CALL BUREAUTPOST BUILDING,
WASHINGTON*. Jan. 12.âWith the
passing- of the tariff problem the more
perplexing one of interstate railroad
rates comes to the front, apparently to
stay, and President Roosevelt has
gained a decided advantage over the
opposition. It seems practically certain
that the House will meet this question
at the present session and pass a bill.
Speaker Cannon is throwing his influ
ence in favor of action and the leaders
of the House will try to agree upon a
measure.
A flank movement by the Democrats
of the House has greatly aided the
President in his efforts for rate legis
lation. A conference of leading Demo
crats was held last night, called by
John Sharp Williams, and it was de
termined to force the Republicans to
cither give or deny a rate bill at this
session. As a result of this conference
the minority of the Interstate Com
merce Committee presented a resolution
to-day in favor of closing the present
series of hearings on January 23, in
order to get together on a bill. A di
rect vote on this was averted to-day,
bui. it will come up again to-morrow.
Two Republicans of the committer â
Representatives Esch of Wisconsin
and Townsend of Michiganâare ready
to vote for the resolution.
SPEARS FOR THE RAILROADS.
Samuel Spencer, president of the
Southern Railway, and authorized to
voice the sentiment of the New York
Central, the Erie, the Chicago, Mil
waukee and St. Paul, the Northern Pa
cific, the Illinois Central, the Lacka
wanna and other railway companies,
spoke vigorously to-day before the
House Committee on Interstate and
Foreign Commerce against the Cooper-
Quarles bill or any proposition to au
thorize the Interstate Commerce Com
mission to fix railway rates. Spencer
Is the first direct and official repre
sentative of the railways to be heard
by the committee, and his testimony is
regarded as the keynote of the opposi
tion to rate-fixing by the Government.
"There is no difference of opinion,"
said Spencer, "between the railroads of
the country, Congress and the Presi
dent on the subject that rebates are
wrong. But I do not think any addi
tional legislation is necessary in order
to proceed against that particular
class of abuses. If such legislation does
appear to Congress to be necessary the
railways of the country will certainly
stand ready to aid and co-operate.
"The question before you is not of
that characterâit is that of the power
to name a rate upon the part of the
commission after complaint and hear
ing. It has been claimed this will be
a means of stopping rebates. This
claim I have no hesitation in disput
ing.
FIXED RATE CAN BE EVADED.
"It is claimed." he continued, "that
this power would be a weapon in the
hands of the commission to prevent re
abates. But a rate fixed by the com
mission can be rebated or evaded Just
as easily as any other. The use of that
weapon. If given to the commission,
would punish not the evader of the rate
but the one which upheld the rate."
The most important claim in behalf
of the proposition Spencer believed to
be that such power would enable the
commission to prevent discrimination
between localities. This question of
adjusting rates between localities, he
said, was the most difficult and intri
cate of all. The present system was
the growth of natural competition not
only between local roads, which would
always exist, but between railroads as
well. To disturb this system, he main
tained, would not only be a task so
enormous that no statement could
convey a comprehension of it, but
would be Impossible of satisfactory
completion in the hands of a body with
authority only to take into considera
tion the one phase of adjusting rates
with reference to their equalization so
far as the carrier was concerned, and
leaving out the question of competition
between localities.
SECRETARY MORTON'S VIEWS.
Paul Morton, Secretary o# the Navy
and formerly vice president of the At
â¢ chlson, Topeka and Santa Fe Railroad
Company, is the author of an article
on the railway rate question which
will be published in the Outlook to
morrow.
The Secretary says there are very few
complaints against railroad rates per
se in the United States, the chief trou
. ble being with "the relation of rates
as between markets." He says there
are as many rates that are too low as

ST. LOUIS, Jan. 12âHereafter the
profits of the factories of the N. O. Nel
son Manufacturing Company will be
apportioned among customers, em
ployes and charities. A statement is
sued by the company follows:
"A dividend of 4 per cent on all
wages received in the last nine years
by employes of one or more years' work
has been declared. For 1905 the profits
will be divided in the proportion of 1
per cent on capital (above 6 per cent
Interest), 1% per cent on wages, 2 per
cent on gross profits of customers' pur
chases."
Another statement issued personally
by President N. O. Nelson follows:
'For 1905 my part of the profits of
the Nelson and its allied companies
(about four-fifths of the whole profits)
will be divided four-tenths to the cus
tomers,, three-tenths to the employes
and three-tenths for public and benev
olent purposes, payable in my stock at
a price yielding 6 per cent net income."
These formal notices convey the in
tent of a new plan of
evolved by Nelson, to replace and be an
improvement upon that in force for
several years in his factories at Ed
wardsville, St. Louis and elsewhere.
Concerning his intentions, Nelson said:
"The plan of co-operation existing for
the last nine years between the com
pany and its employes has been closed,
after having paid to employes divi
dends of from 4 to 10 per cent yearly.
Under the new plan I shall receive no
profits, and will gradually turn over
my stock to those mentioned In the no
tices. For building up, managing and
directing the affairs of the company I
have been sufficiently rewarded. Here
after the profit will be diverted to the
purposes named. I own four-fifths of
the stock, the remainder being held
principally by employes.
"This does not mean that I will sever
my connection with the business, al
though at a continued rate of trade
like the present it would not be long
before my stock will all have been ap
portioned. I shall continue to work for
the company at a salary, which I might
say is smaller than some other em
ployes receive, and after I am no longer
a stockholder it rests with the owners
to determine whether I shall continue
in the employ of the company, my foot
ing being the same as any other em
ploye."
SOLUTION
OF CANCER
PROBLEM
BUFFALO, N. V., Jan. 12.âThe sci
entists who since 1899 have been study
ing cancer at the Gratwick Patho
logical Laboratory of the University of
Buffalo, under the patronage of the
State of New preparing to re
port facts which indicate that they are
nearing the solution of the great prob
lem. The Buffalo laboratory has proved
cancer to be a parasitic disease, infec
tious in type; that it has been trans
planted and reproduced in perfectly
healthy animals; that the reproduction
has been true cancer as it exists in* the
human and that the disease in animals
has been cured by the administration
of a serum prepared in the Buffalo la
boratory.
Experimentally considered, the ques
tions of the cause of cancer and its ab
solute curability are settled facts. What
remains now is the application of the
results of the animal experimentation
to the cure of the disease as It exists in
human beings.
Much work remains to be done before
Dr. Roswell Park, director of the labor
atory, will be prepared to make the
final announcement of the discovery of
a serum suitable for use in the allevia
tion and cure of cancer in human be
ings, but that this will be forthcoming
in due time is an almost assured fact
because of the discoveries which have
been made. The doctors at the univer
sity laboratory have Inoculated mice
with cancer germs and then cured
them by Injections of serum.

RICH WIDOW

Insurance.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SPOKANE. Wash., Jan. 12.âMrs.
Georgia Antrim, the "rich Alaskan
widow," who created a sensation in
Spokane last month by visiting the big
stores, saddlery shops, Jewelry houses
and other establishments frequented by
the wealthy while arranging to open a
luxurious residence in this city, and
who later gained fame by announcing
that $4000 worth of furs had been con
sumed in a small blaze at 1111 Ash
street, has been arrested on the charge
of having perpetrated wholesale frauds
against insurance companies. Detec
tive McPhee went to Seattle and is ex
pected to arrive here with his prisoner
to-morrow.
"We have positive information that
Mrs. Antrim has burned eight resi
dences within the past few months
that she might collect insurance." af
firmed Chief Waller to-night. "These
houses were in this city, Seattle, Ta
coma, Portland and San Francisco. The
money got by the woman from insur
ance companies amounts to thousands
of dollars." '
Mrs. Antrim appeared in Spokane in
the early winter. She seemed pos
sessed of vast wealth, dined at the best
restaurants and let it be generally
known that she was "an Alaskan
widow." She rented a furnished home
of George Cummings. Patrolman Stot
ko, who was tenanting part of the
house, was making efforts to get hence
with his family. Before Stotko got
out, however, the fire came.
Then "Widow Antrim" was arrested
on the unpoetic charge of having stol
en a toilet set from the Krum Drug
Company. To ward off the unpleasant
notoriety the "widow" went to the edi
tor of an evening paper and offered
him $50 to forget that such an unpleas
ant arrest had been made. She offered
a police reporter $60 to cut the arrest
out of his notebook. Both of these ef
forts failed and the unlucky widow for
feited a $50 bond in the Police Court.
She was traced to Seattle and the ar
rest was made.

San Francisco Solons Meet
SACRAMENTO, Jan. 12.âAfter the
adjournment of the general session of
the Senate to-day the San Francisco
delegation met to discuss the merits of
the various bills that have been lntro
â duced by San Franciscans since the
Legislature opened. The delegation
agreed to stand as a unit in favor of
the bill' providing for the appropriation
of $100,000 for the erection and furnish
ing of a new State normal school build
ing at San Francisco.
The discussion on Keane's bill, mak
ing it a misdemeanor to sell or give
away liquors within 1000 feet of any
military reservation in the State,
waxed somewhat warm,, the members
of the delegation being divided on the
question. It was finally agreed to con
tinue the argument until a later day.
Assemblyman Houser is to withdraw
the constitutional amendment Intro
duced by him providing for the dispos
ing of State, city and county moneys in
banks and will present another which,
according to advices received by him
this evening, will be sent him from
Los Angeles. The new one is more com
prehensive than the one introduced by
I Houser and contains a complete

California, though doubtlessly It will
be vigorously opposed by the corpora
tions whose lines enter the State. The
bill will make it an offense for any
railway company to run any train,
either freight or passenger, without a
"full crew." It is contended by vari
ous railway unions that the companies,
actuated solely by motives of economy,
run trains without full crews with the
result that men are denied employ
ment by them and the safety of pas
sengers is frequently Jeopardized.
It is expected that the ratification of
an amendment to the Los Angeles City
charter providing that the life of no
franchise shall be more than 21 years
will be fought by a powerful street
raiiway lobby sent here for that pur
pose. The resolution of ratification
will be Introduced by Assemblyman
Houser in the House. It is not known
who will lead the opposition, but it is
said the support of all the Los Angeles
delegation will not be Denind the res
olution. The rapid growth of Los An

LOS ANGELES, Jan. 12.â1t would be
difficult to find a happier home than
that of Senator-elect Flint. Successful
though he has been in his professional
and political life, his achievements
have not been bought at the price of
domestic happiness. He never has per
mitted his popularity with his fellow
men to draw him from his fireside. He
is blessed with a charming familyâa
wife and two children, Risley, aged 12
years, aÂ»d Katherine, aged 14. Mrs.
Flint, while not a society woman In the
strict sense of the term, is very popu
lar. She is an active worker in the
Second Presbyterian Church, of which
her husband and children also are
members! and in the Ebell Club. She
was formerly Miss Katherine Bloss,
daughter of a well-known hotel pro
prietor of Merced.
Miss Katherine Flint is a bright pu
pil In the Marlborough School. She de
clares she will be the first person on
the special train to-morrow to meet her
father and tell him how glad she is.
She and her brother share their father's
companionship as few children do.
Master Risley attends an East Side
public school and ever since his father
has been a candidate for the Senator
ship he has conducted a personal cam

"Goodness, I feel as if I was most
President," declared Risley when he

Clash Is Likely

Patronage,
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO, Jan. 12.âAfter a
wild night in Sacramento the Flint
boomers, headed by the United States
Senator-elect, took an early train to
day for the south. It is assumed that
they took the train as they took the
town last night.
Both houses of the Legislature will
prabably adjourn to-morrow until
Monday. That the session will extend
considerably beyond the sixty days
prescribed by the constitution Is now
deemed certain, as very little headway
has been made with the regular work.
There are premonitions of a clash be
tween the Governor and several State
Senators in reference to the distribu
tion of what is commonly known as
"executive patronage." The notion
prevails in the Senate that the chief
executive should accept the advice of
Senators regarding the fitness and abil
ity of men who may be appointed to
the offices of honor and emolument.
The fact is recalled that neither Mark
ham, Budd nor Gage, while holding the
office of Governor, went out of their
way to get the advice of the Senate in
the matter of appointments and there
are no signs that Governor Pardee will
lose sleep in a feverish desire to estab
lish new forms for the distribution of
patronage. It is said that the Governor
is really held responsible for the ap
pointments and that his hands should
be free to select such men as will carry
out the policies of the administration
with reference to the management of
the public institutions wholly supported
by the State.

SAN JOSE, Jan. 12.âUnited States
Senator Frank P. Flint was tendered
an informal reception by a number of
San Joseans at the depot this evening
at 7:30 on his way to Los Angeles.
Word that Flint was to pass through
the city became known this afternoon,
and O. A. Hale and former State Sen
ator Oneal gathered a number of
their friends to welcome and congratu
late the new Senator. In the Sena
tor's party were W. R. Porter of Wat
sonville, M. C. Patterson, R. Wonkow
sky, John Burr and Messrs. Jeffrays
and Jones of Los Angeles.
Senator Flint and his party alighted
from the car, and during the stay of
the train shook hands and chatted
with the San Joseans, of whom there
were about a score.
FLINT GIVEN RECEPTION.
Senator-elect Flint, accompanied by
a large delegation of Los Angelans,
arrived from Sacramento yesterday
and departed for the south on the
evening train. During the day he re
ceived many friends in his rooms at
the Palace, and at noon he was the
guest of the Union League Club at an
informal reception.
Before his departure last evening
for his southern home Senator Flint
said he was going home to attend to
several business matters and would
then return to San Francisco. He
expects to visit and thoroughly in

order to acquaint himself with its

over Waste's resolution that no- addi

veloped that there remains one man in
the house who still has some patronage
left. Coyle asked if the resolution was
adopted would it in any way affect

all of his, as he had not seen fit to do
so. He added, though, that he might
use it in future and any idea that he

Treadwell of San Francisco opposed
the resolution on the ground that un
der a provision of the Political Code no
further attaches could be appointed ex

code preceded any resolution.
The roll was called and the Waste

It provides that no detective or agency

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, JANUARY 13, 1905.
Appointive Power of State's
Chief Executive Is to
Be Curtailed.
SACRAMENTO, Jan. 12.âSenators
expect that the Governor's appointive
power will henceforth be limited sole
ly to the initiative, with the referen
dum resting: In the Senate, as it has
always presumably been, but has been
allowed to go by the breach. When the
Republican caucus convened this
morning the Senators marched in with
lowering brows. It was apparent that
something was up, and it soon devel
oped into a practically unanimous de
termination to trim the Governor's
wings and place the men he names for
public office at the mercy of the Sen
ate, which shall have the final word
as to their fitness and capability.
The caucus was no sooner called to
order than a resolution was presented
expressing the sense of the Republican
members of the upper house that any
officials that may be appointed by the
chief executive of the State during the
present session of the Legislature shall
be submitted to the caucus for its con
firmation. It was decided that every
name submitted shall be subjected to
the closest scrutiny, and the owner
thereof must not only be fit to hold
public office in every sense of the word,
but must be entitled to consideration
at the hands of the party, his right to
such consideration being based on his
deeds, not his claims.
EXECUTIVE APPOINTMENTS.
,But, it was pointed out, the Governor
might dc as Governors had done for
time immemorialâwait until the Leg
islature'adjourned and then distribute
his patronage, leaving the confirmation
of his appointees to a Senate commit
tee, the function of which was purely
formal and never intended to question
the wisdom of the Governor's selec
tions. The result was that when the
Senate went into general session Sen
ator Ralston presented a bill having as
its purpose the amendment of the pres
ent Jaw relating to executive appoint
ments, the proposed amendment being
as follows:
Vacancies occurring in office during: the re
cess of the Legislature, tne appointment to
which is vested in the Governor and Senate
and Legislature must be filled by appointment
made by the Governor, and tne person so ap
pointed shall hold office for the full term of
his appointment, provided, however, that in the
caÂ«e the Senate refuses or fails to confirm such
appointment at the session of the
rext succeeding, said office shall, upon the final
adjournment of the Legislature, become Imme
diately vacant and .the said appointee shall not
be eligib.e to appointment for said vacancy.
Without doubt this bill will be
passed, and from the hands of the
Governor the larger portion of the pat
ronage that heretofore has been sup
posed to be solely his will practically
pass to the Senate. It is a shrewd
move on the part of the Solons, for,
while it is hardly probable that they
will declare any of the Governor's ap
pointees unfit to enjoy a public trust,
it is quite probable that it will lead the
Governor to first discuss with the lead
ers of the upper house the merits of the
claims of the small army that is wait
ing for the favors of the executive.
LOWERING OP LAKE LEVELS.
An important measure was presented
for the consideration of the upper
house by Coggins this morning. It pro
vides for the granting of permission to
the Governor for the lowering of the
"water levels of the Little Klamath,
Rhett, Goose and Clear lakes In Siski
you and Modoc counties, and the plac
ing of the bedÃ of the same at the dis
posal of the Government to be utilized
In the water storage and reclamation
service.
Senator Woodward Introduced a se
ries of bills calling for appropriations
for the enlargement of the Home for
the Care and Training' of Feeble-
Minded Children at Glen Ellen that, if
passed, will mean much toward assur
ing the increased comfort of the un
fortunates whose minds have been
darkened by unkind fate. The bills
provide for the appropriation of $17,600
for a building for fifty female epilep
tics; $20,000 for a dormitory for thirty
male attendants; $17,500 for a cottage
for female patients; $5000 for new roads
and fences; $8000 for the completion of
the hospital and to erect three cottages
for cripples and paralytics; $66,000 fot
the completion of the main building
| and $6500 for the construction of a res
ervoir to hold 420,000 gallons and tc
purchase fire appartus.
A bill that will interest the members
of Beveral of the women's clubs of the
State Was introduced and referred tc
the committee on fish and game. It
makes it a misdemeanor punishable by
fine or imprisonment, or both, for kill
ing meadow larks at any time of the
year, except when such birds are killed
while destroying berries or fruits. The
i meadow lark is California's singing
bird, ami to protect it from destruc
tion the women of the State have been
most active. It is said, however, that
! the farmers of the State will fight the
| measure, contending that not only dc
I the meadow larks destroy much fruit,
< but that a flock of them can strip a
: grain field cleaner than a million grass
i hoppers.
I ARMS FOR SONS OF VETERANS.
In the form of a resolution presented
!by Senator Savage the initial step to
arm the Sons of Veterans was taken
this morning. The resolution, after set
ting forth that the' National Guard is
' being re-armed with the Krag-Jorgen
! sen rifles, states that the 'old National
â  Guard arm, the Springfield rifle, is
' being stacked awly in the armories
; and is of use to no one. It provides
I that action be taken to secure the re
! lease of these arms from the Govern-
I ment for the use of the Sons of Vet
erans, which in time will become a
valuable third line of defense.
Senator Keane of San Francisco in
troduced a bill to-day that recalled the
great railroad strike that occurred over
a decade ago. It provides for the ap
propriation of $10,000 for the relief of
Lawrence J. Dunnigan, who as a mem

ber of the National Guard was shot in
the knee and permanently crippled
while engaged in quieting rioters. Sev
eral of the guardsmen that were injured
during the strike have been assisted by
the State and Keane says. Dunnigan
is the only one that has not been cared
for.

DEMOCRATS TO AID THE PRESIDENT
Continued From Page 1. Column 1.
there are rates which a court would de
cide to be too high, and that either
class of rates may be equally disas
trous to communities. He expresses
the. opinion that Federal supervision
of railroads is necessary, but adds that
regulation and protection should go to
gether. He says that one of the fol
lowing three things is sure to take
place in the conduct of our railways:
FirstâLegalization of pools â the
right of the railroads to make enforcl
ble contracts between themselves as
to a division of earnings, so that they
can resist the temptations of big ship
pers and be assured a fair share of the
business moving at stable rates which
shall apply alike to all patrons.
SecondâThe further Unification of
ownership, thereby delivering in time
the er.llre railway ownership of the
country into the hands of a few in
dividuals or one syndicate.
ThirdâGovernment ownership, the
worst of the three "evils," if such they
may be called.
In the opinion of Morton, government
ownership of our railroads would be the
beginning of industrial and political
chaos. He rather favors the first prop
osition, with adequate provision to as
sure the rates being reasonable.
As to pending rates, he favors the
continuance of the Interstate Com
merce Commission in substantially its
present form.

BAILEY OPENS ATTACK
Raises Point That Marine
Board Had Been Committed
to Discriminating Duties
WASHINGTON, Jan. 12.âThe legis
lative, executive and Judicial approp
riation bill was read to-day at length
in the Senate and there was consider
able discssion of the civil service ques
tion and the provision for an investi
gation of foreign trade conditions by
the Department of Commerce and La
bor.
I The bill for the merchant marine was
j reported to the Senate and Bailey of
Texas made the point that the com
j mission had been pledged to report in
I favor of discriminating duties and not
|in favor of ship subsidies. The sug
j gestion was combated by Senators
Gailinger and Lodge, who were mem
bers of the commission.
The bill, as reported by the commis
sion had been amended In only one
important particular by the Commerce
commitee. An Increased mall subven
tion was authorized for the proposed
; new route from a port on the Pacific
; Coast to Hawaii, Japan, China and
' the Philippines. For a monthly serv
ice the subvention was increased from
$300,000 to $400,000, and for a fortnight

Members of the committee feared that
the subvention proposed by the com

JUDGE SWAYNE
NOT FRIENDLESS
Littlefleld of Maine Cham
pions the Cause of the
Florida Federal Jurist
TAKES LAMAR TO TASK
Congressman Who Filed the
Charges Accused of In
citing Act of Violence
WASHINGTON, Jan. 12.âThe House
of Representatives to-day devoted its
entire session to the discussion of im
peachment charges against Judge
Charles Swayne of the Northern Dis
trict of Florida. A dramatic incident
occurred when Littlefleld of Maine
called upon Lamar of Florida, who filed
the charges against the Judge, to admit
or repudiate an alleged interview,
which the former claimed tended to in
cite the people* to commit an act of vio
lence against Judge Swayne. Lamar
admitted having given an interview,
but emphatically denied any suggestion
from him that could be construed into
advising assassination or murder. He
said that, although Judge Swayne was
known to be the most lawless man in
Florida he had remained secure from
bodily harm,
Lamar declared that, while he did not
think Littlefleld Intentionally charged
him with inciting murder, Littlefleld
certainly had almost blindly misappre
hended what really was said. If, said
Lamar, any one used his language in
the interview to impute that he sug
gested violence to Judge Swayne he
would denounce it as a malicious false
hood.
"The gentleman's denunciation dis
turbs nobody," replied Littlefleld, who
added that, unfortunately for Lamar,
the ordinary citizen of the United
States would so construe It, "and It is
for that reason the language does great
violence to the character of the distin
guished gentleman from Florida."

POLITICS BACK
OF SMOOT CASE
Witnesses Say Crusade Is
Not Directly Against the
Practice of Polygamy
SIMPLY AFTER VOTES
Idaho Democratic Leaders
Accused of Having Sacri
ficed Candidate Parker
WASHINGTON, Jan. 12â Nearly the
entire day in the Smoot investigation
was devoted to testimony relating to
political conditions in ( Idaho. Frank
Martin and F. H. Holzheimer, promi
nent Idaho Democrats, testified that a
majority of the Democrats of the State
opposed "an unnecessary attack" on
the Mormon church, which, they said,
was the effect of the anti-polygamy
plank of the party's State platform.
James H. Brady, chairman of the Re
publican State Committee, charged
that ths Democrats traded off Judge
Parker, the Democratic candidate for
President, for former Senator Heitfeld,
the Democratic candidate for Gover
nor.
Frank Martin, who is an attorney of
Boise, Idaho, said he never had known
of any instance of Mdrmon interfer
ence with the politics of Idaho. He
had heard it charged that Mormon in
fluence had defeated former Governor
Morrison for renomination, but he be
lieved 80 per cent of the people did not
credit the charge. The witness ex
pressed the opinion that it was an an
nouncement by Senator Dubois that he
intended to push the Smoot investiga
tion that provoked the Mormon con
troversy of the last campaign.
Martin, on the conclusion of his testi
mony, volunteered the statement that
personally he favored prosecuting those
who continued polygamous cohabita
tion, but the majority of Gentiles be
lieved the best way was to "let the old
fellows die off." '
James H. Brady of Pocatello, Idaho,
chairman of the Republican State Com
mittee, said the last campaign was not
fairly started before it developed that
the Democrats were not fighting poly
gamy, but Mormonism. Senator Du
bois, he said, tried to turn all Mor
mon votes into the Republican col
umn, and Chairman of the Republican
Committee Witt tried to get all the
votes he could by circulating copies
of Senator Dubois' letter to former
Governor McConnell to the effect that
all Mormons were criminals.
The witness said he was Satisfied
that Judge Parker, the Democratic
candidate for President, was sacrificed
by the Democrats wherever it was pos
sible to get a vote for Heitfeld, the
Democratic candidate for Governor.

NEW SENSATION
Discharges Her Attorney in
Court, and Demands That
She Be Given a Hearing
DENOOTC ES WITNESSES
Says Their Evidence Is Per
jured and Slanders Mem
ory of Her Dead Uncle
Bee Taylor, In Judge Troutt's court
yesterday, gave a sample of her facil
ity in ,-xpressing her own opinions,
like unto that which caused her to
achieve national notoriety and lose a
government position in Washington by
a published criticism of the adminis
tration's Filipino policy. In the mat
ter of a few moments of time she
rep-j 'lated her attorney, demanded a
hearing In her own behalf, criticized
the court, voiced her disregard of rules
of judicial procedure, and branded the
witnesses on the other side of her case
as perjurers and slanderers of the dead.
The incident was as dramatic as it
was unexpected. Miss Taylor is execu
trix of the will of her late uncle, J. D.
Taylor, and is defending a contest in
stituted by Lizzie Taylor McÃride, a
sister of the deceased, who was not in
cluded in the list of beneficiaries. The
hearing, as far as the attorneys on both
sides were concerned, was concluded at
noon, and Colonel Barry, who repre
sents Miss Taylor, and I*. T. Wagner,
nrtorney for Mrs. McÃride, were dis
cussing with the court as to when they
should file their briefs. When the Judge
announced that the case should be sub
mitted Miss Taylor rushed to Colonel
Barry's side and asked him to call her
as a witness. The lawyer made a nega
tive gesture and the woman stepped up
to the railing, faced the court and
cried: "Your Honor, 1 demand a hear
ing in my own behalf."
"How?" asked Judge Troutt.
"On the witness stand, I want to
testify to a conversation I had with
some of these witnesses when they told
me something directly opposite to what
they said here." By this time Miss
Taylor had reached the front of the
Judge's desk and was much excited.
DISCHARGES BARRY.
"But you are too late, madame, the
case has been submitted," said the
Judge,'' but Miss Taylor became more
insistent. "Who is your attorney?"
asked the court.
"Colonel Barry is, if he will represent
me; if he won't I will be my own at
torney," she said.
. Judge Troutt asked Colonel Barry
whether he wanted his client to testi
fy, and the lawyer answered "no,"
whereupon Miss Taylor shouted: "Then
1 discharge him. I have no attorney.
1 notify you now that I have no at
torney and I demand the right to be
in my own behalf."
Xoticing her fixedness of purpose,
* !â¢ rk Kennedy half arose from his seat
wuh the intention of removing Miss
Taylor from her position, but Judge
Truutl bade him refrain and, for the
purpose of hearing her complaint in a
more regular way, invited her to take
the witness stand. Mere she declined to
take the customary oath, but "af
firmed" tr t her testimony would be
the truth.
Colonel Barry thereupon proceeded to
ion her along the lines she had
indicated and the third query brought
to the matter of an alleged conversa
tion she had with Mrs. Talbott, keeper
of the lodging-house where Taylor
died. Attorney Wagner objected to the
evidence, as the conversation had taken
.place after the death of the testator.
Judge Troutt sustained the objection.
Miss Taylor became angry. She rose
from her chair and said, "I have a
i ii, r ht to be heard and to show how this
woman has slandered my dead. She
told me the very opposite of what she
testified to." Judge Troutt said her
attorney had prepared the case and
tried it elaborately and advised her to
consult him.
WILL NOT BE STIFLED.
"I desire to be my own attorney,"
said the woman, doggedly. "There Is no
power In the United States to stifle a
witness who wants to show in her own
behalf that another witness has per
jured herself. I have no counsel, and
no court In Christendom can say that I
have not the right to appear for my
self; I have discharged him and will'
not have him imposed upon me.
"I have been threatened that this will
would be broken if I did not do certain
things," said Miss Taylor. "I can show
what influenced this woman to perjure
herself."
The Judge admonished her to reflect
a little, and she said the more she re
flected the more she saw it was her
conscience and her duty not to let her
' dead be slandered."
."Your spirit is admirable, madame."
said the court, and she retorted: "in
other remarks from this bench, in the
trial of a claim against this estate,
you showed your disapprobation of my
conduct."
The Judge replied that he would de
cide matters according to law and jus
tice, and if remarks were necessary he
reserved the right to make them in his
own way, but he was sorry that he had
caused her any annoyance.
Then the case went over until 2
o'clock, and when the parties reap
peared Colonel Barry said that he was
obliged to remain in the case' until he
was replaced In the only way possibleâ
by the regular substitution of another
attorney, and if one was not substitut
' d. to maintain his standing at the bar,
he \v ould argue the case he had present
ed, find he asked the court not to let his
client's conduct prejudice her rights.
Mish Taylor insisted that she had a
kind filing for her attorney, but that
she had been taken by surprise, and as
â¢ xecutrix demanded the right to pro
duce other witnesses to rebut "the per
jured creatures who said my uncle was
an imbecile."
Judge Troutt closed the incident by
continuing the hearing until next
Thursday.

NIGHT-AND-DAY
BANK ASSURED
Site Is Purchased for
the Proposed Financial
Concern in New York
Special Diipatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Jan. 12.âWith the ac
quisition of a site at the southeast
corner of Fifth avenue and Forty
fourth street, a district of fashionable
restaurants and hotels, the first r.ight
and-day bank is to be established.
Delmonico'g and Sherry's will be its
neighbors.
All preliminaries were settled to-day
at a meeting of the directors and with
in a few months the new institution
will be established in a commodious
building to be devoted entirely to its
uses. In conection with the bank there
will operate a night and day safe de
posit company. Its aim is to provide
means by which its depositors may
have the use of their funds at any
hour out of the twenty-four. Those
who wish sums of money in an emer
gency will find the night and day bank
useful, for there will always be a
cashier at its paying window.
The idea was suggested by the ex
periences of several men who, although
they had large sums of money In down
town banks, were unable to get money
for an emergency. Heretofore all night
banking business has been done by
restaurants and hotels and it was
necessarily limited.
For the accommodation of those who
attend the opera the safety deposit de
partment of the bank was primarily
organized. Women returning from the
opera or other places of amusement
may leave their jewels in the vaults of
the company before returning home.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
Dr. F. H. Stice, assistant physician of
the institution, testified that he was
in B. ward at 7 o'clock on the night of
December 25, that Louis was lying on
the floor dead, that he had no cloth
ing on though shortly before his death
he was wearing his trousers and shirt.
The sheet on the bed had a large blood
stain on it at that time. When Stice
returned to the ward at 10:30 o'clock
that night the sheet was wet the blood
stain having been washed out.
Harvey Grigsby testified that he was
in B. ward on the afternoon of Decem
ber 25, that he saw a fierce struggle
between Shanahan, Retzman and
Louis, that the attendants got the
patient down one holding him at the
head, the other at feet. Cross-exam-
ination by F. E. Johnston brought out
the fact that Grigsby did not see the
defendants jump on Louis though the
testimony of Dr. Stice showed that
nearly every one of Louis' ribs was
broken before his death. Court then
adjourned till Friday morning when
the hearing will be resumed.

NEW YORK, Jan. 12.âEmlle Bru

Francisco, but more recently engaged
In theatrical ventures in New York, is

"The Baroness Fiddlesticks." The
peculiar feature of "The Baroness Fid

McKEES SAIL
FOR EUROPE
Secrecy Which Characterized
the Bride's Home-Coming
Attends Their Departure
*
WEDDING A SURPRISE
Parents Not Informed of
the Plan Until a Few
Hours Before the Ceremony
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Jan. 12.âMr. and
! Mrs. A. Hart McKee, who were mar
' ried In Philadelphia on Wednesday.
| sailed to-day for Europe on the Tou
j raine. Their departure was attended
jby the same secrecy which character
ized the bride's return from Europe.
The couple returned to this city to
day and went at once to the French
line pier. When the Touralne sailed
there was only one of McKee's friends
on the pier.
Most of the mystery concerning
Mrs. Tevis' movements since she re
turned to the United States remains
unsolved. As a matter of fact, not
even the parents of young McKee
knew that, the attractive Denver wid-
I ow was in this country until Wednes
day morning.
The first suspicion that Mr. and
Mrs. Sellers McKee had of her pres
-1 ence here was when Hart McKee told
j his mother on Wednesday morning he
J wished that she and his father would
j take a run over to Philadelphia with
{ him. The party boarded an early
1 train and on arriving in Philadelphia
' went to the Aldine Hotel. Hart left
j his parents, saying he would return in
jan hour. He did so and then told
i them that Mrs. Tevis was at the Ho
i tel Walton and that he wished they
' would call there with him.
Mrs. Tevis, radiant as usual, met
them with the announcement that she
and Hart had decided to get married.
"It is better, I think," said Mrs.
Tevis, "to have it over now. There is
no impediment to our marriage, now
| that Hart's divorce has been granted.
' One of the things that has prompted
;me to hasten my marriage is that I
i wish to show the world that even in
t the face of the stories published about
; Hart's cruelty to his former wife I
still have perfect faith in him."
j While the subject was being talked
I over Colonel Baxter, Mrs. Tevis'
father, who had come on from Knox
! ville. Term., to take his son to school
jat Newport, had stopped over in Phil
! adelphia. All agreed that Mrs. Tev
j is' suggestion was a good one and a
j clergyman was sent for. Even after
i the ceremony the bride did not take
j her parents into her confidence con
-1 cerning how she happened to be m
j Philadelphia when she was supposed
|to be in France.
Before sailing Hart McKee said he
i and his bride were going at once to
j Mintone, where Mrs. McKee has a
' villa. They will return to New York
next fall.
j PHILADELPHIA, Jan. 12.â"I'm
; heartily sorry that I was the clergy
i man selected to perform the mar
riage," said Rev. E. Yates Hill, pastor
lof the First Presbyterian Church, In
j explaining his part in the secret cere
! mony that united A. Hart McKee and
i Mrs. Tevis. Not until this morning
j did the clergyman learn their identity.

as a result she handed to me a diamond

the Hotel Astor and met Mr. and Mrs.
Brugulere at luncheon. * â¢ â¢ He asked
me to take It to a pawnbroker, which
I did, getting $2000, which I handed to
Mr. Bruguiere.
"Mr. Bruguiere on a certain day sent
Mr. Sheldon up to her house to get
some stuff, which was delivered to him.
In the lot were a gold belt and various
diamond stick pins, valued at between
$5000 and $8000. Mr. Bruguiere, when I
called, had this stuff on his desk and
he personally sent It out to be pawned."

FROM INSOMNIA
j English Author Compelled
to Go to Switzerland to
Rest His Overtaxed Brain
j RENOWN IS INCREASING
House That Coleridge Spent
His Last Years In to Make
Way for Modern Building
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LONDON, Jan. 12.âHall Calne's;
I state of health has been causing his
friends a good deal of uneasiness of
I late. He has not been himself for a â 
| year or more, and it may be remem- '
j bered that when "The Prodigal Son" j
j was only half written its author broke '
| down and had to go to St. Moritz to j
finish the work. He stayed there sev
eral months, and when he returned to
the Isle of Man recently it was hoped
that he could keep going for quite a
while, but evidently the task of seeing I
his latest novel through the press and
the part he took in the discussion that '
I followed Its publication were too much ;
j for Hall Calne. For several weeks he
baa suffered from acute insomnia, and i
jon Saturday last left for Switzerland, |
j where his physician has ordered him to ;
j make a lengthy stay.
Meanwhile his renown Is increasingâ i
|on this side of the water, at leastâat a
â  rate which must make his keen rival,
: Miss Corelll, rather jealous. The other
1 day the Rev. R. J. Campbell, the
| brainy young successor of Dr. Joseph
! Parker at the City Temple, declared in I
a public address that he preferred the i
i Manxman's best work to that of George
; Meredith, and during Christmas week :
j another incident was recorded which :
{ testified, in a way, to the potency of
j the name of Came. This was the sale,
to a fashionable butcher, of a bullock |
I bred on the novelist's model farm tn I
! the Isle of Man for $242 60, or $2 50
j more than was paid recently for a slm- j
liar beast reared by the King.
After several years .of literary work
in London Morley Roberts, who wrote
"Rachel Marr," has followed the ex- ,
ample of so many of his confreres and i
taken a country house where he means \
to do most of his writing in future. ;
Tappington Grange, as it is called, Is
near Wadsworth and may be said, In a
way, to have literary associations al
ready, having belonged up to now to
Bit George Barham, one of the family
of which the author of "The Ingolsby
Legends" was a member.
LITERARY LANDMARK.
One of the most interesting of
don's literary landmarks is now threat
ened with destruction âthis being the
house In Highgate, Hampstead, where
Samuel Taylor Coleridge spent his last
years and where he was visited, at dif
ferent times, 'by Carlyle, Leigh Hunt,
Wordsworth, Charles Lamb and Robert
Southey. The house, which It is now
intended to replace with a modern
building, is No. 3 in the Grove, Hamp- j
stead, and formerly belonged to Dr.
James Gilman. This physician was the
devoted friend of Coleridge. He threw
! open his doors to the author of "The ,
j Ancient Mariner" when he was suffer
| ing most horribly from the effects of
[ his prolonged indulgence In opium, and
j for eighteen years safeguarded him
J from his dangerous habit. Of his con- |
i dition at that time Coleridge wrote: j
"The degradation, the blighted utility, |
i almost overwhelm me." However,
while in Hampstead he got back much
of his power and produced some of his
finest proseâthe "Aids to Reflection,"
the two "Lay Sermons" and the essay
"On the Constitution of Church and
State."
The visits of his great literary con
freres to his home in "The Grove" were
especially delightful to Coleridge.
"He sat," wrote Carlyle, "looking
down on London and its smoke-tumult
like a sage escaped from the inanity of
life's battle, attracting toward him the
thoughts of innumerable brave souls
still engaged there âheavy-laden, high
aspiring and surely much-suffering,
man."
Coleridge died at The Grove in July,
1834, and he lies in the yard of the old ;
chapel at Highgate, now the crypt ot
the new Grammar School Chapel.
The governing body of that square !
mile of London known as the "city" ;
Is chiefly devoted to keeping alive an
cient traditions and customs, and main
taining intact at its civic functions
that most sacred of things, the order
of precedence. This fact lends particu
lar appropriateness to the subject of
the new fresco by Edwin A. Abbey in
the courtyard of the Royal Exchange
which was unveiled the other day with i
much ceremony. It represents a I
memorable Incident in the history of
the Merchant Taylors' and Skinners'
companies.
Between these two ancient guilds
there was much Jealousy and rivalry, j
which often threatened to develop Into' j
riot and bloodshed as to which of them '
was entitled to march before the other
in processions within the City of Lon
don. Titled folk whose inherited re
nown constitutes their sole claim to
distinction occasionally still quarrel bit
terly even nowadays over the same
question of precedence.
AN ENGLISH SOLOMON.
The two companies in 1484 submitted
their quarrel to the decision of the
Lord Mayor of that year, Sir Robert '
Billesden. and he for the "norlshing
of peas (peace) and love betweene the
Masters, Wardeyns and Feoiashipps
aforesaid," rendered this judgment:
"That the Masters and Wardens
should dine each year together at their
respective halls, the Taylors with the j
Skinners on the Vigil of Corppis ,
Christl, and the Skinners with the Tay- i
lors on the Feast of the Nativity of St. |
John Baptist; and as to precedency, !
each company was to have that on each j
alternate year, save that a Mayor of i
either should give that company pre- 1
cedence in his year of office."
The decree has been faithfully ob- j
served ever since and unbroken "peas
and love" have reigned between the I
two "Feoiashipps."
The fresco, the thirteenth of the !
series, reveals all the superb decorative
effect for which Abbey is famous. At
the foot of the chair of state of the
Lord Mayor the two masters are de
picted pledging one another in a loving
cup.. Behind them is a gallery filled
with ladies; in the left foreground is a
herald In a tabard of the arms of the
ADVERTISEMENTS.

"lan Maclaren," author of "The Bon
nie Briar Bush," gave a lecture on
"Kindness in Fiction," at Liverpool,
the other day, in which he protested
against the inhumanity of the novel of
to-day. ,
"The note of kindness is conspicu
ously absent from modern fiction," said
Dr. Watson. "In what are accounted
the best writers of to-day, you will be
struck rather by a want of sympathy."
Such writers, the lecturer went on,
took the life of the East End, and drew
it with remarkable accuracy of detail
and considerable power of description.
But they did not touch it with a gentle
hand. They treated the life of mean
streets and mean people much as an
anatomist treated a body on the dis
secting table.
"Or," Dr. Watson proceeded, "such
writers take the life of society, and
before the reader puts the book down he
is left with the idea, probably erron
eous, that in what is called society
there is hardly one man who is honor
able, or one, woman who is chaste."
"lan Maclaren" expressed the opin
ion that the three writers of English
fiction who will most likely remain the
greatestâ Thackeray, Scott and Dlck
-1 ensâare marked by the same note of
humanity.

CATARRH OF THE STOMACH.
A Pleasant, Simple, but Safe and Ef
fectual Cure for It.
Catarrh of the stomach has long
been considered the next thing to in
curable. The usual symptoms are a
full or bloating sensation after eating,
accompanied sometimes with sour or
watery risings, a formation of gases,
causing pressure on the heart and
lungs and difficult breathing, head*
aches, fickle appetite, nervousness and
a general played out, languid feeling.
There is often a foul taste in the
mouth, coated tongue and if the in
terior of the stomach could be seen it
would show a slimy, inflamed condition.
The cure for this common and ob
stinate trouble is found in a treatment
which causes the food to be readily,
thoroughly digested before it has time
to ferment and irritate the delicate
mucous surfaces of the stomach. To
secure a prompt and healthy digestion
is the one necessary thing to do and
when normal digestion is secured the
catarrhal condition will have disap
peared.
According to Dr. Harlanson the safest
and best treatment Is to use after each
meal a tablet, composed of Diastase,
Aseptic Pepsin, a little Nux, Golden
Seal and fruit acids. These tablets can
now be found at all drug stores under
the name of Stuart's Dyspepsia Tab
lets and not being a patent medicine
can be used with perfect safety and
assurance that healthy appetite and
thorough digestion will follow their
regular use after meals.
Mr. R. S. Workman, Chicago, Ills.,
writes: "Catarrh Is a local condition
resulting from a neglected cold in the
head, whereby the lining membrane of
the nose becomes inflamed and the
poisonous discharge therefrom passing
backward into the throat reaches the
stomach, this producing catarrh of the
stomach. Medical authorities pre
scribed for me for three years for
catarrh of stomach without cure, but
to-day I am the happiest of men after
using only one box of Stuart's Dys
pepsia Tablets. I can not find appro
priate words to express my good feel
ing. I have found flesh, appetite and
sound rest from their use."
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets Is the
safest preparation as well as the
simplest and most convenient remedy
for any form of indigestion, catarrh
of stomach, biliousness, sour stomach,
heartburn and bloating after meals.

The movement -to have an organiza
tion of the California fruit and vege
table canners originated with Walter
M. Field of Los Gatos, who sent out
invitations that resulted in bringing
together three score representative
business men yesterday in this city to
counsel. Mr. Field was at the meet
ing/and presented a hint for a form
of organization such as he had in mind.
Canners' organizations exist In East
ern States and hold annual conven
tions, in which the interests of Califor
nia are not represented In the least.
One of these organizations is in New
HTork. Its plan was explained by Mr.
Field to the California canners. The
basis of the New York organization
was acceptable for this State, he said,
and he read a section of the plan, which
1c as follows:
The object of this association shall be to
foster the Interests of th-> canned goods pack
ers of the State of New York; to protect them
from unjust and unlawful exactions; to reform
abuses in trade; to diffuse accurate and reli
able information among the members regarding
the standing of merchants and other matters:
to produce uniformity and certainty In tbe
customs and usages of trade; to promote a
more friendly intercourse between packers; to
encourage legislation looking to the protection
and fostering of the packing Interests of the
State and to consummate any other results
which shall tend to euard. maintain and pub
lish the high reputation attained by the can
ning Industry in this State in the packing of
wholesome foods.
This was submitted to the committee
on organization at a meeting last even
ing and was discussed preparatory to
reaching a report to go to the canners
: to-day.
It was supposed when the canners
met that they would be able to get
; through with their business yesterday,
\ but they had a dinner at the Hotel St.
Francis. This was followed by a the
ater party at the Columbia, and so a
; second day was needed.
L. F. Graham presided and was the
temporary chairman at the initial pro
: ceedings. and Howard C. Rowley, ed
\ itor of the California Fruit Grower,
: was secretary.
The situation was brought out with
\ some clearness in papers submitted to
the meeting. Â«
R. I. Bentley discussed pure food and
; pure food laws, and said that an in
justice is done by food commissioners,
who allege that borax and boracic acid
are used by California packers in put
ting up fruit and vegetables. The story
is untrue, but there is no need of public
' disavowal. Food manufacturers are
j placed too much at the mercy of chem
ists who may be hostile,
i "It should be the purpose of all deal
ers In or manufacturers of food pro
-1 ducts, individually and collectively,"
said Mr. Bentley. "to use their influ
j ence to the end that, while the move
! ment to protect the public health must
not be opposed or retarded, in the en
: actment of pure food laws and the reg
j ulations which shall control pure food
j commissions our rights shall not be lost
sight of."
Mansfield Lovell spoke of contracts
and buyers' labels.

about transportation and criticised the

from 30,000 to 40,000 pounds. He said
that the free distribution of California
canned goods in the East would be lim
ited by these measures, and that the
East would be correspondingly bene
fited at the expense of this State.
Isidor Jacobs, president of the Califor
nia Canneries Company, discussed sup
ply and demand as related to California
canned goods. He said in part:
The trend of the time Is to bring about a
much wider distribution, resulting in a much
greater demand for our canned fruits, both
domestic and foreign. They must be placed
closer to the consuming public. In such a way
that the consuming public generally may be
come aware that they are getting quality pur
chased. The business, so far as quality Is
concerned, must be brought back to old lines,
â o that every can bearing the name "Califor
nia" must be either flrst-class goods which
will be a credit to the name California, or
the cheaper grades. If they have the name
California on them at all, should have a desig
nation of grade so the consumer may know
what he is getting. In this way can we again
make the name California distinctive and In
dividual in connection with California's canned
fruits to the benefit of our State. Then, In
stead of the supply b-Mng regulated by f the
demand, the demand will be regulated by the
supply, and prosperity and wealth will be the
lot of the California fruit canner.
The deliberations will be resumed at
3 p. m. to-day.

WYMAN TRIAL
NEARING CLOSE
Case of the Accused Ballot-
Box Stuffer Will Go to
Jury Before End of Week
INTIMATES MORE FRAUD
District Attorney Byington
Bouses the Indignation
of Defendant's Counsel
A pertinent question put by District i
Attorney Byington to W. J. Foster
broke the monotony of the Wyman
trial yesterday evening. "Did not
Charles Wyman write the name of S.
H. Mann on the precinct roster and im
mediately after it write the name of ,
George Adler?"
In an instant the defendant's attor
ney exclaimed, "Your Honor, I think
the conduct of the District Attorney is
unpardonable. I move that the jury be
Instructed to disregard the question."
The motion was granted.
"Did you not know that A. Steffin
voted twice?" asked Byington.
Again Attorney Countryman was on
his feet. "I had a better opinion of the
District Attorney," he remarked.
Byington insisted that the question
was asked to test the credibility of the
witness, but the court ordered the jury
to disregard the question.
AH of the witnesses for the defense
have been heard but two, Frank J.
Symmes, president of the Merchants'
Association, and Thomas Atkinson, As- I
semblyman for the Thirty-ninth Dis
trict. The latter is at Sacramento, but
it is promised that Symmes will be on
hand this morning.
William T. Mulcahy, formerly an
employe of the Department of Elec
tricity, through the influence of Frank
Maestretti, gave testimony that flatly
contradicted Fairfax Wheelan. Mul
cahy swore that he saw Wyman near
the Almshouse at 4:15 p. m. on the day
of the primary election.
Under rapid-fire cross-examination by
the District Attorney, William H. Podd.
one of the election officers in the Seven
ty-third Primary Precinct of the Thir
ty-ninth District, contradicted himself
several times and at the end lapsed
into a state of forgetfulness. First he
said that he saw Wyman write his
name in the place where S. H. Mann's
name stood. Then he swore that he
did not see Wyman write. *
"Did you understand the question
asked by Attorney Countryman?"
asked Byington.
"Not thoroughly," replied Podd.
"Well, then, I ask you where did Wy
man write his name. Do you under-
Stand that?" asked Countryman.
"1 can't answer," replied Podd.
Edgar Hornbeck testified that he had
driven to the Almshouse with Mulcahy,
who left him shortly before Wyman is
alleged to have been seen in the vicin
ity. Both Hornbeck and Mulcahy de
nied that they went to the Almshouse
to do politics,
W. J. Foster produced a diagram of
the booth where Wyman is alleged to
have cast the fraudulent vote. He de
nied that E. S. Wheelan, son of the
chief witness against the defendant,
was in the booth for any length of time.
Foster declared that all but voters
were excluded.
Foster said that when he returned to
the booAh after eating his dinner a row
was in\>rogress. On being asked what
the cause was he said: "Oh, some of
the crowd wanted a democrat to vote
Republican, so I cleared them all out."
He could not say that the election of- i
fleers were not trying to persuade the
voter. "Maybe it was Fairfax Wheel
an," he added sarcastically. "He went
at It madly early In the morning."
A number of witnesses appeared at
the morning session. Frank "Tod" Mc-
Donald declared that he did not threat
en Special Policeman Joseph Doyle
with, a view of preventing him from
testifying against Wyman. He did not
â ay to Doyle, "If you give evidence;
against Wyman we will make it ap-!
pear that you told him to vote the
name of S. H. Mann."
McDonald maintains that Doyle had
been circulating stories that he (Mc-
Donald) had voted seven times at the
primaries, McDonald said he had
threatened Doyle that he would make j
trouble for him on this account only.
Wyman's wife and his father were on !
the stand in the morning. The case j
will be taken up again at 9:30 o'clock
to-day. Judge Lawlor asked at the I
close of last night's session regarding l
the time which the attorneys would re- '
quire for argument. It is expected that j
the case will go to the Jury before the
end of the week.
McGANN'S GUNSHOT WOUNDS
HAVE FATAL TERMINATION
Body Is Removed to the Morgue *nd j
Harry Smith Is Charged
With Murder.
Joseph McCann, who was shot by I
Harry Smith at Taylor and Eddy
streets on Wednesday afternoon, died
at the Central Emergency Hospital |
yesterday. Smith was charged with j
murder. McCann's body was removed
to the Morgue.
Fred Smith, brother of Harry, was
taken by Detective Ryan to police
headquarters yesterday afternoon and
qpestioned by Captain Burnett. He
detailed his meeting with McCann in i
the corner grocery and McCann's vile j
abuse of Smith's mother. Fred left i
and told Harry what McCann had said
and Harry went to look for McCann.
He denied that he either saw Harry
put a revolver In his pocket or knew
that he had one. He did not attack
McCann because McCann was too big
and strong for him. After hearing 14s j
statement he was allowed to go.
Butchers Give Annual Dinner.
The Butchers' Board of Trade gave

THIEF AT THE ST. FRANCIS.âGeorge
Shogren, who is employed at the St. Francis

ADAMS IS ALSO
TO BE ACCUSED
Grand Jury's Dragnet Will
Take Registrar in With
Election Commissioners
PROSECUTOR IS SOUGHT
F. J. Heney and H. U. Brand
enstein Decline Big Work
the Jurors Have Planned
Â«
The Grand Jury will present several
indictments to Judge Lawlor this aft
ernoon at 2 o'clock. It is expected that
District Attorney Byington will have
the accusations ready to be filed
against the Election Commissioners
and Registrar George P. Adams,
charging them with misconduct in the
appointment of election officers for the
primaries held in August last. Indict
ments are also expected in the Eppln
ger grain frauds cases.
The investigation of Registrar
Adams' connection with the alleged ir
regularities in appointment of primary
boards was not taken up by the former
Grand Jury, which returned accusa
tions against the Commissioners that
were subsequently squashed in court.
The v present inquisitorial body has
aimed its efforts at Adams particularly,
and it is thought the charge against
him will also be in shape for presenta
tion to-day.
Foreman Andrews and his colleagues
appear to be very much in earnest.
They are now seeking a special prose
cutor for the cases under investigation
involving public officials. Francis J.
Heney, who is attracting attention by
his vigorous prosecution of the land
frauds for the Federal Government,
has been asked to take hold of the work
the Grand Jury has in mind. But he
replied that his time was occupied with
the land cases and that he could not
give a helping hand.
The next appeal was made to Super
visor H. U. Brandenstein. It was pro
posed to him that he resign from the
Board of Supervisors and assume the
role of special prosecutor. It was
urged upon him that the opportunity
to gain distinction and honor such as
Joseph W. Folk has done in Missouri
was within his grasp, and furthermore
that the Grand Jury was In a position
to reward him fairly well in a financial
way out of its contingent fund. But
Brandenstein declined, and Foreman
Andrews and associates are yet on a
still hunt for a lawyer to give rein
forcement to the District Attorney.

BOLD BANDITS
ROB A HOTEL
Two Masked Men Hold Up
Proprietor and Bartender
and Afterward Loot Safe
THUGS ARE WELL ARMED
Daring Crime Is Committed
< in Business Center of the
Thriving Town of Keswick
REDDING, Jan. 12.â1n one of the
most daring holdups that has occurred
in this vicinity in many months, two
men robbed the Hotel Keswick early
this morning of $1677 in cash and $600
in checks. There is no clew to the Iden
tity of the robbers.
The Hotel Keswick is in the center
of the town of Keswick, five miles
from here. Two men of the same
height, one stout and the other thin,
both masked with pieces of a knit un
dershirt, one carrying a rifle, and the
other a revolver, entered the rear door
of the hotel saloon about 1 o'clock this
morning. J. T. Mayfield was bshind
the bar. Just as the robbers ordered
him to throw up his hands the rifle in
the hands of one of the robbers was
accidentally discharged.
J. N. Stephenson, the landlord had
Just left the office which adjoins the
barroom, to retire for the night when
he heard the rifle shot, and hurried
back only to confront the robbers.
Stephenson did not believe the robbers
were in earnest and had to be ordered
three times to hold up his hands be
fore he complied. The robbers then
took $37 from the cash register of the
saloon and searched the two men tak
ing a gold watch from each of them.
They then demanded the keys to the
safe. They had taken them from
Stephenson when they searched him
but they did not know the keys.
Stephenson told them the keys were in
his room upstairs. One of the rob
bers then started to march him to his
room after the keys. Stephenson had
hoped to overpower him when they
were in the room, but the bandit seem
ed to divine the landlord's purpose for
when the bedroom dodr was reached
he said "Oh I guess we'll try those
keys we took from you," and marched
Stephenson downstairs again. The
keys opened the safe from which was
taken $600 in checks, $140 in gold be
londing to Landlord Stephenson and
$1500 belonging to lodgers who had
money on deposit in the hotel safe.
The robbers also took all the docu
ments the safe contained. Then the
thugs marched the two men out the
front door and down the main street
of the town nearly to the smelter, then
through a barbed wire fence over the
hills to the Clara mine and half way
to Keswick station. There the men
were released after Stephenson had
asked for and received his watch.
A. C. Young, night watchman at the
Holt and Gregg lime kilns, near Ken
nett, was held up Tuesday night, and
he now believes that a rifle taken from
him was the one used at the sensa
tional holdup at the Hotel Keswick.
Young was sitting inside his cabin
Tuesday evening when he heard a noise
that attracted him to the outside.
When he turned, to re-enter the cabin
he found himself facing his own rifle
in the hands of a masked highwayman,
who had stopped in after he had step
ped out. Young handed over all the
coin he had, amounting to $5. Then
the highwayman walked away with
the rifle that ho had appropriated. As
the two men who held up and robbed
the Hotel Keswick carried one rifle, the
officers believe the weapon may be the
one stolen from Young.

STARTS FIGHT
AGAINST ADAMS
Ex-Governor Peabody of Col
orado Begins Contest for
the Chair of His Successor
NOTIFIES LEGISLATURE
Charges That Defeat Was
Accomplished by Means of
Extensive Frauds at Polls
â¢
| DENVER, Jan. 12.âNotice of former
Governor James H. Peabody's contest
against Governor Alva Adams for the
j office of Governor of Colorado was filed
j with the Legislature to-day. The com
-1 plaint sets forth the allegation that the
j plurality of 9774 votes for Adams on
I the face of the returns as finally can
j vassed was obtained by means of a
' conspiracy in Denver and several other
) counties. The Legislature is petitioned
! to open the ballot boxes from a number
of precincts in Denver, Adams, Las
AnimaÃ, Boulder and Conejos counties.
It is alleged the frauds in these pre
cincts were so extensive and varied
that It would be impossible to segre
gate the true from the false ballots and
the Legislature is asked to discard
these precincts altogether.
The Senate by a party rote seated
James B. Dick In place of Senator Rob
ert M. Born. Dick was unseated by the
Democratic majority during the contest
over the election of United States Sena
tor two years ago. The Senate mem
bership is now twenty Republicans and
thirteen Democrats, with two vacan
cies.
Senator Born refused to glvs up his
seat and was forcibly ejected by the
sergeant-at-arms.
Senator Daniel Healy, who was seat
ed two years ago in place of Jesse F.
McDonald, now Lieutenant Governor,
was also expelled by a vote of 18 to 15,
the same as in Born's case.
In a statement on the floor of the
Senate Healy declared an attempt had
been made to bribe him. He said that
Saturday during the Joint session he
was called into a private room and was
told that if he would vote for the con
firmation of Judge Goddard he need
have no fear of being unseated.
Fifteen informations charging crimes
under the election laws have been filed
by District Attorney Stidges.
John LAihoff and James Walsh,
Democratic clerks of election who
served in Precinct 5, Ward 4, at the
November election, were to-day acquit
ted of the charge of violating the Su
preme Court injunctive writ. The two
Democratic Judges, James Rowan and
James Mumford, and Policeman
Eugene Cummings were directed to ap
pear in court on Saturday when their
fate will be made known. The report
of the expert showed that seventy-six
Democratic and thirteen Republican
ballots of a total of 284 cast In this
precinct were written by the same per
son.
HAWLEY'S SUCCESSOR.

HARTFORD, Conn., Jan. 12.âFor
mer Governor Morgan G. Bulkeley

evening, to be held in Elks' Hall, by
employes of the department stores and
telephone offices of Sacramento to pro
test against the expressions of Chief of
Police Coffey, who In his official report
to the City Trustees declared that "de
partment stores and telephone offices
are kindergartens of vice for young
girls." Resolutions will be adopted de
nouncing Coffey's sweeping charge as
false and'cruel and demanding his re
moval from office.HOWELL CARADOC REES
SPENDS NIGHT IN JAIL
Arrest Follows a Threat to
. Kill an Old Friend.
ECCENTRIC NEW YORKER WHOSE PECULIAR ACTIONS SINCE HIS ARRIVAL
IN THIS CITY HAVE FINALLY RESULTED IN LANDING HIM IN THE
CITY PRISON ON A CHARGE OF THREATS AGAINST LIFE.
Howell Caradoc Rees, member of sev
eral of New York's prominent clubs
and a man who has traveled extensive
ly over the globe, spent last night in
the City Prison, charged with having
made threats against the life of a
former friend and clubmate, R. M. Gig
noux. Yesterday afternoon Gignoux,
who recently arrived from New York
and is engaged in the real estate busi
ness in the Crossley building, got a
warrant for Rees' arrest. Rees was
taken into custody by Detectives Braig
and Silver at the Clarendon Hotel, on
Post street, a few hours later.
Rees since his arrival here several
weeks ago has been cutting a lively
pace. His eccentricities became so no
ticeable that he was soon a subject of
common gossip about the hotels, and
it is said by Gignoux that, realizing
that Rees was in need of proper atten
tion, he advised the father of the young

man in New York. Apparently Howell
Rees learned of Gignoux's act, for
about ten days ago the latter received
a threatening message from Rees, and
this was later followed by further
threats. At that time Rees was stay
ing at the Palace, where one afternoon
he rushed into the office loudly an
nouncing that he was on his way to
Gignoux's apartment at the Princeton
with the intention of ending the career
of his former friend.
According to Gignoux, a few days ago
Rees sent him a letter In which he
wrote: "If you will meet me and fight
I will fill you full of holes. I will drive
you out of the city." Rees followed
this threat up by visiting Gignoux's of
fice yesterday and announcing his in
tention of killing its occupant, adding
that he had procured the services of
two men from Arizona to do the job if
he failed to accomplish it himself. Be
lieving that it was about time to dis
courage his acquaintance in his blood
thirsty plans,- Gignoux visited Judge
Mogan's court arid swore to a warrant
for Rees' arrest.
Rees has been in trouble ever since
he reached San Francisco, three weeks
ago. He was for several days a guest
at the Palace, where he and a Chinese
"personal attendant," as he was In the
habit of calling his valet, were objects
of daily comment. The New Yorker,
'although possessed of an abundant
wardrobe and seemingly determined to
have the best of everything that the
city could afford, lacked the funds to
carry him along on his rapid career.
He finally got into trouble with the
management of the Palace over his ac
count and moved to the St. Francis,
where a week's visit terminated five
days ago by his being locked out of
his rooms. He then went to the Clar
endon Hotel.
For several days Rees' Mongolian
servant has been a daily visitor at the
St. Francis and Palace, diligently
searching for his temporary master.
Tsen Cheung shares with the hotel
managers their longing for a settle
ment with the man now in jail, for it
is said by the Chinese that Rees is in
debted to him to the extent of $52. The
daily pursuit of his master over the
hard-paved streets and hotel corridors
is noticeably telling on Cheung's con
stitution and thinning him down. He is
still loyal, however, and after Rees' ar
rest yesterday the servant busied him
self carrying notes to acquaintances of
the prisoner, who sought the $500 cash
bail to insure him his .liberty. It was
not forthcoming, however.
To-day Rees' wealthy father in the
East will be advised of his son's trou
ble, and it is expected that he will find
a way of obtaining the young man's
release. A cousin of the young rhan,
Banker Roberts of San Bernardino,
vouched for Rees' account at the Pal
ace, but later declined to honor drafts.
Whether he will assist his relative out
6f his latest, trouble will be determined
to-day.
STRANGE ACTIONB Of LOUIB KNOX.âA
man giving the name of Louis Knox was
brought to the detention ward at the Central

Walsh. Knox went to the ticket office at the
ferry for a ticket to Bosten. When asked for
money he became abusive and created a scena
rio will be examined for insanity.

BT. PETERSBURG, Jan. 12.âThe ! j
Government seemingly is about to : j

tige abroad and the situation at home
necessitate the continuance of the war j
till peace with dignity is possible. Be- ;
yond this point, however, no confirma
tion exists, especially regarding the im

situation.
Emperor Nicholas is still apparently
vacillating as to whether he shall
allow Wltte full sway, in the meantime
' declining to permit Prince Sviatopolk- |
Mirsky to retire. The latter persists '
!in the view that the confidence of the
I people in the manner in which the re-
I form manifesto is to be worked out is j
vital and that this is impossible if the
work is to be left completely in the :
hands of the bureaucrats. Direct con- E
sulfation with representatives of the
cleans interested he considers essen-
I tial.
| It has now been definitely established |
! that the third section of the manifesto ,

Svlatopolk-Mirsky provided for repre- ;

" Prince Svlatopolk-Mirsky's retire- ,
; ment from thÂ« Ministry of the Interior \
j continues to be considered as only a
j matter of a short time, although there

Shanghai announcing that China has
canceled the concession of a leading
British firm for building the railroad
from Swatow to Chaochou and has re

company. This is taken as indicative
of unexpected Japanese inroads upon
British business and influence in
China.

INCURS WRATH
OF HIS MOTHER
Dr. Rutherford B. Irones of
San Francisco Weds and
May Lose an Inheritance
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES, Jan. 12.âAfter a
vain attempt to-day to prevent her son,
Dr. Rutherford B. Irones, from marry
ing Mrs. Georgia E. Dow of San Diego.
Mrs. Carrie Irones, a wealthy woman
of San Francisco, declared that she had
disinherited the young physician. Dr.
Irones says his mother is owner of the
Hotel Kenmore, on Geary street, and
other San Francisco property valued at
about $500,000. He says he does not
think she will carry out her threat to
prevent him from receiving the estate
at her death.
Ten minutes after young Irones and
Mrs. Dow had been married by Justice
Young in the Courthouse Mrs. Irones
appeared and demanded to know why a.
license had been issued to her son. The
license clerk responded that young
Irones had given his age as 27 and that
of Mrs. Dow as 25. Mrs. Dow, who was
divorced seven years- ago and who
thereupon resumed her maiden name,
is the daughter of a San Diego man
who went to the Klondike a number of
years ago in the interest of a syndicate
and is said to have cleaned up half a
million in the gold fields.
Dr. Irones and his mother came to
Los Angeles some weeks ago on a trip
around the world. He had met Mrs.
Dow previously In San Francisco and
she came here with her mother from
San Diego to wed him unknown to Mrs.
Irones. Dr. Irones claims to have been
ship surgeon on the Coptic for the Oc
cident and Oriental Steamship Com
pany, and to have acted in a confiden
tial capacity for the Chinese Govern
ment in connection with immigration
matters.

NEWS OF THE COUNTY OF ALAMEDA
ROWLAND KILLS WIFE,
THEN ENDS LIFE.
Drunkenness Leads
to Frightful
Tragedy.
ShootsSpouse,Then
Cuts Own Throat
With Razor.
OAKLAND, Jan. 12âGeorge H. Row
land, a Southern Pacific Company
switchman, this afternoon shot and
killed his wife, tried to kill his son
Edward, seventeen years old, when the
boy tried to save his stepmother, and
completed the domestic tragedy by
nearly severing his own head from his
body with a razor.
The murder and suicide occurred in
the kitchen of. the Rowland residence,
918 Center street, at 2:45 o'clock. Row
land had been drinking heavily and was
enraged over Mr*., Rowland's decision
to leave him. ,
Gathered ii} the parlor shortly before
the shooting were Mr. and Mrs. Row
land, the boy Edward and Mrs. Ethel
Day and Mrs. Frank W. Sonderleiter,
daughters of Mrs. Rowland. The hus
band and wife had returned from a
trip to San Francisco to arrange the
terms of property settlement, prelim-'
inary to the carrying out of an agree
ment to separate. The folks had been
talking about the family differences,
when Rowland suddenly left the room.
Soon afterward he called to his wife,
asking her to go into the kitchen. The
boy, who is Rowland's son by a for
mer marriage, warned his stepmother
not to have. He feared something
might occur, because his father had
shown signs of ugliness.
But Mrs. Rowland went and had
barely closed the door, when the others
heard two pistol shots. Young Row
land ran to the kitchen and saw his
stepmother lying on the floor. The
father was brandishing a pistol. The
boy grabbed a chair and smashed it
at his father, knocking the weapon out
of his hand. The young man tried to
get the pistol, but his father seized it
and fired a shot at the boy, who rushed
out to alarm his stepsisters. He had
opened the front door to let them out
into the street when a bullet passed
between his arm and body.
PREPARES FOR DEED.
The father turned away and went
to a pantry off the kitchen, where he
laid the pistol on a shelf. Then he took
his razor, stepped out on the back
porch and facing a small looking
glass on the wall, slashed his throat
deeply. He staggered back to where
his wife's body lay and died with one
arm around her neck. Mrs. Rowland
was shot once through the head.
The women went to neighbors as
young Rowland summoned the police.
Captain of Police Wilson arrived and
found the house locked. Young Rowland
was in a wildly excited state outside ihe
house in the hands of friends. Captain
Wilson entered the house and found
the bodies. The floor, doors and table
were covered with blood, the trail
showing the movements of Rowland.
The pistol, and razor were all evidence
of the gory crime. On the kitchen
table were the remains of a half-fin
ished meal and a large tin box that
contained the family private papers.
A deed, blood-spattered, lay opened on
the table as if Rowland had been exam,
lnlng the paper shortly before he made
up his mind to end the domestic differ
ences.
As soon as Captain of Police Wil
" son entered the house he ran to the
kitchen and then sent for Dr. W. K.
Sanborn, who examined the bodies,
pronouncing the man and the woman
dead. Rowland's pistol, still warm
but empty, was found on the pantry
shelf. Two cartridges were found on
the kitchen floor* One of the bullets
plowed through the side of the house
and lodged in the side of the next
door dwelling. The police took charge
and sent for the Coroner, who re
moved the bodies, to the Morgue.
LIQUOR THE CAUSE.
Young Rowland declared that
liquor was at the bottom of the fath
er's crime. There had been quarrels
over his drinking an* Mrs. Rowland
had told him that she could no longer
bear to live with him. After it had
â  been arranged they should part Row
land and his wife decided to settle the
property Interests amicably. The hus
band owned the two-story dwelling
which was their home, and it was In
tended he should deed that to his
wife. They made the trip to San
Francisco, but found they did not
have the documents necessary to make
certain transfers that were to be pre
pared. It was on their return that the
stepchildren met the couple to talk
over matters.
None of them had complaint to
make other than that Rowland- in his
cups was disagreeable toward his wife.
Jtowland, after the shooting!
said he had a fear of something
wrong, but did not suspect his father
would resort to such a desperate deed.
Nine years ago Rowland married
the woman whom he killed. She was
then the widow of Thomas H. Irwin.
Mrs. Rowland's maiden name was I
Florence R. Mclntyre. She was 42
years old. heing twenty-five years
younger than Rowland. He had been
in the Southern Pacific Company's
employ for thirty years, having come
to Oakland from Canada. *
The children are Edward Rowland,
a Southern Pacific Company employe;
Mrs. Ethel Day, wife of Fred Day,

who resided at the Rowland home;
Mrs. Frank W. Sonderleiter, wife of

women are daughters of Mrs. Row

Fast Freight in Collision
LAS VEGAS, N. M., Jan. 12.âThree
persons were killed, two fatally in
jured and several others more or less
painfully hurt in a collision to-day be
tween the eastbound California Limited
on the Santa Fe road and w freight
train. The accident occurred about
thirty miles south of Raton and was
due to the failure of the freight crew
to observe orders giving the limited
right of way. The wreck was the
worst in the history of this division
and a number of trains were held up
until midnight pending the clearing of
the wreckage. The dead:

The injured are in the hospital.
The trains met on a long hill in a
dense fog. The passenger, which had
the right of way over the freight, was
traveling forty miles an hour. The
freight was descending the Incline and
was also making fast time in an ef
fort to reach Tipton before the limited
arrived. The impact of the two trains
was terrific and wreckage from the
two engines, baggage and express cars
and freight cars was hurled high in
the air.
The limited had the right of way
over the freight, which was an ex
tra, but the freight crew thought they
had time%to reach Tipton ahead of the
other train.
The passenger train was heavily
laden and the occupants of the cars
were hurled from their seats and
berths with great violence. A ma
jority of them sustained bruises by be
ing thrown against the sides of the
ci.rs and the seats.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, JANUARY 13, 1905.
STRONG WORDS
OF CATTLEMAN
President of the National
Livestock Association Is
sues Challenge From Chair
DENVER, Jdn. 12.â"The man who
has Imputed motives of dishonor to
your president is a liar, an absolute
and unqualified liar, and the chair is
| able to substantiate it physically or
i otherwise."
This was the declaration of Presi
j dent Frank J. Hagenbarth of the Na
tional Livestock Association in a
speech made to-day to the opposition.
His words alluded to alleged state
ments that he had been overzealous
in his efforts to obtain for the rail
roads representation in the governing
body of the Livestock Association.
At the morning session of the asso
ciation some sharp criticisms of the
president were made by a number of
the delegates, who declared that he
was paying too much attention to the
committee meeting in which the plan
of reorganization was being consid
ered, and too little to the meetings of
the convention. At the afternoon ses
sion the president appeared in person
Ito reply to his critics. He declared in
! the commencement of his remarks
| that he had been insulted by delegates
, who had impugned his motives, and
that he wished to take a few minutes
|on a question of personal privilege.
He denied that he had been actuated
I by any idea but the good of the asso
i ciation; that he had no personal inter
est in the admission of any group of
men into the membership of the Live
stock Association/ and then made the
declaration given above.
At the afternoon session, when
President Hagenbarth had concluded
his speech, S. H. Cowan of Fort
( Worth, Tex., called up the order made
at the morning session, which directed
the organization committee to report
at 1:30 this afternoon or be discharged
| from further service.
President Hagenbarth asked him to
i delay his motion to bring in the com
mittee, as it was about ready to re
port, but it would need until to-mor
row to finish its work.
The rollcalL was finally had after
considerable delay.

FINDS A FLAW
IN ORDINANCE
License Law of Berkeley Is
Unconstitutional Accord
ing to the Town Attorney
CITY'S BAD POSITION
Business Can Be Conducted
Without Paying Tax to
the Municipal Government
Berkeley Office San Francisco Call,
2148 Center Street, Jan. 12.
As the result of court and attorney's
act to-day tire town of Berkeley finds
itself in the unique position of being
without a license law under which its
officers may operate to produce "venue
for the government.
Town Attorney Hayne declared In
Justice Edgar's court this morning,
during the trial of H. P. Carlson, a
peddler arrested for doing business
without a license, that the license ordi
nance of Berkeley was unconstitutional
and void. He based his opiniolk on the
fact that the ordinance permitted the
Town Trustees to grant free licenses.
This he deemed to be "class legisla
tion," making improper discrimination
possible, and nullifying the entire ordi
nance.
Judge S. P. Hall of the Superior
Court of this county has confirmed
Town Attorney Hayne's view of the
ordinance, Hayne said, and so the
Town Attorney moved that the pris*
oner, Carlson, be discharged. Justice
Edgar assented and Carlson left the
courtroom. He was arrested for a sim
ilar offense several month& ago and
convicted, but on appeal Judge Ells
worth found the complaint defective
and Carlson thus escaped.
By the act of Justice Edgar and At
torney Hayne to-day the town is de
prived of any measure under which
licenses may be collected. Peddlers,
banks, stables, laundries or corpora
tions may operate without paying until
a new license ordinance is adopted. The
ordinance which has been in force was
adopted on June 22, 1903.
SOCIETY WOULD
RELIEVE HOME
OF A DEFENDER
BY ZOE GREEN RADCLIFFE.
OAKLAND. Jan. 12.â"And the greatest of
these is charity." So said one who also bade
us love our neighbor as ourself. and it was
in the name of the greatest of all the vlrtuee
that Mrs. Maxwell Taft threw open the doors
of her home to the public to-day to relieve
another home recently made desolate. The
beneficiary of the tea and musicals which
society has been eagerly anticipating is Mrs.
George Brown, wife of the policeman who
met death a few weeks ago while in the dis
charge of his duty.
Actuated no doubt by the same sweet spirit
of helpfulness and sympathy that prompted
the hostess the smart set attended the tea
in numbers that poured in and overflowed the
charming little residence on Monteeito avenue
Mrs. Bruce Haven presided at the door and
besides the silver quarters that piled up before
her there were scores of tiny envelopes with
generous donations. It is safe to predict that
over $200 will be netted through the kindly
efforts of Mrs. Taft and her friends.
Some good music was heard during the
afternoon. Miss Kdith Wallace being a singer
new to most of us, but as she sings with ex
cellent taste and style will no doubt be called
upon frequently in the future.
The double trio, composed of six of our
most popular society maids, was a delightful
surprise to everybody present. They have
been practicing together for two or three
weeks only, but they sang several numbers
to-day in a real musicianly " manner. The
sextet of girls Includes Miss May Coogan,
Miss Marion Smith, Miss Carolyn Oliver, Miss
Cordelia Bishop, Miss Crissle Taft and Miss
Anita Oliver. .They pleased the eye as well
as the ear while they sang, for they made
a very pretty picture in their gowns of deli
cate tints.
Miss Winifred June Morgan, whose fine work
Is too well known to need comment, con
tributed a violin solo and Miss May Coogan's
sweet voice was heard in a solo. Mrs. Max
Taft and Miss Pauline Collins accompanied
the soloists.
One of the most stunning gowns at the tea
was worn by the dainty little hostess, who
looked very girlish in a pale blue gown of
some soft silk, made with a full skirt and
bodice and regular leg of mutton sleeves. The
young ladies in her receiving party were, in
their dainty gowns, a veritable "rosebud gar
den of girls." The six young girls in the
sextet assisted in receiving, and others also In
the party were Miss Georgie Cops, Miss Wal
lace, Miss Edith Selby. Miss Edith Gaskill.
Among those who attended to the tea were:
Miss Florlnne Brown, Mrs. Lillian Brown

$10,000 belonging to the estate of their
father, the late Jose Leveira of San
Leandro, Martin Leveira has had his
brother, George, a resident of Antioch,

done with the money. The quarrel
between the brothers began with a
row between the parents, in which the
children took sides.
Mary Leveira, the mother and wife,
sued Jose for a divorce on the ground
of cruelty. While the suit was pend
ing her husband, rather than face the
charges, converted what property he
could readily dispose of into cash
and left the country. It was sup

his death recently at Antioch revealed
his hiding place, where he had been
harbored by his son George. The
family is now endeavoring to get its
share of the money the old man took

FORFEITS LOVE
OF HIS FAMILY
Children Look Upon James
C. Fink as Stranger and
Spouse Does Not Want Him
FATHER'S PLACE IS LOST
Fails in Attempt to Re-enter
Home Circle and Wife
Gets a Decree of Divorce
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1016 Broadway, Jan. 12.
When James C. Fink of Livermor*.
returned from years of wandering in
Australia no fatted calf was killed nor
did he get the greeting he expected
from wife and children. On the con
trary, he had ceased to be missed and
his attempt to resume his position at
the head of his family was regarded
as an intrusion. A divorce action was
begun by Mrs. Anna M. Fink, which
terminated in her obtaining a decree
to-day on the ground of desertion and
failure to provide.
The Finks lived at Livermore and
times were prosperous, but mismanage
ment made shipwreck of their fortunes
and when things were at their worst
Fink v -nt to Australia without notify
ing his family of his intended departure
until the day he was to sail. After ar
riving at Australia he wrote once and
asked his wife to Bend him a ticket on
which to return, but she replied to him
that she had no money. Several years
went by and a few months ago Fink
reappeared at the old home. *
Work and hardship had made Its im
press upon the wife. The iove for the
man who was once her husband had
gone. The children were strangers to
him and his advent was the occasion of
a disarrangement of the family routine.
He was told there was no place for him
in the home he had deserted. Judge
Melvin took this view of the matter
and granted Mrs. Fink an interlocutory
decree.
Marion Sheridan got an interlocutory
decree of divorce from Michael Sheri
dan, a marine engineer, to-day and
she also obtained the custody of their
four children. By arrangement she is
to receive $20 a month alimony, $120
cash in bank and some lots In Seattle.
CO-EDS' TRICK
CAST IN SHADE
Professor Moses Sutlers From
Worse Than Cherry Blos
som Theft by Students
Berkeley Office San Francisco Call,
2148 Center Street, Jan. 12.
Contributions to the literature In
spired by the famous axiom regarding
the folly of locking the stable door
after the horse has been stolen are now
expected from Professor Bernard
Moses, the distinguished authority on
international law and political history
and former Philippine Commissioner.
His favorite horse has been stolen.
Professor Moses reported to Marshal
Kerns this morning the dlappearance
of a pet saddle horse from the stable at
the Moses place, on College avenue, ad
joining the university campus. The ani
mal is said never to have strayed from
home, and so Professor Moses credited
his loss to the machination of one or
more of the gang of law-breakers that
has infested the university town since
the racing season opened.
It was Professor Moses who suffered
loss at the hands of the university co
eds last year, when the maidens
thoughtfully removed, as he alleged,
quantities of cherry blossoms and other
foliage from his place on College ave
nue. His remarks to the co-eds, made
in classroom hours, created a sensa
tion, though it was not supposed that
they would be taken so seriously as
they were. Some affected to see a joke
in the matter, attributing the cherry
blossom thefts to the gay spirits of
sorority girls, who had used the cherry
blossoms to decorate their rooms for a
tea, to which Professor Moses had been
bidden. It has been suggested that the
horse-stealing episode, reported to the
police by the professor to-day, may be
another prank of the buoyant col
legians, but this Professor Moses is
loth to believe.
Open house is now being kept at the
Moses stable, the padlock being in dis
use, as heretofore, in the hope that
conscience-stricken persons may drivt
the stolen or strayed animal back into
the Moses barnyard.

Attorney's Attempt to Take
Records of Peyton Chem

WALLACE THWARTS HIM
Ponder Trust's Represen
tatives Worsted in Fistic
Battle in Mills Building
Attorney Oscar Sutro. representing
the DuPont Powder Company of New
York, was forcibly thrown from the of
fices of the Peyton Chemical Company
yesterday by Secretary John P. Wal
lace after Sutro had tried to carry off
the latter company's stock record.
The ruse to get the books was a
time-worn one, but the aiertness of
Secretary Wallace prevented the rep
resentatives of the powder trust from
accomplishing their end. Frank Turner,
auditor of the California Powder Com
pany, a tributary of the DuPont con
cern, in oompany with Attorney Sutro
called at the Chemical Company's of
fices in the Mills building shortly after
2 o'clock p. m. Turner informed Wal
lace that he wanted to sign for some
stock. Ten shares were agreed upon,
and Turner affixed his signature to the
stock book of the company. This done
Sutro quietly picked up the book and
started for the door. Wallace detected
his scheme, and bounding over an in
tervening desk grabbed him just as he
was on the threshold.
"Give me that book," cried Wallace.
"Not till I've seen the contents," re
torted the attorney.
A struggle ensued. Wallace is mus
cular and wrested the book from Su
tro. In the scuffle the attorney's hands
came in forcible contact with the door,
and the knuckles were cut. Turner took
no part in the fight, but acted as a
peaceable spectator. After he had se
cured the coveted book Wallace seized
Sutro and ejected him from the offices.
. In speaking of the trouble Wallace
said: "Sutro tried to remove the book,
and I simply took it away from him
and threw him out. I had anticipated
something of the sort. The suit brought
by the DuPont people In an endeavor
to see the books of our company has
been thrown from Superior Judge Ker
r.iKan's court and that of Circuit Judge
Morrow. Their suit resulted from that
filed by us last June, in which we sued
for $500,000 for breach of contract. The
DuPont trust has been trying to get
control of our company for some time.
II owns about 45 per cent of the stock,
which is held in the names of dummy
stockholders. It has a revised suit on
the same lines, which comes up in
Judge Lawlor* s court to-morrow morn-
Ins:. We have held out against the
i rust up to now, and what it will do in
the future to get control of our com
pany remains to be seen."

POLICEMAN DONS
QUEER DISGUISE
AND BUYS A POOL
S. HOLMES ECLIPSED
Violator of Ordinance Cheerfully
Sells Convicting Evidence.
In accordance with his chieftain's
behest to all patrolmen, Policeman
Cornelius kept a weather eye open
for the detection of violators of the
measure prohibiting the selling of
pools on horse races and soon was re
warded by finding evidence ample to
justify belief that one Fred Jones was
holding the ordinance in slight es
teem. In the office of a livery stable
on California street, near to Polk, Mr.
Jones was in daily habit of receiving
and transacting business with persons
whose only apparent interest in horse
flesh consisted of the effect that the
results of certain speed contests at
Emeryville would have upon their
pocket books. Having satisfied him
self on this point, the patrolman's
next move was to catch Mr. Jones In
the act of pool selling and also to ob
tain the material evidence necessary
to convict him of the offense. How
well he succeeded in acomplishing
both those objects was demonstrated
by his appearance yesterday before
Police Judge Mogan as complaining
witness against Mr. Jones and his
production of a pool ticket which he
had purchased from the defendant.
Among: the men whom Cornelius
had noticed at various times in con
verse with Mr. Jones were several at
taches of a nearby meat market, and
it was the sight of one of them emerg
ing from the stable with the pleased
smile of a winner that afforded the
idea that resulted in the coup. Re
moving his coat and donning a butch
er's blouse and cap, besides equipping
himself with a leg of lamb, several
dozen yards of welnerwurst and other
wares of his pretended calling the po
liceman hastily entered the stable of
fice and hurriedly said: "Gimme Ba
ker at the odds, quick!" Mr. Jones
smiled blandly as he filled the order
and gave his customer a ticket en
titling him to draw $11 in return for
the $5 deposited if a horse named Ba
ker should win a race that day at
Oakland. No sooner was the deal
completed than the pseudo butcher
cast off his disguise and exclaimed:
"Behold, I'm an officer and you're
pinched!"
It was a dramatic moment. Even
the policeman's recountal of it thrilled
the court.
"Your work," quoth the Judge, ad
miringly, "was worthy of What-d'ye
call-um Holmes."
Mr. Jones will attempt a defense to
day.

It was in the home of the Small

Mr. Roth. He went there with intent

Mr. Roth had an attorney, of course,
and prior to the appearance of Mrs.

the bench that she had not been in

that effect having been given to him
by Mr. Roth. He withdrew the asser
tion, however, when Mrs. Smallman ap

discolored and bruised in spots. Her
delay in arriving was explained by the
fact that she had just come from St.

had sewed up her wounds, four stitches
being required to close one incision
made by Mr. Roth's monkeywrench.

Italian Grand Opera Com
pany at Tivoli Discloses
Unexpected Musical Worth
"LA TOSCA" WELL SUNG
Though Below First Night's
Triumph Work of Singers
and Orchestra Is Applauded
"La Tosca" last evening brought out
j the dramatic voices of the Italian
Grand Opera Company at the Tivoli. It
was the second night of the season, and
there was a kind of seccmd-night feel
! ing generally about things. Not that
! there is any doubt of the qtality of the
| people gathered together at the Tivoli,
j only neither they nor the audience were
iat their best. One wonders if the small
j r size of the house as compared with
; that of the *rst night was a comment
; upon the opera. The music-melo-
drama was a success here from the
first excellent performance of it given
under Mr. Steindorff, but the fact re
mains that the audience last evening
was by a third less than on the first
night.
Nor was the performance by much on
the first night's level, though it cleared
up well in the last act. Even a Pollac
co proved himself unable to whip
modern music-drama into shape in one
rehearsal. The score is most intricate
and difficult, and there were many
loose ends. This was particularly the
case with the orchestral portion, yet
in its many fine moments one remem
bered to be glad of the tonal body and
beauty afforded by the large organiza
tion. But even the principals wereâ
tired, perhapsânot quite sure of their
parts.
Signorina Berlendi is destined to be
come a great favorite here or I mis
take. She is an extremely pretty
young women, an actress of charm and
power and possessed of a big, brilliant
dramatic soprano voice. Perhaps In
the comedy phase of the character of
Floria Tosca she showed herself most
capable, but she also depicted convinc
ingly the horror of La Tosca when in
the meshes of Scarpia and the emotions
evoked by her murder of the tyrant.
There is very much to be expected from
Signorina Berlendi and to-morrow
afternoon, as last night, a La Tosca
of real thrill.
La Puma looked like Dr. Johnson,
j but I do not feel inclined therefore to
play the Boswell to his Scarpia. Per
haps it was because he acted it in the
sedate and stolid fashion that might
have been expected from the "immor
tal lexicographer!" Yet, so greatly has
report -of this company fallen below
its desert that I am wondering If It
Is I or Signor La Puma who was out
of mood last evening. But one has seen
Coquelin's stab at the same part, and
after that La Puma can afford his.
To-night the barytone will sing
Figaro In "The Barber," which will
probab!y y prove La Puma's opportunity.
As to voice, it's a beauty. Smooth,
splendidly flexible, resonant, powerful,
we are going to hear some wonderful
things from the singer when, as a
voice, he gets his chance.
Colli, first billed as Cavaradossl, did
not appear, but in Signor Frosini was
discovered an exponent of the part who
commanded large admiration. Signor
Frosini, though quite apparently feel
ing his wav in the earlier scenes, later
developed a dramatic intensity, a
vocal power and beauty, that, with
Signorina Berlendi, carried the situa
tions almost killed by La Puma. Fro
sini will share dramatic honors with
Berlendi this season. The singers
were repeatedly called out after the
final curtain. Of the rest of the cast
Signor Cervi in the sacristan's part ren
dered good service.

MAKE ANNUAL REPORTS
Owing to Increasing De
mands Mrs. Harrington Ad
vises Extension of Building
The twenty-ninth annual meeting of
the Hospital for Children and Training
School for Nurses was held yesterday
at the institution, Mrs. W. B. Harring
ton, president, in the chair.
The president's report showed that
! the work of the year just ended had
i confirmed and strengthened the opin
j ion she had expressed in her last an
nual address regarding the necessity of
| replacing the main building by
a modern structure. The surprising
growth of the city of late years had so
widened the field expected to be cov
ered that the association found itself
hampered and quite unable with its
| present facilities to do Justice to the
j increasing calls. To effect such an lm
| provement would require a large sum
I and the question how it shall be raised
j demanded careful consideration. Eight
een years ago, Mrs. Harrington said,
when funds and materials were ob
tained from the public spirited citizens
of San Francisco for the erection of the
present building, the onerous task fell
mainly upon the board of trustees.
Mrs. Harrington said the present board
would render all the aid In Its power
toward the accomplishment of the
worthy object.
RECEIVE FREE TREATMNT.
Mrs. C. Edward Holmes, recording
secretary, reported that 1200 patients
had been cared for in 1804, of whom 494
were women and 706 children, making
an average of 19 adults and 84 children
each day in the year. Of this number
thirty-three children and four adults
daily were absolutely free patients and
a large portion of the remainder paid
greatly reduced charges.
Two new memorial beds were placed
during the year, the "Agnes" by Mrs.
Mary Haileck Foote and the "Phoebe
Lowenthal," by Robert Hochstadter.
In recognition of Charles R. Bishop's
generosity to the hospital a special
room has been named m his honor.
The record of the Pacific Dispensary,
741 Brannan street, a branch of the
hospital, shows 3110 patients treated
during the year, 3540 prescriptions
filled, 330 doctors* "out visits" and 401
nurses' "out visits"; obstetrical cases,
18; poor families helped, 38, and cases
sent from the dispensary to the hos
pital, 24.
Mrs. L. L. Dunbar, the treasurer, re
ported that the hospital receipts for the
year were $62,499 25, of which $6000 was
a bequest from Mrs. Emily Pope, paid
Into the endowment fund. Disburse
ments amounted to $63,724 11. The bal
ance on hand January 1, 1905, was
$6181 71, with bills unpaid for October,
November and December amounting to
1 $9422 86.
Mrs. Dunbar announced that the
"donation day" appeal at Christmas
brought in $4253.
Dr. H. T. Crabtree, resident physi
cian, read a report in behalf of the
medical staff and laboratory service.
SOCIETY FOLKS ACTIVE.
Mrs. John F. Merrill's report of the
three auxiliaries of the hospital showed
that many young society women and
children of well-to-do parents were
taking an active part in the hospital's
welfare.
The election of officers resulted as fol
lows:
President. Mrs. W. B. Harrington; vice
presidents, Mrs. William Hardy. Mrs. J. F.
Merrill; recording secretary, Mrs. C. E.
Holmes; corresponding secretary. Mrs. J. L.

PUBLICATION OFFICE THIRD AND MARKET STREETS, BAN FRANCISCO j
FRIDAY JANUARY lj, 1905
THE SENATORIAL ELECTION.
THE first contention of The Call is won in the election of a Sen
ator from Southern California. The political and practical pro
priety of this was so manifest that other combinations, however
strong, were compelled to yield to it. The proper ambitions -and
material interests of that great section of our State .have been heard,
heeded and satisfied. It is true also that Southern California had
a free hand in making her own choice in selecting the man deemed
fittest to represent her in the Senate.
That part of the State set a high mark when Stephen M. White
was chosen. Party affiliation and partisan considerations put aside,
he was a great Senator, and in disinterested service, as a represen
tative of the popular aspirations and in his fine training and consum
mate ability, he was a conspicuous credit to the State. If the Re
publicans of Southern California have made a choice of as high merit
and capacity, then they have done well. But White had one fault;
he was culpable of one error in policy that reacted upon his party
and himself, to the injury of both. When a man enters public life,
as a party man, he must observe the somewhat hard and fast rules
of the game. If his party administration is in power, it is there as
the leader, and discipline and the future welfare of the party require
that the leader be followed. To this view of his Senatorial obligation
White was rebellious. He declared for Senatorial individuality as
against his own administration, and after that what happened hap
pened and is history.
Mr. Cleveland had been elected by a significant majority. States
long Republican shifted their political moorings and followed him.
His party had a majority in the House and Senate and saw visions
and dreamed dreams of a return of that long lease of power which
it enjoyed between 1801 and 1861. To all political observers and
experts the realization of these dreams and visions seemed certain.
Mr. Cleveland was an exceptionally strong man. His career was
the romance of American politics. His conception of right was lofty
and he was such a master of statement that his utterance of party
principle was unrivaled even by that of Jefferson. Yet all of these
high expectations came to naught. These exalted hopes ended in
despair. The popular confidence so fully given was as completely
withdrawn and the whole fabric fell in clattering ruin. The party
refused to lead or be led. It fell into disorder and wandered, wound
ing itself, like the man among the tombs.
This history is recent and it is instructive. Those that never
rise cannot fall. Only the exalted can be cast down. The election
of a Senator is primarily of interest to the successful man. It grat
ifies the pride of his friends. Were this all, and were there no fur
ther significance in it, the rest of the people could afford to be indif
ferent. But this is not all. Upon the election of a single Senator
may depend the greatest of consequences. They may involve na
tional supremacy by involving party domination. They may run far
into the future, affecting the welfare of the people at home and the
respect in which the Government is held abroad. Southern Califor
nia exults now, as is her right, and the rest of the State is gratified
that the needs of physical and political and commercial geography
have been recognized. All this may be dismissed, and remembered
only in the pleasure that it caused. But after that arise more serious
considerations, far reaching in their results.
The country has just given to a Republican President a ma
jority of 2,500,000. That is a majority of the whole people nearly
equal to the whole population at the period of the revolution. That
majority exceeds the total vote given to Lincoln by more than
750,000. It is not 500,000 less than the total vote of Grant in 1868.
It means something. It is an indorsement of party policies as rep
resented by the President. California gave to it her vote of 116,000.
Just now there are visions of perpetuity of party power. There are
dreams of supremacy equal to that which stretched across the last
century from Jefferson to Buchanan. The President has done his
part to concrete these dreams into fact and weave them into history.
Does it remain to be seen whether California has followed her in
dorsement of the President with her support of his policies? Or is it
true that in a delirium California Republicanism knows not the
sound of its own voice?
These are the sober and sobering considerations that stretch far
beyond the exultation of present success. The people are with the
President. Are they on guard, or do they sleep? A wise Californian
said once that those who need the instruction of results must wait
for the results. So it will be now. We must wait for results to see
whether in the selection of a Southern California Senator history is
to repeat itself, and we are to witness the assertion of an individ
uality, rebellious to discipline and refusing to lead or to follow. The
time has gone by when enthusiasm and exultation fill the whole
field of thought that is around the choice of a Senator. If the people
cannot win their way behind the President through the party, they
will try to win it by a reaction that may be like the breaking of the
seals that hold the pestilence.
The responsibility of this State cannot be avoided. It cannot be
shifted. It cannot be lost in the shouting. It sits unsleeping upon
the public conscience. The reckoning is not uncertain. It will be
approval or disapproval. It will condemn or it will exalt. We say
these things for the purpose of suggestion, hoping that no warning
is needed, and that there is nowhere any purpose that needs to be
warned. Let every eye be upon the pendulum of politics, and let all
witness how slight the impulse oj/its backward swing.
IN his biennial message to the Legislature Governor Pardee ad
vises an appropriation for specific educational interests which
affects directly the whole agricultural interests of the State. His
recommendation is that there be added to the equipment of the agri
cultural college of the State University an experiment farm of suffi
cient dimensions to insure the broadest practice and so situated as
to be typical of the largest agricultural areas. Until this adjunct to
the agricultural courses at Berkeley is provided, says the Governor,
the full efficiency of the school cannot be attained.
At first sight it may appear to the layman in things agricultural
that the possession of a farm, at a distance from the university site
and devoted to the practical instruction of university students, is not
a necessity. A brief survey of the conditions now obtaining at the
State agricultural school must, however, demonstrate the worth of
the Governor's idea. At present the student of liorticulture at
Berkeley learns all he knows about irrigation, drainage of orchards,
the/planting and pruning of trees, etc., from textbooks and charts
hung on the wall of his recitation room. The one who wishes to
perfect himself in the science of stock raising can only supplement
his book knowledge by a limited study of a small herd kept in the
stock barn back of the college campus. Theory monopolizes the
whole curriculum; practice comes with a rude shock after the stu
dent's graduation.
Among agricultural colleges of the East those achieving the
highest results have supplemented their teaching of theory by the
co-ordination of practice supplied by university farms. The farm
is made the laboratory of the agricultural courses just as the tech
nical courses in science have each their department of experimenta
tion. California's great wealth that comes from the soil demands that
in nothing facilitating the development of her resources should there
be any lagging behind Eastern competitors. Governor Pardee's
recommendation in behalf of the agricultural college should com
mend itself to the Legislature.
Forgetful of what he owe* to the United States, he haÂ» insulted and In
jured Its citizens. Under the circumstances the American Government will
be Justified in notifying President Castro that he must play the game fairlyâ
that his dishonest attempts to delay the payment of Just debts must stop.â

A COLLEGE FARM.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, JANUARY 13, 1905.
FOUR DAYS
OUR acquaintance began in a
manner most unique.
High up orj the canyon wall
was a rock, shaded by a live
oak. For a month it had been
my custom to sit upon this rock
through the warmest part of the day
sketching. I had established posses
sion by right of pre-emption.
So it came in the nature of a shock
when I climbed to my usual vantage
; point and found, ensconced in my fav
i orite position on my rock a girl.
,*I was indignant, also disappointed. I
felt much as Izaak Walton might
have felt when he found an interloper
fishing his favorite pool. This was a
most presumptuous young person.
"Ahem!" remarked.
She half turned and made a slight
bow.
"The view is something tremendous
from here," I observed further.
"Very!" she agreed.
"I come here every day," I said as
I sat down conventionally near. "I
have done bo for a month."
"Oh! Perhaps you would rather
Iâ"
"By no means!" I exclaimed. "The
view is much betterâ '*
She froze me. Then she laughed. We
were friends by the divine instinct
which tells unerringly whom we are
going to like or hate.
I was glad she had Jumped my claim.
For she was very pretty and her eyes
were the kind that sends a thrill
through your whole being and you
wonder if you are going to live
through it.
c â¢ a â¢
It was three days after.
"Why didn't you wait for me?" I
asked as I climbed over the rock and
threw myself down beside her.
She opened her brown eyes wide in a
wonderful assumption of surprise.
"How did I know you were com
ing?" she asked.
I was amazed at the nerve of her. As
though I couldV have kept away. As
though the combined police forces of
two continents could have kept me
away. This girl must be disciplined.
"Of course you know," I said con
fidently.
She looked at me and I felt my heart
turn to water. Still I persisted, where
a wise man would have turned the
conversation swiftly to the weather or
the view. "You knew I'd been com
ing every day for a month. You knew
I usually came up about this time. You
knew âthen why didn't you allow me
to accompany youâ"
She rose. "I'm not coming any
more," she said.
I sprang to my feet in fright.
"Don't!" I pleaded. "I want you to
stay! Iâ"
She kept her face averted, though I
could see that her cheeks were hot and
; flushed. "Good-by," she said, and was
â¢ gone.
The sun suddenly turned to ink.
Where a moment before had been a
bright scene spreading away below me
was a howling wilderness and I was
tempted to jump off the rock and butt
my empty head against the riverbed
three hundred feet below. I longed to
be a boy again that I might go down
and fight the first kid I ran across.
This was the second day.
â¢ â¢*â¢â¢â¢â¢â¢
The next Saturday night there was a
quiet dance in -the assembly room of
this famous resort between the high
walls of the Matilija Canyon. I saw
my chance to redeem myself. I would
dance with her and make my peace
while she was so close she would be
compelled to listen, for all the week
she had seemed unaware of my exist
ence.
It was an informal affair l âa country
dance, sans cards and ceremony. I ap
proached the group where Miss Wins
ton was chatting brightly with a golf
stocking Englishman and a Boston
magnate. Miss Winstone saw me com
: ingâI know she did. She looked
through and beyondâfar beyond me. I
felt like a perambulating piece of thin
glass which a breath of hers might
shatter.
I stopped suddenly. Of course that j
was it! We had not been properly |
'"presented." What a chump I was. I
â ought diligently for Bobby Jelinski, !
who knew everybody. I didn't find j
him. The band struck up and I saw
her go gliding away with the English
man â bis golf stockings flashing j
among the dancers like two variegated |
comets running amuck along the heav- j
ens of a bright night.
And this was my luck all through
the evening. Try as I would, I got no I
dance from her. I managed a few |
words while she was waiting for her
mother, who was struggling with a I
Mexican mantilla. I gathered that it
was a fine night and that she had en- j
joyed her dance immensely and yes,
California moonlight was far superior !
to anything she had ever seenâand
then she was gone, with the English
man pompously escorting her.
"What's the matter with you. any- !
way?" demanded Bobby Jelinski, who
at the eleventh hour had presented '-.
me.
"Bobby," I said savagely, "will you
kindly go to blazes a few timesâand
stay there!"

LOWELL O. REESE
was drawing to a close. I had made
no progress. Miss Winston met me on
the ground of easy comradeship,
which obtained at the. springs, where
everybody was dependent upon every
body else for companionship and en
tertainment, but the sweet familiarity
which had come so naturally those
first three days upon the rock seemed,
viewed in the light of the present sit
uation, as a thing I must have
dreamed aboutâbut which never
could have been.
And still the Englishman persisted.
I had come down from the rock and
was wandering aimlessly among the
live oaks on the opposite side of the
canybn, when, happening to glance
across, I saw the flutter of a skirt on
the trail leading up to the rock. I drew
out my field glasses and trained them
on the figure ascending the familiar
trail. It was she! I watched her
climbing with furtive downward
glances. The mystery was solved at
last. Regularly all these unhappy
days I* had been missing her. She
must have been going up there all
these days, waiting always for me to
come down.
Blind rage filled my heart. I would
go ud there and face her with her
guilt! I would reproach her and make
her see the enormity of her offense.
(All this time I was plunging across
the canyon and up the trail.) I would
show her just how far she could go in
breaking a loving heart. I wouldâ
Then as I found I was nearly half
way ud the trail I lost my nerve and
decided to wait and meet her casually
as she came down. I was tired, any
way. I sat down In the shadow of a
great rock which projected from the
hillside. I lit my pipe and wondered
why minutes didn't pass more swiftly.
Certainly she had been there ages. I
put my pipe away. And then â
There she stood in the trail, looking
at me with a gleam In her eyes which
confused me, for I didn't know what
it meant. I had caught It from time
to time all along the way of tribulation
I had traveled for over a month.
"Why didn't you come up, Mr.
Blake?" she inquired, "the view was
excellent to-day."
Was she mocking me? I started to
say something, when from above came
a terrific roar, and glancing up I saw
a huge stone, loosened by some care
less climber, no doubt plunging down
the slope. Miss Winston saw It som
ing and gave a stifled cry, which was
smothered against my breast, for I
had caught her from the trail and
flung her behind the ledge,, jamming
her fiercely against the ground as the
flying monster roared over our heads
and down the canyon side, crashing
trees and stones as it went, till a few
seconds later it struck the bottom of
the abyss with a long, thunderous
crash that echoed up and down the
river like a mighty explosion. Then
all was still.
I turned to the figure in my arms.
She was occupying exactly the same
position as when I flung her behind
the ledge, with her head in the hollow
of my arm.
"Are you hurt?" I asked anxiously.
She shook her head ever so slightly
and kept her face hidden against my
coat. My heart began to beat with a
tumult of hope. "Look at me!" I com
manded.
She raised her face, but her eyes
were averted. She peered over my
shoulder at the depths below. "Isâ
is it coming back, I wonderâ" she be
gan, and the words were stifled, for
my soul was suddenly illumined with
the surety of my blessed fortune, and
I kissed the red lips, wondering
mightily however I had done without
them for so long.
And that was the fourth day.

VALUE OF A BLOCK
According to figures printed by the
Insurance Press there are blocks in
New York City in which $25,000,000
worth of property would be destroyed
if swept by fire. Chicago, Philadel
phia and Newark come next with
blocks valued at $8,000,000 each. Bos
ton and St. Louis have blocks worth
$7,000,000, and nearly two score other
cities can show similar properties at
values ranging from one to six mil
lions.
In a table showing the rank of
States as buyers of fire insurance, New
York easily leads with more than
$4,000,000,000 a year, while Illinois,
Pennsylvania and Massachusetts buy
protection for more than one billion
dollars' worth of property.

While Staples was dressing one
morning the rabbit's foot dropped out
of his pocket without his knowledge.
His wife entered the room and stepped
on the "mascot" Feeling it soft,
furry, yielding to her tread, she jump
ed in fright, shrieking:
"Mouse! Mouse! Help, Fred!
Mouse!"
Sad to say, Mrs. Staples fell and
broke her leg. She will be in bed for
six weeks at least. Staples threw the

BE REORGANIZED
Hoard of Education Acts
. oil Complaint of Teachers
Against Principal Lyser
WILL TRANSFER TUTORS
Accused Pedagogue Puts In
His Defense and Plan Is I
Adopted to Secure Peace!
As a result of the complaint made by
twelve teachers of the James Lick
Grammar School against Principal Al
bert Lyser the Board of Education yes
terday decided to effect a reorganiza
tion of the school so as to make it
strictly a grammar school. To do this
five classes of the primary grades will
be' transferred bodily to the Noe Valley
School, and the grammar grade classes
of the latter school will be moved to the
James Lick School.
In effecting the reclassification several
of the teachers who requested the
board to transfer them to some other
school If Lyser were permitted to re
main as principal of the James Lick
School will have their wishes gratified.
' Lyser appeared at the rooms of the
board Immediately after the regular
meeting. He made a request that he
be allowed to put in his defense in ex
ecutive session, which was granted, the
representatives of the press retiring
from the room. After the session Pres
ident Roncovieri announced that the
reclassification noted would be carried
out in the interest of harmony. During
the conference Lyser said that the
troubles in the school were the result
of the forming of a clique of teachers
from whom he exacted at all times the
strictest compliance with the rules,
which they resented.
."If you wish to consult my personal
comfort and ease, said Lyser to the
School Directors, "please transfer me
â  to some other school at once."
The board did not grant Lyser's re
quest, but directed Superintendent
Langdon to Investigate the complaints
of educational errors alleged by the
. teachers to have been made by Lyser.
These include hfs disregard of arithme
tic and grammar and his making his
tory the paramount study, and the
charge that he did not devote the re
quired time to teaching in the classes.
MAN V TEACHERS ASSIGNED.
The board formally made the follow
ing eight assignments of teachers from
the day substitute list, subject to the
'.usual two years' probationary period:

uary 16, 1905: Miss Annie Silverberg,
from the Humboldt Primary to the
.Spring Valley Grammar; Miss Mar
garet G. Noon, from the Clement

EGAN'S BONDS
NOT APPROVED
Auditor Baehr Refuses to Ac
cept Personal Sureties of
New Works Commissioner
NOT ON THE TAXROLL
Official Must Furnish Item
ized List of Properties
Owned by Two Bondsmen
Auditor Baehr yesterday refused to
approve the official bond for $25,000 of
fered by the newly appointed Commis
sioner of pAlic Works, Thomas F.
Egan. Baehr assigned as his reasons
for his action that the personal sureties
furnished by Egan are not on the as
sessment roll.
Egan's sureties as stated in the
bond are Edward McGary and M. A.
Murphy. After a careful investigation
Baehr ascertained that the only Ed
ward McGary in the city directory and
on the assessment roll died several
months ago. This McGary is down for
an assessment on about $100,000 worth
of property, but as he is dead Baehr
assumes that he is not qualified to act
as a bondsman for a city official.
Baehr could not find the name of M.
A, Murphy on the assessment roll as
qualified to act as surety for a bond of
$25,000. He found that Mary A, Mur
phy was assessed for about $1100 worth
of property and a Margaret A. Mur
phy is down for $580. As soon as Baehr
collected his information he sent for
Egan, who, after some questioning,
admitted that he did not know his
bondsmen personally.
"My bonds were secured by friends
of mine and I do not know them," said
Eagan.
Baehr notified Egan that he would
not accept the bond until the property
owned by the sureties had been desig
nated and itemized thereon. Egan's
bond was acknowledged before James
L. King on January 7, 1905, and was
regularly signed by both Murphy and
McGary.
Edward H. Algeltinger, Commissioner
ot Public Works, has his official bond
already prepared, with Charles S. Lau
meister and Adolph Spreckels as sure
ties for $25,000 each. Algeltinger says
he has twenty days to file his bond
with the Auditor, but will do so before
the expiration of that period.
The ten days from the time of notice
given by a surety company that it de
sired to withdraw from the official
bonds of Works Commissioner Maes
tretti has expired and under the law he
will have to file a new bond. He will
also secure personal sureties, as no
surety company desires to assume the
risk in view of the liability of the Com
missioners for damages for accidents
from defective streets and sidewalks.

ON PARENTAGE
Attorney Bergerot Testifies
to Statement by Monnier
Acknowledging Paternity
TRIAL IS NOT ENDED
Contestant Offers Evidence
Rebutting Testimony of
the Widow's Witnesses
The trial of the Monnier will con- j
test in Judge Graham's court did not
end as expected yesterday, the contest
ant having a line of witnesses in re
buttal who occupied the day, but it is
promised that the last of the testimony
will be heard on Monday. Another in
timation of the problematical parent
age of George Monnier Jr. was brought
out in the examination of P. A. Ber
gerot, the attorney, who waa an ac
quaintance of the deceased liquor mer
chant. He testified that, during the
trial of the younger Monnier's divorce
case, he met the elder Monnier in the
corridors at the City Hall. Monnier
asked if Bergerot had read the ac
counts of the trial, and asked his opin
ion thereupon. Bergerot, according *to
his statement, expressed surprise that
George Jr. was the wlneman's son, and
the father repliedâBergerot gave the
French phraseâthat the boy "was the
child of the sins of his youth."
Heretofore a witness in the case has
testified that there was a certain serv
ant girl from Alsace in the Monnier
household in 1878. She waa described
as an attractive blonde and there were
rumors about her. Mrs. Monnier, the
widow, declared on the Btand that she
had no servant in that or the following
year. Yesterday Mrs. Augusts Bolte,
who said that she took her meals in the
Monnier house in 1878, swore that there
was an Alsatian maid, blonde and
named Lottie, in the Monnier service at
that time. She was asked regarding
the rumor which might throw a light
on the mystery of the contestant's ma
ternity, but Judge Graham sustained
an objection to the question, and the
gossip was not related.
George Jr. was on the stand again
and denied several of the stories of his
abuse of his father. He also said that
Monnier Sr. and his wife taught him to
play poker for the drinka when he was
13, and that he shook dice for his
father over the bar when he waa 15.
The contestant's wife was recalled and
gave a different version of some of the
incidents related by her putative moth
er-in-law. A, K. Henry, father of
Violette Monnier, told of his daughter's
good habits and ambitions, and refuted
many of the charges made against her.
Cassimir Felix, who worked for and
was discharged by Monnier, required
the services of interpreter Courvoisler
to tell of the quarrels he had witnessed
between father, mother and son. He
said that when the boy asked Monnier
for money he got it unless Mrs. Mon
nier was around to make trouble.

PIPER MUST PAY
OR GO TO JAIL
Judge Sloss Orders Him Com
mitted Until $600 Over
due Alimony Is Produced
BENCH WARRANT ISSUED
Â»
Court Does Not Believe Plea
That Weil-Known Shipping
Man Is Without Means
A stay of execution for forty-eight
hours o# an order adjudging him guilty
of contempt of court, did not assist Ar
thur L. Piper In making up his mind
'to pay alimony to ,his divorced wife,
and yesterday Judge Sloss signed an
order for his arrest and imprisonment
until the alimony is paid. Piper was
the secretary of the Piper-Aden-Ooodall
Company. In June last his wife ob
tained an interlocutory decree of di
vorce with an order for alimony. On
September 30 he was $626 behind in his
payments and since then there have
been continual hearings on orders to
show cause why the money was not
produced. Arthur H. Barendt, attorney
for Mrs. Piper, said It was shown that
Piper had drawn $900 a month from
his business up to the time of the
divorce proceedings. Soon after Piper
lost his position as secretary and he
pleaded that he was without funds or
property. On Tuesday Judge Sloss
found that he was able to pay the
money and found him guilty of con
tempt, but on the pleading of his attor
ney a stay was granted which expired
yesterday morning and the commitment
was signed.
William Downing yesterday sued far
an annulment of his marriage with
Sadie Downing*, on the ground that he
was under eighteen and had contracted
the union **lthout his parents' consent.
He says further that he married under
the name of John Franklin and his
wife as Mary Hoyt, both names being
fictitious. The ceremony waa per
formed in 1898.
Judge Troutt annulled the marriage
of E. W. Strassburg and Leta Strass
burg, which occurred In 1898. She had
another husband and had been in
formed by letter that he had drowned
In Australia. She believed It until
she met him on the sctreeta of
San Francisco two years ago. She has
not seen him nor lived with her second
spouse since.
Divorces were granted as follows:
By Judge Troutt to Minnie V. Parker
from John Parker, neglect; by Judge
Murasky to Corabel Martin from Henry
S Martin, intemperance; by Judge
Seawell to Margurite M. Rester from
Paul Rester, desertion and neglect; by
Judge Hebbard to Charles H. Diamond
from Eliza Diamond, desertion; by
Judge Sloss to Margaret F. Butler
from William A. Butler, extreme
cruelty.
Suits for divorce were begun by War
ren A Lester against Florence E. Les
ter, desertion; Helen Proton against
Edward Protou, desertion; Edith O.
Childs against Jerome 8. Chllds, neg
lect and Infidelity; Rose Doran against
George W. Doran, Intemperance.

JURY BELIEVES
IT BLACKMAIL
Marsilio Vanni, Machinist, Is
Acquitted on the Charge of
Having Counterfeiter's Die
HIS WIFE SAVES HIM
Witness Testifies That Two
Italians Conspired to Get
Money From the Defendant
Marslllo Vanni, a machinist with a
chop at 810 Sansome street, was ac
quitted yesterday by a jury on the
charge of having in his possession a
steel die for the coinage of sliver dol
lars.
About a year ago the woman who is
now Mrs. Vanni left him because of
cruel treatment and took up with Giu
seppe Carossl, under whose protection
she remained for eleven days. Carossi
and his chum Francis Visciglio testi
fied that the woman brought with her
the steel die and informed them that
she had taken it from Vanni. Accord
ing to their story they took the die to
Attorney A. B. Treadwell and he ad
vised them to notify the secret service
men. Treadwell telephoned to George
W. Hazen, United States secret service
agent. Shortly afterward Carossl and
Visciglio went into Vanni's workshop
and gave him the die. When they had
left the shop Agent Hazen entered and
found the die in Vanni's pocket.
The defense was that Carossl and
Visciglio had demanded $600 as black
mail from Vanni. The woman subse- !
quently married Vanni. She testified
yesterday that the story about her
having given the die to Carossi and
Visciglio was a falsehood and that she
had never seen the die. J. Semerla
testified that Carossl and Visciglio had j
attempted to blackmail Vanni.
SUES HER LAWYERS.âSarah J. Nicola
yesterday sued the law firm of Crosby A Ryker
for an accounting. She alleges that she em
ployed them to perform certain services for her
in January. 1802, and that they have collected
more than $3000, which they have appropriated
to their own use.

VETERANO SHOWS RETURN OF FORM,
EASILY DEFEATING LITTLE WALLY.
Yada Captures the
Mile Handicap in
a Drive.
Martinmas Is Given
an Argument by
Stilicho.
BY FRED E. MULHOLLAND.
Little Wally, the chestnut gelding
owned by Brinkworth & Co., is ex
periencing more difficulty in making
schedule connections with the long end
of a purse than did Alec Greggains in
securing a brace of scrappers to fill his
January date. Everybody seemed a
unit In pronouncing the mile and a fur
long endurance recital at Oakland yes
terday a scuttle full of steaming duck
soup for Little "Wally. In accord
ance with track customs when such ap
pears to be the case, all possessed of
any means began separating them
selves from it at the ratio of 4 vs. 5.
For a time as he caught the invigorat
ing land breezes from the Berkeley
housetops it looked as if Pilot Davis
and Little Wally might have a speedy
and prosperous journey. But It was
not to be. Mysterious Charley Bell
hove in sight with Veterano on the far
turn, and another tragedy of the turf
is to be chronicled. The Thornton stake
winner galloped over the favorite, ty
ing up at the judges' stand under half
pressure a third of a length before
Wally. Tnk was overburdened with
early speed, but Helgesen made too
much use of him at the start and he
ran third. The winner was quoted at
6 and 6 to L
For a track that furnished the op
portunity for upsets there were few
reversals. First choices held their own
by _ drawing down three purses.
Meada. Veterano and Tada were the
unsuspected ones.
A six furlong sprint for three-year
olds, non-winners at the meeting,
opened the racing. Edna Sullivan, the
mount of Bonner, was played down to
:; 10 1 favoritism. The filly is a very
slow beginner, and at no time looked
dangerous. The winner turned up in
Meada, the mount of Jakie Jones,
which staggered in first, less than a
length before Saccharate. Andvari ran
third.
Following this came another six fur
long selling affair, and it looked as if
Cousin Carrie had fallen into a soft
spot. The mare ruled a7to 10 favorite,
and won in jig time. Helgesen finished
second on Box Elder, four lenghts in
advance of the second choice Yellow
stone.
Quite as easy did Alice Carey, an
other pronounced favorite, capture the
rive and a half furlong scramble.
Away first, Alarie rated the mare nice
ly, and she crossed the finishing line
under closely reefed sails. Anderson
secured the place with Edrodun, a 20
to 1 shot, downing The Reprobate, 'an-
other outsider, more than a length.
Both Revolt and Redan ran exceedingly
poor races.
Charley Henshall's Martinmas took
the seven-furlong purse run. A 2 to 5
chance at post time, the chestnut geld
ing made all the running, and with few
pounds in reserve led Stilicho out a
length and a half. Rowena, the run

Yesterday my $10 Guaranteed .Special was
at 8 to L After leading for three-quarters of
the distance he finished third. The "show"
price against him was 8 to 5, and while many
clients saved their bets I claim no credit for
the Information âIn fact, I count the horse a
loier. Recollect the horse must WIN or there
is no cay to me.
Do you know of any fairer proposition than
this in horseraclng or In any other enterprise?
If so tip me off and I'll become a patron.
MY LON6-SHOT DAY
A sure thing, at a juicy price, la on the
carpet for to-day. It has been cooked up to
order. Track, jockey and all other conditions
dovetail. A stable commission of "extra
wise" money will be down. It's the surest
winner at good odds of the meeting to date.

i
ner-up to the paddock, there tired,
though easily downing Freckman for
the show. Yellowtail ran last.
The mile and fifty yard handicap, for
three-year-olds, furnished the most ex
citing contest of the afternoon. It
proved a wide open betting affair, with
Ara closing a lukewarm 14 to 5 favorite.
While Sea Air cut out all the running,
the field was so closely bunched behind
the filly at the head of the stretch that
to pick the winner waa problematical.
Davis brought Billy Cahill's Yada
through with a rush in the stretch, and,
catching Sea Air passing the paddock,
won by half a length. Sea Air only
beat Lady Goodrich a nose for the
place, with Ara losing the show by but
a short head.
TRACK NOTES.
The Adam Andrew Selling stakes,
with $2000 added by the association,
will be the feature event at Oakland
to-morrow. The cream of the sprint
ing brigade will face the barrier.
Jack Joyner, the well-known East
ern trainer, was an interested specta
tor at Oakland yesterday. He ex
pressed.himself as much pleased with
the looks of California racing.
Eugene Hildebrand, the Jockey, will
come up from Los Angeles to attend
the funeral of a sister who died In this
city.
The handicap was a corking good
betting affair. The same race could
be placed on the card again and there
would be little change In the prices.
On the boat home the talent had It
figured out where every other starter
in the race should have won but Yada,
but for some interference. Sea Voy
age was knocked to her knees, Lady
Goodrich got cut off, so was Head
Dance; Bonner had Ara In the deep
going, etc., etc.

HERFORD STILL
AFTER GARDNER
Baltimore Manager Has Not
Given Up Hope of Match
ing Gans With Lowell Boy
WOULD TAKE ON WHITE
Spider Welch and Mike Sulli
van Will Fight Prelimi
nary to Hyland-Neil Go
Al Herford has not yet given up the
idea of matching Joe Gans with Jimmy
Gardner and if there is any possible
chance of bringing the lightweights
together the Baltimore manager will
eagerly grasp it. He announced last
night that he was willing to match his
dark skinned boxer with the Lowell
lad at 136 pounds at 6 o'clock and di
vide the purse any way the latter
wished.
Herford has .found out that it is no
easy matter to get a suitable match in
this city at the present time. Britt
does not want to talk business and
Nelson Is out of town. Herford does
not figure Young Corbett as a good
drawing card, so the only match in
sight is one with Gardner.
Gardner is still in Butte and, while
he professes to be willing to box Gans,
it is a difficult matter to convince the
sporting public of this fact. If the two
could be brought together it certainly
should prove a good card, as Gardner
is said to be a lightweight worthy of
Gans' steel.
Herford does not think well of Jabez
White, the English lightweight. He
gives it as his opinion that Britt would
wade through the Britisher, who, he
says, is not capable of putting up a
good fight. Herford is willing to pit
Gans against White at 135 pounds at
ringside, the winper to take all or
divide the purse in any way suitable
to the Englishman.
Herford says he will not go after
Brltt and beg for a return match. He
is willing to match Gans against Britt
at 133 pounds at 6 o'clock, but seems
to think there is little or no chance of
bringing the pair together, as Britt /ill
not talk business.
Manager Alex Greggains of the San
Francisco Club has framed up two
good preliminaries for the Hyland-Neil
fight on January 31. Last night he
signed Spider Welch, the local light
weight, and Mike Sullivan, the Bos
ton "Twin." Sullivan left last night
for this city to train for the bout.
Greggains has also arranged a bout
between Joe Angeli, the butcher boy,
and Jack Cordell of Hayes Valley.
These lads met several times and are
very evenly matched. Angeli was
beaten by Mike Sullivan here a few
months ago, but made a game showing.
NEW ATHLETIC FIELD SOON
TO BE BUILT AT STANFORD
Plans Are Arranged and the Work of
Construction Will Begin
Shortly.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Jan. 12.
The task of building a great athletic
field at Stanford is to be undertaken
at once by the student body. The en
gineers of the faculty have volun
teered their assistance and they will
probably be given charge of the ac
tual construction work. The football
field will be built first, as it is abso
lutely necessary that it be ready for
the intercollegiate game with Cali
fornia next fall.
The work of construction of suitable
bleachers, for which plans have been
drawn up by Professor Wing, is to
be commenced soon. During the
holidays Professor Wing and Dr. F.
Angeli made a trip to the University
of California for the purpose of in
specting the bleachers of that football
field. The bleachers erected at Stan
ford will be modeled along the same
lines. It will not be practical to
adopt the suggestion that the new
bleachers be made much steeper.
A temporary design of the plan of
the new athletic ground has been made.
This map Includes space for fields for
Rugby football, association football,
baseball, track and supplementary
baseball and football fields, and leaves
considerable space for further exten
sions. The baseball, football and
track bleachers are arranged so as to
be close together. The training
house is located under the bleachers
In such a way that it connects both
the track and gridiron. When flnshed
the Stanford athletic field will prob
ably be the finest in the world.
INGLESIDE PARK WILL
REOPEN NEXT SUNDAY
Ingleside Coursing Park will reopen
on Sunday afternoon, after being
closed for nearly two months. The

CLASSY DOGS COMPETE
IN THE ALL-AGE TRIAL
Avafon MesSome RemarfaMe Points
BAKERSFIELD, Jan. 12. â The
spectators at the field trials to-day
ware not treated to the spectacular j
work in the all-age stake which has
marked the previous performance of
the great setters and pointers. It waa
no scarcity of birds which brought
about this condition, as invariably the
handlers in shooting over their dogs
have discharged their firearms in the
air, thus saving the quail for addi
tional work with the dogs. The day
was clear and was inclined to be !
warm. This, with the absence of any
breeze, resulted m a lac k of scent and !
was no doubt the cause of so few I
points being made by experienced !
dogs. â¢ j
It is expected the winners in the all- [
age stake will be determined by noon ;
to-morrow. The champion stake will {
then be run and on Saturday the dogs j
will be handled by their owners In the
members' stake.
Some practical joker had all the j
field trials people at the hotel called j
at 5:30 o'clock this morning and a
procession of sleepy sportsmen com
menced to wind its way to the dining
room shortly thereafter. As this
meant an early start on the road, it
was taken good-naturedly.
Each evening a quartet made up of
Judge "Charley" Post and Joe Terry
of Sacramento and Jack Kilgarif and
J. W. Flynn has entertained the mem
bers with a concert. The favorite song
has to do with the joys of the good
old summer time.
The first brace put down in the
morning was the Stockdale Kennels'
liver and white pointer, Cuba Jr.,
handled by R. M. Dodge, and W. W.
Van Arsdale's black, white and tan
English setter McCloud Boy, handled
by C. H. Babcock. After an extensive
run over considerable country Cuba Jr.
drew to a point in weeds, which was
cleverly backed by McCloud Boy. Cuba
Jr. followed this with two more points,
McCloud Boy scoring one.
CONDITIONS ARE FAULTY.
There was something wrong evi
dently with the atmospheric condi
tions, as both dogs, well known to
possess good noses, ran over a num
ber of birds without noticing them.
The second brace to start was H.. W.
Keller's lemon and white setter Som
bra, handled by W. B. Coutts, and
John Considine's black, white and tan
English setter Policy Girl, handled by
J. E. Lucas. This brace was worked
over the same grounds as the preced
ing one. Sombra made three stylish
points, which she held stanchly, one
being made after Policy Girl had run
In front of her to steal the point. Pol
icy Girl made two points, from neither
of which a bird was flushed. Both dogs
showed good speed and range, but, like
the preceding brace, seemed unable to
locate birds on those grounds.
The third brace was Stockdale Ken
nels* liver and white pointer Qlenwood,
handled by R. M. Dodge, and W. W.
Van Arsdale's black, white and tan
English setter. Counts Mark, handled
by C. H. Babcock, were also cast off
on the same grounds as the preceding
dogs. If anything was necessary to
confirm the existence of faulty atmos
pheric conditions the work of this
brace certainly removed all doubt.
These two well-tried dogs, whose bird
finding qualities are well known, ran
for more than a half an hour through
birds which were flushed by the spec
tators without either scoring a point.
The next dogs put down were W. W.
Van Arsdale'e black, white and tan
English setter Avalon, handled by C.
H. Babcock, and J. H. Schumacher's
black and white English setter Valita,
handled by J. E. Lucas. These were
cast off on new grounds where condi
tions seemed much better and scored
a number of points.
AVALON SCORES BIX POINTS.
Avalon placed six to his credit to
Valita's four. Both dogs were under
good control and pointing stanchly.
Avalon especially proved a classy
dog. Moving to another location the

the free handicap at one mile, was
marred by a poor start. High Chancel

lengths behind his field and the latter
was left standing. Flo Bob won in a
drive from Hans Wagner, with Ralph
Young third. Descuento sustained his
reputation as a high class 3-year-old
by wining the fifth race at five and a
half furlongs in 1:07. He was never
urged and won pulled to a gallop.
Montana Peeress was played from 2

ished first, but was disqualified for
crowding Dutiful into the rail when
fifty yards from the finish. Favorites

scoring a point.
I The next brace was W. W. Van Ars
dale's lemon and white .English setter
Jay M, handled by C. H. Babcock, and
J. W. Flynn's black and white pointer
Burbank. handled by W. B. Coutts.
They were brought back to the same
field where Avalon and Valita scored
so many points. Jay M succeeded in
placing five points to his credit, while
Burbank scored but two from which
birds were raised. Both dogs showed
plenty of speed, ranged out well and
were quite stylish on point.
This was the last heat of the first
series of the all-age stake.
After driving several miles to a new
location, Judge Betten announced the
following as the second series: Keep
sake with Ladylike, Cuba Jr. with
Harry H. Sombra with Jay M, Avalon
with Uncle Jimmy, Whltesldes with
Kllgarif, and Mariposa in reserve.
Although It was quite late the Judge
ordered Keepsake and Ladylike down,
expecting no doubt to find a number
of birds close at hand. This* soon
proved a mistake, aa no birds were
found except one which Ladylike point
ed in a stump of a tree. It being dusk
the brace was ordered up.
AMATEUR BOOTS
ARE DISCUSSED
Supervisors Listen to an
Argument by W. G. Harri
son Against the "Sport"
WOULD EAISE LICENSE
ââ  â  â¦
President of Olympic Club
Grills Berger and Fin
nigan for Their Actions
The Supervisors' Police Committee
yesterday began an investigation into
the alleged violation of the rules gov
erning amateur boxing- contests by cer
tain organizations. The committee an
nounced that It desired to correct any
abuses that may have arisen by refus
ing to recommend permits to any club
proven to have transgressed the rules.
"I have watched the development of
the amateur clubs with great regret,''
said W. Greer Harrison, president of
the Olympic Club, who addressed the
committee. â¢"None of the clubs outside
of the Pacific Amateur Association are
legitimate amateur clubs. They are
simply boxing or fighting clubs which
are In the business of developing pro
fessional pugilists.
"I refer to 'Sam' Berger, who Is un
questionably a professional. In that
same class is Finnegan, who resigned
from the Olympic Club because we
would not pay him to contest. Berger
admitted that he had received $200 in
his last contest. The Olympic Club had
decided that it will have nothing to do
with clubs whose members accept pay.
If I were to pay $100 I could get the
best men to box. but I believe this to
be destructive of a healthful sport. I
think the amateur clubs should pay
more money to the city for the priv
ilege 'of giving exhibitiona. I recom
mend that the license be fixed at $250
per month instead of per year as it is
at present.
"The Olympic Club will employ legal
talent and if necessary detectives to
cleanse the amateur sport from. Its dis
graceful condition.
"I further recommend that the Cali
fornia Amateur Association disband
and its members join the Pacific Asso
ciation in the interest of clean sport."
The committee then granted the ap
plication of the Hawthorne Athletic
Club for an amateur contest on Janu
ary 26, on the assurance of Manager Al
Young that the rules and ordinance
would be strictly complied with and
that training expenses not to exceed
$35 for each contestant would be al
lowed. No formal action was taken on
Harrison's two recommendations, al
though the committee rather favors the
merging of the two amateur associa
tions.
O'NEILL NOW PRESIDENT
OF WESTERN LEAGUE
OMAHA, Nebr., Jan. 12.âThe meet
ing to-day of the magnates of the
Western League of Baseball Clubs
proved to be a ratification meeting, at
which was approved a large number
of items of business which had been
previously agreed upon in conference.
At the conference Morris ("Tip")
O'Neill of Oakland was agreed on for
president, and no other name was pre
sented to the meeting. The finances
of the association were shown to be
in good condition. The league was
made more substantial by dropping
the non-paying clubs and transferring
three franchises to substantial busi
ness Interests In the cities represented.
The schedule will not be adpoted until
the spring meeting, which will be held
some time in March.

he says, ten times and knows the coun
try whereof he intends to write better
than most white men. The success of a
series of articles on Peru written by
Agle for a Seattle newspaper induced
him, he said, to vent his literary yearn

gathering additional data for his story.

Three Years in Port.
A week from to-morrow Captain Gibson of
â¢ the British ship Silberhorn will celebrate the
third anniversary of the vessel's arrival at
this port. She arrived here from Liverpool
January 21, 1902. After discharging her cargo
she was towed to an anchorage off Sausalito
and has been there ever since waiting for a
charter. At the time the Silberhorn arrived
charters were higher than they have been
since. A few vessels were chartered for more
than 40 shillings and Captain Gibson laughed
at an offer of 38s 6d. He Is not laughing now.
The charter refused for the Silberhorn was
taken for another ship and from that day to
this the rates have been falling with more
regularity than the cable dispatches have sent
Port Arthur to'its doom. To-day the rate Is
about 12s 6d. The Silberhorn is still waiting
for something more than 40 shillings. During
his three years in port Captain Gibson has
made many friends here. With Mrs. Gibson
he* lives comfortably on board the Silberhorn,
where he frequently entertains. The Silber
horn has become one of the |>ermanent features
of the Sausalito landscape. Th<- apprentices
who came out on the Silberhorn have all b -tt
sent home, their term of service having ex
pired. A new batch was *ent from England
and a second crop of midshipmen la now
.ripening on the llme-jutcer's half deck, and
unless th* Silberhorn gets sailing orders soon
these youngsters will graduate without having
si en the anchor of their ship hoisted from
. the mud. They are being well trains) in
i hipping iron, but the experience they will
cam <m the Silberhorn in seamanship will be
mostly theoretical unless the vessel leaves her
mud bed and salla out agatn among the ocean
breezes where she can stretch her wings and
â¢Â»cat her nose wet. ~. toâl

GOLD HUNTERS
FULL OF HOPE
City of Panama Meets the Co
cos Island Treasure Expe
dition at Punta Arenas
SECURES A CONCESSION
Earl Fitzwilliam Has For
mer Rear Admiral Palliser
With Him on Veronique
Â»
The steamship City of â¢Panama,
which arrived yesterday from the isth
mus, was at Punta Arenas on her home
ward trip in company with the British
steamer Veronique. The Veronique
had on board Earl Fitzwilliam and a
party of British treasure hunters, going
to Cocos Island to gather up the Peru
vian gold buried there, so the legend
runs, many years ago and diligently
searched for ever since. According to
cabie dispatches received here since the
City of Panama left Punta Arenas, the
Veronique either broke down on the
way to Cocos Island or was unsuccess
ful In finding the treasure, for she ar
rived the other day at Panama*and
landed the titled gold hunter, who is
now on his way back to England.
The Veronique is a British tramp
steamer, but by virtue of her mission
and the title borne by her charterer
she figures in the cable dispatches as
a yacht and when the Panama's offi
cers saw her, was flying the flag of
the Royal Yacht Club. On board the
Veronique were fourteen passengers,
all members of a syndicate formed in
England by Henry St. Leger Bury Pal
liser, formerly a rear admiral in the
British navy and once commander of
England's Pacific squadron. Palliser is
on board the Veronique. This is the
third attempt he has made to find the
Cocos Island treasure.
The secret of its hiding place was
confided to him when he commanded
the Pacific squadron. He needed the
money and without a word to his gov
ernment headed his flagship, the Im
perieuse, for the island. He landed
three hundred blue jackets and after
satisfying himself that there was some
thing in the story of hidden gold and
that he held the key to its hiding place,
he withdrew his men and sailed back
to Esquimault.
Meanwhile the Costa Rican Govern
ment protested to the British Govern
ment against Palliser's action In land
ing an armed force without permission
on Costa Rican territory. Palliser was
recalled and retired from the service.
He. had lost his job, but still held the
key to the treasure's hiding place, oÂ£
thought he did. At any rate, he con
vinced his friends that he was in pos
session of a secret that was worth
money. The British steamer Lytton
was chartered to carry home the gold.
That expedition was a failure. The
hiding place of the treasure was found,
but so deeply buried under rocks and
earth that recovering the gold was a
bigger undertaking than the expedition
was in condition to carry out. After
landing Palliser and his party at Pana.
ma the Lytton came north and put in
here October, 1903, short of fuel.
The Earl Fitzwilliam party, say the
officers of the City of Panama, obtained
a concession from the government of
Costa Rica to search-for the treasure
on Cocos Island and. like all previous
seekers after the buried Klondike, were
full of hope and convinced that they
had a get-rich-quick cinch. The Ver
onique had a crew of seventy-four men
and the Earl was prepared to shovel
the whole island into a sluice box if
ordinary efforts failed to bring about a
negotiable realization of the Admiral's
dream. When it was all over the treas
ure-laden Britishers were to land at
Panama, return to England with haste
and buy marble palaces and fast auto
mobiles. The Veronique, no longer a
yÃcht, would be released from her
charter and allowed to go tramping
again. She might visit this port, her
officers said.

HEARS REPORT
OF SECRETARY
â  ,
Applications Received From
Honolulu and Porto Rico
for Bricklayers' Charter
TWO DELEGATES ARRIVE
Detained by a Wreck While
Coming From New Orleans,
They Are Still Welcomed
Secretary William Dobson read his
supplementary report at the session
yesterday of the Interntional Bricklay
ers' and Masons' Convention. He re
ported that an application had been re
ceived from the bricklayers and masons
of Hononlulu and Porto Rico asking; for
charters. He suggested that steps be
taken at this convention to grant cer
tain powers to State conferences which
now belong to the executive body. He
also advised that apprentices should be
employed only by contractors and not
by journeymen. He urged that compo
sition and concrete blocks should be
laid by bricklayers. A suggestion was
made to recognize the faithful work
done by Thomas O'Dee, who waa for
years general secretary, and to pass a
measure for the care of the former
member.
William Jesse and Thomas O'Nell,
delegates from New Orleans, reported
at yesterday's session. They explained
that they had been delayed forty-eight'
hours by a train wreck. As their ex
planation was satisfactory they were
seated. The various committees are
now busily at work, as the time limit j
for submitting new matters has ex-;
pired. Two measures were considered
yesterday. The subject of a referen
dum vote, which was defeated at the
Trenton convention, was again dis
cussed. The secretary was in favor of
it with certain limitations. Correspond
ence was received on this subject frem
the cigarmakers' and carpenters'
unions. The cigarmakers. make a ref
erendum vote on officers a compulsory
matter. Those falling to vote are fined
and this penalty brings out a full vote.
On other matters, where there is no
penalty, only a small vote is cast.
As Saturday will be devoted to a trol
ley ride around the city and Monday
the delegates will go on a bay excur
sion, the various committees have de
cided to hold night sessions Ih order
that they may not fall behind In their
work.
Several of the Chicago delegates are :
advocating another union for Chicago.
There are 3500 bricklayers there. The
committee will investigate the matter
and report back to the convention,
which will render its decision.
FATHER GREY'S CIVIL
SUIT AGAINST BRENNAN
Bank Officials Examined to Trace
Money Obtained by Doctor
From Aged Priest.
The trial, of the civil suit of Father
P. J. Grey, the aged Catholic priest,
against Dr. Thomas F. Brennan for
the recovery of $37,514, which, It is
alleged, the doctor got by fraud from
his feeble patient, was begun yes
terday in Judge Sloss' department and
will be resumed next Monday. Grey
is represented by M. C. Hassett and
was not in court. Brennan was pres
ent with his attorney, William M.
Cannon. A criminal action growing
out of the same transaction was pros
ecuted against Brennan in October, :
but the statute of limitations inter- i
vened to prevent its being brought to
a judgment.
In yesterday's hearing representa
tives of the Hibernia, Crocker-Wool
worth and Mutual Savings banks and
the Union Trust Company gave cvi- !
dence tracing the money from the |
time It was drawn on Father Grey's
order in September, 1901.
A fact not developed in the crimi
nal case was that Brennan had drawn
$15,000 from the bank three days af
ter he and the priest had severed their
relations in November, 1903. Grey,
who is almost totally blind, in 1901 .
engaged Brennan as his doctor and j
they lived together in Alameda Coun-;
ty for more than four years. Brennan i
had interested himself, it was charged, I
in Grey's litigation with the Archbish-
Op, involving the ownership of the
money, which Grey afterward won j
and later the doctor got possession of
the whole sum.
Brennan, who has pleaded in his
defense that the money is his and re
fuses to make an accounting of it, was i
on the stand" yesterday. The import- j
ant point in his examination was |
reached in the question as to what he
has done with the money. This was j
objected to by his attorney and the
court will decide the point on Mon
day.

Holmes' story and moving pictures

BALFOUR'S RULE
IS SOON TO END
Coming Session of Parlia
ment 3lay Witness the
Downfall of the Premier
SURRENDER IN SIGHT
Task of Formulating the
Budget Will Be Handed
Over to the Opposition
LONDON, Jan. 12.âKing Edward at
to-day's meeting of the Privy Council
signed a proclamation convening Par
liament for February 14. The session
wlll*,be opened by the King personally
with full state ceremonies. The un
usual lateness of the date of the re
opening is interpreted to mean that the
Government does not propose to press
any redistribution bill, but to give the
aliens bill, which Premier Balfour had
definitely promised, the first place In
its legislation programme.
Recent speeches of Ministers confirm
the belief in an early dissolution of
Parliament, and It seems likely that un
less previously defeated, possibly
through the Intentional abstention of
the Chamberlalnites, tihe Government
will find a pretext for voluntarily dis
solving Parliament toward the end of
March and hand over to the opposition
the seemingly thankless task of formu
lating the budget.
Premier Balfour, speaking at a ban
quet given in his honor at Glasgow
to-night, avoided the fiscal question,
except to say that he had nothing to
add or retract from his Edinburgh
speech.
Speaking at Liverpool to-day, Joseph
Chamberlain related that on one occa
sion a monarch said to him:
"Of all things connected with your
history, the one I admire most is your
colonial policy."
Chamberlain replied to this:
"I think you do us too much honor.
We never had a colonial policy, but
somehow we have been allowed to
blunder into the best pants of the
world.
The Parliamentary bye-election In
the Mile End (East London) district
to-day, resulted In a victory for Harry
L. W. Lawson, Unionist, by the nar
row margin of 76 votes over Victor
Straus, Liberal.

EXPRESS FEAR
OF A RACE WAR
Residents of Redlands Be
lieve That an Attack May
Be 3lade on the Japanese
BROWN MEN ARE READY
Arm Themselves and Give
Notice That They Intend
to Make Fight if Molested
Special Dispatch to Th* Call.
SAN BERNARDINO, Jan. 12.âA*
sensation was caused at Redlands by
the discovery of a sign In red ink nailed
in front of the Japanese headquarters
and bearing: the following* inscription:
"Get out of here, you Jap dogs, or you
will get hell knocked out of you. Tou
have taken Port Arthur, but you can't
take Redlands. Your dose will be lead
next time."
The notice was embellished with the
usual skull and crossbonea in regula
tion whiteoap style
The trouble began during the orange
picking season, when one of the labor
contractors brought In several Japan
ese pickers, saying white men were too
expensive. The ranchers protested in
fear that this would bring on a Jap
anese invasion of the Redlands section,
but the white and Mexican help had
grown so independent the brown men
had to be accepted. Their numbers
have increased steadily since and the
Mexicans have Joined the whites in
their hostility to the newcomers.
The other day a crowd of white and
Mexican pickers surrounded the house
occupied by the Japanese and hurled
a volley of stones when their threats
were laughed at by the Japanese. The
brown men made a sally with chairs,
billets of wood and like weapons and
the storming party toox to its heels-
The Japanese have armed themselves
with revolvers and announced that
they will defend themselves at all costs,
and the posting of the notice is causing
grave apprehension among the more
temperate of the people of Redlands,
although the sentiment in that city is
decidedly against the Asiatics. It is
said that several of thÂ© wtilte pickers
had purchased small homes upon the
installment plan, but that owing to
the competition of the Japanese they
have been unable to make payments.
AUNT OF YOUNG WEBER
RECEIVES BAD FRIGHT
AUBURN, Jan. 12.âA sensation waa
spoiled this afternoon when Sheriff
Keena's deputies investigated a hasty
summons. The Sheriff's office was rung
up by telephone and the request made
to send two deputies to E. S. Snow
den's house immediately. Mrs. Snow
den is Mrs. Julius Weber's sister. Vis
ions of another murder hastened tha
deputies' feet up the steep hill to tha
Snowden house. Mrs. Snow-den's nerves
have been badly shaken by her sister's
murder and rinding a pistol outside of
the house concluded danger was abroad
and sent for the officer*:. They ven
tured the opinion that the pistol was
Mr. Snowden's, but she said not and
declared that when he brought it down
stairs he always told her about it.
Snowden was on a Jury in a Chinese
criminal case and not until he identified
the pistol and said he took it down to
clean it would she dismiss her fears.
The papers in the bill of interplead
ing were served to-day on Vice Presi
dent Lubeck of the Placer County Bank
and Adolph Weber. The latter laughed
when served and said: A I see they are
still after me. Well, I shall be aggres
sive hereafter and they will find I have
plenty of fight left before they get
through with me." He looks In better
health than a month ago.
Attorney General Webb arrived this
afternoon and has been In close con
sultation with the Sheriff and District
Attorney this afternoon and evening
concerning the Weber case.

ever, states that he haa no assurances
that Miss Bates will play at his house.

tractions.
This waa done, it is hinted, for th* ex
press purpose of heading off Belaaco
and his star. As the matter stands
when Miss Bates closes in San Fran

compelled to Jump Portland unless her

Now York Stock Market.
â¢â¢ NEW YORK, Jan. 12. âSelling predominated
â¢over buying in to-day's stock market opera
tions, but the transactions, were no les*
'â¢Strictly professional than they have been ever
â¢ sini.e New Year's. The traders seemed
'": ipted to sell, mainly by their disappoint
â¢â¢ment over the futility of previous attempt*
to get prices higher. Some of the day's devel
opments- offered a nominal cause for the de
p'resstoa, but there was little evidence of real
liquidation, the traders simply endeavoring to
â¢â¢anticipate what the action would be of real
' holders of stocks. There is undoubtedly con
siderable unsettlement cf mind among specu
lators over the varying and contradictory' r*
â p..rts from Washington regarding the legls
" lative programme. The weight of opinion to
" flf.v was definitely on the side of aggressive
insistence by the President upon measures to
regulate railroad freight rates and curpora
"twÃ affair*, with the question of tariff re
'Vislon relegated to th* background.
The financial district showed its usual sen
sitiveness to the animation of these subjects.
:The action taken by the Pennsylvania direc
tors toward a $60. "00,000 bond issue had an
adverse effect on bullish sentiment, although
â¢some such action has been pretty clearly ex
.pec'.ed. It Is urged by the advocates of active
â¢peculation that the great Interests which have
â¢ theae new issues in view would be anxious to
â¢foeter. an active stock market to assist In
floating them. But that did not prevent a
â 'characteristic reversal of the point of view in
to-day's trading to the apprehension that the
prqepict of new offerings would stagnate the
â¢. demand for securities already In the market.
Come of the stocks which have had the ben
â e'flt recently of rumors of increased dividends
' were notable sufferers in to-day's reaction.
Trie movement of these stocks had a large
sympathetic sffect on the whole list. A rather
more active Inquiry waa reported for time
. loans for the longer periods, and, the further
advance In foreign exchange offered no proe
'â¢pect of any cessation of the outward movement
of 'gold, although discounts In London were
â appreciably easier. London was a seller In
this market, however, on balance, as was
Paris in the London market. In spite of the re
ported success of th* Russian loan In Berlin.

CHICAGO BOARD OF TRADE.
Future Grain and Provisions.
CHICAGO, Jan. 12. âFollowing lower prices
at Liverpool the wheat market here was rather
weak at the May being off a shade
to %@%c at $1 IG%Â®l 17%. The weakness of
foreign markets was said to be due to a re
port from Odessa to- the effect that the wheat
crop of Southern Russia is In excellent condi
tion. The heavy fall of enow In the United
States throughout tha West and Southwest
was reported as affording ample protection
for the winter wheat crop of this country.
There has previously been considerable anxiety
as to the possible damage by cold weather.
The bulls, however, found encouragement in
the continued small movement In the North
west. How much of the falling off.ln receipts
was due to the extremely cold weather and how
much to the smalines* of reserves was, of
course, a matter of conjecture. For that time
there appeared to be a preponderance of selling
orders in the pit. In consequence prices eased
off a trifle. The volume of business at no time
assumed any great proportions, scalpers doing
most of the trading. Later the market sud
denly became quite strong on a fairly active
demand from several prominent commission
houses. An assurance from Minneapolis that
the flour mills there would not close was a
possible reason for the revived demand. On
the bulge May sold up to $1 17%. During the
last hour of trading a reaction occurred, the
advance In prices bringing out Increased offer
ings. Toward the cloee the market became
quite weak May declining to $1 16%. Final
quotations were at $1 16%@1 16%.
Early In the session rather a firm under
tone was manifested in the corn market, but
later selling by scalpers caused an easier tone.
May closed %Â®%c down at 44% c.
The situation In the oats pit was little
changed. May closed at 31 %c.
Provlelons were firm early as a result of
higher prices for hogs at the yards. Later on
profit-taking developed an easier feeling. At
-the close May pork waa off 2%c. ribs were
unchanged and lard wa* a shade lower.
Out of respect to the memory of former
President Charles D. Hammlll, who died last
night, the Board of Trade will close at 12
o'clock to-morrow.

Sweepers Be Purchased.
Commissioner Aigeltinger of the
Public Works Board yesterday or
dered a resolution prepared recom
mending to the Board of Supervisors
the paving of Fourth street, between
Market and Berry, with a pavement
similar to that on Third street. The
sewering of the street from Howard

so the entire improvement may be
carried out.
At to-morrow's meeting of the
board bide for the repairing of the
pavement in front of the Phelan
building on Market street will be or

The Works Board began the filling
of chuckholes on Market street yes
terday with red rock. Aigeltinger will
have the force fill in the holes on
Battery and California and other
streets, as he intends to make a per
sonal effort to have the -streets im
proved. The red rock may be treated
with oil in some localities to prevent
the dust rising.
The inspector of street sweeping
yesterday recommended that six two
horse street sweeping machines be
purchased at a cost of $2000. It is
expected that the Supervisors will
consent to the purchase of the ma
chines, as they regard their rental at

REFUSES TO ISSUE
A MARRIAGE LICENSE
"Cupid" Danforth Declines to Comply
With Application of a Japanese
and a Swedish Woman.
Komaro Umejl, a Japanese, and El
len From, a Swedish woman, ap
peared at the marriage license office
yesterday and requested "Cupid" Dan
forth to make out a license for them
to wed. Danforth informed them that
he could not under the law issue a
marriage license for a Mongolian and
a white person to marry. The wom
an became quite indignant, saying
"There are lots of Japanese and Chi
nese married to white women."
"I cannot help that," said Danforth.
"They must have gone somewhere
else to get married."
At this point the couple withdrew
and began a subdued but earnest con
versation as they left the room.

STEALS MARCH
ON MOSE GUNST
Alfred Lilienfeld Leases
Property at Kearny and
Sutter by Paying More
FALLING OUT RESULTS
Cigar Man Sorely Offended
by Losing Place Which
He Controlled So Long
Mose Gunst Is a sore man, and the
object of his wrath is Alfred Lilien
feld. The latter got the lease of the
building at Kearny and Sutter streets
a few days ago, beating Gunst out in
the race for the possession of the prop
erty. The two men had been friends
up to that time, but now they are at
outs.
Gunst had a lease on the property for
the last twenty-five years, and thought
he could readily get it again for a rea
sonable length of time, forgetting to
figure on any one else stepping in and
taking it away from him at the last
moment.
But Lilienfeld went quietly to work
and framed up a deal whereby he got
the coveted place from Gunst. The
latter had been paying $SOO a month
for the property, but when Lilienfeld
offered the owners $1500 they agreed to
let him have it and passed Gunst up.
The deal was put through on the first
of the year. A few days ago Gunst
was informed that the property had
been leased to Lilienfeld. Upon in
quiry Gunst discovered that Lilienfeld
had raised him, and the rest was easy.
Gunst said he expected to get the prop
erty for $1100 or $1200 a month, but
when Lilienfeld offered $1500 Frank
Burke, one of the owners, jumped at
the chance.
Gunst's lease will expire on April 1.
Lilienfeld intends to remodel the lower
lioor, so the tenants will be forced to
vacate. Gunst says he thought he
would have no trouble in renewing the
lease, and blames Lilienfeld for "but
ting in" and taking it away over his
head.
Lilienfeld says the transaction was
perfectly just and that he has noth
ing to regret. He wanted the prop
erty and he got It by offering a good
sized increase in the rental Gunst waa
paying.
GEBER GIVES TESTIMONY
AT TRIAL FOR MURDER
Says He Fired the Shots to Scare the
Hartmanns and Did Not Mean
to Kill Them.
The evidence at the trial of August
Geber, charged with the murder of
Charles Hartmann at 321 Third
street on Sunday morning, July 10,
was concluded before a jury in Judge
Dunne's court yesterday afternoon and
the arguments to the jury will begin
this morning.
After three witnesses had testified to
the defendant's erratic conduct, Geber
was called to the stand. He detailed
the life he had led since the left his
home in Bavaria. He had served in
the German, British and American
armies and had deserted from the
Marine Corps. He skipped two years
of his life and on cross-examination
had to admit that he had spent them
in San Quentin for burglary in Napa
County.
Regarding the shooting of Charles
and George Hartmann he said he had
not intended to kill either of them, but
had fired the shots through the door
to scare them. After Hartmann Sr.
had threatened him he went upstairs
to get his clothes, but he said nothing
of his getting a revolver instead. It is
the belief of the prosecution that
Geber's testimony and the way he gave
it will disprove the claim of mental ir
responsibility made for him.
TILLMANN WILL NOT BE
PLACED ON HEALTH BOARD
Mayor Makes Definite Announcement
That Some Other Physician
Will Be Selected.
Dr. Frank J. Tlllmann, who has
been prominently mentioned as the
successor of Dr. Joseph Pohelm on
the Board of Health, will not be ap
pointed to the post. This fact was>
definitely announced yesterday by
Mayor Schmitz, who said that several
other physicians, whose names he did
not desire to make public at this time,
were being considered for the place.
The selection of the man haa been left
practically to Dr. Ward, president of
the board.
The Mayor said he would announce
this appointment and that to the va
cancy on the Park Commission prob
ably by next Monday. No intimation
was given as to the probable appointee
on the Park Commission, but an act
ive canvass is now being made by the
friends of William H. Metson. who
was once a member of the board and
was the only one not reappointed by
Phelan when the charter first went
into effect. As it looks now Metson
seems to be reasonably sure of being
appointed.

BROKERS MAKE
LOUD PROTEST
New Custom-House Will Be
Insufficient for the Big
Business of This Seaport
OFFICES AEE CEAMPED
Patrons Say There Will Be
Less Boom in New Build
ing Than There Is in Old
Customs Broker John H. Boden haÂ»
fathered a protest that has been sent
to United States Senator Perkins con
cerning plans for the proposed new
Custom-house building. Other prom
inent brokers, such as P. W. Bellingall
and C. D. Bunker, hava expressed
themselves as concurring in the com
plaints.
The brokers feel that they are not
only speaking for themselves, but for
the business public.
Deputy Collector N. S. Farley has
been engaged for weeks in changing
iloor plans. He has made a report to
Collector Stratton.
CRAMPED FOR ROOM.
The main business room of the new
Custom-house is elliptical, about 38
feet wide and 10S feet long. The pres
ent business room is rectangular, about
55 feet wide and 125 feet long, and the
offices are cramped now. The new
room has far less space except in the
public lobby. The counter in the old
building is about 15 feet from the
walls. Tt does not afford space for
desks and file cases. In the new build
ing this counter is only 8 feet from
the wall, necessitating such extreme
ly cramped places to work in that busi
ness cannot be transacted with any
kind of order or dispatch.
The corridors in the new building are
about 9 feet wide, yet the stairs seem
to be 10 feet wide, and there are three
elevators and only five floors.
The Merchants' Exchange, just com
pleted and now being occupied, has
fourteen floors and six elevators, with
stairs 3*4 feet wide, the corridors being
about 8 feet wide.
Evidently architects do not agree as
to the proper relation between the
widths of corridors and stairs.
The protest is against the proposed
arrangement of offices, and particularly
against placing the Surveyor of Cus
toms and his business office on a floor
separate from the main business part;
also against placing the Sub-Treasury
on the same floor with the main cus
toms office, and against lessening the
width of the alley between the present
Custom-house and Appraiser's build
ing.
ALLEY TOO NARROW.
The present distance . between the
Custom-house and the Appraiser's
building is about forty-one feet. Eight
feet of this space is taken. up by an
absolutely necessary platform alongside
the Appraiser's building for the unload
ing and delivery of merchandise or
dered to the Appraiser's store for ex
amination. This leaves a clean space
of less than thirty-five feet for the hand
ling of trucks and wagons. Several
times the Appraiser's store has become
so overcrowded that temporary Ap
praiser's stores were required and es
tablished by renting warehouses. The
commerce of this port has been increas
ing for five or six years and now over
taxes the present accommodations of
the Appraiser's store and the Custom
house, yet it is proposed to lessen the
width of the alley. This will be a dis
advantage to the importing business.
Brokers and the United States dray
man ask that this alley be made forty
five feet wide, and say that fifty feet
would be none too wide. The brokers
say the building is large enough to
have all the business offices on one
floor, conveniently arranged, so that
business can be transacted with the
minimum amount of running around
from one office to another.
INCONVENIENT OFFICES.
In the present plans the cashier's of
fice, where the duties are paid, is situ
ated on a corridor (probably poorly
lighted) with a big window in the rear.
In order to pay duty importers and
brokers must walk from a deputy col
lector to the cashier, about eighty feet,
thence to the naval office cashier, about
fifty feet farther, then to a deputy
naval officer, about thirty feet farther,
and then retrace their steps to a dep
uty collector, a total distance of 300 or
more feet. The brokers say these of
doe* could be so arranged as to permit
the same transaction to be completed
by walking sixty or eighty feet. As
there are hundreds of such transactions
every day the reduction of the distance
to be covered by each transaction is a
material item with both brokers and
Importers, but the present arrangement
Will compel brokers to employ addi-;
tlonal clerks and messengers, and they
say the Government will be obliged to â¢
employ several additional messengers
also.
The Surveyor's business office being!
placed on another floor from the main
customs office will necessitate a dis
tance being covered by brokers of ap
proximately 200 feet to the deputy sur
veyor and back again, and this distance
Is exclusive of the stairs or elevator.

of 140 or 150 feet, making It approxi
mately 275 feet from the Washington-street
entrance to the paying window of the Sub-
Treasury. From the Battery-street entrance
the distance is less but probably 200 feet.
On days on which pensions are paid and on
general pay days of the numerous Federal em
ployes (and especially when these payments
are" all made on the same day, as sometimes
happens) It is a usual thing to see the wait
ins Hne extending from tne present Sub-
Tureasury down Commerlcal street and
around into Montgomery, a line probably 150
or 2(K) feet long. Place this same line In the
proposed new Custom-house and the corridors
wll! be so overcrowded and Jammed that, the
brokers say. people who wish to transact
business with the Custom-house would be
better to postpone it until some other day.
Patrons say that they cannot understand what
business the Sub-Treasury has in the new
building, and particularly on the same floor
as the Custom-house. They say that lr
the Sub-Treasury Is to be quartered in tne
new building it ought to be placed on the
ground floor, with a separate entrance direct
from the street.
OTHER DEFECTS.
The Internal revenue department Is assigned
to the third or fourth floor on the Jackson
street end. This does not concern the brokers

business wit'i that office. They think, how
ever that it could better be located on the
ground floor, within easier access, both for
themselves and the thousand and one liquor
and cigar dealers who go there to pay their
The most desirable portion of the new build
ing (that Is, the ground floor cm the Wash
ington-street end is taken up for the Immense
storage vaults of the Sub-Treasury and stor
age-rooms for Janitors' supplies.
The brokers cannot understand why these
vaults and storerooms cannot be put In a ba fV"
ment and the Sub-Treasury located here, with
a direct entrance from Washington street.
In the new building are also assigned the
offices of harbor fortifications, coast and
geodetic survey, engineer of rivers and har
bors, Chinese bureau, hydrogreehlc office,
lighthouse establishment, life-saving offices
and other offices not even remotely connected
with the 'customs service, which Indicates that
the new building is misnamedâthat it is not
custom-house, but simply a common Govern
ment office bulldlnit.
