CLEVELAND, Jan. B.â"Fear for
gery charges?" exclaimed Mrs. Cassie
L. Chadwick to a Philadelphia North
American reporter in jail here to-day.
"Neverl They are false. I fear neither
them nor the technical charges in the
Federal courts. I'm neither afraid of
this court nor any court in the land.
1 defy them all.
"Men are cowards. They turn their
backs on a woman when she is down.
They were once so full of assurances,
and - proffers of aid. Now where are
they? But they shall pay for it! I'll
suffer, but not alone, mark you. They
Shall pay their share.
"Dr. Chadwick knew me for three
years before we were married in Pitts
burg. Now, if he didn't find out who
I was in all that time, it isn't my fault,
is it? Am I to blame If he didn't
know whom he was marrying?
"You musn't think that Dr. Chad
wick lost his fortune through my
transactions," she said. "That isn't
true. In the first place, he never had
a private fortune to lose, and in the
second place I gave him more than he
ever had before. This talk of his los
ing $70,000 of his own money through
me is all rot. He never had that much
money.
"The doctor's present impoverished
condition appeals to the sympathy of
his friends. His return home in the
second cabin on a comparatively cheap
boat and his habit of eating at cheap
restaurants mean nothing. He always
did travel that way, except when I was
paying the bills.
"Why, if Dr. Chadwick had $5000
In his pocket and nothing to do with
a penny of it he would rather walk
fifteen miles than spend a nickel for
car fare. That's the kind of man he
Is, and you know it."
Commenting on the fact that he had
been served with an order by the Fed
eral authorities to "produce certain
diamonds and gems," At.torney J. P.
Dawley, counsel for Mrs. Cassie L.
Chadwick, said to-day:
"I have not received so much as a
pewter shoe buckle from either Mrs.
â¢Chadwick or her husband. The serv
ing of such an order strikes me as be
ing humorous."
BUFFALO, N. T., Jan. B.âNathan
liOeser of Cleveland, receiver of the es
tate of Mrs. Chadwick, was in Buffalo
to-day on his way home from New
York, where he had been making an
Investigation :n connection with the
Chadwick estates. Loeser said that
)ie feared that the amount of assets
of the estate so far in hand had been
grossly exaggerated.
"The property which I have in my
possession now, including the house,
freal estate and household effects,
cught, if sold, to bring about $100,000.
There is a real estate mortgage of $35,
--000 on that and a chattel mortgage of
17000," he said.

LONDON, Jan. B.âAnxiety as to the
safety of the steamship Veronique and
her crew was allayed to-day. when
Cowper, Lord Fitzwilliam's private sec
retary, received a cablegram from Pan

was undamaged, and that captain, offi
cers and crew were well. The whole
party has left Colon by steamship, and
will arrive at Southampton within the

A dispatch from London yesterday
stated that the Veronique had met with
an accident, but gave no details. On
board the vessel is Earl Fitzwilliam's
expedition, which had planned to seek
for buried treasure in an island in the
South Pacific. In the party are several

Wonder.
*
Special Dispatch to The Call.
MILWAUKEE. Jan. 8.â"Colonel
Dixon" Is only a delivery wagon horse,
but the animal is learning tricks so
fast under the training of his driver,
Isaac Goodman, that his owner. James
Conroy, is seriously considering placing
him on exhibition. Colonel Dixon is
five years old. He first began to show
signs of unusual intelligence a year
ago.
"At that time I used to teach him to
go to customers' houses without driv
ing," said Goodman. "Dixon seemed to
understand perfectly. 'Go to Bacon's.'
I would say. Away would go Dixon,
turning the corners, and finally stop
ping at Bacon's. 'Perele's next.' and at
Perele's he would stop. In this way
Dixon was able to go to a dozen or
rriore places without being driven."
The horse already can count.
"Colonel Dixon, take three from five
âcan you do it?" asked Goodman of the
horse.
Colonel Dixon nodded his head. Then
he gave answer by stamping his foot
two times.
"Add four and three," said Good
man.
Colonel Dixon promptly stamped his
foot seven times.
Goodman attributes the intelligence
of the animal to telepathy.
"I believe the horse is hypnotized."
said he. "I believe It is telepathy that
makes It possible for the anlmai to srive
correct answers. I aslt him to add three
and four, and I have the answer, seven,
firmly in my mind. I believe the flsrure
is then transmitted to the animal and
he gives the answer. I have never
heard of telepathy being applied to an
imals, but this is the only way in which
I can account for Colonel Dixon's
tricks. I have recently read all about
the tricks of Hans, the German horse,
and I believe before I get through with I
Dixon I can make him do the' same."

Special Dispatch to The CML
NEW Jan. B.âAn advertise
ment which tells of clean, well ven
tilated rooms; healthful, substantial,
well-cooked food, with books, maga
zines and a piano in a common living
room in an especially erected building
in the heart of New York, at 50 cents a
day for men and 40 cents for women,
reveals the latest philanthropic plan
of John Arbuckle, the coffee and sugar
merchant, who established the "floating
hotels" for poor people.
While the attractiveness of the home
he proposes to open will appeal to the
more prosperous classes than those
which it is designed to aid, Arbuckle
intends to exclude all but wage-earners
of both sexes and of good character.
He will in person supervise his novel
hotel. Where this marvel of comfort
and modest rates in boarding-houses is
located Arbuckle declines as yet to dis
close. He said to-day:
"The building is not yet completed,
and will not be for two weeks or more.
I advertised as an experiment largely
and to see how many persons would
apply. When I get answers I will go
over them all carefully and select from
the applicants those who appear to be
the right kind. To each of these I shall
send a pamphlet descriptive of the
hotel. It will accommodate only 100
guests, and at first I shall not let any
one engage a room there except by the
day.
"This hotel is not intended for de
pendents or invalid or aged persons. I
want to fill the house with young men
and women who are working for a liv
ing and as a rule cannot get for what
they can afford to pay anything but
the bare necessities of life. I want to
give at least 100 of them more than the
bare necessities."
John Arbuckle is a bachelor, more
than 60 years old. He and his brother
Charles came to New York and began
the sale of ground coffee in packages.
They went from this to refining sugar,
and aroused the antagonism of the
sugar trust. The "floating hotels"
which Arbuckle sends out on sea trips
every summer crowded with poor wom
en and children are his pet charity.
It is said that Arbuckle's new hotel,
should it prove the success expected,
will be only the first of a series to be
established.

Special Dispatch to Th* Call.
NEW YORK, -Jan. B.âlncidents fol
lowed one another quickly to-day in
the affairs of Brodie L. Duke, the mil
lionaire tobacco man, who has been
committed to a sanitarium. They cul
minated to-night in a siege of the
house of George H. Mallory, Mrs.
Duke's attorney, by a woman who said
she was Mrs. Duke. Mallory refused
to have her admitted and for five min
utes she tried to gain an entrance.
B. L. Duke has been summoned to
appear before the Grand Jury to-mor
row. -Mrs. Duke will become a promi
nent figure in the investigation by the
Grand Jury andthe District Attorney
of the financial'affairs of her hus
band, with which she seems to have
be en ' intimately connected. Previous
to her marriage to Duke, three weeks
ago, Alice Webb had promoted com
panies, being a member of a stock
brokerage house, and had apparently
won the confidence of many bankers in
small towns of the South and Middle
Wtst.
The authorities at Bellevue Hospital
have deposited with the District Attor
ney the bonds, stocks, notes and
checks to the face value of about
$60,000, which were found in the
pockets of Duke when he was taken
into custody at the instance of hie
relatives on the ground that he was
not competent to manage his own af
fair*. '
Mrs. Agnes d'Esplaines, an associate
of Mrs. Duke, also has been sum
moned to appear before the Grand
Jury.
All persons connected with the af
fair were reticent to-day as to details,
but the hint was given in many quar
ters that developments of the great
est interest might be expected.
Concerning the financial career of
Miss Webb in Chicago and this city
many interesting facts developed to
day. Her connection with Mrs.
d'Esplaines seems to have had no con
nection with the various commercial
interests in which she was interested.
Mrs. d'Esplaines, who is her senior by
several years,, was once proprietress of
a resort on West Thirty-second street.
The two women have been on terms of
intimate friendship for many years
and they were living together when
M!ss Webb made the acquaintance of
Duke.
Dispatches from Chicago say that
Mrs. Duke is a daughter of W. H.
Webb of that city and that she in
herited her talent for financial man
agement from her father.
Rev. W. Woe, Dr. Parkhurst's
fist assistant, who performed the wed
ding ceremony for Duke and Miss
Webb, said to-night that he did so
knowing nothing of Miss Webb's ante
cedents and making no Inquiries about
them. He said also that at the time
Duke manifested no signs of mental
disturbance, although the clergyman
admitted that in the excitement of the
ceremony Duke gave answers In the
wrong place at times.
The statement was Â«made to-night
that George H. Mallory, Mrs. Duke's
attorney, had severed his relations with
the woman, and that this was the rea
son for her attempt to gain admission
to his residence.
Mallory was averse to entering into
any discussion of the transactions.
There are among the papers in the
temporary custody of the District At
torney's office three promissory notes
for $5000 each, said to have been made
on December 5 last by Duke to Miss
Webb, four days before their marriage,
and due in three, four and five months.
Mallory said he had an idea they were
to be used in connection with the
financing of the Texas-Cuba Tobacco
Company, of which Mrs. Duke was
president before her marriage.
It was said to-night that the decision
of the- Duke family to take steps to
annul the millionaire's marriage was
reached when it was discovered that
Mrs. Duke was once proprietress of the
"House of All Nations," a notorious
resort.
CHICAGO, Jan. B.âln marrying
Brodie L. Duke, who was placed in
a sanitarium on Long IsTand yester
day, Mrs. Duke, who resided in
Chicago before the wedding, gave up a i
remarkable business career in this city.
Before the wedding Mrs. Duke, who is
the daughter of William H. Webb, a ,
well-known Chicago business man, had l
aided in the promotion of several large
Industrial concerns, and at the time
she became the wife of Duke, which
has been less than a month ago. she
was president and secretary of the firm
of Taylor, Webb & Co., a prominent in

YOUTHFUL MURDERERS
MAKE A CONFESSION
Two Tramps Tell of Their Brutal Crime
TWO YOUNG TRAMPS WHO HAVE CONFESSED TO THE BRUTAL MURDER OF GEORGE DUNN, NEAR CRESCENT CITY
LAST MONTH. THEIR VICTIM AND THE SHERIFF OF DEL NORTE COUNTY. TO WHOM THE YOUTHFUL MURDER
ERS TOLD THE STORY OF THEIR HEINOUS CRIME.
Horrible Details of the Killing of Aged George Dunn Near
Crescent City Given to Sheriff of Del Norte.
CRESCENT CITY, Jan. B.âWithout
a tremor and with no display of
fear or sorrow, Harry Brown
and Frank Kelley. two youthful
"hoboes," now confined in the
Crescent City Jail, confessed that on
the night of December 29 they took
the life of George Dunn, a genial
Irishman, long past the three-score-
and-ten mark, who for years past
kept a store on the lonely Crescent
City-Grants Pass stage road. The con
fession was first wrung from Brown
by Sheriff Crawford, who, by cleverly
playing upon his fears that his part
ner in crime was about to turn state's
evidence, induced the youthful but
hardened murderer to tell the story
of the awful crime.
Glibly and with an air of bravado,
and still with the cringing and fawn
ing air of an Informer, Brown de
scribed the last moments of the aged
storekeeper, whose great heartedness
had won for him the respect and es
teem 6f the residents of Del Norte
County. - Only once did Brown falter
in his bloody tale, and then his hesi
tation was not due' to any feeling for
the white-haired old man whose life
he had helped to take. He faltered
because he did not know for a cer
tainty whether his confession would
earn him the reward of the cowardly
informer âusually immunity from the
death penalty. He hesitated long
enough to ask if he or his partner in
crime was to be benefited by the con
fession. When assured by the Sheriff
that he would "get all that was com
ing to him" he breathed a sigh of re
lief and went on with his tale of cow
ardly, treacherous murder.
PLANNED IN ADVANCE.
â¢ Armed with the facts obtained from
Brown, part of whose conversation
with the Sheriff had been overheard
by Kelley, purposely placed in an ad
joining cell, the official paid a visit to
the latter. He found him pacing his
cell in a frenzy of excitement, fearful
of the consequences because his com
panion in crime had been more craven
hearted and selfish than himself and
had forestalled him in his plan to save
his own neck at the expense of his
companion's.
"What's the matter with that fel
low?" he cried almost before the
Sheriff had entered the cell. "Is he
getting cold feet? Is he turning
state's evidence?"
The Sheriff, by evasive answers,
succeeded In still further arousing the
fears of Kelley. Possessing the craven
heart so essential to the makeup of
one who could take the life of an aged
and helpless man, Kelley could not
stand the strain. Cursing and swear
ing he paced his cell, occasionally
stopping to shake his fist in the direc
tion of his companion in crime. The
strain became too great for him to
Special Dispatch to The Call.
bear, and finally with a foul impreca
tion he said, "Bring me an attorney
and I will tell the whole story."
Quickly the Sheriff summoned Dis
trict Attorney F. W. Taft, and within
a short time Kelley gave to the two
officers the story of the brutal murder
of George Dunn at the hands of him
self and Brown. Not a detail was for
gotten by the youthful criminal. His
story was- even more complete than
that told the Sheriff by Brown.
Dunn's murder, according to the
tales of both men, was planned in
Waldo, or., two days before it was
committed. Forced to leave Waldo by
the officers of that town, Kelley and
Brown wended their way to California.
Their objective point was Dunn's
lonely roadhouse. From Brown first
came the suggestion of visiting the
old man. He had heard rumors that
the old fellow had gold galore hidden
in the store. The suggestion fell upon
willing ears. Kelley was as anxious
as Brown to get the money, at what
cost It did not matter. They stopped
at the Monumental mine and there
the club with which the old man's life
was beaten out was picked up. The
hands of Brown fashioned the weapon.
USE CLUB AND AN AX.
The two men knew that Dunn was
a courageous old fellow and Would
give battle If provoked. So they de
cided that Kelley should insult him,
while Brown would await a chance to
deal him a cowardly blow. But their
plans miscarried. At Dunn's they met
two men in search of work. The pres%
ence of the strangers delayed their
game, but they got rid of them by
sending them to the Monumental mine,
hastening their progress by telling
them that two men were needed there.
The strangers disposed of, Kelley
rapped at the door of Dunn. The store
keeper told him to enter. Upon enter
ing the store Kelley, deterred at first by
the stalwart figure of the Irishman,
lost heart and hesitated. A gesture
from Brown stirred him to action, and
he raised his hand and shoved the old
man against the counter.
"That's your game, is it?" said Dunn,
regaining his balance and facing his
assailant.
The old man bravely rushed at Kel
ley, who Jumped to one side. Brown
took a step forward and brought his
heavy club down upon the white head
of the gallant old man, felling him to
the floor. The old man struggled *o
rise, but another blow stretched him
senseless upon the floor. Again and
again did the club fall, and soon life
was extinct.
"Get an ax," cried Brown to Kelley.
The latter did as he was told, and
when he returned Brown compelled him
to use the weapon upon the prostrate
form.
"I did not hit him hard," whlnlngly
said Kelley during his confession.

Completed.
TOKIO, January B.âGeneral Nogi's
report,- received at 11 o'clock last I
night, announces that the transfer of j
Port Arthur prisoners was completed j
on Saturday afternoon. The total .
number was 24,369 â878 officers and |
23,491 men. \
Fifty per cent of the officers will
share imprisonment with their men.
The Japanese intend to establish a
naval station at Port Arthur. Vice-
Admiral Y. Shibayama will be placed
in charge. The military administra
tion at Port Arthur will retain only
a small garrison as soon as the pris
oners are withdrawn and order is
restored.
The fleet is busily engaged in clear
ing mines, but owing to their great
number navigation will be unsafe for
a long time. Only Government craft
will be allowed to enter the harbor.
It is probable that Dalny will soon
be opened to neutrals. Japanese com
panies are prenaring to establish
weekly services to that port.
It is proposed to float a fourth
domestic war loan soon, under the
same conditions as the third was
negotiated.
Lieutenants General Fock, Smyrnoff
and Gorbatowsky and Rear Admiral
Wilmann will be brought to Japan as
prisoners of war. Lieutenant General
Stoessel will leave Dalny on January
12th on a Japanese transport for Nag
asaki. He will be accompanied by
the other paroled officers. The Rus
sians probably will remain in Japan
a few days and then proceed on a
French steamship to Europe, going by
way of the Suez canal.
Reports previously received were to
the effect that both Lieutenant
General Fock and Lieutenant Gener
al Smyrnoff had bzen killed at Port
Arthur. On January 2 a St. Peters
burg dispatch denied that Fock had
been killed, ' ut admitted that he had
been wounded. A dispatch received
from Mukden on January 7 said
that while the death of Fock had not
been published, it had for six weeks
beÂ»r> accepted there as a fact. The
report of General Smyrnoff's death
had never been confirmed.

"The map of Port Arthur, which
the Russians produced on December
18 in support of their complaint that
the Japanese fire was damaging hos
pitals, shows seventeen hospitals scat
tered throughout the old and new
towns. To avoid hitting these the
Japanese would have had to refrain
from firing altogether in the direction
of both towns."
Japanese Attempt a Surprise.
PORT ARTHUR. Jan. B.âThe Rus
sian prisoners, while waiting to-day
at Changkinztzu, a railway station for
Dalny. celebrated the approach of
their New Year. Religious services
were held in the morning at 10 o'clock
and the assemblage of prisoners was
addressed by a Russiau priest in full
canonicals. After the services there
was music and dancing on the open
ground in front of the station.
The 8-year-old daughter of a Rus
sian officer was among the prison
ers. Fifty per cent of the officers are
going to Japan.
Opium smoking has reached im

churia, to which Russia already is for
mally pledged.
There is no confirmation of this
statement of Count Lamsdorff's posi
tion, beyond the general knowledge
that he always has belonged to the 1
peace party. It is quite probable that
the peace talk has been produced by
the arrival of foreign papers, as it re
ceives no encouragement in responsi
ble quarters here.
The belief which existed in well-in
formed diplomatic circles that Japan
would follow the fall of Port Arthur
with moderate peace propositions has
not been realized. Up to the present
time nothing has reached the Govern
ment, either through the United States
or other channels. Diplomats here can
not figure out the general lines of a
treaty at this juncture which both bel
ligerents would accept, but realize that
if Japan makes any sort of offer, un
less it is rejected outright as not en
tertainable, negotiations would be
opened, and. negotiations once entered
upon, friends of both parties could use
their good offices and bring about good
terms. This is the only hope for a ter
mination of the war which diplomats
can see. >
Solemn services in honor' of those
who fell in the defense of Port Arthur
were held on Sunday in the Kazan ca
thedral and the Troitka monastery.
The service passed off without demon
stration of any sort. Neither the Em
peror nor any member of the imperial
family was present. A requiem was
held simultaneously in the chapel
Tsarskoe-Selo.
COSTLY TO CHINA.
Land of Confucius Mast Pay Part of
Japan's War Bills.
TACOMA, Jan. 8. âSam B. Trissel,
the Associated Press correspondent
who has Just returned from the seat
of war, in an interview to-day said:
When peace coimb In the Orient the Jap
anese wilWifw Korea and China will rayM'tr
Manchuria and pay the freight. I am willing"
to go on record with that prediction. I say
that China will be obliged to bear a large
share of the expense of the war because no
Intelligent man believes that Russia can be
compelled to pay war indemnity. She will lose
territory which she has tried to grab, but her
home resources and her international position
are too great to admit of the possibility of her
being forced to pay any bills but her own. She
will be forced to recede from an unwarranted
rositlon. Nothing more can be extorted from
her.
China will be compelled to share Japan's
war expense, because Japan is fighting the
battles of that nation as well as her own.
When an international convention settles the
terms of peace it undoubtedly will be decided
that China's preservation from dismemberment
Is the boon for which she ought to pay. and
the powers will fix the price. China will have
nothing to sayâshe ran simply pay.
Even the poor in the United States
and England eat white bread. In most
of the continental countries of Europe
rye bread Is the staple. The Russians
use buckwheat. The Laplanders have a
bread made of oaten meal mixed with
pine bark, and the Icelanders make
their flour from lichens. Banana flour
Is used in the South Sea islands.

Surprise Attack
on Kuropatkin

HUANCHAN, via Mukden, Jan. 8. â
The expected advance of the Japanese,
which the Chinese prophesied would
take place on the Russian Christmas,
has not occurred. Even the usual
cannonading has not taken place. The
troops celebrated Christmas yesterday
quietly. There were Christmas trees
in many companies and little celebra

Many men exchanged presents, mostly
their own handiwork, quaint and cu
rious gifts, there being little obtain
able in the way of conventional pres
ents.
NO LINE ON CASUALTIES.
War Department Unable to Figure Up
Losses in the Far East.
WASHINGTON, Jan. B.âln despair
the War Department has giving up try
ing to get an accurate line on the total
of casualties in the Russo-Japanese
war. At the outbreak of hostilities in
the Far East a War Department clerk
of German birth and unsophisticated
mind started to make a record from the
press reports of losses. He forgot to
take into consideration the fact that
the Russians call a battle by one name
and the Japanese by another and that
official reports straggle in days after
the first news and are frequently con
fused with later events.
At the end of 1904 the clerk began to
foot up his figures and found that they
showed the Russians had lost 4,397,000
men and the Japanese 5,778,000 men.
His visions of making money out of
the first "authentic record of losses"
took wings right there and he gave up
the job.
The bureau of military information of
the War Department adopted a similar
course at the beginning of the war. but
when the totals showed more men lost
than there are soldiers, non-combatants
and neutrals in all Manchuria they, too,
turned their attention to more profit
able lines.
STANDARD OIL
IN NEW FIELDS
Manager of Big Corporation
Seeking to (let Control of
Gas Companies in South
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES, Jan. BâHenry H.
Rogers, manager of the Standard Oii
Company, is negotiating for the pur
chase of the various Lowe gas com
panies of Southern California. Leopold
Wallach, who effected the sale of the
San Francisco Coke and Gas Company
(a Lowe concern), has been in Los An
geles conferring with the Lowe people.
He has made a proffer to some of the
heaviest stockholders and this fs now
under consideration.
There are three Lowe companies
operating in Southern California, the
Independent Gas Company, capitalized
at $3,000,000, and proposing to sell gas
at wholesale; the Los Angeles Sub
urban Gas Company, capitalized at
$3,000,000, with about ten miles of
mains, now doing business with retail
customers, and the California Coke
and Gas Company, capitalized at $1,
--000,000, supplying customers in Pasa
dena, South Pasadena and Long Beach.
If the Standard Oil succeeds in its
ambition here, or rather, if the Lowe
people succeed in selling to the Stand
ard Oil, the Los Angeles Gas and Elec
tric Company will have a rival worthy
of its steel. The Los Angeles Company
has hitherto bought or beaten out its
rivals with ease, and the Lowe com
panies, though now operating, have not
proven formidable competitors.
TO RACE AGAINST DEATH

Countess Gyzicki, Mrs. Patterson's
daughter, lies critically ill with acute

Countess Gyzicki was Miss Eleanor
Patterson, daughter of the well-known
Chicago publisher. She was married
last April to Count Gyzicki of Russia
at the home of her mother in Wash

been living at the country estate of

BUSINESS MEN
URGE NEW LAWS
Long List of Suggestions
to Be Taken Up by the
National Board of Trade
INTEBEST IN SHIPPING
Various Bodies Desire Some
Legislation to Help Build
Up the Merchant 3larine
WASHINGTON, Jan. B.âThe pro
gramme of recommendations and reso
lutions to be considered at the thirty
fifth annual meeting of the National
Board of Trade, which will begin here
on Tuesday, January 17, has been made
public. An unusually large number of
resolutions of interest to the business
interests of the country have been pro
posed by representative commercial
bodies for consideration, chief among
which are those relatiÂ»g to the mer
chant marine, the interstate commerce
laws, reciprocity, uniform bills of lad
ing, reduction of the tax on alcohol
and improvement of various water
ways.
\ arious boards of trade and trans
portation and chambers of commerce
have presented resolutions urging Con
gressional legislation for the upbuild
ing of the American merchant marine.
In various resolutions enlarged powers
are asked for the Interstate Commerce
Commission. The New York Board of
Trade, by resolution, expressed itself
as opposed to the bill conferring the
rate-making power on the commission.
The board expresses the opinion that
it seems wiser, for the present at least,
to rely on the recently applied methods
of enforcing the decision of the com
mission by injunction rather than to
enact the Cooper-Quarles bill, the pro
visions of which it holds may be con
strued to be much more far-reaching
than even its advocates are willing to
defend or consent to.
Railroad pooling is favored in several
resolutions and so is the institution by
the Government of a parcels post, such
as several foreign nations now enjoy.
The adoption of one-cent postage for
Invoices and the improvement of the
Mlsslsippl River and of ' coastwise
waterways are also urged. The impor
tance of international arbitration
treaties is set forth in a number of
resolutions and an expression is made
for an early ratification of those now
pending. *
The Scranton (Pa.) Board of Trade
requests the adoption of a resolution
asking that the President Join other
powers in a determined effort to com
pel Russia and Japan to submit their
differences to The Hague tribunal for
arbitration.
The Boston Chamber of Commerce
wants reciprocity with Canada, and
other commercial bodies ask that our
foreign trade be extended by treaties
of a reciprocal character. Free alcohol
for industrial purposes is advocated by
the Cincinnati Chamber of Commerce
and a reduction of the tax on that
commodity by the Philadelphia Trades
League.
The Sugar Manufacturers' Associa
tion of America urges that If reduc
tions be made in the existing tariff on
goods or articles imported from the
Philippines, Jthere should be excepted
from such reductions such articles
grown, produced or manufactured in
the United States as would be serious
ly affected by such reductions.
MARIE CORELLI AGAIN

i LONDON, Jan. 8. âIn a letter to the
London newspapers Marie Corelli re
peats her remarks on Carnegie's policy
in connection wifh the Homestead
strike and intimates that she Would
like to see a strike at each one of his
new library buildings. She says:
"There was plenty of time for Mr.
Carnegie to forego his quiet holiday in
; Scotland and attend to his duty, which
1 was to take a week's easy journey
over the sea and boldly confront the
situation in person. So might he, if
he Is indeed a philanthropist, have
saved unnecessary bloodshed and truly
earned the right to be considered a
friend of the people.
"That he remained quiescent, in
active and only expressed regret when
the mischief had been done implies
that all the cruel business was carried
on with his tacit knowledge and con
sent, for in the course of four months
he must certainly have received both
letters and telegrams disclosing the
real state of things at the works.
i "The part he played in the affair is
openly set forth in a volume giving a
complete history of the struggle by
Arthur Burgoyne. I should like to see
a copy of that book in every Carnegie
â  free library."

MAY END FIGHT
BY COMPROMISE
Factions on Statehood Bill
May Agree to Eliminate
Arizona and New Mexico
POSSIBLE LAST RESORT
Enemies of Measure Do Not
Oppose Admission of the
Other Two . Territories
I WASHINGTON, Jan. B.âThe state
hood bill will continue to be the prin
cipal topic of discussion in the Senate
during the present week, but other
measures will receive attention each
day during the morning hours, includ
ing the omnibus claims bill, for which
Senator Warren stands sponsor. An
effort will be made to get through the
bill providing for the compensation of
American fishermen whose vessels
were seized previous to the arbitration
of 1593.
The pure food bill will remain in the
background for the present, not be
cause the friends of'that measure have
abandoned it, but* because they con
sider that its chances will be improved
by not pressing for immediate consid
eration.
Discussion of the statehood question
will begin on Monday with a speech by
Senator Morgan. He will be followed
by other opposing Senators. The pres
ent plan of the opposition is to keep
the discussion going until some of the
appropriation bills are reported and it
becomes necessary to take them up:
or, if this is postponed too long, to dis
place the bill with the pure food bill.
Failing In all these expedients, they
probably will seek a compromise.
The only real fight Is against the
uniting of Arizona and New Mexico,
and there is talk of eliminating those
Territories entirely from the statehood
proposition. It is believed if this were
done the bill for the consolidation of
Oklahoma and Indian Territory would
pass.
It is the Intention of the House to
begin active consideration of appro
priation bills during the present week.
Monday is District of Columbia day
and the resolution providing for the
ceremonies of the inauguration of

where the inauguration ball shall be
held will be considered.
PIONEERS PROTEST.
Arizonans Object to the Joint State
hood Bill.
TUCSON. Ariz., Jan. B.âAt a meet
ing of the Society of Arizona Pioneers
this afternoon an earnest protest
against the merger of Arizona and
New Mexico jointly into a State was
adopted. In substance it follows:
Ye declare that the pledge of the Federal
Government In the enactment of the organic
law creating Arizona Into a territorial govern
ment and defining the geographical boundaries,
in which It was agreed Arizona should enjoy
Territorial government until erected Into a
State of the Union, was a sacred compact,
which the pioneer citizens of Arizona (compris
ing the sons and daughters of every State of
the Union) accepted In good faith, and In con
sideration thereof have given years of suffering
and tell, enduring great privations and hard
ships at the risk of life in conquering, develop
ing, civilizing and the building up of the pros
perity of the State of Arizona.
We plead that the compact may be kept In
violate by the Government, and only changed
or modified upon the consent ot the citizens of
Arizona, whose rights should be considered,
and we earnestly pray that, If determined to
pass the joint Statehood bill now before the
Senate, It be with the Foraker amendment,
leaving the question of merger to the vote of
the citizens of the respective Territories.
Gratitude is expressed to Senators
Bard, Foraker, Baker and others for
standing by Arizona.

DIVORCE ISSUE
IS DISCUSSED
I David Starr Jordan, Rev. D.
C. Gardner and Attorney
Wright Give Their Views
i TRINITY CHURCH FILLED
â¢
Big Congregation Listens
to Opinions of Lawyer,
Educator and Clergyman
âÂ«
In a noteworthy discussion of the
divorce question, Dr. David Starr Jor
dan, president of Stanford University;
the Rev. D. Charles Gardner, chap
lain of Memorial Chapel, Stanford
University, and John A. Wright, the
attorney, occupied Dr. Clampett's pul
pit at Trinity Church last night. In
spite of the inclemency of the weather,
the stately church was filled.
Dr. Clampett expressed his appre
ciation of the large attendance under
such conditions and spoke of the sub
ject which was to be treated by the
speakers, declaring that it affected the
sanctity and the purity of the homes
of the nation. He said the laxity in
the matter of divorce became a serious
menace to the life of the American
republic and the community, which
should welcome anything that would
draw serious attention to the existing
conditions.
The Rev. Mr. Gardner, speaking
"On the Christian Obligation of Mar
riage." said that In the United States,
and especially in California, the peo
ple were face to face with a serious
looseness of public sentiment on the
subject of marriage and divorce. The
record showed 60,000 divorces in one
year, 1650 being in San Francisco, a
record which he thought boded ill for
the welfare of society. In it he saw
the lack of reverence for the marriage
state and a woeful lack of stability In
public sentiment. *
The purity and sanctity of the mar
riage relation, he held, was so bound
up with human happiness and social
order that it needed to be safeguarded
by a refined and intelligent social sen
timent and based upon sound moral
principles. He had long felt that the
mending and making of canons on di
vorce and remarriage to control the
members of particular churches was
not enough and that the time was ripe
for a campaign of education as to the
i right idea of marriage itself.
AN IDLE MAN OR WOMAN.
President Jordan treated the "So
cial Side" of the subject and pointed
out in his characteristically clear
manner that "It takes leisure to be
unhappy, and that in every divorce
! case there was at least one Idle man
or idle woman."
"Marriage," said Dr. Jordan, "rep
: resents the most important incident in
the life of a man or woman, and di
vorce is the confession of failure.
There are two classes of divorcesâ
the Inevitable and the trivial. It Is
clear that a general divorce law should
exist and that remarriage should be
delayed.
"There are three classes of poorâthe
Lord's poor, the devil's poor and pau
pers. So with divorces there are the
Lord's divorces, the devil's divorces and
the divorces of those who cannot have
partners."
The speaker pointed out the pitiable
situation of young women sold by their
parents, caught by a glitter of one
good trait among bad ones, and mated
to disease and moral death.
"Men," said Dr. Jordan, "place their
wives In squalid boarding-houses, fine
'or shabby, with only make believe dv-
I ties, with nothing to hear but gossip,
! nothing to think but personalities,
nothing to read but sentimental trash
| and no amusement save folly and vul
garity. It Is no wonder then that there
Is deterioration."
DANGER IN STAGNATION.
He disclaimed being an advocate of
the social whirl, but that, he said, was
better than stagnation: Neither did he
advocate a life of money-making, but
he considered that money-grabbing
gave strength of a kind.
"Anything," he was sure, "is better
than a clammy life warmed with red
pepper and whisky." ,
John A. Wright spoke on the present
i aspect of marriage and divorce from a
civil lawyer's point of view, and in a
lucid manner explained the law of mar
riage and the contract created by the
parties to the marriage. He showed
i where States refused to recognize di
vorces granted in other States. In
America there were, he said, fifty dif
ferent jurisdictions. In an expression
of high regard for President Roosevelt
he suggested that there should be an
amendment to the United States con
stitution and that all churches unite
on one day in a petition for a constitu
tional amendment giving Congress
power to establish a uniform law of
marriage and divorce.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Jan. B.âThe Tribune
publishes the following In Its naval
gossip from Washington:
"The Navy Department Is in favor of
closing Mare Island navy yard, or at
least reducing it to a third or fourth
class yard. The greatest difficulty con
tinues to be encountered In the ap
proach to the yard, and It Is found
that the largest cruisers and battle
ships must go to Puget Sound, as the
depth of the water in the channel of
the Mare Island navy yard is not suffi
cient to admit those ships. It is pro
posed to establish a navy yard some
where else In San Francisco Bay. and
several localities are under considera
tion.
"Rear Admiral Endlcott, chief of the
Bureau of Yards and Docks, and other
officers who know something of the
conditions at Mare Island, are in favor
of closing or transferring the yard, al
though they are willing that another
year's trial shall be made of keeping
the channel open."

Preacher Barred From Regu

Soon Finds New Quarters
Special Dispatch to The Call.
TACOMA, Jan. B.âBarred from using
his church by a temporary restraining
order issued yesterday. Rev. B. A.
Sand, pastor of Zion Norwegian Luth
eran Church at Everett, preached to
day in Normanna Hall. As far as he
is concerned the church building will
remain empty. Until final action be
taken on the Injunction he cannot use
the building.
Action for a permanent Injunction
was begun several days ago by Princi
pal Dardon of Bethania School. It Is
the result of a church wrangle which
has been brewing for some time*. Some
of the students of Bethania School have
taken the Rev. Mr. Sand's part and
criticize their principal for "mixing In
church politics and bringing lawsuits."
Instead of "attending to his classes."
Sand's friends say the cake probably
will be settled out of court.

Pardee was the principal guest at a
duck dinner given at a, local rotlsserie

Cal Ewing and J. Walker Scott,
who said they shot them. Many State

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL. MONDAY, JANUARY 9, 1905.
The golden Jubilee of St. Mary's
Church (Paulist fathers), the Rev. H.
H. Wyman rector, was observed yes
terday. Archbishop Montgomery being
celebrant at solemn pontifical mass at
11 o'clock. He was assisted by the Rev.
Father M. J. Connolly as deacon and
Rev. Father J. E. Cottle as subdeacon.
The Rev. Father Michael Otis was mas
ter of ceremonies.
The Very Rev. Father Prendergast.
Vicar General, delivered the sermon
and said in part:
There wu ample room In this broad land of
California for the aboriginal inhabitants and
for the new race, and It la very probable that
the founders of thlÂ» commonwealth would have
found means of preserving the old missions had
they not been brought to desolation by the
Mexican policy of secularization before the
stars and stripes first waved over the shores of
Monterey.
Unfortunately, by that time many of the In
dians had abandoned the missions; soma of the
Franciscan fathers were. dead, or had with
drawn broken-hearted from the scenes of their
devoted labors; some of the missions were al
ready despoils of strangers; the first Bishop of
California. .Garcia Diego, was sleeping the
peaceful sleep of the just, and Santa Barbara
and its fine mission church were about to yield
precedence to San Francisco and thla the first
St. Mary's Cathedral. It was. however, for
tunate that Archbishop Alemany was appointed
first Archbishop of San Francisco. He was
qualified in every respect to be the connecting
link between the old and the new.
A Spaniard by birth, but a missionary for
years in Ohio and Tennessee, he was in full
sympathy with American ideas and was uni
versally respected by the American people,
while he was held in veneration alike for his
office and his personal virtues by the old race.
. Under him that race gradually disappeared
with honor, and the new entered upon Its great
career.
Father Prendergast dwelt upon the
changes in the environments of the old
cathedral, which made the building of
the new cathedral necessary. He also
referred to -the coming of the Paulist
fathers from New York to preserve the
old church, perpetuate its work and to
restore to it something of Its former
glory.
There were many pastors present,
also representatives from Jesuit,
Salesian and Franciscan orders, and
the Right Rev. Monsignor Ferrant,
vicar and patriarch of Constantinople,
was in the sanctuary.
The decorations, which were very
beautiful, were the work of the Misses
Louise. Clara and Cecilia Daly and
Mrs. Sally Walter.
GOULD PLEADS
FOR STUDENTS
His Letter Aids to Secure
Reinstatement of the Four
Suspended Columbia Boys
NEW YORK, Jan. B.âFollowing: the
receipt of abetter from Klngdon Gould,
asking clemency for the four students
who were suspended in connection with
an attempt to seise him for the sooho
enores' dinner Just before the holidays,
announcement has been made by Dean
Hutton of the school of applied sci
ences of Columbia University that the
disciplined menâAlgeltlnger, Cauchois,
Doty and Finchâwill be allowed to re
turn to their work at the reopening of
the university this week.
Before the announcement was made
there was a conference between Presi
dent Butler, the members of the board
of student representatives and the four
suspended students. The purpose of
disciplining the four men was to make
plain to the students themselves and
to the public the fact that hazing
would not be tolerated at Columbia,
and that end, it is said, has been ac
complished. /
Kingdon Gould in his letter asking
that the suspended men be allowed to
return accounted for his possession of
the revolver, which he fired to frighten
off the sophomores, and expressed his
wish to finish his course on terms of
good fellowship with the other stu
dents of the university. Regarding the
revolver he wrote: /
I always take long ride* in the country after
the college work of the day. usually returning
after dark. I frequently take with me a pis
tol. On the day in question I happened to
have it, and when attacked I fired it in the
i air so that by the consequent surprise of the
fellows I might gain time and opportunity to
reach the frat house, where I was going to
eet my lunch. I had not the slightest inten
tion of doing harm to any one. and never sup
posed the Incident would be taken seriously.

PITIFUL ENDING
OF RUINED LIFE
Bettina Girard, Once the
Belle of Washington, Dies
Raving With Delirium
HER CAREER A TRAGEDY
Beginning Amid Refined
Surroundings, It Sinks
to Gutter and Workhouse
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Jan. B.âDeath ended
the eventful career of Bettina Girard
in Roosevelt Hospital early this morn
ing, where she was taken raving- and
delirious, under the name of Elizabeth
Witter, from a house in East Forty
first street on Saturday.
The career of Bettina Girard was full
of contrasts, over which scientists
puzzled. Beginning amid the refined
surroundings of a wealthy and dis
tinguished family in Washington, it
sank as low as the gutter and the
workhouse, to rise and fall, year in
and year out.
One week upon the stage, showing
flashes of brilliancy and with features
and form little changed, she would ap
pear, only to be found the next week
helpless in the street from vices that
held her absolutely captive.
Bettina Girard was 35 years of age,
a daughter of General Albert Ordway,
the famous soldier. From her earliest
childhood two sentiments appeared to
possess herâone an inordinate love of
admiration and the other a desire f#r
sensation.
Stories are told of the pranks of the
girl at a quiet little convent in George
town and of her departure from there
to finish her education under tutors;
of her daring horsemanship and love
of novelty; finally of her debut in
Washington society. Pretty, vivacious
and brilliant, she immediately became
the leader of the younger set. She was
the toast of army and navy. At a
part"' a young diplomat asked:
"What must I do to become
famous?"
"I will show you," she said,-laugh
ingly.
There was a whisk of drapery and
the young woman stood holding aloft
her slipper. Filling It with champagne,
she held it toward the young diplo
mat.
"Drink a toast to fame," she com
manded, laughingly.
Nothing daunted, the toast was
drunk. *
After being divorced from wealthy
Arthur Padelford, she became an
actress. It was then that her mental,
moral and physical eccentricities be
gan to develop. She at once entered
the whirl of gayety. No constitution,
however rugged, could stand the strain.
Drugs, to which she had recourse,
drink and kindred dissipation soon as
serted themselves and it was not long
before police courts, sanitariums and
hospitals had her name daily on their
records.
She was married seven times. One
husband was a millionaire and six were
actor? or vaudeville artists.
MAKES ESCAPE
FROM ASYLUM
Former Unitarian Pastor De
clares That He Was Sane
When He Was Committed
Special Dispatch to The Call.
MONTREAL, Quebec, Jan. B.âlncar
ceration in an asylum by persons who
are said to have first bereft him of his
church in Gouverneur, N. V., and an
escape by night to Canada, form an
epitome of alleged persecution told by
Rev. Ure Gordon Mitchell, a British
subject, and for some time pastor of
the Unitarian church at Gouverneur.
Mitchell said that in 1898 he was sent
to Gouverneur by the New York State
body of the church. He labored there
until a short time ago, when, he said,
false charges were made against him,
but he fought them down. He con
tinued:
Then, for the last six years of my residence
in Gouverneur, my wife, with whom 1 had
been living in peace for about fifteen years,
became imbued with the doctrines of the (Chris
tian Scientists, whose theories were repugnant
to me. She plagued me incessantly with books
and pamphlets, and every 'lay harangued me
until my life was a burden. After a particu
larly aggravating session In August of 1904 I
snatched up the books, and, placing them in
a stove, burned them.
Three days later I was walking down one of
the principal itrcets of the town when I was
called into the effice of one of my opponents.
"He would like to see you," the office boy told
me. I entered the inside office and found my*
self In a trap. My opponent was sitting there,
and as I entered a couple of deputy sheriffs
entered by the back door.
"You have been acting strangely," he said.
"We are here to examine you as to your sani
ty."
I was thunderstruck. A couple of his fol
lowers went through the farce of an examina
tion and without further ado I was committed
by a magistrate to the Point Erie Asylum,
near Ogdensburg.
There 1 spent three harrowing months, and If
sane when I entered I was constantly afraid
that my sanity would give way under the hor
rors of that confinement. 1 was tortured by
the attendants, but finally made my escape by
night and fled to Canada. I will ask the Brit
ish Government to take up my case.
Honored by Millions.
The total admissions to the World's Fair
were 19,000,000; of this number approximately
3,000,000 were officers, exhibitors, concession
aires and employes; 6,000,000 were residents
of St. Louis and 10,000,000 non-residents. Es
timating that each non-resident visited the fajr
at least four times, it would appear that 2.
--800,000 people came to St. Louis in the seven
months and during this same period more than
1.260.000 people passed through the Anheuser-
Busch plant. Never before has an establish
ment been honored by so many visitors, and it
is safe to say that at least one-half the people
who came to St. Louis availed themselves of
the opportunity to inspect the greatest plant of
Its kind in the world.
1904 was the banner year in the history of
the Anheuser-Busch Brewing Association, its
sales being 1.265,711 barrels of beer, showing
an Increase of 163,949 barrels. The latter as
an annual output would exceed that of the
majority of the larger breweries of this coun
try. This phenomenal increase is the more re
markable because the past year, owing to the
long winter and abnormally cool summer, was
a decidedly off year for the beer business. Ths
total gain of the beer output for the United
States for 1904 was about 900.000 barrels, thus
proving Anheuser-Busch's Increase of 163,949
barrels to be about 30 per cent of that of all
breweries combined. Such an exceptionally
good showing can only be attributed to the ex
cellence of their products and the courteous
treatment of their patrons.
A number of companies are prospect
ing for petroleum In various parts of
Mexico. A gusher has recently been
struck near Tampico. on the property
of the Mexican Petroleum Company,
which has been sinking wells in the
region for the last two or three years.
Other wells are being sunk near the
gusher, and experts believe that the
company is about to be rewarded for
the money it has spent upon prospect
ing by the finding of oil in paying
quantities.

SENATORIAL CANDIDATES RENEW BATTLE
AND EACH CLAIMS THE TOGA.
Flint's Supporters Manifest Greatest Elation/
SENATOR BAUER TAKES ADVICE PRE
SUMABLY FROM JESSE MARKS.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO, Jan. B.âAll the can
didates for United States Senator who
were here last week have returned to
the scene of action with renewed con
fidence of ultimate success. The Flint
forces outwardly manifest the greatest
elation and F>lnt himself Is in a happy
frame of mind. It is known to the
"insider" of the Flint campaign that
Senator Hamilton Bauer of San Fran
cisco has agreed to vote for the Los
Angeles candidate on the first ballot,
and may decide to stay in that camp
until the finish.
It is given out that Senator Bauer's
constituents in the metropolis advised
their representative in the State Sen-
ate to take the Flint end. It is pre
sumed that Jesse Marks gave this ad
vice to the young Senator, and it is
suspected that some one as close
to Herrln as even Walter Parker has
discussed the situation with Jesse
Marks.
Some of the statesmen are wonder
ing if Knight is to get the gold brick
after all that has been said of the
"hands off" proposition. -The question
is asked if it can be true that George
Knight, who says that he has "win
tered and summered with the old
chief," is living in a fool's paradise.
The Bard forces are elated also, but
they are not making wild claims of
strength on the first ballot. They are
willing to wait for the story as it will
be told in the rollcall next Tuesday.
BARD'S MEN ARE FIRM.
E. O. Gerberding. Frank J. Bran
don, C. T. Elliott, Thomas Hughes. C.
A. Young, David Perkins, James A.
Louttit and Dr. Rowell were at Sena
tor Bard's headquarters to-night. They
all aver that encouraging reports are
received. The notion that there Is a
wavering or weakness In the 3ard
column seems to be absurd. The
alignment for Bard will be hard to
break. It Is said by the politicians to
be the firmest bunch In the field. The
Republicans who have avowed their
intention of supporting Bard on the
first ballot will go' the whole route
with him.
The Republicans of the Bard camp
are stalwarts. They have not "win
tered or summered" with the old chief
of the Southern Pacific machine and
do not go to Herrin's office for instruc
tions as to their votes for United States
Senator. Bard's strength on the first
ballot may cause more than a ripple
c,f surprise, although he cannot come
here to personally refute the cam
paign canard that he Is 80 years old
and very feeble.
The arrival of Ulysses S. Grant this
afternoon created a ripple in the poli
tical situation until it was learned that
PERSIA PAYS
FOR A MURDER
Makes Partial: Reparation
for Death of Rev. Labarree,
an American Missionary
WASHINGTON, Jan. B.âlnformation
has reached the State Department
that, complying with the insistent de
mands of the United States, the Per
sian Government has made to the
widow partial reparation for the mur
der of the Rev. Benjamin W. Labar
ree, an American missionary, by a
gang of fanatics and has promised that
all the guilty persons involved in the
crime will be punished. The following
statement regarding the case was
made b.v an official of the State De
partment :
On March 15 last the Department of State
received telegraphic intelligence of the mnrder
of Rev. Benjamin W. Labarree, an American
missionary, near Ouroumla. in Persia, by a
gang of fanatical Kurds.
A demand was immediately made for the
arrest and trial of the murderers, whose
leader, Seyd Mirghafar. was looked i.pon as a
lineal descendant of the Prophet. This cir
cumstance and the fear of arousing religious
disturbances obviously interfered with the
prompt and efficient action on the part of the
local authorities. The most pressing and ear
nest representations of the Ameriaan legation
at Teheran remained fruitless until the 12th
of October, when Mr, Hay instructed the
Minister by cable to make known to the Gov
ernment of the Shah the President's concern
in the adequate punishment of all the crim
inals and hts Intention to lay the matNr be
fore Congress, with appropriate recommebda
tl' ns if his demands for full justice were fur
ther delayed.
The murderers were thereupon arrested, but
the Persian Government, holding the life-of a
descendant of the Prophet sacred, offered a
pecuniary Indemnity in lieu of the death pen
alty of Mirghafar, and promised execution
of his accomplices. After consultation with the
widow of the Rev. Mr. the offer was
accepted and an indemnity of $3".<w> âgreatly
in excess of the cum named by the widow â
was paid to the American legation on June 3.
Solemn assurance was given that the guilty
would receive effective and sufficient punish
ment and that no special tax would be levied
on Christians In the province to recover the
amount of the Indemnity.
The President has complimented United
States Minister Pearson at Teheran for the
energetic and efficient manner In which he
has managed the case there.
Causes of Poverty.
That a certain number of the pov/
erty strickenâhow large a proportion
no one knows âare the result of vicious
ness in our social system there seems
little doubt. If the viciousness could
be located and corrected these paupers
would become self-supporting and self
respecting citizens. The thriftless,
able-bodied ne'er-do-wells, whom
neither education nor opportunity,,can
improve, could at least be forced to
earn their own living and cease to be
a burden on the workers of the world.
With these two classes of mendicants
eliminated, there would still remain
enough of the flotsam and jetsam of
humanity, helpless through mental or
physical weakness or disease, to fully
occupy the charitable Instincts of the
race.
It may" be considered doubtful
whether the science of sociology has
.reached a point where a poverty com
mission, relatively similar in purpose to
the monetary t>r sanitary commission,
could throw any light on the subject;
indeed, there are probably as yet few
men competent to serve In such a body.
But it Is a safe prediction that if the
submerged tenth Is ever to be perma
nently raised it will be through the
study of poverty on scientific rather
than sentimental lines.âNew York

he was not a Senatorial candidate.
Grant was met at the station by Sena
tor Ward, who had reserved him a
room next to that of Candidate Flint
at the Golden Eagle Hotel. He was
taken in charge by Governor Pardee
and dined with the chief executive.
He retired early, after a short chat
with General Stone.
GRANT' NOT IN FIGHT.
"I am not a candidate for United
States Senator," said Grjant, "and had
not even heard until I got here that
my name had been mentioned. No, I
am not espousing any one's candi
dacy."
"In case it was shown that none of
those now In the race could not be
elected and your friends should see a
good chance for you to win out, would
you get into the race?" was asked.
"No, I will not be a candidate under
any circumstances," replied Grant.
The San Diegan will leave for home
to-morrow afternoon.
Henry T. Oxnard brought up a large
bundle of business letters which he
plunged into as soon as he reached his
headquarters.
"I can only say," he stated, "that I
am well satisfied with the outlook.
Matters seem hi good shape and I
think I shall win."
"Absolutely nothing new In the situ
ation," said George A. Knight. "I
still look on myself as tne winner.
Everything is looking well for me."
Candidate Flint was smiling like the
rest of them. He talked of accessions
of strength, but said he could give no
figures or names.
"I talked with several legislators
while In San Francisco," ne said, "and
made gains of strength there. No, I
could not give the names of those
whose support has been promised me
since I left. I am still in the fight, and
am gaining strength every day and I
think I'll win."
That's what Arthur Flsk said- Like
the rest of them .he had no figuresâno
names.
WILL VOTE FOR RTJEF.
It Is pretty well understood to-nijcht
that Ruef's bunch will vote for Abe
himself. The legislators composing this
aggregation think he has as cood a
right to aspire and as good a chance
to win under a "hands-off" order as
Knight, Flint or Flsk. Whether the
bunch votes for him or not. It is een
erally understood that It stands solidly
enough for Abe to jump any way he
points and at the time he indicates.
Quite a number of the legislators saw
ex-Governor Gage in San Francisco
to-day, and in reply to soundings on
the Senatorial contest received the
word from him that he would not under
any circumstances become a candidate
for United States Senator.
IN PORT WITH
CARGO ON FIRE
British Steamship Zambesi
Reaches New York After
Series*of Mishaps at Sea
NEW YORK, Jan. B.âThe British
steamship Zambesi, from Savannah for
Bremen with a cargo of cotton and
phosphate, put into this poA this morn
ing after a most eventful voyage, with
her cargo of cotton on Are and with
several of her crew sick. Captain
Rooney of the Zambesi reports that he
sailed from Savannah on New Year's
day. The vessel experienced very se
vere weather. All went well, however,
until January 5, when the vessel struck
a, submerged wreck, which broke the
stem and stove in several of the bow
plates under water, causing the fore
peak to fill with water. The ship was
immediately headed for port, nearly 500
miles distant.
Heavy weather prevailed and furious
seas flooded the forward decks. On
January 6 volumes of smoke were seen
pouring from the fore hatches, and it
was evident the cotton in the hold was
on Are. The ship's hose was quickly
connected and the fire was soon under
control. On Saturday morning five fire
men who were asleep in the forecastle
were discovered in an unconscious con
dition from the fumes of the burning
cotton and phosphate. They were re
moved from the forecastle to the
steamship's cabin, where they revived.
The steamship will discharge the car
go In her forward holds and will prob
ably go into dock for repairs. She hails
from London and is consigned to

The Times is still easily the most
authoritative Journal not only in Eng
land, but in the world, and it gives the
cue to all the provincial organs that
share its views. The Times, indeed, is
not a newspaper; it is the Times, it is
an institution, a necessity, as much a
part of the unchallenged order of
things as the monarchy itself. A short
time ago when the Times was reducing
the price of its subscription to $15 a
year, the editor of a great London
daily remarked to me that the move
was a mistake. "Instead of lowering
the price," he said, "they should double
it. It now stands at threepence a
copy (6 cents); they should make. It
sixpence a copy (12 cents). I cannot
imagine them losing a single subscrib
er. Everybody who is anybody In
England has to have the Times, what
ever its cost"
Â«I do not know whether my friend's
calculation was economically sound,
but it shows what is thought of the
Times that one of the shrewdest edi
tors in London could launch the Na
poleonic idea of publishing it at 12
cents a day. That the Times Is some
times heavy, that it is often preju
diced and intolerant, especially on
Irish affairs, is undeniable; but its un
rivaled foreign service, the excellence
and authority of its special articles
from all countries and on all political
subjects, and its magnificence in
throwing open its correspondence col
umns to arguments on all sides of
every public question more than Jus
tify Its reputation and more than ex
plain Its position and Influence. It
comes nearer to being a national forum
than any journal in the world.âHar

PROFESSORS HUNTING
FACTS ABOUT WHEAT
University Scientists Are Busu
Solving Gluten Problem.
WILL ISSUE BULLETINS ON THEIR WORK
Berkeley Office San Francisco Call,
R4B Center Street, Jan. 8.
Professor E. J. Wickson of the agri
cultural department of the State Uni
versity returned last night from a tour
of northern wheat growing districts,
the trip being preliminary to an ex
haustive examination of the wheat
grown in every part of California, to
determine what localities produce
wheat richest in gluten and v.hat con
ditions are responsible for the wheat
found to contain most gluten.
Professor Wickson's work is being
done partly under the auspices of the
State University and partly In connec
tion with the State Board of Trad-
other commercial bodies of California.
â These commercial organisations have
raised a fund of $3500 and are to ask
the Legislature for $10,000 more, to pay
the expenses of Professor Wickson's
series cf investigations into the "gluten
In wheat" problem. His assistant. Pro
fessor Stubenrach, is giving the larg
est part of his time to this matter and
other members of the staff of the uni
versity's agricultural department are
contributing their aid to the solving
of a problem which is considered of
vital importance to the State. Profes
sor Wickson says:
It Is well known that th* growers and deal
ers in wheat haw feared a loss of prestige for
California's product because of the lack of
gluten seme of the wheat has shown. The
question of improving the condition? under
which wheat Is grown and of suiting the seed
to the noil, the climate and other agricultural
comittlfiiÃ Is what has been given to us of the
agricultural department of the State Pnlver
elty to solve. The Investigation of conditions
Is necessarily the first work to be done, and
this Is what we are now carrying on.
A TEDIOUS WORK.
My trip to Podding was merely an Incident
and not of any particular bearing upon the In
vestigation, for it Is not until all the dataâan
immense quantity of dataâhave been secured
by all oat men that definite conclusions can be
obtained.
The work of determining what can be done
to a-id to the gluten in California-grown wheat
i> n..t the tyork of v day. or a week, or a
m- nth. or a year. Many sections of our forces
must contribute their help to solving that prob
lem.
I. for example, will procure specimens of
grain, and our assistants who work at farmers'
Institutes and in other fields of work through
. out the State will do likewise. Hundreds of
pounds of wheat will be brought Into the la
boratories at the university. The wheat is
ever now crming in. I found a lot of It on my
desk When 1 returned last night.
I am to go to Sacramento In a few days, and
in that valley 1 shall procure samples of
wheat. The farmers will talk to me and I
shall talk to them about the conditions under
which they have grown the wheat they give to
me for inspection. All the peculiarities of soil,

in mind. In the laboratories! Professor Shaw
and Professor Jaffa aflo now giving some of the

tain the proportion of gluten in the grain.
Their experiments will be continued for an in
definite period.
My i wn examination of the grain will be of
i iHi.rt-nt sort, and the principal part of my
labors and thoso of my assistant. Professor
Stubenrach will be devoted to tho examining
of soils and the comparing of climatic condi
tions with the getting of information from
farmers ahout their methods of wheat raising.
This work is not .'.ltogether a new thing for
uf. What wo are beginning to uo now in the
wheat problem is merely a broadening of the
work we beuaii ft:vera 1yÂ« .irÂ» ago. Part of the
fonds fair** l '-'en provided lor Its extension,
and the results, we hope, will be corresponuing
ly more valuable.
Two experiment stations are to be
established by Professor Wickson's de
partment, at each of which Professor
Stubenrach will be in charge, and
there scientific tests will be made of
wheat grown at the station under con
ditions which will be known perfectly
to the scientists.
BI'SY STATIONS.
One of these stations will be at Yuba
City and the other at Modesto. It is
Professor Wickson's opihion that these
two locations are as good for repre
sentative purposes as any that could
cave b*Â»en chosen. Land has been set
apart for the growing of wheat there
under Professor Stubenrach's direction
and he hÂ«s been provided with varie
ties, so that no grain is left unrepre
sented in the tests that will be made.
Professor Stubenrach will send his
grains to the chemical department of
the agricultural college here for analy
sis by Professors Jaffa and Shaw. In
stead of waiting until all the experi
ments' are concluded to give out a re
port of the work, however, bulletins
will be issued at irregular intervals,
acquainting the farmers and others
who are interested in the "gluten in
wheat" question, knowledge of what
ha? been learned by the investigators.
The money contributed by the com
mercial bodies of San Francisco and
the State and the Sacramento Devel
opment Association is intended to be
merely the beginning of a fund for the
expenses of the gluten investigators.
It was given, according to Professor
Wickson, because it seemed good to
have the investigation begun at once
and also to encourage the Legislature
to appropriate a larger sum at the cur
rent session. It was necessary, too, to
nave money now, even if an appropria
tion is made at this session, for if it
was made it would not be available
until June.

DOES NOT CARE
FOR THE COIN
Berkeley Ofliceseeker In

SPRINGS NOVEL POINT
Town Trustee Opposes Plan
to Increase Emoluments
Even of Place He Wants
Berkeley Office San Francisco Call,
2148 Center Street, Jan. 8.
Redmond C. Staats, member of the
Board of Town Trustees, has thrown
a bombshell into the ranks of the poli
ticians in Berkeley by announcing his
candidacy for the office of City At
torney 'and in the same breath de
claring that he will strenuously op
pose any proposal to raise the salary
of the office, as is contemplated by a
part of the Board of Trustees.
Staats is believed to be unique in
thus taking the stand of a man who
desires a public office, but who Insists
that he will sturdily fight any plan
which has for its object' the elevation
of the salary of the office in ques
tion.
For some time the Trustees have
had in contemplation the readjust
ment of the salaries of all officials of
Berkeley. It is proposed to increase
the amounts paid to the Trustees, the.
Marshal and his deputies, the Treas
urer, Clerk, Auditor, Recorder, Attor
ney, Tax Collector and the assistants
employed by each.
The ground' for the proposed plan
was found in the progress the city has
made, such progress having carried
Berkeley, it is declared, from the
status of a city of the fifth class to
that of a city of the third class. Those
who wish to see official salaries ele
vated declare that the duties of of
ficials have increased with the growth
of Berkeley and that salaries should
be raised in proportion.
Trustee Staats alone opposes the
proposed horizontal elevation. His
declaration last night of intention to
seek the office of Town Attorney, now
held by Brewton Hayne, and to insist
as a condition of his candidacy that
the salary be kept at its present fig
ure is expected to disarrange the plans
of Staats' confreres. Staats' move is
looked upon as a proceeding likely to
find great favor with the public and
incidentally to advance his interests.
The regular meeting of the Trustees
is to be held to-night and it Is cx
i pected that action will be taken upon
| the proposal to revise the official sal
ary roll of the university town.
POWER PLANT
UNDERGOES TEST
Big Boilers in Building on
University Campus Ready
for Work They Are to Do
Berkeley Office San Francisco Call,
2148 Center Street. Jan. 8.
Tests have been made by the con
tractors in charge of the construction
of the university's expensive and elab
orate heating and lighting plant, pre
liminary to the connecting of the ma
chinery with various university build
ings to which the plant will supply
heat, light and power. The connections
will be made next week.
Four buildings on the campus are
ready to be supplied with heat from
the new plant, these being the new
California Hall, Harmon gymnasium,
the Rudolph Spreckels laboratory and
the university library. Live steam will
be carried from the power plant to
these buildings and then hot water
will be sent through the pipes in the
buildings, this being known as the
Plenum system.
According to the figures of Victor H.
Henderson, acting secretary for the
regents, the new power plant will cost
about $60,000. It is paid for out of the
general improvement fund of the uni
versity, which fund receives a fourth
of the two-cent tax on each $100 worth
of property in the State. The brick
work cost $11,136; the three safety
water tube boilers, $9050 10; the oil
burning plant, $9151; a Mackintosh &
Seymour engine, $11,585 60; concrete
foundations, $6990; steam piping and
steam distributing system, $9300.
All the buildings on the campus, and
the grounds as well, are to be l'ghted
with electricity from this plant All
the power needed in each building,
where much power Is constantly re
quired, will be supplied by the new
plant. At present an inadequate power
plant supplies part of the light and
power and some is purchased from
outside companies.
In addition to the advantages gained
from centralizing all the sources of
supply, and adding to its volume, the
authorities say that the danger of fire
in the buildings which will be heated
from the new plant will be greatly
lessened.

MANY DEATHS
IN ONE HOUSE
Four Die Within Two Weeks
in a Mission Home and
Superstition Is Roused
Is there something uncanny about
the former home of Frank Schmidt at
347 San Carlos avenue? That is the
question that superstitious people in
the 'Mission are asking. Four of its
tenants died within a few days of one
another and only one survives. Dwell
ers in the neighborhood shudder as
they pass it and speak of it in whis
pers.
Within two weeks four people who
lived at this house of mystery, 347 San
Carlos avenue, sickened and died.
Three passed away in the house and
one died at the City and County Hos
pital. Following is the death record of
the place over which some evil spell
seems to have fallen:
Frank Schmidt, died December 24, of
pneumonia.
John Richardson, his brother-in-law,
died January I, of the same disease.
Mrs. Emma *Richardson. John Rich
ardson's mother, died January 4, of
heart failure.
George Wiser, a young man who at
tended Schmidt and Richardson, was
taken ill of pneumonia and died at the
City and County Hospital January 7.
The startling mortality in the one
house gave rise to the belief that some
contagious disease raged in the neigh
borhood. But an autopsy held on the
remains of young Wiser at the City
and County Hospital revealed conclu
sively that he died from pneumonia.
There is no suspicion that the four
deaths were not all from natural
causes, as all were thoroughly investi
gated. The tragic circumstances can
only be attributed to a strange freak
of the Death Angel.
The only tenant of the 111-fated
house who has survived the visitations
of death is Mrs. Mattie Schmidt,
widow of the first to die, sister of the
second and daughter of the third. Mrs.
Schmidt is heartbroken over her whole
sale bereavement.

RECALLS WORK
OF FIFTY YEARS
Rev. W. A. Brewer Gives
Historical Sermon at St.
John's Church Jubilee
EULOGIZES DR. AKERLY
Communion Serv ice Is Held
in Memory of Former Rec
tor of the Pioneer Parish
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1016 Broadway, Jan. 8.
Fifty ago to-day St John's
Episcopal Church of Oakland was or
ganized, the'opening service being con
ducted by the Rev. E. W. Syle in a
small room over a store on Broadway,
near Fourth street. To-day the mem
bers of the "mother church" of Ala
meda County gathered to celebrate the
golden jubilee of the establishment of
the first Episcopal house of worship on
the eastern shore of San Francisco
Bay.
At an early hour this morning cor
porate communion was celebrated, and
many former members of St. John's
who have moved away from the parish
attended the service. Particularly was
this service a memorial to the Rev.
Benjamin Akerlyâ"Father" Akerly, as
he was lovingly called by the older
membersâw % ho for forty years was rec
tor of St. John's. The communion ser
vice was conducted by the Rev. Edward
F. Gee, rector of St. John's Church, as
sisted by the Rev. H. B. Monges. At
the close of the communion service the
Rev. Charles T. Walkley, rector of St.
Paul's Church, addressed the congre
gation, giving a testimonial of appre
ciation of the great work of Dr. Akerly.
The principal service of the Jubilee
celebration was held at 11 a. m., when
Tours' communion office was sung by a
full chorus choir. Communion was cel
ebrated by the Rev. E. F. Gee, assisted
by the Rev. S. J. Lee as epistoler and
the Rev. David McClure as gospeler.
Dr. McClure preached the dedicatory
sermon at the opening of the present
church, which was erected after the
destruction of the old church by fire in
1896. On this occasion the sermon was
a memorial to Father Akerly. At the
close of the communion service to-day
the Rev. William A. Brewer, registrar
of the diocese, preached the jubilee ser
mon.
RECALLS EARLY DAYS. .
Taking as his text the prayer of Solo
mon at the dedication of the temple.
Dr. Brewer spoke briefly of this the
supreme moment In the life of the
mightiest of Israel's Kings, after which
he said:
It is in just such spirit, I am sure, that
this congregation is gathered to-day. just fifty
years after the founding of St. John's parish,
to recall the memories of the days of old. We
bring to mind the early days of the parish, of
this diocese and of this State. And in the
history of our church on the Paclflo Coast, St.
John's parish Is indeed a pioneer. Of all the
California parishes only three precede Itâ
Trinlu- of .San Francisco, organized on July
22. 1X49; Qraee of San FranciÃco, organized
on April 28, 1850, and St. John's of Stockton,
organized on August 25, 1850. Fourth on this
roll of honor comes St. John's of Oakland, or
ganized January 8, 1855.
And now comes the natural question, "Who
read the church service for the first time un
der due and formal church authority in Oak
land?" When I tell you that It was Bishop
KiD our thoughts will recall with deep affec
tion the stately form and noble features of the
first Bishop of California. In his Journal
Bishop Kip says: "On Wednesday, Novem
ber 15. 1864, I went to Oakland for the pur
pose of making arrangements for the estab
lishment of a church. Owing to some mis
take, notice had not been given for service
on that evening, and I could only take meas
ures by personal conference with the members
of the church residing in that place."
Later on we read In the Journal: "On De
cember 17 I again visited Oakland, where a
commodious room had been arranged for di
vine service. My object was to hold the first
service in this place, which I did. reading;
prayers and preaching morning and after
noon."

YEAR BREAKS
ALL RECORDS
More New Buildings Erected
in Oakland in 1904. Than
in Any Previous Year
NEWCOMERS ARE BUYING
Large Real Estate Deal Made
and Improvements Under
Way at Point Richmond
Oakland Office San Franclsce Call,
1016 Broadway, Jan. 8.
Nearly 1000 new buildings, aggre
gating in value more than $4,000,000,
have been erected In Oakland during
1804. Of these, real estate dealers say
that fully one-third have been built
by newcomers to the city. More than
$1,000,000 has been Invested in new
buildings at the University of Califor
nia, and this, with the other opera
tions throughout the county, will
bring the total cost of new buildings
erected In Alameda County during
1904 close to $6,000,000.
This record eclipses that of any year
in the history of the city by many
thousands of dollars, and the present
outlook indicates that the opening
year will be fully as good as that just
closed, if not better.
Councilman W. J. Baccus, who is
president of the local Bricklayers"
Union, is engaged in the preparation
Of tiie new building ordinance, in
this work he has carefully estimated
the amount of building work done in
the last year. He estimates the cost
of new structures at $4,000,000. Other
men who have been interested in the
subject place the amount at nearly*
$5,000,000.
SALES TO NEWCOMERS.
Local real estate dealers report
that the market has not yet resumed
its wonted activity, but as a quiet sea
son was anticipated after the holidays,
this has not aroused any surprise. The
principal business done during the
opening week has been in small resi
dence properties, a majority of the
sales of the week having been made
to recent arrivals from the Bast and
from other parts of the State. Sev
eral real estate men report that since
the beginning of the year they have
received many inquiries as to the
prices of property in Oakland, and
dealers generally are satisfied that
1905 will be the banner yeaj* for this
city.
A. J. Snyder recently removed his
office from Ninth street to the build
ing formerly occupied by the Contra
Costa Water Company. Mr. Snyder
Is well satisfied with the present con
dition of the market and expects a
busy year. He says:
Indications during the last month, culminat
ing in this week's inquiries, show that the de
mand for Investment properties is on the In
close. In advance It Is safe to predict that
there will be a larger percentage of increase
in Oakland's population during the next year
than during the last. This population must
have homes and as a result even the most
conservative will be compelled to admit that
Oakland- has outdone any previous year.
George H. Lee, who has been asso
ciated with Henry Z. Jones buying
tracts of land and laying them out into
suburban settlements, has just con
cluded the purchase of eighty-three
acres close to the new boulevard, on
the south line and fronting on the east
line of the High street driveway 2000
feet. It is now being put in shape for
sale. It is within the 5-cent fare of two
electric car lines. Those knowing the
section and its present advantages are
congratulating Mr. Lee in securing
such a choice piece of land.
The West Berkeley Improvement Club
has elected the following officers: Pres
ident, Nels Olsen; vice president,
George Grimehaw; secretary, Fred
Hearst; sergeant-at-arms, F. Lane.
AT POINT RICHMOND.
POINT RICHMOND, Jan. B.âOne of
the most Important real estate deals of
the new year was the purchase of
twelve acres of land, a part of the Lu
cas ranch, which is situated on the
main line of the Santa Fe Railroad. The
purchasers of the tract are J. B. Har
ris and D. L. Isgrigg of Berkeley, and
the price paid was $12,000. It is under
stood that the tract will at once be sub
divided into residence lots and placed
on the market.
George C. Henley has Just purchased
the real estate and Insurance business
of H. A. Johnson. Mr. Henley now has
the largest real estate business in Point
Richmond. His offices are located on
Macdonald avenue.
The grading on the line of the East
Shore and Suburban Railroad is now
completed and the work of laying the
track is progressing rapidly. It is ex
pected that the road will be In opera
tion by the middle of February. The
road will connect with the lines of the
Oakland Traction Company. ,
MILLIONAIRE MURRAY
DYING AT ST. FRANCIS
Hemorrhage of the Brain and Par
alysis Brings Montana Banker
Within the Shadow of Death.
Death is hovering about the bedside
of James H. Murray, a millionaire
mining man and banker of Montana,
who has been a guest at the St. Fran
cis Hotel for the last week. On
Wednesday the unfortunate man had
a hemorrhage of the brain and par
alysis followed. Since then he has
been sinking rapidly and last evening
the attending physicians, Drs. Rich
ter, Rosenthal and Nfewmark, enter
tained little hope for their patient's
recovery.
Mr. Murray has not been in good
health for a number of years, and
this fact has caused him and his wife
to spend a great deal of their time
in San Francisco, where they found
the climate more congenial to his con
dition than in Montana. About eight
months ago he purchased the hand
some home of the late Hugh Tevis at
Monterey, where he and his wife have
since been spending much of their
time. The couple came up from Mon
terey two days before he was stricken
down. Murray is one of the best
known , men In Montana, where he
made his immense fortune.

SECRETARY OF HIBERNIA
BANK ILL AT HIS HOME
Sickness of Robert J. Tobln Causes
Concern Among His Friends and
Employes.
Robert J. Tobln, secretary of the
Hibernia Savings and Loan Society,
has been dangerously 111 at his home,
1380 Geary street, for several days.
His condition last, night was somewhat
improved, but he is not yet out of
danger. Though the news of his ill
ness was not noised abroad, Mr. Tobln
has been missed from his office at the
Hibernia Bank and his friends knew
that nothing but illness would keep
him away.
Robert J. Tobln has filled the office
of secretary of the Hibernia Savings
and Loan Society since its creation in
1878. Though the well-known banker
is well along In years, his friends are
confident that he will recover. He
was near to death several years ago,
but recovered after hope had been
abandoned. He Is being attended by
Dr. C. W. Montgomery.
DILIGENT SEARCH FAILS
TO DISCLOSE A MAFIA
Man Who Sent Threatening Letters to
Hungarian Premier Found to Be
Well Educated.
LEBANON, Pa,, Jan. 8.â Diligent
search of the foreign settlement here
to-day failed to throw any additional
light on the existence of a Mafia, or
"black hand," society in this city. It
was learned, however, that Ignace
Wanzler, who was arrested here yes
terday by secret operatives and who
confessed to having sent two threat
ening letters to Count Stephen Tisza,
the Austrian Premier, is well edu
cated. From several of Wansler's
countrymen who admitted acquain
tance with him it was learned that
Wanzler received weekly large
amounts of mail.
Epilepsy
Can be cured. To those afflicted this
conveys a wonderful message. Though
aulte common, it is only a short time
since it was considered Incurable. The
discovery that it was purely a nervous
disorder has led to the application of the
great nerve restorer,
Dr. Miles'
Restorative Nervine
With the happy result that thousands
have been completely cured, and others
are being cured every day.
"In the year '92 I was stricken with
epilepsy. Doctors treated me for several
years, but I grew worse. I would have
sueh 1 awful fits. I cannot tell my awful
sufferings. A druggist recommended Dr.
Miles' Nervine and I bought a bottle and
found it helped me, and I took three
more and am cured. I had only one light
spell after I commenced taking It. Pdo
hope the time will come when everybody
will know that your medicine cures these
awful fits."âJOHN LEW 19, Clarion. Pa.
Dr. Miles' Nervine is sold under a
guarantee that your druggist will refund
your money if first bottle does not ben
efit.TERM OFFERED
IS TOO SHORT
Thomas F. Egan Declines to
Accept a Place in the
Board of Pnblic Works
FULL TIME OR NOTHING
Appointee Says He Expected
to Serve for Three Years,
but Mayor Proffered One
Thomas F. Egan, one of the recent
appointees of Mayor Schmitz, has de
clined the office of Commissioner of
Public Works. When the offer was
made to him he understood that the
term of office would be for the full
time, three years, and on that condi
tion he was willing to act as one of the
Commissioners. Yesterday morning,
however, when he learned that he was
appointed to act for only one year he
threw up the job and promptly inti
mated to the Mayor that it was to be
for three years or nothing. The Mayor
was taken somewhat aghast when he
learned that Egan would not take the
job.
It is understood the Mayor hopes to
adjust the matter in some way to in
duce Egan to rescind his action. Egan,
in speaking of the matter, said:
I have declined to aocept the office as one of
the Commissioners of Public "Works offered to
me by Mayor Schmitz. It had been my inten
tion to accept tho position until this momins.
when I learned that, instead of the office run
ning for the full term, I was to be appointed
for only one year. This was Indicated In
my formal noUoe of appointment, which I re
ceived this morning. I at once telephoned to
Mayor Schmitz that I could not accept the po
sition on these terms.
â¢ When the matter had been discussed previ
ously between the Mayor and myself I had al
ways supposed the appointment wet Id be for
three years, to fill the place of Miohael Casey.
Upon these conditions, as chairman of the La
bor Union County Committee. I was willing to
take the position. It was never intimated to
me that the office would be other than for the
'full term.
I declined the offer of Mayor Schmlta In no
spirit of vlndietlvecess whatever. When I tele
.phoned to the Mayor tills morning and gave
him my declination he had very little to say
in reply. I believe certain exigencies had
arisen which made a change in his programme.
I do not know what they were, but I think I
have an idea. I have no feeling ot any ani
mosity whatever against the Mayor.
In speaking of the unexpected ac
tion of Egan in throwing up the billet
offered to him, Mayor Schmitz last
night said:
â¢I have received no formal communication
from Mr. Egan in regard to his declination of
.the office I offered to him. It is true that
'there seems to have been some misunderstand
ing between Mr. Egan and myself as to the
t<>rm of the office. He expected, evidently,
thai his appointment would be for three years.
Ithope the matter can be satisfactorily adjust
er!. Cntil I receive a formal notice from him
that he will not act I can do nothing.
SHOWERS KEEP PLEASURE
SEEKERS WITHIN DOORS
Kain Drenches the Garments of Those
Who Refused to Take Weather
Prophet's Tip.
A celestial shower bath opened un
heralded upon the city yesterday,
catching many pleasure-seekers In
their Sunday-go-to-meetings and
drenching the glad rags.
The greater portion of the coast felt
â¢ the effects of the downpour. The rain
started just as the crowds were mak
ing their weekly pilgrimage to the
j.ark music stand. Professor McAdie,
who keeps a census of clouds and
winds, gave out that showers would
probably fall before night. The wise
ones who preferred to "dope" the
cloudlets themselves suffered in con
sequence.
Other than a few mud splashes on
dainty lingerie and chiffons no dam
age was done by the rain in this city.
Found Dead in Jail.
SAN JOSE, Jan. B.âAn old man
named Charles Brink was found dead
in his cell in the County Jail this
morning, death evidently being due to
heart failure, superinduced by exces
sive drinking. Brink was brought here
from Mountain View on Friday under
sentence on a charge of disturbing the
peace.
When one is afflicted with rheumatism,
to obtain relief as speedily as possible is

night. Cressy's sketches are always
good, for there is something in his droll
humor, tempered as it is at unexpected
intervals with a promise of a bit of
pathos, that holds one in anticipation
of the climax with all that human con
centration can well afford to spare on
a one-act comedy. Blanche Dayne
lends Cressy an able support. "Town
Hall To-night" is the title of the sketch,
and it introduces Cressy as Hip Flitters,
a typical crossroad theatrical manager.
Miss Dayne, who represents Miss Gene
vieve Montmorency, arrives on the
scene as "leading lady of a traveling
troupe." The dialogue that develops
after her appearance at "Town Hall"
is cleverly maintained by Miss Dayne. !
It gives Cressy opportunity to dovetail !
into the situation his own inimitable
absurdities. It is sufficient to say that
Cressy's work was the hit of the even
ingâan evening of clever things at
that, which made it difficult to choose
between them from a standpoint of im- j
partialism.
Josle Kine and Phil Gotthold in "A j
Medical Discovery" were somewhat of ,
a disappointment, but their sketch did
apt admit of much good stage business, j
Winfield Douglas and Margie Ford j
caught the house with some pleasing I
songs and clever dancing, and Miss j
Nita Allen and Robert Eliott in "Wine, j
Women and Song" are well worth see- i
ing. Miss Allen is an actress of merit
and created something out of a very
superficial act. Eliott wears well
throughout the dialogue, and tha piece
was received with marked appreciation
by the Sunday-nighters.

RAILWAY TIME CARDS
SOMETIMES CONFUSING
Passing From One Standard District
to Another Sets the Clock
Back.
An official of a railway running
through West "Virginia tells of an amus
i ing conversation between the conduc-
I tor of one of the company's trains
j running to Parkersburg and a pas
i senger, whose nervousness indicated
| that he was not accustomed to the
! vagaries of the train schedules.
Said the passenger: "Mr. Conduc
j tor, what time do we get into Parkers
burg?"
"Ten-twenty."
"Good. Now, at what hour can I get
a train there for the West?"
"Nine-twenty."
"To-morrow?"
"No. To-night."
At this the nervous passenger began
to evince signs of indignation. "Look
here, conductor," exclaimed he, "I'm
no fooi, you know. Cut out this jok
ing and tell me at what hour I can
get a train for the West."
"At nine-twenty to-night," reiterated
the imperturbable official, preparing
to pass on.
"Hold on a minute," grasped the
passenger, catching the conductor by
the sleeves. "Will you please tell me
how I am to leave Parkersburg one
hour before I arrive there?"
"Simply by keeping your seat and
not getting excited," was the calm
reply. "You'll get your train all
right."
The problem was too much for the
nervous passenger. He gazed help
lessly about him as if seeking light on
the subject from his fellow passengers.
Then, turning to the conductor, he ob
served :
"Now, old man, I haven't the least
doubt that you are a rattling good con
ductor and know your business from A
to Z: but I'll not admit that you can
work a reversing lever on the sun."
At this the conductor smiled. "I
don't mind telling you," he said, "that
the time changes at the river."
Whereupon all became clear to the
nervous passenger.
"Oh. I see!" he exclaimed, exultantly.
"At this rate, if I go on to San Fran
cisco, I'll get there some time last
week."âNew York Tribune.
STRENUOUS TRAVELING
CATCHES OCEAN LINER
One Passenger Chases the Majestic
on a Tug and Is Finally Taken
Aboard.
James Montgomery Smart, who has
an office in the Produce building, de
cided at the last minute that the would
go to England on the White Star line
steamship Majestic, and was the prin
cipal in an exciting chase down the
river the other morning after the de
parting liner. Incidentally about sev
enty-five persons remained in the bit
ing wind on the end of the dock watch
ing the tug in her efforts to get along
side tho big ship.
Mr. Smnrt. it was said, had been un
certain whether he could get off on the
Majestic. A friend was on the pier
waiting for him with a dress suit case.
This attracted the attention of some of
the officers, and he was told to get on
board quickly if he wanted to go.
"I am not going; I am waiting for
a friend and I do not kpow for certain
whether he is going." he said.
Three minutes after the Majestic had
left her dock and the friend had given
up his watch a cab containing Mr.
Smart arrived. He was assisted out
and his baggage thrown on a hand
truck. There was some quick time
made in getting to the end of the dock
end in signaling a tug. Shose who were
about to leave returned to the string
piece to watch the outcome of his ef
forts to continue Ins trip to Liverpool.
The vessel had pointed her nose down
stream when the tug, with her whistle
going, started after her. It was not
until the liner had reached the Bat
ten' that she consented to slow down
so that Mr. Smart and his baggage
could be hauled on board.
Another passenger got down Just as
the gangplanks were being taKen
down, and It was only through the
courtesy of the superintendent, Mr.
Bennel. that, he was taken on board.
The man came down from Montreal,
arriving at the Grand Central depot

repeated J. V. Ladd, the shoe sales
man, after me. "Well, I don't suppose
I would be in any better position than
any one else had it not been for the
fact that a few days ago a couple of
ladies, customers of my place, were
discussing that very point and their
deductions appear to solve the riddle
perfectly.
"It is not that a woman's shoe laces
will not tie in as firm a knot as any
other; the reason for the frequent an
noyances to which women are sub
jected is apart from that. In the case
of high shoes the trouble is altogether
in the height. The shoe laces farther
up on the leg than a man's, usually
fits more snugly, and therefore en
counters a greater strain on the knot
when a woman walking. The re
sult is that it becomes loosened within
a very short time, whereas a man may
walk all day without the laces of his
shoe becoming untied. Where low
shoes are worn the skirts flapping
around the ankle do the work of
loosening the knot."âSt. Louis Globe-

GRATEFUL GIRL KISSES
OLD SENATOR CULLOM
Galesburg Miss Travels to Washington
ton to Keep Soldier Lover From
Philippines.
Senator Cullom received a hearty
kiss from a pretty girl in the room of
the Senate Committee on Foreign Re
lations recently.
The girl was Miss Minnie Swigert
of GalesbOrg, who had saved up $120
with which to purchase the freedom
of her sweetheart, John Pierce, who Is
a private in the Hospital Corps of the
United States army.
This money was deposited with the
proper authorities. Pierce looked for
ward to his discharge In time to marry
Miss Swigert during the holidays. He
was thunderstruck therefore the other
day when he received orders to leave
with his company for.the Philippines.
He wired the news to his sweetheart
and that young woman promptly came
all the way from Galesburg to Wash
ington to see Senator Cullom about it.
Miss Swigert went to the room of
the Committee on Foreign Relations,
interrupting Senator Cullom while he
was poring over the treaties pending
with foreign countries. She told him
her story and Senator Cullom took up
the telephone, rang up Surgeon Gen
eral O'Reilly and pleaded for the sol
dier lover.
"Don't send him to the Philippines,
general," pleaded Senator Cullom.
The girl's face was deadly pale and
she was intensely agitated. CUtlom
turned from the telephone and said:
"That matter is all arranged."
"What!" exclaimed the girl, jump
ing from her chair. "Isn't he going
to the Philippines?" N
"No, he'll stay at home."
"Oh, you dear old man," gasped the
maiden, leaping into Senator Cullom's
arms and giving him a hearty kiss.
"You dear, dear old man."
Then she ran from the room, it not
being long before Private John Pierce,
Hospital Corps, received a message
from the capitol telegraph office.
Senator Cullom turned to his secre
tary.
"Billy," he said, "I guess that's
enough for one day. We won't go
over those treaties any further." â

THIRD AND MARKET STREETS, SAN FRANCISCO
MONDAY JANUARY t. _1>0Â»
FIRST WEEK OF THE NEW TRADE YEAR.
WHILE general business is quiet, as usual during the first
half of January, conditions are visibly much better than at
this time last year. Then we were facing a recession in
trade, coupled with a conservatism full of timidity, with apprehen
. sions of a reaction. That reaction did appear and lasted for six
â  months, and it was not until June that the tide again turned toward
renewed activity, since which we have steadily gone upward, finally
closing the year at a slight advance over the preceding year. This
retrospect has already been dwelt upon in this column and needs
no further specification.
The features under which we enter upon 1905 are the bounteous
â¢crops of corn and cotton last year, increased railway earnings, light
stocks of almost all commodities, showing that production has not
â¢ yet overlapped consumption, continued expansion in the iron and
steel trades, the full employment of mill machinery, no idle labor
of any consequence and no serious labor controversies, improving
conditions in the winter wheat crop, which is looking very well, more
numerous arrivals of buyers in all the large markets, continued gains
in the country's bank clearings, fewer failures than at thÂ«Â£ time last
year, and none of them serious, enormous stocks of money with low
'â¢ . rates of interest, easy collections and a widespread feeling of opti
â¢ mism in strong contrast with the pessimism which existed at this
time last year. All these conditions point to good times during the
coming year. A few of them may vanish, but it is hardly possible
that all will; hence the confident predictions of the great bankers
â and financiers of the country that we are to enjoy another period
of prosperity seem to have a solid foundation.
The demand for all sorts of productions is certainly remarkable.
"Our mines are turning out immense quantities of gold, silver, iron
and copper to meet immediate requirements, and the three last
metals have lately made marked advancements in price. The condi
tion of the steel market is a good illustration of the state of the
metal trade. During the first half of 1904 the industry was so de
pressed that the production fell to the rate of 12,000,000 tons per
year, whereas it is now back again to the high water mark of 19,
000.000, or an increase of over 50 per cent. This is a most excellent
and encouraging exhibit and speaks #ell for the future. We are
now producing pig iron faster than Great Britain, France and Ger
many combined, while our copper production is at least 10 per cent
. larger than last year. Nor is this all. Iron, copper, tin, lead, rubber,
wool, drugs, chemicals and a long list of farm and factory staples
are selling considerably higher than a year ago, simply because con
' sumption is still ahead of production, and as long as this condition
lasts times cannot be otherwise than active and good. The only great
staple selling lower than a year ago is cotton, which has declined to
the cost of production and even below it, under what is probably the
largest crop ever known.
On December 1 the supply of money in the United States was
$2,573,000,000, against $2,449,000,000 on the same date the preceding
\-ear. This is a pretty fair bank account to contemplate. Another
good condition which all sensible citizens will indorse is that during
1904 the total industrial consolidations, as closely as could be esti
' mated, aggregated only about $185,000,000, against $425,000,000 in
1903. $1,122,000,000 in 1902 and $2,805,000,000 in 1901. Evidently
the "trust mania" is waning, as far-seeing financiers predicted it
would as far back as 1901, even while it was at its most acute stage,
as shown by the above figures. Every evil, whatever may be its
character, contains within itself the germs of its own destruction.
. which fructify and destroy it when it has reached its limit. This is
the law of the universe and it cannot be evaded. Every habitual
malefactor eventually lands in jail somewhere or other.
.Another point: The net result of our foreign commerce during
â¢ the first eleven months of 1904 was an excess of exports amounting
â¢ â  to $366,000,000, which has never been exceeded, except in 1903, when
'. : the balance in our favor reached $392,000,000 for the same period.
â¢ These figures speak for themselves.
The above enumerations show in a broad and general way the
â  commercial and financial condition of the United States. It was
.. never better. We have never yet gone into a new year with fairer
prospects. What may happen later on no man can foresee; but up to
date we are still on the crest of the wave of prosperity.
THE SOUYTH'S FIGHT FOR LAW.
IN the current number of McClure's Magazine Ray Stannard Baker
contributes an article upon "Lynching in the South," which by
its impartiality of spirit and soundness of deductions commends
.itself to thinking people. At present time, when the public officials,
the press and the people of the whole South are making a desperate
stand against the excesses of mob rule, a review of the situation such
as that set forth by this writer cannot but call attention to the diffi
culty of the problem facing the people of the South and emphasize
the progress they have already made. â¦
Mr. Baker reflects the sentiment of the Southerner who would
countenance a lynching even while deprecating the violation of the
law. The fault lies partly with the negro himself and partly with
the courts of justice according to this authority. In the far South
there is a class of the colored race, little known to the North and
never seen in the Westâthe worthless, vagrant negro; he it is that
shuns work, prowls the roads for plunder, listens often to the in
cendiary harangues of colored preachers, and hesitates not to give
himself over to the commission of the unspeakable crimes that are
so often the motive for a lynching. This negro is shunned by the
better class of his own race and treated by the whites in sparsely set
tled districts as a predatory animal, to be feared. There is no race
prejudice to act as inspiration for retaliation on the part of the
whites against lawless negroes of this class; it is a question of pro
tection purely.
A general distrust of the efficacy of courts finds deep lodgment
iij the Southerner's convictions according to Baker. Particularizing,
the writer says: "The Alabama system of justice is cursed by the
professional juror, chosen by politicians and often open to political
influences. This, with the unlimited right of appeal and the great
.number of peremptory challenges allowed to the defense in accepting
jurymen, gives such power to the lawyers for the defendent that con
victions are exceedingly difficult." As a result of this laxity the
feeling is prevalent that somehow the lawyers will cheat justice and
the sentiment of an outraged community is too likely to forestall
the.impotency of the courts by mob justice.
But with the closer knitting together of the sparsely settled dis
tricts and with the growing unanimity of spirit among those whose
pride of State cannot tolerate further lawlessness the lynching prob
lem in the South is rapidly finding its solution. And, as Mr. Baker
trenchantly says, "The South has no lessons to learn from the North
in so far as the lynching problem is concerned." The South, he as
sures us, in making fully as creditable progress against its special
evils of lawlessness as the North. It is not incumbent upon those
above Mason and Dixon's line to draw any pharisaical comparisons.
WORD comes from Stockton that the Chamber of Commerce
of that city, now entering upon the fifth year of its activities,
purposes raising its membership of 500 to 1000 in order that
the rapidly broadening interests of the city of the San Jdaquin may
receive adequate direction and promotion at the hands of its cor
' porate businessmen. This enterprise on the part of the Chamber
of Commerce is specially commendable at this time, when the wave
of prosperity is at the flood throughout the whole State. What with
the plans for flood lands reclamation and the increased facilities for
river transportation that will accrue therefrom, Stockton seems to
have a sure position in the broad thoroughfare of progress and its
Chamber of Commerce is assured plenty of employment for the
future.

The Moon's Craters and
What Then Send
Forth in Eruption
IF there be craters on the moon that
are anything- but extinct, they must
expel something. Judged by the
discharges of our earthly vol
canoes, that something must be
water and carbonic acia gas. Water
cannot possibly exist as a liquid; for
the temperature of the moon's surface
during the long lunar night is probably
not far from 460 degrees below the zero
mark of a Fahrenheit thermometer.
Ice and snow are the forms, then,
which lunar water must assume. Is
there any evidence of it? Hundreds
of "craterlets" are lined with a silvery
coating that gleams dazzlingly when
the sun shines full upon them. Cap
ping the loftier peaks the same silver
glow may be seen. On tlie slopes of
the greater mountain chains, on the
ramparts of huge craters the silvery
sheen casts its halo, fading away
strangely as the sun rises higher and
higher, and reappearing at sunset just
before the long, cold lunar night sets
in. From many of the craters, notably
from Tycho, long white rays spread
out for hundreds of milesâenigmas in
the old moon of a generation ago, but
in the new moon of to-day deep
crevices illuminated only when the sun
is high in the lunar heavens. What
is this silvery substance that caps the
Apennines of the moon, gleams on the
slopes and radiates from the craters?
According to the new school it is
simply ice and snow, collecting at the
poles, on summits, and in the very
places where it ought to collect. More
over, It partly explains the curious
changes that occur at different times
of the lunar day in the size of the
crater Linne, the "very dmall, round,
brilliant spot," previously mentioned;
it explains the illumination of deep,
snow-bottomed pits and abysses that
are inky black at sunrise and sunset,
and brilliantly white when the sun
shines directly into them; and it ex
plains the fading away and reappear
ance of white stains at different
periods in the lunar day. The melting
and falling of snow, the disappearance
and reappearance of hoar frost, alone
can account for these changes. In old
descriptions they are said to be due to
variations in illumination; In the phil
osophy of the new moon they are
attributed with beautiful simplicity to
the alternate evaporation and freezing
of water expelled from craters, in
eruption.âWaldemar B. Kaempffert in
the December Booklovers

REAL FRENLED FINANCE
The president of the National Bank
of Allthetin sat in his private office.
The door opened and John D. Rocke
feller was ushered in.
"Good morning," said the president,
"what can I do for you?"
"I want to borrow $42 50," replied
Rockefeller.
"On what security?"
"Standard Oil," was the reply.
The president of the bank shook his
head. "Not good enough," he said,
firmly, adding, "please don't bane the
door as you go out."
**Â»**Â»
A few minutes later a veiled woman
entered the office of the president.
"I want to borrow $1,250,000." she
whispered.
"Have you any security?" asked the
president. "Merely as a matter of
form, I assure you," he hastened to
add, as he thought he detected signs of
weeping behind his visitor's veil.
"Oh, do you want security?" asked
the wiman. "Give me a piece of paper
and a pen."
She wrote a few words and presented
the paper to the president.
"Ah, Carnegie's note for $5,000,000!"
he exclaimed. "Are you sure the sig
nature is genuine?"
"Sure," responded the mysterious
stranger, "didn't you see me write it?"
"Certainly,, certainly. A million and
a quarter, I think you said. Nothing
more to-day? No? Glad to oblige you
at any time. Good day; don't forget
the number."âPortland Oregonian.
Fraud in Gun -Barrels.
In his annual report on the trade of
Belgium Consul General Hertslet
remarks that a large quantity of gun
barrels are sent annually from Liege
to Birmingham to be tested, in order
that they may have the Birmingham
mark. They are then sent back to be
finished and made up at Liege, and
are frequently sold as British guns.
This would be avoided, says the En
gineer of London, if all gun barrels
manufactured at Liege were marked
"Made in Belgium" before being ac
cepted for proof in Birmingham.
Fine Distinction Drawn.

drawn by the Venetian shopkeeper who

CAPTAIN'S BRAVE LITTLE WIFE
AIDS CREW OF SINKING SHIP
IT was the encouragement of a brave little woman that
kept the almost demoralized crew of the British bark
entine Stewiacke from deserting their post at the
pumps when the vessel filled with water and drifted
for five days in the Atlantic Ocean.
The heroine was Mrs. Mabel Airey, wife of the Stew
iacke's captain, and she gave her account of the thrilling
experiences through which she passed to a Philadelphia
Inquirer reporter while seated in the cabin of the Aus
trian steamer Lucia, which took Mrs. Airey with the crew
from the sinking vessel and brought them to port.
Mrs. Airey is but a slip of a woman, with blue eyes,
light hair, and small, regular features. She seems no more
than 28 years old. She has accompanied her.husband on
many voyages and she can keep a logbook and use nau
tical terms with the facility of an old salt. She said:
"We left NoVn Scoha for Eurore in September We
took on a cargo of salt at Cadis, Spain, and left thore f<>r
Yarmouth. Nova Scotia, on November 1". Besides my
husband and myself, we had on board the Stewuv-ke, the
mate, the cook, thÂ«; boatswain and five able seamen. We
had fair weather for ten days, but on Sunday, November
2~, we encountered a terrific gale. The vessel strained
under the battering of the waves and before long we
found that some ti the sef.ms had opened and fourteen
inches of water was cominer in every hour.
"The captain ordered the men to the pumps, and from
that time until Friday afternoon, December 2, when we
sighted the Lucia, only one man was permitted to leave
the pumps at a time to rest. In the five days my husband
slept but a half hour. Water poured in fore and aft and
the messroom was washed out completely. We were then
al cut 2( 0 mib s norn the nearest land, St. Marys island,
one of the Azores.
"My husband ordered the oil bags thrown over, and it
was this precaution that saved us, for the oil greater re
duced the force if the waves. About 9 o'clock at night thi
waves carried away the wheel ropes. Fortunately the
captain was at the wheel and was able to hold it while
ONLY WAITING.
The Hon. John Sharp Williams,
leader of the minority in the House of
Representatives, says that one day
while leisurely driving down a road
near his home town in Mississippi he
observed a darky reclining under a
tree near the roadside. The negro was
gazing lazily up through the branches
of the tree, and a hoe lay beside him.
In the cornfield adjoining the road
there could be seen. Mr. Williams
states, many weeds impeding the
growth of the grain.
"What are you doing there, Sam?"
asked Mr. Williams.
"I'se heah to hoe dat corn, sah," was
the answer.
"Then what are you doing under the
tree âresting?"

MRS. MABEL AIREY.
one of the seamen brought fresh ropes, or we would have
all gone to the bottom.
"On Monday the sailors came to my husband and asked
him to put into the nearest port. There was three feet
of water in the hold. The men seemed demoralized and
I did what I could to cheer them. I told them that I
would take a hand at the pumps if it became necessary.
"They went back to the pumps and worked steadily
through the storm. On Tuesday they again asked my
husband to head for the nearest port. He said it was
useless. In the afternoon they again asked him and he
turned the bow of the vessel toward the Canary Islands.
But the wind blew the vessel out of the course and the
sailors saw that it was impossible to reach land. They
told my husband that as soon as a vessel was sighted they
would refuse to go on duty, and he promised to abandon
the Stewiacke as soon as a ship came in view.
"For three days more we tossed about in the Atlantic.
The sailors were exhausted from the long strain and lack
of sleep. I encouraged them all I could, but they were
on the point of giving up. We were all resigned to die,
for we felt sure that no help would reach us In time.
The head of the vessel was almost under the sea and
there were five feet of water in the hold. On Friday
afternoon Seaman Neils Jacobson sighted the Lucia. We
raised distress signals and we feared that the vessel would
not see us.' But we soon saw it coming toward us. We
launched a boat and sent all hands, with the exception of
my husband, the boatswain and myself, to the Lucia.
"The boat returned for us and I packed up some of
my belongings. Then we abandoned the Stewiacke. Cap
tain Zacevich has been most kind to us, supplying our
every want. He gave us the best he had on his vessel."
Although Mrs. Airey modestly referred to her part in
keeping up the spirits of the crew, they declared that
they would have given up hope and gone to the bottom
of the sea if it had not been for her smiles and encour
agement. Wilfrid Powell, the British Consul, took charge
of Captain Airey, his wife and the crew, and arranged
to send them to Nova Scotia.
BABY'S GRAMMAR.
I know a young grammarian.
She's only three feet high,
And yet she conjugates a verb
With far more sense than I.
For when I asked her, "Did you go?**
Her words by logic sent
Are heard in answer: "Yes, I goed."
(She never says "I went.")
She's only four, yet with the verbs
She never has a doubt;
The ones that have a crooked twist
She promptly straightens out.
And rules the grammar sharps revere
Get shocks both swift and rudeâ
She never, never says "I did."
She always says "I doed."
With be and was and being been,
With see and saw and seen,
With go and went and going gone,
With meaning meant and meanâ
I often wish that at the start
Some four-year-old Hortense
Had goed to making grammar rules
And doed the thing with sense!

Rich Woman and Her
Beautiful Daughter
to Enter a Convent
AFTER careful consideration cov
ering a period of several years
Mme. Constance Mahlman and
her accomplished daughter, Ma
rie, of Grymes Hill, Tompkinsville, Sta
ten Island, have decided to renounce
the world and devote the rest of their
lives to the Roman Catholic church.
Mother and daughter will enter a con
vent in the spring.
Mme. Mahlman has been a resident
of Staten Island for many years, and
her large estate on Grymes Hill is one
of the beauty snots of Staten Island.
Four years ago Mme. Mahlman sur
prised her numerous friends by donat
ing a large parcel of land adjoining her
home to the Sisters of the Visitation, a
cloistered order. The sisters had a con
vent at Jamaica, L.. 1., but at once be
gan the erection of a convent on the
property deeded to them by Mme. Mahl
man. Mme. Mahlman at that time ex
pressed her intention of entering tha
convent with her daughter, but certain
formalities had to be gone through and
she abandoned the idea for the time.
The church and convent were partly
completed when the sisters found that
being a cloistered order they would bo
unable to maintain themselves and
abandoned the work of erecting th<;
buildings. The property was returmd
to Mme. Mahlman.
At this time the Rev. H. J. Murphy.
O. S. A., of Villanova College, Phila
delphia, was looking for a place to es
tablish a church and college of the
Augustinian order and selected this
property. He purchased the land and
half-completed buildings from Mme.
Mahlman and soon completed the build
ings.
Mme. Mahlman is a member of the
German nobility and Is in receipt of a
large Income from her estates in Ger
many. Her beautiful daughter, Marie,
has shared with her mother her devo
tion to religion and was rarely seen in
society. Mme. Mahlman is a strikingly
handsome woman of about 50 years.
Her daughter is about 25 years old.
Two years ago burglars entered their
home and after chloroforming all the
inmates ransacked the house. Mme.
Mahlman never fully recovered from
the shock and has been ill at intervals
since. It was her intention to enter the
convent several months ago, but she
suffered an attack of pneumonia and
was obliged to postpone her entry. She
is now recovering and hopes to be able
to carry out her plans early in the
spring.
It is understood that she will turn
over her fortune to the church. Her
mansion on Grymes Hill Is a valuable
property. Since the burglary she has
had armed watchmen stationed about
the place at night and visitors are
warned away. Mother and daughter
are rarely seen in the streets, although
both are regular attendants at the
Church of Our Lady of Good Counsel,
which is less than 100 feet from their
home.

MEET IN SOUTH
RAILROADS OFFER HALF RATE
; TO THE DELEGATES. -
"To Los Angeles in February!" That
is the slogan of the clubs to-day. For
know ye of the unelect that in the
southern city will the hosts of the
State's clubwomen foregather in con
vention. And it promises to be good
fun, too! There are some live topics
t Jin ins up for discussion, among them
â¢iK man question. Not his total exter
mination, exactlyâas clubwomen set a
valuation upon man as an eco
nomic assetâbut upon his exclusion as
jTrom erstwhile women's clubs.,
â¢ In the southland, as everywhere else,
every vigorous club has felt the help
it by its men friends. So far so
â¢g <odl These clubs desire to let down
c bars and let the men in as regular
n embers. Now, here's a pretty state
.Â« :'thingsâboth for the clubs and for
\'he men thereof. For instance, what
would you think of a man who handed
JuU his card bearing the, inscription,
' l*os Angeles Women's ,Ciub"?
Wouldn't you wonder whether he had
his knitting with himâthe dear thing?
As for the clubs themselves, they too
iose characterâthis without reflection
on the men. For if the clubs are
"women's clubs," how in the holy
name of logic can they hold men mem
bers'? Change the clubs' names? Per
haps, but that would mean a revolu
tion in their constitution and by-laws,
and in case of incorporation, a re
incorporation, with its incidental delays
and expenses, would be necessary. Be
sides, eliminating ail these internal
difficulties, the very fact of admitting
men members to the clubs which are
now members of the California Federa
tion would operate to expel the Cali
fornia Federation from the national
body, which stands before the world
unadorned, ornamented or guided by
men.
. But it would seem that the clubs of
the" south are bent upon trying out
ihls novel plan of testifying to their
appreciation of their men- folk. And
thHs is the glove cast into the pit.
Jhf federation meeting, which is to
occupy the first week in February, will
be" quite'the best attended of any on
record, since the railroads are offering
fa ilf-rates from all points about the
"bay, provided 100 tickets be guaran-
And since the announcement has
forth that every clubwoman in
the State is asked to attend the feder
ationânot only the delegates but every
member thereofâthe hair-rate is as
i; member, every clubwoman in the
Si ite is invited to attend the annual
"get-together,** which promises much
â¢of interest in social, civic, economic and
.cultural lines.
' â¢ Mrt. George Law Smith, president of
,the State Federation, has been an offi
cial will-o'-the-wisp during the last
two months, having visited many clubs
in the most remote parts of the State,
an well as those at hand. In these
clybs a charming hospitality was ex
tended the president, whose tact and
personality have won for her an enor
:mous clientele.
â¢ -.There promises to be some good poli
tics-in Los Angeles in February. Just
Watch! But the ballot box is the pride
of'clubwomen. It is the sacredest thing
in: the clubroom ânext to the tea box.
These elections, occurring in clubs, then
ip .district conventions and later in
State gatherings, even if they do let
loose some feminine foolishness, are
educators. They're preparing the way
for-woman's intelligent voting at the
civic polls when the time is ripe for
woman's enfranchisement. And there
are those who think .that the day of
equal rights is not so very far away.
Just what effect, however, the recent
electoral developments in Colorado will
have upon woman's enfranchisement
elsewhere remains to be seen. Here
women were known to "repeat" and to
â¢.stuff." So was it known of men. But
the latter fact didn't cause the country
fee proclaim men as a class unfit to ex
ercise the ballot.
This, too, promises to be threshed out
>p the floor of the convention at Los
A ngeles.

An excellent programme was pre
sented before the department of edu
cation of the California Club at its
regular monthly meeting on Friday
afternoon at the club rooms, Madame
Tojetti, chairman of the department,
1 presiding.
â¢ Frank Bunker of the San Francisco
Normal School was the first speaker,
his subject being "Library Work in the
Public Schools." He told a number of
stories illustrating the need of broader
reading among the teachers and the
pupils, advocating the use of geograph
ical readers in connection with geogra
phy.
Mrs. Angelo of the California Club
spoke on the subject from the club wo
man's point of view. She made an ex
cellent practical address, advising her
hearers to find out what had already
been done by schools and libraries be
fore making plans for work. It was
quite evident that she had already "act
ed upon this advice herself, as she was
ready with references to school and
library work in cities East and West,
with statistics illustrating her points.
She said there should be a permanent
reference library in every school; that
teachers' privileges in the public libra
ries should be extended; that librari
ans should visit the schools, and that
classes should be taken to the libraries
and instructed in the use of references
and of indexes.
Mr. Lichtenstein of the San Francisco
Public Library presented the subject
from the librarian's standpoint. He
said that the chief difficulty in the way
of extending the use of library books
was that of transportation, there be
ing no way of carrying large bundles
or boxes of bookd from library to
school and return except at the teach
ers' own trouble and expense.
The last speaker was Mr. Kimball,
who had visited many libraries and
had a fund of valuable information on
modern library work. He spoke brief
ly, as the hour was late. The entire
programme was full of suggestions of
progressive work that will be under
taken by the California Club.

Mighty Influence in the

Timothy Sullivan, a member of New

"Dry Dollar" Sullivan, a reputation of
being, one of the important political
factors of the big Eastern metropolis,
has been a guest at the Palace Hotel

"Little Tim" controls more votes than
any other man in the great republic,
his influence extending throughout the
territory from Twenty-third street to
the Bowery. He began his career on
the streets of New York, rising from a
bootblack. Although assisted by his
uncle to gain a foothold in politios,
there are many who say that "Little
Tim" would have succeeded without
that aidr and they go even further by
saying that the nephew's shrewdness
and greater amount of intelligence have
materially helped the elder Sullivan in
his own political projects during the
last few years, and also assisted him in
making successful his many private
business enterprises, which Include rac

PEABODY WILL
FILE CONTEST
After Alva Adams Has Taken
Office He Will Try to Re- j
gain the Governorship
SENATE EXPECTS FIGHT
_âÂ»
An Attempt Will Be Made to I
Hold Up the Appointment
of Two Supreme Judges
DENVER, Jan. B.âA hot fight is
â  expected in the Senate when the
; Judges of the Supreme Court appolnt
'ed yesterday by Governor Peabody
! come up for confirmation. The Demo
[ crats held a caucus to-night and at its
conclusion declared that they would
fight the nominations to the Supreme
i bench of Bailey and Goddard with all
! their power. They claim, however,
j that with the Republican Senators,
j Campbell and Delong, voting with
( them they will be able to prevent the
confirmation.
The Republican leaders declared
this afternoon that they had received
personal pledges from enough Repub
lican Senators to insure the confirma
tion of the two men. They were not,
however, overconfident of the issue
and admitted that there would be
something of a fight before the con
firmation was made.
It is Governor Peabody's present in
tention to contest the election of Gov
ernor-elect Adams. Under the law he
cannot file notice of a contest before
the sixth day of the session, which will
be to-morrow. He has, however, sev
eral days in which to file his notice of
contest and he may not do so until
after the Inauguration of Governor
elect Adams.
Adams said to-day:
I do not know whether Governor Peabody
will make a contest or not, but I expect that
he will. I am in a much better position for
such a proceeding now than I was two days
ago. At that time the â¢ investigation was con
fined by the oourt to the city and county of
Denver. Now it includes the whole Stats, and
I feel confident that the Democrats can show
as many fraudulent Republican votes in the
outlying counties as the Republicans) claim
| were cast by the Democrats in Denver.

ESCAPE PUNISHMENT
FOR STRIKING CHINESE
Case Against Redding Yonths Who
Assaulted Celestial After Taking

STEAMER LAKME IS SORRY
SIGHT IN DRYDOCK.
SHOWS,EVIDENCE OF
CONTACT WITH SHOALS
ââ. i
Will Cost $15,000 to Fit Her For Sea
The steam schooner Lakme as she
lies in*he big- drydock at Hunters Point
is a sorry looking spectacle. Her
keel is smashed, her rudder Dost
is broken, she has two great holes
In her** starboard side, her propel
ler is twisted and altogether she is
one of the most demoralized looking
objects that has ever been towed Into
this port, t
As soon as she arrived here she
was towed up to Hunters Point
and an attempt was made to put her
into the small drydock. As she was
drawing twenty-five feet this was
found impossible, so the big dock was
opened up and the practically sub
merged vessel was floated in there. In
this dock, which is 760 feet long, she
occupies but a little corner. Captain
A. F. Pillsbury, surveyor for the San
Francisco board of underwriters, made
an examination yesterday. He thinks the
cost of repairing the vessel will be
about $15,000. Her valuation is placed
at about $30,000. When she left Eureka
she had a cargo of about 600,000 feet of
lumber stored on her decks and in her
hold.
The first great sea that washed
over her after she bumped over the
shoals at the Eureka bar washed away
her whole deckload. When she got out
Into the open In her practically dis
mantled condition the seas thundered
away upon her decks until they dis
lodged her hatches, and the lumber and
shingles began floating out Into the sea.
Out of the original cargo of 600,000 feet
of lumber that she started with but
100,000 feet remain in her hold. Her
troubles did not end with her arrival at
the drydock. She had barely floated In
and was about settling down to the
blocks, which were being adjusted by
Diver Abrahamson, when she suddenly
toppled over to one side. The dock was
again flooded, and she was riarhted.
Catches Foot in Cartrack.
H. A. Parker was landed at the Harbor
Hospital at 3 o'clock yesterday morning with
both bones of hia right leg broken. How it
happened he was not exactly sure, but he said
he thought he caught his foot in the street ear
track, which threw him down to the pavement.
He said he was a prominent member of the
Foresters. Later, at his request, he was taken
to the City and County Hospital.

IMPROVEMENT SHOWN
BY BISHOP SPALDING
Has Regained the Use of His Left Arm
and Speaks With More
Freedom.
CINCINNATI, Jan. B.âThere was a
noticeable improvement to-night in
the condition of Bishop John L, Spald
ing, the Catholic prelate, who was
suddenly strloken with paralysis at
his residence on Friday afternoon. He
has regained somewhat the use of his
left arm and speaks with more free
dom. The remainder of the left side
of his body, however, he is unable to
use at all.
Drs. Spalding and Sla-vin to-night
spoke in a hopeful tone, but are
watching the patient closely for any
sign of a setback, which they admit
would portend the most serious re
sults.

NO SYMPATHY
FOR LAWRENCE
Los Angeles Baeegoers Are
All Sore on Jockey and
Want to See Him No More
Special Dlscatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES, Jan. B.âLast week
was a notable one in racing circles in
Los Angeles, and it is safe to say that
if there are as many developments at
Ascot this week the sports will think
that they are fast coming into their
â own in the way of getting an even
. break.
The most commendable thine: that
the judges did was the suspension of
, Jockey Lawrence, and for the eood of
âthe game it is to be hoped that he will
be ruled off. As far as any one has
been able to observe he has done the
game no good since he has been riding
here, and he has ridden any number
of races that appear to be very peculiar
ones. Just why he should be reinstated
cannot be made apparent, and he is
bound t" put the sport under suspicion
if he is put back. Lawrence is not the
only boy at Ascot that should be at
tended to, arid without doubt a num
ber of others will be reached before
many days.
During the week two trainers were
suspended, and no less than four horses
and the owner of another was fined $50
for Bending his horse into a race in an
â¢ unfit condition.
Hayes Valley Club Bouts.
Manager Morris Levy has prepared
a gre;a boxing card for next Friday
.night and expects to crowd Wooward's
Pavilion. Lew Powell, the light
weight champion, will meet Young
Choynski: ".South Side" Jack O'Brien
will meet a hard man in Abe Label
and Frank Mayfield will battle with
Joe Thomas for the welter-weight
championship of the coast. Besides
these bouts four pairs of boxers well
â¢known in local fistic circles will scrap
for trophies.
FANCY DRESS BALL CAUSES
THE SPREAD OF SMALLPOX
Theaters. Schools and Churches in
Billings, .Mont., dosed to Check
the Disease.
BILLINGS, Mont., Jan. B.âThe
ajarming spread of smallpox in this
city within the past forty-eight hours
has caused the authorities to adopt
the most stringent measures to blot
out the disease. Upon the order of
the Board of Health, ail church gath
erings have been abandoned, theatri
cal engagements canceled and the
schools closed. Lodge gatherings are
also- prohibited.
More than thirty cases of smallpox
have been reported to the officials
within the past two days, though as
yet the disease does not appear to be
of a malignant character. The pest
house is filled to overflowing and nu
merous residences are being quaran
tined to-day.
Mayor Foster, in a statement to
day, declares the prevalence of the
disease is directly due to a fancy ball
given by a secret organization in Bill
ings about two weeks ago, at which
a number of costumes imported from
an Eastern city were used. The Mayor
states that all of the afflicted ones
were present at that ball. j

to participate in the twenty-second an
nual trials of the Pacific Coast Field
Trials Club. The first brace of dogs
ill the Derby stakes will be set down
to-morrow morning upon the Gosford
ranch, near this city.
Secretary Albert Betz went over the
preserved ground of the club to-day
and found the quail plentiful and ail
other conditions favorable. There has
been a slight rainfall this evening, but
the handlers of the dogs do not expect
this to interfere with the trials. It
will improve conditions if the rain
does not continue throughout the
night. It will take two days to run
the Derby, after which the All-age
stake will be taken up. The purse in
the Derby will be $510 and a trophy
for the dogs finishing first, second and
third.
Out of the original thirty-nine
nominations for the Derby twenty
nine paid second forfeit and seventeen
will start, as against twenty last year.
The draw to-night resulted as follows:

NEW ORDERS FAIL TO GIVE
NEW YORK A DRY SUNDAY
Despite Jerome's Crusade the Situa

day. District Attorney Jerome's cru
sade for the strict enforcement of the
excise law and Magistrate Onmen's
order that the side doors of all saloons
must be kept closed and all inside par
titions tending to obstruct the view reÂ«
moved had the effect of stirring the
police to unusual activity, and many
arrests were made, but on the whole
the situation was much the same as
it had teen on preceding Sundays.

HERFORD SEEKS
A GO FOR GANS
Baltimore Manager and His
Charge Arrive to Engage
Britt or Some Other Lad
â¢
Al Herford and his fighting machine,
Joe Gans. quietly slipped up Market
street last night, and in a short time
the entire sporting fraternity was
aware that the pair' had arrived safely.
Herford says they came to meet Jimmy
Gardner, but those who know are sure
that the wise man from Baltimore town
yearns to sign his black wonder against
Jimmy Britt for a return match.
Herford has much to say about Gans*
Inability to make 133 pounds at ring
side when he faced the Californian
here last October. He feels confident,
however, that 133 pounds at 6 o'clock
will be like a cake-eating contest for
his boy, and he 'boldly announces his
willingness to pit him against any like
ly fighter here at this mark.
If no match can be arranged in this
city Herford says he is willing that the
pair meet in Baltimore for a $20,000
purse. Herford announces his willing
ness to guarantee this amount, and
adds he will be. satisfied with any good
referee, no matter whether he is a San
Francisco man br fresh from the corn
fields of the Missouri Valley.
It looks as if the Baltimore boxer is
destined to meet Mr. Britt again next
month. Herford surely has something
up his sleeve, for he is going to anchor
here tor two weqjks, and a wise man
can do a deal of business In that time.
Herford does not say outright that he
is hot after Britt, but he undoubted
ly is.
More than likely Britt and Herford
will hold a quiet little "confab" within
the next few days and then the matter
will be thoroughly threshed out and
plans outlined for the match, which the
man from Baltimore has been thinking
about for many moons. Just what
stand Britt will take remains to be
seen, but if things look right James
cannot afford to keep idle.
Herford boldly says he will not let
Britt off with such generous terms as
he had when the articles were signed
for the last go. If Nelson or Corbett
wants to take a chance against the
dusky man Herford expresses his will
ingness to talk business with them.
At all events, indications point to a
mill in this city soon in which the
lightweight champion will play a prom
inent part.

Vampires scored 2 goals to their oppo
nent's 1 and in the second period they
added 2 more, while the Occidentals

GOVERNOR DAVIS TAKES
UP BOB RICE'S FIGHT
Will Appeal to Legislature If Hot
Springs Club Refuses Horse
man a License.
LITTLE ROCK. Jan. B.âGovernor
Jefferson Davis has served notice on
the Hot Springs Jockey Club to the
effect that if Captain Bob Rice, out
lawed by the Western Jockey Club for
racing at St. Louis Union track last
year, is not permitted to race his
horses under the auspices of the Hot
Springs Club the matter will be taken
up with the Legislature. Davis wants
to see if something cannot be done to
rid the sport of horse racing in
sas from the influence and dictation of
the monopoly which arrogates to itself
the right to say when and where a
gentleman must race his own horse.
Governor Davis says he is determined
to see that Rice is honorably dealt
with in so far as the rules of the
Western Jockey Club operate in Ar
kansas.
ADAM ANDREW SELLING
STAKE NEXT IN LINE.
Rifling of Travers Calls for
General Adverse Criticism
â¦
JOCKEY BEATEN ON MANY FAVORITES
Good sport Is assured at Oakland this'
week, as an attractive programme is
offered. Wednesday there will be a
$1000 handicap for 3-year-olds and up
ward, at a mile and a sixteenth. The
same day the 2-year-olds will meet at
three and a half furlongs.
The Adam Andrew Selling stakes,
the feature of the week, has 116 eligi
bles. It will be run next Saturday-
The event will be worth more than
$3000, and is for 3-year-olds and over
at six and one-half furlongs. Among
the principal entries are Gold Money,
Military Man, Elliott, The Mighty,
Letola, Nigrette, Prince Brutus, Mar
tinmas, Sir Brillar, Pelham, Double
Six, Ishtar, Padua, Magrane, Hanault,
San Nicholas, Venator and Ananias.
There is also a mile handicap on
the programme for Saturday.
The criminally bad ride of Travers on '
Nigrette last Saturday was the general
theme of conversation among turfgoers |
yesterday, and the opinion was ex- j
pressed that the judges treated the
jockey very leniently. Eastern turfites i
say that the work of Travers in the
saddle at the Bennings meeting was I
extremely ragged and not above suspi- I
cion. Since December 9 Travers has I
met with defeat on the following pro
bounced favorites at Oakland: The j
Lieutenant, San Nicholas, Albemarle,
Venator, Handy Bill, Dr. Sherman,
Stillcho, Golden Buck, Briers on two
occasions, Sir Preston, Isabellita, Troy
twice, G. W. Trahern. Emma Reubold,
Red Cross Nurse, Honiton, Rector,
Mimo, Glendennlng, Best Man, Silver
skin and Nigrette. He also rode some
queer-looking races on second and
third choices, one especially on Aunt
Polly, when that mare was beaten out
of the show by Batidor. Forgetting the
day that Flying Torpedo downed G. W.
Trahern, the effort, if such it may be
termed, of Travers astride Nigrette on
Saturday was the limit. The idea of a
boy sitting still on a mare full of run 1
and only nodding, and a 100 to 1 Bhot ,
cutting out the pace. It all reads like .
a summer idyl of the bushes.
Aleck Ullman, a member of the
Metropolitan Turf Association, has ar

TENNIS CRACKS
DODGE SHOWERS
Several Stars Hook Up in
Exciting Games of the
(ontinuous Tournament
The rain held off long enough yes
terday to allow most of the players to
complete their matches. A few of the
tardy ones were disappointed. In the
continuous tournament, three matches
were played. Carl Gardner, No. 9 in
the first class, beat George Busch, No.
8. and Melville Long, No. 12, beat
Chester Smith, No. 11. Moulten War
ner. No. 2 in the third class, beat Dr.
Lovegrove, No. 3.
Both of the first class matches were
v. on in straight sets. Gardner beat
Busch 6-4, 6-3 and Long beat Smith
6-1, 6-3. Busch was not in good condi
tion and his cleverer opponent was
never in danger of losing. Busch has
some good strokes but Is shy on en
durance. The Smith-Long match was
a walkover for the latter. Smith has
had no practice of late, while the fast
improving Long was at his best- Of
the three tournament maunes, the one
between the third class players, War
ner and Dr. Lovegrove, was by far the
closest. The doctor played his best
game and his younger opponent had to
extend himself to win. Some clever
practice games were piayed In doubles.
The best match was that in which
Albert Kenyon and Grant Smith beat
Harry Rolfe and Sidney Salisbury.
The later led in the early stages of
both sets but Kenyon and Smith fin
ished strongly and won out. The third
set stood 3-3 and deuce when the rain
put a stop to play. Following are the
results:
' Continuous tournament: First classâCarl
Gar.lner (!)) beat George Bunch (8). 6-4, 8-8;

Fierce and Fatal Fighting in Connec
tion With Strike at Baku
Oil Fields.
BAKU, Jan. BâA big Are, presum
ably of incendiary origin, to-day de
stroyed sixteen tanks on the Nobels
camps and several adjoining prop
erties.
There has been no actual fighting
since January 5, when a collision oc
curred between strikers and Cossacks,
i and six workmen were killed and two
i Cossacks and thirty workmen injured.
! The strike has been in progress since
j December 26. The original dispute was
' over hours and wages. The first few
J days of the strike there was no
j trouble, but on December 29 crowds
threatened the guards stationed about
the refining works and Cossacks were
called out. Many men were injured in
desultory fighting between strikers and
soldiers at various points.
The wage question stih remains un
settled, the men demanding $10 to
$11.50 a month. A big meeting at which
jit was decided to continue the strike
j led up to the fighting on January 5.

HUMBOLDT HAS NO CHANCE
AGAINST CARLOW BOY.
Match Race Is DisappointingâRichard
Anton Regains His Old Form.
Carlow Boy defeated Humboldt In
hollow fashion in the match race yes
terday at Union Coursing Park. The
Boy succeeded in winning the neces
sary three courses. Humboldt raised
the flag in the second trial, which was
the only course he scored. Corder's
dog showed the speed. In the first
three trials he led Humboldt from one
to three lengths, and in the last run I
he was five lengths in front of the son I
of Hot Stuff when the hare was forced
to. turn. Humboldt failed to score in
this course. Humboldt won his only
course by a point, He slightly out
worked the favorite in the second trial.
The talent laid against Humboldt in
the four races.
J. Sweeney's Richard Anton ran up
to his best form and captured the open
etake in championship style. He was
made one of the stake favorites in the
long-odds book. He showed the foot
in all his courses and worked the same
to perfection. In the final he raised
the flag over the Eastern doit. Cran
berry Sauce. The latter is now show
ing his true form, and will be a hard
one to beat from now on.
The defeat of McVey by Texas Ma
mie in the third round was a rude shock
to the wise ones. They freely laid 5 to
1 against Mamie, who won by outwork
ing the favorite in a limit course. Lost
Chord was bowled over in the first
round by The Raider, an outsider at 6
to 1. During the first twelve races
eight short ends scored at juicy odds.
The tide then turned, and from then on
but a few outsiders bothered the tal
ent. The hares were a strone lot and
provided excellent tests. Following are
the day's results, with the scores of
Judge P. J. Reilly:
Open stake: First roundâBob R beat Romp
PRICHARD HAS
HIGHEST SCORE
Shell Mound Marksmen
Toast Man Who Made the
Most Kings Last Season
A big crowd of marksmen turned out
at Shell Mound Park yesterday. The
weather was against good marksman
ship, as darkness and rain set in dur
ing the early afternoon and made it
almost impossible for the riflemen to
center their shots.
The main event of the day was the
wind-up shoot for the year of the
Golden Gate Rifle and Pistol Club.
Prizes to the successful marksmen
were distributed at the banquet given
in the large hall of the park. M. J.
White, president of the club, recounted
its successful history and introduced
W. C. Prichard, who won the honor of
king for the year 1904. Remarks were
made by many well-known marksmen.
In the re-entry match monthly con
test of the Golden Gate Club W. F.
; Blasse with 221 rings was high man.
In the pistol re-entry match M. J.
White with 89 was the leader, closely
followed by J. P. Cosgrave, with 83. 77
and 74 to his credit. The revolver con
test brought out good scores. W. C.
Prichard rolled up 95 out of a possible
100 and G. E. Frahm made 90. In the
annual contest Frank E. Mason was
the winner of the first prize, with 2290
rings, being nearly 23 rings out of a
possible 25, which is a very high score,
even among the champions. A. C.
Gehret was his nearest competitor,
with 2262 rings. The prize winners on
the pistol target were.W. F. Prichard.
945; G. E. Frahm, 944, and W. R. Proll.

BAIN HAILED
AS CHAMPION
Invincible Al Hampton Is
Outplayed in a Special
Soft Ball Match Contest
Fred Bain defeated Al Hampton in
the special match game of handball
for a silver cup at the Olympic Club
yesterday afternoon. Bain's victory
stamps him as the best soft-handball
player on the coast. Hampton's de
feat was a surprise to the wise ones,
who lost considerable in betting. Bain
outplayed Hampton and won on his
merits. Hampton is a star hard ball
player, but cannot play soft ball with
such a fast man as Bain. Scores:
21-10, 21-8. Bain won the soft ball
tournament and the special cup put
up by Louis Rosenfeld and Kenneth
Rosenfeld.
Clarence Clough beat Robert Bain
in two straight games and C. Carr
beat Guy Ransome. W. P. Humphrey
and F. C. Wegener are to play next
Wednesday evening.

letic Association closed yesterday. The

of Louis Levy, Henry Cory, George
James and George Cunningham. J. J.
Gleason, substitute. Roger Cornell
will train the Olympic club team.
Each man must play twelve games.
Great interest is being taken in the
big tournament. A silver cup and in
dividual prizes will be awarded the
victorious team.
Antioch Eleven Wins.
ANTIOCH. Jan. B.âThe Antioch

BUSY BURGLAR
VISITS STORES
Effects Entrance to Groceries
in the Western Addition
by Breaking Glass Doors
A busy burglar visited three gro
ceries in the Western Addition early
yesterday morning and was cought in
side the third. He entered in each
instance by breaking the glass door
and unlocking it by shoving his arm
through the hole-
Shortly before 2 o'clock Mrs. E.
Eaumback, 1601 Golden Gate avenue,
was awakened by the noise of breaking
â  glass. She looked out of her window
and saw a man entering the grocery
of Mrs. M. Hughes, 1534 Golden Gate
avenue. She telephoned to the O'Far
rell-street police station and Policemen
O'Brien and O'Neil were sent to the
grocery in the patrol wagon. They met
special officer Fianjjagan and took him
with them.
The front door was open and when
they entered they discovered a man
hiding behind the counter. He gave
his name as John Smith, a mill-hand,
21 years of age, and said he lived at 25
Powell street. When searched cigar
ettes, tobacco, sardines and matches
were found in his possession. He had
a loaded revolver and an opal pin.
He was arrested for burglary.
The police were later notified that
the grocery of John Rauch, 1601 Turk
street, had been entered by a burglar
by breaking the glass in the door. An
opal pin and $3.36 had been stolen from
the cash register. Conrad Rlchter,
ICO2 Turk street, identified the opal pin
found on Smith as one he had given to
Rauch for safe keeping.
About 1.15 a. m- Sergeant Boyd and
Special Policeman Doyle noticed that
the glass in the side door of the
grocery of I* M. Walter, California and
Devisadern streets, had been broken.
They notified the proprietor, who lives
opposite, but after making an exam
ination he said that nothing had been
stolen. The police are satisfied that
v Smith did this job also.

LIVES CLOSED
BY GAS FUMES
James Hickey, Old Park La
borer, Found DeadâPo
liceman Has Narrow Escape
JET PARTLY TURNED ON
Y. Asakawa, a Japanese Ser
vant, Who Went to Bed HI,
Passes Away by Monoxide
Two cases of gas asphyxiation were
reported to the Morgue yesterday,
both supposed to have been the result
of accident. The first was that of
James Hickey, 1185 Waller street. He
was 67 years of age and for the laat
twenty-seven years had been employed
as a laborer at Golden Gate Park.
Hickey went to bed about 9 o'clock
on Saturday night in excellent spirits.
Shortly after 6 o'clock yesterday
morning his daughter, Annie, detected
the odor of gas and traced it to a
room occupied by Policeman W. L.
Ceinar. The gas Jet was all right In
his room. She awakened him with
considerable difficulty and it was some
time before he was able to stagger to
his feet.
She left Ceinar and entered her
father's room. He was unconscious in
bed. Ceinar notified the Park police
station and Hickey was taken to the
Park Emergency Hospital, where life
was pronounced extinct. The body
was not taken to the Morgue.
The door of Hickey's room was
open a few inches and the window was
also slightly open. He was in the
habit of leaving a glass of wine at his
bedside to take during the night and
it is supposed he turned on the gas
to drink the wine, as the glass was
empty. The jet was partly open.
The other case was that of Y. Asa
kawa, a Japanese servant in the
employ of Mrs. Andrew J. Moul
der, 1941 Clay street. When he re
tired on Saturday night he' com
plained of being sick. As he did
not appear at his usual hour yesterday
morning Mrs. Moulder thought she
would allow him to sleep till she re
turned at noon from church. When
she returned from church she went to
his room* and.found him dead in bed.
Gas was flowing from an open Jet.

FINDS POISON
IN HER COFFEE
Gustay Ahlstedt Accused
by Wife of Having Had
Desire to Take Her Life
HE ONCE SHOT A MAN
Police Think They Have a
Good Case Against Pris
oner in Their Custody
For the second time in three years
Gusto v Ahlstedt, twice married, is In
custody of the police charged with a
serious crime. He is accused by his
wife, Margaret, with having attempted
to poison her with strychnine. The
woman says that last Thursday her
husband, from whom she Is expecting
to get a divorce, entered her rooms at
331 Jessie street and placed poison in
some Jellies and also in a coffee pot
that was on the stove.
Mr*. Ahlstedt, on entering the prem
ises, discovered an empty bottle in
which had been the poison. Remem
bering that on January 29, 190?, Ahl
stedt had killed a man whom he ac
cused of winning the affections of his
first wife, the second Mrs. Ahlstedt
took time and her designing spouse by
the forelock. Soon thereafter Police
man Thomas Finley landed hubby in
Jail.
The. charge'against Ahlstedt is vio
lating section 347 of the Penal Code,
which provides punishment for poison
ers. Ahlstedt denies that he attempted
to commit a crime and declares that
he knows nothing about the poison
that is said to have been injected into
his wife's eatables.
Ahlstedfs first wife died about two
years ago and soon afterward he mar
ried the woman who now wants him
sent to San Quentin for conspiracy.
Divorce proceedings have been pend
ing, but, according to Mrs. Ahlstedfs
story, the man has been attempting
to effect a reconciliation. She says
that on last Thursday, during her ab
sence from home, Ahlstedt left his
rooming place at 55 East Park street
and at the Jessie street house gained
an entrance through a back window,
that he dosed the jellies and the cof
fee and then dropped the bottle that
had contained the poison. It was
found on the floor. Mrs. Ahlstedt re
ported the matter to the police and
Detective Gibson was detailed to make
an investigation. Gibson thinks he can
prove that Al&stedt bought the poison
and that he afterward transferred it to
a bottle of a particular make that was
known to have been some time in his
possession.
On January 29, 1902, Ahlstedt shot
and killed Thomas Normile a laborer.
Normile and Mrs. Ahlstedt had been
visiting friends near the Ahlstedt home
on Bernai Heights and both returned
at a late hour intoxicated. Ahlstedt
found his wife and Normile sitting to
gether in the backyard of his home and
he shot and instantly killed the man.
He was acquitted of the charge of
murder.
Ahlstedt has been addicted to the
use of liquor for years. He is a labor
er, employed occasionally in the street
department.
An Atchison man is so busy that he
could hardly find time to attend hiy
own funeral, to say nothing of attend
ing the funerals of friends. 3

SALOON VISITED
BY MASKED MEN
John Bielenberg, Proprietor,
and George Goodwin Look
Into Muzzle of Revolvers
John Bielenberg, saloon-keeper, 398
Ninth street, was chatting- with George
Goodwin of 1492 Folsom street about
1:30 o'clock yesterday morning when
two men wearing red colored handker
chiefs over their faces entered. Each
had a revolver in his right hand and
{he taller of the two ordered Bielenberg
and Goodwin to throw up their hands.
The order was quickly obeyed. One
kept the muzzle of a revolver pointed
toward the victims, while the other
deftly went through their pockets. A
silver watch valued at $30, a gold link
chain valued at $40 and $3 were taken
from Blelenberg's pockets. Goodwin
lost a gold watch valued at $25, a gold
plated chain with gold padlock and $2.
The cash register was then opened and
$10 taken from it
"If you make a noise after we leave,"
said the taller of the two robbers, "we
will come back and kill you." They
hurried from the place and no sooner
had they disappeared than Bielenberg
blew his police whistle long and loudly.
Policemen Hammond and Madden
heard the whistle and ran toward the
saloon. They were told of the hold-up
and made a search of the neighborhood,
but could find no trace of the men. De
tective Mulcahy had occasion to visit
the saloon about five minutes after the
hold-up.
From the coolness displayed by the
robbers it is thought they are old hands
at the business. One is described as
about 30 years of age. 5 feet 10 inches
tall, and the other about 5 feet 8 inches
tall. His handkerchief dropped from
his face for a moment while he was
going through Blelenberg's pockets and
he had a smooth, red face. Bielenberg
thinks he would know the man.

THEATER-GOERS'
OLD FAVORITE
DIES DESTITUTE
From the glare of the footlights, the
applause of thousands of old San Fran
ciscans, and the portrayal of leading
roles with great actors of by-gone
years, to a slab at the Morgue is the
sad life's end of the brilliant and tal
ented Nellie Cummings.
For many years Nellie Cummings.
as leading woman for John McCullough
and Lawrence Barrett at the old Cali
fornia Theater, in the truly palmy days
of the drama, will be remembered by
old-time playgoers. After that time
she drifted East, playing with many
first-class companies, notably those of
Richard Mansfield. Frederick Warde
and Edna Wallace Hopper.
With the approach of age. engage
ments came less frequently and she
contracted asthma, which finally
caused her death yesterday among
sympathetic strangers at 418 Kearny
street. She had been playing a brief
engagement with a small stock com
pany In San Jose, but returned two
days ago, worn and weak, seeking a
place to die. She had many friends
here, from whom she withheld the
knowledge of her reduced finances and
misery.
Miss Cummings came from Boston.
Mass., of a fine "Backbay" family, and
married a man in private life. At one
time she owned valuable real estate on
