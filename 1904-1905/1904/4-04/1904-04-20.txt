By a vote of 151' to 115 the Hearst
resolution of indorsement was turned
down in the convention this afternoon.
After the report of the committee on
platform and resolutions had been read.
R. G. Smith of Josephine stepped
to the platform and asked the chair
man for permission to speak.
"I offer this as a resolution," said
Smith- "I will let the clerk read it."
The little piece of paper was a resolu
tion to the effect that the Oregon dele
gates to the national convention should
be. instructed for Hearst and thus the
long expected dynamite bomb was
flung 1 Into the expectant convention.
â¢*Be It resolved," read the clerk, "that
our delegates to the Democratic na
tional convention, to be held at St.
Louis on July 4, 1904, be and they are
hereby instructed to vote tor the Hon.
William Randolph Hearst, and that
they take all honorable means to se
cure his nomination.*' '
The moment that the clerk finished
a score of the boomers were on their
feet in all parts of the hall, shouting
6econds to the motion. Jeffrey of Mar

The Hearst slate was smashed and
only a piece or two was saved in the
election of delegates to the national
convention this evening. The delegates
are as follows: Governor George E.
Chamberlain, Portland; W. F. Butch
er. Baker City; J. B. Matlock, Hepp
ner; C. E. Redfleld, Eugene; F. V. Hol
man, Portland; James Gleason, Port
land; T. R. Sheridan, Roseburg; Sam
M. Garland. Linn.
They are uninstructed. None of these
men are for Hearst, except, perhaps, in
a case of a scramble for the band
wagon. Six of the eight have expressed
etrong anti-Hearst views, and only one
has shown anything like a preference
for the representative in Congress from
New York.
"Governor Chamberlain," said Ga
tens. "told me yesterday afternoon not
to allow his name to be mentioned, and
if it should be presented to withdraw
it, as it was against his wishes."

lor the Presidential office. Last night
the Hearst managers declared war on
the Democratic State Central Commit
tee and resolved on an attempt to
sc:ze the organization of the State con
vention this morning. Better counsel
prevailed before the delegates were
called to order by Chairman Sam White
of Baker City. The temporary offi
cers named by him went through with
out a dissenting voice.
Between the motion for the ap
pointment of the committees and their
selection the time was occupied by the
delegates from each judicial district
more for the discussion of Hearst's
candidacy and prospects of election
than in the selection of committee
men. Hearst men from the country
precincts were rampant, but the con
servative element from the cities
seemed to serve as a check on them.
The final real damper on the Hearst
people came when \V. X. Gatens, sec
retary to Governor Chamberlain, read
a letter from his chief. Chamberlain's
r.ame had been used both to promote
#nd to injure Hearst's candidacy and,
refusing to be used as a tool by either
Bide, the Governor authorized his sec
retary to withdraw his name if it w^ere
mentioned for the office of Vice Pres

officers of the Mormon church who are
expected to give important evidence on
the question of the continued practice
of polygamy are in hiding.
This, new series of hearings will
therefore occupy only two or three
days when the committee will arrange
for sending a sub-committee to Utah

Warning to Merchant Ships.
The' commercial depression in the
United Kingdom Was aggravated by
the conditions in South Africa. The
revenue for 1903-04 was $13,620,000
below the estimate, while the expendi-i
tures exceeded the estimate by 515,
035,000. The repeal of the duty on
wheat had been more costly than an
ticipated, without affording the con
sumer the relief expected. The net
total deficit for the fiscal year was
$27,075,000.
Chamberlain estimated the expendi
ture of 1904-5 at $714,400,000, and the
revenue on the basis of E the existing
taxation at $695,300,000, leaving- a defi
cit of $19,100,000 to be made up. He
proposed, therefore, to increase the in
come tax by. two cents. ' He also pro
posed an additional tax of four cents
per pound on tea. The Chancellor fur
ther proposed a readjustment of the to
bacco tax, imposing a duty of 81' cents
on tobacco ' stripped; before ~ imported,
also an additional duty of 12 cents on
cigars" and "an additional 75 cents on
foreign cigarettes. ' -
Chamberlain proposed also to raise
the moisture limit to 32 per cent and
introduce three or four different rates
in the drawbacks, which . he hoped
would increase Great Britain's tobacco
export trade, especially. to the colonies.
The net gain by these tobacco changes
was estimated at. $2,750,000. â¢

Admiral Skrydloff arrived here to-day
on his way .to the. Far "East, where he
will take command of the Russian fleet
at s Port Arthur. He was accorded an
enthusiastic reception by the people
who thronged the. streets. \

was black .with people,- and the police
guarding the platform Vere quite un
able-to cope with the .'crowds which
brpice through the cordon and rushed
toward the train! ."â¢' â¢Â¦':" . â¢
J; There were repeated outbreaks of
enthusiastic cheers as the admiral left
the _car_and jj from the v bareheaded
throng a peasant stepped out and pre
sented Admiral Skrydloff with a copy
of :a. picture entitled "The Holy Virgin
of Joy toV the Afflicted," which is re
puted . to .have miraculous Dower.
The peasant also presented the ad
miral â¢ with 1 ; consecrated bread, telling
Skrydloff that â¢ he saluted him In the
name of ( the masses of the Russian
peopled all \ of â¢ whose â¢ hopes depended
on him as the hero of , the Russo-
TurKish/waV.; :
.5' â¢â¢The people are : convinced," added
'the spokesman, V ','that Admiral Skryd
loff "will Justify the hopes, of the Em
peror and the fatherland and, like the
Virgin whose picture has Just been
given .him, will', bring Joy, and that
soon, to a people now afflicted."
The Admiral, who was visibly affect
ed, took the picture, declaring that he
accepted It as \ a happy presage, and
adding that he'w~ould not part with the
picture throughout. the campaign and
that he would put all his faith In God.
A representative of the middle classes
presented the admiral with a picture
of St. Theodosius, the miracle worker
bf'Czerniakqff. The admiral then en
tered a carriage and drove off, followed
by deafening . shouts of ' "Long live
Skrydloff!"
Addressing the newspaper men, the
admiral declared he was deeply sensi
ble'of the kindness shown him. Subse
quently. Skrydloff called on the Grand
Duke Alexis, high admiral, and Vice
Admiral Avellan, chief of the Ad
miralty.
To-morrow he will be received in
audience by the Emperor and Em

Sebastopol on Saturday to formally

ST. PETERSBURG, April 19.â The
immediate cause for the Viceroy's ap
plication for retirement is reported to
foe the appointment of Vice Admiral
Skrydloff, one of Admiral Alexieff 's
strongest enemies and sharpest critics,
as successor to the late Vice Admiral
Makaroff in command of the Russian
navy in the Far East.
Vice AdmirarSkrydloff had an In
terview with the Emperor to-day and
discussed with his. Majesty the ques
tion of his (Skrydloff's) relations with
Alexieff. The relieving from command
of Viceroy Alexieff would not surprise
intelligent observers of the Far East
ern situation who are familiar with
the gradual change In the Emperor's
attitude toward the Viceroy and M.
Bezebrazoff, who represented the mili
tant or advanced element, which was
anxious that Russia should remain in
Manchuria. ; -^
It was to these two men that the
Anglo-Japanese entente first lost its
friends. They believed that Great
Britain would not goto war and that
Japan could not do so. To the Indig
nation of Japan they succeeded in
turning the policy of the empire from
carrying out the treaty for the entire
evacuation of Manchuria, pending fur
ther demands on China.
On August 12 last, after Japan had
submitted an inquiry as to whether or
not Russia was disposed to reopen the
negotiations respecting Manchuria and
Korea, a Viceroyalty in the Far East,
a special Secretary of State and an ad
visory committee were created, Alexieff
being appointed Viceroy and Bezebra
zoff Secretary of Sfate.
Seventeen days after the appoint
ments were made M. Witte, who had
been opposed to the policy of Alexieff
and Bezebrazoff, was relieved of his
portfolio as Minister of Finance.
It was through his new official ad
visers that the Emperor conducted ne
gotiations with Japan, and It is
claimed that they misjudged the' tem
per and purpose of the Japanese and
left the Emperor in ignorance of the
preparations for war which Japan was
making and the rising spirit of that
empire.
The enemies of Alexieff have persist
ently asserted that as the man on the
spot he should have kept the Emperor
informed. concerning these vital points.
.On [the; eve of the war Alexieff ap
pareritlyiBtUT had the confidence of the
Czar, but'ithe lack of preparedness of
the Port!' Arthur fleet, as shown in the
pases of : the battleships Retvizan and
Cesarevitch, called the attention of the
Emperor to the slackness of the naval
administration in the Far East,

WHAT TEA DOES TO
RHEUMATICS.
WbÂ«n yon next take tea, think of this.
Tea contains 115 jprain* of Uric
in every pound.
Meat contain* only ftva to seven
Rheuraatlism la Uric Add In the blood.
Uric AdA accumulates from food when
the diÂ«e*tlve apparatus cannot create
enough Alkaline elements (like ***!&) to
neutralize it
ThiÂ» 'Add collects urea, or worn-oat
waste matter, from the system.
That Urea enters the blood when Alka-
line action has not previously <Us-
eolved it.
By and by the waste matter reaches
thÂ« Joints and muscle*, through circula-
tion of the blood.
There It - gradually deposits In solid
particles, like srannlated sugar.
These solid particles grind between
the Joints and muscles at every move-
ment.
This crtnding causes Irritation ani
pain. . .Â¦,.'*
These In turn may de-velop ixLflamm*/-
tion and swellins;. That inflammation
bestirs Nature to help herself.
8 he proceeds to coat the hard Uric par-
ticles over with cushions of palpy mo-
oous. like the first healing- strata of aa
outer sore. . *
This pulpy corertng grows to thÂ«
bones, as well as to the particles deposit-
ed. There It hardens like plaster ,or
sealing wax. -Thsn wÂ« bars "tony
Joints, 7 ' almost Inflexible, and usually
ixed in a bended position, from the pain
and Inflammation.
That is Rheumatism at tta worst.
It is bad enough before it gets tfca*
far. . Â¦Â¦ . 1
There is but one sure way of ecrlsf-
Rheumatlsm. The first step is to neutral-
ize ths Uric Add already In the system.
Next, to dissolve, and carry away, ths
hard deposits that grind " between the
Joints. Then get the digestive apparatus
Into such healthy condition thai It will,
unaided, produce less Uric Add, ana
more Alkaline*.
This is what Doctors generally hart
failed to do.
It Is what I studied a lifetime to ac-
complish, aod achieved only after many
failures and thousands of experiments.
At last I found, in Germany, a Solvent
which was not only effective, but abso-
lutely safe to usa
Few agents powerful enough to be ef-
fective in Rheumatism ore safe. Â¦
My discovery, now called "Dr. Shoop â¢
Rheumatic Cure." acts directly, but in-
ternally, upon Uric Add In the Joints
and muscles.
It dissolves, and carries off, the pain-
ful deposits, producing an Immediate Al-
kaline condition of the blood, and neu-
tralizing the Acid in it which would
have fed the Rheumatism and extended
the disease. _, .
It won't restore bony Joints to flexibil-
ity, and it can't undo, in a week, tbÂ«
damage caused by years of rheumatlo
condition.
But it will benefit every ease, and it
will entirely cure most cases of Rheuma-
tism.
So sure am I of this, that I will supply
Dr. Shoop's Rheumatic Cure, to any sick
one who writes me for it. on a month's
trial, at my risk. . / â¢
If it succeeds, the cost to him Is only
$5.50 for the six bottle treatment.
If it fails. I bear the whole cost my-
self.
And â he alone shall be the Judge-
shall decide who shall pay.
Surely you will' not continue to suffer
when you can thus get well, at my risk.
I have written an important Treatise
on Rheumatism, telling of its relief and
cure.
It is free to Rheumatic people.
Write me a post card for it to-day.

Four, essential advantages enable us to make suits to order for less money
than is asked by any other tailor in the West. .
We buy the cloth;direct from the mills-â buy largely for our wholesale New
York establishment, at good discounts. In ordering for wholesale we purchase
enough additional cloth to supply our two retail, stores here in San Francisco. 'All
other tailors must buy from jobbers. Just investigate this fact. .
Our profit on each individual suit is small. But making a great many suits
each month our business is necessarily large. .'" i
I Â¦ v .We arenot compelled to allo^w^for suits left on our hands as other tailors do.
Should a suit be returhed or uncailed for we place it in our resdyrmade stock at a
reduced-price merely^to coyer the cost .--of making. Therefore we- lose no money
in miking you another suit, if the first does not please : irV every way.\

Cash Drawer Is -Rifled.
Richard Kummerlander. saloon-keep
er fn the basement ojf 544 California
street, reported to the police yester
day that between midnight "and S
o'clock yesterday morning his cash
drawer had been forced open and $20
in silver stolen. It is supposed that
the thief was locked in the saloon "when
it was closed at midnight, as the pad
lock on the outside front door was all
right, but the inside lock had been
broken off. "When the thief found that
he could. not get out by the front door
he made his escape through the ele
vator leading to B. F. Jellison's sa
loon above.
and why should be steal a bit of Jew
elry that is not worth more than $10?"
There was' no .'answering- such logic
as. that, and the prosecuting attorney
did not attempt the task. â¢ . -
The girl stated that she' had been
jsngaged to Pacheco about five months,
knd that the wedding Is to take place
June 1â provided the- groom-elect Is not
in prison on that date. Reputable wit
nesses testified Â¦' to ; the previous good
character of the accused, and the Judge
took the case under advisement.
They claim the assessment is illegal
because it is a violation- of a by-law of
the corporation which .provides that
no assessment shall be levied until all
the original capital stock of the corpo
ration has been issued. The plain
tiffs claim that there are still unsold
250 shares of the original stock.

The Police Commission haa neither the pow
er*, functions nor the prerogatives of a court
of law. While it may be termed a disciplinary
tribunal and its power* are subordinate to the
latter, yet In this Instance the Board of Police
Commissioners has exercised a power which no
court of jaw possesses. It has overridden the
provisions of an act of Congress and dlsre
carded the bankruptcy proceedings in a Fed
eral court. Such a proceeding cannot be sus
tained nor can the board be made a collection
bureau . ? -. *
The decision will be appealed from by
the City Attorney.
According to Superior Judge John
Hunt the Board of Police Commission
ers has no right to constitute itself .a
collection agency for the benefit of
firms or individuals that are : creditors
xif members of the force. He so decided
yesterday in the case of former Police
Officer Paul Cleu, who applied, to rjlm
for an annulment of the proceedings
hi the Commissioners . wliich resulted
ill his dismissal from the force for fail
ing to pay J.oseph Ferria $24 80 and a
laundry company $S 60. The applica
tion was granted. In the opinion handed
down by Judge Hunt he says:
' Under the rule of the Police Commission
any debt owing by a police officer may be
made & ernund for his removal, even If such
<>bt Â«"â¢* contracted before his appointment or
even'ir it Â«u barred by th* statute of lim
itations, or he might be removed for his omis
sion to pay a debt although he has not the
ability to do ao. . It > the officer disputed the
indebtedness or denied its legality or contested
the amount thereof the board, if it acted at
all, must act as a court of law and determine
Â¦wrhether any liability In fact existed.
- Furthermore, the rule might serve.-- if en

In the manner described the dredger
has cut a channel through " the outer
bar 297 feet wide at a uniform depth
of 30 feet at low tide. The depth be
fore the dredging was from 21% feet
at low tide on the apex of the bar
to 30 feet at the outer ends of the
cut. This work has been accomplished
since last July, and now the dredger
is cutting through the middle ground,
which is just inside the harbor entrance
and compels vessels to make a turn
and get into the western channel in
stead of keeping straight on in, what
should be and will be known as the
main channel. Here the cut is ' not
near so long, and is to be made wider.
A channel 500 feet is to be cut through
the middle ground to a depth of 28
feet at low water, which is practically
the same as the depth, outside, where
allowance has to be made for a ground
swell of two feet on the ocean. About
one-third of the work on the " middle
ground has been completed.
SAX DIEGO, April- 19.â Captain A.
A. Polhmus, with, his big centrifugal

ing and has done a great work in mak
ing perfect. the entrance to San Diego
Bay. The Salt Lake City. is a power
ful suction pump on a barge, . which
also has room for the boilers which
supply steam for the powerful, pump,
engine, workshop and even kitchen and
sleeping rooms for the men who work
on board. Through an immense , suc
tion pipe, which drops into the water
to a depth of thirty feet and more if
desired, the pump draws up water and
sand cf. the consistency oP mud and
drops 4t into a barge alongside., ,- The
sand remains in., the barge, while, the
water flows over the side. Each barge
holds- about? S00 cubic' yards of.fsand.
When .a fllled-Jiarge .is ..tqwed^ away

Therefdre Director': Goodwin estimates
ihat the Korean trade with this coun
try would show a much larger bulk if
it could all be carefully traced.
The imoorts are chiefly cotton' and
v oolen goods.% metals, kerosene, 3ilk
and the machinery for the use of, the

in their construction. The chief ex- i
ports are rice, beans, hides, 'girisang j
and copper. ' Director Goodwin" shows ;
the extent to which Japan is now, in
terested in the commerce of Korea.
"The/trade of Korea with Japan," j
says Mr. Goodwin, "is growing more j
rapidly, than, with any other country,.',
the importations of cotton goods from
Japan amounting to from two to trir-?e
million yen annually. Cotton goods are
the largest single commodity in the
value of. importations into Korea.i
amounting from six to seven million yen j
annually. Silk goods imported amount j
to about 1,500,000 yen per annum." j
These and other facts have been am- J
bodied in .a circular to the members j
of the Pacific Commercial Museum.!

Deputy Superintendent of Schools W.
B. Howard will, at the request of his
superior. Superintendent Langdon, re
tire from his position on May 1, to
make room for Henry Suzzalo, who
formerly held one of the deputyshipa.
In asking for Howard's resignation
Langdon by no means casts any re
flections on his ability and efficiency
in the place, but it is simply a case of
Howard succumbing to the political ex
igencies.
Howard was the fourth deputy ap
pointed .by former Superintendent , of
Schools Webster, and has held the placÂ»
ever since Langdon assumed office In
January of last year, although Lang
don asked for the resignations of the
other three of Webster's deputies al
most immediately after taking office.
It was supposed that the deputies were
appointed for a term of four years, but
the Superior Court decided that they
held office at the pleasure of the Su
perintendent of Schools. Howard's
four-year term will expire In May. and
thus he has reaped the benefit at a
full term. Howard will retire with
the good wishes of all those with whom
he has come in contact, Including the
School Directors, principals, teachers
and his coworkers.
Suzzalo, who is about to- return from
Columbia University, where he held an
important post in the educational de
partment, will be appointed to the va
cancy created by Howard's retirement.
Suzzalo is on a year's leave of absence
and was succeeded last May by Arthur
A. McCurda. but at the time It wa3
understood that McCurda's appoint
ment was merely temporary.
McCurda has been doing good work
in his position and Superintendent
Langdon is desirous of retaining him.
That Langdon will do so seems to be
assured, and Suzzalo will take How
ard's place in order to leave McCurda
undisturbed. . ; v "'Â¦-/Â¦

Without the aid of an interpreter, S.

of France who are amusing themselves
4n this country by serving at table in

' Louis Pacheco's fiancee, a very pretty
girl, sat. beside him in Judge Fritz's
court while witnesses told of how he
had stolen a pair of diamond earrings
from a Jewelry stt'e. "When she was
called to the witness stand, the young
woman glanced encouragingly at her

declared she believed in his innocence.

the prosecuting attorney. "When he

Seventeen-year-old Gustav Benar
was such an Idle fellow that his wid
owed mother had him consigned to the
naval training station on Goat Island,
but he had not been there long when
the routine became irksome and be es
caped and returned to the maternal
roof tree. That was early in January
last, and Gustar never contributed one
cent for bed, board or clothing, until
his mother, through sheer necessity,
was obliged to have him arrested for
vagrancy. Judge Mogan sent the hulk
ing youth back. to Goat Island, where
he has three more* years to serve be
fore Uncle Sam will release him.
Down from Mare Island came Wil
liam Mowlder. a navy yard machinist,
to spend Sunday In the household of
one of his oldest and most highly es
teemed friends. He, co,uld not explain
to Judge Cabaniss how it came to pass
that his visit resulted in his arrest, for
he had no recollection of throwing. his
friend's family out of their dwelling
arid hurling sundry articles of furni
ture after them, in which labor he was
strenuously occupied when the ejected
ones rallied and had him arrested. Ten
dollars or ten days, and the fine was
paid.
Thomas and fteorge confessed' that
they were fond of displaying their ap
parel where its radiance would be en
hanced by ; sunbeams, but they failed
to prove visible means of support.
Then they were remanded for a week.
"These chaps are afflicted with the
sun-bath habit," said Patrolman T. J.
Cavanaugh as . he accused Thomas
Bunch and George Stewart, flashily
attired young colored men, of^vagrancy.
"They do nothing except ehafee the sun
all day and loaf around saloons all
right," continued the officer, "and I
can't find any honest channel through
which their glad rags are obtained."
Albert Mulberry and John Johnson,
had been \ making a night of. it and
were "awaiting the arrival of an ow!
car at Halght and Stanyan streets
when three waiters, who had also been
sipping nocturnal pleasures, joined
them in waiting. The quintet began
discussing the irregularity of the t cara
that fly by night and the argument
soon became so earnest that a battle
royal resulted. Mulberry and Johnson
being pitted against the trio of nap
kin flourishers. They were all mixed
up when' a brace of patroTmen arrived
and arrested Mulberry -and Johnson,
it being shown that they had been the

After quarreling at 4 o'clock yester
day morning, in their common apart

decided that. they would\part to meet

of that resolve the man â as men some
times, doâ went forth to seek forget
fulness in strong drink, while the
woman â as women frequently do- â de
termined to find oblivion in the grave.
So she swallowed a large dose of po
tassium of something and lay down
to die, in. which condition she was
found by the man, who had returned
to ask her for. more money with Which
to precipitate his flight to sodden ine
briety. He was sUH sufficiently sober
to realize that delay in summoning aid
for the woman might prove fatal to
her and inconvenient to himself, so
hÂ«; lost no time, in getting her removed
to the Receiving Hospital. There she
responded to restoratives and was soon
pronounced but . 6t danger, and then
both she ana the 'man were arrested

seen her before.
"Yes," she murmured, "you saw me

again."

"Yep," replied Mrs. Anderson, "and

SANTA BARBARA, April 19. â
Santa Barbara in In the hands of the
Camino Real delegates, such of them
as are not held up on th^ way by a
washout between Ventura arid Â» Car
pinteria. The delegates arrived at a
wretchedly early morning hour in a
downpour of rain and were met by a
smiling delegation from the local
Board of Trade. News of the washout
caused a delay in the calling to order
of the convention, which was sched
uled for 2 o'clock,- but the intervening
hours -were gaily spent in caucusing
and canvassing and extending the
hand of brotherly lo^ve to the fellow
delegates from down south. Such a
manifestation of domestic love has
been rarely "met with twixt the north
ern and southern representatives in
the conventions of earlier growth. .
It was not until the town clock
told 4:20 that A. P. Fleming of Los
Angeles, chairman of the Los Angeles
committee of 100, called the conven
tion to order, the overdue contingent
still being delinquent. In~ a short
speech of welcome Fleming outlined
the causes of the call for the con
vention and introduced the Rev. War
ren D. Moore, who pronounced the in
vocation. Senator Joseph R. Know
land of Alameda and others then ad
vised the postponement of 'detail pro
ceedings until the arrival of the Los
Angelenos, with the exception of ef
fecting temporary organization. On
motion of W. R. Bacon, president of
the Southern California History So
ciety, A. P. Fleming was nominated
for temporary chairman. His unan
imous election followed, likewise 'that
of Mrs. A. P. Hill of San Jose',* as tem
porary secretary. A motion then pre
vailed that pending the evening ses-
Bibn tl\e chair appoint three commit
tees of five members each, one on cre
dentials, another, on permanent organ
ization and order of business and the
third on resolutions, the chair to re
port at the night session.

The officers had not searched *he
neighborhood long before their at
tention was . attracted . by cries , issufrg
from the deck of the Hecla. '
Upon their arrival at the schooner
they found McLaughlin. His accom
plice had made . good _ his escape. Mc-
Laughlin was taken to' the Central sta
tion, where,' they were booked on
charges of attempted robbery, robbery
and. carrying a concealed weapon. .As
yet. the other man has not been appre
hended.
William McLaughlin was caugrht in
the act of holding up Daniel Short on
board the scow schooner Heckia last
night by two police officers that were
looking, for him for another hold-up
that occurred earlier in the evening.
Shortly after 8 o'clock last night
Fred- Smith was held up by two men
on the corner of ' Third and Berry
streets. McLaughlin held a : re
volver before Smith, . while another
thief went through his pockets. It
developed that Smith had only 55
cents on his person, and .In a rage
McLaughlin struck him on the Jrfw
with his revolver.* '
Smith straightway notified the po
lice of his experience and Officers
Bruce and Connolly were detailed to
look for the thieves.

* ICEW YORK, April 19. â Colonel W.
I\ Clough. vice president and general
counsel of the Northern Securities
Company, when informed of the de
nial by the United States Circuit Court
at St. Paul of the petition by Messrs*
Fourthâ An intervention is not neces
sary to enable the petitioners to pro
tect any pecuniary interest or equity
they have. . -
Thirdâ The stock of the two railroad
companies is not in the custody of the
court.
Secondâ No one but the United States
can successfully appeal to the court to
enjoin thÂ«Â» execution of that plan, on
the proifnd that it is in violation of
the Sherman anti-trust act and the
United States expresses satisfaction
Tiith the present decree.
ST. PAUL. April 19.â In the United
States Circuit Court to-day Judges
tianborn, Thayer, Vanderventer and
Hook unanimously denied the applica
tion of E. H. Harriman and Winslow
Pierce and the Oregon Short Line Rail
w>ad Company, for leave to intervene
in the case of the United States against
the Northern Securities Company on
the following grounds: ""S
Firstâ The plan of the directors of
the Northern Securities Company for
the distribution of the stock of the
Great Northern and Northern Pacific-
Railway companies is not violative of
the decree in the Northern Securities
case.
Court Will Not Grant Peti
tion of Harriman in the
Northern Securities Case
DENIES RIGHT
TO INTERVENE
A representative of the Harriman in
terests said that the* decision is Just
what they 'expected it would be. The
suit was brought in the United States
Circuit Court merely as a matter of
form, so as to give Minnesota an op
portunity to exercise*Jurisdiction in the
case if it so desired.
"Our conclusion is that the petition
ers should not intervene and import
Into the case new issues to be tried.
The due enforcement of the decree
does not necessitate such action and
if it so happens that the decree of tn"is
court in favor of the Government
creates a situation which shall give
rise to controversies between stock
holders of the securities company as
to how the holdings of that company**
in the two railway companies ought to
be distributed or what "should be done
with such holdings, these are questions
which can be settled among the stock
holders themselves.
"Leave to intervene is denied."
"Applications for leave to intervene
in a case after the entry of 'a final de
cree are very unusual. They are never
granted as a matter of course, and
owing to the tendency of such app'i
cations to occasion delay and prolong
the existing legislation they ought not
to be granted unless it is necessary to
do so to preserve some right which
cannot otherwise be protected or to
avoid some complication that is liable
to arise. ],':!.â¢_; '<''Â¦ '.'
Harriman and Pierce regarding the
proposed stock distribution, said that
the result was just what he had ex
pected, but beyond that statement he
refused to express himself.
One of the counsel for the Northern
Securities Company said the decision
at St. Paul will 'merely throw the ap
plication for an injunction out of
court and any appeal would not carry
with it a stay of the proceedings, be
cause if it did so much a stay would
practically grant the injunction.
The court in discussing: the reasons
for the decree, after reciting the
grounds put forth by Harriman and
Pierce for leave to intervene, says:

PERSONAL.
OB EG OJT S 1 : D E LÂ£ G ATES : N DT \ B 0 U K D
It is obvious that since the accession of
Prrsiflent Roosevelt to the Presidency the
thoughtful sentiment of the country ha* be
come distrustful of his administration and
fearful of the consequences of his extraordi
nary erratic and autocratic assumption and
exercise or power. .
All that conservative men feared as a result
of hia acresalon to power ras come to pas*.
Safe dignified administration had plven way
to strenuous, ppectacular partisanship. Na
tional and International problems of vast im
port have become the sport of personal ambi
tion and have been fashioned and molded as
eifppine stone* to the Presidential eucc^ssion.
To-day the country finds tn Theodore Roose
vel* a standing menace to constitutional gov
ernment to international peace and to buFl
ness stability and prosperity. It turns to the
Democratic urbanization for safety and reliefâ
to that party of conservatism which from Its
birth and through so many years was the bul-
HARRISBURG. April 19. â After
dwelling at length upon the "political
wrong" perpetrated by the Republican
party in Pennsylvania and an alleged
attempt to discredit and dishonor our
Supreme Court "by making the high
est judgeship a mere perquisite of a
corrupt machine and a place of exile
or reward for those who hinder or
help its selfish purposes." the platform
adopted to-day by the Democratic
State convention says:
Platform Adopted at Harrisburg De
nounces Policy of President. .
SCORES ADMINISTRATION*.
At 2:45 o'clock the committee on per
manent organization reported on the se
lection of Senator A. G. Dewalt as per
manent chairman. The report was
adopted. Dewalt said in part:
"Unless sijrns of the times are falsely
read bv those who are deemed to know 1
something of public opinion, the time j
la ripe for the success of the great
Democratic party. Its principles and
Its platform should be to-day what they
have always been â a demand for hon
rsly and sanity in the administration
of public affairs and a cessation of
spectacular government T)y a President
â¢whose every move is made toward his
When the convention was called to
Order Frank J. Fitxslmmons was chosen
temporary chairman. He said that the
Republican party of Pennsylvania is
dead to State pride and individual lib
.erty, and that the serfs of the plains
of Siberia have more Independence than
have the "cringing machine-ridden and
boss-worshiping pack of slaves who be
long to the party given glory by Lin
coln and a long list of illustrious states
men."
After caustic reference to the "muz
xler bill" and Governor Pennypacker,
Fitzsimmcns closed with the statement
that "President Roosevelt is a constant
source cf unrest to the American peo
ple and a menace to the peace of the
country. He would like to build up a
new nation on his own ideals. He would
like to hav*e the senseless rough rider
take the place of common sense 'Uncle
Sam* find San Juan Hill substituted for
Bunker H11L"
The delegates at Jarre to the national
convention are Coload James Guffey.
State chairman; J. J. K. Pulsey, ex-
Governor Robert E. Pattison and Rob

The national delegates and electors
chosen, by the delegates from the Fif

contested. The contests were referred
to a committee to be appointed by State

FTTZSIMMONS TALKS.
BrARRXSBrRG. Pa-. April IS.â The
Democratic State Convention, which
TT&9 fceld here to-day, refused to !n
stract tnÂ« national delegates from
PesnsyJvanla to vote for the nomina
tion cf Judps Alton B. Parker of New
York for President- These delegates
vail go to St. Louis uninstructed and
-frill be bound tÂ»y the unit rule. An at
teicpt xvaÂ» made by the members of
the resolutions committee to amend the
platform by 1 substituting for the unit
rule plank a paragraph Instructing the
delegates for Judge Parker. It failed,
and the slatform as adopted by the
committee was unanimously adopted
by tne convention.
Justice Samuel Qustlae Thompaon^of
Philadelphia, was nominated by aoda-
Tnotirm for Supreme Court Justice
to succeed himself for the full term of
twenty-one years. He Is at present a
member of the Supreme Court by ap
pointment of Governor Pennypacker
-ti/4 >!<Â¦Â« commission win expire next
January.
Davis delivered a brief speech in sup
port of his amendment, which was re
jected by a viva voce vote, after which
the platform was adopted, and the con
vention adjourned.
"Resolved, That the delegates at
large from the State of Pennsylvania
to the National Convention of the
Democratic party to ' be held in the
city of St. Louis July 6, 1904. be and
the same are hereby Instructed to use
all honorable means by ballot and
otherwise to secure the nomination of
Hon. Alton B. Parker of New York for
President of the United States."
At the meeting of the resolutions
committee Park H. Davis of. North
ampton offered the following amend
ment to the plank relating to the unit
rule:
"This great feeling of uncertainty,-.
this widespread impression that the
President is not a Eafe man, that he
lacks poise and good judgment, has
caused the conservative and intelligent
voter of the country to again turn
his eyes to the Democrats for relief
and safety."
Dewalt also said that the Democrats
demand for the people of the country
an equitable revision of the tariff laws,
an increased navy to protect and in
crease our foreign commerce, liberal
and just pension laws and just laws
of taxation, so that the burden thereof
may be equally distributed and the fa
voring of some classes to the detriment
of other-3 may cease.
UNIT RUIiE STANDS, i
own succession In the White House.
The prudence, safety and patriotism
of a McKinley have given way to the
schemes of a Rough Rider, whose
strenuous methods have more than
once caused the nation to tremble lest
over night some act of his and through
him his party would cause all citizens
untold misfortune.
The platform instructs the delegates
to the national convention ."to vote as
a unit in all matters entrusted to their
charge."
Our rational strength should rather be ex
hibited In resisting the aggressions of great
powers than in browbeating the weak Ameri
can republics, whose guardianship and pro
tection we have so long assumed and main
tained. We favor the speedy completion of
the Panama canal, but regret that our Gov
ernment should have permitted this great pro
ject to be stained with evidence of dishonor
able Intrigue against the Integrity of a friend
ly republic. * "Â¦â¢'Â¦Â¦'Â¦Â¦
We deplore the continued existence, of. labor
troubles, affecting Important Industries ana
vast numbers of people, and express UwÂ»i earn-,
iÂ»st hope that through concession, arbitration.'
moderation and fair dealing early adjustment*
may be reached.
Labor unions organized for the betterment
Â©f the condition of wage-earners, acting with
in the limits of law and not subversive of pub
lie order or individual rights, are not only
lawful but commendable, and should be met,
recognized and dealt with accordingly.
While we recocnize the right of capital' in
all leiritimate lines of enterprise to combine
for the Increase of business, we believe that
by wise legislation, rigidly enforced j against
euch combinations, their evil tendencies can "be
prevented without needless destruction to the
capital upon which labor must depend for
employment and compensation. We believe
that a majority of the unlawful trusts now in
existence are the direct and natural result
of excessive Republican tariff 4uties. whicli
destrov competition and inevitably breed com
blrations for monopoly. To remedy this evil
should be one of the first purposes of tariff
revision. To such revision our party stands
pledged.
Federal taxation ' of all kinds should be
reduced. The enormous surplus accumulated
by the Government has. not only brought ex
trnvagance but has become a standing menace
to the financial stability of the country. The
entire currency conditions to-day, affecting all
business interests, are made to depend upon
the mood and whim of the Secretary of the
Treasury In his manipulation of the Govern
ment deposits. This condition Â¦ has become in
tolerable and should be remedied by reduction
of taxation.
liABOK AND CAPITAL.
We commend the declaration of Mr. Me-
Kinley in his last public addrese, -when he
said, "A system which provides a mutual ex
change of commodities is manifestly essential
to the. continued healthfulne6s and growth of
our export trade. We must not repose in fan
cied security that we can forever sell every
thing and buy little or nothingâ the period
of exclusiveness Is past. The expansion of
our trade and commerce is the pressing prob
lem; commercial wars are unprofitable; a pol
icy of. good will and friendly relations will pre
vent reprisals.'.'
- We stand for a Â«trict construction of all
Brants of powers that militate against the
liberty of the citizen and fcr a liberal con
struction on all reservations of his rights â for
home rule and local self-government, and
acalren centralization of the power â and for
the largest liberty to the individual consistent
with law and order, with protection of person
and property and the maintenance of govern
ment. We are opposed to paternalism in gov
ernment, to needless interference with the
rights, the liberties or condition of individuals,
and to all legislation that may hamper the
capabilities of the citizen or that may press
onÂ« individual or class with privileges or
power or restrictions not affecting others.
With Jefferson, we believe that the best
government is that which . governs least.
WÂ« declare our opposition to all schemes of
taxation that bear unequally upon individu
als or interests, or that tend to increase the
profits of one class at the expense of. another.
We are for llghening.it on â¢ the necessaries
of life and increasing it. if need be, only
upon the luxuries, always bearing . in mind
that the constitutional power to levy d'A,>s
on imports exists only for the purpose of rais
ing revenue.
TV'e declare our adherence to the fundamental
principles which Democracy has taught from
the foundation of our Government and which
are essential to the preservation : of our con
stitutional system.
ADHERE TO PRINCIPLES.
wark against' which- the spirit of sectionalism,
fanaticism, radicalism and the crude, wild
theories of experimentalists dashed in vain.
The Democratic party is to be congratulated
on the ract that we are now able to unite upor
the cardinal tenets of our party faith and their
application to the vital, pressing questions of
to-day.

ter, a prominent, merchant of Stayton,
attacked his wife yesterday, with a
knife and threatened to kill her. She
escaped to neighbors and afterward
made her way to her relatives a few
miles out of town. Trotter armed him
self with two guns this afternoon and
followed, vowing . that' he would kill
her. The officers organized a. posse and
are pursuing him, but at a late hour
had failed to locate the infuriated man.
He Is believed to be crazy, as his wife
moves in the best society. Trotter has
a quarrelsome disposition and recently
had several lawsuits over street* with

that when the posse finds him he will
fight to -the last, and sensational de

SANTA BARBARA, April 19.â A gen
eral understanding concerning the rates
for round-trip excursion tlcket3 to the
World's Fair at St. Louis and the days
upon which they may be sold probably
will be reached at the convention of the
Transcontinental Passenger Agents'As
sociatlon. now in session in this city.
Representatives of the passenger de
partment of nearly every railroad west
of Chicago are in attendance upon . the
convention, and it is generally conceded
that fixing rates for World's Fair travel
is the most important matter to be
considered.
Representatives of roads operating on
the Pacific Coast have been trying to
force the hand of Eastern passenger
agents and allow excursion tickets to
be sold from coast terminal points two
days a week instead of one, and in this
they probably will be successful.
The sessions are being held behind
closed doors. An effort will be made
to-morrow to adjust the pro rato rate
on transcontinental passenger business
and put it on a more. equitable basis,
satisfactory to all roads concerned. It
was decided to-day to hold the next
convention of the association at Chi
cago, some time in July, the exact date
to be determined later. .

OF BATTLE OF LEXINGTON*
Attorneys for Mrs. Ellen Nlgro and
her daughter, Madeline, believe that
they have put an effectual stop to the
contest begun against the probating
of the. will of the late Fabrizio Nigro.
owner of the Poodle Dog Restaurant
property in San Francisco, who left
property valued at $500,000. Judge
Greene sustained a demurrer filed by
them to-day and they take this as an
Indication that their points are well
taken, although their opponent has
leave to amend and try again.. .
The contest is brought on the gTound
that shortly before Xigro died; he was
declared incompetent. Jtfst before this
proceeding had been taken he made a
will in which he revoked a former will
and left everything he possessed to his
.widow and daughter. In his first will
he left his estate to Domenico and
Francisco Albertl of San Francisco, in
trust for the two heirs, the trustees
only to have control until the indebted
ness on the estate had been paid off.
The last will cuts the Albertis out of
the matter entirely. The contest 13
brought by them and they present the
first will as the legal will, alleging that
Nigro was incompetent to make a will
when the second was made.
The demurrer sustained to-day ob
jects to the Albertis' petition on the
ground that they are not interested as
heirs under either of the, wills, and for
thia reason are â¢ barred from bringing
a contest/

har, helped, has contributed his or her share
of effort and of loyalty. We have always had
In a remarkable degree a "working member
ship." This trait we must each studiously
cultivate, as individuals, as local circles and
In the Grand Circle. '
The story of the Women of Woodcraft con
tains these elements. In April, 1897, when our
order was organized by the seven men and
women who were called by circumstances to
thiii task there was no outward and visible
sign of the stature it would attain, the re
sults it would record, the splendid develop
ment it would be granted In seven tshoft years.
It* beginning was essentially small, common
place, humble. But there was faith and there
was granted the gift of persistency â the per
sistency which crawled when It could not walk,
walked when It could not run, picked itself
up when it stumbled, never knew when It was
whipped, moved always a step at a time and
each step forward. .
The results to-day are worth looking at. not
ti gather lazy or conceited content therefrom,
but to quicken our ambition and fire our en
thusiasm in the great work before us â for we
have only begun to grow, only touched the
outskirts of the work we arÂ« destined to do
fo.* the order, and through . the order for the
homes of the West, this great West of ours,
which is surely, if there is such a place, God's
own peculiar country.' Â¦
In seven years, starting* with no assets but
faith and persistency, we have paid death
claims to a grand total of $764,755â almost
$1,000,000. We have accumulated surplus as
sets above this enormous distribution of $236.
000. of which $19O,OUO is invested in interest
bearing bonds. We have gathered a member
ship of 42,000 in 5S2 communities of the nine
Pacific States.
From an unknown and unrecognized little
organization with no rating in the financial
world we have reached a point where our war

of the Women of Woodcraft opened
this evening with a banquet in honor
of the grand officers and the visiting
representatives, which was held at the
Malson de 1' Opera, at which addresses
were delivered by the grand guardian,
Mrs. C. C. Van Orsdall, and a num

among the speakers were:. Mrs. M.
E. Kline of Alameda; Dr. V. A. Der

J. T. Williams, guardian neighbor of

neighbors.
Â¦ The address of the evening was de
livered by Grand Guardian Carrie C.
Van Orsdall, who spoke of the growth
of the order in the past seven years.
She said, in part:
The story of all great achievements is a

WORK OF liAST YEAR
Remembering that the administration of the
government of a city is a vital matter as aJ
feotlng. Its most 4 desirable growth, may the
O&kland Jioard of Trade ever stand not only
for proerees' and expansion in -material things.
but for civic morality and for high ideals Â«f
government and citizenship.
It is a most hopeful indication that similar
commercial organization? in some of the
laiger cttto have. pt late turned thefr atten
tion to efforts for the correction of municipal
misrule and oomiwUrfi. from â¢which so many
of our American cities tave .griei-ously suf
fered in the past Â¦ and are .now suffering,
largely because of the apathy or indifference
of the prosperous merchant rlass and other
well-to-do citizens. Our board Is affiliated
with the National UunirlpaJ League, whose
object Is the uplifting of city politics, thus
showing fitor attitude of pyjjipathy with this
wtd< spread movement. . An organization of
thi 6 ktnd should never lend itself to the doing
of party eolitirg. but -it should ever stan>I
firmly and actively for clean businesslike
methods in government, .and Vhould strive to
t-8 Â«levate the plane of our politics that our
<-ompetent and successful business men may
not be repellrd therefrom but may be willing
to serve in nublic positions.
:n former years, recr ived the attention of the
board, and strenuous efforts halve been put
lorth to secure at the hands of Congress an
adequate appropriation for deepening the
jhip .channel. While our efforts :n this partic
ular s*etn destined to prove unavailing so far
**Â¦ action at the present cession te concerned,
en account of supposed political exigencies on
the eve of a. Presidential campaign, yet the
board r.ill not cease Its activities In this di
rection until this and other improvements for
the benefit of our water borne commerce are
accomplished.
The eubject at present .uppermost in the
nurd? of our citizens Is unquestionably that
cf municipal improvements. A new city hall,
r,f* Â«choolhouses, public parks, better streets,
end. according to the judgment of many over
ebadowinK all else In importance, a municipally
vwred water supply system â there are some
of the undertakings to which our citizens will
fhortly be asked to commit themselves by vot
ing for the Isyuanre of bonds to render pos
sible these accomplishments. This board stands
unquestionably committed .to a policy of public
improvements and wilt." "undoubtedly, render
\aluable service to that cause In the approach
ing campaign for Improvement "bonds.
W* have Jost completed what fcaa unques
tionably been the most prosperous year that
our organization has thus far Â¦enjoyed.
ThiÂ« condition. I believe, truly reflects the
general business prosperity and growth of
cur city, and in view of the financial and other
disturbances whirh tiav* caused the uasettle
ment and curtailment of business In fome of
the older sections of the country, it is found
especially gratifying.
The work to which this Board of Trade haa
pt^-lrtrtitly devoted itselfâ that of building
Â«p Oaklanfl by making her advantages more
widely knor.n. bringing tourists from the
Mast and promoters of new entcVprises wltbln
her borders, has of late met with a more
hearty appreciation on the part of our mer
chant's, bankers, property owners and profes
*:on&l men, ae evidenced by a substantial in
crfÂ»!Â»e Jn our membership from all these
classes. We comtnenoed the year with three
hundred. At itB close our number is five hun
dred and twelve active and Interested mem

The new theory is hung upon the
fact that the Werrens have had quar
rels with their neighbors over cattle.
George F. Weeks, editor of the Ala
meda Daily Encinal, relates a conver
sation he overheard about a year ago
while returning from an outing in
Wildcat Canyon with his son, Walter
R. Weeks, and Leo Brown of 1400
Louisa 6treet. The trio had stopped
at the Werrens for refreshment and
while there Mr. and Airs. Werren quar
reled with a man over the theft of some
cattle of the Werrens.
"From what I could gather," said
Mr. Weeks to-day, "the Werrens had
accused the man of stealing their cows.
The man wanted a retraction, but Mrs.
Werren insisted that. he was the thief.
This angered the man so that he
threatened to strike the woman, but
the interference of my son prevented it.
"It is Just possible that this shoot
ing is the outgrowth of that' quarrel.
I know it happened a year ago, but
then people .nurse their wrongs a long
time."
In her excitement since the shooting
Mrs. Werren has declared that she
knew the identity of her assailant. She
did not refer to any quarrel -with neigh
bors, however, but to a man who
wished to establish a saloon rear the
Werren place. The man had asked the
couple to sign his application, but they
had refused. But Werren himself de
clares this to be most unlikely, observ
ing that it is a mere suspicion of his
wife's. He refuses to name the man to
whom his wife refers.
All the circumstances in the case in
dicate that it was only a well laid plan
for robbery. It is very like the hold
up that occurred recently In a Fruit
vale store and officers who have worked
on the case declare that the same man
acted in both places.
Mrs. Werren's condition was some
what improved to-day, bo Dr. J. Ed
son Kelsey, the attending physician,
said. There is always the danger of
pneumonia, however, and the woman
is by no means out of danger.
Another day has passed and the as
sailant of Mrs. Elizabeth Werren at
the Werren saloon Sunday night is
still free. Sheriff Bishop has about
abandoned the quest of the highway
man, there being absolutely no clew
to follow, and as no serious attempt
was made on the part of any. other
officers to apprehend the criminal it
may be said that he does not even en-
Joy the distinction of being pursued.
The rather improbable theory has
bobbed up now that the shooting was
done not by a highwayman, but by an
enemy of the Wen-ens seeking revenge.
All the circumstances that brand it
as a deliberately planned hold-up are
being overlooked In order to support
this theory- The. man and his two pis
tols, his masked face, his demands for
xaised hands, the killing of the Wer
rens' dog and finally the shooting of
Mrs. Werren are either Ignored or ex
plained as simply bluffs to cover; up
the real nature of the crime. But the
fact remains that Mrs. Werren prob
ably would not have been shot had
she obeyed the bandit's commands to
stand still.

to use every earnest effort to impress upon the
public the real purpose for which this day is
set aside, in order that we may all join -with
patriotic fervor In showing our high regard

who. though not here in life, influence ua by
their worthy example of love to country. Let
not their brave services be forgotten upon
this- day so especially set aside to decorate

The amendment providing for the
erection of an office and committee
room building for the use of Senators
was opposed by Berry, who said that
before it could be completed the build
ing would cost not less than 543,000 or
550,000 each for the members of the
Senate. This he pronounced "a piece
of extravagance which surpassed any
thing he had ever seen offered in the
Senate."
Bailey supported the amendment. He
said that Berry's comment as to the
cost of the proposed building might be
applied to the Capitol. That building
had been erected for the Congress as a
whole, and he considered the best nope
to good in the way of accommodations.
He did not want- Oriental magnifi
cence, but he did want splendid build
ings. Senators in Washington should
not live in huts nor stop at wagon
yards; nor should they have their
offices in inaccessible portions of the
Capitol.
Teller opposed the east front exten
sion, but advocated the new building,
saying that as the country grows, de
mands on the Capitol will grow. He
expressed the opinion that the time
would come when it would ba necessary
to provide accommodations for Sena
tors for Alaska and Porto Rico, and
save voice to the hope that it might be
necessary to make room for" Senators
from what is now the Dominion of
Canada.'
Trie Senate went into executive ses
sion and at. 5:20 p. m. adjourned.
A report will also be received from
Gifford Pinchot, chief of the forestry
division of the United States Depart
ment of Agriculture. W. S. Mellick,
secretary of the State Board of Ex
aminers, who has had the handling of
the State appropriation, will tell what
has been done by the State. Beyond
this there is no fixed programme for
the convention, but undoubtedly there
will be much discussion of the several
phases of the work of the association
and of those that are proceeding along
the same lines. A report will be made
by Chief Justice Beatty, who is pres
ident of the association.
The annual convention of the Cali
fornia Water and Forest Association
will be held in the y rooms of the

the irrigation investigation of the

Speaker Cannon further convulsed
the House when he asked: "Is there
any other gentleman who desires the
bill read?" I^ v -
Mr. Williams, the minority leader,
jocularly inquired if the Speaker's de
cision had been arrived at "after con
sultation." The Speaker promptly .re
plied that it had been, and set the
House in an uproar when he added:
"The skilled parliamentarian who has
been at this desk for many years can
give the chair," and after a pause,
"and the gentleman from Mississippi,
cards and spades and then have a
fount'ain of parliamentary knowledge
left." It was some moments before the
applause which greeted this "sally sub
sided. Mr. Maddox of Georgia demand
ed the reading of the bill, which was
begun, but later he withdrew his re
quest.
Delegate Wilson of .Arizona asked If
New Mexico, with all her resources,
would not prefer individual statehood,
to which Mr. Rodey replied that his
views were well known and that if
the people did not like the measure
they had the privilege of voting it
down, "as the election expenses were
to be paid by the Government." -He
predicted that in 1910 New Mexico
would have a population of 1,000,000 and
closed with an earnest plea for the pas
sage of the bill. The third reading of
the bill had been directed by the
Speaker, whereupon Mr. Moon, in
quired If the third reading was to be
by title only. In the midst of an elab
orate discussion the Speaker turned to
the parliamentarian, Mr. Hinds, for
further advice, and then announced
that he would resolve the whole ques
tion in favor of the individual privi
lege of each member, any one of whom
could demand the reading of the bill.
The debate was closed by Rodey of
New Mexico, who said that, while the
bill did not suit the people of his Ter
ritory, they nevertheless acquiesced in
it. He explained In great detail the
resource : of both Arizona and his own
Territory, and inquired if agriculture
alone were necessary to support a pop
ulation. He obtained great applause
when he cited New Tork City with its
great population, which, he said, did
not produce a potato.
XEW 3IF-YICO'S PROSPECTS.
Russell of Texas criticized the plan
for the division of the delegates to the
constitutional convention of the State
of Oklahoma, which, he said, proceed
ed on the rule of .eliminating from the
population of Indian Territory the In
dians of the five civilized tribes.
Grosvenor of Ohio was open in his
expressions of disapproval of the bill,
but said that, as the United States was
a country of parties, and as parties
spoke through the caucuses, he would
vote for the bill.
In a brief speech in support of the
bill, Curtis of Kansas insisted that the
Indians of the five civilized tribes and
the whites | of Indian Territory were
ready for statehood, and that 90 per
cent of the Indians were in favor of
joint statehood with Oklahoma. While
stating that the bill did not exactly
conform to his Idea of what was want
ed by the people of Oklahoma, JJc-
Guire declared that should it pass there
would not be a vote against it either
in Oklahoma or Indian Territory.
Republican opposition, to. the bill
came from Needham of California,
who, while entering no protest against
the union of Oklahoma and Indian
Territory^ vigorously attacked the
proposition for Joint statehood in Ari
zona and New Mexico.
In opposing the union of Arizona
and New Mexico Wilson declared that
such union, against the will of the
people, was ultra-radical in policy
and was a political revolution in both
legislation and policy.

He was generally considered a rich man,
but It will be a surprise to many to know
that Samuel Davis was a millionaire. His life
was as unostentatious as his charity, and
speaking about hU kindly disposition Ej may
say that but few actually knew the extent cf
h:s giving. He was generous to his unfortunate
fellowman. but never allowed any one to know
of his generosity. If It became known that he
â¢lid a friend a rood turn It was never from
his own lips. Apart from his property, a good
deal of which is in the Potrero, he left $100,
00V in cash.

GILT EDGE SECURITIES.
Samuel Davis was 77 years of age. He was
bcrn at Gallway. Saratoga County, New Tork.
and came to California In 1SS3, then being the
possessor of flWO. He speculated in Sierra
County scrip and securities and during the
war speculated In greenback bonds. In 1MS3
he came to fc'an Francisco with and
lent money at good interest. He got hold of
Indian war bond* issued by the State of Cali
fornia and on that alone he made $50,000.
The will was filed in the Superior
Court yesterday and accompanying it
was a petition by Julius Reis that the
document be admitted to probate and
he be granted letters of administration.
The petition states that the estate
is worth more than $1,000,000 and that
the only relatives of deceased are Jane
Davis, a sister, Mrs. Mary Stone, his
niece, and Henry W. Davis, a nephew,
all residing in Churchville, New York.
The petition states that deceased was
never married and that he has no other
relatives other than the persons named.
Reis has already been appointed spe
cial administrator of the estate and he
secured letters a few days after the
death of Davis.
Speaking of the late Mr. Davis yester
day, Attorney Cowdery said:
His mode of living was frugal and
he resided in onejroom situated at 40S
California street and probably his most
intimate friends were, Julius Reis and
Attorney J. F. Cowdery. â¢ â¢
Davis left a will entirely in his hand
writing. It was executed in February.
1S9S. , It Is a peculiar last testament in
that it does not contain the name of
a single devisee or dispose .of any of
his estate and simply names Reis, his
long time friend, as executor of the
will, and provides that in the event
of his death or refusal to serve
the office shall devolve upon the Union
Trust Company.
A WEAL/THY ESTATE.
When Samuel Davis died on April 5
last at Lane Hospital there was not
one at his bedside who dreamed that
the septuagenarian had accumulated
and left an estate valued at more than
$1,500,000.
Daria- ,was known as one of the
"strange men" of the city. His inti
mate friends always thought him well
to-do and by almost all his acquaint
ances he was considered a man who
guarded whatever he was possessed of
with extreme dosenesa.^ But few were
given the privilege of knowing Samuel
Davis.

A sensational verdict was rendered
in the inquest room of the Morgue yes
terday afternoon, when a Jury, consist
ing of G. W. Rumble, foreman, K. A.
Mueller. J. J. Kiibride. J. Q. Hatch,
Julius A. Elchorn, Charies W. Guild.
I~ C. White and J. Elm charged Dr.
G. F. Brackett. chief surgeon of the
Emergency Hospital. with having
charged fees for services rendered ip
the capacity cf city Burgeon.
The case upon which the charge is
founded is that of a. HL Ames, who
subsequently died from injuries re
ceived in an elevator accident at the
store cf A. Fleishhacker & Co., 17-13
S utter street.
On the afternoon of February 13
Ame*. an employe at the Fleishhacker
firm, met with an accident while run
ning a freight elevator. The ropes cf
the machine failed to work properly
and Ames' foot was caught between
the elevator and the floor. He was re
moved to the Emergency Hospital, then
transferred to the German Hospital,
where he diÂ»Â»d on February 24.
Directly" after tHe accident, Fleish
hacker. the employer of the injured
man. called up Dr. Brackett. telling
him that he had a personal friend, one
Dr. Huntington. whom he would like to
have on the case. Dr. Brackett an
swered that he was willing to meet
Dr. Huntington In consultation, pro
vided Fleishhacker pay him (Brackett)
the sum of $5. consultation fee.
Fleishhacker says that rather than
have ar.y dispute he paid Brackett.
Huntington asked that the injured man
be removed to a ward in the City and
County Hospital, where Huntington
might give the case his close atten
tion, but Brackett objected, saying that
Th? operation must be performed at
th* Emergency Hospital.
Brackett next visited Mrs. Ames,
wife cf the patient, telling her that it
would be impossible to have the man
removed to Huntington's hospital* and
that the best plan would be to permit
Brackett to have sole charge of the
case.
Mrs. Ames agreed to let Brackett
have the case and consented to his
performing the operation.
Brackett then telephoned to Fleish
hacker to the effect that 5100 would be
needed for medicines and incidentals,
but that he did not want the money
in the form of a fee. Fleishhacker
â¢neutly refused to pay the money and
was later notified by an attorney that
h* would be made to stand the ex
jonsee of the case.
M. Fleishhackrr told the following
story on the witness stand:
A. H. Ames, an en-.p!oyÂ» cf my firm, 54
:-eÂ«rs of ace. Â»Â« injured by our freight ele
vator on the 13th of last February. There
were n.> witnesses to the accident 'a.n<i it is
â¢ matter ct speculation how the mishap oc
curred.
DOCTOR SEIZES CASE.
Directiy after the accident Ainea waa re
r:*-\Â»Â«j to the Central EianEMiry Hospital,
where he waa received by Dr. Brackett. I
telephoned to BraeJwtt and asked him hew
>^r:ous the mans injuries were. He informed
ic^ that it might be necessary to amputate
< t;Â«? leg as tie foot was badly crushed. I
then asked If Brackett would have any objec
tions to ray calling in. Dr. Huntisston. la
whose abilities as a surgeon I have great faith.
Kracketf said he had not the slightest objc:
ticn'to meeting an outside doctor in consulta
tion, but that I must pay Brackett the cus
tomary S3 consultation fee.
Rather than have trouble I paid the, money
and nctiffed Huntington of the accident. Tl'hen
ll was decided to operate Hur.tington asked
that a rr.es be removed to the City aad County
Hospital, where the doctor could give the case
constant attention. Bracken objected etrenu
rusly and Â«aid the man could r.et be removed
without the approval cf the hospital authori
ties.
Brackett n?xt asked me for $100 for in
cidental expenses In the case. I refused to pay
tin* and was later notified by an attorney by
f!?e name of Abbott that he would like to see
me. I feel sure that Abbott represented
Hratkftt. Brarkett later toM me that he had
t^eer. given permission by Mrs. Ames to per
'enn the operation and that owing to the
financial embarrassment of the Ames family
hÂ» would perform the operation free of charge
provided I pay fcim the incidental expenses, i
s.Â«!n refused to pay the uaoc&t ar.d Bracket
f'JII came hack with the proposition that he
wÂ«?u!<J gÂ»t Mrs. Ames to relieve us of the re-
for 5100.
SAYS FIRM IS TO BLAME.
Dr. Brackett took the witness stand
|nd claimed that the elevator upon
which Ames was riding was over
loaded. The doctor tried to place the
blame upon the Fleishhacker firm. Em
ployes of that firm that were the first
to see the injured man and the ele
vatcr say that there was absolutely
nothing on the elevator.
Owing to illness Mrs. Ames was un
able to appear at the Inquest.
Ames was finally removed to the
German Hospital under the care of
Brackets He died on the 24th of Feb
ruary.
The jury exonerated the firm of
A. Fleishhacker &. Co. from all blame
and rendered the following verdict:
During the progress of our Investigation of :
this rase it oasne to our notice that L>r. Brack
'tt. the bÂ«ad surjeon Â»t the City Receiving
Hospital, first demanded a. consultation fee of
*j for himself, which was paid by M. Fletsb
hackÂ»r. Before allowing Dr. HunUnffton the
privilege or a consultation the Bald Dr. Hunt- !
lrjrtcn. the chief surgeon of the medical de
partment of the University of California, hav
ing be^n called by M. Fleishhacker of the firm
of A. Fieishhacker St Co. to render what *<Â«r- :
vice* ho could for the injured employe at the
IleceiviE* Hospital, and that Dr. Brackett
further placed obstacle* in the way of remov
ing the patient to Dr. Huntington's ward la â¢
tin? City c-.d County Hospital. Dr. .Brackett
also influenced the wife of the deceased to give
the caw- to himself, and after pettier it ap
proached M. Fleishhacker with a proposition to
â¢rive him the sum of $100 for incidentals, etc..
in the treatment of the case, which waÂ» re
fused.
That Pr. Bracken afterward amputated the
IrÂ«T at the Central Emergency Hcwpital. after
which the patient was removed to the German
Hospital, where he di<?d. That after the death
an attorney, pent presumably through the.In
fluence of I>r. Brackett. called en the firm of
A. Flelshharker & Co.. demanding 1 damages in
this case. We. the jury, desire to call the
attention of the public to the, disgraceful prac
tice of th!Â« public institution, and also to call
the attention of the honorable Board of Health
to chapter 3. section 2. of the charter of the,
city and county of San Francisco, pertaining
to accepting feee and the penalty therefor.

Dr. G. F. Brackett teas Been last
night and he said:
Mr. Anieg was brought to the Central Hos
pital on February 13 suffering from a com
pound comminuted fracture of both bones of
the right leg. Immediate amputation was sug
gested, but permission for such could not be
obtained. Mrs. Ames was sent for, and com
municated wtth Mr. Fleishhacker. who asked
that ejich an cr>eration be deferred until Dr.
Huntington be sent for in consultation.
Dr. Huntlsgton suggested to the patient that
he might go to the City and County Hospital,
where he would have to keep <j'JiÂ»t for months,
with a possibility of then having to have an
amputation, or he could submit to the opera
tion at "once. The patient rreferred tÂ» sub
mit to the operation at once, and I was asked
to go ahead with the work. After three days'
stay Â«n the hospital the patient was removed
to the German Hospital, where he died. As
regards charging cf a fee for work performed
in the hospital. I deny the charge: nor did I
ever attempt to collect one. Mr. Fleishhacker
ar.d Mrs. Ames thoroughly understood that
what I did was purely from kindly motives.

Prager Company Leases En-

Market and Jones Streets
â¢
TVOEK BEGINS AT ONCE
â¢
Will Include Every Modern
Convenience and Will Be
One of the City's Chief At-
tractions.
?
One of the proofs of the wonderful
progress this city is making is shotrn by
the expansion of Prager's Department
Store to include the entire Murphy
Building, at Market and Jones streets,
for its business.
This store is the youngest of the large
retail establishments in the city, being
in existence only a little over a year and
a half, and yet Its patronage has In-
creased so rapidly and to such an extent
that the first floor and immense base-
ment tvhi<-h it has been occupying jare
inadequate to accommodate the trade.
This Department Store, when finished,
will bo the realization of the cherished
plan of the late Daniel T. Murphy, sen-
ior member of the firm of Murphy.
Grant & Co. Before the building was
oompleted Mr. Murphy died and his orig-
inal intentions could not be carried out.
Its uppor floors being turned into offices.
Its location Is. without doubt, the finest
in the city and within a short time will
b*Â» the shopping <-entcr. The new post-
offlce. theater and other great enter-
prises are being completed in this sec-
tion.
Prager's Department Store will have a
frontage of 'nearly one-half a block on
Market FtrtÂ»et and will extend hack 275
feet on Jones. There will be every
known item of merchandise .in existence
under its roof, and features never before
seen in the West will be instituted. No
expense will be spared to make it one of
the most attractive and modern estab-
lishments in the world- Every conven-
ience Iknown will be there. There will
be a cafe and telegraph, telephone and
postal facilities and rapid elevators to
all floors. In tbe%dome at the top of the
building will.be a luxurious lounging-
room for women, where appointments
with friends may be kept. It will have
a beautiful outlook of the entlreclty.
One of the greatest features, and one
rarely found in department stores, will
be a separate entrance to the men's and
boys' clothing and furnishing depart-
ments. This will lrad from Jones street
and will overcome the necessity of pass-
Ing through women's departments.
The members of the Prager Company
and Daniel and Eugene. B. Murphy, with
Judge J. G. Maguire. representing the
heirs of the Murphy estate, closed the
transaction a few days ago, and already
the tenants are vacating the upper por-
tion of the building. Work will com-
mence Immediately and at the latest the
new store will be ready for the fall bust-

LONDON newspapers giving, detailed reports of the
recent mass meeting held in Hyde Park to protest
against opening South Africa to Chinese labor
show that the occasion was one of much more impor
tance than appeared from the brief accounts given in the
cable dispatches. The day was by no means pleasant for
such a gathering, being cold and misty, but none the
less, according to estimates of the Westminster Gazette,
upward of 50,000 workingmen marched m .procession
to the park from various quarters, while thousands of
others joined" them there, so that when the, bugle calls
for order sounded fully 80,000 people were r gathered
around the fourteen platforms "from which addresses
were to be made and resolutions moved.
Among the notable features of the demonstration were
the sentiments emblazoned upon the numerous banners
carried in the parade. One bore the words: -"Parlia
mentary Committee Trade Unjpn Congress, organized to
protest against slave labor." -Another was -inscribed:
"Slavery abolished 1833, revived 1904, after the sacrifice
of 52,000 men, women and children." A third bore the
legend: "We demand work for starving white men in
South Africa." A fourth demanded: "Are the mine
owners to be permitted to paint South Africa a\) yellow?"
Qnite a number bore the inscription: "Freedom of la
bor. No slavery under Ihe British flag."
' The words of the banners were significant of the tone
of the speeches that were to followl From first to .last,
the efforts of all were directed toward arousing antagon
ism to the employment of Chinese in South Africa on the
ground that it would mean a revival of slavery. The res
olutions adopted declared: "This meeting, consisting of
all classes of citizens of London, emphatically protests
.against the action of the Government in granting permis
sion, to import into. South Africa indentured Chinese
labor tinder conditions of slavery, and calls upon them
v to protect this new colony from the greed of capitalists
and the empire from degradation."
The orafors fiercely scored every noted man who had
voted in Parliament for the Chinese bill. Even the
Archbishop of Canterbury was not spared. A reporter
of the Daily News' in describing^the speech of John
Burns, the famous labor leader, who was the bright par
ticular star of the occasion, says of his references to
the head of the church:
"As I come up Mr. Burns is dealing faithfully â very
faithfully â with the Archbishop of Canterbury. The
crowd is reveling in the enjoyment of his fierce, and tell
ing 'but always just and human strokes. 'The Archbishop
must^ake a new title,' says Burns;â c the Chaplain to the
Chinese Compounds.' A roar from the crowd. 'He
speaks of it as a "regrettable necessity." He was an
ticipated in that phrase by another great manâ Charles
Peace, the burglar-murderer. When- Charles Peace was
about, to be condemned for" his crimes he said to" his
counsel, "I repeat that I have never taken human life
except: from regrettable necessity."' This time an im
mense roar swept the crowd as the point was accurately
andcarefully thrust home by quotations from a written
paper. -The roar was repeated again and again."
The opposition press of course promptly 'took up the
voice of the' protest of the workingmen, and proceeded
next morning to edit it with all the vigor at
their command. It is . quite f likely, therefore, that
the * effect of the meeting will be , to ma
terially weaken the prestige of the Government
among the workingmen of London and indeed through
out the" kingdom. It is a formidable issue for the'Min
istry to meet, inasmuch as it enables the opposition to
appeal to such varied and potent sentiments as race
prejudice against Chinese, the antagonism felt by large
numhers ..of people to the schemes of the big mine
owners of the Rand, and the high sentiment <v of indigna
tion that exists among ,all classes against anything that
even looks like a Tevival. of slavery. v
THE HYDE PARK- PROTEST.
A farmer near Corvallis, Ore., has lately been botheTed
by bears. He stood it patiently until he found one/of
his cows and a calf killed by them. That was too much,
.so, he got an ax, hunted up the bear family and chopped
up an old bruin and two half-grown cubs. He says his
dander is up and if they don't let him alone he will take
a gun to them next time! ;
"We are always full up here," said
one of the attendants to the writer.
"And we shall continue to be as long

eame system were introduced \ here , we
should immediately ret rid of one-half
of opr able bodied paupers."
Meanwhile the Marylebone , rate-
. Dr. Uayner. the medical officer to
the institution, stated that the camples
Â©f hereditary pauperism cited were by
no means exceptional. "An intimate
acquaintance with the inner life of
workhouses," he said, "reveals many
things which can only be described as
grotesque."
The Marylebone workhouse iÂ» spot
lessly clean. All its rooms are com
fortably heated by steam. It is equip
ped with all the latest up-to-date im
provement* in the matter of ventila
tion and sanitation. It ha* now near
ly 2000 inmates. ,
Another equally instructive example
is furnished by a family named Glass.
Glass and his wife entered the work
house some twenty years ago and
there settled down. Their son was
sent to the pauper school at Southall
und received an education with the
addition of such frills as are there
deemed necessary to fit the scions of
the lazy to become future ornaments
uf society. In due time young Glass
was turned loose on the world to shift
lor himself. He erot married and then
with his wife shifted to fche workhouse
where misguided beneficence solves
the problem of existence for him and
relieves him of the necessity of work
ing for a living.
"J be fairly comfortable." said the
grandfather, when inquiries were
made a* to his welfare at the work
house, "fairly comfortable." But he
added after a moment, thinking thaj
lie had conceded too much to the in
stitution which had sheltered and
clothed him for thirteen years, "things
might be a bit better; yes, they might
be a bit better."
The second daughter. Kate, now
about 30 years old, has never encum
bered herself with a husband, finding
that the workhouse renders such un
certain aid in the struggle for exist
ence superfluous. Her four (illegiti
mate) children* were born there. Three
of them died. The surviving child, a
boy. is now on the Shaftsbury training
ship, being trained for a sailor, Ma
rylebone taxpayer* meanwhile defray
ing the expense of his maintenance.
Most considerate of the family, Jo
hanna, the third daughter, has con
tented herself with only occasionally
burdening the workhouse with the
cost of her own keep. At present she
is not a guest there.
Three daughters they had who were
not slow to emulate their parents' ex
ample and profit by Marylebone's civic
hospitality. One of them, Elizabeth,
!<rought with her her husband, a man
named Lawcs. She died in the work
houso. but her four children' a^re being

In MaryleboGe there has just been
brought to light a striking illustration
of the natural consequences of its sys
tom of pampering pauperism. In 1891
P&lrick Downs, a day laborer, by be
ing turned out of home for non-pay
ment of rent, acquired the necessary
statutory qualifications of destitution
which entitled him to relief for the
asking and accordingly he entered one
of the Marylebone workhouses. There
he has lived ever since freed from the
necessity of hustling for a living and
incurring no risk of being evicted. A
few months after his admission his
wife. Catherine, charmed fey his re
ports of the ""soft snap" he had found,
obtained admission to the same hos

since resided.

all records for long runs in London an
the part of musical plays. A touch
of pathos was given to the : occasion,
however, by the death of Ernest Boyd
Jones, who was the original Lord Chan
cellor of the piece. The comedy was
produced first on October 4, 1901, and
Boyd Jones played in It nightly up to
the nine hundred and. eighty-eighth

with pleurisy. "I shall not live to see

marked pathetically a few days before
his death.
HEADQUARTERS OF THE CALL,
5 HENRIETTA STREET, COVENT
GARDEN. LONDON. April S. â Play
goers here welcomed the announce
ment, made the other day, that the
Shaftesbury Theater, where "The
Belle of New York" ran for 700 nights,
is about to become the permanent
London home of American musical
comedy, but probably few who heard
of the scheme were without misgiv
ings as to its result. Theatrical para
gxaphists, of course, pretend to see in
the plan another step toward the
"Americanization" of the Condon
stage, but the "Americanization of the
London stage" has been promised
many times and nothing has come of
it. And the unfortunate part of it
is that the stage here can be "Amer
icanized" to a rather large extent if
only the thing were gone about in the
right way. It is a fact that Londoners
are, in the vernacular, "dead anxious"
to patronize good American attrac
tions, but they have had no end of
disappointments. Heretofore Amer
ican managers almost invariably have
invited failure â when a piece from
across the water has scored over here
â by following it with one or more in
different productions. Never was there
a better chance for continuous money
making by Americans than that which
offered itself after the run of "The
Belle of New York." London was
eager for "more of the same" â and
got "An American Beauty," which had
been a frost at home. . "The Casino
Girl," which followed the old Lillian
Russell play at the Shaftesbury, made
partial amends, but "The Belle of Bo
hemia," next in order, proved a feeble
thing enough. Then came the open
ing of the new Adelphi, with, it was
announced, another "delightful Amer
ican musical comedy," and "The Whirl
of the Town" was given, bored a first
night audience and lived about a fort
night. Result, American playg at a
discount. "DollÂ»- Varden" failed in
London and its author went back and
told American interviewers that' the
metropolis would have none of jtrans-
Atlantic musical comedies,. But the
company which gave "Dolly Varden"
here was not an adequate one, and
Americans who saw the piece at *the
Avenue foresaw its failure: As for
Julian Edwards* statement that Lon
don audiences don't want American
plays, it need only be pointed out
that "In Dahomey" ran at the Shaftes-,
bury for, 250 nights after "Dolly Var
den" had collapsed. "Sherlock
Holmes" ran ten or eleven months.
"The Darling of the Gods" has passed
its hundredth performance at His
Majesty's.
George Musgrave, the proprietor of
the Shaftesbury, cays he will begin his
new experiment by producing "The
Prince of Pilsen," and tnat he Intends
to give only plays that have been real
successes at home. He promises, too,
that these shall be given by capable
American actors, and If Mr. Musgrave
lives up t^this programme the chances
for success are all in his favor. As
a matter of fact, there seems no Jimit
to the business that can be done by
American plays, especially musical
ones, here in London, if only the pieces
have merit and are well done. Half
the song hits in the London musical
plays at present are "lifted'* from
American successes. "Sammy" is the
piece de resistance of both "The Love
Birds" and "The Earl and the Girl,"
In the latter of which "My Cozy Cor
ner 1 Girl" and another American song
also are sung. William Jerome's "Be
delia" â with new words by George
Grosmith â is given in "The Orchid"
(without credit), and American "busi
ness" is worked into several other
plays.
H. V. Esmond* actor and playwright,
â¢who wrote "When We Were Twenty-
One" and "Imprudence," has not aoted
in London since he was seen in Henry
Arthur Jones' play "Chance, the Idol,"
but he is to reappear in "The House of
Burnside" when Edward Terry produces
that play early in April. Esmond was
hailed . as the coming Pinero a while
ago, but thus far has not made good.
"When We Were Twenty-One" seems
to have been a success at home, but
it failed in London. Esmond's "Senti
mentalist" had a similar fate, and his
comedy, "Billy's Little. Love Affair,"
soon petered out at the Criterion, what
ever William Faversham and Fay Da
vis may have made of it in the United
States. **

tured underwear several members of
the royal family of Patagonia arrived
here yesterday oa^Jhe. steamship Cel
tic- They did not occupy the royal
suite aboard the steamship. . but were
quartered under an open hatch in the
steerage, where they received plenty
of fresh air. which they need. But
even in their lowly quarters they
showed their royal blood by keeping
aloof from the other passengers dur
ing the voyage.
"In the party are five men, a woman
and a little girl. The men are all
more than six feet in height, and are
built in proportion. Their features
are very much like those of the Amer
ican Indian. The woman also looked
much like an Indian squaw, but thfe
little girl was a picture. She Is 12
years old, with a bronze colored com-
Ijlexlon and very red cheeks- Her
hair is jet black and hangs in dis
order about her face. Almost every
part of her was covered by' ornaments
and strings of beads, under which she
wore a rough dress of guanaco hide,
which hung loose from her shoulders.
Her feet were incased in shoes which
were given her by a passenger on the
steamship. ,
"The whole party is en route to the
St. Louis Exposition, where they will
form the population of the Patagonian
village. T,hey first wejit from their
homes to Buenos Ayres, ' then by
steamship to Liverpool, where they
were placed aboard the Celtic. When
they left their homes, according to the
custom of their land, they wore white
bands about their, heads, .and scanty
robes and shoes of guanaco skin, but
nothing more. Their guide, a young
Peruvian who had lived with them for
years, and to whom their living pic
ture style of costume did not seem ex
traordinary, led them as they were
aboard the Celtic." .
When the beholder looks upon the boots he is seized
with despair. It grips him like a mental colic, for he
feels that no volunteer will offer to put on those fallen
monuments of the cordwainer's art, and, therefore, El
phus primogenius will continue to tear the flag and the
dilapidation of the temples will go on. But the rest of
the page and all of the obverse are filled with text, from
which we learn that Mr. Hearst's feet exactly fit those
boots! With them on he engages to go fearlessly to
combat with the terrible and extinct animal, and do up
that companion of the long dead dodo in one round!
Incident to this athletic offer, be remarks with great
earnestness and in large and audible type: "The ambi
tion to earn the esteem of others leads away, from St.
Helena, but it opens up a path of true usefulness." That
path he is willing to tread in those boots. The allusion
to St. Helena may be obscure, but the boots are there
in the picture, and the people are told that, "humbly
following in his footsteps, another Lincoln appears,, as
Abraham Lincoln appeared, at^the. moment of greatest
need."
So, it is evident that William Randolp*h Hearst Abra
ham Lincoln is abroad in the land, and if we Were the
legal advisers of the extinct animal with the curved
tusks we would counsel him to pipe all hands to quarters
and clear his decks for action. We cannot close this with

pelled to proclaim his equality with Lincoln. Perhaps
this explanation is tedious, but it seemed due to the
subject, for boots. were used also by Bombastes.
The rhyme runs on until "burst," "nursed," "worst,"
and ail the words that will rhyme with Hearst are ex
hausted. It is a strong lyric, and well sung, with a banjo
accompaniment, is a call to duty not excelled by any
noise thus far heard in the campaign. But the fertile
genius of Mr. Hearst, inspired by the ambition to be
President, does not stop at the use of one of the arts.'
Music, heavenly maid, is a good girl among the muses,'
but there are others. Having invoked Euterpe, Mr.
Hearst prevents jealousy in the family of Zeus, who
fathered the muse. family, by bringing Clio into action,
with history, to give his campaign a solid foundation.
As a result we find spread upon the vast editorial page
of his New York paper a cartoon, legend and text, of an
awe-inspiring quality. In the left foreground stands a
mammoth, the Elphus primogenius, a tusker at that. It
is a front view. Across the head is the word "Trusts,"
and this terrible though extinct animal is defying popu
lar prejudice by tearing into tatters the stars and stripes,'
for that purpose using his tusks and trunk. In the mid
dle distance is the temple of Justice, falling into ruin.
Its column s>ypibfrtico, pediment, cornice, facade and all of
its architectural vitals are out of order. In the left dis
tance is another temple standing behind three lombardy
poplars, that is too far gone to be identified. It is a pic
ture of melancholy decay, and evidently is beyond re
pair, fit only for the lion and the lizard.
In the right foreground is a pair of old boots. They
are of the kind seen on the feet of old gentlemen who in
their heyday drank too much sherry and got phylloxera
knots on their toes, requiring that the leather be cut-in
slits. These boots . are labeled on a tag tied" to one of
the straps, "A. Lincoln."/ Beneath this stirring histori
cal effort is the legend: "The nation needs for leader a
man of mammoth size, to combat the trust mammoth.
The man that filled this pair of boots, or one like him,
would be able to handle the trust Colossus."
Such a man is in the race, and Is trying for the place;
Uncle Sammy is a friend of his, I know. \
And the syndicates are curst if William Randolph Hearst
Should be the man to run this little, show.
IT is to be regretted that Mr. Hearst does not>ehliven
his-^jalifornia campaign and put his best and most
impressive machinery in motion here, as he doeskin
the East. His headquarters in this city are redolent of
the incense of nicotine, and the N genial, influence of
gently warming beverages is hot unknown there. But
otherwise his campaign is pushe'd more by aggression
than persuasion, and there is abroad a suspicion that his
manager is a sort of Tarpeyan rock from which traitors
are tb be thrown and frightfully mussed, rather than a
grotto of greeting and of promise. / .
Now, in the East his progress toward the White
House is enlivened by pictorial illumination and the
sweet graces of song. Before ttfe primaries in Brooklyn,
the balmy spring evening was spiced by the efforts of a
singer, borrowed from a vaudeville show, who made the
welkin ring and wrung/ applause from our countrymen by
this effort:
Uncle Sammy needs a man on the bold and fearless plan
Who is not afraid of trust or syndicate, .
Who will prove himself a friend to all union labor men,
Who to help the weak will never hesitate.
"Well, never mind," suggested the
man, patting the youngster assuringly
on the head, "you'll soon be in bed
and fast asleep." ;
Â¦ "No, I won't," replied the boy, at the
same time shooting an inquisitive
glance in the direction of his mother.
"You won't?" queried the man, "and
why not?"
"Well, papa and mamma had a row
coming to the city, and when they get
upstairs they will have a big jaw and
brother and me won't get a chance to
sleep."
The startling . explanation of the
youngster was distinctly heard by the
entire assembly, and both father and
mother showed signs of embarrass
ment that did. not escape the crowd,
which had suddenlv become interested
in the parents of the little fellow.
I Ten minutes later a bellboy, passing
along the corridor on the fourth floor,
was attracted by a strange sound
that resembled that attending the
beating of a carpet, and accompanying
it was the childish cry of "Oh, papa,
I won't do it againâ sure, papa, I'll be
a good boy," and then a sterner voice
said: "Now, you brat, get into that
bed as fast as you can." And silence
ensued.
"You're pretty tired, ain't you?" re
marked the gentleman, as he noticed
the " boy's wearied . expression.
"Y-e-s s-i-r," replied the boy, with
a yawn- .
They arrived at the Palace Hotel
6n the late train from the south
father, mother and two youngsters, the
smaller of the two being, about 5 years
of age. The little fellow's drooping
eyelids told plainly- of his tired feel
ing after a sultry and monotonous trip
up through the valley. While the
father hurried to the register to in
scribe his name and secure his apart
ments, the mother, her face bearing
a serious expression that might have
been attributed to fatigue, threw her-
Belf into a big chair and stared sol
emnly at the hotel clock, which point
ed the hour of midnight. The little
fellow, somewhat awed by his magnifi
cent surroundings, quietly wandered
into the crowd of travelers who were
waiting th-ir turn at the desk, and
was soon engaged In conversation with
one of the hotel's prospective guests.

MEN AND MATTERS IN

MOVES
TALK OF THE TOWN
AND TOPICS OF THE
TIMESTRENTON. N. J., April 19. â Vice
li'hancellor Pitney to-day appointed
Vharles C. Slack of Jersey City re
ceiver of the Globe Securities Com
pany of New York. The company dealt
in bonds and securities. Henry L.
the complainant, places the
company's liabilities at $96 8,800 and
nsets at $512,000.
Appo: .:s Black Receiver.
Yesterday in the land i.aud hearing
was devoted to completing ttie exam
ination of Defendant Henry P. Di
mond and the beginning of the cross
examination. Many letters that passed
between the witness and his co
defendants and former clients, Fred
A. Hyde and John A. Benson, were
added to those introduced In evidence
on Mondav, but they merely confirmed
the points already made as to Hyde,
and proved nothing as to Benson. Di
mond's attorney, Charles S. Wheeler,
had him repeat in every possible form
his declarations that he had no part
or knowledge in the alleged conspir
acy, and then turned him over to the
later date. His explanation was that
when he left Hyde's office his rubber
name stamp was left behind, and that
this had been used by the office boy in
putting his name on the letters in ques
tion. This had been the practice in the
office for his routine letters to the* land
office while he was still acting as Hyde's
attorney, and it had been kept up after
ward, the office boy having used "Di
mond's name stamp for all the letters
on a list given him by Hyde.
BENSON'S BATHROOM.
Two letters only from the Benson-
Dimond correspondence relating to the
SanFranclsco mountains reserve were
introduced, and then- Heney admitted
that the Government did not contend
that this transaction was criminal.
Having offered the Government the
use of the whole mass of Benson let
ters Wheeler therefore dropped this line
after straightening out the bathroom
incident. Dimond told how* he had
called on Benson at the WHlard Hotel
in Washington on the occasion of the
latter's visit In May, 1902. - The Ari
zona business was the only matter dis
cussed, and after luncheon they had
gone upstairs to Benson's room to look
for a draft of a contract the "scripper"
expected to close with the Seligmans In
New York. While Benson was search-
Ing through his bag for the paper a
light knock was heard on the door.
Benson apologized and asked the wit
ness to step Into the bathroom for an
Instant. This done the door was
closed for a minute or vo and then
opened again. Then Benson had got
rid of Dlmond by promising to bring
the contract " down to Dlmond's office.
The witness had not seen Woodford D.
Harlan, of the* General Land Office, in
the. room or ever met him elsewhere
while in Washington.
"Who did you think It was that
knocked at Benson's door ?"> asked
Whe"eler.
''A woman," Dimond answered, while
the spectators, including Benson him
self, laughed.
On cross-examination Heney took the
witness back to, his first consultation
with an attorney after he learned of
his indictment. He had gone at once,
he said, to his friend Wheeler, who
agreed to appear for hlm.^ At Wheel
er's request he had gone to Hyde's of
fice for the docket of selections with
which Hyde had furnished: him when
he went to Washington. Only ten' or
fifteen minutes had been spent there,
but Hyde had expressed his surprise
at Dlmond's Indictment, saying, ".They
might just as well have Indicted my.
clerks as you."
. "Were you not in Hyde's office for
an hour and ; ten minutes?": Heney
queried.^
"No. We were not on good terms and
I got away as quickly as possible."
WHY DIMOND LEFT HYDE.
"You. had ( a , misunderstanding vwith
him regarding your pay, did 'Â¦ you not *.'-.
"Yes," but that, was not the, reason
for rriy leaving â¢ his office, j. Before' I left
Washington - In' February, 1903, . I had
arranged with Â¦ Britton . & ; Gray to rep
resent them here, and I- told ; Hyde
that I could no -longer, act for him," nor
would Britton & Gray, unless he should
carry out our suggestions. : I also told
him; that I ; should v askj $500 L :a month If
I -'acted -further as his attorney." ,

him no ; longer." : , " ) :''-Â¦Â¦ Z^'. : ;;.;?;^A^ 'Â¦Â¦

made It necessary to explain the large'
number of letters from him"; in 'posses
sion of, the. land office relating; to, the
Hyde-Benson selections ami bearing a
Wheeler then put in a letter from
Jeremiah Collins, the Washington land
agent, and Dlmond's reply to the
same, both dated in March, 1903, after
Dimond had ceased to act as Hyde's
attorney. Collins wrote complaining
that Hyde, had failed to do anything
to meet the charges of the land of
fice or to clear up the clouded titles
to the lands he had sold as bases for
lieu selections. Dimond answered that
he had tried in vain to get his for
mer client to do more than had been
done; that Hyde declared Elizabeth
Dlmond. in whose name many of the
base lands stood, was not a fictitious
person, but a servant in the Morris
home at Oakland, and that the writer
himself believed that JoostH. Schnei
der, on whose statement the Interior
Department 4 was supposed to have act
ed In suspending the Hyde-Benson se
lections, could not be trusted, as he
was apparently after money. Dimond
also said that if Hyde would persist
Id tils search he would probably be
able to find 90 per cent of the persons
who had located his school, lands and
get affidavits from them that would
be of great assistance In clearing up
the tangle caused by the , suspension
order. Â¦
Then came a letter the witness had
written to BHiton & Gray, Hyde's for
mer attorneys at Washington, relating
to t% efforts to get Hyde to . perfect
his titles. Dimond wrote that Hyde
had refused to accept these sugges
tions, in which all â¢ the lawyers had
united,' adding: "His reply was that
he was going to handle the matter to
suit himself, and he intimated that he
wanted no suggestions from any one as
to" what course he should pursue."..
On the opening of court Wheeler told
Commissioner Heacock that a por
tion of the Hyde-Dimond correspond
ence In his poshsesÂ«lon had been en
trusted to him by Hyde, and that for
this reason he had not felt at liberty
to comply with an order from the Com
missioner which Heney had brought
him on Monday evening. This order
directed that Heney be permitted to
inspect all the Hyde-Dimond letters
in Wheeler's hands; but for the rea
son stated, Dimond's attorney said,
he would not show letters received
from Hyde unless the Commissioner
should specially order it.
"We contend that the Commissioner
had n'o right to make such an order
at all, and we want the letters return
ed to us," said " Bert Schlesinger of
Hyde's counsel, and Garret W. ( Mc-
Enerney, representing the same cli
ent, added that Hyde was negligerit
in permitting the letters to leave his
hands.
"I shall ask your Honor," Heney
said, "to make an order now directing
Mr. Wheeler to retain possession of
these letters. The Government can
not compel Hyde to testify against
himself, and therefore we are en
titled to such an order at this time."
The order was granted*v

went, Heney did not succeed in shak

particular.

examination, applying to his 'client
Hyde, but the Commissioner sustained
Heney's argument that McEnerney had
opened the door for it by failing to
object to Wheeler's general examina
tion of the witness. Then Dlmond re
peated the'story of his visit at Hyde's
request to Tucson and his interview
with J. H. Schneider after the latter
had given the Government a statement
charging his former employer with
fraud in j using fictitious names in the
manufacture of land titles. Dlmond
added nothing new to his testimony of
Monday, and refused to admit that
Schneider had told him of any other
illegal transactions in Hyde's office. ;
The examination will continue at 10:30*
o'clock -this morning.

Thus far wireless telegraphy has not
figured in International affairs and, no
conventions covering its use have been
considered. It is believed that, sooner
or later, the subject will be taken up
by diplomatists with a view to report
ing an international agreement upon it.
The discussion to-day was tentative in
a measure and no definite decision -was
reached. It Is likely, however, that in
the near future some action will be
taken that will provide "for a proper
Government supervision of the wire
less system of telegraphy.
WASHINGTON, April 19.â The most
important matter considered at the
Cabinet meeting to-day Vaa that look
ing to the control * by the Gov
ernment of wireless telegraphy. The
subject was broached by Secretary
Hay iriV connection * with the com
munication received recently by this
Government from Russia. The dis
cussion finally drifted to the ex
pression of the opinion that it would
be desirable, If not, indeed, absolutely
necessary for this Government to con
trol, at least in a supervisory way, the
operation of wireless telegraphy, par
ticularly along the coast. Stations for
the receipt, of wireless messages are
springing ui>_ at] various places along
both the Atlantic and Pacific coasts.
It was pointed out that, in the event
of a war with a foreign nation, it
might be necessary in defense of the
nation for officers of the United States
to have charge of these stations, as a
means, of assurance to the Government
that no communication was* established,
with vessels of an enemy's fleet and
that the system was' not employed to
the detriment of United States inter

* 1st. This food is toothsome and delicious.
2nd. It is wonderfully easy of digestion, the starchy part having been
predigested in the process of manufacture.
3rd. Predigested Grape-Nuts supplies body with the carbo-hydrates in
such form that the blood quickly assimilates and deposits these elements
in the tissues all over the body, there to lie dormant until exertion releases
the kinetic energy.
â¢ That energy iÂ£ there "tf Grape Nuts has been the food.
4tb. This food contains delicate particles of Phosphate of Potash ob-
tained in natural form from field Brains.
This dement, thus highly trituated by Mother Nature, has an affinity
for and will unite with albumen and water in the human bodv.
This combination produces the soft gray matter, filling the Brain and
Nerve Cells all over the body. That keeps the

In front of the Memorial building' yes
terday at noon; and one sophomore
boy received a broken collar bone. The
fight was over the caps which the
freshman girls wore In defiance of the
sophomore h edict. .The fracas lasted
several minutes, and caused lots of
excitement among the outside stu
dents. At first three of the " '07" girls
downed one of the fair Amazons of
" '06," and when three sophomore girls
sprang to her aid. the tussle waxed
fierce. Scratching, j hair pulling and
even biting were J resorted to, and at
the closeof the' scuffle the lawn re
sembled a woman's; dressing-room.
â¢ War between the boys of the two
classes has been raging all day for
the same cause. At 9:30 o'clock in
the morning, when the sophomores
were in class, the, freshmen arrayed
themselves in the long looked for caps.
They then marched down with their
blue headgear fronted by a large
" '0",". and taunted- the. sophomores by
walking in front of the windows. When
the class w'as out the sophomores held
a hasty meeting, and from then on
there were lively times at Whitman.
The freshmen, although : they out
number the sophomores, two to one,
have kept well bunched alh day, hard;
ly darins to venture across the . cam
pus in less than knots of four, or five.
Once in a while- a forgetful " '07"
would stray from the /protection of his
comrades, and them he would r be
pounced upon by several sophomores
and - a sharp tussle . would ensue. A
fierce' fight . between the 'two . classes
took place just before > noon, j in .which
Heber Ryan of the sophomore, class
got a collar bone broken and : shoulder
dislocated. Several - of \his . classmates

day from White Horse. One of the re
cent phenomenally -. rich strikes was
made on No.. 45, below Discovery, on
Bullion Creek. A pay streak : . was
struck on bedrock, and it is three feet
deep. Those working the claim have
drifted in a crosscut, for twenty-seven
feet and are -still in the pay streak.
Its width is not yet known, but it myst
exceed thirty feet at least.
This great, body, of pay gravel,
through its entire, depth of three feet
and full width of twenty-seven feet,
is running from 20 to 80 cents per pan.
Similar rich results have been obtain
ed on every Bullion Creek claim where
bedrock has been reached. Bedrock on
Kirnberly and Fourth of July creeks is
proving rich, . though producing v less
gold than that of Bullion. Every town
in the Upper Yukon Valley Is repre

night that bookmaking would prob
ably be stopped at the track. "There
Is no reason to believe that we will
permit gambling at Washington Park,"
said the Assistant Chief, "when we
have stopped it elsewhere."
No Betting at Washington Park.
It was decided to have the degree of
past grand protector conferred on sev
eral members of local lodges In recog
nition of services rendered the order.
To-day there will be the election of
srand officers and it is likely that all
committees will report and that the
business will close with the afternoon
cession. *
In his report the grand protector re
views,, the work of the order dur
ing the year, and this is to th^ effect
that while the order has not made any
astounding gain during that time it
has, all things considered, made an
Increase in membership and a credit
able showing. He expresses regret that
the order In this State is denied finan
cial assistance by the supreme body
of the order to enable It to carry on
a campaign of propagation in line with
other organizations. With the means
*i Its command the order, by Judicious
management, had succeeded in adding
to the membership. He recommended
tjiat a law be enacted that only those
members that attend subordinate lodge
meetings be eligible to membership in
the Grand Lodge; that there be bien
nial instead of annual sessions, and
that the committee on the state of the
order be abolished.
Grand Secretary Quitzow in his re
pert* shows that the order in the
"United States,* which had a member
ship of only 49.S76 on the first of Janu
ary. WOI. had on the first of January of
this year Increased to 72,741. He con
gratulates Mrs. Dorrls Kaplan, Mrs.
Luton, Mrs. Phebe Dunzweiler and
State Organizer Emma Qultzow for
their energetic work in securing mem
ber* for the order during the year.
He reported the death since the pre
vious session of four of the oldest mem
bers of the Grand Lodgeâ H. K. Cum
mings. Dr. A- H. Cook, E. F. Aiken and
Abner Phelps.
Supreme Representative James P.*
Dockery presented his report of the
work of the supreme body at Its last
session and called attention to the fact
that the supreme body has decided to
erect a headquarters in Indianapolis
lo cost $60,000.
U. C. Traphagen. T. H. Berkey and
Phebe J. Dunzweiler were appointed a
committee on distribution, and to this
committee was referred the printed
documents. It was also decided that
this committee should take charge of
all documents. presented during the ses
sion.
J. A- Calquhon was appointed journal
clerk to assist Grand Secretary Qult
zow.
After the lodge had been formally
opened the Grand Lodge degree was
conferred on such as were entitled to

It seems the hen which lays the rold
Â«Â»n e^gs for the promoters, of the
amateur fistic game has met an un
timely death. Last night at the Me
chanics* Pavilion annex the crowd on
hand to witness the bouts promoted by
the Lincoln Club would have put to
ehame the attendance at a sandlot ball
game. Just what is responsible for
this sudden change is not clearly set
forth, but in all probability the prize
fighters' union has played a leading
part in the latest catastrophe of ring
dom.
To add to the frost and discomfort of
a small house and less enthusiasni, the
bouts were very bad. In fact there was
only one good fight on the card and
even that ended without the formality
of a knockout. The youths in the
bleachers raised their gentle voices
often and strongly to reprove the man
agers of the club and incidentally to
Jeer and make fun of the contestants.
Without these youngsters the other
spectators would have left the place
rre two fights had been decided.
AJ. Elkins. the hustling youngster
from the California Cycling Club, was
vanquished by his old rival, Abe Label,
after four hurricane rounds. Both boys
forgot science and resorted to slugging.
Elkins rushed his man from tbe start
and looked like the winner, but every
time he came In Label met him square
ly with a straight left and In the last
round put him down and almost out.
Charles Augustus won from Joe Po
desta in a bout full of all kinds of
fighting. The men were billed for. the
main event, but it was a shabby sort
of affair. The rest of the card was an
exceedingly poor one. The fights be
tween James St. Claire and Frank
Smith and Byron Meade and Jack
JDoyle were stopped by the referee. St.
Clair and Doyle being declared win
ners. Jack Bradshaw got the decision
over Frank "Wells and Kid Lloyd out
pointed Jack Gamersol.

Willie See piloted two winners.
The stables of Dayton & Co., Car
lisle & Co.. and R. H. Clark were
shipped to Worth yesterday. *
Pierce J ran in the colors of his for
mer owner, Harry Stover, again yes
terday.
The race for gentlemen riders, to be
decided on Saturday, Fablola day, is
attracting much attention.
ENTRIES FOR TO-DAY.
If George Berry can run over a slow
track he did not emphasize the fact in
the concluding mile and fifty yard
selling event. The three-year-old ruled
favorite throughout the betting, and
at no stage of the running displayed
any speed. Dugan tried to make a
runaway race of it with Hainault, but
made too much early use' of his mount
and was nipped out a neck at the wire
by Jo Lewis on Heather Honey.
Knapp finished third with Laocoon,
the second choice. -The winner was
quoted at 12 and 15 to 1.
NOTES OF THE TRACK.
McBride, j on Optimo, post favorite
for the six and a half furlong number,
had a most invigorating ride, but that
didn't get much for the gelding's back
ers. Early in the game McBride man
aged to get cut off and after following
a tortuous course, did manage to finish
third. At the start See, on Pierce J,
backed from 7 down to 5, Ikimmed
away to the front and stayed there,
leading Rollick out four lengths. Alice
Carey ran a poor race.
POSSART/S CLEVER VICTORY.
See continued the good work by
taking the mile and seventy yard sell
ing affair on Possart, a 3 to 2 favorite.
It was no hollow victory, though, for
Sheehan, astride Boutonniere, affer
making all the pace, was only beaten
by a neck at the finish. Canj;jo, at 17
to 1, ran into the. show, six lengths in
advance of Idogo. Both Mocorite and
Billy Moore ran as if in need of a va
cation.
The muddy condition of the track
and with 113 pounds up it was
thought might bother the Ormonde
horse, for 4 which reason Don Domo
had a slight call on him.. Double Six
did not take to the going at all, but
between the other four starters, Beau
Ormonde, Celebrant, Hagerdon and
the "Texas streak," it was a pretty
race to the head of the stretch. Don
Domo cracked first and Beau Or
monde, gradually drawing away, won
easily from Celebrant. Hagerdon' took
show honors without an effort. .
HEATHER HONEY A SURPRISE.
The excellence of the card attracted
a liberal attendance and the sport was
above the average. Favorites were re
turned first on three occasions.
Heather Honey, a 15 to 1 shot, furnish
ed the surprise. \
Money Muss, now owned by the
Denver horseman, Ed Gaylord, made
short work of his company in the in
troductory five and a half furlong
sprint. Glendenning and several others
were scratched, which left the "yaller"
horse to go to the post a 2 to 5 chance.
He was ridden by Dugan and won in
a common canter. Headwater, whose
price went to 60 to 1, took the place
from Dora I by a length. Olympian
received wretched handling.
Cardinal Sarto- another decided fa

Despondency caused M>s. Lottie
Chase, a' waitress employed at the
Presidio, to attempt her life last- night
by the inhalation of illuminating gas
in her room at 2747 Greenwich street.
Owing to her absence at the supper
hour inquiries were made at,,, the
house, where she resided, with the re
sult that the woman was found -in an
unconsc'ioHis condition in her apart
ment, and an open gas key .testified to
the cause. The ambulance waa called
and Mrs. Chase removed to the Emer
gency Hospital. The ride,.- combined
with the fresh air, revived^her before
reaching the hospital, and -her condi
tion is not_ serious. She admitted
turning on the gas with suicidal intent
and assigns as a reason the fact that
her husband, Albert Chase; a soldier,
deserted her. Mrs. Chase:is a.strik
ing brunette q( about 23 years of age.

appointment. Utility is the keynote in
her construction and arrangement.
She was purchased, when almost com

1300 steerage passengers. She is able
to carry 15,000 tons dead weight of

' Fifty feet longer than the Korea or
Siberia, with a net tonnage three times
preaiPr than that of the Gaelic, which
lies tinder the Mongolia's shadow, al
though on the other side of the wharf,
this hujre product of American ship
building was yesterday and will be un
til she- takes her departure the star at
traction along the water front.
The Mongolia is scheduled to leave
here May 7 on her. first trip to the
Orient, but it is doubtful whether she
will be reudy. AVhile at Pernambuco
Bhe ran ashore and during the two
hours she struggled to free herself
from thfi clutches of the sand, she is
thought t<> have sustained injury which
will take unme time to repair.- She left
Norfolk; Va., in a more or less unfin
ished condition and apart from the
tiamapr sustained at Pernambuco,

before she is in condition to receive
I>assrni?erp.
The steamship Mongolia, Captain
Kinder, latest addition to the Pacific
Mail Company's trans-Pacific fleet and
one of the largest vessels built in the
United Suites, made her first appear
ance in this port early yesterday morn
ing. After passing quarantine Inspec
t.on Khe proceeded to the wharf at First
and Brannan streets and there she
now liÂ«>s. towerins over the dockshed
and giving that structure an appear
ance of insignificance which speaks vol
umes ff>r the bulk of the new liner.
The Mongolia shipped a crew of 192
Chinese at Salina Cruz. One of them
died of heart disease yesterday morn-
Ing. .The Chinese were landed at An
gel Island, where they will be held in
quarantine for several days.
Until the new wharves are built the
Mongolia will be something of an ele
phant on the hands of her owners. Her
main deck overtops the roof of the
Mall dock ehed, and the work of load
ing the big vessel will be difficult and
costly. Until adequate wharf facili
ties are provided much of the Mon
golia's freight will have to be handled
from lighters. "Ipj
The trouble, says Chief Officer Hitch
field, was not with the food/ but with
the cook, who was innocent of the
most primitive culinary knowledge,
and had been shipped under false col
ors, but who fared no better than his
victims, as he had to eat the products
of his own cooking.
The sailors and firemen make bitter
complaint of the food served them on
the Mongolia, and for once the after
guard admits the Justice of the fore
castle complaint. Each sailor and fire
man had a Btory to tell of unsatisfied
appetite. Shortly after leaving Kor
fojk the men demanded to be placed on
the ration provided for under the
United States shipping laws. This was
done, but brought no peace to the
Mongolia's forecastle, for the reason
that the food was served practically
uncooked.
The Mongolia left Norfolk, Va., Feb
ruary 23 and made an average speed
of 12 knots. She burned 4500 tons of
coal during the passage.

floor plates to skylights is 70 feet. The
engines are four-cylinder, quadruple
expansion of the usual marine type,
with Stephenson link valve motion.
The Mongolia is equipped with
pumps, condensers, evaporators, elec
tric lighting and refrigerating plants
of the latest design, and on the upper
deck, abreast of the engine-room on the
port side, is a very completely equipped
machine i?hop.
The principal dimensions of the Mon

Peape and quiet reigned supreme
yesterday in the Twenty-eighth Infan
try cantonment. Lieutenant Colonel
W. L, Pitcher has released the officers
that had been under arrest and they,
have gone back to their respective du
ties. V
In speaking of the recent commotion
in the camp Colonel Pitcher said: "I
am an officer of the Government and
1 am not here to make any grand
stand play. I do my work and I in
tend that all under my command shall
do what is expected of them. I have
a large-sized club in use for those who
do not conform to army regulations.
That is all I have to say about it.
I am working for the Government and
those under me must conform to army
routine work. That is all there is
about It. The officers under arest I
have released, but unless they toe the
mark they know what the conse
quences will be." ?
Lieutenants Aiken and Foote, who
have been under arrest and who were
released yesterday, had little to say.
Lieutenant Foote was" non-commital,
and when asked regarding his arrest
and confinement in the. post stated that
he had nothing to say.
Lieutenant Aiken greatly regretted
that his name had been again drag
ged before the public. He said that
he had always tried to conform to and
do justice to the views of his superior
officers. He was always willing to be
counseled and advised by his com
manders. Regarding the affair in the
Philippines he said that the report that
in the court martial there he had lost
several files was an error. He had
simply been reprimanded.

PICTURE FOR FUTURE REFERENCE.
-COSTLY TOYS"
IS THE TITLE OF THE
...ART SUPPLEMENT...
By Charles Van den Eycken
TO BE GIVEN WITH THE
NEXT SUNDAY CALL
The proverbial playfulness of kittens is a favorite subject with painters who
choose their models from the domesticated branch of the feline tribe. The fact, that
the little animals have not been endowed with discretion in their choice of playthings,
along with their Instinct for play often leads them- to do much "mischief, and it is.
this mischief which furnishes an inexhaustible fund of material upon which such art-
ists as Eugene Lambert, Mme. llcnriette Ronncr and Charles Van den Eycken, the
painter of the original of this art supplement, have drawn In producing the plcturesV
which are their life work.
Other artists of more serious temperament have used cats as models for repre-
â¢ sentations of the savage members of the same family. The anatomy of the domestic
* jr cat is almost identical with that of many, of its wild cousins, and the fact that the sav-
- â¢' age instincts of its ancestors have only a thin veneer of the domestication makes it
a simple matter for an artist to transform the household tabby- into a v tiger or lion-
ess, as Delacroix frequently did. One needs only to observe a cat drinking, eating
t or stalking a mouse or sparrow to note the resemblance recalled by Whittier, who
displayed much of a painter's instinct in his description in the lines in "Snow Bound". _/
' "The cat's dark silhouette' on the wall, a couchant tiger's seemed to fall.".
In such pictures as the one which is the subject of this notice there are the ele-
ments of lively action and a pleasing suggestion of innocence and Joyousness which
make them justly popular. â¢ In Van den Eycken's painting there is also bright and
agreeable color and skillful brush work. . .
Â¦ Charles Van den Eycken is a Belgian of pure Flemish descent. He Is still a
young man and has every prospect of becoming even more famous in his chosen
branch of art than the celebrated Mme. Ronner, whose pupil he is. - His studio ia hi .0*'
Antwerp in the same building as that of 'his former Instructor., During the last dec-
ade his works have become well known hi America and the sale of his pictures in this
country is steadily increasing. V

. The crime for which Lee Ung Ock will
die was committed In Siskiyou County
on the 9th of June. 1902, when he mur
dered Wing Ga. He was tried and con
victed and afterward applied for a new
trial, but it was denied him. Judgment
was pronounced on November 7, 190'-.
and he was sentenced to be hanged
January 30. 1903. His case was ap
pealed to the Supreme Court, and on
December 12, 1903, that court affirmed
the judgment of the lower court, and on
the 29th of January of this year he was
resentenced to be hanged. on April 22,
1904.
ii SAN QUENTIN, ' April 19iâ Lee'Ung
Ock, the Chinese who has been con
demned to death and is awaiting exe
cution, has twice attempted suicide
wrth a steel pen. Both attempts have
been made since his incarceration in
the death chamber, and In Â¦ one in
stance he came near succeeding. To
day the condemned man was taken
from the death chamber and domiciled
in the hospital.
Lee Ung Ock has been acting pecu
liarly for some time. He was sen
tenced to be hanged next Friday, and
he was taken to the death chamber last
week and two guards assigned as
death watch. He was searched upon
entering the chamber, but no weapons
were d^covered, and since being, there
he has had no possible chance of se
curing any.
The condemned men are allowed to
write letters, and when Lee Ung asked
for an American pen he was given one.
While .the guards were not watching
he flattened the pen point out and
jabbed several holes in vital portions of
his anatomy. He was discovered, how
ever, before he succeeded in killing
himself. The prison surgeon sewed up
the lacerations and he was once again
put under surveillance. Despite the
closeness of the watch he succeeded in
cutting himself a second time, in the
same manner. "Warden Tompkins was
notified and, believing that the Mongo
lian was insane, wired for the Lunacy
Commission to examine him. To-day
Drs. Hatch and Clark arrived and
made an examination. Governor Par
dee was then telegraphed to by Dr.
Hatch and asked to grant a repriave
until a further examination could be
made. Dr. Clark stated to-day that
Lee Ung Ock was a very sick man, but
whether he was insane he could not
definitely decide upon first examina
tion.

ued steadily throughout the night, the

NEW YORK. April 19â The belief that ac
tivity awaited on the decision of the Harrl
man petition to enjoin the Northern Securities
plan of distribution proved true to-day when
the petition was refused, but it did not appear
that the decision itcelf was the cause of the
increased pressure to sell stocks which devel
oped ar.d which caused a sharp reaction in
the whole market. The first effect of the
decision was to halt the advance In prices
which was then in progress, but the highest
â¢prices or the day were touched afterward, and
when the decline was renewed a period of dull
ness Intervened which was more marked than
at any time, during the recent dull period.
Tho decline centered In United States Steel
preferred and was unexplained by any news
before the market closed. Authoritative in
timation* were given that the contÂ»-et against
the Northern Securltle* distribution will lÂ»e
continued in other courts, thus depriving the
market of the assurance that '-jhl* disturbing
factor is removed by the deci*ifin at St. Paul.
The tone of the decision was interpreted a* an
cxpresxion of opinion against the plausibility
and strength of the Union Pacific contention.
This opinion was of disadvantage to . Union
1'aciflc and caused celling by speculative hold
ers who hav^ counted oifÂ» the value to Union
Pacific of the projected control of Northern
Pacific and Rurlinrton. Northern Securities
on the curb advanced 1 St on the decision, but
lost it all in the subsequent reaction. The.
market closed heavy at the rally. Many mll
lion* were loaned on call at \\i per cent, and
interest rate* receded for all nalcs of lours.
Another large remittance of Japanese gold
from San Francisco wus followed by a further
sharp advance In sterling exchange bills. It
iÂ« ruppoKMl that much of the Japanese gold
Is 5-hipprd to Han Francisco for the express
purpose of remittance to London In payment
of obligations for war material there. ThÂ«
rrlvilegÂ»s of telegraphic transfer from San
Franc:iKco to New York accorded by the Gov
ernment save* time and expense In this man
no of transmission.

The feature of the market at present is the
weakness in Prunes, which have recently de
clined, materially both here and In the East.
Holders are letting go at concessions from even
the low quotations, and the situation is very
unsatisfactory. Ralrins are still unsettled and
the packers have lately shown signs of selling
at a decline from the established quotations to
get back .their money, but there was a report
yesterday that the fractional difficulties which
have demoralized Â¦ the market for. some time

iii .the face of the declining tendency of
wheat, the corn market exhtbittd consider
able rirnmesB during the early part of the
Bfsslon. due largely to small receipts. Buying
by commission houws caused a moderate ad
vance in July and the. gain was well main
tained until near the middle of* the day when
a leading long ' brgan to Fell large -quantities
of May. Under these, offerings the markÂ»-t
broke severely.- the May delivery declining
about 2%c, nr.d July over lc.
Weather was favorable for farm jwork and
there was talk of freer acceptances of corn
by the West, especially Nebraska. One- reason
assigned for lh<? slump was that in order to
prevent the stlling of. any of these acceptances,
which are likely to rriule well, the big bull
decided to break the price of the May option.
The market closed weak and near the low
[â¢rice. July opened unchanged â¢ to- 14c higher
at 50 1* 650 4c and cloced at.49U649%c. May

CHICAGO, April 19. â May corn had a savage
break, of 2U on 'chance to-day, with Armour
an open seller. STfta goneral ; ' impression . was
that the biÂ»v line held by that house has"
been quietly liquidated during the - laut two
weeks and that the deal la practically * over.
Tlie Armour selling to-day began shortly be
tore noon and for an hour thÂ« pit was In a
turmoil, anxious longs dumping 'their lines,
liglitins to get riii or th.e/r. corn before the
bottom went out of the Â¦ market. â¢ One repre
sentative of the Armour Cofcipuny sold per
sonally fully <iiH),<MH) bushels of May and made
no eJloit either at "concealment- or support
when the break tot under way. The. Armour
line originally was generally, estimated as
high aa 15.0Ou.000 bushels and It was'accum
ulated mostly between 47c. and' 53e. .'Â»â¢ The
closing iirii-e to-day lor May was 4U%i. Just
2',ic under the tinal figures ot yeKterday.
Unanimity of reiiorts trqra. Northwest and
Southwest, that the weather ..Is excellent
brought out liberal sales of long wheat here
to-day. As a result July wheat: at the '-close
showed a loss of mi even cent. July corn Is
down %Â©%c. Oats are Â«ff %c and provisions
2',ic to 7 1 /'*-'. â¢ Â¦ Â¦ ' 'â¢ Â¦â¢
llain in Kansas, with an official forecast of
more to follow, caused bearish sentiment
among wheat traders at the opening. In spite
of firm cables, the market here was barely
Bteady, Initial sales of July being unchanged
at 8Â«%c. News from the. Northwest also was
discouraging to the bulls, the Weather there
bcln; reported aa greatly improved and that
a cood acreage is now almost assured. Long
wheat was offered freely from the beginning,
but the majority of traders were timid about
buying, notwithstanding the fact that the
numerous crop damase reports are still being
received from Indiana, Illinois, Missouri and
Kansas. The lack of demand soon started
prices downward, and for the remainder of
the session a decidedly weak tone was mani
fest. The market lacked any support. Busi
ness from out of town was chiefly in the na
ture of selling orders from the Northwest and
Southwest. A decrease of (117,000 bushels in
the world's visible supply, as shown by the
Bradstreefs â a much smaller amount than
had been anticipated â contributed weakness to
the general situation. After July had I de
clined to S5%c. there was little ostensible
support. A ylicht rally resulted, but the mar
ket closed weak with July at Â«5*4'c. May

Receipts of Strawberries consisted of eight
chests of Longworths from Palo Alto and about
twenty-two chests of the larger varieties
from Watsonvllle. The receipts included some
very poor lots, which were hard to dispose of
even at the minimum quotations, while choice
offerings met with prompt sale at full figures.
Trade in the Orange market was of a light
Jobbing character, as local buyers were dis
couraged by ; the Inclement weather and were
taking no more than absolutely necessary to
supply their regular trade. Prices were un
changed, and poor quality fruit, which consti
tuted the bulk of the supplies, was being offer
ed freely at liberal concessions. Tangerines
were offering again and â¢ sold at 76c@$l- per
small â¢ box. Lemons and Limes were quoted
steady at previous prices. The market was
practically bare of Bananas during the early
trade, but the steamer Alameda arrived from
Honolulu late In the day* with 4150 bunches,
nearly all of which were too giyen for Imme

The feeling In ranch Eggs remained as be
fore slated. Some receivers were disposed to
get an advance, but the majority of the large
handlers quoted the market precisely as before.
Receipts . were about 250 cases larger than on
the preceding day, but the general tone of the

In front of the" premises of the Dow
Pump Works at 'Fremont and Howard

successful. Lynch has very influen

on the application for a: writ, .contin
ued the matter for further hearing; till

to appear for arraignment to-morrow.
â¢A case of too much Peterson devel
open in Judge 'Cook's' court' yesterday
when an ' argument, on an application
for a writ of habeas corpus for the
release of Alphonse Peterson from cus
tody came; up. Through a blunder; of
the Sheriff/ Alphonise has been substi
tuted for Henry â¢Peterson, /and Al

be discharged from custody.
\ Henry; was held \ to answer by; Police

the cases; were assigned to Judge
Cook's court." Alphonse -was held . to
answer J by Judge Conlan on 1 Marclr 24
on three charges of, grand larceny,; but
the casesJhavelnotVyet been' assigned.
It has developed that when r Henry
should have been taken to court for
arraignment'. Alphonse was taken by
mistake! .After being .arraigned % and
aske'd- his : true name he -answered,' "Al

not heard of Alphonse's case, -he
thought Henry's true name was . Al

ords as "Alphonse â¢ Peterson, alias
Henry Peterson." ' . .
"Henry was entirely overlooked in_ the

Under the law the taxes due will
bear interest at the rate of 7 per cent
per annum for ascertain period until
paid to the State. The interest on the
sum involved will amount to $24 72 per
day. dating from February 14. 1904.
The commissions for collecting the
tax to which the City Treasurer is en
titled under the State* law will aggre
gate approximately $1275. A case is
now pending in the courts to determine
if the City Treasurer can receive the
commissions under the charter provis
ion which, prohibits any city official
from accepting fees outside of his regu
lar salary. Pending the decision all
such fees are being held in the city's
vaults.
The attorneys agreed to pay to the
City Treasurer the amount due from
the estate as Inheritance taxes, al
hough some doubts exist as to the le
gality of compelling inheriting sisters
5,p pay the taxes, in this caBe Mrs. Her
mann Oelrichs and Mrs. Virginia Van
derbilt.
The inventory and appraisement of the
estate was fixed at $3,040,187 35, but this
was reduced , by the sum of $497,846 S3,
of which $215,065 45 is for claims paid
on the estate; $150,000 for attorneys'
fees; $45,108 66 for commissions of ad
ministrator; $64,155 63 receipts of the
estate between the , time of . Fair's
death and the filing of the Inventory,
which amount is not taxable, and $23,
517 09 for other expenses.
It was figured that the tax will
amount to $127,117 05, being 5 per cent
of |2,542,340 92, the present value of the
estate left by the Jate Charles L. Fair.
Most of the money will be placed to the
credit of the State school fund.
Charles Heggerty, of the law firm of
Knight & Heggerty, and Percy Tow
