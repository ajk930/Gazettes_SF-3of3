dered his wife and five young children and committed suicide : at. Mount
View, near Ross Valley station, yesterday morning!
The wife and children were shot as they lay sleeping, each through
the head. Tv.-o of them, Josephine, aged 12, and Herbert, aged 4, lived
several hours, but died at the Gruettner Sanitarium, San Rafael.
After he had exterminated the family the insane father rushed bare
headed and barefooted into the road and fired a shot at Linden Butter
field, a passing milkman. Then he placed the pistol against . his left
breast and pulled the trigger. The wound was not fatal, but the in
sane man used the weapon again and sent a' bullet into his brains. .
P'pllowing are the victims of the tragedy: Edwin B. Stephens, 36
years old; Mrs. Phosa P. Stephens, 32 years old; Josephine Ste
phens, 12 years old; Maude Stephens, 8 years" old; Edwin Stephens, 6
years old; Herbert Stephens, 4 years old, and Phosa Stephens, 14
months old.
Stephens' murderous madness came upon him just as the prospects
of his family began to brighten. A college graduate, married at an early
age to a refined and educated woman, he 'had been a failure at every
thing he had undertaken. Children came to the couple, r.nd the husband
seemed to become more helpless every day.
Her Father Sends Money to Family,
' When the entire family was on the verge' of starvation the wife's
father, R. M. Porter of Wilmington, Ohio, sent them some money. The
couple invested it in a little chicken ranch in the Marin County hills, near
Ross station.
They had a pretty nestling in a green canyon, all the hills
for the children to roam over, and, they believed, everything they
wanted. The husband bought patent incubators and began to study
scientific poultry raising, to the scorn of his neighbors. But he succeeded
at last. The chickens hatched out by the hundreds, and moderate com
fort seemed to be assured to the Stephens family.
Of course the chickens had to be fed, and the expense left very lit
tle with which to buy food for. the family. "But wait till the chickens
grow," said the patient mother. "Wait till the chickens get big," echoed
the children.
But the father became moody.. He was not satisfied with his lot.
Weakling and failure though he was, he felt that he was destined
for bigger things. He felt that he was crushed by circumstances, and
brooded over his condition. ' * - \
The wife never lost courage, nor in the hour of her direst poverty
did she lose her pride. At times, when there was barely enough to keep
herself and her babies alive, she wrote to her friends and her mother
telling of her "country villa," her pretty children and her, happiness.
This when gaunt hunger threatened and when, husband whined and
wanted to give up. His despondency had been' pronounced of late, so
much so that the eldest child, Josephine, was heard to say; "I am afraid
of my papa."
Stephens lay on a cot on the veranda .of the little cottage on
Tuesday night, thinking over what he considered a misspent and, wasted
life. A paroxysm of despair came over him and his mind gave -way.;
He became a maniac with murder in his heart. ,
Performs Deadly Deed at Dawn.
Stealthily, toward .morning, fie crept into the house; arid picked up
a 32-caliber revolver. Gently he opened the door of the room where his '
wife slept. The light. of dawn streaking in through the window lighted
her pale, patient face.
The maniac. held the muzzle of the' pistol close to her temple and \u25a0
pressed the trigger. Before the report died away he -sent a bullet into
the head of his little son, Herbert, who lay beside his mother.
Near the bed where the light fell upon her placid baby face was the
infant, Phosa, fast asleep in her cradle. Her tiny arms were outstretched
as if she wanted to be lifted up. The insane father fired a shot into the
face of the sleeping baby.
Into the other bedroom he stole. Maude and Josephine were in one
bed. The father myst have proceeded with the work with swiftness and
the cunning of a maniac. Both children were shot through the 'head.
At this point he must have reloaded the revolver, for it only contained'
t'five chambers. Then he dispatched- Edwin, his namesake, the eldest son.
Hatless and shoeless, the murdered rushed into the ' road, still Y
fired; by the lust to kill. Linden Butterfield, a dairyman, and John
Lutz, who were passing in a wagon, heard him shouting. They stopped ,
the horses and waited for him to approach. Suddenly Stephens "-lifted/his
revolver and fired at them. They drove rapidly to Ross Valley and ':
notified Sheriff W. P. Taylor.V
Maniac Pursues the Passing Milkman.
Stephens ran after the men for about 300 yards, then halted. He
. stepped under Â» an oak tree and fired- a 7 bullet ' ihto~ his : breast. As he I lay

regions showed 50 per cent diminution in pro
duction. One proprietor, .-* having 100 looms,'
said Morel, now . works thirty . and within ten
day? he will reduce this number to five. This
amounted to a general â¢ crisis in the industry,
particularly in fancy thread silks, the pro
duction of which was : only half of that ten
years ago, representing an annual loss of $18,

had a conference with Captain Seaton
Schroeder, chief intelligence officer of the
navy, on the size and efficiency of the

While. the exact facts communicated by
Captain Schroeder are not divulged, there
Is good authority for the statement that
he disclosed surprising revelations ,to the
President as to the strength of Rojestven
sky's force. . ;. ; .
It is asserted that the President was
advised that the Russian fleet was fifty
per cent stronger, than the Japenese and
that the reports of expert observers . to
the intelligence division here disclosed re
markai-.e improvements : m the 'efficiency
of tho Russian crews .through constant
drilling and maneuvering. .The., .vessels
are taid to be amply supplied with coal.
The report that the fleet had been di
vided, the swifter and stronger â vessels
separating from the; otuers, presumably
for a dash to Vladivostock, also is said to
have been communicated to Mr. Roose
velt by Captain Schroeder. ..;
The President is deeply interested in the
situation and is keeping in close touch
with it. Naval officers express* surprise
at the reported improvement in the Rus-.

based, is denied by Brokaw*s counsel.
Several letters in the case are ad

PHILADELPHIA. May 24.â ThÂ« gas
lease fight was carried Into the courts
to-day and In conseauence. the two di
rectors appointed by Mayor Weaver last
evening: are- out of office and the /di
rectors who were dismissed have again
taken up the duties of their positions.
Late In the day Mayor "Weaver, accom
panied by former Judge James Gay Gor
don, went to New York for consultation
with Ellhu Root, tbe Mayor's special
counsel. What the next move will be
cannot be foreshadowed. The leaders of
the Republican organization announce
that their lines remain unbroken, that
the gas lease will be passed over the
Mayor's veto next week and that the
lease will be ' put Into operation.
The city employes felt much relieved as
the day wore on to learn that the Mayor
had taken no further action with regard
to the removal of the heads of other de
partments.
The first move of the day was the ap
pearance before Judge Robert Ralston of
the attorneys for Peter E. Costello and
David J. Smyth, the dismissed directors,
who applied for a preliminary. Injunction
against the Mayor and A. Lincoln Acker
and Sheldon Potter, their successors In
office, restraining Acker and Potter from
assuming the duties of their respective
positions, and restraining the Mayor and
all other city employes from aiding them
In carrying out such Intentions. Jud**
Ralston granted a temporary restraining
order and fixed next Monday morning as
the time for the defendants to show
cause why the Injunction should not bÂ«
made permanent. ; .
As an evidence of the view the Mayor
takes of the situation, he ordered this
afternoon that matters pertaining to thÂ«
two departments requiring Immediate ac
tion be brought to his notice at once,
thereby assuming personal charge of
those branches of the city government
pending the outcome of the legal compli
cations. .
The committee of nine held a meetlnr
to-day and arranged for a mass-meeting
to be held in the Academy of Music on
Friday night. Among the speakers will
be former Postmaster General Smith and
Bishop Coadjutor Macmy-Sxnith of the-
Protestant -Episcopal diocese of Pennsyl
vania.
NEW YORK. May 24. â Mayor John
Weaver of Philadelphia came to New
York this afternoon to consult with
Elihu Root about his fight with tho
Philadelphia Republican organization
on the gas situation and returned to
night with a well denned plan, as out
lined by the former Secretary of War.

they did in IS6I to 1865, .rescue these
United States from impending ruin. . And,
when the call to arms is sounded, woe be

seems to those who see only the .worst;
though some despair and wring their
hands at what they, deem our. country's
sure decay, I cannot, shall not, think that
the American people will permit them
selves to suffer the fate that other peoples
have submitted to. In our land, -under
the stars and stripes, with our revolution
ary .fathers' fames before us, with the
names of Washington, Lincoln. Roose
velt: on our country's' roll of honor," with
schools, colleges, universities on every
side, with civic bodies such as this in
every city throughout the land, I, for one,
am full of faith that the American people
will soon stem the tide that to so many
seem 3 to be now bearing us to destruc
tion.
When the arguments were concluded
Judge Wallace gave the lawyers until
June 1 to file their briefs. He will then
take the matter up and render a decision.
NEW YORK, May 24.â Elihu Root and
Delaacey *Cicoll appeared before Judge
Wallace in j the United \ States Circuit
Court to-day and argued in behalf of
i-^uin V. Hale, who petitioned for a writ
Â«.f habeas corpus after he had been fined
for contempt or court in refusing , to an
swer questions before the Federal Grand
Jury In the investigation of the American
Tobacco Company's affairs. They con
tended that such investigation was llle
pal; that a specific charge against a spe
cific person was necessary to make it
proper; that it transgressed the constitu
tional rights of personal privacy, and
that the immunity provision of the Sher
man anti-trust law did not apply fo the
case of Hale. Henry W. Taft acted as
special assistant United States District
Attorney In the Inquiry, representing' the
Government. Taft argued that it was
not necessary for specific charges to be
preferred, that the Federal Grand Jury
had unlimited Inquisitorial powers; that
such action as had been taken was found
necessary owing to the scheming ability
of the alleged trust to avoid exposure.
Otherwise it would be impossible to get
at the secrets of .violators of the Sher
man act.

BEFORE THE COURT
Tho Bclentlflo world Is watching the
case of Dr. Harper with the deepest in
terest. The outcome will demonstrate the
success or failure of the new radium
treatment for the cure of cancer. Of
greater Interest . to psychologists, how
ever, is Dr. Harper's attempted 'conquest
of cancer by the power of mind over
matter. The famous educator holds ex
treme views as to man's ability to so
dominate hit physical being by thought
concentration as to overcome bodily ail
ments. Dr. Harper has been known when
pressed with work to remain continuously
at a task for three days and nights with
out sleep, overcoming fatigue by pure
strength of will. It has been claimed
that this constant demonstration of the
power of mind over matter was the real
cause of his physical breakdown.
When his physicians decided to operate
cpon him for cancer Dr. Harper told
relatives and friends that he expected to
die in the operating-room while under
the Influence of opiates. He arranged all
of his affairs with this gloomy prospect
5n view, but when he had passed the
operation and was again enabled to re
tort to the strength of his remarkable
will he confidently announced that he
would conquer the disease which had
baffled the surgeons. For a time he ap
peared to be succeeding, but of late the
reports of his condition have not been
encouraging. BSB
. "Black as "the , picture is that some have
painted for , us: ' dark wiough" -the 'i future'
Governor Pardee began by recalling the
fate of Greece and Rome, where destruc
tion followed general corruption, and dis
cussed whether the like was in store for
the United States. At the Â» very root of
the matter, he declared, lies the govern
ment of cities, "where, it is said, graft
and plunder are so prevalent that even
honest men have ceased to wonder at
it." Continuing, he said:
"And yet our people have it in their
hands to root out this evil, and, if they
will, restore that , honesty :in public af
fairs of which we all were once so proud.
San Francisco, in 1835,' was as corrupt as
any city ever was. To James King of
William and William T. Coleman, my
native city Is much ; beholden. And in
her annals, in spite of. adverse criticism,
the Vigliance Committee, in', which ; ; my
father was enrolled, will always hold a
place cf well-earned prominence.";..
Governor Pardee spoke of the glory of
the founders of the United; States; of the
history of this country, â¢including the
bloody days of the Civil War. "Short
would be the shrift," he declared, "of, him
who dared to betray our country to a
foreign foe." He said:
: "fienedict Arnolu s name is not; for
gotten. Yet, we permit ourselves to be
betrayed "in times of peace. Plodding
along in the counting-room and shop, our
people permit themselves to be: misgov
erned, apparently forgetful of the fate
of Greece and* Rome arid seemingly deaf
to the warnings of , the pact."
"It is a crime; ' abhorred of . all men, to
betray one's country in â¢ a time of war.
It is a crime, to betray one's public ; trust
in time of peace." It Is a "crime to corrupt
the ballot-box," either atla ; general or ; a
primary,, election. .; But;. while Isthe
penalty for . him who. betrays* his [country

comparatively short time awaits him who; r

Mr. Symmes then introduced Gov
ernor Pardee.
GOVERNOR PARDEE'S ADDRESS.
Mr. Symmes traced the progress of the
Merchants' Association; told of the suc
cess that had attended its efforts to . ob
tain legislation at the last session of the
California Legislature,' and caused-ap
plause when he said that two of the bills
that the association presented to the
Legislature and that were not. signed by
Governor Pardeeâ the Juror billsâ would
appear again with the Merchants' Asso
ciation behind them. The greatest ap
plause was given to Mr. Symmes when
he said with emphasis:
"Our fair city calls aloud to us to save
her from debauch, and never since the
days of '61, when called upon to help
save the country from. a national disrup
tion, has our duty been more strongly
emphasized. If we love our country, as
we do, we should love every part of it,
and stand equally to fight for her protec
tion as well against the enemy from
within as against the far more honor
able enemy from without."
Mr. Symmes' referred to the Sutter
street and Geary street reads and the
questions relating to their reconstruc
tion. He said that the Merchants' Asso
ciation had taken the ground that the
construction of any street railway in
San Francisco should be considered as a
part of an entire system that should be
adequate for the future. In a few years
an underground road would be needed on
Market street and on other thorough
fares. That was one consideration. \u25a0 The
association had invited an eminent en
gineer, William Bartlett Parsons, to come
to San Francisco and make some esti
mates concerning the cost of an under
ground street railway Bystem. Under
ground lines should be considered now.
President Symmes Introduced the sev
eral speakers. Mr. Symmes also' spoke
regarding the work of the Merchants' As
sociation during the past year, referring
to criminal prosecutions and civil actions
instituted in the interest of good govern
ment. \u25a0 ; '_ â¢
PROCEEDINGS IX DETAIL,.
The color scheme and the menu cards
were red. Roses graced the tables. Con
gressman Hepburn of lowa was expected
to be a guest, but word was received
yesterday that he will not arrive In this
city for some days.
Great applause was given to Governor
Pardee when he arose to speak. Through
out the evening applause followed the
various speeches and interrupted them.
The names of Fairfax Wheelan and Wil
liam T. Coleman received the compli
ment of prolonged cheers when they
were mentioned. A perfect storm of ap
plause followed the closing sentence in
Governor Pardee's address:
"May your efforts continue to meet
with success until every treasonous
knave who seeks to corrupt an election
fills a felon's cell, where he belongs."
The semi-annual "good, government"
dinner, of the Merchants' Association for
19J5 took place at the Palace Hotel last
evening. The custom of the association
has been to select a topic for discussion
at each dinner. This resulted in a lively
discussion last evening of "The Import
ance of the Primary Election." The
speakers were President Frank J. Symmes
of the Merchants' Association, Governor
Pardee, Senator C. 21. Belshaw, Henry
Weinstock and James H. Barry. They
sat at a table with Andrea Sbarboro,
John McNaught, T. P. Andrews. C. W.
Hornick, R. A. Crothers, A. A. Watklns
and James D. Phelan, facing the ban
queters who sat at nine " other tables.

CHICAGO. May 24.-Dr. William R.
Harper's condition it was learned to-day
is not as hopeful as his friends might
wish. This is evidenced by the fact that
his physicians made a thorough examina
tion cf the university president last
week, ar.d while it is said they found im
provement it is admitted that Dr. Harper
Is taking treatment for cancer, chiefly
In order to prolong his life. The report
that the sufferer has experienced a re
lapse was partially denied by Professor
A. W. Small, who said:
"Last week Dr. Bevan and Dr. Billings
made an examination of Dr. Harper, and
at that time they thought his condition
was improved. Physicians are watching
him. While no one dares hope for a com
plete cure, we are satisfied that the treat
ment will modify the disease and prolong
life."

Coroner Sawyer of San Rafael found a box containing white pbw 1 -.
ders in the room where Mrs. Stephens was killed. This leads some to
suspect- that the insane husband drugged his family/ so that he could \
shoot them "as they slept. The powders will be analyzed.
Mrs. Thomas Clyne, wife of an" insurance man of . San Francisco,
apparently knew more of the family than' was known by any of the
other people of the vicinity. She had often tried to assist them, but Mrs.
Stephens' pride would not permit her to accept much. . Mrs. Clyne said
that, though she kne\v that the family was in dire distress^ Mrs. Stephens
always appeared cheerful arid hopeful.
: \u25a0 .--Butterneld," the \u25a0 dairyman who was shot at, tells the following story:
"As 1 was driving through Laurel Grove at about 5:46 this morning
t heard shouts. I looked in the direction of the road and saw Stephens,:
hatless, coatless and barefooted, coming toward us, gesticulating wildly.
Thinking that there was some trouble, I stopped, ahd when within sev
enty-five yards he fired at us. He missed us, but the bullet sounded'
very close. I think I heard the pistol miss fire twice. J I drove oft; rap
idly to Ross station, and he followed me for at least a hundred arid
fifty yards. He may have run farther, but the trees separated: us. Â«
"When I returned with Sheriff Taylor we met Dr. La Chance; who
was standing by the dead body of Stephens. He went up to notify Mrs.
Stephens. We did not know at that; time that he had killed his wife
and family." . > / \ . ... ;
Mrs. Clyne said:
"I"' had been friendly with' Mrs Stephens. They both came, "from
prominent Eastern families atd were college graduates. Through mis-,
fortune they were in straitened circumstances. Mrs. Stephens received
occasional remittances from her parents. She had faith in her ability to
succeed in the poultry business recently engaged iri. They were too proud
to let people know how poor they were. If the people in the immediate
vicinity had been cognizant of it, succor woud have come."
Mrs. Alexander F; Morrison, wife of a prominent- attorney of San
Francisco, whose residence is, cose by, was at the scene of the murder
doing. what service she could render. 1 _-- : ' ;
Mrs. C. A. Meusdotffer, wife of a well-known .architect of San Fran-/,
cisco, heard the fatal Shots.
Mrs. Stephens Was Well Connected*
. writhing y on the grass he Jired. another into his brain, thus .^finishing, his \_
work *of 'extermination. * â¢ Â» ' 'â¢"
Sheriff Taylor hurried to the place and on the way met Joseph, La
Chance, a "divine healer," "who. had found the body of Stephens. No one
in the neighborhood had heard the shots in the. cottage. â¢
La Chance went to the house, thinking he_woiild break the news of
her husband's suicide to the wife. He knocked several times, then finally
entered through the open door. \ A number of young chickens followed'
him. .' .\u25a0â¢:\u25a0}â¢ - r .Â»\u25a0 ""'-'....' :''.'\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0
When he got one glance at the interior 'of the slaughter-pen he.'
called the Sheriff. Josephine and Herbert were still alive, ami -Taylor: â¢
hurried to the.nearest telephone and notified Dr. W. J. Wickharn of San;
Rafael, fvho arrived in .a short time. The two dying children were taken -\u0084

SHOT BY A WOMAN
GOOD GOVERNMENT BANQUET.
"The President has good qualities, but
humane education has been neglected. I
consider him an educated bulldog, with
the humane side of his make-up lacking.
"I have always opposed his holding the
various important offices that he has held.
on the ground that some time he wculd
get us into a dangerous 'war, as, in my
opinion. -he got us into the Spanish war.
I think that he is the most dangerous
man in the country.
"If President Roosevelt had done in
Massachusetts what was said to have
been done en his recent hunting trip In
Colorado, camely. hunt a bear which had
Just teen turned loose from a cage. I
would have prosecuted him to the full
extent of the law, unless, as President,
he should be exempt from prosecution."
It seerss to us, e&ylng ncthlr.g cf Its effects
en the youth cf our country, that the Presi
dent of the United States has more important
duties Than to spend two racr.hs in the wilds
hur:ti^g t\-iia animals, which. If xhey have any
chanoe for "a square deal" tAdefend them
eeivc-s, rcight endanger his lif^or his ability
to perform the duties cf President. It sÂ»emÂ»
to us that, instead of being entitled to any
credit for such performance, he is deserving cf
a vote cf censure from both houses cf Congress.
The magazine severely attacks Mr.
Roosevelt for having, it charges, shot
a Spaniard In the back during the
Spanish-American war, of which act,
it alleges, the President boasted in a
magazine article signed by himself.
BOSTON. May 24.â "What a bad ex
ample President Roosevelt sets to the
yo^tb of our country by his hunting ex
pedition. He teaches them to believe that
bunting and war and bloodshed are the
chief things in life." said George T.
Ar-gell, the venerable president of the
Massachusetts Society tor the Prevention
cf Cruelty to Animals, to-day. He had
been asked to comment on the barring of
a recent copy of the paper "Our Dumb
Animals" from the Washington public
schools.
Wo hope tire time is coming (for which our
American Humane Education Society is work
ir.g) when humane education shall be given in
all cur schools, colleges ana universities, and
our Institutions of lemming shall no longer be
fending out educated Bavaees to endanger the
peace not only of lower creatures, but of hu
man bel&gs as well.
This is signed by George T. Angell, who
is president of the Massachusetts Hu
rpane Society. Another article signed by
,-i.r.gell says:
CAL.L BUREAU. POST BUILDIXO,
WASHINGTON. May 24 âBy order of A.
T. Stuart, Superintendent of the Public
Schools, the Hay issue ot Our Dumb
Animals, which contains a criticism of
President Roosevelt for having killed
g&sie on his recent hurting trip, has been
excluded from the schools of the District
of Columbia. Superintendent Stuart de
clared to-night the action was not taken
on any suggestion from the White House
or frcm any of the President's friends.
One of the articles says:

At' present the tariff- against the Philip
pines is "5 pÂ«r cent of the present Dingley
tariff, and under this practically no imports
reach the United: States from thÂ« Philippines.
The friends of the Philippines look forward to.
thÂ« coming session of -Congress with confidence
that a measure of Justice will be meted out to
the islands. We shall hold the Philippines,
certainly for a generation, probably for sev
eral generations, in our effort to lead the peo
ple on to education and prosperity and a knowl
edge of self-government, and during the time
we must take these islands to our bosom, so
to speak, and give them the advantages cf a
member of our family.
The committee on resolutions met
after the adjournment " of the. conven
tion, selected Senator Dick as chair
man and listened to the reading of the
draft of the platform, which indorsed
President Roosevelt and his policies. . A
slightly modified railroad rate plank
was understood to be acceptable .to
Taft, as the person having closest
knowledge of the views of the Presi
dent.
Speaking of thej Philippines, he said:
Secretary Taft Bald that never be
fore hae the influence of the United
States for good been greater than to
day, because it is known that with a
navy of most respectable proportions,
should it unfortunately be engaged in
such a conflict, it is ready to protect
itself.
. Secretary Taft discjissed the.deficlt in
the revenues and said the Ttepubllcans
must provide a suitable means of avoid
ing a real and permanent shortage of
cash if next year witnesses a repetition
of the deficit. In this connection, he
eaid:
There are two alternates, either to Impose
additional internal taxes or to readjust and
revise the tariff. We have repealed the war
taxes, which afforded a large revenue,, and
the eight years of the present Dlnglcy tariff
have seen in this country a prosperity never
before witnessed In the civilized world. If
the dÂ«Scit continues in serious amount, then
in' one way or the other, either our taxation
on imports or our internal revenue system
must be changed to meet the 'shorts tre, with
every effort to cause the minimum of business
disturbance.
ilr. Bryan represents an element ' cf the
Democratc party that is . hastening as rapidly
as possible toward a doctrine In which vested
interests are little regarded. He is now for
mulating a doctrine in favor of the Govern
ment ownership of commercial railroads â¢to
which hÂ« hopes to lead his party. Against
this preposition I feel confident the Republican
party win always set its face like flint." I
only refer to it as Mr. Bryan's remedy for the
abuses of which, it is said, the railroad com
panies are guilty and as an additional' reason
why. if such abuses exist, as in some measure
we know they do. we should take all reason
able steus to remedy them in the direction of
an increased and effective power of govern
mental .supervision and regulation, in order. to
meet the argument that Government ownership
Is thÂ« only cur*.
This question muet be settled by the Re
publicans. The Republican party by its ene
mies is falsely charged with being a party of
thÂ« corporations and a party of the wealthy.
The history of its sacrifices In favor of human
lights, and of its oonteets for individualism
against socialism Is a trumphant refutation of
the charge.
WÂ« can certainly trust our law-eirers to re
spond to the popular demand and to regulate
vhe railways, so far as they ought to be
regulated, without Interfering with that control
over their own property and with that motive
for efficiency and economic management which
are still required to make successful the enor
mous business of railway transportation in
America.
The Secretary said that the interstate
commerce law had accomplished much,
but that inequality and injustice re
mained. Discussing the proposed rem
edial bill as It passed the House of Rep
resentatives, the Secretary said it "at
tempts to give more power to the rail
road commission so 'that its order, when
made, shall be effective until set aside
by Judicial hearing. He added:
The tremendous victory of last fall .so
stunnod o-t ancient enemy, the Democratic
party, that It as a. party is hardly even- now
showing slens of life. When a President like
Theodore Roosevelt, a consistent and orthodox
Republican, is welcomed with bursts of eri
thusUcm and admiration in Texas and in the
Democratic IrcÂ«juois Club of Chicago, we may
wall liken the present to the era of political
g-ood feeling: which prevailed early In the last
century-
COLUMBUS, Ohio, May 24. â Although
the opening session of the Republican
State Convention' was of a very routine
character, consisting chiefly of the an
nouncement of the committees and
State committeemen whom the district
delegations had chosen earlier in the
day. the fact that Secretary of War W.
H. Taft,'ihe temporary chairman, was
to make his debut in .his native State
as a convention orator drew a large
and very attentive audience.
Taft's appearance in the hall was the
signal for applause, and when he was
introduced as 4 the presiding o^Hcer the
demonstration was long continued. Dur
ing the reading of his speech hearty ap
plause was given to the mention of
President. Roosevelt and to the Presi
dent's, actions or policy, while occa
sionally a turn of expression caught the
fancy of the crowd and brought out
cheers. Taft said in part:

without an electric road. The Interurban
system Is considered to be an adjunct, ef.
the Southern^Paclflc Company and tha
proposed extension Is viewed aa an effort
to shut out another corporation which
has under consideration a project 'to con
nect San Jose. Palo Alto and the. town
of San Mateo. Were such an electric rail- .

fund, with a promise of a like amount
â¢when the college should raise '$5000.
From other sources the endowment
fund has been Increased $1618 50 during

Mr.- and Mrs. F. M. Smith had given
$2000 for the employment of three more
instructors for the next year; and had

enthusiastic applause; " '
The Rev. W. H. Hopkins, D. D. t of
Berkeley was introduced as the speaker
of the day and in his address, the sub
ject-of which was "The Crown of Cul
ture," he said:
The ch*r*t is not that we neglect the

OAKLAND, May 24.â The question
whether Mrs. Charlotte Arthur, who Is
at present suing: the Oakland Traction
Consolidated for $10,000 damages, is a
divorced woman is one that may cvi
a considerable figure in the case be
fore it is finished. She says "that she
was divorced from a Peter J. Rail ton
of West Superior, Wis., some years ago.
He telegraphed the attorneys for the
railroad to-day that theY were not di
vorced,, so far as he knows.* She says
she got the decree*, but that it was
burned. She is suing: under the name
of a former husband, and attorneys
for. the defense will endeavor to show
before the trial is completed that a
nonsuit should be granted on the
ground that it is not her proper name.
Motion was. made,, this morning by
'Attorney.' Bell for the railway, asking
for a continuance of the case until he
could have Railton's deposition taken,
but Judge Ellsworth refused this, as
he stated that there was nothing :to
show his contention was . the correct
one in the face of the evidence that the
wife .had: got the decree. An effort,
however, will be made \ to establish
just what the relation of Mrs. Arthur
to Railton is, if any.-"'
The appropriation, which has been
made in the name of William T. Bagr
sett, an attorney of San Francisco, is
in the interests, it is said, of a number
of Oakland men who have in mind the
development of a large corporation to
handle the project. Among 1 those saicl
to be interested are J. S. Emery j and
the estate of Isaac L. Requa, late pres-;
ident of the Oakland Bank of Savings.
Plans of the promoters of the enter
prise are in embryo.* The â¢ general
scheme Includes a future tender of
the supply to the city, together with
the construction of pipe lines, pump
ing stations, distributlngr reservoirs
and all of the necessary equipment of a
system. The appropriation Is equal to
a supply daily of j 216,000,000 gallons.
This withdrawal, made under the gen
eral laws of the State covering use of
water for irrigation and [other pur
poses, is the' nucleus of the proposi
tion. It Is intended later to further
the project by graining support of cap
italists. The project is- temporarily in
abej'ance owing to the illness of At
torney Bagrgpett, .ntho. has to undergo a
surgical operation.
OAKLAND.- May 24. â First steps
toward the development of a new
water supply for Oakland have been
taken by the filing in San Joaquin
County of an appropriation of 15,000
inches of water a day from the . San
Joiiquin River, the point of withdrawal
being, approximately fifty, miles from
this city.
. in regard to the transaction the pres
ent firm . of Holcomb, Breed & Ban
croft says that;, it has no interest . in
the matter, and in this connection Mr.
Breed says: V "Whatever the transac
tion was, it. took place before, we took
charge of and incorporated the present
company. There was some deal on be
tween them, but the business did not
come to us, and we are in no way re : ,
sponsible for It."
OAKLAND, May 24.-â Action to, re
cover $9250 was begun- this afternoon
by A.- E. Williams, father of Minnie
Williams, who was one of the Durrant
victims, against \u25a0 Myron T. Holcomb,
who. disappeared recently \u25a0 from >thls
city. According -to Williams, who was
at one time interested 'in some deals
with Holcomb, he held an option on
the Pauba Temecula and Santa Rosa
ranchos, valued at . $25,000, under > a
contract, with t.Â»e Cosmos Land and
Water; Company and was to receive
from the company $5000 in commis
sion for the sale of the lan d. ".,
; His cause for complaint is that Hol
comb, as vice president of the Y old
Heron-Holcomb \u25a0 Company, promised to
take the sale off his- hands for half
of the commission. Williams states that
he paid Holcomb $3000, but that j Hol
comb failed. not! only '.to -'sell. .the' land
but he allowed the option to expire,
and altogether he says that he is out
the sum of '$9250 on the transaction.
The. Heron-Holcomb Company is also
made a defendant in the action.

STANFORD "UNIVERSITY, May. 24.â
Senior week \u25a0 festivities were, brought to
a close this "morning by the fourteenth
annual commencement exercises in As
sembly' Hall. This afternoon- the college
doors v were closed for the summer vaca
tion and almost all the Btudents left . the
campus for. their homes. .: Two .hundred
and nineteen diplomas were awarded to
members* of the graduating class and ad
vanced students in the different" univer
sity â¢ departments. The ceremony of con
ferring the - degrees ] was witnessed by a
large crowd "of admiring friends and rela
tives'of the graduating students. ,
"Get : Into the Game," was the com
mon college phrase that Dr. David Starr
Jordan chose as a text for his farewell
address to the class, of 1905. "Get into the
game," he said.. "Every Stanford man or
woman is by birthright from his alma
mater a member of the first te.am. "\u25a0â¢ .
"Scholarship in Terms of Action" was
the subject of the address, which, though
brief, was â¢ full of virility and inspiration
for the "\u25a0 young men and | women whom iit
ushered, into .the greater affairs of life.
In it Dr. Jordan" paid an eloquent tribute
to, the memory' of Mrs. Jane L. Stanford,
whose life he held up to the graduates
as an example of a life lived worthily
and nobly. - - ' . â¢
Preceding . the farewell < by , President
Jordan the main commencement address
was - delivered by Professor Charles _ D.
Marx of . tho â¢ department v of -^' civil â¢ en
gineering. He spoke on "General Educa
tion of Engineers," 'applying the doctrine
of broad education to all departments ; of
scientific knowledge, with particular ref
erence to engineers. \u25a0 * â¢ > \u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0"

Manager Russ Hall of the Siwashes

of ths St. Louis Nationals, will decorate
second for the Seattle gang. - In the
meantime O'Brien, a busher from Fresno,
is doing the honors. He made his debut
yesterday and played a fairly good game.
The score: '
The Siwashes seemed to realize they
were in after that time and their work
became a bit tiresome and sloppy. The
native band reached Mr. Hair again in
the sixth and hammered- three more
through. This was accomplished by Hil-.
debrand's TexasJeaguer, a pass to Neal
on and a couple from the clubs of Goch
nauer and "Wilson.
"Slivers" Henley did not have to use a
spitball or do "any stalling: in order to
show the Siwashes up yesterday at Rec
reation Park. They could not get a bin-
Ble in a tight place if it meant a million
dollars. /Meanwhile Uncle's tribe had the
bingling habit in two innings, and it
stuck so well that runs came in bunches.
Scoreâ San Francisco 6, Seattle L
Hall started out with a bunch of speed,
and the fans marveled. So did the Seals,
but only for a few innings. Spencer be
gan the rally in the fourth with a sizzler
to right. Mohler drew a four-spot and
Hilde sacrificed. Along came Irwin with
one that nearly took off Hall's ear.- It
scored both men and was going so fast in
center field that McHale booted it. Irwin
did the steal act and Wilson drew four.
Together the veterans pulled off a double
steal, making it three , for Uncle as a
starter. 1

hand in hand with this great enemy, and man has always hated and fought'
it as he has no other disease. It is the most powerful of all poisons; no mat-
ter how pure the blood may be, when its virus enters, the entire circulation
becomes poisoned and its chain of horrible ; symptoms begin, to _ahbw.- : -Usu-
ally the first sign is a small sore or ulcer, not at all alarming in appearance, -
but the blood is being saturated with the deadly poison^ and soon the mouth
and throat begin to ulcerate, the hair and eyebrows 'drop 6utÂ» a red eruption .*
breaks out on the body, cop"per-colored splotches^ and sores- make their
appearance and the poison even works down into the bones and attacks
the nerves. Not only is the disease hereditary, being" transmitted from.-
parent to child, in the form of scrofula, weak eyes, ; soft bones, weak, puny;
constitutions, etc., but is also so highly contagious' that" many a life has
been ruined by a friendly hand shake, or from using the toilet articles of:
one infected with the poison. To cure this blighting, deadly'cursej the'

- As an antidote to the Globe writer's extravagances it may be
said that it is not expected that more than two million acres on the,
whole public domain can be subjected to Federal irrigation. As'
any land-owner within reach of a Federal plant may use the water;
provided the settlers on the public land can spare it, there will be a
considerable extension of the service over private lands. The im
agination that can see this Nevada plant spreading water over three
hundred million acres may be characterized as "a corker." In -the
whole State of Nevada there are seventy million acres of land, and
this writer must intend not only to irrigate it on both sides, but to
slice it and irrigate both sides of the slices.
To show the difference between such pipe dreams and the
facts we refer our readers tq-the plain and reliable statement of
Mr/ Henry Thurtcll, State Engineer of Nevada, in our Nevada edi
tioo. He says: "When one considers that 500.000 acres is a liberal
estimate of the total amount of land now Hinder cultivation in
Nevada, and that this (the same irrigation) project/ will probably
reclaim 250,000 acres of new land, it will be seen how much these
works mean to Nevada." Mr. Thurtell understands the noble "rhet
oric of understatement. The addition of 50 per cent to the pro
ducing lands of a State, is sufficiently stupendous without clothing
the project in the. fleeting garlands of the imagination.
A WRITER in the Boston Globe breaks out in a smallpox of
enthusiasm over the Federal irrigation district that is to be
opened in Nevada on June 17. He says that the plant will
supply a million acre feet of water and that it is to irrigate and
make fruitful "three hundred million acres of land, richer than the
delta of the Nile."
*! It was a sad day when the delta of the Nile and the Assouan
darl entered American irrigation oratory and literature. They have
conveyed the same error that has been. propagated by thj2 assump
tion that irrigation everywhere in the arid region is to produce the
same variety and value of crops that it does in California. Every
practical man knows that this is not so. Even in the same latitude
it is useless to hope for such a result, for latitude has little to do
with our climate. The. Globe writer gets his inspiration from the
vocal irrigators of the West, who make a fad of it for the sake of
the' spectacular exits and entrances they can make at Irrigation
congresses arid other public meetings. They are the romancers and
fictionists .of the matter and are the laughing stock of practical
irrigators. \u25a0 '

The world is full of mothers like youâ
mothers who follow the traditional idea
that service means servitude and neglect
of self. God gave you yourself to cherish
and, develop. Why should you! ignore the
charge? When you, neglect yourself you
do, in a sense, ignore the command of
your Creator.
Of course you have not intended to do
this. Your motive was right â your im
pulse was beautiful and noble â the true
longing of mother love and devotion. But
in your anxiety to fulfill that ideal you
have gone far beyond- the requirements.
You have turned unselfishness into a fault
instead of a virtue.'
my dear woman, lies in your own con
fession that all your life you have sacri
ficed yourself for your children, demand
ing "absolutely nothing" In return.
, By your own attitude you have taught
your children to, neglect you and to dis
regard your right 8. By your own actions
you have fostered this tendency in them.
You have planted selfishness in their na

Our correspondent, the chairman of the purity of streams sec
tion of the California Cluh, cites a similar case in the harbor of
Santos. Brazil. Santos is in latitude 24 south, which puts it below
the Tropic of Capricorn. The extremity of Florida is in 25 north
iaiitude, so Santos is hardly under' more tropical conditions than
San Francisco, except for the different climatic conditions of the
two coasts. Filling San Francisco Bay with sewage will finally
develop into a nuisance and then into a peril. Cities on the Atlantic
seaboard are becoming uncomfortable in the presence of the same
problem. American cities are generally woefully behindhand in
the disposition of their waste, whether the material be dry, moist or
semi-fiuid. To make a proper and sanitary disposition of this waste
is a function of government. It concerns the public health " and ,wel~
fare, and these are the supreme law. Government in our cities has
stopped short of its duty in this matter. This neglect is the odium
of our municipalities. Some people are almost fanatical in their
desire to follow the example of European cities in municipal owner
ship of public utilities. Before the American municipality ceases to
govern and goes into business, subjecting itself to the law of cor
porations, would it not be well for it to first discharge all of its
governmental functions?
San Francisco is about to take out of the general fund and
spend on municipalizing the Geary-street road an unknown and
indefinite sum that may be a million before the work is finished.
This money devoted to the concentration and sanitary treatment
of the city's sewage would improve the public health, sweeten the
waters of the bay. arrest shoaling as far as the solids of sewage
contribute to it and would put San Francisco in line with the best
modern methods. As it is now, this and nearly all American cities
in the disposition of their waste are so little in advance of Asiatic
cities that they must, from the standpoint of sanitary science, be
put' in the same class. Yet the majority of American cities are
being besought to divert public funds to the acquisition of public
utilities, leaving sanitary treatment of waste on the Asiatic plane.
It would be well for public bodies, clubs and organizations to
combine their forces and insist that cities shall first govern effi
ciently in all things within their jurisdiction, including the disposi
tion of waste. When municipal administration Is proved capable
of. this it will be time to embark in business.
IT is the subject of congratulation that a section of the California
Club has charge of questions relating to the purity of streams
and is prepared to support the Board of Health and the Fish
and Game Commission in their crusade against defilement .of the
waters. American cities have been singularly derelict in this mat
ter. There has been a too comforting conclusion, supposed to be
of expert origin, that a certain volume of water moving in a river
would disinfect and render innocuous a certain volume of sewage.
Along American rivers the city highest up stream takes its potable
water out of the river and puts its sewage back. The next city
below does the same, and so the stream goes on accumulating
sewage, but the people who use the water are happy in the disin
fecting theory and wonder why they have typhoid fever and other
tilth diseases.
It is now known that the microbes, or bacilli, of cholera and
ether pestilences are carried by water if discharged into streams.
The safest potable water supply for a city is from a well-guarded
catchment basin that receives no sewage because the water im
pounded from it gets no germs of sewage-borne diseases. In the
last cholera epidemic in Europe, from which Spain suffered
especially, the origin of the disease was traced. It was found that
a sailor had left his ship in Marseilles and gone to his native town
on the headwaters of the Guadalquiver. Immediately upon his
arrival he developed cholera and died. The town sewered into the
river and in due time cholera appeared down the river wherever
its water was taken for domestic use. The volume of water in
motion in that stream was entirely ineffective in its action upon
the cholera microbe.
The old theory of the antiseptic action of water upon sewage
must be given up. It is disproved by the experience of Chicago.
That city discharged its sewage into the lake and took its potable
water from the lake. The sewage crept farther and farther out on
the bottom of the lake until it got beyond the crib which .took the
oity water. The result is a supply of water so bad that a principal
function of the Board of Health is in preventing its use unless
boiled. This inability to disinfect sewage is not confined to fresh
water. Salt water will do something in that way, but it is far from
perfection as a disinfecting agent. The harbor of Havana, receiving
sewage ever since the city was built, in spite of the action of the
tides is a body of foul water. Sailors disliked that port on this
account. The harbor is only a slight indentation of the coast and
is aided by the action of the near ocean, but it could by no means
take care of the sewage discharged into it. Havana has only, half
the population of San Francisco, and yet its sewage waste has
clogged its harbor.
DEFILING THE WATERS.
Looking forward to it as the happiest
day of his life, â¢ Horace found that
standing beside :the dearest girl in the
world even for half an hour more than
fulfilled his expectations. - That a
Etorm should be corning -up over the
lake was not of. the slightest-conse
quence. Minna liked storms, and the
two went upon' the hurricane deck*of
the steamer, the better, to Â«cc Its ap
proach. . There. they were quite alone,
the motion of trie boat sending the rest
One eventing when he "was giving
himself the generally denied 'pleasure
of her society he heard her mother say
that the family was going to take a
steamer to Milwaukee the next Sunday.
Learning from the conversation that it
,wasto bo a family party, he plucked
up courage and asked if he might go
with them. The answer did not come
with any marked heartiness, but" It
came â and he was thankful . for the
smallest favor.
All- the boys called him Fattyâ there
was nothing: else to express it. Even
the girls â and Horace was fond \u25a0of
girls from infancyâ could not call him
anything else be- *
hind his back and
sometimes could not
avoid using the ob
noxious term to
his very face. He
was denied the us
ual privileges of
running and. jump
ing* with his fel
lows, for his mus
cle failed to devel
op when his adi
pose tissue . was
working overtime,
and he had no play
mates the
girls.
When the other
boys went on long
jaunts in the sum
mer weather, with
a swim at the end
of them, Horace
waddled around the
house or went to
see some rare girl
who could stand \
the subB c q v ent
laughter of her in
timates. No one
could ever conceal .
the fact that 'Hor
ace Lardwell called
on her. People used
to turn about in the
street and try to
watch him out of
sight. But one girl
out of all the lotâ
and a pretty girl,
too, Minna Memory
â never was out
when he went to i
see her, and would j
even go with him to
places as they grew
older.
Nedless to say,
Horace could not
dance. But he used
sometimes to take
Minna to dances 1
and watch her
dance with others.
He came to worship j
the very ground she i
walked on â or he \u25a0
would have done so \
if it had been worth
while. And he knew
all the time that it
was pity for his \u25a0
loneliness . rather
than any affection
for himself that
was at the bottom
of her kindness.
Horace Â«was t :an
unhappy". t>6y/ ! ''tte 3

flesh. Sometimes hel
spent a foolish mo-,
ment hating "a
great-grandmother of his, long gone to
her rest, from whom his tendency' to
take on fat was supposed to come. He
grew heavier and bulkier with every
year. And Minna was his one gleam
of perpetual sunshine, hopeless as he
felt his. chances to be..
Horace left, school and , went into
business â after a long time, when he
could flndvnobody that could be made
to believe that so stout a person as he
\u25a0would not be lazy. Once given his
chance, he profited by it. He was no
genius, but he was aware of the fact
and devoted himself to his work with
a single-mlndedness that won his slow
and sure promotion. He used to call on
Minna often, until it became clear to
him that his attentions were keeping
other men she was certain to like.bet
ter at a distance; then his visits- air
most ceased. He was with her often
in his thoughts, howeverâ no one could
stop that. . _ *' " ,
Mr. and Mrs. Lard well almost de
spaired. They were (far from being
rich â and the only ' clothing Horace
could wear had to be made for him.
Before he was*, five years older the ex
tra men's sizes proved wanting. There
never was a bigger boy for his age who
did not end in the circus sideshow'or
the dime museum.
HORACE LARDWELL was a fat
boy. There was no disguising
nor modifying: the fact..* He had
not been a remarkably fat baby, his
parents recalled with a sigh/ but when
some ten swift springs had flown over
his head he began to swell like the
frog in the fable. -He grew tall as
well, but his increase in height was
as nothing to his increase in girth. \u25a0 ";\u25a0'

Mutual Life Insurance Company, that
the Pacific States Savings, Loan' and
Building Company, of which the de
fendants named are also directors,
loaned to individuals and not to the
Decimal Company the $14,000, of which
$9000 is Involved. The loan was a per
sonal one to the directors and is se
cured by gilt-edge bonds. This state
ment was made by Mr. Reis on the
stand and corrects the belief that the
Pacific States Company was out the sum
it- loaned the Decimal.
"The loan is covered by gilt-edge
security," said- Mr. Reis, "and can be
collected in half an hour it^the Pacific
States Company desires. In fact J. will
advance the money at a moment's no
tice, so it is apparent that the Impres
sion that the Pacific States has lost this
$9000 is absurd. The loan was made in
the general order of business and ac

the Pacific States has lost nothing." ":\u25a0':'\u25a0

the 'most beautiful in the world, and.
because water was a necessary factor
in the beautification, he supplied the
funds" for Mhe erection of what will be
.theilargrest V windmill ever \ built. The
power genet ated, as computed by en-,
glneers," will he great enough to force
the water from the -ocean to the top of.

The coin for the project' was put in
the hands of Park Commissioner Lloyd

SALVATION COMMAXDER
:J "_ '; ARRIVES IS THE CITY
\Next Monday night at the Columbia
.Theater John Drew will make his ap
pearance in Captain Robert Marshall's
farcical romance, "The Duke of Killi
crankie." Among those appearing in the
star's support are Margaret Dale, Fanny
Brough, Kate Lester and Ferdinand
Gottschalk.
\u25a0 As a dramatist the career of Captain
.Robert Marshall has been a steadily pro
gressive one. Perhaps its secret lies in
the fact that the captain never does any
thing hurriedly; .a year or two, perhaps
even three, will be expended upon a play
in the determination that at the end it
possess . acting merits and literary finish.
This young writer has but four plays to
his credit, but invariably his latest is his
best. "A Royal Family" was superior to
"His Excellency- the Governor"; "S%cohd
in Command" has greater popularity
than either; but the largest audiences
and the longest runs have been accorded
to "The Duke of Killicrankie."
The piece is being produced in England
simultaneously with its American per
formances, and in America its unprece
dented success must be largely attributed
to the perfect acting of its title role by
John Drew. . .._. ._ â¢ ; / ,â¢>

, A new company- will probably be in
corporated to build the road, work upon
which will ;be commenced about the
beginning of- the new year. It , is
planned to eventually make the line a
part of a big electric road system that
is to soon to connect the various towns

poses to bid for freight as well as pas
senger traffic business in that section

G. ; Edwards " ways lie resumed \u25a0"from his posi
tion as deputy poundmaster \u25a0 and was not - fll9
mlssed, as has been : erroneously published. \u0084, â¢
; United States District Attorney Robert
T. Devlin made the closing argument on
behalf of the Government. Among other
things he said: "If your verdict is for
acquittal youâthen say to every public
official in the State of California you can
steal with impunity because there is no
law to punish you, and no jury will en
force the law. But, oh the other hand,
gentlemen, a verdict of guilty will clear
up the moral atmosphere of San Francisco
and will be a warning to others to re
frain from purloining the funds of the
people."
Judge de Haven instructed the jury as
to the sixty-nine counts of the indict
ment, charging as many occasions of
larceny, and explained the distinction be
tween larceny and embezzlement. He said
that mere delay or neglect to pay over
the funds does hot constitute the crime of
embezzlement. He charged the jury fur
ther that the previous good character of
the defendant was a factor in the casfi
and the defendant was entitled to the
benefit of that factor.
The jury -retired at half past three in
the afternoon and shortly afterward
asked for the exhibits in the case and also
for the instructions. The exhibits were
sent up, but the instructions -had not been
written but by the shorthand reporter.
Cress Unger's fate is In the hands of,a
jury that was locked up last night for
further deliberations on the case of the
employe who is charged
with embezzling aoyernment money. It
looks as if a" disagreement' were possible.
The jury, after being out (our hours,
announced that it had not agreed and
the order that, it be : locked up for the
night was made by the court.
Bert Schlesinger was followed in the
morning by Seth Mann of counsel for the
defendant. Both counsel contended that
Unprer had not committed any crime un
der the Section under which he had been
indicted; that the mere delay in trans
ferring funds from the seizure clerk's
room to the cashier of the Custom-house
did not constitute either larceny or em
bezzlement.

When the Food Is Xot Suited.
When Nature gives her signal that
something Is wrong it Is generally with
the food; the old Dame is always faith-
ful and. one should act at once.
To put off the change is to risk that
â¢which may be irreparable. An Ari-
zona man says:
"For years I could not safely eat any
breakfast. I tried all kinds of break-
fast foods, but they were all soft,
starchy messes, which gave me dis-
tressing headaches. I drank strong
coffee, too, which appeared to* benefit
me at the time, but added to the head-
aches afterward. Toast and coffee
were no better, for I found the toast
very constipating.
"A friend persuaded me to quit the
old coffee and the starchy breakfast
foods, and use Postum Coffee and
Grape-Nuts instead. I shall never re-
gret taking his advice. I began using
them three months ago.
"The change they have worked In
me is wonderful. I now have no more
of the distressing sensations In my
stomach after eating and I never have
any headaches. I have gained twelve
pounds In weight and feel better In
every way. Grape-Nuts make a deli-
clous as well as a nutritious dish, and
I find that Postum Coffee Is easily di-
gested and never produces dyspepsia
symptoms." .-T

CRUELTY OF A BROKER
COSTS HDI HIS WIFE
"During the ten days which have
elapsed since this talk of calling our
men out began we have been preparing
ourselves to meet the emergency when
it presented Itself."
â¢'Th.Â« contract provides for arbitration
izi cew of differences, but this was ig
rcred and we were never consulted as to
why they were going out. In fact. If we
wÂ«re cor.sulted we would be powerless to
prevent it, being that this entire fight is
no affair of ours. The dlJSculty Is with
the brewers in the north, not here in San
KrÂ£::?iFco. Why should men employed
in San Francisco be compelled to quit
work because certain men in the State
of Washington have a grievance which
carrot be adjusted?
â¢'Even tfiose employes who figure It to
their interest to obey the calls of the un
106 teave us with regTet They have en
deavored to stave off this matter. In
fact* this call was issned ten days ago,
hut owing to the efforts of the local bot
tlâ¬rs. drivers and other labor organiza
tions to have it rescinded it did not be
come effective until to-day.
"The national organisation of brewery
workmen, in Cincinnati, was petitioned
to rescind this call, but they fatted to
pay any attention to this petition. The
mea involved have never been consulted
as to their wishes. There has been ho
noting called in which they could voice
their pentimenta or state their wishes.
They have simply beea ordered to quit
wcrk. and those of them who figured
that their interests lay with, obeying the
union simply obeyed the command. For
what reason they are out they do not
knotr. Ie leaving us they hare violated
a written contract entered into between
ri:rfÂ»:vfs and the union.
At a meeting of the executive commit
tÂ«? cf the Brewery Workmen's Union
held Tuesday evening it was resolved to
call tfc** men employed in the â¬atabli6h
rnents cf the agents of the Northwestern
Brewre' Association ia a sympathetic
strike. This will involve in San Fran
cisco about 100 men, and in the State of
Califcrr.ia about 250 men.
John Rap? & Son, agftnts for Rainier
beer, alone employ about fifty men be-
Icnsing to the union. J. G. Rapp In an
Ir.terview ftates that the majority of
these tr.cn will oM go out.
"All cf cur men are gatisflea with ex-
Irting cenfi'-tionF. They are working un
der union contracts, which do not expire
for ere year, and so far as we are con
cerned ttiÃ contract has been lived up
to to the letter ever since our entering
Into It.

NEW TORK, May 24.â There was substan
tial strength in to-day's stock market, as was
tvldencea by the length of the list of stocks
which were lifted between 1 and 2 pclnts dur
ing tht day's trading and In a lew exceptional
Inttajicef more than that. The trading uttered
a number of remarkable features, one was
the small volume of the demand on which the
m<^et â¢ notable gains were allected. To-day's
ti Â»nsaciioDÂ£ fell below those cf either yester
day or the day before. If the buying was for
the account of uncovered shorts it was dÂ«
claediy free from any sign of urgency or such
vrepiuatjen as the bear trader ehort on stocks
usuaity manifests:. There wa6 rather Tree sell
ing uuring the first hour owing to the wide ad
vance* at which prli-ii opened, frices have
made to many false starts toward recovery
that sentiment haÂ» become extremely euapl
clous of thefce sudden advances over night,
which have melted away during the day in
more than one ln6tar.ee lately. The same sus
picious attitude was manifested by the pro
lessional element to-day. At different stages
of the advaJice the market Â«ank into practical
nagrmtion. but th* ground yielded on such oc
casions was insignificant. There was no deti
rite nÂ«-ws to account for the movement and.
In lact. some of the day's developments might
1* regarded as additions to factors recently
rtgiua.u as unfavorable. The grain markets
still had their crop damage reports. The Chi
cago s r;ke situaticn seemed aggravated and
in danger of spreading. The Secretary of War
outlined fresh administration views for the
regulation of corporations. But the consider
ation cf these matters had apparently lost
foroe. The Northwestern Kailroad problem, on
the other hand, thowed a perennial freshness.
The revival of rumors that an agreement
had been reached among the railroad powers
in hat fii.i' i lefratu from hostilities was the
real effective force back of the day's market.
The \u25a0 x-rial nr>minÂ«r.e of Union Pacific, St.
'Paul, Northern Pacific. Northwestern and Great
Northern preferred were thus accounted for.
The extreme Â«ase in the money market on the
eve of to-morrow's $(50,000,000 requirement for
the final installment of the Japanese loan sub
scripticn was a fostering Influence on the
etrtnj?th of stocks. The reception of the Iron
Aee'E weekly trade review was in marked
contrast to the depression caused a week ago,
aÃhough that authority's view cf the trade
has not altered ia any material respect.
."Prices are weaker." Rays the review, "and
buyers are holding oft* convinced that a sonoe
trtiat lower level in pig iron will be reached."
The United States Steel stocks, however,
moved, upward with the rest of the market
ajvJ the rush amcnÂ«r belated buyers made the
closing tone very bouyant.

Genernl Merchandise.
Late mall advices from New York say:
"Easy conditions exist in the money mar
ket and promise to continue until crop de
rcands assert themselves In the autumn. For
eign exchange has been strong and in good
demand, and there is rtill eorr.e talk, of gold
experts at no distant date. Toward the end
of the month some heavy remittances will
have to be made en account of the Japanese
loan placed in this country, and whether these
will be provided for by previous purchases of
exchange or by gold shipments remain to dc
eeen. Moderate gold exports will cause no
concern, owing to easy money rates here ana
cur own abundant supplies of the precious
metal. Paris has shown less anxiety of late
In acquiring gold, the stock there having risen
to the extraordinary figure of $570,(O0.ouo.
which ought to be sufficient to provide against
all contingencies. In the foreign financial
markets there is still more or lees uncertainty
concerning the naval battle between Russia
anfl Japan, which may n*ver come off. but
the improved conditions of internal affairs In
Russia are having a favorable effect and large
ly modify previous distrust of Russian
finances. ' j, \u25a0' - *; -"
"Our foreign trade is exceedingly heavy,
having again touched hlghwater mark. April
merchandise exports reached $129,000,000. or
t2o.tKto.ooo more than last year. Imports In
the same month were $95,500,000. or $12,000,000
greater than last year. The excess of exports
Â«as $53,750,000 In April."

"I was born in Putnam County, New
York," paid Miss Crosby, "and, would you
think it. I was 45 years old when I wrote
my first hymn. Previous to that I had
written some poetry, but when I started
to write hymns the work seemed to come
natural to me. That may be because I
loved it. My whole heart was centered
in writing true and beautiful lines.
"The hymn I hold fondest is 'Safe in the
Arms of Jesus.' I wrote it in IS6S in fif
teen minutes, and I have always taken
a llttie pride in this" fact. â¢ W. H. Doane,
who had written the music for several of
my hymns, came to me one morning and
said he had come music for which he
wanted words. He added that lie had
just forty minutes to catch. a train for
Cincinnati, and he asked me< to evolve
the lines in less than that time. He sat
down at the piano and played the' music.
1 eat thiklng deeply for a few minutes
after be bad stopped, then said, 'I- think
I can write it.' I hurried upstairs,, and
in a quarter of an hour came down with
thb stanzas as they are .sung to-day. : I
believe the hymn was dictated by the
spirit of the Lord... lt is a splendid mis
sion hymn, and it has brought comfort to
tens of thousands. What a blessing it Is
to me have written it, I have written
more than 6000 hymns, but 'Safe in the
Arms of Jesus' is my favorite "of aIL"- :.
The Methodists of the United States will
honor Miss Crosby by celebrations and
by calling her next birthday "Fanny
Crosby day." Services will be held Â£in
churches throughout the country; N and it
is likely that the Methodists of Canada
and the British ' Isles will join in this
tribute.â Hartford Times.
Miss Crosby is one of the most remark
able women in the world. She has writ
ten more than 6000 hymns, some oÂ£ which
have been translated into all the tongues
of Europe. Even now, with her sight
gone, she engages in her favorite work,
and regularly goes on long trips, lecturing
in missions and giving her time and
money to promoting. charities. Last week
she lectured in several distant points in
New Jersey and early in the month she
finished a three weeks' tour in Massa
chusetts.

he was about tha Grand Hctel.. apparently In
the best of spirits. He suffered little by his

: Dr. Bauer, believes that there "is a
system". of ; magnetic or electric force
below the earth's surface; which isact
ing to demagnetize the earth and at the
same time to cause the north magentic
pole -to <.mqve to the west; and south,
while ..there"; is also a similar system
above \the7 earth's surface which -.also
exerts 'an Important effect on. the' sec
ular ' variation^' - From this - study ; it Is
deduced' that the earth's magnetic mo
ment-is, shrinking at' me irate of
1-2400 â¢ part â¢ annually; and that in the
course : of 1600 years it?- will have but
one-half its present value: Y - -. :r- - '

Policeman Luke Livingston testified
that he was ia charge .of the booth
from about 1 till 6. p.~m. Hazell. he
said, was challenging the votes of men
because they were '\u25a0. paupers, and 1 Liv
ingston, had tq>tell^hlm he must stop
challenging that .way; if not witness
would "put him out. Hazell persisted,
and witness put 'him out of the booth.
Livingston.. had to be checked by the
Judge several times and told to pay at
tention r to the questions asked and an
ewer them properly. It was not neces- 1
eary for witness to expound the law as
he knew it. Policeman George H. Gra
ham, who was relieved at the booth by
Livingston, testified to a number of
challenges being made and the refusal j
cf defendant to administer the oath.
Witnesses were examined as to de
fendant's character, including Ferdi-;
nand Falck, James B. Cowden, Abel
Hosmer, Edward S. Batten and Detec
tive Sergeant William Armstrong. Jo
seph I. Drucker, one of the grand ju-.
rors that Indicted Rebstock, was . also;
examined. Fred Hancock. -who test!-'
fied on Monday.' was- to be recalled, but :
che of the defendant's attorneys said,
he was indisposed. .;
Attorney Abe Ruef was the star wit
ness for the defense at the trial of Jo
seph Rebstock, .indicted for violation of
the , election , law. in Judge Lawlor's
cour.t . yesterday! His appearance
caused smiles. to suffuse the faces of
the defendant and his attorneys, but his
evidence was not of any .importance.
He testified that 'he reached the
Almshouse booth. about 2 p. m. on' tfte
day of the primary election and was
met outside the booth by the defendant,
who complained to him that TV. H. Ha
zell was putting challenges to all the
voters and' obstructing- the election.
Witness .spoke' to Hazell. who explained
that Jje was putting the question to the
voters -If It was their Intention to vote
tor Roosevelt and Fairbanks at the
general , election. Witness told Hazell
that he had no right to.- make a chal
lenge on that ground.' and Hazell
6howed him a section of the code which
â¢ustained Hazell's'*' 'position. Witness
had drawn up. the law himself, but' had
overlooked that part of the section.
Then, he, told Rebstoclt to accept the
challenges and administer the oath.
Rebstock replied that he would follow
the suggestion, and witness left the
booth. â¢
Smith . did * not epend a pleasant | day
yesterday at the County Jail on Broad
way. He awoke in the morning complain
ing of being very ill. â¢ At his request he
was visited by Dr. E. G. McConnell. The
physician said Smith was suffering se
verely from an internal j complaint. The
da fault er will probably .be removed to
Folsom next Saturday \u25a0 afternoon.
A deed was placed on record yesterday
showing the conveyance bY Edward J.
Smith and Margaret Smith, his wife, of
the family residence on Fair Oaks street,
near Twenty-fifth, to his brother, James
B. Smith. The indenture is made on May
24, 1904, and the consideration .mentioned
in the document is $10. A peculiarity of
the deed -is that it is not signed by
Smith's wife, and the transfer may be
void bn that account. John R. Smith
signed the deed as ! witness and the ac
knowledgment was made before Charles
Edelman, notary public, on the date men
tioned. The deed .was recorded at the
request 'of Archibald. Barnard, one of
Smith's attorneys. -.The property was at
tached 'by the City Attorney as > soon as
Smith's defalcation became known.'
Smith j is supposed- to have received a
commission from the bankers for. the use
of the fundsiof the city, which were in
vested to earn dividends for private
firms. According to the current rumors
Smith let the bankers ' have enormous
sums at one time and took desperate
chances in order to earn his commissions.
The Grand Jury Is still working on the
theory that Edward J. Smith, the self
confessed defaulting; Tax Collector, of this
city, was aided and abetted in . his steal
ings by others. The members of the in-,
qulsitorial body are not yet ready to pre
sent the facts, as they are none too sure
of their ground, but It is likely that ef
forts .will be made to establish a conf
spiracy. when the jurors meet again in a
few days. . _
A story Is going: the rounds to the ef
fect that Smith was in league with sev
eral well-known bankers of this city, who
also', juggled ..with the, .funds of the tax
office. It is said Smith was in the habit
of loaning money to these bankers, which
they invested at" short" notice and repaid
when the deals were put through suc
cessfully.

Woodward filed a report .of the plans
for the ; paving of Fourth .street from
Howard to . Townsend at ' an estimated
cost-of J54.200, the balance leftin the
fund of â¢ 575,000, to improve the' street
from' Market to Channel. â¢ The paving
has been delayed in order to build a
sewer from \u25ba' Howard to Channel, for
which funds â¢ are available \u25a0 under the
bond : issue. The balance . of $54,200
cannot be used after June 30 next and
will revert to- the surplus fund. A pro
posed new appropriation of $10,000 will
be sufficient 'only to restore the pave
ment so the improvement as originally
planned may not be- carried out fora
year .to /come. â¢ The board \u25a0 adopted the
specifications ; and - asked \ the ' Supervis
ors for 'authority to do the -work, de
spite ? the * existing â¢ complications.
The board directed the City Engin
eer to' submit plans ! and :; specifications
for the conversion, of the* Geary- street
road -into a municipal , electric - system,
for, which r J330.000 will .be Tappropriat
ed.' The plans. will; be' sent to the Su
pervisors this afternoon.
The Board of Works yesterday took
the Board- of Supervisors" to task for
refusing- to provide funds for the prep
aration of "plans for street Improve
ments under the bond I3sue. City ' En
gineer Woodward stated that it would
be impossible . for his office to do any
more work under the bond Issue with
out neglecting the .current work.
Woodward said he would be unable to
prepare plans for sewers In Mission
street from Second to the bay and in
Fourth street from Howard to Chan
nel and for the paving- and widening- or
Mission street from the bay to Ninth.
The board was wroth at the neglect
of the' Supervisors to comply with the
request of r the City Engineer for addi
tional help. '
