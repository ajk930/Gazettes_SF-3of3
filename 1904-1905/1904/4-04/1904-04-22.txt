The road is an unfrequented one,
Keveral miles from .town, and had it
not been for the prompt action' of
Mrs. Lennox the doctor might have
suffered for hour*:, . .
- ~ "If 'they , were' instructed." he said,
"by their* own conventions, they will
act .^accordingly. If: they are. unin
structed they will r vote according to
their ;will and the- national con
tention will \ not .for a /moment give
consideration to -to-day's convention."
The reading of this report was the
signal {for another -uproar. . The ques
tion then came up on the I substitution
of the' minority report of the com
mittee for : the majority report. A
heated debate fallowed. Delegate Cun
ningham of Somerville Â¦ declaring that
if the Hearst delegates were. not given
a "fair show" they would form a new
party. \ . . . , ' - '
5 A^ vote on a substitution resulted in
an overwhelming victory for the Olney
forces, the -motion - to - substitute being
lost. â¢ . . Â¦
; , At this point, the committee on bal
iots' reported the : result of the voting
for the â¢ delegates . at large. .
After 'adjournment George Fret! Wil

said that' the action' of the convention
in adopting * the" unit " rule was a rank*
absurdity from ..beginning .to end-" and
that the district delegates would . pay
no attention to â¢ to-day's -rule. : ';

When the committee" on ballots re
tired the chairman of the committee
on resolutions presented the majority
report ]ot his . committee. . These reso
lutions' favored the candidacy of Olney
for President and instructed the entire
State delegation for him.
It was during the reading of these
resolutions that the convention; reach
ed the climax. of its turbulence. ThÂ«Â»
first mention of the name of Olney
evoked prolonged applause, but when
the . motion for adoption of the unit
rule . was made there was .- an uproar.
Shouts of "No, no" from the Hearst
delegates rang through the hall and
cries of. "It's an outrage" could be
distinguished in the 'general noise and
confusion. . ". . â¢
.When this demonstration had sub
sided, the^ minority "report _ was read,
indorsing Hearst as the Democratic
nominee.
. The proceedings of r the ._ convention
were marked at times by scenes of the
greatest turbulence.
The platform adopted consisted of a
single plank, an indorsement of Olney,
and instructs the delegates to vote as
a- unit for him. .'
TJPKOAR IX COXVENTIOy.
BOSTON, April 21.â By an over
whelming vote the Massachusetts
Democratic Convention in Xremont
Temple instructed four delegates at
large and twenty delegates from the
various Congressional , districts of the
State to support. Richard Olney of this
city for the Presidential nomination at
the i Democratic National Convention
next July.
Four delegates at large pledged to
the support of Olney were- elected, and
the Hearst supporters were defeated
by a vote of about 600 to 200. A reso
lution indorsing Hearst was voted down
by a. large majority.
The following were elected delegates
at large: "William A. Gaston, Mayor
Patrick A. Collins, William L. Doug
lass and Congressman. John It. Thayer.
George Fred Williams, leader of the
factic-n of the Massachusetts Democ
racy supporting Hearst's candidacy,
made a. vigorous 'protest, against tha
adoption" of the "unit rule, but the con
vention, by a vote of nearly 3 to 1,
refused to strike from the platform the
clause "calling for unanimous action
with . reference to ..Presidential nomi
nees, " and after adopting the ; resolu
tions presented by the ' majority of its
/committee s voted, on^rndtion -of Mayor
Josiah Quincy," that the unit rule gov
ern not only the support of Olney but
also all 'matters -pertaining to the con
vention. '
Meanwhile Mrs. Lennox ran to a
neighboring house for assistance. Re
turning on the run with R. A- Em
mett, she found the doctor's strength
had left him with the limb; but half
cut through. The buffering; man
begged. th*. two to complete the work.
The man hesitated. Mrs. Lennox quick
ly look the knife, cut through the re
maining tendons and then bound the
Mound with her silk muffler. By this
lime Dr. Matson was unconscious,. but

to the Emmett house," where he'is how

â¢ NEWCHWANG, Aprir 21.â An order
issued by the Russian military authori
ties, through the commissioner of cus
toms here, notifying the pilots of New
chwang that pilot who gave as
sistance to any Japanese; s,hlp in the
waters leading to Newchwang would
be held responsible to the full extent
of martial law, was made a subject of
inquiry by three of .the foreign Consuls
here with regard to the exact meaning
of the words "full extent of martial
law." ."' i/i'h?.
To these' inquiries the Russian an
thorities replied -that' the assisting of
Japanese ships In the waters mentioned
would subject the offending, pilots to
the same treatment given Russian sub
jects and traitors, based upon the. fact
that the Russian authorities had de
clared Newchwang to be under mar
tial law. Â»
In their reply to' the clnsuls the
authorities affirmed, .further, that, on
the other hand," pilots c,quld be com
pelledto pilot Russian r vessels or forced
to leave ! Newchwang. '",;'
The -Russian ; authorities hold , that
under "the -existing martial law for
eigners are upon the same status as
Russian subjects, but the foreign Con
suls- aver, that foreign -"residents of
Newchwang who might "assist the Jap
anese { can 1 , be \ held responsible for the
acts "only as rbelllgerents and cannot
be regarded as Russian subjects. Â¦

Russia has made a new issue of $15,
000,000 in paper currency against free
gold in the state bank. At the Minis
try of Finance it was explained that
it was an ordinary issue and In no
sense was forced. Under the law pa
per is issuable to double the amount
of gold up to $150,000,000 gold, in ex
cess of which paper issued must be
covered, ruble for ruble. In the'state
bank there are, in round figures,
5400,000,00.0, in gold, which would
permit of an issue of $550,000,000 in
paper, but the paper issue at present
amounts to only $350,000,000.
All sorts of figures of the cost of
the war are printed abroad. , The press
is . authoritatively Informed that the
daily . expenses are averaging $750,000,
and it is estimated that a year's ex
penditures for the war will total $250,
000.000. . Â¦ rv<
To meet this there existed a free
balance of $50,000,000, . which. - was .In
creased t,o $115,000,000 by reductions in
the ordinary budgets, 'leaving ostensi
bly $135,000,000 to be found. But a por

Foreign Minister Lamsdorff has been
notified that the United States reserves
all the rights she may have under in
ternational law in the event of any
American citizens being affected by
Russia's decision in the case of war
correspondents using wireless teleg
raphy. This notification does not in
volve a protest against Russia's
course; it is simply reserving what
ever rights may exist in regard to' the
yet unadjudicated question of the use
of wireless telegraphy in time'of war.
United States Commercial Agent
Greener at' Vladivostok has been in
structed, through Embassador .Me-
Cormick, to inform the Japane.se Con
sul at the island of Saghalien that a
vessel will be sent to the island to
take back to Japan the consulate staff
and the refugees. The arrangements
for sending the ship have been made
by Japan through the authorities in
Washington.
Grand Duke Cyril, who was Injured
at the time of the Petropavlovsk dis

seph A. Smith. Worcester.
The balloting consumed more than' an
hour. When the votes were counted the
following platform was presented to
the convention:
"The Democrats of Massachusetts,
in convention assembled, present to the
Democrats of the United States the
name of Richard Olney as one conspic
uously qualified for the office of Pres
ident."
After eulogizing Olney. the platform
concluded as follows:
"We hereby instruct the delegates
and alternates chosen to attend the
National Convention at St. Louis by
this convention and by the Congres
sional District conventions lo j place
in nomination the name of * Richard
Olney as the choice of Massachusetts
for the Presidency, and we further in
struct said delegates and alternates to
cast the vote of Massachusetts as a
unit for him in the convention until
the nomination shall be made or his
name shall be withdrawn by author
ity."
The first mention of the name of
Richard Olney brought forth prolonged
applause. When that portion was
reached which dealt with the "unit
rule" for governing the delegates there
was an uproar.
"No, no; it is an outrage," shouted
the members of the Hearst faction.
Delegates arose in their seats, cheers
were given for Hearst. Then the Olney
men cheered.
In an instant of quiet John A. Coul
thourst announced that he desired to
read the minority report of the com
mittee on resolutions.
The resolutions of the minority called
for the enforcement of the anti-trust
laws, for the election of a President
"who would not hesitate to 'run
amuk' so long as monopolistic combin
ations continue," for" national super
vision of national monopolies and pub
lic ownership of public utilities, and
concluded:
"The one man who thus exemplifies
these principles as expressed by him
is William" Randolph Hearst of New
York, and we therefore indorse him as
the Democratic nominee for President."
An uproar followed the final words
of the : resolutions. Several delegates
tried to secure recognition.
Finally, after several efforts, a Hearst
man succeeded In" presenting a motion
calling for the substitution of the mi
nority resolutic-ns for the majority res
olutions. This produced, a preliminary
wrangle, with a flood of angry
speeches. When the chairman at
length was able to do so the motion
was put, and by a rising vote the sub

majority report was lost. . ,

CAPTAIN HEALY
IN THE TOILS
The testimony was of a personal
character, dealing with the convjctloh
of the witness on charges of poly
gamous cohabitation, and was dragged |
from him under protest that he be pro- !
t^cted from any peril or liability to |
prosecution for what he revealed. When
assured that his plural marriages un- !
der the statute of limitations could ;
not be used as evidence against him.
he answered most of the questions \
asked. His testimony was no less sen- |
sational than that given by President
Smith early In the investigation. Hej
answered all questions of a personal
character, but every admission was
made reluctantly, and the replies to
questions in regard to his numerous
marriages were as near monosyllables
as it was possible to make them.
The sensation of the hearing occurred
when Mr. Tayler examined Mr. Cannon
in regard to his various marriages. Mr.
Tayler asked the witness when he was
first married, and he answered:
"On Jufy 18. 1S58."
"To whom?"
"Sarah Maria Mousely."
"Who next?"
Mr. Cannon stood up and his voice
shook with great emotion as he said:
"I beg an opportunity to explain and
to ask a question of the cnalrman be
fore I proceed. Nineteen years ago I
was brought into great trouble. I was
prosecuted and sent to prison because
I acknowledged the mothers of my
children as my families. I was given
the opportunity of deserting my fami
lies or going to prison. I went to
prison.
EXPLANATION* OF CAXXOX.
""I was sent to prison for eight
months and served six, when the Su
preme Court took up my case and I
was released. While I was in prison
I said to my associates who called to
see me: 'You could not come here in
honor; I could not stay In honor." Â¦
"For a long time 1 have lived within
the law as far as it was possible to do
so in the face of obligations to my
families. I have not paraded my fami
lies, but in honest pride I have nour
ished them.
"The press of the country has car
icatured President Smith for the testi
mony he gave in regard to the plural
families, and if I am asked to make
similar exhibitions of my families I ap
peal for protection from any conse
quences that may be the result of the
testimony. I will answer all questions
in regard to myself or the church if
I am assured that I will not be placed
in peril by reason of the testimony."
Mr. Cannon sat down, quivering with
ill-suppressed emotion, and Mr. Worth
ington asked:
"Mr. Cannon, have you any coun
"No, sir."
Mr. Worlhington submitted to the
chairman that the witness should be
informed as to his rights and as to his
liability should he answer questions
which might incriminate him.
RIGHTS OF WITNESS.
Chairman Burrows said the witness
was at liberty to decline to answer any
questions he chose, but Mr. Worthing
ton insisted that the refusal must be
based on the ground that the witness
feared to incriminate himself. The offi
cial reported then read the question:
â¢'To whom were you next married?"
"Anna Amanda Mousely."
"When were you married to her?"
asked Mr. Tayler.
"At the same hour that I was mar
ried to Sarah Maria Mousely."
"By the same ceremony?"
"Yes."
"To whom were you next married?"
"Mrs. Clara Mason, in 1875," replied
Mr. Cannon, also saying he was mar
ried to Martha Hughes in 1SS4,' and
Maria Banning in 1886. Johanna C.
Donnellson in 1886, and that he had
not been married since that time. All
his wives were living. He said that
they all lived In Salt Lake County, but
in separate houses; that he had fam
ilies by five of his wives.
, "Do you live with all of your -wives
now?" Mr. Tayler asked.
â¢'I am sorry to say that I do not."
"Why? Because you are now In
Washington and cannot be living with
them?"
"No; because of an agreement 'made
by the church which compels me to be
as modest as I can. I have only been
as attentive as I felt common human
ity required" me to be."
"What do you mean by that?" -
"I mean that this church order has
made me more cold In treatment of
thtm than I should be."
REGRET FOll DISCLOSURES. "^
Witness related the -proceedings at
the recent conference at Salt Lake at
which President Smith; had been sup
ported for the testimony he had given
at Washington. When asked if the peo
ple had censured the president of the
church for his testimony, he said he
bad heard of ' no criticism, but that
they regretted the circumstances which
made such disclosures necessary.

CALL BUREAU. HOTEL BARTON,
WASHINGTON, April 21.â "It is said
that a cantilever crane and i*her
heavy equipment will be neces
sary before we may begin the work of
building our big collier for the navy
at Mare Island yard, but I have to say
that it is not true," said Senator Per
kins to-day.
"These tools become necessary in
course of the construction, to be sure,
but they are not wanted for a long
time. By the time they are -wanted
they may be in place, but the fact is
the work on the ship may be 'begun at
once, and so If will be. I consider this
act one of the most important of the
present session for the Pacific Coast.
At Mare Island there is a big colony
of highly skilled mechanics, who are
residents of Vallejo. Lately the work
in the navy yards has been slack, and
this movement is intended to give them
steady employment."
Representative Bell, who first pro
posed the measure in the. House, is
highly pleased at his success. "Work
can be done as well and more cheaply
in a navy yard than by private con
cern," he said, to-day., "This move
ment will develop into a policy of the
Government and we will arrange for
battleships being built at Mare Island.
It will, afford Government protection
against the exactions of private con
cern's and will demonstrate Just how
cheaply this work may be done, so
that the Government will not be at the
mercy of contracting shipbuilders. It
will necessitate equipping and strength
ening the navv yards, but that is a
thing to be decided In any case."
Special Dispatch to The Call
The bill was vigorously opposed by-
Harrison of New York, who character
ized it as despotism run mad, because
it gave the President authority greater
than any sovereign in the world. He
emphatically remarked that members
ought to be grateful "that the Presi
dent had consented to consult x the
House instead of legislating from the
White House as he is accustomed to
Â«io." He thought that on the eve of a
Presidential election' this autocratic
power "would throw open to him six
or seven hundred offices."
The canal zone bill was passed unan
imously.
A resolution was agreed to request
ing the President to renew negotia
tions with governments where discrim
ination is mad? against Jewish citi
zens Â°f Ihe United States with th<?
view of securing equal freedom "of
travel and sojourn with all other citi
zens.
The bill to provide for a temporary
government of the canal zone at Pan
ama and for the protection of the canal
works was taken up. The substitute
for the Kittredge bill was considered.
A damson of Georgia. Stevens of Min
nesota and Richardson of Alabama,
members of the Committee on Inter
state and Foreign Commerce, which
unanimously reported the substitute,
urged its passage, contending that it
was word for word similar to what
-Jcffereon had suggested and approved
for the government of the Territory of
lxiulsiana.
A rule was adopted, after the Demo
crats had forced a roll call, for the
consideration at any time of W\h bill

WASHINGTON, April 21.â The House
to-day gave evidence of approaching
aJjournmen: by passing a large num
ber of bills, among them being one to
provide a temporary government for
the Panama canal zone.
There was a controversy between Al
drich and Gorman, the latter charging
the Republicans with a determination
to force an early adjournment for po
litical purposes and Aldrich asserting
that Gorman could discuss public ques
tions as long as he chose.
McCumber expressed the opinion that
the time "was approaching for the en
actment of a general service pension
law. In this connection he referred to
previous service pension laws, and in
cidentally mentioned the fact that
there were still living about 600 sons
and daughters of soldiers of the revo
lutionary war.
McCumber also discussed the recerit
executive pension order, contending
that it was in harmony with the laws
making pensioners dependent upon
physical disability.
When the emergency river and har
bor appropriation bill was taken up,
Gorman asked why no general river
and harbor bill was to be, passed at the
present session. Mr. Elkins, in charge
of the bill, replied that the judgment
of the Committee on Commerce, which
had reported the bill, had been that a
general bill could not be passed and
that the state of the Treasury and pub
lic business would not Justify such a
measure.
WASHINGTON, April 21.â The pen
sion appropriation bin, carrying an ap
propriation of more than $137,000,000,
and. the emergency river and harbor
appropriation bill, which carries $3,000.
000, were passed to-day by the Senate,
leaving only the general deficiency and
the military academy bills, of the en
tire list of supply measures still to be
considered by the Senate. While the
river and Harbor measure was under
consideration Gorman sharply criticized
the failure to bring In% a general river
and harbor bill.

Mary "Worth, nineteen years of age

here to tread the rosy paths which,
she understood, awaited unsophisti

Edward Clifford alias "Toughy."
who for half a dozen years has held

sentenced to-day for vagrancy and dis
turbing the peace. With him on Judge
Mogan's calendar is Ruth Clifford, a
flashily attired danseuse. who also dis
turbed the peace and will be punished
for it. Clifford accosted her on the
street with a request that she give
him $8. which she declined to do, so he
struck her and she struck back. Then
they clinched and fell and were
thumping each other right merrily
when a policeman arrived.

discreetly refrained from expressing
his feelings.
William N v olan, alias William Bray,
charged with assaulting and attempt

ago, had a hearing before Judge Mo
pan and will lie told to-day whether he
is iruilty or not. He is 18 years of age.
a native of Calaveras County and
equipped with precocious self-posses
sion. The two women positively iden
tified him as their assailant, but he
never' flinched under their scrutiny,
and when on the witness stand he loud
ly answered all questions before they
were half-uttered. S'o attempt was
made to deny the assault, but it is
doubtful that he can be held for at
tempt to rob," as the testimony of the
complainants on that noinl was rather
equivocal.
Louis Delnardi was before Judge Mo
pan on the charge of disturbing the
peace in a Broadway temple of vaude
ville, and his case was continued until
to-day to enable the prosecution to ob
tain testimony sufficient to convict. The
police have l>een in pursuit of Mr. Del
nardi ever since his offense was com
mitted, several weeks, ago, when one
of his companions. Emil Devin, was ar
rested and found guilty. At the time
the peace was disturbed a dashing sou
brette was singing "Save My Mother's
Flipper From the Sale," and it is un
derstood that Str. Delnardi's attorney
will ask for dismissal of his client on
the grpund that the sentiment of the
Kong was irreverent vnd unfilial. the
vocalism defective and the perform
ance penerally provocative of protest.
Among the British cttstoms which
this comparatively uncivilized "land of
ours has resolutely declined to adopt
is the time-honored one of transform
ing a theater into a bedlam when the
rxrforma nee fails to please. In good
old Lunnon oven the most genteel audi
-ence expresses disapproval of nn act or
en aovor by moaning "Boo" and pelting
the. stage- with orange peel, nutshells
and other convenient missiles, but the
most nifcld of this country's Angloma
niars who has not entirely relinquished
claim to respectability would never de-
S'.-end to. 6uch rowdyism as that. He
would either exit quietly or remain and
suffer in silence, because he knows that,
any other course would invite arrest
for disturbing the peace and attach to
his character the taint of hoodlumtsm.
Its as hoodlums such offenders are
treated by the Police Judges.
Two of them. John Fraser and Kddie
Ferris, were sentenced to twenty-four
hours' imprisonment yesterday by
Judge Fritz, and at the end of that pe
viod they are iÂ« reappear for additional
punishment if it ran legally he ordered.
They endeavored to make "rough
hcufe." as the prosecuting policeman
termed it, in a Market street home of
melodrama, and their behavior was so
offensive to the less* exacting folk in
the audience that their arrest was ef
fected in the interest of law and order.
It vas the way in which the villain of
the Tlay maltreated the heroine that
ptirred urÂ» their latent rowdyism, they
declared in defense, but the Judge
scouted the plea on the ground that
the hero was amply able to protect the
lady.
For stealing a canary Fred Pierce,
a respectable looking man, will be ex
amined to-day by Judge Mogan. The

coat, where it was almost smothered
when rescued.

William Casey was dismissed on the
charge of murder by Judge Cabaniss,
who declared that the prosecuting tes
timony alone sufficed to warrant that
decision. It was clearly proved that
when Casey shot William McNamee in
the former's grocery, on Bernal
Heights, he acted purely in self-de
fense. The Coroner's Jury returned a
verdict of justifiable homicide, and
Judge Cabaniss heard only one witness
for the defense. McNamee was killed
the night of Saturday, April 9.
Holmgren was "doing" Dupont street
one evening not long ago, and in the
course ut his "peregrinations he ub
sorbed considerable liquor. "During a.
lucid interval he deposited for safe
keeping with a' saloon-keeping friend
of his an indorsed check for $60 and
cash to the amount of $20, and then
he resumed his tour of inspection. It
was Madge Wells' unlucky star that
guided him into her company, for soon
afterward she was arrested for steal
ing from him the money which he had
deposited as afore described. After the
arrest the saloon man who he.ld the
cash and check was heard from, and
Gus was as much surprised as pleased
to learn that his wealth had not been
lost.
He apologized to Madge for his alco
holic lapse of memory.
Complete vindication was awarded to
Madge Wells by Judge Cabaniss, and
at the same tima and by the fcame
authority Gus Holmgren, an East
street dealer in -cigars, was given to
understand that he had acted with
undue precipitancy in getting the wo
man arrested and. charged with grand
larceny. . .._
Ethel Somers became disgruntled be

sought in strong waters she waxed

victed of vagrancy and awaiting sen

Kicc-las von ftuben, a meek little man
with scraggly mustache or *andy hue.
told of his misplaced confidence in. the
intetrrity of Llllie Baker, middle aged,
corpulent and aggressive of manner,
and Jjudge Fritz patiently listened to
the pathetic recital. But its pathos
was lost upon the woman, who chuc
kled silently and pressed her sides,- a
la Jack Falstaff, as the man confessed
the truthfulness that had been so sys
tematically preyed upon.
Their first meeting was in a Pa
oific-street resort ftrr seafaring men,
Herr von Ruben said, and he was im
pressed by the lady's ample physical
charms and demurencss of demeanor.
She told him she was a poor, lone" spins
ter, with no one to cherish or protect
her, and gazing at his diminutive figure
she sighed and said how happy is the
lot- of a woman who nas a strong
masculine arm to lean upon. Then she
artlessly remarked that she had in her
mind's eye a business opportunity
which a man with ordinary pecuniary
means could utilize to advantage. That
was the beginning of a course of chi
canery by which Mr. von Ruben says
he was wheedled out of about $1100.
The money was obtained for the osten
sible purpose of establishing the de
fendant in the saloon business, and
$300 of it was to be Invested in the
purchase of a piano? - After his money
Mas gone the complainant ascertained
that he had been taken in and done

sobriquet of "the Queen of Pacific

BKLL FILES 'ANSWER.
DENVER, April 2i:â Defying the de
tachment of' cavalry which brought
Charles H.Moyer from Tel Iuride to ap
.pear before the. Supreme CJourt, W, D,
Haywpod, eecretary-treasurer of the
Federation . of Miners," attempted s to
hold â¢ a conversation with the prisoner
whiie he was being taken from the train
at the Union station thip morning. < Or
dered to stand back by Captain We^Js,
commanding the guard, Haywood
struck 'the officer in the face. ' In . a
second he was surrounded by a cordon
of angry troopers," who struck at Mm
with the, butts of their carbines and
beat h'ni withvsix-8hpotei-s. : That ;he
was ndr.killed by -the excited 'soldiery
is due, to the action of Bert Givens,
the orderly of gaptain "Wells, who
struck up the muzzle of a gun aimed
at Haywood and rescued him from his
position between two gars, where Jhe
guardsmen had him cornered. Placed
under arrest, he t was put In the middle
of a hollow square of militiamen rind
marched to the Oxford Hotel, near the
depot. Here hÂ» again showed fight and
was" beaten into submission. His Â»in
juries Qorieisted of a deep cut on the
left "side of the nead and one on the
right side of- his- head, which almost
severed the lower lobe of his right ear.
When a demand v^as made by Police
Captain Frank Lef for tne release- of
Haywpcd on the.ground that the mili
tary rule did not extend to, Denver,
General Bell replied th&t he intended
to hold Haywood' as a military pris
oner* and would shoot any one who
attempted to take him, but neverthe
less, updfr orders from Governor Pea
body, Hay wood,. was surrendered "to
Sheriff Armstrong and placed Jn the

Executive Committee Insists
That Employes Must lie
long to Union After 60 Days
Three Â«esentl&l differences exist be
twaen the Amalgamated Union of
Street Car Employes and the United
B&ilro&ds of San Francisco. They are
questions of wages, hours and the drip
ping blade of an "open shop."
Last night the executive committee
of the Carmen's Union met. Thirty
one of the representatives of the union
got la convention at 310 OTarrell
street. The call was for 7: SO o'clock,
bat stragglers prolonged the meeting
tour until it was nearly 8 o'clock be
fore a Quorum was represented. W. D.
Mahon, president of the International
Union; Richard Cornelius and other
prominent members of the union were
becomingly late, as befits Important
personages.
One by one the articles submitted by
the United Railroads were taken up
and discussed- Objections were plenti
ful to each of them, but they were
oven Idea on a vote. Only three of the
terms were left In dispute. They were
.on the question of a slicing scale, the
* hours cf work and the question of al
lowing the United Railroads to em
ploy non-union men.
In tbe flrst case the executive com
pjlttee of the Carmen's Union will rec
Â©mxneird that the company shall agree
to pay a flat rate of 27^ cents an hour.
Instead of the scale offered by the com
pany, ranging from Â£5 cent* an hour
for one-year employes to 27% cents per
hour for employes of three years'
standing.
Secondly, the demand win be made
for a day's work to be finished In 11H
hours Instead of 15, as proposed by the
United Railroads.
â¢â¢open shop" power.
Finally, and probably more important
as an issue, will be the recommenda
tion that an agreement be entered into
between employers and employes that
after eixty days' employment on the
cars a new man must submit to the
union whether or, not he is fit to per
form his duties, asd then he must be
come a union man If he shall prove ac
ceptable. This is the direct attack on
the "open shop" policy inaugurated by
the United Railroads.
When the executive committee ad
journed after a session of nearly three
hours none of tb^rn-was wflllng to dis
cuss the Issues. It was stated by Presi
dent Mahon that a general meeting of
the carmen would be held Saturday
rifRftt at the headquarters, 310 O'FarrelJ
ttreet, when a thorough discussion of i
thÂ«Â» subject will be held. The recom- 1
mendations of the executive committee '
Â¦will b* explained and the objections to
the three clauses in question will be
stated. On the following Monday a se
cret ballot by the carmen will be taken.
The ballots will contain each of the
riipputrd points and the single words
"No" and "Yes" are to be marked on
the margin. A majority vote Is to rule
on each question, and In case of one
clause failing to carry a new series of
negotiations is to be taken up with the
company.
CHAPMAN'S STATEMENT.
Apparently an entirely different view
I? entertained by the United Railroads.
T^ast night General Manager Chapman
issued th^ following statement, which
varies with the facts stated by the
rnbmbrrs of the executive committee of
the Carmen's Union:
TtiÂ»- contract now In proc^w of submission
to thÂ» union, and practicaily Â«Rre*<l upon by
thr ront>rÂ«nce committee, is identical with
thf company's proposal to th* men, with two
exception*. It Includes a new eectlon (3?),
*hirh read* a* follows:
""No employe eliall be discharged or dli>
triminaUd against by an officer or official
cf !*i' company because of membership, in
th* union.
Â¦Wh<Tf any employe has been. In the opin
ion of the union, discharged or discriminated
eg*in*t on account of union affiliation* (un
.iuftlvt Me case fhall first be taken up with
Mr. Hihbs. or his successor, and. in case of
faSlnra to roach an adjustment, the case may
I* 1 i.fi"s!'il by the union to the general man
. r.- â¢ â¢a.tvl â ort at the union's, option, to- a
fcdborjmtuitu*" of tho board of directors, con-
Fi*ting Â«rf Messrs. IJolbrook and Tobln, who
t ilt consider the came and render a de
*iÂ»ion upon written testimony presented by
Â«Â«eh party.
"In rane of the absence or illness of one. or
both, the vacancy *hall be filled by appoint
m*-m of the board of directors of the com
iwnjr."
Thin i-eci ion nu adopted to meet the ideas
of the union in rvcard to dismissals. Tb*
other change is the elimination of section 3
of the olÂ«J contract, which reads as follows:
"Shculd the peneral manager or other execu
tive officer of the company in passing on
any difference that may arise under this airree
mvnt and brought before htm by the acci e*AHfS
otleers of the union decide adversely to them
Â»:i Â»ppcal *hall lie on the part of the union
to the president or vice president and from
in-m to the board of directors of the company.
The president or vice president ahaJI hear
und pass upon appeal* at least once a, month.
The time -Tor saJd hearings shall in every case
precede the rejrular meetings of the board of
dinectors at lea*t one week; and at each of
paid hearings all appeal made to the pre-<
dent or vice presidentxprlor thereto shall be
determined so that any appeai therefrom may
be considered at the next succeeding meeting
of the board of directors."
In other respects the result is In full ac
cord with the company's proposal, with which
the public Is already familiar. As has been
already stated In the company's proposal the
*rale tendered by It will operate to Increase
the pÂ«y of a majority of tbe men. Home Im

Since that time he haa been closely
connected with the development of the
Pacific Coast. He was born in Ded
ham, Mass., where In his early- youth
he chose for his life's business journal
ism. It was not long until he was one
of the foremost journalists of the East,
and he has always given the benefit of
his experience to younger men of the
profession.
Mr. Ewer discovered and brought
to the front the Hon. Henry Wilson,
the "Natick Cobbler" of Presidential
fame, and It was through Ewer's in-
Eight and persistence that the peerless
oratory of John B. Gough was devel
oped.

Dennett has been in Oakland about
ten days, but Is unable to give a con
nected statement of his movement's or
how he came to be here. He says that
his son George is about to open a res
taurant in Los Angeles and that he is
to help him. He says that he. made
about $1,000,000 out of the restaurant
business, but. has lost it all and that,
it is believed, has turned his head.
Dennett lost a large fortune in en
terprises of various kinds, after accu
mulating a competency out of the res
taurant business. Debts finally over
whelmed Dennett and he made a vol
untary ' petition in bankruptcy about
two years ago, his . liabilities running
into $200,000. His effort to start a "Den
nett" restaurant in Oakland shortly af
terward failed .because of antagonisms
with labor unions. ; In Philadelphia and
New York the Dennett restaurants had
quite a vogue. He was the pioneer in
this class of eating-houses on the Paci

Tighe had pleaded guilty in the mid
dle of the trial, but not before his guilt
had been made. quite apparent by the
testimony of United States Secret Ser
vice Agents George W. Hazen, Thomas
B. Foster and Thomas R. McRIanus.
When the /prisoners were asked by
the court whether they had anything
to say why sentence should not be pro
nounced upon them. Tighe said: "I
was a .victim of circumstances, your
Honor.' I was inebriated at the time
and I did not "realize what' I was do
ing. I would like to get as light a
sentence as -possible â a County Jail

THREE YEARS' SENTENCE
FOR COUNTERFEITERS
The estrangement of the men was oc
casioned by the revocation by Mrs.
Havens of her first will, in 'which she
pave her interests in the Goewey Es
tate Company to her brothers. Under
the new will she left all to her infant
son. born a few days prior to ter death.
The brothers claim that their sister
was incompetent to make a will upon
her deathbed and that she was unduly
influenced. As a result two wills have
been filed with the court. Havens then
made a move and was appointed spe
cial administrator of the estate of his
wife, but has been unable up to the
present time to find out of what her
cetate consists, owing to the refusal of
the Goeweys to give him any infor
mation upon the subject. He is now
attempting to get them into court and
make them give an accounting.
The brothers on their side have levied
an assessment of $10 a share on the
stock of the company and have ad
vertised 200 shares of their sister's es
tate for sale as delinquent. Havens
says that he is unable to ascertain
what the assessment is for or whether
it is legally levied and that James M.
Goewey, as secretary of the company,
is keeping away from the office until
after April 26. which is the date the
Flock is to be sold.
As an outcome of the strained rela
tions between John TV. Havens of
Berkeley and his brothers-in-law,
Charles H-. Herbert S. and James
M. Goewey of San Francisco, Havens
has filed a charge against his re
lations of conspiring to levy a
fraudulent assessment upon the share
of the late Gertrude Goewey Havens
In the Goewey Estate Company
end has asked that a citation
be Issued ordering the brothers
Into court to etate the character and
amount of their late sister's share in
the company. Havens says further
that James M. Goewey, as secretary of
the company, is keeping away from the
offices of the corporation at 406 Sut
ter street, San Francisco, in order to
evade the (service of the court's order.

In an attempt to save the walnut
crops from the ravages of the dread
disease known as the black blight the
Walnut Growers* Association has just
appropriated $3000 for experimentation
by the scientists of the agricultural
department of the University of Cali
fornia. With this money the scien
tists expect to accomplish such results
as will save the growers from the large
annual loss they have suffered ever
since the blight struck the trees of
California
' The walnut blight is not new. It is
present wherever walnut groves exist.
A war has been waged upon it for sev
eral years by Newton B. Pierce of the
United States Department of Agricul
ture, who has devoted much of his time
to an attempt to eradicate the pest.
The blight manifests itself by dis
coloring the leaves and limbs of the
trees and destroying the shell. The
principal loss comes through the de
struction of the shell, which leaves Ihe
meat of the nut exposed and thus re
duces the chances of the grower "for
selling it. The meat remains palatable,
but the appearance of the shell indi
cates *bat the contents are decayed so
that the growers are compelled to
throw to waste a large portion of the
crop thty cannot sell each year.

In view of the general interest tak
en in the collection of works of art
by California artists at the Mark Hop
kins Institute the board of directors
of the Art Association has decided to
keep the exhibition open to the public
free of charge until Wednesday. It is
understood that this privilege refers
to the Mary Frances Searles gallery
only.
At' 8:20 the annual concert was giv
en under the direction of Henry Hey
man and each number was heartily
applauded. The following is the pro
gramme carried out:

Â¦ At the conclusion of the musical
programme an informal reception was
held and general discussion of the va
rious paintings indulged in. -The con
sensus .of opinion, was to the effect
that many of the artists displayed
marked .improvement over previous
efforts and that the association has a
brilliant future in store.
Though ' the weather was far from
pleasant last night the forty-ninth an
nual, and spring exhibition of the San
Francisco 5 Art Association at the
Mark Hopkins Institute was pro
nounced .a thorough success by the
165 patrons who attended.
As is customary with the , associa
tion, the early portion' of the evening
was devoted to viewing? the exhibits.
This year the average number of
works were hung and those, added to
the exhibits always in the galleries,
furnished ample pleasure for the lov

torney, .Wheeler, "that;, the ; witness has
in his possession a series of anonymous
y 1 mentioned Senator C. N. Kelton yesterday
and said Â¦ that I consulted him before I sent
for Hyde. Now I recall that 1 talked with
the Senator about certain -anonymous letters
that had been sent to me. These letters had
referred to Benson's Indictment. , Hence the
interview with Hyde must have taken place
late in December last, after that indictment
had been reported In the â¢ newspapers. < Â¦Â¦:
On Senator Felton's Â¦Â¦ advice 1 read : one of
the anonymous tetters to Hyde during that In
terview, telling him at the, same time that -I
did not' want him to think I was taking ad
vantage of the : difficulties confronting: him to
press for. payment, od that the : anonymous let
ter had anything to do with ray demand. Â¦ '
. I also omitted his statement, made during
the December interview in my oface. that he
intended seeing Benson for an accounting of
profits in the Aztec transaction. He then said
he would retain me to bring that action but
I declined to take a case cither against Benson
or for him. \ ..Â¦Â¦'.' \ ,
I paid yesterday that Hyde's first promise to
me of compensation in the Aztec land matter
was at our interview in my office In December
1903. I My recollection was at fault. ' When | I
informed him In February of that year that I
would no longer act as his attorney he said I
was entitled to compensation Â¦ for that service.
On returning to the, witness stand
Dimond corrected his testimony of the
day before, saying:
SURPRISE FOR HEXEY.
It is evident that the Hyde-Benson-
Dimond land fraud case Is going to be
one of the most celebrated criminal ac
tions in the legal history of the coun
try, and one of its most difficult mys
teries will be the question, "Who wrote
the anonymous letters?" .
These facts were^ not public property
when the letters 'were written. The
writer of them, as will be seen when
they are read below, had a precise and
extensive knowledge of Hyde's meth
ods and business relations, of his deal
ings with his agents, of his failure to
make good his defective titles at Di
mond's demand and of the Interior De
partment's investigation of the land
frauds. It is in evidence that Hyde
had- learned of the investigation
through corrupted agents of the land
office, and his letters to Dimond showed
that he had communicated this infor
mation to Dimond. But it was infor
mation the alleged conspirators had
every reason to conceal and were try
ing to conceal. It is said that Dimond.
Hyde and Benson alone knew many of
the things in these letters, and as. they
were written against Hyde and Benson
â chiefly against Hyde â the writer,
says Heney, was undoubtedly Dimond.
Dimond's testimony shows a series of
mistakes in names and facts. Hyde's
stenographer, Susan Dickinson, was
called "Anne Dickinson." Colonel Za
briskie, the Tucson agent of the Gov
ernment, was misnamed "Brohaski."
The Government's detective, Steece,
was referred to as "Mr. Stace." Every
one of these errors committed by Di
mond is found in the anonymous let
ters, written to the Secretary at Wash
ington last year.
"If Dimond did not write the letters^"
asked Heney yesterday, "who could
have written them? Their author must
have been some one possessing this
exact Information about Hyde's acts.
Who except Dimond could have had
this information and made "the same
mistakes we have Â¦ heard him make
here in this courtroom?"
dence is said to be in reserve, but the
outlines of the Federal position are
now clear.. Dimond's knowledge of
Hyde's irregularities was so exactly de
fined on cross-examination for the pur
pose of identifying the defendant with
these anonymous letters, which Heney
was carefully keeping back and which
had not been mentioned in the court
room until yesterday. The prosecution
questioned Dimond until he admitted
his acquaintance with all the facts set
forth in these letters.
Dimond himself, with thorough self- {
possession and intense emphasis, said
| "No"; and his attorney, Charles S.
Wheeler, declared his faith in his j
client's Innocence and his belief that
the ' letters were the work of the Gov
ernment's detectives. But the Govern
ment, appearing by Counsel Heney, af
ter denying Wheeler's charge, said,
"Yes. Dimond wrote all these letters;"
and forthwith it began the introduction
of a mass of evidence. t .
A DAY' OF SURPRISES.
Yesterday's work marks a crisis in
the case. Heney's cross-examination
of Dimond had begun on Tuesday and
two days had been spent in going over
all the relations between Dimond and
Hyde. Including their correspondence
when Dimond was In Washington pros
ecuting Hyde's lieu land selections be
fore the General Land Office and their
quarrel over Hyde's peculiar methods
and still more over his failure to di
vide the profits with the attorney. It
was tedious work, but Â¦well done, and
as it drew to its close the Government
lawyer declared that the defendant had"
trapped himself into the hands of the
prosecutioiu
In his or*al testimony and by the cor
respondence offered by him with every
mark of candor, Dimond has shown his
familiarity with Hyde's methodsâ the
alleged frauds that form the basis of '
the Government's charge apalnst Hyae,
Benson et al. Heney took pains to
have the witness define the bounds of
his acquaintance with these peculiar
methods â the use' of irresponsible per
sons in obtaining school lands from the
States of California and Oregon, the
manufacture of legal papers and the
employment of fictitious names in ap
plications to the Government for forest
reserve selections. All the documents
in Dimond's hands were taken posses
sion of by the Governmentâ that is all
the documents that Dimond said he had
â and these were used to aid in fix
ing the extent of his acquaintance with
the alleged. title factory in Hyde's of
fice.
But yesterday Dimond unexpectedly,
announced that he had some more doc
umentsâpapers not Included in the
bundles he had formerly turned over to
Heney with the declaration that he was
concealing nothing. He produced two
of a series of anonymous letters, which
he said he received last year. Then
came the admission that these letters
had been concealed even from* his own
counsel until a day or two ago. Their
appearance on >the ! opening of. court
was afterward explained by the Gov
ernment's representatives as due to a
"leak" â a court official intrusted with
a secret . had been indiscreet, arid .Di
mond's attorneys had discovered that
Heney was planning to make the
anonymous letters a leading feature of
the case against their client. Hence
Heney found himself forestalled yes
terday morning when Dimond volun
teered the story of the letters, and his
counsel, Wheeler, at once charged Wil
liam J. Burns, the well-known detec
tive, with 5 their authorship.
These anonymous letters add to the
already complicated case one of the
most extraordinary problems ever pre
sented in a criminal action. Here, in
brief. Is the Government's side of Itâ
the only side that has been disclosed.
In fact, the Government has but partly

Two answers to these questions were
given yesterday in the great land fraud
hearing before Federal Commissioner
E. H. Heacock.
Did Henry P. Dimond, in his desire
to obtain revenge for Frederick A.
Hyde's refusal to pay him for legal
son-ices, write anonymous letters to the
Secretary of the Interior. Ethan Allen
Hitchcock, alleging that his former
client was guilty of gross frauds in ob
taining title to forest reserve lieu lands
and urging that Hyde's methods be |
investigated on lines suggested by the
writer? Did Dimond also, as a blind
'or future use in screening his own
conduct, write anonymous letters to
himself, copies of which were inclosed i
in one of the epistles to the depart-

The first two letters, as appeared by
their postmarks, had been mailed in
San i Francisco on the same day, De
cember 22, 1903, the very day that Di
mond had angry interview with
Hyde. Dimond denied that he had'
ever seen these letters or sent them
to the secretary. They were then read,
ting in part as follows:
.;:! I. â¢"
SAN FRANCISCO.
"The. first and second," he said, "I
received \ from , Secretary | Hitchcock.
The secondhand third came to me by
mail."' .
to those set forth in the indictment.
Was this true?"
"Well, it may be possible that some
letters were laid on my desk and I
just put my name to them without
looking to see what they contained."
This was one of the witness' slips.
For the next half hour the Government
lawyer kept him 'on nettles- by pro
ducing paper after paper filed with
the department and bearing date after
Dhnond swears he had quit Hyde's
service, refusing longer to act as his
attorney because he believed his' client
was "crooked." These documents in
cluded appearances and letters urging
the department to immediate action
on the Hyde lieu selections. The
names of C. W/ Clark, the millionaire,
and Elizabeth Dimond, the alleged
myth, appeared among the selectors
and* the cases were a portion of those
which the witness had already admit
ted to have excited his suspicions.
Heriey pressed Dimond to explain how
his acts in these selections, after he
had denounced Hyde's methods, could
be harmonized with his ' professions o*
innocence, but the witness took refuge
in I his- former statement that he be-
Ueved the fraud, if fraud there were,
had been committed against the States
of California and Oregon, rather than
the United States. ' .
HEXEY PRODUCES DOCUMENTS.
Then Heney dug down into his leath
er bag and drew forth a bunch of four
letters. Dimond seemed to anticipate
what was coming and braced himself
in his chair. * First the Government at
torney called Detective Burns to Iden
tify the letters. *
Â¦ "Did you not call Hyde to your of
fice on" December 22, last, and was he
not there an hour and thirty-five min
utes ?" asked Hen%y. \
"No, only thirty minutes." .
"And did you not tell him that if he
did not pay. you for your work you
would not feel obliged to keep secret
his methods? And did not
this" lead to" Hyde's sudden departure
in anger?"
"No,"â to both questions â "that was
not the reason for his leaving.", -
"You did not .think it: a good time
then- to. get*; some â¢ money, out of him?
Did you not demand $10,000 - as . the
price of your silence?'" '1^
, For an instant'; the> witness squirmed
! in his chair, but his ever ready "No",
came at last. '
"I told Hyde that the $10,000. which
he; claimed /wassail he >had. been able
to get â¢ out of Benson 'would \ not more
than pay me justly 'Â¦ f or ; my ' work.", v ,

tion to ; Dimond to take vengeance \ on
Hyde for his "trickery," and /closes:
"Look *out for Walter Bush, as, he is
Hyde's sleeping spy." , >
THE QUARREL WITH HYDE.
On examination of the "letters it ap
peared that they had been written on
a Bliokensdoerfer machine. When ques
1 tioned further, , Dimbnd admitted that
he had owned a typewriter of this
make, but left it in Washington, while
of the letters, six In number, five had
been mailed in this city between Au
gust and December last. One of these
letters had been destroyed as soon as
received, the witness said, because it
contained the names of two women, one
dead, the other living. "It connected
Hyde's name with these women," said
Dimond. who then privately informed
Heney of the names in question. Th*
matter was dropped, and Dimond next
handed Heney one of the letters that
he had kepi, saying it was ( the last but
one he received, and that it hod been
slipped under his office door late in
December. This letter was the one
shown. to Hyde at Felton's suggestion.
It was. read ..in evidence with another
received by mail on August 18 as the
postmark showed. This accounted 'or
three of the six anonymous lettars, the
witness promising to produce the othsr
three if they could be found.
URGES HYDE'S BETRAYAL.
The first letter follows:
Now Mr. ; D, you have told several friends
of ours that you "merely took charge of
Hyde's legal and legislative business In Wash
ington" and that you "knew , nothing 6f th*
work and affairs out here and were now In
no way connected with him." We of course
know that his bribery of clerks dates way
back of your employment, but we also know
you were In his confidence and saw many of
his friends while in Washington. If . you are
no longer connected 1 with him you I are, . of
course, free to take a case against him. '
The time has come; your name is before the
Secretary and you will receive a visit from a
person representing the Government ,ln a day
or two.
Listen to what he says, and If you do not
follow his advice you win make a grave mis
take. Every move you made last January
was watched' and you will have to explain
your meeting with Valk (I need not mention
any other names) and prove by the stand you
take you were not in the ring. Don't wait for
the ' Secretary to send for you. but go to
Washington at once, in time to Â¦ advise about
Bennon. You are all right with Brltton &
Gray and your many, friends behind you it will
bo the making of you with the administration.
You can give) us the name of the party we
want to forge Jhe last link in the chain. *- If
you know a Mrs. Curtis here you <. will -guess
what we want. These letters have been for
the purpose of educating -you to" an under
standing of what you as an attorney can give
uÂ«. and your official- oath makes it your duty
to" expose a crime, while the treatment you
have received at Hyde's hands binds 'you to
nothing eave legal secrecy, surely not the
matters that came to your own knowledge
while In Washington.
You will be offered $2oOO retainer and $2500
more In case of conviction to assist Henny.
Take thought before refusing. Â¦
"Well, if you are passing compli
ments," Heney remarked, "we think
that Mr. Dimond has the typewriter on
which these anonymous letters were
written. What typewriter do you use,
Mr. Dimond?" .
"The Remington," answered the wit
ness. â¢
"No, Mr. Dimond has the copies," re
torted Burns, who was 1 sitting near.
The secret service man referred to the
Government claim that the letters of
fered by Dimond were manufactured
to be inclosed in the letters to the de
partment.

cases In Washington and elsewhere. He spent
many months in Washington, with headquar
ters at Brltton & Gray's. Very suddenly last
spring Just after his return from Washington
he severed his connection with Hyde. I have
since learned that he became acquainted with.
Hyde's methods while In Washington and de
clined to act further, giving as a -reason
failure on Hyde's part to follow the courÂ»#
advised by B. & G. and himself to meet your
suspension order. Neither Hyde or Bennon
have ever paid him for his services in the
â¢land deal and as a consequence he cannot
but have a bitter feeling. In fact told a friend
he was going to sue them, when the news .>Â£
Benson's arrest came. Now tbe key to' tlie
situation is this man Dimond. and If you can
induce him to act with you you can get a
conviction. I have tried to work on him by
a series of letters of which I enclose copies.

"Mr. Dimond," asked Wheeler, "have
you any suspicion as to the source, of
these letters?"
"None whatever," said his client. '
"I reiterate my absolute confidence In
Mr. Dimond," remarked Wheeler, "and
challenge the Government to prove Us

rageous letters."
"We are trying this case," was
Heney's only response.

Sheriff Reese said to-night that the
fellow convicts of Roberts at Folsom
had raised a fund with which to save
him from the gallows, and "that the
other convicts confined in the County
Jail herei Andrew Meyers, "William
Leverone; Harry Eldridge and Joseph
Murphy, have counted on the assist
ance of Roberts' friends to enable them
to escape from the County Jail before
their return to the Folsom peniten
tiary.
Haggerty found In front of the, cell of
William Leverone, one of the retaken
Folsom prison escapes, a small .bundle
of newspapers. A long string, attached
to the bundle led to Leverone's cell,
and Haggerty at once realized that
Leverone had been trying to swing the
papers over to the cell of Harry Eld
ridge, another of 'the Folsom escapes,
likewise under a charge of murder.
Haggerty - opened the- bundle and
found inclosed a letter addressed to
Eldridge and written by Leverone, who
signed himself by his nickname,
"Slim." In the letter, in the vernacular
familiar to convicts, Leverone assured
Eldridge that if the friends of Joseph
Roberts, another of .the escapes, are to
be relied upon they were all in a fair
way to escape. He said It would be an
easy matter to secure Haggerty in
passing' the corridor by a wire lasso
and take his . keys and revolver away
from "him through the wicket. He as

REPORTS from Havana concerning the Cuban Con
gress, 1 whose spring session was recently opened,
are to the effect that no less than 658 questions re
lating to disputed elections were submitted to the House,
and as a result there is confusion on all sides, a general
cry and clamor of "fraud," arfd every prospect of a stren
uous session. It is not feared, however/ that anything
serious will follow the confusion, for the disturbance is
confined to politicians, the business elements and work
ing classes being evidently well satisfied with the con
ditions of trade and industry and with the Government.
The statements in the annual message of President
Palnia show that the: administration has been fairly suc
cessful-in its work, and has given Cuba a much better
government than prevails in most Spanish-American
countries. A summary of the message says the President
points out that the mortality-rate of the island is but
15 per 1000 inhabitants, being the lowest since 1820.
Street cleaning in Havana, has been improved, while the
cost has been less than it was under American adminis
tration. The President recommends an appropriation. of
$2,000,000 lor improving existing roads and constructing
new ones. The summary continues:
"The fiscal report makes an -excellent showing/ and
the industrial situation shows steady improvement. Su
gar, tobacco and fruit all show a notable increase in
value and quantity. It is particularly gratifying to note
uearly $1,000,000 increase in the of fruit. : This
indicates that Cuba is ! getting;away from her former two
crop status. The notable increase in. the 4 number of
horses and cattle is also encouraging, for, the reason-that
these' animals are * essential factors "in sblarge a' part of
Cuba's productive activity. It is true' that, the- present,
number is only about ; one-half of â¢ that of ten years ; ago,

Its labyrinthine ways.

Her gaze Is past the empty plain,
Out in the flume of fire
Where day sinks Into the waiting night
With Its dreams and its vain desire..
And there two slender lovers walk

And no wind stirs the gentle peace

CALIFORNIA is the most interesting State in the
Union in the variety of its natural capacities.
On the 23d inst. the people of Modesto celebrate
in ample form the completion of an irrigation system
that will make fertile 260,000 acres of dry land, by sup
plying it with abundant water for use in the raising of
all kinds of crops. Just one month later a convention
will meet ;in this city to devise ways and. means for
keeping water off an equal acreage on the delta and tule
lands and islands of the Sacramento and San Joaquin
rivers. The too great abundance of water on these wet
lands is evidence of the exhaustless supply of water
for diversion to the dry lands, and the problem of the
maintenance of both descriptions of. land in fertility in
terests the whole State. 0"^ â¢
The success of the! irrigation project which is to be
celebrated at .Modesto furnishes a valuable means of
contrasting what the people can do for themselves with
what the Federal Government will do for them in the
irrigation plans which it ; is effectuating under the law
*bf Congress. It will do more than this, for- it will show
the relation of climate to irrigation and to the capacity
of irrigated lands to bearthe cost of making, them fertile
by water. j~ In; California land will bear a higher cost
for irrigation, because in this climate it produces more
â¢crops in a year, and crops with a higher market value.
Yet it will probably be found that the cost of irrigation
here will be far less than that furnished by the Govern
ment works. ', Â£., '*/- , : '\
).- The success ; of Modesto -is wrought under the Wright
law. ? The author/ of . that law was ; a citizen of Modesto*
when- he, was elected to the Legislature for the purpose
of proposing the measure which bears his name. There
has", been much controversy over. it. Losses 'have oc
curred in some places where its application was at
tempted, and' the organization, of some districts has
been voided by the courts. All. this may be without im
peaching the applicability of /the. law ' to any conditions'
that were in line with its purpose.
- If it^never did anything more than enable the irriga"-.
tion of , the vast acreage of which Modesto is" the center;
it is already as fully ; vindicated as the Federal law is
likely to be. This successful achievement may renew
interest in its .merits and cause - its application , in' other;
districts, conformatory ; to the court decisions â¢ that affect
it. vThe Modesto people have earned" the rights to cele
brate, and the State joins in their day^s of? jubilee. :

A modern Enoch Arden of Seattle, Wash., was ar
rested for burglary for trying to break into his home
and a welcome on his return. Upon his promise to go
away and not bother the new husband the charge was
dismissed. That is an easier way of adjusting family
relations than the old style, if not quite so romantic.
In the surprisingly short time of
seventy years from Yermak's entrance
to the valley of the Obi. Russian pio-:
neers had. reached the Pacific,.. Oc^an
and penetrated to the mouth of the
Lena and established important cen
ters of civilization at numerous points
which have continued to increase to
the present day. Tobolsk, Omsk,
Tomsk, Krasnoyarsk, Minusinsk, Ir
kutsk, Yakutsk, Verkhne Udinsk and
Nertchinsk have- behind them as long
a history as Salem and Boston. While
they have not developed in size like
those early New England settlements,
they can render an excuse for not so
doing by pointing to the limiting con
ditions- which have surrounded them,
which even yet are only partially re
moved. But at Tamsk one will now
find a university which will compare
favorably with any in the United
States fifty years ago. At Krasnoyarsk
he will find a library of a wealthy Si
berian, filled with many treasures,
which any European library would
covet, but could not obtain. At Min
usinsk, three hundred miles away
from the Siberian railroad, is a mu
seum which is the admiration of the
world, where from the local collec
tions the transition from the stone to
the bronze and the iron age is more
perfectly shown than anywhere else.
In this collection are sixty thousand
specimens well housed in a two-story
brick building, and arranged and
classified after the most improved
methods, with an equally commodious
library building adjoining it. AH this
has been accomplished by private sub
scription. And this is only a specimen
of what is to be found in nearly every
Siberian town of more than ten thou
sand inhabitants. The country abounds
in museums and in people, who are in
terested in them. Minusinsk has but
fifteen . thousand people, but in the
larger cities of Irkutsk and Khabar
ovsk, where branches of the Royal
Geographical Society exist, the muse
ums, though n'ot so much specialized
as this one at Minusinsk, are built and
organized on a larger plan.
Irkutsk, nearly four tho'usand miles
east of St. Petersburg, though contain
ing only about sixty thousand Inhabi
tants, has, besides its large museum,
an elegant opera house, vying in pro
portion and fullness of equipment
with anything found in America out-
Bide of New York city. It has a public
reading room and a library containing
books and magazines in all the leading
languages of Europe. At Blagovyes
chensk, on the Amur River, fourteen
hundred miles farther east, in a city
of thirty thousand, one will find, in
addition to a well-equipped hospital
and library and museum, a community
of such high musical culture that a
local society renders with ease and in
most creditable style such choruses as
those of Saint-Saens* "Samson and De

" 'Ah, forget it,' said Belle, 'didn't
I tell you that I'd be your trusty?
S'pose I'd let that thing murder you
'thout helping you?'
"The matron was taken back by the
trusty's unconcerned air and relin
quished all hope of thanking Belle with
words. When Belle died there were
many who had known her, who recall
ed her record as a pickpocket, but
there were a few who said, 'there was
a criminal with a wcrd of honor.' "
"Several years ago Belle was sent
up for four years in San'Quentin. At
tKat time the matron of the prison
had been having great difficulty in se
curing a reliable trusty, among the in
carcerated females. I suggested that
she give Belle a trial. I said to her
that if Belle promises you that she
will do as you bid her, she will do it.
"So Belle Wilson was given the posi
tion ;' of trusty. Not two days after
Belle was introduced to her new job a
big, husky negress attempted to cut
the matron's throat. She had her down
on the floor of' a cell and with up
raised hand was about to plunge the
knife into the matron's neck when
Belle came along at a bound. With
one swipe she knocked the frenzied
negress prone on the floor and quickly
relieved .her .of her weapon. The
matron was deeply indebted to her
trusty and attempted as best she could
to thank her.
Belle was known to the oldest offi
cers of the police force. All knew her
to be a larcenist of the most clever
type, yet they knew her as well by
her word of honor, as they did by her
bad record. "When Belle ever told you
she would do a thing," said an old
policeman the other day, "you could
bet on it that she would keep her
word.
"There is honor among thieves";
that oft quoted phrase was exempli
fied in the character of Belle Wilson,
the noted female pickpocket, who died
a miserable death a few days ago,
alone and forsaken by her former
friends.
Honor Among Thieves.
The question which suggests itself is:
Do these eels hibernate naturally when
they experience cold beyond a certain
point, or is the condition noted that of
temporarily suspended animation, the
forerunner or preliminary stage of
death?
For it is certain that the eels are not
really dead. The returning tide .bears
them 1 - on its surface at first, as though
they were lifeless, but after a few min
utes they wriggle about a little, and
soon they dive below, slowly and care
fully, but very much alive. The fisher
men usually make things certain by

The excessively cold seasoTV- at. QueÂ«
bee has had a curious effect upon thi
salt water eels. It is their custom In
winter to bury themselves In the sand
or mud below high water mark and!
there hibernate.
This winter the* frost has been so
keen for weeks at a time that the sur
face of the wet sand has become a
sheet of Ice directly the water ebbed
away. Probably this has had the effect
of partially depriving the burled eela
of air, and the fear of death by asphyx
iation has sent them scurrying out Into
the open, where they meet with imme
diate paralysis from the cold.
The appearance of the beach on some
cold mornings has been remarkable.
Thousands of eels from thirty to sev
enty Inches in length, each one about as
brittle as an icicle and stretched out as
straight as a stick, lie about or stand
upright from the sand for a good third
of their length.
Carts and wheelbarrows, as well as
boats, have been filled day after day,
and the available markets for fresh
eels were long ago glutted. Skinning,
salting and smoking have given em
ployment to many, who otherwise would
have been idle. 'Â¦.-*,*
What the Cold. Does*.
IT has remained for colored women in Los Angeles to
devise a new form of philanthropy. >They have pro
ceeded to organize the Southern California Home
Association and Floral Investment Company./ The ob
ject is to provide a pleasant home for aged negroes and
orphans of the colored race. The support of the home is
to be derived from the sale of carnations and other
flowers. The old people and -the children, not being
strong physically, could not be expected td perform
hard labor, but the growing of. flowers for the market
will -supply them with light and profitable occupation
and they will find themselves amid pleasant surround
ings and with comforts.
An organization was effected several months ago, prin
cipally through, the endeavors of . Mrs. Mary J. Jackson.
A tract of five acres of land admirably adapted to the
culture .of flowers was secured at Duarte. Six town lots
have also been secured in addition, so that the ground
is ample for the experiment in its earlier stage. The
soil has been tested and has been proved to be desirable
for flower farming. It is all under a good irrigation sys
tem. The association is undenominational, but it has
enlisted the efforts of many colored church people^
The women of the association have already paid a
share of the money heeded to purchase the land for the
flower farm, and charitably inclined pecJpie have pledged
quite large amounts. It has been decided, in view of the
favorable financial conditions attending the beginning of
the enterprise, to start work on the first home buildings
on May 1. Only one cottage will be built at a time, the
purpose being tp handle the home conservatively, and
not to incur any debt that might prove td be burden
some later. In addition to cash donations, the colored
people of Duarte, Monrovia and other near-by commu
nities have promised to give several days of work each
â¢to save expense and to get the farm in shape as soon as
possible at the lowest possible limit of cost.
The officers of the association are all colored women.
Mrs. M. J. Jackson is the president; Mrs. rLouisa Oliver,
vice-president; Mrs. H. A. Jones, secretary; Mrs. S. L.
Jones, treasurer. Carnations have been selected for the
original plantation of flowers because they are in strong
demand in the* south, and also because it has been dis
covered that they grow to great perfection at, Duarte.
Several schemes were considered by the practical
minded colored women before they hit upon the idea of
the flower farm, the leading purpose being to utilize the
labor commercially of those to be cared for, and so to
make the home for the aged and the orphans as near
self supporting as possible. It is not supposed that
flower culture will pay the entire expense? of the main
tenance of the home, but it will go far in that direction
if it is managed on business principles. Auxiliary organ
izations of colored people are to be. formed in the south
ern counties to secure co-operation and support.

HEADQUARTERS OF THE CALL,
6 HENRIETTA, STREET, COVENT
GARDEN. LONDON. April 10.â Sir
Hiram Maxim's latest invention, a
piquant mystery for many months.
now proves to be a hugre toy â a series
of captive flying machines in which
passengers may enjoy the delights of
en aerial voyage in perfect safety,
with the addition of a variety of thrill
ing Kimllans that will afford excite
ment even to thoFC whose jaded nerves
ere no longer stimulated by shooting
the chute or looping the loop.
Sir Maxim says, however, that this
most recent production of his inven
tive skill Is designed palely to make
money and enable him to accumulate
funds enough to perfect an airship
that will really do business.
The Invention itself may be briefly
described as a mammoth merry-go
round, with !iyinR machines attached,
that circle through the air at express
Â¦peed in lieu of the tame, rair.bow
colored wooden Ftceds that to the ac
companiment of nerve-racking music
row Joe sedately round and round at
country fairs and festivals. In ap
pearance it resembles a huge inverted
Skeleton umbrella with ten ribs. At
the end of each rib, attached to it by
lonjr wire ropes, which allow it to
eu inp free, is a whale-shaped car,
tiphtren fett lens, and surmounted by
en aeroplane. The revolving motion
is derived from the revolutions of a
central shaft operated by a powerful
motor. The venturesome passengers
enter the car through a slit in one
ride. On the opposite side are arranged
Â£. series of loopholes, through which,
while whirling: around at forty or fifty
miles an hour, they may gaze upon the
fleeting terra firma â if not otherwise
t nca?ed in wrestling with a new kind
of seasickness.
A man who took a trial flight In one
of these revolving whales at a forty
five miles an hour gait said that at
that rate the car swings outward at I
such an angle that the side at' which ;
the passengers enter ..became virtually
the bottom and. pinned to their seats
lÂ»y centrifugal force.' to the bewildered
observers things tcrrcstial seem to be
nil upside down.
"My command of language is not
adequate to describe what my other
sensations were," he said, "but there
were lots of them and they were all
thrilling."
Two of these "flying machine merry
po-rounds" now are in process of erec
tion in this country, one at Earls*
< ourt and the other at the Crystal
Falace. which will enter upon their
dizzy whir!? next summer, and it would
seem as If -the St. Louis World'* Fair
reople couldn't do better than build
one. too.
The captive flying: machines. Sir
Hiram asserts, he will develop into
free flying machines.
"I shall commence on a small scale,"
he explained, "and. as in earlier ex
periments, I shall attach my machine
to a long arm, which, while preventing
it from escaping;, will allow it to move
upward or downward in the air. When
1 have succeeded in perfecting my
motors, my aeroplanes and my screw
propellers so a* to make the machine
fly above the point at which it is at
tached to the rotating arm, I shall
know that its lifting effect is greater
than Its weight.
"My next step will be to make a still
larger machine and run it around a
circular track about 500 feet in
diameter, the machine being kept in
place by being attached to the rotating
arms of a suitable device, which will
neither retard its action nor assist in
propelling it.

1 HEADQUARTERS OF THE CALL,
5 HENRIETTA STREET, COVENT

131 ick of Pasadena, Cal., is expected in
London shortly after an adventurous
journey In the heart of Darkest Africa,
in the course of which his expedition
j was reported to' have been massacred
jby the warlike Turkana tribe inhabiting
j the country to the west of Lake Ru
dolph.
Major F. R. Burnham, formerly of
Pasadena, who was at the head of the
expedition and who had previously re
turned to London, leaving Mr. Blick in
charge, has since received word that
the rei>orted massacre was based on a
severe fight. In which some of the na
tives attached to the expedition were
killed. None of the white men were in
jured. The expedition, which had been
dispatched by the East Africa syndi
cate, penetrated almost to the center
of Africa through- territory in which
no white men had been seen before.
Much of the journey to Lake Rudolph,
1 which is 300 miles north of the Uganda
railroad, had to be made on foot.

A man in St. Clair County, 111., found guilty of mur
dering his wife, sued for the insurance on her life and
the Supreme Court of that -State decided the company
must pay him. Such a decision may be an exact inter
pretation of the insurance policy, but it places a premium
on crime and nullifies the rule of law which, provides
that. a' man cannot profit by his own wrong.
The men who now support the declarations of New
York and Pennsylvania have ever since 1896 declared
that Mr. Cleveland was and is a Republican, because he
stood out on former issues, just as thousands of Demo
crats will now stand out on the personal issues which
are to be in this year's campaign.
The burden of proof of these personal charges' rests
upon the accusers. Let them face the country with-spe
cific proof that our peace has been endangered. Let
them furnish evidence of the specific acts that menace
the stability of business. They need not expect to get
through the campaign without answering. The Ameri
can people will not act upon vague charges and general
declarations. They learned better in 1896. That cam
paign of education transformed our political methods;
and ended the whoop-de-dooden-doo campaign, run on
ditties set to the tune of "The Camp Town Races."
That, would do in 1840, when people were told to "Vote
for Harrison, therefore, without^ a why or , wherefore,"
and Van Buren was. beaten because somebody said he
had a set of. gold spoons. But now the people demand
a why and a wherefore, and men who know why and
wherefore . they are Democrats will repudiate assaults
upon the President of the United States intended to
punish him for enforcing the law in accordance with his
oath of office. \
The opposition policy is to nominate a' recordless
sphinx, with David B. Hill as the boss of a campaign,
to wink at socialism with one eye and at capitalism with
the other.
As long as the issue is merely personal it will release
from part}' allegiance an immense Democratic vote, of
real conservatives, who see in the President's enforce
ment of the law the policy which they wish their own
party to follow, just as in 1896 the sound "money Demo
crats saw in the gold standard policy of McKinley that
issue which they knew their own party ought to have
made. These men know the folly of charging that the
President menaces "international peace and business sta
bility and prosperity."
Why do not his accusers show in what particular he
has threatened international peace? To complain that
he is dangerous to the present prosperity of the coun
try is an almanac joke. When his party came into
power there was no prosperity. The Democratic free
silver agitation had bankrupted business and brought the
national credit near to breaking down. Prosperity was
restored and business was made stable by the defeat of
evcrjthing for which the Democratic, party had. stood
from the time Senator Vest said, in 1893, that "the party
and Mr. Cleveland had reached the, parting of the ways.?
These interests which seek to prosper by violation of
the law had involved large numbers of innocent people
in investments in stocks that were sure, soon or late,
to be lost because they lacked a proper foundation of
legal assets. When the President enforced the law, the
illegal and improper nature of the securities appeared
and those lost who had been beguiled into investment:
Since then there has been a studied attempt" to direct
the wrath of the innocent losers against the President.
To this scheme the party is lending itself. -â¢
If this were done by the yawping wing alone, that
wing that flops for Mr. Hearst, it would cause no sur
prise. But it is also done by the swallow, tails, the so
called respectable and conservative element, the high
?nd holy persons, who have put themselves under. the
leadership of Mr. David B. Hill. It is hypo.critical politics
of an extreme kind. The purpose is to secure the
assistance of the "high financiers" whose schemes of
spoliation have been blocked by the President. \ -
r t-\ HE Pennsylvania Democratic Convention returns
I the lead of New York in making a personal issue
* against President Roosevelt. The- sentiment of
the country is declared to be "distrustful of his adminis
tration and fearful of his' extraordinary, erratic : and
autocratic assumption and exercise of power."
Like New York, Pennsylvania files no bill of particu-'
lars. Ndt an instance of any assumption of power is
cited, because there is none. The President is. declared
to be "a menace to constitutional government." That
was said of Lincoln" and of Grant, by the same, style
of partisans. The men who say it now know that
there is no more truth in it than there was then. The
fact is that President Roosevelt has been conspicuously
unpartisan in' his administration. What the New- York
and Pennsylvania denunciation means is that his en
forcement of the law against those who violate it has
made him dangerous to the illicit business interests~of
the country. *\>* v^
curred on the bench of the Supreme
Court and the Governor appointed a
Judge to fill the vacancy. The consti
tution provided then, as now, that the
successor should be elected at the next
general State election. This provision
was neglected,^ however, and the ap
pointee retained his seat on the bench.
To this method a citizen j named Plck
ett, who was one of the street reform
ing brigade, took exception, and dis
puted the right of the Judge to oc
cupy the bench after the term had ex
pired, according to his interpretation.
Taking the bull by the horns, so to
speak,- Pickett entered the courtroom,
which was then on the corner of Clay
and Kearny streets, and just before
the Justices filed out of their chambers
to take their, places on the bench? he
fairly and squarely squatted himself
down in the chair about to be occupied
by the Judge whose seat he disputed.
The Judges entered the courtroom led
by the Chief Justice, TV. ,T. Wallace,
and to their utter astonishment found
this citizen reformer in the seat. Judge
Wallace looked amazed and,' calling the
court crier, inquired what It all meant..
Pickett answered for himself, and in
formed the Judges that he had Just
as much right to a seat on the bench
as Judge Blank, whose term had ex
pired by limitation of law.
Pickett was removed by force and
an order was Instantly entered^commit
ting him to the custody of the Sheriff
to be confined in jail pending the fur
ther order of the court. The self-in
stalled "Judge" was -escorted to the
Broadway Jail, whire he remained for
three years, until 1880, when the new
constitution abolished the then exist
ing Supreme Court. It was one of the
last acts of the defunct court to lib
erate Pickett. The old man died short
ly after, never having changed his
mind as to his right as an American
citizen. * "â¢-'
What was virtually a life, imprison
ment for contempt of court stands
among the decisions of our Supreme
Court. The case 'and its consequence
grew out of, a citizen's interpreting the
constitution in contravention to that of
the Supreme Court.

'Fresh From Her Recent
Triumph in Gotham^
FAMOt4? VOCALIST. WHOSE
SWEET VOICE WILL SOON BE
HEARD IX THIS CITY.
Boyd left a will devising his entire
estate to Jean McGregor Boyd, whom
he declared to be his wife. She was
only devised a life interest in the es
tate, the property^ upon her death to go
to the two sons.
In the meantime Mrs. Hollowbush
remained in Philadelphia. She held no
communication with the Boyds and in
consequence the capitalist and his fam
ily, which consisted of his wife and two
tons, George Davis Boyd and Henry
St. Clair Boyd, were greatly surprised
when in March, lSST^she arrived in San
Francisco and called upon the capital
ist- "What took place at the inter
view between Boyd and the womar*
from whom at that time he had been
divorced forty years is not known, but
it resulted in the signing by Mrs. Hol
lowbush of a document declaring that
she was not the wife of Alexander
Boyd and that for the sum of $3500 she
waived any claim she might have
against him or his estate. Then she
returned to Philadelphia, and was not
heard of again until a year after
Boyd's death, which occurred in Feb
ruary, 1903. Then she startled the fam
ily by appearing, through Lloyd &
Wood and Bishop, Wheeler & Hoeffler,
as the widow of Boyd. She asked to
have his entire fortune distributed to
her ss his widow, claiming that she
was the victim of a fraudulently ob
tained divorce.
FORGETS FIRST WIFE.
Alexander Boyd was one of the pio
neers of California. He came here in
1S48, bringing with him his young wito,
who, when he married her in New
York in 1811, was a Margaret Ander
son. They located in Sacramento.
Differences arose and on November 1C,
1S57, Boyd secured a decree of divorce.
Fifteen days after the decree was
granted Mrs. Boyd became the wife of
Henry Hollowbush, and after a short
time went with him to Philadelphia,
leaving behind the son born of her
union to Boyd. In 1S91 the son died,
leaving two children, who are at present
in New York, and who, under their
grandfather's will, are each left $200 a
month for a period of 125 months.
Nothing was heard of Mrs. Hollow
bush, and Boyd, who, in January, 1862.
had married Jean McGregor, remained
here and by careful investment amass
ed a large fortune, purchasing blocks
of realty in this city in what is now
known as the wholesale district, and
also buying lands in various parts of
the State. He also invested in gilt
edged securities, with the result that in
a few years he was considered, one of
the wealthiest San Francisco capi
talists.
Margaret Hollowbush, the former
wife of 'Alexander Boyd, who, when the
capitalist died, came forward and tried
to claim his $1,500,000 estate on the
ground that Boyd had fraudulently ob
tained a divorce from her more than
forty years ago, is not and never was,
the widow of Boyd and therefore is not
entitled to any portion of his estate.
Boyd's only widow Is Jean McGregor
Boyd, to whom he was married in this
city In January, 1862. five years after
he obtained a divorce from the woman
who is now Mrs. Hollowbush, and who
became Mrs. Hollowbush fifteen days
after the decree of divorce was grant
ed. The decree was not fraudulently
obtained, and therefore Mrs. Hollow
bush's claim amounts to nil. These
facts are set forth in a -decree of par
tial distribution of the Boyd estate to
Mrs. Boyd prepared by Attorneys Gar
ret McEnerney and G. H. Mastick, le
gal representatives of Mrs. Boyd, and
signed yesterday by Judge Coffey. Thus
ends one of the most sensational ac
tions ever commenced in the local Pro
bate Court, a very tame finish consid
ering the amount of money involved
and the prominence of the parties con
cerned. Mrs. Hollowbush once ac
cepted $3500 for her signature to a
waiver of all the claims she might have
against Boyd. Rumor has it that she
has accepted a slightly larger sum for
her withdrawal in the present pro
ceedings, but the rumor is unconfirmed,
the attorneys in the case refusing to
discuss the matter.
BOYD A PIOXEER.
District Attorney Byington denied
that there had been any agreement or
understanding with any witness that
he or, she should not appear and testify
at the trial of the defendant.
The Judge said he would" take the
matter under advisement till Tuesday
morning.
The preliminary examination* of Mrs.
Cordelia Botkin on a charge of causing
the death of Mr?. Ida Henrietta Deane
at/Dover, Del., . in August, 1898, by
sending a box of poisoned candy to
Mrs. Elizabeth Dunning, Mrs. Deane's
sister, was concluded [ before Police
Judge Conlan yesterday morning. The
Judge will render. .his decision- on a
motion to. dismiss made by the "defend
ant's attorney on Tuesday morning.
The witnesses examined for the pros
ecution yesterday were Professor
Thomas Price, who made an analysis
of the poisoned candy; A. C. Rdselle,
who found a piece of the seal that had
peen on the candy 'box, and W. -W.
Barnes, clerk at the Victoria Hotel.
This concluded the case for the prose
cution.
Attorney Clark for the defend
ant said he would submit the case, but
would make a motion to dismiss on the
grounds that the complaint was sworn
to on information and belief; thaf it
had been disclosed during the proceed
ings that certain witnesses had testi
fied on the understanding that they
would not be called upon to repeat
their testimony bef ore ' a " jury on the
trial of the defendant, and tnat the
evidence was insufficient to hold the
defendant.

Miss Alice M. Smith, of Minneapolis,
Minn., tells how woman's monthly suffering
may be quickly and permanently relieved by
Uydia R Pinkham's Vegetable Compound*
**1)eab Mes. Rn-kila.m: â I have never before give,n my endorse-
ment for any medicine, but Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Com-
pound has added so much to my life and happiness that I feel like
making an exception in this case. For two years every month I would
have two davs of severe pain and could find no relief, but one day when
visiting a friend I run across Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Com-
pound, â she had used it with the best results and advised me to try it
I found that it worked wonders with me ; I now experience no pain and
only had to use a few bottles to bring^about this wonderful change. I
use it occasionally now when I am exceptionally tired or worn out." â -
Miss Alice iL Sanra, 804 Third Ave., South Minneapolis, ]^^^^^"^ Chair-
man Executive Committee Minneapolis Study Club.
Beauty and strenprth in women vanish early in life because of
monthly pain or some menstrual irregularity. Many suffer silently
and see their best jrifts fade away. JLydia E. Pinkham's Vege-
table Compound helps women preserve roundness of form and
freshness of face because it makes their entire female organism
healthy. It carries women safely throu&rh the various natural
crises and is the safeguard of woman's health.
The truth about this great medicine is told in the letters from
tvooicn published in this paper constantly.
Mrs. C. Kleinschrodt, Morrison, III., says: â

Fight Promoter Accuses Snpcrrisors
of Tnraing Him Down in Grant
ing Professional Permits.
James Neil created a scene in the
Supervisors' Police Committee meet
ing yesterday and an adjournment was
ordered to suppress the utterances of
the belligerent fight promoter. The
trouble arose over the proposition of
the professional clubs to donate $250
to Mrs. McConnell, the mother of
Prank McConnell, who was seriously
injured at a boxing benefit
Neil said if the committee would
Ktvt his organization, the Pacific Club,
the June professional boxing permit he
would give Mrs. McConnell the pro
ceed* of the exhibition. In which his
eon would be the star attraction.
Neil then accused the Police Com
mittee of turning him down in his
applications for boxing permits and of
"standing in" with the other clubs.
Supervisor Ergers resented the re
mark, but Neil would not subside, al
though Sergeant at Arms Anderson
Â¦used all his persuasive powers to in
duce him to do so.

In a bout with Jack Johnson. . McVey
has been looked upon as a champion

Johnson, with his wonderful dexterity

night in the hope of taking some of the
boxing style out of Johnson and thus
reducing his effectiveness. An impres
sion has gained ground that if Jeffries
ever wipes out the color line he would
rather fight Johnson than McVey.
While Johnson might outpoint him for
Â« part of the Journey, the big fellow
knows he would land on the colored
man sooner or later and that the flght
would end right there.
With McVey he would be fighting a
man of equal strength, who can hit
hard and who might be able to land a
damaging blow.
The betting remains at 10 to 6, with
Johnson favorite.
Eddie Graney will referee to-night's
fight, which is for the colored cham
pionship, the title being held by John
son.
There will be two good preliminaries.
Jimmy Britt started east in a blaze
of glory yesterday morning to make
his mark as a monologue artlat- It will
be five months before he can commence
to train for a fight. His next appear
ance in the ring will undoubtedly be
with Young Corbett. Jimmy expects to
tight him in Mechanics' Pavilion next
November or December.
Jack Cordell has moved his training
quarters to the beach and is under the
< are of "Broadway" Billy Roche, who
hopes to make a fighter of the first
class out of this recruit from the ama
teur ranks. It was Roche who first
urged the return match with Rufe Tur
ner v hich is to be held at the Reliance
Club" next Wednesday night. He looked
tm the victory of the colored man as
considerable of a fluke and guarantees
Â» victory for Cordell if Jack follows
instructions. Turner is training In
Stockton. Jim Griffin deeming it wiser
to keep the erratic Rufe away from the
influences of the big citj\ As before,
the boxers are to go fifteen rounds,
weighing in at 133 pounds at 3 o'clock.
The show will be a double event, as
Rube Smith and George Brown are
matched for fifteen rounds at the wel
ter weight limit on the same night. No
curtain raiser will be given, as the two
bouts will fill out a good evening of
sport.

Pete showed Mike Fisher how he and
his ball tossers could wallop yester
day. They commenced early and stay
ed with the stick till all was over. All
the Tacoma stars had to do was chase
the leather on Its mad <yireer to the
various and remote comers of the lot.
Once they had a chance to run for the
plate, but that was all. Score: Oak
land 8, Tacoma 1. ,,
Oakland played great baseball. Every
run was the result of a sound bingle.
Not a fielding error happened ' while
Pete and his crew were backing â¢ up
Schmidt. He was about right for the
first time this season and winged eight
of the Tigers to the bench on strikes.
Tacoma was exceedingly lucky to land
once. ';
The game was broken up during the
progress of the third round. Dunleavy
touched a match to the fireworks with
a two-sacker to the right field fence."
Schafly brought him In when he swung
to left field for a nice one and went to
second on the throw In. Lohman'p.
timely single past second scored him.
Then Schmidt responded with a double
and Ganley did likewise and so the
inning ended with, four for the com
muters.
Then Mike Fisher had Mr. Bill
Thomas removed from the pitcher's
box and placed on the bench where the
Oaklanders could not hit him again
unless they threw bats at him. Mr.
Fitzgerald was trotted out on the fir
ing line, but the Oaks had little re
spect for his offerings and before the
game had come to a close they man
aged to wallop him for eight more solid
drives and four runs.
The fielding of the Oakland team was
about the limit for brilliancy and ac
curacy. Francks cut off several hits
with wonderful throws and stops from
deep short field. Jim McDonald ap
peared with an umpire's suit on again
and umpired a perfect game In every
respect. The score:

BURLESQUE BALL GAME.
Champion Los Angeles Team Appears
in Bad Playing Form.
LOS ANGELES. April 21. â If to
day's ball game had been advertised
as a burlesque on the national sport
It would have given perfect satisfac
tion, as far as the playing of the Los
Angeles team is concerned. Their
fielding became so bad before the
game was over that the crowd ap
plauded whenever Smith or Raymond
succeeded 5 in stopping the ball.
Wheeler pitched for the local, but be
came disgusted after "the third inning
and was pounded all over the field.
Jones, for San Francisco, was in no
condition to pitch and before the game
ended was unable to use any speed,
but tossed the ball at the batter and
trusted to luck and the fielders behind
him. He won because the locals were
literally "up in' the air." Score:

Detailed for Duty at St. Louis.
At the request of the \ management
of the St. Louis Exposition Chief of
Police Wittman has detailed Detective
Harry Reynolds to go to SL Louis,
where, during the six months' fair, he
will aid the police'of that, city in ap
prehending criminals who may wan
der that way from this coast. Los
Angeles and Portland will also send
a representative from' their detective
forces to St. Louis t for the same pur
pose. The exposition management
haB agreed to pay the expenses of
these men. who, while performing
their duties there, will be afforded an
excellent opportunity of becoming ac
quainted with" some of the^ criminals
of the Eastern and Middle * Western
State* .
â¢ The Academic League will present
the strongest lot of young athletes
ever gathered . in California at Berke
ley to-morrow afternoon '.for . the
World's Fair try-outs. " Santa - Clara
has its stars, A. B. Hunter and Sanford
Titus,' ready for business. Ukiah pins
its faith on Rawles'and Horton. Lick
School sees possible victory in the per
formances of E. C. Cope, Bert Golcher.
Adolph Beck and Paul Magerstadt. A.
de Mamiel carries the hopes of Lowell
School. J. A. Blakemore has * the
brawn that Is expected to win a mark
for. Berkeley High School, while the
Oakland colors will, be borne by Rob
ert Alelvin and C. Hall.
'". On this promising band the prepara
tory school boys are banking great ex
pectations | in the trials ; of speed and
stamina against experts from the big
colleges and the outcome of - several
of the events is being viewed with
complacency. It is a matter of record
that the youngsters have I better per
formances to their credit from a time
or distance standpoint than their older
and more experienced opponents and
victory in several instances will re
solve itself into a ' question of class,
just as it often does in trials 'between
racehorses. J So . confident are the
youths of the high schools that a tri
umphant yell has-been rehearsed and
the collegians will find life miserable if
they fall before , the speed and the
brawn of the younger set" of athletes.
Stanford, Berkeley and Nevada
know, that hard . game stares them â¢ in
the face and will send none but their
stars -to the mark. AMittle side issue
to the big meet o f the Pacific Athletic
Association and one that will keep in
terest up to the fever point will be the
second meeting of the University of
California and Stanford color-bearers.
There was considerable dissatisfaction
expressed over the outcome of last
Saturday's intercollegiate field day,
owing to the delay of the special train
bearing the , Berkeley team, and the
feeling will be fn evidence on the
paths and in the field. The presence
of the school athletes from around Ihe
bay and a few good ones coming from
distant points will add a piquant sauce
to the occasion and goad every con
testant to his greatest effort, r
The "officials for' the' meet follow:

Academic-League Will Send
Its Greatest Performers to
the World's Fair Tryouts
After several disastrous attempts the
El Primero stable's mare Divina finally
captured a purse. In the last, a mile
purse run, with only 101 pounds to ne
gotiate, she looked in a soft spot, and
after the price reached even money
there was a rush to get aboard, until
7 to 10 was the best obtainable. For
est King led for something over half
the. route, and then Lewis on Laocoon
picked up the running. From the
eighth pole to the wire Sheehan was
hard at work on the favorite and In
a hard drive won by half a length.
Soothsayer came from far back, finish-
Ing a good third.
~ NOTES OF TIIE TRACK.
Bob Smith shipped a stable of twelve
horses to the new Kansas City track
yesterday. Bob follows to-day with
Jockeys Larsen and Greenfield. Mod
red, Faulconbridge and Double Six will
be turned out at pasturage until next
fall. â¢
Ed Getchell, the portly trainer of Sad
Sam, drew down 5900 over the win of
Kermit.
Kennit came within an ace of being
scratched. Some forfeits were due
against the gelding, and as the grass
was not over a foot high Jim Long
could not see his way clear to settle
them. Horace Egbert, clerk of. the^
scales, helped Long out by guarantee
ing their payment, and Kermlt went to
the post. * , â¢
J. T. Sheehan continues riding in
splendid form. He succeeded in getting
left on Tanhauser and David S, but
did put Divina over the plate first. Of
course, the assistant starter was to
blame for his mishaps. If the Judges
would set a boy down for thirty days
every time he fails to get away from
the barrier few riders would loiter at
the webbing.

Billy Magrane's Redwald, a 9 to 6
favorite, earned a nose decision over
Flaneur in the seven-furlong selling
fixture. The latter horse had one of
his good days and cut out all the run
ning. Larsen, astride the favorite, met
with some 111 luck at the start, but
succeeded in wending his way through
the bunch and, finishing on the rail,
got up just in time to receive .the ver
dict. Otis landed Rollick in third place.
David S, with Sheehan up, did not get
away from the barrier.
"Big Bill" Knapp was much in evi
dence in the mile and seventy yard
event. He had the mount on Isabellita,
which at one stage of the betting was
3 to 1, and taking the lead on the far
turn came home nearly three lengths
in advance of Canejo, a 13 to 1 out
sider. Played down to even money
favoritism Optimo never looked a win
ner and finally lost the show to Gold
Finder by almost half a dozen lengths.
Apprentice McBride worked wonders
in the speed proclivities of Ada N and
must be fully a fifty-pound better rider
than either Wright or Cross. There
was a steady play on the rheumatic
old mare at 4 to 1, from the time bet
ting on the mile and a sixteenth event
began. She was prominent from the
start and in a mild drive at the finish,
disposed of Montana Peeress by nearly
a length. Joe Jones, on Mounteback,
took the show. Holbrook's handling of
Virgie d'Or, the favorite, was all a
Joke.
REDWALD WTXS BY A NOSE.
.The track was slow and cuppy, pre
cluding of any fast time. Favorites
kept their end up by* winning half the
programme. Pleasant weather at
tracted a good crowd.
With the able assistance of Willie
See, Bill Short turned up an easy
winner, of the two-year-old spin. Al
Dobson's colt went to the post a 3 to
2 favorite and won going away from
the 15 to 1 chance Mogregor. Rubiana,
a r.O to 1 shot, was third.
Kermit* a 100 to 1 shot ridden by W.
Narvaez and backed down to 30, took
the first race yesterday on the card
at Oakland. According to his owner's
say 60, Ihe old-time rider, Jim Lonp
Kermlt could t show as much speed as
a "yaller" dog with. a v tin can tied to
his tail, but w^s. backward about ex
hibiting: it before company.
Last summer Jim took, the Piccolo
gelding to Seattle and kept him tied
to the fence near the three-quarter pole
at The Meadows track to. cure him of
his erratic habits^for he was afflicted
with bufczing sounds in the head. There
were twelve starters in yesterdays
race, with Murat, a warm one from
Billy Randall's stable, a 3 to 2 favorite:
Murat and See -were not prominent.
Maraschino led Kermit Into the stretch,
but the latter outstayed the chestnut
and In a hard drive crossed- the line
first by three parts of a length. The
winner was touted about and many
of the books lost to the race. Tan
hauser, which ran third, could have
won hands down if away better.

The Supervisors' Street Committee
yesterday considered the Mayor's vetoes
of the two ordinances extending the
limits within which it Is prohibited to
carry on rock crushing and rock quar
rying, and filed a recommendation with
the board that the bills pass notwith
standing their disapproval by the May
or. The committee, assigns the same
reasons as were given in it's
report that two identical ordinances
pass /in spite of the Mayor's vetoes,
which were sustained by the votes of
Supervisors Alpers, Bent, Lunstedt,
Finn and Rea. . *
The Street Committee reported in fa
vor of denying the recommendation. of
the Board of Works that Mission street
between I Second and Third : be Â¦ repaved
and the sidewalks narrowed by. four
feet on each j side . at an estimated cost
of $9200. The committee holds to the
opinion that the. money should be ex-_
pended in doing necessary, street work
in other portions of the city. - ,
Chairman O'Connor stated that he
did not favor .tearing up a good paye
mentiwhileTother streets need repair
ing, and referred to the bad condition
of 'Merchant \ street, ; . which Â¦'* * property
owners petitioned to have repaved. The
repavlng of Mission- street is included
in the" bond issue. : . ;
The committee expressed itself as op
posed to the petition of 'peering ;;&

be 'amended â¢ so to permit ; of ,-Â¦ the
maintenance of wooden signs, but took
the petition under .advisement."

Mayor Schmitz decided yesterday to
hold an investigation this morning at
10 o'clock of the charges made against
Chief Emergency Surgeon George. F.
Brackett that he had demanded and
received fees for work done in his of
ficial capacityJ^jjÂ»fi|gÂ£|
Stibpenas were issued by .Secretary
Kean^.'for Mrs. Fannie Ames "of 612
Stanyan street and M. Flelshhacker, who
accused "Brackett, and their testimony
will, be heard. The transcript of testi
mony taken at the Coroner's inquest
overjthe death of the husband of % Mrs.
Ames, who was killed in . an elevator
in Fleishhhacker's factory, will also be
placed in the hands of the^Mayor. , :
Brackettappeared at the'Mayor's of
fice in the rnornlng, but his Honor was
absent and later decided on 'thls_ morn
ing's investigation. ' Brackett appeared
much disturbed over the declaration
of the Mayor that unless he could dis
prove the charges he (Brackett) would
be removed. Brackett reiterated his
previous assertions that he had a letter
of vindication from Mrs. Ames, -but
said nothing about the charge made by
Fleishhacker that the latter had charged
him a fee of $5 and Brackett had de
manded $100 more.
At the inquest yesterday on the .body
of Charles' Read, who died In the Ger
man Hospital March' 11 from injuries
'received by the explosion -of a tank in
Thompson's soda .water works, {he jury
returned ' a verdict .that the accident
was unavoidable. They added: "The
jury cannot understand why the wound
was slill bleeding at the second pack-
Ing of the wound at the Central Emer
gency Hospital."
It appeared from the testimony of
William H. Hollis that ' Dr. Pawlicki
was the ' first surgeon who treated â¢; the
case at the Central Emergency Hos
pital. William H.' Hollis testified also
that Dr. â¢ Pawlicki that 'the
pati/nt "should be taken to. the McNutt
Hospital for : ':Â¦: private/ treatment, but
Hollis decided to send *; Read" to the
German Hospital, where he was treaty
ed by Dr. G. C. Brackett.
Dr. Brackett 'testified' that ,when:he
examined the /patient /he | found % the
wound bleeding and was obliged to
prepack" "it. y
When the jury brought in the verdict
Coroner Leland stated that he had jj re
dressed bleeding wounds that had been
attended to ; by the best of surgeons,
and ' that the comment of the 'jury was
not called for. The jurors, however, re
fused to allow? the paragraph 1 to * be
stricken out. <1 They said that ; Dr.
Brackett would not have-mentioned the
matter of tlie rebandagihg of ; the
wound unless it was something un
usual. Â¦â¢..â¢Â¦ Â¦-.-. -Â¦'-'Â¦': : Â¦
The Coroner thereupon signed his

PHOTOGRAPHS EHOWIXG DAMAGE SUFFERED BY THE PACIFIC MAIL. COM
PANY'S GREAT LINER MONGOLIA. AS THE RESULT OF STRIKING A
REEF OFF BRAZILIAN COAST DURING THE VOYAGE TO THIS PORT.
It was not a sand -bar but a coral
-reef with which the Pacific Mail Com
pany's big liner Mongolia got into diffi
culties off the Brazilian coast while
steaming from Norfolk, Va., to this
port. This was discovered yesterday
when the pumps at the Hunters Point
drydock cleared the big basin of water
and left the MongollaWkeel high and
dry. Everj' blade of both propellers
is more or less bent and all six blades
are toeing taken off and will be replaced
by six spare ones provided by the
liuilders and now on board the steam
s' hip.
The coral -scratched and dented plates
and the gnarled ends of the propeller
blades tell with mote eloquence of the
liner's narrow escape. That she was
not ripped open from stem to stern was
due to the fact that Bhe. was lightly
loaded, her supply of coal, large as it
was, being little more than ballast for
her. One dent in a forward bottom
plate on the port side of the keel shows
that the reef had some sharp points
that with more pressure would have
tut the steel like a cold-chisel.
Removing the bent blades, installing
The new one, reriveting In several
places where the jar on the reef started
the steel studs, scraping and painting
the hull, will keep a large army of
workmen busy until Saturday, and on
Sunday, it is expected, the Mongolia
will Ik? ready to leave the drydock.
The Hunters Point dock Is one of the
largest In the world. The Mongolia's
t-ides tower many feet above the dock's
s=teep sills and the vessel's enormous
lÂ»ulk. by comparison, makes the roomy
basin dwindle into the Insignificance
of a terraced saucer. The Mongolia
seemed big when she lay at anchor in
quarantine; she appeared larger when
alongside the Mail Company's wharf;
she looks the leviathan she is now, as
Fhe sits In all her naked majesty on
the keel blocks of the drydock- Many
people visited Hunters Point yester
day and as long as the Mongolia Is
there she will attract large crowds.
The United States Inspector of hulls
and boilers within a few days will
make an investigation into the circum
stances of the Mongolia's encounter
with the coral reef.
Before United States District 'Judge
De Havenv yesterday - was begun the
trial of , the condemnation proceedings
instituted by United States District At
torney Woodworth on behalf of the
United States against Captain William
H. Harts of the United j States Engi
neer Corps and certain dutiable : arti
cles alleged to have been found con
cealed in his baggage.
It was alleged in the declaration filed
by" Mr. Woodworth that Captain Harts
arrived at this port on July 10, 1903, on
board the United States transport
Thomas from Japan and that he made
a declaration and entry of his bag
gage before the Collector of Customs
in which he did not mention at all
16 bolts of silk, 42 silk doilies, 32 pieces
of silk and embroidery, 21 pieces of
drawn work, 6 klmonas, 2 lace collars,
4 pieces of pina and jusi cloth, Satsu
ma gold lacquer ware, Satsuma and
cloisonne vases, jewel cases, 1 silk table
cloths, etc., all of ! the home value of
$417 85. The duty on this valuation
was $239 19, making a total of $657 04,
and under section 2802 of the Revised
Statutes of the United States the pen
alty for failing to make a declaration
is three times the sum of the home
value and the duty, amounting to
$1971 12, together with interest "and
costs of suit added to the whole.
The defendant filed a contest to the
declaration in which he denied that he
came from Japan and asserted that
he came from Manila and that the ves
sel incidentally touched at Japan on
the way out here.
He averred that he had no memo
randa by which he could have fully
set forth all of the articles mentioned
together with the cost price, and he
therefore struck out a printed clause
in the passenger declaration because
he could not truthfully subscribe to it.
He stated further that he did not make
a detailed list of any articles in his
baggage, intending thereby to Indicate
that he submitted, his baggage to the
personal inspection of me proper cus
tom-house authorities,- but he truly de
clared six trunks, three oags, one box
and one other package, eleven pieces in
all. He denied that the articles men
tioned were of a greater value than
$351 35. The additional defense was
pleaded that because he came from the
Philippines â a domestic port â there was
no penalty .for his failure to declare.
Captain Harts also denied that 'he had
attempted to defraudl s the customs ser
vice and had been and' was ready at
all times to pay whatever duties might
be imposed. A* denial was also made
of the charge that he had concealed
the articles.
Customs Inspectors Charles A. Steph
ens and J. Lundquist testified that they
found the dutiable articles "concealed"
in the center and in the sleeves of four
dresses, seventeen skirts and one coat,
the personal wardrobe of Mrs. Harts.
The waidrobe was not dutiable, and
the dutiable articles were so stowed
away as to e'acape discovery during an
ordinary examination. Al Dixon, a
newspaper reporter who was present
at the search, corroborated the testi
mony of the inspectors.
It was developed that Captain Harts
sailed from Manila and that his wife
boarded the transport at Nagasaki and
brought- with her the trunks in which
the confiscated articles were found. .
Deputy Customs Surveyor -Chauncey
M. St. John testified that Captain Harts
had preferred . charges of discourtesy
against him; that an investigation Into
the charges had been had by special
agents, and that the Secretary of the
Treasury and Attorney General Knox
had exonerated the customs officials
from any blame arid had commended
them for their action in the matter.
The trial will be continued 'on Mon
day. i~yi-~ Â£>

Tivo faTorite themes furnish subjects for the brush of Thomas Moran,
N. A., the artificial architectural beauty of -Venice and grandeur of Amer-
ican landscapes. "The (Passing Storm," which 'was painted on Long Island,
furnishes one of the most beautiful and effective colored reproductions yet
published. It Is vigorous and. yet harmonlus in color, dramatic In effect
and well balanced in its' composition. Tlie warm color of autumn browns
and yellow contrasts with gray rocks and the rich greens of the swampy
foreground and above all is a sky full of movement and Â¦ varied in its col- v^-
It Is the emotional qualities In this, as well as in nearly all of Mr. 3Io-
'"\ ran's paintings, which have contributed much to their success, and yet
underlying these there is a foundation of convincing realism.
In VThe Passing Storm" it may be seen that the elements which make
up the picture are reproduced with remarkable fidelity to nature, but at the
.same time by a sapient arrangement of masses of Light and dark opposi-
tions of brilliant and subdued color, of broad, simple masses and. intricate
detail, the artist reflects his own poetic temperament in its dramatic ef-
fect, -wealth of color and technical ability. L^^v
3Ir.' Moran's attention was first attracted to the possibilities of Ameri-
can landscape in 1871, when he accompanied the United States Govern-
ment expedition under Major Powell to explore the Yellowstone country.
Ills large painting of the "Grand Canyon of tlie Yellowstone,',' which was ;
" produced shortly after, was purchased by tlie Government. Tlie painting
is so trathfui that- geologists are able to detect and classify- from it the
thousands of feet of canyon wall, and yet the expression. of a feeling of.
sublimity is so strong that It is difficult to believe that he has not ideal-
ized his subject. " . ' Â¦. ' Â¦ i. Â¦-Â¦'.'
- He has ..since made several trips to the Rocky Mountains and has
* visited Cuba and Mexico, and it may be truthfully said that no artist has
done, more 'to make .known to the world the splendors of American land-
scapes, whose artistic possibilities he was one of the first to appreciate.
Thomas Moran, who, is sometimes called the American Turner, was â
born in Bolton, !Lancashlre, England, In- 1837. Went to Philadelphia with
his parents at the age of seven. He began his artistic career as a wood en-
graver's apprentice, and was made an associate of the National Academy
in 1882 and academician in 1884. He is a member of the Society of Amer-

PORTLAND, Or., April 21.â A broken
rail on the Northern Pacific track ten
miles from Ellensburg, Wash., in Yak
ima Canyon, caused the wreck of pas
senger train No. 4 from this city this
afternoon.
Messenger R. L. Adams of Portland
was taken from the wrecked express
car In a serious condition from injuries
received. Other than a few bruises and
a severe shaking up the passengers es
caped unhurt. The mail, baggage, ex
press and two fish cars were rolled
completely -over. The /smoker was
turned on its side. "The day. coach,
Pullman and diner stayed on the track.
The accident was at first thought to
have been caused by the two fish cars,
but later investigation leads to the be
lief that it was caused by a broken
rail. The engine was in charge of En
gineer Patchet. It turned crossways of
the track. A new track has been laid
around the wreck to let the limited
'passenger train by. The passenger train
was running at about forty miles an
hour. Traffic will be delayed till to
morrow.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
The opening ceremonies were in the
solemn and impressive service of the
order, which included the repeating by
the Sir Knights In full Templar uni
form of the Lord's Prayer in unison,
a hymn specially written for the grand
body, chanted with appropriate re
sponses, a selection by the choir and
a prayer by the grand prelate.
During the forenoon session reports
from the several commanderies were
presented.
At the afternoon session the grand
body voted an additional sum of $25,000
for triennial conclave purposes, mak
ing $60,000 donated by the Grand Com
mandery for that purpose up to date.
The following named were elected of
ficers: W. Frank Pierce of Oakland,
grand commander; J. B. de Jarnett of
Colusa, deputy grand commander;
Brilsford P. Flint of . San Francisco,
grand generalissimo; Charles Lord
Field of San Francisco, grand captain
general; Hudson B. Glllis of Siskiyou.
senior grand warden; "William D. Stev
ens of Los^ngeles. junior grand war
den; Edward Coleman of San Fran
cisco, grand treasurer (re-elected);
William A. Davies of San Francisco,
grand recorder (re-elected). The grand
commander, was elected by a unani
mous vote.
There was a concert by Bennett's
orchestra, after which a large number
of the commandery, forming eight com
panies, entered the hall in the magnifi
cent regalia of the order, each mem
ber wearing a chapeau with white, and
black plumes. After formation they
passed in review. At the termination
of . the review Eminent Commander
Browne, on behalf of the commandery,
presented Right Eminent Sir Knights,
the grand commander, a richly mount
ed sword and belt. Then the eminent
commander was called to the front, and
Sir Knight Frank H. Kerrigan, as a
token of the esteem ot the members of
the commandery for their commander,
presented him the ware that was dis
played on the table, and then, on be
half of the commandery, he presented
Mrs. Thomas H. Browne a valuable
diamond cross. This was followed by
the entrance of the commandery drill
corps, commanded by Captain Reuben
P. Hurlbut, escorting the ladies of the
choir, who as they entered sang "On
ward, Christian Soldier." Then the
corps formed a circle, within which
the ladies formed a smaller circle, and
at a signal the knights uncovered and
all knelt, while the members of the
choir chanted the Lord's Prayer. Then
followed an elaborate exhibition drill
that was perfection in every movement.
The evening closed with a ball in
which thousands took part. The affair
was under the management of Sir
Knights George W. Wittman, Charles
M. Plum, T. L. Henderson, J. Phalr,
P. ; F. Ferguson and T. P. Andrews.
The representatives of the subordi
nate commanderies of the Knights
Templar of the State of California were
present, together with the grand offi
cers, in the Masonic Temple yesterday
morning at the meeting of the Grand
Commandery.
It is doubtful if there ever was a
more fashionable audience in the Me
chanics* Pavilion than last night to
witness the reception tendered by Cali
fornia Commandery No. 1. Knights
Templar, to its eminent commander.
Sir Thomas H. Browne. The building
was lavishly decorated with bunting,
American flags and the various em
blems of the fraternity in electric
lights. There were more than 9000 peo
ple present.
On the north side of the large hall
was the reviewing stand, on which
were seated Commander Browne, the
special guest of the evening, Grand Com
mander Sir W. D. Knights, and other
grand officers and their ladies. In front
was a large table on which were dis
played a set of silverware, beautiful ta
bleware and a set of delicate glass
ware. To the right were twenty-four
young ladles who compose the choir
of Trinity Church. :
Prior to last, fall, the rate for sev
eral, years in effect in Portland and
intermediate territory to San Fran
cisco had been $3 10 per ton on lumber
of all classes, or $5 17 per thousand
based on the average weight of green
lumber. The rate was raised to ( $5 per
ton, or $8 33 per thousand, from Port
land, but was left unchanged from in
terior points.
The water rate" of $4 per thousand
to San Francisco remains unchanged.
A vigorous protest was made by Port
land mills, which claimed they would
be shut out of competition on account
of the expense of reshipment from San
Francisco to interior California. points,
and as a result the $5 rate was made
uniform from all points.
, The effect of the higher rate was to
preclude the operation of mills' In. the
interior, as they could not compete
with the northern mills having water
carriage to the southern markets. Rail
shipments practically ceased and more
than three-fourths of the mills of Cen
tral Oregon along the line of the South
ern Pacific have been idle from the' first
of the year.
The rate will probably begin May 10,
though the date has not yet been made.
The rate restores the condition of af
fairs existing when the 55 rate was
made uniform.
PORTLAND, Or., April 21.â W. B.
German, general freight and passenger
agent of the Southern Pacific Oregon
lines, to-day made "the announcement
that the $3 10 rate will be restored to
apply to common rough lumber from
points south of Portland to San Fran
cisco- and bay -points. â¢

CHICAGO. April 21.â Under the Influence of
light receipts In the Northwest wheat opened
Urn-, to-day, the July ' delivery being a shade
to We higher at 85c to 63K& A leading
factor throughout the early trading was the
strength in the 1 Northwe B tern markets.' As
the session advanced bearish action In the
corn market became a powerful influence.
There was also enough crop news of conflicting
kinds to keep traders guessing. In conse
quence the wheat pit became extremely ner
vous. Trading was more active than had been
experienced in some tlmejia6t. Houses with
Northwestern connections were persistent buy
ers on crop damage news from the Southwest.
Weather conditions showed material improve
ment and reports from the Northwest were re
ceived telling of fair progress In seeding 'Yin
a late decline in corn there was some realis
ing in wheat. The market closed flrm, with
July at 85%c. May sold between 89H.C and
89&e and closed at 83Hc . Â¦
In the absence of selling pressure from any
quarter the corn market ruled flrm early in,
the day. Later there was a fair demand for
May from the big holders, which sent the
price up l%c. July corn sold between W-Kfj;
48%c and 4Â»%c. closing at 48<*c. May closed

to cover, while the Nurthwest-and Minneapolis
arc good buyers again.' Minneapolis reports
"that a goMi many more mills will start : up
again Monday. The Price Current says that
tlu- week haH betn too cold for growth. Jones,
thÂ« Minneapolis crop expert. Hays that with
th.- most fax-orab'.<Â» weather Kansas might pos
Â»Ib!y raise 70.000,000 to 7fi,O<io,t>00 bushels.
Thri-e bad reports received Home contradiction,
however. Secretary Ellis of the Missouri State
Board of Agriculture states that thÂ«Â» cold
weathf-r has not hurt farm crops and Russell,
the Si. Louis croy expert, says that with fa
vorable weather Kansas will duplicate last
year's crop." Thus it will be seen that the

It was reported on the street that the. Los
Angeles Butter - market was Improving and
that the San Joaquin Valley creameries, which
have been shipping to this market, would now
accordingly ship to Ixis Angeles instead, which
will tend to relieve this market of soms of the
influx.
Receipts were 59,000 lbs Butter, 2055 cases
Eggs and 13,200 lbs Cheese.
The situation showed little change yesterday.
Butter continued- toiVieavy- and weak, with
larce stocks and a slow demand and some
houses quoting 18c as the top price for the
best creamery. Cheese was. weak and plentiful,
of course. Eggs were steady, but the receipts
suddenly mounted 'to a large quantity, as will
be seen, the Increase over the preceding day
being nearly 400 cases.' Large lines continue
to go Into store.

against carrying into effect the plan of distri
bution of the Northern Securities assets. The
majority vote by tlie Northern Securities stock
holders In favor of the plan seemed to check
the advance In Union Pacific, but It held Us
I firm tone on the ground that the delay in the
cxwution of the plan of distribution will be
] a time available for negotiation and for ar
j riving at a possible settlement which would
i definitely remove this vexed problem from Its
disturbing position' In the market. The In
fluence on United States Steel preferred, which
I received the most recognition, was the aRTee
; mem among the ore producers to reduce prtcea
and to seek to come to an agreement as to
tin? limit of output. As there was some sell-
Ing of Steel yesterday on the fear that the
ore agreement would be disrupted and an open
market established, there was some covering
by shorts, although the decision to reduce the
I jiriee of ore is understood to be oppoped to
the contention of the United States Steel Cor
poration. For the day of a dividend declara
tion Amalgamated Copper was unprecedent
â¢ o.!!y dull and ulugglsh. The stock loet H In
J the day. with the maintenance of the existing
dividend rate. The reduction In the discount
rate of the Bank of England was practically
ignored, as the plethoric condition of the money
markets In all the great centers deprived the
newg of Interest. Call money loaned here as
low as 1 per cent and time loans for all pe
riods showed a continued softners of tone. The
Mock market closed Irregular and below the
best. â¢ .
Bonds were irregular. Total sales (par
value). $1,715,000.
United States bonds were unchanged on call.

Aside from a Hale of one lot of 170 sacks of
river Burbanks at . $1 75' per cental : there . was
nothing new . to j report \ In ; the Potato market.
Sellers have the situation well In hand and are
exacting high prices. New Potatoes were steady"
under continued light receipts. Australian and
Oregon Ontor>3 ; were without' quotable change,
the latter being neglected and largely nominal.
A carload of . Nevadans was received and was
firmly held at $3 per. cental. ': . â¢ ' r
, The cold weather of the past few days re
tarded the growth of Asparagus and as a re
sult receipts were - much lighter. Retailers
were obliged to pay higher prices for the beat
stock and the cannen,* who -started buying- at
4}Je per pound, raised their bid to 5c and se
cured moat of the No. 1 and No. 2; at that
flgare. Peas were abundant and were selling
by the sack again. â¢ The top quotation was ob
tained only for extra fine lota. $1.76 "being
about the top for the general market. Rhubarb
continued weak .and sold at a wide range as
to quality. Tomatoes were rather weak than
otherwise and Florida lots, which were mostly
overripe, .were quoted . lower. Los . Angeles
vegetables stood as previously quoted. â¢ â¢
Receipts of Vegetables included 898 boxes
of Asparagus, 822 boxes of Rhubarb and 841

NEW YORK. April 21â The minds of specu
lators seemed to be Etlll befogged to-day over
th* \1*u of new developments in the Northern
P^curities contest, and the consequence was
that for the most part they refrained from
operating. The stock market was almost en
tirely one of f>r>eriaitif-F, and the peculiar
grounds on which this class of securities
usually mow* were not always manifest. The
rnarfcn started upward, led by Union Pacific,
wnidi ewned to be helped by the granting of
a temporary Injunction by a New Jeney court

The "'hearing'; of the suit for' divorce
of Edith Childs against Jerome Childs,
a ; mining superintendent, yesterday in
Judge Hebbard's, court; wasÂ«quiet com
pared to the -hearing of the day before,
when 'Â¦ Mrs. Childs grew ' hysterical; and
attempted to assault her husband af
ter calling him all -sorts of; names. The
hearing/ consisted ; of -the ; examination
of "Childs and several . witnesses who
claimed to have a knowledge of the
illness Mrs. Childs said ' she suffered as
the, result of Childs', treatment. .
'Childs' testimony was a complete de
nial, of the charges. made. against him
by his - wife. : His 'attorneys [ introduced
in. evidence a letter written to him by
his wife in which' she' sends him kisses.
Mrs. Childs', admitted haying written
the letter, and then volunteered the in
formation that in'that letter, when she
addressed Childs as .her 'husband, it
was the .first and the only time she
had, ever .done so.
At 'the; conclusion of . Childs' , testi
mony", Judge Hebbard . 'continued the
case until to-day ' at 2 p.m. in order to
enable . ' physicians, who - have treated
Childs, to testify as to his" condition.
Suits for, divorce were filed by Edythe

All the passengers of the Ellis/ street
car managed to escape when the crash

they realized that no one on Â¦ their car
was injured the passengers on the elec

on the cable car.
'Johnson, Robinson and Miss Cour
rier, the three injured .passengers on
the cable car, were pinned down under
the wreckage and it was fully half an
hour before they were taken from
their perilous positions. AH were bad
ly frightened and made frantic efforts
to release themselves, but were held
fast by the debris.
ATTEMPTS TO PASS TRACKS!
According to the best information,
the, accident was not the result of neg
ligence. The Ellis street car stopped
at the west side of the crossing,
in compliance with the rules of
the company. ' The Larkin street
car was approaching at v a rapid
rate of speed. Motorman Van
Eman of the electric car was signaled
by the conductor to go ahead, but as
he started some one shouted that there
was a woman trying to board the car.
The motorman applied the air brakes,
brought the big vehicle to a standstill
and allowed the woman to get aboard.
He started the car in : motion again
and, glancing to his left, saw the Lar
kin street caj* -bearing down on him
and but a few feet awajv
Van Eman at once applied the cur
rent in an endeavor to pass the cross-;
ing and avoid a collision, but he was
too late, for the approaching car struck
the electric car nearly in the middle.
Van Eman then tried to start* his car
again and get out of the.. way, but it
was closely wedged in and would not
move. .
CARS COME TOGETHER.
The collision occurred at 7^50 o'clock.
The Larkin street dummy crashed
headlong: Into the center of the Ellis
street vehicle. Both cars were,crowd
ed. * The accident was probably due
to defective brakes on the cable car,
for according to statements made - by
the gxipman and eyewitnesses, the for
mer did his best to stop his car, but
the brakes refused . to work.. and the
collision followed. The Injured are:
David Robinson, 1396 Webster street,
compound fracture of the right ankle;
Frank Johnson, 1S13 \ Baker street and
Edna Courrier, 1736 Larkin street, both
shaken up; all passengers on the Lar
kin street car.
Intense excitemenj was caused by the
accident and a few minutes after the
crash the streets were lined with peo
ple. Fully 2000 gathered on the scene.
Patrolmen â¢ were dispatched from all
parts of the city and the large squad
of reserve officers was kept busy for
an hour keeping back the crowds. A
detachment of the Signal corps of thu
National Guard happened along short
ly after the accident and did good
work in keeping order.
The Ellis street car was on Its way
down town and carried fully 100 pas
sengers. The Larkin ' street car was
south bound and was loaded with peo
ple on their way to the drill of the
Knights Templar at the Mechanics 1 .
Pavilion. It is estimated that at least
150 persons were / on the car at tht?
time. Many were thrown to the ground
and others saved themselves by jump
ing before the crash 'came.*
More than a score of persons miracu
lously escaped instant death in. a col
lision last evening between car 1314
of the Ellis and O'Farrpll street elec
tric line and dummy, 28 of the Polk
and Larkin street cable line at Ellis

shaken up.' /s .'
