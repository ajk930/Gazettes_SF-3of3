time. It would be difficult, but burg
laries are not usually committed .from
a bath chair, and for . the â¢ rest I put
my ta'/a in Dr. Theobald. Meanwhile
Ruffles had at least withdrawn from the
balcony, and now I could only see his
head as he peered Into a cabinet at the
other side of the room. : It was like the
opera of "Alda," 'in which two scenes
art* enacted simultaneously, one In the
dungeon below,* the other In the temple
above. In the same fashion my atten
tion now became divjded between â¢ the
picture *>t Raines moving stealthily about
the upnjr.i room and that of the husband
and wife 'at .table underneath. -And al|
at once; -V the man replenished his glass
with n shrug of the shoulders, the woman
pushed back her chair and sailed to the
door. --
Raffles was standing before the fire
plate upstairs. He had taken one of .the
framed* photographs from the .chimney
piece and was scanning \u25a0it at suicidal
length through the eye holes in the.
hideous mask : which he still . wore. lie
would need It after all. The lady had
left the room below, opening. and . shut
ting the door for herself;: the man was
tilling his glasy! once more. I would have
shrieked my warning to Raffles, so fa
tally engrossed overhead, but at" this
moment (of all others) a constable (of
all men) was marching, sedately down
our side of the *quare. There was noth-Â»
ing for It but to turn a melancholy eye
upon the bath chair and to ask the con
stable-the time. I was evidently to-be,
kept there all night, I remarked, and
only realized with the . words that they
disposed of my other, explanation before
they were uttered. It was a horrible J
moment for such a discovery. â¢â¢ Fortun
ately the enemy was, on the , .pavemen.tr!.
from which he could scarcely have seen .
more than the drawing-room. ceiling .had;
he. looked., but he was not many houses
distant when a door opened and a woman,
gasped so that I heard both across!the
road. And never shall I forget, the sub- t
sequent tableaux ,in the lighted Vv room :
behind the low balcony and the French
windows. . . ' \u25a0
Raffles stood confronted by a .-.dark
and liaiidsome woman, whoso profile as
I saw it flrsttin the. electric. light; is cut \u25a0
like a cameo in my memory. I: It had the
. undeviatlngr line of brow: and. nose, the
short upper Up, the perfect -chln, s that
1 are united in. marble of tener thanjnlthe i
,â¢ flesh," and*-llke g marble '-.'she' ; stood,v, or ,
rather ' like" some' beautiful : pale ! bronze,
for tliat wns' her coloring,, arid she had
lost none of it that I <*oulcT see, neither
\u25a0.trembled,- but. her .bosom, roso.. arid fell,
\u25a0 and that was all., So she stood without
flinching before a masked ruffian,; who *
folt would be the first. to approelate her'
courage; to- me it-was. 30 supefrb that I
could think of it In. this way even then.
-and marvel how. Raffles himself .' could
stunt] u lmbashecl before so .brave a fig
ure. , He,:had, not to do so. long. . The
woman scorned him, and. he-stood, un
moved, a framed photograph' still. In his
-hand.' Thon. with a quick, 'determined
movement she turned,., not. to tlie door
oiv.lo tltc'jbell, but to the open .window
by which Raffles had entered, and, this
with that accursed, policeman, still, ju
view. . So far 'np word* had'. passed, be

\u25a0 Then they stood gazing at each other.;
â¢neither,. unmoved any more,- and whjlo
they ;Â«tood the; street-door- opened, nnd ;

Â» Thejr ;. heads . showed . f or .tan l .'instant* in

"ly as a boy 'does wine, and are about as
dangerous. I don't call Jacques Salllard
clever outside her art. but neither do I
call her a woman at all. She does man's
work over a man's name, has the will
: of any 'ten men I ever kn w, and I don't
mind telling you that I fear her more
than any person on God's earth. I broke
. with her once," said Raffles grimly.
'"but'l-know her. If I had been asked
â¢to: name the one person In London by
whom I was keenest not to be bowled
out, I should have named Jacques .Sall
lard.".
That -he had never before named her to
"me -was as characteristic as the reticence
with which Raffles spoke of their past
relations, and even of their conversa
tion In the back drawing-room that eve
ning; it 'was a question of principle with
him. and one that I like to remember.
'"Never glve-'a woman away, Bunny,"
he used t% Bay; and he said It again to
night, but with a heavy cloud upon h.lm.
as though his chivalry was sorely tried.
"That's all right," said I, "if you're
going to be given. away yourself."
5 "That's Just it. Bunny! That's just"
The words were' out of him. It was too
late to recall them. I had hit the nail
upon the head.
â¢'So she threatened you," I said, "did
she?"
"I. didn't say so." he replied coldly.
"And she is mated with a clown!" I
pursued. â¢-
â¢'How she-evcr. married him." he admit
ted, "is a mystery to me." y
"It always is." said. I. the wise man for
once, and rather enjoying the role.
VSoiithern blood?"
"Spanish." \u25a0
"She'll be pestering you to run off with
her, did chau," said I. .
Raffles was pacing the room. He
stopped in his stride for half a second.
So she had begun pestering him already!
It is wonderful how acute uny fool. can
be In the affairs of his- friend. But Raf
ties resumed his N walk without a syl
lable, and 1 retreated to safer srounO.
"So you sent her to Earl's. Court." I
mused aloud, and at last he smiled.
"You'll be interested to hear, Bunny,"
said he, ythnt I'm now living In Seven
~< Dials, and BUI Sykes couldn't hold n
' farthing dip to me,. Bless you, she had
my old police record Â«t her fingers' tnds.
-but it -was fit to; frame compared with

for me. -You: should have heard me beg

. "It was' necessary,' and that, had Us
"Then don't you wait!"'
It was like hfm to leave me like
rliat. and this time I had taken him at
his last word, had not my own given
me an idea. Mad I had called him, anil
mad I could declare him under oath if
necessary. It was not as though the
i hins had happened far from home.
They could Icurn all about us at the
nearest mansions. I referred them to
Ur. Theobald: this was a Mr. Maturln.
ime of his patients, and I was his keep
er and he had never given me the slip
before. 1 heard myself making these
explanations on the doorstep, and
pointing to the deserted bath chair as
the proÂ«f. -while the pretty parlor maid
i an for the police. It would be a more
serkjus matter for me than for my
< hargo. I should lose my place. No.
lie l.ad never done such a thing before.
and I woulti answer for it that he never
rhould cgain.
I raw myself conducting Raffles back
10 his chair with a firm hand and a
stern tongue. I heard him thanking
me In whispers on the way home. It
would be the first tight place I had
ever got him out of. and I was quite
anxious for him to get Into it. so sure
was I of every move. My whole posi
tiyn had altered in the few seconds
ih.it it took me to follow this illumln
;iting: train of ideas; It was now so
strong that I rould watch Raffles with
_out much anxiety. And he was worth
Matching.
He h.ul stepped boldly but softly to
t'.ie front door, and there he was still
waiting ready to ring if the door
opened or a face appeared in the area,
mid doubtless to pretend that he had
rung already. But he had not to ring
lat ill: and suddenly I saw his foot In
tli^ letter-box, his left hand on the lin
icl overhead. It was thrilling, even to
a hardened accomplice with an explan
ation up his sleeve! A tight grip with
thai left hand of his, as he leaned for
ward with all his weight upon thoso
Ove finjrorfi: a right arm stretched out
ward Mid upward to It 3 last inch, mid
the bast, of th<Â» low, projecting balcony

I looked down and took breath. The
maid was removing the crumbs in the'
lighted room, and the square was
empty as before. What a blessing it
Â«ras the end of the season! Many pf
llie houses remained in darkness. I
looked up again and Raffles was draw
ing hJs lcft'l<?g over the balcony rail
ing ' In another moment he had dis
appeared through ono of the French
windows which opened "upon the bal
cony, and in yet knottier he had
switched on the electric light within.
This': was bad enough, for. now I at
least could sco everything he did; but
the crowning folly was still to come.
There -was no r>olnt in it; the mad
thins was done for my benefit, as ... I
knew at once and he afterward con
fessed, but the lunatic, reappeared on
tbe balcony, bowing like a mountebank
âIn his crape mask! . , :
I set oft with the empty chair, but I
came back. I- could: not desert old
Raffles even when I would, but must
try to \u25a0 explain away. , his - mask \u25a0as well,
If he had not the sense to take it off in
â¢"tine's going to let down the blind!"
\u25a0whispered Raffles in high excitement.
No. confound them, they've told her
not to. Mark down her necklace.
Bunny, and invoice his stud. What a
brine he looks! But I like the table,
and that's her show. She has taste,
but he must have money. See the fes
tive picture over the sideboard? Looks
vj me like Jacques Saillard. But the
silver table would be good enough for
me."
"Get on," said I. "You're in a bath
chair."
"But the whole square's at dinner.
We should have the ball at our feet. It
\u25a0wouldn't take two twos!"
"With those blinds up and the
kitchen underneath?"
He nodded, leaning forward in the
chair, his hands upon the wraps about
his legs. V" 1 '
"You must be mad," said I, and got
back to my handles with the word, but
when I tugged the chair ran light.
"Keep an eye on the rug," came in a
whisper from tSie middle of the road,
:m<3 there stood my invalid, his pale
face in a quiver of pure mischief, yet
tot witli his insane resolve. "I'm only
PToiiig' to sec whether that woman has
a silver table"
"We don't want it"
"It won't take a minute"
"â¢Jfs madness, madness"
THE square shall be nameless, but
If you drive due west from Pidca
dilly the cabman will eventually
find It on his left, and he ought,
to thank you for two shillings.
It is not a fashionable square, but
there are few with a finer garden,
while the studios on the south side
lend distinction of another sort. The
houses, however, are small and dingy,
and about the last to attract the ex
pert practitioner in search of a crib.
Heaven knows it was with no such
thought I trailed Raffles thither, one
unlucky evening, at. tlie latter end of
that same season, when Dr. Theobald
had at last insisted upon the bath chair
which I had foreseen In the beginning.
Trees whispered in the green garden
aforesaid, and the cool smooth lawns
looked so inviting that I wondered
whether some philanthropic resident
<ould not be Induced to lend us the
key. But Raffles would not listen to
the suggestion, when I stopped to
make it, and what was worse, I found
him looking wistfully at the little
houses instead.
"Such balconies. Bunny! A leg up,
and there you would tie!"
I expressed a conviction that there
would be nothing worth taking in the
square, but took care to have him un
der way again as I spoke.
"I daresay you're right," sighed Raf
fles. "Rings and watches, I suppose,
but it would be hard luck to take
them from people who live in houses
like these. I don't know, though.
Here's one with an extra story. Stop.
Bunny; if you don't stop I'll hold on to
the railings! This is a good house;
look at the knocker and the electric
bell. They've had that put in. There's
oorae money here, my rabbit! I dare
bet there's a silver table in the draw
ing-room; and the windows are wide
open. Electric light, too. by Jove!"
Since stop I must, 1 had done so on
the other side of the road, in the
shadow of the leafy palings, and as
Raffles spoke the ground floor windows
opposite had flown alight, showing as
pretty little dinner table as one could
wish to see. with a man at his wine at
the far end, and the back of a lady In
evening dress toward us. It was like a
lantern picture thrown upon a screen.
There were only a pair of them, but
tiic table was brilliant with silver and
gay with flowers, and the maid waited
with the indefinable air of a good ser
\ant. It certainly seemed a good house.

effect. She let me so. But at the last
moment she said she didn't believe . I
was so black as I painted, myself, and
then there was the balcony scene you
missed." \u25a0'\u25a0'â¢: \u25a0
So that was all. I could not help
telling: him that he had grot oat of It
better than he deserved for ever get
ting, in. Next moment I regretted the
remark.
"If I have sot out of it." said Raffles
doubtfully, *:we are dreadfully near
neighbors, and I can't mov* in a min
ute, with old Theobald taking a grave
view of my case. 1 suppose I had bÂ«t- ;
ter lie low, and thank the gods again
for putting: her off the scent for the
time being."
No doubt our conversation was car
ried beyond this point, but it certainly
was- not. many minutes later, nor had
we left the subject, when the electric
bell thrilled us both to a sudden si
lence.
"The doctor?" I queried, hope fight
ing with horror.
"It was a single ring:.'* *
"The last post?" J\\*
"You know he knocks, and it's long
past his time." .r*.-.\-
The electric bell rang again, but now
as though it never would stop.
"You go,. Bunny." said Ra files, with
decision. His eyes were sparkling. His
smile was firm.
"What am I to say?"
"If it's the lady let her in."
It was the- lady, still in her evening
cloak, with her fine dark head half hid
den by the hood, and an engaging con
tempt of appearances upon her angry
face. She was even handsomer than
had thought, and her beauty of a bottle lW
type, but she was also angrier than V
had anticipated when I came so read
ily to thft door. The passage into which
it opened was an exceedingly narrow
one, as I have often said, but I never
dreamed of barring this woman's way.
though not a word did she stoop to say
to me. I was only too glad to flatten
myself against the wall, as the rust
ling fury strode past me into the light
ed room with the open door.
"So this is your thieves* kitchen!" she
cried, in high-pitched scorn.
I was on the threshold myself, and Baf
fles glanced toward me with raised eye
brows. '
"I have certainly had better quarters in
my day." said he. "but you need not call
them absurd names before my man."
- "Then send your 'man* about his busi
ness," said Jacque3 Salllard, with an un
pleasant stress upon the word indicated. ,
But when the door was shut I heard*
Raffles assuring her that. I knew noth^
ing, that he was a real Invalid over
come by a sudden mad temptation, and
all he had told her of his life a lie to
hide his whereabouts, but all he was tell
ing her bow she could prove for herself
without leaving that building. It seemed,
however, that she had proved it already
by going first to the porter below stairs.
Yet T do not think she cared one atom
which story was the truth. J
"So you thought I could pas* you in
your chair," she said, "or ever in this
world again, without hearing from my
heart that it was you."
11.
"Bunny." said Raffles. "I'm awfully
sorry, old chap, but you've got to go."
It was some weeks since the first un
timely visitation of Jacques Salllard, but
there had been many others at all hours
\u25a0at the day, while Raffles had been in
duced to pay at least one to her studio
In ,the neighboring square. These lptru
slons he had'endured at first with an air
of humorous' resignation" which imposed
upon me less than he imagined. The wo
man meant- well, he said after all, and
could be trusted to keep his secret loy
ally. It was plain to me, however., that
Raffles did not trust her. and that his
pretense upon the point was a. deliberate
pose to conceal the extent to which she
had him. in her power. Otherwise there
would have been little point In hiding
anything from the one person In pos
session of the cardinal secret of his iden
tity. But Rafflea thought it worth his
while to hoodwink Jacques Salllard in
the subsidiary matter of bis health. In
which Dr. Theobold lent him unwitting
assistance, and. as we have seen, to Im
press upon her that I was actually his
attendant, and as ignorant of his past
as the doctor himself. "3o you're all
right. Bunny." he had assured raa; "she
thinks you knew nothing the other ntg^.
I told you she wasn't a clever wom^bi
outside of her work. But hasn't she a
will!" I. told Raffles It was very con
siderate of him to keep me out of it.
but that It seemed to me like tying up
the bag when the cafe had escaped. His
reply was an admission that one must be
on the. defensive with sucn a woman and
in such a case. Soon after this. Raffles,
looking far from well, fell back upo 4^
his own last line of defense, namely his
bed; and now, as always 'in the. end. I
could see some sense In his subtleties.
since It was comparatively easy forÂ«ne to
turn even Jacques Saillard from the door.

brought all this trouble to pass, but a

it had occurred to him before our

LOOKING back upon a heated dis
cussion or a stubborn argument.
In cooler , moments, people are
often astonished that they wasted
so much time and strength in try
ing to have the last word. A man con
vinced ajeainst blÂ» will Is of the same
opinion still, and In nine cases out of ten
domestic dissension* result in discomfort
all around, simply because both parties
are determined to have their own way.
The last word Is not always a pleasant
word nor a wise one. It takes no little
Mlf-controi to leave the advantage with
the opposite side, yet many a time we are
grateful If they have the pood cense to
forego continued speech and take refuge
la silence. This is sure to be true If we
argue on politics. They are too dangerous
to be admitted into family talk.
Home happiness is a chain that Is strong
cr weak, according as It Is measured, by
the strain each separate link will bear.
If there is a weak place anywhere, then
one may say goo<l-by to peace, and hap
piness Is more dependent on peace than
oa anything else. It cannot flourish In an
atmosphere of strife and contention. This
is why I would exclude politics, unless all
feel alike about men and Issues.
We need not limit the "last word" to
disputes and squabbles. In household
management there arise frequent occa
sions for settling questions of importance,
In which no two of the family take pre
cisely the came view, and yet In which
there may be complete amiability and a
deference to the wishes of others that re
move the discussions from anything like
wrangling. For example, when the ques
tion is of choosing a profession for the
boy or a school for the girl, or of selling
a favorite horse or introducing another
dog into a house where everybody does
not equally like dogs. There may be hon
est distaste and aversion or honest desire
and affection, or there may be a fore-
thought which looks far ahead, or a su
perriclal view which sees only to-morrow.
In any case, about the Bchool, the horse
or the dog. the last word is the decisive
one, and it is uttered presumably by. the
one who sees furthest and is most-unself-'
Ish and considerate.
Otherwise, the last word Is that of a
tyrant, and tyranny", is fatal to home
enjoyment. Tyranny strikes a blow at'
the life of the household and makes
quiet living Impossible in that environ
ment. Just as In "Dombey. and Son,'*
the despotism of the elder Dombey was
a withering and scorching blast within
the doors of his miscalled home, so
despotism anywhere works mischief
thÂ£.t cannot.be repaired.

I knew a man whose foible it was
that he must have the final word about
everything. Beyond his own gates he
was a fairly good citizen, a man ! of
strict Integrity, and a reputable mer
chant. Once he had turned his latch-,
key In the door, his ' whole nature, and;
certainly his manners underwent an
extraordinary transformation. He'
wanted to adjust everything In sight.
He prowled about the kitchen, peering,
into the pots and pans,' and driving theÂ»
cook to distraction. He crept furtively,
around the drawing-room, touching a
finger here and there, to see, If possibly
a -little, dust might have settled on the
furniture, and scanning the corners of
the ceiling above and the floor. below
with inquisitive eyes, in the apparent
hope that a cobweb In one place op a
crumb on the other might give him an
opportunity for criticism. .. ,
The* length of his daughters' frocks,
the color of their hair ribbons, the style
of their shoes and every trifle in their
conduct alike came under his Incessant
fault-finding. Now and then, he took
up a fad with extraordinary Insistence,"
and while the fit lasted woe be to the
family if they ventured to disagree,
with him. Once I remember he took It
Into his head to regard common table
salt as a most virulent poison. No salt
was permitted In seasoning, no salt was
allowed on the table, no salt was ad
mitted within the pantry door. An un
fortunate guest, looking vainly around
the table, inquired for salt. "Madam,"
he said, "I would as soon give you ar- .
senic." .A son of the house ventured
to ask for it, and was ' summarily sent
to Led:
At another time, the same good man
had a fancy .that all nutrition ' and
every possible requirement, for physical
growth were folded up In tho little
compass of a*limaÂ«bean. for
some time the family breakfasted, din
ed and supped almost exclusively > on
lima beans as an article of diet. \u25a0-,
"Why in the world," said a kinswo
man, "do you all give up to Harold in
so'absurd a fashion? Life is not worth
living at- the price you have to pay
for it." \u25a0 "
"The truth of the matter Is," said the
person addressed, '"that Harold is so
set upon having**the last word that we
do. anything for the sake of peace and
quietness." ' \u25a0 . -
1 Hero was an extraordinary; lnstance
of the ! folly and futility of paying too
dearly for peace. A little war would
have been preferable. . -
People Who go about with long faces,
who yield to the blues, who are crabbed
and perverse, have a good deal to an
swer. , for. They lessen the sum of
pleasure In the world. They make
other, people sad and give the right of
way to melancholy, and dim the bright
ness of the daily path. In a girl's al
bum the other day I saw this stanza:
Just ''as a Dlace to Hv< In
This old world is hard to beat.
There Is a thorn for every rose.
-But aren't the roses sweet? â¢/â¢,;,
That is'tho sort of "last word" which
we should be all the time saying. There
is little -danger that we shall not be
sufficiently serious. . Sobriety Is in our

us by our circumstances, and we can
not always be jolly.. Yet there is no
need that we should go about dragging
on our feet the: ball and chain of irri

proper place and' time as solemnity. .
Hjalmar Boyesen, the Norwegian
poet, wrote an enchanting little lyric
all about a girl 'who was called; the '.
Briar Rose. She went dancing through
the days, and when the other- maidens
were milking the cows or spinning, she
was Idle. Everybody condemned her, .

She seemed as frivolous as a butterfly, â¢
but there came a day when there was
a chance for an act of timely heroism,

sacrificed herself and saved the town. ' ;

ITAKE ; it for â¢ granted that most
young girls would like to know how
to cook. A few years ago I would
have. been sure that all girls. desired
to know everything they could about
this useful and necessary "art of woman's
work. But' "l found in connection with
classes Th social settlements /-that girls
who had been working hard all day in
shops and factories did not T take . much
interest in the evening in a ' chafing dish
or a stove or any thing .connected with the
kitchen.. They told me that they were too
tired to enjoy. this sort of work, and that
it was a greater rest and refreshment to
them, to! take up studies ; connected with
books or toVdo something which would
help them .in making .their clothes.
To-day I . atn writing for . school girls,
and I feel quite sure that they sometimes
enjoy, dropping 'their books and ' taking
hold of one of the most practical employ
ments in life. "When you think of .it,
nothing is more practical than: the proper
preparation of dally food.- What .to eat,
how to ;cook It and" how.-. to . serve It are'
departments which no woman can" afford
to neglect. *. .. â¢â¢\u25a0â¢:â¢' â¢ :. . '"

digestion, ill-temper and 111-health. r A
great deal of food In . this dear country
oC ours Is" ruined In the' cooking.. With the
finest markets In the world, with plenty
of everything brought to our; doors,~,we
waste and destroy and throw away food
which in other countries, where \ people
are more economical, Is used, to -"-the best
advantage, "and then' we. wonder why we
continue poor. ; We might as well wonder;
why we ara' often plain when we might
be beautiful, and cross when we might be
amiable, and out of spirits when "we
should be calm and tranquil. "Our. foolish
extravagance and \u25a0 Inexcusable ignorance

pf course, . everyâ girl wants to be at
tractive in appearance, to have bright
eyes, asmootli. skin, and "a look of vi
tality. ..No. girl will be beautiful or
have anything else than a sallow, skin,
ugly pimples and dull eyes, if she hab
itually eats poorly cooked food. There:
is, for instance," a widespread prejudice
against hot-blsoults and coffee. Soggy
biscuits and muddy coffee are enough
to 'poison whoever touches them, but
when biscuits are light as puffs, and
coffee Is clear as amber, both are in
nocuous to people In health. Every girl
should learn how to make light bis
cuits and clear, coffee, and this part
of her education Is Just as important as
her arithmetic,. : her grammar, . her
French, her German, her ' geometry or
any one of the numerous 'branches in
sclence_which now occupy the attention
of girls. ,
The best cooking 1 school any girl can
haveis her mother's kitchen, provided
her mother knx>ws how to cook., Noth
ing erse;equal3 the opportunity one has
just' there/' Three meals a day are. set
upon the table In most houses. The fa
ther com^s home tired " after a day's
work, : the growing boys are always
hungry, and the children .may be de

tea- for. mother, when she has a head
acKe, yet I "know any number of girls
whose toast.'isa scorched, messy look
ing affair, and whose tea is not fit to
drink. . " .
A -girl . at home? should take pains
about these simple -everyday things.
She. should learn how to broil steak
and chops,' how -to cook potatoes in
many delicious ways,, hdw to prepare
salads in a variety which Is legion.
Little by little; if a girl Is Interested,
she may acquire the art of cooking
well at home, and especially she should
learn how to make a good loaf of bread.
Dear girls, believe me that until you
have really tried to ido this you do not
know what .an accomplishment . it is.
and how much care and trouble must
be taken before you can know the right
quantity of flour. and the right quantity
of: yeast and the length of time to be
spent In kneading the bread and In let
ting If rise, nor have you the least Idea
about the temperature of the oven.- In
the South, where bread is made in per
fectioh'".! have'known the cook to go
downstairs in the middle of the night
tnnt she might' see how her bread was
coming. on. â¢ This is not riecessary. and
yÂ«t bread -Will 'not brook neglect.- It
must. be carefully watched, and every
step of the process must receive Intelli
gent care. Good cooking demands as
niu.ch thought as any other good thing
hi the universe.
An artist cannot paint .*. picture, nor.
for that matter, can a house painter
decorate a house without taking pains.
As much thought and skill and dexter
ity go into a loaf of bread as Into thÂ»
molding of a statue or the weaving of
tapestry or the writing of poetry.
Whatever else may be slighted, bread"
requires conformity to rule. You hayÂ»
heard old-fashioned housekeepers de
clare, that they were Independent of
rules, that they mads things by using
their judgment, and truly to look at
them as they work one would think
this so; a pinch of one thing, a sprinkle
of another, a handful of a third, a few
ingredients airily tossed together, a
few magical passes, and out comes tha
souffle or the pudding or tho dumpling:
light as foam, browned to perfection,
with the delicato flavor that a chef
might envy. But these good cooks, al
though they do not own It, probably
automatically adhere to rules. Ther*
is some rule that they observe, and fol
lowing: this they act with a precision
which- (Iocs not need weighing and
measuring. Most of us set on better If
we keco to the rule.
A good cook book with plain direc
tions, absolutely followed. Is a friend
worth having in tho house.
The advantage of cooking schools for
girls is largely found In the fact that
the girls there learn a good deal of tha
chemistry of cooklnsr. They are told
the why and the wherefore. They not
only, acquire deftness of touch, but
they learn which dishes may be served
together, and how to make the most
of small portions. The success of a
meal depends on good catering, on
serving^the right things. In the right
order, at the right time. Good house
keeping means a wise and discreet se
lection of provisions. Each young girl
should learn how to market, how to
cater and how t*o cook and then when,
she grows up she will be her mother's
capable helper, and should she marry
she will make a good wife, either for
a poor man or a rich man. just as it
happens. 'â¢
There 13 fun In studying cooking In
a class. A half-doxen girls get more
1 leriEitre out of the work than a sin
gle jrlrl can when studying by herself.
Additional pleasure comes from eat
ing what has been cooked, at the
close of the lesson. There is a great
deal of pleasure, too. In issuing invi
tations to honored guests at the end
of a. season, surprising them with a
fi<ie dinner or a dainty supper served
in a style of which Delmonlco might
be iiroud.

ny, in a woman with the devil's own
will."
Raffles tore ur> the letter from which
he had read these ; piquant extracts,
and lay back on the pillow with the
tired air of the veritable Invalid which
fcÂ»j seemed able to assume at will. . But
for once he did look as though bed was
the best place for him; and 1 used the
fact as an argument for my own re
tention in defiance of Dr. Theobald.
The town was full of typhoid, I said,
and certainly that autumnal scourge
was in the air. Did he want mft to
leave him at the very moment when lie
might be sickening for a serious ill
ness? â
"You know I don't, my good fellow,
said Raffles wearily; "but Theobald
does, and I can't afford to go against
him now. Not that I really care what
happens to me now that that woman
knows I'm in the land of the living;
she'll let it out, to a dead certainty,
and at the best there'll be a hue and
cry, -which is the very thing I have
escaped all these years. Now, what I
want you to do is to go and take some
quiet place somewhere, and then let me
know, so that I may have a port In
the storm when it breaks."
"Now you're talking!" I cried, recov
lng my spirits. "I thought you meant
to go and drop a fellow altogether!"
"Exactly the sort of thing you would
think." rejoined -Raffles with a con
tempt that was welcome enough after
my late alarm. "No. my dear rabbit,
what you've got to do is to make a
new burrow for us both. Try down the
Thames, In tome quiet nook that a
literary man would naturally select.
Tve often thought that more use might
be made of a boat, while the family
arÂ« at dinner, than there ever has been
yet. If Raffles is to come to life, old
chap, ho shall go a-Raffling for all he's
worth! There's something to be done
with a bicycle, too. Try Ham Com
mon or Roeharnpton, or some sleepy
hollow a trifle off the line: and say
you're expecting your brother from the
colonies."
Into this arrangement I entered with
out the slightest hesitation, for we had
funds enough to carry it out oft a com
fortable scale, and Raffles placed a suf
ficient share at my disposal for the
nonce. Moreover, I for one was only
too glad to seek fresh fields and pas
tures new â a phrase which I deter
mined to interpret literally in ray
choice of fresh surroundings. I was
tired of our submerged life In the poky
little flat, especially now that we had
money enough for better things. I my
seif had of late had dark dealings with
the receivers, with the result that poor
Lord Ernest Belville's successes were
now indeed ours. Subsequent compli
cations had been the more galling on
tbat account, while the' wanton way In
which they had been created was the
most Irritating reflection of all. But
Jt had brought Its own punishment upon
Raffles, and I fancied the lesson would
prove salutary when we again settled
down.
"If over we do. Bunny!" said he, as 1
took hi 3 hand and told him how I was
already looking forward to the time.
"But of course we will," I cried, con
cealing' the resentment at leaving him
which his tone and his appearance re
newed In my breasL
"I'm not so sure of it," he said,
gloomily. "I'm in somebody's clutches,
and I've got to get out of them first."
"I'll sit tight until you do." .
"WcJS," he said, "if you don't see me
in ten days you never will."
"Only ten days?" I .echoed. "That's
nothing- at all."
"A "lot may happen in ten days," re
plied Raffles, In the same depressing tone,
so depressing in him; and with that he
held out his hand a second time, and
dropped mine suddenly after as sudden
a pressure for farewell. \ , â¢.
I left the flat in considerable dejec
tion after all, unable to decide whether
Raffles was really, ill. or only worried,, as
I knew him to be. And at the foot of
the stairs the author of . my "dismissal,
that confounded Theobald, flung open his
door and waylaid . me.' ," . ,.-.- \u25a0 ' ' . "j .' -.J& : ,';* ;
"Are you going?" '-ttV demanded. -.T"* |
The traps in my hands proclaimed' that :
I was, but I dropped them at ; his feet
to have it out with him then, and there.
"Yes," I answered fiercely, "thanks to
you!" r
"Well, my good fellow," he said, his
full-blooded fac^ lightening and soften
ing at the same time, as though a load
were off bis mind, "It's no pleasure to
me to deprive any man of his billet, Jjut
you'never were a nurse' and you know
that as well as I do."
' I began to wonder what he meant, and
how much he did know, and my specu
lations kept me silent. "But come in
here a moment." he continued,, just as
I decided that he knew nothing at all.
And. leading me Into his minute con
sulting room, Dr. Theobald, solemnly pre
sented me with a sovereign by way of
compensation, which I pocketed solemn
ly, and with as much gratitude as If
I had not fifty of them distributed over
my person as It was. The good fellow
had quite forgotten my social status
about which he himself had been so
particular at our earliest Interview, but
he had never accustomed himself to treat
me as a gentleman, and I do not sup
pose he had been improving his memory
by the tall tumbler which I saw him
poke behind a photograph frame as we
entered.
"There's one thing I should like to
know before I go," said I, turning sud
denly on the doctor's mat, "and that Is
\u25a0whether Mr. Maturln is really ill or
not!" \u25a0
I meant, of course, at the present.mo
ment, but Dr. Theobald braced himself
like a recruit at the drill sergeant's
voice.
- "OX course he is," he snappedâ "so
ill as to need a nurse who can nurse
by way of a change."
With that his door shut In mv face,
and I had to go my way In the dark as
to whether he had mistake^ my mean
ing and was telling me a lieor not.
But for my misgivings upon this
point I might have extracted some
very genuine enjoyment out of the
next few days. I had decent clothes to
my back, with money, as I say, in' most
of the pockets, and more freedom jto
spend it than was possible- in the con
stant society of a jnan whose personal
liberty depended on .1 universal suppo
sition that he'was dead. Raffles was as
bold as ever, and I as fond of him, but
whereas lie would run any risk In a
professional exploit. thÂ«re were many
innocent recreations still open to me
which would have been sheer madness
in hlrn. " He could not evexi watch a
match from the 6-penny seats at I^ordls
cricket ground, when the gentlemen
\u25a0were every yenr in a worse way. with
out him. He never traveled by rail,
and dining out was a risk only to be
run with some ulterior object in view.
In fact, much as it had changed. Raf
fles could not longer show his face with
perfect impunity in any quarter or at
any hour. Moreover, after /the lesson
he htfa now learned. I foresaw, in
creased caution on his part. ln this re
spect. But I myself. was under nosuch
perpetual disadvantage, and, while, what
was good enough for' Raffles was (fuite.
good enough for me. so long. as were
together, I saw no harm inproflting by
the present opportunity of "doing my
self well."* j>". "'.'.>.'.'- .
Such were my reflections. on the way'
to Richmond In a hansom cab. \u25a0 Rich
mond had struck us both as. the best,
center of. operations. In search, of -the

and by road. In. a well appointed,' well.
selected hansom, was certainly the '
\u25a0 - - \u25a0 \u25a0.-;.-.-
most agreeable way of getting there.
In a week'or ten .days; Raffles was to
write to me. at the Richmond, postofflce,
but . for at least a .-week I shoujd \u25a0be
"on- my "own." It was not an unpleas

to _ the', striking < :st of 'countenHiice or.
to the peculiar charm' of expression
which made the face of Raffles like no
other in the world. But this very dis
tinction was in Itself a danger, for, its
Impression -was Indelible.", whereas =-I.
might still have, been 'mistaken., for a

believe that the evil which I did lf.id

This afternoon. Indeed. I v/as struck. by
tho purity of my fresh complexion, and
rather depressed by the general Inno
cence of the visage which peered. Into
mine from the little mirror. My straw
colored mustache, grown . In .the. flat
after a protracted holiday, again, pre
served the most disappointing dimen
sions, and was still Invisible. In, certain
lights without wax. So far from dis
cerning the desperate criminal who has
'done time" once, and deserved' lt over
ami over again, the superior but super
ficial observer might have imagined
'hat he detocteel a certain element of
folly In ray face.
At all events It was not the face' to shut
the doors of a first-class hotel against
me without accidental evidence of a more
explicit kind, and" it -was- with no -little
satisfaction that I directed the man to
drive to the Star and Garter.' I also told
him â¢ to go through Richmond ..Park,
though he warned me that It would add
considerably to the distance and his fare.
It was autumn, and it struck methat
the tints would be .fine. And .|_ had
learned from Raffles to appreciate such
things, even amid the excitement of an
audacious enterprise.
If I dwell. upon my appreciation of this
occasion it ' is because, like most pleas
ures, it was exceedingly short-lived. \u25a0 I
was very comfortable, at the Star and
Garter,; which was so empty' that. l had
a room worthy of a prince,, where I could
enjoy the finest of all views, (in patriotic
opinion)- every morning while -I shaved.
I walked many miles through the noble
park, over the commons of Ham and
Wimbledon, and one day. as far as that
of IHsher, where I was \u25a0forcibly reminded
of â¢ a scrvice-we once rendered; to a dis
tinguished resident in this delightful lo
cality;. But it was on Ham Common, one
of the places which Raffles had mentioned
as specially desirable; that. .1 actually
found an almost ideal retreat. . This was
a cottage where I heard, oh inquiry," that
rooms were to be--let in the surnmcr. The
landlady, a motherly body ot'vislble ex
cellence, was surprised indeed -at recelv-'
Ing an application for the winter months;
but I have generally found that the title
of . "author," claimed.; with, an air, ex
plains : every * little *' Innocent Irregularity

quires something of the kind to | carry
convictions to the lay intelligence. The
present case was one in point, and when
I said that licould only write In a. room

with a\ cold ham , in the "wardrobe In "case

"My good fellow, I was obliged to have

The doctor's tone was so conciliatory
that I remembered in an instant wiiat a

But it was to the truth itself more than

for many months. â¢'\u25a0'
I was still, stupefied by a .sense of
'Inconceivable loss nnd had not raised
my eyes from that .wlilch was slowly
forcing me. to realize what had hap
pened, when there was a rustle at my
elbow, and v shower* of hothouses flow
ers passed before them, falling like
'huge snowiiakes where my gaze had
rested. 1. looked up, and at my "side
stoti'J a. -majestic figure In deep mourn-
Ing. The face was carefully veiled, but
I- was ' too ; close Hot to recognize the
marterful ' beauty' whom the world
knew as Jacoues Saillard. I had no
sympathy for her; on the contrary,
my blood boiled with the vague con
viction that in some way she was ro
sponslble for his death. Yet she was
tho only woman present â there were
not half a doaen of us altogether â and
her flowers were tho only flowers.
The melancholy, ceremony was over,
and Jacques Saillr.nl had departed ' in
a funereal brougham, evidently hired
: for the occasion. I had watched her
drive away, and the sight of my own
, cabman making signs to .me through
the fog had suddenly reminded me that .
I had bidden him to wait. I was the
last to leave.. and had turned my back
upon the grave-diggers, .already at
their final task, when a hand fell light
ly but'firriily upon my shoulder. .
\u25a0 "I don t want to make r scene in a
'.cemetery," said a voice, -In a not un
kindly, almost confidential whisper.
"Will you get into yojir own cab and
come quietly?"
"Whovon earth are you?" I ex
cl.ilme'l. . â¢ -
I now remembered having seen the
fellow hovering about during the funeral,
and subconsciously taking him for the
undertaker's head man. He had certain
ly that appearance, and even now I could .
scarcely believe that he was anything
else.
"Jly name won't help you." he said
pityingly. "But you will guess where I
come from when I tell you I have a
warrant for your arrest." â¢ .'\u25a0
My sensations at this announcement.
' may not be believed, but I solemnly de
clare that I haye v seldt>m experienced so
fierce a satisfaction.. Here was a new
excitement in which to drown my grief;
here was something "to think about; and
I" should be spared the Intolerable ex
perience of a solitary return to the tittle
plr.ee at Ham. It was as though I had
lost- a limb and some, one had struck
me so hard In the face that the greater
agony was forgotten. I got Into the
hansom without a word, my captor fol
lowing at my heels, and giving his own
directions to the cabman before taking
his seat. The word . "station" was 'the
only one I caught, and I wondered whe
ther it .was to be Bow street again. My
companion's next woTds, however, or
rather the tone In which he .uttered
them, destroyed my capacity for Idle
speculation.'
"Mr. .Maturin!" said he. "Mr. Jla
turlnT Indeed!'.' "\u25a0'\u25a0''â¢.- -\u0084-. . \u25a0
"Well." said I. "what .about him?"
"Do you think we don't know who
he was?" ' \u25a0
"Who was he?" I asked defiantly.
'...\u25a0'.'"You 'ousht to' know.'.' said he. "you
got locked up through him the other
time, too. His favorite name "\u25a0 was Rat
ifies ; then." ' â¢' â¢ .
>Vlt was his real name," I said. Indig
â¢nantly. v " An <i he has been dead for
"years." \u25a0' ' '
My captor simply chuckled.
""â¢ "He's "at' the bottom 'of the sea, I tell
you!"
" But I do not know why I should have
told him with such spirit, for what could
It matter to Raffles now? I did not think;
instinct was still stronger than reason.
and," fresh from hl3 funeral. 1 had taken
up the cudgels for my dead friend as
though he were still alive, i Next mo
ment I saw this for myself, and my
tears came nearer the. surface than they
had been yet; but the fellow at my side
laughed outright.
"Shall I tell you something else?"
"As you like."
"He's not even at the bottom of that
grave! He's no more dead than you or
I. and a sham burial is his .latest piece
of villainy!"
I doubt whether I could have spoken
if I had tried. I did not try. I had
no use for speech. I did not even ask
him if be, was sure. I was so sure myself.
It was all as plain to me as rlddle3
usually are when one has the answer.
The doctor's alarms, his unscrupulous
venality, the simulated illness, my own
dismissal, each fitted in Its obvious place.,
and not even \be last had power as yjr
to mar my joy in the one central fact
â¢to which all the rest were as tapers to
the sun. -
"He Is alive"'* I cried. "Nothing else
matters â he is alive!"
At last I did ask whether they had
got him too; but -thankful as I was for
the greater knowledge. I confess that I
did not much care what answer 1 re
ceived. Already I was figuring out
how much we might each get. and how
old we should be when we came out.
But my companion, tilted his hat to the
back of his head, at the same time put
ting his face close to mine and com
pelling my scrutiny. And my answer,
as you have already guessed, was the
face of Rallies himself, superbly dis
guised tbut less superbly than his
voice), and yet so thinly that I should
have known him in a v trlce had I not
been to miserable in the beginning to
give him a second glance.
Jacques Saillard had made his life
impossible, and this was the one escape.
Raffles h*ad bought the doctor for Â£1000,
and the doctor had bought a "nurse"
of his own kidney, on his own account;
\u25a0me, for some reason, he would not
trust; he had Insisted upon my dis
missal as an essential preliminary to
his part in the conspiracy. Here the
details were half humorous, half grew
some. each in turn as Raffles told me
the story. At one period he had been
very daringly drugged indeed, and. In
his own words, "as dead as a man need
be." but he had left strict instructions
that nobody but the nurse and "my de*
voted physician" should "lay a finger on
me" afterward, and by virtue of this
proviso a. llbary of books (largely ac
quired for the occasion) had been Im
piously Interred at Kensal Green. Raf
fles had definitely undertaken not to
trust me with the secret and but for my
untoward appearance at the funeral
(which, he had attended for his own
final satisfaction). I was assured and
am convinced that he would have kept
his promise to the letter. In explain
ing this he gave me the one wxplana
tlon I desired, and In another moment
we turned into Praed street, Padding
ton.
"And I thought you said Bow street!*",
said I. "Are you coming straight down
to Richmond with me?" .
"I may -as well." said Raffles,
'.'though I did mean to get my kit first,
so as to start In fair and square as the
long-lost brother from the bush. That's
why I hadn't written. The function
was- a day later than I calculated. I
was going to write to-nJght!"
"But what are we to do?" said I,
hesitating .when he had paid the cab.
"I have been the colonies for
all they are "worth!" *
"Oh, ; I've lost my lug-gage." said he.
"or a wave came, into my cabin and
spoiled every stitch, or I had nothing
fit to bring ashore. We'll settle that
in the train."Keith Gordon

Then there is the low guard, .which
is the same for the rishtÂ»or left side.
The blow is taken on the heavy send.'
For a person to: strike â¢ low he must
step in. The moment the blow, is struck
you send the cane .upward and in almost
every case, you will reach the face.
Now for the holds. Supposing'yotir

quick step forward will bring the cane

your "hold. At rtae sanie time a- left
back-handcr will do the trick on .the

When your adversary tries to grab,
you the same upward movement can
be brought into play. Only this time
it 13 aimed at the point of the chin. It
is surprising how'slight a tap with a
ttick on this point will do the trick.
More than one person has taken the
count when this trick has been illus-
trated, the blow . seeming harply to.
touch the chin.
There arc times when the attack will
be made so suddenly or the opponent
will close in so. that the upward move

the : straight cross comes into play. You
give. your opponent the force of the
heavy eiid on the jaw. This, if it does
not put him oifC\will stagger him.
Then straighten ing out the arm the
second movement of the blow is given
which brings the ferrule end across the
other side of the' jaw. This will gen
erally be enough to d~op him./ If not.
it can be repeated and the next will
catch the point of the chin as his head
is turned.
A defense comes into play when at

on the -right a mere raising of the

Had he'seen It when it framed the low
forehead in so bewildering 'an ara

"You look rather swell yourself." she
laughed in response to his eloquent
glance of approval. "Knickers and
a I Norfolk cap and the jacket aren't
half bad on you. - Taken -In connection
with your cleft chin," she went on.
throwing her head back and screwing
up her eyes critically, "they make you
a very presentable youth indeed!"
"We won't talk" about that," was the
terse reply. "This walk to Point Bon
ita has an object!"
She opened ber eyes wide.
VCertainly." she assented politely.
"Point' Bonita. for instance. If it has
any other object," she went on stern
ly, "if you're going back' to that old
subject I won't ,go a step further."
By this. time they were moving in
the midst of a cloud.
It was his turn to be innocent.
"You meanâ oh!" with a fine imita
tion of impatience. "Doesn't a girl
ever forget it if a fellow has once hap
pened to fancy himself in love with
her and say so?" i
The pink of the girl's cheeks â it had
the soft, furred look that Is responsi
ble .for .the slang adjective "peachy,"
deepened suddenly, unaccountably. Ouf'
of the tail of his eye the youth ob
served this interesting- fact, with cruel
Klee. reflecting with a pang that he
should have chosen diplomacy as a .vo
cation instead of. engineerins.
"You should forgive and forget the sins
of ; my youth," he. resumed. VYou know
you Insisted that .you would -always be
the best of friendsâ and that's what I
need how!"
"You change' quickly enough, I must

' "Since what?" he challenged, but she
turned away and did 'not reply, while
the walls 'of mist lazily closed In nearer
and' nearer. : '-'
"What do you want" to tell me?" she
questioned at last in an oddly subdued
manner. He did not answer immediately,
but swung on, ahead of ber. in the nar
row path, as if he were making a way
for her through the mist. She felt a
shuddering sense of desolation. Still, she
argued, she'could scarcely have supposed
he would, go on caring, especially since
she had explained to him with judicial
carefulness that she ro^st marry a" man
with money, on account of her mother"
aad the younger girls.
Strangely enough, though she had pic
tured herself as married to another, there
had. always been' a somber, interesting
figure hovering in the background of that
picture-^one to .whom she meant to be
so kind, so gentle, so all-sweet that his
regret should become like a beautiful,
sad- songâ to be .wept overâ and - enjoyed.
And 'now;. -he 'brute -.was asking her to
"forgive and forget", that he had ever
told â¢ her that . he loved her!' - ;
They had reached the summit of a hill
and he' proposed that they sit-down upon
a '; convenient 'boulder to rest before at
tempting the next "one. Apparently her
silence was 'unnoticed.
"You* see. Fate's been telling off my
buttons lately," he began In a business
like tone, "and the decree Is that it ha 3
got 'to;be"money!"_ '_ -" Â» ; "
"What do you mean?"
.^ "Rich ~ woman, poor woman., beggar
woman,' squaw!" he elucidated, touching
the buttons orirhis. jacket, ."and the- lot Â£
falls to rich woman every time. It seems
l beastly thing to think â¢ ofâ marrying for
money. I would be a cad enough to do
it, but the thing is that there's a girlâ
a mighty fine girlâ and I reallyâ lâ bang
it, "I like her! But how am I to tell
whether it's the real thing or whether
her. money hag something to do with it?
You see. there are reasons why I should
have money, right away. long before 1
ta ga^n It bjÂ» ray o\|rh efforts.
The governor' is '"brcakrns dpwt*.and.his
affairs are In bad shape, and there are
the two kkl3 and mother to provide for."
The girl's heart was sinking as tha
mercury does In a falling temperature.
AH the joy of living seemed to be oozing
away through her finger tips, leaving her
cold and inert. He turned toward her
curiously.
"Of course, you don't think I'd consider
such a thing: if I were not farced to it
by duty!" he went on fervenUy. "And
I came to you because I thought you'd
understand, because circumstances are
forcing you into the same thing. They
say you're going to marry Bradsnaw.
You'll be a rich womanâ and a happy one.
I hopeâ but whether you are or not, you.
will have done your duty by. the family.
That will be your consolation, and that's
why I come to you In my difficulty. What
do you thinkâ can I decently ask the girt
to marry me? Remember. I like her, be^T
I'm not sure I love .her!" . *
The fog, which had seemed about to
crush them softly a few momenta be
fore, was now falling back, hut they
were still In a remote world. With thÂ»
very Bight of habitations cut off from
their view. It was hard to believe In the
reality of purple and fine linen, horses
and carriages and gold. â¢ Suddenly the
scales fell from tbe N girl's eyes, thoujh
she realized with a pang that it waÂ» too
late. She had put the only thins that
mattered out of her life, as thoughtlessly
and carelessly as she would toss a pebble
from her path. She had not even realized
what she was doing. Down below, where -
the Bradshaw fortune cast its glamour,
everything had looked different. She had
thought that with money all thinys el 3Â»
must fall into place. But here, cut ofT
from the world, the Bradshaw - wealth
seemed less than nothing, and love tha
only thing! .
Farther and farther thÂ« tog reached.
showing thin in spots, but still conceal
ing the valley beneath them. But shÂ»
was very sure now. Even when the
world assumed its old proportions It
would be the same. She had had her
lesson.' The peachblow tint was gone
from her cheeks, and her eyes were grava
and unglrlish as she spoke.
"I'm not going to marry Grant-Brad
shaw!" she said steadily, "nor any other
man whom I don't love. So you see I
can't help you- after all! I don't think
1 could ever really have meant to do
such a thingâ"
Her voice broke, and the eyes that
had been looking into his with a plead
ing stronger than any words suddenly
filled with tears.
"I'm such a silly!" she explained rath
er unevenly, "but I bate to be accus?dv*
of . such a thing. And I think you ouglvY
to be ashamed. Jack! You're a man. anaJ
you can make money for yourself andâ"
But he seemed to be paying .no atten
tion to her word 3. With deep absorption
he was naming the button? of her ! coat.

not accustomed to the play it is very
easy to strain them so that the hand

The reason for this grip is that It

The blow that does the most effectual
work is an upward or straight cross,
which Is struck with that portion of
the cane that is measured oft along the
elbow. It is started either by throwing
the hands upward or as if to strike a
blow, bringing the hand across the face
of the opponent.
The cane rests on the heel of the
hand and the force of the tjlow comes
from all the muscles and the full
weight of the body along the forearm.
The other biow is wnh the ferrule end
and is the blow ordinarily struck by
one if lie were hcldins the stick at the
end. V
Now that one has heard how to hold
a cane the next thlnr to be considered
Is how to put it into practice.
Take. for. instance, the ca*o .- of &

.J once remarked. "It is strange
I f how few men who carry a cana
' \~ are held up."
There is "something about a
good stout stick that commands respect.
From time to time articles have been
written about the proper use of the
walking stick in self-defense. In prac
tically every case the pupil has been
told to \u25a0wield his cane as he would a
sword. But once let his opponent, by
this method, gret a hand on the stick
he xr III have an enormous leverage by
which to disarm its wlelder. â¢
It is, however, to the Emerald Isle
that one must look to get instructions
on the wajs in which, the cane can be
most successfully brought into use as a
weapon of self-defense.
The \ivid literature of boyhood tells
how at the fairs at Donnybrook and
places as well known the fights of the
factions were the delight of the coun
tryside and the number of broken heads
the criterion of the fair's success. There
is more truth than fiction in some of
these accounts, for years ago the shille
lah played a most interesting part in
the country festivities.
By using a cane as a son of Ireland
would use a blackthorn you can put
nine out of every ten ruffians bent en
a holdup out of business. And before
they are aware you have commenced
to defend yourself.
The cane, when used this way. is far
preferable to cither the knife or pistol.
But to use the walking stick tuccess
fuily one must practice with it. Instead
of taking lessons with the foils, if you
are a member of any of the athletiG
clubs, try a light stick the length of a
cane. Put on the broadsword mask
and coat and a heavy glove to protect
the hand, then play "Donnybrook."
After a few weeks of this kind of
wcrk one will f.nd that he has acquired
a lightness and speed that are the per
fection of grace. For, in order to
successfully defend one's self under
this system he must keep perfect poise.
For outdoor use get a good stout
stick, or.c that has some weight and
can stand a battering. A good bit of
oak with tlie bark on Is tne best. Grip
the cane in the center, laying it along
the forearm. "With the left hand push
the cane through the right hand until
the Â«nd just extend* beyond the elbow,
which will give the right balance. It.
will be found that the other end, to
ward the ferrule, vill tÂ»e a little longer
than that measured off.
The only hold is with the thumb, in
dex ar.d center fingers. It is the same
rrip that is used with the foil. Never
grasp the cane with til the fingers, not
even for a straight blow. In this case
the third and little fingers are merely
held lightly around the cane to steady
it.

showed him my ; newly coined piece 3.
He was so condescendingly v pleased

burse his expens.es in the coin of the

_: The nqbles- followed' the example set
to them by the lavish Sir David. They
needed no urging from him to Increase
â¢their stakes. The fever of the gambler
was on 'each of them, and soon the al
leged Italian began to be embarrassed
in* keeping up the pace he had set for
himself.*'' It required now an enormous
sum'" to. pay even double the amount
taken at the : door. The necromancer
announced that the meetings would be

another, cried the Barons with some SB
show of reason. The conjurer had
conjured up a demon he could not eoorj||
trol; the demon of greed.
The only man about the court who -
seemed to know nothing of what -was
going forward was the King himself. ;
The French Embassador narrowly r,
watched his actions, but James .was*,
the same free-hearted, jovial, pleasure-^,
seeking monarch he had always been. ,*
He hunted and caroused, and was the ,-',
life of any party of pleasure which sal- | ,
lied forth from the castle. He disap-M
peared now and then, as was his cus- \u25a0 ;
torn, and could not be found, although
his nobles winked at one another.?
while the perturbed French Embassa
dor looked anxiously for the treasure m
ship that never came.
At last the nobles, who. in spite of H
their threatenings. had too much
shrewdness to kill the gold maker. |
hoping his lapse of power was .; only gSj
temporary, forced the question to a (?] i
head and made appeal to the aaÂ£oa-Â»-fej
ished King himself. Here was a man. ;
they said;, who could make gold and 7'
wouldn't. They desired a mandate tOi<
go forth, compelling him to resume the* ;
lucrative occupation he had abandoned. I
The King expressed his amazement
at what he heard and summoned the v >
mountebank before him. The gold
maker abandoned his robe of scarlet fe
and appeared before James dressed so
tferly. He confessed that he knew the "
secret of extracting gold from ordinary
soil but submitted that he was not a I
Scottish citizen, and. therefore could
not properly be coerced by the Scottish
laws so long as* he Infringed none of |j
tlit; statutes. The King held that this I
appeal was well founded and disclaim- f^.
Ed any desire to coerce a citizen of a i \u25a0
friendly state. -At this the charlatan]^
brightened perceptibly, and proportion-^4
ately the gloom on the brows of the no- y
bles deepened.
"But if you can produce gold, as you r ;|
say. why do you refuse to do so?" de-;*;i
manded the King. .
"I respectfully submit to your Ma-J|
jesty," replied the mountebank, "that,;'
I have now perfected an invention eft, j
infinitely greater value than the gold- |
making process; an Invention that will 4
give Scotland power possessed by no I

rather than waste my time in what 'Is;*;
after all, the ldwest pursuit to which ajl
man may demean himself, namely, thej,l
mere gathering of money," and tho^v
speaker cast a glance of triumph at the].*
disgruntled Barons.
"I quite agree with you regarding,
your estimation of acquisitiveness,"!:
said the King cordially, giving no heedp
to the murmurs of his followers. "Inj"
what does this new invention consist?**?:
"It Is simply a pair of wings, yourij
Majesty, made from the finest silk;^
which I import from France. They
may be fitted to any human being and|>; ;
they give that human being the power'
whicÃ birds have long possessed."
"Well." said the King with a laush.;y
"I should be the last to teach a Scot-*V
tlsh warrior to fiy; still the ability, toff
do so would, have been, on several oc-i, ?
casions. advantageous to us. Have you
your wings at hand?"
"Yes. your Majesty."
"Then you yourself shall test them l^
in our presence." %\
"But I should like to spend, your ri
Majesty, seme further time on prep-ji
aration," demurrred the man uneasily.:!
"I thought you said a moment ago:]
that the invention was perfect." â¢'!
"Nothing human is perfect, your'i
Majesty, and if I said so I spoke .withi
the overconfldence of the inventor.: 1^

When the Italian was at last equip- li
ped, looking like a demon in a paint-,
ing that hung in the chapel, the King ~"[
led the way to the edgo of Stirling

"There," he said, indicating a spot;

could not find in all Scotland a better;

The terrified man stood for a moment*

was perhaps misunderstood because of

"I fear you have been too impetuous 1

David Lyndsay the faint suspicion of ai
wink momentarily obscured his eye^-ar
temporary veiling ot the royal efful-I
gence which passed unnoticed, as every |
one else was gazing over the cliff at *
the motionless formÂ«of the fallen man.i
"I am to blame. Bire." replied the ;|
Embassador contritely, "but I think L

heap of bonnet pieces of the King s
own coinage. Beside this heap lay a
scrbll with the requisities for writing.
The money- taker, a gaunt foreigner
clad in long robes like a monk, closed
the door and barred it securely, then
returned to the table. He nodded to
Sir David and glanced with some tlis
truct upon his plaid-covered compan
"Whom have you brought to us, Sir
Lyndsay?" asked the man suspiciously.
"A friend of mine, the master of Bal
lenge'ch; one who can keep his own
counsel and who wishes to turn an
honest penny."
Â£We cdmlt none except those con
nected with the court." demurred the
n.oucy-taker. .
"Well, in a manner, Ballengeich is
connected with the court. He supplies
the castle with the products of nia
farm."
"I am deeply grieved to refuse you,
sir, but I cannot disobey my strict in
structions." ,_\u25a0,,-,
"Oh. very well.. then," said the King
impatiently, "we will stay no further
question. Sir David here is a close
friend of the King, and a friend of my
own. therefore we will return to the
castle and get the King's warrant,
which, I- trust, will open any door in
Striling."
The warder seemed nonplused at ,
this, and looked quickly from one to
the other: finally he said:
"Will you allow me a moment to con
sult with mv master?"
"Very well, so that you do not hold
us long," replied the master of Ballen
geich. , \u25a0 .
"1 shall do my errand quickly, for at
this moment I am keeping the whole
nobility of Scotland waiting."
The man disappeared, taking, how
ever, the gold with him in a bag. In a
short space of time he returned, and
bowing to the two waiting men he
said:
"My master is anxious to please you,
Sir Lyndsay, and will acept the
money of your friend." â¢ Whereupon
the two placed upon the table five gold
pieces each and the amount was cred
ited opposite their names upon the
parchment- w
The experiment was carried on preÂ»
cisely as Sir David had foretold, but
there was one weird effect which the
poet had not mentioned. When the ne
cromancer added to the melting-pot
huge lumps of what appeared to be
common soil from the field the mixture
glared each time with a new color.
Once a vivid violet color flamed up,
which cast such a livid death-like hue
on the faces of the knights there pres
ent that each looked upon the other in
obvious fear. Again the flame was
pure white; again scarlet; again blue-,
again yellow. When at last the incan
tation was complete the bellows-work
was stopped. The coruscating caldron
was lifted from the fire by an iron
hook and chain and set upon the stone
floor to cool, bubbling and sparkling
like a thing of evil; but the radiance
became duller and duller as time went
on, and finally its contents were poured
out into a mold of sand, and there con
gealing, the result was lifted by tongs
and laid upon the scale. The bag of
gold was placed again in the opposite
disk, but the heated metal far out
weighed it. The wizard then unlocked
a desk and threw coin after coin in the
pan that held the bag. until at last the
beam of the scale hung level. The sec
retary now pushed forward a table to
the edge of the platform, and on the
table placed a rush-light which served
but to illuminate the parchment before
him. With great rapidity l.c counted
the gold pieces which were not in the
bag, then whispered to his master.
The room was deathly still as the
man in scarlet stepped forward to
make his announcement.
"I regret," he said, "that our ex
periment has not been as successful as
I had hoped. This doubtless has been
caused by the poverty of the earth
from which I took my material.^ I
shall dig elsewhere against our next .
meeting, and then we may look for
better results. To-night I can return â¢
to you but double the money you gave

At this there went up what seemed
to be a siKluof relief from the audi
ence, which had been holding its
breath with all the eagerness of a gam
bler who had made a stake and await
ed the outcome y of the throw.
The necromancer, taking the parch
ment, called out name after, name,
and as each title was enunciated the
bearer of it came to the edge of the
1 platform and received from the sec
retary double the amount of gold %
pieces set dowi>on the parchment. As
each man secreted his treasury he
passed along out of the hall; and so it
came about that Sir David and Bal
lengeich, being last on the list, re
ceived the remaining coins on the.ta
ble and silently took their departure.
The King spoke no word until they
'had entered the castle and were with
in his private room. Once there, the
first thing he did was to pull from his
pouch the coins he had received and
examine them carefully one By one.
"You will find them genuine," said
Sir David. "I had them Rested by a
goldsmith in Edinburgh and was as
sure^ the pieces are just what they
claim to be."
"Prudent man!" exclaimed the King,
throwing himself down on a seat and
jingling the gold pieces. "Well. Davie,
what do you think of it all? Give me
an opinion as honest as the coin. Has
our visit to-night then taught you
nothing, David?" --.... .
"Nothing but what I knew, before.
What has it taught your Majesty?"
"In the first place our charlatan
does not want the King to know what
he is doing, because when his subor
dinate refused me admittance and I
said to him I would appeal to the.
King he saw at once that this was se
rious and wished to consult his mas
ter. His master was then willing to.
admit any one so long as there was no
appeal to the King. I therefore sur
mise he is most anxious to conceal his
operations from me. What is your
opinion, Davie?"
"It would -seem that your -Majesty
is in the right."
"Then again, if he is & real scientist,
and has discovered an easy method of
producing gold and is; desirous to en-"

ITC the dusk of the evening King
James went down the high street
of Stirling, keeping close to the
wall, as was his custom when about '
to pay a visit to his friend the cob
bler.
As he was about to turn out of the
main street he ran suddenly into the
arms of a man coming from the shop
of a clothier, who made costumes for
the court.
"Ea, Davie!" cried the King, "it's
surely late in the day to -choose the
colors for a new jacket."
"Indeed, your Majesty is in the
right," replied Sir David, "but I was
not selecting cloth; I was merely en
acting the part of an honest man and
liquidating a reckoning of long stand
ing."
"What, a poet with money!" ex
claimed the King. "Who ever heard
of such a thing? . Man Davie, you
'might share the knowledge of your
treasure house with a friend. Kings
are always in want of money. Is your
gold mine rich enough for two?" ;
The King spoke jocularly, placing
no particular meaning upon his words,
and if Sir David had answered in kind
James would doubtless thought no
more about the matter, but the poet
stammered and showed such evident
confusion that his Majesty's quick
suspicions were at once aroused.
"Davie." cried James, "you make a
Very poor conspirator."
"Indeed, your Majesty," replied the
poet earnestly, "no one is less of a
conspirator than L"
"Darts, you are hiding something
from me."
The knight was visibly perturbed,
but at last he answered:
"In this matter I am sworn to se
crecy."
"All secrets reveal themselves at the
King's command." replied James
sternly. "Speak out; speak fully, and
speak quickly."
"Well, there came some time since
to Stirling an Italian chemist, who
took up his abode and set up his sHop
in the abandoned refectory of the old
monastery. He is the author of many
wonderful inventions, but none inter
ests the court so much as the com
pounding of pure gold in a crucible
from the ordiuarv earth in the fields."
"I can well believe that." cried the
King. "I have some stout fighters in
my court, who fear neither man nor
devil In battle, yet who would stand
with mouth agape before a juggler's
tent. But surely, Davie, you, who
have been to the college and have
read much from the learned books,
are not such a fool as to be deluded
by that ancient fallacy, the transmuta
tion of any other metals into gold?"
Sir. Da.vid laughed uneasily.
"I d'd not say I believed it. your
Majesty, still a man must place some
credence in what his eye sees done, as
well as in what he reads from books;
and alter all the proof of the cudgel
is the rap on the head. I have be
held the contest, beginning with an
empty pot and ending with* a bar of
gold."
"Doubtless. I have seen a juggler
swallow hot iron, but I have never be
lieved it went down his throttle, al
though it appeared to have done so.
Did you get any share of the trans
muted gold ? That's the practical test,
my Davie."
"That is exactly the test your
barons applied. I doubt if their no
bilities would take much Interest in
a scientific experiment. Each man en
tering the laboratory pays what he
pleases to the money taker at the
table, but it must not be less than one
gold bonnet-piece. When all have en- .
tered the doors are closed and locked.
The amount of money collected is
weighed against small bars of gold
which the alchemist places in the op
posite ecale until the two are equally
balanced. This bar of gold he then
throws into the crucible."
"Oh, he puts the gold Into the cru
,'cible. does he? Where, then, is the
profit? I thought these necromancers
xnade gold from iron."
"Elgnor Farinl's method Is different,
your Majesty. He asserts that like
attracts alike and that the gold in the
crucible will take to Itself the minute
unseen particles which he believes ex
ist in all soils, the Intense heat burn
ing away the dross and leaving the
refined gold."
"I ccc: and how ends this experi
ment?"
"The residue is cooled and weighed.
Sometimes It is double the amount of
gold put In, sometimes treble; and I
have known him Opon occasion take
from the crucible quadruple the gold
of the bars, but never have I known
a melting: fall below double the
amount collected by the man at the
table. At the final act each noble
has returned to him double or treble
the p-old he relinquished on entering."
â¢â¢Where, then, arises the profit to.
your Italian? I never knew these for
â¢lgners to work for nothing."
"He says he does it for love of Scot
land and hatred of England; an ancient
enemy Were but the Scottish nation
rich, he thinks they could the better
withstand incursions from the south."
"Well, Davie, that seems to me a
most unsubstantial reason. Scotland's
protection has been her poverty in all
except hard knocks. Were she as
wealthy as France it would be the
greater temptation for Englishers to
overrun the country. My grandfather,
James 111, had a black chest full of
e&id and Jewels, yet he was mur
dered, flying from defeat In battle.
When does this golden wizard fire his
caldron, Davie?" â
"To-night, your Majesty. That is
the reason the nobles of your court
were making sly haste to his domi
cile."
"Ah, and Sir David Lyndsay was
hurrying to the same spot so blindly
that he nearly overran his monarch."
"It is even so, your Majesty."
"Then am I hindering you from much
profit, and you must even blame your
self for being so long in the telling.
However, It is never too late to turn
one bonnet-piece into two. 'So, Davie,
lead the way, for I would see this
alchemist turn out gold from a pot as
a housewife boils potatoes."
"I fear, your Majesty, that the doors
will be shut."
"If they are, Davie, the King's name
will open them. Lead the way; lead
the way"
The doors were not shut, but were
just on the point of closing when Sir
David put his shoulder to them and
forced his way in, followed closely by
his companion. The King and his
henchman found themselves In a small
anttroom, furnished only with a bench
and a table; on the latter was a yellow

We all have it in greater or less de
gree, and usually take it out for exer
cise only when we are away from home
and iVi contact with the civic pride of
other people.
, "This can be made the finest city on
earth," says Commissioner Algeltlnger's
civic pride, and it is this faith that
sends him out after and between office
â¢ hours; .to "examine* into the needs and
possibilities of the city.
"Just 'like a man who is making: a
; home for his family," he > says going
I back to his' original Illustration, "the
Officials of a city must look out not
only for the needs of the present, but
for those of the future.
r "The wonderfully rapid growth of San
Francisco arid the promise of \u25a0 even
greater growth jn the future are very
urgently . demanding some pretty big
improvements to be made right now.
"The first requirement of a great city
is convenient highwaysâ easy " outlets
for* the business traffic and easy out
lets for its population to the pleasure
grounds.
VThese two things San Francisco
needs already, and already some of
them are under way.
"All any one has to do to get an idea
of the city's needs is to go south of
Market street and see how congested
the streets are during the busy hours,
or stand on Market street and see the
tangle of trucks and delivery wagons
with- miscellaneous vehicles, or even
just .try to -cross Market street in a
hurry.
"The city's business has grown be
yond its conveniences and so we must
make more conveniences.
, "This is particularly true of the dis
trict south of Market street. The great
increase in business traffic has shown
trie streets to be too narrow. We are
already at work widening Fourth
street, cutting down the sidewalks to^
widen the driveway.
"This same thing must be done on the
other 'streets south of Market that are
business arteries.' There are fifteen miles
of streets In that section of the city that
must be widened in order to meet the r'e
| quirements of business traffic. They can
be made eight feet wider by cutting down
the sidewalks four feet on each side.
Then they must be paved with basalt
blocks on asphaltâ the necessary pav
ing for streets where there is heavy
traffic. The basalt blocks can stand the
wear and tear and the asphalt reduces
the noise, vibration and jar of travel.
"It will cost about $20,000 a mile to do
this, and there are, as I said, about fif
teen miles : of streets waiting right now
to be widened and paved. And this Is
just one item in the ljst of improvements
San Francisco needs.
"The utilities must be considered firstâ
the business prosperity of the city .de
mands that; and along this line the city
need* sex-eral outlets 'for its traffic, to di
vert It from Market street, to avoid ! the
difficult grades and to increase the ac
cessibility of different sections of the
city.
"The northern and . northwestern sec
tions-of the city -are difficult of access
on'account of the hills. On this account
one thing 'that the city needs is the
boulevard along J'the water front . from
the foot Â«f . Market street to Fort Mason.
i Such a ': boulevard will give an easy out
let to; that side of '-'.the city ;_arid take the
heavy trucks and delivery, wagons off
Market : street; and : it will also beautify
.the city/, It Is 'planned to : make this with
a driveway/ sixty feet wide and sidewalk
fifteen feet wide, with trees on both sides.
,: In:! addition 'to being of great ~ : - business
value, it "; will offer a \ sort of pleasure
ground, ; f6r where a ,the \ water . front "is
. open : benchei can , be \u25a0 placed * under . the
-. trees for } people who ; want to see the
beauty, of the bay; IV; ;
'i "To give ; an [ outlet to traffic from; tho
'city" center Tenth 'street Is. to be widened,
as well as Fourth â¢ street, and ', Mission is
to be widened to Jllntn. \u0084 t - .
"For all that lower section of the city
between the water front and Fourth
street and south of Market, with its great
business interests, there is now no con
venient highway. What it needs is a
boulevard offering an outlet into San
Bruno and San Mateo County, where the
city promises to extend in its prosperous
future. Such a boulevard is already
mapped out along natural lines.
"Fourth street; already being widened,
will be its beginning', and 'it will run .
along Fourth street," then along Ken
tucky street, then ,along Railroad ave
nue, all adequately widened, right out to
the shell road in San Bruno.
"This boulevard will afford a splendid
outlet -and will at the same time make
our big shipbuilding interests and dry
docks and iron works convenient to tour-
ists, most of whom are interested in see
ing them when they visit San^ Francisco.
This is an improvement that "will supply
a present need as well as meet a future
requirement, and the requirement of a
not very distant future.
"In considering improvements in this
section it would be well to have Channel
street dredged and banked with a re
taining wall, after the fashion of Euro
pean cities.
"A little farther up town the conges
tion can again be relieved by the wid
ening of Tenth street to Potrero ave
nue, which is in itself a fine wide thor
oughfare.
"Mission street offers another con
venient outlet into San Mateo " County,
and it has already been widened from
College Hill to the county line into a
fine driveway of eighty feet in width.
"Nineteenth avenue also is to be ex
tended, the Supervisors having appro
priated the money for that purpose. It
Is to be extended to connect with the
Colma road, and as it runs directly
into Ocean avenue It offers a way into
and out of San Mateo County that is
free from heavy grades and Is conse
quently especially valuable to autorao
billsts.
"Boulevards and extensions such as
these are needed now in the present de
velopment of the city and as a prepara
tion for its future would be a real
economy, as well as an impetus to de
velopment.
"Every great city needs pleasure
grounds, of course, and one of its first
duties to Its population Is to give easy '
access.. to such .pleasure grounds, to
bring: them near the people.
"For the future San Francisco our
ocean beach offers an unparalleled play
ground and before it is too late the
highways leading to it must be made'
as easy and attractive as possible.
â¢ "One of the'flrst things to do is to
make a boulevard to the ocean, con
necting Corbett road with Ocean ave
nue and' widening and beautifying
both. This will make one of the most
beautiful of city drives. Ocean avenue
should be made 120 feet wide and Cor
bett road increased to eighty feet^Thls
boulevard should be macadamized like
the park roads, and oiled, and should
have sidewalks, with trees and benches.
It can be accomplished at an outlay of
about $40,000, at an outside estimate,
arid will be a highway of priceless ben- -.
efit to this city^ in the future.
'. -'There should, of course, b,e a boule
vard to the ocean on each side of Gold
en Gate Park, and already the making
of these is under wayi H street, for
the convenience of residents on . the
south side of the park and Fulton street
for those on the north side. These are
to be â macadamized and \u25a0 to be bordered
with,, trees if the property owners will
combine to plant them. These streets
are each four and a half miles long and
thus would add nine miles to the city's
beautiful -driveways, at an outlay of
not more than $60,000."

Francisco, along these coming boule
vards and highways, and I am con
structing in my miild a glorified San
Francisco, where it Is possible to go
from point to point with ease and dla
patch â an almost unbelievable San
Francisco.
"How long," I inquire a little anx
iously, wondering if I shall survive for
the accomplishment of the dream, "how
long will it take to do all this?"
"Aboutâ -let me see," , half shutting
'his shrewd, practical business eye*, and
putting his thumbs in his waistcoat
pockets during the mathematical pro
cess, "just about three years. Yea, I
think it will take all of three years."
Somehow the nearness of the consum
mation, the possibility of participating;
in the benefits of such improvements,
gives a vital interest.
Of course it is very lovely to do
things for posterity, but It Is far more
stimulating to do them for yourselfâ
alas that human nature is so selfish.
So I ask. with a very real interest,
how it is to be done.
"Well," explains the practical business
man. "the necessity for and the desira
bility of these improvements being recog
nized by the Board of Works, wo gat
plans and specifications for the work to
be done, recommend them to the" Super
visors and ask for an appropriationâ not,
of course, for an appropriation for the
whole thing, but for the amount of work
that can be done in a year. Then we get
the appropriation for the yeaj>-lt is put
into the budget for the year, you see.
"Then we get the authorization to spend*
the money appropriated.
"The plans and specifications are pre
pared in detail and ' submitted to tha
Board of Supervisors. They approve.
"Of course, I am only telling you wi.it
the process is," comments Commissioner
Aigeltlnger, without & suspicion of hu
mor, unless It be & passing twinkle in tho
very business-like eyes.
\u2666'Then we let a contract to do the work;
see that everything is done according to
the specificationsâ that all the tradings.
the materials and everything are as sped
fled; the city accepts the work, addâ that
iaalL"
"Tho *ftt"y la done ? The> boulowds *ra
Put in this very matter-of-fact -any. ft
.sounds very attractiveâ tha thinf seoma
as good as done!
"How much will it cost-all et ttV I
ask as an afterthought. *V.}
"Well, I guess it can be done Inside of
half a million."
"And who will pay for Itr'
"The city; of courseâ and the property
owners. In the case of the boulevard
along the water front the property own
ers will pay half, and the city and Har
bor Commission will divide the other half
between them. The entire boulevard will
cost not more than $10,000, so that tho
cost to the city will not be very great."
"But will the property owners be enthu
siastic enough, when It comes to going
down into their own pockets, to refrain
from fighting the project?"
"Why, it is easier to get the property
owners to make improvements than it 13
to get tha consent of the city and the
'money from tha city funds. An intelli
gent property owner appreciates the fact
that such Improvements increase the
value of his property, and be is not only
willing-, but he is even anxious, to find the
moneyâ sometimes."
I don't know if Commissioner Aigel
tinger sees the property owner in the
glow shed by his own civic pride and en
thusiastic optimism, but I am quite Â«ure
that it is a civic pride and an optimism
so inspiring of confidence that I am
half tempted on my way down town to
order an auto so as not to be caught un
ready by the coming benefits.
Frivolity aside, however. Commissioner
Aigel tinker's plans are plans that surely
must appeal to the civic pride and inter
est, of every San Franciscan, with or
without an autoâor a bicycle.

I know that "front office." On two
Bides of It 'there, are rows of chairs

Then later I carried her back and forth
to school. Her father was as sturdy
and God fearing a man as ever glad
dened a true woman's heart, and her
mother was the fit mate for the man
hood of him. The little girl was the
only child; and though I say this as
shouldn't, I suspect it was destined to
be their only child, for as the years
rolled by the light of hunger grew in
their eyes as other mothers and other
fathers entered with their children,
three and four, and five â and never
they entered with other than one."
The Voice ceased for a moment, and
it seemed that there was nothing in
all life save the Immensity and the
awfulness of the tragedy being acted
out before my eyes; the tragedy of a
vase, far, far more precious than Chal
dean ceramic, destined so soon to
crash down from Its shrine about two
heart broken votaries, spilling out all
the glorious roses of hope and pride
and ambition to mildew and decay.
The Voice continued. "And yet, even
out there, out in the beautiful park,
where the little birds sing of peace and
love and content, and the flowers and
the trees, attaining to rich, ripe frulta
tlon, teach the beneficence of God to
those who never question Him. and the
sweet sunshine and the fresh breezes
from the ocean all lovingly conspire to
keep the mind sweet and pure and
wholesome and away from evil influ
encesâeven there the serpent entered;
even there the tempter found oujt my
little Dot"
Again the Voice ceased, and, lost in
painful meditation, I . offered np Inter
ruption. Finally it came again, as the
voice comes of one who suddenly
catches himself out of a melancholy
reverie.
"It all happened no later than this
evening. And from the last glimpse I
had of her I knew the Inevitable re
sult, so to see her now does not sur
prise, but only saddens me.
"She had walked, I think, to the Junc
tion for some little purchases and was
returning home. The night, as you
know, was beautiful and moonlight.
As I had switched around at the ter
minal she had stepped across to the
park entrance and stood there for a mo- .
ment, full in the light of the glowing
moon. There was something ethereal
enhalolng her â Just a wisp of a
curl wafted about her clear forehead,"
just a glimpse of the young and inno
cent soul In her eyes, looking In awe,
upon the majesty of the night â she,
symbolized ideal maidenhood in all of
Its timid tenderness; the was herself. a
part of that pure scene.
"I left the terminal and was rounding
the Page-street curve, watching for the
last glimpse I should have of her that
evening-, as I thought, when I saw her
accosted by a man in- an automobile. '
Whether "she knew him or ; hot. I .'do' I
not know; my last glimpse of her was, 1
as she began to. climb in. It haunted me. '
"I have seen too many girls enter I
*T OU may say that I fell asleep; I
/ I will not dispute you. It would be
M obviously too profitless.
y^l It was the three o'clock owl car
- that I took that morning:, the one
I always caught on my late nigrhts
at the office. I remember quite distinctly
that the car was lightly laden. I remem
ber also that a coup.Â© ~ot on at Mason
street. The girl was very young, hardly
sixteen, 1 should say. and at no late date
must have possessed a face of singular
sweetness and repose. The man was the
regular characterless specimen of a
Tenderloin floater.
The whole horrible story was told in her
flushed, hectic cheeks and her abnor
cai.y bright eyes. She staggered as she
fell into her seat and laughed loudlyâ
the loud, chilling laugh of alcohol com
ing through lips that perhaps before that
night had never known, other than the
care-free laugh of light-hearted sixteen.
The roue leaned over to her with what in
other situations might have been the
commending smile of a pleased Instructor
to an apt pupil, but with what was merely
an evil leer: "Well, kido. beats Sunday
Echaol, eh?" "Sure thing." she replied.
"That's what I call life." Her reply
came out with such a r" J *". miserable at
tempt at familiar camaraderie that it was
pitiful. Undoubtedly the man had made
his point; another girl was started on tne
primrose path of dalliance; a young girl
in her early slxteÂ«ns. before judgment,
character or perce ons had formed,
trusted to her ow will through the crim
inal carelessness, the misplaced trust, or
the cruel indifference of her parents.
Then It was. while speculating, half
nauseated, upon the sad tragedy of the
thing, and wondering why no law could
be framed that would hang these- Ten
derloin perverts, that the Voice of the
Owl Car broke In upon my meditations.
At first It cams like a subtle essence, or
an Intangible- odor that one having ex
perienced once vainly tries to place. It
was aot the defined utterance of worda;
it was rather emanations from, the en
compassing space. It was as one might
catch from the midst of a dense throng,
the voice of a friend, and essay futilely
to place It. And yet It was Insistent, pa
tient and certain. Then at last I re
ceived the Voice; my system. In some tel
epathic way. attuned Itself to the thing
in the void that held its message -for me
and It was clearer then than the voice
of the quick. It cams slowly, easily,
without halt or hesitation, in measured
Impulses; and yet, I thought, a trifle sad
ly. It was as the voice might be of one
aged, and bent and ripe in all experi
ence, who. having sounded the depth of
human Joy and woe. Bits far upon his
height and surveys the mad struggle
beneath him. Realizing the futility of
passion, the worthlessness of sham, the
hypocrisy of shew, and understanding too
late that content Is the only goal, he sur
veys mournfully the pathos of the mad,
misdirected struggles going oa far be
neath him for the Ideals of mammon and
the flesh.
"Yes," the Voice said, "You see It too.
Surely it is horrible; more horrible than
you with your youth, ana despite your
newspaper experience, can realize."
I made no answer In words; but my ac
quiescence was conveyed subtly and sure
ly, and the Voice continued:
"I have marked you often and often I
have tried to reach you; but it has re
mained for to-night, when your soul was
restless at this pitiable sight, for me to
penetrate to your consciousness. It is
Indeed a sad, cad story. Before to-night
the soul of that girl was purer than the
soul of a vestal virgin; now she has
been debauched and her soul has fled In
horror from its shrine.
"Her name is Dot Years ago I was on
the day run and many a time have I
smiled to myself flying past the Panhan
dle to see her playing happily there with
her little comrades.
"I always felt honored when, she was

der beat; my motors whirred more Joy

with merrier rhythm. For many years

THE
SENSITIVE
MAN.
THE TALE THAT THE
OWL CAR
TOLD: SAN-FRANGISGOi:SUNDiVy^GAI^
Q^HOMAS JEFFERSON JONES was
I a statesman; that is to -say, he
I had never-held office. When a'
I man has once been elected to any
â¢* thing he is bound" to" become
either a politician or a martyr. It
might be possible for a. man to be right
and President and popular all at the
same time, but in the lower strata, of ;
the political formations the effort is not
likely to meet with either success or.
general approval. ; If this were not the
case, there would be so many honest
men In office that they w'ouldput in all
their time throwing bouquets at them
selves and keeping an eye on each
other so that they -would never get any
thing done. Rascals come Jiigh, but
they have to make a bluff \t earning
their salaries and they provide work
for Â«rrand Juries and keep the deputy
marshals from going to sleep on their
beats.
But to get back to Thomas Jefferson
before he escapes. As we said above,
he wr.B a statesman. What he didn't
know about the science of government
wouldn't have been enough to furnish a
working equipment for a woman's club
and his knowledge- was never al^wed
to grov.- stiff in the knets from lack of
exercise. Every time there was a fair
chance he would bring out his voice
and spray language around over every
thing.in sight. As a result of this prac
tice he succeeded In convlncing.a num
ber of people that the world had been
putting In most of its time hitherto sit
ting around on its heels and waiting, for
him to come along and tell it what wag
what and why. It's a well-known psy
chological fact that" you, can make peo-*
pie believe almost anythlng : if. you: keep
telling them lonff -enough; that's r the
way a great many men acquire a front
seat In the temple of fame. If they were
to wait till they were invited^ in : they
would never .get past, the' bouncer at
the door.
It happened that after" a time, the peo
ple in-Thomas Jefferson's. OongressionaJ
district .became .weary, and ' iIL a.t ease ,
with their (mis) Representative In Con
gress.' It: was. currently- believed ; th"at
he -was! in- the!' employ vof. \u25a0 .the wrony,
trust,, which is ; almost, as great a mis
take as not to' be in the -employ of any.
Constituents! will stand-for a good' deal, '
but they insist on seeing -the Ideal., So li
fell out that when Thomas Jefferson
blew down among them and announced
that he had. been foreordained .by fate : :
and his professor of political <!-onomj'"
to. lay. violent 'hands- on ! the- htlm -and.

The outlook was as bright. and fair for

him and the head of the list, when one
sad day ' he was asked to lend the' weight
of his/.influence to an insignificant little
biir introduced by a man who confessed
to hailing from Chicago." It was a very
unassuming measure and purported 1 to be
a "Bill tor allow, the construction of a

do with it? You'd go away to some
town and be laughed at. I guess. You'd
go In and order a meal and kill your
self. If you escaped dyin' right then
all of the diseases that have a con
tempt for the average poor man would
crowd around and associate with you.
\u25a0It would seem that everybody was try-
In' to rob you, and when you had dis
covered that all the brightness that
you supposed in the world wasn't
nothln' but the ordinary yaller that
covers a dog you'd hobble home to die
in disgust where you might have died

\u25a0 ''Wish I was dead this minute," Briz

"Well, I won't say It wouldn't be bet
ter for you for I am inclined to think it
would. Does your wife know about It?"
"No, and j I don't know, how to tell her."
"I reckon not. It's hard for a man
to acknowledge even to his wife that he's

"What, would you have me deceive

"Oh, you old hyppercrit. Briz. Let me
see. Three thousand dollarsâ just about
all your farm's worth. Nobody but you
and your wifeâ had plenty to live on:
but you wanted to be rich. Why, because
you aretlred of work? Idleness Is a hun
dred per cent more tiresome than work. ,
I'd just like to get on the inside of your j
mind for a mlnit and look around. About
two months ago I met old Dabney Branch.
We " rode along horseback together. Ha
was complainin" because the rate of inter
est-was lower than it had been. I told
him It wasn't a bad sign for the neigh
borhood; that it wouldn't argue thÂ« cryin* .
need of money. I asked him about how
much money he could lend and he said
he could spare twenty-five thousand,
on good' security. I asked him how old
he was - and \u25a0 he answered that he was
eighty-two. That old and with
$25,000 he didn't need.- I said to him, I\
says, 'Mr. Branch, I'll bet you ten dollars
you won't live two months.* 'What the
deuce do you mean?" he cried out. 'Oh. I
don't want -to offend youâ just want the
ten dollars." Take the bet?' 'Jucklln,* he
said, *I am ashamed of you thus making
game of Providence." *Oh,' said I, *you are"
the one that is makin* game of Providence.
Providence has tried to teach you a les
son and you have deafened your ears.
But Mr. Branch, there's one thing I'd like
to know. How can you be - Interested
In gettln' niore money when you have
more. than you need? Good bye; I don't
expect ever to see you again.' And ai
you know, Briz. he died last week. Good
thing. Oh. I tell you old nature is a
great democrat." "
1 "1. wish I had another chance to be
honest." said Briz. "If I could only keep
my home I'd thank the Lord the rest of
my days/*.
"Yes, I v guess so. What have. they done
toward catchin* the thief?"*
"Well, two deputy sheriffs have started
out from, ; purdy andâ here conies one of
them nflw."
An officer, of the law dismounted at the
fence. Briz hastened to meet him. "We
caught the fellow and he had your money
on â¢ him,"; said" the officer. Briz took hold
of -a 1 tree to' keep from falling. "Lta,"
he said, "give >me your hand.'.'
\u0084 ''Well,", the old man drawled,. "don't let
us be In too big a hurry about it. J want
to see you make your first real stagger
toward servin" the Lord."
IT was noticed that Brizintine was
driving about the neighborhood with a
stranger. The County Clerk said that
as he had examined many of the deads
and titles in th* office it must be the
newcomer's intention to buy land. Anoth
er noticeabje phase of the stranger's
stay was the fact that Briz shaved and
put on a clean shirt every morning.
Soon it was made known that the visitor.
Colonel Bloodgcod Hickerson, was going
to give live hundred dollars toward the
building of a new church. Then every
body was inclined to bow down before
Briz. The postmaster said to him: "You
have always been one of our most pro
gressive citizens."
"I know all that," Briz answered, "but
1 haven't always been appreciated. After
this I guess 1 will be. I am going to
build me a new house and live like .a
white man."
"Ah. I congratulate you," said the post
master. "But tell me how you managed
to get that rich man interested in this
neighborhood."
"Why, he had heard of -meâ wrote to
me and I made an appointment to meet
him here and he came. Oh, you fellers
have always thought that nobody outside
the county ever heard of me, and I
have had to bear with it, but times have
changed."
Three days later Colonel Bloodgood
Hickerson took his leave, having set
tled upon the exact spot for the new
church. Two more days passed and then,
one afternoon, Briz called on old Llmuel.
Jucklin was dozing beneath a tree in ths
yard. He got up from, his bench and In
vited Briz to sit down.
"1 cuchtn't to sit but to lie down and
never git up," said Briz.
"Why, what's the trouble?"
"Lim, I'm ruined."
"You don't tell me!"
"Ruined, Lim.'
"But how?"
"I mortgaged everything I had for
JoOOO and gave the money to â to that
infernal scoundrel, Hickerson." He
sat down with a srroan.
"Why did you do it?" Lim inquired.
"Because he showed me how I could
be the richest man not only in the
county, but In the State. I am ashamed
to tell you how it happened. I can't
understand how it was that I could
have been such a fool. He told me he
had at one time a brother In the money
printing department in Washington.
One ni^ht robbers broke. in and stole
the plates they print the big money on.
That is, .such was the report. But the
fact is th.it Hickerson's brother got
the rolatcs. He did it because the Gov
ernment owed his father for depreda-
I iions committed by soldiers durin\tho
\u25a0war, and he was determined that the
debt should be paid. I don't know all
tiie persuasion this feller Hickerson
used on me. He said that my home and
all my prospects had been injured by
thÂ« war and that it was no more than
right that I should be rewarded. He
needed 52000 to buy a pressâ had
money enough of his own, but it 'was
Invested. IâlI â I don't know how it was,
but -he got my money."
"Briz. I know how it was. He got
your money because you want honest.
You are }u*t as much a tiilef as lie is."
"You shan't talk to me that way!"
"Hit down," said Lim. "If the worst
comes to the worst I can thrash you.
You know that well enough, so you
ought to Ilnd yourself in a position to
discuss the truth quietly. He touched
you up with a dÂ«sire to get rich. You
didn't tjke into account that you were
Ifitlfa* old and can't in nature live but
a few years longer. In your resent
ment against the fact that you had to
work yju s>hut your eyes to one of the
worst forms of dishonesty, the name
bein* counterfeit!!)'. If there's a man
that can't afford. to be dishonest it is
the old man. It's bad enough with
the youngster, but much worse in the
aged. Of course I am eorry you lost
your money, but somehow I can't wet
mv eyes with sympathy."
"But the man that got it is a thief!"
Briz declared.
"Yea, undoubtedly, and a better thief

a great personal Interest in It all the
same because It was actually baush; by
one of my friends. And thereby hangs
a tale of custom-house tyranny, combined
with unwise interference of husbands â¢In
general and one husband In particular.
Mrs. L. (she was not a Calif orn lap by
the way) saw the dress- when she was
shopping on general principles, and her
husband was with her. To see It was
to admire It, and then to covet the pos
session of Itâ but husband, not being af
flicted with a mania for lace, and really
unable to appreciate the beauty of tha
dress, rebelled at such extravagance* and
drew the purse strings tightly, closed. His
refusal to purchase this beautiful but
costly bit of feminine adornment ' was
weakened by a recital of tha. fearful
duties which would be exacted under our
high tariff laws. â¢
It was in vain that Mrs. L. protested
that, she would be quite able to bring It
â¢into our boundaries without duty. Sha
was no exception to tha proverbial re
proach that all women are natural smug
glers. Mr. IÂ», however, would not Sanc
tion a flagrant breach of our lairs Ilka
that, and she .went back to tha hotel de
jected and crestfallen. - â¢ r
But the morning light Inspired her with
new courage, and she wended ' her way.
with firm resolve, and actually bought
the dress, and kept the secret from her
husband.
And now comes his . unwisdom and
what it cost. On their arrival at New
York Mr. L. prompted by" a desire to
play a practical Joke on his wif a. con
fided to the officer of the customs that
she had a - valuable dress of lace In her
trunk which she had bought In Brus
sels, and which she was now In tha act
of smuggling into this country.-
Fancy the dismay of his wife and tha
inane horror of the husband as tha dresa
(which he bad supposed was still ex
hibited at Brussels to 'entrap rich Amer
> lean women) was unearthed from tha
trunks, and the duties on which fairly
shocked his sensibilities and his pocket
book.
I will not undertake to pomt tha moral
of this "over, true atory." but there are
two- or three morals to it. which are ob
vious enough without telling. I may only
mention one. which may ba called a sub
moral or incidentalâ and that ts that, as
lace is not an American Industry; ' It is
painful to have; to pay tremendous du
ties upon It. particularly when the lace
is really such a beautiful work of art as
the dress I have been telling: about.

Irish lace waists are still- very much

\u25a0 'In. a little mountain department in
-Fjance, called Auvergne, there . are
'thousands of women making lace. For
.very,- very fine work they sometimes
use goat's or rabbit's hair. '.These wo
\u25a0 men earn .but little, but they are con

The. finest of the French laces Is the
"point, d'Alencon." Empress Eugenie's
ivory /eatin : wedding gown had on It ,
four flounces of d'Alencon lace. On an
' other rgown she had one single flounce
â¢that \u25a0\u25a0 had taken thirty-six- women a
year and a half to make. This flounce
'was; of- the same lace, but of the very
finest quality.. .â¢. â¢
"/â¢Another '-'fine. French lace Is the
."point " d'Argentan," which is a very
flneVneedle'polnt lace, with a net

"Point" .'lace Is often Bpokfen of, but
generally without conveying any clear
â¢ idea of. the meaning. In fact, point lace
really !meant. in old times, a lace of
fine. quality made by needle and thread.
Nowadays, however, the name Is used â¢
to designate any lace of superior qual
ity and design, whether made by needle
or' by bobbin. â¢
/To my thinking, the most beautiful
of all the modern laces is the Venetian
"Rose Point," of which" an ; Illustration '
is given. The real old ' "Rose Poinf,"
however, greatly excels'th'e modern lace '
In beauty. '. '
One flounce of the -.real old "Rose ,
Point" was sold last year in London for -
$1750! and still another piece brought
$75 a yard.
Perhaps this may seem a fabulous,
price for any kind of lace, but it must
be remembered that this old point lace

It. is quite easy to understand why
the old laco is more beautiful than the
modern. Much less of it was used than
now, and more time and greater care*
could* bÂ«Â» given -to, Its -manufacture.
Then, too, it was used only by the no

When I was in Brussels last year I saw

admired tremendously. When I was told

gERWYND'S defalcation was only
$1500. but had he looted the sub
treasury of os many millions
lioontown could not have been
more shocked.
It was not bo much the loss of tho
money to the Eoontown First Na
tional. That was but an incident. It
was the fact that Chet Berwynd
V should have been guilty at all. ;For
generations the Bcrv.-ynds had been
among the leaders of Booutown so
ciety, and it was regarded as a matter
of course that Chct should have been
made cashier and paying teller when
the bank was started.
Some of those who had known
Chester Eerwynd's father refused at
first to believe the charge, but in the
end circumstantial evidence proved too
strong to be ignored and, though Hank
Simmons, the town constable, had a
suspicious moisture in his eyes, he led
Chet ox-<?r to the little village "lock
up" and left him in a. cell, promising
that a rocking chair and other un
rirlson-like conveniences should be sent
over from his own home as soon 'as
possible. Hank had never forgotten
how old Dr. Berwynd had worked for
twelve hours over his little daughter
when she had had the. membranous
croup, though he had just returned
froai a lons ride Into the country.
One did not have to go back to
Chefs father for acts of kindness. As
boy and man Chet had always been
i ready to give his aid to others with
no thought of. return, and his Incar
ceration was a chock to the commu
nity.
Even after the venerable John Hol-
lis had explained that there was a
package of five $100 bills and two $500
certificates which no one could account
for save Chet, who had denied all
knowledge of the money, there -were
those who refused to believe that; Dr.
Berwynd's sou could be guilty.
Foremost among these was Ger
trude Hollis, who set aside even, her
father's opinion to declare herself
openly a partisan of Chct, and It was
one of the things that shook her fath
er's faith in his own "judgment. . Judge
Hollis was a believer in woman's in
tuition.
It was this which induced him- to
hurry the trial lii the hope that some
evidence would turn, up whereby the'
accused cashier might clear himself,
and there was none more pleased
v.'hen. two days before the trial, it. was
discovered that rats had stolen . the
package and had made a nest of the
crisp paper. .
Gertrude discovered the nest 'in a
cranny under the cashier's desk. She
communicated her "find" to her father,
who "was also president of the bank.
It made an insignificant little mass,
this expensive nest, but while the mas
ticated particles ivere too-small to be
redeemed by the Treasury Department,
it was plain to be seen. that- the nest
was composed of ' bills.;- Tbe nest was
duly brought forward at the trial and
was sufficient to. acquit. â¢â¢ V
Chester was the only one dissatisfied
with the acquittal, and that evening 'he
called at the Hollis home. Gertrude met
him with an apology for her father,. for*
whom the excitement of the trial had
been too much. .;
"It was you I . came to | see," . returned
Chester.. "I want to ask you "\u25a0 a question."
The red flashed into Gertrude's 'face.
There had been no open courtship, but It
had seemed to her that there -wu but â¢
one question Chester would want to ask.
Her heart beat high,- but; the next mo
ment her hopes were dashed.

That timeâ tho time of Marie de Medici
âhaving taken up the craze for lace with
great vigor, the French lacemakers grew
mare and more expert and skillful, and
their point lace became a serious rival to
the lace of Italy and Flanders, 'under the
name of "Point de France." So jealous
were the French of the Imported rivals
that an edict was Issued ordering the
hangman to publicly burn Venetian (tho
Point de Veuise) and Flandera lace of the
value of 100,000 crowns!
Ono wonders what emotions such a ttr
rible cremation must have excited in the
breasts of lovely women a* they saw.
these beautiful creations perish before
their eyes!
Paris was even then the headquarters,
and official residence of Dame Fashion,
but there were no journals or magazines
or fashion plates then to send broadcast -
over the civilized world.". Little dolls elab-'
oiately and handsomely costumed were
therefore dispatched to the different large
cities to serve for fashion plates. By thi3
means French lace ( became widely known
in almost all countries. .. ;
So absorbing was the cult of lace! that
it was not confined to the ladles of
France. The men, .- .court . gallants,
trimmed their night dresses and night
caps with the finest and most costly lace.
The Due de Ponthlevre expended $104 for
lace collars and cuffs on his : nightdress
and $50 for his nightcaps. What agorge
ous spectacle, he must "have been- by
night! And in what brilliant raiment he
roust have been clothed by day! ':
The flrst straight-edged lace that was'?
in use was Valenciennes lace, which was ,
tnade* In Flanders, and the best. Valen-,
<jiennes Jace. to-day Is made in a little
town, called Ypres, .in West Flanders.
Making Valenciennes lace is a very dlffl-*
cult piece of work. It is made on a pil
low with bobbins, and for an edge of
only two inches in width 200 or 300
bobbins are used." On some of the wid
er pieces there are often a thousand
bobbins* on one pillow. It frequently
takes a week to make one-third of an
inch of the wide lace.
No wonder the price Is high.
Valenciennes lace, as it is now sold, is
neither so fine nor so ornate as It was
formerly. ]
I went to see the lacemakers at work
in Brussels, and came away wondering
whether they would first become blind
before . becoming raving maniacs, or
whether their brains would give way be
fore their eyesight.
They were working in a dimly lighted
room; and. though doing the finest and
most intricate work possible, their fingers
wire moving with the rapidity of light
ning.
Bobbin lacemaklng Is, however, more
intricate to watch, as it seems co Intri
cate and wonderful.

The word itself originally meer.t a cord
or plaited string used for tying or lacing
garment* together, but that must have
been a very, very long time ago. The
lace of to-day, however, in something
like lta present refined form, probably
dates back come four hundred or five
hundred years, and tha origin of it is
claimed both by Flanders and Italy.
Holland also presents a claim for having
originated what may be called the mod
ern lace, but It is in Italian books that
the earliest description of lace is to be
found.
In the progress of It 3 manufacture
the patterns gradually became very elab
orate, and lace made ia the seventeenth
century had designs of flowers, birds
end figures worked on net or meshed
grounds.
Laces of very great value can be
found in the possession of the Roman
Catholic Church, and in some of the
cathedrals of Europe are many priestly
robes trimmed \u25a0with old and costly lace,.
or with gold or silver lace.
In the cathedral on the island of Bu

The Italians have endeavored to re
store this almost lost art, and have had
copies mudo of this old lace, which
still remains in wonderfully good con

At one time the Jews used a great deal
of lace in their synagogues, but some sin
gular law forbade the use of mixed ma
terial on their robes or scarfs. On this
account silk lace was made and the Jews
used It to trim their scarfs with, thus
keeping -Britain tho letter cf their law.
Every one will remember the familiar
.picture of Queen Elizabeth, with an enor-
F boui ruff or collar about her neck. To
the inexperienced eye. at least, it seemed
like a gigantlo collar, but in reality it
was composed of. many yards of lace, and
of very expensive lace, too.
Marie de Medici, Queen of France, wore

How fearfully expensive it must have

THE STORY OF LACEand methods here given will be dry. and
will not show- much dust 'accumulation
from the Inside for some time. Its at
mosphere will be pure and delightful,
there will be no old dust flying about to
distress sensitive lungs and offend a
-neat housewife. Whoever has been in
the midst of or witnessed helter-skelter
workers, who raised a choking dust
wherever they went with dry broÂ«â is
and overloaded dustpans, will realize
the advantage of a method which. tends
to control dust while really removing it.
" And whoever has been compelled to go
about in the midst of flying dust and
general confusion . with skirts held up,
head covered and elbows held close to
avrifil soilâ ln a house supposedly . sing
cleanedâ will appreciate genuine clean
ing. : which dominates while removing
whatever is objectionable and maintains
order at every step of the business.
Until a house is entirely settled, every
entrance should have a mat outside and
a piece of carpet or strong paper Inside
each door. Strong' paper should be. laid
overall clean or polished floors wherever
people are likely to tread. -'All of these
should be carefully lifted every, evening
and the day's dust collected , thereupon
shaken outside. Thoughtless. | careless
people should be reminded by legibly
written notices^ posted in- full sight.
', that 'the doormats are there for their
\u25a0;use and : the protection, of .the. house..
Posted notices are quiet," impersonal re
minders that - offend no one and some
times spare the voice and the _ feellng3

reckless : person can ' undo the cleaning
of half a day.;.
Had I. the versifier's gift. I would sing
the;: song: of : the burnt-match plague.
Burnt matches, .thrown about or left on
window-sills, mantels.- or anywhere but
In 5 suitable 3 receptacles,", are untidy and
chow unpardonable negligence on the
part*of those \u25a0 who : leave them. "Nico
housewives permit' nothing of the^kind
"in-their domains.;. One of the first of the
furnishings; in- every^part of! a -house
should be match-safes and receivers for
burnt, matches. These not only:promoto
tidlnes3,,but,"lf used by everybody, they
prevent an alarm of fire or a conflagra
tion. Probably the majority of fires are
caused by people who throw matches
down heedless of the disorder caused
by their lying about and the risk, al
ways possible, of their not being ex
tinguished. Whether the spark be dead
or alive, there is no excuse for, making
a tidy place untidy, or an untidy place
more untidy, by negligently dropping a
matcMi without even looking to seu If '
there be a p^ce provided for It. Burnt '
matches are not ornamental. They do
not give an air of refinement to a bouse
when they adorn the front steps or Â»tona
\u25a0window sills, albeit in thoaÂ« places thay
may be harmless.
Door-cleaning should be left until the
last, because, during the general set
tling there Is so much going In and out
by people who are apt to leave generous
finger-prints on whatever door they
open or close. The most conspicuous
part ot the door is about the knob, and
cleaning that part often is apt to deface
the paint or polish. It Is a good plan to
protect the most exposed portion by fit
ting a piece of strong paper around th*
knob and fastening It temporarily with
a little paste that will wash off easily
and not injure the woodwork. â¢ â¢
All floor- polldhlnsr or .Boor-staining
should be left until the very last set
tling Is done and the house has ceased
to be a highway of .affairs for all sorts
and conditions of men and women,
either working or delivering goods.
Unless the house .-Is entirely new. be
fore having any beds brought in. maX*
a thorough examination of the > wood
work, the plaster and the paper to dis
cover if vermin of any sort have lodged
there."
This is a case where an ounce of pre
vention will be found eoual to a ton of
cure. Destroy every sign and vestige of ,
any objectionable . Insects before It Ist
possible for them to get into beds or any
â¢ furniture. - Nothing is a more efficacious
vermin-destroyer than fumigation dona
with a sulphur candle. This is very easy
In, an empty house, but It can be dons \u25a0

AROUND THE HOUSEWIVES' COUNCIL TABLE WITH MARION HARLAND
WRITERS upon culinary
topics and practical
housewives make
much of the neces
sity of preserving an even tempera
ture for rising dough in winter time.
The eld-fashioned cook \u25a0wrapped her
bread tray in flannel and newspa
pers and scolded the trespasser who
left the kitchen door open after the
dough was pu| to bed in a warm cor
ner. The trained cook of to-day
sets her doush in a patent pan with
a perforated top, out of possible
draughts, and consults "her thermom
eter regularly and solicitously.
The average housewife assumes,
if ehe does not assert, that summer
breads can take care of themselves.
In reality, overfcrmentaj^on is as
grave an evil as the arrested proc
ess. Summer boarders ijSSiot need
to be reminded how mali^ times a
week sour bread receives the slight
est of apologies from the farmstead
mistress. If she thinks it worth her
while to attempt correction of the
damage done to her dough over
night ; she kneads in soda with a
heavy hand that leaves acrid, yellow
streaks in the Â» baked loaf without
neutralizing the acidity of the mass.
Yet good bread is never more a
necessity of comfortable living than
in warm weather. Sour viscidity in
sults gastric juices and taxes to the
utmost delicate muscles made lax by
heat. Hot yeast bread belongs of
right to the winter bill of fare. It
does not begin to "ripen" until it is
cold, nor does it sit easily upon a
majority of stomachs until it has
been twelve hours out of the oven.
It is so well understood by people
of common intelligence that griddle
cakes come and depart with frost,
that I need not enlarge upon the
reason of their banishment from the
tables of people who have any
knowledge of gastronomic ethics.
Since many eaters, especially the
men and brothers for whose delecta
tion women cater and cook, will
have hot breakfast breads, I offer
to-day some tried and proved re
cipes for a few of these. Here the
work of fermentation is completed
in the baking. They all belong to'
the biscuit family, and, if rightly
made, are delicate and digestible.

THE first line of writing on the
envelope should be the name of
the person to whom the letter Is
. addressed, always with his or
her proper title, a3 Mrs.. Miss or Mr.
I^'ever write simply "Mary Smith" or
"John Brown," Lut always "Miss Mary
Eniith." "Mr. John Brown." If the let
ter is written to a child, it should be
cddrcsEcd "Miss Mary Smith," no met
ier what the age of the recipient; while
\u25a0'Master John Brown" is the proper
tuptjrtcription fora little ooy. Beneath
Ui** name .of the recipient on tho enve
lop, and a little to the right, comes the
number of the house and name of the
etrect written in one line: in the next
line comes the name of town or city,
md then the Elate. If the place is a
tniall one. It is best to write also tho
name of Use county, either in a line by
itself before the State or else in the ex
treme lower left-hand corner. â¢ <-,:
If it is necessary to put clo (in care
of), that should be written, together with
the' name of the person to whose care
Ahe letter goss, cither in a line below the
name uf the person to whom the lctttr is
addressed or else in the lower left-hand
corner.
\u25a0The ink used in writing notes and let
ters should always be black. Our moth
ers used to use a pretty shn.de of violet
,ml;, but this is no longer fashionable.
Composing the Note.
Having acquired the correct stationery,
tht right iort of ink and whatever kind
cf put v.Â« prefer, let ms new proceed to
the business fn ha.^d. In the first place,
btfore writing a word, it is well to sit
iltwn for a lew moments et your dc*k
and ijuict-'y think out what you want to
Â«ay. and then when you begin to write
you v. ill i.v.C that your ideas flow much
more easily, it usÂ«d to-be considered
r.ctcf&ary to leave a narrow margin on
the left side of the note paper; but, al
though tills is. a very good plan, and
gives the correspondence a neat appcar
ar.te, it is no lonper imperative, and
many of the best-educated people write
4.11 over the paper. But there is. one
practice that never must be indulged in.
nr.d that is to cross your writing; time
is thort and modern eyesight is too pre
< iou* to read communications crossed
like a checkerboard.
The Salutation.
The address to' the person for whom
the note is intended, pr "satutatJon," as
it is called, should begin half an inch
below the address of the tender at the
extreme left of tho.poge. Society has
decreed that the expression "My dear"
is ji little more formal than simply
â¢Dear." Thus. If, nn acquaintance is
written ' to. "My <Jear Mrp. . Brown"
would be tbe proper form, while i: tbÂ«
- A man, on the othÂ«r hand, should be
addressed by his. title if he has onft, as
"Major General Green," "Dr. Brown."
etc, or, failing a "handle to his name,"
as "Mr. George Kobinson" or "Gporge
Robinson. Esq." In England this latter
form }s always used except in address
ing tradespeople, but in Arncrjca "Mr."
is more often used,' and is regarded by
many as the most sensible title.
Letters of Introduction.
One of the most puzzling things to
many people is to write letters of intro
duction. This is ; a task which- fulls
more often to a man .than to a woman :
but thcic .come times in the life of al
most every woman when she would like
to give such letters to intimate friends
to present to tier-acquaintances in.dis
tant cities. She should then- write a
short note something like this:'.
Sunset, Colorado.
My Dear Mrs. -Blank:
This will Introduce to you Miss Mabel
Smith, an intimate friend of mine, who
is about to visit' fx T ew York for the first
lime, and Is consequently a stranger in
the city. Any attention which you. may
extend to her will be gratefully appre
ciated by
Yours very cordially,

such a letter of \u25a0\u25a0introduction^frcfm \u25a0 a
friend,"you must call without delay upon
the person IntrpUuccdto you by letter.
â¢There is another kind of letter which,
unrdrtun'atcly. falls to thelot of most of
us' to .write,'' and that is a letter.of.con

Intimacy is greater, "Dear Mrs. Brown"
would be the way to address her. If
it becomes necessary to write to'an'ab
solute stranger, the full name should be
first written on one line and directly un
der it, a little to the right. "Dear Mad
ame," or "Dear Sir." as the case may
be. Thus,
"Mrs. John M. Brown,
Dear Madam,"
would be the proper salutation.
Letters to tradespeople are generally
â¢ written in the third person, something
like this: "Mrs. John 21. Brown, 16
Prospect Terrace. Closwillc, Xew Jersey,
would like Smith. Jones &. Co. to send
her impediately six bottles of their best
salad- oil by express. Inclosed find
cheek for the amount."
It goes without saying that the spell
ing of all notes and' letters should be
absolutely correct. If you are -a little
dubious on this scoreâ and some of our
brightest people can never seem to learn
to spell correctlyâ buy a small, lncx
pensivtt dictionary and keep it in your
desk to consult whenever you are in
doutt.
Whenever you start a nev/ subject, be
gin a new paragraph. *De careful of
your punctuation. I'ut period? at. the
end of your sentencesâ of course, .begin
ning each new sentence with v capitalâ
and, it" the sentences are long or at. all
involved, set off some of the dependent,
clauses with comma..".
The Signature.
A woman should sign her letters and
notes "Cordially yours" or "Yours sin
cerely" when writing to friends and a,c
cjuaintances; to relatives or very . lrili
matp friends she usually -signs hereelf
"Yours affectionately" or "Yours with
love." or something of that sort. . A man
is generally "Sincerely yours" or "Faith
fully yours." No one should eVcrÂ»slgn
her name with its title, Mrs. or. Miss,
unless it is put Jn brackets before !tbe
name: and even thia is allowable only
in writing to an absolute stranger, who
otherwise might be puzzled how to ad
dress the reply. 'â¢"\u25a0\u25a0
Postage should never be inclosed Tor
reply except m notes or letters that are
strictly business - communications, >and
then it must always beput in if a. reply
is requested. But In. all social ' corre
spondence it is considered rather an in
suit to inclose return postage, as the
â¢expense is so slight that our friends are
apt to resent having It sent to then).
The Proper Address. "* " ".
It Js considered very bad form to ad
dress a u-tfe by her husband's title; thus.
..letters to the wife .of v. general should
never, b* uddrttscd "Mrs. General
Orccne."~. but simply. VMn*.- Greene", or
â¢\u25a0MrÂ«:-Jamcs H. Greene." -The titles.

Train joursslf to be a skilled houae-
keeper, I mean working housÂ«keepÂ«r.
It will only secure for you the qulck'er
the position as directing housekeeper.
Should you have a chance to take a
course. of systematic training in domes
tic work, by all means take it, then de
mand good wages and you will receive
them. Buy books on Domestic Service
(a good one is by Lucy M. Salmon, of
Vaasar College) and read and profit by
them. >Until the social stigma attached
to domestic service is removed there
will always be employment for a good
servant. Columns and columns of "ads"
calling for help in housework, from the
little girl to wasn dishes to the house,
keeper, appear in every daily paper.
Because of the impossibility of secur
ing, competent help hundreds of fami
lies are forced to board. I am in a ho
tel because I could find no one to takÂ«
charge of my home; the last servant
leaving because she did not like "to ba
alone in '.he house all day doing noth
ing." I could not find a servant who
could content herself In a place with
so little to do. To me this was ths
"funniest complaint of all.
In thi3 hJotel I notice that everything
is done by specialists, non-re3ldents
who arrive at a certain hour and leave,
regularly at another. The chambermaids
make the beds, pick up things, run tha
sweeper over the floor and ofcst. The
scrubbing is all done by another set of
workers who do nothing elsÂ«. The win
dows are cleaned by professionals.
The cooking is attended to by a 'com
petent chef, and then there is the gen
eral housekeeper, whom, by the way, I
have never seen, though I have been
here two years. I mention this merely
to show you how like clockwork every
thing is done in this co-operative way.
livery worker in the hotel is a "sell
respecting skilled laborer, each individ
ual taking up the work she can do best.
The social atigma is thus largely re
moved.
But. after all, it is not home life. for
us. We are forced to live in this way
simply because of incompetent help.
Kvery lady I have asked says the same
thing here. Each would prefer keeping
house if ahe could find the servants to
keep the house going. %
Strict Apprenticeship Needsd.
. The profession of home making and
the trade of home work require strict
apprenticeship. - Hence. If you cannot
attend a school of domestic scienceâ and
I am sorry to say there are few of them
in existence â learn all there is to ba
known about the particular work you
arc called upon to do. and as you changa
your duties add to your knowledge of
vach branch of housework. When you
once know how to do a thing, and know
that you know it. you are well up on
the ladder of success. Th* only great
school of domestic science In the United
States is the Oread Institute, at Wor
cester. Mass. â¢ One year's course is sup
posed to give you a sufficient knowledge
of most household duties. One frea
scholarship is given each year to each

KM losing her popularity in Eng
lanflT" Is a Question which one hears
frequently asked in society circles here.
Many declare that she is not so much
admired as she used to be. She has
grown more reserved, more dignifiedâ
In short, more English. She has made
the mistake of trying to imitate the
English girl. In most cases, perhaps, it
has been unconscious imitation, but the
result has been the same. It is her un
conventionality and pronounced indi
viduality â her unlikeness to the Eng
lish girls in a word â that have made
her such a huge success heretofore.
In the degree that she gets to resemble
them she loses the characteristics that,
combined with her grace and beauty,
constitute her chief charms in English
eyes. The American girl often makes
the mistake of spending too many
consecutive seasons among English so
ciety. She should return to her native,
land every year or two to get the ef
fect of English associations rubbed off
and become thoroughly Americanized
over again, even to her accent.
The popularity of the American hos
tess, on the other hand, is increasing
rather than diminishing. She is cer
tainly doing most of the entertaining
just now. But her popularity rests "on
*<wr><-wiijt di Cerent foundations. She is
in Â«. position to make her dollars count.
As long as she can give more lavish
entertainments than her English, com
petitors her position In the front rank
Is assured, *
Like the Duchess of Manchester, young
Mrs. Bradley Martin promises to become
an accomplished dancer In the Scotch
style. Donald McKay, a professional
Scotch dancer and piper, has been giving
her lessons and he has found her a most
apt pupil. She learned the Highland
fling in six lessons, but Scottish jigs and
reels she found more difficult. In six
months, however, she made "it evident
that she Intended to thoroughly master
Scotland's "poetry of motion." She gave
one hour each day, except Sunday, to her
studies, and now she needs a teacher no
longer. At society functions in Scotland,
especially in the Highlands, Scotch dances
â¢to the tunes of the Scotch pipes always
constitute a part of the entertainment,
, &nd American women making their homes
[â¢In Europe frequently find' themselves in
*m. ratner awkward position when they are
[ forced ; to sit down and merely look on.
:ThÂ© Duchess of Roxburghe was like Mrs.
! Sradley Martin obliged to take lessons.
LONDON, Aug. 13.â One of "Washing
ton's famous- legal lights, a confirmed
bachelor and a member of what has been
called the old "residential aristocracy" of
that city, has decided to leave the land of
his birth and settle permanently in Eng
land. â¢
In discussing the matter with a corre
spondent he said that be Intended to take
this step" because he was tired of T^ash
ington society and wished , to get away
from a locality where, as ne expressed it,
"even my bootblack thinks he is as good
as I any"
He longs to retire from his profession,
in the practice of which he has accumu
lated a considerable fortune, and ; become
one of England's -landed proprietors. In
fact, he has picked out his place, a prop
erty that exactly suits him. and will-soon
return to the United States to dispose of
his "Washinugton residence, close; up , his
business affairs and then conclude the
purchase of the English estate. It-is'sit
uated in Devonshire, the most beautiful
county . in â¢ England, and comprises 13,000
acres, Including a parish in its boun
daries. The disposal of a church living
also goes with the property. The v pur
chase price is about $100,000. /

'/ From the necessities. of his profession
It is*hard.for an actor to have a real
"home" in the best sense of the word.
Yet William Gillette claims three. One
â the. -one ; in] which he spends most of
his time when he is not appearing be
fore .the. publicâ is a houseboat. The
boat Is called , "Aunt Polly" and Is a
houseboat only in the sense that slen
der lines have been sacrificed to roomi
ness of cabin and deck./ The "Aunt
Polly" has a staunch, sea-going hull, is
powerfully engined and Is capable of
traveling at high speed. During the
summertime Mr. Gillette takes long
cruises in her.' This actor's second
horde is among the pine trees in the
hill country of South Carolina. A little
log ; cabin ; sets far back from main
traveled '; highwaysâ -this Is his refuge
from all care and weariness. The little
cabin In the hills sees him but seldom

which may not be neglected. The third
of William ; Gillette's homes Is his old
home.' His sister and her family still
occupy the old Gillette; homestead In

\u25a0 i The new 'Belasco play for Blanche
Bates will \u25a0 be ; laid in the far West, and
done. 1 We have It on the impregnable
testimony of Mr. J. J. Morton that" It
has been ( done.
Mr. Morton tells us that "they trav
eled with their own river" when he was
in the "legit." He did not say what
river.. Probably, however, with a trav
eling company they would have to draw
the line atâ for exampleâ a Missis
sippi. But consider the enterprise,
the enormous expense Involved In thÂ«
carrying of even a small stream IlkÂ©
the San Joaquln \u25a0 from city " to
city. Consider, again, the ' admirable
devotion to art it connotes, the pains
taking and tireless regard for detail.
It was, too, a property very difflcult.to
look after, Mr. Morton assures us. How
they carried it, canned or caged." hÂ«
neglected to, say. But "once, when the
river was" in " the cast, the child* was
slated to sit on its banksâ by the way,
could Mr. Morton's river by an chance
have been, the Wabasb. Itself? One has
heard of â¢ the -Wabash having banks. I
beard myself. I think, at the TlvolL
Some one. probably Teddy Webb, was
asking. why they had built the river
so close to the banks. But there's an
idea. If it were the Wabash. and the
evidence seems to- point that way. why
could not the Central buy it up? Qt
course a secondhand river would not bÂ«
so good as a new one. but It might be
relined and painted over to suit. Mr.
Morton would probably know where it
is and I am sure would be honest
enough to aay if It were likely to be In
good enough condition to use. One of
course wonders .whafr effect a long
course of one-night stands would hayÂ«
even upon i the strongest river. Still,
the Central mechanics are famed - to
their craft, and would doubtless soon
be able to put It into running order. ; ? r
But to the story. Mr. Morton says taÂ«
child was sitting on the banks of their
river By the child sat the faithful dog.
The villain lurked In.tha distance. But
the dog got thirsty. and carelessly drank 1
up the river, and the villain cam* down
right center and pursued thÂ» child. Thar*
seemed to bÂ« no hope, but thÂ« noblÂ« do*
was not thus to.be thwarted. *Jtt*VÂ»
presence of mind phenomenal In tb* air
cumstances,' says Mr. Morton, the wlsÂ«
beast put his paw in his ihroat. coughed
up the river and drowned thÂ» rillaln. /.
This all goes to show, hcnrtmr. that It
is not the easiest thing to run yow own
river. ... \u0084 -:

"It seems not." .
George C. Tyler may be a genius at
casts, but I could have chosen Mrs.
Madge Carr Cook as Mrs. Wlggs my
self. I would not say that I could for
a. moment have divined the delicious
.pathetlco-comical Mis' Hazy in the
handsome Helen Liowell. nor the won
drous Mrs. Eichorn In Helen Redmond,
nor that admirable slouch, Mr. Stubbins,

But Mrs. Cook's Mrs. Wiggs is another
matter. Even the Cook nose, with its

only oae moment's acquaintance. - too,
to find In Mrs. Cook the same sunny,
, kindly wisdom, the same humorous,
hopeful, generous, all-forgiving philos
ophy of the cabbage patch sage. Quite
truÂ«. Mrs. Cook's own prettily formal
manners are not of the larjce. easy-
SOlng slack habit of Mrs. Wiggs, but
otherwise she was born into the part.
It was not at the cabbage patch but
at the St. Francis that Mrs. Cook met
fne the other day. As Mrs. Wiggs her-
Belf would have arranged it there \u25a0 was

says â If she had had time, and Mrs.
Cook's welcome was as genial
We began with a slight disagree
ment. Because Mrs. Wiggs keeps her
"front" in the coal - souttle or la the
back yard I had recklessly called the
good lady slatternly. Mrs. Cook ad
judged it that she had only not the
time to be tidy; that where a woman
Is the mother of many children, cook,
<Jrer smaker, washerwoman, maid, up- :
Etalrs girl and everything else to th*m,
she must not be called untidy, even if
she does keep her hair with, the ooals
and the coal oil can in the bed! She
pointed out that when onÂ« first sees
the Wlggs kitchen it ha* been In the
hands of the little Wiggses for some
hours and one knew what that means.
I did. had had the fun of decorating
kitchens myself and repentantly apol
ogized to Mrs. Wings' interpreter.
"I should not like Mrs. Wlggs." Mrs.
Cook said, "If she were really untidy,
but you know I've often thought â¢what
Mrs. Wiggs would have been with a
little more time and a little . more
money, how she would have kept those
children right up to the notch and had
everything just so. Lâ'" Mrs. Cook
broke off with a broad smile here at
the one that faced her. "Oh, you must
know â In fact,. you see, Mrs. Wiggs is
very real to me. I've lived with her
so long, thought her way,, wondered her
wonderments, that I can hardly believe
that there is *no sech pusson.' "
I told her I could well believe it,', that
there was not a niche of Mrs. Wiggs' part
that did not fit her to a dot.
Mrs. Cook acknowledged chat such had
been said before. Then, glowing like a
girl over it, she told of Nat Goodwin com
ing behind scenes the night before - to
compliment her. "It means so much from
a great artist like he is," she eaid, "and
It meant ever so much more than usual
last night. I was really very - nervous
coming here. In addition to th*> usual first
night nervousness."
"But you have met with . nothing -but
success In the part so far," I protested.,
I did my best, told her the obvious
truth, that her three-year span could
not have been so- terribly distant. It was
her* that we came to Eleanor Robson,
who* has the honor to be mothered by
Mrs. Cook. In miniature, in full-length,
as this, as that, and as her own pretty
self, \u25a0 Miss Robson's sensitive face â¢ and
delicate figure adorned the dressing table.
I asked If the now famous young actress,
coon to be here, had not made her debut
In San Francisco, .. and with "T. Daniel
Frawley*s famous company. *;\u25a0/Â£!Â£
It was at the California, her mother
told me, that Miss -Robson put foot upon
the stage for the , first . time, some seven
or eight years ago.; She came right there
from school. It- was "to please mother,"
that she came at all. She did not care
for the stage,' had no dramatic ambitions,
but juet to be with her mouter, wao was
then, in- her second season here with
Frawley. , \u25a0 â¢â¢-/ â¢
Mrs. Cook laughed gently as she told
of her} daughter's debut. -. It : was in the
second ingenue^ role Mn ."Men 'and Wom

"with "the *â¢ self-possession ;' of .-absolute

"She Is a' person of many- refinements,",

wisdom of her In knowing * what to x sayâ
and what not to say! -Oh, to, ine Mrs.
Wlggs is one -.of 4 the really big women
of the ' world." Â» \ .1
"Is it the character you have liked best
In all your playing?" I asked. Â»"\u25a0â¢.
"Perhaps, yes," . Mrs. Cook considered
It.- "But I like any role that requires
thinking about, working at. I've, worked
hard for a great number of yearsâ since
I was three years old. and that 'lf not
yesterday." Mrs. Cook's piquant 5 glance
here might have been coquetry if I had
been a man. '.V'-V->>
"Oh, she Is a big woman In every way,"
Mrs. Cook went on.' "You remember
where the husband comes home?- Of
course, - recreant" husbands .'â¢ are | forgiven
every day. . but â¢ not in Mrs. Wiggs' way.
You remember, how it' is. done? 'Don't
know how to tell you what I've I been do
ing, Nancy.' Wiggs stammers. 'You don't
have to,' she. Just says. She forgives
himâ and there's no lecture,"
"But- is .that good far the -Mr.
Wlggsesâ " "
"It seems about as. good as the other
way," she laughedâ euch a round, warm,
sudden little ripple.'*. Then seriously again.
"And then there Is Mrs. Wiggs' crowning
fineness, the taking, la* of that illegamate
child. Not only the \ sentimental pain it
meant, yon know, but one more to work
for. to clothe, to feed, and..- that one the
child. of ; her husband arid another \u25a0 wom
an." ' ,"."\u25a0:.- ." .'-Vv~"- - : â¢ -.- \u25a0 â¢\u25a0

Mrs. Wlggs herself might have talked of
tho other woman's goodness, -"have you
noticed that Mrs. .Wlggs never talks about
herself? You actually know nothing about
her own personal struggle only on the one
occasion when the husband leaves her,
and she disco .ers that his- return'... was
only an accident. Then she just saysâ
'alter. I have been working for the child
ren all these years.! '.' \u25a0 ' > .
."It would be well for a good many of
us to remember. Mrs. "Wlggs: 'Don't get
sorry for yourself "â
"Wouldn't - it? That's just it,", Mrs.
Cook settled it. "We all make sacrifices,
don't we? But don't we let people know
about them?" ;
Mrs.. Cook's quaint, sly, kind glance
caught me unawares, and I acknowledged
that we did, but . forthwith determined
that one of. us wouldn't until next time.

recognition, if . not desired, after \u2666 the

HOME FOR TEA
"Wednesday evening next the Army

of the Golden West, will take a benefit
at the Grand Opera-house, the pro
gramme for which will be. Denis O'Sul
livan In his perfect , performance of
Shaun the Post In "Arrah-Na-Pogue."
This parlor was originally composed of
Native Sons who fought In the late
Spanish T Amerlcitn War. They started
out full of hope and ambition, but mis
fortune overtook them and the numer
ous sick calls upon their.treasury left It
almost empty. They then opened their
charter and permitted any one who was
a native of California to join. They
have been steadily growing, and now
have a membership of 135. The follow
ing are the officers of the parlor: Past
president, I* 1* Hunter; president, F. R.
Sutton; first vice president, H. J. Back
ing; second vice president, J. M. Glen
nan; third vice president. A. L. Eisner;
recording secretary, "W. L. Coffey; finan
cial secretary, George H. Allen; treas
urer, A. R. Farless: marshal. H. S. Sut
ton; inside sentinel, E. S. Norton; out
side sentinel, J. H. Murray; trustees-^-
H. G. Leffmann, T. A. Kerrigan and Da
vid Mann; surgeons^ â John W. ;Sm!tn,
Theodore Rethers and Louis H. Granig.
The amount realized from the benefit
will be devoted to the sick fund of the
parlor, and when it Is stated that moqt
of the members who are In need from
this source owe their sufferings to in
juries sustained by them in fighting for
Uncle Sam, public sympathy will at
once be enlisted.

that â¢ has existed between Mrs. Lulie
Mayall and; . her . husband, Herschel ]
iMayall^theieadins man at the Cenrt.il
f Theater, culminated yesterday in a suit
I^or : maintenance brought against tht
i. leading man." \u25a0- - -
-â¢Ffom'time toftime, it appears, since
the actual' separation of the couple in
April ; of -tliis.y fear.'; the actor has sent
his wife $30 a week, and the intention
I of the suit, according to, the fair Dlain
tiff's attorneys. Garoutte & Goodwin,
Is to force payment of money regularly.
\u25a0The couple were married in Michlaran
on the 26th day of February. IS9O, At
that time Mrs..Mayall was a successful
Ingenue and*. Mayall was beginning to
make a | reputation. In the suit for
maintenance, the plaintiff alleges that |
hen. husband's present income is over
$500 a- month and that he owns per
sonal, and real property in St.' Vaul,
Minn.v exceeding $10,000 in value- This
property was in the.'hands of the ac
tor's mother, who died a little ovtr a
week ago.
As an adequate sum, the complal-.t
asks that $200 a month be allowed by
the court and a sum of $500 as counsel
fees pending the litigation. - *
| The news of the suit came; as a sur
prise to the defendant and he-Â«ays:hÂ«
will contest the action. Mayall ex
pressed regret that his wife had /taken
euch a course, and while not condemn
ing; her. he said that the suit \flÂ» un
timely and ill-advised. "For two years
the couple have been living unhappily,
owing to the rumored infatuation oi the
leading man for an actress 'at present
in the Central Theater stock.
The following suits for divorce were
filed .yesterday: William G. Wlttman
from I Sarah Wittman, alleging deser
tion;, Eva from Nathan Scheellne, fail
ure tos provide.

THE STORY OF SWEET SOPHY
FOR THE WOMEN
WHO WANT TO
REDUCE.
'-yHE Trans-Mississippi Congress has responded to the power and
i persuasion of public sentiment in its resolution demanding "a
comprehensive immigration law, framed to remove all "unrea
sonable restrictions, but to exclude all undesirable persons bf every
nation." That is a square deal for all nations. It puts them upon
a perfect equality. It will put a stop to one class of aliens comiHV
here. and immediately starting a clamor for the exclusion of another
class of aliens. All will be treated alike. .If /the demand l of tKe
congress had gone further and been made 'to cover the' right to de
port certain classes of all nationalities, it would ' have. been propciv
Our Federal courts are just now busy with; a gang of scoundrels*
who by perjury secured fraudulent naturalization papers in order
to enable them to get 1 licenses as ship pilots^ mates;; and ; masters,
positions by law reserved to; our own " citizens.^ These; criminals
should first be imprisoned and at- the : end of" their term "should 'be
deported, sent back to the country they came from, their hides
A SQUARE DEAL FOR ALL.
A NARCHISTIC philosophy in order to be perfectly consistent
l\ must needs discountenance bomb throwing, because to thrpw
\u25a0* V- bombs is to try to control men by terror. Elisee Reclus, the
great geographer and writer, whose recent death makes a gap.in
the intellectual world, was an ideal anarchist, in- the sense of thus
refusing to rule by bombs. He might be called a radical and ex
treme anarchist, but as a matter of personal preference and teach
ing of what true anarchy means he stopped short of .using the "in
fernal machine." He jumped over that item, and then went on
toward the extreme of ideal anarchy by refusing to disapprove of
bomb throwing if any one else did it. To some people that might
seem an inconsistent mental attitude ;^but,. instead of being contra
dictory, it is the very essence of anarcl^v According to that school
you have no business trying to prevent other people from doing
what they want to do, even though personally you dislike it.
Reclus is deemed by some to be the greatest of anarchists. . It
is claimed that , to him, more than any other single worker for the
cause, is due the origin and spread of the movement. Certainly in
scholarship he was of high place among them. "The Earth and
Man" was the broad science which he studied at the University of
Berlin under a master of it, Karl Ritter, -and the pupil later took
the masters place and filled it with much more cleverness. 'He
became the foremost man of the world in that study. His. immense
work, "The Universal Geography," made his reputation, â¢ and the
same subject interested him until his final work at an advanced age
which he called by his favorite expression, "Earth and Man." He
possessed the somewhat rare combination of talents which made
his scientific works also literature! He could make what he knew
pleasantly readable, and put it into such language as would give his
works permanency. When the French Government put him in
prison he set to work to teach his fellow prisoners everything from
the alphabet to scientific geography. He disliked the thought, of
violence so much that all his life he was. a vegetarian; so that no
life might be killed for his sustenance.
One of the most clear-cut works for the cause, of anarchy was
his organizing the Internationale in Spain in 1868.- The Spanish
workmen have ever since been true to it, and for this reason have re
frained from forming a socialist party. He was not a theoretical an
archist merely, for he practiced what he preached by pairing off
his daughters with the partners whom they chose without the for
mality of marriage. '
It would appear that his philosophy of anarchy must be closely
allied with the philosophical and religious opinions of Tolstoi as to
complete denial of the right of human beings to control each other
by force. That there is so?ne strong and beautiful element of truth
in this Tolstoi idea of non-control and non-resistance we must 'ad
mit,, and to what. extent evolution is going to find it practical of
admission into civilization must be of more or less interest to all." \u25a0
ELISEE RECLUS.
Two notes of deep contrition r went between the two next day, -*'
And by a strange, coincidence they passed upon \u25a0 the way. . .
Sweet Sophy wrbterVTm; so ashamed!- I hope -you'll never tell. "-
Youns Abner wrote : "I much regretâ but, thenâ how.'", could Iâ well,
You know yourselfâ l^might have knownâ here's all that I can do": -
I'll know who wears the; pants before Â«I beat my. next tattoo.". ;, 'â¢".
The years speed. by;< ; those two to-day trot jointly up -life's hill,
And all the neighbor/gossips say sheweafs the trousers 1 still. -
She was the sister of my chum, a pretty girl and neat. â¢\u25a0
Her age was sixteen years or so, when girls are hard, to beat; .
She looked with longing envy on our little "cooriing" larks, v
As was sinfully apparent from her casual /remarks. '
"But, oh," she said. Vif I -were seenâ oh, -no, I dare not go,
For I'd be caught as sure as fate, my . Skirts would hinder so!"
The logic brought to< bear on her I am not. here to tell /.,
But. in Ker brother's pantaloons she looked exceeding well. \u25a0
It pains me much .to. here, narrate that on that dismal night
Young Abner Thomson was on guard, and he: was not polite. ' '
He got his eye upon a boyâ that is, he thought he didâ
And when he caught that blessed boyâ my tears will . not, be hidâ â
Upon the attic of his pants he beat a wierd tattoo
That Sophy was within those .pants perhaps is plain to you.
She let out one distressing shriek that re'en the dead might hear;
And which of them was/scared* the most to me.was never clear. :
I CANNOT tell this little' tale :. without a sob of woe, \u25a0\u25a0. .- :
_^EPX_lhough__tlic^xc3.r.s-.li? vc passed" since then, the* weary, years and slow,
: Yef7jade<i fec&lhfc'tTo'n" halts and wipes its weeping eyes, .-â¢â¢ :
Recalling that sad episode beneath the Eastern skies.-
We boys "cooned" watermelons then from Deacon Thomson's.field,
And melons sweet as those we "cooned" no later years "can yield.
But this is foreign to, my -tale, "which . \u25a0should Tnarrate. the sin, 'â ;
And also the sad episode that Sophy -figured- in. -
rj^HE Czar has been forced to yield, so far as to .form a pretense
I of popular government. It is a pale and elusive shadow.- fln
* stead of basing the rights of the people upon a 'constitution,
with courts to interpret it and a co-ordinate parliament, he. grants
to his subjects the privilege of electing a "consultative assembly.":
This body is to have the privilege of preliminary elaboration of
measures and examination of the budget. This seems to mean that
the assembly may propose and discuss laws, without the power, to
enact or make them effective, and may examine the budget, without
the power to amend it or to control the appropriation of the public
revenue to any purpose whatever.
The imperial decree leaves in. doubt the inclusion of some parts
of the empire in the scheme. The Grand Duchy, of Finland, al
ready robbed of its ancient rights by royal duplicity, is expressly
excluded from participation in the assembly in matters affecting
the whole empire. The empire, however, will continue to tax Fin
land for the benefit of the royal exchequer,; and to impress Finns
into the army to be slaughtered for the empire. The scheme leaves
the Russians still without a bill of rights, and "does not. at all limit the
autocracy of the Czar. The people are not sheltered' under a single
" "thou shalt not," to sta3' the arm of the Government./ There is no
Runnymede and no Magna Charta, no guarantee of freedom of con
science in religion, nor of personal action in secular matters,
j The elective institution formed by the Czar is evidently to con
sist of one house only, though the Czar calls it "the lower house."
Evidently he regards the Council of State as the upper house, and
as he dominates the Council he. is the upper house himself. This
single house feature robs the scheme of every parliamentary feature.
The Italian republics failed through having a single house parlia
ment. It had legislative and executive power, but was without the
necessary checks and balances imposed by a second house. Since
that experience it has come to be, a law in civics that a parliamentary
body, to be useful or permanent, must consist of two houses^chosen
by different methods and varying in tenure. But Nicholas was not
creating a parliament and so did not need to* study that subject.
The delegates to his Douma, or assembly, will be much in the same
position as our territorial delegates in the House of Representatives,
having the right of debate but not the right to vote.
Still it is a step. King John did not foresee the present govern
ment of the British empire by a committee of Parliament when he
surrendered to the Barons and gave them a voice in the govern
ment. The security of rights in Magna Charta was the gecm of
evolution. The Czar's scheme gives the people no rights except
the right to vote for delegates who have in turn the right to talk.
Yet in the far future freedom may issue from this inauspicious be
ginning. Whatever benefit it may be to the people they owe not
to the Czar but to Japan. The thick skin of the Romanoff pride
has been pierced by reverses- on land and sea, and by humiliations
the most distressing. At the same time the people rejoiced, for the
disasters were to the Grand Dukes and their fear of the autocracy
was less with every defeat in the East. It is probable that if the
peace conference had not been arranged, by this time the army
of Linevitch would have been wiped out and Nicholas would have
granted the substance instead of "the shadow of popular govern-
Having the Czar on the run it is probable that a little further"
revolutionary rushing may make him jettison some more institu
tions of greater value than what he has now thrown overboard.
Japan may justly claim in history the credit for whatever good
fellows this first evidence that the autocracy is aware that the Rus
sian people exist for any purpose except to be plundered by the
Grand Dukes.

THERE once, lived a girl who was a

on housekeeping, diet, education,

delight In; expounding to.hex family and
friends. ... . -^ -. :
Now, it so happened that, during a
sojourn in a distant city, she met a very
nice young - man who became enamored
of her and whose affection she was In
clined to return. But: as she had a pet

withhold ra-^deflnite answer -to his - en

"Although I love you, I. cannot answer
you in the affirmative until your affection

{{ |-*v n> It ever .occur to you." asked
I 1 the educated , barber, "how
*"â . much a man who stands In a
tonsorlal establishment all day may
learn? Now in this neighborhood there
come here regularly gentlemen of re
finement and culture. We cater to no
other class. It keeps me busy reading
to have enough topics on hand to talk
about.' The barber is not responsible
for all the conversation in the shop.
As a matter of fact, he does not start
the conversation in most cases. No.
Blr; I would not presume to engage a
gentleman in conversation unless he
first began it. The up-to-date barber
must know all about the last Interest
ing murder case, and when a customer
says, 'Now what do you think of thatâ
do you think the tall man with the red
beard or the short man With the black
mustache did the shootingr the lather
artist must be able to give a quick and
Intelligent answer.
The operator at the next chair to mÂ«
had an embarrassing experience just
now. One of our beat customer* came
in, and It waa evident to me that he
felt very strongly about revelations
concerning society persons being black
mailed. My associate. I saw at a glance,
waa not in touch with the situation.
I gave him a signal to say yes and he
could make no mistake. So he started
up assenting vigorously, saying that it
was a shame and that the rascals
should be brought to justice. He did It
very well, and after we were alone I
heartily congratulated him on his ex
ploit, at the same time putting him
en rapport with the situation. The
gentleman who just went out knows all
.about automobiles, and the way I have
been studying the inside of those ve
hicles required mental effort. It pays,
too. for I go to shave him at his house,
and a barber who can talk discerningly
; about carburetors and spark plugs and
such things is vajuable as a conver
sational aid â and gets a liberal tip.
"Yes, sir, the modern barber is all
things. to all men.. Every customer has
something which he likes to talk about
and he starts up the topic often to let
loose his enthusiasm or to express his
Indignation. If the San Franciscos
have lost and he feels that the situa
tion with regard to the pennant is dis
graceful, the baseball enthusiast finds
in the barber an intelligent and appre
ciative listener to opinions about um
pires and managers and Ice wagons and
bunches of errors. 1
"One of the favorite topics of conversa
tion which engages the attention of the
regular customer Is the nationality of his
barber. For that reason I always keep
posted on everything pertaining to Italy,
for although I was not born there I am so
Italian in my appearance that the gentle
men think that I only recently landed. I
am well versed now in Roman history, the
beauties of Florence and the Italian
school of music. That answers very well
for at least three customers.' one an
Italian banker, another an architect and
the third a* German professor of music
who Is often pleased to tell how Wagner
excftls â¢ anything In the way of Italian
opera ever produced.
"That young man who Just went out iÂ»
connected with a- neighboring dancing
academy. It U fortunate that X saved
that dipping about the new waltzes..
Anticipating that he would be In soon I
read It with great car a. I think It shotild

"Barbers are good . conversationalists
because they have the pleasure of meet
ing so many men of education and cul
ture. . Every man has . som* subject In
which be U specially well Informed, and
be is always glad to enlighten thÂ» barber.
In that way, sir, this upholstered chair
becomes a college, and the lather Is a dis
sertation and. the pass of * rasor may In
itself comprehend a , learned thesis. The
humble . shop becomes \u25a0 a university, a
haircut Is a eauserle and a shampoo, the
equivalent to a lecture at the Sorbonne.

I have shaved -William Dean Howells
many/ times, but X . am Interested In a
special branch of surgery also, for a dis
tinguished specialist always comes to my
chair. All men are glad, to talk to the

their minds, so he not only learns, but is
able to pass along some of the ideas
which he acquires."

Serpent" was done sometime before that.
One would think that her . Inspiration to
invent a ! story and her ,-. energy to spread
it upon pages would.be exhausted by the
continuous output arid the lapse of ytars
(sher was born in 1837), but .'in . 1903. she
wrote "The Conflict," : and In" 1904 "A

\u25a0 Thomas was born In East Friesland in
1535. He emigrated to New York in 1845.
He played the violin well when he was
five years old. He perfected himself in
that, and then passed from the ambition
Of being master of a solo instrument to
that 6f being a player' upon the hun
dred players of a great orchestral choir.
In 1862 the big ambition came to devote
his energies to the- cultivation of the
public : taste in instrumental music. In
the long struggle to do this the convic
tion, came to him that he must have that
untrammeled orchestral home. -The-Chi
cago Orchestral Association gave It to
him. Through thirteen years' difficul
ties they struggled to establish the in
stitution. It was December before the
dedication concert took . place. . Eight
thousand subscribers, rich and poor, had
given (750,000. In less than a month from
the time of the dedication concert Theo
dore Thomas was dead. It was forty
two years' span from the inception of his
larger ambition and this consummation
of it in the Chicago Orchestra. It might
seem a cruel fate that thus let him labor
so long and with such admirably per
sistent faith, and then not let him live to
enjoy the accomplished taskâ but listen

to his wife about their White Mountain

worth stating in general terms: A man
loves a Kirl, but his. love Is egoistic and
preconceived: she loves him with all her
heart, but for his own sake she will not
let him love her falsely; she repudiates
that sort of love; thus a conflict arises in
the man's mind between his preconcep
tions of love and love Itself. The issue
is whether hg will put down the precon
ception, destroy the egoism and win a
\ moral victory over himself which shall lift
Kirn to the girl's level. This is a sort of
situation that is not frequent in recent
fiction. It sets Mr. Hewlett \u25a0 apart as a
man who thinks through his narrative.
We notice it in two things: First, he
recognizes that the. attraction of -woman
for man is a deeper and subtler thing than
a mere straight pull on his sensibilities;
second, that the test of a man is how.
when his preconceptions meet with fact,
he endures his ordeal."
LJTERARY NOTES
The present' Is the twenty-third edl-*
tion. It is now issued biennially about
the month of July in each odd num
bered year. On its title page we get
this quotation. from Milton:
â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ . â¢ to know
That which before us lie* In dally UfÂ« .
Is the prime wisdom; what Is more, is fume.
Or emptiness, or fond Impertinence:
And renders us, in things that most concern.
Unpraetls'd. onprTared. and still to *eek.
Nothing could be more apt than the
, two-line quotation which begins tho
! preface: "Knowledge 13 of two kinds:
"We know a subject ourselves or wÂ©
know where we can find information
on it."
Were It not for that second kind of
knowledge probably some of the moat
learned .in . all trades and professions
, would â¢ soon be lost in a maze of In
: accuracies and a confusion of half-for
! gotten data.; and per consequence their
' occupation wtmld be gone. To knfcvv
! "The Statistician and Economist" is to
have a very important part of that sec
; ond kind of knowledge. . Its office Is
"to condense and represent in conveni
ent form for reference the practical
facts of knowledge and science." v '

$3 50; leather. $4 50.)
Although thÂ« work fills two large
volumes, the actual autobiography is
little more than one hundred pages.
.The larger portion of the first volume
is taken up with reminiscences and ap
preciation by George P. Upton. These
are exceedingly good and very neces
sary, for Mr. Thomas is so modest and
â¢so brief that what he has written 'â¢ of
himself would not nearly suffice -us.
The i-econfi volume is entirely devoted
to his concert programmes. The men
tion of the word "programme**, is a re
minder of the Joyous way this great
orchestral leader exulted when he
reached that stage in his -successful
career when "the attraction was suffi
cient to lustlfy me for the first time in
my life in making programmes without
making allowance for ignorance or
prejudice.* The occasion .was when he
was familiarizing the public every
where with Wagner's music, in 1872-7 J.
He had in combination with his con
cert company the two â¢sreat instrumen
talists. Rubinstein and Weiniarlwski,
who were brought over to America by
Maurice Grau. "Programmes of works
of the highest standard, rendered by
i^cth artists and such an orchestra,
Hrere a revelation everywhere and
made a lasting impression. They gave
this country the great artistic impetus
for which it seemed at last to bo ripe."
The brief one hundred pages of au
tobiography are yet sufficient to^ give
us one of the great stories of American
history, the narration of a highly gift
ed man's right use of his , talents, a big
ambition patiently and strenuously per
sisted In for lifty years, till at last tha
aim of his life was achievedâ and that
aim one of national importance and": in
fine arts high behoof. This with the
human touch of telling of the strain
of the difficulties, the alternation of
hope and despondency, and the moral of
it all â the method of how he did it,
and the inspiration that was behind the
doing, namely, a lofty purpose of serv
ing art for humanity's sake,/ "His
greatest pleasure was to render perfect
music perfectly." Hi s life's ambition
was to train the nation to appreciate
fine music. To do this he wished to es
tablish a permanently homed orches
tra, endowed and managed beyond the
chance of commercialism dominating
Its art. These dreams he made reali
ties. How he did it is stated- in his
own words, "by. perseverance, hard
*Â£ork and stern discipline." It Is the
old, old story^pf talents God-given but
Ptill the loyÂ«w gift left suspended until i
the donee has acceptably accepted it

trusted powers into the effectiveness
/- JZ"^ I"**''*1 "**''** 1 conductor In the world ia Theo
"The Master of Music" is the title
given by Henry Van Dyke to his in
rncmoriam poem to the famous or
chestral conductor, Theodore Thomas,
who died suddenly on January 4 last,
a Â»d the account of whose life work,
called "Theodore Thomas. A Musical
Autobiography," is now published, not
only to the delight of music-lovers, but
to the pleasing of ail those readers who
like a biography of a man who achieves
something unusually worthy by un
usual persistence and energy.
In the poem Henry Van Dyke tells
us of how the power of architect,
painter and sculptor and bard lires
forever in temple and picture and
et&tue and song, and then reminds us
by contrast of how the works of the
Â»:naster of music vanish away, "the
works that he wrought in the air as
a palace of dream." but now goner-all
ffone. "like thÂ« light on the cloud at
the close of the day." He tells of how
the billows of musical sound followed
nis will as the sea was ruled by the
prophet of old. but * now mute are the
shores where the mystical harmonies
rolled." After he has made us deeply
regret this transiency, he comÂ«s to us
In the last stanza with the consolation
that the music has a permanency in
,the effect It wrought:
3s*aj\ but etni are the heart* that were filled
. w:ta that marvelous t*Â»:
Furer and deeper forerer tbÂ« tides of their
being shall roll.
Bounding with echoes of Joy, and of thanks, O
Alacter. to thÂ«e â
Music immorUJ endures in the depths of the
human soul.
Many great musicians we have had,
and Individuals have their great music
masters, but the- unique position
Thcm&s held made him the music mas
ter. In an especial sense, of the na
,tion â the instructor of the American
people collectively. It was his high
aspiration to be that, and his brilliant
success in the role, that will make his
memory most widely esteemed by his
countrymen and cause history to give
him a singularly prominent place
emong the human instruments of our
artistic development. On the long
ro.-id â a whole half-century long, over
which he passed in the struggle to
achieve his purpose, there were many
tiraes when he was despondent, almost
'c^pairing. So we may easily com
prehend that he spoke not only in sym
pathy for others, but out of a personal
experience in the words:
The power of good music! "Who among- us
\u25a0 can tell or measure it? Who shall ear how
cany hearts it has soothed, how many tired
brain* It has rested, how many sorrow* It
has taken away? It is like the power of con
science â mighty, immeasurable.
One of the most entertaining passages
of the book is the account of some of his
methods of thus being music master to
the people collectively and training them
to appreciate the best art. He did not
wish merely to make them like music for
amusement's cake, but to instill into them
a. sincere love for good music, a deep and
earnest regard for the works of the mas
"term. He would attract the people to at
tention by playing them light and popu
lar melodies, and then he would sandwiofi
in something finer, but more difficult for
them to appreciate. "Presently there ap
peared a symphony movement, something
by Raff, Spohr, Schumann, Schubert or
Beethoven, repeated over uid over in
connection with the light stuff also re
peated ' over and over, until the people
found the .latter did not stand repetition
like the former, in which they discovered
new beauties at each performance." Thus
he went about his great undertaking on
the principle of persuasion. He adapted
to his art purpose thÂ© widely useful pro
cess in all science and knowledge of de
veloping the unknown from the known.
How Intense was his conviction that
the American people needed to h&ve their
cense of music developed from the con
dition in which he found it to where they
could enjoy the finer forms of it, and
that he had a great mission in training
them up to those , delightful yet undis
covered heights, may b* gathered from
the enthusiasm of a few of his sen
tences. Thus: "â¢ â¢ The man who does
\j. understand Beethoven and has not
y-en under his spell has not half lived his
life. The master works of instrumental
music are the language of the soul and
express more than any other art. Light
music, 'popular,* so called, is the sensual
Fide of the art and has more or less devil
â¢n it." In a letter to Mr. George P. Up
ton, who is the editor of the autobiog
raphy, he Bays: â¢â¢ â¢ â¢ it is also a great
drawback In this country that the mu
sical public is either too busy or too
phlegmatic to treat music as an art, but
look upon it only as an amusement or a
pastime.**

Police Have \o Intention of Running
Risk of Disturbance aa Did Au
thorities In London.
PARIS, Aug. 12.â The outlook for Dow
ie's projected crusade against Parisian
vice is more than unfavorable at the pres
ent moment. Although a few of the"for
mer meetings here addressed b^ Elijah II
were orderly on the whole and there was
-practically no public Interest taken, yet
the police have no intention of running
any risk of such disturbances as have
happened during the Dowie campaign In
London. Therefore, counting on the ad
mirable attention the French proprietors
give their chief of police, the latter has
simply strongly "advised" the owners of
all Paris halls not to accept any offers
coming from the Chicago prophet. .
Dowie will be reduced to holding his
salvation meetings on the open square,
which will bring him so sharply under
police surveillance that his discomfiture
may be discounted in advance. As far
as Dowie is concerned, Paris wickedness
is likely to continue for some, time to
come.
Happiness ?Is not In having T|hat we

proceedings, cfiiarglngr violation of < the
order of District Judge John F. J , Philips,
issued . in * March, "1^02; restraining the
defendants from giving rebates vio

cago and Alton, the Chicago, Burlington
and^ Quincy, the Union Pacific, the Chi
cago, Rock Island and Pacific and the
Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe railroad
companies. ' .. â¢
The contempt proceedings allege spe
cifically in the case of -the Chicago and
Alton that the company granted rebates
amounting to many thousands of dol
lars on the shipments, of agricultural
and farming-machinery to the Interna

and controls the , Deerlng ""* Harvester

Railroad Comparty to 'â¢ file with the In
terstate Commerce Commission pre
tended (Joint tariffs on. _ joint 'freight
rates effective from Chicago, to Missouri
River points, for the express purpose of
evading the restraining order, and that
the Alton agreed and did in' fact give to
the 7 International Harvester. Company
25 per cent of said pretended joint tar
iff rates. The proceedings against the
Burlington Railroad are 'practically
identical with those against the Alton.
The proceedings against the Missouri
Pacific, ,the Rock Island and the Santa
Fe railroads allege: that- In 'like manner
these companies violated the \u25a0.restrain
ing" order, by 'giving rebates to the
Hutchinson (Kans.) Salt Company, in
collusion with the Hutchinson and Ar
kansas River Railroad, which -latter
company Is controlled and operated by
the salt company. These railroad com
panies are alleged to have given the
salt company 25 per cent of a pretend
ed joint tariff rate upon salU routed to

The accident was witnessed by other
automohilists. who succeeded in rescu
ing tho five occupants of the "Walsh,
machine, not. however, without great
dliflculty, due to the fact that all the
members of the party were lying be
neath the heavy car. The water in thÂ«
creek was not deep, and to this circum
stance is due in part the rescue.
Walsh, who was 18 years old, was
not instantly killed, but died soon
after he wai taken from the water. It
was learned later that as the automo
bile crashed over the bridge his head
came In contact with an Iron beam.
The occupants of the car were on
their way to attend a luncheon given
at the Clambake Club near Eastern
Point by Mrs. Clement C Moore. Tho
accident happened when the car. a
forty-horsepower vehicle, was speeding
rapidly down a hill. The Injured wers
treated temporarily at near-by cottages.
Physicians stated that all probably
would recover.
Vinson Walsh was the son of Thomas
F. , "Walsh of Washington, the million
aire Colorado mine owner. He .was 13
years of age and was preparing to enter
Yale University in the fall. He was a

purchased 'a string of polo ponies for
him.
Mrs. James Kernochan is well known
as a cross-country rider. She came hero
from Hempstead. Lul.,' recently to visit

Then ensued a long distance conver
sation between the President and the
Russian envoys, the message being
transmitted through Secretary Barnes
here and through Assistant Secretary
of â¬tate Peirce at Portsmouth. The
Until the present time President
Roosevelt has refrained from any ac
tion, even by indirection, that might be
construed as interference by tha pleni
potentiaries. He announced at the be
ginning of the negotiations that neither
by word nor act would he participate in
the proceedings of the conference, al
though he made it perfectly clear to the
envoys of both Russia and Japan that
he would be ready at any time to assist
them in a proper way in the great work
which they have been designated by
their respective Emperors to undertake.
In anticipation, however, of failure
of the envoys to agree upon certain of
the articles which they had agreed to
consider and in expectation that he
might be appealed to by the one side
or the other before the conclusion of
the conference the President has been
In communication with the great neu
tral powers. His purpose was to enlist
their support in a final effort to secure
en honorable peace. With King Ed
ward be communicated because Great
Britain is a practical ally of Japan, and
with President Loubet because France
is the nearest friend of Russia. Ger
many, too, was appealed to and Em
peror William is exerting his Influence
for peace.
PRESIDENT APPEALS TO JAPAX.
Through Mr. Griscom. the, American
Minister at Tokio. the President also
has been working, but it cannot be
vj^certalned whether his efforts have
Tieen directed toward a reduction of the
demands of Japan or not. It is sur^
mised, however, that be has urged the
Japanese Government so to modify its
terms as to render it easier for Russia
to accede to them. Embassador Meyer
also has been in communication with
the St. Petersburg Government.
Baron Kaneko, a confidential repre
sentative of the Japanese Government
in this country, has been keeping In
close touch with President Roosevelt
since the ceace negotiations were â¢in
their inciplency. For the fourth time
in as many weeks and for the second
time within a week he was in confer
ence with the President last evening.
Neither he nor the President would dis
close the nature of their interview, but
it Is slgniucent that the Baron had
scarcely started for New York before
the President's interest in the negotia
tions at Portsmouth became active. He
sent a long and important message. to
Mr. de Witte and Baron Rosen. Secre
tary Pelrce's reply to the message was
communicated to the President by tele
phone from the executive office In Oys
ter Bay village.
Baron Rosen, Russian Embassador to
the United States and second V)f the
Russian Emperor's envoys to the peace
conference, was with President Roose
velt an_,*our. late this . afternoon at
Sagamb"re Hill. He came to Oyster
Bay by invitation of the President, not
merely to discuss with him the situa
tion, but to have presented to him by
the President a proposition which, it is
hoped, may solve the differences which
have arisen between the plenipoten
tiaries of the two Governments. After
his conference with the President,
Baron Rosen left immediately for his
summer home at Magnolia, Mass.,
where he and Mr. de Witte, the prin
cipal Russian envoy, expect to spend
Sunday. Neither President Roosevelt
nor Baron Rosen would discuss even
in the most general terms the details
or result of their conference. The Em
bassador will present the President's
proposition to Mr. de Witte to-night
and the likelihood is that it will be
transmitted to Emperor Nicholas.
CRISIS TO COME OX TUESDAY.
v On the result of Its consideration will
f^cpend the fate of the peace confer
- tnce. It Is not improbable that before
thÂ« envoys meet next Tuesday morning
It may be known with some degree
of definiteness whether there in to be
peace in the Far East or a continuance
of the war.
OYSTER BAT, Aug. 19. â President
floosevelt Is exercising every particle
of his great influence to prevent a rup
ture of the peace conference at Ports
mouth. He is engaged in a supreme
effort to induce the envoys of the bel
ligerent Governments to compromise
their differences and reach an agree
ment that will result in a "just and
lasting peace."
In this effort he has the active and
cordial support of Great Britain/France
acd Germany. Tremendous and world
wide pressure is being brought to bear
upon the Governments at St. Peters
burg and Tokio to not permit the Wash
ington conference to fail of affirmative
results. It can be said that there is
ground for the hope that it will not
fail.

during the , summer, \u25a0 thence to Boston,
where he boarded a limited; train for New
York. At 2:50 o'clock this -afternoon the j
train made a special" stop. at New Roch
elle, N. V., where Embassador Rosen, and
the Prince left it and boarded the naval
yacht Sylph,; which the President had dl
j rected to be sent to New Rochelle to con-
J.vey the Russian envoys. to Oyster Bay. j
1 Bearing Baron Rosen" and his secre
tary, the Sylph entered Oyster Bay and I
cast anchor below : Sagamore Hill at 4:17 !
| o'clock. Five minutes later the.. Presi
i dent's callers were en route in the
j Sylph's motor boat to the J. West Roose- j
! velt pier. As he landed Baron Rosen was
! almost brusque in his refusal to discuss
his mission. They entered one of the
President's carriages, which \ was await
ing them, and were > driven to Sagamore
Hill. They remained with -the President
about "an hour. At the conclusion of the :
conference, while i Baron Jlosc-n still de- !
clinod to talk of his visit, his demeanor
was changed absolutely. His face was
wreathed in smiles and; his manner -was
quite genial. -The. interview evidently had â¢
been. entirely satisfactory to him. |
-, The Russian visitors "were conveyed to]
the Sylph in the motor boat and . shortly, j
before 6 o'clock the yacht weighed an
j.chor and steamed out of-the bay. Her;
destination; was not disclosed, but it was â¢
supposed to be some point on thfe New I
England coast where Baron Rosen \ and
Prince Koudacheff might catch a train
,that would enable them to reach Magno
lia to-nighf.
' MAT OPEN AVAY TO PEACE. v
President Roosevelt said this evening he
would not discuss in any way his confer
ence with Baron Rosen. The intimation
conveyed by his remarks was that pub
: licity at this moment might imperil, if
not wreck entirely, the negotiations pend
ing. The President would not indicate
his opinion of the result of the negotia- \
tions. â¢" : I
It is quite evident from the trend of
events to-day, which made. Oyster Bay â¢
for an hour the center of the peace pro
ceedings, that the Russian envoys are
now in possession of information that
will assist them materially in- concluding
an agreement with the Japanese pleni-j
potentiaries. \u25a0 ' . . j
It would be futile to speculate as to the
nature of this information or as to the
charcter of the proposition the President!
submitted to Baron Rosen. But it can be
| Baid that if the conferees, after commu- .
j nicating with their governments, are able -j
j to proceed with their labors next' Tues- â¢
! day without a rapture it will be due to ;

Yesterday's sessions of the workers of
the Christian church of the world were
marked by Intense enthusiasm and re
ligiotia vigor. The culmination of this in
tense real took place In the afternoon,
when the 2000 women in attendance at the
meeting of the Christian Womens' Board
of Missions rose en masse and pledged
themselves to see to it that $100,000 was
raised outside of the regular sources of
income by the one hundredth anniver
sary of this body, in the year 1909. State
delegations arose, one by- one, and offered
their Â«upport, and when Indiana, Ohio
and Illinois 'promised to furnish a total
of $45,000 of this fund the applause reigned
for five minutes
The Christian church convention is a
noteworthy one in every respect. All the
brilliant stars of the organization are
here to tell of their experiences and to
plan work for the future. Nearly 10,000
people are in attendanceâ a remarkable
number when the distance from' head
quarters is noticed. Young missionaries
about to' start^ on soul-saving Journeys,
old missionaries' with strange tales of for
eign lands; pastor* of a thousand flocks,
congregational representatives from every
part of the United States, all are here to
work- for the advancement of the Chris
tian church.
$130,000 FOR SEMINARY.
A feature of the morning meeting was
the announcement made. by President H.
D. McAneny of the Berkeley Bible Sem
inary, who stated that his institution had
been offered a gift of $10,000 by W. L.
Porterfleld. a wealthy telephone capitalist
of Los Angeles, provided $20,000 more was
raised from other sources. The announce
ment was greeted with cheers, and Presi
dent McAneney assured the assemblage
that he would not have the least trouble
5n gathering together the extra amount.
With these two sums the total endow
ment of the Berkeley Bible Seminary will
be $130,000.
At the afternoon session the Woman's

the board. During the session reports
were read from the committees on
evangelism in the United States, on
yonng" people's work, on India, on edu
cational work in the United States and
South America. These .reports all
showed a great growth in all branches
of work and satisfactory financial con
dition.
MISSIONARIES SPEAK. .
One of the features of .the exercises
was the presence, fit many foreign and
home missionaries. Each one graphic
ally recited the conditions, in the field

dent'of the Business Men's Association
of the Christian church. In the report
of the secretary large financial gains

aries "have been sent out "and an addi
tional field secretary has been placed.
- Another branch of these general mis
sionary societies, the American Chris
tian Missionary Society. " met- yesterday

solidation of the Board of Ministerial
RelicT and the National Benevolent
Association.
In the evening the Young People's
Society of Christian Endeavor met at
Woodward's Pavilion. The gathering
was led by National Superintendent
Waggener of Kansas City.
ADDRESS OF MRS. SMITHER.
Mrs. A. C Smither of Los Angeles
made the principal address of the
afternoon. It was entitled "Embassa
dors for Christ." It follows, in part:
"The tllustious apostle Paul, desiring
to convey to the church at Corinth their
feplrltual obligations to the heavenl:
kingdom, used this beautiful and force
ful language: 'We are embassadors
therefor on behalf of Christ, as thougir
God 'were intreating by us."
"The position of an embassador por
trays very clearly the Christian's rela
tionship to the divine kingdom.
"In the first j lace, it is a position of
honor; so when God calls us into co
operation with himself in the adminis
tration of divine affairs he confers on
us great distinction. With every honor,
however, there goes a corresponding re
sponsibility, and as embassadors *of
Christ we assume the same obligations*'
that- Christ himself sustains to the
world. The Lord Jesus came into the
world to seek and save that which was
lost; so upon Individual Christians falls
the sacred task cf proclaiming the gos
ptl.
"That we are the personal representa- ;
lives of Christ in advancing the causa
of righteousness is plainly demonstrated
In his own words to his disciples while
on earth, 'As the. Father has sent me;
so send I you." When a man is appoint
ed to diplomatic service the duties of
his office are purely representative. In
all matters of International import he
must suliserve the highest Interests of
his. country.
"Just so do Christians, as spiritual
cmbassadors. stand betAveen Christ and
the world, recor.cfllngr It to God.
"Tnen. a&aln. to be an embassador of
the Lord's klnerdom means a call to the
highest service that God can require.;
The evangrellzatlon of the world Is the
noblest task of which the uiliid can con
ceive, and at no time In the world's his
tory have the opportunities been so
great for the propagation of the Chris
tlan religion.
"The progress of human events Is
binding together all the nations of the
Â«jarth Into one great family. The United
States, being placed between the two
great waterways of the world's com
merce. Is afforded superior advantages
for reaching the heathen nations. The
recent victories of Japan afford another
opportunity, for Japan In the future
will hold in her hand the destiny of the
Far' East. Bound to the. Anglo-Saxon
race- by the ties of sympathy and re
spect, she Is peculiarly susceptible to
the teachings of Christianity.
"But, however great the opportunity,
.the unevaugrellzed peoples of the earth
can never be redeemed except by the
prayers and efforts of a united-Chris
tendom and the personal sacri.ico of
consecrated m en and women. The-path
way of individual sacrifice has been
giorlried by the feet of many loyal mis
sionaries and heroic martyrs, but to us
Jn the less conspicuous walks of Ufa
comes the same call to heroic service.
Let every Christian be faithful \ to; hl3
God-Riven mission of saving the. world
for Christ."

the 'following dispatch from R. V.
Whiting, his assistant, from Victoria, B.
C, yesterday afternoon:
"Collins committed for extradition.
Judge renders clear and able -opinion
sustaining prosecution's points. Col
lins says" he will take habeas' corpus
proceedings. Shall I remain?" .
.To; which the District Attorney re
plied: Ji. "
"Congratulations. Use ' your own

lows:
-"Collins, committed for extradition."
Local \u25a0 Authorities Notified.
VICTORIA. B. C.. Aug. 19.â George D.
Collins, the lawyer who fled from San
Francisco on July 9 when, on trial for
bigamy and who waa arrested here on
July 12 at the instance of the San Fran
cisco police on a charge of perjury, was
commuted for extradition thla mornin*
by Judge Lampman. The prisoner can
not, : under thÂ« law, \u25a0be surrendered for
fifteen .days and In the meantime will
appeal/ He gave . notice this morning
that he will take habeas . corpus pro
ceedings before another Supreme Court
Judge, two having already refuted to
issue a writ for his release.
- - Judge Lampman, In committing Col-
Una for extradition, said he could not
entertain the prisoner's contentions
that perjury was not an extraditable
offense. As to the alleged contract- of
marriage . with Agnes Newman in 1888,
followed by: the religious ceremony^ of
188 9, when it was alleged the name of
Charlotta Newman had been placed in
the records by mistake, Judge Lamp
man said the evidence of the'prosecu
tion was so' complete that be could not
accept the .evidence of Collins. It was
at variance with that of all other wit
nesses, and:J.'J. Groom, court clerk of
San. Francisco, had sworn* that the In
dorsement of the names "George D. Col
lins" and "Charlotta' Collins" on the
back of the marriage' certificate was In
Collins" handwriting. _ -
It was not alleged that he was one of
the many alleged conspirators, and it
was remarkable, if Collins bad then
married "Agnes Newman, as -he alleged,
that he. should write the name of her
sister Charlotta on the wedding certifi
cate. t The evidence v waa sufficient to
warrant that the prisoner be extradited
and It was his duty_ to \u25a0 notify the ac
cused that he would not be surrendered
for fifteen days. .'
Later it was announced that Collins
will take habeas corpus proceedings be
fore Justice Duff of the Supreme Court.
He Is seeking to be placed In the cus
tody of the Sheriff Instead of being con
fined In the common jail pending the
appeal. â

FOUND DYING
IN HIS ROOM
61-f cial Dispatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO, Aug. 19.--The police de
partment is at work on a mystifying case.
Late this , afternoon the proprietor of the
St." George Hotel," not ' having seen ' one of
his ; guests, Louis Davalanne, for. several
days, tried to rouse him by rapping at his
door, - and -: failing . broke 5 his way.; ingldo.
He | found 'â¢ Davalanne . lying . in bed suffer
ing from -what appeared to be^a'bullet
woundin his left side, but thare was no
sign of blood on any of his garments and
none on the, bed. : '.
A careful^ search of v the apartment
failed to disclose any weapon whatever.
Indeed, ; it appeared that", the 'â¢ undergar
ments upon the wounded; man had been
f reshly,_ put on. He could '- not : be roused
at 6 this ' eVenlng. Upon his perÂ»
son .was found a passbook |of the ; Hiberr
nla ; Bank of San Francisco ' showing $750
to hlÂ« credit. "'-' _
The history of Davalanne [ appears as
mysterious -as ~ : his death. Although :he
had stopped at the St. ' George for some
months, he seemed " to * have no "occupa
tion.- Yet he : was absent every night and
slept only, in the day. Some of the police
officers "have a theory .that; he; was .en

Railroad traffic officials report that the
effect of the crop outlook is perceptible
in the willingness of merchants in their
territories to place liberal orders for fu
ture consumption of their customers,
"causing an expansion In the freight
movement and a constant encroachment
on the available equipment at the dispo
sition of the railroads. The railroads are
placing liberal orders for supplies, and
the consequence is seen in the activity of
different departments of the. iron and
steel industry. A demand for steel rails,
plates and structural shapes is reported.
The cotton crop still gives ground for
anxiety, but the control effected by the
yellow fever situation has been a helpful
factor to the Southern railroads.
The bank etatement reflected only a
small part of the expected decrease in
cash reserves, . but the week's activity in
the stock market resulted in some.expan
sion of the loan account, co that the in
crease in the deposit item increased the
reserve requirement in proportion. The
net result was a shrinkage of about 53,
500,000 in the surplus of the banks.
The satisfaction felt in ' existing condi
tions of business and industry and the
general confidence felt in the promise for
future prosperity have resulted this week
in an appreciable growth In interest in
the stock market and an increase of or
ders to buy securities from various new
quarters. '
NEW YORK, Aug. ': 19.â The decided
dullness of to-day's stock market was
evidence of the spirit of caution devel
oped in the ] minds of operators by the
i reactionary tendency s developed yester
day. The hardening ; of." the rates for
money now seems imminent by reason of
the inception of . the- movement of I cur
rency on a large scale to the interior. The
abundance of the crops to 'be moved and
the very active conditions of business,
which are themselves instruments r of
prosperity, promise an extra requirement
on New York reserves. The ; extent of
this . requirement can only be measured
by its .actual development, and now that
the' demand has set in it is likely to pro
ceed steadily to the maximum. The rise
in the rates for call money, even .without
reaching the proportions of a stringent
market, has an almost inevitable effect
on borrowing for speculative purposes.
Holders of stocks on margin at the pres
ent high level of prices are naturally so
licitous therefore of the developments of
the immediate future.'":;?^.".: ,/V;

."The meaning, of these reductions to
the farmers of the Northwest is some
thing more than the-winning of a battle
or Hhe signing of some advantageous
commercial treaty," said a prominent
railroad official.. "It affects the entire
grain" product of the Northwest, for the
same rates have been met by the North
ern Pacific and must be met by every
other line doing business in the same
territory and tributary to it. You can
not > tell, how far a movement like this
will reach. It will mean a saving of
more than 200,000,000 bushels in the or
dinary markets. . This foots up from
$2,000,000 to 53,000,000 that will remain
in the pockets of the farmers, of which
the Great Northern will contribute at
least one-half."
ST. PAUL, Auff. 19.â Just aa the

Notice to Delegates to Christian Church
Conveution and Their Friends. :
The Board "of' Public Works does' not
expect ! any strike of the street sweepers
in:its employ, who are required to , work
on" Saturday afternoons, although the law
makes it a half-holiday. Commissioner
Eagan stated yesterday that there are
only thirty sweepers detailed for work on
Saturday afternoon, in order that the
streets in the downtown district may be
kept clean during the time when traffic
is on. The sweepers are to take turns. on
Saturday, afternoons, so that the j same
thirty will work' every six weeks on the
half-holiday. â¢ Eagan says the sweepers
have received many privileges and should
not object to helping the board out owing
to its financial" inabH|ty to hire additional
men or give double pay for,the half-holi
day; work. â¢\u25a0'.;â¢' Ifj^/j? ' "" 'I . â¢
"We do not expect any strike," said
Eagan, adding , slgniticanOy, "and Presi
dent Maestretti has given orders* that any
man- , who : refuses -to \ work â¢ on ' Saturday
sfternoon \ does . so under pain of dis
charge!"' \ â¢"
-Mr. Shaughnessy, in charge, of the
street sweeping work," said yesterday aft
ernoon that the street . sweepers were en
tirely \u0084v satisfied : and - everything; was pro
gressing : satisfactorily." The rgang de
tailed for. the afternoon, work had report
ed without a murmur, and Shaughnessy
said the ' report that a strike \u25a0Is imminent
was â¢ made ; for the â¢ purpose : of ' causing
trouble^ and demoralizing 'r the work" of
street sweeping," which'is being well done
at present. ''"\u25a0'â¢'-)'.'\u25a0â¢"'. , ...

The sales of real estate during the

more than ordinary importance, but the
total is not as large as for some weeks
preceding. The market Is strong and
steady and Is based on the certainty
that San Francisco has several years
cf prosperity Immediately in sight, ir
respective of any outside causes.
.. TJie reasons for this confidence are
found in the construction of the West
ern Pacific Railroad, which will cause
the expenditure of millions of dollars
in thiÂ« part of the State: the expendi
ture of millions to be derived from the
â¢ale of the city's bonds and the general
prosperity of the State and the steady
natural growth of San Francisco and
Its surroundings. These considerations
are all strong. Together they insure
the future of San Francisco from the
real estate point of view very thor
oughly.

TELEGRAPHERS'
STRIKE ENDED
NEW YORK, Aug. 19.â "Big Tim" Sul
livan, a noted political character of the
Bowery district, one of Tammany's bosses
and a Representative .in Congress, has
returned from Europe and gives his Im
pressions of London, of King Edward
and of Richard Croker. He said to-night:
"When a man wants to. take his family
out of London for a little holiday It costs
him 62 cents for each member. A ride in
the "tuppenny tube" costs 4 cents for
four miles. Over here you can ride in
the subway, which is better and cleaner,
and for 5 cents go fourteen miles and
more. And such cars as they have in the
"tuppenny"! The floorÃ are covered with
sawdust. Just like a stable. Over here we
would not put horses in such cars." .
Concerning the King of England, whom
he had seen twice, "Big Jim" had only
complimentary things to say. <
"He Is a democratic sort of chap," he
said, "and you'd never take him for a
King Just to see him. walking around the
racetrack, dressed In a stylish gray sack
suit. He is always smoking, and he tilts
his cigar at the same angle General Grant
did. I didn't speak to him, but I liked his
democratic manner. ,
"Another thing . I noticed about him
was that he was absolutely unguarded,
and, there was mighty little bending of
the knee or court manners paid to him
while he was at the track."
Representative Sullivan says he had
several hours' talk with Richard Croker.
"I found Mr. Croker very subdued and
little like the old Croker I knew," he
said. "The deaths of his two sons have
fallen heavily upon the chief, and he
plainly bears evidences of the trouble and
grief he has tried to bear bravely. All
the old-time fire and vigor, that I remem
ber bo well when he was our leader, has
gone. The old flash of his eye, that
meant fight, has gone. He is a subdued
and sorrowing man. I do not think he
will ever visit this country again.".

Hamilton became mixed up In the maze
of ropes and wires and for a few seconds
the spectators thought he had lost con
trol. But he soon had the upper hand,
and after going through several other
evolutions he sailed to the ground. The
machine descended gracefully and landed
in the meadows. Just before landing the
machine tilted and struck the ground on
one end, but was not damaged.
The second flight was made at 6
o'clock and' was! even .more ' ; successful
than the first. Hamilton did not Bhift
his position from the time he left the
ground and during the ten minutes he
was In the air the machine was about
fifteen feet from the ground.
The first flight, made at 4 o'clock, was
witnessed by several thousand , persons.
It was accomplished with the aid of an
eighty-horsepower automobile, operated
by Henry Mclntyre of the Brooklyn In
stitute of Arts and Sciences, who Is much
Interested in aerial navigation. A rope
was attached to the machine so that It
could not sail off over the ocean if Ham
ilton should lose control.
The aeroplane, constructed of bamboo
rods and light wire, spread Its wings and
sailed up at an angle of about 65 degrees.
The rope reached to the ground was not
taut and Mclntyre followed the airship
in his machine. When It was about 100
feet In the air the^machlne started in a
bee line, then made a circle and finally
zigzagged back and forth for several
minutes.

repeated disappointing failures during

by Charles Hamilton, who was aboard the
machine, It performed many evolutions.

Mrs. Young's mother In Winona, Minn.
Soon after that Mrs. Young began to act
strangely, and he became convinced that
her mind was affected. He had consulted,
physicians, he said, and had considered
the Question of Instituting proceedings to
have her sanity determined. Young said
that he had no doubt that his wife was
laboring under some hallucination when
she shot Mrs. Morgan.
Mrs. Young was taken ill to-night
and was removed to the prison ward in
Bellevue Hospital. There she was visited
by her husband and his brother, who said
that she would 'doubtless be able to ap

employs several stenographers In New

wounded Mrs. Catherine Morgan In a

Jealousy is believed to have been the
cause of the shooting. Mrs. Young and
her husband had separated and she be

Young made a statement to-night In
which he said he had employed Mrs. Mor

he said, came East with him a year ago.

YES, right now, if you want to save money and
time.
You save money because many of the pianos
arc reduced from regular prices as much as $100.
You save time because the reduction of $100
means 16 payments are practically made on the
piano the minute you pay $6 and have the instru-
ment delivered.
These pianos arc sold for $6 down and' $6 a
month. You can plainly sec that 1 6 monthly pay-
ments equal $96. The piano is reduced $100 â so
you get 16 payments free.
Buy that piano right now at this sale and it's
paid for a year and one-third quicker than if you
bought it at a regular price.
Every instrument guaranteed- â and the Kohler
& Chase guarantee means absolute protection now
and for years to come.

REDDING, Aug. 19.â Two men attempt
ed this morning at 4 o'clock to carry
out an apparently carefully laid plan to
rob the Southern Ptctflc depot at Ken
nett. Air that prevented the crime was
the watchfulness of Deputy Constable
Frank Llttlefield.' He saw the men- loit
ering around Â£the. depot and, took up a
position where he could watch thera.^ The
night operator was at his': desk with hi 3
head on his arms, apparently asleep. One
robber stationed himself- outside the de
pot near a window and the 'other sprung
the lock and went inside. He was stealth
ily creeping upon the operator when Llt
tlefleld put In an appearance. . The robber
outside gave 'a shrill whistle, his "pal"
sprang through the window ! and . both
ran toward the river.
Littlefleld fired two shots at them. At
the second . shot v one *of .the robbers
dropped, but he was " assisted to his feet
by his comrade and both escaped in the
brush. . ; ' -.

Binscham district, an oblong area of about
twenty-four square mile*.
The present output consists almost entirely
of low-grada pyrttous copper ore with compara

SPOILS PLANS
OF TWO THUGS
a two-edged sword. We of California â
and If any State in the union knows
what Chinese coolie labor means Cali
fornia ought to know â we of Cali
fornia protest against the great
Trans-Mississippi Commercial Congress
adopting this resolution. Let the ques
tion come before the congress in the
proper manner. 'Do we favor the ex
clusion of Chinese or do we not?" Let
the delegates vote on that." Â» .
A motion by Raker to table the reso
lution was followed by a long wrangle
over parliamentary law between those
who wanted to speak in favor of the
motion arid, those favoring! the resolu
tion. Chairman Fleming endeavored to
restore harmony, by suggesting that r a*
mountain, was being ' made out of a
mole bill, and that the gentlemen op
posing the resolution and supporting
the motion to table- It were injecting
demagogisra Into the proceedings.
This failed to -have -quite the desired
effect, for Judge Raker was on his feet
instantly to register a* protest at what
he termed the unparliamentary lan
guage of Chairman- Fleming. The mo
tion was finally put to a vote and de
feated.
The Californians were yet unwilling
to acknowledge defeat, and Judge
Raker appealed from the decision of
the chair, charging that many others
than delegates had voted on hla motion ;
and caused Its defeat. In this he was
vigorously supported by .Frank H.
Gould of California.
i>ebatc again grew acrimonious and
pandemonium again resumed sway
when In a flash it was ended by Sena
tor E. F. Harris of Texas, who pro
posed to Raker that If the appeal was
withdrawn he would move a recon- j
sideration. Judge Raker accepted the
olive branch and the motion to recon
sider was voted on by States. It failed
to carry by the overwhelming vote of
204 against 43 in its favor. The con
gress unanimously selected Kansas
City, Mo., aa the next meeting place
and chose the officers recommended by
the permanent organization committee.
At a meeting of the executive com
mittee it was resolved to recommend
the re-enactment by Congress of the law
which formerly allowed Pacific Coast
builders of naval vessels a differential
rate sufficient to enable them to com
pete on equal terms with builders locat
ed upon the Atlantic Coast.
At to-night's session of the Trans-
Misslsslppi Congress a paper was read by
John H. Hibbs, who delivered an address
on "Differentials."
One of the most Important resolutions
adopted by the congress was that touch-
Ing on interstate commerce, as follows:
"We. Insist upon the rigid ; enforcement
of existing laws as the proper remedy
for the unmixed evil of rebates, discrim
ination in freight and express rates and
special privileges to private car lines by 1
raliicads."
BICYCLIST IVAXTS DAMAGES r; .
FROM MAX WHO RAN HER DOW.V
SAN JOSE, Aug. 19.â Julia E. Scan
lan to-day began suit In the Superior
Court against C. A.' Braun forss33S 50
damages. On the evening of July SI;
1905, the plaintiff alleges, while riding
her bicycle along Stpckton. avenue,
Braun. who was driving in an opposite
direction, ran into her.- She alleges
that her escape from death was a mir
acle.
"Framed to remove^rÂ«njore," he
shouted. "That means nothing. Let
me tell you, vre are treading on dan
gerous ground; we are playing with

PORTLAICD,.Aus. 19.â Pandemonium
tor mlnutea at a time characterized to
day's stormy session of the Trans-
MisstsElppl Congress, which concluded
â¢to-day Its sixteenth annual session.
The discord occurred over the passage
of a compromise resolution on the sub
ject of Chinese Immigration. The reso
lution was adopted by the congress, but
only after Â«very step had been bitterly
contested by a portion of the California
delegation, headed by Judge John E.
Raker and Frank H. Gould, who wanted
the congress to take an emphatic stand
In favor of exclusion. The resolution,
while not speciflc. is g-enerally con
sidered favorable to the contentions of
those who advocate reconstruction of
the exclusion law so as to admit a cer
tain number of Chinese coolies in con
sideration of the abandonment of the
Chinese borcott.
The resolution which caused the dis
cord petitions the President of the
"United htates to. If deemed expedient,
reiterate the Instructions for proper
'treatment of the privileged classes of
China, to ascertain through the proper
channels the reasons for the present
boycott and to appoint' a commission
to investigate and to report to Con
gress with recommendations for a com*
prehenaive immigration law, framed to
remove from the United States and our
insular possessions all undesirable per
sons from every country.
Chairman F. W. FlemingT of thÂ« reso
lutions committee had scarcely fin
ished reading the resolution when
Judgre John E. Baker of* Calif ornia was
on bis feet.

paralysis began that way. I tried many medi-

According to the complainant's testi
mony. Mr. Wilkie Is an electrician and a
resident of Oakland, and while engaged
in 'altercation over a money transaction
with ' the doctor in the tatter's office he
abruptly drew the large pistol from one
of his hip pockets and brandished it in
such a fearsome way that not only the
doctor, but his young lady stenographer
and several patients awaiting consulta
tion, fled in terror.
Mr. Wilkie displayed to the couft a per
mit to carry a pistol â¢ and alleged that
the document, had been issued to him by
the authorities of Oakland. When . re
minded by the Judge that San Francsico
Is not within Alameda County's limits
and is not bound "by Oakland's official
acts Mr. Wilkie etevated his eyebrows
and 'said that was strange, as his license
to pack a gun had been honored by tha
\u25a0 police of every town in which he had oc
casion to show it, inclusive of the town
of Ogden, Utah, notoriously stringent in
the matter of law enforcement.

â¢ BOARD OF PUBLIC WORKS.
. We. further find that the Board -of
Public Works has never required the
official approval of bonds for the faith
ful performance of any contract, no
matter what the amount involved, by
indorsement upon the bond, by resolu
tions, or -by affirmative vote spread
upon the minutes. It was undoubtedly
the intent of the f ramers of the munici
pal charter that j every precaution
should be taken to protect the city In
the execution and enforcement of pub
lic contracts, and It is unquestionably
the fact that the provisions of the
organic law designed to give force and
effect to that intent have been utterly
! disregarded.
The gross misconduct and general
j neglect of duty of Morris Levy, secre
] tary of the Board o,f Public Works, now
i upon leave of absence from his official
I duties for a period of six "months from
! April 1, 1905, has been made subject to
investigation by this Grand Jury. This
leave was granted after several Irregu
larities In his'conduct had been called
to the attention of the board.
This Grand Jury believes that the
municipal charter places too much
j power in the hands of the members of
the Board of Public "Works and recom
{ mends revision.
j We are convinced that the various
1 departments of the Board of Public
Works should be materially improved
in efficiency by the introduction of. a
little system in the management of
public business.
We recommend that the departments
be 'reorganized, some of the sub-de
partments merged. Office space should
be condensed and the salaries of heads
of departments and employes should be
revised so that the 'compensation shall
be commemsurate with the service ren
dered that one may not receive greater
compensation than another performing
the came class of service where re
sponsibilites are equal.
We recommend for the Finance Com
mittee of the -Board -of Supervisors a
revision of the schedule .of fees col
lected in the different departments,
especially in that of the building per
mit department. 'â¢ â¢, : - %
We recommend that the three mem
bers of the Board of Public Works
whose appointment lies with the. Mayor
be selected hereafter for. their technical
skill 5 rather than because of political'
favors rendered. â¢
TAX COLLECTOR'S OFFICE.
In April, 1905, E.J. Smith, the Tax Col T
lector, defaulted, leaving ' a ' shortage
amounting .to ' $51,672 88, to which .should
be added $15,590.08, the 'amount of a per
sonal check 'cashed j by , Deputy | Treasurer
Devoto.; It is the opinion, of this Grand
Jury that the amount mentioned does not
cover the entire shortage and that a thor
ough . audit of " the/ accounts will disclose
further defalcations. <â¢ Ithvas the desire of
this body 1 that such an audit should be
made, and to that end several consulta
tions were held, but it was decided that
the number of accountants necessary and
the time required^ rendered lit impossible
for the Grand Jury to undertake ..the
work. " \u25a0 '.\u25a0\u25a0''
\u25a0 We believe that^the Tax Collector's oorf r
flee could be. conducted efficiently with
less number of permanent employes. .; \u25a0
1 We recommend 'the use" of; adding ma
chines. We. believe that five should be in
stalled and that skilled - operators should
be selected to handle the . machines.-/ â¢By
their- use all the tabulations .'of the office
could be done as .correctly and: result in
a great saving of clerical expense. v . <\u25a0 . ',

Under the present system it is prac
tically impossible for the Tax Collector.to

recommend that for each employe acting

This Grand -Jury reports that the
Auditor's office has been properly con

Harry Baehr and William Wilkinson,
his chief deputy. .
While this Grand Jury has confidence
in the honesty, and integrity of Treas
urer. McDougald, and believes that he
has been guilty of , no intentional
wrongdoing, it must condemn the un
lawful .practices that have \ been- ; in
vogue in his office. It has* been the
custom 'to cash checks for ; individuals
In and about the City Hall and for ; of
ficials of the government, in direct con
travention of the law of the State and
the provisions of the municipal chart

Numerous accusations, both general and
specific in character, indicating neglect of
duty and official misconduct on the. part
of the Mayor. Eugene E. Schmltz, have
been - presented- to this Grand Jury, and
each have been investigated as thorough
ly'as possible in order that the facts
might be accurately determined and the
responsibility fairly fixed. Scores of wit
nesses have been called and examined
and hundreds of official records have been
produced and scrutinized.
The accusations presented may be prop
erly divided into two :. classesâ first,
neglect, of the general duty imposed by
the charter to exercise proper administra
tive supervision over the affairs of the
various departments of the municipal
government, and, secondly, personal mis
conduct in the' use or. abuse of the au
thority and functions of this office,
coupled with the neglect of specific duties
enjoined by law.
Summarizing the result of our Investi
gation of accusations of the second class,
we find that the Mayor has been guilty
of misconduct in office.

register accumulated cobwebs and then
the Sheriff came. Curtains with the cafe.
Jack .olcCormack. whom John L. touted
as the coming champ, went up against
Gus Ruhlin and thought he was kicked
by a sleepy mule. Manager Hall went
up against some all-around hard luck.
There seemed to be a hoodoo on the trio.
Thse who know say that the John L.
Company cleaned up quite a little out of
the vaudeville business, but when the trio
entered the ticket oiuce they showed all
the symptoms of brokenness. But John
L. seemed as philosophical as ever.
"H , nobody loves a fat man any
how.'*, he said. "I ain't worrying over
my creditors. I ain't worrying over any
thing. We Just made up our mind to
blow, and we're blowing. We picked up a
hoodoo here and we've got to lose it.
Tours truly, John L. Sullivan."
John L. Sullivan has flitted from town.
So have Manager Hall and Jack McCor
mack, sparring partner of the veteran
gladiator and erstwhile aspirant for the
shoes of Jeffries. The tale goes along the
line that there are creditors who will
weep. .:\u25a0./:. ; i?'?xc?ik

MARYSVILLE, Aug. 19.'â Two crowded
Oregon trains were in collision at Lomo,
a siding six miles above Marysville, early
this morning, and a serious accident was
narrowly averted. Trainmen on the south
bound-train claimed when they arrived
here a few minutes after the accident
that they had orders to meet "the north
bound train at Lomo, and that the north
bound train had orders to meet the other
train at. Live Oak, several miles* beyond
Lomo. ';.-:.

The Grand Jury filed its final report with Judge Lawlor
yesterday afternoon and was discharged. The document
contains over 45.000 words and comprises an exhaustive
report on every municipal office. The Mayor's office, the
Police Commissioners, the Board of Public Works and the
Police Department are severely criticized. After the report
had been adopted by the Grand Jury, John T. Sullivan wrote
a letter to Judge Lawlor dissenting with the report as far
as it concerned the Police Department, the City Architect
tnd the Mayor. The communication was ordered appended
to the report.
The fact that Judge I^awlor did not thank the jury caused
much comment It has been customary for prending Justices
when dismissing a Grand Jury to thank the members for
what they have done. Proceedings to Impanel the succeed
ing Grand Jury will be begun on Monday.
The grand jurors who went out of office yesterday are:
T. P. Andrews, foreman; E. J. Bowes. William V. Bryan,
At the time this Grand Jury waa
impaneled the fact that the whole Po
lice Department was involved In an
elaborate system of bribery and corrup
tion had obtained such notoriety that
a rigid- investigation of its operation
w.is deemed imperative, and unusual
activity has marked the work of the
loinnittee, assigned to that duty. r
Though the unabating encrgry of its
members hfcÃ been exerted for monthsâ
and its efforts' have bÂ»Â»ea- materially
augmented by the active assistance of
the whole Grand Jury â its task is still
far from completed.
The results, however, may be sum
niarizpd in the finding that wholesale
and v.idespread violation of law is open,
notorious and vagrant; that it meets
with the acquiescence of the Mayor; that
it receives the approval of the Police
Commissioners; that it Is aided, abet
ted and protected by police officials; and
we are convinced that if this condition
be the result of incompetency it Is of
such a conspicuous and distinguished
quality that it must have been studious
ly cultivated, patiently acquired and
amply compensated. We find that vice
mid crirae have been organized so sys
tematically and fostered with such vig
a^nt attention to detail that nothing
business acumen or political ex
pediency could suggest has been
neglected or omitted: and the operation
of the svptem is so perfect that speedy
\u25a0 detection and rstlft punishment over
take the vicious and criminal who can
not pay the price.
The nrst matter called to our at
tention was tho open and notorious
gambling in Chinatown, long continued
under the protection of the Police De
partment and with the knowledge of tha
Mayor; and though our Investigation
there produced more tangible result*
than other lines of Inquiry pursued, it
fairly Illustrates the general conditions
revealed in other fields of criminal
activity.
POOLROOMS ARE OPE.V.
Ab It is not the function of this
Grand Jury to police the city and coun
ty of San Francisco, and nineteen men
would hardly be an adequate force for
that purpose In any event, that work
was left to the 700 police, under the di
rection of the Mayor, the Board of Po
lice Commissioners and the Chief of Po
lice. As a result, nearly all of the pool
rooms In tho city are 'again operating
without interference. '>-i; 7~7 ~ i
We believe that Immunity from
arrest and prosecution la purchased, and
we are convinced that the Mayor, the
Police Commissioners and the Chief of
Police could absolutely eradicate this
evil if they were so disposed. The Po
lice Commissioners have threatened to
revoke the liconses of saloon-keepers
because poker playing was permitted In
cigar stores connected with their places
of business, and as the majority of pool-
Belling is done from cigar stores tho
'*ajne method of procedure could be ap
f!ied with success, even though . they
were unable to obtain honest and effi
cient service from patrolmen.
It has been impossible for. this Grand
Jury to make a thorough investigation
c each department of the Board of
Public Works, or an audit of accounts
In the departments that receive money
for public services performed. From
such inquiry as we have been-able to
make into the affairs of this depart-:
rnent, and upon the facts developed,' we
report: - . Â«*â¢â¢*'
That the organization of the, Board
of Public Works - the Mayor, is 'In
Â£ ->ss violation of the charter.'
That the board has violated the char
ter In letting contracts and In approv-.
Ing bonds of contractors.
That the board has consistently op
posed the operations of the civil ser7
vice law.
That the. board has fixed salaries of
employes without regard to service
rendered and solely for political ex
pediency. . " .
That the board has permitted and
â¢countenanced* frequent violations* of
law by subordinates.
That Secretary Morris Levy has col
lected, retained and failed to account
flkir public moneys and has been gullty
or general misconduct and neglect of
duty. \u0084
That Architect W. D. Shea has been
guilty of neglect of duty and gross vio
lation of law In approving the- con-
Walter B. Bundschu, H. J. Cordes, Andrew M. Davis, P. Fa
bian, R. Finking, George Ai Hare, Joseph B. Keenan, D. H.
Loshen, P. F. McCarthy, George A. Newhall, S. B. Pauson,
J-. Poreher, James B. Smith, John H. Speck, W. G. Stafford
and J. T. Sullivan. . -
Foreman Andrews^, turned over to Judge Lawlor a com
munication addressed to the foreman of the succeeding
Grand JuYy. The communication contains some unfinished
investigations.
The Grand Jury report includes resolutions thanking
District Attorney Byington, Expert Douglass Young and
Mrs. M. V. Collins for assistance rendered. Foreman An
drews is unanimously commended by his fellow jurors for
the work he has done.
. Foreman Andrews announced that he intended to leave
town immediately to take a month's vacation. His fellow
jurors parted with him with expressions of good will.
Following are extracts from the Grand Jury's report:

"Nnmereu accusations, both general and specific In character, Indicating ne
trlect of duty and official misconduct on the part of the Mayor, Ktirene E.
Schmlts, hare been presented to this Grand ! Jury, and each has been tnvestl
srated a* thoroughly as possible, In order that the facts mtffht be accu
rately determined and the re*ponalblllty fairly fixed. Scores of witnesses have
bÂ«en called and examined and hundreds of official records have been produced
and scrutinized. ,
"The accnsatlons presented may be properly divided into two classes. First,
neglect of the general duty Impowed by the charter to exercise proper admin
istrative supervision over the affairs of the various departments of the municipal
government; and, secondly, personal misconduct. ln the use or abuse of. the au
thority and functions of his office, coupled with the neglect of specific duties
enjoined by law."â Extract From Grand Jury Report.
NUMEROUS ACCUSATIONS AGAINST SCHMITL
"This ' Grand Jury , urgently recommends that the of every depart'

preceding; January 1, 1900, -be 'thoroughly audited*' and that a new syhtent of ac

AN EXPLANATION. .
I am an attorney more than 70 years old
and retired with no office and living alone
in a den. I resided for nearly twenty years
in Santa Rosa, In Sonoma' County, Cal., and
know the State like a book. When I came
to Oakland I sold a few pieces of country
property for my friends and the result Is
I have a- list of more than 200 ranches, large
and small, on my books for sale, in nearly
every county In the State. ; - If you want a
home in California, where winter never
chills, leaves never fade and roses- always
bloom, I have got it for you. I take none
but good places with good Improvements,
such aa I : would want were I buying a home..
They are all near good markets, f schools â¢ and
churches. I owned a farm near- Utlca, . New
York, for twenty-five years and grew small
fruits and other crops and 'â¢ made a success
of it I can - advise others better 1 for -the
experience I have had. 1 am getting ' nÂ«w
places on my list and if. you do not. find
what you want on thla list write me -for
others and I will suit you. Tell me where
you want to locate, what you ' want to \ do â
whether raise stock, keep a dairy . or raise
grain., vineyard, fruit ohickens or plgeoiw â
and I can send you direct to the place you
want IRA C. JENKS. 1209 Broadway,. Oak-

In ' regard 'â¢, to : the ; letters, Judge ; Eason
said ithat^ half the charges against Miner

writing almost any kind of a' letter to get
out of prison.' â¢; ' -

charges, and severely scored Miner,' For

/NEW YORK, Aug. 19.â Headquarters*
detectives continued to-day their efforts
to discover ; who manufactured : and sent
infernal machines to Jacob* S. Schiff, in
the ; offices of : Kuhn, Loeb^-& . Co.,
and to': the Guggenheim Sons Company
on Friday. No arrests were made,
and, so far as could be learned, no defi
nite clew was uncovered/ but ' the reports
of \u25a0 the detectives to - Acting Captain* Mc-
Cauley were of such a character as to
cause him to SDeak of . the affair In a'
serious way to-night.
, Captain McCauley. said it" was his be
lief that the boxes were built and mailed
by ' a crank, .whose motives were difficult
to understand.' He would not be sur
prised if other â¢ bombs came to light ' In
the financial ! district In a short time.
- In : the ;af ternoon two , men visited ; po
lice '' headQuarters and insisted that the
bombs were the work of nihilists and that
international action should be ' taken at
once; The police; spoke of these men as
"two somewhat excited persons" , and
were Inclined to regard their mission as
of no consequence." Whoever,, the ."ex
cited persons'* : were, they insisted that
New York was imperiled by Russian
nihilists and that the State Department,
Japan 1 and any. other power that mignt
be made serviceable should be called in
to carry on the . investigation.
â¢ Members .of the Guggenheim . company
smiled as they talked about the bomb
affair, and, like those in Kuhn/ Loeb &
Co.'s office, said that. mall packages
for a few days would be handled very
gently. Arthur. T. Russell, assistant
manager, said :
"It is quite likely-: that some: person
had lost, money in stock speculation and
imagines that our firm and Kuhn, Loeb
& Co. .were responsible .for, the change
in the market." â¢

Tbe latent mail reports from the East say:
"While Jobbers are inclind to eive more
atUÃtinn to tuture prunes. 1 litre is nothing
of a speculative nature in toe demand. Or
ders, though rairly numerous, are generally
jot lots of one or two carloads lor early October
shipment. The views of kuians on thÂ« coast
â¢re very firm aad the tendtney of prices la
strongly upward. The basis now generally de
manded is o' 5 c for tbe four sizes of Santa
Claras in bags f. o. b, coast, with some pack
Â«rs,quoting on a 4c f. Â«. b. bag basis. Occa
sional eaJes, however, are still being made
Â«a a shade less than the 3%c f. o. b. basis,
though the quantity available at anything un
der the last named basis is small and daily be
ooming smaller. A premium is etill demanded
Â©a 306 and 90s by all sellers. Offerings of
Oregon Italian prunes for tuiure delivery are
made on the f. o. b. coast basis of 2;Â« c for
&0-40E and 2%c<for 40-50s. out the quantity
available this year is very small. The strong
tone of the market for future peaches is main
talced, and brokers still complain of the dif
ficulty in retting pack-ers to quote. Buyers
show no disposition to take hold at such prices
as are named, maintaining that they are too
high for present consideration. Apricots are
offered somewhat more ireelj', though sellers
<So not eeem disposed to make concessions from
their former quotations based on 7c for choica
Royals f. o. b. coast. No new developments
in the California raisin situation were noted on
Saturday. Offerings were extremely light and
Drices very firm at tbe recent advance, but
buying interest was less pronounced than
earlier in the week. Currants remained firm,

EASTERN MARKETS.
The recort of G. N. Salisbury, Section Di
rector, United Btates Weather Bureau, for the
Washington Crop Bulletin, week ended August
14. is as follows: â¢
Another dry and warm week has been added
to tie long period of drought that has ccntln
ued practically unbroken lor thirty days. In
the western counties the weather wu only
moderately warm, but in the eastern counties
the week was hot throughout.
The warm weather was beneficial to corn,
tomatoes, melons and hope. Corn has seldom
done bo well as it has this season, particularly
sweet corn in the western counties. Hops have
made very satisfactory development; the burrs
are now of lair size and growing well. The
insect pests are under control. Melons are
being shipped in great quantity and of excel
lent quality from the Yaklma country. Early
potatoes have done well, but the dry weather
IT having a bad effect on the late crop. Root
crops, especially beets, are doing well. Gar
deas are suffering from lack of moisture, and
apples and prunes are dropping quite badly
from the effects of the heat.
Pastures, particularly on uplands. arÂ» be
oomlng very short and dry. A second crop of
olover has been cut In the western districts
and secured in good condition. Flax is ripe
and laJbeUtg. cut.
- The w*athÂ«r is all that could be desired for
the harvesting of grain. Winter wheat cutting
Is nearly completed, and considerable thresh
ing has been done, with very good yields both
ln~ quantity anfl quality. The cutting ' of
spring wheat is well along; probably three
ieurth* done, except in late localities, in come
of which it will lineer until the end of the
month. From present appearances the yield
will be a m<"dium onÂ«, of excellent quality,
the Tallin* off from the early expectations of
-an unusually large yield being due to the In
. jury from hot winds, which in some districts
anÂ» considerable. In other districts, however.
tftere was little or no injury. - and in s>uch
oeses the yield will .be heavy- \u25a0 The warm
\u25a0weather ripened oats rapidly. Cutting Is well
' aler-K.' except on the lowlands of Fkaplt Coun
ty, where it has only fairly begun. The crop
.premises to be a very good one. although not
' unusually heavy. * ' v

;\u25a0\u25a0â¢â¢- '.This . shows ' that there ' has been ,no let up
to \u25a0' the great * volume of ' Hay which has - been
poured into this market for the last few weeks.
The warehouses ' throughout the country ' are
being rapidly filled and. 'from the present out
look, all storage that Is available will be taken
up. This not only applies to public warehouses,
but also to all private barns that Hay can be
stored in., .>''.\u25a0\u25a0 â¢â Â«\u25a0Â« \u25a0 \u25a0\u25a0-.-\u25a0\u25a0, \u25a0 .. \u25a0 i- \u25a0: ,
"The early rain that we had last season has
taught . a lesson to many. ,It looks as ' though
the Hay* would be cleaned out of the fields this
year earlier, than usual. While prices on Hay
during this week ' have - not been ' lower,' yet
there Is an easier tendency* throughout th*
entire line. The cheaper varieties of Hay go
begging. and fancy lots are coming more freely
and have-not been selling as readily, although
prices are.not quotably lower. . Choice -Wheat

"Alfalfa Hay Is coming forward 'a â¢ little
more freely and, while the demand is not par

The" final match for "the Scottish
bowling, championship played on the
green at Golden Gate Park yesterday
was the closest and most exciting 'ever
'witnessed Iri this city. J. C. Moffatt'
champion in 1903, regained his title
after being led all the way by his-op
ponent, A. A. McVicar. The match was
won by a. single 'point,, the score being
21 to 20. The loser had a comfortable
lead almost to the very end and looked
a sure winner.
When the score, stood 19 to 14 In Mc-
Vicar's favor, he hardly looked to have
a chance. to lose. Moffatt, however, did
not despair and by some wonderfully
accurate bowling 'took the next 'four
ends, scoring -six McVicar
ended up the score at 20-20, each need
ing but* one point \u25a0to win. McVicar's
first, bowl rolled right to the jack, but
fell away. . It looked good for the,polnt,
but Moffatt proved equal to the oc
casion and put his bowl almost.along
side of the jack, giving him the point
and championship. Moffatt gave a
great exhibition of nerve and at the
finish outbowled - his clever opponent

fatt's wonderful finish:

without a run.
Bobby Keef e had his revenge for the
reception tendered 'him in the 'opening
round the last time he hooked; up I with
the Commuters. 'He allowed Van's men
just, two hits during the: nine, innings.

â¢CINCINNATI, Aug. .19â May Sutton,
the clever California girl I who recently
won the woman's tennis championship of
England, arrived in Cincinnati to-day
somewhat unexpectedly.' She will . par
ticipate in the tri-State tournament which
will open here in a few days:
lovers of tennis are looking forward ; to
great sport, as Miss Sutton will : play, in
doubles with Bcals Wright. . }.;
In discussing her .- experiences in .) Eng
land Miss Sutton said: "English women
are fine tennis players. You v see, English
women have been playing tennis for cen
turies. We are rather new at the game
yet in America. : Miss Blanche Hillary
and Miss s Wilson,', the English tennla
champions, whom I defeated at VVinibje
don, ,Â«are the best players in England.
Miss Hillary has- been | playing for about
fifteen years, but is not as good at the
game,;, however, aa Miss \ Wilson," the
younger of the two. ' \u25a0
"The English women are' athletic.
They wear white linen chokers, long
skirts, and their shirtwaist sleeves are
primly fastened about their wrists. N Miss
Hillary (would you believe it?) wears
white hid gloves on :the tennis court.
My short skirts - and â¢ rolled-up sleeves
made a rensa-tion.. The English .manner
of giving prizes, presentation to 'tfie

RESULTS OF GAMES.
â¢D.-H. Lewis, secretary of thÂ« Buf
falo Automobile Club and manager of
the present meeting, said that notwith
standing the statement made by for
mer-President Hotchkiss. races wouTd
be continued to-day.
"Barney Oldfleld has volunteered to
finish Jay's .races and," if he can win,
to turn over the prize money to the in
jured man. " Dr. Bbcby. one of the sur
geons attending Jay. said to-day -that
the injured man still has a flghtln*
chance for life.' Complications from
internal injuries were the greatest
source of danger, he said.
CLEVELAND. Aug. !Â».â Earl Klser.
the auaomoblle racer, who lies in a
hospital here recovering from an in
jury that cost him- Ms left leg. stated
to-day that he will give up racing. Th*
accident to Webb Jay at Buffalo made
a profound impression upon Klser and
led him to make this decision.

PITCHF.R OVERALL IS EASY
FOR THE BOSTON SLUGGERS
Many of the leading officials in au
tomobile racing, including manufactur
ers, are a unit in declaring that the
accident to Jay, ' following so; closely
on others of a similar character, has
sounded the death knell to automobile
racing on " circular tracks. William
Hotchkiss. former president of the
Buffalo Automobile Club, said: â¢", '
','There will never be another auto
mobile race in Buffalo or In its vicinity
if I can; enlist the power of the Su
preme Court of New York, to prevent
it. I shall hereafter oppose the hold
ing of anyfsuch events, both as a law
yer and as an enthusiastic automobl
list"
BUFFALO. Aug. 19. â Webb Jay. .who
was so terribly injured In the ten-mile
automobile race at Kenllworth "^.Park
yesterday, continued to Improve to-day.
While/ he ; Is not yet out of - dancer,
every hour of improvement will help
him to fight the crisis when It comes.
Pneumonia and pleurisy have not yet
set in. as was anticipated, and his
punctured lung is not so badly injured
as was thought. Jay was partially
conscious at times to-day, but ' he did
not recognize his wife and his little
boy at his bedside.

Manager Coftroth then announced
that so far as he waa concerned the in
cident was closed. His plans for the
promotion of the affair at Colma are
elaborate and be must set his men at
work to-morrow on the arena to have
It completed in due season. Thcio i*
another reason which is more import^
ant to him. He does not want the im
pression to go abroad that the fight
will be held on some date other thin
Admission day. He expects
from various parts of the United
States and he does not want them in
doubt as to whether there will be a
postponement of the fight.
At a meeting of the celebration commit
tee of the Native Sons last night, the
fight committee reported" that nothing
definite had been done ud to date, but
that they expected to delegate men to
the I various summer resorts where the
Supervisors are spending their vacations
to see if they could not secure their sig
natures to a petition for a fight permit
in this city for the Colma Club during
the month of September. The committee
stated it would be a useless task and a
waste of money to try to bring this end
about by the means of telegrams. They
Mated, however, that they could let the
dub manager know definitely by Wed
nesday whether they could secure the
permit.
MAVAGER COFFItpTH'S STA.\D.
From the stand taken by Manager Cof
froth last night it is a question as to
what action he would take if the permit
were placed in his hands within the next
three days. He stated positively that he
would not take the matter up again.
Efforts were made yesterday to bring
Manager Nolan and Will*? Britt together
on the question of the <10,000 side bet,
which played such a prominent part in
the negotiations for the match. Harry
Corbett. the official stakeholder, was at
Uncle Tom's Cabin and could not be
reached. 'lt was agreed to meet him to- '
morrow, when the bet may be made. The
pretsent intention is to put up $2500 on
oach side to guarantee the bet would be
completed on the day before the fight.
" BOXERS ARE IX TRAIXIXG.
Jimmy Britt settled down to the routine
of training yesterday by going on the
road for a long tramp. His boxing an<J
other work will be taken up next.week at
tin 3 Beach ' Tavern. . .- -
Battling Nelson was the center of at
traction at his training quarters at Smil
ing Melzner's yesterday. He greeted his
visitors pleasantly and chatted about his
hunting and fishing experiences in the
Sierra Nevadas and expressed himself as
feeling confident of winning the coming
fight. Nelson, who Is as brown as a
berry and as active as a cat from his
mountain trip, put in the day with road
work, horseback riding and skipping the
rope. The outdoor arena was completed
yesterday and Nelson will do his work
there. Nelson has been doing shadow
work on the platform and he will begin
sparring to-day with Jimmy Gardner.
Nelson managed to reduce his weight' by
two pounds to-day. He says that he will
have no trouble to get down to weight.
Unless something unforeseen hap
pens the fight between Jimmy Brltt a.nd
Battling Nelson will take place at
Colma on September 9, as originally
planned. The Native Sons were .not
able to deliver to Manager James Coff
roth last night a permit for a fight to
take place In this city some time in
(September subsequent to Admission
day. l . . -

WORSE THAN THE DISEASE
\u25a0'\u25a0 The effects of Mercury and Potash are
worse ' than ! the effects of ' Contagious
Blood Poison, for which these miaeralÂ»
are , generally used. They . cannot cure
the disease,' and in addition set up a pois-
on of their own, producing dyspepsia, by
drying tip the gastric jufces, salivation,
sores,- mercur'al rheumatism,- and of tea
necrosis of the bones.

fered greatly rrom a aÂ«Tere-caaa of Con-
tagious Blood Poison. I wont to Hot
\u25a0 Springs, stayinr there four month* at a
' big expense, j I then consulted * phyÂ«i-
! clans, who prescribed Mercury. : Noth-
ing did me any eood, in fact the treat-
ment proved more harmful than beaen-
. ciÂ»l- ' Thus I continued to suffer for foar
years. I mentioned my ease to a friend,
) who told me that 3. S. 8. had certainly
cured him. I at onoa commenced ita use,
and in six months could find no trace
of the disease whatever. This waa about
two' years ago, and there- hae been no
aiffss of return. D. M. SAJTOEBS.
S. S. S., a remedy made from roots,
herbs and barks, is the only known an-
tidote for Contagions Blood Poison.:/ ir
thoroughly and .permanently eradicates
the poison from the blood so that no sign
is -, ever seen 'of __ the disease in future.
\ S. S. S. builds up instead of tearing down
; the system, ; as do . Mercury . and Potash,
and when it has cured the â¢ disease every
part of. the body has been toned up
.by k its purifying and â¢ .tonic ; effects.
