Scenes of indescribable terror ensued.
Women aroused from their sleep, rushed
half-clothed into the streets screaming
â¢with fear, carrying their babies and drag
ging along other children, and calling for
help on the Madonna and the saints. The
men escaped into the open with their
families, all calling on their favorite
eaints for protection. The cafes were
taken by assault by the strangely garbed
crowd, tut as daylight broke the crowd
repetition of the earthquake the crowd
gradually melted away until by 8 o'clock
the streets had almost aEsumed their
normal appearance except in the ruined
villages, where the inhabitants had no
homes to go to. The general confusion
\u25a0was added to by dreadful cries from the
jails where the prisoners were beside
themselves with fright and in some cases
mutinied, but fortunately all the prison
ers were kept within bounds.
Troops, engineers and doctors have been
hurried to the scenes of disaster to assist
In the work of rescue and salvage. The

Mrs. William 'C Young 'will \u25a0 to-mbrro'w
leave New York.^State forever. . Magis
trate Steinert' has co Idecided. ; At. 10
o'clock to-morrow a" detective will call
for the woman and "noon she L will
be on her way to'the West. No complaint
was made in court against Mrs. Young,
for Mrs. , Morgan refused \u25a0 to, accuse her.
Mrs. .Young carried, herself lightly and
smiled to j several women ; friends when
she appeared to answer for the, shooting,
which took . place August ' 19 -in the Im
perial Hotel. '. - .' .
She was lunching. with her counsel when
Mrs. Morgan, who had arrived from the
hospital, entered from 'a side" door' and,
supported by two court attendants, weak
ly, climbed to the platform, facing the
Magistrate. . A .tain, gray" veil could not
hide the pallor of .ulrs. Morgan's face and
she leaned against a policeman as she
asked if she must make a complaint. At
that moment she. turned and for the first
time saw the woman . who had . shot her
when her back was turned. ' She gasped
and dropped . her j head in terror, j
"Oh, that woman, that woman," she
whispered, and she clung , to' the police
man and to' her "counsel as though: she
expected to be attacked. "I cannot make
a complaint against her," she half sob
bed. "She is insane." .
Magistrate Steinert . directed that Mrs.
Morgan be taken to his chambers. As
sistant District ' Attorney Kernochan said
Mrs. Morgan could not be â induced: to
make a complaint against Mrs. "Young and
added that he 'was. willing to adopt some
measure which would insure his office
against further \ annoyance by the de
fendant.
'Magistrate Steinert suggested that she
leave the State forever. Mrs. Young said
she would remain in jail , rather ' than be
compelled to leave the city. Â» Her friends
begged her to , reconsider her determina
tion,' but she . refused to listen to them
until the last minute. Then she capitu
lated and Magistrate Steinert discharged
her in custody, of her lawyers until to
morrow i when his decree goes into effect.
She and Mrs. Morgan refused to make
any statement.

Government officials and the better class
of Japanese citizens are expressing keen
regret over the attacks on Christtan
churches. They 'explain that the affair
was the result of local conditions and
does not indicate a serious anti-foreign
or anti-Christian feeling. They say that
there^ has been local feeling over the re
fusal^ of native Christians to contribute
to temple subscriptions, and their efforts
to secure the closing of business-houses
on Sunday. Many declare -that native
Salvationists, addressing a meeting in
I the Asakusa district, started the trou
ble by rebuking the crown for acts of'
violence.
FOREIGNERS ARE UXCOXCERXED.
! It was reported last night that a mob
I intended to attack the Catholic cathedral
lat Tsukljl, but no demonstration was

, â Foreigners in Toklo, generally, are un
concerned over the situation.
Preparations are progressing to present
claims to the Government for the foreign
j church property which has been de
stroyed.
i The members of the Harriman party
have gone to Nikko, , having canceled the
local programme for their entertainment.
The Incident of the attack on mem
bers of the Harriman party is not re
garded as a demonstration against
Americans or other foreigners, but la
believed to have largely been the're
sult of the time and circumstances.
There have been a few expressions of
regret that Japan consented to \u25a0' Presi
dent Roosevelt's proposal for a , peace
conference, but It is apparent that this
sentiment Is not general! held. Many
expressions of regret have been mad*
by all classes over the Harriman Inci
dent.

KEW YORK, Sept. B.â "America and

Siamese twins," eaid Sergius de Witte.
the Russian peace envoy, in an interview
published .to-day by the Herald. , â .'
"The two great countries of the world,"
he continued, "are Russia and the United
Elites, Â«re the two great countries
of the -world because they both produce

any, nation's success."
Aeked tf.be thought Russia's commer
cial position-had -been- bettterAd or injured
by thevar, De. Wltte replied:
"Ruesja" is better now â¢ than - she ever
was. Alter the war she will pet on her
feet again, and when she gets on her feet,
it will be a firm and -strong position that
ehe takes. We have the men. the money (
and the people. We have the greatest un
developed country that exists. Our cli
mate ranges^ from the tropic to the arctic.
"It isa very delightful thing to have a
country much like our own step in and i
act as the intermediary. I do not care to ;
speak about the trouble or the future re- \u25a0
suits. -That is. a matter which is entirely
dipTomatic ar.d . official, but I do. feel a
very gi eat kindness for tbe /American
people i outside of all official relations.
We came 'here as friends and were re
ceived as guests. We are still in that
deJightful-. condition." . , - â¢ - -
â¢â¢Ru*la,': sa.id the Â«nvoy in. discussing
the reports of internal troubles, "is a
much misunderstood country in America.
America is so far away, so remote In all
the possibilities of our national life, that
exaggerated reports become current here.
It also happens that we of Russia have
erroneous reports' about the United States.
We arc told of your lynchings, your riots,
your popular uprisings. In St.. Petersburg
and Moscow these appear to us very se
lious matters. Doubtless _we appear to
your statesmen here in the' same position.
Still. 1 think it 1Â« only fair to look at
the two troubles in social economics with
an eyeglass "which reaches 5000 miles.
"I "cf rtainly do not Intent* to state that

v" PORTLAND,- Sept. B.â Captain David A.
Dare,. master of the .United States trans
port Foote during the. Civil War,. died at
the County Hospital â¢ yesterday evening
at the age of 73 years, on the eve of what
promised to^be a great battle to- recover
pVo'peirtyVvat Dallas, Texas, worth "hun
dreds ;of. thousands. of Vdollars;iof which
ho claimed he was the rightful, owner.

as .'possible. '. " , ;:'\u25a0 '
Captain Dare's history reads like a ro
mance. Bigamy plays a', prominent part
in the drama, and it is owing to this that
Captain Dare was separated from his pos
sessions. .Disease partly clouded his mind
so that for years he did not recover the
use of faculties sufficiently to try to-re
cover what he stoutly maintained on
the bed of death belonged to him. Some
time aeo Mrs. -Joseph Brandon of Wood
lawn became '; aware ; that .Captain Dare
was at the poor farm, a ward of y the
county. She visited, him several times
and discovering:, that" he had left Dallas
without disposing of his landed Interests
she became keenlyjnterested in his case
and induced him to give ; rfvr a deed Ito
the property which he "said was his.
She then took the matter, up with a
lawyer, who has written to Dallas to se
cure additional Information. Mrs. Bran
don worked for Captain, Dare at Dallas,
and , says that though he died a â¢ pauper,
he was in reality- a wealthy man. He has
relatives living in the East. It is said
he was not in : full possession of his fac
ulties when he; died.

WASHINGTON. Sept. B.â Miat the pur
pose of the Federal Government is to use
the resources ' of . its \ forest reserves for
the- benefit of the country and people just
as far as is consistent with the perma
nence, and improvement, of the forest is
well Illustrated by the plans now being
made by the forest service to sell mature
timber wherever there is a legitimate de
mand. "A thorough investigation of the
reserves in California is under way to lo
cate the principal bodies of timber - which
are \u25a0 ripe for cutting and which can be
logged without injury to the forest.
As rapidly as practicable, maps and es
timates will bo made, and plans will be
prepared : f or cutjlng the mature trees
under methods ' which will improve and
perpetuate the forest- rather than de
stroys it. .
The essential features of such meth
ods of logging include leaving and pro
tecting the ' small ; growth, usually in
this region all trees under twenty or
twenty-four inches in diameter, and re
serving a fourth or a fifth of the large,
full-bearing trees of .the most valuable
species/like the sugar pine of the
Western ; Sierras, to furnish seed. ,Th*
watersheds : of . streams -which' are im
portant* for irrigation or water ' power
should ; be lightly logged, so as . not to
impair the value of the forest as a nat- .
Ural reservoir;^ The tops and slash left
by . the lumbermen \u25a0 are carefully piled
and burned to lessen the danger of de
structive fires and to expose the soil for
seed germination. Under such- methods
a new* and ~ r usually " a denser ) and ; more
valuable forest growth is secured after
logging, and a second cut of timber can
be. made within a comparatively short
time.': v: " : : \u25a0'â¢I' \" .-"--. -::\u25a0â¢'. "" .\ '" '-\u25a0

Figure in Transactions
That Involve Millions
NEW YORK. Sept. B.â To-day's session
of the life insurance investigation waa
devoted exclusively to the affairs of the
New York Life Insurance Company, and
a searching examination was made of its
officers who appeared on the stand. Be
ginning with the salaries paid to the of
ficers, the line of inquiry extended through
â¢all the details of the company's participa
tion in various underwriting: syndicate*
for railroad securities, the New York's
Life's .connection with . trust companies
and, finally, near the close of the day",
developing the fact that it was not an'
unusual thing for clerks or messengers in
the employ of the company, with salaries
as low as $500 a year, to sigm notes for
millions of dollars to be used by the com
pany in relieving its books of undesirable
securities. . . ' . : .
An interesting feature of. the day was
the statement that Thomas W. Lawson of
Boston might be called as a witness. The
committee's chairman. State Senator
Armstrong, eaid if the information Law
son is supposed to hold could not be se
cured from, any. other source the Boston
financier would be asked to testify. Not
being a resident of the State Lawson can
not be compelled to give testimony.
Officers of the New York. Life Company
testified to-day that on cne occasion it
became necessary for the company to sell
certain securities in order to satisfy, the
Prussian Government. . Two clerks signed
notes aggregating $2,333,000 and on the.
books the securities appeared as sold to
these parties, . although they really had.
been 'turned over to the New York Trust
Company as security for the loan made
on the notes of the two insurance com
pany , employes. It was declared that
since 1599 the New York Life Insurance
Company had not been connected with
trust companies, but subsequently it waa
admitted that the stock of the New York
Trust Company is now held for the New
York Life by a committee of trustees.
The New York Trust Company i 3 a con
nection of % the New York Security and
Trust Company. and the Continental Trust
Company.
The committee adjourned this afternoon
until 10:30 o'clock next Tuesday morning.

The days of the parlor are fast going.
There was once a time when every
i family, no matter how poor, had it 3
i parlor. And generally the parlor yra.s
almost useless place, but It was "the
pride of the housewife. The Observant
Citizen remembers some time \u25a0 ago
when the lady of the house insisted
that he should see "her parlor.** Her
husband smiled good-naturedly, and
they both led thet way to a big front
room which was. locked. The door waa
unlocked and the parlor got its first
fresh air. in months. The little family
'had expended much money on the par
lor. tEvervthing- was new buf the
stuffed birds under glass cases." TnÂ«
design of the carpet was jvonderful !n
that it consisted of bright red roses.
One felt like stepping into a bed of
flames.;' A horseshoe sofa. -very erect,
was the principal article of furniture,
while"" at the windows were the stiff est

had a musty smell due to lons con
fined air. It was "luxury imprisoned".

SHORT NOTICE
BY ROOASEVELT
Public Printer Removed
for Disobedience
of Orders.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
OYSTER BAY. N\ V.. Sept. B.â Mo*2d
to anger by the disobedience of his or
ders by F. W. Palmer, Public Printer at
Washington, President Roosevelt to-day
summarily removed ' Palmer from office
seven days before the allotted time.
Palmer's disobedience consisted in try
ing to oust Ricketts and Hay, foremen in
the printing bureau, who had testified
against him at the recent investigation
of the Keep commission. After the in
vestigation had been concluded Palmer
asked for Ricketts' and Hay's resigna
tions. When they refused to resign they
were directed to appear before the Public
Printer on September 5 and show cause
why they should not be* removed. On Sep
tember 6 Palmer received an order from
the President calling . for his resignation
on September 15 and directing him to is
sue no further orders to his subordinates
and forbidding him to Interfere with their
work.
Despite this the President heard to-day
that Palmer had ordered Ricketts and
Hay to" appear before him to-morrow to
answer the charges he was to have pre
ferred last Tuesday. Thoroughly indig
nant. President Roosevelt instantly re
moved Palmer from office.
WASHINGTON, Sept. B.â President
Roosevelt's action in summarily re
moving Frank W. Palmer, Public
Printer, and placing Oscar Ricketts
temporarily In charge, is regarded here
as the startling culmination to quarrels
that have disturbed the Government
Printing Office during the investigation
by the Keep Commission. It is expect
ed her* that the temporary appointment
of Ricketts moans that he will event
ually be Public Printer â a place for
which he was slated last spring. It haÂ«s
been evident lor a long time that
Palmer has been unable to enforce
discipline In bis office, and in the re
cent investigation growing out of the
scandal of the typesetting machines it
was made clear that the office was
torn up with cliques and factions. All
of the manufacturers of printing ma
chinery have their representatives scat
tered throughout the office to look after
their interests. The, great establish
ment," which is expending now $7,000,000
a year.' has. under Palmer's manage
ment, generated into a lot of nearly in
dependent divisions, each of which has
been squanderlng # public money and
overloading the payrolls. It is believed
tnat the overhauling which" the dis
closures already made make necessary
will show a scandalous condition of
affairs.

WASHINGTON, Sept. B.â The board of
consulting engineers of the Panama canal
met to-day. The discussion 'related to the
size of the locks and of the canal itself.
The* complete conclusion 'reached by the
board as the result 'o* the three hours'
conference was that |the location of the
canal as marked on the official maps ' of
the commission known as the French lo
cation shall be accepted as a. basis for
the detailed discussion of .its' structure
which is to follow. This action was taken
formally by a vote cf the board, v.
The questions of the. type of canal
to be built, its depth, width and. height,
and the number of locks to be used, were
all touched on during the meeting, but
no conclusion was reached.. However, the
question as to whether a sea-level canal
shall be recommended has not been taken

An interesting feature , of. the session
to-day was the presentation of. an ex
tensive paper on the size of ships, by M.
Girard, the French engineer. The con
j elusion reached by M. Girard is that' the
size of ships is constantly increasing.:
This fact was given its proper bearing on,
the necessity, for. deeper harbors and
larger waterways. The paper was pre
sented in French, but will be \u25a0\u25a0 translated
and made a part of the records of the
board.
Every member of the board was present
and- the discussion -was 'participated in
by all in a most interesting manner.y
It is the .purpose of the. board: to 'meet
to-morrow and continue discussion daily.;
The board reconvened at 3 o'clock. The
discussion first touched upon' the size, of
the berm and of the slope of the canal,
but no decision was reached, as the memf
bf rs did ' not feel "able jto decide .without'
first having_ seen the: natural, aspects of

Mrs. Ray Partin'gton. a saleswoman
employed : by, Hale â¢ Bros., "was found
dead from asphyxiation in her room at
625 \i La rk:n . street : about 9 o'clock | last
night.. Surrounding circumstances, point
strongly to "suicide, although no motive
can be found for the deed. She was 22
years of age, apparently in good health
and erlven to a ouiet life. -\u25a0' -\u25a0\u25a0'\u25a0' - ; V\,
Mrs. Partington was last seen on Thurs

the Alcazar-Theater with a man named
Joseph 'Simpson, ;"a musician at a Powell
street theater, and M!ss Sarah ' Raphael
of 978: Post .street, also an \u25a0 employe -of
Hales. Yesterday; morning Miss Ra
phael knocked at the door of Mrs. Part
ington's 1 room, -intending, to^ accompany
her to .work, < but receiving? no answer
she naturally' supposed that her friend
had already 'gone.- :~.
About -9 o'clpck .", last revening . IÂ«ouis
Smith, a" son of the .landlady who con
ducts the lodging-house. \u25a0 noticed an odor
of gas near the room of Mrs." Partington
Convinced that something was wrong, he
burst open the door. The fumes' of .gas
were so. strong that he was forced' to re
treat, but there, lying on the bed \u25a0 clad
only in her night' dress, was the body of
the unfortunate woman." Smith hastily
summoned Patrolman Roedlger and; tho
two. succeeded in removing â¢; hte body,"
which -was taken to the . Morgue.
I\o letters or anything to denote that
the woman - contemplated > the act \u25a0 were
found in the roonv-yet the police and the
inmates of the; house, say that accidental
death was impossible, as Mn. Partington
was- familiar with the lighting system.
Simpson is grief-stricken over the/af
fair. He was engaged to marry the young
woman: He does riot believe* that It was
suicide. "I'cari see no reason for the act,'!,
he said last night at the Morgue, "for she
??ad everything to be happy for. When 1
left her Thursday night she was in a
happy frame of mind. I never dreamed
of this. It must have been an accident."

"she is being tried o'nth'e^charge of fraudu
lent "card writing."
At a very Â» dramatic stage ~of the pro
ceedings, the accused medium is reported
to have demanded a public test, at which,
if. necessary; she will .permit herself ..to
be disrobed. She is willing to suffer
humiliation of "a sort; which is . repellant
to feminine nature in order -to vindicate
her own reputation arid that of the spirit
ualistic cult which is regarded by its fol
lowers as a religion. She is willing to
give one of her "card writing", demonstra
tions in a large downtown hall or in one
of. the theaters,^the doors of which are
to be thrown open so that all who.so.de
sire may attend. She insists that her
seance, be given under absolute test con
ditions.
The conditions specify that , she shall
be completely disrobed In the presence
of a committee of disinterested persons
before ! she I goes j upon tne stage. This is
to prevent the possibility of her having
chemicals or apparatus concealed about
her, clothing. Women mediums have fre

terribly despondent - to-night. ; He * had

MASTER OF SITUATION.
Conviction of Trio of Boodlera Rests
; With Go-Between.
SACRAMENTO, Sept. B.â lf Joseph S.
Jordan returns from Tonopah, Nev., to
aid the State in its efforts to send to
prison the Doodling Senators that re
main to be tried, ' Eli Wright, Frank
French and E. J. Emmons, it will evi
dence the fact that he has changed. his
mind. " When' he left California it was
in flight to escape the ordeal of bear
ing further witness against the men
that were, associated with him in tne
crime for which Harry Bunkers stands
convicted and ' sentenced "to * serve five
years in \Jhe penitentiary.
The facts .as? above outlined were
positively proven to-day and go , far to
establish the theory advanced that Dis
trict -Attorney .Seymour's "struggle of
weeks to secure a confession from
Bunkers was to' supply an absolutely
necessary link in the chain of*evidence
that had been lost through the exces
sive confidence of Seymour that Jordan
was a man of his word and would re
turn without question or delay the mo
ment the word . was given- him. But
these are the facts:
The day that Jordan decided to leave
California he called upon one of , his
closest Sacramento friends and said:
\u25a0 - .' r. \u25a0 \u25a0 â¢ .â¢-\u25a0â¢.:
I have 'decided to leave- the State, not to re
turn-until after the cased against all of the
accused Senators with whom I was associated
have been disposed of. No man knows how it
galled me to testify, against Bunkers, but I
was forced into a' position where it was aby>
lutely necessary that I unould : do so , to s:l^e
myself.' I never would have testified against
them before the Senate but for the belief that
the four accused Senators had conspired to make
me . the scapegoat." â¢ However, I am going to
leave â¢ the State. The three charges that were
laid against me when the storm broke in the
Senate have been dismissed and my bondsmen
released. There ;!s ' nothing to hold me here
now and I am going to escape, if possible, the
ordeal of again testifying in. the: case.
Should I once;t>t across the border there Is
no way that 1 1 can \'i brought back. No doubt
an I effort | will be \ made to I extradite j ryy" but
It windfall." The only extradlta)>.e - o.^ense I
ever committed was this one, v and as I am im
mune under the. law from punishment for It
they cannot "bring me tack for this. "There 1*
only one thing,. that remains \u25a0 for them to do
and that -is to Indict me oon a . false charge.
Governor ' Pardee Is ; too . smart : for this game
to -be - played, T, however. .' I do not I think Ihe
would - ; * Interest - himself against' me unless
everything Is straight and. legal. Consequently
I believe = that' if once over : the border I will
be safe ~ against - any â¢ process that may l*e
served Â» asalr.st ; me, â¢ and I twill: not givt^my
deposition, ; either. \lf ( I [am not greatly mis
taken,-!, have made my exit from the case of
the people against the boodllng Senators.^ .
This is the last statement Jordan made
to' any one regarding his feelings in ref
erence to the boodle case. He has " the
situation well studied; out arid isnow its
master.' It all rests with him. \lf he does
not return it is the general â¢ opinion that
District Attorney /Seymour will be unable
to mend the broken , chain of evidence,
and that the boodlers wlllwin their-, fight
for: liberty. - ' , ft -

Charles Burrows ot Rutherford, N. J.,
and Charles G. Nturton of Nevada, Mo.,
were placed in nomination. Burrows'
name was withdrawn. The call of the
roll of departments proceeded until it
became apparent from the number of
names seconding- Tanner that his selec
tion was a certainty. Although George
Stone ot" fran Francisco was not named
formally as a candidate, the Depart
ment of California and Nevada cast
their fifteen votes for him. The total
vote for Tanner was 447. Brown re
ceived IST, Ohio and Pennsylvania giv
ing him their full vote and Indiana a
majority. The only large delegation
that voted for Burton was thot of
Missouri. His total strength was forty
two votes. When the adjutant general
announced the result the convention
went wild. The old veterans leaped
from their seats, shouting and cheering
and throwing their hats into the air.
Amid the din General Brown mounted
the stage and when quiet had been
restored sufficiently for him to be heard
he moved to make Tanner's election
unanimous. Messrs. Burton and Stone
both seconded the motion, which was
carried with a roar of ayes. Com
mander In Chief King appointed the de
feated comrades a committee to escort
Corporal Tanner to the stage. While
the four t^ere walking down the center
aisle the delegates made a rush for
Tanner, and. lifting him Into the air,
carried him bodily to the rostrum.
The delegates then rose en masse and
cheered for several mrnutes.
THA.VKS HIS COMRADES.
In a brief speech Corporal Tanner
thanked his comrades.
"There is one man," he said, "whose
esteem and assistance It is necessary
for thÂ« old soldiers to have. There are
three men In the encampment whom I
will call in council in meeting Presi
dent Roosevelt."
Another great shout went up as Cor
poral Tanner indicated the persons he
referred to in his veiled remark, and
as it died down he said that he ex
pected to have the beneficent counsel
in all his undertakings ascommander
in chief of Senator William Warner of
Missouri, General John C Black of Chi
cago and Granville M. Dodge of New
York.
The convention proceeded to ballot
ing for officers at the conclusion of
Tanner's address. George W. Cook of
Denver was the only nominee for senior
vice commander and received an ova
tion when his election was announced.
For junior vice commander James G
Everest of Illinois and Silas Towler of
Minnesota were represented. The bal
lot resulted: Everest. 299; Towler, 328.

Brothers of Nebraska were nominated for
Burgeon general, the former receiving 362
votes and the latter 203.
The vote for chaplain in chief was close.
Father Leary of Chapman. Kans., win
nmg from Jesse Cole of lowa by a vote
ot 252 to 279.
Previous to the election a. letter from
President Roosevelt to Commander in
Chief King asking him to "extend my
warmest congratulations to the comrades
there assembled and say" to them how I
regret that I cannot in person meet them
and express the affection and regard I
feel for them." was read, and a telegram
In reply was sent.
The recommendations In the annual re
port' of the commander in chief were ap
proved, as were those by the surgeon
general, the chaplain In chief and the
quartermaster general.
THREE APPOIXTMEVTS.

The members of the Transportation

Crane and E. S. Ciprlco at a banquet
given at the California Hotel laÃt even
ing, which proved one of the most In
teresting events of its kind the local
representatives of the "big traffic con
cerns have enjoyed In the history of
their organization.
S. F. Booth presided as toastmaster
and started the merriment of the even
ing-going; in. a- pleasing, speech, which
was followed -by the introduction of
some of the cleverest entertainers of
the club. Captain Leale recited- some
of his amusing, dialect stories and O. F.
Richardson told a few funny yarns that
kept 1 the laughter resounding through
the banquet hall. Among the other
speakers of the evening were Carleton
C. Crane and W. R. Alberger, two of the
most active and enthusiastic members
of the Transportation Club; Joseph
Dunley, J. F. Fugrazl, whose arrival at
Lombard-street wharf forty years ago
is an event that has strangely been
ignored by the history writers of the
State; Peter Lund, the heaviest smoker
in the employ of the Harriman lines,
and L. F. Cockrof t, whose knowledge
of color schemes is shown to advantage
in many of the "folders" of the steam
ship company of which he is the proud
general passenger agent. '
Special features of the evening's pro
gramme were songs and recitations by
Dr. Frank Rudolph and Frank â¢Coakley,'
two of San Francisco society's ' most
promising humorists, and a ballet dance
by Jules Clerf ay t. The Alcazar Quar
tet and Bennett's Orchestra also con

Lawyer Declares Firemen
Have No Riglit to Hypoth
ecate' Unearned Wages.
"City employes have no right to hypoth
ecate moneys which they have not earn
ed," was the contention of Attorney Cobb
yej>terday,\'acting t<*gSEJtfral fireman jwho^
are being -siied in JudgtefSloss'/ciurt: to*
recover money advanced to them "on their
warrants. ; , _\u25a0 *. \u25a0:\u25a0'\u25a0â¢ $ Â£ \u25a0â¢' i}ff ; - -"\u25a0 k+ \u25a0'
"It " is contrary to public policy to per
mit municipal emplqyes to k sign away
money, that they have' not, earned," main
tained " Attorney Cobb. '.'/It , Is contrary
to public policy f or. v firemen J not to pay
their debts," retorted .Attorney Cannon
for the Reliance Fidelity and Trust Com
pany. \u25a0 \u25a0.
Following are the firemen who are sued
by the trust company: Robert O. Pow
ers, Frank Flint, C. F. Leutardt, Patrick
Hogan, Patrick Nichols and Thomas R.
Walsh. A point that was emphasized by
Attorney Cobb was that the powers of
attorney given to -the company by the
firemen were merely blank forms and
that -.they were filled out later by the
trust company.
Judge Sloss will try the case at an
early date. \u25a0

Two years ago Frank Clazebrook of

of seeing a spring of water with gold
issuing with the aqua. Recently while
Inspecting the newly acquired farm In

BIG FIGHT
Followers of the Sport of
the Ring Lose Confidence
in the Bona Fides of
the Match ' at N Colma
OUT OF TOWN PEOPLE
CANCEL RESERVATIONS
Britt'S Cleverness and Per
fect Condition Are Ex
pected to Carry Him to
Victory Over Old Opponent
An Important conference vraa held at
Â»\u25a0 rarlj- boor thia morninc, as a re
unit of which It fa probable Eddie
Gnntr will referee the Britt->elson
firht. The Brltt* have been ufaotrn that
Aolan will not plve in, and after an
extended conference frith Manager
Coffroth, It was decided the referee
should be named at the rlngrside. This
meetlns was a last reaort to ntralghten
out the tangled skein.
Had it not been for the unseemly
equabble over the referee the flcht be
tween Brltt and Nelson at Colma this
afternoon would have been the most at
tractive lightweight battle in the history
of the Queensberry ring. The advance
sale indicated that more than $70,003 would
have been taken at the gate. Late yester
day afternoon Manager Coffroth said
many reservations had been canceled and
that the indications were the receipts
would hardly total $30,000.
With the wrangle over the referee came ,
disclosures which shook the faith of the
tportinc public in the bona fides of the
match. First came the news in The Call
that Nelson backed down on the side bet.
This was followed by the information that
the purse was to be divided, 60 per cent
to the winner and 40 per cent to the
loser. -: * . : . ,
Theee facts took all the romance out
of the match and reduced it to the com
monplace. None of the principals would
corroborate these facts until Manager No
lan, driven to desperation, blurted them
out.
The fighters still maintain an attitude
of hostility toward one another, but
whether tnls is the last of the theatrical-
Ism in this affair is a question.
UO.Ylill TO SIEKT FIGHTER.
The match to-day will be between a
great boxer and a great fighter, with all
the advantages in favor of the former.
Britt has trained on until his associates
believe he is a much better man than he
ever showed to be before. He has had
no setbacks in trainine ahd is bubbling
over with vitality and animal spirits-
Nelson's preparation has been contrary
to all rules of training, and he will prove
a veritable iron man if he shows anything
approaching his best form. His work has
all been on the Blow, heavy order, and he
has taken an incredible amount of pun
ishment from his training partners. These
are amateur boxers and they seemed able
to hit him at will with their heavily
padded gloves. . *-
If he allows Britt to hit him with the
force the latter will use in fighting and
with light gloves there is trouble In store
for the Dane. V.- ;
Britt* s weakest point is supposed to be
his hands. These are small and llght
boncd. and he is in danger of injuring
them on the lignum vitae head of the
Dane. In training Britt wears email pro
tecting pads Inside his gloves. His fight
ing cloves will afford him no such pro
tection.
Britt is one of the greatest tacticians
ever seen in the ring. He seems equally
at home in any 6tyle of fighting. He
has never been defeated, and, like the
great stake horse, he wins by what he
has to each time. He never seems to
disclose his real form, leaving people In
doubt as to what he could do if /pressed
to the limit.
BIHTT IS COXKIDEXT.
He has always been confident of his
ability to defeat Nelson at any kind of
fisticuffs. He has shown an inclination
for a route in the past, as witness his
twenty-flve-round meeting: with Canble.
In this he set a terrific pace in the
last five rounds, showing no signs of
weariness. Britt was not forced into
this match and from the outset he
showed supreme confidence in his abil
ity to win. He has always maintained
he could beat the Dane at any game
and expresses himself as being ready
to put it to the test.
In all Nelson's fights his remarkable
endurance has been his chief stock in
trade. He has taken a lot of-punish
ment from his various opponents and
when they shoHved signs of tiring he
â¢lias gone on and won. He concedes the
present fight to Brltt should it go the
limit.
Nelson^ has been the center of so
mtreh turmoil during the past month
that it must have interfered with his
training. In addition to that he seems
to have been trained by the old rule
of thumb methods and has taken a lot
of unnecessary punishment. If he steps
into the ring with the highest develop
ment of his fighting powers he will
upset all training traditions and will
enow he Is above all rules of health.
He was the picture, of a jaded, over
trained athlete when he arr:ved from
Larkspur ten days ago. Since then his
face has brightened up, but he has gone
on with, his severe exertions and has
net husbanded his vitality. He was ex
pected to improve if the fight went a
long distance, 1 but If he is overtrained
that will be impossible.
Owing to a lack of rolling stock the
Southern Pacific Company will be un
able to provide special trains. The reg
ular trains^ leaving Third and Town
send streets at 10:30 and 11:30 o'clock
will stop at Colma- The bulk of the
spectators will be carried on the Mis
sionrÃtreet cars,, which will run- on a
one-minute headway.
The two box offices for. the bleachers
and general admissions will \ open
promptly at 8: SO o'clock at Colma. The
box office at the main entrance will be
open at 11:30. The box office at 30

BUT WILL AGREE TO A CONFERENCES.
Manager Filly Nolan stated early this -morning he; would; have Battling. Nelson in the ring; at Golmaat i 130 o'clock this afternoon, ready to fight Britt,
but that the battle, would be off unless some one other than Jeffries could be agreed upon as a referee. NolaiV says this decision is -final, and that he will 'not take.
Jeffries under any circumstances. He says Nelson can .beat Britt,; provided lie* gets a square deal. "I ani ; afraid of outside influences," says Nolan . "In other words.
I fee! that z job is on nnd that I am to be the victim of it." Jeffries- still says he. will referee, the fight.: and ! the. Britts aver, .they.v.ill accept no one else. Everything
is settled except the referee question. Nolan says he will, be readyxto confer over another-man- at the ; last minute and will insist on.this .privilege.; otherwise he in-. ...

BRITT HAS THIS TO SAY:
I 'eel that I am In . better condition , for thin eodtext than ever
before during my career as a boxer. I think I have improved 50 per

BRITT SEEMS IN CONDITION
TO BATTLE FOR HIS LIFE
Completes His Training Work Without;
Having Had a Moment's Setback.
James Edward v Britt concluded his
course of training yesterday and peace
again reigns at Sheehan's villa on- the
beach. The rattle of the punching bag
was stilled. Only the: sound of the
booming -breakers on the not far dis
tant beach could be heard. â¢ Manager
â¢â¢Bill" Brltt had his softly modulated
voice under: control," until ; for the, first
time in days. It was but half a* tone
above a \u25a0whisper. There were 'no pic
tures of Manager Billy Nolan hanging
on the walls..; i .
Sparring Partner. Frank Rafael
played solitaire with : the cards \u25a0 in * a
quiet nook of the villa. .''Tiv";Krelirig
busied himself writing letters and
sending telegrams! Occasionally : the
telephone bell would ring, followed by
Manager "Bill" Britt's invariable' re
sponse to the query, \u25a0...'_\u25a0 Yes; yes; of
course. Jeffries referees the contest.
All right. G-o-o-d-'-b-y." James 13d-'
ward was at home to but few visitors.'
To all others he was. asleep. So .tran
quil: seemed; everything /that It ,' was
difficult to realize: the smoke of. a great
battle even then was curling skyward. '^
Jimmy Britt had occasion to be" sat
isfied with himself. > No; athlete ever
looked .in better condition; In the
forenoon he went. for a horseback ride.'
Shortly after 4 : o'clock, accompanied
by "TivV Krellng, Jimmy went for his
final spin on : the road and expected to
turn 133 pounds on his", return. \u0084
,-v Britt will leave Sheehan's villa in'
an automobile at* 9 o'clock this morn
ing for Harry CorbetfsresQrt on Ellis

COFFROTH
HAS TALK
WITH NOLAN
Danes Manager Eefnses to
Yield a Point When the
Promoter Goes to Colma
to Arrange Settlement
RESERVED SEATS ARE
STILL INBOX OFFICE
j Scene Is Likely to Result;
I if Nelson Is Persuaded;
to Leave -the Colma Ring'
Without Striking a Blow:
There will undoubtedly be a scene at
the Colma arena this afternoon ir Man
ager Nolan Insjst3 upon taking Nelson
out of the ring if he does not have hfs j
own way about the reieree. He will un
doubtedly receive a. warm reception from
the spectators under any conditions, but
the sight of the fearless Battling Dana,
walking out of the ring at vis manager's
behest is too much ta believe.
Early in the afternoon Club Manager
Jim Coffroth slipped quietly down to
Colma to hold a conference with Billy
Nolan and settle the question one way
or the other as a last resort. It was
taken for granted by the wise brigado
that everything would bo arranged in
a short time. When the news was
flashed along the. line about 10 o'clock
that Nolan had concluded to stand for
Jeff a mighty cheer went up and every
one seemed .-satisfied.
This condition of affairs lasted about
an hour, tihortly, after 11 o'clock Mr.
Nolan was sÂ«en to pass hurriedly along;
Ellis street' Some one extended hla
mitt and said, "Billy, I'm glad that you
have taken that bis fellow. It will bÂ«
all rijrht now. and every one Is satis
fied." - ' - . " *-..:
; For. answer Nolan looked . the- con*
gratulator in the face- and then turned
slowly around like a man In a trance.
"It's all a lie." said he. "Nothing has been
settled* yet and I am in the same po
sition. I will not stand for Jeff and If
some one else is not selected there
will be no fight. This is final.
â¢J Â«o not itke the stand Mr." Jeffrle3 '
hfts taken. In an afternoon paper he
announced that he. would referee this
fight in spite <Jf me. Now, no man 'can
take such a liberty with me and I 'will
not 'stand' for such" rough work. You
take it from me, Jeffries will ' not
referee this fight. I will see it de
clared off first; and all this "talk"- or fix-
InK thinjfs is wrons:. I. will not meet
Jeffries." I' have nothing to say to him
and therefore there is v np use wasting
time !n an interview."^ ._ :^ . : \u25a0 -^
After, this sweeping .statement a thÂ« â¢
world of sport was again subdued and
the line, once more Fettled down to 'try
to Hjuro out just what was going to
happen. The caae became m%)TO cam?
plicated than ever and many expressed
the opinion that as long as Nolan had
gone so far he. would 'sro thÂ« whole
route and that there would be no fight
this afternoon at Colma.
. Betting picked up for an hour after
the first flash of news was - received.
but as soon as it became known along
the line that Nolan would not stand \u25a0
for JenT ' the wagering again was' at a
standstill and no more money changed"
hands.
Manager Nolan's stand has simply
knocked the lump sum of $25,000 out
of the house. If everything had been
all right in the referee line the fight
would certainly have drawn $75,000 and
every ticket would have been taken up
on "Wednesday afternoon. The reserva
tion .list* was a record breaker and
every sport within a radius .of 500
miles' was \u25a0breaking his neck trying' to.
secure a pasteboard.
But v sudden change came over the
whole 'thing. '\u25a0; When Manager " Coffrotb/
counted up his reservation .Hat late"
Thursday, night he was amazed to. find
that a large percentage of seats -re
served for out-of-town^ sports had not
been" called for. ' Numerous telegrams
were later received . statin? that the
people who had reserved -the seats had
become distrusted over the tangle) and
decided not to come to the fight. Others
did not so to the trouble .to wrre. but
simply. let the whole matter drop ih'
disgust. m . -
Manager Coffroth "stated last nfgrht
that if the fight draws $50,000 he will
not only, be satisfied, but, delighted.*
From . present indications it^ would aj>-'
pear .that ~the"recetptV6f th'e'great bat
tle. If It is' fought, will not exceed $40,*- v
000, and perhaps 310.000 less would be a
more conservative and correct estimate.
Last night tickets of all kinds wera
offered for, sale along the line.- Many
scalpers who had crabbed bunches of
the precious pasteboards 'with the hope
of making: a young fortune were wllK
ing. to part with them at their face
values. â
The betting closed at 10 to 5% with
Brltt favorite late last night. At these
odds thÂ«re were few ' Nelson takers. In
fact, there was no betting to speak of.
There was a bis crowd at Corbett's.
tut every one seemed to be waiting* for
news.'|&BK *./.-\u25a0;.'
\u0084 The opinion was expressed last nighti.
that If Nolan persists on holding; out- at
the; last minute the battlina: Dane will
simply .kick over the traces and wads'
into the ring with Jeffries and Britt
and flsht^lt out .with. his old opponent.
This seems a* reasonable theory,, for
Nelsonwill surelynot see a laxga sun
or money si io away from him it ther*
is'anv^chaÃce* to get it. â¢<- â¢**\u25a0:â¢

SACRAMENTO. Sept. B.â A splendid
programme was presented at the State
Fair races to-day. The attendance was
very* large. A feature of the day was the
victory of Adam G in the free-for-all trot,
due to W. G. Durfee's superb driving.
Pettigrew, Durfee's entry, was scratched,
and the Los Angeles relnsman got behind
Adam G and drove him three fast. and
winning heats. Dr. Hammond was the
favorite, but he was never placed "better
than fourth. A
North Star again demonstrated that he

year. He beat the speedy Athasham for
the Stanford stake after the latter had
won the initial heat. North Star trotted
the second heat in 2:15, which was re
markably fast for the . new. track.
Four running races were decided, three
favorites landing first money. In the "first
running race Prince Magnet won, but if
Otis had made his move with Invoice a
little sooner the latter could have won.
In the last race of the day Mai Lowrle,
hard ridden, beat Llberto a half-length

Events at San Bafael
DEFEATS ABE SURPRISES
Championship Titles Go
to Strangers in Every, Co
ntest With Apparent Ease
f The tennis players from Southern Cali
fornia carried on* the honors at San Ra
fael-yesterday. Three events were com
pleted-; and all three championship titles
went to.. the .visitors. In only one contest
.did '-players from this section of the State
compete,* 'and they were beaten.
â¢ In* the- morning Miss Florence Button
and Harold Braly won the mixed doubles
championship, beating Miss Violet Button
and birapson Sinsabaugh in the finals.
*\u25a0 In , J the afternoon the finals of. the
women's singles and men's doubles ware
played.' In the former the contestants
.were- the -Misses Violet and Florence Sut-
f ton, and' they, furnished some high-class
tennis. ;>Mlas . Florence*, Button beat her
.sister in, straight sets. and will meet Miss
May ; Button, the coast , champion, in the
challenge match this afternoon.
t .The finals of the men's . doubles was a
highly interesting affair and was won
by Sinsabaugh and Braly. It took the
full five: sets to settle the question of su
premacy. Their opponents were . Reuben
â¢Hunt and Percy : Murdock. -
\u25a0 -The defeat of Miss Violet Sutton and
Slnsabaugh was a surprise. They are the
champions of Southern California and
were thought; to be the strongest team
on the coast. Miss Florence Sutton and
\u25a0Braly: proved' too clever for them and
\u25a0won the match In straight sets. Both sets
were closer than their scores would in
dicate. score was &-V *-*-
J At 1:30 /Miss Violet and Miss . Florence
Sutton met to determine who should chal
lenge MlsÂ» May Sutton. Those, who have
watched the games during the week fig
ured that -Violet was playing a better
'game thaji Florence this year, Florence
upset their calculations, however, by beat
ing her sister in straight seta. The score
was 6^4. 6-3. "' :
â¢ {Violet -played a more - brilliant game
than her sister, but the latter was much
steadier. In fact Florence has never
played better- tennis at San Raafel than
she did yesterday. Violet was effective
at the net, but Florence's deep returns
kept her siÂ«ter from the net position most
of the time.* Superior steadiness undoubt
edly won the day for Florence. If she
plays as j well as ; she did yesterday her
sister May, the world's champion, will
have to be at her best to beat her.
Slnsabaugh and Braly came to. life yes
terday afternoon and won from Hunt and
Murdock by: a narrow margin. After the
exhibition put up. by the visitors Wednes
day; afternoon few conceded them much
of a chance against ' Hunt, and Murdock.
They played a greatly Improved game
yesterday and the Alameda cracks found
them a trifle too strong,
r Hunt and "Murdock took the first set
without any trouble, and when they pulled
from 2-3 up to 5-3 m- the second set the
match "looked, to. be .about over. The
Southern California experts played a good
uphill game and took the set by a score
of 10-8.
Slnsabaugh and 1 Braly led all the way
in the third set' and won it by a score of
6-4. ; - â¢: '.-\u25a0' < â¢'-,\u25a0: .
.* Hunt and, Murdock came back strong
in the fourth set and won it without the
loss of a game. Sinsabaugh and Braly let
down a bit in this set while Hunt and
Murdock played their best tennis.
In the fifth and deciding set Slnsabaugh
and Braly outplayed their opponents and
from 2-2 on won quite easily. Both teams
played spasmodically, first one playing
good tennis for a spell and then the
other. I Braly and Blnsabaugh were more
effective at the net than their opponents.
Murdock played a fine game, but his op
ponents played a majority of tbe balls to
. Hunt. The latter was rather uncertain,
at times making brilliant kills and again
falling down on easy shots. The - score
was Â«, 10-8. 6-4, 0-â¬. 6-3.
Three matches" will be played to-day.
This morning at 10:30 Miss Violet Sutton
and Mrs. Bruce will meet Miss Vera
Crocker and Miss Ida Mearns forr the
women's doubles championship. At 1:30
the world's champion. Miss May Sutton,
and Miss Florence Sutton will meet for
the .women's | single championship.
Fried Adams and George Janes will come
together for the * men's singles - champion

SATURDAY v. ~. SEPTEMBER 9, \9Â§
REGISTER NOW.
FOR the purposes of the municipal election in November the
registration of voters closes on the 27th of this monthâSeptem
ber. The splendidly organized work of the Republican League
fhows a vast number of unregistered voters. We appeal to these
to do their duty and getupon the list, as a necessary qualification to
vote in November. There may be the best of tickets in the field
against the grafters and there will be the best of reasons why it
should be elected: hy* if Â«'\u25a0Â»\u25a0 -ho should support it are unregis
tered it will be defeated by default.
Every day discloses die weakness and inefficiency of the exe
cutive branch of the city government. It is powerful only for ille
gitimate purpose and use, and is powerless to do any of the good
and legitimate things of government. One argument made for it
on the street is that if it\vere guilty as charged by the press and
the Grand Jury and believed by the people it would be glad to es
cape punishment by retiring from power instead of seeking another
term. Let no one be deceived by this argument, for it is false. No
criminal manipulators or official power ever retired voluntarily.
Tweed, N after he was exposed and indicted, stood for the State Sen-r
ate in a Tammany district in New York and was re-elected.
The instinct of self-preservation, added to the desire for more
plunder, keeps such men in politics and makes them seek re-election.
If the people, by default or by direction, continue them in power,
they take it as not only vindication of what they have done, but as
a license to go on plundering and grafting.
If re-elected on its incendiary platform our municipal adminis
tration will feel the thrill of vindication and the license, of public
approval and its protection of profitable vice will become the main
thing among its activities. The charter in such hands becomes the
promoter of everything it was intended to prevent. Instead of pro
tecting what is right and decent, it removes all protection by plac
ing every safeguard of life, property and public revenues in the
hands of a gang that is without morals, decency or respect for the
law.
The peril here cannot be minimized. The most expert political
criminals that ever infested a city have by adroitness, artifice and
craft secured control of an organization they call the Union Labor
party. In its leadership are the scarred veterans of rascality, w r ho
have served under the flag of every robber boss in the history of
the city. They are past masters of the arts of demagogy and deceit
They have tried to identify everything vile in politics with the in
terests of labor in the imagination of working people, and the pity
of it all is that workingmen are the very people who *sufter most
from misgovernment. Â»
We say deliberately that this city is deprived of millions of
dollars in investments that would be made here but for the graft
and crime of the municipal administration. Last year the invest
ment in buildings in Los Angeles amounted to $12,000,000. Here it
was only $15,000,000, and we have three or four times the popula
tion of Los Angeles. We should have a building investment of
$30,000,000, and the greater part of it would go to labor. But men
will not invest, they will not build where a robber stands at every
corner of their building, representing the city government and
licensed to plunder half of every dollar that comes out of hiding to
furnish wages for labor. Every manufacturing activity of the city
and ever}- form of investment that makes work and . pays .wages is
under the incubus of a criminal and oppressive public administration.
Nothing is protected in its legitimate rights. But vice and crime
are protected in their illicit industries as long as 'they willpaythe
price.
It is pitiful that the laboring masses of the city should be made
the first and most helpless victims of a system that is installed in
their name and flourishes on their indorsement. The politicians
programme them, and at the other end of the programme is every
form of vice that has a dollar in it to divide with the programmers.
There is only one way to end this carnival of official debauchery.
It must be defeated by the united action and votes of the citizens
who are under no illusions of the imagination as to the class benefits
that go with public corruption. In this campaign it becomes neces
sary to treat the Mayor's platform as a political document, the declar
ation of a political party. Such treatment will be at once construed
into an attack upon labor by the experienced thieves and thugs and
their allies and partners, who know every trick in the game.
These men think that the labor vote is at the command of the
man who makes the loudest appeal to passion, prejudice and ig
norance. We think, however, they underrate the intelligence of
workingmen. These are as much interested in good government as
any others, from the standpoint of citizenship, and as wage earners
they are more interested than any others in the community. It re
mains to be seen whether they will relish being put into partnership
with the social sores and the ulcers of vice, out of which their politi
cal advisers make a profit that keeps them in drinks and diamonds.
Let every voter register and let us have a straight fight between
the grafters, the ballot-box stuffers, the cullies and panderers, and
the allied decency and good citizenship of San Francisco.
THE UNQUIET JAPANESE.
T APAN, having representative government, has also politics and
j parties. All have been united during the war, but peace
:S^; : brings opportunity to the politicians, and the outs improve it to
become the ins. In this the Japanese do not differ much from the
people of the United States. We all wanted the Spanish; war and
stood together during that brief tragedy, and then we divided over
the terms of peace and have been quarreling over them since.
The riotous disorders in Japan are evidence that, the people are
not quite as advanced as the statesmen. "The latter have won the
most conspicuous victory in history, by getting all that they went to
war for, and so much more that a money indemnity is cast in the
shade by the permanent advantages that will accrue to the indus
trial and commercial interests of the country. Still it" is possible
that the Ministry that made glorious war and still more glorious
peace will be overthrown. Komura is able but not popular in his
own country. He is a Harvard graduate and waited' long at" home
for a chance to rise and make use of his American education. During
this. waiting period the Japanese nicknamed him /'The Daylight
Lamp," their way of expressing entire uselessness, isince lamplight
is not needed by day. His chance came when he was sent as Min
ister, to Peking, and soon brought on the war with China, which
greatly disturbed Ito and the elder statesmen. The party of the outs
is taking advantage of Komura's unpopularity, and no doubt there
are frequent references to "the daylight Jamp" in the streets of
Tokio and Yokohama. But at the last wisdom Will /prevail
It is not to be wondered at that peace is unpopular. War is the
dream of Japan. The soldier is at the top of all classesjand has-been
for ages. But Japanese statesmen are wise above their countrymen.
They know that the pursuits of peace must make the nation, great:
The treat\' opens to them a vast and dazzling prospect. - In the Jap
anese polity and society the soldier must give way to the merchant
and artisan. x
The commercial conquest of Korea is now open; one of the most
valuable opportunities furnished by the war and the peace. Fol
lowing that will be the political conquest of the Hermit Empire. It
is destined to be a part of Japan. The commercial conquest of-Man
churia will go on concurrently, with that of Korea, and the Japanese
people, if they be wise, will find enough to do without breaking
heads over the last war or fretting about the next.

"I was walking across Madison square
soliloquizing on the. bench population of
the metropolis when a dainty ;,;: figure'
jumped up from a seat and grabbed 'me
frantically by the hand. I wasn't feeling
any too cheerful, and was about to shove
the fellow away when I caught a fleeting,
familiar look in the grime of his face.
"It took me a second or so to make
proper soundings, and when I struck
bottom I nearly fainted away. It was
one of- the biggest sugar planters in all
the Islands, a man worth his millions to
day.
"'Don't ask me to explain now,' he
said, 'but lead me to a place where they
have soap and towels'and beefsteaks.' '
"I thought my hotel filled the bill pret
ty well, and curbing a , curiosity that
nearly gave me apoplexy took him with
me. In an hour's time, he had finished
eating and was looking more like his old
self. . \. /\u25a0:;

"Then he unfolded a yarn that I
wouldn't have believed from any other
person in the world, even from -my
grandmother.
"He had come to . New York to see
the city a fortnight, before, and like
every one from the Pacific his Idea of
seeing New York was two weeks com
posed of days about twenty-three hours
long.
"Not being, carried away with the idea
of his own ability to take care of him
self here he very wisejy v went to a
first-class bank > down *Â«pn' "^Broadway,
and handed over $18,000 6f his roll 'to
the cashier, banking it in the ordinary
manner. After _that. he started out Ito
see what; might be seen'by^an'^observ-^
ant. person with ,a pocketbook'of 'ab*-*
normal .size. â".* '-.'<..:' ' \u25a0. ''. /;
"Two days later ; he found . that " he
had J8 in his clothes,. and: he had not
seen his j hotel " since he bade farewell,
to the register clerk.\ Naturally;' he
made his, way' down to. the bank and,
made out a check, for a thousandMn
order to. save himself the trouble of
another visit in a day.or so. .
"He walked up tothe paying teller's
window and shoved the check through,
asking for. it In small bills. A /chilly
stare and a blank look at the order
was his reward. ..... v
.' "I don't know. you,' said. the; clerk.
." 'Well, sonny, send for the cashier
who. took my account,' said the planter.
"The cashier came,' but he failed to
recognize, my friend. He was; not,
however, the man who had taken the
account, â¢ ,'. . i .. , , .
"The j officials began to be suspicious,
but after an eff ortÂ»he succeeded in de
scribing the person with whom he had
deposited his money. So graphic were
his words that the cashier and teller,
both exclaimed. 'Billings!'^
"The Hawaiian was relieved.
" 'Then trot out Mr. Billings 1 , he said.
"To his horror he was told that Bill
ings had left on vacation.
"That ended his attempt to cash the
check and he started to go to his hotel.
There another difficulty confronted
him. He had found the bank by the
.address on his check book, but he had
nooway/of Identifying his hotel.
"As-the only places he knew were the
bank; and Madison Square ; he went to
the s latter and spent the night on one
of the benches. The following morn
ing was given; up to ;-a.Jvain search' for/,
the hotel ~and expostulations ..at : the
bank, where -he was , finally ejected
forcefully by a porter. \ <
"Penniless, he went to 1 a telegraph
office and tried to get a wire through
to his agents in Frisco. , Unluckily his
clothes had been torn and. soiled dur
ing the affair at the bank, and the
telegraph official would not send the
message collect. By noon" he was with
out accent. '
"The remainder of the time until he
raet.me was spent in visiting hotels,
telegraph offices and lawyers. The lat
ter, to a man, would have nothing to
do with , him.'
"His clothes were- traded for others
of a cheap sort and a few cents to boot.
Each way lessened his chances of pull
ing out; of the hole he was in. â¢
"There was nothing of the quitter in
his make-up, however, and he deter
mined to get work. That; wasn't an.
easy Job In a summer month," but on
the morning when I met him he had
managed to get" a place tending a
switch on one of the streetcar lines.
-."If took me twenty-five minutes to

WHY IT WAS A HOLIDAY.
A certain well-known actor was com
plaining bitterly in the .Lambs' Club be
cause there were two extra holidays in
February. It was just after the Lincoln's
birthday matinee.
"It's an outrage on us," said the actor.
"We have eight performances a week,
thirty- two In this short month, anyway.
And now here are these two extras, that
we must give without any extra pay."
"Well," said Joseph Herbert, "it seems

fifty applied for the place, relates the
New Orleans Times-Democrat. Out of
the whole number he In a shore time
chose one, and sent the rest away.
"I should like to know." said a friend,
"on what ground you selected that boy.
He had not a single recommendation
with him."
"You are mistaken." said the gentle
man: "he had a great many."
"He wiped his feet when he came In
and closed the door after him; showing
that he wa3 orderly and tidy.
"He gave up his seat Instantly to that
lame old man; showing that he was kind
and thoughtful.
"He took off his cap when he came to,
and answered my questions promptly
and respectfully; showing that he was
polite.
"He lifted up the book which I had
; purposely laid on the floor, and placed it
on the table, while alt the rest stepped
over it. or thrust It aside; showing that
he was careful.
"And he waited quietly for his turn In
' Ptead of pushing the others away; show
ing that he was modest.
"When I talked with him I noticed that
his clothes were carefully brushed. . his
hair In nice order, and his teeth as white
as milk. When he wrote his name t
observed that his finger nails were clean.
Instead of being tipped with jet. like the

LAWYERS ARGUE
WITTMAN SUIT
Judge Hunt Orders Case of
Ex-Chief of Police Sub
mitted to Him on Briefs
TILTS ARE FREQUENT
Counsel Spirited in Conten
tions Over Plea for Re
instatement by the Board
The suit of George ,W. Wittman to be
reinstated as Chief of Police of this city
was called for trial in Judge Hunt's court
yesterday.. Attorney Alexander O'Grady
represented the Police Commissioners
and Assistant City Attorney Brobeck of
the City Attorney's' office, Congressman
Julius Kahn and ' Judge *Ix)uderback ap
peared for Wittman. After hearing the
arguments Judge Hunt ordered that the
case be submitted on briefs. Besides re
instatement the plaintiff seeks a writ of
mandate compelling Auditor Baehr to al
low him salary from the time of, sus
pension.
Kahn contended that fthe removal of
Chief Wittman was . illegal on the fol
lowing grounds: Because the Police Com
missioners had no authority Ho remove
him; because the removal "was , not made
by a full meeting of the* board; and on
the ground that inasmuch as Wittman
had been regularly appointed Chief he
should have been permitted to serve the
term of four years as provided for in
the charter.
The attorney*' for the plaintiff argued
that the board had not the right to sus
pend Wittman. He emphasized the fact
that at that time the board was com
posed of but three members, Commis
sioner Hutton having been removed just
before the trial.
J. George Boyne, secretary of the com
mission, was on the stand most of the
morning and was questioned as to the
proceedings at the Wittman "trial. "Kahn
tried to introduce stenographic notes
taken by a private stenographer, but the
testimony was overruled by Judge Hunt.
Several tilts between O'Grady and Kahn
occurred. "You can't read something into
a law that is not there," said J Kahn,
hotly. "No," retorted O'Grady, with equal
heat, "Nor can you read something Into
a law that is not there."
One of the points made by Kahn 4 was
that the Chief of Police was not a mem
ber of the Police Department. Kahn
maintained that tKe office of Chief is dis
tinct and separate from the department.
WORK ON NEW LINE
BEGINS ON MONDAY
Arra ngenient s for Construc
tion of Ocean Shore Road
Completed.
The directors of the Ocean Shore Rail
road met yesterday and completed the
awarding of contracts for construction
of the new coast road between, this city
and Santa Cruz. _ It was later announced
by Chief Engineer Rogers that C. E.
Loss, the well-known Eastern contractor
who will build the line, will begin -work
next week.
The road will be. eighty-two miles long,
double tracked, and will cost $2,000,000. It
will extend out Army street to Barne
ville avenue, thence to Marengo street,
where a subway will be built to, Mission
street, and from that street it will be
extended to and along Alameda avenue
and crossing Onadago street it will con
tinue on through the \ Spring Valley
ranch southward. A branch line will be
built in the Richmond District.
The first work on the road will begin
on the Spring Valley ranch, where Con
tractor Loss will establish a base of sup
plies, and from that point he will proceed
to cover the entire distance between San
Francisco and Santa Cruz. On. division
7, commonly designa _d as the Mount Ped
ro section, of the road,. the heaviest work
will be encountered by the contractors,
for -they will have to move more than
7,000,000 yards of earth and half a million
yards of rock in the grading of the road
bed and the construction of six tunnels.
Between 1200 and 1500 men will be em
ployed on the job, which Loss has con
tracted to finish In twelve months. :
Material for the line will be shipped to
a point off the Mount Pedro promontory,
where it will be transferred to. the shore
by means of two aerial tramways. All
the tunnels will be doubled tracked and
the entire roadbed constructed under the
most modern plans. The company has
already placed Its order for 70-pound
rails and is preparing to order Its rolling
stock.

SUGGESTS A WAY
TO WOLD GEMS
California Diamond to Be Saved
The Bul if rog Mining District Lively
State Mineralogist Aubury has just is-
Bued from the Calif ornta j State Mining
Bureau a bulletin relating to gems, Jewel
ers' materials ' and ornamental |j stones of '
California.' The matter was prepared by.
Dr. George F. Kunz. .The interest in the
bulletin arises largely from the fact that
the industry, which is described," is 1 com
paratively, a hew one In^: this .State, but of
growing importance, the value of the out
put increasing annually. â¢â¢
Some surprise. will be occasioned by the
long.llst of gems. to be found in California
as native products. These include the dia
mond, corundum, topaz, spinel, beryl, gar
net,' tourmaline, .: quartz,-' chalcedony,
chrysoprase, " Jasper, opal,' alblte, ortho
clase, jade, lapis lazuli, meatite, turquoise,
amber,: catseye, obsidian and many others. ;
Dr. Kunz made a' somewhat astonishing
statement., "Many of the mineral products
of California,"^ he :; writes, .."are ; better
known and better represented ; abroad
than \ they, are at. home. ; j The : . tourmaline,
gpodumens : and other gems as familiar
now to experts and to collectors as gold
are better known to the residents of Rus
sia," Spain or^ Germany than to the in
habitants of the Golden .State, whence
i they came.' It is a singular fact that these
gems are better represented in the Ameri
can Museum of Natural History in New i
York, the United States National Museum ]
at Washington, the - British Museum In ]
London and other great institutions In the '
East and; abroad than they^are;ln the;
State Mining Bureau of California or the ;
State University at Berkeley, both . of
which have collections that rank well for
the authenticity and the; richness of their i
Specimens and for their. : magnificent ex- |
amples of foreign minerals."
Dr. Kbnz btlieves that the Un t.d B ates :
Geological Survey, which ia projecting a
special, study of the occurrence of plati
num in California and elsewhere in the
Pacific States, may discover many dia
monds if attention is directed to that
gem. The reason for this la th%tthe dia
mond, being one of; the heavier minerals,
is almost invariably met with In the rlf-'
fles with gold and platinum.
SOUTH AFRICAN METHOD.
If diamonds are to be round Dr. Kunz
suggests the adoption of the new grease
board separator used in the South African
diamond mines. In the opinion of Dr.
Kunz this might prove a valuable adjunct
to some of the present gold stamps, or
in the sluces, to detect the occurrance of
diamonds. While almost .all other min
erals pass over a board coated with mut
ton tallow, when such a board is ,vl-,
brated, all diamonds that, are ~ present
adhere to the tallow ano/can thus be
separated. With a contrivance of this
kind diamonds down to tne size of a pin
point are saved in the South African
diamond washings, while otherwise they
surely would be lost.
While there may be some incredulity
concerning large diamond discoveries in
this State, Dr. Kunz shows that these
precious stones have been found in eight
counties, which are: Del Norte, Trinity,
Plumas, Butte, Nevada, El Dorado, Ama
dor and.Tulare. Del Norte .and Trinity
have yielded only minute diamonds in the
sands of Smith Rivc-r and Trinity River.
Tulare "County." belonging to San Joaquln
section 'of "the great California valley, \ls
represented so far only'by a. single dia
mond, from Alpine Creek. V- The o.her five
counties are all" in the region drained by
thÂ« Sacramento River. El ' Dorado, Butte
and Amador have yielded " the ' greatest
number, and Nevada the largest .stdneâ
that of seven and one quarter caratsâ
but only one or two others. Plumas
County has two localities, Gopher Hill
and Upper Spanish Creek, where a few
small diamonds have been found in sands
rich In heavy minerals. The otheri.coun
ties named have, so far, furnished most
of the diamonds 'Of California.
Dr. Kunz calls attention to the fact
that from the Volcano district in Amador
County a number of diamonds have. been
found, among them one of the largest,
a pale straw colored, crystal,â weighing
255 milligrams. Butte County, includes"the
Cherokee Distrlst. where sixty, or more
have been found;- also- Yankee Hill and
Oroville, each, of which has; yielded sev
eral. El Dorado County has five or six
localities near Placerville: where diamonds
have been discovered. v
CONDITIONS FAVORABLE.
"A similarity is found by Dr. Kunr
in the geological conditions in Cali
fornia and those- to be found in the
regions where diamonds are j discovered
In: Brazil and South ; Africa/ In Bra
zil the matrix is r a gravel and Is fre
quently; cemented into a conglomerate
by oxide of iron.' In Africa 'the dia
mond ; gravels contain associated min
erals similar to those found in some
of the California" placers, : notably in
those of^ Butte County, where zircons,
garnets and; rutile are found.
. The great .variety of gems: found in
California is Indicated by.;the mention
iof rthose heretofore; alluded % to. At
present ' the' gem industry J does- not
represent a large annual value as com
pared to the output of^ gold and some
other' minerals." r - r ? '
i ~ Dr. ; Kunz has : a wide In
connection with the discovery: of gems
in i Calif ornia:- ' - His ; :belief - that dia
monds may ' be discovered > nibre
numerously jin this {State T* than.;;, they,

A Goldfield . correspondent - writes that
the coming of. the railroad to Goldfield
has been the signal for a gold mining
boom at Bullfrog. ; j: People are coming
in from all directions.
.. Every lautomobUo that: leaves .Gold-,
field and Las Vegas for Bullfrog is
filled to its utmost capacity and it is
necessary, to secure passage ahead to
be able to get through on any specified
[day.-. Hoter accommodations arertaxed
; to the utmost, and,' although the sound
j ofithe carpenter's hammer' can be heard
everywhere.tltis not believed that the
facilities jfor the housings of the hun
dreds that , are flocking into the dis
trict will be adequate for many weeks
;to come. The to wnslte company is, In
I the hands of millionaires; who have
1 platted a town. Every "aid, that money
can give is at hand to facilitate the
quick of 'a. mining: camp
on lasting" lines.*. Men .of money; and
mining- experts who control vast capital
are there, and so is the; better, element
from other successful mining camps of
the past decades^â Leadville^ Cripple
Creek, Butte, Tonopah and Goldfleld.
â¢ ORB BODIES'ARE FOUND.!
Great ore bodies have been found
within * a few months on Bonanza
Mountain,, Ladd Mountain and Mont
gomery Mountain, all within a radius
of two miles from the town of Bullfrog,
and" the coming of the railroad makes
the. shipment of ore possible. Mines
that are now sacking ore are the orig
inal Bullfrog,' on Bonanza Mountain ;
the Eclipse, which lies near the Gib
raltar mine, on Bonanza Mountain: the
Gibraltar mine; and the Denver and the
Bullfrog extension mine, adjoining the
original Bullfrog, "have ordered sacks
in anticipation of an early . shipment.
The Gibraltar will be the first. of the
Bullfrog properties _X.o begin the use of
power drills. *

FAMILIAEITY BESENTED
Salesgirl Cuts Her Employer
Across Face With Bawhide
Quirt and Vanquishes Him
ALAKEDA, Sept. Â«.â Relenting the
familiarity of being chucked under her
â¢hapely, dimpled chin by her employer,
Christopher Grau, pretty Miss Myrtle
Hurtt. a salesgirl, snatched a rawhide
riding whip from a rack in the store at
1626 Park street to-day and lashed her
asnoyer in vigorous style. She cut him
Across the faoe and head with the sting
ing quirt co fast and hard that Grau was
forced to beat an ignominious retreat and
sought refuge from the maddened maiden
by crawling into an empty crockery
barrel. â¢ â¢ ' ' ;.-."'\u25a0
Mrs. A. J. Hurtt, mother of the young
woman who showed that ehe was toU
*.b2e to protect herself ' from what she
deemed an insult, was an eyewitness to
the rawhiding of Grau. but was power
less to stop hostilities, which terminated
Â«nly when the man In the case was safe
in the barrel and Miss Hurtt was out of
wind.
Grau conducts a general notion store
and had employed Miss Hurtt, - who is
the daughter of Mr. and Mrs. A. J. Hurtt
of 1116 Park avenue, as clerk and sales
lady. She quit his employ c few days
ago because of some misunderstanding,
but was induced by her mother to re
enter Grau's employ to-day. It was while
the young woman and her mother were
conferring with the merchant that he
chucked Miss Hurtt under the chin and
the horsewhipping followed.
Speaking of the Incident later Miss
Hurtt said: "I considered that Mr. Grau
was getting too familiar when he patted
roy chin and when he repeated his act
despite my protest I took a whip to him
and he took to the barrel."
Grau achieved notoriety some months
ago by obtaining a license to marry a
young lady of this city. The wedding
never occurred, Grau stating that the
reason be did not make the young lady
his bride was because her parents de
manded that he pay for the wedding
drees of the bride-elect.

Orfton Crop Bolletln.
f^~7b* report of Edward A. Beals, section 41
\rÂ»-;tor. United States Weather Bureau, for the
tÂ«goa Crop Bulletin, week ended September
ft. Is aa follows:
No precipitation of consequence occurred
throughout the State during thÂ« last week and
all la^Â« crops, with the e&ceptlcn of corn and
hops, are in need of a good, soaking rain.
Light frosts occurred Thursday morning en
some of the bottom ltscs In Southern Oregon,
but. no damage resulted therefrom.
Threshing it practically .completed in WeÂ»t
ern Oregor.. whik east of the Cascade Moun
tains this work continues under favorable cir
cumstances. The yield of both wheat and bar
ley continues good in the Columbia and the
Grand Ronde valleys, but in the Willamette
Val'iey and Southern Oregon the grain yields
were generally below the average.
Hope made satisfactory advancement and
the crop is about r^ady for harvesting; pick
ir.jr will become general the firrt of next week.
The vines are free of vermin and it is expected
th<Â» quality will be food. Com is doing nicely
end a ia^'ge crop is promised. Field oniens are
Ixring pulled. Late potatoes and gardens are
do'ng poorly, owing to Jack of rain.
P^are and prunes are ripe and being gath
ered. Pfa.Â»* are abundant, but prunes will
average about half ot a full crop. Aj-ples are
tmail tr. size and fri well-kept orchards aa
average crop will be harvested.
Stock os the rar.ges continue in fairly gocd
condition: in the dairy districts cattle are
losing . f.Â«-sh and there is a marked falling eff,
in the miik supply.
The *upplj- o( Prune*.
The Ntw York Journal or Commerce says
"The prune situation, s.j far as the attitude of
sellers ia concerned, appears to rain strength
daily. Latest sdvicea ty mail from the coast
state that the fact that the crop is two or
three we*ks earlier than usual, with half the
Earta Clara Valley crop already on the trayt,
lends special importance t* estimates made at
this time, and these indicate that the output
will fail 25 per cent below the smallest esti
mates heretotore made, which would make it
afc^ut Ss.ouij.oiH) pounds, against 1C0.G00.000 last
yyear. The prunes arÂ« said to be drying out
i^-.or* than usual, and consequently the propor
tJaa of larpe Bises will be much leas than ex
pected. Instead or running largely to 40-50s
and SO-COs with a good percentage of 30-40s it
la now expected that the milk of the crop will
average 5&-60s and tSO-7Os with only a fair per
cer.tage of 40-.V* and few 30- 40 a. One of the
â¢trosgest features of the situation Is that this
â¢eascn's crop comes on a virtually bare market,
the 1f50.00a.000 pounds, including crop and
carry-over, that were available last season
he.v-.r.g been practically exhausted. It is now
eÂ«J mated In some quarters that counting the
traaU balance carried over from last eeascn
the ectire available supply of California prunes
this year will not exceed â¬5,000,000 pounds.
Last year 50.000,000 pounds werÂ« exported,
leaving 110.000,000 pound* for hornÂ» consump
tlaa. Out of this season's crop there Is said
to havo b*Â«n sold enough u> reduce the supply
for hotae consumption to 50,000.000 pounds, or
\u25a0boot half the quantity consumed laet year,
aooorÂ£!agÂ«to the estimates above riven."

Vtnrtfl and hesitated In an uncertain man
Â£w, *Â« Â«v the case yesterday. But on active
fcurisr from the first hour established a level
of prices well above those of yevterday and it :
wu about this level that the day's fluctua- \u25a0
tlons oeeuiTSd. The bear element was Ira- ;
pressed apparently with the evidence of re
sista&oe In the market and by some large buy-
Ing that was attributed by current supposi
tion to the account of a large banking and
financial interest for the purpose of support
ing pri&M. TtlÂ» Is a new development in tho
t*e*nt situation and Intimidated the bears.
London also bought largely during the activ
ity of , thÂ« first hour, although the original
aouroa of cabled buying orders are always
open to suspicion. London Itself was not con
spicuously cheerful and was under the influ
ence of yesterday's advance In the bank rate.
Privs.tÂ« discounts therÂ« made an additional
advance ar.d the absorption of cold by Paris
conthiued unabated, while further engagements
were made for shipment to South America
Borne relief was caused In purely speculative
quarters by ths rallnre to appear of the day's
stock market disaster, which wbs foretold In

professional operator. Strength was^hown by
Canadian Pacific, Union Pacific and Atchison.

average for the week. Otherwise gains were
Quite uniform and did not vary far from a

was Inferred from the absence of flurry in the

Fub-treasury operations of $4,3(15,000. On the
direct movement by express the banks have
continued to lose, and it Is believed that tie

pressed disappointment at the volume of busi
ness, as' it was generally expected that local
retailers wftutd: be laying. in extra supplies for
the holiday trade. Such was not the case,
however, and mo*t of the buying for holiday
nceil.s will be done during the early -hours to
day. The market was still badly congested
wiih Peaches, a large portion of . the offerlnes
being of pcor quality, and such stock was b*lns
pressed tor sale at low rates. Table Grap<a
continued to arrive fresly and low prices ruled
for all varieties, small packages particulaily
being weak owing to the absence 0/ . demand
for shipment. Wine Grapes were active and
firm at the previously, quoted rates. Bartfett
Pear 3 and fine Gravenstiin Apple* were tirm'.y
held, while cooking Pears and the lower grades
of ApplÂ«s were offering freely at weak pricss.
Quinces. Pliyns and Prunes were steady, while
Figs ruled weak, 'the outside quotmion for the
latter being obtained only for large \u25a0 packages
from the river districts. Melons remained
weak under large arrivals and Berries con
tinued, quiet. Stocks- of \u25a0 Citrus goods were
moderate and all descriptions were quoted
steady to" flrm.

THORN IS PAID
IN SMALL COIN
Purser of Liner Coptic Has
Enough Nickels to Wear
.Out a New Slot Machine
FARE FOR TWO PUPPIES
Son of Eastern Millionaire
Settles Dog Freight and
Bar Bill in Small Coin
There is a shortage of nickels in Hono
lulu, and Purser Charles Thorn of the
liner Doric has more of the 5-cent tokens
than any purser on any Pacific liner ever
before had in hie custody at one time.
It .ill came about because Thorn rubbed
the son of a millionaire the wrong way.
E. 1* Fanshawe was born in New York
City of rich parents. He cut his teeth on
a golden spoon and trod a gilded pathway
to young manhood. About a year ago
Young Fanshawe, with four other sons of
wealthy Eastern families, started out to
tcur the Orient. They returned yesterday
on the Doric.
At Hongkong Fanshawe bought two
Japanese pugs of high degree, and they
came on board the Doric witif the Fan
shawe baggage. The dogs were placed in
the care of the butcher and settled down
to enjoy the voyage across the Pacific.
The fare of the two dogs on the Doric
from Hongkong to San Francisco amount
ed to $25. A few days out of port Purser
Thorn asked Fanshawe to settle up for
the dogs so comfortably settled down un
der the butcher's care.
"All right, purser," said Fanshawe. "I
have no money now, but will pay you
when we reach Honolulu, where I can get
eorr.e more."
Thorn demurred.
"No use making a fuss," protested
Fanshawe. "I have no money with me,
but will be able to draw on my letter of
credit at Honolulu."
Thorn still protested, and during the
trip is said to have made Fanshawe's life
miserable by dilating on the inconvenience
caused by Fanshawe's unsettled freight
bill. It kept his books open, he said, and
â¢was not regular, and, how did he know
that Fa'nshawe could get the money at
Honolulu.
To all of Thorn's protests Fanshawe
returned the answer, "I -will pay you at
Honolulu."
Fanshawe's friends wearied of the pur
ser's refrain and offered to pay Thorn.
This Fanshawe would not allow.
"I will pay him at Honolulu."
At Honolulu Fanshawe went ashore
taking with him a dress suit case. A few
hours later he returned to the ship, per
epiring but happy. He went direct to
Thorn's office.
"Now, purser, give me that freight re
ceipt and my wine chips and I'll settle
the whole business. I had a -hard time
petting it. but 1 said I would do it, and 1
got it."
"Sixty-four dollars altogether," said
Thorn, handing Fanshawe his receipts.
'â¢All right. I think ybu'll find that all
right," and Fanshawe opened his suit
ease and poured 1290 nickels on the pur
ser's desk.
"And he troubled me no more," said
Fanshawe yesterday.
The dogs, however, are quarantined on
Angel Island because Fanshawe lost their
bill of health, and deportation or chloro
form may await them In the near future.

Roos was driving his automobile on a

SAYS DAUGHTER
IS INNOCENT
Mrs. Troy Befuses to Believe
That Edena Has Done Any
thing Wrong With Howe
DESERTED WIFE UPSET
Cannot Realize That Hus
band' Could So Cruelly
Leave Her and the Child
Mrs. Troy, the mother of gay Edena
Troy, cannot believe that her daughter
has run away with Dr. Robert C. Howe,
the clerical medico who made a reputa
tion as a breaker of hearts when he was
a clerk in Kibbler* drug store.
With a true mother's Itove she still
clings to the hope that her missing
daughter, who stole 5400 from her, has not
joined forces with the gay young physi
cian, and that at any moment her child
will return to the paiental roof. Edena's
brother, however, takes a different view
in the matter. He never liked Dr. Howe
and he was opposed to the many noc
turnal and diurnal visits that were con
stantly made by the married LÂ»othario
during his mother's absence. .
At times he' told Edena he was going
up to see Mrs. Howe and tell her how
often Dr. Howe came there. Edena al
ways quieted the boy down and told him
htat the visits of Dr. Howe were purely
of a professional nature. The brother,
however, was greatly opposed to the
meetings between his sister and the mar
ried doctor.'
Mrs. Howe, the deserted wife, is becom
ing more and more excited and upset as
the days go by and she heafs no reports
01' her missing husband. She said yester
day:
"I cannot yet realize that Robert has
deserted me. It don't seem possible. 1
know he has gone and I know that on last
Saturday he took all his surgical instru
ments away from his office In the Barce
lona building. But notwithstanding all
this I cannot believe he has deserted me
for good and all. I am really in a sort
of trance. All day long I have been an
swering telephone calls from * his friends
and my friends. They are all aghast at
his action and cannot account for his
running away any more than- I can. My
little girl, Lorella, is sick. She is only 3
years old, but the dear little child knows
something is wrong by the anguish I am
suffering. Why should our home be
broken up by this woman, and what In
fluence can she have over him to steal
him away from his wife and child? Rob
ert's old mother is broken-hearted over
his actions, but refuses to believe he has
left me for good.
"I am sure he cannot be very far away
from the State. When the 5400 taken by
the partner of his flight gives out, what
will they do? The detectives are still on
their track and 1 suppose we shall soon
hear of them."
Health Officer Ragan yesterday notified
the Civil Service Commission of the sus
pension of Sanitary Inspector Robert C.
Howe for failing to report for duty. The
Civil Service Commission will give the
suspended official a trial, and if he does
not answer the summons his suspension
will be made permanent.
SEWER SYSTEM MUST
BE RECONSTRUCTED
Proposed Municipal Geary
â¢Street Road Will Entail
Large Expenditures.
Mayor Schmltz yesterday called " a
conference in his office for the purpose
of taking steps to, build necessary
sewers along the line of the proposed
Geary street road which the municipal
ity proposes to operate on rltsr Its own ac
count. Commissioner of Works Aigel
tinger and Engineer Stut, who is pre
paring the revised plans for the sys
tem, were present.
It was decided that sewers will have
to be constructed on Tenth . avenue
from Fulton to A streets and In Point
Lobos avenue from Presidio avenue, to
Josephine avenue in order to drain the
conduit designed to hold the electric
wires by which the cars v.'ill be pro
pelled.
Acting City Engineer Morser will be
at once directed by the Board of
Works to prepare the necessary plans
for the two sewers, "the expense of
which will fall upon the owners ' of
property fronting on the streets named.
At the conference it developed that
the city will be called upon to improve
the sewer system on other portions
of the route of the system. TJhls is so
in the case of the sewer on Geary
street from Buchanan to Stelner, which
Is too small to carry off the storm
waters, especially after the electric
conduits are Installed. Morser will
also prepare the plans for the recon
struction of the sewer described .as
well as other portions required to tie
enlarged or modified. The expense of
the work was not reckoned in the
original estimates for the conversion of
the road and the Supervisors will be
obliged to make provision for the work
which will \u25a0 entail an additional ex
penditure of thousands of dollars.
Morser's. report on the subject will be
filed in a few days so that the work
may not be ,delayed.

THE^SANFRANGISGOVGALL,; SATURDAY, SEPTEMBER 9,. >1905:
SOCIAL CODE OF VALLEJO
RECEIVES HARD JOLT.
To It Is Ascribed
. Uncouthness of
Bootblack.
Visits City Home
\u25a0and Is Beaten by
'His Host. ;
JAMES C. CRAWFOR
George Washington and Martha, his
wife, both of sable hue, informed Po
lice Judge Mogan that the battering : of
R. W. Jones in their home on \u25a0 Moul
ton street was amply provoked by that
gentleman's conduct while partaking
of .their hospitality. If his manners
were fairly reflective of the code of
social etiquette maintained by the
colored haut ton of ' Valle jo, t whence he
came, then Mr. and Mrs. , Washington
could only opine that said code was in
need of most radical revision. Some of
the things that Mr. Jones said and/did
while he was a guest, of the Wash-,
ingtons would have shocked, even the
sense of propriety, possessed by San
Francisco's Afro-American sans culotte.
How had Mr. Jones offended, might
the court inquire? . .. '
By his general "freshness," Mr.
Washington replied. It was : Jones'
wont to come from Vallejo two or three
times a week to visit the Washingtons.
and frequently, had they endeavored to
show to him the uncouthness of his
behavior. Their words of counsel, how
ever, seemed to have been forgotten
just as soon as he left their presence,
for on his succeeding visit there was
no palpable reform of -either his de
meanor or his actions. ' . \u25a0
Charity prompted the Washington*
to overlook many of Mr. Jones' smaller
offenses, but on the occasion which led
to the battery by Mr. Washingtons and
his arrest a saint on earth could not
have rgnored the provocation therefor.
What particular "don't" did Mr.
Jones violate' on that occasion? the
Judge wanted to know.
"Ah might ez well tell de. whole
story en hey done wif It," said Mr.
Washington. 4 :;
"Pray, do," rejoined his Honor. "We
are all attention." '
"Well, sah, et wuz dis way: Mlstah
Jones drapped in teh visit iz, 'en eh
young lady wuz : callin' on ; iz at'de
time. Jes* ez soon ez he kern inVo,be
gan teh cut up eh show off 'fo' de young
lady, en his cemdick wuz so â¢ soan'lous
dat we wuz 'shamed ob -knowln' 'im.
We tried teh stop his antics, by eskin'
'bout de folks in I Vallejo, but 'c wuz
so daid set on makin' eh 'pression^on
de young lady dat 'c wudn't lissen : teh
nuffin' .we sed. Ah stud.'e's- monkey
tricks ez well ez. Ah cud tillhe.slaps
de young lady's face, den slaps^mah
wife's face, den slaps de baby's face, en
den Ah goes fo' 'im. Ah hit '.'invon de
head wif mah fohty-fo*. Dat Ah'll kln
fess, but Ah dld't hit mo' 'an, twice, en
de weapon wuzti't bent."
wMr. Jones, after displaying 1 several
scalp -wounds to the bench;; den led that
he had ever outraged any common rulÂ«
6â¬ good society while he was a; gues{
of the Washingtons. In that! connec
tion he would like to remark -that the
battering of a visitor's head /.with a
44-caliber .revolver would hardly, be
pronouncedXproper hospitality by the
social mentors of Vallejo, : despite. the
disparaging^ comment <to which \u25a0-â¢ they
had just been subjected by. the-Wash
ingtons. All that he done ; to . provoke
that battery was to ."cut a- few: didoes'!
for the amusement of the baby. No
person's face was- slapped by him.
As for ."showing/)" off", .'-before '..the
young lady, or attempting to 'win her
admiration, he was not so destitute of
feminine acquaintances ; as , ;\u25a0 to ; be Im
pelled to do either ;of "those U things:
The- fact' that' he was a bootblack and
Mr. .Washington a r , barber ,dld j not,? in
his opinion, make him that gentleman's
social inferior and therefore he re
sented that gentleman's assumption of
dictatorship as- to ;what . did^orV. what
did ; not constitute^ proper^ manners. T :
Case continued till next Thursday.
Joseph : Dominguez,' a trainer of horses,
was . sauntering, along; Kearny street last
Thursday . evening when chance led J him
into acquaintanceship \ f with .William . Gor
don, of cadaverous mien. Being a strang-f
er in; the townV and c: having ; money â¢to

The twain : toured' Chinatown, and Mr.

regaled ' by '; what :i he il saw, ";:, heard ' and

then Mr.> Gordo- suggested ; that they
', "take in" . the ' Barbary-. Coasts .â¢\u25a0;'.": .'\u25a0\u25a0'\u25a0' '.. .'\u25a0"- :\u25a0

At the; intersection '. of , Washington

Thus encouraged, Mr. Dominguez per
mitted himself to be swung as his partner
willed until he was breathless, . when Mr.
Gordon relinquished his embrace. Feeling
unwontedly light when he resumed -his
walk 'coastward. . Mr. . Dominguez felt of
his right-hand hip. pocket, wherein he had
deposited a chamois skin sack containing
$63 In gold; coin, and found the pocket
empty. \u25a0.â¢-\u25a0â¢ ; ; \u25a0 ' y -. . . . -'VV
"I have lost my money !" he shrieked,
and Mr. Gordon instantly dashed away,
shouting, : "You . must a-drbpped itâwait
there till. l search for It. Mr. Dominguez,
however, ignored, the suggestion and pur
sued Mr. Gordon, yelling, "Stop thief!" |
Patrolman Mills, captured Mr. Gordon
and subsequently found the bag . of cash
where it had been thrown by the fugitive
as he. flew. The grand larceny case was
continued till Monday: by Judge Fritz.
Judge Fritz's â¢ endeavor to effect a j re
conciliation between Mr. and Mrs. George
Ferguson (both colored) was \u25a0\u25a0 firmly re
pulsed by^ the lady. It was absolutely im
possible for her, she declared, to either
forgive or forget the slapping of her jaw
by George, when she protested against
his frightening of their babe by voicing
a^ lullaby at it. Besides, she felt certain
that if George were released from custody
he would "jump de town." leaving her
and the infant t6 exist as best they could.
Therefore she desired that he \u25a0be im
prisoned for the maximum term pre
scribed for the offense of battery. Fur
thermore, since, filing her complaint she
had reviewed his behavior \u25a0. for several
months prior thereto, and the more she
revolved it;, in her mind the more thor
oughly ' did she . become . convinced \ that
some female person had supplanted her
In his affection. So It was useless for the
court. to suggest a kissing and making up.
.Mr. 'Ferguson mildly requested permis;
sion : to tell his side of the story, and the
request was graciously, complied with.
His wife, he said, had omitted^ from her
narrative several details that might have
served to make his conduct lees rdprd
herisible than \u25a0 she had- made it*' appear.
After she had slashed i at.- him .with -a
knife, and struck his head with a lump of
coal ; he began . to suspect | she -, was I angry,
and. that suspicion was confirmed V.when
she attacked him withY a razor. , 'ln ! . the
act of disarming her one of 'his hands
might accidentally have collided with her
jaw, v but .the â¢ accusation ,that he 7deliber
ately.struck hpr was false. -V: ;' '';'?"
'Twas true, however, that he had a
penchant for, singing and that -he at
tempted to lull- the' baby to slumber by
crooning, , "Pawpah's LJ'l Punkin-Cullud
Coon." But he combated the complain
ant's . assertion that his - vocal j effort "al
most scared his offspring into convulsions.
It would 'be difficult' to shake : his belief
that the infant was surreptitiously; pinch
ed'by "Its maternal . relative with the^ ob
ject of making it weep and thus i provide
her with excuse for assailing: him. >
In response . to a query from the bench
as to how she would support; herself and
the baby If Mr. /Ferguson were , sent ?to
jail, Mrs. Ferguson! replied; that as she
had independently, maintained her house
hold for several months she faced without
trepidation " the prospect of his imprison
ment. :\* v . : V \u25a0>\u0084\u25a0'\u25a0.. v .\u25a0\u25a0;. .'.:-\u25a0.

Out Some Rent Money by
a Little Jewelry Deal
Willus Britt, who is supposed Tto have
De Witte and other diplomats skinned a
block, has been bunkoed just as though
he were a simple egg-planter from. Peta:
luma." ; Willus was -what \is - termed the
"fall guy" for the simplest bunk that was
ever sprung. \u25a0-\ â¢ 1
He bought a glass ; diamond. He paid
512 50 mv real "money for it, too. That's
where it stings. " \u25a0 -. .. -.-
It happened Thursday." \u25a0 Willus \ was out
with Brother J.- Edward mapping out' a
new , set of flats when tne "sucker" hove
in sight.' He 'looked easy t* Willus. His
growth of .whiskers was luxuriant and he
was as verdant as the decorations - for
St Patrick's day. ;
"I want the low down on this fight,"
quoth the verdant one. ; "Just give me the
tip and this is yours."
The agriculturist exhibited to Willus a
diamond that blinded- beholders with its
brilliancy. ;
"What will you take to separate your
self, from I it?" asked Willus.
S "Give \u25a0me $12 50 and you can f reeae on
to the \u25a0 sparkler," .replied the unsophisti
cated one. :. . _ . -'..-:\u25a0',
Willus went aowninto Brother Jimmy's
rent money. He paid the farmer and, it
is said, gave him the "low. down."
\u25a0The farmer faded away, and Willus dec
orated himself with the window pane. He
flashed the brilliancy in the faces of some
of his friends, one of whom was Finnus
the Hackus. â¢: .
Finnus saw the diamond and smiled
one of those far-off pitiful smiles. '/
Willus fondled the jewelry and looked
anxious. He took it to a jeweler to have
it autopsied. ,
"No better glass in the market," said

APPEARS PROUD
OF NORORIETY
William Ellis, Alias Sampson,
Suspected Footpad, Boasts
of What He Intends Doing
HAS SAN JOSE RECORD
Police There Believe He and
a Companion Perpetrated
Several Daring Hold-Tips
The police investigation into the record
of | William Ellis, alias Sampson. 5 sus
pected of attempting -to hold .up Harry
Foley in Golden Gate Park on Tuesday
night, is developing facts showing that
Ellis is a desperate character. This is
not. the first time that he has been under
arrest on suspicion of being a footpad.
Detectives Bailey and Cody discovered
yesterday that Ellis and Albert Drunkle
were arrested in San Jose on the morn
ing of March 1 by Policemen Black and
Hughes, who had been detailed in plain
clothes to catch the 3 footpads who had
been holding up people for some weeks.
On the morning in question the ' Officers
saw Ellis and Drunkle standing on the
1 corner of Julian and San Pedro streets.
When they approached Â«Ellls drew a re
volver, but Black quickly closed in on
him and Ellis threw the weapon away
and meekly surrendered. Drunkle sur
rendered without a struggle. A revolver
and some cartridges were found [in his
pockets and later. Ellis' revolver was re
covered. Ellis and Drunkle answered the
description of two \u25a0; men who had at
tempted an hour or so previously to hold
up Mr. and Mrs."~3oseph Mitchell while
they were driving in an automobile on
the Alameda road. As neither Ellis nor
Drunkle could be positively identified by
any of the victims they were discharged
by. order of Judge Davlaon. Their photo
graphs were published in the San Jose
Mercury at that time. .
The detectives also discovered yesterday
that Bills had been dishonorably dis
charged from the army. He enlisted dur
ing the Spanish-American war. It was
proved that he had been stealing from his
comrades and after serving a term on
Alcatraz Island he was dishonorably dis
charged.
Ellis did not deny that be had been ar
rested in San Jose, but laughingly #aid
they could not prove anything against
him. He made this significant remark:
"When I get out of this scrape I will get
a first-class man and we will go in for
big game, such as banks and other
moneyed Institutions."
The detectives have about concluded
their investigations, | and Captain Rey
nolds', acting for the captain of. detectives,
believes that he will have a complete case
of circumstantial evidence against Ellis
and his wife. It was learned yesterday
that a woman with a.cnlld in a buggy
was seen driving around the park for
some minutes after the shooting and the
police say it was Mrs. Ellis searching for
her; husband. It Is known that they did
not drive home till after 11 o'clock. Both"
Ellis and his wife said that after Ellis
was shot they drove straight home, but
this would not have required more than
an , hour. It was about midnight when
Mrs. Ellis left the buggy in front of the
Golden Gate Stables.

HAEPS M, CONSPIRACY
Complains That Withdrawal
From His Bond Was Result
of Political Combination
Frank A. . Maestretti, president of tbÂ«

day against the Aetna Indemnity Com
pany, which withdrew from his bond re
cently, for $250,000 damages for breach of
contract. Attorney Robert H. Country
man, who defended ballot-box stuff er
Charles "Wyman. Maestrettl's ; lntlmata
friend, is the attorney of record. Maes
tretti has also filed a suit asalnst M. H.
de Young for $375,000 damages for a\r
leged libel. J
Maestretti complains that the action of
, the Aetna Indemnity Company was a po
litical . conspiracy concocted by "certain
persons." Following is the wording of thÂ«
complaint in part:
"That the said willful breach of con
tract on the part of the said : def Â»nd
ants was wicked and malicious and don*
for the purpose of injuriously affectin*
the candidacy of the plaintiff as a dele
pate to the Republican Convention, and
to enable reports to be spread and mad*
that this plaintiff as a member of thÂ«
Board of Public Works was an undesir
able risk for any surety company.
"That the said withdrawal of the said
defendant was made in bad faith and
without any cause of reason except thÂ«
determination to maliciously injure this
plaintiff and to assist in carrying out cer
tain political plans of certain persons po
litically opposed to the candidacy of thia
plaintiff and to his retention as a mem
ber of the Board of Public Works."
