SEATTLE, March 4.â The complete

thirty-eight feet in the earth -when
found and it necessitated the use of
a steam thawing plant to unearth the
Immense animal. The hair and the
skin of the beast are in a perfect state
of preservation,- although the flesh Is
somewhat decomposed, and the big
tusks, which remained fastened to the
skull, are in good condition. It is said
the skeleton is worth about $50,000, as
there are but one or two of them In
existence in this condition. Three men
â Herson, Swason and Herter â discov
ered the mastodon. It was buried In

LOS ANGELES, March 4.â Unknown
persons whose motives are known only
to themselves have been causing no
end of trouble on the Huntington elec
tric lines in various parts of this coun
ty by trying to wreck trains. Not a
division of the Huntingtca system has
been free from this menace and many
times serious wrecks have been averted
only by the timely discovery of tho
work of the would-be wreckers. Seven
separate attempts have been made in
six weeks to wreck cars upon the Long
Beach line, and while the company's
secret service department has been at
work upon the case the identity of the
culprits has not yet been discovered.
The latest effort to wreck ore of the
company's cars occurred last night near
Domlnguez. A coach left that station
at 9:15 o'clock, north bound, and near
the end of a cut In that vicinity It
struck an obstruction that nearly lifted
the car off the track. Several redwood
cross ties were found to have been
placed across the rails, and that there
was not a serious wreck is regarded
as a miracle. A few hundred yards be
yond another obstruction was found In
the shape of heavy lumber placed up
right between the rails. This, too, was
observed in time to prevent damage,
and a short distance from the second
obstruction heavy brush had been piled
upon the track.
Sheriff "White has detailed deputies
to try to discover the perpetrators
and the search for the criminals will
be continued until their Identity is dis
closed. It is probable a reward will
be offered for the apprehension of the
criminals.
Special Dispatch to TfcÂ« Call.
Hooper and Carson, according to
Taylor's version of the case, upon dose
interrogation admitted that "the gang"
might have paid some one to liberate
them. Deputy Sands, who was former
ly a guard at Folsom, believes one of
the supposed plotters to be an ex-con
vict from Folsom. One of the men
alighted at Yolo, while the other re
mained on the train until it reached
the Sacramento drawbridge. Nothing
more was seen of them. The prisoners
were incarcerated in Folsom, and Tay
lor and his deputy arrived from Folsom
last night. Taylor went to Oakland to
day to learn of the source of the
agent's information, but savB he gained
no tangible clew.
The Etory as Sheriff Taylor gives it is
as follows: He and Deputy George
Sands left San Rafael at 3:45 o'clock
Tuesday afternoon. They left San
Francisco for Sacramento at 6 p. m.
Upon leaving the Oakland mole the
train conductor sought out Sheriff Tay
lor and informed him that the agent at
the Sixteenth street station, Oakland,
had notified him to warn officers having
two men in custody that two of the
pals of the prisoners would board the
Sacramento train at Sixteenth street
prepared to liberate their comrades.
When The train reached the Sixteenth
street station two men boarded it, and
they were pointed out to Sheriff Taylor
as the ones who were to carry out the
plot. The Sheriff and his deputy were
particularly vigilant thereafter. During
the trip up the men supposed to be in
the plot passed up and down the aisle
five times, on each occasion close to
gether. On the first two occasions the
officers kept their weapons concealed,
but ur>on the trip being repeated for
the third time they drew their revolvers
ar.d kept them drawn during the bal
ance of the ride to Sacramento. The
supposed plotters, however, made no
outward demonstration, hence Sheriff
Taylor says he could not wire ahead to
have them arrested. :MfcJ&
SAN RAFAEL, March 4.â That there
was a plot to liberate Austin Hobper
and Charles Carson, the highwaymen,
from the custody of Sheriff Taylor when
en route to Folsom prison is quite evi
dent according to that officer's state
ment. Sheriff Taylor was notified of
Euch a plot, and both he and his deputy
were on the qui vive until the prisoners
were turned over to the Warden at
Folsom. The plan was to take the pris
oners away from the officers on the
train.

Grand was 39 years of age and had
no relatives here. v He left a. note to the
Coroner telling him to do whatever he
wanted with his body. One letter was
addressed to the girl, and told in en

In a memorandum book found on the
person of the deceased were several
notes written in a scrawling " hand x
Grand summed up the motive for the.
deed In these words, "Your precious ac :
quaintance has caused me my life." All
of the notes referred to a young woman
named Caroline Darling of 'the. Penlel
Mission, at 49 Third street.; Grand
spoke of his love for the girl and: said
that life without her as his wife was
no longer worth the living. , ,
One of the notes, written March 4, at
5:45 o'clock, a few minutes before the <
Austrian took his life, was addressed to"
the police. It ran as follows: ' "At "the

the inadequate Federal appropriation of
JS6.000 for the dredging of Pearl Har

Rodman has been taken. He makes
aflldavit^that the channel as dredged
according to the Federal contract and
completed is thirty-one feet deep and
over 200 feet wide, but is unsafe for
vessels of over 509 tons on account of
its tortuousness. He declares that $500,

condition equal to the necessities of
war time. To enter the present channel
cruisers would have to use their twin

The Labor Council adopted a reso

the proposition submitted by C. H.
Holt of Holt Brothers Manufacturing
Company of Stockton for a settlement
of the difficulties between that firm
and its employes.
An assessment of. 50 cents a week
was levied on Branch No. 2 of th2
Butchers' (sausage makers') Union in
aid of the striking butchers of Oak

The consolidation of the lumbermen
in Alameda has worried the building
trades councils and other labor unions
across the water, as builders. It Is said,
have been refused lumber unless thÂ«!
same is obtained from some member
of the consolidated body, which Is
known as the Lumber Dealers' Asso
ciation.
Following this, the Building Trades
Council suspended Union No. 509 from
its meeting and added a fine of $2500,
which amount must be paid before re
admission can be gained.
As a committee of peacemakers.
President P. H. McCarthy, Secretary
Tveitmoe and Treasurer McDougald
were delegated to proceed to Sacra
mento and do what they can to ter
minate the trouble existing in that
city between the union men and their
employers.
By the votes of the Expressmen's
Union and Picture Frame Workers the
proposed public street assemblage or
dinance was strenuously opposed, and
a committee appointed to wait on the
Board of Supervisors to refuse Us
passage. '.\-r
The trouble existing between the two
branches of the District Council of
Painters and Paperhangers is far from
being settled. At the meeting of the
District Council last night the stand
taken by the Russell-Brundage fac
tion was sustained. It was held that
local union No. 19 had not violated any
of the laws nor .rules of their union
governing the brotherhood, notwith
standing the action of the general ex
ecutive board.
With the view of encouraging home
manufactures and, the shipment of
their goods, the grand body of thesvi
unions will be petitioned to encourage
the passage of the Gardener shipping
bill now before Congress. The passage
of this bill will encourage the building
of vessels here-for the foreign carrying
trade.

Sixty men have been sent to the

ply sufficient for the use of the

to the Ministry, without greatly

According to a Tokio corre

The British-American Union had a
rousing meeting last night at the Acad
emy of Sciences Hall, which was
crowded to its utmost capacity. Dr.
d'Evelyn, president of, the union, pre
sided, and there was a profuse display
of the American and British flags on
the platform and from chandelier and
wall. There was also a display of the
Japanese flag in appreciation of the
promise of Kisatsuchi Koda, secretary
of the Japanese Association of Amer
ica and graduate of Stanford Univer
sity, to give some of his. Impressions
anent the cause of the conflict between
Japan and Russia.
Mr, Koda did not mince matters, but
arraigned Russia for what he termed
her duplicity, her grabbing propensi
ties and her insincere talk about main
taining the integrity of China, while at
the, same time herself laying hands on
and stoutly holding Manchuria and

make a grand dive upon her and as
similate her with .other Important
points that Russia might have the bal
ance of power in the Far East.
With emphasis Mr. Koda asked
whether It was to be Anglo-Saxon civ
ilization or Slavonic civillzatlc-n in the
Far East? Japan, he declared, stood,
firmly for Anglo-Saxon civilization.
He charged Russia with having vio
lated the promise she made to Japan
that she would go backâ that she wauld
withdraw and drop, her grip on the
territo-ry which had at last proved the
bone of bitter contention. Japan had
waited so long that at last she sur
prised Russia by blowing up a few of
her ships on one dark evening. Japan,
he said further, was fighting for her
own independence and for her own In
tegrity, and he was sure that the larga
sympathy that Japan was given by-
America and great Britain would bear
fruit in the near future.

\ aceloybone Svatli 420* ., _ '^cently it waa stated that eight battle
ships, three protected cruisere, two
armored cruisers, thirty torpedo-boats
and two coal transports would sail for
Japanese waters in June.
One of the transports, the Kamschat
ka, which carries 7000 tons of coal, will
be equipped with the largest of these
devices ever constructed. Her sister
transport also will have similar equip
ment. These two ships will carry enough
coal to supply all the vessels in the
Russian fleet without having to stop at
any port.
contemplates sending the Baltic fleet to
China seas is indicated by a rush order
just filled by an American firm for ap
paratus for coaling the warships at sea,
Thi3 is principally because the neu
trality laws will not permit her to ob
tain coal, which is contraband of war,
at various ports along the route from
the Baltic to the Far East. Russia has
been obliged to hold back the fleet of
forty-flve warships until June, when it
is believed it will be ready to make the
trip without havingto stop at any port
for coal, for then the Russian navy xvill
be better equipped than any other navy
for coaling ships at sea by means of a
marine cable, in a way similar to that
installed on the United States battle
ship Illinois when she was put in com
mission.

Isabelle Meadows. The entire fortune,
valued at nearly $200,000, was divided
among the three sons, who were to re

was to have two-fifths. A contest was

discontinued upon an agreement by
the family to allow him one-half of
his sister's share. The agreement was
repudiated and a new contest filed.
The case has been on trial several days

Sprague cannot remember where he
came from, but a railroad ticket issued
in his name shows that he came from
San Jose. The cab driver that left
Sprague at the hospital said that he
had been given instructions by a man
at the depot to take Sprague to the
hospital, and that the unknown man
had paid for the cab hire.
It later developed that Sprague waa a
street Â¦ preacher in San Jose and had
fallen down a precipice in that city.
He was taken to the Receiving Hos
pital and later granted a permit to go
to the Santa Clara Hospital.
Sprague from all appearances Is a
religious fanatic, and though he cannot
remember the name of the town he has
just left, he says that he Is about forty
miles away from home.
An aged man giving the name of
Henry Sprague was driven to the Cen

where he is being held for examination
by the Lunacy Commissioners to-day.

James E." Weaver, a traveling ac
countant for the auditing department
of the Southern Pacific Railroad, fell
unconscious yesterday afternoon at the
corner of Market and Second streets
and died a few minutes later.. The
man had been suffering from tubercu
losis for some time and death was due
to a hemorrhage.
He was placed in a cab and taken
to a near by drug store, and from
there to the Emergency Hospital. All
aid was given him. but he died soon
after his arrival.
Weaver was well known in railroad
circles. He was formerly employed in
the auditing department of the Union
Pacific Railroad at Omaha, where he
was born. On the advice of his phy
sicians he came west and secured em
ployment with the Southern Pacific
Company. Yesterday afternoon he left
the office of the company at 5 o'clock
and was on his way to the ferry to go
to his home in Oakland, when he
dropped unconscious on the street.
"Weaver was a trusted and able em

SAN JOSE, March 4.â The local the
aters must comply with the ordinance
in regard to precautions against fire.
They have been given thirty days from
to-day to make the changes by the Po
lice and Fire Commission, and if the
theaters do not comply with the law
they will be closed. This action is be
ing urged by the Federated Trades
Council of this city, which appeared be
fore the Police Commission with reso
lutions demanding that steps be taken
to protect the lives of the patrons. Fire
men must be placed on the stage to
watch for fire and see that the en
trances and exits are kept unlocked,
and the theaters must have asbestos
curtains. The fire hose at the Garden
and Victory theaters was stated to be
in very bad condition by Fire Chief
Brown. At the time of the Chicago
theater fire an investigation of the local
theaters was made and changes were
recommended, but no attention was paid
to the request of the commission. Now
the theatrical managers are given the
choice of making the changes or. clos
ing.

SAN JOSE THEATERS
MUST GIVE PROTECTION
"We must look the facts in the face
and prepare to take the consequences
6f the Japanese alliance. One of those
consequences was the activity and bit
ter hostility of Russia' and the oppor
tunity afforded to the German Em
peror to ; knock the heads of the Euro
pean.powers together and get sbme-
k thing of advantage to his nation.".;
The Spectator proceeds to warn the
press against giving Russia occasion
for picking a quarrel, especially refer
ring to the "aggressively anti-Russian
tone of the Times under the impres
sion of partisanship," which, it de
clares "it is difficult to condone or
even understand." Continuing, the
Spectator says:
"That the Times should give occa
sion to those who desire to embroil
Russia and Great Britain is rendered
more remarkable by the fact that the
Times has done much excellent; ser
vice in pointing out the trend of Ger
man policy. It is to be feared that
the harm done by the want of re
straint originally shown by the British
press cannot now be undone, but at
least our newspapers should realize
the need of not playing into the hands
of the military party in Russia or pro
viding material for those who desire
to prove to France that her ally has
been treated in an unfair and hostile
spirit by the British people. While
explosives are lying about there is al
ways need of extra care and circum r
spection."
The Spectator concludes by urging
the Government .to be vigilant and.
have its plans prepared for, all emer
gencies, sayg: . ,
"A great European war would ob
literate all traces of the Japanese war.
A popular war would cover up an un
popular one and give the Russians an
excuse to make peace or withdraw
from Japan's reach and so staunch the
bleeding in men and money now going
on in Manchuria."
Further, according to the Spectator,
military men In Russia believe the war
against Great Britain would be con
ducted in company with Germany,
whose colonies could be taken in the
event of the British" being victorious,
while, as the Russian fleet has already
gone. Great Britain could not inflict
injury to Russia."
WARNING TO THE PRESS.
Proceeding to explain why the mili
tary power should try to escape the
humiliation of a possible defeat by a
small Asiatic power, the Spectator re
marks: " .
The Spectator points out how "the
Russian feeling of resentment against
Great Britain is steadily rising, the
Russians being convinced that the
British have been the chief cause of
their difficulties by encouraging the
Japanese to go to war."
"Without considering whether there
is any truth in this view," continues
the Spectator, " the important fact is
that it is held by the Russian people
and that public opinion is in such a
state of excitement that war with
Great Britain wouM be extremely pop-t
ular."
LONDON, March 4. â The Russian
Embassador, Count Eenckendorff, who
returned from St. Petersburg, to-.day
visited King Edward and presented the
King with an autographic letter from
the Czar. This was in answer to a let
ter sent by the King, who, on hearing
that the Count intended going to St.
Petersburg, sent for the Embassador
and asked him to hand the Czar an
autograph letter, in which King Ed
ward, in the most friendly terms, em
phasized Great Britain's complete
neutrality during the war in the Far
East, and said he trusted that the
Czar would pay no attention to the
press reports intimating Great Britain
was not neutral, nor to any unfriendly
comments of the English papers, which
the King regretted.
The Spectator to-morrow will say, in
a long article on the effect of the
Russo-Japanese war on international
relations, especially relations between
Russia and Great Britain:
"We do not want to appear as alarm
ists, but -we would be doing harm, and
not good, if we tried to conceal the fact
that the present situation in regard to
foreign affairs is one of considerable
anxiety."

EXPLAINS DOCTRINES OF HIS FAITH
Exhibits Intense Feeling While Giving His Testimony Before the
Senate Committee and Declares That if the Principle of Rlura
Marriages Should Be Publicly Attacked He Would "Defend Ii
THE- SAN FRANCISCO ' CAIX, SATURDAY. .MARCH 5, 19Ui.
Smith asserted that the incident over
which the anti-Mormon !' papers had
' "I believe the practice of polygamy
was general among the; Jews at â¢ the
time the Scriptures were written," said
Smith. "I believe 'that; it wag com
manded that a Bishop should be a mar
ried man,, because, his duties* made It
necessary that he should be an expe
rienced man."
. Senator McComas took the witness in
hand to bring out whether, as the head
of the Mormon church. Smith had ever
rebuked the apostles of the church for
teaching polygamy since the manifesto
of 1S90, and Mr. Smith declared: "No
member of the church has ever taught
polygamy since that . time." ; f
"How about Apostle Grant?" ' '
Quoting from the New Testament,
Senator. Hoar said it is stated that
there "Is a command that "a bishop
shall be sober and have one wife â "
"At least one wife," Smith "inter
rupted!
"Well, we don't construe it that way
in our church." said - Senator Hoar,
amid laughter. "What I wanted to get
at is this: Now. I know several bishops
in our church who are; bachelors. Do
you regard it a divine command that
the bishops shall have one wife or
more? What -I want to know is how
you. construe that " command."' "
INTERPRETS TESTAMENT.
"I take it, then, that the question of
getting a wife's consent to marry again
might just as well be eliminated en
tirely." said Senator Beveridge.
"Just as .well," answered the v/it
ness.
Senator Overman asked Smith if he
knew whether any one of ihe â¢ six
polygamist apostles had disobeyed the
law in regard to polygamous cohabita
tion since the manifesto in 1890. Â¦
"I do not know," answered Smith. "I
only know that they were in the same
status of polygamy at the time of the
manifesto as I was myself. I do not
pry into their ? family affairs. I am
happy to say that I am not a "spot
ter" or an informer. I am not a. paid
spy." Â¦ ; Â¦c-'-rJ'^-^:
Smith answered that she would be
destroyed by the Lord, but that he was
not informed "just how the Lord would
go about it."
"Then it does not mean that the hus
band could destroy h<?r?" Senator Pet
tus asked. ?
"No, never."
Smith called for a copy of the book
of doctrine and- covenants and read a
part of the revelation which, he said,
has been accepted in the nature of
permission to take plural wives and
was not mandatory upon the members
of the church. It was set forth that if
one wanted to 'espouse a second wife
he could do so by obtaining the consent
of the first, but that if the consent of
the first was withheld he was at liberty
to proceed without it. It was set forth
also that where the first refuses con
sent t> share ncr husband wilh an uher
woman she would be "destroyed."
Senator Pettus asked the meaning of
the word "destroyed," In that sense.
"It answers as to when and where,
but not ho\v r " said Senator Foraker.
"What I want to know Is whether 'the
members of the church were compelled
to practice the polygamous marriage
and, if that is true, why It is that only
three or four per cent of the Mormons
have practiced what has been declared
to be divine command."
TAKING PLURAL WIVES.
â¢ "Does that answer your question?'
asked Smith. ....
I plane.
Taylor " asked about M. F. Cowley,
tone of the apostles, and Cowley's talks
Â»on doctrine, and in answer to ques
tions by Senator Dubois Smith said
Cowley was elected as an apostle in
3J&T. Reading from the Deseret News
of June 23, 1903, regarding a speech
"toy. Smith at the Weber Stake reunion.
Taylor asked Smith if he was correctly
reported in saying that the doctrine of
Â¦ plural marriages was a revelation by
, jGÂ«d to Joseph Smith Jr., and to reject
the men in all matters of voting, but
. thai in holding "priestly office"
* . women are not regarded on the same
'mestic and matrimonial relations of
; the high officers of the Mormon
.church, and for that reason he had fa
â¢" vored the passage of the Evans bill
'to prevent prosecution for polygam
. â¢ -ous cohabitation, unless complaints
were entered by husband or wife
frgainst each other. This bill was
paÂ£8Â«rd. but vetoed by the Governor of
-. Utah.
President Smith was called to the
. ftand by Senator Hoar at the opening
K- of the proceedings. Hoar desired
information on the subject of rights
of women In the church and whether
they hold any priestly authority. Smith
Eaid women are regarded as equals of
WASHINGTON, Marrh 4. â Interest
in the investigation before the Senate
Committee on Privileges and Elections
of the protests against Senator Fmoot
of Utah continued to-day, although
most of the time was devoted io the
introduction of documents subscribed
to as the law of the Mormon, church.
In that '"onneciion President Joseph
Smith, who wzs again on the witness
Â«tand, testified that if tho principle of
plural marriages should be attacked
it would be defended by the church.
Intense feeling was exhibited by
President Smith against individuals
.who, he said, had spi^d on the do-
"When, where and how was the in
junction in favor of polygamy received
by the church? What I want to
know is whether the practice is arbi
trary or merely permissive?"
<Smith explained that the revelation
was made to Joseph Smith'' Jr., at
Nau-jo, in 1843, but was not. publicly
proclaimed on account of the disturb
ance against Smith. It was taken to
the Salt Lake Valley in 1847, and ini
1S52 was proclaimed by Young and ac
cepted a* Â« r* vi*rioa. -rSSgggjsa^iaftaM
"I obey the law, so far as teaching is
concerned. I have not said that I have
obeyed the law in my practice. As I
have said before, I preferred to take my
chances with the law, rather than to
abandon my plural families. Polygamy
has not been taught in the church by
any of the officials. The church has
obeyed the laws, even if I have not,"
said Smith.
Reference has been made many times
of the revelation commanding plural
marriages, and Senator Hoar said that,
although the ground may" have been
covered before, he would like to have
it go on record in answer to this ques
tion:
that would be equivalent to a rejection
of God himself. Smith believed he
was correctly reported.
AVOIDS TEACHING POLYGA3IY.
Smith isaid he had avoided teaching
polygamy, but that the manifesto had
not changed his convictions on the
question of plural marriages.
Senator Hoar asked him why he
avoided practicing what he had held to
be a divine command, and the witness
answered it was because of the more
recent manifesto stopping the practice.
Senatcr Hoar persisted that according
to the witness' own statements the
practice had not been stopped, and Sen
ator Foraker interposed abruptly that
the witness had gone over that matter
fifty times and he could see no purpose
of the continued questioning along that
line. Senator Hoar resented the inter
ruption and said Senator Foraker's
statement suggested that he had asked
one question fifty times and had re
ceived fifty answers. He objected to
the inference, and when Senator For
aker arose to answer he. too, stood up.
The two Senators faced each" other in
what threatened to be a serious clash.
Senator Foraker said the Senator from
Massachusetts "could .say what he
pleased, of course! but I have not said
he asked fifty, questions."
"I accept the disclaimer from the
Senator from Ohio," responded Hoar,
but the aggressive manner in which it
was said failed to relieve the situation.
After more,; heated words Senator
Beveridge, who occupied a position di
rectly between -the- two, requested per
mission to ask a question. He said he
wanted to address "Mr. Smoot," and
lmmediately : .substituted the name
"Smith." Iq the laugh that was pro
voked both Senators, eat down and the
hearing continued. ; '> \ Â¦'.' - â¢
Senator Beveridge desired to know
whether the church considered that the
laws were being obeyed when poly
gamous cohabitation had continued
since the manifesto of 1890, and Chair
man -Burrows made the question more
personal. He said: "You have said to
day that you were obeying the laws in
not teaching polygamy since the mani
festo was promulgated. Do you think
you were obeying the law in having
eleven children from . different mothers
since that time?" <-C^-'-%^
OBEYS THE LAW IN PART.
DISTINGUISHED MEMBERS OF THE SENATE COMMITTEE ON PRIVILEGES AND ELECTIONS, WHICH IS
MAKING A THOROUGH INVESTIGATION INTO THE PROTESTS FILED AGAINST REED SMOOT OF
UTAH BEING ALLOWED TO RETAIN HIS SEAT IN THE HALLS OF CONGRESS.
Reference was made to the Evans
bill, which passed the Utah Senate on
March 8. 1901, and a few days later
the House. This bill provided that no
prosecutions for polygamous cohabita
tion should ' be instituted except on
complaint of husband or wife. The bill
was vetoed by Governor Wells.
Smith had said he was in favor of the
bill and was asked why.
"Well, it was rather a personal mat
ter with me. I was one of those un
fortunates or otherwise men who had
a numerous family, and we were made
the prey of a prying individual who
was continually spying into matri
monial relations. I thought if such a
law was passed it would be a boon to
myself as well as a relief to those In a
similar position, and put an end to this
continual 'spotting' of our private af
fairs, I spoke to a few friends about
this bill, but to none of the members
of the Legislature."
Senator Hoar wanted to know what
Smith would do if the revelations con
flict with the law. "Which would you
obey?" he asked.
"With me, perhaps the revelation
would be uppermost," said Smith.
"Suppose you receive a revelation
commanding your people" to "do some
thing which would conflict with the
law of the land? Which would they
have to obey?"
"Whichever they pleased," was the
reply.' "There is no compulsion." Then
he read from one of the standards of
authority: "Let no man break the law
of the land, for he that keepeth the
laws of God hath no need to break the
laws of the land."
son to receive revelations.
Smith said that only thn prpsidpnt
could receive revelations "for the en
tire church," though every member of
the church could receive revelations for
his personal guidance, provided they
live.d worthy to receive inspirations
from God.
Smith then testified that the law
making polygamous cohabitation a
crime was passed by the Utah Terri
torial Legislature, which was over
whelmingly composed of Mormons, and
that the constitutional convention was
also composed, to a large majority, of
Mormons, so that the laws of Utah
legislating . against polygamous co
habitation really were the result of the
efforts of Mormons themselves.
FAVORED EVANS BILL,
A pamphlet on the Thatcher episode,
by Edwin G. -Woolley, was read, in
which It was said that if Thatcher per
sisted in his candidacy for the Senate
on a platform not in harmony with the
wishes of the church the logical put
come would be to cut him off from the
church. It was stated also by Woolley:
"It would be the same If any other per
son in the church should persist in run
ning for. office in contradiction of the
wishes of the church."
Smith was then taken in hand by the
defense and- questioned by Worthing
ton. Worthington called attention to
"an apparent Inconsistency" in regard
to the authority of more than one per-
THE THATCHER EPISODE.
The book on Mormonism, by Brigham
H. Roberts, was next taken up and
treated in the same manner. '
Senator Hoar, in a lengthy statement
going over the testimony that had been
introduced, said it would soon be known
whether Tayler expects to controvert
facts as set forth by Smith â that there
have been no plural marriages since
1890, but that those who had plural
wives would continue to care for them.
"I expect to. show," said Tayler, "that
many plural marriages have been sol
emnized in Utah since 1890."
"And that Mr. Smoot had knowledge
of them?" asked Beveridge.
"Whether with his knowledge I can
not say. I cannot connect Mr. Smoot's
name with every word I utter," said
Tayler. "I expect to show that these
marriages have been, consummated
among officers of the church, and that
Senator Smoot as a . member of that
hierarchy must have had knowledge of
the fact," said' Tayler.
"When this point was reached, and as
none of the Senators desired to ask
any more questions of the witness, Tay
ler was instructed to put in the va
rious documents and books which he
desired to offer as exhibits.
"What would you do if the principle
of plural marriages was publicly at
tacked?" asked Senator McComas.
"We would defend it," said Smith.
STATKS HIS POSITION.
made "such a hubbub" had been a
declaration merely that Apostle Grant

witness said, had been made by Grant
in a- private speech and he had not

The Grand Jury held a brief session
yesterday afternoon, at which some
minor complaints were heard and'mat
ters of public interest discussed. No
final action was taken.
The greater portion of. the session
was devoted to a consideration of the
methods in vogue in the police courts.
It has been repeatedly alleged that the
judges are not attending to business
and that the number of convictions is
hopelessly at variance with, the num
ber of complaints filed. The alleged
misconduct _ of... affairs at the Alms
house was also taLen up, but no wit

is practically ended and it is expected
that by next week a report will be

cialists before Marconi, but said the
Italian inventor was entitled to be
called the father of the system be
cause he had maCe it commercially
available. There was no longer any
excuse, he argued, for failure to adopt
it on all steam and sailing ships, both
ocean-going and coastwise. More than
300 maritime stations have .been ,es
lablished and many trans-Atlantic
lines have installed the apparatus on
their boats. San Francisco and its
great commercial interests cannot
longer afford, he concluded, to neglect
the great invention.

Whitehead gained access to the

Policeman McHugh made what he
considered an important capture of
two burglars yesterday morning. One
is Thomas H. Commins, a blacksmith
at 320S Mission street, and the other
William Murphy, a fireman attached
to engine 18, who is looked upon as
the champion Jumper of th depart
ment.
McHugh, In his report to the Chief
of Police, says i he saw two men act
ing suspiciously about 3 o'clock yes
terday morning on Mission street, be
tween Twenty-eighth and Twenty
ninth. . Then he saw them enter
the blacksmith shop of Thomas H.
Commins and come out in a few min
utes. He saw them walk to the butcher
shop of Charles Fritz, 3204 Mission
street, and break open the door with
a hammer and chisel. McHugh thought
it was time to act and boldly, entered
the butcher shop. He found Murphy
hiding under the stairway and prompt
ly arrested him on a charge of bur
glary. Commins was not found till
about S o'clock and he was also
charged with burglary.
The two defendants appeared before
Police Judge Conlan and after being
Instructed as to their rights the cases
were continued till Monday. About an
hour later they were both released on
$2000 bonds accepted by Judge Conlan.
Fritz, the proprietor of the butcher
shop, called upon Captain Martin yes
terday afternoon and said that Mur
phy and Commins had his permission
to enter his shop at any time to get
a supply of tallow to use on the legs
of their horses. He was satisfied they
had no felonious yitent and said he
would not prosecute them. He hinted
that whisky had much to do with their
foolish act.
Wright and Wedin for more than a
week past have occupied a room at
405 Kearny street. In attempting to
loot the room of a fellow lodger they
were discovered. First, they attempt
ed to escape by stringing a line of bed
clothes from a rear window. Wright
stood at the head of the stairs with
a drawn revolver while his companion
prepared the improvised rope, i Sud
denly they abandoned that idea of es
cape and dashed down the stairs into
Kearny street. Pursued closely by
O'Brien and the policemen, they sought
the shelter of the Astor House, where
Wright made a losing fight for f reedom;
even to the point of attempted mur
der. >
Wright was sullen and combative
after he had been .Â¦ overpowered, and
Wedin was smilingly, â¢non-committai.
Both denied knowing one another, but
in Wright's possession was found a
photograph of the two men, taken to
gether last September.
After the two men had been taken
to the Central station, Detective Jerry
Dinan and Policemen McShane, McGee
and Groat made a search of ; the bur
glar's room and discovered " nineteen
waistcoats, fourteen coats, seven pairs
of trousers and a bolt of cloth, ' all of
Baffled in his original intention,
Wright turned his gun on O'Brien and
sought in every way to take his life.
He managed to explode the weapon
once, the bullet taking effect in
O'Brien's leg. Notwithstanding the
wound the reporter continued to strug
gle with the burglar and finally suc
ceeded in wresting the revolver from
Wright,' but not before he had checked
the fall of the hammer with his finger
and received a painful bruise.
Policeman Keohane came to O'Brien's
assistance as quickly as possible, but
the fighting was in such close quarters
that it was impossible to rescue the re T
porter from his peril until'the weapon
had been wrested from Wright and. he
was powerless to do further harm."..
Keohane grabbed Wedin, the other
burglar, and threw him downstairs into
the waiting arms of Policeman O'Con
nor, who was mounting in pursuit of
the thieves. O'Brien after taking the
revolver away from Wright passed it
back to Keohane and managed to hold
the thief until the policeman came to
his aid.
John D. O'Brien, a reporter for The
Call and one of the best known news
paper men of the city, narrowly es
caped a fatal wound at an early hour
yesterday morning in a chivalrous effort
to prevent a vicious thief from killing
a policeman. Fortunately the . leaden
missile missed a vital spot and only in
flicted a flesh wound in O'Brien's left
thigh.
The thief whose murderous attempt
was balked by O'Brien is known as
Charles H. Wright. In company with
another thief, who gives his name as
Robert Wedin, he attempted to burglar
ize a room at 405 Kearny street. The
lodger awoke and made an outcry suf
ficient to attract the attention of Po
liceman Daniel J. Keohane on Pine
street and Policeman O'Connor, who
rushed down from Dupont street.
O'Brien was talking to Keohane at
the corner of Pine and Kearny streets
when the outcry came. Both men saw
the two thieves bolt from the lodging
house at 405 Kearny street and rush up
Pine street. O'Brien and Keohane took
up the chase and followed the burglars
into the Astor House, a notorious resort
on Pine street. OTirien followed Keo
hane up the stairway, and in a narrow
niche off the hallway discovered the
two burglars. Wright drew a revolver,
with the evident intention of shooting
Keohane, who had missed his quarry
in the rush upstairs. The plucky re
porter grappled with the intending
murderer and wrestled with him for the
revolver.
Wednesday evening at Lyric Hall
Clan Fraser presented Dr. Ian Grant

Railway earnings reflect the most un

years in a decrease of 20 per cent in
January, net earnings representing a
decrease in gross of 5 per cent. Febru
ary returns promise to be no better. The
feeling is still that good settled weather
would help to repair the backwardness
of general business and be particularly
helpful to building and other lines of
outdoor work, in which operations are
practically at a standstill. Collections
are fair to good.
Weather conditions have checked
Eastern wholesale trade, and retail
business Is backward.
Among the industries reports indicate
activity in iron and steel and prices of
some grades of iron firmer, but the iron
ore situation is not yet settled, the coke
supply is insufficient and a soft coal

the whole. Is one of great strength,
and a record breaking acreage will go

Trade and Industry are still Irregular,
being: active in favored sections, but
hampered in others by the prolongation
of winter weather, with its concomi
tants of delayed transportation, car
shortages or floods.

the effects that characterize the rendition of the

at any moment infuse as much of his own individu-

the point of a pistol while Lane called
him all the names he could think of.
Pistrict Attorney Allen stated to
Judge Samuels that Lane was under
the influence of liquor at the time of
the incident and imagined he had not
been/given all. the pay that was due
him. Mr. Allen believed that the ends
of justice would be served if Lane
were ' allowed to go with his relative
to Cheyenne. Upon this motion the
charge was dismissed. . ,
Judge Hall in dismissing the charge
took occasion to say to Nathan that he
believed him guilty and warned him
that if such a verdict had been arrived
at the least punishment he would have
given him was three years in prison.
The Judge agreed with the District
Attorney in the belief that a jury
(vould not convict, owing to the repu
tation of the wife.

STATE DEMANDS
MORE DRAINAGE
Professor Elwood Mead Says
Adequate System Would Be
of Value to 'California
Berkeley Office San Francesco Call.
; 2148 Center street, March 4.
That the agricultural industry of
California will b3 vastly benefited if
the State is provided with an adequate
drainage system Is the belief of Pro
fessor Elwood Mead, professor of the
institutions and practice of irrigation
at the University of California. Pro
fessor Mead has just returned to Cali
fornia after a fifteen months' absence,
during which lie studied the irrigation
and drainage systems of Europe arid
the United States, and his observation
in regard to the need3 of California is
based upon his investigations else
where. In this regard he said to-day:
I am . convince d from what I. saw in Cali
fornia and elsewhere that the State la in
need of a complete drainage system. The
State has- great natural advantages, but nature
will have to be assisted, by the work of man.
I think that the work could be very well be
gun nnd profitably in the Sacramento Valley,
by whose, river . I have Just . come from the
upper country 1 . A system of drainage there
would be -'of Inestimable advantage to the
fatmers.and preserve them against the annual
losses they have to suffer.
While abroad I spent considerable time
Â«tudying the irrigation methods in use in the
valley. of the Po in Italy. I had expected to
find a country very like California In climate
and productions, but instead found that It
much more renembles the Mississippi Valley
in respect to the crops grown. There Is net
that diversity of fruits and cereals grown there
that there in in this State, nor Is the land
necrly so rroductlve. - â¢ .
I. feel now, more than ever, that California
has a great future as an agricultural State.

BERKELEY, March 4. â Caught in
the act of walking off with twenty-six
pounds of Friday's fish that didn't be
long to him, George C. Boeddiker, un
til lately a watchman at the univer
sity and more recently a student
boarding-house keeper, was arrested
on a charge of petty larceny early this
morning by Deputy Marshal George
Thompson.
In Boeddiker the local police think
they have captured the man who has
aroused to anger more housewives
than any other man in Berkeley. In
him they see the author of all the re
cent petty thefts of meats and vege
tables and- chickens and butter Vind
egjjB form kitchen meatsafes and back
door stoopp.
The whole town has suffered from
these nighttime depredations. Noth
ing left out of doors has been safe for
the last three months. Chickens that
were sent to roost at twilight disap
peared by morning. If the baker, the
butcher or candlestick-maker left any
of his wares at the rear door It was
walked off with while the family slept.
Even the pints and quarts of milk the
milkman deposited went the way of
the others.
And now the police claim to have
discovered another thingâ rthat the
tetuff all went to stock a student board
ing-house. They have ascertained
that the boarders, of whom there are
four, -who lived at Boeddiker's place. at
2011 Bancroft way lived, on the fat of
the land. Chicken/ was served three
times a day and sometimes oftener.
The choicest cuts of meat they always
had and fish was served regularly on
Fridays.
One of these boarders is Walter
Jannoy, who looks as if the boardhad
certainly^agreed.Miith ,him v Be sayj^
tie* had no ' idea * r Vhat - "lie "'was "eating
other pebple's.thlngs and ordered fr.om
the menu without feeling any qualms
of conscience. v / ." .
"We often had chicken at the table,"
he said. "In fact, we had it so often I
gotrather tired of it. Other thing3
we had in proportion and I always
went away satisfied. I will be rather
sorry, to miss the good things."'
The" other boarders are J. Robert
Hubbard, J. A. Riedler and H. E.
Gruenwalder, all of whom express re
gret at their landlord's plight. :
Boeddikef, it seems,, has been sus
pected .of : , the doorstep "thefts 'for a
long time. " Deptuy, Marshal Thompson
noticed him around town . last ' night
"and set a "watch upon him; Some
time after midnight he saw* the man 1
go to Fishers market on Shattuck ave^,
nue and take a lot of fish out of a box
standing In front of the place.' The
fish he put. into a sack and started to
walk off.
"As poon as Boeddiker saw that'll,
.was after him," the officer said to
day, "he threw the sack Into the street
and walked rapidly down Shattuck
ayenue. I thought he would try: to
escape by running, -but .he did -not,
and I soon 'overtook- him. -I ; have- no
doubt h~e is the man who has "* been
robbing people Â¦ around here lately." '.i
Boeddiker protests his . Innocence,
saying his arrest, is -the. result of a mis
understanding and '* an . ,' .officer's > ; mis*
taken zeal. At ) the : County : .Jail,;?' to
which he was taken upon failing* to'
give $300 cash ball,,he said: Â¦â¢- â¢*;>: Â£3",*
"I was on my way 'to West Berkeley'
to buy some whisky, for. my Â« wife* who
is ill. arrest is 8imply> a, mistake
that wfrl "be easily rectified."

Preacher's Death Accidental.
OAKLAND, March 4. â A Coroner's
Jury this evening , returned a verdict
of "unavoidable accident" in the case
of the Rev. William T. Beale. who was
struck by a team at Twenty-first street
and San Pablo avenue and died from
shock.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
/ 1118 Broadway, March 4'.
For hours to-day aged Frederick
Page, pistols in hand, sat barricaded
in his room at 308 San Pablo avenue,
defiant of the civil officers who were
trying- to serve a summons In a divorce
suit brought by his pretty yourfg bride,
who was Alma N. Schmltt until Janu
ary 6. Threatening to kill the first per
son that should attempt to enter the
apartment, the -angry husband held the
fort against all comers until the assist
ance "of the police was invoked this
evening through the issuance of a war
rant for Page's arrest. The complain
ant was Mrs. Page, who swore that
her spouse had threatened to kill her.
Armed with the warrant, Detectives
Quigley and Shc-rcy, flanked by Dep
uty, Sheriff Jeff Scanlan, who bore the
divorce summons, repaired to the Page
domicile. Warned that they might, ex
pect a deadly encounter, the officers
very stealthily-approached the room.
They tried the door, no response; then
with skeleton keys they gained en
trance, only to awaken the old man
from a sound slumber into which ' he
had fallen, after his arduous vigil dur
ing the day.
"What do you want?" demanded
Page.
"You; we have a warrant for your
arrest," answered the detectives.
"And here is a summons in a suit for
divorce," added Scanlan.
"Did my wife do this?" queried Page,
as he got himself together and started
off to jail.
"Well," he continued, "that's what
an old man gets for marrying a young
wife."
In default of 15000 bonds Page was
detained at the City Prison.
Page claims to be a mining man.
He said he was 52 years old, but his
appearance adds ten years easily to
that half-century mark.
There is romance In the marriage
story. Pretty Mrs. Page was an at
tendant at Ziegler's delicatessen shop
on Seventeenth street and Telegraph
avenue when she first attracted the
old man's attention. He found it con
venient to drop into the shop and
chat" with the buxom saleswoman.
And he talked about wealth and gain
ed the girl's confidence. On January 6
they were married and occupied apart
ments at 308 San Pablo avenue.^
It; was not long before the 1 young
bride had some of her illusions rudely
dispelled. Her husband told her to
day that he was threatened by a beau
tiful widow with a breach of promise
suit. This and numerous alleged acts
of cruelty are recited in- the divorce
complaint, which was prepared and
filed this afternoon. Mrs. Page had
warned her spouse of the notion she
intended to take, hence the old man's
preparations to withstand a possible
siege. But Morpheus won him from
Mars and the prosaic policeman cap
tured the sleeping husband.

Every meat market in this city was
open and doing business to-day, de
spite the lockout of the Butchers'
Union. In the non-union shops, which
number all but four markets, the em
ployers were hard at work with such
help as they have been able to pick up
since yesterday morning. 'The quartet
of union shops were also busy and the
proprietors who have declined to joip
the bosses' association say they can
hold out and supply their customers.
The employers have framed plans
for a campaign of Indefinite length, and
one of their first moves was to send
delegations of bosses to work at Fred
Becker's big markets on Washington
street and on Thirteenth street, which
has apparently been selected as the
storm center of the contest. Here were
a dozen employers working behind the
blocks alongside of non-union men who
had been given the places of the
locked-out union butchers. This plan
of assisting Becker will be continued,
each member of the Employers' Asso
ciation taking his turn. The same sys
tem will be followed in all other shops
where considerable assistance â¢ may b"e
required pending a settlement of the
difficulty.
In the smaller shops, where the em
ployers do much of the cutting, the
pressure from the lock-out is not so
severely felt. Many of them have been
compelled to stop delivering meat, but
they say the people will be forced to
go to the shops for a time and carry
home their orders themselves.
On neither side was there a new
phase of the struggle. . Possibilities arc
discussed as to the injection of outside
unions in the affair. About the labor
headquarters rumor was current that
the restaurants and hotels might be
affected by a sympathetic strike of
cooks and waiters. At this time none
of the union representatives are -will
ing to commit themselves on this sub
'ject.
From the Batchers' Union to-day
was. given out a statement by J. E.
McGovern, the, business agent, that the
union wag prepared to make a long
fight and would be given all of the as
sistance it required, both financially
and morally. McGovern added:
This is a flsht to save the Integrity of the
union. The employers have tfaid lh*y would
hot recognize the union and they' have- locked
out their men because they have stood by the
union. We are not really able to say what
form our efforts to win will take. I feel 'sat
isfied we can w'n.
On the other hand, Fred Becker said
The employers have organized with a deter
mination to t*ttlefor good whether we shall
be permitted to carry on our own businesses
as we think is best. We will not sign any
agreement with the union. That is final. The
men can be members of all the unions they
want to. but when they do business with us
It must be as Individuals. This talk about
wages and hours Is nonsense. I am paying:
the union rates, and so Is nearly every other
butcher. ,
.Both the wholesalers and retailers
declare that there will be no meat fam
ine. Irving C. Lewis of Grayson-Owen
Company said that the public would
be supplied even If the retailers were
compelled to close their shops. The
tenor of comment on the subject from
the employers' side was to indicate
that the possible contingencies of the
struggle had been carefully studied and
would be met.
â¢ The union shops claim to have suffi
cient, supplies to run them through un
til Monday. The proprietors assert
their ability to get meat no matter
what action may be taken by the
wholesalers. Robert Vincent, one of
the union shopkeepers, insisted that he
could keep his stock up from several
sources if the ordinary -supply should
fall.
Among the locked out butchers Is
former Mayor John L. Davle. Davie
Joined the union before he went back
to the meat block, his old trade, and
was among. the employes at Becker's
that went out.
The. San Francisco Butchers' Board
of Trade, through its secretary, John
M. Gilbert, declares. that the organiza
tion is not in any way interested in the
Oakland trouble.
North Berkeley Improvement Club
Authorizes Its President to Appoint
a Campaign Committee.
BERKELEY, March 4. â The North
Berkeley Improvement Club took the
first steps toward advertising the pro
posed, bond issue last night when it
authorized Victor Robinson, the presi
dent, to appoint a committee of three

North Berkeley.
. Besides arranging for these meet
ings the committee will seek to interest
the other improvement clubs in the
city in the bond* and prevail upon
them to use their influence in favor
of them. Addresses were made by E.
B. Newton, Lto Hampton; F. W- Rich

that the bonds are needed.

The Board of Park Commissioners in
regular meeting yesterday afternoon at
the office of the president, A. B. Spreck
els, declared in favor of 'beginning work
as early as possible on the proposed
circular speed track which will inclose
a polo field and athletic grounds in
Golden Gate Park. It was the sense
of , the board that $25,000 of the park
allowance might be expended in the
enterprise, provided representatives of
the polo clubs and athletic associations
would contribute an equal sum. -
A. B. Spreckels headed the list of
outside donations with a contribution
of $1000. The l!st is now open for sign
ers, and it is expected that prominent
men belonging to athletic, turf and
polo clubs who have been urging the
commission to go forward with the
work will sign up at once.
Commissioners Reuben H. Lloyd, A.
Altman and W. J. Dingee freely ex
pressed their sentiments to a delega
tion that waited on the board yester
day. J. L. Borden was the spokesman
for a delegation consisting of William
J. Simpson, E. J. Lynch, James Mc-
Tighe, E. R. Pease and T. J. Crowley.
All parties agreed that the site Should
be the ground' south and west of
Spreckels Lake, between the present
speedway and the north drive.
Superintendent McLaren estimated
that the work proposed would cost $50,
000. He estimated that the loam would
cost $16,000. It was figured that 80,000
cubic yards of sand would have to be
moved. Mr. Borden, speaking for the
horsemen and the athletes, drew a
beautiful picture of that region of the
park a,s it would appear when the- track
was completed and the adjacent area
adorned with trees, terraces and
grasses. Commissioners Lloyd, Spreck
els, Altman and Dingee tldmired the
picture. They explained, however, that
only a small percentage of the annual
park allowance could be applied to new
work, as the expense of maintenance
very nearly equaled the amount al
lowed for all purposes.
VALUABLE ART SPECIMENS.
It was announced to the board by
Mr. Lloyd that Mrs. Sarah M. Spooner
had given to the Memorial Museum
in the park tapestries, laces and rare
paintings of great value. The Spooner
contribution embraces a thousand ar
ticles. Mrs. Spooner left the city yes
terday for Pacific Grove and will short
ly proceed to her home in Boston. Be
fore her departure from San Francisco
she executed documents providing that
the park should have ftiture ownership
of many rare specimens of art. A reso
lution of thanks to the lady was unani
mously adopted by the board.
The commission -awarded to M. Ear.I
Cummlngs a contract for building a
drinking fountain on the terrace in
front of the conservatory. Golden Gate
Park. The design submitted by Mr.
Cumraings was accepted at a previous
meeting, and his bid, on open compe
tition, to build the fountain for $2500
was accepted yesterday.
The Commissioners decided to plant
a row of trees adjacent to the sidewalk
all around Lobos Square. Permission
for 'such tree-planting was obtained
from the Board of Public Works on ap
plication ot Mr. Lloyd. The area of
the park is twelve acres, bounded by
Chestnut, Bay, Laguna and Webster
streets. The secretary was directed to
inform City Attorney Long that there
were squatters on Franklin Square,
near Sixteenth and Bryant streets. The
commission proposes to improve the
square, and desires the ejectment of
persrns having no right on the prem
ises. It was remarked "that the Spring
Valley Water Company claimed 100
feet of Franklin Square.
The superintendent reported that the
working forces on parks and squares
during the month of February num
bered 295 men.
The Children's Playground for the
month of February was maintained at
a loss of $5S2 5y The loss at the Japan
ese Tea Garden was $93 40. Rainy Sat
urdays and Sundays in February ac
counted for the falling off in receipts.
KMULKAIS FOR TEMPLARS.
John P. Fraser, in behalf of the deco
ration committee, Knights Templar
conclave, requested that Templar and
Masonic emblems should be laid out
and planted in Golden Gate Park. It
was agreed that Commissioner Lloyd
should supply the emblems.. The su
perintendent will direct the planting.
Professor Grueber recently gave to
the park a rare animal, known as a
monkey-bear, or "coochy-coochy." It
was captured in a forest of Venezuela.
It answers to the name of "Castro."
Mrs. Millmore, matron of the Chil
dren's Playground, . is taking care of
"Castro." The Commissioners yester
day instructed the superintendent to
provide a cage for the newcomer. The
pedigree of Castro is in French. Ac
cording to the translation of Commis
sioner Altman, the animal is naturally
dangerous and becomes ferocious at the
sight of blood. According to the trans
lation of Secretary de Succa, "Castro"
is as gentle as a cat. The animal is
playful. His tail is long and beautiful.
His intelligence is remarkable, and the
secretary 'reports that his disposition
is agreeable.
Henry Brown of Willits, Mendocino
County! offered, by letter, to sell to the
Park ' Commissioners two sound and
healthy tame grizzly bears. The offer
was referred to the Chutes.
The subject of selecting a site in the
park for the proposed monument to
Hall McAllister was referred to Com
missioner Altman. The secretary was
directed to notify Judge Hunt of the
reference.
i '/'Moscow Is burning!- The worldis on
fire! '.Romeo, -go to 'the bathtub and
takeout Juliet!".
Â¦ It remains for the court to determine
whether these words, shouted in sten
torian tone's at\3:30 a. m. by a hus
band at -the door of his wife's^ room
in. a hotel, are sufficient grounds for
divorce. They- are incorporated in a
complaint filed yesterday by' Louise R.
Stack, a pretty Sacramento girl, against
Edgar H. Stack, a clerk in the auditor's
office of the Southern. Pacific Company.
Mrs. Stack alleges that they were use<l
by j her husband r on * the . morning Â«f
October 29 last year, within a few hours
after she'.became his .wife; and â¢. while
alief-was. resting peacefully in a ? room
at^ the; Golden Eagle; Hotel In Sacra
mento,-and- were accompanied' by the
rat-a-tat-tat of beer bottles on th?
door. . ' '- ' \
Â¦ BEER IN EVERY POCKET.
Â¦ ; It appears from the complaint that
the. remarkable nocturnal oration al
leged to have been made by Stack was
the first rift in, the lute .of their matri
monial happiness. A.few. honrj befcre
the' speech was delivered, says Mrs.
Stack, her husband helped himself to
$100 out of her purse,- vislte 1 several
saloons, got gloriously drunk and then,
with a beer bottle In each pocket, re
turned to the hotel." She says he awak
ened her by banging on the Voor with
one of the bottles. He- then. frightened
her almost to death by shouting at the
top of 'his voice that theworM was c-n
fire,' that 'Moscow was also ablaze ami
by directing one Romeo to hasten to
the ,bathtub and. rescue Juliet. She
has nothing to say about the days that
followed up* to November 30,' when she
"gays-'ishe and her husband camVto this
city and made their home at 113 Gough
street j with | Mrs. Percival Edwart,
Stack's mother. She says she remained
there for a while and because Stack
did not pay his board bill they were
put out by his mother's husband, Per
cival Edwart. Â¦ - -
PAWNED JEWELRY.
On February 6, she says, he pawned
her diamond pin and wedding ring and
humiliated her by telling her friends
about it. Then on February 25 he told
her. he would not live with her any
lc/nger. informed her that he was going
to get a divorce and left her in indigent
circumstances and dependent upon
charity.
Suits for divorce were also filed by
Bessie Walker against Leon J. Wal
ker, Etta Gray against Henry Gray
and Emma L. Bamford against James
Bamford. Mrs. Walker alleges cruelty.
Mrs; Gray neglect and cruelty and Mrs.
Bamford desertion. A suit on i the
ground of cruelty was also filed by
Isabel S. Hamilton against John C.
Hamilton.
Decrees of divorce were granted to
Frances M. Brown from Henry M.
Brown for neglect, Cora Hoertkorn
from Charles Hoertkorn for cruelty, Jo
sephine C. Hobbs from George L. Hobbs
for desertion and Blanche Beck frcm
Max Beck for cruelty. *
George W. Hislop, who is the de
fendant in a suit for divorce brought
by Louisa K. Hislop,' and plaintiff in
arTactlon for $50,000 damages "for alien
ation of affections against Henry
Brown, ' the banker, filed an answer
yesterday to his wife's amended com
plaint. He denies that he was ever
intimate with a woman named Violette
or any other woman than his wife.

A register of the mining industry of
Butte County has just been Issued by
State Mineralogist Aubury. One state
ment that it contains in the introduc
tory matter will attract attention
v. herever there are mining interests.
"There are more gold dredgers in oper
ation in the vicinity of Oroville," it
pays, "than in any other similar area
in Xortb or South America. There are
twenty-four at work and several more
in construction." The gold product of
Butte County in 1902 amounted to $916,
Â£61, and the silver value produced was
12219. There were also produced lime,
trick and mineral waters bringing the
.total value of mineral products of
Butte County for 1S02 up to $926,251.
The gold output came principally
from the auriferous gravels, but some
Qcartl rr.ir.es are operating. The county
.ha* been noted since early settlement
lor its auriferous gravel properties and
hydraulic, drift, river bed and surface
riacere. At one time placer mining was
extensively carried on in the county,
but this is now confined to ground
sluice cluing principally. Drift mining
is carried on extensively In the lava
capped districts and is producing some
pcld. There are many tracts of larrd
Fuit&ble for this class of mining that
car. be worked. Most of the hydraulic
nines in Butte County have been closed
down, but a few are working under
â¢permits issued by the California Debris
Ccrnmlssion. A few miners are follow
ing pocket mining, which has often
jrroved to be lucrative. Dredge mining
fcEB found its most extensive field in
Butte County. Some little platinum is
recovered with the gold in the dredge
mining operations. Â¦
About Sa per cent of the business of
Butte County is connected with mining.
Lumbering, fruit growing and stock
raising constitute th* remaining 65 per
cent. Some general facts are supplied
by the Mining Bureau register concern
ing the counts* which are not out of
plxic* in a publication which aims to
give to the public the facts that are of
interest to miners. The assessed valua
tion of the county for lfÂ«03 was $16,057,
765. The county extends from the Sac
ramento River on the west about fifty
cai'.es easterly. Forty per cent of the
county is volley land, composed of the
Sacramento, Feather and Butte Creek
valleys. The elevation ranges from
ahcut seventy-five feet to â¬649 feet
above s*a level. In the operation of
mints, rnil!s and dredgers wood for gen
crating steam and water for electric
r ower are available. Most of the drift
and quartz mining is done through tun
nels and drifts giving drainage by
gravity. Timber is plentiful In the
county for fuel, lumber and mine tim
.bering. .
A LEADING INDUSTRY.
The chief mining interest naturally is
attached to the dredging operations.
Of the twenty-four plants in operation
all but one are bucket dredges. One is
a. shovel dredge. The companies en
gaged in dredge mining in the county
and the number of plants that they are
working, respectively, are as follows:
Anv-rlcan Gold Dredging Company, two;
OwSu Dredging and Exploration J^ m Pa n >;

ere etch.
Nearly all the dredging plants get
their water supply from the Feather
River. Indeed, the exceptions num
ber but six. In these six instances the
water supply is furnished by the
Palermo Land and Water Company.
Oroville is the nearest town to all the
dredge-mining plants.
A. valuable feature of the . Butte
County register, which it shares in
common with the other county regis
ters of the same State series, is the
official information it gives concerning
the actual working of any mining
property in the county at the time of
the official compilation of mining
facts. For instance, under the head
of "Miscellaneous Mining," such re
marks as the following appear regard
ing mining claims: "Not worked for
some years"; "no development,*'
"heavy flow of water crushed pipe,
abandoned after sinking below two
holes"; "ha? produced, mill burned, not
rebuilt at the present time"; "stands
Â¦well," etc.
This sort of exact information
may be of disadvantage to mining
fakers who sell stock on false repre
sentations concerning the amount of
working progress at any property in
which they have inviud the public to
invest, but the legitimate mine oper
ator has nothing to complain about
when these facts are made public. His
situation is made stronger.
The State Mineralogist has an ex
planatory note in his register to the
effect that some mines were shut down
Â¦^ hen the field assistant of the State
Mining Bureau visited them and he
was therefore unable to obtain any
data concerning them. For every
established claim the name of the
owner or other person designated as
the proper one to give Information is
published, with postofBce address.
PARENT OF DREDGERS.
. Some interest in this connection at
taches to the gold dredging conditions
in New Zealand, where the dredge
mining industry had its origin. Ac
cording to the best available returns
the New Zealand dredgers recovered
a' total of 87,130 ounces of gold In
1S03, with an average of sixty dredgers
at work at Otago and Southland. The
same district in 1902 produced by
dredgers 103.369 ounces. In the West
Coast district an average of twenty
dredgers in 1903 produced 30,619
ounces, as against 30,000 ounces in
round figures. for the year preceding.
The Otagra Times says of the condi
tions under which the dredgers in New
Zealand were worked:
During alir^t the whole of the winter
merit hs tlie river fluctuated so much that
lUtndy dredging was difficult tn the Molyneur
River, and for a period of several weeks In
July and August, aiter the heavy fall of snow,
the cold was so intense that operations were
almost completely et a standstill. The *orgÂ«
dredgers had a hard year, and were only able
to work intermittently, with thÂ« result that
a considerable portion of the actual working
time vas occupied in treating the traveling
flrtrt. This, combined with the heavy cost of
ccalinj, has made working very expensive. A
number of companiis worked out their ground
*n<l closed up during 19C3; but. on the other
har.u. a few new cnes were floated, the most
attention in tbia connection being devoted to
the Walkaia. and Upper Clutha districts.
The Badgrer mine at Grass Valley
has. been taken under option by U. P.
Koenig. It has not been operated for
many years.
The Rawhide mine in Placer Coun
ty, near Shady Run, has been bought
by H. W. Morris of San Francisco.
The report is that the price was $80,
000.
Work has been resumed at the High
Peak mines near Julian. San Diego
County.
The Xevada County Miner says
that the Gold Tunnel mines are ex
pected to resume. A second payment
has been made to the laborers on the
Gold Tunnel, Potosi-Orleans and Erie-
Ontario mines by W. W. Vick.
j The Keystone mine at Old Diggings,
Shasta County, has been sold by Ed
White to the Broda Mining and Smelt
ing Company of New York. The pur
chase price is reported to be $40,000.
The Redding Free Press says that a
smelting .plant will be erected. The
Keystone embraces eight claims. It
adjoins the Texas mine on the north
east.
REPORTS A CAXARD.
The Manvel correspondent of the
Redlands Pacts writes that the xeport
of strikes qX rich ore in the Search
light district is declared by mining
men to be unreliable. The paper
says:
One of the latest report* brought here by
an user.t of the clique working' up the boom
describe* an immense ledge, running as hish
â¢ f 815.O0O to the ton In gold. The agent Â«
hibited Â«=rÂ«cimens o r quartz In support of his
story. The Â«amples were almost pure gold,
but cot exactly of the rock formation found
in th? extension. Wild reports which ha\e
Kcne out concerning the strike have brought
se\era! prospectors and '"greenhorns" to tha
locality, many of them having spent their last
dc'.Iir to s*t here, ar.d in many Instances they
fcBXe become a charge on the district, a Â«w
o' them being invalids, who have staked their
all on the one vain hope of striking It rich.
It can be positively stated that there has been
no rich strike, and the rock formation of the
new extension does cot warrant the hope that
there will be any in that vicinity.
All the accumulated tailings and
debris in the streams in Siskiyou
County, says the Treka Journal, have
been swept away by the freshets,
leaving the miners a clear field for
active operations, but many claims
have been filled ui> and dams washed
away.
The Siskiyou News estimates the
output of the Salmon River district
in Siskiyou Counts* since I860 at J6,
250.000.
Operations on the World Beater
group of mines at Ballarat have been
begun.
The Los Angeles Mining Review
publishes under the caption of "Les
sons in Mining" the following concern
ing the great stamp aggregation for
the Homestake mines in South Da
kota, in which Mrs. Phebe Hearst is
interested.
Â¦ The Treadwell mines of Alaska have hitherto
enjoyed th- distinction of having the largett
ftair.p mi'.l in th* world, but the mines will
soon be shorn of their honors. The HomestaUe
iXmpany of South Dakota, of which Mrs.
Pfccb* Hearst ts the principal owner. Is so
lnjr to increase the capacity of its mill, or
mill*, to 1000 stamps, giving it seventy more
Ftarr.pa than are In operation at the TreadweiL
A* is well known the ores of both companies
are low erade, very low grade, yet they arc
two r>f the best dividend-paying gold mines in
the United States. Tou aÂ«k why? Because
those in 'Â¦harce of the mines have studied
thÂ« problem before them with mathematical
precision; they have employed capable mining
Â«>r.sineÂ«TÂ« to determine the possible limits of
the ore bodies; they have employed the most
skillful mining experts and chemists to de
termine the values In the ores and how these
values can be the most economically extracted:
they have, in other words, proceeded along
strict business lines, and Instead of making a
failure they have made b. success, as would
all other men proceeding on like intelligent
lines.

labor, which nobles, the lazy
people, despise, is a true national song.
It is : neither genteel nor vulgar, but

THE SMOOT CASE.
C. W. Campbell. British Consul in

ing report on a journey made by him
in Mongolia, giving a remarkably in
structive account of the mode, of life
in the interior of China. One /very
peculiar custom is noted. 11 r. Camp
bell tells us that he was particularly
struck by the numbers of pairs of
boots hung in separate wooden cages
in the archway of the main west gate
of Hsuanhua, the valedictory gifts of
beneficent prefects. It is an attractive
custom in China to invite a departing
magistrate whose rule has been pop

Charles, Mart vr.
The Westminster .Gazette of London
in its issue of January 30 recalls an
old superstition concerning the relics
of the first Charles of England. It
says:
"To-day is the anniversary of the
execution of King Charles I. The
shirt worn by him on the scaffold, his
watch, his white silk breeches and
the sheet thrown over" the body after
the execution have been preserved
and are to be seen at Ashburnham
Place, the seat of the Earl of Ash
burnham, into whose family they
came into possession on the death of
the "monarch. The relics were once
looked upon as cures, as recently as
1860 a sick person being brought to
Ashburnham in order that he might
get some benefit by touching them."

sections, the southeastern and western.
The former comprises the Russians.
Bulgarians. Sero-Crotians and Slovens;
the latter the Poles. Bohemians. Mora
vians, Sberaks. Wendts, etc. From the
fact that the Russians are included in
this category is the reason that they
are designated as Slavs. Tatar or Tar
tar in the Middle Ages was the name
given the hosts of Mongol. Turk and
Tatar warriors who swept over Asia
under the leadership of Jenghig Kahn.
The name was afterward applied to the
descendants of these hosts, now inhab
iting the steppes of Russia in Europe.

intermixture of Frunlsh and Samoyetic
blood) and the Caucasus, such as the
Kazen Tatars (the remnants of the
Kiptchaks. or "Golden Horde"), the
Crimlc Tatars in the Crimea, the Kalu
nicks or Eleuths (who are properly
Mongols), etc. It is by reason of this
that Russians are sometimes called
Tartars.

I One of the party, John Griffiths, a
brakeman on the Southern Pacific,
startled them somewhat by quietly re
marking: "I have been a smoker ever
since I was in my teens and to that
fact I owe my life."
He was pressed for an explanation.
"I was brakeman on a freight train
not long ago," said he, "and as the
train pulled out of Truckee I jumped
on the cab of the engine to have a chat
with the engineer and fireman. When
we were bowling along at a good speed
I put my hand in my coat pocket to
get a cigarette, as I wanted to smoke,
but discovered that I had left the
package in my vest pocket in the ca
boose. I climbed over the cars till I
reached the caboose. Just then I was
thrown off my feet and after I had
gathered myself up I jumped out of
the caboose and ran forward. The
engine had been derailed and the engi
neer and fireman killed. If it had not
been for my craving for a smoke I
would have been In the cab and no
doubt would have met the same fate.
That's why I say tobacco saved my

SAN JOSE TAKES THE PALM.
AS an advanced missionary for the palm as a street
tree, The Call desires to commend the people of
San Jose, for the use they made of Arbor day.
On the suburban avenue leading to Alum Rock Park
they, used elms and the Monterey pine. But around the
school buildings, in Naglee Park and on the streets palms
were, planted. In the future there will be shown in the
East pictures of San Jose in the winter months that
will present a tropical aspect. . . . ,
San Jose is becoming more and more a resort for
tourists. An excellent hotel there has helped to bring
the town into prominence, and Lick Observatory has
drawn further attention to it. Now its palm
liried streets will add to its many gifts and
graces, which are a lure to travelers. It had
always the finest material advantages. It is the
center of the prune industry, which has* made conquest of
the American market and already is a factor in Europe.
It is also the greatest seat of the field and garden seed
interest in the country, and has a strong hold in all
forms of fruit production. The coast line of the South
ern Pacific has put it on an overland through route, and
its prospects are as bright as can be boasted by any
town on the ccast.
The determination of the San Joseans to make the
be*t use of the climate by making of their town a palm
city is a keenly practical matter. It will increase tourist
travel, and travelers who go to enjoy the resulting grace
and beauty will look- through and beyond the palms to
the material advantages of the region and will buy
home? and rural lands and become residents. It is
Â£> : mpi. anpther use made of climate as an asset, and a
mojl important use. No California town can afford to do
otherwise.
, The same principle applies to country property. If an
owner wish to sell a country ranch he should !>egin
by surrounding his ranch house with palms and orange
and fig trees. It is known that in the market men buy
with their eyes. Given two lots of fruit, of equal quality,
but one artistically . displayed, while the other is a
slovenly jumble, and the one well arranged to attract
the eye will find 'a buyer, while the other goes without.
So. it is with cities and ranches. As we have the advan
tage of a climate in which such ornamentation is easy
and cheap, its neglect is an improvidence that cannot be
excused.
We again preach ' the palm to the cities of the plain
and the coast. All palms are good and quick growers
and they are ornamental from the moment they are
planted." San Jose has done well. Now let Oakland and
all 'cities do as well, and California will get fame not
only,"as*the Golden but as. the Oriental State.
His Retraction.
The campaign had gone wrong, as
usual, for the editor of a struggling
Republican paper in a Southern Cali
fornia town. To make matters worse,
the Democrats, as is customary with
the victors after a hot political bat
tle, held a general jubilation and par
ade. One of the features of the pro
cession was a float carrying a huge
bell, which was beaten alternately by
a negro and a white man named Joe
Jeffries. It was sounding the death
knell of the Republican party.
The morning after the parade the
Republican paper appeared with a
brief account of the procession and
stated that among other features there
was a float carrying a bell, beaten
alternately by two negroes.
Jeffries, who like the well-known
Jeffries of to-day was handy with his
fists, immediately sought out the edi
tor and threatened to scatter his re
mains over fourteen counties.
The editor, like Moses, was a meek
man and promised a retraction. It
appeared the next day as follows:
"We were in error In stating that
the bell carried in the political pro
cession was beaten by two negroes.
It was beaten by Joe Jeffries and an
other negro."
While it is yet early perhaps to determine the worth
of the various correspondents that are operating with
such disastrous consequences to the armies and navies
of Japan and Russia in the Far East it is comparatively
easy, by elimination, to determine the distinguished un
worth of some of the gentlemen of the quill. For spec
tacular prevarication the. British correspondents* have,
almost made that triumph of yellow .journalism, Douglas
Storyism, a venial sin.
Virginia Tercentenary.
Considerable interest has been
aroused in England by the proposal
to celebrate in this country the tercen
tenary of the founding of Virginia, thÂ«
historical record of the date of the
turning of the first sod on the Virginia
plantations being May 13, 1607. It was
the first British colony on the Ameri
can continent, and there is probably
no portion of the United States -where
more numerous representatives are to
be found this day of old English fami
lies, the younger sons of which came
over during the reign of King James,
in the train of Christopher Newport,
after whom so many towns and cities
have been named. It is on this ac
count that Virginia enjoys in a very
special degree the sympathy and the
good will of the English people, and
especially of the British aristocracy,
and under the circumstances the pro
ject of holding a world's fair at Nor
folk, Va., the busy and prosperous city
at the mouth of the Elizabeth River, is
likely to receive a very friendly re
sponse from the old country.

in the i>e rsonality and in the field trials
of the eorreF;v'rj(lPnt as in those of the
generals and admirals who hold the
center of the ?tcge. Almost, but not
altogether. This I.Â« an interest, of
course, that is not catered to by the
conscientious <orroepondent in the dis
charge of hi? duty. The correspondent,
intent upon his work, never puts him
srlf in the limelightâ although the busi
ness office of the newspaper sending
him to the front does sometimes, when
he is a man who has made a big repu
tation. The correspondent is too busy
throwing the limelight upon other peo-
And his task has elements of heart
breaking in ic Get one of the tribe to
talk to you after a campaign, as some
of them will talk when the mood is on,
and you v.ill perhaps be' astonished to
Ifarn that the life they lead is as peril
ous as the soldier's life, and as ardu
ous as the life of th<Â» lowest soldier in
the ranks. Thore is nothing in the '
world more arduous* than that.
To begin with, thÂ«Â» war correspondent
is not, as a rule, selected by the editor
of a great newspaper from the bright
young men of his staff and sent to the
front et a good salary and all expenses
paid as a ste;i in advance in his pro
fession and a kind of reward for faith
ful service to his newspaper. That is
sometimes done, but more often it is
not. It is not always even men who
have graduated out of the ranks of the
working newspaper men v.ho go to the
front. The element of lurk enters into
the thing largely. I have known a
small diplomat who chanced to be on
the scene at the outbreak of hostilities
to become a great war correspondent, j
I have known private soldiers- In the
ranks of the American army to gradu
ate into it. It often happens that local
correspondents of big newspapers find
their opportunity by being on the spot.
But a very large clan of the special
correspondents are those men who,
with the news instinct and some news
paper training perhaps, find them
selves at the outbreak of war with in
dependent means and a thirst for an
adventurous career. The career of
the special correspondent is adventur
ous. The man at the theater of a
great or a little war, free to go and
come as he likÂ«^s and not held in disci
pline as the soldiers? are, must meet
adventures. He cannot hel? it. Ad
ventures are always going about there
looking for a chance lo be met
.A man of thia class, ambitious to
go to the Fcene of war as the repre
sentative of a newspaper finds it not
difficult, in the beginning, to secure
credentials. If he is a man of known
rtandlng. He finds It easier the more
often he goes to the front, naturally.
Being a bright â tan, with the trained
habit of observation, his letters and
cablegrams become steadily more val
uable and presently he becomes
known as one of the guild of war cor
respondents. Then when war breaks
out editors send for him and he makes
hie own terras. The investment he
had made of his means in the first
instance becomes profitable, yielding
him a livelihood.
Still another class embraces those
men of letters who have made a rep
utation in the field of 1'terature and
who are sent out by great journals
and great syndicates and paid high
salaries because of the value of their
names attached to newspaper articles.
Rudyard Kipling, for instance, went
to the front In South Africa in this
way. John Fox Jr. is now at the
front somewhere in Asia- Richard
Harding Davis is always at the front.
These men write high class stuff, of
course. They are not the worse re
porters because they are great. And
the investment in them pays. And yet
It may happen that Pete Smith, who
began as a police reporter and did not
get much higher until a stroke of luck
came his way. will give more vivid de
tails of a battle. His name, neverthe
less, will not command so much at
tention in black letters at the top of
a page.
Every grjeat newspaper does not
send a representative to the war, al
though every great newspaper is rep
resented in every engagement. A war
Is covered, in America at least, by the
syndicate system. One great news

then arranges to sell the stories of
these men to a number of newspa

THESE are the days for making politics in Congress.
No matter what may be before either house, the
discussion runs at right angles to it and is irrele
vant.. One of the late manifestations of a desire to
make small beer politics occurred in the House, when
Scott, a Republican, endeavored to counter and parry,
by saying that Mr. Cleveland had a negro to dinner
with him while President. Mr. Gilbert of Kentucky, a
Democrat, admitted the charge and declared that it was
evidence that Mr. Cleveland is a Republican. Mr. Cleve
land, somewhat satirically, but positively, denied the
charge, whereupon the Democrats applauded very effus
ively, and Scott apologized, but . sent a shot into the
opposition by saying he had been the means of getting
for Mr. Cleveland the first applause from the minority
that had greeted his name for many year?.
It looks now as though the only issue left for the
minority in this year's campaign will be what is called
the Booker Washington dinner. As far as known the
facts about it arc that Booker Washington had gone
to the White Mouse fo promote the appointment pi an
eminent Southern Democrat tq a Federal judgeship.
The President was about to go to lunch and invited
Washington to join him, in- order that the consultation
might continue. The invitation was accepted and the
Democrat was appointed. He had been the Governor of
his State and makes an able and worthy Judge.
In tlie whole affair there was no thought of social
equality, nor any other element except the securing of
an able and fearless judicial officer. But it occurred
just as the trusts were beginning their campaign against
President Roosevelt to. punish him for his fearless en
forcement of the law. Their organs in New York took
it up and proceeded to divert attention from the trusts
to the "negro question. In this they have ever since
been ably supported by their Democratic allies.
The position of a certain class is illustrated by a story
current in Washington City. A Southern gentleman met
Booker Washington there and proceeded in a florid
way to commend him and his \<"Grk, declaring him to
be the greatest man in the United States. Washington
disclaimed such ascription, and said that he was only
a humble man who had selected his duty and was try
ing to perform it, and said that there were others by
thousands, greater and more worthy than he. "Name
one, sir," insisted the Southern gentleman. "Well," said
Washington, "President Roosevelt occurs at once as an
example." "Well," said the Southerner, "I did think
that once, but when he invited you to dinner with him,
sir, I changed my mind."
It is the opposition policy to spread abroad -the idea
that the President is unsafe, adventurous, apt to involve
the country in war, and that he ought to withdraw our
outposts, let the Philippines drop, and do a lot of things
that the President of his own motion cannot do. The
Democracy, in broad outline, is divided into two camps
that may be called, respectively, the Cleveland and
Hearst camps. One of Mr. Cleveland's most highly re
spected acts was his Venezuela message, which dropped
out of a clear sky, and was a challenge to Great Britain
to war. Has President Roosevelt, by any act or intima
tion proceeding from his administration, come as near
involving us in armed conflict? We by no means mini
mize the importance of' that message. It was truculent
to the last degree, and the remarkable fact about it is
that the services of Mr. John Hay were at once enlisted
in London to break its effect and placate English opin
ion, with the result that a peaceful solution was reached
and war was averted. While all Americans may be sure
that President Roosevelt will not permit an affront to
his country to pass unnoticed, he is as safe as Mr. Cleve
land, or any of his predecessors.
As for the other camp; in 1898, Mr. Hearst was yell
ing in large letters in his several newspapers, "Nail the
flag to the Philippines; don't plant it there â nail it." He
was warning the country that it was about to be dis
graced by President McKinle}' refusing to take the isl
ands, and he printed columns of attack on the President
on that account. Indeed, Mr. Hearst in those days,
wanted the earth and the kingdoms thereof, and seemed
likely not to be contented with mere islands. Now he
says in his own newspapers that he is. the idol of the
people and the popular choice for the Presidency; and
that President Roosevelt is unsafe!
All of this continuallj- crops out in the incompetent
discussions in Congress. The Booker Washington dirf
ner is merely the text for attacking President Roose
velt because he has appointed a 'few negroes to Federal
office. But the latest use of the dinner issue has served
to reveal the fact that Mr. Cleveland went to the Demo
cratic State, of Missouri for a negro appointee, who was
assistant City Attorney under the Pemocratic municipal
government of Kansas City, and who, he says, served in
the Federal office, to which he was confirmed by the
votes of Democratic United States Senators, "with- in
telligence ;md with efficiency." , . ,
In view of this revelation and of the further fact that
Mr. Cleveland probably appointed as many negroes as
President Roosevelt has, and for the same reason, their
intelligence and efficiency, we suggest that the minority
may as well regard the incident as closed.

to report and to whom and when. He
must give his word, on his part, to
conform to the rules of the service,
and to send nothing to his newspaper
without firm submitting it to the cen
sor, if he is with th*Â» army, or to the
captain of the ship he is assigned to
if he is with the navy.
So long as he observes this pledge
he is allowed to come and go as he
likes, within reasonable limits. He is
furnishes passes through the lines
upon application and he has a recog
nized status as a non-combatant. He
is in no danger, so long as he sticks
to his trade, of being shot if he falls
into the hinds of the enemy.
On the other hand he is in very
grave danger all the time, as will
readily be seen. If he is on board a
warship â where, as a matter of form,
he is generally assigned to staff duty,
so that he will find his place and go to
it quietly when the men are called to
quarters â he must, of course, share
the fortune of the ship when she goes
into action. If he is with a land force
he must get as close to the front as he
can. The front is where things hap
pen, and he is there to chronicle hap
penings. If there ever was a time
when a war correspondent could sit in
a hotel a thousand miles from the
scene of action and write a description
of a battle comfortably to be cabled
at his leisure, that time is not now.
The march of events is rapid. The
man who would see must be in the
middle of things.
After *a battle has been won or lost
the special correspondent must hurry
to the cable station to get his report
of the action filed, writing the report,
if he can. o-n the way. He has been
working all the time the "others were
fighting, but in reality his work only
begins in earnest when they leave off.
Whether the action he has seen be one
mile away from a telegraph office or
a thousand, whether he finds himself
facing a desert or a stormy sea, he
must spare neither steam nor money,
nor -man nor horseflesh to get into
touch with the home office. Of course,
he must not spare himself. If he did
he would soon find his managing edi
tor sparing him.
A great man may witness a great
action and write of It most vividly, and
yet see himself beaten by a 515 a week

Oazette if he be lacking in the talent to
move on the cable office at the psycho

sent of the church to become a candidate for a Senator
ship. As directly pertinent to the original inquiry this
is of more interest than the admissions of polygamy.
Ecclesiastical dictation of the political course and con
duct of citizens is insufferable under our system of
government. The church, in all forms, has its position

President Smith makes a special plea that he had
married his five wives before the church manifesto of
1890, and did not propose to degrade them by ceasing
relations, though he admitted that such course was un
lawful. It appears then that the,church sanctions that
which the state outlaws, for he continued in the con
fidence-and achieved the headship of the church, not
withstanding his violation of the laws of the state; in
a particular which h supposed to go to the very heart
of morals and good conduct. What in another is held
socially and legally to be a vice of the most serious
character is regarded by the church as virtue and its
practice is rewarded with honors.
If Senator Smoot had confined the case to his own
qualifications the only issue would have been the exer
cise of authority by the church in the political action of
its members. This would have been a most difficult mat
ter for the Senate to decide. But he chose to impinge
upon his personal position the practices of his church, in
which he is a ruler and an apostle, and it seems clear
now that the Senate will vacate his seat, unless,- the
progress of the investigation relieve him of the situation
in which President Smith's testimon3* places him. The
whole matter acquires increasing' importance and leads
public thought back to the first Republican' national plat
form, which denounced polygamy and slavery as "the
twin relics of barbarisn*," suggesting the same treat
ment of both systems by making their eradication a
matter of Federal concern.

an address by Park Commissioner
Frank J. Sullivan, who discussed Em

periods. Emmet, he declared, was the
f.ower of Irish nationality and the pa
triot's death was ascribed as a sacri

There was a lady in the case. ':'.;
Captain Cassan's affections -were cen
tered upon a young woman, who .evi
dently reciprocated? in kind until about
a week ago, when he returned from a
bay voyage to find that during his ab
sence she had married Cameron* and
none to housekeeping with him on Mis
sion street. The Jilted skipper hastened
to the domicile of the honeymooners
and created a violent* scene with Mrs.
Cameron, which resulted in his expul
sion by Mr. Cameron. Then he sought
Kplace in strong waters, but they only
accentuated his heartburning:, and a
second time he visited the home of the
Charles Cassan proudly informed all
whom it might concern In Judge Mo
gan's court that he was "master of the
scow schooner George Washington,"
but found that his announcement did
not in, the least condone the offense of
which he was accused by a common la
borer named John Cameron.
Fennuckkie Barnardo informed Judge
Mogan that he was unable to restrain
the Impetuosity of the horse he was ac
cused of driving at a ten-mile-an-hour
gait on traffic-congested Market street,
between Third and Fourth. The horse
was of rural birth and breeding, he ex
plained, and the clanging of the gongs
on street cars scared him so that he
hastened to get away from the noise.
"I can't accept your excuse," said
his Honor, "because you had no busi
ness to plunge a country horse into the
midst of a city's din without having
previously . tested the animal's ability
to withstand the racket. As you were
speeding at the rate of ten miles an
hour, I fine you $10â or Jl a mile."
Albert G. Foss and Robert O. Mc-
Vey, Eoldlers, were before Judge Fritz
on a charge of assaulting with a deadly
weapon a fisherman named A. Landari
at 12:30 o'clock yesterday morning at
Pacific and Sansome streets. Landari
testified that the two men jostled him
as he was passing them", and when he
protested McVey grabbed and held hl3
arms while Foss plunged a pocket
knife into his back, making a deep
wound. The soldiers were arrested by
Policemen Holmes and Skain. The case
was continued till next Monday.
Charles Spofford appeared in the
court of Conlan to prosecute the as
sault charge entered against Joe Mul
loney, a restaurant waiter, and the
damaged apoearance of Mr. Spof
ford's face corroborated his com
plaint. He testified that Mulloney
brought him a beefsteak so diminu
tive that he felt justified in demand
ing a larger one and that thereupon
the waiter smashed his countenance.
The case was continued.
Charles Belmont, another Â¦waiter,
was before Cabaniss on a charge of
assaulting John Kiser, chief cook in
a Montgomery-street restaurant. Ki
ser informed the court that Belmont
delivered his orders to the kitchen in
a way that was unintelligible to the
cooks and that consequently some
very annoying mistakes were made.
For instance, when a customer or
dered a rib steak Belmont entered the
culinary department and yelled "Gim
me a ribber," and when Kiser inter
preted the order as "liver" and ac
cordingly cooked liver, Belmont waxed
angry and cast a cup of hot coffee In
his face. Belmont was fined $20.

"Every morn you bring me violets,"
hummed Judge Mogan when Clerk
Gray informed him that among the
names on his morning docket were
those of Violet Carter, accused of
theft, and* Violet Johnson, charged
with vagrancy. "Where were these
Violets culled â or, I might better say
pulled?"
"On the Barbary Coast," was the
clerk's reply.
"'Ah, soil and atmosphere may ex
plain their total lack of fragrance, to
say nothing of the wilted appearance
of Miss Johnson."
Neither of the Violets was ready
for trial and both cases were contin
ued.
"You prefer to punish those who
are dependent upon you for support,
I suppose? Well,' you must provide
for them. I will continue this casa
until next Tuesday and allow you lib
erty during the interim, so that you
can either earn or borrow enough
money to provide your family with
life's necessaries. And for your own
Fake you would do well to hustle."
"Why don't you borrow enough
money to keep your wife and children
from starving until you obtain a job?'*
"I don't like to borrow."
Another instance of helpless child
hood suffering through parental nep
lect was unfolded by the testimony
apainst Bernard Hardy, a stalwart l"el
low, who had been arrested for fail
ure to provide for his invalid wife and
two little ones. He said lie had been
captain of a tugboat, but lost his po
sition because the odor of oil in the
pilot house affected his liver and in
capacitated him for work and for
some time he has been without funds
or employment.
"Why don't you try some other oc
cupation?" inquired the court. "You
appear big and strong enough to per
form any kind of manual labor."
"I can't get a job," was the reply.

Wandering aimlessly along the San
Bruno road, while the rain fell heav
ily upon them, three-year-old Olive
Fenton and her intoxicated mother
were met by a policeman night before
last He took them to the City Pris
on, where the little one was consigned
to the care of the matron and the be
draggled parent placed in a cell.
The woman was a pitiable figure as
she stood before Judge Mogan yester
day and incoherently told as much as
she wanted to tell concerning hersoif.
At first she refused to talk at all, but
Fharp questioning by the Judge elicit
ed the information that she Is the wifrÂ»
of George Fenton and dwells at 32 2 Mi
Bryant street. She either could not
or would not explain, how she and the
child had been found so far awav
from their home, nor would she dis
close where she became inebriated.
Her reticence was such that the Judge
ordered her held in custody until her
husband can be brought to court and
made to testify.
In the court of Cabaniss yesterday
the young fellow gave his name as
Martin Urich, and it was proven that
the boat in which he was caught had
beer, stolen from the schooner Cham
pion. He was sentenced to four months'
imprisonment.
Customs Officer William Harrington
was on watch last Thursday night at
the Pacific -Mail dock, when he saw a
young man in a boat whose actions
aroused his suspicion. The youth at
tempted to beard a big steamship by
climbing over her stern, when the
watchman inquired why he had adopt
ed that extraordinary means of get
ting aboard, and the answer was so
unsatisfactory that the youth was
commanded to row ashore. Instead of
obeying, however, he started rowing
with might and main for open water,
and then the watchman opened lire
at him with a revolver and the fugitive
surrendered.

From other sources, however, it was
ascertained that the attack upon Miss
Alberts was provoked in some unex
plained way by the attentions she re
ceived from the impresario of the es
tablishment, James Hallett.
, Before the case is finished there is
likely to be startling disclosures of the
unseen life behind the scenes of Mr.
Hallett's subterranean home of the
drama.
Marie Alberts, who stated that she
is an actress, was the complaining:
witness against Tillie King and Lola
Hallett, also self-alleged Thespians,
when they were conveyed before Mo
gan to answer a charge of assault and
battery. Miss Alberts deposed that so
grievous were the injuries inflicted
upon her by the defendants that she
was unable to leave her apartment for
four days. The assault, she explained,
was entirely unprovoked and took
place in the theater in which she and
her assailants were employed. When
she stated that the playhouse in ques
tion occupies a basement at Kearny
and Jackson street there was a pal
pable sagging of the interest which the
chairwarmers had manifested in the
case.

Throughout the testimony in the
case of robbery against several women
inmates of a Stockton-street room
ing-house there were so many allu
sions to one Irene that at last Judge
Mogan asked for a description of the
mysterious female. "She is a blonde
lady with a red dress," was the most
complete aid to her identification that
could be obtained.
Yet the elusive Irene was, according
to all the evidence, most active in the
robbery of a soldier named Carter
of about $40. It was sworn that Irene
drugged his beer with cigarette ashes,
stole his money as he lay in a stupor
and left him in her apartment while
she fled to parts which the police have
since been unable to discover. The
most garrulous witness was a- young
man named Charles Clealj who served
as clerk of the house, and when he
told of the solicitude with which he
attended to Carter's comfort before
and after the theft even Bailiff Hickey
was affected.
The hearing will be resumed next
Monday.
The charges against M. T. Tacanda
was pressed by Mr. and Mrs. Slmoles,
who own a water front lodging-house
with saloon attachment, and they tea-'
tifled that the defendant owed them
room rent for two months, which he
refused to pay, and that he added in
sult to injury by frequenting the sa
loons and taunting them with inability
to make him pay. A troop of ordinary
and able seamen and apprentices and
a few landlubbers corroborated the
testimony adduced by the Simoles and
the defendant had no logical excuse to
offer for his conduct. He will be sen
tenced to-day.
When the case of M. T. Tacanda
was called in Mogan's court a sturdy
young fellow emerged from the cage
with nautical swing and a number of
men in sailor togs advanced from
without the rail to the section reserved
for witnesses.
From the thriving city of Great Falls,
Mont., came W. R. Getz to inspect the
San Francisco sights, and to properly
prepare his vision for the task he im
bibed until he was Intoxicated. Then he
saw the Interior of the City Prison, and
yesterday morning he had a close view
of Judge Mogan.
. "Why, you are still drunk!" ex
claimed his Honor, as Mr. Getz vainly
tried to stand erect before the bar of
justice.
'"Tain't drink (hie) 'tish gout,"
hiccoughed the defendant. "I'm jush
full of gout."
"You're full of whisky," said the
Judge, "and you must go back to Jail
till you're sober. A good sleep and
twenty-four hours' total abstinence
from whisky is an infallible cure for
the sort of gout that you've, got."
Mr. Getz ambled from the Judicial
presence.
Camerons and uttered ' threats and
other Improper language. Again did
Cameron attempt to eject him, but this
time there was a scrimmage, in which
the punishment was about equally di
vided. , Then the husband had the old
salt arrested.
When the defendant was remanded to
custody to await further evidence in
the case he dramatically protested, and
demanded to know what . was to be
come of the George Washington while
he languished in prison. The court
wearily replied that the good scow
schooner cut no figure in the case, and
to the best of his knowledge and belief
she would be compelled to take care of
herself until her master is at liberty to
resume command.

, : B. Kortlang, a star performer of the
Sari -Francisco . County Cricket Club
last;, season, arid of the 'Pacific' Club
in-H9.62, is ini Seattle, where he is in
the employ, of ;the_- Pacific Fur Com
pany. .-'.It is. possible he will stay in
Seattle during -the, coining summer and
play with the Seattle Cricket Club. He
iserititled- to one of the^Reridle" merit
medals'ifor a-. century scored : against
the. Alameda eleven last year, and is
desirous to" have it engraved with the
w'ords, ''.Champion all-round cricketer
of California.": He thinks that he can
claim theHitle fairly; having won . first
places in the .batting and bowling av
erages | in . 1,902 anjd having taken Â¦ first
place cih s the Â¦ batting; list last season,
besides capturing far" more wickets
than any other bowler. ''-.- -. .
The fact that it rained for the
last four or five "Sundays -.has made it
difficult for the .tennis players here and
across the. bay to.h6ld'thefr scheduled
events. The committee in charge of the
AJameday County^ championships has
done well, .running, off with
surprising speed ; considering", the unfa
vorable weat,her.. Last Sunday the sin
gles event was .narrowed" down to six
men. Three of -Â¦ these" are - evenly
matched, while the others have little or
nolchance' of annexing the champion
ship. That Percy' Murdock .will be one
of the cpntestantsln the.flhals is a cer
tainty. . He meets. 1 the winner of the
OtisrAmbrose riiatch Jh the semi-flnals
and 'is sure to* beat" either of them. In
the other hal/ there.; is- much more 'un
certainty.' " Charles-' Dunlap I has ob
tained a place in the semi-finals and
will meet the -winner of the Variel-
George. Baker match. . Dunlap has not
much chance of beatfng either of these
men. He should,- however, give a good
accpunt of himself, and -If .at, his best
might win. A. great battle is expected
when Variel and Baker meet this afttr
hoon. On account' of having beaten
MacGavin last Sunday Variel is a
strong favorite. Baker is a steady
player and can always be depended
upon. Variel is a much more brilliant
player, but, like all others in this class,
has off days. If he-1s not at his best he
is liable to' be poor. Variel played the
best game he has yet shown in his
match with MacGavin. True, the latter
was not playing his best, but Variel
deserves great credit, as he has played
but little of late and was thought to
have a poor chance of beating the
lengthy crack. Baker played fine tennis
in the doubles against MacGavin and
Variel.
Now that MacGavin has been dis
posed of the most likely candidate for
championship honors is Percy Mur
dock. It was thought from the start
that the "main struggle would.be be
tween MacGavin and Murdock. The
latter has always been considered a
good first class man, but never accom
plished much until last September. He
was runner-up in the coast champion
ship singles, and made Bell, the cham
pion, play his best to win. Murdock
has always possessed beautiful strokes,
but has lacked steadiness. His drive is
a trifle wild and his overhead work not
up to the standard. If he can play any
thing like the game he put up in Sep
tember neither Baker nor Variel would
have a chance to beat him.
Murdock showed last Sunday that he
is in great form. Of course, it was ex
pected he would beat Clarence Griffin,
the young crack from the park, but no
body thought he would do it by so one
sided a score. Griffin plays good tennis,
and any one .who" beats him as easily
as Murdock did' must be a player of
championship caliber.
In doubles by far* the strongest team
on paper is MacGavih'and Variel. Be-,
fore the tournament", it was thought
that Variel would give MacGavin but
little support. Since the defeat of Mac-
Gavin at the hands of his partner their
chances of winning the doubles cham
pionship' are considered much better.
These two players should win the
doubles with little difficulty.' The Baker
brothers, considered* by 'many to be
their^ most dangerous opponents, were
disposed of on 'Sunday,- and from now
Handicap foursomes over eighteen
holes, medal play, are set down for this
afternoon on "the schedule of the San
Francisco Golf Club, partners to be
drawn for at 2:30 o'clock. The winning
couple -will receive prizss.
On Tuesday morning next, beginning
at 9:20 o'clock, a team match should
be played among the members of the
Ladies' Annex of the San Francisco
Golf Club, but there has been so much
slackness in holding ladies'- competi
tions since the beginning of the year
that the event cannot be regarded as
a certainty. â¢ Last Tuesday morning
some ladies were out on the links for
practice, but no competition was held.
The first match play round of the
handicap event, the qualifying round of
which was set down for Washington's
birthday, but was deferred until last
Saturday, was completed on Wednes
day. On Sunday R. G. Hanford and
K. D. Girvin played their match, the
former, allowing a handicap of six
strokes, winning, 4 up. The recent
drills of cavalry and artillery over the
Presidio course have scored it in every
direction, while hoof marks and tent
peg have added to the troubles
of the golfers, who, in spite of these
drawbacks, are persevering in their fa
vorite recreation. S. G. Buckbee, hand
icap 12, won 1 up from H. M. Hoyt,
scratch. Perry Eyre beat W. J. Dut
ton, who received 10 strokes, 1 up.
Polla V. "Watt and R. J. "Woods, each
of whom received a handicap of 12
strokes in the qualifying round, played
on equal terms. R. V. Watt was in ex
cellent form, winning 6 up, 5 to play.
S. L. Abbot Jr., giving 3 strokes, won
5 up, 3 to play, from Warren' Gregory,
and R. I. Bentley, receiving 4 strokes,
beat Dr. T. G. McConkey, 4 up.
The second round began on. Thursday
and must be completed by to-morrow
e ening. S. L. ALbot Jr. is paired

Just to mention the name Ormonde

lections that are dear, and he will en
tertain you with tales v>f â¢ the time
when "the. horse of. the century" left
the- fleetest of merrie England behind
him and won by himself. No doubt
exists but that Ormonde, winner of the
De'rby in 1SS6, was a mighty race horse!
and when w! OB. Macdonough pur
chased hlm.for'j^ji.OOQthe Calif ornian
achieved world wide notoriety ! in Â¦ the
turf world. In England the glory of
Ormpnde was perpetuated to an extent
by the grand, performances of hls^sori,
Orme, but since coming to this country
his get have done nothing.'- notable.
Beau Ormonde is a good but hot a
great horse," and so with the balance of
his sons and daughters.- "â¢' . Â¦.
â¢"Still, like the sound of bagpipes -to
the canny Scot, there appears '.to' ,be
romance -about' the name Ormonde,
that causes the sporting* blood "in the
veins to" tingle.' And "for this; reason
whenever an Englishman or â¢ English
woman, for that matter, visits Cali
fornia and* an' inherent love : for, the
thoroughbred exists, a pilgrimage; - is
usually made .to Ormondale, Menlo
Park, to worship at . his j shrine. On

Mrs. Langtry, the famous* English act

YACHTSMEN ARE
BUSY OUTFITTING
PLEASURE CRAFT
Yachtsmen are already busily pre
paring: for the rapidly approaching
opening of the season. The yacht
owners of the Corinthian and the Cali
fornia clubs have met and prepared
schedules of cruises and races for the
coming season. The commodore of tha
San Francisco Yacht Club will meet the
owners to-morrow afternoon In tha
clubhouse at Sausalito to discuss a pro
gramme for the year. The fleet of tha
San Francisco Yacht Club will be in
creased by the addition of the big slocp
Nellie, owned by Dr. T. L. Hill and
Vice Commodore H. H. Jenness. and of
the sloop Angela, recently purchased by
D. Moves, J. E. Gray and Frank Maino.
The sloop Surprise, formerly owned by
ex- Vice Commodore A. C. Lee, will be
sailed by Blair and Marten, her pres
ent owners, under thÂ» burgee of th-;
San Franci3co Yacht Club. The sloop
Xellie is lying in Sessions Basin, East
Oakland, where she is being put into
commission. She will be ready to hoist
sail in about two weeks.
Dr. T. L. Hill's yawl Phyllis, which
was under charter last year to Lester
Hammersmith and friends, is bein.;
overhauled at Sausalito. It is probable
that Lester Hammersmith will sail on
the sloop Edna, owned by ex-Commo
dore E. F. Sager of the Corinthian
Tacht Club, and that S. S. Marshall,
formerly commodore of the California
Yacht Club, will also be a member of
the Edna's crew. The sloop Thelma,
owned by Marshall, Foard, Thompson
and Meserole, will be let out under
charter.
Jt is said that J. R. Savory's sloop,
Juanita, has been driven up high and
dry on an old scow in the lagoon be
hind Tiburon. Frank A. Bartlett has
been visiting Tiburon every Sunday
throughout the winter and has F. E.
Baker's sloop Emilie nearly in readme.^
for the season. It is doubtful whethtr
the bridge over the entrance to the
lagoon can be raised again or not. If
it is deemed unsafe to raise it it will
be necessary for the yachtsmen to un
step the masts of their boats so as to
be able to pass under the bridge.
The California Yacht Club is nego
tiating for a location near the bay end
of the railroad wharf at Oakland, and
when it ig secured will proceed to ere;t
a" clubhouse and establish an anchor
age there. At a meeting of member*
of the California Club a schedule of
cruisers, races, clambakes and other
events arranged by. the regratta com
mittee, consisting of W. H. James. W*.
McBain and A. Vekander, was proposed
and adooted with a few changes. Sat

HOMFRAY TAKES
THE HONORS IN
WATERLOO CUP
This year's Waterloo cup has been
â¢won by E. Herbert's greyhound Hom
fray. which ran in the name of G.
rJkrlinson. The winner is by Fabu
lous Fortune-Kill Mode. The runner
up was H. T. Michels* Minchmuir,
nominated bv R- H- Whitworth. She
la by Wet Day-Kaffir Queen.
In the betting the odds against the
winner were 200 to 1, while 50 to i
could be had about the runner-up.
The stake was worth $2500 to the win
ner. With this went a $500 cup pre
sented by the Duke of Sefton. a great
coursing enthusiast.
The -winner was purchased at the
Earbican sales in February, 1903, for
525. He won a sapling stake soon
after. This year he won two courses
in one stake, three in another and was
runner-up ' in a third. In the cup
event he beat in turn "Walter Black
amoor, Prince Charming, secured a
bye through the withdrawal of West
brook and beat Loran Leader, Fetch
Fair and Minchmuir. He was led
twice during the stake, but when once
on the hare he showed great deter
mination and scored rapidly. Minch
rauir -was unfortunate in getting a se
vere trial in the semi-final, which
handicapped her.
Parcelius, the stake favorite at 85
to 20, was palpably overtrained. He
Â¦was runner-up for the stake last year.
The Waterloo purse was divided by
L. Pilkingtor.'s Priestlaw, by Mellor
Moor-Thoughtless Beauty, and A. T.
JCewbold's Mallory. by Fabulous For
tune-Slaine.
The Waterloo plate was divided by
the Duke of Leeds' lÂ»nelv Star, by
Fiery Furnace-Lopal, and L. Pilking
ton's Prince Plausible, by Boswell-
Thoughtless Beauty.
The meeting was held as usual at
Altcar. near Liverpool, on the open
field, the hares being started up by
organized beaters. The weather was
fine, the horses strong and a large
crowd watched the snort. R. A. Briee
Judged and W. Souch acted as slipper.
The Chicago Coursing Club has been
organized with Michael Allen presi
dent; Thomas McCarthy, vice presi
dent; John Hannon. secretary, and
James O'Leary. treasurer. A thirty
five acre tract has been leased at
Mount Greenwood, a suburb of Chi
cago, for three yeafrs. The grounds
are accessible by street car and by
two railroads.
Sufficient money has been sub
scribed to guarantee that coursing
trill be established on a splendid scale.
President Allen is an old-time leash
man. He has been associated for
years with John Wilson of Illinois in
the most extensive kennel of grey
hounds in the Middle West.
The owners of PhIo Alto, Rubber
Ankles, Full Moon and of other crack
greyhounds have found it impossible
to condition their dogs properly to
start for the Grand National Cham
pion stakes at Union Park k week
from to-morrow, as originally intend
ed. It has been decided to postpone
the first contest until April 3. It is
expected Palo Alto and Pocatelli will
be the first brace to start.
The management of Ingleside
Coursing Park has decided to resume
Saturday coursing to-day. The first
lound of a ninety-six dog stake will
be run, the first brace of dogs going
to the slips at 11:30 o'clock this morn-
Ing. The coursing will be resumed to
morrow at 11 o'clock. The likely win
ners look to be:

The Humboldt II was another new
model seen for the first time on Sun
day. She was built by James . Greig
of the Humboldt Evening School. She
is the larsrest boat in the club, meas
uring 79 y 2 inches over all. She showed
considerable speed in the trials, on
Sunday.
The new lake waa tried out last
Sunday for the first time since it has
had the necessary four feet of water.
Sailing accommodations were found
much better than on Stow Lake,
where the model yachting has pre
viously been done.
Many of the model boats were out
for the first time on Spreckels Lake
and the owners, one and all, declared
that the new body of water could not
be improved upon for racing pur
poses.
An impromptu trial race between
four of the best boats in the fleet fur
nished the closest and most exciting
race ever held in the park.. The
course was an 1800-foot one and the
fact that all four models finished
within a space of five foot shows how
close the finish was. The first two
boats were inches apart at the finish.
The four contending boats were the
Imp, owned by Commodore Henry
London; the Sautee, owned by L. S.
Adams; L. E. Gaudy's Zulu and, B.
Jurgens' new Zarmpa. The Imp car
ried on* the honors, but was hard
pressed by the Sautee. The Zampa
was fouled and finished last. This
new model was in fast company, but
made an excellent showing on Its
first time out.
' Many new models were in evidence
during the day. H. S. Brindle was out
with a new Brooklyn-built sloop
called the Don II. She is fifty-nine
inches^over all and resembles the
Don I, which v.-as built on such grace
ful lines. The latter boat was suc
cessful tAvo years ago on Stow k a ke
and the owner expects its successor to
prove even faster.
The members of the San Francisco
Model Yachting Club are making
great preparations for the formal
opening of the racing season on the
new Sprpckels lake in Golden Gate
Park. This most important event
among sailers of the small craft will
take plaec on some Sunday during
this month. The date has not been
fixed as yet, but the commodore has
announced that it will take place in
a couple of weeks.

SUMMARY.
It was an off day for favorites, only
one out of six getting home in front.
This was BuccJeuth in the last race,
which won handily from Dolly Weit
hoff and Emshee in the order named.
The race of the day. the Green
Meadoiv handicap, af six furlongs, fur
nished the biggest surprise. Baldwin's
Cruzados, the extreme outsider in the
betting, came from the rear in the
stretch and won by a length from
Elfin King, with Golden Rule third.
Cruzados was 15 to 1. A world of money
was lost on Golden Rule and Ocean
Dream, the latter of which ran a poor
race. Hildebrand rode three winners.
Mountain two and Booker one. On the
whole, the books had much the better
of the argument.
Weather perfect; track fast.
Judge Hamilton stated that he had
proceeded under rules 204 and 205, the
turf rules which give the judges no dis
cretion in the matter of a refusal to
obey orders, and that no middle course
was open to him, :.s the rules men
tioned specifically say "shall be -uled
off."
Redfern's refusal to ride Laureatea is
said to have been the result of a dis
agreement some time ago With the
mare's owner, J. Pelter. Pelter also
owns Chub and Redfern asked to be
allowed to ride him in his last race.
Pelter had engaged a rider, however,
and refused to give Redfern the mount.
This is said to have aroused the en
mity of Redfern Sr.
Judge Hamilton Immediately called
an officer and instructed him to take
up W. W. Redfern's badge and put
him off the track. An official ruling
was then made barring the two Red
ferns from the turf.
LOS ANGELES. Mar.ch^.-^A ; full
fledged sensation developed tQ-day at
Ascot. Jockey Arthur. Redferii. held
by many turf authorities to be^the best
lightweight rider in America,' was ruled
off the turf, together with his father,
W. W. Redfern. The offense for which
Redfern received this extreme penalty
was disobedience of the orders of the
Judges. Presiding Judge A. W. .Ham
ilton/instructed Redfern to- ride Lau
reatea in the last race of the. day and
asked him if he had any v.objections
to the horse. The jockey x^pJied that
he had not, but would "see his father,
who looks after his interests. A few
moments afterward Reklfern Sr. sent
word that Arthur would not ride Lau
reatea. Judge Hamilton issued a for
mal order to the clerk of the scales, in
structing him to put Redfern' on Uu
reatea. Redfern Sr. came to the
Judges' stand and stated that, his boy
would not ride the horse. Judge Ham
ilton called his attention to rule 204,
giving the judges the right to put any
rider they chose on a horse. Redfern
Sr. replied: "That makes no differ
ence; my boy will not ride Laureatea."
giving no excuse for his refusal.
In the field there are Hamilton,
Sweety and Wulzen, all of them fairly
reliable and likely to' remain in the
eft, center and right gardens respec
'ively. Like the rest of the team they
Â¦~re not bothered with competitors.
â¢They are a pretty good lot," Mc
'arthy Rays, "and the main thing now
s to get them to work together. We
ire going to put in the rest of the time
practicing up on team wprk. That is
ivhat is needed most" '
But on the whole McCarthy is satis
led with the prospects for* a team.
â¢ven if he isn't with the prospects for
?ood weather. He - thinks he has
)icked out the best men the college
las for the nine places. In fact, he
Joes not blame himself so much for
hat as he does the players, . who
â¢eemed to have fitted themselves in
without much fitting or changing.
For instance, Heitmuller seems to
>e about the best the college affords
n the way of a pitcher. Nobody else
rantou.h him for speed and twisters.
He is not as good as Overall by a long
way, but then Overall is good enough
for a professional team.
Then there is Bliss in the backstop's
place. Hatch was his only competitor
and he did not stay long.
It's the same way with the infield.
Iraham at first, Gillis at second,
Vdama at short and Strub at third
-re all alone in their glory.
It would perhaps be a little better
tor the team if there, were men to
strengthen one or two of these posi
tions, but there are not, so Coach Mc-
Carthy takes them for what they are
worth.
"Honest now," says McCarthy,
ain't this the hardest kind of luck?
itaining every day. Why don't it quit
?nd give us a chance? Here we've
postponed five scheduled games and
rut out practicing every day for a
Tionth. Stanford has had a snap.
Only lost one or two games. It makes
Tie sore."
nia on account of the rains that they
ntend to make the most of <?very clear
lay between now and April 2. the day
of the first game against Stanford, get
ting in as much practice as they can.
This leaves a little less than one
month for the players to develop into
i hampionship form, which is not any
where near enough, considering that
there are only three "vets" from last
fear. There were four holdover men,
t>ut Hatch. '04's catcher, has quit the
same, so that there are only Heit
muller. Bliss and Adams. With six
daces' to fill with new material and
ihe rains to look after in the bargain.

Trainer -Dad" Moulton has nothing
.at praise for the varsity track can
â¢Jdates and appears well satisfied with
his= year's prospects on the cinder path.
The men are keeping the strictest
raining rules and entering into the

o hold them back to keep them from

iofr.g particularly good work. I am
naking some shifts among the men,
hanging some frc-m the short to the
Â¦rig distances and vice versa in order

â¢Norman Dole, holder of the coast
ecord in the pole vault, is perhaps the
>est and most consistent performer
imgng the many men that are an the
iack.6quad. He has vaulted 11 feet 5
rches at this early date in the season
md promises to make a bid for the'
world's record in that event before the
eason is over. He has also entered
h? broad Jump and high jump, mak
ng 21 feet 6 inches in the former and

The varsity baseball nine is proving

Distance events are always popular,
and the Waterhouse cup, at. two miles
and a quarter, down for decision this
afternoon, should attract one of the
largest crowds of the season. Among
the starters are Our Bessie, the crack
Texas mare; game little Horton, Win
ner of. a Burn* handicap; Horatlus,
winner of last year's Seattle derby, and
Grafter, another useful performer.
Barney Schreiber will be represented
by Lacy Crawford, and Jimmy Coffey
will take a try for the rich stake wi^h
Rio Shannon. Veterano likes a route
and will be a certain starter. The Cali
fornia Jockey Club adds $3000.
ENTRIES FOR TO-DAY.
The California Jockey Club received
official notification from the Crescent
City Jockey Club, New Orleans, yester
day stating that the entries of Tommy
Griffin had been ordered refused. His
trainer, McCloskey, is indefinitely sus
pended. Tommy's troubles were
brought about by substituting a
scrubby-looking filly in the paddock at
New Orleans for Sweet Pepper. This
trick caused the odds to recede and,
when the money had all been bet, the
real Sweet Pepper was led into the
paddock.
Wiggins, the filly formerly owned by
Willie Rink, was heavily backed to
take the opening event. 3he was prob
ably a trifle short.
Jack Martin piloted two winners.
Escobosa was 100 to 1 at one stage
of the betting on the two-yt-ar-old race.
Gruwell could do nothing with Con-
Etellator, finishing .back in the bunch.
It begins to look as if The Fretter
has had his day. If within ten pounds
of his best form, Frank O'Rourke'a
Brutus horse looked good enough to
dispose of the. bunch starting, in the
mile and a furlong number. 'He was
accordingly backed down to 9 to 5 fa
voritism and 'finished absolutely last,
after being .miserably i handled by
Sherwood. Fille d'Or, a 30 to 1 out
sider, with C. Smith on her back,
passed Nellie Bawn on the far turn
and for a time looked all over a win
ner. Tiring, though, as the paddock
was approached, Expedient led the
mare out a neck. Elmer 1/ downed
the well played Cloche d'Or for the
show.
"Doc" Kyle finally landed a race
with Keynote. The Eastern horse
met an ordinary collection of platers
in the concluding mile and a sixteenth
run and at odds of 7 to 10 galloped in
first by six lengths. Ulloa took the
place from Theodora L by a head.
NOTES OP THE TRACK.
Everybody thought Gloomy Gus
would have an easy thing in taking the
two-year-old dash, buf he didn't. The
books held the Burns & Waterhouse
youngster a 7 to 10 chance, and in an
other driving finish he just did last

Young Corbett'aVapnarent/ careless
ness regarding hls^cqming- battle with
Jimmy Britt is causing his "admirers
some uneasiness. His present Intention
is to settle down to training* on Tues
day'next. This will allow him but fif
teen days in which to" prepare himself
for what is conceded to be a hard bat
tle." Â¦; â¢â¢ ' ". Â¦
- It was thought the lesson he. learned
when he fought Hanlon the first time
would ."make ** him cautious, jbufc it did
not -have ; a lasting effect. If Hanlon
had experienced men behind him' that
night the. general opinion is that he
would have won. as he caught his op
ponent entirely out of form.
:When Corbett fought Mc'Govern here
he was eleven pounds overweight five
days before the contest and was mak
ing no effort to get down to the re
quired figures. He was finally in
duced ' to take a serious view of the
situation and weighed in safely at the
appointed time.
'There is a suspicion that Corbett
holds Britt lightly and that he thinks
a little training will carry him through
safely. This confidence is likely to
prove his undoing some day when he
Is caught napping by some strong, am
bitious youngster.
Ten miles on the road at a fast clip
was part of th'e exercise taken by
Britt in his training work yesterday in
Alameda. With Fred Landers he took
to the highway in the morning ami
traveled from Croll's Gardens to Fruit
vale and return. After an easy rub
down Britt rested until 3 o'clock, when
he went into the gymnasium. There
he pummeled the punching bag for half
an hour and mixed with Landers for
six fast rounds. Jimmy did not go at
Landers as viciously as fie Intends to
later on, for the reason that Landers

BAY CITY CLUB PRESENTS
' AMATEURS OF ALL. KINDS
TO INVADE SOUTHERN
PACIFIC TERRITORY
Santa Fe Preparing to Bid for North
ern California Deciduous
Fruit Shipments.
The Santa Fe Railroad, through thÂ«
medium of the Santa Fe Disoatch, a
subsidiary company of the railroad,
has announced its intention of enter
ing Northern California as a formid
able competitor of the Southern Pa
cific in the handling of all kinds of
deciduous fruit. J. S. Leeds, manager
of the dispatch company, arrived from
Chicago last evening and admittted at
the Palace that he Is here to bid for
fruit shipments. He said:
"We have no particular grievance
against any one and do not intend to
inaugurate a battle royal, as some
may think. We simply want our pro
portion of the business. There is no
truth in the statement that we have
purchased river, steamers, but as the
Sacramento River is a waterway open
to any one and there is a great amount
of fruit grown along that river, it ia
likely that we will make an effort to
secure a portion of the business orig
inating In that district. We consider
that we have the best refrigerating
cars in operation, about 4000 in num
ber, and with our own rails from Cal
ifornia to Denver, Kansas City, St.
Joseph and Chicago and with an
abundance of experience, we believe
that we should have a share of the
fruit business from the northern part
of this State."
Mr. Leeds stated that in all proba
bility Antioch would be selected as a
point for handling the Northern Cal
ifornia fruit, it being particularly ad
vantageous' in the way of temperature
In moving fruit down the river into
the colder atmosphere of the bay.
WASHINGTON BANKRUPT
TAKEN INTO CUSTODY
Good Hnmorcd Crowd Howls at L.u
tllcron^ Sights Created by Clown-
Like Fighters.
The Bay City Athletic Club's bill of
boxing last night was a decidedly
unique one, in which amateurs with
and without skill were seen in the
ring.
The first match was a four-round
Â¦dispute between Frank Dell and Wil-"
liam, Brannan. The two men put up
a ludicrous bout and after four rounds
of clown-like pantomime the decision
was given to Dell.
James Leary of the Diamond Ath
letic Club and George Cole were the
next pair. They put up a rattling
good fight for four round, when Leary
was declared the winner for his ag
gressive work.
Young McClure and Carl Winters
went a few while it lasted, but a stiff
right to the jaw sent Winters to the
long count in the first round.
Ben Price and Arthur Oliver of the.
heavy-weight division fought two
rounds, when Oliver knocked his man
out. 'Â¦/â¢[',,
Harry Tenny put Manual Torres to
sleep in the second round with a
smashing left to the jaw. Torres put
up a great go and is as quick as chain
lightning. The men fought with the
agreement to protect themselves at all
times. The knock-out came in a
breakaway and Torres hit the mat as
if shot. He was carried to his corner
and it was some minutes before he re
gained consciousness.
The main event was between Jack
O'Brien and Jack O'Brien. Jack
O'Brien won. â¢ One of the men was
from the Telegraph Hill Club and the
other hails from the Brooklyn Club.
The south of the slot man successfully
defended the reputation of his neigh
borhood and was given the decision by
forcing the fight.
Alexander Isaacs, Adjudged Guilty of
Contempt, Is Arrested on Bench
Warrant.
Alexander Isaacs, a "Washington State

dise valued at 16379 23 and $1073 23 in

mining engineer. F. A. Phelps, one
of the Peru's passengers, helped to
bury the murdered man, but declares
he has forgotten his name. The dead
man hailed from Missouri and was of
German extraction. He was murdered
and robbed by a native whom he had
hired to guide him over the hills.'
Charles Larsen, who arrived here
yesterday, a passenger on the Panama
liner Peru, knows all about the Rob
inson Crusoe business. He has just
spent fifteen months all alone on
Clipperton Island, where he was em

him a dog, made the acquaintance of
many strange birds and declares that
he enjoyed the isolation of his abode.
A British warship paid a visit to the
island and with the exception of the
schooner which brought his relief and
took him to the mainland was the
only vessel he saw during his stay at
Clipperton. Little guano has been
shipped from this island the list few
years, but the owners of the conces
sion employ a care taker to maintain
the buildings in repair.

Butter rules weak and buyers have the ad
vantage, though quotations . are not actuallv
lower. Stocks are still large and the demand
Is not brisk. -
, | The Cheese market is stationary, stocks being
as larse and the feeling as weak as ever i
Top quotations for Eggs are still maintained,
but thÂ«v inside quotations for both ranch and
store are lower. The feeling continues weak
especially as some large retail houses through
out the city are extensively advertising to sell
at the rate of -two dozen for 35c. Stocks are
still enormous and dealers will soon have to
begin to store whether the Eggs be fit to go
into the icehouse or not. It is a case of doing
something or other to clear off the heavy sur
plus.. The sharp decline has resulted in a
good' shipping demand for the northern coast
and It was reported yesterday that Sunday's

A press dispatch from Portland says that
Hops there are weak at 24c for the best, with
prices tending downward. There are said to
be about 20.000 bales of Hops on hand on the
Pacific Coast, and this amount it waa thought
a few months ago would be needed by the
London brewers, but these aver that they have
plenty to do them until next season opens.
English brewers also say that bad times
throughout Great Britain have curtailed the
consumption of beer and that their business is
therefore not so prosperous as In 1903.

Everything Is gone into minutely and
the inspection is carried out In ac

undertaken in several years. The
general hospital buildings were , in

as the hospital is now composed of
some dozen or more separate build

more than 600 patients.
The drill of the Ninth Cavalry on
Thursday night came as a great sur

It took place shortly after 7 o'clock

blast gave the signal "to arms." In
thirty-two minutes the entire squad

to go into action. Major Bigelow ex

the work of his command.
Colonel E. H. Crowder called on

The board tore down a fence that
obstructed. Magnolia avenue for a
width of seventeen and a half feet at
Webster street. The owner added that
amount cf land to his 120 feet of land
which he owned and failed to obey the
board's order to take the fence down.
There is a large number of other
fences on public streets which must
come down, and the Board of Works
intends to put an end to the practice
of property owners realizing revenue
from land which belongs to the city
and not to them.
As a result Commissioner Woodward
reported yesterday that the fences
v.'hich obstructed half of the roadway
on London "and Paris streets, near
China avenue,' were' removed by the
property owners. One individual had
fenced in half of the roadway of Fel
ton street frotn Yale to'Oxford, a dis
tance of two blocks, but he obeyed the
removal order with alacrity.
Notice was also served on Lovell
White to remove the fences on Charter
Oak avenue at Thornton and Silver
avenues, the entire width of the street
being utilized as a vegetable garden.
If the fences are not removed at cmee
they \i 111 be torn down by the Board of
Works.
The Board of Public Works, through
Commissioner Woodward, yesterday
caused the removal of a number of
fences which have been obstructing
certain public streets for many years
in the University Mound and other out
lying districts.
Several property owners in defiance
of all legal right took it upon them
selves to fence in about half of the
roadway in front of their own prop
erty and then rented the increased area
to vegetable growers and flower pro
ducers. Peremptory notices were
served on these owners to take the
fences down, or the Board of Works
would have its own men carry out the
order.
"Why," said Wilson, turning to
Chief of Police Wittman, "we have
wide open gambling here and wide
open brothels and the town is going
to the bad on those lines. Let us be
gin to suppress the big deviltries. We
have too much law now and I don't
believe in it I am pleading for the
right of free discussion, but not for
any particular class."
"This proposed ordinance," said J.
J. Paulsell, "violates the constitution
relative to the free exercise of relig
ious worship, the right to the liberty
of speech and the right of citizens to
assemble in public places. This
board has the power to control and
regulate, but not to prohibit."
A. Wood of the Salvation Army
made a plea for street meetings and
referred to a decision of Lord Chief
Justice Coleridge that the streets
could be used for public gatherings.
Chief Wittman argued in favor of
the ordinance as a good police regu
lation. Supervisor Brandensteln took
exception to a remark made by one of
the speakers that the votes of the Su
pervisors on the ordinance would be
watched by the labor people. Bran
denstein branded the remark as an in
sult to the members of the board, who.
he. said, were above any such insinu
ation.
The committee recommended the
passage of an ordinance making it un
lawful to, conduct any business in a
building connected with any j place
used for Immoral purposes.
The Joint Committee on Judiciary
and Fire postponed action on the pro
posed ordinance providing for a free
and unobstructed passageway to exits
for fire escapes on buildings. . Fire
Marshal Towe submitted : a diagram
providing for fire escapes on t the-sides
of buildings. The committee decided
to meet on Friday, March 18,. at 1
p. m., to consider all legislation de
signed to insure the safety of theaters
and other buildings.
The joint Supervisors' Committee
on Judiciary and Police yesterday took
under advisement the proposed or
dinance prescribing a district within
which it is prohibited to hold meet
ings on the public streets, which had
been submitted by the Police Depart
ment.
Rev. Dr. Edwards, representing the
Federation " of Missions, said that the
ordinance would prevent meetings of
the Salvation Army and the va/lous
missions. Edwards objected to a pro
hibitive ordinance on the subject.
|tev. J. A. B. Wilson, representing
several branches of the Protestant de
nomination protested against the or
dinance in the name of 100,000 con
stituents. Wilson thought any one
should be allowed to speak on the
streets, which he designated as the
poor man's "temple of liberty." He
further protested against shutting out
the people who desired to discuss la
bor or other questions. Wilson said
it was not wise to load the Police De
partment with petty ordinances when
there were graver matters requiring
its attention.
"Under this section," said the
Mayor, "there is at present a vacancy
in the office of City Engineer which
the Board of Public Works is at lib
erty to fill at once. Several names
are under consideration by the board,
but no selection has been made as
yet."
President Schmitz of the Board of
Works stated that *Grunsky*s successor
â¢would be chosen in a few days, but
declined to give out the names of any
that had reasonable chances of ap
pointment to the place.
City Engineer C. E. Grunsky yes
terdaypresented his resignation to the
Board of Public Works. The resigna
tion was brief and conveyed the in
formation that Grunsky had received
telegraphic advices that his appoint
ment by President Roosevelt as an
Isthmian Canal Commissioner had
been confirmed by the United States
Senate. Grunsky asked that his resig
nation take effect at the pleasure of
the board, but preferably on March
8, 1S04.
The resignation was handed to
President Schmitz of the Board of
Works, who at once notified his
brother, Maj-or Schmitz, of Grunsky's
decision to give up municipal office.
The Mayor considers that Grunsky
has vacated the position of CItv En
gineer under section 4 of "Miscel
laneous" of the city charter, which
provides as follows:
Section 4 â Any perron holding- a salaried of
fice under the city and county, whether by
election or appointment, who shall, during his
term of office, hold or retain any other salaried
office under the Government of the United
Btate?. or of this Ftate, or- who shall held any

cramfnt of the city and county, or who shall

deemed to have thereby vacated the office held

fense, and was folldwed by Attorney
Alford. Alford made one of his char
acteristic strong pleas for an acquittal
and exhaustively went over the testi
mony. He dwelt upon Feld's appear
ance and said that he did not look a
murderer. He endeavored to pick to
pieces the testimony of the eye-wit
nesses to the shooting and accused
them of perjury. Mr. Alford concluded
with the statement that he had done
the best he could for his client, but did
not have any witnesses.
District Attorney Lewis F. Byington
then closed for the people. During the
course of his remarks he took occasion
to look Feld in the, eye and, pointing his
finger at him," say: If there was ever a
crime committed in this community
that appeals to law-abiding citizens for
punishment it Is the crime for which
this defendant is before you to-day."
The jury was composed of the follow
ing citizens:
H. T. Bray. James S. Bailer. Martin Keat
ing Joseph Michael. F. M. Rust. J. Stamper.
II. Schroder. Alexander Thaln. C. P. Wrtrht.

Deputy District Attorney Whiting
then 'opened for the prosecution. He
reviewed the testimony and pointed out
the Inconsistency of the defense. Judge
J. A. Spinetti then opened for the de-
The trial was resumed at 10 o'clock
yesterday morning, and the defense
placed Emil Feld, a brother of the de
fendant, on the stand to corroborate
the testimony given by Patrolman Neil
Riordan the preceding day relative to
the visit to the Dirking house after the
shooting. The defense then rested, and
District Attorney Byington then of
fered to place George F. Kelly, Walter
Kelly and Detective Gibson on the
stand in rebuttal of the testimony given
by J. Bouse that the rear door bore no
evidence oÂ£ having been kicked. An
objection by the defense to the intro
duction of the testimony was sustained.
Detective E. L. Gibson was then
called by the prosecution and testified
that on the front door of the Dirking
residence were marks that had the' ap
pearance of having .been made with a
"jimmy" similar to the one introduced
at the trial.
Mrs. Quarles next testified that Feld
had said In her presence that "he would
fill his wife- full of lead and buy her a
lot in the cemetery."
PLEADS FOR ACQUITTAL.
"When the case was submitted to the
jury, shortly before 5 o'clock, Feld's
mother was completely prostrated and
had to be assisted from the courtroom.
When the jury returned with its ver
dict Mrs. Feld was unable to be present.
MOTHER IE PROSTRATED.
"If Joseph Feld's little girl. Violet,
were In the courtroom now she would
no doubt^Hmb up on his knee, extend
ing both her chubby arms and say
'papa.' "
This reference to his child affected
Feld, and for the first time during the
course of the trial he manifested some
feeling by giving vent to tears. His
aged mother, who has been at his side
continuously, bore up bravely until the
beginning of the arguments, and then
sobbed pitifully on her son's shoulder.
Joseph Feld must die on the sallows
for the murder of his father-in-law,
Fritz Dlrklnff, on the night of Novem
ber 2, , 1903. After deliberating about
half an hour the jury brought In a ver-Â«
diet to that effect at 5:30 o'clock last
evening. The verdict came as a great
shock to Feld, and he broke down com
pletely. When being taken from the
courtroom he cried and said, "What
will my poor mother do?"
The last day of the trial was taken
up principally with the arguments of
counsel for the people and the defense.
During the course of Judge Spinettl's
forceful statement to the jury In behalf
of the defendant he said:
VERDICT THAT FIXES

The Montana court has fined Heinie
and his associates $2000 each, and has
sentenced them to-be imprisoned until
the fine shall have been paid and until
they shall have obeyed the order of
the court. .They were released from
custody pending the appeal.
The conclusion we reach is that the JudK
ment of contempt, of court which the appellants
eeek to have reviewed upon tHe present writ
of error Is a Judgment in a civil proceeding;
that it is remedial and coercive in its execu
tion and that it has been entered by the court
for the purpose of enforcing the private rights
of the complainant, judicially determined In
its favor, and that the appellants are subject
to its terms and conditions. It follows that
It tÂ» a Judgment that cannot be reviewed upon
this writ of error and the writ of error is
therefore dismissed at appellants' costs.
The United States Circuit Court of
Appeals yesterday dismissed the appeal
of F. Augustus Helnze, Joslah H..Tre
rise and Alfred FYank, found guilty by
the United States Circuit Court for
the District of Montana of contempt
for having violated an order permit
ting: the. inspection and survey by the
Butte and Boston Consolidated Mining
Company of certain underground work
ings from the Rarus, Johnstown and
Pennsylvania claims beneath the sur
face of the Michael Devlft claim owned
by the Butte and Boston Company.
It was contended that the court had
no Jurisdiction to review the judgment
of the Circuit Court in this case.
Judges Gilbert, Ross and Morrow, be
fore whom, the matter was argued,
handed down an opinion yesterday ad
verse to the appellants. In quoting
from the contempt case of Devitt the
court says:
They carry thÂ« keys of their prison la their
own pockets. Courts are established to de
termine the rlsbts and remedies of litigants
by peaceable discussions under the law Instead
o? by the wages of battle. They are not In
fallible, but no better method of determining
adverse claims has yet been devised.
. No constitutional right Is denied to the ap
pellants In \ this case. They are not required
to furnish evidence against themselves. They
arc slniDly to unbar their doors, stand and
allow the representatives of the complainant
to ascertain whether In the depths below the
surface of their own property the defendant
in the suit in which this controversy has
ailaen is not engaged in extracting and carry
ing away the wealth of the property. The
complainant Is simply asking to be allowed
to protect Its own property and rights and It
would be a miserable failure of justice If the
court has not the power to enforce obedience
to its orders in such a proceeding'.
The Court below In Its Judgment of contempt
found j as a fact that Helnze, Frank and
Trtrise had. full knowledge and notice of the
order of Inspection and Its terms, and during
all the times mentioned In the order they were
able to comply with its terms.
