ATTEMPT BY JAPANESE TO ENTRAP
RUSSIAN FLEET ENDS IN DISASTER
ST. PETERSBURG, Feb. 25(2:40 a. m.)~A telegram from Viceroy Alexieff to the Czar says: "At a quarter before 3 on the morning of
Feuruary 24 numerous Japanese torpedo boats attempted to attack the battleship Retvizan and sink large steamers loaded with iiiflammablfis.
The Retvizan was the first to observe the torpedo boats and opened aj strong fire on them. She was supported by .the land batteries. She de
stroyed two steamers near the entrance of the harbor; they were comin|| firectly toward her. One of them went on the rocks aear the lighthouse
on Tiger peninsula; the other sank under Golden Hill. The. Retvizan -observed four steamers,, in a sinking condition, and eight torpedo boats
departing slowly to rejoin the waiting Japanese warships. A portion of the crews of the Japanese vessels were- drowned. The grounded steamer
is still burning. The enemy is observed in the offing of Port Arthur in two lines." v
Conflicting Stories Tell of
Sinking of Japanese
Warships.
ST. PETERSBURG, Feb. 25 (2:12 a. m.).â Reports of a
Russian victory at Port Arthur were current late yesterday aft
ernoon and early in the evening, and about midnight they
seemed to have been definitely confirmed ; but in the absence of
an official announcement the stories of the dimensions of this
victory were most conflicting and confusing in character.
The most circumstantial report was that the Japanese had
attempted to bottle up Admiral Stark's fleet in Port Arthur by
sinking vessels and laying mines at the entrance o'f
the harbor, employing the tactics of Hobson at Santiago during
the Spanish-American war.
* According to this account, two Japanese ships appeared off
the harbor with a Japanese fleet behind them and ostensibly in
pursuit. The Russians, however, suspected a ruse, and their ships
steamed out, sank the stone-laden vessels, engaged and defeated
the enemy and drove them off. The reports of the loss inflict
ed, however, are conflicting.
All of the stories included the features of the vessels loaded
with stones, but. according to some versions, the Japanese fleet
was convoying transports with the purpose of effecting a landing
at Pigeon Bay, and after the failure of this preliminary maneu
ver the Russians played havoc with both the Japanese warships
and the transports, sinking four of the former and two of the
latter. One account gives the name of the battleship Retzivan as
the vessel which particularly distinguished herself during the
action by ramming and sinking one of the Japanese battleships.
Rumors of this victory were spread far and wide over the
city during the early part of the evening, and the crowds which

ORDERS BISCOE
UNDER ARREST
Rear Admiral Evans Charges
Paymaster of Oregon With
Being Short in' His Accounts
SENSATION IS CREATED
Action Revives Story of Nicholr
son's Court-Martial for Of
fending the German Consul
News was received here yesterday
from Manila that Paymaster Harry
Earl Biscoe of the Unrted States bat
tleship Oregon had b|en ordered under
arrest by Rear-Admiral Evans, in cqm
mand of the fleet in Asiatic waters, for
an alleged 'Irregularity in his accounts.
The arrest of Biscoe is the culmination
of the controversy that has been go
ing on for v some months past between
Admiral Evans and Biscoe*, growing out
of the findings in the Paymaster Rich
worth Nicholson court-martial case.
Biscoe, it seems, # was fcnfe of the mem
bers of the court-martial ?that tried
Paymaster Rich worth .* Nicholson last
September at Chef u,' China, for conduct
unbecoming an officer and a gentleman.
The offense , charged against . Nichol
son was that he attacked the German
Consul at Chefu at a public ball at that
place and caused a great commotion by
his actions. Nicholson was said to have
been very drunk at the time. The case
created a great stir in naval circles
and nearly became an international af
fair between this country and Ger
many.
A court-martial was convened at
Chefu and Nicholson was found guilty
and sentenced to aTeduction of five
numbers in -grade.
Rear Admiral Evans, commanding
the Asiatic squadron'^ in his review of
the findiVigs, ''severely arraigned the
court for the inadequate sentence im
posed and some of his statements in
his review were far frorrt compliment
ary to the members of the board;
The conduct of Nicholson* was a
source of mortification to the Navy
Department officials and the action of
Admiral Evans in arraigning the court
for what is deemed its inadequate sen
tence was heartily approved.
The review of the findings caused
great indignation in the breasts of the
nine members of the court-martial,
and,, headed by Biscoe, they sent a
formal note to the Secretary of the
Navy, demanding that Admiral E\'ans
be ! requested to withdraw certain
statements in his - review. After a
time Secretary Moody gave out a re
ply, which, while it upheld Admiral
Evans in the course he had pursued,
mildly Intimated that the admiral was
to be slightly more conservative in-fu
ture cases of a similar order.
This answer was In no way satis
factory to Biscoe. and while the other
members of the court-martial decided
to let the matter rest. deter
mined to force the issue to the limit,
and a month ago he put his side of
the case straight before the President,
hotly demanding that Admiral Evans
be made to withdraw the statements
that were objectionable. The Presi
dent has now the case under advise
ment.
Biscoe is said to be very hot-headed,
gritty and tenacious, and from his ac
tions in the premises it would appear
that such is the case. He is a native
of Michigan. A short time ago he
married the wealthy Miss Hammersly
of Philadelphia, one of the society
belles of that city. He has a brother
in the army, Earl Biscoe, lieutenant
in the Ninth Company, Coast Artil
lery, stationed at Fort Barrancas, Fla.
Harry Biscoe joined the Oregon at
Benningtbn navy yard last June, re
lieving Paymaster Lawrence Heap.

Harlan also admitted he lied when he

W. E. Valk, another clerk, testified
to-day that he had merely expedited
certain cases for Benson in a legitimate

he will surrender himself to the au

INSULTS THE "MEDICINE
MAN" AND IS SHOT DEAD
Quarrel Between Indians Over Merits
of Doctors Results hi a
Tragedy.
FRESNO, Feb. 24.â Enraged by an
affront offered to a "medicine man" of
his tribe, Charles Aybemi. a Yosemite
Indian living near Pollasky, Monday
shot and instantly killed an Indian
named Hoppie. A young girl in the
Indian camp was very sick and there
was much discussion among the red
men as to whether they should call in
a white doctor or their own "medicine
man," Mallopi, famed far and wide as
a wizard. Hoppie, who had been
drinking and was in a quarrelsome
mood, -was one of those who -expressed
the, most incredulity of the wizard's
ability to do the girl any good. The
counsels of the elder Indians prevailed
and Mallopi was sent for, arriving not
long afterward on horseback. Mean
while hot words had passed between
Aybemi and, Hoppie, the latter jeering
at his companion and vowing that
when the Indian doctor arrived his
much-vaunted powers should be put to
the test. As Mallopi rode up Hoppie
advanced to the middle of the road and,
drawing a sharp dirk from his pocket,
slashed the horse across the ribs, cry-
Ing as the blood gushed forth:' .
"There, great medicine man, heal
that and prove what you can do."
The words were hardily out of his
mouth when Aybemi jerked out a re
volver and dropped him with a bullet
through his brain. Word of the trag
edy was sent to Madera and Constable
Bigelow placed Aybemi under arrest,
taklng v him to the County Jail. The
generalsentiment among the Indians is
that Hoppie met with a just retribution
for offering such an affront to Mallopi.

SACRAMENTO AND AMERICAN
RIVERS ARE SLOWLY RISING
Soft, Warm Rains That Prevail in the Mountains Cause
the Snow to Melt, and, Although the Feeders of These
Streams Are Booming, No Serious Damage Is Expected
SACRAMENTO, Feb. 24.â To-day wit
nessed a considerable rise in the Sacra
mento River, but the water can reach
nearly four feet higher without endan
gering the banks. Such a rise is not
locked for, since the water would flow
over the Yolo levee, on the opposite
side, before it could attain such a
height. Reports received from all
points to-day confirm the belief that a
period of high water may be expected
to-morrow, to continue so long as the
soft, warm rains prevail in the moun
tains, causing the snow to melt and
making all the feeders of the American
and Sacramento rivers boom. A great
mass of driftwood, consisting in large
part of cut logs from the mountain
lumber camps, is being carried past
Sacramento by the rapid and fast wid
ening current. The down river farm
ers, who have reclaimed their valuable
lands by building high levees around
them, are experiencing much alarm,
since the height of the river at this
pointâ nearly twenty-six feetâ indicates
that the danger line has been reached
farther down the stream. The usual
relief in such an emergency comes from
breaks in the weak levees on the Tolo
side, which may be expected to-mor
row. Sacramento each year suffers
from reports from high water and im
pending floods, but as a matter of fact
the city is perfectly safe and the citi
zens express no fear of trouble. At
some places in the mountains and val
leys the rainfall for the last twenty
four hours has reached more than, two
and one-half inches.
On the Oroville branch of the South
ern Pacific Railroad the water had risen
to such an extent that no trains were
running to-day, while on the line be
tween Woodland and Marysville no
trains were running farther than
Chandler station. The railroad com
pany is locking for still higher water
at various valley points to-morrow,
while the weather bureau has warned
all river residents that danger line
stages may be reached by to-morrow.
MARYSVILLE SHUT OUT.
Flood Waters Cut Off City From the
Outside World.
MARYSVILLE, Feb. 24.â For the last
twenty-four hours the city of Marys
ville has been practically shut out from
the outside world by flood water, which
at a late hour to-night is slowly rising.
Rain fell steadily all night and nearly
all day and continues at this writing.
Not only is this the case all through
the valley, but reports received here
to-night verify the statement from the
headwaters of the Yuba and Feather
rivers that the same conditions have
existed at those points for the last
twenty-four hours. The Yuba River
registers 19:7 feet, and with the Feather
is continuing to rise. It is expected
that the high water mark, 21 feet, will
be reached before morning.
The country to the north, south and
west Is flooded. The lev^e along the
south bank of the Yuba near the Brad
ley farm has given way in four differ
ent places and a large volume of wa
ter is pouring out over the country
to the south between this city and
Reeds station. Farmers from that sec
tion say the water extends as far as
the eye can see. However, it is be
lieved that but little damage will re
sult in that section, as the water runs
off quickly when the river recedes.
Some livestock has been drowned, but
the loss is not heavy. The levee break
ing shuts out all travel from the south
and Wheatland except by rail. The
Knights Landing and Oroville route of
the Southern Pacific line is inundated
for several miles and no trains were
run to-day.
The rapid rise of the Feather River
to-day cut off travel from the north
and from Sutter County.
So far as the city of Marysville is
concerned, no trouble is anticipated, as
the levee system Is in excellent condi
tion. No chances are being taken, how
ever, men patrolling the great dykes
day and night. The break on the south
side has lessened the strain. Reports
from the Government barriers on the
Yuba say that the water has passed
the high water mark and is rising at
the rate of 10 inches per hour.
Some alarm is felt by merchants and
they are moving their goods to high
places. Every available man is being
hired by the cltyho patrol the levee.
RAIN FALLS AT SALINAS.
Precipitation Comes in Time to Prove
of Value to Monterey County.
SALINAS, Feb. 24.â A mild south
easterly wind has developed a drizzling
rain that promises to be of great value
to this county. The rain began falling
about 6 o'clock this evening and has
continued steadily ever since. The to
tal precipitation for the season In the
upper part of the Salinas Valley has
been about five inches. Salinas has
had to date 4.42 inches. In the lower
sections of the county around Soledad,
King City and San Lucas the totals
have been less. In spite of the fact
that the average is much smaller than
usual the prospects are fair. The hills,
which three weeks ago were bare, are
rapidly showing in feed. From Jolon
and the cattle sections of the county
reports are that the cattle will pull
through If no heavy frosts come. In
the valley many of the farmers will
raise hay, and, with the usual spring
rains, the northern part of Monterey
County will show a large acreage in
beets. The present stretch of mild
weather has started feed of all sorts
and has greatly relieved the fears of a
dry year. Around San Miguel and
along the line of San Luis Obispo Coun
ty reports state that the cattle will
pull through and the spring rains in
sure plenty" of feed.
ADDITIONAL LANDSLIDES.
Trains on the California Northwestern
Railroad Arc Delayed.
SANTA ROSA, Feb. 24.â Two addi
tional landslides occurred on the Cali
fornia ! Northwestern Railroad to-day,
making a total of five within the past
few days. The heavy rainfall is re
sponsible for the slides. About five
miles north of Cloverdale a slide oc
curred during the night and a large
force. of men was put to work to re
move it. The train from Ukiah was
more than an hour late reaching Clo
verdale, and the train from that city
fHE SAN FRANCISCO CALL. THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 25, 1904.
was held until the arrival of the one
from the north. This made the morn
ing train to San Francisco late reach
ing the metropolis. The Ukiah express
was caught behind a second landslide
in the afternoon and did not pass
through this city until after 5 o'clock,
more than an hour behind time. The
rains have ceased and there will prob
ably be no further trouble on the road.
High water is reported from all sec
tions, especially in the vicinity of
Guerneville. The Laguna and Green
Valley creeks are quite high. The to
tal rainfall for the season in this city
is 23.94, as compared with 23.15 at a
corresponding date last year.
Plenty of Rain at Auburn.
AUBURN, Feb. 24.i-Twenty-five
inches of rain have fallen here this sea
son, six of which have fallen within the
last forty-eight hours. The fall of, last
night and to-day has been almost un
precedented. The streams are full to
overflowing and many washouts are
reported. The extreme warm weather
has caused the snow to melt high up in
the mountains and fears are enter
tained for those living along the Sacra
mento River. The American River at
this point is extremely high. The grass
shows a wonderful growth and stock
men are happy. The hay and grain
men have their crops all in and are
confident of a large yield. The fruit
men are also counting on an abundant
harvest.
Santa Clara Valley Gets Wetting.
SAN JOSE, Feb. 24.â Rain began fall
ing early this morning and from 10
o'clock to darkness there was a heavy
downpour. A light rain is falling this
evening and every indication points to
an all-night storm. Half an inch of
rainfell to-day, making a total of 6.25
for the season. Up to this time last
year 10.12 inches of rain had fallen. The
rain this year has come at opportune
times, it all soaking into the ground
and not causing floods. Good hay and
grain crops are assured with the pres
ent storm and the feed on the hill
ranges will ba given a good start. The
present storm just comes right for the
orchardists and will greatly benefit the
fruit trees, which will soon begin to
bud.
Stockton Farmers Cry "Enough."
STOCKTON. Feb. 24.â The rain con
tinues and the farmers are crying

the county. High water is reported
east of Stockton, though it is believed
there is no immediate danger of a flood.
The crop outlook could not be better.

RAINFALL IS HEAVY.
Rivers in Northern Part of State Art;
Running Unusually High.
The rainfall was heavy yesterday
throughout Central and Northern Cal

Weather Bureau 'stated last evening
that he thought the southern section
of the State would get rain to-day.
The winds were light all along shore.
The rivers in the northern part, of
the State were swollen to abnormal
proportions. Overflows were threat

NAVY PROJECT
STIRS DEBATE
Burton, of Ohio Again Bitterly
Opposes the Clause Provid
ing for a New Battleship
DISCUSSION IS HEATED
Several Features Arc Elimi
nated From the Bill and
Other Changes May Be Made
WASHINGTON, Feb. 24.â Two storm
centers were encountered in considera
tion of the naval appropriation bill in
the House to-day. First, the great
lakes training station went out of the
bili on a point of order, after a wordy
battle. The building programme pro
posed in the bill then met criticism and
blocked further progress of the meas
ure for the day. Burton of Ohio, the
echoes of whose sensational speech for
peace on Monday had hardly died out,
moved to strike out, the provision for
the single battleship authorized. This
motion is now pending. It served as a
text, after Burton had supplemented
his Monday's speech with figures" show
ing that the United States was build
ing more naval vessels than any other
European country except Great Britain,
for several Republican speeches, in
which Burton was declared not to be
in line with his party. In the event of
the defeat of this motion and the ac
ceptance of the whole building pro
gramme a motion is to be made to
morrow by Representative Meyer of
Louisiana to have the bill recommitted
to the Naval "Committee with the fol
lowing instructions:
First, to provide for a coaling station
and dock .at Olangapo, P. I., instead of
a naval station; second, to eliminate
the provision for two armored cruisers,
and the armor thereof, costing S15.00Q,
000; third, to place a limit of $338 per
ton as a maximum price for armor
plate, with the provision for an armor
plate factory to cost not over $4,000,
000 if the armor cannot be procured
within the limit prescribed; fourth, that
all vessels herein provided for under
the head of "increase of the navy" ex
cept the battleship, be constructed iu
Government navy yards.
After extended discussion of various
sites the paragraph in the bill provid
ing for a naval training station was
ruled out of the bill, Cooper insisting
on the point of order.
Burton of Ohio, in moving to strike
from the bill the authorization for a
new battleship, resented criticisms
which he said had been made against
him for his speech on Monday against
the proposed naval programme. It had
been said that he was out of line with
the Republican party. This he denied
vigorously. He justified his position
by comparing the battleship construc
tion this year with that' of other na
tions'of the world.' Our construction,
he said, was larger than usual. In
naval expenses the United States was,
he said, with the exception of Great
Britain-, 50 per cent ahead of any Euro
pean nation.
Grosevnor of Ohio criticized Burton's
position. He read the plank on the
navy in the Ohio Republican platform
of 1903, on which, he said, the late la
mented Senator Hanna was so tri
umphantly indorsed. This plank, he
said, Burton had certainly indorsed,
or at least he had not repudiated It. It
read:
As America's part In preserving the peace of
the world, we Indorse the Republican policy of
developing- the United States navy to the high
est efficiency.
"Peace on earth and good will among
men depended on good ships and good
guns," was Grosvenor's announced doc
trine. He appealed to the Democrats:
"Don't forsake the only good thing
there, is in your record. Don't go off
after new idols."
At 5:04 p. m. the House adjourned. <

AMERICAN-BUILT WARSHIP RETVIZAN DOES VALIANT SERVICE FDR
Alexieff Warns Chinese to
Keep' Peace or Be
Exterminated.
YINKOW, Feb. 24.â Viceroy Alexieff
has caused a proclamation to be issued
throughout Manchuria notifying the
Chinese that Russia is at war with
Japaji on account of Japan's treacher
ous attack on the Russian fleet.
This proclamation is under six head
ings. The first warns the inhabitants
that thfy must prevent the encroach
iuent of Chinese on Kussian territory.
Second, Russian and Chinese inter
ests are declared to be identical; but as
China says sh<* wishes to maintain neu
trality, therefore all officials in Man
churia, instead of hindering, must as
sist the Russian army.
Third, the peoule shall continue their
occupations and shall treat the Rus
sian troops with confidence.
Fourth, the railroad telegraphs are
left to the protection of the people, who
will be held responsible in case they
are Injured.
The fifth heading warns the people
not to obey the threats of the chunchus
(bandits), who are the curse of Man
churia, but to assist the troops to ex
terminate them; if they do not assist
in this they also will be treated as rob
bers.
Sixth, If the people antagonize the
troops or show them hatred they will
be exterminated without mercy. The
Government Is taking steps in any
event to protect its interests.
The proclamation makes an earnest
appeal for the sympathy of the people
in the present crisis when, it says,
"Russia must put her back to the
wall."
H. B. Miller, United States Consul at
Newchwang, i? unceasingly active in
his endeavors to protect Japanese refu
gees and has made further demands for
Information as to the whereabouts of
the refugees. He has made strong rep
resentations in the matter of the right
of search and inspection.
The reorganization of the viceregal
administration is now going forward
and is 'expected to take one month.
Meanwhile there are considerable com
plications and uncertainty in all inter
national and domestic quarter*.
l'ELLETAN REPORTS
UPON CONDITION OF
THE FRENCH NA\ r Y
PARIS. Feb. 24. â In consequence of
contradictory reports as to the present
state nf the French navy the
Parliamentary Committee on Naval
Affairs requested Minister of Marine
Pelletan to supply it with information
on the subject and a conference took
place ai the Palais Bourbon. The
statements there made by Pelletan
gave great satisfaction and the com
mittee has embodied them in a pub
lished report.
After declaring that he did not con
sider a conflict likely, but that France
must be prepared for such a contin
gency, Pelletan said the French fleet
was in excellent condition. The navy
had at its disposal five armored cruisers
of the most modern type and five more
such vessels would be ready to be com
missioned within a few weeks. Before
the end of this year the cruiser Dupetlt
Tnousars and the battleship Gambetta
would be ready fop service.
The Minister of Marine said he
would have liked to have more small
craft, but he was restricted in this by
the naval appropriations. All the tor
pedo-boat destroyers "on the stocks
were approaching completion. He
said he had ordered fix new sh!Â»
marines, to be five or six times larger
thnn the present type.
Attention has been given to the sub
ject of coaling stations, he continued,
and the appropriations for the stations
Pt Bizerta, Corsica and Algeria have
been increased.
Regarding the Far East, the Min
ister said it was impossible to weaken
France's fleets in Europe, but that four
torpedo-boat destroyers were being
pent out there. Measures taken be
fore the outbreak of the war for the
defense of Indo-China would make any
attempted landing there practically
impossible.
The general condition of France's
warships and stores left nothing to be
desired, he said, and her stocks of
coal considerably exceeded the regula
tion requirements.

connecting with Japan. Th*e request is
based on apprehension that the exist

to Shanghai, crossing the mouth of the
Yellow Sea, may, from their exposed
positions, be cut by the Russians and
Japan left completely isolated. At
Guam the projected cable, of course,
would be connected with the existing
American cable east and west.
Careful examination has been made
into the question as to whether or not
assent on the part of the United States
to thia request would involve a breach

Special Cable to The Call and New York

ST. PETERSBURG, Feb. 24.â There
Is a growing belief In official circles
that the outlook tends more than ever
toward international complications. In
spite of the formal declarations of neu
trality by the powers, headed by the
Americans and the English, they all
are gradually massing forces In the Far
East. The Buzheviya Viedmosti says:
"The first news of fighting at Port
Arthur has raised a terrible whirlwind
in the West and has everywhere given
rise to the conviction that a period of
war is before Europe."
There is a report here to-day that
Rear Admiral Evans has 2000 marines
ready to dispatch at a moment's no
tice. This once again stlfnulates the
strong anti-American feeling existing.
An evening paper publishes a report
that 50,000 Chinese'soldiers have gone
over to the Japanese army. It is also
said that the Japanese are landing at
Talienwan and other places.

reports are without connrrnation, and they arÂ« given simply as
examples of the stories which floated about in the excited crowds.
The excitement attained the fever point when- it was known defi
nitely that 'the Emperor had received a telegram giving details and
showing the Russian victory was even greater than at first reported.
Newspaper messengers Waited at the. Admiralty with fast horses ready
to carry away the news which it was known was being prepared. < When
the sheets were finally distributed at 2:?0 o'clock this morning a rush
was made for the exits and the assembled officers cheered wildly and

fHE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, FEBRUARY ILo, l'J04.
SUMMARY OF THE DAY'S WAR NEWS
ADMIRAL TOGO has evidently tried, as Rear Admiral Sampson did at Santiago, to bottle
up the opposing fleet' in a narrow-necked harbor. While reports are conflicting, it is
clear that an attempt? was. made to send in steamers (old transports, probably) and sink
them in the channel at Port: Arthur, which, in some places, is not more than ioo yards wide.
The attempt ended in disaster,!-, :
It may be f assumed that the : Russians had destroyers and cruisers weir out from the
entrance,, and tfiat an inner line of torpedo-boats and . launch pickets was maintained. With
these to give the alarm, the chances were strong that the Japanese 'ships were sunk by tlis
fire of the forts arid .cniisers long before reaching the narrow channel arid at a point where
there is plenty of room for ships to pass. The earlier reports that Japan lost four battleships
or cruisers are explained by later news. "Fire ships" are ;ot used in modern naval warfare.
London- was -depressed and Paris elated by earlier dispatches announcing the Japanese
Japan's treaty with Korea is a surprise to diplomats. Jc is considered possible that it
might make effective France's agreement to come to Russia's aid 'if thÂ£ latter row er becomes
involved in a war with two nations. ...... " : ' .
Russian Cruisers Engage the Japanese
Fleet Off Port Arthur Harbor.
SHANGHAI, Feb. 24. â -It is reported that the Chinese Foreign Office has agreed to allow
the Russian gunboat Mandjur to remain at Shanghai on the condition that she dismantle her rud
der and draw her fires. The Japanese cruiser Akitsushima (which arrived at Woosung, near here,
on February 19 to wait for the Mandjur) proceeded northward to-day. '
NAGASAKI, Feb. 24.â -The Japanese Government has seized 670 tons of mess beef which
was shipped from San Francisco on the steamship Korea on February 2 and. which was consigned
to the Russian Government at Vladivostok. It is believed that the Government will pur
chase the beef.
LONDON, Feb. 25.â Viceroy AlexiefFs dispatch to the Czar of Russia clearing up the doubts
caused by the sensational versions oif the last Port Arthur affair was received in London too late
to be published in the early editions of the morning papers; but it confirms the opinion, founded
upon earlier rumors, that Admnal Togo made a daring attempt to bottle up the Russian fleet at
Port Arthur, and although Viceroy Alexien" asserts that the entrance to the harbor of Port Arthur is still free, the
fact that Admiral Togo's fleet, minus the vessels ln.1ured in the- couragepUB exploit,, was Been steaming at full
speed in a southeasterly direction from Welhaiwel, is;interpreted as an indication of the Japanese admiral's satis
faction with the accomplishment of his design. * ..... ; . .
It Is pointed out that it would be difficult for the Russians, Jn the darkness of night, to ascertain just what
had occurred to the Japanese vessels, or to distinguish between, the hulks it was the Intention to sink and torpedo
boats. As two damaged vessels were observed steaming slowly away from Port Arthur and as the Japanese
fleet was going at full speed off Welhaiwei, It is presumed that the two" damaged .vessels might have gone else
where to repair. Â«_ '
Another explanation of the incompleteness of Admiral- Togo's squadron, as seen off Welhaiwel, is- that he
possibly left some vessels to watch oh* Port Arthur. . : -, , ;
Further details of this engagement from Independent sources are awaited with the greatest interest, hut it
is believed that the reports that Japanese battleships "or 'transports were sunk should be taken with a degree of
allowance.
A dispatch received here from Tokio this morning explains the recent suspension of Japanese naval opera
tion to have been chiefly due to bad weather prevailing in the gulf of Pechill; where there have been winds,

"The abolition of censorship of news
telegrams sent abroad from Russia Is
understood to have been the direct out
come of an Interview which Melville

Majesty the wisdom of abolishing the
censorship, and as a result of the man

Russia's Protest Against
Japan's Course Finds
Supporters.
ST. PETERSBURG, Feb. 24.â The
Russian Government believes a deep
Impression has been made upon inter
national sympathies by the note on the
subject of Japan's alleged violation of
the law of nations, sent to the Russian
Embassadors on Monday. The Govern
ment lays especial stress upon the Jap
anese action at Chemulpo, where, It is
pointed out. the Japanese seized and
cut the communications in order to
prevent Pavldff, the Russian Minister,
and the Russian warships Variag and
Koreltz receiving news of the rupture
of diplomatic relations and then
pounced upon the ships with a greatly
superior; force.
Russia contends that" this action
places Japan outside the pale of civll
ize'd nations and that It smacks so
much of barbarism that it must offend
the chlvalric sense Of civilized fair play.
In diplomatic circles the presentation
of Russia's case is considered strong,
the opinion being, even In unfriendly
quarters, that Japan in her haste to
cripple the Russian fleet at the outset,
committed a blunder by thus striking
a blow without warning, for which the
destruction ot two ships will not com
pensate.
It is further pointed out that If
Japan had allowed Pavloff to return
to a Russian port on board a Russian
warship her magnanimity would have
been universally applauded. *
BUYING HORSES FOR JAPAN.
Prince Lojanoff, the Governor of the
province of Tambov, has issued a warn

against selling horses to dealers, who
are trying to buy 2000 horses, ostensibly

Japanese.
Baron Budburg is starting for the
Far East to organize a flotilla of ten
hospital barges on the Amur River.
Kokovizhoff, on assuming the direc
tion of the Finance Ministry, paid a
glowing tribute to Witte, the former
Minister of Finance, but said he would
not venture at this crfsls to formulate
a programme, reserving that task until
the return of the blessing of peace.
The Novostl, reviewing the resources
of the treasury, figures that the total
amount at the disposal of the. Govern
ment for the conduct of the war is
1320,000,000. which it considers to be
quite sufficient, in view of the fact*
that a far more expensive campaign,
the Turkish war, waged on foreign ter
ritory, cost only J500.000.000; but if this
Is not ' sufficient, the paper contends.
Russia easily' can obtain a loan at
home or abroad, so long'asher mone
tary system remains" sound. The No
vosti adds:
"There is no fear of the depreciation
of the ruble, and if Russia outlives the
war without the ruble falling It will
be her greatest victory."
DISEASE MENACES ARMV.
The army journal raises a warning,
saying that the Japanese will not be
so dangerous as the diseases that will
decimate the army In the field, recall
ing the fact that Russia lost twice as
many men by disease during the Turk
ish war as by the bullets of the enemy,
and urging the organization of hy
gienic and disinfectant corps within
and in the rear of the army.
The family of a Hebrew surgeon of
Kieff, who volunteered for service at
the front, is attracting much attention
in Russian official circles. Under the
law his family was forbidden to reside
at Kieff after the surgeon's departure
and the police ordered the members
of the family to withdraw inside the
Jewish pale. The papers argue that
the family of a man who has gone into
the service of his country should .not
be punished, and the authorities prob
ably will rescind their action.
There Is an Incessant influx of sub
scriptions of money and contributions
of jewelry and other articles toward
the fund being raised to strengthen the
navy and aid the families of the vic
tims of the war; People of all relig
ionsâJews, Catholics, Lutherans and
Mohammedansâ are vying with one an

officials.
NEW: GROUPING OP POWERS.
Several hundred Turcomans have ap

occurrences are regarded by the Rus

CHICAGO. Feb. 24.â The Tribune
saj-s: Edward Relgar. whose per
sistent efforts to see President Roose
velt yesterday resulted in his arrest at
the White House, is known in Chicago.
P. S. Whiting of 73 Florence avenue,
says the man is his nephew, and his be
lief is based on Relgrar's notion that
people's names should be changed to
indicate their trade or profession. Whit
ing said that Kelgar was the name his
nephew, Frank Coe, frequently as
sumed under the delusion that he was
another individual.
Whiting says his nephew killed his
wife and attempted to kill himself a
few years ago.
According to Whitins. Coe or Relgar
has been suffering from mental trouble,
the result of a fall sustained fourteen
years ago when on his way from Pull
man, where he worked in the car
shops, to his home at Lima, Ohio. Coe
had fallen asleep In the smoker, and
being a somnambulist walked out of
the car and was found unconscious by
a switchman. In his fall he struck his
head against a switch, fracturing hia
skull.
Mr. Whiting said:
"Three years after that Coe was sent
to the detention hospital In Toledo.
but he was soon discharged and went
to Springfield. Ohio. He worked there
until four years ago, when he rose one
morning and shot his wife and himself.
His wife died, but he recovered and
was sent to the penitentiary for one
year, after which he was sent to the
insane asylum at Toledo again. He es
caped and went to New York, coming
to Chicago over a year ago."

Japan May Buy Fleet of
Airships From Inventor
Greth.
While there has as yet been no final
order to sign an agreement, it is prac
tically certain that the American Aerial
Navigation Company, whose headquar
ters are in this cit3% will be given a
contract to construct four air war me
ehines as quickly as possible for tbe
Japanese Government.
These machines, known as the Greth
airships, have proved themselves to be
more practicable than other machines
that have been experimented with on
the coast, and, being of Infinite value
to a nation engaged in warfare, there
remains little doubt as to the outcome
of the negotiations.
J. O. Brubaker, fiscal agent for the
Greth airships, said yesterday: -
"While matters have not reached the
point where I can say that we will
build four of these vessels for the Jap

This was the substance of directions

March 25 on the battleship Kentucky.
There are now onJy two other Ameri

SANTA CRIZ MEN SETTLE
I>I SPITE IN NOVEL WAY
Coin Is Tossed for First Bid on Land
and an Acvrptajioe l>ecd Is
Forthcoming.
SANTA CRUZ, Feb. 24. â A suit
which has been pending in the Su
perior Court here for seven years was
Fettled to-day in a novel way. It was
a partition suit of G. H. Harrington
against H. L. Middleton over 320 acres
in the Biff BaFin. The matter was re
ferred to three referees", who suggested
that it be arbitrated. The parties
agreed, each putting up certified
checks. Middleton, who owned two
thirds, produced a check for $10,000,
and Harrington, who owned one-third,
pave a check for S500G. In order to
choose one uho should bid first, WU
tiara T. Jeter, president of the Bank
of Santa Cruz County, tossed up a half
dollar. Middleton won and bid $12,000
for the entire tract of timber land.
Harrington raised it to $13,000 and it
was accepted. Midleton not raising it.
Before bidding began each had a deed
made out in fa\*or of the other, so
when Harrington's bid was accepted
Middleton passed over the deed. The
attorneys of each side were present
All parties w*>re entirely satisfied.
TEMPERANCE PEOPLE ASK
FOR LOCAL OPTION LAW
PORTLAND. Or.. Feb. 24.â The
temperance people have submitted a
petition asking that a local option
law be placed before the voters at the
June elections. As a consequence the
liquor interests are consolidating and
will send out calls for aid to all the
wholesale houses In California that
cell wines and liquors In Oregon.
A special reason for the alarm dis
played by the dealers in intoxicants is
that the proposed law will not require
a majority of all the rotes cast in or
der to become effective, but merely a
majority of those ballots upon which
an expression Is voiced. As the
solid vote of the Prohibition party
and every temperance organization in
the State will be cast for the bill the
liquor men have a fight of no small
magnitude on their hands.

the Japanese to put out four ships.
"We can construct four ships or even
more in as short a time as we could
one. In a rough estimate, I would say
that in forty days' time the vessels
would be ready for shipment. What
takes the time in constructing the ves
sels is in drying out the silk. Aside
from that the work can be rushed
through.
"As an engine of defense in time of
war the airship Is destined to wield
such tremendous power that the mere
contemplation of its destructive force
will make wars between nations Im
possible. Two great powers equipped
with 100 airships each would never dare
to engage in mortal combat. It would
mean nothing less than complete an
nihilation. The advent of the airship
means universal peace. But fortunate
ly in this case neither country is as
yet In possession of airships, and from
the point of an expert I would say that
Japan will be able to do great destruc
tion to her opponents should she decide
to adopt this modern instrument of
war."

not to be over-sanguine in the belief
that a treaty will shortly be '-signed.
It is pointed out here that the- Russo-

complications growing out of that con

the part of the negotiators of the arbi

HEAVY INCREASE
IN GREAT BRITAIN'S
NAVAL ESTIMATES
LONDON. Feb. 24.â The^British naval
estimate for 1904-05 totals*$184,445,000, a
net increase of $12,360,000 over the esti
mate for 1903-04.
More than half the increase In the
estimates is due to the determination
to pay the entire balance due on the
recently purchased Chilean battleships
on April 1 and to provide them with
ammunition for the next year. The re
mainder of the increase arises from ex-*
pansion of the fleet, increase irf pay of
the personnel and material.
The" estimates provide for a total of
$58,270,880 for new construction, of
which $3,210,415 will be devoted to the
commencement of new, ships. The Ad
miralty will devote $9,050,000 to the pur
chase of armor during the coming year
and says* it has no difficulty now in se
curing an adequate supply of the qual
ity desired.
Satisfactory progress has been made
in the experiments with oil fuel and
three old gunboats have been converted
Into tank shins for the storing of oil
in home ports. Extensive provision is
being made to supply oil afloat.
The, construction of two battleships,
four armored cruisers, ten submarine
vessels and fourteen torpedo-boat de
stroyers will bebegun during the pres
ent year.
In submitting the estimates Earl
Selborne, First Lord of the Admiral
ty, said the Admiralty was aware that
the estimates were .large, but Parlia
ment must remember how great was
the responsibility cast upon the Board
of Admiralty in providing the country
with a navy strong enough to sustain a
struggle with the navies of any two
powers arid to insure reasonable secur
ity for- the . " country's vast seaborne
trade and the food supply of the people.

"Hermit Kingdom" Doomed
if Russia Triumphs in
the Present War.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CALL BUREAU, HOTEL BARTON.,
WASHINGTON, Feb. 24.â Korea arid
Japan, have entered into a surprising
alliance. Japan guarantees Korea's in
dependence and integrity.^ She receives
in return the right to operate her mill-*
tary forces at will within the Hermit
Kingdom. That Japan will get the con
sent of the Emperor to fortify Masam
pho. commanding the Straits of Korea,
is considered certain.
The State Department to-day re
ceived its first information of this alli
ance through United States Minister
Allen at Seoul. It came as a surprise
to nearly every one in Washington.
Further details are eagerly, awaited.
This consummation of an alliance Is
generally regarded as the death war
rant of Korean independence if Russia
is victorious in the present war. In
such event Russia doubtless will occupy
Korea and make it a Russian province.
The Emperor of Korea declared neu
trality several weeks ago. The alliance
with Japan nullifies that neutrality.
Russia has already protested to the
powers against the Japanese attack
on the Russian ships in Chemulpo, a
neutral harbor. Count Casslnl. the Rus
sian Embassador, conveyed this protest
to Secretary Hay. The alliance has
been in practical effect for at least a
fortnight. Pavlov,. the Russian Minis
ter at Seoul, was "invited" to leave by
the Japanese. He eventually learned
that Korea could not or would not pro-

tect him, so he proceeded with the lega
tion staff to Shanghai.- Apparently the
Influence of Tl Yong Dt. the famous
Russian protege, over the Emperor of
Korea, has been weakened.
All of the powers-have tacitly recog
nized that Korea would be a part of
the battleground of this war. A deter
mined effort by Korea to maintain her
own neutrality would, howeVer, possi
bly have occasioned a tendency by thÂ«
powers to prolong her independence
after the war. There is much anxiety
to see how Russia's ally. France., will
accept this Oriental alliance against
Russia. Korea is not a strong power,
but it is pointed out that her assist
ance to Japan may^ easily assume sub
stantial proportions. The Japanese are
expected to undertake the control of
the Korean army, which can easily be
recruited up to a strength of 30.000 men.
Officered by Japanese, this force might
be a sufficient menace to Russia to
cause France to protest that the prin
ciple of confining the struggle to the
two- powers, Russia and Japan, was be
ing violated. The note which Hay sent
to the powers indicated that the pur
pose of uniting for the preservation of
China's neutrality was to prevent that
power being involved.
In past times of turmoil at Seoul the
ruler or the power behind the throno
has often been assassinated. Some dip
lomats here cheerfully discuss the pos
sibility of such a fate for the present
Emperor.
FIRE BREAKS OUT IN
FRONT-STREET BUILDING
Three Finns Suffer Loss From Blazo

Fire started last night about 11:40
in a building at the southeast corner
of Clark and Front streets. The
blaze had its origin in the elevator
shaft and was discovered by Officer
McPartland. It was quickly extin
guished by the Fire Department.
The building is a three-story struc
ture, the two upper floors being occu
pied by the firm of Lange. Schooley &
Co., photographic printers, and the
low- floor by G. Pieretti & Co.. com
mission merchants, and A. Guiriani, a
wine dealer. The fire is supposed to
have started from spontaneous com
bustion, induced by some of the chem
icals kept by the photographic firm.
The damage to the building was $500.
Lange, Schooley & Co.'s loss will be in
the neighborhood of $1500, and Pier

DR. PIERCE'S REMEDIES.
Growing Old
Ought not to mean growing weak and
feeble. It does not mean weakness or
feebleness for those who eat with good
appetite and sound digestion. It is of
the utmost importance that old people
should retain the power to digest and
assimilate food which is the sole source
of physical strength. When age briags
feebleness it is generally because of the
failure to assimilate the nutrition con*
tained in food.
Dr. Pierce'a Golden Medical Discovery
cures diseases of the stomach aad other
organs of digestion and enables the per-
fect digestion and assimilation of food.
It invigorates the liver and promote*
general physical well being.

Berkeley Office San Francisco Call,

The Academie des Sciences of France
has conferred a signal honor upon Dr.
W. W. Campbell, director of the Lick
Observatory, by awarding him the La
lande prize for 1903. The Lalande prize
is conferred annually upon a single
astronomer who has distinguished him
self in some way in astronomical
science, either by making an interest
ing celestial discovery, or publishing a
memoir, or achieving something val
uable to astronomy through original
investigation. * In making this award
the committee of the French Academie
publishes the following explanation:
The eommlesion proposes unanimously to>

line of research he haa made Important discov
eries.
He ha* taken up and followed the two prin
cipal linet of duplication of spectrum analysis
of ftarÂ«, namely, thr investigation of their
radial velocity. To him we owe the most
thorourh study of the numerous remarkable
temporary etars of late year.-; he haa been
â¢ blÂ«- to lollow to the la*t stages of th^ir de
cline the meet difficult for observation and to
re^ognixe th*ir more or lew complete transfor

He has also lÂ»-en largely occupied with the
spectra of variable stars and of numerous
etarÂ» exhibiting Individual peculiarrtiee; he
has found a gr^at number of stars which con
tain in their Fpeetra both bripht and dark
lines from the tamt origin and which thus
form an entirely new type. In the investiga
tion cf radial velocities his work is important.
He has discovered about thirty spectroscopic
blnarif* â a larer number than discovered by
any other obÂ«erv*-r. One of these has such
variations of radial velocity as to indicate
two periods, and therefore a triple system.
Dr. Campbell's successful work as
director of the American expedition to
the Indies in 1S98 to observe the eclipse
is also reviewed by the commission
ers, the cnnclusWm being that he is
entitled to be called one of the leading
modern astronomers.

JUDGEiSUSTAIXS.DEMLTRREK
[rBrans & Stranz of Alameda
Lose Case in Which They
Ask $25,000 Compensation
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
HIS Broadway, Feb. 24.
Basingthis findings on a recent de
c!eion handed down by the Supreme
Court, Judge Hall decided to-day that
the Contra Costa Water Company was
not liable Â»o*or damages by fire through
alleged lack of water in the pipes or
failure of hydrants to properly per
form their functions. Upon these
grounds heasustained the demurrer of
the Contra , Costa Water Company to
an action bejgnn by the* firm of Bruns
& Strunz of Alameda to recover $25,000
damages from the water company.
The plaintiffs in the case carry on a
hay and grain business in Alameda. A
fire destroyed their -property, which
they allege was due to the fact that
there- was not a sixty-pound pressure
of water, as required, and that a
hydrant was not in good working order.
As taxpayers they claim they are an
integral part of the body politic with
whom the Contra Cbsta Water Com
pany has a contract^ to supply water,
the failure of which, in their case, they
deemed a breach of that contract, for
which they would 'hold the company
responsible.
A general and specific demurrer was
made to their which the
Judge sustained and at the same time
gave a Judgment for the water com
pany with costs. As precedent for this
he quoted a decision handed down in
the case of ITkiah City against the
UkJah Water Company in which the
Supreme Court holds that a water com
pany is not liable for damages in
curred either by the city or individuals
by fire through alleged lack of water.
SUPREMK COURT DECIDES
AGAIXST THE COLLECTOR
Holds That Interest on Deposits and
Dividends Is Not Part of a
Company's Income.
WASHINGTON, Fetf 24.â Justice
Harlan yesterday delivered the opinion
of the Suprerye Court in the case of the
Spreckels. â¢ Sugar Refining Company
vs. Penrose A. McLain, Collector of
Internal Revenue for the First Dis
trict of Pennsylvania, reversing the
opinion of the United States Court of
Appeals for the Third District. The
action was brought by the. refining
company to recover moneys paid by
it under protest to Collector McLain,
which, it is alleged, had been unlaw
fully exacted under the provisions of
the war revenue act providing for a
tax of one-fourth of 1 per cent on the
gross annual receipts of corporations
whose receipts exceed $250,000 per
annum.
In deciding the case it is held that
this was not a direct but an excise tax
on the business done. The decision of
th^ court below was reversed on the
point as to whether the interest on de
posits and the dividends should be con
sidered as a part of the company's in-
Some. The lower courts held that re
ceipts from those sources should be so
considered, but the Suprem i Court of
the United States took the opposite
view.

times takes three.
It is only by thorough organization

Young 'Porch. Climbers Appear
in Court, but Kef use to Make
Explanations to 3Iagistrate

and Ernest Schultz, boy porch climbers
and burglars, were given their prelim
inary hearing this afternoon and were
held to answer to the Juvenile Court by
Justice of the Peace F. S. Cone. Neither
of .the lads was represented by an at
torney and there were none of their
parents or relatives present in court
during the investigation. Deputy Dis
trict Attorney W. H. L. Hynes com
mented on this fact and asserted that
it was his belief that the fathers and
mothers of the youthful criminals were
grossly negligent. in their parental du
ties and were mainly responsible for
the careers the boys were pursuing.
Rev. Oilman Parker, Miss Gazella
Kower, Harry V. Parratt and Detective
George H. Brown, all of whom assisted
in the capture of the pair of juvenile
burglars after }hey had entered the
residence of M. N. Sheldon last Satur
day, testified. When Schultz was asked
if he desired to say anything in his own
defense he answered: "No; nothing 1
could say would do me any good."
Knox would not put in any defense
and appeared to be well satisfied when
Justice Cone announced that he wÂ«tulil
turn him and his partner in crime over
to the Juvenile Court. Knox is but
13 years of age and has been arrested
numerous times for petty thefts.
Schultz is 14 years of age and since
his arrest has been sulky and reticent.
Both of the young burglars are from
San Francisco, where their parents
reside.

EVENTS IN SOCIETY
OAKLAND. Feb. 24.â In spite of the in
clement weather, the song and organ recital by-
Mrs. Carrie Brown Dexter and Miss Virsinia
de Kremery last evening was well attended, the
large auditorium of the First l'resbytÂ£rian
Church being almost filled with the admirers
of these two well known musicians. Mrs. Dex
ter looked unusually well In a very becoming
pink gown of crepe and lace, and her clear,
delicate soprano voice was never heard to bet
ter advantage. In the brilliant aria from 'â Ri
goletto," "Caro Nome," she was especially
good. "The "Monotone," by Cornelius, was
also artistically done. .Will King, as Mrs.
Dexter's accompanist, did some excellent work.
Miss de Fromery's friends were largely in
evidence last night, and seemed to appreciate
fully her selections on the organ. She was at
great disadvantage in b?ing obliged to play
on a poor instrument, which called for a power
in manipulating that AIlss de Fremery was
equal to only occasionally. Her rendition of
Lemare"s â Barcarolle" and the "Contes d'Av
ril," by Wider, was excellent, and they wery
the most pleasing numbers of a very diflcult
programme. i
Both ladies were the recipients . of many
beautiful flowers. . .
The Starr King art exhibit continues to at
tract a goodly number of visitors every after
noon and evening, although the steady down
pour of rain has kept many at home that would
otherwise, iiave helped to swell the attendance.
Cafienasao ami riazzoni are the largest ex
hibitors. The two large canvases by Ca<>
naseo, "Summer" and "A Gray Day," are
splendid examples of the versatility of that
well known artist, the warmth and brightness
cf the one contrasting vividly with the dripping
trees and gray sky of the other.
Xavler Martinez has four weird pictures,
breathing loneliness and desolation, that have
attracted much attention, and, as usual wher
ever Sidney Yards has a landscape hung, an
admiring group is always to bÂ»" seen.
Chapel Judson's Monterey Cliffs are good.
â¢ â¢ â¢
The ladies of the AVest Oakland Home Asso
ciation will give a house vafmlng at the home
next Saturday to celebrate the completion of

All of the T'p-to-Date Li

THEIR WANTS CONSIDERED
Notes From the Public Book
Shelves of Alamedat Peta
luma, Spokane and Ventura
This is the children's age in the
library. Prior to ten or twelve years
ago chi!dr*?o were not welcomed in pub
lic libraries, but now every library
blessed with progressive spirit makes
provision for their presence. The
smaller libraries set apart a portion
of the library room for the "children's
corner"; the larger libraries establish
separate rooms J"or their u*e awd pro
vide special attendants who give their
whole time to this department. In the
best equipped libraries there are little
low chairs, tables and bookcases; at
some of the tables checkers, backgam
mon and puzzles are found; pictures
hang upon the walls and statuary adds
grace to the rewms. It is exceedingly
interesting: to watch the little people
who come trooping Sn after school
hours to cet a coveted book or with
Mhers to listen to that unfailing won
der to a child â a story. Many of these
children come from homes where books
ar<> never owned.
On ihÂ«Â» tables the children find their
old favorites, the Youth's Companion,
St. Nicholas and other Interesting mag
azines. The very little ft/Iks are not
forgotten, for en the shelves may be
seen volumes of fairy talcs, fables, leg
ends, nature stories, simple poetry, sto
ries of travel, history ar.d life. Then
for the older boys and j?irls there is a
wealth of stimulating elementary books
upon electricity, mechanics, forestry,
insect, bird and fish life, with choice
little works of history, poetry, travel,
fiction, art and literature, not overlook
ing that class which appeals to every
resolute boy â the books of adventure,
a::d daring. Reference works of easy
understanding are made accessible to
thp student children.
At the present time nearly 40 per
rent of the book borrowers of the pub
iivj libraries throughout the country are
children, the proportion of boys and
pirls being nearly equal. It is almost
needless to say that the selecting- of
children'* books for such wide and con
stant use calls for the finest and most
Thoughtful care.
LJBRABITS HIGHEST SERVICE.
The supreme object of this work for
i hildren is to encourage a* taste for
the b^st reading and through the ideals
thus created to help the boy to become
a manly man, to help the girl to be
'â¢ome a womanly woman. No other
part of library development in its early
conditions has proved more responsive;
no other reveals a future of brighter
promise. A distinguished educator
v.Â«ic** his estimate of this labor, say
ing: "The best, the highest service
that can possibly be rendered is the
Eerrfce and the ministry to childhood."
From the Oakland public library
< ->mes word that Mrs. Edward Booth
has given the library $25 to be ex
panded for children's books. This gift
is hailed as the first one of a long line
of donations that are hoped for.
Brilliant prospects attend the plans
for the children's room in the library
building to be built in Berkeley. Be
sides the great concert of 3000 children'^
\ oices to be held in the Greek Amphi
theater in the university grounds to
i-iipe funds for the purchase of chil
dren's books, the Town and Gown Club
has agreed to finish and furnish thy
children's room in oak at an expense
- l $350. The high school and grammar
school teachers also intend to have a
share in the good work of beautifying
this room by the purchase of pictures
and statuary.
CHILDREN'S STORY HOUR.
A new departure is to be made in
the public library of Great Falls, Mont.
Every Friday afternoon of the next two
months there will be held at 4:30 o'ciocl:
il "children's story hour." The fln>t
series of stories will be taken from the
legends of "King Arthur, "Â» to be given
by the librarian and one of her assist
ants. Plans similar to this have proved
exceedingly popular in many Eastern
libraries. So important, indeed, is the
art of telling stories to children re
carded in the training school for chil
dren's libraries in the Carnegie Library
of Pittsburg that Miss Shedlock of Lon
don, a proficient in this art. has Just
given ten lectures. there upon this sub
ject. Regular instruction In story tell
ing to children has for several years
formed part of the course of this school.
The trustees of the Alameda. Public

SIGNS OF WAR
AT THE FERRY
Manager Rank of North Shore
Railway Objects to Land
in? of Steamers at New Slip
DANGER OF THE POSITION
Steamboat Captains Sijrn State
ment That Life, Property and
Reputation Would Be in Peril
There ?re signs of war on the water
front. \V. M. Rank, general manager
of the North Shore Railway Company,
refuses to comply with the order of
the State Board of Harbor Commis
sioners, assigning the steamers of his
company to the new slip A. which was
recently constructed by the board. The
manager holds that it would be ex
ceedingly difficult under- conditions of
wind and tide for a large sidewheel
steamer to make a landing there. His
Judgment in this respect is sustained
by a statement signed by quite a num
ber of steamboat captains.
The following communication was
presented to the Harbor Commission
at the session yesterday afternoon: ,
SAN FRANCISCO. Feb. 22. lÂ»f>4.
Ti> the Honorable Boerd of Harbor Oomm!*-
Fioners: t\>. thÂ» und^rslimed, captain* of the
Kouthe.-n Pacific. .California North\v*>*iern.
North Eterc. Santa Fe and Oakland Transit
ftrry syftpnn;. are informed that the recently
constructed Flip west of No. 1 ts to be assigned
to the ferry syftem. We respectfully protest
acainÂ«t the above a*sisnmÂ»rkt. and we submit
our reasons /or doing so to your honorable
board.
Owlnir to the proximity of the slip, to the
riÂ«*r adjacent, under certain conditions of the
wind and lide it will be exceedingly difficult
and hazardous to meke a landing. For in-
Ftar.ce. assuming a southerly or southeasterly
wind and strong ebb tide, it muÂ«t be plain to
you that it will be very hard to clear the pier
adjacent ar.d failure to do so would result in
injury to life and property and to our reputa
tions. With either a strong: ebb or flood tide
it will be no easy matter to fret in or out. In
frgpy weather the sltuaticn will also he very
dangerous. Going at slow spepd. the chances
arÂ»> very rtrong against our making a landing.
We have heard the opinions of many cap
tains navigating in the bay, and they are
unanimous in condemning the slip as being to
tally inadequate for a large side whÂ»Â«l
Ftfamf. If four dolphins were driven beyond
th<- end of the short side of the slip they
might rctteva th* situation somewhat. As It
is. we protest against being compelled to use
il slip which in our opinion and the opinion
of ether experts is unsafe, owing to its position
and shape, and expose ourselves to the risk of
injuring life and rroperty and being held re
sponsible for it.
The communication is signed by C.
A. Johnson, John A. Mathieson. Wil
liam Bisco, Charles Bagge, A. Pollson,
J. J. Jones, William Fredrlckson, C. P.
Lauritzen. W. W. Rogers, John Leale,
H. A. Hyde, John Lewis, C. J. Ander
son and Richard Bradley.
Chief Engineer Norton advised the
board that the occupancy of the new
slip was necessary in order to carry
out the work of reDairing other slips.
Slip No. 4, occupied by the Santa Fe,
was greatly in need of repair. The pro
posed assignment of the Xorth Shore
was only temporary. The statement
that the position was unsafe for side
wheel steamers was not considered
sound, as stern-wheelers had no
trouble in making a landing there.
The Commissioners considered that
the expenditure of $500 to put in a dol
phin was not required. It was re
marked in tfVe discussion that the cap
tains of the ferry systems would sign
anything. The assertion was made
that the Xorth Shore, not desiring to
occupy tho slip, was causing all the
trouble. The chief wharfinger was di
rected to carry out the orders of the
board in making the temporary assign
ment, so that the work of repairing
other slips could proceed at once.
The Commissioners authorized the
renewal of insurance on State prop
erty. The whole amount of insurance
carried is 5675,000. The policies now
expiring were written three years ago,
and the renewals will cover the same
length of time. Under the law the
State is to receive the commission or
dinarily allowed to brokers.
Commissioners Spear, Kirkpatrick
and Mackenzie attended the session of
the board yesterday. There were no
fresh developments in the news stand
controversy. Steps were taken to clear
the way to the approaches of the new
Santa Fe bridge across Channel street
at Third. Occupants of that por
tion of the street which is .under
the Jurisdiction of the Harbor Com
mission pay no attention to the city
Board of Public Works. They simply
smile and ray nothing when Casey and
ir-'chmitz tell them to move on.
feet square will give light to the. center
of the building. A sum of $500 or $600
Is being raised by popular subscription,
in addition to the Carnegie gift of
$12,500. that the structure may bÂ» com
pleted according to desired plans.
The suggestion" has been made that
public libraries which receive a gift for
a building should not change their
names in order to perpetuate the do
nor's name. An appropraite tablet in
the vestibule or hall will afford perm
anent recognition of the gift. It is a
well-known though sometimes forgot
ten fact that schools, colleges and
libraries which assume the name of a
liberal founder fail to receive other do
nations.
The Emmanuel Episcopal Church of
Nevada City intends to reopen its libra
ry and amusement rooms, established
two years ago. Games, of many kinds,
chess boards and billiard tables afford
much interest to the young people of
the town. The regular occupation of
the rooms will be on Saturday even
ings.
Ventura has recently built a new
town hall at a cost of $5000. The upper
floor is occupied exclusively by the pub
lic library, having two rooms, oach 25x
4S feet. The front room is used as a
reading-room and has files of newspa
pers and magazines, while the rear
room contains the books and general
equipment of the library. The annual
Income is a little more than $1000.
Miss Florence Vandever is the libra
rian. ' The Native Daughters' Improve
ment Club has given $25 to the library
trustees for the purchase of new books.
PUBLIC SPIIUTED WOMEN".
San Dimas. a village in Los Angele3
County, owes much to the public spirit
of its-women. A public hall and library
has recently been built and paid for by
their efforts. They are now preparing
the volumes of the library jfor circula
tion. . Mrs. L. A. Baker, recently re
moved from Pasadena, has presented
the new library with 400 books of stand
ard selections.
THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL". THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 25. 1904.
TO ELECTRIZE
A STEAM ROAD
United Railroads Will Convert
California-Street Line Into
an Overhead Trolley System
POLICEMEN ON CARPET
Failure to Report Illegal Lay
ing of Sidewalk Results in
Trial for Neglect of Duty
The United Railroads yesterday filed
a petition with the Board of Public
Works for permission to reconstruct the
present steam road on California street,
Thirty-second avenue, Lake street and
through private lands to or near the
Cliff House into an electric road.
In the petition General Manager
Chapman states that the corporation
desires to maintain a better service on
the line of* road described and to that
end desires to erect poies along the
route thereof with all the necessary
wires, curves, turnouts and the like for
the purpose of operating and connect
ing the road by electric power with an
overhead electric system.
Accompanying the petition is a plat
showing the route of the road, the style
and character of the poles . to be
erected and the character of the con
templated overhead construction work.
The petition was referred to the City
Engineer for an early report.
The board decided that change of
grades on J street. Fifth and Sixth ave
nues on Parnassus Heights would be of
public benefit and recommended to the
Board of Supervisors that the improve
ment be carried out. J. C. McKinstry
and Dr. E. L. Merritf; representing the
Sutro estate, unsuccessfully renewed
their objections to the change of grades,
which they will now have to make to
the Supervisors.
General Manager Chapman of the
United Railroads notified the board
that the defects in the pavement on
Third street between Mission and Ber
ry will receive immediate attention.
Chief of Police Wittman reported that
a plank sidewalk was laid without a
permit on the northeast corner of
Stockton and Green streets and that
Officers Brodt, Wren, Fowle and Ward
were "derelict in their duty in not re
porting the same; for which they will
appear before the Police Commission on
charges of neglect of duty. Commis
sioner Casey thought the property
owner who laid the sidewalk should be
punished instead ofthe policemen and
he and Commissioner Woodward had
a short verbal tilt over the matter.
A. Ruef, F. S. Shadburne and F. Ma
rinl appeared before the board in sup
port of petitions that Dupont street be
tween Vallejo and Filbert be re
paved. They stated that the pave
ment had not been repaired since 1862.
The board thought It could pave one
block at once and if sufficient funds
are available the four blocks will be
Improved.
The board took under advisement the
petition of the North Central Improve
ment Association that certain blocks
paved with cobblestones in the down
town district be repaved. Commission
er Gasey said that the improvement of
the blocks was incorporated in the pro
posed bond issue.
Bids for the repaving of Dupont
street from California to Sacramento
were received from Flinn & Treacy and
the City Street Improvement Company
and the contract wil be awarded to
morrow.
George McDougald was appointed ce
ment finisher to succeed E. F. Bailey,
removed.
Champions Street Flower Venders.
A number of storekeepers on
Kearny street sent a signed protest
to the Supervisors yesterday against
what it -terms "the unprecedented In
terference of the Board of Works in
driving the flower venders from the
public streets," and urging that the
board named reconsider its action.
Bankrupt Clerk.
Charles Orr, a clerk residing in Sac
ramento, filed a petition in Insolvency
yesterday in the United- States Dis
trict Court. He owes $3785 and has
$3035 assets, of which $2985 are debts
due on open account.
In Glendora, Los Angeles County, a
public library has just been opened by
the exertions of the Athena Club.
The Spokane, Wash., Library Board
has accepted the decision of Professor
Ware, the architectural expert of Co
lumbia University, to whom the nine
plans for the Carnegie library building
were referred for his choice. The ap
proved plan calls for a two-story struc
ture of stone and pressed brick, with
two reading-rooms and the reference
room on the main floor. The second
floor is to contain the newspaper room,
the cataloguer's room and several
others as yet unassigned. The chil
dren's room is to be in the basement.
A distinctive feature of the design is
the position of the stack room for the
books, which is placed in a wing and is
lighted on both sides. This affords the
marked advantage of allowing exten
sion when demanded by the growth of
the library. In commenting upon one
other of the submitted plans, Professor
Ware observes of the dome that it is
an expensive, useless and undesirable
feature, which may well be replaced by
a skylight. The cost of this building is
not to exceed $62,000.
"Mutual Helpfulness" was the theme
of Librarian J. C. Rowell at a recent
meeting of the Library Association of
California. Specialization was shown
to be the need of the librarian of to
day, consequently librarians should
freely place their special knowledge at
the service of others of the profession.
The speaker maintained that in no
other profession was such helpfulness
more liberally extended. Inter-library
loans were commended. The State Uni
versity library borrows books from
New England and lends Its. own vol
umes all over the Pacific Coast. A
great central storehouse of books was
advocated for the future to prevent un
necessary duplication of works* which
are wanted only occasionally, such
works to be loaned as wanted through
out Its territory. Twenty-five new
members joined the Library Associa
tion in January.

union label on manufactured products,
as well as in legislation, which at last
is the only hope of just conditions for
labor.
"We criticize as unfair, illegal and
unjust those decisions of the courts
declaring labor laws unconstitutional,
and we demand a constitutional amend
ment authorizing legislation requiring
the States, municipalities and public
franchise owning corporations, their
contractors and sub-contractors, to pay
workmen the prevailing rates of wages,
and that upon public works eight hours
shall constitute a day's labor, and we

INSTRUCTIVE STUDIES

Slang â Its Abuses.
BT MISS ADELINE KNAPP.
(Formerly â¢â¢ittor -The Household,' 1 New
York; author of "The Boy and the Baron,
â¢Thf Story of the Philippines." "Upland
Pastures." Â«tc.)
â¢ Copyright; 1904. by Joseph B. Bowles.)
Tbe average girl is a composite of
many contradictory influences. She is J
suayed by many varying influences '
and moved upon by moods and experi- ;
e-nees nev:, untried and unadjusted. I
the has not yet got her perspective in j
life. Perhaps this is one reason why.
Just at the time when she begins toÂ»;
take on little oxtra politenesses and ele- j
gancies of manner toward her mates, \
she also begins to think slang clever i
and expressive. She is at pains to ac- j
quire the vocabulary of slang and to j
introduce it into her conversation, be- j
cause of a mistaken idea that it means
more than ordinary' English can ex
press. I wonder if it does.
Poverty of thought and of language
is a far more shameful thing than pov- j
erty of purse. It argues stupidity, as
poverty of purse cannot. Not every
body has frep access to wealth, but
every intelligent human being has fres â 
access to that great storehouse of j
vords called the English languagf. â¢
There are 200.000 of these words. The
English tongue is the richest in the !
world in eynonyms and in words which
are nearly synonyms, but which ex- j
prÂ«Â»ss varying shades of the same idea.
Tet of this vast wealth the great mass
of educated people in this country is
content to put to use but a paltry four
or five hundred: It is as though a man
â with unlimited wealth at his command
should be content to use merely a few ;
dollars now and then; to live in a nar
row, mean way. letting his wealth iiÂ»
idle, not because he was a miser, but
because he was too stupid to realize
its power.
Now there is no one thing outeide of
ignorance which has such a limiting
influence on the use of English as
s Inng. This reads like a paradox. Most
people think of slang as a more than
usually free and picturesque use of
language. They think that a man wh-j
u?es a great many new or quaint slang
words or phrases enriches his vocabu
lary thereby. Let us consider the mat
ter for a moment.
The user of slang is always inclined
to the constant use of certain "pet
phrases, whirh, while they are in fa
vor, are made to do a great deal of
extra work. Here, for instance, is an
ectual conversation to which I listened
not long ago. The speakers were a
girl and a young man. both university
students, who sat behind me in a
train. They were evidently talking of
college athletics. The girl spoke first:
"<l.'s an Al runner, isn't he?" she
asked.
"Well, I should remark; ain't he
just?" was the reply.
"Did you see the midterm field
work?" the girl asked next.
"I should remark. G. ran in great
shape, didn't he? L. was good enough,
but G. â well, I should remark!"
There was a pause and then the
talk turned to more serious matters.
"I'm looking at psychology," the girl
paid. ("Looking at" is collegese for
giving special attention to.)
"Are you? I got mine all done (!)
laFt year. I tell ypu I'm thankful
Fome! There are some things I can
fe*Â» the s^nse of, but psychology!
Well, I should remark!"
"It is hard," she admitted.
"Hard? Well. I should remark!"
We reached my station and ( I left
the train, much edified by what I had
ovprhenrd. Doubtless the higher edu
cation was doing much for those young
people, but does any one suppose that
the youth really expressed himself by
that inane reiteration of a phrase in
itself inane and meaningless? Yet
only a short time ago a bright, clever
girl, whose education advantages have
r-fcf n unusual, contended with me, seri
ously, for the value of slang. "Could
anything," she said, "be more per
fectly expressive than the phrase
â¢pulling his leg'?"
Expressive of what? I asked a
number of people what it expressed
to them, and here are some of their
replies: â¢
"Why â why â to work him." (Three
gave this answer.)
"To come a 'con game' on him."
"Why â you know â why, to draw
him down."
"To get the Zteet of him.**
"To hoodwink him."
Nearly every one of those I asked
found it necessary to resort to further
Flang to define the phrase, and nearly
every one had a different ' shade of
meaning for it.
That last is really a serious flaw in
slang as a medium of expression.
Nearly every one hag his own idea of
what a given phrase means, but the
idea of the hearer may be quite dif
ferent from that of the user. Any
one can prove this by choosing some
bit of current slang and asking ten
or a dozen different persons what it
means.
Each time we use a slang phrase
we set aside r correct word or phrase
which belongs in use and by bo much
we limit our power of expression. A
limited vocabulary means a limited
mind. Words actually- bring ideas in
their train. Every new set of words
acquired brings a new mental outlook.
One reason why the English language
has euch a comprehensive vocabulary
is that the English-speaking people
have been great wanderers. English
men have sailed over seas to foreign
lands and brought back new .words
with a host of new ideas dependent
upon them.
Whole vistas of knowledge spread
and b<*ckon before -us when we turn
over the leaves of the dictionary and
note the sources of many of bur com
mon words. Shawl, camphor, torna
do, ship, street and harbor are words
of every day use enougrh, yet there was
a time when they were new in Eng
lish, when their very sound brought
new knowledge to be explained and
acquired. Think of the host of new
ideas that have come to us with new.
words from Cuba, Porto Rico, Hawaii
and the Philippines, from China and
South Africa.
But we of to-day, do not need to
sail away to foreign lands for new
words to give us new ideas. We have
but to open the dictionary and run a
Jlngrer down its columns until we come
to an unfamiliar combination of let
ters.' What does it mean? Where
did it come from? How did it get
into our language? Usually we shall
not get beyond the first of these ques
tions without gaining a wider outlook.
The dictionary is a perfect gold mine
for ideas; the gold we flnd in it has
the charm of all virgin gold, with this
in addition, that not only does it bear
no mint stamp, but we may take the
pure material and out our own stamp
on it.
The Complete Kitchen.
BY CHRISTINE TERHUNE HEHRICK.
(Author of "In City Tents." "Liberal Living
on Narrow Means," etc.)
(Copyright. 18<M, by Joseph B. Bowtes.)
Readers of Mrs. Whitney's books will
not have forgotten that In one of them
she makes a woman speak of her bottle
of household ammonia as "her kitchen
maid." That name has been gratefully
applied to ammonia by many a woman
who has seen the magical effects a
few spoonfuls of it will have in cut
ting the grease in pot or frying pan,
or in cleansing a soiled silk, or in bright
ening silver or glass. If one could
choose but one kitchen help, the am
monia bottle would surely be that one.
There are helps besides this. On the
same principle that moves her to buy
washing powders and fluids and pastes
the housekeeper should provide herself
with all the mechanical labor-saving
appliances she can secure, if they real- j
ly save labor. For this name is often
a misnomer. The kind of utensil that ;
economizes time for the worker and
turns out a poorly preiared product :
that is unsatisfactory to the people
who are to eat it or to use it is an
extravagance in the long run â or in the â¢
short run, either. Such as these are
one or twoâ meat choppers that have
been put upon the market, which seem
to crush the Juice from the meat they
chop and turn it out a powdery, taste
less mass. Such also are certain pat
ented egg beaters, which In frothing
or thickening the eggs make so close
grained a product that the lightness of
effect for which the eggs were to be
used is entirely lacking.
Meat choppers and egg beaters there
are, however, that are among the
housewife's chlefest blessings, and in
addition to these there are other con
veniences, some cheap, some more cost-,
ly, which save her time and strength.
As many of these as she can afford she
should have in her kitchen or pantry.
1 know of nothing that is more an
noying to a housekeeper than a dearth
of the commonplace, every day kitchen
utensils. Yet I have known persons of
wealth who were poor in such things.
I have been in the pantries of women
in good circumstances where the flour
sifter was rusted and broken, where
the one strainer must be used for cof
fee, soup or .jollies, where there was
but one frying pan for all uses of saute
ing and boiling or frying of any sort,
and where there was a single broiler
to serve for fish and meat â a broiler
which was also- used as a toasting rack.
In these kitchens I have round such
helps as a vegetable press or a lemon
squeezer, or an apple corer or a suffi
ciency of mixing bowls and spoons ab
solutely lacking. It is like asking for
bricks without providing straw to ex
pect a cook to do good and brisk work
when s=he has to make shifts to take
the place of inexpensive utensils. These
things are not costly, and there is no
reason except carelessness or positive
poverty why there should not be
enough bowls and cups for mixing,
knives fc-r meat and vegetables, cups
for measuring and the like in even
a tolerably well furnished pantry and
j kitchen.
| The lists that are given for the neces
sary furnishing of the kitchen are
sometimes discouraging. The woman
who can have but one table, even al
though that be a double decker, and
must supplement the lack of such space
by a hinged* shelf over the one table
she has. is likely to be annoyed and
discouraged when she is told that a
I marble slab is a requisite for the man
ufacture of good pastry. It is a help
undoubtedly, but it is like a good many
other things of the sort.
"I have been housekeeping for thirty
years." I heard a woman say the other
day. She had always been a hospita
ble soul and a notable housekeeper, and
her table was a synonym for good liv
ing. "I flatter myself," she contin
i ued, "that I am a tolerable cook,
and that the dishes which come
on my table are fairly attractive.
I have never owned a marble topped
pastry table or a pastry bag or tube,
or a set of dariole molds or a frying
kettle or half a dozen other things that
I am always told are essential to good
housekeeping. They are all very nice,
but I have managed to get along with
out them very comfortably."
So have a good many other women.
None the less, many of these things
are a great help in dainty cookery. But
if there is a choice between these and
plenty of the plainer things, the latter
should be chosen. I have already
spoken of the necessity of enough mix
ing bowls and cups. There should be
dishes or nappies in which to put away
food, cooked or uncooked, so that the
dishes kept for the table should not be
used for this purpose. There should
also be a half-pint measuring cup and
a graduated quart measure, two. or
three, double boilers of different sizes,
large sharp knives for meat or fish or
bread, and smaller and equally sharp
knives for cutting and peeling vegeta
bles and for removing the meat from
the bones of a joint or fowl.

RUSSIA'S COMPLAINT.
THE Russian Government has addressed to the pow
ers a diplomatic note impeaching Japan for violat
ing international law. The serious charge is for vio
lating the neutrality of Korea by landing troops in that
empire. Unless Japan could make' such use of Korea,
she would have no land base for her military operations.
The complaint comes with bad grace from* Russia, after
violating the neutrality of China by occupying Manchu
ria as her land base, and erecting on Chinese soil mili
tary- camps and fortifications during the time in which
she agreed with the Western nations to prepare for evac
uating - Manchuria. Last year she promised the United
States to observe her agreement to evacuate on October
8. But that date found her increasing her forces on
Chinese soil and busy usurping the civil administration
of Manchuria, against the protest of, China and -in viola
tion of her word to the allies in the Boxer war.
It is said that France sympathizes with Russia in her
view of the case. This is probably a play in the game
going on between France and Germany to court the
favor of Russia. - If Germany insinuate herse^ into the
place now held by France as a Russian ally, France will
be isolated on the Continent. But it must be remem
bered that England and Japan are joined in the same"
form of alliance as fchat between France and Russia, arid
if France go so far as to give aid, even diplomatically, to
the Czar, England may be expected to. go. just as far
with the Mikado.
The rest of Russia's complaint runs to Japan's act of
war at Port Arthur, in advance of a formal declaration.
It is not the first time /hat has occurred. We did it in
the Mexican war, and had an action at arms in advance
of a formal declaration by Congress. It may be said,
too, that every day that Russian troops have remained
in Manchuria after the date agreed upon for evacuation
was an act of war. Such continued occupancy is under
stood by every Government to have been a warlike
menace, directed against the independence and exist
ence of Japan.
Russia's note is published concurrently with a boast
that she will wipe out the Japanese armies next August.
If she expect that in such event she will also have per
mission to do as she pleases with Japan she is probably
mistaken, for it is inconceivable that the world will as
sent to her absorption of that empire. There is no in
tention anywhere to permit Russia to'become the dom
inating power of the planet, as she would be with Japan,
China and Korea absorbed into her system. In this the
United States is equally interested with the other West
ern nations. Such expansion of Russian power would
practically drive us out of the Pacific, and while it is not
probable that we would make war in the matter, it is
probable that we would join a concert of such Western
nations as desire to preserve a just balance in the world's
trade, and prevent the spread of the execrable scheme of
government represented in the Russian polity. .
We stand at present on Secretary Hay's note, en
forcing respect for the neutrality and territorial integ
rity of China. It is a most important action, and makes
a foundation for future action in protection of our inter
ests in the Pacific and in the trade of China.
American public opinion and view of the morals of the
Eastern conflict are exactly uttered in the many pulpits
in this country, in which the subject has been discussed.
In not a single case has the Russian side met with any
favor. The superior civilization* of Japan is recoginized,
as it should be, and the superior system of her govern
ment has not escaped indorsement. Japan has a high
degree of popular government,' with parliamentary insti
tutions and a perfect system of jurisprudence founded
on the 'common law. Americans wilt not see these insti
tutions submerged in the brutal autocracy of Russia.
In a discussion at the State Conference of Charities
and Corrections an opinion seemed to prevail the other
day that the City and County .Hospital of San Fran
cisco.is the worst institution of its kind on earth. This
appears to be a particularly severe and unjust criticism
on the rest of the earth. San Francisco is the only spot
on the globe, at least of that part of it that claims civil
ization as an experience, which would tolerate a hospital
like that on Potrero avenue.
TWO THOUSAND WOMEN.
TWO THOUSAND women were represented in â¢ a
recent gathering of delegates from women's clubs
in Sacramento, having for- their purpose the organi
zation of a women's council. The purpose of assembling
was duly accomplished. In addition to the clubs there
were representatives of foreign missionary societies,
ladies' church aid societies, Good Templar lodges, the
Ladies' Hebrew Benevolent Society, the Ladies' Auxil
iary of the Young Men's Christian Association, the Oak
Park Women's Christian Temperance Union, the Court
land Farmers' Club, the Kingsley Art Club, the Ladies'*
Choral Society, the Catholic Ladies' Relief Society, the
Ladies' Auxiliary of the Synagogue and /various other
organizations. \&^
The body that was formed by agreement on the part
of the- delegates .will be known as the Women's Council
for the Improvement of the City, and County of Sacra
mento. The purposes are declared to be to bring the
various associations of women into closer relations
through an organic union. No affiliating association
loses its independence or sacrifices its aims, principles or
methods. The general and controlling idea is to get to
gether for the benefit of Sacramento. Two thousand
women can do much for Sacramento or for. a city of
much greater size if they work harmoniously together.
The large number of women interested in this -latest
movement indicates that there is an awakening of civic
spirit in the. capital city of the^ State that portends some
earnest attempts at betterment.
How are the women going to better Sacramento? The
answer contains some interesting points. Departments
of study are to meet once a month, at which problems
will be considered and digested. The council will meet
quarterly and the departments for study and work must
report every quarter to the council. By inference the
names of the different departments that are provided for
by the constitution that has been adopted for the coun
cil point out generally the immediate purposes of the
affiliation.
There will be an improvement league, to include road
improvement and all work for the betterment of city and
county not assigned to any other department. There
will be a department to aid in the advancement-of the
public schools, a department of organized charities and
another of moral reform. Each department elects
its own officers. If any department undertakes 'a public
work concerning which there are well defined differences
of opinion, the proposition must obtain the sanction of
the executive council. . ' >\ '
This is a brief outline of the large movement that is
interesting all the women in Sacramento County and
has elements of interest Jor all women in California.
Animated by a desire for the "public- good and working
with single aim to that" end," 1 the two thousand Sacra
mento women deserve well of the community in which
they^ live, and serve as shining examples to other
women wherever they may dwell. , â¢
In an address recently delivered ~ before an Oakland
audience Judge B. B. Lindsey of Denver urged ear
nestly that the State assume the attitude of a parent in
the correction of criminal children. The learned jurist
did not emphasize the fact, however, that criminal chil
dren among normal youths, is a more dangerous condi
tion to society than criminal children among their ab
normal elders. It is better, perhaps, to destroy a dis
eased unit than to infect a community.
INTERSTATE COMMERCE.
HAVING drawn a bill so incomprehensible that it
was reported to be what it is not, Mr. Hearst now
girds at the press for taking it to be as reported.
It was reported that he had introduced a' bill "to amend
imprisonment out of the penal' sections of the interstate
commerce and anti-trust laws. He declares now- that he
wished to amend imprisonment into both. That is to
say, he wants the interstate commerce law as it was
originally, with imprisonment among the penalties for its
violation.
' As it was known that the imprisonment feature was
considered obnoxious during labor strikes which inter
fered with interstate commerce,' so it was concluded, in
some quarters, that Mr. Hearst was aiming to secure in
the law such a penalty as would be ineffective in such
cases. He is now on record, however, as- desiring to
confront all violators with the damp prison cell, and if
the penalty is enforced equally, it is\inobjectionable. It
will be a proper precaution, however, to submit his bi\l
to a committee on style and statement, to the end that
it may be purged of complexity and that its cloudy state
ment may be cleared up.
The interstate commerce law has been productive of
much good, but is still lacking in very necessary fea
tures. The commission has no direct and original
power to enforce its judgments. It must go to a judicial
.court to effect this, where all issues are subject to dilatory
motions and vexatious dela3's. While preserving a
proper regard for all rights involved, such a law should
be freed from the possibility of great delays, inasmuch
as the merit of it consists largely in its "prompt enforce
ment. There are those who believe it within the power
of Congress to confer judicial powers upon the commis
sion, making it a court of first instance and original
jurisdiction, with power of finality over some of the
issues that come before it, unless they involve constitu
tional questions which may be appealed.
Since the organization of the Department of CÂ°m~
merce with its Bureau of Corporations, the merely exec
utive functions of the Interstate Commerce Commission
may undergo absorption into the new department, in
creasing the need of clothing it with duties more' spe
cifically judicial in their character.
/The transportation interests have found the commis
sion to be a material assistance in the adjustment of
their relations to each other, since that which they are
unable to agree to among themselves is readily adopted
by all when decided by the tommission. Its field was
untried ground when it began operations, and is so vast
and intricate as to justify the care and deliberation with
which it has' proceeded. It should not be clothed with
unnecesary powers or those impossible of use, and the
closer it is approximated to judicial methods the more
service "may be expected from it. It is the intention of
the law to prevent restrictions upon commerce between
xhe States, either by transportation companies or by
those who interfere with their business.
The policy of our scheme of government .is to secure
free and unrestricted trade between the States. This
policy is powerful enough to prevent embargoes on the
sale and use of lawful property produced in one State
and shipped into another. To illustrate, the Legislature
of California cannot pass a law forbidding the use of
lumber from Oregon, or of encaustic tiles from New
Jersey, or iron hollowware from New York. What is
forbidden in that respect to the State is not permitted to
individuals, or combinations of individuals. If the State
attempt it the courts void the statute, and the penal
clauses of the interstate commerce law cannot be ap
plied. The case is different, however, with individuals,
who can for such an act be imprisoned as soon as Mr.
Hearst amends the jail back into the law. *
The effect of restricting trade between the States of
the same country is shown in Mexico, where it has been
possible for each State to have its own tariff upon the
products of any other State. This prevents the free cir
culation of commerce, restrains production and creates
a narrow provincialism that is antagonistic to progress.
What an interstate tariff does in Mexico will be done
here, if it.be permitted to any one to forbid the use in
one State of the products of another, no matter what the
pretext may be.
As the constitution commits to Congress the regula
tion of these matters, there is still an opening for much
wholesome legislation which should be had without the
taint of 'prejudice, demagogy, or class interest. It should
apply in its regulations and its penalties impartially to
all and should be administered in the same spirit of
equality. The transportation facilities of the 'country
have been prime factors in its development, and those
who administer them have the greatest interest in the
development of the resources Which make their opera
lion profitable. If they are not wisely selfish by aiding
such development, it is the duty of the law to make
American shippers are justly agitated to know whether
or not our foodstuffs, now on the way to either or both
of the belligerent powers of the Orient, are to be consid
ered contraband of war. Th.e safest solution of the diffi
culty perhaps is to insist upon a cash payment in ad
vance, and let the other fellow trouble himself about the
uncertain question of delivery in these strenuous times
of conflict on the high seas.
European dispatches indicate that Russia is deter
mined to send her Black Sea fleet to the front. One
would think that St. Petersburg would see the wisdom of
having a few fighting ships left after the cruel war is
over. If there is a nation on earth that should not carry
all her eggs in one basket surelyit is Russia. .
I Even. Spain sees in the Far Eastern war. the dread po
tential elements of a world conflict. When Spain can
see anything affecting her own" interests it is time for
the others in the, family of' nations to be up and doing.
TALK OF THE TOWN
AND TOPICS OF THE
TIMES
'His Adventure.
"How is it. Uncle Tom. that you
never married?" was the query put tu
a bright-eyed little old fellow, the guest
of a family In the Mission, a few nights
ago. The blue eyes of the old man lost
their brightness and on his face .came
a frown. He looked so worried for a
minute or two that the questioner was
about to apologize, fearing that she
had Inadvertantly touched upon a sore
spot In the life of Uncle Tom. But the
gloomy look lasted only for a minute.
Then the blue eyes became bright
again and twinkled merrily. His Hpa
parted in a smile and with a chuckle
he said, "I did, once."
With exclamations of surprise the
family gathered about the old man.
He had always been known as a kindly
old bachelor, fond of company and
cheerful at all times, free from every
care, who had gone through life with
out ever having been a victim of the
tender passion.
"Let me see," said the old fellow. "It
was more than" fifty years ago. I was
then a young fellow, full of life, an.l
like all young fellows, fond of a Joke
or a hoax. Well, of all the girls I
knew, and I knew a lot. I can tell you.
there was not one who excited a warm
er feeling than friendship. One day
I thought I would be very funny and
inserted an advertisement in the paper
containing the announcement that a
young man of good habits, fairly well
to-do and not bad looking, wanted a
wife. I got about a thousand replies.
I answered them all, generally in my
reply stating that I did not think the
applicant and the â  advertiser would br
congenial mates. From some I got
scorching replies that made me feel a
little nervous.
"One in particular wrote to me ami
told me all sorts of things about myself
that I did not relish because I did not
think they were* true. It was from a
woman in Ohio, who said that she felt
eo certain that she would be the select
ed one that after answering my 'ad'
she had sold her little farm and held
herself ready to fly to the arms of the
young man with good habits, fair
wealth and some good looks. Well, she
must have flown, for the very day I
got her answer she arrived at my shop
In the little Michigan town where I
was living. Somehow or other she con
vinced me that I was a villain of the
deepest dye and that thejjnly way I
could maintain a position in decent so
ciety was to marry her. I did that
afternoon. What I went through dur
ing the next few years went a long
ways toward making my hair as white
as it is now. Finally," here the old
man dropped his eyes and sighed re-
Blind Love.
One of the prettiest of the chorus
girls in a show recently in town re
ceived a note one day that made her
eyes sparkle with excitement. It told
her 'how beautiful she was and that
her every movement was full of ex
quisite grace and charm. The writer
begged her to sup with him some night
after the performance as he was very
anxious to become personally acquaint
ed with her. She showed the note to
her girl friend who congratulated her
on her good luck.
Before she answered the note she and
her girl friend met a well-known legal
light to whom they had been previously
introduced and he was told about the
note. She expressed her intention to
meet the writer as she felt sure she
had made a "mash."
"By the way," she said, "do you know
the gentleman?" mentioning his name.
E The legal light smiled broadly and
when she asked In a sarcastic way
what seemed to amuse him he laughed
outright.
"What are you laughing at?" she In
dignantly asked.
"Why, the man is as blind as a bat,"
replied the legal light as his sides shook
with la*uÂ°:hter.
The pretty chorus girl was mad clear
through and begged her girl friend and
the gentleman to say nothing about the
note, but the story was too good to
keep and now it is a standing joke
among the members of the company.

In the days when life was young-
Let the guelder-rose and the lilac bloom

And the turf be green the paths between.
And, above, the bright flag soar;
And plant the elm for its regal shade.
And the pine for Its boughs of balm.
Magnolia with itÂ» lustrous leaves.
And the jasmtne, by the palm;
For tree, and flower, and pleasant song.
And the tale by the pictures told.
Will help full many a youthful heart
To turn life's gray to gold.
Then make the schoolhouse beautiful
By hill and plain and sea.
For the school is shaping, year by year,
The nation yet to be!

Diana in London.
Time and change are nowhere more
manifest than In the vagaries of Dame
Fashion. For example, let tbe gracious
reader endeavor to obtain a mental
color plate of this lady whom the Lon
don Globe pictured in the riotous splen
dor, of 1S0S. Says the Glooe:
"Yesterday the park and Kensington
Gardens were thronged with elegant
company. The belles displayed antique
and unique fashion. The beaux . ex
hibited the scarlet vest trimmed with
broad â  fur and sold lace. Among' the
oddities, a lady excited general admira
tion; she appeared like a nymph of
Diana's train ready for the chase. Her
mantel of blue velvet was ornamented
by the skin of a leopard; her cap dls-
played the American .rat's skin, her
tippet once covered an Arctic bear, and
her sandals were laced with thongs
made from the hide of the Morocco
goat. She was accompanied by a fe
male whose appearance was equally
striking. A hat curiously vandyked
and lined with crimson, a puce-colored
velvet pelisse, spotted with ermine, and
fawn-colored gaiters, made her appear
a most interesting figure.**
The Highest Raihvay.
One of the most interesting trips af
forded by the present transportation
facilities of Peru is that over the Oroyo
Railroad, which now runs from Call:io
to the gold fields of Cerro de Pasco.
It Is considered" one of tne -wonders in
the Peruvian world, and the original
contract was taken by Mr. Melggs at
$27,600,000 in bonds at 79. It Is cer
tainly the greatest feat of railroad en
gineering in either hemisphere, and as
a specimen of American enterprise and
workmanship it suffers nothing by com
parison. It was begun in 1S70 and fin
ished in 1S76, and additional work has
since been done on it. Commencing in
Callao, it ascends the narrow valley
of the Rimac. rising nearly 500O feet
in the first forty-six miles. Thence it
goes through the intricate gorges .of
the Sierras till it tunnels the Andes at
an altitude of 15.645 feet, the highest
point in the world where a piston rod
â¢is moved by steam. The wonder is dou
bled on remembering that the eleva
tion is reached in seventy-eight mile?.
One, of the most remarkable things in
connection with this road is that be
tween the coast and summit there is
not an inch of down grade. The diffi
culties encountered in its construction
were extreme â landslides, fallfng bowl
ders, soroche (or the difficulty of
breathing ih high altitudes) and ver
rugas, a disease known only along the
line of this road, characterized by a
species of warts breaking! out all over
the body and bleeding. About 8000
workmen were engaged at one time,
and between seven and eight thousand
persons died or were killed in the con
struction of the road.

There is much popular interest, in the
work that will be done by the Austra
lian Parliament, which meets in March.
The capital question and the arbitra
tion acts, important as they are, will
{ give place to the question of Austra
lian defense in view of the war now in
progress between Russia and Japan.
On this subject the Sydney Herald, a
few' days before the war in the Orient
began, said editorially : \
It is not unlikely that the question of Aus
tralian defense will enter upon a new phase,
either before or soon after the Commonwealth
Parliament meets in March." Should war break
out in the Far Host there will naturally be
much disoussicn an to the condition of each
State's forces and equipment, and the problem
of how to organize our defenses in a hurry
will give politicians and people much to think
about. The trouble, of courtÂ«e, always Is that
munitions of, wr.r are like sold in ordinary
business; everybody can do without them until
everybody is arming. Nobody demands gold
i until everybody is rushing to the banks for it,
1 and creating a panic thereby. Yet In defense
munitions of war are but part of the diffi
culty. The finest equipment In the world
would be useless withan enemy hammering at
our gates ur.li'm thÂ«>re had been beforehand the
careful planning of master minds to Insure a
euecefisful mobilization of the forces at our
disposal, and as a corollary the careful train
ing of both the permanent forces and the mi
litia, or citizen soldiery. The one thing that
Mr. Watson and his colleagues have failed to
grasp in this connection is the vital Importance
of a-l.rain to whatever may bÂ« established aa
an Australian army.
XOT IX HOPEFUL. MOOD.
The Federal Postoffice Department is
not in a very hopeful mood regarding
the tenders it has invited for the Eng
lish mail service, as may pe seen from
the fact that is has postponed until
February 15 the time up to which these
tenders may be received. The condi
tions shut out the two best equipped
lines, the P. and O. and the Orient.
The Sydney Morning Herald regrets
the news that the P. and O. Company
will not tender for the new Anglo-
Australian mail service.
For many years, more than fifty indeed.
Eince the Ohusan first ran. that company and
its familiar flag have been a valuable and at
one time an almost indispensable link between
Australia and the old land. It has carried on
Us service, like the Orient Company, efficiently
and well. Regular fast mail service hag "been
maintained between the two hemispheres, a
comfortable and safe means of sea-traveling
has been provided, and the peoples of these
States have learned to trust and esteem the
two companies. The cause of the rupture is
the clause in the postal act forbidding con
tracts with steamship companies employing
colored c-ewÂ«. To the Labor party, which
procured the insertion of the veto, it doe9 not
greatly matter how the mail* are carried, or
what delays occur, or what cost results, so
long as effect is given to a view which In the
present csse is purely sentimental. It cannot
matter to Australian seamen whether ocean
going ship* 1 carry white or black crews, seeing
that both receive less thqn Australian rates of
pay. Any one who has seen the mails shipped
â it is an operation which sometimes takes
hours â musst perceive that to the public- gen
*rai:y tjuick transit is important. Yet. under
the changed arrangrements. Australia will lone
the benefit Cf The fast 'service between Brin
dlsi and Port 'Said â the service of which ap
parfntlj' accounts for P. and O. mails always
being delivered & day earlier than mails by
the Naples route.
Crop returns are keeping up to the
expect at ionÂ«. but how much profit will
accrue to the farmer is another ques
tion.
The caterpillar pest has somewhat
abated, but the butterflies and white
ants show up yet in immense numbers.
STEW ZEALAND REJOICKS.
While Australia is bewailing the fall
ing off in the number of immigrants
to her shores. New 'Zealand is rejoic
ing in a steady and increasing stream
of newcomers attracted 'hither by the
many advantages offered there for set
tlement. The excess of arrivals over
departures last year was 11,275, as
against 7992 the year before. Of this
number nearly 10,000 came from Aus
tralia, and the influx from the com
monwealth still continues, every boat
arriving from Sydney and Melbourne
bringing a large contingent of intend
ing settlers and artisans in quest of
employment.
The over Rea tourist traffic is also
quite large this season.
That the San Francisco mail route is
the best for the whole of New Zealand â¢
is once more exemplified by the ar
rival of the Sierra on January IS vith
the British mails which left London
on December 19, while the mails via
Suez, which left London on December
11 (eight days before the Sierra's mails) ,
have net yet reached Auckland, nor
are they likely to do so for several
days.
The Premier hag received a cable
from the Agent General, stating thut
the Foreign Office has authorized thi
British Charge d'Affalres in Mexico to
sign a postal convention under which
letters from New Zealand shall pay
penny postage instead of 2*4d.
New Zealand made a pc-od .showing
in all agricultural and industrial lines
last year, and her gold production was
over $10,150,000. The increase is more
especially from the quartz mines."

' TALES OF INDIAN LIFE
Hgcrton Young Entertains a Large
Audience at Y. M. C. A. Audi
torium With Discourse.
Egerton Young, noted as a traveler
In the frozen north and a teacher
among the Indian tribes there, de
livered the second of his lectures on
the Indians of Canada at the Young
Men's Christian Association audi
torium last night. Mr. Young proved
to be an entertaining speaker, with a
good delivery and a keen wit. His
lecture was profusely illustrated with
stereopticon views.
As an introduction to his discourse
Mr. Young told a few stories illustrat
ing the peculiar wit of the Northern
Indians and explained a number of
their strange habits and customs. He
dwelt at 'length upon the splendid
mission founded in the northern part
| of Manitoba and told what an import
ant bearing it had upon the civiliza
tion and education of the Indians of
the surrounding tribes.
Mr. Young's short stories and anec
dotes of Indian life were particularly
food and brought forth rounds of ap
plause and laughter from the large au
dience. The stereopticon views were
entirely new and out of the ordinary
and helped the audience follow the
speaker in a great measure.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL," THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 25, 1004.
WILKINSON
IS CALLED
BY DEATH
THOMAS WILKINSON. FOR
MER WARDEN AT FOLSOM,
WHO DIED YESTERDAY.'
Former Warden of State
Prison at Folsom
Passes Away.
OAKLAND, Feb. 24.â Thomas Wil
kinson, former Warden of the State
penitentiary at Folsom, died at 2:30
o'clock this morning at his residence,
1123 Fifth av*enue, after a week of ill
ness from heart disease.
The former Warden was born in
England in 1837. When 14 years old
he came to the United States, settling
at Buffalo, N. Y., where he lived for
many years, becoming a well-to-do
citizen. Among his intimate friends
was Grover Cleveland, former Presi
dent of the United States.
In 1876 Wilkinson, with his family,
came to California and made Oakland
his home for many years, residing at
Highland Park. For several years he
was engaged in the lumber business
and also had mining interests. Later
he entered politics and was appointed
commissary at the State penitentiary
at San Quentin, occupying that re
sponsible position until 1899, when he
was chosen Warden at Folsom to suc
ceed the late Charles Aull.
As Warden Wilkinson was the head
center of attack during the convicts'
break last July. A bunch of the
escaping felons compelled the official
to accompany them for a mile and a
half during their flight. But, the run
aways released the Warden after strip
ping him of his civilian's garments.
Wilkinson was severely criticized
for the break, but his freinds defended
the Warden and declared he was not
responsible. It was admitted after all
was over that Wilkinson was not a
strong executive man, though he pos
sessed a sterling honesty in conducting
the prison affairs that commended him
to the Prison Directors.
, After his resignation in November

MENTION DICK
FOR CHAIRMAN
Friends of Ohio Congressman
Urge Him for Head of Re
publican National Committee
SEVERAL IN THE FIGHT
Senator Penrose of Pennsyl
vania, and Scott of West Arir
ginia Also Being Considered
WASHINGTON, Feb. 24.â There has
been considerable discussion around the
Senate and House about the probable
successor to Senator Hanna as chair
man of the Republican National Com
mittee and the names of Senator Scott
of West Virginia, Senator Penrose of
Pennsylvania and Representative Dick
of Ohio are most frequently mentioned.
A suggestion also is made that Senator
Aldrich no doubt would be connected
with the committee in some capacity?
probably as chairman of the finance
committee. It is said of both Senator
Scott and Representative Dick that
they were closer politically to Senator
Hanna than any other men, and having
been through two national campaigns
with him knew more about his methods
and his connection with national poli
tics than any other man.
Colonel Swords, who for a long time
was sergeant-at-arms of the national
â committee, recently wrote a letter to
Senator Scott concerning Senator Han
na, in which he said:
In the last conversation I had with Senator
Hanna, Just before he went to Ohio prevlou*
to his election, and the last time he was in
New York. I congratulated him upon appoint-
InK you as chairman of the subcommltte on
arranging for the convention In Chicago, .and
he Raid: "Scottle. he knows more about run
ning a national convention than any other man
In the country and he Is closer to me than
an:- other friend I have. He is a great big
hearted fellow, as good aa gold and as true as
eteel, and I cherish him as one of my. best
friends.
It is believed that Elmer Dover, pri
vate secretary of the late Senator Han
na, will be chosen secretary of the com
mittee.
DICK IS NOMINATED
AS HAN'XA'8 SUCCESSOR
Olilonn Is Chosen for Both Unexpired
ami Regular Terms by Re
publican Caucus.
COLUMBUS, Qhio, Feb. 24. â Charles
Dick was nominated by acclamation
for both the unexpired and regular
terms for United States Senator to suc
ceed the late Senator Hanna at the
caucus of the Republican members of
the Legislature to-night. The name
of Mr. Dick was the only^one pre
sented. As the Republicans have a
large majority In both branches Dick's
election Is assured and the balloting
on March 1 will be only a formality.
In the caucus 109 Republican mem
bers answered the roll call, two Sena
tors and six Representatives being
absent.
TWO WOMEN BURNED

In Cleanine, Gloves Victims Come In
Contact With an Oil 'Stove and 'L
Itoth Are Injured.
SANTA ROSA, Feb. 24.â Mrs. T. L.
Neely and her daughter, Mrs. Eva
Kruse, received painful burns Tuesday
evening while cleaning a pair of gloves.
Mrs. Neely was using gasoline and the
daughter put the gloves on her hands
to allow them to dry. Just as she had
pulled the gloves on, an oil stove began
making trouble, and the woman went
to attend it with the gasoline saturated
gloves on her hands. Evidently she
came too near the fire and her hands
were soon ablaze. In attempting to put
out the fire Mrs. Neely also burned her
hands. Her dress caught fire and be
fore it could be extinguished she had
*been paiufully burned about the nos
trils, upper lip and chin. The hands
of Mrs. Kruse were frightfully burned,
as the tight-fltting gloves were thor
oughly soaked with the fluid, and she
has suffered terribly from the Injuries.

IN GOOD FORM
Finishes His Heavy Work and
Now Awaits the Tap of the
Gong on Xext Monday Night
EASILY JUKES TEE WEIGHT
Looks Like a Clever Fighter,
With Punch in Both Hands,
and Is Fast on His Feet
The approaching ring engagement
between Young Corbett and Dave Sul
livan should prove a far. better one than
most followers of the game imagine.
At least It will be if Sullivan's appear
ance and physical condition count for
anything. Dave is ready for battle.
H<Â» is down to wfight and confident of
victory ar.d if he does not win he will
fit least lead the champion a rapid pace
l<Â«r many rounds. Corbett says he
thinks it will take him longer to defeat
Sullivan than it will to stop Britt,
whose colors he expects to lower.
Sullivan is comfortably installed in
liis training quarters at Croll's gardens,
and waiting: the tap of the
punp. His work is practically finished,
for he has already made the required
â wriprht and his breathing apparatus Is
poodâ better in fact he says than at
â ny other time during his career in
the ring.
The -wet weather of the last few days
has not been at all aeroeable to the
little fellow, yet with all that he has
fccen taking his regular spins on the
mad. YpFterday morning he went ten
miles with Frar.k Rafael and after the
run had a rub down and took a few
punches at the bac
In the afternoon he lo!IÂ«Â»d around for
a while and then started in at the bas
Rgain. He gave a fast exhibition of
footwork and hit the leather some ter
rific wallops that mad? the small crowd
<-f admirers rheer and call for some
more action. Then he did a little prac
tice bout with Jimmy Barry and his
day's work was finished.
Sullivan is a likely looking chap, with
well-knit frame and Js possessed of the
Renuine fighting face. He is nicely
muscled and has a long- reach for a
Fmall man. He appears a cool headed
chap â one who refuses to worry or be
worried by any one.
His footwork seems to be one of his
star characteristics. He can spin
around on the tips of his toes and shift
to almost any' position at will. His
best punch appears to be a low one to
ih* 1 stomach that has a deal of steam
behind it, though he uses both hands
in a manner that would lead one to
believe that he has a. good wallop In
ei'.her of them.
Sullivan says he will do no more
boxing in training. He finished up with
t ho "gloves on Tuesday afternoon and
â will devote the remainder of his time
to road work and a little light work
in the gymnasium, such as punching
the bag and shadow boxing. Yesterday
afternoon he tipped the scales at 129
pounds and says he will enter the ring
on Monday night at that weight.
The- big- boxinjf tournament of the
Olympic Athletic Club opens in its
pymnasium to-night. The entry list
is a particularly heavy one and great
pport is promisc-d.
There are three entries in the
heavyweight class. There are two
Jack Sullivans. together with Sam
Berger. One of the Jacks is said to
be a ringer and his record will be
carefully scanned before he is allowed
to pull on a glove. The club officials
have had one experience of this kind
and want to prevent a recurrence.
The San Francisco Athletic Club
and all the boxers who took part in
the <lub's recent exhibition were sus-
TiÂ«?ndec! last night by the registration
committee of the Pacific Athletic As
sociation. The new association, which

Pacliic Coast liCa^iie Officials
In Dillon Matter.
LOS AXGELES, Feb. 24.â James F.
Morley, president of the Los Angeles
Baseball Association and manager of
the club, has resigned from those posi
tions. This action was taken at a
called meeting of. the uirectors of the

those present that Morley and Hanlon
of the Brooklyn club should settle their
claims upon Dillon's services for the
season of 1904 ' between themselves.
Morley received the following telegram
to-day from President Eugene F. Bert
of the Pacific Coast League:
"League voted by wire to relinquish
Castro, Damman and Dillon. Yours
was o'nly negative vote. This league is
now in organized baseball."
A meeting of the local association
was called immediately and. Morley's
resignation was read. No action was
taken on , the resignation and.it went
over until to-morrow. â  Vice President
John Brink to-night sent the following
telegram to President Bert:
"Morley ha? resigned at a meeting of
our directors. We decided that- you
had absolutely no authority to award
Dillon, Castro and Damman.. Please
cite your authority. Morley has letter
from Harris saying Dillon matter
would be settled by Morley and Han

T.ACROSSE ENTHUSIASTS
OPPOSE COAST CIRCUIT
British Columbia Association Officials
Believe the Plan Is Not Feasible
Under Present Conditions.
SEATTLE, Feb. 24. â The Amateur
Athletic Union has been planning to
organize a lacrosse association to ex
tend from California to British Colum
bia. It was expected the plan would
go through, but unexpected, obstacles
have appeared and the matter in its
present form will have to be dropped.
British Columbia is the home of la
crosse on the Pacific Coast and as such
is entitled to consideration. The of
ficials of the British Columbia La
crosse Association say it is "hard
enough to get players away from busi
ness to carry out the schedule of their
own league and to make a circuit of
Puget Sound cities and California as
well would be Cut of the question.
A. ai. Stone, formerly of San Fran
cisco, who is living in Seattle, repre
sents the Amateur Athletic Union in
the Pacific Northwest. At present he
is working on a substitute plan.
Field Day Dates Announced.
The officials of the Pacific Athletic
Association have' selected April 23 as
the day and Berkeley oval the place
for their annual field day. The con
tests on this occasion^ will determine
what athletes will represent this coast
at the St. Louis Exposition.
The Stanford-California field day
will be held on April 16 and the Wash

KENILWORTH CAPTURES THE HANDICAP
BEATING OUT NIGRETTE AND MODICUM
S u e'd o h n son Wi n s
a Purse at
Long Odds.
The two crack mudlarks Lord Mel
bourne and Modicum disgraced them
selves in the mile and a sixteenth
handicap at Oakland ; yesterday in . a
field of but four starters. â
His Lordship's corns must 'ave 'urted
*im bloomin' orful, for he trailed
throughout. The Burns handicap^ win
ner, the favorite for. the race, drew
third position early, in the play and
refused to relinquish same.
Skipp'jr Willie See, on the good ship
Kenilworth, went over the course al
most alone, winning under* closely
reefed sails from Nigrette, the out
sider. The value of the race to the
winner was $800.
The track was sloppy, with good foot
ing underneath. . But two favorites
were successful. Sue Johnson and Ner
vator were both played for good things
at long odds and went through.
SIR PRESTON IN FRONT.
Sir Preston may not have been the
best horse in the introductory sprint,
but he finished first, and that is alt
that is required. A 2 to 1 favorite in
the betting, Travers. who rode Sir Pres
ton, lost no time in getting to the front
and his mount lasted long enough to
beat Handpress a neck, rfol Lichten
stein ran a. close third.
Harry Stover's fast colt, George P.
McXear, scored his second set of
brackets by finishing ahead of Ed
uardo in the two-year-old scramble.
McNear had a pronounced call in the
betting and was piloted by Willie See.
He opened up quite a gap^ of daylight
over his company at the outset, but
cooled off perceptibly as the wire was
approached, only leading out Eduardo
a neck. Harvester, one of the Daly
entries, ran j third. Golden Idol was
out as usual on the turns.
A mighty p'unge was made on Lady
Kent to win <he seven-furlong selling
selectfon. Holbrook and all in the
saddle. Operiing at sixes, the mare's
odds gradually dropped to 3%. She
led from start to finish, winning by a
length from Â«he favorite, Mr. Dingle.
Glissando finished third, Mr. Farnum
fourth and Decoy fifth.
SUE JOHNSON' A MIIjER.
From a panel racer to a miler was
the transformation in the case of Sue
Johnson. Played from 20 down to 12
in the betting on the mile selling run,
the mare skipped away in the lead and
was not headed. Virgie d'Or, a 13
to 1 shot, disposed of Ulloa for the
place. Keyijote, the favorite, got
away badly, . j-an up to second posi-.
tion, then fellj back to the rear.
Jimmy Jon<*s of The Fiddler fame
and Nervator ;must be fast friends, for
the latter hoi'se turned the tables on
Hainault 'in the closing six furlong
3t!iing affair. Hainault went to the
post at 4 to 5 'ind Nervator was backed
from 12 down â ' to 4, later receding to 6.
Jones did not rate the latter as Bell
did some days ago, but went to the
front and won all the way. Hainault
finished second and Ocyrohe third.

Says "Stunt" Is Correct Word.
If there are any wno nave naa
doubts regarding the propriety of say
ing "stunt" they will be relieved now
to know it is all right. Mrs. Martha
Crow Foote says so, and she is dean
of the women's hall at Northwestern
University, in the classic suburb of
Chicago. Mrs. Foote says "stunt" Is
not only a good word, but that it is
correct English â or, rather, American.
In introducing the performers at a
co-ed entertainment recently she used
"stunt," and, moreover, placed her
public seal of approval upon the word.

Condensed Eggs.
In Germany they make condensed

one-pound box containing about fif
teen eggs. This article finds a good
market in South Africa, but during the

USED MOTOR CAR FOR
3IATRIMON1AL. PURPOSES
Terrific Rate or Speed Brought Ob
. dura to Father to Give Ills
Consent. â¢ : â 
A determined suitor has now found
a new wajiof using: the motor car for
matrimonial purposes. The girl was
willing, butter parents were obdurate.
He pretendeil to give up hope and to
be reconciled to the idea of beinj?
merely a friend of the family, and he
took out the girl and her father for
an automobile drive to Havre. At a
dangerous part of the road he sud
denly put on the fourth speed, and the
car sprang away at a terrific rate. Th~
girl sat still and showed no fear, but
her terrified father shouted to the man
who wanted to be his son-in-law to
stop. "Consent to my marriage with
your daughter." was all the motorist
replied. Still the car tore along, ani
if any obstacle had appeared in the
road at least three fatalities would
have occurred. "Stop! We shall all
be killed!" the girl's father continued
to cry- "Most certainly we shall." said
the determined young man, grimly. "If
you don't consent at once I am goln^
to send the machine into the ditch,
and at this rate that means quick
death." As he spoke he imparted vio
lent lurches from, side to side to the
car. "I consent! I consent!" gasp<\l
the new vanquished parent. Immedi
ately the car slowed down, and the rest
of the journey was done at a steady
touring pace. But during the motor'*
previous mad career a policeman had
Jotted down its number. When the
girl's father, to whom the machine be
longs, appeared In court In answer to
the summons, his future son-in-law ac
companied him, and looked exceedingly
pleased with himself. When a fine of
1C francs was imposed the younger man
said he would pay It himself, with
pleasure. He confided to the magis
trate that the day had been named.â

3Iaginniss Asks for Injunction
to Restrain Amalgamated
Company/ Paring Dividends
NEW YORK, Feb. 24.â Justice Gil
derek-eve in the Supreme Court to-day
heard argument upon and reserved de
cision in the application by John Ma
ginniss for a continuance of a tempo
rary injunction restraining the Boston
and Montana Consolidated Copper and
Silver Mining Company, the Par
rot Silver and Copper Company and
the AnaoocdA Copper Mining Company
from paying out dividends to the Amal
gamated Copper Company on the stock
owned in these companies by the last
named " corporation.
Maginnies is the vice president of the
Montana Ore Purchasing Company and
claims that by the arrangements by
which the Amalgamated Copper be
came the parent company of the now
eubsidiary coir r Â»iiies be and other
minority stockholders have been ee
riously injured. The Amalgamated
Copper Company has declared a divi
dend of 2 per cent, payable on Monday
next, but cannot pay unless it receives
the dividends from the subsidiary com
panies, and for this reason counsel. for
the Amalgamated a6ked that the in
junction be immediately dissolved.
Louis Marshall, of Guggenhelmer.
Untermeyer & Marshall, and Mr. Gari
bal, representing the defendant com
panies, asserted that all the allegations
stated in Maginnlss' complaint, with
the exception of some very unimportant
asseverations, .had all been raised In
other suits brought In the Supreme
Court here and In that of Montana,
within the last three years.
Franklin Bien. for Maginniss. claimed
that the arrangement by- which the
subsidiary companies were purchased
was the result of a conspiracy to benefit
the shareholders of the Amalgamated
and Irreparably injure Maginniss and
his associates, who had refused to de
liver up valuable stock In the Parrot
Company and the Boston Company of
Montana for the watered stock 4t the
Amalgamated.
Justice Glldersleev^ took the paper's
and reserved decision.

GROWS BITTER
Courts 'Are Asked to Prevent
Union Sailors From Inducing
Crews to Desert Their Ships
BOSTON, Feb. 24.â The strike of
seamen at this port assumed' a new
phase to-day when a bill in equity was
filed In the Superior Court asking that
the officers and members of the At
lantic Coast Seamen's Union be re
strained from influencing sailors from
shipping on vessels managed by per
sons who are unwilling to accede to
the demands of the union.
The plaintiffs assert that the mem
bers of the union have induced sailors
to desert their vessels, and have, in
certain instances, used force to pre
vent crews being shipped on vessels
managed by the plaintiffs.
John Lind, a walking delegate of
the union and one of the defendants
named in the bill, was arrested to
night on the charge of attempting to
entice a member of the crew of the
schooner Eleanor A. Percy to desert
before the expiration of his coritract.

NEWSPAPER THIEF TOLD
NOT TO DUPLICATE CRIME
Pilferer of Daily Papers Is Given Severe Lecture by
* Judge Cabaniss~"Babe".Curtin Is Safe in Custody of
the Sheriffâ Honorable Jap. Is Honorably Discharged
Niccola Ivanovick was dismissed by
Judge Cabaniss yesterday in the ab
sence of Judge Mogan. He is a boy
aged to the 16-year notch and for
four spare months he has inhabited
this wild United States after. a steer
age voyage from Sicily. From the time
of his arrival he has engaged himself
in the pursuit of stealing -copies of The
Call from doorsteps on Green street v
The testimony she .â >d that the boy
had robbed doorstep after doorstep and
left the occupants of the 'houses wit
less of the main doings of the day the
while they ate their breakfast food in
silence and knew not .whether Japan
or Russia was to-p-up in the little mix
up that is occupying the center of the
world's stage at present.
The Judge gave the youth some much
needed advice, partly on the lines of
petty. larceny, but more largely on the
deprivation that accrues to 'ft citizen
when he finds The Call absent from
his breakfast table.
"Under the constitution of the United
States," said the Judge, "a citizen is
entitled to life, liberty and the pursuit
of happiness. A dish of bacon and
eggs, with a hot cup of coffee, will an
swer the two* first prerogatives, but
where can one chase the elusive phan
tom of Joy unless one reads The Call?"
Pale to the gills, the youth heard the
lecture and promised that never again
would he -steal newspapers from door
steps.-Â»On this positive understanding
he was allowed his freedom.
Curtin, whose main name is
.Anthony, if baptismal cognomens go
/or anything, was before Judge Fritz
yesterday on a charge of carrying con
cealed weapons. He. was held under
bail of $100. That was the least of
"Babe's" troubles. He was ready to
furnish 5100 in good United States coin,
but Judge Cook differed. There was
a burglary charge against the "Babe"
that had been pending since last March.
Therein he is charged with burglariz
ing the premises of a roomer on Mis
sion street and purloining a watch and
several dollars in hard iron money. ' â¢
Curtin was ordered into custody with
out bail by Judge Cook, and the ce
ment floor of the City Prison furnished
him the scant comfort of a bed last
night. The case against him is weak
and he will probably be acquitted, but
whatever discipline he gets in the
meantime Is coming, to him.
Joseph Hodge was a complaining wit
ness in a grand larceny charge against
William O'Brien and John Moran in
Judge Fritz's court yesterday. The
witness claimed that the two young
men had robbed him of a gold watch
and $3 50 in coin.'.
Both defendants testified that Hodge
was an old acquaintance of seventeen
years' standfnE^and that the alleged
robbery was merely a 'figment of the
brain. They admitted taking Hodge
to his room in the Lindell Hotel, but
positively denied the larceny of. his
money and watch..
Hodge blew into the courtroom dur
ing the hearing withm load of peaches
that would . swamp a Fresno County
orchard. Judge*. Fritz eyed him glassily
for a minute and then ordered him into
custody. Bailiff Jack Conlan- put him
in the dock and Hodge went off into
slumberland with a rapidity that star
tled a cocaine fiend. "Chee," said the
fiend, "if booze will give the big get
away, why didn't I troi dat foist?"
Father Grey, the aged priest, who
claims that Thomas F. Brennan had
robbed him of $37,000, was unable to
appear yesterday in Judge Conlan's
court. Illness and age have gripped
the old pastor forcibly and he Is in
no condition to leave his bed.
On the witness stand yesterday there
were three officials of the Crocker-
Woolworth Bank and one from the
Hibernia Bank, who told in detail the
monetary transactions that Brennan
conducted with Father Grey's account.
Further hearing in the case was con
tinued until next Friday.
Edward E. Stoddard, who once was
the manager of the bicycle department
of Dunham, Carrigan & Hayden
Company, was held yesterday to an
swer to the Superior Court by Jydge
Fritz in bonds of $5000 on a charge
of felony embezzlement. The com
plaint alleges the theft of $150, but
the firm says that Stoddard is shy more
than $4000 in his accounts. '
"I desire to return to that honorable
Nippon arid take up honorable arms,"
explained Jen Kaza to Judge Conlan
yesterday. For five nights he had
been a bedfellow to Chinatown gin
bums, Barbary Coast consumers of
paint and the flotsam and jetsam that
rest every eve in the City Prison un
der the generic classification of "lodg
ers." .
He had bÂ£en plying the trade of
"good, honest,' industrious schoolboy"
for several years in this port. He
lived up to those conventional jyljec
tives until the Japs saw Admiral Alex-"
ieff first. Then the fire of patriotic
ardor that burned, in the breast of J.
Kaza exploded, i
He remembered the example of N.
Bonaparte, who got the double cross
in the frozen highways of Russian He
wanted to prove that this Frenchman
was a "mutt." He desired to return to
that dear Nippon ond roust up an
army and strike a blow for his home
arid his geisha girls.
He had $2 98 when the war began.
Yesterday he was a dollar nearer re
turn fare. He economized by joining
the army of city "lodgers." The po
lice became. tired Tuesday evening and
classified him as : a "vagrant."
"'Do you deny that you are a vag
rant?" asked Judge Conlan.
"Honorable magistrate," replied the
little fellow, who had sampled the tea
of Nagasaki, Yokohama and Kobe in
his infancy, "I Am a patriot."
"Dear ' me," said the Judge, "I
heard that word" when I went to
Echooll , 'Patriot'â that brings back
past memories."
"It , is honorably so, honorable
Judge. < I have been honorably, econ
omizing." said the JaD. "I honorably
desire to depart to Nippon, therefore
1 have been a lodger in your honor
able; jail." - .' \
: "Back; to' the geisha girl3 then."
Â«aid Judge Conlan. "But I have a few
cents on^.he Slavs. It's a distant race
and the track is muddy."
The JajT was honorably dismissed.
Before Judge Fritz, appeared ope
Hugh P. Silvert, whose trouble waÂ»
that! he was hitched to a check for
$10 85 signed by John Roberts, a har
ness-maker. Â£
With Mr. Silvert it's a case of "who
frew, dem chicken feathers 'round
my door?"- -
If he could find the man who put
that bit. of paper, into his pocket some
thing- wofiid'be doing.
"I don't know why, you should cher
ish samples of Mr. Roberts' chirbg
raphy, but I will find out to-morrow,"
said Judge Fritz. Then the harness
maker will be in the judicial traces.

Ernest Alexander, Charged With "
Accepting a Bribe.
The case of Ernest Alexander, an
ex-policeman, charged with accepting
a bribe from Mamie Lin, alias Lulu
Wilson, while a member of the depart
ment, was called for' trial yesterday in
Judge Lawlor's court, but at the re
quest of Assistant District Attorney

March 4, as no trace* had' yet been
found of Rose Everett, the missing
witness!". Attorney O'Connor, for the
defendant, objected to the continuance
and said he would enter a plea N oÂ£
once In Jeopardy.
The Judge was informed that Mamie
Lin had gone to Los Angeles, but was
willing' to return and testify at the
trial if her expenses were guaranteed.
The Judge said she was under the or
der of the court and unless she was
present when the case was called for.
trial she would be guilty of contempt
of court and would be brought back
and punished.,
PATROLMAX INJURED WHILE
STOPPING A RUNAWAY TEAM
Brave Officer Knocked Down 'and
, Kicked hy Horse, but Holds on
â¢ In Spite of Hurts.
Patrolman McEntee was the hero
of an exciting runaway accident last
night at the corner of Powell, and
Market streets. He succeeded in
stopping a pair of fast horses just as
they were about to dash into Market
street, but before he accomplished, the
feat he was knocked down by one of
the fiery steeds and is now suffering
from a probable fracture of the jaw.
The teRm belongs to the Great
American Tea Company, and while
the driver was delivering some goods
took fright and started to run down
Powell street in the direction of Mar
ket. McEntee, with great presence of
mind, caught hold of one of the
horses and held on, though he was
knocked down and kicked by the
frightened animal. A large crowd
gathered around the scene of the run
away and excitement ran-high for a
few minutes.

Mining Company, and Charles H.
Brown, . J..E. Ebert and T. T. Williams,
associated together under the name of
the Bright Star Mining Company, and

FREEDOM GIVEN
TO MRS. WILSON
After 3Iany Delays, Wife of
Santa Barbara Farmer Gets
Divorce on Desertion Charge
LITIGATION LONG DRAWN
Case Was Set for Trial in
Two Counties, and Is Finally
Settled in Graham's Court
A final adjudication of the matrimo
nial troubles of Charles C. Wilson, a
prominent rancher of Santa Barbara,
and Clara Wilson was reached yesterday
In Judge Graham's court, when an In
terlocutory decree of divorce was
granted Mrs. Wilson on the ground of
desertion. The dispute over the prop
erty <of the couple was settled out of
court.
The troubles of the Wilsons were
brought into the divorce court more
than a year ago when Mrs. Wilson filed
a suit on the ground of desertion. Then
her husband appeared and on the
ground that he was a resident of Santa
Barbara secured a change of venue to
the southern county. The case was set
'for trial down there, but was never
heard, as Mrs. Wilson, by means of af
davits showing that this city was the
proper place for the action to be heard,
had it sent back here.
At the hearing granted the suit yes
terday by Judge Graham it was shown
that the Wilsons were married twenty
three years ago and that they have two
children over the age of majority. The
marriage took place at Santa Barbara
and the couple took up their residence
here within a few months after the
ceremony was performed. For a time
their married life was happy and then
they quarreled and .Wilson went to
Santa Barbara. He wrote to his wife
from there, asking her to come back to
him, but she refused, informing him
that she preferred San Francisco and
the society of her two children. A few
months later Wilson was hurt In an
accident and his wife hearing of it
wrote and asked him to come to this
city, where she could care for him. He
refused and some months later came
here on a visit. He was met here by
mutual friends of himself and wife, who
asked him why he did not go back to
his wife. He told them he never would,
and when this information was carried
to Mrs. Wilson she filed an action for
divorce.
Judge Graham also granted Mary Ar
nold a divorce from Francis Arnold on
the ground of neglect.
Marietta Viola is suing Salvador! Vi
ola, who owns a large farm in Sonoma
County, for divorce on the ground of
cruelty. She charges? that for the last
year he has not treated her as a good
husband should, and that once during
that time he locked her up and re
strained her of her liberty for four
days.
Though only married to Thomas
Brown since last November, Catherine
A. Brown is already satisfied that she
cannot be happy with him. In her suit
for divorce she asks for a decree on the
ground of cruelty, charging that Brown,
notwithstanding his promise to lavish
upon her three young daughters by a
former marriage his love and affection,
persists in abusing them and threaten
ing to turn them into the street.
Suits for divorce were also filed by
James McGinn against Mary E. Mc-
Ginn for desertion. Mary Fortunado
apainst John Fortunado for cruelty.
May O'Brien against Edward O'Brien
for negloct. Bella May Lucero against
Peter Henry Lucero for cruelty and
Ellen Roe against Eugene Roe for de
sertion and neglect.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL. THURSDAY, FEBRUARY. â â  25, 1904.
TRANSPORT DIX A PRISONER BEHIND
THE SHOALS OF COLUMBIA RIVER BAR
Big Army Freighter Is Detained at Astoria Unable for Lack of
Deep Water to Reach the Open Sea â Mules Are Awaiting
Her Here and She May Have to Discharge Cargo to Get Free
FRENCH BARK BRIZEUX. WHICH YESTERDAY ENDED AT ANTWERP A STORMY VOYAGE FROM THIS
PORT. SHE I.OST SPARS AND SAILS AND NARROWLY ESCAPED SWAMPING FROM A SEA WHICH
TUMBLED OVER HER AFTER END AND DISABLED HER RUDDER.
Whatever consideration the army au
thorities might have had for the claims
of Portland as a shipping point has
gone a-glimmering within the past few
days and the Columbia River people
will long lament the scurvy trick their
river bar played them in holding pris
oner the transport Dix at a time when
Uncle Sam wanted her in a hurry- The
Diz went to Portland to load hay and
fodder for the Philippines. She was to
return here for several hundred mules
before starting across the Pacific.
She reached Portland all right and
left there for this port a week ago with
a V>Ig cargo of hay and grain. She
reached Astoria and there she is still
stuck, unable to reach the open sea
because of the lack of water on the
Columbia River bar.
The Government dredger Chinook has
been trying to shovel a passage through
which the Dix might safely pass, but
rough weather has interfered with the
dredging operations and the only hope
for the Dix is a spell of fine weather
and a good high tide.
Meanwhile the contractors engaged to
fit the Dix with stalls for the mules
find that their preparations to do a
rush job in record time were wasted
and the mules are eating their heads
off at the Presidio. The delay is caus
ing the Quartermaster's Department
no little inconvenience and it is pos
sible that the Dix may have to dis
charge all or part of her cargo at As
toria, come down light and either ship
other hay and fodder or wait until
that now -in her hold can be brought
here either by rail or on smaller ves
sels whose size will better suit them
for the shoal waters of the Columbia
bar.
China Will Be Crowded.
The steamship China, which sails to-morrow
for the Orient, will carry all the passengers
eh", can accommodate, and 3oOO tons of general
carco. Among the passengers will be Rich
ard Harding Davis and other writers bound
for the seat of war to gather material
for special correspondence for American
and foreign Journals and magazines.
The China's cargo includes 3fMi tons
of lead and about 700 tons of beef. The
beef Is r>art of the order bought in this coun
try by the Russian Government and is marked
for shipment to Vladivostok by way of Naga
saki. The shipping directions will probably
be changed and the transfer from the China
made at Hongkong instead of at the Japanese
rort. The China will be the first Oriental
lirer to leave here in many months whoae
cargo has included no flour.
Wharf Proves Too Small.
The rain yesterday seriously interfered
with discharglng/the Algoa's cargo and work
â was sloped altogether at 2 o'clock in the aft
ernoon. By this morning, however. Captain
T. D. K. Wilson will be prepared to tlefy the
elements and under the cover of canvas nine
pangs of stevedores will rush the work of un
loading the biggest cargo ever taken alongside*
the Pacific Mall wharf. The wharf space at
the disposal of the steamship compnay has
been insufficient for a long time and it will
bo absolutely impossible to care for all the
Alcoa's freight at the Mail dock. Through
the courtesy of the Collector of the Port the
warehouse adjoining the dock has been placed
at the company's disposal and into this big
storehouse much of the overland freight from
the Alzoa is beins trucked. In a few days
the Algoa will be moved to Greenwich-street
wharf and there will finish discharging.
Stormy Passnjre Home.
The French bark Brizcux, which lefj" here
September . 20. arrived yesterday at Antwerp
more or less the worse for wear. The passage
from the new world to the old was a stormy
one and more than once the elements threat
ened to overwhelm the French bark. In a
storm encoJntered November 18 the Brizcux
lost many sails and had yards and running
rigging damaged. A mountain of salt green
sea, toppled on board over the after end on De
cember 6 and Injured the rudder as well as
sweeping the deck clear of all movable impedi
menta.

PROMISES LOVE;
GETS PROPERTY
Kit-hard K. Lowe. "Wealthy Min
ing" Man of Alaska, Sues His
AVife for Return of Riches
SAYS SUE DECEIVED HIM
Alleges That He Gave Her All
He Owned, Believing That
.Her Love Was All for Him
Richard R. Lowe, a wealthy mining
man of Alaska, and Virgie Graves
Lowe, his wife, have quarreled, and as
a result two suits have been filed in
the Superior Court here by Lowe to re
cover property alleged by Lowe to have
teen given by him to Mrs. Lowe. One
of the actions is to recover two Swiss
watches, a nug-get chain and a dia
mond stud worth $1300. and for $1000
damages for their detention by Mrs.
Lowe. The other suit Is for an injunc
tion restraining Mrs. Lowe from dispos
ing of $150,000 wouth of property he
says he gave her to hold in trust for
him in December, 1899. when they were
married. Pending the trial of both
actions, the property will be placed in
the hands of David Rich, who upon
the filing of the complaints yesterday
was appointed receiver by Judge Ker
rigan. The court also issued an order
temporarily restraining Mrs. Lowe
from disposing of any of the property
claimed by Lowe, and ordered her and
the Alaska Commercial Company and
the Alaska Packers' Association, which
corporations have the custody of the
disputed property, to appear before him
to-morrow and show cause why the
temporary injunction should not be
made permanent.
According to Lowe's complaint for
an injunction, he was married to the
plaintiff in 1899 at Oakland, shortly
after his return from a successful trip
to Alaska. He claims that she gave
him to understand that she was deeply
in love with him, and he, believing her,
conveyed to her all his property. The
conveyance, he says, was made with
the understanding that she was to hold
it in trust for their common benefit and
in order that in their declining years
they might have a sufficient income to
make their last days comfortable. All
was well for a few years, says Lowe,
and then came petty bickerings and
quarrels and finally, within the last
year, a separation. Mrs. Lowe, he says,
left him without any cause or reason
and absolutely refused to return to him
his hard earned wealth. Because of
her refusal, he alleges, he Is forced
to the conclusion that she never loved
him; that she married him simply to
get control of his property, and by de
ceiving him got him to convey it all
t%Â» her.
In the suit to recover the jewelry
"Roxle Graves" is a defendant with
Mrs. Lowe. She and Mrs. Lowe are at
the Lick Hpuse, and Lowe is a guest
at the Occidental.
The defendant was formerly an ac
tress and known as Virgil Graves. She
first met Lowe in Dawson while play
ing in the ''Gay Parisian." Their mar
riage quickly followed, but from all
accounts was never a happy union, a
fact which is attributed by many who
knew the couple in the north to the
discrepancies in their ages. Lowe being
more than twenty years his wife's
senior. They came out of Dawson last
year and were for a time liv
ing together at the Occidental Hotel.
Mrs. Lowe, however, soon left her hus
band and has since, been living alone
at the Lick. Lowe, when seen last
evening, said that he and his wife had
had a disagreement over property mat
ters, but that everything may soon be
settled and he added:
"There will be no divorce. In fact I
have been over talking with my wife
to-day and we got along very nicely."
Evidently the breach between them
is not as great as the cdmplaint filed
yesterday would indicate, for shortly
after the interview last evening a mes
senger was carrying notes between
them. Lowe is widely known in Daw
son, where he has made a large fortune
in mining and other, enterprises. *
Declare Votes Were Illejrallv Cast.
E. L. Cutten and other stockholders
in the Union Square Market Company
yesterday filed a suit to set aside, an
election of directors of the corporation
held last month. It is claimed by the
plaintiffs that a number of votes cast
at the election were illegal. At the
election in question the following
board of directors was elected: B.
Miller, A. L. Vermeil, E. L. Cutten.
H. A. Rosenbaum. J. Hertz, S.
Stephens and J. L.e Maitre.

The trial of Edmond de Labrousse
for the murder of Miss Marie Jordan
was resumed yesterday in Superior
Judge Dunne's court, when Assistant
District Attorney Whiting began the
argument for the people. The Aaaist
ant District Attorney commented npon
the serious duty the Jury had been
called upon to perform, and said. In

law which applies to *uch a case does not

The law of Insanity has be*n Â«o abuaed, thÂ»

Assistant District Attorney "Whiting
then reviewed the evidence of the wit
nesses in support of his argument.
PLEA OF INSANITY.
Attorney Thodore Roche followed for
the defense, and claimed that the pros
ecution had not shown that his client
was sane. Mr. Roche said the murJer
was committed without malice afore
thought, without a de3lre for venge
: ance and without premeditation, and
| held that the highest crime for which
he could be convicted, if convicted at
all, was manslaughter. The evidence
j of insanity, Mr. Roche said, had been
' offered honestly, and he contended that
i the defense had proved that the pris
i oner was insane by a preponderance
| of evidence. Holding that such was
the cafe at the time of the commission
i of the murder, counsel asked the jury
i for an acquittal.
Argument will , be resumed this
morning by Attorney Alford, also for
the defense, and later District Attor
ney Byington will reply.

Ned' York Stock Market
NEW YORK. Feb 24â ThÂ« action of the
stock market became halting and irregular to
day on a somewhat decreased volume of busi
ness The moderate g^ins established during
the early pert of the day were subsequently
lost. Ttie motive of the early advance was
not very clear, but it was attributed to a cov
ering movement amone the shorts. The bor
rowing demand fcr stocks on the exchange this
! morning pointed 'o the existence of a consider
able short interest. This prompted some of the
traders to take the long side In the hope of dis
lodging the short inter* Et. The signs of an
oiÂ«>n short jvisltlon were not wanting yester
day. Uit in the then suspicious mood of traders
It was bofieved to be more apparent than real.
* ThÂ» professionals were then convinced that the
j real liquidation coins on was concealed by
I the borrowing of stocks for temporary delivery
j In order to hide the character of the welling.
There was a feeling thlÂ» morning, on the con
trary, that the selling movement had some
what overrun its life. The recovery of Amer
icans in London helped this feeling. The buy
ing movement wan lacking In vijeor. and the
resulting advance was very moderate. The
weak tone of the latter market was clearly
< nough due to renewed apprehensions over the
financial *itnation at the great money centers
of the Ccntinept. The reports of numerous
bank failure* at Berlin. Paris. Vienna and
Lyons, and rumors that there would be fur
ther failure at other continental points weak
ened all the markets.. There was nothlnt: In
the war news to account for this reaction, but
It cave rise to natural misgivings that the
diplomatic situation mieht be etralned so as
to threaten eventualities. The relative firm
ness of Amaleamated Copper was attributed
to expectation of the dismissal of a temporary
injunction asairnt uayment of dividends on
stock of subsidiary companies owned. Net
losses were eeneral at the close, but. on only
a few leadine stocks did they approach a
point.
There were erme spots in the early bond
market, but prices generally gave way in sym
pathy with stocks. Total salts (par value),
$1,405,000.
United States bonds were unchanged on the
last call.

Hay and Feedstuff s.
_Â»^/4%:'.-,r' - â  ; ; ... ;' !
There was no Hay market â  yesterday awing
to the -heavy rain. Feedstuffs were, as pre
viously quoted. The circular of Somers & Co-,
says of Hay: "Shipments of Hay for the past
'.week, show en Increase, of 600- tons over the
'week preceding. .2000. tons in, comparison with
2000.' It was found that the arrivals of last
week were not â  suf Helen t fpr â¢ the demand, eo
all holders of Hay have Increased their orders.
â Of course it must be remembered that about
100 tors daily are taken from the market to be
pressed. up for Manila shipment, and this will
continue until the â¢ first .of March. After, that
date we .will probably ' see continuous light
shipments until the end of the season.
"We have '.very .little of interest to report
concerning the local situation here except that
although trading is a bit light, yet the market
holds with quite a firm tone. .
"In all probability there will be but little
Hay sent to .the southern part of the State
now from districts that supply this >â  market.
Tliey have had bountiful showers in both San
Diego and Los Angeles counties, which - has
tended to release many lots of Hay that were
being held for home consumption. .. This fact
affects so wide a territory that. thÂ«y will have
little need to come as far north as San Fran
cisco unless the spring turns dry again,,. To the
north of us there will; be probably, no trading
unless their markets * should - become depleted
hMca.ua* of as Qciag tal demand. , There is still
considerable Hay being shipped throughout the
country immediately tributary to San Fran
cisco, and with the trade now in sight we will
have juÂ«t about enough to last us through In
good shape. To summarize, we can state that
prices will hold about as they are unless we
have some outside trading, of which as yet
we have no definite knowledge.
"We give no. change In quotations from the
prices given last week excent that Straw is a
bit ' dull at the present moment owing to a
rather free supply." 1

disposing of stocks at an advance. 'Sweets 'were
closely cleaned up and firmer. No fresh stock I
came in'. Holders of Onions- were still exacting
high prices and the market ruled steady.
Asparagus sold at a wide range as to quality.
Sixteen : boxes came In and there were about
eight boxes carried ' o\-er from the preceding
day. Receipts of southern vegetables con
tinued light and prices had but slight variation.
Mushrooms continued to decline under steadily
Increasing receipts. Rhubarb was offering
again, but sold slowly. A few boxes were re
ceived from the recently . organized Rhubarb
Growers 1 Association. The consignee was in
formed that a minimum price of 12 %c per
pound was established by the association for
No. 1 stack and he waa directed to return the
shipment at the expense of the shipper if it
could not ba sold at that figure.

\, Poultry and Game.
The Poultry market was in good shape for
sellers. The high prices of Chickens, checked
the demand somewhat, but as supplies were
-none too plentUul prices were well sustained.
A car of Western was marketed early in the
day and cleaned up quickly at good figures. A
1 second car came in later and was pretty well
I cleaned up at the close. Dressed Turkeys wero
1 numlnal, only one small case b3ing received.
Game was dull and unchanged, with the stock
sttil showing the effects of the moist, clone
weather.

Butter, Cheese and Eggs.
Butter was generally quoted lower yester
day. Supplies were heavy and in execs* of .the '
demand, and dealers offered concessions to buy- ;
era, to little purpose, however. The warm |
rams are increasing the weakness of the j
market. . \ ,
Cheese continues weak and depressed, with â¢
! stocks still too heavy. 1
! Eggs continue to decline and tlÂ»e downward
I tendency is becoming more pronounced. The
i market I? full of sellers and buyers are few and
purchasing only from hand to mouth. The
offering by retailers to sell the Ijpst ranch at
1 2.V 1 Is helping the market down about as much
an anything else. They do it every year about
this time. ; - â  '

Deciduous and Citrus Fruits.
The fruit market was dull and featureless, ]
as the rainy weather checked local trading and
there was nothing doing in the shipping line.
Small and medium sizes of Navel Oranges con
tinued abundant, but 96s and 112s were in
comparatively light supply, and such offerings
were firmly held at full figures. There was an
unusually large attendance at th? Orange auc
tion, but no ono seemed to want to buy any
thing and .the bidding was very slow. Five

greatly to the annoyance of Mayor Ol

Senator Perkins.
The high standing of Mayor Olney in
the legal profession and as a citizen
led Senator Perkins to send the query.
The Mayor refuses to say what reply
he has made. In fact he declines to
eay anything about the matter at this
time.
"To tell you the truth." said the

FOOTPAD HOOPER RETRACTS
HIS FLIMSY "CONFESSION"
Says He Wove the Fabric of Falsehood in Order to "Jolly"
the Law Officers Who Questioned Him in Marin County
Jail â He and Carson Held for Arraignment Next Friday
Like a house of cards the "confes
sion" of Austin Hooper, highwayman,
has collapsed. Its author yesterday
pronounced it a fabric of falsehood,
woven in an imagination heated by
yearning to acquire the fame that is
coveted by criminals and shunned by
honest men. He said he constructed
the flimsy narrative simply to "Jolly"
the law officers who had him under the
"sweating" process in the Marin Coun
ty Jail, but the general character of
ihe youth indicates that his principal
prompting motive was to depict him
self as a very desperate fellow.
Hooper's retraction was not needed
to prove him a prevaricator. The Call
of yesterday showed that he had not
participated in the Colonial Club rob
bery in^this city on February 12, but
was at his mother's home in Petaluma
on that date and for several weeks
prior thereto. Indeed the entire "con
fession" was discredited by The Call,
and apparently deceived only certain
critics of the San Francisco Police De
partment, who are ever ready to grasp
opportunity to fling censure. Captain
of Detectives Martin and his men be
lieved Hooper was lying, because they
knew that the criminals he had named
as his accomplices have not been in
San Francisco for a long time and
could not possibly have done any of
the things he accused them of doing.
But their explanation of that fact did
not save the detectives from arraign
ment for alleged neglect of duty. They
were charged with having willfully re
fused to arrest "English Dick," "San
Jose Blackie" and Ray Fahey after
Sheriff Taylor of Marin County had
told them where the trio could be
found. Sheriff Taylor now says that
Captain of Detectives Martin gave him
every possible aid in finding the crim
inals, but they were not where Hooper
had told him they might be found, a
lodging-house at Second and Minna
streets. Martin's men knew they were
not there, but to satisfy the Sheriff
they raided the place and other places
suggested.
WHAT MARTIN" KN'EW.
Hooper says that "English Dick" was
rot with him in any of his enterprises.
Martin knows that since "English
Dick" was released from the peniten
tiary he has been at work in Sacra
mento, that "San Jose Blackie" has not
been in San Francisco for many months
and that Ray Fahey is as far away
from California as he could remove
himself since he escaped from Folsojn
last July. There are rewards upon th-;
head of Fahey that exempt him from
being ignored by any police officer who
may run across him.
Martin is still emphatic in declaring
that the alleged confession of Hooper in
San Rafael is not to be considered in
connection with the robbery of the
Colonial Club, and he says that bo far
a? thp local detective departmept is
concerned, no effort will be made to ar
rert the men whose names have been
mentioned as participants. Martin said
further:
I We have positive information that the men
kn^wn as â¢"San Jose Blackie" and "English
Dick" have not been in or near this city for
a r.umbfr of years. The last named man. If
hÂ» if the party, whom we have reason to be
lteve he is. has been in Sacramento and has
bÂ»en earning Â«n honest livelihood. Fahey. of
court-*, we would take into custody as quickly
a,s Â»Â«> could apprehend him. He was one of
the convicts who escaped from Folsom Prison,
FAIR DEFENDANT SAYS
DRESS WAS MADE CROOKED
Miss R. Cahen Sued in Justice Dumi'4
Court by Tailor That Built the
Garment.
A large contingent of ladies was
present yesterday in Justice of the
Peace Dunn's courtroom during the
progress of the suit brought by
Charles Stockwitz, assignee of A.
Mayer, a ladies' tailor, who sued Miss
R. Cahen of 643 Baker street for
$50 50, th*- value of a dress made f^r
the fair defendant. ,
Miss Cahen testified that she en
tered into negotiations with Mayer
for the making of the dress, but when
it was sent home she tried it on and
found it was not made in the man
ner agreed upon.
"Everything on the dress from top
to bottom was crooked," asserted
Miss Cahen. "The braid on the sleeves
was crooked and I could not get my
arms in the sleeves because the
sleeves were crooked, too. I refused
to pay for the suit and the result is
that I have another one on my hands;
I mean the court suit."
Miss Cahen's remarks produced
po much laughter that Judge Dunn
was compelled to rap sternly for or
der.
Mrs. Boxald corroborated Miss Ca
hen's testimony and opined that shÂ«
was competent to judge because she
is an experienced dressmaker. After
Mayer, the builder of the condemned
dress, had testified that the dress was
a perfect fit the case was submitted
by the attorneys, who promised to file
briefs on authorities in support of
their clients' respective contentions.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 25, 1901
and a reward for hit capture U still hanging
over him.
But there is at least one grain of
truth in Hooper's "confession." That
portion of it relative to the attempt by
Carson and himself to rob the shoe fac
tory at Petaluma was confirmed yester
day, when Superintendent Cline in
formed The Call that a number of his
employes saw the buggy standing at a
near-by corner last Saturday and a
strange young man (probably Carson)
prowling about the factory. Before he
was -ent to the penitentiary Hooper
worked in the factory, and at that
time the employes were paid every Sat
urday. Since then the payday has been
changed to Wednesday.
HELD FOR ARRAIGNMENT.
SAN RAFAEL. Feb. 24.â Austin Hoo
per and "Shorty" Carson have been
held in $5000 ball each to answer the
charge of "holding up" Shannon's sa
loon at West End last Sunday night.
The preliminary hearing of th,e two
young crooks took place to-day before
Recorder Murray. Neither of them of
fered any defense, and they were not
represented by counsel. Only two wit
nesses were calledâ William Shannon,
the saloon-keeper, and James Crow,
who was in the saloon when it was
raided. These men positively identified
Hooper and Carson as the robbers.
Late this afternoon Judge Lennon
had the men brought into the Superior
Court. He appointed E. B. Martinelli
to defend Hooper, while James K. Haw
kins was chosen to look but for Car
son's interests. Hooper, at his own re
quest, was arraigned, but asked that he
be allowed several days in which to
plead, and Judge Lennon fixed Friday
morning at 10:30 as the time for en
tering a plea. In Carson's case the de
fendant asked that his arraignment be
postponed until Friday morning, which
was granted.
A complaint has been sworn to in Sau
salito before Justice Pryor charging
Hooper and Carson with grand larceny
at the saloon of Antone Lawrence, but
District Attorney Boyd will try the
Shannon case first. It is believed that
before the trial comes up Carson will
plead guilty, but Hooper vehemently
asserts he will "give the authorities a
run for their money."
MATERNAL LOYALTY.
Mrs. C. T. Hooper, mother of Austin,
came down from Petaluma this morn
ing and had a long interview with her
son. She is a wealthy woman and it la
believed she will furnish money to de
fend him. She did not hesitate to say
he was thoroughly bad, and asserted
she had given him every chance to be
decent, but he had caused her much
trouble for many years. She said:
Yes, Austin is bad, though he has had everj
reason to be otherwise. We were always indul
gent with him and offered him all the advan
tages of education. It was our plan to eend
him to Tale, but very early in life he gave us
trouble. He was In the lone Reform School
and later in San Quentln. 'When he left there
on January IS las>t he came home and prom
ised us he -would be a good boy. They say he
w(is In the Colonial Club robbery, but he was
at my home the night that occurred. He left
Petaluma last Monday. I did not want him to
go. for I knew he would meet some of his old
companions and pet into trouble again. I be
lieve the boy'n intentions are all right, but in
bad company he' is weak. While I have given
up hope of reforming him I can't desert him in
this hour of serious trouble.
Hooper's first crime was the stealing
of a bo'at in Petaluma. With several
companions he organized a band of
creek pirates and invaded a number of
clubhouses, shooting preserves and cab
ins along the river. For this he was
sent to the reform school, but made his
escape and was never taken back.
CONVICTED BURGLARS
APPEAR FOR SENTENCE
Edward Yarrow and Clifford Mcldrum
Sent to Prison for Three and
a Half Years Each.
Edward Yarrow and Clifford Mel
drum, who were convicted by a jury
in Judge Lawlor's court on charges'
of burglary in the second degree, ap
peared for sentence yesterday. Prior
convictions of petty larceny against
Yarrow and burglary in the second de
gree against Meldrum were withdrawn
and the Judge sentenced each to serve
three and a half years, Yarrow in San
Quentin and Meldrum in Folsom.
They broke into the' room of George
Olson at Montgomery avenue on
the morning of April 6 and stole two
watches. They were arrested before
they left the building by Policemen
Matheson and Merchant. - '
Yarrow has been a lucky criminal.
Twice previously he was tried on
charges of burglary and acquitted and
once he was arrested on a similar
charge, but the owner of the house
entered declined to swear to a com
plaint against him.

Movement to the . East of
State*Exhibits Tliat Are As
sembled About to Commence
A dispatch was received from T. C
Judkins yesterday at the headquar
ters of the committee having in charge
the making of a San Francisco exhibit
at the St. Louis Exposition in which
the information was contained that the
St. Louis management has approved
of the San Francisco building as pro
posed with the exception of certain
flagstaffs. In the same dispatch came
a report concerning the bids that have
been made for the construction of the
San Francisco building. The lowest
bid was for $11,800. '
Architect Newsom will remain in St.
Louis until work is begun. The struct
ure will stand close to the end of the
model street and there will be but one
building between, it and the main en
trance, the one intervening being the
model day nursery that will be erected
to represent New York City.
The acceptance of the San Francisco
plans means that the feature of roof
garden and cafe is insured. The bids
include the cost of the garden and cafe.
While the contract price Is $11,800 for
the construction it is expected that
with the articles that have been of
fered for the adornment of the interior
the total value will not be less than
$20,000. Tanners have promised to give
leather; others have agreed to supply
burlap; the redwood men will give
woods for the interior, the cost of
which material alone would be $2000.
Five San Francisco banks have
j agreed to guarantee the cost of putting
) up the San Francisco building pending
} the receipt of the money promised by
' the Board of Supervisors, amounting to
! $15,000. A guarantee of the contract
; was accordingly sent on last night by
; the Bank of California to the Boatmen's
! Bank in St. Louis. The San Francisco
banks that have made the advance
pending the paying over of $15,000 by.
i the city are the Bank of California,
! First National, San Francisco, San
! Francisco Savings and Loan Society
j and the Crocker- Woolworth National
i Bank. The finance committee Is now
making endeavors to get in more
I money as soon as possible. The cost
I of arranging for a proper display must
I be met soon to insure the proper in
j stallation and setting for exhibits.
State Commissioner Wiggins will go
to St. Louis this week to take charge
of arriving California exhibits and to
transact such other business as is nec
essary to attend to at the St. Louis
end of the line. Heretofore California
exhibits have nofgonp on with the.ex
ception of a carload of Watsonville ap
ples for cold storage. To-day the first
of materials for the mining arch to
be raised above the California display
In the mines and mining buildl/ig will
start overland. The first of the for
estry exhibit of this' State, to be In
stalled In the forestry building, will
also be shipped. All the California ex
hibits for St. Louis with the exception
of fresh fruits to be grown that will
have to be sent on during the summer
have been assembled at San Francis%o
and at other convenient points.

THE REQUISITE AT SMART FUNCTIONS
BIG INCREASE
IN VALUATION
Property of Spring Valley Com
pany Is Estimated at Up
ward of Fifty-Two Millions
BRAUXHAET'S IRE ROUSED
Mayor's Veto of Bills Presented
Is Referred Back to Board
Without Recommendation
The Board of Supervisors met yester
day afternoon to consider, as a com
mittee of the whole, the fixing of water
rates. An elaborate verified statement
was handed in by the Spring Valley
Water Works, which placed the .total
valuation of the plant at $52,964,700.
This aroused the ire of Supervisor
Braunhart, who characterized such a
statement as ridiculous. Excitedly
waving the typewritten sheets contain
ing the statement in the air, he ex
claimed: "This is what I call trifling
with a most serious matter. This com
mittee is here to consider the fixing of
water rates on a fair valuation, and a
preposterous figure like this is handed
us. This valuation is simply impossi
ble, as only last year Mr. Schussler es
timated the value of the plant a,t about
$40,000,000, and there is nothing to show
that it has increased in value to such
an enormous extent in the meanwhile."
In reply. Attorney Kellogg, repre
senting the corporation, replied that he
did not think Mr. Braunhart's remarks
were, fair, as he had condemned the en
tire report after a mere examination of
the sum total. He said that all the
property owned by the company was
listed in the report submitted and the
valuation was reasonable. In response
to an interrogation from Supervisor
Braunhart, he asked tartly, "Do you
expect us to agree with the valuation
made by your engineer?" City Engi :
neer Grunsky had placed a valuation
of $24,673,000 on the plant.
WAGES ARE HIGHER.
Mr. Kellogg explained further that
the valuation of the plant has been in
creased during the year owing to the
increase in the cost of labor, both for
operating and for construction work,
which latter, he said, is being carried
on all the time, and the cost of this has
increased 50 per cent during the year.
In view of this fact he said It was but
natural that a building erected by
workmen at a salary of $2 a day would
be rated higher than a similar one
where the laborers were paid but. $1 a
day. The cost of Jmllding material and
pipes a'so has advanced greatly, and,
on the whole, he did not think a mod
est jump of $12,000,000 at all exorbitant,
inclining rather to the belief that the
water company is dealing very gener
ously with the people.
The first witness called yesterday
afternoon was C. W. Williams, an en
gineer employed by the water company.
He was questioned as to the relative
expense of pumping 1,000,000 or 2,000,000
gallons of water. In reply he stated
that the expense for labor was the
same, but more fuel might be required.
When interrogated specifically regard
ing the vast difference in the figures of
the last year and preceding years at the
Belmont station he accounted for the
Increase by stating that $1SOO had been
expended in repairing "an engine and
this amount was charged to operating
expenses. He could not tell why the
cost of pumping was greater in 1902
than in 1903 or than the amount esti
mated for 1904-5.
LITIGATION INCLUDED.
Chairman D'Ancona then stated that
the object of the inquiry was to de
termine what portions of the statement
should be charged to operating ex
penses, what to construction and finally
the actual value of the plant. Branden
stein called attention to the fact that
the expenses of litigation in the Clough
contest were included In operating ex
penses and contended that the rate
payers should not be taxed to carry on
a suit to quiet. title. Mr. Kellogg re
plied that the Clough suit was to de
termine the right of the company to
lands purchased In 1875 and of which
the company has had undisputed pos
session until recently. He considered
it but just that this be brought under
the head of operating expenses.
"Well, it Is Simply a suit to quiet
title, nevertheless," retorted Branden
stein, "and has no more, right under the
head of operating expenses than the
acquisition of new property would have.
It is unjust to expect the ratepayers ot
San Francisco to be taxed for any such
litigation."
Inquiry was made regarding the
amount of taxes paid by the Spring
Valley Company in San Mateo County,
but its representatives were hopelessly
Ignorant on that subject. Mr. Kellogg
made a rough guess, but In answer to
a direct question was unable to say

MAYORS VETO.
Prior to the water rate Investigation
the vetoes of the bills of the company
were considered. These were for wa- â¢
ater supplied for hydrants and public .
buildings during the last month and [
the veto was on the technical ground j
that a proper list of the places sup-'
plied with water did not accompany
the demand. The sentiment was
strongly in favor of overriding the veto. I
as It was stated that every demand j
presented since the new charter went I
into effect might be vetoed on the same j
ground. There was no allegation of
overcharge, the bills being well within
the limit. It was finally decided to
refer the matter, back to the regular
meeting of the board without recom- J
mehdatlon. '
STORM PREVENTS ANNUAL
INSPECTION OF CAVALRY

from Vancouver Barracks with a num
ber of prisoners, and Assistant Surgeon

Refuses to Swear Out Warrant.
Ernest Hollensteiner, who keeps a
grocery on Geary street, who applied
for a warrant last Saturday for the
arrest of Fred S. Adams, son of a
well-known family in Oakland, for
passing a worthless check for $100
on him, called at the Bond and War
rant Clerk's office yesterday, accom
panied by Jules Gamage. collection
agent. A letter had been written to
Adams to call at the Warrant Office
and make an explanation. Dut he paid
no attention to it. Hollensteiner re
fused to swear to the warrant for
Adams' arrest/ as he said Gamage had
assured him that the check would be
paid by Adams, the same as in many
other instances.' ,â '
Chinese Arrivals Decreasing.
United States Immigrant Commis
sioner Hart H. North has compiled
some significant statistics concerning
Chinese immigration at this port. Dur
ing the fifteen months from July 1,
1875, to October 1, 1876, before the
exclusion act ,went into effect, there
arrived 22.879 male Chinese and 276
females. In sharp contrast are the
arrivals for the fiscal year ended June
30, 1903, which amounted to only
1628, of which 517 were admitted as
American born citizens.
