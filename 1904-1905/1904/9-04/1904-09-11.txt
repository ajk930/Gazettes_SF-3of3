over which hung a slight mist of vapor,

city, and become degenerates. We have
known men who have come here for
no other purpose than to prove their
unassailable virtue, who have strode
into the arena of temptation, waving
the â the what Is Itâ the white flower of

"You all seem to be trying to pull
my leg," Sir John - remarked quietly.
"I suppose you'll come to the point
soonâ if there Is one."
Drummond shook his head in melan
choly fashion. .
"He dissembles," he. said. "After.all,
how easy the descent is, even; for the
greatest of us. I hope that James will
not be lone with that ; whisky and
Apolllnarls. My nerves are shaken. . I
require stimulant." ' . Â¦

"I should imagine," he said, shaking
out a copy of ;the Times, "that it is
your brain which Is addled." ,
Drummond looked up with mock
eagerness. " ..-..-, â¢
- If only there." had .not' been' this
single torturing thoughtâ a mere pin
prick, but still curiously persistent.
Suddenly he stopped short He was
in front -of -one of, the more Imposing
of the cafes - chantants â opposite, il
luminated; with a whole Trow of: lights,
was the wonderful .- poster, which had
helped^ to! make s Alcide famous. He
had" looked at -It before without com
prehension. To-night the subtle sug
gestiveness of ; those few < daring lines,
fascinating in" their;. very/ simplicity,
the head thrown back, the half-closed
in the somewhat mixed society among
which he moved neither satisfied his
taste nor appealed in any way to his
affections. The girl whom he had met
by chance' and befriended had done
both. She possessed what he affected
"to despise, but secretly â¢worshiped, the
Innate charm of breeding. The Pel-
Ilssiers had been an old family in
Hampshire, while his grandfather had
driven a van. The fact Itself was
nothing to him, but it placed the girl
vei r y far apart from the. young ladies
of Hampstead and Balham, whose
fathers and brothers had been his as
sociates. He believed in her firmly.
This club gossip and chaff to which he
had been subjected was annoying
enough, but ridiculous. He chose a
fresh cigar/ and strolling along under
the tret?s, here and there touched with
the/ lurid - brilliancy! Â¦: of 'the 7 electric
.lights,' gave himself .^up f to3 the*; rare
luxury; of i imaginative thought. Â¦
;AÂ» in all. things, s<J his thoughts came
to him "deliberately. â¢ He "pictured him
self visiting her in this shabby little
home of her aunt â she had told him
that it was shabbyâ and he recalled
that delicious little smile with which
she would surely greet him, a smile
which seemed 'to be a matter of the
eyes as well as the lips. She was poor.
He was heartfully thankful for it. He
thought of his wealth for once from a
different point of view. How much he
would be able to do for her. Flowers,
theater boxes, carriages, the "open se
same" to the whole world of pleasure:
He- himself, middle-aged, steeped*in tra
ditions of the city and money-making,
very ill-skilled In all the lighter graces
of life, as he himself well knew, could

most magical powers of an unlimited

out of her narrow, little* life, and ' it
should, be all owing to, him. And after

the deep cool green of the lime-trees.

"I am sorry," she said. "If you find

you any more questions to- ask me?"
Sir John, on his way down, had de
termined to hint to this young woman
that, providing certain contingencies
which he had- in his mind should come
to pass, he would be prepared to make
her a handsome enter tc change her

the tlmr had come he utterly lacked
the courage to attempt â¢ any such
spe-Â»ch. Â«. . -, .
"None, I thank you," he> answered.
Courtlaw crossed the room and
threw open the door. He had come
to Anna's rooms from a dinner party
and he was in evening dress. Sir
J&hn, who was standing outside,
looked past him at the girl still sit
ting In the shadow.
"I believe," he said stiffly, "that
these are the apartments of Miss
Pelllssler. I must apologize for dis
turbing you at such an unseemly hour,
but I should be very much obliged if
Miss Pellissier would allow me a few
minutes' conversation. My name is
Ferringhallâ Sir John Ferringhall."

"Alcide."
"Your sister," he answered, M did me
the honor of dining with me last
night."
"Yes."
After all, it was not so easy. . The
girl's eyes never left his face. She was
civil, but she was obviously Impatient
to know his errand. Afraid, no doubt,
he thought grimly, that her other vis
itor would leave.
"I believe." he said slowly. *tliat I
shall do best to throw myself upon
your consideration and tell you thÂ«
truth. I have recently made your sis
ter's acquaintace, and In the course of
conversation I understood from her
that her Christian name was Anna.
Some friends who saw us dining to
gether persist in alluding to- her as
Miss Annabel Pellissier. I am juilty
practically of the impertinence of com
ing to ask you whether I misunder
stood your sister."
"Is my sister's Christian name, then,
of so much importance to you?" she
asked with a faint smile.
"The things Involved In It are," hs
answered gravely.
She accepted his rejoinder with a
brief nod. Courtlaw opened his lips,
but remained silent In the face of her
Imperative gesture.
"Let me hasten," she said, "to reas
sure you. My sister was scarcely
likely to make a mistake. She told
you â the truth." .. â¢
Courtlaw's walking stick, which ha
had been handling, fell with a crash to
the ground. He stooped to recover it,
and hl3 face was hidden. Sir John
felt and looked several years younger.
"I am much obliged to you," he said.
"Really, I do not know why -I should
have doubted it."
"Nor I," she remarked terselyi
He looked at her with a certain curi
osity. She was a very elegant young
woman, slightly taller perhaps than
her sister, and with an air of reserved
strength underneath her quiet face and
manner which Annabel may have
lacked. It was hard to associate her
with the stories which he and all Paris
had heard of "Alcide."
"You. then," he said, "are 'Alclde.'
That wonderrui posterâ la of you."
She lifted her 'eyebrows. .
"It. is," he replied, "the one humil
iation' : < of ': my. life.. .My opportunities
have been ' immense . and my failure
utter. ' If I had been your companion
only, \ and not l your, master, I might
very well have been content to accept
you for what you seem. But there
have been times, Anna, when your
work has startled me. Ill drawn,
without method or sense of propor
tion, you have put wonderful things
on to canvas, have drawn them out of
yourself, notwithstanding your me*
chanical inefficiency. God knows how
you did it. You are utterly baffling."
She laughed at him easily and
mirthfully.
"Dear friend," she said, "do not
magnify me into a physiological prob
lem. I should only disappoint you
terribly some. day. I think I know
where I am puzzling you now "
v "Then for heaven's sake be merci
ful," he exclaimed. "Lift up one cor
ner of the curtain for me."
"Very well. You shall tell me if I
am, wrong. You see me here, an ad
mitted failure in the object to which
I have devoted two years of my life.
You know that I am practically des
titute, without means or any certain
knowledge of where my next meal is
coming from. I speak, frankly be

like to. .= Very well! I will try to help
you." .
Her hand hung over the side of her
chair nearest to him. He looked at it
eagerly, but made no movement to
take It. During all their long com
radeship he had never so much as
"I believe that you are right," he
paid softly. "It is the worst of in
cluding in our vocabulary words
which have no definite meaning, per
haps I should say of.whlch the mean

view. You", for instance, you live, you

Bohemianism seem like a vulgar
thing." v '
She stirred gently In her. chair.
"My friend," she said, /"I have been
your pupil for two years." You have
watched all the uncouth creations of
my brain come sprawling out upon
the canvas and besides we have been
companions. Yet the fact remains
that you do not understand me at all.
No, not one little bit. It is extraor
dinary."
She raised her eyebrows.
"Troubles, my friend," she ex
claimed lightly. "But I .have no
troubles."
He stared at her incredulously, and
she laughed very 7 softly. :
"What a gloomy person you are!"
she murmured. "You call yourself an
artist â but you have no temperament.
The material cares of life hang about
your neck like a millstone. ; A doubt
as to your, dinner to-morrow v.'ould
make you miserable to-night. You
know I call all that positively wicked.
It is not at all what I expected, eltner.
On the whole. I think that I have been
disappointed with the life here. Tnere

"And yet," he murmured, "one of
the greatest of our writers has de
clared that the true spirit of Bo
hemianism is denied In your sex."
"He was. probably, right," she de
clared. "Bohemianism is the least
understood word ever coined. I do
not think that I have the Bohemian
spirit at all."
He looked at her thoughtfully. She

most to her throatâ her small, oval
face, with the large, thrown . eyes, was

know quite well that your troubles
are far "more likely to weigh upon me
than my own." Do .you. think that I
am utterly selfish?" -
She smiled.
"How am I to earn enough sous for
my dinner to-morrowâ or falling that,

His face darkened.

"You have the temperament," he
said. "You have the ideas. Your first

avail is th'c? You have no execution,
no finish. You lade only that mechani
cal knack ot expression which is the

ous and a!;.-'>;u?e necessity. We have
both tried Vi.-::d rÂ» develop itâ you and I
âand we haw- failed. It is batter to

"Much better." she agreed. "Oh,
much better."
"Personally." he went on, "I must
confess to a grt.u disappointment. I
looked upcr. you from th2 vary first
as the most promising Of my pupils. I
overlooked the mechanical imperfec
tions of your v.ork, the utter lack of
finish, the erutlene.Â«s of your drawing.
I said to myself, 'this will come.' It
seems that i was mistaken. You can

She was silent, and in the gloom of
the dimly lit apartment he could not
ge<> h^r facv. He drew a little breath of
relief. The worst was over now. He
continued tenderly, almost affection
ately.
"After all. there are great things left
in the world for you. Painting is only
one s'ender bianch of the great tree.
To-night ail this may seem hard and
cruel. To-morrow you will feel like a
freed woman. To-morrow I shall come
and talk to you again â of other things."
A man of Infinite tact and kindness,
he spoke his message and went. The
girl, with a little moan, crossed the
room and threw open the window.
She looked steadfastly out. Paris,
always beautiful even In the darkness,
glittered away to the horizon. The
lights of the Champs Elysees and the
Place de la Concorde, eug-gestive. bril
liant, seductive, shone like an army of
fireflies against the deep cool back
ground of the night. She stood there
with white set face and nervously
clenched fingers. The echo of those
kindly words seemed still to ring in her
ears. Ehe was crushed with a sense of
her own terrible impotency. A failure!
She must write herself down a
failure! At hsr age, with her
ambitions, with her artistic tempera
ment and creative instincts, she was
yet to be denied all coherent means of
expression. She was to fall back among
the ruck, a young woman of taient,
content perhaps to earn a scanty living
by painting Christmas cards, or teach
ing at a kindergarten. Her finger-nails
dug into- her flesh. It was the bitterest
moment of her life. She flung herself
back into the bare little room, cold,
empty, comfortless. In a momentary
fury she seized and tore in pieces the
6tudy which remained upon the easel.
The pieces fell to the ground in a little
white shower. It was the end, shs told
herself, fiercely. And then, as she stood
there, with the fragments of the torn
canvas at her feet, some even caught
upon her skirt, the door was thrown
open, and a little girl entered, hum
ming a little tune.
The newcomer stopped short upon
the threshold. ,
"Anna! What tragedy has happened,
little sister? No little lights, no supper.
no coffee â and. above all, no Mr. Court
law. How dreary it all looks. Never
mind. Come and help me pack. I'm
off to England." -.
"Annabel, are you mad? To En;,
land! You are joking, of course. But
come in, dear. I will light the stove,
and there shall be some coffee pres
ently."
"Coffee! Bah!"
The newec-mer picked her way across
the floor with daintily uplifted skirts,
and subsided ir.to a deck chair of
stretched car.vas.
"I will not rob you of your coffee,
most dutiful of sisters!" she exclaimed.
"I have had adventures â oh, more than
one, I can nsson you. It has been a
marvelous day â acd I am going to
England."
Anna looked at her sister gravely.
Even in her painting smock and with
her disarranged hair, the likeness be
tween the twrt girls was marvelous.
"The adventures I do not doubt, An
nabel," she said. "They seem to come
to you as naturally as disappointment
â to other poop!e. But to England!
What has happened, then?"
Already the terror of a few hours
ago seemed to have passed awav from
the girl who leaned back so lazily in
her chair, watching the Up of " her
patent shoe swing backward and for
ward. She could even think pf what
had happened. Very soon she would
be able to forget It.
"Happened! Oh, many things." she
declared Indolently. "The most impor
tant is that I have a new admirer."
The wonderful likeness betweeen the
two rirlF was never less noticeable
than at that moment. Anna sXood look
ing down ur>on her sister with grave
perturbed face. Annabel lounged In her
chair with a sort of Insolent abandon
in her pose, and wide-open eyes which
never flinched or drooped. One realized
Indeed then where the differences lay:
the tender curves about Anna's mouth
transformed into hard, sharp lines in
Annabel's; the eyes of one truthful
and frank, the other's more beautiful
but with less expressionâ windows lit
Â¦with dazzlinsr light but through which
one saw â nothing.
"A new admirer. Annabel? But what

"Everything! He Is Sir John Fer

So Annabel departed with the slleht
est of farewells, wearing a thick trav
eling veil, and sitting far back in the
corner of a closed carriage." Anna
"My dear Anna! As though I should
think of depressing you with my long
list of misdeeds."
"You have nothing to tell me?"
"Nothing!"
"Annabel," she said, "I have never
asked you for your confidence. We
have lived under the same roof, but our
ways seem to . have lain wide apart.
There are many things which I do not
understand. Have you anything to tell
me before you go?"
Annabel laughed lightly. Already
she was almost herself again. '
"How ..unkind!" she exclaimed.
"Still, since it is better to tell you, Sir
John Is very much in earnest.' but his*
respectability Â¦ is something - altogether
too overpowering. Of course I knew,
all about him years ago and he is ex
actly like everybody's description of
him. I am afraid, Anna,\just a little
afraid that in_ParIs land my friends
here might seem â¢Â» â¢ trifle advanced. Be
sides, he might hear things. That is
why I called myself Anna."
"You â you did what?" Anna ex
claimed. , :
"Called myself Anna," the girl re
peated coolly. "It can't make any
difference to : you and . there a are - not
half a dozen people ' in Paris Â¦ who
could tell us apart."
Anna tried to look angry, but her
mouth betrayed her. Instead she
laughed, laughed with lips and .eyes, .
laughed till the tears ' ran down her,
cheeks. . 'â¢
"You little wretch!", she exclaimed
weakly. Â¦ "Why should I, bear the bur-;
den of your wickedness? Who knows
what might come of it? I shall per-/
mit nothing of the sort."
Annabel shrugged her shoulders.
"Too late, ray dear girl," she ex
claimed. "I gave your name. I called
myself Anna. After all, what can it
matter? It was just to make sure.
Three little letters can't make a 'bit of
difference."
"But it may matter very much in
deed," Anna declared. "Perhaps for
myself I do not mind, but this man is
sure to find out some day, and he will
not like having been deceived. " Tell
him the truth, Annabel."
"The truth!"
There was a brief but Intense si
lence. Anna felt that her words had
become charged with a fuller and
more subtle meaning than any which
she had intended to impart. "The
truth!" It was a moment of awk
wardness between the two sisters â a
moment, too, charged with its own
psychological interest, for there were
secrets between them which for many
months had made their intercourse a
constrained and difficult thing. It was
Annabel who spoke.
"How . crude you are, Anna!" she
exclaimed with a little sigh. "Sir
John is not at all that sort. He is the
kind of man who would much prefer
a little dust in his. eyes. But heavens,
I must ;iack!"
t>he sprang to her feet and disap
peared in the room beyond", from
which she emerged a few minutes lat
er with flushed cheeks and disheveled
hair.
"It is positively no use, Anna," she
declared, appealingly. "You must
pack for me. I am sorry, but you
have spoilt me., I can't do it even de-'
cently myself, and I dare not run the
risk of ruining all my clothes. Lis
ten! What's that?"
There was a sharp tap at the door.
The words seemed to die away on
Annabel's lips. The old look of terror
for a moment, convulsed her face.
Anna, seeing it, caught her by the arm.
"Annabel, what is the matter?"
They were face to face in the mid
dle of the room, Anna on her way to
open the door. But her sister Inter
posed.
"Don't answer it, Anna! Come!"
The gesture was one of entreaty.
Anna found herself . perforce obeying
it. The two girls stole away into the
inner room. Annabel softly locked
the door/ but remained kneeling
down by the keyhole. They were
scarcely concealed before the" outer
door opened and the shrill voice of
Marie, the eldest daughter -of their
concierge, commenced a torrent of ex
postulations. - Â¦
"But you see! It is as I tojd you,
monsieur. The room is empty. The
young mademoiselle has been here
and gone. She packed her boxes in
one half-hour and departed for Eng
land. It was a loss, but" what mat
ters ? Such rooms let easily â mon
sieur can see for himself the beautiful
light, the view, too."
A man's voice interposed â coarse
and stridentâ the voice of an English
man speaking _the most abominable
â¢ French.
"I wonder whether you are filing
the truth, crirl!"
Marie | was justly indignant. Her
shrill voice grew shriller.
"But what does monsieur suppose?
Is it for such insults that I have
climbed, all these stairs and admitted
monsieur here? Well, it is over. 1 Mon
sieur will be so good as to descend at
ouc-i-." I
The unseen man pointed apparently
to the door, behind which the girl was
cowering. -
"There's another room there! How
do I know that she isn't hiding? .If
what I guess is true, she'll be none
too anxious to be dropped upon Just
yet." â¢ ? :
"And what business of monsieur's
is it if there is another room there?"
Marie demanded. 'He asks for Made
moiselle Pellissier. and I tell him that
she is gone, gone, gone! Is it so dif
ficult to understand? Those rooms
beyond were not even let to her. They
are let .to another, tenant. If mon
sieur pleases."
Monsieur 'was apparently bundled
out. The outer door was closed. Steps
were heard descending the stone
stairs. Anna looked with grave eyes
at the girl who was still on her knees
by the keyhole, and whose face was
blanched with terror.
"Is it you, Annabel?" she asked. In
a low tone, "who have bought these
lies from Marie?"
Annabel rose slowly to her feet. Her
knees were still tremblinr. The hunt
ed look remained in her eyes. She
had had a shock.
"There was no buying," she an
swered. . "Marie was always our
friend. I told her if any one came for
me â that I had left. I do not wish to
be worried Just now."
"Who is that man ?"
"I do not know!"
"Nonsense. Who is he?"
"Indeed I do not know," Annabel
persisted. "He is the friend of some
one I loatheâ some one of whom I
om afraid. There .are' several of them. '
They pester me to death." . - â¢
"iou are going to England to'es
cape from him?" .;. â¢ ' *.ââ¢;Â¦ '
"Partly â yes."
"Why? What is he to you? What
harm can, he do you?"
Annabel, mercurial, Inconsistent, a
strange mixture of coward and fatal
ist, began to recover herself. She rose
to her feet. The footsteps of Marie
and her companion had died away. â¢
"None," she declared, "none what
ever. I am so easily upset, but I hate
to be bothered. Please go on with my
packing. I have so little time. Don't
crush my crepe de Chine, whatever you
do. I shall have to take your trunk.
Sorry, but you j won't be going away
Just yet. shall you?"
"You have told me all that you in
tend to?" Anna asked. .
"Don't be melodramatic. There is
nothing to tell."
Anna continued her task in silence.
* With deft fingers she created order out
of chaos. Soon the trunk, portmanteau
and hat box were ready. Then she
took her sister's hand. It was as cold
Â¦ as ice. ...-y-r :Â¦ ,. ;<
She stopped short. There was a
sharp knocking at the outside door.
Courtlaw rose to his feet.
"It is too late for visitors." she re
marked. "I wonder would you mind
seeing 'who it is."
"Dear friend," she said, "do you not
think that you are breaking* an un
spoken compact? I am very sorry. In
your heart you knew quite well that all
that you have said is useless."
"Ay," he repeated, looking away from
"Useless â worse than useless."
"You are foolish," she declared, with
a note of irritability in her tone. "You
would appear to be trying to
destroy a comradeship which has
been very, very pleasant. For you
know that I have made up
my mind to dig a little way into life
sir.gle-handed. I, too, want to under

ventured to hold her. fingers. This was

never been very different from the

for you?" .
She shrugged her shoulders.
"Is that not rather a profitless spec
ulation, my friend?" /.
He seemed deaf to her interruption.
His gray eyes burned under his shaggy
eyebrows. He leaned toward her as

She laughed gayly. v
'.'Dear friend." she said, "remember

failed in the only serious object whicn
she has ever sought to accomplish. My

"Young? I am twenty-four."
"Yet you are very young. Anna, why

"Don't!" she cried.
"But I must. I will," he answered
fiercely. "Oh, I know you would stop

I will give you a broad, free life. You

The woman shrugged her shoulders.
"It Is a great art." she said in
broken English. .".The little English

But, Sir John's eyes were still riv
eted upon the poster, and his heart
was beating with unaccustomed force.
For Just as Â¦ though a vague likeness
is sometimes borne swiftly In upon
one, so a vague dissimilarity between
the face on the poster and the heroine
of his thoughts had slowly crept into
his consciousness. He drew a little
breath and stepped back. After all.

eyes â the toner meaninar of the great
artist seemed to come , to him with a
rush.. He' stood still;' almost. breathless.
A slow anger burned "in the man. It
was debauching, thisâ a devilish art
which drew such strange allurements
from a face and . figure almost Ma
donna-like to their , simplicity. - Un
willingly he drew a little nearer, and
became one of the group of loiterers
about the entrance. A woman
touched, him lightly on the arm and
smiled into his face.
"Monsieur admires the poster?" '_
THE SAN FRANCISCO SUNDAY CALH
to our sense of humor Is tfce fact that

"Will you tell me," Sir John said'
ponderously, "by what right you call
that young ladyâ la petite Pellisster? I
should be glad to know how you -dare
to allude to her in a public place in
such a disrespectful manner! 1 ,'
Drummond looked at him and smiled.
"Don't be an ass, Ferringhall," he said
tersely. "Annabel Pellissier is known
to most of us. I myself have had the
j pleasure ; of :; dining ? with Â« her. r. She - is

. Sir John held up his hand.
"Stop!" he said. "You do not even
know what you are talking about. The
young lady with whom I was dining
last night was Miss Anna Pellissier.
Miss Annabel is her sister. I know
nothing of that young lady."
There was a moment's silence. Drum
mond took up a cigarette and lit it.
"The young lady, I presume, told you
that . her name was Anna," he re
marked.
. "It was not necessary," Sir -John
answered stiffly.- "I was already aware
of the fact. I may add that the family
is well known to me. : The two aunts
of % these young ladles < lived : in
Hampshire. Under the circumstances
you must permit me to be the best
judge of the identity of the,young lady

Like most men who 'lie but seldom,
he lied well. . Drummond smoked his
cigarette meditatively.- He remember
ed that he had heard stories about the
wonderful likeness between those two
sisters, one of whom was an artist and;
a recluse, while the other had attach
ed herself to a .very gay and a, very
brilliant little; coterie of pleasure-seek
ers. There was a bare chance that he
had been mistaken. He thought it best
to let the matter drop. A few, minutes
later Sir John left the room.-,

"Anna!"
Anna kissed, her sister and nodded to
her aunt. Then she sat down â unin
vitedâand looked from one to the other
curiously.' -There was something about
their greeting and : tone of Annabel's
exclamation which puzzled her.
"I wish," she said, "that you would
leave off looking at me as though I
were something grisly. I am your very
dutiful niece, aunt, and. your most de
voted sister, Annabel. I haVen't mur
. dered * any lone, or. broken the law In
any way that I know of. Perhaps you
will explain the state of panic Into
which I seem to. have thrown you."
"I trill not intrude upon you further."
"Walt," she said. **;
He turned back at once.
"I have answered all your questions,"
she said. "Perhaps you will not ob
ject to answering one for me. You
have thought it worth while to take
some considerable pains to resolve for
yourself my sister's identity. May I
ask the nature of your interest In
her?"
He hesitated.
"It is not an easy matter." he said,
"for me to offer you an altogether ade
quate explanation. I have c-nly seen
your sister for a very brief time, : -id I
am a little past the age when a man
does headstrong things. At the same
time, I must say that I am most anx
ious to improve my acquaintance with
her. I am a single man, and "
"Thank you," she interrupted. "I
will not ask you to explain further.
Good-nisht."
He left at once, immensely relieved,
yet scarcely satisfied with himself as
regarded his share of the Interview
with this young woman. They heard
his â¢ footsteps descending the stone
staircase, growing fainter and fainter.
Then Courtlaw looked acioss at her
vjth :: white puzzled face.
"Why did you lie to that man?" he
asked fiercely. "How dared you do
yoursflf this injustice?"'
"I did it for her sake," she anspered.
"It may be her salvation. I believe
that he wi'.l marry her."
"You would let him â knowing â all
that you know?"
"Why not? Fhe is my flesh and
blood. She is? more dear to me than
anything else. Perhaps if I had
watched. over her more closely, things
would hsvo been different."
"You! Why. you have been an angel
to her," he exclaimed impatiently.
"Vou knov.- v<vry well that she is self
ish and plefsure-Ioyins to the back
bone. You have made enough sacri
fices for her sureiy without this. Be
sides, you car.nut tell where it will end.
Tou have taken upon your shoulders
the L>uruen cf her misdeeds. You may
have to carry them further andlonger
than you think. Oh, it is unbearable."
The man's face was dark with pas
sion. It was as though he were per
sonally aggrieved. His tone was rough,
almost threatening. The girl only
smiled at him serenely, but she laid her
hand for a moment quietly upon his.
"Dear frierxl," che said, "this is a
matter fe-hkh you must leave to me to
do as I think best. Annabel is my sis
ter, you know, almcst my only relative.
If 1 do r.ot look after her, she has no
wie. And sh3 is very young, younger
than her years."
It was significant of her influence
over him that lie answered her calmly,
although a storm of ar.gry thoughts
were struggling for expression within
"Look after her! Why not? But you
have done it all your life. You have
been her guardian angel. But even
you cannot alter her character. Anna
bel was born soulless, a huiflan butter
fiy. if ever there was one. The pursuit
of p'easure. reif-sratifieation. is an
original !r.sai::ct with her. Blood and
bone, body and spirit, she is selfish
through and through. Even you have
rot bsen able to hold her back. I speak
no harm of her. She is your sister, and
God knows I wish her none. But "
A look checked him.
~I knov.," she said quietly, "that
Paris, where the has been so^ much
admired, is cot a good place for ?jer.
That is why I am glad that she has
gone to London."
He rc-sc from his chair, and walked
restk-.ssly up and down the room,
passioii cf pent-up speech compelled
action of some sort. There was a black
fear in his heart. He stopped before
her suddenly.
"Vou, too." he said abruptly. "You
mean to fellow her. You will go to
London?"
"It Is necessary." she answered.
"You yourself have decided that â apart
from the question of Annabel."
He vas suddenly ca.hr.
â¢Tt iÂ» part of the irony of life," he
said. "One is always playing the sur
jreon, one kills always the thing one
loves best. I meant to lie to you.
"Would to God I had."
She shook her head.
"The surgeon's knife is surely a kind
ly weapon." she declared. "It was best
for me to know. Later on I could
ecarcely have forgiven you."
"And now â I am to lose you."
"For a little time," she answered.
"J meant to say good-by to you to
right. Or. after all, is It worth while?
Th<s Channel is a little broader than
the Boulevardsâ but one crosses it
BometimeE."
He looked at her with white, set face.
"Yes," he said, "I shall come. That
is very certain. But, after all, it will
be different. I think that I have be
come a drug drinker. I need you
every day. In the mornings I find la
bor easy because I am going to sea
you. In the afternoon my brain and
flngeis leap to their work because you
have been with me. Anna, you shall
not go. I cannot let you go."
She threw away the end of her ciga
rette. Without turning or looking In
his direction she leaned forward, her
hÂ«?ad supported upon her fingers, her
elbows upon her knees. She gazed
steadily out of the window at that arc
of glittering lights. He made, a quick
movement toward her, but she did not
flinch. His arm fell to his side. The
effort of self -repress! on cost him a sob.
"David." 6he said, "you are not a
coward, are you?"
"I do not know," he muttered. "The
bravest of us have joints in our ar
mor."
"You ere not a coward," she repeat
ed, "or you would not be my friend.
A woman may choose any one for her
lover, but for her friend she makes no
mistake. You are not a coward. Da
vid. an<2 you must not talk like one.
Put out your hand and bid me God
ep*ed. It is the only way."
"I cannot do It!" he cried hoarsely.
"I cannot part with you. You have
grown into my life. Anna "
Again Fhe stopped him, but this time
It was not so easy. The man's passion
became almost unbearable at the
thought of losing her. And yet, as she
rose slowly to her feet and stood look-
Ing at him ulth outstretched hands, a
strange mixture of expressions shining
in her wonderful eyes, he. realized In
some measure the strength of her de
termination, felt the utter Impotence of
anything which be could say to her.
He forgot for the moment his own self
pity, the egotism of his own passionate
love. He took her hands firmly in his
and raised them to his lips.
"You shall go," he declared. "I will
make of the days and weeks one long
morning, but remember the afternoon
must come. Always remember that."
Her hands fell to her side. She re
mained for a few moments standing as
though listening to his retreating foot-
steps. Then she turned, and entering
the inner room, commence.' to dress
hastily for the street.
CHAPTER VI.
A Question of Identification.
The little man with the closely
cropped beard and hair looked at her
keenly through his gold eyeglasses. He
sat before a desk littered. all over with
papers and ofiicial looking documents.
The walls of the roc-m were lined with
shelves, on which were glas3 jars, re
torts, countless bottles and many ap
pliances of surgical science. A skele
ton was propped against the mantel
piece. The atmosphere seemed heavy
wit& the odor of drugs.
"You are Mademoiselle Pellissier?"
he asked, without rising to his feet.
Ar.na admitted the fact.
"We sent for you several hours ago,"
he remarked. : j. .â¢..;â¢
"I came directly I was disengaged,"
Anna answered. "In any case, there
is probably soir.e mistake. I have very
few friends in Paris."
He referred to a theet of paper by
his side.
"Your name and address were upon
an envelope four.d in the pocket of an
Englishman who Â»vas brought here last
night suffering from serious injuries,"
he said in a ilry official tone. "As it is
doubtful whether the man will live, we
shou!d be glad if you would Identify
him."
"It is most unlikely that I shall be
able to do so." Anna answered. "Tj
the best of my belief, I have not a
"Yes, I have heard of him, and I
know hiiri by sight." he admitted. "He
she took with her, an' uneasy conscious
ness that in this affair might lie the
germs of future trouble. .
As she crossed the square, almost
within a stone's throw of, her. lodgings,
she came face to face with Courtlaw.
He stopped short with a little excla
mation of surprise. V. . ;'
"My dear friend," she laughed, "not
so tragic, if you please.",
He recovered himself/ .
"I was surprised, I admit," he said.
"You did not tell me that you were go
ing out. or I would have offered my
escort. Dcf you know how late it is?"
"She nodded.
"I heard the clock strike as I crossed
the square," she answered. "I was sent
for to go to the Hospital St." Denis. But
what are you doing here?" .
.' "Old- Pere Runevalrmet' me : on your
doorstep, and he- would < riot let me go.
I have been sitting with him ever since.
The Hospital St. Denis, did. you say?
I Hope that no one of our friends has
met with an accident."
She shook her head. ,
"They wanted "me , to- Identify some
one whom I had certainly never seen
before in my life, and -to tell you the
truth, they were positively rude to me
because I could not. Have you ever
heard the name of Meysey Hill?"
"Meysey Hill?" He repeated it after
her, and she knew at once from his
tone and his qulckglance Into her face
that the. name possessed some signifi
cance for him. .."-./
"His voice became a shriek. In re
sponse to an almost imperative gesture
from the nurse, Anna laid her hand
upon his. He fell back upon the pil
lows with a little moan, clutching the
slim white fingers fiercely. In a mo
ment his grasp grew weaker. The per
spiration stood out upon his forehead.
His eyes closed.
Anna stepped "back at once with a
little gasp of relief. The hand which
the nian had been holding hung liiirp
and nerveless at her side. She held it
away from her with an instinctive re
pulsion," born of her unconquerable an
tipathy ttr the touch of strangers. S*he
began rubbing it with her pocket-hand
kerchief. The man himself was not a.
pleasant object. Part of his head was
swathed in linen bandages: Such of
his features as were visible were of
coarse mold. His eyes were set too
close together. Anna turned deliber
ately away from the bedside. She fol
lowed the official back into his room. Â¦'.'
"Well?" he asked her tersely.
"I can only repeat what I said be
fore," she declared. "To the best of
my belief, I have never seen the man
in my life."
"But he recognized "you," the'offlcial
objected, ; % . *
you do, Annabel. Never mind, I've got
plenty. We'll go to the shops.

leave me in this beastly thing. Anna
bel! Annabel!". . .-.
Â¦'But what^are you going to do â
where are you going to live?" Annabel
asked. "Have you any money?"
"Lots," Anna answered laconically.
"Never mind me. I always fall on my
feet, you know."
"You will let us hear from youâ let
us know-where you are, very soon?"
Annabel called out from the step.
Anna nodded as she briskly crossed
the pavement.
"Some day." she answered. "Run in
now. There's a hansom coming round
the corner." .
Annabel disappeared precipitately.
Miss Pellissler was standing at the
window of . her little- drawing-room
when her niece entered, watching the
departing cab and dabbing her eyes
with a lavender-perfumed handker
chief.
"She never looked back once. Anna
bel, not oncel" she exclaimed. "I waved
my hand, too. Really, it Is most un
fortunate that she should have come
to London just now. It is evident,
too. that she intended to stay here. Of
course, It was quite Impossible, with
Sir John here so often and feeling as
he does about her. Did she tell you her
plans, Annabel?"
The girl shook her head.
. "I'm afraid she hasn't any. - All the
same I don't think we need worry about
her, aunt.' Anna always falls upon her
feet. 1 never knew any one so capable
of looking after herself." . .
' Miss Pellissier glanced at her niece
with unaccustomed sharpness.
"I am afraid. Annabel, that you are
inclined to be a selfish young woman."
â¢ Annabel shrugged, her shoulders.
"I do not think that I am selfish In
an ordinary way," she answered. "I
simply do not worry about things. It
really is not worth while, and it makes
one old and Irritable. I would rather
have Anna here â as she has to be In
Londonâ but as it Is not possible I
simply do not think about it. I sup
pose you are going to have a really en
joyable hour now, thinking how many
scrapes &he can possibly get Into.
Every one to their taste, of course. It
simply wouldn't suit me."
"If it is not selfishness It Is just
sheer heartlessness with you, Annabel,"
Miss Pellissler declared. "I wish that
Anna had left an address. I must con
fess that I am uneasy about her. She
was always your father's favorite.
AftÂ«r all, of you two girls â "
She stopped short. looking at Anna
bel with a sudden keenness.
"Well, aunt?"
Miss Pellissier did not finish her sen
tence then, or at any other time. Nev
ertheless from that moment she was
plagued with a constantly recurring
suspicion that she was never able alto

had accepted but never understood.

It remained stationary.
Â¦Â¦Â¦. "Gracious!" she exclaimed to herself.
"I don't know where to go."
"It Is true, dear. After all there are
other things. All that I regret are the
wasted years, and I am not sure that
I regret them. Only of course I must

should happen to make him change his
mind."
"I stillââ "
Anna stopped . short. Suddenly she
understood. She grew perhaps a shade
paler, and she glanced out into the
street, where her four-wheeler cab,
laden with luggage, was still waiting.
"Sir John, of course, disapproves of
me," she remarked slowly.
"Sir John Is a man of the world," her
aunt answered coldly. "He naturally
does not wish for connections which
areâ I do not wish to hurt your feel
ings, Anna, but I must say itâ not al
together desirable."
The irrepressible smile curved Anna's
lips. She glanced toward her sister,
and curiously enough found in her face
some faint reflection of her own rather
somber mirth. She leaned back in her
chair. It was no use. The smile had
become a laugh. She laughed till the
tears stood In her eyes.
"I had a visit from Sir John In my
rooms," she said. "Did he tell you,
Annabel?"
"Yes."
"He mentioned the matter to me
also," . Miss Pellissier remarked stiffly.
"The visit seems to have made a most
painful impression upon him. To tell
you the truth, he spoke to me very se
riously upon the subject."
Anna sprang up.
."I will be off." she declared. "My
cab with all that luggage would give
the whole show away. Good-by,
aunt."
Miss Pellissler tried ineffectually to
conceal her relief.
"I do not like to seem inhospitable,
Anna," she said hesitatingly. "And of
course you are my niece Just as Anna
bel is, although I am sorry to learn
that your conduct has been much less
discreet than hers. But at the same
time, I must say plainly that I think
your presence here Just now would be
a. great misfortune. I wish very much
that you had written fSefore leaving
Paris." : ! -i?f-J'r ~~'<p
Anna nodded.
"Quite right," she said. "I ought to
have done. Good-by, aunt. 1 11 come
and see you again later on. Annabel,
come to the door with me," she added
a little abruptly. "There Is something
which I must say to you."
Annabel pose and followed her sister
from the room. A maid-servant held
the front door open. Anna sent her
away.
"Annabel," she Â¦Â¦â¢ said brusquely.
"Listen to me."
. "Well?" : v v ~
"Sir John came to me â that you
know â and you can guess what I told
him. No, never mind about thanking
me. I want to ask you a plain ques
tion, and you must answer me faith
fully. Is all that folly done withâ for
ever?" â¢ - - -' Â¦
Annabel shivered ever so slightly.
"Of course it is, Anna. You ought to
know that. I am going to make a fresh
start."
"Be very sure that you do," Anna
said slowly. "If I thought for a moment
that there was any.chance of a relapse
I should Â¦ stop here and tell him the
truth even now." ' ;
Annabel looked at her with terrified
eyes. \
"Anna," she cried. "You must be
lieve me. I am really in earnest. I
would not have him know â now â for
the world." %
"Very well," Anna said. "I will be

all a bad sort, and to speak frankly,
he's your salvation. .Try and let him
never regret It. There's plenty to be
got out of Jife in a decent sort of way.

you will."
"I promise," Annabel declared. "He
Is very kind, Anna, really, and not half
such a prig as he seems."
Anna moved towards the door, but
her sister detained her.
"Won't you tell me why you have
come to England? ' she said. "It was
such a surprise to see you. I thought
that you loved Paris and your work
so much."
. A momentary bitterness crept into
Anna's tone. j
Â¦ :"I have made no progress with my
work," she said slowly, "and the money
was gone. I had to ask Mr. Courtlaw
for his true verdict, and he gave it
me. I have given up painting."
"Anna!"

"He fancied that he did," she cor
rected him coolly. "I suppose delusions
are not uncommon to patients in his
condition." V . Â»-
The official frowned.
"Your name and address In his pocket
was no delusion," he said sharply. ."I
do not wish to make Impertinent in

is of any concern of ours except the
discovery of the man's identity. He

"You are' very unbelieving," Anna
said coldly. "I hope you will not com
pel me to say again that I do not know
the man's name, nor, to the best of my
belief, have I ever seen him before In
my life." . â¢
The official sh/ugged his shoulders.
"You decline to help us in any way,
then," he said. , "Remember that the
man will probably die. He had little
money about: him, and. unless friends
come to his aid he must be treated as
a pauper."
"I do not wish to seem unfeeling,"
Anna said, slowly, "but I can only re
peat that I am absolutely without con
cern in the matter. , The man is; a
stranger to me."
The' official had no more to say. Only
It was with a further and most unbe
lieving shrug of the shoulders that he
resumed his seat â¢
"You will -be so good as to leave us
your correct name and address, made

- "You , have .' them ' both," Anna an

He opened . the door . for her with a
faint disagreeable smile.

said, "that. this. affalrj Is not yet; ended.

She passed out without reply. Yet

Anna had reached the house where
she lodged, but she hesitated â¢ on the
doorstep. â¢
"Have you ever seen Annabel with

"Never."
"It Is odd that this, man at thehos

she remarked.

"I never heard her mention'-, his

"How long had he been In the hos
pital # ?" Courtlaw asked. Â¦ .
"Si'nce last night."
"Sir "John," her aunt repeated, with
thin emphasis, "is coming to see your
sister."
Anna drummed Impatiently with her
fingers against the arm of. her chair. 1
"Well!" she declared good-humor
edly. "I shan't eat him."
Miss Pellissler stiffened visibly.
"This Â¦ is not a matter altogether for
levity, Anna," she, said. "Your sister's
future. is at stake. I imagine that even
you must : realize that this is of some
Importance." . ,
Anna glanced toward her sister, but
the latter avoided her eyes. .. .
"I have always," she admitted calm
ly, >!'taken a certain amount of Interest
in - Annabel's . future. /I * should like to
know how it Is concerned with. Sir John
Ferringhall, and how my presence in
tervenes."
"Sir John," Miss Pelllssler . said im
pressively, "has asked your* sister to be
his wife.; It, Is a most wonderful piece
of â¢ good â¢ fortune, - as' I suppose you will

"I will accept that," Anna said, "as

Miss Pelllssler/ was beginning to re
cover, herself. Â° She, too . at once devel
oped an anxious interest in the street
outside. . ">. :
. ''I am , sure, Anna,", she said, "I do
not see why we . should conceal the
truth from you! We are expecting" a
visit from Sir John Ferrlnghall at any
moment. He is coming here to tea."
"Well?" Anna remarked calmly.
single English acquaintance In the
city."
"My dear young lady," the official
said irritably, "this man would not
have your name and address in his
pocket without an object. You cannot
tell whether you know him or not until
you have seen him. Be bo good as to
come this way."
With a little shrug of the shoulders
Anna followed him. They ascended by
a lift to one of the upper floors, passed
through a long ward, and finally came
to a bed In the extreme corner, round
which a screen had been arranged. A
nurse came hurrying up.
"He is quiet only this minute," she
said to the official. "All the time he is
shouting and muttering. 11 If this is the
young lady, she can perhaps calm
him."
Anna stepped to the foot of the bed.
An electric light flashed out from the
wall. The face of the man who lay
there was clearly visible. Anna merely
glanced at the coarse, flushed features,
and at once shook her head.
"I have never seen him in my life,"
she said to the official. "I have not
the least idea who he is."
Just then the man's eyes opened. He
saw the girl, and sprang up In bed.
"Annabel at last," he shouted.
"Where have you been? All these
hours I have been calling for you.
Annabel, I was lying. Whio says that I
am not Meysey Hill? I was trying to
scare you. See, it is on my cardsâ M.

Anna stepped back : bewildered, but
the man held out his arms to 'her.
"I tell you it was a lie!" he shouted
wildly. "Can't you. believe me? I am
Meysey Hill. I am the richest man In
England. I am the richest man in the
world. - You love "money. You know
The cabman, knocking with the butt
end of his whip upon the window, re
minded her that he was In a similar
predicament.
"Drive towards St Pancras," she di
rected, promptly. "I will U0t you when
to stop."
The cab rumbled off. Anna leaned
forward, watching the people in the
streets. It was then for the first time
she remembered that she had said
nothing to her sister of the man In tha
hospital. >
CHAPTER VIII.
"White's."
Northwards, away from the inhos
pltality of "West Kensington, rumbled
the ancient four-weeled cab, laden
with luggage end drawn by a wheezy
old horse rapidly approaching its last
days. Inside was Anna, leaning a lit
tle fcrrward to watch the passers-by,
bright-eyed, full to the brim of the in
satiable curiosity of youth â the desire
to understand and appreciate this new
world in which she found herself. She
was practically an outcast, she had not
even the ghost of a plan as to her fu
ture, and she had something less than
five pounds in hec pocket. She watched
the people and hummed softly to- her
self./
Suddenly she thrust her head out of
the window.
"Please stop, cabman." she ordered.
The man pulled up. It was not a dif
ficult affair.
"Is this Montague street. TV. C.r*
she asked.
The man looked as though he would
have liked to deny it, but could not.
, "Stay where you are for a mt-ment,"
she directed. "I want to Had an ad
dress."
The man contented himself with a
nod. Anna rummaged about In her
dressing case and finally drew out a
letter. On the envelope was writtenâ
SYDNEY COURTLAW, Esq..
13 Montague St.
Sh<> put her h< ad out of the window.
"Number 13. please, cabman."
"We've come past it. miss," the man
answered with a note of finality in his
gruff voice.
"Then turn round and go back there,"
she directed.
The man muttered something In
audihle, anS gathered up the reins.
His horse, which had apparently gone
to sleep, preferred to remain where he
was. After a certain amount of ma
neuvering, however, he was induced to
crawl around, and in a few minutes
came to a stop again before a tall,
brightly painted house, which seemed
like an oasis of color and assertive
prosperity in a long dingy row. This
was number 13 Montague street, famil
iarly spoken of in the neighborhood as
"White's."./-,.
Anna promptly alighted with the let
ter in her band. The door was opened
for her by a weary-looking youth In a
striped jacket several sizes too. large
for him. The rest of his attire was
nondescript.
"Does Mr. Courtlaw, Mr. Sydney
Courtlaw. live here, please?" Anna
asked him.
"Not home yet, miss," the young man
replied. "Generally gets here about 7."
Anna hesitated and then held out the
letter.
"I think that I will leave this letter
for him," she said. "It Is from his
brother in Paris. Say that I will call
again or let him know my address In
London."
The young man accepted the latter
and the message, and seemed about to
close the door when a lady issued from
one of the front rooms and intervened,
She wore a black satin dress, a little
shiny at the seams, a purposeless bow
of white tulle at the back of her neck
and a huge chatelaine. She addressed
Anna with a beaming smile and a very
creditable mixture of condescension and
offlciousness. Under the somewhat
trying incandescent light her checks
pleaded guilty to a recent use of the
powder puff.
"I think that you were Inquiring for
Mr. Courtlaw." she remarked. "He la
one of our guests â perhaps I should
say boarders here, but he seldom re
turns before dinner time. We dine at
7:30. Can I give him any message for

"Thank you," Anna answered. "X
have a letter for him from his brother,
which I was Just leaving."
"I will see that he gets it Immediately
on his return," the lady promised.
"You did not wish to see him particu
larly this evening, then?"
Anna hesitated.
"Well, no," she answered. "TÂ» tsQ
you the truth though, I am quite a
stranger In London, and It occurred
to me that Mr. Courtlaw might have
been able to give me an idea where tÂ»
stop."
The lady In black satin looked at the
pile of luggage outside and hesitated.
"Were you thinking of private apart*
ments, a boarding-house or a hotelt"
she asked.
"I really had not thought about it at
all," Anna answered, smiling. "I ex
pected to stay with a relation, but I
found that their arrangements did not
allow of it. I have been used to living
in apartments in Paris, but I suppose
the system is different here."
The lady in black satin appeared un
decided. She looked from Anna, wha
was far too nice looklnsr to be traveling
about alone, to that reassuring pile of
luggage, and wrinkled her brows
thoughtfully.
"Of course," she. said diffidently*
"this Is a boarding-house, although we
never take In promiscuous travelers.
The class of guests we have axe all
permanent, and I am obliged to be
very careful indeed. But â If you are
a friend of Mr. Courtlaw'sâ I should
like to oblige Mr. Courtlaw."
"It Is very nice of you to think Â«f
it." Anna said briskly. "I should really
like to find somewhere to stay, If It was
only for a few nights."
The lady stood away from the dooiv
"Will vou come this way." she said,
"Into the drawing-room? There 1b urn
one there Just now. Most of my peo
ple are upstairs dressing for dinner.
The gentlemen are so particular now,
and a good thing, too, I say. I was
always used to it. and I think It gives
quite a tone to an establishment.
Please sit down. Missâ dear me, 1
haven't asked your name yet."
"My name Is Pellissler." Anna taldj
"Anna Pellissler."
"I am Mrs. White." the.lady In black
Â¦atin remarked. "It makes one feel
quite awkward - to mention such a
thing, but after all I think that It t*
best for both parties. > Could you fTrÂ«
me any references?"
' '"there Is Mr. Courtlaw," Anna said,
"ana my solicitors, Messrs. Le Mardar
& Stowe of St. Hellers. They are rathe*
a long way off. but you could write tÂ»
them. I am sorrv that I do not know
any one In London. But after all, Mrs.
White, I am not at all sure that I could
afford to come to you. I am shock
ingly poor. Please tell me what your
terms are." " -
"Well." Mrs. White said slowly, "It
depends a good deal upon what room
you have. Just now my best ones are
all taken."
"So much the better." Anna declared
cheerfully. "The smallest win d* tor
me quite* well."
Mrs. White looked mystertonsgy
about the room as though to be sura
that no one was listening.
"I should like you to come here," Â«he
said. "It's a great deal for a young
lady who's alone in the world, as I
suppose you are at present, to have a
respectable home, apd I do not think
in such a case that private apartments
are at all desirable. We have a rery
nice set of young people here, too. Just
at present, and you would soon mak*
some friends. I will take yon for
thlrty-flve shillings a week- Fleas*
don't let any one know that. _
"I have no idea what It costs to arm
In London," Anna said, "bat I shfrnl* ,
3"Will you tell me." she exclaimed,
leaning forward and touching Brendon
upon the arm. "Why do not the people
laugh? They have finished their day's
work â this is their relaxation. Why do
they not talk to one another and be
happy? Look along this row, and
that," she exclaimed, motioning: with
her hand. "Is it a matter of con
science or digestion, or what?"
"Of temperament only," Brendon as
sured her. "Englishmen are proverbial,
you know, for taking their pleasures
sadly."
"Sadly! What a hideous philosophy.
We shall become a nation of dyspeptics.
How can an artist sing or dance to
such a wooden wall? Ah!"
Her eyes twinkled with fun. She
was leaning over and looking into the
stalls. Sir John, white gloved,
white waistcoated, curled and
debonair, was whispering into
Annabel's ear, while Miss Pel
lissier on the . next seat affected to
be absorbed in her programme.
"Oh, this is funny," Anna murmur
ed. "I am so glad we came here."
"Do tell us the joke," Sydney Court
law begged.
She shook her head regretfully, v
"It is too bad," she declared. "I can
not! But you must tell me this. Is it
supposed in this dear, hypocritical old
city to be quite respectable to be In the
two shilling places at the Empire?".
Brendon smiled.
They found their way to a music
hall. Seated high up near the ceiling
â she had insisted upon cheap places â
Anna, whose appetite for fresh things
was as the appetite of a child, in
fected her two escorts with something
of her own gayety. Even on her first
night she saw many things which
moved her to wonder.
Some Confidences and a Supper.
CHAPTER IX.
"When they get the chance. It really
isn't so easy as it seems. We have
come to the, conclusionâ Brendon and
Iâ that Mrs. White is psychologically
gifted. She throws a sort of spell over
us all. We struggle against It at first,
but in the end we have to submit. She
calls us her guests, but in reality we
are her prisoners. We simply can't get
away. There's the old gentleman at
the end of the table â Building is his
name. He will tell you confidentially
that he simply hates the place. Yet
he's been here for six years, and he's
-is much a fixture as that sham ma
hogany Eideboard. Every one will
crumble to you confidentiallyâ Miss El
licot, she's our swagger young lady,
you knÂ«w, up there, next Mrs. White;
she will tell you that it's so out of
the world here â so far away from every
one one knows. Old Kesterton, choleric
looking individual nearly opposite, will
curse the cooking: till he's black in the
like very much to come for a short time
if I might."
"Certainly." Mrs. White said. "Two
days' notice shall be suScient on either
side."
"And I may bring my luggage in and
seed that cabman away?" Ar.na asked.
"Dear me. what a relief! If I had had
any nerves that man would have
trampled upon them long ago."
"Cabmen are eo trying." Mrs. White
assented. -You need have no further
trouble. The man servant shall bring
yuur trunks in and pay the fare, too,
\l you like."
Anna drew out her purse at once.
"You are really a good Samaritan."
Ehe declared. "I am perfectly certain
that that man meant to be rude to me.
He has been bottling it up all the way
from West Kensington."
Mrs. White rang the belL
"Come upstairs," she said, "and I
will show you your room. And would
you mind hurrying a little. You won't
Â¦want to be late the first evening, and
it's ten minutes past seven now. Gra
cious, there's the gong. This way, my
dear â and â you'll excuse my mention
ing it, but a quiet blouse and a little
chiffon, you know, will be* quite suffi
cient. It's your first evening, and early
impressions do count for so much. You
â¢understand me, I'm sure."
Anna was a little puzzled, but she
only laughed.
"Perhaps, as I've only Just arrived,"
she remarked, "I might be forgiven if
I do not change my skirt. I packed so
hurriedly that It will take me a long
time to find my things."
"Certainly," Mrs. White assured her.
"Certainly. I'll mention It. You're
tired, of course. This is your room.
The gong will go at seven-thirty. Don't
be late if you can help it."
Anna was not late, but her heart
eank within her when she entered the
drawing-room. It was not a hopeful
looking group. Two or three podgy
looking old men with wives to match,
half a dozen overdressed girls and a
couple of underdressed American ones,
who still wore the clothes in which
they had been tramping half over Lon
don since breakfast time. A sprink
ling of callow youths and a couple of
pronounced young Jews, who were
talking loudly together in some unin
telligible Jargon of the city. What had
she to do with such as these? She had
hard work to keep a smiling face, as
Mrs. White, who had risen to greet
her, proceeded with a formal and, from
Anna's point of view, a wholly unnec
essary round of introductions. And
then suddenly â a relief. A young man
âalmost a boy, slight, dark, and with
his brother's deep gray . eyes â came
across the room to her.
"You must be the Miss Pellissier of
whom David has told me so much," he
said, shyly. "I am very glad that you
have come here. I heard from David
about you only this morning."
"You are marvelously like your
brother," Anna said, beaming upon
him. "I have a letter for you, and no
end of messages. Where can we sit
down and talk?"
He led her across the room toward
a window recess, in which a tall, fair
young man was seated with an even
ing paper in his hand.
"Let me introduce my friend to you,"
Courtlaw said. "Arthur, this is Miss
Pellissierâ Mr. Brendon. Brendon and
I are great chums," he went on ner
vously. "I don't think that the rest of
the people here like us very well, do
they, Arthur, so we're obliged to be
friends."
Anna shook hands with Brendonâ a
young man also, but older and more
self-possessed than Sydney Courtlaw.
"Sydney is quite right. Miss Pellis
sier," he said. "He and I don't seem
to get on at all with our fellow-guests,
as Mrs. White calls them. You really
ought not to stay here and talk to us.
It is a most Inauspicious start for
you."
"Dear me," Anna laughed, "how un
fortunate! What ought I to dp?
Should I be forgiven, do you think, if I
were to go and hold that skein of wool
for the old lady in the yellow cap?"
"Don't speak of her irreverently,"
Brendon said, in an awed whisper.
"Her husband was a county councilor,
and Ehe has a niece who comes to see
her in a carriage. I wish she wouldn't
look like that at us over her glasses."
Horace, the man servant, transform
ed now Into the semblance of a correct
ly garbed waiter, threw open the door.
"Dinner Is served, ma'am," he an
nounced to Mrs. White.
There was no rush. Everything was
done in a genteel and ordinary way;
but, on the other hand, there was no
lingering. Anna found herself next
Sydney Courtlaw, with his friend close
at hand. Opposite to her was a sallow
visag-ed young man, whose small tie
seemed like a smudge of obtrusively
ehiny black across the front of a high,
close-drawn collar. As a rule. Court
law told her softly, he talked right and
left and to everybody throughout the
.whole of the meaL To-night he was al
most silent and seemed to devote his
whole attention to staring at Anna.
After the first courses, however, she
scarcely noticed him. Her two new
friends did their best to entertain her.
"I can't imagine. Miss Pellissier,"
Brendon said, leaning toward her,
"whatever made you think of coming
to stay if only for a week at a Monta
gue-street boarding-house. Are you
going to write a novel?"
"Not L" she answered gayly. "I came
to London unexpectedly and my friends
could not take me In. I had a vague
sort of idea that this was the region
where one finds apartments, so I told
ray cabman to drive in this direction
while I sat inside the vehicle and en
deavored to form a plan of campaign.
He brought me past this house, and I
thought I would call and leave your
brother's letter. Then I caw Mrs.
Whiteâ"
"No more," Sydney Courtlaw begged,
laughingly. "You were booked, of
course. An unexpected vacancy,
wasn't it? Every one comes In on un
expected vacancy."
"And they go?"
"The pleasantest things In the world,"
Brendon answered, "become drudgery
when one has to do them."
"That is ay very well," Anna de
clared, "but 'flurely the things which
appeal most to one are the things one
is likely to do best"
"It is an admirable theory," Brendon
said slowly. "The pity of it is that It
so seldom works out in actual life."
"Theories won't work themselves
out," Anna declared lightly. "If we
don't make them prove themselves the
fault is often our own. Isn't it? Please
ask for the bill, ; Sydney. I really can't
call you Mr. Courtlaw, you know, after
having called your brother that for so
long. This place Is garish. It makes
my eyes and my head ache."
They passed out into the cool streets.
Anna drew a little sigh of relief.
"Ah, this is better," she exclaimed.
"Don't let us hurry home. I want to
look about me. Streets, streets, streets!
Is there no green anywhere to rest
one's eyes?"
They took her into Piccadilly and
walked slowly along under the trees
of the green park. She piled them
with numberless questions. There were
so many nhases of / life ' which were
strange to her, so milch that she want
ed to understand. But in the middle
of an animated conversation she sud
denly stopped short upon the pavement.
They were under the portico of a
celebrated restaurant, from which the
"I sit at the next desk," Sydney an
swered. "Only, of course, I'm Bren
don's Junior by a good bit. I wanted to
be an artist like David, but I came to
grief." '
"So did I." Anna declared. "Your
brother knocked all that out of me."
Sydney was incredulous.
"David doesn't often make mistakes,"
he said, "but â "
"He made no mistake about me,"
Anna declared. "I do not believe that I
have even the temperament of an artist.
I shall always be thankful to him for
beingâ wellâ brutally frank to me. . It
is such a waste of time, isn't It, ham
mering away at something which is not
one's metier."
Brendon sighed.
"There are very many of us," he said.
"who have all our lives to be doing that
sort of thing."
"If one knows It," Anna said, "there
Is always a means of escape."
"Some of us," Brendon answered dry
ly, "have our livings to earn."
Anna laughed, and laughed again to
herself softly. How about herself? She
had barely sufficient money In her
purse â in the world â to keep her for a
week. Yet her face was bravely enough
set toward the future. Its very difficul
ties were an inspiration.
"I really do not see," she said, "why
one should not be able to earn one's
living in a pleasant way."
"I can guess," Anna answered. "I
suppose it Is very Interesting. It sounds
a littleâ"
"It not only sounds, but it is," Bren
don interrupted, "a deadly' grind."
"And Sydney?"
"But what manner of people are
these?" she asked. "Where do they
come from? Have they been dug out
of the country places? Are they really
Londoners?"
"Nine-tenths of them," Brendon an
swered. "Perhaps more. But you
must remember that this is a cheap
place."
"Of course. It is what I wanted. I
wanted to see the small shopkeeper
and his wife, the working girls and
their beauxâ the lower middle classes."
"They are here," Brendon answered.
"You can pick them out easily enough.
They are jumbled up with the flotsam
from the streets and they probably
feel for an hour or two that they are
leading terrible lives."
"And the artists?" Anna asked.
"Where do they go to? What Is their
quarter?"
Brendon laughed.
"I think," he said, "that our artists
are like our soldiers â they loathe the
signs of their calling and come out al
ways in mufti. You find the successful
ones at the smart restaurants, the me
diocre ones at the artists' clubs and the
failures on the streets. They are not
to be distinguished as in Paris. They
form no society of their own. They
take their, place in the great world ac
cording to their standing, and like all
other Englishmen they aim in their
clothing and speech and deportment at
the great negative manner." / â¢
"Which means," Sydney .remarked,
"the deletion of- all individuality. 1^ It
is good for the hairdresser."/
"Dear me," Anna murmured. VWhat
a lot I am learning about my country
people! Now tell me, pleaee, if I am
not too' Inquisitive, what do you two
boys do? You work, I suppose?"
"Thank you, Miss Pellissier," Bren
don remarked. "It 13 a good many years
since I have been called a boy. I am
a clerk in a bank, If you know what
that is."
"I am not sure," he said, "but that
thjs J3 i:ot the most respectable part
in*' the hc-jse. Certainly we could give
points to th2 stalls." j
Anna sighed. She seemed disap
pointed.
"All the same," she murmured to
herself, "I wish that Sir John could
see us."
Afterward she insisted upon sup
per, and on being hostess. '
"Somewhere ridiculously cheap," she
said, briskly. "Somewhere where there
are a great many people' to be seen."
They took her to Prascati's, protest-
Ing firmly all <he way against being
her guests. But she was firm.
"After to-night," she declared, "we
will all share up. It is the possi
ble way, if you will bring me out with
you' sometimes. But to-nightâ no. I
must be hostess. I have the whim for
it. Mrs. White has started all the
quicksilver in me, somehow. What a
dinner â and what people!"
"You will never stay there," they
both declared, in despair.
"Oh, I am not so sure," ehe answered
cheerfully. "One can amuse "oneself
anywhere, and if you two are nice to
meâ who knows? I am enjoying this
evening immensely, but if I do not
hear one real laugh at supper-time I
shalr have hysterics. What do they do
with their spirits, these people? Do
they bottle them up? They talkâ their
lips seem to be moving always, but
their faces are dead."
Wherever they went Anna attracted
attention. Her unusual beauty, the
distinction of her quiet clothes and
elegant carriage, the Madonna-like
calm of her features, broken up every
now and then by the restless fire of
her lips and eyes, seemed to turn peo
ple's heads toward her in the street,
the theater and the restaurant. - And
withal she was possessed of the most
sublime unconsciousness. She seemed
positively ignorant of the fact that she
was In any way distinguished from the
crowd. But when they were seated in
the restaurant* she certainly gazed
about her with something akin to won
der. . . â¢
Mrs. White gasped, and then stiff
ened. Miss Ellicot, who sang ballads
and liked Brandon to turn over the
pages for her, tossed her head. Anna
passed serenely out.
"Thanks, I'm not very fond of cof
fee," Anna answered, "and I "hate
music. Good night."
Anna laid down her serviette.
"Let us escape," she said. "Couldn't
we three go out and have some coffee
somewhere? The thought of v that
drawing-room paralyzes me."-
Brendon laughed softly.
"We can," he said, "and we will. But
it is only fair to warn you that it isn't
expected. Mrs. White is proud of her
drawing-room evenings. There Is a
musical programme, and we have the
windows open and the blinds up, and
a pink lamp shade over the piano
lamp â a sort of advertisement of the
place, you know. Strangers look in
and long, and neighbors are moved to
envy."
Anna hesitated- no longer. She al-.
most sprang to her feet. Conscious of
Mrs. White's surprise as she swung
easily down the room, followed by the
two young men, she smiled a careless
explanation at her.
"I am dying to renew my acquaint
ance with London, Mrs. White," she
remarked.
"You are not going outâ this evening,
I trust," that lady asked, a trifle dis
mayed.
Anna did not pause, but she lboked
over her shoulder with slightly lifted
eyebrows.
"Why not? They tell me that London
is impossible till after 10, and I want
my first impressions to be favorable."
"There will be some coffee and music
In the drawing-room in a few minutes,"
Mrs. White said.
"A volatile temperament â yes, a vol
atile temperament," Mr. Building re
peated, rather struck with the phrase.
"It is a pity that as nations we are not
more friendly."
Anna nodded and turned again to
Courtlaw.
"I will not be drawn into a conversa
tion with Mr. Building," she declared.
"I believe that he would bore me. Tell
me, what are these bananas and nuts
for?"
"Dessert."
"It takes a great deal of bad weather
to depress the true Parisian," Anna
admitted.
Brendon leaned over confidentially.
"You are in luck. Miss Pellissier," he
declared. "Your success here is abso
lutely meteoric MJÂ£S Ellicot has
spoken to you, the great Mr. Building
is going to. For five minutes he has
been trying to think of something to
say. m I am not sure, but I believe that
he has Just thought of something."
"May I be prepared?" Anrfa asked.
"Which Is Mr. Building?"
"Stout old gentleman four places
down on the left. Look out, it's com
ing."
Anna raised her eyes and caught the
earnest gaze of an elderly gentleman
with a double chin, a protuberant un
der lip and a snuff-stained coat.
"I was in Paris four years ago," Mr.
Building announced solemnly. "It
rained the whole of the time, but we
saw all the sights and the place never
seemed dull."
"I have come from a very unfashion
able quarter," she said, "and I do not
think that I have been inside a milli
ner's shop for a year. Besides, it is all
reversed now, vou know. Paris copies
London."
The young lady with frizzled hair,
whom Brendon had pointed out to her
as Miss Ellicot, leaned forward from
her hostess' side. She had very frizzy
hair indeed, very black eyebrows, a
profusion of metallic adornments about
her neck and waist and an engaging
smile.
"We are so interested to hear. Miss
Pellissier," she said, "that you have
been living in Paris. We shall expect
you to tell us all what to wear."
Anna smiled very faintly and shook
her head. *"
Brendon laughed.
"Oh, we are also under the spell," he
declared, "but I think that we are
here mainly because it is cheap. It is
really cheap, you know. To appre
ciate it you should try rooms."
"Is this a fair sample of the din
ner?" Anna asked, who had the
healthy appetite of a strong young
woman.
"It is. if anything, a little above the
average," Brendon admitted. ,
Anna said nothing. The young man
opposite was straining his ears to lis
ten to their conversation. Mrs. White
caught her eye and smiled benignly
down the table.
"I hope that Mr. Courtlaw Is looking
after you. Miss Pellissier," she said.
"Admirably, thank you/' Anna an
swered.
fare, but he never misses a dinner. The
Semitic-looking young man opposite,
who EMms to have Deen committms
you to memory piecemeal, will tell you
i hat he was never so bored in all his
Ure as he has L<;ea here. Yet he stays.
They all stay!"
"And you yourself ?"
"I am afraid that you are making a
mistake," she said. "I was never at
any such dinner, and I am quite sure
that I do hot know you."
"Perhaps you remember me, Miss
Pellissier," the second young man in
terposed. "I had the pleasure of â er
âmeeting you more than once. I be
lieve."
(Continued next Sunday.)
Anna had suddenly stiffened. She
regarded the young man coldly. Her
tone was icy.
VThis," Anna declared, as she sipped
her wine and looked around her, "re
minds me more of Paris than any
place I have yet seen. I suppose it Is
the mirrors and decorations."
"And the people?" Brendon asked.
"What do you think of them?"
Anna extended her critical survey
and shrugged her shoulders.
"What can one say?" she ex
claimed. "Did you ever see women
so weary-looking and so dowdy? They
do not talk. They seem to spend their
time yawning and inspecting their
neighbor's dresses through those hate
ful glasses. It never seems to enter
their heads to try and amuse their
menkind."
. "I guess they want a few more
American women here," Sydney re
marked. "I can see what you mean.
There's a sort of frozen way about bo
many of these English people."
Anna nodded.
"After all," she said, "I suppose it
is because we do not understand what
is correct. Vivacity is no doubt bad
form. But why people come to such
places if they do not mean to enjoy
themselves I cannot imagine."
"To show their Jewels and their
husbands to their enemies," Brendoa
remarked.
"Poor husbands," Anna exclaimed
compassionately. "Some day they will
rebel. I believe that my sympathies
will not be with my sex."
Two young men on their way down
the room came suddenly to a stand
still before Anna. The foremost, tall,
clean-shaven, perfectly .groomed, half
extended his hand with a smile of re
cognition.
"Miss Pelllssler, isn't it?" he said.
"Glad to see you in London. No idea
that you were here, though."
Anna looked up with a doubtful
smile of non-recognition.
"My name is certainly Pellissier,'*
she said, "but I am very sorry â I do
not recognize you in the least,"
The tall young man dropped his
eyeglass and smiled.
"Had the pleasure of dining with,
you, at the Embassador's one night
before the show, you know â last Sep
tember I think It was. Charley Peve
nill was our host. My name is Army
tage â Lord Ernest Armytagre."
An Encounter at the Carlton.
CHAPTER XI.
The letter dropped from her fingers.
Anna was alone and the mask of her
unchanging high spirits was for the
moment laid aside. . She was a little
paler than when she had come to Lon
don, a little paler and a little thinner.
There were dark rims under her eyes,
soft now with unshed tears. For this
three weeks . had been the hardest of
her life. There had been disappoint
ments and humiliations, and although
she hated to admit it even to herself,
she was in desperate straits. Never
theless, she was still fighting. She
drew pen and paper toward her and
clenched her teeth as she wrote:
"Dear Friend â What nonsense!
Ycur words scarcely even hastened my
decision. For months I had ..been
struggling with that hideous inability,
to express a single coherent thing*
with a dead brush and stiff fingers. In
all our friendship there is nothing for
which I have felt more grateful to you
than when you paid me the rare com
pliment' of telling me an unpleasant
truth. â¢
"Why should you think and write
of me as an outcast? Believe me, life
is very amusing here. I have "not final
ly settled which of the arts or profes
sions shall have - the honor of provid
ing me with my daily bread, but that
will come. â¢ One thing, however, I have
finally decided. I have put. my
brushes away, absolutely and inevit
ably, at any rate for , the present.
Nothing shall induce me to change my
mind as regards' this. Nor shall I for
some time at any rate return to Paris.
You know, dear friend, that neither
my instincts nor my training incline
toward the conventional, but when you
write to me as though you were in

"I cannot : picture you in a Mon

here, Anna! A thousand times I have
felt like biting out my tongue which
sent you into such ridiculous and in

and I will force the genius which is
in you out of your fingers on to can

seriously. They Were not meant to be

"DAVID COURTLAW."
CIUPTER X.
Brendon's Luck.
PARIS, 15 th -.
smart you and Mr. Ccurtlaw look this
evening!" she added. I suppose you
are off to celebrate somewhere?"
"We are going out to supper," Bren
don answered. "I am only sorry we
can't take the whole lot of ycu," he
added pleasantly.
"How nice of you!" Mrs. White mur
mured.
"Eighteen*would be rather too many,
wouldn't it?" Miss Ellicot remarked,
with a little conscious smile. "I tnink
supper parties are such fun."
"We thought of going to the Carl
ton," Brendon said:
"Oh!" Miss Ellicott's interjection
was long drawn and expressive. "How
perfectly lovely! It's the one place in
the world I am dying to see. Do look
around at all the people and the
dresses, and find out who Is there, and
describe it all to us poor stay-at-homes
to-morrow. Oh!"
This second interjection was of a
different character. Anna stood upon
the threshold buttoning her gloves, and
something very like sensation rippled
from one to the other. They had none
of them seen Anna in evening dress.
They had probably never been in the
same room with a black gown fash
ioned by an expert Parisian dress
maker. She wore no Jewels. Her neck
and arms were bare. Her wonderful
brown hair, curving low over her fore
head, was drawn back with a grace
which a professional coiffeur could
scarcely have matched. Even her pal
lor seemed to add to that marvelous
distinction of presence, so subtle and
yet so unmistakable a gift. The women
felt suddenly tawdry and old-fash
ioned. Miss Ellicot lost all faith in the
blouse which a few momenta ago had
given her every satisfaction, and as for
her ornaments, she could have torn
them from her neck and arms and
thrown them Into the fireplace. She
went slowly red and then pale. She
had lost her place at 13 Montague
street. She was wholly and entirely
eclipsed. There was not a male pair of
eyes In the place which were not chin
ing with admiration.
Anna, utterly unconscious, or at any
rate indifferent to the sensation which
she had evoked, came a little further
into the room.
"Mr. Brendon Is going to take us to
the Carlton," she remarked pleasantly
to Mrs. White. "Isn't it nice of him?"
"Very," Mrs. White answered, with
some reserve. "Are you sure that you
won't catch cold with nothing on your
shoulders?"
"Well, I shall have to risk It." Anna
declared, with a soft little laugh. "I
don't possess an opera cloak."
Miss Ellicot rose heroically.
?*I will lend you mine," she said. "I
don't think you ought to. go out like
that."
Anna, who had seen Miss Ellicot's
opera cloak, stopped her.
"It is so nice of you," she said, "but
I really do not need it. I have a piece
of lace outside I can twist round my
head and shoulders. I am quite ready
now, Mr. Brendon. Good-night, every
body."
They departed, leaving behind them,
almost a dead silence. Mr. Gudden
had done nothing but simply stare at
Anna from the moment of her en
trance. Even after her departure he
remained looking at the door through
which she had issued.
Miss Ellicot broke the spelL
"Well," she said Impressively.
"What there was about that dress, I
can't imagine, except that it seemed
more like a skin than anything, but
I never saw anything look so Indecent
in my life."
"She looked like one of those new
fashioned posters," Mrs. White re
marked, "or like one of those French,
women who come over to the music
halls, and drive about with mules and
poodles with diamond bracelets."
Every one had something to say.
Mr. Gudden alone was silent- He had
removed to a distant window, and was
standing there with folded arms.
"If I can't remember where I've
seen her, who she is in two minutes,"
he murmured to himself, "I shall have
fits. S'help me I shall."
The carriage vanished round a cor
ner. Something which looked like a
white handkerchief fluttered from the
window. For a few moments Anna re
mained silent. Her high spirits nagged.
They walked aimlessly along/ the two
young men glancing furtively at one
another. Then with a little exclama
tion she recovered herself.
"Dear me, how absurd!" she ex
claimed. "As if London were not large
enough for both of us. Please tell me,
Mr. Brendon, ought we to be out so
late as this? Will Mrs. White give me
notice?"
"We have latchkeys," they both as
sured her.
She smiled. .
"Capital! Don't hurry then. I like
to look around me."
So they threaded their way through
the loitering groups of men and wo
men. Anna frequently paused . to look
about her, often perplexed, more than
once astonished.
: "I do not understand these pedple at
all," she declared. "There are none
who seem realty to be enjoying them
selves, except those who have had too
much to drink. All these others, they
come from their evening's pleasure as
though from hours of labor."
"The Londoner and the Parisian are
as far apart as the poles," Sydney re
minded her. "The Parisian hums a gay
tune as he walks homeward Â«and
thinks over his evening's entertain
ment. The Englishman wonders how
he will sleep, thinks of the morrow's
work, and leckons up how much his
evening's pleasure has cost him."
Anna shrugged her shoulders.
"Don't ask me to be patriotic, then,"
she remarked. "And yet, you know,
one feels nearer to life here. Levity
fits the Parisian like a glove, his very
capacity for it seems belittling. See
how different it is here, what a strug
gle it all is to appear light hearted.
The forced 6mile cracks the rouge on
these women's cheeks. It is hideously
unnatural, one feels conscious all the
time of the tragedy underneath. And
the men, - those who are not flushed
with wine, are dull-footed, pale. They
come and go like spectral figures. One
feels that they are only adding to the
toils. of the day In this half-hearted
pursuit of relaxation."
Brendon looked at her curiously.
"I wonder," he. said, "is this the cyn
icism of the very young, or do we real
ly seem like it to you?"
"I am not young," Anna answered,
"and I am not a cynic. If I am unjust
I shall find it out very soon. I simply
speak of things as I see them."
Brendon, with regret, took out his
latchkey. They passed into the dimly
lit hall of their boarding-house, and
Anna, after discreet good nights, went
softly upstairs. The two young men
tiptoed their .way into a small room
at the back of the house, called by
.courtesy the smoking-room. Horace,
roused from his slumbers, was bribed
to bring them whisky.
"Yes, it was my sister," Anna an
swered. "I suppose that we are very
much alike.'" .-
"You see," she said, "I am a very
black sheep indeed. My own people
will have nothing to do with me."
"It was your sister, of course?" Syd
ney remarked softly. "What a mar
velous likeness!"/
Both Brendon and Sydney Courtlaw
plunged instantly Into some alien sub
ject of conversation. But Anna's low
laugh, although not altogether mirth
ful, brushed away the moment of em
barrassment.
people were Just emerging after sup
per. A tall commissionaire was stand
ing by the door of a small handsome
brougham. Sir John, with Annabel and
her aunt in close attendance were
crossing the pavement. It chanced
that Annabel turned her head, and for
a moment the eyes of the two sisters
met. Sir John also looked around, and
seeing Anna frowned severely. He
bent down and whispered something in
his companion's ear. She nodded and
suffered herself to be handed into the
carriage.
"I suppose, Mr. Brendon," she said,
looking up at him with an engaging
smile, "that we- shall lose you now."
"Not Just at present, I think," Bren
don answered. "It will take several
months to settle things up, and then I
may have to go to America." Â»
. Mrs. White nodded.
"It will be very nice if you stay with
us till then," she said. "I am sure we
shall all be sorry when you go. How
"But it's a real good thing," the
young man urged. "I wouldn't men
tion it except for your being one of us
here. It's a real bit of all right. I don't
mind telling you. I've money in it my
self; and it's got to go, sure as my
name's Gudden."
Brendon . detached himself good
humoredly. Mrs. White beckoned him
to her side.
She smiled grimly at the recollection
of that lunch â tea and roll at an
aerated bread shop. Sydney was watch
â¢ ing her eagerly.
"I'm glad you're all right," he said,
"because we want you to do us a favor.
Brandon's had an awful stroke of
luck." â¢
"I'm delighted," she exclaimed. "Do
tell me all about it."
"He only heard this afternoon." Syd
ney continued. "An uncle in New
York Is dead and has left him loads
. of money. A lawyer has come all the
way from America about It. We want
to celebrate, and we want you to help
us. Brendon suggests supper at the
Carlton. We meant to make it din
ner and a theater, but you were not
at home." /
Anna shook her head dubiously.
"It is ever bo nice of you to have
waited," she said, "but you know the
arrangement we made. Shares in ev
erything, and â "
"But this Is an exception, surely,"
Sydney protested. "Besides, you in
sisted upon being hostess that first
evening, and this is onjy a return.
Don't disappoint Brenc%h. It's an
awful stroke of luck for him, you
know, especially as he hated the bank
so; but it'll spoil it all for him if you
don't come. He'll be quite hurt, too."
Anna hesitated. She was really very
hungry indeed.
"You are quite sure that this Is not
an excuse of Mr. Brendon's? You boys
have been so kind to me, andâ"
"Positive," Sydney declared. "It's a
dead cert. I've seen the papers, and
Brendon has heaps of money already
to be going on with. You'll come,
won't you? We thought of starting
in half 'an hour's time and try for a
theater somewhere on the way."
Anna nodded.
"Delightful!" she exclaimed. "I'll
come. Run away now, please. I must ,
see if I have a gown fit to wear."
In the drawing-room below a whisper
Â©f Brendon's good fortune had gone
round. Miss Amelia Ellicot held out
both her hands and looked inexpressible
things Into his eyes.
"You know that I am glad," she said
to him, with- a most becoming mixture
of modesty and effusion. "I can't tell
you how glad before all these people."
She dropped her eyes and wandered
off to a remote corner of the room,
whither Brendon did not follow her.
Her mother made whispered comments
to Mrs. White on Milly's sensitiveness,
which were easily overheard by every
one in the room. Mr. Building, aban
doning a position of portly ease upon
the hearthrug, came and patted Bren
don gently on the back.
- "Let me give you a word of advice,
young man," he said solemnly. "You
will, I presume, abandon your present
occupation and enjoy a brief period of
idleness. Presently that idleness will
begin to pall. You will look about for
something to do. Go in for public life.
There is nothing more expanding, more
thoroughly satisfactory, than to serve
one's countryoJn one's leisure hours.
You will never regret it. I speak, as I
dare say you know, from experience.
For fourteen years I represented Sprox
ton uion the Worcestershire County
Council. I have only to show myself
there to-day and I am instantly recog
nized. Every man and boy in the place
touches his hat to me. That sort of
thing is always â erâ most gratifying.
Of course, it is scarcely likely that you
will be able to begin your career with
the City Council; that may come by
and by; but there are minor offices in
which you mayâ may serve your ap
prenticeship in public life. I myself
started by being the overseer of an im
portant parish."
The Semitic young gentleman, who
had been hanging restlessly around
during the ex-County Councilor's ora
tion, laid his finger persuasively on
Brendon's coat sleeve.
"Look here," he whispered. "You're

By some Ellen Glasgow's novel t "The Deliverance/' has been styled the novel par excel- â¢

a book by an American author has to be very good to be read, extended comment lias been made
upon its power in the delineation of elemental impulses of human life. Truly, no book of re

Mary Johnston, the disct pie of the historical romance, has been open to less unanimous
commendation in the writing of "Sir Mortimer." On both sides of the water there have been
sharp flings <it what the critics termed the "stage play" of its romantic incident. According to
the list of /'best sellers," however, "Sir Mortimer" has kept well in the lead of the season's books.

mark the September number of the
Critic; the one dealing with "The Lit

nection with literary persons and places
from the time of his first report of
"The Readings of Charles Dickens,"
published in 1S63 in the Red Hook Jour
nal. .
The best thing in the book is the
sketch of "Old Man Berry." Here the
author gives a breathing picture of one
who had reached his four-score years
but who was still on a feverish hunt
for that lure that had been so many
times Just within the fancied reach of
his hand. This indomitable old pros
pector â crazy, some would call himâ
who is as willing to bend his withered
hands to the taming of a fractious colt
as he is to court death In the desert, is
a type that should live in c piece of fic
tion, so virile is he made in the few
sketch ljnes blocked out by Mrs, Stro
bridge.
For those who have a sense quick
ened to the possibilities of fiction the
recital of the myths concerning the
Hardln silver, "Forman's Find" or the
"Three Little Lakes of Gold" brings
instant response. These tales of lost
treasure, each with Its grisly record cf
death and privation and year-long de
spair, have in them strong possibilities
for more serious treatment, which the
author should embrace. Her manner of
telling is dramatic; the narratives
themselves are intensely fascinating.
Though marred occasionally by a
straining after effect. Mrs. Strobridge's
style Is quite commensurate with the
charm of the subject she has elected to
portray. When she has to reproduce
before us some of the weird beauty of
sculptured hills and purpled skyline she
makes a choice of phrase and meta
phor at times impressive.
Briefly, in subject matter, in diction
and even in artistic handiwork of bind
ing, Idah Meacham Strobridge's collec
tion of sketches Is one of the most en
tertaining books that have been writ

"In Miners' Mirage Land"â that
means to the author the land of vis
ions, the land of wild dreams wherein
men's minds are clouded with the aura
of golden imaginings. Just as the
thirst ridden traveler may vainly pur

miles of shifting wastes so do these
seekers of the glittering promise make
of their lives but tke record of cease

Meachani Strobridge; its name, "In

no way upon Mrs. Austin's province â â¢
desert still life and the creatures of
the sandy wastesâ this last volume o'f
wilderness lore but broadens the field
by Its more detailed, treatment of the
humankind of sagebrush land. The
mystery of the great unwatered reaches
of the West is in each the fundamental
motive. The lady who wrote about
the little town of the grapevine down
en the edge of the Mohave shows us
the men of the desert steeped in the
subtle influence of the barrens until
quiescence wraps them in a mantle of
something almost akin to fatalism;
Idah Meacham Strobridge follows the
mad striving, the restless battling of
desert dwellers, trying ever to wreak
fortune from the veiled genius of their
parched abiding places.
This writer, whose name Is not an
unfamiliar -one to old readers of The
Call, is a true daughter^of Nevada
she has the typical Nevtda love for
the land that seems all too wearisome
from the coaches of the train. To her
the desert is as the Cumaean Sibyl
whose books are only to b"reÂ»d by the
elect- Here is its charm:
Of course, the everlasting talk of
dollars which the painter heard on all
sides of him and in hours seemly
and otherwise Impressed him as
â¢worthy of comment, and. naturally so.
We ourselves are ready to admit that
"dollars" comes to the tip of the
American tongue more handily than
any other word and we are equally
ready to deplore the fact did only such
acknowledgment of our falling bring
anything of betterment with It. Fur
thermore Burne-Jones seems to see a
natural correlation between the craze
of money getting and the treatment of
our women. Says he:
The women seem better able to
cope with the situation (the amassing;
ef great wealth) and find no difficulty
In spending the money their fathers
and husbands have spoiled their
lirtM in acquiring. And, as a rule, the
men are content that this should be
so. There is something very remark
able, something a bit pathetic, about
the attitude of the American men to
their women folk. They are anxious
for them to hare a 'good time'â the
good time that they cannot and will
not arrange for themselves."
At times this genial sightseer lapses
Into the strictly scientific mood of
austere Investigation and treats of our
idiosyncrasies as If he were adding
to & thesis upon anthropoid apes In
Sarawak. Witness this, from a dell
clooslr British standpoint:
"The peanut Is a very favorite
article ef light and occasional food
frr^f the poorer people, the stalls
for its sale presided over by Italians,
etc." And again: "It is commonly
called "Peacock Row/ or 'Rubber

are like spoiled children," is Burne-

"surfeited -with excitement, yet always
hungering for more; there Is some
thing pathetic about the Incessant un
rest of them."
Thus the author-painter's views un
wind themselves â some heavy with
good, sound sense, some laughable In
their childlike ingenuousness. Bitter

to gloss our faults rather than pin

cf those collected opinions of an Eng
lishman upon things American, a
sport of the literary muse fraught
with danger to the author and the
reader since Charles Dickens deliver
ed himself of the biting sarcasm in
"Martin Chuzzlewit." Dickens en
deavored to make amends by his sub
sequent "American Notes," with only
partial success, for we Americans are
thin skinned If nothing else. So, If
we are behindhand let it be consider
ed the part of discretion and of all
fairness.
After all the English painter came
over here, not with any preconceived
prejudices, but with a mind clean as
a elate and ready to receive impres
sions. He did receive many; some flat
tering to ourselves, others distinctly
the contrary. Added to the typical
conservatism of the British mind
were the finical delicacies of the
artistic sense â & double handicap, cer
tainly not to be considered auspicious
for our fair appearance in his eyes.
But even under the astigmatic ten
dencies of these two lenses of birth
and profession. Sir Philip saw very
much as you or I would see were we
suddenly introduced into the rush of
New York and the tinsel of Newport
from a foreign land.
Burne-Jcnes smelt New York be
fore he came to Fire Island â this was
the delicate artistic sense stirring
rithin him. He declares that it was
not an unpleasant odor, but one dis
tinctive enough to be recognized, even
if encountered in the uttermost ends
of the earth. Then, in a little while
he heard New York, dinning up to the
high heavens", and the noise soon be
came an ever-present irritation to him.
Again the artistic, the esthetic. But
the pure British of him asserts itself
in the author's evident surprise at the
uniform cleanliness of New York's
denizens. Everybody seemed to be
"well tubbed," neatly clothed â and
the tubs themselves! First of the three
things which Burne-Jones knows he
will miss in England is his "beautiful
snow-white tub, with its silver fit
tings and perennial supply of hot
water and cold."
VIEWS ABOUT
â¢ AMERICA,
Harry Leon Wilson, whose new novel,
"The Seeker," is published by Double
day, Page & Co., has had a varied
career sftce his boyhood on an Illinois
farm. He was a printer, a newspaper
reporter in California with an ambition
to write a history, and a western rail
road man when he was beginning to be
recognized as a literary writer. He be
came associate editor and later # ?ditor
of Puck. His first novel, "The Spend
ers," was an immediate success and
gave promise of an even greater
achievement. "The Seeker" deals In
a most fcrceful way with some ex
ceedingly vital problems of modern life
and thought. Now Mr. Wilson has a
summer home in New Hampshire and
a winter home in the Ozark Mountains
of Missouri, forty miles from a railroad.
"Crecy," by Edith Lawrence, Is a
pretty little tale of the Revolution,
rather stereotyped, to be sure, bi^t
capable of providing a good two hours'
pleasure. The author, realizing no
doubt that the story of the winsome
colonial lassie and her British lover has
been told many times,- seeks to furbish
up the old type stock by a change in
the manner of the telling. In the form
of a series of letters between the vari
ous characters of her story Miss Law
rence finds conveyance for the romance
a bit cumbersome at times and prolific
of a certain lack of continuity.
Crecy, whose bona fide portrait from
the brush of Stuart graces the frontal
page, is as wild a blade as one would
meet in a month of Sundays. The first
of her letters shows her berating her
Quaker cousin and affianced husband,
Nathaniel Darrach, for his policy of
non-resistance, pursued steadfastly in
the face of the invasion of the British.
Th'en we find her confiding in Cousin
Peace Darrach the details of a little
affair of the heart with a young red
coat cornet of the English forces who
presses his suit with far more stead
fastness than the cause of his coun
try.
With all of the characters introduced
thus through their own written words
the tale proceeds to unravel its length
through mingled cloud and sunshine of
war and frolicking. Crecy gets into
the net pretty deeply with her young
Britisher, her Quaker cousin turns
fighter and her own brother has the
bad grace to turn traitor and spy. At
the midnight revel of the Hessians at
Trenton Crecy's father, resolute Friend
though he is, acts as the one to signal
when the Continentals should fall to
the slaughter. Then enters Washing
ton upon the scene and remains to the
fore throughout the rest of the story
a3 arbiter both of life and love. At
the end Crecy's rampant patriotism eo
far adjusts itself as to admit of. her
marrying her British lover and pre
sumably "living happy ever after."
Like nearly all of the colonial stories
this book attempts a near view of
Washington.'with results not altogeth
er satisfying. It is hard to believe that
with the manifold worriments of an
adverse campaign vexing him without
cease the great general could devote
hours of his time to the settlement of
the love affairs of a girl, even of a
Crecy.

WRITERS AND THEIR
WORKCAMPAIGNS
AND
CAMPAIGNING
There is something exhilarating about
a campaign. Whether the object be to
elect a President or conquer a nation,
or endow a university or win a wife.
Its prosecution arrests attention, and
makes the 1 blood tingle. We admire the
picturesque features, forecast the out
come, and let. our sympathies go out to
the party whom we consider best en
titled to win. â¢ No summer can be utter
ly dull when a vigorous campaign ia
proceeding; no one can be wholly j inert
and -impassive when somewhere in the
world there is the. shock of contending
arms, the bugle summons to heroic en
deavor, the stern pursuit of some great
goal. ... :
But there. are certain, moral consid
erations involved . In campaigns.': One
may be summed , up in, this injunction:
Be fair to your opponent. Party pre
judices do not,' as a rule, foster a strict
sense Â¦ of justice. : It .. is so much * easier
to misunderstand ' and misrepresent
your opponent than ' to state his posi
tion . clearly and honestly; so . much
easier to asperse the motives of the
other fellows than ; to Â¦ admit Â¦ that â¢ many
of them . may be . as .honest and patri
otic ' as ourselves. bred In
the bone, in particular, find it hard to
conceive of an action 'as [ever being
done without regard to Its political ef
fect. But: surely: it Is conceivable that
a man running for office may write a
letter, or/ send a telegram, at the dic
tates of , simple duty; and honor,' and
not because he â¢ hopVs ' to subserve '. his
personal' interests by it. How little,
after, all, the conventional .politician
understands the " inbred .' instinct . of
Americans i for . fair play, and Â¦Â¦ straight
dealing! Â¦ But whenever a man 'in 'pub
lic life, like Â¦Â¦ Mr. / Jerome or 'â¢ Mr. : Folk
moves i forward - on . the â¢ sheer merits of
his cause and regardless of . the' reflex
influence i on himself , he stands to' lose
rather than gain Â¦ in * the ' public â¢ esti
mate. ..â¢.-â¢ â¢ :
Another,, rule for campaigners is to
keep the Â¦ main . issue in... sight. The
temptation is, to spend time and effort
over minor concerns, rather than go
straight to the heart of the matter. Tha
manly way Is to . set forth In bold,
strong colors the object of your cam
paign, to define sharply the difference
between you and your competitor, if
there is any difference on vital points,
and to adhere tenaciously to that cen
tral objectl ' Before a man can get my
vote for his candidate, I want him to'
tell me in clear,' terse language, why he,
of all men on the earth at this time,
ought to have It. General Grant used
to say: "I do not care to know so
much where . the x eriemy Is going to
strike;, what I want to know is where
I am going to strike." â¢
It- is .well jalso to remember that
campaigns .are , won by substantial
methods. Transparencies and pro
cessions, opening guns and . closing
rallies, banners and buttons, the" flood
off oratory and various devices known
to managers for enlisting popular in
terest are all well enough so far as they
go, .but ; . redoubts . at .' Gettysburg
were won at the point of the bayonet
and ; in- no other way. The .American
people is more and. more disposed to
take its politics seriously,, to respond
sooner Ao :, logical ; argument , and sane
appeal, ; rather than , to . the flimsy ex
pedients for manufacturing party cap
ital.;
Finally, we ought all to learn to
keep cool during campaigns. What
ever- the : outcome ' we ' shall have to go
on= living after they/ are over* and
whether \ the ; result accords with our
desires and; efforts, we may well, be

"No English contemporary profession
has left us work so full of living
fire." ' Â¦ -
For once, and in this particular In
stance, Accursed Eve in literature has,
in such a verdict, won her^ merited
honors. ":Â¦"'.
But as a . rule honors are withheld
from her and the laurel Is. filched from
her brows by Coward Adam ere she
has time to wear it. One flagrant
case is well known, of a man who,
having lived entirely on a woman's
literary earnings for years, went about
in the clothes . her Â¦ pen had paid for,
among the persons to whom, through
her Influence, he had been introduced,
boasting that he assisted her to write
the- greater part of her books. To
their shame, be it said, a great many
people believed him, and not until he
was dead, and the woman went on
writing her books as before, did they
here be chronicled. Of how many books,
bearing a woman's name on the title
page is it said, "Her husband helped
her," or "She got Mr. So-and-So to
write the descriptive part!" George
Eliot has often been accused of being
assisted in her novels by Mr. Lewes
A little incidentâ touching enough to
my mindâ is related in the memoirs of
Charlotte Bronte. After her marriage
and when she ,\vas expecting the birth
of a child, she was reading some of
the first chapters of an Intended new
novel to her husband, who. as he lis
tened, said in that peculiarly encour
aging way common to men who have
gifted women to deal with, "You seem
to be repeating- yourself. , You must
take care not to repeat yourself." Poor
little soul! She never "repeated" her
selfâshe just died. No one can tell
how her husband's thoughtless phrase
may have teased or perplexed her sen
sitive mind, in a critical condition of
health, and helped to hasten the fatal
end. Edward FitzGerald's celebrity as
a scholar Is not, and never will be wide
enough to blot out from remembrance
his brutal phrase - on â¢ hearing of the
death of Elizabeth Barrett Browningâ
"Mrs. Browning is dead. Thank God
we shall have no more Aurora Lelghs."
While, far more creditable to Alger
non Charles Swinburne than his phrase
of himself now unfortunately affixed
to -the newly collected edition of his
works, Is the praise he bestows on this'
noble woman-genius in his preface to
her great' poem. I quote 'one line of it
hereâ . .'. v
ones with the most engaging frank
ness. The "subtil" ones naturally take
every, advantage of her and some of
them put a stopgap on her efforts if
they can. A good - many people in
London know privately the sto'ry of a
certain ; beautiful woman in society
who composed an admirable opera
and played the melodies of it over to
a . third-rate musician, who professed
to be her lover. The third-rate rascal
stole all her music and produced the
opera as his own. She had no remedy,
as to br|ng the matter before the law
would have necessitated making pub
lic the intimacy between her and the
robber of her ideas. So she held her
peace; and of her broken heart and
ruined hopes the world at large Is
ignorant. But no wonder that like
the hero of Swinburne's "Triumph of
Time" she says she "will hate sweet
music her whole life long."
How many times men have tried to
steal away the honor of a woman's
name and fame in literature. need not
Accursed Eve! Still she lovesâ to
find herself fooled and cheated: still
she hopes, even while hope eludes her
still she waits, for what she may never
winâ still she prays prayers that may
never.be- answered â still she rears the
men Â« of the future, wondering per
chance whether any of them will ever
help to do her Justiceâ will ever place
her where - she should be as the ac
knowledged queenly "helpmeet" of her
stronger but less enduring partner!
Beautiful, frail, trusting, loving Ac
cxirs'ed Eve! She bends beneath the
curse â but the clouds are liftingâ there
Is light in the sky of her future dawn!
And it may be that a worse malediction
than the onÂ© pronounced in Eden will
fall. on those who make her burden of
life heavier to bear!
If their instinctive efforts have been
met with cruelty, oppression, neglect,
desertion and sometimes the most
heartless and cowardly betrayal, they
can scarcely bÂ« blamed if they play
the same tricks on the unloving, dis
loyal churls for whom they have per
haps sacrificed the best part of their
lives. For innocent faith and trusting
love are the best part of every woman's
life; and when these are destroyed by
the brutalizing touch of. some Coward
Adam the woman may well claim com
pensation for her soul's murder.
even besln to see tne wrong tney had
done her. They would not have dared
to calumniate the false boaster as they
calumniated the innocent hard work
er. . Tke boaster was a man â the
worker a womanâ therefore the dis
honor of passing off literary work not
one's own must naturally belong to
Accursed Eve, so they thoughtâ not to
Coward Adam! Of their humiliation
when all the truth was known, history
sayeth nothing.
Yet, with all the weight of her curse
more or less upon her, and with all
her sorrows, shattered ideals, wrecked
hopes and lost loves. Accursed Eve is
still the most beautiful, the most per
fect figure In all creation. Her fail
ings, her vanities, her weaknesses, her
sins, arise in the first place from love
â even if afterward, through Coward
Adam's ready encouragement, they de
generate into vice and animalism. Her
first impulse in earliest youth la a
desire to please Adam â the same im
pulse precisely which led her to offer
him the forbidden apple in the first
days of their mutual acquaintance.
She wishes to charm him â to win his
heart â to endear herself to him In a
thousand tender ways â to wind her
self irretrievably round his life. If
she succeeds in this aim 'she Is Invari
ably happy and virtuous. But if she
Is made to feel that she cannot hold
him on whom her thoughts are cen
tered â if his professed love for her
only proves weak and falsÂ« when put
to trial â if he finds It easy to forget
both sentiment and courtesy, aad is
quick to add Insult to injury, then all
the finer and more delicate emotions
of her nature become warped and un
strung â and though she endured her
Bufferings because she must, he re
sents it and takes vengeance when she
can. Of resentfulness against wrong
and revenge for Injustice come' what
are called "bad women." Yet I would
humbly venture to maintain that even
these "bad" were not bad In* the first

al way, with the usual Eve impulse â

but the opposite Sex.

â¢Accursed Eve! .Mother of the
World! What high thing does she
seek?- Mother of Christianity itself,
she stands before u?,' si figure symbolic
of all good, her Holy Child in her
arms, her sweet, musing, prayerful
face bending over it in gravely lender
devotion. From her- soft breast
humanity springs renewed â she rep
resents the youth, the hope and love
of all mankind. Wronged .is she has
been, and as she often still is, her
patience never fails. Deceived, she
"mends her broken shell with pearl"
and still trusts on. Her sweet credu
lousness is the same as it ever was â â¢
the "subtil" one can always overreach
her through her too ready confidence
iu the. Idea that "all things work to
gether for good." Her "curse" is the
crime of loving ' too well- â believing
too much. Should a "subtil" one say
he loves her, she honestly thinks he
dees. When, he turns out, as often
happens in some cases, toebe looking
after her money rather than herself,
she can scarcely force her mind to
realize that he is not so much a hero
as a cad. ' When she has to earn- her
own living in any of the artistic pro
fessions she will frequently tell all her
plans, hopes and ambitions to "subtil"
that in those early periods of civiliza
tion, when literature and art were just
dawning upon the world, man, though
aggregating to his own ego nearly
everything in the universe, paused be
fore representing himself as a figure or
justice, mercy or wisdom. He evident
ly realized his unfitness to stand, even
in marble, before the world as a sym
bol of moral virtue. He therefore, with
a grace which well became him in
those "pagan" days, bent the knee to
all noble attributes of humanity as rep
resented in woman. Her fair face, her
beauteous figure, greeted him in all his
sacred temples of worshipâ as Venus
and Diana &ht smiled upon himâ as the
goddess of Fortune or Chance, she ac
cepted his votive wreathsâ as Fame or
Victory she gave him blessing when
ever he went to war or returned in tri
umph from the fieldâ and all this was
the erabrvo or shadowing-forth of wo
man's higher future and better possi
bilities, when the days of her long and
cruel probation should be accomplished
and her "curse" in part be lifted. There
are signs and tokens that this happy
end is in sight. Accursed Eve is be
ginning to have a good time. And the
only fear now is lest she should over
strp the mark of her well-deserving
liberty and run headlong into, license.
For Eve, with or without cause, is nat
urally impulsive and credulous, and be
ing too often forgetful of the little in
cident which occurred to her in the
matter of the tree of good and evil, is
still far too prone to listen to the be
guiling of "subtil" personages worse
"than any beast of the field which. the
Lord hath made."
Accursed Eve, having broken several
of her old-time fetters and beginning to
feel her feet as well as her wings, just
now wants a word in politics. As one
of her cursed daughters, I confess I
wonder that she should wish to put
herself to so much unnecessary trouble,
seeing that she has the whole game- in
her- hands. Politics are generally
hustled along by Coward Adamâ unless
by rarest chance Brave Adam, his twin
brother, suddenly steps forth unexpect
edly, when there ensues what is called
a "collapse of the government." In any
question, small or great. Accursed Eve
has only to offer Coward Adam the ap
ple and he will eat It. Which metaphor
implies that even in politics, If she only
moves him round gradually to her own
views In that essentially womanly , way
which," while â¢ persuading,' seems not to
persuade, he is bound to yield. Person
ally.speaking, I do not know any man
who Is not absolutely under the thumb
of at least one woman. . And I will not
believe that there Is any woman so fee
ble, so stupid, so lost to the power and
. charm of her own individuality, as not
to-be able "to Influence quite half -a
, dozen men. This being the case, what
does Accursed Eve want with a vote?
If she is so unhappy, so ugly, so repul
sive, so deformed in mind , and man
ners as to have no influence at all on
any creature of the male sex whatever,
neither father, nor brother, nor uncle,
nor cousin, nor lover, nor. husband, nor
friend â would the* opinion of such a one
be 1 of any consequence or her .vote of
any .value? I assert nothingâ I only ask
the question. , .. , r
Speaking personally as a woman, Â¦ I
have no politics and want none. I only

Uoin ihea till now. "I will greatly

and liaiiy-mut; client upon her un
fortunate Usjul that in the Jewish
â¢ liuul to t ".i:s very day there 13 a part
ol the ierWv-c '..herein the men, stand
ing in the -Ji ssence of women, indi
vidually r~iy: "I thank theÂ», O God, for
not havinji n:.Je me a woman!" thus
deliberately insulting, in thsir very
house of worship, the sex of their
inuthers!
But from the earliest times, if we
are to accept historical- testimony, the
Jo^s of the ancient world appear to
iia.\o treated women in the majority as
"Sornrthin*; wcrser than their dug. a.
little lower than their horse." Save and
except those rare cases where the Jew
ish woman suddenly found out her
latent powers and employed them to
ad%'ar.tagre, the Jewish man made her
ietch and carry for him like a veritable
b.'ast of burden. He yoked her to his
plow with oxen â he â¢ sold and ex
changed her with his friends as freely
as any other article of commerce â his
"base uses" of her were various, and
seldom to his credit â while, such as
they were, they only lasted so long as
they satisfied his immediate humor.
When done with she was "cast out."
The kind of "casting out" to which she
was subjected Is not always explained.
But It may be taken for granted that
In many Instances she was either killed
outright, or turned adrift to die of star
vation and weariness. The Jews in
their Biblical days were evidently not
much affected by her griefs. They'
were God's "chosen" peopleâ and " that
women were the mothers of the whole
â¢'chosen" race appeared to call for' no
claim on their chivalrous-tenderness or:
consideration.
Looking back through the vista, of
time to that fabled Eden, when she
listened to the tempting of the "sub
til" one, the wrong* and injustices en
dured by Accursed Eve . at the hand
of Coward Adam make up a calendar
of appalling, almost superhuman crime.
Man has taken the full license allowed
him by the old Genesis story,, which, by
the way, was of course' Invented by
man himself for his own convenience.
"Thy desire shall be to thy husband
and he shall rule over thee." And
'among all tribes, and in all nations he
has ruled, with a rod of Iron! The
Christian dispensation interfered some
what with his former, reign of tyranny,
for with the bjrth of Christ came, to a
certain extent,' the idealization and'
beatification of womanhood. The
Greeks -and Romans, however, had a
latent glimmering idea of what -.woman

she might possibly attain to In the fu

"lately returned from college." That tells me that he is a first

about- his brain* power, I confess. -The 'description of him as a
"typical young Englishman" suggests more information in this
particular point. One assumes that the American girl, with the
"elusive expression," is going to have sufficient for both. "They
are ; a delightful family." The suti-editor docs not say so, but I
imagine the two sisters arc likewise typical young English
women. They ride and shoot, and cook and make! their own
dresses. The third, chapter is "taken " up with the humors of a
local cricket match." Thank you, Mr. Sub-Editor, I feel I owe
you gratitude. In. the fourth Ursula Bart (I was beginning to
get anxious about her) turns up again. She is staying at the
useful Lady, Mary's place in Yorkshire. She meets' Basil' by
accident one morning while riding alone. That is the advantage
of having^ an American girl for your heroine. Like the British
army: it 'goes anywhere and does anything. In ; chapter five
Basil and Ursula meet again, this time at 1 a picnic. The sub
editor Jlocs "not wish to repeat himself, otherwise he probably
would have summed up chapter, five by saying it was "Taken
up ; with, the .humors of; the. usual vpicnic"; In chapter, six some
thing happens : "Basil," retunning late one day, comes across Ur
sula Bart in a lonely part of* the moor, talking "earnestly to a
rough-looking stranger. His approach across the soft turf being
unnoticed, he cannot help overhearing Ursula's parting words: "I
must see you again. : To-morrow night at. half-past nine. In the
gateway of the ruined abbey." Who is he? And why must Ur
sula see him again at such an hour? In such a spot?
THE SAN FRANCISCO SUNDAY CALL.
ON a newspaper placard, the other day, 1 saw announced
a new novel t>y a celebrated author. I bought a copy of
the paper and turned eagerly to the last page. I was
disappointed to find that I had missed the first six
chapters. The story had commenced the previous Saturday ; this
was Friday. I say I was disappointed, and so I was at first; but
my disappointment did not last long. ' The bright and intelligent
sub-editor according to the custom now in vogue, had provided
me with a short synopsis of those first six chapters, so that with
out the trouble of reading them I knew what they were all about.
"The first installment," I learned, "introduces . the reader to a
brilliant and distinguished company assembled' in the drawing
room of Lady Mary's maisonette in Park street, and much smart
talk, was indulged in." I know that "smart talk" so well. ..Had I
not been lucky in missing that first chapter I should have had to
listen to it once again. Possibly -enough of it might have been
new to me, but it would have read, I feel, so very like the old.
A .dear, sweet, white-haired lady of my acquaintance.;- is never
surprised at anything that happens. "Something very 1 much of
the 'same kind occurred," she will, remember, "one winter when
we were living in Dresden. Only on that occasion the man's
name, I think,' was Robinson." We do not like new storiesâ nor
write them, either. "Much smart talk is indulged in." There is
absolutely no need to ask for. more than that. There is a Duchess
who says improper things. Once she used to shock me, but now
I am too familiar with her. -She is really: a very nice woman;
she doesn't mean them; and when the heroine " is in trouble,
toward the. middle of the book, she is just, as amusing on the
side. of virtue. There Js, besides, a younger lady, whose specialty
is proverbs. Apparently, whenever she hears a proverb she writes
it down, with the idea of seeing into how -many different forms it
can be made to go. It looks clever/ As i a matter of \ fact, it is
extremely easy. "Be virtuous and you. will be happy."; She jots
down all the possible variations. -..-"Be virtuous and you will be
unhappy." "Too simple, that 'one/'she tells, herself. "Be
and your friends will be happy, if you 'are* not." Better,; but not
wicked enough. Let's try again: "Be happy, and people "will jump

it Is well to gently revolve round and

Another exercise that doubtless all
have tried at some time or . other is
No. 4. The arms are raised from the
sides and extended to their full length
until the hands meet above the head,
palms to the front, fingers pointed up

front, and the shoulders pressed back.
Then comes the test, and a test it 1b,
too. Bend over until . the finger tips
touch the ground and remember to
keep the arms straight and the knees
rigid as well. Straighten the body and
swing the arms, extended, to the verti
cal position. At first this will doubt
less be absolutely impossible, but it
can be mastered in a short time, and
I assure you It is .well worth -the while.
6. Raise the arms to the front until
the arms-are In front of and at the
height of the shoulders. The palms
are down, fingers extended and joined
and the thumbs under - the forefingers.
Bend the trunk forward at the hips as
far as possible and swing the Â¦ arms
backward, knees and arms straight.
Then straighten the trunk and swing
the arms to the forward position to the

Â¦6. Place the hands on the hips. Then
lower the body and slowly separate the

Almost the first thing to do is to
learn certain exercises for certain
things and then to devote, say ten
minutes a dav to them, and this ten
minutes, by the way, may be at odd In
tervals if one likes, for if the exercises
are taken whenever one has time the
result is the same. Last Sunday I gave
a series of simple arm and shoulder
exercises and this week I want special
ly to dwell upon trunk exercises, for
they seem to me all Important.
Walking, as you must have guessed,

one's boudoir. This is 1 swimming.
Every muscle of the body Is in ac
tive working order and the sleep that
one should get immediate 1 - after is
the purest and best that one can have

So much for outdoor exercise. Of
course any indoor training is. more
irksome, but it is frequently quite as

not be left out.
Figures 1 and 2 are a splendid pair
for actual benefit. Raise the hands
and place them on the hips, fingers
to the rear, thumbs to the front and
the elbows pressed well back. Bend
the trunk forward at the hips and then
slowly raise and bend the trunk to the
rear as far as is possible. Execute
both motions slowly and without bend
ing the knees, else half the good will
be lost.
Another excellent exercise is No. 3.
The hands are thrust down full length
to begin with and the trunk is bent
to the right ap- 1 left without twisting
It or raising either heel. As you can
easily see it is practically the same
as the one above it. but the results
are vastly different and It is well
worth while to do both of them faith
fully.

[A glimpse" of the past -and into the
future of the viticultural industry of
the United States. Read at a meeting
of the Californlu Viticultural Club at
San Francisco.] , Â¦ ,
PREVIOUS to the introduction of
the Catawba Into general culti
vation, the 'more important at-,
tempts at grape growing in the
vStatis.^east of. the Rocky Mountains
had with \ Vinifera varieties and
were not. a commercial success. The
Introduction of this grape really
marked a new era in viticultural his
tory, for with it began the improving
ofour native grapes and the racing
of varieties; from them for commercial
purposes. It gave such an Impetus to
grape culture, that - ten years later
nearly 100 varieties were enumerated ;
forty years later all the States and
Territories, except four, were growing
grapes, and now there are over 100,000
well described varieties of American
grapas.
While -this ( was v occurring in thÂ«
States east of -the Rockies, the pioneer
grape growers of California, who had.
previously' been growing the Mission
variety, turned their attention to the
introduction bfj choice European vari
eties, and .grape growing in California
as an industry began to assert itself.
How rapid for a time the progress was
are matters of comparatively recent
history.
The viticultural" - industry in this
country as such is, therefore, little over
half a century old and is as yet In it3
infancy. It has led up'to the manufac
ture of choice -wines- from American
grapes. The manufacture of sparkling
wine and unfermented grape juice has
bVen developed in' the Eastern States,
while the Pacific Coast has entered into
direct competition '/with/ the choicest
European "wines and has captured the
raisin , market . of this, country. The
industry inv this country has already
up to date divided itself into two en
tirely distinct districts. In California,
where the Vinif eras have ever found
a congenial home, these are being ex
clusively grown, and east of the
Rocky , Mountains, where previous at
tempts eeemed to indicate that Vini
feras\were a failure, the culture and
improvement of American varieties has
been as tenaciously followed. Whaka
wonderful effect surroundings have,
and -what "diversity of tastes they de
.velqp into individuals! For instance,
in Oregon, where ..quite a number of
â¢people have settled from States east
of the Rock)Â«s, the fresh grapes and
unfermented juices sold are principally
from' the States whence these people
came. In making my. rounds of
the experimental vineyards conducted
by the Government , on, the Atlantic
Coast, where the culture of Vinif eras
on resistant stock has been made an
important study, I have often invited
people to try the fruit and express their
opinion regarding the .Vinifera vari
eties grown there, arid the answer
usually is: "They are nice, but not as
good as Concord, Niagara or Dela
ware."
' Considering the youth of our indus
try, the results so far achieved are
remarkable, and we have reason to
feel proud of them. Nevertheless, we
have only made a beginning and much
remains to be done! x 4 :
v ' > Major John' Adlum, writing to Nicho
las Longworth of Cincinnati about the
Catawba, says. "In introducing this
grape into general cultivation I have
done the country ; a greater good than
if I had paid the national i debt." No
doubt he had become convinced that
for â¢ the territory he and j Longworth
were ", familiar with . and in which they
had been trying to grow grapes the
improving of the native species was
the road to â¢ success, when really it
means far more than this, for the.Im
i proving of our; native species rls the
problem ; -which, when, .solved. : will
make it possible to grow * grapes In
"practically, all parts of the IJnion. No'
. doubt he never .'thought that \ resistant
stock (or American varieties) would in
the near future be the- agency through
which the leading grape, districts of
the world could re-establish their vine
yards. Â¦ Neither was he aware of the
immense possibility for the future there
is In* the improving of another native
American species. I refer to the Scup
pernong, which, is another case of the
survival of the fittestâ a native graDe
abounding on the Atlantic Coast, from
Maryland to Florida, and along the
Gulf to Texas, which resists the phyll
oxera, is the most Immune from dis
eases of any grape species; produces
enormously,! needs perhaps^ less care
and attention than any other, and
thrives on soils almost worthless for
other purposes. It resists and adapts
Itself to climatic - conditions, which
make the- cost of producing other
grapes so costly. Nice Sauternes and
sparkling wine* have been produced
from them, and yet, strange to say.
little or nothing has been done so far
to develop and improve this species.
In it there certainly appear to be great
possibilities for the South Atlantic and
Gulf States.
According to the census of 1900.
169,055 gallons of sparkling wine were
produced In the United States. Of this
Missouri reported 2S40, California 8SS0.
Ohio 15,600 and New York 113.435. Thus
New York produced more than twice
os much as all the rest of the country
and more than twelve times as much as
California. The same year the Chau
tauqua belt alone, on Lake Erie,
shipped 8000 cars of table grapes and
made one and a half millions gallons
of dry wine and ;unfermented srrape
juice. This entire output is from Amer
ican varieties.
The, importance of American or re
sistant varieties to California viticul
ture .needs no mention from me, for
upon this so largely depends the fact
of whether or not the real wine dis
tricts of California will or will not ex
ist in the future. Realizing the gravity
of the situation in California and that
similar, conditions were liable to arise
at any time in any of the States and
Territories of the Union where Euro
pean grapes are a commercial possibil
ity, the Department of Agriculture has
located in California nine experimental
vineyards for the ' purpose of making
such investigations as are deemed nec
essary. These have been located with
special reference to a diversity of soil
and climatic, hillside, valley or destrt
conditions, nearness to and distance
from the ocean, bay and other bodies of
water, and so as to take in the raisin
and table grape as well as wine and
brandy producing districts. At these
experimental vineyards, to begin with,
four cardinal questions are to be inves
tigated:
Firstâ Make a comprehensive test of
the resistant varieties of vines, to de
termined their adaptability to the dif
ferent vineyard soils and climatic con
ditions.
Secondâ To study and determine the
congeniality of Vinifera varieties to the
different resistant varieties. I
Third â To ascertain wbich varieties
are best adapted to the different local
ities.
Fourthâ To afford opportunity for
testing all classes of grapes, with refer
ence to their resistance to diseases
which have been doing such serious in
jury to the vineyards, and, if found
necessary, to undertake the creation of
an entirely new class of grapes to re
sist them.
The first plantings made by the De
partment of Agriculture in the experi
mental vineyards located in California
are expected to make sufficient growth
this season so that systematic grafting
experiments will begin the coming
spring to study the congeniality as
well as the relative value of the leading
commercial varieties of grapes grown
on the coast for different purposes,
grafted on various resistant stocks.
Some observations will be made on the
relative growth and merits of resistant
varieties on different' soils under dif
ferent climatic and other conditions. The
relative rooting qualities of sixty-three
resistant varieties are being tried, with
reference to "their commercial value for
stock purposes. The plantings made to
date at the experimental vineyards are
aa follows:
Oakvilleâ About 10 acres; 179 resist
ant varieties and 57 Vinifera varieties
on resistant stock. Cucamcnga â About
8.4 acres; 400 varieties, nearly all Vlnl
feras. Fresnoâ About 6 acres; 155 re
sistant varieties. Concordâ About IV*
i
acres; 84 resistant varieties. Geyser
ville â About 7% acres; .73 resistant va
rieties. Lodlâ About 1& acres; 63 re
sistant varieties. Uvermore â About 1
acre; 72 resistant varieties. Mountain
View â About 11-7 acres; 79 resistant
varieties. Sonoma â About 1.1 acres; 72
resistant varieties. These plantings
will be enlarged upon as rapidly as
thought necessary.
In prosecuting these investigations
the Bureau of Plant. Industry of the
Department of Agriculture has estab
lished, and Is . maintaining the abova
mentioned' vineyards; ;The f " acricul
turar experiment station of the Uni
versity of California has agreed to co
operate in the work by making sucn
analyses of soils, vines and products
as shall, upon mutual agreement be
tween the bureau and the station, be
fcund desirable or necessary.
While carrying out these Investiga
tions it is our desire to get In as close
touch as possible with all those In
terested and make the Investigations
have a direct and decided Influence
toward improvement in various ways
in the re-establishment of the vine
yards that have been destroyed
through various causes, as well as la
the new acreage planted, earnest con
sideration should be given In planting,
not only to the selection of varieties
for special purposes, but also to soils
and districts producing the best qual
ity and results for that purpose. Every
individual should determine. befora
planting, whether It is desirable to
grow table, raisin, wine or- brandy
grapes, and locate and act according
ly. Quite a number of localities have
already given proof of raisins superior
quality along particular lines; thus,
Livermore has produced choice 3au
ternes. In the Napa and Sonoma dis
tricts there are localities where spe
cially fine white wines and others
where most excellent red wines are
produced, whereas, in the Fresno dis
trict, raisins are a special success,
while in the American River district
choice' table grapes are grown. .~..-
There cannot be too much con
sideration given to quality. In this re
spect California has not been improv
ing along wine lines, but rather retro
grading. Very nearly the same prices
are being paid for Indifferent as for
the choicest grapes, so there Is no In
ducement to produce quality and raai
choice wines are becoming more of a
rarity every year. Those who do not
look into these things closely wonder
why the consumption does not'.la
crease more rapidly, and the compe
tition with New York wines and those
of other States is becoming keener
every year. . :
Glancing over last year's croi>_ re
ports, we find that California 7 pro
duced more than three-fourtha of the
viticultural products of the coun
try, producing in fiscal year of 1902
03 5,700,343 gallons of brandy (by
far the largest output In the history
of the State), and in 1903 30.000.000
gallons of wine. 300 cars of. dried
grapes. 103,000,000 pounds of rai
sins, and shipped 1718 carloads of
green grapes. California's -green
grape shipments, the smallest - com
mercial output of the vine, last year
amounted to about 35,000.000 pounds,
which, compared to other fruit ship
ments, represents almost one-fourth
of the entire shipments of deciduous
green fruit from the State. Wtre we
to compute the amount of green
grapes necessary to produce Califor
nia's output of last year we would
have a irrand total of from S00 000 -
000 to 1,000,000,000 pounds. .
When we consider that the industry
is in its infancy and that at least 75 -
000 acres, of flourishing vineyards
have been destroyed by phylloxera
diseases and other agencies a gr*-u
deal ha3 been accomplished. How
ever, when we think California has a
wine producing area almost equal to
the whole of France and has never
produced more than a little over 43 -
000.000 gallons of wine, whereas
France produces over one and -a half
billion gallons annually, or about
thirty-seven and a : half times as
much, we conclude there Is plenty : of
room to grow In, and we know that
by going at it right .California can
produce products that will compare
with the beat Eurooean productions
and while European countries must
be satisfied with Trom 175 to EtO gal
lons to the acre. California produces
1000 gallons.

The popular idea that your entire

and exhaustion oand pain are to be
avoided as a deadly pest. Perhaps It
might be just as well for me to add
that great care should be taken to see
that the room in which you exercise Is
well ventilated and that your clothing

minor things adds Its weight, and
either very materially assist* or Just

KEEPING one's health Is really
the .'secret of retaining one's
beauty. It is impossible to pos
. sets me without the other.
The ccrrect time to think of health
and how to keep It is during childhood,
for physical training that is begun
during the early years of childhood is
nev?r entirely forgotten and its benefits
are very lasting. Most children need
very little exercise, but they all need
specific and continual instructions in
breathing. Every child dislikes going
to bed, and most of them thoroughly
dislike getting up. and It is the easiest
and simplest thing imaginable to Im
press upon them the importance of
taking long, deep breaths. At first they
consider it fun and are willing to try
anything that will rut off their bed
hour a few minutes, but gradually this
Belfsame fun becomes a fixed habit and
their general health is vastly improved
on account of it.
One of the best exercises for children
Is tumbling about here and there in
their play. It brings all their muscles
into action, produces a general glow-
In their bodies and wearies them evenly.
Another splendid exercise and one
that children take to like a duck to
water is running. For Instance, few
young ladies can run without losing
their breath, gasping spasmodically
and holding: on to their sides as though
they thought their hearts would jump
out of their bodies. If they had been
trained to run slowly and with erect
carriage, and to do it systematically,
they could cover a mile at a good pace
and not be troubled to any extent
either. Of course, I do not mean any
young woman could start out and win
a foot race without training, but a
child that Is taught to run as far as
she can with cemfort every day soon
increases not only her speed but h?r
endurance, and it is surprising the dis
tance she can cover without being se-.
riously disturbed.
But to run well one must run just so.
The girl who touches her heels to the
ground and who fails to spring lightly
from her toes and sole can never make
a huge success at it. Besides this, she
should keep her arms practically mo
tionless and her chest as> high as she
can get It. tnd then take gocd care to
keep it there.
And what happens to this girl? Her
most important muscle, her heart, is
trained to strong, steady exercise and
It gains strength and endurance. To
make a leng story short, this education
brings her many good and serviceable
thingsâ sunny, radiant health and a
magnetism that none but the really
healthy may possess or even know.
Bright, sparkling eyes, .a fresh com
plexion and a clear brain are eagerly
sought after by every" woman under the
Bhlnlng eun, but for some strange rea
son or other nine out of ten deem It
too much trcuMe and too much exer
tion to put into practice such an ex
ceedingly Bbnste exercise as this.
And, by the way, one thing more
will brisk, correct walking accomplish,
and I should think if women do not
care enough about their health they
would possess enough vanity to learn
this trick. No woman who stoops can
have any style about her. The smart
est, most swagger French gown droops
like a bargain counter dress when it
is hung from rounded shoulders and
. every line of the entire body looks de
jected and blue and quite ready to be
laid away on the top sJaelf for repairs.
A woman will orten work like a fiend
to make herself fair to look upon, when
the wouldn't think two pins about her
general health. Of course, this is sup
posing ehe Is fairly well. To at
tain this end she works incessantly to
fill out her neck and shoulders so she
may wear an evening frock and look
well In It. She struggles with her hips
because one is a trifle larger than the
ct^er and does not look well In a tail
ored gown, and she even goes through
nil sorts of running and jumping exer
cises In order that she may be a fetch-
Ing maid In a bathing suit. And when
fche gets herself In good condition what
does she do? Goes to balls, suppers
and the theaters, night after night. She
eats everything from terrapin to can
dies and Ices and with It drinks cham
pagne as a running accompaniment
and then expects to get up late the
next morning and be as fresh looking,
and feel as well as when she was liv
ing- a simple life and in training.

what Is more live on It until the crack
of doom, and there Is but one thing to
do and that is point out a remedythart

10The low coiffure calls for a certata
style of neck of Its own. Indeed, ea
building a gown, a modiste will inquire
whether you are to wear your hair
high or low. If high, then your, stock
can be pretty tall, built up and ruffled
and trimmed in the new styles of the
season. .But. if the hair Is worn low.
In a coll or a low hanging braid, thea
it calls for a certain way of making
the "neck, of the gown.
Mrs. Samuel Sloane Chauncey, the
rich American widow, who has been re
ported engaged so many times, wears
her hatr low in a very girlish coll. Ia
fact, she enhances her already youth
ful charms until she is very young hi
appearance, suggesting a debutante
rather than a widow. And one of her
recent and prettiest gowns is made of
leaf mold brown taffeta, trimmed
with many little ruffles o* white lace.
The waist has a yoke made of narrow
bands of lace Insertion, all pieced to
gether, while the stock is very low. not
more than an inch high and finished
with a ruffle of Valenciennes lace. The
girdle is made of white Liberty, with a
big pearl clasp In front
The high stocks are not shaped
stocks by any means, but are round
and fastened at the back In a pretty
way. The high wire and pointed
stocks are Â«not worn at alL It is rather
the tall round stock, and the kind*
that fasten in simple ways and are
made In straight simple lines rather
than the very stiff effects. That kind,
the tall wired neck, seems to hare
melted away into thin air.
The question of how to trim the
neck Is one that must not be trea4^
ed lightly' So much has been done la
the way of stocks that fashion seem*
to have come to a standstill, wondering
what is to be done next
There is a disposition toward the
preservation of the round neck for win
ter. And, In anticipation of this, ther*
are numbers of fur necklaces now o^
fered in the shops. A fur necklace, b*
It told, is wide and flat ana Is to be
thrown around the neck and fastened
at the chin. It is something like a bo*,
but very much wider and flatter.
They are making the fur necklaoe*
of baby Tamb and are flattening them
out to make them very thin. They alse>
make them of the other furs and of
velvet trimmed with fur. There are
of the neck, they exhale fragrance.
and they are worn exclusively wllii
the high coiffure, never with the low.
'Â¦* . Â¦ The Illsh and Low Coiffure.
And there is another stock that is
quite as easy to make, and it ia one
that has been worn a great deal thi3
summer. It is made by taking a strip
of lace Insertion eighteen inches long
'and finishing it - with little hooks and
eyes for the back of the neck. At th^
front there are fastened two tabs side
byjslde. The tabs are made by sewing
lace medallions together. Take three
medallions and attach them In such a
way as to make two tabs. Sew them
to the neck so that they hang neatly
over the 'bust This gives something of
the stole effect and Is very becoming.
It is amazing to note how generally
women are taking to the simple line
of stocks. Mrs. Garret A. Hobart, who
is one of the best dressed women in
the world, Is wearing, simple white
needlework stocks, put around the
throat in the plainest prettiest fash
ion and fastened at the back with in
visible hooks and- eyes. If preferred,
the stock can be secured at the back
gun metal to exactly match her blouse.
It Is easily managed, you see, this mat
ter of blouses and skirts, if you make a
study of it
The most perplexing problem is the
skirt, which- must be either long-jor
short You can put on the rather cling
ing skirt, with the train, which Is the
skirt for the house and for receptions
and for carriage wear. But for street,
for walking, for shopping, for Informal
callingâ indeed for all except very
dressy purposesâ fashion calls for the
skirt that swings clear from the floor.
If the same thing Is "desired In a white
blouse there can be chosen a white peau
de cygne, which has its own luster, and
into It there can be set white lace pan
sles, with a little blue stitchery around
each one. .With this there must be a
collar of Hungarian embroidery, show
ing more red and brown, and the belt
and' cuffs must match. Thus you' have
the making of another very pretty
street suit. Strings of beads of semi
precious stuff will carry out the scheme
of the embroidery.
There Is a pretty stock which is
youthful and always becoming. It .is
made of insertion, through which rib
bons are run. The band Is just wide
enough "and just long enough for the
neck, and the ribbons are run through
it and tied at the back. Three or four
narrow ribbons are very neat. if knotted
in little bows at the back of the neck,
just under the low coiffure. This sort
of stock can be worn with any dress.
The Newest in Stocks.
course, aiiumer tone combined with it,
a light blue which is seen only in the
narrowest lines, such as tiny folds and
pipings. And wherever you see a blue
piping you will see a white one close
along side.
The skirt of this gown Is long and,
though full, it is not one of those ex
tremely full skirts. There is a train
and the front and the sides are snug,
that is, they â¢ are held down close by
bands of trimming.
The skirt is made df three very scant
puffs and between the puffs therÂ© are
rows of pinking, , ragged and decora
tive, and the blue pipings seem to come
in between the puffs and . the piping.
There is a Directoire coat with collar,
lapels, cuffs and wide girdle of. cloth
of silver. This suit Is one to be recom
mended to any woman who buys one
and only one handsome suit- . -
Every woman, no matter how pov-.
erty-stricken she may be, is entitled to
one fine gown a season. Many women
prefer to wear old clothes, neatly
patched or tastefully remodeled, on all
other occasions. But when a very nice
event occurs they want to have one
fine gown. And this is a point of view
taken by many women who are well
dressed.
For the woman who Is going to^ave
one handsome " frock there Is nothing
that will appeal to the taste more than
a nice silk dress. But from points of
durability the new soft fine t ladles
cloths are best They come now in the
most exquisite, deep tones with color
suggestion for trimming them. There
is a lightweight broadcloth which, in
the biscuit colors, makes up as fine as
the finest satin. .
In all the shops they will show you
handsome dark cloth materials, "such
as the popular leaf mold brown, or:
cranberry ' red, or deep sea green or
black, and they will drape your ma
terial with some contrasting, color to
set: it off and to give, you an Idea of
the color harmonies. Whole suits are.t
very pretty feather necklaces, very flat
and very soft and just the thing to be
thrown around the throat of a gown
tHs?t is cut low or rounding in the neck.
A great many shirt waists and shirt
waist suits are made with this round
or Dutch neck. The neck is finished
with a cording or with a little frill or
ruffle. This is shirred around the throat
and the waist is trimmed to match.
For day wear these necks are never
low enough to show the throat, but the
whole of the neck is exposed. The
fastening is quite simple, consisting of
a little pearl button at the back, and
the front is charmingly girlish. .For
evening the neck can be a little rounder
and slightly more Inclined to reveal
the lines of the throat and neck, but
they should not by any means be low.
.With this style of neck the necklace,
be it fur or feathers, or be it made oÂ£
chiffon ruffies.- Is a necessity, and. from
the minute the first fall breexea blow
It should be worn. The round neck la
the street Is only pretty hi midsummer,
not by any means in the fall and
winter.
The best finish is a little frill of lace
or a narrow muslin ruffle and, if: the
gewn be very nice, the lace frill can
be made of Valenciennes lace or of any
other fashionable lace, but the flnlsa
must be simple.
There is something n&r to be told
about the linen collars with lace Inset.

under a chou of tulle.
And speaking of the tulle choux.
they are, now made similar and round
er, so that they look like a little ball
of cloud. They are light airy and
very , becoming, and, with the high
coiffure, they are quite the thing. They
come in ail the pastel colors, and a
woman who alms to be well dressed
should certainly keep a dozen of them
on hand. There are little sachet
lined boxes into which these can be
laid and sweetly scented.
It would hardly seem as though the
question of scents were part of a fash
ion article. Yet perfumes enter so
largely into gowning .that no dress
maker ignores then and no trousseau,
summer or winter, is complete without
due attention to them. The latest fad
is the scenting 1 of the dress skirt with
a dozen little flat hearts filled with sa
chet and hung by ribbons from the
belt line underneath the skirt A
woman walked up Fifth avenue the
other day -with a chatelaine dangling
from her belt Hanging in among the
silver articles were narrow white rib
bons, to the end of each of which was
attached a sachet bag.
Exquisite odors that suggest the col
ors of the gown are again the fad.
White orchid, pink,. violet and all the
other scents have their appropriate
colors, and clever modistes are fur
nishing hats, girdtes and gowns with
their own subtle scent
As for the little choux at the back
lty. A small bordering of this lace
finished the cuffs. With this waist
there went a wide girdle of brown
suede of the kind that is meant to
wrinkle. It was fastened in front with
an Immense gold buckle. A string of
gold beads falling to the waist line will
be worn with this.
The third blouse was white in a soft
taffeta of, very bright finish, looking
almost as lustrous as LIbertv. A' deep
yoke of Venetian point was set' in the
neck and there were sleeves attached
to the voke. This was the only trim
ming the. gown boasted. The lace yoke
and sleeves, being all of one piece, gave
the I French touch, which so many
blouses have this. season.

collar and . cuff s, and the pipings and
sometimes the folds and the pinkings
are in another shade. ,
There is quite a little fancy for
building a shirt waist suit all of one
tone without a hint 'of contrasting
color or in mixed goods. There* cornea
for fall the most delightful mixed suits
In gray, with splashes of red and blue
and green. These have the nub effect
and' make up- into very pretty shirt

girdle and the chemisette.
The nattiest of the fall shirt waists,
with their skirts, are made on tho

can â¢ be worn if desired. Many wear
only the chemisette, consisting of the

In such demand, it takes years to
gather together enough for a fine trous
seau. The heavy German Val. lace is
most used just now, and,, in the deco
rative laces, there is nothing that
equals Irish crochet and the heavy
laces of France.
The Heavy Shirt Waist.
One way to make a shirt waist is to
get very heavy linen. Let it be as
coarse as hop sacking, but not as
rough. It will show every thread of
the weave. This kind of linen makes
a very nice waist for winter. Let the
color be a cream white, for this holds
its style winter and summer.
Now the fashionable fad is to take
a big, round collar of Irish crochet and
for the trimming of this \yaist work
the collar Into regular goods. Let it
lie upon the shoulders in regulation
collar style, but spread it wide. Some
times It takes two to go around the
neck when they are laid out in th&
manner. Now applique them into linen
and finally dampen the whole and press
the lace into the heavy cloth. The re
sult is curiously like embroidery or like
a very expensive lace Inset.
They are taking all the old linen waists '
and coloring them a deep blue. There
is a shade of blue which dyes charm
ingly and the heavy linen waists that
have done duty as white waists all
summer are now dipped and made new
for winter.
Dame Fashion has declared for ths
white waists so long that now her
eyes begin to turn toward the blue
waists and the . cranberry colors and
the other deep tints. There is a love
ly shade of willow green which is v*ery
desirable for fall waists, either in
heavy linen or in light weight cloth.
"Take your old white linen suits,"
counsels a wise woman upon fashion
topics, "and have them dipped for fall
wear. Take my word for.lt. they can
bs worn until snow flies."
* Heavy dark linen suits were worn
under cloth coats with cellars of lur
all last fall In London.
All of these things and many others
go to show the great vogue of the.
wash waist whether for winter, or for
summer wear.

cessary condition for that point of
view," Temarked the genuine girl
from the West.
"Tell me your ideas on the subject,"
I asked.
"Speech! speech!" cried the girls in
a chorus.
"What Is that stamp?" demanded
the Western girl with bristling aggres
siveness. "His scholarship will com
pare favorably with the Yale man's
and his manners."
And. as usual among women the
world over, abstract discussion culmi
nated in very personal prejudice. The
broad horizon with which we began
was shortened. The perfect "type" was
lost sight of in tha concrete reality.
"I trust he Is labeled 'all wool and a
yard wide,' " laughed Miss New York,
emerging from the pillows.
The eyes of the girl took fire from
her flaming cheeks.
"Wellâ he is!" was the only retort
she made.
"Ten to one you axe in love." sang
out Miss New York. r"with all your
boast of generalities." Further remarks
from that source were smothered by
the direct application of a pillow.

thereby excusable, because it never
ceased to surprise.
A gale of laughter greeted this con
cise statement. The gauntlet was
thrown down, and the lists were open
to all who chose to enter and defend
the worth of man.
"Not so hard, Jonesy," began Miss
New York, leading the opposition; "it
depends on what college he went to."
"Explain," I interrupted, sighting a
nugget .and trying not to lose sight of
science In my personal interest.
I turned the leaves of memory back
to the society girls I had Just left, who
placed a special premium upon the
scalps of college men en masse, and I
noticed a marked passage which said
that even a collece freshman Is better
than no college man at alL Point one
âcollege girls differentiate. I was
ready for the explanation.
It came in the form of a lively dis
cussion. The girl from New York
thought the Harvard man was "boor
ish," while others combined to praise
his "mannlshness."
"He is a conceited poser a^nd most
ridiculous," said the Burne-Jones girl.
"He looks collegiate without being
6louchy," answered the defense.
"He'd like to look collegiate If he
were not so vain," retorted Miss Burne-
Jones.
"Vain?" protested she of the Boston
ese accent. "He is as free from vanity
as members of the English nobility; as
assured of his own position and su
periority as any belted earlâ there he
is, utterly indifferent to public opin
ion. Merely to say 1 am a Harvard
man' Is a sufficient warrant of pres
tige."
THE 'â¢college girl" and her opin
ions are always spicy, Interest-
Ing and . refreshing, even when
gathered singly, but I found the
rivalry and spontaneity of what,
Jn collegiate parlance, is commonly
called a 'bunch of girls" too choice
end, for me, too rare a thing to lose
one minute of my stay among them.
In her infrequent hours of ease the
â¢"college girl" irises oracular state
ments with flippancies, Bophtstry and
ingenuity in engaging fashion. The
tammum bonum of existence and the
latest method of making fudge, the
socialistic redemption of humanity and
the newest models In neckwear appeal
to her Interest. In these discursive
snoods the is not above taking 'the
measure of a "mere man.**
I had a sneaking Idea that the differ

mere temporary pose In which they '

the public would give them audience,

I had set myself the task of proving
my theory, and then boldly removing
the mask and setting right the long

By this time (two days) I felt -well

careful of your diet, eating plain,

A DAINTY BATHROBE (Violet).â
As you enjoy making pretty things for
yourself In preference to buying
ready made garments. I think you will
experience very little difficulty in mak
ing a charming bathrobe. While there
are numerous flannels, Turkish cloth,
etc., for the purpose, an ideal robe for
winter Is made of a fine wool bed
blanket. The problem of whether
the robe will spot or launder is set
tled once for all if-you use this blan
ket, and the wearing qualities and
beauty are dependent only upon th?
quality selected. As you prefer deli
cate color combinations, why not
choose a cream white blanket with
rose or blue border, even though the
delicate gray la more practical? Do
not attempt to cut the robe by guess.
Seemingly shapeless garments require
careful cutting to be successful. Any
large pattern house can supply you
with a pattern for a blanket bathrobe
if you so specify. Calculation Is mads
in such a pattern to utilize the bor
der of the blanket for trimming with
out cutting except where absolutely
necessary and with the least wa3te.
The edges are prettiest when com
pleted with a binding of Inch satin
ribbon to match or harmonize with
the color or stride of the border. The
conventional cord girdle can be pur
chased ready for use, but as It seemi
rather heavy and masculine, why not
make a girdle of knotted ribbon? A
novel idea Is to run three strands of
rose colored ribbon, each of different
shade, through three clusters of cro
cheted rings, leaving sufficient length
to tie in front and tie the ends in a
succession of knots about six Inches
apart- Crocheted slippers made of
rose colored worsted or silk to match
should carry out the color scheme:
these slippers are to have soles of
lambs* wool or. if you prefer, you may
have slippers in white or tan colored
canvas, such as are used for bathroom
purposes.
TREATING ENLARGED PORES.
(Marjorie). â It will require persistent
effort and considerable time to re
duce the siza of enlarged pores caused
by pressing out blackheads, but if you
will faithfully follow directions you
will see a decided improvement In
two months â perhaps less. Friction,
a complexion brush, accompanied by
the liberal use of hot water, soap and
an astringent lotion, are necessary to
subdue enlarged pores. Distended
pores catch and hold an Immense
amount of impurities, so that unusual
care must be bestowed upon washing
the face, for all grime and waste mat
ter must be eradicated before the
pores will dose to the normal size.
Hastily closed, without sufficient puri
fication, will surely result in pimples.
Allow at least one-half hour each
night before retiring to treat the face,
for the manipulation of the skin is of
paramount importance in effecting a
cure. With hot water and a bland
soap that Is pure make a thick
lather and rub well into the skin
with the finger-tips, going over the
surface several times; then wash off,
using hot water. Lather the com
plexion brush and gently scrub the
face, being particular to reach up
Into the edge of the hair and over the
entire neck. Wash off all soap in dear
water, then rinse the face thoroughly
in cold water and dry. with gentle
friction. Massage the face with the
finger tips, giving care to the parts
affected with enlarged pores; then
apply this astringent lotion to the
coarse pores, rubbing In well. Mix
thoroughly one ounce of glycerine.
two ounces of elder-flower water and
two drams of powdered alum. In the
morning wash off all traces of the
lotion, rinse In cold water, and lastly
add fifteen drops of tincture of ben
zoin to a pint of cold water and sponge
the face and neck. This will act as a
mild astringent and aid in whiten
ing the skin. While It Is doubtful if
the tiny red veins on the nose can be
wholly concealed, the treatment pre
scribed will improve the circulation
to such an extent that the color will
be gradually reduced to a normal
state.
FREEING THE HAIP. FROM DAN
DRUFF (Miss D.).â Dandruff is the re
sult of a mild form of tetter, a mus
cular disease of the skin; the particles
are then drv and white. When dan
druff arises from Irritation caused by
oversupplied and clogged oil glands of
the scalp, the deposit ia very greasy
and more or less discolored. In either
case frequent shampooing Is Invalu
able In cleansing the scalp. Do not be
persuaded to use a fine tooth comb, for
this little Instrument has laid the foun
dation of many dandruff-crowned
heads by establishing a chronic irri
tation of the sensitive pores. Again,
never shampoo the hair while it Is
filled with dandruff, but first clean It
in the following manner: Divide the
hair In small strands and with a mod
erately stiff brush go over the entire
scalp several times in short gentle
strokes to dislodge the particles which
cling to the scalp. Then go over the
scalp again with the finger tips, rub
bing lightly. This will loosen the re
maining particles. Divide the hair
in four parts, for the sake of conveni
ence, take a portion in the hands about
twelve Inches from the scalp and
shake the hair briskly. You will be
surprised to see how readily the dan
druff will falL When no more can be
dislodged, brush the hair thoroughly,
using a perfectly clean brush. This
may ?eem like a good deal of ado. but
it is quite useless to wet the hair while
dandruff lurks In its meshes, for no
amount of rinsing will get It all out,
and any remaining particles will re
appear the instant the hair Is dried,
especially if the dandruff Is of the
â¢white crder. Be particular about
brushing the hair twice dally to dis
lodge any particles of dandruff, and
use a good hair tonic until the scalp 13

druff can usually be banished by per

out the delusion ornament the crust
with little gashes through the center,
then lay on a smooth surface covered
with a thick towel and pass a hot flat
iron cuickly over the surface of the
paper to slightly scorch It and simu

souvenirs In the pan with a long

each gift, this ribbon to match the
color of the table decorations. Hold
the streamers together and slip them
through the center of the paper crust

a little flour paste to the sides of the
pan. Cover the joining with a full

(Ida). â Simplicity characterises all
mourning garments, although they be
cut on the most approved models of
the day. Simplicity is obtained by the
material, absence of all elaborate
trimmings and copying only the plain
est of graceful models. The quality
of the material should be as good as
one's means will allow, as black fab
rics, especially crape, quickly become
shabby. When buying cloth, s^lk,
straw hats. etc. always ask for dull
finished mourning goods. For your
wool house dresses select Henrietta
cloth, Eudora. voile, cashmere, alba
tross, dull finished silks, crepe de
chine or Japanese silk is suggested
when a dainty and cool dress is de
sired. Plain black lawn, mull or Swiss
trimmed with ruCles of the same make
pretty, inexpensive house or street
dresses for very warm weather. Of
course, all linings, . petticoats, etc.,
worn under these sheer fabrics must
be of dull black. Street costumes may
be fashioned from serge, dull finished
black broadcloth, cheviot, camels' hair
or Venetian cloth. Folds of crape,
ruchings of chiffon or rows of narrow
grosgrain ribbon may be used to trim
the house dresses, while crocheted
buttons and machine stitching adorn
the strictly walking suits. For the
more dressy two-piece suits mourning
gimp, crape fold3, silk and passe
menterie made expressly for this pur
pose will afford j correct decoration.
Wear suede gloves for all ceremonious
occasions and black lisle thread or silk
when the former would be too warm.
Mitts are very little worn. It Is mere
ly a matter of Individual taste whether
a bonnet and long veil or hat with
draped veil be worn; both are cor
rect. The latter, however, Is most
popular with women under 45.' The
draped veil may be of Brussels net
edged with a fold of crape or of chif
fon. Ask for mournlng^vell and any
milliner can drape it gracefully. Nar
row turnover collars and cuffs of fine
hemstitched white linen and black
chiffon ruchings are both permissible.
FOR INFLAMED EYELIDS (Viola).
Eyes which have become weak and In

should bo protected by colored glasses
and all treatment be of a soothing na
ture until normal conditions are re
gained. Glasses of a delicate gray are
most restful; the very dark glasses,
while more protective, are apt to strain
the sight if an effort is made to see
any object clearly, hence this benefit is
doubtful unless dense shade is Impera
tive. When the glasses are not worn
be careful to carry a parasol of black,
dark blue or green as offering the most
restful shade; white and red parasols
are simply ruinous to the sight and
should not be used. If the eyes itch
and feel irritated do not yield to the
temptation of rubbing them, for thÂ»
unnatural .motion and the atoms of
dust on the finger tlp3 will increase the
inflammation in a marked degree. Al
most instant relief 13 felt by bathing
the eyes with cold water In which has
been dissolved just enough fine table
salt to give the saltiness of tears. If
the pain 13 great, bind or hold a cloth
saturated with cold water on the eyes
for a half hour or longer, keeping it
cool by rcdipping occasionally. Bathe
the eyes occasionally with a solution of
boric acid, ten grains to one ounce of
distilled, or. failing this, use two parts
of witch hezel to one part of water.
Use a medicine dropper to put the so
lution directly Into the eye, hold the
head backward, drop in the solution
and wink the lids several times to force
the remedy under the inflamed lids.
After a little practice it will be easy to
do thin. Repeat several times each day.

used in connection with eye treatment
must be surgically pure. Keep out of

THE LATEST UN* SLEEVES
(.Vanity). â The dominating part of all
up-to-date waists is the new cut of
sleeves. Fashion, ever ready to offer
its devotees a multiplicity of variety.
has succeeded beyond our wildest
dreams In the matter of sleeves for
autumn and winter gowns. Even the
standard bishop sleeve has taken on
new curves, which distinguishes it
from former seasons by a seam and
darts to take ux> the fullness at the
waist and give the latest pouch at the
elbow, while the cuff Is cut attached
to the sleeve by clever shaping.. The
salient feature of the sleeves on im
ported model waisjs is their Immense
fullness, which makes It almost hope
less to attempt to remodel a Cne waist
unless the material can be matched or
combined. In some models the mass
of fabric Is held rather flat at the
shoulders by being laid la deep
unstitched plaits; again, fine tuck?
stitched half the length of the sleeve
are employed and the surplus width
shirred into the arrahole. A novel
long shoulder effect is developed in a
new shirred model by a clever bit of
shirring extending partly through the
length of the sleeve and about six
inches down from the shoulder seam.
The waist is seamless on the shoulder
and shirred alons where the shoulder
seam ordinarily is. and the rows of
shirring in the sleova blend in to
gether perfectly; in fact, some of thÂ«
finest waists are cut so that the sec
tions of waist and sleeves are In a
single piece. Deep, close cuffa obtain.

cleanses the pores and is a positive
blessing to the girl with rough skin. If
exercise is followed by a bath of warm
water and soap and then a cool soonee
or shower bath to close the pores and
tone uo the skin there will be a most
remarkable improvement noted in th-?
complexion by autumn, if you arÂ«
careful not to get badly sunburned and
refrain from clogging the pores by as
indiscriminate use of powder and
creams.

some sheer material whose preitiness
and daintiness will more than offset its
Â¦rht.
Potpourri ard pine needles are about
=:.v of one and half a dozen of the
ether when it comes to popularity, so
â¢ r.fc ought r.ct to be mentioned without
the other. It is a singular fact that ia
this progressive age the art of the per
fumer has not fundamentally changed
and it is to be doubted whether the
fe-.:is of to-day, aided by modern
Krfence. make any better ointments or
street smelling sachets than did tha
p:rls in the time of Moses.
It is a well-known fact that there
ere no mere than eight flowers which
ylrld oils and that the perfumer must
combine these if she wishes to Imitate
the odor of any other Cower. Of course,
certain people have made a business of
this art and havÂ« succeeded so well
that there are to-day some sixty odd
extracts en the market that may be
had for the mere asking. Every
Sower is represented and dozens of
names have been utilized and even In
vented, so that each and every one of
the delicate odors may be distinctly
characterized in some fashion.
There are not many pomades or
sachets that are advisable to make
at home, bet the old-fashioned rose
Jar Bast be kept well filled and this
most decidedly is work for home hands.
The first thin* is to strip the roses.
Be careful to keep the leaves entire if
yea can, for they are not only prettier,
Vet seen to retain their odor far better.
There art two ways to make a pot
pourri, and oae is Just about as good as
the other. Put absolutely nothing Into
the receptacle but the petals of the
roses and salt. Rose petals, by the
way, must be used for all foundations,
as no ether Cowers will hold the flavor
ef Itself. Alternate layers of rose
petals and salt, pressing the salt down
cpon the petals. When the scent be
comes evident any other fragrant
Cower or petals or even leaves may
fc* added, such as violets, lemon ver
bena er geranium leaves. Cover the jar
with a tight Hd and after a day or so
the room win be Cooded with a deli
docs perfume every time the cover is
removed, and by being a little careful
the Jar will be a perfect well of sweet
ress for months at a time.
Wild roses gathered during the sum
mer months are most desirable, for
they breathe an odor peculiarly their
cwn. If cne cannot collect enough to
answer the purpose, the petals of va
ne us cultivated roses may bÂ« added
and yet there will longer be a faint
suspicion cf the woods.
The other way is a trifle more com
plicated. In the first place the leaves
ere thoroughly sun dried and the
greatest of care should be taken to
see that they do not gather mold dur
ing this progress. Up and down, over
and over they should be turned, for
the half-decayed odor which lingers
with mold Is anything but agreeable.
The secret of this potpourri lies in
mixing the Ingredients. The petals are
packed down in a Jar or bowl, with
alternate layers of salt. Cover the top
of the bowl with a plate or something
that will fit down snugly. Every
twenty-four hours remove the cover
from the jar and Etir the contents op
Â¦welL Do this each day for one week, "
at the er.d of which time add three
ounces of allsplee. Then mix and stir
the mass each morning for three days
more, being careful to add each day
a quarter of an ounce of allspice and
ground cinnamon.

WHAT WOMEN WANT TO KNOW

the dark epoch, of the eighties â when the liberty of the subject
(so that subject were a girl) was as yet but dimly understood. Since then
the vvorldhas made great strides, but Fairford Manor has stood still. And
so a time-honored observance exacts that, an hour and a half before din
ner, we poor womenkind shall "seek our apartments." With what object,
real or ostensible, I am at a dead loss to divine. And though mv room
is a charming one, commanding a view of fields, now rich with buttercups.
I've no desire to be a orisoner in it. Howbeit, by mamma's earnest re
quest, when at Rome I do as the Romans do. It has at least the advan
tage of taking one back'in fancy to those. old starched days of Miss Edge-
worth's and Miss Ferricr's novels. But, more than this, I have* been told
that oh occasion her ladyship can show herself a very active and effi
cient whipper-in, allowing 'neither stragglers nor estrays. You will under
stand that I have no desire to prove her power in this respect. So I fall
into line. Besides, I believe that I belong to rather an old-fashioned fam
ily myself. Dear Romeo, do you consider this a great defect in me? I
shall not be happy till I know from your own lips that you do not. There

I hat Love, who laughs at -tocksmiths, stands aloof from tlie handiworkiof
clockmakers? Love's sun is not that garish orb just now in act of descend

* * It was sweet of you
to write. Believe me, Romeo, you
were not more loth to see "me
ro than I was to take my departure.
But our hostess in this house is
somewhat of a martinet. Her
views arc '.i<Â«t modern â far from
ful â not a sound rising above the^faint hushed stir, of woods and flowing
water, save now when from a tree upon the lawn a screech owl utters ita
sharp cry as of complaint. Dearest, this mood of nature is in harmony
with mine â it soothes and steals me from myself. And yet I cannot give
myself to nature as I once could â you, Juliet, come between us. That
-happy hour we spent in the conservatory â I am living it o'er again in rec
ollection. My love", I thank you for it. "And yet how nearly it was lost to
us! Oh, Juliet, what poor, frail, dependent creatures lovers arc! Our hap
piness, so unspeakable, is so much at the mercy of the first comer. I >h;ill
never forget this lesson, should I live to gray antiquity â to be considerate to
all lovers. Only remember! When I joined you in the conservatory, all
was as yet dire uncertainty^ Should we be allowed to follow our devices
- â you and I, the company in general: or. would some hideous mandate,
some malign proposal, issue from headquarters, which with a touch
should shatter and annihilate the bubble of onr bliss. As I saw how pre
carious was the 'situation. I trembled â positively trembled. For why is it.
Juliet â can you tell me â that there are so few people in this world of ours
who are content to live and let live â so few who can be happv in their own
way, and let others be happv in theirs? In brief, the question resolved it
â¢ self into this: would the evening be devoted to delightful idleness and inde
pendence, or to hateful industry, assuming the shape of some sad game,
in which all must join or show good reason why? Much was at stake;
yet for a time all himg in the balance. Then that dear Lady Ernestine sat
down at the piano â mark mv words. Juliet, that woman is a good woman.
'Twas-a move in the right direction â a move in favor of individual effort,
and against collectivism. My spirits rose; but that was premature. There
was a great risk still to be passed. For, scarcely, darling, had we settled
ourselves agaipst the screen of a superb magnolia, when across the masses
of dark leaves and milky cups there camera grating voice: "You two are
wanted to play Bridge." Oh, cursed spite! It was the voice of that hook
nosed Miss Arrowsmith. a girl I never liked. Then, indeed, mv hopes
teemed toppling â another moment, and they must have crashed to the
ground. But our good angel befriended us. Though I share to she full
in the prejudice of the penniless against millionaires, I have always in
. stinctivcly liked Mr. Tirlington. You had made a conquest of him. and he
has thereby proved himself a man of taste. Old TirlinRton now effected
a diversion in our interest.- His word ca.rries weight with the entire
household â we were saved. A blessing on his lyart locks, and may the
mines of Kimberley yield him diamonds galore! That hour together was
the sweeter for having been so nearly lost to us. * * * Did you
share my. emotions, love? And now my cigarette lies cold and charred
upon the window sill. Dearest, good-night â good morrow. T should say.
I turn to sleep and dream of you. / ROMEO.

perhaps you don't take sugar, sir. * * * Did I share vour emo
tions, you ask. I should think so, indeed! But, my dear, you may trust
my woman's eyes to see through a stone wall half as far again as vours.
You are pleased to say that I have made a conquest of the millionaire:
.well, at any rate, I am at.no loss to explain Miss Arrowsmith's eagerness
to play Bridge. Romeo! I hate that girl â no, I only pity her. You have
never given her encouragement, deaf. But that is not her fault. As for
Mr. Tirlington, he is a darling. With how much nuiet tact. he effected our
release from the scheming minx! Now it is your turn to be jealous, dear.
Seriously, I heard old T.'s history yesterday, and it is most sympathetic.
You know that he has never married. Well, it appears that in quite earlv
â¢ life he was deeply attached to a beautiful young girl, who cared^very much
for him. Neither of them had a penny. Prudence triumohed. and he went
abroad to woo the goddess Fortune. For a long time she (the goddess,
I mean) was obdurate; and when at last he saw his fortunes mended it was
only to learn that his sweetheart had fallen a victim to an incurable mal
ady. This explains LTo remaining single. But though he has never mar
ried, he is a strong advocate of early marriages. Lady Fairford told this
yesterday, not to myself, but to Lady Ernestine. Yes, certainly, he is a
dear old man, and I am truly grateful to him. * * * Romeo, a
plan! I am a little wearv of that earnest a'nd detailed inspection of the
horses in the stables everv morning. Shall we this mornhig give the rest
of the party the slip, and have the boat out on the oool below the belve
dere, instead? There is no time for a written answer, dearest, so, if you
mean >'cs, offer me marmalade at breakfast. You know I never touch it.

No. 5. ,R. Montagu to Miss Capulet. â¢ Midnight.
Juliet! What can this mean? I know not if I stand upon mv head or
heels. But let me endeavor to collect my scattered senses and explain.
On my going to the smoking-room this evening (for to have deserted it
twice in succession would have attracted attention) old Tirlington called
me to him. saying he wished to speak to me. I supposed it must be on
some question concerning the procedure of our English law courts â a
subject in which he takes a good deal of interest, and as to which he his
repeatedly come to me for . information â which I have givÂ¥n him as best
Â¦ I could. Judge of my amazement when to-night, instead of sending me
to drag out my neglected law books from their repose in my portmanteau,
he told me in so many words that he required a private secretary, and
made me a point-blan.c offer of the oost. As you may imagine. I. the.
brieflesj. who had never ftad but one big bit of luck in mv life before
(you know to what I allude, dear) I was completely* taken aback. I could
not believe my senses. But there must be a hitch somewhere. Perliaus
the post, though otherwise desirable, was unpaid. Not at all â the salary
was a very handsome one. And. after many Questions asked and an
swered. I could hear of but one difficulty in my way. And what do von
think that difficulty was? Why that I was a bachelor â ha. ha! For it
seems that the old buffer, who entertains largely both here and in Cane
Town, would have preferred (had that been possible) to have a ladv in the
house to receive his guests. Had that been possible! Oh, Juliet! will yon
help me surmount this difficulty? You have already promised that yon
would. Do not desert me now. * * * Oh, that 'twere morning!

throughout the afternoon. And I thought of dear papa, who is so formid
able, though so good, and of all that you had just been telling me about
the years of waiting at the bar before work comes. Then I felt certain
that papa would never see these things as we saw them, never believe in
your bright future, or in the help that I could be to you. And then I felt
so disheartened that I broke down, and, being quite alone. I cried. But^
while my eyes were still inflamed with crying, who should come along but
Mr. Tirlington. And he asked me, speaking in the kindest voice, to tell
him all about it. And I did tell him all about it. I yielded to the impulse
of the moment, but of course I never dreamed of what would come of it.

TRUE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE ELEPHANT
in a remote quarter, they seem to know
Ix. intuitively and their sorrow is as
plain to the eye as a human being's.
At such a time their trunks hang limp,
their eyes overflow with water and
their bodies lose that swinging motion
which they seem to be forever enjoy
ing. -T>
. "Their fondness for baby elephants
is almost human. The little one owned
by Ringling Bros, is a wonderful com
fort to the big herd. This youngster
is now over a year old and is as full
of mischief as a young colt. We give
him the liberty of the big barn, because
if we didn't he would wnlne and whim
per so as to get the whole elephant
herd into the dumps. He gets tha best
of everything that is fed to his elders.
and is selfish enough to take it all
even if- he can't eat it. It is fun to
see him try. to hide things that h-j
doesn't want, just for the mere sake
of keeping them. I am at a loss to
figure ihis out because his mothd was
an ur.selfljh' beast and his fath-3. was
a jolly, good-natured fellow, who would
lei any of his mates lick up his bran
without any . kick.
"The daughter is b<*st at her father
in-law's house and the elephant i3 best
at the Ilajah'a. Is the Indian way of
saying that daughters and elephants
are an expensive luxury. But however
that may be. and all good thins3 after
all come under the head of cost, don't
let anybody lead you into the belief
that an elephant belongs to the savase
c)uis some writers .claim."
*T E was a ' cheery, red-cheeked
L-J German and had just settled
J[ . I himself to an after dinner
*S smoke. He had probably turn
ed forty and at least half his years
had been devoted to elephant train
ing. He was known aa a close mouth
ed men, but tha experience of the day
or a pipe full of good tobacco had
broken that spell. To look after the
welfare of forty elephants, which he
must do. does not loom up as an at
tractive job, but- there were no lines
of care In his face.
"The best part of my life has been
cpeni In the company of elephants and
nearly every day somebody tells me
things about them I don't know. What
makes me most tired is the fool ques
tion about bad elephants. A bad ele
phant is a freak and is seldom come
up with. The big beast is as domestic
&s the horse, although a - little" too
cumbersome for the same uses. When
an elephant gets a little cranky, there
is always some light headed attend
ant, it seems, to fly off and say he is
crazy*. Xinety-nine times out of a hun
dred the poor elephant has been bad
ly treated and as he cannot talk he
does about the only thing he can do,
and trumpets his disgust and maybe
eases his feelings by taking a crack
with his trunk at something within
reach. If that happens to be a help-
fronr it.. You* see, I, carry a slender
stick that hardly has strength enough
in it to make a puppy yell. Yet a tap
from that will mak<? any of my big tlc
phant family obey.
Because the elephant is such a big
affair-' most people think he 'must be
full cf danger. That is all nonsense.
Did you , ever notice how fond they
are of children? Who ever heard of
an elephant hurting a child? Why. in
our winter quarters the boys and girls
will , pet them arid walk among, them
and the elephants enjoy it.
"The animal is really of a, loving
disposition and very gentle and obe
dient. I have! never known but one
runaway. How many houses could we
say that of? The poor fellow was
then frightened out- of his wits by
an exploding locomotive and. after he
had gone a few miles from the strange
noise he slowed up as if he had sensed
the thing and looked a little foolish.
A boy could have led him back to thÂ»
starting place he was so meek. An
elephant is not much on the run, any
way. His natural'ogait is" a walk. He
might increase that to a fast -shuffle
of about twelve or fifteen' miles an
hour,- for a short distance. On a flat
piece of country a good runner could
keep. out of his way, .but in the-jungle
that, could not be done unless the run
ner concealed himself.
"A lot of the stories about elephants
carry hatred for certain people and
getting square with them sooner or
laterl don't' take any stock in.. Most
of them started in India withcopper-
skinned natives, 1 who knew the white
man would swallow anything sensa
tjcna! and he would' have 1 no chance
to prove the thing otherwise. A fel-
Iojw came to me last year and wanted
to know which elephant it was that
chewed up the end of a bamboo stick
until the fiber was like a broom and
then reached it out and twisted it in
the hair of an attendant to draw him
to him so he oould crush him. I told
him the good elephant had gone to an
animal hospital to be treated for the
gout. Another fellow wanted to know
v.hich elenhant it was that refused to
ptrform while his keeper wa3 away on
a vacation, and tried to make trouble
when compelled to do his act and
finally refused to eat- anything until
thÂ«.man returned. I told him the ele
phant was now going to. night school
and could only be seen here in the
daytime.
"The real elephantâ the one I 'know â
is, the best natured wild animal in the
world. He is affectionate, loyal, obedi
ent, and as ready to learn as a child.
He looks on the cheerful side of things

"It was a good thing I did not catch
him at it,' because I know -what a bad
effect that has upon "the animal. 1

saw there was something wrong with
Jip, but the attendants said nothing.
There seems to be- a -sort ; of .Masdlriry
among them. Before, a week went by
Jip saw his chance and picked, up his
enemy in his trunk, squeezed him sav

good for. the man that he struck the

fellow was hurt a good' deal, but no
bones were- broken,' and after he got
over the i shock I' gave him -his . wages
and told him to never come. near the*
tent again. I; don't think he will.
"Now, -that elephant did., no more

was very fond of cider, as I afterward
found out. You know about a menag

named Sandy, was given a bottle of
this sweet stuff one afternoon and it
seemed to reach the right spot with
him. After that every time the at

give him a pleasant squeak of rec

good side and he began to spend a good

holding the fluttering pages in. her
hand.. " ?Â¦'Â¦:-Â¦-.
dash Into the surf. â¢ A mighty breaker
met the llfesaver. but he went through
it like ; an. arrow, and struck out for
the man, who was. coin? down for the
last time. The sea was like glass out
here and the man sank slowly. Fer
ris recognized at a glance that It was
a case of cramns.
y-ftel FERRIS, stroke on the Yale
1 crew, twined his long brown legs
\ tight around the post of the South
QJ Beach lookout and pulled his yel
low duck hat viciously over his eyes.
Then he shoved It back again' and
stared straight out to sea.
It had been a direct cut and he
hadn't expected it of her. He wished
that some foolhardy swimmer would go
out beyond his depth or be seized with
a cramp, so that he might. go out after
him and battle for life among the
breakers. But Instead It proved to be
an aggravatingly dull day. The sea was
smooth as glass, yet the bathers clung
tenaciously to the ropes.
He had always looked upon the self
supporting men at college as fellows to
be envied. They were always doing
things. It took mettle â It took nerve â
the sort of nerve he had felt the need
of that very morning when he had
looked down to meet the eyes of Nell
Standlsh changing from amazement to
a certain contempt which he could not
understand. i--
Before her coming It had been a mer
ry morning. Small boys had chased
him Joyously down the beach, and pret
ty girls and flirtatious young matrons
had cast him approving glances. He
had felt that the "wages of a private
life-saver . near a fashionable ' bathing
pavilion were doubly paid, but nowâ
The tide came booming In and drove
the bathers out of the surf, lunch gongs
summoned dawdlera from the sand and
Ferris slipped down from his po3t and
Umped swiftly toward the bathing-
Ktle tower "to d'stract -the attention of
Â£zits- occupant - from the bathers who
3 we're '...risking 1 their lives beyond the
ropes. -. â¢ â¢ â¢
â¢;Â¦ As the duya went by Ferris became
accustomed but not reconciled to her
presence at South Beach. He might
have felt better If his life had been
""a more active one, but ,the bathers
were distressingly careful. An occa
sional diish after u frightened girl 'or
the care of some "careless nursemaid's
charge was the extent of his duties a3
life-saver. v- - .
Then came an August morning
when the pongee parasol passed di
rectly under his post. The -firm.
.tanned hand which showed beneath it
clasped ,a large package of letters.
Evidently Miss Standish's mall had
. beeiva .heavy one. c She sat down on
" the j sand within the , range of Ferris
vision and opened the mall, ' which,
he could see quite plainly enough now,
. had ; been forwarded . from various
: points.
Her â¢ slim, firm hand was turning :
pages rapidly. She whirled upon her
.mother with - a sudden, excited, ex
clamation, and both women turned and
looked-at him. He felt himself; flush
even at-th!s distance.. Perhaps they
-knew* how curious he had felt about,
their "mall. He was a beastly cad..
.Suddenly, the girl rose to her feet.
She iv.aa coming directly toward him,

her hand. v:

shapelessly. aimlessly. In the white-'

house. He had not realized till then/
how tightly he had clasped his legss
around the post. Hfs position had been^
an outward and visible sign of the in
ward but not spiritual storm that*
raged. Yes, it was going to be a little
harder than he had thought. Then he
squared his shoulders and threw up his
head proudly. Â¦
. Evidently she had thought the mat
ter over and repented of her rudeness,
for that night when they came face to
face In the hotel dining-room she .
bowed to him, not with the old air of
comradeship, but, with a forced polite
ness that he felt almost as keenly as
the morning cut. He bowed gravely
and crossed to his table, which was on
the far side of the large room. Half an
hour later he was at the desk In the of
fice asking for his bill. It was Impossi
ble that he should remain In the same
house with her under the circum
stances. He had once thoughtâ But
one may think many times on an in
come of seven ' thousand a year, f
He turned abruptly, climbed â¢.'.the
stairs and commenced to throw things
into his trunk and grip. Then. he sat
down on the edge of the bed and
laughed at himself. It was all so ab
surd and childish. .This wan a -fine be-,
ginning for a chap who had his way: to
make. He was hauling down his colors
at the first shot. She would guess why
he had left, and a mere difference of
hotels could not: prevent his '- meeting
her. The resort. was small arid exclu

So he emptjed his trunk, hung up his
garments and went down :: to tell the -
clerk he had changed his mind. The
proprietor of the hotel happened to be
In the office and he looked greatly re

asked.

The girl looked up at hia earnest
face and something In It filled her
with pity. She had intended to reply
lightly. Instead her eyes fell and ehe
was silent.
"You understand, don't you?" he
gaid after a pause. \
"So. I don't understand," she said

he had been struck.

By way cf rr.akir.g conversation, I
remarked to the Ancient Miner:
"There's going to be a big wedding in
town to-night, 1 see."
"EiÂ£ weddin'? No. stranger, right
there's vhere you're mistaken. There
ain't been a big weddin' here for years;
not since Swart Pete was married.
Course there's been lots o' folks got
spliced, but as f'r big weddin's, well,"
end the Ancient Miner paused medita
tively and shifted his quid to the other
cheek. "Well, Swart Pete's weddin'
jest r.achurly laid over anythin' that's
happened 'round these dig-gin's since
Hec was a pup."
"Tell me about it," I said, scenting
a yarn.
"What, you don't mean t' 6ay, stran
ger, thet you ain't never heard 'bout
Swart Pete's weddin'? Must be 't you
ein't been Icr.g in these parts."
I reluctantly confessed that this was
my first visit.
"We 11 then, stranger. I'll Jest per
ceed t* tell you 'bout It," and the An
cient lliner tilted his chair back
against the wall and ppat meditatively
irto the distance. "But chin work is
exhaustln' exercise," he eald suggest
ively. I saw the point.
"Aini nothin' like a little nose paint
to He cp a man's reco-llector," he re
zsarked es he set down his empty glass.
"So you ain't never heard of Swart
Pete's weddin'? Well, it's 'bout time
that defect in your eddlcation was
remedied end I'll perceed to enlighten
you on the subjeck.
"This weddin'. as I was sayin' afore.
Jest plumb laid over anythin* that's
ever been pulled oft 'round this neck of
the woods. But fust I'll hev to inform
you en how it come about.
"Swart Pete come out here 'long
â¢bout th* time th' fust pay dirt was
struck In the gulch. He was a tall,
rood lookin' young German, with
black hair an' black eyes, an" a good
word rr everybody. Like all the rest
of us he spent most of his time dig
gin* holes in the mountain, but he
didn't 6eeni to hev much luck an' ther*
didn't none of his holes seem to pan
cat much.
"But 'long 'bout th' time Pete hed
been here a couple of years he struck
It â kinder accerdent'Iy. you know.
Was chasin' a runaway burro up in
one of th' gulches one day when he
happened to see a pecoollar lookin'
rock. Stopped to look at It and found
It was sure enough pay dirt.
"Well, Pete he jest Quietly staked
out his cLiim an' set to work on it an*
â¢fere lens: he hed more money'n he
knowed what to do with. Most of the
raen would hev bucked th* tiger till
It was all gone, but Peter he wasn't
thct Iclnd. But all the same he wanted
to celebrate an* he didn't know Jest
"zzctly how he was groin' to do It. Pete,
he thought an* thought, an' at last he
pot an idee. Hi would git married.
Thc-r* hadn't never been a weddin' at
Grizzly Gulch an' ko this would be
scmetbin' new.
"But ther's one pecooliar featoor
'bc-Jt jrettin' married- Ther's allus got
to be a woman in the case. Thet's
vhy I've allus fought shy of th' propo
sition. Cut Swart Pete was a dead
game n:,ort an* he wasn't 'fraid of
nothin'-r^nct even a bundle of calerco.
On!y th;n^ thet bothered him any was
whose hs was goln* to get th' female.

thet veddin' off.
"Howsomever, it so happened thet
'tout thet time ther' was a little gal
out here who'd come out to. civilize
th' natives an* Incidenfly to teach
school. ' But she found she was up
against It good an* hard. She didn't
cten'to be makin* what you might
call a howlin' success of th* clvillzln*
business an' school teachin' wasn't all
roses, Tieither. She was a nice lookin'
little piece of calerco, too. with big
blue eyes en' a wistful kind of a look
'bout her, *s if she needed somebody
to take care of her.
".'Liza'.' said the Jedge to the blushin'
bride, *do you promise to feed an' sup
port Swart Pete to the best uv your
ability, fo help you?*
"Liza looked kinder .dumfoozled, but

LONDON, Sept. 10.â The former May
Goelet, now Duchess of Roxburgh?, re
cently has become the keenest sort of
a golfer, and her friends say she soon
will be able to give her ducal hugband
points, though he is no slouch at the
"royal game." The Duchess has been
practicing regularly at the golf links
at Eallng, a suburban place noted for
the game. She had her first lessons
from the Duke at their Scottish home,
but lately she has been under the tui
tion of. Miss Sinclair, a Scotch woman
who knows more about "driving" and
"putting" than many of the male ex
perts. Princess Victoria, King Ed
ward's daughter, has taken a great lik
ing to the Duchess and the two fre
quently have- a quiet game of golf in
the private grounds at Buckingham
Palace. The rapidity with which the
Duchess has made her way Into the
royal circle Is causing much Jealousy,
especially among those who do not
know about the strong friendship that
exists between the Dowager Duchess
and Queen Alexandra.

Mr. Astor as soon as he bought
Cliveden from the Duke of Manchester,
insisted that his part of the' river was
his own particular preserve and that
no man. must fish there without his
personal permission. He fought the
Conservancy and won, but fashionable
people who go fishing have not forgot
ten an action which they regard as
arbitrary- If people want to fish there
now they must do so from boats and
not from the river banks. The worst
of It is that the fishing at Cliveden Is
about the best on the Thames. The '
Queen and Princess Victoria, both of
them enthusiastic anglers, used to fish
there not a little, but they have con
spicuously avoided the place since Mr.
Astor began to Insist on the letter of
the law.
It is this curious belligerency over
trifles that has concealed the good
qualities of a man who has been re
maihat-ly generous in bigger things. It
is said that he became so indignant at
one time over the stories that he was
trying to buy a peerage every time he
gave a big sum to charity that he
vowed he would never give away an
other penny. He never approved of In
discriminate charity, and for, this
reason he has frequently Incurred the
ill-will of persons who make a living
by parading their, so-called philan
thropic motives -before a charitable
public. When her. father ceased giving
away his money Pauline* commenced,
to open her purse strings freely. The
father presently discovered " that she
was ' disposing of more than she could
afford of her allowance^ and; he forth
with decided to abandon his determi
nation to liye up to the selfish reputa
tion he had so unjustly earned.

the Thames Conservancy over the
question of fishing rights in that part*
of the river bounded by the Cliveden
estate. The ' Conservancy Is an emi
nently popular and fashionable body.
They are responsible for the govern
ment of the river Thames from end to
end; they stock It with fish for the
purposes of providing innocent sport
for anglers from anywhere and every
where so long as they do not abuse any
of the privileges extended' to them.
LONDON, Sept. 10.â The Arachne
Club, which represents the latest ef
fort of society to solve the servant girl
problem, is congratulating: Itself on the
success which has thus far attended
its experiment. Its first batch of grad
uates, armed with certificates of com
petency, have gone forth Into domestic
service, and from mistresses and maids
alike satisfactory reports have been
received. These Arachne students of
pies and puddings and other mysteries
of household economy are all gentle
women. The promotors of the club be
lieve that as the servants in good fam
ilies they will be far better off than if
they took to typewriting, teaching and
the various overcrowded occupations
to which young ladles usually resort
when necessity compels them to earn
their- own living.
They are styled "professional ser
v*rnts." The training imposed upon'
them justifies the designation.. Whether
a girl elects to become a housemaid,
a parlor maid or a cook she has to
submit to a thorough practical course
of skilled instruction. And she Is not
allowed to make money out of her ac
complishments until she has passed
the necessary examinations and re
ceived her diploma. The club further
stipulates that to retain their connec
tion with the club the graduates must
not enter households where they wiU
be simply one among other servants
who are not gentlefolk by birth. The
result is that they either enter ser
vice In pairs, or work single-handed
in small households. They wear smart
pink . uniforms with the regulation
aprons, caps and hats which consti
tute the recognized badges of domestic
service in England. The rates of pay
demanded, for them, and they* are
pledged , not to accept less, is consid
erably in excess of the average wages
prevailing here. This is how tl >
schedule runs:
Housemaids $100 to *l.v>
Parlor maid* 10O to 150
Cooks i. 10O to 130
Cook-housekeepers and housekeep
ers 200 to 225
These figures, of course, stand for
yearly payments. It is further stipu
lated that they "Shall -be allowed from
two weeks' to one month's holiday
every year. And when out of a situa
tion they have the club to fall back on.
Of course, it Is to be expected they
will forego the usual matutinal chat
with the milkman or the breadman.
but they are free to make the most of
what matrimonial opportunities come
their way.
"I am delighted with my place,"
said one of these graduates when re
lating her experience. "As my expenses
are small my wages are practically
clearly profit. I have much more free
dom than I should have as a governess
teaching fractious children, \ or as a
day's companion combining pampered
poodles all day long and getting
snubbed by all the servants in the
house."
And there you have William Waldorf
Beyond a pollr.hed vestibule, severely
unadorned, is another room, likewise
caken, â¢ and severely plain, where sits
the Astor solicitor â an exact man, sur
rounded by neat documents, recording
with phenomenal exactness every
transaction in which the Astor estate
has been involved. If you should In
advertently pay to the Astor estate a
penny more than the precise sum you
owed, the perturbation of the Astor
solicitor would be as great as If you
paid a pennyâ or a thousand dollarsâ
less than you owed. In the room be
yond Mr. Aator's offices., and on the
floor above, is a severely beautiful hall,
where Mr. Astor occasionally gives cor
rect banquets.
DISLIKES DISORDER.
Inside all the wails are richly paneled
with polished oak, the hardwood floors
glisten like those of a ballroom, the
single oaken bench for waiting visitors
is as stiff and uninviting as a marble
â¢cat In a mausoleum. There are no
curves anywhereâ only right angles.
Behind a long, glistening counter, top
ped by a wondrous Iron grill, are two
clerks, who also appear to have been
carved out of oak. and who sit stiffly
Rt marvelouEly neat oaken desks bear-
Ing huge volumes. There is such an op
pressive air of right-angled accuracy,
exactitude, precision and strict silent
formality about the place that It would
be linpoEslble to imagine such a thing
an a blot or an erasure, or a misspelled
word in all those great books wherein
the Aster wcclth is recorded down to
the minutest item. One fancies that
even the ciphers which lend their
countenance to the highest figures of
the Actor mHllocs are written In those
ledgers In the form of squares rather
than as ovals.
Tou can get some idea of the severe
methodical formality which character
izes Mr. Astor by a visit to his really
beautiful estate office on the Thames
Embankment next to the Temple. Out
side it looks as if it might be a deli
cately designed library that has been
stationed in London for a time to be
come sufficiently aged and sooty In ap
pearance before taking Its proper place
among similar choice old buildings In,
Eay Oxford.
3IARVELOUS ANGLES.
cerning the failure of the young Duke
Of Rcxburghc to become the husband
of Pauline Astor express small patience
with the Ftories of paternal dissatisfac
tion with the present arrangement.
DESERTION OF NATIVE LAND.
His desertion of his native land ha*
been given as the reason of the unpop
ularity of William Waldorf Astor, but
that had far less to do with It than
other qualities which make this queer
specimen of millionaire uncommonly
interesting. An Englishman w..ho
knows Mr. Astor intimately and sees
him almost daily said recently that
nothing so upset this ex- American as a
chance observation in his newspaper,
the Pall Mall Gazette, or in the Pall
Mall Magazir.e, that seemed to reflect
on the United States. "It may surprise
you to know." he went on to say, "that
Mr. Astor seems to be genuinely de
voted to the United States. He told
me once that the only reason for his
leaving it. aside from certain family
matters, was his indignation at the
â¢way two or three yellow journals in
New York and a few of the other cities
had written about him and his fam
ily."
LONDON. Sept. 10.â Some of the
wildest nonsense on record has been
written about the transplanted branch
of the Actor family sinpe the announce
ment of Miss Pauline's engagement to
Captain Spender Clay. Most of it has
been ill natured and some of It ! has
been libelous and all of it has been
contrary' to William Waldorf Aster's
conviction that it is a kind of infringe
ment of copyright to so much as men
tion his name in the newspapers ex
cept in brief and formal fashion.
Probably there isn't a man in Eng
land to-day who is so much misunder
stood, who gets so little credit for his
good qualities and so much discredit
for peculiarities that apparently arise
from stiffness and irritability, rather
than from any real "cussedness." Since
the engagement of his daughter has
been announced, he has been pictured
generally as in a state of wild rage at
the thought that after all his efforts
he has not succeeded in marrying her
into the peerage. Unfortunately there
is nothing except imagination to sup
port the story. Miss Astor chose to
fall in love with a solid, substantial
and eminently euitable man of 34, who
seems to be of rather better quality
than most of the available unmarried
peers or heirs to peerages, and I under
ttand that she very promptly received
her father's heartiest blessing.
"It is hard to part with so devoted a
daughter." said Mr. Astor to a friend
who congratulated him- on the engage
ment of Pauline. "Since her mother's
death she has been the comfort of my
life and naturally one of my chief stu
dies." Those who know the attachment
that exists between father and daugh
ter, and who know the true facts con-
ways receive a handsome donation, and
in many cases the check is sent anony
mously. The Union Jack Club, of
which the Prince of Wales laid the
foundation stone a few days ago, is
also under an obligation to- the house
of Astor. This'dub is intended to ac
commodate non-commissioned officers
and men who may be passing through
London from time td time on their way
to and from the various mil'tary
depots. >,
Mr. Astor is a generous employer and
his servants speak well of. him. The
men who sell his newspapers in the
street are no* expected to run about
bawling the latest winner. They stand
at fixed points and received a fixed wage
with a commission on the sales. He
Bet the lead in this matter and one or
two of the better-class papers followed
his example. His naturalization has
made no change in his methods of con
ducting his business. He is methodical
to the point of being considered arbi
trary and this is a feature many of the
people who come into contact with him
cannot understand. His abruptness,
too, does not commend itself to his
friends. "Yes" and "no" appear to
Astor as pictured by his surroundings.
Anything a little out of order moves
him to bitterness, which probably ex
plains an incident that did more to
hurt him with London society than
could be undone by any amount of
lavish gifts of charity. Through some
misunderstanding Sir Alexander Berke
ley-Milne, one of the most popular of
society men, was present without in
vitationâwithout a formal invitation,
at least â at a big part>" given by Mr.
Astor. The host was so" irritated by
the fact that he had it published in
his own paper the next day. Now Sir
Alexander was perfectly innocent of
offense, and was, moreover, a personal
friend of the' King and Queen. Her
Majesty took especial pains that he
should be seen in her box at the opera
immediately after the publication of
the item, and since then Mr. Astor has
not had royal approval, although his
daughter has been a favorite with both
the Queen and the Prince of "Wales.
The Queen took a hand, too, in an
other dispute in which the millionaire
became involved through insistence on.
his rights, to the great detriment of his
popularity." That was his conflict with

THEATRICAL STARS
ARE TWINKLING ALL
OVER THE UNIVERSE
The three Dentons, , performers on
triple horizontal bars suspended in the
air, are going tp astonish the "Chutes'
goers this week.'
Harry La Rose and his company in
"The Sailor and the Horse," by Will M.
Cressy, are headlined at the Orpheum
this week.
"Only a Shop Girl" will be given at
the Central this week. '
The "Anheuser Push" Is still going
successfully at Fischer's, with "Miss
Mazuma," by J. C. Crawford, to re
flace If.
"The Toreador" is j In Its last two
weeks at the Tlvoli. ' "The Serenade"
will follow.
The, Grand Opera-house will have a
curious and what should be a charming
Japanese extravaganza In the "Prin
cess Fan Tan," In which some hundreds
of children will take part. Â¦.
White Whlttlesev will this week be
seen in "The Second In Command,"
tnat John Drew introduced here on h's
last visit. The Alcazar company will,

"Raffles.", the thrilling story of the
conflict between a â¢brilliant criminal
and a brilliant detective, begins Its
second week to-morrow evening. Kyrle
Bellew and E. M. Holland share honors
in the chief roles and the rest of the

The chief novelty of the dramatic
week will be the presentation by Miss
Florence Roberts this evening at the
California of Angel Guimera's "Marta
of the Lowlands," a pastoral drama
that made a considerable sensation on
its production in New York last year.
Hobart Bosworth, who was in â¢ the
original production, is in Miss Roberts'
support, and the long and careful re
hearsal of the drama seems to promise
an excellent performance.

The advance sale of seats for thÂ»
grand operatic concerts to be given by
Mme. Fannie Franclsca at the Al
hambra Theater September 21 and 24
will commence next Thursday morn
ing'at Sherman, Clay & Co.'s music
store. There have already been many
inquiries for seats, . but no orders will
be accepted -in advance of the sale.
â¢ . â¢ â¢
clsm is not a branch of the advertis
ing 'department. "In all the other pa
pers, when you want a favorable re
view of a book you go to the business
manager and arrange it. You can be
hailed as a grand master on the first
page of such .world renowned papers
as Le. Figaro or Le Journal, in a clever
leading.article signed by a well known
man. of letters, for a couple of thou
sand francs." â¢â¢ â¢ Naturally the con
verse, holds good. You may be a great
master and you may be generally re
garded as a great master, but editors
.will/ not permit . reviewers to say so
until your .publisher has Interviewed
their cashier.- In music the price Is
considerably less. Any paper, in Paris
(Including .the. three named by T. P.'s
.Weekly) will for 60 francs print a ten
line criticism of a concert written by
the. concert. giver himself or by any of
his friends. This practice has become
notorious Â¦ in Paris and hence musical
criticism" in the dally newspapers, is
regarded there . as more or less of a
farceâ although some persons can sea
nothing funny In. such a disreputable
state of affairs. A few pessimistic New
Yorkers predict the same disgraceful
conditions for New York if the busi
ness relations between visiting artists
and the critics of our dally- papers are
allowed to â¢ continue as flagrantly as
they have flourished heretofore. *.'The
only difference between the Paris and
the New York "grafting" systems is
that over there the business office gets
the money, while here the critic reaps
the . questionable gain. But the New
York critic really needs the money.
COMEDIANrWHO^TOOKrTO THE STAGE 'AFTER r A LIFEOFjDlESPERATRADVENTUREIN QUEENSLAND.
So delightfully typical I consider the
following dictum. I said: "Then you
don't care for Ibsen"â he nodded "no" â
"what about Shaw?"â greater than
Shakespeare. I remembered.
"Oh."' said Mr. Bellew, with the
most ticklesomc affability, of patron
age and a deliciou'sly . indulgent upper
inflection on the adjective: "Shaw's
quaint!"
I wanted then to put Kyrle Bellew
and Arnold Daly; into the ring, with
George Bernard Shaw as- umpire.
"Well, take her Theresa Raquln,"
Mr. Bellew instanced. "There is a play
now, to me the greatest piece of dra
matic literature In existence. You see
no eingle thing done,, only the effect of
what has gone before the play. But
you understand everything. And every
character Is absolutely lifelike. Take
Ibsen now. Ibsen creates his characters
to bring about his situations. The rela
tions betwen his men and women are
not typical. Mind, I don't say they are
not possible. But Zola gives you the
thing occurring every day, the people
to whom the thing happens. And Mrs.
Potter Is as great here as Zola. Her
Therese is the, highest art."
"Bernhardtâ Duse?" I venture.
"They have not the peculiar temper
ament," Mr. Bellew insisted.
Zola the greatest of dramtistsâ where
had I heard something like that before?
Ah, I knew. Apropos, too, I'd picked
up my old Plutarch the other day and
read in the Alexander: "The most glo
rious exploits do not always furnlsh'us'
with the clearest discoveries of virtue
or vice In men; sometimes a matter of
less moment, an expression or a jest,
informs us better of their characters
and inclinations than the most famous
sieges, the greatest armaments, or the
bloodiest battles whatsoever."
Mr. Bellew smiled and became blase
here. He sat back with the wearily
graceful air of a Raffles. It was then
I noted that above his black brows his
hair shines whitelyâ as does Raffles'.
It was then I found that Kyrle Bellew
was not born -to-day. Lazy the voice
was in which he said: "It was accident
through which I went on the stage.
I'd been to sea for eight years. When
I was paid off I went to Australia in.
one of the gold rushes. Made a lot
then; lost it. Then"â Mr. Bellew smiled
meaninglyâ "for my sins I became a
dramatic critic. But I always said nice
things about everybody!"
"Bad morality" Â¦
"Perhaps," he nodded, and resumed,
"But one night I was sent to do an
opera. I met an old captain of mine
at the theater. Told him I wanted to
go home. He couldn't take me, but he
had a friend with him, captain of a
cracks passenger boat running to Lon
don, who needed an officer"â â
"Officer?"
"Oh, I was supposed to be- a smart
sailor," Mr. Bellew remarked. "But my
old captain told the other chap, 'This
fellow's all right,' and he took me on.
How the fellows In the office chaffed
(he said "chahfed") me and my brass
buttons! But I reached London a few
weeks later with Â£8 in my pocket."
The actor chuckled then as he said:'
"I didn't know what to do, you know,
for a living:, and in looking over the
advertisements in the Daily Telegraph
I saw: 'Wantedâ A light comedian.' I
thought I was light enough, and cut off
my. brass buttons, bought a pot hat and
answered it. The manager asked me
where I came from. 'Australia,' I said.
'Work's hard there," said he. 'Yes,'
said I. 'Change the bills often?' said
he. 'Very frequently/ I said. And he
never asked me what parts I was play
ed! That's how I became engaged to
play as light comedian with Miss Helen
Barry. Ten days afterward, at the
Royal Theater, Brighton, I made a hit
â made a hit" â the actor chuckled.
"Then," he resumed, "Dion BoucI
cault saw me as Woodstock In 'Clan
carty* in Dublin, and sent for me to the
Haymarket. I was there for eleven
years. I should probably have been
there yet only 1 got Into hot water with
them, lawsuits and things, wouldn't let
me play what I wanted. Then I came
over here to Wallack's, then Abbey en
gaged me to play with Mrs. Potter"
It was not the first time that Mr. Bel
lew had mentioned Mrs. Potter. His
"man" had brought In a note from the
actress' brother, who lives here, while
we talked. I had laughed over Jrfie press
agent legend of the reconciliation of
the historically associated players. Mr.
Bellew had said that they had never
"quarreled." I had thought that he
was not ill-pleased with the opportu
nity of saying it. And I had noted the
warmth of admiration with which he
spoke of his late associate. His tone
now was instinct with hqmage.
"Abbey asked me what I thought of
her â she had only just begun to act,"
he continued. "I told him I thought she
had everything but experience that a
woman needed, beauty, voice, genius,
social knowledge â everything. After
we began I played with no one else for
fourteen -years. It was a business part
nership also for thirteen yearsâ we
played under our own management arid
in a repertoire of twenty-six plays with
only two of them that were not of the
'legitimate* genre."
"I've never seen Mrs. Potter," I said,
"she must be extraordinary."
"She is a great woman," her confrere
testified gladly, nay eagerly. "Tbere
Is na one quite like her. There is no
actress that can do quite the things
she can do."
"Such as, for example"
"Larger than , our sequoias!" I pro
tested.
Gently then Mr. Bellew said: "I think
so. In the Dandenong range the
j 'stringy bark' runs easily lip to more
than Â«00 feet high." He completely
squelched me by adding casually: "The
big trees grow mostly in valleys there.
No one takes any particular notice of
them." v-- k 
- It was while talking of the Aus
tralian trees â "stringy bark," Iron bark,
"llmltle/s" cedarâ "of no commercial
use from lack of railroads," that I dis
covered Mr. Bellew in another enthu
siasm, lhe elephant woodchoppers of
Rangoon. He described eloquently how
the elephants carried great trees to the
sawmill, saw that they were cut Into
the proper length, dragged the blocks
to their resting place, piling them at
last into heaps with mathematical ac
curacy. He told how one old elephant â
"the old lady"â teaches the whole thing
to the recruits in six weeks, and how
every elephant of them learns to leave
everything he is doing when the whistle
blows with .the promptitude of a union
carpenter!
"I cannot imagine how in the world
you came to be an actor," I blurted out
then. "Living so much among . real
things" 7.
Myself, I'd be pleased enough to take
the gate money. I won't % spoil the
story by Mr. Bellew's later protest
concerning Shaw's sincerity. He .could
not do better: "Shaw's -QUAINT!"
We returned then to Mrs. Potter,
and Mr. Bellew put it that "God broke
the mold when he made her." He
argued that the actress had succeeded
by being "just her own extraordinary
self"; spoke of her Â¦ red Â¦Â¦ hairâ not
"imitation," as the Orpheum punster
put it, like another famous red-haired
actress;' characterized her as "more of
a classical actress"- than any other
type, and spoke of her recent Calypso.
"Truly," I inquired, "wouldn't you
rather be playing the repertoire you
played with Mrs. Potter thanâ Raffles,
for example?"
â¢"Why?" said the actor with a shrug.
"Raffles is an easy thing. It's popular.
After all it's the commercial side that
counts. I have only to put on an
evening coat, take a cigar, walk en
the stage, . and \ walk off - again, and
then forget all about It until the next
time. Why should one bother to be a
Hamlet, nerves strung up all night, In
bed all day, or dead beat? I've done
all that; I've been through it all, and
jolly hard it is."
"Mr. Bellew," I said sternly, "you're
acting!"
, "Perhaps I am," he laughed. "But
there, if one were to . play the 1 things
he preferred he would almost always
have to play them to empty benches."
Perhaps . "Hamlet" had recalled the
Haymarket, for the actor began then
to talk of his Haymarket days, in- J.
B. Buckstone's time, , when' the oldest
actor there had been 42 years with the
house, the stage manager. 3S, the
"youngest" member next to Mr.; Bellew
17! . "Those were the days," recalled
the actor, "when we had to look In
The Dally Telegraph every morning to
see what we were" going to' play at
night! A fact, I assure you. '.Arid we
had to report one hour, before 'the, per
formance for fear the bill was changed.
And we frequently changed the ' bill
every night. Actors don't have to
work to-day! We used to be engaged
for one line of work"â Mr. Bellew
lazily slapped a knee to emphasize the
following â "and we were expected to
know every part in that line in the
legitimate drama." .
"Then do you feel that the stage has
degenerated?"
" 'Palmy days,' and that sort of
thing?" queried the actor. "Not at all,
I remember old Bucky on 'palmy
days,' " he laughed. "Bucky used to
grunt: 'Palmy days, palmy days,"
years ago,' sir! No, sir! "The only
'palmy days' I remember were when
the beggars got drunk and never knew
their lines'-rdear old Bucky!" . \
It was after this when Mr. Bellew
said that Charles Fechter's was tha
best Hamlet he knew, that I mentioned
the Hamlets outside. It was then I
had the honor of Mr. Bellew'a. escort
down Kearny street. And it was then
I got a peep at the gentle Romeo. Just
by the peanut stand we said "good
by"âalas! But was it wittingly that
Romeo held my hand a tender trifle
longer than need be, as he asked "if
I were not going to say very nice
things about him on Sunday?"
And the amateur Juliet replied,
turning up her eyes to him, "How
COULD I say anything else!"
There waj a young actor named Kyrle â '
â¢ Permit mÂ« thiÂ« rhs-me to unfyrle.
To explain hero and early
Thai to call the man Kyr-le
Sets bis cherubic temper a-whjrrle.
Of course the rest of the name is
Boiler. Harold Kyrle Belles, to be
particular. Mr. Bellew kindly con
sented to be the victim of the week's
chat. "Youngr?" did you say? Of course
be is young. When did you ever see
a Romeo that was not young? And
Where and when did you ever see a
Romeo like unto this one?
And to think of itâ peace, fluttering
heart! Of course I met a dozen, a score,
a hundred people I knew â afterward.
But to think I did not see (andante
patetico) â I mean be seen by â even
a cat that knew roe as I walked down
Kearny 6treet with Kyrle Bellew!
Heigh ho: Well, why shouldn't I sigh?
Is it every day a girl gets the chance
to walk three whole blocks and a half
end bagkâ barring the half, I WILL, be
honestâ with Borneo? It happened this
way. The unearthly hour of 10 o'clock
last Tuesday morning was 'set for our
chat. The California Hotel was the
place. The unearthly hour of 10 of
the dock was also set for the Knights
Templar parade. I had seen gay, ex
citing btts of pageantry on my Tray
fiewn, velvet cloaked Sir Knights,
splendid priests, blade, shining, pranc
ing steed*, tfr* wave of glorious ban
ners, the morning sxm glinting on a
rword, or turning the gold and silver
trappings Into a rich, ordered dazzle,
and the rest of it I had heard the
tcarm hum of the crowds, the gay
ehrlek of the siren, glittering snatches
of holiday music, tne wine of the
morning in it alL I hope I did my duty
by the Interviewâ Mr. Bellew*s fascin
ations ** a raconteur actively assist
ing, but I wanted to see the parade.
At last, when the thrill at the drums
at the foot of the street got too much
for me, I said: "You should see the
procession, Mr. Bellew, hundreds of
Hamlets on horseback."
"Then surelyâ" with the most blase
of the Bellew aire, "I do not want to
eee it. I have seen many more Ham
lets than I wished to already. But â "
But when I left a moment later Mr.
Bellew put on his hat and came down
the street with me. It -was comically
with the air of the grave adult that
takes the child to the circus.
This was all afterward, however. Nor
Hamlet nor Romeoâ except when, well,
that laterâ I had found Mr. Bellew.
Perhaps It was because we began by
talking of Australia. Then, like Desde
mona, I sat listening to an Othello.
There was no trace then of the Raf
flts-like boredom that later cropped out
â when the actor talked of his art, of
Raffles and other unimportances. In
rapid and pointful phrase he told the
story of his Queensland experiences,
illustrating with -quick, picturesque
gesture. The brown eyes under the
"bad boy" fringe of white hair flashed.
Th,e voice warmed to the tale. Now
and then a curious bellboy looked into
the room â the red velveted reception
rcom â but went unheeded.
It should perhaps be preluded that
the Bellew gold mines are in Northern
Queensland. Everybody knows, of
course, that the actor owns other gold
mines than "Raffles." It may also be
reminded that for his Australian geo
graphical research Mr. Bellew counts
en F. R. G. S. after his name, not to
mention an F. R. M. S.
The actor at first told the story of
how he came to be a gold mine owner
â 'twouldn't be of any use to you, the
usual Olympian luck â or I would tell it.
and then Mr. Bellew began to talk of
the Queenslander in his blackest va
riety. I had asked him if they em
ployed the native aborigine in the
mines when he told me that with 1200
men only in Australia they had taken
out more gold last year than either
America or South Africa. He was ex
plaining why the native was not em
ployed.
"We had to kill five of 'em In our
camp," he was saying, quietly as one
might talk of killing fleas. "He's a
cross begg-ar, utterly hopeless. There
was a lot of bother with them that
year. Got wild. The Government
stopped our using 'em. We used to get
them to find our horses In the bush
end such likeâ they're magnificent
bushmen â and gave them tobacco i-nd
â¢tuff for it. Then when they couldn't
get things that way they robbed the
camp â poor brutesâ and otherwise got
dangerous. So we had to shoot them."
Remember this* is an actor, a society
comedian at the present moment, talk
ing.
"Blacks?" In answer to my question.
â¢"Black! They're black with a black
ness you've never seen before on a hu
man skin. And he's an ugly beggar,
too, nostrils and mouth all over his
face." Mr. Bellew tried to spread his
Â¦without much success. "But get him
behind a spear!â I don't know that
there is anything I like to see better â
when he's turned the other way."
"He Isn't always?" I suggested,
breathless.
"Net always," Mr. Bellew smiled.
â¢â¢Clever beggar! It's beautiful, you
know. His spear Is a great, long thing
â Â«.s long as that door to the table here
ten feet, perhaps â headed with an ar
row-like point of Iron bark, the whole
top of the spear decorated with hooks
something like a fish bone. Can't drag
It back when it gets In, you knowâ it
has to come out on the other side."
"It has!" I gasped.
He added: "And every point is pois
oned."
He added again: "When you see a
native coming your way, stoopâ erâ
â¢you shoot."
"You did"
"I did."
Then In vivid pantomime he sketched
the tall, lithe black, gliding through the
long grass, apparently friendly, ap
parently unarmed, but with his poison
ed epear gripped between his treacher
ous toes. He told of the warfare when
Greek meets Greek. Of how the one
Epeared at never tries to get out of the
way, but with the ingenious lever by
which he projects his own spear, turns
the ether aside. He told also of the
native boomerang magic and other
fighting gear and incident.
"And tht-se are little scenes of daily
life in Queensland."
I commented. "How is the country?"
"Very beautiful in the north," the
actor said. "Sky a magnificent blueâ
the climate is dry like it is hereâ good
mountains, splendid trees."
"We have a tree or two here," I be
gnn.
"Those are larger." Faid the Fellow

Many questions arose when its cour

was: Are women clubable in the sense

course there are loads of women who
possess the companionship! spiritâ who
are big and broad enough to grasp the
best in mutual fellowship, which is
bound to be of benefit to both men
and women.
, The directors, with , the president,
Charles Sedgwick Aiken, have been
wise in their age and generation by
securing downtown \ rooms, where the
drop-in habit may be sanely cultivated.
Ah! But will the menâ the men that
stand for the bone and sinew of the
constitution, the women, the flesh and
the frillsâ find the rooms as livable
as their own - clubrooms? But away
with conjecture! To be sure they will

have in New .York and in London.
And the rooms? Snug and comfy on
the mc-zzanine floor of the St.' Francis,
Gearj- street side, with fine windows
facing: the rising sun â luck/ omen.
Refreshments? To be sure. Tea, and
other harmless things.
The main' room is admirably fitted
for cards, tete-a-tetes and other things,
with attractive walls and drapes, and
without is the balcony whence music
grows; likewise for big events are two
beautiful reception rooms at the club's
disposal, with dressing-roomsâ and
powder puffs.

LONDON, Sept. 10.â Colonel Colomb,
the retired officer of the Royal Ar
tillery, is well known In London society
for two reasons. He is a descendant
of Christopher Columbus, the discov
erer of America, and also, perhaps,
the greatest friend possessed by the
birds of the metropolis. At all smart
social functions he is an invited guest;
to all traveling Americans he Is point
ed out when they go to the park to
see the world of fashion. But it Is not
along the Ladies' Mile thr t!iey seek
for Colonel Colomb, nor is he seen rid
ing 'in the Row, but 'a little further
down toward Kensington Gardens.
There every morning, wet or fine, when
in town, the colonel may be r.een sur
rounded by birds, wb/stling to some,
talking to others and feeding them all.
Each and every sparrow knows his
name and will perch upon the colonel' a
head and shoulders, eat out of his
hand and fly far to welcome him on
his approach.
So great a lover of birds is Colonel
'Colomb that the most important of
social functions is not allowed to de
prive him of the pleasure of feeding his
pets. When he goes away traveling
provision is always made for his little
pensioners, and once when called away
from London suddenly he inserted in
the Morning Post an appeal to "bird
lovers," requesting them to "please
fee'd my birds in the park during my
unavoidable absence." At Monte Carlo,
which he frequently visits, Colonel Co
lomb is also a figure of prominence, for
there he has captured the affections
of the flock of pigeons by feeding and
petting them. When surrounded by
these birds he Is an object of great in
terest to amateur photographers, par
ticularly ladles.
It is from a collateral branch of
Christopher Columbus' family that
Colonel Colomb Is descended. In ap
pearance he Is tall and military look-
Ing, his HghJ hair Just flecked with
gray. Although now retired from tha
army, he Is exceedingly energetic. He
is esteemed as a fine French scholar
and has written an abridged English
version in rhyme of Mollere's "Femmes
Savantes." The family seat of the
Colombs Is Dromquinna in County
Kerry, Ireland. Colonel Colomb la a
brother of Sir John Colomb, M. P.. a
naval officer who is well known 'as
a writer on imperial defense.
This great bird lover has many In
teresting little stories to tell about
his pets. He declares that society has
much tc learn from the birds, who-, he
declares, would never be guilty of tak
ing- any Tom. Dick or Harry into their
different sets and becoming so hope
lessly mixed as London society now is.
They maintain their little cliques with
great dignity, he says. For Instance
the birds of aristocratic Hyde Park

Now, while every one sympathizes
with this high-spirited American girl
in her misfortune there is much in
her case that may save other girls
from similar pain. And the primary
lesson in it is: Don't wed on sight.
The secondary lesson is: Don't sail
under false colors. If you are heiress
to ten thousand, don't give out the
impression that the sum is ten mil
lion, because if you do some fortune
hunter who knows the same trick may
trap you at your own game â then ex

spirits, give visual evidence of It, that
others may borrow from your store, for
this is the true crusade depres
sion and despairâ despots that at this
very hour are stalking about among
the maids and matrons of the smart set
as never before. Hence comes anima
tion as a needed antidote.
The sods be thankedâ the "frappe
face" Is no longer good form! Maids
and matrons, if you feel a Joy in your
heart, pray give it rein. If you are
thrilled or appalled at the play, at the
races, anywhere, fear not that it is
bourgeoise to let year face tell the tale
as well as your voice. The day of the
"bored air" is goneâ and it died by its
own hand. Bearing an air of discontent
and unsatisfied longing, by the law of
sympathetic action, it bred Just those
morbid conditions. And the world
knows what morbid broodlngs bring
so do nerve specialists, they who of all
medical practitioners are to-day the
busiest. And the frappeâ the frozen
faceâ has played its part in the havoc.
Just when the frozen or the bored
expression became good form is hard
to discover, but thera are those who
believe It to be the unique discovery
of genius; for all of us know men and
women who write or paint or compose
more or less successfully who bear this
air, *s if tne commonplace palled on
their gentle spirits, causing pain â when
as a matter of fact the pain is all on
the other side. Now, this bored air is
simply a pose, and poses are distinctly
passe In good society.
If men or women are big, either in
character or achievement, no pose is
necessary to emphasize the fact. If
they are ordinary mortals that com
pose the bulk of humanity then a pose
is insufferable. Naturalness is the key
note of conduct to-dayâ in the drawing
room as in the studio^ Pose is a lie,
and living a lie is a useless expenditure
at energy. By cultivating kindly, con
siderate, courteous thoughts, manners
will come in good time, and then let the
heart and the head be the guides of
conduct with the face its index. Staid
stolidity is no longer an earmark of
pood breeding any more than is its op
posite â unseemly hilarity.

As an experiment in clubdom, the
Sequoia possesses a unique interest.
Many questions arose when its cour
ageous and clever founder. Miss Ednah
Robinson, set out to create it. One
was: Are women clubable in the sense
that men are clubable? The second:
What will be the outcome of such free
commingling' of men and women on
neutral ground? Such nonsense! 'Of
course there are loads of women who
possess the companionship! spiritâ who
are big and broad enough to grasp the
best in mutual fellowship, which is
bound to be of benefit to both men
and women.
, The directors, with , the president,
Charles Sedgwick Aiken, have been
wise in their age and generation by
securing downtown \ rooms, where the
drop-in habit may be sanely cultivated.
Ah! But will the menâ the men that
stand for the bone and sinew of the
constitution, the women, the flesh and
the frillsâ find the rooms as livable
as their own - clubrooms? But away
with conjecture! To be sure they will
âthe right type of menâ even as th;/
have in New .York and in London.
And the rooms? Snug and comfy on
the mc-zzanine floor of the St.' Francis,
Gearj- street side, with fine windows
facing: the rising sun â luck/ omen.
Refreshments? To be sure. Tea, and
other harmless things.
The main' room is admirably fitted
for cards, tete-a-tetes and other things,
with attractive walls and drapes, and
without is the balcony whence music
grows; likewise for big events are two
beautiful reception rooms at the club's
disposal, with dressing-roomsâ and
powder puffs.
On the 15tn will this new home be

LONDON, Sept. 10.â Colonel Colomb,
the retired officer of the Royal Ar
tillery, is well known In London society
for two reasons. He is a descendant
of Christopher Columbus, the discov
erer of America, and also, perhaps,
the greatest friend possessed by the
birds of the metropolis. At all smart
social functions he is an invited guest;
to all traveling Americans he Is point
ed out when they go to the park to
see the world of fashion. But it Is not
along the Ladies' Mile thr t!iey seek
for Colonel Colomb, nor is he seen rid
ing 'in the Row, but 'a little further
down toward Kensington Gardens.
There every morning, wet or fine, when
in town, the colonel may be r.een sur
rounded by birds, wb/stling to some,
talking to others and feeding them all.
Each and every sparrow knows his
name and will perch upon the colonel' a
head and shoulders, eat out of his
hand and fly far to welcome him on
his approach.
So great a lover of birds is Colonel
'Colomb that the most important of
social functions is not allowed to de
prive him of the pleasure of feeding his
pets. When he goes away traveling
provision is always made for his little
pensioners, and once when called away
from London suddenly he inserted in
the Morning Post an appeal to "bird
lovers," requesting them to "please
fee'd my birds in the park during my
unavoidable absence." At Monte Carlo,
which he frequently visits, Colonel Co
lomb is also a figure of prominence, for
there he has captured the affections
of the flock of pigeons by feeding and
petting them. When surrounded by
these birds he Is an object of great in
terest to amateur photographers, par
ticularly ladles.
It is from a collateral branch of
Christopher Columbus' family that
Colonel Colomb Is descended. In ap
pearance he Is tall and military look-
Ing, his HghJ hair Just flecked with
gray. Although now retired from tha
army, he Is exceedingly energetic. He
is esteemed as a fine French scholar
and has written an abridged English
version in rhyme of Mollere's "Femmes
Savantes." The family seat of the
Colombs Is Dromquinna in County
Kerry, Ireland. Colonel Colomb la a
brother of Sir John Colomb, M. P.. a
naval officer who is well known 'as
a writer on imperial defense.
This great bird lover has many In
teresting little stories to tell about
his pets. He declares that society has
much tc learn from the birds, who-, he
declares, would never be guilty of tak
ing- any Tom. Dick or Harry into their
different sets and becoming so hope
lessly mixed as London society now is.
They maintain their little cliques with
great dignity, he says. For Instance
the birds of aristocratic Hyde Park
F will not. associate with the feathered
denizens of the more plebeian Batter-.
sea Park. muMMmE,.-

Then it was that a large part of the
wedding gifts had to be sold for
passage money, and on their return
to this city that the same expedient
was resorted to for transportation
East.
Now, while every one sympathizes
with this high-spirited American girl
in her misfortune there is much in
her case that may save other girls
from similar pain. And the primary
lesson in it is: Don't wed on sight.
The secondary lesson is: Don't sail
under false colors. If you are heiress
to ten thousand, don't give out the
impression that the sum is ten mil
lion, because if you do some fortune
hunter who knows the same trick may
trap you at your own game â then ex

Newport that 'tis bad form to wear the

Queen Victoria made Doris a. maid of!

LONDON, Sept. 10â It is possible that
Andrew Carnegie may come before the
public soon In a new roleâ tha't of tem
perance reformer. Already, he is doing
a lot in a quiet way toward the sup
port of the temperance organizations
in this country. Although he could not
see eye to eye with his friend, the late
Cardinal Manning, as concerned reli
gious questions, Carnegie had the
greatest admiration for the Cardinal's
work as a democratic thinker and an
apostle of temperance. It is not gen
erally known the Laird of Skibo was
one of the strongest supporters t that
Manning had In connection with the
temperance movement he initiated
among the members of the Roman
Catholic community in England. A
check for a substantial amount was
always forthcoming when the work of
the Cardinal wanted extending. Car
negie admits that Manning was the
first man to impress him deeply with
the advantages of strict abstinence
from alcohol. It is a common saying
of his now that one Â¦ sober man ' is
worth a whole world of drunkards. He
is a generous contributor to all the
leading temperance organizations In
the country, regardless of creed . or
class.- Lady HÂ«nry Somerset's work
of founding homes for inebriate women
is at the moment the special object of
his attention in this direction. He is
not, however, an intolerant temper
ance advocate. Visitors or guests at
Skibo can have anything they want in
the way of drink, but servants are en
couraged to have money In lieu ot
beer. To the .men working about the
castle grounds and his golf links he is
continually holding up fhe 'American
workman aa an example of sobriety.
He had occasion a short time ago to
remonstrate with one of his men for
unsteadiness, but finding that the case
was hopeless, he asked him if he would
go to the United States instead of tak
ing his discharge. The man chose the
former alternative. "Wise for once,",'
said jCarnegie, "they'll sober you over
there."
Laird of Skibo Says Tliat Cardinal
Manning Taught Him Value of
From Alcohol.

A short time since Captain Moore
was re-elected to command Company

who is out, but wants to get in again.
Target practice by the National
Guard, so far as the Second Brigade
is concerned.- has this year been neg
lected. Only batteries of the First
Artillery and some companies of the
Fifth Infantry have, during the cur
rent year, gone before the butts and
that was only at their own expense in
order to become used to the new
rifles.
Elections will soon be ordered for
colonel of the First Infantry, vice'T.
F. O'Neil. and for lieutenant colonel,
vice J. F. Connelly, whose terms will
soon expire. In the same regiment
other elections will be called in a few
days to Jill vacancies to be caused by
expiration of commissions. These are:
For captain of Company A, vice
Georjje T. Eallinger; captain of Com

first lieutenant of the same company,

The several organizations of the
National Guard located in. this city

Foxhall Keene could earn a fortune in
England at the present time as an

King Edward his first lesson in guid

fashionable people â English as well as
American â who have taken up the mo

seeking driving lessens. Resu!t,[some
soreness on the part of English profes

As this department has not a roster of
the ages of those who are "Thirty-sec
ond degree Masons, Knights Templar
and Mystic Shriners In the United
States," It Is Impossible to name who
Is the youngest Should some one set
up the claim this department 'would
not publish his name, for the reason
that from every section of the country
would come claims to controvert the
assertion. It would be the same' as
to who Is the oldest Mason and the
oldest Odd Fellow.
TT seems that some of the officials at the Immigration Bureau in
I Washington have lately voiced their alarm at the imminence of
an utter extinction of the American of simon-pure stock. Reports
quote them as making the declaration that in New England espe
cially the influx of foreigners and race suicide among the old fam
ilies have combined to make the homely names of Smith, Adams and
Green memories only. Soon we will look upon the last remnant of
the Puritan race with the touching sympathy we now bestow upon
the unwashed Indian, whose toes are crimped over the western edge
of the continent that was once his.
Whether this plaintive note arises through the baneful influence
of the dog days in Washington or is merely indicative of a dis
ordered digestion, the press dispatches say. not; only that the good
old squire up Woonsocket way who used to buy three cents' worth
of fishhooks and two pennorth of rum at the Corners has passed
His haunts are now become the rendezvous of the Slovak and the
Hun. Vacant is his favorite soap box at Hank Peters' general
store, empty the brownstonc jug with the corncob stopple.
Impossible of conception is the effect, manifold in its influences
that must arise from the passing of Squire Dogberry. In the realm
of art alone the revolution will be sweeping. Imagine having to pro
vide future generations of playgoers with a handbook to elucidate the
intricacies of "Way Down East" and "The, Old Homestead." Con
sider the archaic niche "David Harum" and "Eben Holden" will
occupy in the coming temple of letters. In our museums the patch
work quilt and the rag carpet will share the same glass case with the
cowhide boot and the home-made suspendersâ sad relics of the Ar
cadian age that is gone.

Answers.
AFTER careful investigations of a year's duration a committee
of experts from the Chicago School Board has reported that
of all the school children in that city one in three is afllicted
with some disorder of the nerves. To account for this alarming lack
of health among the city's young folk the committee assigns as
causes the incessant noises of a great metropolis, the lack of pure
air and the general strain attendant upon the unnatural conditions of
city life.
These findings of the Chicago authorities emphasize the gravity
of a question that has forced itself on the attention of thinkers in
recent years. It has been maintained that the influences of city life
so far disturb the normal scheme of living as, to have direct effect
upon the mentality and bodily health of the second generation of
urban dwellers. It has been agreed among students of social eco
nomics that unless a distinct modification of type comes to aller
viate the strain of the intense life in cities, great harm must result,
not only for the especial class directly affected, but in reflected
measure for the race.
Of all the curative measures adopted by far-sighted humanists
for the relief of this city strain the New York idea of roof play
grcuhds for schools seems the most practical and the one givin^
promise of best results. There, in many of the downtown schools
where the congested condition of the tenement quarter allows of no
breathing space for children, a roof cage, equipped with every fa
cility for athletic games, gives place for all pupils to indulge in exer
cise denied them by home surroundings. This scheme, with the
supplementary aid of the children's playground, has already done
much in the direction of making healthy "the life of the city child.
THE CITY STRAIN ON CHILDREN.
Lady Jane has a cousin who bears
the same name. She Is the j youthful
daughter of the Rev. Lord Victor Sey
mour, a South Kensington vicar, who
was born the fourth son of the late
Marquis. It may thus be anticipated
that yet another register will see the
bridal signature of an always historic
name.
And thus It comes about that while
In Ragley House the present Marquis
of Hertford possesses what Is emphat
ically . one of the "stately homes of
England," his Income Is entirely inade
quate to its proper maintenance. It
was this impoverishment of the family"
exchequer which drove his heir, Lord
Yarmouthâ Lady Jane's brother â to
America for a bride. There It will be
remembered he * married Miss Alice
Thaw of Pittsburg.
To Ireland he went and "did the
popular," and in due time was reward
ed with the coveted garter. It Is said
that on the occasion of his visit to
Ireland he went out riding in the
neighborhood of Lisburne, and on
reaching the top of a hill his com
panion said to him, "Now, my Lord,
as far as you can see all is your own."
To which Lord Hertford replied, "Well,
I see it for the first time, and I hope
I shall never see it again." Nor v did
he.
By the law of entail. his English es
tates of Ragley and Sudburne passed
to his cousin, and intimate personal
friend of the Prince Consort. But he
had taken a great dislike to all of his
relatives and left them nothing that
he could help. He is credited with
having said that his chief regret at
dying was that It would prevent him
seeing their faces when his will was
read. The fifth Marquis of Hertford
seems to have been animated by some
what similar feelings toward his rela
tives, for he left all that he could con
trol by will to his friend, Richard Wal
lace, who was subsequently created a
Baronet.

Â¦ ONDON, Aug. 20.â Apart from Its
I social Importance the marriage
L which has Just taken place be-
Lady Jane Seymour, young
est daughter of the Marquis and
Marchioness of Hertford, and Major
Hugh Dudley Carleton, is of unusual
interest because of the historic memo
ries that are associated with the name
of the bride and the romantic history
of her family.
She is the third of her family to take
that font name to the altar. The first
was "the right noble, virtuous and ex
cellent lady, of convenient years and
excellent beauty" who, in 1536, became
the wife of that much married mon
arch. King Henry VIIL The day after
the marriage took place another of his
wives, the ill-fated Anne Boleyn; was
executed* in the Tower. Jane Seymour
was the only one of the six -for whom
he is to have entertained any real
affection and respect. She did not live
loni; enough to, give him time to out
grow it, dying the year following her
marriage and twelve days after the
birth of her son, who subsequently be
came King Edward VL Only once
did she sicra her name as "Jane the
Queen." That was on the day of her
son's birth, when the . customary an
nouncement was made to the Privy
Council. King Henry VIII paid her
the compliment of donning 'mourning
for her, a. tribute -which he did' not pay
to the memory of any of the- other
four whom he survived. Afterhls
death he shared the same grave, with
her in St. George's Chapel.- .'
This Lady Jane's marriage was the
making of her family./ Her eldest
brother, Edward, was successively cre
ated Viscount Beauchamp,- Earl of
Hertford and Duke of Somerset,' and
as Protector played a leading part in
the first half of the reign of Edward
VI. Another brother, , Thomas, was

HISTORIC MEMORIES RECALLED BY
MARRIAGE OF LADY JANE SEYMOUR
(COPYRIGHT, 1904. BT SPECIAL ARRANG EMEKT WITH THE SdX FRANCISCO CALL AND THE NEW YORK EVENING MAIL.)
WE publish the letter of Mr. Sterling on the use of fire in
forest preservation with pleasure, as expressing the views
of a trained and able and scientific forester. * The con
servative use of fire to prevent its destructive effects is a question
that reasonably has two sides. The renewal of the forests, to make
them permanently potential in all their varied uses as the providers
of lumber and timber and conservators of moisture, is the decisive
element in the controversy. Our forests came to us from the
Indian?, who made use of fire, conservatively, to clear the forest
floor. But the' evidence is not complete, that . thehy use of that
sgent prevented renewal, since the forests, as we received th.em
from the aborigines, had trees of all kinds and all ages and stages
of growth. It is settled at the outset that if fire, used to prevent
the spread of destructive forest conflagrations, is found to prevent
a renewal, and that effect cannot be provided against, then fire
should be excluded. But when that is done have we made s'ecure
the reproduction of the forests, and especially of the coniferous
trees ?
Mr. Sterling refers to the clearing of the floor of the Mariposa
grove of big trees. It is true that it is a pleasure forest and may
be treated differently from a commercial forest whose permanency
is desirable. But what appeared in the Mariposa grove may prop
erly apply to commercial forests of coniferous trees. For thirty
years the duff had accumulated on the floor of that big tree grove.
The annual fall of needles and of the deciduous trees and under
scrub had made a covering in many places several feet in depth.
It was a dangerous conveyor of fire, as was discovered in i88q.
The fire would run tinder this duff for hundreds of feet. It was
almost like a layer of pitch and tinder. The commission in charge
of the grove, after that experience, cleared and burned the duff
tinder all the big trees and from most of the whole reservation.
Then appeared the agency of the duff in preventing reproduction
as effectually as an annual fire can do it.
There had long been raised the lamentations of botanists and
<r!endro!ogists that the big trees had lost the power of reproduction.
True, they bore cones and these had seeds, but there were no
young trees springing from the germs. But within a few years
after the doff was cleared and burned and the ground exposed
thereby, under every cone bearing big tree' there. were thousands
of young trees sprouted from the seed. It then appeared that
Tir.jcss the seeds of forest trees reach the ground they do iiot
sprout, and if they fall in a thick coating of the dry duff they fail
to germinate.
From this it may well be argued that in California, where we
have the definite wet and dry seasons, unless by some means the
forest floor is cleared and the tree seeds permitted to reach the
ground there will be no reproduction of forests, except by artificial
planting. Of course this condition is special to a country of wet
nnd long dry seasons, where the decay of the duff into leaf mold is
slow and does not affect the top of the mass which prevents
the contact of the seed with its natural matrix.
We remain of the conviction that our forests will always be
exposed to destructive fires unless some means be taken to clear
the floor at a proper season. Here the office of the forest floor of
fallen leaves is fulfilled when the rains have ceased for- a time.
The duff has held the moisture for slow percolation into the soil
and has restrained evaporation. Its duty is done and it may be
cleared away to be succeeded by another season's deposit of the
same material to' discharge the same function.
Without pretending to any knowledge of the subject other
than that which is based on observation, we venture to suggest that
there may be reasons why forests in a climate like this should be
treated differently from those in a country of continuing moisture.
It is fortunate that the country is getting a corps of trained
foresters like Mr. Sterling, whose very training makes a habit of
that open mind with which science approaches all of the problems
of nature
FOREST PRESERVATION.
The great commercial forests of th?
State cannot possibly be held as mere
parks, but must be exploited, though if
possible with a view of continuous
yield, and this Is possible only by keep-
Ing out the fires which destroy the re
production.
I shall be very glad to give you mat
ter for publication on the work we are
doing In the forests of the State, and
you can do much to swing public" senti
ment in the right direction, but I hard
ly think It fair to advocate methods
whfch professional foresters universally
agree are very harmful to the best
present and future Interests of the
State forests. E. A. STERLING.
Young growth for at least the- first
ten years of its existence will be de
stroyed by even the lightest ground
flre. For one result of the old Indian
practice look at the great burns in the
bases of many of the finest sugar and
yellow pines and at the great areas of
chaparral around Lake Tahoe. in the
Shasta country and through the higher
Sierras generally. True, the Indian left
us the forests, but how much finer they
would have been if not thinned, scarred
and broken by the Indians* fires.
â¢ Professional foresters, neither in this
country or abroad, have never advocated
burning the virgin forest or the thick
ets of young growth, but. on the con
trary, have found such fires the great
est bar to scientific forest management.
The only burning advisable is In
clearing up the debris left after lum
bering. Fire is not used at all In the
European forests save In the most lim
ited way in burning brush, which te
carefully piled. Instead a patrol sys
tem, backed by telephones and a more
favorable public sentiment, such as we
are trying to get here, is used In pre
venting fire.
The case of the Mariposa big tree
grove cited Is quite apart from general
forest flre protection. It Is not an eco
nomic problem in that case, but purely
sentimental, and the aim merely pro
tection of a wonderful grove. There is
no need or desire for reproduction
there, and the area Is small enough
so that it is practicable to use fire in
clearing up the ground. It Is, in short,
a "luxury forest." 4'h ile the main prob
lem Is with the "commercial forest.**
UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT
OF AGRICULTURE. BUREAU OP
FORESTRY. SACRAMENTO. Sept. 2.
1904.â Editor The Call: I noticed In this
morning's Issue of The Call your edito
rial on forest preservation, which I In
fer was Inspired by my letter jn answer
to Mr. Ostrander's suggestions for fire
protection published August 29.
Nothing: la farther from my desire
than to seem prejudiced or antagonistic
In any way. but I do want to call your
attention to the Injury which may re
sult from such a general burning of
the forests as you suggest.
I will preface by way of explanation
by saying that I graduated from a for
estry college In this country and have
studied the subject extensively abroad,
and speak not as a woodsman or ama
teur. Moreover. I have been officially
engaged In studying the fire problem In
California for about a year, and have
traveled through all of the forested re
gions of the State.
To elaborate on the technical objec
tions to the Indian practice of firing
the woods Is uncalled for here. In brief
the results of such a plan would be: (1)
Destruction of all reproduction and a
gradual thinning of the forest by the
repeated burning out of the large trees
at the base: (2) disappearance of the
humus and litter, which is needed to
conserve moisture and enrich the soil;
(3) exposure of the mineral soil to
leaching and evasion: (4) ascendancy
of worthless brush over large areas
now under forest cover.

NORMAL SCHOOL MAKES THE SUCCESSFUL TEACHER
THE REIGN OF THE NEW WOMAN COMES TO AN END
By Kate Thyson Marr
The Los Angeles_Normal_was â¢ or^
ganlzed twenty years later than the
San Jose school, in 1882. This met a
great want of the southern portion of
the State, and its^influence on the pub
lic school system ;-* has been corre
spondingly large.. The school grounds

gymnasium has long been a favorite

this school has the. only State depart
ment for the training, of kindergarten

ence, and', a'rt, is In operation. It is re
markable;that 9S per cent of the 1500
graduates have taught!. Jesse F. Mllls

Minnesota, assumes the presidency of

modern educational studies and prob
lems. Manual training, drawing and
music receive due attention. " The 11
brafy has 8,000 volumes. Not long ago
the standard of admission was -so
raised .as to require the applicant to
possess a high school education or its
equivalent. A summer school has
been maintained for - two years with
Increasing success. . Morris E. Dalley
is the president.' . /
An indispensable department In all
normal schools is what Is known as a
training school. It is composed of
children ,of all grades. from the first
to the' ninth. They are taught by the
student teachers of the normal de
partment, whose work is constantly
under, the close supervision of the fac
ulty. The new and Interesting meth
ods employed, combined with the
thoroughness of the joint teaching,
have given these training schools such
high rank as to make them popular
among discriminating parents. To the
student teacher this experience is of
the utmost importance, enabling her
to discover and correct mistakes un
der the counsel of able supervisors, to
gain knowledge of child life and to
accurately measure'.' her. own., powers
before assuming permanent charge of
a school. The underlying' idea of this
work is that "practice makes perfect.",
, In point of age the San f Jose . Nor
mal is the mpther of all, having been
organized In San Francisco in\'1863
and removed to San Jose in' 1871. Its
record for thirty-six years .-is closely
Interwoven with the Â«ducajional, de
velopment of the State,; (or /-In every
one pf its" counties .some; ofathe 3500
graduates have become a", part- of, its
being and strong factors, iriritsf social
life. The course' of study, is 'Â¦". broad,
covering English, mathematics, his-
dice and suspicion and in many cases
persistent opposition. Steadily, year
by year, the schools won their way to
popular favor and support till at the
present time they are maintained in
nearly every portion of the ynited
States, not excepting Porto Rico and
the Philippines, where at Rio Piedras
and Manila, respectively, strong work
Is being accomplished in the training
of native teachers. Every State save
two j has established normal schools
and "in these two teachers are taught
in - the State colleges. Including the
private Institutions there are now
nearly 300 normal schools in the
country.
California maintains five normal
schools. These have been placed In
locations throughout the State where
they will be the most accessible to
their attending students. Tuition ia
free and the only school expenses are
a few of nominal amount. Applicants
for admission are required to sign a
declaration that his or her purpose is
to secure preparation for teaching
with the Intention to teach in the
public schools of California. The total
annual appropriations by the State for
the five schools exceeds $200,000. The
whole number of graduates from
these five schools since their founding
at different periods is nearly 6000,. of
which a large percentage is in active
service.
IF the hope of the nation is in its
public schools, it is of supreme im
jjurtance that their teachers should
be thoroughly trained. No State
i an afford to allow its teachers to
."cqrtire their knowledge of the art of
teaching by painfully slow progress
rlong the path of experience. They
thould enter ur>on their duties only
jifter thorough preparation. In the
three score years just passed no
r.gency has been found so effective for
this purpose as the normal school.
The f.rrt normal school in the
United States for the sj-stematic in
struction of teachers was established
in Lexington, Mass., in 1839. Intense
opposition was shown toward this
innovation in school life, for it was
Ftoutly contended by many of the wise
ones of that day that "good teachers
Â¦were born and not made." Through
the influence of Horace Mann and
other leading educators a gift of $10.-
OC0 was secured from a private source
upon the condition that the State of
Massachusetts should appropriate an
e'jual sum.
This . was done, the school was
opened and was followed by two
other normals in the same State. The
hostility encountered in the first agi
tation of the project for special educa
tion of teachers continued for some
years and the early graduates of the
three schools everywhere faced preju-
the presidents of all the normals and a
few others. It is gratifying to record
an Increasing tendency to hearty co
operation among these authorities.
Locally the schools must differ with
the diverse environments. Broadly they
may unite in measures for the highest
interests of the State as a whole.
Among other subjects discussed with
t* /ughtful attention in late years no
one has received more care than the
determination of the standards of ad
mission to the several schools.
There is ample reason for congrratu
latlon that the old days when formal
and mechanical methods of Instruction
were esteemed are passing away.. It is
alreadv recognized in the teaching
world that a real teacher must pos
sess three elements of power. He or
she must have a certain personality,
difficult Indeed to describe, but r" im
perative consequence. Broad scholar

and without which the highest power
cannot soon be realized is a thorough

This then is the special, the particu
lar function of the coming normal
school, to thoroughly prepare Its stu
dents for one of the noblest professions
in the world.
this school at the fall opening. Â»
In 1887 the Legislature established
a normal at Chico, upon whose build
ings: $130,000 have been expended. C.
C. Van Llew has been Its president for
five years. As the northern section of
California has but few high schools,
students are admitted at this school
by diploma from the ninth grade. At
tractive grounds, a fine museum and
excellent library are among the ex
cellent appointments. Nearly 600 stu
dents have graduated.
At the extreme southern end of Cali
fornia a normal school was created in
1897. A tract of sixteen acres overlook-
Ing the bay of San Diego was given
by the citizens of that city and upon
this a building of marked architectural
effect was erected for $100,000. - The en
rollment of students was surprisingly
large, having soon reached 262. One of
the novelties connected with this schc-ol

No academic work is given, the aim
of the management being .to concen
trate the energies of. the faculty upon
the best possible professional train
ing. .
Its training department is under the
charge of experienced supervisors and
is highly esteemed by the families of
San Francisco from which come the
grade scholars. None of the 131 grad
uates of the normal school have failed
of positions. If willing to. take them.
The school building Is old, iliabby, ill
adapted to present needs and is a re
proach to the State of California.
The organization of the normal school
system of California seems to be ad
mirably adapted to the widely varying
wants of different portions of the State.
Each normal school has a local board,
with the Governor and State Superin
tendent of Public Instruction as ex
offlcio members, which can give intelli
gent attention to its minor require
ments. Including the election of the
instructors upon nomination by the
president of the school. This secures
desirable independence to each school.
Through another board uniformity ' of
policy concerning the standards to be
observed and the general management
of the schools are obtained.
The members of this board consist

The exigencies of sex are tha solu
tions of economic problems.
A man wants a woman to love him,
and a woman, despite her extravagant
whims, wants to be loved. No sans
man will ever love or marry a woman
whose brain is a freak bazaar, conse
quently, the true womanly lovabl*
woman will always be a mighty factor
in the world's economic system long
after the new woman with her fads
and fancies and all round freakish
ness has been relegated to the past.
With her aping of man's pursuits
and habits and Â«* Â¦> cultivation of a
mannish swagger, the new woman
still lacked his strength, his resolu
tion and. above ail. his logic No
woman Is ever logical or unquestion
ingly reasonable. If she were she
would no longer be a woman, bat an
automaton. It is her caprices that
make her lovable or aggravating as
the case may be, and the more ca
pricious she may be the more will
men adore her.
The new woman could never be a
success; her overreaching proclivities
deny her the regard of women and de
fraud her of her birthrightâ the love
of man; and no matter how loudly
she may clamor for the prestige en-
Joyed by men she will be the object
â¢of ridicule rather than a shining ex
ample of self-renunciation that she
would have us consider her.
It is the womanly woman who. In
the end, will reign in undisputed sway
over the heritage of her little king'
dom. her home and the hearts of her
husband and children.
and there are precious few who have
been absolutely disinterested in tneir
overweening zeal.
The women who travel as delegates
for various organizations are often
totally unequal to earning one red
cent, 'but they have all their expenses
paid, wear swell togs, live at the best
hotels and Â«njoy all the luxuries of
life at the expense of their votaries,, or
dupes, as you may choose, to designate
them. The thousands and thousands
of dollars collected for the cause of
f'-male suffrage is the* potential ex
ample that trumpets its 6*wn story.
The original agitators were really the
incipient germs of the new woman.
For years' money, has been collected
from admiring enthusiasts. They have
posed conspicuously and emphatically
before the public, exploited their
views of everything and have lived
luxuriously on this kind * of gen
teel and have unflaggingly
whipped their followers into line. .
But the reaction came; the new
woman was too aggressive, she lost
her power through her own over
reaching. Her hand was always out
stretched to grasp 'everything, she
wanted to .rule ' supreme, and man in
philosophic mood let out the rope
wherewith she might hang herself.
Opposition would, have spurred her on
to even more aggressive lengths, but
the smile' of derision, tempered with
indulgence, with- which, men regarded
her flights left no incentive for war
fare and victory. And so the new
woman died of malnutrition. ' Men let
her alone, refusing to oppose.her, and
the . consequence was that she gradu-
meddlesome female aggregations are
Indigenous to' Northern soil. It is this
idea of independent or emancipated
woman that is responsible for the de
cadence of the home. The new woman
had no love for home in her* heart. She
was loud in looks and voice and man
ner, and her failure to impress or
gain a foothold is more or less ' attri
butable to her own self-assertiveness
tlfat carried her enthusiasm to such ex
tremes . as to relegate it to the realms
of absurdities.
The tailor-made costume Is one of the
triumphs, of the. century- and every
woman appreciates the cut and finish,
and It is the one glory of the new
woman fad. If she had but stopped
there, but she. wanted the whole outfit
cut on masculine lines, and the shirts
of -the progressive woman of a few
years ago were simply horrible.
It is hard to determine which is
worse, the /masculine, woman or the
effeminate man. There should be an

doomed.
She flashed before us with
spectacular effect â ehe threatened to
drive the baby trade out of business â
and as for "mere man." there seems
but one phrase applicable to him In
her esteem and that is most aptly ex
pressed In the slang of the day â "Go

She affected mannish togs and
thought herself the most fetching

No woman will wear anything
which the poor, dear, much abused
"mere man" does not admire, but let
her see the glad light of approval in
his eyes and, irrespective of her own

ment, asserting that they wear what
they rhoose. which may be very true.
but they wear it with infinitely more
pleasure after a man has approved of
it in his offhand way' and remarked,
"I like that gown," particularly If
that man happens to be â "the man."
Women may Insist that they do not
care for a man's admiration. Well,
I would not give a picayune for that
kind of woman, because when a
woman takes the pains and care to
dress and to look her best to pleast
her escort ehe pays him a compli
ment which he is a brute if he fails
to appreciate. The- man may be in
a business suit himself and mak.; his
apologies that he had not the time
to go home to dress, but if he found
the woman whom he had invited not
exactly up-to-date he would feel
wretchedly disappointed and hardly
care to invite her again. A man likes
to feel proud of a woman companion
and if she happens to have any one
gown In her wardrobe that he partic
ularly admires and in which he fan
cies she looks her best he is apt to
request her 'to don that one gown on
all occasions, always presupposing
that the friendship warrants any com
ments. If he contemplates introduc
ing her to his friends and w'shes her
to make the most favorable impres
sion then he will be very sure to make
such a request.
No man ever admired a woman
whom he found almost a reproduction
of himself. No man ever became sen
timental over a girl in a boiled shirt.
Perish the thought! The new woman
was too strong minded to stoop to
such insane folly as lovemaking. She
was a jolly good fellow with whom to
play tennis or golf or to take a hand
at the oars, and when she balanced
herself on a fence rail and smoked a
cigarette with as much aplomb as her
brother, she was the "best fellow on
earth" and the boyH liked her. 'â¢ but
later when the evening' shadows
darkened and each and every one be

THE REV. BRADFORD LEAVIIT.
fects some minds that reason fails to
reach, but in the long. run no move
ment that is* not based on truth and
hard sense can long succeed in this
country, and there is no prospect of
any apparatus by which the personal
liberty of Americans can be restricted
beyond a certain point. Liberty, like
charity, begins at home: and as a
nation we care even more for per
sonal liberty than for national liberty.
We cannot enforce temperance any
more than we can enforce religion.
We cannot legislate character into
men. That calls for means that are
not so easy. But while we cannot
prevent we can regulate, and from the
nature of the case we can apply reg
ulation more easily and with far less
irritation to the sale of drink than
to its use. This is the line on which
Earl Grey and other temperance
workers are bending their efforts in
England. They are trying to win
drinkers away from the low srrogger
ies by providing better and less
vicious drinking places. This is the
line on which Bishop Potter is work
ing. He believes not that the "Sub
way Saloon" is a cure for the drink
evil, but he believes it may be a step
in the right direction. And it might
be well for you and me and the rest
of us who haven't a tythe of this
man's knowledge of the problem to
suspend judgment and 'see what
comes of it. In any case, however,
it does no good to suppress the truth,
to call names, to attack honorable
men because their way is not our
way. Whatever har>oens let us at
least respect the opinions of those
from whom we differ, and concede
to others as much sincerity and hon
esty as we feel ourselves to possess.
who declare that the textbooks used
are unscientific and misleading.
No sane person who has\ looked
into the matter can doubt that cer
tain indorsed physiologies used for
instruction in the public schools A
certain States do a great deal more
harm than good, because they assert
as facts matters which are disputed on
excellent authority. We have no
intention of discussing here the ques
tion whether alcohol is a food, for
this is. a matter on which at present
authorities disagree, but it is certainly,
prolific of serious harm to teach chil
dren Â¦ to say, "We ' know that alcohol
is not a food," when we know nothing
of the kind. .
'. If we really must teach young chil
dren about alcohol, for heaven's sake
let us be quite honest about it and
teach correctly. If the textbooks
should assert that alcohol is danger
ous and should never be taken except
on the prescription of a physician,
few would object to the teaching.
But when, for the sake of producing
a moral impression some truth is sup
pressed and some distorted, the good
that is intended becomes evil and per
manent temperance work receives a
decided setback. "
The problem presented by. the evils
of intemperate use of alcoholic beve
rages is a pretty serious one and
people differ a good deal about the
best way to solve it, but one thing
seems tolerably clear and that is that
the trouble will never be cured bv
dishonesty or misdirected enthusiasm.
The cure will come from knowledge.
We must teach persons who drink
what they are about â what sort of an
agent they are dealing with. Din af-

There are in the world a good many

summed up his position in these
words: "You will gather from this
how superficial, how utterly inhuman
and unreasonable I regard a great
deal of that often well-intentioned
zeal which seeks to make men and
women virtuous bv a law of undis
criminate repression. I do. I do.
And if I am sent here of God for
nothing else I am sent here to tell
you and to entreat you to discern
that most of our methods of dealing
with the drink evil are tainted with
falsehood, dishonored by unreality
and discredited by 'Â¦ widespread and
consistent failure."
Brave words these; but they natu
rally aroused the ire of those who
believe that the only way to cure the
evil is by prohibition; and imme
diately these one-idea people began
scolding and abusing the good Bishop
and some of them told him iu 'no
uncertain terms that his teaching is
immoral; that he does not know what
he is talking about; that if he would
understand the dreadful evils of in
temperance he should get out of his
study and go down into the slums of
the city and see the poor mother of
seven children waiting and weeping
for the return of her drunken hus
band. As though Bishop Potter did
not know all this and more! Perhaps
his accusers do not know that the
reverend gentleman has not only

celebrated Rocky'Ford muskmelons are
to be. given away on the fair grounds.
The mere: anouncement of this has
caused Colorado to be talked about ex

scheme will give that State an adver
tisement that will have . an effect in
every part of the world, and the, mel
ons Won't cost, a great deal either. Ne

Austria, Italy and- Germany have
concessions to sell wine in the Palace
of Agriculture and they dispose -of it
by the bottle â¢ or -glass, even selling
single drinks of .champagne. Many
people of a good class who would like
to sample California, wines fail to do
so, as they do not like to in any; way
put " themselves ' in' the-' position'- of
"sparring- for a : free drlnk.".and :i know
they cannot buy rat the Wine Temple.
Whether it is better to let these go
their, way without sampling or ,to
strike a blow at California's firmly
rooted and; ancient' principle of hos
pitality by substituting. for it a. spirit
of .''commercialism is . a problem that
wijl' hardly be solved at this fair.
' ~ "I asked-' Superintendent Taylor'- of
this building about a concession to
Bell' wines,"- sarid- Haber, "and; he told
me it couldn't be " granted, ; because it
Would open" the way for : every dis
tillery in the country to sell liquor on
the grounds. I told him ours- was . a
State and not' an individual exhibit
and he said it made no -difference.
Foreign countries were granted a con^
cession-to sell; he i said, because they
had gone to such great expense to
bring 'their goods here. I spoke to
Commissioner Filcher- about getting a
concession, but" have heard nothing
from'it." Â¦Â¦-â¢â¢Â¦Â¦ . ' ' '"'" 'â¢ '.Â¦'"
'The foreign countries were\granted
concessions to sell wine because they
made that a condition precedent : to
their making exhibits," said Commis
sioner Filcher. 'Tasked aboufgettingr
one â¢< for Calif ornla, but was' told it
couldn't be ' granted. â¢ I am not ; sure,
anyway,' that the < wine men. would care
to charge for their goods at the fair."
Whether it is ' better to give pro
ducts away ; or to charge a â¢ nominal
price for them to cover . : .the -cost â¢ is a
qutstion , that Is : cominigr to v^the . front
and; will probably '"be considered- by
those interested in, making California
exhibits, at coming, fairs. ' . Commis
sioner, Filcher. Is of the opinion that a
charge 1 should- be made to' cover cost
and will try to carry, out. this idea at
the Portland Fair. ' ; Many: California
representatives are â¢ firmly, opposed to
this idea; as they say the; fair fame of
California" would be -damaged by'( In
troducing-commercialism into : the ad
vertising of her' resources and (that a
great State ' cannot .show' better the
prodigality, of her; : products than by
free-handed hospitality, which' brings
a.^thousandfold' better/ returns than
â¢would 'come j'f romV'a display ' which ' it

"A comparison of. notes among the
county commissioners brought to light
the fact that efforts tobuy : California
wine are -constantly-being made?at the
various : booths In the California- sec
tion by' people -who want ] it at'once.
They are always referred to the Wine
Temple,. \where they are told:.by.Com
missioner Haber, in charge there, that
he will take'their orders and'sehd to
California the" wine they desire.
The county representatives are confi
dent that- had a concession been -ob
tained to" 5 sell vine ; in th^ '.Palace of
Agriculture . >many hundreds of cases
would have been disposed â¢ of, , the
buyers being .people; from many, sec

many visitors who .wish to try Cali
fornia wines and would buy a few bot
tles to take , with. them could they, get
them while' here/^ Many . concessions
a^dfStatS and foreign buildings would
probably buy some of the wine were
it convenient to' do so; There is said
to-be one, large house lnSt. Louis that
represents .three. California firms,

WIXE BY THE GLASS. -
The lady who wanted the wine rep
resented a prominent concession in the
Palace of "Agriculture, where the us
ing of the wine would v have been a
good . advertisement : for the product,
as 1 well [ as a" 1 matter of profit, to ' the
producer! â¢ She came to the California
section; thinking she could get all she
wanted at-once, but found she could
not "buy 'any "at" all. ' She sent'down
town and' bought two, cases of Ohio
wine.- " Â¦ Â¦
Â¦ "Well,^ I; can't," said the~ man- who
had first spoken. "I have tried at' the
Wine. Temple and -have asked at a
good many places downtown and the
best lean ! do is' to 'leave an order at
the- Wine Temple ' and get the goods
in two Weeks. .

of the h6uses downtown." â¢- T -- â¢ Â¦â¢.- -

â¢ CHICAGO. Sept. 10.â A board of
conciliation, selected by the Republic
Iron and Steel Company and 20,000 of
its employes, has met here to fix a
scale of wages for the coming year.
The decision of the board was with
held pending additional arguments by
the employes, which are to be heard
to-day. The dispute which the board
is to settle arose over the desire of
the company to reduce the wages of
its skilled "merchant" iron workers
from 5 to 15 per cent As provided
la the working agreement, which has
been in force since 1901, conference
cemmittees from the company and the
unions having failed to agree on an
adjustment of wages, the matter was
left to a board of conciliation. v'-;"v
The arguments of the company
tended to show that reduction in its
business, combined with large outlays
in the erection of new plants, did. not
Justify the continuation of last year's
wage scale. These claims were met by
the steel workers' representatives with
the contention that the number of em
ployes had been reduced in several
plants, thus comparatively lightening
the expenses.

they are in the last stages of consump- '
tlon end that no treatment can help :
them, it is surely a wonderful relief, !
both physically and mentally, to find a !
treatrofent that has curative effects. My j
condition was a very serious one, and all
the medical treatment that I used did !
me no good. I heard of the success of!
Electro-Chemistry in serious diseases !
like my own and I went to the Electro- i
Chemic Institute, No. 118 Grant Ave.. for i
a careful examination. This examina- J
tlon was free and it was so thorough |
that I had great hopes when the Electro- i
Chemic specialists told me that Electro-
Chemistry would cure me. I be^an-the!
treatment Immediately, and in a short '
time my condition was greatly improved '
In extty way. When I first went to the
Institute my breathing was so short that i
I could hardly go up the stairs. I had a
very serious cough and I expectorated j
horrible looking matter from my lungs. .
I had fever In the afternoons and had i
Eight sweats. I had lost a great deal of !
flesh and was so weak that ' I could
scarcely ret about. I feel like a new
woman now. I .feel stronger in every
way. The cough has disappeared. The
tight sweats, and the afternoon fevers
bare *Â»th disappeared. I do not expecto-
rate bad looking matter from my lungs,
and all this has been accomplished In a
very short time and at very little ex-
pense. 1 feel It my duty to tell other
â¢offerers of the wonderful effects of Elec-
tro-Chemistry In bad cases like ray own,
My name Is Mrm. M. McDougall and I

â¢ It U cures like these that is making
the Electro-Chemic treatment famous
and It Is because oC such cures that In

Brentano'f court to-day when Mrs.
Louisa von Glostomski was. granted a
divorce from Valerian von Glostom
Â£ki for drunkenness.
Fred W. ltice said he had seen Von
Glostomski drunk frequently. "He
had a jag every week on lodge nights,"
he said.
"A man can have a jag and not be
drunk, can't he?" said Judge Bren
ta.no.
"When a man has enough of a jag
to abuse people he meets on the
etreets I should say he was drunk,"
replied Rice.
"So should I," assented Judge Bren
tano. "But when a man while in
liquor abuses people he has passed tha
jag state. He is then a plain drunk."

OMAHA, Sept. 10. â H. A. Herrick,
recently editor of the Denver Sunday
Post, wax correspondent for the New
Tork Herald during the war with
Epain, graduate of Oxford and son of
an English Baron, is a fugitive from
Justice. The County Attorney to-night
f.'ed in secret an information charging
Herrick with bigamy.
Herrick is believed to be in Denver
or Spokane and offlcers of the West
ern cities have been notified to arrest
him.
Herrick's marriage to Miss Alma
"L'rlau of this city a few weeks ago
Â¦was one of the important society
events of the season. News of the ef
fcrts to cause his arrest is certain to
cause a sensation.
Herrick was connected with one of
the local newspapers until a few days
ago. He was a man of many attain
ments, who quickly made friends
cmong the best residents and his so
cial position was assured from the
first. He and his latest bride have
teen back from their honeymoon only
a few days.
X. A. Crawford, an Iowa attorney,
visited the County Attorney to-day
with the information that Herrick had.'
a wife and 10-year-old daughter In
Spokane, "Wash.
The first Mrs. Herrick was a Miss
Garbraith. The man left his family
in Spokane several months ago and
has not been heard from by them
since. Inquiries instituted by Mrs.
Herrick led to the discovery of her
husband in this cjty. Herrick is be
lieved to have leirned of his wife's
search for him and to have gone "West
to straighten out family affairs just
at the time papers were being pre
pared for his arrest.
The latest Mrs. Herrick is at the
home of her parents in this city. She
is .a handsome woman, the sister of
Katherine Urlau, an actress in David
Bcrlasco's Darling of the Gods Com
pany.
Herrick's father is Sir William H.
Herrick of Derbyshire. England. Her
rick was famous in college as an.
athlete.

"To all who assert I acted badly and

Her appeals to her father, the King
of Belgium, she says, were unavailing.
The King was of a type exactly similar
to Prince Phllipp and espoused the lat

"I am old, but my heart remains
young and seeks affection," continues
the Princess in her publication. "I do

Your correspondent, ."who was â¢work

passed a number of Russian troops
that had beea beaten back from
around Yentai. He also passed a train
bearing 500 Russian wounded to the
north. The road was filled with Cai-
the Japanese were again to possession.
General Ktxrokfs attack at Yentai
relaxed, however, and Geaeral Mist
chenko and his command were with
drawn from the Russian defenders cf
Yentai and sent over to the west side
of the railroad to make a demonstra
tion and to aid to covering the retreat
of the main army.
At 5 o'clock to thÂ» arlernooa cf
September 2 two Russian regiments
which had beea beaten to the east of
Yentai retreated toward Yentai. They
were ordered back to the fighting liae
while still under a shan> Japanese
rifle fire.
The foreign military attaches had
beea escorted from Liaoyang to the
north. They left their train at a point
rear Yantai and proceeded to the di
rection cf the fighting between Ku
roki's troops and the Russians who
were attempting to hold them back.
Here the Russians had lost aa impor
tant hill position, only to regain it and
then lose it a second time. This greatly
discouraged the Russian soldiers. It is
declared that the immediate and pre
cipitous retreat of the entire Russian
army at Liaoyang was prevented by
the retaking of this hill, which lies to
the east of Yentai. The Russians, how
ever could not held the hill and soon
sian position to the coal mining dis
trict to the east of Yentai. The impor
tance and effect of General Kurokl's
dash to the rear of the Russian army
was particularly noticeable this morn

are taken.
Two full divisions are available in
this vicinity, under General* Oshima
and Tuchiya. The entire Japanese fcrcs
now surrounding Port Arthur is" esti
mated at SO.000 fighting mea. The Rss
sians are now using exclusively powder
evidently manufactured at Port Ar
thur. The smoke from this po-wd>r
enables an instant detection cf the
source cf the fire. The explosive power
of the powder Is far less than that cf
smokeless powder, which the Russians
seem to have exhausted. The Russian
shells are frequently discovered to b*
old Chinese affairs, filed down to Â£t
the Russian guns.
XEW FLAX OF ATTACK.
The Japanese plan for the ccmis? as- i
sault, it is understood, does not tocltide j
aa assault oa Etxshaa. The nature of
the ground, the Japanese have found at !
severe cost, prevents a successful issue, j
Etzshan, however, will be engaged by (
artillery from Louisa Bay and Shusii- i
yea "for the purpose of attracting the'
fire of Etzshan away frcm ths mala j
attack.
Your informant quotes an Argentine-)
colonel who is with the Japanese as
saying that the Russian defenses fac
ing the Japanese have been made with
a perfection undreamed of. The inner '
sides, cf the forts, however, are not
so well constructed and are supposed- J
ly far weaker.
With Rihlungshan and Kikwanshan
captured, the Japane3* will practlcany
control an entrance along the railway. :
and they contemplate assaulting ether j
forts from their weaker sides.
The Japanese cay they are prepared
to lose heavily ia taking Rihlungshan
and Kikwanshan. These forts, like a
majority of the fifty-four forts sur
rounding Port Arthur, have six-Inch
steel shields, loop-holed with rapid
fire guns at intervals. These guns, ac
cording to the Informant, and not
land mines, have proved most disas- ]
trous to % the Japanese. The shields!
are ircx>ervious to field artillery. Xoth- j
ing but siege gun3 win make aa im- j
presslon upon them.
ELECTRICITY A \TEAPOX.
The Russians send strong electric
currents through the wire entangle
ments surrounding the forts while the
Japanese are attacking.
Ths press correspondents with the
Japanese are only two miles from the
front, but the MHy ground prevents
them seeing anything.
The fighting since August 31 has
been unimportant. The Japanese
bombard daily in the morning, when
the sun assists them in aiming. The
Russians reply in the afternooa. when
the sun is la their favor.
The Japanese losses for the last five
weeks are placed at 20,000 men.
The Japanese authority for the fore
going statement of conditions before
Port Arthur says that Its publication
will not be harmful, as the Japanese
preparations are fully evident to the
Russians.
The range of hills crowned by Kik
wanshan and Rihlungshan have Irre
gular slopes, enabling a large force of
Japanese to rest securely some distance
up the slope. The Japanese have tents
pitched and they are relieved every
three days. Food and ammunition and
other supplies are brought them at
night only, for the reason that the de
tachments are obliged to cross a level
stretch before reaching a place cf
safety.

the noses of the Russians now, are par
tially constructed. The Russians en

There seems little doubt that the as
sault on Rihlungshan and Kikwanshan
will be more trying than any that
the Russians have yet resisted. Every
thing which ingenuity can eu^gesz is
being done by the Japanese to render
the attack successful, particular atten

In the event that they capture them.
Among the contrivances to be employed
are numerous heavy movable shields,
which have been constructed at Dalny
and which will be used to afford pro
tection. .Guns and shields will be moved
as closely together as possible through
the trenches before the assault Is made
in order that they may be quickly
The work of constructing trenches Is
advancing rapidly, considering Â¦ the

KURORTS FLAXK ATTACK.
It became known that General Ku
roki was making a dash around the
Russian left for the railroad at a point
fifteen "miles north cf here. He crossed
the Taitse River the night of August
SO and took the splendid Russian de
fenses at Pensiha with very little effort.
He continued to advance steadily and
turned the Russian left. His army cov
ered fifteen miles in c.uick time. The
effect of Its presence and movements
was . to force the Russians to leave
Liaoyang and retire in the direction of
the coal mines east of Yentai. He
.threatened to cut General Kuropatkin's
army of seven corns in two. - -

ammunition from the railroad sheds.
The Japanese shells came from" Shu

Japanese shell killed a horse a few feet

and the riJfraff cf the streets, all seek

the city. The Chinese immediately be
gaa to loot, but whenever they were
caught swift punishment' was meted
out to them.
SLAV RESERVES CALLED UPOX.
This was at noca cf September 1. Oa
that day the Russians filled all the
trenches, rifie pits and forts to the
west and south of Liaoyang with fresh
troops. They kept up a ccatiaual shrap
nel fire u->cn the Japanese approaches,
without being aware cf the exact move
ments of the enemy. During this time
the main body of the Russian army
was ia active retreat.
At S o'clock in the evening the Japa
nese shells were falling just outside the
western wall and ca the Russian helio
graph "station at the northwest corner
cf the city. Frcm this station the Japa
nese could now be seen. Ttey Â¦were ad
vancing splendidly over the southern
hills. Their formation was regular and
open. The ranges of the Jaranes* posi
tions were known to the Russian gun
ners, who poured ia a terrible fire upoa
the enemy. A Japanese battery and
two companies of infantry were seen
skirting the main south road. They
were moving toward the city and final
ly disappeared behind Kowliasg.
The positions at Caiafactan were
seen to be deserted. The right Sank of
General Xodxu's army, had previously
taken up a position to the west cf Cni
afantun. whence his troops charged the
Russian breastworks. One Japanese
battalion lest every oScer in this
charge and a corporal was seen to' take
command. The Japanese Intrenched ia
the vicinity of Tishl. near where Gea
eral IvasoS had had his headquarters
the day bifcre.
"The Russian Red Cross wcrked con
tinually on the firing line.
The Japanes* shells fell thick over
the Russian battery located In a west
era suburb cf Liaoyang.'
Late that night, as the correspondent

ed Rcssiaa soldier was borne past him,
sheeting out In. a delirious voice that
General Kurcpatkia had gained a great
victory over the Japanese.
At S o'clock on tha mcrniag of Sep

army was still going out to the north
and the b*ad cf th* train -was almost

and the southeast into Liaoyang on
the SCth.
The Russians made use of a field
balloon all day long on the 3?th and
by means cf it they got the range of
one Japanese battery, which they suc
ceeded ia putting out of action. As a
ireneral thing, however, they failed to
find either the enemy's batteries cr his
troops, while the Japanese continued
to silence Russian battery after bat
tery.
At 3 o'clock in the afternoon of the
30th the Japanese shelled a Russian
battery, posted on a hill within three
miles of Liaoyang. but shortly after
At 10 o'clock on the morning of the
SCth. General Kuropatkin's staff moved
out of Liaoyang. At the same time
rifie fire was heard drawing nearer
to the railroad station, and this was
taken as an Indication of the advance
of the Japanese left army.
OKXTS ARMY ADVAXCES.
The character cf the Japanese ad
vance apparently had served as a
warning to General Kuropatkin to
make rcre cf his retreat, and . his
transport was at once seen moving
rapidly out of Liaoyang over the rail
road birdge.
Oa August SO the Japanese closed In
cjr-on the Russians in their mountain
position at Chlaf antun. Here the guns
were so dose to one another that it
wts almost possible for the battery
commanders to see one another's spec
tacles.
On Aug-ert 29 the artillery under
General Xodzu bombarded fiercely the
three hills of Chiafantun. Oa the
same day General Oku. in command
of the Japan left army, working his
way with rise fire and artillery, slowly
advanced along the railroad, in spite
cf the Russian opposition from neigh
boring elevations and fortifications.
The left army thus moved toward
Shushan- The Russian cavalry was
not able to locate the Japanese
trenches oa this advance.
LJAOY.OCG. Sept. 4, via Tientsin,
September 10. â The Japanese' at S
o'clock yesterday evening discovered
that the Russians had evacuatedUao

ing parties to the southern and west

this morning the troops of the vic
torious army Quietly entered and oc
cupied Liaoyang. General Kuropat

This success was achieved after five
days of glorious fighting.
After General Kuroki had noted the
march of the Tenth Russian Army
Corps, which ho had driven In from
the Anpins road to the plain, on its
way to Join the Russian center, which
General Xodzu had forced in from
Kaofengshi, he divided his forces sta

suSdently strong force on the Feng

Xodzu. who was pushing on with the
Japanese center army along the Meng

The Chinese at Liaoyarsg became

they fled in disorder, gted to get away
with their lives.
IVAXOFF FACES XODZU.
-During the night of the 31st the
Russians deemed the position of the
enemy to be so threatening that they
made preparations to fall back.
General Mistchenko was on the ex
treme left of the Russian line, with "a
division composed of cavalry, artil
lery and infantry- During the night
of the 31st his force was sent out in
a northeasterly direction to gain In
formation concerning General Kuro
ki*s movement around the Russian left
Sank in the direction of the railroad.
Mistchenko's movement was of short
duration and he soon returned to his
line.
During the day the Russian rifle
fire was indescribably furious. The
Russian trenches, for a distance of
several miles, threw out all day long
a continuous hail of lead, accom
panied by unceasing flashes of fire. In
spite of its continued ferocity this riSe
fire was comparatively ineffectual, the
Russians often firing without sight of
the enemy. This hail of Russian rifle
bullets did not cease before, 10 o'clock
at n&ht. It is estimated that 1000
Russian shells. -were thrown into the
valley beyond the south 'road, where
the only evidence of the presence of
the Ja^arrese was a^ Red Cross camp.
At nightfall General Stakelberg;
with the First Corps, was stitt facing
General Oku on the left. This Rus
sian corps hid lost 3000 men.
At 5 o'clock in the evening the fight
ing which had raged all day long cen
tered along the south road, where for
two hours there was a heavy artillery
fire and a-vast amount of ammunition
was expended. The vailey in front and
under the Russian guns during this
artillery duel \ras an inferno of
shrieking and moaning shrapnel, while
beyond the Russians* shells burst con
tinuously at the head of the Japanese
advance. -* - - .
There was very hard fighting at a
round topped hill In the Russian line
opposite the point where the two Jap
anese armies under Generals Nodzu
and Oku came together. The Rus
sian position here was protected with
wire entanglements and a small body
of Russian Troops absolutely refused
to retire. In one trench seven men
fought gallantly until they were sur
rounded by the Japanese. At the end
of this sharp fighting, the Russians
were hurling down sandbags upon the
enemy. They succeeded In killing one
Japanese officer and injuring another,
after which they surrendered and the
hill was occupied by the enemy.
IXFERXO OF SHRAPXEL.
The Japanese, from a low range -of
hills to the southeast and south of
Shushan. began shelling the northern
er.d of the Russian line at Shushan at
a quarter before 10 on the morning of
the 31st. This artillery fire was pre
ceded and accompanied by infantry
rushes over the valley and the low
hills south of the road. They began
before dawn and were continued until
c-venrrxg. the Japanese officers urging
their worn out ar.d fainting men with
the points of their swords.
this hour it became apparent that the
Russians had begun to hold their own.
By 4 o'clock in the afternoon the Jap
anese shrapnel fire \ras confined to the
position at Chiaiant;un, -where the
Kussi&iis were disputing every hillock,
with the enemv. The Japanese made
repeated but unsuccessful assaults
upon this position. The fighting of the
SCth came to a close at T o'clock In
the evening^ The Russian casualties
for the 2?th and the 30th totaled more
than 5000 men.

The actions of the Chinese at Liao
yang, when the change In masters of
the city occurred, was astonishing.
They had fattened long on the Russian
occupation, but as soon as' the Japan
ese were known to be coming in they
made itady with their newly manufac
tured Japanese flags to greet tho con
querors. . Chinese shopkepers ' at on.ee
hid all the goods in their possession
which bore Russian marks. Thte was a
wine i-recautlon, as .:he Japanese tr<:oy3
"later looted all such property, even
br<*aking into neJlral premises svhjers
it had been placed -for safe, keeping. .
' Just before thÂ«S Japanese entered the

ing at Haicheng and Anshanshan,.that
the war had not begun yet and that
the Japanese were playing a very dan
gerous game. It was generally believed
among the Russian troops that the
Japanese were enlisting boys- and old
men in their- ranks,. for otherwise they
could not account-Â»for the large 'num
bers of soldiers opposed to them in the
held. The attitude of many of the Rus

changing, however, and the more intel
ligent are beginning to give the enemy
full credit for;his sagacity and worth.
The majority . of Louisville's com
mandery took their departure from
San Francisco yesterday, but' it will
be several days before they will pass
beyond- the State line, for they came
West with the avowed purpose of see-
Ing as much of California as possible,
and before returning to their ' Ken
tucky homos their object will have
been accomplished. A number of the
Louisville Knights started northward
yesterday over the Shasta route with
a view of seeing Northern California,
while others' took the coast route to
visit the southland.' It is the inten
tion-of the members of the command
ery to eventually reassemble In St.

; The twenty-ninth triennial conclave,.
Knights Templar, was most fittingly
wound up last night by an ._entertain
ment of brilliant proportions by Cali
fornia Commandery No. .1 at the Me
chanics' Pavilion. Â¦" From the .opening
of the doors at 7 o'clock until midnight,
when .'the band played VAuId Lang
Syne,", a steady stream of the repre
sentative people of the citv and many
visitors poured in and out .through, the
portals of the doors. It is â¢ estimated
that during this closing festival - at
least 23.000 were present to bid a.fare
well filled with .pleasant memories to
this great conclave. '
â¢By 8 o'clock every seat was filled
and'hundreds stood craning their necks
to get even a glimpse of the drill of
the. Third Congregational Cadet Corps,
which opened \ the , programme of the
evening. Thedrillwas in command of
Captajn.R, B.' Moore and Lieutenants
A. A.' Moore and W. B.Oisen. It lasted
twenty-five minutes and- was greatly
applauded. The cadets . looked very
fine In their uniformsâ blue coats,
white trousers and white helmets. .
Next came the California Command
ery Drill Corps, commanded by Sir
Knight R. P. Hurlbut and Lieutenants
T. A. Clarke .and Henry Ray.; "The
drill lasted forty minutes and every
movement .was rewarded by thunders
of applause. It consisted of the fol
lowing evolutions: The passion cross,
the GretJk cross, the x maltese cross,
triarigrjes, single and double circles,', the
regulation Templar, manual' and. the
sword manual. - The drill was regarded
as almost perfect and . received ., the
highest of j praise from the
Sir Knights present." As the, corps left
the hair the vast audience arose.. and
gave ' them a â¢ mighty cheer.. , .
. Following this came a concert at the
California headquarters in . the â¢ art
room, the artists who took partln this
being L.; A. Larson, E. Boysen. Miss
Rogers, Mme. Caro Roma and Eugenia
Barker Mills. A', grand bali-f brought
the festivities to a close.
Just before midnight Bennett's .Band
struck up. "Auld Lang Syne," and' the
body of Sir Knights in the hall,- headed
by Commander CM. Plum,' marched
around the great hall" and then up
stairs to visit the ; different command
eries. This brought the great function
to a close and the Immense 'crowd of
people filed out Into the streets.

The departure of Sir Knight Charles
D. Meyer, dean of the Louisville drill
corps, was keenly regretted by many
who helped to entertain the Kentuck
ians during their stay in San Fran
cisco. On him devolved the duty of
providing for the comforts of his fel
low. Knights during their Western
Journey and their visit at the Golden
Gate, and that he fulfilled his task- in
a satisfactory manner was attested by
all the members â¢ of the crack drill
corps. He Is a past commander of
Kentucky and has been a member of
the Louisville drill corps for twenty
one years, during which his interest
in the success of that organization has
never waned. When . his corps car
ried off the trophy in the competitive
drill at the park' his loud cheers were
plainly heard by the assembled Ken
tuckians, who re-echoed them with a
vim, for they all realized that Meyer,
who has not participated in the drills
for. several years, had enjoyed the re
alization of one of his long cherished
hopes.
At the beginning of the five days'
fighting: the hotels and pleasure resorts
of Liaoyang: were deserted, soldiers and
fflif-ers having been ordered to the
fighting line.- But as the men came
back into the city from the front many
of those who could indulged themselves
in such pleasures as the city afforded.
The Russian soldiers persistently un
derestimated the strength of the Jap
en^so, and in Liaoyang the statement
was often heard, even after the fight-
LIAOYANG. Sept. 4 (via Tientsin).
Sept. 10. â Many foreigners who ob
served the Russian troops at Liao
yang before the battle which resulted
in the Japanese occupation of the city
ere of the opinion that the Russian re
verse was the result of the last four
months of failure in the field â of what
they term the "demoralization" which
btgan at the battle of Kuliencheng.
The task of General Kuropatkin seemed
to be hopeless. The railroad during
the month of July scarce sufficed to
bring into Liaoyang enough Russian
troops to replace those who were lost
by drain, sickness or wounds during'
the month, and it was estimated that
the Russians would have to outnum
ber the Japanese two to one in order
to bo eut-cossful against them, while
puardm? the railroad.
Scenes witnessed in Liaoyang before
the big battle gave evidence of a cer
tain degree of demoralization on the
part of the Russian forces. After the
Japanese had won their first successes
at Anshanshan and KoafengsSi and
v ere advancing rapidly on the second
line of Russian defenses, some of the
Russian officers who had been on the
fighting line flung their responsibilities
aside immediately after they reached
Liaoy&ng and sought forgetfulness of
the hardships of their past work and
the danpers of the future. The Pa
goda Garden was gay v.ith merrymak
ers. There was much drinking and the
sounds of music and the singing of
cafe chantant song^ in women's voices

words and after wishing him godspeed
the deputation with.drew.

TOKIO, Sept, 10. 9 p. m.â general
Kuroki. advancing to the northwest
last Sunday and Monday, forced the
Russians to retreat to Mukden- It is
reported that the Russians,' after Mon
day's fight, carried more than 10,000
wounded north of Mukden. It appears
that they ingeniously removed a ma
jority of their dead, but left more than
3000 dead in the vicinity of Liaoyang.
The retreating Russians saved their
guns, but abandoned and exploded
their ammunition. The number of am
munition carts found In the trenches
was enormous.
The Japanese casualties have not yet
been reported.
On Sunday night, at 10 o'clock. Gen
eral Kuroki's central column attacked
a strong Russian force at Tallenkou,
cast of Tentai. After a night's fierce
fighting the Russians were driven
westward. General Kuroki's left col
umn, working west, occupied Langyipu
on Sunday afternoon, the artillery
shelling the retreating Russians for
thirty or forty minutes. Kuroki's right
column advanced northwest of Wang
mientzushan, twenty-five miles south
of Mukden.
The Russians continued to retreat.
Their rear guard of cavalry holds a :ine
extending northwest of Hsiliho and
Shanchiatzu. The Russian outposts
hold a line of covered trenches on the
heights east of Panchiagao. A body of
unknown strength remains at Kuchi
etzu, Pachiatzu and Kaulinpao. The
main body of the Russians retired to
Slukdcn, burning the bridges across the
fc-ha River.

/.'/Trade in'the Far East is now at a

"Now the troops of the Mikado; with
victories galore to -their credit, have
legs chance of final success than they
had some months ago. ' Strategically
the Japanese campaign in Manchuria
is a failure, because, conforming to' the
national desire to posses Port Arthur,
,the Japanese devoted too . much force
to. their endeavor to take that fortress.
They devided their ; strength, and the
result was that they failed- to crush
Kuropatkin.-- - - . ...... â ...
"Military authorities say- that this
movement cannot be called an envel
oping movement, being merely an at
tack on Kuropatkin's left flank. The
guards; division of Kuroki's army was
not seriously engaged in the fighting
on September 3. It had been hurried
northward to reinforce.^ the twelfth
division on the morning of that day,
but the extreme caution of the Jap
anese held the guards in reserve, for
fear of a counter attack by "the', Rus
sians on the left center. . . Such an at
tack was impossible, owing to the long
line which was necessary to the Rus
sians to cover their position.
"Kuropatkin's safe withdrawal and
virtual victory, place him in the highest
position as a commander. In a mar
velously short time he has reorganized
an inefficient army, badly officered and
ignorant of the science of war, into a
good fighting machine under -perfect
control. This was done with a" large
percentage of the same troops that had
been defeated again and again by â¢ the
Japanese.
CHICAGO, S,ept. 10.-â John F. Bass,
war correspondent for the Daily News
of this city, reached Chef u to-day
after some months spent with Gener
al-Kurbki's army. In a cablegram to
his paper, dated to-day, Bass is un
sparing in his criticism of the Japan
ese commanders. He declares that
the Japanese have 4 00,000 men in the
field, while Kuropatkin's army is
much smaller than the Russians would
have their foes believe, and is -made
up for the most part of raw Siberians
whom Kuropatkin has gradually
whipped into an effective fighting
force after they had, been repeatedly,
defeated by the Japanese. â¢
Bass declares that the Japanese, by
their, slowness, have, forfeited . their
chance to destroy the Russian force,
which. now is practically out of dan
ger and only awaits the arrival of re
inforcements to turn the tide of war.
The; war writer has only words â¢ of
praise for the Japanese troops, whose
utter fearlessness Is marvelous, but. he
says the strategy- of the Japanese of
ficers merely, consists in sending these
brave men straight ahead, no matter
what the obstacle.
"After passing months in contriv
ing an exact combined movement from
the . south and west to crush the Rus
sian army at Liaoyang, . the Japanese
failed," he says, "through: the slow
ness and timidity of their, strategy, to
throw 'a. sufficiently' large, force from
Kuroki's army far enough to the east
and north to cut oft* the Russian re
treat. They might have annihilated
the Russians when, after fighting one
of the greatest rear guard battles of
history, the retirement from Liaoyang
began on the nighjt of. September 3.
"The Japanese right wing, consist
ing of the twelfth division only, was
then thirteen miles east by north of
Liaoyang, calling for' reinforcements.

twenty-ninth triennial conclave on the
golden shores of the Pacific. Almost a
quarter of a century ago we met In
this good city of San Francisco.
Knightly greetings, expressions of
friendship, hospitality unbounded, such
evidences of affection induced us to
embrace the earliest opportunity again
to grasp the hand and listen to the
loved voices that so charmed us in '83."
In conclusion the grand master's re
port says: "JÂ£y term of office is a
thing of the past. Peace and prosper
ity encircle our organization. My
labors are over. God be with you till
we meet again."
Mr. Stoddard also expressed a de
sire to thank Reuben H. Lloyd, W.
Frank Pierce, Charles M. Plum and
Frank W. Sumner, to whomi he said,
are due in a great measure the success
of the conclave.
One of the incidents of the conclave
that went to the heart of the. Templar
leader more than all the decorations
and honors conferred upon him was
the decoration of his daughter, Char
lotte Stoddard. by the Earl of Euston
with the cross of the Great Priory of
England, Ireland and Wales. Another
gift was received by Miss Stoddard
that was also as pleasingâ a beaten
gold pin from the California Command
ery.
Mr. Stoddard, accompanied by his
daughter, leaves this morning at 8:15
for Salt Lake, where they will rest for
a few days before proceeding to their
home at Bryan, Texas.

SANTA ROSA, Sept. 10.â Word was
received here to-night of a forest fire
on Big Sulphur creek, in the northern
part of Sonoma County. It swept over
Black Mountain, and surrounded and
destroyed all the buildings, of the So
noma Consolidated Quicksilver Com
pany, near Pine Flat. The company's
loss probably . will be $2000, the only
buildings known to be saved being the
office and cookhouse. The Sonoma
Consolidated is composed principally
of Santa Rosa men, and last year they
built an immense new smelter at a cost
of $15,000. # .
To-day's fire recalls the last con
flagration in that section twenty years
ago, when Pine Flat, then an impor
tant settlement and prosperous min
ing camp, was swept out of existence.
It was only two years ago that the
work of rebuilding commenced, the re
sult being a revival in the quicksilver

ST. LOUIS, Sept/ ." 10.â Among the
speakers at the Admission day celebra
tion . at the exposition ; was Park Com
missioner Frank Sullivan. His subject
was "The Pioneers* of. California." As a
member of Santa. Cruz Parlor of the
Native Sons and as a son of a pioneer
of j 1844, Sullivan was well qualified to
speak on the subject. He said:
"The pioneers were of all nationali
ties, but all had American sympathies.
They were Celtlc-Saxon. The history
of California is that of the pioneer; she
was his child. The name of California
has for the Calif ornian a significance
pf its. own because of its romantic ori
gin. The character of the pioneer has
hot been understood. He was the most
stalwart and energetic of his race. His
was a case of the survival of the fittest.
'There were two classes of pioneers
one: came before 1846, the other after
1846, the date of the discovery of gold.
They were heroes. All men love heroes,
and when they have .them not they
create them."
Mr. Sullivan showed that the pioneers
were entitled to the grateful remem
brance of Americans, especially of Cal
if orniaris, for these reasons:
First â For their courage and .'endur
ance in overcoming all obstacles in
their journeys to the Pacific Coast.
Secondâ Because they made Califor
nia one of the United States.
Third â Because they discovered gold.
Fourth â Because they settled the des
tiny of the Pacific Ocean favorably to
the United States/
Fifthâ Because they made California
a free State.
Sixthâ Because they saved the finan
cial honor of the United States with
their gold.
Seventhâ Because they lived without
a regular government, yet within the
bounds of law, from 1846 to 1850.
Eighthâ Because there was no pov
erty during the pioneer days.
In conclusion Sullivan eloquently
said:
"All honor to the pioneer, for it was
he who taught the American the value
of self-reliance in his/conflict with na
ture and with his fellow man. All
honor to the pioneer, for it was he who
established the principle that under
American Institutions man must be re
garded as a brother. and as a moral be
ing superior to forms of government,
to statutory rules and to trappings of
authority. All honor to the pioneer, for
it was he who by his magic touch dis
solved the spell of centuries, opened the
doors of treasuries v of untold wealth
arid saved* the financial -honor of the
United States. All honor to the pio
neer, for It was he who placed the
great Pacific Ocean in the power of the
American people. All honor to the pio
neer, for.it was he who set in the con
stellation of the United States, the
thirty-first star to add a golden luster
to the splendor of those which form
the gldry of the republic."

â¢ier says: One striking feature of the
bank statement last week was the re
markably close agreement between the
loss of cash last week, and another fea
ture was the expansion in loans last
week, this gain being only about $5,000,
000 below the increase of the week end
ing September 3. The losses of cash
last week were $7,908,600; in the pre
vious week It was $7,428,700, making
$15,234,500 for the fortnight The de
crease In cash last week very -nearly
agreed with the loss of $8,659,900 which
was estimated upon the basis of the
traceable movements of money, and the
difference between the two amounts
may easily be accounted for in great
part by the fact that $1,500,000 was
withdrawn from the. banks on Friday
for transfer to San . Francisco, which
sum was not Included In the estimates.
The deposits were increased $4,625,400,
and the resulting augmented , reserve
requirement /was $1,156,350, ..which . sum
added to the loss of cash made $9,0*5,
150 as the result in the surplus reserve
to $38,398,250, a loss, as above noted,'
of $1S.927,15O fpr the fortnight.
Computed upon* the, basis of deposits,
less those of $23,359,200 public funds,
the 'surplus Is $44,278,200. The state-
ment showed a good proof, the sum of
the Increase in loans less the loss in
cash being only $719,400 more than the
increase in deposits.
Loans were expanded $13,233,600, mak
ing a gain of $31,429,000 In the fortnight
This would seem to reflect corporation
borrowing and also large 1 rediscouritlng
by the New York banks for the English
correspondents. Comparison shows that
six banks gained $10,000,000 net in loans
and eight' banks lost $8,000,000 net in
cash. " .Â¦""'
Bank Statement Shows Remarkable
Condition of Money Market-
ICEW YORK, Sept. 10.â The Finan-
MANY LOANS MADE.
The principal activity In the bond
market has been in speculative issues,
and the tone has been Irregular at
times. United States Government 3's
registered declined one-fourth Â«per cent
on call this week.
NEW YORK. Sept. 10.â As a result
largely of further r^nt taking, stocks
moved rather irregularly to-day,
though the undertone was undeniably
firm. The tendency of many issues
vas toward a higher level. Indeed,
several of the more active issues, such
as United States Steel preferred and
common, touched new high records for
the present movement. Business for
the brief session was unusually heavy,
though not widely distributed. South
ern Railway was the feature of the
railway gToup in the early trading.
Later Union Pacific and other standard
railway issues became very strong, but
elsewhere In the list the activity \va.s
confined chiefly to the minor railway
and industrial shares. Â¦
The market wavered slightly on the
publication cf the bank statement,
which showed an unusually heavy in
crease in loans and a cash loss which
almost exceeded the highest. The grand
total of loans and deposits is now at
the highest in the history of the asso
ciated banks. Reports that the Gov
ernment report on corn would be quite
reassuring added stimulus to the list
in the final trading and the closing was
quite active and strong in spite of*
further heavy profit taking. A very
substantial advance in Colorado Fuel
was accompanied by many specific ex
planations.
Total sales of bonds. J3.S75.OOO.
The action of the stock market dur-_
ing the week has reflected speculative
cor.flflence and even enthusiasm. The
number of chares sold rose to near
1,000,000 on several days and the ad
vance for the week has been quite com- :
prehensive, but not very great. The !
tone of the market has been good (
throughout and the realizing was well i
taken and opened the way in many j
ca^es for fresh advances. '
By a series of shifting operations the ;
whole list nearly has been included in j
the operations of the powers in con- ]
trol of the market and the sustaining !
influence of the new points of strength i
has proved sufficient to enable the tak- I
ing of profits without materially hurt- ';
ing the price value. The bulk of busl- '
ness seemed to come from firms cred- i
Ited with operations for speculative j
commissions of large capitalists and
the general commission house business
has been small. The board-room ele
ment has maintained a skeptical atti
tude toward the advance and has been
Constantly on the- watch for its cul- i
.mination and reaction.
Their short selling and later forced \
covering have been factors in the oc
casional halts and the later renewed
advances. Selling was conspicuously in j
evidence on Tuesday after the three- j
day holiday interval, during which the i
bank statement was published, show- j
ing an abrupt change from the long ex
tended rise in the surplus reserves of Â¦
the banks. But this selling was ab- j
Borbed with confidence and served to i
reassure the doubtful and withhold of- I
ferings from the market, thus facili- j
tating the advance. Specific news to ac
count for the rise has been as conspic
uously lacking as at any time during!
the movement, but several features In \
the general situation were accepted as j
encouraging to prices. j
Little attention was paid to crop '
news. Crop prospects were regarded j
as being not materially altered during Â¦
the week. The iron and steel trade was j
a subject of constant discussion. Belief â¢
In a revival of the iron trade was an I
effective influence on the whole market, j
Of elmllar effect was an evidence of a j
growth In railroad traffic. Last week's j
train movement was greatly improved, j
and officials of "Western railroads as- !
eerted that the Eastern movement of .
merchandise showed a large growth '
and augured a feeling of confidence in i
the mercantile community. ;
The decision of the Pennsylvania to '
restore the full working time in Its!
â¢hops will affect 20.000 workingmen, !
and was regarded as highly significant !
cf better conditions, and the New York !
Central's Increase in gross earnings for j
August was viewed in the same light.
The agreement arrived at over the
*rage dispute in the New York traction j
field and the formal abandonment of j
the meat etrike lightened the labor sit- I
cation from a stock market standpoint.
There was a slight hardening of the j
money market In rsponse to the decline â¢
In the surplus reserves of the banks, I
the Interior demands to be faced and j
the more active demand for money for j
several purposes in the stock market, j

When the case of Nguen Lun,
charged __with murder, was called In
Judge Lawlor's court yesterday to be
set for trial Attorney Hiram Johnson,
for the defendant, asked for a contin
uance of five jveeks, as other engage
ments would prevent him taking part
in an earlier trial.
Attorney Carpenter objected to a
long continuance, alleging that some
of the witnesses for the prosecution
were, ready to testify that they had
been threatened with death and bribes
had been offered to others to leave the
jurisdiction of the court before the
trial. One of the important witnesses
for the prosecution had â¢ disappeared
since the trial and conviction of Quon
Quock Wah. v .
Johnson pointed out that the case,
had been in court for over a year and
special counsel for the prosecution
had got a continuance for two months
to enable him to go East. He char
acterized the statement of threats and
bribes as absurd and said that all the
witnesses were in court and no doubt
would be there when the case was
again called for trial.
The Judge said he hoped Johnson
could make his arrangements so as to
have an early trial, and he would con
tinue the case till next Saturday in
order to give_ Johnson time to rear
range his engagements if possible.
It was during Nguen L.un'3 trial re
cently that proceedings were stopped
when one of the jurors, David J. Kel
ly, Informed the court that Edward
W. Gunther, an attorney, had at
tempted to bribe him by giving him
$200 In gold.. Gunther was in court
yesterday to be arraigned, but at the
request of his attorney, Samuel M.
Shortridge, a continuance was grant
ed for two weeks. Judge Burnett of
Santa Rosa will preside at the trial.
Nguen Lun is one of the Chinese
tong presidents charged with the mur
der of Tom Yick of the Chinese Edu
cational Society In May of last year.
Ten presidents were indicted by the
Grand Jury for the murder. Quon
Quock Wah has been tried and-con
victed, but a motion is pending for a
new trial and the other nine have yet
to be tried. :

turbing the peace, but as Mrs. Magee
showed reluctance to prosecute Judge
Cabaniss dismissed them with the
usual reprimand.
In the courtroom of Police Judge
Mogan yesterday morning Mate Mc-
Ewen reiterated his statement that he
saw three men leave the ship, and
Mate Mclntosh did not attempt to re
new his skeptical oratory. The Judge
took Mate McEwen's word for It and
dismissed the case.
So the two seamen buckled on their
revolvers and stole cautiously along
the silent deck to the forecastle, but
not a sign of any person did they dis
cover. Just as Mate Mclntosh was
ubout to chide Mate McEwen for his
apparently groundless fears the latter
mariner suddenly declared that he saw
two or three 'shadowy human forms
flitting shoreward across the gang
plank, and without more ado the
twain gave pursuit. Mate Mclntosh
Â«aw no cuarrjr ahead, but Mate Mc-
Ewen Â«worÂ« that three fleeing men
were plainly visible to him, and he
led his companion on until he saw, or
fancied he saw, the phantom trio en
ter a, water front saloon. "We hae
them now, sure!" chuckled Mat* Mc-
Ewen as he dashed Into the wet goods
store â to find It barren of customers
and the bartender calmly dozing. No
man had entered the place for half
an hour prior to the arrival of the two
niates, the mixologist declared, and
then Mate Mclntosh did epeak his
mind to Mate McEwen. He continued
speaking it after they returned to the
street, and it was his manner of
speaking it that attracted Patrolman
J. H. Helms to the 6pot and resulted
in the arrest of both mates for carry
ing concealed weapons.
It was seven bells In the second
watch aboard the British ship Port
Elgin. moored at Harrison-street
wharf, and First Mate John McEwen
paced the after deck alone, as the
other offlcers and the crew had gone
ashore for the x evening. Hearing a
noise forward. Mate McEwen Instant
ly bethought him of bay pirates, of
whose audacity he had been warned,
and while he was considering whether
It would be best to go and Investigate
or blow a whistle to summon the po
lice, he was gladdened to see- Second
Mate John Mclntosh come up the
g-angplaak.
"Hoot, mon, but ye're th' welcome
iic ht," said Mate McEwen to Mate Mc-
Ictocb. "Theer's saethln' oncanny
grangln' on forward, an' I'm Inclined
las think It's boorglars."
"Awa* wl ye," exclaimed Mate Mc
lnto*h- "Ye maun be daft tae think
boorglars wud mak' muckle noise. If
it's onythin', it's warlocks."
"Warlocks, naethln*," was Mate Mc-
Ewea's retort. "Warlocks dlnna gang
aroon as If they wur daeln' a cake
walk. Ainly a soopersteeshlous bairn
wud ae think o' seech a thing."
"Weel, we'll gang forward an* find

Edward F. Beach, a carpenter, has
neglected his wife and six-months-old
babe In such a shameful way that
Judge Mogan promised to give him six
months' imprisonment when he comes
up to-morrow for sentence. After aban
doning his family Beach went to Wood
land and there met a young woman
named Kate Collins, whom he brought
to this city and installed in his father's
house, and all the money he earned
was spent on his inamorata, while his
wife and babe were saved from starva
tion only through the kindness of her
mother's parents. Mrs. John Pettle,
manager of the Universal Service So
ciety, took up the case, and it was
through her efforts that Beach was ar
rested.
"You are about as contemptible a
fellow as I ever heard of," said the
Judge to the defendant after It had
been pretty clearly shown that the
Collins girl was Drought here by Beach
to contribute to his support, "and I
only regret that there Is not a whipping
post for the punishment of such char
acters as you. When you come here
again,* however, I will take pleasure in
sending you to the rock pile for six
months."

whom bad evidently been smoking the

so was Ah Wong, the proprietor of the
place, and in Judge Mogan's court the
quartet pleaded not guilty of vagrancy
âthe women weepingly, the man stol
idly. The police, however, told some
things concerning the defendants that
horrified even the court attaches, who
for years have been listening to un
pleasant stories of human degeneracy,

the case till to-morrow.
John Smith complained that he was

street lodging-house by John Â£2. Hall,

was no appearance for the prosecution,
and Bailiff Hickey went to the door
and lustily yelled, "John Smith!" Seven
men responded, but not one of them
was the John Smith who had signed
the complaint. .
"Case continued till next Tuesday,"
said the Judge, "and let a bench war
rant issue for John Smith."
"Am I to keep on arresting John
Smiths until I get the one that is want
ed?" inquired the bailiff.
"Next case," was the court's evasive
answer.
Miss Clifford denied ef erythlng that
Miss Davis had asserted, ' and offered
to bring any number of witnesses to
prove that she (Miss Clifford) had nev
er earned the nickname of "Rough
House Ruth." Nobody had ever ad
dressed her by that title, or even men
tioned it in her presence. The Judge
then told her to have her witnesses in
court next Tuesday.
MIes Annie Davis averred that in
the most select circle of lgwer Pacific
street society Miss Ruth Clifford is
invariably . alluded to as "Rough
House Ruth," an appellation aptly
bestowed, because Miss Clifford had a
seemingly unconquerable habit of act
ing In a disorderly manner when any
thing or anybody" vexed her. For in

of the dance .halls and Mlsa Davis
playfully invited the warrior to pur
chase a drink for her. Miss Clifford
promptly knocked down Miss Davis
and then pirouetted upon her face,
leaving some unsightly marks which
she would be pleased to have Judge
Mogan make a note of before they
disappear. She (Miss Davis) did not
consider the act Justified by the
provocation. She hoped she knew
how to deport herself without violat
ing the code of dance hall ethics, and,
although she hated to drag any one
Into court, she felt it vras her duty,
not only to herself but also to the
terpsichorean sisterhood, to have Miss
Clifford punished. As for being called
a cat by Miss Clifford, she could af
ford to consider the source and over
look the insult. She might have re
torted by informing Miss Clifford that
If she wanted to see a real cat she
should have consulted her mirror, but
repartee would be wasted on such a
creature. Besides, she hardlV had time
to say anything ere Miss Clifford had
her down and out.

Are we receiving less heat from the
sun? Returns have lately been made
to the Paric Academy of Sciences by
M. Dufour and M. Ladislas Gorczynski
which seem to show that such. Is the
case. M. Dufour dates a . marked
diminution, . beginning in December,
1902, and M. "Gorczynski reports that
it" began at Warsaw in May of that
year. Some observers are inclined to
ascribe the decrease of : solar radia
tion to the dust eiected from Mont
Pelee, others to the increase of sun
spots. It is improbable that solar ra
diation -varies - sensibly from year to
year; but the quantity of moisture in
the, air -differs from day to day. The
year 1879 was cold in England, not
because solar radiation was less, but
because the sky was nearly always
cloudy. We observe solar heat and
light at the bottom of an ocean of air,
the "changes . of which must have far
more to do with our records than al
terations on the sun's surface, stu
pendous as these are... Several coun
tries experienced a j hot year. In 1879,
though it was a .wet, cold one with us.

OAKLAND, Sept. ' 10. â Few young women
are able to keep so momentous a secret as an
engagement, but outside of the circle of Inti
mates not many of Miss Isabelle Kendall's
friends knew of her betrothal to E. Kenneth
Lcwden until her formal -announcement a few
days ago. Young Lowden hae been most.at
tentive for some time and Dame Grundy j has
been wisely nodding her head, but little did
she suspect that an elaborate trousseau was
already in course of construction and . that, the
devoted couule had even then . selected their
future home. In fact every preparation for the
wedding â which Is to be November 16 â was
complete before Miss . Kendall took the world
Into her confidence.

A highbinder murder, followed by an
attempt to burn the body'of the victim
In his cabin, has startled the people of
Irvington, and the constables of sev
eral townships are trying to find a clew
to the perpetrator of the .erlme.
Sing Kee,' a prosperous young
farmer, was found literally hacked . to
pieces in his burning cabin about.mid
night Friday. The flames attracted. the
attention of Nick Pahrelfall, on whose
ranch the Chinese had his cabin, and
he went to extinguish the fire. Look
ing into the cabin he saw Kee's % body
lying upon the floor. He drew the body
out ere the cabin was destroyed.
It was evident that the victim had
engaged in a terrible struggle. The
place was In utmost disorder. . The
man's head was â¢ nearly severed from
the body, and other deep gashes lndi-,
cate that a meat cnopper was the
Weapon used.
It Is believed that Kee 'made enemies
by his good luck at gambling and that
some, one whose money, he *had won
killed and robbed him.
The .murder may bring on a tong
war, , as Kee's tongmen will surely en
deavor to revenge his death.

Then Mrs. Huntley resorted to hose
and water. The son and heir of the
Huntley household was instructed to
attach the garden hose to the faucet,
and, as the statement upon which was
based the warrant goes, Mrs. .Hunt
ley directed the nozzle, while the
son and heir turned on the stream.
The trater succeeded where Mrs.
Huntleys orders had failed and Mrs.
Wright beat a retreat that was equal
to one of the great Russian move
ments. Drenched and angry Mrs.
Wright started off for the City. Hall
and swore out a warrant for the ar
rest of Mrs. Huntley. Mrs. Wright
gays that while Mrs. Huntley had the
water on her she is going to have the
law on Mrs. Huntley.
Then came the clash. The ladder
rested upon the Huntley property.
Mrs. Huntley ordered her neighbor
off the ladder and the ladder off her
property. The order was not obeyed
and Mrs. Wright went ahead cleaning
her windows. The order was repeated,
but the operation of cleaning the
Wright windows went calmly ahead.
The Huntleys and the Wrights are
neighbors. There is no record of
family disturbances up to this after
noon, but to-day the trouble came in
ehowers. Mrs. Wright wanted to
clean the windows of her home that
overlooked the Huntley property. In
order to do this she placed a ladder
against the house, mounted ' the lad
der and went to work with water and
a wilL
Mrs. Daisy Huntley of 613 Sixth
street was too free with a stream of
water from the family hose and now
she Is under arrest for battery, the
charge being preferred by Mrs. C. M.
Wright. It is true that Mrs. Huntley
denies the battery, but the heartless
police served the warrant that was
sworn to by Mrs. Wright, and the
question of whether turning a stream
of water upon a neighbor is battery
will have to be determined by the
Oakland courts.

1016 Broadway, Sept. 10.
Miss Clara Haggert testified that she
saw some of the articles on the bed
in the defendant's room on the , day
that Miss McNaughton was packing
her clothes to leave Mrs. Mein's em
ploy.
The examination was continued un
til Friday, September 16, at 10:30
a.m. â¢
"I do not," answered the witness/"
"And you never saw any of these
articles in the possession of the de
fendant?"
"No. I did not."
Charles Kydd, an employe of Taft
& Pennoyer, appraised the stolen
property at about iZO.
â¢"You do not know, except on hear
say, that Grace McNaughton ever had
any of this property ; in her- posses
sion?" Attorney Frick asked Mrs.
Mein.
Mrs. Mein In response to questions by
Attorney Baker stated that last April
she employed the defendant as a
servant, and a few weeks afterward
she missed several articles from - her
wardrobe, pome table linen and a num
ber of pieces of bric-a-brac. She noti
fied the Chief of Police, who detailed
Detective Shorey on the case, andean
investigation by the latter resulted in
fastening suspicion on Miss McNaugh
ton.
"Did you ever order the Chief of Po
lice to offer the girl freedom from pun
ishment if she would confess 7" asked
Attorney Frick.
"I did not," answered the witness.
"I offered no inducements to her, nor
to the Chief. At my house she said
she had taken the things." -'."
The answer was stricken out.
After all the property had been
Identified by Mrs. Mein she told how
she had recovered it. "These articles
were returned* to me. by Mrs. Law
son," answered the witness, "who
seemed to know where all my things
were and she was wearing a piece of
the jet on. her hat. I then called up
Chief Hodgkins and had : all the. ar
ticles laid out when Detective Shorey
called, and when he saw them he
laughed and said he wished- he was
in the swim, too. Then he brought
Grace McNaughton to see me. I
asked the Chief to arrest Grace, but
he refused, saying that I ought to
wait awhile. I Insisted that he arrest
her, as it had been shown she stole
the property. Still he refused to do
so."
Miss McNaughton was represented
by Attorney A. L. Frick, while District
Attorney Allen and Attorney George
W. Baker, counsel for Mrs. Meln, ap
peared for the prosecution. The girl
was accompanied by her sister, Mrs.
Kate Ramsey, and Mrs. White, .the
wife of Deputy. Sheriff Peter White.
She was very pale from the effects of
her recent illness, and her pallor was
heightened by contrast with her black
dress and hat-' Aside from a slight ner
vousness at the opening of the trial she
showed no trepidation.
The confession obtained by Chief of
Police Hodgkins ' from Grace Mc-
Naughton, who. is charged with grand
larceny by Mrs. Thomas Meln. was
ruled out at the preliminary examina
tion of the accused, which began this
morning before Justice of the Peace
James G. Quinn. The Judge made his
ruling under a decision of the Supreme
Court to the effect that a law officer
who has given advice to a person ac
cused of crime in order to obtain evi
dence has no right to testify against
that person. In response to the ques
tion of District Attorney Allen, Chief
Hodgkins said â¢ that he had advised
Miss McNaughton to make a clean
breast of the matter.

The Garden City Cyclers of San Jose
won the fifty-mile championship relay
race yesterday, the feature event of the
second day's racing at Ingleside track,
under the auspices of the California
Associated Cyclists. A fair crowd as
sembled to cheer for their dubs. The
day was marred by a strong, chilly
wind, which blew down the homestretch
of the course and made pedaling a
strenuous task for the riders. The time
of the relay was 2 hours and 45 min
utes. Only two clubs entered, the Gar
den City Cycler* and the Reno Cyclers'
Club. Each club was represented ,bÂ»
ten riders, each of whom had to ride
five miles.
The man who rode the first relay for
the Reno club 13 probably the cause of
their, defeat. J. P. Berryessa, the Gar
den City man, succeeded in leaving him
more . than half a mile behind at the
end of the flnÂ»t five miles. The Reno
men rode gallantly from then on and
succeeded in cutting the lead down so
that when the end of the fifty miles
was finished they were less than a
quarter of a mile in the rear, with
Knox, -their final courier, riding des
perately and gaining on his opponent.
The opening event was a two-mile
race for men who had never started. In
the final heat C. Johnson of the New
Century Club defeated H. Stander
wick.
A three-mile motor race, which was
won by A. Yonge of the New Century
Club, proved uninteresting.
The five-mile motor race was easily
captured by C. McCormick of the Cali
fornia Cycling Club.
Following are the winners and the
time made in each event:

Professor Ward observes that tuber
culosis in fowls exists extensively
among many large poultry ranches In
this State, but it seldom kills enough
fowls at one time to excite the alarm
of of the owner. Its existence in a
fleck constitutes *~ a steady drain,
though- it fails to attract much atten
tion, * because the losses are so . evenly
distributed In point of time. In the
first outbreak ' of the disease brought
to the attention of Professor Ward the
owner lost 250 fowls out of a* flock of
1400 in one year, . indicating that the
disease is distributed broadly enough
now to demand the serious attention
of poultrymen.
Professor Wand finds tuberculosis to
be an infectious disease caused by or
ganisms known as tubercle bacteria,
which enter the body of the fowl and
multiply there. Infection is trans
mitted principally through droppings
into the food from tuberculous
chickens. There Is no evidence to In
dicate that tuberculosis is spread
through the egg, though it is possible
that this may be so.
There ,1s no, known remedy for the
cure of tuberculosis in fowls, any more
than for the disease in man. Killing
Is the only real preventive and this
should be done soon as the disease
manifests itself.* The disease can only
be controlled by measures designed to
keep the healthy fowls separated from
the diseased ones and perfect sanita
tion, spraying the roosting-houses with
disinfectants and keeping the young
pullets a\f ay from -the affected stock
or from land recently occupied by the
latter.
Tuberculosis in fowls is not a mat
ter that intimately concerns the public
health. This conclusion has been
reached by Professor Archibald R.
Ward, professor of veterinary science
and bacteriology at the University of
California, after an exhaustive exami
nation into the question of the prob
ability of the transmission of the
germs of Consumption from fowls to
man. In a bulletin issued at the uni
versity to-day Professor Ward sum
marizes his conclusions in the follow
ing language: â¢
The subject of relationship between
tuberculosis * in man and cattle and
the disease in fowls is full of interest.
Tuberculosis in cattle is prevalent In
the same district In which -the disease
In if owls occurs, and examples of
tuberculosis in both cattle and fowls
on the same ranch have been observed.
Attempts to transmit the disease from
man or cattle to fowls have . usually
failed. Successful transmission of the
disease to" 1 fowls from man or cattle
has rarely been accomplished. Cattle
are found upon but a very small per
centage of the poultry ranches, and in
consequence the question of the pos
sible transmission of the disease from
cattle . to fowls is relatively unim
portant.
"Tuberculosis in man is not notice
ably prevalent in j the community
where- most cases of the disease in
fowls, have been found, for it is not
frequented by consumptives in search
of favorable climatic conditions. The
possibility of the transmission of tu
berculosis from poultry to man is a
matter concerning which it Is exceed
ingly difficult to collect evidence. The
fact that chickens, when eaten, are al
ways well cooked indicates that there
is practically no danger from that
source. It has not been proven that
tuberculosis is transmitted through
the egg, and furthermore, most eggs
are well cooked when served. ! It does
not appear therefore that tuberculosis
in fowls Is a matter that very inti
mately concerns public health." '

Mayor Warren Olney has decided
that property belonging to the city
should not be sold, no matter what the
conditions surrounding the sale. This
general principle of municipal owner
ship was announced by the Mayor to
day, when he vetoed an ordinance by
which the city sold to P. McDonnell a
small portion- of the land upon which
the'Alden firehouse stands. By this act
Mayor Olney has laid down a rule of
city government that affects every mu
nicipality in the State and which will
become a precedent that is likely to be
quoted for years to come.
The property involved is a smallV
shaped piece that jutted into a lot
owned by McDonnell, and the City
Council passed an ordinance selling this
section to him for $64 in order to
straighten out the property lines of his
lot. Mayor Olney to-day decided that
it was against public policy to sell any
city property, and vetoed the ordinance,
distinctly declaring that it would create
a bad precedent. He also asserts that
the City Council cannot sell property
without advertising for bids, which was
not done in this case.

1016 Broadway, Sept. 10.
In the afternoon while the spectators
were waiting for Bell to arrive a spe
cial exhibition doubles match was
played. In it the Hardy brothers were
pitted against Percy M unlock and Will
Allen. The former champions played
almost as well as ever and Murdock
and Allen were outclassed. The latter
won the third set,- but the first, second
and fourth sets went to the Hardys.
The score was 6-0, 6-3, 1-6, 6-4. *
The four. Sutton sisters will play ex
hibition matches on the Golden Gate
Park courts this afternoon at 2 o'clock.
Those -who were unable to go to- San
Rafael will be given an opportunity to
see the greatest lady tennis players in
the country In action. Â¦Â¦
The men's consolation doubles and
women's consolation singles were also
finished. In the former Stewart Gay
ness and John Donnell took first prize.
They beat Herbert Long and Carl'Gar
dener in the finals after losing the first
two sets. The score was 4-6, 2-6, 7-5,
6-1, 16-2.
In the other consolation event Mrs.
Hendrick and Mrs. Seymour met in the
finals and the match was as fast and
interesting : as any In which the young
er ladies participated. Mrs. Hendrick
lost the first set and looked to be beat
en in the second, but she stuck gamely
to "it and finally won out. The score
was 4-6, 8-6, 8-6.
The challenge match of the men's
singles in the tennis tournament was
not completed yesterday and the cham
pionship is still undecided. Champion!
Bell was delayed en route from the
East and did not arrive at San Rafael
until after 4 o'clock. At 5:30 Bell was
on the courts and playing. He was
tired from several days' travel, but
when the committee decided to play
the match he was too good a sports
man to protest.
Two sets were played before dark
ness came to Bell's rescue. MacGavin
played better than he ever did before
in his life and the champion lost both
sets. It , was an uneven contest with
MacGavin at his best and Bell tired
and in poor shape to play. After the
first two ga^mes MacGavin was con
stantly in the lead. He drove and
chopped to perfection and kept the
balls close to the net. On the other
hand, Bell was off on his volleying and
seemed unable to get started. Had the
match been finished yesterday Mac-
Gavin would undoubtedly have won In
straight sets...
The score stood 6-2, 6-3, In favor of
MacGavin when the match was post
poned until Monday morning at 10
o'clock.' With a lead of two sets
"love," MacGavin is almost sure to win
the championship. The tournament
committee undoubtedly made a mis
take in ordering the match played yes
terday. It. was hardly fair to the cham
pion, considering the delay was in no
way his fault. , . â¢ ,
The ladies' doubles and mixed dou
bles were completed yesterday and
brought out two of the prettiest
matches of the week. . Miss Gabriel
Dobbins and Miss Florence Sutton won
the ladies' doubles championship, rat
ing Miss .Violet Sutton and Mrs. Bruce
in the finals.
Miss Violet Sutton and Trowbrldge
Hendrick carried off the honors in the
mixed doubles. In the finals they beat
Miss Florence Sutton and Fletcher El
liott. The match wentsto the winners
In straight sets, both of which were
8-6. In the first set Miss Sutton and
Elliott overcame a lead' of 5-1, but lost
the set. The second set was equally
close and there were numerous exciting
rallies.
The match in ladies' doubles was the
most interesting of the kind - ever
played at San Rafael. It was also one
of the best uphill fights on record. Miss
Dobbins and Miss Sutton lost the first
set. In the second and third sets the
score was 5-1- against them. They
pulled out both the sets, the score of
the second being 10-8 and the third 8-6.
In the last two sets Miss Dobbins did
some remarkable driving. Miss Viofet
Sutton did some excellent volleying and
won many aces. The score was 4-6, S-6,
8-6. Â¦ -v>:^;' : - ' â¢

Balancing himself on the top round
while his companion firmly grasped his

Other firemen had taken positions on
the ladder by this time and the rescued

their dangerous position.
NEW TORK. Sept. 10.â More than a
wore of women and children were res
cued from a fire in a five-story tene
ment-house at 501 Tenth avenue early
to-day. The blaze started under a
stairway on the second floor and spread
quickly to the roof.
One woman â¢was confined to her bed
by illness and the flames had reached
ber room when a fireman stove in the
window and carried her down the fire
escape. Her husband and children, who
had remained in the flat, were carried
down extension ladders by the firemen.
So quickly did the' flames spread
through the tenement that the families
living above the second floor had no
time to gather their clothing.
Twelve families occupied ths second
and third floors, and all had narrow
escapes, losing everything they
possessed. '
The most sensational rescue of the
fire was when a mother and two chil
dren were taken from the ledge of a
fourth-story window. It was made
after a conspicuous show of bravery
and resourcefulness on the part of two
ladder men. The woman and children
had been driven from their apartment
by the flames and were clinging to the
ledge crying for help when the firemen
arrived on the scene. When a thlrty
flve-foot ladder was thrown up against
the side cf the burning building it fell
four feet short of the fourth-story win
dow. There was no time to make a
change and the two men rushed up the
ladder.

"Prince Sviatopolk-Mirsky's appoint

pression throughout Russia. His past
career has enabled h'â to become ac
quainted with the needs of the nation,
regardless of religion or race. Let us
hope that the new Minister is destined

velopment of the empire."
ST. PETERSBURG, Sept. 10.â The
Russian press unanimously approves
the appointment of Prince Peter
Sviatopolk-Mirsky as Minister of the
Interior. All the papers speak of the
critical character of the present situa
tion and express the opinion that the
selection of such a man as Prince Peter
will do "much to relieve the internal
conditions. The Novoe Vremya, in an
editorial, summarizes the general tone
of the press as follows:
"We are now passing through an his
torical crisis which may influence the
destiny of the Russian empire. As the
military situation in the Far East be
comes more complicated an opportunity
is offered to our enemies at home, who
are always quick to take advantage of
reverses experienced by the Russian
National Government. Therefore, we
must show hearty co-operation In the
hour of trial, repel our enemies
abroad and disarm the discontented
elements at home. In order to accom
plish the latter task we must retain
all the good, especially the two institu
tions which can develop only If al
lowed to work independently. Decent
relations must be the aim and one of
the first requisites, it is certain, will be
liberty of the press and freedom of
speech, which are the lightning con
ductors of public opinion. Prince
Sviatopolk-Mirsky's knowledge of pro
vincial life and his humane attitude
are the best guarantee of his success."

Poker games have run frequently in
the past at the New Western Hotel,
and Joe King has embellished his
comfortable bank account with shin
ing double eagles on various occa
sions, for Joe understands the funda
mental principles of poker playingâ at
least he did before five men sold him
a few dozen packs of cards, registered
later at his hostelry, got him into a
pame of poker that lasted for five
days and pocketed $4000 of Kfing's
hard-earned money. ,N
This bunko game was one of the
smoothest that has come oti in San
Francisco for many days. About two
weeks ago a card drummer dropped
casually into the New Western, en
gaged a room and bought the affable
King several wet dishes. He was sell
ing cards â best made, durable and fine
to the touch.
"Yes, weuse cards once in a while
here," said King.. "I'll take three dozen
packs."
Eight days later five men, some
colonels from Kentucky and -some
other things from other places, reg
istered at- the hotel. They didn't know
one another. That night King was
looking for the customary little game.
He found five willing hands. During
the following , days and nights . the
game was faEt and furious. King won
once in a while, but generally one of
the other fellows Juet beat him. If
Joe would draw to a straight and fill,
Colonel Nomdeplume showed down
four of a kind. Joe King's arm is now
slightly paralyzed from constant dig
ging into the cash pocket.
â¢At the end of five days King dis
covered that he was $4000 to the bad
and almost simultaneously that the
cards were all marked. The work wa&
clever. Each card had a mass of scroll
work on- the back. On the upper right
hand corner, either way, was : a groove,
faintly^ cut but not impalpable to the
touch. The ace had one groove, the
king two and so on down the line.
Many curious little rgrooved emblems
of the downfall of the 'Unsophisticated
had their place on the corners of the
pasteboards. ;: -
King notified Captain Martin and
ottered him half of the $4000 if he
could get it back. Barney Conlon,
clerk in Judge Cabaniss' court, with
Detectives Ryan and Taylor, spent the
night at the New Western 1n the hope
of getting some of the crooks. King
said that two of them were still at
the hotel, but they did not show up.
The police and King refused to talk on
the subject or give the names of the
men wanted. Detectives Ryan and
Taylor have good descriptions of the
men and hope to get them soon. It is
said, by the police that the same five
crooks have been operating extensive
ly elsewhere.
At an early hour this morning the
detectives arrested one , of the alleged
crooks who bunkoed King. The man
was caught at the New Western Hotel.
The police refused to give his name or
any dther Information about the case.
Joseph King, card expert and pro
prietor of the New .Western 'Hotel,', has
been victimized to the extent of near
ly $4(KK) durinsr the last five days. King
has long enjoyed the name of being
one of the shrewdest local dealers of
cards in 'a poker game. San Francisco
is not a mining camp, and gambling
is against the lawâ at least that's the
way the law reads â Cut a "friendly"
little, game can be found at anytime
in almost any back room of the hotels
about town. - ' â¢ .

REBUILDING FOOD.
Sonic Won&crful Things Food Can Do.
What continued use of improper
food will do by upsetting the nervous
system seems almost beyond belief
and it's just as surprising to see how
a simple chanpe from poorly- selected
food to good nourishing food will end
ail of these ails. A Chicago man says:
"My nervous system became so
rhailf-red that whenever I looked at a
moving object my right eye turned out
to the side, my speech was sputtering,
th<Â» memory was poor and I was very
absent minded. My face was covered
with pimples and I was constantly
ashamed of my appearance.
"The doctors said my blood was In
a bad state and I took medicine for
this for a year, but only pot worse. I
van so completely disgusted with
everything I was tired of living, al-
though 1 had no cause to be as far as
friends and home were concerned.
"When medicine failed I tried eat-
irj? only the plainest foods, bilt this
get tiresome and I did not seem to get
enough nourishment until in my ex-
perimenting I g.ive the food called
Grnpe-Xut* a trial. This seemed so
different from the, rest, it seemed
crisp and full of nourishment and 1
ate it with cream for breakfast as well
as dessert after the other meals.' Al-
most immediately my nerves began to
set stroncer and steadier and sounder
and I felt as though a great change
was coins; tm within me.
â¢The first effect I noticed wa*-my
risht eye did not enem so loose in my
head. I could look without seeing
double. an<2 then I noticed that I took
more .interest in life and was -not such
a chronic kicker, my memory lm-
pruvert. physical endurance was great-
er and iny sleep sounder and refresh-
ing:. '** 'Â¦
*'In a year's time I had recovered
entirely from the old absent minded-
ness, my complexion had cleared and
left me without :my more pimples
upon my face, all the old trouble with
the Â«-y e is cone for good and, to cut
the list short, why. I have a sound
wrvouR F.vsiem. am stronger and

men of a curious Australian bird,
known as the frog-mouth. It Is a queer
looking bird, and with its mottled
plumage and Quaint postures it has
rather the appearance of an old tree
stump, as it stands motionless on its
perch. It is of nocturnal habits and
if disturbed during the day it takes
its heavy flight to a neighboring perch,
and immediately drops off to sleep
again. One of the most characteristic
features of 4 this bird (podargus) is its
enormous mouth. Its great round eyes
give it something of the look of an
owl, which, indeed,, in other respects,
it closely resembles. It feeds upon

A new form of combustible, known
as. "osmon," has been lately, produced
in Europe from' raw peat. Of the 90
per cent water which the peat contains
from 20 to 25 per cent is eliminated by
an electrical process. A direct current
is passed through the mass of the peat,
contained in a suitable tank. Under
the action of the current the water col
lects at the negative pole and flows out
by openings in the side oft the vessel.
In carrying out" the process the invest
ors use from ten to twelve kilowatt
hours a cubic yard of raw material.
The process lasts about an hour and a
half. The electrically treated peat is
then dried in the ordinary way and re
duced to smaller pieces in a crusher.
It is delivered to the trade in the form
of balls or - briquettes. The" heating
power of the new product is consider
able. No trace of sulphur is found and
it does not smoke or leave much cinder.

Sunshine is so rare in England that
the Government takes great care to
measure it. The official summing up
for 1903 as regards sunshine shows that
all districts In the British Isles, with
one exception, fell short of the average.
The exception was England northwest,
including Manchester, that curiously
had an excess of fifty-seven sunny
hours. In Scotland north, west and
east the deficit. was 81 hours, 48 hours
and 133 hours. England ' northeast and
east were short by 107 hours and 139
hours, while in England south and
southwest the deficit was 68 hours and
115 hours. The midlands were behind
by 98 hours. In Ireland north and

sunshine, but last year they -were 133

CONFESSION OF BUBGIiABY
DENVER, Sept 10.â The leaders of
the Western Federation of Miners de
clare that the alleged confession of
Robert Romain, the ex-convict, now
under prison sentence at,Topeka, Kas.,
implicating union leaders in two disas
trous explosions in the Cripple Creek
district, contains many allegations
which can easily be refuted.
"According to Romain's confession,"
said William D. Hay wood, secretary of.
the federation, "Davis., Kennison and
Parker, members of the Cripple Creek
District Union Executive Committee,
were with him In Cripple Creek on
June 6 when, as he says, the final ar
rangements were made for the . Inde
pendence depot dynamiting. As a mat
ter of fact, the* three union leaders
named were In Denver from May 23 to
June 8, attending the annual conven
tion of the federation.
"Romain says that McKinney was
one of the leading conspirators. The
absurdity of this statement must be
apparent to any one who will consider
that McKinney is the man who made'
a fake confession regarding the alleged
conspiracy to wreck the Florence &
Cripple Creek train.
"Romain was either hired to make
this confession or he is working a
bunko game on the Colorado authori
ties with the object of escaping a term
in the Kansas penitentiary for the
burglary he committed In Topeka. I
predict that he will not be brought
back to Colorado, but that our oppo
nents will use his statement as con
clusive evidence that- the federation
planned and perpetrated the dastardly
crime at Independence."

"Two million kegs, containing' 160,
000,000 horseshoes, are used annually In
the United States and Canada, approx
imately speaking:," said S. Im Martin
of Boston, who represents an iron man
ufacturing concern and was in New
York recently. ,..{
"That was about the number used
last . year Â¦ and all the hue and cry
about rubber shoes and automobiles
Is raised in the face of a constantly in
creasing sale of horseshoes. As a;mat
ter of fact, the use of rubber horse
shoes, which is confined almost alto
gether to the large cities, is. a help to
manufacturers. The sale of the old-;
fashioned shoe goes on increasing and
in addition to that the manufacturers
have an opportunity to make, the steel
portion of rubber shoes. All BO-called
rubber shoes have- a rim of steel in
them and it is usually a better metal
and cives the manufacturer a wider
berth for profits than the old-fashioned
shoe."â New York : Commercial.

The new steamer A. B. Wolvin has,
as expected, broken all cargo records
on the Great Lakes during the short
time which she has been in commis
sion this season. Her cargo record to
date is as follows: Nine thousand nine
hundred and four net tons, 1800 pounds
soft. coal Lorain to Duluth; 9727 gross
tons iron ore, Two Harbors to Buffalo;
10,569 net tons hard coal, Buffalo to
Milwaukee; 10,973 gross tons iron ore,
Escanaba to South Chicago; 9945 gross
tons Iron ore, Duluth to Conneaut. .
The Wolvin in her last trip to Con
neaut established a new unloading rec
ord for ore. Her cargo of 9345 gross
tons was unloaded hi four hours and
thirty minutes by "four Hulett clam
shell machines and four Brown electrl-.
cal machines working together. Tha
Wolvin arrived at Conneaut on Friday
night, but was compelled to wait her
turn until Monday morning. At 7:20
o'clock Monday morning the eight
buckets began working upon her and
at 11:52 o'clock the last bucket was
hoisted from the hold and the whistle'
of the big steamer signaled for a tug.
She had been completely unloaded
without any hand labor k whatever. NO
such work has ever been done : before
on the Great Lakes. The nearest ap
proach to it is the record of the James
H. Hoyt, when 5200 tons of ore were
taken from that steamer by the four
Hulett machines In three hours and
fifty-two minutes. The Hoyt, like the
Wolvin, has her hatches spaced 12-foot
centers.â Engineering News. 'TC&flj

Bteven B. Ayres, who plays golf some,
waÂ» telling a story the other day of a
caddie who carried his clubs at the new
course on Mount Pocono. The boy had
enatched a hurried lunch, consisting
principally of the great national viand
that Emerson ate for breakfast â pie. .
"1 aeked him what kind of pie he
liked best," says Ayres.
"Well," he replied. "I really likÂ«
pumpkin best, only it musses up my
ears so." â Exchange.

A movement is now going on among
English iron dealers to have warrants
issued in such form that they will cover
American iron as well as the grades
of English and Scotch iron against
which warrants are already issued. It
is proposed to establish another form
of warrant to be known as Standard
Foundry warrant, making a third \ in
the group of warrants of which the
other two already In general use are
known as the .Scotch warrants and the
Cleveland warrants. In â¢ this country
the warrant system is still in the stage
of development, although the progress
in the establishment of the system has
been much more rapid in recent months
than In previous years, but the ad
vantages of the system are generally
recognized in Great Britain and it is
admittedly desirable for producers to
be able to dispose of their iron by war
rant rather than by direct sale. Here
tofore American iron , that has been
shipped to England has been disposed
of without the instrumentality of the
warrant, and this has to some extent
at least, handicapped American pro
ducers In disposing of their iron on the
English market. Owing to this fact
the extension of the'warrant system hi
England to Include ' the product of
American furnaces will doubtless .be
welcome to American producers, but in
England the suggestion which is al
ready maturing Is not being received
with unanimous favor.
. Commenting on the ptan the London
Statist said in a recent issue: "It
seems like putting a weapon in the
hands of our foreign industrial com
petitors wherewith to beat us.. If they
choose to send us their iron to sell for
Â¦what they can get they are at liberty,
under our fiscal system, to do so. But
why should we provide them with the
means of obtaining from us as consum
ers higher prices than they have been,
and presumably will be again, willing
to accept as dumpers? The arrange
ment may be a good one for brokers,
but it seems to us distinctly a bad one
for the British Iron trade."
Suggestion That English Warrants Bo
Issued for It Favors American
Producers.

DEMAND FOR AMERICAN
IRON IN ENGLAND
At the beginning of the>present year
there were up for hearing in London,
\vhere such cases must be tried, 347
applications for divorce. , The total
number during this year may be twice
as large â a figure that will startle the
English moralists who are already con
cerned with the fact that while the
population has increased 61 per cent
since 1S57, when the divorce act was
passed, the number of petitions for an
nulment of marriage has .increased
more than threefold.
. Furthermore the number of separa
tion orders issued in accordance with
the act of 1895 has enormously, in
creased, amounting to more than 7000
in a single year. Perhaps this is the
most .alarming circumstance of all.
Figures, In fact, show as incontestably
as recent fiction, written by Anthony
Hope and others, that our British
cousins are following the same inister
path as we. The United States rec
ord, however, will not be easily sur
passed, for in thirty-four years more
than 700,000 divorces have" been granted
on this side of the water. Pre-eminence
in conjugal infelicity, or the external
evidences of it, remains with us.
Great Britain continues to be agfi-<
tated over the steady growth of the
divorce evil, though, of course, the
statistics for the United Kingdom look
petty as compared with those of the
United States, where about" 60,000 peo
ple annually go forth freed from the
bonds of wedlock, to be - living wit
nesses of the instability of the mar
riage vow under modern conditions.
In England the number of divorce de
crees granted is still j Comparatively
small.

REDDINQ. Sept. 10.â J. F. Morley, a
deputy Sheriff at Sisson, who was con
victed of vagrancy yesterday at Yreka,
and who announced at the, time. he
would fight the case to the highest
courts, came into court this morning
and was fined $150, which he paid.
"The sporting element of Sisson pre
ferred the charge of vagrancy against
Morley when he tried to rid the town
of some of their number. Morley's ap

SWEARS OUT WARRANT FOR. .
ARREST OF Wi H. PITTMAN
The Supreme Court established the
precedent yesterday that no tribunal
can go back on an Indictment by a
grand Jury. The question arose In the
case of William Kennedy,- who Is
charged with complicity in the mur
der of Policeman Robinson on Va
lencia street about two years ago. -In
accordance with the decision rendered
the mulatto \ must once more go to
trial.
- - Kennedy was convicted of murder
In the Superior Court on the testimony
of an accomplice. On appeal the Su
preme Court declared that there was
Insufficient evidence to warrant a con
viction, and a new trial was ordered.
When the case came up for hearing
the Judge of the Superior Court dis
missed the proceeding and discharged
the -prisoner, who was . Immediately
rearrested. Kennedy was subsequent
ly released on a writ of habeas "cor
pus. District Attorney Byington went
before the Grand Jury and secured the
reindictment of Kennedy on exactly
the same evidence that the Supreme
Court had declared Insufficient to con
vict. '
When' the prisoner was brought to
court again he was discharged and re
arrested. .In all he was discharged
nine times and' as often taken in cus
tody as he left the courtroom. His at
torneys appealed to the Supreme Court
to set aside the indictment The court
had already placed itself on record as
deeming the evidence insufficient, but
the. question to bÂ« decided was the
right of a tribunal to consider testi
mony given before the Grand Jury
with a view to reversing the action of
that body.
It Is held that this cannot be done
and Kennedy must answer to the
charge of murder once again. Unless
new evidence can be produced he will
never go to San Quentln, for the
State's highest tribunal holds him
technically guiltless on the facts shown
thus far.

"On the other hand. It is equally true

without discrimination. In the other
schools of the department until such

possible under either constitution or
statute, and children of Mongolian de

less separate schools for their educa-,
tlon are provided, with all the facilities
as to grade and curriculum provided for
those schools attended exclusively by
children of white parentage. (Ward vs.

"It follows that tha Board of Educa

Mongolian descent, and that when such
schools are established, with education
al facilities equal to other schools In
the same district provided for children
of white parentage, children of Mongo
lian descent 'must not be admitted to

"From the records of the Board of
Education \ learn that there Is now a
separate school, known as the Chinese
Primary School, to which Mongolian
children of either Chinese or Japanese
descent may be -admitted. .This is a
school of five grades and possesses fa

ADMISSION OF CHILDREN. <
City Attorney Long yesterday ren
dered an opinion that Japanese chil
dren or those of Chinese descent can
not be lawfully excluded from the pub
lic schools. The opinion was asked for
by the Board of Education In view of
the many applications coming from
Japanese children to attend the schools,
especially the Polytechnic High School,
where manual training is taught in all
of its branches. . ;
In support of his opinion Long quotes
from section 1662 of the Political Code,
which provides that every school must
be opened for the admission of all chil
dren between S and 21 years of' age re
siding in the district, but gives power
to Boards of Education ,. to establish
schools for Indian children and for
children of Mongolian or Chinese, de
scent, and in that event such* children
shall not be . admitted .to other schools.
The opinion says:
SEPARATE SCHOOLS.
San Francisco is considered by
Willis Moore, chief of the . United
States Weather Bureau, to be the most
difficult - forecasting station in the
country. McAdie averages better than
any other forecaster ; in the service,
according to the official records. . For
the last two years his predictions have
been absolutely correct a trifle .more
than nine times out of ten. That he
has his work at heart is evidenced by
the fact that he paid for weather
cablegrams "from Manila last ; week
when :hls. department would not In
cur the expense. ; â¢ .'
The hot spellvhaa gone Into history
and cool weather has taken its place.
Yesterday the temperature was down
to 56 degrees and the wind was high.
It is not: by any means certain that
these conditions will continue, how
ever, jfor a change in pressure below
the Tropic, of. Cancer may make , us
search once more for our straw hats
and summer garments. But Sari Fran
cisco Â¦ has Its fog again, and the evi
dence of this i may be secured readily
from the people of. the; Sunset district
and Carville.. McAdie's records show
that California has had plenty of hot
Septembers during the last fifty-five
years, and. he is' disinclined to prom
ise comfortable conditions for the. rest
of the month. He is , still puzzling
over the question of how his ; data told
him to '. predict cool weather for last
Wednesday, which was thÂ« hottest
dan San Francisco ever saw. Speak
ing of his notable error, he, said: . â Â»
"It ,was simply because I . did not
know enough. Certain conditions bring
about" certain effects, but we do not
always know all of the conditions.
We havÂ« no information about affairs
5000 feet above us, and yet a change
up there often upsets all our calcula
tions. Forecasting is not. unfortu
nately, an exact science, and our pre
dictions cannot be given with mathe
matical accuracy. We hope some day
to have sufficient data to be able to
tell the weather for. a whole Â»eason
In advance. Meanwhile wa have to
do the best we can with what we
have." -: , .. ".-.'.

While the small bay craft were crowd-

ly to await the shock of the swell from
the Milwaukee. But there was no
shock. The enormous [ steel hull glided

Dawson Warns People to Xot Come
Thei-e Expecting to Secure
Transportation.
SEATTLE, Wash., Sept. 10.â A spe
cial dispatch to the Post-Intelligencer
from Dawson, T. T., warns persons at
coast points not to attempt to enter
Alaska this fall expecting to catch
steamers at Dav.-son for the new Tana
na district and Fairbanks.
Five hundred people are now at Daw-
Bon anxious to go down the river to the
new camp, with no steamers available.
The steamer Light left Dawson yester
day for Fairbanks with a 500-ton cargo,
which yielded $25,000 in freight
charges.
The Northern Commercial Company
yesterday refused to send the steamer
Sarah, with a cargo yielding $25,000
charges and passengers down the river,
fearing the ice would close "before she
oould get back. Hundreds are going
cut la small boats from Dawson to
Circle, Intending to walk 250 miles from
there to Fairbanks.

| MILWAUKEE CO3IMENCES TRIP DOWN WAYS AS MISS MITCHELL BREAKS CHAMPAGNE BOTTLE.
, "Couldn't- have been more satisfac
tory," replied Mr. Scott as he smiling
ly accepted the congratulations.
It swelled into a mighty roar and
echoed back from the fleet of tugs
and bay steamers until the screech
ing steam whistles were put to shame
arid became a very small part of that
deafening volume of sound.
Down, down slid the great Milwau
kee, crushing, and bruising the tim
bers of her cradle. Her bow dipped
deep into the channel and rose, proud
ly spurning the wooden framework
that held her young bones -to Mother
Earth. Her. hull brushed aside th-s
plebeian flotsam of the bay and parted
its way toward the anchorage where
t#o minutes later this thing of a mo
ment's life lay still as death on the
quieth waters of the harbor.
The crowds moved homeward and
the official launching party hurried
toward their tugboat. A ." parting
whistle or two and the Sea King be
gan 'her return trip to the Mission,
where the automobiles awaited them.
The songsters from â¢ beneath the
platform, emerged to enjoy the sun
shine hum a strain or two of
their impromptu Â¦ song. The unro
mantlc t'owboat that does scout duty
for the Iron works began to get busy
that she might move, the newly chris
tened cruiser to deeper water, and
the Â¦ naval constructors went to figur
ing on sponsons, interior finish, guns
and all that dresses an; Infant warship
after her first bath In salt water.
Â¦ "Splendid ' success," remarked Con
structor Tawresy. .
Miss Mitchell was ready with the
ribboned bottle. Smash! . The wine
splashed against the 3tem with a pop
that would have made Ned Greenway
chuckle. For a moment there was
absolute silence, then a cheer arose
from the Milwaukee group on the
platform that gathered strength as
the cruiser slid down the ways and
the cheer was slowly but tremendous
ly augmented by the vast crowds in
side and outside of the yards.
words were out of the speaker's mouth
Miss Jeffrey touched the button, there
was a click fro hftfie baby guillotine,
followed by a brash of timbers^ a slow,
forward motion of the r>onderous mass
of fibs and plates and the Milwaukee
had started on her way to salt water.
THE VESSEL. LAUNCHED.
Fifteen thousand people lined the
shores of the bay outside of the ir6n
works entrance and \ climbed the rig
ging of neighboring shipping to get
a better view of the launching. Four
thousand employes of the works and
invited guests occupied positions at
the side of the ways. Police were
stationed In and outside of the yard
and Police Captain Spillane with half
a dozen policemen cared for the spe
cial guests who had tickets to the
platform on which Miss Janet
Mitchell of Milwaukee and' Miss Lily
Jeffrey, daughter of the vice presi
dent of the Union Iron Works, were
stationed to perform the f unctions of
christening the vessel. Miss Mitchell
held the red. white and blue ribbon
to which was attached the bottle of
champagne with which the cruiser
was baptized and Miss Jeffrey's finger
touched . the | button that released the
weight to strike away the last chock-
Henry T. Scott received the guests

Dickie was deliberate. The launching
of warships has become a habit with
him. Recent months show the record
of three monsters sent to their element
by the wizard of the plant, and along
side of the adjacent docks the Ohio,
California and South Dakota chafed
at their fender piles in the slow swell
and seemed to be waiting patiently for
the addition to the new fleet to join
them In a comfortable berth.
TIIOUSAXDS AT SCEXE.
But there was a more serious side to
all of this hilarity and shuffling of feet.
Down on the ways several hundred men
under direction of the master mechanic
of the shipbuilding .plant and Manager
George W. Dickie were figuring out the
mechanical problems that always con
front a successful launching. Every
man knew his place and worked with a
will to clear the first half of the chocks
and blocks and make ready for the
final blows that should release the cra
dle from the incline and send the big
ship gliding toward the water.
San Francisco's fame as a birthplace
for warships is as widespread as Mil
waukee's reputation for brewing beer.
This is what Ivanhoe Commandery,
Knights Templar, from the" Wisconsin
city, Eaid about it; , . .
Milwaukee was much in evidence on
the platform, at the ways and on the
fleet of tugs and steamers that dotted
the little cove outside of the Union
Iron Works. Under the bow of the big
cruiser that was launched yesterday
forenoon at 11:45 o'clock there was a
dense mass of enthusiastic humanity,
men and women of Milwaukee. Every
bench upheld a restless contingent of
dainty feminine feet. There was not a
chairâ not even a keg^left to stand on.
This is the way San Francisco put it.
Under the platform, craning their
necks toward. the dull red eyes in the
cruiser's bow, was another delegation
from Milwaukee. They were as merry
as the crowd aloft and much more mu
sical. Ever and anon the words of a
Jolly group of singers were heard above
the din of sledges:
Oh. here's to Milwaukee; "- â¢ â¢
"We're out for a lark-ee.
To all of us pilgrims efcs's dear.
Here's to the Milwaukee.
Her foes she will tnaul-kee.
Her hull will be floated in beer.

Sensation of Those Who
JIake the Daring Trip
Is Described as One of
Sharp Bodily Exercise
"The sensation," said Wood, "was
like traveling at terrific speed in a
motor carnage, with the addition of
feeling all the time the sensation of
sharp bodily exercise."
LONDON. Sept 10.â Sir Hiram Max
im conducted some sensational aero
plane experiments at Crystal Palace to
day. He and Metcalf Wood went up
to a height of sixty feet on a machine
â¢which attained a speed of eighty to one
hundred miles an hour.
"The experiments," said Sir Hiram,
"have shown that a well made aero
plane placed at a slight angle from the
horizontal and traveling at high ve
locity has much greater lifting effect
than has even been supposed."
El.cciaJ Dispatch to The Call.
SAN RAFAEL, Sept. 10.â The forest
fire which has been burning on the" Bo
linas Ridge for the last three days is
still raging, and hopes of checking the
conflagration seem dubious. The men
who have been fighting the fire since it
started are exhausted, and the cry from
the burned district is for more fire
fighters.
Sheriff Taylor, who has been working
with nearly 100 men, telephoned to San
Rafael to-day and directed Constable
Hughes to send every available man
to the scene of the fire, and to send
food and drink. Constable Agnew left
late this afternoon with a gang of men
to relieve some of Taylor's crew. The
fire is now burning down the Lagunitas
and heading toward the John Enos
Valley.
Pedrini Brothers, lumber merchants,
have over S00O cords of cut wood on
their place, and as the wood lies in the
path of the flames it will probably be
burned. Over 20,000 acres of brush and
fine redwood and spruce have been
devoured by the flames, and unless
the fire can be got under control much
more damage will be done.
The fire wa3 reported under control
this. evening, but when one of the fight
ers was asked over the telephone if the
report was true he replied, "Under con
trol nothing. Why, the fire is not in
one place; it's everywhere."
Many cattle have perished in the
flames, and all farmers for miles around
have gathered in their stock.
From reports received here to-night
the fire is now near San Geronlmo, and
the bridges of the North Shore Rail
road are In danger. It is reported that
the Mailliard ranch, near San Geron
lmo, is In danger of burning. E. Schmi
'dell of Ross Valley and William Kent
of Kentfield drove to San Rafael to-day
and tried to hire men to backfire up the
Cataract Canyon in case the fire
reaches those points.

FIRE IX MAKIN COUNTY.
Last night the camp was supposed to
be safe, but to-day the men quit work,
owing to a difference in the pay, which
was not the fault of the Warden or
Commissioner, but was apparently the
act of an employer to make capital out
of the critical conditions that demand
ed men. Twenty-five or thirty quit
and their action may insure the loss of
the camp.
Commissioner Hy Kron arrived this
morning: and at once commenced the
organizing of relief crews to go to the
assistance of the "Warden, and went
out on horseback to take charge of his
men. The flames are not so fierce in
tthe camp, but they creep slowly and
relentlessly through the dense under
brush. The fire will not injure the
magnificent trees, but it will leave the
ground bare and wasted. The fire in
the Berry Creek section is now under
control, and with the arrival of the
men. under Kron it 13 hoped it will be
brought under control. All other sec
tions are now out of danger.
BOULDER CREEK, Sept. 10.âDe
spite herculean efforts, the Governor's
Camp is doomed. The flames are now
within its limits.

Mr. B. Jones, southpaw, took it upon
himself to make a little presentation
to the Seals yesterday at Recreation
Park. His wondrous generous streak
was developed in a single round, the
â¢ fourth, when he made a donation of
the game. Had any one else been
twirling the elusive sphere Uncle
would just about have taken second
money for the fifth time straight.
Score â San Francisco 3. Oakland 2.
Mr. Barber was kept busy figuring
out how he was going to win. The
Commuters had him looking foggy in
the seventh spasm and all but broke
up the little engagement. Again in
the ninth it was gloomy for Barber,
but Devcreaux was good enough to
end the strife by fouling out to Irwln.
For three innings the game was one
of those that makes the fan happy.
Both pitchers were working like
slaves and their fielders wore eating
up everything that happened to skip
over the green diamond. The Seals
opened up the fourth with a rush
when Hildebrand hit to right and
Waldron stuck at first after Francks
juggled his drive.
Meany bunted both along and Jones
brought down the cheers of the fans
by fanning Irwin. The hardest part of
his task was thus accomplished, but
instead of pitching ball he walked
Leahy, Gochnauer and Anderson,
making a procession of two right over
the plate and practically fixing it for
keeps.
Van Buren'a double. Hlldebrand's
single and an out by Waldron put an
other to the good in the fifth. Oakland
did naught till the seventh, when
Dunleavy pushed one over the right
field fence and Kruger doubled to the
score board. Strelb advanced him on
an out and Stark brought him in
with one that raised over Van Buren's
head and soared out to the right gar
den.
The eighth passed without event.
Dunleavy started off in the ninth
again' with a hit bnck of second.
Kruger forced him and Strolb flew to
right. Then Kruger pilfered tho lone
base of the day. It was up to Deve.
reaux, but the best he had was a
high foul to Irwln.
Buchanan and Corbett will hook up
this mornin* on the Oakland dia
mond. Wheeler and Dr. Moskiman
have been appointed to throw the
slants against each other at Recrea

the Sacramento meeting. There are
several big stakes to be decided on the

$2000 each and quite a number that are
worth $1000. Ths California horses
should bring home a goodly portion of

It seems that when the Judges at
Readvllle took thÂ© Los Angeles driver,
Robert > Smith, from behind Sweet
Marie and substituted Alta McDonald
they did not do so because they thought
Smith was not trying, but because they
thought McDonald was a much better
driver, which Is true, as the latter is a
professional of the first rank, while
Smith Is an amateur, although a clever
one. The Readvllle judges announced
that they could not find a particle of
evidence which Indicated 'that Smith
had lost two heats for fraudulent pur
poses. The conversation which took
place in the stand when they called the
Los Angeles man up was as follows:
"Mr. Smith, the public seems dissat
isfied wkh your handling of Sweet
Marie in the two heats just trotted. As
we have viewed the race we believe you
are entirely honest and are trying to
win. Now if you are, would you have
any objections to Alta McDonald driv
ing your mare?" .,
"Judges," replied Smith, "I am try
ing to win and want to badly, but if
you believe Mr. McDonald can drive
Sweet Marie better than I can, why I
invite you to substitute him. The only
think I ask is that he try hard and
use his best judgment so he can get
her home first. I assure you, It Is my
ambition to win."
That was the conversation at Read
ville, but at Providence the following
week, after Sweet Marie lost two heats
in her race, the Judges there took
Smith out and put McDonald up and
he won the race with her. It is said
that the conversation at Providence
was aa Chesterfleldian as at Readvllle,
but the Providence judges set Smith
down for the rest of the year and
awarded McDonald $1000 out of the
mare's, winnings.
All this recalls the case of W. G.
Durfee and Sweet Marie at Salem, Or.,
last year. In the $2000 -stake at
Salem Sweet Marie won a heat in
2:1314 and was then beaten a head In
2:12% by Dr. Hammond. Durfee was
ordered to hand over the mare to an
other driver, which" he refused to do.
He was ordered from the track and
expelled, together with the mare.
This meant ruling off for life and Dur
fee appealed to the Pacific district
board of the National Trotting Asso
ciation, the members sitting in Judg
ment on the case being A. B. Spreckels,
Colonel J. C. Kirkpatrick and Captain
N. T. Smith. On the evidence sub
mitted Durfee was reinstated.
The presiding judge at Salem testi
fied that the Judges dM not believe that
Durfee pulled the mare, and took no
notice of such a thing until the secre
tary of the association came- into the
stand and demanded that another
driver be substituted. Hughes, the
driver of the winner of the heat, testi
fied that Sweet Marie was not steady
the first part of the mile and that his
horse outtrotted her. The evidence all
went to show that the judges had not
punished Durfee for anything they saw,
but on what they had been told, and it
was considered that the punishment did
not fit the crime. On the evidence sub
mitted they could not refuse to reinstate
Mr. Durfee. IÂ£ seemed strange that a
driver should pull a horse In a race for
the largest /purse of the year where It
was proven that he was not betting
against her.
J. R. Albertson, who developed and
helped sell for $15,000 the California
horse George G, 2:07%, has returned
from his Eastern trip. He says the
three-heat system, every heat a race,
will in all probability be the racing
plan adopted by all the associations on
the Grand Circuit In 1905. It has been
given several trials this year and seem3
to be perfectly satisfactory to owners,
trainers and the public. By this plan
the purse Is divided Into* three equal
parts, and there are three moneys in
each heat. A larger proportion is given
the heat winner than by the old plan,
but more horses win money.
It" is the best solution of the "lay
ing up" evil that has yet been de
vised. Many horsemen hope to see
the plan adopted by the Breeders' As
sociation on this coast next season.
Many of the owners whose horses
won at the State Fair this year have
not yet received the money due them.
Unless it is Daid within the required
thirty days some of the unpaid own
ers are threatening to have the State
association suspended by the National
Trotting Association under the rules.
They . say the association has been
prompt in suspending them for un
paid entrance. money in the past, and
they believe that sauce for the goose
should be sauce for the gander. Sec
tion 7, rule 51 of the rules and regula
tions of the National Trotting Asso
ciation reads as follows:

three stakes there was a large and an
enthusiastic crowd to-day at the Coney
Island Jockey Club course. Three such
stakes as the $25,000 Annual Champion,
the $7500 Great Eastern handicap and
the $3650 Westbury Steeplechase were
certain to prove of more than average
Interest While only four ran In the
Annual Champion, they were all good
homes, at least three being stayers,
while as to the other, Broomstick, it
was thought he could stay, though the
race proved to the contrary. -Under the
conditions Broomstick had', up 107
pounds, while Stalwart was carrying
115 pounds, Major Daingerfleld, which
won it in ,1902, 127 pounds and Afri
cander the same weight. Broomstick
was an even money favorite. Stalwart
won easily by four lengths from Daln
gerfield, although pulled up by Jockey
Redfern. Broomstick ran third, while
Africander was eight lengths away.

cap, the feature of the # closing day of
the second summer meeting. Incident
ally the son of Fonso-Lucasta broke
the track record of 2:19%. his time be
ing 2:19 2-5. It was a smashing race,
although the early; pace was slow.
Fonsoluca assumed the lead In the first
eighth', and-hugging the rail through
out never gave way .to anything else.
It was strictly a two-horse race. Bragg
laid within a length of Fonsoluca^ for a
mile. â¢ When straightened out for the
wire Bragg moved up alongside the po
liceman's horse, and the two were un
der a vicious drive all through the final
sixteenth. Mclntyre outrode Mountain
when 'the final test came and landed
Fonsoluca first by a head. '
After the finish of the fifth race,
which Big Ben won by a 'short nose
from Don Domo, one would have
thought the Futurity had been run, so
loud and bo long was. the cheering. The
supporters of each horse thought they
had won their bets.-hence the cheering.
Big Ben's stretch run was sensational,
as was that of Nannie Hodge. Both
horses made up ten lengths on Don
Domo from the head of the Btretch to
the wire, Nannie Hodge being beaten
only half a. length for second money.
Nicol rode four winners and one second.

Wheeling, W. Va., May 28, 1903.
Some years ago while at work, I fell
over a truck and severely injured both
of r.iy shins. Mv blood became poisoned
as a result, and the doctor told me I
wual.l have running sores for life, and
that ii thry were healed up the result
would be f at&L Under this discouraging
report I left off their treatment and re-
sorted to the use of S. S. S. Its effects
were prompt and gratifying. It took
only a abort while for the medicine to en-
tirely cure up the sores, and I am cot
dead as the doctors intimated, nor have
the cores ever broke out again. Some 1a
years have elapsed since what I have de-
scribed occurred. Having been so signally
beneCtted by its use I can heartily recom-
mend it as the one great blood purifier.

Chronic sores start often from a pitn-
plc, scratch, bruise or boil, and while
salves, washes and powders are beneficial,
the unhealthy matter in the blood must
be driven out or the sore will continue
to cat and spread. SÂ» S. S. reaches
these o!Â»l sores through the blood, re-
moves all impurities and poisons, builds
up the entire system and strengthens
the circulation. . S. S. S. is a blood
purifier and tonic combined. Contains

TO SAIL.
J. IT. Crllly. living at 321 Bryant
etreei, was in a water front saloon
rhowing how easy it was to knock out
aiiy professional pugilist if the other
nun knew just one little secret. Then
h*- went up to a punching bag that
v.as out of commission and hanging
on the wall and r>roceeded to let the
friends h*Â» had been liberally treating
into his little secret. He sailed into
the bag with an awful swing of the
right, and, his bare fist glancing on
tlu* leather ball, he almost drove him
self through the brick wall. At the
Harbor Hospital he was treated for a
badiy wrecked hand and wrist and
fractures of the metacarpal bones.
The secret Is still unrevealed.

passengers who were on their feet in
every direction. Mrs. McCSellan was
thrown violently to the deck and her

at the Harbor Uos:>ital she was re
moved to her home.

Among the vessels that .assembled
to' watch the first plunge of the Mil
waukee were the Caroline, the. Water
Nymph, the Monticello, the Active, the
Sea Fox, the. Sea King, the Unadilla.
the Government launch Alcatraz and
the yacht. Ollie. The Meteor of the
J. Michaels Launch Company? carrying
representatives of The Call staff, was
one of the first on the scene.
On the excursion boats were many
visitors 'from .'inland' States who " had
never seen a launching before; Fortu
nately at the' Union Iron Works they
had the opportunity- to view warships
in three stages of constructlqn. In the
yards" were the California' and the
Sototh Dakota; which had already
taken . their, first, plunge into the" wa
ters and : are i now; nearing ; completion.
The foretop of L the California 'Is al
ready 'erected. Â¦Â¦â¢ â¢â¢ â¢ â¢ - Â¦â¢ - â¢Â¦ Â¦
To those who had . never before seen
warships or shipbuilding the sight "was
an' object-lesson. On the ' way back
the visitors passed the New .York, iw
all her formidable Tieauty, white" paint,
glittering brasswork ". : and ". ominous
looking; guns jutting out; on all : sides.
; Then the strangers grasped- the^ idea
that 'some" day the helpless Â»red* Hull
that . they : had seen ' glide onto a mud
, The men took a firmer grip on the
ropes and the women cowered in the
cabin, wondering if salt water would
ruin their chiffons. For several min
utes the party waited in an agony of
suspense.
Then the ladies emerged f rom - the
cabin and asked J. Wise, "Where is
your old wave?" The man who knew
it all looked. reproachfully at the red
hulk resting peacefully on the mud
buttom, .then sought the seclusion
which the cabin always grants and
hid behind the oir tank.
FliEET OF S3IALL. CRAFT.
The crowd rushed for places of
safety. "You leave it to me," con
tinued Mr. J. Wise.. "I've .been to
launchings before. At the last one
a wave washed right over the. launch.
Hang on: .she'll be here in a minute."
As the red hull touched the water the
whistles of the small craft raised -a
pandemonium to welcome the new ar
rival. A band on the tug Active struck
up- "The Star-Spangled Banner" and
the crowds on the boats and along the
water's edge cheered enthusiastically.
"She's ahead of time. That's a good
way to start," said those who know
the lore of the sea.
The swell from the launching was
light. The Jonathan" Wise of one-party
of excursionists shouted to his friends:
"Hang on, everybody. Ladies, get into
the cabin. - This will be worse than a
tidal wave."
four and a half minutes ahead. of the
time set for her launching. She was too
early for the tug Slocum, bearing a
crowd of army and navy officers. A
minute before the Slocum swung round
the oil dock the Milwaukee was settled
comfortably in her resting place. Peo
ple on the other vessels made merry
at the expense of those on the trans
port service tug. "The Slocum come
slow," said the irrepressible punster.
GREET THE NEW WARSHIP.
One of the pleasing sights on' the
south drive of, Golden Gate Park yes
terday afternoon was an automobile
party, of which Miss Janet Mitchell,
who christened the. cruiser Milwau
kee, was the guest of honor.
Accompanying Miss Mitchell were
the Misses Martin. Millie and Madge,
and Miss Mitchell's sister: Harriet. An
old time friend of the ybuog ladies.
Colonel W. P. Harlow of New York,
escorted the party and manipulated
the "red devil", that made short time
of the distance between the park en
trance i and the Cliff House. Colonel
Harlow is not afraid- to - make fast
time with an automobile and- thfl
young ladles had almost as excitinr a
time on the ride as they had atltha
launching of 'the- warship.
â¢ Friends of the colonel â¢ say Ire can

PRETTY GIRLS OX ALTO RIDE.
Ships of the Milwaukee class: are
intended to fight or run away as oc
casion demands. Their guna-are so
placed as to give opportunity of de
livering a rapid, concentrated fire.
Forty officers and 631 men will man
the, Milwaukee when she goes into
commission in the navy.
The Milwaukee will have a normal
coal supply of about 9000 tons, with
a displacement of 9700 tons. Her
total coal capacity "Is lf,000~* Ions,
which is more than that of battle
ships of the Iowa or Indiana type.
1 In. length the Milwaukee will be
423 feet: beam, 66 feet; draft. 22 feet
6 Inches. Twehtv-two~ knots is the
contract speed.
"When armed the cruiser's battery
will consist. of fourteen 6-inch guns,
eighteen S-inch and eight 1-pounder
rifles in the secondary battery, with
ten machine ffuns. . â¢ Â«
The . Government appropriated $2,-
S25.000 for the construction of the
Milwaukee. She will probably be the
last cruiser built at the Union Iron
Works for some time, unless the cor
poration should be reorganized and
again be placed in active competition
with Eastern shipbuilding yards.
It was common comment among
the navy officers and visitors at the
Union Iron Works yesterday that it
would ill-behoove the Government to
allow so valuable a plant, and one
that has shown so much skill in build
ing shies, to be without contracts for
building sea-fighting machines.
"Acme of Naval Construction Reached
in Recently Designed Sea Fighters.
No more powerful vessels have ever
been designed in the protected cruder
class than the Milwaukee and her
contemporaries. Bulky armor has
given way to speed requirements and
fast-fight ingr Qualities. The acme of
naval construction was reached when
it was shown that the protection of
warships was as well . afforded by
water-tight compartments and ability
to keep out of the way of an enemy if
outclassed.

Fruitvale will be materially benefited by San
Francisco's expenditure of $17,000,000 for public
improvements.
i, WHY?
Because the money to be thus expended will
benefit mechanics, laborers and all classes of
business' men," ' giving them plenty of work,
good wages and business knd enabling them to
hÂ»ve a surplus with which to buy homes and
they can buy their homes ' here In Fruitvale
better and cheaper than any other place around
the bay, and for the following five reasons:
Firstâ They can own their own homesâ the
monthly payments being much less than city
rents; which have doubled In the past two
years. , .
- Secondâ Quick and cheap transportation to
San I Francisco; commutation tickets $3 per
month, j ; Â¦
Thirdâ The same advantages that art of-
fered In the cityâ namely, water. . gas. elec-
tricity, Â¦ sewers,- flne roads, churches and
schools:
Fourth â No ctty taxes, only â¢ Stats and
county.
Fifthâ Besides all the above. Fruitvale is
noted for her wonderfully flne climate, un-
, doubtedly the best around the bay; her fruits,
flowers and shade trees, and ber law-abiding
citizens make Fruitvale an Ideal place to live.
Our Hat Is so large and so varied In pries
that it would be useless to advertise the alf*
feren* styles and advantages of each separate
property. ! but Â¦ we -ran show youi 2-room, 3-
roora and on up to 10 and 12 room houses, and
at prices ranging from $500 to $20,000.. . Â» ;, -
Property bought to-day will, without doubt,
advance in price during the coming year suf-
ficient to pay. not only a good Interest, but also
to give rent free.
We feel that If you will call and give us the
privilege of driving you about Fruitvale that
you will decide, as many have done, to buy and
settle In Fruitvale.

On the same farm In Potter County,
Pennsylvania, are -two strong: clear
springs which bubble up out of the
white sand with great force, and about
three miles distant is another spring
of like character. If a chip were
thrown. Into ."each "of these and could
float on uninterruptedly to the sea
they would reach their destination
many , thousands of miles- apart One
is the 'fountain head of the Genesee
River, which flows into Lake Ontario
and finally, reaches the sea '"at the
mouth of the Gulf of- St. Lawrence.
The other is the fountain head of the
Allegheny River, which unites at
P.itteburg with the Monongahela to
form- the Ohio and reaches the sea
at the mouth of the Mississippi. The
third is the fountain : head of Pine
Ci-eek, which flows into the "west
branch of the Susquehanna and
reaches the sea at Chesapeake Bay.
Two River Heads.
The State has realized a considerable
sum from the timber on the farm, the
lumber for the houses also being ob
tained there. The sawmill workmen
are the, white convicts. Improvement
is noted at the farm not only in the
fertile fields and the money-yielding
crops but in the condition of the sur
roundings. The houses of the camps
are neat and clean. Artesian wells fur
nish running water in every house.
Each camp ' has its vegetable garden
and food is produced in profusion.
Free labor cannot complain of com
petition from the convicts in Missis
sippi. The demand for field la"bor by
the big, private ; planters is always in
excess of the supply and there Is never
a time: when the State's use of its men
either tends to reduce wages or come
into competition with the products of
free labor. â New York Commercial.
The State- of. Mississippi's experience
as a planter is being attended with
marked success and the farm at Parch
man has rapidly increased its cotton
production. Its able management and
direction are producing results. From
the original 14,500 acres of wild land
bought by the State at $6 an acre the
officers have developed a magnificent
plantation property that would sell for
$60 an acre. Already 6000 acres of the
vast tract have been cleared and put
under cultivation and 2000 acres of new
land stands ready for the plow.
Of the 1200 convicts under sentence
by the State 700 are quartered on this
farm. They are divided Into seven
camps, a .sergeant holding authority
over each. Last year the State pro
duced 2800 bales of cotton and this year
will more than double that amount. At
the beginning of the venture the State
had a number of convicts "farmed out"
on shares with private planters. A few
of these gangs are yet in the private
fields, but they are being brought to
the general farm as rapidly as possible
and in 1905 five more camps will be
added and the entire State Penitentiary
will be practically located at Parch
man. .

The great weight of storage batteries,
which is so serious an objection to their
use on passenger cars and smaller car
riages, is an advantage on switching
locomotives, as it gives necessary ad
hesion. Such a locomotive is being
tested in the yards of the Prussian
State Railway. Among its special
merits it claims that of always being
ready and that of costing less than
steam for irregular service. The bat
tery of 200 cells is charged twice a
day from a source. of constant current
of 110 volts. The total weight of the
locomotive is 59,000 pounds, of which
22.000 pounds is the weight of the bat
tery and 9500 pounds that of the other
electric apparatus.â New York Com
mercial.

Very little seems to be going forward
with concern to the origin of life itself.
The ' field, it is true, has been pretty
well cleared uj? for some new genius
who will tell us just how the living
machine is originally put â¢ together â
that is, how the living machine arises
without the agency of another living
machine. Nobodyâ at least nobody dis
tinguished as a biologistâ now believes
that life is. anything but a natural,
spontaneous growth or evolution or
genesis from non-living matter. We
say that ihe cell has in it the. potency
of all forms of life. May we not also
say that so-called dead matter has
within it the potency of life itself?
And, carrying the argument a step far
ther, may we not say that the so-called
elements of oxygen, hydrogen, nltro
jjen, carbon, sulphur, phosphorus and
so on, having in them the potency of
life, have also within them the potency
of consciousness?â that the difference
between man and so-cajl^d dead mat
ter is a difference not of kind, but of
quantityâ that a man is highly com
plex matter, intricately combined chem
ically and Intricately arranged me
chanically?âNational Magazine.

â¢This flag fell to Superr-Â«au McCoonse
and has been handed down in his fam
ily ever since. The flag is of flannel
cloth, made after the design of the
British flag of that day. It is hand
sewed and was made by the squaws of
Tecumseh's tepee. According to the
Indian legend it was in honor of the
three Indians who volunteered to kill
Tecumseh on that day or die in the at
tempt'that the three arrows appeared
on the issues of the silver coins after
that date. â Kansas City Star.
The night before the great /battle a
council was called. A man volunteered
from each of these tribes who took a
solemn oath to kill Tecumseh the next
day. The battle followed and Tecum
seh was killed. His followers attempt
ed to take his body down the river in a
boat that night, but the three watchful
enemies were too alert and surprised
the party. They failed to secure the
body of Tecumseh, but succeeded iti
getting the flag which was wrapped
around his body. It was cut with many
bullet and arrow holes.
Perhaps there are few who know why
there are three arrow heads on a silver
dollar, or, for that' matter, that there
are only three. There is an Indian le
gend as to how they came there which
is closely associated with the flag of
the Quapaw nation, now attracting so
much attention in the Territory build
ing at the World's Fair.
This flag is the property of Joseph
McCoonse. It has been handed down
from his great-great-grandfather, Su
perneau McCoonse. The flag was the
one carried by Tecumseh in his long
campaign and was taken from. his dead
body after the battle of the Thames.
In this campaign there were allied with
General Harrison the Peorias, Kaskas
klas and Piankashas. three nations that
once helped rule Canada, New York
and a part of Pennsylvania, the frag
ments of which are now gathered in
the Quapaw nation and all told num
ber fewer than 200.

These Zanzibar apples have reached
the enormous price of $100 each. They
are not large, probably containing ten
bites at $10 a bite. The apples have to
be specially ordered, for no caterer
would ever dream of keeping them in
stock.. .. '.**.
Custard apples are another expensive
luxury. They* can be purchased at
prices ranging from 75 cents to $25
each, according to quality, and, ac
cording to those whose judgment in
such matters is considered to be ab
solutely correct, must be eaten with
pepper and salt Two of the most fash
ionable fruits in the winter months are
muscat grapes and strawberries and
until the end of January the latter are
beyond the reach of people of moderate
means.
A member of Mrs. Astor's "600" not
long since went into a well known fruit
erer's in New York and offered $250 to
the manager If he could provide enough
strawberries for five people that even
ing. The manager undertook to de
liver the fruit within seven hours and
then promptly proceeded to wire forty
different fruit gardens within thirty
miles of the metropolis for strawber
ries. Seventeen gardens provided the
required amount of strawberries, Â¦ the
remaining twenty-three not being able
to produce a single one, and by 6:30
o'clock that evening the fruit was de
livered at* a cost of nearly $2 50 for
each strawberry.
There are several persons In New
York whose weekly bill for grapes at
this season runs to never less than $100.
They pay $5 a pound for the best mus
cat grapes and receive at least three
pounds a day.
The manager of a well known fruit
erer's establishment recently declared
that many people who see high priced
fruit In the window will buy it Just
to see "what it tastes like," and in this
way these "samplers," as they are
called by the trade, are a considerable
source of profit to many of the ; high
class fruiterers. These samplers will
cheerfully spend a dollar on an apple
or a pear to enjoy # the experience of
eating such a luxury. â Baltimore Sun.
Of all fruits Zanzibar apples are per
haps the rarest. Dozens of trees to
gether will only bear a few of these
apples and the time of picking them
has to be carefully selected. They must
be gathered just a month before they
would ripen, otherwise they will quick
ly spoil. . â¢

A WAY TO HEALTHâ Home treatment for
mothers and daughters. An electrical and
mechanical engineer writes: "My wife suf-
fered with womb, kidney and bladder trouble
and Indigestion for three- years. She was
treated by physicians' without relief at an
expense of several hundred dollars. She be-
came a comDlete invalid; confined to bed
seven months. I tried' almost all the rem-
. edles I could hear of; found no relief until
with the use of Viavl 6he began to Improve;
In three months' time was shopping and is
, now restored to good health. I believe it to
be the greatest remedy on earth. In writing
this to you I have no other interest than to
express my heartfelt thanks to Viavl. It is
my honest Judgment that when used accord-
ing lo directions and for a reasonable length
of time. Viavl is the greatest blessing to
sufferers." Booklet containing Information

Cheese is still in a most unsatisfactory con

with a poor demand.-
The Butter market showed- no material
change yesterday. Some dealers reported
more activity in trade, which cleaned them
up of fine goods, while others reported the
market still dull. Owing - to the recent hot
wave strictly hard sweet Butter is none too
plentiful, and soft goods are still coming In.
With cooler weather the maTket will probably
get back to its normal condition, in a day

CHICAGO, Sept. 10. â The wheat market
opened a trifle easier as a result of lower
cablea and continued favorable weather, De
cember being eff %c at $1 OSU- The demand
which was very light at the Immediate open-
Ing, soon showed considerable improvement,
commission houses being fair buyers. The de
mand was principally for the December op
tion, the price of which soon went to $1 0$!i.
Trading during: the remainder of the session
was mainly of an evenlns-up character.
The fact that the Government reports would
be issued late in the /afternoon prevented any
great amount of new business. A bullish fea
ture of the late market was tbÂ« increased flour
business reported from the Northwest. Tha
market cloted firm with December at $1 03 "A
1 08%.
Favorable advices regarding the condition of
the maturing crop and fear of a bearish gov
ernment report caused weakness in corn. De
cember closed abouf lower at 51c' i
Oats were steady. December closed &@Vic
lower at 32 Â»,4 032 %c.
Selling by pit traders due to prospects of In
creased holding receipts was the chief reason
for a. small decline throughout the entire pro
vision list. The volume of .trading was small.
At the close January pork was 5c lower, lard
60 lower nnd ribs down 5c. . . â¢

Potatoes, Onions and Vegetables.-
The Potato market had an easy tone, with
trade quiet, and prices of river Burbanka
ranged lower. There was '. quite 1 an accumu
lation of low.- grade river Burbanks lying on
the wharves, and such stock was hard to sell,
even at concessions. Onions were fairly active.
but the market was overstocked and rather
weak. Some dealers were, offering the best
stock at $1 20 per cental.
The market for miscellaneous vegetables was
liberally supplied and generally weak. Wax
Beans were in limited supply and firm, while
String and Lima Beans were very weak, with
poor and old lots selling below the quotations.
Garlic was firm and sold readily at the quo
tation. Tomatoes were weaker, as stocks were
too heavy for the regular trade to absorb and
the canners were not In the market.

COTTON â The sentiment at present among
the majority of operators appears to be bear
ish for a long pull on the expectation that the
increasing volume of receipt* will weigh heav
ily on the market and that priees will Â¦ be
forced lower before the first flood of the move
ment of the crop subsides. There is, how.
ever, no guarantee that the crop will be over
11.600,000 bales, and as fully 11.000.000 will
be needed this year by the spinners to meet
the shortage In the world's stocks of the
staple and manufactured goods from the short
crops of the past five years and the enforced
curtailment of production of goods during
the past year, there Is nothing to warrant tho
expectation, of any big break In the market
from this level.
The private wires of E. T. Hutton. A Co.
from Wall street yesterday said:
STOCKS â Market continued buoyant to-day
and closed with a rather wild rush of buy-
Ing which put prices up rather sharply. The
bark statement proved to be unfavorable, but
had no effect. Continued aggressive buying
by leading bull Interests were the factors.
Th<! market showed only a slight reactlonal
tendency at close. The market has abounded
with bull rumors of various kinds calculated
to stirculato the spread of bullish sentiment
and .encourage general buying. The bull In
terest have taken advantage of the. strength
and broadness of the market to unload a por
tion of holdings which they have been carry
ing the ra*t six months, and most of which
were accumulated during the depression of
last winter. Should the Government report
turn xrtit" satisfactory and confirm the present
promise cf the big corn crop, there Is reason
to believe bullish speculation will be continued
on an arrressive scale next week, as the
largest market interests have not yet been
able to distribute much etock and are still
working on the bull side on the belief that
the situation Is favorable to still higher prices,
especially In view of the continued plethora
of money still offering on call and time loans
at low rates of interest.

General Manager Chapman of the
United Railroads announces a num
ber of changes in thÂ« present routes
of the various street railway lines.

Fourth, Berry, Third, to Townsend, to
Fourth, to Brannan, to Fifth and
along that thoroughfare to Market
street. Returning they will run along

On the First-street line the cars
will bo operated from the Third and
Towsend street depot via Third, Bran
nan, Second, Folsom, First and Bat
tery and thence to Sansome and Bush
streets and to Battery and California
streets, returning over the same route.
The Sixth-street line, whose cars are
now operated from Sixth and Brannan
streets via Sixth, Taylor and Post
streets to Montgomery, a change will
be made so that after September 15
they will run from Sixth and Bran
nan streets by way of Sixth, Taylor,

and lower prices. There are no evidences.

The New Tork circular of Henry Clews says:
"RarjTjafl managers ere taklsg on a dis
tinctly more optimistic spirit, the result of
co-jree cf a good harvest. Current gross earn

the year, and during the next three months

important gains In net earr.lr.ji owing to the
economies which have Uen put into force.
Many of th* heavy expenditures of the last
:our or CtÂ» years were for the distinct pur
pose of reducing the expense ratio and net
?Â¦arcings should now show the- benefits of
this policy, as wtll as from the stoppage of
ta* apeclal outlays which such Improvements
necessitated. American railroads as a rule
were never eo well equipped for hantlllr.g a
ssrge traffic with economy as they are to-day:
ri-3eral!y they are in the soundest
financial and physical condition in their his
tory, a fact that must affect their value as
investments, especially If traffic increases, as
Â«t*naÂ« more thin probable.

ef the gTeatctt hindrances to business activity
tas betn thÂ« high level cf commodity prices;
another obstacle, the unsettled condition of the
labor market. There are Indications of a
change for the better in both these respects.
Cotton and wbeat have descended from their
recent high speculative level; and what is
errtclally Important. Iron and steel prices are
settling down to normal and more stable levels.
Prices of Iron . aad steel have bÂ«Â«n too long
held" at almost proh'.bltlx-e figures by the
various poo'n and the trnpt; At last these
are giving way, owing to obsenc* of business
at old prie*s. and healthier conditions are in
proepect. Iron and steel enter so extensively
into all sorts cl enterprises that the return
ef this Industry to t*re normal is eure to ex
Â«rc;sr a rtlrsulating effect in other directions,
and ete long reduced prices should be followed
by en accumulation of orders held back for

"The Trar between- capital ar.d labor may

bien r*ssed. and Important lessons have been
learned on both tides, which should at least
â¢erve to (Jln-.ir.'.Eh friction end trouble in the

to say. is scarcely a factor in the situation.

"The niupey market remains easy in spite of

GENERAL BUSINESS.
Current Conditions Excellent and
the Outlook Bright.
The burrs are rather email, but the vines
are free of lice and the crop Is of good qual
ity, although slightly below the average in
weight.
Summer apples have dropped heavily, but
late apples continue doing well and prom'.ee
abundant yields. Prunes . are ripening and
picking will become general about the middle
of the month. Peaches and blackberries "are
