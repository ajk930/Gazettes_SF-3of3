No hint of serious disorder was given until late in

the negroes to be more circumspect in their behavior

part of the day, also had spoken to the ringleaders.
Gradually small bands of negroes became merged and a

jeering at. the- whites.
As the- line was passing the corner of Wharton and

it and Jumped toward the fellow, intending to arrest

BALTIMORE, Md., May SO.â Mayor
Robert M. McLane of this city shot and
killed himself this afternoon in his
bedroom at his residence, -V 29 West
Preston street. His bride of less than
two weeks was" at the time asleep In
an adjginlng room and "was awakened
by the discharge of the revolver, which
McLane evidently fired while standing
before the mirror of the dressing table.
The bullet entered. the right temple,
and, crashing through the head,
emerged back of the left ear.
Mra. McLane and other members of
the household rushed i to the Mayor's
assistance, but he did. not regain con
sciousness after he fell to the floor,
and expired within an hour.
No cause can be assigned for the act
by any member of McLane's family.
Since the fire of last February he has
been kept assiduously. at. work admin

endeavoring to direct the rehabilitation
and rebuilding of the burned dis

by. his political opponents, is believed
by many to have caused a temporary

.. PARIS. May 30. â Inquiries made at the Foreign Of
fice, regarding an unofficial intimation that the United
States Government would welcome the aid of France
toward securing the release of Ion Perdicaris and Crom
well Varley from the Moorish brigands show that no
request of that kin4 has been received and that there
fore Â«no steps are contemplated.
FRENCH AID HAS NOT BEEN REQUESTED.
WASHINGTON. May 30. â Admiral Chad wick's arri
val at Tangier this morning on the flagship Brooklyn
was reportc-d by Consul Gummere, and the Navy De
partment received a cable direct from Admiral Chad
wick. It is not believed there will be any change In the
Fituation until the complete squadrons of Rear Admirals
Chadwick and Jewell reach Morocco. The question of
landing marines will be left practically to their Judg
ment. Admiral Chadwick will confer with Gummere at
once and a report of their views of the situation will be
sent to the State Department.
. Should there be no indication, within twenty-four
hours after due notice has been served, of the release of
the prisoners, this Government will not hesitate to land
marines to assist the soldiers the Sultan of Morocco may
call out for a show of force against the bandits. Should
no relief come under the circumstances, this Government
will then hold the Government of Morocco responsible
for whatever may happen to Perdicaris; and should the
Sultan, after every effort, fail to bring the- prisoners out
alive, the possibility of the situation is the extermina
tion of the bandits by United States marines.
There is no doubt in the minds of the officials here
that the Government of France would gladly aid the
United States in securing the release of Perdicaris by all
means in its power. Because of her authority in Mo
rocco France perhaps could do more in a peaceable man
ner than any other nation to effect the release of the
men. If the United States decide to make any request
for assistance from France, naturally it would be in an
unofficial manner, and if other attempts to secure the
release of Perdicaris fail such intimation of a desire for
French assistance may be made through the State De
partment.
It is the understanding here that the admiral com
manding the American fleet has orders to exercise pres
sure upon the Moorish authorities to Induce them to
accept Raissouli's terms. The Sultan Is willing to pay
a ransom and liberate Raesouli's partisans, who are now
imprisoned, but Rassouli now demands American pro
tection for the settlement. This last condition is con
sidered dependent upon the American Government.
Rear Admiral Chad wick, accompanied -by an aid.- the
"L'nlted States Consul General and two marines, visited
Torres, the representative of the Sultan at Tangier. The
interview lasted ten minutes, after which Torres re
turned the visit at the United States consulate, the
Brooklyn firing a salute in his honor.
Torres has informed the American and the British
representatives that he cannot grant Raissouli's terms.
A special courier, it is reported, has been sent to the
Sultan, conveying the American view.
MARIXES 3IAY PURSUE THE BRIGANDS.
TANGIER, Morocco, May 30. â The United States
cruiser Brooklyn, flying the flag of Rear Admiral Chad
wick, arrived here to-day and was soon followed by the
cruiser Atlanta. Other American vessels are expected
shortly. . i'i-\
The authorities here consider that the position of the
American, Ion Perdicaris. and his stepson, Cromwell Var
ley, a British subject, â¢who were kidnaped by bandits
headed by Raissouli. is now more serious than before/
The crowded galleries arose and ap
plauded for five minutes, crying "Viva
Combes." Signor Glolittl continued:
"Therefore, the unhappy phrase was
for Italy the happiest. The note con
tained the usual protest which the
Vatican has been repeating for thlrty
foor years. Italy has no reason to
change her policy. She does not fear
the Invasion of the. congregations, as
she has laws to protect herself. If these
laws are insufficient we will make new
ones. To fear that the country cannot
protect itself against the influences of
foreign congregations is to insult Ital
ians. The state and the church must
be as two parallel lines which never
meet. Both must enjoy liberty. It will
be worse for the church on the day
that she illegally interferes in the mat
ters of the state."
Signor Guercl, continuing, said that
Italy had less to fear from the papacy
than other countries. Being near the
Vatican, she could always see prep
arations behind th? scenes. He com
plained that the Pope, who In his ca
reer before he became Pontiff saw, ap
preciated and profited by Italian unity,
should now, as Pontiff, have as high
inspirer and executive against Italy,
a foreigner. Cardinal del Val.
Premier Glolittl, who arose amid a
breathless silence, said the Vatican
note naturally was nipt communicated
to the Italian Government. France had
answered it as she thought best. The
affair was one In which Italy could not
interfere. The Vatican note contained
a phrase regarding the King of Italy,
but the effect produced was such that
they must be extremely glad of the ex
istence of that phrase, as it has offered
Premier Combes the opportunity to
make a statement so flattering to Ital
ian patriotism.

BITTER TOWARD DEL VAIi.
ROME, May 30.â The Chamber of
Deputies was crowded to-day to hear
the discussion of the attitude of the
Government toward the Vatican's pro
test against President Loubet. Signor
Mazza, Republican, called the note of
the Papal Secretary of State, Merry del
Val, a "perfect insult." He recalled
that the Pope had not protested
against atrocious offenses to religion in
France. His Holiness had now risen
against a King who, according to the
Vatican, had stolen the pontifical patri
mony, designating his Majesty as a
usurper. The note, therefore, was a
declaration of war. Signor Mazza
asked the Government to take ener
getic action to prevent the Invasion
of the church into the kingdom's af
fairs. The Government had forgotten
all pride and the national dignity in
answering the Vatican insult by giving
hospitality to Cardinal Svampa when
the King, on Sunday, went to Bo
logna. -The Government permitted the
people of France to- defend Italian
rights.
The Liberals and the extreme par
ties applauded and the galleries joined.

CALL BUREAU, HOTEL BARTON,
WASHINGTON, ' May 30.â The inter
view with former President Cleveland
declaring for Judge Parker attracted
general attention here to-day and ex
cited varied comment. There are some
prominent Democrats in the city, and
of the number here several declined to
talk for publication. Some of them fa
vor other candidates. than Judge Park
er, and see no merit in Cleveland's ad
vocacy .'of; his. nomination. Others are
still afraid to be placed in the' position
of commending anything Mr. Cleveland
may do or say.
.Representative La Mar of Florida
gild: "Mr. Cleveland is unpopular with
the great majority of Democrats in my
State, and, I think, unpopular with
Southern Democrats generally. Not
withstanding this, he has a large fol
lowing In the South, composed of busi
ness men and others, who either did
not support Bryan , or supported him
unwillingly. It would therefore seem
to I me Cleveland's strong indorsement
of \Parker's candidacy, will tend . to
strengthen thÂ« sentiment In favor of
Parker will be the nominee' 'as "hs
choice of the Southern people, and that
Cleveland's attitude may tend to in
crease the harmony- which prevails
among the Democrats of that section."
Senator Culberson of Texas said Mr.
Cleveland's. advocacy of Parker would
probably help the -latter's candidacy
among the conservative Democrats of
the East.. Â¦ : â¢
Former Representative Trigg of Vir
ginia said: "Mr. Cleveland's indorse
ment of Parker will have a far-reach
ing effect. It will, commend the Judge
to thoughtful men as a safe and con
servative candidate."
Republican comment was all expres
sive of the belief that throughout the
East Cleveland's advocacy of Judge
Parker would do the latter much good.
It is figured that Cleveland's position
will have the effect of throwing the
Massachusetts delegation to Parker
after it has given a complimentary vote
to Olney, and that it will carry much
weight in Connecticut, New Jersey,
New York and Ohio.

MAY END THE DEADLOCK.
Illinois Republican Convention Will
Reconvene To-Day.
SPRINGFIELD, 111., May 30. â The
Republican . State Convention, . after a
recess of eleven' days, will reconvene
to-morrow afternoon to resume bal
loting for a candidate for Governor.
The previous session covered more
than a week and fifty-eight futile bal
lots were taken, leaving the seven
aspirants for the nomination about
where they stood on the first ballot.
All headquarters have been re
opened and all the aspirants are pres
ent except Governor Yates, who will
arrive from Chicago to-morrow. It is
the prevailing opinion to-night that no
nomination will be made before
Wednesday. Many believe, however,
that, the deadlock will not be broken
before Friday. There is talk of a pro
posal) which was voted down before
the r recess * was taken, to suspend the
balloting for Governor and to nomi
nate the rest of the ticket, provided
the deadlock is not broken to-morrow.
This time it. Is proposed -to except
the. nomination for Lieutenant Gov
ernor,' leaving it to be . taken . up after
the candidate for Governor is named.
The plan is indorsed by the candidates
for the minor- offices.
/About the ; only, story afloat to-night
to : which any credence whatever is
given is that Yates and Lowden have
agreed to throw Â¦ their delegates to a
third man. It is said that no third
man has yet been chosen. It Is de
clared to be a part of the compact
that Yates Is to go to the United States
Senate in v 1907 and that Lowden is
to be made Governor four years hence.
All knowledge of such a combination,
however, is denied by Yates' and Low
den's managers. . .
TOKIO, .May 30. â General Nakamura's detachment,
which occupied Liushutun on Friday, captured four Rus
sian guns.
CHEFU. May 31. â Junks with cocoons for the silk
mills are arriving from west of the Yalu River. This
indicates that with the passing of the armies the Chinese
have recommenced their regular occupations.
From a Manchuria merchant it has been learned that
the Japanese have Â¦ ccupied the Maotienling Mountains.
100 miles northwest dl Fengwangcheng and directly east
of Liaoyang. There is only one pass through the range.
ST. PETERSBURG. May 51. â The reported defeat of
Cossacks at Aiyangpienmen was the only news and al
most the only topic of conversation in St. Petersburg
last night. No official dispatches were given out last
evening, but officers at military headquarters were re
luctant to accept the, Japanese dispatches. They think
.it^puegible - that the Japanese mtt Generar Mistchenkoti
command, which has recently been raiding in Korea. It
is formed of comparatively raw recruits. thou&Ii now
somewhat hardened bjr three months' campaigning. It
is conceivable that they might have been defeated, but
not Rennenkampf's forces patrolling the Alyang region,
who are veterans of that old command which accom
panied him on the famous ride through Manchuria.
These men are esteemed here as the hariie3t riders and
the most reckless fighters in the trans-Baikal army. Any
disaster to them would have a greater sentimental effect
than the reverse at Kinchou.
The War Office -has received the following dispatch
from General Kuropatkin, under to-day's date:
"I this morning received a report stating that the
Japanese advance on Kwantien has been begun "from
Saimatsza. The number of the enemy is not known."
BRIEF RESPITE.
LONDON, May 31. â The attack on Port Arthur, the.
Chronicle's Tokio correspondent telegraphs, is expected
to begin about Jur.e 15. Correspondents will leave To
kio on June 10, in time to see the capture, probably
about June 20. The correspondent also says 10,000 Rus
sians have been sent up the Liao River in junks to Tie
ling. ' Â¦ Â¦ s
The Post's Shanghai correspondent wires that several
Japanese transports are landing troops in East Korea,
The reports published in Paris of discord in the in
terview between General Kuropatkin and Viceroy Alex
ieff at Mukden and the southern movement of the Rus
sian vanguard below Wafengtien have given rise to ru
mors that General Kuropatkin has yielded to the wishes
of the Alexieff party and is attempting to relieve Port
Arthur. . -
According to correspondents at Japanese headquar
ters up to May 29 nothing important had developed be
yond outpost encounters. Japanese troops are largely
engaged in building roads and bridges. The Standard's
correspondent says that General Kuroki gave a luncheon
to foreign military attaches to celebrate the victory on the
Yalu, 'while almost simultaneously the Japanese first
army was informed of the Kinchou victory. The same
correspondent indicates the reason for delay in the op
erations. He says that the force that landed at Taku
shan appears to have struck the fringe of the rainy sea
son. The downpour has been very heavy.
KUROPATKIN'S WOES MULTIPLY.
General Kuropatkin, the Telegraph's St. Petersburg
correspondent says, is fighting two enemies â one at home,
the other in Manchuria. While his military reputation
is undergoing a terrible ordeal, he is also accused of fail
ure, as Minister of War, to make proper preparations for
war. The Emperor is alleged to be so dissatisfied that
he would dismiss both Alexieff and Kuropatkin were it
not that he fears the effect on public opinion. The gen
eral impression among the highest classes is that the
fall .of Port Arthur ought to mean the end of the war
and that if the Japanese should succeed in this aim Rus
sia's best interest would be to make peace: but nobody,
the correspondent avers, possesses the moral courage to
make such a suggestion to the Emperor.
The correspondent also asserts that an agreement Is
drafted whereby Germany promises armed support to
Russia, if necessary, to prevent England and the United
States attempting to submit the Far Eastern question to
an international congress and declares that the recent
relaxation of anti-Jewish laws by Russia is the outcome
of the desire of the Minister of the Interior to conciliate
American opinion.
A dispatch from Toklo to-day, after covering the
news previously contained in the dispatch detailing the
fighting on the Kwantung Peninsula, adds that the Jap
anese captured a quantity of powder and six railroad
cars at Liushutun.
The dispatch also says that the Japanese, after de
feating the Cossacks at Aiyangplenmen," northeast of
Fengwangcheng, occupied that place and reinforcements
were sent forward to support them.
SENDING MORE TROOPS TO MAINLAND.
-"WASHINGTON, May 30. â Advices received here re
port the departure from Japan of another division.
While its destination is not stated, it is conjectured that
these troops are about to close in the Russians' rear on
Northeast Korea, cutting off the raiding parties which
have threatened General KurokFs communications. There
are less than 15,000 soldiers in the expedition.
The reported offer of "Japan to China to surrender to
her* so much of Manchuria as already has been taken by
the Japanese troops is .viewed here with interest, because
of the possibility, if the offer i3 accepted by China, that
Russia will hold that' the Celestial empire has thereby
broken her pledged neutrality, thus affording ground for
an attack upon certain parts of Mongolia would t>e
of great strategic value in the war. >
x LIAOYANG, May 30. â The impression at headquar
ters is growing. that the main objective of the enemy is
Port Arthur and it would not be surprising if the actual
assault on that - fortress began within a fortnight. No
important movement <5f General Kuroki had been report
ed up to the time this dispatch was filed.
. CHEFU. May 30. â From Chinese sources it Is learned
that the Russians have four lines of defense between Nan
shan and Port Arthur.

to decorate the exterior of a wealthy
silk manufacturer's house in Athenia
have struck because the color scheme
chosen by the owner of the house did
not suit them.
The silk manufacturer ordered the
building dressed in white, with green
shutters. When this paint had been
laid on he told the men to make the
trimmings a bright yellow. They re
monstrated, but to no purpose. The
men asserted that such a combination
would ruin their employer's business

. "A detachment of Japanese cavalry
consisting of 150 sabers, moved forward
from the main body on May 27 and ap

southeast of Wafanghoon station, but
on encountering our frontier guards

ST. PETERSBURG, May 30.âAc
cording to information received from a
high source, Important news regarding
the Japanese plan of campaign which
has reached the Russian . authorties
since the battle of Klnchou ; compels
the conviction that the advance of
General Kyroki and the activity of his
scouts northwest and southwest of
Fengwangcheng are parts of a well
executed feint to prevent General Ku
ropatkin detaching a strong force to
hamper General Oku's operations on
the Liaotung Peninsula. Under cover
of General Kurokl's screens, it is add-,
ed, a part of the Japanese army land
ed at Takushan will be moved south
ward into the peninsula, while Kuroki
attempts to make Kuropatkin believe
that he intends to force a decisive en
gagement with him. This information
would tend to prove 'that the primary
object of the Japanese campaign all
along has been Port Arthur, and/ once
that fortress Is in their hands, unless
an exceedingly favorable opportunity
offers to attack Kuropatkin, the Japan
ese plan Is simply to make their tenure
secure and force the Russian ! com
mander to assume the offensive. More
over, there is information to the effect
that the Japanese propose to storm
Port Arthur with the least possible de
lay, after having flrst closed the har
bor to render the egress of the Russian
ships impossible at tije last moment,
thus forcing the Russians to destroy
them without subjecting the Japanese
to the inevitable losses which would Oc
cur if the Russian squadron got out for
a last fight before going to the bottom.
The Admiralty denies the reports of
the loss of two Russian torpedo-boat
destroyers while .laying, the mines
which destroyed the Japanese battle
ship Hatsuse. The officials say Port
Arthur has been heard from since the
Hatsuse was blown up and if the re
ported loss of the torpedo-boat destroy
ers were true they would have known it.

added:
Â¦ But I can assure you that the blood that
flows through my veins is pumped by a heart
that is as loyal to the Stars and Stripes as
that of any man that walks God's green foot
stool. Time has furled the battle flags and
smelted the hostile guns. Let the silver
trumpet sound the Jubilee of peace. Let the
veteran shout who wore the .blue. Let. him
kiss the silken folds of the gorgeous ensign of

the National Hymn, a privilege he has the
constitutional and victorious right to perform.

GETTYSBURG. Pa., May 30.â On
historic Cemetery Hill, overlooking
ground hallowed by the blood of half
a hundred thousand brave men and in
the presence of a concourse of thou-
Eands who had assembled to pay tri
bute to the memory of the natlon f s
dead. President Roosevelt to T day de
livered a notable address. On nearly
the same spot, on November 19, 1S63,
President Lincoln delivered the im
mortal address enunciating principles
which have rung round the world for
more than a third of a century.
President Roosevelt was escorted to
the cemetery on the battlefield by a
body of several hundred veterans of
the Civil War. The President and his
special escort were preceded by several
organization's, including a squadron of
United States cavalry, the Third Unit
ed States Artillery and the Marine
band of Washington, which had been
ordered here for the occasion. Mrs.
Roosevelt and other members of the
President's party followed in carriages.
The rear of the procession consisted of
civic organizations and citizens in car
riages. Governor. Pennypacker .ol
Pennsylvania presided at the ceremon
ies, which were held on the rostrum in
the cemetery.
After the Memorial day services of
the G. A. R. had been concluded and
the pupils of the public schools had
strewn flowers over the graves of the
thousands of dead, during which cere
mony the Marine band played a solemn
dirge. Rev. Dr. Edward Everett Hale,
chaplain of the United States Senate,
pronounced the invocation.
THE PRESIDENT'S ADDRESS.
The President was then introduced
by Governor Pennypacker. As the
President arose to speak a downpour
of rain began and continued through
out the time ne addressed the great as
semblage. He was accorded an en
thusiastic reception, notwithstanding
the rain, and the crowd of 10.000 people
in the cemetery remained to hear the
address despite the thorough drench
ing they received.
Referring in the beginning of his
speech to the allusion of Governor Pen
nypacker to the death of Senator Quay,
the President said:
Governor Pennyoacker alluded to the fact
that to-day Pennsylvania mourns Its senior
Senator. The regiment which Senator Quay
was instrumental in raising took part in this
battle- of Gettysburg â the battle In which
Governor Pennvpacker shared. Senator Quay
was not with it. He had gone with another
regiment and it is appropriate to caJl at
tention at this time to the fact that when
the terra of service of that regiment expired.
Just before. Fredericksburg. Senator Quay de
clined to accept the charge' and continued as
a volunteer with the army that fought at
Kredericksburg and won the medal of honor
on that bloody day. . \ .
Continuing, the President said
The place where we now are has -won a
double distinction. Here was fought one of
the great battles of all time, and here waa
*pcken one of the few speeches which shall
last thsough the ages. As long as this repub
lic endures or its history is known. Â»j long
thall the memory cf the battle of Gettysburg
likewise endure and be known; and as long as
the Knglish tongue In understood, so long
ehall Abraham Lincoln's Gettysburg speech
thrill the hearts of mankind.
The civil war was a great war for righteous
ness: a war waged for the noblest Ideals, but
waged also In thoroughgoing, practical fashion.
It was on* of the few wars which mean. In
their successful outcoqpe. a lift toward better
things for the nations of mankind. Some wars
have meant the triumph of order over an
archy and licentiousness masquerading aa lib
erty; some wars have meant th<Â» triumph of
liberty over tyranny masquerading as order;
but this victorious war of ourÂ» meant the
triumph of both liberty and order, the triumph
of orderly liberty, the bestowal of civil rights
upon the freed slaves, and at the same time
the stern Insistence on the supremacy of the
national law throughout the length and breadth
of the land. Moreover, this was one of those
rare contests in which It wÂ»s to the immeasur
able Interest of the, vanquished that they
should lose, while at the same time the vic
tors acquired the precious privilege of trans
mitting to those who came after them, as a
heritage of honor forever, not only the mem
ory of their own valiant dÂ«eds, but the mem
ory of the deeds of those who no lees valiantly
and with equbl sincerity of purpose, fought
against the stare in their courses. The war
left to us all, as fellow-countrymen, as broth
ers, the right to rejoice "that the Union has
bten restored in indestructible shape in a.
country where slavery no longer mocks the
boai>t of freedom, and also the right to rejoice
with exultant pride In the courage, the selt
â¢acrlfice and the devotion alike of the men who
wore the blue and the men who wore the gray.
A GIGANTIC STRUGGLE.
He is but a poor American who, looking at
this field, does 'not frel within himself a
de*i>*r reverence for the nation's past and a
higher purt>os^ to make the nation's future
rUe level to her past. Here fought the chosen
fons of the North and the- South, the Kast
and the West. The armies which on this field
contended for the mastery w-ere veteran armies
hardened by long campaigning and desperate
fighting into wjch instruments of war as no
other nation then possessed. The eeverity cf
the fighting Is attested by the proportionate
low â Â¦ ' n Â«s unrivaled In any battle of similar
eize since the close of the Napoleonic struggles;
a loe= which in certain regiments was from
three-fourths to four-fifths of the men engaged.
Every spot on this field has its own associa
tions of eoldierly duty nobly done, of supreme
eelf-Kacrlflce freely rendered. The names of
the chiefs who berved In the two armies form
a long honor roll; and the enlisted men were
worthy, and even more than worthy of those
who led them. Every acre of this ground has
its own associations. We see where the fight
thundered through and around the village of
Gettysburg; where the artillery formed on the
ridges; where the cavalry fought; where thÂ»
hl!Is were attacked and defended: and where,
finally, the great charge surged up the slope
only to break on the summit In the bloody
epray of gallant failure. Â« l
But the soldiers who won at Gettysburg
the soldiers who fought to a finish the civil
war and thereby made tliclr countrymen for
ever their debtors, have left us far more
even than the memories of the war Itself
They tuught for four years In order that on
this continent those who came after them,
their children and their children's children
might enjoy a lasttng peÂ«ce. They took arms
now to destory, but to save liberty; not to
overthrow, but -to establish the supremacy of
the law. The crisis which they faced was to
determine whether or not this people was fit
for self-government and therefore fit for lib
erty. Freedom ts not a gift which can be
enjoyed save by those who show themselves
worthy of Jt. In -this world no privilege can
I* permanently appropriated by men who have
not the power and the will Successfully to as
sume the responsibility of using It aright. In
Ms recent admirable little volume on freedom
and responsibility In democratic government.
President Hadley cf Tale has pointed out that
the freedom which is worth anything Is the
freedom "which means self-government and not
anarchy. Freedom thuÂ« conceived Is a con
structive force, which enables an. Intelligent
and good man to do better things than he
could do without It; which Is In Us essence
the sabctltution of self-restraint for external
restraint â the substitution of a form of re*
restraint which promotes progress for the form
which retards It. This la the right view of
freedom; but It can only be taken If there is
a full recognition of the close connection be
tween liberty and responsibility in every do
main of human thought. It was essentially
the view taken by Abraham Lincoln, and by
all these who, when the civil war broke out,
realized that in a . nelf-governlng democracy
those who desire to bÂ« considered fit to enjoy
liberty must chow that they, know how to use
It with moderation and Justice in peace, and
how to fight for It when it .is Jeoparded by
malice domestic or foreign levy.
AX EXXOBLING LESSON*.
The lessons they taught us are Iecsona as
applicable In our everyday lives now as In
thÂ« rare times of great (trees. The men who
made this Held forever memorable did so be
cause they combined thÂ« power of fealty to a
lofty Ideal with the Dower of showing that
fealty In hard, practical, common sense fash-
Ion. They stood for the life of effort, not the
life of- ease. They had that lov* of country,
that love of Justice, that love of their fellow
men, without which pow-er and resourceful ef
ficiency but- make a man a danger to hfs fel
lowi. Tet. In addition thereto.-they likewise
possessed the power and the efficiency; for
otherwise their high purpose would have been
barren of result. They knew each how to act
for himself, and yet each how to act with his
feUows. They learned, aÂ« all the generation
of the CJvll War learned, that rare Indeed Is
the chance to do anything worth doing by one
sudden and rfolent effort. The men who be
lieved that thÂ« Civil War would be ended in
ninety days, the men who cried loudest, "On
to Richmond." Jf they had the right stnff in
Umn cpeedlljr learned their error, and the war
was actually won by those who settled them
selves steadfastly down to light for three
years, or for as much longer as the war might
last, and who gradually grew to understand
that the triumph would come, not by a single
brilliant victory, but by & hundred painful and
tedious campaigns.
; . ; GUIDE IX CIVIL MFE.
In the East and the West the columns ad
vanced and recoiled, swayed from side to
side, and . again advanced; along the coasts
the black ships stood endlessly off and on be
fore the hostile forts; generals and admirals
emerged into the light, each to face his
crowded hour of success or failure: the men In
front fought: the / tnen behind supplied and
pushed forward those In front; and the final
victory was due to the deeds of all who played
their parts well and manfully, in the scores
of battles, in the countless skirmishes, in
march, in camp or in reserve, as commissioned
officers or in the ranks â wherever and when
ever duty called them. Just so It must be for
ua in civil life. We can make and keep this
country worthy of the men who gave their
llvea to save j It. only on condition that the
average man among us on the whole does his
duty bravely, loyally and with common sense,
in whatever position life allots to him. Na
tional greatness is of slow growth. It cannot
be forced and yet be stable and enduring, for.
It Is based fundamentally upon national char
acter, and national character Is stamped deep
in a people by the lives of many generations.
The men who went Into the army had to sub
mit to discipline; had to submit to restraint
through the government of the leaders they
had chosen, as the price of winning. So we,
the people, can preserve our liberty and our
greatness in time of reace only by ourselves
exerclsln- thÂ« virtues of honesty, of self-re-:
stralnt and of fair dealing betw-een man and
man. In all the ages of the past men have
seen countries lose' their liberty because their
people could not restrain and order themselves,
and therefore forfeited the tight to what they
were unable to use with wisdom.
Exactly as !n time of war courage is the
cardinal virtue of the soldier, so in time of
peÂ»ee. honesty, using the word in Its deepest
and broadest significance, is the essential llaslc
virtue, without which all else avails as nothing.
HONOR, TO THE SOLDIERS.
It was because' you men of the Civil War
both knew how to use liberty temperately and
how to defend' It at need that we and our
children and our children's children shall hold
you in honor forever. Here, on Memorial day.
on this great battlefield, we commemorate not
only the chiefs who actually won, this battle;
not only Meade and his lieutenants. Hancock
and Reynolds and Howard and Sickles and
the many others whose names flame in /our
annals, but also the chiefs who had made the
Army of the Potomac what it was. and those
who afterward led it in tha campaigns which
were crowned at Appomattox; and, further
more, those who made and used its sister
armies: McClellan. with his extraordinary ge
nius for organization; Rosecrans: Buell: Thom
as, the unyielding, the steadfast; and that great
trio. Sherman. Sheridan and. last and greatest
of all. Grant himself, the silent soldier whose
hammer-like blows finally beat down even
the prowess of the men who fought against
him. Above all. we meet here to pay homag*
t<> the officers and enlisted Â«men who servÂ»d
and fousht and died without having, as their
chiefs had. the chance to write their names
on the tabiets of fame; to the men who
marched and fought in the ranks, who were
buried in lonr trenches on the field of battle,
who died In cots marked only by numbers in
the hospitals; who. If they lived, when the
war was over, went back each to his task -n
the farm or in t^e town, to do his duty In
I>ea.cÂ« as he had done it in war: to take up
the threads of his working life where he had
, dropped them when the trumpets of the nation
pealed to arms. To-day, all over this land our
peorle meet to .pay reverent homage to the
dead who died that the nation might live; and
. vre pay homage also to their comrades who are
! still with us. . - . '
; All ar<Â» at one now, the son* of those who
I wore the blu^ and the sons of thosÂ« who wore
I the rray. and all can unite in paying respect
'Â¦Â¦ to the memory of those who fell, each of them
' trivinr his life for Ms duty as he raw it: anil
! all should be at one In learning from tfi*
deaths of these men how to live usefully
while thÂ» times call for the performance of
the counters necennary duties of everyday
life, and how to hold ourselves ready to die
nobly should the nation ever aeain demand of
her sons the ultimate proof of loyalty.

Strive for Honors In Athletics.
Boys ran and boys jumped and
boys put the shot and did other
athletic stunts at the track of the
Wilmerding School yesterday. They
ran well and Jumped well and put the
shot like veterans, all of which pleased
the managers of the Columbia Park
Boys' Clubs, for it .was the semi-an
nual fiejd day of this popular organi
zation that brought the boys together.
Weather conditions did not favor
record-breaking performances, with
the result that the time made in the
running events was not extra fast, but
the finishes were all close and exciting
enough/ to bring great applause from
the spectators. The Jumpers cleared
the bar at astonishing heights and the
lads * who threw the nine and twelve
pound shot tossed* the sphere far
enough to win "plaudits from . thos^
that witnessed their efforts.
When the scorers at the end of the
day's sport footed up the totals It was
seen that the honors of the day rested
with the boys that are members of
the Thursday Evening Club. Their
score was 3C points. The Monday Even
ing Club boys came next, with a score
of 32 points, and third place went to
the boys of the Friday evening Club,
who scored 23 points.

ping the scales at about the same notch
as when he took on Corbett. Like
maiden ladles, shy and secretive about

Several thousand persons interested
in light harries? racing went to Inyie
uide track yesterday and enjoyed some
of the closest finishes seen here in
years. The affair was under the joint
auspices of the Golden Gate Park
Driving Association and of the ban
Francisco Driving Club.
it was a marked success, the only
drawback beins the dilatory tactics of
some of the amateur reinsmen, which
made the affair drag out until dusic
The best race of the day was the
2:25 class, which was won by Frank
Sc&mitz's gray pacer Doc. In the first!
heat he fought every Inch of the way
ntth H. Schottler's Dynamite, which
I12 beat by inches after a thrilling dilve
through the 'stretch. In the second
heat these two horses and G. Lind
auer's Homeway came ! through the 1
homestretch neck and neck. The \
judges placed them Doc, Homeway and ,
Dynamite, but some of the spectators
thought Homeway won by a narrow
margin.
The time, 2:24 and 2:24?i, was pro-;
nounced excellent, as the track was '.
heavy for harness racing. It was esti
mated to be at least ten seconds slow
to the mile. I
T. Corcoran's MIsfIoh Boy, driven by ,
the veteran J. O'Kane, won the 2:30
class in straight heats.
The handicap race came late In the
day when spectators and drivers alike
were tired Tind It was hardly given a
fair trial. Nuckalls, the driver t/f
Billy F. was charged with having
swung his whip in the face of Clara
L, causing her to break. Billy F was
disqualified and Clara L was given
second place.
John Lawlor took the first and third
heats in the 2:40 class with Grade Mc-
Kinney, a diminutive pacer. She broke
in the second heat, which H. Schott
ler's Lee Roy won, pulled up.
The, Judges declared the bets off on
the only running race of the day as
they did not like the aspect of the af
fair.
It took three heats to decide the 2:20
class. M. M. Donnelly's Flora G took
the first heat. The tire on one of her
sulky wheels broke in the second heat
and with this handicap she was only
beaten a couple of lengths. Clara L
won the second and tnird heats and
the race.
The officials in charge of the races
were: Starter, T. J. Crowley; judges,
James Lawlor, Ellas Williams, Joseph
Windrow and Joseph Cairn Simpson;

Uncle Henry got one yesterday at the
Oakland baseball grounds * while the
sun was yet low in the heavens. He
figured on two in a row, but the
Brownie batsmen upset his calcula
tions with their clubs. Such a beating as
Phil Knell, the National bush leaguer,
got was worth going miles to see If you
had a grudge against him. Scores:
Morning gameâ San Francisco 6, Port
land 2; "afternoon gameâ Portland 11,'
San Francisco 4. ,
" A fairly good collection of fans and '
others dropped In to see the slaughter,
and how they did hand it out to Knell j
and Anderson. The Portlanders made i
a monkey- of Knell whan they com- I
menced to land, and Anderson made a
monkey of himself when the Portland
ers commenced to land. It was Andy I
who started the big onslaught when he |
failed to make connections with a j
grounder in the fourth.
At that time the bases were all dec
orated with a northern star. Two were
out and Drennan lined a grounder to
short that would have been cake for an
inmate of the day* home. .Andy side
stepped at the wrong monrent. After
that it was bins, bing, and five tallies
for Portland before Uncle Hank could
relight the butt of his Btogie.
The game progressed ii this manner
in nearly every inning. Portland could
bit anything that the gasman had. At |
that he did not have much. But
ler held them safe till the eighth when
they sneaked one over on him.
It was comical to see San Francisco
rally in the ninth and ease . through
with three. The game closed with
Meany at the bat and on every bag
loitered a Friscan. Pat filed to Me-
Creedie and then the fans went home,
figuring on what krnd of a game they
would see the next time they went to
the Eighth-street lot. The score:

The cause of the recent trouble was
that some of the rowdies of the Piney
"Woods section banded together to pre
vent negroes working on the construc
tion of the Livingston and Southern
Railroad. They proposed to make â¢ the
company pay them a handsome tribute
if it desired to continue construction,
as the whitecappers claimed they were
"kings of that particular territory."
â¢ The company appealed to the Federal
authorities and the United States Mar
shal, with deputies, invaded that sec
tion and after an exciting experience
arrested the four ringleaders. Further
trouble is expected. The whitecappers
claim to have an unlimited number of
friends and relatives in this section and
that they, propose running things tq
suit themselves. ' i .; .'
GALVESTON, Tex.. May SO.â As the
result of whitecapping running riot in
the Piney "Woods section of East Texas
recently the Federal authorities to-day
arrested four^ white men and are look
ing for several others. The arrests
were made under section 5508 of the
Revised Statutes of the United States,
which places the penalty at a fine of
not more than 55000 and imprisonment
for not more than. ten years.
The arrests of to-day, are for offenses
similar to those which recently oc
curred In North Texas, In which there
were a number of convictions, and sim

IN A SIX-MILE RACE
A special class for seven yachts had
been arranged, but the Acapulco was
the only one to start, j and though she
is a recent recruit in the club she will
be given a flag for having made the
trip alone. ,
The prizes-, in the. twenty- five-foot
class were only contended for by the
Discovery and Neva, though v nine had
been entered. Neva won. .--â¢
â¢ In the thirty-footers the Aeolus and
Truant were the only ones to make the
try, as the Presto was re-classed. The
Aeolus won with . part of her* crew
standing on the spanker boom to keep
her down as she came across the finish
line.
Enthusiasm was divided between the
thirty-six-footers and the class V 1.
When the .whistle sounded for the
former to get away the Presto, In com
mand : of Frank Stone, cut the " corner
around the stake boat and was pre
paring to show her heelp to the balance
of the fleet when for some reason Stone
put about and again made the turn,
thereby losing a minute of his starting
time'. In close order and with every
sheet close hauled the Edna, Thelma
and Emma sent. the spray flying from
their bows and cut in on the port tack
for the shore. Down the course the
yachts ' flew, checking . their : speed but,
little as they luffed and headed away
on the other tack. They finished 'Â¦Â¦ in
the following order: Presto, . Edna,

she could be with the wind nipping the
tops of the waves into froth, while the
Nixie crossed behind her stern, stand-

The Judges and committee in charge
were T. J. -Kavanagh, Douglas Ersklne

cussion for weeks to come.
A better day could not have been
chosen. A spanking breeze blew in

just turned into pasture, she shook the

Murdock Defeats Allen and Will Now Meet
MacGavin for Championship Ten

With the score reading 5 â 2 and two

Percy Murdock, the Alameda tennis
crack, carried off the honors yesterday
in the San Francisco championship
tournament. He beat Will Allen of the
California Club in the finals and thus
earned the right to play Drummond
MacGavln in the challenge match for
the cup. This match will be played
next Sunday at 2 p. m.
As was expected, Murdock and Allen
won places in the finals. The former
beat Carl Gardner easily in the semi
finals and Allen disposed of Herbert
Long.
The final match between Allen and
Murdock was one of the best seen for
some time. Allen, who has been, off .In
his game of late, was at his best yes
terday, and Murdock had to play his
best to beat him.
Murdock's strokes were much better
than his opponent's, but the latter
fought hard art the way. and was as
steady as a clock. Murdock won three
sets out of four, but all of them were
exceptionally close. In the first two
sets and the first part of the third
Murdock was a trifle cleverer than Al
len.
In the fourth set Murdock was at
his best, and although Allen fought
hard he could not quite win out. The
score was 6 â I, 8 â 6, 7â 9, 6â 4.
Murdock's driving was excellent and
he won point after point on clean
passes. Allen's volleying was better
than his opponent's, but Murdock' had
a serve, that Allen could not. handle."' It
had a bad twist and a fast high bound.
The match was witnessed by several
hundred enthusiastic .spectators, /who
were treated to some great tennis. .
In the semi-final matches the winners
had no trouble in beating their oppo
nents. Allen's experience and steadi
ness proved too much for young Long.
The latter made a good showing in. the
first set, but became somewhat discour
aged in the second.
Murdock wins first prize, Allen sec
ond and Long and Gardner the two
third prizes. All are sliver cuds. The
championship match between Murdock
and MacGavln~ promises to be a great
one.
a little, and Allen, as usual, was quick
to take advantage of it. He ran the
score up to 5 â 5, and after appearing
hopelessly beaten at times finally pulled
out the set, . 9 â 7. Allen showed great
determination and made a strong up
hill fight.

SEE THE FLAG ADVANCING.
They arc tha flag advancing on the right;
they bow their heads and bend their shoulders

: SINGING IS OF'IIIGII ORDER.
The singing of the Knickerbocker
Quartet was of a very high order. As
is usual, the firing of volleys over sol
diers' graves by a detail of United
States troops was the striking event of
the ceremonies and many in the great
throng were moved to tears. The final
number, "America," was sung in
chorus, In which every one present

voices could be heard down at the
camp at- the Presidio.

The Slocum carried about 200 passen

and the Sons of Veterans' quartet, con
sisting of Miss E. A. Wolfram, Mrs. W.
F. Buswell, D. D. Wolfram and J. Orr,
sang "Lead, Kindly Light."
Â¦ Captain F. G. Wisker delivered an
address, which was as follows:
i Shipmates, we are assembled to-day to honor
our heroic dead. The duty of this hour is of
Impressive significance; by It we are reminded
that the sacrifices of our fellow shipmates have
not been In vain; that we have a united coun

common to us all; that we /inculcate with a
comprehensive realization the preceptlon that
there Is no North or South, no Kast or West â

patriotism. - '
Men of union and national Integrity died
that the. country might live; that the grand
inheritance ' bequeathed to us by our fore
fathers might remain unbroken; that the union
of all must be one and Indivisible. -
And now, as we gather , within the Â¦ sounds
of the. waves which were In life the hero's
joys, and In 'death his shroud; as we strew
garlands of earth's fairest adornments upon

feature of the day, the strewing of

while many an eye in the throng or

commands then separated, the regular
troops going to the Presidio and taking
part in the ceremonies at the National
Cemetery there, while the members of
the Grand Army posts took cars on
the Gearv and Sutter street lines for
the Odd Fellows' Cemetery, where cere
monies were held at the Grand Army
plat.
AT ODD FELLOWS' CEMETERY.
A great company of citizens and vet
erans assembled early at the Odd Fel
lows' Cemetery. Almost every one
brought flowers. Here and there an
aged woman's trembling hand tenderly
clasped a cluster of roses or violets as
she leaned on the arm of a stalwart
son. whose father had battled in the
great conflict of the sixties. Litue
children carried blossoms to strew on
the graves of heroes they had never
seen. * Groups of pupils from the pub
lic schools, led bv their teachers, dec
orated cany a grave that to them was
only an unknown soldier's last resting
place. Grateful hearts united to pay
tribute to patriotism.
When the posts of the Grand Army
reached the cemetery they formed and
marched to the Grand Army plat, keep-
Ing slow step to strains of solemn
music by the Tenth Infantrv band,
while minute guns were fired by a bat
tery from the Fifth Artillery stationed
near by. The exercises were opened
by W. E. Estes, chairman of the day,
who Introduced the Rev. J. A. B.-Wil

to assist in the simple but impressive
honors at the graves of those that fell
In defense of the flag.
The familiar eight of tha Grand Army
man In his uniform of blue and his
post bafiges was seen early on the
streets. Then came throngs of men,
women e.ixd children, flower-laden and
hastening to the cemeteries. The flower
chops and the street flower markets
had a great trade, crowds of customers
waiting in line to make their choice of
California's most fragrant blooms as
their tribute to the brave. On all the
cars west bound these flowers were car
ried to the burial places, and not a sol
dier's grave in any cemetery failed to
receive its chare of fragrant, bright
hued blossoms.
Meanwhile the military parade was
organizing on Van Ness avenue, at Mc-
Allister street. The turnout of regu
lars and National Guardsmen was in
tended rather as an escort of honor to
the veterans of the Grand Army of the
Republic than as an Imposing military
demonstration, but the spectacle, as
usual, drew its crowds of interested
witnesses and the short parade up the
avenue to Geary street was well man
aged and effective. In the throngs of
onlookers that lined the thoroughfare
nearly every woman and child, with
many of the Â«terner sex. bore bunches
of flowers' in the hands, later to be
carried to the cemeteries. Everywhere
it was a day of flowers.

The participants in the parade were

that labor in America should forever bÂ« freo.
(Applause).
THE WAR MADE LABOR FREE.
This question was the final cause of the war.
Though the South held that labor was dishon
orable, a thing for slaves, the North was de
termined that Us free worklngrrien should no>
longer be subject to thÂ« stigma of Southern re
proaches and the shameful disadvantage of
slave competition. Lincoln correctly appraised
the situation on the eve of the conflict, when
he declared that for one-half of the nation tr>

endurable; the United States must all become
free or all slave. . .

Senator Dodge of Iowa replied: "I have al

Impossible in this country, but after hearing
the declarations Just uttered here I am con
vinced that civil war is inevitable. I for one
am here to testify that all my life 1 havÂ»

even more emphatic in pointing ou/ the Irrec

This irreconcilable difference no longer ex
ists. The war . han brought our country rr.cn
of the South to the same point of view with
us regarding the dignity of labor and the

ADDRESS BY COLONEL. IRISH.
The oration of the evening was an
eloquent and moving address by Col
onel John P. Irish. Received with great
applause and frequently interrupted by
cheers. Colonel Irish spoke of the
causes and meaning of the Civil War,
with especial reference to the bearing
of its lessons upon present day prob
lems. No part of the address was
more heartily cheered than its declara
tion of the right of every man to labor,
even though others declared he should
not. The speaker said in part:
It is ;l great pleasure to speak of men and to
tr.en wljose deeds are written In the book of
glory. ' Next spring forty years will havÂ»
passed since our great civil struggle closed,
and the division of those on the other side of
the line 1Â» already larger than the division on
this side. In a little while there will be no
Grand Army of the Republic. Will the mem
ory an<l services of the men who fought thÂ«
civil war be treasured when that time comes?
It Is' a solemn question and cno of. vital Im
portance to this nation.
That civil war of ours was the greatest com
bat In modern history. In spirit It was a no
ble conflict and it was nobly fought out to
conclusions of lasting value. The ignoble fea
tures of the conflict were mostly confined to
the civilians who remained at hcme both in
the North and In the South i.id abused, and
misconstrued the motives anj acts of the other
ride. The soldiers of the North and thÂ» sol
diers of the South bad no rancor toward on*
another. They had proved the valor of their
adversaries and were ready to testify to the.
bravery with which their opponents fon?ht for
what they deemed right. If all the political
questions growingâout of the war could havs
been left for settlement to the men who fought
it they would have been solved more quickly
and have left fewer scars.
The Grand Army of the Republic
closed its noteworthy observance of
Memorial day with a great mass meet
ing last evening that filled every seat
at the Alhambra Theater. Hundreds
were turned away because of the po
lice prohibition against standing In the
aisles. In spirit as well as In volume
it was one of the heartiest demonstra
tions of patriotic enthusiasm even seen
in San Francisco.

REDDING, Cal., May' SO.â With a
roar that sounded like the explosion of
a charge of dynamite and that rever
berated, through the entire plant, fur
nace No. 1 in the Mountain Copper
Company's smelter at KeaÂ«ick blew up
at 11:30 o'clock this morning. The fur
nace was completely wrecked and five
men were Injured by the explosion. One
of them. Everett Blair, died at 4:30
this afternoon, and another, D. Baws

jured men are: H. Hawkins, charge
dumper, body and head burned; T. Gia
cono, charge wheeler, badly burned;
D. Blesecker, charge wheeler, burned
about the head, body and arms.
The furnace was tapped this morn
ing. That means that all of the molten
metal had been drawn off and the fur
nace ; was empty apparently. As soon
as the tapping was finished j Bawsfleld
and Blair, who. were employed as pipe
fitters for the Mountain Copper Com
pany, started Â» to^ work repairing the
furnace 'and fitting new pipes. Haw
kins, Giacono and Biesecker were near
the furnace attending to their duties
of disposing of the metal.
Just ; as Bawsfleld v and . Blair had
begun work tnere was a terrific ex
plosion and the ' entire furnace blew
out. g Blair: and Bawsfleld were hurled
for a considerable distance and the
charge dumper and wheelers weiP
knocked rfully fifteen feet. Blair and
Bawsfleld were , caught beneath heavy
pieces of the furnace. .
The noise of the explosion brought
hundreds. of workmen to the spot ana
the -injured men were hastily; picked
up and " carried to the company's hos

one had" thrown .a stick of dynamite
into the 'smelter, but V-hat theory, gave
way when an Investigation ;was . made.
Some of the : workmen . accidentally
threw' water. Into- some molten metal
that remained in the furnace after thÂ«

F. Martin Miller, a well-known
Washington correspondent, is the
author of the Hitt boom. It is an il
lustration of how a great fire is kindled
by a small blaze or something like
that. Mr. Miller was in need of a story.
He had noted the wistful desire of the
Republican party for a Vice Presiden
tial candidate of proper character, and
that especially from the State of Illi
nois. The Illinois convention was
about to be. held, and if the man .was
to be found he mst be found quickly.
Cannon and : Cullom had refused. Mil
ler knew Hitt personally and the name
came to mind. He was Just right. A
man of prominence must be found who
would launch him. Miller visited Sen
ator Cullom and he agreed as to the
quality of the candidate, but ** said - he,
Cullom, had already spoken out for
Fairbanks, and they being Senators to
gether he could not retract. At some
considerable pains Miller sought and
found Secretary Shaw, who had ac
quired something of a habit of an
nouncing candidates. Secretary Shaw
paid. "Why, yes; certainly, he is Just
t,he man," and with- that Miller went
away and telegraphed his story to his
paper â "Secretary Shaw nominates
Congressman Hitt, of Illinois," and so
it started on its hurried rounds. Mr.
Hitt got a batch of telegrams a foot
deep next day from his townsmen and
from the lights of politics the country
over, congratulating him and asking if
he would stand for it. Newspaper men
interviewed him at every street corner,
"Would he stand for It?" and - they
published their stories under big head
lines: "He will! He will!" And that's
how it came about. .The idea had Just
come to Miller when he met Mrs. Hitt
entering the gallery ' of- the House of
Representatives, and he said to her.
"I'm going to nominate your, husband
for the Vice Presidency," and she
laughed at what she thought ' was a
pleasantryâ a pleasant bit of gallantry.
But a good many people are betting on
Hitt now. ,
HOW HTTTS BOOM BEGAN'.
the men were ignorant of which dish
before them contained the poison, but
It soon appeared that this had an ef
fect upon the mind that caused the
stomach to refuse all food. Then the
plan of administering the poison in
capsules was adopted. The amount fed
to the soldiers in Cuba formed the reg
ular dose. The experiment came to an
end last -week and the men, in various
stages of wrecked health, are trying to
get rid of the poison in their blood.
The men were examined three times a
day during the whole period and the
results, carefully noted, are said to
fully justify all that has been "done.
The curious part of the experiment is
that the suffering volunteers do not
get even the cheap notoriety that us
ually forms the incentive to this sort
of sacrifice, their names being held
secret.

testing the capacity of the human
Etomach for preset /ed food. The ex
periment was suggested by the denials
of the packers that the chemicals used
were harmful. The dozen young men
who volunteered for the sake of sci
ence â one from the Columbian Univer
sity, one from the Georgetown Univer
sity, the others from the chemical lab
oratory of the bureau â have been
served with the very best the market
affords, prepared by a good cook in an
improvised kitchen and dining-room in

considerably from the experiments.

POISON TESTS SUCCESSFUL.
This Incident of tearing down so
costly a building because it was ugly
and v offended a neighbor Is suggestive
of a policy pursued by many property
owners of the capital city â most of
them non-resident. Washington is a
city of palatial residences, or at least
it is its destiny to become such and is
new moving rapidly in the direction of
its destiny. In many places throughout
the city where the tasteful and sumptu
ous homes of the wealthy congregate
will be seen a neglected space occupied
by squalid cabins tenanted by negroes,
their ragged plcaninnies overrunning
the neighborhood. It is a trick of the
land owner to compel the owners of
the palaces to pay a rate far above the
already high value of the ground. This
device has become such a flagrant
nuisance that a law has been passed
giving the district commissioners the
right to condemn and clear such prop
erty within certain limits.
Not all of the statesmen have quitted
the capital. There are certain com
mittees whose Intersessional duties
require their presence here. One of
these- has called Senator Cullom back
from the strenuous life of Illinois. It
is to look after the new Senate annex,
provision for building 1 which was made
by Congress. It Is to provide offices
and committee rooms for the Senators
and Â¦will stand facing the park north
east of the Capitol, as the building
for the same purpose for members of
the House will stand to the southeast
ward. These buildings, to be built of
marble, will add greatly to the "court
of honor" effect sought In this con
nection. Both Senators and Repre
sentatives are greatly in need of office
room, the present Quarters of many of
them, even some holding important
committees, being: almost scandalous.
The new buildings will afford proper
committee as well as office room3 and
will be connected with the Capitol by
tunnels whereby they who wish may
pass from one to the other without
groing out into the weather.
The proposed extension of the east
front of the main building of the Cap
itol has been agreed upon by the joint
commission, also acting between ses
sions, according to the plans of Thomas
U.. Walter, desljrner of the wings and
the dome of the present building. This,
when completed, will add thirty-six
ofl:ce rooms. The Capitol building has
cost to date in construction $15,500,000.
The proposed extension will add $2,000,

Senator Stewart moved his furniture,
gathered from all over the world, to
a house at 1800 F street and set It up
there as best he could. Afterward he
let this house to Senator Spooner, and
himself, with his wife, moved Into

The castle was built of brick and

more money then for a winter home
than it is now. It became famous at

the rooms of an F-street auction-house

both given wide circulation, served to
advertise the sale. It did more than
thatâ It served to make public theTeel

toward the Senator himself and the
Senator's resentment, the occasion be-
Inf the Senator's second marriage. The
daughters having declared that It was
the Senator's Intention to sell the por

originally constituted, the Senator re
plied that this statement was not true:
that he had no Intention of selling any
keepsakes, much less the family por

had been allowed to go through the

and that they "had done so. but that,
not satisfied, they wished to make a
third culling from the stuff that con
tained no keepsakes and no portraits,
and to this he had said "No."

as she was crossing between the two
platforms at the local station one day
an express train came thundering down
upon her.
"She seemed to be dazed," said a
spectator, "and it. appeared for a mo
ment as though she , was certainly
doomed; but Frank, who was some dis
tance away, rushed forward on the
track and at the risk of his own life
grasped his " mother in his arms and
swung her bodily off the line just as

great pluck and presence of mind, but
Â¦when I expressed my admiration of
what he had done he simply remarked
that It was nothing â no more than any
body would have done under the cir

That feeling has characterized the
boy's attitude since the tragedy in
which he played such a dire part. After
killing his mother he carried his little
sister, Queenie, to whom he was de
voted, to a near by Inn, and said coolly
to the landladv: "Please take care of

A wife is suing in a local court for divorce on the
ground that her husband has cultivated a habit of tickling
her neck with a clasp knife, at the same time threatening
to send her where earthly cares will cease to sadden and
harass. While something may be said of the husband's
solicitation for nis better half's ; future, even'- a casual
observer must 'criticize; and condemn the means he has
chosen to achieve his end. ,/. ,Â£%>Â£%
In addressing a class of graduating schoolboys Presi
dent Roosevelt declared that what the nation needs. is
men, not prigs, and that the snob should be eliminated in

It is a congratulation that the advice is not necessary to

STRAY DOGâ A. S., City. The fact
that "a . dog follows a person to his
home and will not leave the house"
does not give that person an ownership
in the dog. The matter is governed by
the law of estrays which requires that
the person taking up the animal must
feed him and within- five days after he
comes in possession of the animal he
must notify. the County Recorder. Then
follows the manner of procedure which
entails the publication of notice of the
find and the sale of the animal if not
claimed within a stated time. The per
son who has taken up the animal i3
entitled to a reasonable compensation
for the care of it.
THE valley ' press expresses rather poignant disap
pointment with the recent ( river convention. In
some quarters the part^ taken Â¦ by the Promotion
Committee is objected to as indicating its partisanship of
Borne unrevealed plan. Perhaps the discontent is raised
by the fact that all the talk in the convention was con
fined to the flood evil and there was no discussion of a
remedy. So it is being said in the valley that the people"
did not have to wait for a convention to tell them that
there are floods caused^ by rainfall. They knew that
before.
They are indeed so familiar with it that it is a disquiet
ing subject. What they want is a remedy for the floods.
They admit that this cannot be in the form of a check
on the rainfall; nor in its more even distribution so
that the flood crest will not appear. The Â¦remedy must
be in diverting the floods to a basin large enough to hold
them, or in an artificial bayou: that will relieve the main
stream by giving it another mouth into Suisun Bay far
below its present one, or in widening its present mouth.
The people seem to have expected the convention to dis
cuss some of these plans, and- are disappointed that this
was not done. V ; : ':.' _ -^ -

The trial of a coolie leader of a local Chinese tong, ac
cused of the murder of one of his fellows, has developed
the startling fact that Mongol assassins, resident among
us, may barter for their lives with degenerate whites even
in a regularly constituted court of justice. This is not
the first illustration in San 'Francisca that contact with
an inferior race means. retrogression. The Chinese may
teach us even more evil than our craft may contrive.

HEADQUARTERS OF THE CALL.
I HENRIETTA STREET, COVENT
GARDEN, LONDON, May 20.â It is the
general opinion that few more extra
ordinary crimes have occurred in this
country than that committed by Frank
Rodgers. of whom the whole kingdom
is talking. Rodgers is, of course, the
15-year-old boy who murdered his
mother In the little town of Meldreth.
Cambridgeshire. Apart from its ghast
ly sensationalism the story presents
raany sensual features. Between the
bojr and his mother a strong attach
ment existed, which was so marked
that In the family he was known as
"mother's boy." Some three months be
fore he killed her at the imminent risk
of his own life, he saved her from being
run over by an express train. No quar
rrl between them, no outburst of pas
fion, preceded the fatal -deed. The boy's
t-iatetnent that he shot her because he
beard a voice commanding him to do
so and had no recollection of the firing
of the oistol imparts to the case u
strong element of psychological inter
est. At the preliminary examination,
at which the lad was remanded for,
trial, the remarkable spectacle was pre
sented of the widowed father, who is

It was in the middle of October,
1869, while roaming about Spain, that
the late Henry M. Stanley received a
telegram from James Gordon Bennett,
then in Paris, urgently, summoning
him to the French capital. Public
feeling in England and America had
been deeply stirred by conflicting re
ports of the safety of Dr. Livingstone,
then supposed by some to be travel
ing, and by others to be dead, in the
interior. In his book, "How I Found
Livingstone," Stanley thus relates
what occurred upon his arrival in
Paris:
Stanley's Orders.
An old man who robbed his life of not only every in

the other day and left to inquiring relatives property
valued at something considerably more than one million
dollars. Without motive worthy of emulation, the old
fellow found in existence an inspiration that would make
the career of most of us reasonably happy. The problem
of how to live well on nothing a year is still an annoy

"On the night I shot my mother,"
Frank told him, "I went homo and had
supper. Afterward I went upstairs and
got the revolver and went down to the
breakfast room. I felt an almost Ir
resistible impulse to ehoot mother. I
refrained, however, and went out. The
impulse came again and I went back
into the house. \ .
"A voice distinctly told me to do it.
It said: 'Do it, and do it quickly.' I
do not remember firing or pointing the
pistol, but I remember bearing a muf
fled report and then I stumbled against
the door. That is all I know about it."
He also told the doctor that for two
or three months he had been constant
ly haunted by the â¢ feeling that his
mother was dose behind him and that
when he turned his head he saw an
apparation of her which slowly van
ished.
Insanity will undoubtedly be' the de
fense at the \ trial, â- which will be
strengthened by the fact that a broth
er, of the dead woman was confined in
an asylum. Her own failing may be
attributed to heredity, for her father,
it has been stated, was a man, of in
temperate habits.. The boy is of rather
more ' than average intelligence ' and
much bigger than most boys of his
age, his recent growth having been un
usually rapid.
The most remarkable evidence was
that given by Dr. Octavius Ennion,
the family physician, who was sum
moned to. the house immediately after
Mrs. Rodgers had been shot. To him
the boy volunteered the statement Jhat
he had heard voices urging him to
murder his mother. -' -.'Â¦â*:
It was the influence of his mother's
example and upbringing on his little
sister that gave him most concern, al
though, according to the evidence, Mrs.
Rodgers had never ill treated, the
child. After shooting the mother he
told his eldest sister that he had done
it "for Queenie's sake." The mother
had given way to drink that day ana
after_ supper the family had left her
sitting in an arm chair in the break
fast room, half asleep. It was then
that Frank went upstairs, got a- re
volver belonging to his elder brother
and, returning with it, shot her.
Some of the witnesses testified that
he brooded much over his mother's in
temperance. To an acauaintance he
remarked that he hated the thought of
liquor, pathetically adding, "See what
it has done in our house." One day
at breakfastâ his mother had been in
toxicated the day before â he told the
family that he had dreamed during
the night that he had strangled her.

written an account of his Investigations

with special reference to date culture
m America. "The doctors seem
agreed," Mr. Fairchild says, "that
sweet things in excess are injurious to
the digestion, and the dentists claim
that sugar ferments between the teeth,
forming lactic acid, which attacks the
dentine; but, for all this, it is doubt
ful if there can be found a sounder,
stronger ru.ee, with better digestion and
finer, whiter teeth than the date-eat
ing Arabs. The remarkable physiqua
of the Arabs and their resistance to
the almost unbearable heat of their
country might be attributed in part,
at least, to the nature of their slmrle
food. At any rate, a thorough investi

of food for our hot summer season
should be made, and possibly this won

The Trade Bulletin reports that since the index was
sent out, a matter of two months ago, inquiries have
been received in this city for prices on certain cotton
goods, from Mexico asking for catalogues, prices and the
names of exporters of 'mining machinery, electrical sup
plies, wire, sawmill . machinery, dry goods, seeds, mica
and graphite; from Hamburg, Germany, for names of
dried fruit exporters; from Paris for the names of salmon
and fruit exporters.; from Toronto, Canada, and from
Hongkong for the names of exporters of miscellaneous
products. These inquiries have been referred appropri
ately to the persons who are engaged in the lines of busi
ness indicated. â '
>.' There is no doubt that thejudicious use of printer's, ink
can be made of great value to a State that has as much
to advertise as California. Heretofore efforts have been
largely confined to giving information relative to farm
ing, mini-;; and climate, together with the social con
ditions existing in this State. Now it is realized that the
position of California as a manufacturing center is as
sured by cheap' fuel and favorable geographical position
on the seaboard. It becomes, therefore, advisable to call
attention to what can be had here for export.
The lands that are washed by the waters of the Pacific
Ocean are the natural customers of the Pacific Coast
States." Any effect that may result from the Panama
canal to the trade of South America for manufactured
goods, South America being mainly east of New York
and the other great seaports of the Atlantic Coast of the
United States, it is morally certain that the. Pacific Coast
will always have an advantage in the islands of the Pacific
and in the great market that the Orient affords.
The Panama canal will compel the great transconti
nental railways to make sea rates between the points of
origination of freights and the Orient to meet the sea
rates by way of the Isthmus of Panama. Such goods as
can be made to better advantage in the East than in Cali
fornia or other Pacific Coast States will naturally be
favored by the transcontinental carriers that they may
secure pay for the long haul. That the railways are doing
now."
But the reports from the Pacific Commercial Museum
are encouraging. They show that California is consid-'
ered abroad to be on the commercial map as a manu
facturing and distributing center. As such its importance
will continue to grow. .This is a good time to let for
eign lands on the Pacific know what it can secure here,
and the means adopted to that end would seem to be
efficient and well adviseU
IT is gratifying to learn from the latest number of the
Foreign Trade Bulletin, which is published in this
city by the Pacific Commercial Museum, that prac
tical returns Jiave already been received from the issu
ance by the museum of a San Francisco trade index.
This index contains the names and addresses of the
many San Francisco firms who have united to promote
export trade on the Pacific Coast by the agency of the
Commercial Museum. It also carries a great variety of
information in the English and Spanish languages.
The purpose is to place before reputable importing
houses throughout countries that border on the Pacific
Ocean a reference book on the resources of California,
the manufacturing and distributing business of San Fran
cisco and the names of the members of the Commercial
Museum who are prepared to supply goods for which
there is a demand abroad. .'â¢>
While it was primarily intended to reach Spanish
speaking people, the book has also been distributed
throughout the Orient and Australasia and to all the
United States Consuls and to many foreign chambers of
commerce. Acknowledgments have been received from
many Consuls in foreign lands, who write that the publi
cation will assist them to answer inquiries regarding
California, its products of soil, manufacturing industries
and trade.

THE complexity of the Democratic situation is fur-r
ther revealed in the disclosures made by Mr. Cleve
land and by Mr. Murphy, the Tammany leader. Mr.
Cleveland makes it evident nowthat his single purpose
is to disclothe the party of the fashion it took on in
1896. He admits that in his opinion either Judge Gray
or Mr. Olney would make . a . stronger candidate than
Judge Parker, but more sentiment seems to be behind
Parker, and therefore he should be nominated in order
to make sure the defeat of Hearst.
The defeat of Hearst is twice put by Mr. Cleveland as
among the first duties of the party. He uses the term
"conservatives" as applied to all who are against Hearst,
and in conclusion speaks of the organfzation that is ex
pected to issue from the national convention as "the' new
Democracy." That' seems pushing the fight pretty far.
Mr. Bryan waited iri-1896 until he.- had captured the con
vention and the committee before he began calling his
organization a new party. Mr. Cleveland is either very,
confident of. conservative .control, or, with his ..usual
frankness and courage, he chooses to remove all doubt
of his position long in advance of the action and before
half of the delegates to the convention are chosen.
That part of the situation seems to be straight enough.
But when the Tammany position, as "declared by Mr.
Murphy, is laid alongside of Cleveland's straight line it
zigzags like summer lightning. Mr. Murphy says that
the head of a great corporation, which has often, sup
ported Tammany, has asked him to cease opposition to
Judge Parker, threatening to withdraw support if this is
not done. Thereupon Mi*. Murphy proclaims that he
takes his life in his hand and goes forth on an anti-
Parker crusade, to win or fall.
He declares that Mr.- Belmont has used the corpora
tion lobbies in~ the Southern States to secure delegates
for Parker, and this is undoubtedly true. It had already
been noticed in the States penetrated by the Southern
Railway, the Plant system and the Illinois Central. All
of those roads are in financial or sympathetic alliance
with the great lines that run west from New York and
Chicago, and back of them are ambushed the great pro
ductive combinations, which have thrown the gauntlet
down to President Roosevelt. This monster force is
more influential in a Democratic convention than it can
be at the polls. But that it does cherish the hope of
defeating President Roosevelt is apparent in the dis
closures made by Mr. Murphy and by the news agencies.
That the Democratic merger is represented by Mr.
Belmont is plainly evident. That choice is not at all un
wise, though Mr. Hearst, from a very superficial view,
has assumed that it is. Mr. Belmont left the Democratic
party in 1896, and when the country was wildly alarmed
by Bryanism consorted with those Republicans who ac
cepted Bryan's challenge and made sound money the'
paramount issue. Again in 1900 Mr. Belmont was off
the reservation and supported McKinley directly. While,
from a Democratic standpoint, the .coming of such a man
immediately into the responsible leadership of the party
is more than strange and unnatural, yet seen from the
situation which gives the only hope of Democratic suc
cess it is entirely logical and proper. . v '&& .
Ever since the trusts and' combines 'started' on 'a^hunt
for President Roosevelt's scalp it has been apparent that
they could not hit him through the Republican party.
Nor could they hope to use the Bryan organization for
that purpose. The only course left open to them was to
make use of the opportunity to elect delegates to the
Democratic .National Convention who would provide a
"transformation. That cpnvention is to be called to or
der as the old Democracy of 1896, and it will come to
order as something entirely different. It will be . the
new Democracy proclaimed by Mr. Cleveland. This
new Democracy, will be permitted to roar some and
gnash its teeth a little in the party prospectus, called its
platform," but it will be the political instrument, care
fully manufactured and tempered and tried by the trusts
and combinations with which to wreak their vengeance
upon President Roosevelt.
Even Mr. Hearst has been able to stop admiring his
own photograph long enough to see this and has wig
wagged the new merger to the effect that he is in favor
of the good trusts and combinations and is friendly to
legitimate wealth. As no responsive signal comes back
Mr. Hearst begins to fall out of the fight, for he knows
perfectly well that the alliance is made, that he sought
to be its candidate, and, failing in that, he knows that it
is useless for him to spend any more money in getting
delegates. In his recoil he not only closes his various
and brilliant .headquarters in many States, but gives up
his Washington residence, perhaps to go at light house
keeping in a fiat.
His practical abandonment of the field leaves it to the
new Democracy, the trusts and Judge Parker. Tam
many will pitch McClellan into the ring and he will be
pitched out again and the trusts will march against the
President behind the man from Esopus. Fortunately the
President is his own platform. He has brought the
wrath of the trusts to praise him by enforcing the laws
as fearlessly as he does all duties, and the people will
not be misled by platform words in the face of his deeds.
CLEVELAND AND PARKER.
but "as they come* from that part of y the State that is
most interested we repeat our first conclusion, that dis
cussion in this convention would have been better though
it only brought out the different remedies without adopt
ing any of them. Americans always like their day in
court and make compromises only after discussing
them. The committee that took charge of unknown and
undiscussed measures of relief will do wisely if h heed
the feeling' among the people concerned and take the
public into its confidence to a greater extent' than did
the, convention. j

PHILADELPHIA, May 30.â Patients
In their cots at the Samaritan Hospital
listened by telephone to a sermon in
the Grace Baptist Temple, more than
a mile away, yesterday. . '
It was the first practical application
of the telephone for this purpose. The
apparatus in the temple consisted of
five megaphones suspended from wires
with the larger ends reaching the pul
pit and the preacher. The "smaller
ends were closed and connected in the
ordinary transmitters.

OMAHA. May 30.â Willie Roberts,
the boy balloonist, made an ascension
this evening In spite of an injunction
obtained by his parents to restrain him
from engaging in the dangerous occu
pation.
Roberts, who is only about seventeen
years old, has been making ascensions
in this vicinity for two or three years.
His parents have always done their
utmost to prevent it. â¢
Last year he was engaged to make
regular ascensions at one resort. After
his parents succeeded in preventing
him fulfilling this contract he gave
dally exhibitions for a week at another
resort before his father learned what
he was doing. ' '/
Yesterday he appeared at the park,
dressed in tights and all preparations
were made for his ascension. Then the
injunction papers were presented to
the park management, holding it liable
if he were allowed to make the ascent.
The date was accordingly canceled and
another man was sent up.
To-day the lad begged permission to
make one more ascent. He holds the
local record for a long distance rise
and wanted to try to break, it- He
promised to retire from- the business
after this ascension until he becomes
of age.
Roberts has bought himself a balloon
and a parachute with the proceeds of
his exhibitions. ? *

BERLIN, May 30.â The annual Pan-
German CongTess at Luebeck to-day
took on the character of a sharp criti
cism of Emperor William and the sys
tem of personal government. Profes
sor Hasje, a former member of the
Reichstag, said the. best elements of
the people earnestly wished the Em
peror would choose advisers who had
the courage to ask him to spend at
least half the year at the capital, so
that they might daily confer personally
with him, without the intervention of
courtiers, and who would have the
courage to resicn when their advice
was disregarded. The professor's words
evoked great applause.
A resolution adopted by the congress
declares It is "imperatively necessary
f jt the political and business interests
of the empire to acquire a foothold on
the Atlantic Coast region of Morocco,
and the congress feels it to be a hu
miliating disregard of Germany that
France and Great Britain fixed the
future of Morocco without consulting
Germany, thus treating her like a
power of third rank."

Miss Keefe was the daughter of Mr.
and Mrs. Daniel Keefe of 1628 Union
street, San Francisco. The Keefes
were spending the summer at Goep
pert's villa. Miss Keefe was a tele
phone operator at the Palace HoteL
She came across the bay last evening
to remain over Decoration day with
her family. This morning after
breakfast she started to the baths.
Her brothers, George and John, had
preceded her and were swimming
when the accident occurred.
The body was found about forty feet
from the place where the young
woman was when the accident oc
curred. She was dead. Willing hands
conveyed her to Goeppert's villa and
Coroner Sawyer was notified.
The accident occurred at 11:07
o'clock, near Escalle station, the train
leaving San Rafael at 10:50 causing it-
Miss Keefe was crossing the tracks
near Goeppert's villa. The up-coun
try electric train had just passed and
a steam special picnic train was fol
lowing. A train en route to Sausali
to was due at the same time. , It is
presumed that Miss Keefe heard the
steam train approaching, but could
not hear the oncoming electric train.
A curve in the road would also ob
struct her view. She stepped off one
track and on to the other, but as the
electric train came the car struck Miss
Keefe in the back of the head. Her
body was hurled upward and her head
struck a large brass alarm bell on
the motor car, breaking it off.
Motorman Driscoll saw the girl and
knew the collision was inevitable. Just
as his car struck Miss Keefe he threw
on the brakes and fainted. The train
stopped after eight of the ten cars
passed over the girl's body.
SAN RAFAEL, May 30. â While en
route to Join her brothers in swim
ming at Escalle . baths, Miss Lillie
Keefe, a pretty blonde, 19 years of
age, was struck by an electric train
on the North Shore Railroad to-day
and instantly killed.

A Preparation DiacoTcred That Will JJe-
Â¦'Â¦"- Â«troy the Dandruff Oerm.
For some' time it has been known that
dandruff ls caused by a germ that digs
up the scalp into little white Cakes, and
by sapping the vitality of the hair at the
root, causes falling hair. and,. of course,
finally baldness. ' For .years there have
been all kinds ,of hair stimulants and
scalp tonics on the market, but there has
been no permanent cure for dandruff un-
til the discovery of a preparation called
Newbro's Herpldde, which destroys the
dandruff germ. Destroy, the cause, the
effect will cease to exist. Kill the dan-
druff germ and you'll have no dandruff,
no itching scalp, no falling hair. Sold by
leading druggists. Send 10c in stamps for
sample to The Herpicide Co., Detroit,

A gold dollar has greater value than a Mexican silver
'dollar, because it is of better quality.
So it is with the many sales that are now being adver-
tised â they have not the true ring of the genuine article.
My sale has the true ring, because I am under contract
toÂ»Â«nrrender possession of my store to Olson Bros,, Grocers,
onithe 15th day of July. I have still on hand
$150,000
Worth of Choice Dry Goods
At the Marked-Down Prices, to be disposed of in thirty-
eight working days. Therefore, I must sell FOUR THOU-
SAND DOLLARS' worth of goods every day for the next
thirty-eight days, in order to clean out my stock.
Prices Alone Will Do It.
The PUBLIC MUST be convinced of, the truth of- my
assertion when I say that I MUST give them Two Dollars'
Worth of Merchandise for One Dollar in coin; and to the
public I say, come and investigate, and the success of my
undertakingatvill be assured.
Will open this morning at 9 o'clock and for the ensuing
week will concentrate all our energies (I might say in giving
away â prices are so low) on the immense stock of Blankets,
Quilts, Table Linens, Towels, Napkins, Dress Goods, Silks,
Suits, Skirts, Jackets, Shirt Waists, Hosiery, Underwear,
Fancy Goods and Notions.
Be on Hand for theTBargairis.
* Not in a lifetime will such an opportunity be presented.
The attention of the Dressmakers is called to our large
stock of best quality Linings and Trimmings, of all kinds, at
closing-out prices. - -

BORAXOLOGY
You might say that
Boraxology is a soap and
water ' science. When you
talk to people about wash- .
ing scientifically they may
smile if they don't Know.
If they do know, they'll
simply see that their sup- â¢
ply of BORAX is all right,
' and look happy. The ques-
tion of wasnmg is a ques-
tion of chemistry; of nard
water or soft water. Borax
softens water and thereby
doubles its cleansing
power. For toilet, bath,
laundry, whenever you use
?Â¦ soap and water add a little
Borax. But get it pureâ

ALAMEDA, May 30.-â Two " rowboat
loads of merrymakers, including a
cumber oi prominent people of this
city and San Francisco, were lost on
San Leandro Bay for a time last night
and it waVnot until early this morning
that they made -it landing near High
street. The boats were rented last
evening from F. Fittock at the Park
street bridge and after the passengers
were seated . ther pulled up the canal
toward Melrose.
After passing San Leandro Bay the
amateur mariners grew confused by
the lights and in their efforts to reach
the vacht Mist, anchored off the Bay
Farm Island bridge, lost their bearings.
When the boats finally effected a land
ing near High street all hands were
exhausted and chilled. Among those in
the party were Fred Wilbur and his
two sisters of this city. Miss Sadler of
San Francisco and Fred Murphv, also
of San Francisco. After reaching shore
the young people were cared for at the
Wilbur home. â¢

Bent and jrray with years, the fast

And youngest of all, the children cf
the public schools contributed tokens
of remembrance when in childish har
mony their voices lifted in patriotic
song while they strewed the graves
of soldier dead with loving tributes of
beautiful nowers. Not a resting plac<5
in the sacred homes of peace was for
gotten. Over every humble mound
andÂ» at every stately* mausoleum that
marked a soldier's burial place waved
the Btars and stripes, garlanded with
many flower emblems. And when the
last word had been spoken and the
last song offered, the soldiers living
fired their volleys of salute and' the
mournful/ cadences of the 'buglers'
"taps" wafted sweetly through the
soughing trees, the final touch of mil

Masonic Home Boys' band preceded a
reading of Lincoln's Gettysburg ad
dress by Philip Langan. In his re
marks,' United States Senator Perkins
said:.
This assemblage and the memories of the
day. It seems to me. should serve to allay the
prejudices and Dasstons, If any exist, of the
sreat conflict that closed nearly forty years
a~o. There are < with us to-day those who
wore the gray, as well as those who wore the
blue. In the i great Civil War. There are with
us to-day those who went forth in the recent
war to fight for humanity and. to assist a sis
ter republic In her struggle against oppresnlon.
They maVched elbow to elbow under the stars
and stripes to the tunes of "Yankee Doodle"
and "Dixie." , â¢ â¢ ; â¢ . .
It 'seems as If nature is speaking to us in
the entwlDlns; of her beautiful flowers together
over the graves of those that fought Â¦ for the
gray and those that fought for the blue. When
death comes - all animosities, bitterness and
human enmity should , be burled. We want a
happy and united . country. We want good
will an'd amity between every section and the
friendship and co-operation' of every good citi
zen in working : for the ' betterment of all of
tho people of our common country.
: It Is an Inspiring thought that the great
army you. veterans of the Civil War, repre
sent > f ouch t not to enslave, but to . make . free
those in bondnce: fougHt not to ; destroy." but
to save a nation. . If ,'we will strive to emulate
the virtues , of the noble . men . who have gone
we will- leave this sacred spot after our devo
tions .better equipped for our conflict In the
battle of. life and. to do our duty as American
citizens. ' "... , , ..
CHILDREN SING.
'â¢School^children sang "America" as a
prelude to Henry C. Dibble's oration.
Judge Dibble -reviewed the organiza
tion of the Grand Army of the Repub
lic, and the 'birth and growth of Mem
orial 'day and- its observance.
â¢He said in part: :
â¢ The ' day â¢ is ' In Â¦. truth a fpstlval " to loyalty
and : to the memory, of the loyal . dead. Â¦ If our
country ls,to live . and move forward among 1
the free and enlightened 'nations of the earth.
It â¢ is altogether proper that ' this ' day should
be devoted to these symbolic ceremonies ana
be kept . sacred . to . patriotic and Â¦ loyal senti
ments. -Â¦.-Â¦Â¦-,: ; Â¦
Â¦ The â¢ people have adopted Memorial day and
It has become a national holiday in; the high
est end i truest sense. It Is a legal ; holiday * In'
thirty-eight States and .territories Including
the District ' of - Columbia. Of . these five an-
Southern border Â¦ States and one Â¦ State 'Â¦ Ten-'
neasee. is in the heart of the South. There
is a marked disposition of the country to
frown upon desecration of the day. . .
-I. believe v the time Is near^at -hand when
Memorial day will become universally recog
nized.as a day sacred to the memory of those
who have born* arms for the country 'and will
be I devoted to the Inculcation of . and explana ;
tion of patriotic and loyal sentiments, ;Â¦ r

' Friends, of.- one thine you may be . certain
when you come to the graves ' of the men who
fought for American liberty, and . that thing
is thlaâ they responded to the call of duty la
accordance with <that privilege which moved
God to make man in his own image. Â¦ Â¦ â¢-.
â¢ The nm essential -to right order is freedom.
A nation of . free men Â¦ Is to my mind a scene
ot transcendent beauty, upon which the anzeU
love - to gaze- with; enraptured delight. The.
men whoFu bones are to molder In thl3 plat

cated here also that the angels might have a

Lincoln's Gettysburg . address was
read - by County Superintendent of
Schools T. O. Crawford. J. F. McCue,
a graduate of St. Mary's College, â¢ gave
an eloquent address entitled "Memorial
Day Thoughts." The young speaker
touched his' hearers by the: sweetness
and beauty of his well -chosen remarks.
The oration was delivered by the iRev.
J. B. McNally, pastor of St. . Patrick's
Church, West* Oakland. Father McNal
ly's tribute to the departed was a mag
nificent effort, concluding with an orig

an Jacob Wlnkler, with Sergeant
Sherwood and Corporal Duesler assist
ing'. The Veteran Reserve fired a salute
to the flag.
Chairman Jacob Wlnkler introduced
John E. McElroy as president of the
day. In a stirring address President
McElroy gave heed to the pride Ameri
cans should feel. in their country's his
tory.: He said the fathers of the nation
had learned the lesson in a severe
school of. adversity that violation of
Just rights of man; was tyranny, and
they, had formed a union to free them
selves from it. The orator continued:
It In- beautiful and proper ' that a day like
this should: be set- apart for observance and
that' expression be given ' to feelings of love
and of grief, and the sentiments of patriotism
should ; be awakened by the presence of sol
diers. 11 vlmr. at' the. graves of soldiers dead.
In dedicating this last resting place I shall
not refer to the great conflict between tht
North and the South to disparage the South
ern ' soldier. He " fought " conscientiously. He
-was a brave and a generous foe. And now.
with: the passing of the years the 'storm and
strife have gone and the Northern soldier â¢ gives
his hand in full" meed of praise to his chlval
rlc foe. Thank God to-day, no sear is vlslbiÂ»

Young McKenny was the son of Mr.
end Mrs. H. A. McKenny of 760 Bryant
Eireet, San Francisco, and with his
chum. Crutamesh, came to Alameda for
an outing. The boys went to the Wal

eid. His- companion tried in vain to
reach him. H. L. McKenny, the boy's
lather, came to Alameda immediately
en1 with former Senator E. K. Taylor
cnii H. A. Hebbard dragged the chan
nel for the Â¦body. Up to this evening
thev had not located the remains. In
tpeakins of his son's death McKenny
paid: "It was always Prentice's am
bition tw learn how to swim and it was
'ti:y inten'^on to have him take lessons
this summer. He did not know the
first thing about swimming, but when
ever he pot an oppo:tunky 10 wade or
Toddle he never overlooked it." '
ALAMEDA, May 30.â His ambition to
learn how to swim cost thirteen-year

Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1118 Broadway, May 30.
The annual picnic of St. Anthony's
parish drew a great crowd to Idora
Park this afternoon. It was not a
typical California day by any means,
for the wind I flirted with the dust all
day, but that did not keep the-thou
sands of adults and children from hav
ing a good time. The scenic railway,
the merry-go-round and the coal mine
were patronized by big and little and
everybody entered into the spirit of
the fun. Many brought baskets of
lunches and picnicked under the trees, i
while others took their tea^and crack
ers at the Japanese teahouse or their
I pink lemonade at the regular stand
tor that soft drink.
There was a baseball game and races
i for prizes in the afternoon on the cam
pus. The baseball game was stirring
and uncertain up to the very last
inning. Baseball was followed by the
athletic contests. Thin men and fat
men, old men and young m<*u and ladles
that weren't men at elJ tried for
prizes. They were a queer lot of com
petitors and pÂ«-ovided an immense lot
of amusement to the interested crowd.
â¢ But there was a serious side to it all â
one serious side that helped to balance
some of the -frivolity and a send people
away thinking of weightier things.
This .was the speech of Rev. P. C.
YorUe. who delivered the address of
the day from the bandstand. Fathef
Yorke spoke of the significance' of Me
morial day and of the duty the people
owe to the nation's dead. In the midst
of the bustle and hurry of modern life,
he said, it is not for us to forget.

ALAMEDA. May 30.â Joseph G. Price,
a veteran of the Civil War. claims that
his son. George L. Price, 4s being held
for debt by Howard K. James, a bill
collector of this city, and that the
young man has been a prisoner ever
since last Saturday. On that day James
arrived here from Burson. Calaveras
County, with young Price in custody.
The elder Price believed that his son
was in Burson, and was surprised this
morning when he opened the store that
had been formerly conducted by the
young man at 2307 Central avenue to
find him a prisoner therein and in the
custody of James.
James had sued the younger Price to
recover $15t>, and on last Thursday ob
tained from City Justice R. B. Tappan
a warrant for the arrest of Price.
Armed with this James went to -Burson
and explained to Price that it would be
well to come to Alameda and arrange
to make good what he was sued for.
Price consulted with relatives, who
said they would try to raise the money.
James then brought Price here, and
told the latter that if his relatives
would raise the amount sued for he
would not take Price to prison, but
would permit him to stay at his
(James') house. Ever sines his arrival
here Price has been directly under the
eye of James an 1 , has been confined in
the bill collector's house anti in his own
store. .In speaking of the .natte-- *nc

ALAMEDA, May 30.â Miss Annie
tfeebeck, a young woman employed In
the family of Christian D. Postel, 1206
Broadway, was attacked and brutally
beaten shortly after midnight last
night by a lone thus, who sprang upon
the girl from a cornfield as she was
walking along Encinal avenue, near
Regent street, toward the residence of
her employeis. Not . satisfied with
knocking down and kicking his weak
victim once, the desperado assailed her
a second time and then, becoming
alarmed at her screams for help, made
his escape in the darkness.
- Miss Seebeck had been visiting
friends Jn San Francisco and alighted
from the last South Side local train
that arrived at 12: 25 o'clock. She was in
cumbered with a number of packages,
which she carried in her arms. "When
the young woman approached a field
or corn on Encinal avenue, near Re
gent*Street; she was startled. by a man
who 'jumped at her from the tall
growth of corn. He said notlling, but
swung at her viciously and hurled her
into the gutter.
As she fell Miss Seebeck threw one
of -her packages at ner assailant. It
contained a bottle of ink and this
was broken, the contents being scat
tered over the sidewalk and the young
woman's hat. While Miss Seebeck lay
prostrate her brutal assailant kicked
her several times and when she cried
with pain he said: "What's the matter
with you?"
Then the thug left his .victrm a*d
she arose and prueeefled. toward- her
destination. Her assallant'ln.thp.mean
time had traveled aiound tlie block and
when MisÂ« Seebeck neared the Postel'
home Â»he was again confronted by the
nocturnal thus. She screamed at the
top of her volco and'hc-rled. Upon *nr
teringth* house Mis?; Seebeck r^ated
her experience and Gorirs P*oatel â¢ went
to the t-pot where the. attack occvr.nJ
and secured tlu.-bu r *\les that had fallSr.
from thÂ« young woman's crms. l"fc.irol
man Fred Braropton. who" had fcis-#t-.

THE FUTURE REVEALED, THE PAST
DISCLOSED. i
Tbe Present Analyzed by Livingstone.
PROF. LIVINGSTONE'S readings are like
a living page of Flammarlon'e treatise that is
â¢o electrifying the world to-day.- He Is no
imitator. His work is upon original lines,
pure thought, clear vision. He tells you what
you desire to know and works in "the open
light.
He is as conspicuous for his wonderful oc-
cult analysts as he is for. his original ex-
pression and vivid trutbfulness.
A test reading Is not a life reading. When
you call on PROF. LIVINGSTONE he will
give you a full life reading for $1. A test Is
of little value; when the mind is troubled you
need more substantial aid and advice. This
is Just what PROF. LIVINGSTONE gives
you when you call on him for a first-class
clairvoyant reading. Â¦
He asks you no questions, but tells you
wha,t you wish to know.
He does not mention all the ills and mis-
fortunes you ore heir to. You are acquainted
with the facts in your case. Let PROF.
LIVINGSTONE analyze the matters that are
troubling you, find the cause at trouble and
suggest the Temedy. '

SAN JOSE. May 30.â Angelo Tolo
niei was arrested at Gilroy to-day for
robbing the Catholic church at that
place last Fridiiy night. His booty
consisted of the 'poor box, which was
wrenched loose from its fastenings and
carried away. Just how much cash
the box contained is not known. The
box is opened onfy once in six months,
the last time it was emptied being
about four months ago. Suspicion
pointed to Tolomei, who had been
loitering' about the town. He was lo
cated on a near by ranch and a piece
of the box was found in his pocket.
Tolomei was brought to the County
Jail to-day to answer' a charge of bur

NEW .YORK, May 30.â It needed only
fair* weather for a- record-breaking
crowd to gather to-day within the
Graresend racecourse. Never before in
iy> history has there been such an at
tendance. Long before the second race
it was found necessary to let the over
flow from the field stand cross the
course to the infield. All along the
rails spectators were twenty deep from
the head of the stretch to the finishing
point. Forty thousand persons were
present. As for scenes in the betting
ring, they, beggared description. Men
fought to reach the bookmakers, and
many gave up the struggle in despair.
The most important flat race was the
Hudson stakes,* for two-year-olds. L.
V. Bell's Glorifler, with a penalty which
brought his weight up' to 125 pounds,
won. Diamond, an added starter, car
ried 115. Right Royal 115, Veto 112 and
Jake Sanders 115. In spite of this con
cession Glorifier was the logical odds
on favorite. j
At the start, which was 'not a good
one. Diamond burst away with a lead
of a length and a half on the favorite.
Diamond hugged the rail, while Glori
fler lost ground on the stretch turn,
but Gannon rode hard and closed the
gap steadily. In' the last sixteenth it
seemed certain Bell's colt would win,
and he did after a hard ride in the fast
time of l;00 5*3. Summary:

CHICAGO, May 30.â Cold, threaten
ing weather and a muddy track kept
the attendance at Hawthorne to-day
below the average for a holiday. Two
stakes on the card were attractive.
The Flight stakes, at six furlongs, was
practically ruined by scratches, while
the Prairie stakes, two miles, had only
a -'small field of starters. Out of the
ten original entries only four faced the
barrier in the Flight stakes, which de
veloped a dangerous Derby candidate
in S. C. Hildreth's Burleigh, which was
second choice in the betting at 2 to 1.
He made u show of his field, winning
by five lengths, pulled up, from C. R.
Ellison's Skilful, at .4 to 1. Barney
Sqhreiber's Sylvia Talbot, favorite at
â¢11 to 20, finished a distant third. ,
Potheen, the 9 to 10 favorite, won the
Prairie stakes without being pressed.

Immediately after coaling to Blueflelds, | In con

fishermen's claims against Nicaragua.
According to her story she partook
at dinner Thursday evening of straw
berries and cream. About ten minutes
later she was seized with intense pains
in the abdomen, which doses of whisky
and other home remedies failed to alle
viate. Bhe attempted to summon her
regular physician. Dr. E. R. Bryant,
but an urgent eurgica! caae prevented
him from responding. Mrs. Harper says
that the &ains continued with increas
ing agony until between 2 and 3 o'clock
Friday morning, at which hour her
landlady, Mrs. Frank Swigert. suggest
ed that the surgeon at the Park Hos
pital be sent for. Mrs. Swigert accord
ingly called up the institution by tele
phone and later reported to Mrs. Har
per that the surgeon would not come.
The suffering woman did not receive
treatment until after 9 o'clock next
morning, when Dr. Bryant called, and
she says that he told her her life had
been endangered.
It was learned yesterday that the
purgeon In charge on Thursday night
Mas Dr. G. H. Bockowitz. Last night
he stated to The Call that he had not
received Mrs. Harper's summons for
attendance. Upon hearing of her com
plaint he had investigated and found
that the nurse. Mrs. Davidson, had
been awakened by the telephone at an
early hour Friday morning, but when
she answered the call was informed by
central that the person calling had left
the "phone. The doctor, then asleep."
was not disturbed nor notified of the
oalL
Dr. Boskowitz Raid further that it Is
the rule of the hospital for the surgeon
to go nut only with the ambulance on
an ambulance call, but he would prob
ably have â¢ responded to an emergency
rase such as Mrs. Harper's is repre
sented to have been had he received the
call.
Dr. J. I. Stephen, chief surgeon <nf the
emergency hospitals, investigate the
â¢"Â¦ase of Mrs. Harper, and his resultant
report corroborates the statement of
Dr. Boskowitz.
"But." said Stephen, "assuming that
this person really at*ked for attendance
as stated, 1 will say that the emergency
surgeon certainly would not have been
allowed to go. It. was purely a medical
case, and the woman had* been sick
rince 6 o'clock the evening' before. It is
not the duty of the emergency eurjreon
to leave the hospital under any condi
tions except with the ambulance on a
hurry ca.ll, such as accidents demand.
It is absurd to think that he should
attend to medical cases. If he did, with
all the people in the park district, he
would soon have a very large practice.
I have made thSs ruling: for the sur
peons at the hospitals and am fully
supported by the Board of Health."
Mary L. Harder, a cloak and suit
saleswoman, formerly with the Golden
Rule store, declares that *he might
have died last Thursday night because
of the refusal cf the surgeon at the
Park Emergency Hospital to respond
to her call for immediate medical at
tendance. Mrs. Harper rooms , and
boards at S04 Stanyan street, which Is
directly across the street from the hos
pital."

The Rev. Miles B. Fisher, speaking

had not learned the fellowship of the
saints.
Were Jesus here he would charge upon us
the sin of idolatry, for we are too much
Eiven to the worship of a certain Frenchman
earned John Calvin.
If Jesus were here he would protest against
the Methodin Episcopal church South: spend
ing so much manhood and money where they
are not needed. He would say to my church,
"Don't operate in those fields where the Meth
odiFt Episcopal church belongs and Is doing
th" work. Don't spend millions of dollars in
the North, but take that same money and use
It for the r proad of the gospel among- thote
people who know not that I have died."
The Rev. Richmond Logan, speaking
for the Presbyterian church, said: v â¢
The Rev. Dr. Larkin. speaking for
the Methodist (North) Episcopal
Church, said that if Christ were here
to-day he could find many faults with
the sx>eaker himself and those whom
he was addressing. The faults, he said,
that are found with the church are but
proof of its growth and strength. He
denied that there was ever a time when
the church was more in harmony or a
time when the people ecclesiastically
organized were more moral or had
higher purposes of good will.
The Rev. P. C. Fletcher of the Meth
odist Episcopal Church South said:
The Rev. Mr. Whitaker, who is 'pas
tor of the Twenty-third-avenue Bap
tist Church. East Oakland, continued:
' If I ever thought Jesus waa a Baptist I
put that notion away Ions ago with childish
things. Neither tvas Jesus a Methodist nor
Presbyterian, a Protestant or Catholic. Our
little systems are but broken light* of his
vision of the truth. But. Just where his crit
icism of the orpar.if.rd piety of our day would
fall I do not know. I am quite sure He
would be out of sympathy with denominational
braggadocio of every sort. The average de
nominational conference would weary him with
its emphasis of externals and incidentals, and
Its exaggerated denominational self-conscious
ness. He would offend some good Baptists to
day by his Indifference to baptism and the
Ixsrd'e I cupper, and others by his insistence
upon the golden rule. He would say less than
some of ua car* to nay about watrr and more
than some .of us dare to say about . Standard
Oil. His message would bÂ«: Religion is a ltfe
of love, a law of social service, an inner
spiritual experience of the grace of God, which
is joy and peace.
"If Jesus were here to-day what
would he protest against In the or
ganized piety which I represent?".
. "If Christ were here to-day/' said the
Rev. - Robert Whitaker to the '. union
meeting of the Ministerial Association
yesterday, "it would not surprise me
were he found In the labor union, or, if
I dare say it, at Sunday picnics. I
think he would be found with the com
mon people." -. â¢ -
The suggestion came through a
query to the evangelical ministers:
\ So far. about 570 has be^en picked up
[by various persons. at or near the spot
(where the fleeing robber left his cart
i and took to the brush.' For several
I hours after the robbery he must have
i been lying out in the brush within 200
\ feet of the well-traveled Auburn and
i Newcastle county road.
AUBURN. May 30.â Four days have
passed since the Placer County 'Bank
was robbed in broad daylight here and
the robber is still at large. Sheriff j.
Charles Keena hurried home on being
apprised of the hold-up and has taken
personal charge of the man hunt.
The little son of . S. A. McKinstry
found in the brush the pistol" carried
by the robber \ylien he made his gun- j
play in the bank. --. It is a short 22- j
caliber weapon containing six cham- J
bers, one cartridge having: been dis- {
charged. The robber fired one shot in!
the bank building at McFadyen, the]
bookkeeper, and the six-shooter was i
picked up at a spot where it is be- |
lleved the desperado, was in hiding. !

Motor Boat Japansky Prove* Fast.
NEW YORK. May 30.â W. H. Wal
dorf's automobile racing launch Japan
sky, driven by a forty-horse power en
gine, won the first prize in the first
boat race of the season to-day over a
course of 19% miles with a turn on J
Long Island Sound. The Japansky de
feated with ease the other three boats
with automobile engines, the Flat, the
Shooting Star and the Panhard. cov
ering the 19?a miles in one hour and
six minutes and twenty-nine seconds.
W. K. "Vanderbilt Jr.'s motor boat was
entered, but in speed tests before the
race his boat and the Panhard came
near colliding. Mr. Vanderbilt Jam
med his tiller down so hard to avoid
a collision that his steering gear was
disabled and he withdrew his boat.
Coroner Flaherty proposes to make
a thorough ; Investigation of the- case
when the inquest is held on Wednes
day evening. A negro woman In Navy
street volunteered "the information that
the father of the child had sent a law
yer to see Susan Johnson and advise
her. and on his advice she would refuse
to throw any light on the child's real
Identity. '
The child attended school. She was
pretty and attracted the attention of
strangers on the street. A physician's
wife, whose name could not be learned,
made an attempt to get the child away
from its squalid surroundings by ask
ing the negro woman to permit her to
adopt it." The suggestion was met with
a refusal.. The woman told the physi
cian's wife that the child was that of a
well-known society woman on the
heights,- and was born in the home of
it's grandmother, on Clinton street, to
be abandoned soon afterward. t
At the Clinton-street address given
by the negress stands an apartment
house, and no one there remembered
any tenant whose description fitted that
given* by Susan Johnson of the child's
mother.
NEW 1*ORK, May 30.â Determined
efforts are being made to conceal all
facts concerning tbe parentage or early
life of 8-year-old "Elizabeth Beatrice
"Warren." the beautiful white child who
was burned to death in a negro hovel
on Saturday night. Susan Johnson,
the woman who cared for the child
since it was born, sent a telegram in
forming the father of the fatality aa
soon as she learned of its death. Who
the father is the woman declines to
say, and under police pressure she said
she had not heard from the child's
mother during the last six years.
That the child's life has been one of
misery there is no doubt. The negroes
along the block were unanimous in
there statements that there was no
question that the little one was far
better off now that her sufferings were
at an end. She was a cripple, but how
she became so no one apparently
knows.

party left the wharf at 10 a. m. and
returned at 5:30 p. m. The party was

of the boat aboard and he took the
most sheltered course possible. He
took them past the Presidio, Sausalito,
through the Raccoon Straits to San
Quentin, where* the prison band came
aboard and played several airs suitable
to the occasion. The boat then went to
El Campo and came ttr anchor for^ two
hours, where dancing, singing "and
general frolic reigned and the party
was thoroughly satisfied and enthu
siastic over the day's sport.

ifctoratlves were applied. '
A new face^ â comparatively new â ap
peared at the Alcazar last evening
fresh' from the picturesque dramatic
glories of the soul-stirring Central, and
it was a good one, that of Edwin T.
Emery, who had a good deal to say
and do as the villain, Captain Snell,
in "The Tollgate Inn." He was a har
binger of melodrama and brought with
him the booming of cannon, the crack
of musketry, the clattering of horses'
hoofs and a thunder storm.
Maude Adams â but how j may one
capture the winged and willful sweets
of her Lady Babbie? One may say she
has a face of. April grace, a distract
ing eyebrow, a witching smile, hands
that weave lyrics, a voice like a thrush.
Again one may say she realizes whol
ly the elfin humor of Lady Babble, the
caprice, the untamed sweetness, the
womanly depth of the pretty creature.
And one cannot Imagine her for a-mo
ment anything else. She is utterly
identified with the character. One re
calls, however, some, scenes with pecu
liar delight, as when she teases, wor
ships, orders about the little minister
in Nannie's cottage. Then her recep
tion, of the news that by Scots law
the Lady Babbie is married to the min
ister â such arch, delicate, triumphant
comedy is this. Her. blarneying of her
deceived papa â but throughout Miss
Adams is victoriously bewitching, and
one hears her lark-like laughter echo
ing long after the curtain falls.
As Gavin Dishart, Henry Ainley had
the right idyllic accent. He was man
ly, boyish, romantic and byronlcally
handsome. Nannie Webster was admir
ably played by Mrs. W. G. Jones, and
the four elders were flawlessly Scotch
and fully humorous in the, hands of
John H. Bunny, G. Harrison Hunter,
Richard Pitman and William Hender
son, though the whole cast can be re
called only with entire satisfaction. It
Is "The Little Minister's" week.
BLANCHE PARTINGTON.
â¢ . â¢ â¢
. Alcazar.
Perhaps it was unfortunate, perhaps
fortunate, that Miss Adams' play had
been seen here before. The attractiqn
of novelty was of course absent, but
there was the 'always fascinating op
portunity of comparison.
Still there were seats left last night â
that the speculator will probably be
paying gold for before the week Is
out. For, in spite of its lack of novelty,
in spite of its mediocrity as a play,
"The Little Minister" plus Maude
Adams and her excellent company
simply bewitched the audience. â¢
The sketchy, performance given by
the Grand Opera-house stock company
some time ago, with, however, earnest
and clever principals in Laura Nelson
Hall and Herschel Mayall, gave little
more than a hint of the play's.possibil
ities. Last night everything was in
favor of Mr. Barrle's comedy, from the
delicious Lady Babbie of Miss Adams
to the. last braw bit of Scotch on the
tongue of. Elder Whamond. Scenically,
beginning with. the cottage of Nannie
Webster, with its picturesque loom, the
production is perfect, and there isn't a
flaw in the cast. .
Shelley, perhaps, might fit " Maude
Adams into a lyric; dull prose can
never tell the charm of her. Last
night, after many years of absence,
she reappeared here "at the Columbia
Theater in "The Little Minister," in
which, as Lady Babbie, she made her
first national success now six years
ago in New York. It was impossible to
avoid a vicarious pride in the fact that
San Francisco discovered Miss Adams.
To my respected confrere, Mr. Peter
Robertson, belongs the honor, when in
her performance as Adrienne in "A
Celebrated Case" he discerned in the
small girl that spirituelle charm and
humor that now so delightfully dis
tinguish the actress. . ' ;
An attorney of prominence in San
Francisco, who makes hto home In
Oakland, is said to be guilty of a
breach of trust which -will require his
appearance aa defendant at,a hearing
of the case In the local courts In June.
The complainant, according to the
story from across the bay, will be Ma
dame Cecile do Lou, a masseuse at the
Lurline Baths on Bush street.' It is
alleged that the woman at one time
owned the property at 826 Ellis street,
valued at $15,000. As friend and ad
viser, it is alleged, the laim^er received
from her a diamond, watch and other
presents and that she \ made a will
leaving him her estate. It is also said
that upon two occasions she borrowed
$1500 from him and as security gave
a deed, to be recorded after her death,
to her property, then worth $12,000.
Whatever may be the merits of her
case, Madame do Lon is not inclined
to discuss them, at least for publica
tion. "When not plying her profes
sion of kneading the pliant flesh of
her patrons at the Lurline she makes
her home at 127 Olive avenue. She
was not at home last night to callers,
much less to interviewers. A third
party conversation held with her last
night, through the mediums of a small
crack in the door of her domicile and
an accommodating old lady to carry
