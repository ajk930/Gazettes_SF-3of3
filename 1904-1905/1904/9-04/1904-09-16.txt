McGjjcghegan was City Treasurer
for five years. About the first of last
March a shortage was found in his
office, and he was at once suspended
by Mayor Worswick. Later â¢ he j-e
pjgned. Nearly $10,000 of license
money collected by McGeoghegan was
missing. "When accused of taking the
money he denied it and protested his
innocence all along'. McGeoghegan
was not allowed a deputy In the office
and. he employed one himself. This
deputy during the trial also denied
taking the money.
A suit is now pending against the
United States and American bonding
companies, which were on McGeoghe
pan's bond, for the amount of the
ehortage in the treasury-
This practically frees McGeoghegan
of any wrongdoing in office, as' the
only charge that can now be made
against him is that of falsifying the
records. There is some doubt whether
he cculd be convicted on that. The
verdict to-day was received with ap
plause.

NEW YORK. Sept. 15.â A number of
lives were lost, much property dam
aged and several ships wrecked in the
storm which ravaged the Atlantic
coast last night and to-day.
The greatest loss of life was near
Wilmington. Del. ""The ' tug Israel W.
Durham, with a crew of six men and
four other men,. employes of the Amer
ican Dredging Company, was swamped
in the Delaware River early to-day,
during the height of the storm. Eight
of the ten persons on the little craft
were drowned. From farther down the
ccastâ Jacksonville â comes the report
that five men were drowned off
Charleston. This report was brought
in by one of the coast liners. New York
suffered comparatively little. The wind
and rain and thunder and lightning
were terrific, but little actual damage
was done. Nineteen coal barges went
adrift in the bay and to-night their
wreckage Btrews the shore from the
Battery to the Narrows, but no lives
were lost. Several small vessels also
went ashore on various parts of the
coast near New York. One fatality was
reported In this city, when a piece of
cast iron flre escape was blown from
a building and struck Carl Hertznock,
killing him instantly. A fishing steam

President Orders
Dismantling
of Lena.
Everything on board- the â¢" Russian
transport Lena was going on as quietly
as possible y^terday. 3 The orders from
Washington , to the effect that she was
to be dismantled seemed to have very
little effect. upon either the. officers or
the crew. Whatever they thought upon
the subject they kept to themselves.
Their countenances were as stolid as
on the day they arrived here: They
moved about the decks in that same
easy going fashion that has . marked
their movements since the Lena has
been in port. The only outward signs
of life on Â¦ the Lena was the ' scraping
of her hull, which | had become .green
and mossy .and bore a' dirty, brown ap
pearance. This Is . now being trans
formed by. the crew Into a brilliant
black. Boats on "all sides were en
gaged In this occupation.
Late yesterday afternoon a report
reached this city, in a cablegram from
a prominent Â¦ merchant ; in Honolulu,
that one of the interieland boats '{ that
had been plying between that place
and Kaul had seen a number 9/ Japan
ese warships hovering ? ln.the \ vicinity.
Whether they, were lying oft the harbor
of Honolulu and watching for-one;"of
the merchant marine steamships which
they believed - would "call" at Honolulu
on her way 'to the Orient or .were lying
in watch for the Lena was not made

close communication with the shore by
means of her wireless telegraphy sys
tem. She -kept Admiral "Goodrich
thoroughly advised as to ( her move
ments. Up to a late hour last night
she had not discovered ' .the alleged
fleet of Japanese . warships, that was
supposed to have been in close pursuit
of the Russian cruiser^ Lena.. Admiral
Goodrich, in speaking of the ,; Boston's
mission, said : ',*''Â¦ Â¦ : .
"I deemed it best, in the- Interest of

Regarding the conditions as serious,
Sargent will visit all of the southern
'stations and end his trip up along the
Canadian border. Mexico has been en
courajring Chinese immigration and
has thus increased the danger for the
Uniled States in that direction.
CALL BUREAU. HOTEL BARTON.
WASHINGTON. Sept. 15.â One purpose
of the inspection trip on which F. P.
Sargent, Commissioner of Immigration,
departed is to strengthen the Chinese
exclusion service along the Mexican
border. It is reported that hundreds
of Chinese have been entering Mexico
of late with the purpose of stealing
ecross the border into the United
States. The scene of action of the Chi
nese for frauds has lixgely changed
from Can&da to Mexico. Speaking of
this to-day, Sargent said:
"We are having more trouble along
the border in the south than ever be
fore and it probably will increase. In
stead of poing to work in the southern
and central parts of Mexico, for which
th^ir importation was intended, the
Chinese are congregating along the
American line, simply waiting for an
opportunity to get into this country.
"We are having the greatest trouble
in Lower California, however, and we
have increased our men there. The
peninsula Is thronged with Chinese and
these are making their way over the
hills and mountains Into Tia Juana
ar,d thence north to San Diego. It is
hard work locating the culprits In this
sort of territory."

report serious damage to growing crops
and fruits by the wind and rain. The
rainfall .during the prevalence of the
storm for seventeen hours was 5.0S
inches. '
In this city to-day William Norton
was killed by coming into contact with
a live wire blpv^n.,down: during the
storm.
The steamship Joppa, from Easton
to Baltimore, tried â¢ in vain to j make
landings on the bay shore. Her cargo
listed and for hours she pitched and
rolled with water dashing into her
cabins and drenching panic-stricken
passengers. She reached this city safe

VBALTIMORE,, Sept. 15.â Reports
from down the Chesapeake Bay indi
cate that last night's storm was un
precedented in its fury and long con
tinuance. For nearly ten hours last
night and early this morning the bay
was swept by a rain and wind storm
which evidently was more severe
farther down the bay than at its head.
The storm played havoc with ship
ing, in the northern part of the bay
particularly. The wharves at both
Betterton and Tolchester were par
tially washed aw.vy. while sail boats,
steam launches a\d all light craft
around Tolchester, Mlavre de Grace
and Betterton were badly damaged. In
many cases the boats were washed
away and lost.
By this time the government officials
had assumed full charge of the situa
tion, for not far ahead were the bis
ordnance yards, in which were thou
sands of tons of powerful explosives.
A party of sailors, together with a
company of Royal Engineers, landed
to the north of the flre and began blow
ing up buildings. For an hour the en
tire city was shaken by the terrific ex
plosions. More than a dozen buildings
were leveled, and at 7 o'clock the flre
had reached the cleared space, where
it stopped. â¢_'â¢- "
Crowds of people who had rushed
down Smith wharf found themselves
hemmed" In with the fire on one side
and the harbor on the other, and all
had to be taken off by launches from
the warships. By this time the entire
city had begun to realize the gravity
of the situation. At half- past 3 it
looked as if I nothing could stay the
progress of the flames from the main
business section pf the city and' into
the residential section beyond. Every
effort on the part of the firemen to stay
the flamea was futile, t
Then came the providential shift of
wind. ' * Â¦
There the fire raged on lower "Water
street practically beyond control until
7 o'clock to-night, when two hundnnl
sailors with torpedo apparatus landed
and with the assistance of two hun
derd troops checked, further progress
by removing, with the aid of dynamite,
a dozen v email buildings.
The fire. consumed six wharves, two
coal piers, two hotels, a dozen ware
houses and a number of. retail shops.
'During the fire a large tree fell, kill
ing Flora King. 28 years old, and
wounding two others. !>i-?iÂ»*^ L:. ;Â¦*Â¦_.Â¦Â¦
Admiral Sir Archibald Douglas per
sonally directed, the sailors in protect
ing Imperial property, and two hun
dred'marines patrolled the streets.
'. One. fireman, was" fatally injuredby a
live- wire," and another was badly hurt
by falling slate.
The burned district, which covered
about two acres, was one of wooden
buildings three and four stories high,
many of them built years ago, when
Halifax merchants dealt heavily in
fish.
Between 3 and 4 o'clock this after
noon,, when the fire was at its height
and a fearful southerly gale was push
ing It straight toward the heart of the
business center, consternation reigned
throughout the entire city. Shortly
after 4 o'clock, however, the wind
shifted and turned the flames along the
wharves and warehouses.
HALIFAX, N.,S.,*Sept. 15.â A for.
tunate shift of the wind saved Halifax
from destruction by fire to-day. Nev
ertheless the city suffered a loss, of a
half-million dollars in the business
part of the water front, and the prog
ress of the flames was stayed only by
the dynamiting of a dozen buildings by
the sailors from the fleet and soldiers
from the garrison.

PORTLAND, Sept 15.â A telephono
arrangement by which those speaking
may also see the face of the person at
the other end of the line has been in
vented by a Portland man. J. B. Fow
ler of 115 Russell street.
That the apparatus does what the
inventor claims for it Is best proved
by a visit, for as he has no patent
upon it as yet. scientific explanations
are lacking. Ever since 1378 Fowler
has been working upon a device by
which two persons at a distance mlsht
see one another's features.
Two months ago he hit upon the
idea, which, followed out. has resulted
in the apparatus exhibited by him to
day for the first time. * A newspaper
man made so thorough a'n investigation
of the apparatus this evening that fake
is impossible. How far it will be pos
sible to see faces over the wire must
yet be ascertained, for Fowler has kept
the entire line within his own resi
dence.
To the observer there appears an
apparatus much resembling\the front
end of a large camera. There is alao
a telephonic transmitter. To see over
the wire one. puts his eyes to the .tuba
which corresponds to the . lens of a
camera. Miss Lillian Fowler weni to
the other end'df the wire, twenty-five
feet away, In another room, and where
any reflecting by mirrors was out of
the question. Her face showed up as
distinct and clear as a miniature paint
ing. As she spoke her lips were seen
to move.
The observer was in darkness that
he might see the more clearly. Fowler
ha3 not yet doubled his apparatus so
that both persons may observe one an
other^ as they speak. He believes that
this- can easily be done. Apparently
electrical Incandescence plays a largo
part. *Â¦.'.*'

Pullman Car Works at Pullman were
shut down to-day and practically
every one of the company's 7000 em

told to take their tools with them
when they left the works and from
this they infer that a considerable
period of idleness confronts them.
The closing jf the big car works at
the "model city" came when the 1500
workers in the repair department were
laid off. That had been the only
branch of the plant in operation for
some time and its closing left not
more than 100 men at work, just
enough to put the finishing touches on
what Uttle work remained on hand
and to keep the many buildings in
condition.

OMAHA, Sept. 15.â A Japanese vil
lage has been established within the
precincts of the South Omaha packing
plants for the maintenance of sixty
subjects of the Mikado who came to
break the strike and whom the strikers
will not permit to live elsewhere. Last
evening the Japanese were Installed In
an improvised hostelry for their espe
cial benefit, but by nightfall they were
compelled to do a "Kuropatkin back
to the plant.
Strikers gathered at the Japanese ho
tel in mobs, with brands and kerosene,
with which they declared they would
burn the building and the Japanese in
it if they were. allowed to sleep there.
The Jananese retreat was under the
protection of a force of deputy sheriffs.
What to do with the Japanese has
been a problem for the plant managers
since the strike settlement. They are
too good workmen to be turned adrift
to make way for the old union men.
The strikers, many of whom are still
out of work, will not allow them to re
main unmolested outside the plants.
After the threat to burn the hotel the
plant's, superintendent bought stoves
and provisions and established the
Japanese inside the packing buildings.

DENVER, Colo., Sept. 15.â William
Jennings Bryan opened the Democrat
ic campaign in Colorado with a (speech
at Coliseum Hall to-night. By. far the
largest crowd assembled thus far dur
ing the campaign turned out to hear
the distinguished Nebraskan. Bryan
dwelt at length upon what he termed
the policy of militarism of the Repub
lican party, which was not influenced
alone by imperialism, but that the
strengthening of the army was as much
for the purpose of capital enforcing Its
demand on labor as anything else.- He
characterized President Roosevelt as
a dangerous man because of his love
of power and warlike demonstration,
and unsuitable to be at the head of
a nation that wanted to be great in
moral force and not physical force.
"You ask me, a believer in free sil
ver, how I can bring myself to support
a man who favors the gold standard.
I say that I love peace and the gos
pel of peace Infinitely more than I love
either gold or silver."
Bryan assured his hearer* that if
Parker were elected President peace
would reign in the United States dur

We inaugurated the manufacture of beet
sugar, which has 'now become a prominent'in

must naturally come our way and there are
evidences that this overflow is Increasing the
adTantages and resources of the region.
It would be difficult to select an equal area

factures â are In a line state of development,
but capable of much future expansion.
Thin area embraces all grades of climate
and there Is hardly a product. of the' soil in
any zone but what finds hospitality within our
borders. We are the producers of all kinds
of grain and fruit In abundance. We can
supply the whole country with all the raisins
and wine It can consume. If we Include
Hawaii, we have cane pugar plantations under
the most Intelligent cultivation of any in the
world and capable of furnishing 400,000 tons
per annum.
The West abounds in everything except peo
ple. This deficit is causing no anxiety. The
population is increasing more rapidly than
in the remainder- of the country. There was
a gain of nearly 31 per cent In the nine States
and Territories known as the West between
l%90 and lfOO, against a gain of a little over
20 per cent In the remainder of the country.
There are no available figures of gain since
1900, but there are "good reasons for believing
that the Increase for the past four years has
been proportionately greater than It was In
the previous ten. "

Prussing of Chicago, whose topic was
"National Banks and the Trust Com
pany Problem."
A feature of the day was the "call
of sections â north, south, east and
west," which brought forth five min
ute statements by bankers on the en
couraging condition of business in the
various parts of the country from
which they came. Robinson spoke in
part as follows:
The "Western banker is practically the prod
uct of the last decade. Until that time " the
West and the Western product were not con
sidered of much importance. Indeed, I well re
member when a man from the West, especial
ly the Western banker, was looked upon not
only with suspicion, but with absolute dis
trust. The West was considered for many
years the birthplace of the wildest vagaries,
prominent among which wan Populism. Free
silverâ 10 to 1â if It had not Its origin In
the West, found there Its strongest and most
brilliant advocate, the Hon. William Jennings
Bryan, a born master of men.
While Populism and free silver are con
sidered among the Western inconnUtencieo,
they were not without good results. . They
both served as educators or renovators. They
were a* pebbles thrown In the business ocean,'
etartlnc the waves of agitation. From tfils
agitation the public mind was awakened, the
pitfalls were cleaned up, Niagara was seen
ahead In time to avert a calamity and to-day
the West stands as Gibraltar.

"If the ablest Democratic orator, can
find only these two points of attack
in the record and letter of Mr. Roose
velt surely they have no case against
him."
"In the one case," said Senator De
pew, "the President reduced by three
years the disability age limit, fixed at
65 years by President Cleveland; in the
other he secured a Panama canal
â¢ When Senator Depew took the plat
form to nominate for Secretary of
6tate John F. O'Brien he took occasion
to reply to the speech of Congressman
"W. Bourke Cockran last night at Tam
thany Hall, and devoted Rome minutes
to its arguments. He declared that Mr.
Cockran would undoubtedly be the At
torney General" of the United States in
the event of Judse Parker's election.
He said he had heard Mr. Cockran.
tvhom he characterized as the great
est orator of the Democratic party on
rhe floor, defend free trade and de
nounce protection of every name and
nature. He said Mr. Cockran evidently
had been able to find in President
Roosevelt's actions and letter of ac
reptanee but two points to sustain
the charge of unconstitutional action
made agaJnst him by the Democrats.
One was his pension orcer. making age
above 62 years in itself a disability,
the other his action in connection with
the Panama canal treaty.

There wa* no slight anywhere in the
proecednps to Senator Platt, save in
i^fusal of the convention to accede to
his declared wish for the nomination
of Woodruff. L*very mention of his
name was enthusiastically cheered
nsain and again, the whole convention
arising with deafening shouts and ap
plause to do him honor.
Governor Odell, too, as Governor and
as chairman of the State Committee,
was cheered at every turn.
" Following is a synopsis of the plat
form :
The Republicans of the Empire State, the
home of Theodore Roosevelt, in convention
aissfrr.bied. congratulate the country on the
â¢pleatfid results of the recent elections in Ore
cn. Vermont asd Maine and the ineplration
they have Riven to the cause of Ilootevelt and
Katetmaks.
In the convention the Woodruff fac
tion was exi eedingly enthusiastic and
insistent. Iiut the Â«>nly thing approach
ing a Fhowlng of strength was when
his> name was first placed in nomina
tion. The great majority of the con
vention 6at tilen*. through the demon
stration.
"There is no change in the situation.
My name will be presented to the con
vention."
Immediately after Woodruff had
left Platt. Odcll called upon the
Senator. Later bo said his call was
eimply friendly and that he under
stood Woodruff would go into the con
tention and eft as many votes as he
could.
>A protracted conference was held
Â«"arly in the day between Senator Platt
and Woodruff and his immediate coun
selors, in the Platt quarters. At its
dope Fenator Platt refused to be in
terviewed and Woodruff said:
SARATOGA, N. T., Sept. 15.â The
Republican State Convention adjourned
at 2:30 o'clock to-day after nominating
unanimously the ticket for State offi
cers forecasted last night In these diÂ«
patches as follows:

Chief Judge of the Court of Appealsâ
ildgar M. Cullen (Democrat).
Associate Judge of the Court of Ap
pealsâWilliam E. Werner.
The unanimous action of the conven
tion in the nomination of Higgins was
made possible by the withdrawal of
former Lieutenant Governor Timothy
L. Woodruff at the very last moment,
as the convention was preparing for
the roll call demanded by the resolu
tion of the Kings County delegation.
It was only, as he said, "because it be
came obvious to his practiced ear" that
the convention was almost solidly
against him. after his name had been
placed in nomination in a epeech by
William A. Prendergast of Brooklyn,
In which the management of the Hig
gins campaign was bitterly attacked,
that Woodruff took the platform, with
drew his name from further considera
tion, moved that the nomination of
Lieutenant Governor Higgins be made
unanimous and pledged the fullest ef
fort of himself and his Kings County
forces in aid of the ticket about to be
nominated. There was no contest what
ever over any other place upon the
ticket.

LONDON. Sept. 16. â The Daily
Mail's correspondent at Mukden, tele
graphing under date of September 12,
draws a distressing: picture of the sad
condition of Chinese refugees, who
are fleeing from their homes and
crowding into Mukden. The whole
fertile plain around Liaoyan? has
been depopulated and numerous vil
lages have been burned by the explo
sion of shells.
While they are thus expelled from
their homes and deprived of the prof
its of harvest, the natives can obtain
no compensation in the form of extra
work or business arising â¢froni the
war, because the profit from the sale
of provisions, etc., to the qombatants
has been mostly secured by clever
contractors or rascally interpreters.
Numerous Villages Destroyed by the

Restrictions Are Closer on Deer Hunt

Is Reduced.
SAXTA ROSA. Sept- 15. â The
Board of Supervisors have adopted a
new ordinance, effective October 1, re
garding game. The open season for
deer is changed from July 15 and Sep
tcmixrr 1 to Auffust 1 and October 1,
making it a month later in closing
and two weeks longer than formerly.
The bag limit of birds is cut down
from fifty to twenty-five per day. to
cause market hunters to cease their
depredations.
The former game ordinance was de
clared invalid by Judge Prewett of
Placer Countr because it discriminat
ed in favor of Soncma County resi
dents. It provided that came killed
in Sonoma County could not be sold
outside the county, but it could be dis
posed of within the county. This was
held to be a discrimination.
The article concludes with the state

there has been no practical result of
the great battles and that there wilt
be another as great or greater. The
paper admonishes the Russian people
to wait with- patience for the inevit
able Russian triumph.

"The world is just beginning to re

real result was shown by the immedi

Captain Donvig asserts that tests
have proved the absolute safety of
those who have trusted themselves to
the globe. Any number up to sixteen
persons have only to climb into the
globe, close the manholes and, without
fear, wait for their vessel to sink. No
matter how great th"e suction, he says,
the globe will bob up serenely and
right side up. and thereafter It will be
merely a question of waiting for an
other vessel to come along and pick
them up.
One globe brought to America by
Captain Donvlg arrived on the Touralne
last Saturday and was unloaded to-day.
Captain Donvig's globe Is large
enough to hold sixteen persons, and Is
provisioned and watered to supply this
number of passengers for one month.
It is so designed that there appears to
those who have seen It no reason why
It should not be able to keep afloat for
an indefinite time.
NEW YORK, Sept. .15.â "Suppose a
ship on which you are a passenger is
sunk by another vessel. All you would
have to do would be to jump into the
life-saving globe, and even if you were
adrift a month you would be able to
say truthfully that your voyage had
merely been pleasantly prolonged."
Captain J. 21. Donvlg, inventor of the
globe life-saver, who thus expressed his
confidence In it. will explain his devlcÂ©
to the Navy Department in Washing

disappeared in the Russian army now

The failure of the Japanese to ; fol
low up the advantage gained at Liao
yang has caused surprise Tiere. An in
dependent authority, who accompanied
the rear guard from the positions south
of Liaoyang to Mukden, says that this
failure Is accounted for by the fac.t
that the Japanese lost 40,000 klllsd and
wounded in one day's fighting and that
they were too tired to continue the
advance.
The Japanese are reported to be In

"A dispatch from Yakutsk, Eastern

Kommander Islands, off the coast of
-Kamchatka, has been besieged by Jap
anese and British schooners and steam
ships up _to July 28. Two of these
schooners and the steamships were
armed with guns. In driving them off
ten Japanese were killed and many
wounded. We sustained no loss.
"Near Kamchatka five Japanese fish
ing schooners have been burned. Their
crews were annihilated. ,
"The Japanese announced the annex

It a Japanese protectorate. They were
subsequently captured Dy 120 Russian

"Kamchatka remains true to her old
traditions. The inhabitants have taken
up arms and are ready to shed their
blood for their faith, their Czar and
their fatherland."
The Kommander Islands are the Is
lands for whose protection against
these very expeditions , arrangements
were made by Russia with Great Brit

An official report has also been re

uniforms are taboo and that a hardship will
not only be worked on ' students who cannot
afford to lay out $17 for a new uniform but
also upon those who have already purchased
the used clothes. That Is why a bis protest is
under way. ,Â¦

.But, while I am now : on . the ' borders of

tion 1 may feel is temjiered with the regret of
a writer and a Californianâ the first that It
was made throuRh sources other than my pen,
and the second that It was made In the oil
of trade from a level plain Instead of through
the gold of my beloved California hills.
It is not often that ' a poet , steps from the
most ordinary of circumstances to wealth, and
I am wondering what I wJU do with bo much
money. I shall use it for my fellow-man, and
for my friends : who occasionally come to me
at my llttlo place on the tops of the Oakland
hills.
I . have been * informed that oil has been
found In and around the land that I have held
in Texas for eo many- years . and I am sup
posed toj>e worth a treat deal of money. At
If it st this is what they, tell me from the place
where- the' land is located. There are Texas
gusher.i all around there and a Texas gusher,
I -believe, spouts wealth In the' shape of the
oil of commerce. , ' Â¦ v
Now the poet is wondering what he
will do with his newly acquired wealth
and he is lamenting that his fortune
came through sources other than his
beloved pen.
This is the information that reached
Mr. Miller within the last few days at
his home at. "The Heights," back of
Oakland. Many years ago Mr. Miller
secured some land In Texas. It, pro
duced little and aside from the annual
demands from the tax collector Mr.
Miller heard little from it. But now
comes the story that'oil has been struck
in. and around the land and the poet is
figuring on a trip to Texas to see what
he has and Just how much he Is worth.

Claudius ts a drummer for the Crown
Distillery Company in San Francisco
and a year apo was granted a divorce
from Genise Claudius on the ground of
desertion.
There Is now a' ruling both ways upon
the same point in this county and the
Interest of the legal fraternity gener
ally, is aroused. A year ago Judges
Melvin aod- Greene held that the pres
ent divorce law is unconstitutional.
This was in accordance with the views
of Judge Rhodes of San Jose and other
well known Jurists of this State. Then
Â«ame a dccisiun of the Supreme Court
upholding the law. These Judges, hold
ing the law to be unconstitutional, had
granted final decrees as thougti the
present law was not upon the statutes.
In some instances, after the Supreme
Court decision had been rendered, law
yers immediately had the final decrees
set aside and interlocutory decrees
planted in their stead and then let
their clients wait out the year. But
v/here this was neglected until the year
vas up, by one decision the year was
lost and another must now elapse. By
the decision of Judge .Melvin, however,
there is yet hope that tne year's wait
may be saved.
An opposite view was taken of this
same point by Judge Greene a short
time ago, when he held that a final
decree granted by him was void, and
he took the view that he could not
substitute Â«.n interlocutory in its stead.
He stated" that the fact had been de
termined that one party w'as entitled
to a divorce, but that a wrong Judg
ment had been entered according to
the law, as it now stands, which pro
vides that a year must elapse between
the granting of an interlocutory and
a final decree and that all the relief he
could give would be to grant an inter
locutory decree "and let the party wait
out the twelve months for the final
decree.
According to a decision rendered by
Judge Melvln to-day a final; decree of
divorce granted by him a -year ago
In the case of P. Claudius against Ge
eine Claudius works the Bame as if
it had been an interlocutory decree and
he allowed Attorney Asa V. Â¦Menden
hall to substitute an interlocutory de
cree as of that date in its stead. By
this ruling Claudius is saved waiting
a year for his final decree. The, ap
plication for a final decree, which
Â¦would naturally follow an interlocu
tory decree after a year!s wait, how
c-ver, was not allowed by Judge Mel
vin And the matter is to be argued be
fere the Superior Judges sitting in
bank.

What was enough for our grandparents

ALAMEDA, Sept. 15.â Owing to the
opposition ! that has developed to the
demand made by the Board of Educa
tion upon the City Trustees that the
public schools be allowed an apportion
ment of $43,179 out of the next tax levy,
the directors of the department and the
Superintendent of Public Schools' have
inaugurated a campaign to enlighten
residents with respect to the needs of
the schools. To-night. Superintendent of
iSchools Fred T. Moore addressed the

upon "Alameda's School Facilities." He
said in part: â¢
Our school census In the spring of this year
ehowed a population of 19.048 and the number
of census children between 5 and 17 years of
age to be 4073. Of this number 353Â« were en
rolled In the public schools and the average
number taught through the year was 2005.4.
This is a very large' percentage of children
actually In school, compared with other cities
of our class. This is due largely, to the fact
that there are few children here employed in
manual labor.

For the committee on platform and

following report, which was unani
mously adopted:
The Union Labor party of the City and
County of San Francisco, in convention as
seinbled. makes the following declaration of
the principles and policies upon which its ask*
the suffrage of the people for Its candidates at
the coming election:
I.
We declare that the Union' Labor party Is
not a class party and does not Intend to es
tablish a class government. It is true that on
account of peculiar exigencies of the political
situation It originated through the active ef
fort* of & portion of our people, but it em
braces and seeks to comprehend In Its mem
bership all elements of our population, lrre
Â«i>ectlve of class, creed or station. It is es
sentially the party of the plain peopleâ the
party of those who are benefited by co
operation for the protection and maintenance
of their political rights. And, while it re
epects and protects the rights of all. It is at
the came time designed to secure effectively
for the wage earner, for the small taxpayer, for i
the larger mass of our citizenship, the rights i
and privileges to which under the law they
are legitimately entitled, and which hereto
fore have only too frequently been enjoyed by
the few.
II.
It stands for the peaceful advancement ot
the masses and for the betterment of their ma- â¢
tertal. social and political conditions and looks 1
forward to fair and equal consideration and '
protection of capital and labor, employer and
employe alike.
Its motto is "Equal rights to all anJ special
privileges tÂ» none."
We indorse and commend the administration
of our honored standard bearer. Eugene E.
Schmitz, Mayor of San Francisco, for Its
ability. Integrity and conservatism and for its
achieved result, doing equal Justice to all.
We deprecate the malicious and malignant
assaults of that portion oL the press of San
Francisco which is subsidised, venal and cor
rupt and which has undertaken by downright
and shameful falsehood and calumny to cast
aspersion upon a. brave and honest man striv
ing against powerful Influences to do his
whole duty toward the people who elected him.
III.
We call the attention of the people of Ean
Francisco to the corrupt combination of cer
tain political Interests of the city with pur
chased and venal newspapers, as part uf a
conspiracy to defraud and defeat the will
of tfce people at the next municipal election
and also the attacks InrplrÂ«d by the . failure
of certain Journalistic proprietors to secure for
their relatives Important appointments de
manded from the present administration, which
up to that time they had praised and lauded.
IV.
We condemn the course of the majority of
the Board of Supervisors, under the leader
ship of Supervisors Brandenstein, Braunhart
and D'Ancona, to make future petty political
capital for themselves by failing to make suf
ficient and necessary appropriation to conduct
the business cf the various municipal de
r&rUnents. thereby discreditably attempting to
crirrle their operation and to Impair their
efficiency.
We pledc* our candidates for the office of
Superior Judge to a strict and Impartial In
terpretation of the laws without fear, or favor
and without regard to class, condition, race or
creed.
We pledge our candidates for the State Leg
islature to deal Justly and . fairly â¢ with every
Interest which may be embraced, in any legis
lation coming before them.
We favor the abolition of the poll tax as
beiig a harsh, unjust' and Inequitable tax
We pledge our nominees for the Legislature
to favor, such chances In the - school laws of
the State of California as . will . prevent the
teaching of white and mongollan- children la
the same schoolrooms cf our schools.
Â¦ We demand that the suppa^s to public In
stitutions of the State shall be the product of
union labor, and t rat roods; of, home manu
facture shall b* Riven prcfeience.
- We are oppesed to the extension of the use
of the writ ot injunction 'on all conceivable oc
casions, at the petition of . wealth and . capital,
axalnst the laboring element of our people, and
weresret the result of apparently: unequal in
fiuences on the mind* of some of the tribunals
I which have been call ed' upon U> pass upon the
Issuance of such writs. : ~'Z"'

All day yesterday Union Labor men
vtre told "that Wynn fought E. E.
Bcfamltz for Mayor in the municipal
ian-.pa!?n of 1&03 and cast the weight
of hÂ«*= influence in favor of Franklin
K La^e. Last night the Schmitz fol
lowers at Pioneer Hall retaliated by
lui-nins down Wynn. Santa Clara and
fcin Mateo counties were favorable to
an indorsement of Wynn. but they
vere outvoted, outgeneraled and out
classed by ihe forces of organized la
bor of this city.
Early yesterday morning word was
passed along the political line that the
Labor party has been programmed by
IL-jef. Schmitz. Lynch. Hearst and Her
1 i'i to indorse E. J. Livernash for Con
gress in the Fourth. It was asserted
that Hearst had made a personal re-
Ciucst for the indorsement of both Liv
errsash and Wynn, but that the Re
publican delegates in the labor ranks
\vÂ«.uld not stand for the Indorsement of
t wo nominees of the t>emocratic party.
Mureover. it was stated that the sup
porters of organized labor could not be
coerced or cajoled into a declaration
In favor of Wynn's candidacy, in view
or the latter** open support of the
Democratic nominee for Mayor in U03.
Politicians of all parties regard it as
rather remarkable that Herrin. Hearst,
Ruef. Schmitz and Lynch should meet
on common ground and fix up a flate
for the Union Labor party, but all the
Fijms point to a labor indorsement of
Livernash. A story is current that Liv
ernash will not accept the labor nom
ination unless the delegates agree to
fcis terms and conditions. It is said
that he demands the indorsement of
Wynn. There is a possibility that the
labor leaders will not submit to any
dictation from Livernash In order to
meet the wishes of Herrin. Ruef and
Schmitz. In fact. Ruef and Schmitz are
rot highly pleased over Livernashs
candidacy. The Republicans it is said
can win the district no matter what
position the Union Labor convention
takes with reference to Livernash. The
programme as arranged early this week
provided that the Labor convention
should meet Thursday night and nom
inate Livernash. but so much time was
taken up last night in organizing the
main convention and adjusting affairs
in the Fifth District that the midnight
hour was striking before the way was
clear for the Fourth District delegates
to meet. .
There are .three regular candidates
for Congress *in the Fifth District. The
UtiSon Labor party convention at Pw
r.ecr Hall last night refused to indorse
the Democratic nomination of- W. J.
}?yna and placed in the fieid as the
jk mince of that party Charles J. Wll
hams, member of the San Francisco
Civil Service Commission.

VERDICT MEETS
WITH CRITICISM
WYNN IS TURNED DOWN
BY UNION LABOR PARTY
THE SAM FRANCISCO CALL', FRIDAY. SEPTEMBER 16. 1904.
George T. . Querbach, alias "Pistol i
Jack," who was tried for murder and!
convicted of manslaughter by a jury in
Judge Cook's court, was sentenced yes- ;
terday to serve ten years in San Quen- j
tin. . I
In view of the Jury's verdict this :
sentence was the longest the court ;
cculd impose, but in sentencing Quer-j
bach Judge Cook took occasion to scorÂ»
the jury.
The Judge said that he did not agree
with the verdict of the jury. The de
fendant should either have been con-
vlcted of murder in the first degree or
acquitted. It seemed strange -to him
the fact was not commented upon at
the trial that from the condition of the
body of the murdered woman an at
tempt had been made to criminally as
sault her. There was evidence of a des
perate struggle, the woman's clothes ,
having been torn off her body. If death j
resulted from the struggle to protect J
her honor the defendant was guilty of
homicide. The Jury had, however,
brought in a verdict of manslaughter,
and he could only give the defendant
the extreme penalty.
Querbach had been engaged to be
married to Mrs. Annie Wilson, a widow,
who lived at" 6 Capp street. He had
bought her* a wedding dress, bonnet
and other articles, but they quarreled
and he left her house. He returned, as
he said, to get some of hi3 clothes on
Sunday, November 1, and availed him
self of the opportunity to destroy the
wedding dress and other articles he
had given her. A struggle ensued, and
a few hours later Mrs. Wilson was
found dead in the house.
Mrs. Wilson, although a powerfully
built woman, was a sufferer from fatty
degeneration of the heart, and it was
argued for the defense that death was
due to that cause superinduced by the
shock of the struggle with the defend
ant. Querbach wrote a letter to Cap
tain Martin â¢ under an assumed name
admitting that he had murdered Mrs.
Wilson, but that he had no intention of
doing so, as she was the only woman
he had ever loved.

APVEHTISE-MENTS.
"When a person has been told that
they are In tbe last stages of consump-
tion, and that no treatment can help
them, it is surely a wonderful relief,
both physically and mentally, to find a
treatment that has curative effects. My
condition was a very serious one. and all
the medical treatment that I used did
m<? no good. I heard of the success of
Electro-Chemistry in serious diseases
like tny own and I went to the Electro-
Chemic Institute. No. 118 Grant ave., for
a careful examination. This examination
was free, and it was so thorough that I
had great hopes when the Klectro-
Chemlc specialists tojd me that Electro-
chemistry would cure me. I began the
treatment Immediately, and in a short
time my condition was greatly Improved
in every way. When I first went to the
Institute my breathing: was so short that
I could hardly Â»^> up the stairs. I had a
very serious cough and I expectorated
horrible looking matter from my lÂ«ngii.
I had fever In the afternoons and had
night sweats. I had lost a great deal of
flesh and was eo weak that I could
scarcely get about. I feel like a new wo-
man now. J feel stronger In every. way.
The cough has disappeared. The. night
sweats ar.d the afternoon fevers have
disappeared. I do not expectorate bad
looking matter from my lungs, and all
of this has been, accomplished in a very
*hort time and at very little expense. I
feel it my duty to tell other sufferers of
the wonderful effects of Electro-Chemis-
try in bad cases like my own. My name
is Mr?. M. .Macdougall and I live at Xo.

BROWNIES FALL IN TWELFTH.
PORTLAND, SeDt- 15. â After mak
ne three runs to Tacoma's two In, the
Joe Long and George Sullivan, the
two well-known heavy-weight boxers,
will furnish the main event of the San
Francisco Club's show to-night at
Woodward's Pavilion. Dick Hyland
and Frank Walsh are signed for: the
special .event. There will be five other
bouts .between likely youngsters. Alex
Greggains will referee.
Fast Amateur Boxers to 3feet-
Billy Pierce wants the fight to be
on the square. He says it will be if he
has this way. . "I want the newspaper
men to name the referee," says Pierce.
"Any good, honest man will suit me.
If he . sees any sign of fake let him
stop the battle and the patrons will
get their money back. Walcott never
felt better in his life than he does
right nov.-. I think the public of San
Francisco will see the greatest mill In
years when the two black wonders
come together."
Joe Walcott arrived in town last
night, accompanied by his manager,
Billy Pierce of Boston. The "Barba
does Wonder** says he will beat Gan.i
Â¦when they mix It on the last day ot
the month. The dark, lad looks in
good form and says he will have no
trouble in making the weight.' He will
begin training to-morrow in Oakland
and will probably be assisted by Jack
Johnson, the colored heavy-weight
champion.
Welter-Weight Champion Will Train
at Oakland and Will Probably
Be Assisted by Johnson.

CHICAGO. Sept. 15. â It is reported
that Ralph Rose, the California
giant, declared to-day that the aim.
object and intent of every form of
athletics he has taken up Is with a
view to the boxing championship. 'and
that some day *e hopes to earn the
title, either by beating Jeffries or by
conquering the man who may conquer
Jeffries or who may succeed to hi3
title.
The frank statement of Rose that
his course in college is only to fit him
for the prize ring has startled not only
the Ann Arbor faculty, but has
aroused a storm of protest and con-
i demnation in the universities and col
leges of the United States. Here are
the comparative measurements of
Rose and Jeffries:

The Angels went after their runs in a
systematic ciir.tr y^terday at Rec
reation Park. They got then all in
tÂ»unch*s of threes, and would not ac
cept any that did not come that way.
Then th*y would lapse into retirement
for three rounds. &c<i start in to pile
cp three more. The Commuter* never
got busy, and the gaise ended & to L
Mr. Buchanan got Â«;uite a wallopingâ
in fact, cue of the best that he haa
yet b**n handed in this league. But
the walloping was not his downfall.
Dummy playing had much to do with
it. and as he contributed a couple of
the** plays hirrj-elf te is cne of the re
sponsible parties.
Bernard opened up the battle with a
drive over nr*t that took, a mean bound
aÂ»ay from Streib and went for two
bag?. Then Sehlafiey erred on Flood's
bunt. Smith shoved one over Buchan
an's head that a lively young roan
wouSd have made into a double play.
Cravath alM tried the bunting game.
acd th.i5 time Sch!af!ey fell down ence
tnor*. after which Chase pulled off a
tingle and the three runs were assured.
Nothing more happened to stir the
facs mi the Angels began to wade in
again during the fifth. A couple of hits
end a cocple of dummy plays made a
full hwÂ». In the meantime two were
gorse. Tfce fans were rea^y to bet that
Buchanan wc-Id escape unscathed
when Row collided with a fast one and
ehot it out to right for a triple, clearing
eff every bag. That made it six.
Just as a reminder that they were
rtOl in the goine the Angels started to
<io seme heavy work in the ninth. This
time three, straight wallops sent the
last trio past the final jump. These
were legitimate runs with the excep
tion of the first, and were about the
cn'y ones that could be called such.
Gray, though wild at times, was a
puzzle that the Commuters never had
& chance to solve. The best they got
Â«Â£E a pzir of singles, and one of these
was a scratch. Gray contributed the
ccly Oakland run with a couple of
h*a*s on balls and a misplay at the
first bag In trying to take a throw from
Ct:a.se after two were down in the sec
end. The score:

BRIGHTON BEACH, Sept. 15. â A
first-class vehicle of speculation was
afforded by the Mercury handicap to
day, so cleverly had the weights been
assigned- Top weight, 127 pounds,
was on Lady Amelia, whose remark
ably clever victory over this track a?
the July meeting made many fancy
her chances to-day, despite her
weight. King Pepper, at 20 to 1, beat
the barrier, but gave way to Lady
Amelia on the back stretch- The
Thomas mare led thereafter until tne
last hundred yards, when her stride
shortened palpably, and King Pepper
and Mineola fonght it out. the first
named winning by a head.
Africander, winner of the Brighton
Preliminary, was unlucky to-day In
the mile and a quarter handicap. His
principal opponent. Spring, was off
running, while his three opponents
were sJow to begin. After six furlongs
had been covered O'Neill, on Afri
cander, in alarm at the lead still re
tained by Spring began to urge his
n-.cur.t. This had a good effect, as tne
gap- of daylight was gradually reduced
by him, but not enough to win. Spring
Lasted long enough to win by a lengtn
and a half. He was all out and lucky
to get home first. It was Hildebrand's
first winning mount of the meeting.*

."The Wizard of Oz" has taken
America, by storm. The opening illu
s'on. showing the transition from
earth to fairyland, provides a foretaste
of the succession of wonders that fol
low. Perhaps. 'the most marvelous
work of stagecraft In the production
is thr- transformation at the end of
the . first act, where a field of poppy
flowers in full bloom is meta
morphosed from summer to winter.
The stage Is daflc at first and then
rr.in falls gently and" through the rain
oue discerns a field of gorgeous poppy
flowers of gigantic size. The rain
ceases, the sun rises," a golden glow
fills the atmosphere and emphasizes
th.e scarlet of the flowers, which are
discovered to be young and graceful
women. But scenery and pretty girls
are merely Incidentals of the extrava
ganzji.' It is the hearty, wholesome
fun of "The Wizard of Oz" which de-
Itght3 the audience and sends people
away from the theater in a glow of
good humor andt enthusiasm. The
Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman are
uproariously funny and keep the ball
of fun rolling all the. time they are on
the stage. The comical Lion and the
skittish Heifer, graphically .imperson
ated Y.y adepts in silent fun, are amus
ing not only to children but to grown
ups as well. Owing to the extreme
length of the performance and the
number of encores that all of the
pongs reap nightly the management
announces that the - curtain will rise
punctually at 8 o'clock. The opening
scene, showing the Kansas cyclone, Â»s
an exceptionally clever illusion, and
patrons are requested to come early
and w.'tness this realistic presentment
of the cyclone. Commencing Monday,
September 19, an engagement of two
weeks, with Sundays included, will
be played at the Columbia Theater.

Mrs. Mary . A. Jackson-Van Horn
gave way to tears in Judge Kerrigan's
court yesterday afternoon j when the
court handed down a decree annul
ling' her marriage to John H. Van
Horn, whom she married in
mento in 1S99. An unusual stpry lies
behind the proceedings.
When the Van Horns were married
Van I Horn confided to the woman
that was separated from him yester
day that he had been married before
and was undivorced. He had not seen
his . first wife for seven years, how
ever, and all efforfe to trace her had
failed. He believed she was dead. He
dtd not believe it necessary to take
the precaution of procuring'a divorce
from the woman he first married.
But recently his first wife, Mrs.
Eloise Van Horn, appeared. / There
was nothing left for the second Mrs.
Van Horn but to procure an annull
ment of her marriage. The story was
told to Judge Kerrigan yesterday and
he granted the petitioner's prayer.
When Mrs. Van Horn gave way to
her emotions the man she had looked
upon so many years as her husband
went to her side and comforted her
with the promise that all would yet
be well. The significance of his prom
ise is found in a divorce suit now
pending in Judge Seawell's court, in
which Mrs. Eloise Van Horn is de
fendant.
Cordelia E. Montgomery, known in
the histrionic world as Claudia Rog
ers, failed in her effort yesterday
morning before Judge Kerrigan to se
cure an annullment of herrnarriage
to Robert C. Montgomery. The court
took the case under advisement af
ter Intimating that the evidence sub
mitted was not sufficient to warrant
the issuance of a judgment as prayed.
Mrs. Montgomery stated that she
married her husband in Oakland in
1901 when she was but three months
over 15 years of age. After the cere
mony, she said, she returned to her
mother's hdme in the city, where she
has since lived. The question in
volved, is the right of the court to an
nul the marriage in the face of a
statute to the effect that marriage can
be consummated where the husband
is over 18 and the wife 15 years of
age. :'. : ;'.;. '. Â¦>:
It is understood that the Grand
Jury is co-operating with the Mer
chants' Association, which instigated
the arrest of Charles Wyman on
Wednesday and promises to institute
several uiore prosecutions in the im
mediate future. Registrar Adams has
refused to allow photographs to be
t^ken of the roslers in his possession
and as these are very important as
evidence it is believed that the step
t&ken by the Grand Jury yesterday
was to have the records preserved in
some manner, so they can be used in
the courts when the cases of the Mer
chants' Association come up for trial.
The Jury was in regular session yes
terday afternoon and sect a subpena
for the Registrar, but he was not in
his office. None of his deputies had
a key to the storeroom in which the
rosters are kept and adjournment
was therefore taken to this afternoon
at 3 o'clock, with instructions to the
balliX to hunt up Adams in the mean
time and serve the subpena on him.
The Merchants' Association regards
the Registrar in the light of purpose
ly thwarting thfir efforts, but Adams
explains that he feels it beyond his
authority to permit photographing of
the records. He insists that an order
shall first be obtained trom the Board
of Election Commissioners, who are
in control of the oflice and of which
he Is only the secretary.
SEEK GRAXD JURY'S AID.
It was decided by the prosecutors to
seek the offices of the Grand Jury, be
fore whose drastic iÂ»ower It is expected
Adams will yield up the rosters. Just
what it will do with the recordsâ
whether it will have them photo
graphed or notâ is not known, for its
members are yet to determine this
point-
It is by no means certain that a ma
jority of the grand Jurors will sanction
the making of photographic copies
while the records are in their posses
sion. No objection was offered yester
day to the issuance of a eubpena. for
the Registrar, but it is said that pro
tÂ«-5t against the photographs might
arise from those who are not
di?pop*d to act the part of assisting an
outside organization in a movement
that falls more properly within the
wope of the Grand Jury Itself. Again,
some of the Merchants' Association
repreaenSAtfTea do not hesitate to de
clare that there are some members of
the Grand Jury who are more eager to
apply a roat of whitewash than do any
ihing else in connection with the oper
ations of the gangs of ballot-box Etuf
fers.
ItOSTERS TELLÂ« OF FORGERIES.
The evidence to be furnished is very
important, in that the rosters contain
the forgeries of names of bona fide resi
dent citizens whose names were voted
while they were yet at their breakfast
tables by the Bluffers, who began as
soon as the polls opened to proceed
from precinct to precinct in carrying
on their criminal work. The drug
fir-nds, who for the most part consti
tuted the gangs-of Bluffers, proved very
awkward with .the pen, and in compari
son with the genuine signatures of citi
zens the proof of forgery is easily es
tablished.
The Merchants' Association declares
that if it can be assured of the produc
tion of the rosters in court, or photo
graphic copies of them, it will at once
proceed with the arrest of many of the
m*>n who participated in the frauds,
pome of them men of high station, of
ficially and otherwise. The fear is ex
pressed that the records will be de-
Btroyed. however, for the law makes
d^truction of records the duty of the
Registrar as soon as the conventions
are over for which delegates were elect
ed at the primaries. The resort to the
photographic method of preserving evi
dence having failed thus far. the only
hope of the prosecutors to go into court
with thejr cases in the shape they
would desire them to be lies with the
Grand Jury. *
Itself in regard to the frauds at, the

Despite her rough experience with the
elements, that were so unkind to hÂ«T
except at the Horn, the captain of the
British Isles thinks that his trip was
what might be called "fine."
Sailing northward on this side of the
continent, when in almost the same
latitude where she had trouble in the
Atlantic, the British Isles ran into a
fierce pale from southeast to southwest.
The seas bearded the ship, flooding the
cabin and deckhouses and washing
overboard everything movable. The
first mate and three men of the crew,
who were on the topgallant forecastle
overhauling and securing the anchor
lashings, were washed aft and rendered
helpless by being dashed against the
mainmast and bulwarks. They had a
narrow escape from being washed over
board. It was some time before they
recovered sufficiently to resume their
posts of duty. ..; (â¢ ',',"
The English ship British Isles, which
came In yesterday. 123 days from
Antwerp, had a novel experience with
the storms and calms of the seas she
traversed. She labored with heavy
gales in the English Channel, fought
her way through the tempests of the
Atlantic, had her decks swept with
water in the stormy Pacific, and oft the
Horn, where winds and waves are ever
at war, she sailed with all her canvas
spread alow and alort. With five com
panion ships the British Islss came
around the cape like a summer regatta
of yachts.
According to Captain Parker's los
soon after leaving Antwerp the British
Isles ran into a head sale in the Eng
lish Channei. which he bucked for six
days. "U'ith every* piece of canvas furled
or reeled close * down sh<> worried
through it and got into the Atlantic
with all her spars and sails aboard. In
latitude 32 degrees south she struck a
heavy southwest gale with high cross

THE whole State is gratified by the escape of the Big Basin from
the disastrous fire thatiraged in the Santa Cruz Mountains. In
that tract is the California Redwood Park, the property of the
State, and the finest primitive forest in the Coast Range. It had just
been brought into general notice by the excursion of the State Board
of Trade and had attracted the enthusiasm of- all lovers of the
forest.
, The fire invaded it, cut out some of the underscrub, and sadly
defaced the approaches to it, but left its primitive beauty unscarred.
But the whole tract was in danger for days, and that it escaped is
due to the energy of the local people, the force furnished by the rail
road and to the captaincy and courage of Professor Dudley of Stan
ford and a company of his students. IE9
. Fortunately the abundant rainfall of the region will wash away
the ashes that now deface the burned surface surrounding the park,
and in time the roads leading to it will measurably renew their
charms. But the peril remains like an unhappy -memory, and the
State should make provision against its recurrence. It was the
opinion of the State Board of Trade excursionists that the State
should acquire lands surrounding the park, some of which were then
timbered but have now been burned. In -that region of winter
moisture the reforesting. of burned or lumbered tracts is. made easy,
and the naked rim of land around the park offers an excellent field
for such an experiment.
If the current movement for the recession of the Yosemite? Valley
succeed, the State could profitably divert to the Redwood Park th e
appropriation now given to the valley, and it would suffice for needed
improvements to make the interior of the tract. accessibleVar.d; also
to protect it against fire. We should all, be thankful that the forest
remains to receive the care that its beauties deserve, KHIii

LONDON, Aug. 30.â Recently the
Marquis de Soveral was urged
to write a book on "The Art of
Fascination." It is said that he
replied: "I "couldn't if I would and
I wouldn't if I could." Yet no one is
better qualified for such a task, for
the Marquis de Soveral,; Portuguese
Envoy Extraordinary- arid Minister
Plenipotentiary at the court of SL
James, is acknowledged to be the
most fascinating man at present -in
London society. He is an intimate
friend of King Edward. He Is a great
favorite with Queen Alexandra, and
the story is current that their daugh
ter. Princess Victoria, has lost her
heart to him. Rumors of an Impend
ing wedding between them, though
for royalty that would be a ''distinct
mesalliance, are frequently revived.
Ladles of hlifh degree in various lands
have declared that - he is the ; most
charming man they . have ever. met.
Among men he is almost equally pop
ular. He is a. living : proof of -which
there have been many Illustrious ex
amples that in man fascination has
no necessary connection with . good
looks.' He is distinctly "a homely
man, with dark, swarthy features.' He
does not even possess > a;; good ; figure,
for he^is thickset and somewhat be
low the average height. He has blue
black hair and the hirsu te'grb wth"' ori
his face is so strong that even 'when
he shaves clean ; ; the lower, part ' of his
face looks # as if it had- been/ peppered

CALL HIM' "BLUE 'Â¦ MONKEY."
Speclal Correspondence,
To the intense chagrin of the French
visitors, they were all passed over and
the ball was opened with the little
Portuguese Minister as the Queen's
partner. The incident served to
strengthen the impression that there
is, after all, something in the gossip
which so persistently links his name
with that of Princess Victoria as her
future husband. There are scores of
wealthy and socially ambitious people
in London who would give half they
possess to learn of the Marquis how to
malce themselves equally fascinating.
ROYALTY HAS SWEET TOOTH.
A caller on one of the equerries of
the Prince of "Wales, some time before
the luncheon hour, -expressed surprise,
when recounting his experiences, at the
distinctive odor of Jam tarts cooking
and other confections which pervaded
the royal establishment. With the ex
ception of the King, whose devotion to
the weed long years ago spoiled his
youthful taste for sweets and lollipops,
all members of the royal family are
fond of confectionery. Queen Alexan
dra's preference is for chocolates.
While fond of them, too, the Princess
of Wales is especially devoted to fruit
f arcis. All her children are liberally
supplied with sweets and do not dis
dain even to suck at the plebeian toffy.
In these degenerate days among the
mighty the taste for sweets is by no
means restricted to aristocratic femin
inity. Several members of the. House
of Lords have a weakness for sweets
of all kinds and sometimes betray it
even when engaged in the discharge of
their : august â¢ functions as hereditary
legislators. /One noble. peer, especially,
may frequently . be - observed solacing
himself with 'bonbons in the course of
a debate. In . the . lower house there
are no less than thirty members who
never enter the Parliamentary chamber
without sweets of some sort in their
pockets. That doughty champion of
labor,; John Burns, u whose boast it is
he never wore an overcoat to shield his
robust "frame from wintry, blasts, is a
victim of the candy, habit. But .that
may be an inheritance from ,his
younger days when' he was employed
as', a 1 sugar - boiler. Titled American
wqmen who 1 . figure prominently Jn so

TO OBTAIN A PATENTâ R. D. F..
Broderick, Yolo County, CaL If you
have a good invention . for which you
desire to obtain a patent you can make
the attempt to obtain the same without
the assistance of a lawyer versed in
such matters, but at the same time you
run the chances, if not versed in pat
ent law rules, of having some "patent
law shark" taking advantage of your
ignorance in such matters, stealing
your ideas *and securing a patent. It
is- safest' to place the matter in the
hands of a reliable lawyer who attends
to patents. The fees for a patent are:
On filing an original application for a
patent, $15; on issuing an original pat

months." $10; for seven years.. $15; for
fourteen years, $30.
PAEANâ Subscriber. City. Paean is
the name given by some of the ancient
Greeks to a kind of lyric poetry con
nected with the worship of Apollo- The
oldest' paeans from Homer appear to
have been either hymns addressed to
that diety to appease his wrath, or
thanksgiving odes sung after danger
was over and glory won.. In later .peri
ods they were addressed to other dei
ties also. * According .to Xenophon tha
Lacedemonians sang a paean to Po
seidon after an earthquake and tha
Greek army in Asia .one 'to Zeus. In
modern usage paean is a song of tri
umph.

A N WRITER in the Saturday Evening Post tells interestingly of
the work of the Agricultural Department in plant introduc
tion and plant improvement. That work- is great enough to
stand on its own merit without enlarging it by seeming to see de
merit or ignorance in others. Discussing the olive product of Calir
fornia, the writer says: "The California olive growers tried to
pickle olives that ought to have been pressed for oil. They did this
because they did not know any better. Now the Agricultural De
partment has introduced the proper olive for pickling from Spain,
and they know better."
If that writer knew what he was writing about, which he did
not, he would have known fhat-lhe so-called queen olive imported
as a pickle is not an oil producer sufficient to make it profitable as
an oil olive. For that reason it is made into a rather harsh and
cranky pickle, used as a relish, but known to be indigestible. Cali
fornia olive growers knew all about that olive, and had no use for it.
They experimented with the ripe olives for pickling, to produce a
nutritious and delicious food, and gave the ripe olive pickle to com
merce as an addition to the supply of food stuffs. They did not do
this because they did not know any better, but because they knew
what they were doing. The ripe pickle contains all the oil of the
ripe olive, with its fine flavor. It is a free stone, and when properly
prepared keeps well in any climate, 'Â¦;':â¢ ;V
Professor Hayne of the State University issued a bulletin on
the ripe olive pickle and a formula ipr its preparation, to remove the
natural acridity of the fruit without destroying the oil and its flavor,
and many housewives in this State put up their own supply by using
his formula. These ripe olive pickles are an article of' diet here,
used with good bread they make a wholesome lunch, and they are

THE STOLEN KISS.
One woman whose light tan shoes
were so soiled as to be past wearing,
and who was at the time far from any
place where shoe dressings are sold,
concocted a "home remedy" which
worked well. Wetting a soft muslin
rag with water containing a few drops
of household ammonia, she rubbed
it with a little castile soap and ap
plied it to the back - of the shoes,
where failure would leave least plain
ly its mark. But there was no failure:
it worked admirably. The entire shoe
was thoroughly clean in five minutes.
She kept one hand inside the shoe to
hold it in shape and was careful not
to wet the rag so much as to soak
through the lining and also to rinse
off well before drying. Half an hour
later they were rubbed well for a few
minutes with a flannel rag and a nat
ural gloes obtained. â Chicago News.
SAVEDHER TANS.
T^HE bond campaign in Oakland goes on rather languidly. The
I opposition is full of technicalities and prints things about the
V\T'' bonds being a permanent lien on the prosperity of the city and
all that. Another says it is poor policy to issue bonds to invest in
unproductive property. There are some things that cannot be an
swered, to the satisfaction, of those who ask them. In this class are
many of the queries of those who are opposing bonds and progress in
Oakland.
The city's water park, they say, is unproductive property, it will
yield no income to the city's treasury, and therefore should be left
with mud shores and nasty surroundings. They oppose land parks
on the same ground, and also the building of a decent city hall in
place of the fossilized eczema. now in use for that purpose. Con
tinuing their argument they should oppose streets in a city, because
they yield no income. Schoolhouses are in the same Hst, and when
extended, the argument includes everything that distinguishes' a
modern civilized city from an Indian village made up of buffalo
skin wickyups. Sewers pay no income. . Therefore let us throw
everything out of the back door. . . .
Another form of opposition is regardful of the rights of pos
terity. When it is shown that the present generation will enjoy
the parks and other improvements and pay only, about a third of
the bonds, leaving two-thirds to posterity, then the objectors appear
as the attorneys of posterity and plead for it, rather tearfully. But
suppose the land is not bought now and improvements are not made,
the necessity for both will be passed on to posterity, and by that
time the land will cost ten times whaf it does now, and posterity
will pay over $20,000,000 for what can be had for $2,000,000. Then
posterity will deny its ancestry and wonder how such a pack of fools
ever had sense enough to come in when it rains.
The proposed bond issue will cost, interest and principal, when
paid up. S4.000.000, and by the time posterity pays the last assess
ment, if it doesn't like the parks, it can sell them for many times
So instead of passing a burden to posterity Oakland, if the
bonds arc carried, will be passing down an increasingly valuable
asset to future generations which should rather be envied than pitied.
That city has been talking parks for a generation. It has also been
abusing people who had foresight. When the late N. W. Spaulding
was Mayor, he was a clear-headed business man. Oakland was small
but he foresaw its growth, and had the city buy and secure a num
ber of schoolhouse sites, wh'en property was cheap. For this he
was abused and traduced, called. an official speculator in real estate,
and it was declared that the schoolhouse lots would never be needed.
Now they have long been occupied and would cost an immense sum
if they had to be bought. The city, needing more school room, is
now very sorry that Mr. Spaulding did not buy ten times as many
schoolhouse sites as he did. So time avenges the fuming of fools
and vindicates the wise men who could see ahead and provide for
the future. %
It is hoped thatOakland has learned something, and that among
her 80.000 people there is a majority of sober-minded men who know
the requirements of a modern city. It is hoped also that her people
have the desire for cleanness and beauty and realize the value of
their climatic asset and know how to take advantage" of it by giving
grace to the diversified surface of the town by garnishing it with
parks and foliage and flowers. 0
If the bonds are beaten, then the city will seem to have stirred
uneasily in its sleep, dreaming of better things, only to have the
vision pass, and settle down in its gutter to be known by its snore.
But if the bonds pass, the dream will crystallize into a reality, and
there will arise a new Oakland, famous all over the world, for its
water and land j>arkÂ«. its cleanness, its beauty and its many attrac
tions. Which srtall it be?

When you sit down to rest, be still,

A long-continued noise might have a

absurd to Jump and start as coma

the nerves themselves, whereas, if
the nerves are allowed to run riot,

Giving way to nerves without a strug

attorney asked for a continuance and
the defendant's counsel demanded an
immediate hearing, arguing that the
complaining witness, Fairfax Wheelan..
has been, in possession of his alleged
facts since August .9 and should > be
able to proceed with the examination
at once. What threatened to be a
long wrangle between the lawyers was
averted by the Judge stating, that his

Miss Kerr was originally booked for
erand larceny, but the charge has
been reduced to petty, and on the lat
ter ehe will be tried next Tuesday be
fore Judge Mogan.
Judge Cabaniss dismissed a battery
charge against Oscar Beine, seaman
aboard the German ship Hathor, who
was specifically accused of having bat
tered the head of aS Vallejo-street bar
tender with a beer glass. The dismis
sal was caused through the unwilling
ness of the complaining witness to
prosecute, coupled with the fact that
the Hathor clears to-morrow for Ant-
a posse of policemen, led by
Sergeant Ellis, attempted to board the
Hathor to arrest Beine they were re
pelled by First Mate Miller, who aver
red that his crew was protected, by the
German flag and that only an order
from the German Consul would be re
spected by him. Mate Miller, stalwart,
black whiskered and frock coated. Was
in court to explain his conduct to the
Judge and incidentally to plead for
Seaman Belne's dismissal, and when
Judge Cabaniss saw him sitting in the
back row and Inquired who he was,
some wag replied that he was the
chaplain of the Russian cruiser Lena.
Then the Judge ordered' the, bailiff to
give the distinguished looking stranger
a choice seat in the Jury box and not

stand and disclosed his identity* was
the court disillusioned.
Lewis Tevis, arrested for wooing
Morpheus at midday in Union Square,
proved he was not a vagrant and ex
plained that he had dined heavily and
was overtaken by resistless slumber as
he was aiding digestion by taking a
post-prandial stroll In the square. He
was dismissed by Judge Conlan. .
. Pat McDonald, able seaman aboard
the scow schooner Flossie Ferguson,
swore he was "nagged" to insubordina
tion by Mate Oscar Johnson of the
same handy craft. Mate Johnson, it
seemed, bore a grudge against Pat and
studiously created opportunity where
by he could vent his malice without
actually appearing tyrannical. On one
of these occasions, it was testified, the
mate attempted to punctuate a profane
harangue by beating Pat's head with
an iron belaying pin and when Pat, to
protect his' cranium, struck the mate
and knocked him down upon the Flos
sie Ferguson's snowy orlop deck, he
was placed under arrest. Judge Caban
iss decided that Pat was more Binned
against than sinning and dismissed the
case in accordance with that deci-

A- R. Murray and four fellow-va
grants were arrested at 2 o'clock yes
terday morning while they were smok

safety of the Harrison wharf. Snuggled
amid hay bales, the vagabonds were
carelessly lighting matches and tossing
red-hot tobacco ashes upon their in
flammable couch when Patrolmen
Xolan and Rler swooped down upon
them. Judge Mogan gave them twenty
four hours' imprisonment..
James Pappas, fruit dealer at 114
Ellis street, was dozing in his store
when a man sneaked in and abstracted
$55 from his pocket and in the court of
Judge Conlan he alleged that Roy F.

George and Linda were living in vag
abondage for several months .prior to
their wedding. On the marriage record
his residence was given as 1726 Hyde
street, and she was alleged to dwell at
19 Lily avenue. But it was stated by
Patrolman E. A- Marsh that the young
man had the girl housed in a polling
booth at Larkin and Filbert streets un
til the municipal authorities removed
her lodging place, when he transferred
her to the empty basement of 19 Lily
avenue. Her food supply consisted
chiefly of crackers and bologna sausage
pilfered by her consort from the free
lunch tables of cheap saloons. She was
in a pitiable plight when Mrs. Pettie
discovered her and forced the youth to
make her his wife.
George Lundberg, aged 22 years, was
married to Miss Linda Badger, aged 19
years, by Judge Cabaniss. Mrs. John

ing what kind of x>roperty you prefer In ex-
change, and you will be surprised bow quickly

tious nsture tor some of the movement. The
continued advance of Pennsylvania and the
United States Â£ltcl_fctocks was the most influ
ential factor in shaping sentiment on the gen
eral rr.arkrt. and w&s fairly effective In sup
porting the level of prices in the face of profit
takicg in tome of the stocks which have made
previous Vrtklnx advances. Aside from re
ports t.t a crowing exnanston in the needs of
Â«teÂ«l eroducts, there was no news concerning
either Drooerty cnlesa it was the denial or a
report current yesterday of the placing of ad
ditional orders for 100,000 tons of FteÂ«I rails
for Harriman railroads. There were rumors
cf an important short Interest in United States
Steel stocks, which was making difficulties in
covering, and the urgent demand for those
gave plausibility to the report. Last night's
frosts were reported to have fallen as far short
of the dreaded damage to corn .as thoee of the
r.'.rbt before, but the grangers and Pacifies
were distinctly htavy after the opening. An
other source of uneasiness was the marketing
of a larce block of Colorado Fuel, which had
the asi>earance of an order to sell at the
market- price. Et. Paul was not helped by Its
annual showing of net earnings, and Srnelt
lng'c Increased earnings for the year resulted
in a decline for that stock. It was asserted
that freight traffic on. the Trunk lines was be
coming heavy- The full foreign trade state
ment for Aurust partly offset the unfavorable
UrpresKlon caused by th^showicg of exports
for domestic producets. The showing. It will
be remembered, shewed a shrinkage of $7.6S9,
292 compared with the preceding August, while
the total exÂ»ortÂ» show an Increase of $6,242.-
C24, the Inference being that the discrepancy
is made up by a growth of manufacturing ex
ports. This is tuppoeed to point to increased
eteel exports.
The markirur un of the call loan rate to 2
per ctnt evidently foreshadows a further
Ehrinkage in the bank surplus, and was an
Influent in the growing weakness of the stock
market which carried the grangers and Pa
cific* and a few of the Eastern stocks a point
or more below last nieht and largely reduced
the *alns elsewhere. Bankers' lean bills also
made their appearance in the foreign exchange
market and forced down the sterling rate, sug
gesting the likely source of relief for any
marked growth in the demand for money. The
stock, market cloeed eaÂ»y.
Bonds were firm. Total sales, par value,
$4,555,000. United States bonds were un

There have be?n hints lately that the very
low prices for Prunes are not due to the le
gitimate law of supply and demand, but are
being published broadcast by certain Interests
who want to bear the market to serve their
private ends." Now comes the New York Jour
nal of Commerce and says In this connection:
"Telegrams received yesterday from the Coast
report that the weather in the prune producing
districts is th? hottest ever known, and its
effect upon the fruit Is to make ' it run to
smaller sizes. This may have the effect of
chocking the downward tendency of the mar
ket, which is attributed largely to the efforts
of a considerable short interest to depress
values. Commenting upon this report, a local
paper said: 'It is barely possible that the
short interest may yet be caught.' "

CHICAGO. Sept. 15.â Snow in the Canadian
Northwest and a reported decrease in the
total Russian crop were conspicuous causes
to-day in turning the wheat market upward.
At the close the December ' option showed a
gain of 1Â«Â»Â©1%c. At the outset sentiment In
the wheat pit was weak, largely in sympathy
with a sharp break In corn prices, the non
appearance of predicted heavy frosts being
the - depressing Influence affecting the coru
market.- Some of the initial weakness was
possibly traceable to tho estimated size of the
croi> as given out by two well-known trade
journals. The figures in both instances made
the total yield about 540,000.000 bushels, an
amount considerably larger than several pre
vious private crop estimates. When trading
bc.an a lot of lone wheat was thrown upon
the market, causing an opening loss In Decem
ber of %Â©%c, first eales being made at SI 13%
to ?l 13Tg- May was unchanged to %c lower
at .51 1.V.N to $1 16. After December had sold
off to $1 13% and May to $1 15% the market
rallied on covering by shorts. Before the end
of the first half-hour all of the opening loss.
had been regained. Later in the day there
were advices from Winnipeg claiming poor
thrashing returns. A semi-official report from
Russia indicated a crop of spring wheat 20
â¢ * r cent lighter than the one of last year.
Wintry weather in the extreme Northwest was
a decisive additional bull influence. On the
improved demand prices rose rapidly. Decem
ber advancing to $1 16%. May sold up to
$1 17%. The market was nervous later in the
day. Bearish Argentine ne.ws brought out
considerable selling, which resulted in a mod
' erate. reaction. The elese was firm, with De
cember at ?1 15%<&1 15%. May closed at $1 16%
61 IT, a rain of Tic, as compared with last
n'ght'a final figures.
A precipitous decline in corn prices occurred
at the opening as a result of heavy realizing
saleg. Covering by rhorts caused a temporary
rally - toward the middle of the session, but
the- advance was not held. J>cember opened
%6%c to l%*rl%c lower at 51%c to 52%c,
held within , the opening range, closing at
W,Â«@52%c.
The demand for oats was small and value?
were a shade lower. December opened %o
to %c lower at 32?ic to 33c, \ sold between
3-*%c and 33c and closed at 32%Â©32Tjc.
Selling by pit traders on the break in corn
caused an easier feeling In provisions. At the
close January pork was up 5'37%c at $12 77%
Â©12 80. Lard and ribs were a shade lower
at 57 17% and ?6 6T>86 67%. respect lvely.

prospects. Brokers' wires from Chicago yes
terday said: "Frosts were general from the
Missouri River eastward, but with the ex
ception of a few localities In Iowa they were
generally light and supposed to be harmless.
On this there were large liquidating tales.
Several commission houses were large buyers.
Later In the day the market ruled steady.
That some one is accumulating large holdings
of May corn is apparent. The short Interest
Is quite general- and in the. aggregate heavy.
The Indications are for little higher tempera

now helps the crop, but there is considerable
percentage that needs good weather."

. Trade in the- fruit market was active on -lo
cal account and aside from Melons and Ber
ries, choice offerings of all descriptions met
with a good demand at well maintained rates.
Berries bad to be sold at low prices, aa the
bulk of the day's receipts were- not delivered
until late, after most buyers had left the mar
ket. .Owing to. the continued cool weather,
there was very little inquiry for Melons, and
stocks were steadily accumulating. Strictly
fancy Gravensteln and Bellflower Apples were
still bringing $1 50 per box. but the market
was overstocked with low grade offerings and
there were no settled prices for that class of
fruit. Plums. Prunes, good' Peaches. Figs and
eating Pears were steady, while ordinary
Peaches and cooking Pears were dull at ir
regular ' prices. Table grapes In small pack
â¢ ages were plentiful, but brought good prices,
i trade being brisk despite the cool weather.
Large open boxes were scarce and firm at the
outside* quotations ' during the early trade,
but the market- weakened upon the arrival of
the belated Stockton steamer with fresh sup
plies and most of the late arrivals had to be
held over. There was very little doing in
Wine Grapes and only the best stock received
: any attention. A fair amount of business was
reported |n Citrus and Tropical fruits. Fancy

The board, in its resolution, says that
it is deplorable that tv-hite children
should be excluded* from the schools
because of the' necessity of receiving
Japanese pupils and equally deplora
ble that white children and Mongolians
should be educated together, in the
public schools. Many of the Japanese
in the grammar, grades are youths of
eighteen to twenty years of age and
these are In the same classrooms and
often sit in the same scats with white
girls and boys of tender age.
. Mrs. E. M. North presented a peti
tion to the board to be retired . as a
teacher in . order that she may avail
herself of the Teachers* Annuity and
Retirement Fund. Her request was
granted, with, the provision -Â¦ that : the
board is not Hable^inany way; for the

.The question of the coeducation of
white and â¢ Mongolian â¢ children In [ the
public schools ..was again i the ; subject
of ' debate the', regular meeting of
the Board of Education yesterday. The
pressing need of a separate class or >
separate school for the -instruction of
Japanese and the' .'lack '. of i funds to
nieet that need were' the* subjects of
a resolution asking : the ; Board . of Su
pervisors to act at once. r>.
The resolution declares -that? the al
ready overtaxed accommodations of
the public schools are being further
taken up by : the Japanese pupils, of
ten to the enforced exclusion of white
children. Under the opinion . rendered
by the City j Attorney the board is
obliged to allow the comingling of
whites and : Mongolians until a separ
ate'school for Japanese shall be estab

If the commanding of fleers of police at flreÂ«
did their duty in a common . sens- manner
there would be no occasion for communications
of â¢ this sort. Â¦ Â¦ I was ; much surprised on ar
riving at the scene of a large flrÂ« on Howard
street, between .Seventh and Eighth, on th*
5th Inst.. to find the police lines stretched be
tween the burning bulldtncs and the (fire ap
paratus. Of course the people who wen at
tracted by the fire ' crowded up against thÂ«
lines and thus the firemen were compelled to
lose considerable â¢ time - In - forcing their - way
through the crowds to (ret to their apparatus
for 'needed articles, ladders, etc.
A mere novice- In -police business should
know that the police lines should be stretched
behind the fire apparatus : and not In " front
and that the -space between - the fire and th*
location of the Â¦ fire Â¦ engines, ..trucks, -hose
wasons,' etc.. -must b* kept- clear 'so that thÂ«
firemen can have free access to them.
It is hoz>ed that - all â¢ members of the Police
Department (Lieutenant Colby.' in' particular)
will. bear this in mind and act accordingly in
the future.- -. .^XSBSBWMCnBMBHBHBBHH

â¢ The alleged inefficient management of

gestion from the Board of Fire Com

"Upon the recommendation of the act
ing chief engineer of this department
we respectfully /suggest. that you cause
an order to be made to your subordi
nates to the effect. that whenever a fire
of any magnitude occurs the street or
streets on which any. streams are work
ing be roped off at the crossings of the
main streets on each side of the fire,
and that all intervening streets be
closed, either by ropes or by officers
stationed in them, as these arrange
ments would greatly facilitate the
workings of this department at such
flres."
