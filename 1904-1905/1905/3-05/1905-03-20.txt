Special Dispatch to The Call.
SIOUX CITY, lowa, March 19.âBe
cause he is a good horse trader Rev.
S. Koster of Orange City will lose his
license as a minister of the gospel. He
was tried by a board of twelve Dutch
Reformed clergymen. The evidence
showed that he had managed to get the
better of several men in horse trades,
manifesting a capability for business
quite worldly.
The board decided that such compe
tence was not compatible with priestly
robes. Solemnly and with great seri
ousness the incriminating evidence was
weighed. The accused was found want
ing.
Yesterday a verdict was returned,
finding Mr. Koster guilty of "sharp
practice in horse trading." He will be
unfrocked at once.
POPE CLOSES
A DRUGSTORE
Pius X Objects to the Sale
of Liquor Within Walls
of the Papal Residence
Special D!Â»patch to Tbe Call.
ROME, March 19. â The Vatican
drug store, which was established by
the late Pope to supply the, needs of
the 3000 or more persons who form
the population of the papal residence,
has been closed by order of Pius X.
It was about twenty-five years ago
that the late Pope asked tbe brothers
of St. John of God, whose especial
line is hospital work, to open a drug
store for the use of Vatican residents
and rooms were assigned for the pur
pose, opening upon the court of San
Damaso. In a short time, however, as
packages addressed to the Vatican are
exempt from customs inspection and
tax, the new drug store was in a posi
tion to undersell all similar stores in
Rome and in consequence it got many
patrons who had previously bought of
the city drug stores. The brothers in
charge took advantage of this increase
in trade to extend their operations.
Recently Pius X learned that liquors
were sold within the Vatican .walls
and he ordered it stopped. Brother
Diodato, who had been in charge of
the drug store since its foundation,
was told of the Pope's wishes, and. as
he resisted, he was transferred to an
other convent and the Vatican phar
macy was closed forever.

To the suggestion of the possibility
of an alliance between Russia and
Japan, the Minister said:
*A reasonable peace must first be
established."
"What," was asked, "would be
reasonable?"
"Broadly speaking, Russia's re
nunciation of her entire Manchurian
policy should satisfy Japan's claims.
Japan could have her protectorate
over Korea, such privileges on :he
Kwantung Peninusla and at Port Ar
thur as the powers would not oppose,
and the Chinese Eastern Railway
could be placed under international
control, Russia maintaining her rights
to a railway line through Northern
Manchuria to Vladivostok."
"What would be Russia's attitude on
the subject of indemnity?"
"Russia never has paid indemnity,
and history practically affords no prec
edent for indemnity when territory is
not occupied to Insure payment, and
Japan holds not a foot of Russian ter
ritory. Japan could, however, take the
proceeds of the sale of the property and
rights of the Chinese Eastern Railway.
which was built with Russian money."'
Proceeding, the Minister said the dif
ficulties of continuing the war were
fully appreciated, both from a military
and a financial standpoint, but neither
was insurmountable. He denied em
phatically that the negotiations for a
French loan were adjourned because
Russia would -Â«t make peace. He ex
pected that these negotiations would
be resumed soon. The suacess of the
Internal loan, fl -st announced by the
press on Saturday, the Minister said,
was assured.
As for the question of a new army,
much depended upon the exact situa
tion when General Linevitch got the
army out of danger.
The Minister said further that "com
pletp details of General Kuronntkin'a

the Japanese reports are greatly exag

guns and many hundred cars were left

"No new general mobilization has been

this morning to take from the mines
the bodies of their fellow workmen and

-The first explosion seemed to shak'?
the foundation of the Tiwaritatns and
the flash from the two neighboring drift
mouths lighted up the heavens for miles
around. Soon from the mining villages
for several miles up and down the river
hundreds of people rushed to the scene
of the disaster. The first explosion was
caused by a naked flame in contact
with the gas. The flames leaped from
the drift mouth and set fire to every
thing in the mines which was not
blown out by the force of the explo
sion.
The great drum by which the cars
are run from the drift mouth down
the incline to the tipple and the empties
drawn up was blown down the moun
tain side 600 feet. The drumhouse
caught fire and was totally consumed.
The cars that stood at the mouth of
the mine were blown far down toward
the tipple, and much of the track of
the incline was destroyed, the rails
twisted and the crossties whipped
from their beds in the ballast and sent
scorched and charred many yards
away.
A rescue party was formed and about
twenty men entered the mine in search
of the bodies of those who had Der
ished at the first explosion. The men
explored the mines for two or three
hours, putting up brattices so that pure
air should follow them wherever they
went. Finally some of them came out
and reported that the others were too
careless, going forward faster than
good air was being supplied, carrying
at the same time a naked lierht. At
3:45 a. m. another awful explosion oc
curred, caused by the gas coming in
contact with the naked flame of a
miner's lamp, and fourteen men Der
ished.
Mine Inspector Edward Pinckney ar
rived on the gTound to-day and took
charge of the rescue work. The second
explosion again damaged the fan. and
Pinckney will allow no one to enter
the mine until It Is working properly
and a draft of fresh air is runnine
through the mine. When this is done
he will lead' the rescue squad himself.

SALT LAKE. March 19.â Millions
of dollars have been lost to the Gov
ernment of the United States through
tbe alleged machinations of plotters,
who have sought by devious means to
gain control of valuable mineral lands
in Utah.
Investigation made by persons not
connected with the Government ser
vice discloses that not less than 320,
000 acres of coal lands are involved.
If the Government had received pa>
for this at the legal rate of $20 per
acre it would be richer by $6,400,000.
Powerful influences are known to
be at work in Washington to head off
an investigation which may result in
the recovery by the Government of
rich properties and the indictment of
men of prominence.
Among the men whose interests are
at stake are John D. Rockefeller and
George J. Gould of New York, who
are seeking to gain control of the coal

PMtara] Calls ijwn Her to Arise and

ST. PETERSBURG*, March 20. â
Metropolitan Antonius has issued a
remarkable pastoral address arraign
ing- the Russia of to-day for vanity,
frivolity, dissipation and impiety, the
just punishment of which is the humi
liation of the nation, and preaching
repentance and the fear of God. The
pa&tora] says:
It is not for the first time that on holy
Russia has fallen dire misfortunes; but then
Ku?sia was a wholly different country, .-trong
In the love of holy religion, and impregnabk
in devotion to the Emperor and the fatherland.
Now. while carrying on a great war instead
of I'ongreiratlnÃ in a spirit of high and self
denying patriotism, internal dissension reigns
in the land, everything is overthrown, science
is neglected and what is holy is trampled upon
During the carnival days last week, while
our heroes were dying in unequal combat, wat
ering the battlefields with their blood, we dan d
even then abandon ourselves to the usual ex.
ess and days of feasting and unseemly dissi
pation. With right we are despised by all,
mocked at by all the peoples of the earth.
Awake, then, holy orthodox Russia; fear CJod;
cleanse thyself from the stain of the foulness
of thy sins; repent, enlighten thyself, and God
will give thee grace.

JAPANESE ARE MARCHING
PARALLEL TO THE SLAVS
Flanking Columns Keeping
Pace With Linevitch's
Retreating Army.
GDNSHU PASS (about 166 miles
north of Mukden), March 19. â Morning.
The first army, which has been cov
ering the retreat of the Russian forces
from the south, is withdrawing slowly,
checking comparatively light attacks
by the Japanese. The Japanese are
conducting a Hanking operation *>n the
right, and from the Russian columi
Japanese batteries are visible, keeping
pace a short distance away.
The Red Cross detachments at all of
the intermediate stations to Harbin
are working night and day, operating
upon, bandaging and feeding the
wounded.
The Chinese are leaving Gunshu
Pass for Kirln and the labor question,
Therefore, is growing critical, though
the Chinese receive the unprecedentedly
high wagts of 40 to 30 cents a day.
On Saturday, . while the correspond
ent was proceeding almost with the
rear guard, he stopped at a Chinese
village, where several natives came to
the commanding officer and asked for
permission to accompany the column
with their families, saying the women
feared the Japanese, who treated them
worse than did the Chinese bandits.
Practically the entire village accepted
j the officers' permission to accompany
] the rear guard.
The Japanese have ordered all Chi
; nese in Mukden having Russian money
i to appear at the police station and ex
change paper and silver money for
Japanese notes issued especially for
Manchuria.
The mistake was made, before the
destruction of several Russian commis
sariat depots, of issuing spirits to pri
vate soldiers to whom officers had
given requisition slips.
AFTERMATH OF BATTLE.
Belated Dispatches Give Incidents of
Fighting and Retreat.
ST. PETERSBURG, March 20.â A
sheaf of belated press dispatches filed
at Mukden, Tie Pass and Kaiyuan
reached St. Petersburg last evening,
having been discovered among other
papers committed to the censor at the
front, where they had lain from a week
to twelve days.
Writing under date of March 8, the
correspondent mentions that General
Kuropatkin's confident declaration of
satisfaction with the situation had
steadied and encouraged the army
after eight days' battle until the
wounded, exceeding In number those of
the battle of Liaoyang, were crowding
the station and the Russian settlement,
and in the settlement cemetery chap
lains were conducting funeral ceremo
nies. A few quotations from the corre
spondent's note book indicate the grew
someness of the scene:
Everywhere are pale fates of corpses sleep
ing among dead horses, slaughtered animals
and abandoned quarters of beef. Bloody band
ages which had fallen oft strew the roads.
There is bursting shrapnel everywhere. A
wagon train ahead had stopped, and two
roldlers are quarreling about horse feed. D^ad
and wounded are passing on the shoulders of
si.ldiers or in mule carts or Chinese vehicles.
Here one Russian and one Japanese wounded
side by side feed each other; there lie seven
Japanese wounded to whom big Russians are
attentive. In tlv? soft sunshine grave diggers
aro at work on all the roadways. Japanese
officers who had been taken prisoners are seen
in the streets. Everywhere are evidences that
the two great armies have come closer than
ever before.
In the concluding portion of a dis
patch from Tie' Pass, the first part of
which was published March 11, the cor
respondent states that, according to in
formation, the Japanese strength at
Mukden was eighty battalions less than
ihat of the Russians. The Japanese
also were inferior in guns at many
places. The number of men at the be
ginning of the battle was 700,000, man
ning the greatest field works ever con
structed. Not only In duration and
number of troops and guns engaged did
the battle exceed all former contests,
but also in expenditure of ammunition.
Describing the retreat, the dispatch
pictures debris strewn along the road,
marching soldiers increasing their
loads by spearing bread, vegetables or
fruit on their bayonets, at the same
time discarding heavy boots, Chinese
garments, knapsacks and blankets. The
correspondent then continues:
After the initial excitement at Tava, where
a few wagoners plunged without reason over
impassable gulches, the entire body arrived at
tht steep banks of the Pu River, where heavy
artillery hastened down upon the ice, which
slowly gave way, and tremendous exertion was
required in getting the guns out and up the
bank.
Th-e passage of a division through the re
trsatlne column en route to the southwest to
strengthen the right flank gave confidence of
short duration, for Japanese cavalry overtook
us at Santaitzc.
The road and fields are a solid mass of
transports and the dust Is so formidable that
it is Impossible to see a hundred yards. Jap
anese grenades gave the Initial Impression of
shrapnel, and with rifle fire set the jammed
mass into confusion. I">aybreak disclosed the
plain covered with riderless horsts. horseless
vehicles, fragments of harness and heaps of
stores and furniture. Night found the army
bravely bivouacking on bare plain sjvept by a
cold, searching wind, with not a single dug
out lo shelter it, but preparing a new position.
under date of Kalyuan, Jlarch 13, the
correspondent says:
The Russian army east of the point where
the Japanese pierced the line at F*u Pass was
entirely unaffected by confusion during March
10. Fully two battalions of mixed troops es
caped north by rail and were found at Ounshu
Pass, 165 miles northward.
The Japanese in battle employed phenomenal
Innovations unknown to European military
practice, showing that they are not mere copy
ists. One Japanese detachment had the Rus
sians beaten near the northern tombs and
could have entered Mukden two days earlier,
but retreated simultaneously with the oppos
ing- Russian regiments.
MEXICO CITY, March IS.â Articles of in
corporation for the Rio Grande, Sierra Madre
and Pacific Railway, capitalized at $3,000,000,

General Kuroki's Men Are
Again in the Forefront
of the Pursuit.
GENERAL. KUROKI'S I^AD
QUARTERS. Saturday, March 18.â
General Kurokis army continues to
lead the Japanese forces, whfeh have
now been engaged for nine days in a
hard pursuit, ln which they have cov
ered a distance of more than 95 miles
with frequent fighting.
The weather in the mountains is very
cold, with frequent hard storms. The
brigade* in advance occupied Tie Pass
on Wednesday night after a brief en
gagement.
The Russian retreat became more
disorganized daily after the storm.
During the first day the Russians
buried their dead, but since then they
have left the dead wherever they fell.
On Tuesday the Russians made an at
tempt at resistance in intrenchments
north of the Hun River, but retired
after they had been shelled for two
hours.
General Kurokis army captiired the
colors of the Fifth Regiment of Rifles. '
The colors were presented to the fegi
mc-nt by the Emperor in 1863. Most of i
the" captured organizations succeeded !
IH burning their standards before suf- j
rendering. A few prisoners are taken
daily.
It is reported that during General
Kuropatkin's resistance at Tower Hill
on the first day's fighting he waa
slightly wounded by an 11-inch shell
which fell near him.
The Chinese officials reeelve the Jap
anese generals with soldiers and ban
ners at most of the larger town* en
tered. A
Everything now appears to be in fa
vor of the Japanese. They have a
magnificent army in the highest spirits,
which is rapidly recuperating from the
effects of the recent battle, and which
is fully equipped with everything nec
essary for Manchurian campaigning,
including great quantities of supplies
accumulated the winter, to
gether with several lines of communi
cation and the best season of the year
before them.
The gain of the strongest natural
position on the entire railway (Tie
Pass), whereon much money and labor
was expended in defenses under Gen
eral Kuropatkin's personal direction,
without a battle, was hardly expected.
The greatly elated army shows how
thoroughly beaten/ are the Russians.
All indications point to a continuance
of the retreat of the latter to Harbin.
Before leaving the town the Russians
fired railway buildings and those sup
plies which they were unable to trans
port.

put forward by the British Govern
ment in violation of international law
and entirely apart from the owners'

You Must
Sleep.
If you cannot, it is due to an
irritated or congested state of
the brain, which will soon de-
velope into nervous prostration.
Nature demands sleep, and
it is as important as food ; it *
is a part of her building- and
sustaining process. This period
of unconsciousness relaxes the
mental'and physical strain, and
allows nature to restore ex-
hausted vitality. *
Dr. Miles' Nervine brings
refreshing sleep, because it
soothes the irritation and re-
moves the congestion.
. It is also a nerve builder; it
. nourishes and strengthens ev-
ery nerve in your body, and
creates energy in all the organs.
Nothing will give strength
and vitality as surely and
quickly as Dr. Miles' Nervine.
"During: the past winter I had two
attacks of LaGrlppe which left ma
â very weak, and In bad condition. I
".was so nervous I could not sleep. My
wife, after trying different reined'
' went for a doctor. The doctor was
out, and a neighbor recommended Dr.
i Miles' Nervine, and Â«he brought horn*
a bottle. I had not slept for some time,
and had terrible pains in my head.
After taking a few doses of NervlnÂ«
the pain was not â <> severe, and X -
slept. I am now taking the second
bottle, and am very much Improved."

Eemarkable Home-Coming
of the Man Deposed as Gov

GREETED BY POPULACE
Late Executive in Feeling
Speech Says He Prefers
Being Robbed to Robbing
PUEBLO, Colo., March 19.â Former
Governor Alva Adams was welcomed
home this afternoon with one of the
largest and most enthusiastic popular
demonstrations ever accorded to a man
in this city's history. The streets
around the Union station and extend
ing for blocks in all directions were one
mass of humanity. Adams was es
corted to a stand in front of the Union
station, where he delivered a short ad
dress. He spoke as follows:
It Is possible tor me to express what is
in my heart oa this day as a result of the
great ovation you have given me. You have
made this day for me one of the proudest In
mv lilc. and on* that I will remember for
ever.
I com* home to you defeated, but my hands
are clean. I want to say that I did my
duty as best I could and I feel at this hour
that I would rather be robbed than to rob.
While here ,1 want to pay a tribute to
those who stood by me during this content â
not as Democrats or Republicans, but as citi
zens cf this State â in Justice. In right. In
upholding the laws, the constitution and the
ballot of the people.
I wish to say that robbery bears no political
brand, but bears the brand of pirates, and no
honest citixen will uphold , this kind of a
rol.bery-
X do not feel the wrong that has been done
me. It it not such a wrong to me as it Is
to you and I hop* to see the hour when
retribution will com* down upon those men of
Colorado who are controlled by corporations
and serve these corporations as their masters.
This Is not a political question, but a ques
tion of the preservanoe of the laws of this
Btate and of duty. - ""' ._ , ,
I have no regrets. I would rather stand In
the hearts of the people as 1 am to-day than
to st*nÂ«i under the Capitol dome of any State
of thÂ« United States as chief executive.
I thank you from my heart for th* recep
tion.
After his address the Governor, ac
companied by his wife, entered their
carriage, which had been almost filled
, with flowers by their admirers. The
carriage, drawn by a hundred enthusi
astic citizens, headed by a brass band,
proceeded to the Governor's home.
When Adams reached home there was
a crowd of intimate friends and neigh
bors to welcome him. To this gather
ing he made a short speech of thanks
for their welcome.

International Agricultural
Scheme Indorsed by Men
From European Countries
GATHERING IN VIENNA
Delegates From Germany,
Italy, Austria and Spain
Approve of the Proposal
VIENNA, March 19. â A further de
cided step toward the establishment of
an International Chamber of Agricul
ture, proposed by David Lubln of Cal
ifornia and submitted to the powers of
the world by the King of Italy, was
taken in Vienna to-day.
At the iavitation of Reichsritter
Hohenblum, head of the Austrian De
partment for the Protection of Agri
culture and Forests, there assembled
here to-day representatives of the
agricultural interests of Germany, Aus
tria-Hungary, Spain and Italy for the
purpose of informing themselves con
cerning the proposed chamber. The
conference was opened by Lubin, who
read an Interesting address, fully ex
plaining the plan and scope of the en
terprise. Several members, including
Prince Borghese of the Italian com
mittee, to which was intrusted the
carrying out of the preliminary ar
rangements of the conference of the
nations to be held in Rome, were pres
ent and reported satisfactory progress.
Members of the congress will commu
nicate to their respective organizations
the information acquired at to-day's
meeting through the "commendable,
foresighted initiative of the King of
Italy."
The plan was declared to be of the
greatest importance and value to
national and international agriculture.
King Victor Emmanuel's efforts were
fully indorsed and the conference ex-
Pressed a hope that the co-operation
or the exiitlng agricultural institutions
would be secured in furthering inter
national communication in the solu
tion of agricultural problems. The
conference especially recommended
the holding of international agricul
tural congresses at propitious times
and the establishment of an interna
tional agricultural association to fix
and control the prices of grain.
OLD PENNSYLVANIA TOWN
OPENS ITS FIRST CHURCH
For a Century and a Quarter Walls-
borough Had No House of
Worship.
BRADDOCK, Pa., March 19. â An
enlightened community without a
church until to-day has been the
status of Wallsborough, four miles
from this city.
The town has existed more than a
century and a quarter. For thirty
years it has been the terminal of the
Pennsylvania Ballroad's suburban ser
vice east. Its Immense transfer shops
and car and engine works employ 4000
men.
No itinerant preachers went there
until a year ago last October, when
Rev. L P. Truxat of this city founded
a mission of the United Brethern
Church. In a week he had twenty
eight members, and in six months he
started a church building. To-day a
brick church, costing 112,000, was
consecrated, free from debt.
The pastor, as a result of a fort
night's revival service, accepted
seventy converts into the church this
morning.

NOVEL SCHEME
OF CAPITALISTS
Wealthy Men of Los Angeles
Want to Control Saloon
Business in Southern City
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES, March 19.â 1n
Â£ood faith and meaning what they
say, a syndicate of Los Angeles capi
talists has made a proposition to the
City Attorney and Board of Police
Commissioners, which, if it were
adopted, would revolutionize the
saloon business here. Their plan is
to Americanize the Guttenburg: plan
and apply it here, assuring the city of
an ample return financially and being
certain that they themselves would
make an enormous profit.
They propose to have the present
200 licenses revoked and Instead fifty
or seventy-five licenses issued to the
company. They would place their
saloons in charge of competent per
sons under such regulations as do not
now exist in any American city.
Treating would be considered a mis
demeanor.
Coffee and Â»oft drinks would be
served, as well as intoxicants, and a
forfeit would be paid for every drink
sold to an intoxicated person. The
drinking- pi aces would be made attract
ive, and the prices uniform.
But for the fact that this proposition
is seriously backed by a number of
men of wealth It would be taken as a
Joke, but the proponents offer to guar
antee the city $180,000 per year for the
exclusive privilege and to spend a lib
eral amount in public improvements.
The syndicate will make the formal
offer, and if it is refused will assist
in the present strenuous campaign to
bring to a vote in Los Angeles the
question of saloons or no saloons.

HENRY B. RUSS DIES OF
APPENDICITIS.
Olympic Club President Pays Tribute to the Pioneer's Memory
HENRY B. RUSS. WELI^-KNOWN
PIONEER, WHO DIED YESTER
DAY AT GERMAN HOSPITAL.
Henry B. Russ, a pioneer of this
State, and one of the foremost citi
zens of this city, died early yesterday
morning at the German Hospital of
appendicitis. He leaves a widow. Anna I
Russ, and several sons and daughters, j
Mrs. John L. Hoffman and Mrs. George |
Habenicht, Henry S., Edward F., !
Lunde B. and Inyo A. Russ.
Henry B. Russ was best known i
through his connections with the j
Olympic Club, being one of the found- |
era of the institution in 1862, and he
had been linked with the organiza- j
tion ever since.
He filled offices from the president
down, and had for more than thirty
years faithfully performed the duties
of treasurer for the club. Being a born j
athlete, his efforts were always for the j
betterment of the physique of the ris
! ing generation.
Russ was born at Mount Hope, New
York, September 25, 1840. He was the j
youngest son of the honorable old pion- i
eer, I. C. Christian Russ. He came to \
'â  the Golden State with his father in ',
1847. Henry Rubs was one of the first !
: boys to attend the public schools of this '
city, being a pupil of John Swett,

cators.

his wife's brother, J. E. Hammersmith,
at the Russ House, dealing in fancy
goods, toys, notions, etc.

for Supervisor of the Tenth Ward in
I 1881, and he was elected to office. This
j was the only public office hfe ever held,
though he was sought again by the
Republican party to accept the nomi
nation for Auditor, but he refused it,
his principal object being that he de
â  sired to devote his attention to aiding
, the Olympic Club.
In 1868 he made an extensive tour
of Europe. On his return he devoted
his attention to the administration of
â  the Russ estate, which Included the
Russ House on Montgomery street.
In 1875 his first wife died in Los An
geles and in 1879 he married Miss Anna
Sievers, who survives him.
He lived with his family at 14 Colum
j bia Square. He was a member of many
lodges and was always held in the
highest esteem by those who knew him.

afternoon at 1:30 from the Masonic
; Temple. The interment will be held at
j Cypress Lawn Cemetery.
The following was issued by William
, Greer Harrison, president of the Olym
| pic Club:
IN MEMORIAM.
H*nry B. Russ haÂ« answered the laat cail
and sleeps with his fathers. No man In this
community has better stood the test of time
as applied to character than Henry B. Russ.
For some forty- four years he has been In the
eyes of the public; each succeeding year has
been as a testimony to his high character, hla
Intsirrlty and his sense of honor. For over
forty years he has been associated with the
I Olympic Club, filling all the posts of honor
connected with that institution: as prealdent,
, as secretary and aa treasurer he won and held
â¢ the affection and esteem of the entire dub.
He was familiarly and lovingly known In the
. club as the "watch doe of the treauury," a
I title in which he took especial dc-llght.
His domestic relations were delightful and
' to all the entertainments In the club where
ladies were admitted be Invariably brought his
family. His devotion to the club and Its best
! Interests was such aa to be rarely found In the
! person of any officer of any club. He loved
i the club and tite club loved him. His vacant
chair at the board will not be filled for many
a long day and we who knew him best and
i quite understood him will never cease until
i we are like him called to mourn his absence.

to go on the retired list by the ape
limitation of sixty-four years.
After that It is supposed and hoped
that the most Important post in the
army will go to some man who is not
so near the retiring age, and who can
hold it long enough to get settled in
the ways of administration.
Other change* of importance have
recently been decided upon. Brigadier
General Bliss, president of the Army
War College, will go to the Philippines,
where he has not yet served. His im
portant post here will be filled by Col
onel Arthur I. Wagner, who is consid
ered the foremost theorist of the army.
Colonel Samuel M. Mills, now com
manding the artillery district of Bos
ton, will become chief of artillery upon
the retirement in August next of Brig
adier General J. P. Story. Colonel
Mills will then have the rank of brig
adier general.
BROKEN SPINE
FAST MENDING
Electrical Lineman Recover
ing From a Rare and Deli
cate Surgical Operation
Special Dispatch to The Call.
GREAT BARRINGTON, Mass.,
March 19.â "I'm on the high road to re
covery," said H. Clyde Parrish, a
young electrician, to-day. "I've Just
succeeded in telegraphing to my toes."
Apparently In the- best of health, a
fine color in his face and his eyes clear
and bright, the young man whose back
was broken in four places last Septem
ber by a fall from a high electric-light
pole told of his gradual recovery one
of the great marvels of modern ttÂ»Â» m >mif.
While repairing a break on a line
Parrish came Into contact with a live
wire and fell a distance of thirty feet,
striking on his back. Surgeons found
there were fractures of the spine in the
region of the dorsal vertebrae, with a
pronounced downward dislocation. In
an Albany (N. V.) hospital the follow
ing day Drs. Vandeveer and McDon
ald, assisted by a German specialist,
found four of the dorsal vertebrae had
been dislocated and that paralysis pre
vailed in the entire body below the
waist line, due to the pressure of a
hemorrhage of the membrane of th,Â»
spinal column.
In removing the blood clot it was
necessary to saw through the four
broken bones, turn them aside, remove
the clot, return the bones to their
places and wire them together, a por
tion of each bone being cut away.
For six weeks Parrish lay immovable
on a pneumatic mattress. The opera
tion itself was one of the rarest and
most delicate known to modern surgi
cal science. After weeks in the hospi
tal Parrish was brought back to Great
Barrlngton, and on January 1 he ex
perienced the first sensation of feeling
below the waist line since the accident.
He has the strongest hope that he will
ultimately recover the use of his body
and limbs.

Cooper quickly fired three bullets Into
Dorsett, who died in a few minutes.
Cooper was at once placed in irons
and brought here, as the case is a civil
one, the Boston being at anchor.

tack him with a razor. After the first
quarrel Cooper took a revolver from
the room of an officer.

MYSTERIOUS GRAVE
ON A MOUNTAIN TOP
Spot in Colorado Visited Almost Dally
by Woman With Bunches of
Flowers.
TRINIDAD. Colo.. March 19.â A
strange story comes from Hastings, a
coal camp near Trinidad. A lonely
grave has been found on the summit of
the mountain near the town, and al
most daily a woman garbed in black
visits it bearing bunches of flowers. At
the head of the mound is a pine board
with a short verse of poetry written
on it.
No one has attempted to inquire into
the woman's secret. The appearance
of the grave indicates that it has been
there a long time. Only recently, how
ever, has the woman been noticed in
the vicinity, generally mounting the
trail on a horse.

HOSTESSES SAY
SOCIETY MUST
MEND MANNERS
ZOE GREEN RADCLIFFE
OAKLAND March 19. â Emerson says de
fect in manners Is usually the defect of fine
perceptions." Then must the men and women
I ' to-day be sadly lacking in fine perceptions.
Among other things, one hears hostesses com
plain every day of the neglect of guests to
tend acceptances or regrets. The unobtrusive
H. Â£. V. P. that formerly called for an Imme
diate reply receives absolutely- no attention In
nine cases out of ten. so one courageous Oak-
land woman recently Inclosed an extra card
on which wat engraved "An early reply will
oblige." That ought to bring desired results,
but It probably will not. Trie polite woman
would answer without such reminder and the
other kind will probably be highly insulted,be
cause she had to be told what to do. There are.
of court*, many who fin through Ignorance, for
knowledge of the polite usages of society does
not always come with the sudden riches that
sometimes opens the way into the circles of
the elect. â 
Whenever I see the letters R. 6. V. P. I
am always reminded of a etory I once heard:
Before the Civil war, when the South was in
the flush of its wealth and chivalry, one of the
largest estates in Kentucky was owned -by a.
worthy old gentleman who prided himself on
his gallantry, but who was ignorant of many
of the little customs of the cultured city set.
One day he received a letter, by courier, from
a friend recently returned from England versed
in the latest "correct things . " Down in one
corner of the envelope were the letters R. S.
V. P. The old gentleman was mightily pus
zled and it was some days before be found
any onÂ« who could enlighten him. ; When he
finally learned that the mysterious letters sim.
ply asked for a reply he was irate, because,
he said, no gentleman needed to be reminded
of hIE duty. An Immediate answer was dis
patched by a colored slave and the letter bore
the inscription, "S. B. A. N. When the
friend wrote back asking the meaning of the
hieroglyphics the old gentleman answered,
â¢' â SB* by a Nigger' of course."
Th* Sag at Ireland has waved triumphantly
over every social function of the past week.
St. Patrick's day gave the keynote to the vari
ous dinners, '-taÂ» and card parties, which do
not eeem to be any fewer â¢ because of 1-^nt
Â£verything is Quite formal, however, and it
is really thÂ« clubs that are keeping alive the
Metal spirit.
Last .Friday night it was Dr. and Mrs. E.
1* Dow's turn to entertain the Linda Vista
OJub asd, â¢as usual with this genial couple,
their eSorts were crowned with success. Their
artistic llttie home en the corner of Perry and
VemoÃ streets, was charmingly adorned by
the hostess' own nimble fingers, the living
room, where the card tables - were, being in
pick and green, while gorgeous red and yellow
blossoms brightened the entrance ball. The
dining-room, where the â  late" supper .was
served, was the most attractive of all. : Green
tune lay In filmy tangle on the table and each
green candle shade was fringed daintily with
shamrocks. Pretty little favors, dudeens tor
the men and green hatpins for the women,
were at each place. â  . . -
The four heavy silver forks that invariably
constitute the prizes given by the club were
won by E. M. Walsh. Mrs. Gilbert Belcher. Â»v;
A Hours and Mrs, E. T. Henshaw. Mrs Hen

was- the. musical given by Mrs. Olive' Reed
Oushman. Mrs. Cushman Is one of those who

STILL BATTLE
AGAINST SIN
Thousands Attend Last Ser
vices of the Great Re
vival Meetings in Oakland
CAMPAIGN SUCCESSFUL
After Two Weeks' Fighting
Good Fellowship Session
Will Conclude Its Work
OAKLAND, March 19.â The cam
paign affainst sin which for the < past
two weeks has been waged in Oakland
will go on, but the great revival meet
ings ended to-day.
Thousands of people crowded the
churches' to attend the last services of
the revival. Never before has this city
been so stirred with religious fervor,
and the great work of. the evangelists
has led hundreds to forsake the path
of vice. In every church in the city
were heard expressions of regret that
the work of 'Dr. Chapman and his as
sociates was ended, and many ex
pressed the hope that they might
again visit 'Oakland, where they hayÂ«
accomplished so much good.
The services began this morning with
decision day meetings in the Sunday
schools. These services were follpwed
at 11 o'clock by the regular morning
services In the churches, conducted by
the local pastors. Four great meetings
were held by the evangelists in the aft
ernoon.
One f of the most dramatic incidents
of the great campaign took place at one
of the evening meetings at the First
Congregational Church during one of
Dr. Chapman's services. A. man en
tered thÂ« church anS walked down the
aisle calling down curses upon the
evangelist and profaning the Christian
church. He was approached by J. L.
McComb, known as the "open-air
evangelist," who quietly led him from
the church to the chapel, and there
plead with the sinner to give up the
life he Was leading. The man was at
first obdurate, finally listened to the
words of the evangelist and at last,
overcome by the pleadings olj Mr. Mc-
Comb, burst into tears and begged that
he be forgiven for his actions.
The last meeting of the evangelists
will be held to-morrow morning at 10
o'clock. This will be a good-fellowship
meeting and with it will close Oak
land's great campaign.
CHURCHES MUST
AID NEW HOME
Archbishop Directs Pastors
to Donate Money Raised
in 1907 to Asylum Fund
During the year 1907 all the Catholio
churches in the archdiocese of San
Francisco will turn over every cent of
money they derive from church fairs
or entertainments to the fund of the
proposed new orphan asylum to be
erected under supervision of the Arch
bishop. This was the order read yes
terday from the altars of ail the
churches in the archdiocese.
The communication comes direct from
Archbishop Riordan and it was sent
at this early date so that the pastors
of the various churches might receive
the word in time and not plan to hold
any fairs, bazaars or entertainments
for the benefit of their respective
churches. The order will be lived up
to strictly to the letter.
This means that an immense amount
of money will be raised by the various
churches for the good cause. There are
fairs, bazaars and entertainments be
ing held almost daily In the different
churches of the archdiocese and when
the funds derived from these sources
during a whole year are turned over to
Archbishop Riordan, it can easily be
imagined what a handsome sum will
be realized.
In his communication, the Arch
bishop did not specify that the pastors
give entertainments for the benefit of
the new orphanage. He left this to
the discretion and generosity of his
subordinates. But it is expected that
as many if not more money raising
events will be held that the sum raay
be made as great as possible.
It has long been the desire of Arch
bishop Riordan to erect a great orphan
asylum that will be second to none in
the West. The undertaking will entail
an enormous outlay and the head of
the archdiocese has been figuring for
a long time on how the money could
be raised. The perplexing question
has not been entirely solved, but the
order which was yesterday issued will
do much toward starting the fund
and giving the Archbishop a handsome
amount for the worthy undertaking.

MEAL OF CLAMS
William C. Carey Partakes of
Bivalves and Dies After
an Hour of Terrible Agony
BROTHER ALSO SUFFERS
Drunken Debauch of Quartet
of Alamedans Ends in the
Sudden Demise of One Man
ALAMEDA, March 11â Excessive
drinking of alcoholic liquor^ and eating
of tainted clams are supposed to have
been the cause of the sudden death of
William C. Carey, who expired In
frightful agony this afternoon in the
shanty in which he lived on "Van Buren
and Mound streets. Carey was stricken
with excruciating stomach pains and
suffered for almost an hour before
death relieved him. His brother,
Thomas Carey, was taken with convul
sions about the same time, but the lat
ter's dangerous condition yielded to
treatment by Dr. Maurice W. Brown,
who was summoned to attend both
men. William C. Carey was dead when
the physician arrived.
With William Tully and Henry Ca
rey, their cousin, the Carey brothers
had been drinking and dissipating for
some time. When the supply of pro
visions in the Carey shanty ran short
the revelers obtained a quantity of
clams, which were; carelessly cooked
and partaken of by the men. Remains
of clams in a tainted condition were
found in the Carey house by Deputy
Coroner H. C. Gallagher. Dr. Brown
was unable to determine the cause of
Carey's demise and an autopsy and in
quest will be held. Carey was a natlv*
of Victoria, British Columbia, 82 years
old. He had resided here since boy
hood and had served various term* in
the City Prison and County Jail for
drunkenness and vagrancy.
NOBLE STATUES
ARE UNVEILED
The Most Rev. Archbishop
Performs Ceremony Before
a Devout Congregation
Bt. Mary's Cathedral was crowed
last night and a large part of the con
gregation was composed of the Knights
of Columbus and the Immaculate Con
ception Sodality. Archbishop Riordan
was present and performed the cere
mony of blessing and unveiling two
beautiful, pure while marble statues,
one of the Blessed Virgin on tha right
of the main altar and the other of Su
Joseph to the left.
Both statues were surrounded with
calla and Bermuda lillies and innum
erable lights. The Very Rev. Father
Prendergast, vicar general, was cele
brant at vespers and the Very Rev.
Father Charles Ranun and Rev. Father
J. W. Sullivan were the* deacons, the
attendants of honor with the Arch
bishop being the Rev. Father Cantwell
and Rev. Father O*Connell.
The music was rendered by St.
Mary's male choir and the Knights of
Columbus choir under the direction of
R. J. Harrison, the organist. The Rev.
Father Philip O'Ryan delivered the ser
mon, taking for his subject "Commun
ion of Saints."
Archbishop Riordan then blessed and
unveiled the statue of the Blessed Vir
gin, which was presented by the ladies
of the parish through the Immaculate
Conception Sodality, and followed by a
procession of priests and acolytes,
crossed to the altar on the north, where
he blessed and unveiled the statue of
St. Joseph.
His grace then delivered an address,
beginning by thanking the two organ
izations for the beautiful gifts. He said
that In some quarters it has been said
that Catholics divided their worship of
God and statues, and said ha thought
those who made such statements must
know better. In the walls of homes
they have pictures of friends, of
heroes, and of those near and dear to
them. Then why should they not have
in the church, in fresco, in statue and
in painting, the image of tha blessed
Lord and the Virgin Mary.
His grace said that Catholics be
lieved In having beautiful churches. It
was a sign of the Catholic heart to see
its church the most beautiful In tha
parish.
The Catholio church, said the Arch
bishop, was where the ever living
Savior dwelt, and should they not
place upon its altars the statues of
their saints, of their Lord and the Holy
Mother who gave Christ to them?
He spoke of the humble shattering of
Jesus, Joseph and Mary, and there la
that little family, he said, waa the en
tire church.
At the close of the service the big
congregation filed before the statues,
which are wonderfully beautiful. They
were chosen by Archbishop Riordan
when he was in the Bast.

SCANDAL OVER
ST. LOUIS FAIR
Irregularities Charged in
Connection With the Site
. and Sale of the Buildings
INNER CLIQUE ACCUSED
Assertion Again Made That
Awards Were Put Up for
a Price to the Exhibitors
Sptclsl Dispatch to ThÂ» CÂ«JI.
ST. LOUIS, March 19.â St. Louis is
[wondering if the storm of scandal is
j about to envelop the memory of the
Louisiana Purchase Exposition. It is
common gossip in the street that some
thing sensational is going to break in
the. near future. There is much gos
sip about the manner of making some
of the awards to the exhibitors. There
is much earnest questioning concern
ing the sale of exposition buildings and
other salvage.
! , St. Louis is anxious to know if For
â¢ esÂ£ Park, the site of the exposition, will
I be restored in the manner contenÂ»>lated
in the bond given by the exposition
[company as a guarantee to the city.
There is open talk that a so-called
world's fair clique, an inner circle in
exposition affairs, is making strenuous
effQrts to re-elect Mayor Kollo Wells,
â¢and that it has a selfish motive in so
doing.
. Then there is a more sensational re
port that Senator Carter has in his
possession some affidavits which, if
made public, would go far to confirm
the suspicions of questionable fair
management. It is said that during
the closing weeks of the exposition a
.man representing a brewery concern
turned over to D. R. Francis one or
more, affidavits that bronze medals
were being offered to exhibitors for a
consideration of $500, silver medals for
>1000, gold medals for $1500, and grand
prizes for $2000.

ley, a half-breed Indian, was shot by
his half-brother, Jesse Dermody, last
rlight at the Crab saloon on Cannibal
Island, in the Eel River, and died
twelve hours later. Neither man was
under the influence of liquor. They
disputed, over the change of a $5 gold
piece. Del"mody left the saloon and
v.ent to ' a cook house near. He was
followed half way by Hefffley, who was
said to have a knife. Dermody came
from the house with a shot gun and
shot his brother in the left side. Sev
eral â¢ hours later he went to Loleta,
three miles away, and surrendered
himself to Constable Bertsch. The
constable arrived in Eureka with his
prisoner this morning.

BUSINESS CONDITIONS STILL STABLE.
LAST week, like its three or four predecessors, exhibited few new
feature? in trade. There was the same atmosphere of confidence,
the same normal activity in general business, amd these practi
cally summarize the situation.
The foreign commerce, however, attracted some attention, as
both the exports and imports showed gains over the xnrespomling
nod last year. The export? at New York alone showed an in
crease of $1,750,000. and the imports one of $6,375,000. The bank
arinps of the country were $? per cent larger than in 1904. with
the most important cities except four in the West and South in
the column of gains. The clearings themselves amounted to $2,900,
000.000. of which New York was credited with $1,971,617,000. The
Ddoitt of business done by the City of New York in comparison
:h the rest of the country is surprising. Over half the co'iunerce
of the nation seems concentrated in that one little spot. The failures
Ifet week were 250, against 229 last year, and there were none
any serious importance. The railroad earnings for the first week
March showed an increase of 8.1 per cent, which is gratifying, as
fty have been lagging for some time.
As far as the staples go there is little or nothing to be said. The
edition of the cotton, woolen and iron and steel industries remains
sfactory, the mills being well employed, with labor troubles at
k minimum. 'Reports from all sections indicate a revival in building
operations, and these are supplemented by improving returns from
the different lumber districts. As no adverse returns are being re
ceived from the footwear factories of New England it is reasonable
to infer that conditions in this line are also satisfactory. In thiÂ«
connection firm and active markets for leather are mentioned, while
the feeling in hides is quoted steady. Provisions continue quiet, but
Chicago has quite recently been reporting an improvement in the
export demand.
Crop reports all along the line are excellent. None of the crops
are suffering from damaging conditions, and large yields of almost
all farm products are expected. The reports from the Pacific Coast,
where the season ha? thus far been ideal, are especially optimistic.
We have had rains, which to say the least have been copious, and
ihere have been no frosts severe enough to cut down the product of
fruit or cereals. There are large reserves of corn and oats in the
Kast, but wheat is more or leÂ«s short all over the country. The
Mocks of grain on the Pacific Coast have been so depleted by drafts
upon them for Oriental and Northwestern milling accounts that the
coast is now drawing corn and oats from the Eastern States. In
fact, the lion's share of the corn consumed in California for months
past has come from the East, as the State output, compared with its
requirements, is insignificant.
Affairs in Wall street have been rather more interesting of late.
The stock market has been very active during the past week, the
daily sales averaging over 1.000,000 shares, but the market has been
more or less unsettled, as it is felt that prices for most stocks are
w as high as they ought to be and the public are therefore
watching the market closely. Again, money has hardened some
what, and call money on several days went up to 4 per cent. A few
veeks ago the rate ranged in the neighborhood of I V* to 2 per cent,
d at one period even lower. The caution felt by investors and
speculators is shown by the fact that as soon as the money market
up a selling movement starts in and stocks go down. The New
York bankers report that all the prosperity in sight has been fully
and that stocks would now be on the down grade were
MR for the general satisfactory condition of business. At present
;he Government's expenses are exceeding its income, and the Treas
f Department ha? lately been calling in some of its deposits from
'he banks, which has tended to harden the money market. Loans
have been increasing of late, and there has been an expansion in them
$134,000,000 as compared with a year ago. It is expected thai
â  now on the demand for funds for April settlements will be a
strong factor in the money markets, hence most financiers are rather
anticipating higher rates for money during the next thirty days.
This i? causing no uneasiness, however, for the country is liberally
-ipplied with cash and the European money markets are also easy
â¢h abundant cash to draw on. Thus far no stringency has been
felt in any quarter, and in fact collections are reported better in
most parts of the country.
The above points summarize trade conditions throughout the
country. It will be seen that the showing on the whole is excellent.
AMERICA AND JAPAN.
JAPAN' It at war with Russia because the aggressions of the Czar
in Eastern Asia threatened the very existence of the Japanese
empire. The Tightness of Japan's position is recognized by
every government. She clearly had a cause for making public war,
and she has a clear right as against Russia to what she takes, if
any country were ever justified in self-defense Japan is justified.
But her success thus far has caused many attacks of semi-military
hysteria. The latest sufferer is Captain Hull, chairman of the Mili
ary Committee of the Hotase of Representatives, who sees visions
and dreams dreams about an immediate and bloody war between
the United States and Japan over the Philippines. Such an event
is about as likely as a war with Mars over the seventh satellite of
Jupiter. Our possession of the Philippines is no impairment of .:ny
of the national rights of Japan. It in no way interfere? with her
independence or her commerce. She never had any rights in our
islands, therefore we deprived her of none.
There is not a shadow erf pretext for a cause of war with her.
Such a war on her part would be for territorial aggrandizement. She
would have to assume toward us the exact attitude of Russia toward
her which provoked the present struggle. Japanese statesmen are too
?>tute and levelheaded to make such a blunder. Four years ago
Senator Lodge was talking about a speedy war with Germany. It
had no foundation and was mischievous. Captain Hull's talk about
a war with Japan is mischievous. The Mikado has all the war on
hand now that he wants, and though a final victory will probably
bring an indemnity from Russia that will recoup his treasury, noth
ing but lapse of time covering at least two generations can restore to
ihe population and human energy of Japan the lives that have been
After peace with Russia the policy of Japan will be long 1 peace
with the world, the extension of her influence in Korea, the holding
of Port Arthur and probably of Vladivostok and Saghalien. and the
of her proper influence upon the mainland of Eastern Asia.
THE WHEAT EXPERIMENTS.
T HE importance of finding ways to improve the quality of Cali
fornia wheat is fully recognized ; and now that reports come
that some 350 varieties have been planted at experiment stations
the Sacramento and San Joaquin valleys, it is only necessary to
point out that the good work being done by the Board of Trade and
the Agricultural Department of the State University should have
the public support it deserves. All those who are taking part in
the experiments under the generalship of the agricultural experts at
Berkeley should be stimulated to the most painstaking carrying out
all their instructions, to the end tha.t the conclusions which are
â  r to b? drawn from these tests may be as accurate as possible.
It would be beneficial both to the individual grain grower and to
the whole State if a number of planters conducted experiments on
ir own farms, made themselves watchful observers, wrote down
accurate records, and studied well thought out suggestions founded
these facts. They might thus, on the principle of "the multitude
greatly aid the efforts of those at the stations. They
* might send their reports to the Agricultural Department at Berkeley.
H these data might aid. if in no othef way, as corroborations of
â¢olvings otherwise reached, and the actions advised thereon. (

FORSAKES SMART SET
FOR RELIGION.
MRS. REUBEN JOHNSON.
nRS. REUBEN JOHNSON, by
many declared to be Maryland's
handsomest widow, has set so- j
Aety to wondering by suddenly
forsaking fashionable pursuits
and entering All Saints' Protestant
Episcopal Home as a 'visitor," says
the Baltimore correspondent of the
Philadelphia North American.
Mr?. Johnson has declared it her
intention to forsake the world and de
vote the remainder of her life to re
ligious work among the lowly.
She will "continue a "visitor" on pro
bation several months. The next grade
is that of "postulant," then "novice, "
and, lastly, professed sister. On tak
ing the vows of the last-named grade
she may not marry.
Mrs. Johnson will wear -the uni
form of the order, which is similar to
that of the deaconesses.
Mr*. Johnson, safe behind the walls
of the home, declines to see any one.
WOE TO PEANUT-EATERS
There is a new disease of the pea
nut, not as yet in Georgia, but In Ger
man East Africa, and such things
travel.
A. Karosek, in a letter to the Jour
nal Gartenflora, describes the new dis
ease. The peanut belongs to the most
important cultivated *plants there. It
suffers from fungup which causes
reddish-brown spots upon the plants,
which afterward change to black. The
disease occurs wherever peanuts grow,
but does not kill the plant 'elsewhere.
The new disease observed by Mr.
Karosek in the vicinity of Tanga re
sults in a rapid dying out of the plant.
It shows itself in a retarded growth
of the leaves, flowers and fruit, and
the leaves, in addition, show irregular
white spots, which ultimately change
to brown and black.
LOVE, HOPE, MEMORY

And they, too, shine to the song,
The evensong of the sisters three,

Mrs. White â Then why didn't you

Mr. White â Because it was just out

and only surmises as to the reason?
for her step are possible. It is said
that the breaking off of an engage
ment between herself and one of Bal

responsible for her move.
At the home the superior denies
that either romantic or sentimental
reasons have inspired Mrs. Johnson to
take the vows.
For the lafit three years Mrs. John

POLICEMAN'S RETORT
Commissioner Woodbury of the De
partment of Street Cleaning tells this
anecdote of a friend who was walking
through Central Park the other day.
Being in somewhat of a hurry, he
started to" cut across the grass at one
place, but was stopped by a park po
liceman, who remonstrated with him.
"What difference does it make?"
asked the New Yorker. "The grass is
half dead any way."
"Sure, an' what if it is?" responded
the Indignant guardian of the peace.
"Sure an' if yez had a sick friend
would yez be takin' a walk on his

quick-firers.' AH sorts of fireworks
seemed 'â 'â  to i help \ ) the work of their
searchlights. We made slow progress,
always on all fours. We reached the sec
ond netting of barbed wire, and this
we hacked ; away without very much
trouble. In ' ; front of us: was the fina'
fence. We had had a happy run of luck
so far. '. : We did riot wish to spoil it by
a touch of carelessness or too much
daring. ' Cautiously, therefore, we went
on our stomachs to make the distance
between the second and the first barbsd
wire entanglements. All this distance
was a surprise to us; it was covered
with many things evincive of the" skill
and thoughtfulne?F of the Russian en
gineers. It was about one hundred me-;
ters in length. : The ground '.was slop
ing. Â It was : filled with l pitfalls and
mines innumerable. For a second these
mines made us forget the first ' line of
wire fence toward which we were mak
ing our -way. First" of all, we, had to
dispose of the mines. We had reason
to siispecl that they wore electric
mines, and, in fact, the Russian engi
neers, with all their thoughtfulness,
did not always take the trouble to bury
the conductors.'; We discovered and cut
as many as four conductors, which
were just about the ; size of my thumb.
They were wrapped in a rubber ; coat
ing, and within the rubber coating we
found over twenty-four small wires. 1
carried no scissors about me. These
electric wires were a neat surprise :to
us. The severe ; usage to which it had
been I put " had : dulled the edge of my
ax almost as blunt as the edge of my
palm. It J could not cut the rubber
wrapped wires on soft earth. Time was
pressing. We were in danger of
discovered before we could get at the
first line of barbed-wire fence, which
was the last goal of our efforts; more
over, we were somewhat impatient. So
all of us fell upon those electric wires,
and with our teeth we bit them off. I
fear we may, have been somewhat ex
cited. We did some damage to our
teeth by, this work. When a man tells
you that he did not know when his
teeth were being broken, you 'would
not believe him. . That man might be
telling the truth, under some circum
stances, however."
He laughed a laugh innocent and
childlike, and in the laughter you could
see more than two broken teeth in his
mouth. Nothing else could drive home
the conviction quite so powerfully as
those broken teeth of his. â Adachi Kin

A FALLEN IDOL
Buffalo Bill,
We take it ill
That you. so nroud and haughty,
Have such a fad
For things so bad
And act so awful naughty.
Buffalo Bill,
You are a pill
And you are much to blame, sir.
You're raising Ned â
Go hide your head
And blush for very shame, sir.
Buffalo Bill.
You should keep still
And not stir up such trouble,
For fame is brief
And. to your grief.
'Twili burst just like a bubble.
Buffalo Bill.
We take it ill
That you should so unbridle
And take a jump
And, like a chump.
Become a fallen idol. '

DANGER IN LOVELESS
MARRIAGE.
DOROTHY FENIMORE
WHY should I not choose my wife as I would choose a business
partner with a practical sense of our suitability to each other
and of mutual benefit?" asks the man of 25. who wants a wife
and a home of hi. own. yet who has failed to find the "ons
â -* woman" whom, according: to sentimentalists, the world holds for
him if I meet a girl whose views of life are the same as mine, one who suits
me. and .slaved to take me as I am. why should I wait for that -thrill
called love?'' he arguesâ "why should'
I hot let reason guide me?" "a--;
* This is a common mood of "bache
lors" at 25.. Sometimes it IS the. result
of having loved; and loved, and loved
} again, with that fervor of boyhood that
has so much imagination in It that it
lif foredoomed to early, disillusionment.
Occasionally, it .is' a matter of mascu
line egotism which looks down on fem
ininity with as grand an air as a hill
top overshadowing a valley. Or It may
be \ sober incredulity about the worth
of any experience which the senses can
not comprehend. -
Since there are always girls who are
\ equally cynical through disappointment
in some early : love â who have
"got wise," as they say, in their fool
ishnessâmarriages which' are nothing
but matter-of-fact business arrange
ments occur among us, as in the old
world, but with the difference that
there is in them no element of parental
compulsion."'; .".-.'.'
-I cannot believe that such a marriage
as this -is a good marriage. . It is an
all-round . injustice, an injustice to. the
man, an injustice to the woman, and
an injustice to their children, to whom
are denied the blessed birthright of
love's ,; heritage. -A home cannot be
founded successfully on strictly busi
ness principles, any more than home
life can be regulated satisfactorily by |
business methods. _ â¢ '. '-,
There is more in life than getting and |
spending, and creature comforts and '
social prestige. There Is more in mar-1- â â ; I*
riage than cold respect, and common loyalty, and ordinary companionship*.
There: is more in parenthood than observance of duty, and natural affection
for offspring:.
There is love â a force indefinable, yet finer than fancy and braver than rea
son, and true as never-ending, faith. In every life love la a terrible
fact when it comes too late. It is a beautiful reality when you can
li ok up to it as a new reason for hoping and working, for believing In the
â¢things that are good and for enduring the things which are.
In tr- ordinary course of events marriage lasts a long, long time. The
majority of people get only one chance at it. And those who try it more than
once are generally regarded either with suspicion or with compassion. 9Â©
it is worth a man's while to use common sense in his selection of a life part
ner. He cannot afford to let his heart rule his head. But neither can he af
ford to leave his heart out of his calculations. For a loveless marriage Is ilk*
the old man of the seaâ a burden as heavy as it is hard to shake off.

PAYS DEPARTED
HIGH TRIBUTE
Rev. Rader Tells Hearers
That Mrs. Stanford Was a
Great American Woman
ALL GIVEN A CHANCE
Preacher Defends the Rich
Against Those Who Would
Question Their Generosity
"Mrs. Stanford â Her life work or
the gospel of making others happy,"
wag the theme of a sermon by the
Key. William Rader at the Third Con
gregational Church yesterday morn
ing. The pastor took for his text
Matthew xxvi, verse 13, which he ap
plied to the philanthropic work of the
late Mrs. Stanford. Mr. Rader said
in part:
In reply to his disciples who questioned the
purpose and Ihe "waste of precious ointment"
which was poured onto the head of the Sa
vior, Jesus said: "Verily 1 say unto yÂ»u,
wheresoever this gospel shall be preached in
the uhole world there shall also this, that
this woman hath done, be told for a memorial
of hor."
The text makes tender application to the
departed, to the one who passed away under
peculiar circumstances. Sh-r who by such
singular phllamhrophy, by noble deeds reared
a memorial not alone to herself but to her
dear departed, those who went before â her hus
band and her son. It seems to me th^t min
isters oi all churcheÃ and public institutions
should make reitrence to the career and the
philanthropy of Mrs. Stanford.
if â **â¢ believe in the higher life and woman
hood, then It were meet that th? name of
lhat noble woman go high In the list of the
greatest of philanthropists, whose benefactions
are only exceeded by Baron Hlrsh and Car
negie. Aa a woman, her name stands alone.
Let us not forget that through that good
woman's bountiful philanthropy both young
men and woni^n have been given a rare oppor
tunity. The gates of that great institution
have been thrown wide open that all may enter
and take from within the Knowledge they seek.
Of course, there are those who will criti
cize the rich; will question their g-lfta as the
pouring of the precious ointment on the head
of Jesus had been questioned as a waste. Car
neffii Is sprinkling the world with libraries,
sewing the seed of right civilization. >Â»t all
over the world will be heard the ques^n.
"Why not give that money to the poor?" as
If he were not already dolntr so. There Is ftrt
an institution raised In America but what that
*ame qmstlon is hrnujrht up and some, doubt
lcr?, apply It to Stanford University.
And what Is Stanford University? It is a
gift that even the poor can participate In as In
all such institutions In this land.
Mrs. Stanford will be rememÂ»*red as a bene
factor of the youth of California: she will be
remembered as a faithful wife and a loyal
mother; she will be remembered as a good
and BT^at American woman.
ALAMEDA MAN
AGAIN MISSING
William Tulloch, [Recently
31arried, Disappears for
Second Time in Ten Days
The whereabouts of William K. Tul
loch of Aiameda is again demanding
the attention of the police of this city
and San Jose and causing no end of
anxiety to his wife.
Two weeks ago yesterday Tulloch,
who is cashier for the publishing firm
of the Walter N. Brunt Company of
this, city, left his home in the forenoon,
after promising his wife that he would
return for dinner. Later she received
a telephone message from Fruitvale,
saying that he would not be able to
be home in the afternoon, owing to an
ongacremont h<,- had to keep in this city.
That was the last%he heard of her hus
band for a week, when he suddenly
turned up in San Jose and advised his
worried wife of nis proposed home
coming.
Inasmuch as Mrs. Tulloch is a bride
of only four weeks her anxiety over her
husband's strange disappearance was
naturally greatly relieved by the news
from San Jose, and rejoicing is said to
have followed her husband's return to
the family hearth. Yesterday, however,
gloom again pervaded the Tulloch
household, for the husband had made
a second disappearance.
Again the anxious wife appealed to
the police, who readily took up the
task of finding Tulloch. Up to a late
hour last night, however, a comparison
of notes between the detectives of Oak
land, San Francisco and San Jose re
vealed the fact that Tulloch was still
missing and hope of finding him before
to-day was abandoned.
The detectives are in accord with the
theory that Tulloch is not far from
San Jose, for while searching for clews
of him there yesterday they fell upon
a letter which he had written from the
St. James Hotel. It is therefore the
opinion of the police that a little pa
tience on the part of the lonely wife
will soon be rewarded by the recovery
of her wandering spouse. It was re
ported yesterday that Tuljoch's disap
pearance at this time will cause con
siderable inconvenience to the com
pany of which he is cashier, owing to
the fact that his presence at the firm's
office is necessary to transact dally
business, and for that reason the con
cern is exceedingly anxious that he
should be found as soon as possible.
Some naturalists say that swans are
never hatched except during; a thun
derstorm.

CELESTIALS RID
TOWN OF DEVIL
Sim Shee and Yung Wo So
cieties Join Hands in Ded
icating New Joss House
GAY CELESTIALS MARCH
Hundreds of Gorgeously At
tired Men Help Drive the
Evil Spirit Away Forever
Chinatown was decked in its *aia
day attire yesterday morning:, and
noise and excitement were rampant for
several hours while the members of the
Sim Shee Society were engaged in ded
icating their new Joss house and driv
ing the devil frc-m the sacred precincts
of the Oriental quarter. The streets
were thronged for several hours and
extra squads of policemen were needed
to handle the triumphant crowds.
The celebration was one of the most
gorgeous ever held in the Celestial
district. For more than two hours
hundreds of members of the Sim Shee
and Yung Wo societies paraded the
streets and in a fitting manner bade
the devil make a getaway forever.
The magnificent parade started from
the new clubrooms of the society, 1129
Stockton street. When the grand line
of march was formed the pageant
swung down Stockton street, and be
fore it ended every thoroughfare and
alley of Chinatown was visited, while
the multitude cheered and gave thanks
to Buddha.
Every Chinaman of consequence
walked solemnly behind an American
band that discoursed all kinds of mu
sic. There were Chinese musicians ga
lere, tomtom players, cymbal operators
and others who made hideous noises on
several weird looking devices. The dis
trict was in an uproar while the parade
lasted and citizens were attracted to
th^ scene from all parts of the city.
Thousands of dollars' worth of fire
works were exploded as the, marchers
solemnly wended their way along the
streets and through the alley ways.
The paraders sang tmd yelled till they
were sure the devil had betaken himself
to other climes. Tnen they went io the
Joss house, where the ceremonies of
dedication were enacted.
The exorcising began about noon and
lasted for several hours. The place
was ablaze with glory. Lights repre
senting all the colors of the rainbow
glistened brightly through the Oriental
ornaments, and the odor of the punk
and burning incense rose till it was
wafted ttf nearly every corner of the
Celestial quarter.
All the prominent members of the
two societies were called on for
speeches and they all responded, while
the onlookers and those who partici
pated in the festivities looked on and
chattered with a sense of satisfaction.
The high priests and other officials,
gowned in robes ablaze with all the
colors and splendors of the Orient, were
prominent in all parts of the house and
Joined in with the rest in chanting and
giving praise.
The ceremony was followed by a
sumptuc-us banquet, where more
speechmaking and glorification were in
order. The new Joss house is one of the
finest in Chinatown, and with it are as
sociated many of the most prosperous
and influential of the Celestial popula
tion.
BIGAMIST AT CITY PRISON
ON WAY TO SAN QUENTIN
' John S. McMurray, a Choirmaster,
Cftnvietetl on First Wife's Testi
mony, on Way to Jail.
John S. McMurray, who was found
guilty of bigamy and sentenced to
| serve four years in San Quentin, ar
| rived in this city last night from Pasa
! dena, where he was tried. McMurray
"will be detained at the City Prison un
, til this morning, when he will continue
! on hi 3 journey to the penitentiary. He
i was choir leader and organist in the
First Christian Church of Pasadena
for several years. Some years ago he
married a woman of this town. He
had a former wife living in Pennsyl
, vania, whom he had not seen for
, many years.
Three years ago McMurray went
J East to visit his legal wife and during
his stay there he fixed up her home.
His first wife, during his stay in the
East, got some intimation that he had
married again. She probed into the
case and found out it was true. She
had her husband arrested, and his
! tour to the penitentiary is the sequel.
THREE- YEAR-OLD GIRL.
FALLS INTO FIREPLACE
Neighbors Pnt Green Ink on Burns
and Bring on Blood
Poisoning.
REDDING, March 19.â The three
year-old daughter of Fred Webb of
Mlllville and niece of County Recorder
A. L. Webb, while playing near a fire
place this morning, during her moth
er's absence, fell into the fire. Her
hands and body were burned badly.
â¢Neighbors put green Ink on the burns
and caused blood poisoning. The child
is now In a serious condition.
A Woman's Brains.
The whole foreground of most wom
en's minds Is like a country store, full
and running over with drygoods and
groceries. If we could look into the
heart of this dear, common mother
brain we should see it platted out
something like this: Eight-tenths of
the area, John, the children, the house
work; three-twentieths, heaven: one
twentieth, all the rest of the world's '
affairs. It is the disproportionate .
space occupied by our separate affairs
that prevents our giving any sort of
proportionate attention to the world's
affairs, and we think it is right.â j

Japan's First Embassy.
wnen me nrsi embassy irom japan
arrived in Washington a member of
the Senate rose and said: "Mr. Presi
dent, the first embassadors from the
venerable country of Japan are about
to arrive. I move the jfeenatc do now
adjourn to meet and welcome the Jap- i
anese." Immediately another Senator
was on his feet, nor to second the mo
tion, but to "say sharply: "Mr. Presi
dent, I humbly trust the Senate of the
United States of America will not ad
journ for every show that comes
along."' That settled it.â New York

20,000 LJveu â for What?
â¢ We are in fact in the backwash of a j
most wanton, costly, inglorious war. In !
j which we have made ourselves a !
i laughing-stock and an opprobrium to ;
j the civilized world, disorganized our
! finances, our trade and our political in
: stitutions. And for what? Twenty
thousand British lives, two hundred
and twenty millions of sterling money
sunk in turning a fine land into a
howling wilderness, in making a chaos
lin South Africa, in ruining English
labor and handing over gangs of Chi
nese slaves to cosmopolitan gold-hunt

enough baseball to give any man's ball
team a good time.
Chicago was not there. That t^'lp
Â£he tale briefly. The men from ie
windy town could not hit, and when
the Seals began to sting a bit and the
ball commenced to roll lively, the big
leaguers i egan to do some booting that
broke up the game. Outside of the fa
tal fourth spasm Chicago played good
basebaU. but the Seals never contract
ed the rolMng- habit after that time.
JJmray Whalen and cute Georgle
Wheeler handled the slants so artisti
cally as to bewilder Chicago through
out "the struggle. Jimmy worked dur

hit him. "Wheeler strutted out in the

till all was over. Chicago piled up
four hits, but they all came in sepa

Nealon got in right with the multitude
by slamming a pretty single out to the

pushing a slippery one through first

There was a good sized crowd at
the Hawthorne Club's gymnasium
yesterday afternoon to see Young:
Dempsey, who hopes to capture the
feather-weight championship from
Johnny Crowe In their contest to-mor
row night at Woodward's Pavilion.
Dempsey created a good impression on
his visitors and showed plainly he is
in shape for his contest. Those who
have seen Dempsey In the ring think
he has an excellent chance to defeat
Crowe. The champion has worked
himself into good condition and he is
certain ha will defeat -Dempsey as
handily as he has his opponents in
other bouts.
Rough-house McDonald and Jack
McLaughlin will furnish part of the
main event. They will fight at catch
weights, which gives the Englishman
an fid vantage.
The special event, a battle between
Harry Tenny and Johnny Murray, will
be fought at 115 pounds. Four other
matches will complete the programme.
The Wlsbech Cemetery Company is
unable to pay a dividend this year,
"owing to the lower death rate in the
town." Wish** is an English town of

SHIP'S CARGO SHITTED
IN RECORD TIME
Liner Ronlg Albert Discharged One
and Took Another Cargo In
Twenty-Nine Hours,
That the port of New York has ex
ceptional facilities for the handling of
cargoes was illustrated the other day
when the Konig Albert of the North
German Lloyd line sailed on schedule
time for Mediterranean ports, having
discharged one large cargo, taken on
another and coaled in less than twen
ty-nine hours.
When it was found that the vessel
would be considerably overdue on her
last westward trip arrangements wÂ»r<*
made by the management of the lino
with the health and customs officials
to bring her up to her dock, no mat
ter how late in the night she should
reach quarantine. It was about 10
o'clock Thursday night when she left
quarantine and It was fully 11 when
the vessel docked.
Longshoremen began the work of
unloading Just as soon as the passen
gers were off the ship. Through
Thur*" 3 night, all day Friday and
Friday night they toiled like beavers,
every derrick on the ship being
pressed into service and by 4 o'clock
Saturday morning not only had a
huge cargo been discharged, but an
other, about 5000 tons of miscellane
ous freight, had been put aboard.
"This is onÂ« of our most popular
spring styles," said the shoe merchant.
"It has what we call the flat sole ef
fect."
But young Spoonmore, who had ex
perienced the flat sole effect so often
when he was going 1 to Â»cc Banker
Means' daughter, said he thought he
would prefer some other kind. â Chi

ALASKA TRAVEL
MAY BE STOPPED
Unusually Warm Weather
3lelts Snow and Ice and
Breaks I p Dawson Trail
6peclal Dispatch to Th* Call.
TACOMA. March 19. â Travel over ice
and snow from White Horse to Daw
son may be stopped any day through
the breaking up of the winter trail.
Continued warm weather in that region
is the cause.
Telegrams from White Horse to the
White Pass Railroad say that the snow
Is already thawing fast, leaving many
bare spots on the trail. Freight and
passenger stages can now carry only
light loads. The ice is thinner than
usual and the th,aw, if continued, will
put the trail out of business. It is not
certain that the passengers for the in
terior now leaving the Sound can get
through before navigation opens.
The season has been very mild
throughout the Yukon country. There
are signs of an early flow of water In
the Klondike creeks. It is probable that
sluicing will begin before March ends.
CARTHUSIAN MONKS WIN
CHARTREUSE INJUNCTION
Ecclesiastics Obtain Order Against
Sale of Spurious Goods Under
Confiscated Labels.
An injunction was granted by Justice
Lacombe in the United Stats* Circuit
Court recently against the salÂ« in this
country of chartreuse liqueur put up in
the bottles, and with the labels of the
Carthusian monks of La Grande Char
treuse, In France. When the French
Government, by the passing of the as
sociation's act, forced the monks of La.
Grande Chartreuse to seek an asylum
in Spain, it appropriated the labels and
trademarks of the Chartreuse liqueur,
granting the use of them -to a firm of
French distillers.
The monks, through thslr agents in

The New Woman In Japan.
The new woman, it is said, has
reached Japan, and "the little woman,
garbed in gay kimonas. are being in
fluenced by the strenuous spirit of
Westernism creeping in. and are go
ing to clubs, plunging into modern
movements for the welfare of every
body, except their own families," or,
so at least says Dr. Jamel Kin. a lady
of far Cathay, who has been lectur
ing in Buffalo. The fact, moreover,
that a Chinese woman has taken the
platform in America to tell of what
American women are doing in Japan
shows that the Orient knows how to
revenge itself for the Westernism that
is now disturbing what used to bÂ«
called "the. unchanging Bast." â New

The moon was shining brightly on
Union Coursing Park last night when
Quita and Richard Anton met in the
deciding course of the class stake.
The fine weather and a good card
served to attract -the , largest attend â Â»
aace seen' at* a coursing meeting dur
ing the past two years. The storm- of
the morning possibly had an effect
on the hares as they proved an un
even lot. Some ran until It was found
necessary to call out the relief dog.
while others provided only short
trials. Â»
The dogs in the final of th* class
stake ran up the field neck and neck.
Quit* was credited with the speed
of the pair and with four turns, Rich
ard .Anton killing the hare.
Owing to the withdrawal of Happy
Lad in the semi-final round of the re
serve stake. Gold Chain won the event
by default.
The talent was off in its judgment
in a number of trials in which th*
favorites were beaten on their merits.
The biggest upset of the day was th*
defeat of Rocker Arm, the 1 to 7

GREATEST EVER KNOWN
Philanthropist Says 100.000 Men \nÂ»
Tnemployed and 50.000 Children
Go to School Hungry.
Go to School Hungry.
Commissioner General Sargent of the
Bureau of Immigration has received a
letter from a prominent New York
philanthropist, whose name he cannot
disclose, in which a startling portrayal
of the poverty in the metropolis is
given.
The- letter says New York's propor
tion of the unemployed is the largest
in the country, that 100,000 idle men arÂ«
In the city now, or 40 per cent mort
than last year.
"Fifty thousand children go to school
breakfastless, which means Idle fa
thers.'" the letter declares. "So over
whelmed is the Department of Chari
ties with tens of thousands of appli
cations from men out of work that it
finds itself unable to cope with th* sit
uation. In short, the metropolis this
winter is facing a problem with re
gard to the unemployed such as has
never been known In years past.
"The cause of this state of affairs is
of less moment now than the imme
diate problem of how to deal with thÂ»
multitudes of the unemployed. Nor
has the question here to do wtth ulti
mate relief, such as Congress can pro
vide by restricting immigration and
scattering immigrants.
"The immediate question then Is:
What can be done with the gr p *t army
of unemployed at once? This question
eliminates the unwilling and th* un
able, whom we always have with us,
giving only the able and wUltn*â the
honest tdle â mostly unskilled labor, of
course. How are we to give practical
relief to these V
Mr. Sargent considers the letter
strong evidence that his plans for
breaking up the alien colonies In the
large cities should be carried out. â

Doctrine of Chance.
In Chief Justice Marshall's time the
Supreme Court of the United States
lived apart from the rest of the world
and dined together at a sort of mew.
only once a year dining in public at
the White House. Justice Story wu
once rallied on this aloofness and ex
plained It drolly:
"The fact is we Jnadee* take no part
In the society of the place. WÂ« d*ne
once a year with thÂ« President, and
that is all. On other days we dlnÂ« to
gether and discuss at table the ques
tions that are argued before us. We
are great ascetics and even deny our
selves wine, except In wet weather."
Here the Justice paused, as if think -
Ink this last statement placed too great
a tax on human credulity, and then he
added slyly:
"What I say about wine. sir. gives
you our rule, but it does sometimes
happen that the Chief Justice will say
to me when the cloth is removed:
Brother Story, step to the window and
see if it does not look like rain.' And
If I tell him that the sun is shining.
Chief Justice Marshall will sometimes
reply: 'All the better, for our Jurisdic
tion extends over so large a territory
that the doctrine of chances makes it
certain that it mxtmt be rainin* som*

PROUD RUSSIAN
ENDS HIS LIFE
Troubles by Jlisfortunes,
Sergius Lusky Sends a
Bullet Into His Brain
Believing that he had passed the age
of usefulness and being despondent
over misfortunes, Sergius Lusky, a
former officer in the Russian army, and
later director of the national college of
Salvador, killed himself Saturday even
ing by sending a bullet into his brain.
The scene of Lusky' s death was his
home at 327 OTarreil street, where the
members of his family were gathered
about the dining table, partaking of
their evening meal, when the shot was
fired. Mrs. Lusky, hearing the report
of the pistol, but supposing that the
explosion occurred elsewhere, immedi
ately went to her bedroom, where her
husband had been lying an invalid for
several days, to see whether the noise
had aroused him.
The sickroom was dark, and going
quietly to the bed the affectionate wife
gently placed her hand upon her hus
uand's iorehead. He did not move, and
feeling a moisture upon his face, she
left hie side, believing that he had
dropptd off into a peaceful slumber.
When she reached the dining room,
however, she was startled by the dis
covery that the supposed perspiration
she had wiped from the sick man's face
v. as blood. Hurrying oack into the sick
room, the distracted woman turned up
the light, which shed its rays upon a
horrifying sight. With a revolver
tightly clutched in his right hand,
which lay uiÂ»on his breast, tne invalid
was silent in death. He had placed
the end of tht weapon in his mouth
and pulled the trigger, dying instantly.
Lusky had been sick for some time,
and had apparently made his plans for
death a day before he carried them out.
Under the riretonse of going to mail a
letter to a daughter in Guatemala, he
left hie rooms lor half an hour on Fri
day, and while absent he doubtless
bought the pistol. Returning to his
room he placed the weapon under his
pillow. When his wife proceeded to
rearrange the bedclothes her husband
protested, on the ground that it an
noyed him. It is prboable that this ex
cuse was made to prevent Mrs. rLusky
from discovering the presence of the
weapon.
Lusky was a native of Russia, where
he formerly served In the army, and
was a lawyer by profession. Coming to
this continent eight years ago he went
to Salvador, where he became the di
rector of the national college. Later he
journeyed to Honduras, where he en
tered the customs service and was
finally deputized to represent the re
public at the Buffalo exposition. Ar
riving here some time ago his
family, Lusky became despondent over
the fact that he was unable to follow
his profession successfully or obtain
remunerative employment, a fact
which he attributed to his advance in
years.
Two months ago a scratch on his
j right hand resulted in blood poisoning
and he was finally sent to a local hos
pital by Dr. Calderon, where he was
successfully treated. Recently he re
: turned to his home on O'Farrell street.
I Several nights ago Dr. Calderon re
1 ceived a summons from his patient and
. going to his home was surprised to find
I that Lusky 's leg was badly swollen.
j The patient finally confessed that pain 3
' in his arm had prompted him to use
morphine, which he had injected into
j his leg with a rusty needle, blood
I poisoning following.
Rt-ailzing that he would again have
:to go to the hospital, and brooding
j over the fact that he had no funds no
j doubt caused him to end his life. He
j was 50 years of age and is survived by
' a widow and six children. He was a
! schoolmate of the local Russian Consul.
I Just before the outbreak of the Japan
| ese- Russian war Lusky, with the as
sistance of the Consul, was planning to
obtain the local management of a Rus
sian bank, which his government was
about to establish here, but the project
was abandoned when the hostilities
began.
BREAK WINDOW IN GLOVEHOUSE.â
A window In the glovehouse on the corner of
Market and O'Farrell streets was broken early
yesterday morning by two men. Harry Wanks
41 Stockton street, saw them and he told
Policemen Pearl and Connor, who arrested
Thoma6 Jackson at O' Fan-ell and Stockton
street* and Daniel O'Meara at Third and Mis
sion streets. They were identified by Wanks
and were booked for an attempt to commit
burglary.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, MARCH 20. 1905.
ELECTRIC BOOTBLACK
WORKS AS YOU SPIN
Patent Shoe Polisher Operates
Like Mernj-Go-Round.
SOME OF THE EXTRAORDINARY PO.S3IBII..ITIKS OF THE INVENTION FOR
SHINING SHOES BY MEANS OF THE ELECTRIC BRUSH AND REVOLVING
CHAIRS DEPICTED FROM A CARTOONIST'S POINT OF VIEW.
You don't have your shoes shined or
shone any more; you have them elec
trocuted. The Zimmerman patented,
revolving, rotary, electric bootblack
machine is In town. It takes six pairs
of tootsies, restores to them the ebon
blush of youth and takes the owners on
a voyage round the shop at the same
time.
Just sit on a seat with five others
whose footgear is ready for the electric
chair. The head executioner turns a
lever and the rotary shiner rotates.
The rotary brushes gyrate around the
boot, pass It on to the next burnisher,
then it goes through a revolving rag
bag and comes out looking like patent
leather in its palmy days.
They have one of the machines out
near the City Hall now. It Is being
manipulated by Robert J. Craig. They
put a pair of shoes up against it yes
terday that were overdue for Dr. Osier
and tt^ chloroform. They looked like
a cross between a weather-beaten
headstone and the last Russian fleet.
One of the shoes had been ambling
along through the San Joaquin Valley
during the fruit season, the other had
been tossed on the murky waters of the
bay on the tarry foot of a departed
hay scow mariner. But even this foot
gear didn't phase the automatic pol
isher. Their weary wearer tucked up
his frayed trousers and the machine
went round and round. "When it
stopppd the hobo saw his own reflec
tion in his shoes. He cut out a ->lece
of one of the toes to use as a mirror.
Craig explained the miracle:
"We nrst use one paste that fills in
the cracks in the leather, same as a
dentist fills teeth. That goes in on the
first round. On the second we do some
tall rubbing."
A gathering of bootblacks who in
sisted in putting the shoes through the
t-tunt went away looking mournful.
"Pretty soon they fixa da machine so
droppa da nick. Then Joe and me to
da woods."
The inventor contemplates the build
ing of more machines with improve
ments. One will be a merry-go-round
with shoe-polishing attachments that
will make the little tootsies look new,
while an electric piano plays "The Good
Old Summer Time."
Another will be a circular machine
on a large scale that will whirl past the
bargain counters in the big department
stores. While the brushes get busy
with the Oxford kids the fair shoppers
can grab for the marked down.
The contrivances may be instituted
In refreshment booths. An extra rotary
motion will be given to the seats of
these, in order that the average cock
tail can slide down easily.
To the Members of the Olympic Club
Gentlemen: Individually and as mem
bers you are invited and requested to at
tend the funeral of our late treasurer
and dearly beloved fellow member .

BRISTOW HERE
ON A MISSION
Comes to Learn Views of
Pacific Coast People Re
garding Policy for Canal
John L. Bristow, formerly fourth
Assistant Postmaster General, who
was recently appointed by President
Roosevelt a special commissioner of
the United States to investigate the
trade conditions and freight rates be
tween the Atlantic and Pacific Coasts
and across the Isthmus of Panama, ar
rived here yesterday from the south
and is staying at the St. Francis
Hotel.
He entered upon hiÃ duties a little
over a month ago, going direct from
Washington to Colon, which he reached
on February 14, and after a ten days'
stay on the isthmus he started up the
coast, visiting various Central Ameri
can and Mexican fc>Â°rts en route to this
city. Referring to his trip last evening
Commissioner Bristow t said:
I do not feel at liberty at this particular
time to publicly discuss the results of my In
vestigation, so far as Jt has proceeded. I am
here for the purpose of gaining such informa
tion as I can regarding the Interests of the
people of this coast, ao far as they are affected
by the Panama route transportation, and also
as to what they think should be the Govern
ment's future policy in directing the affairs
of the canal. It is yet uncertain how long I
shall remain in San Francisco, but I suppose
It will be several days. From this city Igo to
Seattle and- then eastward, later visiting- New
Orleans and other Southern commorical centers.
On his way up the coast Commis
sioner Bristow visited Puenta Arenas.
Corinto, Acajulta, San Jose de Guate
mala, Ghamperico and finally reached
Salina Cruz on March 5. He spent
several days on the Isthmus of Te
huantepec inspecting the national rail
road and port works, then proceeded
on to the City of Mexico, leaving there
for Los Angeles, which he reached two
days ago. The Commissioner is ac
companied by his secretary. J. T. Wat
son, who is aiding him in gathering
together valuable data that will
eventually be Incorporated In a report
to President Roosevelt.

NEAR TO DEATH
IN THE ARCTIC
Fred Martin, a Fisherman,
Faces Hunger and Bit
ter Cold for Four Days
FLESH TOBN FEOM HIM
Barefooted He Scales High
Precipice and Staggers
Across the Ice to Safety
A tale as vivid as any of London's
stories of the frozen north is brought
back by Fred Martin, agent for the
Union Fishing Company, who arrived
on the Czarina yesterday.
For three days and nights he lay in
the shelter of a frail dory on a patch
of frozen beach. Behind him an icy
precipice reared, before him a raging
surf beat, and at high tide threatened
to sweep him out into the ocean. All
this time the cold was intense and bit
into the marrow of his bones.
On the third evening, spurred on by
the desperation that stirs a man who
faces certain death, he scaled the slip
pery precipice. How he did it he
scarcely knows now-. He ascended
twenty feet by lassoing a jutting rock
in the wall with the pointer of his dory
and drew himself up.
During the remainder of the ascent
he was blinded and delirious. The,
shoes were torn from his feet by jagged
rocks, his hands were lacerated, but he
continued to climb. Nails were
wrenched from his fingers and toes, his
mind was a blank, but the blind in
tinct of self-preservation moved him
somehow toward safety.
Finally, with his limbs numbed and
frozen, he reached the top. It took him
Fix hours. By that time he was a mass
of lacerations from head to foot and
almost a maniac. A wild snowstorm
was blowing, but he plunged into it
and made his way against it.
The shoes had been torn froâ¢ his
feet and his clothing was in rags. Bits
of sleet cut into his unpiptected flesh
like the points of sharp knives, and the
ice under him wore his feet, but he
staggered on.
HIS BODY GROWS NUMB.
Finally his entire body became numb.
He wanted to lie down' and sleep. Just
enough consciousness. remained in him
to warn him that the sleep would be
his last. So he struggled on through
the white silence.
Night fell upon him and h,e could
scarcely drag his leaden feet. Suddenly
he stumbled and rolled downward. He
thought that he had fallen into a cre

vasse and that this was the end. The \
desperate fight had been in vain, he !
felt, and he lost consciousness entirely.
But Martin had rolled down almost
into his own camp at Eagle Harbor.
Men from that fishing station found
him when they had given him up for
dead.
They bore him to a cabin, but seeing
that his feet and limbs were frozen i
they stripped him and buried him In ,
the snow for a while. For seventeen I
days Martin lay between life add
death, but finally his robust constltm
tfon pulled him through.
On April 10 of last year Martin left
Eagle Harbor, a little fishing station I
on Noyali Island, eff the Alaska :
Peninsula. He was alone In a small i
dory. The morning was calm when he j
started, so he pulled out several miles
and set his lines for cod.
Toward noon a storm came up. Al
most before Martin could haul in his
lines the wind was blowing a hurricane.
The little boat was whirled UDon a !
1 little strip of beach and somehow
Martin managed to make it fast.
HEMMED IX BY BREAKERS.
For three days and nights the storm
raged. Martin hauled the dory ud
against the cliff and. piling rocks over
it, used it as a shelter. At hisrh tide
the breakers dashed against the cliff
and threatened to seize the dory and j
its owner. ,
All this time Martin was drenched
by the icy Arctic waters. Hunger
gnawed at his vitals with ever in- J
creasing pangs. Sometimes when a |
feverish thirst assailed him he would \
dig a piece of ice from the walls, but ,
there was scarcely enough warmth in |
his body to melt it. The ice froze to
his lips and when he tried to draw It
away skin and flesh came with It.
"When Martin was found by the fish
ermen of Eagle Harbor he hardly
looked like a human being. Parts of
his body were raw, his flncers were |
j bleeding stumps, and his feet were |
j worn and lacerated to the bone. He
had lost forty pounds.
When seen on the Czarina yesterday,
' Martin seemed to have recovered from
his terrible experience. His nails had
1 grown apain and he had recovered his
lost weight.
"I think I owe my escape to the fact
that I have always taken care of my
self," he said. "I have never touched
liquor. I guess If I had been a man
who dissipated my bones would bÂ«
lying up north now."
Martin lives at 547 Stevenson street
in this city. He Is 43 years of ajre and.
despite the terrible experience he has
undergone, still looks like a man who
could face any hardship.
