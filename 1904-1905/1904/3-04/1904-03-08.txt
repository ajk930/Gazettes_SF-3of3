any danger to Roberts Island or the
large holdings of the Rindge Company

Vladivostok is known to be better

are expressed as to the character of

there for forty years andit is conse

somewhat obsolete character. It is

years all .the available new guns and

to send on the single line of the Trans-

LONDON, March 8. âUp to a late
hour last night the Japanese legation
here had received no official informa
tion regarding the bombardment of
Vladivostok. It is believed at the le
gation, however, . that : the Japanese are
now between the. Russian -cruiser
squadron and Vladivostok, and there
is reason to .believe that the Russian
squadron is in the vicinity of Possiet
Ba>\ Russian ; official dispatches do
not mention this squadron; and this
fact; lends color to ' the belief that the
Japanese ".warships, have shut it out of
Vladivostok. It ' is pointed out ' at the
legation that if this is true the Russian
vessels are in a critical condition; since
thVy must run the gauntlet of the Jap
anese squadron off Vladivostok or the
Japanese .squadron off Port Arthur
before 'reaching, a Russian port -Â¦Â¦;': "

SEATTLE. March 7. â Fire on board
the British ship Simla at Port Blake
ley this morning damaged the vessel
and Its equipment to the extent of $20,
000. But for the fact that Fire Chief
Ralph Cook of Seattle dispatched the
flreboat Snoqualmie to fight the flames,
it is very likely several other ships
loading at that port would have been
destroyed.
From statements made by members
of the crew, It is believed that the fire
originated in the sail locker. After de
stroying new canvas valued at about
$5000, the flames spread forward of the
foremast to the stem. The vessel Is
burned a distance of about forty feet.

H. W. Goetze, a Weaverville butcher,
wanted to visit a slaughter-house this
morning. He thought that in the ab
sence of bridges he could ford the
stream. The water washed his horses
and wagon to an island, where the in
trepid butcher was later rescued.
A. W. Fetzer fell into the raging
creek to-day and was carried a hun
dred feet, when he caught hold of a
tree, to, which he hung until rescued.
The stage to Deadwood from Weaver
ville started to ford the creek. John
Daniels, a passenger, took fright and
leaped into the stream. He managed
to swim ashore, although handicapped
by an overcoat and boots in addition
to an ordinary amount of clothing.
REDDING, March 7.â East Weaver
Creek, which skirts the town of Weav
erville, the county seat of Trinity Coun
ty, is running wi!d as a result of con
tinued rains. Weaverville has been
isolated by the carrying away of two
bridges that spanned the stream at the
upper and lower end of the town. Peo
ple there say over the telephone this
evening that they must commence con
structing a temporary bridge in the
morning. In order to secure a means of
travefknd communication with the out
side world.
Fearing an attempt by the police to
rescue him the rioters formed a nollow
square. Some one knocked the nejjro
tc; the ground and those near him fell
back five feet. Nine shots were fired
into his prostrate body and satisfied
that he was dead a dozen men grabbed
the body and with a triumphant cheer
the mob surged into Columbia street
and marched to Fountain avenue, one
of the principal thoroughfares of the
town. From there they marched south
to the intersection of Main street and
a rope was tied around Dixon's neck.
Seeing that further resistance was
useless and the injury of innocent per
sons useless the authorities consented
to the demand of the mob for the right
man. *He was dragged from his cell to
the jail door and thence down the stone
Eteps to the jail yard. 7
MEX CARRY VICTIM.
All this time a party with a heavy
railroad Iron was beating at the east
door, which yielded to the battering
ram as did the inner lattice doors. The
mob then surged through the east door,
overpowering the Sheriff, turnkey and
a handful of deputies, and began the
assault on the iron turnstile to the
cells.
The police from the south door were
called inside to help keep the mob from
the cells and in five minutes the south
door had shared the fate of the east
one.
At 10:45 the police said there was
nothing more to fear and they with
other officials and newspaper men
passed freely in and out of the jail.
Shortly before 11 o'clock a diversion
Â¦was mafie, a small crowd moving
around to the south entrance. The po
lice followed and a bluff was made at
Jo6tllng them off the steps leading up to
the south entrance. The crowd at this
point kept growing, while yells of
"Hold the police," "Smash the door,"
"Lynch the nigger" were made, inter
spersed with revolver shots. ' >; r
SCHE3IE OF A MOB.
Collins was shot by IMxon Sunday
morning while the latter was in his
room in a hotel here removing his
baggage. He had decided to quit the
place and, fearing trouble with Anna
Corbln, a woman with whom he was
acquainted. Dixon asked Collins to go
to the hotel with him. While in his
room Dixon and Miss Corbln quarreled
and Dixon is said to have shot her in
the breast. The policeman then at
tempted to arrest Dixon, when the lat
ter, fired into the officer's body, inflict
ing fatal wounds.
At 10:20 the mob melted away rapidly
and it was the general opinion that no
more attempts would be made to force
an entrance.
SPRINGFIELD. Ohio, March 7.â A
rnob of 800 men gathered at the County
Jail to-night witii the avowed purpose
of lynching Richard Dixon of Cyn
thiana, Ky., a negro, who shot Police
man Charles Collins yesterday.
At 8:31 Sheriff Floyd Routzahan ap
peared on the jail steps and pleaded
with the mob to disperse, but he could
be heard with difficulty. His appeal
was ineffectual* and he was compelled
to go within.
At 11 o'clock Dixon was taken from
the Jail and shot to death in the jail
yard and the body was taken from
there to the corner of Main street and
Fountain avenue and hung high to a
telegraph pole, where the mob spent
the next half-hour riddling the body
with bullets from several hundred re
volvers. The mob forced an entrance
to the Jail by butting in the east doors
with a railroad Iron.

No word confirming this story has been received in any other quarter, except a dispatch from Yihkow, received during the day, which reported that the bombardment had been
renewed, but giving no details. Jldmiral Jllexieff reports a return of the Japanese squadron to Vladivostok, but does not mention a new attack.

SEATTLE. March 7. â Fire on board
the British ship Simla at Port Blake
ley this morning damaged the vessel
and Its equipment to the extent of $20,

Ralph Cook of Seattle dispatched the

it is very likely several other ships

originated in the sail locker. After de

$5000, the flames spread forward of the

H. W. Goetze, a Weaverville butcher,
wanted to visit a slaughter-house this
morning. He thought that in the ab
sence of bridges he could ford the
stream. The water washed his horses
and wagon to an island, where the in
trepid butcher was later rescued.
A. W. Fetzer fell into the raging
creek to-day and was carried a hun
dred feet, when he caught hold of a
tree, to, which he hung until rescued.
The stage to Deadwood from Weaver
ville started to ford the creek. John
Daniels, a passenger, took fright and
leaped into the stream. He managed
to swim ashore, although handicapped
by an overcoat and boots in addition
to an ordinary amount of clothing.
REDDING, March 7.â East Weaver
Creek, which skirts the town of Weav
erville, the county seat of Trinity Coun
ty, is running wi!d as a result of con
tinued rains. Weaverville has been
isolated by the carrying away of two
bridges that spanned the stream at the
upper and lower end of the town. Peo
ple there say over the telephone this
evening that they must commence con
structing a temporary bridge in the
morning. In order to secure a means of
travefknd communication with the out
side world.
Fearing an attempt by the police to
rescue him the rioters formed a nollow
square. Some one knocked the nejjro
tc; the ground and those near him fell
back five feet. Nine shots were fired
into his prostrate body and satisfied
that he was dead a dozen men grabbed
the body and with a triumphant cheer
the mob surged into Columbia street
and marched to Fountain avenue, one
of the principal thoroughfares of the
town. From there they marched south
to the intersection of Main street and
a rope was tied around Dixon's neck.
Seeing that further resistance was
useless and the injury of innocent per
sons useless the authorities consented
to the demand of the mob for the right
man. *He was dragged from his cell to
the jail door and thence down the stone
Eteps to the jail yard. 7
MEX CARRY VICTIM.
All this time a party with a heavy
railroad Iron was beating at the east
door, which yielded to the battering
ram as did the inner lattice doors. The
mob then surged through the east door,
overpowering the Sheriff, turnkey and
a handful of deputies, and began the
assault on the iron turnstile to the
cells.
The police from the south door were
called inside to help keep the mob from
the cells and in five minutes the south
door had shared the fate of the east
one.
At 10:45 the police said there was
nothing more to fear and they with
other officials and newspaper men
passed freely in and out of the jail.
Shortly before 11 o'clock a diversion
Â¦was mafie, a small crowd moving
around to the south entrance. The po
lice followed and a bluff was made at
Jo6tllng them off the steps leading up to
the south entrance. The crowd at this
point kept growing, while yells of
"Hold the police," "Smash the door,"
"Lynch the nigger" were made, inter
spersed with revolver shots. ' >; r

Collins was shot by IMxon Sunday
morning while the latter was in his
room in a hotel here removing his
baggage. He had decided to quit the
place and, fearing trouble with Anna
Corbln, a woman with whom he was
acquainted. Dixon asked Collins to go
to the hotel with him. While in his
room Dixon and Miss Corbln quarreled
and Dixon is said to have shot her in
the breast. The policeman then at
tempted to arrest Dixon, when the lat
ter, fired into the officer's body, inflict
ing fatal wounds.
At 10:20 the mob melted away rapidly
and it was the general opinion that no
more attempts would be made to force
an entrance.
SPRINGFIELD. Ohio, March 7.â A
rnob of 800 men gathered at the County
Jail to-night witii the avowed purpose
of lynching Richard Dixon of Cyn

man Charles Collins yesterday.
At 8:31 Sheriff Floyd Routzahan ap
peared on the jail steps and pleaded
with the mob to disperse, but he could
be heard with difficulty. His appeal
was ineffectual* and he was compelled
to go within.
At 11 o'clock Dixon was taken from
the Jail and shot to death in the jail
yard and the body was taken from
there to the corner of Main street and
Fountain avenue and hung high to a
telegraph pole, where the mob spent
the next half-hour riddling the body
with bullets from several hundred re
volvers. The mob forced an entrance

No word confirming this story has been received in any other quarter, except a dispatch from Yihkow, received during the day, which reported that the bombardment had been

It is considered here especially un
fortunate that the Japanese did not
go close enough to Vladivostok to es
tablish the identity of their ships, leav
ing the question whether they were a
division of the Port Arthur fleet in
doubt. . It is not believed, however, the
Japanese would dare to divide the lat
ter, which would involve the risk of
a sortie by the Russians and their play
ing havoc with the Japanese transport
fleet flotilla. The Japanese fleet has
not been sighted from Port Arthur for
more than a week and possibly Is try

The fact that the Russian batteries

slight chance of hitting the enemy's

partially to. a desire not to betray, the
position of the. batteries, lit is -now

China long since accepted the situa
tion end was willing to abandon Man
churia to Russia in order to save the
rest of the empire; but she is con
vinced that if one power seizes Chinese
territory a scramble for the Celestial
Empire will be^in. Therefore, she re
gards the maintenance of, her neutral
ity as a question of life or death.
Troops were dispatched to the fron
tier, and though only part of the 50,000
men in the northern porvinces were
sent. Russia demanded their with
drawal. All of China's protestations of
her good Intentions were unavailing.
She had actually to stop sending troops
to Peking, but is now considering ways
?nd means for their dispatch.
It is seen that "now or never" is the
moment for China to say "No!" to
Russia. The Peking Government hopes
that in this it will be supported by the
powers.
It states that China welcomed Mr.
Hay's proposal for her neutrality, but
soon thought that a merely - moral
guarantee would be but little protec
tion against the belligerent powers.
She, therefore, determined to take
steps to protect her northern frontier.
This was due not only to her desire to
maintain neutrality, but because she
feared that one of the belligerent pow
ers would take advantage of the oppor
tunity to seize further Chinese terri
tory.
SHANGHAI, March 7.â In every pos
sible way the Chinese authorities at
Peking are endeavoring to favor the
Japanese. In response to an imperial
official suggestion, the Northern Chi
nese railroads are withdrawing their
rolling stock within the great wall.
This action is greatly hampering the
movements of the Russian troops. As
hrdicating its attitude toward intruders
and. foreigners from Port Arthur and
Dairy, the Peking Government is re
fusing to recognize Russian naturali
zation of Chinese deported from those
places.

Vladivostok was again visited by the Japanese squadron on Monday. Reports differ as to whether
any shots were fired. Vladivostok Is defended by many forts. An English authority asserts tliat the
guns in these forts are of an old type and intimates that t|ie fortress might 'be reduced from the sea.
It Is probable that the Japanese naval authorities .know all: about the defenses of Vladivostok and the,
respect they show for them would indicate that the chances of a successful bombardment by the fleet are
remote. ;â¢', , ', ' : -:l I
Yesterday's report spoke vaguely of five battleships and several cruisers being engaged in at at
tack on Vladivostok and it was assumed that Vice Admiral Togo was in command. Japan has only six
battleships and would hardly send five of them to Vladivostok, leaving the -Port Arthur fleet free. It
probably will be found that Admiral Uriu's division has been sent around from Chemulpo and that Rus
sia's four big cruisers form the objective. . . . ; . ' ' >

China is approaching dangerously close to a breach of neutrality, in- Its attempts to hamper the
Russian military operations. All Chinese rolling stock on the Manchurlan railroads has been withdrawn
and in other ways the Peking Government is giving evidence of its sympathy for the Japanese cause. .
Placards announcing, crushing defeats of the Russians by Korean , troops, are being scattered
throughout the Hermit kingdom, with the object of inflaming the patriotism of the natives. One report
has it that the entire Russian army has been driven across the Yalu by a handful of Koreans. All of N
the Japanese troops that landed at Chemulpo are now well on their way toward the frontier.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
TOKIO, March 7.â The Russian
cruiser squadron from Vladivostok is
reported to be, cruising off the north
ern coast of Korea with the object of
preventing a possible landing in that
region by the Japanese.
Considerable public comment has
been caused by the continued pres
ence of a Russian squadron in the
Mediterranean, in view of the cases
of wanton interference with neutral
trade committed by the vessels. The
Nichi Niche wonders why .neutral
powers hesitate to assert their legit
imate rights, instead of trusting to
the Czar's compassion, as in the case
of three colliers recently detained
and later released.
Every class of people is determined
to light on to the bitter end, however
long.and costly the war may prove,
in order to aid the Government. Both
private and public expenditure is be
ing cut down as far as possible. The
Tokio municipality, for instance, has'
decided to reduce the next budget by
one-half, and other cities are follow
ing its example.
Russian scouts are reliably reported
to have penetrated south as far as
Kiungsung. The earlier Russian
movement into Northwestern Korea
was regarded as a diversion, but it
ribw appears that a considerable force
participated. It is believed that the
Russians may occupy and fortify
some strong position on the Turaen
River. '
- Reports regarding Russian move
ments in Northwestern Korea are
meager and unreliable. The force
north of the Yalu is being Increased,
but it is doubted If any considerable
number of Russians have crossed that
river. v
A number .of .trophies from . the
Russian cruiser Variag, including one
gun, have reached jj the Navy Depart
ment and have been forwarded to the
Japanese imperial court. The Crown
Prince .will accompany the Emperor
when the court removes from Tokio
to Kioto after the adjournment of the
Diet.
The Japanese Cabinet will meet to
morrow to- finally consider the. pro
gramme of financial legislation, made
necessary by the war, which is to be
submitted to the special session of the
DieU It is understood that it has
been decided, not to introduce legisla
tion affecting the tobacco monopoly.
The construction of the railroad
from Seoul to Pingyang will be com

be completed^ by, September.
PARIS, -.: ch 8.â The St. Petersburg

He will start for the Far East on

will be 217,000 Russian troops in Man
churia, the correspondent continues.
This informatien was given by a mili
tary authority.
The Matin publishes a dispatch from
Tokio, saying the Japanese Navy De
partment has announced that thirteen
Russian warships, representing a total
of 94,000 tons, have received injuries
since the opening of hostilities.
The Municipal Council has voted to
send an address to the Municipality of
St. Petersburg expressing its sympathy

It was learned last evening that
Wiley had lately been visiting a Miss
Wilson, who lives with her sister, Mrs.
W. M. Schwartz, at 1303 Ninth, street,
Alameda. Mrs. Schwartz admitted last
night that Wiley had been calling on
her sister. , Miss Wilson, it was
claimed, was how staying in this city.
The Schwartzes had not heard of
Wiley's death. Mrs. 'Schwartz said
thaj all she knew about Wiley was
that he formerly lived in Smartsvllle.
What part of Nevada Wiley came
from could not be learned. He had
evidently traveled a good deal, from
the variously addressed letters found
on him. Letters from ! his wife were
signed â¢'Leila." but the missives bore
no address and the postmarks could
not be read.
A telegram received from Seattle last
evening stated that Wiley had not been
a resident of Seattle for two years, al
though the records of the Elks Lodge
there contained his name and gave his
address in San Francisco as 2022 Cali
fornia street. The house at that number
is now vacant. He was known in Seattle
as a single man and is so registered In
the Elks' lodge.
In the dead man's pockets was found
a membership card of Washington
Lodge No. 92. B. P. O. E., of Seattle,
and several letters that had been ad
dressed to him In Smartsvllle, Yuba
County.
Mrs. Thompson said that Wiley rent
ed the furnished fiat, which was part
of her apartment-house, on February
27 last, for $40 and paid a deposit of $10.
He told her he was from Nevada and
expected his wife down in a week or so.
She knew nothing else about him.
The dead man's watch was still go
ing yesterday. The Morgue officials
state that Wiley had been dead for
about a day and a half.
The landlady, Mrs. Clara Thompson,
smelled the gas yesterday, and, think
ing the pipes were leaking, summoned
C J. Jacobson, a plumber, of 1565 Mar
ket street. Jacobson discovered the
body and notified the Morgue. The
bathroom door was locked and the
plumber had to enter through a win
dow and unlock it from the inside.
It is thought Wiley must have been
attacked by a fainting spell when he
made such a fatal connection between
the gas tubing and the stopcock han
dle. In the bathroom were towels. The
kettle he is supposed to have intended
using to heat water for his bath. He
may hav"e made the connection, as he
thought, right, and fallen asleep. Or
he may have suddenly fainted from
heart trouble.
Louis B. Wiley, a member of Seattle
Lodge of Elks, met* death by gas as
phyxiation, probably on Sunday,* in a
flat at 41 Octavia street, which he had
recently rented. Wiley's body was
found In the bathroom, fully dressed
but for coat and vest.
The body was lying on the floor, near
the door. The tube leading frym the gas
jet to a small stove was connected to the
handle of the gas stove stopcock In
stead of to the pipe, as it should have
been. The handle of the stopcock was
smaller than the tube and a stream of
monoxide was escaping. The bath tub
was half filled with water and a small
kettle stood on the stove.
Mr. Woodworth says that the ap
pointment is not made to fill the va
cancy In the assistant attorneyship
caused by the death of Edward J.
Banning. It is simply a special ap
pointment to hold during the pleasure
o"f the Attorney General.

Mr. Fickert went from Bakersfleld

OVERMAN'S POLITE OFFER.
Senator Overman is the owner of the
building in which the postofflce at Sals
bury, N. C, is located. The report says
that on taking his seat as a United
States Senator he offered .to surrender
the lease, but the offer was declined
by the Government, it being held that
the lease was not Invalidated by his
election as Senator.
In writing George B. Beavers in an
effort to. get better quarters for the
postoffice at Nelsonvllle, Ohio, Repre
sentative Grosevnor says: "I am
ashamed to look the -people of the town
in the face. Can you help ine out in
this matter in any way?"
A recommendation, "Suggest- Dal
zell," made by Beavers with reference
to the naming of a - postofflce in Penn
sylvania is given in the report, but
the conclusion is given that the recom
mendation evidently was not complied
with, as the office is called "Forbes
Station."
The report declares that the files in
the Postoffice Department indicate that
the office at Tuskegee, Ala., is owned
by Representative Thompson of Ala
bama. The report gives the corre
spondence between Beavers and Rep
resentative Thompson on his successful
efforts to have the rent allowance In
creased from $240 "to $300 anually. ;
Senator Kearns j secured two in
creases in Utah. Six out of the eleven
cases in Virginia are down to the credit
of Representative Swanson, while
Park Agnews' name also appears for
others in that State. Senator Foster
and Representatives Ciishman and
Jones combined to secure an increased
allowance at Dayton, Wash., from $300
to $600, afterward reduced to $120 and
( then increased to $200. Representative
Cushmari alone secured an allowance
of $300 annually for Carbondale, Wash.,
which was discontinued on examina
tion afterward. Senator Elkins and
Senator Scott and Representative Day
ton secured increases for West Vir
ginia. The two cases of increase for
Wisconsin are down to the credlt~of
former Representative Barney and to
A. W. Mgchen. Wyoming had one such
increase/ to the credit of Senator War
ren,. There are accounts of -177 in
stances In the report where members
of Congress have made . recommenda
tions in connection with' leases of
buildings for postoffice purposes. The
history of these transactions occupies
164 pagestof the printed report. An il
lustration of the nature of these trans
actions may. be had by the following
quotation from the report: "

Practically all of the Japanese troops
that landed at Chemulpo and occupied
Seoul have now proceeded on the
northward march. While the censor
ship will not permit the sending of
any news regarding the advance, it
may be said that the entire Japanese
army. in Western Korea is expected to
have routed the Russians on the Yalu
and begun the invasion of Manchuria
by the end of April.
SEfOUL, March 8. â Placards reporting
Korean triumphs over the Russians on
the northwestern frontier are being
distributed broadcast throughout the
country, probably with the object of
arousing, the patriotism of the people
and counteracting the efforts of the
faction which is opposed to the Jap
anese protectorate. One placard an
nounces the killing of thirty Cossacks
by Koreans in the vicinity of Chenam
pho, and another reports the rout of
a large Russian force by a small band
of Koreans, the scene of the exploit
not being announced.
To further incite the natives, pla
cards charging the Russians with
gross cruelties are posted in public
places in the larger towns. It Is
claimed that the invaders are. mal
treating women and robbing the inhab
itants of the districts which they have
occupied. Japanese / official reports
make no reference to occurrences of
this kind, but it is believed the Jap
anese are interested in the spreading
of the reports among Jhe Koreans.
An official bulletin has been issued,
asserting that a Korean army has de
feated the Russians at Hwangju and
driven the entire Russian army across
the Yalu River.

ASPHYXIATED
IN BATHROOM
It is the belief in official circles here
that at the present moment there are
not more than 122,000 Russian troops
in Manchuria, notwithstanding the
Russian claims that more than a quar
ter of a million men have been sent
into the province. As this force must
protect the railroads and garrison the
towns and as well oppose the Japanese
advance, It is believed that the ob
stacles in the way of a Japanese
Invasion of Manchuria will be easily
overcome. The Japanese army advanc
ing through Korea is numerically
much stronger than the Russian force
stationed on the Yalu.
TOKIO. March 7.â The Russian bat
tleship Retvizan, which waa torpedoed
during the first attack on Port Arthur
and since then has been stranded near
the entrance to the harbor, is being

mounted in the fortifications. Efforts
to float the Retvizan have proved fu
tile, and finally Admiral Alexieff or
dered that they bo abandoned. In
each successive attack upon Port Ar
thur Admiral Togo's warships have
hurled a few shells into the Retvizan
to complete her destruction, the bat
tleship occupying an exposed position,
easy of attack. /

PORT ARTHUR. March 8.â There Is

PORT ARTHUR, March 5 (via Tln

fighting here In the past seven days,
and only twice in that time have any
of the Japanese ships been seen. On
those occasions a portion of the fleet
appeared on the horizon, cruised about
within sight of the fortifications and
then disappeared. It is believed that
either Admiral Togo has divided his
fleet, and is making an occasional dem
onstration to create the impression that
his entire force la hoverlns in the vi
cinity of Port Arthur, or that he la
attempting to lure the Russian ships
from the harbor.
Since the arrival of Admiral Makar
off, who succeeds Admiral Stark in
command of the Russian fleet, there
has been great activity aboard the
Russian ships, and it la believed that
some sortie is being planned. Makaroff
may attempt a sudden dash out of
the harbor, with the hope of elud
ing the Japanese fleet, and cruising
southward, where he could work un
told damage by attacking the Japanese
transport squadrons that are convoy
ing troops to the western coast of
Korea. It fs possible that he could
effect a union with the Vladivostok
squadron, thus giving him a force pow
erful enough to engage the fleet under
Togo.
Strong intrenchments have been
thrown up at intervals on Liaotune:
Peninsula, north of Port Arthur, and
the garrison has been heavily in
creased to resist attack from the land
side of the city. Apparently it la the
Russian intention to hold the strong
hold at all hazards. The reports of a
shortage of provisions and ammuni
tion are without foundation. Quan
tities of supplies have been poured into
the city and Port Arthur could with
stand a siege of a year if necessary.
The sudden cessation of Japanese
operations in this vicinity is puzzling
the Russians. The theory that finds
the greatestsupport is that the Japan
ese have afmndoned the idea of cap
turing the city by a direct attack and
will first land an army near Xew
chwang, which the Russians are pre
paring to evacuate. This force could
then move southward on LJaotung
Peninsula, and, if victorious, would, by
obtaining command of the peninsula,
insure the ultimate fall of Port Arthur
without great sacrifice.
There has been a pleasant change
in the weather and the cold season is
believed to be about at an end. The
spirits of the garrison are high, and
the men are eager for a fight. Coa
sacks are constantly moving on Uad
tung Peninsula, keeping a watch for
attempts by the Japanese to land
troops. It la reported that 10.000 Jap
anese have disembarked at a point
forty miles south of Newchwang and
that this force will receive heavy'^ad
ditions and then attempt the con
quest of LJaotung.
Since February 13 43,000 men have
gone forward to reinforce the Russian
army on the Yalu River. It Is not
believed that the Japanese advance
will be seriously opposed until it
reaches the Yalu, where the decisive
land engagement of the war will be
fought. This battle is not likely to oc
cur for a month yet. as the Japanese
advance is impeded by bad roads.

Meanwhile Keith, the Postmaster, is In a
good deal of a stew about making up his re

TROUBLE ABOUT FURNITURE.
The department undertook the secur

making contract therefor with the Cor

$1850. There appears to have been great
delay in getting the furniture ready, as
the following correspondence between
the Congressman and Mr. Beavers

Dear Beavers: I do not know who la to blame
for the condition of things which I found here
when I reached home, but I am afraid some
body will, find themselves In trouble before
we get through. As I understand It, the lease
of the new po3tpfflce wae taken for the first
of July and the fixtures are partly In, but
there are no boxes and no desks or chairs, or
any facilities whatever for doing business. I
understand that Mr. White came down here
several days ago, having sent word in ad
vance to be prepared to move everything from
the old postofflce to the new, and when he
arrived here found, of course, that it was 1m
poeslble to do that, as the fittings had not
come.

On March 4, 1902,' Mr. White reported
that the old lessors did not wish a re
newal of the" lease; that the Business
Men's Association desired that the of

Mrs." Weed; that this offer was not
satisfactory and that the rent demand
ed was $1200 a year. He reported a con

J. Hill was present and stated that he
thought he would be able to get the
Postofflce Department to furnish the

Two propositions are submitted by
the Norwalk Club, one at $900 per an

E. J. Hill, House of Representatives â Sir:
I beg to acknowledge receipt of your favor
of the Oth inst. in regard to delay in fitting
up new premises for postofflce at Norwalk,
Conn. Assistant Superintendent White has
been directed to give, the case his Immediate
attention. The department will ascertain who
Is to blame in the matter and Appropriate â¢ ac
tion wlllbe taken.
I trust the matter will be setled I to your
satisfaction in a few days. Very resfectfully,
tions will be excellent, yea, more than excel
lent; they will be superb, but everything seems
to go slow. Impression Is you ought to give
your man White a dose of ginger or pepper,
or perhaps both would answer better, every
day and see if you could infuse into him some
of your own personal way of dispatching busi
ness. I cm inclined to think it would be a
good thing. .
Not only is there what seems to be uneces
tary delaT being . had â¢ In ' regard to it, but
Keith Is worrying over the fact that he can
not send in his accounts for the last quarter,
Mr. White having told. htm to hold them back
until these thing* are . adjusted. He has al
ready been criticised for slowness in that- mat
ter and he hardly knows what to do. If you
can in any* possible way supplement my letter
to the Corbtn Cabinet Company by peremptory
orders to have the contract filled, - so that the
new office - can he opened . and , the ' old one
closed and the case closed up, I think you
will relieve the minds of a whole lot of people
up here and at the same time save the United
States Government unnecessary payment of
rÂ«nt for two different places. Very truly yours,

CONGRESSMEN* ARE ACTIVE
"Section 39 of the Revised Statutes
provides: 'No member of or delegate
to Congress shall, directly or indirect
ly, himself, or by any other person in
trust for him, or for his use or benefit,
or on his account undertake, execute,
hold or enjoy, in whole or in part, 'any
contract or agreement made or entered
into on behalf of the United States by
any officer or person authorized to
make contracts on behalf of the United
States.'
"The statute further provides:
"All contracts or agreements made In
violation of this section shall be void.
"Yet, in the face of this statute,
Beavers has "made contracts with mem
bers of Congress for the rental of prem
ises, either in his own name, the names
of his agents, or some member of their
families.
The report is made by the unanimous
vote of the -members of Overstreet's
committee, In response to a resolution
calling for the information, introduced
by Representative Hay of Virginia. As
the information accompanies the re
port, the committee recommends that
the resolution lie on the table. 'Some
of the transactions involving members
of Congress recorded in the report are
held to be technical violations of the
statutes, others are pronounced by
members who have read the report as
clearly censurable, while in the major
ity of cases It is held that members in
making their recommendations to the
department expected nothing not In
harmony with the rules and practices
of the department.
Three cases are set' forth in which
members of Congress own buildings

740 Market StreetThe mystery surrounding the
murder of Joseph Buttgenbach,
the proprietor of the Pacific;
Packing Company, is proving
one of the most troublesome
ever presented to the , police.
The detectives admit that their
work yesterday added nothing
to their means of solving it,
while it compels them to dis
charge two suspects, Edward
Gonzales and John Kiley. The
son of the murdered man, Al
bert Buttgenbach, and his
bookkeeper, J.ouis Brnne, are
still held pending further inves
tigation, but much of the evi
dence â¢ - on which the police
counted as weighing against one
or â¢ both of them is falling to
stand close investigation. No
new witnesses were found yes
terday. The detectives are face
to face with a balance of proba
bilities that the real perpetra
tors of the crime made their'es
cape in the dark alley known
as Shipley street or over the
roofs of the stables that abut
the packing establishment. The
neighborhood is one to make
such escapes easy and their
tracking difficult. Unless the
police strike a productive lead
within the next twenty-four
hours the murderer of Buttgen
bach is likely to escape punish
menr. Coroner Lcland has set
the Inquest for to-day.

Evidently Nichols will not be a
strong witness against Buttgenbach
and Brune. As : for the bookkeeper,
there is even less reason for holding
him than in the case of the murdered
man's son. Absolutely no motive can
be suggested to~lhvolve him in -the
murder and he is being held merely
under suspicion that he may know
something against his employer's
youngest son. . ,
â¢ In, the absence of further testimony
to incriminate the young man the po
lice i yesterday ihad to listen to many
statements in his favor. Those coming
from*- his , own family .were uniformly
strong and convincing, and,' of course,
they are entitled, to ; the Â¦ greatest
weight. His elder brother, Hugo A.
Buttgenbach, who ; was also employed
in - the said :
"We have the most perfect assurance
that my -brother " is innocent. . y I know
that he never owned a revolver in his
life, and. there; was \ absolutely no mo
tive for him to commit such a fearful
crime as the police suspect^ him of."
. L'awrence, Weber, brother-in-law of
Joseph i-' Buttgenbach and for many
years employed as foreman in the . fac
tory,' : is positive that . the ; murder " was
the 'iwo'ric, of two young fellows he saw
near the door of the establishment
when he went home just , before 10
o'clock. ' His -statement- follows:
: "I left the factory -just a few iriin-',
utes\ before the shooting. As I
NOTHING AGAINST BRUNE.
"I was putting up my horse when I
heard the shot, followed immediately
afterward by the sound of falling
glass. I was so busy with the horse
that I could not turn to the door for
several minutes, probably five, and at
least four minutes, after I heard these
noises. Then I stood looking out for
about three minutes. During this
time I saw no one, come out of the
factory. That is all I know and all
I shall be able to tell in court."
* : _ +
rushed instantly to the sidewalk and
stood there for some minutes watching
the factory door across the street, and
that no one came out of that door or
passed up or down Shipley street until
the arrival of the crowds and police
officers that were attracted by the
noise.
This story was knocked into smith
ereens yesterday, by Nichols' own
statement to two representatives of The
Call. He said: >
ODESSA. Russia, March 7.â Eruptiv* ty
phus prevails bet*. Flfty-threÂ« ease* havÂ»

BERLIN. Mareh 7. â Frlta Pang*, a . banker
of Wetsselfela. Saxony, was convicted at Naum
burg to-day of the embezzlement of $70,230
and was sentenced to four years' lmprl- nment
in the penitentiary.
Captain Martin gave considerable
time yesterday to. the case of Edward
Gonzales and John Riley, the ex-con
victs who were seen in the neighbor
hood of the packing establishment on
Saturday evening and were taken into
custody on suspicion. The two suspects
were "sweated" at some length and all
The police am now convinced that
if the shooting was not done by the
son of the, victim, it was the work
of two men, one of whom was proba
bly engaged in a scuffle with Buttgen
bach, while the other .fired through
the window separating the office
where the wounded man was found
from the butcher shop in front. This
would account for the fact that Butt
genbach was hit 'on the top of the
head 'near the forehead. If he had
been standing ud full height such a
wound would not have been possible.
When he fell it was beneath a shelf
or table' placed just underneath the
window that was pierced by the bul
let. In failing It would seem that the
wounded man struck out wildly for
support and in so doing drove his hand
through the glass door leading from
the office to the butcher shop. This
theory accounts for all the visible facts
discovered by the police, except those
connected with the fright that at
tacked young Buttgenbach' and Book
keeper Brune and led them to break
through into the saloon. If Albert
had shot his father it is likely that
some trail would have marked his
flight from the scene of his crime to
the partition. But the closest scrutiny
failed to disclose any blood spots,
either on the young man or the places
he is known to have visited during the
few critical moments after the shoot-

against Albert. He never had any real
quarrels with his father, and there was
no cause for any such. The old man al
lowed him $18 a week, which, with his
free -board and lodging at home, was
liberal. He .did . not j have expensive
habits nor. play the races, so far as I
know. He never owned a revolver, and
he always was an affectionate and du
tiful son."
Mrs. Lltzens is a sister of Riley, and
another sister is the wife of Gonza'es.
This story told by Gonzales was re
peated In all its essentials by Riley
and confirmed by the other persons
they named, when the police ques
tioned them. Hence there is no rea
son for believing that the two young
men were concerned In the murder.
Gonzales says that about 9:30 p. m.
he and a man named Woods went with
Riley to the saloon at Fourth and Fol

GOXZALES' STATEMENT.
A rlarinn and almost successful at
tempt to loot the Jewelry store of
Cohn Bros., 1034 Market street, was
frustrated about 11 o'clock last night
by the accidental discovery of the
crook at work in the store.
One of the members of the firm was
returning from the theater and while
passing his establishment happened
to glance through the glasa door. Ho
was startled to see a fellow in the
place and immediately sought an of
ficer. Patrolman J. E. Dolan was
found and accompanied Cohn back to
the store. The door was opened and
the bracelets soon adorned the wrists
of the burglar. He was booked at the
Southern station on a charge of burg
lary and gave his name as Charles
Johnson. He claims to be an iron
worker and an iron crank was found
in his possession.
Entrance was effected to the store
through the roof and the police be
lieve the fellow in custody had two
accomplices, who escaped.

JOSEPH BUTTGENBACH DIES OF GUNSHOT WOUND RECEIVED ON SATURDAY NIGHT;
SAN FRANCISCO POLICE ARE BAFFLED IN ATTEMPT TO DISCOVER THE MURDERER
stantial evidence, and for this the
chain is undeniably weak.
INQUEST THIS MORNING.'
Coroner Leland has set the inquest
for this morning at 10 o'clock. There is
considerable surprise at the Coroner's
action in hurrying on the Inquest be
fore the police have had time to com
plete their investigation. An autopsy
was performed yesterday by Dr. J. B.
Bacigalupi, whose report, in its tech
nical language, is as follows:
The cause of death is shock and hemorrhage
due to gunshot wound of brain. The bullet en
tered the brain one and a half Inches behind
the frontal parietal suture, one and a half
Inches to the right of the interparietal suture
â passed In a direction downward and back
ward and to the left through the left hemi
sphere at (parietal) lobe, thence through the
occipital lobe of the left heiujsphere, at the
posterior and. Inferior extremity of which the
very much flattened bullet was found lodged.
Kvldence of powder burns, etc., were removed
by the hospital surgeons, who shaved the hair
completely oft the vertex of scalp.
In plain English the autopsy sur
geon's report means that the bullet en
tered Buttgenbach's brain on the
apex of the skull on a line with the
right eye, took a downward course to
the left and .rear, and was found
lodged against the skull at the base
of fhe brain. The calliber of the bul
let could not be determined conclu
sively, it was so battered by coming
in contact with the skull, but its
weight Indicated that it was from a
38-caliber revolver, and therefore was
similar to the five cartridges found on
the floor of Buttgenbach's office after
the tragedy.
The search for the revolver that did
the deadly deed took several hours of
the detectives' time yesterday, but
proved unsuccessful. This is one of
the difficulties of the case, for the dis
covery of the pistol might settle more
than one question that is troubling
the police.
MYSTERY OP REVOLVER,
When arrested in Alpers & Helde's
saloon Albert Buttgenbach had no re
volver In his possession. If he did the
shooting he had but a .few seconds in
which to dispose of . the instrument.
According to his own story he first ran
back, from the' office toward the.en
gine-room at the rear of the" building
before he followed Brune through the
partition into the saloon. ,On this
statement the detectives conclud
ed that, if he did the shoot
ing, .they might find the pistol in
the furnace. Therefore they had this
cleaned out yesterday, only to dls-.
cover no traces of such a weapon
among the ashes. ' ..'
All over the premises they searched
with the same object in view and with
the same result. The only reward for
their industry was the discovery of an
old and well rusted. 32-caliber re
volver ; lying in the. loft and evidently
long innocent of use.
"This same loft, however, adds to the
The only other witness whom the

that Albert Buttgenbach can be con

The personal witnesses on whose
statements the pork packer's son is now
being held are not any | more likely to
satisfy a Jury. One of these is Sam
Mason, the negro formerly employed by
Buttgenbach and discharged some
weeks ago , at the instance of his son
Albert, â¢'whom Mason now accuses.
Mason's story is that the youth had a
revolver for some time before the mur
der, that he was seen by Mason chang
ing this revolver from his right to his
left * pocket ; shortly before â¢ the crime,
and that he had frequently threatened
his father because the latter was close
with the boy.
A host of witnesses rose up yesterday
to contradict Mason on the story of the
revolver,- some of them merely saying
that Albert had "never carried a re

lice now have to work onâ the theory
that young Buttgenbaeh is a parricide.
If the youth killed his father, why
should he have . forced his way into
the adjoining, saloon instead of mak
ing an escape through the loft to the
roofs of the stables adjacent, from
which it would have been an easy mat
ter to drop to the ground in the dark
and thus disappear? Why, too, is it
not possible that, if the murder \Vas
committed by footpads, they may not
have escaped by this route? Doubtless

neighborhood, and it may have been

Joseph Buttgenbach, who was foully
ehot Saturday night in his office at the
Pacific Packing Company's establish
ment, Fourth and Shipley streets, died
yesterday morning in St. Joseph's Hos
pital at the hour of 4:30. He had been
unconscious from the time he was
shot, and thus the cause of justice
loses the invaluable service it might
have received from his ante-mortem
statement as to the facts of the crime.
Though two days have passed since
the shooting of Buttgenbach the mys
tery of the crime seems to be no nearer
a solution than when the police .began
their search for its author. The de
tectives have wholly failed to obtain
evidence that would Justify their
further holding of two of the men un
der arrest, Edward Gonzales and John
Riley, and these ex*-convicts probably,
will be discharged this morning. The
case against Buttgenbach's son, Albert
and his bookkeeper, Louis Brune, was
not strengthened yesterday. Unless
the police find better reason for hold
ing them; they, too, will doubtless have
to be discharged, as the evidence
against them would hardly stand the
scrutiny of a preliminary hearing be
fore a committing magistrate.
Not a single material witness, not
a material fact that points to the de
tection of the murderer was developed
yesterday.' Last night Captain John
Martin, chief of detectives, and Thomas
L. Ryan, the sleuth specially detailed
on the case, admitted that the day had
brought them no progress, while it had
disposed of some of their theories.
While they are still hopeful of tracing
the crime to its source they are con
fessedly working^n the dark and trust
ing to good fortune to help them out.
UNSATISFACTORY RESULTS.
The unsatisfactory results of the de
tectives' work Is not wholly due to
their lack of prescience. The case is
undoubtedly one of the hardest nuts
ever given the San Francisco police de
partment to crack. The crime w9^
committed in a locality that is accus
tomed to sensations and hence is slow
to pick up its ears and start a pursuit
merely because it happens to hear a
pistol shot. â¢
It occurred in an almost darkened
building on a dark alleyâ for Shipley
street is but a blind pocket running
back to a nest of stables and other
shacks â which afford as good a chance
for escape as a footpad with a murder
on his conscience could find in all the
great 'region south of Market. Few
people were on Fourth street at the
hour- of the shooting, and no one has
been found who can give anything ap
proaching direct evidence pointing to
the criminals. If they are ever con
victed it roust be wholly uporTcircum-

KAISER TELLS OF LOSS
OF A CHERISHED FRIEND
WASHINGTON, March 7.â Postal af
fairs engrossed the attention of the
House to-day, practically to the exclu
sion of all else. The subject was In
troduced by Overstreet, chairman of
the Committee on Postofflces and Post
roads, who submitted the report of that
committee on the Hay resolution call-
Ing for certain information regarding
the use of "influence" by members of
the House to secure increases in salary
for Postmasters.
Overstreet, in connection with the re
port, said that in his opinion there was
not a single instance of any reflection
on the integrity of any member.
The postoffice appropriation bill was
then taken up, and Moon (D.) of Ten
nessee, the ranking minority member
of the Postcffice Committee, arraigned
the present- system employed, in the
Postofflce Department and made an
appeal for a general investigation of
the affairs of the department. Cow
herd (D.) qf Missouri, also a member
of the committee, followed with an
analytical review of the charges made
in the Bristow report, which he re
ferred to as a shameful story of fraud
and maldaminlstration.
Wltho'ut debate the House unani
mously adopted the resolution of
Martin (Rep.) of South Dakota, direct
ing the Secretary of Commerce and
Labor to investigate the causes of the
differences which' exist betwen the
prices of live cattle and dressed beef.
Overstreet made an elaborate ; expla
nation of the provisions of the bill.
While he was, speaking a messenger
brought in and *aid on the doorkeeper's
desk a bundle of the reports accompa
nying the Hay resolution. Members
crowded around the desk and business
was suspended until every member had
procured 'a copy of the report.
Moon of Tennessee, the ranking
i minority member of the . Postofflce
Committee, disavowing any political
purpose in view of the evidence at
hand, urged it to be the duty of the
House to look closely into the affairs of
the Postofflce Department. The system
of administration, he said, was weak, 7
and an investigation might enable the
House to revise and strengthen the sys
tem.'
\ The "slime," he said,' which had been
found in one branch may ; have per
meated other branches. He said that
the names ' of 150 members had been
linked with the wrongdoing in the
Poatoffice Department, not Justly, he
said,' except in ; a" very * few cases, but
he asked; how this would be viewed.
He "exonerated the Republicans .from
any desire to protect wrongdoers in^of
fice,but'said they were "derelict in hot
providing a better system. It â¢ was not
a! partisan matter, but an issue that
must be met.

J. Lambert to a piece of Los Angeles
real estate owned by John Gerner was

some recommendation from the depart
ment after these disclosures for a
change In the methods?" asked Mr.
Cowherd. "Yet no recommendations
came."
This was his reason for demanding a
Congressional investigation of the de
partment. As instancing the necessity
still further, he called attention to the
item of $1,000,000 In the bill for separat
ing the mails in the third and fourth
class postoffices. This item, last year,
he said, was $1,300,000, "and It was in
the disbursing of that appropriation
that Brlstow charged that Beavers had
used it to advance his political stand
ing and to give away to his personal
and political friends."
Mr. Vanduser of Nevada entertained

Mr. Murdock of Kansas said the de

of the revenues. He said if .there had
been a Theodore Roosevelt to cut a
canal across the isthmus so Columbus
could have sailed through and discov
ered the United States on the West
ern coast, the people of the New Eng-
land States would now be asking: foi
admission to statehood.
The committee rose and the resolu
tion by Martin of South Dakota di
recting the Secretary of Commerce anc
Labor to Investigate the causes for th<
differences which exist between th(
cost of livestock and dressed beef wai
passed without division or debate.
A bill providing so as to allow the
Klowa, Chlckasaw and Fort Smitt
Railway Company to sell all Its rail
road and other property in Indian Ter
ritory was passed.
The House, at 5:40, adjourned untl
to-morrow.
The general dissatisfaction, it Is stat
ed, is aggravated further by much
needless circumlocution in public busi
ness and the frequency with which bne
authority is reversed by another. The
report expresses the opinion that it was
an error of policy so to frame the stat
utes providing for allotment in several
ty among the Five Tribes as to permit
any Indian to obtain more land than
he could occupy personally with profit
and to fail adequately to. recognize the
difference between a'real Indian- and a
white or black man having the rights
of an Indian.
It is recommended that the Indian
Territory be divided as soon as prac
ticable into districts which may here
after become counties of a future State,
and that every such district have an
officer to supervise Indian leases, per
form probate and notarial duties and
to serve as a committing magistrate
and Judge of petty cases, etc. In order
to relieve the dockets of the United
States court, it is urged that all leases
of allotted lands should be recorded
within thirty days of their date, other-
Vise t*> be invalid, and that the system
of sealed bids for allotted lands should
be maintained in all cases.
Concluding,, the report says:
"The officers of the, inspector and
agents should be independent -of each
oth'er and intrusted with greater pow
ers of initiative and determination. In
general, the administration of j public
affairs in the Territory should be com
mitted to officers | on the spot, carefully
supervised but controlled from Wash
ington."
CHANGES ARE PROPOSED.
The report says that the Brosius
charges that the trust companies are
manipulating Indian lands were made
in good faith and continues: Â¦
"Conditions prevailing in the Indian
Territory at the present time are alto
gether abnormal. Multitudes of cor
porations have sprung up there as de
scribed by Brosius "and the purposes
and methods of a large, proportion of
these corporations are such as- to make
It obviously improper for Federal offi
cers In the territory and especially for
members of the commission to hold
their stock.
"There are undoubtedly other corpora
tions engaged in legitimate business,
but a censorious and uncharitable pub
lic opinion, ln ; the territory and else
where does not discriminate accurately
between the two classes, and when it is
known that a member of the commis
sion has placed large sums of money
in the stock of various trust companies^
and corporations of like character he"
becomes, however unjustly in fact,
identified In the public mind with the
principles and practices of the disrepu
table and unscrupulous speculators who
have there broughf discredit on all en
terprises."
Speaking of the present situation in
the Territory, the report says that the
real Indians who have remained In
dians, constituting scarcely one-twen

the profound discontent existing among
the white people of the Territory and
the very general want of confidence in
public officials.
He says It Is confidently expected
that the Dawes commission will finish

"It is to my mind questionable
whether it were not better to bear the
ills we have' than to submit vast in
terests, involving the homes and prop
erty rights of so many thousands of
poor and ignorant people who are de
pendent upon and entitled to the spe

official." \
WASHINGTON, March 7.â The Pres
ident to-day transmitted to Congress
a report of Charles J. Bonaparte and
Clinton Rogers Woodruff in the mat
ter of irregularities in Indian Terri
tory.
The report is accompanied by a let
ter from Secretary Hitchcock to the
President concurring as to the refer
ences to the Federal officials and asking
for a conference with the President re
garding them at the earliest practical
moment, and saying he will later con
sider the proposed sweeping changes in
the organization and administrative
methods which require much new legis
lation and possibly the negotiation of
supplemental agreements with the In
dians. Secretary Hitchcock adds , that
the baseless impression reported , to
have obtained. in "the Indian Territory
as to the practice and procedure in
the* department relative to appeals, is
not surprising in view of the "atmos
phere of suspicion and calumny which
pervades the Territory." He says, how
ever: . _
General von Einem spoke again, and
referring to Herr Bebel's assurance
that the Socialists would do their dutj
in defense of the fatherland, he said II
gave him great pleasure.
# BERLIN, March 7.*-In the Reichstaj
to-day the case of Lieutenant Prince
Prosper von Arenberg came up during
the discussion of the military, budget;
Herr Bebel, the Socialist leader, aske^
General von Einem, the War Minister'
for information concerning the condlÂ«
tions which govern the entrance of offl-j
cers Into the army. He pointed out
that Prince von Arenberg had beeri
mentally and morally disqualified fronq
duty as an officer since his childhood,
and that after he entered the army hÂ»
committed a series of brutalities which
not only went unpunished, but whlcl;
resulted in the Prince being sent id,
Southwest Africa.
General von Einem replied that
Prince von Arenberg's early life wa4
entirely unknown to the military au
thorities at the time he entered thÂ«
army. â¢Â»
"No blame attaches to the mllltarj
administration for sending the Princ^
tn Southwest Africa." explained thÂ«
Minister of War. Referring to General
von Einem's remark about the Social-!
ists In the army Herr Bebel said that
pioneers were nearly all Socialists. "W^
do not hoist the red flag," he continued^
"but you cannot take our sentiment*
from us. You cannot fight a successful
war without us."
The number of bills being introduced
daily does not diminish out of respect
for the manifest desire of Congress as
a body to adjourn. But the desire of
individual members to get home to their
districts, where there is so much to in
terest them all Just now, will override
regrets over the submersion of any but
bills of paramount importance.
It will be seen from all this proposed
legislation that the vast and. varied
sources of wealth in the almost unex
plored reaches of Alaska are coming to
be, in some measure, realized in Wash
ington and i this realization will no
doubt secure for it a delegate on the
floor next session.
A: bill to make a game preserve of
the Olympic forest reserve ; in Wash
ington, introduced to-day by Humph
reys) is explained by an interesting' let
ter to Senator Foster from the Fish and
Game Protective Association of that
State. The letter says that during the
winter a large number of elk on the
forest reserve have been slaughtered for
nothing but their teeth. Two instances
are given, one of a bunch of eight and
another of eleven elk killed in the deep
snow and their bodies allowed to re
main where they fell, their teeth being
removedâ carried away as trinkets for
gentlemen. Senator Foster, to whom
an appeal was made, had to reply that
the United States had no authority to
regulate the game laws of the State,
and even in case of a game preserve
the United States could not exercise
police authority. other than to put the
hunter oft! the grounds. Humphreys'
bill is an attempt at a corrective.
erning and controlling all fisheries in
the district 'and to send a staff of men
from his department to investigate and
report annually upon all work required

The following streams are excepted
from the regulation making It unlawful
to fish above the line of mean low tide:
Yukon, Kuskokwim, Nushagak, Chig
nik, Sushitna, Naknek, Kvichak, Knick,
Ccpper, Alsek, Taku, Speel,' Waiting,
Stiklne and Unuk rivers and Broadfleld

MAY GRANT A DELEGATE.
Cushman of Washington has a bill
providing for the appointment of road
overseers having authority to summon
all able bodied men between the ages
of 18 and 50 years to work on the roads
in the precinct for. two days each year.
Cushman also has a : bill authorizing
and directing the Secretary of War to
survey and construct a military trial
commencing at or near the intersec
tion of the Orazek and the Yukon
River to Coldfoot on the Koyukuk. Ten
thousand dollars is named as the ap
propriation for the purpose.
Jones of Washington is the father of
several Alaskan bills, the latest, of
which is one granting to the Valdez,
Copper River and Tanana Railroad a
subsidy of $5000 per mile of track con
structed, trunk line or spurs, provided
the work on the road is actually begun
prior to July 1 this year.
Finally, among the Washington dele
gation, Humphrey has submittQd a bill
looking after the fish industry of . the
district. It makes it unlawful to build
dams and fish traps in any stream
above the limit of ocean tides and re
quires that all those so built must be
removed. It is made unlawful to fish
for red or king salmon except with rod
or spear or gaff hook above the mouth
at mean low tide of any creek or river
less than 500 feet wide in Alaska. Re
strictions are, laid about the setting of
nets in the mouth of rivers so that they
shall not interfere with other nets, and
it makes it unlawful to take salmon in
any manner whatever except in waters
tributary to Bristol Bay, Bering Sea ,
between the hour of 6 p. m. Saturday
and 6 a. m. Monday. The Secretary of
Commerce and Labor is empowered to
fix the line of mean low tide at any
place where a doubt exists. He may
also prohibit fishing with nets in any
estuary or lagoon, and may set aside
spawning groundsâ not, however, until
full opportunity has been . allowed a,ll
parties interested to be heard. The
secretary is also empowered to estab
lish .and promulgate, regulations gov-
Senator Ankeny of Washington has
a bill directed at the oil interest of
Alaska and provides that where oil
lands are located In the district of
Alaska as placer mining claims the an
nual assessment of labor upon such
claims may be done upon any one of
a group lying contiguous and owned by
the same person or corporation, pro
viding said labor will tend to the de
velopment of such contiguous claims or
the determination of the oil bearing
character thereof.
.PREPARE MILITARY TRAIL.
The great flood of Alaskan bills, daily
being augmented, also stand some
slight show. Beveridge. from the Sen
ate Committee on Territories, stamps
with favor Nelson's bill for a delegate
to Congress from the far northern dis
trict. That is a considerable step, and
inasmuch as it provides for an elective
and not an appointive delegate, and in
a Senate bill, the indications are all in
favor of its passage. If It gets through
the Senate it is not likely to fail in
the House. The bill provides for an
election this summerâ the first Tues
day in August. The door is thrown
wide open to candidates. The delegate
must have been a citizen of the United
States seven years, be not less than
25 years of age, and a qualified elector
of Alaska. A qualified elector of Alaska
is one who Is of age, who has lived
a year in the district and sixty days
In his precinct. Each town is made
an election district. The first delegate
elected will, under the bill, serve un
til March 3, 1905. An election will be
held in August every year when there
is a general election for Representa
tives to Congress. The delegate. In
lieu of mileage, receives liis actual
traveling expenses from his home to
Seattle and return, and from Seattle to
Washington and return mileage.
As showing: how the* interest In
Alaskan affairs is spreading, the most
important bill amending the mining
laws as affecting the district has been
introduced by Senator Foster of Wash
ington, who was not a member of the
Senate commission that visited the dis
trict, and members of which have been
responsible for most of the bills re
lating thereto. Senator Foster's bill en
larges the Burface area of quartz
claims to 1500 feet square and does not
allow the owner of the claim to follow
the dip of the vein beyond the vertical
planes of his boundary line. A five
foot shaft must be sunk on the claim
within ninety days after recording. On
placer claims $100 worth of work must
be done within 90 days after recording
and as much more every twelve months
as "assessment work." Of this work
affidavits must be made. Claim jump
ing is made a criminal offense. Ifo
man may stake more than one claim
on a creek either for himself or others
in any one year. This bill is before the
Committee on Territories.
In view of this situation, bills of less
general but of equal importtance and
interest locally In the West are thought
to have a fair fighting chance. Among
these are California's 5 per cent and
the Sequoia grove.
MAXY ALASKAN BELLS.
WASHINGTON, March 7. â The
month of May is written down for the
time limit for this sitting of Congress.
The appropriation bills are largely in
the hands of the enrolling clerk. The
canal zone must be provided with a
suitable machinery of government,
looking to Its good conduct. This is
about all the legislation of a manda
tory nature that remains to employ
Congress. The disposition seems to be
to get through. Although this disposi
tion is manifested about this time of
the year every session, there seems to
be little doubt that the adjournment
will be early. Kittredge has sub
mitted a bill for the temporary govern
ment of the Panama canal territory,
and it Is in the hands of the Committee
on Interoceanic Canals. It is not a
complex scheme that it proposes, and
Congress need not delay its adjourn
ment long on Its account, giving it,
nevertheless, the careful attention that
is its due and that it will receive.

LONDON. March 7. â In the House
of Commons to-night, on a motion of
adjournment for the purpose of giving
the Premier an opportunity to relate
the circumstances surrounding: res
ignations from his Cabinet last au
tumn. Balfour reviewed at length the
entire situation before and after the
crisis. Referring: to his pamphlet,
which was sent to the Cabinet mem
bers in August, the Premier turned
his batteries on Lord George Hamil
ton, formerly Secretary for India,
saying he had failed to deny the state
ments attributed to him until Balfour
had publicly declared them to be
"totally untrue."
It was not within the region of prac
tical politics to suggest a tax of food,
the Premier continued, and Joseph
Chamberlain had reached a similar
conclusion.
Concerning the allegation that he
had kept any material facts from his
colleagues, the Premier said he could
not imagine a more preposterous state
ment or a more discreditable one, were
It true. Never had a more foolish or
more baseless charge been made than
that he had jockeyed his right honor
able friend out of the Cabinet by keep-
Ing Chamberlain's resignation secret.
Chamberlain himself had announced
his resignation as Colonial Secretary to
the Cabinet. He said he never knew
what great men resigned Ministers
were until they were resigned and that
he believed there was no feeling on
either side that should strain personal
friendship. In conclusion, the Premier
paid a tribute to the Duke of Devon
shire.
The motion of adjournment was nega
tived by a vote of 237 to 172.

PEOPLE ARE SUSPICIOUS
Mrs. Kennedy said she was married
by Brigham Young, an apostle of the
church, to James Fracis Johnson, a
polygamist, since the manifesto of
1890, and that she has had two children
by that husband. The marriage was
performed in Mexico, according to the
witness, at the home of a high official
MRS. KEXXEDY A WITNESS.
"Is that what your church teaches?"
"No, sir," was the response. "What
we teach Is that Jesus Christ was de
scended through a long line of polyga
mists, through David down to Abra
ham."
With that Mr. Smith" left the stand,
having been the only witness in the five
days the hearing has progressed. The
prosecution then called Mrs. Clara Ma
bel Kennedy of Sevler County, Utah,
to the stand, who testified 'to having
been married into a plural marriage
since the manifesto of 1890. She said
the ceremony had been performed /by
an apostle of the Mormon church. Mrs.
Kennedy said she was born in Albany,
N. Y., twenty-seven years ago and
went with her parents to Utah when
she was 2 years old.
"Forty-two," was the answer; "twen
ty-one boys and twenty-one girls, and
I am proud of every one of % em:"
: The witness was asked, by Senator
Burrows if Joseph' Smith, founder of
the. Mormon church, was a poly
gamist, and .after answering affirma
tively, he said that Smith "was mar
ried to Eliza R. Snow and to Maria
Partridge. His first wife was living
with, him/when he married the second."
Senator Overman said that he had a
pamphlet saying that Jesus Christ was
a polygamist. Turning to Mr. Smith
he asked: *
SMITH IS PROUD.
Chairman Burrows inquired:
"How many children have you now,
Mr. Smith?"
WASHINGTON, March 7.â With
President Joseph F. Smith of the Mor
mon Church again on the'stand for the
defense, the second week of, the Smoot
case opened to-day before the Senate
Committee on Privileges and Elections.
Senator Dubois put into the record the
census figures for Utah taken In 1890,
to show that instead of only 3 or 4
per cent in, polygamy, as Smith had
said in reply, there were about 23!4
per; cent. of the Mormon population of
polygamous age who were living in a
state of polygamy in 1S90.
Taylor questioned the witness in
regard jjtoj the ages of several of the
children and Smith replied: "I am not
in the habit of carrying birth records
about with me."
Several questions were addressed to
the witness in regard to the , alleged
marriage of- Apostle Teasdale to a
plural wife since. the manifesto of 1890.
"And Mr. McDonald â don't you
know that he is dead?" asked Mr.
Worthington.
"No, I have not heard that," said
she.
The witness became confused sev
eral times under cross-examination
and made some contradictory state
ments, which for the most part she
corrected later when her attention
was called to them by the attorney
for the prosecution. She was un
able to give a description of /Young.
Chairman Burrows adjourned the
hearing until to-morrow with Mrs.
Kennedy still on the stand.
Senator Hoar asked the witness If
she ,had received any form" of mar
riage certificate from Apostle Young
and she reDlied that she had not.
Mr. Worthingrton took the witness
for- cross-examination and asked her
if she did not know that Brlgham
Young Is now dead.
"Yes, I heard so a few weeks ago."
Mrs. Kennedy said she lived with Mr.
Johnson about five "years, part of the
time in the. same house with the first
wife. She said she had two children by
Johnson, one of whom is now. living.
She separated from Johnson at the end
of five years and about a year after
that married a Mr. Kennedy, by whom
she had two children. Her present hus
bahd is an Episcopalian, but she re
mains In the Mormon church.
Senator Foraker questioned the wit
ness in regard to the ceremony uniting
her. and Johnson. She said she could
not remember much about it, except
that there were present Mr. .Johnson,
Brother Young and Mr. McDonald.
There was no prayer, she said, but she
remembers that she stood up and an
swered yes to the questions that were
asked her.
of the church. Her parents were Mor
mons and she was brought up in that
faith and had been taught the propriety
of the plural marriage, and, in fact,
never had known any different life un
til after her marriage. The . family
moved to Diaz, Mexico, when she was
about 4 years old, where she lived until
17 years of age, when she was married
to James Francis Johnson, who already
had one wife. Mrs. Kennedy said she
met the first wife and they had "a
slight interview" about going into the
family as a second wife. The first wife
gave her consent to the arrangement.
"Where were you married?" asked
Mr. Tayler.
"At the home of A. C. McDonald, the
counselor of the first president of the
State," said the witness.

"I had heard a lot about California
and my brother was going out to the
Philippines in the army," he v said. "I
wanted_to see him go, so when Fanny

him rob people I thought I. could get
some money and go. The , night of

OAKLAND, March 7.â Allured by
stories of California's riches and filled
with a desire to see the departure of
his Â«oldier-brother for the Philippines,
James Edgar, 16 years old, lent him
self as an accomplice in two burglaries

California. Such at least is the story
young James offers for his part in dar
ing burglaries that have bothered the
police of Salt Lake City of late. ,
James is one of five youths arrested
at Oakland within a week as they were
going to or coming from the Utah me
tropolis. The quintet captured in this
city were in two squads. The first lot
of runaways was composed of young
Edgar, Thomas Cosgrove, 18 years old,
and George. Bates, one-armed and 15
years of age. They were arrested at
Sixteenth street railroad Â¦ station on
March 2 en route home in a box car.
The" second . detachment arrived this
afternoon on a cattle train from Salt
Lake City and was comprised of Wal
ter Edgar, 15 years old; James Cousins
and Roderick Husband, 14 years old,
and the youngest of the crowd of five.

President Mitchell and Supervisor
Rowe had a clash to-day at the "meet
ing of the board over the condition of
county finances. ' '..ere has been con
siderable said of late by County Audit
or Bacon and some of the county of
ficials about a j>o5sblle deficit in the
counts' funds before the end of the
fiscal year. The matter came up at the
meeting of the board to-day, when
President MItohH! brought up the sub
ject by making a statement, in which
he said:
It has been said by some that then* would
3e a drfirit.in ihc county funds ttffore the end
>f the yÂ«arl The hoard has sivwi this raattrr
:arfful attrition and it can be paid al<so
!ut*ly that Â»wry bill contrartwl for by this
:Â©unty and" - whifh 'Trtil be contracted for be
fore the Â«>nd of the year will b*> paid In Zull
and without dtscnunt. Thi-p need be no fear
jpon the part of any one doing business with
this county that lie will not Rtt hit money.
Supervisor Rone took issue with this
statement and made a reply, saying:
I wast to Â«ay In rÂ«-ply that there is a
deficit in- the county general and the county
infirmary funds. ThÂ«?ro is aixmt $3". 00ft left
in the prnrral Inr-A and about $11,000 la the
infirmary fund* after t\\ claims and bills now
Drdtred are deducted. anÂ«1 upon tht'se amounts
Â«e will have to run the general county and
the infirmary for ;our months. Our chairman
does not *ay that thor<; 1Â« no deficit. He Tnerely
say* that the bills will be paid. They probably
will be paid, but only by borrowing from, next
Â»ear'p fund* in an iilfgal manner.
It is proposed to Ixjrrow rrom the foothill
boulevard road fund and the San Ar.tone Val
iey road fund money by which the deficits
!n the county Rrnrral and the cuonty infirmary
fund* cÂ«n be mÂ«-t. It has been promised in
return that out of next year's money enough
Â¦ash will be turned into these funds to make
jp what i* tying taken out this year. This is
merely a subterfupe. and it ia In reality t&klne
fncney out of next year's income to rr.nke up
for the extravagance, of th!Â« year.
Supervisor Horncr, who controls the
San Antone Valley road fund, from
which it is proposed to borrow the
available balance, remarked that this
custom was usual, and if money was
not spent this year in one or two funds
there was r.o reason why it should be
carried over into the next year. The
matter closed without any action.

"The Oakland Transit Consolidated
does not believe these franchises are
worth more than $7500 and will bid no
more."
The formal award was then made to
MacDonald, who was given until to
morrow night to pay over the balance
of $7500 due on his bid. Neither at
torney Shaw nor his client, who is a
prominent realty broker of this city,
would make any definite statements
concerning the reasons they had for
giving battle to the Transit company.
MacDonald, is now the nominal holder
of two other street railway franchises,
one of which is known as the "Cork
screw" franchise. This starts from
First and Washington streets and
criss-crosses the Oakland Transit^ lines
up Broadway and Washington street
to Fourteenth, out Webster and across
Adams Point. MacDonald also holds
a franchise to a line through a portion
of the Pleasant Valley district In .Pied
mont. None of the franchises he
bought to-night has a direct connec
tion with either the "Corkscrew" or
the Pleasant Valley franchises, al
though they might be connected.
Attorney Shaw said: "We are not
prepared at this time to say anything
about our plans. It is sufficient now
that we have bought the franchises."
MacDonald Bald: "I am not at lib
erty to talk- It might be that a new
electrfc road could be run out Webster
Btreet."
Attorney Engs said: "The Oakland
TranFit ' Company desired these fran
chises as a part of its system. We
were pot willing to bid more than $7500
for them. I know nothing about the
other people and will not discuss that
matter." ' ' \
The Council, by a vote of 7 to 4,
voted down Councilman Fitzgerald's
resolution directing City Engineer Tur
ner to make a secret valuation of the
Contra Costa' Water Company's plant,
to be used only In the event of failure
of the proposed arbitration board to
reach a satisfactory figure. It was pro
posed that the Turner valuation should
be placed in a sealed envelope, pending
the' arbitration. CuVellier refused to
m;f ke a motion to lay over the resolu
tion two weeks longer, claiming that it
was an attempt to put the Council on
record and he was ready then to go on
record.
The vote was as follows: AyesâAit
ken, Baccus, Fitzgerald. Me Adam; noes
â Cuvellier,- Elliott, Howard, Meese,
Pendleton, Wallace, ; Dornin. :â¢" '

"On behalf of J. H. MacDonald, I
raise the Oakland Transit Consoll
dated's bid to 52000." Shaw deposited
two certified checks for 5500 each with
the City Clerk, covering at least 10
pr-r cent of the amount of the bid, and
indicating that he was prepared to go
to $10,000, anyway. Attorney Edward
W. Engs, representing the Transit
Company, said:
"This opposition to our bid Is unex
pected, and I would ask the Council
for a brief continuance until I can find
out how far our people, are willing to
go"
: He was given a. half hour. Xhiring
that time Engs was busy conferring
by telephone with the Transit Company
officials and was making a ' hurried
canvass for money. From every possir
ble available source his friends raised
coin, that he might be able to continue
the fight. Engs reopened the contest
with a raise to $3000. MacDonald sent
it up $1000. The Transit Company
chipped to $4500. MacDonald came
back with $5000. Another $500-raise
from the Trahslt Company was met by
a $1000 advance from MacDonald, the
figure then "being $6500. Attorney Engs
sought another conference wiÂ£h his
principals and shortly returned with a
$7500 bid. .
MacDonald called $S500 and again the
Oakland Transit man went to the tele
phone. Returning, he said:
The Oakland Transit Company's bid
of 51500 was opened and read by the
clerk, and President Dornin.aa required
l>y law, asked if there was any one
present who -would raise the bid 10 per
cent. Then the battle began. Attorney
George M. Shaw, sitting next to Mac-
Donald, rose and said:
The franchises were three innumber,
for which original application had been
made by the Transit Company. to con
nect and straighten out parts of their
system and ; forming a part of their
general scheme of reconstruction of the
Consolidated street railroad lines of the
city in connection with the new Key
Route. ferry. Fystem. The first was for
a line running south from the Berkeley
town line on College avenue and Broad
way, connecting at Fortieth street with
the ferry system tracks. The second
and third franchises combine to form
a new connection in the East Oakland
system. These start from First avenue
and East ' Twelfth street, running
northeasterly to Third avenue and East
Eighteenth street, thence â¢ to Fourth
avenue and East Eighteenth street, out
Fourth avenue to Newton avenue and
there connecting with the old Trestle
Glen road. This new connection would
form a link in the belt line of the Tran
sit Company to connect East Oakland
by way of Piedmont with the new ferry
system line, which is designed to be
operated through Fortieth street and
eastward into the Piedmont district.

Some of the retailers who have signed
the union agreement sent for Frank
Fennon of Livermore to-day and csked
him if he could supply them with
enough meat to- serve their customers,
but Fennon said that he had only
enough meat to supply his own market,
and while there is plenty ol^cattle on
the ranges at this time of the year
they are too thin to kill.

sible to secure meat enough to supply
his customers and has been compelled
to close his market and put up a sign,
"Meat all sold out." Nevin filled his
last order this morning. He says he
can secure plenty of cattle on the hoof,
but as he has no means of killing and
dressing thern he cannot continue to
keep open.

"If a fruit grower should make the
mistake of placing an order for a num
ber of refrigerators he would be re
fused the use of the private line cars
and after he succeeded in getting his
equipment he would still be short of
icing facilities along the lines of rail
road, and through their great influ
ence with the Western roads the pack
ers would see to It that his cars were
delayed in transit and that no- Icing
stations were established," says the
gentleman.
"The Western railroads are not anx
ious to enter into a fight against the
private line owners because they are
getting their regular rate of freight
out of the shipments and if Swift and
Armour pulled off their equipment the
railroads would be without anything
to haul the fruit in and consequently
wtruld be out their freight for a couple
of years whlle-they were petting equip
ment built to handle it."
Two years ago the Atchlson gave it
out that contracts with the private car
lines would not be Â¦ renewed by that
road, but when the matter was laid
before the Atchison officials in the
proper manner by the representatives
of the private lines the management
soon retracted the statement and the
contract was again renewed by the
Atchlson with the contingent privilege
of a renewal for two years longer when
the contract ran out, provided the pri
vate car lines wished such renewal. -
The income from these private car
lines may be estimated in a rough way
when it is stated that owns
at present about 18,000 cars and Swift
about 8000. The Cudahy Packing Com
pany in South Omaha has about 1000.
It requires about thirty days for one
of these cars to make the round trip
from California to Chicago. This year
It is estimated there will be 30,000 cars
of oranges shipped from California to
the East, all of which will go in Swift
and Armour cars, with possibly a few
exceptions. This is of oranges alone
and does not include several thousand
cars of other 'fruits, which probably
will bring the total up to over 60,000
cars. Every orange or plum eaten In
the East pays tribute to these two
packers.
But it is said that this great "graft"
of modern business is about to enter
upon a decline. It has been called to
the attention of Messrs. Harriman, Hill
and Morgan by their; faithful lieuten
ant, Midgley, and it is believed they
have decided they need the money and
will devise ways and means to get it,
or a portion of it at least.
But it is asked, "Why don't the fruit
shippers build a car line of their own?"
The reason is given that It would re
quire all the car shops which are equip
ped for building refrigerators two or
three years to turn out a sufficient
number of cars in addition to their
other business to handle the fruit busi
ness from the coast.
MONOPOLY IS INTRENCHED.
In icing transcontinental shipments
for other packers, which shipments
consist of beef and other meats going
from Chicago to the Pacific Coast,
Armour and Swift charge competitors
in the packing business $15 per car for
the service, which is $75 less than the
fruit shipper pays for the same service.
known as the refrigeration charge,
which amounts to $90 per car from Cal
ifornia to Chicago, and $115 per car if
the shipment goes east of Chicago. This
refrigeration charge is for icing and
caring for Ehipment of fruit while on
Its long journey to the East. The fruit
shippers have been trying for years to
get these private car line owners to re
duce the refrigeration charge, but they
have steadily refused tÂ«j' make any re
duction, saying the charge was as low
as they could handle the business.
The recommendation also Is made
that when lands are restored to entry
after temporary segregation ample time
should be allowed homesteaders to ex
ercise their rights, giving them the
preference over persons who may wish
to select the land by the use of scrip
or other form of entry.
The committee also recommends the
repeal of the law permitting assign
ment of entries under the desert land
law and urges the Importance of a more
careful administration of law, especially
to those provisions relating to obtain
ing an adequate permanent water sup
ply. It advocates the restricting of the
commutation clause of the homestead
entry act, where such entries are lo
cated within forest reserves, or where
the land is chiefly valuable for timber.
It suggests the outlines for a law per
mitting homestead entries upon agri
cultural land within forest reserves and
the survey and description of such ag
ricultural lands by metes and bounds,
rather than by the regular system, thus
permitting the agricultural lands to be
selected along the valleys and to em
brace the good tillable land without
taking in extensive tracts of sidehlll.
WASHINGTON, March 7.â The com
mission appointed October 12, 1903. by
the President, 1 consisting of <W. A. Rich
ards, Commissioner of the General
Land Office; Glfford Pinchot, chief
forester of the Department of Agricul
ture, and F. H. 'Newell, chief engineer
of the ' reclamation service, to make
suggestions regarding revision of the
laws relating to public lands, has made
a partial report to the President, which
was sent to Congress to-day. It recom
mends the repeal of the tlmbsr and
stone act and the substitution of suit
able provisions for selling, after ap
praisal, the timber on public lands that
Is needed in large or small quantities
for industrial purposes.
At the St. i/ouls convention all theÂ«Â« sub
jects will be carefully considered and very
likely important legislation in the various
States will follow. . Kvery Stats and Territory
will be represented at thia convention, and we
hope for a large representation from the for
eign countries, of which thirty-three have
been Invited to participate. Belgium. Austria
and Germany ha\e already accepted and we
have received nssuranc? of representatives
from IndJA, where, by the way. notwithstand
ing the fact that we are annually sending
large sums of niorwy to that country for mis
sionary purposes, they have 000 miles of th*
finest roada In the world. Good roads mean
the future salvation of the whole country, and
California needs many miles of them. The
Government is rendering ouV association great
aid, not: In a direct way, but in the way of
co-operation. In the fifty-ninth session .of
Congress we expect to have a bill Introduced
providing for financial assistance for the asso
ciation: Its legislation in favor of free rural
mail delivery "has done much to stimulate pub
lic sentiment in reference to good roads, for
one of the conditions demanded by the Gvern
ment Ib that the districts In which this service
Is Â¦InstelU'd phall contain, at least twenty-f!vÂ»
miles of road, adjacent to not less than 100
families-, and that the roads shall !>:Â¦ of a
nature to. permit travel nil the year roond.
An appropriation for rural mall delivery now
under consideration provides for $25,000,000 for
a district a million miles square, In which arÂ»
estimated to b* about 42,000,000 people. , -
President Moore will *Â¦ confer with
representatives of the . local commer
cial bodies this morning regarding the
holding. of the State convention in. this
city and he will return to Los Angeles
to-morrow, and from there will an
nounce his choice between that : and
this city as a meeting place for the
convention. The: railroad officials yes
terday, expressed the opinion that San
Francisco Is the more preferable, and
President Moore said last. evening that
he was of the same opinion. â¢
GOVERNMENT IS ASSISTING.
The third measure to be discussed at the
convention provides lor State legislation that
will take convicts out of contract labor and
permit their services to be applied almost en
tirely to the improvement ot highways. 1 There
are at present in the Jails of our country, ac
cording to our latest statistics. S4.000 con
victs., of which between 42.C0O and 45.000 are
able-bodied men. whose labor can be utilized
to a great advantage. Those' interested in the
roads movement believe that the labor
of all convicts, together with' that of the va
grant and pauper class, should be utilized by
the States In which they are serving: terms of
Imprisonment or receivlnc aid. The records
will show you that in the United States there
is being spent annually in promiscuous charity
more than $100,000,000. Last year there were
arrested !n this country 087.000 persons
charged with criminal offenses and the cost
of handlins them was ?7S,OO0.000. The (rood
roads people figure that a large proportion of
this tremendous expense could he raved, . or
recovered. If every ! State would adopt and
rigidly enforce the vagrancy law. such as Is
now operative In Â«e\ f eral States.
FAVORS CONVICT LABOR.
It was explained by President Moore
that the idea is to have, at the national
convention, all the States and Terri
tories unite on various lines of legisla
tion for, the promotion of the good
roads projects in the future. In thirty
two States, . not including California,
good roads organizations already exist
andahe hope of the national body is
to soon have the other States in line.
Next year the Legislatures in thirty
eight States will hold sessions, and the
plan is to., have, them all adopt the
same measures relating to good roads.
President Moore continued:
At the St. Louis convention there will be
three Important measures specially considered.
One is lor the appointment in every State of a
hi~hway commission, K similar ; to , the one . in
thTs State, which wiir have the supervision or
the construction of roads and their mainte
nance. A second measure will be the adop
tion by all States of, what !Â» commonly known
as a '"'StÂ»tÂ« aid bill,", under which the Stata
Joins with the county and the property owner
whose land lies contiguous to the lines of the
proposed roads in paying the expenses of the
construction work. Under this plan Massa
chusetts has built already more than 700 miles
of roads and New York State has spent in the
same way more than $2,000,000, while Penn
sylvania has approÂ»rlated $6.&00.000 to be used
for road construction in three 1 ; years.
W. H. Moore, president of the Na
tional Good Roads Association, arrived
from Los Angeles yesterday , : is
registered at the Palace Hotel. He. has
come to this city in connection; with
the proposed State convention, to' be
held either in Los or San
Francisco between 'April 12 and 15, pre
liminary to the national and interna
tional good roads convention to be held
in St. Louis in May, 1905.
".We hope to have the people of Cali
fornia represented at the State con
vention by between 2500 and 3000 dele
gates," said he* last evening. "The
Governor will\ be asked to name one
delegate from each county and a cer
tain, number of delegates at large. The
commercial bodies of each city will also
be represented by from three |to five
delegates, and the Mayors of the cities
and towns and the various railroad
companies will likewise send repre
sentatives to the meeting. To-day I
was in conference with Mr. McCormick
of the Southern Pacific Company-and
Mr. Bissell of the Santa Fe road, both
of whom gave me assurance of their
hearty support of the undertaking and
promised the delegates -the cheapest
possible rate. The main purpose of
this convention at this particular time
is to get the State in line, for she has
been a bit backward in this matter,
and have her \ people select delegates
to the big convention to be held in St.
Louis next year."
NATIONAL CONVENTION.
Without completing the reading of
the bill the Senate at 5:24 o'clock went
Into executive session and adjourned
at 5:2S p. m.
Teller, who had started the discus
sion, replied that it would not be fair
to use the Porto Ricans for a duty
considered too hazardous for native
Americans. At the request of Spooner
the amendment was passed over for
further consideration.
The bill was (hen passed and the
army appropriation bill taken up.
While the bill was being read for the
committee amendments there was a
discussion of the usefulness' of the pro
visional regiment of infantry in Porto
Rico. Messrs. Foraker and Quarles said
that the committee had considered that
the Porto Rlcans, being acclimated, had
been especially fitted for service on the
isthmus of Panama. i
Patterson said that while he did n,ot
believe in holding the Philippines he
was of the opinion that the majority
of the people was against him . and
that therefore the day was far dis
tant when the people of that archipel
ago would be given freedom. Â¦
Teller said the United States should
have a navy adequate to the protec
tion "of our national interests, but he
failed to see the urgent' need of the
extensive additions, and expressed the
opinion that no more -ships should be
ordered until we completed those in
process of construction.
Bacon did not accept the view of
Patterson as to the retention of the
Philippines, saying that he hoped the
conscience of the American people
would be aroused over the injustice of
the present situation.
Allison said that the appropriation
for armor and armament in the pend
ing bill did not apply to the ships
authorized by the bill, but was a gen
eral provision applying to vessels al
ready authorized.
Patterson said he had no disposition
to interfere with the provision for arm
or for the ships now building, and
he withdrew his amendment "and subr
stituted another in the language of
the naval appropriation act of 1900, pro
viding that if armor could not be se
cured at just and reasonable rates the
Government should erect an armor fac
tory at a cost not to exceed $4,000,000.
On motion of Hale the amendment was
laid on the table.
Patterson then moved amendments
limiting the price to be paid for armor
to $400 per ton, prohibiting purchase of
armor from trusts and fixing an eight
hour day for work on the armor pro
vided for.' All of them were laid on
the table.
WASHINGTON, March 7.â The Sen
ate to-day passed the naval appropria
tion bill, which has been before it for
the last four or five days, and then took
up the army bill. The principal ques
tion debated in connection with the
naval bill related to the price and
method* of supplying armor plate for
battleships, and it grew out of an
amendment suggested by Mr.'Patter
son providing for a Government armor
plant. He ultimately withdrew the
amendment, but offered several others,
all of which were laid on the table.
The reading of the army appropria
tion bill had not been concluded^when
the Senate adjourned..- . * r; \ _
In speaking of the continued growth
of the navy, Patterson said the com
pletion of the naval programme would
place the United States ahead of Ger
many and Russia in actual tonnage
and ahead of France and next to Great
Britain in effective fighting tonnage.
"And my judgment," he continued,
"is that American sentiment will not
permit the United States at any time
in the future to fall behind in naval
power any nation that it has passed.
American sentiment not only will jus
tify but it will require the United
States to continue second to Great Brit
ain."
owner from $723 to 51123. according to
the state of the material market when
the cars were contracted for. He has
been adding to his equipmnt year by
year, consequently the variation in the
cost per car. Figuring the average cost
at $1000. which is tjuite high, it will
bo. seen that this private line is paying
about 30 per cent on the investment.
These figures will apply as well to
all private lines in the country. These
facts are known to the owners of rail
roads, hence their interest in the mat
ter. c
The above figures are easy, however,
when compared to those of the earnings
of the transcontinental fruit lines. Two
packers, Swift and Armour, own prac
tically all the fruit refrigerators in this
country. All the fruit hauled from Cal
ifornia to the East is loaded in these
cars and the cars are operated under
contracts with the "Western railroads.
For the use of one of these cars id
hauling a load of fruit from California
to Chicago the owner of the car re
ceives from the railroad over which it
I asses 1 cent per mile in most cases,
but never less than three-quarters of a
cent The rate is paid both ways by
the railroads and amounts for the round
trip from California to Chicago to
about $50 per car. In addition to this
the shipper of the fruit pays what is
The net income of one of the great
Chicago packers from his refrigerator
line is, on an average, about $25 per
car per month. This would make the
net income for each car per year $300.
Of course the monthly income varies
according to the number of miles
traveled by the car, but it ranges from
as low as $17 to as high as $45, and the
average monthly for the whole num
ber of cars, about 1000, would be about
5"5. These cars when new cost the
KXRICIUXG THE PACKERS.
For instance, if a car is loaded from
Omaha to New York with beef, the
railroads over which it travels pay
three-quarters of a cent for every mile
it runs to New York and the same rate
on the return trip. Owing to the fact
that the car must be returned to the
shipper in Omaha without delay, it is
rarely loaded upon the return trip,
and therefore the company realizes no
freight charges, consequently the roads
over which it is returned are in the
position of paying mileage on an empty
car, which is in addition to the expense
of hauling it.
Now, it is figured that if the rail
roads owned their own refrigerator
equipment, this 'return mileage would
be saved to them, and in addition to
that, the loaded mileage could be cut
d^xvn to a great extent. In fact, the
mileap^ which is paid by one road to
another is not nearly so hi?h as that
paid to owners of beef trust cars. It
has been said that the railroads do
not desire a change In the plan of
hauling and paying for private equip
ment, for the reason that it is a very
safe way in which to make rebates
of freight to heavy shippers and at the
bame time make these rebates appear
lawful. But it is understood that un
der the surface the leading railroad
men of the East are quietly gathering
data with which to confront the pri
vate car line owners in the near future,
this data, to be used as an argument
why the rates now liaid ehould be low
ered.
OMAHA. Nebr., Feb. 29.â The name
of J. "W. Midgley of Chicago Is one
to conjure with among the owners of
private car lines. Midgley for some
time has been conducting what Is
termed a car mileage bureau, and It
has been his business to inquire into
the methods of operating these lines
by what is commonly termed the "beef
trust." Midgley is said to be in the
employ of E. H. Harriman. J. J. Hill
and J. P. Morgan, and his duties are
to shov.' these gentlemen various ways
ja which expenses of conducting their
railways can be reduced.
It has long been known among rail
road men that the private car line is
one of the greatest "grafts" known to
the railroad world for transferring the
funds of the roads to the pockets of
the beef mist. A number of these
lines are in existence, and the income
from them is enormous. The owners
of these private lines get what is term
ed mileage for the use of the equip
ment. This mileage amounts to three
yuai ters of a cent per mile on freezers,
or first-class beef cars. A number of
the Western loads pay as high as 1
cent per mile on freezers â that is, these
rates are paid for each mile the car
runs both ways over the lines of the
various companies, and is paid by the
Industrial company over whose line the
car travels.

Schools in Russia.
In Russia altogether there are , about
85,000 elementary schools, the total co&t
of their maintenance being 50.000.COO
rubles, or about $27,000,000.' Of this
amount the Zemstvos, or provincial as
semblies, which contain representatives
of the peasantry, contribute 23 per cent
and they exist and operate in less than
half the provinces of the empire. The
imperial treasury contributes 20 per
cent and the rest is 'made up by ap
propriations of the rural and municipal
governments, and by gifts, bequests and
other incidental contributions. There
are 4.500.000 pupils in all the schools
only a quarter of them being girls. Of
the. female population of the empire
only one in fifty-four appears as a
pupil; of the males, about one In twen

have to walk from eight to twelve miles

in the controland' management of these
A MOVEMENT has been started in the East to- hold
a grand reunion of veterans of the Union and Con
federate armies at St. Louis during the coming
summer. The suggestion, which appears to have : been
first made by the Tribune of Middletown, Connecticut;
was at once taken up by'Rev. Henry .^Byrcms. of New
Smyrna, Florida, and through his efforts conside?able
support has been brought to the, enterprise. 1
In commenting on the movement Admiral Schley says:
"The. time came long since when the people everywhere
appreciate the true men of 1861-65 on both sides, who in
their struggle developed the highest and -best manhood.
The battlefields on which they contended are legacies ; of
value to the nation and should ' be preserved " as sacred
places in our land." Senator Hawley, Senator Hoar;
General H. V. Boynton and Colonel. C. ! H.Upham are
among the prominent me'n who have given indorsement
to the project. â¢ .
In a letter explaining the movement, Mr. Byrons says:
"Let it be understood that this movement is not forVpo
litical effect. It. is not in the interest of any one indi
vidual or party. It simply stands for what is due every
soldier of the Civil Warâ whether he fought under f the
BLUE AND GRAY REUNION.
CASINOâ A. T. Y. S., City. In play
ing the game of casino persons playing
should always agree as to the manner
of counting before the game com
mences. Players may agree to count ar.
they make points, or may agree to
count at the end of the play. If on ttv*
last play the count Is according to th--'
first suggestion, a player goes out aa
soon as. he has made the necessary
points to complete the game, which ac
cording to the letter < of Inquiry wa3
twenty-one. If the count Is at the enl
of the game the same is in the follow
ing order: Cards, big casino, little'ca
sino, spades, aces and sweeps; the one
holding cards haying the right to count
first; if cards are equal, then the one
holding big casino counts first. If a
game* is twenty-one and the player, say
A, has sixteen and five to go, makes
cards, spades and one ace, and B has
seventeen and four to go, and he makes
big and little casino and three aces,
which would give him twenty-three
points to his opponent's twenty-one, his
opponent wins, because he has the first
count by reason of cards and lias
enough points to make hirri go out.
â¢Jeffries and -Monroe have decided that the people of
San Francisco will pay at least $25,000 to see them fight,
so the match is made, the terms settled and only the dol
lars of our- gudgeons are- to be paid. We would not
raise that sum of money with which to insure an ex
hibit representative of the city at St. Louis. It has been
left to the bruising pluguglies of the prize ring to t prove
that you can fool all the people all the time.
Under the storm and stress 'of war Russia, it is said,
is threatened by the torch, of revolution. It would :be
wise for the rebellious spirits to remember, however,
that if the Bear is slow to avenge foreign aggression he
is a wonder in preserving peace at home. Russian
authority knows no compromise in the severity with
which it punishes domestic unrest.
CRIBBAGEâ Constant Reader, City.
If in a game of cribbage the play is:
A, 7; B, 8; A, 9; A has a sequence of
three'; if B plays a six he has a se
quence of four and one for last play.
If the play is 7, 8, 6, there is a run of
three. It makes no difference how the
cards fall so long in the play they
count In sequence.
On the score of economy, the experting of municipal
accounts designed to prevent fraud and detect any that
has been committed will cease. There seems to be
something of merit in this winter housing and muzzling

"SAN FRANCISCO, March 8, 1904.
"Editor of The Callâ Dear Sir: In
The Call of the 4th is a communica
tion from W. H. Leonard regarding Mr.
George and the Citizens' Alliance, in
which He misrepresents the labor con
ditions in Colorado. What he says
about industrial war, paralyzed indus
tries, the smelting and ore mining oc
cupations being tied up, business
houses closing their doors, etc., would
have been correct descriptions of con
ditions a few months ago, when the
Western Federation of Miners ruled
and came near ruining much of the
State. They are not correct descrip
tions of the present conditions.
"Cripple Creek, the storm center of
the late industrial war, was never more
prosperous than at present. Its gold
production In January is reported to
have been greater than during any
preceding month in the camp's history;
Its mines are working full handed, and
the only stores which I have^heard of
closing their doors are those estab
lished by the Federation of Miners,
"Tellurlde, the second gold produc
ing camp of the State, is in a more
prosperous and peaceable condition
than for years. It has long been ter
rorized by the federation. Somewhere
near a score of men- have been killed
there solely because they were non
union men and others have disappeared
never to be heard of again by family
or friends.
"The smelters have fired their Idle
furnaces and* the mills, samplers and
railroads are doing a good business.
For the first time in years unionism is
not being propagated with violence or
fear.
"This change Is due to the Citizens'
in which Mr. George was the
'earliest and most effective worker.
"W. C. WYNKOOP."
London Vulnerable.
A London paper publishes the start
ling word of a military expert to the
effect that on enemy could walk Into
London as easily as rolling off a lcrg.
"Admiral Close," says the Times,
"who took part In the subsequent dis
cussion, said he was astonished, at the
want of proper defenses in the Thames.
If- Germany declared war on Monday
they could have a couple of gunboats
up the river to the middle of Lon
don by the next night. London would
never be safe until they had a coup'e
of gunboats stationed In the river. Any
gunboat could get past Sheerness. and
there would be nothing to stop them
except a few police boats. These in
vading vessels could inflict any amount
rf damage. They might destroy the
houses of Parliament and the Tower
and they would play havoc with tha
shipping. The danger was not realized
by the public and until it was London
would never be safe."
By Authority.
There was quite a warm discussion
in one of the parlors of the Native
Daughters a few nights since, and, as
there were two factions, each with a
strong array of supporters, there was
crimination and recrimination. Fin
ally one of the speakers called atten
tion to a decision that had been made
by one of the grand presidents and
made the assertion that in that order
a' decision by a grand president is the
law until it is set aside by the Grand
Parlor.
Some one on the other side asked
under what power the grand presi
dent had made such a ruling and the
first speaker responded sententiously,
"ex cathedra."
The one who* Jiad asked the ques
tion, before the first speaker could say
another word, sprang to her feet and
In a loud voice exclaimed, "Worthy
president, the sister ought to know
that religious matters cannot . be
brought up in the parlor and I hope
you will call her to order."
The first speaker continuing 1 , said
that her dear sister, must have misun
derstood what she said, but that it was
her'way of briefly announcing that the
grand president had acted by author
ity.
The interrupter simply said, "Oh, I
thought the sister was about to quote
the law of some cathedral and I want
ed to stop it right at the beginning."
IN the Prussian Diet a demand is made for lower
freight rates on the government roads. In the dis
cussion rates in the United States were used as an
example. Freight rates in' Germany are something more
than twice the rates in this country, and in all Europe,
including the British Isles, the average is twice our rate.
\.-Vo.n Rheinbaben, the Finance Minister, replied to the
interpellation on the' subject that where American
roads had no competition .their rates were higher, and
that passenger rates in the United States are double the
Prussian rate. An examination of conditions in this
0 - - " -....-.
country would disclose to the Minister certain errors.
Not much railway mileage in this country is non-com
petitiveA Where no competition exists it will be found
that the line is new, projected into partially developed
country, and the rates are a reduction on the pre-exist
ing wagon haul rate of freight.
The history of American freight rates shows a pro
gressive decline as tonnage has increased with in
ereased production. When transportation has sufficient
ly stimulated production and the business has risen to
a volume to invite competition, it has everywhere ap
peared, until we have the cheapest rail transportation in
the world. During the discussion in the Diet this cheap
ness was recognized as 3 prime cause of our economical
production, and representatives of the German manu
facturing interests demanded a like advantage. The
German roads, however, are run for profit, and the Fi
nance Minister pointed out that 54 per cent of Ameri
ican roads pay no dividends, and that the average divi
dend of our roads is only 2 per cent per annum.
Â¦As to passenger rates in this country, we are of
opinion that the Minister is mistaken. When speed and
accommodations are taken into account it is not prob
able that our passenger rate is twice that of Germany.
He made use of it, however, by asking that the German
rate be raised and made a decline in freight rate con
tingent on such raise. \
The discussion and its comparisons and disclosures
shed much light upon the proposition that the Govern
ment take over and operate American roads. If it
do this for profit there must be such an increase in rates
as will get dividends out. of the 54 per cent of roads
that pay none now, and as will raise the low
dividend returned by * the remaining 46 per cent.
If operating the roads v pay no direct dividend,
but net a loss, it will- have to be made up by the
taxpayers, as in the case of the postoffice deficit. Under
the German bureaucratic government .the government
roads are made to pay dividends by exacting rates nruch
higher than ours, and when lower freights are asked they
are offered only upon condition that the deficit in the
freight department be put upon the passenger depart
ment, in higher rates for travel. C
It is plain that Americans would gain nothing by
government ownership of transportation, while the Gov
ernment would lose in efficiency by assuming the new
function. Already our Government is too much burdened
and its business is getting beyond the. possibility of that
exact oversight that is- possible in private affairs. To
load it further will be a mistake, easy to make and hard
to correct.
GERMAN TRANSPORTATION.
Her Teeth.
The Russian Railway Company from
which Mme. Larkisowa, an operatic
singer of St. Petersburg, has recovered
damages for the loss of five front teeth,
has by now discovered that It enter
tained an angel unawares. The song
stress was in a slight collision, and,
being thrown against the door of the
carriage, lost the aforesaid teeth. Her
misfortune Impaired the quality of her
voice, and she claimed Â£20.000 damages.
The railway company, with a fidelity
to the traditions df the service, offered
her Â£20, and the courts have awarded
her Â£10,000. That the company should
be appealing surprises no one more
than that the lady should have scorned
their suggested solatium aa an insult
added to injury. Singers' teeth are
valuable property, and railway com
panies must take their chance when
carrying such precious freight. But
whether an insurance coupon should
not be purchased by travelers of this
valuable kind seems a moot point in
equity, if not in law. It might be
worth the companies' while to register
them, like "letters containing coin." and
so forth.â London St. James Ga
zette.
The recently appojnted authorities of our emergency
hospitals have, most unexpectedly, decided to answer
one of the most persistently asked questions of the com
munity. The city doctors declare that they will assume
responsibility for the conduct of every case submitted
to hospital treatment. We will be able to tell now at
least who is to blame.

â¢ Author of "Asiatic I!uÂ«3ia," <te.)
oinrlirht. liW't. by Joseph B. Bowies.)
In the spring of 1900, in company with
Frederick B. Wright. I set out for a
trip acrocs Siberia in the Interest of
certain scientific investigations. In the
course of the season we were brought in
very Pleasant contact with a consid
erable number of the Russian leaders
who are now prominent in the affairs
connected with the war between Russia
and Japan. A brief description of our
impressions may add something; to the
interest with which all are following
the I'rojjress of events in the Far EasL
While spending a few weeks on our
way in Japan Baron Rosen, the Rus
sian Emhapyador at Tc.kio. learning of
my plans, pent word through Minister
Buck that he would be hnppy to have
an interview with u?. Upon the follow
ing day, through the good offices of our
Minister, we were taken over to the
Uaron's residence, and were most cor
dially received by a woli-preserved man
somewhat :>ast middle life, who spoke
English fluently and expressed great
Interest in America and wide knowl
edge of the affairs upon this conti
nent. His interest in scientific investi
gations was also shown by his plaus
ible explanation of various phenomena
which he had witnessed in America,
and further by his desire and willing
ness to further cur iilans. and it was
for this that he had requested an audi
ence. He advised us by all means not
to follow the mere beaten track of
tourists, but to begin our explorations
by making a trip through Manchuria
elong the line of the railroad which
hiÂ« Government was constructing. To
facilitate this he offered to write a
personal letter of introduction to Ad
miral Alexieff at Port Arthur and
Colonel Samoytoff at Khabarovsk. This
he did in th*> characteristic cordial and
perfect style of Russian officials, and
expressed most hearty wishes for our
fcucccss. .--Â¦;.-'
Armed with Baron Rosen's letter
of introduction we appeared at Port
Arthur in the early part of June,
1900, about t?n days after the break-
Ing out of the Boxer revolution at
Peking, and sought an interview with
Admiral Alexieff. He was then the
ranking commander of .ill the foreign
forces in the East and was giving gen
eral direction to the armies which
were g-atherir.g about Peking. Our
first ulimj'So of the admiral was ob
tained at the little Russian church at
Port Arthur, where I attended ser
vice with a crowd of Cossacks. On
the following day he was to have his
weekly public reception. To this we
repaired, hoping for an opportunity
to present our letter. But the pres-
Fure of responsibilities was such that
he did not appear. Nothing daunted,
we proceeded to the official headquar
ters the next day and presented the
letter. But the subordinate officials
were slow of movement and we seem
ed likely to fail of our object, when
we learned that Colonel Samoytoff of
the general staff had just been trans
ferred to Port Arthur and on the
presentation of our letter to him we
were put under charge of a Cossack
and taken over to the colonel's quar
ters.
Baron Rosen had commended him
to us as a man who was deeply inter
ested in the work of the Imperial
Geographical Society and so we found
him to be. He also spoke English
readily and entered into our plans
with great zest, and offered to bring
our letters to the notice of the ad
miral, assuring us that if we would
go over to our hotel we should in due
time receive an invitation for an in
terview. In the course of a few hours
a Cossack appeared with a polite note
from Admiral Alexieff asking us to
have a private interview with him at
10 o'clock the next day. With as lit
tle "formality as possible he received
us and chatted about affairs in
America and about the object of our
investigations, in which he appeared
to have much interest. It is a strik
ing commentary upon the failure of
the European powers to understand
the extent of the Boxer movement at
that time that though the revoluion
had then been going on for two weeks
Admiral Alexieff had no hesitation in
sending us through Manchuria along
the line of the partially constructed
railroad, where apparently he appre
hended that there would be no danger
besetting us.
Admiral AlexiefT is of a little more
than medium height, somewhat thick
set. but not portly, with a winning
Uussian face. He dispatches business
with great rapidity and displays a
very wide knowledge of the world as
veil as of his own country. He has
come up from humble position and
now so commands the confidence of
the Russian people and of the Czar
that he is given unlimited authority
In the conduct of negotiations with
Japan and of the war and of the gov
ernment of the provinces of Eastern
Siberia. Z'Zt?
In due time a Cossack armed with a
letter from Admiral Alexieff took us
in charge and conducted us to the
general superintendent of the railroad,
whom we had found it impossible to
approach the day before. But he now
received us with great cordiality v and
many expressions of interest in our
success! and put us on board a con
struction train, where, crowded into a
caboose car, with numerous subordi
nate officials .and workmen, we spent
four days in going over the line from
Port Arthur -to Teling, near Mukden,
elementary schools, and they come un
der the direction of nine different de
partments. Some are secular and some
religious, but none are equipped as they
should be and as they might be under
more efficient administration; though
there is not money enough available
from public or private sources to carry
on the business as it ought to bÂ« car*
Laugh on the Chaplain.
General Jubal Early, who- holds a
high place In the hearts of all former
Confederate soldiers, was famous for
his love of a good iest, and many a
witty thing 'said by him is retold when
ever Southern veterans get together.
Early was a broad minded, reverent
man at heart, but he could not resist
the temptation sometimes ta "Josh" his
friends about things they held most
sacred. One of his intimates who had
to suffer on this account was the cele
brated preacher and soldier, the Rev.
Dr. Robert L. Dabney, well known in
later years as a leader among the
Southern Presbyterians and the author
of many theological works.
When the war began Mr. Dabney
became chaplain to a Virginia regi
ment. Later the friendship of Stone
wall Jackson, who was a devout Pres
byterian, led to his appointment as
Jackson's chief of staff. But he still
continued to preach to the soldiers, and
being intensely patriotic and Southern
in his sympathies his sermons were
apt to be largely exhortations designed
to fire the hearts of the Confederate
rank and file.
On one of the great battlefields of
the war Early happened to ride up to
Jackson's position Just as the Yankee
cannon balls were beginning to be un
comfortably thick in the air overhead.
The members of Jackson's staff nat
urally got down pretty close to their
saddles when one of these missiles shot
screirmlng through the air. Early saw
the famous fighting parson hugging his
horse's neck.
"Well, doctor," he said, with a Â«ly
chuckle, "you don't seem to hanker
after that starry crown you have been
recommending so warmly to our boys
in butternut. Ha, ha, ha!" '-.
Of course the laugh was on the chap
lain ever after.
THE THIRD TERM.
TAMMANY again professes loyalty to Mr. Cleve
land. Whether this is a shrewd move to put Judge
Parker out of the race cannot now be known.
Tammany's alliance has always been with the South, and
if the Southern politicians and members of Congress rep
resent the sentiment of their peo"plc Mr. Cleveland will
not be accepted by that section. This makes the situa
tion look like offering to the South Cleveland or" Hearst,
as an alternative. *
The anti-third term tradition is very strong. "Ameri
cans have always feared that an emergency would be
used by a political party to make a breach in that tradi
tion, which would lead finally to continuous terms in the
Presidency, giving the office a monarchical character.
With the custom once inaugurated the vast power of the
President could be used in a variety of ways to secure
a life tenure. We have seen this done in Mexico, where
Diaz was strong enough to break a constitutional tenure
and 'make himself a permanent dictator. ;
The only organized attempt to secure a third term was
that made for Grant in 1880. It was a powerful move
ment, headed by Conkling, then the strongest of leaders.
Its purpose was stubbornly adhered to and Grant's 306
votes became historic. While this attempt was .'being
made the Democracy were alert at all points. The exam
ple of Washington was in daily use and the third term
was denounced as the substance of- imperialism. The
greatest hit in the Democratic National Convention of
that year, at Cincinnati, was the speech of Judge Hoadly.
After denouncing the seating of Hayes, he said: "But
we owe much to the fears of the Republican party. Only
fear moved it to abandon the hope of following a usurp
er with a king." Should the attempt be made now to se
cure a third term in the Presidency, the campaign litera
ture of the subject lies in the copious expressions of. the
Democracy in 1880.
Aside from this shifting of its sentiments by one
party in the country, there is a well grounded and deep
feeling against a third term. Instead of extending the
tenure of the Presidency, the feeling is rather in favor
of giving the same President only one elected term.
With the increase in the Federal officiary of the coun
try the personal power of the President has grown.
Mr. Cleveland is patriotic. He reveres institutions
and desires their preservation, and it is very doubtful
that he would lend himself to their weakening by consent
ing to extend the Presidential terms indefinitely. He ap
plauded Tilden's philosophic acceptance of , his fate after
the election of 1876. It was then in Tilden's power to
have started a revolution over the disputed Presidency.
The air was heated by party passion and the issue was
of such a nature that men would have justified them
selves in bringing on the most serious disorder. But
Tilden was impressed by the vast evils that would follow
even if he won the office by such means as many of his
partisans were willing to use.
Those evils were exactly the same, in their effect, as
those that sober-minded men have seen in the third
term, and it is hardly possible that Mr, Cleveland will
be willing to undertake such a venture, as the candidate
of Tammany. His sound and creditable position in his
country's history is now assured, but it would be lost by
a nomination for a third term, whether he win or lose
at the polls. Tammany does .not seem to understand
that Mr. Cleveland's strength is exactly of that quality
which is, part of the anti-third term idea. His partisans
are personal in their attachment, and look upon him as
the leading exponent of the old and conservative ideas
and sentiments of the country. They, would be shocked
into opposition by such a violent wrench of those ideas
Of : course Tammany represents a different element.
It is the instrument of that class which wants to win, re
gardless of the methods used to that end^or of the con
sequences to the future of the country. The motive
power of the minority in Congress is the cry against im
perialism. It has labored, ever since the close of the
Spanish war, to rouse the fear that our institutions are in
danger from something that the President may do. But
that issue. as they have put it has been repeatedly passed
upon by the people, who have decided that it is a false
issue. The final consequences of the Spanish war were
not foreseen when it began, nor are they now clearly
discernible. The attitude of the. administration has
properly been tentative, and public sentiment has re
mained tolerant but unripe.
The plight of the Democracy in a third-term campaign
would be pitiable. It has always denounced a third term
as the substance and essence of imperialism, and would
be put at once upon the defensive. The campaign would
not be long enough for it to 'regorge its 'own words and
reverse its attitude. Surely Mr. Hearst could ask noth
ing better than to appear in the convention as the cham
pion and representative of Washington's, example, and
the protagonist of the party's position on the third term.
As an alliance between him and Tammany is much more
natural than one of Tammany and Cleveland, we are of
opinion that the third-term proposition is in his interest.
which is now the scene of strife. The
distance is about 400 miles. The train
stopped at all sorts of places to un
load material, going only by daylight.
All on board were untiring in their
efforts to make it pleasant for us. We
specially owed much to a flaxen haired
boy who as a sailor had visited New
York, and so had picked up a few
English words, which served as the
p*rinclpal means of communication with
our traveling companions. He was the
servant of the architect who was on
the train inspecting and overseeing the
construction of the stations along the
line. His devotion to his master and
his untiring patience in finally getting
us started on our way after we left the
railroad are remembered with the keen
est interest.
Mr. Pocatelloff. whe-se name appears
occasionally In the prominent reviews
of the leaders of the East, was the
leading manager of the Russo-Chlnese
Dank, with its headquarters in Peking.
He, too, is a tall, well proportioned
man in middle life, who' speaks English
and various other languages readily,
and take* you Into his confidence re
specting matters In general while con
ducting his business with you. The
breaking out of the Boxer revolution
found him in Peking, where he nobly
took his part with the common laborers
In their defense.
Colonel Ghenche's name may not
often be seen in print, but you may be
assured he is filling a most important
post in the military operations that
are now in progress, for he is tlie chief
manager of all the telegraphic lines of
Manchuria and Siberia. Through the
construction of most of the telegraph
lines of the empire he has become fa
miliar with everything connected with
Asiatic Russia. At the time we met
him he made his headquarters at Tel
ing, which was then the terminus of
the road. He, like Admiral Alexieff.
Is a bachelor, his whole energies being
devoted to his country's service. We
found him boarding with a Cossack
colonel, whose good wife showed a
motherly care for us while we were
waiting to be sent on through the 200
miles of country in which the railroad
was not constructed. Like all * the
other great Russians whom we met,
Colonel Ghenche was perfectly simple
in his manners and manifested great
interest in all general matters outside
of his own special line of work. He
was at the time studying the Chinese
language by using a book written by a
missionary and was reading In English
another book by a missionary describ
ing the character of the people. He
arranged to send telephone messages
ahead of us, so that the civil engineers
at their various stations would be pre
pared to receive us and help us on
our way. We may be sure that tele
graphic communication between the
different parts of the Russian army
will be maintained where .Colonel
Ghenche is if it be within the bounds
of possibility to do so. To illustrate
his energy we would remark that on
one. morning .when we got up to a
rather late breakfast we were won
dering why he delayed so long, when
we found that he had taken a ten-mile
horseback ride in attendance upon his
duties while we slept.
For nearly a month we were enter
tained and forwarded on our way by
the civil engineers who were construct
ing the Chinese Eastern Railroad in
Manchuria. They belonged to all the
Russian nationalities. Some were Cir
cassians, some were Poles, some were
Little Russians, some were Great Rus
sians, some were Russian-Germans and
seine were Russian-Armenians, but all
were energetic, able, well educated men,
living with thoir families in temporary
isolation from the outside world, while
hundreds of thousands of Chinese cool
ies were under their direction, making
the cuts and fills of the prospective
railroad. Among the most interesting
and typical of the engineers was A. A.
Ter-Ovakimoff, constructing 100 miles
of the road south of the Sungari River.
He is an Armenian, of dark complexion,
black hair and black eyes, whose edu
cation preparatory to the technical
schools had been of the most thorough
classical order. He could quote the
Latin and the Greek authors almost
without limit, while French and Ger
man and Russian were as familiar to
him as his native tongue, yet he was
mingling with the Chinese laborers and
superintendents on most familiar terms
and was succeeding in prosecuting the
work with great energy, j A year ago
he wrote me in good French that now
that the railroad was completed he wai
remaining behind to build a steam
gristmill, and wished me to put him
in communication with some American
firm which could supply him with the
requisite machinery. Six months ago
he wrote me again in English, apologiz
ing for his poor style on the ground
that he had been studying It for only
two months, but the style was almost
faultless. We may be sure again that
the Russians are amply supplied with
able and efficient civil engineers and
railroad superintendents to repair any
temporary damages that may be In
flicted upon their lines of railroad com
munication.
It was our fortune to travel for many
hundred "miles with Colonel Dessino, the
Russian military agent in Northern
China. He was a tall, rather slender
loan of pleasant personal appearance,
able to talk readily In English,
and not afraid to be communicative.
The Russian system differs from that
of most nations in having its military
representatives in foreign countries
entirely separated from the civil repre
sentatives. Colonel Dessino's business
was to watch the entire military eitua-
Uon. and to report independently to the
Minister of War at St. Petersburg. His
headquarters were at Shanghai, but he
vas making a tour of Manchuria when
we fell in with him. Ii's family at the
t-me. however, was in Japan. Iiis ex
tensive and minute knoi*1Â«Â»dre of af
fair; in the East must bv of Inesti
mable service in the present conflict, so
that It is not strange thai he. with Mr.
Pocatelloff, are frequently liroiisht into
<onlerence with Admiral Alex'.cC .and
the representatives of Â« Baron Rosen.
Long and intimate contact with the
personnel of these , and man/ other
piominent Russian reprÂ»sentativos In
the Far East makes one sure that rhe
Japanese have undertaken :i *ar . more
serious task In trying to eis.oÂ«Is2 R.is
rta than they undertook m attacking
China, --Â¦ - Â¦ ' - -" - - - . â¢
stars and stripes or the stars and bars â that is peace,
happiness, fraternity. These blessings are due -J not
only the soldiers of 1861-65, but the whole American peo
*plÂ©.. Therefore, this movement, as I have said, is not
political (that is in the sense that the word to-day is
used.) The movement is fraternal. Men of all creeds
join" in the sentiment."
While the suggestion is an attractive one, there are
of course many obvious objections, and it will be for the
veterans themselves to decide whether or no the ex
pected good will overbalance the difficulty of carrying
it through harmoniously. At any rate, the issue is likely
to be one of considerable interest to the public as well
as to the veterans of both camps. Senator Hoar put the
issue neatly when he said with his customary caution:
"If, as I hope and believe, such a meeting would be a
source of unalloyed pleasure to both sides, and would
lead to a heartier love for the Union and a more cordial
respect for each other^ it #vould be an admirable thing
to do."

THK FEDERAL COURT
The man whose pretended loss of
memory puzzled the physicians at the
Central Emergency Hospital for a few
days till they discovered that he was
a faker Is now in the "tanks" at the
City' Prison and, will have three charges
of forgery booked against him. His real
name is John D. Meyers and. for thren
weeks up to the time he went to the
hospital on February 24 he had been
employed asa solicitor for Paul Rleger
& Co., 'perfumers, 161 First street.
He was arrested early . yesterday
morning on Mission street by Police
men Cullnan and Cameron. He met
James F. Reljly of 1827 Fifteenth street
about 1. o'clock. in the morning and, it
is alleged, asked Reilly to advance him
$2 on a check for $25 on the Hiberniu
Bank payable to R. A. Lane and pur
porting to be signed '"J. A. Tobin." He
told. Reilly a plausible story and got
the $2. ReiUy went into a saloon nnd
asked the bartender to cash the, check
and was informed that It was worth
less. Reilly immediately notified the
policemen and Meyers was arrested.
Detective Whitaker had been looking
for MeyerÂ«- since February 16. On that
day, it is alleged, he went, into the
Railroad saloon, 635 Clay street, and
drank $2 worth of liquor, paying for it
with a check for $30 'on the Nevada
National Bank and purporting to be
signed by Paul Rieger & Co., The
check was worthless. On March 2, the
day he was discharged from the Cen
tral Emergency Hospital, he went into
the Lion pharmacy at Seventh and Mis
sion streets, it is asserted, and pur
chased a bottle of medicine. It is al
leged that he gave in payment a check
for $5, also purporting to be signed by
Paul Rieger &;Co., and got a dollar
on it, telling the clerk that he would
call later and redeem the check.
by the time the officers had an inkling
of what was wrong the thieves had
made good their escape.
Martin could give no definite descrip
tion of any of the robbers other than
that the man with the light overcoat
was tall, rather good looking and
youn?. He further stated that the man
wa? a Ftranger to the Stock Board and
that he had never seen him before.
The money wÂ«.p in the right inside
pocket of Martin's coat.
Detective Byram was detailed on the
case, but as yet no arrests have been
as l*>Ft he could, but was so agitated
that he could not make his listeners
understand the details of the case, and
A few minutes later Martin put his
hand to his pocket for the money, but
found, to his dismay, that it was gone.
HÂ«* frantically called out that he had
been robbed and ordered the doors
locked. The announcement of the rob
bery created great excitement among
the brokers and. to a man. they felt to
see if they had also been despoiled.
Martin told the story of the robbery
It is the theory of the police that the
man with the light overcoat jostled
Martin from the rear, at the same time
throwing the swinging end of the coat
<>vÂ«>r the aged man's shoulder so that
it hung down in front of him. Thus
shielded, the thief quietly drew the
canvas bag out of Martin's pocket. At
i he same time another of the gang
Jostled into Martin from the other side,
thus drawing his attention from the
coat. While Martin looked to see who
had bumped Into him. the first thief
withdrew, with the coat still over his
arm. entirely hiding the sack that he
h^ld underneath.
He vvpnt straightway to the Pacific
Stock Board. 6 LHdesdorff street, and
was entering the crowded hall when
three m?n, one of whom had a light
overcoat thrown over his arm, bumped
into him with considerable force. They
apologized profusely and Martin
thought nothing further of the incident
until he discovered his loss.
Martin, who is SO years old and re-
Biflea at 1065 Tenth avenue, East Oak
land, upon his arrival at the city early
yesterday morning went to Wells,
Farpo & Co.'s Bank, the Donohoe-Kelly

Asked . abput the conduct of unions.
Cornelius said:
"No doubt lots of unions are going

going too far, but it will be gradually

"Would it not be better to tell the

Dr. Macfarlane, Dr. Berry, Dr. White,
Dr. Morgan, Dr. Boyer and Dr. Darst
then put' a number of questions to
Cornelius regarding the status of labor
unions and their power and ethics.
Dr. Macfarlane -protested that the
church was not 'Â¦ antagonistic to the
unions and, Indeed, they. courted the
worklngmen and would gladly become
more heartily in touch with them and
by that means a better understanding
would prevail toward the church.
Dr. Macfarlan^. asked, if .the labor
unions grow to be a power would they
not be worse than employers now?
Cornelius replied that he did not think
so, for he^knew that at the bottom
of a great body , of men there was
good sense and a desire for fair play.
In answer to a question as to the
rights of non-union men, Cornelius
said:
"The non-\inion man is usually ig
norant and more often a rogue. \ They
are the men the ministers apparently
claim to defend. The quick way would
be to let the men handle them. How
ever, we don't believe in hurting them,
but you can't feel the bitterness we
feel toward that class of men. If you
could feel as we do you wouldn't feel
so hard against us."
"We are a long way from getting
what is coming to us. In the struggle
upward there is going to be strife, all
of which cannot be charged up to our
side. We are only too eager to receive
a little concession."
Dr. Morgan asked whether Cornelius
had an opinion that ultimately there
would be a conflict such as resulted in
the French revolution.
Cornelius replied: .T
"I hope not. I don't. think it is pos
sible in this country."
Dr. Macfarlane' here interjected- hisÂ»
astonishment that Cornelius' mind
should have been given up to the idea
that! the church opposed the men - be
longing to unions. There wa's no ground
for such a thought. He asked whether
labor was not cutting its own throat
by holding an antipathy to the church.
The lack of moral character, he point
ed out, was a grave danger. The ab
sence of men from^the church and the
keeping of their children from relig
ious service was a neglect of moral
training.
Cornelius then continued:
"I ahi afraid that" a certain pastor
.who feels; that union a-nd . non-union
men should work side by side is mis
taken, for that is â¢ impossible. There
must be a closed shop. We insist upon
' "I am accustomed to the rough places
of life and not the fine element, If you
will, because I am up against the act
ualities of life, therefore it may be pre
sumptuous, of me to tell you of the re
lations between the church and the
working man.
"It is just this, either the vvorklngmen
are deserving better conditions or they
are getting only what they deserve.
The representative of the carmen was
introduced by Rev. Dr. Macfarlane, the
object, of Cornelius being to explain
the position of the union men especially
with regard to the churches. Cornelius
said: ' : - "
' Richard Cornelius, president of the
Carmen's Union, and ministers of 'the
Christian church, presided over by Dr.
W. M. ' White, had an Interesting, hour
or so yesterday afternoon at the Y.
M..C. A. '
Policemen P. G. Foley and W. J.
Brown asseverated that in all their
experience they had never tackled a
tougher customer than August Hansen,
a diminutive Swede, who appeared in
Mogan's court with his head swathed
in bandages. They said he fought like
a whole menagerie of wild cats,- and
that to overcome him they were com
pelled -to apply their clubs to his cran
ium often and with great force:
The defendant and his wife reside at
27 Welch street, and were fighting about
four dozen of their neighbors last Sun
day morning when the police Inter
vened. Mrs. Hansen entered her dwell
ing, locked the door and retreated to
the balcony, from which vantage point
she urged her husband, to die rather
than submit to arrest, Interspersing
her commands with epithets addressed
to the men in uniform that provoked
them to attempt her capture also. So
while Hansen kept two policemen busy,
several others obtained a ladder and
stormed the balcony, carrying it after
a sharp encounter in which the lady
scored some honors. The sight. of his
helpmeet in the clutches of the law
goaded Hansen to mightier effort, and
it was then the policemen were forced
to , swing their locusts. ,-
Battery and disturbing the, peace are
Thomas Smith, whose regular voca
tion was described as a "butter-In for
drinks," stood before Judge Mogan on
a charge of larceny, the exhibits in the
cafce being an overcoat and a sackcoat
stolen from the proprietor of a dance
hall at Kearny and Jackson streets.
In further explanation of the defend
ant's occupation it was stated that
while the dance \vas on and the joy
unconflned in the terpslchorean tempi?
in question he swelled the bar receipts
by drinking at the expense of mascu
line revelers, who Invited their fair
partners, but not Thomas, to partake
of liquid refreshments. In this way
Thomas managed to keep hia thirst as
suaged and it was thought that he stole
the garments to sell them for cash with
which to purchase- life's other necj^
saries. He will be sentenced to-day.
"This thing of pleading ignorance of
our language as an excuse for law
breaking Is becoming monotonous,"
said the court. "These children of
Greece must be taught that they should
learn something about the language
and the laws of this land before they
engage In mercantile pursuits in our
midst. Ten dollars or ten days' im
prisonment for you, George."
H. Giftowley, a native of Greece, wa3
peddling fruit at California and Mont
gomery streets when Policeman Pashen
commanded him to keep his wagon
moving, and instead of obeying the
command Giftowley laughed until he
was arrested. 'With the aid of an in
terpreter the defendant Informed Judge
Mogan that to his Ignorance of the
English language was really attribut
able his neglect to move on, as he did
not understand one word the policeman
addressed to him, but suspected from
h'.s gestures that he was telling a funny
story and thought it was his duty to
laugh. Case continued.
Then came George Batsakis, another
Greek peddler, accused of a similar
offense. He was selling peanuts on the
Steuart-street wharf when Harbor Po
liceman Theoll requested him to remove
his cart, and his response was a boist
erous laugh. Unfamiliarity with Eng
lish as it Is uttered was the defense in
this case also.
Alfon?o Flores, aged 17, Is playing
hide and seek with a warrant-armed
policeman, who arrested Labrada Mor
ales, aged thirty something, for vag
rancy, on complaint of the youth's
Aother, who thus hoped to sever a
tender attachment existing between
Alfonso and Labrada. ,
When the case was called yesterday
in Mogan's court the announcement
was made that Alfonso could not be
found and a -continuance was ordered
to give the police time to search for
him. I^abrada was there, however, also,
Mrs. Flores and several witnesses for
the prosecution. One of these, a young
man, testified that the Alfonso-Labrada
liaison was the scandal of the Mexican
quarter and that Labrada had boasted
of her conquest and declared she loved
Alfonso too dearly to give him up to
his mother or any one else. .
The other witnesses were Instructed
to reassemble on March 11.
Mabel Wallace and Kittle Donovan
acknowledged they were in the apart
ment of a woman nemed Irene while
she "doped" a young soldier and
robbed him of all his cash, but declared
that they happened to be gazing
through the window at the time and
did not see either the drugging or
the robbery. Judge Mogan displayed
his confidence in their statement by
intimating that on next Friday he will
hold both of the women for larceny.
The robbery took place in a lodg
ing-house at 45 Stockton street, and
Charles Cleal, who was clerk of the
establishment at the time, is also a
defendant. The woman Irene, who is
alleged to have actually committed the
theft, has disappeared, and none of her
former associates can give more ac
curate description of her than that she
had yellow hair and wore a red gown.
â¢ . â¢ â¢
In another door-kicking case there
were two defendants, W. Williams and
S. Wengt, and they were charged with
having wantonly applied their foot
wear with violence to Various . doors
on Third street Sunday evening. They
were intoxicated at the time, the ar
resting policeman declared, and when
they appeared before Judge Fritz yes
terday "morning they had not entirely
recovered from inebriety. When the
Judge accused them of being drunk,
however, they entered vigorous denial,
but when they attempted to ascend the
steps leading to the bench they stum
bled in such a way as to shatter their
protest. They were remanded until
they are sober enough to receive sen
tence.
to the house, he was ignored by the
inmates, and as the night was cold and
his head unprotected, Â«he kicked the
door and damaged it $10 worth. He
agreed to pay that amount to Mr.
Denny, and Judge Fritz dismissed the
complaint. â¢
Malicious mischief was the charge en
tered by Roy Denny against Peter Mc-
Donald, the specific accusation being
that Peter smashed the front door of
complainant's residence at Post
street, last Saturday night. The tes
timony went to show that Mr. McDon
ald had escorted a young woman to
the Denny domici.le and that after see-
Ing her safely inside, he departed with
out his hat. When he sought entrance
Miss Anna Nelson informed Judge
Cabaniss that she did not sit upon the
prostrate carcass of Richard Moore, as
had erroneously been reported in the
press.
.When she found the man attempting
to plunder her apartment in the Pres
cott House, "she Just grabbed him and
screamed, Miss Nelson explained, and
her statement was corroborated by
Clerk W. H. Bowden, who was at
tracted by her outcry and aided her in
holding her prisoner until the police
arrived.
The case was continued.
â¢ â¢ â¢
"This is a large world of ours," re
marked the Judge, "and I am. unable
to understand why you two people can
not move around in it without getting
in each other's way. If you, Mr. But
ler, promise me that you will endeavor
to circulate without pestering Miss
Ruggles I will dismiss the case."
Mr. Butler promised.
â¢ â¢ â¢
Miss Rugrgles then magnanimously
announced that she did not desire to
have Mr. Butler incarcerated, but
merely compelled to cease pestering
her.
"I doan* like to ccmterdick a lady,"
replied Mr. Butler, "but in self-defense
I mus' do so. The fack an' truth Is
she's bin a pesterin' me. I've bin tryln'
ter keep out of her way, but somehow
we've allus bin collidin'. That's the
fack an' the truth." ' "
"He has kept on pesterin' me," she
said, "and I want the law's purtec
tion."
"Why have you pestered the lady?"
the court asked the defendant.
Miss Ruggles, a colored maiden re-
Elding at 1206 Broadway, had William
Butler, also colored, arrested for per
secuting her with his attentions, and
Judge Cabaniss heard the lady's com
plaint.
. Subsequently a pool selling case pro
voked further language from the bench.
His Honor condemned the practice of
arresting persons for selling pools with
out first having obtained material evi
dence sufficient to assure conviction.
"It is apparent," said the Judge, "that
these cigar store poolrooms are con
ducted on a business basis and that
written record is kept of the bets made.
Why are not these records seized and
submitted as evidence? Any time an
arrest is contemplated I will issue a
search warrant to enable the police to
obtain any books or other records that
may help the prosecution. Then the
Grand Jury may find more convictions
of persons arrested for pool selling."
All of which was likewise indorsed by
Prosecuting" Attorney Harris.
Prosecuting Attorney Harris ap
proved the foregoing remarks and con
tributed a few of his own along the
same line.
When two women were charged be
fore Police Judge Fritz yesterday with
having offended decency by flaunting
their shameful calling on Bacon place
the police were given another reminder
of what' the court considered their duty
in such cases.
"It is my opinion," said his Honor,
"that neither Bacon place nor the Hotel
Xymphia can be suppressed by occa
sionally arresting two or three of the
women residents. If the police are real
ly sincere in this crusade they can
make it effective by arresting and re
arresting the people to whom the wo
men pay exorbitant rentals â the per
sons who profit by allowing their prop
erty to be used for Immoral purposes.
There Is a law for the punishment of
such persons, and this court will heart
ily support any earnest effort the po
lice may make to enforce that law.
But thfs thing of arresting a wcrman
now and then accomplishes nothing.
The case against these two defendants
is continued for a week, as the court
desires to see whether the crusade is
to be pursued systematically and with
energy, or Is merely another spasmqdic
effort."
ACCUSED OF FORGERY
that way inclined to-day. I believe
that the labor union comes nearer
teaching what Christ meant than the
churches. While we have men In our
organization that would stand for any
thing that is bad. they are not pre
dominating. I want to go to church,
but not to be told that I must be sat
isfied with a place that God has not
given me."*
. Dr. Boyer asked why the unions were
not in sympathy with the church in
its work to suppress the saloon.
Cornelius said: :"â¢ -
"I have an opinion that dignitaries
in the church spend more in a month
than the worklngman does in a year."
Cornelius then continued by saying:
"We oppose the liquor traffic. There
are saloons in the Mission that are
nothing else but gambling dens where
they play cards all the night through.
They are innocent enough to look at
from the outside, but within they are
dens where gambling is rife. I have
taken steps in the . matter and after
considerable' trouble got the Commis
sioners to close them, but they are in
full blast again, and it is my Intention
to go after them once more."
Members of the Methodi3t Ministers'
Association met yesterday morning at
Epworth Hall and heard a paper by
the Rev. Mr. Oinafti, in which he ad
vocated a certain or limited form of
ritualism In the Methodist church.
The Presbyterian Ministers 1 Associa
tion met at the Presbyterian House,
Sacramento street, the Rev. Moses Ber
cowitz, president, in the chair. Dr.
H. L.. Seager read a paper, his sub
ject being "Value of Pain," which
proved so interesting to the clergymen
that It was decided a good idea to hear
more papers from laymen.
The Baptist ministers assembled at
their weekly meeting at the Y. M. C. A.
yesterday morning, the Rev. Louis J,
Sawyer in the chair. A paper on "The
Condition and Prospects of Baptist
Work Among Chinese in America," to
gether with statistics, by the Rev.
George Campbell, gave great satisfac
tion.
The Congregational Ministers* Asso

The Woman's Occidental Board of

Morton claims to be a teamster.
Tracing back, the detectives find that
in 1902 he was convicted at Salinas of
KTand larceny and" sentenced to ten
years' imprisonment. But a new trial
was granted and Morton was freed,
the evidence of a confederate not being
corroborated. He will be arraigned to
morrow in the Police Court.
Further, the police say they are sat
isfied that Morton was the burglar
who entered N. J. Collins' residence at
5*7 Twenty- fifth street about the same
time that the Thompson home was
plundered and stale Collins" Jewelry.
From Alameda have come inquiries
concerning Morton, the police across
the estuary believing they can fix at
least one burglary in the Enclnal City
on the prisoner.
Edward Morton, who was arrested in
San Francisco several daj;s ago, has
been charged with burglary by the
Oakland police, who say their prisoner
is responsible for a number of recent
daylight burglaries on this side of the
bay.
The crime that has been directly
traced to Morton is the burglary of
Mrs. Kate Thompson's residence at 2126
Grove street on February 28, when 5500
to $600 worth of jewelry "was stolen.
The detectives searched the pawnshops
across the bay. At last Morton was
run down and captured with some of
Mrs. Thompson's missing gems in his
possession.

Redfern made written apology for his
refusal to obey the order of the Judges
last Friday when he was instructed to
take the mount on Laureatea. He ex
cused his action on the plea that he
had obeyed the orders of his father
in preference to the Judges, but made
acknowledgment of his error, and
begged for reinstatement. Judge Ham
ilton thereupon made the following rul
ing: "Jockey Redfern has made an
honest statement "of the facts in his
case and it is the opinion of the Judges
that his manly apok\y is sufficient to
purge him of the ill-advised act of con
tempt for the authority of the Los
Angeles Jockey Club. The ruling
against him Is rescinded."
The disbarment against the Jockey's
father still Is in force.

nre, with Martin ; up, was again a
starter, but either the weight or the
mud prevented the mare from show
ing to any advantage. Rustic Girl
showed little speed.
Barney Schreiber's big brown colt,
Inspector Halpln, said farewell to the
maiden class in the kindergarten
event. In previous* races the Inspec
tor always displayed an inclination
to loiter on the way.' In this last es
say, though, Bullman got him away
well and, leading throughout, downed
Kscobosa, the second choice, a length.
Hooligan finished third. The winner,
coupled with Mildred B, ruled favor
ite in the betting at odds of 2% to 1.
Travers, on Billy Moore, an 8 to 5
choice played down from 3, threw away
the seven-furlong selling affair. He did
not do it intentionally, but "has yet to
learn how to cut the stretch turn with
out running his mount out to Shell
Mound station. Blackthorn, a horse
backed one day last" week in heavy
going, ridden by Sheehan, was returned
the winner at 8 X ,Â£ to 1. Blackthorn pre
fers sloppy going, such as it was yes
terday, but at that played in extremely
good luck. The favorite had him
beaten until Travers made his brilliant
turn into the stretch* On Billy Moore.
This gave Sheehan a new lease of life,
and he kept the tiring black horse
going long enough to lead the favorite
out a neck. Ripper took the place from
Assessment. Sunello had a leg that
prevented him from doing anything.
Only because Bonner, on David S,
outflnished Holbrook did Pat Morrissey
lose the mile and seventy-yard run,
also decided under selling conditions.
The footing looked made to order for
old Pat, and the books did an extensive
business in pasteboards at odds of 8 to
5. Sue Johnson and The Fretter cut
out the running almost to the stretch,
where both quit and Bonner, astride
David S, took command. Holbrook
then cut loose with the favorite, too,
but Bonner outgeneraled him, putting
David S over the plate first by half a
length. Frank Woods, under moderate
handling, ran a good third.
Well, the ride of Jerry Roach on
Lansdowne, favorite for the six-furlong
selling selection, was certainly the
limit. He said he was told not to make
too much early use of the gelding, and
he didn't. Instead, Jerry let his mount
fall out of the running the length of an
electric light mast. Handpress and
Alice Carey had the race between them,
Johnny Daly reaching home first on
the former, half a length in advance
of Dr. Rowell's mare. Flaneur disposed
of Lansdowne for the show. ,
NOTES OF THE TRACK.
Purses went to but two favorites.
Hlrtle and Blackthorn were the long
est priced winners of the afternoon.
The usual Monday crowd witnessed
the sport.
Five events were run off iti the
sloppy going at Oakland yesterday
without any abnormal plunges being
Indulged In by the crowd, but the
last was quite a spirited betting af
fair. M. J. Daly sent Sailor Knot to
the post | for seven othe"r owners to
unravel, and from 2 the odds dropped
under the force of a. terrific fusillade
to 9 to 10. Mike Daly thought his colt
would win the length of the grand
stand, and after a furious drive
Johnny Daly Just managed to drop
him in a head before Solanus. with
Jack Martin up. Both riders indulged
in some jockeying-through the stretch,
with Daly finally carrying off the hon
ors. Toledo was a starter in the race,
but that's about all.

STOCKTON, March 7. â The Feder
ated Trades to-night ordered a general
strike in the Holt Agricultural Works,
and the union men will go out in the
morning. They will try to take with
them all the non-union men who are
employed in that institution, and a
long fight is promised, for the Holts say
they will run an open shop or shut
down. They have a lot of men em
ployed who they believe will stay with
them.
The trouble arose with the Black
smiths' Union several months ago. The
Holts wanted their men to sign agree
ments not to strike for a year, and
those who would not do It were dis
charged. Non-union blacksmiths were
employed, but union men remained in
the other departments. Conferences
were held and the locked-out men and
the Holts agreed on some points, but
the men wanted the union blacksmiths
given preference when new men were
to be employed.
This the Holts would not agree to,
because they had promised their help
that they would not give preference
Against them. The unions yielded on
the point of making It an open shop
for a time, but would not sign tho
agreements wanted by the Holts.
Many conferences have been held
and the local Merchants' and Manufac
turers' Association tried to settle the
affair, but could not.

sition yesterday- to the account of
George Mowry as executor of Strauss'
will. He claims that Mowry has mis
managed the estate and so used the
property entrusted to his care that he
has benefited himself at the expense
of the heirs. The principal asset of
{he Strauss estate Is the Baders gold
mine. In this property, the contest
ant alleges, Strauss had a large inter
est, and he avers that Mowry, in his
account, has not credited the estate
with any share of the gold taken from
the mine since 1895. Mowry, it i3
said, claims to be the sole owner of
the mine in question, claiming that
the title. became vested in him after
Strauss had allowed his interest to
lapse.

Taking a number of insane soldiers
from the Pacific Coast tc- the Atlantic
is not a detail readily sought by the
officer who is ordered tcr go In charge
of them. Surgeon Benjamin J. Edger
Jr. started East about ten days ago
with thirteen patients, in charge of
nine guards. Two of these patients
were very violent and had to be han
dled with the greatest care. The c-ther
eleven were suffering from mild at
tacks, but these really needed more
care than the two who were kept close
ly confined. A special car was char
tered here and all went, well until Ne
braska was reached. There the party
ran into a terrible snowstorm, which
tied them up for a day. The cold was
Intense and all suffered, despite every-!
thing that the railroad officials could
do for them. Finally the car was
switched on to another line, and Just
before they approached Denver they
ran* into a burning bridge. The car
was then run back and svvitcTied on to
a sidetrack, and by last reports it was
nearly two days late in getting on its
way to Chicago. St. Elizabeth, D. C,
is its destination, where the afflicted
men will go into the National Hospital
for insane soldiers.
The previous lot of insane patients
was sent last December, in charge of
Major W. P. Kendall. On this trip,
although every precaution was taken
for the welfare of those in his charge,
one of his patients succeeded In elud
ing the vigilance of his guards and
in the dead of night Jumped from his
berth, dashed through the car and
leaped through a closed window while
the train was going fifty miles an hour.
The unfortunate was Instantly killed.
The transport Buford Is scheduled to

"I agree with the court below," said
Judge Ross, "that the gross neglect of

stance of man's inhumanity to man:
but, being of the opinion that by the
law of England the ship is liable in
rem for the damages claimed and that,
under the decision of the Supreme
Court in the case of the Osceola, U. S.
158. 175, a seaman is not allowed to
recover indemnity for the negligence
of the master, or any member of the
crew, I feel obliged to dissent from

validity is still before the courts and
in all probability the ordinance adopted
yesterday will also be the subject of
a legal battle. Rates- are now being
collected by mutual agreement on the'
schedule adopted in 1902.
Ayes â Alpers, Bent, Boxton, Finn,
Hocks. Lunstedt, McCleilan, Rea, San
derson.
"I believe that when a man discov
ers that he has done wrong he should
be given an opportunity to set him
self right, and for this reason I desire
to change my vote. I do not believe
the ras company can make money at
a rate of 90 cents, as among other
things it fs taxed' on a franchise it
does not possess, any one having tne
privilege to tear up the streets and
lay gas mains. As a result of this I
find that its meters do not register cor-i
rectly and the gas is not up to the
standard."
The vote on final passage was as fol
lows:
Ayesâ Alpers, Bent, Boxton,. Finn,
Lunstedt, Rea, Sanderson. Noes-
Booth, Brandenstein, Comte, Braun
hart, Connor, D'Ancpna, Eggers,
Hocks, McClellan, Payot, Rock.
A supplemental report, giving some
additional details regarding the cost
of manufacture, ana distribution c-f gas,
was then read and a vote taken on
the adoption of the ordinance. It was
lost by a vote of 9 to 9, Supervisor
Rock, who at the last meeting favored
the measure, having decided in the
meantime to change his vote. In ex
planation he said: "When I voted in
favor of the ordinance last week I
thought I was doing right, but since
that time I have changed my mind.. I
have interviewed many people and as
certained facts which were unknown
to me at that time and I believe a fur
ther consideration of this matter ad
visable.
ROCK MAKES A CHARGE.
In accordance with his request, Su
pervisor Boxton moved that the ordi
nance be referred back either to the
committee on artificial lights or a com
mittee of the whole, or both. His mo
tion was opposed by Brandenstein, who
said the ordinance had been framed
after careful deliberation and a full
examination of the figures and facts
presented on both sides. ! He consid
ered it Just to everybody. The motion
was lost by the following vote:
VOTE IS A TIE.
After an investigation extending over
several weeks, in the course of which
the affairs of the gas company were
thoroughly probed and an .ordinance
fixing the maximum gas rate at 90
cents passed to print, the Supervisors
yesterday, by a tie vote, failed to pass
the ordinance. The result was a sur
prise to many, as a majority of the
members of the board at last week's
meeting seemed satisfied with the 90
cent rate.
When the matter of fixing a min
imum quality and a maximum price
for gas was brought up, Attorney Sam
uel Knight was given the privilege of
the floor and made a brief address.
He said the final passage of the pro
posed ordinance would be a great in
justice to the company and asked the
members of the board in all fairness
to make a more thorough Investigation
of the figures presented. He said it
would be only just to resubmit the
matter to the committee, in order that
it might be given an opportunity to
submit a rate which would be fair to
the committee, fair to the Supervisors,
fair to the company and fair to the
consumers.

PARIS, March 7.â According to the
officials of the Panama Canal Com
pany, no obstacle has arisen to the
transfer of the concession to the Unit
ed States. The company understands
that Cromwell, the American counsel
for the company, will be accompanied
abroad by Special Assistant Attorney
General Russell of the Department of
Justice, who will see that everything
is transferred with due regularity.
It was learned at the United States
embassy that former Premier Wal
deck-Tlousseau has rendered an opinion
showing that there are no legal obsta
cles to the transfer nor flaws in the
title.

A % vessel thought to have been the
Antelope was sighted in the vicinity
of the Cocuille River February 9 by
the lookout on the steamer Elizabeth.
There was no certain identification,
however, and even that was nearly a
month ajro.
The Antelope is "a -'Schooner of the
scow family and has weathered man;'
heavy blows. Her skipper, Captain
Cuthrell, is a good seaman and he. had
with him enough capable men to handle
the craft. It is now fifty-one days
since the Antelope left this port, and
although hopeful for the best, her
owners, George W. Hume & Co.," are
very anxious about the vessel's safety.
In many cases this unexpected protrac
tion of a coasting schooner's voyage
would mean short rations of food or
water, or both. Hume's vessels, how
ever, are noted for their well-stocked
larders and if the Antelope is afloat,
say the owners, three meals a day are
being served to all hands, and if the
schooner keeps up the Flying Dutch
man role for another month there will
still be occupation for the cook.
The little schooner Antelope, which
left here January 17 for the Coquille
River, is making a record voyage for
length, if something worse has not be
fallen her. Howling gales have swept
the coast waters since she passed out
of the harbor and more than one stout
vessel has been roughly handled by
the elements.

About 150 creditors gathered in
front of the bank to-day, but they re
ceived no comforting assurances.
BERLIN, March 7. â The failure of
Brendel & Co., a banking house, was
announced to-day. The flrm was es
tablished in 1778. The difficulties of
the concern are attributed to the em
bezzlement and speculation of a cash
ier, who has absconded.
The liabilities of Brendel & Co. are
estimated at $500,000 at the utmost
and probably will be less. Johannes
Reinhard Is the name of the cashier
who caused the bank's ruin, the old
est financial bureau in Berlin. Rein
hard disappeared on Saturday, leaving
a note for his wife saying:
"Good-by, dear; I am sorry, but I
could not do otherwise."
Reinhard had secretly led a disso
lute life. It was reported on the
Boerse to-day that he recently sold
securities valued at $150,000 belong
ing to the firm.

DEFAULTING CASHIER
CAUSES BANK'S RUIN
Tiiat said Rooney rejected said offer; that
Â«iid offer of raid plaintiffs was made with the
fraudulent and corrupt Intent of cheating and
defrauding the said defendant*, as officers of
the State of California, and the Deople of the
State of California, of the increased rental
sum -which would accrue if said nlalntlffs
were disturbed as holders of said privilege;
that by 'heir offer, as aforesaid, plaintiffs
showed they were not fit and proper persons to
â¢ onriuct said or any privilege in the gift of
defendants a-id the State of California.
Defendants deny the allegation that there is
no reason and that they do not claim that
there is any r'accn why plaintiffs are not the
proper persons tf> exercise said privilege; but,
on the contrary, defendants as a. further de
fense to said action allese that plaintiffs are
not the proper persons to txerclse said uprlvl
lege. They are informed and believe and upon
*uÂ«-n Information and belief allege: That
prior to tl-e 3<Hh day of December. 1903, said
plaintiff, Orer.r. !n the presence of said
plaintiff. Foster, offered to said Rooney a one
third (1-3* Interest in the firm cf Fester &
Orear. thÂ» ab^ve named plaintiffs, and guar
anteed said Hooney that said one-third In
terest would net said Rooney at least $300 per
month; that said offer of said one-third In
terest was made with the proviso that said
Rooney ivo--:ld withdraw all efforts to secure
said privilege, and that said Rooney would
influence said defendant. Spear, to r>ermlt the
rental sum for said privilcK?, to wit, the sum
of $430, to remain the same as it then was.
The answer of the Board of Harbor
Commissioners to the suit of Charles
Foster and Horace Orear for an in
junction restraining the board from
granting to John F. Rooney the priv
ilege of conducting a news stand in the
ferry building on the ground that it
had been obtained by Rooney because
he vfas a brother-in-law of Charles
Spear, a member of the board, was
filed yesterday. Although the matter
was practically decided by Judge Sea
well in favor of Fester & Orear when
he overruled the board's demurrer to
their complaint and an injunction is
sued, the board takes advantage of the
privilege granted it by law and enters
at this date a denial of the charges
made by the plaintiffs.
The answer is a complete denial of
the charge made by the plaintiff that
the board acted arbitrarily and ca
priciously in awarding the privilege to
Rooney. It also denies that Foster &
Orear were not given ample time to
prepare their bid. and asserts that
Spear, in dealing with them, never at
any time acted as other than a mem
ber of the board and its president. The
board also alleges that Foster &
Orear have been guilty of an endeavor
to force the board to favor their peti
tion, and in support of this allegation
the board says:
ST. JOSEPH, Mo., March 7.â Mark
Dunn, convicted of the murder 'of a
wealthy farmer named Fenton, and
sentenced to be hanged, escaped from
'jail to-day. Dunn got possession of
two revolvers that were smuggled into
jail and forced the death watch to
submit to being bound with wire he
had used in making baskets. Ke held
the watchman prisoner all night and
forced him to call the jailer soon after
daybreak. When the jailer appeared
Dunn threatened to kill the death
watch unless the jailer turned him out
through the wheel. The Jailer, to save
the watchman, did as ordered. Then
the murderer forced the jailer and his
brother, a deputy sheriff, to enter the
jail, locked them in and escaped with
the key.

STOCK MARKET.
EASTERN MARKETS:
Considering the weakness of cables the
opening in wheat was fairly steady. May was
%c lower to %c higher, at 96%c to 96%e
while July was %@Uc lower to a shade
higher.' at 91% to 92%c. The.efTect of the
downward tendency of foreign markets was
offset, for the time being, by the failure of
predictions of general rains In the Southwest
Reports from that section were more decided
than before in regard to the critical condition
of the growing plant. American crop predic
tions were soon set aside, however, upon the
appearance of the statistics for the day
World's shipments were liberal, with exports
from Russia as â¢ large as usual. The amount
on paseagÂ« showed a fair increase, and local
and Northwest receipts were large. Primary
receipts also showed an Increase over those of
a year ago. The market easod off under these
influences. May declining to.95%c and July
to 91 He. A diversion In favor of the bulls re
sulted from the announcement regarding
farmers' ' reserves at. the beginning of this
month., .According .to., the authority quoted
the : amount of wheat in farmers' hands at
that time was 22.3 per cent of the entire crop
thÂ»: smallest reserves In ten years.' Th<j pit
crowd bought quite freely on this information.
Prices made a slight response to the improved
demand. Confirmation of the rumor ' of the
ending Of the strike in Argentina started a
selling movement late In the day, and prices
started down at a rapid rate." Stop loss orders
came nut on the decline, resulting, in a sharp
break.- May sold 'off to 93 %c. a loss of 3Uc
from the high point of the : day, while July
dropped . 2%o ; to 89>,4c. Shorts covered freely
in the May option, causing a rally of about a
cent, but July held near the low: point." May
closed firm: at - 94c. Â¦ but : July was weak at
89%Â«TÂ«)%C." Â¦Â¦'Â¦ -Â¦Â¦Â¦Â¦ 'â¢/.. :.-. ' .
In view- of the extreme ; weakness , in wheat.'
thÂ« mm market held remarkably r steady." May
CHICAGO, March 7.â Liberal Russian ex
ports and a settlement of the Argentine
strike caused a net loss of 2%c to-day ' in
May wheat. July is down 2fte. Corn is Uc

owing to the lightness of new business devel-
in spite of progress toward clearing up
freight congestion due to weather obstacles.
ThÂ« policy of continued heavy borrowines by
railroads indicated by the loan expansion in
the Saturday bank statement thus comes In
for additional criticism. An outlay of capital
avowedly depipned to accommodate the heavy
rate of *ucmiin<2 upon facilities established by
last year's bu*ineÂ«s has Its wisdom called Into
question by reason of the undeniable shrinkage
in that rate of business. It is taken 1 for
;rantf>J that the note issues on which these
railroad borrowings are effected are to be
fundrd ultimately ard the future capacity for
a%sorptlon of the securities market even after
FomÂ° revival of demand may .Â«et In is that far
dimmunted. It !s arrued also that the com
paratively hfsh interest rate exacted by bank
ers' on th"se railroad notes is due to the
:>rcs:>ect that they may be asked to accept
bonds for th<>ir extension in funded form with
thÂ« market value of the bonds questionable

the Central Theater last night. From
the diminutive urchins that occupied
the last row in the gallery : to the
smooth-pated gentlemen that elbowed
the musicians, every one In the audi

The fun was fast and furious all the
way. Occasionally there was a bit of
pathos, but the house construed it as
something humorous any! way.
Herschel Mayall made the funniest
kind of a "Rip." Eugenia Thais Law
ton played the part":, of the sharp

Shumer as Herrick Van Hans was an
other provoker of laughter.* The others

To-morrow night San . Francisco
and Silver Leaf assemblies of - the
United Artisans will give a joint en
tertainment and dance in Red Men's
Hall. The affair has been placed in
the hands of a competent committee
and it promises to be one of the most
interesting ever given by this organ
ization. A feature of the evening will
be a lecture on "The Horrors of Pris
on Life" by Dr. J. B. Olmstead. This
will be open to any one that desires
to attend.
Horrors of Prison Life.
Mr. Carroll, as a much-exaggerated
Irishman, sang, danced and acted with
earnestness, and had no reason to com
plain of his reception and subsequent
treatment by the audience. Mr. Ken
nedy invested the character of a cyn
ical roue with appropriate gentility, and
won a favoritrsm that promises to en
dure. Ben T. Dillon again proved pos
session of rare versatility by making a
German band leader a very funny
character. Nellie Lynch also scored
well as a deceived Quakeress wife, and
Helen Russell appeared in black tights
as a premiere dansuese, but consider
ately abstained from dancing. She sang
"Mignon" polonaise with great charm,
however, and for encores won thun
derous applause by singing "The Last
Rose of Summer" and . "Home, Sweet
Home." Mr. Peachey displayed surpris
ing dash as the Lotharian husband of
the Quakeress.
There was no "explanationing" on
Fischer's stage last night. For the first
time in two years or more Kolb and
Dill were absent, and the leading mas
culine comedy was about equally di
vided between Richard F. Carroll and
John P. Kennedy, new-comers. The
niedium of their introduction to San
Francisco was a three-act affair en
titled "The Rounders," with lyrics by
Harry B. Smith and- music by Ludwig
Englander. The piece is of French ex
traction, and naturally more risque
than any of its American-born prede
cessors at Fisher's. The theme is mar
ital disloyalty, of course, and is ade
quately carried out in situations and
dialogue.

Dora Stockmeyer, a cook in the em
ploy of Mrs. Clara Jackson, 316
Fifth avenue was found suffocated in
bed at 4 o'clock yesterday morning. The
valve of the gas burner was open.
The decedent had intended to start for
Germany within a few days. Several
months ago she attempted to kill her
self with gas, but was takert to the
French Hospital and resuscitated.
She was 50 years old and a widow.
. Dr. William O. Gray, a â¢ dentist,
placed one end of a rubber tube In his
mouth after having fastened the other
end to an open gas burner some time
last Sunday night. He was discovered
at 8:30 o'clock yesterday morning
dead in his room at 9 Mason street.
He had been drinking very heavily for
a week. His" wife left for Los Angeles
several weeks ago and their friends
deny that there was any estrangement
between them.
Among the dead man's effects was
found a leiter from his wife, dated
February 24, of which the following is
a copy:
"I have dreamed of you every night
since I came, and they were such hor
rible dreams that I feel depressed all
the time. Your loving wife,
" VV "ANNA."

Gray was a native of Massachusetts,
35 years of age.
Wants Windmlller's Estate.
â¢ Lola I. Singleton Windmiller filed a
petition yesterday for the distribution
to her of the $12,000 estate of Henry
J. Windmiller, a miner, who died in
this city a year ago. She does not
state upon what grounds she makes
her request and her attorney says he
does not as yet know what his client's
claims will be.
A petition in insolvency was filed
yesterd .â¢ in the United States Dis

Chief Witt man has issued instruc

women known and suspected of being

Acting under these instructions Po

yesterday she was charged with va

and Murphy saw her mingling with a

Dr. Bowers was a much younger
man that Dowie, but he. had much
the same cast of countenance and he
was equally proud of his long beard.
Personally he was courtesy itself and
after his conviction of . murdering his
third wife he practicably, admitted do
ing, away with two others, while pro
testing that the conviction in the last
case was unwarranted. When the
jury rendered ,-its decision that he
should hang and he was taken from
Judge Murphy's courtroom he slap
ped an acquaintance on the back and
laughingly remarked:
"Well, old man; it's murder in the
first degree."
In his cell he .discussed death by
hanging, and / said -from a medical
standpoint that; such, was one of the
most pleasant methods of ending an
existence if -one would -.disregard the
shame of such a. death.
Last April. Dr. Bowers left San Fran
cisco and relinquished his office at 560
Sutter street. He .practiced in Oakland
for somemonths without success and
then removed to San -Jose, where he
man who gave his name as Dr. Fell,
who said he was from San Jose.
Dimmick was arrested for the mur
der of Benhayon and acquitted on the
trial. His description of the man who
Induced him to secure the poison tallied
exactly with that of Dr. Bowers, bu*
as the latter was already under sen
tence of death he was not dragged into
the case. Lack of further prosecution
of the case is one of the [ mysteries of
the police department in those days.
; Dr. Bowers was a physician of large
practice at the time he was arrested
and first, convicted of the murder of
his third wife. He claimed degrees
from German universities and ex
hibited them. In appearance he was not
unlike the famous apostle of Zion
ism, Dr. Dowie, now doing some good
footwork in Australia.
ATTRACTIVE TO WOMEN.
"Let the dead past bury its dead," he
said. "I am living in the present now,
but all the same Dr. Bowers should
have broken his neck from a trap in
stead of dying peaceably from par
alysis."
When Dr. Bowers was on his first
trial Detective Hogan dug , up an im
portant witness in the person of Ben
hayon, a brother of the deceased third
wife, who had frequently visited his
sister during her Illness and who testi
fied* to the appearance and smell of
the medicine administered to her.
Often, even, he procured the prescrip
tions and the druggist from whom he
secured them testified that they were
mainly composed of phosphorus, whicli
is a slow but certain poison. The mo
tive for the murder was to secure, an
insurance of $1700 in Dr. Bowers' fa,vor
on the life of his wife. "
Before the retrial Benhayon was
found dead, in bed .one : morning, and
the autopsy disclosed that he had died
from cyanogen poisoning. Immediately
an investigation was made, and it was
ascertained that a hackman named
Dimmick had purchased the' deadly
drug from a pharmacy. ': He claimed'
that he bought it at the request of a
HOGAN'S LIPS ARE SEALED.
Dr. J. Milton Bowers, one of the
most notorious of California criminals,
died yesterday at San Jose t from
paralysis. For more than a ye'ar he
had been suffering from paralytic at
tacks and had repeatedly been , re
ported in grave danger.
On April 23, 1886, Bowers was con
victed of the murder of his third wife
and sentenced to be hanged. ' He es
caped .by a decree of the Supreme
Court, which decided there was not
sufficient testimony to warrant the
verdict of death by the jury. A rehear
ing was allowed, first on a technical
ity and a second reversal was
the - result -of Â¦ missing testimony.
It was sufficiently proven that three
women whom Bowers espoused and
one man who might have been able
to give testimony against him had
been foully murdered by poison.
Detective Robert Hogan worked on
the case and gathered sufficient evi
dence against Bowers to secure a death
sentence against the defendant for the
murder of his last wife. The evidence
was conclusive that as a physician he
had administered phosphorus in cum
ulative quantities, sufficient to cause
death. On the second trial many of the
witnesses were missing and the brother
of Mrs. Bowers had been found dead
in a lodging house at 42 Geary street.
He was deemed an important witness
by the then District Attorney Southard.
Because Hogan persisted in the
prosecution of the case, he was re
moved from active duty as a detective
and relegated to a berth in the District
Attorney's office, which he still holds.
When asked about the Bowers case
last night, he^ refused to discuss the
facts.
The issue at stake at the present time
does not concern the relatives of Mrs.
Gopcevic's father, claim her legal rep
resentatives, and they say that there
fore they have not the slightest claim
to her fortune. They also say that
the late Captain Floyd never had a
brother. 'â¢..;Â¦
According to the terms of the will
of the late Mrs. Floyd, mother of Mrs.
Gopcevic, the estate was to go to her
daughter when the latter attained the
age of 21. She was to receive two
thirds of the income while she lived
and the other one-third was to be de
voted to the improvement and main
tenance of the estate. In case of the
death of the heiress the estate should
go to her children, and in the event
that she were to die childless the estate
should go to whomsoever the daughter
willed it. 'yx : *
Phillips states that he will ask that
the will be broken on the ground that
Mrs. Gopcevic was deceived by a for
eigner, who represented himself as a
nobleman, and that she soon tired of
her husband, but that he managed to
induce her to make her will in .his fa
vor.
DECEPTION IS CHARGED.
Phillips says he received a letter from
an attorney of Bridgeport, Conn., on
February 27, informing him that David
B. Floyd of that place was a brother
of the late Captain Floyd and that he
was anxious to secure a portion of the
estate. Phillips immealately commu
nicated with 'Floyd, asking him for his
power of attorney, which he expects
will arrive in a few days.
Mrs. Rosalie B. Matthews of Brook
lyn in a letter written to Phillips in
sinuates that Mrs. Gopcevic was un
duly influenced by Miss Pritchard, and
that the latter Conspired with Gopcevic
and arranged' the marriage between the
pair. Mrs. Matthews' letter was full
of sensational accusations and bitterly
upbraided Gopcevic and Miss Pritchard.
Mrs. Gopcevic executed a holographic
will nineteen days before her death in
favor of her husband, who claims to be
the scion of a royal Servian family. It is
claimed by those who are about to con
test the will that everything was not
as it should be arid they will therefore
ask the court to fully investigate the
matter.
Heirs of the late Mrs. Harry Floyd-
Gopcevic, whose name was Miss Harry
Floyd until she married a gripman of
Servian birth, are beginning to ap
pear, and yesterday morning in Su
perior Judge Kerrigan's court Attorney
L. Ernest Phillips gave notice that he
would contest the will of the late heir
ess on behalf of David B. Floyd of
Bridgeport, Conn., and Mrs. Rosalie B.
Matthews of Brooklyn.
Pltilllps has been in correspondence
with both of them and claims to have
evidence to support his claims. Floyd,
so Phillips says, was a brother of the
late Captain Floyd, father of the dead
heiress. Mrs. Matthews says she was
a cousin of. Mrs. Gopcevic and will en
deavor to secure a portion of the big
estate left by the latter.
The case was called for probate in
Judge Kerrigan's court yesterday
morning and the testimony of several
witnesses, including Miss Eliza Pritch
ard, was taken. Phillips asktd for a
continuance of the case until such time
as he would be able to secure the power
of attorney from his clients in the East.
Judge Kerrigan refused to grant the
continuance on the ground that Phil
lips had no power to act for the heirs
and. admitted the will for probate.
ALLEGED UNCLE APPEARS.
TWO PERSONS END LIVES
WITH rLLUMIXATTXG GAS
The report of City Engineer Grunsky
relative to the offer of the Bay Cities
Water Company to furnish this city a
supply of water from Coyote Creek
was tiled with the board. As already
published in The Call, the City En
gineer recommends against the accept
ance of the offer, on the grourid that
the supply Is not reliable. Grunsky de
clares that the company will be unable
to furnish 62.000,000 gallons of water
daily, the prospective amount the clty
will need in years to come.
The petition of the Fruit Peddlers*
Association that the same privilege
accorded the flower venders be ex
tended to the fruit peddlers was re
ferred to the Street Committee.
Supervisor Rea opposed the ordinance [
and quoted from an opinion of the City j
Attorney that the granting of special j
privileges is a violation of the charter, j
and expressed surprise that the Street
Committee had recommended the pass
age of an illegal ordinance. Rea also
quoted from Judge Murasky's decision,
ruling against bootblacks and fruit
peddlers occupying the streets and
sidewalks.
G. T. Wright. Dr. J. A. Wilson and
several ladles addressed the board in
behalf of the ordinance, and T. M.
O'Connor. J. W. Shanahan and T.
Shibely were heard in opposition.
Shanahan produced a one-armed man
who attempted to sell flowers on
Kearny street and was struck on the
head with an iron bar by a rival vender
who was employed by one of three
companies that control the situation.
Boys and old men who tried to sell
flowers were intimidated by the
venders who held the fort, Shibely
said.
The attorney for the Retail Flower
Dealers' Association held that the or
dinance Is In plain violation of the
State constitution, the city charter and
of the board's ordinance. No. 1030,
making it unlawful to peddle goods on
the public streets without a license.
The Retailers' Federation of Cali
fornia, comprising the various retail
organizations of the State, filed a pro
test against the passage of the ordi
nance. The protest refers to the recent
clearing of bootblack and peddler
stands from the public streets, and says
that the ordinance proposes to effect
the legal sanction of an aggravation of
the evil on the busiest thoroughfares of
the city. The protest is signed by Will
iam Lenhoff, president of the Retail
Grocers' Association, and H. C. Fla
geolett, past president of the Butchers*
Protective Association.
The bill was passed by a vote of
seventeen for to one against. Rea being
the only one to vote against it. Lun
stedt tried to have the section desig
nating the sidewalks of Market, Powell
and Eddy streets as free markets ex
cluded from the privileges, but only
six votes were recorded in the af
firmative.
The Board of Supervisors yesterday
passed to print the ordinance sub
mitted by the Merchants* Association,
designating certain locations on pub
lic sidewalks to be used as free public
flower markets, where street peddlers
may pursue their trade.

peler. who has to misuse a very pretty

we can promise to like him, Mr. Fish

but large. Half a dozen sextet men
are features of it. and the aforesaid

Brine's song, "There's a Girl Wanted
There," got the laugh of the evening.
BLANCHE PARTINGTON.
It takes nine tailors to make & man;
It took five men to make "The Silver
Slipper," as seen for 'the first time here
last night at the Columbia Theater â
pardon, Mr. Pallma, six, for where
would "The Silver Slipper" be without
the immaculate gants of the erstwhile
"Florodora" leader! Therp is an old
Baying. "Too many, cooks spoil the
broth." It is to wonder if this be
what ails these later opera-cobblings
from Lunnon? Besides the original
"Florodora" syndicate, our own Clay
M. Greene has been in at the book,
"Americanizing" it for home consump
tion. These be not to complain of Mr.
Greene's "Weberfieldismsâ that can be
seen with one hand, as Sam Collins
would sayâ but wherefore the rest?
Why not make the whole thing at
home and be done wi* *t?
One wonders, cast differently and
wi.th its authors left alone in their
glory, just how "The Silver Slipper"
would hit one. "Florodora," whose
sextet is flagrantly imported in its
successor, should also be forgotten.
The comedy depends now upon a de
lightful whipper-snapper of a come
dian, Sam Collins by name; a mo
ment of eyeful girl and the famous
"champagne dance." The dance, done
by six English dancing girls and as
many neat males, is a supple and
sumptuous whirl of spangles and rosy
frills and â well, you won't be happy
till you get it. The comedian is also
of the "once used always used" kind.
If there is anything quicker than
greased lightning Mr. Collins is it.
He is as quick as two John Slavinp.
He occupies fortunately considerable
space in the comedy and while his
brusque, fascinating pertnees is in evi
dence "The Silver Slipper" slips. Ben
Lodge, the other comedian, does
much with nothing as a star-gazing
professor.
Edna Wallace Hopper's part of
Wrenne is assumed by Ann Tyrell,
who sings prettily. She has. however,
everything else to learn. Laura Clem
ent could teach her some things, but
Miss Clement is herself woefully mis
cast. Alice Lessing seemed to be so in
terested in us all that it is a shame to
say anything, but may I remark that
it is usual to look at the person you
happen to be speaking to just occa
sionally? Miss Lessing has the appar
ent excuse of Inexperience, which can
not be said of Louisa Moore, who is
tlresomely inadequate as Stella.
In opposition to this statemejit . the
CommiSFioners claim that an examina
tion of the Auditor's books shows that
during 1903 Baehr issued 144 warrants
to civil service men, calling for a pay
ment of $5414, as against 220 non-civil
Bervice warrants, totaling $12,165 05.
The Commissioners are at present ex
amining' the papers of the 276.appli
cants for positions on the police force,
but do not expect to have the list ready
before the middle of April.
All the regular employes of my office speci
fied in the charter are civil service men. All
temporary appointments so far ae practicable
Â¦were, taken from the civil service lists. There
is grave doubt about my office being subject
to your Jurisdiction at all. That 1 have never
raised this question prove? my friendliness to
the merit system. I am terry to feel com
pelled to turpest now that the office may be
eutside of civil Fervice. In the case of Kahn
vs. Sutro, 114 Cal. 316. the Auditor's office
urder the old consolidation act was declared a
municipal office because the Auditor waa
"made a member of the Board at New City
HaJl Commissioners" â¢ â¢ and "of the
Board of Election Commissioners" in addition
to hie regular duties as County Auditor. Un
der the charter he is relieved of both these
j-ofitior.s and has no duties different from
eth^r county nuditore. IT the question now
crmes before the court I cannot understand
how the Auditor would still be declared to be
a municipal officer while the Treasurer and
Af^ecsor and particularly the County Clerk
Â«nd Sheriff are held to be county officers.
Either all are now municipal" officers or the
Auditor is a county officer with the others
who. like him. perform only county functions.
If you dejire to force this iysue I fhall be
forced to meet it on the above grounds, though
I would prefer to submit to the civil service
provisions of the charter as far as possible
rather than make the contention.
Tour communication of the C4th nit. is re
ceived and contents duly noted. During my
previous term at- Auditor there Â¦were men em
ployed for ttmporary work in my office who
wfit not cej-tlfied by your commission. The
reason for this was that the work was State
work, and It was imperative that it should bÂ«
crrf by a given time. I think in every tn
fti.r.rp the 'a.rt was known to your commis
sion at the time and wan tarity acquiesced in.
It required men familiar with that particular
work and your clerks were either inexperienced
or- unavailable in sufficient numbers. 1 have
always taken all of your men that were avail-
Abie, but the demands upon me were impera
tive, with heavy penalties on ,me for failure,
and hence I went outside your'lists. I f=ubn>it
T.hat in view of the new tÂ«Â»rni of office and
the lapse of time you ar<Â» very late in present.
inj? your objections at this time.
The long-staodlns controversy be
tween the Auditor and the Board of
ClvU Service Commissioners bobbed up
again at the meeting of the commis
sion last night. Auditor Baehr was not
present in person to answer the ques
tions which might be asked him regard
ing his alleged violation of civil service
rules, but forwarded the following let
ter explaining his position:
