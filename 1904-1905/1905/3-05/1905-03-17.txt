The liner China, which arrived yes

j that region of rapid history making
[ some of the people who have shared ;
i in the activity upon which the interest
! of the civilized world for the last year i
[ or so has been centered. â¢ Among the j
liner's passengers, were men who lived
in Port Arthur while Japanese shells re
duced that r fortress and humbled Rus
r ride. There were on thf- China
officers of some at â  the '> many blockade
runners captured"; outside Vladivostok
by the Japanese. . A few of these saw
Vladivostok. I Most of them didn't, and
ail, eventually, were ; captured by . the
enemy of / the Czar.' Captured, .well
treated and sent home feeling kindly
toward the little brown tars whose vig
ilance had prevented the men that nav
i igated the , contraband-leaded | vessels
! from adding a liberal bonus to agener
1 our wage. On board the China was a
little army of skilled â  mechanics who
for more than a year 'have been iso
lated on lonely Midway Island, build
ing homes and offices for the men in
charge of the cable station. Another
passenger is a member of one of the
world's greatest shipbuilding firms.
There was a Wall street man, .home
from a hunt after financial -bargains,
and a Japanese doctor, recently mar-,
ried and returning to America to find
that his pretty bride may not be al
lowed to land on American soil because
one of Uncle Sam's eagle-eyed sur
geons finds in her eyes traces of a trou
ble that, is. classed officially with the
"not wanted." *
Five captured blockade running
steamers were represented among : the
China's passengers. All the captains
of the captured vessels are still in Ja
pan acting as representatives of the
underwriters and awaiting some mod
ification of the prize court's order of

ocean on the China were deck and en
j gineer officers.
The ships they left behind them are
I the British steamers Oakley, Rosalie,
! Lethington and Bawtry, Dutch steam
:er Wilhelmina and the M. S. Dollar,
i under the British flag, but. owned in
San Francisco.
The Wilhelmina, with a cargo of coal
from Barry, and the Bawtry, with coal
i from Cardiff, succeeded in getting into
Vladivostok early in November. The
Russians paid well for the cargoes and
all hands received a liberal bonus. The
Wilhelmina , returned to Shanghai, the
Bawtry. "I don't think much of Rus

and foodstuffs, essayed to enter . ":'â  the
Russian port once more. By this time"
the Japanese blockade was in good
working order, and both vessels were
captured.
Chief Officer de Vries of the Wilhel
mina says that the Russians treated
j them : with scant courtesy. This dis
courtesy rankled in the bosoms of ; the
Hollanders and all hands were delight
ed when the Japanese gunboat barred
their way on the second trip.
"We were in Vladivostok in .Novem

Bawtry. "I don't think much of Rus

Special Dispatch to The Call.
MONTEREY, Mexico, March 18.â
With the refusal of Eugene Zimmer
man, who is reported to be negotiat
ing for control of the Mexican Central
Railroad, to procure a special train for
his son-in-law, the I>uke of Manches
ter, the latter's tour of Mexico with a
party of distinguished guests has come
to an abrupt end. The Duke, the
Duchess and their retinue of servants
have left for Mexico City, preparatory
to returning to the United States.
Bulletins of the progress of the ducal
party have been received regularly by
Zimmerman in his home in Cincinnati,
and it is rumored that he did not ap
prove of the tour. A recent acquisition
to the party was James Henry Smith
("Silent" Smith), the New York multi
millionaire. Smith took his leave of
the party in Tampico. Rumor has it
that the Duke of Manchester and
Smith did not prove congenial travel
ing companion?.
It is known that the expenses of
the trip to the Sierras and back again
were met by Zimmerman. He is re
ported to have been keenly disap
pointed when the bulletins informed*
him several weeks ago that after a
meeting 1 between the members of the â 
Gould party and his son-in-law, the j
{ Duke of Manchester had withdrawn,
owing to the absence of congeniality.
Since that time the movements of
the Duke's party have been some- j
what erratic and bulletins to Zimmer
man have been increasing in number.
The Duke wired to his father-in
law a few days ago for a continuance
of the favor by which the special
trains had been obtained. Requests
made subsequently upon the raiiroad
authorities indicated that the, order
for "specials" for the ducal party had

special car was coupled to a regular
train thereafter.

COLORADO SPRINGS, March 16. â
Friends of Mr. and Mrs. Wilkie L. Ed
wards have been Informed that a stork
is about to leave its precious burden
In a splendid home which the couple
are occupying on Van Ness avenue In
San Francisco. The coming of the
stork has reunited the couple.
Mrs. Edwards and her husband be
came estranged in Colorado Springs.
She caused his arrest on a charge of
cruelty, and the accusation caused a
sensation in local social circles, in
which both were prominent. Their dif
ferences were not aired in court, how
ever.
Edwards left Colorado Springs and
soon Mrs. Edwards went to San Fran
cisco. There the reunion took place
several months ago. Mrs. George W.
Trimble, mother of Mrs. Edwards, left
Colorado Springs several weeks ago
to be with her daughter.
It is said that Mr. Trimble intimated
that when thÂ» heir came he would do
"thr right thing." This "right thing."
Leadviile associates of Trimble say,
will br in the neighborhood of $1,000,000
â a sum he could easily spare without
inconveniencing himself. It is further
asserted that he has often remarked
that he would give just J1.000,000 to be
called "grandpa." Mrs. Edwards is
his only daughter. Her domestic trou
bles have worried him greatly, but now
that they have been adjusted he is
lyippy in the thought that there will
be" a direct heir to whom he can leave
his large fortune when the grim reaper
calls him.
Trimble is a millionaire Leadviile
mining man and banker, who has spent
most of his life in the- cloud city ac
cumulating the fortune he possesses.

ST. PETERSBURG. March 17. 1:50
a. m.â With the evacuation of Tie Pass
on Wednesday night the Russian army
abandoned the last stronghold in
Southern Manchuria and definitely
turned over the district to the Japanese
,for the campaign of 1905. At least, no
other strategy is possible for General
Linevitch, the new commander in
chief, in view of . his scanty sup
plies of ammunition and stores, the
shattered condition of his army ajid the
wide enveloping movements which the
Japanese have continued almost with
out a etop since the Russian defeat at
Mukden. Nothing has been heard of
the part which General Kawamura's
army is taking in these operations, but
Generals Nogi and Oku. operating in
the low hills of the Tie Pass irorEe.
were themselves sufficient to turn the
chattered Russian army out of the
fortifications, which had been prepared
with a view to being held by the army
after it should have been withdrawn
from Mukden.
The Japanese evidently are doing
their utmost to accomplish the en
velopment of the Russian*, which all
but succeeded at Mukden, but General
Linevitr-h. with the railway for a line
of retreat, probably will be able to keep
ahead of his pursuers. A constant suc
cession of delaying rear-guard en
counters may be expected.
Military men here have but the
haziest ideas as to where the next
stand will be made. Apparently there
are no more fortified positions in readi
ngs, and the retirement probably will
not â top short of Kirin or Kuan
â ehentzy. on the railway line, and if
the Japanese press the pursuit the
Russians may retire beyond and up the
Sungari River, there to await new
levies, the mobilization of which will
begin immediately In Russia. The
evacuation of Tie Pass involves the
lops of the coal mines in that vicinity.
which, with the Fushun and Tentai
minf-s gone, is a severe blow. The
railway shops at Tie Pass and more
eupp ies were sacrificed. .
A further mobilization has been de

mobilization 1b not known.

The Russians in all directions fought

Of the railway to bring up supplies.
This is thÂ«> first time the Russians have

The Japanese captured enormous

at various places, and it is believed
that the retreating Russians succeeded
in carrying off only a small quantity.

I following dispatch has been received
hy Emperor Nicholas from General
Kuropatkin. dated March 16:
"The troops are traversing Tie Pass
in good order. I have inspected the
Fourteenth Division of Infantry. The
j men seemed in good spirits. Up to the
; time of my departure from Tie Pass
I fighting had not commenced. During

A telegram from the commander

"Individual soldiers and bodies of

Government has been informed thnt
the Russian Emperor has again put
aside all peace suggestions and is un
shaken in his resolution to continue
the war.
All the higher officers of the Far
Eastern army recently joined in a pe
tition to Emperor Nicholas not to
consider peace, asking that they be
given other opportunities to show the
quality of Rupsian valor and report
ing that, although they had retreated
they and the army still had the will

Emperor Nicholas' decision had al

Russia stiH had resources of a char

PARIS, March 16. â The postpone
ment of the proposed new Russian
loan continues to occupy attention in
official and financial investment cir

the loan is not a failure and that an
adjustment of the conditions may
still be reached. One of the bankers
who went to St. Petersburg relates
that during a conversation with Witte
the latter remarked:
"We can afford to suffer a defeat in
Manchuria, but not one in Paris."
This is taken to indicate n strong
feeling in St. Petersburg for all pos
sible concessions to maintain Rus

market.

' of provisions, alongside of which were
j erected Red Cross hospitals, the best
; by far that the Russians had south
of Harbin. At all the other stations
there were also hospital accommoda
tions, so that if Linevitch escape
from Oyama at Tie Pass, he has a good
| chance to cross at the most favorable
! season of the year. Another few weeks
and the roads will be impassable. But
if he is hard pressed there is not a de
fensible position, unless he abandon
: the railway and seek safety in the east
i crn hills. Later In the year, of course,
i the rivers would afford some protec
tion; but in winter, being frozen, they
are as easy to cross as is the country.

Paissian Left Army, Cut Off
by Japanese, Succeeds
in Escaping.
LON-DON, March 17.â From a dis
patch to the Daily Telegraph from
Sinmintin, descriptive of the fighting
around and the fall of Mukden, it ap
pears that General Kuropatkin left for
Tie Pass on horseback on March 8, his
staff following by train the next day.
On March 10 Cossacks began looting
in Mukden and, maddened with drink,
committed the wildest excesses and
robberies and killed numerous civil
ians.
The Russians" retreat from Mukden
station was well executed until it was
discovered that the cordon of the Jap
anese in the r:>ai, two and a half
miles from toy n, was nearly com
plete, when thÂ«f retirement became a
flight. The Russian left army, com
prising some 15/), 000 men, according to
the same dispa'ch, was cut oil by the
Japanese, but if said to have, 1 y forced
marches, splendidly executed . a Junc
tion with the mam body at Tie Pass
in three days.
The correspondent in Tokio of the
Daily Telegraph learns that the Jap
anese left army advanced toward Muk
den at flying speed and in the
last four days covered respectively
thirty, thirty-five, twenty and fifteen
miles. On" force was sent especially
to search for General Kuropatkin and
his staff, but they had already gone.

Wounded 31en Cremated in

GENERAL OKU S HEADQUAR
TERS, Saturday, March 11.â The work
of clearing the second army's battle
field west of the railway was begun In
earnest to-day. The bodies of the Rus
sians are being buried and thcrse of the
Japanese are being cremated.
The battlefield, especially in the vi
cinity of Likampu, five miles west of
the railway, presents a terrible sight.
Fully 2000 bodies are still lying on the
field. This locality was the scene of
the fiercest fight of the left armies.
A division of Japanese attacked Lik
ampu and a small village to the south
and drove the Russians out, inflicting
much loss. The Russians, on being re
inforced counter-attacked, driving out
the Japanese and Inflicting enormous
losses. The Thirty-third Regiment,
south of the village, was practically
annihilated, receiving in front and on
the flank an artillery nYe before the in
fantry attack.
The Japanese were greatly outnum- i
bered when the attack began, and their :
dead were piled in heaps behind the
low mud wnlls of the village. The
RusÃian deal were scattered over the
field, almost carpeting it.
There are evidences of desperate
hand-to-hand fighting near the vil
lage. The bodies of Japanese and Rus
sians are piled together in scores. The ,
bodies show many wounds, indicating
that the men were fighting to the last,
though wounded.
Likampu was the scene of a fierce
street and house to house '*, struggle.
Every street, lane and compound wall
shows Its heap of dead. Many build
ings were burned, cremating the
wounded who crawled into them for
shelter. To seek cover for the ad
vancing troops was impossible on ac
count of the frozen ground, and both
the Japanese and Russian charges were ;
made across the o-pen fields. The fight- j
ing at this point was probably the {
most deadly and desperate of the en- ;
tire v\ar thus far.
The Chinese were not allowed on the I
field, because it was feared that they
would rob the dead.

TWO ARMIES
RACE TOWARD
THE SUNGARI
Great Kailroad Bridge the
Goal for Which Each
Is Striving.
Rumor That Russians Will
31ake Vladivostok
Their Base.
LONDON, March 17.â An uncon
firmed report from St. Petersburg
states that General Kuropatkin will re
treat not to Harbin, but to Kirin and
Vladivostok. This, however, is regard
ed here as quite improbable, and the
ensuing fortnight is expected to wit
ness a keen race between the Russians
and Japanese for the great railway
bridge i.ver the Sungari River, as it is
believed that after Tie Pass there Is
no fortified place of sufficient strength
at which to make a stand until the
Russians reach Harbin. If Kuropatkin
should be able to make a successful
retirement thither it is likely that he
would be able to add some 50,000 fresh
troops to his exhausted army.
A question discussed here is the pos
sibility of Russia evacuating Vladivos
tok and concentrating its garrison at
Harbin. Â .
Various reports giving the alleged
terms on which Russia has obtained a
loan through the French syndicate are
current here and on the continent.
These reports are conflicting in details,
but agree that the loan is for a short
tei-m; that the amount is about |l-0,
000,000 and the rate about 90.
KILAUEA STILL
SPITTING FIRE
Special Dinpatch to ThÂ» CalL
HONOLULU, March 16.â The whole
floor of the crater of Kilauea is covered
with lava which is in constant action.
The pit is filling up rapidly. When the
outbreak first occurred there was a
sudden roar and a stream of fire burst
out of the stde of the pit about six hun
dred feet from the top and one hun
dred feet from the bottom. With the
emission of lava came terrific ex
plosions which sent boulders weigh
ing many tons high in the air. These
would fall back on the side of the pit
and then go rumbling down to the bot
tom like fireballs, many times enlarged,
from a Roman candle.
Unlike the outbreak a few years ago.
when visitors had sometimes to wait
hours for a display of the pyrotechnics,
the explosions at this time are almost
continuous. And it was due to this
fact as much as anything that the fire
apparently ceased a few nights later,
the force of the outburst causing the
side of the "pit for several hundred feet
to fall in and bank the fire. As the
gas accumulated this mass of earth
and rock was forced aside and the
outbreak increased in ferocity and is
increasing hourly.
What was seen of the volcano in ten i
minutes is thuÂ» described by Dr. Ar- !
c-her Irwin, a visitor to Hawaii:
"I arrived at the Volcano House at
la. m. I left the house at 5:30 a- m..
arriving at the edge of the hot pot !
about 5:50. Suddenly the whole bot
tom of the crater became one living
mass of molten lava. From the mid- :
die a stream of liquid fire poured and '
before my awe-stricken gaze there was '
formed a lake about one acre in area I
of bubbling, spouting fire.
"The remarkable feature of it all j
was the rapid manner in which the
red mass blackened."

BERLIN. March 16.â That the war

sia is seen from the fact that orders
have been given for the mobilization
of the troops in Warsaw military dis
trict.
There has been no mobilization, in
Warsaw since the beginning of the

afraid of serious trouble. That they
have now decided to risk this shows
that 1 their reason for carrying on the..

MORGAN MAKES
GRAVE CHARGES
WASHINGTON, March 16. â Sena
tor Morgan occupied practically the
entire time in the discussion of the
Santo Domingo treaty in executive
session of the Senate to-day. He made
a sensational speech in which he
charged that William Nelson Crom
well of New York, who was promi
nently connected with the sale of the
Panama canal property to the United
States, was the prime mover in a
scheme to influence the United States
in the financial affairs of the Domini
can Government. He asserted that
Cromwell waa actuated by a desire to
frustrate a plan of a Mr. and Mrs.
Reader, natives of Alabama, who are
operating under the name of the
Reader Syndicate, to get certain con
cessions from the Dominican Govern
ment and to promote the interests of
a syndicate he represented, which, it
is alleged, holds a mass of claims
again6t Latin-American republics, in
cluding a large part of the debts of
the Dominican- Government.
The alleged disclosures were de
bated all day and the Senate is di
vided as to whether Senator Morgan
made a case. The Democrats Insist
that he did. while the leaders among
the Republicans declare that the
charges were made up of a mass of
matter which contained no conclusive
evidence that Cromwell had used any
undue influence.
Among the Senate leaders to-day a
new plan was advanced in regard to
Santo Domingo, but it deals with the
next session of Congress. It has been
suggested that if the whole matter is
allowed to go over a joint resolution
might be passed by Congress to au
thorize the President to do the very
things that are proposed by the treaty.
It is understood that the plan found
favor when it was suggested at the
White House by the Senators who
called there to-day.
Adjournment of the session cannot
be had until Saturday because of the
situation irl relation to the nomina
tions for judgeships in Illinois, which
cannot be determined before that
time. Treaty discussion will go on
for the two days the session is expect
ed to continue and something more
may be expected of the charges made
by Senator Morgan.

an elective delegate in Congress and
the development of the fact that there
is a strong faction in the United States
Senate that is opposed to the idea of
ever making a State of this district, or
any portion of it, are gaining adher

CONGRESS OF MOTHERS
ELECTS NEW OFFCERS
California Matron Is One of the Vice
Presidents of the Unique
Body.
WASHINGTON, March 16. â The
National Congress of Mothers to-day
elected Mrs. Frederick Schoff of Phil
adelphia president. Among the vice
presidents is Mrs. W. W. Murphy of
Los Angeles, Cal. The congress dis
cussed the advisability of establishing
a newspaper organ and empowered its
board of managers to act in the mat
ter.
having their citizenship blacklisted.
While they are willnig to wait until
Alaska shall have sufficient population
and wealth to maintain a State before
they are allowed to claim a place in
the Union, they want the privilege of
looking forward to the time when they
shall be a part and parcel of this great
nation. If no other way offers itself,
they desire annexation and recognition
as a county or counties of Washington.
ITALY TAKING
PRECAUTIONS
ROME, March 16.â 1n view of the in
ternational situation which has Dre
vailed since Italy entered the triple
alliance in ISB2, she has entirely ne
glected her fortifications on the eastern
frontier, centering all her efforts on
fortifying the western frontier, as
Italy's relations with France were
then so strained that under Premier
Crispi a conflict seemed imminent.
Since 1889, however, the most friendly
relations have been re-established
with France, and the opinion now pre
vails here that all the Italian frontiers
should be equally protected, not for ag
gressive purposes, but so that Italy
may be ready for all possible occur
rences.
The proper authorities have been
DETECTIVES
STILL SEER
POISON CLEW
Burnett Has Three Men
Engaged on Poland
Water Case.
Did Not Use Strychnine
as Tonic, Is His
Information.
"No matter the outcome of the mys
tery immediately surrounding the
death of Mrs. Stanford at Honolulu it
certainly looks to uÂ§, judging from the
information that is available at the
present time, that an attempt was
made to poison her ln this city on the
occasion of her drinking the Poland
water that made her ill. I regard It aa
incumbent on this department to con
tinue our Investigations on the theory
that an attempt at murder was made."
This was the statement made by
Captain of Detectives Burnett last
night. That he is still earnestly en
deavoring to unravel the poison mys- <
tery of January 14 is attested by the
fact that he has three detectives as
signed to the case. They are Ed Gib
son, Wren and Dlnan. Their principal
activities at this time consist of tracine
down suggestions that come ln letters
to Chief Burnett. The malls brinu three
or four of these missives every day.
some offering clews, others mere specu
lations, but every one worthy of at
tention, Inasmuch as a possibility, how
ever remote, the detectives think,
should not be overlooked.
Captain Burnett expects to receive
much aid from the Information that
Miss Berner will be able to give him
on her arrival concerning the Stan
ford household.
"No one knows more Intimately the
private life of Mrs. Stanford, and It is
to her that we must look for lieht on
the many perplexing phases of the
mystery," declared the captain.
"So far as we have been able to
learn, Mrs. Stanford did not habitually
use strychnine as a tonic. According
to Miss Richmond's statement, it would
appear that the poisoned bottle of
bicarbonate of soda at Honolulu was
filled from the package that was an
alyzed here and found to contain no
poison whatever."

safety to the peninsula alons: the East

weakest point, as Austrian territory so
projects into Italy that a hostile army
could reach the heart of Lombardv or
Venetia after a few days' march. A
bill will be presented to Parliament,
making the necessary appropriation for
the fortification of the Italian frontier

Austria Is not justified, Italy's obiect

f*Â»un another pretty victim yesterday ;
v.fa;!e hunting for trachoma. in the
of Japanese passengers on the

uate of an American medical college
and is licensed to practice in this State.
He said good-by to hi* patients in
Los Angeles a few months ago and
v.-pnt back to Japan to marry the
sweetheart who had been waiting for
him in far Nippon ever since he left
the island kingdom as a plain Jap
anese honest-boy. From honest-boy to ;
school -boy and student he worked his
way to the diploma, by the grace of
vhieh he now calls himself doctor. ;
i Wearing his hard-won title with true
Japanese modesty he returned to his
â¢heart and under the cherry blos
soms plighted the troth given years
before.
Mrs. Ikeuchi is pretty and dainty.
Tressed in rich silk robes, designed and
built by some Japanese- Worth, she
looks . more like a quotation from ,
Lafeadio Hearn^ than the real grown
up wile cf a properly crederitialed phy
?irian and surgeon.
Dr. Trotter, however, has no poetry
a his soul. He has no soul at all.
Mrs. Ikeuchi thinks. He Is paid by
Vncle Sam to look for trachoma. He
was selected- for the job because he
knows it when he sees it. Hidden I

pretty wife's eyelids, far out of the lay- j

WILL HELP THE GROWERS
Downpour Delays All Traffic
Railroad Property Is Â£)amaged
LOS_ ANgEL.ES. March Southern
California continues to.be' the storm
center of the State, and rain fell over
the entire section throughout the day.
The earth having been thoroughly sat
urated by the great storm of last Sat
urday. Sunday and Monday, ,the flood
waters ' have turned what by courtesy
have been called rivers .V and \- which
have been dry, yandy washes for years
into muddy, rushing streams. "â  , -1
- The greatest sufferers â  from Xpe pro
longed â¢ downpour are the railroads.
Only. one line the Sunset route of the
Southern' Pacific east of here â is in
operation, and trains over this line are
traveling far behind schedules. The
Santa Fe Is experiencing much trouble
on its: line between this city and Bar
stow, particularly in El Cajon Pass,
'where landslides have repeatedly bur
hid the tracks deep, beneath tons
cf rock and gravel loosened from the
mountainsides by the heavy rains. Five
westbound passenger trains are stall
ed on the Santa Fe line Just east of
the scene of trouble and four between
the pas* and San Bernardino. Other
westbound trains over the Santa '. Fe
have been diverted to the Southern Pa
cific via -Ash Fork and Maricopa. It
ie expected by Santa Fe. officials to get
some of; their delayed trains through
by to-morrow unless further landslides
prevent their movement. V
Three of the long delayed southbound
trains over the coast line of the South
ern Pacific^ reached this city to-day.
They reached a point near Glendale
shortly after noon to-day, but were
there held up again because of dam
aged track. Many of the passengers
secured vehicles at Glendale and ar
rived in this city over the country
roads. The trains had been since yes
terday'afternoon in covering the ninety
miles lvl\\eon font* Barbara ir d ml*
city. There will be no more trains sent
north trum here ; over the coast line
until the track is in shape to carry
them without delay. -
Several trains are still tied up ?at

DAMAGE AT ENSENADA.
Freight lighters in the Bay of Todos
Santos Are Lost During Storm.
SAX DIEGO, March 16.â Rain again
fell this afternoon, though the fall was
not as heavy as that of last night. The
storm has had the effect of again start
ing the rivers to flowing, and as a re
sult the reservoirs are filling rapidly.
For the first time in its history the
big Upper Otay reservoir is full and
the mammoth Sweetwater and Lower
Otay reservoirs contain a vast amount
of water. The storm has done much
damage in San Diego and vicinity. The
streets are in a deplorable condition
and it will be several weeks before
they are thoroughly repaired. Coun
try roads in many instances are
washed out and on some traffic is im
passable. Some San Diego property
owners are threatening to put in claims
against the city for flooded cellars.
In the business portion of the city
the water ran down the asphalt streets
like a river last night, filling the streets
from curb to curb, and in some in
stances rising to the doorsteps of the
stores and the lower part of the win
dows. The indications to-night are
that the storm has blown over, al
though there are heavy clouds to the
north and should the wind shift the
chances are the city will receive an
other soaking.
The steamer St. Denis, which arrived
this morning from the south, re
ports that the rain and lightning at
Cedros Island, which is nearly 500
miles down the coast, were severe. At
Ensenada all of the lighters in the bay
of Todos Santos, used by the St. Denis
and the Curacao in landing freight,
have been blown to pieces.
BIG STORM IN ARIZONA.
Business Practically at a Standstill
Owing to Impassable Roads.
PRESCOTT, A. T., March 16.â As the
j result of the greatest storm period in
: the memory of the white man in Ari
zona, not a wheel is moving on the
Santa Fe, Preecott and Phoenix Railroad
to-night, and the prospects are that
none will be moving to-morrow. A
-southbound freight train was derailed
to-day at Congress Junction and a
southbound passenger train is held at
[ the Aph Fork terminus. All other
trains have been annulled. All freight
trains have been annulled for to-mor
| row and information is given out that
passenger trains also probably will be
discontinued until the road is repaired.
Since February 4 there have been but
I three 'dry" days. After the unprece
j dented rain of three days last week two
j days elapsed without rain, but at 2
o'clock this morning another storm set
in and has continued with great vio
lence all day and at a late hour to
i nipht snow is falling heavily, with no
; signs of breaking. The total rainfall
j since February 4 has been 13.40 inches.
I Business practically is at a standstill
i on account of the impassable roads.
TRAFFIC AT A STANDSTILL.
Trains * are Delayed Owing to * Land

?- SANTA BARBARA. March 16.âTraf
fic south of r , Santa Barbara is ' still at
a Â«tandstlH and seven trains are now
stalled between r this city â  and: Saugus.
When they will move is problematical.
Landslides north and south of Piru
prevent the movement of trains in
either direction. Railroad men say that
fully twelve hours will be necessary
to remove the obstructions. Traffic to
the north Is still open and each train
swells the number of stormbound pass
engers to figures that will tax the
company to handle them. The rain
early this morning was the heaviest
of the storm, bringing the seasons
total to nearly twenty-eight inches.
The resulting damage will be largely
offset by the good that will follow.
The wind has changed to-night, Indi
cating clearing weather. The sea here
is very rough and fears for the re
mainder of the damaged boulevard are
entertained. Some wreckage is
strewn along the beach, but it is not
thought to be from ocean-going ves
sels.
TRACKS BEING CLEARED.
Southern Pacific Officials Work Hard
to Get Trains Tl lroiurh .
Reports received yesterday by Man
ager Agler of the Southern Pacific
Company from the south were to the
effect that the tracks, which had been
blockaded by the washouts, were be
ing cleared and repaired, but under
slew stages. Between Los Angeles and
Mojave the tracks had been repaired
by 2 o'clock in the afternoon and sev
eral delayed trains were started on
their way. Between Saugus and Ven
tura there ware several washouts re
ported and much repairing was done
between Santa Barbara and Ventura,
The tracks between Oxnard and
Montalvo were repaired during the
forenoon and it was reported to Man
ager Agler that it was expected that
the working crews would be able to get
the water out of the washouts- at
Cameron. As this work was proceed
ing under difficulties and the rain was
continuing it was finally decided by the
operating department not to send out
any southern trains in the evening. It
is believed, however, by the local of
ficials that regular trains will be run
ning to-night. The majority of the
trains stalled by the storm In the south
arÂ« being moved with the aid of wreck
ing gangs that precede them. The of
ficials of the California Northwestern
and the North Shore roads were con
gratulating themselves yesterday on
the fact that the present storm had
done no damage along their lines.

ing a cloudburst this afternoon,
amounting to 1.42 inches in a little
more than an hour. The Maricopa and
Phoenix Railroad's roadbed is washed
out and the rails left suspended in the
air for 500 feet, between Tempe and
Kyrene. At last reports the bridge over
the Glla River was all right, but trains
cannot get to it and the liver is rising.

TACOMA, March 16.â A dispatch
from Ketchikan says that Benjamin
Spencer, who was one of the crew of
three of a sloop recently wrecked on
the coast of Gravina Island, has not
been found. It is considered certain
that after reaching land in a dazed
condition he wandered away into the
forest and died from exposure. He
was seen by several men who found
the bodies of his companions, but he
raced away into the woods. The search
for him was continued several days
and resulted only in finding his cloth

through which he passed or by reason
of injuries sustained in being violently

IS NOW FAKING
Damaging Testimony Given
Against Plaintiff in Suit
on Trial at Garden City
OPINION OF PHYSICIAN
Believes That Litigant Hyp
notized Himself to Make
It Appear He Is Paralyzed
Special Dispatch ta ThÂ« Call.
SAN JOSE. March 16â Dr. J. C.
Branner, head of the geology depart
ment of Stanford University, was a
witness at the trial to-day of the suit
of Dr. Dogfe against the Fidelity and
Casualty Company to recover 17100.
Dogge claims that while traveling be
tween this city and San Francisco on
a railroad train he was hit on the head
and badly injured by a piece of rock
thrown into the car. The suit is to col
lect an accident insurance due under
a policy held by Dogge. Dr. Branner
was called to prove the origin of the
rock thrown. The witness testified that
he was thoroughly familiar with the
rock formation of this county. He said
it woufd be impossible to state where
it originated, but as far as he knew the
geology of the country It waa not a
native of any place between Redwood.
City and Santa Cru*. Dr. Branner
stated that the origin of the rock
meant its original derivation and did
not mean that such a rock as the one
in question could not be found at Men
lo Park, where the accident to Dr.
Dogge is said co have occurred. The
insurance company is evidently trying
to prove that the rock could not have
been picked up and thrown a.t Menlo
Park.
Dr. Lincoln Cothran this afternoon
testified for the defense that he be
lieved Dr. Dogge had practiced auto
hypnotism and that he had hypnotised
himself and successfully stood the tests
made to see if he Is paralysed. The
witness said he believed Dr. Dogge
was faking paralysis. Cothran's evi
dence was against Dogge in every par
ticular.
TRAINING SHIP BUFFALO
EXPECTED AT MARK ISLAND
Vessel Is Found to Be In Need of New
Boilers and a General Over
hauling.
VALLEJO, March 16. â In a private
letter received In this city to-day from
one of the officers of the United States
training ship Buffalo, which has been
at San Diego with the Pacific squad
ron, it is learned that the Buffalo will
arrive at Mare Island navy yard with
in the next few days and that it is
very probable that she will haul down
her flag here in the near future. The
repairs to the Buffalo, which Include
new boilers, will take many months,
and it is now believed that the crew
of the Buffalo will be transferred to
the new training-ship Intrepid, which
will be completed at Mare Island on
May 1. This would be a happy so
lution to two problems which have
caused considerable hard thinking to
the navy authorities. The Buffalo is
the only training ship on this coast,
and while it has been the wish of
the Navy Department to place her out
of commission for several months, it
has been Impossible to do so as there
Ir no other ship to transfer the officers
and crew too.
NATURAL GAS SUPPLY
TO BE UTILIZED
Company Proposes to Pipe the Vapor
to Snlsun and There Retail It
to Consumers.
VALLEJO, March 16. â The final
outcome of an enterprise which had
its inception during the big boom in
oil lands in California a few years ago
it is now believed will have an import
ant bearing upon the future indus
trial welfare of Solano County. The
oil well of the Rochester Oil Com
pany, near Suisun, was driven down
1500 feet but no oil was found. A
heavy pressure of natural gas forced
the drillers to suspend operations, and
the property has lain idle for nearly
four years. Now the company pro
poses to expend $10,000 in piping the
vapor to Suisun and Fairflftld. where
a liigh pressure system of the latest
and most Improved pattern In to be In
stalled.
The company's engineer estimates
that the capacity of the well is 100,
000 cubic feet daily, and it is figured
that the gas can be sold to cosum
ers at a very reasonable figure, and
that its use to supply manufactories
will greatly aid thf development of
this section.

Manuel, Eveleth and Wetmore, com

JACKSON~VTLLE. Fla., March 18.â
Meyer Guggenheim, once a picker of
nafa, a peddler on the streets, after
ward one of the most eminent and
conservative financiers of the United
State*, ie dead at Palm Beach, of pneu
monia. He was the creator and builder
of the firm known as M. Guggenheim's
Bon* of New York, famed in the smelt
ing business and the mining world.
Guggenheim was born in Langmau,
- Switzerland, on February 1, 1828. He
had a simple education, learned a trade
and traveled through Europe as a jour
neyman. It was during these travels
that he trained much of the insight into
human nature which was in a good
measure responsible for hi* success.
On a voyage to this country young
Guggenheim fell In iove with a fellow
passenger. Miss Barbara Meyers, to
whom he was married later in Phila
delphia, During his early years in this
country Guggenheim earned his living
as a peddler, like many other immi
grants. He was more ambitious than
others, however, and in 1559 had saved
up enough capital to engage in the
manufacture of stove polish. He pros
pered and was able to establish seven
eons he were born to him in the em
broidery business as soon as they grew
up. AIJ of these sons are well-known
mining capitalists.
In ISSS the family moved to New
York. Ten years previous Guggenheim
hail invested In Leadville mining prop
erty, of which he subsequently became
owner. It developed millions of profit.
With his sons he organized eventually
th* American Smelting and Refining
Company, the biggest corporation of its
kind in the world and capitalized, at
J100.000.000. It controls nearly all the
silver and lead production of Mexico,
Colorado and South American coun
tries.
Less than a year ago, Guggenheim,
who was then a widower, suffered . con
querable notoriety as the result of a
suit for 5100,000 brought against him
by Hannah McNamara. She alleged
that Guggenheim had for five years
been friendly with her and that he had
tv.ice promised to marry her. Guggen
heim while admitting that he knew the
v.orr.an by sight, denied all her allega
tions. Nothing was ever heard of a
settlement of the suit.
Guggenheim's fortune is estimated at
J50.000.000. of which he gave large sums
to charity.

Headache
WherVyour head aches, there
is a storm in the nervous sys-
tem, centering in the brain.
This irritation produces pain
in the head, and the turbulent
nerve current sent to the stom-
ach causes nausea, vomiting.
This is sick headache, and
is dangerous, as frequent and
prolonged attacks weaken the
brain, resulting in loss of
memory, inflammation, epi-
lepsy, fits, dizziness, etc.
Allay this stormy, irritated,
aching condition by taking
Dr. Miles' Anti-Pain 'Pills. ; ;
They stop the pa>.i by sooth-
ing, strengthening and reliev-
ing the tension upon the nerves
â not by paralyzing them, as
do most headache remedies.
Dr. Miles' Anti-Pain Pills do
not contain opium, morphine,
chloral .cocaine or similar drugs.
"Sick headache Is hereditary In my
family. My father suffered a great
deal, and for many years I have had
â pells that were so severe that I was
unable to attend to my business affairs
for a <lay or so at a time. During a
very severe attack of headache, I took
Dr. Miles' Anti-Pain Pills and they
relieved me almost Immediately. Since
then I take them when I foci the spell
coming on and it stops It at once.'

IN REICHSTAG
Herr Bebel Scores Yon
Bulow and the Latter
Denounces the Socialists
BERLIN, March 16.â Chancellor yon j
Bulow and Herr Bebel, the Socialist j
leader, engaged in a bitter discussion j
In the Reichstag to-day . over Ger- j
many's Russian < policy. The Chancel- !
lor's usual composure and good humor j
in debate were disturbed by the al- '
moat savage criticism of the Socialist
chief, who said that Germany's creep
ing before Russia had humiliated her
in the eves of the world and had
brought- her to shame. . *
Herr Bebel laughed scornfully at the ,
Chancellor's "assertion that the Social- j
ists wanted war with Russia. Were
an Insurrection ; to , break outi In Rus-
Poland Yon Bulow would . doubt- '\
less- send a note to St. Petersburg of- !
fering German troops to help In sup- '
pressing it.- â¢ ,
The Socialist-, chief .was twice called
to order by the President of the House.
Herr B^bel read a letter of Prince
Bismark to his wife, In . which he i
spoke .of the '"charlatanry and pom
posity of diplomacy." . . .
Herr. Bebel said It was all very well j
for the Chancellor to; say that the sale j
of merchant ships- to belligerents was 1
no breach of international law, but j
what of the ten German ships among !
the forty-five transports with the i
squadron commanded by Admiral Ro- !
jestvensky? \..-
Chancellor yon Bulb w, after talking I
mildly regarding Alsace-Lorraine and j
affairs of Prussian Poland, exclaimed:
Ach*. Love ".Heaven: This Bismarck letter*
I know it well. Bismarck was busy with di- |
plomacy at the time. he wrote It. Yea. it be- I
longs to those many beautiful letter* he wrote. |
If he bad not been a ereat statesman, what a
great author he would have been. "â¢ : . â¢ â 
Msln'Gott!' I have been in diplomacy thirty
years, and I am.unb'.ased enough to know that
what Bismarck said was quite true."
: Turning to ' the 5 German . merchant
ships In the Russian service, the Chan
cellor said: 'â  - ' '
According to the emphatic assurances of thÂ«
Hamburg -American ..Company the .German
transport ships must not accompany the RutÂ»-
lan squadron. : They may only supply coal in
certain neutral harbors.
The Chancellor reaffirmed that the i
Socialist party was seeking to embroil
Germany and Russia, as it had done,
everything \. possible to embroil Great
Britain and. Russia by poisoning pub
lic opinion regarding the North Sea in
cident. .â¢' . â  ' '-â -.â '.
Yon Bulow spoke at some length on
the danger of the Socialists undermin- !
ing 'institutions, and said he was con
vinced that the -civilized world some
day would unite in- a- destructive war
against socialism. . "

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY. MARCH 17, 1905.
DRINK TOASTS
TO OLD ERIN
Knights of St. Patrick Sit
at Brilliant Banquet at
the St. Francis Hotel
LOYAL TO ADOPTED LAND
Exalting Addresses Are
Made and Letters From
Famous Irish Leaders Read
The Knight* of St. Patrick held their
thirtieth annual banquet in the white
and gold room of the St. Francis Ho
tel last night. Among the assembled
host were many of the most prominent
men of the city, and from bright minds
flowed wit and exalted sentiment,
breathing thÂ« loyalty to America of
the â ons of old Erin and their abiding
love for the i3le they had left to help
upbuild the greatest of free nations.
The guests first assembled on the
mezzanine floor, in the balcony of
which, overlooking the banquet-room,
an orchestra had been placed, and from
there marched down to the scene of
the revelry. The banquets given by
this order are always notable affairs,
and the thirtieth was as brilliant as
its predecessors, nothing having been
overlooked in the way of decoration or
tempting viands and wines. Through
out the eating and the toasts the or
chestra played airs dear to the Irish
men.
PRESIDENT'S SPEECH.
President John Mulhern officiated as
toastmaster, and said before the toasts
were called:
Reverend Fathers, Distinguished Guests and
Gentlemen of the Knights of St. Patrick â It
affords me great pleasure to welcome you to
this, the thirtieth annual banquet oÂ£ our so
ciety, in he nor of St. Patrick's day. The
Knights of St. Patrick is & patriotic Irish so
ciety. Its obects, briefly stated, are to bring
together in a spirit of union and brotherly
love the \arioua elements of the Irish race on
the Pacific Slope, to elevate the Irish character
and name and do its full share in defending
both from unjust aspersions, and to render
from time to time to its members such as- j
slstance as may be conducive to their material '
welfare. We are particularly pledged to In- |
terest ourselves in all movements calculated to j
assist the peopl* of Ireland in their struggle :
against suffering and Injustice, mainly at
tributable to inhuman and tyrannical laws and i
unjust government. But gentleman, thÂ« {
Knights of St. Patrick is also a patriotic ;
American society, and we are equally pledged I
to yield at all times an unfllnehLng and patriotic i
support to the constitution of the United States
snd be ever ready to d;fend the honor of her :
{lug. No man has joined the Knights of St. â 
Patrick since Its organization who has not j
taken this obligation and no candidate, I am
rroua to say, ever hesitated to take It. Of :
all the people of the different nations o* |
Â£uropÂ« who have come to this country in j
l^rge numbers and are- fast being molded Into
the Kre&t American nation there are none i
whose loyalty can be more surely depended on !
undor all conceivable circumstances than the j
Irish, and the reason Is a natural one. I can !
readily understand, gentlemen, what a great j
strain It must be on a man who loves his
country", the land where his kindred reside, â 
the land where the bonÂ«s of his ancestors He
buHed when he takes the oath of naturaliza
tion, pledging his loyalty to the United States
and renouncing by name his allegiance to j
the Government of his native land. With the
Irish, however, the conditions are entirely dlf- |
f-rent. He takes the oath of allegiance with- |
out the slightest hesitation, and It Is one of j
the happiest moments of his life when he can i
renounce officially any claim which the country :
that governs his native land by force has ]
on him. Men of other nationalities take the ;
oath of allegiance once. Irishman renew theirs ,
every St. Patrick* day. All over the length |
and breadth of this great land, In every city ;
and In every town of any size. Irishmen are
meeting as we do here to-night, to renew their j
protest against English rule in Ireland, which â¢
Is the strongest evidence men could offer of i
their sincerity when taking the oath of al- |
leglance to this country, and of their loyalty j
to the stars and stripes.
Gentlemen, In the name of the Knights of '
St. Patrick, I bid 3 - ou a cead mllle failthe.
Richard C. O'Connor, secretary of the '
Knights, read letters from John Red
mond, Justin McCarthy and Michael
Davitt, in which they expressed the
wish that they could be present. Red
mond announced that the prospects of j
Ireland never looked brighter, and Me- :
Carthy said her cause was steadily ad- !
vancing. Davitt made the Interesting j
statement that her one danger lay in ;
emigration. "Her young people are
dying westward, bleeding Ireland to |
death." he said.
Colonel J. J. Tobin, responding to i
"The Day We Celebrate," said the land :
of a man's forebears was the dearest
land of all to him. '"The Irishman here !
loves the land of his birth," he said,
"but this does not abate one Jot from
his devotion to fair Columbia, to whom j
he owes allegiance. In Ireland the na- |
tive looks on the stars and stripes as ,
an emblem of hope."
FITNESS FOR LIBERTY.
Joseph Tobin, in a stirring reply to !
"The United States," said liberty alone
fits man for liberty.
Judge Beatty could not be present, '
owing to the serious illness of his '
daughter. Rear Admiral McCalla and
Admiral Terry made brief remarks.
James V. Coleman, in speaking to '
"Irish Influence in the Upbuilding of
California," said: "No country' owes
more to this indomitable race than Cal
ifornia. Her history would be incom- !
plete without a recital of the trials and
accomplishments of the Irish pioneers."
Judge Hunt delivered one of his wit- !
ty addresses on the subject, "Chivalry, ;
Ancient and Modern." and kept the as
semblage in laughter.
James D. Phelan. James G. Maguire
and others were called on for speeches
and Jeremiah Deasy sang. Sir James
Power, a young Irish nobleman and
cousin of John Redmond, spoke a few
words, he having been brought to the
banquet by Mr. Phelan. D. D. McÃae,
hi responding to "Our Sister Societies,"
made a hit with some funny stories.

HUNDRED CHILDREN'S VOICES CHANT
PRAISES AT THE REVIVAL SERVICES
"Sunshine Chorus"
Is Feature of Big
Daily Meetings
SINGER O. F. PUGH
INSTRUCTOR.
Gathering for the
Little Ones Is
i n Preparation
OAKLAND, March 16.â of the
most attractive features of the great
evangelistic campaign is the "sunshine
chorus" of 15 children that has been
organized by O. F. Purh. the singer
Mho asyists the Rev. H. A. Walton
in th*> revival services at the Eighth
avenue Methodist Church.
Since the arrival of the evangelists in
Oakland Mr. Hugh has devoted much
time to the drilling of the chorus, and
since the beginning of the second week
of the campaign the singing of the lit
t3e r>nes has been one of the features
of the meetings in East Oakland.
It is thÂ» intention of those in charge
of the arrangements for the children's
meeting, which will be held at the First
Presbyterian Church at 3:45 o'clock
to-morrow afternoon, to enlist the ser
vices of the '"sunshine chorus."
Prominent in the chcrus is little four
year-old Oiadys Pugh, the daughter of
the singer, who will sing at the chil
dren's meeting to-morrow afternoon. A
special Invitation has been extended to
the children of the public schools to
attend this service.
The services to-day began with a
personal workers' meeting at the Chris- .
tian Church, eonduncted by the Rev.
J. H. Thompson, and this was followed
at 3 o'clock by an "old folk*' meeting"
at the First Congregational Church,
cenducted by Evangelist Henry Os
trom. For an hour before the time set
for the service carriages, the use of
which had be â¢â â ? donated by generous
citizens, liverymen and others. had
been busy bringing aged and infirm
l*eople to the church that they might
listen to the cheering words of the
evangelist and hear the singing of John
P. Hillis.
Dr. Ostrom choose as the text of his
termon the words of the Twenty-third
Psalm. "The Lord is my shepherd, I
shall not want," and his words brought
cheer and happiness to hundreds who
are- rearing the end of the journey of
life. At the close of the service many
pressed forward to grasp the hand of
the evangelist.
Dr. Chapman and the Rev. Henry
Ostrom exchanged pulpits this evening,
the former conducting the service at
the First Presbyterian Church, while
the latter spoke at the First Congre
gational Church. The regular cervices
were held in the other districts. At the
close of the evening services, the evan
gelists, singers and people from all the
districts assembled at the First Pres
byterian Church, where at 10 o'clock a
brief prayer service was held, after
which, headed by a band, the workers J
against sin marched to Seventh and i
Broadway, where a street meeting Was i
held. The march was resumed through
out the streets below Seventh street
and back to the Macdonough Theater,
where a great midnight meeting was
held.
Two thousand people paraded the
streets of Oakland, headed by the re
vivalists and the Salvation Army band.
The sky was overcast and stormy and
a cutting wind was blowing; but men.
women and children walked the streets
tinging hymnos and holding meetings.
The parade was half a dozen blocks
long, and while one section was march
ing another would stop and hold a
.meeting. It was merely a mass of peo
ple without an organizationâ in some
places thin and straggling and in oth
ers a crowd that reached from street
curb to curb.
The crowd marched about the streets
for nearly an hour and arrived at the
doors of the Macdonough Theater at
ii:3o o'clock. Long before the arrival
of the main parade the theater was
crowded and an overflow meeting was
necessary. The main address was by
S. H. Hadley. . ; ;*
Dr. Chapman will speak to-morrow
afternoon at 3 p. m. at the First Con
gregational Church on "The Christian's
Relation to Amusement and the
World" and at 3:4:. Evangelist Stough
will conduct the children's meeting at
the First Presbyterian Church The
regular evening services will be held
in all the churches of the five districts.

ROUSES WONDER
WITH HIS JEST
Professor Howison Contrib
utes to Literature of
the Big "C" Controversy
ASTONISHES HIS CLASS
University Instructor Has
a Little Quiet Fun With
the Topic of Discussion
Berkeley Office San Francisco Call,
2148 Center street, March 16.
A notable addition to the literature
pertaining to the "big 'C " on Charter
Hill was made by Professor George H.
Howison in his class devoted to the
study of ethics. Professor Howison has
the Mills chair of philosophy at the
university, and is revered as a great
thinker, a distinguished writer and an
Instructor of the first rank. His fame
is continent wide and his thought re
lating to philosophical matters always
commands instant attention and re
spect from the judicious and the
learned.
Humor, however, is rarely indulged
in by the white-haired, venerable head
of the philosophy department of the
State University. Other professors
may occasionally indulge in the merry
quip, perpetrate the scintillating jest,
or even pass out the festive pun of
commerce, but they never have been
able to inspire the extraordinary con
fidence which the university town feels
In a savant who never jests.
It was with incredulity therefore and
unmixed wonder that the campus ha
bitues and the townspeople heard to
day that Professor George H. How
ison had spoken in light and jesting
vein of the "big C " matter, which
for a week has agitated the wise men
of the university. The big "C"' is to
be built of cement next Saturday on
Charter Hill by the freshmen and
sophomore classes of the university as
a substitute for the old Charter day
rush. The big "C" is objected to by
many lovers of the beautiful because
it would, as they say, "desecrate the
hill" and be a "vulgar" blazoning of a
university symbol upon the landscape.
To-day Professor Howison is report
ed to have said in his classroom, while
registering as being opposed to the
big "C":
"I would have it understood that I
am not opposed to a big 'C in the
abstract, but I am distinctly against
a big '(" in the concrete."
Even yet it is being argued that Pro
fessor Hiwison was unwittingly mak
ing a play upon words, and that he
had no intention of scoring with a
clever, mirth-provoking and almost his
toric pun. Opinions on this point are :
divided, and there promises to be as j
sharp an alignment regarding the j
question of "Did Professor Bowisoo
mean it. or did he not?" as upon the
original big "C" problem.
SOCIAL EDENS
ARE NO LONGER
WITHOUT ADAMS
ZOE GREEN RADCLIFFE
OAKLAND, March !â¢Â«.- For years th-> Oak
land society function has been an Ailamless af
iair. Matron and bel.e have alike enjoyed
lvi.i neons and teas in petticoated assemblies,
a frock coat or tuxedn being an infrequent vis
ion. But a change is coming over the spirit
ot our soclal functions. The men have discov
ered that they ai> not so mightily bured, after
all. when they vouchsafe to lend their pres
ence t<> some society stunt, and the ladies â
bless their hearts â are always happier and
m<. re clever when there is a man to talk to,
e\tn though the man lg only some other
Wuffiu'i husband. s>o now it is n<> uncommon
tmng to see nmnes that were icrmer.y dark
ti.tra when the chickens went to nt*Mt now
b a zing with light rrum cellar to garret and
ali\e w.th the pleasant murmur of many
vukej>. V. htoh is as it should be. i rte
i i untry Club has 'lone (and is doing) much to
bring about this pleasant commingling oi clever
men ana lirient women, unu many <.>. tne card
clubs that formerly attracteu members uur
ins the aiternoon hours away from home du
ties are gradually changing their times of
meeting to the evening. Husbands art added
to tht membership or inviteu as guests, and
the men will tell you they are beginning to
look forward to what has proved a delightful
paatirne.
Tuesday evening Mrs. J. Loran Pease enter
tained a 500 ciub. Of course, the men are not
bitter players than women, but the ladies on
this occasion allowed two of the prizes to go
to their male opponents, Dr. Herrlck and Dr.
Gross being the lucky ones. Mrs. F. L. Mc
laughlin was aiso a prize winner.
Misa Marion Smith and her fiance. Roland
Oliver, were dined at the Jack Valentines
Tuesday evening. A party of eight sat at the
prettily decorated board, including Mr. and
Mrs. Valentine, Miss dmlth, Mr. Oliver. Misa
Marlon Goodtellow, Miss Jean Downing,' Stan

A number of ambitious young musical stu

some very promising young amateurs. They
meet every two weeks In the rooms of the P.

giving the programme.
To-day several members had something In

EVIDENCE ALL
BEFORE JURORS
Kiniry's Denial That He
Shot Policeman Smith Is
His Defense to the Charge
EXAMINATION CUT OFF
Defendant Is Asked but One
Question and Relies Upon
Weakness of the Testimony
Oakland Office San Francisco Call, i
1016 Broadway. March 16.
The Kiniry murder trial came to a j
.very quick conclusion to-day after the |
I prosecution had finished. Kiniry wsj
I put on the stand this morning and an- j
j swered one question. It is his entire j
i defense to the charge made against j
I him. His attorney, A. L. Frick. asked
} him "Did you, or did you not, fire a
pistol on the night of November 27.
{ 1903?" The answer to this waa. "I did
not." That was all. District Attorney
Allen saw no way to get any satisfac
tion from a cross-examination on this '
point and he said that he had no ques- i
tions to ask.
The defense lined out by Frick for
his client has put the denial of his
client as the only positive evidence he- \
fore the jury on the subject. He has !
put the burden of proving their case
right up to 1 the police and the attor
neys in the case and maintains that,
from a legal standpoint, the most the
jury can do is to find him guilty as an
accessory.
As there were no measurements made
of the dead Goldstein, it was stipulat
ed that Goldstein and Kiniry were of. ,
about the same height, this being th-i
opinion of those who knew them. This
was an important point and vitiatea
most of the value of the dying state
ment made by Policeman Smith. He
said, "The man who shot me was as
tall as I aa." As it is agreed both !
were of the same height this throws
no light upon the question.
Policeman Smith also said "I did
not get the man who got me." Wal
ter Withers, an errand boy who was
within a few feet of the men when the
shooting occurred, said it was so dark
he could not see them. The men be
ing of the same height and both start
ing to run as soon as the police
man had been shot, the question is
how he could have distinguished be
tween them.
All of the admission? made by Kin
iry to the police in regard to their be
ing out to rob a house are before the
jury. The wheel which he was seen to
have on that night looks like the one
found n<=>ar the scene of the shooting.
| The one supreme question, however.
lin the case and the one which the
) prosecution has endeavored to answer
i is. who fired the fatal shot. Kiniry
says that he did not fire a pistol at all.
Arid the mystery is as great to-day as
it was to the boy witness who stood
within a few feet of the men when
the crime was committed.
As the arguments could not have
been completed to-day and to-morrow
is calendar day the ease was continued
unfil Monday morning at 10 o'clock for
argument.

vith criminal elections, and if this end
ivas attained a great good would corhe
lO the State. While the new Governor
was sneaking a Governor's salute was
booming on the grounds outside the
Capitol.
No hint was given in Peabody's
speech of his intention of resigning.
The joint convention adjourned until
next Tuesday, when it is expected a
report on the bribery charges will be
made.
Governor P*Â»abodv, accompanied by j
Adjutant Genera! Sherman M. Bell and
a number of friends, went directly to !
the Governor V chamber after the con
â â¢lusOm of the inaugural ceremony.
Adair.p had left when Governor Pea
body arrived, but the retiring Gover
nor's private secretary, Alfred Patek,
was still in the office. Peabody in
iuir.fi for Adams and when told that
he had gone, said: "I am very sorry.
[ expected to see him."
Governor Peabody then introduced
himself to Patek. remarking that he
had been seated as Governor, and of
fered to shake hands. Patek drew back
and uttered a contemptuous remark,
which caused Colonel F. S. Gross of
the Colorado National Guard to seize
Patek by the shoulder and demand
fhat he repeat the remark he had made.
Before Patek could reply General Bell
separated the two men.
Governor Peabody remained in the
office about twenty minutes receiving
congratulations from many callers.
A!va Adams was inaugurated as
Qovernor on January 10, the canvass
of the election returns by the General
Assembly having shown a plurality of
votes for him. Two days later
Jamep H. Peabody filed a contest for
the office which he had reluctantly sur
rendered. On January 17 the General
Assembly in Joint convention author
ized a committee of twenty-seven
members (eighteen Republicans and
nine Democrats) to hear the evidence
in the contest and report its conclu
sions.
MAJORITY FOR PEABODY.
Fourteen Republican members of the
committee signed a report submitted
by Peabody's counsel, which found a
majority of 2280 for Peabody. The nine
Democratic committeemen presented a
report declaring that Peabody ha 4
failed to prove his election and recom
mending dismissal of his contest. Wil
liam F. Griffith, chairman of the con
test committee, and three other Repub-
Uc&n members reported that there was
much fraud shown in forty-eight pre
cincts in Denver, but that the allega
tions of fraud in the other precincts
which Peabody had asked to have
thrown out had been disproved and
recommended that the contest be dis
missed. Senator Morton Alexander, one
of the signers Of the majority report,
al?o presented another report which
mended that th*? election of Gov
ernor be declared null and void and the
Lieutenant Governor be seated as Gov
ernor. He subsequently amended his
report by striking out the reference to
thf- Lieutenant Governor, and it then
provided simply for declaring the of
fice of (Governor vacant. Being asked
for an opinion on this method of set
tling the contest, the Supreme Court
pronounced it illegal.
Action on the contest has since been
deferred from day to day. The joint
convention consisted of ninety-seven
members and the Republican majority
on joint ballot was thirty-five. Twenty
two Republicans, however, were op
posed to seating Peabody for the re
mainder of the biennial term and they
finally forced the former Governor to
agree to resign the office to Lieutenant
Governor McDonald within twenty
four hours after being seated.

RHEUMATISM
MAY BE CURED
CHICAGO, March 16.â Hypnotism as
a cure for rheumatism has been
brought to the attention of University
of Chicago medical professors by the
discoveries and demonstrations of Otto
W. Greenberg, a young medical stu
dent, who claims to be able to cure the
most chronic case of the ailment by
hypnotic ppwer.
Young Greenberg's theory was given
a trial in a "physiology" class conduct
ed by Professor Anton J. Carlson. A
helpless cripple from the Home for In
curables was brought to the classroom
on a stretcher and thrown into the
hypnotic state by Greenberg. When
under the mental Influence of the ope
rator the man was told he was to have
the use of his limbs. When he was re
leased he was able to move his lower
limb=, a feat he had not accomplished
for a long time.
FRANCE TO ASK
AMERICA'S AID
PARIS, March 16.â The French Cable
Company has received a dispatch from
Manager Brun at Caracas saying that
a Judgment annulling the company's
concession is expected on March 20.
He does not mention any seizure or
cutting of cables.
The semi-official dispatch from Car
acas says the court has decided that
the New York and Bermudez Asphalt
Company was the accomplice of Gen
eral Matos In carrying on the recent
revolution, and that therefore the seiz
ure of its property was Justified.
The dispatch will come before the
Council of Ministers to-morrow in con
nection with the general consideration
of the attitude of Venezuela toward
the French Cable Company and other
foieign concerns. The company con
siders the decision relative to the as
phalt company as having been inspired
by the same animosity leading to the
action against the cable company.
The indications are that the meeting
of the Council to-morrow will be ac
companied by some exohanges of views
between the Governments in Paris and
Washington.

RAILROAD MEN
ON THE STAND
Give Testimony in Suit
to Oust the Santa Fe From
the State of Kansas
CHANUTE, Kans., March 16.âSev
eral witnesses were examined here to
day in the hearing of the case brought
to oust the Atchlson, Topeka and Santa
Fe from the State.
Foster Allen, local manager for the
I. N. Knapp oil interestSj resumed the
stand. Since yesterday Allen had a
telegraphic correspondence with Knapp,
and this he produced in court to-day.
It related to his complaint to the San
ta Fe agents against the alleged un
just basis of weights for the trans
portation of crude oil shipments. Allen,
however, declined to produce certain
correspondence between the Knapp
concern and the Santa Fe freight de
partment. He admitted that the classi
fication allowing gas and oil to be
shipped under the old rate was also
applicable to independent refineries.
Gardiner Lathrop of Kansas City,
general solicitor of the Santa Fe, testi
fied that he knew nothing of the rail
road officials having held a meeting in
Topeka in January last to secure legis
lation. He also said that he had no
personal knowledge of the recent elec
tion of H. H. Rogers and James Still
man to the directorate of the Santa
Fe.
H. B. Scott, a former director of the
Prairie Oil and Gas Company, testi
fied that R. W. Cummings, E. T. Pat
terson and O. J. Evans each owned one
share of stock in the Prairie Company,
and that the balance of thirty thou
sand shares was in the name of W. J.
Young of Pittsburg, Pa. He professed
ignorance as to where the money came
from to make investments for the
Prairie Company. He said in reply to
a question that the Standard Oil Com
pany purchases the refined product
from the Prairie Company.
PSORIA, 111., March 16.â The Prairie
Oil and Gas Company, the Kansas
branch of the Standard Oil Company,
struck a snag when it reached Peoria
County. The Board of Supervisors re
fused permission to the company to
lay its pipe line from Kansas to In
diana across certain highways in the
northern part of the county, asserting
that the authority lay with the High
way Commissioners of the territory
affected.
HKIR TO FORTUNE FOUND
AFTER A LONG SEARCH
TwelTe Years Spent in Looking for
Man to Whom $90,000 had
Been Devised.
NEW YORK, March 16. â After a
search of twelve years James Travis
of Flushing, L. 1., has been located in
Australia. He ran away from home
fifty-three years ago in a whaling ves
sel and had long been given up as
dead by his brother and others of the
family.
Twelve years ago a wealthy relative
of the family died and willed James
$90,000. Advertisements for the miss
ing man were inserted in newspapers
all over the world. The State De
partment also made attempts to find
him. Travis finally saw an advertise
ment In an Australian newspaper
and wrote to his family. He had been
married, was the father of eleven
children, he wrote, and had pros
pered financially. The legacy he will
now receive has almost doubled in
value.

Yards of a Street Kail
road Company in Omaha
GRABS A LIVE WIEE
Electric Shock Subdues Him
After a Number of* Men
Had Failed in Attempt
Special Dispatch to The Call.
OMAHA, March 16.â A maniac, a mo
tor car and a live trolley wire were tho
principals in an exciting drama on
South Twenty-fourth street to-day. The
maniac, who had been around the new
car barn for some time, suddenly be
came violent, and, eluding all attemps
to restrain him, ran outside to where
several cars were lined up on the track.
He boarded the foremost car and turn
ed on the motor power to its full ex
tent.
The car shot forward down the street.
After going a short distance, however,
it ran on a "V," and, shooting off the
end of the track, sank into the soft
mud of an unpaved street. The car
barn employes then succeeded in tak
ing the maniac off the motor after a
hard tussle, in which several of them
received severe bruises.
Breaking from them with a shriek,
the fellow rushed back to the barn. All
attempts to restrain him failed. The
police were called in and when he found
himself pursued by officers he climbed
to the top of one of the cars, where he
grappled with an imaginary enemy.
Suddenly he seized a trolley pole with
one hand and, reaching up, laid hold of
a live wire with the other.
The shock he received stretched him
out unconscious. At first it was be
lieved he was dead, but he soon rallied
and was starting out on a new ram
page when he was overpowered and ta
ken to the police station. There he be
haved more quietly and answered ques
tions in a reasonable manner. He gave
his name as Edward Mallett and his
home as Vincennes, Ind. He is about
30 years of age.
CIGARETTES STILL. TABOOED
BY HIGH SCHOOL. GIRLS
Misses Stick to Boycott Despite Boys'
Threats to Refuse to Take Them
to Theaters.
PITSBURG, Pa., March 16. â The
boycott which was inaugurated by
twenty-three high school girls of Mc-
Keesport against boys who smoke
cigarettes threatens to become a very
serious problem to the young men of
that city. At first it was looked upon
as a huge joke, but it is becoming
more serious every minute. A meeting
of high school boys was held to-day
at which it was suggested that the
boys issue a mandate against the use
of icecream and soda by the girls.
Not only schoolboys but many well
known men of the city are under the
ban, and there are threats of broken
engagements. The older men declare
that if they cannot have their cigar
ettes they will stop taking their girl
friends to theaters and other places
of amusement. The girls say they
can do so if they want, but that they
will not tolerate cigarettes. Meanwhile
there is no visible decrease in the
sales of the tiny rolls and the fight
promises to be a long one.
SAN FRANCISCO WOMAN
LOSES SUIT FOR SUPPORT
Mre. Benedetta Allegretti Is Denied
Separate Maintenance by a Chi-
OBgo Judge.
CHICAGO. March 16.â A separate
maintenance suit brought against
Ber.edetta Allegretti, a well-known
Chicagoan, by Mrs. Elizabeth Alle
gretti of San Francisco was to-day de
cided in favor of Allegretti. The suit
was instituted to compel Allegretti to
provide support for Mrs. Allegretti
and his youna daughter. The decision
hinged on the defendant's claim that
he was too young to make a marriage
contract at the time he is alleged to
have wedded the plaintiff.
Seven months later he married Miss
Rone Opozzio of Chicago, whom he
claims as his lawful wife.

INCENDIARY FIRE
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CENTRAL CITY, S. D., March 18.â
E. P. Farnham postmaster of this
place and head of the Queen of the
Hills Mining Company, a month ago
became susolcious of the relations of
his wife and Richard Galvin, superin
tendent of Farnham's mine. He soon
succeeded in 'intercepting an incrim
inating letter and taxed his wife with
it.
That night Farnham's home and
business block, including the poatof
fice, were burned. Farnham was ar
rested for incendiarism. His lawyers,
in order to get the insurance, have se
cured a letter from the woman to Gal
vin telling him that she would elope
with him as soon as she could get
money.
Farnham was released on bail and a
few days ago Galvin, who had disap
peared, returned to town. The rumor
at once flew abroad that each man had
threatened the life of the other. Both
were known to go armed.
The tragedy came to-day, when the
two men met on a street on the out
skirts of the town. Witnesses say that
Galvin drew and fired, but missed,
when Farnham shot Galvin dead.
Farnham gave himself up and is now
in jail raving over his troubles, and it
is believed he will lose his reason. His
wife was placed ttnder arrest.
It takes a swift man to pursue a
successful career nowadays.

THE CARQUINEZ BRIDGE.
AMONG the great plans of C. P. Huntington was a railroad
bridge over the Straits of Carquinez. The railroad approach to
San Francisco has undergone several changes. It was formerly
dependent upon several roundabout expedients. Its directness, and
saving of time, first came when Leland Stanford planned the
ry at the Straits 01 Carquinez. His plan was antagonized by en
gineers and boatmen, who did not believe it possible to handle such
c. boat as he planned in such swift water and such a contracted
cc. But he persisted, as was his habit, and the result appeared
the successful handling of the largest ferry-boat in the world,
for more than a quarter of a century has been among the
.-.nd wonders of California.
But for many years the great increase in traffic has required a
better facility for crossing the straits. Mr. Huntington had in mind
Rttpepskm bridge, with an elevating device to raise whole trains
m the present grade of the track to its level. While this would
have somewhat bettered the situation, it would have meant delay.
The present owners of the road desire to meet the difficulty with a
1 bridge.
The stream is under Federal jurisdiction and no bridge can be
â¢ â¢. ithout the assent of the Secretary of War, unless he is over
<l by an act of Congress. The military engineers have refused
absent of the War Department to a bridge on the plan proposed
the company, on the ground that it will obstruct navigation by
g sih and raising the bottom of the San Joaquin and Sacra
mento rivers. The subject is now under discussion. It is of vast
rest to the commerce of San Francisco. We need as prompt and
edy communication by rail as possible, and we require also that
obstruction be placed in the way of river navigation and that of
c un Bay. So this city assumes a waiting and watchful attitude in
matter. The caÂ«e doM not stand alone. The strife between
and water transportation ha? been long. When the first bridge
r the Mississippi was planned, between Rock Island and Daven
port, the river interests fought it. Judge Love of the lowa Federal
District Court enjoined the work and made the injunction perma
nent. The case went to the United States Supreme Court, which re
versed Judge Love, and the bridge was built.
The greatest recent contest between rail and water transportation
was at Detroit. At that city all rail communication with Canada
and through the Dominion to Niagara Falls and thence back again
into the United States has to break and be carried across the De
troit River by ferry. The railways concerned found themselves in
the same situation as that of the Southern Pacific at the Straits of
Carquinez. They must tunnel under the river or pass over it by a
brfdge. On their appeal to Congress against the adverse decision
of the War Department, a hearing was had before the Commerce
Committee of the Senate, which greatly enriched the literature of
-merce. The railways offered accurate statistical testimony to
the vastness and importance of the rail traffic. The boatmen coun
red by a showing that enlightened the world. It was shown that
largest water tonnage in the world passing any water front
MCS the water front of Detroit. Proceedings stopped with this
â¢ -cation and it ht probable that if the railways get any relief at
tfDit it will be by tunneling under the river. On the Hudson
'here \vaÂ« not much strife. The drawbridge at Albany and the sos
sion bridge at Poughkeepsie seem to have offered no obstruction
were built in peace.
In the discussion of the Carquinez bridge several plans appear.
I hie iÂ« that it shall be built by the State as a free highway for all
roarls. and also as a wagon bridge. The mere construction by the
ite will not obviate any of the objections founded in the obstruc
tion of navigation, but will simply transfer that fight from the
:thern Pacific to the State of California, which for aught any one
knows may be entirely agreeable to that corporation. The State could
make the fight free from the prejudices which exist against corpora
lions, and if it won the result to the railway would be the same. It
would secure the desired facility without exerting itself, and this
city would get the better communication which it desires.
It would seem to be within the resources of engineering to
plan a drawbridge that would not interfere with navigation nor im
pair the rivers. Bridge building science has greatly advanced since
the first crude wooden structure spanned the Mississippi. Bridges
are built askew, with ends of unequal elevation and in a variety of
way*, unknown to the engineers who used to worry over the strain
sheets an<j trusses of the old style structure. We have now the over
and the under truss, the cantilever, and a ?tyle of drawbridge in
which the whole bridge is lifted up to permit boats to pass under it.
There is also a tip draw, made upon the same principle as the familiar
gate that closes city streets while trains are passing. It has been
wondered that the Southern Pacific has not gone up the Contra Costa
side of Suisun Bay. to a favorable point on the river, and there put
in one of these tip draws. The objection to it would be that it
would obsolete the present service above Benicia to such point as
the intersection of the old track by the new, probably beyond the
Montezuma hills, and local traffic that now crosses at Carquinez
would have to go around by Yallejo and cross on that ferry.
As the commerce of this city increases it feels more acutely
obstruction imposed by topography. The Puget Sound cities suf
fer no such impediment and ship and car come together at deep
water. Here art must overcome such obstacles as the Straits of
Carquinez. and there ought to be no sorcery required to find a way
to rail communication without obstructing the waterway.
It is a case for the engineers to consider. If one bridge plan will not
do. there is no reason why another should not be considered. By
applying all known and all inventable plans to the structure, a so
n will surely be found.
It should be umlerstool that whether the State or the corpora
>n do the work makes no difference with the difficulties that must
be overcome, and whichever does it there must be no impairment of
water transportation.
MORMON VENGEANCE.
THE Mormon hierarchy has expelled from the church communion,
excommunicated and thrust into outer darkness ex-United States
Senator Frank Cannon of Ogden. Mr. Cannon is the son of
the late George Q. Cannon by one of his polygamous wives. George
Q. Cannon was long the close confidant and private secretary of
4?.righam Young. He was for many years the Territorial Delegate in
Congress, and acquired some notoriety by giving first one wife and
:hen another a taste of official life and society at Washington.
George Q. Cannon was a man of great ability, and as adviser of
'"neham and an apostle of the church had vast influence. His
'a'lrr.t* were varied and were highly cultivated. They were in
herited by hi* son Frank in a higher degree than by any other of
hi? many children. Frank was a potent factor in securing statehood
Utah. He is, irv conversation and oratory, a most pleasing and
persuasive person. But though the church accepted his service gladly
:n. securing statehood and rewarded him by one term in the Senate.
He has not been a prime favorite because he refused to enter polygamy
â¢n the days when it was the rule in Utah. His one wife is a charming
nan of fine ability, and, whether by her influence or natural aver
sion he clung to her and brought no Hagar into Sarah's tent.
After the admission of Utah he treated the church pledge to
give up polygamy as a solemn covenant. When the president of the
church, Joseph F. Smith, admitted under oath in the Smoot inquiry
that he is living with five wives and has forty-three children, Frank
nnon revolted and demanded that the church abide by its covenant
:h the Government, and also that it give up its policy of com
rcialism by which is absorbing the industries and business of
Utah. For this rebellion he has been cast out by the church.
Another -prominent Mormon has followed his example and prob

THERE is an inceaslngr number

the law in one or more branches is a
part of the qualifications required. A
man entering pa an ordinary clerkship

In regard to the compensation for
Government work, intelligent obser
vation will probably confirm the epi
gram malic statement in the news
paper witticism that has lately gone
the rounds to the effect that the pay
is pmall for some public officials, but
that some public officials are small for
the pay. As a rule, the lower positions
in the Government service are paid
more, and the higher positions less,
thar in private business. In most of
the offices advancement is slower, but
that is partly compensated for by the
fact that the pay is higher on the
whole in the earlier years. A man

All these things look as though human nature is asserting itself

j not only a hot time hereafter, but temporal disabilities of a serious

This statement applies to the general
departmental positions In Washington.
A few months ago the statement
was carelessly made In an American
magazine that not 500 of the Washing
ton office-holders looked upon their
offices as sacred trusts to the people.
The author of the statement declared
that public opinion among the' civil
service employes regarded as clear
gain anything that could be got out
of the Government, whether an hour's
time or a railroad pass for betraying?
the Government's interest under the
caro of the employes. Against such
cheap and wholesale charges should
be arrayed the undoubted consensus
of opinion among those who have fre
quent business dealings with the de
partments, as well as among many dis
interested observers in Washington
who have had opportunities to study
the facts that the average Government
employe is neither more or less moral
thr.r the average man or woman em
ployed in private business in any of
our American cities. It will be re
called that in the postofflce scandals
of the past few years the officials in
rlrrted have in every instance been po
litical appointees; not one of the em
ployes in the Â»la3sified service has
been found guilty of any form of cor
ruption. The Government requires of
all applicants for positions in its ser
vice just such indorsement of char
acter as would be demanded by the
head of any business house. It would
li.- as reasonable to make wholesale
charges of dishonesty against 98 per
<ent of the employes of the New York
Central Railroad Company as to make
such rharges against 98 per cent of
Washington officialdom.

GUARDING THE CITY'S MILK SUPPLY.
To the Editor of The Call:
I wish to express my appreciation
of the editorial which recentl> ap
peared in The Call regarding the work
of our Department of Health in guard
ing the milk supply from outside dai
ries. Our efforts in this regard were
commended, but a fear was expressed
that practical results of this inspection
might not follow. I wish to explain to
you our method of making this work
practical: First, letters were sent to
the owners of dairies where conditions
existed in violation of our regulations.
They were warned that unless they
complied with our regulations as to
sanitary conditions their milk would be
quarantined at the point of delivery.
low right down the bank and settle
things at once. But mind, men. no
fighting unless there's need. We'll
try to persuade them to leave peace
ably; if they refuse to go. we'll use
force. I think we can get back to the
post by to-morrow night."
There was little need of caution,
for the ground along the bank was
covered with pine needles and gave no
sound of their footsteps, and the trees
were so thick as to conceal everything
a few rods away. It was only when
they had approached to within thirty
yards that they saw the cabin.
But before they reached it a woman
came hurrying out, wringing her
hands.
"Oh, mon Dieu. mon Dleu!' 'â¢'he
cried wildly. "My husband has been
hurt by a falling tree and must have a
doctor. It is sixty miles and I have a
little baby and cannot leave it and my
husband. Oh. messieurs, messieurs, do
not let him die!"
Le Page was a man of quick thought
and prompt action and of sympathetic
heart. Whirling to his men h^ said

sures has been shown by action on
the part of these shippers and con

have broken their contracts with th-*

NEW ORDINANCE
NOW IN EFFECT
Saloon Men of Napa County
Find It More Difficult to
Secure Their Licenses
Special Dispat h to The Call.
. NAPA, March 16.â A new ordinance
regulating -saloons and the issuing of
licenses to them in Napa County went
into effect this week. It provides that
all licenses shall be granted by the
Board of Supervisors and the applicant
must file a petition for a license signed
â¢y at least six of the ten nearest free
holders to the place where the saloon
is to be located in a precinct. If a pro
test is presented signed by a num
ber of residents of the precinct
equal to a majority of the votes
cast at the last general election
in that precinct the license is to be
refused to the petitioner. To-day the
Board of Supervisors granted several
licenses, but refused licenses to Anton
KiiHha, r. Guillaume, If. Lille and L.
Rahm, on the ground that they did not
have th>- nearest freeholders on their
petitions for licenses. A protest was
presented against the petition of E.
Dafoe, proprietor of a hotel in Monti
cell". Attorney F. E. Johnston stated
to the board that the protest was a
fraudulent one. The matter will be
tried before the board Saturday.
JEALOUS YOUTH
KILLS HIMSELF
6f*cial Dispatch to ThÂ« Call.
SANTA ROSA. March 16.â The most
tragic suicide that Sonoma County has
ever known took place here last night
when Herbert Fowler stepped out on a
ballroom floor and ended his life with a
revolver.
Fowlers heart was torn by jealousy,
and after a couple of hours of brooding
he decided that life was not worth liv
ing. His erstwhile sweetheart, a girl
of 13 years, had given him the cold
shoulder and shown a fondness for the
6ociety of other young men at the
dance. This coldness was more than
Fowler could stand and after a brief
spell of moroseness he decided to die.
In the midst of the dance, when Fow
ler saw the girl of hin affections in the
arms of another man. he walked out to
the center of the floor, and, declaring.
Well, boys. I've only got five minutes
to live," placed the muzzle of a revolver
10 his right temple and gent a bullet
speeding through his brain. He was 19
years of age and had lived in Sonoma
< 'ounty for years.

LIQUOR PLAYS
PART IN SUIT
Attorney Charges Client Is
Plied With Intoxicants
to Confuse His Testimony
TKIAL IS POSTPONED
Plaintiff's Valuables Are
Stolen in Bathhouse and
He Sues for Their Return
Attorney W. H. Tomsky made a
charge in Justice of the Peace Van
Nest rand's court yesterday that his
client. James Galloway, had been plied
with liquor in order to confuse him
in his evidence in the suit brought by
Galloway against the Post-street Turk
ish bathhouse. Galloway had sued the
bathhouse concern, Louis Dajas, as
proprietor, and several employes of the
firm designated as John Doe, Richard
Roe, etc., for the return of a watch
and other valuables deposited at the
office when Galloway proceeded to take
a bath one evening.
Galloway entered the courtroom
when the suit was called for trial. He
was accompanied by an employe of the
bathhouse concern and it was noticed
that Galloway was not In a condition
to testify soberly as to the occurrence.
The attorney for the defendants want
ed to proceed with the case af once,
and asked that Galloway be placed on
the stand. Tomsky objected, but the
other attorney insisted that the case
begin with the hearing of Galloways
evidence.
"Your Honor," said Tomsky, "my
client is in no fit condition to testify
as to the manner in which he lost his
valuables. It is evident that he was
brought here in this condition for a
purpose, and the fact that the engi
neer of the bathhouse is in his com
pany looks suspicious."
Judge Van Nostrand thereupon post
poned the case.
The complaint in the suit states that
Galloway, after depositing his valu
ables in the office, was given a key to
his box, the key being tied to his wrist.
While he was in the "boiling-out" room
some one cut the key off his wrist and
pot his valuables from the office. One
of the employes recognieed the thief
as he was going out and at once tele
phoned to police headquarters. Detec
tive Ryan was detailed on the case,
bat the thief has not been arrested or
the valuables recovered.

CLUNIE MAKES
GRAVE CHARGE
Says Inventory of Estate of
Late Capitalist Has Been
Boldly Tampered With
CHAEGE FLATLY DENIED
Executor Bridgford Asserts
Only Change 3lade Was
With Consent of the Court
Now comes Andrew J. Clunie, as
residuary legatee of the estate of the
late Thomas J. Clunie, with the claim
that the records of the probate pro
ceedings have been tampered with, that
some one has been guilty of felonious
hocus pocus, for it is a felony to mu
tilate the records of the courts of the
State. Clunie sets forth no claim that
felony has been done. All he says is
that the records have been tampered
with; the statute books do the rest.
Clunle's charge is contained In his
protest to the petition of Executors
Bridgford and White for distribution to
them under the trust provision of
Thomas J. Clunie'B will of the Clunie
building at the southwest corner of
California and Montgomery streets.
Before proceeding to set forth his legal
objections to such distribution, Andrew
J. Clunie says that the inventory of
decedent's estate is not in the same
condition it was when filed, in that it
now contains the statement that all of
the property set forth In the Inventory
was the separate property of the de
ceased. Thie statement, it claimed,
was not in the inventory when it waa
filed, but now appears therein and in
handwriting other than that of either
of the executors or of any party known
to the protestant.
BRIDGFORD' DENIAL.
This charge looks serious on Its face,
but Executor Bridgord says the alle
gation Is simply in line with a policy
of obstruction Andrew J. Clunie has
been pursuing since the estate reached
the courts for settlement. "The state
ment that all of the property set forth
in the inventory waa the separate
property of Thomas J. Clunie was writ
ten in the document by our attorney,
Hudson Grant," said Mr. Bridgford.
"It was written in Judge Coffey'a
court, with his consent and in the
presence of all counsel and in the pres
ence of Andrew J. Clunie. The onils
sion was called to Judge Coffey's at
tention and with the consent of all it
waa written In and that is all there is
to jt. Andrew J. Clunie knew when
and why it was written in, but he saw
an opportunity to raise the point and
he did it."
After setting forth his claim that
the records in the case have been tam
pered with, Andrew J. Clunie continues
with his objection to the petition for
the distribution to the executors of tha
Clunie building. He says that as a
matter of fact all of the property of
the deceased was not separate, but
community property accumulated by
the deceased after his marriage to
Florence Clunie on February 27, 1873.
WIDOW REPUDIATES WILL.
After the death of Thomas J. Clunie,
his widow, who had been bequeathed
valuable property in Saeramentb, in
cluding the Clunie Opera-house prop
erty, the homestead and other realty
in this city, she repudiated the will
and elected to take her share of the
community property to which she waa
entitled. Under such election, it is act
forth, the court entered a decree giv
ing her one-half of such property, and
such decree is now final. Under her
election the Clunie building, of which
the executors ask for distribution in
trust, became part and parcel of the
community property, it is alleged, and
before the question of its disposition
can be determined it Is necessary, Clu
nie says, a construction be placed upon
the will by the court.
In order that such construction be
had Clunie also filed a petition asking
that the court distribute to him svu.h
properties as he may be entitled to is
residuary legatee. The hearing upon
this petition will necessitate a con
struction of the will and the future
ownership of the Clunie building be
determined.
The executors have filed a waiver of
service and consent to the granting of
the trust established in the will of the
deceased in favor of Jack Clunie. This
helps out complications some more and
Judge Coffey has an interesting day
before him as the solver of a legal
tangle that grows with each added al
legation.
WILL CONTEST CLAIMS
AGAINST WILLEY ESTATE
Attorneys File Notice That They In-
tend to Save Gold for Heirs of
the Deceased.
Attorneys Stoney, Rouleau and
Stoney have filed notice that each and
every claim outstanding against the
estate of the late Charles Walter Wil
ley that may be favorably considered
by the executrix of decedent's last tes
tament will bÂ« vigorously opposed by
them. W. K. Springer, one of the
devisees, has also filed notice of ap
peal from the judgment of the Supe
rior Court settling the final account
of Timothy J. Lyons, whose status a*
executor of decedent's will Is some
what uncertain.
Regarding the notice of motion to
set aside the claims of Louise M.
Mulrhead, executrix of the will, and
John B. Mulrhead, late husband of
the executrix, Lyons has filed a waiver
of notice, but under his signature
qualifies his position by inserting":
"This, If I am an executor."
It is the contention of Stoney, Rou
leau (k Stoney, who are attorneys for
the heirs of the late Charles Walter
Willey, that many of the claims that
have been presented against the es
tate should not be allowed, and they
will oppose tftem all in the hopes that
a greater sum will be saved for their
clients than seems possible when the
time comes for the estate to emerge
out of its ten years of bitter litiga
tion.
Wealthy Pioneer Dead.
Ferdinand Reis, a wealthy pioneer
miner and real estate dealer, died
yesterday at the home of his brother,
Julius C. Reis. 2201 California street
Mr. Reis came to California In the

Julius C. and Christian Reis. The four

while un a spree, then hurriedly left St. Paul.
AfU-r drifting about the country for several
weeks he arrived in this city penniless. HÂ«
b&yb his conscience worried him and for that
reason he decided to give himself up to tha
police. He says his father la a prosperous

PROSECUTION
FINISHES WORK
Evidence for the People in
the '*Kid" Goucher Case Is
Damaging to the Accused
DEFENSE BEGINS TO-DAY
Father of the Young Man on
Trial Will Make Last Ef
forts to Save His Son
The evidence for the people in the
trial of Alan (alias "-Kid") Goucher, ac
cused of the murder of Policeman Rob
inson, was completed yesterday after
noon and it now remains for the de
fense to refute the many damaging
statements made by the State's wit
nesses. The principal part of yester
day was occupied by the prosecution
in producing two secondary witnesses
and by the defense for the purpose vi
recalling witnesses to answer isolated
questions.
When the announcement came in the
afternoon from District Attornty By
ington that the State rested, expec
tancy was manifest in Judge Cook's
courtroom. It was up to the defense
to begin, and Mrs. Goucher, who has
been watching the progress of a trial
that may mean th* death of her son,
paled perceptibly.
Robinson's sister, who has frequent
ly been in attendance at the trials,
looked expectantly at Senator Gouch
er, who is defending his son. The
murdered policeman was the sole sup
port of the sister and an aged mother,
who since the news of her son's un
timely end has never left a sick bed.
The counsel for the defense, how
ever, made the usual move that has
been made in all the trials of the gang
implicated in the murder, that all tes
timony relating to a conspiracy be
tween the accused and members of
the gang be strioken from the record.
After considerable argument the
hearing of the motfbn was set by the
court to take place to-day at 11
o'clock, when a continuous session will
be held until 1 o'clock. Then an ad
journment will be h,ad until Monday
morning, when it Is probable the open
ing argnment will begin.

FRED E. MULHOLLAND
After five favorites had been laid
away the crowd at Oakland track
â  yesterday leveled on Collector Jessup
in the final event to get even. It was
- the first appearance on a California
track of the crack New York sprint
er, which now races in the colors of
J. A. Murray, the Montana million
aire, but his reputation had preceded
him.
The books began by laying 7 to 5,
a liberal Quotation, and later were
compelled to prune this down ex
tensively until 7 to 10 was struck.
Many did not know whether the horse
was ready to go six furlongs or six
rods. They simply followed the rush
and climbed aboard. If not up to a
real hard contest, the Collector had
speed enough to go to the front and
though Delagoa came rattling along
resolutely at the finish the favorite
beat the mare a neck, only hand rid
den by Michaels. Soufriere closed
with a tardy rush, taking the show.
OUTSIDERS TAKE THE COIX.
' Outsiders in the betting captured
â¢very other purse. A muddy track
contributed to the i^ial uncertainties
of the sport. orough. Teufel,
Modicum and Grenore were the big
- test surprises.
Although I'm Joe had a strong-" fol
lowing that played him to win the
opening scramble for two-year-olds.
Avonella closed favorite. Perrine,
who rode the latter filly, let her
swerve and stumble just as the bar
rier was released, ruining all chances
of success. I'm Joe, the mount of
' Davis, made a bold bid for the long
end of the purse, but was outstayed
and beaten by April's Pride, a 5 to 1
shot. Jakie Jones piloted the winner.
Supervision ran a moderate third.
Seven started in the five-furlong dash
, vvith the weights raised ten pounds
above the scale. The talent seemed
â¢ divided between Pickaway and Revolt,
each closing at 2% to 1. These weight
packing contests were always the forte
of Edinborough, but Harry Stover's
horse was not conceded a sight on the
pot. his odds reaching 13 to 1. He
â¢ was piloted by Eddie Walsh and. out
footing his company at the start, won
all the way. Ike Tullett got up dan
gerously close at the finish with Tarn
O'Shanter, nosing out Pickaway for the
place and losing by half a length only.
Revo., had some early speed, then fell
back, finishing last.
11 Mil BEATS SnELLMOUNT.
Shellmount was never much of a
mud horse, but as he once possessed
a sreck of class he was installed fa
vorite for the mile selling affair, for
which a cheap collection faced the bar
rier. The first choice got to the front
on the far turn and, entering the back
stretch, it looked as if he might win.
â¢ Then along came Stewart, the colored
rider, on Teufel, a 15 to 1 shot, busy as
a bird dog and making progress. Shell
mount grew tired as "Big Bill"
Rickards and Teufel won by a couple
of lengths. Davis finished third with
Foxy Grandpa.
Bob Smith's Del Carina had the honor
of being made favorite for the mile
and fifty yard selling event. The filly
Bppears to have become a confirmed
Fulker, and was never a contender.
When Dora I began to show signs of
weakening In the stretch Modicum
passed the mare, scoring easily at the
wire. After an uneven Journey Bar
â¢ ney Dreyfuss ran third.
Grenore had speed in all colors, and
the result of the Futurity course run
following was in doubt at no stage of
the game. The Rubicon gelding's price
wa* pounded down under a well-direct
â¢A bombardment from 10 to 3%, later
the books laying 5. Perrine got him
away In front, and, stalling off the
challenge of Jones with Gloomy Gus
â won by nearly a length. Saccharate,
the favorite, ran third.
TRACK NOTES.
L. A- Bonsack will ship his stable of
fourteen from Ascot Park to Oakland
about April 1.
Delagoa was formerly the star
sprinter of Bam Hildreth's string.
Admirers of long-distance races will
be out In force at Oakland to-morrow
to witness the running of the Thornton
stakes at four miles. This event, which
will have a value of about $3000 will
attract a small but well balanced field
and the prospects are for a good race
Horatius, Veterano and Flying Tor
pedo are the most prominent candi
dates. The Thornton stake was first
run at the Bay District track on Feb
ruary 22, 1895. Following is a tabulated

BUT FEW APPLICANTS
FOR AUBREY'S POSITION
Office of State Mineralogist Does Not
Appear to Appeal to the Political
Place Hunters.
SACRAMENTO, March 16.â Strange
to relate, the fact that the term of
Lewis E. Aubrey as State Mineralogist
expired on February 23 has not brought
to the front the usual flood of aspirants
that are on the lookout for political
holdings. Several letters recommend
ing various persons for the position
have reached Governor Pardee, but the
tenor of these letters would seemingly
indicate that the men mentioned were
not personally conversant with the fact
that they were being recommended.
Governor Pardee said to-night that
there were no leading applicants for
the position and that as yet but little
attention was being paid to the subject
of filling the position.
JURY FINDS BOSTON MAN

Reed, the wealthy Boston man, who
was found dead in a suite of rooms at
tha Grand Union Hotel, this city, last
Tuesday, died of heart disease. This
decision was reported to-day by the

the body, which gave rise to a sus
picion of suicide, were found to be
remedies for rheumatism and heart
trouble.
GUILTY OF KILLING WIFE
AND MOTHER-IN-LAW
Honolulu Jury Returns a Third De
gree Verdict After Deliberating
Thirty Hours.
HONOLULU, March 16.â The jury
in the- case of E. M. Jones, who has
been on trial for the past five weeks
for the murder of his wife, yesterday
returned a verdict of murder in the
third degree after thirty hours' de
liberation. Jones shot his wife and her
mother in Honolulu in August, 1903.
He was acquitted at a former trial for
the murder of his n|other-in-law, the
defense being insanity
BOWKER IS NOT COMING
BECAUSE OF A DEFEAT
His Conqueror, Owen Moran,
May Be Seen Later On.
No Other Sporting Lights on Board
NEW " YORK, March 16.â Jabez
White, who Is on his way to this coun
try to flght Jimmy Brltt. is due here
to-morrow; that is, the big liner Ced
ric is, but what is the biggest steam
ship afloat to the world of pugilism
compared to the little champion of
England? A large delegation of sport
ing men. most of them friends of Char
lie Mitchell, who comes as White"s
manager, will meet White and welcome
the aspirant for boxing honors. If the
expectations of steamship men arid the
weather reports are true, however, j
White will not land on American soil
until Sunday morning, as the bis
steamship is thought to have been de
layed by gales that have prevailed on
the Atlantic.
Joe Bowker, who was reported to
have sailed with White and Mitchell,
is? not on board. Tom O'Rourke has re- t
ceived a letter from Mitchell, stating j
he did not bring Bowker because of the j
latter's defeat at the hands of Owen j
Moran. Mitchell stated in his letter j
that Moran would) come over here any
time O'Rourke desired. Moran is a lit
tle fighter that Joe Gans picked out as |
a "comer." He suggested that
O'Rourke send for him. No other pugi
listic nor sporting lights sailed on the
ship except White and Mitchell. When
the Cedric docks they will go directly j
to the Delavan, where they will make
their headquarters in this city.
White's coming was the cause for
general gossip to-night as to his '
chances with Britt. The consensus of j
opinion was that Britt would win.'
White is a remarkable ring general and
one of the coolest propositions that
ever donned gloves. He showed this
when he defeated "Spike" Sullivan in
their coronation bout in June. 1902. He
has not fought since that time.
Rickards Still tn a Daze.
Bill Rlckards> and Trainer Green
had not recovered yesterday from the
effects of Wednesday night's affair in
Woodward's Pavilion. Rickards went
about in a daze with a big lump on
his head where Berber's glove con
nected.
Green claims that stage fright over
came his protege from Chicago and
that he was not able to show his true
form. That a lot of people fancied
Rickards' chances is shown by the
betting. The odds went from 2 to 1
to 10 to 7, and considerable money
was wagered at this price.
SAKE IS NEITHER WINE
NOR BEER, SAYS COURT
Japanese Liquor Described in Opinion
Rendered hi Suit to Determine
Rate of Duty.
HONOLULU, March 16.â A deci
sion just rendered by the United States
Circuit Court of Appeals in New York,
involving the duty on sake, means that
half a million dollars must be refunded
to Japanese importers in Honolulu.
The Collector here appraised sake as
a wine dutiable at 60 cents a gallon.
This was appealed to the General Ap
praisers in New York, the contention
of the importers being that sake was
p. beer dutiable at 20 cents a gallon. A
test case, prepared In New York as a
matter of convenience, was tried in
the Federal District Court of that
State. There a result was obtained dif
ferent from the contentions of both
sides. Sake was declared to be neither
a wine nor a beer, but a manufactured
article, unspecified in the tariff sched
ules, and subject to a duty of 20 per
cent ad valorem. The New York cus
toms authorities then carried the case
to the Circuit Court of Appeals and
have lost.
PHILIPPINE INDEPENDENCE
NOT FOR THIS GENERATION
Thus Asserts Secretary Taft In Ex
plaining Administration's
Policy.
WASHINGTON, March 16. â In or
der to allay any misapprehension rel
ative to the policy of the administra
tion with respect to the future of the
Philippines, Secretary Taft made pub
lic the text of a letter which he wrote
to John N. Blair of New York, bear
ing directly upon that subject. The
Secretary states very plainly that the
policy of the administration is the def
inite possession of the Philippines
"for the purpose of developing the
property and the self-governing ca
pacity of the Philippine people.'
What shall be done when the Fili
pinos have reached a condition when
they can safely be trusted with their
own government the Secretary be
lieves to be a question which doubt
less will have to be settled by another
generation than the present.

OFFER OF SITES
FOR STATE FARM
Solano and Yolo Counties
Will Present Attractive
Tenders to the Commission
The bill appropriating $150,000 for a
State agricultural farm is in the hands
of the Governor and there is a pop
ular notion that he will sign it. The
; impression that he will give the meas
! ure his approval is so well established
i that parties in Yoio and Solano coun
ties having available tracts of land for
sale are already presenting the mer
itorious features of several sites.
The selection of the site must be
made by Governor Pardee, Lieutenant
Governor Anderson. Chief Justice
Beatty of the Supreme Court. Benja
min Ide Wheeler, president of the Stats
University, and B. F. Rush, president
of the State Agricultural Society. It is
noted that Lieutenant Governor An

dents of Solano County, but there is
no Indication that they will oppose the
selection of a desirable site in Yolo
County.
The bill provides that the farm shall
be located in a section where may be
obtained first-class . tillable land, and
where location, climate and general
environment is typical and representa
tive of the best general agricultural
conditions of California, and that at
least half of the tract chosen shall
be susceptible of irrigation and under
an irrigation system already estab
lished.
The Yolo Mail (W. F. Mixon edltor>
maintains that all the conditions and
requirements are met with in Yolo
County. In booming this, county the
Mail says:
One of the principal claimants for favorable
consideration is Yoio County, which Is In thÂ«
heart of the great Sacramento Valley, and
which presents a chain of favoring circum
stances, natural and geographical, that point
to her as being an ideal county In which thU
State Institution may well find, a home.
Her fertility is a matter of wonder to
travelers, her climate Is typical of California,
ant! she has an Irrigating system that is not
I surpassed anywhere, the riparian rights to
the never falling Cache Creek having beÂ«n
long established. The people of that section
are taking a lively interest in the farm, in
fact her representatives in the Legislature
have fathered , the bill which finally passed
that body. It waa due to the activity of her
delegates to both â  the ; Republican and 'â¢ Demo
cratic conventions last fall . that those con
ventions Inserted a plank In their platforms
Indorsing' an agricultural farm.
In Tolo County there are not less than a
dcxen sites that meet all requirements of the
bill, and the commission should give them
careful attention.
As Solano County Joins Yolo and
holds a share of the glorious belt of
fertility, the argument advanced in
favor of one county may be applied to
the other. The counties of Napa, So
noma, San Joaquin. San Mateo, Santa
Clara, Contra Costa, Marin. Mendo
cino, Alameda, Sacramento, Glenn,
Butte.and Colusa are yet to be heard
from.
SACRAMENTO, March 1Â«-â The fact
that a bill has reached the hands of
the Governor carrying an appropria
tion of $150,000 to provide an experi
mental agricultural farm, to be oper
ated under the auspices of the State
University, has caused considerable
surmise as to the location that will be
chosen by the commission. who will bo
empowered to purchase the site, if the
bill be signed by the Governor. In- â¢
quiry at the Governor's office develop* i
1 the . fact that as yet no application or
offers of location have been received,
but it seems to be understood that the
people of Woodland, Yolo County, ars
quietly making .preparations to storm
the commission as soon as it becomes
a reality in hopes of having the farm
located in that vicinity. There are also
rumors to the effect that Santa Clara
County will be in the running and also
that a location for the farm in the vi
cinity of Lodi is being talked of. but
no definite offers have yet been madÂ».
LEGAL DEATH BLOW IS
GIVEN SAVINGS BAXK
Defunct Paciflo Coast Society Is B*Â»
strained From Doinc BostnÂ«w
Other Than LlquldadnÂ«.
Upon application of the people of
the State of California, upon relation
of Attorney General WÂ«bb, JudsÂ»
Lawlor yesterday Issued a perpetual
restraining order against the defunct
Pacific Coast Savings Society, forever
restraining it from doing business ex
cept for the purpose of liquidation.
Though the Pacific Coast Savings So
ciety to all intents and purposes has
been out of the active financial world
il is now legally dead, without hope
of resurrection.
The effect of this judgment will bÂ«
to protect in an equal degree each and
every of the creditors of the corpora
tion. Persons who were members of
the corporation need BOfl fear that
any other member will obtain an ad
vantage, as all of the members of thÂ»
corporation will share pro rata in the
dividends of liquidation according to
the amounts which they have respec
tively paid in.
It is not known Â»1 the present time

I Lut it is thought that when the assets

been collected that the company will
be able to pay all that it owes to its
creditors and m-rr'bers.

OVER DECKS OF TRANSPORT.
Troopship in Port
Atter Stormy
m
Passage.
Brings Artillerymen
From the Phil
ippines.
The United States army transport
Thomas. Captain -ynam, arrived early
yesterday morning from the Philip
pines ar-d opened for port officials one
of the busiest days they have hus
tled through for a long time. The Thom
as came into port looking, as usual,
like a newly commissioned yacht and |
th* cleanliness was not all outside, for
Major Devol, in his tour of inspection,
from bridge to bilges, found the troop
ship in the same spotless condition she
tuas when she started for the Philip- 1
pixies. 'â 
Captain Lynam says that during: the .
run across the Pacific the Thomas went I
through some of the heaviest gales and |
?q\ia,Hs he ever saw at sea. .or days |
at a time all hatches were battened
d^wn and the troops were compelled \
to use rtorm gangways in parsing from
deck* to deck. During the heaviest
v. .^ther oil was used and with such
riiccess that although the waves rolled
high hardly a splash of water reached
the transport's decks. â¢
The Thomas brought from the Phil
ippines the Seventeenth. Eighteenth
and Ninth batteries of artillery. The
Seventeenth, commanded by- Captain
â  ; G. Jatley, hap been in Mindanao for
â¢ r> years. This battery was with Cap
i>rshing in most of his punitive
kpeditionfi and later with General
aid Wood. The Seventeenth has
: en in fifteen engagements without
; .-!r.g a man.
< ATTAIN SMITH'S CLEVER work.
The Eighteenth, Captain D. J. Rum
:< Tiirh, has been stationed In the prov
v.: c of Jnlo and also has seen much
e< : vice. The Seventeenth and Eigh
teenth batteries did not land here.
llv.ir destination is Portland and they
w, re transferred in the stream to the
transport Buford, which left for the
> "â¢ inmbia River late in the afternoon.
The work of transferring the artil
lerymen and their impedimenta in mid
stream was made possible by a most
unusual maneuver, skillfully managed
by Captain Ike Smith, master of the
army tug Slocum. The Thomas an
chored off the transport dock. As soon
sp her mud hook had secured a good
piip on the bottom. Smith, with the
Siocum, tied alongside the Buford,
brought the Buford from the wharf and
in id her gently alongside the Thomas.
There was a â till breeze blowing, a
strong tide running and the bay was
mugher than usual.
ISo cleverly was the Buford handled
that not even the paint on either trans
port was scratched. When the trans
ports were lashed together the addi
tional strain on the Thomas' anchor
chain caused the mud hook to drag,
but after a glide of a hundred feet or
t-othe anchor's teeth took a good grip
of the bottom and the two big troop
ifhlps came to a full stop. This prob
ably Is the first time that two great
ocean liners were brought alongside
each other in midstream and it was
done yesterday to the accompaniment
of a baby southeaster and in the rip
ple of a racing tide. And Ike Smith,
who did it all, is no bigger than a Jap
anese general.
TWO ARMY WIDOWS.
There were two army widows among
the passengers who came home on the
Thomas and in the troopship's hold
were two coffins containing the remains
of two gallant officers who died for
the flag. They were Mrs. J. A. O'Neill,
the widow of Dr. O'Neill, and Mrs. 6.
K. Hayt, whose husband, a lieutenant
in the Philippine Scouts, was cut down
by p. Filipino bullet a few weeks after
their marriage. They have brought
home their dead to bury in American
soil.
R. H. McOulloÃh, a former pay clerk'
in the navy and a passenger on the
Thomas, was garbed in a fearful and
wonderful array of uniforms. Upon
his head he wore the cap of a navy
warrant officer. Around his shoulders
fluttered the yellow lined cape of a
cavalry captain. A pair of khaki rid
ing breeches tightly encased his lower
limbs, and resting on black patent
leather shoes he wore a pair of yellow
pigskin spat puttees. He had come
home, he said, to find an American
tailor.
John Fuendel, a private in the Ninth
Battery, died during the homeward
trip, a victim of lung: trouble.

DECIDE ON WING
FOR ST. FRANCIS
Directors Have Bonds for
Completion of the AYork on
or Before January 1, 1907
LAEGK GAIN IX ROOMS
Increased Floor Area AMU
Afford Modem Quarters
for Hundreds of Guests
Plans for the proposed new wing to
be added to the St. Francis Hotel have
been approved by the directors and
work on the addition will begin in
May. Manager Woods said last even
ing that the contractors are bonded to
have the wing completed before Jan
uary 1, 1907.
As recently announced in The Call,
the new portion of the hotel will give
200 more rooms and will include many
needed features.
On the first floor of the addition,
fronting Powell street, will be a
lounging-room for men and women.
The rear part of the same floor will
be fitted up for a dubroom for men.
The rooms on the eleventh and twelfth
floors will be used exclusively for bach
elors' apartments, with shower baths
and exercising rooms attached. A floor
is to be arranged for commercial trav
elers, and a handsome ballroom with
adjacent reception rooms is to occupy
the entiie mezzanine floor of the
wing. The high ceilings necessary for
comfort in the lounging rooms on the
main floor and ballroom will consume
the space of what would otherwise be
used for rooms on a third floor. The
entire structure will be completed be
fore it wijl be connected with the
present building. All that will be nec
f-psary when it is finished will be to
cut out the north wall in a line with
the corridors on the different floors and
connect the two. The only material
changes the neAv wing will cause in
the present hotel will be the removal
of the news-stand and telegraph and
manager's offices to some other loca
tion so that the present space occu
pied by them may be utilized to a bet
ter advantage.

DEVISING PLAN
FOR HUSBANDRY
Promotion Committee Holds
That Benefit Will Come
by Use of Crop Trains
ADOPTS AN IOWA IDKA
Railroad Companies Asked
to Make More Tending to
Improve State Outlook
The California Promotion Commit
tee is taking up the matter of having
a husbandry special for California.
The proposed special will be along the
lines of the corn gospel train in lowa
and Middle Western States, which have
been conducted with astonishing suc
cess. It is proposed that this hus
bandry special shall include the farm
ers' institutes of the University of Cal
ifornia. About 140 California cities
are now visited by the farmers' insti
tute and the husbandry special will
permit the extension of the institute
work.
President Benjamin Ide Wheeler of
the University of California and Pro
fessor E. J. Wickson, who has th* di
rection of the farmers' institutes,
have expressed themselves as heartily
in favor of the crop and husbandry
special. Owing to the fact that condi
tions in California are different troM
thofee in lowa, where the corn gospel
train has made its appearance, the
work of the California husbandry spe
cial will probably be upon lines bet
ter adapted to conditions in Califor
nia. In lowa corn has been giv-n
special attention, but in California
there is no one crop which predom
inates to the exclusion of all others.
Besides the benefits to â¢ be derived
from seed selection and planting spe
cial attention will be given to dairy
ing and the raising of minor livestock.
CAR OF EXHIBITS.
The California crop and husbandry
special will probably contain a car of
exhibits showing how best results are
obtained, and will- also be accom
panied by specialists of the various
lines of agriculture in the University
of California, who will lecture on the
different subjects, and there will
probably also be many others who
have attained special success in va
rious lines of agriculture.
The corn gospel train of the Uni
versity of lowa was first started as the
result of the success of Professor P.
G. Holden of lowa, who showed the
farmers the benefits to be derived by
sowing good seed and interested the
railroad companies to such an ex
tent that they provided special trains
in order that the work might be more
widely extended. To-day there are a
number of gospel trains going through
the Middle West, and a potato special
is one of the latest in Nebraska.
The railroads in lowa furnish these
special trains for this work without
cost to the State. This means an ex
penditure of thousands of dollars by
the railroad companies, which should
open the eyes of the skeptical farmer
to the fact that there is something in
the doctrine of selecting and planting
good seed. The railroad companies
figure that "wherever the corn gospel
train goes there is a prospective in
crease in the corn crop and a corre
sponding increase in crop hauling,
which increases the revenue of the
railroads.
SEED CORN THEORY.
Professor Holden first proved the
success of the seed corn theory in a
series of experiments at the lowa Ag
ricultural College. Last spring he visit
ed about thirty farms near the col
lege, taking samples or the various
seed corn that the farmers had. He
planted these samples in one field so
that the conditions of soil, weather and
treatment would be equal. The yield
In the fall ranged from S to 75 bushels
an acre and the proportion of seed that
germinated averaged from 98 per cent
to less than 50 per cent. This showed
that had care been exercised in select
ing and planting the seed corn the
yield would have been a uniform 75
bushels to the acre. The difference be

SUPREME COURT TEST
Hinkel Is Elected to OffiVp
of Collector on Motion of
< Hinmissioner Mackenzie
The Board of State Harbor Commis
sioners met yesterday afternoon. Presi
dent Charles H. Spear presided and
Commissioners John C. 'Kirkpatrlck
and John ; D. Mackenzie responded to
the roll call. There was a sign of a lit
tle clash when Mackenzie nominated
Â«. B. Hinkel for collector, to succeed
Edward Flanlgan. Hinkel waa elected,
receiving the support of Kirkpatrlck
and .Mackenzie. The president voted
against the change. It is reported that
Hinkel Is a rural constituent of Com
missioner Mackenzie.
Â« There was some discussion over til*
following resolution:
rv Resolved. That th * State Board of Harbor
Commissioners request His Excellency. GÂ«or 5*5 *
Â£ %***: >v * rnor of the State of California.
&>' lre'-)l re -) th / ,. State Treasurer to sell
sum bonds of the denomination of IICOO
each, at public anctlon. to the h i S heÂ« bidder
tor cash, m accordance with th â¢ teraÂ» Â»ct
forth in the an u f the Legislature of the
State of California, approved March 30. 1DO;5,
and known an tbÂ« San Francisco seawall act.
Commissioner Kirkpatrick doubted
the advisability of tendering the bonds
before a suit had been instituted to test
their validity, and suggested that the
Merchants' Association might be ia
duced to take measures to bring the
question before the Supreme Court
President Spear took into considera
tion the fact that capable lawyers had
found all the proceedings regular, and
also considered that bids for less than
par could not , be entertained. It was
remarked that the interest and prin
cipal would be provided for from tolls
and dockage.. No tax would be levied
on real or personal property to meet
the obligation. He fancied that the
bonds would be readily taken at a
premium.
The resolution was laid over for one
week with the understanding that At
torney Davis in the meantime would
confer with lawyers representing the
Merchants* Association.
Commissioner Algeltinger of the
Board of Public Works briefly address
ed the meeting, urging the Harbor
Commission to join with the city to
open a driveway on the south side of
Channel street, between Fourth an.l
Sixth streets. The subject was referred
to Chief Engineer Norton.
The secretary was directed to send
a communication to the Merchants*
Exchange requesting that all flags in
the . city, and harbor be' placed at half
mast on the day the steamship Ala
meda, bearing the body of Mrs. Stan
ford, arrives in this port.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL. FRIDAY. MARCH 17, 1905.
CHURCH WOMEN
HEAR OF LABOR
Rev. C. Stelzle Enlightens
Presbyterian Societies on
Some Economic Conditions
The Rev. Charles Stelzle, former ma
chinist and member of the Machinists'
Association, addressed the union meet
ing of the Home and Foreign Mission
ary Societies and the Ladies' Auxiliary
at Calvary Presbyterian Church yes
terday at the close of the annual meet
ing and election of officers of the or
ganizations.
The Rev. Mr. Stelzle's mission is to
work among the laboring classes. Dur
ing his visit to San Francisco he has
delivered numerous addresses on the
labor problem.
His subject yesterday was "The La
bor question.' and in his treatment of
the topic lie asked why it was the
workingman did not attend the church,
arguing that in many cases it was due
to his social condition. Mr. Stelzle jrave
illustrations of the changed conditions
In economics between the last twenty
five years and to-day, such as the in
troduction of labor-saving machinery,
which had practically brought about a
new social condition. It was a condi
tion, he said, that brought with it a
monotony that in many cases, became
distasteful, besides sapping the work
ingman's soul.
He spoke also of the large number of
Christian men in the labor movement
and held that the tone of organized
labor was much higher than it was
ten years ago.
Labor leaders, said Mr. Stelzle. had
become more conservative. Most of
the trouble had been brought about by
new organizations, which had assumed
new powers. He regarded the outlook
in the labor world as very hopeful, the
tendency being toward conservatiem.
The reports of the missionary or
ganizations showed a remarkable in
crease in interest and receipts over last
yea r.
The Woman's Foreign Missionary
Society of Calvary Church elected the
following officers for the ensuing year:
Mrs. Pauline 1-*. Robbins. honorary presi
dent: Mrs. W. A. Roberts, president; Mrs. H.
B. Finiiey. first vice president ; Mia. H. L. Van
Vr.kle second vice President; Mrs. A. GUI.
recording secretary; Mrs. D. W. Horsburgh,
trednmr: Mrs. Magruder Stone, secretary of
literature; Mm. C. W.* Miller", corresponding
secretary; Mrs. Laura B. Wlbur, president of
baby band.
The officers elected by the Home
Missionary Society were:
Honorary president, Mn M. B. Haight;
president, Mrs. Walter Mead; vice presidents â
Mrs. John Hemphill, Mrs. W. T. Perkins, Mrs.
H. H. Hill, Mrs. M. P. Jones; recording secre
tmry, Mr*. PierÂ«on lHirbrow; corresponding
secretary; Mrs. W. C. Miller; secretary of
literature, Mrs. E. E. Williams; treasurer.
Mr 6. !â¢'. W. Thcmuson.
The officers elected by the Ladies'
Auxiliary were: Mrs. George Mullen,
president; Mrs. Chevalier, recording

A letter from Sacramento to the
Building Trades Council has been re
ceived stating that Governor Pardee
had signed the Saturday half-holiday
for all public offices.
The council adopted a resolution ap
pointing a committee on Labor day.
The names of the commltteemen will
be announced later.
Business Agent J. B. Bowen of Ala
meda said that steps are being taken
to organize a local of the Felt and
Composition Workers' in Oakland. This
announcement met with considerable
opposition from the members of the
Felt and Composition Workers' Union
in this city, from the fact that the San
Francisco union claims jurisdiction
over the entire coast. The matter will
be thraehed out in the council at the
next meeting.
A handsome model of the steamer
Queen, which was presented by Captain
Alexander to the Sailors' Union, occu
pies a prominent place in the assembly
room at headquarters and the secre
tary was instructed to send the captain
a letter of thanks.
<'loakmakers' Union No. 8 is making
preparations for its ball, which is to be
held next Monday evening.
The annual picnic of Sugar Workers'
Union No. 519 will be held on July 29 at
Fairfax.
The secretary's report of the Labor
ers' Protective Union No. 8944 shows an
increase of twenty-one members and
many applications are on file. The com
mittee having charge of the picnic,
which is to be held May 7 at El Campo,
has elected officers and sub-commit
tees. Committees will meet every Fri
day night. A bill of $75 for the widow
of Brother Perch was ordered to be
paid immediately.

to recover possession of a triple mir
ror, small mirror, underskirt, pair of
black satin slippers, pair of black
hose, make-up material and hand
satchel from her dressing-room at
the Grand Opera-house. She said she
had been engaged in the chorus by
Kolb and Dill and by her contract she
was to give two weeks' notice of her
intention to quit. Last Wednesday
she was told that her services were
no longer required, and when she
applied for her effects she did not get
them. She does not owe Kolb and
Dill anything and cannot understand
why they should keep her property,
which she values at S2O.

to the Czar Cleared Up
Special Cable to The Call and New York Her
ald. Copyright, 1905, by the New York Her
ald Publishing Company.
ST. PETERSBURG, March 17.â The
mystery of the letters addressed to the
Emperor by revolutionaries which were
constantly found in the palace of
Tzarskoe-Selo has been solved by the
arrest of a page named Verkhovski.
Considerable alarm has been caused
here and at Moscow by the receipt of
anonymous letters announcing the in
tention to blow up public buildings.
The threat as to Moscow applied par
ticularly to the depots of army stores
destined to Manchuria.
The action of the Moscow Corn Ex
change in voting an address to the
Emperor on the subject of his recent
rescript shows the extent of the liberal
movement, only two of the forty-six
members present raising a timid voice
against the address, which contained a
reference to "liberating the people."
Later even these two signed the ad
dress.
PARIS, March 17.â Father Gapon,
the leader of the St. Petersburg work
men in the demonstration of January

peasantry, calling on them to follow
the directions of the revolutionary
combative committee, forgetting all
differences of religion and race and rise
as one man, armed with a general in
surrection against Czarism.
LONDON, March 17.â A dispatch
from St. Petersburg to a news agency
reports that late last night a bomb
was exploded on the tramway line
close to the residence of Pobiedonost
seff, procurator of the General Synod.

clares Evidence of Pros
perity Is on Every Side

ing in the big estates and selling the

scheme for Ireland has proved a great
boom for the country." said Lord
Charles. "I was recently over there
and saw evidence of prosperity on
every side. The people have now a
great deal of money in banks and lt |
all comes from the products of the i
country. Conditions are going to get
better all the time.
"A great many estates have been sold
and many people have been benefited, j
If they could get back the manufac- j
turers future prosperity would be as- j
sured. I am president of a club which
was formed in London during my
spells on shore, and whose object Is
to encqurage things that make for Ire- j
land's welfare. It embraces persons of
all creeds, classes and political opin
ions and Is very much in earnest."

STOCKSâ The insularity and weakness
which the general stock market showed during
the early trading to-day wu the result of gen
â¢raJ liquidation, rhl*fly for pool accounts In
MttnÂ« up holdings on a further distribu
tion *â¢ loans by the Government from the ser
â¢ra; national banks. ->C
This was the c&use of call money rate going
Â«sp to 4 per cent yesterday afternoon and the
further calling of loan* to-day again put thÂ«
rate up to that point.
We do not think there is an* ground for ap
prehension of any important disturbance in the
tnouey market bÂ«ca,use it would break foreign
exchange to the gold shipping point and put
our barker* where they could get back a large
amount of gold shipped to Paris last winter.
Toe technical speculative position has been
fceiÂ£Â«ed by this reaction.
COTTONâ The cotton market was very Ir
resvjiar and unsettled. It was made m by the
larger offerings of epot cotton South and hearr
*eÂ»!ir.g of futures here for New Orleans and
Southern account and further liquidation by
many prominent operators and commission
houses, who ha\-e been adhering- to the bull
eide for the last tw o months, with some ot
them doubling up on the ehort side for a turn
â we do r.ot believe prices can be forced up
much above the basis of 8c by any purely
epecuJative movemtnt and kept there for any
lenftth of time. We, however, look for a con-
Unusnc* of activity and expect to see euch
erratic fluctuation that scalping for moderate
turns will prove irofi table.

New York Stock Market.
NEW YORK, March 16. â The reaetlonarj
teriQency in the stock market which developed
â with the flurry in the call money market late
ytwerday was continued to-day. The selling
Fr-eTnÂ«-3 due to the Mm* cause, as there was
no apparent change in conditions otherwise,
nor in the character of the report* in circula
tion which heve >-v<^ n the main influence on
tfco speculation for some time, v Great con
fidence was professed on the part of the
speculative, element before the trading began
ti-.at the upward course of prices would be
returned with full force and the "tip" was
circulated extensively that the lons-heralded
Vanderbilt deal would certainly be announced
during the day.- the alleged increase of the
Chesapeake and Ohio dividend being included
in the plan. The market made the ready
rÂ»Fpotjsp to which th* 'interested observers
have grown, quite accustomed, opening ad
vances running from a large fraction to nearly
two point* In many of the prominent stocks.
The first prices, however, were the highest
almost without, exception, and the rapidity
with which they took the downward course
sf-emef^quite forcibly to show that efforts had
b**n made to mark the opening high to afford
a bÂ«> for celling to take profits at greater
achar With the reactionary tendency of
the market established the â  prof essionil operat
ing element attacked prices with great vigor
The treeing e'.omer.t generally has been very
<!istruMrul ot the market for some time and
hat constantly testez! it by making short sales
in the effort to start a reaction. These
efforts up to thii time have as often proved
unavailing go that the professional bears had
become 6<"cldea:>- distrustful. This spirit was
*till manifest by them to-day in the prompt
stfs with which they bought to cover their
short contracts from time to time. The con
sequence wa? a series of recoveries through
out the day. The belief was still professed
that the flurry in call loans was due to re
call of Government deposits and was merely
tt-ruporary. Preparation for the Standard Oil
I dividend is also assigned a* the occasion for
th. shifting of loans. The money rate waÂ»
firmer, however, no loans being made -below
S per cent and tb* rate rising again to a
higher figure late in the da* It was sug
gested that the recent receipts of currency
from the interior has been due to remittance*
by interior banks In preparation for draft*
on their New York correspondents for repay
ment of Government deposits and that the lack
of- this oSsettlnff movement to New York 1*
llfcely to emphasize the movement of cur
rtney toward . the Interior for the future
Ptt-riing exchange weakened. indicating a,
source of relief for higher money. There
â¢ were points of resistance to the reaction in
the day's market, notably the local tractions,
thr railroad equipment companies and Chesa
peake and Ohio. The covering by "shorts"
worked a. material rally all around during
the last hour and the day's declines were mod
*rste in consequence. The closing was Irregu
lar. - .
Bonds were irregular. Total sales par
value. J3.555.000. r.
trnited States bonds were all unchanged on
c*ll.

TELLS A TALE
OF BITTER WOE
Aired George Bluclier Says
Wife Makes Him Sleep in
W:\vn in Bear of Home
asks (orirr fok relief
nuts Division of Property
That He 3iay Have Com
fort and Attend His Ills
If it is a plain, unvarnished tale that |
aged George Blucher tells in answer to j
she suit for divorce of his wife, Emma,
the crown of the closing years of his
Jtte is one of woe, indeed. He filed his
answer and a cross-complaint yester
day. . First, he denies that he treated
his wife cruelly, as she alleges, but
says that during the thirty-five years
of their married life he has done all he
could to bring happiness to his family.
But, on the other hand, he alleges that
for the last rive years his wife has been
guilty of great cruelty to him. He is
â¢ 0 years of age, he continues, and for
several years has been decrepit and
sickly and unable to labor, but this
fact has not kept his wife from inflict
ing abuse upon him. Continuing, he
says: '
About the year IS9S my wile, having come
to th* conclusion that 1 would be able to con
tribute tut very little toward her support,
cv. ins to n> poor condition â â '. health, retuaÂ«J
and has sir.cc refused to permit me to enter
Ey dwelling houss, but has driven- me into the
sirttt. This hutne Is on Killmore street, near
Orecnwicli. but my wile, refusing to permit
m< to enter the sane. 1 was compelled to take
up my abjde in the barn In the rear and with
a. few pieces of discarded furniture have made
myself an abiding place, â There 1 am coni
jelled 10 remain at night, while my wife and
the children, to whom I gave life and upon
whom ! showered every attention and whom 1 ;
endeavored to raise to useful manhood and
wominhood, sleep in comfortable apartments
and warm beds.
In order to make a livelihood while thus
living the life of an outcast, I have, when
ever opportunity afforded, done, the work of a
:arm laborer upon the premises and farms
owned by my brothers and sisters Â«nd when
no such opportunity offered 1 engaged In chick
en raisinp. selling their eggs and In this man
ner ekms out a lone and miserable existence,
suffering the j'H" of old age. sickness and
rheumatism and not evÂ»n being permitted to
warm myself at thÂ» stove in the house, even
in the coldest weather.-
ASKS SHAKE OF PROPERTY.
In conclusion, the aged defendant
asks that the court deny his wife a de
cree, but that the same be awarded to
him: that their property be declared to
be community property and that he be
given his share of the same and per
mitted to so dispose of the same that !
once again he may be permitted to se- j
cure Cor himself such comforts as his
age and the condition of his health re- ;
quire.
Frank McClenegan, whose wife.
Marguerite, is suing him for divorce on
the ground of cruelty, has also filed a
cross-complaint', in which he asks for a
decree on the ground that it was his
wife, and not he, that has been guilty
of cruelty. He says that in addition to
other acts his wife, against his pro
tests, has compelled their daughter
Ethel. 10 years of age, to sing and
dance in various vaudeville houses' in
the city, and this notwithstanding the
fact that he has always contributed
sufficient money, to render such service
on the part of the child unnecessary.
He also alleges that his wife abandon
ed him in October of 1894 and took with
her all of their household effects and
his as well as her clothing. He also
ms that after abandoning him she
trent to live with one Joe Soto, permit
ted him to exercise parental authority
over his children, and that since then
both she and Soto have lived off the
earnings of the little girl. Ethel. In ad
dition to a decree of divorce, McClene
pan asks for the custody of his chil
dren. Frank, another child, who is but
2 years of age, the father alleges, la
tbject to the same immoral influences
at are endangering the future of his
tie daughter.
MANY SUE FOR FREEDOM.
â Catherine D. Donovan has sued
'i lom&s J. Donovan for divorce, alleg
ing cruelty. Mrs. Donovan says her
husband is the owner of a dr* goods
business at Ventura worth $12,ub0, land
in Tulare County worth 55000 and min
ire claims at Randsburg, Kern County,
â¢worth $7f.00. She asks for the custody of
her two daughters and $100 a month
alimony.
Susie Asmes Guerrero asks for a di
vorce from Patrick Guerrero for cruel
ty. J. E. Rowley claims his wife, M.
A Rowley, refused to care for him
when he was ill and refused to cook his
mÂ»als when h<? was well. For these
end other reasons he asks for a divorce. '<
Lule M Hertzler has sued Harry
Hertzler for divorce, alleging failure. to
provide. Eliabeth Nordenson asks for
a divorce from Victor H. Nordenson on
the ground of failure to provide.

COUPLE OCCUPY
ONE SADDLE.
Lass Objects to Lad's Manner
and Deserts the Steed.
Youth Follows Her and Then, She Avers, Becomes Extra
"Fresh" and Hits Her Eye With His Fist.
JAMES C. CRAWFORD
Three comely young women. Miss
Madeline Page and the sisters Lillie
and Annie Berger, appeared before Po
lice Judge Cabanies as complainants
against three ordinary-looking young
men. Charles H. MoWilliams. William
Bonilla and M. J. Moran. and the
charge was battery. The prosecutrixes
were laundry operatives and the de
fendants butchers, and the sextet went
riding on three horses one evening last
week in South San Francisco, each
horse bearing a lad and a lass. It was
the cavalierly manner in which Mis?
Page was treated by Mr. McWilliams.
her particular escort, that led to the
courr proceedings.
Miss Page. 18, blonde, and pretty,
told the Judge of how the equestrian
excursion had been . previously ar- i
ranged. "We met these boys on Sun- j
day," she said, "and they made a date
io take us riding Tuesday night. 1
got on McWilliams 1 horse; Lillie rodÂ»*
with Bonilla and Annie was Moran's
company. Mi\Yil!iams and I were in
front, riding along Silver avenue, and
he got so fresh that 1 asked him to let
me get off the horse, but he wouldn't
do it. so I jumped off. Then he jumped
off, saying he had to fix the saddle,
and the next thing I knew hÂ£ was
freph again, trying to put his arm
around my waist. "Don't be so fresh,'
1 says to him. and don't take me for
anything but a lady. 1 Then he hit me
in the eye and knocked me down, and
then Lillie and Bonilla rode up on
their horse and I says. 'For God's sake,
Lillie, get off that horse and let us get
away from these fresh hoodlums,' and
then Bonilla he got? fresh, too, and
Lillie pulls a hatpin and goes after
Mr-Williams, and then McWilliams hits
me again. Then a crowd gathers and
ih^ hoodlums rides away."
Miss Lillie Berger corroborated much
of Miss Page's testimony and addeu
that the eye of that young lady was
blackened by Mr. McWilliams' fist.
All the girls averred that Mr. Moran
Â»iid not get fresh, Miss Annie Berger
going so far as to say that he acted
like a perfect gentleman. So he was
dismissed apd the case against the
other two youths continued till to-day.
In ?uch a nervous state was Mrs.
Johanna Mahoney, charged with ha
bitual drunkenness, that she was lib
erally dnsfi with chloral while in pris
on, and when she appeared before
Judge Fritz her hands and lips were
a tremble and she implored Bailiff
Conlftn to procure for her some of the
soothing drug. The bailiff was then
summoned to the corridor, and when
he walked out of the courtroom Mrs.
Mahoney followed him. so when her
rase was called and she could not be
found there was cpmrnotion. Another
bailiff discovered her begging the ele
vator operator to hoist her -to the pris
on so that she could get the desired
sedative, and when the Judge learned
that she had not endeavored to elude
juptice he gave her only thirty days.
Richard H. Hess, caught in the act
of ransacking a valise in the apart
ment occupied by William Norton at
765 Mission street, was convicted of
burglary by Judge Conlan and sent to
th*- Superior Court.
Mrs. Margaret Marion of 898 Frank
lin street told Judge Cabaniss that
Charles Davidson, a clerk, disturbed
her peace and then mailed to her an
Insulting letter and she desired to have
him punished for both offenses. It
th?n developed that Mr. Davidson and
3klrf. Marion had been "keeping com
pany" and aa tokens of his affection
he presented to her one potted palm,
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, MARCH IT, 1905
â¢ one pair of slippers and one pair of
stocking supporters, which she refused
to return to him with the mitten. His
peace disturbance consisted of his
â gi\ing her a bit of his mind" and
the writing or mailing of an offensive
' communication, which he strenuously
denied. Case continued till to-morrow
and Mrs. Marion instructed to pro
duct- the complained of epistle in
court.
Thomas Johnson, 19 years of age,
was accused of vagrancy by a police
man, who swore that the defendant's
only visible means of support was the
playing of 6lot machines in China
town.
"Do they pay cash when you win?"
Judge Fritz asked Master Johnson.
"Sure they do," was the prompt
answer.
"Well, if they do they are violating
the ordinance relative to gambling,"
said his Honor, "and I will continue
this case to afford the prosecuting po
liceman opportunity to arrest the
operator of the machine he caught
you playing."
Master Johnson said he recently
came from Los Angeles and has poor
but highly respectable parents in Vic
toria, B. C.
John Butler, who makes a specialty
of dispensing British malt liquors in
h's saloon on Market street, told Judge
Conlan that several carving imple
loents had been purloined from his
f r ee lunch table ere he took pains to
detect the thief. The pilfered cutlery,
he added, was on a par of excellence
with everything else in his establish
ment and his steady customers were
eucli a respectable appearing set that
he could not suspect any of them of
being the thief. So he was not much
surprised when he saw John Kegel, a
casual, pick up the big knife and fork,
conceal them under his dingy coat and
saunter carelessly toward the door.
Mr. Kegel was nabbed with the goods
in hitÂ« possession.
"What did you steal them for?"
Judge- Conlan asked the defendant.
"Because I was hungry and intend
ed to pawn them and buy food with
the proceeds," was the whimpering
answer.
"Didn't the quality of the free lunch
suit your taste?"
'Would you believe it. Judge, I
l ever thought of tackling. that lunch?"
replied Mr. Kagel in a tone indicative
of surprise at his own absent-mind-
f r
edness. "And it was both' varied' and.
abundant," he added reflectively. ';" : ;VV{.
"We 11,"., quoth the court, "'for some '
time to come you will be deprived ;of â¢ *
opportunity to ' steal the tools -â¢â¢with

CHARGED WITH
SELLING BABY
Health Board Eevokes Per
mit of Mrs. Bertha Nathan
for a Lying-in Hospital
WILL ERADICATE SWAMP
Property Owners Living on
49th Avenue Given Two
Weeks to Abate Nuisance
The Board of Health yesterday re
voked the permit issued to Mrs. Bertha
i Nathan to conduct a maternity or
! lying-in hospital at 2066 Market street.
! Action was taken on the report of
Auxiliary Health Inspector M. J. White
who charged Mrs. Na^lan with having
recently sold a baby, born in her in
stitution for $10. Mrs. Nathan denied
that she had sold the baby outright,
but admitted that she had accepted the
| money for the expense of nursing the
I baby and the clothes which she had
provided for it. White explained that
it was Mrs. Nathan's habit to make a
charge in the manner stated, but he
I considered that the babies were sold,
I because the cost of the clothes was
| trifling compared with the price de
manded of those who took the babies
for adoption, sometimes as high as $50
being exacted.
The Health Board decided that it was
| powtrless to take any action on the
charge made by White. On White's re
[ port the board revoked her permit.
A permit to keep children was grant
; ed to Mrs. R. Watson, but Mrs. T. Nel
, son was denied a similar permit be
[ cause she had no suitable rooms for
j boarding children.
The board adopted the report of
Health officer Ragan ordering prop
erty owners to fill in a swamp on
Forty-ninth avenue, between H and 1
streets, and giving them two weeks' to
do so under penalty of compelling them
to vacate their premises. Ragan re
ported that some of the owners had
collected the evil, but Francisco Bar
ker, Anna Hundhusen, Emma Sorenson
and G. Landsberger have not complied
with the order.
Miss Ida F. Piatt was appointed
teecher of domestic arts and sciences in
the County Hospital at a salary of $35
per month. MiÂ«s Piatt will teach cook
ing to the nurses in the hospital, the
resolutions on the subject reciting that
the art is of importance to the nurses
that they may know how to prepare
the best possible diet for the sick.
The board set March 30 as the time
for a hearing relative to the vacation
of two pickle factories at the corner of
Folsom and Eleventh streets on the
ground that they are a menace to the
public health.
Sheriff Curtis asked the board to
grant permits for fifty women lndigents
:to enter the County Hospital and
Almshouse. The indigents are to be re
turned to this county from Agnew
State Asylum as cured. Dr. Ward said
the local institutions were overcrowded
as well as the State hospitals, but ap
pointed Commissioner W T orth to confer
with the Sheriff to make suitable ar
rangements in the matter.
Dr. Harvey was requested to investi
gate the complaint of the San Fran
cisco Labor Council that many kitchens
of restaurants and hotels are filthy and
unsanitary.
The dairy premises on the Siegen
thaler tract were ordered vacated at
once, and J. Kenney was given thirty
days to vacate his dairy at Silver
avenue and Princeton street.
Commissioner Hughes was requested
to confer with the Board of Education
relative to the sanitary condition of
schools.
Frank Conley resigned as messenger
at the County Hospital.
Massie Alleges Fraud.

swer in the suit brought against him

of them. Massie enters specific deni.:l
to each of the allegations of the plain

sult of a fraudulent conspiracy en
tered' into between the plaintiff and
George J. G. Marsily and Louis Bart
lett to deprive him of the promissory
notes and to defraud him of the com
mission to which he was entitled tit
the sale of lands mentioned in the
complaint, including, the Chatom
ranch, the notes, he alleges, represent
ing the sum to which he is entitled
as buch commission.

BOY WHIRLED
AROUND SHAFT
William Steieer. an Appren
tice at the Union Iron
Works. Meets Horrible End
CAUGHT IN MACHINERY
Sleeve Entangles in the
devolving Gear and Youth
Is Dashed Against Wall
A careless move of the hand and a
fluffy shirt sleeve were the cause of
the horrible death of William Steieer.
an apprentice ot the Union Iron Works,
yesterday afternoon. The sleeve
caught in a rapidly revolving shaft and
in a trice the young man was entangled
in the gearing and whirling "rapidly
around the steel rod, his head repeat
edly striking the ceiling of the apart
ment in which was the machinery.
Steieer, who was 19 years old, was
employed in the electrical department.
He was repairing a motor when the
accident occurred. In some unaccount
able manner his sleeve was caught in
the belting and his body drawn to the
revolving shaft.
Each revolution of the shaft fluns:
the boy against the ceiling. His cries
attracted the attention of the elec
trician and the machinery was stopped.
Steiger was not yet dead.
The sufferer was removed to the
Potrero Hospital and upon examina
tion Dr. Buell, the attending physician,
found that the skull was badly frac
tured. Dr. Buell had him removed to
the Central Emergency Hospital.
Chief Surgeon Stephen was immedi
ately sought, as the rules of the hospi
tal require the chief surgeon present
at capital operations, but after a thor
ough search he could not be found, so
Dr. Millar unhesitatingly broke the
rule in his efforts to save the boy's
life. An operation was performed, but
the lad was beyond medical aid. and
he soon expired.
Stelgr-r lived at 12 Essex street. The
surgeons at the hospital marvel that
the boy was not killed outright.
PLAYHOUSE MEN
IN ANGRY MOOD
Managers Respond to Sum
mons of Police Board and
Object to Further Changes
An indignant aggregation of theater
managers of San Francisco were as
sembled yesterday morning in the
rooms of the Police Commissioners and,
together with their attorneys, protest
ed long and vociferously over the con
stant changes, they are being com
pelled to make in their various play
houses. The managers appeared at the
behest of the Board of Police Commis
sioners, which in turn had been noti
fied by the Grand Jury that defects
existed in a -greater or lesser degree
in all the theaters of the city.
The Grand Jury, in pursuance of its
policy of following theatrical investiga
tion, have visited ever twenty-eight
theaters, accompanied by an architect,
and in all certain defects have been
fcund. Last Monday the Grand Jury
notified the Board of Public Works
and the following day the Police Com
missioners. A suggestion was made to
both boards that they should summon
the theater managers before them and
explain the nature of the changes to
be made.
The Police Commissioners yesterday |
were inclined to side with the man
agers, who expressed the opinion that
the Grand Jury was "making a play
for popularity!' and holding indict
ments over the heads of the Commis
sioners, bat officially they warned the
managers that the changes must be
made.
Strenuous objection was also made
by the manager:; "to the amendment to
ordinance No. 88 referring to the use of
buildings for theatiica! purposes after
the passing of the ordinance, which
took iilace in 1900. The buildings com
ing under the :Tovisk>ns of the ordi
nance are those occupied by the Em
pire, Baldwin, Belvedere and the Mis
sion theaters. Those theaters exempt
ed in the ordinance as being construct
ed before its passage.- are the Cali
fornia, Columbia. Alcazar. Central.
Grand Or>era House, Lyceum. Majestic.
Jackson and Washington street Chi
nese theaters, Alhambra, Novelty,
Midway. Orpheum. Fischer's. Wood
ward's Pavilion, Oberon and Unique.
At the present time there are injunc
tion suits innding before Judge Sea
well restraining the police from inter
fering with the Novelty, Midway,
Baldwin and Unique. The attorney in
the case was requested to urge Judge
Seawell to render an early decision in
the cases.

"THE VIRGINIAN"
IS A CLEVER PLAY
Owen Wister's Power
ful Novel Reaches
the Audiences.
Dramatization Saves
Stroryg Points of
the Story.
A Wyoming cowpuncher and a Ver
mont schoolteacher descended from
Molly Stark are the principal char
acters in "The Virginian." the play
that Owen Wister and Kirke La Shelle
have made from Mr. Wister's widely
read novel of the same name. The
love story concerns these two. and
Trampas, a regulation "bad man" of
the wild West, represents the factor
that keeps this course of true love
from running smooth. The Vermont
girl has all of the prejudices of her
Puritan training, and the cowboy lives
the rough life of his kind until the eirl
teaches him the better way. The love
story is not finished until a certain
place becomes too small for both the
cowboy and the bad man, and the bad
man is the one who leaves â and by the
leaden ball route, of course. Owen
Wister says that Dustln Farnum. who
is playing the part of the cowboy, is
almost ideal for the part in his ap
pearance, manner and personality, and
it is to be expected that Mr. Farnum
will achieve a triumph here. "The
Virginian" is to be presented at the
Columbia for two weeks, beginning
Monday.
TICKET SALES ARE LARGE
FOR CONRIED GRAND OPERA
System of Booking Is Similar to the
One Followed Out in
New York.
This morning will inaugurate the
next to the laÂ«t day of the mail order
subscription season sale for the mag
nificent grand opera in prospect when
the Conried Metropolitan Opera Com
pany reaches San Francisco.
The advance bookings have reached
a proportion which warrants Messrs.
Strine and Greenbaum, who represent
Mr. Conried's interests here, in declar
ing that the engagement promises to
be as brilliant from a financial stan I
point as it will unquestionably be from
the artistic one. The innovation of the
disposing of season tickets through the
mail order department, which had
nevfr been tried in San Francisco be
fore, has proved that opera-goers in
this city like the custom which pre
vails at the Metropolitan Opera-house
in New York of booking their sittings
by letter. The Conried office in the
Orand Opera-house resembles a bee
hive and the Jingle of gold coin makes
merry music.
When the mail order 'sale is brought
to. a close to-morrow evening the
preparations for the box office season
sale, which goes on at the Grand
Opera-house on Monday morning, will
begin. This sale will continue until
Saturday evening, March 25. and opera
patrons who want to attend the entire
series of twelve performances or those
vho prefer a season of eight presenta
tions (which includes all the operas
announced without any repetitions)
will be accommodated at the box of
l:ce. where plans of the different floors
will be displayed.
This does not mean that the mail
order department will be close. On
the contrary, season orders will still
le booked that way. The box of
fice season sale, however, will accom
modate a large number of people who
n.ay prefer to select their seats in the
old way.
BARNEY BERNARD WILL STAR.
Clever Comedian Goes East to Re-
emit a New Company.
Barney Bernard, the clever He
brew comedian left last night for New
York, where he will organize a com
pany of players to present his new
play written by the well known local
dramatist. H. D. Cottrcll.
Bernard expects to complete his
l isk within six weeks, as he has tel
egraphed ahead for people and will
then return to the coast to make an
extended tour before giving himself
a Broadway airi'iS- The play is said
to be an exceptionally clever < o/nedy,
into which is interspersed a few som
ber shadings. The leading role of the
financier is one that is said to fit Ber
nard like a glove. In the production
