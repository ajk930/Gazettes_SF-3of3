ROSA TORTURICI IS OVERCOME BY HORROR
WIFE OF VILARDO'S SUPPOSED MURDERER UNABLE TO VIEW BODY
jy^RS. ROSA TORTURICI, wife of the man charged with the murder of Biaggio Vilardo, shrieked with fright yesterday when taken
into the room where lay the murdered mans remains, and refused to cast her eyes upon them. The officers, in pity, led her
from the place. In the office of Captain Burnett the bloody blanket and shawl in which the dismembered trunk had been wrapped
were suddenly unrolled before her, and she again cried out in fright and covered her eyes It was hoped a sight of the remains or
bloodstained relics might lead her to confess her husband's part in the murder. The murderer is still at large

Department could not bear to carry It
out to the stern, relentless end.
There is an old Sicilian superstition
that if any one connected with a mur
der touches the corpse blood will gush
from the wounds.
They told Mre. Torturici that she
must view the hacked remains of Vil
ardo. She was fondling her pretty
baby and crooning* to it a little Sicilian
lullaby. When she heard of the ordeal
she was to go through her face was
wild with terror.
The baby smiled- and leaned Its little
head upon a tiny hand. It's smiling,
contented features were in strong con
trast to the fear-distorted woman's
face above it.

"You must come and see the body."

"Tor Dio! For God's sake, no!"

In vain she pleaded. The ordeal was
decreed and she must go to gaze on the

"You had better leave your haby with

the Sicilian woman hugged the child
to her breast with the fierce tender
ness of a feline mother.
"No, I keep my baby," Â«he Insisted. !
Sho recovered from the shock rather
quickly and resumed her attitude of 1

new emotion of fear had driven tem

face. She was ready for the ordeal,

Looking from right to left with the
expression of a hunted animal, she j
walked between two detectives to the
Morgue. The baby cooed gleefully ac

mother upon the cheek.
The woman's head sank and she i

WASHINGTON, April 10. â The new
Pension Commissioner. Vespasian
Warner, has caused great consterna

should not be dismissed or reduced In
rank. The Commissioner is under
stood to be campaigning against what
he considers the slipshod methods in
his department. The offense for which
Â«nembers of the board are to answer
is allowing pensions to members of a
regiment that was never in the ser

. SACRAMENTO, April 10.â A letter j
from J. H. S.trlne..the recently deposed :
secretaryof the State text book com- i
mittee, to the various members of the!
Board of Education, made i public to- j
night,' contains not only reasons why ;
he believes himself unjustly treated by j
the members of the State text book j
committee, but j also â¢â  advances causes
which he believes led to the action. '
Among other things, ex-Secretary j
Strine states that what he terms the
manifest favoritism shown to a certain I
large book concern by Superintendent
of Instruction Kirk '. was the 'hiatus
from which the State Superintendent
gathered' strength for urging the sec
retary's dismissal.
The letter states that on the last day
of March the secretaryship of the
: State text book committee was sud
: denly, without warning from the com
mittee, without even a hearing on the '
! part of its secretary, declared vacant,
contrary to the promise made when he
was given the place two years ago, |
that he would always be given a hear
ing should anything of an unpleasant
nature arise at any time b?tween
Strine and the different members of
the committee. â  ** :
In his letter Strine states that on nu
merous occasions Superintendent Kirk
has shown displeasure - when , school
books other than those of a certain
firm have been recommended by ' the
former or by different appointed â¢ read
, ers and has not . hesitated to vent his
displeasure in unmistakable terms.

code providing for a jury of six men
to be unconstitutional. The opinion
was by Justice White and was based
on the ground that Alaska is a part
of the territory of the United States
m thp full sense of the word.
The question at issue in the case was
v hethÂ«>r Congress had the power under
the plxth amendment to the constitu
tion to deny one accused in Alaska of a
misdemeanor the right of trial by a
common law jury of twelve, and the
court decided that it had not such a
right. The court said the contention
that Alaska was not incorporated into
and a part of the United States was
devoid of merit.

TOGO LURES RUSSIAN
WARSHIPS NORTHWARD
Japanese Admiral Will Select His
Own Battleground Before
Making Attack.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
TOKIO. April 10.â It is believed here
hat if Admiral Rojestvensky steams j
northward In the direction of Vladi- j
/ostok, Togo probably will allow him |
;o proceed some distance with no fur
ther molestation than an occasional
torpedo attack and give battle off
Pescadores. That would be an ideal
fighting ground for the Japanese in
asmuch ap they have a naval base In
the islands.
On the other hand it is thought ex
tremely likely that the Russians will
ittempt to seize a temporary base .â 
somewhere in the southern Pacific, In
io-Chlna, or Dutch islands.
A leading Japanese paper likens the ,
Russians to insects flying into a fire, j
ST. PETERSBURG. April 11. 2:47 a. \
m.â Russia's information regarding ,
Rojestvensky s fie<*t, its location, dcs- !
Llnatlon and intentions is based solely I
in foreign telegrams, which are all tuo â 
meager to prevent a quickly ripening j
crop of rumors, according to one of j
which the adverse fleets have already j
Joined battle. Others of these dis
patches are attempting to locate vari- |
ously the battleship division of the
squadron. The Admiralty steadfastly
professes its inability to impart any j
light or clarify the situation, and there â¢
is reason to believe the profession ia j
made in good faith, at least as applies
to all except the very highest officials. 1
The Admiralty announced to-day !
that the report received yesterday was j
not from the commander of the squad
ron, but from the captain of a mer
chant ship, who had encountered the
fi^et and reported to the Russian Con
sulate at Singapore.
Some naval officers conjecture that |
the four battleships fell behind in order
to effect a junction with Vice Admiral
Nebogatoff's division, but generally
credence is given H> the report that the
battleships are taking a southern route
through Sunda Straits, the selection of
the Singapore route being regarded as
in the nature of a feint and to min
imize the danger of a tovpedo-boat at
tack on the mainstays of the fleet.

VICTORIA. B. C. April 10. â The
steamer Anthenian, which arrived to- !
day from Yokohama, brought the j
crews of the steamships Venus, Aph- |
rodite, Vign and M<*jxÂ»pdes, blockade
runners seized by the Japanese near ''
Tsugaru Straits while trying to reach i
Vladivostok with coal from Cardiff, j
The seamen report the death of two i
men of the crew of the Mara, also |
seized at Tsugaru Straits. Her crew j
of thirty-nine left the vessel, which
was caught in the ice. and two were j
frozen to death, being lost on the j
shores of Hokkaido. Their compan- j
ions, who were searching for them,
discovered their bodies on the sea
shore.
Captain T. H. Schwaner, a success
ful blockade runner, was another pas
senger. He ran the blockade to Vladi

The imminence- of a naval battle j

Newcastle. Colorado, Plans a
Novel Greeting for the
President and His Party
BRUIN TO START HUNT
He Will Be Giren an Hour's
(#aee and Then the Chase
Will Begin in Earnest
NEWCASTLE. Colo., April 10.â The
big pack train and camp outfit for
President. Roosevelt's party received
hurry-up orders to move to-day and
Guides "Jake" Borah and John Gofl
headed the procession of nearly
horses and sixty dogs for the Johnson
ranch, about twenty miles south of
Newcastle, where camp will be pitched
for a week or ten days. As soon as the
camp is well established the extra men,
as well as several ranchmen and trap
pers who will be engaged, will scour
the country in search of bear tracks.
Tney will carefully note all the signs
and general locations so that when
the President starts out there will be
no delay in looking for tracks.
Citizens of Newcastle are planning a
novel reception for the President next
Saturday morning, which will be sub
ject to hi 3 approval. It la proposed
that a grand parade be held, in which
Piesid^nt Roosevelt shall ride so he
can be seen by the citizens. At the
head of the procession will be a mon
ster brown bear in a cage. The animal
was recently captured and he is now
at the residence of Frank Hilliajrd,
where he has succeeded in killing at
least a dosen dogs and injuring several
men who ventured too near him.
Goff and Borah will put their pack
of hounds in a corral and the bear will
be given an hour's start for the hill*.
Then the packs will be set on the trail
and President Rooaerelt. Dr. Lambert,
Philip B. Stewart and the guides will
follow in hot pursuit. This is. planned
to be the official start of the hunt.
OKLAHOMA CITY, O. T.. April 10.â
The President and his party began
their hunt this morning after experi
encing the Western rainstorm during
the night. A special from Frederick,
O. T., says:
The wolf chase to which t%e Presi
dent has been so eagerly looking fir
ward began eariy this morning at
Camp Roosevelt, eighteen miles south
east of here.
The party of about a doien. including
President Roosevelt, had not traveled
far this morning when their dogs turn
ed on a fresh scent. Soon the hunter*
were rewarded by seeing in a neighbor
ing ravine a lank gray wolf, loping as
if unmindful of its pursuers. The dotes
all seemed to catch sight of the prey
at the same time and shot forward
with renewed energy. The wolf en
deavored to elud* Its pursuers by
dodging, but this pnly hurried matters,
as it enabled the foremost dogs to catch
up with their prey. As the wolf tumM
to beat off its assailants other doj?s
sprang upon the bristling animal and
bore it to the ground. wh<>re It wa*
quickly dispatched without thp aid of
the hunters.
Two oth<Â»r trairca were killed . in
much the same manner before the al
most direct rays of the sun indi^ar^l
that it was about time for the midday
meal.
The President was invariably at the
head of the s procession of riders. At
one point, seeing some water; in a buf
falo wallow, he galloped to the spot be
fore the dogs reached" It and sipped the
refreshing liquid in good old fashion in
the cowboy style. Only about ten of
the party took part . in . the . afternoon's
sport, as it was found. that the greater
the number, of hunters the smaller the
amount of sport. ( Horses, riders and
dogs seemed to grow in endurance as
the day waned, and by night the big
reservation contained a "considerably
less .number of coyotes than it did when
the chase began. â  'Â ' ' '- .
RANCHERS FISH
FOR COYOTES
Social Dispatch to The Call.
SANTA FE. N. M.. April 10.âRanch
men in this county have discovered a
scheme for getting rid of coyotes,
which have been a source of almost
endless trouble. Large fishhooks are
being tied to bushes, being placed some
distance from the ground in order to
force the animals to jump for the mea*
thereon. When the Jaws of the coyotes
close upon the supposed food they are
immediately caught by the hook and
are held suspended until killed.
?he plan is reported to bÂ« working
extremely well and ranchmen who have
been losing chickens and lambs in
large numbers are pleased with the re
sults.

BUT DETECTIVES ARE UNTIRING
Mrs.Torturici Ter
ror Stricken at
Morgue.
Shrieks When the
Bloody Relics
Are Shown.
Continued From Page 1, Column S.
But the tread ol the detectives rang
en thÂ« pavement with the ominous mo
notony of a firing squad leading a pris
cner u> his death. She lifted her head,
and the defiant scowl was there again.
Up the stairs of the Morgae she
waJktd to the threshold of the room
where tte inutLated body lay. They
halted her there and told her the baby
must not be carried in.
They took the little thing from her.
The baby cooed and patted the face of
the policeman that held it. The moth
er's knees shook and her (ace was
deathlike.
OFFICERS ARK LWERVED.
Suddenly they flung back the door. In
the ghastly light oi the autopsy room
a sheeted form looked up, white and
terrifying.
A woman's shriek, that caused the
most hardened to blanch, roiiowed.
"Por Dio!" she cried. "For Ccfls sake,
no:"
With prayers and shrieks blended in
one desperate outburst, she fought and
struggled. They could not drag her
near that sheeted horror. She turned
her head from it and massed all her
little strength frantically to force her
ay from the scene.
Those who . insisted and still insist
that the woman was present when
Blaggio Vilardo was hacked to pieces
in the little house on Green street
could not bear it. Men who had seen
death in ugly shapes and never shud
dered quailed before the woman's des
perate cry, "For God's sake, no:"
So they took her back to the room of
the captain of detectives and ques
tioned her again. She rained in a short
time. With the baby on her knee she
answered the questions put to her with
the air of a sullen defiance she had car
ried since her arrest, excepc when led
to Vilardo's marble bed.
They went over her account of the
night when Biagslo Vilardo was
hicked to pieces a few feet from her
bedroom. They got very little out of
herâ jast one little detail, which does
not amount to much as evidence.
This is the little additional point she
libers; . When Pietro Torturici
came into the room where his wife and
>iihy lay after the brutal murder had
been committed, he kissed the baby.
It was believed that the woman
wculd break down and confess when
she was forced to look upon the muti
lated corpse, but if she knows anything
rcore than she has told the officers
could not wrench It from her yester
day. The play upon the Sicilian super
stition was uneffectual. if the woman
had anything to confess, for they could
not carry it out to the bitter end. They
feared that the woman would lose her
reason. Ceaselessly the detectives plied
hsr with questions, but she reiterated
nÂ«r previous stories. Her manner was
as flogged and sullen as ever.
BIXXJDY BLANKET UXROIiIiED.
Suddenly a bundle was brought into
i*v room and flung upon the floor be
side the woman. It was opened, and a
fcrigrht red blanket unrolled. The baby
en her knee saw the brilliant color and
stretched out Its tiny hand toward It.
The mother's air of defiance "was gone
In an Instant and her face was again
distorted with terror. A detective lift
ed the blood-soaked shawl that had
onveloped the hacked trunk found on
Russian Hill.
"Per Dio:" she shrieked again, and

A GREAT TROTH.
How I! Ess Spread Frcm Home to Home
in San Francisco.
In every part of San Francisco, in
the homes of the wealthy, in the
humble abode of the man of toil, 'tis
now a well-known fact â a great truth
âthat Doan's Kidney Pills have
brought more comfort to backache
sufferers and cured more sick kidneys
than any medicine of modern time.
John Lewis, tailor, rear of 721 Bush
street, says: "An attack of malaria,
as in a majority of instances, was fol-
lowed by inactivity of the kidneys
and a lameness and soreness across
the small of my back. Sitting as I
am compelled to do, particularly
stooped, strained the muscles of the
loins, and aching ensued, and when I
straightened I could only -describe
the , twinges which shot through the
small of my back as excruciating,
With the passing of time the pain
increased until I was compelled to
stop work. I knew something had to
be done or my case might become
serious, and I commenced taking
standard remedies guaranteed to cure
kidney complaint in any of its va-
rious forms. The results obtained ;
from the medicines ceased the mo-
ment I stopped their use. and, ever on
the outlook for something to bring
relief, I at last tried Doan's Kidney
Pills. I knew after a dose or two
they were acting directly upon the kid-
neys, and a continuation of the treat-
ment absolutely stopped the last at-
tack. I have toid a great many of
my friends and acquaintances about
the benefit I have received from the
use of Doan's Kidney Pills."

begged them In the name of all the
saints to take the ghastly things away.
While she was stil! stiaKing with the
outburst of terror the detectives plied
her afresh with questions.
They wanted to learn of the plot be
hind the butchery and whether she
knew where her husband was lurking.
They learned nothing.
The woman is the daughter of a race
that can keep secrets. "The Mafia has
never been betrayed," they say in the
Latin quarter. If this woman knows
what she is believed to know the soul
in that slender body of hers is steeled.
She is scarcely more than a girl in
years, but she has gone through some
terrible ordeals in the last few days.
She has seen a man who was infatuat
ed with her hacked to pieces, so Cap
tain Burnett thinks; she has been in
quisitloned by stern-faced, almost
merciless men, and been locked in a
cell to brood over the horrors she has
seen.
No wonder she clings to the baby.
Deserted by her husband, hounded and
watched day and night, the little mite
of humanity is the only thing that
links her to life.
Captain Burnett was asked if he
were going to take the baby from her.
"No," he declared emphatically, "I
haven't the heart to do it."
The woman is closely watched by the
prison matron. The police are guard-

laughing after him, joking him about
a dollar that Torturici owed him. In
reply to Cuneo's question, 'When are
you going to come through with that
dollar, Pete?' Torturici hung his head
in a sullen manner. He refused to
answer our salutations. I know him
as well as I know my own mother
and cannot possibly be mistaken."
Cuneo and Bacigalupl are the last
persons who saw Torturici who have
come forward with a statement to the
police.

Ing: against any attempt that she may
make at suicide.
HUSBAND DENOUNCED.
The visit to the Morgue was made at
the suggestion of District Attorney By
iugton. The belief was that when the
woman saw the mangled remains she
would break down and tell all she knew
if she did know anything. Detectives
Ed Gibson and McMahon, Captain Bur
nett and Chief Dinan accompanied her.
Louis Ferrari, from the District Attor
ney's office, went along to interpret.
The trao was laid perfectly, but they
could not break the little woman down.
A representative from L' ltalia, Carlos
Delpino, was in the Morgue when this
inquisition was tried. He covered his
ears when the woman's shriek rang
out. Delpino waa highly indignant over
this method at sweating and said it
would rouse the indignation of the Lat
in quarter. "If that woman was used
as a decoy and was an accomplice she
is a wonderful actor." he announced.
Delpino said that Mrs. Rosa Torturici
came from an Italian family of the bet
ter class. Her people had suffered sud
den reverses, and when she met Tortu
rici at New Orleans she was on the
verge of abject poverty.
L'ltalia to-day will have a scathing
editorial denouncing Torturici as an
abject coward to leave the woman and
child in such a predicament.

ble with horror, to commit perJury and
seek the protection of the police? What
was the dread power that Impelled
probably 1000 Italians who knew him
to slowly file through the exposure
room of the Morgne, view the mutilat
ed corpse of Biagglo Vllardo and de
part with but one to tell the name they
all knew so well? Italians who knew
him In life, knew him in death.
The story printed in yesterday morn
ing's Call was based on evidence. The
Mafia did meet in a shack at North
Beach four weeks before the murder
and decided upo Torturici as the man
â¢who was to do the killing. The same
organization hired the house at 736% A
Green street and planned the detail of
the atrocious murder. Biaggio Vilardo
was killed because he was Brogardo's
friend.
Torturici, better known as "Peter the
Torch," was well known in the North
Beach section. He was constantly seen
around the grocery kept by Eu
gene A. Malatesta at Montgomery av
enue and Green street. Only two
weeks before the murder- he was hired
to wash windows. Policeman Jack
Evatt, who is one of the strongest fac
tors in this manhunt, knew Torturici
well.
WITNESSES ARE AFRAID.
The Mafia, hying planned and ac
complished the execution 1b now pro
tecting Torturici. The murderer had
little money when he disappeared. If
he wished to leave town money would
be supplied him. The strongest theory
and the one which meets most favor
with those v%rsed in the workings of
the Mafia is that the man wanted has
not left town, but is hiding in some
fcart of the thickly populated Latin
quarter.
The Mafia is a secret organization,
Captain Burnett is still certain that
the woman used her attraction's to de
coy the unfortunate Vilardo to the
slaughter pen. He believes firmly that
when the cleaver sunk into her ad
mirer's skull she was standing close
by. He has testimony that she helped
to clear away the ghastly evidence of
the crime. She bought the kalsomine â
he knows that. He thinks that when
the gray light of dawn crept into the
room where the butchery was done she
was on her knees scrubbing at the pool
of blood that could not be blotted from
the floor. Her slender hands tried hard
to cover the blood spatters on the wall.
These are some of the confessions he
tried to force from the apparently
weak little woman. Not one admis
sion could he secure. She did not wit
ness the murder â she declared sullenly.
The tiny shred of flesh that had
been found on her apron waa shown
to her. She turned her head quickly
from it. "I do not know how it came
there," she insisted.
"Vilardo did not care for me," she
said. "If he did and my husband
knew about it I would be the one who
would be dead. That is the way of the
people of Sicily.
"I. do not know why my husband
should have killed him unless it was
because they quarreled. I am sure
that they did not fight about me. I
do not know where my husband IS
organized for the sole purpose of mur
dering and plundering. It is of Sicilian
origin and flourishes to-day most pow
erfully near Palermo, Sicily, that isl
and of vendettas and murder. There
persons are held for ransom, if the
captive's friends or relatives do not
pay the ransom the victim's body is
cut in several pieces and sent to his
family. In Italy the same organiza
tion is known as Camorra. The Mafia
has been fought in New York and New
Orleans, where its members have com
mitted some of the most fiendish mur
ders in the history of the country, in
the latter city the police by weli or
ganized plans succeeded in breaking it
up to a certain extent, but every now
and then another victim Is found cut
to pieces. The mutilation of the corpse
after death Is one of the signs of thÂ«Â»
work of the Mafia.
The police have been obstructed in
the work of clearing this latest mur
der mystery by the taciturn air of the
Italians approached. Low caste
Italians and even some of high birth
have refused to divulge information
refused to be mixed in the case and
those who have covertly aided the po
lice beg and plead that their names
be not mentioned. Italians of high
birth have feared to interpret for the
newspapers and police, because they
say, they do not wish a knife thrust
into their backs as they seek their
homes in the darkness of the night
This is no ordinary fear.
The evidence of the Mafia in New
Orleans first came to light from a
series of horrible murders that showed
a cunning and careful planning of
execution. The existence of a secret
society was evident. Through per
sistent work the New Orleans police
exposed the Mafia and drove its mem
bers from the city, with a warning
never to return.

WANT TO USE
NAVY HOSPITAL
Special Dispatch to The Call.
VALLEJO, April 10.â The Vallejo
Trades and Labor Council has adopted
resolutions which have been forwarded
to the Secretary of the Navy, asking
that the employes of the Mare Island
navy yard be allowed the use of the
Naval Hospital on Mare Island. At
the present time there are 1900 men em
ployed at the big Government plant
and if an accident occurs the only
method of treatment Is the temporary
relief afforded at the yard dispensary,
which is at present overcrowded.
The Government maintains a large
hospital on the navy yard for the treat
ment of the enlisted men of the navy,
but the accommodations for the yard
employes are not at all adequate.

RAN JOSE, April 10. â Pietro Tortu

San Francisco, was employed here for
a time eighteen months ago on the
construction of the San Jose-Los
Gatos Interurban Electric Railway.
This, it was believed, was before he
went to San Francisco, as he had just
come from New Orleans. He worked
with a :>lck and shovel and those who
met him found him a very quiet
fellow.
It is believed that after the murder
Torturici came back here and bought
a ticket for Kansas City. A man an

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, APRIL 11, l!>05.
W. R. WHEELER ADDRESSES STUDENTS
ON PRESIDENT'S RAILROAD POLICY
Reviews Historu
of Legislation
to Date.
Saijs Regulation
of Rates Is
Needed.
Before the students of the college of
commerce of the University of Califor
nia yesterday afternoon at Berkeley W.
R. Wheeler, from the point of view of a
business man, reviewed President
Roosevelt's railroad policy. He began
by saying that he made no claim to be
ing a student of economics, but he ap
peared as a "plain, every-day business
man. whose walk in life has fOT some
yeafs past thrown him into more or less
intimate contact with railroad traffic
managers and rate-making questions
affecting directly Pacific Coast inter
ests."
Mr. Wheeler went over the history of
the various steps that preceded the
creation of the Interstate Commerce
Commission. He also spoke of legisla
tion, and said that ever since the
United States Supreme Court some
eight years ago decided that the com
mission had not the power to fix rates,
in each successive Congress bills have
been introduced aiming to give the
commission power to fix corrective
rates. He said:
. The â  Influence â of the railroad* . has, . ho wÂ«vÂ«r,
been to great that these efforts have not met
with success and only such amendments were
passed as save to the railroad* Increased ben
efits anil protection. .1 do not mean to Imply
that such amendments were | not also rood for
thÂ« public, but the -direct results were, in far
greater degree, , beneficial to the railroad*. The
public - sentiment, as - expressed >â . through i thÂ«
iast House of Representatives, in Its vote on
the â  Bsch-Townsend bill â 826 . for and 6nly 17
againstâ thÂ« prophecy - that another
Congress \*ill â  not - adjourn without ' adopting
remedial measures. ;: â  . 'â  :â â 'â â -â â '
LÂ«et uÂ« hop* that the io-called conÂ«Â«rvatlve
branch of Congress, whose conservatism Is In
spired by members holding at one and the
same time the office of United States Senator
and that of president or attorney of a great
railroad corporation, â will remember that their
first obligation is to the people and at thÂ»
next session lay aside all railroad obligation*
and co-operate with the lower house In prompt
ly passing a bill in line with the President's
recommendations.
EFFECT OF THE LAW.
Mr. Wheeled having exhaustively re
viewed the history of the making of
the existing interstate commerce law,
concerning the effects of the law he
said in part:
The people of the United States expected
when the interstate commerce law was passed
that henceforth interstate commerce by rail
road would move under rates reasonable and
Just to all shippers and consignees and to all
localities, or that the rates would be sum
marily regulated by the Interstate Commerce
Commission under the powers granted by that
act. They declared in that statute agalnn
wrongful preference and exactions of every
nature, name and kind, and when any such
should be discovered the commission was re
quired to order the carrier making them .to
cease and desist from the Illegal charge or
practice.
The people believed that . authorizing the
commission to forbid an unlawful charge car
ried with It the power to forbid the whole of
euch charge, and to compel the carrier to
"ccaÂ»e and desist" enHrely from charging
any other rate than such as' It might fiftd
would be lawful. The commieston acted upon
that btllef for ten years, and until the ques
tion was raised In the courts the carrier*
themselves acted upon that belief.
Xow thin was til wrong. The Supreme
Court of the United States said in 1897 that
the commission may condemn a rate it flnd.Â«
to be unreasonable, but It cannot order the
carrier to "cease and desist" from charging
come other unreasonable rate, or to cease and
demist from charging more than the rate found
In the came case to be reasonable. The rate
on lumber from Snn Francisco to Phoenix may
be unreasonable, and in a cane brought to test
the question the commission may find H
so. but if X does It can only forbid that par
ticular rate. The carrier is at liberty to make
only the slightest reduction and claim It ha*
â¢atitfW the law. The complaining shipper
must k< ep on complaining and litigating, arid
the commission must keep on hearing the case
and issuing order*, until at last a reasonable
rate shall be secured. This is the law as
paÂ«sed by Congress in 1887 and defined by the
Supreme Court of the United States ten years
later.
But this is not all. Then the commission
Issues an - order. That order need : not :be
obeyed by the carrier until the t courts compel
It to do no. " Application to enforce the order
must be mode to the: Circuit Court 'of thÂ»
United States and either, party may ; appeal
from the decision of that court to" the Circuit
Court â¢of Appeals and again to the Supreme
Court. These Cases have avpfared - about four
years in the ~ courts before final - decision â  ha?
beett' rendered. ; Â"'â¢'. â '.", >'â¢ U'^'i "/:â ., â -â  \':}i'V
FAVORS RECOMMENDATIONS. /
Declaring that the great issue is that
interstate railway, rates shall not only
be reasonable in themselves, but rela
tively reasonable .and just as compared
with rates allowed to other persons and
pttret, ar.d that all unreasonable of
unjust charges shall be subject upon
mmplftint to summary regulation by
ihe Interstate Commerce Commission,
Mr. Wheeler recapitulated the various
condition* that called for remedy and
reviewed the recommendations made by
President Roosevelt. He also ridiculed
the claim that "the making of a rail
way rate requires a peculiar mental
quality, and that this quality is pos
sessed only ny an" occasional specimen
of a human being, and, that the entire
supply has already been used up by the
railways at extremely high figures,
hence the Government could not, if it
would, and would .not If it could, pro*
cure that form of genius which is
necessary to make or revise a rate
schedule."
He argued that the railway opposi
tion to the recommendations of Presl
dÂ«nt Roosevelt was a mistake, and
said:
"If their opposition shaJ! succeed In
defeating remedial legislation during
the next Beseion of Congress, how long
will it be before other and more drastic
measures will be presented, supported
by a resistless tide of public opinion?
If a bill on the lines of President
Roosevelt's recommendation is passed
the work of regulation will take on new
life.'
Mr. Bird of the Gould lines; Mr. In
galls. president of a large railway sys
tem: Mr. Nlmmo, Chauncey M. Depew
and Mr. Roberts, the lat* president of
the Pennsylvania Railroad, Were quoted
as flaying that railway regulation had
come to stay. Commissioner Prouty
stated before the Interstate Commerce
Commission one year ago that five sys
tems, or five different person*, now con
trol 117,500 miles of railroad. He said;
As soon as the Santa Fe/Hhe Rock Island and
the | St. . Paul \ pass , into ; the hands of one or the
other, of i these! (gentlemen i they will : control ! the
entire railway situation, the remaining
$00,000 miles of road are simply feeders, having

Chicago Employers' Associa

Sympathetic Interference
CHICAGO, April to.â There was noth
ing In to-days developments that
would indicate that there will be *
peaceable settlement of the strike bÂ»
gun by the teamsters against the mail
order house of Montgomery. Ward A Cn.
Wagons and vans of the big store
manned by non-union men made sev
eral turbulent trips to-day delivering
goods to railroad freight- ho uses
though big and noisy crowds followed
the caravans and the police were forced
to break a number of blockades, deliv
eries to the railroads were declared by
the officials of the store to have been a
great deal more successful than last
week's efforts.
Forty member* of the Employers'
Association issued a statement to-day
to the teamsters to put a stop to the
sympathetic movement. They declare
that under no conditions will they al
low the teamsters to interfere with the
carrying on of les^timate business,
which would be the case If the strike
were extended to other concerns In or

orchestra, basing, clothing, rounding
out the rest. Mr. Vlgna took the num
ber a little mere slowly than usual,
adding thereby a desirable dignity.
The house rose to it, of course; shout
ed, stamped, clapped its gloved and
ungloved palms into a lively vermilion,
until the leader threw up his hands
and repeated it.
Better than Sembrich has sung here
since her Violetta in that startlirtg
"Traviata" of three years ago she sang
last night with everything that she has
and is. She sang Lucia to Tetrazzinl
five feet away from her over the or
chestra. It was a challenge and a tri
umph. One wished at times that Tet
razzini would toss over a top note to
the diva. Hers, alas, have undeniably
lost their dazzle and purity. And say
what you will about the top note fever,
the top note is needed or it would not
be there. One hankers after it for cli
max, for the high light, for the full
lyric satisfaction, and without it one
goes hungry.
As to the rest â Bembrich's voice, it
is still the loveliest of the day, peerless
in quality, liquid, velvet, bell-like.
There is no art like Sembrich's. It was
at its molt precious in the mad scene,
with all the twinkling turns and trills
fitted subtly into the dramatic situa
tion. Most appealing was Sembrich
here on the dramatic side, charming in
her madness as in Ophelia. Of course
this was where the house came down,
but the aria was not repeated.
Then Caruso. One had been told to
waR for Caruso's Edgardo. Anything
Caruso does is handsomely "worth wait
ing for, of course, but to mention his
EJdgardo in the same day with his
Panio is not essential. I'm sure he
thinks so himself, for he was not par
ticularly happy in the part. It is so
difficult to humorize Edgardo. Only in
the marriage scene did the singer at
tempt It. It is much better fun, too,
seeing Caruao kill other folk. He kills
himself as though he had convictions
on the suicide question, and quite with
out enjoyment.
Sing? Of course, though Caruso sang
last night not so well as either in
"Rigoletto" or "Pagliacci." They gave
the last act â as we always do here â
for the purpose of allowing us to hear
the tenor flights in the scene. In New
York, without Caruso, they cut the act.
But It was one of the priceless mo
ments of the opera last night. One
simply sat back and gloated. It is
the apex of song, sovereign, triumph
ant. Oh, but, too, the exquisite con
certed bits between the soprano and
t*norl The art of ensemble can go no
further. The blend of the voices and
souls was absolute in its perfection.
Mr. Parrls, who made so brave a
showing as Mr. Scotti's substitute as
Rigoletto, showed again notable intel
ligence and -ocal accomplishment as
Henry Ashton. Then Mr. Journet was
the Ralmondo, and a distinctive one.
One hap heard the "Infelice" more
sympathetically sung, but otherwise
Mr. Journet proved himself a most
useful member of the cast. Mr. Reiss,
with one plaid stocking up and the
other plaid stocking down, sang just
as If he hadn't. An accomplished little
tenor this, and with the same con
science and aplomb in small roles as
the ever-useful Cortesi, with a fine
voice and technique to boot. Mr. Giac
cone's Arturo furnished an excellent
excuse for Lucia's madness. He looked
like a chocolate cream man and sang
that way.'
The chorus and orchestra were de
lightful throughout, contributing to a
performance that in its .entirety will

BIG RUSH FOR SEATS.
Unprecedented Sale Yestefday for
Closing Performances of Season.
While the advance sale of seats for I
Conried opera season was great, j
and the Bale of tickets on the opening
day was immense, it was Â«mall as
compared with the tremendous de
mand at the box office yesterday.
From 9 o'clock yesterday morning
until 10 o'clock last night a long line
of ticket buyers stood in line. There
, seemed to be no especial performance
in preference. Seats for every per
formance were in demand.
The Caruso nights, perhaps were
| in favor, as this great artist is new !
to the coaaL Seats for the other nights !
with operas %\ hich have been rarely
sung here, and which are to be pre
sented by such a brilliant array of i
artists were also rapidly bought up
Charles W. Strine, the business
manager for Mr. Conried, said last
night: "This sale of seats is entirely
unprecedented. We took in more
money yesterday than we did on the
opening day of the sale. The sale
so far has beaten all previous records
in the grand opera line. If we do not
take in another cent, the financial
success of this great undertaking is
assured. We are more than satisfied '
and pleased at the way the public has i
come forward. This is, of course, due
!to the superb organization that we
have brought out here. It is the great- I
est aggregation of talent in the grand I
I opera line now before the public,
either in this country or Europe. No
such an array of great- artists has ever
I been brought here before. Think of |
; it. we have Caruso, the acknowledged |
I greatest tenor of the world; Xordtca '
; and Sembrich, who stand peerless in I
! their line, and to-day we introduce a '
1 new artist. Miss Olive Fremstad. She i
; will appear as Kundry in 'Parsifal '
â¢ Her performance in New York in this
role created a veritable sensation. Her
I conception of the character is unlike
; that of any other great artist who has
j essayed it. She will undoubtedly ere-
I ate a tremendous furor. The per
i formance of 'Die Meistersinger.' which I
will be given at the Saturday matinee,
will be one of the big events of the
season. It will be given with identi- i
cally the same cast as it was given in '

unanimously said that it was the ideal I

BIG FREIGHT REDUCTION

Chicago and Eastern to Eliminate the
Bridge Toll of Five Dollars
a Car.
CHICAGO, April 10. â One of the
most startling moves made by West-
I crn railroads In freight traffic for a
i long time was made by the Chicago
i and Eastern Illinois to-day, when it
was announced that that line would
absorb the terminal, charges across
the bridge at St. Loufe on all freight
carried over Its* road. This charge,
amounting to 15 per car, has hitherto
ben added to the freight charges to
East St. Louis. By the new plans
the freight charge to East St. Louis
will take the freight acroÃs the bridge
without the toll to the bridge com
pany. The result Is a direct reduction
in rates of $6 per car.

charges be proven. Rockefeller may be
expelled from the Fifth-avenue Baptist
Church.
It is the duty of the church, of its
own motion, to put on trial any mem
bers who have been accused publicly
of misdeeds of any character. The
same obligation that rests upon the
church as a whole rests upon each
member of the church as an individ
ual.
This being the <case, exponents of
Baptist doctrine declare the members
of the Fifth-avenue church will not be
faithful to church law if they do not
invite proceedings against Rockefeller
at once. Aside from this it is the im
perative duty of Rockefeller, according
to the laws of thÂ« Baptist church, to
demand an investigation.
BOSTON, April 10.â A gift of $200,000
from John D. Rockefeller to the Amer
ican Baptist Missionary Cnion was
announced to-day by Treasurer C. W.
Perkins at a meeting of the executive
committee.
One-half of the amount was received
last Friday and the receipt of the do
nation was made public at that time.
At the meeting to-day Treasurer Per
kins said that an additional $100,000
from the same source was at its dis
posal, to be used exclusively for the
construction of mission buildings In
foreign countries. This money has not
yet been received, but will be available
whenever the work requires it. Neither
gift, the treasurer declared, was vol
untary, but had been solicited by the
officers of the union in order to raise
funds to meet the growing needs of
the work in which tite union was en
gaged. Perkins made the following
statement after the meeting:
No act! n Is erer taken In regard to the ac
ceptance of gifts, and the usual course has
been adopted In this Instance. No one sug
gested that the gift ought not to be accepted.
Every onÂ« seems grateful for such a generous
contribution. It Is not llkeiy that the money
for building purposes will oe cal.ed for Imme
diately. We shall ask for It as wÂ« need It.
The committee representing # the Con
gregational clergymen who have pro
tested against the acceptance by the
American Board of Commissioners for
Foreign Missions of a gift of $100,000
from Rockefeller made public to-night
a mass of correspondence from all sec
tions of the country. Among the writ
ers are Professor Hugh N. Scott, Chi
cago Theological Seminary; Rev. H.
Thayer, home missionary superintend
ent for Kansas, and Rev. J. C. Arm
strong, superintendent of the Chicago
Missionary Society.
Professor Scott says he believes, the
Lord does not yet want "robbery for
burnt offerings" or "the price of a dog"
to enter his treasury.
Superintendent Armstrong says the
money Is unclean and the church
knows it, and adds:
We do know that for a shameless) disregard
of the rights of our fellow men the Standard
Oil Company stands out as the most conscience
less, brazen and dangerous corporation this
country has ever produced.

the property to be offered to the State
commission that will select the site.
This will be done so that prices can
not be raised during the negotiations

be named.
Resolutions were adopted calling
the attention of the State commission
to the fact that Haywardf? offers the
nearest site to the State University, the
greatÂ«Bt variety of products and the
most even climate of any section of
the State.
Four tracts of 320 acres each were
c>fr*red to the local committee and
options will be given during the pres

SELECT SITE
FOR A CHURCH
OAKLAND, April 10. â Stf Paul's
Episcopal Church is to have a new
edifice, and the first step taken in this
direction haR been the decision of the
vestry upon the site at Boulevard Ter
race and Twenty-third street. Ac
cording to a statement made by Rev,
C. T.Walkley an option has been taken
on the premises and the purchase will
be perfected as soon as the action of
the vestry is ratified. The lot is
125x240 feet and will give room to
have considerable space about the
building, besides which it haa three of
its sides facing streets.
The building will be a stone struct
ure to cost at least $60,000 and may
go higher, the Idea being to build a
handsome edifice regardless of cost. It
is probable that an Eastern architect
who makes a specialty of churches
will do the Job, but he has not yet
been selected.

EXCITING TALE
Tells How He Was Grasped
by Throat and Imprisoned
by Frederick L. Mathes
ASKS FOR BIG DAMAGES
says the Defendant Became
Knrajred Over a Bill and
Abused Him Shamefully
Frederick L. Mathes, manager of
the Pacific Vinegar and Pickle Works,
has been made the defendant in a
suit for $6000 damages for false im
prisonment instituted against him by
G. J. Irwin, who is connected with
the St. John Hospital in Oakland.
Irwin gays that on March 3 he went
to Mathes' offices at 122 Davis street
and. in line with his business, pre
sented Mathes with a bill for services
rendered him at the St. John Hospital.
The size of the bill, though not un
reasonable, caused Mathes to fly into
a rage, says Irwin. and he, observing
that Mathes had lost his temper, de
cided it was best to leave the office.
Irwin started to go, he says, but
.-d thp bill from his
hands, tore it up and threw it on the
and then, his anger still unsati
Â«ted, grasped the plaintiff by the
ihroat and hurled him into a chair.
the plaintiff says, he
sougrht to escape, but each time
Mathes got a strangle hold on him
and put him back into the chair
without ceremony. For three hours
this kept up. Irwin says. Mathes at
â  ring of abufir.g him. called a
policeman and had him arrested on ji
chain orbing the peace.
This action was unwarranted, says
Irwin. and Judge Cabaniss so held
when the case came before him and
promptly ordered him discharged
from custody. For all of the wrongs
Irwin alleges Mathes has committed
against him he asks that the defend
ant be compelled to pay $5000 dam
ages and costs of suit.

proval of Postal Authorities.
The postal fraud order heretofore
issued by the Postmaster General
against the American Mutual Invest
ment Company, the American Mer
cantile Company and B. Warner Rice
was rescinded yesterday by order of
Postmaster General Cortelyou. The
companies named were operating in
this city and Los Angeles on the dia

time the first fraud order was issued
some months ago. Then representa
tives of the companies went to Wash
ington and upon their representation
that the diamond investment feature
would be eliminated and a coupon
bond scheme substituted the fraud or
der was rescinded. The companies
made the most of the rescision by ad
vertising that their scheme had the
approval ot the Postoffice Department
and business began pouring in faster
than ever. After a few weeks under
the new order, investors in Los An
geles complained to the postal author
ities that the new scheme was unsat
isfactory and another fraud order was
issued holding up the malls of the
companies named.
Postoffice Inspector O'Connell yes
terday, in reply to a question, said
that he did not know why the last
order had been rescinded. He ap
peared to be very much disgusted, but
declined to discuss the matter.

RUTH CRAIG'S ACQUITTAL
LEADS TO GREAT JOY.
OSCULATORY RAPTURE
HOLDS THE BOARDS
Woman Accused of Selling Liquor With
out License Rejoices' When Set Free,
JAMES C. CRAWFORD
No sooner was Miss Ruth Craig,
ochre-haired, wide-hatted and statu
esque of form, pronounced not guilty
of having sold liquor without license
than she was made the recipient of a
flattering congratulatory demonstra
tion. Women hastened to wag her
hands and gushingly assure her of the
pleasure conveyed to them by her ac
quittal, and some of the more enthu
siastic of them pecked daintily at her
cheeks in oscillatory rapture. When she
had run the feminine gauntlet several
members of the opposite sex continued
the ovation until a fragile looking little
man brought it to an abrupt finish by
donning his headgear in order to leave
both his hands free to embrace her
while he stood on tiptoe and protruded
his lips to meet hers.
"Take off your hat in court!" thun
dered an unsentimental bailiff.
"Do you know he's my husband?" In
quired Miss Craig, in tone more frigid
than liquid air.
"I don't care what he is," raspingly
chipped in Clerk "Barney" Conlan; "I
only wish he could be cinched for con
tempt."
His Honor Judge Cabaniss mildly
suggested that kissing could be per
formed in the corridor with less dan
ger of official interruption, and to the
corridor Miss Craig immediately re
tired, followed by her train of sympa
thizers, the rebuked little man in the
vanguard.
Miss Craig and Miss Blanche Stewart,
also of blonde coiffure and spacious
millinery, were arrested in their joint
home on the first block" of Taylor street
by Patrolmen Smith and Phillips mas
querading as ruralists in the city for a
"timo." The sleuths stated that they
ordered a bottle of beer, which was
brought to them by one Harry Smith,
who was also arrested and charged
with selling the beverage. Mr. Smith
pleaded that he merely acted as a mes
senger boy, and the women claimed
that they did not sell the beer, so all
three were discharged.
In explanation of the gladness catifced
by Miss Craig's dismissal it was stated
that those who congratulated her were
open to similar accusation and that her
acquittal was regarded by them as an
agreeable outcome of a test case.
â¢ â¢ â¢
By surreptitiously dropping tacks and
nails into molasses taffy in process of
"pulling" several naughty night school
pupils conveyed great annoyance to
young lady clerks In the candy store of
A. H. Wiggins, 1049 Market street, and
when Mr. Wiggins captured one of the
youths and transferred him to the cus
tody of Patrolman W. P. Monahan an
adult of the name of W. C. Lowrye
pronounced the arrest a shame and at
tempted a rescue by force, In which
he was successful at the expense of be
ing arrested himself and charged with
battery and interfering with an officer
in discharge of his duty. Judge Conlan
dismissed the interference accusation
an.l continued the battery charge until
the prosecution can bolster It with ad
ditional testimony.
â¢ â¢ â¢
Lottie Gonzales (colored) made hide
ous grimace at Judge Fritz when he
sentenced her to ten days for vagrancy,
and when he promptly added twenty
days to the term she bit. her nether Hd
to prevent the utterance of vitupera
tion, that certainly would hayÂ« bÂ»ten
imprudent. Her husband, a mulatto
named George Peterson, committed sui
cide one day last week after she in
formed him that her affection had been
irretrievably transferred to one "Chuf
fey" Turner, a negro "trusty" in the
County Jail.
Nineteen-year-old George Anderson,
convicted of having stolen candy and
scrap iron, gasped in sheer amazement
when Judge Mogan intimated intention
to send him to a reformatory school,
"Why, me folks are willing to pay for
all I s*wiped! "he exclaimed indignantly.
"Come along!" hissed the bailiff, Jerk-
Ing him away from the bench.
"Well, can youse beat dat for injus
tice?" soliloquized Master Anderson.
â¢ â¢ â¢
Hardly less indignant than Master
Anderson was Mrs. Rosie Bearyosa of
San Jose when Judge Mogan questioned
the moral aspect of her seven years'
residence out of wedlock with one
Frank Smith, also of the Garden City.
"Why, Judge, I'm a widow and he's
a single man," she said, with elevated
eyebrows denoting surprise.
"Then why don't you get married?"
his Honor inquired.
"Because I had one experience of
that kind and I don't want another,"
was the reply.
Mrs. Bearyoea and Mr. Smith were
quarreling In a Stockton street lodg
ing-house at 6 o'clock Sunday morning,
when Patrolman P, Riley arrested
them.
"Fighting Just like married folk, I
presume," remarked the court, but the
sarcasm was lost upon the lady. The
fine was $5 apiece, and Frank paid for
both.
William Arnold, also young in
years, was accused of holding exalted
membership in a "gang" of mischiev
ous boys whose habitat is the inter
section of Alabama street and Pre
cita avenue. Patrolman Robl told
Judge Mogan that the pranks played
by the lads were most annoying -to the
street car crews, who had complained
of them. Dummies made up to re
semble human beings were placed
across the track, a telegraph pole
was felled and likewise disposed of
and rocks -suspended by strings from
trolley wires smashed the windows of
cars passing underneath. But the of
ficer could not swear that Master Ar
nold did any of those things, and the
Judge perforce ordered dismissal.
Mrs. Harry Rule, after having her
husband arrested for battery, wore
large smoked-glass spectacles when
she appeared in the court of Judge
Fritz, her evident intent being to con
ceal from the bench the two black
eyes behind them, but his Honor de
tected the trick and spoiled it by or
dering Mr. Rule into custody for in
vestigation.
William Detrkh, a morphine user,
was so affected by the drug that when
Judge Mogan sentenced him to three
months for vagrancy he shouted,
â¢What in hâlh â 1 do you mean by that,
when you know I came out of Jail
only a week ago?" He was hurried
beyond earshot.
Five tramps arrested for sleeping
in a Southern Pacific freight car in
formed Judge Fritz that they had
paid a brakeman 50 cents apiece for
the privilege, and one of them further
averred that he having only one leg
was helped into the car by the spec
ulative "brakey." The story Is being
Investigated by the corporation's at
torney.
Patrolman A. T. Rier was provoked
to arrest Thomas Lane and John
Crame, small boys, by unmerited allu
sions to his physique uttered by a
"gang" of which they were active
members. While pacing his lonely beat
on Eighth street, the officer informed
Judge Mogan, his ears were assailed as
he passed Clementina street by dis
paraging comment on his person ema
nating from masculine Juvenility as
sembled at two corners of the thor
oughfares mentioned. When he taxed
one crowd with authorship of the criti
cism It credited them to the other
throng, and thus he was bandied about
until patience waned and he arrested
Masters Lane and Crame and charged
them with having disturbed the peace,
his object In so doing being not so
much to have them Jailed as to have
their companions deterred by fear from
continuing their railery of him every
time he strutted in their immediate
vicinage.
While the complainant did not plume
himself qn being an Adonis â indeed, no
person could be more keenly apprecia
tive of his physical imperfections than
he was â there was such a thing as
working a Joke to death, and that's
what he considered the two defendants
and their chums guilty of. What did
they call him? Oh, he could not re
member all the descriptive terms em
ployed by them, but their remarks were
invariably offensive. "Where did he get
that shape?" was one oft-repeated
query overheard by him, and his corpu
lency was freely twitted. Without go
ing into detailed quotation, he would
say that every affront ingenious minds
could conceive anent hla figure were
hurled at him.
As neither Master Lane nor Mas
ter Crame could positively be Identi
fied as authors of the exasperating al
lusions, the Judge was inclined to dis
miss them with the customary repri
mand and caution, and indeed had so
disposed of Master Crame when the
complainant asked for and obtained a
continuance in the case of Master
Lane, whose mother, it was averred,
had pronounced him an Incurable hu
morist, unable to keep -his tongue
quiet when he could think of some
thing to say which he considered fun
ny, however biting it might be. So
the mater was subpenaed to appear
and tell the court what she knows of
her son's penchant for voicing wit
with stings.
Five ruralists were fined $5 apiece
by Judge Mogan for having violated
the anti-expectoration ordinance last
Saturday afternoon on Market-street
sidewalks.
Thomas Williams was hurling rocks
at a window in the office of Chief of
Police Dlnan when Patrolman "Char
lie" Brown arrested him and after he
had pleaded that he was marked for
death by the Freemasons, who had
chased him from Santa Rosa to this
city. Judge Mogan sent him to the
Lunacy Commissioners for investiga
tion.

OIL MAN'S GIFT
CLEAN ENOUGH
Ministerial Union of City
Refuses to Join Protest
to the American Board
AIL MONEY IS TAINTED
Dr. Adams Says Rockefeller
Is JSo Worse Than Others
Whose Aid Church Accepts
The Congregational Ministers' Union
of San Francisco, by more than a two
thirds vote, refused yesterday to join
in the protest against acceptance by
the American Board of John D. Rocke
feller's gift of $100,000. The matter of
drawing the line as to "clean money"
was thoroughly discussed and Rocke
feller was accounted no worse than
thousands of men whose contribution*
to churches are received with fulsome
gratitude.
Dr. George C. Adams, in an exhaust
ive review of the methods of business
men in accumulating wealth and of the
ethics of giving and receiving, said in
part:
The particular point on which the con
science appears Is that by accepting the
money w* put ourselves In such relation to
the giver that we are sharers in whatever dis
honor may attach to him because of the way
in which he got his money.
It iÂ» a most peculiar claim and indicates a
very one-sided view of the moral question in
volved. There Is a large class of people who
claim that money for the church and its mis
sionary work must be only clean money.
Well, grant it; what do you mean by clean
money? The effort to answer this question in
volves us in inextricable difficulties.
We begin at once to say that the money of
a saloon-keeper Is dirty money and should not
be accepted for religious work.
What right have you to single out this man,
and pass by the one who gives short weight
and poor measure? There are good men going
through the world making questions of con
science In the manner indicated and leaving
a train of weakness and misfortune behind
them.
The Savior refused to act as Judge of his
fellowman; it would be wise for his disciples
to follow in his footateDS.
There Is no clean money; every dollar of
it is tainted with sin. We are assuming to
decide that certain kinds of sin are mon
heinous than others. We are putting our
selveÂ» In the predicament of the Methodist
church that singles out cardplaylng, dancing
and theater-going, and cays, "These are sin
ful amusements, and you must refrain from
them."
It is the weakest spot in that grand church,
and we cannot afford to make one like It.
At the present time every Important church
has prominent members who are Interested in
combinations, and who manage to make a
success of what they are doing â the methods
and the spirit are permeating the business life
of tfce nation. "
â Wirti business methods as they are we will
say there are 100,000 men every one of them
trying to get advantage of all the rest. There
is not one of this number who Is not prepared
to wage war to the knife on the business of
all the others.
Of all the number there are but a few who
come out of the struggle enormously wealthy.
We have taken the money of 90.000 of these
men whenever they offered It, and no one
proposes to discontinue taking It: but when
one of those who has made a great success of
it offers to give, we turn him down, not be
cause he was morally wrong, but because he
has made a success of It.
Every one of the other thousands Is just as
bad and is cursing his luck because he has
not been as shrewd as the winners.
The story of the rise of the Standard Oil
is the story of the rise of the beef trust, of
the great railroad corporations, of every kind
of a combination of any size that exists In this
country to-day.
The churches everywhere are helped by men
who are doin* the very things that we ac
cuse Mr. Rockefeller of doing.
By making the distinction and saying that
this Is dirty money, we practically say that
the money we do receive is clean money; and
a great deal of It comes from the very men
who would be Rockefellers If they could.
The habit of singling out certain Individ
uals and holding them up to public reproba
tion belongs to the newspapers and had best
be left to them; they sell papers by it and
stir up class feeling that they can afterward
take advantage of.
"We ministers ought to be ashamed of our
selves for Joining in it. It Is not our prov
ince We are out of our element when we
try It. We are likely to suffer from it If we
persist. In this particular instance we are
pretty sure to cut the nerve of a great deal of
giving.
If I were a business man, with a great deal
of money, and found that by attempting to
help the kingdom of God I laid myself ifable
to being held up and having all my motives
and methods paraded before the public and
the means by which I had gotten the money
called Into question, not one dollar of my
money would ever go to the people who dldT
such things.
Many a man has been led to a right rela
tlon to God by first giving money to help
some religious work and then looking In to
find what has been accomplished by his gift
lam not defending Standard Oil I detest
the cold-blooded, unsympathetic business spirit
like that of war. that never halts to see if
some one is being hurt, but marches relent
leFFly on, enriching itself at the expense of
others.
The preponderance of the sentiment
was in favor of accepting the gift,
fully two-thirds of the ministers favor
ing the views advanced by Dr. Adams.
A resolution by the Rev Mr. Rader
that members of the Congregational
Ministers' meeting of San Francisco
and vicinity join in the protest against
the acceptance of the gift of $100,000 by
Rockefeller to the American Board
was laid on the table.

general secretary International Sun
day-School Association, addressed a
union meeting of ministers yesterday
in the auditorium of the Y. M. C. A.
His association represents 29,000,000 pu
pils of the United States, Canada and

THE FISH AND GAME SHOW.
THL first exhibition of the Forest. Fish and Game Association
i? a success, in the material of the exhibit and in attendance.
Tt was a novelty here and the projectors exercised their faculty
and taste in gathering the exhibit. It is a mistake to suppose lh<it
H cultivates, or is intended to cultivate, the game-killing habit. Ihe
proper taking of game for legitimate use is entirely justifiable, but
its wasteful extermination has always been repulsive to the true
-.portsman. Cooper uttered the law when he made his hero, Xatty
Rumpo. say : "The man who will shoot a doe with a fawn by her
:nust badly need buckskin breeches." Now a step further
has heen taken in all game regions, and the killing of doe is for
bidden under all circumstances.
â¢h ( ireen solved the problem of the fish supply when he
at lish eggs could be taken, fertilized by the mill, and
hatched in any quantity. Put for Seth Green this coast could
never have had shad or striped bass. All of our shad come from
OO e Sg* taken from one female fish that was caught in the
1 )elaware River, and *mr striped bass are all from eggs taken from
the waters of Maryland. In like manner we have stocked our moun
ims with all varieties of Eastern trout, and we have sent
OUT rainbow and other fine native trout. By the process used
by the National Fish Commission it is said that an acre of water is
made to yield as much f<W, a< an acre of land. Had not Seth Green
i hi*- knowledge of nature into practical results the shad, sal
sad many other food fishe<= of the migratory species would be
i xtirct. -As it is. *he supply is made to keep pace with the demand
and many States have fish hatcheries, and the business has become as
and successful as the hatching of chickens in incubators.
It would be a supreme victory of man* partnership with nature
if the same results could be achieved in the multiplying and pre
serving of our large game on land. Of course men hunger to occupy
â¢be land for other uses, and the food and cover for game are destroyed
in the process of human occupancy. But. in the timbered and nioun
kates especially, there arc large areas out of which man cannot
make a home. Defended from fire these regions will always furnish
feltd grazing for deer, elk and moose.
n Bt, Fish and Game Association by this exposition tries
ulcate this policy <>f game preservation. Tt discourages the
hide hunter and the man who slays for the sake of slaughter and
â it references to his need of the game he gets. This State has
peculiar facilities for the permanence of large game. The shelter of
our mountain forests gives the game a chance for its life, and by
ting the doe*- and suppressing the hide hunter and the man who
to get a bag. regardless of his use of it. and of the preservation
of a future supply, we may increase all of the big game that has
v<t heen already exterminated. By applying the principles that Seth
Green made a success in assuring the fish supply, we may restock
nountains with elk and .perhaps with antelope.
The exhibit i* rich in specimens of feathered game. This is
more easy of preservation than the game that runs but cannot fly.
Our grouse, quail and waterfowl are the finest found anywhere in
thr Tnion. The species can be almost indefinitely added to. The
Montezum? quail of Mexico and the large and fine Mongolian pheas
ant would flourish here under proper protection. The Montezuma
misil is larger than ours, being between it and our brown pheasant,
and is a fine game bird. The Mongolian pheasant is the king of wild
bird<*. except where his primacy is disputed by the wild turkey. In
Oregon this pheasant, under proper protection, has enormously mul
tiplied and is common in the Umpqua and Willamette valleys and in
ail the region between the Coast Range and the Cascades. It should
be introduced here. The foothill country is an ideal location for it.
and if the blueiays and coyotes, which eat the eggs and the un
fledged young, are kept in subjection, this fine bird should flourish.
The association is teaching its first lesson in the art of assisting
nature in the preservation of her beautiful and useful creature*. It
should not be content with this lesson, but should spread abroad the
literature of the subject and promote a spirit of conservation and
not of promiscuous slaughter. With the public properly educated
California would secure a store of land game as inexhaustible as her
supply of food fish, and there would be enough of both for the rea
sonable needs of all. To this end the association should hold stated
public meetings, in the lecture room of the Academy of Sciences, for
well considered addresses upon the propagation and preservation of
game. In these the habits of wild game should be disclosed and dis
cussed. In such a course of enlightening lectures students of nature
and lovers of the forest, like Joaquin Miller and Thompson-Seton.
could be used to spread abroad the love of nature and of her forests
and her wild creatures, and Dr. Jordan could give information of
priceless value about our fishes and their habits and food importance.
With all this available knowledge and information at hand, the use
fulness of the Forest. Fish and Game Association is unlimited, and
we are sure that it will not be permitted to spend itself in this single
exhibition.
SANTO DOMINGO.
WHEN the Senate failed to ratify the Santo Domingo treat y
The Call said that having rejected the President's views, the
Senate could not leave the matter vacant, but must say what
it proposed to do to save the nations face and vindicate the Monroe
doctrine. The Senate adjourned with several foreign countries pre
paring to protect their citizens by a hostile demonstration, in de
fiance of our hegemony of the hemisphere.
It waÂ« an emergency in which the President acted with char
acteristic energy in protection of our rights and our national dignity.
The constitution says that "The President shall take care that the
laws be faithfully executed." It is not straining any point to say
that the Monroe doctrine has the force of law, projected into inter
national affairs. Mr. Cleveland g^ve to it a distinct vitality as a
rule of conduct for the nation in this hemisphere. When the
Senate refused its co-operation in the enforcement of this national
rule the President clearly was invested with the power to prevent its
defiance or disuse, and his failure to do so would have been a failure
in his duty. He immediately entered into a tentative arrangement
with Santo Domingo, by assent of that troubled Government, which
prevented the seizure of its seaports and confiscation of its revenues
by Italy and Belgium. He preserved the Monroe doctrine intact,
and when the Senate meets again it will find a status quo con
sistent with our rights, and can then deal with it as far as its juris
diction goes. It is the intent of the constitution and the practice of
the Government that the President shall have authority in foreign
affairs to maintain our traditions and defend our rights, being an
Â«werable to Congress for the methods >ie uses.
If what the President has done does not meet with Congressional
fivoT, that body cannot stop at mere disagreement, willful or other
wise, but must say what it thinks ought to be done and how and by
whom. Shirking is not possible. The President does not shirk and
Congress mutt not, for the stake is too grave for trifling.
When a Government official needs a little trip he can get it free by
investigating the condition of the water in Porto Rico, inquiring into the
propogation of fleas at Panama or sailing across the Pacific to see if the
Philippines are still there. â Baltimore Sun.

I come near me again." .
" "I will come around in the
morning," said Kendrick Fal
lows, soothingly. "You are all uDset.
The passing of the customs after that
rough passage is enough to try the
strongest nerves. You will feel bet
ter in the morning."
"I shall not be at home to you in
the morning or at any other time you
call," she announced, spitefully. 'I
want you to keep away from me."
"What is the matter, dear?" he
asked anxiously. "Have I offended?"
"Offended," she repeated shrilly.
"As though your very attitude were
not an offense."
"Why," he defended, 'I thought I
carried it off very well. I battled no
bly against a desire to take you in
my arms before all those people and
"If you had," she broke in savage
ly, "I should have killed you. Was it
not enough insult that you should
press my hand and tell me how happy
I had made you?"
"Insult?" he echoed. "Wherein lay
the insult?"
"That you should suppose that I
should have come back just for your
sake."
"Of course," he said deprecatingly,
"I knew that your father cabled you,
but I supposed that you were glad of
an excuse."
Mildred stamped her foot in vexa
tion. "There you go again," she
fumed. "Why should you suppose
that I should be glad of an excuse?"
"Why." vaguely, "to get back. To
see everybody â and me."
"I suppose you thought that I paid
attention to what you said when I
went away."
"What was that?" he asked Inter
estedly.
"You wanted to bet I would not be
gone six months."
"I remember," he said, with sudden
enlightenment. "The stakes were ten
pounds of candy against â " He blun
dered a little.
"My penalty was an engagement to
you." she finished.
"I had almost forgotten," he con
fessed. "You grew so angry when I
suggested it that I put it out of my
mind."
"And yet," she insisted, "you appear
disposed to claim the forfeit."
"Mildred," he said, tenderly. "I

thought I had won your heart through
something more than a bet."
"Well." she sobbed, "you made me
feel so humiliated at the dock."
"Why?" he urged.
"Supposing that I had come back
to see you and that 1 was so anxious
to become engaged that I was willing
to dispense with the formality of a
proposal?"
"I'll propose again now, if that will
help any." he suggested.
"It's too late," she said between her
sobs.
"Then you did care for me?" he
said with an unfortunate ring of tri
umph in his voice.
"No!" she sat up very suddenly,
dry-eyed and angry. "I did. once,
think I liked you, but when you were
so horrid this morning I realized my
error."
"How was I horrid this morning?" he
asked, patiently.
"Supposing that , we were engaged
just because I came back sooner than
I wanted to."
"But I do not suppose that," he de
niecr. "I knew that your father had
cabled for you."
"Then why did you take it all for
granted?" she demanded, hurt pride in
her voice. "Don't you suppose that a
woman wants to be asked before she
becomes engaged. Don't you know that
I'd have died sooner than come back
had I known you would have put that
construction on my actions?"
"But I didn't," he repeated. "I knew
you had to come home because they
were afraid poor old Bob was worse."
"Then why should you juiQpose we
are engaged If you are not trying to
collect that horrid bet?" she sobbed.
"Because you cabled me you would
marry me," he explained.
Mildred rose to her feet, her eyes
flashing. "It seems to me," she said
angrily, "you could find a better ex
cuse than a wLcked falsehood like
that."
"But you did," he persisted. "1 wrote
and told you that I simply could not
get along without you and asked If I
could come over and make your tour
our bridal trip. You cabled back 'yes,'
and then before I could get a steamer
your father told me that you were
coming home."
"I never got such a letter," she de
clared. "And I never would send such
a cable."
"Well, I wrote the letter and got the
cable."

for me."
"That the only cablegram?"
"I sent two. The first was when I
received his message and said I would
come and the second was to tell him
the boat I sailed on."
"Did you send both?" he asked, a
smile beginning to lighten his drawn
face.
"I wrote the first. The second the
steamer agent sent for me."
"Would you mind." he asked, "writ
ing the address again?"
Defiantly she moved to the dpsk and
presently handed him a slip of paper
with a few words in fashionable and
uncertain characters. Fallows gave
a shout.
"I suppose," he explained, "if you ad
dress a cable to 'Fellows. 849 Broad
way." and the c' looks like an 'a' and
it is delivered to Fallows at the same
address that I am cleared of charges
of presumption? Your father only re
ceived the first. I supposed you had
received my letter and that was the
answer. Do you see how It was?"
Fallows had to lean very close to
the bowed head to catch the whis
pered "yes."
"Which yes is that?" he asked, ten
derly â "that you understand or tMat
you will answer my letter in the af
firmative?"
He had to bend closer yet to catch
the "Both"; so close that his lips
brushed her cheek, and lingered for a
moment unreproved. â (Copyright,

TRUNKS TAKEN
BEFORE JURY
Mysterious Evidence in
the Investigation of the
Beef Packers' Combine
FOUND IN SAFE DEPOSIT
Great Secrecy Maintained by
Officials as to the Con
tents of the Receptacles
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CHICAGO, April 10.â The contents of
eight mysterious trunks unearthed by
Government Secret Service men in the
vaults of the National Safe Deposit
Company occupied the attention to-day
of th* Federal Grand Jury, which is
investigating the business affairs of
the eo-csllfd beef trust. A subpena
ducÂ«?B tecuu for Daniel Peckham. sec
retary of the Safe Deposit Company,
was issued by Judge. Landis to force
the empany to produce the trunks in
the juryroom. The trunks were taken
to the office of District Attorney Mor
rison, where, it is said, they were
opened and their contents examined.
What the trunks contained and what
connection they have with the case is
not known, as the Government officials
refuse to discuss the matter, declining
either to deny or confirm the explana
tion current that the trunks might be-
Ltig to the packers.
However, at the time of the investi
gation by Commissioner Garfleld and
his agents, it was rumored that the
packers had two sets of accounts on
the cost of killing and dressing cattle,
only one of which was shown to Gar
field â the one favorable to the pack
ers. The inference is drawn that the
other set of book*, if such a set ex
isted, was kept from the scrutiny of
the Government officials and was lo
cated only to-day.
Another conjecture as to the con
tents of the trunks is that they con
tain the records of the Etna Trading
Company. This company is reported
to have been a sort of clearing-house
for the packing combine in the dis
pogal of such by-products as casings,
which in the early days of the pack
ing industry were destroyed as worth
less, but which to-day, it is claimed,
pay the cost of dressing cattle.
"I do not know a thing about these
trunks," said Secretary Peckham. after
having been served with the subpena.
I was served with a subpena to de
liver them to the Government officials
at once. -and. of course, did so. All I
can nay is that a large, well-dressed
man with a smooth-shaven face or)
March 23 appeared at our plac> and
deposited the trunks with us."
PLATT JOINS
WITH BLACK
NEW TORK, April 10.â The New-
York Sun, which for years has been
friendly to Senator Thomas C. Platt
and has supported him in his efforts
to lead the Republican party in this
State, says to-day that an offensive
and defensive alliance has been en
tered tnto between the Senator and
former Governor Frank S. Black. The
Sun says:
' Senator Plat* and ex-Governor Frank S.
Black have had a lone and "very satisfactory"
tal* at tV Fifth Avenue Hotel. The meet
ing- between them took place on Wednesday
evening. Every effort has been made to keep
secret the feet -that they met and - talked
over the Republican situation In the State of
New York. The news came out yesterday, and
"William Barnes Jr., chairman of the execu
tive committee of the Republican State Com
mittee; Colonel GeorrÂ« W. Dunn, ex-chairman
of the State Committee; William L.. Ward. Re
publican National CommltLeeman for the State,
and Representative John D. Wight of Dryden
are aware that Mr. Platt and Mr. Black have
come to a satisfactory understanding. . "
The Sun further says that Platt and
Black agreed to enter into an alliance
and to invite other leaders throughout
the Btate to Join them, with the ob
ject of contesting the control of the
party at the next State convention.
The machinery of the party in this
State is generally conceded to be in
control of former Governor B. B. Odell
Jr., who is chairman of the State Com
mittee. Odell at present is in Europe.

WASHINGTON, April 10.â The fol
lowing suggestions to Secretary Taft
( are contained in a memorandum of the
i Ministers representing: the west coast
i of tho South and Central American
' republics, relative to transportation
' across the isthmus of Panama: The
i propiiety of reducing railroad tariff

j and cargoes of all origins have the
I same facilities; that the work of build
\ ing the canal be not allowed to entire
i ly absorb the Panama Railroad, but
| that the railroad be utiltzed, as here
tofore, in the transportation of freight
across the isthmus.
In their memorandum, the Ministers
say:
Although the navigation companies on th*
Pacific Coast do not belong; to the Panama
Railroad Company this company has arranged
matters so that the northern coast may bÂ«
served exclusively by the Paclflo Mail Steam
ship Company and the southern coast by
steamship companies formed into a trust, viz:
The Pacific Steam Navigation Company and
the South American Steamship Company.
These lines, as a matter of course, take
advantage of this privilege to exact as high
rates as possible. The working of thta monop
oly is very plain: the Panama Railroad Com
pany grants transit facilities only to thÂ«> com
biuefl companies above referred to, while It
hinders and closes tho doors to other ships
outsMe of the combination arriving at Colon
or Panama.
Owing to the same monopoly the Paclflo

Dr. yon Tess Toob Tries His
Cure for Laziness Upon
a New York Policeman
IT WORKS A MIRACLE
Possibly Authentic Account
Tells of Eighty - Seven
Arrests Quickly Made
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW TORK, April 10.â Dr. Wolf
gang yon Tess Toob to-day received
a small quantity of the new anti
toxin that overcomes laziness and im
mediately set out to find a subject to
experiment upon. Chancing to come
across a policeman leaning against a
building, the professor invited him to
take a drink in a nearby saloon. While
the officer was investigating the lunch
counter, the professor put a drop of tha
anti-toxin into his glass of beer. The
bluecoat drank the foaming beverage
unsuspectingly.
Shortly afterward the "cop" rushed
out, shouting there were burglars in
a house in the next block and returned
with three struggling men in his grasp.
"Professor, hold these while I run
down the street and pinch a poolroom,"
he exclaimed.
He borrowed an ax and soon returned
with twelve more prisoners.
By this time 500 persons had gathered
about Yon Tess Toob and Dr. Dolling
ton of the Health Department, who ac
companied the scientist.
"Make a big circle and hold hands,"
shouted the policeman, rushing his new
prisoners into the center of the ring.
"I have more work for me."
When eighty-seven prisoners had
been driven into the corral and the
street was blocked by onlookers, the
energetic policeman suddenly retired
to a bootblack stand and sat down.
The anti-toxin had worn off.
Yon Tess Toob and Dr. Dollington
then left the place and on encounter
ing a couple of messenger boys stroll
ing leisurely along, the professor 'stole
up behind and Jabbed a hypodermic
syringe into one youth's wrist. The
boy disappeared like magic.
Professor yon Tess Toob then came
across a gang of street sweepers. .
"I have here a new drink called
swoxie," called the scientist. "StÂ«>~ up,
one and all â swoxie is free."
No sooner was the gang inoculated
than it set furiously at work and
cleaned the whole block in eighteen
minutes.

Patterson in connection with the Young

witnesses in the murder trial.
The motion for a delay was strongly

the postponement Recorder Goff said he
did not think that the interests of the

CHANTILLY WINS IN COLORSOF MILLIONAIRE CLARK
Ocyrohe Outsprints
a Cluster of
Fast Ones.
FRED E. MULHOLLAND
After a prolonged absence, during
â which time he broke into the New York
game. High Chancellor appeared a* a
t-tarter at Oakland again yesterday in
the last number on the card.
It was a six and a half furlong spin,
which Tocolaw enjoyed a decided
call ln the ring. High Chancellor Just
before leaving L.os Angeles began show
â i. return to form after a siege of
illness, and the horse's stable connec
tion? were sweet on his chances yes
trrday. Some few occupying reserved
ained 8 when the odds were
first posted, but the rank and flle took
5 and 6 for theirs.
After shaking off The Mist, Tocolaw
assumed the lead turning into the
stretch, and was then challenged by
Knapp with High Chancellor. Class
told, as it always will, the latter horse
ng by more than a length. Morita
tame with a belated rush, and might
have been second, with a chance to
had the filly not been cut off.
THREE FAVORITES IX FRO XT.
Favorites divided honors with longer
yuoted ones, capturing three of the
purses. Some splendid sport was fur
nished before a large attendance.
Chantilly, a chestnut colt by Salva
uon. owned by Charles W. dark, the
young Montana millionaire, was made
the medium of a plunge in the two
year-old scramble. From threes the
quickly fell to 17 to 10, and the
youngster won galloping from Legal '
Form and Midmont. Spinosa, the sec- :
ond choice, met with interference soon !
after the atart. finishing fourth.
Jimmy Coffey'e Ocyrohe received '
wise backing to win the six-furlong ,
run following, which he did easily at )
odds of 4 to 1. Sterling Towers, an out- '
elder, with Travers in the saddle, made
â c running, finally succumbing by
a. couple of lengths. Toupee, the even
money favorite, had some 111 luck at !
the start, ending up in the show.
bINCEIIITY BELLE A WINNER.
Tommy Taylor, astride Sincerity
â¢ another even money chance, had
some tall riding to land* the mare
winner of the mil** selling affair The
â rat choice is a slow beginner, and
Taylor got her up Just in time to nab
and beat Spondoolix. an 8 to 1 shot,
a neck. After acting as one of the
pacemakers, Cotillion dropped the
fchow to Royal Red, a 15 to 1 out- '
Rider. Baker appeared barren of !
speed.
Bab. from the stable of Billy Cahill.
made a hop, step and jump of the mile
and fifty yard selling run. The mare
closed a Plight favorite over Best Man,
and passing Prince Palatine on the i
stretch turn, downed Golden Ivy like
breaking sticks. Best Man seemed
perfectly free from speed, at no stage :
ng like a candidate for first hon
ors. The show went to Possart.
It looked as if Neva Lee. favorite
.: for the fifth, a five and a half furlong
sprint, was beaten on her merits by
Ruby. The pair were out in front
throughout, the Jennings entry, a 6
to 1 shot, outlasting thÂ« first choice i
and winning the decision by hallf a
length. Larson on Peggy O'Neil fin
ished in third place, a head before

"Big Bill" Knapp is becoming am
bitious again. He piloted three win
ners yesterday. If Jakie Jones beats
him out at the end of the season, the
latter will have to do some hustling.
On the closing day of the meeting
at Oakland the association will hang
up $1000 for a condition race over
the cup distance, two and a quarter
miles. In addition to first money, the
owner of the winner will receive a
beautiful cur valued at $200.

RIVAL MANAGERS
SHY OF VOTES
Neither Coffroth Nor Levy
Has Enough Supervisors
Pledged to Secure Paper
BOXERS ARE TRAINING
Britt Keturas From Harbin
Springs and White Con
tinues Work at Larkspur
The resolution providing for a grant
of the April professional boxing permit
did not come up yesterday before the
Board of Supervisors. Neither Mana
ger Jimmy Coffroth nor Morris Levy
has succeeded in securing the neces
sary ten votes, respectively, for the
Yosemite Club or the Hayes Valley
Club.
Manager. Coffroth, who has the Britt-
White fight on his hancs for this
month, is going ahead with his ar
rangements, expecting that matters
will straighten themselves out- There
is such a tangled akein to unravel that
a solution favorable to Coffroth seems
outside the bounds of possibility. One
person interested in the fight was so
undiplomatic as to publicly crit
icize a man who has done a
lot of high-class refereeing here.
He is a power politically and he
set about at once to cut down the num
ber of votes favorable to the Yosemite
Club. He Is known to have reduced it
by at least one vote, which means
much when votes are so hard to get.
Morris Levy said last night that he
would be able to get the permit next
week if he wanted it. He claims a
number of his friends in the Board of
Supervisors gave Coffroth until yester
day to show that he could secure the
requisite number of votes. As he fail
ed to do so it is claimed they will now
turn their strength over to Levy.
There is a possibility that Coffroth
would turn the Britt-White event over
to Levy if the latter had the permit.
Coffroth stands to lose $3500 if he is un
able to promote the affair and might
be glad to get out without loss. If the
fighters want to appear before Levy's
club they will receive a flat 50 per cent,
with no bonus on the side. This is the
ultimatum of the Hayes Valley Club
manager.
There has been some talk of holding
the flght without a permit, but this
does not seem likely. While some of
the city authorities are friendly with
Coffroth and might not interfere, there
are others equally strong who are op
posed to him and who could call on the
Sheriff to prevent the flght under such
conditions.
The persons In control of the boxing
pavilion at Colma believe it is a val
uable piece of property in view of the
flght situation here. They will expect
a big rental for it if overtures are
made to hold the flgh,t there.
With the various club managers at
war their friends have enlisted in the
flght and Interesting bits of gossip re
garding recent fights are being bandied
about. One of these choice bits is to
the effect that the people behind one ot
the fights were so sure of their
position that the public money paid in
advance for tickets was taken out of
the strong box and was wagered on
the man who ultimately won. If such
financiering could go on for a time
undisturbed they would soon be bid
ding for control of Standard Oil. It
seems likely the promoters will do for
boxing what Senator Ralston failed to
accomplish.
Jimmy Britt returned yesterday from
Harbin Springs, where he has been
living out of doors for the past two
weeks. He will settle down to train
ing at once.
HARD-HITTING BOXERS
TRAINING IN EARNEST
Much Is Expected of the Bout on Fri-
day Night Between Lundie
and Cairns.
Bob Lundie and Bob Cairns, the
boxers who are to clash in the even
ing's windup at Woodward's Pavilion
on Friday night before the Hayes Val
ley Athletic Club, are both working
with a will for their bout. They can
be depended on to make the going in
teresting to the fight fans. This will
be the second time the boys have met
in the ring, their first battle being the
star event of the last Olympic Club
tournament. An extra round was
necessary to satisfy the judges that
Lundie had a shade.
The other main event, in which
Johnnie Crowe and Abe Label are to
mix. is in itself a star attraction. The
boys have proved the best of thelr
class. Crowe is the champion, but
Label is considered to have a good
chance by those In the know. The
little fellows are to weigh in at 122
pounds ringside.
A special bout between the two
promising welters, Dick Sullivan and
Harry Riley, also looks to be of the
main event order. The boys have
fought before and made an exciting
go of their last battle. Sullivan won
a close decision, which Riley is con
fident of reversing 1 .
The balance of the programme will
include four likely appearing fights,
in which the best boys in their respec
tive classes will be seen in action. The
young scrappers are at work nightly
at the Hayes Valley Athletic Club's
gymnasium.

the wearing of long dresses by women.
He advocated prohibiting the wearing

OARSMEN FIND
A NEW COURSE
Acting on the Suggestion of
a Cornell Oarsman in The
Call They Try Sansalito
MAY RACE THERE SOON
With the Consent of Wash
ington Their Contest May
Be Held Off Marin Shore
STANFORD UNIVERSITY. April 10.
The crews representing Stanford Uni
versity and the University of Washing
ton will meet this week on the water
for the first time in the history of the
two universities. The exaot date has
not yet been decided upon, but It will
be either next Thursday or Friday. It
was intended to have the race on the
Redwood Slough, where there is a good
straightaway course of a mile or more,
but late this afternon Manager Barrett
of the Stanford crew returned from San
Francisco with the news that he ha<i
found a superb course at Sausallto.
This was brought to his attention by
a letter from an old Cornell oarsman
published in The Call. It is expected
that this course will ultimately sol\>:
the problem of suitable waters for a
race with the University of California.
The trouble with the Redwood course
is that there are not suitable accommo
dations for the spectators who would
naturally be attracted by the race. At
Sausalito there is an electric railway
following the shore, and many thou
sands could witness the contest from
the cars. The place is so wide that
there would be room for bay craft of
all descriptions, and followers of boat-
Ing would be enabled to watch every
foot of the two-mile struggle. If Wash
ington will consent the race will be
held at Sausalito.
Although the cardinal crew has not
been finally selected it is probable the
following men will appear in the four
oared boat on the day of the race:
Stroke. W. H. Dole (captain); No. 3. F.
Zimmerman; No. 2, B. Bryan: bow, H.
G. Butterfleld. A merry struggle for
coxwain is in progress between E. V.
Henley and C. W. Henderson.
The Washington squad of oarsmen
will arrive at Stanford campus to-mor
row.

WOULD IGNORE
COMMERCE ACT
Interior Department Pro
poses to Accept Rebates
From Southern Pacific
HITCHCOCK IS REBUKED
Told by Comptroller of Cur
rency That He Has Ko
Kight to Violate the Law
WASHINGTON, April 10.â Comp
troller of .1 the Treasury has rendered a
decision^ in r which he ;'â : criticizes 'â '. the
proposed action of . the Secretary of the
Interior In accepting: rebates from the
Southern Pacific Railroad on freight of
contractors engaged In work"; in ;-thÂ«
West under the Irrigation and reclama
tion act. The Comptroller says:
By what authority the .Government- can
contract " with a railroad that a contractor's
plant - *hall receive a rebate in ; freights not
applicable to oth-r shippers is beyond my j
comprehension. If this right exists it might'
is well extend to flour, hay and other commodi
ties and the vehicles used by a contractor la
making deli' to thÂ» Government. * â _â 
The Government, above all others, should not
lie a Darty to a violation of either, tbs, letter
or spirit of, the interstate commerce act. as
regards thÂ« question at rebates. It should not
engage In questionable transactions in order
that a savins of a -few dollars may bÂ« had.
especially when â  this saving results -In th*
tearing down of a law which experience proves
It is very difficult, if not Impossible, to en
force. -.. Ââ¢Â«; . " -â¢-'â¢â¢ ,-"â¢â  .-..-.
The Interior Department replied to
this argument, insisting upon the legal
ity of its proposed action and stating
that- the rebates in question , probably
would - amount to $1,000,000 In the next
seven years.
In the course of his : response to this
statement the Comptroller says that
the amount of these rebates being large I
is a cogent reason why the Government j
should make no mistake by being a
party to or a beneficiary of the viola
tion .of the law prohibiting the giving
3f discriminating rebates. He says:" \
I ' advise that before ~ you take 'rebates from
railroads on the 'carriage of property . belonging
0 the Government contractors, shipped -.by
:hem and said -for by them " at the regular
rates, you lay all the facts before thÂ« Attorney
3eoÂ«ral and procure : his opinion as to the I
legality of such transaction. Let me repeat,
1 attach no significance to the willingness of '
the railroads to grant the rebates in question. I

Declined frurn /ia.t manlfeeted last week. The

however, caused some misgiving* over the
situation and these were not en
t:re.y overcome by the inviting advance In
. tht- few strong- active stocks. The Northern
K-.mi itlfc ca-e again aseumed a dominant
I iitior in tbe d&y's market, 1 the Impelling
csiim* being the Jump in that stock Itself on
the curb to a new high record of 169%.
A 1 â¢-.< urnÂ« time Great Northern preferred
Mi the Exchange shot up to a new record
price at 323. These movements stimulated -an
f dive demand for Union Pacific and again
'. yrioa the tide of rumors regarding that
rroperty and the far-reaching projects of the
i-cwerc in control of it, to be further led by
xhf (100.000,000 preferred stock increase. The
immedate cause of the movement in Northern
itself was the circulation of a
rumen- that a liberal cash dividend would be
distributed in connection with the red!stribu>
tlon of assets, of tbe corporation. This rumor
â¢w-a* denied. The day's favorite form for the
tuppoeed nature of the Union Pacific project
was . the purchase of a controlling interest in
Atchison. and that stock was benefited ac
f . ogl>. St Paul moved as usual. In sym
puthy. \Â«Â» York -Central and the North
Â«Â»est*rn stocks, or. the contrary, were rather
heavy
â  .There, was a king movement - also !
in AmalKamated Copper on vague intimations
of a proposed increase in the dividend rate.
This proved lees effective on sentiment toward
the * general list than did last week's wide
movement In United States Steel preferred
That stock . wÂ«s under restraint to-day with
free feeding of the demand whenever the price
approached the closing level of last week.
Heading made some special show of strength
In company with -Olawars and Hudson but
the movement did not extend further In the
rronp of coalers. Conjecture was busy during
the day over the condition to t* shown by
the Government report of the winter wheat
crop. . The report was not published during
I tbe hours of trading, but expectation was very
confident of its favorable character owing, to
the high condition reported recently by au
thorities cf the different States. This was an
Influence, In keeping down the price of wheat
as It was of holding up the price of the
granger railroad stocks. It Is not Improbable
however, that the desire to see the official
figures had Its influence in prompting the wait
ins attitude of the trading and caused some
selling of stocks her* for foreign aoeount on
sny advance. r*oretgTi exchange made another
advance. Money conflaued rather firm and
loaned on call again at 4 per cent. The day's
rather laborious â¢nd uneven strength was un
convincing to sentiment and gave place to an
abrupt reaction in the last naif hour. The
unloading of ' stocks " was supposed to be doe
in - part to the unsetttement tn thÂ« Chicago
wheat market. 'The closing was irregular.

CABRERA HOLDS
HIM PRISONER
New York Lawyer in Jail
at Guatemala City, Denied
Either Trial or Freedom
FRIENDS 1 EFFORTS FAIL
City of Sydney Brings News
of American Attorney's
Plight in a Foreign Land
The steamship City of Sydney, which
arrived yesterday from Central Ameri
can ports, brings word of the plight in
Guatemala City of a New York law
yer, Gardner by name. Gardner is, and
hae been for months, in the Govern
ment prison. The efforts of his friends
have availed nothing to secure release
even a trial for the imprisoned
American, who was sent to Jail in the
first instance, it is said, for alleged
tnpt of court.
Gardner was a passenger on the City
of Sydney about six months ago from
Panama to San Jose de Guatemala. He
was on his way to Guatemala city to
press the claim of a ciient against the
Government. As far as the people on
the City of Sydney could learn these
claims arose from the Governments al
leged failure to keep faith in the mat
ter of certain concessions made to
Gardner's client.
Gardner ie said to have made a
eTron? showing, but before the matter
was derided the Judge found the Amer
ican lawyer In contempt and soldiers
conducted Gardner to the cell he still
occupies.
United States Consul Winslow, sta
tiored at Guatemala City, is said to
have championed Gardner's cause, but
Winsiow'g efforts are said to have been
rendered futile by the inaction of Unit
ed States Minister Leslie Coombs.
Coombs and President Cabrera are said
to be very friendly and at San Jose it
rÂ» eaid that Gardner's 6tay in jail
would probably last as long as the law
yer was likely to renew his battle in
the court* for his client's claim against
Cabrera.
According to passengers on the City
of Sydney the feeling in Guatemala
against Cabrera is intense. The pros
pect of any Immediate revolution, how
ever, is said to be remote, as Cabrera
has established a spy system, by
means of which he is kept informed of
every move hi 6 enemies make. The
Jails in Guatemala are filled with men
suspected of designs against the chief
executive. The revolutionary force
formed in Mexico ha 6 been dispersed
by Diaz and the discontented citizens
of the republic are at present In far
from an organized state.
About a year ago Cabrera made a
law declaring the paper money of the
republic of Guatemala legal tender for
all debts Germans and other foreign
ers have large sums invested in Guate
mala. Thi* money was lent on the un
derstanding that repayments should be
-â¢â  gold basis Cabrera's new law
substituting paper money, of which it
takfs 513 to $15 to equal $1 in gold has
amounted to a repudiation of these ob
ot, Hoping for a repeal of the
r a revolution which would bring
â a new man to the head of affairs in
Guatemala, many claims have never
been presented. Under the law the
-jf-btor cannot force the creditor to ac
â¢he paper money unless the cred
itor makes a demand for payment,
"hen he ie obliged to accept what is
little better than stage money.
fsbrera controls the army, however,
end for the present ie the whole thing
in Guatemala.
WAXT TO FIXD PAREJfTS

Society for the Prevention of Oodty
to Children Desires an
Explanation.
Secretary White of the Society for
the Prevention of Cruelty to Children
would be pleased to learn the where
abouts of John McGee and his wife.
He wishes them to explain why they
deserted their bright little two-year
old child Harold.
A man callÂ«d on the secretary sev
eral days ago. saying that he was go
ing away and asking the society to
care for the two-year-old, who, he
said, had been left with him last Feb
ruary by Mrs. John McGee. The caller
and his wife took care of the little
one vt> to last week, when it became
necessary for them to leave the State.
Secretary White discovered that
Harold was suffering: from a skin dis
ease and he was sent to the City and
County Hospital, and later, at the so
ciety's request. Judge Murasky com
mitted him to a State institution. In
the meantime the parent*, cannot be
found. The mother. It -4a believed,
lived somewhere on Howard street,
between Third and Ninth.

CONSPIRACY
CHARGED BY
THE BANK
Pacific Coast Savings So
ciety Files an Action to
Recover Large Sum From
Three Prominent Citizens
DEFENDANTS FORMER
MEMBERS OF BOARD
Wendell Easton. C. S. Bene
dict and Harry Francis Arc
Summoned to Court to Ac
count for Fortune Loaned
Scandal has again risen from the
ruins of the Pacific Coast Savings So
ciety. A suit was filed yesterday by the
savings society in which it is alleged
that Wendell Easton, C. S. Benedict
and Harry Francis, former members
of the board, took from, the coffers of
the wrecked financial institution the
sum of $200,000 through the operation of
a shrewd conspiracy. The allegations
are of a nature that means the rekind
ling of the battle signals and the re
alignment of the forces that met in
year 6 past to war for the assets scat
tered by the crash. The suit was filed
by Attorneys Barclay Henley and H.
K. Ascher. with T. C. Van Ness and
Samuel Rosenheim, a director of the
defunct institution since the reorgani
zation, as counsel.
ROSENHEIM'S STATEMENT
"The action is one involving many
remarkable features," said Mr. Roeen
heim last night, "and If our allegations
are sustained throughout â and we
based them on what we believe to be
substantial proof â we will recover a
sum that will go a long way toward
liquidating the claims of stockholders
and depositors who loet their savings
when the institution foundered. It has
only been after years of struggle and
Investigation that conditions that have
now come to light were developed. It
is our contention that the stockholders
and depositors of the bank were de
frauded out of the large sum we de
mand â $200,000 â by a carefully planned
conspiracy."
In the complaint it is alleged that
Wendell Easton dominated in the con
spiracy and gained the balance of pow
er in the board, through the willing co
operation of Benedict and Francis. It
is further stated in the complaint that
AVendell Easton used clerks in his em
ploy as "dummies," by means* of which
large sums of money were drawn from
the bank upon insufficient security.
Clerks in the employ of Mr. Easton.
it is alleged, were given control of
pieces of property upon which they
sought loans from the now defunct in
stitution, the loans asked being far in
excess of the value of the property,
frequently many times in excess of the
value. As Easton, Benedict and Fran
cis held the balance of power these ap
plications for loans, accompanied by
false appraisements, -would be favor
ably passed upon, it Is claimed, and
the loans made. But, it is alleged,
these loans never reached the pockets
of the "dummy" borrowers, but were
retained by the conspirators.
MORE SERIOUS CHARGES.
It is further charged in the complaint
that the defendants loaned various
sums of money contrary to law upon
personalty, stocks and bonds of doubt
ful value, and that subsequently
these securities were again hypothecat
ed upon a false basis of valuation. It
is also set forth that evidence has been
found that money was loaned upon the
stocks of several companies, including
the Gold Standard Mining and Milling
Company and the Santa Fe Springs
Land Company, in two of which com
panies at least Benedict held a con
trolling Interest. Another allegation is
to the effect that sums of money were
loaned at different times to the "dum
mies" employed in the conspiracy upon
promissory notes without security of
any kind.
The complaint in itself makes a large
volume and each of its allegations, it
is stated, have been made only after
the most careful examination of the
books. Before the ruit is ended an
other chapter, it seems now, will have
been written In the story of the Pa
cific Coast Savings Society not less in
teresting than the many that are now
within the public mind.
The suit was filed late yesterday aft
ernoon and will be assigned for hearing
this morning.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, APRIL 11, 1905.
MARGARET ANGLIN'S ART
SHOWS DIVERSITY
HerGenlusGlvenFine
Scope In 'The Lady
Paramount."
PLEASING WORK AT
OTHER THEATERS
Central and Alcazar
Present Bills of
Strength,
One of those peculiar plays, which
In the hands of any other but real
soul-stirring actors would be a dismal
failure, but which, with Margaret Ang
lin and Frank Worthing in the lead
in? roles, is a brilliant exhibition of the
art which is next to music and poetry,
was the offering at the California last
night. It is titled "The Lady Para
mount," freely adapted from Henry
Harland's novel by Madeline Lucette
Ryley, and is in three acts, the first of
which is preparation, action and the
dawning of an exquisite love story, the
second jealousy, mistrust, indignation
and separation, and the third repent
ance and reconciliation.
In all of these moods Miss Anglin
proves to be the lady paramount in the
superb art that makes of herself and
the character one and the same per
son. In the segond act the phases of
coquetry, the tender love passages
veiled with a flimsy cloud of the light
est humor, were deliciously portrayed.
Miss Anglin is an artist almost infinite
in her variety, of chameleon power,
of protean changes, and no matter
how diverse and opposite even these
may be, the moods fit her like her
own cuticle.
'Tis a far cry from Camllle to Susan
na, Countess of San Paolo, but in the
one Miss Anglin is Camille and in the
other she is Susanna, but never Miss
Anglin. Rare, indeed, must be the
talent that can pull successfully against
the musical and social attractions of
'Lucia dl Lammermoor," done by the
Conried company, but Miss Anglin per
formed that seemingly impossible task,
and filled the California Theater with
an audience of gala gowned women and
men in evenine dress.
If the comedy had been written spe
cially for her it could not have af
forded her any more opportunity of de
picting the fleeting phases of love and
coquetry in her own unapproachable
way. Nor was the audience slow to
realize the artistic treat, and curtain
calls were frequent and persistent
enough almost to destroy the Illusion
of the play. Frank Worthing was an
admirable help to the 6tar. He has a
delightfully breezy way of making love
â almo6t as if he meant it then and
; there on the stage â and the realistic
1 manner In which he personated the
1 jealous lover in the second act fully
Justified the star's outburst of resent
ful indignation. Mrs. Thomas Whiffen,
' that sunniest old woman on the Ameri
' can stage to-day, assisted in the suc
i cess of the presentation. All the work
1 was done by these three, the rest of
I the company being merely the filling
in.
There is not much action in the
comedy. There are no fireworks of bril
liant repartee, no flashes of unexpected
humor, nothing but p. charming and
original love story told in the most
\ simple way and directly catching hold
of the sympathy and interest of the au
dience. It ends as we all want/such
stories to wind vp â with a happy mar
riage after the misunderstanding has
been unraveled and the proper apolo
! gles made.
Alcazar.
The initial production of the ro
mantic comedy, "Tom Moore," at the
Alcazar last night was highly credit
able in every detail. The piece is
founded upon the life of Ireland's
greatest poet and fairly bristles with
witty lines and quaint epigrams. John
Craig in the title role has a part much
to his liking and brings all his talent
to bear in the impersonation. While
his brogue is not quite the real ar
ticle, still Craig makes up for the de
ficiency by his painstaking efforts in
all the other requirements of the part.
Lillian Lawrence is indeed a pretty
picture aa Bessie Dyke, the Irish girl
In love with Tom. She acted with in
telligence and her love scene with
Moore was cleverly done. Elizabeth
Woodson and Mary Young played
small parts admirably and Laura
Adams was Irresistibly funny as Mrs.
Maione. Harry Hilliard acted the
part of Lord Moira admirably and
John Maher was a close second for
the favor of the audience as Buster.
John Davies was an excellent Prince
of Wales and John Sainpolis made a
polished villain of Sir Percival Love
face. Walter Belasco aad Harry Mc-
Auliffe were the best of the remaining
male characters. The school scene in
the first act was a laughable affair
and was made doubly Interesting by
the singing of Harold Forman, the boy
soprano. The play was well staged
and the costumes magnificent.
CentraL
As a drama of patriotic Interest,
"Paul Revere" was presented at the
Central last evening. Not alone did
the play Interest the school children,
of which there was a small-sized
army, but the grown folks found much
that was pleasing. The play tends to
brighten up the memory on bits of
history.
As is well known, the midnight ride
of the young hero in his attempt to
warn the minutemen of the enemy's
approach forms the nucleus of the
plot. Juliet Crosby's bright genius
was shown with splendor last night,
and so was that of Mayall, the leading"
man. Both these clever people found
ample opportunity to display the tal
ents which have won them recognition
In the theatrical world.
Mayall's fine personality shouldered
his acting qualities with neat effect.
Shumer as the villain and Corrigan in
a comedy role both deserve mention
and both were appropriately received.
Lloyd Edwards is fast coming up the
ladder. Miss Ellsmere and Myrtle
Vane won their share of praise and
Julia Blanc, with George Nicholls,
George "Webster an<3 Millar Bacon,
rounded out an evenly balanced cast.
Columbia.
This is the second and last week of
Lionel Barrymore's successful en
gagement at the Columbia Theater.
Barrymore gives a really great char
acter portrayal of the gentleman pu
gilist in the amusing Thomas comedy,
"The Other Girl." The piece moves
rapidly and with many humorous ele
ments from the very beginning. The
complications brought about by the
Inopportune meeting of parson and
pugilist is the cause of no end of com
plications. Grace Van Studdiford will
be the attraction at the Columbia
Theater commenoirifr with next Mon
starred at the head of a very large
company in De Koven's latest comic
opera, "Red Feather."
Chutes.
Murphy and Francis, whose "real
coon habits" have kept the Orpheum
audiences laughing for two weeks, are
a feature of the new programme at
the Chutes. John T. Chick and his
company of comedians offer another
howllngly funny travesty in "The
Whole Damm Family"; La Grecia gives
a pretty and daring aerial ring and
trapeze act, and the Mallory brothers,
Brooks and Halliday, renned musi
cians, singers and dancers; Mabel
Lamson, the favorite singer of Illus
trated songs, and the animatoscope
complete an excellent programme. The
feature of the amateur performance on
Thursday night will be a three-legged
race for fat girls. Commencing next
Sunday and every afternoon and even
ing thereafter for eight days, there
will be an elaborate production of the
spectacular musical extravaganza,
"Cleopatra Up-to-Date."

Nevertheless yesterday and last night
saw the room crowded with camera
folk and brush artists, who are a unit
in ranking- the show of unusually high
class.
Under the title of the "First Ameri

and women from New York, Washing

SHAFT HURLS
MAN TO DEATH
Joseph Campbell, a machinist's help
er, met a horrible death yesterday In a
machine shop at Sixth and Folsom
streets. His foot was caught in a re
volving shaft, which whirled him
around. His skull was fractured by
striking a post. The injured man was
removed to the Central Emergency
Hospital, but he died shortly afterward.
About quitting time Campbell went
to finish a task near the revolving
Bhaft. In some unaccountable manner
his trousers were caught in the shaft,
and in an instant he was circling
through the air, his head striking a
post at every revolution. Another em
ploye of the shop ran to the man's as
sistance and stopped the machinery.
When released he was unconscious.
Campbell lived at Eighth and Natoma
streets and had a wife and two chil
dren.

JEWELRY BURGLARS
ON THE WAY HITHER
Detectives Arrest Two Bold Swindlers
In the Indian Terri
tory.
Detective O'Day returned from
Okmulgee, I. T., yesterday, having Jo
seph and Henry Martin In custody,
they being: charged with the burglary
of L. Cook's Jewelry store at 1712 Mar
ket street.
Joseph Martin was employed as a
regular salesman in the store, and
Henry worked on commission. On Au
gust 8, 1904, they left, taking $1100
worth of Jewelry. Not thinking that
they had robbed their former employer
sufficiently, Henry Martin returned the
second time and, using a key which
he had retained, gained an entrance,
taking about $5000 worth of Jewelry
Descriptions of the two man were
sent broadcast over the United States
resulting in the location of the Martin
brothers at Okmulgee, I. T. Detec
tives O'Day and Mulcahy were de
tailed to bring the prisoners back to
California. They left Okmulgee on
April 6, passing through Kansas City
on the return, where Mulcahy devel
oped a severe case of erysipelas. His

DEATH ENDS
CAREER OF
GATES BOYS
Two of Copley Train Rob
bers Are Cornered by a
Sheriff's Posse in a New
Mexico Town and Killed
DETECTIVE THACKER
IDENTIFIES BODIES
Long Pursuit of Murderers
of 3fessenger W. J. O'Neil
Closes in a Tragic Manner
on the Southern Frontier
George and Vernon Gates, the Cop
ley train robbers, whom the Southern
Pacific and Wells-Fargo detectives
have been eagerly looking for eevr
since the commission of the robbery on
March 31 of last year, have paid the
penalty of their many offenses and
now He burled in unmarked graves on
the outskirts of Lordsburg, N. M. This
Information was received yesterday by
John F. Seymour, chief of Wells, Fargo
& Co.'s secret agents, from Detective
J. N. Thacker, who is now in Lords
burg, whither he started a week ago
last Saturday on receipt of Information
that the Gates brothers were in that lo
cality. Thacker had hardly arrived In
New Mexico when two men, who have
since been identified as the Gates
brothers, were shot by a Sheriff's posse.
According to the message received by
Captain Seymour two men held up a
saloon in Lordsburg on March 15 and
with their loot hurried off to the moun
tains. Sheriff McGrath of Lordsburg
immediately organized a posse and
started In pursuit. After a hot chase
the posse overtook the robbers at the
town of Separ and when the two men
showed resistance they were killed. The
youthful appearance of the dead men
caused the authorities of Lordsburg to
institute an investigation with a view
of discovering their identity, which, it
is said was finally effected through
photographs of the Gates brothers then
in the possession of one of the South
ern Pacific representatives of the Pink
erton Detective Agency of Chicago.
THACKER IDENTIFIES BODIES.
Learning that Detective Thacker was
scouting along the southern border In
search of George and Vernon Gates, the
authorities of Lordsburg communicated
with him, and arriving at Lordsburg
the San Franciscan promptly complet
ed the work of identification. Thack
er's message to Captain Seymour reads
as follows:
LORDSBURG }T. Mex.. April 10. â Captain
Seymour Special W. F. â Just returned from
Parral. Mexico. I find that George. Gates and
Vernon Gates held up a saloon In Lordsburg,
N. Mex.. on the 15th of March and were fol
lowed to &epar, N. Mex., by McGrath and
posse and were killed while resisting arrest.
They recovered the eix-shooters ajid all the
money that was taken from the saloon. Bodies
were brought back here to Lordsburg and
buried. There Is no question as to the identity
of the men, so you can notify the father, who
Hve3 In Alameda, Cal., and I will send In
photographs as soon ac I can get them. I am
thowughly satisfied because I have seen some
of the proofs George has gunshot wounds as
described In circular. J. N. THACKER.
Captain Seymour said last night that
he was fully satisfied that the men
killed at Separ were George and Ver
non Gates. Several weeks ago the ex
press company was advised that the
Gates boys had been seen in New
Mexico, apparently making for the
border, and Detective Thacker, who
was familiar with all the incidents of
the Copley robbery, immediately start
ed south with the idea of heading the
robbers off and capturing them. It
was Thacker's plan of intercepting the
men before they could reach Mexico
that accounts for the detective's -pres
ence In Parral, from which jlace he
was summoned to Lordsburg.
DARING AFFAIR RECALLED.
The Copley robbery was a daring af
fair that cost Express Messenger W. J.
O'Neil his life and brought nothing to
the robbers in the way of booty. On
the night of March 31, 1904, the south
bound Oregon express was held up at
Copley, Shasta County, by three men.
When they called upon Messenger
O'Neil to open the door of his car he
refused. The robbers then forced a
brakeman to ran on the door and when
O'Neil opened it a little way and
showed himself he was shot dead.
Then the robbers entered the car and.
placing a package of dynamite on top
of the express safe, retreated a dis
tance and touched the explosive off.
Unfortunately for their plan, however,
the main part of the safe, in which was
stored much coin, was not destroyed
by the explosion. Consequently the
robbers got nothing for their daring
but murderous work. Realizing that
their time was precious the robbers cut
off from the train the first locomotive,
and boarding it ordered the engineer
to convey them to a point near Kes
wlck, where they alighted and disap
peared in the darkness of the night.
The next seen of the robbers was four
days later, while they were making
their way northward, and the fact that
they had formerly lived in Amador
County and were acquainted with min
ing caused the detectives to believe
that the men were heading for the
extreme northern part of the State.
THIRD MAN STIJLL MISSING.
Their identity waa not discovered by
the detectives until a month later,
when Patrick Crowley, then chief of
the secret agents' bureau of the South
ern Pacific, learned, through inter
cepted letters addressed to a woman
in Shasta County, that George Gates
was the leader of the trio of robbers.
Later it was learned that his brother
was with him on the night of the hold
up and that the third man waa James
Arnet, who had also been engaged in
mining in Northern California, and like
the Gates boys, had been suspected of
many crimes, but had eluded arrest
and conviction through the failure of
his victims to properly identify him.
Rewards were offered for the arrest
of the trio and their photographs were
scattered broadcast, but from the night
of April 5, 1904, up to several weeks
ago, when the express authorities re
ceived a tip that the Gates boys were
in New Mexico, heading for old Mex
ico, nothing definite had been heard of
the robbers.
George Gates was 26 years of age
and his brother Vernon 22. They were
the -sons of a well-to-do mining man
G. G. Gates, living with his daughter
in Alameda, but at present visiting his
old home in Amador County. The
father endeavored in every way to in
duce his wayward sons to reform, but
he had no influence over George and
the latter influenced Vernon The
whereabouts of Arnet is unknown to
the detectives, who believe that he
separated from the Gates boys in this
Slate and is now somewhere in th<Â»
Northwest.

ALLEGES BIAS
AND PREJUDICE
Frank A. Maestretti Begins
His Preliminary Skirmish
Against Going to Trial
GRAND JURORS APPEAR
While William V. Bryan, Sec
retary, Is Being Examined
Continuance Is Ordered
The grand jurors gathered in Judge !
Lawlor's courtroom yesterday after- 1
noon to give their testimony on the
motion of Frank A. Maestretti. presi
dent of the Board of Works, to set !
aside the indictment charging him
with fraudulently attempting to in
duce a person to give false testimony.
The hour was late when the case was
called, and while William V. Bryan,
secretary of the Grand Jury, was be
ing examined a continuance was or
dered till Saturday morning at 10:30
o clock. The defendant sat between
his attorneys, ex-Governor Budd and ;
Henry C. Dibble, during the proceed
ings.
When Bryan took the stand Budd
announced that the defense desired to i
show that there existed in the minds
of the grand jurors bias and preju- i
dice against the defendant to such an
extent as to affect his substantial
rights. He referred particularly to a
committee appointed by the Grand
Jury, which examined persons outside
the sessions of that body prior to the
filing of the indictment.
Assistant District Attorney Ferral
thought it would be killing time to go
Into such an inquiry at that time, to
which both Budd and Dibble hotly
retorted that they were not killing
time and that the defendant was anx
ious to proceed to trial, but at the
same time he would insist upon his
rights. "We claim," said Budd, "that
there was a combination by and be
tween a majority of the Grand Jury
and a committee of that body where
by any person the committee might
recommend for indictment would be
Indicted."
In answer to questions, most of
which were objected to on the ground
of privilege, Bryan said there was no
record of the appointment of a com
mittee. The committee was appointed
by Foreman Andrews in accordance
with what he was advised was the
law on the subject. No report had
been received from the committee as
to indicting the defendant. Fourteen
members had been present when the
indictment was under consideration.
On the day the indictment was filed
District Attorney Bylngton had told
the jury that he had a case against
Frank A. Maestretti. Then a recess
was taken and Judge Lawlor was
summoned. He instructed the jurors
as to their duties and Informed them
that jurors should not vote on an in
dictment if there existed in their
minds any bias or prejudice against
the person to be indicted. No name
was mentioned, but simply "a case
pending." Then, in open court Fore
man Andrews and Jurors Bowes and
Speck said they were disqualified.
They were excused by the Judge. It
was at this point that a continuance
was ordered till Saturday morning.
