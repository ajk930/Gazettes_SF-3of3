Before he could utter a cry Herbert
was seizedby a score of hands and his

as an effective blindfold and gag. -The

He struggled to his -feet andTnanaged

strength to stagger a few feet away

The animal tore the ring through Its

again, but was too weak to even make
an attempt to crawl through the fence.

GALE HURLS
TRAIN FROM
THE TRACK
There are circumstances attending
the case which are more mysterious
even than the threats which have been
made. "A mysterious woman' in black
has called at the Byington mansion and
warned the servants that two men are
about to steal the child and that if
they knew the warning had been de
livered her life would t>e the forfeit.
Shingles bearing the single word "Be
ware" have been found in various parts
of the grounds.
Only a short time ago. while the
nurse was on the lawn with the child,
a man concealed behind a dense hedge
threw a stone at the nurse. It struck
her on the arm and almost fractured
it. it struck her head she would
have been killed and the child left
unprotected long enough for the vil
lain to have carried the little one away.
There is more than a suspicion that
the threatened kidnaping does not havÂ«
for its object an effort to secure blood
money from Byington. He Is well able
to pay a fortune were such payment
necessary, but there seems to be more
behind the case than money matters.
Next to his desire to protect his
child from harm Byington's greatest
wish Is to prevent the publication of
the story. Although he has told a
number of persons of his fears for the
safety of his child, among them the
Mayor and Chief of Police of Pasadena,
to his next door neighbors, the child's
school teacher and others, he stated
positively this evening that if the story
is published he will deny It.
Some time ago Byington related to
a close friend of his incidents of what
appeared to be a bold plot to kidnap
his daughter. Chloe. It seems that a
mysterious woman, dressed in black
and wearing a heavy black veil, had
called at the Byington home during
the absence of Mr. and Mrs. Byington
and engaged Chloe's nurse maid in
earnest , conversation, warning the
servant that a plot by two men was
afoot to steal Chloe Byington. By
ington stated also that he had received
anonymous letters of a threatening
character, and had found shingles lying
on his lawn, on which had been
scrawled the word "Beware."
Upon the advice of this friend Bying
ton had a consultation with Chief o?
Police Freeman. The chief advised the
worried father that as San Pasqual
street is outside the Pasadena city
limits he could not lend the assistance
of the department, and suggested that
a private detective be employed. This
suggestion was heeded and a sleuth in
the guise of an ordinary gardener took
up temporary residence at the Bying
ton home. â¢
The blue-eyed child was closely
guarded from harm. She is never al
lowed away from the hoifse unless ac
companied by her father, her mother
or the nurse maid.
Some days ago little Chloe. wearing
her play-ground dress of bloomers and
blouse, was enjoying* some childish
frolic In the grounds at the rear of
her parents' home. Suddenly the nurse,
who was near by, uttered a cry of
fright and pain. Catching up Chloe
in her arms, she rushed into the house,
where to the child's alarmed mother
she exhibited a badly bruised hand. A
man from the screen of hedge had
hurled a large stone with cruel aim
and effect Who the cowardly assail
ant was or why the missile vas hurled
a quick examination of the premises
gave no clew. The matter was report
ed to the police at the time of the
strange occurrence.
Chief of Police Freeman of Pasadena
refused to discuss the matter, but he
called Byington up and asked him
whether he desired to make a state
ment. Byington's reply was to the ef
fect that his chief anxiety was to keep
the matter out of the papers.
The Byington family Is one of . the
best known in Pasadena and has
wealthy relatives in various ports of
the country. Mrs. Byington is a niece
of the late Senator Leland Stanford.

plan for a settlement of the Northern
Securities litigation, "the Hill-Harri

broad in its sweep as to take in prop

â¢A Mam-ion House wedding is always
a swell affair and great preparations
had beerv made for this one. Three
hundred guests had been invited and
more than 300 presents had been re
vived. The Court of Aldermen sent a
handsome diamond necklace and the
Court of Common Council a pair of
d:araond earrings, table silx-cr and cut-
Ifry Many costly gifts from arlsto
Â« ratfc friends figure in the list. All the
present* have been returns. Miss
Ritchie is left with her bridal trous-
M-au on her hands. She will not have
lor* to wait for an opportunity to
make u*e of it if she Is minded to seek
*r.lace for her disappointment in a sec
ond engagement. There are scores o '
eligible young men in London who
vould Jump at the chance to tike the
recalcitrant McCalman's place ' vnd
would clve bonds to appear at the
altar.
Little Is known of McCalman or his
antecedents in I/ondon. For some
years he ha* held a good position in
the Egyptian Irrigation service. He is
about 30 years of age and good look-
Ing. He was regarded as a very lucky
man in winning Miss Ritchie, for Sir
Jnmes has lots of money and can be
depended on to make a handsome set
tlement on his daughter. Only wealthy
men are eligible for election to the
ornamental dignity of Lord Mayor of
London. The salary is 550.000 a year,
but the Incumbent is expected to spend
tv.lce or thrice that sum on entertain
ing the city's guests and is invariably
rewarded with knighthood during his
tmunp of office if he does not happen
to possess a title before he takes it.
Miss Ritchie and her lover had gone
chopping together the day before.
Every man knows what a trying ordeal
thst is â for a man. It has been sug
gested that It was this experience
which caused McCalman to realize
what matrimonial fetters meant and to
resolve to seek freedom in flight.
McCalman adopted a more discreet
method of conveying the tidings of his
hymeneal renunciation to the bride's
family, perhaps because he feared the
possible consequences of an encounter
with Miss Ritchie's big brother. Just
bÂ«(oroJiÂ« RkiPDed !]P muiled a. J*Â»ttÂ«r ti>
cÂ»r Jarneh. telling him that he had de
Â«Idtd not to marry his daughter. He
had been expected tcÂ» take lunch that
day m the Mansion House, the stately
official residence of the Lord Mayor,
but to the surprise of the household
he did not come, nor was any message
received from him to account for his
absence.
"He must have b^en unavoidably de
tained somewhere," said Miss Ritchie,
Â¦who had not the slightest suspicion
that anything was wrong. "He will
certainly be her* to dinner in the even
ing," she added cheeri'y. While she
uas speaking, her lover was speeding
away from London as fast as a rail
way train could carry him. The din
tier hour came and the rich wedding
gifts were displayed about the room,
but the bridegroom did not show up.
Just as the family had taken their
Eeats at the table McCalman's letter
arrived. In a few moments Miss
Ritchie had fled weeping from the fes
tive board to her bedroom. Bir James
was choking with anger and indigna
tion and tho big brother was fervently
wishing that he had McCalman's head
In chancery.
"The blow came like a bolt from
the blue," he said. "We have not the
remotest idf-a what has led McCalman
to act as he has done. We neither
know his reasons nor his whereabouts.
There was certainly nothng in the na
ture of a quarrel betwen him and my
sister. They appeared to be the hap
piest pair imaginable."
GO SHOPPING TOGETHER.
ITL\RS GIRL'S BIG BROTHER.
I^ONDON, Sept. 28.â It Is probable
that the true reasons which caused J.
A- C. McCalman to desert his bride
elect. Miss Constance Ritchie, the sec
ond daughter of Sir James Ritchie,
Lord Mayor of London, two days be
fore the day assigned for the wedding
will never be divulged. No light is
thrown on his motives for jilting the
girl in the latest details that have been
gleaned about the affair. He has dis
appeared, leaving: no address behind
him. but is supposed to be making him
self scarce on the Continent. For some
time to cume he will certainly find Lon
don too hot to hoM him. Miss Ritchie,
meanwhile, is doing: h^r best to console
herself with the reflection that she has
had a narrow escape from a marriage
that would have proved a failure, but
docs not find it so easy as some of her
philosophic friends who have under
taken to comfort her. There will be no
breach of crornise suit and no recon
ciliation. "McCalman may change his
mind," says Miss Ritchie's brother,
"but my sister will never change hers.
She has done with him forever and we
thai! assist her to forget the past as
quickly and completely as it is hu
manly possible."
One of the most singular features of
th* case is the extraordinary pains
taken by the faithless lover to give
publicity to his own perfidy. He called
personally at the prominent newspaper
offices before his flight and announced
"his intention of dodging the matri
monial noose. But with that singular
lark of appreciation of opportunities to
obtain news which is characteristic of
British Journalists he was not asked to
give any explanation. Nor was any
gratitude shown him for his valuable
"tip" in the comments made on his
conduct.

that the conscription law will be
amended by increasing the reserve
service to five years, thus making the

Committee Is Appointed at Eucharistlc
Congress to Express Disapproval
of Attitude to Rome. '-,.'â¢
NEW YORK, Sept.~ 28.â At the
Eucharistio Congress, to-day Bishop
Maes appointed a committee to draw
up resolutions denouncing the French
Government for its action toward the
Catholic orders in that country.
Father Dougherty asked that copies
of the resolutions be ordered sent to
the President of the United States and
the Governor of the State of New
York. When this suggestion was made
Archbishop Farley said: ' : :-'$****Â£'"'Â£
"1 think that would be going too far
and mingling up things. - The Catholic
church does not belong to the presi
dent of the United States or the.Gov
ernor of the State of New-York. It

WASHINGTON, Sept. 28. â Two at
tempts have been made to wreck the
battleship Connecticut, which is to be
launched at the Brooklyn navy yard
to-morrow. The announcement of the
discovery of a.n obstruction hidden on
the ways beneath the water .brought
forth the story of the previous at
tempt to injure the Connecticut.
Three weeks ago Admiral Rogers
reported to the N"avy Department. that
serious, weakness was discovered in
the. ways. A careful investigation fol
lowed and this showed that defects In
construction were doubtless planned
for the purpose of bringing the great
battleship to disaster when It started
into the water. Great secrecy was
maintained about the: weakness in the
ways, but at that time naval officers
gave the subject much thought and a
special guard was established to pro
tect the ship from damage. All ef
forts to â locate the responsibility for
the defect were futile.
NOT THE FIRST ATTEMPT
TO DAMAGE BATTLESHIP
When she noticed the captain ap
proaching she ran to the kitchen, pro
cured a large meat fork and tried to
stab him. She succeeded in striking
him in the side, but as Swan had on
a heavy coat the weapon did not pene
trate far enough to hurt him. Had he
been coatless, however, he would have
received a serious wound.

Is serving ten years for picking pockets

SAN RAFAEL, Sept.^ 2S.â Captain
Swan,- acting captain of the yard at
San Quentin, had a fierce fight with
Belle Nailer, a colored. woman prisoner,

ROME, Sept. 28. â Although a por
tion of the Italian press insists that
the meeting of Premier Gioletti and
Count von Bulow, the German Chan
cellor, at Hoaiburg was connected
with the subject of mediation, between
Russia and Japan, the Capitale, a
semi-official organ, gives voice to the
contrary view, and says:
"Not only the Italian, but all Eu
ropean governments consider that
mediation Is Impossible now, when
Russia fully trusts in her ability to
turn tfle tide of battle in her favor and
while Japan does not wish to lose the
fruits .of her victories."
The 'Avanti asserts that the presence
of' Prince Charles of Hohenzollern at
Tokio has a connection with alleged
plans of mediation. The Foreign Of

that Italy is concerned in any such
movement.

Lafcadio Hearn was born June 27,
1850, at Santa Naura In the Ionian
Island3. His father was an English
man, and his mother a native Greek.
He was educated In England, and
after leaving college came to this coun
try and engaged in journalism in Cin
cinnati and New Orleans. His first long
story was "Chita; A Memory of Lost
Island."
He published "Two Years in the West
Indies" in 1890, and went to Japan,
where he lived until his death. He
taught In Japan's colleges, and his
stories of Japanese life show marvel
ous comprehension of and sympathy
with Oriental philosophy.
In Japan he traveled extensively, vis
iting many remote parts of the island
kingdom.
He there wrote and published "Out
of the East" (1894). "Glimpses of Un
familiar Japan" (1895) and "Kokovo"
(1896). He possessed rare literary
power, and won a high place in the
literature of his day.
YOKOHAMA. Sept. 28. â Lafcadio
Hearn. the well-known author, died at
Tokio on September 26, of heart trouble.
His funeratl will take place on Septem
ber SO. General regret is expressed
among the Japanese at the death of
Hearn.
TOLSTOI'S SOX WARLIKE.
lk'iieves Russia Is I>estined to Con

FT. PETERSBURG. Sept. 28. â
Count Tolstoi's son, Leo. in an article
in the Novoe Vremya. takes a position
diametrically opposed to his father's;.
He has just returned from seeing hi?
brother, who is departing for the
front, and writes of the touching
scenes he witnessed at Tamboff as the
reserves left for the Far East. Never
theless, young Tolstoi says, the peas
ants are all united in agreeing that
the war must be fought out until
Japan is subdued. He adds:
It is a hard time for Russia, but it is the
PTioa of her receneraticn. The war in the
Kar EÂ«*=t if= a ciÂ«a.t war. such an Russia has

Poltava. We axe now suffering reverses with
the Asiatic FÂ»Â«lef. but there will come a day

In concluding, young Tolstoi pre
dicts the triumph of Russia, which,
h^ declares-, "is destined to become,
instead of England,' the greatest na
tion in the world."
He Fays the Slavs will spread over
and absorb all the neighboring peoples
they have already subjugated, in the

Japan to Float Another Loan.
TOKIO, Sept. 28. â The Government
has decided to float another domsetic
loan of 80,000,000 yen, on conditions
similar to those which governed the
last loan, the price to be "92.05 per
cent. The present prosperous condi

HONOLULU, Sept. 28.â S. E. Da
mon, a member of a prominent local
family, and connected in a business
way with a local banking firm, was
murdered by a Porto Rican named Jose
Miranda last night. Damon was driv
ing home, . and when near Maunaloa
met three Porto Ricans, one of whom
was a woman. One of the men took
Damon's lantern, and, when he remon
strated, stabbed him in the abdomen.
Damon drove on to Honolulu, but died
before reaching a hospital.
The deceased was 30 years of age,
and left a wife and four children, one
of whom is dying of meningitis, and
may not live until to-morrow. His
mother is now in London, and his
father is â¢ prominent here as a banker
and financier,
Miranda and his companions have
been arrested, and the woman has
practically made a confession. Public
feeling over the crime is intense.
There was a general suspension of
business here to-day as a tribute to
the memory of Damon.
Miranda was this morning indicted
for murder by the Grand Jury, and
subsequently arraigned before Judge
Gear. .

Details of the fighting near Inpu, be

on September 26, show that General
Mistchenko's scouts, accompanied by a

Henry Lachman is still busy with

of foreign . countries. , Awards .may, be
announced any. .day.^ -.'>Â¦>.-
France ma,kes the contention,, and
Tshe has stood by it strongly at succes
sive world's fairs, that all names of
districts within her borders under
which any wine has become famous
belong to her and that their use by any
other nation is fraud and an Infringe
ment on the rights Â»f her wine pro
ducers. Medoc, St. Julien, Champagne,
Sauterne and Burgundy are merely the
names of sections of France where
wines of different flavors are produced.
France secured the usual ruling at
the St. Louis fair that any wine or
grape of one country bearing the name
of any section of another should not be
eligible for entry in competition. The
usual commotion was produced. Ger
man champagne, so labeled, and Cali
fornia grape brandy, bearing the word
"cognac," also a distrct in France, were
ruled outâ the cognac with the under
standing that it would be considered
if the owners consented to the agree
ment entered into in connection with
tfee compromise. This agreement is
that in future any California wine pro
ducer who wishes to make use of the
name of a French district shall state
on the label that his wine is a "type"
of that produced in the district named
and that California shall appear promi
nently in the label, so there will be no
fraud or deception possible. It is the
flame regarding cognac.
The wine of the champagne type
made in California was not interdicted,
as it does not bear the name "cham
pagne," only "extra dry" being used.
In some cases the California growers
use the name of the grape as a base
for that of their wine. This is distinc
tive and within the rule.
CALL BUREAU, PRESS BUILD
ING, WORLD'S FAIR, ST. LOUIS,
Sept. 28.â The wrangle at the St. Louis
Exposition over the admission before
the international jury of awards for
prize competition of California Â¦ wines
bearing the names of French districts,
and the compromise thereon, with Its
accompanying agreement, may inau
gurate something of a new era in the
wine industry of the State and Cut an
important and beneficial ligure in its
future. It may lead to a gradual but
complete abandonment of the French
names, and the .substitution of other3
purely Californian, which shall become
as famous as those so highly treasured
by France. There is no reason why, if
the wines produced in them are kept at
a high standard, the names of. wine
producing sections of California should
not stand for as much those of France.
The Westminster Gazette commends
the attitude of the American press in
the Gurney matter as "showing its
good sense."
WASHINGTON, Sept. 28.â "If inves
tigation shows that Hugh Gurney,
third secretary of the British Embassy,
who was arrested for speeding his au
tomobile in Massachusetts, has been in
the habit of breaking the State speed
laws, it is not unlikely that the Brit
ish Embassador will be given an inti
mation that the young secretary might
better be sent away from the United
States," said a prominent State De
partment official this afternoon.
"Of course, it is possible that Mr.
Gurney was exceeding the speed limit
unconsciously. It is very easy to do
that with an automobile," the official
continued, "but if the reports that he
has been a chronic violator of the
speed limits are corroborated, his use
fulness in Washington will doubtless
be regarded as Impaired and a hint to
that effect will be given."
LONDON, Sept. 28.â The Westminster
Gazette this afternoon accurately sums
up the official opinion of the incident
resulting from the fining by Justice
Phelps of Lee, Mass., of Hugh Gurney,
third secretary of the British embassy
at Washington, for alleged violation
of the law relating to automobiles and
for contempt of court, saying:
"It seems desirable that gentlemen
connected with the legations should
keep on the safe side of local law when
they use motor cars, but, if perchance
they transgress, the simplest, quietest
way is.-perhaps, to waive their privi
lege and pay the fine."
No little annoyance is exhibited in
official quarters here at tne claim made
by Gurney for diplomatic exemption,
with the consequent publicity over a
trifling affair. It is recalled, however,
that when the son of Henry White,
secretary of the embassy in London,
and Spencer Eddy, in 1S99. when he
was third secretary of the embassy,
were summoned here for riding bicycles
on a footpath, similar exemption was
claimed and reference was then made
to the statute of 1708. whereby any
British official acting as Justice Phelps
did toward a diplomat became amen
able not only to severe penalties, but
even to flogging.

Staff Correspondence of The Call.
ST. LOUIS, Sept. 28.â TneodcTe Steg
man, -13 years old. who says he once
owned California property worth |3D.
000,000. but who is now a prisoner in a
St. Louis jail because of his inability
to furnish a bond for a trivial amount,
appeared to-day in Judge Adams* pri
vate c-ffice in the Federal building and
complained of the treatment accorded
him in jail. Judge Adams, it is re
ported, promised to investigate Steg
man's charges. Stegman haa been In
Jail since the latter part of July. He
was president of the Missouri Rental
Company and was arrested on charges
In both Federal and State courts. The
Federal charge Is using th< mails to
defraud and the State charge Is obtain
ing money under false pretenses. J.
C. Hailer, his attorney, says the
charges are based on the selling of cer
tain properties to which' it is alleged
he had no title. When the cases are
called for trial, he says, it will be
shown there was no criminal tgtent.
"At one time I was in possession of
property worth many million dollars."
said Stegman. "This property was in
Southern California and consisted of
irrigation bonds. I was well known by
landholdera and bankers. On this
property 1 borrowed J16.000.000. If t
had been a fool I guess I could not
have done that. And if I had not been
an honest man I would never have at
tained the place I held. I paid all but
J4.000.000 of that J16.000.000 and I failed
in Kansas City In 1833 for that amount.
I was forced into bankruptcy when t
was in a prosperous condition. But two
men swore I was bankrupt. There was
some interest money due which I failed

It is reported that General Kuropat

to make up the heavy losses in killed
and wounded in the battle of Liaoyang.
ST. PETERSBURG, Sept. 29, 3 a. m.
âMovements at ihe front, so far as
disclosed by the meager dispatches re
ceived here, are confined almost entire
ly to continuous outpost skirmishes, by
means of which General Kuropatkin
is. keeping in close touch with the Jap
anese along the whole of their front.
Field Marshal Oyama's advfLnce ap
pears to be extremely deliberate. There
are.no indications a* yet that he has
begun to overlap the Russian positions.
The superiority of the Russian caval
ry is beginning to be apparent. They
have had the better of it in a number
of minor encounters. It appears that
General Rennenkampff's movement to
the southward on September 19 extend
ed beyond the distance indicated by
lirst reports. His Cossacks made a rap-
JJ sweep on September 22 and struck a
Japanese force at Bensihu, threatening
its communication and causing much
excitement.

He adds that the Russians at
tempted to bury the dead of both sides
at night, because the decomposing
bodies seriously menace the health of
the garrison. The Russians allege that
It is the deliberate policy of the Jap
anese to undermine the health of the
Russian troops by means of the odors
from the decomposing bodies and that
fcr this reason they fire on the burial
parties.
One Chinese who was a member of
a burial party says that the Japanese
fired when he and other Chinese at
tempted to bury the dead. He adds
that when the wind carries the odors
toward the Japanese the latter retire.
Chinese say that the most severe at
tacks were made on the supplementary
forts of the Itz and Anshu Mountain
fcrts. The Russians had undermined
the ground and several hundred Jap
anese were blown up on September
23. Reports received from the Miao
tao Islands mention a terrific 1 report
Y.-hich shook the houses there on that
date.
The Russian ships, it is reported,
took no part in the battle.
From thirty to fifty shells fall daily

ST. PETERSBURG, Sept. 28.âGener
al Stoessel has finally refused to yield
Port Arthur, as all expected he would.
A friend of his said to-day:
"Even if instructions were sent to
him to capitulate he would surely fol
low the example of Nelson, who
promptly turned blind on the side of
the signal telling him to cease fight
ing."
Russia is now following developments
with keen anxiety. It is fully recog
nized that the situation at Port Arthur
is rapidly becoming desperate. When
the moment arrives that the ships are
forced to leave the harbor the water
question will become doubly serious,
as their condensers will no longer be
available. The supplies of munitions
and coal, in spite of denials, are run
ning short. No illusions v are held here
as to the widely serious effect the fall
oÂ£ Port Arthur will have.
CHEFU, Sept. 28. â Russians resid
ing here claim to have received infor
mation that the. Japanese losses in the
last assault on Port.Arthur (which be
gan on September 19) were 7000. A
Chinese who left the fortress on Sep
ttmber 26 says that the Russian losses
were between 500 and 600.
This Chinese says that the Japanese
were \ unable to remain in the three
supplementary forts which they cap
tured and that they retired at 4 o'clock
on the afternoon of September 26, after
enduring several days of tremendous
firing from the inner forts.

ST. PETERSBURG, Sept. 28.â The

Arthur is not reassuring. The block
ade at last seems to be effective. Ad
miral Togo's ships are* arresting all
the junks which try to enter the har

VANCOUVER, B. C, Sept. 28.â
The mechanical strike on the Cana

over. An agreement between the
company and the machinists and
blacksmiths has been reached on a
basis of a substantial increase for
these branches. The. amount of. the
advance in wages has not been def
initely stated, but it is understood to
be 1 cent per hour.
Vancouver Strike Settled.
Every infant striker wore a badge
to show that he or she belonged to a
"union." Some of the badges were
merely scraps of paper with the word
"union" scrawled across it. Others
wore union buttons which their fath
ers had worn. Many of the strikers
carried clubs. They threatened vio
lence against any child daring to en
ter the school yard.
After a detail of six policemen had
been sent to the school to preserve
order the "strike" was "settled." A
committee appointed by the youthful
"strikers" learned that the rumor of
a colored teacher having been em
ployed in the kindergarten class of
the school was false. About 80 per
cent of the strikers "went back to
their classes. Truant officers began
a search for the absentees.
Outside the picket cordon a crowd
of 700 boys and girls hooted and
yelled at the teachers looking from
the school windows. .

IX OREGON DIGGINGS
SAUSALITO, Sept. 28.â The' residents
of Sausalito voted to-day to issue bonds
to the amount of $30,000 for the pur
pose of constructing two modern school
houses and procuring necessary furni
ture. Great interest was taken in the
election, as Sausalito has grown rap
idly In the last few years and has felt
the need of greater school accommoda
tions. The result of the election was
238 votes for the bonds and 42 against.
The election was called by the Board
of Trustees of the Sausalito school dis
trict. Town Trustee W. J. Martin,
Father . Valentine,"-' Mayor Thomas I and
other public-spirited citizens led the
fight for the bonds, and It was due to
their efforts that the proposition was
carried by almost a unanimous vote.
Sausalito is sadly in need of better
educational facilities at present. The
classrooms are crowded and a vote
against the. issue of the bonds, would
have been detrimental, to the town.
The prison record shows that Stroh
is a second termer, now serving twen
ty years for burglary. For some time
he has been suspected by the prison
officials of trafficking in drugs. Their
surpicions 'were confirmed when they
found upon him a vial of morphine.
Stroh refused to tell where he pro
cured it and was put in the strait
jacket.
SAX RAFAEL. Sept. 28. â Convict
fAdÂ£m Stroh. about whom so much
has been published the last few days
in a San Francisco daily, whose pun
ishment by the Warden of San Quen
tin is fhe cause of a threatened inves
tigation by the State Board of Prison
Directors, was interviewed by a Call
representative to-day. The reporter
called upon the Warden this after
noon and requested information con
cerning the charges of cruelty and in
human treatment of prisoners made
against the prison in the same daily.
The Warden was very frank in his
statements concerning the disciplinary
measures he had taken to suppress
the opium traffic. He stated that he
is perfectly willing to have his actions
in this respect fully investigated and
felt that the result would prove to
the public the justness of his action?.
When asked if Convict Stroh was in
a paralyzed condition from his ex
perience in the strait jacket the War
den replied that Stroh himself could
best answer that question and or
dered Captain Swan to conduct The
Call representative to the incorrigible
cell in which the prisoner is confined.
Stroh is one of the seven who are suf
fering solitary confinement in the iron
cells on the floor of the old factory
building of the great penitentiary.
The door of Stroh's cell was opened
and out of the darkness stepped the
convict. He walked a distance of
twenty feet to where the reporter was
Ftanding and showed no signs of loss
of power in any part of his body. His
carriage was erect and free and he
looked anything but a paralytic. When
introduced to the reporter he smiling
ly shook hands and then very freely
answered the questions put to him.
He stated that he had been in the
strait jacket on and off for about 120
hours. When asked how he felt he
said:
Â¦ Oh, pretty good."
He denied that he was carried from
ihÂ» straitjacket to his cell.
â¢ Why." he laughingly said, "I
walked all the way up this big flight
of stairs and when we got to the top
Swan was puffing and I wasn't. Of
course I suffered in the jacket, but
without evil effects."
This ended the interview and Stroh
was again locked up in his solitary
ten.
Special Dispatch to The Call,
If Captain Hemphill claims the punch
bowl as his personal property and has
his name inscribed on it, it is regarded
here that he has either taken it from
the ship without due process or he has
violated the statute prohibiting the ac
ceptance of such a gift from a foreign
ruler, On either horn of the dilemma,
he may be liable to investigation and
discipline.
CALL BUREAU. HOTEL BARTON,
WASHINGTON, Sept. 28.â What Is
now known as the "punchbowl tem
pest," In which Captain Jacob H.
Hemphill figures as an Important fac
tor, has stirred the Navy Department
to amusement and no little concern. It
has been years since an incident of this
kind has created so much naval gossip.
Already an informal Investigation has
been quietly begun In the Navy De
partment and, although no protest has
been- filed, and no orders issued bear
ing on the case, the inquiry may take,
on a formal and official character.
Captain Hemphill will have to explain
why he took from the battleship Kear
sarge the punchbowl presented to that
vessel by the German Emperor.
Assistant Secretary Darling, acting
as secretary in the absence of Morton,
and Rear Admiral Converse, chief of
the Bureau of Navigation, both said
to-day that they knew of no record in
the Navy Department permitting Cap
tain Hemphill to accept a gift from -the
German Emperor. Both officials, how
ever, were loth to believe that Captain
Hemphill had committed -any irregu
larity, and it was suggested in the
office of the Assistant Secretary that
perhaps he had simply taken the Em
peror's gift ashore temporarily to ex
hibit it .to his friends. There was,
however, only one opinion at the de
partment in regard to an officer of the
navy accepting for himself such a gift,
and that was that it was unquestion
ably in violation of the statute bearing
on the case.

BERKELEY, Sept. 28. â California's
freshman football team got together
well to-day after playing two ragged
practice games and scored two touch
downs and a goal against .Lick on
Berkeley field, making the score 11
to 10.
In the first half the fresmen's
chances were materially ajded by a
run by Snowdon of twenty yards that
put the ball so close to the Lick goal
that it was no trouble to boost It over
in the next two downs. Richardson
failed to kick the goal.
Soon after the beginning of the sec
ond half the freshmen scored the sec
ond touchdown. Golcher made a

CALIFORNIA DEFEATS LICK.
W. H. O'Gara, a; youth whose parents
live at 960 Geary street in San Fran
cisco, took the stand to-day in Judge
Hall's court to testify in his own be
half, while seeking to clear himself of
the charge of perjury he now faces.
O'Gara is a bridegroom of a few
months' experience, who married Mary
E. Dunning, also of San Francisco,
when, according to her parents, the
girl was not yet eighteen years old.
O'Gara swore that she was of a mar
riagable age when he secured a license
in this city from Deputy County Clerk
Martin Hanley. From this circumstance
springs the charge of perjury.
Four years ago O'Gara was convicted
of a felony, the parents of a young
Alameda girl, Ella M. -Jessie, making a
serious charge against him. He served
in San Quentin a portion of the time
ordered by the court and was released
on parole. He met Miss Dunning in
San Francisco and their wedding fol
lowed despite parental objection. Four
weeks after the ,weddlng he was ar
rested and charged with perjury-
On the witness stand to-day he gave
his occupation as that of a musician.
He is 25 years old, smooth faced,
curly haired, chubby â a not unpleasing
youth in appearance and his story was
tbat s he loved the girl he married, did
not know she was under* age and had
none but praiseworthy motives when
he married her.
Argument of counsel was begun this
afternoon and the case will go to the
jury some time to-morrow morning.

SUIT AGAINST COUNTY
OAKLAND, Sept. 28.â Florence Ellis,
15 years old, was arrested and brought
back from her home at Wrights Sta
tion, Santa Cruz Mountains, to-night
by Detective George Kyte on a war
rant that charges the girl with stealing
a doll, worth $2, from the West Oak
land Home.
Grace L. Trevor, matron of the home,
swore to the complaint. Behind the
arrest is an effort, it is said, on the part
of the home authorities to have the girl
brought Within the Jurisdiction, of the
Juvenile Court. Mrs. Louise White
neck, the girl's mofBer, declares she
does not know why her daughter has
been arrested. The complaint was filed
September 3, but the warrant waa not
served until to-day, although, accord
ing to the mother, her daughter was
at the home until last Sunday. Flor
"e"nce left there then without notifying
the authorities.
She went to Wrights, where her
mother and sisters reside. The girl
and her mother insist : that the doll in
controversy was given to Florence by
a Mrs. Dunsmuir of Fruitvale. It "was
returned to the home people before the
girl's sudden departure, she claims.
The police have information that leads
them to believe that the girl is wanted
to explain concerning other missing
articles. She had been in the home for
two years, having been placed there
by her mother. Her father Is dead,
and the mother remarried recently, and
says she had intended to take the girl
out of the institution in a short time.
Police Judge Mortimer Smith made
some investigation to-night,- and al
lowed the girl to go with her mother,
who accompanied her daughter from
Wrights. The case will be heard to
morrow.

OAKLAND, Sept. 28. â Only fifteen
summers has Frank McGlaughlin
seen, but he is far enough advanced
on the path of the transgressor to be
held to answer on a charge of bur
glary. Justice Geary heard evidence
tending to convict the lad of burglary
to-day and ordered him bound over to
the Superior Court.
The youth confessed that his ambi
tion to go on a camping trip. inspired
his burglarious entrance into an Elm
hurst store, from which he took $15.
He needed the money to pay his share
of the expenses. The burglary was
committed on June 25. In his con
fession the youth involves Louis Cot
ter, also of Elmhurst, but his state
ments are contradictory and the of
ficials are not inclined to prosecute

The ladies in charge of to- day' a programme
had prepared a real treat for their guests, and
the three addresses were replete with good
things), interesting, instructive and witty.
Mrs. Caroline Olney, secretary of El Camino
Real Association, was the first speaker. Her
subject, "The Camino Real," was one full of
Interest for every thoroughgoing Californian
and to most it was a new story. The camino
real mean* the real road, a term designat
ing the wagon road, from the footpaths con
necting the early missions. The avowed pur
pose of the association is to establish a high
way from â¬an Diego to Slskiyou. which will
include the original Camino Real and to do
this x the co-operation of every taxpayer and
official in the State ia solicited. Not only the
building of this proposed highway, but "good
roads" Is the watchword of the association.
Mrs. Olney succeeded In arousing considerable
enthusiasm among her listeners, and without a
doubt the husband of every woman who was
there to-day had "good roads" for dinner to
night. At the close of Mrs. Olney's address,
lire. Bunnell, the club's president. In a neat
speech thanked her and reminded those pres
ent that Mrs. Olney was a charter member of
the Oakland Club and, in its infancy, actively
associated with its every interest.
Miss Josephine Hyde's little talk on Japan
was delightful, and she made it very evident
that we may learn much of practical art
from our trans-Pacific neighbors. Miss Hyde
suggested that attractive wayside tea-gardens
might be substituted, for the unsightly road
houses that now adorn our public highways.
The address by Mjbs Kate E. Whittaker
on "Domestic Science" was by no means as
dry as the title, her facile tongue and ready
wit holding the pleased attention of all.
OAKLAND, Sept. 28.â The ladies of the
Oakland Club will have a strong reason to be
thankful when the new Polytechnic College
building Is completed. The classes- are now
occupying the upper floor of. Maple Hall and
the noise of restless young feet and sliding
chairs is very audible in the club rooms be
low. It was a great relief to-day when the
last busy student forsook the temporary school
room, but by that time the speakers had fin
ished.

headed in an opposite direction to the

Loftus, according to Mrs. Gilligan,
prowled around the Madsen back
yard, and entered the house by a back
door. He used a-.skeleton key, which
he threw away in his flight, but it
was subsequently recovered. Mrs.
Madsen returned soon after the occur
rence and said she missed no prop
erty." There was considerable money
in the house.
Mrs. M. Gilligan, residing at 167
Seventh street, saw a burglar break
into the house at 165 Seventh street
of L. P. Madsen. a contractor, shortly
before noon to-day. Possessed of
presence of mind. Mrs. Gilligan,
knowing her neighbors were absent,
ran to a telephone and without an
outcry summoned the police. The
burglar saw the patrol wagon laden
with policemen approach in response
to Mrs. Gillijran's call. In the wagon
were Chief of Police Hodgkins, Police
men Agnew, Walters and Tobin.
There followed a hot pursuit, the
patrolmen separating in their chase
after the burglar, who ran toward the
estuary, crossing Seventh street and
making south on Madison street. At
Sixth street Policemen Agnew and
Walters sprang on the fugitive and
held him. At the City Prison the

After listening for four hours to ar
guments made by counsel in . the case
brought byC. E. Kinnard, to test the
the vaccination law of the State, Judge
H. A. Melvin, without hesitation, sus
tained the demurrer of the District At
torney, thus defeating the object
sought to be gained by the plaintiff.
The State law was practically on trial
in this action, it being generally under
stood that this test case would serve
as a precedent and rule for other com
munities in California. The Anti-Com
pulsory \ Vaccination League took part
in the proceedings, represented by At
torney J. R. Jones.
C. E. Kinnard, the plaintiff, is him
self a lawyer. His children, twin 1 girls,
17 years old, were refused admittance
to the Oakland high . school because
they had not complied with the vac
cination regulations. The test case fol
lowed, and to-day was decided upon
the demurrer.
Judge Melvin's decision, . sustaining
the demurrer, was given, the court
said, because the insufficiency of the
plaintiff's causes for complaint made
the demurrer a proper legal proced
ure. It was stated in the decision that
if Mr. V Kinnard desires to compel the
school authorities to admit his children
they must first be vaccinated, and then
mandamus proceeding will be in order,
but not before.

The Finance Committee of the City
Council to-night, after conference with
City Auditor A. H. Breed, recommend
ed that the tax levy for the current
fiscal year be fixed at $1 26, the same
as last year.
Auditor Breed's estimates fixed the
levy at $1 22, but the Council Commit
tee decided to add four cents to that
figure for park and boulevard purposes.
In addition to providing for the or
dinary expenses of maintenance of the
municipal departments the committee
makes allowances in the levy for $5000
for dredging at the city wharf, $6000
for a new fire engine house at Golden
Gate; $2500 for reconstruction of the
City Prison, to provide for proper quar
ters for female and juvenile prisoners;
SnOOO for fire apparatus at the Linda
Vista engine-house and an allowance
lor a new fire engine-house at Twelfth
and Union streets'; $18,000 for the com
pletion of the boulevard extension of
Harrison street from Twentieth to
Twenty-fourth streets; $2200 for ex
penses of the water rates suit in the
United States Circuit Court, and allow
ance for macadamizing streets around
Independence square.
The Auditor's provision for an in
crease of six men in the Police Depart
ment was cut out. The items in the
levy are $1 for maintenance, 11 cents
for high schools, 11 cents for bond in
terest and redemption, 4 cents for
parks and boulevards, total, $1 26.
The tax necessary to meet interest
charges on the $960,000 school bond
issue will be levied with the State and
county tax bills, as the bonds are a
lien against Oakland school district,
which includes property outside of the
corporate limits of the city. An ordi
nance covering the committee's recom
mendations will be offered at the Coun
cil meeting Monday night. The com
mittee had delayed actlorr* on the levy
pending the result of the bond election.

I The Supreme Court specifically says that
each proposition to carry must receive a two
thirds affirmative vote of the total vote cast.
If the total number of ballots cast is 6000,
each item to win must have received 4000 af
firmative votes, no matter what proportion of
votes Is cast on the item by itself. Suppose
the item of sewers received a vote as follows:
For. 3000: against. 1000. Notwithstanding
there is a two- thirds majority on this item, it
is not two- thirds of the total vote of 6000 and
therefore fails to carry.
Each item of proposed indebtedness was
computed according to the total vote cast at
the election, regardless of the fact that any
one proposition of itself might have received
a two- thirds affirmative vote.
Under the law. the general municipal im
provement act of 1001. each proposition sub
mitted to the people must be accepted by the
votes of two- thirds of all the voters voting at
the election to authorize .the issue of bonds.
In the case of the $17,000,000 bond issue in
San Francisco, recently decided by the Su
preme Court, it was held that each proposition
voted upon by the people of San Francisco
was required to have an afflmative vote of
two-thirds of all of the votes cast at the elec
tion.
The sewer proposition, which may
pull through, is' credited with having
received 4994 vote?. Against, it 'there
were 2234 votes cast. For the city
wharves improvements there were 4871
votes and in opposition 2247. ; ; f
City Attorney McElroy to-day ex
plained the law by which the City
Council will be guided In determining
which, if any, of the bond projects re
ceived a sufficient number of votes to
carry. 1 He made the following an
nouncement:
Concerning the- other nine features of
the bonding schemeâ the parks, boule
vards, school, city hall and street im
provement plans, the' checking up of
votes to-day made no change in the
result. .â¢â¢Â¦â¢Â¦ >
An official count will probably be re
quired to -determine the, fate of. two
of the bonding propositionsâ The sewer
and wharf dredging projects may have
received the necessary two-thirds vote.
The. vote Is so close that not, until the
City' Council has canvassed the ballots
will the result in these two cases be
definitely known. ,

S H. BETHEA. United States Attorney.
WASHINGTON, Sept. 28.â Secretary
Loeb to-night made public a dispatch
from United States District Attorney
Bethea at Chicago, regarding the letter
purporting to have been addressed by
President Roosevelt to Michael Donnel
ly of Chicago, president of the Butch
ers' and Meatcutters' Union, and, se
verely arraigning labor unions. The
dispatch says that Donnelly, received
no such letter. The telegram follows:
CHICAGO. September 28, 1004.
We had no tholght, of course, of being able
to make even a presentable Imitation of the
President's literary style, and as the article
was at the time commented upon and repro
duced somewhat extensively ln the press, we
never dreamed of its ever coming to figure aa
a "campaign forgery."
The Evening Post also says:
The letter appeared as an editorial in the
Evening Post of August 1 and was explicitly
stated to be a letter which the President
"MIGHT have written" with advantage to
himself and the country.
In other words, it was confessedly an imag

out certain truths in regard to the meat strike.

considered a martinet and altogether a

critical and sarcastic references to the
fact that General Corbin was himself
recently married, after months of ard

Washington lady, formerly of San

Hints come from Butte Cbunfcr that
the Democratic politicians areBaying
the wires to transform the. irrigation
celebration at Gridley,, which' ought to
be a purely non-partisan and I indus
trial, demonstration, into a side show
for the display of Theodore Bell and
other Democratic aspirants for public
office. Bell's itinerary. as given by the
Democratic State Central Committee
contains this significant entry: "Satur
day, Oct. 1, Gridley, morning (Irrigation
celebration)." It is said that other
well known opponents of the Republi
can national administration have been
invited to make themselves conspicur
ous on that occasion. There are no in
dications that the Republicans have
any notion of keeping out of sight at
Gridley on October 1. In fact, intelli
gence comes from that region of Cali
fornia that Republican citizens will be
there in force and see to it that a
great industrial enterprise for the de
velopment of the State shall not be
converted into a Bourbon barbecue.
BOURBOXS ARE PERPLEXED.
The situation in'the Democratic camp
at Santa Cruz is attracting the interest
of the Bourbons around the headquar
ters of the Democratic Stata Central
Committee in this city, if has been
announced that Ed White, brother of
the late .Stephen M. White, is being
urged to accept the nomination of the
Senatorial District Convention when it
meets. He has not consented to be
come a candidate.
It has been stated that in the event
that White decides to run he must
withdraw from the electoral ticket, but
those best informed say this is not a
fact. They point out that in 1880 R. F.
Del Valle was elected to the Senate
from Los Angeles County and at the
same time ran on the Democratic elec
toral ticket. There is nothing in the
law to prevent White from running on
both tickets, but, even with this ques
tion eliminated, it is said the Demo
crats will have some trouble ln getting
him to accept the nomination. The
reason is that his party in his district
is split by factions that refuse to com
promise, notwithstanding the approach
of the campaign.
The Democratic municipal convention
will meet next * Monday-; evening and
proceed to the nomination of Judicial
and Legislative tickets.
At the next meeting of the Iroquois

BERKELEY, Sept. 28. â The final of

drew a big crowd to Odd Fellows*

Clerks were on hand and enough new
names were secured to increase the
registration of Berkeley to something
more than 2800, the largest in the
history of the town. John M. Foy,

OAKLAND, Sept. 28. â The Oakland

SAN JOSE. Sept. 23.â Rev. H. C. Meredith,
for four years pastor of the Methodist Episco
pal Church ln this city, has resigned. The
resignation will take effect Immediately. Mr.
Meredith will devote his time to missionary
work among the California Indians. " ..iv
It is estimated by the Registrar that
from 70,000 to 72,000 votes will cast in
this city next November. In 1900 73,633
names were on the great register. At
the Presidential election that year
65,000 ballots were cast. Basing his
calculations on these figures, the Reg
istrar holds that atjeast 70,000 votes
should be cast at the coming election,
the registration this year being 10.9
per cent greater than that of four
years ago.
Though registration closed last night,
certificates of removal may be obtained
from the Registrar up to midnight of
October 13.
Eighty-two thousand three hundred
and eighty-six names are on the great
register of the city and county of San
Francisco. Registration closed at mid
night last night after one of the busiest
days in the history of the office. More
than 4000 made known their intention
to vote at the coming election. The
work of handling this number was a
task of unusual magnitude and the of
fices of the Registrar proved too small
for the carrying on of the work. As a
result, the Registrar's storeroom was
cleared and twenty-five clerks installed
at improvised desks. These arrange
ments completed, the big task of regis
tering more than 4000 voters was ac
complished.
HELENA, Mont. Sept 28.â In his
principal speech here to-night Senator
Fairbanks discussed at some length the
charges of corruption made against the
Republican party, extending and mak
ing more specific his remarks at Great
Falls. He refrained carefully from
mention of Judge Parker's name, but
it was understood by all that the
speech was inspired by the utterances
of the Democratic candidate oh this
subject in his letter of acceptance.
Speaking c-f the part played by Presi
dent Roosevelt in the prosecution of
the Postoffice I>epartment scandals,
Fairbanks said:
He has enforced the , law. He has driven
corruption oat of public place. We know that
ln private experience ln every community there
are evil doers, but they are comparatively few.
The one who will betray public trust ,is the
exception. He Insinuates himself into private
employment, into corporate employment, into
the DUblic employment. Theodore Roosevelt
knew that and he determined that, so fas as
lay within his power, the betrayer of the gen
eral interest should be whipped out of place
and i>ower. He set to work a corps of in
spectors ln the rreat a'ostofflo* Department,
one of the greatest pieces of official mechanism
in the world. Thousands are employed in It â
yes. tens of thousands. Is It at all to be
wondered at that now and then among this
vast army tUere should be one who should
forÂ«et his duty to his Government and go
wrong? It i* not to be wond-sred at. The
President undertook to find out whether &ome
one was betraying his trust and he made dis
coveries â not many, but a few, comparatively.
Who were the offenders? Some Republicans,
some .Democrats. What did he' do? Did he
undertake to conceal the result of the Investi
gation from the knowledge of men? No. He
brought the evil doers to the bar of Justice.
The Department of Justice prosecuted them,
and in many cases the guilty are. wearing the
stripes of their guilt.
Those who talk of corruption In the admin
istration must bear In mind, if they be Just,
that there 13 no man living with a higher
Idea of civic duty, with a more exalted ideal
of official responsibility than Theodore Roose
velt. President, of the Cinited States. He has
no sympathy with wrong doers, because he is
a right doer himself. Clean himself, he wish*s
all men in public service to be likewise clean.
The continuance of President Roosevelt's ad
ministration means si continuance of a rigid,
searching scrutiny of all the offices of the
Government and the certain condemnation and
punishment of evil doers, no matter how low
or how exalted they be.
This outline of the President's course
was received with general applause.
Fairbanks also discussed the tariff
question and the subject of irrigation,
again giving the President and Sen
ator Carter credit for much that has
been done toward extending Govern
ment aid in the reclamation of the arid
lands. There were two meetings to
night, one being held at the Auditorium
and the other at the Helena Theater.
Senators Fairbanks and Dolliver spoke
at both meetings. Fairbanks opening
at the Auditorium and closing at the
theater, while DolHver reversed this or
der.
The meetings were attended by full
houses and they were preceded by a
brilliant street demonstration.
Congressman McLachlan was the
principal speaker at the meeting to
night. He discussed national issues
in a. masterly manner and presented
the magnificent record of the Republi
can party in a clear and concise style
that won hearty applause.
McKinlay was slightly indisposed,
but he spoke for over half an . hour.
He has always been a favorite in
Colusa and his reception was spontane
ous and sincere. His remarks received
the closest attention.
COLUSA, Sept. 28.â The Republican
campaign in Colusa was opened here
to-night before an audience that test
ed the capacity of the opera-house.
The speakers were: D. E. McKinlay,
the nominee for Congress in the Sec
ond District, and Congressman James
McLachlan. The position of the latter
upon the House Rivers and Harbors
Committee made his visit here of spe
cial to the people of this sec
tion, and he was interviewed by many
prominent residents in regard to the
river improvement. He was thorough
ly impressed with the importance of
the transportation conditions of this
section, and assured the people here
that this visit in conjunction with
McKinlay will bear fruit when he re
turns to Washington.
The way to keep the gold standard out of
danpt'r is to keep it ln the hands of those who
pot it out of dancer.
Even the changing of a single schedule- Is no
work for the prejudiced or Ignorant. For
Cher fchedules are related to it; and to all
these is adjusted the vast business of thÂ«
Â£r<?ate*t of huelne** nations. Republican re
vision w any schedule means the thoughtful
consideration of every other schedule.
As to the trust Question, Senator
Beveridge said:
The organizations of Industry should
neither bt persecuted nor favored. They should
have Fimr'.e justice like everybody Â«lsÂ«. All
men. all interests, protected or punished by law
according as they do right or wrong â this is
Republicanism la a sentence, Americanism' in
a j-hrase.
fc-Â« far as legislation ccn remedy the evils
of trusts, republican legislation â the Sherman
law. the rehate law, the department of Com
merce and I^abvr law â the only legislation ever
'naot'ii on the subject â will do It If enforced.
Ati" 4 . ITmf ifil'a election means enforcement oZ
t.'.r-sf Ir.wf and all laws.
Discussing at length the financial
question, Senator Bev;eridge said:
Men talk cf tariff revision as though It wm
â¢ simple thing â an easy tatk. No problem Is
mow intricate. Whst Is the tariff? It Is not
en artiflcijil Ftructure to be taken apart and

It Is the development of a theory of statesman
ship. It is a growth and not a creation. Those
who prepared the soil of this nation planted
ln that soil the seeds of the American indus
trial Independence which men call protection.
If here and there a branch now needs prun
ing, those who planted the tree and have
iruarded its growth i^iould do it, not those
who resisted its planting In the first place
end who for a hundred yearn have sought to
lay the i.x on its roots.
What !s this campaign about? What busi
&Â«*>Â» rcsn but wishes that no election were
necessary this year? The administration's
policies are successful at hcroe and abroad.
The test that the opposition's ablest man,
Grovcr Cleveland, can bay for It Is that It
"shows eigns of returcir-g sanity." Yet this
political convalescent demands control of the
(government, declaring that it could not now
undo much that the Republican party has
done If it would, and would not undo much
ihat the Republican party haÂ« done if It could.
The flrrt result ot Parker's election would
be a tariff agitation without result, since Mr.
Parker himself tells us that a Republican Sen
ate would prevent legislation. Such agitation
Â¦pells but-ineas uncertainty, and uncertainty
ppelis business disaster.
Even If the opposition controlled House,
Pfcate acd President they themselves could
not tjtil what kind of tariff law they would
l*ts. For some of them, like Mr. Bryan, are
free-traders; some, like Mr. Gorman, are pro
tectionists. Thlsk of an engineer trying to

. SUMMARY. :
This is the last day Al Hereford's
$1000 forfeit will remain up to bind
a match between Gans and Britt for
the lightweight championship at 133
pounds, ringside. Hereford has no
reason to believe Britt will consider
the match, although he placed him
self on record as being desirous of
such a meeting at a recent gathering
in Woodward's Pavilion. Failing to
get Britt for Gans, Hereford Is .will
ing* to let the money go as a forfeit
and ultimately as a side bet for Kid
Sullivan to box Britt at any weight
from 128 to 133 pounds,- ringside. He
says it was for this reason he brought
Sullivan to the coast.

Gans' Forfeit Is Still Pasted.
Says Constables Beat Him.
Barney Burns, a carriage washer,
who has been employed in Frultvale,
is held for observation at the Central
Emergency Hospital, the surgeons
suspecting that his skull is fractured.
Burns tells a strange story of an en
counter with two constables in Fruit
vale, who accused him of stealing a
dog and beat him unmercifully when
he declared that he had raised the
dog. He says the officers struck him
over the head several times .with
clubs, .and .that his mind was a blank
from that' time till he found himself
wandering aimlessly In San Leandro.
He sought his friends in this city and
they sent him to the hospital.

Knocks Him Down hi the First Round
With a Right Swine to
the Jaw.
PHILADELPHIA, Sept. 28.â The
Hughey McGovern-Murphy fight here
to-night resulted in a six-round draw.
. There was only one knockdown
during the entire contest and that was
at the beginning of the first round,
when Tommy Murphy went down
from a right swing to the jaw. He
was up in a moment; however, and
returned the blow with another which
opened a cut over If cGovern's eye.
Murphy was the aggressor at the
start, but McGovern did not seek to
avoid him at any time.- The exchange
of blows was rapid and severe all the
time the men were on their feet. At
the end of the bout both showed signs
of weariness and distress, but neither
had at any time secured a decided ad
vantage. . Â¦

NEW YORK, Sept. 28. â Prepara
tions are already being made by mem
bers of the New York Yacht Club for
the defense of the America's cup
against a possible fourth challenge
from Sir Thomas Llpton. Members of
the club think that a challenge may be
expected by any mall, and that as in
former years it will come from the
Royal Ulster Yacht Club. Sir Thomas
has not yet announced that he had
made the necessary arrangements with
a designer, but club members believe
that a challenge Is sure to come and
are only waiting to find out what con
ditions are named before gÂ«lng active
ly to work to build the defender.
â¢ It is the opinion among the mem
bers of the yacht club that when the
challenge comes it will ask for a race
under the same conditions that gov
erned the last one. According to the
deed of gift no race can be sailed later
than November 1 and ten months' no
tice must be given when the challenge
is made. A challenge received by De
cember 1 would make the date for the
first race October 1.
Members of the Xew York Yacht Club
Expect to Hear From. Sir
Thomas Soon.

The first mid-week stake of the year
to be run at Union Coursing- Park was
decided yesterday before a good at
tendance. Frisco Lad landed the coin.
He performed in grand style, defeating
in the deciding course that fast young
futurity puppy Confident. The latter
was a surprise, and went down the line,
beating the veteran campaigners one
after the other.
The coursing was good, some excit
ing trials being run. Confident's per
formance was the notable event of thÂ»
day. Many thought the youngster
would take the more experienced dog
into camp in the final, but Frisco Lad
shut his lively young opponent out
without a point. Following are the

Eastern FootbalL
For a time the men who like to have
a little wager down on every prizefight
seemed to think Walcott and Gans
should be coupled in the betting for
their engagement to-morrow night at
Woodward's Pavilion. This was based
on previous performances. This feeling
is rapidly wearing away owing to the
glowing reports disinterested people are
bringing from the rival training camps.
The boxers are training as though
their lives depend on the outcome of
the contest. Referee Jack Welch will
prepare a statement to-day making
known his interpretation of the rules
and also the agreement entered into
by the boxers. -"';,
This Is expected to stimulate the bet
ting. A wager of $100 at even money
was recorded yesterday. Jack Collins,
who took the Walcott end. has $1000
more to place at the same price. Col
lins saw Gans work on Tuesday and
pronounced him a speed marvel.' He
went to Walcott's quarters yesterday
and what he saw made him change his
views entirely.
To show what an abnormal fighter
Walcott is Manager Pierce said yester
day he would be willing to match him
against Brjtt at 135 pounds or against
Jack Johnson, the colored heavyweight
champion, who- is dying to fight Jeff
ries â and probably would if he did.
BOXERS AKE MEASURED.
The boxers were measured yesterday
and the tape showed some marked dif
ferences in their build. Gans is four
and a half inches taller than Walcott,
while the latter has two and three
quarter inches greater reach. Walcott
Is much larger in the arms. Jeffries Is
the only fighter who has larger biceps
than the freak fighting man as shown
in the following list:
Jeffries, 16Â»Â£ inches; Walcott, 14; Jim
Corbett, 13%; Fltzsimmons, 13%; Jack
O'Brien. 12%; Kid Lavigne, 13; Willie
Fitzgerald, 12%; Terry McGovern, 13;
Frankie Neil, 12%; Young Corbett, 11%;
Eddie Hanlon, 12U, and Britt, 12. The
complete measurements of the colored
boxers follow:
Gans â Five feet 6 lnche* height; 136U pounds
in weight; 15 U Inches neck; 36 Inches cheat
(normal); 39 Inches chest (expanded); 29}j
inches walbt;'lÂ»Va inches forearm; 11*13 Inches
biceps; 20 Inches thigh; 13 Inches calf; 62 !i
Inches reach. ' Â¦ Â¦Â».
Walcottâ FivAeet 1% inches In height; 141
pounds in weight; lfi'-j inches neck; 37 Inches
chest (normal); 40 Inches chest (expanded);
30 inches waist; 12 Inches forearm; 14 Inches
biceps; 22 Inches thigh; 14 Inches calf; 65
Inches reach.
Walcott Is 32 years old and has been
fighting steadily for fourteen years.
Gans is 2S years old and has been be
fore the public for nine years.
WAL.COTT TRIES IX)W WEIGHT.
Walcott â¢ tried to get down to 138
pounds yesterday without drying out.
He came off the road tired as the re
sult of his exertions. He recuperated
quickly and then put in a tremendous
afternoon in the gymnasium. It was
to be his last boxing before the fight
and he went at it with a will.
He was bubbling over with good
humor and seemed tireless. He first
took on Jim Hayward for three round3.
He shapes like Gans without the lat
ter's speed. It was fight from start to
finish, neither boxer asking any favors.
When it was over Hayward could
readily have posed as the slugged out
slugger.
Young McConnell, who weighs 163
pounds, also went three rounds. This
was also replete with slugging. The
spectators watched it breathlessly, al
most expecting a tragedy, although the
hands of the boxers were encased In
pillows of gloves. After it was all over
Walcott strutted about like a turkey
cock as though such work was a mere
incident of his training.
Gans believes In road work, his jaunt
yesterday taking him sixteen miles. He
did his last boxing during the after
noon. Kid Sullivan and Rudolph Gross
man each went eight rounds with him.
Two spectators also. put on the gloves
with the champion. One had enough In
two rounds, while three suffloed the
other.
The advance sale of seats, which is
being held at Greggalns' cafe, indicates
a large attendance. There will be two
preliminaries, the first brace of boxers
entering the ring promptly at 8 o'clock.
Somebody haa estimated that the
Lake Suoerlor Iron deposits will be ex
hausted In twenty-five years.

The curtain was about to be rung
I down on the little matinee at Recrea
tion Park yesterday afternoon when
the Angels sprang a run on the fans
who were there to welcome home the
Seals. The one run did not count at
all, for Uncle already had four put
away and was riding on velvet. Score,
San Francisco 4. Los Angeles 1.
The pretty weather induced the toss
ers to play pretty ball. In nearly every
spasm something that might be termed
sensational was unloaded to the de
light of the fans. The game was gone
through in an hour and fifteen minutes,
which Is the record for the season and
maybe for a good many seasons.
Jimmy Whalen was the leading
i spirit, ably assisted by Parke Wilson,
j for the first time this season, and the
rett of the bunch. They all played
great baseball and hit when hits meant
I runs. Whalen never had so much in
his life as he possessed yesterday.
Those left-handers were Just swinging
their heads off and even then they
could not bing safely.
The Seals began to jump into the
thick of the fight in round one, when
Meany's hit to right was juggled by
Cravath and Pat went to second. An
derson brought him home by binglng
one out past Flood. Two more were
annexed in the seventh. This time
Van Buren started it with a scratchy
hit, and Hlldebrand bunted at the
plate. Spies threw the ball to first, but
no one was there.
In the meantime Van kept tearing
till he reached the pan. Hildebrand
pulled up at third and he also arrived
on Meany's bingle past first. The last
one was trotted in during the eighth.
Again Van soaked It out and Hilde
sacrificed. Waldron bunted and Flood
dropped Hall's perfect throw. Meany
swung through safely for the third
time and the last run was a reality.
With two gone in the ninth, the An
gels got theirs. Ross had just chopped
one off and advanced on Spies' out.
Eagar was brought in to take a clout
at It in Hall's place, but he only hit
wind. Bernard placed a good one out
to left and Roes barely got in, saving
Morley from the humiliation of a
whitewash. The score:

CHICAGO, Sept. 28.â Gloriosa, the
four-year-old mare, Which Tichenor &
Co. sold at auction to C. E. Durnell,
and which won the silver cup and
purse for licensed trainers as riders at
Harlem last -Thursday, and which also
won at Worth on Monday, made it
three straight to-day by annexing the
third event on the card. Owner Dur
nell, however, lost money on the out
come, as Gloriosa was entered. to be
sold for $500 and was bid up to $1400
by ''Red" Walker, and retained for
$1500 by her owner. The mare was. a
prohibitive favorite at 2 to 6 in the ;
ring. . Durnell could not have profited
through her victory, as he did not back
her heavily. The favorite's winning \
margiiAhowever, wa s only a head over
Mr. Fmura in a fierce drive.
â¢ The talent gave r.the bookmakers a
terrific founding, picking four winners
and two second choices.
The track was fetlock deep in mud,
and racing was Â¦ therefore uncertain.

Thomas' crallant Hlly Lady Amelia was
accorded another whole souled ovation
when she returned to the judges' stand
to-day. after winning the feature event
She fairly earned all the good things
said abo t her as for the third consec
utive time she led a big field of fast
racers from start to finish. She car
ried 140 pounds and conceded thirty
two pounds to Letola, twenty pounds
to Collector Jessup, thirty-two pounds
to Ascension, forty-two pounds to In
vincible and twenty-two pounds to the
erstwhile speed marvel from the West,
the two-year-old Handzarra.
LÂ»ady Amelia led all the way. Be
hind her the most notable flight of
speed was that shown t>y Handzarra,
which ran up from fifth to second place
in the first quarter, but failed to hold
her own. Collector Jessup, forced to
run outside of three others on the
stretch turn, made a strong bid in
company with Letola, but Lady Ame
lia, next the rail all the way. responded
well to Iiedfern's call and lasted long
enough to win by something less than

I lave been suffering from Impure Blood
for man/ years, having Boils and other
Eruptions. Having heard of S. S. S. I de-
cided to try it, and am glad to say that it
has tloae me a great deal of good. I intend
to continue to use it, as I believe it to be
the best Blood Uedicine on the market.
Cleveland, Tenn. W. K. Deters.
For over fifteen years I have suffered
more or less f rom Impure Blood. About a
vear ago I liad a boil appear on my leg
!;e!or the knee, which was followed by
uiree more on mj neck. I saw S. S. S.
cdvertised and decided to try it. After
taking three bottles all Boils di^ippeared
and I have not been troubled any since.

From childhood I shad been bothered
Tr;th bad blood, skin eruptions and boils.
I had boils ranging from five to twenty in
number each season. _ The burning ac-
companying the eruption was terrible.
S. S. S. "seemed to be just the medicine
needed in my case. It drove out all impu-
rities and bad blood, giving me penna-
ncut relief from the skin eruption and
Iroils. This has been ten years ago, and I
have never had a return of the disease.

Two Cargoes for Hawaii.
United States Local Inspectors Bolles
and Bulger concluded yesterday the in
vestigation into the grounding of the
Northland off Point Pinos.
Captain S. Bonifleld, master of the
ship, denied that he had given an or
der to be awakened when the patent
log showed 100, as testified by First
Mate Hedvall. The order had been
communicated to Hedvall by Second
>Jate Johannsen. Captain Bonifleld
said that Hedvall or Johannsen must
have been mistaken.
The mate denied having told the
captain that he had seen the Point
Pinos light on the port bow.
Lawyer Mahoney, who appeared for
Captain Bonifleld. said that one of the
passengers informed the captain that
just before the vessel struck he had
seen Mate Hedvall in a position wbich
Indicated that he had either been
asleep or drunk. The passenger, how
ever, was in Los Angeles, he said.
Mate Hedvall, with tears in his eyes,
protested that he was not a drinking
man and had not tasted \ a drop of
liQUor for three years.
The case was then closed.
Captain Boniflcld Contradicts Mate
Iledvall as to a Very Material
Order. He Had Given.

CONFLICT OF STORIES
IX NORTHLAND CASE
The third annual exhibit of the San
Francisco Architectural Club, which
opened Tuesday at the Mechanics' In
stitute, is a famous success, the rooms
last night being thronged with men
and women interested in the art of
homebulldlng.
The rooms are attractively decorated
with forest greenery, and a brilliant
lighting gives to each drawing a fair
chance for honor.
Perhaps the drawing that attracts
most attention Is thÂ« United States
Custom-house plans, prepared by lo
cal architects. While attractive and
imposing, much regret was expressed
that a local architect was not the win
ner of the competition. Those who
were permitted to view Newton J.
Tharp's plans spoke loud In praise of
their superiority. These plans were
unfortunately delaved in transmission,
arriving too late to be entered in tha
competition.
The city homes are holding most of
the attention, many of which are of a
type to cultivate public taste.
Al lin all. the exhibit is said to be
the cleverest yet held in the citv.
It will continue to remain open all
week, afternoon and evening, free to
the public

The islanders are a simple, good
natured, lovable people, with few, if
any, vices and they have been as de
lighted with San Francisco as children
with a circus.
In order to prevent these simple and .
honest people from _ falling into the j
snares of the Barbary Coast, Rev. H. j
M. Tenney, local secretary of the Amer
ican Board of Foreign Missions of the
Congregational church, has taken
charge of them and will pilot them
safely through the shoals and quick
sands of the strenuous life. Until they
shall sail for home they will be housed
on the bark Agate, which is lying in
Oakland Creek. i
Eight dark-skinned natives of thÂ«
Caroline Islands imparted a picturesque
air yesterday to the United States Im
migrant Bureau. They had arrived in
this port as members of the crew of
the schooner Vine, which is engaged
as a trader in copra and shells among
the islands of the South Seas, and they
do not expect tc/ be reshipped for two
or three weeks yet. They are mem
bers cf the Congregational church and
were accompanied on the voyage hither
by Miss Jennie Olin, a missionary of
that church. She took them a day orr
two ago to the ClifT House and the
Chutes and they were delighted with
the treat. Said one of them who
speaks English well: "All I want now
is to go home and stay there the rest
of my life; I have seen ,the big world
and now I am satisfied. I do not
want to wander any more."

617 Mjrket Sfttet, Palact Hotsl."Oh!"
"M'hm! Well, as it happened. I was going out myself. It was the
evening of my card club and I didn't really mfcid his going, too. though,
of course,' I told him not to stay late."
"Yes. Well?"
"I reached home at 12:30 and found, to my horror, that he hadn't
come 'yet. The truth is that I had let both our maids go to an affair
and "
"But I thought he had told you never to do that."
"He did. But a man's place is at home with his wife, anyhow. Be
sides, I knew that even if he found out that I had done it he would only
scold a little, while if I refused to let Jane go she would probably leave
and coax Alma to give warning, too."
"Oh, I never thought of that!"
"No, dear, they don't seem to teach girls how to be wives and house
keepers at Vassar. When I found that Fred hadn't returned yet I was
awfully frightened. Grace and Jack brought me home, but they were so
anxious to get off and begin to quarrel about the way she trumped his
ace and how he frowned At her publicly for it that they slipped away as
soon as my key turned in the lock. And there I was. alone in that biff
house at nearly 1 o'clock, and my lawful protector at his club playing
poker!"
"It certainly was not a very pleasant experience."
"It was not at all pleasant, and I waited an hour and a half, gettin*
madder all the time. The worst of it was that I knew he'd meet my re
proaches with the story of the Western man and the promise of the new
fall gown."
"Well, didn't you want a new "
"My dear, I meant to get the gown anyhow. A man cant let his wife
wear rags. At 2:30 I heard him coming up the street with that horrid
Mr. Nobson, and I Just deteremlned to give him a fright. I turned down
the gas and slipped into the little closet under the stairs where we keep
the coats. Then I waited, with the door opened about an inch, to hear
what he would say when he found the house empty and the woman he had
promised to love and cherish probably robbed and murdered."
"What did he do?" asked the other, breathlessly.
"He hunted all over the house, then he went out and called to Mr.
Nobson, who had stopped to light a cigar: 'I say, old man, I'm in luck;
she isn't home yet! Let's go back to the club for an hour, and I'll tell
her I got home at 11:30 and the house was so lonely without her that I
took a stroll through the park to pass the time.' And then the two .of
them walked away laughing."
"Well, you had the satisfaction of telling him all about It at the
breakfast table this morning, anyhow," suggested her friends.
"Yes, I had; and that's why I am out shopping now," Mrs. Fred said
grimly.â r New York Pres.
â¢7- HEY met at the remnant counter in one of the big dry goods shops.
O* "You look sort of haggard to-day, dear." said the taller of the two
sympathetically. "Didn't you sleep well last night?"
.'Â¦Urn- no." was the reply. "Iâ well, you see, Fred went to his
club right after dinner and I knew he meant to stay pretty late, because
he told me so carefully that he expected to meet a Western Â»an
whom he hoped to do a nice little stroke of business. He also unneces
sarily mentioned the fact that I should have the prettiest new fall gown
In N6w York if he succeeded."
WHY MRS. FRED WAS OUT SHOPPING
THE NEW FURS.
Brown is to be the color In furs this season â old fashioned reddish
brown. The new fur. yeda (unborn calf) Is talked much of. Jackets
and entire suits are to be made of this.
Then there Is a revival of mink â the small Eastern mink, -which Is
almost as rich as sable and nearly as costly. Sable in Its darkest tones
Is again to come to the fore.
Ermine will be used in combination with- those dark furs and the
furriers tell us mole will, be in .favor.
':'.'-.' PLATD SILKS FOR WAISTS.
Very pretty things are to be found in plaid silks for winter waists.
There are different combinations of blue and green, with lines of red
and yellow running through them, as well as red plaids. There is the
greatest variety in the taffeta, but there are also pretty designs In the
louisines, which are softer and more serviceable for a waist for general
wear.
LATEST CONCERNING HATS.
A pretty hat in the colors of the season ia a toque or turban, deep
brown, with the edge formed of rosettes of orange velvet set into other
rosettes of brown silk.
Olive is rivaling many newer colors.
Coque pompons are good on all shapes.
Narrow ribbon quillings are often massed.
* One whole hat is formed of petals made of ribbon.
Many, call the warm cinnamon brown olgnon brule. \
Mushroom brims support some hats with high crowns.
Broad silk ruches match the hat, being lined with another color.
Fine tangerine chenille adorns a tulle toque in cream and gold.
Many a black hat is simply trimmed with a stunning white plume.
GOLD BEADS IN FAVOR.
Gold beads have acquired a great popularity among young girls,

SUGAR AND BUTTER POINTERS.
Granulated sugar is better than powdered sugar for cake. It is
purer and makes a lighter cake. Even though the best materials are
used a cake can easily be spoiled If Hhe butter and sugar are not
beaten to a light, even cream. If the bowl is a little warm and the but
ter ~is reduced to a soft, even consistency the work Is lightened, but on
no account should the butter be melted.
When baking a cake there should be a strong body of fire, but the
heat should be turned off enough to make the oven only moderately
hot. The cake should rise to the top of the pan before it browns and
care must be taken that it does not fall, as it will if the oven door is
suddenly opened so that a draft reaches it.

PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT has said: "The, standard of liv
ing of our wage earners is higher than that of any other country
and it cannot so remain unless we have a protective tariff which
shall always keep as a minimum a rate of duty sufficient to cover
the difference between the labor cost here and abroad. Those who,
like our opponents, 'denounce protection as a robbery' thereby ex
plicitly commit themselves to the proposition that if they were to
revise the tariff no heed would be paid to the necessity of meeting
this difference between the standards of living for wage earners here
and in other countries."
These words of Roosevelt, set forth in his delineation of cam
paign issues at the time of his acceptance of the nomination, define
one of the principles upon which protection rests its case. The
Republican policy of a protective tariff can point for its justification
to the recced of wages alone in thÂ« general manifestations of our
eight years of fatness. The census of 1900 revealed the fact that
the total of wages paid that year amounted to $2,330,578,010, nearly
one-sixth of- the total value of the product of manufacture. In no
previous census year has the amount of the wage throughout the
country in any degree approximated that of 1900, nor has it been in
so high a ratio to the net results of manufacture.
The British Tariff Commission now endeavoring to get at the
root of the distress of labor in Great Britain has found that in the
steel and iron industries free trade has wrought so disastrously in
competition with American and German protection that those ar
tisans in the mills who have been fortunate enough not to be dis
charged through lack of work are, many of them, working on re
duced time, with a wage corresponding. As opposed to this state
of affairs, *in one industry only, where free trade strikes a direct
blow at the wage earner, the record of protection in- our own coun
try offers itself â a proof made manifest without argument.
The value of our domestic exports for 1896, the last year of the
four of free trade, was $863,200,487; we imported goods to the total
value of $779,724,67^. For the first year of protective tariff, 1897, the
following figures speak: Exports, $1,032,007,603; imports, $764,730,
412.. For the year just ended with June 30 last the world stands in
our debt to the amount of over $444,000,000, our exports passing by
that sian the value of imports and registering $1,435,151,285 to the
credit of the protective system. Of the value of our exports for
the last year $450,000,000 represents the output of factories, where
the wage earner feels directly the fluctuations in the balance of
trade. Ten years ago, under the administration of Grover Cleveland,
the export of manufactured products was $184,000,000, 21 per cent
of the entire export; for the last year our manufactured material
shipped abroad aggregated 33 per cent of our entire foreign sales.
Truly does President Roosevelt strike the right note when. he
says that continued protective tariff makes for continued high wages.
With the products of our mills and forges, yearly forming one-third
of the total export, and 'with the balance of trade comfortably on our
side, four more years of protection would not seem to be the ter
rible catastrophe that the builders of Democratic cyclone cellars
predict. Â¦ - . ',

"Be honest." â¢' Â»â¢ Â»
There is no better word of parting. There is nothing more conducive to
straight, clean school life than the 'thought in the child that mother be
lieves he Is honest, mother wants him to be honest above all things, even
above grades themselves.
So when the little one leaves the home for the school life, call after
him, "Be honest." That is enough.
IF you're licked at school, you'll catch it at home!"
"If your grades are highest in the class I'll pay yon for it."
These are a few of the parting word3 that parents give their chil
dren on their first day at school. Do the parents realize what these part-
Ing words may mean to the child? asks a writer in the Plttsburg Press.
How many times is the child told, "Be honest." "Do your own work."
"Be honest."
If every child were sent away from home with those two words ringing
in his ears many of the rough places wonld be smoothed for both mother,
child and teacher.
"If you're licked at school !"
What will be the effect of such a parting? If the child is punished he
will conceal it from the parents, fearing a repetition of the punishment. So
his own parents have taught him to deceive. If he Is asked at home if he
has been punished, nine chances out of ten he will tell a lie about it. His
own parents have thus taught him to lie.
Consider the other warnings as the child steps from the home door: "I'll
pay you if your grades are high.'.'
Nothing the parent could say would so Inspire a child with a false
idea of what he goes to school for. The child is sent to school to learn, not
to get high grades. The grades are the effect' rather than the cause.
What is the result of paying a child for high grades? If he <Jpesn*t
know what to say when examination time comes he will be so eager to get
the high grade that he will be tempted to peep on some one's paper or to
open a book. His own parent may be making him a cheat.
TEACH YOUR CHILD TO BE HONEST
'yHE census of 1880 showed that 21,000,000 of our people were
1 engaged in gainful occupations. The census of 1900 shows an
*Â¦ increase to 29,073,233. No account is taken in either enumer
ation of women and children occupied at home. Yet they are really
a part of the gain-making population.
Between 1880 and 1900 those engaged in commercial pursuits
increased 38 per. cent; in the professions 108 per cent; domestic and
personal service 63 per cent; trade and transportation 150 per cent;
manufactures and mechanical pursuits 89 per cent. The number
ot women engaged in gainful occupations increased 100 per cent;
of men 61 per cent. Going to special classes, actors and showmen
increased 367 per cent, and architects, designers and draughtsmen
360 per cent. This implies an increase in the demand for amuse
ment?, and a vast expansion in building and construction. The
number of clergymen increased 73 per cent, and of "dentists 140 per
cent.
In the same period the number engaged in agricultural pursuits
decreased 10 per cent. This is the only decrease. Yet the output of
agricultural products increased, keeping pace with the home demand
and furnishing the largest part of our exports from" its surplus. This
means that the introduction of labor-aiding machinery on the- farms
has made" manual labor less necessary, and it is declining in the
exact proportion in which implementary substitutes displace it. This
may be held also to account in part for the increase in city population,
which is recruited from the labor that is displaced on the farms. In
one aspect this lapse is not agreeable to the economist. But the ten
dency is to replace manual by mechanical force wherever possible.
Â¦The skilled trades have undergone that experience and have swung
:o a balance, and agriculture must do the same. In the same twenty
years our population increased 52tper cent and our national wealth
123 per cent.
The census returns appear to nullify some popular ideas. It
lias been supposed that the advent of the commercial trusts had de
stroyed competition and decreased the number engaged in commer
cial pursuits. But the census shows- that commercial travelers in
creased 228 per cent, and the number of merchants 7$ percent. As
this increase is greater than that of population, the popular idea
seems to be an error. The 10 per cent decrease in farm population
is,, easily absorbed in the many expanding occupations to which it
would readily resort. Street railway employes increased 520 per
cent and steam railway 146. Whether there has been an increase
in the area of farm lands and the number of farms is not given
in these statistics. Naturally there is a gain in both. The greatest
expansion is naturally in electrical and civil engineering, which in
creased 1037 per cent.
The increase in individual wealth calling for the products of art
has caused an increase in artists of 173 per cent, and in the literary
pursuits of 507 per cent, and in journalists of 144 per cent. This
proves the increase in the reading habits of the people, and the
patronage of art. Xo like increase in twenty years is known in the
history of any other nation. It could not be foreseen twenty years
ago.
Xow that statistical science gives us the accurate data of past
development, foresight has a base line from which to measure the
future. The nation has not reached the angle of repose. It must go
forward and the impetus is apparently unspent. The task of the seer
is to detect in present conditions the points of future expansion.
"What vocation will be most in demand in the two decades to come?
If in 1880 it could have been foreseen that electricity would so
develop as a dynamic and economic fprce, the men trained for that
service would have commanded the market and their price. In 1880
electricity was yet in the laboratory stage, for the most part, except
in telegraphy. Xow it is the agent in illumination, in transmission
of speech, in transportation, and in manufacturing power. In the
two decades to come it will easily appear in domestic economy as a
heater, and will be in the field of antiseptics and therape'utics to a
much greater extent than now.
It is probable that economic chemistry will see the greatest
development in the future. The world must have an annual crop
from which to make paper, in the place of the trees 'now used, which
are being rapidly destroyed by the printing press. Chemistry di
gested the wood fiber and made paper pulp possible. Will it find
an annual crop and digest its stems and silicates, and make of it
;japer stock? If so, a transfer of an industry will occur that will
occupy *u larger -force of men in production and transmutation.

Judge Garber in trust, the Interest to
be paid to his sister in the East, Mrs.
Davis, and after her death the prin
cipal was to go to her son. The son
died before the testator and the point
lor Judge Coffey to decide was
whether the trust estate, on its ter
mination, should feed the residuum
arid be divided among the heirs at law,
or whether it should be confined in its
division to the legatees in the will.
Jv.dge Coffey decided that the fifth
share in question should go into the

Separate answers to the suit of
Stephen Otis to collect a judgment of
$1657 60 from John A. Walls were
filed yesterday by Emma G. "Walls,
John A. Walls and the Central Grain
and Stock Exchange. In December,
1896. Walls, chief clerk of the Stock
Exchange, grave Otis his note for
$1077 76 involving 1 a stock deal. Otis
sued and got judgment, though Walls
pleaded that It was a gambling debt.
When attempt was made to collect it
was found that Walls had no prop
erty. Mrs. Walls, however, was the
owner of 618 shares of stock in the
Central Exchange, which was given
her by Its president, W. E. Baines.
Since May, 1900, when the gift was
made, Mrs. Walls has received $41,
000 in dividends on the securities.
Otis got permission from the court
to .sue Mrs. Walla, alleging that the
stock had been issued in her name in
her husband's interest and in order to
defraud his creditors. The defend
ants all deny this allegation and say
that Mrs. Walls is the separate owner
of the stock and Its profits. Walls ad
mits that his wife paid nothing for her
holdings. He says he has nothing to
do with the shares or the money and
only receives $250 a month salary in
his position.
Walls also charges that the Judg
ment against him, rendered in Depart
ment 12 of the Superior Court, Is
fraudulent because the court arbitrar
ily struck out his answer and refused
to hear his witnesses. He says, too,
"that in furtherance of its determina
tion to deprive him of a fair trial, the
court refused to allow his bills of ex
ceptions and a statement of the' case
on appeal. He asks that the judgment
be vacated.

-The heaviest losers are : Upton Bros.

Â¦the Eng-Shell Extract Company. The
heat of the flames in the printing office
destroyed about $10,000 worth t of ex
tracts. 'Thousands of bottles burst and
â¢their contents ' flooded the fourth floor
and dropped to 'the sidewalk. For sev
eral^npurs a vari-colored stream of ex
tracts, ran.': in t the gutter on Fremont
streetV The. Eng-Shell Company's loss

g Theflrst floor of the building was oc

â¢Engineering Company. They sustained
a. loss of about $1000. which Is covered
by insurance. The building, owned by
Mrs. Ada Taylor, was damaged $15,000.
The West Coast Wire Company lost
about $3000.
With a barrel of olive oil upon one
of his shoulders, Hugh McCaffrey was
ambling along Battery street, when an
inquisitive policeman demanded an
explanation of how- he became pos
sessed of the stuff. So shaky was his
story that it prompted further inves
tigation and the officer discovered that
the barrel had been stolen from the
premises of the Rankin Company.
"What did you intend to do with
the oil?" Judge Mogan asked the de
fendant.
"I might say that I intended to drink
it, but you wouldn't believe me,'.' was
the answer. Â¦
"Six : months f Â©r you," said the
Judere.
Nineteen-year-old Henry Golsch,
charged with having plundered a tele
phone cash box at Seventeenth and
Church streets, told Judge Mogan that
two unknown men had primed him
with liquor until he was reckless and
then urged him to commit the bur
glary, explaining to him how it could
be done with neatness and di6patch.
His 6tory is being investigated and he
will get another hearing to-morrow.
Five small boysâ Charles Everhard,
Walter Spangler, Frank Ripstein, Har
ry Page and Henry Douce â were ac
cused by Andrew Jacobson of having
stolen forty-eight doughnuts from him
at Twenty-fourth and Howard streets.
Patrolman Fogarty, who arrested the
lads, testified that they swallowed the
material evidence for the prosecution,
and Judge Cabaniss held that their re
sultant stomach pains was punishment
sufficient for their 'offense.
Marcus Perrls was in the crowd that
blocked traffic at Third and Market
streets and absorbed the bulletined re
ports of the McCoy-Sullivan prizefight,
and so enthused was he by the clever
work of; "The Kid" that he involun
tarily gave It practical illustration by
jabbing and uppercuttlng and sidestep
ping and J short-arm-joltlng persons
within his arm reach. He was environ
ed by sore and indignant victims when
Patrolman "Tom" Murphy elbowed his
way into the throng and quickly sub
jugated and then arrested him for dis
turbing the peace. Judge Mogan con
tinued the case till to-morrow In or
der to give the defendant opportunity
to prove that his fistic indulgence was
not malicious.
B. Cohn, peddler, was accused of cru
elty to animals, the specific offense be
ing the twisting of a prostrate horse's
tail in futile effort to make It rise. Mrs.
Hattle Mardis testified that Mr. Cohn's
treatment of the animal was unneces
sarily harsh, and her statement was
corroborated by H. Iben, A. P. Paul
sen and other persons, who witnessed
the tall twisting. Several small boys
averred that in so far from being cruel
to his steed Mr. Cohn's conduct was
most humane. Judge Cabaniss took
the case under advisement till October
26.
Anna Burelbacb, who accused W. H.
Pittman of having robDed her of sev
eral diamond rings and a gold watch,
told Judge Mogan that for seven years
she had been the defendant's only
means of support. During that period,
she testified, she had given him, from
time to time, 515,000 in cash. They
lived in almost every town of any size
on this coast and in each place he
posed as a gentleman until her vo
cation was discovered and then they
sought pastures new. She Is now re
siding at Victoria, B. C, and when ar
rested he was managing a get rich
quick concern In Los Angeles. The
hearing will be resumed Wednesday.
Judge Mogan continued till next Sat
urday the case of August Weinman, ac
cused of having cruelly beaten a young
child of Mrs. Annie Welntraub, which
had been placed in the "home" man
aged by him at 4109 Twenty-first street.
Secretary Levy of the Eureka Hebrew
Benevolent Society testified that the
child had been entrusted to Weinman's
care by that organization, the mother
being unable to provide for It, and that
it was properly treated. Mrs. Kate
Pettie, manager of the Universal Ser
vice Society, stated that the child had
been struck with a cane by Weinman
and its thighs showed evidence of the
severity of the punishment. The de
fendant, a blind man, then averred that
Mrs. Weintraub's object in complaining
against him was to recover .the custody,
of the child and get the %1 month which
the Eureka Society paid him for its
support. The continuance was made
in order to get the testimony of neigh
bors as to the treatment received by
the little inmates of the Weinman
home.
â¢ â¢ *
Judge Mogan thought that the re
pairing of the window was a trifling
matter to quarrel about and Mr. Wells
emphatically stated that he would
neither pay for a new pane nor leave
the house. "It is not the price of the
glass but the principle of the thing
that impels me to this attitude," quoth
Mr. Wells. To which Mr. Douglas,
speaking for Mrs. Condon as well as
himself, retorted by asserting that un
til the window is repaired or the Wells
folk vacate the house not a drop of
water shall be conveyed to the latter
through the pipe leading from his
pump.
"I have seen such asinine stubborn
ness on the mimic stage," said the
Judge, "but never till now has it con
fronted me in court. You remind me
of the obstinate characters in a New
England rural drama. The time of this
tribune is too valuable to be wasted in
trying to bring reason to bear upon
such stubbornness and the case is dis
missed. But if you are again brought
here for disturbing the peace of your
neighbors by fighting you may find less
leniency."
According to the testimony Mr.
Hc-uglas is the owner of a windmill
pump that supplies several of the resi
dents of Sadowa street with water and
that he shut off the aqua supply of
Mr. Wells' home because that gentle
man refused to pay for the repair of a
window in the house which had been
broken by some small boys. Mrs. Con
don, the owner of the Wells residence,
is Mr. Douglas' mother-in-law and
Mr. Wells declared that she ought to
pay for the glazing, while she, oh the
other hand, asserted that he alone
should defray the expense. It was to
help his mother-in-law* in the dispute
that Mr. Douglas deprived the Wells
family of water and it was Mr. Wells'
expostulation that led up to the fight
in which the two men were found by
the police.
Ocean View was extensively repre
sented in Police Judge Mogan's court
room yesterday morning while the
peace disturbance charge against two
prominent residents of that suburb,
Andrew Douglas of 131 Sadowa street
and William Wells of 137 Sadowa
street, was on hearing. The defendants
were levked in deadly embrace when
Patrolmen King and Cronin arrested
them and spent five minutes in tearing
them aj>art.
Charles Jon^s, a rrtilroad man, d(Pj
c'ared that his acquaintance with ili^s,
Bessie Henry was of such recent for
mation and so merely casual that he
considered her hint that he take her to
dinner an impertinence. ' It was', at
Sutter street and Grant avenue he nie>
her for the first time, he averred, and
ere they had been engaged* in, conver-.
sntion three minutes she abruptly ex
pressed an inclination- to dine- at -his
expense. He tried to ignore the sug
gestion, but she wdfild-not allow him'
to do so, and finally, when he told her
point blank that he regarded' her in- 1 "
sistence as bad form, she scolded- him
with such vehemence- as to attract a
crowd and visit^upon him. greab hu*
m iliation of spirit. "Stingy" was .the
least offensive of the adjectives she
used.
Patrolman L. J. Larkin heard a por
tion of Miss Henr~y'3'denuhbFatory'6fa'^
tion and to Judge Mogan _he/pro
nounced It "pretty tough talk." . Them
Mr. Jones remarked that never -in^1.
his life had he listened to, much less :
been made the sub'ject Qf, j3u,ch. r a;
"bunch of language." ' \ j
Miss Henry will tell her Bide- of. the
story to-morrow.' â¢ *\ , ; . '", -
Ella Johnson, the 16-year-old' glrl; v
â¢whose mother had her. arrested . forÂ°
waywardness because she attended , ! -a
party given by one.XJealie Palkeiiburg
in celebration of his : release from,
prison, was turned over to the^ custody
of Secretary White of the Society for
the Prevention of Cruelty^ to_Children,,
To plead for her release there*appear
ed In Judge Mogan's court the -parents
of Leslie Falkenburg and they were
roundly censured by his Honor for en
couraging the girl's attentions to their
son.
"I am informed," said the Judge,
"that you escorted this young girl to
the prison In which your son was serv
ing a six months' sentence for having
cruelly Ill-treated the mother of his
two illegitimate children, and that you
have been partly instrumental In caus
ing the estrangement between the girl
and her mother. Your appearance
here I consider extremely Impudent
and I would advise you to go home
and attend to the proper training of
your own children."
Little Miss Johnson will probably be
consigned to St. Catherine's Home.

BRIEF CITY NEWS.
The beauest of Charles F. Doe of
24 per cent of the $450,000 In his
estate to the Regents of the University
of California was ordered distributed
by Judge Coffey yesterday and the In
stitution will at once be enriched by
$108,000. So much .of the money as
is necessary Is to be used for the erec
tion of a library building for the aca
demic department and the surplus is
to be Invested In books. Judge Coffey
directed the executors of the estate to
pay $2700 to the Hospital for Children
and Training School for Nurses and
$1800 to 'the Boys' and Girls'. Aid So
ciety, those sums being the shares ot
the two institutions unde* the wilL
Library Ordered Paid to Resents
of Institution.
Bequest of $108,000 for Academia
UNIVERSITY IS ENRICHED
FROM THE DOE ESTATE
Annie T. Smith, niece of Mrs.
Charles Kornfeld, who was left $60,000
in the will of the deceased costumer,
Charles Kornfeld, must pay $3000 col
lateral Inheritance tax on her fortune.
Judge Coff ey made an order to this
effect yesterday. Charles S. "Wheeler
and Reuben H. Lloyd represented Miss
Smith and contended that she had
lived for years in Kornf eld's family
and had occupied a position like that
of a daughter, therefore being exempt
from the tax. John S. Partridge rep
resented the city and county. A num
ber of witnesses were examined and all
testified that Kornfeld had never ad
dressed Miss Smith as daughter and
she always called him uncle. Judge
Coffey cited that in the Jacob Z. Davis
estate two nieces whose positions were
like that of Miss Smith had to pay the
tax. Ten days were granted to Miss
Smith's attorneys In which to prepare
a bill of exceptions and Judge Coffey's
ruling will doubtless be appealed from.

General MacArthur, who held Ma
jor Adams in the highest esteem,
said:
His death is very deplorable. There Is no
praise for him too high as an officer, a soldier.
a loyal citizen and a man. He had a full ap
preciation of the responsibilities of hia posi
tion as an officer of the United States army.
His death Is a great loss to the army and a
personal loss to the large number of his com
rades In arms throughout the entire United
States, where he has hosts of friends. He was
amiable peaceful and quiet In times of peace
and warlike and soldierly in times of war. He
was a most efficient soldier. We all mourn his
loss. â¢ \
The death of Major Adams has
thrown the army headquarters into a
state of gloom. In every depart
mentfwere heard universal expres
sions' of regret at his sudden demise.
The funeral of Major Thomas R.
Adams, United States army, who -died
from injuries received when run
over by a Powell-street car several
days ago, will take place to-day at 3
o'clock from the First Congregational
Church. He will be buried with mili
tary honors befitting his rank. Gen

The golden wedding of Mr. and Mrs.
L. Friedman, who came to California
in 1862, will be celebrated on Sunday,
October 2, at their residence, 1222 Eddy
street, where they ' will receive their
friends.
To-morrow Captain. Rowan and his
well beloved bride ?will leave for Van
couver. What a round ot pleasure the
friends of the charming pair have given
them!
Of all who regret thÂ» loss of Mrs.
Rowan there are none who will miss
her as will her blind prqteges, they of
the library.
The wedding of Miss Ethel Thomp
son and Ray Washington Taylor oc
curred last evening at the bride's
home, 2021 California street. Bishop
Nichols officiated, assisted by Rev. Da
vid Hume of Trinity Church. Attend
ant upon the bride were her sisters, the
Misses Helen and Grace Thompson,
and her godmother, Mrs. William
Wood. The bridal gown was of white
mezzallne silk,' while that of the maid
of honor was of silk grenadine. The
drawing-room, wherein the ceremony
took place, was tastefully decorated
with white roses and rfbbon grass. The
dining-room was particularly attractive
in a mass of pink roses. Harold Thomp
son served as best man.
After the young people return from
their honeymoon they will set up their
household In this city.
A merry, merry lot of people went
over the bay last night to bid "god
speed" to Mrs. Alfred Hunter Voor
hies, Mrs. William B. Collier, Mrs. Mil
ton S. Latham, Mrs. E. B. Grace, 'liss
Lutie Collier, Mrs. A. Huntington md
others, who are journeying on to the
Exposition City, where the national
convention of the United Daughters of
Confederacy meet.
It is whispered that the members of
the Albert Sidney Johnston Chapter and
the Jefferson Davis Chapter have
agreed to a truce â and that the white
flag will fly while away from home.
Good scheme! If we must have a fam
ily jar, keep it within the family, as
internal strife destroys power and de
feats influence. And thus . are the
Daughters to be congratulated at the
burial of the ax.
Yesterday one of the largest lunch
eons of the year was given by Mrs. R.
P. Schwerin on board the steamship
Siberia, which is snugly tucked away
oh the drydock. One hundiod and
twenty-five guests were entertained at
the feastâ which was in truth a feast
of fun and good cheer. The tables
were engaged with a plenitude of red
blossoms and asparagus fern, and a
gay showing of gay gowning made a
striking picture.
After the luncheon Mrs. Schwerin
and a party of friends adjourned to the
St. Francis for dinner.
The hostess was very stunning In a
brown gown, with a red hat and red
roses, affording a fine foil to the fetch
ing gowns of Mrs. Katherlne Dillon
and the Misses Hager.

LONDON, Sept. 28. â Bubonic plague.
It is officially announced, has broken
out on board the steamship Bishops
gate, which arrived in the river Tyne
to-day from Hamburg.
When the Bishopsgate was discharg
ing her cargo from Rosario, Argentina,
at Hamburg recently, a number of rats
that had died of the plague were found
on board. On the arrival of the steam
er at Jarrow the boatswain was ill and
was removed to a floating hospital. The
case proved to be undoubtedly bubonic
plague.
The Bishopsgate, a steamer of 1994
tons, o.vned by the Dowgate Steamship
Company of London, sailed from Rosa
rio on July 22 for Hamburg, where she
arrived on August 29. While discharg
ing cargo three rats that had appar
ently died of bubonic plague were dis
covered, and the vessel was temporari
ly quarantined.
It was decided to send delegates to
the Transmississippi Commercial Con
gress, which will convenue in St. Louis
October 25, and to the National Irriga
tion Congress, which will meet at El
Paso, Texas, during the month of !No
vember. In view of the constantly in
creasing strategical importance of the
Pacific Ocean and the corresponding
necessity for the maintenance of a
large military force on this coast, the
association passed resolutions indors
ing the following recommendations of
General MacArthur to the War De
partment in his annual report:
The improvement of the Presidio by
the erection of new barracks and other
buildings for infantry, cavalry and field
and coast artillery; the reclamation of
a large flat along the bay shore, the
acquisition of .the watershed of Lobos
Creek with a view to the establishment
of an independent water supply for the
post; the continuation of the annual
appropriation of $15,000 for the im
provement of the Presidio grounds: the
erection of a depot for the quartermas
ter, subsistence and medical depart
ments and the enlargement of the ar
senal at Benicia, It was decided to send
the resolutions to all California mem
bers of Congress, to the Secretary of
War and to other commercial organi
zations of San Francisco.
At a meeting of the Manufacturers'
and'* Producers' Association held yes
terday it was decided to make a cam
paign for the use of California wood
and food products on the Isthmus of
Panama during the construction of the
canal. The plan of having a grand ex
cursion of Californians to Portland
during the Lewis and Clark Exposi
tion was Indorsed.
Emilio Velasco of Mexico and J. H.
Ralston of Washington. D. C. followed
with discussions of the subject pre
sented by Mr. Foster.
During the last session of the Bar
Association the special committee on
title and real estate reported that it
had not finished Its work and asked to
be continued another year. It was so
ordered. The report of the special
committee on the Louisiana Purchase
Exposition, relating to the arrange
ments completed preliminary to tha
meeting of the association, was re
ceived and approved.
Invitations for the^next annual
meeting were extend^* from Detroit
and Lookout Mountain, Tenn. Tha
matter of decision was left to the gen
eral
Officers elected for the next year
were: President, Henry St. peorge
Tucker, Lexington, Va., dean *t tfie
School of Law of the "Washington and
Lee University; secretary, John Hink
ley, Baltimore; treasurer. Frederick E.
Wadham, Albany, N. Y.. and one vice
president from each State, W. J. Hun
saker being California's representative.
The convention adjourned sine die.
ST. LOUIS, Sept. 23. â The first Uni
versal Congress of Lawyers and
Jurists, held the auspices the
American Bar Association, convened}
to-day in Festival Hall at the conclu
sion of the American Bar Association
convention. The president of the con
gress. David J. Brewer, Associate Jus
tice of the Supreme Court of the
United States, was greeted with an
ovation of applause. He spoke briefly.
Fcfmer Sei/etary tg State John W.Q
Foster made the principal address on
"International Arbitration and Tha
Hague Tribunal." He said in part:
It has been reported in the press that thÂ«
Secretary of the Navy has announced himself
as in favor of a navy equal to the sreateat
navy in the world. I trim he has been mis
quoted. Our Government should hold Itself
ready to enter Into an agreement for interna
tional disarmament and not to the increase of
tne navy! This country /^fiould hold Itself to>
other and far more pea><ul pursuits in ihÂ»
settlement of strife than to the making of im
plements of destruction and death.

France as saowa by. official figures had a
buoyant effect on soeculative prices here to
day. At the close December was up l%c. May
showed aa advance of %c Cora Is uo Uic.
Oats netted a sain of %c Provisions are
7 %c to 15c lower.
Indifference of foreign grain markets to an
advance here yesterday had a depressing ef
fect on wheat at the opening. Liberal re
ceipts !n the Northwest aided in bringing out
realizing *alet. Initial quotations on Decem
ber were eff %Â©%c. at $1 ll?sÂ©l 11 *i. ,
May opened Â»ifi%c lower, at $1 12%Â©1 12"&.
Immediately after the opening v the May optlca
touched $1 12%61 12%.- The market then
made a aulck rally. December sdvaaclag to
$1 12V*. and May to $1 13%. The sadden
change In sentiment was due to numerous
buying orders from Southwestern houses. The
demand was based opon an â¢ opinion reported
as prevailing la Kansas City and St. Louis
that a material reduction in receipts is im
pending:. On the bulre, realizing sales were
heavj' and the result wu an easier feeling,
and a. â¢ fractional â¢ decline. Later .in the day
sentiment in the pit became quite bullish. One
of tbe main Influences was the announcement
of the official figures on the wheat crbD In
France. According to this) estimate,' the total
yield shows a decrease of sixty-eight mlllloa
bushels' as compared with last year's crop.
Takins these figures as a basis, a well-known

Harrison's circular says: "Sine* the depart
ure of the steamship Sierra, there have been
the following coal deliveries from Australia,
namely: Ernest Reyer, 3100 toas; Weathers
field. 1490 tons; Ditton. 4180 tons; General Ne
grier. 2929 tons; Reaper. 1S26 tons; total. 13.
522 tons. There are seven cargoes of New
castle coal which are expected to arrive here
prior to November 1^ these seven, added to
the quantity now in yard, will be ample sop
ply for all local requirements for the next two
or three months. There are twenty-eight ves
sels ar present on the engaged list to transport
Australian coal here, with a carrying capacity
of 70,000 tons. Several of these cargoes will
not arrive here prior to the ead of the year.
Ia September. 1903, thirteen cargoes, carryiag
44,147 tons of Australian coal, were delivered
here. For the same time* this year we have had
but five arrivals from Newcastle with 13.522
tons. But few names of coal carriers are be
ing added to the loading list, partlaly because
the asking freight rate from Newcastle I* too
high, and the demand at this end Is dimin
ishing; the competition offered by our northern
coast collieries has served to cut down values
A*ry materially. The proximity of tte winter
months is already being felt and the domestic
foe! trade is becoming active; this will serve
to materially decrease the stocks of colonial
coal now on hand. Coal as a steam fnel is
gradually losing its hold amoag large consum

and there was a good demand from mills at |
previous premiums. The Southwest continues
to advise the probability of a decrease in the !
movement of -winter Wheat. The winter Wheat i
movement always decreases at this season, j
As a rule, very little or no accumulation of
stocks takes place out of the winter Wheat
movement. 'The spring Wheat movement is
fairly under way and likely to continue for
some weeks. The large speculative interest
and much of the previous source of good
speculative buying has been withdrawn from j
the market pending the result. Trie flour de
mand Is good and the present situation, so far !
as domestic conditions are concerned, is not |
an unhealthy one. It is all a question whether j
the domestic demand will be equal to the sup- i
ply for the next few weeks. We are a little
doubtful of it."

arrivals for the week show 5S0O tons. In com
parison with 3300 tons for the week preceding.
The railroad company has been spasmodically
delivering Hay. although there is still a large
amount of lt sidetracked throughout the coun
try, some of which has been loaded for sev
eral weeks. The Irregularity of arrivals,
coupled with the uncertainty as to what effect
the recent storm will have, hae caused consid
erable uneasiness to most of the handlers of
Hay here. There is still a large amount of Hay
out of doors, all of which will be damaged to a
greater or less extent. It may be that this
will be thrown on the market and sacrificed,
which will hurt the tone of the market mate
rially. On the other hand, it may be that
from this time on there will be a premium on
good, sound Hay. which may advance the mar
ket somewhat. It Is too early as yet to fore-
Judge this matter, so we will have to await
developments. From what we can learn, there
are yet about 3CD cars 'of Hay awaiting track
room here, so for the immediate future every
thing points toward a well supplied market
and no material change In prices. We can
note no improvement In the demand as far as
local trade goes, and nothing further has de
veloped'as yet In the line of foreign trade."

Receipts of Potatoes were heavy, being close

viously been bare and the demand continued
brisk; the recently advanced quotations were
well maintained and there was very little
stock left la first hands at the close. Onions
were dull at unchanged rates.
The market for miscellaneous vegetables was
in good shape and early arrivals of all de
scriptions moved off well at good prices. Good
Tomatoes were rathe r firm at 40 / s?Â«5Oc per box

Poultry and Game.
Fully two-thirds of the recent heavy receipt*
of Western Poultry were young chickens, which
sold ia preference to California young stock,
I thus causing an easier market for the latter.

chickens which showed any firmness. Ducks,
Geese and young Turkeys were quoted firm at

were 60 coops.' No Western came in.

Butter^ Cheese and Eggsl
' Butter is ' lower and quiet at the decline.
Stocks arc more than the market needs at
the noment and dealers generally complain of
tha slackness of. the demand.
The situation in Cheese is slowly but per
'Â¦ .-rptlbly improving, as stocks are lighter and
ths demauc Is somewhat better. Prices, how
ever show no advance.
The nu jority of the trade report a lower
market far Eggs. This Is not the time of the
year fcr E&S" to decline, and the tendency is
usually Just the other way. but there ia no
scarcity of stock and the public are using cold
storage ana Eastern to such an exte;:t that
ranch are being neglected. Receipts yesterday

Jrrreased the weakness.

There was Increased activity In all Hn=s of
fresh fruit, as the local demand was stimulated
by tfco warm, sunny weather, and a fair in
quiry was noted for shipment to Honolulu en
the steamers leaving to-day. Receipts of tab!.-
Grapes were moderate and sound dry lots sold
off well at good figures, while wet stock con
tinued to dwur. quotations for such offerlnzs
ranging from 25c to 50c per small box or crato.
Receipts of large open boxes were light, but.
owing to the difference in the slie of the boxe*.
quotations had a wide range. The Apple mar
ket bad a firm tone and the best offerings of
Gravenstein, Newtown' Pippins and Spitzenberg 1 '
were firmly held at higher rates. Trashy stock
was pretty well cleaned up. Â¦ Berries were in
light receipt and choice offerings met with
prompt . sale at good prices, while poor and
mudjXjr lots were weak at low rates. Melons
were in fair request, but supplies were still
excessive and as usual there was quite a sur
plus unsold at the close. A fair amount of
business was reported in Citrus and Tropical
fruits. Â¦<Â¦-.Â¦-Â¦ -
Deciduous and Citrus Fruits,
I foreign crop statistician made the claim that
! 32 000 OCO bushels of wheat will have to be
i imported Into France. The larger part of the
i imported srrain, it was asserted, will have to
be shluced from America. The domestic '
flour situation was an added stimulus to the
purchase of wheat. The high point on De- '
cember was reached at $1 13%. while May,
sold up to 51 14U- A reaction occurred later, t
I Hnal trading as a result of liberal liqui- j
j datlon, much of the gain being lost. The i
! close however, was firm, with December at i
j $1 12'V-. Final quotations on May were at j
â¢ $1 13%.. Clearances J of wneat - and flour were I
! equal to 16,200 bushels. Primary receipts were |
1.323,500 bushels, against 1,113,600 bushels a j
year ago. Minneapolis. Duluth and Chicago re- j
ported receicts of . 1062 cars, compared with [
67S cars last week and 656 cars a year ago. i
i During the early part of thÂ« session an easy |
tone Drevailed in the corn Dlt. but sentiment
experienced a radical change later In the day,
the market becoming decidedly strong. De
cember . ODened unchanged to %c lower, at
50?4Â©609.c, sold between 50%@51%c; and
closed at 51% c. Local receipts were 1Â»4 cars,
with 17 of contract rrade.
' The strength of corn was the main factor
in holding oats firm- - December opened a
! shade to %@Vio lower, at 30>4@30Â«ie to 30%@
i 3t>%c. ranged between 3OiÂ£Â©3O'?ic. and elosed
I at 30?ic. Local receipts were igc cars.
|" Provisions were weak in sympathy witb a
I decMne of 10c at the yards' and increased re-
I ceipts of hogs. There was considerable liqui

Merchants, retail dealers and others
whose business calls for the distribu
tion of catalogues, circulars and mer
chandise through the mail will be saved
much unnecessary labor and expense
by a new regulation of the Postoffice
Department which has just gone into
effect.
Under the old system when a busi
ness man desired . to send catalogues
through the mails he was obliged to
purchase specially canceled stamps
from the p stoffice. Under the new or
der, which applies only to "identical
packages" of third and fourth class
matter of a number not less than 2000,
the business man sends the catalogues
or other packages to the postofflce and
pays cash for the postage, thus saving
the time. and expense wasted. In placing
a one or two cent stamp on each pack
age. The articles thus go through the
mails unstamped. .
The first applicant in this city to
avail himself of the new order was
Registrar George P. Adams,, who is
sending 75,000 sample ballots through
the malls. All the time required here
tofore to affix a stamp to each of the
75,000 envelopes and the expense of so
doing will be saved the city.
The new order applies to all classes
of mail matter excepting sealed letters
and periodicals.

It is *.s "The Office Boy" that Daniels
will make his bow to a San Francisco
audience next week, and there is every
reason to believe that' local theater
goers will receive a treat..
Daniels first came into prominence
by his impersonation of Old Sport in
Hoyt's "A Rag Baby," and became a
leading member of Hoyfs companies.
He next appeared on his own account
in "Little Puck," a dramatization of
Anstey's "Vice-Versa." Mr. Daniels
then became leading comedian in Wil
lard Spencer's "Princess Bonnie." He
was so successful that the next season
he made his debut as a star in "The
Wizard of the Nile." .'This was fol
lowed successively by an "Idol's Eye,"
"The Ameer" and "Miss Simplicity," in
all of which he achieved great popu
larity.
This season Mr. Daniels has as man
ager Charles B. Dillingham, formerly
manager for Julia Marlowe, who has
secured for his star a first-class comic
opera in "The Office Boy."
At the Colombia, next Monday night,
Frank Daniels will appear in the mu
sical comedy entitled "The Office Boy."
This will be the first, opportunity for
Columbia audiences to enjoy a play in
which Daniels appeared all last year in
the East, and which may be said to be
the crowning triumph of his theatrical
career.

The!weak point in th'e.woraan's story
is that she. turned over the money to
Venzimr in Mexican dollars. ' The
weight of the coin would be a load for
a strong dray horse. .Venzina will be
held pending investigation of the case.
The' 1 woman maintains that she
turned her money over' to him on Oc
tober 10, 1903, shortly after her arrival
from Mexico.
When he obtained possession of the
coin, Venzina disappeared, so the
woman claims. The money also disap
peared with him, and Senorita Silva
was broken-hearted.
"Dear me," she moaned, "after all his
promises! He said that he would
marry me when his wife died. He
went away with my pesos and the wife
who should have died grows fat.",
Venzina was arrested while in a bar
ber's chair in the Grand Hotel. He
has only recently returned from Ari
zona, where, it is alleged, he has
been soandering the 7000 pesos belong
ing, to Senorita Silva. He was placed
in the tanks at the City Prison, and his
name entered on the detinue book.
Venzina de Venzina, a Mexican, was
arrested by Detectives O'Dea and Mul
cahey last night. On October 10, 1903,
although he had a wife living, he pronr
ised to marry a woman named Rafaela
Sllva, according to the statements of
the latter. The woman claims that
she turned over to him at that time
$7000 in Mexican dollars.
The immigrants for whom better ac
commodations are needed are princi
pally the Chinese and improvement is
the more urgent because of the long
time they must frequently be held
pending examination under the exclu
sion law. In sdme cases several months
elapse before a' decision is rendered
as to the claims to entry and during
this time the petitioner must remain
in the quarters that have been con
structed at the Pacific Mail dock un
der the rafters. The place is frequent
ly overcrowded and, while every pre
caution is taken for health and the best
care given that is possible, the condi
tions are not what they should be and
legislation for the erection of a com
modious building and provision for'ac
commodations such as obtain on Ellis
Island in New York is expected from
Congress.
Often Commissioner North has been
compelled to seek the aid of the Chris
tian missions in Chinatown for the care
of the women immigrants. While there
is a separate department for them in
the shed at the dbck it is not a desir
able place for detention for any length
of time.
BETTER QUARTERS NEEDED.
Others accompanying the Secretary
on his trip to the dock and to Angel
Island were Collector of the Port F. S.
Stratton, Deputy Collector W. B. Ham
ilton, Major Devoll, J. A. Folger,
Thomas Rickard, 'R. P. Schwerin, H.
H. Schell and Walter J. Matthews. The
party was conveyed in the tug Golden
Gate and almost the entire day was
consumed in the important work of the
Secretary.
Matthews is an Architect of Oakland
and his advice was sought by Secretary
Metcalf as to the most favorable site
for the immigrant station on Angel Is
land. The architect will assist in mak
ing estimates of the cost of building
the quarters. ThÂ£ report is to be ready
in time for presentation at the coming
session of Congress.
When Secretary Metcalf saw the
papers in the case he ordered them
landed forthwith. The proceeding took
place in the presence of the entire
party and while not a word of com
ment was spoken the situation was
painful to North until attention was
diverted to Other matters.
Incidentally, during his visit to the
detention shed at the Pacific Mail dock,
where 130 Chinese are confined, the
Secretary gave . a severe rebuke' to
Commissioner of Immigration Hart H.
North, who was one of the party ac
companying him. Metcalf found among
the imprisoned, crowd Fong Kao and
Yen Fook Yeong with regular certifi
cates, as required by section 6, certify
ing that they were merchants on the
way to the St. Louis fair. Fong had
sold his business in Canton for $3800
and North and his assistant, Charles
Mehan, had denied him landing be
cause they held he could no longer be
regarded as a merchant. Yen had also
sold out and was denied entry.
i STERN REBUIvC FOR NORTH.
Victor H. Metcalf, Secretary of Com
merce and Labor, made investigation
of the need of an immigrant statio-n
for this port and inspected a proposed
site for' the building on. Angel Island
yesterday. The Cabinet representative
was acting in accordance with a resolu
tion passed by Congress at. its last ses
sion directing him to ascertain what is
required for a station in San Francisco
and how much it will cost.
The accommodations for caring for
immigrants on their arrival pending
examination and for those who are
detained longer are very meager, crude
"detention sheds" being the most the
port can boast of, and Congress wished
to gain some information as to the con
ditions with a view to making an ap
propriation for providing proper quar
ters.
This decision given by the Supreme j
Court also held that such money, af- j
ter being awarded to the State as a i
result of the s=uit, was still subject to j
the right of resident citizen heirs to i
claim the money before the expiration j
of twenty years from the time it es
cheated to the State. There is some i
division of legal opinion as to the j
rights of foreign heirs. Some lawyers j
maintain that they are limited to five I
years in which to file claims upon es- ;
cheated estates; others say the for- â¢
eign heirs are allowed the full twenty ;
years under the decision.
Another feature of the escheat fund i
case is the fact that a few years ago
the Stiite. by special act of the Legis- :
lature. borrowed $80,000 from the es- i
cheat fujad to apply to the school I
fund. This money has never been re- I
turned and the State has probably â¢
used the money. No difficulty is ex- i
pected. however, as it is not likely j
that many of the heirs to the escheat
ed estates will ever demand their in
heritance. ;
By a ruling of the Supreme Court .
it was decided that no money had es- (
cheated to the State through the de
cisions of the Probate Courts and that
the State would . iiave to sue the j
Treasurer to obtain^ possession of the ,
money. This ruling was made by the j
Supreme Court in the case of James Â¦
Minor vs. the State. The case, con- j
ducted by John T. Houx. consur-.ed j
three years in reaching a decision and
decided a legal question that had j
never before been considered. This
was that the mere declaration by the ,
Probate Court that there are no heirs
to an estate did not constitute a judg- i
ment of escheat to the State and that Â¦
such judgment must be obtained on }
behalf of the estate by the Attorney j
General. â¢ !

ler.
The attorneys will start to work at
once, as there is a great deal to be
done to clear the State"s books. Sep
arate suits for each amount must be
brought. There are nearly 2000 es
tates whose money lies in the State
treasury and the amounts range from
40 cents uu to $2000.
Since the admission of California
into the Union there has been accu
mulating in the State treasury an
amount of money approximated at
$200,000. This money is made up of
sums that have escheated to the State
owing to the failure of heirs to claim
their due and has been paid into the
treasury by order of the Probate
courts in the different counties of the
State.
