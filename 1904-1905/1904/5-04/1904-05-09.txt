BRISTOL, . Tenn., May 8.â Reliable
information from Wise County, Vir
ginia, to-night tells of the finding of
the body of Edward' Leisenring Wentz,
the young Philadelphia X: millionaire,
who disappeared on October 14 last^
After several months' search in which
the number, of searchers was never, less
than one hundred and sometimes more
than one . thousand, and after many
thousands of dollars had been expended
It has all resulted in the discovery that
instead of being held for. ransom the
young man was 1 killed .after lie
was captured ,by unknown /men near
Stony Gap, Tenn. -
1 That the searchers were nearing the
end of their work was generally be
lieved, last. Friday, when,lin examining
the cabin of two outlaws under arrest
on a charge of robbery, the Sheriff's
deputies came upon a pair of "riding
breeches, finely made and of fashion
able cut. As no one but ' Wentz had
ever, been known to wear such things
in the mountains of the three States,
It was ' at once Inferred that the end
of. the Wentz ' mystery was in sight
and the search was Â¦ redoubled. '

Edward Leisenring of Pennsylvania, a

dozen years ago' 150,000 acres of land.
This â¢ land had never been sold before
and 'the titles were still in doubt. The
residents were determined squatters,
resisting all attempts at eviction.
Leisenring died and his sister's sons;
D. B. and Edward Wentz, went there
to manage the property interests. Busi
ness .development meant a disruption
of, the squatter farms and out of that
grew, an, enmity which was >alw*y3

Sims told the story In confidence to

gave it to the public.
As the story' goes, when National
Secretary C. A. Walsh and Commlt
teeman Johnson of the Democratic
National Committee first came to
Indianapolis to open Hearst headquar
ters Sims was one of the first men
sent for. They took him up into a
room in the Claypool Hotel and un
folded to him how he migrht be thÂ©
Democratic nominee for Governor of
Indiana and have all the money he
wanted to make his ! campaign if lie
would lend, his name and brains to
their cause.
Sims did not name the amount, but
It is said to have been $250,000. If
he carried- th* State -far. Hearst ha
was to receive the nomination for
Governor on the Democratic ticket
and he was also to receive $250,000 to
defray the expenses of his campaign.
Sims refused the proposition.
J. O. Henderson, Hearst's Indiana
manager, said to-night:
"If such a thirrg: was done it was be
fore I became connected with the
bureau here."
INDIANAPOLIS, May 8. â The talk
of Indiana to-night is the charge
made by Daniel W. Sims of Lafayette
that he received the offer of an enor
mous sum from the Hearst managers
to organize the Democracy of Indiana
in the. interest of Hearst. He is recog
nized everywhere for honesty and un
blemished character and every one be
lieves him.
Sims said that early in the cam
paign he was called to Indianapolis to
attend a meeting in the interest of
Hearst. J. K. Risk, editor of the
Lafayette Democrat, was there. Sims
was asked to take the management
of the Hearst boom in Indiana and
was promised a large sum if he would
do so.

\ A massive pold seal, worth intrinsic
ally R*000 and one of the priceless treas
urer of an ancient Chinese dynasty
â¢ has been offered for sale in this c\ty.
The first report stated that it was of
fered for sale to the Selby Smelting
Works by a. person that represented
himself to be an officer of the Italian
warship Lignria. now in port.
__ Subsequent denials to this report
jvcre rnade by President Ralston of the
J: melting Company, who stated that i
Each a piece of gold was offered for |
i sale to his company by a man whose
&an:e he could not recalL All he could
refcember was that the man that of
fered the gold seal for sale had a son-
In-lzw* named Engene McCarthy. The
latter could not be found last night to
, tell who his father-in-law is.
The ofTer of sale of the precious relic
was made la^t Friday afternoon by the
ur.nan-iod man and the cashier looked Jt
ngtnfully 'over. .To h;<? practiced eye it
I-Ailced. c^ though It was more than
twenty carats 2ne and upon its fa.ee
At Yi,ve what appeared to be Chinese
'characters. The unknown vendor was
t^;ld to come the following: day for the
results of the test, when he would re
ceive his money.
Word was sent to the Chinese Consul
General by the Selby Smelting- Com
pany on Saturday morning 1 , after all
.fl;e experts of the company had viewed
the .gold r ec-al offered for sale. They
cv-clacfd that it was of great antiquity
nr.d fashioned into its present form by
emiths that must have died ever 4000
years ago.
VALUABLE RELIC.
The Chinese Consul General went
to the office cf the Selby Smelting Com
pany at once. As soon es he sawÂ»the
seal be-deciphered the worn Inscriptions
upon it and declared that it was one of
the most valuable relics of an
encient Chinese dynasty. He said
the gold came from the gTeat
range of the Khinga Mountains
e*d # the sands of the Gobi Desert
and 'was gathered by hand from the
Yocks and channels more than 4000
years ago.
Melted and refined into a solid mass,
the artisans of those ages carved the
Inscriptions upon the grold that have
Â¦formed the official seal of the dynasty
imr thousands cf years, until more mod
ern times ar.d a greater sway caused a
new imperial seal to be developed. Then
the seal m delegated to the nearest
rephew cf the Emperor as his official
signature.
The Chinese Consul General was not
to be seen yesterday or last nlgnt. His
Secretary stated that on Saturday
morning a white man called upon the
Consul General with a message and
that his chief left the office imme
diately. That was all the secretary
knew.
SECRECY PREVAILS.
The eecretary of the Selby Smelting
V. r orkB enly knew that a brick had been
cJTered answering to the seal and its
Inscriptions outlined above. "It has
passed out of our possession now," he
caid. "and I must refer you to Presi
dent Hasten for further information."
â¢â¢When President Ralston was found
at his hom* In Berkeley he said:
"Such a seal as you describe was of
f ereJ to our company by a man whose
name I now forget. He was not a na
val officer and not connected with the
Italian warship Llguria. His son-in
law is named Eugene McCarthy. He
told us that the article he offered had
been secured in one of his trips to the
Orient, and he had grown tired of it
end wanted to cell It. Before we had
tested its value his wife came to our
oHlce and demanded the gold seal back.
That "1st how it passed out of our pos
session."
There are many 6tories current about
the offer to sell this seal. One Is that
the Chinese Consul General has guar
anteed the payment of $10,000 for it,
Â¦u hit-to is twice its intrinsic value if
.melted up. "

exposure of the armor plate fraud was
sensational, and a lengthy inquiry fol
lowed, which conclusively proved
crookedness on the part of the contrac
tor, and gross carelessness of the naval
officers who inspected the material.
The contractors, however, were fined
only a nominal sum; the negligent offi
cers were not even reprimanded, nor
web the defective armor removed from
the ships, and the location of every bad
plate is as well known to every Navy
Department abroad as it is known in
Washington.
The submarine, which for several
years after the unsatisfactory experi
ments with the Nordenfeldt and others

that there are seventy-one of these

three projected. These boats are dis

quest was retired. He entered the Civil

As two of the three guns "provision

muzzles, the third gun made out of-de
fective material no doubt will bs taken
off the ship on which It has .been
placed. As to the responslbilty. for
these defective guns, the dispatch'
.states: "The company worked to have
the forgings accepted by the depart
ment and finally succeeded. Both guns
blew off their muzzles. H. A. Herbert
was Secretary of the Navy at , the
time." The chief of bureau at that
time was Captain W. T. Sampson and
Commander T. F. Jewell was superin
tendent of the gun foundry from Jan
uary, 1893, to February: 10,. 1896. The
latter wa3 succeeded by : E. H. C.
Lentze. serving until April 10,. 1896,
when relieved by Charles â¢ O'Neil, who
remained in charge up.- to- June. 1, 1897,
when he became chief of the Bureau of
Ordnance. Lieutenants "W.L. Rodgers,
J. H. Moore. R. F. Nicholson and F. E.
Greene, in the order named, had super
vision over the manufacture of S-inch
guns from December, 1892, to January,
1800, and the reports,' no doubt, show
under which particular â¢ officer these,
defective but "provisionally accepted"
forgings were made into ordnance and
put on board the warships.
During 1894-95 the Bureau of Ord
nance was unfortunate, not alone In
having bad gun forgings thrust 'upon
It, but also In getting inferior , armor
Xor the shipB under construction. The
many of these forgings have developed,
during machining, spots and flaws due
apparently to sand or slag in the Ingot.

flaws take the form of splits. â¢ Â¦ â¢ â¢â¢
The number of these flaws varies in
different pieces, but even those which
are apparently sound are discredited
by the others, and it is ' a question
whether the whole lot should not be re
jected." In the next report, dated Sep
tember 14, 1SS5. Commander T. F. Jew
ell, superintendent of the gun foundry,
stated: "Of the sixteen sets of forg
4ngs ordered from the Midvale Com
pany, it became necessary to reject all
of the tubes and all but two of the
Jackets, on account of the small flaws
described In the last report. Three
tubes, replacing rejected ones, although
not entirely free from defects, have
been provisionally accepted during the
year.. One gun from these forglnge has
been completely assembled, and I the
other two tubes" have been jacketed."
During the succeeding year, seventeen
8-inch guns were completed at .the
foundry. Sixteen pf these' guns w'ere
for the Broc-klyn and Iowa." Those for
the Brooklyn were tested and shipped,
but the Iowa's complement was ' not
filled until early in 1897. after being
tested at the naval proving grounds,
none of the guns showing any sign of
weakness according to report of Com
mander A. R. Couden, In charge of the
proving grounds.

Brander's column returns to Gyangtse
to-morrow, where its first work will be
the capture of Jong, which the Ti
betans have occupied.
Our casualties were eighteen, Includ
ing five killed. Among the latter, to
the universal regret, is Captain Beth
une, who fell while leading his men to
attack on the wall.
The construction of the wall and the
choice of the spot where it was bull*,
reflect credit upon the Tibetans, so
I much so that its abandonment must
have been due to sheer cowardice, as it
/would have been almost impossible to
take it by frontal attack, the enemy
largely using Lassa-made rifles and
cartridges, instead of matchlocks.
The general plan of attack was an
outflanking movement by one company
of Gurkans and a direct attack by
pioneers. Ultimately it was found
necessary to detach a small force oC
pioneers to scale a precipice 1200 feet
high. The enemy then ran.
The gallantry of both Sikhs and pio
neers on either flank was most con
spicuous, as the resistance was stub
born until the flank3 were turned.
When that occurred the entire Tibetan
force fled to the wall, though they were
almost unscathed.
The casualties of the Tibetans dur
ing the actual flgh\ were about seven
ty-five, and probably as many again
were lost by try* pursuit by the mount
ed Infantry, who have not yet returned.
CAPTAIN* BETHUXE'S DEATlf.
The enemy, after obstinate resist
ance, were cleared from the wall. Two
sangers, well defended, held back the
advance two and a half hours, dur
ing most of which time a pelting hail
storm was In progress.
Among the special features of the in
cident it is noteworthy that the attack
was delivered shortly after the Karola
force had moved out, proving that the
Tibetans had considerable forewarning
of our Intended action.
The Tibetans still remain in force and
have occupied Jong, 1900 yards away,
whence they are carrying on an inef
fectual bombardment of the mission
with jinglea.
When Colonel Brander with his rifles
camped here on the pass last night.
16,000 feet up, the enemy, numbering
1600, were holding a wall three miles
ahead. Their position was well flanked
by sangers and elaborate preparations
had been made for hurling down rocks
from both sides of the gorge. Seven
hundred of the men were from Kamas
and the remainder from Lassa and this
locality.'
TROOPS SCALE . PRECIPICE.
The garrison, under command of Ma
jor Murray, behaved with great gallan
try and beat off the attack successful
ly, although the pick of the men and
nearly all of the Benior officers had been
taken for the Karola expedition.
NATIVES WELL INFORMED.
News reached here this morning from
Gyangtse of a battle there yesterday In
which the Tibetans had 200 killed and
80 wounded. The latter are now be
ing treated at the Mission Compound.
The battle at Gyangtse was the out
come of an attack on Colonel Young
husband and his escort at early dawn
on Thursday by 800 men from Dongtse.
The attacking force arrived at Gyang
tse at midnight, the approach being
made with the utmost secrecy.
- NEW YORK, May 8.â The Times has
the following cablegram from Karo
Pass, Tibet: May 6 (via Kalatso May
8).â Colonel Brander with three hun
dred rifles and about two-thirds of the
Gyangtse garrison, reached here yes
terday, after' three days' marching, the
purpose of the journey being to dis
perse a body of Tibetans who were sta
tioned here to oppose the progress of
Colonel Younghusband's mission. The
Tibetans were put to flight to-day, los
ing 150 killed and wounded. The Brit
ish casualties totaled 18, including five
killed.

DEFIvCTIVK YA.VKEE GUNS.
On April 1 the dockyards of Great
Britain were building eight armored
ships of 115,700 tons, and one cruiser
of oSOO tons, making a total of nine
vessels of 125.000 tons. At private
yards sixty-one vessels of 214.845 tons
were under construction, of which
thirteen of 167,^50 tons were armored
ships, the others embracing eleven
cruisers, twenty-four torpedo boats and
thirteen submarines. For foreign na
virs only four vessels of 36.770 tons were
building, which included the two bat
tleships for Japan, a Turkish cruiser of
SS30 tons and a email cruiser of 540
tons. Orders from foreign Governments
-arc becoming scarcer every year in
England and the present building of
battleships for Japan will probably be
the last order from that country. Every
naval power of any note is building its
Ehips at home . yards and there is a
keen competition between England,
.France. Germany and Italy for acci
dental naval work at prices which
would have received no attention a few
yrars ago.
The first of the eight "scouts" build
ing for the British navy was launched
at Vicker's Sons and Maxim's yard.
Barrow-in-Furness, on April 18. She
Is named the Sentinel and her keel was
laid June 8. 19B3. The dimensions of
these vessels vary somewhat, with
fcJfKht differences in displacement from
ZSSG to 2900 tons, but the contract speed
of twenty-five knots is stipulated from
the four firms which are building two
vessels each. The dimensions of the
Sentinel are SCO feet length, 40 feet
breadth, 14 feet 2 inches mean draught
a*nci 2S50 tons displacement. The cal
culated horsepower is 17.000, and the
normal coal carried is only 150 tons,
with a bunker capacity of 2S0 tons.
These vessels may be classified like the
Xcviks in the Russian navy, as im
proved torpedo boat destroyers, in
which speed alone is the object aimed
at and their aiynament is only sufficient
to engage torpedo craft. The battery
is composed of ten 12-pounders. eight
3-pounders and two torpedo launching
tubes. They will have a complement
of 268 officers and cre%v and the es
timated cost of the Sentinel, including
guns, is $1,408,000.
ENGLAND'S N'EAV SCOUTS.
Japan's navy officials evidently do
not share the opinion of some naval
critic? that the huge battleships built
during the past twenty years are fail
urrs and will be eliminated in future
jiJtval construction. The two battlt
ships contracted for by Japan in Eng
land are the largest yet built for any
r.avy. having a normal displacement
of 16,4 00 tons, which Is 50 tons more
than the five ships of the King Edward
VII class, building for the British
navy, and 400 tons larger than the
Connecticut class of five ships in the
United States navy. Olfkial details as
to dimensions and armament have
been given out by the builders at Els
wick, which show that the new ships
are practically duplicates, except as to
length of the latest British battle
ehips. Their length is 4j5 feet (2S
fett longer than the King Edward),
7S feet beam .ind 26 feet 74 inches
mean draught. The greater length
with the same breadth and draught as
the British ships insures finer lines
and will undoubtedly enable the Jap
anese vessel to attain the calculated
Fpeed of 1M* knots, with 18,000 horse
power, with greater ease than the
fhort^r ship. The maximum thickness
of armor b*lt is 9 inches and the pro
tective deck over engine spaces and
magazines 2 inches to Z inches. The
armament will be of four 12-inch in
two barbettes, four 10-inch in single
barbettes.- twelve 6-inch in _ citadel,
twelve 12 -pounders, six Maxims, three
S-pounders and five torpedo launching
tubes. The axis of the 12-inch guns
is _6 feet above the normal water line,
the 10-im-h guns 22 feet and the
6-inch guns from 13 to 14 feet. Steam
is to be supplied by twenty N'iclausse
boilers placed in three compartments
and the total bunker capacity is 2000
tons.
The new Japanese explosive, Shl
mose, named after its inventor. Is al
leged to have been used wlth v great
effect in the recent naval engagements.
It is nearly as powerful as blasting
gelatine and can be handled with ab
solute safety. Its destructive power
Has been demonstrated in many ex
periments, one of which was the plac
ing of a small quantity on a thick iron
plate and exploding it, resulting in the
perforation of the plate over ah area
covered by the powder. In another
instance a sir-inch Shimose shell was
fired against a target representing the
armored section of a vessel. The pro
jectile made a hole about three feet
in diameter, whereas the ordinary shell
made a hole only six inches In di

ST. PETERSBURG, May 8. â The
only gleam of brightness in the dark
cloud overshadowing the East lies in
the official Information from General
Pflug that Port Arthur is not' yet
blocked by the Japanese. How this
Information was obtained the officials
will not say, but they insist that it is
reliable and are satisfied that the de
fenders will prevent the success of the
further efforts which the Japanese un
doubtedly will make to "bottle" the
harbor. ,
LONDON, May 9.â In an %ccount of
the Kuliencheng battle, the Daily Mail
correspondent says:
"The moonlight broke into a splendid
dawn and revealed the Japanese army
drawn up as if on parade."
Then, after describing the shelterless
nature of the plain dividing the oppos
ing armies, the Daily Mail's account
proceed:
"The Russians did not respond to the
opening Â«f the Japanese fire, but re
mained silent and invisible. The Jap
anese line of infantry, miles long and
entirely exposed, advanced from point
to point, by swift, sudden rushes,
smartly executed in the most brilliant
style, firing steadily all the while. We
watched anxiously, excepting that each
rush would enter the zone of fire.
"The Japanese were working around
the sides of Kuliencheng Bay to their
position when the Russian trenches
suddenly poured a hurricane of rifle
fire into them with deadly effect. For
a moment the Japanese advance weak
ened and recoiled, then rallied and once
more went forward across the stream,
obtaining some shelter. in a dead angle
under the base of the mountain. The
Russians, not having guns, were unable
to reply to the continuous fire of the
Japanese artillery. The Japanese ad
vance was now marked by prostrate
bodies. In one instance two Japanese
shells did terrible execution among
their own men who were ascending the
slope.
"Two hours after the advance began
an officer suddenly appeared at the top
of the slope, waving a large Japanese
flag, sending an electric thrill through
the beholders, all far and near shouting
'Banzai.' "
According to the Standard's corre
spondent, the Russians put into action
only two batteries. It is reported that
they had with them 120 guns, including
eighty field guns and twenty quick
firers.
The Times correspondent under date
of May 8 says:
"The celerity and organization of the
recent Japanese movements Is remark
able. The second army, which began to
embark a fortnight ago. evidently re
mained at its base, pending the results
of the Yalu operations. If these had

The Rusians apparently welcomed
the correspondent as an evidence that
there will be active .campaigning soon,
which was in signal contrast with the
correspondent's observations at Port
Arthur when the war opened, as the
correspondents there were regarded as
harbingers of evil and as being un
desirable on account of the war.
The lavish equipment of the railroad

all the rest of the equipment being of

lighted tables in the crowded dining
rooms, discussing the meager news
which may have eluded the official

News of the progress of the war in
the regions to the west and south and

on the main line after leaving New
chwang and received official courtesies
on the Journey.
Observations from the car window
were unique. The spectacle in many
places of artillery parks amid the
springing wheat and Cossacks lining
the road entirely changed the aspect of
Central Manchuria since the corre
spondent's departure from headquart
ers at Port Arthur more than two
months ago.
Notwithstanding the extensive mili
tary occupation of, and operations in
the eastern region, the country here
presents a singularly peaceful appear
ance. The farmers and natives appar
ently are undisturbed and are profiting
by the advance in the prices of pro
ducts.
The foreign guests of the Russian
authorities in Manchuria note the
business-like conduct of the war and
also the absence of excitement and are
surprised at the machine-like operation
of the railway.

LIAOTANG, May 8.â The first lot of

here yesterday. They were on a sani
tary train and are receiving careful
attention by medical officers. General
Kuropatkin was on the train, chatting
with the -\\-ounded. He distributed a
number of medals for gallantry in ac
tion.- Colonel Maister and Captain Fll
adeloff, who were among the wounded,
were interviewed by a correspondent,
to whom they made the following state
ment:
"Without fear of the enemy's artil
lery, on April 29, the Russians began
to prepare for battle. The Second Bat
tery and the Sixth "Brigade occupied
the Kullencheng position. On April 30
twelve of the enemy's three-Inch guns
appeared suddenly on an island oppo
site Kullencheng and then the battle
began. The enemy shot bravely, their
shrapnel bursting over our heads. In
a few hours our battery was destroyed":
by the enemy, who opened with how
itzers, which could not be seen, this
tending to demoralize /our men.
"Our ammunition was quickly ex
hausted and it was necessary in the
middle -of the battle to Issue a new
supply. All around shells were bursting
and splinters \Vere flying in every di
rection. Captain Shounkoff, under a
heavy fire, rushed 'forward and closed
the ammunition box. which otherwise
might have been exploded by the ene
my's shells, and then returned to the
battery.
"It was an awful one-sided battle
and lasted all day. Our, battery lost
heavily. Its horses were killed and we
wereSinable to withdraw the guns, and
we, therefore, destroyed and abandoned
them." ,
Captain Tickorjevsky,, an artillery
man. said: â¢ . . ; .'.

KUROPATKIN' GIVES MEDAI&
The name of the priest of the Elev
enth Regiment who led the gallant
charge and who was among the wound
ed is Tcherbackoffsky of the orthodox
Greek church.
General Kuropatkin says that no pris
oners were taken by the Japanese. He
admits that seven officers and 679 men
were left on the field, but it Is not
known whether they were wounded or
dead.
The casualties show that one-fifth of
General Zassulitch's command was
placed out of action. The Eleventh and
Twelfth regiments lost mere than half
their men in the fight. The third bat
tery of the Third Artillery Brigade
was almost annihilated, losing eighty
eight men killed or wounded and sev
enty-two out of 110 horses.
The second battery of the Sixth Bri
gade lost forty-four in killed or wound
ed and 108 out of 110 horses. The third
batten" of the Sixth Brigade lost twen
ty-four killed or wounded and forty
one horses. Of the machine gun detach
ment only twenty-six were not killed
or wounded.
"In consequence of the heavy losses
In men and battery horses and the dif
ficulties encountered in the country, it
was Impossible to bring away the guns
and machine guns.
"The Eleventh and Twelfth regi
ments, notwithstanding their losses,
were reformed in good order ujider the
protection of the Third Rifle Division,
which did not participate in the fight,
but which was brought up to cover the
retreat."
The list enables an exact statement
of the forces under General Zassulitch.
which were made up exclusively of
Eastern Siberians and included the
Ninth, Tenth, Eleventh, Twelfth and
Twenty-second regiments, a battalion
of the Twenty-fourth Regiment, all the
riflemen of the third battery of the
Third Artillery Brigade, the second and
third batteries of the Sixth Artillery
Brigade, the second company of Sibe
rian sappers and a machine gun de
tachment of the Third Rifle Brigade.
General Kuropatkin does not give the
strength of the Japanese, only report
ing that It was five times greater than
and far superior in artillery to the Rus
sian forces.
General Zassulitch confirms the re
ports of the enormous mortality among
the artillery horses and concludes his
report as follows:
â¢'Our losses on April SO and May 1 al
together amounted to seventy superior
and subaltern officers and 2327 killed,
wounded or taken prisoners. Of thia
total 10S1 were left on the battlefield,
but it is not known whether they were
killed or wounded.
ST. PETERSBURG, May 8.â The
Emperor has received a dispatch from
General Kuropatkin giving the report
of Lieutenant General Zassulitch of the
Russian losses in the battle of Kulleu
cheng. The report states that Major
General Kashtalinsky was injured in
the head by a stone. The brunt of the
fighting, General Zassulitch says, was
borne by the Eleventh and Twelfth
Rifle regiments and the Twenty-second
Regiment. The fighting was so dei
perate that the Russian regiments
were obliged to make several counter
attacks to cut a way for themselves
with the bayonet against the enemy,
who was far stronger than the Rus
sians and was supported by very nu
merous artillery.
In this fight, so terrible but glorious
for the Eleventh and Twelfth regi
ments, the losses in killed were four
officers, including the commander of
the Eleventh, and 4S1 non-commission
ed officers and men. ;The wounded were
one officer and S01 non-commissioned
officers and men and a chaplain, while
seven hundred others were left on the
field.
Russians here will not talk of the
situation, for fear that they may im
part some information. They do not
consider that their forces here are suf
ficient to hold this section of the coun
try. It is probable that the Russian
troops will withdraw to Harbin.
The Russian civilians at Newchwang
are leaving hurriedly, and many na
tives are fleeing the city In the fear
that they will be subjected to mal
treatment at the hands of the brigands.
It is reported here that VIcerojr Alex
leff was slightly wounded prior v to his
departure from Port Arthur. He barely
escaped from there before the Japanese
closed the lines of communication.
The Russian general staff has moved
from Uaoyang to Mukden.
NEWCHWANG, May 7. 9 p. m.â
There is every indication that the
Russians have decided to evacuate
Newchwang. Troops have been leav
ing here all day long. The forts have
been dismantled, and all the artillery
has been placed on board trains. AH
of the local transportation has been
commandered by the Russian authori
ties. _ â¢ . .
There Is current here a native rumor
that*the Japanese " transports are in
Fuchow Bay (on the west side of.thft
Liaotung Peninsula, and about sixty
miles north of Port Arthur), but this
report lacks confirmation. . â¢ â¢â¢
The fear is held here that If thÂ» Rus
sians . leave and the Japanese do not at
once take possession of Newchwang
the brigands, who are now across the
river r near, TInkow, will Â¦ pillage . the
place.' The foreign residents are pre
pared to resist the brigands . should
they come over. The British Consul
has requested that a gunboat be sent
to Newchwang. v
, The Russians probably will destroy
the gunboat Slvoutch before leaving.
The vessel is at Newchwang.
- Japanese troops fired upon what
probably was the last train out of
Port Arthur as it passed near Port
Adams. They used artillery and small
arms and , killed or wounded several
Chinese. ,- , â¢
The demonstration was held in
honor of the victories achieved by the
Japanese army and navy.
Tens of thousands of persons, car
rying lanterns, flags and banners,
marched. past the imperial palace and
the offices of the Foreign, War and
Navy departments. At the Navy De
partment they were reviewed by some
of the Imperial Princes and Princesses
and high officials of the Government
and the imperial household.
Many bands of music accompanied
the marchers and there were beautiful
displays of fireworks. Dozens of
American and British- flags were car
ried by men, women and children who
participated in the celebration.
It was the greatest demonstration
ever witnessed In Japan.
TOKIO, May 8. â During the pop
ular demonstration last night in Jionor
of the victories achieved by the Jap
anese forces twenty-one persona were
killed and forty injured. The killed
and injured were mostly boys, who
were caught against a closed gate at
an angle in the old palace walls by the
throng and crushed or drowned in an
old moat.

conscientious work among the athletes of the

ty PreFldent Wheeler. Colonel George C. Ed

etr.lor in the college of social science. The
rneCal that will be given Sncdlgar Is the gift
of Arthur W. North of the clans of '93. It
will be preiKTited to him on class day.
Owing to the fact that the bids for the grad-
Ing cf the Hlllrgast tract for the new football
fi'Id are much higher than It was thought
they would be the special committee In charge
of the bids is trying to modify the plan* ao
that the cost will come within the evUmate.
The lowest bid for the grading was JHJ.4V>.
which ie altogether beyond the amount figured
upon by th* executive committee of the Aa
rociatrd Students. The bleachers are to cost
from $7000 to *S00O. so the entire cost will

STRAINS OF MUSIC ECHO
THROUGH GREEK THEATER
One Thousand Music Lovers Attend a
Sunday Afternoon Concert at
the University.
BERKELEY, May 8. â A thousand
people attended the concert given in
the Greek theater at the University of
California this afternoon for the bene
fit of . the students* clubhouse loan
fund. Last Sunday there were five
thousand people at the oratorio, but

sion. However, a thousand 25c pieces

Francisco directed the orchestra and
there were a number of well-known
soloists â Miss Caroline Halsted Lit
tle, soprano; Mrs. L. Snider-John
son, contralto; S. Homer Henley,

Secretary of War Probing
Jilted AVomaivs Accusa
tion Against the Colonel
Special Dispatch to The Call
CALL BUREAU, HOTEL BARTON,
WASHINGTON. May 8.â Uncle Sam
has never made a practice of mending
hearts broken by brass buttons, but
there have been enough aggravated
jiltings lately to cause Secretary Taft
to take up the subject. Judge Advo
cate General Davis Is now considering
the affair of the heart in which Lieu
tenant Colonel William F. Pitcher did
not lead to the altar Miss Caroline
Harold, . a clerk in the War Depart
ment."
On numerous previous occasions,
when irate fathers or brothers or
friends have come to the War Depart
ment with a tale about some young
woman being robbed of her hopes of a
military marriage, Secretary Taft and
his subordinates merely shrugged their
shoulders and said it would be impossi
ble to Interfere with the love affairs of
the officers. But Miss Harold has many
influential friends, who allege that she
had been badly treated. Among them
are Senator Simmons of North Caro
lina and Rear Admiral Colby M. Ches
ter. Colonel Pitcher is now with his
regiment, the Twenty-eighth Infantry,
at the Presidio of San Francisco.
Handsome, debonair and fond of,so
ciety, Colonel Pitcher is well known In
Washington and is said to be popular
In the army. He became engaged to
Miss Harold, say her friends, about six
months ago, and March 1 was set as
the date for the wedding. Rear Admi
ral Chester gave them a dinner, but on
February 29 Colonel Pitcher left Wash
ington with no excuse for his* depart
ure beyond a note that he had "been
called away."
Meanwhile Miss Harold had given up
her position in the War Department,
but when she was left at the matri
monial port she obtained reinstatement
and received much sympathy from
friends, including several offlcers In
the War Department, one of whom Is
sponsor for the charges which have
been Hied against Colonel Pitcher.
Senator Simmons called upon Secre
tary Taft before the latter went to St.
Louis ten days ago. The Secretary
suspended action until his return last
week. He was then informed that to
at least four or five other women Colo
nel Pitcher had proved himself a man
who "loved and rode away." " - *
"He seems to have the habit," said
Secretary Taft to Judge Advocate
General Davis, whom he asked to sup
ply him with advice on what grounds,
if any, the War Department. could In
terfere in the case.
All this action, it is said at the War
Department, was taken because of
Colonel Pitcher's unsatisfactory reply
to the War Department's notification
that charges were filed against him.
The burden of it is said to have been
that he had "changed his mind" about
marrying. '"r*<. ~'T-
Dr. Frederick L. Hosmer Announces
Resignation From the Firnt Uni
tarian Church of Berkeley.
BERKELEY, May- 8. â To the regret
of the entire congregation the Rev.
Frederick L. Hosmer has resigned the
pulpit of the First Unitarian Church,
from which he has preached for the
last four years. Dr. Hosmer himself
announced his resignation at the close
of his sermon at the church this
morning.
The notice of his contemplated
withdrawal was placed in the hands of
the trustees of the church more than
a month ago, but no public announce
ment was made at that time, as the
trustees hoped to prevail upon Dr.
Hosmer to remain. The pastor was
determined, however, and so at last
the trustees were obliged reluctantly
to accept his resignation.
Dr. Hosmer gives as his reason for
wishing to withdraw his need of a
rest.

Charged With Burglary.
William Uhl and James Wells were
arrested last night by Detectives
Regan -and Tracy, and booked at the
Southern station on charges of bur
glary. It is alleged that they, entered
the premises at 857 Howard street and
stole a box of valuable papers and old
coins from the room occupied by Peter
Dahl. When taken into custody the
box was found in their possession.
The resignation of John L. Howard
as a member of the City Council will bo
presented to that body to-morrow night
by Mayor OIney. Under the law the
resignation is self-operative, and with
out further action Mr. Howard will
cease to be a member of the municipal
legislature. George H. Collins, ship
ping and commission man of San Fran
cisco, will be named in hi3 place by
Mayor OIney.
It was originally intended by the
Mayor Xo hold the resignation of Mr.
Howard and not present it to the Coun
cil, so that upon the return of Mr.
Howard from Europe he could again
resume his work in the Council. This
would leave the Council with one mem
ber missing for about four months.
The Mayor was compelled to abandon
this plan because of pressure brought
to bear upon him by different members
of the Council, and he finally decided
to present Mr. Howard's resignation.
which has been in his possession for
several months, to the Council to-mor
row night.
Mr. Collins was suggested to the
Mayor by Mr. Howard as hJs successor
before his departure for Europe.

â¢ LIVERMORE, May 8.â The first sec
tion of the Phoenix Mine road up the
Arroyo Mociio has been completed ana
the Board of Supervisors has inspected
and accepted the work. The inspec
tion wai made on Thursday last with
John Beck, the contractor, County En
gineer Prather and Dave McDonald,
the road foreman for the district, and
thÂ» Supervisors pronounced the woik
a superior piece of construction.
This road has been the dream of the
residents of Livermore. It opens a
district heretofore isolated, for the road
up the Mocho has been so rough and
narrow a* to be impassable for heavy
teams. Back in the Livermore Moun
tains are many mines of quicksilver.
ms-snisite. chrome and other valuable
ores, but it has been impossible to de
velop these properties.
The late Alvinza Hayward Invested
heavily in quicksilver properties in the
lied Mountain district. Property val
ued at nearly a million dollars was pur
er.ased and a proposition was made to
the Aiameda County Board of Super
visors to build a road to Red Mountain
so the ore could be brought out by the
traction engines. It was taken up ay
A. L- H*r.ry. editor of the Livermore
Herald. M. G. Cailaghan. T. E. Knox,
f^straaster of Livermore, and many
other prominent citizens and business
men cf that section, and they interested
the Alameda County Board of Super
visors. These men appreciated the
value to Livermore of this road and
the f.ret contract was let some month.3
apo to John Beck. This first section
has now been comp'.eted. inspected,
found catisfactory and will be accep -
Â«â¢<! by the Supervisors to-morrow. The
work was done under the supervision
of County Engineer Prather and Road
Foreman David McDonald, and is one
cf the best pieces of mountain road iu
the State. At no j.olnt is it less than
sixteen feet wide and there is no place
where two heavily laden teams could
r.ot pass. â¢
The work upon the big quicksilver
mine ha* been slopped owing to the
death of Alvir.za Hayward. but withn
a few weeks it will be reopened undo*
the management of-William J. Dingee.
The plan includes the adoption of a.
traction engine system of communica
tion between the mines and Livermor*.
the traction trains to bring the ore into
LJvernr re and deposit it at the rail
road utiuion. The road has been built
to facilitate this plan and between the
mine and Livermore there is no grade
greater than 2 per cent. Returning,
the (Trade does* not exceed 6 per cent,
whioh the trains can easily surmount
when returning empty.
The contract for the second section
will b* let at the meeting of the Su
pervisors to-morrow and the road will
Lfe ready for use by the time the mine
is in operation. This road will open
anu aid in the development of a very
important portion cf Alameda County
that abounds in minerals of great
value, if proper communication with
that rtcUon can b<? established.
Both' T". G. Armstrong, the grand

eral description upon which to base
their belief that the girl they seek is
Identical with the one Policeman
Murphy remembers as having asked
him the way to Twenty-third avenue
on Wednesday, which was the day she
wa.s booked to arrive, according to
Armstrong's advices from his son and
her father, D. W. Armstrong of Wau
kesha, Wis.
The grandfather has no definite in
formation other than the letter his
son wrote him that Miss Armstrong
would arrive in Oakland Wednesday
on overland train No. 3. It was from
this very train that the young woman
alighted who is remembered by Po
liceman Murphy and by the carmen.
Armstrong has not given up hope that
his granddaughter might have stopped
off on her westward journey, as she
has relatives at Omaha; but the de
scription of the girl the police have
trailed and that of Miss Armstrong
tally fairly well.
Police inquiry has failed to uncover
a trace of missing Mabel Armstrong,
who is supposed to have disappeared
in Oakland after leaving an overland
train at Sixteenth-street station on the
way to her grandfather's home at
Leona Heights.
Detectives Shorey and Holland, who
have ' Undertaken to trace the girl,
have decided that a young woman who
generally answers Miss Armstrong's
description was seen to leave an Ala
meda electrie car at Twenty-third
avenue last "Wednesday afternoon, the
day of her arrival. According to car
men and policemen this same girl
boarded car 117 of the Sixteenth
street line at the depot and rode to
Thirteenth and Washington streets,
where she transferred to the east
bound Alameda car. She Impressed
the carmen as a stranger, for the girl
made Inquiry concerning Leona
Heights, and that Is her grandfather's
place of residence. But at Twenty
third avenue the trail is lost apparent
ly. .The detectives say they can find
nothing of the girl after she left the
car at that point. The girl was then

In a bit of drunken rage, Edward J.
Riley, a burly laborer employed at the
Eagle Box Factcrry, tried to burn his
wife to death this evening by saturat
ing her garments with coal oil and
touching a match to the inflammably
soaked clothing. The woman, a frail
creature, fought in desperation to save
herself and succeeded, but not until
after Riley had cut open her forehead
with a glass, ( and had buVned many
matches in his dastardly attack.
Riley's fiendish assault was made at
the Riley home in the rear of 1007 Sev
enth street, where the head of the
house arrived about 5:30 o'clock in an
ugly humor. Some words passed be
tween Mrs. Riley and her husband and
then the trouble began. As the woman,
told the story to the police, Riley grab
bed her in the presence- of their two
little children, threw her on a bed and
poured kerc-sene on her dress. Then
the whisky-crazed man lighted match
after match and tried to touch the
flame to the pil-soaked garments. Mrs.
Riley struggled and struggled with her
brawny husband, twisting and squirm
ing beyond reach of the burning sticks,
almost miraculously preventing her
husband from accomplishing his mur
derous purpose to incinerate her.
During the struggle Riley, his wife
said, struck her on the head with a
glass and then left the house. Mrs.
Riley called fcr assistance and Dr. W.
W. Kergan was summoned. He found
the woman's clothing drenched in coal
oil and blood from her wound. Follow
ing that the police were notified. Po
liceman Fahey found Riley at Seventh
and Market streets and had a battle
with the man, who gtrt away but was
arrested at Ninth and Market street.s
a few minutes afterward by Fahey and
Detective Shorey, who had been sent
from police headquarters and happened
along at an opportune moment.
"I know what I've done," declared
Riley on the way to the city prison.
"It's enough to warrant you In tarring
and feathering me."
Riley, will be held at the city prison
until Mrs. Riley makes up her mind
what she desires to do with her hus
band. Riley is 27 years old and was
formerly a member of -the San Fran
cisco Pcriice Department. He tips the
scales at 19" pounds.

At a signal from one of the onlookers
ElHs- and Richard opened the battle,
and a battle that would have sent the
blood surging through the most impas

the awakened ones took in the situa

telephoned to police headquarters.
Captain of Police Petersen sent a
posse composed of Detective Kyte and
Patrolmen Andrews. Cockerton and
Schumar. who oiiickly Interrupted the
fistic duel and sent the duelists to the
City Prison.
Under the light it was a question
whether Kills or Richard â¢ was the
worse for the encounter. Ellis* Jaw
was hammered out of joint; his face
was a mass of contusions; his chin was
ripped open and he generally appeared
as if a busy handsaw had engaged him.
Unde'r'the branching limbs of big
Ehade trees in aristocratic Harrison

The Livermore Herald, which is the
only Democratic paper in Alameda
County, has this to say regarding the
political situation In this county:
William R. Hearst is not going to
have the solid delegation from Alameda
County that has been claimed for him.
It Is true that he will have the major
ity of the delegation, but the rural sec
tion has gone against him and will vote
against him in the Santa Cruz conven
tion.

We have made a large number of sales dur
ing the past week and mc*t of these sales have
been made to outside people, which shows that
strangers are beginning to realize that Oak
land property Is a good Investment and one
that will pay a good Interest on the capital
Invested. The fact that this city will soon be
the western terminus of the Santa Fe Railroad
has stimulated the market M some extent, and
there is a marked demand for property In the
vicinity of the Santa Fe's new depot.
Workmen will commence this week to re
move the old buildings at the northwest corner
of Twelfth and Harrison streets, adjoining thÂ«
Dewey Theater, to make way for a new four
story pre*fÂ»ed. brick front building 100x100 In
Â«tse, which we have Just consummated a lease
for C. H. King, the owner, to the Business
College for the three upper floors for a tÂ»rm of
ten years at an aggregate rental of $33,000.
The entire investment will approximate upward
of $100, COO and will accommodate over 10w>
students. Negotiations are now tn progres*
for the lease, of the entire lower portion for
business i>urpc*e*. It is the Intention to push
the building forward with all possible rapidity.
Three floors of the new Majestic Apartmwit-
Houm at Fifteenth and Franklin streets, re
cently completed by a client of ours, have Just
been leased for five years by Pan Francisco
parties at an average rental cf $3 a room.
Prospective purchasers of Oakland property
are numerous, and the only difficulty la to find
Katlsraetory prooerty. TlÂ»# demand for prop
erty on Telepraph avenue Is Increasing, ana
durlnjr the last week we have sold three lots
fronting on that thoroughfare. Since the work
of repairing the avenue has b*en commenced
people are waklnsr up to the fact that prop
erty fronting on that street Is desirable, both
for business and reMdene*. AÂ« the sunim-r
advances the demand for homes on this slJe
of the bay in steadily Increasing.
W. J. Laymance of the Laymance
Real Estate Company said:
Local real estate dealers report little
change in the condition of the Alameda
County market, which during the last
four months has shown a steady,
healthy activity, which Indicates that
the sale* during the summer will be
unusually large. The principal business
done during the spring months has
been in residence property, and it Is
probable that more homes will be erect
ed during the present year than ever
before in the same length of time. All
parts of Oakland, Alameda and Berke
ley have been favored by purchasers of
home sites, and where a year ago there
were long stretches of vacant property,
there are now hundreds of handsome
residences, built by people that intend
to make their homes on this side of the
bay.
Frank J. Woodward of the Realty,
Bond and Finance Company in review
ing the. condition of the market said:
The sprint- market haa been good notwith
standing the fact that bad weather Interfered
to some extent with the opcnln*. We have
had many Inoulrles for all kind* of property
during the last week and present Indication*
point to a fir*t-cla*s summer market. Several
good *alea wore made throug-h our office lsurt
week, the most Important of which was tn<s
cale of ten flats on the corner of Eleventh an<i
Oak .trtets for F. T. McHenry to CHarlea M
McGregor. The flats brtn* a monthly rental
of $270 and the purchase price was $26,000.

CM. Wooster Co. report the sale
of lots at auction, Saturday, May 7, at
Palo Alto, highly successful and satis
factory in every sense. The sale was
well attended, requiring a special
train of eleven Pullman coaches to
carry the 700 purchasers to the prop
erty from San Francisco. Many peo
ple came from San Jose. The bidding
was quite spirited, as was anticipated,
as this property is of the most desir
able class. There were over 100 lots
sold, averaging $400 a lot. On account
of the limited time in which they had
to sell they could not finish their cata
logue, and the unsold . lots, all of
which are equally as desirable as the
ones sold, will .be offered at private
sale on the same terms.

liam Kirk Guthrie, pastor of the First
Presbyterian Church, last night. But
one part of the subject was discussed
and next Sunday night the second part
will be given.
The early career and boyhood days
of the eminent divine were treated,
which gave the reverend gentleman
the opportunity to extol those mothers
whose teachings and lives have been
the power and influence on so many
great and renowned men of the world,
among them Dr. Rainsford.
The Rev. Mr. Guthrie holds that a
mother can do more than any other
In civilizing the world and. he strongly
urged that every mother should teach
her sons the grandeur and the beau
ties of the world, thereby helping
them to appreciate the wonders of na
ture which must have its effect in
later life.

evening at the same place Dr. Frank
M. Bristol, pastor of Metropolitan
Church, Washington, D. C, preached

DELEGATES AT SERVICE.
At the . First Methodist Episcopal

beautiful churches in Southern Califor
nia, Dr. J. R. Leonard spoke at the

meetings, the first at the South Pasa
dena Church in the morning, and in
the evening at Blanchard's Hall in this
city. A great crowd assembled to hear
brief talks . by half a dozen of the
prominent visiting ministers, including
Bishops Foss and Waldron. The meet
ing was much in the form of a revival
service.
One of the sensations of the confer
ence, which, however, did not reach the
public until to-day, has been the circu
lation of copies of a pamphlet issued
by Evangelist Manhall of the Bible
League, which is construed to mean
the opening of the contest against the
higher criticism. The pamphlet con
tains strong references to Dr. James
M. Buckley, editor of the New York
Advocate, who acted as counsel for.
Professor Bowne in the recent church
trial. It was intimated to-day that the
circulating of this pamphlet upon the
floor of the conference is likely to be
a subject , of criticism in open confer
ence to-morrow and may result in a
rule prohibiting the circulation of un
authorized documents on the floor of
the conference in the future.
Many of th^ most important ques
tions to be decided by this conference
will come up for consideration and ac
tion during the present week. It is be
lieved that the- question of consolidat
ing the various book concerns into one
central publishing house will be re
ported by the book concern during the
present week. The episcopacy commit
tee, which is the; only committee that
meets in executive session, will proba
bly come to a decision in the matter
of retiring and increasing the number
of Bishops.

CHICAGO, May 8.â "The worst symp
tom in the present life of the churchy is
not a falling off in attendance or con

degeneration of the men and women
who attend and contribute and who be
lieve they are saved." So writes Pro
fessor G. E. Daw'son,' Ph. D., of the
Hartford School of Religious Pedagogy.
Hartford, Conn., in the current number
of the Biblical World, issued from the
University of Chicago press. Professor
Da wson "asserts in his article that lack
of modern - science '- in the ' church has
made a "type of salvation that encour
ages neglect of body, undermines the
physical- basis of life and inevitably
leads to organic disease or insanity,
or both." Continuing Professor Daw
son writes: . , . ' '
A belief .in .the. type of salvation that re
sults in the arrest of development of intellect
entails upon its votaries progressive mentai

eide t - led by Mrs. J. W. Orr, one of the
ablest and most, tactful women in the
:J cfyb, proved good losers. The next \
' bes.t thing on earth to success is to be
a cheerful loser. â¢"" Â¦
â¢When the result of the election was
6f3c:ally announced to the hundred and
mere women who remained to see the
â¢ 'tiling through. Mrs. Orr was the first '
â¢ -to .tender felicitations to Mrs. Colton. |
i hÂ£r successful opponent, and to offer
' -lrer support for the coming year. This
.-frraceful act was considered a prece
dent- by Mrs. Orr's followers, and a Â¦
."â¢promise of loyalty to the club and its
-new personnel of officers followed.
"The year upon which the club Is en
"-tcrir.g: will be one of vital Importance
; to the future of the club, as the $30,000
oi'ubhouse is under way. and the ex
â¢ pÂ«~nses of construction will have to be
met.. However, much of the responsi
bility will rest with the board of direc
tcir?,. which is conceded to be a strong
Selection. Mrs. Arthur Cornwall, who
*fcas won the reputation of being the
_I{JisscJl Sage of the club, having en
"pi?:eered financial feats for the organ- \
izatiori at various times, and filled the
i etfffera in clever fashion, was elected
by* appreciative vote. Mrs. Hovey
Foiled, the largest vote of the directors,
beir.p the unconscious choice of both
tkkets, which, on discovery, was dis
tinctly funny. When it is stated that
. but five tickets out of 283 were voted
"stfarght the earnestness of the contest
ta^i be understood.
â¢ As a demonstration of the beneficent
effect of clubs upon women, the imme
diate conduct of the election was well
rbred and dignified for the most part, al
though feeling in some instances ran

eif diplomacy. It may not be honest and
â¢ f i-ink and open, but it is a great lubri

I where more than in the club and in the
â¢ fcothc It is in the discipline of women's
; -minds and in the learning of -word
values that the greatest gain comes to
XK/?m from club life. Men have always
tad a better understanding of the ex
*act_ mear.ingrs and values of words than
â¢ women, and they acquired the knowl
edge- as lads through the solar plexus
But girls and women, as a
â¢ rule. -don't use fists in discussions â nor
â¢can fists be used upon them; thus their
/tomewhat indiscriminate use of un-
I.pleasant words can be corrected only
by mental discipline. Who can say but
this cultivation of diplomacy in women
â ;vhich is a synonym for tact â may be
â¢ the .means of overcoming the divorce
"Â¦Â£vil? Seriously, it must have a psycho

/ Thus the dove of peace hovers hap

desire for the club's prosperity.

On Wednesday afternoon the mem
bers of the Forum Club were uniquely
entertained by Miss Mabel Ayer, State
president of the Sunshine Society, who
presented to her audience a group â or
troupeâ of trained butterflies. Now the
ladies had all heard of trained canaries
and canines and even of trained tab
by cats, but butterflies were new. The
things they did in response to the sug
gestion â at the point of a pin â of Miss
Ayer \yÂ£re intensely interesting. One
of the' remarkable facts about them
was their resolute refusal to remain in
the hand or on the gown of a nervous
or restless woman. Many of us sympa
thize with the butterflies.
May 3, 1904, the Country Club met at
the home of Mrs. Walmsley, in Irving
ton. The subject for the day was par
liamentary law and Scottish literature,
and the papers read on James Thomp
son, Robert Burns and Sir Walter Scott
were listened to with interest. The sub
ject of parliamentary law was touched
upon briefly, after which the members
were entertained with musical selec
tions. The club adjourned to meet the
first Tuesday in June at the home of
Miss Bertha Whipple, in Centervllle.
The Corona Club election of officers
for the ensuing year has taken place,
with the following result: President,
Mrs. Robert Wallace; first vice presi
dent, Mrs. Charles Ham; second vice

and Mrs. E. D. Treadwell. The club's
annual breakfast will take place on
May 12, when a feast of wit and good
fellowship will launch the new' officers
on their official careers.
Th>j Irving Club led the club functions
of the week when on Thursday it ten
dered a reception at Elks' Hall to thÂ»
senior class of Irving Institute. It was
distinctly a smart affair, the fair maids
of the graduating class wearing pretty
white frocks. Dr. Stewart" delivered a
lecture on "Modern Music," which was
charmingly illustrated by Miss Leila C.
Stone, Miss Florence Darby, Mrs. Ben
jamin Apple, Miss Viola H. Samter and
Miss Camille Frank.

Hall on Friday. Pleasant weather and
the announcement that- the meeting
would be one of special interest
brought out the ladies in full force.
Five new members were added to the
list of membership. The association
was addressed by Mrs. Frederick Col
burn, who told what San Francisco is
doing at the St. Louis exposition and
incidentally suggested that & donation
of bear flags would be acceptable to
the committee on display. Mrs. Bald
win of the California Club sought the
co-operation of the Pioneer Women in
behalf of the outdoor flower market.
The Association of Pioneer Women of
California held its monthly business
meeting at its quarters in Golden Gate
The Mills Alumnae Association held
it* annual meeting in the afternoon, at
which $5000 was raised as a contribu
tion toward the endowment fund. Like
wise was $500 subscribed toward a
scholarship to be known as the Mary
Upton scholarship.
These tributes of love to their alma
mater were, in truth, a pleasant tribute
to Mrs. Mills, the vigilant head of the
college.
The pledges of eternal friendship ex
changed during the last lingering hours
of college life were full of the hopeful
ness of youth.
On Wednesday the Mills Club, Mrs.
James McGauley president, attended
the founders' day exercises at Mills
College en masse, where the members
were entertained by Mrs. Mills at
luncheon.
As a cultural and social club the
Laurel Hall presents many interesting
programmes. Its section work Is par
ticularly high class. With Mrs. Ella
Sexton in the chair much is. expected
from the club during the year.
The officers of Laurel Hall Club for
the ensuing year are as follows: Presi
dent. Mrs. Ella M. Sexton; first vice
president, Mrs. Benjamin Peart; second
vice-president. Mrs. W. H. Barrows;
recording secretary, Mrs. Malcolm
Johnson; corresponding secretary, Mrs.
John S. Gray; treasurer, Mrs. H.'J.

The clever "Cap and Bells," Mrs. S.
P. Buckingham president, will hold its
monthly meeting on Thursday at tha
new home of Mrs. Squire Varich Moon
ey, 2010 Broadway.
In this baby member of clubdom is
a vast amount of talentâ musical, the
atrical, literaryâ and some clever re
conteurs. Some good "Cap and Bells"
stories have wandered beyond the con
fines of the club, by the way, but "of
course men can't keep anything, you
know," say the women who related the
stories to their husbands. But fortun
ately they're repeatable stories. Here
with is the programme to be rendered,
which is under the direction of Mrs.
S. P. Blumenberg, chairman pro
gramme committee:
"Wit and Humor," members; piano solo â
a "Xachstuck" No. 4, b "AufschwunR" â
(Schumann). Miss Ena Lantrworthy; "La Belle
Parlslenne" (eong, with dance, from "The
Belle of New York"). Mrs. V. C. Drlffleld;
psychic talk. Dr. Tryphinnle B. Janes; con
tralto solo. Â»IiFÂ« Helena Roeckel. Mrs. S. P.
Blumcnbers. accompanist â a. "The Temple
Bells." b "Less Than the Dust, c "Kashmiri"
song, d "I ShaTl Awake" â (Amy Woodforde
Flnden): Uance^ â a "California Coquette," b
"Minuctte de la Coeur"â Mrs. M. TYilkins.
The speaker, being essentially a
military man, assumed the position of
all militants, that war does not bru
talize a people, nor individuals, but es
tablishes a discipline over each that be
comes a factor for good government.
Of course, many of the ladies didn't
share the general's views, but their
enjoyment of the talk was thorough.
Mrs. J. Â£1. Birmingham sang one of
Massenet's pretty lyrics in her usual
splendid style.
The Sorosis Club has established the
commendable custom of evening enter
tainments, where the men-folk axe bid
den to enter the precincts of tea and
talk. Last week the club was ad
dressed by General C. A. Woodruff on
"The Probabilities of Future War."
If the general is as good a warrior as
he Is a reconteur he would be a regi
ment all by himself.

brothers on other continents do not fear

. The distributive trade is reported better, however,
owing lo the improvement in the weather, which has
stimulated the jobbing and retail demand in many sec
tions, though it has produced very little effect on the
wholesale and foreign trade. If there was any feature
of prominence last week it was the more unfavorable
r.ews regarding the wheat crop, which shows a decided
deterioration from the April condition. The severe tem
peratures of the past winter, when the crop was unpro
tected by snow, followed by a cold, wet spring, which re
tarded the growth of the plant, produced their effect,
which is now becoming manifest. There will be no
serious shortage in the crop, but earlier estimates are
being cut down, especially in the winter wheat belt.oi
the Middle West. In the spring belt seeding is practi
cally .finished, except in the Red River. Valley, and the
outlook there is fair. It was expected that tlve disclo
sures relative to the impairment of the crop would send
wheat up somewhat and Wall street railroad stocks cor
respondingly down, but they did neither to any extent.
Trade is in that languid condition when conditions must
be radical and violent to affect values.
Statistics continue to run against any good showing.
The bank clearings still show a moderate falling off
every week from the corresponding period Ia3t year, and
while the shrinkage is 'never large, it is continuous. That
last week was 11.4 per cent, with two-thirds of the im
portant cities "ranged on the losing side. The aggregate
clearings, however, again exceeded the two billion dol
lar point, probably owing to the improvement in the
distributive trade mentioned above. The failures were
206, against 176 last year, but none of them were serious
enough to attract attention. Railway earnings in April
were 5.8 per cent less than in April, 1903, and commodity
price?, according to Dun's index number, declined
s-lightly during the month.
Affairs in Wall street are in a very tame condition at
present. The public are still out of the market, and
from present indications intend to remain out^ of it in
definitely. The great financial interests continue to ten
der them the be?t of speculative bait, but they are not
touching it. These financial interests, as already men
tioned, are calling attention to the fact that money is a
glut at from 1 to 3 per cent, while the railroads and in
dustrial concerns are paying 4 and 5 per cent dividends
right along. "Why not borrow money on time loans at
3 and 3% per cent and buy standard stocks which pay
5 per cent?' 1 ask the great financial interests, with their
blandest smiles. But their blandishments fall upon deaf
ears. The public will not buy. Perhaps they suspect that
these 4 and 5 per cent dividends are being paid out of
the recent enormous borrowings from the banks, men
tioned several times of late, and which aggregate, ac
cording to generally accepted estimates, to upward of
$300,000,000, and indeed actual talk to that effect has
been heard in speculative circles. Whether the suspicion
has any foundation in fact remains to be seen.
Another deterrent is the fear that a year from now
these great railroads and industrials may be paying 2%
per cent instead of 5 per cent, and some may be paying
nothing at all. There has also been some talk to this
effect. Of course all these conjectures and speculations
tend to keep unprofessional speculators out of the
market.
There is still another deterrent factor in this propo
sition of dividends. It is the statement that the divi
'dend disbursements in May will be the smallest May
record for years. The total, based on dividends already
declared, is only $14,991,357. against $21,025,697 in May,
1903, and $18,793,981 in May, 1902. Last year the United
States Steel Corporation paid a quarterly dividend of
$8,930,496, but this year the disbursement will be re
duced to $6,054,919 in consequence of the conversion ot
preferred stock into boijds. Other companies will pay
dividends' on a reduced percentage, and several which
paid last year will be missing from the list.
There is nothing especially new in the leading staples.
The number of idle factories has increased, especially in
textiles and footwear, and the depression in the silk
industry mentioned last week continues. Structural
work is increasing with better weather, but dealers had
accumulated large stocks of building material, and
prices are consequently rather weak than otherwise. All
descriptions of clothing are reported quieter. Iron and
steel are still quiet and no longer attract attention. Pro
visions are in large supply and dragging at the leading
Western packing points. -Hides and wool exhibit no fea
tures worthy of comment. Groceries show the usual
fluctuations, up and down.
Our local conditions remain unchanged. We are
largely dependent upon -our. cereal and fruit crops on
this coast, and both are looking well, considering the
situation as a whole. The same authority that is cutting
down the estimates of the wheat crop in the winter belt
gives brilliant reports from the three coast States, the
condition of California wheat being given at 90, Oregon
at 99 and Washington at 100. The Weather Bureau
reports the fruit crop looking well almost everywhere,
and the handlers of canned and dried fruit report both
markets generally cleaned up, with the exception of rai
sins and prunes, both of which will probably have some
carry-over at the end of the season. The hay crop, ac
cording to local handlers, will be one of the heaviest
ever known.
General business is good all over the coast. Money is
abundant, collections are normal and theMomestic and
export trade are both excellent. " Some quieting down in
sympathy with the East, by which we are largely gov
erned in many lines, is. noted, but as a rule the movement
of produce and merchandise is excellent and profit mar
gins are very satisfactory.
BUSINESS continues monotonous and feature
less all over the country. Whether we regard the
money market, the merchandise market, foreign
and domestic commerce in general or the industries, we
find the same apathy in all directions. Conditions now
are about as they are in midsummer, when business
shrinks to a low level and the whole field of trade is as
([uict as a millnond.
Dear Mr. Skilton: Those who in the
past have devoted themselves to the
diffusion of ideas have usually had
much to suffer and have met with lit
tle appreciation; they died before it
came. Remembering the fates of such,
I may regard myself as extremely for
tunate. Though during the first half of
my literary career, the losses were
great and the encouragements small,
yet the last half^has made amends;
and I may be more than satisfied alike
with the material, results and the ef
fects produced, as well as with the
marks of approval which have been'
coming to me more and more fre
quently.
Among these last the resolution
passed-by the Brooklyn Ethical Asso
ciation, which I received yesterday, is
one of the most gratifying and calls
for special thanks. â From The Inde

Tou think that I have got some mes
sage and that utterance of it might
stave off impending evils. I have but
one message â be honest; regard the
equitable claims of others while main
taining your own. The disregard, of
nil save personal Interests is the under
lying cause of your present state and
of Impending disasters. As I said
years ago, apropos of American af
fairs, a fatal trait in your society is
the admiration for smart men, and I
believe I said or implied that a people
among whom there is an admiration
for smart men will come to grief. If
you think that a healthier ideal can be
established in American society by
teaching, I entirely disagree with you.
Under your present condition men
could not be got to listen. Even if
they listened they would not be con
rinced. Arid even if they were con
vinced their conduct would not' be ap
preciably affected. When men are un
der the influence of pronounced feel
ings no amount of reason changes their
behavior. Â¦
A true theory of social progress is
rot a cause of movement, but is simply
cil to the movementâ serves simply to
remove friction. The force producing
the movement is the aggregate' of
men's instincts and sentiments, and
these are not to be changed by a the
ory.
When I was leaving America in W82
I was unawares interviewed on board
the vessel Just before we started. The
interviewer asked me what I thought
of the triumph over the "bosses" which
had Ju.Â«t been achieved. I expressed
my belief that it was only a flash in
the pan and that the old state of things
would after a time return. It has, as
you know, returned. The recent dis
closures have shown that the condition
of things in New York had again be
come as bad as it was.
Dear Mr. Skilton: In one respect you
have misread my books, or misunder
stood an essential thing contained in
them. Tou believe that the course of
things in society is to be changed by
teaching. I do not believe any such
thing. Everywhere I have contended,
and I contend still, that Jfelings. not
ideas, determine social resultsâ that
everything depends, not upon intellect,
but upon character; and character is
not to be changed in a day or in a
generation.

QUIET COMMERCIAL DAYS.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, MAY 9, 1904.
Society in the national .-capital was roundly denounced
by a nationally respected clergyman recently, for the false
ideals and palpable immoralities which: distinguish
fashionable life in Washington. The pursuit of studied
and elegant leisure seems to be the only profession in
which men and women make an emphatic' failure. " *
, Among the myriad reports from the Oriental war is
one that is of exceptional interest. It asserts upon
reasonable authority that 10 per cent of the Japanese
army are women of the coolie class, who are fighting
with "desperate patriotism in the; field. The fact that the
story' is probably untrue gives it greater importance,
for it shows that the Japanese. are placing deep reliance
upon that most potent of weapons in any cause â senti
ment.
It. is to be regretted that the association of old firemen,
the volunteers who fought the city's fires without pay
and without reward other than the consciousness of
work well done, is being neglected and forgotten in its
old age. The old men are going to their long sleep very
rapidly and they should not be permitted to go without
the knowledge that to the end they lived in the best
opinion of San Francisco. and her new generation of men.
Age has its common marks every
where. An old man stoops, shrinks in
stature and becomes round-shouldered;
an aged tree sheds its branches, breaks
off at the top and finally tumbles into
ruin; a time-worn mountain loses Its
aspiring peaks, smooths down Its
jagged outlines, rounds off its steep
slopes, sinking lower and lower under
the constant wear of the elements, un
til only a line of green-carpeted hills
remains to mark the place where tre
mendous summits rose Into the region
of perpetual snow and flashed back the
sunshine from a crown of glaciers.
It is relatively an easy task to cal

There is something almost lifelike in

attain their maximum stature all at a
leap. The first great uplift of the Sier

the range about 2500 feet. Even that
was not done at a bound. It took time
while the gigantic pressures were at
work. Vast periods also elapsed while
the growing mountains swelled upward
to their culmination of 14,000 or 15.000
feet. Perhaps they are still growing.

It must be a matter of the deepest regret to every
friend of the University of California that the authori

upon the honesty of "any part of the student body as to
accuse undergraduates of "cribbing" in the examinations.
It should be the duty of the various classes to institute
a most rigid inquiry, hunt out the offenders and insure
their expulsion., The initiative by the students would
have an . immediate effect in a salutory lesson.

Hmv Torpedoes Are Made.
The Whitehead torpedo, built for the
United States Government, is made
chiefly of steel, and nearly In the
shape of a porpoise. Its greater diam
eter is nearly eighteen inches. It Is
made in two sizes or lengths of about
twelve feet and seventeen feet, respec
tively. The weight of the shorter one,
ready for discharge, is nearly half a
ton. As constructed by the E. w.
Bliss Company of Brooklyn, these tor
pedoes are made In five sections, con
taining in all nearly 2000 separate
pieces. Beginning at the head of the
machine, which is sometimes called
the business end. we find 110 pounds of
wet gun cotton packed above a bronze
partition. This cotton is inserted in
the form of disks, which are pierced
through their centers to make room for
a little brass case of dry gun cotton
priming. The front end of the dry gun
cotton Is pierced to receive the deton
ating primer, containing fulminate of
mercury, and capped with a percussion
cap. In front of the primer case is
screwed a war nose, which operates
automatically when 'the torpedo strike*
the target by driving the firing pin
against the cap and so effecting a se
ries of explosions ending with the wet
gun cotton.
Back of the head Is the flask, which
occupies more than half the length of
the machine. It is filled with air com
pressed to a pressure of 1230 pounds to
the square inch, or to one-ninetieth of
its ordinary volume. The escape of
this air through a small valve leading
to the engines and motors, placed in a
compartment back of the flask, fur
nishes all the power for the locomotion
of the machine.
Between the flask and the engine
there is a very important compartment
containing the mechanism for auto
matically regulating the depth of im
mersionâkeeping it constant accord
ing to a setting of the machine. Thi3
device was never patented, but was
kept a secret, the details of it being
sold to the various maritime nations.
The principle of it Is this: There are
several apertures through the walls of
the machine which are covered by dia
phragms on thin rubber. The pressure
of the water outside, which increase:)
with the depth, pushes these in
ward accordingly, and at the same
time pushes pistons that rest
behind the rubber diaphragms.
The motion of the pistons is communi
cated to horizontal rudders, co that a
slight deviation from the assigned
depth will immediately incline them;
and thus the machine is raised or de
pressed as required. A pendulum sus
pended in the same compartment op
erates similarly to keep the machine
In a horizontal position.â From "Tor

This little comedy in the Democratic players' camp is
amusing enough to the spectators, but it has its uncom
fortable element for the actors. It is said that the tru
est actor is one who can so far forget himself in the de
lineation of the character he represents that he becomes
oblivious to everything save that which appertains to
his mimic art. Mr. Bryan is such a one.. In playing the
part -of. the. Presidential aspirant, and later the enforced
role of the "once was" who would be it once again, the
gentleman from the Platte has shown a soulfulness of
dramatic expression and a thoroughness in every detail
of the mummer's trade that rivals comparison with any
thing the Democratic stage has seen. But, as suggested
before, this wonderful concentration upon character de
lineation reacts upon the rest of the players with no
inconsiderable discomfort.
If the Democracy of Nebraska in particular, and the
Democratic convention in general, would enjoy immu
nity from* embarrassment and even a small degree of
tranquillity, they should delegate somebody to wake Mr.
Bryan and bring him back to things mundane. When
Democracy" is united in the belief that the late Presiden
tial aspirant is no longer a power to move the world it
may even succeed in making the light break in on the
Bryan conscience. Until that auspicious time Democ
racy, and especially the perturbed Nebraska Democracy,
has the undivided sympathies of a charitable world.

Mine ear is much enamour'd of thy note;
So is mine eye enthralled to thy shape.
IT seems that Bryan, the irrepressible, is causing the
Democratic leaders of Nebraska to sit up nights in
anxious speculation over the probable" antics in which
the silver-tongued orator of the Platte will indulge him
self at the St. Louis convention. From Omaha comes
the word that William Jennings Bryan is planning a
bolt for the whole Nebraska delegation if things do not
go as he wishes in the Democratic wigwam, and dis
traught party whips declare that such an action will bean
indelible blot on the fair name of Democracy as she
grows in Nebraska.

proud distinction of becoming a happy,
though savage, mother. When the well
wishers had arrived at the spot and
craned over the fence they saw the
two tortoises (females) basking in som
nalent ease with no maternal carea
seeming to depress them, and on the
dome like back of, each was painted in
glaring white one impudent word:
"Rubber."
Several years ago the university was
the proud possessor of two female land
tortoises from the Galapagos Islands,
each weighing nigh onto a thousand
pounds and reputed to be old as Me
thuseleh. They were kept in a pen
behind the agricultural building ana
after the first wave of curiosity had
swept over the studejits the ancient
reptiles were left to their own devices.
* One dark and starry night two stu
dents, armed with a bicycle lantern and
a can of white paint, climbed into the
turtles' Inclosure and busied themselves
for several minutes in a mysterious
manner. . Shortly ' afterward the office
of the student dally newspaper wa3
rung up on the phone and a voice, pur
porting to be that of a respected pro
fessor in the "cow college," notified the
enterprising young night editor that
the two turtles behind the agricultural
building had reproduced themselves
and had consequently born the flr3t
young of their kind in captivity. Cer
tainly, in the professor's mind, it was
a noteworthy occasion.
The next morning the student paper
appeared with a long story about the
baby turtles on its front page with a
good, thick, black head and a lengthy
introduction. In view of the fact that
the mother turtle was particularly sav
age on account of the presence of her
babies the students were gravely warn
ed by the college organ not to venture
too near the inclosure, but to stand
on the wood pile at a safe distance
away.

is to. be put with a like amount of public "money, already
set aside by the board to complete the amount of esti
mated cost of : $50,000 for the new feature.
The board very properly signified its unwillingness to
begin the \vork until the whole amount |of money is
placed in its hands/when it is promised to push the work
to a speedy, conclusion. . It is fully realized that to
raise such a sum is difficult, notwithstanding that the
gentlemen who represented the organizations were act
ing in perfect good faith. It is a transaction in which
a very considerable amount of money is involved, and the
Commissioners would subject themselves to severe criti
cism if the work were half completed and then aban
doned to be left as an eyesore for lack of fun,ds. >
While it is true that the athletic grounds will be a
splendid addition to the park and will be enjoyed by the
general public in a large measure, at the^ same time the
feature will be more particularly beneficial to the driv
ing clubs and athletic organizations using.it, and there
fore it is but fair that they should take an active inter
est in its realization. That there is need for more exten
sive'room and apparatus for the different kinds of sports
in the park the usual crowded condition of the tennis
court, for instance, is an example, and it is much to be
hoped .that the matter will not be permitted to drag for
lack of enthusiasm in obtaining the necessary "money.
Organized effort by the various bodies particularly
interested should be made immediately, j The devotees of
baseball, tennis, golf, cricket, racing, football, bicycling
and in fact all those who are fond of physical exercise,
should 'combine for their common interest and make a
sport of the work of obtaining the money needed, so
that .the contemplated park athletic grounds may soon
become a reality. ' â¢ \

TIMES
6There are more than 17,000 machine
tending operatives in Lowell, Mass.,
caring for 83S.O00 spindlet, and earning
over $500,000 a month in wages.
L. V. Hendricks, secretary of the Oro
ville Chamber of Commerce, has pre
pared a statement in which certain
damaging stories are refuted. This is In
part as follows:
The dredging proposition in simply this: By
those who have no knowledge of dredging, it
was thought possible that Oroville would be
dredged. In an effort to extend Pomona ave
nue, -which is the lost street in the Smith &
Tucker Addition, through the De Lancle Tract,
this proposition has been made use of by those
favoring the extension to I incite co-operation.
The De â¢ Lancle Tract is under lease â to be
dredged and the effort to open Pomona avenue
Is of course being: resisted by the dredg;lns
people. Should the street not be opened, about
two acre* north. of the line of Pomona avenuÂ«
will be dredged, but here the dredging of Oro
ville will cease, excent that several lots In
the Veach Tract, which adjoins the De Lancie
Tract, which were . Inundated several times
during last winter, and which have Inexpensive
cottages on them, will be mined.
The reason " that dredging will stop here is
simply that they cannof pay the prices which
would be asked for the homes that would be
for sale. Some of them could not be, bought
at any price and the throwing up of tailing
piles near by would occasion damage suits.
The moat that has been offered for dredging
land is $3000 per acre, and many dredging
men think that those who have paid this will
be sick of their bargain. At this rate. If there
were no buildings on the townslte, many of
the residence lots, presuming, them to be. of
their present Intrinsic value and all for sale,
might be bought, but their having . buildings
upon- them' removes all question of the ground
being dredged, and we are- not taking into
consideration the difficulty ! which would be
experienced in a dredger getting over a street.
â¢ To dredglnar " men the Idea of mining Oro
ville is amuainff. - It Is silly to those who un
derstand the : conditions. ' W. Â¦ P. Hammond,
who understands dredging i better than ' any
other man, probably, in the world. Is now lay-'
ing off an addition on tailings to the extreme
west of Oroville. He would not . be dolnjr
thin work If he feared the town * would be
dredc^l. Â¦ "' ...
The number of acres of cultivated land
which have been or are to be dredgod' amounts
to nothing compared with the land! worthless
for. agricultural purposes in the dredging dis
trict. The big boats have been a big boon to
Oroville and for. forty years to come will be a
big i source - of income to the town. Wo don't
hate the dredger here. * - : :
Secretary Hcmlrlcks of Oroville Re
futes Damaging Stories.
NO: FEAR OF DREDGERS.
The committee had an itinerary that
took in the following places, In the or
der named: Sacramento, Newcastle,
Auburn, Reno, Sacramento; on the re
turn: Woodland, Oroville, Marysville,
Chico, Red Bluff, Redding, Sacramento,
Merced, Modesto for the irrigation ju
bilee season, Visalia, Hanford, Bakers
field, Tulare, Fresno and Oakland.
From Oakland the committee went
back to Santa Cruz.
To thousands of dwellers in the inte
rior the Santa Cruz Promotion Com
mittee presented the charms of cool
sea breezes and other attractions to be
found in Santa Cruz County. The ster
eopticon views that .were nightly ex
hibited illustrated the Santa Cruz
beach, the cliff drive, the Santa Cruz
Courthouse, trie Santa Cruz High
School, river scenery, the encampment
ground, residences on the bluff at San
ta Cruz, the Big Basin and the meeting
therein of Governor Pardee and Gov
ernor Wells of Utah, the mammoth
rose bush on the library lot in Santa
Cruz, surf bathing, and there were al
together 100 scenes that were placed
nightly on a screen.
The people of Santa Cruz believe that
benefits cannot fail to follow the
unique tour of the Santa Cruz Promo
tion Committee. This would seem to
be an entirely reasonable opinion. The
Income in summer time of Santa Cruz
is largely derived from Its visitors. The
committee brought home to the people
who live where the air is warm in sum
mer al! the facts thev could to show
what theie is attractive by the shore
in the summer.
The formal concerts were, given Un
the afternoon in some central public
place; the exhibitions of stereopticon
views were in the evening, as a matter
of course. The march back to the
train after a visit was as formal as the
entry into the place from the train.
, VISIT MANY PLACES.
town that were off the line of march.
Nothing seemingly had been left to
chance. It was arranged so that,
hours before the daily concerts by the
band, concert programmes, which were
carefully followed, were . distributed
broadcast among . the public. Some
time before the train was to reach any
place : where a stop had been sched
uled, dispatches were sent forward to
the newspapers of the town or city
and alao to the Mayor, Board of. Trade,
Chamber of Commerce or other repre
sentative body of the approach of the
Promotion Committee of Santa Cruz.
Delegations from Boards of Trade and
Mayors therefore met the committee
and its band at the railway stations.
Santa Cruz was reported to be all
right/and the committee "made good"
on this statement as soon as possible.
The Interior newspapers gave space to
the Santa Cruz committee. In return
the' newspaper offices were serenaded
by the band. Where was anything left
out of this programme? , .
The general plan was to reach a town
in the forenoon and then to march with
all possible show to the hotel that had
been selected. During this march. the
distribution of literature * regarding
Santa Cruz and also the concert pro
grammes and announcements for the
day were, given out, this/distribution
being supplemented later by a v wider
one that took in the portions of city or
LOOK AFTER DETAILS.
As the procession was in Santa Cruz,
so it was everywhere else along the
line of travel. The whole outfit had the
style of a company of visiting min
strels. The band had its glittering
drum major and they played on the
march and also at the long series of
concerts that they gave with vim and
skill.
On A'Til 12 the Santa Cruz Promotion
Committee started on its travels. It
went out of Santa Cruz with flying
colors. Not all the members of the
committee were to make the tour.
The heavy work devolved upon Messrs.
Swanton and Irish, as committee mem
bers. J. W. Anderson patriotically
volunteered to tour the State with tho
party and to handle all their stereo-,
ticon views without charge and he was
on' hard. At the head of the proces
sion â which was destined for some
time thereafter to make a daily ap
pearance in some inland town or city
was a large silken banner that was
carried by a colored man. The banner
was inscribed to tell aÂ». spectators
what , it was there for and informed
them that "this is the New Santa Crua
Tent City Band; this is only one of ten
we have engaged for the season." Also
that "$175,000 in new improvements on
the beach for the season of 1904."
This banner was a gorgeous thing,
and was made the more so by long,
depending yellow ribbons at the corner.
Behind the banner marched Swanton
and Irish, dressed up after the min
strel fashion, their attire being
crowned wkh "champagne" hats. Swan
ton held one of the yellow ribbons of the
banner and Irish clutched th<? other.
Then came the Santa Cruz Promotion
Committee behind the banner and
then, blowing their strongest and beat
ing their drums their loudest, came the
Thirteenth United States Infantry,
band, that had been engaged for the
occasion. Santa Cruz people accom
panied their committee to the special
car, that had been bannered plentiful
ly, so that no one sho* Id doubt what
party it was that was traveling in this
musical fashion from place to place. A
great amount of literature was put In
the special car, where it could be eas
ily reached; then, with a final tune, the
party were off. Boys were in the party
to attend daily to the proper distribu
tion of the literature.
be useful. On the back of the mirror
were the words: "Take a look at youi
eelf now and at New Santa Cruz dur
ing your summer vacation." The mir
rors and snaps 'were provided to the
number of many thousands, so that
every one in every town or city visitod
might set at least one.
WITH LIVELY* FANFARE.
One of these trinkets was a small
affair that can be snapped in imitation
of telegraphic apparatus, and was
greatly coveted by boys . and girls
everywhere. Oh this was an Inscrip
tion: "Your summer vacation will be
a enap If spent in New Santa Cruz."
The word "new" was justified by the
Tiew things that Santa Cruz has pro
vided. The other trinket was a email
mirror, such as any one might find to
Santa Cruz. '
Of course a special car. equipped for
the use of the committee, was the nrÂ«t
thought, and this was duly provided.
Then the unique programme that had
been figured out was unrolled. It com
prised a series of free band concerts
to be given In a great number of Cali
fornia cities in the interior, also free
entertainments,- with accompanying
music, by night, at which views cf
Santa Cruz and of the surrounding
country were to bethrqwn by a stere
opticon upon a screen in public squares.
a spectacular dally parade, one day in
ono place and another day in another
place, one whole day to be given to
each town or city to be visited, and the
free distribution of literature and of
trinkets calculated to best advertise/
SOME CMQUi: IDEAS.
It was proposed to spend $175,000 at
least in improvements on the Santa
Ciuz beach for the entertainment of
the crowds of visitors that are expectel
to flock into Santa Cruz now that the'r
opportunities for enjoyment have bean
increased. In one place the "tented
city" is in creation. A small army of
carpenters and other mechanics have
also toiled to erect, large buildings for
the promotion of bathing and all the
pleasures of the beach and the new
structures make quite a formidable ap
pearance now, In a condition of in
completeness. In this regard the San
ta Cruz people reversed the old adage
which commands that it is well to first
catch a hare before "ou cook It. The
cookery was all provided for in ad
vance and then the Santa Cruz Pro
motion Committee started forth to
catch the hare.
This all around success paved the
way for general acquiescence in the
formation of a Santa Cruz Promotion
Committee and indorsement of its plans
for this season. Mayor Clark repre
sents the Santa Cruz Board of Trade
in its membership; F. K. Roberts rep
resents the Merchants' Association.
Last fall a meeting was held in the
courthouse at Santa Cruz, at which the
question was, "What to do next?"
What was then done also paved the
way for the Santa Cruz Promotion
Committee's unique exploitation.
At the mass-meeting referred to the
subject of establishing a tented city at
Santa Cruz and also the improvement
of the sea beach on a large scale was
mooted. The people caught this idea
and saw that it was good. In three
weeks the sum of $65,000 was raised in
subscriptions for stock of a corporation
that was formed to carry out the pur
pose in view. Many of the best and
most conservative citizens of Santa
Cruz were numbered among the sub
scribers for stock. Indeed, there was a
public awakening. Stock was also sold
in various parts of the State outside
of Santa Cruz.
Trade. i.Â« a member ex-offlcio; H. E.
Irish is the secretary and City Council
man F. K. Roberts, District Attorney
B. K. Knight and T. Wj Kelley, presi
dent of the Young Men's Institute, are
among the members. Swanton and Irish
made a good record last year in connec
tion with the eighty-day carnival at
Santa Cruz. The venture not only paid
its expenses, but came out with a bal
ance at the end of the season. Thirty
thousand persons were reported by the
railway people to have visited Santa
Cruz during the carnival on excursion
tickets. The bank deposits of Santa
Cruz are reported to have grown $700,
000 as the result of the carnival. Every
one made money and every one was
correspondingly happy.

Sonoma County Citizen says:
The City Ci-uncil formally passed the ofJi^

for the lntiÂ»rurban line Into and through Santa

city in advancing Its material welfare. The
only thine to be regretted Is that the franchise
was not granted last tall, that the road could
be in operation this summer.
The construction work is belnr rushÂ»d from

home. Major Sherman said:
"Members of our committee and my
self wish to express our appreciation
of the management of your home. We
have been here since yesterday evening
and have made a thorough examina
tion of everything here. The adminis
tration of affairs and all In charge here
are deserving of the highest praise and
gratitude qt both the veterans of the
Mexican War and of the war for the
Union for the contentment on the part
of the inmates. Nothing Is to be de
sired for additional comfort or food.
There Is not a single complaint from

gratefully of the treatment they re
ceive. Everything possible is done to
make it a happy -home and a cheerful
resting place until all are finally mus

PROF. LIVINGSTONE'S readings are like
a living page of Flammarion's treatise that Is
so electrlfyinc the world to-day. He Is no
Imitator. His work Is upon original lines,
pure thought, clear vision. He tells you what
you desire to know and works in the open
lijht.
He 1b as conspicuous for his wonderful oc-
cult analysis as he is for his original ex-
pression and vivid truthfulness.
A test reading is not a life, reading. When
you call on PROF. LIVINGSTONE he will
give you a full life reading for $1. A test
Is of little value; when the mind is troubled
you need more substantial aid and advice.
This Is Just what PROF. LIVINGSTONE
gives you when you call on him for a first-
class clairvoyant reading.
He asks you no questions, but tells you
what you wish to know.
He does not mention all the ills and mis-
fortunes you are heir to. You are acquainted
with the facts In your case. Let PROF. LIV-
INGSTONE analyze the matters that are
troubling you, find the cause of trouble and
suggest the remedy.

Nine teams entered the competition,
which proved the most interesting yet
held for the handsome challenge cups.
The handicapping was fairly well
close and the matches, as a rule, were
closely contested.
By far the best match of the day
Herbert Schmidt and Harry Rolfe
and Chester Smith and Ray Cornell
were the successful teams In the
handicap doubles tournament yester
day at the California Tenni3 Club. By
playing good, consistent tennis
throughout the day they downed all
their opponents and reached the 'final
round.
Schmidt and Rolfe nnd Smith and Cor
nell Will Meet in Final
Round.
TWO TENNIS TEAMS REMAIN
IN HANDICAP TOURNE^
1 was the one in the semi-final round
between Herbert Schmidt and Harry
Rolfe and Will Allen and R. T. Craw
ford. Both of these teams had won
*the cups and this match meant con
siderable to them.
From the start It could be seen that
the handicap of "owe 2-6," which.
Crawford and Allen allowed, was
about right, though their opponents
won the first four games. Allen and
Crawford did not strike their gait un
til this lead waa scored against them,
but they soon had the score 5-5. From
this time on there was some splendid
tennis, which created much excite
ment among the spectators. After re
quiring but one point to win the set
on three different occasions Rolfe and
Schmidt finally lost by a 13-13 score.
The second set was much the same
as the first. Schmidt and Rolfe took
a long lead at the start, but Allen and
Crawford evened the score at 5-5.
Schmidt and Rolfe took the next two
games handily. In the third set Allen
and Crawford seemed tired and
Schmidt and Rolfe won by a 6-1 score.
Ray Cornell and Chester Smith were
In splendid form in both their
matches. They allowed large handi
caps to Dr. Noble and Pritchard and
Dr. Lovegrove and Daggett. Cornell".-!
smashing and lobbing of both players
was particularly good.
The scores of ths tournament fol

The warm weather of yesterday caused the
waterfront to be almost entirely deserted. The
crowds that usually walk along the wharves,
inspect the ships lying alongside and listen to
the fakers and venders of wares were not
there. It looked like a deserted village. The
boathcuses, however, did a thriving business,
a* everybody as.em*d to want to get out on the
water. The crowds about the Immediate vicin
ity of the ferry building were enormous, and a
special relay of six policemen waa detailed to
keep the throng in order.

Melbourne MacDowell's Marc Antony
has gained greatly In power since the
days when it was subordinated to the
Cleopatra of Davenport. His acting last
night at the Grand Opera-house, while
not that of a great tragedian, was at
least always sincere, and it was often
adequate. The character of the Roman
warrior-statesman, enslaved and be
trayed for love's sake by the snake-like
Queen of Egypt, was well imagined
and clearly suggested. Sardou's six-act
drama "Cleopatra" was staged with
considerable splendor, and the familiar
scenes of temple and palace, the Mem
phian terrace and the thoroughly sat
isfying storm were received by a large
audience with applause. MacDowell's
support is generally competent. Miss
Fuller as the Queen, notwithstanding
the severe cold from which she was
suffering, was really an admirable Cleo
patra, realizing the part in every re
quirement of fpellng and action. Miss
Beldini's Octavla was winning and
convincing, .and it Is to be regretted
that the drama gives her so slight a
role. The Kephren of Robert Elliot pre
sented v the heroic slave with accuracy
to history and much dramatic power.
Of some of the minor members of the
cast the less said the better.
San Francisco's proverbial loyalty to
the stage artist who has pleased her
was again demonstrated last night at
the California Theater, where Ernest
Hastings reappeared after a year's ab
sence from the city and got a reception
that was worth crossing the continent
many times to receive. During his sev
eral seasons as a leading man on
O'Farrell street Mr. Hastings endeared
himself to the matinee girl, and never
was she so numerous at an evening
performance or more applausive at any
time of day than when her Idol made
his first entrance as the Rev. Thaddeus
Strong In "Our New Minister." She
flung flowers and split gloves until he
was compelled to step out of his as
sumed character and eay that he was
ever so glad to be able to again charm
her with his- work. And not satisfied
with thus shattering the atmosphere
of the play, she insisted on having him
repeat is impromptus after the act was
finished. But even if predilection had
not been so strongly at work In his
favor, Mr. Hastings would have made
the Rev. Thaddeus a convincing por
trayal. By personality and tempera
ment he is admirably equipped for -the
part, and never did he appear to be less
of an actor â or so much of one â as
Â¦when by precept and example he
preached the doctrine of humanity. He
is the only notable change in the cast
since the piece was produced here last
winter, and he certainly excels his pre
decessor in every quality that tends to
appropriate characterization. "Our New
Minister" is on for a two weeks' run.
There are many ways of showing
respect for the great. The Orpheum's
way; when the great happens to be a
elnger, is to request the smoker to
turn himself off tor an olio before the
song. The request was out last night:
"Gentlemen will please remain.'.* etc.
It was in hondc of the debut in Amer
ica of Mme. Slapoffski. who dropped
In here last week from Australia and
was engaged immediately on landing
by that astute impresario, John Mor
risey. The clouds of an olio had rolled
by therefore when the singer made her
appearance. There wasn't even a sin
gle floating blue wisp between one and
the particular gorgeousnesa the Or
pheum calls Its best set. when Slap
offski appeared.
Now, Mr. Morrisey may not be a
Maurice Grau, but he has certainly dis
covered a rarely good singer in Mme.
Slapoffski. She sang the "Jewel Song"
from "Faust" in a fashion that showed
her possessed of a brilliant dramatlo
soprano voice, excellently cultivated
and of large compass. She has further
a strong dramatic Instinct and con
siderable magnetism. The voice loses
in the middle range. It is there veiled
and comparatively weak. But tha
singer's high notes are nothing short
of extraordinary, clear, strong, ring
ing, brilliant, and perfectly even in
quality. Opera, evidently, is Slapoff
ski's metier. She had much ado to
refrain from looking at herself in her
handkerchiefâ the only substitute for
Marguerite's mirror at handâ or from
hanging some of the scenery round
her neck for the Mephistophelian Jew
els. She has evidently acted the part
both frequently and well.
A "Goodbye" song then showed the
singer in more somber genre and she
here discovered considerable sympathy
and taste. ',j[i V
The "Song of Thanksgiving" of
Fiances Allitsen again was most dram
atically given. Jj'orty-three operas. I
hear, is Mme. Slapoffski's little reper
toire. Nine years of opera with the fam
ous Carl Rosa Opera Company la among
her experiences and altogether the Or
pheum should be put to It this week
to accommodate the soprano's admir
ers. Her name, by the way, is neither
a Joke nor Russian. She Is "England's
greatest prima donna soprano" and
England might do much worse.
George H. Wood, the somewhat dif
ferent comedian. Is second star at
the newcomers. Mr. -"Wood's matter is
amusingâ and differentâ and his man
ner of setting it forth delightfully droll.
Then there is Clara Ballerlnl, who does
a graceful and daring act on the tra
peze; Sager Midgley and Gertie Car
lisle in another of their quaint Sammy
and Sarah sKatchesâ a trifle slow, and
some clever canines with Slgnor Bal
lerlnl.
The sisters Gasch remain to astonish
with their equilibrist act, with Hal
Davis and Inez Macauley In their live
ly smash-up. "Pals," Brandow and
"Wiley â clever song and dance, and Hal
Merritt in his imitations. It's a good
bill.

Before any civil legislation can be +nÂ«ct*4
which will be operative and quite apart from,
the accord which we are seeking: to secure In
the- man-hire regulations of the Chrtatlan
churches, must come the leavening; o{ the
minds of men and women which shall lift
them toward a recognition of the noblest
dignities or life.
We plead for a recognition of the sanctity
of marriage. We are facing a condition in our
country to-day which threatens danger to the
most sacred things. The -very sanctity of
human life and oC human love Is assaulted
and profaned. Womanhood, manhood and
childhood, the homÂ« and the family are In
volved and neither civil legislation nor
ecclesiastical discipline can save them, until
the conscience of Christian humanity la
reached. Behind the monster of polygamy,
behind the spectacle of the divorce court, with
its collusions. Us corruptions and its con
tagion, stands the sad tact of the low ideal of
marriage.
Marriage is a holy thine;. Marriage Is the
institution of God himself, and is sanctified
under -the solemnities of the old sanction by
our blessed Lord. This Is the root of the
matter. Reformation must begin here. " Chil
dren must be taught It. \ Young men and young
women must be made to feel It. Protected in
purity, boy and girl, man and . woman alike
must be trained to look with reverent eyes
upon the holiness of this estate and upon its
mysterlousnesd as something | higher and
deeper and larger than can be measured or
reached by the low ideas of. convenience, of
worldly advantage, of the gratification of pas
sion, or by the light and easy estimate of the
consent of the passing personal fancy and the
mutual recognition of the civil contract. -
The hooe of curing and crushing the horri
ble tendencies to frequent divorce rtsts, we
believe, upon impressing and inculcating such
Intense conviction of what marriage la and of
what marriage means; that it will cease to
be entered into "unadvisedly *>r lightly":
that the festivity which accompanies it shall
be sobered and consecrated by the conscious
presence of him who adorned and beautified
the marriage at Cana. In Galilee, by his pres
ence, and the first miracle that he wrought:
that neither man nor woman shall dare to
enter the precincts of betrothal . without the
tested certainty of love, with the full recogni
tion cf the mutual duty of service. ! forbear
ance and faithfulness which it Involves.
What words can we find to express the ab
horrence which oueht to rise In righteous In
dignation aealnst the present possibilities and
the existing facts of the divorce habit in
America? Just now polygamous Utah looms
larse and UKly in our minds. But we must
look nearer home to realize the true condition
of things. The proportion of divorces to mar
riages In 1902 In eight Statea reporting statis
tics is as follows: In Maine. 1 to 6; in New
Hampshire, 1 to 8.3: In Vermont, 1 to 10: In
Massachusetts, 1 to 10; In Rhode Island. 1 to
8: in Ohio. 1 to 8.8; In Indiana. 1 to 7.6: In
Michigan. 1 to 11. In these States there has
been a steady and rapid increase in the di
vorces during the decade, and thiB Increase Is
believed to be true of the country at large.
The fear of legalized polygamy In one State
is enhanced by the fact of unholy divorce in
many States. The voices of Christian people
must be lifted against tht?, not only to se
cure civil legislation, not only to enforca
church discipline, but to correct the tendency,
to control the Inclination and to condemn the
fact. We are pleading for the home, for th-Â»
family, for the children born and to be born,
for the protection of society and for the pren
ervatlon o* the state. We ask you to unite
with us In earnest effort, bo that more and
more the manhood, the womanhood and thÂ»
childhood of America may make itself heard
and felt. In the determined purpose to stem
the currents which are papplng the foundation
of all that is best and holiest and dearest in
human life.
PHILADELPHIA, May* 8.â The In
terchurch Conference on Marriage and
Divorce, a body representing officially
fourteen leading denominations, has is
sued through Its secretary. Rev. Will
iam II. Roberts, D. D., an appeal to
the public calling attention to several
aspects of the divoce question.
The paper Is the beginning of a na
tional campaign of education on the
subject, to be followed by efforts to se
cure the enactment of laws in the State
Legislatures, and ultimately, it Is
thought, of an amendment to the con
stitution of the United States.
' Already action has been taken by
the conference looking toward the pre
vention or the remarriage by ministers
of other communions, of divorcees
whom clergymen of their own faith
have refused to marry.
This movement .is the first occasion'
of any sort upon. which the representa
tives of the great denominations have
officially come together. The members
of the conference include many of the
most eminent ecclesiastics and laymen
in the churches.
Dr. Roberts said in part:
She brings 12,291 bags of sugar -and
45 bundles of hides to Hind, Rolph &
Co.
The schooner Defender arrived In
port late yesterday afternoon after a
voyage of thirty-eight days from
Puako, Hawaiian Islands. Much.ap
prehension had been felt about the
stanch little vessel,' as she usually
makes tho run in about twenty days.
The longest run she had ever made
previously was twenty-four days, so
there was some alarm for her safety.
Captain Hellingsen reports that the
reason for the long passage was that
for nine days after leaving Puako lack
of winds caused him to remain in eight
of that place. On the tenth day, how
ever, he got under way and experi
enced light northerly airs for the rest
of the voyage. .

Jose won the twelfth renewal of the
California Associated Cyclists* historic
relay race yesterday in three and two
fifths seconds outside the best previous
record. Ten riders, each covering ten
miles, covered the hundred-mile route
in four hours, forty-two minutes and
forty-three and two-fifths seconds.
The New Century Wheelmen finished
second, the Oakland Wheelmen third
and the Bay City Wheelmen fourth.
The New Century Wheelmen were dis
qualified and were placed fourth for
starting David Mainland, who was not
entered in the race and who was not
eligible to enter. The California Club
started a team, but its first man fell
and lost his packet. The team did not
finish.
The Garden City Wheelmen assumed
thp lead at the start and were never
headed but once during the race. This
was in t^ie second relay when Mainland
beat 'Murphy fifteen seconds. The Gar
den City courier finished first In San
Jose by five minutes and the Garden
City man reached the finish four min
utes and fifteen seconds ahead of his
nearest competitor.
The Bay City riders lost on this side
c-f the bay, being 2 minutes and 30
seconds behind at the end of the third
relay, and 6 minutes behind at San
Jc-se. C. Long made up 1 minute and
40 seconds of this through San Jose,
equaling Burton Downing's record of
27:10. L. Magginni equaled L. Smith's
record of 26:00 made in 1S99 on the
fourth relay. P. Borree of the Oakland
wheelmen rode the 8th relay in 26:45,
replacing A. P. Deacon's record of
27:10 made in 1S97. C. Hi Clark of the
Bay City Wheelmen covered the 9th
relay in 26:25, replacing J. Hobson's
record of 23:05. A. Trout of the New
Century Wheelmen, who rode the last
relay, beat Lace Downing's record of
26:30, covering the distance in 25:54.
O. L. Pickard, a veteran racing man,
and A:Yonce followed the entire race
on motor cycles. This is the first time
the feat has been accomplished. It has
been claimed the motors w-ould not
stand such severe work, but this proves
their practicability.

pacemaklng, the winner especially re
ceiving no assistance. . .
The race was admirably handled by
the racing and records committee of
the association, C. L. McEnerney,
chairman: F. W. Smith. B. D. Balart,
M. M. Mnffit and H. L. Delaney. The

During the -racing season which closed
at Oakland on Saturday last th'e pa
trons of The Call were given more win
ners than were ever furnished in past
years by a newspaper. The horses were
chosen on form and through private
sources of information gleaned by the
racing editor, Fred E. Mulholland.
On seven occasions The Call came
within one of picking the entire card.
In all 204 winning horses were selected,
which is an average of a shade better
than two winners a day for the long
season of 150 days. Repeatedly the sec
ond and third choices picked were suc
cessful at long odds.
The record of the newspaper handi
cappers follows:

Angels enjoyed themselves immensely
while they were engaged in the little
liacas with the locals. Th?ir headlong
rush at the end of the week won
for'-them the series and put them with
in striking: distance of second place.
The bis Doc opened up the game
â¢with passes galore, for he was as wild
Â£s c any Sioux chief. "He had a bad
night." quoth some, and others thought
it must be stage fright. At all events
his wildness ceased as soon as men
got on bases and he became busy and
â¢showed the fans a few.
The Angels reached Mr. Jones in the
fjfth. Chase singled, but Spies forced,
him at second. He stole" and arrived
on Toman's single to left. In their half
of* the/ same round th? locals got their
only run. Leahy made those present
gla'J with a two-base cJout to left. Hil
tlebrand shot one to Flood and the ball
"took a_ bad bounce, going out to right.

From early morning, when the sun

of the exquisite weather. , The Â¦ cars
were Jammed and there were strings

The park in its spring loveliness was
visited also by great and delighted
numbers and merriment, mirth, : music,

There is no apparent change In the
condition of the strike of fhe stablemen
and the lock-out of the hackmen. Both
sides are firm and the indications are,
according to the officers of the two
unions and the Stable and Carriage
Owners' Association, that no steps will
be taken for several days by the men
involved to bring about a settlement.
Several conferences were held bej
tween the officers of the stablemen'3,
the horseshoers' and the hackmen's
unions yesterday, but nothing was ac
complished. The stablemen decided
Saturday night to stand on their, orig
inal demands and will also stand by
the horseshoers.
According to the statement issued by
the Owners' Association, to-morrow i3
the last day for the horseshoers to re
turn to work under the old system. If
that is not done (and the men say it
will "not be done) new men will be
brought from the East at once to tak?
their places. It is the intention of the
union men to warn the horseshoers
throughout the East to keep away
from San Francisco and to endeavor
to induce all men that do come here
to Join the union.
M. W. Coffey, president of the Hack
men's Union, was busy all day yester
day with the. different labor leaders in
the qity, and expressed belief that the
union would win out in the end as its
members had been locked out by the
owners and had not gone out of their
own accord.
The horseshoers do not intend, at the
present, at least, to go back to work
while the trouble is pending, with the
drivers. Some of the men are anxious
to settle the differences at once and ef
forts will be made to-day to bring that
about. As ' the trouble stands at the
present time, it is a triangular affair
with the owners at each corner. With
the backing oÂ£ the Citizens'Alllance the
owners expect to dictateXhe terms upon
which the man can return to work.
There is very little Indication of a com
promise being reached.

Alfred Wilkins, formerly a clerk
employed at the tobacco stand at Fifth
and Howard streets, has been missing:
for a fortnight from his home and
family. On Saturday, April 23,. he left
home with 51 in his pocket and his
wife has not since heard of him. He
left her and their two children in des
titute circumstances. Mrs. Wilkins
says that he was in good health and
had no family troubles or other cause
for worrying, so far as she knows, ex
cept that he had not been able of late
to obtain regular employment. For sev
eral days before he left, she adds, he
seemed to have something on his mind
that he would not tell her, fearing to
cause her trouble.
Wilkins is about 47 years old, of
medium height and build.""- He- has a
sandy mustache^ and brown, hair. -He
is a native of Janesville, Wis., and has
lived in Charles City, Iowa. Mrs. Wil
kins believes he may have gone East
in hope of obtaining employment.
Their home, up to the time of his dis
appearance, was at 1632*Folsom street,
but since then the wife has taken her
children to a room at 716 Turk street,
in order to be nearer her employment.

The plan' to illuminate the lower
portion -of Geary street, between
Kearny and Powell, by arc lights will
be carried into effect to-night. Yes
terday, the Central Light and Power
Company, which has the contract for
the lighting, had a gang of men em
ployed along . the street in. front of
Union Square, erecting iron poles, from
which the lights^on^tha^ side of the
street will be hung, and* It expects to
have this work completed early this
afternoon. " /
The company's contract.- 'provided
that the street should be illuminated
last Saturday' night,' but the power
company was unexpectedly confronted
by an obstacle in the shape of an ob
jection from the Pacific Bell Tele
phone Company to the' use of its poles
in front of Union Square. As a re
sult the Board of Supervisors had to
be appealed to for a permit to erect
separate poles. There will be forty
seven arc lights along the sides of the
street, directly over the sidewalks.
The plan is part of a general one in
augurated by the Geary-street Im
provement Club for bettering the con
ditions of that thoroughfare.

dirty and the attending physicians have
grave fears that blood poison will set
in, in which event death is sure to
result.
Professor McAdle's figures for yester
day's highest were two degrees above
the previous maximum for the -sum
mer. On April 10 he recorded 84 degrees
as the high point. The addition of, the
two degrees yesterday made more dif
ference than most people expected,
especially In view of the fact that the
fierce sun was not tempered by any
cooling breeze. What stray breaths of
air there were came from the east.
They brought to the city dwellers, a re
minder that the great valleys of the
Sacramento and the San Joaquin are
already settling down to business for
the summer, and that the wheat fields,
vineyards and orchards, where lies the
wealth of the Jitate, are, under the fer
vid rays of old Sol, preparing another
harvest exceeding in riches the mines
of the Sierras. Throughout the valleys
the thermometers stood at 90 or a little
higher.,
So far as the coast was concerned,
however, the hot wave was not a wide
one. San Francisco had to bear the.
brunt of it, the cities both north and
south getting off with several degrees
less. Everywhere west of the Rockies
the temperature was lower than in San
Francisco, which thus enjoyed â rather
did not enjoy â the rare experience of
being the hottest town on the Pacific
slope.
The residents of the city made it evi
dent that they appreciated the situa
tion. The rush to the park, the beach
and to near-by resorts across the bay
is reported by railway and- steamboat
authorities to have established a new
record â a record tha,t testified not only
to the oppressiveness of life within
doors under the unusual heat, but to
the rapid growth of the city. All day
long the cable and electric people had
their hands full, and success in reach
ing the Cliff or Golden Gate Park meant
a preliminary period of torture In over
crowded cara. Once at the park or the
seaside, however, the perspiring multi
tude found enjoyment unalloyed in the
cooler airs that failed to reach the
heart of the city. ~ â
All . down the beach* from the Cliff
House the strand was crowded for
more than a mile with thousands and
tens of thousands of men, women and
children â especially children â who
thronged as closely as possible to the
cool waters of the ocean. In the park
every ehady walk and grove was hunt
ed out by loitering pleasure seekers,
who sought refuge from the heat of
the sun. At every ferryand boat land
ing crowds gathered to make their
flight across the bay to places of rec
reation and more endurable tempera
ture. Thev knew that up on Tamal
pais, where the thermometer reached
only 78, there would be a bracing wind
with life in it. A few boarded fishing
craft or strav boats for the far-away
Farallones, where they needed, their
overcoats, the mercury declining to go
above 63 at the hottest part of the day.
The crowds crossing the bay to dif
ferent points were the greatest known
in the city for many years. Every boat
to Oakland, Alameda, Berkeley And to
points adjacent to Sausalito and- San
Rafael ferries was packed from early
dawn up till 3 o'clock p. m.
Sergeant Mahoney, who for many
years has had charge of the forces at
the Ferry building, said that in all the
firne he had been there he had never
seen anything: like the crowds that
passed through the gates yesterday. v
The exodus to the Sausalito and Mill
Valley district was unprecedented,
crowds beginning to arrive, there as
early as 9 o'clock. Every car on the
Mount Tamalpais road was brought
into service, and even then it was
found difficult to transport - the unex
pected volume of business. Besides' the
people who went by train to Tamal
pais, there were several hundred who
made the ascent afoot. *
. Yesterday was the hottest day of the
season. The Government thermome
ters on top of the Mills building regis
tered 86 degrees aUthe middle of the
afternoon. This would be mild for St.
Louis, Washington, New York or Chi
cago, even thus early in the summer,'
but it made the average denizen of the
Pacific Coast metropolis "kick." San
Franciscans, who are blessed with some
Imagination, were yesterday enabled by
a slight exercise of that faculty to
realize what life is in the Eastern
cities during about five months of the
year.
The evening sessions of the reunion
will occur at the Academy of Sciences,
where interesting medical and dental
papers, illustrated by the stereopticon,
will be read and fully discussed.
. Nearly a hundred clinics have been
arranged for. These will be given by
prominent members of the profession
in California and from other States.
As attendance of fully 500 is expected.
Manufacturers from all parts of the
United States will exhibit novelties
lately introduced, as well as standard
goods. To these exhibitors Wednesday,
the third day of the session, will be
given over. Many of the visitors will
attend the graduating exercises of the
dental department at the new Greek
Theater at Berkeley.
The State Association of California
Dentists. and the Alumni Association of
the Dental Department- of the Univer
sity of .. California will this year, combine
their annual meetings. A joint session
and'union clinic will be held'on'May 16
to 19 inclusive, these dates having been
selected to avoid conflict with the In
ternational'Dental Congress, which will
occur at St. Louis beginning on August
1. The day sessions, which are to be
entirely devoted to clinics embodying
all - that is novel and noteworthy in
dentistry, will be held In the rooms of
the Dental Cc-llege at Market and Tay
lor streets, this city.
Many prominent members of the pro
fession will take part in the meeting.
Among them will be Dr. Hart T. Gos
lee, Dr. W. Van B. Armes, Dr. C. S.
Case. Dr. P. M. Wuillemin and Dr. R.
C. Brophy, all of Chicago. Competent
experts will ;. give continuous demon
strations throughout the session of new
processes, including the latest uses of
porcelain in dental practice, as well as
of plastic gold and a gutta percha ce
ment for bridgework. Dr. Ames, an
expert upon the use of cement in den
tistry, will explain the results of hia
recent investigations and will intro
duce a novel feature in porcelain inlay
processes. Dr. Wuillemin will disduss
the use of nitrous oxide gas. Dr. Bro
phy will demonstrate the utility of gas
oline for fusing porcelain and for sold
ering. Prof. Calvin. S. Case, a special
ist in orthodontia, will demonstrate his
methods not only in correcting irregu
larities of the teeth but in "improving
the outlines and contour of the face.
Prof. Goslee has a wide reputation up
on the modern aspects of porcelain
dental art.
Charles Miller, 1309 Devisadero street,
vandered around the Richmond district
aT an early hour this morning in a nude
condition and with a deep gash in his
throat, self-inflicted. The unfortunate
rr.an was nearly dead from exposure
end loss of blood when Patrolman
Walsh found him lying in the gutter
In fror.t of the Geary street car house.
Fourth and Point Lobos avenues.
How Miller managed to wander from
his home to the Richmond district in
Â¦uch a condition is a mystery. He was
first eeen by a fireman in the engine
"house at Locust and First avenues.
The fireman notified Patrolman Walsh
end the latter started off to find the un
fortunate creature. VTalsh walked
several blocks before he discovered, the
wounded man in the gutter in front
6i the car house.
Miller was unconscious from exposure
end loss of blood and at first he was
thought to be dead. He regained con
eeiousnes? after some minutes and was
n moved to the 1'ark Emergency Hos
pital, and later to the Central Emer
gency Hospital.
" At first the unfortunate man refused
.U> talk, but finally he admitted to Chief
"Surgeon Miller that he had become de
rpondent after a weeks debauch and
had cut hia throat with a small pen
lcr.ife and then wandered about the
Kircets naked.
He presented a ghastly sight when
taken to the hospital. He appeared to
have lost his reason and acted like a
rhild that did not understand what had ;
happened.
Upon examination it was discovered
that the wour.ds which Miller had in
flicted in his throat are not necessarily
fatal, but the knife was rusty and

Yesterday morning H.- A. .Grenman
and his son Bert, who live near Ba
kers, Beach, saw. the body of a man
lying on the beach at the , foot of a
cliff, about. 200 feet high, near Lands
End. They notified the Morgue, *and
Deputy Coroner Fennell drove "the
wagon as close to the scene as possible.
A rope had to be procured, and after
it r was tied to a rock on top of the
cliff Fennell and' Grenman- descended,
mid after Â¦ fastening r the body to the
end of the rope it was pulled up by the
crowd that had gathered and conveyed
to the Morgue. Edward Heins, who
has .av peanut stand at Lands End,
saw" the victim seat himself on i the
edge of the cliff about nine o'clock
yesterday morning. It was supposed
at Jirst that he had accidentally fallen
to the bottom, but Ivan P. Shutich,
president t?f Waiters* Union No. 30;
who identified the body as that of; M.
Marinovich, said that Marinovich had
told him two or three weeks ago that
he was tired of life. Marinovich used
to'be secretary of the union.
â¢L. C. Gram, yardmaster of the South
ern Pacific Company, â¢- notified the
Morgue yesterday morning that the
body of a man had been discovered
under an empty freight car at Fifth
and Townsend streets. Deputy Coroner
McCormick went for the body, and it
was so tightly jammed that the wheels
of the car had to be taken off before
it could be dragged out. The man had
met death e"arly yesterday morning,
while a train of empty cars was being
shunted alongside the sheds at Fifth
street to be loaded. He had evidently
been struck at Fourth street and drag
ged a block. There was nothing
in his pockets that would give a clew
to his identity. He was about 35 years
of age and his clothing showed that he
had been a laboring man.
The Journeymen butchers of the P.
and B. Associatlon^migrated In swarms
of thousands with .their wives, chil
dren and friends to El Campo yester
day, where they spent the entire day
playlag games and wandering about the
green hills.
As the day was perfect, many more
people attended the picnic than were at
first expected and the large river
steamer. J. D. Peters, was kept busy
transporting the pleasure seekers to
the scene of festivities.
The happy feeling of recreation pre
vailed over the entire crowd from the
moment that the big: steamer started
on her first trip to El Campo until she
tied up at the Washington street dock
after having delivered the last load of
people to the city. The piano on board
was kept busy working all day and
those that could sing or play other In
struments crowded around.
At the camp luncheon was served,
after which the picnickers contested for
bowling prizes. Many high scores were
rolled and the following eleven men re
ceived prizes: Miller, Marks, Miesner,
Blumenthal, Pachtner. Osswalt, Jar
ders, Toni, Behling, Johnson and Baker.
A vote was next taken to decide who
was the most popular boss butcher in
the city. John W. Danz received the
highest number of votes. There are to
be 166 prizes awarded to those whose
tickets bore lucky numbers. The prizes
will be given out to-day at the Bay
City Market.
