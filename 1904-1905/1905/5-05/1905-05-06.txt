CONCLUSIOXS REACHED.
"I conclude therefore that any. law
for the fixing, of .rates, according tolthe
standard- of reasonableness,- impartial
ity and'justlce, or any action taken by
a subordinate administrative body, in
the execution of such a law,' would 'not
be obnoxious to Particle" 1," section -9.
paragraph- 6 of the constitution, even
if it resulted In-dissimilar rates.toand
from the ports of different States.
"The -views' which'.l have expressed
may be stated briefly as follows:
"1. There is a governmental power*
to fix the maximum future charges of
carriers by railroad, vested In the
Legislatures of the States with j regard
to transportation "within
the States,- and vested in Congress 'with
regard to, all other transportation.
*" "2. :..., Although "legislative " power,
properly speaking; cannot be delegated,
the lawriaking body ; having enacted*
into law the standard of charges which
shall control, may ,' intrust to -ah" ad

true sense judicial power" the. duty, to
fix rates in conformity; with that stand

WAGONS WILL BE GUARDED
WASHINGTON, May 6.â Attorney
General Moody to-day submitted an
exhaustive opinion to Senator Ellcins.
chairman of the Senate Committee on
Interstate Commerce, as to the con
stitutionality of Government control of
railway rates. The opinion was pre
pared at the request of the Senate
committee, and in it Moody holds that
there is nothing in the constitution
v.hich prohibits such Government con
trol. It is stated by the Attorney Gen
eral that such power belongs exclusive
ly to the legislative branch of the Fed
eral Government, and not to the ju
dicial department.
"Your letter, supplemented by oral
communication, calls upon me 4:0 con
sider the governmental power to regu
late the operations of - railroads, es
pecially in the respect of fixing rates
for transportation, by whom that
power, so far as it exists in the Na
tional Government, may be exercised
constitutionally, and what limits to the
poH er, if any, are prescribed by the
constitution. .â"\u25a0Â»\u25a0'
"After great consideration, it was
settled in the group of cases com
monly called^ the Granger cases, that
there- is a gox-ernhiemaJ. power -to regn- '
late the operations of railroads acting
&s common carriers and. as a part of
6 uch regulation, to prescribe the maxi
mum rates .which they may charge in
the future for the services which they
shall render to those who resort to
them, and that the power is vested in,
and may be exercised by, the legisla
tive branch of the Government.
"Under the division of the govern
mental power made by the constitu
tion of the United States, the authority
to regulate the charges of railroads, so
far as those charges are made for traf
fic which is exclusively within the'
States, resides in the Legislatures of
the States, and so far as they are, made
for other traffic, resides in Congress.
SOT A JUDICIAL FUNCTION.
"Rate-making is purely a legislative
function, in the performance of Which
the legislative body may avail itself
of the aid of an administrative body for
the execution in detail of general rules
\u25a0which have been enacted Into law.
This is only another form of saying
that the rate-making power Is not a
judicial function.
"Assuming, then, that the rate-maW
ing power is a legislative function and
not a judicial function, it follows neces
sarily that, under our scheme of gov
ernment. Congress has not the right to
vest it in the courts either by- con
ferring original or appellate jurisdic-'
tion over the subject.
"A case arising under the laws ' of
Kansas signally illustrates the princi
"ple that the nature of legislative and
judicial r>owers is such that they, can
cot be joined together and vested in the
same body consistently with the theory
that underlies the constitution of the
United States and those of many, If not
ell, of the States. A law of Kansas had
created a Court" of Visitation and
united in that court many : functions
wblch were clearly legislative in 'their
nature with those which were clearly
judicial in their nature. Among other
powers conferred upon the court were
the legislative and administrative
power to fix railway and telegraph
rates. For the reason that this law at
tempted to vest In one body both leg
islative and judicial powers it was held
unconstitutional by the Circuit Court
cf the United States.
"I conclude, therefore, that Congress
cannot confer, consistently with the
principles of the Â» constitution, upon a
court of the United States, either by
way of original or appellate jurisdic
tion, the power, to -fix and determine
railway rates for the future..
â¢ ' CONSTITUTION APPLIED.
"Although the rate-making \u25a0 power
must be exercised by Congress and its
administrative agencies. : subject -to
every constitutional limitation upon
the legislative power, the' only: other
provision of that Instrument which
seems now to call for consideration is
that contained in article one. section 9,
paragraph six. which Is as , follows: :;Â£ ,
"'No preference ehall-be/giveri^by.
any regulation of commerce or; revenue
to the uorts of; one. State over those; of
another; nor shall vessels \ bound- to" or
from one ; State be obliged to -, enter,
clear or pay-duties in another-UnttHtt
"The history of the origin of ; this
clause, disclosed . In the proceedings 'of
the coistltutional convention. , ; shows
that the port preferences then" under
consideration, which it was desired to
prohibit, were only such as would* re
sult from discriminatory legislation
with regard to the navigation of yes- I
sels, or the privilege and restrictions
which might be given or imposed upon
them or .their freight.*
"It is clear that the port preferences
forbidden by this clause are only those
which are direct in their operation" and
effect; and remembering that a port, is
not the city which is built about It,but
the waterway itself. It la not ; easy to
pee how. any , regulation of commerce
which is not directed Â» toward the use
of the waterway . itselfâ but, on the
other hand; Is confined s in , its , direct
tperation and effect to land transporta-

The, event at Cheyenne this
year was the remarkable feat of
"Will" Pickett, a negro hailing "from !
Taylor, Tex., who" gave his exhibition !
while twenty thousand people watched j
with wonder and admiration a mere
man, unarmed and without a device
or appliance of any kind, attack a
fiery, wild-eyed and powerful steer
and throw it by, his teeth. With the
aid of a helper .Pickett chased the
steer until he was . in . front of the 1
grandstand. Then he Jumped from i
the saddle and landed on the. back of '
the animal, grasped its horns and
brought it to a stop within a dozen feet.
By a remarkable display of strength he
twisted the steer's head until its nose
pointed straight into the air. the ani
mal bellowing with pain and its tongue
protruding in. its effort to secure; air.
Again and again the negro was 'jerked
from his feet and tossed, into the air,
but his grip on- the horns never once
loosened, and the steer failed in its. ef
forts to gore him.- Cowboys with their!
lariats rushed to Pickett's assistance,'
but the action of the;cornbat was too
rapid for them. Before help could be
given Pickett, who * had Â£ forced ; the
steer's nose into the mud and : shut
on* its : wind,, slipped, and was' tossed
aside like a piece-of paper.;' There was
a scattering of cowboys Tas' ; he Jumped
to his feet and ran for, his horse. 'Tak^
ing the saddle without touching, the \
. stirrup, he ran the .steer tola point ;
opposite the judges' stand, again Jump
ed on its . back i. and threw, it." j ( Twlce
wasthe negro lifted from his feet, but
he held on with theHenacityof a bull
i dog. Suddenly 1 Pickett dropped ,1 the
\ steer's head and grasped, the, upper -lip
i of the animal with his teeth, .threw his
arms wide apart to show that he was
not using his hands, and sank \u25a0 slowly
i upon his back. The steer, lost j its '\u25a0 t oot- "
j ing and rolled upon its back, complete-;
| ly covering the negro's. bpdy with Its
'own. The crowd was speechless 'vwlth
horror, many! believing that* the -negro
had been crushed;*but 'a: second later,

i ST. PETERSBURG, May 5.â Ad 7 !
miral Rojestvensky, according to a
naval authority, has' sailed south to
meet the division of the Russian sec
' ond Pacific squadron commanded by
i Admiral Nebogatoff. The Admiralty
'has information that a" Japanese di
vision of fast cruisers and torpedo
boat destroyers wasvsent south for the,
purpose, if posible, of crippling or de
stroying Nebogatoff's - ships before
they could effect a junction with those
of Rojestvensky and there is reason to
believe that the Japanese took up a
position In the Straits of Sunda,
through which Nebogatoff originally
intended to make the passage into the
China Sea. There is also reason to
believe that Nebogatoff first approach
ed the Straits of Sunda, but finding
them too well guarded, put about and
headed north for the Straits of Malac
ca, his division lacking the protection
of fast cruisers and being at great dis- .
advantage in meeting torpedo-boat at-
I tacks. - . !
The Admiralty expresses much
; gratification at the fact that Admiral
Nebogatoff has successfully reached â¢'
j the China Sea, but appreciates that '
the composition of his division ren-
I ders it particularly vulnerable to a 1a 1
I swift adversary, especially as the '
I crews of his ships have not had the }
training in maneuvering or the" target

I sky's crews had while off the island of '

TOKIO, May 6, 4 a. m. â Four Rus
sian torpedo-boat destroyers from
Vladivostok appeared westward of
Hokkaido, off Sntsu, yesterday (Fri
day). They seized and burned a small
mailing' vessel and imprisoned the cap
tain and disappeared to the north
avert. They were evidently returning
to Vladivostok. There is a possibility
that they have destroyed other small
craft, although no reports to that ef
fect have been received. The object
of their visit is not clear. It is
thought that they hoped to torpedo
the Japanese patrol at night and it is
alM> suggested that the Vladivostok
lessel^ plan a diversion to assist the
fleet* of" Admiral Itojestvensky.
.SAIGON, Cochin China, May sâ The
l iussian division near Honkoke Bay, a
ehort distance north of Kamranh Bay,
was on May 2 preparing: to leave its I
mopriaSÃ the following day. Admiral
Heiestvensky had previously informed j
the French authorities of its proposed i
departure. '
â¢ LONDON. May 5.â A dispatch to a j
news agency from St, Petersburg: says
Admiral Rojestvensky has informed the j
Russian admiralty of the presence of ;
Japanese warships in the territorial |
waters of the Dutch portion of the .
Island of Borneo. If the reports are
verified, it Is added, Russia will pro
test to The Netherlands Government.
The Russian armored cruiser Gromo
boi, it is announced from St. Peters
burg, has left Vladivostok.
TOKIO. May s.â Popular attention is
row centered on the presence of the
second Russian Pacific squadron in
French waters. While the assurances
of France relating to the Kamranh Bay
incident were generally accepted, the
later discovery that the Russian ships
continued their stay at Kamranh Bay,
and then entered other French ports,
has created a feeling of keen ' disap
pointment, rapldiy growing deeply re
sentful. The local press charges France
with bad faiti an 3 r.p.ats the demands
lor. independent action upon the part
tit th? Japanese Government. The con- j
Bervative element is awaiting France's
lespont-e in explanation, hoping that
that Government will finally expel Ad
miral Rojestvensky from its waters.
>- ATTITUDE OF FRANCE. i
PARIS. May 5. â The Japanese rep- '
resentatives here continue to make al
most daily visits to the Foreign Office
for the purpose of learning what s^eps
are being taken, to compel, the Rus
sian second Pacific squadron to main
tain the neutrality of French waters
and also to present the information
reaching Tokio showing that the Rus- .
.Â«3an warships are receiving supplies
from French ports. These visits have ,
led to the publication of reports that
Dr. Motono, the Japanese Minister,
has submitted another protest on the j
subject. This is not correct, the visits !
as yet not having resulted in a re- j
newal of the Japanese protest. How- !
ever, it is evident that the Japanese
are showing growing solicitud*. and j
their repeated visits give a more !
pressing character to the representa- ;
tions oach day concerning the location ,
of the Russian ships. j
It appears to be conceded that they i
are outside the three-mile limit, so the !
question no longer hinges upon their !
being within French territorial waters. !
But the Japanese information mdi- j
cates that the Russians, while they j
are outside neutral limits, keep up :
communication with the shore, thus j
retaining the practical advantages of i
remaining inside neutral waters. Ad

morning, accompanied by Thomas
O'Brien, proprietor of the Henshaw
of this city.
j While there have been rumors of
t Crowe's presence in the vicinity of
! Omaha, for several days, the rumors
I were taken by Ihe public in a manner
j similar to former reports and were j
* given little credence. " |
| . Crowe telegraphed to the World-Her- |
! aid office at midnight of his I presence
in the city, and stated that he would
call at the â¢ newspaper office. A short
time afterward he appeared, in^ ccmi-'
,pany with O'Brien: Crowe, O'Brien
and; a representative of the World-
Herald were closeted for nearly an
hour, during which time. Crowe told
of his wanderings since he left the city
four years ago. ; '_
Crowe stated that he had . served in
the Boer war; "fighting with the Boers.
He returned to this country â¢ after the
war and has lived. continually, accord
ing to his statement, quietly in a suuth
side flat in Chicago. He says he has
been in Chicago nearly three years and
that he has visited Omaha; on three
.different- occasions during that time.
Ho 'stated that he had been nego
tiating for. several days for Immunity
from punishment In case he, should
surrender, himself to: the authorities,
although . he declined :to say with
l% whom the negotiations are being held.
jHe says. he is. tired of living in |sola
1 tion from his relatives and friends and i
wishes to reform and get jj into busi- |
j ness. " He declared that he would ask j
j fqr immunity from, ' the penitentiary I
[ and stated that he was ready to ac
cept the protection of the Omaha po
lice. He said that in case he was
permitted to remain in Omaha and
I the indictments against him were
quashed, he would get into business
at once.
I Crowe was asked if he had a hand
In the famous Cudahy kidnaping, but
declined to cither- deny or admit his
guilt. During the interview Crowe
Was apparently ill at ease.
Following the interview Crowe left
for the home of his brother in Council

WASHINGTON. May s.â Secretary
Taft to-day caLled Governor Davis at
Panama to return at once to the Unit
ed States, placing Colonel Gorgas in
charge of the administration of the
canal zone until the arrival there of
Governor Magoon. Governor Davis Is
suffering from malaria, and his physi
cians advised him to leave the isthmus
to recuperate. He has resisted their
appeals, however, fearing that his sud
den departure at a time when the
health conditions on the isthmus are
adverse would be misunderstood. The
report that determined Secretary Taft
to summon him home was the follow
ing cablegram from Colonel Gorgas.
dated at Panama to-day:
"Four yellows In hospital. Xone since
Hay l. Outbreak under control. Gen
eral conditions excellent. Have advised
home health May 16." -
It ts the Secretary's intention to ap
point General Davis one" of the board
of consulting engineers, which will
consist of twelve members, eight ' of
whom have already been selected.
. The Secretary plans to have the ex
ecutive committee of the Canal Com
mission, consisting â¢ of Chairman
Bhonts. Governor Magoon and Chief
Engineer Wallace, sail for the Isthmus
on May 16. They will be followed by
the remaining members of the com
mittee on July 1. and the entire body
will make a thorough examination of
condlttions on the Isthmus, with par
ticular reference to the formation of
plans for the conduct of the work of
canal conf traction. It will consider
the important question of tide level or
lock canal.
These plans will be submitted
through Secretary Taft to the Board
of Consulting Engineers, which will be
called in session for the first time in
\u25a0Washington on September 1 or 15 next.
Secretary Taft feels that two months"
time will be sufficient to enable the
board to form final plans upon which
can h* based a Presidential recom
mendation to Congress at the next ses
sion.

spell is being taken in \ numerous lines
of trade and industry; pending the ad
vent- of.s ettled \u25a0 weather,- clearer ; views
of the'croi) '.'outlook^atid the'settlenient
of the Chicago strike. Heavy rains 'or
cool weather have retarded corn and
cotton crop preparations' and.; 'retail ]
trade, but have rather favored -winter
wheat, which fully holds the* magnifi
cent promise of a- month ago) while an
increased area is certain 'in spring
wheat, which latter, however, ; needs
more moisture.. .Iron and steel;: are
rather quieter as regards new business,
and increased ease is rioted in old ma
terial, pig Iron and bars, but structural,
material is eagerly bid for, and large
orders for rail way ., bars I guarantee ac
tivity for -the ; mills , for months^ to
come. The' building trades and" allied
lines, such as lumber, 1 hard ware, paints
and glass, , are: apparently, doing the
business of their lives,' unchecked : and
untouched by the: usual May day labor

, talked of. / It was written from an American standpoint, making
it ;of greatest practical value in our everyday life. -
.Xi It is the sum of the knowledge . contained in all the
. older encyclopaedias, pins the knowledge since acquired. ' ,
41; Its preparation was no small matter hastily undertaken, but a.
work designed^to supply the reading and thinking world of seekers \
after accurate knowledge with an encyclopaedia that would answer
\u25a0 every requirement ; that may \u25a0be quoted -as absolute authority.
{^ The reputation of the publishers, one of the oldest and best

they have had the work well done and â¢ that it is just > what they
claim it to be.

BERKELEY, May s.â Although the
Stanford "co-eds" tied the women stu
dents" of the University of California
in the basket ball games played by the
two teams this seison, the California
maidens regard themselves as entitled
to the championship because of the
default of the Stanford girls to come
forward and play the third and decid
ing game.
This third game was to have been
played, according to the original sched
ule, at "Berkeley to-morrow morning.
The first game of the series was played
Jn Hearst Hall on the university cam
pus at Berkeley and this game the Cal
ifornia players captured by the score
of 12 to 6. Then the California girls
journeyed to Stanford a week later,
but at Palo Alto they met defeat, al
though by a closer score than that of
the first game. .
Now the Stanford girls should play
the concluding match, but they are un
a')]e to come for various reasons.
There is no set code of rules that
determines who may be entitled to the
championship under these circum
stances, but the best judges declare
that California may fairly make claim.
The university girls are sportswomen
enough to waive the title and to say
that in the absence of a decisive game
they will share basket ball honors for
this season with the maidens who
flaunt the cardinal as their color.
The California team is composed of
the following players: Misses Lily
Wright '07, Mamie Rigney '05 and
Lillian Williams '06. forwards; Flor
ence Atkinson *05 <captain), Helen
EBchenberg '08 and Leila' Boynton '05,
centers; Marie Grifflth '08, Adela Wik
off '08 and Aura Lee '06, guards.- The
substitutes are Misses Alice Joy '07,
Louise White '07 and Irma Weill '07. \u25a0
SETS HORN'ER'S HOUSE OS FIRE.
OAKLAND, May 6.â An incendiary
set the home of Supervisor F. C.
Homer at Centerville on fire about
midnight last night and but for the,
awakening of the Inmates it would
have been burned to the ground. The
miscreant bored a hole - with a large
auger through the side of the house
and put shavings and paper saturated
with coal oil through the hole and
thenTTÃet it on fire.
Mrs. Homer was awakened by what
she believes to have. been the auger as
it . broke through the wood, but after
listening" and hearing nothing further
trted to sleep. The blase and . the
crackling of the flames soon attracted
her and the licht in the room warned
her of the danger.
The greatest difficulty was experi
enced 1n getting at the fire under the
basement, but it was finally* subdued,
and Homer then got out his auto
mobile and scoured the country, for
It was believed that wheels were heard
driving away about the. time, the fire
was started, but he overtook no one.
The community is greatly exercised
over, the matter : and should the ' man
fall into their hands he is .apt to be
Bummarily dealt v/fth. ' . No cause can
be assigned for the outrage.

S. Colclough, recently from Alaska,
\u25a0poke on "A Prospector's Experience
in the Field."
Macarthur's subject was "The Sea
man â World Pioneer and Citizen." He
eald the supremacy of England was
due to her maritime power. To that
power also was due her military and
political strength. The same applied
to the United States,, whose sailormen
have achieved gallant successes in the
wars In which the country hat been
engaged;
Macarthur took occasion to express
his opinion of Judges sending offend
ers to sea. Such a procedure, he. said,
did not tend to increase the reputation
of the seafaring profession; but would
repel honest, self-respecting men from
seafaring life and would .. . ultimately
leave ships to the mercy of tho crimi
nal class.* â¢ . ;

Golden Gate Park is to have an
other Dutch windmill. The present
mill on the ocean beach has proved
so useful as well as ornamental that
a public spirited citizen has come for
ward with an offer to give $20,000 for
the construction of a similar plant at
the southwest corner of the park.
The proposed new mill may develop
sufficient power to pump â¢ water into
â¢ Stow Lake. In the adornment and
cultivation of Golden Gate Park an
ample water supply is essential. The
quantity of water. 40.000 gallons an
hour, lifted from subterranean
streams near the ocean and ' forced
Into a reservoir a mile distant from
the pumping plant, irrigates quite an
area of the famed pleasure ground
and eaves the city a vast sum -of
money annually.
The announcement of the $20,000
donation was made, at a regular meet
ing of the board In the Palace Hotel
yesterday afternoon. The session was
attended by Commissioners A. B.
Spreckels, President Reuben H.
Lloyd. William H. Metson. W. J. Din
gee, Earl Cummings and Mayor
Bchmltz. Mr. Lloyd was the spokes
man for the donor. He said:
"I am authorized by a man who
does not desire his name to be men
tioned to say that he will give $20,000
toward the building of another wind
mill in the x>ark."
There is an Impression that the lib
eral contributor is Mr. Lloyd himself,
but on this point ha enters vigorous
denial.
At the meeting yesterday the Mayor
congratulated the board on the ex
cellent results accomplished by the
Commissioners in building the present
mill. Incidentally the fact was re
called that the promoters of the enter
prise were roundly censured for
squandering the public money on the
plant. The supply of 'fresh water
seems Inexhaustible and the motive
power for lifting it is given by the
winter and summer winds.
Yesterday President Spreckels,
Commissioner Dingee and Superin
tendent John McLaren were request
ed to call on Charles Webb Howard
and Eec what terms could be made for
Irrigating Lobos square from the
mains of Spring Valley. The board is
improving this park of twelve acres
on North Beach, near Bay. Fillmore
and Webster streets. It Is destined to
become a popular recreation ground.
AUTO3IOBII.E REGULATIONS.
R. P. Schwerin, L. P. Lowe and L
J. Frey, a delegation from the Auto
mobile Club of California, petitioned
the Commissioners to revise the regu
lations touching provileges to auto
mobilists in Golden Gate Park. Mayor
Schmitz joined in the plea for exten
tion of privileges to the owners of
machines.
It was set forth in the agreement to
the board by Mr. Schwerin, president
of the Automobile Club, that the
membership of the club approxi
mated four .hundred. Thy were reput
able, law-abiding citizens and he men
tioned that they should not be Debarred
fronr the use of the thoroughfares in
the park because rowdy renters of ma
chines and Irresponsible chauffeurs dis
regarded the regulations of the board
and endangered the lives of pe
. destrains. He assured the commission
that the members of the .club would
â¢ pay the expense of employing police
men to detect and arrest transgressors.
The club wanted sixty days* time to
demonstrate that the privileges sought
for could be granted with safety to
the public Mr. Schwerin pointed out
that opportunity should be given to
show Eastern visitors the attractions
of San Francisco's great park.
Commissioner Lloyd "said the priv
ileges granted by the board had been
misused. On the south drive the ma
chines at night went at terrific speed
and reckless parties made night hid
eous. The Commissioner remarked that
the park was used by 400,000 people who
did not own automobiles. On Sundays
and holidays it was . crowded with
The profit of the children's play
ground for April amounted to $799 04.
The Japanese tea garden returned a
profit of $127 30 for the same month.
C- P. Wilcomb presented to the Mem
orial Museum an extensive collection
of Civil War relics from the battlefield
of Gettysburg. '
The Bret Harte memorial, "Luck of
Roaring Camp," designed by Robert T.
Aitkin, sculptor, and presented to Gold
en Gate Park by the Bohemian Club,
was accepted on the recommendation of
Douglas Tilden. In the letter recom
mending that the commission accept
the memorial, Mr. Tilden said he
brushed aside technique and judged the
work on its merit. It seems that Com
missioner Carl Cumxnings was con
strained to decline to act as Judge of
the work because he was a competitor
with Mr. Aitken in the general - com
petition which Mr. Phelan invited.
The motion to accept was made by
Commissioner MeUon. â¢ ' â¢>';
It is understood that the Automobile
Club will meet the expense of employ
ing watchers and policemen to enforce
the new regulations. The trUb period
is to. cover sixty days exclusive of Sun
days and holidays, but the south drive
to the ocean will not be closed on any
day. \
BRET HARTE MEMORIAIa
All the good automobiliÃts demanded
to know why they should be punished
because rowdies and harlots and hood
lums made riot at night on the park
thoroughfares. When - Mr. Schwerin
and his associates were asked what
roads they wanted to use they, deslg-r
nated the Panhandle, Warm drive,
South drive and Middle drive. The
Strawberry Hill road and smaller roads
were excluded. A speed limit of eight
miles an hour was acceptable.
It was decided that the superintend
ent should go over the ground next
Wednesday with Mr. Schwerln and
they should agree where signs should
be displayed.
The Commissioners did not accede to
any of the requests of the automobile
delegation, but it was agreed that Mr.
Schwerin should prepare regulations in
accordance with his views and trans
mit them to President Spreckels. Mr.
Lloyd is to prepare regulations to meet
the views of the board. .When'. -this
work is done endeavors will be made
to reach a common ground of agree
ment. ' ' .
women and children. They were en
titled to protection.
Mayor Schmitz urged that the auto
mobillste be given more privileges.- -i,'
The hour of closing the park to auto
mobiles was then taken up for : con
sideration." Presidents Spreckels - sug
gested 8 p. m. as the . closing hour on
the main drive. Mr. Schwerln sug
gested 10 p. m. Mr. Lowe wanted an
open park until midnight. Of ten . he
fancied a trip to the : ocean after 10
p. m., he said.

The deal for the -Graham; group of
mines near Copper City has. been re
corded.' ; The â price of the properties
was $30,000, according to the record.
The Redding Searchlight says about
the deal: ; . .
The 'parties to the agreement are B. A."
Graham. P. F. Grant,- H.'Callaghan,- John D.
Graham and Walter , Basse tt. \u25a0 owners In the
property, and Philip Deideshelmer, . the pres
pectlve purchaser. - Tho Graham group \u25a0Is sit
uated on Horse ' Mountain in the Pittsburg
mining district, about midway , between Copper
City and Balrd. The group Includes the fol
lowing claims: Old Missouri,; Caution, - Cres
cent, Gypsy . Queen, 'l9ol and Copper Belt
Fraction and' a one-half Interest -in the Cop
per Belle,; American and American No. 2. -.".
According to the terms of the agreement
two men must be employed constantly â¢ on \u25a0 the
property by Mr. Deideshelmer after July ; 1,

1900.
There were three locations of 160 - acres
each, covering about six and a half miles â¢of
the Middle Fork, above and below the Cash
Hock mine. ' Tha first, the Lucile placer claim,
takes in the river above * Cash ; Rock, ~ running:
up stream- 12,000 feet and 'being 600, feet wide.
The second, the Francis placer â¢ mine, com
mences at Cash Rock and runs down' stream
12,000 feet from that -, point . and the Marlon
placer - claim, -. of s equal' size, ' joins . it on the
lowerj*s!de, , thus - forming , an < area 600x36.000

liARGE PLACER DEAL^ MADE.
- The most extensive deal mi mining

has, according to: the Placer Re
publican, been made a matter of ; rec
ord. -Placer mining lands extending
along river banks to a distance of six
and a half miles above and below the

by L. F. Trumbull and others. 'The
Republican says regarding the ; trans
action: i * : -
Among the mineral industrial rer
gions ; of the country Florida alohe
has made a show, by its production 'of
phosphate I rock : and : the ; reduction of
the fertilizers for commercial ! use. ; It'
has brought out-phosphate rock"; and
pebble phosphate quite largely. ' Some
of the rock ;- has returned â¢. as higbr-aa
1 S |to 1 6 per, cent | in : phosphoric j acid,
which sells for about S8 40 a ton;" This,
is, equivalent in Rvalue '\u25a0;, to ; what: is ac
counted to be ' very, good gold-bearing
rock. ,\u25a0\u25a0 \u25a0\u25a0 ".- ';\u25a0 % :'\u25a0, ." ;' O'jA

it contains fertilizing material; that can f
beused for, eririchlng'the soil. /U the
rock is as rich" as ia supposed â¢ and' the
deposit is, largeHhe result;of^thia^dis

Survey, the phosphate rock product of
the United ; States amounted. to ;l;67o,-J

was $4,903,912." That is, 'as willy be
seen readily,' the value per. ton ran on
the average as high as many low, grade

Beautiful Miss Marlowe , is as Ophe
lia,, beautiful in her mad scene, beau

case of 1 marring $ personalities." Miss
Marlowe's Ophelia is> too sane, too
normal, in : fact too : healthy a young
woman to have gone madÂ»over any
thing; She has not the fragile, elu
sive charm that " is , Ophelia's chief
characteristic ;,: the 1 flower-like weak
ness, ; the spirit too gentle . for oontact
with the world's harshness. She Is
with ; all Â«.. her humility, a very capable
person, and ? one finds her mad â very
charmingly .and- picturesquely mad- â
with some ; surprise. Everything that
the. Intellect*: can further has been
done,': to a reading most eloquently
lovely. But \ withal it is not \ Ophelia.
Of the 'support, the whole - cast Is
harmonious, -:/ conspicuously excellent
in , the first gravedigger done by Row
land Buckstone, and a Polonlus most
sympathetically played by ; W. h:
Crompton. Norman Hackett is a good
Horatio, Sydney 'C. Mather a spirited

while^th'ere Wai'a 'Heavy-r ainfall- dur

much/ snow "op. the mountains as In
the "previous year. When the'sum
mer, heat began to melt the snow last
year the streams naturally became
higher. â¢ ' -
'-'.\u25a0The 'trout are taking the fly on the
Truckee at the -present time- because
of the cold weather. Later on the
fly fishing will be .bad for^a time when
the heat * begins .' to melt : whatever
snow is on the nearby mountains.. .
The' recent storm is not expected to
interfere with the -fly ; fishing to-mor
row, if the clear weather continues.
The' bait fishing Is" sure to be good.
Last Sunday^ was an off day, as the

life "off the streams. : The rains " since

The concluding half of the eecond
thirty-six hole home-and-home match
fcetween teams representing the Sarti
Francisco Golf and Country Club and
the Claremont Country Club will be
played this afternoon on the course of
ibe former club on the Presidio reser
' ration. The first couple will drive off
fet 2 o'clock.
In the first half of the match, which
svas played en April 22 on the course
of the Claremont Country Club, the
representatives of that club obtained a
itad of fourteen points, only three of
ihÂ» twelve San Francisco players win
ning, their matches and one match be
ing halved. If the Claremont men
should retain an advantage of a single
point at the end of to-day's play, the re-
Fults of both days being reckoned to
srether, the second match of the inter
cjub tournament will be won by them,
ftnd as they were victorious in the first
jnatch. in February, the trophy will
become the property of the Claremont
1 Country Club.
If, however, the San Francisco men,
(â¢laying on their own course, should
prove able to wipe off the fourteen
points against them and to secure an
advantage for themselves the second
match will go to the San Francisco club
and a tie will result, which will be
pl&yed off on some neutral course on a
later day.
A handsome silver cup has been pre
' sented by Gustav Sutro to the ' San
Rafael Golf Club "and will be offered
for competition in a handicap tour
nament at match play. The Qualifying
round over eighteen holes, medal play,
will be held on the course in Happy
Valley on Saturday, the 13th inst. The
match play rounds among those
who qualify will be held on later
date*.
The second handicap tournament
of the California Women Golfers' As
sociation will be held on the Clare
mont Country Club course for the
northern division, and on the links of
the Pasadena Country Club for the
southern division, on Wednesday, the
17th inst.
The schedule of events for the
Women's Annex of the San Francisco
tJolf and Country Club having been
played out, and the year being so far
â¢advanced It is not likely any compe
tition^ for the Chesebrough handicap
trophy will take place until the fall,
\u25a0when the San Francisco Golf and
Country Club will have settled down
in its new quarters and on its new
course near Lake Merced.
The management of the Hotel del
Monte has decided to hold a "golf
week" on the Del Monte links from
Monday, September 4, to Saturday,
September 8, inclusive. Though a
programme has not be*n settled defi
nitely, It Is almost certain It will com
prise a scratch match play competi
tion, preceded by a qualifying round
over thirty-six holes for the Del
Monte cup for men; a handicap
match play competition for the
Del Monte cup for women; a conso
lation event for the men who are
knocked out In the early match play
rounds of the cup competitions .' con
solation event for women, and mixed
foursomes. It was hoped that either
the Pacific Coast Golf Association or
the California Women Golfers' Asso
ciation, or both these organizations,
might have held events during "golf
week," but neither association is in a
position to do so this year.
The Pacific Northwest Golf Associa
tion will forego its regular annual
tournament, which was to have been
held at Seattle, and in its stead will
hold a Lewis and Clark golf tourna
ment on the links of the Waverly Golf
Club at Portland. As June is the la
test month in which the links remain
In first-class condition, the tournament
will be played in the week beginning
June 18. The principal events will be
the competitions for the champion
ships of the Pacific Coafct for men
and for women. These competitions
will be open to all amateu**s, entries
closing on June 14. Entrkj, accom
panied by the entrance fee of $5,
should be sent to T. A. Linthicum,
aecretary of the Waverly Golf Club.
Several other contests mill be arranged
so as to provide a pleasant week for
golfers who do not succeed in reaching
the later rounds of the championship
â¢vents.
The arrlvalof the trade winds will
undoubtedly lessen the "attendance on
the tennis courts" and those who can.
I will do their practicing in the nefgh-" .
'< boring counties. May, June and July
are the poorest months In the year.for t
tennis la San Francisco. The morn
ings are ideal, but few of the players,
can get out before 3 or 4 o'clock- At
that time the wind is usually top
strong: to make playing much t of a
pleasure- The absence of many of the
players from the city will also lessen
tne attendance. During the next three
months . most of the play ins will be
done late in the afternoon, â¢ when the.
wind dies down. . \u25a0 . .
The ; first championship tournament
of. the year will be played this month .
and the cracks are all practicing: hard
for it. The announcement by" Cham
pion Percy ' Murdock that he will de
fend his title to the San Francisco
championship adds considerably to the
interest in the event. If the cham-'
pion is In any kind of condition he
should be successful in defending his
title.- The only man" who will" have
a chance to beat him is George Baker'
and he will have to be at his best if
he hopes to win. The other candidates
are mostly young players who hardly
figure ' in the championship class at
present.
No tournaments are scheduled for to-"
day or ' to-morrow, but it Is expected
an Impromptu tourney win be held on
the park courts to-morrow.' The cracks
at the public courts figure a scratch
singles would do- them more good than
just practice matches. This event
would bring together the best players
at â¢ the park and most of the promi
nent entries in the San Francisco
championship tournament. Those who
will probably compete are* the Baker
brothers. C. Foley, C. Dunlap, C. Grif
fin. F. Adams. G. Lytton, E. Flnnegan
and several others.
A handicap doubles tournament for |
the Directors' cups will be held on the
California Club courts on the 14th.
These trophies have been competed for
but once and are in the possession of
Herbert Schmidt and Harry .Rplfe.
On the 13th the annual singles tour
nament I for the championship of : the i
Academic Athletic League will be
played. The doubles which were played
last Saturday resulted in a victory for
the Long brothers of Lowell High
School. - Herbert Long will represent
that . school : In the singles and many \u0084
expect to see him carry off the honors.
The "only .man who has a chance .to..
beat Long Is . Charles Foley ]of ,Pdly_-y,'
technic.p Foley is fully as clever "as *
Long and when they meet the beat
match in the history 'of Academic.
League tennis should result. Herbert
Schmidt won the singles championship
for Boone's University School last year.
This event. will be played on the Cali
fornia Club courts In the morning.
-The handicap singles :' tournament
played by the members of the Ladies'
Annex on the park courts during the
week was by far the . most interesting
held since the reorganization of the
club. The tournament was remarkable
for. the number of long deuce seta'
played. , The young ladies, will meet
in a handicap doubles tournament two
weeks from to-day.
A 1133. Hazel Hotchkiss. .the clever
young player from Berkeley, left -for
Scotland last Saturday. She will com
pete in the English championship tour
nament in July. . .
MiAs May Button, national champion,
will also be a candidate for champion
ship honors in England. Miss , Sutton .
so completely outclassed every woman
player in , the United States last year
that the Southern : California enthusi
asts are determined she shall have a
try at > the world's championship 'this â¢
year.' \u25a0It would be bard to convince
any one who has seen Miss . Sutton
play that there, is a woman In the
world who can beat her.

the. men weigh in. Britt was the first
to appear and was cheered as he made
his ' way to the appointed place. .
White was soon on the scene and
no time was lost 'settling 'down' to": the

the bun* and after Referee Eddie

Californian stepped on. The bar trem
bled.for. an Instant, but did not rise.
White was ready, by this time and 'he
stepped up for the test. White proved
to be of almost the Identical weight as

There was the usual exchange of

A speech was demanded of Mitchell
as he led the way out with his little

When the two boxers stripped in
the ring Britt seemed much the larg
er all over, especially about the. body.
White had remarkable muscular de
velopment about the shoulders, but he
seemed deficient. about the body. This
deficiency did} not seem to affect his
fighting, as he showed wonderful vi
tality during the fight. .His legs are
particularly shapely, being more of
the type seen in sprinters than in > men
who follow the fortunes of the* ring
for a livelihood. Early in the fight
White's footwork seemed defective, as
he seemed to stand flatfooted. v/hich
made him slow to get into action.
This defect apparently wore off as the
fight advanced and did not seem to
hurt his style. " â¢ .
Britt was outfeinting White in: the
opening rounds, but in the third White
measured him with the eye of the
clever boxer, and sent a right to the
body which surprised the spectators.
There was a buzz of comment around
the ringside, the opinion being that
White had a lot of tricks up his sleeve
which would puzzle Britt. He tried
this same blow a number of times, but
could not do any execution with it.
Both men did a lot of swinging, the
blows going wide. of their mark.
BRITT IS TOO EAGER.
Britt especially was ; an off ender in
this regard, his eagerness to land up
setting his judgment of distance com*
pletely. White worked the famous
shift a number of times and also tried
a double shift, which proved effective.
From the sixth round to the tenth
! Britt seemed intent on bringing the
; victory before the tenth round. At the
end of\the sixth both were slugging
wildly when the bell rang, which they
did not heed, and the referee had to
send them to their corners.
The first blow that Britt landed and
which seemed to^affect White was a
right over the heart which was deliv
ered near the end of the seventh round.
Brltt followed this with a left to the
body and White hung out signals - of>
distress as he went to his corner. White
could not keep Britt away from him in
the eighth round, the Californian being
all over him. In this round he started
White's mouth and nose bleeding.
Early in the round^ Britt seemed to
have lost his head completely, he was
so wild in his fighting.
. It was in the ninth round that Britt
tried his new righthand punch for the
first time. He caught ' White on j the
head, but did no material damage.
White sent one of his clean rights to
the head in the tenth round. This
shook Britt up, but it only had the ef
fect of making him fight all the faster.
White apparently thought to worry
Britt by peppering him on the sore
eye, but he soon gave this up. as in his
efforts to land there he left himself
open to the attacks of the Californian.
In the seventeenth round White
claimed a foul, which was not allowed.
Britt had tried for a body blow and
White in blocking it sent it below the
waist line. Britt had White dazed in
this round and for a time It seemed
he would win there. He caught White
a hard left on the head and followed
this up with a shower of blows to the
head and body.
White was tired In the eighteenth
round and did not recover during the
remainder of the struggle. ' Britt was
the aggressor throughout the . last
round and fdrced White all over the
ring until he finally .landed the blow
which gave him the greatest .fight in
his ring career. â¢' '\u25a0'-'/(', ". r
The spectators were astonished at the
pace set by the men during the first
five rcunds and were- more "astonished
as the fight progressed to find that
they slowed down but little. It seemed
that mere flesh and blood could not
stand the strain, but the two boxers
came out of It in a condition- which
showed that they: had been trained to
perfection.
Jimmy Britt stopped Jabez White,
the English champion boxer, in Wood
ward's Pavilion last night in onÂ« of the
fastett and greatest ring: battles ever
fought in the history of the Queens
berry ring. The end came unexpected
ly when but twenty seconds remained
of the last round of the scheduled
twenty it was to go.
Britt had tried several times during
the progress of the fight to land a new
blow which he has developed, a right;
swing from the level of the shoulder. ,
It had not proved effective up to this |
lime, but for once it caught White on
the point of the jaw. The blow dazed
the English champion and turned him
partly around. This left his body a
target for Britt, who caught him atter
rible blow in the pit of the stomach.
Britt, who had been lighting through
out the round like an enraged tiger,
followed up his advantage and White
went down heavily on his back. He ;
was down fully six seconds. While his
strength was ebbing away his fighting
spirit was still strong. His scattered
thoughts were collected slowly and he ;
struggled to his feet, game to the end.
Britt rushed at his staggering oppo
nent and rained blow after blow on his
head. "When it seemed he could retain
consciousness but little longer Referee
3niith humanely stepped between the '
boxers and ended the unequal contest.
Under the rules of the prizering Britt
will be credited with a knockout in his
record.
The crowd, which had apparently
sympathized with White throughout
the contest, gave Britt all of the honors
due a champion. The cheering con
tinued for some time, until Britt
stepped to the middle of the ring and
put up his hands, asking for an op
portunity to be heard. When silence
was secured he said:
"Gentlemen, don't cheer for me, but
give three cheers for Jabez Wnite. I
take off my hat to him, for he is the
gamest man- I ever met."
White won the hearts of the spec
tators by coming forward in manly
style and saying: "Britt is a better
man than 1 am. The best man won
to-night." He then drank the health
of the crowd from a small flask from
which Mitchell had given him small
drinks during the progress of the fight.
WHITE A CIiEVER BOXER.
The fight was between a great fight
er, who also proved a clever boxer,
and one who is possibly the cleverest
boxer In the ring to-day. WTiite was
pronounced by many of the spectators
a "cleverer boxer than Gans, and fully
as clever a ring general, but he lacks
the terrible punishing power of the
man from Baltimore.
Up. to the twelfth round there was
little to choose between the two men.
White blocked many of Britt's blows
and was landing frequently on the Cal
ifornian. He proved a great Judge of
time and distance and landed many
hard blows in the tenth round. He cut"
Britt's left eye badly and kept it bleed
ing for the remainder of the fight.
White commenced to lose his effective
ness in the thirteenth round, being
punished severely about the body by
that time. Britt ehowed slight supe
riority up to the seventeenth round,
and from that time on his tremendous
vitality carried him along at a pace
which White could not withstand.
Britt seemed overanxious almost
from the tirie proceedings started, and
he tried all he knew. His favorite mode
of attack was a left to the body, which
he seemed to bring up to the head with
almost the same movement White
blocked many of the body blows, but
still enough went through his guard to
hurt him. He knew all the tricks of the
boxer's art and drew Britt's fire re
peatedly and then sent in hard blows
in return. Britt used his right on but
two or three occasions, and it was
readily seen that had he as good a
right as White no boxer in the -world
would have a license to step Into the
ring with him. White showed one pe
culiar blow, a snake-like left, which
fooled Britt repeatedly and caught him
flush in the face. The power was not
there to stop the rushes of the Califor
nian.
BRINGS BABY'S SHOE. \u25a0
A sentimental incident of the fight
developed shortly after White en
tered the ring. He had brought with
him a tiny red shoe, which he fastened
with tender care on the roue in his
corner. This was the shoe of his baby
girl in far-away England and he ap
parently hoped with the superstition
of the fighter that It would bring him
luck In the struggle in which he waa
about to engage.
Although the fighting throughout
the twenty, rounds was of- the most
desperate character, neither , boxer
was badly punished,' while the only
times when either was on the floor
was when Britt slipped down in the
twelfth round and White was knocked
down In the twentieth. Britt over
balanced himself in ducking one of
White's blows and fell over on his
back. He barely touched the floor be
fore he was on his feet again and
fighting faster than ever.
..'A. regrettable incident . of the fight,
was the mean spirit shown by- the
crowd toward Britt throughout the
entire' battle. Some of the spectators
cheered for White throughout, going
out of their way to honor the visitor
at the expense of the home boy,. who
was entitled to all credit for' the
manly fight he was making.*|gflBPMg
Britt was the first to enter the ring-
He was accompanied by Spider Kelly,
Sam Berger, Tiv Krelirig and. Frank
RafaeL White was some, minutes late
and finally came in, accompanied by
Charley. Mitchell, Charley Mitchell Jr.,
Jimmy Lawler and James Murphy; of
England. Billy Jordan introduced.
White as the lightweight champion of
England and Britt as the lightweight
champion of America."
Eddie Hanlonand Young " Corbett
were presented to the specators, \ the
former being Introduced . as "the little
favorite of , San Francisco." 7 He was
called upon for a speech and - made a

blocking vicious swings was again in evidence
and the crowd wÂ»f much pleased. Brltt swung
left thrice for the Jaw. but was blocked, and
\u0084-v s efforts *t a counter were also blocked.
White was â¢ bleeding slightly from the mouth
as he took his seat and Brltfs eye looked very
bad. indeed. .Brltt's blows on the body were
the only ones that seemed to puzzle White.
Brltt at once. shot his left to the" stomach.
They sparred and White sent Brttt to thfÂ» *
floor, with a straight right to the face. Brltt"
waa off his balance, however, as the blow,
landed and the ; delivery waa nor very clean.-
Brltt was up . naickly . and fought -as though
noth.ng had happened. He realized very soon '
that he was In a. fight, for White clouted him

but the Englishman took his punishment *
without wincing. Brltt appeared to have lmÂ»t*
proved In his speed and White found it harder j*
to block - the onslaughts.
Round Fifteen.
Brltt missed left for the body twice and two â¢
left attempts for the Jaw were blocked. Britt ;
continued to do all the leading. White still
contenting- himself with defensive work. Brltt,.
missed left for the body and then, crossed vMlli I
left : to White's face and then uppercut with '
left to the body. They mixed It continually ;
and Brltt planted a short arm left to White's
Jaw and blocked all attempts of the English
man to counter. Brltt tJ>en worked his left to
the body. and hooked left to the Jaw. Brltt '
waa landing' with monotonous regularity, but
his blows 'did not seem to feaze the English- \u25a0â¢

lefts to the Jaw and quick as a Sash drove a
straight left to. the body and the Englishman
covered. Brltt swung his left to the face, then
blocked White's counters. Britt ' shot his left
to the body, then sent a stiff left to the Jaw.
They went to a clinch. Britt kept forcing th*
pace. ; White merely acting on the defensive.
Britt again hooked hU left to the stomach anil
the bell rang with alt the honors In the Cali
fornian's favor. At this stage Britt appeared
to- hold a long lead and had the decision won
easily - unless .White should" make a brace. ,
Britt did the leading and landed the cleaner \u25a0
blows. â¢
Round Seventeen.
The usual opening clinch followed. Brltt
missed twice for . the - face ' and head and at
tempts vby both with right and left swing*
went wild. Britt finally, shot two . left - swlnjo
to face and. they went -to a. clinch.
Breaking away Brltt shot his left out rather
low and there was some hissing from the gal
lery. \u25a0 Brttt "hooked his unerring left to th*
body and then. varied it with, a right to thÂ»
head. White fought back rather feebly and
appeared ." to have lost ' all his steam. \u25a0 . Brltt

also barren : and then Brltt rocked White's
head ' with a full - right twin? to ths \u25a0 chin.
Brltt mUsed a fearful . left swing - and a .right
swing partly caught the Britisher on the face.
White kept Brttt busy leading blocking most
of the' Calif ornian's attempts. One left reached
the - Englishman's chin lightly.- then . Whit*

THERE is complete freedom of the press in France. . If proof of
this were wanted it is found in the French Review of Reviews.
The editor discusses the relations of the French republic and
the Russian autocracy with a freedom that must be painful to both
governments. â¢
France has been the recruiting ground for Russian finances.
The Trench are a thrifty people. They went Jnto their stocking
hoard for the money to pay the German/ indemnity^ at the close.bf
the Franco- Prussian war. They sustained the loss of 1,000,000,000
francs in. the Panama canal failure and hardly murmured. They
Have now financed Russia, not only by taking her bonds, but by all
.sorts of commercial loans and bonds. The people, in" other words,
have with their money loyally supported their Government in' the
Russian alliance. What may follow all this^ lavish, contribution; of
their substance is ppenly discussed by the French Review of Re
views.
The editor declares that the loans; made to -Russia far exceed;
any financial risk ever before undertaken by lthe French people:; "He
predicts a fall in Russian bonds that : will be a national catastropHe : to;
France. The most serious result of this will be af political? reaction,
restoring the influence of the Clerical party, and probably leading
to the overthrow of the republic â¢ . â¢ ". "
Hisr'views are not expressed in the language of an alarmist, but
seem to be a calm analysis of known facts, with justifiable specula-]
tion as to results. He lectures the French Government, /declaring
that under present conditions it has only one duty to perform in Uhe
interest of self-preservation. "It must:offer- to Russia a; large loan
which will enable her; to pay the indemnity demanded by^ Japan, but
only on condition that a -constitution '.is "'granted., th'ej Russian^people;
that they may control their own -finances." â¢ Should the ; Czari refuse, 1
it will be necessary to leave him to : his fate, but' he should be; forcedl
to, make a solemn declaration' that the . French nation : has done every
thing-ih its power to* save our invested billions and Russia in the
bargain. If he have not the moral- courage** to do so, then ;let /him!
not afterward cornplain^of the fate which will overtake him "when he
has ruined the people and^driven them to 'acts of idespair.'/ '
Ih r Europe it is believed -that /this "remarkable /publication =\u25a0 ;was
inspired -by the^^ French Government as^ a .''feeler";of public/senti
ment in ; France and Russia. Supplementirig this is the '\u25a0- opinion *
that Pyama's inactivity and Rojest^
sea; with his fleet imply that secret negotiation^ are; pending.; b'e^
tween tHe two nations looking to peace. Russia would Jna^njeasjure
save her face by a compromise^ which ',would^e ;calle^ aytie, tHe
actual of the sea; being- left in doubt, y .: >'~ \u25a0
There can be no doubt that the serious financial risk- of
with* appalling: political consequences in sigHt, . malce! itStb (the in
terest of that Government to promote peace.~~~ It i is \u25a0 probable that the
conferences between King . Edward and \u25a0 President Ldubet'; have \ more
to do with this subject than with the" teapot tempest raised by the

THE extensive sj'Stem of suburban roads in Alameda County
has proved such a profitable convenience to the trade of Oak
land that the' use of such ready transportation is being con
sidered throughout Northern; California. The isolation of Lake
Countj' will soon be ended" by means of electric roads, and they,
are being projected on both sides of the Sacramento Valley. The
abundance of hydraulic power in tjie mountain streams can create
any needed quantity of electric energy in* the Sacramento and San
IJoaquin valleys for use in transportation, and electric road projects
are numerous. The towns of Marysville, Colusa and TeHama and
every prominent point in the Sacramento Valley will be connected
by that means, as will be the San Joaquin Valley centers.
Already an electric road is under construction to terminate,
near the Yosemite Valley along the line of the Merced River. This
line will furnish transportation, to a valuable mining country in
Mariposa County, and will shorten the trip to the Yosemite. An
other line is planned to Wawona, with Fresno as its valley terminus.
When these roads are in action there will be left on the t Yosemite
.route only the stage road of tyenty-six miles from Wawona to the
valley, and travel will ; go in by one electric road and out by the
other, taking in the .-Mariposa Big Trees and all of the mountain
scenery.' These facilities will greatly increase the Yosemite travel,
and will remove all the present hardship from the journey./.
It will soon be possible to take an electric car to any point in
Northern California that is not already served by a steam road.
At the railroad station, instead of the stage coach, an electric car will
be waiting for passengers and mail for interior points. These roads
will facilitate the settlement of the country, will promote the break
ing up of large estates into small holdings and will advance the
interest^of^the steam roads by serving as feeders. The fruit grow
ers intend to use them for transportation to the; canneries and to
, shipping points. It is proposed to connect the fruit-growing districts
>-of Placer County in this way by a line that will ultimately penetrate
Nevada^ounty, and bring together communities that now commu
nicate in a very roundabout and inconvenient way.
The country press everywhere appreciates the importance of
these projects. There are Tjaturally rich regions all over the State
that can never- hope for steam railroad facilities.' The teaming cost
hampers their development. People who 'come from the: Eastern
States, where the average wagon haul to a railroad station is only
from three to five miles, are discouraged when they are asked to
look at land lying from fifteen to forty miles from- a depot. But
when such land has direct connection by electric roads it will come
into market and will be speedily settled. The whole economics, of
are to be changed for the better by electricity. Where
other parties will not build electric lines the steam railroads will
find it to their advantage to build their own electric feeders.
In the East electric power generated by steam costs more than
Lit docs here generated by water power. Yet* the East is gridironed
by suburban electric roads. They run on long routes, and in many
cases carry sleeping cars for all night travel. Whether competing
.with steam roads or merely feeding them, they seem to pay, for
construction is extended every year. Their business in light freight
ing is increasing, and they are an indispensable part of the country's
distributing system.
In California there is great need of . speedy access to steam
transportation for such perishable property as. fruit. *Tt is not im
proved by a long wagon haul and will be saved much deterioration
v^by electric transportation. Such a facility will enable the country,
producer to . appreciate how close together the world has been
by rapid transit. The international parcels post has just
-been put into operation between the United States and England.
The first parcels recently arrived in San Francisco only twelve days
/from Liverpool. Our fresh fruit already has a market in London.
When the electric cars will carry it quickly to a shipping point and
when the overland roads will speed their freight schedule so that
it can reach Liverpool in twelve days, there are seasons of the year
in which that distant market will look to us for a large supply, and
by the use of electric and steam roads here we can meet the
demand. i
The steam roads have never t had much faithun the outshipmerit
of fresh fruit, and their policy has not encouraged it. One reason
alleged is the slowness in collecting carloads and^train loads of fruit
at Shipping points. Cars have to lie id!e too long waiting for fruit
to come by wagon haul. If this is a valid objection, the electric
roads promise to obsolete it. Where they/run through an orchard
district the electric cars can stop anywhere td'take on fruit, and can
deliver it promptly for shipment. The people of California should
give every encouragement to the / development of this means of local
transportation which seems to promise so much.

Song to Sleep bb 3 ' Coffee.
"The fearful work coffee has done for
me Is difficult to describe.
"I had ao idea how weakened one
can become from the breaking down ef-
fect of: coffee on the nerves.
"When that has gone^on long enough
most anything may set in. I had three
attacks of pneumonia , and became a
chronic invalid. I had no idea that cof-
fee hud put me in my deplorable con-
dition. Well, I finally went to Colorado"
on advice, and found a nice place to
board with a family. The man of the
house had just returned from" a sojourn
In California, whither he had gone for
heart trouble, but the doctor out- there
discovered that . his weak . heart was
caused by coffee, took it away and
gave him Postum. His Â» trouble was \
quickly dismissed and he came home a
well man. He suggested that probably
it was coffee 'affected me. I laughed
him to scorn; nevertheless I began gin-
gerly on Postum, and found it so rich
and with a nice coffee snap that I liked
It immensely.
"From the beginning the Postum Cof-
fee had a beneficial effect on me. I Im-
proved In . every way, my sleep came
back, healthy and refreshing, and in a
few/weeks I went home a well woman,
as I am to this day. I still use Postum,
of course, and will never return "to the
old kind. :^Bg3V3PQSÂ£BS
'â¢Noting the good effects of Postum In
my case, I wrote home urging that It
be given to ay 12-year-old , daughter,
who was \-ery delicate ; and frequently
ill from a complication of diseases con-
nected with the liver. Well;; my people
tried it, but were disgusted with itâ
they didn't make It right. They said it
was lmDossible: for; them i to -drink it,
and my daughter rebelled and cried for
the old kind of coffee. 'When I : came
home I changed all that by making it
rightâ allowing -it to %. boll for twenty
minutes after It first came; to* a boil,
and served It with cream., The ; child

day next.
P. Ryan will visit New Tork again,
but leaves Honiton here to recuperate.
After a highly successful season Dick
Dwyer leaves to-day for Louisville,
Ky., where he will do the starting.
Dick is popular with all. and his splen
did record speaks for itself.
Interlude was plunged on to win the
second event, the odds dropping from
4 to 2. The gelding ran well to within
thirty yards of the wire.
Already rumors are floating around
that the season will open earlier than
usual next fall.
TRACK NOTES.
King did better, though, with Hugh
McGowan, favorite for the mile and
seventy yard event followiner. The
gelding looked to have a slisrht edee
on his field and. ridden out. downed
Cotillion a length. The show went to
Sincerity. Belle.
Old Whisky King, after beine tipped
and touted about for two weeks, made
Rood in the concluding seven furlonc
purse run. Fifteen to one was oosted
by the layers, but few climbed aboard
at that price. Jimmy Bozeman soon
in front with the veteran cam
paigner and, in a drivinjr finish, led
Sen Mark past the judges lees -than a
length. Ed Lilburn, the post favorite,
retired after being prominent for a
time.
Billy Engstrom's filly, Jerusha. had
first call in the betting on the mile and
a sixteenth selling run. If she can run
over a fast track, then Lloyd Fountain
must be a much slower rider than O.
Chandler. Dr. Rowell's Mistress of
Rolls f hould have scored without effort.
King, however, got his dates badly
mixed in the run home and Lily Gold-
Ing, a 15 to 1 shot, beat the Rowell
entry half a length. Glendene was
third.
Lamasney Bros.. after chasine
Christine A after gome of the unDer
ten on different occasions in the Dast.
dropped the mare into the mile and a
furlong selling fixture. It proved a soft
spot. for. at odds of 9 to 5. McÃride
brought her in an easy first, two
lengths before Firm Foot. The show
went to Marelio.
. Ltttle Earnshaw covered himself
with glory by landing Pickaway, a 10
tÂ» 1 shot, winner of the flve-furlong
dash, with the weights raised ten
pounds above the scale. The outsider
riced Interlude to a standstill and
then earned the verdict in a three-head
finish with Lurene and Toto Gratlot-
BÂ«ll Reed, the favorite, ran a wretched
race.
Southern Lady, with Graham in the
paddle, closed favorite for the two
year-old scramble, at four furlongs.
.The young apprentice rode a clever
race on the filly, and passing Commo
dore Eastland in the stretch won-hand

â¢hands a 3 to 2 favorite, and at no stage
looked a winner. Johnny Schorr's Ana
nias, carrying 112 pounds, ridden by
Knapp and 5 to 1 in the ring, led from
\u2666the start, and in a driving finish dis
posed of Gold Enamel by a neck. High
Chancellor made a frightful showing.
The ring presented an animated ap
pearance and ' the layers could handle
as much coin as they desired. But
three favorites arrived on schedule
time.
Honiton closed her engagement at

and a half furlong handicap yesterday.

[ and j disgust; are) expressed by the ath- J
letes >of i the Y university, and particu
! larly the boating crew, over . the re- i
Pjorts printed in; the newspapers of |
Washington, that purport to come from
the iUniversl'y of Washington boating
men regardirr:; their treatment while
&tl the University of California.
. The ' northerners : declare " that ".iey
were; treated like Princes *< by V the Stan
ford men, being entertained at the Pal
ace "Hotel, \ and ; in other^ways made to
feel :' that i."nothing was -too good for
them." - : "-'"uf our treatment"by the Uni
1 versity of California ., men," say ' the
University; of Washington crew, "we
prefer not to speak, except in private."
: The California men are going north
on i May 15 to row again with the
Washington men in northern waters,
and they propose then to call the men
of .Washington .; to account for what
Ahey. declare . are unbecoming, unfair
and untrue, declarations, reflecting upon
their characters as ' hosts and sports
men..' . . -t , '
/The Washington men were defeated
by California, but sincef .their return
they have â¢ assured the home J folk that
they could . have â¢ won but for the fact
that they- rowed on a course with which
California was familiar^ and they were
not.
"The fact is," said Edwin J. Loeb,
coxswain of " the California . boating
crew," "that the Washington crew was
given the most advantageous part of
the course by u& "after we had- won
the toss and had the right to choose the
best , for â¢ ourselves. The course where
we , rowed was miles from the part
of the estuary, where we practiced as a
crew. \ Incidentally when the Wash
ington crew broke their oar, at a time
when we were a; length in the lead, we
stopred the race, \u25a0 gave them an oar
and . refused to accept victory until
fairly and thoroughly won.
\u25a0â¢.\u25a0*â¢ "Regarding" hospitality, we enter
tained -the Washington men at the
fraternity houses, settled bills present
ed for their; entertainment J and treated
them: like Princes. It is true : no. dances
or social ; functions were 'arranged for
them, I ', as might have been ; done In a.
smaller, university or a college, . for
California University is a busy place,
but the Washington fellows got: the
best we ; had iwithin the bounds that
California men . are obliged ;to set for
themselves in athletic affairs."
-Coach Christie, who is very indig
nant at the charges made by the Wash
ingtonians, will accompany the men on
the trip north and he .. will see that an
accounting is rendered by \ the Wash
ington ". athletes." The men,*, incidental
ly, propose to prove that they can du
plicate their' easy victory over Wash
ington when they / row" on the. Wash
ington crew's courser and this feeling
Is .expected to. lend additional zest to
a contest thafwas- sure to be keen and
closely fought under, -." any

The cruiser Chicago, new flag
ship of the Pacific squadron, will prob
ably be at anchor In man-of-war row,
off Folsom street, within a few days.
Early Thursday morning the Chicago,
with the Concord. Paul Jones and
Saturn, the latter a navy collier, left
Monterey for Santa Cruz, where the
little fleet will spend a few days be
fore coming on to this port. At Mon
terey the Chicago attracted a great
deal of interest and was thronged with
visitors "every day during her stay
there. A lively gale swept Monterey
Bay on Wednesday and the torpedor
boat destroyer Paul Jones nearly got
into difficulties. Two anchors proved
insufficient to tiold'her and with great
difficulty .she \u25a0was taken , alongside the
moorings ' and there made fast until
the gale had spent itself. â

WXW YORK. May s.â The stock market
was free to-day from the pressure of urgent
liquidation wfeich broke yesterday's market and
recovered rigorously something more than the
loeees of the day before. \u25a0 There wsa a decided
thrink&ge in the volume of business, showing
tfc-t the bidding np of prices had to be carried
furxher to recover a leaa amount of stocks
than was sold yesterday. This constitutes an
â¢Koellent ehowing of the reduced \-olume of
etock offering for sale and is an indication of
technical strength and relief afforded by the
liquidation so far completed, but there was a
v*ry marked failing off in the demand at the
higher level of prteee, the dullness of -the
trading showing a progressive Sncreaae. The
inference Is that the buying was to a large
extent forced in the same way that yester-
Jar's selling was. The bear traders who fol
lowed the decline yesterday with free short
â¢ales felt obliged to cover their short con
tract* In the face of the .evidence that the
xaoÂ« urgent liquidation wu completed Some
of the fears caused yesterday by the signs of
â¢weakness in the market or which were given
currency by the Industry of the beam lost
their force to-day, and the relief thus afforded
helped on the rally. There was no important
change in the news bearing on \-aluÂ«a, but
there was a decided change In the temper
â¢hown .in its Interpretation. The attitude
towards Reading, affords aa illustration The
stock waa sold on account of the news of the
distribution of a part of Lake Shore's treasury
holdings, as thle was supposed to be a well
Informed view that the .price had advanced
unwarrantedly. To-day it was urged â¢ that the
fact that this considerable supply had been
marketed without preventing the great â¢ rise
in the *tock wm evidence of the" absorptive
power of the market for it and Its intrinsic
Â«r<srrth. Ywsterdey*e fears of \u25a0a - conflict -at
tlte' Union Pacific special stockholders' meet
ing over the proposed Issue of $100,000,000 of
preferred stock were converted to-day into
professed hopes of some extraction at that
meeting of special benefit to stockholders. The
street vac without new 8 from the : meeting ud
to the close of the market. The Northwestern
and Pacific stocks, however .were the aggress
ive leaders of the rebound in prices, as they
.had been mort acutely affected by the preceding
drop. The Southern group was also notably
strong, as they also had euffered more than
the average, from the violence of the reaction
from the excesslv* Â«pecul*tlve advance. Con
solidated Gas had the benefit of the failure
Of < tne \u25a0***Â»?Â» t0 PÂ«*s a law reducing th*
price of gas in thia city. The effect of the
weakness here yesterday had an nnaÂ»ttllnr
influence In to-day, early fore!KTmarkÂ«"and
came action eeemed to be given there' also to
the fears of international friction. The forelim
depression was of only Blight , effect on our
opening market and the recovery Â«Â«*. "in
promptly. The estlmateg of th* week^T cuÂ£
rency movement indicated a nominal *am in
each by the banks. The upwart Â£Â»h 0? Pe Â£
pie c Gas at the Â«nd was due to the rÂ«port of
the defeat of a gas bill to the > HllnolsTLeila
lature. The sharp reaction during the fins?
hour and the recovery to the firm closmV
were notable- for the exceedingly light .deal*

Cotton and Copper.
The Bastera wire* of B. F. Hutton & Cix
resterC&r Â«ald:
COTTON â Ltk* nearly every one else In thÂ»
cotton trade, wÂ« were surprised by the sharp
advances in prices to seven poinu of futurea
a.t Liverpool this morning and by the heavy
baying movement which also converged on our
market. This na,turally caught the shorts un
protected and Induced the compulsory covering
of this Interest competing with the heavy
buying Â«f dull Interests. We still regard the
market as more or less a waiting one, pending
further developments calculated to give the
trade a more definite Ides, regarding the ex
tent of reduction In the acreage. On account
of the season being three to four week late we
do rot think this can be obtained until three
to four weeks from now.
A eorresposdent at Ttexarkaaa ssjrs: "We
are getting accounts of tsrrlSo. ratine from every
quarter. Delay la planting la already serious.
But now matters are in bad shape here. No
recollection of such backwardness. Land badly
washed and will bÂ« no field work for at least
t week, even should the rains stop bow. We
consider conditions very serious In this sec
tion."
COPPER â Boston market showed an encour
aging rally all through the session. There
was no great demaad for stocks, bat the celling
seemed to have practically stopped and the
floor trader* took advantage of It to bid up
prices all through the list, so that the dose is
considerably higher than yesterday. We think
that any stock sold on a further rally can be
bought back cheaper. The baying of Amai
garnated Copper was considered good and the
ontlook for a farther rise to-morrow Is ex
cellent. â¢,; <*:â¢
European Gold Movement.
â¢ The New York Commercial | and Financial
Chronicle's London advices pay:
"All the gold offering In the open market
continues to be bought op on F"rench account.
Rates of Interest and discount hÂ»nÂ» (London)
ere now so low that the French banks do not
cere to leave all the balances they have been
employing here so long. Consequently, they
have not been renewing all the bills aa they
fell due, and the result is that all the gold
offering in the open market hat been bought
up for Paris. Moreover, subscriptions to the
nÂ«Tv Central Mining and Investment Corpors.
ticn have led to considerable amounta being re
mitted try Pari.9. which doubtless has added -to
the buying of gold. And it is believed also
that the RuFSian Government 16 drawing upon
its balances, both In London and in Paris, and
that the French banks in consequence have
to buy up gold for Paris toj meet this demand.
It looks, therefore, aa if gold would continue
to go to Paris for some time longer, and in the
opinion of the best judges there will before
long be a riff In rates of Interest and discount
here. If there Is not gold' will certainly be
taken both by France and Erypt, and that
would bring about a rise after a while."
Oregon Crop Bulletin*,
T*e report of Edward A- Beals. section di
rector, IT.BiU4 Slates Weather Bureau, for the
Oregon Crop Bulletin, week ended May 2, is as
follows:
The weather during the week - was too cool
for rapid growth sjid crops x>n th* whole did
not advance so rapidly aa during the preceding
week. There were several sharp frosts, the
most damaging of which occurred Wednesday
morning, at -which time tender vegetables and
seme varieties of fruit were injured.
Plowing and seeding are now practlcalry
completed and work oa summer fallow la pro-
Freesing nicelt Tall and spring grain con
tinue In excellent condition. Wheat oats rye
and barley are growing satisfactorily, and In
some sections of Western Oregon rye and bar
lfy are beginning to head. Hops have reached
the tops of the wires in come farored locali
ties, but in many yards the crop is coming up
unevenly, necessitating the "cutting back" of
the vines.
Corn and potato planting continue*. Some
corn is up and the stand is reported as very
rood. Early potatoes were quite badly frosted
during the week, the tops in many localities
being frotea to the ground. Gardens have
made clow growth owing to the lack of eun
ehlne. Meadows and pastures are in fine con
dition and stock looks well. Lambing Is about
over. Sheep and goat shearing continues, with
clip generally above average. All tree fruit.
except Ute apples, more or less injured by
frost, but report* as to the extent continue
very conflicting. Peaches, prunes and cherries
however, have suffered most. Bush fruit and
strawberries promise good yields.

only once." V
When it was explained to -him that
under the law an unlimited number of
arrests can be made for the same
drunk he hinted that the law stood in
need. of repair. "
"However," said the court, "I am in-
I clihed to accede to your proposal, de
| spite the crookedness of your logic
The police say you were not a trouble-
I some prisoner and that fact amelior
! ates to some extent your impudent
bringing of a jag across the bay."
I "I didn't,"- was the prompt, response.
("Every drink I took was bought and
| paid for in this city."
Then he told how. it came/ to pass.
For half a year he had warked stead
ily and shunned the cup that intoxi
cates, and when the combination of in
dustry and total abstinence \u25a0 began to
j pall he had saved enough: money to
i relieve his ennui. _ But he was pinched
j for time. Realizing that a protracted
| spree would meanjoss of hisemploy
j ment, he decided to squeeze the maxi
mum of inebriety into the minimum of
! duration. Experience had taught 1 him
| that the fastest run for his, money was
\u25a0 to be obtained.on the Barbary, Coast of
{ this city, and he decided to: take fqrry
i boat as soon as his day's toil . was
I ended, acquire .as heavy a load of
j whisky as he. could get aboard during
j the night and report for. work as usual
j in " the morning. The programme was
I fairly under" way when he was . ar
; rested by Patrolman. "Charlie" Brown,
; who found him in- hilarious mood on
i Kearny street. : Arrest X0.~2 was made
j about an hour. later by another officer
!on Pacific street 'and his thirds cap-
J ture was effected 'by the same vigilant,
| Mr: Brown,, who', found 'him reclining
t against, the Stevenson " Monument in
I Portsmouth Square. After his final re
i lease he went, to bed in a ' lodging-*

"Well, you didn't. have such a slow

There was a scurrying of lawyers
. in Judge Troutt's court yesterday
when the word went out that default
had been entered in- favor of Rebecca
Fleisher. kr.tfhn in litigation as the
Austrian -widow of the late Wolf
Fleisher. capitalist, and against Esther'
Fleisher, executrix of decedent's es-
t ate, for the full sum of the, judgment
\u2666 demanded by "the woman in far away
Austria, which is J B B, B OO. -The time
lor the defendant to answer to the
complaint of Rebecca Fleisher had
expired and Attorney Arthur Barendt
entered a default against her and pre
pared to present his proofs.
The fact that Barendt had stolen
the, march on them soon reached the
attorneys representing the administra
trix, and as a result they hurried late
yesterday afternoon to Judge Troutt's
court and pleaded for time Mn which
to file affidavits in support of a motion
â¢ to set aside the default and prevent,
if possible, an entry of Judgment. They
were granted the necessary time in
iihich to present these affidavits, but
if they fail to establish their conten
tion that the delay In filing the answer
â¢ was unavoidable. Mrs. Rebecca Fleish
er "will come into the fortune she
claims is hers without the trouble of
a contest. As the case now stands,
however, she has the better of the
controversy, as her" opponent must
take the initiative, while she stands on
the defensive.
She makes claim to one-half of the
property her husband held at the time
of her departure for Austria. This
property, she alleges in her suit, was
worth 5177,600. and all of it was com
munity property. , She alleges that he
â¢ *ent her to Austria under false pre
tenses in order to secure a divorce and
.xnarry another.
