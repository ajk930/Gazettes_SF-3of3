AUGUSTUS HEINZE WINS

copper property, worth many nrllions of dollars, will ftow pass into the permanent pos
session of the Amalgamated Company's bitterest foe, after one of the most sensational

of what the Panama Commission
would do In thie respect.
The determination to reduce rate* is
â¢aid to have been brought about by
Becretary Taft. The railway charges

be about 80 per cent of the total cost
of the shipment Valparaiso, IquiquÂ«

more cheaply than they could be sold

MAY WHEAT
DEAL ENDS
IN FAILURE
CHICAGO, April 20â The celebrated
deal In May vheat. attributed to John
W. Gates, received seemingly its death
blow to-day. Possibly as much as
6,000,000 bushels for May delivery was
dumped on the market. A* a result
there was a break of five cents a bushel
In the price, the quotations for May
falling from $1 13^i to Jl 08Â»*. Some
operators professed an opinion that ttfe
slump was due to heavy Eastern hold
ers of May wheat unloading because of
notable unrest in the stock market,
the alleged purpose of the sellers be
ing to get fr*e to protect securities in
Wall street. A much more prevalent
belief, however, was that Gates, tiring
lof the burden, had shifted the May
wheat deal to Armour and others.
One thing was said to be certainâ
that Gates had sold tremendous quan
tities to-day through at least one
house here. When the price of May
fell under $1 10, commission men poured
out on stop-loss orders. This
caused a breath-catching sheer drop to
$1 08%. The total sales of May were
estimated all the way from 3,000,000 to
5,000,000 bushel*.
While the bear turn was on in May,
the Armour people were supporting
July wheat against selling drives
caused by general rains. It was ar
gued that Armour's enormous buying
for July was for the Gates crowd,
either covering heavy short sales, made
from Si 01 down, or possibly, going
long for the Wall-street dealer. At the
close of the seesion May jumped back
to $1 10, leaving the net decline for the
day 3%c. July closed less than hie off
at 87%@87%c.

Battle.
HELENA. Mont.. April 20.â To-day,
for the second time, the Supreme Court
of Montana passed upon an appeal
from the judgment of the District
Court of Silver Bow County in the case
uf Miles Finlen against F. Augustus
Heinze. the Montana Ore Purchasing
company and others, better known as
the Minnie Healy case, involving title
to one of the rich copper mines in
Butte. Finlen had leases and bonds
upon the property from John Devlin,
Mrs. Devlin. Mrs. Reilly and Mrs. Kel
ly in 1898, agreeing to pay $100,000 for
those interests. Heinze claims to have
made a verbal agreement with Finlen
in November, IÂ«9S, to take over the
bonds and leases for $54,000 and under
the terms of that agreement began
working the property. This Finlen dis
puted and in February of the follow
ing year the present suit for posses
sion was commenced by Finlen.
The case was tried before Judge
Harney without a jury and Judgment
was rendered for the defendants In
December, 1898, Finlen having in the
meantime transferred his interest to
the Boston and Montana, now an
Amalgamated property.
The Amalgamated, or Finlen, ap
pealed to the Supreme Court, and a
new trial was granted, on the ground
that Harney had not acted properly
in the conduct of the trial. The case
was tried again before Judge Clancy In
August, 1903. and he decided for Heinze.
The Amalgamated again appealed, the
argument being made before the Su
preme Court last November.
To-day's decision, which was writ
ten by Associate Justice Holloway.
affirms the judgment of Judge Clancy,
holding in effect that there was a
verbal contract between Finlen and
Heinze by which Heinze should take
over Finlen's bonds and leases in the
mines. Under ah act passed by the
special session of the Legislature, the
Supreme Court was permitted to review
the evidence in the case, although It
was an equity proceeding.
Chief Justice Brantley dissented from
the .proposition and in a long opinion
questions the right of the Supreme
Court to go into the evidence In an
equity case unless a preponderance of
evidence favors such action.
The effect of the decision is to give
Heinze title to the mine, the value of
which is estimated In the millions.
It is said that if a Federal question
can be found upon which to base an
appeal, the Amalgamated interests will
appeal the case to the Supreme Court
of the United States.

Special, Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK. April 20. â Plans were
completed in Wall street to-day by
which funds for the construction of
the Western Pacific Railroad are ab
1 solutely assured. A syndicate of Wall
| street brokerage houses has agreed to
j buy $ 50,000,000 of bonds of this com
! pany, the proceeds of which will cora
i plete the line from Salt .Lake, Utah,
to Oakland. Cal.
Three important banking-houses, it
is understood, will participate in the
bond issue. They are Blair & Co.,
Salomen & Co. and W. A. Head & Co.
The final conferences have been held
in Wall street during the last tew
days.
As is generally known, the Western
Pacific Itailroad will become an in
tegral part of the Gould system,
.stretching from the Atlantic to the
Pacifk. When the new line, for the
construction of which the $50,000,000
bonds are to be issued, shall have
been completed the combined system
will be the first railroad in the United
Slates under one control with termin
als on the Atlantic aid Pacific oceans.
The Canadian Paci-lc now touches
both oceans. Thy Gould system's
Western terminus is'at present at Salt
Lake, where the Denver and Rio
Grande and the Rio Grande Western
now end. These properties also ter
minate at Denver and Pueblo, where
the great Missouri Pacific finds its ter
minal. This latter system carries the
Gould properties as far as St. Louis,
where the Wabash, also under Gould
control, connects and brings business
as far East at Pittsburg. The Wabash
is now building into Pittsburg through
the Wabash,-Pittsburg Terminal
Railroad, from the presidency of
which Joseph Ramsey Jr. recently re
signed. The West Virginia Central
and the Plttsburg and Western Mary
land carry the Gould system to the
Atlantic.
Thus, when the Western Pacific
shall have been constructed, one ter
minal of the Gould lines will be locat
ed at Oakland, on the Pacific, while
Baltimore, on the Atlantic, will be the
other.
FORESEES DEATH
OF HIS FRIEND
LOS ANGELES, April 20.â Three
days before Dr. Martin L. V. Russell
of Mount Carmel was struck and killed
by a Santa Monica car he was warned
that he would be killed by a street
car.
Upon the afternoon of the Wednes
day preceding his death Dr. Russell,
who formerly lived in Los Angeles,
met Dr. .1. A. Mead, a retired physician
who had been one of his neighbors.
They stopped and chatted for a few
minutes. Suddenly, without a word
having been said to lead up to such
an unusual remark, Dr. Mead Inter
rupted Dr. Russell in the midst of a
sentence, saying:
"Russell, I want you to be very care
ful of yourself while you are around
the streetcars for the next few days."
"Why so?"
"You may laugh at me for saying
bo," Dr. Mead answered, "but while
you were talking to me just now I felt
a sort of chill running up and down my
spine, and immediately I had the im
pression that you were to be killed by
a streetcar within a short time. If you
will take my advice you will walk very
carefully when you are near cars for
a few days at least."
'I haven't a great deal of faith in
hunches myself," Dr. Russell replied
with a laugh. "Besides, I never ride
upon the streetcars when I can help
it. I prefer to walk."
On Saturday last Dr. Russell, while
crossing a street, was struck and killed
by an electric car.

Croesus of the fcand Dies Steadfast
in His Love for Girl Who
Spurned Him.
OMAHA. Neb., April 20.âNotwith
standing that he was twice jilted by
Miss Mattie Cannon, an Omaha girl
(now Mrs. Joseph Munchhoft), Claude
Henderson Heron, the South African
diamond king, worth two years ago
$50,000,000. has left his entire estate to
her. The first news of her good fortune
reached Mrs. Munchhoff through a ca
blegram from Pretoria, which she re
ceived in Denver while visiting with
friends there. She is now on her way
to California. Her friends here say the
fortune left her by Heren is but a rem
nant of what he was worth at one time
and estimate it at $5,000,000.
Mrs. Munchhoff's father is L. V. Can
non, president of the P. V. Maple
Syrup Company of Quebec. Heren was
the principal of a rival concern, the
Main Wood Syrup Company. When
Mattie Cannon was a tiny child he
spent hours playing with her, taking
her on little excursions and amusing
her in childish games. For years he
cherished the hope that she would some
day become his wife, but when ho pro
posed both Mattie and her father told
him she was too young for him.
Miss Cannon fell in love with and
married Munchhoff. whom she met
while he was collecting fares on a mer
ry-go-round at an Omaha resort. When
Heren heard of the match he sold his
business in Quebec and left. Several
years later it was learned that he was
in South Africa, where he had amassed
a fortune of $50,000,000. The story of
his association with Kwalfey and of his
sensational split with him at Monte
Carlo, where Heren is said to have spat
upon Kwalfey's face and branded him
a coward before a large assembly, came
to the Cannons and Munchhoffs
through the brief press dispatches.
Heren ran through his Immense
wealth as rapidly as he acquired it. He
bought circuses and vaudevilles for a
week's entertainment for his friends.
He established churches and libraries,
bought railroads and steamship lines
and forgot the deals as soon as they
were made.
Meantime, Mrs. Munchhoff and her
husband found life anything but bliss
ful and their matrimonial venture
quickly ended in the divorce courts.
Heren, hearing of the separation,
again pressed his suit for the hand of
Miss Mattie Cannon Munchhoff and
was refused a second time. He died
several months ago.
was refused a second time. He died
several months ago.
After obtaining her divorce Mrs.
Munchhoff left this city, but has been
a regular visitor and has many friends
here. She is a beautiful blonde of 26 or

official communication issued after the
meeting announced that Minister Mo

a formal protest against an alleged
violation of neutrality, but was to ob
t-surances that France would ob

XoTwithstanding the official version
It is evident that the intention and ef

pointing out the precautions that had

to ailay the apprehensions of Japan,
which, he maintained, had not been

I LOR HAS DEPARTED. ,
It is maintained that the fleet's so

that the squadron actually left Kara-

therefore, it is held, it has not tlv- char

1/O.MKJ.VS ATTITVnE CALM.
LONDON, April Â».â Notwithstanding
emphatic protests of some of the
s and shrieks of indignation
from the jingo press, British Govern
ment officials decline to admit that
there is anything in the Far Eastern
situation to cuuse excitement or to
show that it approaches an acute
sta.ge. In other words, the Foreign
office assumes the attitude of a much
interested spectator of an intensely
dramatic situation which is approach
ing a climax in which by some mis
chance Gnat Bn'^in might be called
upon to play a part.
The announcement in the Paris dis
patches that Dr. Motono. the Japanese
Minister there, has called upon For
eign Minister Dek-asse with regard t >
the question of neutrality, has not
changed the views of officials at the
Foreigrj Office, where it was pointed out
to-day that Japan probably had not
made a formal protest, but simply de
f<ired assurances that France would
< ontinu* to neutrality and
not afford the Russians any advantage
inconsistent with France's responsibil
ities as a neutral. The Foreign OffiVo
assumes that France most certainly
will give some assurance to Japan.
NO ACTION NECESSARY.
The Foreign Office stated that it was
not at all likely that Great Britain
would be required to take action in
Fupport of any protest. The attitude
if the Foreign Office is that there is
not as yet any proof that neutrality
lias been violated and it prefers to
believe that France is preserving neu
trality according to her own inter
pretation and that Russia would not
willfully involve her ally.
It is pointed out that similar charges
were brought when Vice Admiral Ro-
Jestvensky's squadron was at Nossl
be and that there is no reason to be
lieve that there is any ground for the
charge of actual violation of neutrality
at Kamranh Bay.

YOUNG TOOK
HIS OWN LIFE
So Declares Tailor Who Says
He Witnessed the Tragedy
That Caused the Arrest of
Naii Patterson for Murder
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CHICAGO, April 20â After seven
months silence, a Chicago man to-night
made the assertion that he witnessed
the shooting of Caesar Young in New
1 York last June and that the shot was
fired by the bookmaker himself and not
\<y "Nan" Patterson, who is now on
trial for the third time, charged with
Young's murder. The new factor in
the celebrated case is Lewis Kissen
berg, h tailor, who lived in New York.
to the scene of the tragedy, at
the time it was enacted.
"I saw Caesar Young shoot himself."
said Eissenberg to-night. "I cannot
read English, and thought very little
about the matter. Had I known that
i. young woman was accused of mur
dering the man I would have told my
story long ago."
Eissenberg: tells in .a straightforward
manner what he claims to have seen
and declares he would have died with
his knowledge of the affair had not his
relative. Ben Rosen, a cigarmaker.
with whom he now lives. Induced him
to make a clean breast of it all. He
said:
"One day about the beginning of
June, as I walked along West Broad
way a cab with a man and a fine-look
ing woman in it came along at mod
erate speed. A man walking fast could
keep up with the cab for a short dis
tance. The woman in the cab was cry
ing. I heard a noise In the cab for a
few seconds before I turned. I soon
saw that the man was very much in
toxicated. I stopped and looked into
the cab. As they were almost abreast
of me, the woman suddenly screamed.
I saw the man take something from
her pocket with his left hand and
heard a shot.
"Immediately after the shooting the
woman screamed very loudly. She
tried to rise, but the man's head and
c-hest had fallen forward and Dartlv
into her lap. Then she cried again to
the driver, who was all excited, and
the cab went away in a hurry. I ran
after it for a short distance and then
gave up the chase.
"I understood from what by-stand
ers said that the man was only slightly
wounded. Soon after I left New York
seeking work and thought nothing of
it until I picked up a Jewish paper
telling of the woman's third trial."

AUGUSTUS HUE WINS.
Continued From Page 1, Column 3.
complex history of American liti
gation there is no lawsuit more re
markable than that waged to deter
mine the ownership of the Minnie Hea
ly copper mine. Millions of dollars'
worth of copper and silver have been
taken out of the mine and there is
now blocked out ore worth more mil
lions of dollars. Ten yars ago one
could have bought the mine for a song.
A million dollars has been spent by
Heinze in defending his title to the
Minnie Healy and the Amalgamated
Copper Company has spent a quarter
of a million trying to prove ownership.
The story of the Minnie Healy be
gan when John Devlin and his friends
cut the grass roots near Meaderville,
uncovering an insignificant looking
vein which never yielded them a dol
lar. Devlin went "broke" and in
duced Miles Plnlen, who was then
working with Marcus Daly, the late
copper king, to take hold of the prop
erty, with Daly'B backing. They se
cured a lease and bond in 1896 and Fin
len spent more than $50,000 without
taking out enough ore to pay his en
gineers.
One night, in the old 98 Club, the
Minnie Healy was mentioned. It had
become a sore spot with Daly. Turn
ing savagely on Finlen, he told him
that to operate the Minnie Healy was
throwing good money after bad and
urged him to unload it somewhere. In
1898 Finlen was preparing to pull up
the pumps of the Healy, when a bright
idea struck him. He would unload it
on Heinze. Heinze was then a young
operator. He verbally agreed to take
Finlen's lease, to pay Devlin $75,000 and
to pay Finlen $54,000. The latter
amount was what Finlen declared he
had lost. He claimed he wanted only
' to get even.
Finlen had never signed any papers
i with Heinze and when the almost fab-
I ulous riches of the Minnie Healy were
j struck Finle,n rushed back to Butte
I from Chicago and with Daly attempt-
Ed to regain possession of the mine.
Heinze stood them off from behind a
barricade.
Thus started the cauaa which devel
oped the bitter copper war between
F. Augustus Heinze and the Amalga
mated Copper Company. Lawsuit
after lawsuit followed, the mine being
closed by injunction a half dozen
times. The trouble eventually caused
the Amalgamated to suspend opera
tions In Montana, throwing 30,000 men
out of employment and paralyzing
business conditions.
Judge E. W. Harney, on June 18,
1801, declared Heinze to be the owner
of the Minnie H^aly in a suit brought
by Finlen, backed by the Boston and
Montana Company of the Amalga
mated group, the latter having acquir
ed the Daly interests.
Then followed the notorious Ada
Brackett scandal, Amalgamated detec
tives Intercepting "Dearie" letters pur
porting to have passed between Judge
Harney and the woman, one of
Heinze's stenographers, who. It was al
leged, acted as Heinze's agent to in
fluence the decision. Many of the let
ters were too risque to be printed.
When the investigation was on, Har
ney appeared in court intoxicated and
armed with a revolver. Hartley's con
duct was the cause of the granting of
a new trial of the case.
Harney was offered $250,000 if he
would acknowledge he had been bribed
by Heinze and as a result charged T.
J. Shores, chief counsel for Amalga
mated, and Charles W. Clark with bri
bery. The charges were not sustained.
D. Gay Stivers, another Amalgamated
attorney, it was alleged, offered Mrs.
Brackett $25,000 to confess she had
"worked" Judge Harney for Helnxe
through professions of love.
Upon the retrial of the famous case
Judge William Clancy for the second
time awarded the mine to Heinze and
this decision Is now affirmed by the

GEORGE ADE BACK
Three men who witnessed the famous
fifteen-day battle of Mukden arrived
yesterday from the Orient on the liner
Korea. As a climax to the two weeks
of excitement the three witnesses were
captured by the enemy. They are now
on their way home to tell of their ex
periences. Two of them will whisper
their tale to the Secretary of War and
to nobody else. The third will tell
what he has not already told in the
columns of the Chicago newspaper
which sent him to the front with Kuro
patkin's force*.
The three prisoners of war are Col
onel V. Havard. assistant surgeon
general of the United States army;
Captain W. V. Judson of the engineer
corps and Richard H. Little, war cor
respondent for the Chicago News. They
were all attached to the Russian army.
Bound by the rules under which they
were allowed to accompany the Czar's
forces, the army officers may not dis
cuss their experiences. Upon Little,
however, there is no restriction and he
has much of thrilling interest to tell
cf that bloody engagement.

TWO ARMY OFFICERS AND A SEWSPAPER CORRESPONDENT WHO WERE CAPTTRED BY THE JAPANESE AT THE
RATTLE OF MTKDEX TWO NAVAL OFFICERS AND A WELL-KNOWN AUTHOR ALL OF WHOM ARRIVED FROM
THE ORIENT YESTERDAY ON THE KOREA.
the Japanese were preparing to close
in on the enemy, a blinding sand
storm caused general confusion. The
Japanese, unable to Bee where they
were going, halted.
It was at this stage that Little wit
nessed what he describes as the crazi
est and bravest deed he ever saw sol
dier dare. Before the sand storm the
Russians, in their trenches, had seen
the Japanese advancing in great force.
The sand shut them from the Russian
view. A Russian captain of artillery
suddenly ordered his men to charge the
enemy. Out from the shelter of the
trenches the Russian soldiers dragged
eight guns and at full gallop the
little battery disappeard in the direc
tion of the enemy. When close to the
Japanese line the battery got into ac
tion and began pouring a murderous
fire into the Japanese lines.
This sudden onslaught threw the
Japanese into disorder and they were
preparing to deal with a large force,
when a sudden clearing of the air
showed them the eight-gun battery,
out on the open plain, without shelter,
boldly defying the hosts of the Mikado.
The artillery officer got safely back
to the Russian lines with four of
his guns. His -bold interference had
no effect on the final outcome, but it
served to delay the Japanese advance
and did much to steady the Russian
retreat.
Neither Little nor the two military
attaches who returned with him on the
Korea had any idea that they would
be captured. From the information
available they were in the safest pos
sible position. Suddenly the orderly
retreat broke Into the wildest kind of
confusion and Japanese became mixed
up with Russians in a most bewilder
ing way. And then the capture and
for the captives, peace.
When it became evident that the
Russians were abandoning Mukden.
says Little, the Chinese residents of
the place opened fire on the Czar's
forces from the windows of their
house*, killing many.
ANXIOUS FOR CAPTURE.
Among the Russians were hundreds
only too anxious to be captured. These
loitered behind and added to the diffi
culties of the Russian officers in charge
of the retreat. Other Russians looted
the vodka shops, became intoxicated
and playfully fired at friend and foe
as they reele<s about the streets of the
town. With the coming of the Jap
anese in force order was quickly re
stored and the non-combatant prison
ers of war were soon on their way to
Tokio, homeward bound.
Little has served with distinction, as
war correspondent, in Cuba and In the
Philippines and enjoys a natioul repu
tation as a newspaper man.
George Ade. who has promised to
write no more fables in slang, and who
left here on the Korea, returned on the
liner yesterday. He enjoyed the trip
but wishes he had traveled under an
other name. He met many people and
declares that nearly every Introduction
was followed by a strange Bilence while
the person introduced puckered up his
face in apparent readiness to show
proper approval when the man whose
witty pen has won him wealth and a
name should say something funny.
In trying to live down his reputation
for humor Ade has acquired an almost
funereal cast of countenance. He says
he enjoyed the fresh air, feels fine and
is ready to tackle some hard work he
has mapped out for himself.

BUNKER'S TRIAL
DRAWS CROWDS
SACRAMENTO, April 20.â The inter
est in the trial of former Senator Harry
Bunkers for bribery is im .Teasing and
the courtroom was crowded all day.
George N. Tichenor told the tale of his
entrapping the accused and reiterated
it on cross-examination, while Joseph
S. Jordan began his story of corrupt
negotiations with the Senators charged
with accepting money to control their
acts as legislators in the matter of in
vestigating building and loan associa
tions. â¢
Tichenor. who is an inspector for the
Continental Building ana Loan Asso
ciation of San Francisco, gave his tes
timony clearly and told of his con
nection with the trapping of Bunkers
and associates.
On cross-examination Tichenor said
he brought the money to Sacramento
to entrap the Senators on the basis of
the suppression of supposed facts rel
ative to the Renters' Trust and the
Phoenix Building Associations. He was
told that the plan was to trap the Sen
ators on the line of preventing investi
gation.
In all his conversation with Jordan
the latter understood that the money
was paid to have protection. Jordan
did not know a trap was being pre
pared through his agency.
Jordan, who was next called, told of
his dealings with the defendant, but
his testimony was not concluded when
the court adjourned until 10 o'clock this
morning.

KEEPS CAKGO OF COAL
Failure to Sell Shipload
of Fuel Does Not Prevent
Carrying of Brown Men
HONOLT'LU, April 20.â At 310 this
afternoon the steamship Olympia sail
ed for Seattle carrying 577 Japanese
men and 16 Japanese women, who, it
Es reported, are under contract to work
->n the Groat Northern Railroad in
Montana. The Olympia is also carry
ing back to .Seattle the cargo of coal
local merchants refused to purchase.
Soon after the steamship -Myrr.pia
arrived at Honolulu the coal merchants
l> i ariied that the vessel intended tak
ing away a large number of Japanese
laborers. When Captain Truebridge
found that he could not sell privately
the 1600 tons of coal carried by the
Olymnta he offered it last Tuesday at
public . auction. There were no bid
ders, and Truebridge declared that an
"un-American boycott" had been de
clare] agair.st his cargo.
Tho merchants of Honolulu declare
that a repetition of such trips as the
one ma<lo by the Glympla would seri
ously injure the labor supply of the
Hawaiian Islands.
will run down the scent of an enemy,
locate him and report to the fighting
force. Three of these craft, with a
maximum speed of twenty-four knots,
have been ordered, and when the next
batch of them is planned by the con
struction department it is thought that
a knot and a fraction will be added to
the speed.
England has scout ships that are
slightly faster than those now fairly
under way of building for the United
States. Japan has a fleet of them
that average about twenty-four knots,
and it was with these that the wily
Togo was enabled to find the Russian
position! with such accuracy and pre
pare to meet and destroy the Slav
fleet in accordance with design made
possible by the scout ships' good ser
vice. The construction bureau claims
that the American ships will be su
perior to those of Japan and England
because Of their large coal capacity.
The American vessels will carry twice
the coal in their bunkers than can the
Japanese and English. Their hulls
are so planned as to combine excessive
strength of frame with a minimum of
weight. Extreme care has been used
to prevent "stiffness." that the vessels
may withstand all manner of weather
and* maintain a high average of speed
despite the elements.
The three scout ships will be called
the Chester, Birmingham and Salem.
In appearance they will be long and
narrow, schooner rigged and some
what low of freeboard. They are to
have four funnels and their super
structure is not much in evidence
above the main deck. Their batteries
will consist of twelve 3-inch rapid fire
guns for repelling torpedo-boat at
tacks: they are also to be provided
with two submerged torpedo tubes and
can serve as torpedo craft if neces
sary.
Great difficulty has been experienced
by all navies of the world in maintain
ing anything like the contract speed
of torpedo-beats for any length of
time. ThÂ° scout ships are expected to
keep up their maximum speed, or near
ly so, for an indefinite time without
injury to their machinery.

ONLY ONE BEAR
TAKEN THUS FAR
Tireless President Follows
Hounds All Day in the
Hope of Getting Grizzlies
LOEB VISITS THE CAMP
Finds His Chief Still in the
Saddle After a Ten-Hour
Hide Without Luncheon
GLEXWOOD SPRINGS, Colo., April
20. â That President Roosevelt is en
joying royal sport in his hunt for
Rocky Mountain grizzlies is attested
by Secretary L,oeb, who returned from
the camp late to-day afteik having
spent the night with the party. While
the only game pulled down thus far is
the bear shot by the President and the
bobcat shot by Dr. Alexander Lam
bert there has been plenty of recrea
tion. Every day the dogs have fol
lowed trails that looked promising,
showing that there are more bears to
be found in the vicinity now being
hunted.
Secretary Loeb left Glenwood
Springs yesterday morning with Elmer
Chapman, the courier who brought
out the first word from the camp.
They went to Newcastle, procured
mounts and rode the twenty-three
miles to the Charley Penny Ranch.
When about three miles from camp
they heard the baying of hounds hot
on the trail of game. They waited and
soon the entire hunting party rode up.
The President and his companions had
been In the saddle ten hours without
stopping for luncheon, so dinner was
served soon after their arrival at
camp. Loeb says it was only neces
sary to see them eat to know that the
hunters were in the best of health
and enjoying themselves.
During the dinner and afterward the
President and Loeb had a long visit.
Naturally the secretary wanted to
know all about the bear which the
President had killed. It was an inter
esting story, in which all members of
the party shared In the telling.
The dogs had several times caught
up with the bear and had annoyed him
until he was in a vicious mood. Final
ly, when he was at bay, two or three
members of the party, including the
President, came up with the dogs. One
dog had been killed and several others
badly wounded and the bear was play
ing havoc with the others that were
tantalizing him.
To save the dogs the President had
to shoot hurriedly. Every sweep of the
bear's paw bowled over a hound and
rather than see more of the pack
killed the President took the chance
of shooting between the dogs at the
bear. He fired once and hit the ani
mal in the shoulder. Firing again, he
killed his game. He takes great pride
in the first trophy of the hunt.
CHICAGO, April 20. â President
Roosevelt, from his snowbound hunt

visit to the city.
According to the plan approved, the

tendered a reception at the Hamilton
Club and in the evening he will be the

Claim Is Made That Trans

NEW YORK, April 20.â MacGrane

iel J. Sully case, to-day Bent to 'â  Judge
Holt of the ; United States District
Court an opinion which, if approved
by the court, will reopen the Sully case
entirely and- bring up for adjudication
several important and almost sensa
tional points. The opinion is given
upon the application of two sets of pe
titions â one from Edwin Hawley j and
Frank ; H. Ray, who have been Sully's
trustees in bankruptcy* for certain
sums alleged to have been lost through
participation with Sully in alleged cot
ton pools, and the others from credit
01-3 who are not members of the Cot
ton . Exchange. :' ,:' â 'â 'â â  '-,. -. :\
Three questions were brought vp â
first, whether $1,000,000 paid on Satur
day, March ' 13, 904, was 'a , preference
and so illegal; second, whether the
Friday's prices or Saturday's prices
should determine the amount the Sully
estate owes, and, third, whether trans
actions on the Cotton Exchange are
gambling transactions. â¢
The opinion of the referee is that the
case should be reopened. If Judge
Holt decides in favor of this it will re
open the whole question, and if , the
claims are decided it will make an im
mense difference in the amounts due.
If it is proved that Cotton Exchange
transactions are gambling transactions
Sully is solvent and will not owe .". a

OF INSANE MAN
NORFOLK, Va., April 20.â The latest
relative of Thomas Yandaw, deceased,
who, it recently developed, was largely
interested in a California fortune of
more than $1,500,0*00, is Antoine Yan
daw of 220 Main street, Chicopee Falls,
Mass., who says he is the brother of
the deceased Norfolk man. The Chico
pee Falls man is 76 years of age and
gives a description of the Thomas
Yandaw, who was his brother, which
compares in many particulars with the
Thomas- Yandaw of Norfolk, who died
in the Williamsburg asylum. The
Massachusetts man says he and his
brother were born in Vermont and that
Thomas early in life went to Califor
nia, where he lived for some time be
fore coming to Virginia. The brother

BANKER SCHIFF TO WAR
UPON CHICAGO STRIKERS
New Yorker Will Have Charge of
Freight Handling Operations in
Chicago.
CHICAGO, April 20.â Jacob H.
Schiff of New York is going to be the
great freight handling head of Chi
cago in the future.
Recent developments in the conduct
of affairs of the Teamsters' Union, the
coming concert of agreement among
the terminal railways as to how
wholesale and retail freight shall be
handled, and the powerful junction of
banking and railway interests of New
York and this city in the Illinois Tun
nel Company, point to Schiff as the
executive head of the city's freight
problems.
Indeed, it is frankly said in La Salle
street that Schiffs influence is at work
with a view to eventually ending- all
possibility of future team strikes and
the tying-up of large freight tonnage.
The teaming tonnage over which
the Schiff brain will have control al
ready aggregates within the city limits
more than 47,000,000 tons, and of this
between 36,000.000 and 37.000,000
tons are handled within the downtown
district.
The banking house of which Schiff
is the head is that of Kuhn, Loeb
& Co.

Ringleader Plans Four Fires In Nor-

NORFOLK, Neb., April 20.â Taking
their cue from dime novels, which
they admit they have been reading,
three beardless boys have in the last
few weeks started fires which have ag
gregated losses of $100,000. Bert
L,uke, a tall, slender lad of 18, the
ringleader, has escaped and is be
lieved to be now in Omaha. Earl
Fairbanks, also 18, was bailed out by
his father, and the third lad, still
younger, having turned State's wit
ness, has been released.
Fairbanks told of their escapades
as though they were mere incidents
in a boy's life. When asked what their
motive was he replied: "Luke, who was
going to leave town, said he wanted
to have a devil of a time before he
left. He proposed to start four fires
in different parts of the town and then
to assist in putting them out He told
us that If we ever breathed a word he
would shoot our heads off."

SANTA FE LINE
TO CUT RATES
LOS ANGELES, April 20.â The Santa
Fe passenger department to-day an
nounced an important cut in rates be
tween Los Angeles and Chicago and
Los Angeles and Kansas City to take
effect at a specified time which consti
tutes a reduction not yet sanctioned
by the Transcontinental Passenger As
sociation. It' is not expected that a
rate war will result, but that other
roads will shortly follow the Santa Fe's
example.
The several transcontinental lines
some time ago announced a single
fare for the round trip between Los
Angeles and various Eastern points, on
account of several important conven
tions and other gatherings in Eastern
cities. The Santa Fe to-day announced
that this single fare for the round trip
would apply also between Los Angeles
and Chicago and Los Angeles and Kan
sas City on the dates specified in the
announcement of convention rates
association. This makes a round trip
rate to Chicago from Los Angeles of
$72 50, and a round trip rate to Kan
sas City from Los Angeles of $60.
This is approximately one-half of the
present rates. It is confidently ex
pected that the Southern Pacific. Union
Pacific, Rock Island and other com
peting lines will shortly meet this re
duction. The reduced rate tickets
will be good for sixty days.
If you get in the habit of saying
good things of people, you will be sur
prised at how many more you can
think of.

land fraud cases in this State will have
pleaded.
United States District Attorney
Francis J. Heney expects to return to
San Francisco on that day to remain
until such time as the first case is set
for trial.
In case the Government wins in the
Mitchell abatement proceedings it is
the present understanding that all the
land fraud cases will be pressed to
early trial.
While it Is not known which of the
cases will be tried first, it is believed
that it will be the one against Senator
Mitchell, in which he entered the plea
In abatement. This is the case in
which it Is charged that Senator
Mitchell accepted money for practicing
before a Government department while
an official of the Government in a case
in which *he Government was directly
interested.

PROMISES TO WRITE
HISTORY OF QUARREL
Declares That to Step Down
and Out Now Would 'Be
Cowardly and a Disgrace to
the Memory of His Father
KEW YORK, April M.â After First j
Vice President James H. Hyde of the j
able Liife Ajsauranoe Society had
informed a committee of managing '
agents this afternoon thai it would be .
Impossible because of previous engage- '
merits to address '>Â»Â»" to-day, the |
agents' convention, which had been in ]
session in this city for three days, ad- j
Jourced without naming a day. Hyde j
said, however, thai he would prepare ;
a . statement and transmit It to the â¢
cbnimiUc-e, covering the situation as he j
conceived it- i
The invitation to address the agents j
was followed by a call of a. committee i
on Hyde with â  request that he resign j
as an officer of the company. This Hyde (
declined to do in ,-. address in which j
he said he would consider such an ac- j
lion "unworthy and disgraceful to the 1
memory of my father."
These were the developments of the i
session which began at the Hotel j
Savoy this morning. Permanent or- I
caniration was effected and officers j
chosen. The executive committee of Â»
the Equitable also met to-day in Pres- ;
ident Alexander's office, but other than !
the announcement that the demand for
Hyde's resignation was discussed noth- |
ir.s was given out.
The committee on investigation, of I
which H. C. Frick is chairman, was in |
session in the course of the day and ;
unanimously agreed to employ former '
United States Attorney General Knox !
;*s counsel. In connection with legal :
> nds in the Equitable tangle to-day's
announcement that Elihu Root re- j
mains as one of Hyde's counsel in |
of the stories to the contrary was j
interesting. The retaining of Joseph ',
H. Choate as one of the Hyde counsel â 
was also confirmed.
STRONG RESOLUTION.
There was same talk to-night of a j
settlement of the difficulties between t
tht Hyde and Alexander parties, but j
no confirmation could be secured, j
Shortly before the adjournment of the ;
a gents this afternoon this resolution 1
was unanimously adopted:
W*hÂ«rÂ»is. Aa we believe that when we return
to our homes Â«> shull be in . position to
oon\icce our pcHcv-hoiien tha.t tceir cause
is belnjr rucceesfully champitrnwi: and whereaa,

â -iÂ«>'m affalrr: and whereas, policy -holders* ',
< <-rr.rn!tteÂ«s are being 'jrgÂ»niied in various j
parts of the country; thereforÂ© be it
Resolved. That this body recommend â¢ -. each \
<~f its member* the necessity, until* hit return ;
M M- field, at crra&izing his policy-holders j
into a compact body prepared to demand and ]
enforce their right* under his leadership, and ;
that he Immediately proceed to organize his ]
agency force to act as his lieutenants In a i
taspaijn of this kind, invitln* his policy- j
hoM<--n? to cotnnsnnicate through nlm with the
oTficers and directors of the society -â¢â¢ad of !
ailowlr.g themselves to be drawn into organlza- ;
lion* not so thoroughly equipped for brimcins j
about â nhat every policy -holder of the society i
ardently desired.
The resolution was introduced by F. I
H. Hazleton of Portland, Me., although ]
it was admitted by officers of the !
organization of managing agents that j
he was not its author. The identity >
of the author was not revealed. ;
The special committee left for Syra- ,
cuse to-night to wait on Superintend- j
ent.of Insurance Hendricks to-morrow, j
From there the committee will go to |
Albany. Members of the conference to- j
day -signed applications for a total of j
Jl,<>oo,o<)o of additional insurance on )
their lives, the statement being made '
that this was done as a .compliment j
to President Alexander and as an ex- '
pression of their confidence in him.
It was learned officially to-night that i
the vote on the resolution exiling for j
Hyde's resignation was 174 to 11.
The committee called at Hyde's home i
at I Fast Fortieth street. Hyde j
and his secretary received the commit- i
tee alone. The committee remained in |
the house twelve minutes and returned ;
to the Hotel Savoy. -Bowes, as chair- ;

Brain
Workers.
Brain workers suffer from
headache because they over-tax
and exhaust the brain nerves.
Tired, irritated, turbulent
brain nerves throb and ache;
this weakens the brain power,
and robs the memory.
Dr. Miles' Anti-Pain Pills
bring tranquility to the ex-
cited nerves and stop the pain.
If not relieved, this nerve
disturbance is frequently ex-
tended to the stomach, 4 causing
nausea, vomiting â sick head-
ache.
Dr. Miles' Anti-Pain Pills
are convenient to take â a
little tablet, that in a few mo-
ments relieves the pain; they
leave no disagreeable after-
effects, as they contain no
opium, morphine, cocaine or
chloral in any form.
"From personal experience I can
testify that Dr. Miles' Anti-Pain Pills
are a most excellent remedy for head*
ache and neuralgia- I have been a
great sufferer from both diseases for
the past three years. A friend who
had also suffered from neuralgia
handed me some of the Anti-Pain
Pills. I took them and they gave me
almost Instant relief. Since then I
have a package at home, and another
at the office, and they nÂ»vÂ»r fall to
relieve me." R. .V. MEGART.

Texas, and had not been opened since
leaving that place.
The discovery of the human cargo
â¢'as made by chance by Policemen
Shannon and Narvaez. The two offi
cers were in the freight yard looking
around for suspicious characters, when
a noise in the oar, which had just come
into the yard, attracted their atten
tion. The matter was reported at the
railroad office; the car was opened and
che nineteen Chinese were found in
various attitudes^ Some were sleeping
on the floor and others eating. Two
five-gallon cans of water, two sacks of
bread and plenty of blankets were in
the car. The police patrol wagon was
summoned and the men taken to the
City Prison.
CARRIED INSTRUCTIONS.
A search showed that each had In
his poes*Â»ssinn a little book, a few dol
lars in nvn-^y and some miscellaneous
â me in the party could
taik Rnglish. He appeared to be the
leader <>f the crowd and gave the name
- Hop. The books taken from the
men were all aJike and were a sort of
> a tech ism prepared in Chinese, so that
they could answer Questions asked
them ab^rrt this country. A number
of letters were found in their posses
hat had be<Â»n written in San
Francisco and addressed to parties in
â o.
Sue Hop said that the party was
landed at Ouaymas by a sailing vessel
from China. The trip to El Paso was
made in a boxcar. After a stay there
of several days he and his companions
were again furnished with water and
provisions and loaded into the car
from which they were taken at the
depot in this city. They passed safe
ly all along the line from the Texas
city to" San Jose, arriving here at 12:45
this morning.
This afternoon Chief of Immi
gration Bureau Charles Mehan. As
sistant United States Attorney . Mc-
Kir.ley and Inspector Gassoway, ac
compar.ip] hy a number of interpreters
and ster ographers, arrived and began
an examination of the Chinese.
TELL. OOVFTjICTIVG STORIES
The Chinese were questioned sep
arately, but little was learned from
them. The officials are satisfied that
the men were smuggled into this coun
try and that the work waÃ done by an
organized gang operating in Mexico.
Sue Hop was recognized by Chief
MÂ»han as a Chinese he knew in Ari
zona in 1Â«95. Hop admits he was in
this country off and on for years.
From the examination of the Chinese
it was learned that the party left El
Paso on April 13. They claim they en
tered the car alone and were not pilot
ed by any one. and also each claims
they walked across the bridge at El
Paso from Mexico. One Chinese ad
mitted that the second night cut the
rar was opened by a Mexican, who re
plenished their supply of food and
vater. The Chinese all claim to be
from Chihuahua and surrounding
towiiaj, and. with the exception of Sue
Hop, admit that they had never before
been in this country. They refuse to
give any information as to the pro
moter of the scheme. The Mongolians
vill be taken to San Francisco to-mor

agents now aasembled In the Hotel Savoy that
you voluntarily resign your position as vice

-â¢-quest of the convention:
James E Hyde, vtce president of the Equit
able L4fe Assurance Society of America.: We,
the general agents and manager* of thp Equit
able, assembled In convention from ali parts
at the t'nited State* and Canada, are person
ally and through our agents in close touch
with tbe people and. knowlntr. the deep-Â«eate<i
â¢:on of the policy-holders, and deeply iie
k the necessity for our action, therefore
ely and earnestly appeal to you on be
â  Equitable, to the creation and up
building of whlrh your father devoted his life.
r the sake of Its policy-holders and its
agents, tc set aeide all personal Interests and
now voluntarily retire from the vice presi
dency.
Bowes, after reading the agents'
communication to Hyde, made a short
speech, in which he said. In part:
Mr. Hyde, with regard to thii request, there
are a number of points I wish to emphasize
particularly. I want to call your attention to
a char&eterietJc of the request, that It was
after four or five hours' deliberation;
therefore It was not hastily done. I want to
f-aJI your attention to another feature of this
request, that It was made by managers and
agents from all part* of the country- I want
to call >t-ur attention to another feature of the
â¢ that It was made by agents, every
whom la actuated by the moat intense
. to the Equitable, whose hearts beat in
?>mpaÂ»'iy with the progress, welfare and
of the institution founded by your
father.
Mr. Hyde, this Is a supreme moment tn
story. It la a supreme moment In the
of the Equitable. I beg of you re
ly, but In a spirit of the utmost good
â hat you will take this request under
consideration and give It attention at the ear
hest :>isslb!e moment.
rlydf's reply to the committee was,
in part, as follows:
â¢ a first place. I have no Intention of re
?ig-ning the office of the vice presidency of the
Equitable. Such a course I would consider
Bod a disgrace to the memory of
my father Second, it Is evident from your
extraordinary request and from the report of
c^edings at y.*ur meeting that you have
â¢ r'tion of thla unfortu
nate or the motive* behind the
for the control of the society.
wevfr. that you are entitled to
know something of the real facts on which
my attitude la based, and I will, therefore,
write yrÂ»u to-morrow in reply to the request
ir.ao> In this remarkable communication.
I think, however, that -^ your request might
have been far more justified had It . been him?
to those having no interest in the society who
precipitated this unfortunate : controversy, and
ar* keeping the agitation alive to serve their
own selfish . purposes. You will . hear further
from me to-morrow. /

BAEHR STOPS OVERDRAFT
ON CITY HOSPITAL FUNDS
, Auditor Withholds Payment on De
mands Which Exceed One- Twelftli
of Annual Appropriation.
Owing to the fact that "Warden
1 Fleming of the City and County Hos
j pital has incurred bills for the Institu
tion largely In excess of the appropria
; tion under the one-twelfth act, Audl
â  tor Baehr has withheld payment of de
j mands for January and February ag
; gregating J10.382 77. Baehr's atten
; tion was called to the fact that Flem
ing had addressed letters to the mer-
I chants whose bills had been held up
j that he saw no justification for' the
; action. Baehr says there was but
i $6420 39 available up to February 28
I to pay bills aggregating 510.382 77,
! an/1 while Fleming has allowed a prac
i tlcal overdraft, he. Baehr, will not per
! Mit the funds to be actually overdrawn
i in the treasury.
There is $7163 33 available for
March, April. May and June and
Baehr will continue to audit demands
up to that amount for each month.
! Fleming declares that he will effect a
j saving In these four months in order
i to pay the excess demands of January
I and February, but Baehr says that the
I actual saving must be effected before
1 he will audit the "held-up" demands.
I It is likely that these demands will
i not be paid until the end of the fiscal
i year unless the saving is made before
i that time.

for mercy in pathetic fashion, declar
ing that she already had been terribly
punished for her offense, Mrs. Mar
garet Robinson, a boarding-house
keeper, accused of stealing flowers
from a neighbor's yard, this morning
appeared before Justice Edgar and as
a result of her appeal for leniency the
charge against her was dismissed.
Mrs. Robinson already had lain for
five days in jail and declared to the
court that a mortgage upon her board
ingr-house had been foreclosed while
she was imprisoned, so that she came
to court stripped of all her belongings
and accused besides of an offense for
which she stood liable to punishment.
Mrs. Robinson had written a note to
Justice Edgar, begging for mercy, the
note reading as follows:
Judge Edgarâ Dear Sir: I, Maggie Robin
son, am going to ask you for mercy this day.
as I have no lawyer to defend nip nor money
to secure a defense. My creditors sold out
everything that belonged to me while I was in
Jail. 1 have nothing left but to go to work. I
think that r have been punished enoughâ so
many days In jail. MAOQIE ROBINSON.
Mrs. Robinson said that Allen How
ard of San Francisco had foreclosed a
mortgage of $4000 upon her belong
ings in the Oolonial, a fashionable
boarding-house on Dana street, which
she has conducted for eleven years.
She emerged from jail accordingly to
find herself penniless and without a
home. The Judge decided that ahe
had been sufficiently punished and per
mitted her to go free.
Mrs. Robinson was arrested ten days
ago while in the act of taking flowers
from the garden of Mrs. Margaret
Jones, a neighbor. There had been
many complaints of flowers and plants
stolen in the neighborhood and Deputy
Marshal Farrar was detailed to watch
for the culprit. The arrest of Mrs.

sued. As fully one-half of the mar
riage licenses issued by the County
Clerk here are for couples living in
San Francisco or other nearby coun

City Chemist H. D. Gibbs yesterday
filed a report with the Board of Health
covering the analysis of nine samples
of creme de menthe which were found
to contain coal tar dyes. In order to
Rive an idea of the amount of coal tar
dye present, Gibbs submitted two
pieces of cloth which were dyed In one
sample. One piece was dyed green
and the other blue. The following
brands were found to contain coal tar
dye:

found, although each sample was care
fully tested.
The board approved the report and
directed Health Officer Ragan to place
all creme de menthe corresponding to
the analysis under quarantine.
Dr. Harvey reported that 187 restau
rants have been inspected and 31 were
found to be in bad condition. Eleven

coloring of pinks and notices will
be sent to various dealers to cease
using the alleged poisonous dye.
The board appointed Lawrence

BOHEMIA SMILES AT

Matias Suspends While He Visits Europe
TELL OF NEEDS
FOR THE YEAR
The Finance Committee of the Board
of Supervisors listened yesterday to
estimates of various departments of
the city government of the amounts
needed by them for the next fiscal year.
The claims of the Board of Health, the
Election Commission, the Civil Service
Commission, the Coroner and the Jus
tices of the Peace were presented.
The Peace Justices claim that the
additional salary granted them at the
last session of the Legislature should
become due with the beginning of the
fiscal year. Supervisor Brandenstein
contended that as they were incum
bents the increase did not apply to
them. After some discussion the com
mittee decided to refer the matter to
the City Attorney.
Many innovations are proposed by
the Board of Health. It asks for four
medical inspectors, whose duty will be
to examine school children for skin
diseases. This custom. Dr. Ragan
maintains, is observed in nearly all the
large Eastern cities.
Four extra market inspectors, a
plumbing Inspector, two factory inspec
tors, two general nuisance inspectors
and eight extra laboratory assistants
ure also asked for. One of the most
immediate needs, Dr. Ragan declared,
was a night steward for the detention
ward at the Central Emergency Hos
pital. At present there is but one
steward on duty for the entire hos
pital at nights. When he is out on an
ambulance call the insane patients are
left practically unguarded. Besides
there is more work in the detention
ward than the matron can possibly
attend to.
The board recommended that the of
; fer of the Dundon Iron Works to equip
and care for the automobile sterilizer
for $250 a month be accepted. It is
; believed that this method of operating
1 the "bugkiller" would be the cheap
est. k
The Election Commissioners want 165
voting machines, which number, with
the forty now on hand, will be suffi
cient for all the precincts. The com
mittee expressed some hesitation as to
recommending the purchase, as it was
said the voting machines were being
improved continually and those avail
, able now might soon be out of date.
Commissioner Leffingwell recom
mended the copying of the assessment
roll and the preparing of a list of
â  Federal, State and municipal employes,
j In order that the board could protect
: itself from ineligible applicants for po
sitions as election officers. The com
mittee pronounced this scheme im
practicable and advised the board Ito
have applicants sworn.
Coroner Leland declared that Dr.
Ba< igalupi'i time was continually tak
! en up with police work and that the
1 Morgue needed a pathologist and toxi
cologist. The Civil Service Commis
sioners want $500 to remunerate ex

IHE SAX FRANCISCO CALL", FRIDAY, APRIL 21, 1905.
\ MATIAS 1 RESTAIT.AXT. FAVORITE
RESORT OF BOHEMIANS. WHOSE
PROPRIETOR IS RESTING.
The artist colony of Lower Mont
gomery street, the Latin Quarter, and
the true Bohemians of this city have
received a shock. Like a bolt from
the April sky it came, and as a result
the real Bohemian cult is looking for
a new dining-olace to make famous
by its presence, for there's a lock on
Matias' door! The little old Mexican
restaurant on Broadway, near Kearny,
which has for so long been a home to
all classes and nationalities, who met
there on a common footing, and where
the host would proudly open for in
spection his pricelesp volume of auto-a
graphs, original bits of musical com
position and artists' sketches, many
of vhlch were made by men of rec
ognized fame in the world of art, is
closed. The shabby portal is made se
cure, the dingy windows are barred,
and the tortilla, the enchilada and the
albondiga will cease their savory
odors, for Matiaa has gone.
With no more ado than when the
conventional being hangs on his of
fice door a sign, "Will be back in fif
teen minutes." the patron of Bohemia
has had placed entirely across the
front of his place a large sign bearing
the words, "Gone to Europe. Will be
back in six months." In the windows
are other notices, such as "Out on a
vacation," "Closed April 18, to open in
October." With an amusing abandon
ment of business cares the round-faced
Matias of Slavonia and the senosa his
â¢wife, from sunny Mexico, have shut
up shop for a half-year's rest In Eu
rope. Incidentally they furnish to
the busy American a unique example
in business methods.
WILL QUESTION
A LICENSE LAW
The law enacted by the California
Legislature at Its recent session to tax
every corporation doing business in
this State $10 a year for the privilege
Mill be contested. Already steps have
been taken to ascertain whether it is
valid. There are several sections In
the law. The first provides that "no
corporation heretofore or hereafter in
corporated under the e-iaws of this
State, or any other State, shall do, or
attempt to do, any business by virtue
of its charter or certificate of incor
poration in this State without a li
cense therefor."
The first step has been taken by the
Rowley Investment Company, which
has sent out a circular letter to all cor
porations- in this city asking them to
take part in making a test of the law
in question. Counsel has been re
tained and a vigorous fight is prom
ised. In a letter the Rowley Invest
ment Company makes the following
assertions:
W> consider the act a mere entering wedge,
which will ultimately place an unjust burden
opon corporations unless it be resisted. It
Is especiaily onerous on the small corporations.
However, as the amount of the tax is ex
ceedingly small it is impossible for any one
company to assume the burden of contesting
It. We are advised that the act Is lnvaJid,
and If wo can get the co-operation of othei
corporations sufficient to warrant it we pro
pose to employ the best legal assistance avail
able to contest the validity of the act In
the courts. As the tax will be payable In
a lew months and the act provides that the
charters of all corporations failing to pa>
It snail be forfeited you must act promptly
if you desire to aid up and obtain the benefit
of this contest. All that we RSk you to do
Is to sign the inclosed agreement to pay us
one-half of the first year's tax in case ws
are successful in having the tax held illegal.
We will pay all the costs and attorney's
fees and it will cost you nothing if we fall
and only one-half of the first yÂ«ar's tax it
we win.
This move has had the effect of
bringing a large number of firms al
ready in touch with the Rowley In
vestment Company that has assumed
the task of making the fight against
the corporation license measure in
court. The last section of the law is
as follows:
At the expiration of said sixty days from
the date of such proclamation (of the Gover
nor declaring that the provisions of the law
â¢will be enforced) the charters of all domestic
corporations who have not complied with thÂ»
provisions ot this act shall be forfeited to
the State of California; and all foreign cor
porations who have not complied with the pro
visions of this act and paid said tar shall
forfeit the right to do business In this State.

WEBER HEIRS
CLAIM TITLE
Assert That Miner Channel
Will Go to Them When the
Diverting Canal Is Dug
TAKE POSITIVE STAND
Say That Right of Way and
Not the Land Was Given
to the City of Stockton
Special Dispatch to The Call.
STOCKTOX. April 20.â When the di
verting canal is dug east of this city
Miner f'hanrel. which enters the city
or the east side and traverses it for
more than a mile, will become dry. The
heirs of Captain Weber, founder df
Stockton, claim that a large acreage
of land in the bed of the chan
nelâor slouch-will thereupon revert
to them. George A. Atherton, a civil
engineer familiar with the surveys, de
clares the same.
It seems that i.'aptain Webejr did not
deed the Miner Channel to the city at
the time it was improved in IS7B, but
simply gave the city a right of way
there for the stream. The city will
forfeit the right of way as soon as the
channel ceases to carry water, which
will be as soon as the diverting canal
is finished.
That not all of Miner Channel will
revert to ih^ Weber heirs is due to the
fact that they sold some of the prop
erty abuttine on the channel before the
waterway was improved. Nevertheless
property worth a fortune will revert
to the Weiiers as soon as the diverting
canal is carrying water.
CYCLONE TEARS
DOWN HOUSES
Special Dispatch to The Call.
FRESNO. April 20.â T0 the fact that
they had recently arrived from Kansas,
two families by the names of Cullom
and Whiteside owe theii* escape from
death at the hands of a cyclone-like
wind which swept over a section of
country four miles south of Visalia
Wednesday afternoon. The twister
raised a two-story house belonging to
F. M. Busby more than one hundred
feet in the air and dropped it on the top
of a huge oak tree. Fruit trees were
uprooted, fences were demolished and
even oak trees were twisted to the
ground. The two families residing in
the Busby house saved themselves only
by noting the danger in time and using
an irrigation ditch as a cyclone cellar.
Whiteside was some distance from
the house when he saw the funnel
shaped cloud approaching. Remember
ing his Kansas experiences he dashed
to the house and, routing out the wo
men and children, took refuge with
them in a near-by ditch. The children
lay flat on the ground with the grown
persons lying on top of them to hold
them down. All escaped injury, but
when they arose Jiot a vestige of the
farm buildings was to be seen.

STRANGE FIND
OF JUNKMEN
Trunk Bought by Them at
an uoldu old Horse" Sale Holds
Certificates of Deposit
UNCLAIMED FOE YEABS
Other Papers Show That the
Owner Was at One Time in
Dairy Business at La Honda
Social Dispatch to The Call.
SEATTLE. Wash., April 20. â When
Judd & Co., second-hand junk dealers,
opened a trunk purchased at an "old
horse" sale of the Pacific Coast Com
pany's unclaimed baggage to-day they
found it contained certificates of de
posit for $3725 in the name of Carlo
P. Bolonelli, who, judging from other
papers found, was a resident of Cali
fornia from 1890 to 1897.
The trunk came to the Pacific Coast
Company's warehouse about five years
ago as baggage from San Francisco,
but no record of Bolonelli as a pas
senger can be found.
Among the papers is a certificate of
membership in Laguna Lodge, I. O.
O. F.. of Guadalupe, Cal., with dues
paid until 1897. Other papers show
Bolonelli was engaged in the dairy
business with Antone Bassetti at La
Honda.
Two of the certificates show that on
June 19, 1897, Bolonelli deposited
$1500 with Tonini & Co., San Fran
cisco, and on various dates sums ag
gregating $2225 with J. F. Fugazi &
Co., San Francisco. For the latter
deposits he was given a certificate of
deposit on the Banca Cantonale Ticin
ese, Bellinzona, Switzerland, all bear
ing interest. There is also a deed
showing he purchased a stock ranch
from A. V. Kieffer of La Honda in
1892.
In another paper. Involving the sale
of a stock of goods for $240, is the
name of Mrs. Bolonelli.
LARGE REVENUE
FROM OYSTERS
Special Dispatch to The Call.
TACOMA, April 20.â State Fish Com
missioner Kershaw announces that the
State has suddenly come into a fine
revenue from the sale of seed oysters
taken from the State oyster reserve.
By recent legislation fifteen thousand
acres of valuable oyster lands on
Puget Sound and Willapa harbor are
placed in charge of the State Fish
Commissioner. Under the State regu
lation the owners of private oyster
lands can take seed from the State
beds by the payment of a license fee
between April 1 and June 15. The
rate for the seed is ten cents per sack
at Willapa harbor and twenty-five
cents per sack on Puget Sound. A sack
comprises one hundred and twenty
pounds. No person can take from thÂ«Â»
State reserve more than five hundred
sacks from each acre prepared for seed
ing. All moneys derived from these
sales shall be paid into the State oyster
fund for the development and main
tenance of State reserves. The State's
Income this year will probably reach
$25,000. and with good care of the beds
will increase rapidly hereafter.

THE PURPOSE OF THE LEAGUE.
A lamenting on the Republican Leaj^ie, ;
it is a capital mistake for the
irate ticket. Wo arc left in the dark
prhether by a a rot a separate league ticket for
de 1 r a separate ticket of candidates for city i
offices. \Â«i matter which is meant, it is not the purpose of the;
lea:: iry iÂ« co-operation with the Republican
ore rcise a defensive and cleansing influence upon its
action, il such be m This is a time for union and not for,
: not palling apart.
- d what i: will do, nor do we know its'
I rise organisation putting up a ticket at the
pou which the Horace and Carts and the Daughters of
Leech will unite to adulterate Republican action with
gjiait. In that event some heroic treatment will be necessary, but
â¢it believes that the organization will either betray
irty or be betrayed.
A dent of The Call has impeached the plan of the j
because he opposes a moVe to better the municipal govern- |
se he thinks a citizens' movement, inviting general
i the nay to reach that end. The Call, in its process
% plans down to a conclusion, discussed a citizens' movement j
c irresponsive to it. This left only a resort to ;
ptrty organizations by providing some methods to safe- j
action tad to rationalize it. In the Democratic organ!- ;
was no sign. The only appearance of activity was in the
an party. The committee of 250 formed, acted with energy
and determination, and evolved into the Republican League. This
movement now in action that is in touch with the desire
he people in both parties to secure decent municipal government.
present^ the reform forces of the city. To start another inde- j
pemient movement now means only a division of forces.
Every citizen sees his duty to be the upholding of the purposes
c. in perfect confidence that the result which will issue
- efforts will deserve the support of all voters who prefer de-
Cency to dirt in the local government. No man can fail to feel and
effect of ihe league's work upon the purposes of the Repub
lican party. It aims at a high mark, and the action of the County
nmittee seems to commit it to a policy that will be supported
a majority of the voters and taxpayers. The strength of the
league is testified to by the efforts of its opponents to disintegrate
and discredit it. Schemers do not waste their time fighting some
thing that is without strength, purpose and support.
The eye of every grafter in the city is upon the league. Its
en< â  c it will make mistakes, and if it do not they are entirely
capable of inventing mistakes for it that it has not made. It does
not intend to make the mistake of a separate ticket, different from
â¢ of the party organization of which it is a part. It has perfect
faith in its ability to co-operate with its party and secure a right re-
It is not composed of tyros and novitiates. It is controlled by
â  and experienced fighters of municipal corruption. It dreams
no ,-.iid has no illusions. It appreciates the hard work that
id. and the need of wisdom and watchfulness. If there be
any hope of reform outside of its scope and plan, where is it? Xo
man can say. Therefore it is no time to discuss plans that might
have been. Suffice it to say that they are not, and the league's plan
It will be worked to its logical conclusion in wisdom and up
rightness of purpose. There is no indication that the Republican
nmittee will fail to co-operate faithfully with it.
When all decent men admit the crying need" of municipal re
1 and cast about for ways and means to achieve it, and such a
body as the league appears, representative of the purpose of all de
cent men. if there be any reason why all such should not co-operate
with it let it be stated. Last year there was substantial co-operation
at the polls in this city in giving impulse to the policy of national
reform. Democrats and Republicans voted together for President
Â«evelt because he represented a purpose which they held in
common, not as party men. but as patriotic citizens. Now the city
government is the nearest to us all. It affects us directly. It is not
remote. If it be dirty we suffer. If it be wasteful we lose. If it in
jure the municipal reputation we all suffer in our reputation. Why.
therefore, should we not stand together, back of the only organiza
that has shown a disposition and desire to bear the brunt of
the fight that must be made ? 9
The league is not going to make any capital mistakes. It is not
going to chase rainbows. It is not going to make nasty alliances. It
.roing to quit, for it is not composed of quitters. In short, it
is not going to do any of the things prepared and predicted for it by
- nemies. the prophets, seers and revelators of graft. It uses the
organized political party that has a majority in this city as the in
ment of reform, and in this we think it does wisely and that it
deserve? the grand support it is bound to receive.
THE SMALL LANDHOLDER.
THE dealers in farm implements and machinery begin to notice
the advent of the small landholder. *The great machine which
cuts and threshes small grain at one operation came into use
to meet the necessities of large landholdings. We boasted with pride
of our fifty thousand acre wheat fields, and when the grain had stood
until dead ripe and dry these great machines followed each other,
cutting swaths miles in length, and looking like ships sailing on a
yellow sea. Now our coming boast will be the small farmer and the
imall field.
The machinery dealers notice a growing demand for the self
binding harvester. The grain is being cut before it is ready to shell,
and while there is yet sap in the straw. It is bound in sheaves
shocked in the field and allowed to "sweat." Perhaps this will improve
its gluten content. There is no doubt that it wiil furnish a straw that
has fodder value, and will carry stock over from one green season
to another. When the wheat stands, dead ripe and dry, waiting for
the big machine to head and thresh, the wind shells an average of
five bushels per acre, and the use of the straw is lost. The big
machine, however, has cut and threshed it for $1 75 per acre, while
the cutting by a self-binder cost $2 50. The small farmer, in many
instances bringing his Eastern experience with him, now sees that
he saves more than the difference in grain and straw.
The passing of the fifty thousand acre wheat field is in process.
It was in its day the biggest thing of the kind on earth. It had its
place in the progress of the State, and we were proud of it. Rut it
nto history among the other great things that featured our sev
eral steps forward. It will have its own record and chapter, like the
Fall of gold picked in a day out of the placers of the auriferous
or rivers. The self-binder follows it, rattling off notice to
a! 1 that the small farmer has arrived, and the future of agricultural
California 5s to be wrought out on his little farm well tilled. His
bank account will soon sprout and grow in our country banks, and
he will Bit under his own vine and fig tree and electric light and
telephone, raise his own pigs, chickens and turkeys, garden vegetables
and truck, and bless the day he settled in California.

O sweet is praise! And sweet to be
admired:
But to be loved is sweeter! Victims

With garlands, and the music of a
feast
May please a groddess, but a woman
craves
Quiet, and little children round her
kneefc"
SINGS Thomas Ashe, depicting
Psyche grieving because she was so
splendid that no man dared to love
her; but, instead, fell down to wor
ship, and, having worshiped, turned
away.
And I, a little cricket in the grass,
listening to this birdsong of the poet,
and trying in my humble way to tell
the longings of a woman's soul, would
have you hearken to a similar strain,
and believe that love is woman's great
est right, and motherhood her greatest
privilege.
Perhaps I narrow the mission of wo
man when I regard her as a priestess
in nature's temple, to whom Is given
the task qt keeping the spirit of child
hood alive in the world, and of hand
ing down from generation to genera
tion the humbler virtues and the simp
ler faith.
But a narrow destiny may be a happy
destiny, on the same principle that it
is the small room which is the cozy
room; both hold elements of home.
And It takes great genius to make a
wide destiny beautiful; just as it takes
extraordinary skill to make a largo
room habitable for every day.
The world needs happiness, and the
world needs homes. In his book of es
says called "The Blue Flower," Henry
Van Dyke Identifies the search for hap
piness with human life. And it is in
the home that the tired heart of man
finds rest after weariness, and strength
after struggle.
I do not, therefore, accept the view
that it *s greater for a woman to be
an Individual than to be wife and
mother. For wifehood and motherhood
form woman's ordered destiny. Cer
tainly we are first of all immortal souls,
but. at the same time we have, as Rus
kln says, an instinct for our real duties.
And the minute that we set up as an
idol our soul, our individuality â or
whatever else we choose to call the un
FRESH FROM THE SPRING JOKE FACTORY
IN POLITICS.
The Congressman â Can you
recommend me to a good po

The Senatorâ Political carpen
ter! What do you want done?
The Congressman â I want him
to nail some campaign lies.
â New Tnrk HÂ»rald
dying part of usâ we hinder its evolu
tion, by force of that principle con
tained in the written words: "He that
findeth his life shall lose it."
Motherhood and wifehood grow no
bler as womanhood grows finer; and
by the same law, womanhood becomes
nobler as motherhood and wifehood
grow in grace.
Without question it is sweet to be
praised and sweet to be admired. Adu
lation and incense please the vanity of
a woman even more than if she were a
goddess.. It is pleasant to be feasted
and toasted, and to have certain ex
clusive doors opened to you because
you are you and no other.
But, after all, these are hollow joys
in those lonely hours w-hen the great
mystery of things presses closely upon
you, and you ask your woman heart
those old perplexing questions, "Why
why am I here? Whence came I?
Whither do I go?"
Then you are glad that home is all
about you, that little children press
about your knees, and that, through
earthly love, you fathom the grand,
deep silence of the love supreme.
BEST OP ALL PLAYS.
I do not care for problem plays; give
me the kind of play
In which the girl fs just as pure as
are the flowers in May;
The play in which in time of need the
hero's right on deck,
And where the scheming villain gets it
always in the neck.
I love to hear the girl refuse the vil
lain's gold to take.
And say that rags are royal duds when
worn for virtue's sake;
I love to see her beaux decline to heed
the rich man's beck,
And swat the villain with a club ath
wart his ugly neck.
O not for me the Gallic farce, the Ib-
sen fol-de-rol.
Where man is but a Jackanapes and
woman is a doll;
I'll take the sturdy plot In which the
villain tries to wreck
The hero's life, and in the end Just gets
it in the neck.

THE BURGLAR
AND THE LADY
MISS ETHEL VAGE was a
I I pleasant and rather pretty girl,
who -had seen, as she had come
. to ; think.", her best days. She ' lived
with her father and mother, and there
were three younger brothers. These
last, perhaps, accounted for the fact
that she had sc
little t attention
from | men. Young
er brothers are i al
most always dis
couraging: to suit
ors. â¢/ â Â. . â¢ - - â -â .â ;^
The Blivages
lived in a cheerful
and commodious
flat and : enjoyed
i all the advantages
of a fixed and suf
â¢ ficient income. The
boy were in
school, except ' the
eldest, who was a
freshman in - the
university. They
were away nearly
all day and Ethei
filled up her time
by a great' deal of
charitable and
philanthropic
workâ that' refuge
of women who
have ceased to ex
pect f much from
men.
Mr. 811 v a c
came home i from
work very tired In
the evening:. He
was - the head
bookkeeper In a
big . d o w nt o wn
concern and suf
fered ; from deaf
ness to an extent
that made him a
great ,deal of a re
cluse. Mrs. Bllv
age, self-sacrificing
as so many wives
are in similar cir
cumstances, stayed
at home with him.
The whole fam
ily was in the
habit of going to
bed early and get
ting up betimes in
the morning, and
it was a compara
tively easy matter
for Ethel to fill in
her short evenings
with instructive
reading and useful
sewing and mend
ing. B^^^^^^^^^
Billy, the brother In college, had
fallen into the habit of saying that
all Ethel needed was to have some
man kiss her. and she would wake up.
As a matter of fact, she had had al
most no attention from men in gen
eral, and none at all from any man
in particular. She did not miss what
she had never had so far as she was
conscious of it, but she had settled
herself in her own mind as a maiden
Who was never going to be kissed, and
she did not feel any deprivation on
that account. Her brother's observa
tion, however often repeated, she took
with the" good natured tolerance al
most any girl has to acquire if she
lives with three brothers who are fond
of teasing.
One night when Mr. Blivagehad to
work late on his books, he sent home
tickets for the entire family to go to
the theater. But Ethel had to keep an

THE DAY FOR EVICTION.
(An Actual Scene In New York When
a Poor Family Was About to
Be Dispossessed.)
We iurned now into Eldridge street
and drove slowly through lines of
peddlers' carts until we came to a bar
ber's pole in front of a narrow door
way. A black-haired woman peered at
us curiously from a window over red
and blue announcements, in Yiddish, of
various balls in the neighborhood.
This was No. 169, the home of Abr&m
Rabinovitch, whom we presently found
in two rooms of the rear tenement,
rooms that were clean and neat, despite
their poverty, and that showed a
woman's effort to make them bright
and homelike.
The woman lay on a bed in the back
room in a sort of stupor. It was partly
the heat, for the place was stifling and
the windows tight shut, but it was
partly want of food, as we realized
when she murmured "milkâ hunger."
She was not over twenty-three, and,
as she lay there pale and still, she
looked quite beautiful.
The husband'! grief was pitiful.
When the baby came, he said, seven
days before, there was no money and
no food. For three days he had given
his wife tea, nothing else, he had noth
ing else. Then a visitor left him fifty
cents and he bought her a chicken.
For himself he bought some stale
bread, and for little Israel, one year
old (he was holding Israel in his arms),
he bought stale bread also. He would
not have us think ill of himâ would we
come away from the door lest the
neighbors Hear. He had never told
any one of their destitution, he had his

MISS CALHOUN'S
RAMONA IS VERY
HIGHLY PRAISED
TALENTED ACTRESS. WHOSE
CLEVER PRODUCTION OF "RA-
BtOWA." U MT'CH APPRECIATED.
The romantic drama. "Ramona,"
which Is now being played at the Grand
Opera House by Miss Virginia ('al
houn, is the subject of much favorable
comment. Miss Mary Austin, the well
known writer and the author of "Land
of Little Rain" and "Ysidro." speaks
highly of Miss Calhoun's dramatization
of Helen Hunt Jackson's book.
Attorney John Jury, who in addition
to his work as a lawyer, is known as a
poet of high merit, also commends Miss
Calhoun's dramatization. Miss Austin
writes:
On first seeing Miss Calhoun's Ramona one
must give room to generous eurprise to find
that a book so incoherent, one in which actu
ality and art are so often sacrificed to phil
anthropy, could be pulled Into dramatic unity.
To this succeeds the conviction that Mire
CaJhoun has produced .1 truer type of the
mixed breed than Mrs. Jackson dared attempt
truer i:, fact to the flow and balance of the
mixed strains than any portrayal of it in
HUrature. I should say that in the- fifth
act she touches the highest note of verity
in the return of Ramona to the normal plane
of loving and being loved. Mrs. Jackson,
you recall, represents her as spent and sobered,
accepting Felipe from an at^jmir.abie sense of
duty, which does not. to my knowledge, in
here in the type. That little touch of pos
sible jealousy In the fifth act Is evidence that
Miss Calhoun grasps the essential capacity
of the primitive soul to renew the emotional
situation with freshness and vitality ar.j
marks the artistic climax of her characterize
lion.
Next after Ramona of course Interest cen
ter* in the role of AUessandro. .Ceitalnly Mr.
Griffith in the part of Allessandro has a real
problem, attempting: as he must, to convey
an impression of human passion through the
unfamiliar medium of Indian behavior. It is
fair to say that half the difficulties of the In
terpretation would be removed If audiences
knew more about Indians as they really are,
for It Is evident that all his variations from
strictest verities are concessions to dramatic
necessities.
Af a whole the play is nr, table in being the
first and remarkably successful attempt to
portray the Indian and the mixed breed from
the Intimate and personal point of view.
MARY AUSTIN.
Mr. Jury states his opinions of the
work as follows:
Californians are a* a rul? intensely loyal tc
thÂ«lr own Btate That loyalty, however, runs
too much to climate. We are proud of our
summer days in December, of our May days in
August, of our Men grain fields, of our bounti
ful orchards, of our wonderfully productive
vineyards. Tourists are met by the omnipres
ent real fcstate agent and as a const-quence
only the commercial side of natures favor and
bounty le emphasized. Seldom do we turn
aside from business long enough to dream of
the romantic days through which our State has
passed, to read of the mission fathers and
their simple, sacrificing lives, of the Indians
of former days, persecuted, yet bray*. natural,
philosophical.
Helen Hunt Jackson attempted to do for the
Indian what Harriet Beecher Stowe did for
the slave of the South. The American people
fought the greatest and most awful war that
has ever been fought that the. judgment of the
North in reference to slavery might be sus
tained. The same people have remained cal
lous and indifferent to the cruelty practiced
upon the red man. The story of Ramona. now
being presented nightly at the Grand Opera
house. Is one of, deep naturalness, tender affec
tion, of purity and loyalty in love, of devotion
and Of Borrow. Miss Virginia Calhoun in her
dramatisation of Mrs. Jackson's work has dis
played high art and a clear purpose. The
play is permeated with the atmosphere of the
open plains and the lofty mountains. And
Ramona, that sweet flower of the days "be
fore the Gringo came." Is as beautifully nat
ural as thÂ« golden poppy that brightens the
lone slopes of San Jacinto. I cannot refrain
from enjoining those whose hearts are yearn
ing for something from the stage that reflect*
the soul of early .California to hear Virginia
Calhoun . In "Ramona." Here is a child of
California . In a California play of her own
dramatization ;on a California subject. If a
mere layman might be permitted to inter a
prophecy I i would Â»ay that . thÂ« East and Eu
rope, If this . play Is ever presented In those
far away places, will be stirred Ito their very
depths* not only with the romance of thin
etory. but with the inexpressible charm that Is
reflected In the warmth â  of color, newness of
melody and quaintness of scenes that distin
guish It. All honor and I encouragement to
this little woman, whose dramatic work, both
as writer and actress. Is as purely Callfornlan
throughout as the scenes and situations that
Inspired Helen Hunt Jackson to write the story
of the crimes committed upon the red man in
the name of â¢ civilisation. JOHN' G. JURY.
PaÂ«*oÂ«Â» Fictitious Cheeks.
John Stack, a clerk In a store at 54
Eighth street, obtained a warrant
from Police Judjfe Fritz yesterday for
the arreat of A. S. Thomson on a
charge of passing a fictitious check.
The check was for $2 and was signed
"G. H. Tay & Co." Francis Baker,
president of the Oeorge H. Tay Com
pany, accompanied Stack to the bond
and warrant clerk's office and said
that a number of checks had been
passed, apparently by the same per
son, bearing the same signature,
which led people to believe that they
were signed by his company. Forg
ery could not be charged because It
was not the signature of the company.
President Baker said he was anxious
to find the check passer and have him
punished.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL. FRIDAY. APRIL 21. 1005
ATTORNEY USES
FISTS IN COURT
William A. Schooler Lands
Swing on the Nose of Mari
ner Samuel A. Kidstou
BOTH OKDERED TO JAIL
Judge Sloss Takes Belliger
ents to Task and Vindicates
the Dignity of the Bench
Samuel A. Kidston, chief officer of
the transport Sherman, is in jail for
contempt of court and Attorney Wil
liam A. Schooler will be assigned an
adjoining apartment in the county bas
tile to-day for the same offense. Kid
ston's term will expire shortly after
Schooler's begins and with the re
lease of the last named to-morrow the
dignity of the Superior bench of San
Francisco will be vindicated.
Schooler was engaged In oratorically
flaying Kidston in Judge Sloss' court
yesterday morning when the army
transport man called him a liar. An
instant later Schoolei landed a right
swing on the mariner's nose and the
courtroom was in an uproar. "I can
wipe the floor with him," shouted Kid
ston, leaping to his feet and starting
tower d the attorney, but Bailiff Con
nelly and Attorney Barry grappled
with him and forced him into a seat.
"I'm guilty," was all Schooler had
to say when brought before the bar
of the court. "This man called me a
liar and I resented it." The attorney,
contrary to the usual rule, had no apol
ogy to offer to the court and Kidston
wag too astonished at the assault to
make a protest or offer a word in miti
gation of his act. The result was that
Judge Sloss decided the case was one
for imprisonment, not fine, "and ordered
both belligerents into custody for
twenty-four hours.
SCHOOLER SECURES STAY.
Schooler said that if the sentence
were immediately carried into execu
tion his business would suffer, but
promised the court that if a stay of
one day was granted he would not ap
ply for a writ of habeas corpus, but
would appear this morning to serve his
sentence. Judge Sloss granted him the
stay.
The fight was the outcome of the suit
instituted by Kidstan's wife for main
tenance. Kidston was to appear in
court yesterday morning to show
cause why he should not pay his wife
|80 forthwith, but prior to the opening
of court he met Mrs. Kidston, paid her
the money and, it is claimed, she in
formed Schooler af the fact and direct
ed him to dismiss the suit.
When the case was called Kidston
was in court, with his attorney, but
Mrs. Kidston did not appear. As soon
as the case was called Schooler said
nothing about dismissal, but lit into
Kidston. saying: "This man owes his
wife $80 for maintenance and he has
stated that he intends leaving the
country, never to return, to avoid pay
ing this small sum."
"It's "a lie," said Kidston loud
enough for Schooler to hear.
"Did you mean that?" said Schooler,
walking over to the mariner.
"Yes, I did," answered Kidston.
Then Schooler landed on the chief of
ficer's nose and both were ordered to
pay the penalty.
MILS. KIDSTOX ARRIVES.
About an hour after the. scene in
f. â urt Mrs. Kidston rushed to Judge
Sloan* chambers and pleaded with the
court to order the release of her hus
band. "Attorney Schooler," she said,
"had no right to attack him, as I told
Mr. Schooler to dismiss the suit."
But Judge Sloss refused to set aside
his order and Mrs. Kidston hunted up
her husband, who was in the Sheriff's
office in custody of the bailiff. Mrs.
Kidston was overcome when she saw
her husband a prisoner and broke into
tears. For a couple engaged In litiga
tion they were unusually affectionate
toward each other.
"They don't act like a couple that's
fighting." said the .deputy, and then he
walked over and told Kidston that it
was time they were on their way to
Jail. Mrs. Kidston was still in tears
when the prisoner was placed for safe
keeping for a day in the hands of the
county turnkey.

Charles Warren Stoddard Recalls Boyhood
Memories of the Old Sanctuary.
LAURA BRIDE POWERS
"Beautiful old Mission Dolores!" said
Charles Warren Stoddard yesterday as
he stood at the altar-rail of the sanc
tuary. "It's just fifty years since I
knelt in this sacred spot. How well
how well I recall it all now. But alas!
what changes have come since then,
when as a lad I wandered in here to
pray."
With moist eyes the well-beloved
writer lingered long in the chapel to as
sist in the service of Holy Thursday â
a service that for 128 years has never
suffered interruption upon this day.
That's a pretty long time as we Amer
icans reckon time.
Yesterday throngs of people visited
the old church, remained a while in
meditation or prayer, and then went
their way better and happier for hav
ing visited this most hallowed spot of
all San Francisco. The services of the
day were simple.
At the conclusion of the mass in the
new church a procession waa formed
by the officiating priests and the Holy
Eucharist was borne Into the Mission
church under a cajtiopy of white silk
and gold.
Walking ahead were 200 little girls
In white frocks, veils and wreaths,
strewing rose leaves as they walked.
The sacrament was then exposed for
adoration upon the old altar, enshrined
in a maze of lilies and roses.
Upon the altar were four great brass
candlesticks that have come down to
us from the days of Junipero Serra â
also a beautiful gold monstrance
brought by the great Franciscan from
Mexico in 1776.
During the day hundreds of people
who love the old Mission for tlie mem
ories it holds came to pay their re
spects to the mother-church of the
city, and on every hand were hopes
expressed that from now on the doors
of the Mission shall not be closed to
the public.
It is believed that the pastor will ac
cede to the unanimous wish of San
Francisco when he is formally request
ed to do so by the Landmarks League,
fur ihe Mission is the well-beloved
heritage of the city.

Want Fodder in Philippine.
The Pacific Commercial Museum's
Manila agent writes that the Insular
Department has Inquired for Califor
nia compressed fodder in 112-pound
bales, to be shipped in fifty-ton lots
every two months. The fodder to be
composed of chopped oat hay, seventy
two pounds; choped oats, twenty-eight
pounds; bran, twelve pounds; bales to
have two bands, board ends and bur
laped. This class of fodder is being
supplied at present mostly from Aus
tralia, and, as a big demand for it
pxisis, this should prove an oppor
tunity for California shippers. In
quiries have also been made for cement
in barrels, with special packing to
avoid the effects of the humidity of
tropical atmospheres.

LATTR OX, MEETTVG COLLEGE AST* OTirER TEAMS IN MATt'H (JAMES.
The latest addition to San Francis
co's varied assortment of sporting
layouts is the champion baseball team
from the university of "Waseda of Ja
pan. Fifteen of the brightest stars
from the green diamond of the Mikado
tripped merrily down the gangplank of
the Manchuria when sh* docked yes
terday in this city. Five hours after
their arrival the little brown tossers
occupied a front row of Recreation
park grandstand viewinp the first big
leapue game they ever say..
These brawny young athletes trav
eled those thousands of miles from the
realm of far Nippon just for the pleas
ure of matching. their skill against the
best teams the American colleges can
pit against them. They are all titled
young men and come here for the
pleasure of lining out base hits and
catching flies only. They will also
study the methods in vogue here and
pay special attention to the manner
In which the great national pastime Is
played by the big leaguers.
The TVaseda ball team is as compact
and as sturdy looking an aggregation
cf athletes as ever graced these shores.
The men are far above the average
Japanese in height and are possessed
of more good looks than falls to the
lot of the ordinary Jap. If they look
half as srocd on the diamond as they
do in citizens' clothes, they will surely
make the " American collegians play
*come to beat them.
This bunch of brown ball tossers are
just spoiling for a game of ball. They
want to play so badly that they are
going down to Stanford this morning
in order to cross bats with the Cardinal
nine in the afternoon. They are con
fident of victory- though they are not
given to exploiting their prowess in
loud tones.
The team will remain at Stanford
for a wt-'-k and will probably play a
there. It will then in
vade the Berkeley campus and will, in
all probability, indulge in a nerieÂ« wrth
the Blue and Gold nine. The brown
will then make their way Eaet.
meeting all the leading college nines
in the country throughout the spring
and summer.
The t*am Is made up of the follow
ing playere: Isso Abe. manager: Ky
nehin Haslieda, Kiyaehi Oshikawa.
Thusuke Tachihara, T'taka Sucuki, Al

Any fan who watched them at the
Eighth street lot yesterday could see
thai. Their quick eyes caught every
fine play and they commented amonsr
themselvws; they stood up and rooted
wtienev*| a p:ood catch or hit was
made. In fact, they showed all the
earmarks of true American fans.
On the same steamer was Professor
8. Takaort who comes here under con
tract to the United States Government
to teach jiu jitsu at West Point and
Annapolis. He is a leading exponent
of the game in the land of the Mikado
and will impart his knowledge of the

Seals Swing Hard
And Get Only
One Run.
Floaters stood in the way of the
Seals and victory yesterday afternoon
at Recreation Park. The original brand
which is handled by Ham Iberg exclu
sively was dealt out with regularity
throughout the game. Uncle's gang
were swinging their heads off, but
their efforts did no good. They were
iucky to get a run. Score, Oakland 3,
San Francisco '
When Ham is right and his floaters
float ac they should, nobody's ball
team has a license to win against him.
The conditions yesterday seemed to
suit Ham to perfection. He had that
old balloon ball of his working for a
fair ye well. Waldron's hit in the fifth
inning was the only bingle counted
against the deliberate siabster.
Although it was raining throughout
the game, the umpire said never a
word about calling it and the fans
seemed content to sit around and
watch the home team get walloped.
The fielding on both sides was fast.
Oakland did some creditable work
with the willow, especially when men
were on the bases.
Wheeler did not have a thing that could
puzzle the Commuters, It was lucky
for him they did not come through with
a score about twice the size. He was
hit hard in every inning, but many of
the drives went direct to fielders, thua
cutting off many base hits and pre
venting a bunch of runs.
Uncle had Marty Murphy to guard
the first sack for him. ; Marty played a
good game, taking care of his fifteen
chances ' without an error. Wilson
played behind : the bat, so the rest of
the team remained unchanged. The
line up looked better yesterday than
It has for some days.
Kelly played a swell game of ball at
the second sack, taking all of his twelve
chances without the slightest miscue.
His second timely hit in two days
made him the candy with the fans.
He was : given the big welcome shout
every . time he came up. Byrnes did
some fast pegging to second, not a
Seal stealing on him. The score: .

One Tally To
the Good.
PORTLAND, April 20.â Foxy old
Van Buren took advantage of two
wild throws and two fierce juggles and
came home with the first run for Port
land to-day in the eighth. Dillon
thought Van led a little too far off
second when he was advanced by a
bunt and threw to Flood. Flood jug
gled and then threw wild In trying to
catch the runner at third. The Angels
tied the score in the ninth. Brashear
and Bernard were down when Flood
slid a two-bagger to center. Smith ad
vanced the ex-captain to third on a
single and he scored on Dillon's Texas
leaguer back of first. Flood Juggled a
warm one in the ninth with two men
on bases, and the runner at third came
home with the score^ that counted. The

FIGHT TICKETS
ARE ORDERED
Manager Jim Coffroth Sees
Way Clear to Promote
the Britt -White Affair
WELCH IS WON OVER
Well Known Keferee Suc
ceeds in Getting Super
visor Bent Again in Line
Manager Jim Coffroth was so sure he
had overcome all barriers yesterday
and that he was in a position to pro
mote the Britt- White fight that he or
dered the presses started on the tickets
and posters and on all the advertising
matter for the affair.
If he carried out his plans the town
will be placarded to-day with the an
nouncements which have been so long
overdue. No change has been made in
the date, the intention being to h.jid it
next Tuesday night in Mechanics" Pa
vilion.
Coffroth has been working: iii a new
direction since last Mondays meeting
of the Supervisors. He has endeavored
to secure the signatures of ten mem
bers of the board to an order granting
the permit. During iho evening he
claimed to have seven names on the
paper. Early yesterdny morning he
had been promised that the name of
Supervisor Bent would again appear in
his list.
He figures that wiih this and the
name of Lunstedt, who was out oÂ£
town, he would have nine. Supervisor
Rea has said he would vote with Cof
froth when he could show nine men in
favor of granting him the permit. He
was counted on to make the tenth man.
After Monday's meeting all Coffroth's
energies were exerted on Supervisor
Bent. Jack Welch and his brother
Dick, who are friendly with Bent, were
first won over. There was a long con
fab at an early hour yesterday morn
ing, which finally ended in a favorable
message being carried by Jack Welch
to Bent and Dick Welch, who were not
far away awaiting the outcome cf the
conference. Whether Jack Welch is to
referee the fight will develop within a
short time.
There is so much pressure being
brought to bear on the Supervisors that
Coffroth will not be sure his troubles
are ended until the fight is a thing of
the past.
Morris Levy submitted to the Super
visors' Police Committee yesterday an
amendment to the ordinance regulating
amateur boxing contests providing
for the appointment of a commit
tee of reputable citizens to su
pervise such exhibitions. The Po
lice Committee did not meet owing
the absence of Supervisors Boxton
and McClellan, but some action will
probably be taken next Monday. Levy
has on his list for the proposed com
mittee John D. Spreckels, M. H. de
Young, W. Greer Harrison and others.
UPHOLDS GRAND JURY.
Governing Body of Amateur Sport In
dorses Crusade Against Boxers.
At a meeting of the Pacific Athletic
Association held last evening- the mat
ter of refusing fight permits to vari
ous clubs about the city was discussed
and before an adjournment was taken
the following resolution was intro
duced and adopted:
Whereas, The Grand Jury of the
city and county of San Francisco has
taken action in regard to the so-called
amateur prize fights, and
Whereas, The Pacific Athletic As
sociation has opposed the granting of
permits by the Board of Supervisors
to said organizations for the last year
or more and believing that said clubs
are not organized for the benefit of
amateur athletics but for the pecun
iary gain of a few fight promoters,
therefore, bÂ« it
Resolved, That the Pacific Athletic
Association heartily indorses the ac
tion of the Grand Jury in its efforts
to eradicate this evil, and be it fur
ther
Resolved. That this association of
fer its services to said Grand Jury and
assist it in the interest of clean ama
teur sport.

LONG SHOTS ARE PROMINENT AT OAKLAND TRACK
Startling Reversal Dis
played by Abe .
Meyer.
Gloomy Gus Grabs
a Handout at
Juicy Odds.
FRED E. MULHOLLAND
About all the favorite players re
ceived at Oakland yesterday were
maltese double and right crosses for
gallantly and tenacity of purpose ex
hibited on the field of action.
In other words, the public choices
got what Paddy shot at, barrine Briar
thorpe, a successful short-Driced one
in the last. Surprise parties were af
forded by GloomyÂ»Gus, Olympian. Abe
Meyer and Royalty. The weather was
threatening and there was a fair at
tendance.
Not many days ago Billy Magrane
sold Gloomy Gus. In the openlne event
yesterday the three-year-old won first
time out for his new owner at odds of
25 to 1.
GOOOMY GUS A WINNER.
Knapp rode the favorite. SDondoolix.
and failed to crowd in amone the first
three. McClees put up a strone finish
on Gloomy Gus. beating Angelica a
head. Joe Kelly ran third.
Knapp alÃo piloted Revolt, favorite
for the six-furlong selling affair with
the weights raised twelve pounds above
the scale. His mount again ran un
placed. The winner turned ud in Olym
pian. a 6 to 1 chance, superbly handled
by Travers, which earned a neck de
cision over Funnyside. a 20 to 1 shot..
Toto Gratiot lost the place by a nose.
On recent performances the result of
the two-year-old dash at half a mile
looked to lie between Grasscutter and
Cbantilly. Each closed at odds of 9 to
5. Tooman got away well with Grass
cutter and looked a winner to the pad
dock, when "Handriding" Kelly, asrride
Abe Meyer, a 20 to 1 shot, came skim
ming along, winning easily in :48 fiat.
Bell, on El Dinero, rode a poor race,
finishing third.
ANVILS RUNAWAY RACE.
Anvil, one of the second choices,
made a runaway race of the mile and
twenty yards run, decided under selling
conditions. He again had Lloyd Foun
tain in the saddle and, in a driving fin
ish, received a neck decision over Edge
cliff. The 11 to 5 favorite, Sincerity
Belle, took show honors.
An extensive plunge on Dod Ander
son to win the mile selling fixture
caused the odds about Possart to
lengthen from 9 to 10 to 7 to 5. Roy
alty, a 9 to 1 chance, with Earnshaw
up, upset matters by early assuming
the lead and at the wire, finishing
more than a length ahead of Possart.
Dod Anderson ran third.
Charley Bell toc-k the concluding mile
purse with the 2 to 1 choice, Briar
thorpe. The black gelding possessed
all cplors of speed, running home four
lengths in advance of Ralph Young and
Forest King.
TRACK NOTES.
The stable of Fred Baird has been
restored to. good standing.
Unfortunately for John Bullman
several horses have shown such
marked improvement under other
riders that the judges notified him yes
terday to accept no further mounts
at Oakland.
G. A. Wnhlgreen. secretary of the
Denver-Overland Racing Club, Is here
in the interests of his association.
Vast improvements in the way of a
new betting ring and paddock have
been made at Overland Park, and he
predicts a great meeting at the Colo
rado metropolis in June.

134 Geary St.. S. F., C*LLINER KOREA BRINGS OVER A THOUSAND
PASSENGERS FROM THE FAR EAST.
CAPTAIN SEABURY TAKES BIG STEAMSHIP TO HER BERTH IN DASHING STYLI
Heavily freighted . with the products
ot the Far East and carrying more
than 1000 passengers, the Pacific Mail
fc-teamship Company's liner Korea.
captain Seabury. arrived early yester
cay morning from the Orient. She
anchored in quarantine nearly two
hours before .sunrise, having made the
run from Honolulu in five days and
twelve hours. By sunrise all "depart
ments of the floating hotel were ready
for the Federal inspection to which
all vessels from foreign ports must
Eubmit. The quarantine doctors got
through their work quickly, and as
the yellow flag came down the Korea's
anchor came np. The work of taking
up declarations was finished in mar
veiously short time, and before S
o clock Captain Seabury had his big
charge made fast alongside the wharf.
Ccptain Sea- is in a class by him
self when it comes to handling a
steamer, but he never did a prettier
piece of work in his half-century of
sailoring than yesterday, when he took
the Korea into her berth as quickly
and easily as if she had been running
on a railroad track. There was a
strong ebb tide running, and under
similar circumstances it is not unusual
for a Pacific Mail liner to spend sev
eral hours and the energy of one or
more tugs in setting alongside. Cap
tain Seabury, who has rare judgment
and the nerve to back it up, made the
tide help him. and not a line was put
out until the liner was in her berth.
Captain Seabury has been granted
leave of absence until next October,
and in a few days he is going away,
he say?, as far from sea and ships as
the railroad train will carry him. Al
though not 111. he needs a rest, and
is going to take it in the country. This
:* Captain Seahury's first real vaca
tion since he Joined the Pacific Mail
Company nearly forty years ago. H
cam* here in ISTS as first mate of the
Granada, commanded by his uncle.
The following year he was promoted
and given command of the Arizona,
and *rrer since then he has been sail
ing in and out of this harbor. His repu
tation is world wide, and no better
eailonnan or more dignified gentleman
ever ruled from the bridge of an Amer
ican merchantman. His subordinates
worship him and even his enemies re
spect him.
The voyage ended yesterday was thÂ«
Kcrea's thirteenth, but in spite of the
hoodoo and numerous Friday sailings
there was nothing specially unlucky
about the trip. Captain James Sim
monds, a Shanghai pilot, died on board
of apoplexy, and James Green, an old
man. a resident of Kobe, ale" died on
beard. Both Simmor.ds and Green
were in such i>oor health, however,
that not the most superstitious sailor
en the Korea tried to connect their
deaths with the fact that the liner was
making her thirteenth voyage.
Corr.okusa Horkassa, a Japanese
steerage passenger, engaged 'in a
gambling jraree with a Chinese fellow
traveler. The Chinaman won $3 of the
brov.n man's money, and the Nippon
fse prcved a poor loser. He was locked
â¢up in an improvised brig yesterday
v.hen the Korea arrived. He had at
tacked the yellow winner of his money
cni taken SSO of the Chinaman's *old
in addition to the $3 which had passed
to thÂ» pigtail gambler during the card
fame.
The Korea brought 205 cabin passen
gers. 124 Chir.ere; 10 Japanese from
Japan and Ges from Honolulu. She
brought sf^3 tons cf cargo, which in
cluded 11G2 bales of silk, 700 chests of
tra and 7000 mats of rice. The passen
gers included the following:

MUST REMOVE
UNUSED WIRES
Electric Liofht Companies
Are in Danger of Losing
Privileges on Water Front
CAUSE OF TWO FIRES
Cost of Repairs to the Tug
Governor Irwin Excites
Comment in the Board
The electric light companies hava
been notified several times that the
dead wires and tottering poles along
the water front must be removed, but
no attention whatever has been given
to the notices. Yesterday the State
Board of Harbor Commissioners
adopted a resolution that all privileges
on the front accorded to the lisht com
panies would be revoked at the expira
tion of ten days if the unused poles
and wires were not then removed.
In discussing the topic yesterday
Commissioners Spear and Crocker de
cided that they would not take down
the poles and remove the dead wires
at the expense of the State. It was
asserted that the electric light com
panies would be highly gratified if the
commission should pay for the re
moval of the obstructions. The state
ment was made that two fires at Fol
som-street wharf had been caused by
the old wires.
Commissioner Henry Crocker is
somewhat surprised at the magnitude
of the expense account for repairs to

BOWERS' INFAMY
FINDS HIM OUT
Judge Graham Directs That
the Police Be Informed of
the Crimes of Saloon Man
DENIES HIM A DIVORCE
Says Offenses of Both Hus-
band and Wife Put Them
Beyond Ri^ht of Belief
John E. Bowers, keeper of the Ra
mona Saloon, Eddy and Taylor st.
has lefl the divorce court with the
recommendation of Judge Graham that
he be transferred to the keeping of the
police for prosecution for felony.
Bowers sued his wife. Mary C. for di
vorce, alleging Intemperance, cruelty
and infidelity. "When the case came to
trial yesterday, the houshold of Bowers
was proved a nest of infamy.
Letters introduced in court estab
lished the fact that Mrs. Bowers had
been the keeper of a brothel at Bt,
Helena and that while she wbb thus
engaged Bowers served her In the ca
pacity of a procurer, scouring th? town
for young girl? he_-eould induce to en
ter the unspeakable institution con
ducted by his wife. When Judge Gra
ham heard these facts he threw the di
vorce proceedings out of court, say in a;
neither party could commit an act
that would constitute basis for a de
cree of divorce, both havrng consented
to acts on the part of the other that
placed them outside the re^ef of th-?
law. He Instructed counsel in the
cape, however, to pla^e th? facts as de
veloped in the hands of Chief Dinan
that prosecution might follow. The
incriminating letters are still in the
hands of the court.
Decrees of divorce were granted yes
terday to George Beloff from Katie Be
loff for desertion, William H. Morgan
from Minnie F. Morgan for infidelity.
Isabella Papworth from Frederick
Papworth for extreme cruelty. Eliza
beth Waterman from Earl E. Water
man for cruelty and Almenia M#n
hennet from Edwin Menhennet for de
sertion.
The petition for annulment of mar
riage filed by Alice Spurway against
George Spurway was granted by Judg?
Hebbard yesterday. When the case
came up for trial a few days ago all
Mrs. Spurway had to support her claim
that her husband had another wife
living was two letters. In on* of which
Spurway admitted he was a bigamist
and In the other a Mrs. Mary Spurway
said she was the first wife of the de
fendant and Spurway had never di
vorced her. Judge Hebbard held, how
ever, that letters did not always set
forth the truth and he demanded fur
ther evidence. Yesterday J. L* Marsh
all, who knew the facts In the case,
testified as to the truth of the asser
tions contained In the letters and thÂ«
decree of annulment was granted.
Suits for divorce were fl!Â»d yesterday
by Fidelia Sherwood against Millldge
Sherwood for failure to provide. Mary
Smith against Charles Smith for fail
ure to provide, Mrs. V. Haas against
E. Hass for cruelty and Sarah E. Hun
sucker gainst Charles E. Hunsucker
for cruelty.
CONTEST FOR HEYWOOD HOME
CAUSES RECITAIi OF SECRET
Widow of Deceased Capitalist Accuse*
Adopted Dangtiter of Breaking
Cp Family.
Mrs. Agnes B. Heywood, widow of
the late Franklin Heywood, and Ag
nes Maud Heywood, adopted daughter
of the deceased, have joined Issues in
a contest for a homestead on the late
residence of the capitalist at 14 90
Hayes street. Mrs. Heywood filed her
answer yesterday to the petition of
Miss Heywood, asking the court to
declare a homestead in her favor. In
her answer Mrs. Heywood says the
homestead should be declared in her
favor and that in fact her husband
would have left her the property but
for the fact that tha adopted daugh
ter caused trouble between her and
her husband that was only settled a
short time before his death.
At the time of the adoption of Miss
Agnes Maud Heywood, on May 11,
1877, says Mrs. Heywood. she was a
willful child and often had to be cor
rected. Mr. Heywood objected to the
correction of the child and the result
was the adopted daughter was al
lowed to have things her own way
until Mrs. Heywood could stand it no
longer and on July 10, 1890, she
signed articles of separation with her
husband. In IS 92. however, says
Mrs. Heywood, a reconciliation was
effected by her with her husband and
they celebrated the event by a trip to
Santa Cruz. While there he died,
leaving an estate valued at $220,000.
In view of the reconciliation Mrs.
Heywood claims the articles of sepa
ration were nullified by her resump
tion of marital relations and hence
she asks that decedent's old home bÂ«
set apart for her as a homestead and
that the petition of the adopted
daughter be . denied.
COMMISSION TO PROTECT
OCEAXSIDE FROM FIRE
Mill Endeavor to Utilize Water In
Golden Gate Park Reservoir
for the Purpose.
The Fire Commission met yesterday
and adopted the recommendation of
Chief Sullivan that step* be taken to
afford fire protection for Oceanside. In
his recommendation Sullivan states
that the Spring Valley Water Com
pany has twice refused to lay mains in
the district because the income from
hydrants would not warrant the ex
pense. Sullivan suggests that the per
mission of the Park Commission bÂ« re
quested to connect an eight-inch main
with the ten-inch main leading from
the Dutch windmill and reservoir In
Golden Gate Park, the main to run
along the Great Highway to P street.
In the event that the Park Commis
sioners grant the request to use the
water In case of necessity, then the
Board of Supervisor* will be ufced to ,
appropriate $10,000 In the next budget
to carry out the improvement, rfulli- â¢
van says that nre protection is impera
tive because more than 200 houses
have been built in the district and
would be at the mercy of a conflagra
tion.
The commission asked the City At
torney for an opinion as to whether
substitutes can receive the same pay aÂ«
the members of the department whom
they reliev*. It lÂ« the practice to pay
substitutes $80 per month, wherea*
the pay of men relieved la 190 to
$100 per month. The extra money is
turned back into the city treasury and
does no good to any one.
The City Attorney was also asked
for an opinion as to whether it is
within the power of the commission to
allow employes of the corporation
yard and stables an annual vacation
the same as other members of the Fire
Department.

LEARNS NAME
OF THE SIREN
She Was Passing Fair, Says
Foreman Andrews, and
Her _\ame Is Pauline
PLOT THAT FAILED
Stenographer Takes Down
the Lady's Pretty Tale in
Cold Black and White
There was gnashing: of teeth among
certain gentlemen closely connected
with tho Schmitz administration when
the tale of their alleged attempt to trap
Foreman Andrews of the Grand Jury
by use of a woman's wiles became
known. Miss Pauline Harris, the young
lady whose charms it was thought
would quickly dazzle the grand jury
man, remarked in her llat at 884 liddy
street last night that Andrews was
somewhat uncomplimentary. Several
of the men that are charged with set
ting this Delilah on the foreman's trait
held a conference with Ruef that re
solved itself into an indignation meet
ing last night at a downtown restau
rant. Their reflections were bitter, but
not as bitter as those of the lady whose
charms were laughed at.
On April 10 there came to the Grand
Jury rooma an elderly man of benevo
lent appearance. He knew a lady who
had" dope' on all sorts of graft. " This
lady had been _to Sacramento tluring
the session of the Legislature and had
a "line on everything." He would send
her to Mr. Andrews. "And her name
was Pauline."
Hut the elderly gentleman wanted to
ask a favor; he knew a young lady, a
very young lady, an orphaoi, who was
all alone and out of work. The elderly
gentleman's voice was mushy with
emotion when he spoke of the poor,
pretty child's destitution.
She came to the Grand Jury rooms,
this unsophisticated Pauline. She was
so bashful and shy at first. But Paul
ine was not clad in the homespun or
gingham of the stage ingenue. She
wore raiment that would make the
leading !ady take on the hue of one of
Dr. Ragan's tabooed carnations.
"I can typewrite," pleaded Pauline.
"Please let me work here with you.
This place would be so nice for a poor
girl, all alone in the world." Her eye
lashes were wet with tears. And her
name was Pauline.
Foreman Andrews did not say "Nay,
nay Pauline." He said very little, for
he knew that the lady's tears were of
the onion order and that she was con
cealing a merry laugh'at him under
her leg-'o-mutton sleeves.
But he was having a silent laugh at
her expenseâ a genuine one, for be
hind a screen Mrs. Collina, stenogra
pher of the Grand Jury, was taking
down every word of the conversation.
That is one reason why Pauline raves.
A woman hates to know that another
is a witness of her failure to dazzle.
"I am sorry for you," said Andrews,
"but the Grand Jury is going to be dis
solved in two weeks by Judge Lawlor."
"Quit stringingâ l mean, how mean,"
murmured Pauline. " r *on't you hire
other people here besides stenogra
phers?"
"Oh. yes," said Andrews, "we hire
thirty detectives and have them shad
owing people all the .time."
Pauline was interested. Andrews
gave her a lot of "information" which
she carried to her employers. So An
drews has the laugh on Pauline and
her friends. The lady is wild and sev
eral men connected with the adminis
tration are the wildest of them all.
One of these, who holds an important
commission, is said to be particularly
interested in the lady of the charms
that failed. And her name is Pauline.
A committee from the Grand Jury
inspected the office of the County
Clerk yesterday. Expert Young exam
ined the books and found them in ex
cellent shape. County Clerk Greif an
nounces that he believes the shortage
of $36,000 under the Mahoney adminis
tration may be made up. The commit
tee included Foreman Andrews, A. M.
Davis, H. J. Cordes, J. B. Keenan and
Mrs. Collins, the stenographer.

MASKED THUGS
ROB SALOONMAN
Two masked men entered the saloon
of John Basso, 3334 Mission street, last
night and,- leveling revolvers at the
proprietor's head, demanded the con
tents of the till. Basso quickly emp
tied the cash drawer upon the bar and
the men made off with $10 in gold and
a few dollars in silver.
The robbers rushed into the place at
about 11:30 o'clock, when Basso was
alone. They drew the pistols as they
entered and Immediately demanded
his money. They had probably been
lurking in the neighborhood waiting
until Basso was alone. Shortly after
the men ran out of the place the pro
prietor gave the alarm. When he ven
tured out the robbers had made good
their escape.
He could give very little description
of the pair except that they were the
Ã¼biquitous tall and short men. The
police believe that they are the same
pair that robbed and brutally beat
Jeremiah Jesmond at Twenty-second
and Harrison streets Wednesday
night.

Future Grain and Provisions. |
CHICAGO, April 20.â The price of wheat for !
May delivery broke an even 5 . oasts a bsshel !
here to-day. The slump ! was generally be- j
lieved to be evidence of abandonmeci of the ,
deal In May wheat by John W. Oat*s Heavy \
liquidation c â¢ j May characterized j trading dur- ,
tor the greater part of the session. - The lew- â 
est point was reached at $1 <*â¢- "Baying by}
shorts caused a partial recovery, but the mar- 'â¢
ket closed weak with May down 3fcc J*".y/
wheat finished J*Â©liÂ»c down. -Â£, Â£ JT-
Com was up -. s^c. oats were pratrtkfany "
unchanged, and previsions were oS hQiy^.
Weakness in the wheat market was mani
feet at ihe start- Initial quotations on May â 
were off Â«&%e at fl 13 to SI 13*?. July;
was a shade to j;c lower at S7'-*c to 6TV@ l
e7*ic Conditions Â«r.'ral!r were favorable to
the bears: O&e of the mate isfluenoes - was j
rain throughoet Nebraska. lowa. Illinois. â¢
Kansas, the Ohio Valley* and part* of Mis- 1
souri. Apprehension concerning j drouth dam- '.
age to growing wheat was "thus relieved. Soon .
after the -opening j May suffered perceptibly oa \
what reemed to be moderate profit taking, the .'â 
price declining to SI 12V Active buying of \
July by Armour, however, gave support to the I
entire , market. as a ' result May quickly ral- 5 .
lied .to â  $1. 13. Later the - selling of May be- j
came ; extremely heavy . and prices rapidly ' de- \
clined. A story that started a flood of offer- j
tags in the pit .was that Jobs. W. Gates had
effected a private settlement with the Armour

GALICIA FEARS
A REVOLUTION
obâ l for Guatemala Asks
Collector Stratton to
Bftflk the Conspirators
KEG OF POWDER FOUND
Even lee Cream Freezers
Are Looked Upon With
Suspicion in Some Oases
Felipe GalJeia. Consul at this port for
Guatemala, sees revolutions in his
dreams. Several weeks ago he notified
Customs Collector Stratton that bold
revolutionists in this oity were ahip-
pins arms to Central America for the
purpose of overthrowing the coffee-col
ored Government of Guatemala. Mr.
Galicia also wired bis fears and his
suspicions to the Guatemalan Minis
ter at Washington and the machinery
of state was at once put In motion to
thwart the schemes of the conspira
tors. Mr. Stratton was Instructed to
keep a watch upon all outgoing ship
ments for that part of the world, and
after diligent r--irch, assisted by his
special deputy. William B. Hamilton,
discovered two ice cream freeaers and
a patent churn Invoiced for Sal
vador. These dangerous machines were
chipped by a Yankee hardware man
on Market street â himself a deacon of
the church and totally incapable of
putting nltro-glycerine In an Ice
cream freeser or a patent churn. But
the secret service agents of the Guate
malan Government were not to be de
ceived by such a palpable subterfuge.
They learned from undoubted author
ityâ-indeed no secret was attempted to
be made of the â that the powder
mills at Santa Cruz and on the bay
Ehore have been turning out vast quan
tities of dynamite and blasting: pow
der for the past two years. They so
reported to Consul Galicia and the pow
der works may yet be stopped.
In response to the request of the
State Department, Collector Stratton
made another search yesterday and
Â«!iscovered a ten-pound kee of blasting
powder and a keg of nails on board
a vessel bound for San Bemito, Mex
ico, but the vessel was permitted to
clÂ£ar notwithstanding the imminent
peril that might arise to the presidency
. of Guatemala. v Special Deputy William
B. Hamilton \ras more alert than usual
yesterday and paid an official visit to
the steamship Panama. He was clos
eted with the captain for a long time
and when he emerged he refused to say
a word to the reporters. The odor of
wood alcohol and tobacco that perme
ated the cabin for some time after
ward indicated the character of the
contraband cargo that was under dis
cussion.
In order to allay the fears of the
Guatemalan representatives an order
has been Issued requiring all shippers
for Central American ports to- file their
manifests before the vessels clear.

Marine Fireman Thrusts :
His Children to Street
Severe Sentence Awaits Him
JAMES C. CRAWFORD
At point of an old cavalry saber, An
drew AdamÃon, marine fireman, drove
his wife and four young children forth
from their home. No. 6 Harrison ave
nue, and left them to obtain shelter as
b.-s<t Ihey could from a raging rain
storm. Then he detached all the pic
tures from the walls of the domicile,
piled them in a heap and, with drawn
sword, stood guard over them until the
police disarmed and arrested him.
Officer Young of the Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Children told
Police Judge Mogan that Mr. Adamson
was an unsafe person to be permitted
to remain at large. On a previous oc
casion when he was placed in
the Receiving Hospital for treat
ment for delirium tremens, the
united strength of six stalwart
policemen was no more than
adequate to restrain him from com
mitting violence until he could be
manacled. After ten days' detention
in the hospital he was dismissed as
cured and permitted to return to his
family. aÂ« he was their only means of
sustenance. but he soon resumed
drinking to recess and continued it un
til h - â  â¢'neated Its flight.
AniMiii; Lhoae who pleaded in behalf
of the defendant was former Police
Commissioner Hutton. but all appeals
for leniency were deprived of effective
ness by the conduct of the prisoner
himself. He openly threatened to sla\
his unfortunate wife and little ones at
the earliest opportunity, and the Judge
intimated that such opportunity will
r.ot occur for at least six months. The
case was continued till to-morrow,
ball being refused.
Adamson is burly of frame and bru
tal of countenance. During his incar
ceration Officer Young will see to It
that the helpless victims of his inhu-<
manity do not lack life's necessaries.
George Heise of 206 Jones street and
Miss Frances Russell went a-slum
ming night before last and in Mr.
Heise's possession was a large leath
ern wallet, containing $821 50, the
combined cash wealth of himself and
his companion. His portion of the
money, $760, reclined In a canvas bag,
while a small purse held Miss Rus
sell's 161 50. They were in an O'Far
rell-street concert hall at 2:15 o'clock
a. m. whfn the wallet and all its con
tents disappeared from the table
where Mr. Heise had deposited it, and
soon afterward Miss Bella Walker,
alias Gertrude Norton, was arrested
by Patrolmen Orr and Brady as she
was issuing from a Grant-avenue
lodging-house with the miasing recep
tacle in her hand. From it had been
abstracted $100, but in a pocket of the
woman's gown the officers found
$73 50, which reduced to $26 50 the
amount actually missing. She was
booked on two charges of grand lar
ceny and Judge Conlan continued the
hearing until this morning.
While in court Miss Walker-Norton
prudently declined to discuss her situ
ation. "I have nothing to say," she
Informed the inquisitive, "nor -will I
have anything to say until the proper
time arrives." She wore a brown op
era cloak over a pink gown and a Pan
ama hat was perched rakishly upon
her Titian coiffure.

In the possession of J. Edward, ar
rested for soliciting alms from pedes
trians on Kearny street, was found
documentary evidence that $5 was on
deposit to his credit in one of the local
banks.
"Why is the name of J. Edward ln
variabiy associated with wealth ac
cumulation?" musingly asked Judge
Mogan, In whose mind apparently hov
ered recollection of James E. Britt'B
precipitate rise to opulence. Nor had
memory of the lightweight champion's
thrift departed from his Honor when
he inquired if any fiats were discovered
on the prisoner's person.
Mr. Edward could not satisfactorily
explain his mendicancy while he had
money in bank, co he was ordered to
appear for sentence to-day.

Dr. Ernest Pring informed Judge
Fritz that the three-year-old son of
R. H. Merrett had not been hygieni
caKv Injured by smoking the ciga
rette* supplied by his indulgent father.
Nor did the little fellow's appearance
belie the physician's statement. His
cheeks were chubby and his eyes
bright as he sat upon his daddy's lap
and curiously watched the less-pam
perrd prisoners in the dock. The
charge against Mr. Merrett is that of
cruelty to a minor child and he was
given until Saturday to produce charac
ter testimony.
Bailiffs Hickey and Mahoney scowled
angrily as th<*y surveyed this entry on
Judge Mogan's calendar: "James Kelly,
drunk in public place; nativity. Irteh;
color, hlack: age, 27 years; residence
Oakland." F'Â«r it was the negro's
eleventh appearance in that tribunal
on a similar charge, and on each oc
casion he had persistently claimed the
Emerald Isle as his birthplace, there
by incurring the displeasure ' of the
bailiff?, both of whom were strong in
pride of race.

John Barnett was endeavoring to
wrest a. heavy mantel clock from the
grasp of Otto SJodel at Third and How
ard streets when Patrolman J. A. Ryan
split them asunder and arrested John
on Otto's complaint of attempted rob
bery. In the court of Judge Mogan
It was stated that John and Otto met
far the first time on the Barbary Coast
and each was so fascinated by the
other that they pot drunk together and
continued drinking umil all their
money was gone. Then it was that
Otto bethought htm of collecting $20
from a creditor on Third street, and
John accompanied him thither. While
en route Otto called at his apartment
in the St. George Hotel and took his
mantel clock along with intent to get
it repaired, and John coaxed him to
pawn the timepiece and devote the cash
proceeds to purchase of liquor. Otto
obstinately refused to accede to John's
request and in desperation John was
trying to commandeer the clock when
the policeman intervened. When the
Judge had patiently heard the fore
going story he reduced the charge to
that of simple assault and promised
to pronounce John's sentence to-day.
"Having undersized female crabs in
possession." was the misdemeanor of
which Giacoma Droghetti stood form
ally accused before Judge Cabaniss by
State Fish Commissioner Alex Vogel
sang. Upon the bench lay a diminu
tive crustacean, defunct, where it was
deposited as evidence against the de
fendant. Assisting the complainant
were two attorneys, and the defense
was also legally represented. When
the prosecution had put in its case
triumphantly pointing to the deceased
exhibit as proof of its contention that
thr law had been violated by the de
fendant and urging the court to make
â¢if him an example tnat would have
deterrent effect upon other persons
vho might be contemplating the re
moval from th^ir native element of
adolescent crabs, counsel for the de
fense launched a bombshell in the
shape of a demand that the sex of the
particular crab in question be deter
mined ere further proceeding be had.
His client was accused of having in
possession an undersized female erab â
mark well the word "female"â and it
remained for the prosecution to prove
that the exhibit offered there in cvi-
dence was a female crab. To obtain
such proof it might be necessary to
subject the exhibit to dissection by a
scientist, but the defense was in no
hurry â it would cheerfully wait.
"But will the crab wait?" inquired
his Honor, gingerly picking up the
crustacean and gazing at it. "Experi
ence with dead crabs has taught me
to regard them as peculiarly suscepti
ble to rapid decay, even after they
have been boiled."
"Perhaps experience has also
equipped you with ability to ascertain
the sex of that crab without enlisting
science to aid you?" hopefully ven
tured the prosecution.
"No, it has not," was the disappoint
ing response. "For the sake of all
concerned I would like to settle that
vexing question right here and now,
but alas, there is a limit to human
attainment. I will give you gentle
men till to-morrow to discover
whether this crab Is as alleged in the
complaint, and would suggest that no
time be lost In getting it under dissec
tion. If my olfactories are not decep
tive It Is already throwing out a hint
of what its sanitary condition will be
ere this day has fled."
Signor Droghettl and the material
evidence were hastily removed and as
the prosecuting trio departed, his
Honor assured it that in his tribunal
the laws that protect the weaker sex,
regardless of its species, shall ever be
sturdily upheld.
Affairs of the Dead Involved.
John F. Moore, as executor of the
will of the late Eleanor H. Moore, has
sued Dorothea Watson, as executrix of
the will of the late Peter W. Watson,
for an accounting of the affairs of the
decedents. The plaintiff alleges that
Mrs. Moore had great confidence in
Watson and left all of her affairs
with "childlike trust" In his hands,
with the result that when he passed
away there were many of her affairs
left unsettled by him. The suit in
volves stocks and securities valued at
about $50,000.

Signorina Tetrazzini Is so
Upset by the Acts of Her
Financial Manager That
She Can Barely Whisper
CHARGES AGENT WITH
EMBEZZLING MONEY
Tivoli's Favorite Songstress
Denies That Any Love
Affair Ever Existed Be
tween Her and Uriburu
Tetrazzinl made her first aDDearance
in Judge Conlan's courtroom yesterday
afternoon. There she swore out two
warrants charging her recent financial
manager, Dr. Jur Julio Ziegner Urlburu.
with embezzlement. She was accom
panied y her attorney, Alexander
Heyneman.
It had been whispered that the ar
rest was caused throuph motives of
Jealousy on the part of one of the tenor
singers of the company. This sugges
tion was scoffed at by Tetrazzinl.
"Affairs of the heart." she said, "had
nothing to do in the case. It is simDly
a business affair, nothing more."
When she appeared in court her
lovely voice that was wont to warble,
trill and dance cadenzas around hieh
cees and" dees In the mad scene of
"Lucia," to the wild delight of ereat
audience, was for the nonce para
lyzed.
The strain of excitement attending
the loss of her money had been too
much for her. When she stood before
Judge Conlan to swear to the com
plaint she could not apeak abdve a
whisper. The same captivating smile
that had sunk deep into the hearts of
her audiences here, was still there. It
was liberally displayed In Judge Con
lan's court to a large audience of of
ficials and attaches of the Hall of
Justice, who came in to get a glance
of one of the great songbirds of the
world.
The two complaints sworn to by the
fair soingstress, charged I'riburu with
having failed to remit the sum of 2000
francs on February 21, and 2000 franca
on March 21, to her dressmaker. Sorello
Dameno in Milan. This money Tetraz
zini avers she gave to Uriburu to for
ward. She says he did not send the
money, though he pretended he had.
WARRANTS ARK SERVED.
As soon as the warrants had been is
sued they were served on L'riburu by
Detectives Wren and Reynolds, who
have charge of the case.
Among the effects taken from Url
buru when he was arrested was a draft
upon A. Gibbs & Sons. London, in Uri
buru's favor, for $15,000, dated San
Francisco, March 15, 1905, and signed
by Prinz Adalbert of Austria, who is
one day likely to be ruler over that
country. Attached to this draft was a
letter to Gibbs & Sons, also purported
to be signed by Prinz Adalbert.
The letter read as follows:
Consulate de la Republica Argentina, San
Francisco, 15 de March, 1905â Mewera. A.
Glbbs and Suns. Bllllter Building. London, E.
C â Dear Sirs: Kindly note that I have Issued
on your goodselves $15.(XK) eichange on Banco
Naclonal, Mexico, In care of our family friend.
Yours faithfully,
PRINZ ADALBERT VON OESTKRREICH,
Este.
This letter and draft he is reported to
have flourished before Tetrazzini and
others with whom he wanted to obtain
financial standing.
He also had In his possession an un
signed draft in duplicate for 67,000
francs. It was dated San Francisco,
April 19, 1905. Two complimentary
tickets to the California Jockey Club
were conspicuous in his effects.
There was also a deposit tag for
$4497 50 in the Swiss-American Bank,
which he had deposited there to Tet
razzini's credit. This amount was
found to be In the bank intact.
Through an interpreter Tetrazzini
said:
I met frlburu ten years ago In Buenos
Ayres. I was singing there and he came on
the stage to make my acquaintance. I ha>l
trouble with my lmpresearlos and Vriburu
came to my rescue and help?d me out. We
were friends, nothing more. I never met him
in Peru, aa has been stated. He might have
met my sister there. When I came up to the
City of Mexico l'riburu acted as my financial
agent there. He said lie could always arrange
banking mutters to advantage. Well, he has
arranged them evidently to his advantage, for
I now find I am 27,000 franca short. My ward
robÂ«, which Is worth about $20,000. I had
made In Milan. When I wanted a new gown I
would order it from my dressmaker, Sorello
Dameno, and they would sen.l it to me. My
contract with them was to send them 2000
franca on the 21m day of each month.
TRUSTED URIBURU.
I intrusted the sending of some of this
money to Urlburu. Nine thousand francs of
this amount did not go. I also gave, him
$6000 in Mexican money when I wai in the
City of Mexico to aend to my bankers In
Paris. This money never reached Its destina
tion. Altogether I am out 27,000 francs.
When asked whether, as Urlburu
had stated, it was a plot raised by the
tenor, Bazelli, to oust Uriburu from
the favors of the Tivoll star, Tetraz
zini burst Into fits* of laughter. Point-
Ing her finger at Bazelli, who was
â lttlng in the opposite corner of the
room, she said:
"Isn't that ridiculous? I suppose,
perhaps, that Urlburu will now olalm
that Baaelli signed the 'fake' bank re
ceipts that he (Urlburu) gave me."
Urlburu looked serious yesterday, so
soon as he learned that Tetrazzinl had
sworn out the warrants charging him
with embezzlement. He presented a
woe-begone expression. He said he
wanted to see a lawyer. His friend,
E. C. Cullen. who knew him in Buenos
Ayres, was in consultation with, him
and acted as his interpreter. Urlburu

said he knew nothing about the bank
receipts that were the basis of the
charges upon Vhich he was arrested.
Regarding the draft for $15,000 drawn
upon A. Glbbs & Sons, London, he de
clined to make any statement. He,
however, stoutly asserted that he and
Tetrazzinl had been on the most inti
mate terms of friendship. He said
his arrest was the result of a plot
raised by Baaelli because Bazelll was
jealous of him and wanted to get
him discharged as manager.
Uriburu's ball was fixed at $2500
cash on each charge, or a bond of
$5000 in each case. He will have a
preliminary examination this morn
inar.
The $460 found on Urlburu when he
was arrested at Tait's on Wednesday
night was turned over to Joaquin
Wanrell. Urlburu said that this money
was sent by the manager of the opera
house in the City of Mexico to pay the
railroad fares of the company here
down to that place. Wanrell was the
representative of the company here,
so the money was turned over to him.

Town Talk's Easter number Is out, and
like all the specials of this newsy and
literary weekly It abounds in reading
matter of absorbing interest and timely
illustrations. That brilliant stylist. Ed
win Clough. has written in his usual vig
orous vein of the short story and of the
cheapness of the masterpieces of litera
ture compared with those that win prizes
in magazine contests. Theodore Bonnet
discusses "The Worship of the Howl."
apropos the indiscriminate praise of the
Conried singers. The Saunterer tells of
the libeling of San Francisco a richest
club and points the significance of a re
cent club election. He gives some Inter
esting news In connection with Porter
Ashe's engagement. He tells about wo
men that pestered Caruso, about an In
genious society girl who had heard "Par
sifal" in the role of a reporter, and he
gives a lot of "inside" information con
cerning State and city politics. He also
tells of society women who kept Lent
and of others who did not. Town Talk's
short stories are always good, but the
one this week by Oliver White, who
writes for no other California^ publica
tion. Is one of the quaintest tales that
ever emanated from bis pan.
