CALL BUREAU, HOTEL BARTON,
WASHINGTON. Dec 1Lâ It is now
assured that the endowment house
secrets will be revealed at the hearings
before the Senate Committee on Privi
leges and Elections, which will again
take up the case of Senator Reed
Ssioot to-morrow. The revelations
bid fair to be more sensational than
any that have yet been made in re
pard to the Mormon church.
It is asserted that the endowment
house ceremony compels a member
of th<? church to renounce allegiance
to the United States and this will be
one of the principal arguments in op
position to Senator Sxnoot. Three
witnesses will be produced by Robert
\V. Taylor, counsel for the opposition,
who will give a complete account of
ell endowment house ceremonies.
Other testimony obtained since the
adjournment of Congress last spring
goes to rhow the power of the Mor
mon church in politics and the politi
cal aim? of the apostles. Senator Du
bois. a member of the committee, who
i.s flsliting- tho Mormon -church in the
State of Idaho, insists that the Mor
mons are likely to hold the balance
of power in the United States Senate
within the next dozen years unless
something Is done to curb their in
fluences. ; * -i ;
When Joseph Smith and apostles
who testified last spring were asked
about the endowment house secrets
thpy refused persistently to answer.
The only reply that could be obtained
by the repeated questioning by mem
bers of the committee was that the
endowment house ceremonies had not

church.

Lawyers Express the Belief That Sh3
Cannot Be Convicted on a
Forgery Charge*-
CLEVELAND, Dec. 11. â According
to the most accurate estimate of the es
tate of Mrs. Chadwick that is possible
before the receiver has Investigated her
assets ana reported his findings to the
court, her creditors as a whole will re
ceive about one and one-half mills on
the dollar. What lends additional in
terest to this showing: from the credit
ors' standpoint is that! one man, Iri
Reynolds, will receive^ the whole of the
assets visible at , the present time.
There may be funds in reserve some
where, as there may be additional cred
itors who have not yet announced that
Mrs. Chadwick is Indebted to them,
but it is not expected by bankers and
attorneys of this city, who have the
greatest knowledge of her affairs, that
anymore large loans will be developed.
The extent of her operations is now be-,
lieved to be approximately as follows:
Secured from Citizens' National Bank
of Oberlin and various sources in and
about Lorain County, Ohio, 5500,000.
Borrowed from business men in Pitts
burg, $500,000.
, Borrowed -from Herbert D. Newton,
$190,000. : :.
Total, $1,190,000. .. .'
Against this stands security of known
value on one note; amounting -to $1800,
'whf cti*iVheld ' by Iri' Reynolds."" T
THAT PITTSBURG LOAN.
The ' amount of money received by
Mrs.. Chadwick in Pittsburg may run
as high as $800,000, but it is believed
that r a : portion of this sum is a bonus
promised by her for an original loan of
at least $500,000. Her creditor there fig
ures that she is indebted to him for the
larger amount, while she'^has admitted
that she owes $500,000. If her debt in
this direction Is $800,000 the probability
in sight of the creditors is about one
and one-fifth mills on the dollar.
.It Is not believed by any of the at
torneys in the case that the Carnegie
securities will be of any account what
ever. . If they do at any time .reveal
value other thai* that of so many cents
per pound of white paper, the delight
of the lawyers will b'e comparable only
to their amazement, and Just now they
are, expecting neither pleasure nor as
tonishment.
The case of Mrs. Chadwick will to
morrow morning be brought before
the Grand Jury of Cuyhoga County.
The' Investigation w511 extend only to
the, alleged forgeries of the Carnegie
notes and a report from the Jury Is
expected not later than
It is the opinion of some of the
leading attorneys of Cleveland that a
charge of forgery cannot be made to
hold In connection with these notes.
They declare that it is not an act of
forgery for one person to write the
name- of another, but that the-offen3e
lies in the attempt to negotiates^such
a signature for a specific value. . This,
they say. there is so far no evidence
that Mrs. â  Chadwick has done. She
has not sold, or attempte'd to sell, the
notes for. cash. She has not said that
she would be glad to obtain money in
exchange for them. She has obtained
money from various sources on the
statement of Iri Reynolds that she, to
the" best of his knowledge and belief,
held 'securities of a certain value, and,
whether- he prove correct or otherwise
in his value of the notes, there can be
no doubt that Reynolds believed what
he' said.
The loan of. $.800, 000 said to have
been; received by Mrs. Chadwick in
Pittsburg, or from a. man residing in
that city, is declared to have been
made to her by a multimillionaire
manufacturer of that city. Mrs.
Chadwick. in discussing thl3 state
ment, declared that she did owe him
$500,000, but not $800,000, as had
been claimed.
CLAI3IED CARNEGIE AS FATHER.
Secretary Iri Reynolds of the Wade
Park Bank declared to-night that his
implicit belief in the statements^made
to him by Mrs. Chadwick, in which
she declared herself to be the daughter
of Andrew .Carnegie, was the impelling
"cause- of his financial dealings with
her.
"She told me," said Reynolds, "that
she was the Illegitimate daughter of
Andrew "Carnegie and I believed her-
I never doubted her story until on the
occasion of my last visit to* New. York,
when Seulre came to me and declared
that all-the securities she; had given

were worthless. It was only then that

CALL. BUREAU. HOTEL BARTON,
WASHINGTON, Dec. 11.â According to
the census bulletin made public to-day
there are more men than women in the
United States, but in the cities there
are more women than men. The deduc
tion is made, from the statistics gath
ered, that the women live longer than
the men. Professor Wlllcox of Cornell
University wrote the discussion and
analysis of the bulletin and some of the
conclusions drawn from the tables are
of scientific and practical Importance.
The whole population of the conti
nental of the United States was first
counted with distinction of sex in 1S20.
During the seventy years from 1S30 to
1900 the absolute excess of males was
greater at each census than at any pre
ceding census, with one exception â that
o/ 1870, when the excess of males was
less than in 1850 and 1860.
This reduction of the excess of males
between 1S60 and 1870. by about 300,000
was doubtless due to the deaths in the

LONDON, '.'Oct., 11.â Judge and
counsel in a London court yesterday
argued the question whether a school
master could claim to be a gentleman.-
The schoolmaster's solicitor raised the
question in applying for his client's
costs as a witness under the head of
"gentleman," ' or "professional man,"
instead of on the lower scale of
"tradesman," as ordered by the court
registrar.
Judge and counsel agreed that
Blackstone's definition of "gentleman"
as "one who bears arms" was obsolete,
and counsel advocated a definition of
"one who by education, occupation or
income holds a position above menial
service or ordinary trade."

GREAT GROWTH
OF OUR TRADE
Secretary Metcalf Reports
That in Last Fiscal Year
It Exceeded All Becords
TAKES UP EXCLUSION
WASHINGTON, Dec 11.â The for
eign commerce of the United States for
:he x>ast fiscal year, as set forth by
Secretary of Commerce and Labor _et
-alf in his annual report. Just submit
ted to the President, shows a larger
â¢otal than In any earlier year. While
he exports were surpassed by those of
'. single year, 1901, and the imports
vere also purpassed by those of a sin
jle year, 1903, the aggregate of imports
;nd exports for the year is greater than
hat of any preceding year in the his
ory of our commerce. The imports of
he year were 5991,087.371 and the ex
;Â»orte J1.4C0.827.271, making the total for
. ign commerce of the year $2,451,914,642,
which exceeded by J6.053.726 the high
record established by the year 1903.
The total of agricultural products e*^
ported fell J19.679.803 below that- of the
preceding year and formed a smaller
percentage of the total domestic ex
ports than in any preceding year, while
exports of manufactures were the
largest ever recorded, exceeding, by
$44,869,762 those of the preceding year
and surr>apsing by $18,564,165 the high
record established in the year 1900.
The reduction in exports of agricul
tural products was chiefly due to the
small expectations of breadstuffs, which
amounted during the year to $149,050.

INVESTIGATION OF TRUSTS.
Secretary lietcalf states that the Bu
reau of Manufactures was not orga
nized during the past year because of
the insufficiency of the appropriation.
The total appropriations for the year
amounted to $13,745,374 70. of which a
email balance remains unexpended.
In his estimates for the fiscal year
1906 the Secretary aeka for an addi
tional sum to properly organize his bu
reau. There is also included a sum to
be expended under the immediate di
rection of the Secretary' for the inves
tigation of trade conditions at home
Â«.nd abroad, with the object of promot
ing the domestic and foreign commerce
of the United States, and for other pur

expresses the opinion that this mate

NEW LAWS *X)K CHINESE.
Turning to the subject of immigra
tion, the report says the structures
maintained at the different ports of
entry for the accommodation of aliens
detained pending examination have
been materialy improved, but it will
be necessary to make further improve
ments and build new structures. This
Is especially true at >he port of San
Francisco, where, in addition to aliens
generally, the bulk of Chinese immi
grants apply for admission. The re
port' adds that signal success has
marked the administration of the
Chinese exclusion laws during the
year.
New legislation is again recom
mended. Provision is urged for the
distribution of aliens in accordance
with views heretofore expressed by
the department; for the physical in
spection of aliens by officers of the
Public Health and Marine Hospital
Sen-ice stationed at the ports of for
eign embarkation; for the establish
ment of a moral and manual standard
for admissible aliens; for the compila
tion of data in regard to the annual
departures of aliens frÂ«m the United
States; for the reglstraflSn of all Chi
nese lawfully resident in the United
States at this time, thus furnishing
them with certificates which will af
ford them immunity from arrest, and

NARROW ESCAPE
OF A MERCHANT
San Francisco Grain Dealer
Is Almost Suffocated .in
Fire That Destroys Home
BUILDING TOTAL LOSS
Special Dispatch to The Call,
SAUSALITO, Dec 11.â Fire broke
out in the beautiful residence of Wil
liam Berg, the well-known grain mer
chant of San Francisco, this afternoon
and in a short time nothing remained
of the structure. All the priceless
antique furniture^ and ornaments in
the house were saved. Berg, who was
in the house when the fire started.ovas
nearly suffocates by the thick smoke,
but luckily reached a place of safety.
The fire, presumably caused by a fle
ft-ctlve flue, started in the attic of the
house. Shortly after noon Berk start
ed a fire in a grate which had not
been used for some time. Some ex
celsior was burned and it is supposed
that the burning straw found an exit
near the attic. An alarm of fire was
turned in "and in a few minutes the
<Â£ausalito fire department responded
and did noble work. Every bit qt fur
niture in the house was saved and had
the fighters had more water and bet
ter fire fighting apparatus the residence
might have been saved. By persistent
lighting the men managed to save the
adjoining residence of P. Wheatland.
A few days ago Mr. Berg received a
load of antique furniture from Europe
and had the flre started at night prob
ably everything would have been lost.
POSSE AFTER
"PAT" CROWE
ST. JOSEPH, Mo., Dec. 11.â A force
of policemen, deputy sheriffs and de
tectives has been searching the
souri River bottomlands north of St.
Joseph to-day for the hiding place? of
Pat Crowe and Sam, alias '"Horse
thief," Johnson, who met Detectives
Wilson and Wheeler early this morn
ing and exchanged a fusillade of shots
with the outlaws. Both officers are
confident that one of the men was
wounded during the exchange of shots.
The men are believed to be still hiding
in the dense brush of the bottom lands.
Late yesterday afternoon the secret
service department received a tip from
a reliable source that Pat Crowe, the
much-wanted Cudahy kidnaper, was at
the home; of Charles Christian. Detec
tives Wheeler and Wilson were detailed
on the case.
Driving to the locality the two offi
cers secreted themselves in the sand
hills southwest of Christian's house.
However, nothing was seen of the men
until. early this morning.- After lying
on the ground the officers became chill
ed and started to draw a trifle closer
to the Christian home.
Just at that moment two men '.were
seen to leave the side doorway. In the
dense darkness it was impossible to
recognize either. The two detectives
posted themselves at an advantageous
position at the roadside. As the two
men came within ten paces both offi
cers stepped to the road.
"Threw up your hands'; we are offi
cers'." exclaimed Wilson. A curse and
a volley of shots was the answer. Beth
officers open' 3 fire with rifles. The two
men sprang from the road, firing- rap
idly until their guns were emptied, and
escaped in the darkness.

"For six months through my story,

'"Last Tuesday morning I publicly

tcld the truth it will go back to 33. If
they lied theywill smash it back to 33.

times that this was 'only . the second
time that it had been held since "1870.%.*
The basilica .was -b&autlful with elec
tric lights, its immense height showing
the illuminations . to perfection. The
throne had > been, erected behind .the
high altar and chair of St^Peter, hav
ing a device of rays of gold with "a
picture of tlie trinity: in the center. Al
together "the throne took up a space
of ninety by seventy ; feet. ' Four ban- ',
ners hung under s the dome, showing
the chief miracles of the new saints. I
The papal procession met in the Sis
tine Chapel, entering the basilica by
the Chapel of the Holy Sacrament. The
Pope, in the full ; pontifical costume,
was carried in the Bedia gestatoria,
with fts historic fans. His robust figure
and handsome " head showed thus to
best advantage and when he entered
the church : it was impossible, for the
authorities to repress entirely an out
burst of loyalty from the multitude,
which cried "Long live Pope Pius!"
The scene was such as to evoke the
devotion of the beholder, everything
having been done to heighten the ef T
feet, the, central figure In 'the cere
i!i<Â«n'al presenting a scene never to be
forgotten. His Holiness was preceded,
surrounded and followed by guards of
tlic court and high prelates. He looked
pa le, â¢ fatigued and less robust than a
year ago, as- though the triple' crown
were bearing heavily upon ' him. The
Pope was thus escorted to the throne,
the Cardinals, Archbishops and Bishops
forming a square about him. â¢
The ceremony that followed was in
teresting in the extreme. Pope Pius
pontificated, preserving- a calm, rever

LARGEST VOTE
YET RECORDED
' NEW YORK,' Dec. 11.â The Times to
morrow will say: "A canvass by the
Times of the p,pular vote at the last
Presidential election* complete e:-}ept
as to one county in Tennessee and four
counties in Michigan, where estimates
are given, shows that President Roose

Ho polled the largest vote ever given a
President of the United States>7,640,560.
This is more than 400,000 in excess of
the vote cast for McKlnley in 1900.
"The official figures for Missouri show
that Roosevelt carried that State by
25,600. In Maryland one Republican
elector received the largest vote, but
his colleagues were defeated. The
Democrats of Maryland, therefore, will
have seven votes in the electoral col
lege while the Republicans will have
only or.e.

1900 shows a marked change In the So
cialist vote. Debs; the candidate of the
party that year, was also this year's
condidate, and his vote shows an in
crease of mare than 300,000. Watson,
the Populist candidate, ran strongest in
his own Stc'.j, Georgia, where he re

"The stories of her giving large sums

"Just to show. the methods of Mrs.

,ffcred-to. do for me about a .year ago.
She came to me in my office here and
said she was grateful for all that -I had
done for her and that she wished nie
t'o accept, a present from' her. She then
offered > me $100,000 in four notes . of

DR. CHADWICK IS FOUND.
PARIS, Dec. 12.â Dr. Leroy S. Chad
wiek was found and interviewed by the
STew York World correspondent at his
hotel here yesterday. Chadwiek, who
seemed to be under great nervous ten
sion; said positively that he knew and
had known nothing of his wife's "al
leged business transactions," and that
the revelations concerning them and
her had : "all come as a horrible shock"
to him. So far as he knew Uts. Chad
wiek did not know Andrew Carnegie
and has never even met him.
Nevertheless the doctor resented the
comparison of his wife's transactions
with those of Mme. Humbert, and said
he believed Mrs. Chadwiek simply ne
gotiated paper she thought was good.
This important interview was not ob
tained easily. The World's correspond
ent learned the hotel where Dr. Chad
wiek and a child by his first wife are
stopping. He called up the doctor on
the telephone and asked him to grant
an interview. :
"Come to see me," Chadwiek an
swered. "But how will I know. you?"
Then he added in a weak, nervous
voice, "I will carry a white handker
chief In ray, right hand, and you do
likewise." : '
YOUTHFUL IN APPEARANCE.
The correspondent found a young
looking man, seemingly not more than
30 years of age, sitting In the place ap
pointed. So youthful was his appear
ance that his visitor would not have
suspected. he was Chadwiek.
Chadwiek had a copy of a Paris
newspaper containing his wife's por
trait. The picture showed m- handsome
woman, but after regarding it flxedly
he exclaimed:
"That's not her picture; she is much
better looking.
"She in no way needed money," he
continued. "My daughter Mary, who is
with me. is 19 years old. so she fully
appreciates what ail this means to me.
Like me, she Is greatly shocked by the
newspaper reports, nor can she under
stand why Andrew Carnegie's name
figures so largely. I saw my wife last
just prior to November 15. She looked
and behaved as usual." ,
"Did .your daughter last month cable
to Iri Reynolds, the Cleveland banker,
asking for money?"
"That is something I will not deny or
affirm," answered Chadwiek. "If Rey
nolds wishes to talk about the incident
he can."
Chadwiek is an extremely weak man,
who could easily be controlled, even
hypnotized, by a strong woman. He 1
never let from his hand the newspaper
which had g^en him ,the opportunity
to mention that his wife Is good-look
ing, y
WILL REMAIN T N JAIL
NEW YORK, Dec. 11.â From present
indications It is extremely unlikely that
any attempt will be made to obtain bail
for Mrs. Chadwiek, who has been in the
Tombs since last Thursday night on a
charge of aiding and abetting bank of
ficials in the embezzlement of $12,500.
She is held under $15,000 bail. A person
who is in a position to know the vari
ous moves in the Chadwiek case spoke
as follows. to-day:
' Despite all reports to the contrary, no active
efforts have been made/to obtain ball for Mrs.
Chadwiek In this city. There are plenty of
people here who wculd sign her bond If asked,
but the fact Is it Is not deemed advisable for
Mrs. Chad wick to leave the City Prison at
present. If ahe.were released on ball the Gov
ernment could demand twenty-four hours In
which to examine her surety. Meanwhile tha
Government attorneys could telegraph the
Cleveland authorities and t>eforÂ« the twenty
four hours expired could . have additional
charges sent here so that It would be necessary
to procure nexr ball. 1
This proesdure could be carried cut as long
as the Government officials thought they hod
tharges. Again there ml^ht come a conflict in
authority. A county Grand Jury might find an
Indictment, against Mrs. Chadwiek and then
the matter of extradition would come up In a
different llpht irem any yet suggested.
I am of the opinion that Mr*. Chadwiek will
remain quietly in the. Tombs for the present.
Her examination is sot for next Saturday be
fore United States Commissioner Shields. In
case Mrs. Chadwiek Js held for. the Federal
Grand Jury It Is not at all unlikely (that one
of the, Rr*atest legal battles fought 1 , In New
York will follow. iÂ£S%_BB___fi___!
A~ lawyer who has been connected
with the recent flnanclaldlnlculties. In
answer to the â  report that stops might
be eventually taken to compel the re
turn of Dr. Chadwiek to this country,
said: v
Any person, who says that Dr. Chadwiek can
bÂ«s brought back to theUnited States against
his witlTbecause he gave Herbert D. Newton
checks which were returned markÂ«>d "without
funds" knows nothing of the . law. Had the
doctor bought a coat and given a worthless
check he .could- have been held for obtaining
money ' under false pretenses, but in thia case
there was no value -received. He - is said . to
havÂ« given two chocks aggregating $50,000 as a
part paymuit of, his wife's indebtedness. The
checks were. valueless, but no crime was com
muted, for * Dr." Chadwlck received nothing.
Newton ' gave ; nothing. = In other words, there
was no value received and : therefor* no crime
committed. .
COIN MAY i BE WITH' HIM.
? -It haÂ« been ' raid . that , Mrs. 7 Chadwiek settled
$2,300.0*10 of. the money . she - borrowed . on - her
husband three years ago.', That will be a diffi
cult thing to prove. It must 7 , first bo shown
that she borrowed * the . money and then <that
It ,was borrowed fraudulently. :. It would. seem
reasonable th^t If the woman could borrow
such a sum of money she muBt have 'had some
excellent securities. It must be borne. In mind
that ths first Carnegie nota. which plays the
most important role in this tragedy ot finance.
Is. much less than four years old. whlftU was
more than three years ego that $2,500,000 was
Mid to hÂ»va be*n settled ion JDr. Chadwiek. it
would have been impossible In so short a time

I believe It most unlikely that any attempt
will ever be made to bring Dr. Chadwiek bacK
on any such hypothesis. Those who know him
best believn that whatever wealth be has he
acquired honestly. :

the Tombs. The prison physician found
her in excellent health. ' . \

give bond for Mrs. Chadwiek he would
use his influence with United States
Commissioner Shields to have the ball

fixed. V ... .
An incident which may have some
significance occurred to-day when a
number of reporters at the Tombs ad
dressed a note to Mrs. Chadwiek, ask
ing if she would mate a statement and
also when 'she expected to be released.
To this she returned the word; "To
morrow." The newspaper men â¢ -were
puzzled as to this answer. Believing
that she had finally, decided to waive
examination and go to Cleveland, they
attempted to clear up .this point
through the medium of another note,
but the officers of the Tombs would
not permit it to be taken to Mrs. Chad

LETTER FROM
THE LANDLORD
Pommer-Eiiers Enabled to Ex
tend Sale at the Eleventh
Hour.
Three Carloads of Brand New High
est Grade Pianos Added, tut
Time Is Jhort and Premises
Must Be Vacated Promptlyâ See
These New Pianos and Gat Re
moval* Sale Prices and Terms
On account of important changes in
the building plans, and delays in steel
shipments, the big Pommer-Eilers re
moval sale of pianos and organs is to
continue a few days longer. *
. At the eleventh hour, and after most
of the tenants of this big building had
left, we received word from the owners
of these premises, offering us the use of
our warerooms a few days longer. The
following letter will explain itself:
"HERBERT E. LAW,
"San Francisco. Cal., U. S. A..
"December 9. 1904.
"Messrs. Pommer-Eilers Music Co., City.
â¢Gentlemen: Owing to decided changes
in the plans for the new . Monadnock
Building,* we are in position to give you
occupancy for a couple of weeks longer
from this date. . -
"We are counting definitely, however,
upon your vacating- the entire premises
at the earliest possible moment, and in
no event later than Saturday evening
December 31st. according to the terms of
agreement between ourselves.,
"Very sincerely yours,
"(Sig.) HERBERT E. LAW"
Accordingly, this removal sale will
continue. The remainder of this elegant
stock of fine pianos will be closed out at
the old stand. And to add special inter
est to the closing days of this big salt
we have decided to include another car
load each of KirabaUs, Deckers and Ha
zeltons in the slaughter.
These cars have just come in from the
respect Â¥v* factories, with whom we have
contracts for supplying us month in and
month out a certain number of pianos
Bear In mind that these last Zhreo car
loads are the finest and choicest product*
of the three world-famous factories
mentioned, and they will go at the enor
mous discounts offered heretofore, on ac
count of which low prices this removal
sale of ours has become the greatest ever
held in the history of piano merchandis
ing. Up to date over $135,000 worth of
fine pianos and organs have been sold in
this sale. â¢
On account of the terms under which
we temporarily surrendered our lease,
we are in position to Ignore factory costs
and retail profits, and secondly, as one
of the strongest financially concerns in
the business, we are not pinched by anx
ious manufacturers nor hard up for
money, and can therefore afford to sell
to the retail buyer on the most conven
ient and easiest terms of payment.
On payments of little more than ordi
nary rent we are now selling the choic
est and most costly of highest grade
American pianos, brand new and fully
â¢warranted, at a saving: in price of nearly
one-half the regular retail value of an
instrument. .
No matter what Inducements may be.
held out to you elsewhere, bear in mind
that Pommer-Eilers are surely able to do
better for you â whether it be In the sale
of an ordinary though serviceable square
piano (we have them from $18 up), or a
good ustd upright of reliable make
(from 564 up), or one of those superb
latest design Deckers or Hazeltons or
Klmballr. or Lesters â at Pommer-EUers*
Removal Sale you will now find yourself
in position to. effect a substantial saving
over what is or ever has been offered
elsewhere. :

Riots of 1901 Are
Duplicated in the
Czar's Capital.
"PEACEI" THE CRY
Fifty Participants in
Demonstration
Are Injured.
ST. PETERSBURG, Dec 1Lâ A pop
ular anti-Government demonstration,
the participants in which Included large
cumbers of students of both sexes, be
gan at midday in the NevEky Prospect
and lasted about two hours. Hun
dreds of police and mounted gend
armes, who were hidden in the court
yard of the public building, emerged
suddenly and charged the crowd at
full gsilop, driving the demonstrators
in headlong confusion and screaming
with terror upon sidewalks and into ad
jacent streets. This led to several en
counters, fifty persons being more or
less severely injured. Large numbers
T. - ere arrested.
Not since the riots of 1901, when Cos
eccks, stretched across the Neveky
Prospect from building to building,
charged down the boulevard from the
Moscow station to the Neva, has the
Russian capital lived through such a
fiay of excitement as this. The au
thorities last night learned of the
big anti-Government demonstration
planned for to-day by the Socialist La
bor party to demand an immediate end
of the war, and the convocation of a
national assembly, and leading every
Taper this morning in black-faced type
â¢was an explicit warning to the people
at their peril to desist from congre
gating in the Nevsky Prospect near the
Kazan Cathedral.
POLICE ARE REIXFORCED.
At the same time extensive prepara
tions were made to quell any disturb
ances- The police on the # Nevsky Pros
pect were sextupled, and the dvorniks,
or house porters, were marshaled in
front of their respective buildings. A
half-dozen squadrons of mounted gend
armerie were massed in the rear of the
Kazan Cathedral and battalions of re
serve police were stationed in several
courtyards out of sight.
Minister" of the Interior Sviatopolk-
Mirsky gave strict orders, however,
that no Cos?acks should be used, and
Fullon, Chief of Police, issued special
orders to avoid harsh measures unless
it should become absolutely necessary.
The newspapers' warnings, by giving
â notice to those not apprised of the
I rospect cf a demonstration, defeated
the very object for which they were
designed, atracting seemingly the
whole population of this vast city to
the bro'ad thoroughfare, and long be
fore the hour fixed, despite the plead
ing! of the police, who literally lined
the Eide walks, the throngs on the
pavements were so dense that move
ment was almost impossible, while the
snow-covered boulevard was black
â with a tangled mass of sleighs, filled
mostly v.ith the curious.
In thronsrs on the sidewalk were
practically the whole student body of
the capital, including many young
â¢women, who have always been promi
nent In Russia in Liberal revolution
ary movements, and also thousands
of workmen belonging to the Social
Labor party.

students seemed to swarm toward the
corner of the Hotel Europe, opposite
the Kazan Cathedral. The police,
recognizing that the critical moment
was approaching, tried in vain to keep
back the human tide.
Then, when thero was not a single
i mounted policeman in sight, on the
stroke of 1. from the heart of the
thickly wedged crowd a blood . red
flag, like a jet of flame, suddenly shot
up. It was the signal. Other flags ap
peared In the crowd, waving fran
tically overhead, and they were
greeted with a hoarse roar: "Down
with autocracy!" The students surged ,
into the streets singing the "Marseil
laise," while innocent spectators, seek
ing to extricate themselves, crowded
into doorways and hugged the wall.
NUMEROUS ARRESTS.
The ferment continued all day and
far into the night. So far there have
been more than 100 arrests.
To-night the, students of the Poly
technique and other institutions held
meetings, at which flery speeches were
made in favor of reform and the con- I
vocation of I a national assembly.
The greatest distress is expressed by
conservative Liberals over the day's
events, all declaring that just when
the fate of the Zemstvo programme
was in the balance, such a fruitless
outbreak will be sure to prejudice
every observer, and put the strongest
weapon in the hands of the bureau
cratic reactionaries.
That such demonstrations of the So
cial-Democratic labor party are not
confined to the capital is shown by a
letter received here from a prominent
Zemstvoist In Southern Russia, In
which the writer says:
The optimism with which we left St. Peters
burg is beirinnln*- to var.isn. The Government

way and enter frankly on the path of reform.
On the contrary, there teems to be hesitation
as to -whether it would not be better to return
to the path of reaction. The Government
seems unable to comprehend the real state of
popular feeling, the Importance of decisive ac
tion and the disastrous consequences of pro
crastination. The people of this province am

have- taken place in many towns and very spe

workmen.

and Paris." which declares itself In complete
antagonism to the moderate demands of the
i Zemstvo, It proclaims a definite socialist pro
gramme declaring it wants not political but |
roclal freedom. It will therefore be the policy
of the Government. If it decides to concede
nothing to It. to foster such dissensions 'be
tween the Zemstvo and the Labor party. -

workinsmen. can use their , antagonism to us
as an argument against the expediency of
granting the reforms demanded by. the moder
ates on the ground that they are net in real
sympathy with the wishesof the people.
Following is the text of the procla
mation of the' Social-Democratic labor
party calling attention to to-day's
demonstration:
We have raised cur voices calling for bet
ter things, but the Government has turned a
deaf ear to our cry- We f rom . day to day

workmen's lives under incompetent generals.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALt, MOND AY, V DECEMBER 12, 1904.
GENERAL XOGI. THE ADVERSARY
OF GENERAL STOESSEL AT
PORT ARTHUR. .
NAVAL COMBAT
AT PORT ARTHUR
LONDON, Dec. 11.â An unofficial re
port from Port Arthur, according to a
Tokio dispatch to the Dally Mall, says
the Japanese torpedo-boat destroyers
attacked the Russian battleship Sevas
topol at the mouth of the harbor on
the night of December 9, with what
result is not known.
The Dally Telegraph's correspondent
before Port Arthur reports, under date
of December 9, that there were desper
ate encounters last week. The bellig
erents, the correspondent adds, .mu
tually recognize the Red Cross and
collect the dead and wounded during
temporary suspensions of fighting.
The Daily Telegraph's' Tientsin cor
respondent learns from official Japan
ese sources that the Japanese casual
ties at Port Arthur the latter part of
October were 3000 killed and 10,000
wounded. The losses In more recent
attacks, the correspondent adds, were
much heavier. . â¢
The same correspondent has heard
that continual fighting is proceeding
south of Mukden.
The correspondent in Shanghai of the
Daily â  Telegraph, in a â¢ dispatch dated
December 11, says that, according to
Peking reports, the Russians have re
treated to the south bank of the Hun
River, after seventy-two hours' fight
ing, with heavy losses. On the fourth
day of the fighting, the correspondent
says, the Japanese assumed the offen
sive. The Mukden station is reported
to be in a wild state of confusion. .
The Daily Telegraph believes the au
thenticity of the foregoing reports
from Chinesq sources "of heavy fighting
is very doubtful.
TOKIO, Dec. 11.â The battering, of
the Port Arthur fleet continues arid
there is but Uttle ground for expecting
that it will ever again .engage the
Japanese. The battleship Sevastopol
continues at anchor outside , and it is
possible that she returns to the .harbor
at night. Her anchorage Is Inside the
outer, boom, which protects her from
torpedo attacks and, besides, the' heavy"
weather- recently has given her -added
protection.
Naval" experts,, are";. discarding ., the
theory that the Russians sank: any
ships themselves. The fact; that the
vessels first showed lists/ the exposed
positions of the sunken vessels and the
efforts of the Russians to save the
Sevastopol are regarded as conclusive
against the theory of self-sinking.
A majority of the sunken warships
lie headed northward. They received
the bulk of the flre across their port
sides. The fact that at least two show
ed lists to starboard gives rise to the
theory that the Japanese shells, ex
ploding inside the ships, against the
starboard armor, drove the armor out
ward, causing leaks. .
In order to end the question of their
future availability the Japanese con
tinue to drop shells Into the sunken
hulks.

Devoted Husband, Digs Up
Corpse of His Wife at

DEVOTION IS GEEWSOME
She Died When He Was Away
From Home and on Keturn
He Becomes Almost Frantic
Special Dispatch to Tha CaJL
i CADDO, I. T.. Dec 1Lâ As Btraag*
as fiction and so grewgome as to causa
those most familiar with it to shudder
when It is mentioned is the story of J.
W. Moons' remarkable devotion, to his
dead wifeâ a devotion which has caused
him to Ignore all conventions, the sen
timent of the community and the plead
ings of his friends arid to practically
alienate himself from the society of his
equals in a community, where he ranks
as one of .the wealthiest and most in
fluential citizens..
Moons' self -ostracism is the result of
his persistent habit of disinterring the
body of his wife, bathing it and cloth
ing it in fresh linen before' consigning
it back to the grave for another brief
period. . '?;'/
When Mrs. Moons died her husband
was away from home on a hunting
trip. It was impossible to communicate
with him, and neighbors and friends of
the family prepared the woman's body
for. burial and interred it before the ab
sent husband knew of her death. When
he returned and learned of his loss he
was almost frantic. He appealed to
some of the best women of-Caddo to
assist him In exhuming his wife's body
and preparing it for a burial to suit his
ideas. He said that he wanted the
corpse clothed in a black silk dress
which he had given his wife as a birth
day present and which she' had worn
but a few times.
The sympathetic women agreed to
humor him and the body was taken
from the grave/ where it had lain for
four days. They bathed and reclothed
it to suit the grief-stricken husband's
ideas. ,...',.''
The incident caused some discussion,
but a few- days later, when Moons
again appealed to certain ladies of the
town to assist him In again exhuming
and preparing the body for the grave,
the community was. shocked. Never
theless Moons succeeded In persuading
some respectable women V> 'assist him.
The body was again tasen from the
grave, bathed, clothed la fresh linen
and reinterred.
In a short time this procedure was
repeated, *and again and again did
Moons disturb the grave in' which' his
dead wife reposed to carry out his
grewsome ideas of devotion. He no
longer could obtain assistance from the
white women- of Caddo, and was
obliged to employ two old colored mam
mies to assist at the periodic rites.
Finally the negresses were frightened
from the work by stories of "spooks"
and spirits tdia'-to* Them 1 by"ind1gnant
white people. Now Moons -attends to

believed they have taken shelter out

a searching flre into nooks which can
not be observed from 203-lieter Hill
and other heights.
Observers report that a number of
tugs, launches, dredges and small craft
have 'anchored near the hospital ships
in the west harbor, evidently for the
purpose of obtaining protection. It has
been suggested that the besiegers no

Miss Bertlia Condon's Brutal Assailant Leaves No Clew

Diligent search made by Marshal
Kerns' men for the assailant of Miss
Bertha Condon, whose thrilling ex
perience has stirred all of North Berke
ley, has failed to find trace of the crim
inal. Armed men have patrolled the
Santa Fe railroad track from Berkeley
to 6chmlttsvlllÂ«, at which latter point
the girl says she mad* her escape from
her abductor, but absolutely no clew
to the daring wretch who kidnaped her
can be discovered.
Miss Condon, who la kept in bed by.
her mother, at her home, 1616 Delaware

upon her by a strange man, who way
laid her as che came from school last
Friday afternoon, and In the telling of
it varied not at all from the version she

BAPTISTS END
JUBILEE WEEK
Celebration of Fiftieth An
niversary of First Church
of Oakland Closes Happily
Oakland Office San Franlcsco Call,
1016 Broadway, Dec. 11.
The Jubilee celebration of the First
Baptist Church of Oakland, which be
gan last Sunday In honor of the fif
tieth anniversary of its organization,
came to an end this evening, the close
of the celebration being marked
by a Jubilee praise service conducted
by- the_ Rev, Homer J. Vosburgh. In
the morning the Rev. C. Al Wooddy,
D. D.. of Portland, Ore., addressed
the congregation; taking as his topic
"Fifty Fruitful Tjjgars in Church, BtatÂ«
and Nation."
After speaking briefly of. the great
progress made by the United States
and tbe State of California, Dr. Wood
dy outlined the history of the Baptist
church on the Pacific Coast during
the last half century. In part. Dr.
Wooddy ppoke as follows: !
The first church pi the Baptist denomination
to be eÂ«ULbli8he<l on the i'tx:i:ic Q>ast was
cjinniaed In a little town In Oregon In 1647.
wlLh leaa Uula fifty members. There <ltÂ» now

with a touti membership ot sumetbinf more
than 4U. (.â¢Â».Â». V, bÂ©n this church v.aa organized
â City yeaai ago ther* were but 800 members
of the Baptist church in the entire BU.tÂ« of
California. Tto-dajr there uÂ» 20,000 members
in tne State, aÂ«arl>- one-half of thÂ» entire
membership on thÂ« Faci&o Coast.
la Um United states to-<3Â»y thera are In
round numbers 5.000.0U0 members of thÂ« Bap
tist church, and tha amount raised by lhÂ«
church Â«ach rear for missionary purposes is
about {2.0>jO,ooo. When the First tta^Uat
Church of Oakland was established the Amer
ican Baptist Horn* Miesian&ry Society raised
ail told in the United States (30,000 each year.
TttÂ« j ear and far Us years paat, the sain* so
ciety has cpent that amount annually in Cali
fornia, alone.
Thes* thloe* show the progTâ made- by tbÂ«
church during the last half cealury, and w*
should feel proud to know that our church has
not fallen behind ia th* advanc* ot btato and
cation.
At the close of the morning service
special exercises were held for the
Sunday school and at 6:30 -p. rn. a
young people's rally was conducted by
A. W. Rider.
The closing sermon was preached
by the Rev. H. J. Vosburgh, whose
subject was "Our Place in God's
Plan." Mr. Vosburgh paid a high
tribute to the founders of the church
scd to those who had born* the bur
den of the work during Its early days.
In closing he said:
ftÂ»B tit words of thÂ» Ninetieth. (Fsajra. six

'â¢fchow thy servants thy work and their chil

Nothing Simple About life.
The author of "The Simple Life" dur
ing his travels In our country will see
"how for Americans cro to the other ex

life In Washington is a very complex
sort of existence, and as a people we
keep on piling up cares and troubles,
regardless of expense or what Rev. Dr.
Charles Wagner has to say on the
charm of true simplicity. In fact, the
phase is becoming obsolete. There is no
more simple life for us, not even in the

seems strange to. the police. Although
the district through which the girl was
dragged by her captor is sparsely
settled, still there are some houses and
persons are to be found along the line
occasionally. That none of these should
know aught of the affair in which Miss
Condon figured, despite the screaming
she says she did, has puzzled the offi
cers.
i It is not doubted by the police that
1 an assault was attempted, for, daring
as such an act may have been, it is evi
dent from the cycle of criminal aots
which have occurred In Berkeley dur
ing the last week that some desperate
characters are harbored In the quiet
college town. The criminal acts re
ferred to, all occurring within a week,
include the breaking of an .express
company's safe; the attempt at bur
glary In Otto Putzker's bicycle store,
the hold-up of two Italians by two
negroes at Center and Addison streets,
the attempted assault upon the two
daughters of H. Herr in "West Berke
ley by a negro and this latest affair In
which Miss Condon and an unknown
man figure.
The race track crowd is credited with
the responsibility for most of these
criminal acts and Marshal* Kerns' men,
in their attempts at apprehending the
offenders, are giving particular atten
tion to the neighborhood where the
racing devotees flourish, on the borders
of Berkeley.
WANTS ANOTHER
MAN ON BENCH
Bar Association Favors Taw
Authorizing Appointment
of Xew District Judge
After discussing thoroughly the tie
up of cases in the United States
courts owing to an overcrowded cal
endar, the Bar Association has decided
that the best rheans of relief is the ap
pointment of another District Judge for
the Northern District of California. A
memorial to Congress has been pre*
pared and the passage of a bill au
thorizing the appointment "of another
Judge will be urged.
The pressure of business in the Cir
cuit Court of Appeals has for a long
time been bo great that the Judges
have been compelled to devote almost
their entire time to the Appellate
Court to the exclusion of other busi
ness. The time xif the District Judges,
it Is said, is fully occupied by the busi
ness of the District Court and owing
to the distance of other District Judges
from San Francisco outside assistance
can be obtained only with great Incon
venience.
Among the relief measures suggest
ed is a bill providing for the division
of the district, with separate Judges
clerks and other officers. This meas
ure is not looked upon with favor by
the Bar Association as it believes there
is no necessity for an additional dis
trict within this territory and still
less for an additional clerk, marshal
and other court officers, as it Is not
believed this would accomplish the end
Bought.* The appointment of an ad
ditional District Judge to act in the
Circuit Court, will, it is said, be more
satisfactory.
After reciting existing conditions the
memorial says:
It Tollows that this work of thÂ« Circuit
Court must fall upon the District Judges. ThÂ«
District Judire for the Northern I>i*trict of
California \m occupied In his own court with
admiralty and bankruptcy questions which
arJsa from thÂ« great shipping- interests of San
Francisco Bay and vicinity and the large mer
cantile business of the communities around
that bay.
The result has been that the calendar of the
Circuit Court of the Northern District of
California has become crowded with cases
awaltlrg trial. â¢ ; .
A brief review of the calendar as called for
the November term of the present year will
demonstrate this:
. It appear* from the calendar that there
were ninety-seven causes In equity pending
and at lssusv in which testimony was then be
ing taken. There were sixty-five cases at law
at Issue and awaiting- trial. It Is estimated
hr the clerk of the .court that a cause In
equity will g-enerally require a day on final
hearinc. and that the averare time for the
trial of a case at law Is three days. In ad
dition to this, the court Is required to devote
at least one day a Week to the hearing- of Its
law and motion calendar.
It will thus be seen that it will require
some 292 days, or approximately one year and
a half,' of continuous sitting*, for the Circuit
Court to dispose of Its present calendar, al
lowing no i time for vacations, and assuming
that no new cases whatever were . brought on
for haarlns; during; that period. Such a situa
tion Is Intolerable. It prohibits litigants from
havlnr the speedy hearing- to which they are
entitled by the Federal conetltution, and
ampunts to. a. denial of justice. -
TAKES HIS. TEXT FROM i THE
LINES OF. VOLTVER TWIST"
â¢ "I am eager to know what propor
tion of this audience is made up of na
tive San Franciscans. All those men
who are strangers in this, city .will
please' hold up their hands."
This request was addressed, to men
present yesterday afternoon at the reg
ular Sunday afternoon meeting of the
Young Men's Christian Association by
Secretary Ellis. Nearly every hand in,
the hall went up and there was much
laughter at the small minority of na-:
tive-born citizens.' "It Is quite evident
from this," said the secretary, "that
the Toung Men's 1 Christian 'Association
Is well attended by strangers."
S The address of the afternoon was
delivered by the Rev. William Rader,
who recently returned from an extend
ed European trip. His /subject was
"The Triumphs of the, Good," select-
Ing the main points of his address
from the novel, "Oliver Twist!" After
giving. a short sketch of the. character,
Mr. Rader said in 'part:' .
- There are- swerai- lessons that can be drawn
from the life of Oliver Twist: First it is
unnecessary' to eay that the evils of city life
for cur- boys outweigh the good. , Our. cities
are fast becoming overcrowded with boys ' I
believe that half of the boys arid young, men
of San Francisco ehould b* sent Into the coun
try, because there. . Is , not . enough work , here
for them to do. There are too many young men
In this city, living from I hand td mouth. Sec
ond. God has great respect 'for the Rood in a
man. The poor man who *trucgleÂ«'to develop
the smallest Rood In him Is deserving- of far
more respect than the person surrounded with
all kinds of luxury. Save our boys ' from evil
and you will save the tuition. . .

DETECTIVES ON WATCH
Police Think the Same High
â¢ wayman Is Responsible for
Three Consecutive Holdups
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1016 Broadway, Dec. 11.
J. B. Duarte, residing at 403y a East
Twelfth street,' vanquished a footpad
this morning after a hot battle with
the lone robber, who began his attack
while Duarte -was walking along East
Twelfth street, between Second and
Third avenues." ,,"â '.
. It was shortly, after 2 o'clock "that
the pedestrian encountered the high
wayman, who suddenly appeared in
front of Duarte from the shadow of
trees that line the sidewalk. The foot
pad leveled a â  pistol at the surprised
man and ordered him to throw up his
hands. Duarte threw up his ' hands,
but . instead of submitting quiet
ly to being searched' the' victim grap
pled with the robber, knocked his pis
tol out of his hands and fought with
all of "his . might. â¢ Jyj
The men hammered away for a few
minutes, until the footpad managed
to free himself from his plucky antag
onist, grabbed his pistol and run.
Duarte ma'de no attempt to pursue the
fleeing highwayman, being satisfied to
have balked the thief In his attempt to
get money. As soon as Duarte arrived
at home he. reported the scrimmage to
the police, and gave a fair description
of his assailant. '
Detectives < Holland and Shorey took
up the investigation. They are satis
fied that Duarte's man was the same
single-handed prowler who held up R.
H. Bailey at 7 o'clock last evening and
robbed him. of. a. watch and $10 at
Nineteenth and Harrison streetB and

Educators who are interested In na

a conference on the subject in North
Hall/on the university grounds, yester
day morning. Addresses were made by
prominent members of the university
faculty and other teachers, and resolu
tions intended for, presentation to the
State Legislature were adopted. .
Among those who j spoke were Pro
fessor W. E. Hllgard, Professor Elmer
E. Brown, Professor W. J. V. Oater
hout and others. The resolutions adopt
ed declared it the sense of the confer
ence that provision should be made at
the Stats Universltv for a course of
special training designed : to prepare
Itinerant teachers of nature- study ag
riculture and subjects for their
work of instruction, and that an act
should be passed by the Legislature
providing for the appointment of com

bureau of Information with reference
to the teaching of nature study, under
the direction of the State University.
Professor Hilgard in his address re
ferred to the statement occasionally
made that too many things are now
sought to be crowded Into the common
school curriculum. He said that many
of these "too 'many things" were quite
unnecessary, and mentioned spelling aa
one of those that might give way to
nature study. He said the best results
In nature study would come from
actual contact with plant life, animal
life and geological subjects.

ALAMEDA, Dec. . 11.â With the close
of the present year more homes hav#
betn erected here than during any
year of the last decade, and local realty
dealers and builders expect that the
coming year will see the record of
1894, nearly one hundred and fifty resi
dences, surpassed. MUny of the local
realty dealers and contractors have
plans ready for new homes and are
waiting the close of the holiday season
before beginning work. There is a
steady. and increasing demand for mod
ern cottages of six and seven rooms
that rent for from $20 to $25 a -month.
Concerning business .with the Alame
da Land Company, Frank N. Dodd of
that firm saiS: , '
We are experiencing an unprecedented, in
quiry from outsiders for Alameda real estate.
There Is a n>arked improvement in the condi
tion of the market. Many Investors and those
seeking homos are contemplating settling In
thin city. Many beautiful homes are now in
course of construction throughout Alameda, and
desirable building lots are daily becoming more
yalunblÂ«Â». Several cottages and flats are abcut
to be erected on Central avenue, near Chestnut
street. The 1 promised improvement In our. roads
and the completion of a beautiful new depot at
the narrow gauge terminus Is positive guaran
tee of a new system of electricity through our
streets.- Alameda will then surpass any city
of its size in the world. Investor*, speculators
or home seekers can makÂ« no mistake to pur
chase within the city limits, as the future of
fers us every encouragement and the accom
plishment of our mest sanguine, expectations.
The opportunities were never better than they
are at present. The realty market -is sound
and healthy. .',,.'
Hammond â¢& * Hammond report a
steady inquiry for cottages to rent and
they always have a waiting list of
those seeking to obtain a cozy home in
Alameda. This firm also reports that
because of the demand for modern con
veniences in residences many owners of
houses that have been built for some
years are making alterations to the
buildings to meet the -requirements of
tenants.
Charles Adams & Co. of Bay Station
have negotiated several important
transfers during the last few weeks
and oxpeot to be busy after New
Year's day.
William Dufour recently effected the
sal* of the large lot at the southeast
corner of Santa Clara avenue and Wil
low street to John J. Ormsby. j The
purchaser intends to build on the lot to
Satisfy the needs of the tenant. i.

COMPLETE TOUR
OF WATERSHEDS
Engineers Finish Inspection
of the Holdings of the
Bay Cities Water Company
ASSEMBLE MANY FACTS
Collect Data Upon Which a
Report Will Be Rendered
to Oakland City Council
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1016 Broadway, Dec. 11.
City Engineer F. C. Turner, A. M.
Hunt and J. B. Howells, composing
the board of engineers selected to in
spect the Bay Cities Water Company's
properties, have returned from their
tour of the watersheds from which the
company purposes to get a supply for
the city of Oakland. The engineers
spent four days traversing the hills
and valleys back of Mount Hamilton,
which form the basis of the Bay Cities'
water project.
The commission visited the dam and
reservoir sites, inspected the ridges and
the streams, took many observations
and collected a mass of data bearing
upon the engineering problems, the
sufficiency of supply and the character
of the country. Close attention was
given the conditions in the Santa Ysa
bel and the Arroyo del Valle sections,
these forming the two main arteries of
the company's holdings, so far as Oak
land's interests are concerned. Much
of the data was gathered for the pur
pose of comparisons with the figures
and statements that have been sub
mitted to the City Council by the Bay
Cities Water Company engineers.
The engineers worked into the water
sheds by wary of Smith Creek, coming
out through the Arroyo del Valle and
following the company's projected pipe
lines south of Llvermore.
Before a report will be ready for sub
mission to the City Council the engi
neers will check up all the company's
figures from their own observations to
ascertain whether the former are cor
rect. City Engineer Turner saJd to
day he was doubtful whether a report
could be prepared In less than two
weeks. Concerning the trip, Turner
said:
. In view of the fact that the board was ap
pointed to make a report to the City Council,
I am not at liberty to comment on what we
eaw 4urlngr our tour. The trip was a rough
one and at times we suffered considerably from
the cold, being compelled to camp out most of
the time. Nothing concerning the inspection
will be made public until the report has been
submitted to the City Council.

MARINE LEAGUE
OUTLINES PLAN
Not Bound to Any Single
Project for Rehabilitation
of American Shipping
SEEKING BEST METHOD
Legislation Will Be Sug
gested Along Lines Ke
garded as Most Feasible
CLEVELAND. Dec. 11.â The Mer
chant Marine League of the United
States has sent out a statement set
ting forth the views of the league in
its efforts to rehabilitate the mer
chant marine of the United States. In
part the statement explains that the
purposes of forming thl3 league were
broadly stated in the resolutions
adopted at its formation. The senti
ment of the people at large will con
trol, and the more interest taken ihe
more nearly correct must be that
sentiment.
The decadence of our foreign
marine is a fact recognized In political
platforms and variously on all hands.
The evils are so apparent as to call
only for emphasis by considering de
tail.
Two things go hand in hand: A
merchant marine sufficient to prevent
undue dependence on foreign help,
a navy adequate in time of peace to
furnish the assurance,, and, where
necessary, the fact of protection to our
commerce and our ships and goods en
gaged in it and their terminals.
The Merchant Marine League of the
fa'nlted States, not in anywise or in
any degree whatsoever wedded to a spe
cific method or Involved in or with
any particular Interest, seeks to aid
in accomplishing this result upon
lines and by methods which shall
alike be creditable to us as a nation
and Include the greatest justice and
general good. How shall this be
done? Several methods of dealing
with the question have been brought
forward from time to time. The most
prominent are, perhaps, subsidy, dis
criminating duties, bounties or sub
ventions simply, postal subsidy or sub
vention, tonnage tax from which to se
cure a fund providing subvention.
The suggestion is permissible that,
without endeavoring in a servile man
ner to harmonize* Incongruous ele
ments, it should be possible to settle
upon what seems best of the various
plans and thereupon formulate a bill
which will at least get the matter
started.
C. E. Goldsmith, the engraver nf *6
Geary street,' Is now with Santwrn. Va.il
& Co. He has charge of the engraving
of wedding invitations, visiting cards,
announcements, etc. Mr. Goldsmith's
presence at Sanborn-Vail's Insures a
continuance of the very best work that
the engraver's art produces. Prices al
ways right. _ â¢ . .

may have been fractured.

Fushimi, Kinsman of the

Views Upon America!
MAKVELS AT OUR THRIFT
Member of Japanese Eoyal'
Family Is Eeturning to San |
Francisco En Route Home ;
Special Dispatch to The Call
NEW YORK. Dec. 11.â Before leaving
this country to return to Japan, Prince
Pushimi made known to-night his
views upon America. He will leave on
Tuesday morning, will stop in Chicago
for a day and will then hasten to San
Francisco to sail for Japan.
The Prince has visited the big steel
plants in Pennsylvania and observed
with keenest interest the capacity of
some of the works for turning out big
guns and general, accoutrements of
war. He has studied the American
agricultural situation and was aston
ished at the enormous supply for home
consumption and for export abroad.
Of all things in this country. , that
which impressed the Prince most was
the "intensified activity of commercial
life," as indicated by the complete
transformation of New York City since
he was here last. .
â¢ "You can say for the Prince," said
his personal representative, Mr. Sato,
"that he was simply amazed to find
New York City such a splendid arena
of commercial forces. He would never
have dreamed he had returned to the
New York City of twenty years ago
had he awakened here unawares. The
commercial activity of the entire coun
try astounds him. The amount of busi
ness that Is going on here and the
wonderful way in which it is being
done- have impressed his Highness in
a way which he cannot express."
.It was a pleasing sight when dozens
of the. Prince's fellow countrymen, re
siding in New York, passed before him
to-day at the St. Regis, bowed and
muttered in tones of reverence their
respect for the Mikado's kinsman.
Borne were young men who have not
yet gained a footing in America's busi
ness world and their dress was not of
the finest. But their love for Japan
shone in their faces and in every ges
ture and they appeared to feel at home
with the Prince.
Marble Nearly Discharged.
The British bark Lynton. lying at Beale
street wharf, has nearly discharged her cargo
of Italian marble. Among the cargo were come
magnificent pieces of stone. The largest block
weighed seventeen tons, and was one of the
purest pieces of Genoa marble ever brought to
this coast. There were also some superb elabs
of marble of the most exquisite quality. . It
took three months to load the ship at Genoa.
Owing to the dead weight of this cargo the
vesfel. brought but 1SC0 tons, whereas her car
rying capacity Is 3740 tons.

MONDAY DECEMBER 12, 1904
A SENSATIONAL BUSINESS WEEK.
THE feature in business last week was the sensational break in
Wall-street stocks. While the leading and conservative in
terests were not willing to admit that Thomas Lawson of copper
conflict notoriety was the prime cause of the momentary panic and
rather ascribed it to the overbought condition of the stock market
and the trepidation occasioned by the Presidents recommendation
in his message that the Interstate Commerce Commission fix freight
rates whenever necessary, it is undeniable that Lawson was the
chief instigator of the break. He publicly announced several days
prior thereto that he would cause a commotion in the market and
even set specific days for the disturbance ; and as it appeared on time
it is reasonable to believe that he was the arch market-breaker.
All interests agreed, however, that the panic was not caused
by any unfavorable conditions in the business of the country, which
are as sound as at any time during the past five or six years;
and the fact that it did not last but a day and a half and that the
market took a turn upward again affirmed this opinion. Since the
great decline the feeling has been much stronger and the speculative
atmosphere clearer, and the market is no worse oft than before the
squall. â¢
But it was very sensational during that day and a half, the
break being about twenty-two points in copper, while sugar also
declined sharply. But steel, which was also menaced by the raiders,
showed a comparatively light decline, which was an excellent ad
vertisement of the improved conditions in this industry, which have
been steadily growing better for se\-eral months. In fact, a year ago
the output of all the furnaces and mills of the United States Steel
Corporation ranged from 18,000 to 23,000 tons daily, whereas it is
now iti excess of 60,000 tons daily, and on one day recently it was
89.000 ton*.
Another conspicuous staple at present is cotton. Recently the
Government report, announcing a crop of over 12,000.000 bale-,
stampeded the market and demoralized the cotton and yarn milling
trades and started a general selling movement, which broke tbo
market. Since then, however, a firmer feeling has developed, and
the quotations have been showing a recovery. The crop is the
largest ever produced, and while it will probably cause lower prices
for cotton fabrics it will also increase the earnings of Southern
railroads, swell the exports and draw a largely increased revenue
from foreign countries, hence it is rather a great benefit than a detri
ment to the cotton industry;. With the large corn, cotton and hay
crops, to say nothing of the bounteous production of minor products,
the country will have an immense line of produce to sell at home
and abroad during the coming year, and this means nothing les~
than continued prosperity. Secretary WiJ^on of the Department of
Agriculture tefls us that our cotton crop will reach a value of
S6oo,ooo,ooo. our corn crop a value of Si. 000.000.000, our wheat and
hay crops a value of $1,000,000,000 and all our farm products com
bined a total value of $4,900,000,000. compared with $4480,000,000
last year. This is an increase of $420,000,000, or nearly 10 per cent,
in the value of our agricultural products within one year.
General conditions continue brilliant and full of promise. The
current expansion in business is shown by the continuous increase
in the bank clearing*, which last week showed .a gain of 55.6 per
cent over the same week last year, and in this respect the week was
a record breaker, as only two cities, and these of minor importance â
Memphis and Salt Lake City â out of the first fifty on the list showed
a loss. It is doubtful if the country's clearings ever before made
such a brilliant showing. Some of the gains were extremely large,
that of New York being 73.8 per cent, Boston 24.7 per cent,-Phila
delphia 79.1 per cent. Pittsburg 40.2 per cent. Baltimore 60.7 -per
cent, Minneapolis 43.6 per cent, and so on. These figures tell the
story of the country's remarkable prosperity. Of course, the heavy
increase in Xew York was largely due to the immense dealings on
the Stock Exchange, but those of the other cities were not, being the
legitimate results of a greatly expanded business all over the
countrv.
The abundance of money is shown by the continued low rates
of interest in Xew York. Even at the most "frenzied" moments of
the stock panic the rate for call money did not rise over 5 per cent
as the extreme top, and the ruling rates of the week were 3 to 4 per
cent. This speaks volumes for the country's unprecedented cash re
sources when it is remembered that at this time of the year call
money always goes up in Xew York, and only several, years ago.
when there was not the slightest question of the soundness of trade,
it soared up on one occasion to 40 per cent. What better evidence of
prosperity could be desired?
Otherwise there is little to be said. All sections of the country
report a fine demand for holiday goods, increasing activity among
manufacturing plants and railroad earnings in November 9.26 per
cent larger than for the same month in 1903, with freight blockades
at many points. A column could be written in enumerating the lines
of trade exhibiting increased activity, but those mentioned here will
do. The country was never more prosperous than at present.
ft OUR POSTAL COMMUNICATIONS.
ANY suggestion Â£or the improvement of the postal convenience?
of San Francisco, such as that for the establishment of pneu
matic tubes, ought to receive the most earnest and the most
speedy consideration. Facility of communication is an essential lu
bricant for the -wheels of commercial life, and its need becomes
more pressing with every increase of trade. Many European cities
already surpass us in the rapidity and ease with which their various
sections are placed in touch with one another and San Francisco
at least ought to see to it that the position is reversed. The Paris
postal authorities' for example, undertake to deliver a written com
munication to any address in the city within a very few minutes,
and at a very small charge, and this incalculable convenience hi
maintained by means of pneumatic tubes. Why should not San

BOLDNESS
OF THORPE
BY T. BLfilR EATON.
HE early frosts had done theii
Twork thorough!*-, and on either
side of tfie road the trees flaunted
gorgeous habiliments of gold and
Karlet.
As Thorpe, with his hands
thrust deep into his trousers pockets
and a briar pipe of honorable age be
tween his teeth, strode along the road
in the mellow sunshine of early after
noon, he hummed say arias and
thanked his sfars that he was alive-
He laughed boyishly when a startled
chipmunk scampered nimbly across his
path, and, from the safe seclusion of a
friendly maple, berated the intruder
roundly in a shrill chatter; he took
an imaginary shot at a partridge
which rose abruptly from a clump of
bushes; he sent a mocking challenge
to a flock of honking geese winging
their way southward.
Presently he came upon a fallen tree
lying invitingly by the roadside.
Thorpe accepted the tacit invitation,
and, seating himself upon the log, had
become engrossed in a friendly quarrel
between two belated blackbirds, when
he hÂ»ard the clatter of hoofs and the
rattle of wheels comins down the road.
He peered cautiously around a bar
berry bush which obstructed his range
of vision, and beheld a trap approach
ing smartly. On the elevated driving
seat was a girl, correct in every detail
of her "park form," and beside her,
looking decidedly stunted bv reason
of his much lower scat, was a trim,
faultless and impassive groom.
Thorp* chuckled delightedly.
"By George!" he said, rising and
sneaking behind the barberry bush.
"By George!"
When the turnout reached his re
treat Thorpe sprang from the bushes
and caught the hors* by the bridle.
"Stand and deliver:" he cried, wav
ing the ancient briar menacingly, si
The onslaught was so sudden that
the girl gave, a little squeal of alarm,
which sh? Instantly tried to cover with
a nervous laugh, while the groom en
deavcred to atone for the momentary
unfolding of his arms by a magnificent
outward calm and an intent scrutiny
of the distant landscape.
"Oh, so it's only you, after all," said
th* girl, smiling down at him com?
posf-dly from, the el?vatÂ«?d seat.
"Only me!" he exclaimed. "Now,
see here, I imagined I was a very
terrifying personality in my Claude
Duval role. I'm disappointed. You've
hur,t my feelings by not displaying
proper alarm."
The girl laughed.
"Well, sir. kindly notice I'm stand
ing. Now, what would you have me
deliver?" she asked.
Thorpe dropped the bridle and came
round, to the side of tbe trap.
"I think I'll be satisfied with a ride
back to town," he said.
The girl raised her eyebrows.
"I don't see where we can stow
you," she objected. ."â 
"I think Haskins needs exercise."
said Thorpe, eyeing the groom critical
ly and favoring that worthy with a
meaning' wink. "He's beginning to
show flesh. Xow, a walk back to
town this af ternon would be the very
thing for him. Eh, Haskins, don't
you think so?"
Thorp* thrust his hand into his
pocket in a manner whose meaning
could not be mistaken, whereat ths
grinning Haskins sprang out with
alacrity.
"Yes. sir. Quite likely, sir." he said
as he began with much ostentation to
tighten a girth.
Thorpe slipped a coin into the
groom's hand and climbed into the
cart. \ ,
"Drive on," he commanded the girl
in stentorian tones.
"Toil certainly are a bold highway
man," she said. "I suppose I must
obey." v
"My temper is uncertain," he remind
ed her. K
The girl flicked the cob lightly with
the whip and they sped down the
road. Thorpe suddenly gathered the
reins into his own hands and headed
the cob in the opposite direction.
"That # Isn't the way to town," the
girl obs'erved.
"I know it," Thorpe returned calm
ly. "Had you any idea'l wanted to re
turn to town at once?"
"You said you wanted a ride* '- back
to town," she reminded him.
"I did, I'll admit." said he. "but I
didn't say I desired to take the direct
read there." ' t ,.'
"Well, where are you going?"- =she
apked.
BITS OF EARLY MORNING MERRIMENT
HE KNEW.
His Mammaâ Gcorgle, you , must' use
your right hand.- :I don't want you to
become left-handed.
Georgie â Why, mamma, some of the
best pitchers on the diamond are left
handed. ' ' ' '
Thorpe smiled guardedly.
"I intend, with your assistance.", he
announced,' "to -drive to Paradise."
"What?" she gasped. *
Thorpe's grnile broadened- *"
"It may bs far; it may be near." he
said, musingly. "But that it lies some
where along this road I am foolishly
confident."
"What on earth are ybu talking
*?â¢ .â¢,
"Stand and deliver,"' he
cried.
about? 8 she asked in amazement.
â  "It has long .-been conceded by
thoughtful theologians," said Thorpe,
oraculariy. "that Paradise is a state
rather than a place- I expect to enter
that felicitous state when you say
you'll marry me, Nan. and I expect
you to furnish ' me with admission
somewhere along this road. Am I
wrong in being optimistic?"
The girl surveyed the flaming autumn
colors in silence for a time.
"Suppose," she said at length, "that
â that I say you are wrong?"
Thorpe brought the cob to a stop.
"I shall get out and walk to â well,
rot Paradise," he sa!d.
The girl said nothing, and Thorpe
moved uneasily.
"Shall I wa!k?" he said.
"You'd â you'd better keep to the
original quest, it seems to me," she
said In low tones.
Thorpe passed her the reins and
laughed lightheartedly.
"Drive anywhere you wish," he said
generously.- "You can't take me out of
Paradise now."

Campaign Comparisons.
When Lincoln was re-elected in 1864
only about $200,000 was spent by the
national committee in the Presidential
campaign. The national committees
this year, it is estimated, have dis
bursed a total of J5.000.000 in electing a
President. â¢ Comparisons are orover
bfally odious, but these figures are so
widely apart that the analytical mind
cannot help carrying the comparison
further and noting the difference be
tween candidates also. If a Lincoln
cost the country a couple of hundred
thousand and a Parker or a Roosevelt
five millions, what twill be the cost of
the chief executive of 1944? For the
sake of Uncle Sam's pocket it is to be
hoped that there will be a slump in the
Presidential market by that time.
Deepest Gold Mine.
The deepest gold mine in the vorll is
said to be at Bendlgb, Australia. It is
called the New Chum Mine, and Us
main shaft is sunk to a depth of three
thousand nine hundred feet, or only
sixty feet short of thrge-quarters of a
mile. The most difficult problem of
working a mir.e of such a depth is how
to keen the tunnels and general work
ings cool enough for the minors to
work. The temperature is usually about
108 degrees, and this Is, of course, ter
ribly enervating. To make it possible
for the men to work' at all a spray of
cold water is let down from above and
kept continually playing on their

How little we know of the people
about us. We see them, not as they
really are. but as our own experience
fits us to see them. To untried youth
the night-watch of a sorrowing soul
may look like midnight revelry. It is
only despair which teaches one the
value of a laugh, the futility of tears.
The act of observing the people
about you with the view of penetrat
ing the secret romance of their lives is
in more respects trfan the obvious one.
like reading a no*^?l. When you read
a book what is it that you gain? Do
yoji get the fullness of the writer's
thought? You have his words, and
what they mean to. you; but that i3
all you have. What they meant to
him who wrote them it is beyond your
power even to know.
Just so with the human document.
When you have closed this book, what
have you that you did not have be
fore? Have you the facts cf anoth
er's life? Yes. possibly you have the
facts, but they do not necessarily con
stitute the truth about the one whom
you have betn studying. The only
truth that you have gained is that
which, in your interpretation of an
other's acts and motives, you have dug
out of your own souL
This is the reason why we worne'R
judge a man by his capacity for lor
ing. Love is our natural life, and de
termines, therefore, our standard of
value. In our eyes the man who. by
word or act, refuses to recognize the
power of iove, dwarfs his own propor
tione. We feel that his inherent egot
ism, which wa3 certainly meant by his
Creator to carry him toward the goal
of his desires, is like a loose sail flap
ping in the wind, retarding his prog
ress, instead of helping him onward.
Of course, in taking this view of
things we are not reading men; we are
reading ourselves. Whv men are thus
and so it is beyond a woman's power
to fathom. She can see in the men
about her qualities that she herself pos
sesses. She can interpret their acts by
the' effect that they have upon her
own life. She can perceive the influ
ence of her own personality in the pow
er that she has for good or evil. It Is
her right â the grift alike of instinct and
cf logic â to believe in a masculine
strength, which is the complement of
her feminine weakness. Beyond thiB
point she cannot go by any arts of
divination which heaven has given her.
A reader of these articles has written
to me that he thinks that I am gen
erous to men. I trust that no one of
you will think that I am ungenerous
to women when I say that I think the
responsibilities of the world they live in
rests mainlv on their shoulders. .They
set the fashion in love as as in
morals' For many of the failings of
men the women have only themselves
to blame. They have been too wasteful
cf their heritage and too careless of
their privileges.
It is as the English moralist declares
â the buckling on of a knight's armor
by his lady's hand in days of old means
more to us than a mere caprice of ro
mantic fashion. Rather it is the type
of an eternal truthâ "that the so'ul's
armor is nsver well set to the heart
unless a woman's hand has braced it;
and It is only when she braces it loose
ly that the honor of manhood fails."
A Kcul Hatpin.
It is claimed that at last a hat pin
has been invented. The so called hat
pins are mere anchors that are drag
ged off when the wind blotvs, and It is
at that time that they are needed.
This hat pin is said to be one that
will actually hold a hat en a woman's
head. It is made in such a way that
a sort of safety pin is pinned inside
the hat: through this run three blunt
prongs, resembling hair pins. These
prongs are run through pins placed at
each side of the hat. They are fast
ened through the hat by a pin with an
ornamental head, a pearl, a flower or
some simple design.
The pir.s hold the hat securely, so it
is said, and do not make unsightly
holes -in the braid or hat material. y

A CURE FOR "NERVES." '
SUCH IS A PHYSICIAN'S OPINION
Monotony and Repression Thus Relieved
BY LACKA BRIDE POWERS.
"As a cure for feminine nerves, I
know of nothing more effective than
y omen's clubs â the active type of wom
en's clubs" â so saith a thoughtful
medical man, and his declaration pro
claimed him a man of perspicacity far
beyond his sex.
Of a truth. -women's clubs serve a&
exhaust-pipes for Teminine energyâ
likewise as supply-pipes for such as
nted mental infusion. In clubs of
whatever type, be they cultured or so
cial or civic, there is something for
each woman to do, and it is in the do
-â¢g â the mental excitation caused by
the new, exhilarating dutiesâ that
physicians are at last finding a cure
"for their patients with "nerves."' The
theory is that, in proportion to the
forgetfulness of selfâ in exhilarationâ
be it in work . or play â do the nerves
recover their tensity, and the mind its
perspective. Then comes harmony,
then content, then health â and never a
box of pills in eight.
Monotony is the poison that is eat
ing out the lives of women, and par
ticularly of women of San Francisco,
v'here the cl!rpatic*and economic con
ditions conduce to nervous tenslonl
.Here repression becomes necessary, and
iJ. is this long, unbroken repression â
without ventilation â that is causing
the tragedies that the newsmongers re
j)urt at each day's dawn. Monotony and
repression â these are the diseases that
prey upon the vitality of women, and
which in time consume it with the
greed of a vampire.
And now, at last, comes a wise old
doctor, who doesn't prescribe a "trip
to the country," a pound or two of
strychnine, or a rest cure, with its vil
lainies, for his women patients with
"nerves," but he tells thÂ«>m to "join a
club â one whose work is of direct ln
t*-reÂ»t to them," and to work in it with
a will. The absorption therein is to do
the rest â and the strangest part of it
all is that the scheme really works, un
like many medical schemes that ought
to. but don't.
. And herein lies a new use for our
fast growing clubs, of which there are
cow in the city 446, with S000 members.
Fellow club women, methinks that
rtjedical gentleman â the wise man of his
â¢Cay and generation â Is a fit fellow for a
toast at the next State federation. Any
rnan with discernment enough to recog
nize the necefsity for mental and social
stimulus among women is a public
benefector, likewise a prophetâthere
tem let us honor him.

KOPTA CONCERT
PLEASES LOVERS
OF GOOD MUSIC
A fair audience gathered to hear
the third of the Kopta Quartet con
certs yesterday afternoon at Lyric
Hall anoLseemed heartily to. enjoy the
interesting matter presented. The
audiences at these concerts, by the
way, are *iot what they should be as
to. number. Musically, they are all
they should be, for the musicians are
always there in their 'faithful scores.
But the music lovers, the students to
whom chamber music as well done as
it is done by the Kopta people should
especially appeal, are in a rather ab
surd minority. Perhaps It is not whol
ly their fault. The concerts are oij*y
modestly advertised. Still, it is the
student and music lover's duty to'be
come aware of such things, knowing
that they are not. of the blllboarded
variety of entertainment. And the
series can be most heartily recom
mended. At each concert some new
work of significance Is presented, and
some of the. classics revived, and al
ways worthily.
Yesterday afternoon the head and
front of the programme was ' the
beautiful Schumann'' quartet op. 41,
No. 1. To hear only the adagio was
worth going through yesterday's fog
for. Perhaps Mr. Kopta was a little
Inclined to hasten its Greek flow,
which, with the truer pulse of' the
'cello, slightly confused the measure,
but, on the whole, it was charmingly
played. The' other movements were,
all given with nice sympathy, the hu
morous imitations in the finale coming
with particular precision and fluency.
Arensky, in the piano quintet op.
51, furnished the afternoon's novelty.
Special color, either racial or per
sonal, one does not find in much evi
dence, here. The work Is essentially
modern, in form rather remarkable
for the length of the scherzo and the
shortness of the finale. 1 - Best, per
ha"ps, of its* four movements are the
variations, of them the theme, broad,
distinctive and very gratefully har
monized. Schumann is slightly sug
gested in the treatment of the varia
tions, and there, are many charming
moments. The scherzo is clever In
the French fashion, piquant, â¢ "slick"
and a little obvious. One needs more
than one hearing of the opening al
legro. A ponderous and rather con
fused movement It appears, dramatic
and colorful however, but lacking
definition.^ In addition, it was less
well played than the rest, in which
the players gave ' admirable account
of themselves. Mrs. Mansfeldt, nota
bly In some solo passages of the an
danta, was her most sympathetic and
discreet self. The other movements
were an adagio of Lachner's and the
Cherubini scherzo from the first quar
tet. - BLANCHE PARTINGTON.

"HE SAVED MT LIFE" LAST WEEK.â
Through eating tainted meat I suffered the
most awful, excruciating torments from
PTOMAINE POISONING. Every moment
seemed as if It would be my LAST. I
writhed In exquisite anguish all . the time.
â¢ There â  was constant violent vomiting and
purging, with inconceivable, Intolerable tor-
ture all over my body, especially In stom-
ach and bowels. I felt I must surely DIB
unless speedily helped, but nothing relieved
me In the least. I was collapsing from the
' most cruel a conies and exhaustion. Then
came Rexradlo, whse "first" treatment (In-
stantly) gave me extraordinary relief. It was
- like passing from hell to heaven. The second
treatment fully and permanently stopped all
the dreadful pains, vomiting and purging,
with no return since. That night I slept
soundly and ever since have felt like a new
man, entirely painless, easy and hearty, and
able as usual to attend to my business. I
cannot Speak too highly of Rexradlo and his
truly "marvelous" humanized radium treat-
ment, which 1 earnestly recommend to all
sufferers. Before I was a "skeptic." but now
Rexradlo has not a more entnuslastic grate-
ful advocate than' I am. He healed me as
If by magic, and undoubtedly saved my
life. Call on me any time.â Richard J,

PAPER FAVORS
BRUTE FORCE
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LONDON, Dec. 11.â "The Brutallta
rian" has Just made its 'appearance.
It calls Itself a "Journal for the Sage
and Strong," and its policy is embodied
in this rather surprising text: "We
have let brutality die out too much."
"The Brutalitarlan's" editor Is, in
fact, in favor of severity in almost
every form and corporal punishment
strikes him as one of the most salu
tary of these, especially flogging.
"If is from flogging," he says in his
introductory article, "that the English
man has developed that toughness of
fibre and splendid moral â  standard
which is the wonder of an envious
world; and shall all this be cast aside
as if it were nothing, because a few
sickly, neurotic humanitarians are
averse to the infliction of physical
pain?"
The editor thinks that women ought
to be flogged as well as men, but he is
true to his creed in defending them for
wearing the plumage of birds in their
hats. He advocates war and quotes a
certain . British statesman, who de
scribed It as a "magnificent game." He
is also in favor of whipping in schools.
' "Caning," he says, "is to all Intents
and purposes a surgical operation, the
spectator feeling the same pleasure in
witnessing it that the medical student
feels while looking on in the clinic."
"The Brutalltarian" is made up of
four pages and is not much different
in appearance from the ordinary peri
odical. There Is nothing about it, in
fact, aside from its title and the re
markable nature of the text to indicate
that it is not intended to be taken with
all gravity.
S. R. Crockett, who .wrote, the
"Stickit Minister," has spent the sum
mer with his family in Switzerland.
He came back to London recently, how
ever, for the purpose of seeing his new
story, "The Loves of Miss Anne,"
through the press, * but now has re
turned home to Scotland.
Few British writers are busier Just
at present than Madame Albanesi, who
gave us "Susannah and One Elder,"
and whose new novel, "Capricious Car
oline," has Just been published. She
recently disposed of one serial story,
and. is now at work on another, which
has been commissioned by the London
weekly, the Queen," and the first install
ment of which will appear In January.
Madame Albanesi is also working on a
series of short stories and one of arti
cles on society, both of which have
been ordered in advance.
Unless Robert Hichens Is uncommon
ly hard to please he must be feeling
rather well satisfied with life Just at
present. He is enjoying a phenomenal
run of luck, which really began last
year, when his "Woman With the Fan"
made so big a hit. That romance Is
still selling, and reports from the Unit
ed States indicate that the adaptation
which HichenB made recently of the
French play, "Business is Business,"
has also proved a money-maker in the
hands of William H. Crane. George
Alexander is about to produce the piece
In this country, so Hichens will soon be
getting royalties on It from both sides
of the water. And, to make the thing
complete, Hichens' new novel, "The
Garden of Allah," is getting really en
thusiastic notices on all sides and prom
ises to be one of the best sellers of the
season.
That Is a fairly good showing for a
writer whose belief in his literary pow
ers was so shaky to start with that he
did not feel like trusting to his pen for
the proverbial bread, butter and occa
sional jam. When he left college Hich
ens believed, in spite of vague hanker
ings to write, that music was his forte,
and he set about studying it forthwith,
first in Bristol and then in London. But
all the time he kept on wanting to
write and before long surrendered to
the craving and began to vary the mo
notony of studying harmony, compos-

lngr lyrics and playing the" organ by
writing short stories and working inter
mittently on a blood-curdling romance
called "The Coastguard's Secret."
This romance pot published after a
while, and it is one of the hopes of
Robert Hichens' life that no" one will
ever resurrect it. In the meantime,
however, editors sent back his short
stories with unflattering promptitude.
Perhaps that putHhe young author's
back up. Anyhow, he made up his
mind definitely that he was going to
be a writer, and instead of devoting
any more time to music study enrolled
himself among the other aspirants in
a certain "school of Journalism" sit
uated in London. By Hichens' liter
ary acquaintances the belief is held
that he has succeeded in turning him
self into a successful author in spite
of the "school of. Journalism," rather
than because of it.
The thing was not . long in coming
about, however. The sale of the Coast
guard story, which he is now so anx
ious to forget, was his first stroke of
luck, and only a few months afterward
he published the novel that set every
one talking about him, "The Green
Carnation." Since then, he has turned
out novels at the rate of one a year.
He Is an odd mixture of society man
and Bohemian, and spends his time
about equally between London and the
Continentâ having bachelor chambers
in Mayfair and a villa on Lake Como.
His years number forty. He stands
about 5 feet eight or ten, and training
with Sandow has given him a figure
of unusual erectness. He has dark
hair and eyes, a short, black mus
tache and a chin almost as firm as
Chamberlain's.

16 Pages. $1 perYeapTHRONGS AT THE TRAINING QUARTERS OF BRITT AND NELSON
NELSON EXPECTS TO WIN
INSIDE OF TWELVE ROUNDS
Fighter From Copenhagen Sends, Message to Chlcaao
Mixes It Fiercely in
His Training at
Larkspur.
Battling Nelson, or, as he was chris
tened, Oscar Battling Matthew Nelson,
la far away Copenhagen, where he was
bom in 1?S2, has sent word to his
friends in Chicago that he expects to
defeat Jimmy Britt in twelve rounds.
â He says he predicted the defeat of
Young' Corbett and was never so sure
of anything: in his life as that he will
defeat Britt.
Nelfun is one ef a family of ten chil
dren and came to this country with
his oarents when he was ten months
old. They lived for a time in Chicago
and then moved to Hegewisch, a sub
urb of the Windy City, where large
machine shopi are located. Two of
the brothers are machinists. Battling
was a. machinist's helper at one time,
lie was nearly killed by a fragment
of iron from a broken machine. He lay
unconscious in a hospital for two days.
When he came out he had a distinct
aversion to the calling of a machin
ists helper.
When urged not to take up pugilism
he had an unanswerable argument for
his critics: "If I run such'risks in the
shops, how can fighting be more dan
jrerous?" \ r I :-""
Battling enlisted in the volunteers in
l^S from Huron, S. D., but the ser
vices of the little company were not
required and It disbanded without its
members seeing any warfare. Nelson's
fiist ring battles were preliminary af
fairs about Chicago, where the 130
j.-under took on men of any weight,
f â ivietimcs giving away thirty pounds
it more.
Th- betting men are already figuring
on the Britt-Xelson fight. It is the
consensus of opinion that the Britt-
Gacs affair and the Nelson. Corbett
tisht must be left out of the calcula
tions. From Gens' own statements he
did not show his true form, whatever
it might have been. Young. Corbett
v.as not in form, although he made
both himself and his friends believe he
v.as on the eve of the battle.
Nelson is such a plodding fighter that
h*> docs not show the class' that Britt
and others show. If he can win from
Britt it will demonstrate how decep
tive appearances are. as the Califor
r.ian has all the dash and brilliancy of
the most finished boxer.
The usual Sunday delegation of
sporting men crowded Smiling Metz
r.or's tavern at Larkspur yesterday to
watch Nt-teon work for his battle with
Britt. Those who journeyed across the
pond were griven a rare treat, as Bat
w*nt twelve hot rounds in all with
Eddie Santry, Stockings Kelly and a
youns amateur from Milwaukee. The
J.'.utÂ«= were of the furious kind and
mnch blood was shed. The Dane seems
to train steadily in speed and appears
in fine condition. An hour's regular
pymnafium work preceded the boxing.
Hat did not go on the road in the morn
ing- on account of the muddy condition
Â«f the roads. He tipped the beam dur
irc- fhÂ» afternoon three pounds over
xrelght. He could readily dispose of
several pounds more if necessary.
CROWD SEES BRITT TRAIX.
Plumber Boy Does a Hard Day's
Work at the Beach.
All sorts and conditions of men and
women vied with one another in a
feverish desire to gain access to
Jimmy Britt's training boudoir yes
terday afternoon at the beach. Only
a favored few, however, were admitted
within the sacred precincts of the
gymnasium and the rest had to be
Fatisfied with a glimpse of the plum
ber boy as he dipped in the waters of
the blue ocean after his day's work
v.as done. *":
James put In an .extra hard day.
Perhaps it was the admiring throng
v.hich spurred him on or It may have
been a sense of duty with him, but
at any rate he punched and tussled
and pranced around that gymnasium
In such a lively manner that the spec
tators frequently applauded his efforts
with rounds of hearty applause. .Ti. >
"Spider** Kelly was there with his
hapijy raiment and he seemed to.ap
prove of every move Jimmy made. He
"went through his usual stunts, besides
dcir.g a lot of shadow boxing and toss
ins the medicine ball with "Tly" Krel-
Jng:. Jimmy looks just about ready
now, although he says some more
training won't do him any harp.
- Frank Rafael had to go same when
he donned the big mitts. It was rush
and breakaway as best you could in
each of the four rounds. Britt took
nearly as many wallops as he landed
and the more he was hit the harder
he went. Without hesitating at all
he did some dumbbell work and
rhadow boxing and then engaged Krel
ir.g in that usual tedious period of
roughing and wrestling.
.Britt will work faster and harder
from now on till the day before the
light. He will try out ambitious
youths when he feels so inclined and
Jf nothing serious happens should ap
pear at his best on the 20th Inst.
Soldiers Make Good Score*.
The members of Company G. First

VAMPIRES TIE
WITH HORNETS
Independents. Beat Eagles
and Albion Rovers Win
Easily From Pickwicks
The most interesting and most keenly
contested <rame of association football
that has been played during the present
season for the championship of the Cal
ifornia league took place yesterday aft
ernoon on the Alameda ground between
the Vampires and the Oakland Hor
nets. Neither side was able to score
against the other. J. Frew was referee,
and by his prompt decisions prevented
the game from becoming a rough one,
as would certainly have happened. with
a weaker referee.
The Hornet forward line played a
strong attacking game, but could not
pierce the defense of the Vampires. The
goalkeepers on both sides did their
work well, each stopping three certain
goals. The game was watched by a
large' crowd of spectators, who mani
fested keen interest in the players. The
teams lined up in the following order:

' The ground at Idora Park,. Oakland,
was occupied by the teams of the Al
bion Rovers and Pickwicks, with A. t>.
Couper as referee. It was exceedingly
slippery, being covered with long, wet
grass. In the first few minutes of play
Jennings of the Rovers, twisted his
knee and had to retire from the game.
Though the Rovers played with only
two halfbacks they succeeded in scor
ing six goals to the two made by the
Pickwicks. In the first period the Rov
ers scored two goals and the Pickwicks
one. In the second period the Rovers
scored four and the Pickwicks one.
Whyte, Bradley, Anderson, Bain and
McArthur scored for the winners, and
Inganni and Robertson for the losers.
The game was a somewhat argu
mentative one, the players showing a
disposition to "talk back" to the ref
eree. The teams occupied the following

by Quite a Margin.
- Track Gossip.
BY FRED E. MULHOLLAXD.
The prospects are for some excellent
Bport at Oakland racetrack this week,
as a fine programme has been ar
ranged. On Wednesday there will be
a handicap for' all ages at a mile and
seventy yards, with 51000 added. This
event should serve to bring together
some of the best hrorses here.
. The Crocker selling' stakes, which
will have a value of more than $3000,
is down for decision It is
for three-year-olds and upward at one
mile. Among the seventy-four eligl
bles are a number of high-class per
formers. The list includes Arcade,
Military Man, Elliott,- Vesuvian, Le
tola, Bombardier, Soufriere, The
Mighty, Modicum, Martinmas, Nl
grette. Gold Money, Captain Forsee,
San Nicholas, Andre\v\ B. Cook and
Ananias.
The Christmas handicap, with . $3000
added, will be run on Mondav, the 26th
inst. t
During the first twenty-five days of
the present season the New California
Jockey Club has distributed $67,dbo in
stakes and purses. Walter B. Jennings
heads the list of winning owners, with
$4920 to his credit.
James Hanbv pavs it was through
no fault of his that Mike Dalv was de
prived of the services of Dominick to
ride Claude in the handicap on Satur
day. According to the former's ver
sion of the controversy, Daly on Fri
day stated that Claude would not be
a ' starter in the race, whereupon
Hanby then secured the mount on
Gold Money for Dominick. Bullman
was once more on the "sick list, the
judges would not permit W. Daly to
accept the mount, so Claude was
scratched. ' 'r-^ / 1
Michaels should brush up in his rid
ing a little. Some of his waits are
longer than it is between cars on the
Geary-strÂ«el line.*
If Northwest can win easily with R.
Butler up, the filly was a pick-up at
$700. It would not be surprising to
see" her beat Dainty with a rider up.
So Ed Corrigan has gone on East
from Chicago' to enlist the services of
the Jockey Club in his fight against
the Western Jockey Club. If he is suc
cessful things must have changed
around some in old York State.
When Whoa Bill was pulled up
bleeding In Friday's race, the hemor
rhages some of the colt's backers were
seized with haven't been stopped yet.
Bookmaker Joe Rose - will probably,
cut in this week.V "^ '-'â¢'
Billy Cahill purchased Yada from
Sam Hildreth for $1000. The Odd Fel
low colt has a frictionless way of get
ting over the ground, and should pick
up many a purse before the season is
over. Billy deserves a good horse, any
way.

, of the Liveliest Contests
of the Year.
One of the liveliest games of Gaelic
football ever seen in this city was
played at the Presidio' Athletic
Grounds yesterday when the Parnell
team faced the Wolfe Tones. The field
was a cross between the San Bruno
marsh and a plate of mush, but the
players seemed to be amphibious."
In the, first half a bunch of Par
nells in green jerseys literally piled
through the Wolfe Tone~goal. It looked
all Parnell, at the beginning of the
second half, but the Wolfe Tones got
their second wind and became busy.
Almost' in the dark they went at the
boys in green hammer and tongs. The
game ended 4 to 3 in favor of the
Wolfe Tones.. The gate receipts will be
turned ; over to the language fund of
the Gaelic League. Following are the
players:

A CANARD!
Because my ONE-BEST-BET did not happen
to make a winning: â howln* for the week end-
Ins Saturday, a rumor spread about to-wn' Sat-
urday night that the bookmakers had reached
me. The story spread like thÂ« smell of fire,
and about dinner tlmÂ« waÂ» the main toplo of
conversation In thÂ« Palace Hotel Cafe, the
lobby of the St. Francis Hotel. Techau'a Tav-
ern, the- PoodlÂ« Dos, and other well- known
publlo placea where my client* ara wont to
j conerejrat*.
! If the silly Â«a| who originated the yarn
, had stopped to think, he would never havÂ«
i epruns it. There Is as much chance* of "Gen-
eral Jack." Hornaday being reached by thÂ«
bookmakers aa there l a for the mountain* to
come down out of the clouds or the rivers to
run back to their fountains. The story is
perfect moonshine, and, needless to add. Is all '
carved out of the carver's brain.
Eliminating all question of my honesty, how
much do you think the bookmakers could af-
â¢SF.SL 10 pay mo a " a brIb e? I am spending
?3000 per week In advertising alone, and 1
have over 500 clients residing in twenty States.
The racing season here !mik nearly six month*.
Do you think v they could afford to pension me
for that time at a price I would be expected
to aÂ«k? For surely I would lose my clients
so fast that my advertising would practically
be a dead low. And would they have any In-
centive to continue to pay me, when, after a
enort period of time, the number of my fol-
lowers had dwindled to a small and continually
declining number of listless playerm?
Think it over 1 . The only way I can makÂ»
money | a by furnishing wtnnera at good prices,
and the common enemy Is the bookmaker.
MY RECORD!
Again. If you look over ray record, which X
reproduce here in full this mornlnp. of every
norse given by me as my dally OXE-BEST-
BET since the beginning of the meeting, you
<wili find that only on* hone named by ma
last week out of six finished worse than aec-
ond; and that twice, in the cas* of MILITARY
MAN on Tuesday and CLAt/OB on Thursday,
I was nosed out of first money.
Again, if you consult my complete record
published below, you will find t^at every se-
lection that I have given sine? thÂ« beginning
of the meeting as my OXE-BEST-BET has
been backed down at the track. If I were In
league with the bookmakers and was touting
my clients daily on a "stiff* the price would
to sailing â wouldn't It? ' $. â 
How anybody but the rawest kind of a
"come on" could swallow that yarn Is beyond
me.
The story may owe Its origin to an Hl-con-
cealed attempt of the bookmakers themselves
to prepossess the public against the best tip-
ster that ever came over the pike. They cer-
tainly aren't in love with the man that haa
so successfully wasre<! war against them. For
over two decades, through thÂ» medium of such
well-known plungers as "Plfbbursr Phil," the
late William C. Whitney. Pteve 1'HommedJeu,
Riley Grannan. Dave Gideon, John Daly.
Jesse Lewisohn andyithers, I have consistently
and persistently "milked" them of the money
they have gathered from what Is currently
known amontr sports aa "sucker bettors." and
they have as much love for me aj an East-
erner has for a California fie*.
I admit that my OXE-BEST-BET record
last week was staiply rotten. I am ashamed
of it! It's the hummest looking showing I
have made since the days I clocked Longfel-
low in his morning workouts down in Lexing-
ton, and that was nearly a quarter of a cen-
turr aco. If I could not make that record
lrok like the froth on a glass of atale beer I
would quit touting and become a tamalo
vender.

JUfVfP ABOARD
The record which Is printed above had some
bad soots last week far flat bet players, but
for the system player It had no bad spots.
Ask the player of any system I don't^car*
what It is. whether he could not make a bar-
rel of money by playing a series of selections
that doesn't give more than three consecutive
losers, and. he will tell you that ha could wtn
all the money on the racÂ» track by progressive
bets on that kind of picking.
However, as Indicated In the foreword of
this advertisement. I can beat last week's
showing by a city block. It was the first week
out of four that a fiat bet made a losing. If
tbe bookmakers had a full Idea of what my
ONE-BEST-BET has in store for them every
day this week, they would all "take to the
tall and uncut." Mcst of them are filled with
apple Juice and conceit and will have on tap
to-day a hogshead of Dutch courage. The
prices that they will lay against my OXE-
BEST-BET will make your head swim. They
think they have got me beaten to a pulp.
But watch me cÂ»it loose!
And If you happen to be on the first Oak-
land boat to-night returning from the races,
after my OXE-BESTÂ»BET has landed, listen
to some of their conversationlngs. Then if
I you don't think a Umburser Cheese Factory
has exploded. I will present you with my wire
for the next thirty days gratis. .
Talk ebout your "Sleepers." The one I will
uncork this afternoon will come very near ap-
proachinr the famous coup that I pulled oft
at Saratoga in 1887 with Troubadour, when, as
every turfite know*. John Daly and I aklnned
the ring out of 141.000 bucks.
"For to-morrow I have got another onÂ» that

Xow, I don't cars how many of yon San
Francisco babies give my dally message the
go-by this week, because I happened to have
some losers last we?k. I c*n afford to wait;
and I don't have to do any coaxing I have
got the goods. I am practically selling $20

FINE EXERCISES
Golden jubilee literary exercises in
honor of the immaculate conception of
the Blessed yirgln Mary were held
yesterday by the Ladles' and Gentle
men's sodalities of St. Ignatius
Church in the college hall.
The programme waa admirably ar
ranged. It began with a splendid ren
dition of the march from "Aida" by
the St. Ignatius College orchestra,
James R. Kelly followed with an ad
dress, In which he told of the loyalty
of the members of the sodalities and
erpressed his pride in the fact that in
all the years of their organization
there had never been a case of a mem
ber doing anything inconsistent with
the high alms of the order.
Miss Mary Starkweather then re
cited a beautiful poem, entitled .'To
day." by Sister Anna Raphael, S. N.
D., and the ladies* and gentlemen's
choir sang "Maria Mater Gratiae," the
excellent voices blending well and giv
ing full value to the exquisite compo
sition. The choir was also heard in
"Tota Pulchra Es." and "Regina Sine
Ccncepta."
"She Shall Crush Thy Head" was
th* subject of a recitation by Miss
Cornelia Farrell, who threw remark
able feeling into the delivery. Fred
Churchill's delivery of "The Rising
Dawn" was also an able effort and
Miss Mary Inglis' "Ode" was spoken
â with all the gentleness the subject re
quired.
George A. Connolly gave a master
ful oration and the violin solo, "Capri
cietto," by Miss Blanche Coonan. ac
companied by his sister. Miss Coonan,
was one other of the many treats the
artistic programme afforded. .
The orchestra won laurels for its
rendering of "Angels Serenade"; the
intermezzo, "Naila" and the pastoral,
'Idlewllde." \ â ;'. Y ;.'
.The Rev. Father Biever, S. J., Â»of
New Orleans delivered a few remarks
before the 'close of the exercises, In
which he gave to the reverend tethers
of the college the heartiest congratu
lations for the strength and loyalty of
the sodalities.

nation Regarding Sudden
Disappearance of Money
Coupled with the sudden death of
John Brashland, a soldier, Saturday
afternoon comes the story of the mys
terious disappearance of $1540 which he
Is supposed to have had a few hours
before his death. The police are work
ing on the case, but have obtained no
clew as, to the sudden disappearance^of
the money.
Brashland died in the room of Thom- 1
as Harvey, an ex-soldler, at 2612 Lom
bard street. According to Harvey's
story the two were but slightly ac
quainted. He met Brashland outside
his house on Saturday afternoon, and
, Brashland asked him for liquor. Har
vey took the man into the house and
gave him some whisky. Later Harvey
went out and bought beer, and w^ille
returning with it met anotheiv soldier,
Frank Strosnider, whom he also invited
to come into his room and have a drink.
When they entered Brashland was ap
parently asleep in a chair. A glass of
beer was poured out for him and an
effort made to awaken him. His friends
found that he was not sleeping, but
was dead. The body was removed to
the Morgue, where an autopsy showed
that death was due to cirrhosis of the
liver coupled with heart disease.
Yesterday morning a report was
made to the police that Brashland had
a considerable sum of money In his pos
session just before his death, and an
investigation was accordingly begun.
It was found that on November 30 he
deposited $1600 with O. Weinhold, the
proprietor of one of the unlicensed sa
loons just outside the Presidio gates.
"Weinhold admits having received the
money, but has in his possession a re
ceipt showing that he paid over to
Brashland $1540 on Thursday. When in
terviewed he said:
"Brashland left $1600 with me on No
vember 30 for safe keeping, and be
tween that time and last Thursday
drew out or spent $60. When he asked
for his money I urged him not to* take
it, but he insisted on having it, saying
he was about to leave for Texas. He
also intimated that he had more money ]
on deposit elsewhere. I have no idea i
how he could have got rid of so much
money in such a short time. He left
my place saying he was going to the
Presidio, and as it was payday there it
is Just possible he may have lost the
money by gambling. My opinion is,
however, that he was held up and
robbed."
As Brashland was penniless when he
begged Harvey for a drink and made
no complaint of having been held up,
the robbery theory is hardly plausible.
Other friends say that he may have
left the money in care of one of the
o Rlcer? at the, Presidio, but If he did no
receipt for it was founa on his person.

ROSE MELVILLE STILL
CHARMS IN "SIS HOKINS"
Her Hoosier Girl Is Fumiy
IGNACE JAN PADEREWSKL THE
EMINENT POLISH PIANIST AND
COMPOSER. TO BE HERE.
"Sis Hopkins" came back to the Cali
fornia last night and by the size of the
audience has evidently not worn out
its welcome. Pretty Rose Melville, the
original "Sis," leads the cast and Is as
amusing as ever as the Hoosier girl.
Perhaps more so. That the audience
could have helped Sis along with most
of her quaint sayings did not seem to
make "there ain't no use in doing noth
ing for nobody that never done noth
ing for you," and the rest, any the less
funny. They seemed to like it better
that way. And Miss Melville, pigtails,
sunbonnet and all, is very entertain
ing in her Hoosier caricature.
The supporting company this year is
unusually strong. Frank C. Hartwell
is a very good "Pa" Hopkins, and Flor
ence Webster equally competent as
"Ma." The Ridy Scarboro of Frank
Minzey leaves the region of caricature
for drama. , Mr. Minzey is sincere and
convincing as the lover of Sisâ no small
featâ and owns also a very pleasing,
barytone voice, used in most agreeable
fashion. John T. Ray does the village
undertaker and is as funny as the part
allows. The rest of the cast fills in
comfortably. The piece was greeted
throughout with hearty applause.
"A Chinese Honeymoon"-. made Its
bow at the Columbia last night.
.The Orpheum presents a programme
for the week that has threaded its way
successfully through the obstacles that
the. approach of the holidays place in
the- pathway of theatricals. Howard's
comedy ponies and dogs hold their own
in the first act. Phyllis Allen sings
popular songs with a good contralto
voice. Miss Mary Shaw and Harold
Cohill very cleverly and entertaining
ly lend a recent date to a somewhat
old idea in "The Silent System." The
Ford â¢ sisters dance so well that they
are sure of popularity, and the Dillon
Brothers' songs are clever. Hermann
follows in the line of great magicians
with aptitude. Two good numbers are
"Marvelous Frank and Little Bob", in
novel gymnastic features, in which
"Tip," a well educated fox terrier,
plays an important part, as does "Ver
non, the ventriloquist."
Igrnace Jan Paderewskl, the greatest
of living pianists, is due to arrive in
San Francisco from Australia on the
steamer Ventura to-day, and the musi
cal pulse of this city is beating rapidly
in anticipation of his coming.
After several days of rest and prac
tice he will be ready to give the opening
concert of his American tour for the
season of 1904 and 1905, which will be
gin at the Alhambra next Saturday
afternoon at 3 p. m. The second Pade
rtwski concert will take place on Mon
day evening, December 19, and his
third and final appearance In this city
is scheduled for Wednesday evening,
the 21st. In all probability Paderewskl
will devote considerable attention to
the playing of his own compositions.
The work on which he lavished his
care and his labor In his grand opera
"Manru," which was first performed at
Dresden, May 29, 1901, and later at the
Metropolitan Opera-house.; in New
York, with Mme. Sembrichi the great
Polish tenor Bandrowskl and! Mme.
Fritzie Scheff In the principal roles. In
addition to his concerts In San Fran
cisco Paderewskl will make one ap
pearance in Oakland at the Macdon
ough Theater on Friday afternoon, De
cember 23. at 3 o'clock, and will give a
concert in the Victory Theater. San
Jose; on Thursday afternoon, Decem
ber 29, at the same hour. The great
pianist will play at Fresno on his way
to Southern California.
When one is afflicted with rheumatism,
to obtain relief as speedily as possible is
the first consideration: take Lash's Kid

ST. LUKE'S AI/TAR
Simple Ceremony Marks the Com
pletion of the Adornment
. in the Chancel.
' In addition to the usual ante-Christ
mas Sunday, services at St. Luke's
Church yesterday morning the dedi
cation ot the new stone altar and
reredos was performed by the Rev.
Burr M. Weeden.
For the last three weeks the work
men have been setting the fine new
altar In place. It is of Gothic archi
tecture and is made of stone quarried
in Utah. They are several niches In
the faca of the altar, which occupies
the greater part of the rear w^ll of
the chancel.
The services were of a simple na
ture and no attempt was made to hc!<J
elaborate ceremonies.- The usual choir
selections were sung and the pastor
in his sermon took occasion to refer
to the altar.
