ST. LOUIS, Aug. 16.â Mrs. H. I* Ma
gee, the mother " of Mrs. Marie Fleming
Everest Brown, is busy trying to discover
the truth of . a report that " her daughter
has married again. There comes from
Denver a report which strongly suggests
that Mrs. Brown has become Mrs. E3
tes. It is to the effect that in filing her
formal demand ' for the property left by
her late husband her signature shows that
she is now Mrs. Estes. Mrs. Magee says
she does not know Mrs. Estes.
Two years ago Mrs. Marie Fleming
Everest became known to newspaper
readers through her efforts to marry
Henry George Brown, an art student
with the ' Armour Institute of Chicago,
and a son of George W. Brown. . Brown
was more than willing and followed his
sweetheart about the country, but Miss
Everest's family, especially her grand
mother, who had t adopted her, were very
much opposed to the match. Mrs. Ev
erest, the grandmother, took her grand
daughter - Los \u25a0 Angeles. Brown fol
lowed.* /* *
Brown and Miss Everest stole away
one day and, went -to Santa Barbara.
They got a . marriage license and were on
the;. verge of being married when Mrs.
Everest discovered them." Remonstrances
were In vain and the grandmother capitu
lated/ making , the proviso; however. , that
they were -^to return with her to â¢ St.-
Louis *and be married here. They agreed
and ;. the " entire .party came . here. . where
Brown and Miss Everest were married.
Some time later Brown filed a suit for
divorce! Mrs. . Brown = promptly . filed an
answer,' and -one , oortlon was as inter
esting as the other. \ In , October. - 190 C,
Mrs. Everest, the devoted grandmother,
died and left her granddaughter a large
estate. . Brown died -In Denver. His es

found that the Pease's home had been en

was In charge of a watchman, who was
absent at the time of the burglary.
None of the stolen poods. were, found in
the prisoner's possession, but. Hllijush says
the plunder was passed to a "pal" who
v.'as fleet, of foot and made his escape.
Lambert says his companion was known
to him by, the name of Jimmy.
Lambert was taken .to the North End
station and he will be charged with rob

character with a record. . ..' ..
The strangers, on seeing the 5-pecinl
policeman, took to their heels. Ftir&ush
gave pursuit, and. after a chase tot some

Proadway at Flllmore street. Hilbush
covered Mm with a revolver. r b/Jt not
until he was forced to do so by Lambert,
who ma.de an effort to draw a. pistol. -
Jrlilbush's suspicion was aroused early
in the evening by the acttona of two
strange men in the neighborhood of
Pierce streat and Pacific avenue. 110
kept watch on them for some time, but
later lost track of them. While coming
down Pacific avenue after ,11 p' clock last

them. After a chase of several blocks
One of them, who gives his. name as

for \u25a0'â¢ their -growth r and prosperity upon the
energy and spirit of their citizenship and are
bound together by, the mutuality of their Inter-
: We. hope that this . body - will take a pro
nounced position in keeping the citizenship of
this country up to the standard it has at
tained ,by â¢ opposing the modification of any
treaty that will admit to our shores undeslra i
ble Astatic immigration. We ace interested, as
other States are interested, in pursuing a pol
icy that will enlarge our .markets in the
Orient. We .want the benefit of Increased .and:
lncreagtng. trade in the Far East, if. It. can be
purchased at a fair price. In : opening :the
gates wider, to Chinese 'lmmigration and there
for debasing, our American citizenship we are,
paying too great a price.. -. . . â¢
Judging by, the rich contributions of the
congress In the past, I am confident that the
present \u25a0 meeting will be successful In its out
come. \u25a0 I compliment the congress on the work
done by it In behalf of Â»Jie reclamation of arid
lands and credit It with having been the cause
of the presence of , $30,fH)0,00O now In the Na

Japan omitted to- demand the epen-door
in Siberia and the opening of Siberian
rivers to the navigation of. the world.
Vladivostok, as a free port. It declares,
would not benefit Japan much, .but it
would greatly assist-, the development

The Nlchl Nlchl to-morrow will say:
"The continuance, of tha conference
is indicative of a hopeful, prospect for
the conclusion of peace." :
The paper decltfres ; that~if the Rus-.
sians had rejected absolutely the ques
tions Of reimbursement and. the cession
of Saghalien Island. the Japanese would
have withdrawn from the -.conference. 1
These demands are equally- important
with the Korean and Manchurian ques
tions.' ' ':
"Japan's victories have beenrealized
by a vast sacrifice of money and blood,"
It says. "Without the prospect of Rus
sia's compliance In the payment of war
expenses and the transfer of Saghalien
Island there Is no reason why the con
ference should be continued."'
The Nichi Nlchi expresses the belief
that the Russian delegates divulged the
nature of the Japanese demands and 1
suggests that the Japanese delegates
abandon the plan of secrecy and keep
their people Informed; as to the pro
gress of the conference. \u25a0;'

SEOUL* Aug. 16. â After repeated
Japan will make a stiff fight for the
possession of the interned Russian war
rhipy. One reason for this is the
Japanese intention not to apply the
Indemnity, in case one shall be received,
to the increase of the navy. The in
demnity will be used for paying -off
financial obligations incurred during the
\u25a0war, the granting- of pensions and the
development of the Japanese educa
tional system. To replace the losses to
the fle<?t Incurred In the war, and to
maintain tlift fleet up to a standard of
Btrengtn and efficiency sufficient to de
fend hersfelf, Japan needs additional
battleships and cruisers. If she ob
tains all of the Russian ships now In
terned In neutral harbors and succeeds
in raising a number of those sunk In
battle she will have saved the neces
sity, for the present at least, of a large
naval budg-et Â£or construction. The Lon
don government Is strongly In tayor of
Insistence upon this article and Japan
seems to have set her heart upon the
surrender of the ships by Russia.
Both Japanese and Russian plenipo
tentiaries were late for dinner to-night,
having stopped at the cottage of Mrs.
Peirs for a cup of tea and to apologize
for not bavins reached there in time
for a formal reception earlier in the
afternoon. '\u25a0\u25a0'*'.'.
There were persistent rumors about the
hotel late to-day that several powers, in
cluding the Washington Government, are
bringing pressure to bear upon Japan to
forego "the cost of the war", and content
herself with such other compensation as
she can secure out of the railroad, the
Russian property in Port Arthur and
Dalny and the cost of the maintenance
of Russian prisoners In Japan, this only
on the theory that Russia will eventually
agree to cede Saghalien, which" is now
potentially conquered territory. This Is
undoubtedly the line of ultimate compro
mise, if compromise there is to be.
Neither the Question of making: Vlad
ivostok an "open port* or the Amur
River an international waterway Is
Included in the Japanese terms.
JAPAX WAXTS LVTERXED SHIPS.
Russia, by the acceptance of these two
articles in connection with articles 2. 2,
4 and 6, surrenders every vestige of her
ambition in Manchuria. She closes the
door to the warm water, ice-free port of
Dalny, upon which she lavished her mil
lions, and retains only the link of the rail
road connecting her European possessions
with the maritime provices upon the Pa
cific. The right to police it. with Russian
troops or railroad guards is given up and
its protection will become the duty of
China.
The exchange of views on the five re
maining articles Is exi>ected to be com
pleted on Friday, or Saturday morning
at the latest. The plenipotentiaries will
then adjourn until Monday and the in
terim probably will be used by the pleni
potentiaries in consulting their respec
tive governments. When they meet on
Monday their last cards will be thrown
upon the table. If there is to be-bar
gaining it will come then and suddenly
the conference will be over and peace
will be assured. The plenipotentiaries
will come together with protocols drawn
up to sign and part or all remain for the
elaboration cf the "Treaty of Washing
ton."
Articles 7 and 8 were disposed of to-,
day, the former "in principle," the latter
"unanimously," according to the official
bulletins.
Article 7 provides for the cession to
China of the branch of the Chinese East
ern Railroad running south from Harbin
to Port Arthur and Dalny and with a
branch line connecting at Newchwang
with the Shanhaikwan-Tientsln road.
Article 8 provides for retention by Rus
sia of the line through Northern Man
churia, which forms the connecting link
of the mala line of the trans-Siberian and
L'surri Railroad, with its terminal at
Vladivostok and Harborovsk.
The acceptance "in principle" of article
7 only means that certain phases remain
to be elaborated, hot that a dispute still
exists. But this may be possibly only a!
convenient method of postponing until
the final struggle the acceptance of an
article which would be used in the ulti
mate compromise.
RUSSIA'S DREAM VANISHES.
Before yielding on either of the latter.
It can be regarded as practically certain
that Mr. de Witte would consult the
Emperor.
MOXDAY THE CRUCIAL. DAY.
To all except the latter, to which Rus-
Eia will agree, a negative answer has
been returned, absolutely in the case of
Indemnity and Saghalien. Perhaps both
the others may be modified and accepted
by Mr. de Witte in order to strengthen
his position in insisting upon a conces
sion from Japan regarding its demands
of an indemnity and Saghalien.
From an authoritative source it is now
possible to forecast with a fair degree
of accuracy that the- crisis will come
on next Monday. Articles 7 and 8, deal
ing with the fate of the Chinese East
ern Railway, having been disposed of to
day, there remain. In addition to~ the
cession of Saghalien, which was passed
over, the question of indemnity, which
will come up to-morrow as article S; the
limitation of Russia's sea power in the
Far East, the surrender of the interned
warships and the granting to Japan of
fishing rights on .the coast north of
Vladivostok-
"I am doing all I enn for peace. Of
the eight articles we have already con
sidered. I have yielded seven. No other
Ftatesman in Russia would have dared
to do so much, and I have done what
I have done on my own responsibility."
PORTSMOUTH, X. H.. Aug. 16â The
prospects of peace are distinctly brighter
10-night. The plenipotentiaries are labor
ins with a seriousness and earnestness
which leave not the slightest doubt that
both are anxious to "conclude a treaty.
Thongh the main points remain to be
contested and each side speaks as though
the conference would go to pieces unless
the ether gave way. the spirit of com
promise is in the fdr. When he returned
to the hotel to-night Mr. de Witte, who
was tired out witb his hard day's work,
paid :

"Ah. yes," : replied Senator Dryden.
"There are lawyers who maintain that
It r is; absolutely* unconstitutional and
they: point to decisions "of our, courts in
support of -their/ contention." *
"My opinion "is that a very large ma
jority .of "insurance . companies will
favor national supervision. Under ex
isting arrangements "we are obliged to
conform to; different, laws and regula
tions in practically every State. The
laws and regulations are being changed
continually 'and different insurance de
partments place different interpreta
tions on the same law. What insurance
companies ' want is a uniform, harmoni
ous and continuing policy ;and that we
believe, is ; to be. had p^nly -through na
tional supervision." \
\u25a0> ''Are there* not legal, or constitu
tional, .Obstacles to national- control of
insurance?!' was 'asked.- ; ;
"I introduced in the â¢ Senate, at the
last . session, a measure providing for
supervisory control of Interstate insur
ance by the Bureau of Corporations. I
did so because I .wanted to call out sug
gestions and. to sound public opinion on
the'subject. I had the bill referred to
the Judiciary Committee, in order that
it might be -passed upon \u25a0 in its incipi
ency f by the ablest lawyers in the Sen
ate. I expect to reintroduce the meas
ure early in the next Congress, perhaps
In a" slightly different form.* The prin
ciple of the .new, measure, however, will
be the same as that of the first bill.
BILL TO BE RCINTROOUCED.
The President is known to be in
favor of Federal control of the insur
ance; business, If It can be brought
about constitutionally. Whether it can
be, ' is the point yet to be determined.
That the. Supreme Court of the United
States eventually will be called upon to
pass on- the question there is little
fdoubt.
At the conclusion* of the conference
Senator Dryden talked frankly.
"We discussed the whole subject of
Federal supervision of the Insurance
business," said he, "and our talk -was
very /satisfactory. Personally, I am
heartily |In favor of such supervision
by the national Government, because it,
would insure to companies doing busi
ness in several or many States < a well
defined and well considered set of regu
lations and a definite policy.
ss v At the last i session of Congress Sen
ator,: Dryden, who is recognized as an
authority on life Insurance, introduced
a bill in | the Senate providing in brief
for supervisory control of interstate in
surance business by the Bureau of Cor
porations. It was along the lines of
this measure that to-day's conference
proceeded^
Several months ago, at the Presi
dent's request, the subject of national
supervisory control of insurance was
investigated by- Commissioner Garfield
of the Bureau of Corporations, and the
conclusion was reached that, under ex
isting Federal laws," the insurance
business could not be supervised by the
Bureau- of Corporations .because in the
light' of the constitution and in view
of certain decisions of the Federal
.courts it was not regarded as interstate
commerce. ; â¢-.-â¢ ->s\^; â¢â¢
OYSTER BAY, Aug. 16.â Federal su
pervision of Insurance -was this after
noon the subject of , a conference at
Sagamore Hill, so important that one'
of the participants, oames M. Beck,.for
merly an Assistant Attorney General
of the United States and now special
counsel for the Mutual Life Insurance
Company of New York, having missed
the regular train from Long Island City
to Oyster bay, chartered a special train
in order to meet his engagement with
the President.
" The parties to the conference were
the President, Senator^Dryden of New
Jersey, president of .the Prudential In
surance Company, and Mr. Beck.
. The President, since the disclosure
made during the last few months re
garding; the operations'of the Equita
ble Life Assurance Society, has mani
fested a deep interest in the problem.of
national"; control of the insurance busi
ness. In his message to Congress last,
December he said: , ,
"The business of Insurance vitally af
fects the great mass of the people of
the United States, and is national, not
local, in Its application. It involves a
multitude of transactions among the
people of the different States and be
tween American companies and foreign
Governments. I urge that the Congress
carefully \ consider whetKer the power
of; the Bureau of Corporations cannot
constitutionally be extended to cover
interstate transactions in insurance."

DENVER, Aug. 16.â The fight be
tween San Francisco and Milwaukee
for the next convention of the Fra
| terhal Order of Eagles is arousing in
terest second only- In intensity to that
In connection with the presidency of
the fraternity. San Francisco has a
contingent of energetic workers that
never lose breath- in extolling the
beauties of California, and their appeal
is bearing fruit.
"We want the convention next year
and we can give the Eagles the great
est time ever," la the way Jerome Bas
slty of San Francisco \u25a0 declares himself.
"Out there, where the sun never fails
to shine. Is the place for an Eagle to
roost, and every brother who gets with
in the State lines will have his heart
gladdened."
San Francisco, according to Bassity,
will raise $40,000 for the entertainment
of the Eagles If they'll only fly that
way.
Former Congressman Bell of Cali
fornia was mentioned for the presi
dency to-day as a compromise candi
date, but the Californians say they
want the next convention and not the
presidency. They say they are not sup- â¢
porting any candidate for office.
Cities fighting for the next conven
tion are doing much trading to get
votes. Milwaukee is the most danger
ous rival of San Francisco.
Delegates to the Grand Aerta to-day
adopted a resolution extending "hearty
and respectful greetings to the most illus
trlous member of the order, Theodore
Hoosevelt.' President of the United States
and a member of Cheyenne, Wyoming,
Aerie No. VS."
With the representations of thÂ© grand
trustees and the judiciary committee be
fore them, the latter involving radical
changes In the articles of Incorporation
and the constitution and by-laws of the
organization, the delegates found plenty
of .work to do In the two sessions of the â¢
convention to-day." During the afternoon
the body went Into committee of the
whole to consider the report of the Judi
ciary committee seriatim and a number
of sections were disposed of.
The report of the grand trustee* was
read and referred In sections to appointed
! committees. The report called attention
'to the unprecedented balance of cash in
j the treasury and the splendid economy
and excellent management of the affairs
of the order by the grand officers. Rec
ommendations include a large Investment,
of surplus funds, summary treatment of
delinquent aeries and a new official re
ceipt, supposedly for protection against
members suspended for iinworthlness.
The grand trustees, pursuant to the au
thority Invested In them by the previous
grand aeries, reported that they had
amended certain of the articles of to- â¢
/corporation after \u25a0 counseling with able
lawyers. " One of the principal changes \u25a0
the Grand Aerie seeks to effect la to
bring the organization closer to the law.
so that Its Investments can be' better,
safeguarded * and Its responsibilities
known.
Taggart's attorneys won a victory this
afternoon, being given permission by
Judge Eason to examine letters which
Taggart admitted having written to his
wite while in the Philippines, but which,
he claims, weie written under duress.
Howard Taggart,; recalled to the stand,
said that he bad been told by Miss Bessie
Worth of Orrvillc that Mrs. Taggart was
a sweet little woman, but that she would
lose her reputation If she did not quit
running around with William Taggart.
He said he had conveyed this information
to Mrs. Taggart.
He said that Mrs. Taggart told him that
she got little notes on the backs of her
letters, written by the postmaster of
Orrville; that the postmaster also had
sent her letters in special' delivery enve
lopes, with other notes inside.
Corwin Swan, an Orrville druggist; C
J. Brickes, a liveryman of Orrville; How
ard Braden, formerly of Orrville. and Su
perintendent Mohler of the Orrville
schools swore that- William Taggart; had
a bad reputation for chastity in the vil
lage of Orrville.
A feature of Major Taggart's closing
testimony was a denial of the charge that
he .had ever been drunk,
r"1 have never been drtmk and have
never done anything to be ashamed of.
Getting drunk Is something to be ashraed
of," said the major. â¢
WOOSTER, Ohio. Aug. 16.â Major Tar
gart laughed to-day when asked about
the graft charges sent* out from Wash
ington and appearing In this morning's
papers. In a statement prepared by his
attorneys, he denies in a most emphatic
manner all charges of grafting. . r _^l
On the witness stand to-day Major Tag
gart was see-sawed back and forth be
tween his own and Mrs. Taggart's at
torntys. Almost the last question put to
him concerned the Chinatown slumming
expedition of himself and Mrs. Taggart
in San. Francisco, where a lewd woman
danced before them.
CALL BUREAU, POST BUILDING.
WASHINGTON, Aug. 16.â When Major
Taggart tiled his suit for divorce and also
accused Colonel (now General) Miner and
Lieutenant Fortescue, his attorneys filed
charges against the same officers with
the War Department. As soon as Colonel
Miner found himself named as an accom
plice In Mrs. Taggart's alleged misdeeds,
he in " turn filed charges against Major
on the regulation ground that an
army officer must not air his troubles in
public, if thereby . he implicates brother
officers who may be able to prove them
selves innocent. As the c-.arges on either
side are contingent upon the issue, as well
as the evidence, given in the divorce suit,
they have been laid aside by the War
Department until the divorce trial is
over. .

sad loss. He was held in high esteem
at the works. There is no reason I
can advance for the accident. It Is
positively not attributable to atmos

to any other explosion of recent date

Smith thinks his escape was on the edge

ALLENTOWN, Pa., Aug. 16.â A mass
of \limestone weighing thousands of
tons slid from a side of the quarry of
mill A of the Lehigh Portland Cement
Company at Ormond at . noon ; to-day,
just five minutes before time to quit
work. Twenty-seven men were at work
in the quarry, which is 1000 feet long,
150 feet across and 100 feet deep.
Only nine of the men escaped death
or injury. Four of 'them escaped by
running upon a mass of rock at the
opposite 'side of : the quarry.' The re
maining eighteen 'were - huddled yin a
space ten feet" 1 square.; Twelve were
killed and. six injured. - Two of the lat
ter may die. All of the men were Sla
vonians, who lived in shanties close -to
the quarry. :
The heavy rains of the last, two days
had "softened the earth and caused the
slide of rock.' When the ; fallen mass
slipped away a smooth, nearly perpen
dicular; wall was left, rising sheer 100
feet above, the bottom of the quarry,
while the. entlrequarry floor was cov
ered with broken, jagged rocks.

Felix resides at 1521 Fifth street. He
joined the fire-fighting crews ip the
afternoon's work, rejoicing in being
there unscathed.
Manager Peniman made the follow

"The explosion in the nitro-glycerine

said he was knocked flat by the con

would permit. After being given medi
cal attention Olson was sent to his

In a little cottage at 1521 Fifth street,

afternoon that they were told of his
fate.
"All of the work for the day "had
been cleaned up in the glycerine house.
If we had not got through so early I
suppose I should have been among the
missing, but luck was with me and
against poor Edrls. He was a very earn

done to look over things and to see
that everything was in order. It was

LOCATION" OF HOUSES.
The nitro-glycerine house, containing
three mixing tubs, stood above the
other house. To the east a little be
low was the dynamite-house. Beyond
to the west is an abandoned black
powder house, still farther west is the
dynamite packing-house. There are
small outbuildings connected with each
of these. To guard against spread of
fire the grass around the buildings had
been cleared and only bare ground sur
rounded them for some distance. But
the debris carried over the hillside and,
lighting on the dynamite-house, set it
afire. Great tanks-of water on the top
of the hill above the mixing houses
were opened after the glycerine-house
exploded, but on account of the ex
treme danger Superintendent Nielsen
would not permit his men to get too
near to direct the water to the dyna
mite-house. After that went up better
work could be done in checking the
spread of fire. On the bay side of the
hill stood large batteries of tanks con
taining nitric and sulphuric ' acid.
These were emptied of their contents,
while the grass fire was working over
the- crest of the hill toward the tanks.
Manager Penniman estimated the loss
to the works by the explosion at $7000.
This Includes the destruction of the ;
houses, apparatus and loss of exploded i
material. It is a conservative figure.
Herman Felix, the survivor of the
glycerine house explosion, considers he
Is under a lucky star. Concerning the
experience he said:,
TWELVE QUARRY
TOILERS PERISH
As soon as the glycerine-bouse had
exploded a large quantity of dynamite
stored in a packing-house near by was
removed to a place of comparative
safety. Four loaded cars of dynamite that
stcod on the Southern Pacific Company
tracks close to the works were quickly
hauled away, a switch engine crew from
Oakland being hurried to the station.
These were out of the way just after the
second explosion had torn a great hole In
the hillside, leaving only a blackened,
I acid-burned waste of debris to mark the
scene. The removal of these laden cars
was a great relief to the men at. the
works, the dynamite there being in suf
ficient quantity to seriously endanger the
lives of employes who were scattered all
through the grounds.
Superintendent Nielsen took charge of
the fire and rescue brigade as soon as
the explosion's shock had warned the
works. In the first round-up several men
were missed, but all were finally account
ed for but Edris.
Dr. F. R. Woolsey from West Berke
ley and Dr. Blake from Point Rich
mond were on the "scene, summoned
with all haste. They dressed the in
juries of the men who were hurt and
remained at the works until after the
Investigation proved that none had
been hurt in the second blow up,* The;
fire-fighters' were warned to keep as far
away as possible from the dynamite
mixing-house, which was slowly burn-,
ing. In the debris about the houses
were small tanks of glycerine. These
burst with sharp reports, signals of the
impending crash that should wreck the
dynamite-house. Smoke,- yellow - and
black from the acids, rose in dense col
umns ; for hours afterward- from <. the
mess of wreckage, while through.lt
occasionally silhouetted the grimy
forms of men beating back the running
fire that was blackening the hill.
The mixing plant proper and its aux
iliary apparatus, â tanks, oil tubes, and
the like- face the north and were* on"
The dynamite mixing-house exploded at
2:45 o'clock, almost exactly two hours
after the first blow-up. In this house,
which had been abandoned when the
glycerine plant was destroyed, were 2000
pounds Of dynamite and 2800 pounds of
nitro-glycerine. On the hilltops In the
dry grass were scores of men flre-flght
ing. end not a few more hardy spirits

houses. Again there was a cloud of
smoke, .a roar and aÂ«â¢ solid body
of flame marking the v destruction of
the . mixing-house. Newspaper men who
were busy collecting details of the first
explosion were shaken up by the con
cussion, but none of them, nor any em
ployes of the works, were Injured.
Fire continued to spread through the
dry. grassy hillsides into the underbrush.
Big gangs of men were sent out and after
a hard battle got the fire under control

setting fire to the grass on the hillside,
on shelves of which the various houses
were built. Flaming debris set fire to the
dynamite mixing-house. Men from .all
departments hastened to the scene to
fight the spreading flames. There was
danger of instant death every minute.
Superintendent L. NY Nielsen set guards
out to give ample warning, and It was
the careful precautions then taken that
averted a serious loss of life when the
second explosion occurred.
Two explosions yesterday afternoon
at the Judson .Dynamite and Powder
Works, near the- day shore, two miles
north of West Berkeley, killed William
R. Edris, foreman of the nitro-glycerine
house, seriously injured Albert E. Ol
fcen, a laborer, and more or less cut and
bruised seven Chinese laborers.
The nitro-glycerine house, the first to
go, and the dynamite mixing-house,
which exploded later, were demolished.
Much minor damage was done about
the works, while the shocks from the
upheavals were felt for miles around
Ba.n Francisco Bay, many windows be
ing- shattered through Oakland, Berke
ley and as far north as Point . Rich
mond.
Kdris was in the glycerine-house
when it blew up, and not a vestige of
his body was found. Olson was 200 feet
distant examining tanks of soda, and he
was struck by flying debris, being seri
ously cut on the head and the arm.
A miraculous escape was that of Jim
Ezro. driver of a dynamite car, which
stood partly loaded on a track near the
plycerine-hohsc. The car and its cdh
lonts were toppled over, but Ezro was
not scratched, nor was old "Dan," the
horse, a veteran of several explosions
at the works.
The Chinamen who were hurt by de
bris were either in the dynamite mix
ing house or just outside. A heavy
piece of lead was driven Into the
shoulder of one of them, but "none' of
them wore fatally hurt.
The .nitro-glycerine house blew up at
12:50 o'clock yesterday afternoon, short
ly after the material for the day's run
had, been ( woriced up. It was standing in
tiie Kinitiz tubs ready to be delivered
at the mixing house for manufacture
Into dynamite.
Herman Felix, the helper at the gly
cerine-house, had cleaned up his work.
leaving Foreman Edris alone in the
place. For years it had been Edrls'
custom to remain there and potter
about, examining the machinery and
making repairs. With a sudden roar a
great volume of smoke shot upward,
the boom and crash of explosion fol
lowed in a:i instant, a big- jet of flame
leaped into the air. and the glycerine
house was gone, with 4200 pounds of
the mixture.

SACRAMENTO, Aug. 16. â The Gov

from Governor McDonald of Colorado
announcing- that he has declined to
honor Governor Pardee's requisition for
the arrest and return to this State of
Charles Shumway, wanted at San Diego

the commission of the alleged crime
without being arrested are given 'as the
reasons for not honoring the requisi

of the application of. the Oakland .Trac

through East . Fourteenth street," from
First to Twelfth avenue. Councilmen
Aitken, Baccus,' Halm and Donaldson
favored the application and Councilman
Pendleton opposed it on the ground
that he did net think the company's
offer of $1000 was sufficient. J
S. J. Taylor, secretary of the com
pany, said a very heavy expenditure
would be necessary to reconstruct the
.road, changing the system east of Lake
Merritt.to standard gauge. ; He added
that the company's payroll. in Oakland
now amounted to $1,000,000 a year, that
the franchise asked for was in the in
terest of better service and was pot es
sential to the company, for it could, if
necessary, continue to operate over, its

thirds as great In cities as in the coun
try districts. In the North Atlantic dis
trict, however, it was almost as great in
the cities as in the country. In the South
ern divisions it is hardly more than half
as large in the cities as in the country,
while in the far West the difference Is In
termediate in amount.
. A "comparison Is made between the pro
portion of children born to 1000 native
women of child-bearing age and the pro
portion of children born to 1000 foreign
born, women of child-beanng age. In
1000 the former proportion was 462, the
latter 710, the difference indicating the
great fecundity of foreign-born women.
The * proportion of. negro\ children to
negro women 15 to 49 years old was
largest in ISSO and smallest in 1900. v There
has been a larger proportion of negro
children than white children. That dif
ference more than doublec between 1860
and 1880, ..but in 1900 it was less than half,
what it was in ISSO and less than at any
other census except IS6O. Though the
negroes have a larger proportion of chil
dren than the whites, it has been noticed
that the whites ,of the South ' have a
larger proportion than the whites in other
sections of, the country.

NORFOLK, Neb.. Aug. 16.â Kidnaped
eighteen- years ago, when she was a tot 2
years old, a young woman in St. Louis
who recently started an Investigation to
find out who she was Is about to be re
stored to her parents, Mr. and Mrs.
Michael \u25a0 Schainosts of Gross. Neb.
Kighteen years ago ..the Schainosts lived
near Ainsworth, and a neighbor, a"ranch
man named Orinsby, formed a peculiar
attachment for the little girl. One night
the child disappeared., A few days later
Ormsby moved away.
Last week a letter from a young wom
an in St. Louis was received by the
Omaha police asking them to find her
parents. The â¢; writer declared that she
did not know her name, as she had been
kidnaped " when a baby and had never
seen her parents since. The story reached
the girl's father, who has now gone to St.
Louis to claim his long-lost child.
The campaign against yellow fever has
now resolved Itself into routine and to
day, brought little in .the .way of new de
velopments. The fact that, the deaths
have not risen is considered an important
sign "and ; this,* with the disappearance of
foci > and the gradual perfection .of tho
system ..under which the Federal authori
ties are battling to preventa rapid multi
plication of Infected squares, was consid
ered by Dr. White to-day to be sufficient
ta warrant him In sayingthat the*, situa
tion ! was bright and the outlook hopeful.
In 1878 at, this season of the year deaths
were occurring at the rate of twenty to
forty a; day with a very much smaller
population.
-Professor A. I^. Metz of Tulane Uni
versity was to-day put in /ull charge cf

fully entered the stage of convalescence,
he is doing well and the belief is that he

ALIENS AND NEGROES LEAD.
No attempt is made by the author; of
the bulletin to determine the \ probable
cause of this decline." An extended argu
ment by General Francis A. Walker; is
given, suggesting that it is largely due
to the influx of foreigners and the result
ant shock to the . population instinct of
the natives. Professor Wilcox, does not
express a definite opinion, claiming that
the vital statistics. of the country are not
sufficiently, developed to afford a- sound
basis of judgment. He notes,
that there has been a similar : marked de
'cllne in the birth rate of Australia, where
there has been no such torrent of
gration.
Considered sectlonally, it is found that
in the North and West .there' has been a
more or less ; regular -decline, while' in
the South the change has been less regu
lar and the decline less marked. In ISSO
the proportion of children to , 1000 women'
in the North and .West was, five-sixths of
what it was in the South; in 1900 it was
less than three-fourths. In 1900 the,small
est proportion of children was. in the Dis
trict of Columbia, where the number of
children under five was hardly more than
one-fourth the number of women of
child-bearing age. The next smallest pro
portion was in Massachusetts, where It
was slightly .more than one-third.. Tho
largest proportion was in North Dakota
ahd Indian Territory, In each of which it
was two-thirds. , . . â¢"'. y- \u25a0\u25a0\u25a0-\u25a0 .
CAUSE UIVEXPLAIXED.
In -1860 the number of children under
five .years of agei' to 3000 -women' 15 to
43 years of age, was KM: in 1900 It was
only 474. The proportion of children .to
potential' mothers in 1900 -, was only three
fourths as \ large as in viB6\v i86\
Between 1850 and IS6O the proportion of
children to -women .between' 15 -and 49
years, the child-bearing j age, increased,
but since 1860 it has constantly decreased.
It is stated that the decrease has been un
equal from decade to decade, but that If
the computation is made : upon the basis
"of 'twenty-year periods, it has been regu

. WASHINGTON, Aug. 16.â That - there

rate in the United States since :IS6O is the
conclusion reached in a bulletin issued by
the Census Bureau. The ; bulletin Svas
prepared by Professor Walter P. Wilcox
of Cornell. University. It' Is; explained
that 'the^bulletin 'is 'not a study in birth
rates, but .a !study; in '.the.; proportion .ot
children to the total population or : total
number of women" of child-bearing: age."
The result of the' study shows that at
the. beginnijig of the nineteenth century
the children under ten years of age con
stituted "one-third, andjat the .end less
than one-fourth" of- the itotal population
ITie decrease in -this proportion began as

The West is almost unanimously in favor of
reciprocityâ Eastern Senators are almost solid
ly against it. The minority in the Senate is
divided. Reciprocity under the fourth section
of the Dlncley act ha* failed.
I believe that the Dingley rates are buf
nclently high to warrant our entering into
reciprocal arrangement with Central and South
American countries and with European na
tion* as weil. *
I very much prefer the adoption of the prin
ciple of reciprocity as a means of. maintain
ing and extending our foreign markets as a
mean* of quietly, without interruption of oar
business conditions, revising where . necessary,
the tariff a* a means of preventing discrimina
tion against our products as Germany ar.d
other nation* now propose to make. V \u25a0
But If we cannot secure the ratification of
reciprocity treaties there Is one other method
that was nerloutlj' considered by the Com
mittee oa Foreign Relation* more ' than - two
years ago .when it . became apparent \u25a0 that the
reciprocity treatie* could not . be â¢ ratified and
that Is the adoption of a maximum and mini
mum tariff. By that I mean the adaption of
an arrangement. by act of Congress somewhat
similar to that in force in France. Have a
minimum tariff, applicable to all nations which
* givÂ« our products " the most-favored-nation
treatment and the maximum tariff, *ay 25 per
oent higher, to apply to nations which dis
criminate against our proancts.
There are two remedies, reciprocity or a
maximum and a minimum tariff, aad a* it ap
pear* now, the latter. If either, 1* the method

sion permanent officers for the conference
were recommended, as follows: Perma

Governor Charles E. Deneen of Illinois
was introduced by Chairman Wilder. At
the conclusion of the applause which
greeted the introduction Governor Deneen
caid: \u25a0
It baa not escaped the notice of the Ameri
can people that several or the nations of con
tinental Kurope are raising discriminating and
prohibitive tariffs against the products of our
fields and factories. They call us "The Ameri
can peril" and seek to quarantine against us.
What are wÂ« to doyabout it? Shall we re
sort to the law of the Talon, or meet preferred
concessions with concessions? Such are the
question* which yon are met to consider. It
Is not too much to say that the nation hopes
that out of this conference will come sugges
tions and . recommendations which will meet
with the approval of our President and the
Congress ana lead to the enactment of laws
ar.d the negotiation and ratification of treaties
. which will not alone enable us to retain the
foreign commerce we already have, but to. en-
Following Deneen'a address Chairman
Wilder introduced Mayor Edward F.
Dunne, who welcomed the delegates in
behalf of the city. Governor Mickey of
Nebraska also spoke.
CULLOSI HAS TWO REMEDIES.
Senator Shelby M. Cullom of Illinois
spoke In part as \u25a0follows:
OFFICERS SELECTED.
Sanders nominated as temporary chair
man of the convention John E. Wilder,
president of the Illinois Manufacturers'
Association. The nomination was unan
imously accepted, William R. Corwin of
New York was chosen secretary pro tern.
of the convention, and Frederick Larri
bee of lowa assistant secretary pro tern.
We believe that our great basic Industry,
agriculture, the backbone of all our prosperity,
cannot be safely neglected rurther and that Its
welfare at this Juncture can be assured by
suitable Congressional acwon without detri
ment to any other legitimate American indus
try. It is Idle to say that nothing can be done.
Where there is a will there is a way.
The committee of arrangements has endeav
ored to make this conference absolutely non
partisan. Moreover, we have no present plan
of bringing about the desired Issues. We dis
tinctly disclaim any attack upon the protective
tariff principle or upen any particular Interest.
The long roll of delegates attending this con
vention. It etems to me. supplies proof at once
convincing and complete that there Is a real
demand from the business interests of this
country lor Congressional attention to the
aÂ«=(3s of our foreign commerce.
Ths establishment of fairer trade relations
\u25a0with foreign nations Is a matter that affects
directly the prosperity of every farmer, stock
grower and exporter In the United States.
One by one the Eurojiean governments are
tightening the coils intended 10 straighten the
American export trade in agricultural products
ASd coettufactured ppods. We are to-<lay face
to face â¢* Â«-l til a new and " prohibitive German
tariff designed to keep out every pound of
American breadstuff and provisions. Retalia
tion has been tried at tremendous cost to our
producers and manufacturers \u25a0 and Is a failure.
The conference was called to order
this morning by A. D. Sanders of Chi
cago. He said:
CHICAGO. Aug. 16.â "Dual tariff" in
all probability is the war cry which
~t will ring through the United States for
come years to come, instead of the, fa
miliar call for reciprocity. The new
slogan means the passage of a "maxi
mum and minimum" tariff law, permit
ting the establishment of reciprocal
trade relations with friendly foreign
countries by the vote of Congress.
Alvin H. Sanders, chairman of the
executive committee, of the National
Reciprocity Conference,, which opened
Its two-days' session atf the Illinois
Theater this morning, is credited with
originating the war cry. Sanders
broached the subject to a few friends
after the word "reciprocity" had re
ceived rough handling on the floor of
the convention, and it met with ap
proval among the delegates.
Six hundred delegates from all parts
of the country assembled to-day to dis
cuss reciprocal trade relations with
other countries, the amendment of the
Dingley tariff law, alterations of the
interstate commerce laws and kindred
matters. The West sent a large dele
gation, the great stock raising and
farming industries being' > especially
well represented. Manufacturers from
the Eastern States are , also strongly
represented.
A notable feature of the conference
was the attendance of foreign Consuls
resident in Chicago representing nearly
every country in the world.

â¢WASHINGTON. Aug.. IS.â At a confer
ence to-day between officials of tha
General Land Office Assistant Secre
tary of the Interior Ryan and Victor
H. Woods, State Surveyor General of
California, the long pending contro
versy between the. State of California
and the United States Government as
to the amount.' of ll'qu lands to which
the State Is' entitled c was 'settled.- '.
The controversy grew out of errors
made in the allowances of land to Cali
fornia in lieu of certain school tracts
and covers a period o{ forty years. It
was discovered that these errors result
ed in almost every instance In giving:
California more land than It was en
titled to . and the aggregate amounted
to a considerable acreage. No state
ment was made beyond the fact that a
basis of settlement had been reached
and that to-day's agreement required
only the ratification of the Attorney
General and Governor of California to
become effective.

Is , announced \u25a0 now " one \u25a0' can only gasp/ "An

occasion with congratulations. , Love "j has
.plucked : so many, buds lately from the social
garden: that - one's i enthusiasm .Is worn to a
frazzle and It -Is simply Impossible ' to be sur
prised at . anything, in - I tha ..engagement line.
Even Mayor â¢ Mott or Walter Lelmert might
succumb to Cupid's wiles now without causing
an eyebrow to lift, \u25a0
For some time Miss Juliet Garber and Frank
Strlnghanv have been suspected of entertaining
a romantic . penchant for â¢ each . other. To-6ay
suspicions ..were confirmed and their friends
have bÂ«en told of their engagement. The news
is most Interesting,, for- Miss Garber is a so
cial favorite, . being 'as attractive a girl as nat
ural charm, education and travel can mako.
She Is tha daughter of Judge and Mrs. John
Garber, : whose beautiful home In Claremont
has been tha center of. considerable | entertain
ing. Mr. Strlngham is a- San Francisco . at
torney." Xo date has been set ror the wedding,
but It will- probably be an early .winter affair.
-: All Indications point to unusual activity- ln
, musical circles | this . winter. . The- Wednesday
Morning' Club has. formed a choral among. Its
members 'and E.Punbar Crandall Is to wield
.the. baton.',:: This: club boasts of a number of
good voices and tha public - may hope to profit
by the friendly, rivalry that ,1s bound to result
between the Wednesday Choral and the Hugh*
Club. â¢' Mrs. Margaret' Davis Hughes, ' by the
way, has ;- resigned as accompanist for the
Hughes Club and her place will be filled, here
after, by Mr. Bretherick, the i well known or
ganist. Mr. Bret he rick was formerly accom
panist for the Orpheus Club and also, for the
Loring Club of San Francisco. " The 'Hughes
Club |is preparing : for. a concert at- an - early
date, and Llewellyn Hughes, the young violin
ist who met with such wonderful success whlla
in -Europe, will probably begone of the soloists.
Mr. Hughes and his wife and baby are now
hero visiting his parents, Mr. and Mrs. D. P.
Hughes. . . ;
The ' Palette, Lyre and Pen Club is pre

he- seemed so surprised that he did not

"If you don't get out of here." said
Mrs. Bunster, "I will call a policeman."
"Oh, all right." replied the intruder,
and he turned on his heel and walked
out of the house. He had no oppor

attempt to either delay or to legally compli
cate the progress of the great work to which
we have devoted years of study and incessant
energy. The duties of the City Engineer in
following the mandate of the Board of Super
visors In the preparation of the specifications
are purely ministerial (it being a charter re
quirement) In order to enable us to adver
tise for bids for contracts to be made with
the city and county for the construction of so
much of the railroad as the $350,000 appro
priation will permit.
On* of the chief objections seems to be the
use of the present rails as far as Fifth avenue.
That does not present a very serious obstacle,
as the same can be displaced after completion
with modern erooved rail.
A* a matter of fact the filrectlons of the
Board of Supervisors to the City Engineer duly
approved by the Mayor are to prepare speci
fications In accordance with the plans submit
ted to the Supervisors and Cnly adopted by
them. To deviate new from the plans In the
preparation of the specifications It would be
necessary to rescind ail the ordinances and res
olutions bearing- upon the subject. The Board
of Supervisors and especially Its Committee on
Public Utilities is perfectly aware of the ex
treme care taken In the perfection of the pro
cedure relative to the initiatory steps as to the
acquisition of this particular public utility. It

Supervisor Braunhart chairman of
the Public Utilities Committee, yester
day forwarded fronj., Byron Springs a
communication to Clerk Fay requesting
him to inform Braunhart's colleagues
on the board that he is unalterably op
posed to any material changes In the
plans already agreed upon for the re
construction of the Geary-street road
as a municipal system. Braunhart re
fers to the meeting called by the Mayor
for to-morrow at which the proposed
changes will be again discussed by city
officials interested. Braunhart's letter
sa^'s:
Ther* is absolutely no ground for tbe re
ports influstrloualy circulated that tbÂ« proposed
railway is to be a â¢Yamshackl*" affair. ThÂ«
plans as outlined have thÂ« approval of Mr.
GrunsJty. and the method of conversion of cable
Into Â«lectric conduits has been followed uni
formly In Eastern cities with marked success.
\u25a0Why Mr. Stut. the engineer, who** formulated
the plans, has not been consulted. In order that
he mig-ht explain them In detail, when found
to be objectionable in certain quarters. Is dif
ficult for me to comprehend.
In view of the fact that the sum of $3500
h&s been set aside for the preparation of,
epedflcatlons. the money to be expended un
der the Joint direction of the City Engineer,
and the committees of Finance and Public Util

Attorney H. V. Morehouse had his in
nings yesterday before the First Dis
trict Court of Appeals, in which he laid
down, before that august body, his
opinions upon the present -jury system.
He said the present . system was all
wrong. His remarks were brought out
in his defense of. Edward Richards,
whose case is now being heard before
this court.
-He said that Richards had not had a
fair trial, as the jury that; tried' him
was iiot a jury impaneled in accordance
with the. law. He stated that thejury
was drawn from the impaneled list of
1903. This was in direct violation; of
the law. Richards was tried In Janu
ary, 1904, and therefore, .according to
the law of the State, should have been
tried by a Jury that had' been impaneled
for 1904. He -therefore' contended that
the Jury that tried the defendant was
not a legal jury.
The attorney alleged that the. jury
system as laid (lows by the California
statute is as perfect as any ever framed
by an American- Legislature. : It was
not in any way the system that was ob
jectionable, but it was the manner in
which that system was manipulated. , It
was removed out of all its Intended ef
fectiveness by those who had the duty
of drawing- jurors to pass upon civil
and criminal cases. "The law." said
Morehouse, "says the Jury lists shall
be made up of the names of citizens
only who are not exempt from serving.
Now the.Tist selected by : the Judges
shall be for the ensuing year, or until
the next annual list is made, r It will
thus be seen that a juror who has been
selected and returned for one year can
not be selected and returned" until the
next year. The purpose of this provi
sion is'plain. It is to prevent the pro
fessional juror from serving more than
once during any single year. 'This law
is good, but what is the practice? If
you will look over, the lists of 1904 you
will find scores of men who served in
1903. It is upon this basis that we
claim that the jury that tried Edward
Richards for Jjislife was not a legal
jury according to the laws of this
State." ; .

That' the battle of Mukden furnishes a
particularly good example, of such use of

It was the belief of the Russians that the

vided into five sections, each of which
was in telephonic communication with the
general staff. The Japanese general thus
had his entire army Â«ln perfect control,
and operated it as a huge machine, effect
ing his purpose and^ gaining a decisive
victory. Says the writer:
"From the subdivisions of each portion
of the army telephone -lines were run to
a portable' switchboard, and from the
various switchboards jj trunk lines â¢ were
run to headquarters, several miles to the
rear. Thus the parts of each porUon of
the _ army were made to correspond with

Â§ "The rapidity with; which the Japanese
established telephone communication was
remarkable. Lines were laid well in ad
vance'of \u25a0 the main body of troops, even
when the army was advancing by forced
marches, % and perfect ; connection : was
maintained at all times between the fljf

THE expected seems about to happen. When the Federal
Government undertook to provide irrigation in the arid regions,
applying thereto the proceeds of the sale of public lands, it was
expected by many who had foresight that finally the general fund
in the United States treasury wquld be resorted to in order to com
plete the work that would be undertaken.
The scheme is nearing that point. It was intended that the
settlers on the irrigated land should pay back to the Government,
in annual installments, the cost of the reclamation. That' would
jnake a revolving fund of the original capital, and would transfer it
from completed to new projects. A large number of costly irri^
gation plants have been put under way, but none has yet returned a
dollar to the fund. One reason appears to be that Government irri
gation plants cost so much per acre of land to be served that set
tlers are shy about assuming the burden of debt.
As soon as an irrigated homestead is occupied the debt to the
Government begins to run on its entire acreage. If the limit of area
is 80 acres, the settler has to pay $240 for water the, first year,
though he wall be doing well if he pbt up his buildings, fence his
land, provide teams and feed for them, get tools and implements,
and get 20 acres in crop. He will then be using water on 20 acres
at a cost of $12 per acre. The terms and conditions are too hard for
the men who seek settlement on land. Those who have on hand the
amount of capital required to meet the conditions do hot wish to
live on land.
Another objection is that the limit of holdings is too small. A 4A 4
farmer must be a man of family. As his children reach maturity
he wants some land to divide among them. A homestead of 80
acres will not serve that purpose.
The law seems to have been made by men who never underw
ent the experience of moving on to wild land, subduing it and
making a home supported by its produce. In administering the law
the Interior, Department, has spread its legs too wide. It has'under
taken a number of very costly plants all at once. It should have
completed one, secured settlers On it and had experience to guide
it Jot further work. It is now in danger of a reaction that will be
caused by the cost of a large number of incompleted plants, and the
lack of settlers on the lands that are under the one that is finished.
FEDERAL IRRIGATION.
THAT President Roosevelt moved none too. soon in admonishing
the immigration authorities as to 'the administration of the in
clusion law is evident in the spread of the American boycott in
China. It is even reported now that it is becoming an anti-foreign
movement which reaches to all foreign nationalities.
If that be so, no one here need be surprised. It is taken as a
matter of course when we read of the violent ejection of Chinese,
merchants and all, from localities in California, Nevada, Oregon and
other places, where under the law and treaty they have a perfect
right to be. These acts are accompanied often by robbery and not
infrequently by murder, but they do not stir our people up at all.
They are not regarded as reprehensible acts. But when we read of
an anti-foreign uprising in China we become indignant. Yet the
Chinese have just as much right to retaliate. as we have to provoke
them to it and furnish them the example.
What is needed is a better knowledge of China and the Chi
rese in this country, and a better knowledge of this country and of
our people in China. This is to be had by a freer intercourse be-^
tween the classes of the two races which rule by the force of public*
opinion. To the masses of Americans every Chinese is a coolie.
Other classes of foreigners who have asylum here have" been the
propagators of this view. It is the tradition of the immigration
service. It is the keynote of all our policy and dealing with China.
Now if China is making a similar mistake in her estimate of Ameri
cans, it is easy to see that the two nations are too wide apart to
fellowship with each other.
It will be well if China insist upon equality by enforcing it
against us. That will bring about a more speedy understanding.
When an American gentleman, seeking to land at a Chinese port,
is stripped, minutely examined, measured by the Bertillon method,
his person searched for scars, warts, moles and calluses, and is
kept a close prisoner, denied counsel and refused communication
with any one speaking his language, he will be treated exactly as
Chinese gentlemen have been treated here, and will appreciate, the
vigilance of our immigration officers. This comes mainly through
the popular and official idea that there are no Chinese gentlemen,
but that all Chinese are coolies.
When a number of Chinese students matriculated in the State
University at Berkeley, they were refused board and lodging in
the town ; and when they sought to have a building of their own in
which they might shelter while pursuing their studies, the neigh
bors protested against it, and came near taking legal means to
prevent these students making the only provision that would enable
them to be at the university. Yet they were all of high class and
well-to-do families in China. They had come here to get a Western
education and a better knowledge of our people, and that was the
welcome which awaited them. They were looked upon as coolies.
Mr. Wong Kai Kah, who arrived on the Mongolia, has stated
the. case for China. This gentleman is a graduate of Yale and has
before now held an official commission to this country from his
Government. His use of our language and knowledge of our people
equip him for judgment on the situation. In his interview given
to The Call yesterday he declares that the American boycott in
China has no relation at all to the exclusion of Chinese laborers from
this country, but is caused by the purely fantastic definition of la
borer by the immigration authorities, and by the treatment of all
Chinese who come, as coolies.
We all know Mr. Wong's statement of the facts to be the exact
truth. If we expect trade in China we must give China equality of.
right with other nations. We must enforce the law intelligently
and humanely' and not ignorantly and brutally, and we must pro
mote a better understanding by a hospitable policy toward students,
travelers and merchants and their entourage!
It is said in Washington that our Government will demand that
the Chinese Government raise the boycott, because it is a violation
ql the treaty of Tientsin. Suppose the Chinese Government demand
of ours that it raise the boycott on Chinese in the many places on
this coast whence they have been ejected! Just what answer would
our Government make ? If we demand that the Chinese merchants
of Amoy, Shanghai, Canton and Hankow be compelled to take
American goods, and China demand that the Town Trustees of Palo
Alto raise the boycott on a Chinese restaurant, how will the situa
tion look to us when we see both sides of it?
The President, as we have said before, deserves the support of
this coast in his effort to bring about an understanding that is in

: WHITEWASH â 8.. Brentwood, CaL
Whitewash for chicken : houses is .^mada
by pouring boiling water on unsfacked
lime, stirring it occasl Ally-while it is
slacking to make the paste smoother. To
a peck of lime add a 'quart of : fine salt
and. half an ounce of Indigo. To each
three gallons of whitewash , add a pint
of molasses and a little powdered alum.
The- last : named will prevent ; the wash
from rubbing off. Keep the henhouse
dean and the hens will bÂ« free from lice.
X they are affected with such, dampen
the^skin under the feathers with water,
â¢ then sprinkle flour of. sulphur on the
skin, and pests will disappear In
twelve hours. So says a poultry journal.

Which reminds, of a story. /Back; in
the Eastern land, in a rural community,
lived a maiden lady of an . uncertain age
which*'certainly 'was hot \ young; 1 There
she lived, alonel and lonely, and I sup
pose that In her virginal breast was that
longing for home, 'companionship, the
patter of tiny feet ! and the pressure of
little lips against her ' own,- that every
normal woman knows. .Out of this long
ing and loneliness 1 doubtless, as ' well as
from the, somewhat ; disordered intellect
in which" they resulted, * sprang a little
.fiction with .which she comforted " her
days. According to this fiction the maiden
lady had a- beautiful boy whom she had
named Harold.- Wherever she went^ the
shadowy Harold accompanied her, and.
great was the jnaternal love and care
that she bestowed upon . "â the r. phantom
child." The people of the little community
knew of her ? harmless / aberration , ; and
regarded .it with j pity or contempt, as
their natures varied.: *

ilj j ow' do we obtain the greatest
i Iâ l educational influence?" I Â«*
1 * asked. "Through books, people
Â»and /life, or through nature 7"
It is a question that could be asked In an
euucawonal age only, when books '****
Confounded the i subject almost beyond
hope of repair, and at no other time.
: When white men were first brought into
contact with the American Indians they
complained that the aborigines had no
words to express any 01 their ideas. They
argued . that", they :had;no vocabulary to
amount to anything. .
! In -Europe there are peasants who con
trive to get througu life without using
mere than 600 words altogether from the
cradle to the * grave, and half of these
are, used on Sunday, only. >.
As the peasant isÂ» proverbially the stu
pidest of civilized mankind, in the esti
mation of those who know, more, it was
concluded that .the Indians were still
more limited in their range of thought and
expression. â¢ This conception was aided
by the perfectly evident fact that the poor
Indian had no "educational advantages."
I So much for theory wrenched and twist
ed to fit preconceived ideas. Later Inves
tigations Prove that "the aborigines have
a vocabulary richer than that of the or
dinary mechanic, and of somewhat the
same sort. In abstract terms the Indian
is weak; In technical terms for his wea
pons, the art of the chase, the pursuit
of war. the aspects of nature, the habits
of birds and other living creatures, he
has the white man far surpassed In accu
racy of "expression and precision of de
scription and definition. From his vocab
ulary alone important facts regarding
natural history have been gathered. And
the best informed anthropologisi* give
him an intelligence higher than that of
the average European.
This seems to answer the question as
between nature and books. But civilized
man is far ' from nature In the broader
sense, even closer to human nature in the
more restricted sense. It is from his fel
lows, his associates, that he learna the
important thing.
' In the young play has a greater educa
tional â¢ Influence than studyâ a fact that
has led some educators (book-learning
folk) to conclude that all study should be
made a form of play, rather regardless
of the other fact that man is doomed to
hard work at aome time or other. If he
is \u25a0to get along. â¢
The venerauon for books and for print
ed matter generally is partly . supersti
tious. Yet book learning and education
are continually confounded, for books
are admitted to be life at second or third
hand.

â¢The lines which~Moore, the~lrish~slnger
of; love songs, wrote on true : love's con
stancy, return to the mind, their elo
quence increased, when -one visits Sloper
ton cottage at Bromham. England, where
for thirty-five years, in a' happy domestic
life, Moore" faced with his devoted wife
the joys and sorrows of human experi
ence, keeping always an undlmmed
faith in all things 'good, and, singing,
birdlike, both on sunny days and cloudy
days of gloom. \u25a0\u25a0' . ' :
The house wherein they dwelt is i low
and long and gabled, surrounded by great
trees, and 'completely' overgrown with
ivy. There are flowers all about it and
a wealth 'Of blossoming vines. In front
a white road runs, on -and on, between
luxuriant hedges. You can see,: a mile
away, the spire of bromham church; and
the low gray; tower where hang the
bells whose evening chimed Tom Moore
so dearly-l oved, and fondly praised in
words as sweet as their own tuneful
ringing.
To-day the air is warm and moist and
remoter \u25a0 sights â¢ look dim and j far away
across the wide, green pastures; al
though distant sounds seem curiously
near. The landscape,' gentle and har
monious, reminds one of Moore's- own
beneficent genius.
Certainly never poet sang more ex
quisitely than did he of love's refined
emotions. '\u25a0- Nor has any other singer of
love songs ever attained the 'sensuous
sweetness of his melodious verse. His
poetic voice was like clear water flow
ing- joyously from an Inexhaustible
fountain. Airy fancies, gay of color,
flit across its rippling stream like
shining butterflies above the translu
cent current of a sunny brook.
As some one has said, using a graceful
figure: "Surely Moore was born with a
rose on his lips, while a nightingale was
singing." : ..-\u25a0>'
Many or his love melodies are familiar
to-day to those who have ' never heard
his name. On the other hand, many of
those who know his name do not associate
It with his songs and poems, which, nev
ertheless, they have heard since child
hood. . "Love's .Young Dream," "The
Young May Moon," , 'Come Rest In Thi3
Bosom," "Believe Me if AH These En
dearing Young Charms," as well as "The
Last. Rose of Summer," "The Minstrel
Boy," and many another, have become
so much a part of our music that we are
disposed to forget that they belong also
to literature, and to neglect the poetic
source from which they sprang.
Yet in Bromham Moore is still remem
bered, although the reason of his fame
is not fully understood. He is recalled by
the ' oldest Inhabitants as a cheerful I lit
tle man* who .was always pleasant to' his
neighbors. They do not realize, proba
bly, that his residence among them con
stitutes, 'so far as the outside world is
concerned, the main distinction of. their
ordinary, little village of red brick cot
tages,'sleepy lanes, and a gray old church
with mossÂ»grown graves beside it; that if
It were" not for. the low flat stone in Its
churchyard which bears Moore's name,
and for 'that vine-bound -cottage ; a mile
away across the fields, travelers would
pass this part of Wiltshire by.unheed-"

AND . now a word to the man or
woman who cannot take^ a vaca
tion or who must - needs be satls-
fled with just a snatch of recrea
tion one day in the week.
-.* No ; doubt you . deplore conditions that
tie ' you down to drudgery ' when ; you
long to be off in the woods or by these*
resting your . brain and body^ and- filling
yourself up . with' new I life arid energy. ,
No doubt you rail at the fate that keeps
you: in a stuffy office or shop, or behind
a counter,' or in close quarters at home,
while others rare reveling every .day , in
the delights- and diversions of ' the coun
try, the seaside or the mountains.
While you are plodding away at your
work the most alluring. pictures rise be
fore you of , the ! things you would prefer
to be doing; you can see yourself having
a glorious time boating or fishing, golfing,
yachting, or perhaps camping, up - in â¢ the
mountains where* simply living and
breathing would be a Joy. â¢
Fate has treated' you ; unkindly, you
say to yourself, perhaps a hundred times
a day. If you could only have a chance to
get thoroughly rested and recuperates yo v
could attack your " work and be 'glad it
was yours to do/ ; It is a shame you have
to be cheated" of your rights. So you
complain, until the thought -\u25batakes com
plete hold of you 'and' no day goes by
without your grumbling - and railing at
fate.". I :\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0-\u25a0 *' ' " \u25a0
' "How can a person be expected to get
up any vim or. energy for his work when
he hasn't had enough restâ when he has
no chance of obtaining change of scene or
experience? How can a fellow have any
thing more than a grouch when there
isn't anything to do but walk in the
same old parks, take the same old car
rides, see the same old people and try the
same old excursions that offer no real
recreation or pleasure?"
So you reason, and you go on grum
bling until the realization of . what you
are missing becomes well nigh unendura
ble.. Every day your work seems more
distasteful; every day you are more cer
tain that you will perish- if you can't
have a good long vacation, as you de
sire. .^\v-:- ,--.. "- >c;>:>.'- ;
Well, no doubt it would do you good.
But It does not by. any means represent
the only avenue through which rest and
recuperation may reach you. Renewed
health and strength and interest may be
yours in spite' of the fact that you are
deprived of diversion and . change of
scene.
All the invigorating influences are not
confined to woods and streams, moun
tains, oceans and forests. Just because
you are in the city at your desk, or in
your shop, or home, is no reason you
may not be conscious of revitalizing
forces. i .
Indeed, you may become conscious at
any timeâ right now, if you wishâ of the
elements that work for your renewing.
Recuperation is not a matter of going
out of your way to visit new places and
see new people. It is a question of 'ap
propriating the good that lies about you;
making yourself receptive to the magic
and vitality that exist for you in the
very atmosphere surrounding you. i
It is a fact, that these revitalizing in
fluences do surround you. "What you are
pleased to term empty space is not empty
space at all. It is a very ocean of life
and vigor and power. â¢? \u25a0\u25a0

. Dr.' Russell H. . Cool was the chief wit
ness before the State dental investigating
commission yesterday, and his testimony
passed the lie i direct to both Dr. Baird
and Dr. Mayhew. He denied In toto the
allegations made by Dr. Balrd on Tues
day regarding his" statements made about
Dr. Dunn. '
"I did not ask any one to vote for me
for the presidency of the board," fiaid
Dr. Cool. "I did not tell Dr. Balrd that
Dunn was. short nor that I 'knew a man
tc whom he had gone In tears trying to
beg $500 to pay pack the money. I merely
said that there was too much careless
ness In affairs conducted by the secre
tary and treasurer."
Dr. Cool; also swore that Dr. Baird had
first come to him and said that Dr. Dunn
was behind. He told an interesting story
of the entertainment which he provided
for the outside members, and said that in
former times there was no ! friction, but
congeniality instead, after these dinners.
\ Expert Melvin was put 'on j the stand,
and while he admitted that he had said
there ; might be a . shortage In the~ ac-.
counts of Dr. Dunn as treasurer he ha"d
never 'said, that there was such a short
age, because he did not have all of the
bank books with which to make, the re
port comprehensive. This was In opposi
tion to the statement made by Dr. Baird
Tuesday, â¢ In which he alleged that this
expert reported privately to him that
there was a big shortage.,
â¢ Professor E. S. Howard testified that
he did give out general questions to Dr.
Lew T. Smith before the anatomy exam
ination, but that these were general ones
and given out hastily. This seems to end
the question affair.
Dr. Mayhew was recalled and gave his
denial over again to the charge of un
fairness. He will be called again to-day
to conclude his testimony.
' j The two southern members of the
board. Drs. Howard and White, left for
home last night .
The Investigation goes on to-day.

once caught the fancy of the- audience.'
Wlillo the music bor^eis on the classical,
it is not so to such an extent ,. that \it
cannot be appreciated by , all. 'There. are
solos, duets, quartets and a large number,
of splendid choruses. '
W: C- Stadtfeld was. the director and
he has occasion to be proud of his work.
The Narrator is a prominent factor in the
cantata, and the,.muslc of this part was 1
well sung by Amon Cain. The other
soloists were Miss Millie Flynn, Mrs. C.
Decker Cox and A. A. Macurda, Their
i work was up to the usual high-class that
Is expected of ttie,se competent artists.
They were assisted by a semi-chorus com
posed of the following: Sopranosâ Miss
Ina Collins, Miss Irene Meussdorffer, Miss
Katherlne Rader, Miss M. H. Taft, Miss

The wedding was simple, all the feat
ures having been planned with a desire
tc avoid ostentation. The home of the
Greens was decorated *n pink and white
blossoms throughout. The ceremony was
I'crformed while Howard Huntington and
l)iÂ£ bride stood under a canopy of ferns
i'nd pink tiger llliep. Here the words of
the Episcopal marriage service wens read
by Rev. Dr. \V. H. Hopkins, pastor of
the First Congregational Church of Ber
keley, The Episcopal service was used
In deference to the wishes of the bride.
Miss Leslie Green, deemed one of the
liion charming and beautiful girls of Ber
keley, was gowned In soft satin, relieved
only by rare old lace, worn at the throat
and wrists. She is slight, a mere slip of
a girl. She carried a bouquet of lilies of
the valley.
The four bridesmaids were Miss Eliza
beth and Marian Huntington, Miss Eliza
beth Livermore and Miss Ruth Knowles.
liach was gowned in white, simply, in
â¢accord with the dress affected by the win
some bride. The bridesmaids all carried
2>ink' tiger lilies.
Miss Ruth Green, sister of the bride,
â¢was maid of honor. She alone, of all the
maidens making up the bridal party,
\u25a0wore a gown In which a touch of color
was shown. Her dress was of white or-
Kamiie, with pink nowers Interwoven in
a pretty pattern.
Hugh Stewart of Los Angeles supported
the groom, as best man.
After the wedding service an elaborate
t-upper was served. The bride and groom
left for San Francisco at the conclusion
<>! the banquet, and to-morrow will jour
ney south, and from there to Europe,
xvhere their bridal tour will be made."
The rooms of -the Green residence are
hardly sufficient to contain the beautiful
presents received by the bride. Cut
fciass, jewels and sflver of all sorts were
displayed in profusion.
BERKELEY. Aug. 16.â The wedding of
Miss Leslie Green and Howard Huntfng
tcn took place at 5:30 o'clock this even

Look to Paris or London.
"Explain to me if you can." says the
student of the. eternal feminine, "why
the* American woman has^not yet made
a dent on the >ld 'world in the matter
of fashions for clothes. "American su
premacy is art old story, but if the
American woman isn't supreme, who or
what Is? Indeed, what she has done in
the way of - marrying European cele
brities and instituting American ways
In Europe Is a part of our recorded su
premacy.'but In clothes she is not In It.
Whenever the last touch of fineness is
to be given to any of her garments it
Is described as being of Paris or Lon
don make. We have heard, to be sure,
that the shirtwaist is an American idea
and that it is making its way abroad,
but when it comes back here it is la
beled 'lingerie' and as 'created* in the
old world. As for the bride's trousseau,
though we have as many brides her*
as anywhere, their clothes must all
bear. the foreign label. The old world
still sets the styles In woman's dreM."^

Emerson had the best of Schmidt in
a pitchers' battle yesterday at Recre
ation Park, where Tacoma nosed out
Oakland by a sÂ»core of 2 to 1. A muff
of an easy fly by Devereaux allowed the
Tigers to make two in theVourth in
ning. This lead Oakland could not
overcome though they made a strong
bid for it In the eighth inning- and
scored their only tally of the contest.
For a youngster just breaking Into
fast company. Emerson is making a
record of which a seasoned artist would
be proud. One lone hit in niue innings
v.-as all the Commuters could find him
for. He won his own game by keeping
the Oakland slugrgrers popping flies to
the inrielders>. He was wild at times
and one of his free passes developed
into a run but lie had Van's men at his
mercy when a hit would count.
But for an error by Devereaux in the
fourth Schmidt would have shut the
Tigers out without a count. An easy
fly back of third base brought three
fielders into action. The ball managed
to slip through Brick's mitts and Mc
laughlin was safe. were two
down but Schmidt walked Lynch and
lilled the bases by hitting- Casey. Here
Cap Graham same again to the timely
rescue tearing off a corking single to

SARATOGA, Aue- 16.â The storm of
last night made the track heavy and
holding. It also made it hard for play
ers, as the line on mud horses, this year
is meager. "Jack" Joyncr believed he
had a good thing in Jacobite in the
Albany handicap. He looked so for five
furlongs, then he went : to pieces and
was beaten by three horsesâ Reddick,
Bill Phillips and Rafena. Reddick won
comfortably, being aided by the heavy
going, which suited both him and Bill
Phillips.

. The rival lightweights seemed destined
to come , dowji - in ; the same train, but this
was not deemed ' advisable by the man
agers, as It 'was thought an Impression
might gain ground that the relations be
tween; the men were too friendly. Nelson
postponed his departure a day to avoid
this. To complicate matters Britt post
poned his departure, bringing himself
Into touch with Nelson again.
Britt will be here on this morning's
train and" will enjoy himself about town
to-day before entering upon his training.
-Both boxers ate planning their training
with a view to \u25a0â¢ development of stamina.
Both have taken a leaf out of Jeffries*
book and " will go in for. rowing to de
velop their shoujjjer and arm. muscles
and thus increase their hitting power.
Britt has done a lot of this at Tahoe and
has found it beneficial. He will con
tinuo It here, but on a more restricted
scale, the only available water being that
j of Stow Lake.
! Nelson will have the waters of the bay
i for his rowing, as they come within a
' short distance of bis quarters at Lark
spur.
Much of their boxing will ba done in
the open air to accustom themselves to
the conditions . under wmen they are to
meet at Colrna.
Manager Coffroth has not given an
answer, as yet to the Native Sons In re
gard to a postponement. In addition to
the . committee from this city another Is
coming from Sacramento. This one will
be headed by L. B. Wilson, acting secre
tary of the Admission 1 day celebration
committee at Sacramento. . -The members
of the committee communicated with
Manager Coffroth yesterday and they
will probably meet him in his office this
afternoon. .While he diplomatically re
fuses to commit himself before answering
the representatives of the Native Sons,
ho is rushing his elaborate plans, which
is taken a s an indication that no change
will be made In the date.
\u25a0 The spell of, the mountains seems to be
over both^Britt and Nelson", as each seems
loath to leave his camp In the high
Sierras. Both expressed an Intention of
starting for this city several days ago,
but they have postponed the hour as long
as possible.

A Wart or Pimple
MAY BE CANCEROUS.
When a wart, mole or pimple shows
any Eign of tenderness it is a warning
that bad blood is behind it Often these
places are on the face, hands, legs or
other part of the body for years, andgive
no sign to cause uneasiness, and then
with a little rough handling, a slight cut
or brui*e will develop into a sore that re-
fuses to heal, and the sufferer finds him-
self afflicted with a cancerous ulcer.
About three years ago a blister cams
on the rigrht side of my nose. It grew
speedily in spite of all efforts to heal it
np; the pain was not very severe at first,
but increased when the sore began to
inflame and discharge matter. At times
the place would scab over and appear to
be g-et'.ing- well, but ths scab would drop
off, leaving- a red, angry looking- ulcer. I
had almost despaired of ever curing- it,
when tny attention was called to S.B. S.,
and after taking- a few bottles the sore
begun to gradually errow smaller, the
discharge stopped and I was cured.
Owensboro, Ky. JUO. MASSIE.
If the blood is pure and healthy these sores
cannot exist. S. S. S. is the ideal blood
purifier. It cleanses the blood of all
poisons and impurities, making it strong
and vigorous and -able to supply the body
with the strength" and nourishment it
needs. There is nothing that acts so
promptly as S. S. S., touing up the en-
tire system, helping the general health
and curing sores
PURELY VEGETABLE. but P urif y X ou t r
blood with
S. S. S. It is nature's remedy, purely
vegetable, and while driving all poisons
from the blood, will build up every part
of the system. Book on the bloodand
any medical advice desired will be given

, rious consideration. . Permission traa asked to
'discharge tcme of the lumber at this port, but

My Dear Mr. Scott: I wish all success to
the Negro Business League. Your organization
is absolutely out of politic*, and in stimulating
activity among your people and working to. In
crease their efficiency In the Industrial world
It Is also doing far-reaching work In the way.
of giving them a realizing sense, of their re
sponsibility as citizens and power to meet these
responsibilities. < I need hardly say that I put 1
moral betterment above pnyslcal betterment.
Hut it is absolutely Impossible to do good work
in promoting the spiritual Improvement of any
race unless there is* a foundation of material
well-being, because this foundation necessarily
Impllce that - the race .has developed the . root
qualities of thrift, energy and business sense.
It is as true of a race as of an Individual. that,
while - outsiders can help to a certain degree, ,
yet the real help must come: ln -the: shape o(
self help. : . - - .-. \u25a0 " â¢".
The succecs of your organization and the de
velopment among our colored fellow citizens
of the very qualities for which you stand will
mean more for the solution of the race problem,
than any philanthropic - efforts merely . from
outside could possibly, .do. . Wishing, you . all
success, I am elrcerely yours. .

Tba Siberia left, promptly at 1 o'clock.
And thereby bangs a tale of many disap
pointment*. In the â¢ first place, two in
ter.dins yafseiigcrs who arrived at 1:01 p.
rti. missed the steamer.. But that was
their own lault. They were sixty seconds
late. Just as the lines were cast off a
truck load of United States mail, of the
coir.ins of which the company had been
iicrtilied some time before, reached the
wharf. L4ke the belated passengers, it
was left behind. The leaving of this mail
racuns that the letter from home which
hundreds of exiles in the Far East are
expecting on the Siberia will not reach
its destination for a week or bo after it
should have arrived. It may also mean
not a little inconvenience to innumerable
business houses. When the office mail is
late, and It usually is. Pacific Mail liners
wait for it. They have waited several
hours. Passengers and the United States
mail, however, must be on time or they
will get left. .
Arthur O'Neill, formerly chief officer
of the Siberia, accompanied Mr. Schwer
in as a passenger. Schwerin Is taking
O'Neni with him to look into the steve
doring problem at Yokohama.
The Siberia carried a large number of
passengers and more than SOOO tons ot
cargo. She took silver bullion valued at
tSOUJBO.
Among her passengers were the follow
ing:
The Taciiic Mail Company's liner Sibe
ria, Captain J. Tremaine Smith, sailed
J esteruay f or the Orient. She left prompt
ly .Â«a 1 o'clock, prt-pared to make a rec
ord run to Honolulu. President E. H.
Harriruan, with his wife and family, is
on board, and Vice President and Gen
ira) Manager R. P. Schweriu is also a
passenger. jjr.i r . Harriman wants to make
a longer ttay at Honolulu than the
iiners schedule provides, and as he does
not with to upset the schedule the Sibe
ria is going to be tent along at Cml
pp^f-d. If all records for this run are not
broken it will be because the Siberia
has not cot St in her. To enable her to
inj.ke x.ha tirce a sreat quantity of extra
ccal *\as taken and lifteen additional coal
jjssscrs were shipped.

IE ?' KI - *- LEWS .âThe moiiey situation will
Sv.cn be put to the test, as the time is now at
fcanu \vhÂ«_n funds tÂ» ill be needed at the \VÂ«et
w ..nar.ee tfc* crops. Western bankers are par
tieuiatir confident this year that they will not
cai.6 te boraow money irom New York finan
cial insutuaess. They are unquestionably cor
reci m the main, but their statement iM tech
r.icaJ kc tar as the money supply Is concerned,
lor th;s neasce: New, York is a central re
serve .-city, and the out-of-towa banks are p;r
a.txed \& .count their deposits in New York
â¢^ IÂ«.rt of their legal nreerves. Therefore, as
ts ysiialiy the case, when fucoa are not needed
lor crops and the Western backs cannot" uÂ»*
them ia their cwn localities they send them to
New York and the New York banks either pay
them interest upon these funds as depoeits or
J urchase with them commercial paper or other
l oriss oi . maturing investmesta. Naturally,
this form of employment fÂ©r Western money
U so arracg-ed.as to make tfcs funds available
â¢when most needtd at the West; and the cur
rency movement, therefore, becomes adverse to
JÂ»ew; York- at- crop-moving periods even though
euch " movement reflects merely the return of
the West's own funds, i So far as the financial
t uvcrth of ,N*w York is concerned .it really
makes iltUe difference what these westbound
fuuCs are i.-ailrd since, they figure in the state
ramt of the Associated Banks and contribute
to s.hÂ«? res>a-ve. The larger the crops the greater
the ccÃcentmtion of currency required ta
finance, them; and it is hardly probable that
th;s . ve&r of brilliant harvt*ts is going to
entirely escape come period of monetary con
traction.
\ Railroad earnings and back clearings con
tinue to reflect general trade prosperity, j&nd.
taken altogether, commercial and industrial
conditions leave little to be desired. On trie
. < ih*r li&nd. there are ooe or two features aside
X," n the possible mcn*y unrvst that will bÂ»ar
TÂ» .tching. Two of these have direct con
\u25a0 :--rcticn with the South; nameiy. the fever sit
vatica and th,Â« poorer proepects of the cotton
crop. The former has not succumbed to the
restrictive tneasures as rapidly as was bopÂ«Â»d.
although there is. cf course, no occasion for
tsfcirvs anything like an alarmist view of the
s:iua.tion. Cotton crop prospects show deterior
ation, *nd while this deterioration may be re
f.ected in higher prices fcr the staple it Is not
the part of wisdotn to argue that a short crop
is equal In naticna.l wealth to a large one.
J. S. BACHE & CO. â The indications set
rcrth la the Government crop report vindicate
thf Â«xjÂ»ectaiions of the most sanguine. In
ci-uilsg the Onadian crop, the total wheat
yield is indicated 'to be 791.0C0.000 bushels, as
compared with 607.300.000 boshels a year ago.
wr-.ile the Indications are for a corn crop of
Â£.t*7,GCo.eow bushels, or 23O,(Â«XI.O00 bushels '
more than was harvested in 1904. Bumper
crops arc- practically assured to the country, and
thÂ«:r sale at satisfactory prices meaas another
year- of unarmed prosperity.
It is earnlTigs and dividends that interest
thr averse tnan" Ttrfs year's dividend record"
ha* been a. "LriiSiant one, and the long list "of
' increases will shortly be augmented by tn
erâ¬aj?e<l disbursements by Chesapeake and Ohio '
and NorTcllc . and Western. Earnings for the
Sscal "^-fir : Js*f %irCw4. wfcie-fc are -bow Â«omin|r

place heavy orders for equipment and su;>-.
plies. Rail'crdert for 200. 0C0 tons of heavy
rails are pending, aad will probably be closed
this month. For th* full fiscal year, the Steel
company's earnings are conservatively estimat
ed Â«t $125.000,Â«}0 net. or equal to 10 per cent
on the common stock.- TheVteel business to
day Is mere stable than in 19C2 at the height
of the boom. The demand is large and increas
ing, and manufacturers are determined to kÂ«p
yTices witfcln reaaen and prevent an inflated
market- Ctopper is strong at lS^ic to 15% c a

is a natural ont. Consumption Is exceeding

Say of the Situation.
general list than those which moved yesterday.
The market nevertheless continued spotty alid
uneven and showed moderate Improvement in
the volume of trading. For some time after
the opening, indeed, there was a broad, activity
In the market, which enabled the bears to op
erate in and out with facility and swept up a
j Jurther large %'oluine of sales to realize profits
without any notable effect on the price level.
This was the period of the trading which dem
onstrated the growth oÂ£ the outside interest in
the market. Euch as It is. London discounts
hardened again to-day and buying for the ac
ccunt of that center was not in evidence in the
absorptive power of the market. There was a
marked decline in animation after the working
â¢off of orders accumulated over night in com
mission houses. The market then relapsed into
1 its professional character and gave evidence of
j renewed operations by that element to get up
j prices here and to serve a= sustaining | point"
while similar measures were extended to other
} portions of the list. \u25a0 The ' encouragement to
1 continue these efforts to get prices still higher
; comes largely from the contemplation of the
I favorable general conditions and prospects In
1 the country. There is some revival, however.
I of. stories of deals and combinations surrounded
with more or less mystery, after the manner of
I thÂ« stories which are most effective on senti-
I merit at times of speculauve excitement. . The
'vitality of such rumors" regarding the Northern
Securities group seems proof against all de-
I lays and disappointments. Its renewed infiuenoe
: was seen to-day In the rise in Union Pacific.
; which would benefit largely the enhanced valu
j ation of Great Northern and Northern Pacific.
j The revived and successful speculation in
i Reading up to a new record level had a- notable
t effect In encouraging speculative spirits, the
I prolonged advance iq that stock offering room
I for personal aaaiogy in ether stocks all through
. the \u25a0 list that present brilliant hopes to the
imagination. . The diminution In the yellow
fever cases at New Orleans was of cheerful
augury for the Southern group, which -has,
i however, been singularly indifferent heretofore
\ to the possible harm to the earning capacity
1 from the yellow fever â¢ outbreak. News from
) the crops showed no change In the favorable
; progress in the grain region, with the excep
; tion of some professed uneasiness over the ef
j feet on corn in low temperature and possible
! frosts in the northern portions of the belt.
j Strength of wheat was attributed to unfavor
able prospects for Russian Â«*Jd French crops
{ rather than to any conditions in the domestic
. crop. The clump in National Biscuit, which Is
[ supposed to be due to differences of opinion
â¢ over financial administrations, which threaten
j a rupture, was of a disturbing character, but
j was without effect on the market. The corn
j products stocks had the benefit of the reported
1 ending of the severe competition In the glucose
market. The rice In the locomotive stocks had
j a sustaining effect in the railroad equipment
! group.' The iarg-e demand for Amalgamated
j Copper after Its prolonged Inertia removed one
1 of the repressive Influences on the market, but
j the United States Steel stocks remained im
[ passive. The arguments in favor of low priced
; stocks centered its benefit on Chesapeake and
J Ohio. The market broadened materially in the
' late trading and the closing was distinctly
ctrcng. '
Bonds were irregular. Total sales, par
value. ftICO.COO. .
United States 2s declined % per cent, and the

of special value, are attending: the course.
The subject of the morning lecture was
malaria, and In the evening the famous
specialist took up the sleeping sickness
and other strange ailments peculiar to
tropical Africa.
By : means of microscopic photographs
thrown upon a screen Sir, Patrick showed
how the mosquito inoculates human be
ings .with the germs of malaria. The
lecturer Is peculiarly fitted to make this
demonstration, as he was the first to dis
cover that the malarial fever germs were
carried by the mosquito. . \u25a0'-..- Â£\u25a0
' Even to a layman Sir Patrick's talk on
the sleeping sickness was of great Inter
est. He showed photographs of two "ne
groes affected .with- this mysterious dis
ease that saps the life and stamina from
the human beinar. The faces of the un
fortunates wore :an Intensely . sad ; and
hopeless I expression, 7 for, as Sir; Patrick
says, "the victims always seem to realize
their condition and look it." The disease
has furnished a theme for. many a fiction
writer.' who ; "goes in" for ; the ghastly.
Within the last few . years more, than 40,
000: people have I succumbed . to ft. It has
spread rapidly) over Central Africa- and
now- menaces even the Egyptian : Soudan.
After much research a commission ap
pointed by the British Government to In
vestigate the ; sickness â¢ has decided that
the germs are carried about by the tsetse
fly, the bite" of which. ls fatal to .cattle.
It was '- thoueht , until .recently that^r the
bite of the tsetse fly was harmless to a
liuman being, but the commission is - now
certain â¢ that ' the Insect " Inoculates } Its
human victims with - the ,* senns >of ; the
deadly sleeping sickness.
The ailment is peculiar -to the tsetse
fly district, j and other Indications point
convincingly^ to the -conclusion ; that .the
insect - carries the germs * of ' the disease.
. Sir Patrick will take up the subject of
yellow fever In the near future. J
Stores "walk backward" slowly, at
first. A little strong advertising will
correct the pace. But "every ditch is
full of those who were wise too late."

thundered at the bench, . "if a devotional
meeting of Christians were unceremoni
ously burst Jn upon by a squad of police
and treated with the indignity that was
fairly showered upon these believers In
the doctrines promulgated by Confucius?
Would not the whole community rise in
religious censure? But these defendants
do not expect, nor would they app.rove.^a
public uprising in their behalf. They are
content to smother their grievance,
knowing that they will receive Justice
in this . court. Fortified" by their con
sciousness of Innocence, they can afford
to let the law take its course and bring
rebuke upon the heads or those who
would fain convict them."
Much more of the same stuff did the
Judge hear as he patiently permitted the
case to drone itself to a finish.^ "I don't
believe a word that any of these defend
ants has sworn," he informed their ad
vocate, "but don't let that ract deter you
from getting in all the testimony you
can." \u25a0Â»
The prosecuting testimony went to
show that the appearance of lights In
the windows of No. 1 Itoss alley, a for
mer gaining house, attracted the atten
tion of the police, and 'suspecting that
"fan-tan" had been surreptitiously re-"
sumed they raided tlie placa, finding the
twenty-six defendants- therein "congre
gated, but no material evidence that they
had recently bean flirting with the God
dess of Chance,, although such evidence
might have been removed through the
wooden chute that had been kept there
for that : very purpose in- the old days
when gambling flourished.
For the defense was set up the plea
that the purpose of the congregation was
to devise ways and means by which suf
ficient money might be collected to ' de
fray the expense attendant upon a
proper observance of the annual cus
tom of honoring the memory of those
Chinese who had departed this sphere
during the preceding twelvemonth and
left no living relatives in this country
to preserve their posthumous fame. The
meeting was called by Ah Cun, of un
blemished reputation for probity, -and he
had selected No. 1 Ross alley as the place
of gathering because it was unoccupied
and obtainable free of coÃt.
Ah Cun told the court that in former
years the calling of sucn meetings was
unnecessary, because of the ease with
which .the needed money could be col
lected by visiting . the business houses -of
Chinatown, especially the gaming houses,
the proprietors of which were most lib
eral in donating \ to i all sorts of religious
movements." " Since the suppression of
gambling/ however, it has been impos
sible to raise sufficient funds to hold any
of the numerous annual festivals on its
wonted scale . of grandeur. On the 15th
of September, for instance, falls the great
festival bf greeting to the new moon, yet
the prospect Is that in every essential to
appropriateness it will fall miserably
short of former celebrations, because the
boss gamblers lack both inclination and
ability to , put up the necessary money.
"Viewed from a Confucian stand
point." said his Honor, "the suppression
of gaming In . Chinatown Â« ls \u25a0 deplorable,
but when looked at In the light of Cau
casian civilization, which includes com
munal morality, It Is not grief-pro
voklng.. And it is not because I believe
that these -defendants were assembled
for any -benevolent puropse, but be
cause the prosecuting- evidence is In
adequate \to warrant their conviction,
that I dismiss the case."

It was demonstrated yesterday that Ar
thur Powell, alias J. C. Regal, died from
the effects of carbolic acid poisoning, but
whether the poison was taken with sui
cidal intent or placed in the wine he had
been drinking with homicidal intent is a
point the police are trying, to determine.
A preliminary test of the contents of the
stomach made by the City Chemist yes
terday disclosed the presence of the poi
son.
Powell was found on Tucsdy evening in
&\u25a0 dying condition in a room at 329 Minna
Eireet w hich he and A. C. Regal had oc
cupied. Regul's disappearance and the
allegation made by Powell .prior to his
death to George S. Smith, proprietor of
the lodging house, that Recal had his
(Powell's) coin, amounting to $40, and his
watch and chain, look suspicious to the
police. Detective Regan, who has been
working on the case, has so far been un
able to find any trace of Regaf. He
learned yesterday that Powell and Regal
had been working for the Sutter Pre
serving Company at Yuba City and came
here from that place about eight days
ago. A dispatch was sent there yester
day asking for information about them.
Detective Regan also learned yester
day that Powell had been employed as
an elevator nxan in the Waldeck Sanato
rium till about eighteen months ago. As
it was reported that Powell's parents
were people of wealth in Philadelphia,
c dispatch was sent yesterday to the
Chief of Police there, informing him of
Powell's death and asking- that Powell's
parents be notified, if they could be
found.
The most damaging fact against Regal
is that he refused to drink the wine, ac
cording to Powell's statement to Smith,
but urged Powell to drink it, which he
did frequently. Why Regal should have
deserted Powell . on Monday evening, un
less he feared arrest, the police ca.nnot
understand.
'"Though there is no denying the -fact
that in times of stress .the pawnbroker
is often \ a benefactor and a ] friend, yet
the spectacle' of, a : real, old time "hock
shopfman", outwitted at his own game
never fails to add materially^ to the sum
total of the mirth of' the world.
For months It had ; been the chief de
sire :of the pawnbroker's life to - possess
himself of a talking parrot â not^ohe of
these ordinary, ,polly-wants-a-cracker
birds, but a really â¢ high J class : parrot/
such as he had heard about, that could
pick up the English language in- a
month or two' and carry on a conver
sation like a barber. ; Money, was no
object to him. He knew" that such a
treasure as he had set his heart, on
would/come, high and he was willing,
nay, anxious, to pay the price. . '" ". ;:* '.\u25a0"\u25a0,
All this he explained to his friend,
Henry Vega, now a janitor at 533 Kear
ny street, .but , a native : of ; the Central
American States and an expert on par
rots in gendrar and conversational par
rota in particular. Having had busi
ness dealings with the pawnbroker .; for
a period extending over I many months,
and being a= heavy loser .thereby, Vega
viewed :in? the situation : not only, a
chance to even up accounts but a high
ly promising prospect of personal profit.
A VALUABLE BIRD.
"Them burds is mighty; hard, to git,"
he said, Vand they cost a heap o' money.
Still there's a peon friend o'. mine down
below Panama. Maybeâ "
"Say," broke In his uncle, "you get
that bird. for me at any cost. D'ye
hear/at any cost I simply must have
him andâ it's up to you.'* -
Vega promised to do the best vhe
could, but up" to yesterday his friend
femained parrotless. For the; matter
of that he is . still so.
For the last several weeksr however,
the crafty janitor. has? been much pre-,
occupied. Ho has gone about his work
in a listless sort of way. as if his mind
were .elsewhere. . Andit was. â¢.".To -tell
the bedrock truth he himself was else
where a good â¢ deal of the time, for the
"studio" of a Kearny street artistâ the
kind of artist who makes black eyes
look as good as new- â claimed : all his
leisure hours. What took the versatile
Mr. Vegaf there, might as well: be told
first as last/ It was a mudhen, a plain,
ordinary mudhen .' from the , Alameda
Hats with the i webs cut out ; of 'lts feet
"so's not to cause no onnecessary sus
picion," as Mr. , Veg- himself put it.? ;'
;-A~ few layers of bright green from the
artist's brush, a dash of red-at the wing
and tall tips, a splotch of gaudy yellow
down the bird's beetling brow "andâ Vega
had his i conversational parrot. V
Three. o'clock yesterday afternoon saw
man and bird turn into Third street at
Market, ; headed south; ;\u25a0 Vega,' keeping a
sharp lookout' from beneath ihis^ cap .rim,
saw the one he 'sought ,.-j standing? ; in
thoughtful attitude before the door of his
den. He seemed still yearning for the
conversational parrot.
"Mornin',", sang ? out the Janitor," as ho
swung, by the r shop ; as , though "â¢ with no
Intention of stopping.)
"Here, here,; Vega! #Vere you going?"
called the pawnbroker,*- running after him
and laying ; forcible hands | upon him. ;: .'JIs
that the bird? Moses and Abraham, how
beautiful! But vy do ; you go â¢ by. the
store? Come' in, Vega," come in."
rniZIS FOR A MILLIONAIRE.
"This 2 is.: one o* : them conversational
birds, all * right Vnough,"," lied the , custo
dian of r the cage, "but this 'un ';\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0 ain't
yourn. ,This 'un is for a millionaire down
to j Menlo Park. Yourn'll be up on the
next steamer. Lemme go. I got to catch
that Menlo train. That guy's purty lucky
to get a fancy -fowl like this un for a
measly fifty dollars."/^ . .
"Vega,, my friend: Vega," he pleaded,
"you know you owe:, me forty dollars.
Give/ me the bird \u25a0 and I'll give , you" forty
in cash and call the old account square.
Vat? Vould- you break my, heart, Vega?"
"And the , Menlo man?" *.'..<.
" "Ah, \u25a0 Vega, my friend, let him yait till
the next steamer. Millionaires are never
in a. hurry. Here,; my friend, here's your
forty dollars." * . '.
"And here's ,'\u25a0 your conversational par
rot," returned the bird 'expert, pocketing
the mazuma and handing over the feath
ered freak." '' . -'
"Vat language is that he's talkin*.
Vega?" queried , the new owner excitedly,
as the China. Basin canary let out a few
lines of mudhen protest. / *' -: \u25a0
"That?" replied ! the ; late ; owner, "why
that's Korean. He's talklh' about the Jap
anese war. He won 1 1 begin to talk English
â¢ti J the first rain comes.;- And -you'll not
besurprlsed at the first word -he utters."
".Vat'll it be, vat'll it be?" eagerly asked
the proud - and excited owner. \u25a0.Â£\u25a0>.
" 'Sucker!'" cried Vega, . as he ducked
through the door and disappeared. -
Twenty-six Chinese men of -commerce
doffed their skullcaps and ; in" turn in
formed Police Judge Fritz that "their
.Collective arrest on the charge of gam
bling was another police outrage, as they
were engaged in religious exercise when
Sergeant Koss and his posse invaded the
place of their assemblage and scooped
them in. And their Caucasian pleader
waxed eloquent In denunciation of the

And he abandoned the witness . stand
with gestures and countenance expres
sive of disgust, nor c : could he be coaxed
to resume his testimony.
"Whalle use?" he growled. â¢
So the case was dismissed.
William Dixon, charged with burglary,
was permitted to introduce testimony to
prove that prior to the time of his arre3t
he had borne an irreproachable character,
and among those who so testified waa
Mrs. Florence Corey.
."I have known Mr. Dixon for j twelvo
years," she swore, "and during all that
time he never,~to my knowledge, did any
thing dishonest."
"And you have seen him frequently dur
ing those twelve years?" the prosecuting
attorney asked.
"Yea, sir; very frequently," waÂ» the
answer.
"Yet you did not know that within the
last twelve years he had served a term in
San Quentin?" was the paralyzing Query.
"No, sir; I did not,"' stammered Mrs.
Corey. - " V
"Well, that's what he did."
Mrs. Corey retired in palpable confu-
Blob, and Judge Conlan informed Mr.
Dlxon that his previous character had
been sufficiently established.
Mr. Dixon's alleged larcenous specialty
was to visit cigar stores and surrepti
tiously abstract boxes of high grade per
fectos by lifting them from behind the
counter by means of a wire hook at
tached to the end of a walking cane.
Desire to diversify his Sunday morning
