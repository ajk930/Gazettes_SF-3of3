VLADIVOSTOK, March 6.â
There is great anxiety here over
the fate of the Russian squadron
of four cruisers, which left Vladi
vostok several days ago to cruise
for prizes in Japanese waters. Its
retreat to this port is cut off by
the Japanese ships, which to-day
bombarded the town, and the sit
uation is serious. It is feared
that the squadron will be over
whelmed and destroyed by the
superior force which Japan has
sent to intercept it.
The Japanese ships which to
day bombarded Vladivostok were
covered with ice! The attack re:
suited in no loss to. the Russians,
but cost the enemy 200,000 ru
bles ($100,000) in ammunition.
Most of the projectiles were 6 and
12 inch shells.

Mrs. Wakeley was 111 years of age.
respite the fact that she was married
three times and became the mother of
fourteen children, who all lived to the
age of 20 or more, and many of whom
married and became fathers and moth

at her death she left not a relative to
survive her.
Her life experiences were remarkable.
Three months before her birth and on
July 3, 1793, her father, who was one
oi the imperial guards of the person of
the Dauphin of France, was killed by
the Jacobin shoemaker, Antoine Simon,
to whom the young prince was given in
charge by the revolutionists. Her
mother, who was English by birth, died
in giving birth to her only child and
b. distant English relative named her
Pureheart. Her father"s name was Isa
dore Dumouriez.
At the age of 16 Pureheart Dumour
iez was married to a captain in the
English army, who. two years later,
was killed at the battle of Waterioi.
The young widow, shortly after her
bereavement, came to the . United
States with a party of emigrants and,
four years later, married a man named
Edward Gray, who enlisted in the army
and was the first American soldier kill

the first attack on the City of Mexico.
She then went to California with j a
P3rty of gold seekers, in 1S50, and
there, in 1RC0. married Oscar Wakeley,
a successful miner.
Two years later the Wakeleys re

"I am much distressed at the

consider a most deplorable event.
On the other hand, I consider
that our good understanding
with France has never been more
useful than it is at present and
believe that it is likely to become
more and more useful, not only
in the^ interest of France and
Great Britain, but in the higher
interest of general peace. Should
complications arise despite all ef
forts to prevent them the unio.n
between France and England
will render the greatest service.
That union must be closely main

ever may happen. I hope the

attenuate difficulties rather than
to aggravate them." /

TOKIO, March 6.â It Is denied here
that the French Government in behalf
of the holders of the French conces
sions has made any objection to Japan
completing the Seoul-Wiju railroad.
PARIS, March 6.â It is not expected
that Japan's intention to build the
Seoul-Wiju railroad will cause any se
rious clash with the owners of the
early French concessions. The original
concession was granted to a French
company in 1896. Later the concession
was modified, so that the road was to
be built by French engineers and with
French . material. A considerable por
tion of the line has already been laid
under French auspices, and it is un
derstood that Foreign Minister Delcasse
has sought to protect French interests
along the railroad, the same as he pro
tected the rights of the Panama Canal
Company during the Panama uprising.
But, while giving all due protection to
French interests, the officials say this
concession is nÂ»t one which Is likely to
give rise to serious complications. '

The Novoe Vremya also discusses the
offers of British friendship, but with
bad grace, saying:
The Â¦ Novosti prints a significant edi
torfal article, which is very conciliatory
toward Great Britain. The paper
argues that the understanding between
the two countries with regard to an
Asiatic policy will a??ure peace in Asia,
without which the normal development
of Russian and British interests there
would be impossible. If Great Britain,
the NovoFti says, would agree to an
outlet for Russia to the Indian Ocean.
Great Britain's possessions in India
would be unconditionally guaranteed
by Ruffia.

The naval mobilization foreshadowed
in these dispatches was partially de

strengthening of the crews of the Pa

ST. PETERSBURG, March 6. â Ad
vices from Vladivostok say that the
Â£500 Japanese troops who landed at
Flaksin (on the oast coast of North
Korea) are advancing toward Musan
(218 miles from "vTonson) with the in
tention of ultimately reaching Hun
chun (on the left bank of the Tumen
River, about 100 miles west of Vladi

flank. In order to checkmate this move
the Russian outpost, 1^00 strong, which
recently crossed the Tumen, is ad

The St. Petersburg correspondent of
the Echo' de Paris cables that he has
had an interview with Finance Minister
L. Kokovisoff. who declared that the
issue of the war was not doubtful. The
Minister said that, even assuming th
most unfavorable hypothesis, the vital
resources of the country would not be
touched. The Minister denied that there
was any danger of panicky withdrawals
from the savings banks, and said that
the greater risk of panic would be
among the foreign holders of Russian
securities: but. he added, the foreign
holders appeared to be reassured by
the events of tho last few weeks.
The subscriptions to the war loan
opened on March 1 now amount to $33,

PARIS, March T.â The correspondent
of the Matin at Tokio says that at a
banquet given on Thursday to the
American war correspondents the Vice
Minister of Foreign Affairs, in thanking
the American nation for the support
hitherto given to Japan, declared that^
the Government reckoned upon re
ceiving even more effective assistance
from the United States in the future
The correspondent says he has reason
to believe that the Vice Minister al
luded to the proposed loan, in connec
tion with which Baron Kaneko, former
Minister of Justice and rice president
of the Bank of Japan, has gone to the
United States.
Preparations are going rapidly for
ward for the commencement of land
operations. . I expect important events
will be heard of in the course of a few
days.
The Japanese Government is not anx
ious to begin its land campaign prema
turely, and is organizing its forces with
marvelous foresight and completeness
for every possible contingency. The
opening of hostilities ashore is likely to
give Russia as great a surprise as did
the naval actions. It is impossible, of
course, to give details, but events %vfll
soon show the capacity of the men
who arc directing Japanese affairs and
the quality of the troops at their dis
posal.
The Foreign Office here has issued
passes to war correspondents, but the
correspondents are not yet permitted
to leave Toklo for Korea, a* events are
not yet sufficiently developed.
According to reports received 'here
the Russians are moving large masses
(ft troops toward the Chinese frontier.
The population Is in a state of unrest
and is leaving the large towns. Russian
troops have occupied Denshodu. Che
nampho and Kohochl. but they are said
to be evacuating Kenchau.
It is reported that 20.000 Russian
troops are south of the Yalu. No seri
ous encounters, however, are expected
for gome time.
TOKIO. March 4.â Affairs have been
very quiet here after the excitement
consequent on the opening victories of
the war. The Japanese do not give
way to emotion In the same manner a3
Europeans when engaged in war. The
people are going about their business at
Tokio 89 if nothing in particular was
afoot. There Is little news from Korea
or Port Arthur. The newspapers have
ceased to issue special editions. The
present situation, however, Is only the
lull before the storm.

Vladivostok has been bombarded by a Japanese squadron, the firing continuing fifty-five minntes.
According to the official reports from the Siberian stronghold little damage was done. The appearance of
the Japanese ships off Vladivostok, however, creates an interesting situation. It indicates the correctness
of the report that a "flying squadron'* had been sent northward . to Intercept the Russian Vladivostok
squadron,' which was reported to be again cruising in .Japanese- waters. Ag the Russian warships most soon
put back to port to replenish their fuel supply they are likely to find themselves in a serious predicament, with
the Japanese between them and the harbor. It is .probable that the squadron which was sent to intercept
and attempt. to destroy them is strong enough to place the four Russian cruisers at a disadvantage.
Advfccs from Vladivostok reported that the Japanese force. which recently landed on the eastern
coast of Northern Korea was proceeding toward Hunchun, west of Vladivostok,; and threatening the Rus
sian flank, and that a Russian force had been sent to oppose the advance. A later dispatch pays that the
Japanese failed to penetrate the mountain range lying â¢bettyeen . them and their Intended desti nation and
that they were compelled to turn. back.
The Russians are briskly fortifying Antung, on the west bank of. the Yalu River, which they evi
dently expect to make the base of their operations on the Korean frontier. Private letters received in Yln
kow report that sharp engagements have taken place in Northern Korea, In which the Russians gained
the victory through force of numbers, although suffering heavy losses themselves. \
Refugees from Port Arthur report tliat there has been no attack since February 26 ami that the
line of communication to the north of the port is, still kept open. It 'is added that much damage was done
within the fortifications during the attacks by the. Japanese.
The Call's special correspondent In Toklo, commenting on the. completeness of Japan's preparations
for the land campaign.- predicts that the Russians will receive a surprise as great as was that ln'connec
tion with the naval operations. Like the Russians, Tokiq's tacticians will attempt no decisive movement
until their plans are fully matured. The advance of the Japanese army through Western Korea Is at
tended by great hardships. The weather is seveVe and a thaw one day is followed by a freeze on the next,

The interesting story comes from Ba
varia that experiments are being, made
there to manufacture cotton out of pine
wood. The method Is to reduce the
wood to the finest layers possible, then
to subject it to a vapor process for ten
hours. The pulp thus obtained Is then
plunged Into a soda bath, where It
stays thirty-six hours. It is thus trans
formed Into a kind of cellulose, to
which a resistant quality is given by
adding oil of gelatine. Then it is drawn
out and untangled by machinery. The
process is said not to be expensive, and
it is thought that if this cotton can be
made of practical use Europe will be
Independent of America and India. The
immense forests of Scandinavia and
Germany would furnish ample material
for her "cotton" supply. â New York

How Don Carlos Enjoys Life.
Albert Buttgenbach occupies a cell at
the City Prison suspected of having
shot his father, Joseph Buttgenbach,
Saturday night in the establishment of
the Pacific Packing Company, Fourth
and Shipley streets. Louis E. Brune,
the bookkeeper that was present when
the fatal shot was fired, is also, on the
detinue book owing to his reticence to
furnish the police with details of the
affair. The victim of the murderous
bullet is hovering between life and
death at St. Joseph's Hospital in an
unconscious condition, which precludes
the possibility of a statement at this
time.
Evidence of a damaging character
has been unearthed by Detective Thom
as L. Ryan which seems to fasten the
crime upon Albert Buttgenbach. A
witness has- been found, whose name
the police refuse to divulge, who eaw
Albert Buttgenbach transfer a revolver
from his right pocket to the left one a
short time before the crime. Jean
Nichols, a laundryman that conducts a
French laundry at 322 Fourth street,
has informed the police that no one
left the side door of the Pacific Packing
Company after the shot was fired, as
Albert Buttgenbach in his statement
to the police made reference to a blow
that he said he had received from the
butt end of a pistol In the hands of
an alleged thug. An examination of
his scalp fails to reveal even so much
as a scratch and no swelling Is notice
able. The bullet that struck Joseph
Buttgenbach was fired*' from outside
the office. The hole In a glass pane,
of which the office is constructed, is
on a line with the head of a man that
might be engaged In working over a
desk. The bullet passed through Butt
genbach's hat and entered his skull at
the top, near the center. The only
explanation that- can be given of the
broken glass door is that a scuffle took
place previous to the shooting. The
wounded man as he fell to the floor
clutched the jagged edges for support
and lacerated his hand.
Jean Nichols, the : French laundry
man, says that he had put up his wag
on for the night, and was engaged In
cleaning the harness when he was
startled . by Â¦ a pistol shot. ... He opened
the gate on Shipley "street and looked
out. His eyes," he says, never. left the
side entrajice to Buttgenbach's' estab
lishment until the arrival- of the police
who entered the store and he Is positive
that no one left the building. This
disposes of the' holdup story.

HEARS PISTOIi SHOTS.
Young Buttgenbach does not appear
to be affected by the seriousness of his
position. He declined to make a state
ment last night before being locked up
and Brune also remained silent.
Yesterday the police also took into
custody Jack Riley and Edward Gon
zales, ex-convicts, on suspicion that
they committed the crime. Gonzales
and Riley were arrested in a room at
325 Fourth street, directly opposite the
Pacific Packing Company. Riley was
known to have served time for burg
lary and Gonzales spent five months in
the county jail several years ago.
Patrolmen Moriarlty, Tyrrell and
O'Connell entered the place about 10
o'clock yesterday morning and found
Gonzales lying on the bed, fully dressed.
Riley was caught a few minutes later
as he was entering the house. The room
was thoroughly searched, but nothing
One, of the most peculiar circum
stances, in the entire affair is the ac
tion of Buttgenbach and Brune kicking
down the partition to the saloon to es
cape, they say, from the alleged thugs,
when they could have locked the heavy
door .leading to the factory and have
been safe if thugs were really In the
place..
Brune, who says he was only a few
feet away when the crime occurred,
asserts be did not know of the en
trance of the alleged thugs until he
saw' his employer struggling on the
floor with a man. This assertion the
police regard as peculiar.
The men had roomed' in the house for
eight months, and according to the
landlady, Mrs. J. T.. Stelzner, always
conducted themselves in a manner
above suspicion.. She was very much
surprised to hear that .her roomers
bore an unsavory reputation. Mrs.
Stelzner. stated, that; if they had been
accused of .the crime' a month ago she
would not. have .been surprised, owing
to their straitened circumstances. To
the detectives Gonzales and Riley said
that they had run' out of the house
upon hearing the shots, but had not
gone back to bed after the excitement
subsided."
Gonzales was arrested in 1893 for
fraudulently securing subscriptions un
der the pretense that the same were to
be used to aid the families of the brave
firemen' killed at the Ashbury Heights
fire. He was sentenced to five months'
Imprisonment in -the County Jail. Jack

It has also been ascertained, the po
lice claim, that young Buttgenbach re

allege, occurred between father and son
owing to the latter's spendthrift pro
clivities. It is also asserted that the

SAY HE MADE THREATS.
People who have suffered from the
alkali dust In traveling through south
ern Arizona, New Mexico and Texas,
find the old plague has practically dis
appeared. This baa been accomplished
by sprinkling the track with oil. The
principal reason why tht oiling of
roads has proved more successful in
the West than in the East is that the
California oil has less odor, is much
less volatile, and contains a larger
amount of asphalt than the Pennsyl
vania oil, and therefore forms a more
perfect crust of asphalt and sand.
When this work was first taken up
three years ago, many difficulties were
experienced in handling the thick,
mucky, crude oil. but at present it is
possible to distribute it the full width
of the ballast on the roadway, and that,
too, while running at the rate of about
ten miles an hour. From 4000 to 6000
gallons of oil are used to the mile. It
has been found necessary to follow the
first application of oil with subsequent
sprinklings from six months to a year
and a half, depending on the amount
of rainfall and the character of the
ballast. In sandy regions the oiling
must be repeated after any extensive
working on the track which breaks the
gummy crust. â New York Commercial.

If it comes to him in that method. His
present confidence is due largely to
Cleveland's letter several days ago to a

statement that he once entertained a

that their transcribing or spelling or

come here to increase their proficiency.

she couldn't spell, but bad eaid that If
she would learn he would take her

"The necessity for the relief here
sought is very great, and can be se
cured in the manner indicated without
sacrificing the efficiency of the service
to be rendered and at a. minimum ex
pense to the. Government. The only al
ternative which would afford .relief,
namely, a suitable Increase' In the
number of officers. on the active list,
â¢would involve so .large an expense as
to be. prohibitive/'
"A form of bill is submitted herewith,
which, if enacted into law, will accom
plish this and enable the department to
at once restore to their proper arm
and corps and to their appropriate
duties ninety-eight officers of the active
list now detached therefrom; some fur
ther reduction in the number detached
could be made by substituting retired
officers for active officers In the per
formance of staff duties.
Lieutenant Genera! Chaffee, chief of
staff, has invited Secretary Root's at
tention to the impairment of the effi
ciency of the army which results from
the very large number of commissioned
officers on the active list who, through
the requiremects of existing law and
the necessities of the service, are de
tached from their proper arms or corps.
From statements submitted by Gen
eral Chaffee it appears that there are
at present 423 officers of the active list
detailed away from their proper arms
or corps for detached service within
the army for stated periods, and that
the Saw authorize*, and the necessities
of the s^rvice may require, in the near
future, that this number be Increased
by, approximately, 77 men. It further
appears that there are 53 officers of
the active list similarly detached for
duty outside of the army under laws
which permit the number to be in
creased to something more than 200.
In other words, he says, there is a
minimum number of officers detached
for wrvice, both within and without
the army, of 4S2, and an approximate
maximum of 700. When to these num
bers there is added the large number
of officers of necessity temporarily
withdrawn from their customary duties
in attendance upon militia encamp
ments, as members of special duties, or
through sickness or leave of absence,
the percentage of absenteeism In the
army is shown to be very great, and
the difficulty of properly officering or
ganizations of troops and of main
taining their instruction and discipline
stands fully revealed.
TO UTILIZE RETIRED OFFICERS.
"One remedy for the evils herein
pointed out," says General Chaffee, "is
to Increase the number of officers on
the active list, but it is not thought
that Congress could be induced to
grant such increase in sufficient num
bers to afford adequate relief. A bet
ter remedy, and one which seems to
be entirely feasible. 1Â» to utilize the
retired list to perform all of the de
tached service within or without the
army which doeg not involve arduous
?ervice, and which for this reason is
presumably within the competency of
retired orScers to perform. College
duty, duty as Indian agents and duty
with the organized militia are exam
ples of detached service without the
army which retired officers can effi
ciently perform, and recruiting duty an
example of detached service within the
army which is clearly within the abili
ty of many retired officers; nor Is any
reason perceived why certain staff
duty, both within and without the
army, not involving service with troops,
should not be performed by retired offi
cers,. It is certainly not an unreasona
ble requirement, considering the gener
ous provision which the government
makes for its retired officers, to exact
from them the class of duties here
specified.
"I have therefore to propose the
amendment of section 1225. R.S.. sec
tion 20, of the act of January 21, 1&03.
and the act of July 13, 1892, so as to
limit details to duty with educational
institutions, with the organized militia
and as Indian agents to retired officers,
and that legislative authority be re
quested for the employment of such of
ficers, in the discretion of the Secretary
of War, on recruiting duty, as military'
attaches and staff duties not involving
service with troops; all retired officers
so detailed to receive the full pay and
allowances of their grade.

t were given of the thief. He was de

Loud yells of "stop thief!" threw the
resident* in the vicinity ot Hyde and

citement last night , about 7 o'clock.
From what could be learned from the
people la the neighborhood, a stranger
was walking up Hyde street, leading
his little boy by the. hand, when sud
denly a thug sprang upon him, and
leveling a gun at his head, demanded
that he hand over his valuables. The
stranger produced what money he had,
and also handed over his rinrs. The
thug then started down the street and
the stranger began to yell. This
brought about fifty children to the
scene* The whole bunch chased down
the street after thfc flying figure,
shouting Hkei,a 1st; of Indians. The
thief dashed into thV&fde door of a bar
back of Frahm's grocery store on the
corner of Hyde and Eddy streets, and
while his pursuers* were clamoring for
admittance he slipped out the front
door and tried to board a passing car.
The children paw the act and again
began to shout. This attracted the
attention of a farmer, who grabbed the
thug and pulled him off the car steps.
The thief pulled his revolver on the
farmer, who dropped him like a hot

TACOMA, Wash., March 6.â To save
the Hf6 of a â¢wounded and suffering
Eskimo P. C. O'Donnell traveled 600
miles over the frozen tundra and
streams of the Bering Sea region in
December. He suffered from expos
ure for twenty-one days, was com
pelled to Bleep in the open most of
the time, waded for miles through the
Icy water of mountain streams and
all this time cared for Isaac Wood,
a native, who had met with an acci
dent while hunting, which severely
wounded him in both hands. Wood
accidentally discharged his rifle and a
heavy 44-caliber bullet passed through
the center of his right hand and tore
away the thumb of the left hand. The
accident occurred far above Cape
York, 600 miles from Nome, and ade
quate medical attendance was procur
able only at Nome. O'Donnell quickly
perceived that heroic action was nec
essary if the Eskimo's life was to be
saved. Loading provisions on a sled
he started with him, but they were
soon compelled to abandon the sled
and carry the food on their backs.
They reached Nome December 22.
Wood was truly grateful, declaring
O'Donnell had saved h's life.
There can be no cause ascribed for
Young's desire to do away with himself.

fall to the lot of the average man.
Coroner Blackburn's jury determined
that the deed was done while deceased
was temporarily insane. Young was a
member of a pioneer family of Healds
burg and Alexander Valley, and his
tragic end caused a sensation among
his friends there. He was widely known
throughout Northern California.
\ SANTA ROSA. March 6. â "While
laboring under a spell of temporary in
sanity, yesterday afternoon. Elwin
Young, a resident of Healdsburg and
Alexander Valley, took his life. The
man used a Winchester rifle. He placed
the muzzle of the weapon to his breast,
over the heart, and pulled the trigger.
The sound was muffled by the gun
being held close to Young's breast, and
his wife and a lady friend, inside the
house, were unaware of the tragedy
that had been enacted until they came
across the lifeless form some time later.
Young came up from the barn, where
he had been laboring, and secured the
rifle, but his wife supposed he intended
to kill some animal.

TACOMA, Wash., March 6.â The
commercial bodies of the Sound cities

to obtain assurances from Secretary
Moody that work at the Puget Sound
Navy Yard Is not to be suspended.
The work now on hand there will be
finished In April. Eighty-five men were
taken off the pay roll last week and
since December the force of nine hun
dred men has been cut in two. Some
have feared that Secretary Moody
would close the works at Bremerton as
an effort' to cut down the price of ad
jacent lands which the department
wishes to buy. Negotiations have been
suspended lately because of high prices
asked by John Bremer and others.

SEATTLE. March 6.â Adolph Krug.
formerly City Treasurer of Seattle,
who was found dead on January 1
under circumstances which indicated
suicide, is charged in two suits filed
Saturday with having forged the names
of his wife and her brother. William
Ritterhoff, to notes aggregating con
siderably more than $10,000.
On December 31, the day before
Krug died, Mrs. Krug went to a bank
which held one of the notes, although
her husband tried to dissuade her, and
there ascertained the facts. That after
noon Krug crossed Puget Sound to
Pleasant Beach, a few miles away
from Seattle, and the next morning
was found dead in bed in the hotel
at that place. The suits are to have
the notes declared void.
Krug was formerly Treasurer of the
city and spent a term In the peniten
tiary, being pardoned, however, before
it was completed, for a shortage in his
accounts. It was generally believed
that he was guilty of no wrong intent
and that he was a victim of his friends,
to whom he loaned the city's money,
and that his shortage was the result of
his own Ignorance of business and
bookkeeping. It was on this theory
that he was pardoned. The case was
quite a noted one at the time.

All this time he is unconsciously ab
sorbing the great lesson of systematic
application; he is learning to lay out
work on a definite plan, and then me
thodically following that plan to se
cure the desired result, exactly what
/.he skilled blacksmith docs.
It is not the purpose of those who
advocate blacksmithing for boys to
teach them even the rudiments of the
trade with the Idea they will follow it.
There is not so much even of the mar -
ual training idea to the proposition.
The thought rather is along the line
of play, but play which will develop
the body and pleasantly discipline the
mind. The equipment is to be of the
simplest characterâ a light hammer or
two, tongs, a slight sledge, a small
anvil, an open coal fire and small sized
bar iron, round and square, cut into
short pieces. The little blacksmith will
have a leather apron and will wear old
clothes because of the sparks.
The entire outfit will rot cost much,
and If desired this cost can be decreased
by getting a square block of cast iron
from some foundry instead of buying
an anvil.
It matters little what the boy may
attempt to make, he is bound to use
every muscle in his body. It is well
known that the left arm and shoulder
muscles are exercised less than the
right side, but the young iron worker
will grip hi3 tongs with his left fin
gers, and every time he strikes a ham
mer blow he will instinctively oppose
it with the muscles of his left arm!
The mere act of hammering will bring
into play all the muscles of his right
arm, back, loins and chest, for he will
work stooping over.
He will be directed to heat his Iron
and then make a square bend. This
is not so simple as it looks, and his
first attempt will result in a curved
hook. After a few lessons he will be
required to point one end of a square
bar, and so he will be led along until
he can circle a light bar around the
horn of the anviL
Progressive educators have taken
note of these results from manual
training, and some of them have de
cided that blacksmithing contains
more possibilities for physical and
mental good to boys than any other
trade. They reason that it is boy na
ture to love action and noise, particu
larly when noisy action is brought
into play to make things. The ring
ing of the anvil, the clang of metal
striking metal and the activity re
quired of one who is working with
red hot iron give the boy the action
and noise v.-hich appeal to his nature.
It also has been observed by those
who intend fitting up miniature black
smith shops for youngsters that iron
workers who handle the heated metal
are, as a rule, strong, healthy men,
above the average intelligence. Black
smiths, rolling mill men, iron molders,
puddlers, steelmakers all measure
well above the average in physical
and mental strength. It would seem
that iron enters the very blood and
tissues of those who handle It: that
it imparts Its characteristics to those
who subdue it.
Blacksmithing for the physical and
mental culture of boys is the latest
proposition advanced by educators. It
is proposed to use the fire, anvil,
tongs and hammer of the iron craft
to build up boy muscle and develop
boy mind; ax the same time. Observ
ing teachers and parents have noticed
the fascinating influence which the
blacksmith's shop holds for, the
average boy. Principals of manual
training schools have seen physically
weak lads transformed into active,
.sturdy boys .after a year's course, in
the school workshop. The. training of
the hands to use tools also has trained
the mind along conservative lines, and
the muscular energy expended has de
veloped physical strength-

' 1118 Broadway, March 6.
The body of a man that had commit
ted suicide under unexplained circum
stances was found this forenoon at
Arden. a railroad station near Newark
on the narrow-gauge road to San Jose.
Evidence of poisons that might have
been taken by the unidentified despond
ent was brought to light in the shape of
two vials, one of which had contained
cocaine and the other hydrochloric
acid. The remains were taken to Cen
ferville by Deputy Coroner Francis.
The vials were labeled from Jorgen
son's drug store, Kearny^and Wash
ington streets. San Francisco^ Besides
these there was found in the pockets a
number of surgical instruments and
dental appliances. Thrre was a belief
expressed by Deputy Coroner Francis
that the decedent might have been a
dentist, the instruments, as well as
the empty vials, pointing to that. Both
cocaine and the acid are used by dent
ists, the acid being utilized extensively
in cleaning plates.
Any papers or other clews that might
lead to identification had been de
stroyed"^ gotten rid of before the
man ended his life. ,
The body was that of a middle-aged
man, perhaps 43 years old. and of Ger
man cast of features. He was sandy
of complexion, light brown mustache,
weight about 200 pounds. The clothing
was of good material.
Deputy Coroner Francis will hold the
body for identification.

Some time during the night David
Tisch, 672 Twenty-fourth street, enter
tained a burglar unawares, who went
out by -'the front window with $34 of
Tisch's money. J. T. Roach, 662 Twen
ty-fourth street, a neighbor of Tisch,
also had a call from presumably the
same thief, who departed likewise by
the front window with $15. At neither
place did the burglar touch Jewelry
that could have been his for the taking.
The police were notified.
At O. H. Beer'a residence, 930 Myrtle
street, the burglar called at 1:30 o'clock
this morning, entering by way of a
front window. Beer was awakened, but
only in time to see his uninvited guest
disappear through the open window.
Beer's loss'was the $3 and the watch
and chain.
In two of the houses ransacked Jew
elry in plain sight was passed by and
nothing was taken but money. The
third home entered yielded only $3 in
coin, so the burglar eked out by taking
the watch and chain. v
Discriminating burglars with an eye
mainly for the coin of the realm paid
three more or less profitable visits to
Oakland residences last night, but,
luckily for the householders, {he intrud

silver watch and chain on the side.

"If th*; present activity keeps up this
year will be better than last, and 1903
was the best year in the history of
Oakland for real estate."
William J. Laymance said: "There
has been a general advance in all de
partments of the realty market, and
property values and rents were never
in better condition than at present, and
plans are being prepared for several
more large business buildings which
will afford mere room for stores. Much
outside capital is coming into this city
for investment, probably more than
*ver before at this season of the year.
This influx Is largely due to the fact
that the San Francisco Call is running
the news from this city in all editions
of the paper and letting people in other
parts of California and in other States
know what is going on here. I have
met several business men who came to
Oakland from outside the State and
who have since located here, who have
told me that their attention was first
tailed to this city by the Alameda
County news printed in The Call."
said: # -
"The regular spring business is just
commencing now and the market is
exceptionally good. Quite a good deal
of outside capital is coming in and we
have many inquiries for business and
residence property, with but few offer
ings at present, as owners seem in
clined to hold on and await the open
ing of the summer market. Desirable
business and manufacturing sites are
hard to secure, and it is almost impos
sible to get enough houses to supply
ihÂ» demands of incoming renters.
Real estate dealers report that the
market, during the two months Just
passed, has far exceeded ali expecta
tions, and they say that if business
keeps up as it has begun, this Â¦will
be the greatest year for real estate
ever known in the history of the city.
Although early in the year, much
building is already being done, and
many more structures will be be
gun as soon as the weather settles.
One large contract for the erection
of ten houses on Apgar street was
recently filed by C. T. Johns, who has
let the contract to C. M. MacGregor.
The ten houses will cost $15,594. In
spite of the large amount of building
which has been done during the .win
ter and the early spring, prospective
renters find it difficult to secure
houses of any description, and nearly
every structure which is built to rent
Is taken before it is completed.

Oakland Real Estate Association, in

A resolution indorsing the action
of the City Council in deciding to sub
mit a proposition to the citizens of
Oaklasd to issue bonds for needed

by the Oakland Real Estate Asso

The plans for the proposed lake
park between Eighth and Twelfth
streets were examined and the
members considered the allowance
made in UÂ»e proposed bond issue very
reasonable in proportion to the im
portance of the improvement. The
members of the Oakland Real Es

ple of Oakland realize the need of
public Improvements and they are
satisfied that the bonds -will carry.

says:
"To-day being Shrove Tuesday, the
time-honored custom of tossing the
pancake was again observed at West
minster School, in the presence of a
considerable number of visitors. As in
previous years, the ceremony took
place in the large hall. Shortly before
1 o'clock the scholars were assembled
under the direction of the headmaster
in the hall, those selected to compete
for the prize of 1 guinea, which goes
to the boy who secures either the
whole or the largest part of the pan
cake, being drawn up in order at the
entrance end of the hall beneath the
bar over which the pancake is tossed.
The other boys were stationed on the
far side of the bar, and eagerly fol
lowed the proceedings. At 1 o'clock the
school cook, in his white apron and
cap. and bearing In his hand the pan
containing the pancake, entered the
hall, preceded by the dean's verger.
Marching to the far side of the bar,
and taking careful aim, he threw the
pancake over the bar to the other side.
A stern struggle took place for posses
sion of the cake, and eventually It was
secured by H. F. Saunders of the Sci
ence Sixth, who emerged from the
scramble with the largest piece in his
hand. He was loudly cheered as he
was led away by the dean's verger to
receive the guinea whicl. he had won."
If President Wheeler, for example,
should advocate the annual tossing of

So deeply rooted is the native love
for the strenuous life that the national
sports of other lands have been tried in
Japan. The Mikado, with many of the
imperial family, attends thÂ« annual
spring races in Yokohama: but nothing
in the line of imported sports so ap
peals to the Japanese as cycling and
baseball. Cycling clubs are scattered
all over the empire, thousands of
American bicycles spin across the isl

records and trophies out of native

on Admission day.
It is also proposed to run two special trains to St.
Louis to carry the great number of those who might be
expected to take part in a California celebration in the
exposition city. One train would start from San Fran
cisco and one from Los Angeles. The special trains
would carry only Native Sons, representatives of the
State government and writers for the California press.
Governor Pardee and all the members of the Grand
Parlor would be on one train. An application has been
made formally to the transportation companies for a low
rate to St. Louis and return.
In the text of that application it is set forth that "we
expect to organize the membership throughout the State
in order to have a large percentage participate in the
celebration upon California day. We believe that sev
eral thousand can be induced to make the trip providing
a very reasonable rate can be made by the transconti
nental transportation companies. If such rate can be
made we propose to arrange a parade, by Native Sons
exclusively, that will attract the attention of visitors from
all parts of the world, and in this connection we desire
to state that, with our twenty-five years of experience in
parades and public demonstrations, .we believe that the
people of your company, like the greater portion of th'a
people of California, will not ask for any better proof of
our ability to get up and manage. a successful parade and
demonstration."
The decision in this matter, rests with the Native Sons.
The proposition indicates that the younger men in the
order are alive to the benefits of having Califorina talked
about and that there are many among them who would
willingly give their time and spend their money to
achieve that end.
HR. McNOBLE, grand president of the Native Sons
of the Golden West, has just completed a tour of
â¢ the State, during which every parlor of the Native
Sons was visited, for the purpose of getting the opinion
of the members regarding the proposed celebration of
Admission day at the St. Louis Exposition. Mr. Mc-
Noble reports that three propositions have been sub
mitted to the Native Sons and that they seem to be
about evenly divided in their preferences. It was pro
posed either that there be a general celebration of Ad
mission day by the Native Sons at St. Louis, that there
be one celebration in California and one at St. Louis or
that the Native Sons be represented in St. Louis on
Admission day by numerous delegates.
McNoble says he is in favor of the first named
idea â to have a great Admission day demonstration at
St. Louis by the Native Sons. As this proposition is
novel to the general public, although it has been dis
cussed for some time by the Native Sons, much interest
will attach to the reason that Grand President McNoble
gives for his advocacy of it.
In the first place it would be a great advertisement
for California," he says.Â» It was voted at the last session
of the Grand Parlor that the order take part â how much
at that time not being determined â in the St. Louis Ex
position. It was also admitted that it would be appro
priate to have a California day at St. Louis, and Admis
sion day would seem to be the most appropriate for
making California manifest. A committee was ap
pointed by the Grand Parlor to ascertain material facts.
This committee consists of H. R. McNoble, Lewis E.
Aubury, H. C. Lichtenberger, Charles H. Turner, Charles
E. McLaughlin and James L. Gallagher. It has been
organized into sub-committees and has considered the
situation from various points of view. The committee
has not decided on the adoption of any plan for the Ad
mission day celebration in 1904 yet, but the liveliest in
terest exists among the Native Sons in the outcome of
the deliberations. '
The grand president says that to have the entire State
celebration in St. Louis would furnish an event concern
ing which there would be a vast amount of talk. The
newspapers of the entire United States would discuss
it. The proposition is to have the usual costumes, bears,
bear flags, floats, reproductions of early mining scenes,
etc.; indeed, to outdo any similar home attempt at typical
Califorina pageantry. If the celebration take place in
St. Louis several counties, among them Stanislaus,
Fresno and Merced, have promised to send a carload
of products each to St. Louis for gratuitous distribution
NATIVE SONS AT ST. LOUIS.
Attorney Garret M^Enerney sel
dom takes a case that is not of some
magnitude, except it is to oblige a
friend. He recently had a case in
the Superior Court which, though it
involved only a few dollars, interested
him because it was to right a wrong
done on old man, a friend of his. It
was an action to set aside a judgment
obtained against the old man by a
collector, which judgment robbed the
old man of his savings of a year.
McEnerney is blunt in his dealing
with people who take advantage of
the law to further their own ends
and has no hesitancy in using plain
language. It did not, therefore, sur
prise the court nor those present at
the hearing who knew McEnerney
when the attorney, after calling the
collector to the stand, said:
"Mr. Blank, what was the first
thing you did when you made up
your mind to shake down Mr. Jones?"
The bluntness of the question flus
tered the collector and he remained
flustered during the proceedings that
followed and the judgment he fraud
ulently obtained was set aside.
Flustered Some.

His Advice.
Murderous cranks, bent on the assassination of any
body in authority, appear to be an uncomfortably estab
lished feature of Washington public life. Wnen a fellow
has to wear a coat of mail and distort himself in a daily
effort to dodge bullets his impression that a public office
is a private snap is likely to be corrected.
"Who are you," I often feel like ask
ing a girl who expresses this wish,
"that you should put the desire to do
for self above the desire to do for so
ciety? Do you imagine that you are
helping society any by turning your
back upon that which upholds and con
serves it to gain for yourself a tem
porary thing not worth having? Do
you fancy that you are 'independent
and self-supporting when you take the
time which belongs to your home to
earn an amount which you could not
decently live upon without the help of
that home? It is not all of life to earn
money, my dear. It is nobler and bet
ter to earn a rounded, useful living in a
sense which makes your life a center of
helpfulness, your personality/ a key
stone in. some strong arcli of the great
social structure."
The restless, uneasy desire to be out
and doing something for herself, which
so often possesses the young girl who
has not yet got her bearings toward
life, is a thing to be held in check". It
must be examined critically before it
is pronounced good." It is not neces
sarily a wholesome or desirable im
pulse, any more than a habit of inor
dinate novel reading is desirable as
showing one to be intellectual or a true
book lover.
To begin with, this idea of Independ
ence is In Ittelf fallacious. It is like the
little boy's description of a certain road
which he was asked about. "It don't
go nowhere, and if it did there ain't
nothing there." The notion that a girl
at work in any of the avenues usually
<jj>en to her and for the average wages
laid is independent is stultifying to the
intellect. The girl who feels that in
such work she is better off and more
erlf- 1 effecting than in her father's
home is stupid, or has not grasped the
fundamental idea of pelf-respect. She
nay be earning enough to satisfy her
wants if these are reduced to the low
Â«?*t possible torms; she .may feel freer
away from the restraint of home, but
instead of being independent she is in
curring a moral debt to the community
which she can never discharge. Her
so-called independence is, for the most
part, only indulged self-will. She has
turned her back upon a place in which
society needs her to enter one which
curtails her own time and opportunity
and which tends to lessen the opportu
nities and the earnings of others to
gain that which profits not.
Society does not need the girls. By so
ciety I mean the body social, which
makes up communities. It needs them
in the gatherings for social intercourse,
and it needs them in the work of pre
serving the social state. This is the
work of women. They are the con
servators of socipty, as men are its
builders. The home sense becomes
dulled by disuse, yet the home sense,
th* home-making talent 1 in women, is
the very bone and substance of the so
cial state.
She feels dependent upon her
father and mother because they give
her food and shelter. She is a pÂ°or
Eort of daughter who cannot make
a more than adeauate return for that:
But she wants, forsooth, to be "in
dependent-" The idea of what they
consider economic independence is
curiously fascinating to many girls.
The independence bacillus is even
busier among girls than is the the
atrical one. and it inoculates its vic
tims with a far vainer delusion. The
Ftage-J,truck period of a girl's life is
usually brief, but the yearning to go
to work for starvation wages, there
by lo feel independent. is usually
Â« urable only by large and bitter doses
of experience which leave lasting
traces en character.
Now, this dear girl not only has a
home, but a good one She is needed
in it. moreover â a daughter always is
needed. Her social position is good
in her pniall community; a horse and
buggy at hrr disposal when she needs
it and her music teaching gives her
enough money to clothe herself nice
ly without taking her tod often from
heme. What more does she want?
What does she mean by being inde
pendent â on the salary of a. sales
woman, or a clerk in an office?
I received a letter recently from a
young: girl living in the country. She
writes that sh*> is living at home and
leaching music in her village; but
that Fhe is weary of the monotony
of country life. She wants to come
to the city and become independent.
Fhe says she knows she could not
teach music in town; her attainments
are not sufficient (not a word about
wanting to study in the city). She
afkF if I can advise her. about get
ting a position in an office or a store.
Â£he is sure she could give satisfaction
as a saleswoman.

for the irregular, illegal part. They
kept in their room at the Hotel Europe
a bag of hard, cold cash in golden
rubles. This cash they doled out in In
stallments, first to this Prince, then to
that Count, for "influence." Each time
they handed out the money they were
told that their proposition had been
found good, and promises were made
that the concession would be speedily
granted. Each time the would-be con

they were disappointed and had to re
fill the money bag. The wearisome dÂ»
lay in the negotiations continued week

was returned with all legal formalities,
but considerably more than that sum
was left in the hands of the Princes
and Counts. Such has been the experi
ence of many other Americans seeking
to do business in Russia, each in sheer
desperation abandoning his enterprise.

Less is heard off cotton, too, though the market is
still unusually active and attracting a good deal of at
tention. The situation in coffee is similar to that in pro
visions. The collapse of the upward movement, which
began with a legitimate basis of low prices during the
closing months of 1903, is due to an inevitable reaction
from a vast and feverish speculation. The liquidation of
this particular speculation was enormous during Febru
ary, so much so that not only have the plungers come to
grief, but the regular dealers have become scared off
the market and are purchasing no more than they actu
ally need, and even then with more or less trepidation.
So much for plunging in the necessaries of daily life.
These, as well as stocks, burn the fingers. But if the
American will insist on speculating and rushing reck
lessly into trading arenas where angels fear to tread,
he must take his medicine' when it is handed out to him
with a leaden spoon, as it always is, later on.
The American money and stock markets continue in
the same condition/as for some weeks past, both being
quiet and featureless. The former is easy, with plenty
of funds at reasonable rates, and the latter is flat. The
public still refuses to romp with the Wall-street tiger,
and as a stock market without the public is like the play
of Hamlet with the character of Hamlet left out, there is
of course no business worth talking about. The war,
too, has its effect, by depressing the foreign bourses,
which unfavorably affect our own stock market through
sympathy, so the stock exchanges all over the world
are at present comparatively quiet places.
Such is the commercial and financial situation through
out the East. As will be seen, it is the reverse of sen
sational. The situation in California remains as for
weeks, with the exception that the recent copious rains
in the northern half of the State and in parts ot the San
Joaquin Valley have placed the country in most excellent
condition for farm work and given us prospects of splen-'
did crops, upon which we are how; basing estimates for
another year of prosperity. Our banks have all the
money necessary, the light stocks of grain, hay, hops,
dried fruits and other products of our soil, on which we
depend so largely for our prosperity, practically, assure
us of good prices for our 1904 crops, and what more do
we want? Our local and export trade are both keeping
up well, real estate transactions are numerous and large,
building operations are active and the great influx of the
new population of homeseekers continues. The last is
the best sign of the times we have. If the railroads con
tinue . their present broad and intelligent policy of at
tracting homeseekers to this coast by means of reduced
rates of transportation, we shall be surprised, when the
next census is taken, to see how the State has grown.
And our increased population will make ' us stronger,
richer, more famous and more important among the
States.
In spite of this falling off in the volume of business,
however, collections are reported good in almost all parts
of the country, and funds are plentiful everywhere. The
failures, while more numerous than in 1903, are as a rule
not large, and none of them have been sufficiently seri
ous to cause apprehension.
The current speculation in staples, alluded to last
week, continues, but is abating and no longer feverish.
In provisions it has begun to wane, as the outside spec
ulators have at last woke up to what everybody except
themselves has seen for a month, that they have been
eagerly buying high-priced goods which the great West
ern packers have been industriously unloading on the
greedy and unreasoning purchasers. The speculators now
find themselves carrying a load of pork and beef prod
ucts over which they can ruminate at their leisure and get
rid of as best they may.
THE chief feature of trade last week was the marked
backwardness of the season. This has been ap
parent for several weeks, but last week it was es
pecially pronounced. Deep snow in many parts of the
country and extremely cold weather almost everywhere
except on the Pacific Slope have respectively retarded
transportation on railroads and country roads and thus
impeded the distribution of goods and deferred the de
mand for spring goods, which should have opened sev
eral weeks ago.
These unfavorable features are reflected by the coun
try's bank clearings, which showed a decrease for the
week of 18.2 per cent, with almost all the very large
cities in the column of losses. The decrease at New
York was 28.8 per cent, and while much of it was prob
ably due to the lack of activity in Wall street, it cannot
be gainsaid that the holding off of the usual spring de
mand for merchandise was the cause of a good deal of
it. Pittsburg, which reflects the condition of the iron and
steel industry, fell x>ff 24.4 per cent; Chicago, the center
of the grain and provision trade, lost 4.5 per cent; Balti
more, probably on account of her recent fire, 25.2 per
cent, and San Francisco 18.3 per cent. New Orleans,
owing to the continued large cotton speculation there,
gained 30.9 per cent. The aggregate clearings made a
little better showing than last week, though they were
still below the two billion mark, being $1,967,687,000.
The failures for the week were 236, against 229 last year.
The above exhibit is unfavorable. It may be almost
wholly due to the inclement weather, and such is the gen
eral opinion expressed in the regular weekly commer
cial reports from all over the country. The opinion is
also general that with the return of good weather the
deferred spring demand will appear and business resume
its suspended activity. Another condition, illustrating
the effect of unfavorable weather upon trade, is found
in the railway earnings, which show a loss of 2.2 per
cent in February as compared with last year. For five
years or so these railway earnings have shown a uniform
gain over the preceding year, but some months ago the
increase began to diminish and now they are showing
an actual loss. Â¦ "
Judge Henry A. Melvin of- Oakland,
who returned from New York Tuesday
evening, has recruited his stock of good
Stories. Here Is one he tells:
"My fried Captain Champe S. An

In the art of story telling. He told one
on Mr. Purdy of the New York bar and
former Recorder Smythe. Purdy was
defending a man before a jury in Re
ccrder Smythe's court and the case had
reached that stage when It became
proper for defendant's counsel to ad
dress the jury. Rising and placing his
hand on the defendant's head, Mr. Pur
dy said: 'Gentlemen of the jury, my
unfortunate friend is a soldier of the
king!'
!* 'What's that?' roared the Recorder,
who was a stickler for decorum and
frowned upon any attempts to go out
side the record.
"Nothing abashed, Mr. Purdy replied:
â¢I am glad your honor did not hear, for
it gives me a chance to say again that
my unfortunate client is a soldier of
the king, and I mean, your honor. King
Alcohol!'
"He then proceeded successfully to
convince the jury that long-continued
excesses had made the defendant In

A brief experiment will suffice to set
forebodings aside. Get into weather
proofs and take a twelve-mile tramp
through mud or wet snow the next
rainy day, and notice the result on
those problematic swellings. Ten to
one that they have not only subsided,
but vanished, and will not reappear for

scared off so easily, and its appear

serious heart troubles, or of the liver

temperance.
The grip ("grippe"), alias influenza,
is fast becoming a synonym of catarrh.
"Caught the grip, poor fellow," remark
the neighbors of an American citizen
who is confined to his bed as a result
of exposure to the vitiated air of auc
tion room or crowded streetcar. The
patient accepts the explanation, to
gether, perhaps, 'with gifts of cough
candy, etc., but. instead of being be
wailed, ought often to be congratu
lated o-n his total lack of acquaintance
with the grip of the actual grippeâ
"influenza." influencing a victim's sys
tem for years, and, like caviar, import
ed genuine only from the depths qt
darkest Russia. Its sources of supply
are the crowded and unspeakably
squalid hovels of the East Russian
boors, in the treeless steppes, whtre
animal warmth Is made to supply the
scarcity of fuel, and where a dozen
rustics often crowd into a twelve by
twenty cabin to fuddle with quass, or
dry their reeking furs on a smolder
ing brick stove stuffed with peat. Be
fore the end of winter a dug-out of
that description becomes an arsenal of
lung microbes, and early in the spring
the accumulations explode in the form
of pulmonary epidemic. . Sweeping from
town to town the conflagration gath
ers Btrength, till its sparks travel
whole continents, and after a brief
chilling in the damp of the -ocean fer
ries, blaze forth again on- the west
shores of the Atlantic. â¢
Kut the misgivings caused by an oc
casional trace of pulmonary hemor
rhage can generally be settled by home
diagnosis and a few pertinent ques
tions: Alcoholic excesses? Overexer
tion? Region of the chest injured by
fall or blow? No night fever? No
hereditary predisposition to lung dis
eases? It isn't consumption then.
Dropsy is not rarely simulated by
swellings that may indicate nothing
worse than a transient irregularity in
the action of the heart. Ill-compound
ed blood, in the form of a watery fluid,
is deposited here .-.nd there about the
region of the main Joints; the feet es
pecially become swollen to- an extent
that obliterates the intervals of the
sinews, and can be felt more or less
perceptibly by the tension of the ex
panded skin. One very frequent pre
disposing cause is physical inactivity,
following protracted periods of active,
outdoor life.
Disregard of the warning, indeed,
may develop tuberculosis in that spe
cially horrid form known as galloping
consumption.
Hemorrhage is a suspicious but not
altogether conclusive symptom. Con-
Fumptives have been known to perish
of a gradual decline without ever hav
ing noticed more than a faint admix
ture of blood in their sputa. On the
other hand, blood-spitting can be
brought en by the irritation of alco
holic excesses.
The health inspector called the next
morning. Should he confess? Not if
he could help it. Much easier to pose
as a victim of neglected sanitation.
Only on the third day his wife discov
ered the enormous deficit of wurst, and
to obviate a sanitary blockade com
municated her suspicions and at once
straightened out the tangle of grew
some conjectures. ..
Chronic catarrhs are still oftener
mistaken for more>erious disorders.
Sleeping night after night in an illy
ventilated microbe den at last over
comes the resisting power of the
stoutest organism. The lungs begin to
fester and nature has to remove the
wasted tissues by the expurgative
process known as cough and expecto
ration. The risk of a final aggravation
always exists, but. even after a year'3
persistence. catarrhs will yield
promptly to the specific of natureâ a
liberal supply of pure airâ cold pure
air preferred.
Tuberculosis, in all but the last part
of the development, admits of the same
remedy, but recovery is less rapid; the
deep-eaten sores have to heal before
the cough stops altogether. Consump
tion can also be recognized by the fre
quency of night fevers and an abnor
mal increase of temperature above a
100 degrees Fahrenheit every evening in
some cases. But the two most char
acteristic symptoms of consumption
are the hectic flush, glaring on the
cheeks of the patient's otherwise pallid
face, and the steady progress of ema
ciation. The muscles shrink: the con
gested lungs are no longer able to ful
fill their proper functions in the work
of blood manufacture, and the starved
system has to fall Lack upon its re
serve stores.
Fevers, closely resembling some
forms of typhoid, are often induced by
dietetic excesses, and I remember the
case of a glutton who caused an epi
demic scare by concealing his freaks
from a board of health officers. Coming
home too late for supper and finding
that his wife had stepped out for a
chat with a neighbor, he revenged him
self by raiding the pantry and devour
ing about a yard of stale liver sausage,
berides cabbage and pickles. After
midnight he bacame very uncomfort
able and the next morning felt the ap
proach of a fever. Rest and a day's fast
would have allayed the domestic panic,
but the mystified doctor remembered
complaints about contamination of the
wcter supply and ordered the patient
to bed. Closed windows and a red
hot stove completed the mischief, and
before night they h%d him in delirium,
and the neighborhood gossips in a
shriek-and-cackle sensation.
Patients of all classes are now and
then apt to be more candid with them
selves than with their doctor. "The
devil knows what made him bald
headed," says a Spanish proverb; but
even baldheaded deacons might hesi
tate to confide such secrets to their
medical advisers.
We are ofthe opinion that the enlightenment that will
follow these disclosures will weaken the Mormon
hierarchy. It will not destroy the church, but will take
out of its practice the mysteries and secret ways, and
conform it more to human reason and common sense.
heard of it, he went to Nauvoo and "saw" Hyrum Smith
for a democratic revelation. On election day Baker got
one vote in Nauvoo and Hoge got the rest, and was
elected. Baker was "indignant and taxed Joseph Smith
with bad faith. But the prophet declared that under the
rules of the game the last revelation bound every mem
ber of the church except the one to whom the first reve
lation was made, and claimed that he had kept faith by
voting for Baker. Hoge claimed the distinction of being
the only man who was ever elected to Congress by di
rect revelation.
Again the church has a Smith at its head, and he dis
courses interestingly aod under oath about revelation.
He says that a revelation may be followed or not, as
one is inclined. , It is' evident that the revelation busi
ness is a fast and loose affair. The revelation enjoining
plural marriage was obeyed in a spirit of resignation and
alacrity. But the later revelation in 1890, canceling it,
when the divine source of revelation got wind of the
Tucker-Edmunds law, has not been accepted with gen
eral pleasure.
The gentile world will be surprised that the Mormon
President looks upon revelation so lightly. But all must
concede the convenience of the system. If a prophet get
a distasteful revelation, he waits till the ticker grinds out
another more agreeable to him, and then becomes obe
dient.

of armor-i>lated cruisers now existing
in any navy. The perfection of that
model of ship is, to my mind, un
doubted. I congratulate the valiant

The fact is, we have had to suspend
work on the wreck for a few days until
the water clears. Three days ago my
divers went down and walked about
the deck of the vessel without difficulty,
but yesterday the water was so muddy
tnat they could see nothing. It was
pitch dark down there, and this made
it so dangerous that we decided to wait
till the black water from the Sacra
mento freshet passes and the blue
water comes back again.
"I sent down three divers yestrday,"
Collins continued, under gentle probing
cs to what he was finding below the
surface of the bay. "They brought up
a heavy piece of iron which one of them
stumbled over on the deck. It was ap
parently a piece of a deck pump, such as
may have been used on the Rio. One of
my men was down forty- five minutes
yesterday. This is about as long as
any one can stay down at that depth.
The deck of the Rio Is about sixty-five
or seventy feet below low tide, so the
pressure on a diver in armor is terrific.
Then the current down there is like a
gale above sea. It is so strong that a
diver can keep his feet only with the
greatest difficulty. The task, as any
one can see, is made much greater by
the darkness. The men are constantly
in danger of being swept off the deck
and over the side of the vessel. This
might result in getting their lines and
air tubes tangled up and making it
impossible for them to reach the sur
face again. Hence without better, fa
cilities it is impossible for us to pro

Collins was found later at his home
suffering from a severe cold contracted
in the hard work and frequent wettings
Involved in his wrecking enterprise. He
Is a man of BO years, a native of St.
John, N. B., and a familiar figure on
the San Francisco water front for
many years. After quitting the sea he
was employed for a long period as a
cable splicer for the street railways.
He was greatly surprised to learn that
his connection with the attempt to
salve the Rio had become known. Evi
dently he had tried to keep it a secret,
and beyond admitting the bare fact
that he believed he had discovered the
whereabouts of the lost vessel he was
disinclined to talk when seen last even
ing.
DIFFICULTIES OF WORK.
The supposed position of the Rio's
hull at present is clearly indicated by
four buoys the wreckers have station
ed about 700 yards off the shore. These
can easily b<? seen with a glass either
from the beach or from the bluffs
above. The buoys are anchored with
strong cables and form a quadrilateral
several hundred yards ' in dimension.
They are about 200 yards northwest of
the largest of the two rocks that rise
conspicuously above the water south
west of Fort Point. Some of these
buoys have been In place for a fort
night. During this time divers have
made frequent descents, they say, to
the deck of a vessel, which they now
declare Is without doubt the Rio.
The man that claims the honor of
solving the mystery surrounding the
dead ship's resting place is John Col
lins, an ex-sailor, who now follows the
calling of a rope splicer and lives at
2519 Larkin street. So much was learned
by The Call's representative from the
Presidio guards who patrol the beach
below Fort Point. These guards, as
well as the men connected with the
life-saving station at this spot, have
been h:terej?ted spectators for some
days of the operations of the men on
the launch, who daily came and an
chored at the same place and finally
sent down divers that were seen to
bring up pieces of wreckage. They are
all convinced that the Rio has been lo
cated.
WHERE THE SHIP LIES.
The probability that the wreck of the
Pacific Mail steamship Rla de Janeiro
has been located off Fort Point, as told
exclusively in yesterday's Call, was the
principal topic of conversation along
the city front and among shipping and
marine insurance men throughout the
day. The report was generally ac
cepted as credible and In line with the
best theories as to the whereabcruts of
the Iiulk and its ultimate recovery. It
was pointed out that no other vessel
had sunk In the vicinity of the point
In many years, so that if any wreck
has been discovered at that part of the
harbor it is doubtless that of the Rio.
The Call yesterday located the men
that are at the head of the undertaking
to salve the cargo and if possible the
ship herself. They tell a circumstan
tial story of their work to date and
claim that, although little progress has
yet been made toward raising cargo,
they have found and brought to the
surface pieces of wreckage bearing the
name of the great trans-Pacific steam
er that went on the rocks in the dense
fog of early morning 'on February 22,
1901. Laboring under some uncertainty
as to their rights in the matter, the
wreckers were reluctant yesterday to
speak In detail as to their plans for the
future, and what was learned was in
the way of admission rather than a
willing statement of their purposes.
A visit to Viscato beach yesterday
afternoon discovered several matters
bearing on the supposed finding of the
Rio. None of the wreckage strewn
along the sKore south of Fort Point
showed the name of the missing vessel,
but several pieces of painted wood
were found which residents of the
neighborhood and at the cliff at once
pronounced similar to pieces picked up
along the beach for days after the loss
of the Rio. These are painted red on
one side and are covered with a heavy
white enamel on the other.' At the
time of the disaster such pieces when
found at the seaside were described as
fragments from some of the Rio's boats
that were broken to piece3 in the dis
aster. _
If Collins has really discovered the
Rio, as he firmly believes, he and his
partners are doubtless in a way to
make a handsome stake. The rights
of salvors in such a case were stated
last night to The Call by Charles Page
of Page, McCutchen & Knight, attor
neys. Mr. Page is well known as an
authority upon maritime law, and his
connection with the litigation over the
Rio as counsel for the ship owners
especially qualifies him to speak on
the case in point. He said:
"Whoever finds the Rio will be en
titled to salvage on so much of the
ship and her cargo as he may be able
to recover. The legal title to both ship
and cargo remains in the owners as
before the wreck, except as effected by
insurance. If the insurance companies
paid a total loss on either ship or
cargo then they are holders of the legal
title to the ship, if saved, or the cargo,
if raised. My recollection is that the
ship was not insured at all, while the
cargo was insured and paid for by the
companies as a total loss.
"If I am correct In this then the
salvors would look to the Pacific Mail
Steamship Company for salvage on so
much of the ship as might be recov
ered and to the owners of the cargo, If
anything of value is raised from the
hold. The courts would act as arbiter
on all questions of value and after
awarding the salVors their expenses
would allow them a liberal share of the
value of their recovery."
The possibilities of salvage on the
cargo of silks, rice, tea and opium car
ried by the Rfo on her fatal voyage
are, of course, small after three years
under water. The wreckers, however,
are counting on the recovery of the
bullion which they believe to have been
in the ship when she went down. Im
mediately after the wreck the amount
of this was stated to have been $600,
000. The Pacific Mall officials have
denied that any specie was aboard the
Rio on her last voyage, but a large
part of the public has steadfastly re
fused to accept this denial, and Collins
and his fellow wreckers are working In
hopes of recovering a fortune in coin
which, they are sure, now lies at thâ¢
bottom of the Golden Gate.
POSSIBLE PROFITS.
"The public is welcome to all It can
learn about this thing, but I do not
intend to make our plans" known."
Collins showed some uncertainty as
to his rights in the matter of salving
the Rio or her cargo and said he was
in doubt as to the attitude of the Gov
ernment toward such an enterprise.
He had visited several marine insur
ance offices, he declared, but could
get no information, as to any claims
upon the ship or cargo that might be
made by the companies. His new boat
is in charge of Captain John Ross, a
well-known water front man, who was
formerly in the employ of the White
law Wrecking Company and thus has
some experience in similar work. '
Collins' other partners in the un
dertaking include a diver named
Eloise and other persons of small capi
tal. Collins himself gave as little in
formation about them as possible, say
ing:
"Now, if we are to succeed in our
enterprise we must have the best pos
sible facilities for our work. I worked
for a time with a launch called the
Gazelle, but that was too small, and I
have just got a new and larger boat.
I intend to fit up this craftf with all
the latest appliances for wrecking, in
cluding electric lights for submarine
work and the very beet air pumps and
the like. It is too soon to tell whether
we shall need to pump sand out of
the hold. My work up to the present
time has been confined to making such
exploration of the deck as we could
and to bringing up the few loose
articles found on it. Our facilities
were too limited to permit us to do
more, but we know where the Rio is
and have marked her position. Those
buoys you saw out there are anchored
down on each side of the wreck, not
fastened to the ship's mast9."
'COLLINS' PARTNERS.
"The ship is lying on her side,
wedged between two great rocks.
There is such a heavy list that it is
hard work walking on deck, which is
covered with mud and very slippery.
is the Rio., I made the discovery of
her location myself, after diving
around in different spot off the point.
I have always believed she was lying
off there near those rocks, and now I
have proved it. We have brought up
pieces of timber from the wreck that
bear the name of the ship in plain let

San Jonqiiin County Hopes Enterprise
NEW BOTTLE FACTORY.
Is' About to Be Established.
The Stockton Mail says that a bottle
factory may be built In San Joaquin
Ceunty. The following regarding the
matter is from that paper:
An expert in tlie work of constructing glass
factories has been investigating the facilities
not only here but in the northern part of the
county. He says that from the San Joaquin
River, tho Cateveras and the Mokelumne. sand
excellent for the manufacture of bottles. Casks
and the cheaper grades of glassware can be
obtained In any desired quantity and at nom
inal cost. The facilities are much better than
In San Francisco, where the bottle makers Im
port trend from Monterey.
The glass made from San Joaquin River sand
Is | especially valuable for champagne bottles,
as It lsÂ» strong and resistant. In his opinion it
is equal to that produced at Bordeaux, France,
where peroxide of iron Is mixed with white
glass rand to give It strength and Incidentally
the dark green color to be seen In champagne
bottles.
The Davlsvllle Enterprisa says that
the peach, prune and apricot trees In
Yolo County are the wonder of the
State, and that oranges In the county
ripen and reach market Very early. The
county Is about to perfect one of the
most comprehensive irrigation sys
tems in the country, which will pro
vide for the irrigation of more than
100.000 acres of rich soil. Good prices
for products are assured by the or
ganization of the Farmers' Protective
Association. Yolo County has a fine
climate. Its soil produces a great va
riety of fruits, vegetables and cerÂ»al3
to perfection.
TRINITY COUNTY MOVES.
Development Association Formed In

The Trinity County Development As
sociation has been organized with

as secretary, C. W. Bremer as treas
urer and D. J. Hall, Dr. D. B. Fields,
S. Karsky, R. L. Carter and J. H.
Boyce as directors. Twenty-five lead-
Ing men signed the roll at the first
meeting of the association. - It Is in
tended to advertise the county as much
as possiblef The Trinity Journal says:
The association will be general In Its char
acter and will embrace within Its scope every
section of Trinity County and every Industry
carried en. All mines, whether developed or
undeveloped, will be listed and accurate In
formation of, the same can be obtained at
headquarters. Also the agricultural and stock
raising Interests will be fully cared for. Among
ether things It is Intended that a prospective
Investor In any enterprise or business in the
county can obtain full Information regarding
the same at the office of the association with
out cost.
From time to time the association will pub
lish in pamphlet form full statistics concern
ing the county and distribute the same to
points whore they will do the most good, and
Trinity will thus be represented with other
counties of the State with a representation In
the important centers of the country.
The association will handle no properties and
will sain nothing from Us efforts other than
they, -as individuals, will be benefited by the
increased prosperity of the county.
Owing to the fact that the bulk of the re
sources of the county - He outside' of Weaver
ville, 'the benefit of the active and Intelligent
efforts of the association will redound chiefly
to the outlying . districts, and for this reason
there should be a large membership therefrom.
Owing to the regulations of the committee
having charge of the State exhibit at St. Louts
It will be Impossible for the county to parti
cipate therein, as there is not sufficient time to
gather and prepare a suitable exhibit.
IRRIGATION JUBILEE.
Modesto Plans Brave Show to Cele
brate Good Results of Labor.
.The Modesto Herald supplies some
facts relating to the irrigation jubilee
that will take place in Modesto In
April. It says:
It Is planned to have open air concerts and
addresses on the east side of the Courthouse
square.
Six or seven lines of six-foot and eight-foot
flags to each block, every second line draped,
and a line of the Jubilee, colorsâ orange, red
and purpleâ running down thÂ« center with the
course of the street, will contribute to the
cala attire of Modesto on the occasion of the
irrigation Jubilee, on Friday and Saturday,
April 22 and ' 23. The committee on decora
tion. Â£d J. Phetan chairman, has definitely
decided on this. They have night Illumination,
with varl-eolored electric light globes, yet to
be arranged for.
Nine blocks will be included in the scheme
of decoration, from the depot east to the end
of the Courthouse Park, on both' H and I
streets, and half a block south of II street and
half a- block north of I. Special decoration at
the depot, to embrace streamers of flags ami
Jubilee colors running from the big flagpole to
the telegraph poles on the west side of Front
street, are embraced In the scheme of decora
tion, and a spclal feature, yet to be definitely
determined, at thÂ© intersection of I and Tenth
streets, over the fountain. The decoration
and illumination of the Courthouse Park Is
also contemplated, and very likely the county
will make provision for the decoration of the
Courthouse.
"Another important thing for us to
have to attract people here is good
roads. Make our streets attractive by
planting palms and beautiful trees.
Make our country and mountain roads
wide and have them macadamized.
Have all mountain roads on an easy
gradeâ not steeper than five or six per
cent. Allow all kinds of vehicles to
traverse them. Another attraction
which we might establish here is a con
servatory of music. All these and many
other things accomplished and people
would visit us by thousands and men
of wealth from the cities would come
here. Invest in real estate and spend
hundreds of thousands of dollars In Im
provements. Let us take advantage of
our opportunities."
These remarks are indicative of the
practical purposes of the Board of
Trade. The board Is determined to do
good work and the handsome city of
Los Gatos is certain to thrive. If the
energy displayed In Improving it is
at all commensurate with Its very great
natural advantages.

At the third annual meeting of the
Santa Clara Commercial League Presi

on the part of business men. The
league has erected two signs, each ten

on the Menton tract, north, which will
advertise Santa Clara to the passing
tourist or the sojourner for a day. On
these signs is inscribed: "Central coast
counties. Santa Claraâ Noted for its
municipal ownership and educational
facilities." The signs 'also give the pop
ulation, the altitude and the mean tehi

made at the first meeting wa3 the
adoption of a memorial asking th^
Trustees of the city of Sacramento to
submit to the people a/propoaition to
authorize an issue of bonds in the sum,
of 5100,000 to provide for a new high
school building. The text of the reso
lution that found favor with the wom
en is a follows:
Revived. That the executive committee of
the Women's Council of Sacramento, repre
senting 230O women of the capital city, hereby
memorialize the honorable Board of City Trus
tees to submit to the people, alone and unre
lated to any other proposition, the question of
a bond issue for a new high school, the sum
of the bonds not to exceed $100,000.
At a meeting of the Sacramento
Chamber of Commerce the following
was adopted:
We, the directors of ths Sacramento Cham
ber of Commerce, bearing In mind the many
needs of the city, and after due consideration
o/ the order of lmi>ortance of clear water,
Â¦ewer system. City. Hall, etc., feel that all. or
perhaps the most Important, if there be. such,
would not carry If all were submitted to *.
vote of the people at once. The very magni
tude, of the. expenditure that would be neces
sary to give ua all these and a. high school la
addition would probably defeat each voter's
pet proposition In Its turn.
We feel that the proposition most apt trÂ»
carry at a bond election is that for & new
hlsh school. WÂ« know of no serious contro
versy as tÂ© thÂ» manner of providing one. It i*
certainly a pressing necessity and one which
win certainly be attended vary soon. If not
now. If the City Trustees will hasten to sub
mit the proposition we. promise to aid them in
every reasonable way within our power to
carry a bond issue of $200,000 or less.
We recommend to the City Trustees that an
option be obtained upon some such site as that
now occupied by the Orphan Asylum, and
that the site and the amount to bÂ« paid there
for be made a part of the. proposition, so that
the voters may know what la to bs done with
the portion of the bonds Issued to buy the
Important Themes Taken
Up in Wide Range
of Counties.
One of the most active and promising
organizations in Northern California
for the betterment of existing condi
tions is the Los Gatos Board of Trade.
With this article the pictures of its
wide-awake officers are given. H. D.
Curtis is the president; A. B. Smith,
vice preeident; Martin 'A. Lathrop,
secretary, and K. H. Erickson, treas
urer. The work of the Los Gatos
Board of Trade is to promote the wel
'fare of Los Gatos and tha^ surrounding
country as much as possible. In this
the officers, directors and members are
concerned.
The opening of the Interurban
electric road between Los Gatos
and San' Jose has stimulated
the expectations and reasonable
hopes of Los Gatos measurably.
In addition to the board of offi
cers mentioned in the foregoing, the
board has as directors E. L. Ford, Lee
Darneal and J. A. Tudor. Herbert E.
Law of San Francisco has interested
himself in the work of the Board of
Trade. At a recent banquet Mr. Law
spoke earnestly and made recommen
dations that are summed up substan
tially as follows:
Mr. Law's theme was "Opportunities
and Good Roads." He said it was cer
tain that Los Gatos was losing oppor
tunities. He recommended the culti
vation of flowers for perfumes at Los'
Gatos and said that a small tract de
voted to such a purpose would yield
greater returns in Los Gatos than many
a 60-acre fruit ranch. He found that
there were numerous opportunities at
Los Gatos for making various charm
ing walks and drives. The canyon
could be converted into a veritable
fairyland by trails, walks and pictur
esque foot bridges at intervals to cross
and recposs the stream.
"We are likely," he said "to be lulled
into Inactivity by our profusion of ad
vantages,. People will come here if they
have something to come for, if we have
something attractive. When they com-.'
to look at orange groves and palm
lined streets, let us be able to show
them what they have come to see. Show
them clean, attractive back yards along
the line of the railroad as well as beau
tiful front yards. Extend our sewer
system to every part of the town. That
Is one thing that prospective citizens*
will require to induce them to settle
here. \

Takes Advice From
H. E. Law.
BY A. S. WOODS.
The work of the Dunbar Club of the
Glen Ellen district has been praise
worthy. The club has a membership
of more ithan two-thirds of all the
farmers in a large^district that ex
tends ten miles north and south and
eight miles east and west, having the
villages of Glen Ellen and Kenwood
within Its boundaries. Meetings are
held once a month, at which com
mittees make reports and road and
other matters pertaining to the welfare
of the farmers are discussed.
An account of the procedure is of
interest as it may be of application'
in many communities similarly situated
in California. Besides effecting the im
provement of roads this club has se
cured a plat of land, about a quarter
of an acre in extent, in the hfjart of
Glen Ellen as the site of a public li
brary. It has applied to the postal au
thorities for free rural delivery of mails
and, at its' January meeting, put Itself
on record in favor of the Brownlow
bill for granting national aid for road
building.
METHODS OF WORK. '
The method of work Is this: Some one
who will be benefited by a change of
road or the Improvement desired first
makes application for the club's aid.
The applicant sets forth how the work
or change will benefit the public and
offers a resolution to have a committee
appointed to draw up a petition and
to get the signatures of interested par
ties to the same, and, when it Is neces
sary, to take the petition to the county
seat while the Supervisors are in ses
sion and present it.
A special meeting of the Dunbar
Club was held "on March 5 and the date
of a good roads convention to be held
in Glen Ellen was fixed. The gathering
will take place on April 30 for the pur
pose of formulating a recommendation
to the Legislature relative to new road
laws such as the convention may think
to be best for the people. This action
will be taken in accordance with the
recommendations of the Sonoma Coun
ty Grand Jury. The delegates to the
convention will be the Boc-rd of Super
visors and all ex-Superviaors residing
In the county, members of the Grand
Jury, members of the late Grand
Jury, Trustees of the several incorpor
ated cities in Sonoma County, delegates
from each improvement club, delegates
from each grange, all members and
ex-members of the Legislature residing
in Sonoma County and the County Sur
veyor and ex-County Surveyors. The
Importance of the movement to Sonoma
County Is apparent.
TWO YEARS OF' SERVICE.
Since the organization of the Dun
bar Improvement Club, two years ago,
many important improvements have
been made on the roada. The changes
and work now being considered for this
district will be of lasting benefit if suc
cessfully carried out.
The basis of distribution of the $24,
000,000 to be appropriated by the terms
of the Brownlow bill would give Cali
fornia $430,000 in three years from the
national treasury for the public high
ways in this State. The conditibn is
that a like amount fehall be expended
by the people of the State for roads.
The bill is strongly favored by the Dun
bar Improvement Club, j
Good roads are of great importance
to California farmers. The Dunbar
Improvement Club has proved Its good
faith In this regard by Its deeds. As
an instance, there was an old wooden
bridge crossing Calabezas Creek, on
the Santa Rosa and Sonoma
road one mile north of Glen Ellen. A
new wooden bridge was proposed. The
Dunbar Improvement Club was against
such a temporary makeshift. A stone
bridge has been cpnstructed at the
place mentioned, on the site of the old
wooden structure, and not one foot of
lumber was used In Its construction.
The foundations were built In the bed
rock. Great interest will be taken in
the coming convention for good roads
In this county.
Bad roads, like the poor, may always
be with us, for however much aid may
be secured for road-building purposes,
there never can be sufficient money
raised to make all the thoroughfares of
the country good, although most of
them can be made much better than
they are. A physician, when called upon
recently at a meeting of the Woman's
Club of Sonoma to give his views, said
that he did not think the roads of the
present were very bad.
In early days the roads near Sonoma
were so bad during the rainy season
that he took his saddle along with
him in his buggy so that If he
got stalled he could continue on
his way on horseback. He did not tell
his fair auditors what he did when,
after mounting the horse and riding
a short distance farther, the animal
got mired. With such an expenditure
as there is annually on the roads, they
should be better than they were In
early days.
Information is had from a reliable
source of a valuable horse that- was
lost while being ridden over a private
road near Kenwood a few years ago.
Two young men were out on horseback
looking for stray stock. One was riding
a little in advance of the other when
his horse plunged forward into what
appeared to be a pool of water. By the
assistance of his companion the, rider
of the animal was assisted from his
dangerous position on the horse, but
the horse was suffocated.

BATTLESHIPS PURCHASED FROM CHILE BY GREAT BRITAIN
REMARKABLE FOR SPEED ATTAINED ON LIGHT TONNAGE
Naval Officers and Experts Are Dis
cussing This Achievement of Sir
Edward Reed, the Designer.
Prior to 1S99 the length of guns ranging from 6
inches to 13 inches were from 30. to 4 0 calibers. The
models of 1899, designed by the present chief of the Bu
reau of Ordnance, increased the length of the twelve-inch
and ten-Inch guns from 35 to 40 calibers; the eight-inch
from 40 to 45 calibers, the t>he six, five, four and three
inch guns were lengthened to 50 calibers. The increased
length enabled heavier charges to be used, thus increasing
the velocity of the projectile, its range and penetrative
power. Thus the twelve-inch gun of 35, caliber, with a
charge of 550 pounds of brown powder, having a muzzle
velocity of 2100 foot seconds, was increased to 40 caliber
length and using a 350-pound charge of smokeless powder
attained a muzzle velocitv of 2800 foot seconds. Xow
the charge is to be reduced so as to decrease the velocity
from 2800 to 2700 foot, and that of the older twelve-inch
guns from 2250 to 2100 foot seconds.
It is especially the older guns in which a material
reduction of charges are to be made, the eight-inch guns
having their initial velocities decreased from 2300 foot to
2100 foot seconds, and the six-inch guns from 2400 foot
to 2150 foot seconds. The effect of this diminution of
powder charges will place United States naval ordnance
pretty low in the scale of effectiveness as compared with
French, German and British guns. Thus the Canet twelve
inch gun has a striking force of 53,500 tons; the Krupp
twelve-inch gun develops 59,200 tons and the Elswick
jjun of like caliber has a striking force of 48,800 tons.
The United States twelve-inch gun with reduced charge
will have a striking force of only about 43,000 foot tons.
It is apparent that In the effort to produce the most effect
ive guns the margin of safety has been almost overstepped.
It is a serious condition of affairs that confronts the Navy
Department, the first inquiry of which must be to deter
mine whether faulty gun construction >or dangerous pow
der are responsible for this sweeping reduction of effi
ciency.
STRENGTHENING OF BRITAIN'S XAVY.
The British naval estimates for 1904-5 call for $184,
000,000 in round numbers, and exceed those of ten years
ago by 585,000,000. The personnel for 1894-5 was 83,400
and will now be 131,100. The amount voted for new
construction has increased from $22,600,000 to $58,270,000
during this period of ten years. A like increase has been
made in other navies, notably in that of the United
States. In 1894-5 the total appropriation was only $25,
360,000; now not less than $96,000,000 is likely to be al
lowed, showing an increase of about $71,000,000. The
personnel in our navy has increased from 11,300 to 38,000,
and new construction has been raised from $10,100,000
to nearly $32,000,000.
A river gunboat named the Vaterland has been built
at Elblng for service in the German colony in China. The
boat Is 164 feet 5 Inches in length, 26 feet 3 inches beam
and displaces 200 tons. It Is fitted with twin screw en
gines of 1400 horsepower, which on trial gave a speed of
13.5 knots. The Vaterland has a light armor protection
and carries a battery of one three and a half-pounder,
one one-pounder and throe machine guns, and its com
plement is fifty-three officers and crew.
The latest Spanish naval reconstruction bill provides
for four dl3tlnct departments at the Admiralty â a central
naval staff, a department of naval construction, a naval
supply department and a general department of naviga
tion, fisheries and naval industries. A sum of about
$9,000,000 is to be expended upon dockyards and ships, of
which Ferrol is' to have $2,500,000; Cartegena, $420,000, to
fit it for a torpedo station, and $1,222,000 is for improve
ment at Carraca. This would leave the modest sum of
$4,S5S,000 for new construction and armament.
The firms of GIo Ansaldo Company at Genoa and
Whitworth, Armstrong & Co., at Elswick. have combined
to build warships at Genoa. The new firm's capitaliza
tion Is $6,000,000. The company's statute9*jjrpvide for a
distribution of 5 per cent of the annual profits among the
men employed in the shipyard.
The frequent acridents of late to guns on our naval
vessels have prompted the Bureau of Ordnance to issue an
order reducing the smokeless powder charges for all guns
in the navy. It is virtually a confession by that bureau of
its lack of confidence in the guns and powder manufac
tured under its supervision, and the effect upon the per
sonnel, officers and crews, must be depressing. There is
nothinp more destructive to the efficiency of a fighting
ship than the suspicion that the guns are dangerous to
those who handle them, for with confidence shaken the
pun crews and all hands lose all spirit and may become
thoroughly demoralized. Our navy had a disastrous ex
perience of this kind in the Civil War, when, during the
second attack on Fort Fisher, bursting guns and prema
ture explosions on our ships killed and wounded more
men than the enemy's fire. The gun accidents during
the past three years have fortunately been without loss
of life, but the blowing off of the muzzles of two eight
inch guns/on the Iowa while at target practice m<ght
have been highly disastrous to ship and crew if occurring
during a battle at sea. It has been repoVted that the
beard of inquiry discovered that the forgings for the
burned guns had at one time been condemned, and irn
investigation is going on to ascertain the responsibility
for this act of treason, and whether It was premeditated
or due to a blunder. There may be other guns of that
kind on board ships; defective shells, causing premature
explosions, have been in evidence, but the chief trouble
seems to be with the smokeless powder. Our navy ex
perimented with this powder for many years, but not
until the Spanish-American war was it introduced in the
navy, nearly ten years after it had been used in the prin 1 
clpal European navies. It is conceded by all naval
authorities that this new powder is more destructive to
puns than the brown or common powder, but its use
abroad has not been attended with such serious results
as In our navy.
at an average speed of 1 4.3 knots, thus beating the Kear

Â¦jioariy of the same rise, the Kearsarge having- a displace
ment, fully loaded, of 12.yO5 tons, and the Gaulois 11,667
tons. The maximum horsepower and trial speed of the

The battleship Kearsarge made two good runs last
yesr across the Atlantic, establishing, it was believed, h
new world's record. To England the distance run was
3^00 miles, which was made at an average speed of 12.62
knots an hour. Returning from Portsmouth, England, to

The French service journal, Arniee et Marine, good
naturedly criticizes the "yellow papers" in the United
States which declare that the American navy is the best
in the world. This practice, it is contended, Is reprehen
sible in that it gives the general public an erroneous
idea of the rt-lative merits of navies." The Armee et
Marine admits that United States war vessels are excel
lent, but it contends that other naval powers have also
good ships and instances the records made by the Kear
sarge and Gaulois. An important point in this connec
tion is this, that the French ship is two years older than
There is one interesting fact in connection with these
two ships not generally known. They were designed by
Sir Edward Reed, formerly chief constructor in the
British navy, and at present with the Whitworth & Arm
strong firm at Elswick. The long and successful career of
Sir Edward Reed as a naval architect has made his name
familiar throughout the world, and ships of his design
have at one time been found in nearly all navies during
:he past forty years. He was born in 1830 and after a
Fix years' apprenticeship as shipwright at Sheerness dock
yard passed through the naval school at Portsmouth and
then left Government service. In 1863 he was offered
rnd accepted the position of chief constructor in the
British navy and held that office until 1870, when he
resigned because the admiralty, contrary to his advice,
had Captain Cole build a ship which Reed contended was
unseaworthy. Two months after his resignation the ship,
'named the Captain, capsized, drowning its designer and
over 400 officers and members of the crew. In addition to
the designing and superintendence of building war ves
sels and steam yachts during succeeding years. Sir Ed
ward Keed has written the best books on theoretical and
practical ship-building, and when Philip Watts left the
Armstrong company in 1902 to become director of naval
construction in the royal navy. Sir Edward Reed took hi3
j.lace as naval architect at Elswick. Xow, at the age of
over three score and ten. he has succeeded in designing
two warships which are admitted to be the best com
promise of all essential Qualities, on a less displacement
by nearly SO per cent and reduced cost than other navy
builders have done.
FRENCH CRITICISM OF OUR NAVY.
The purchase by Great Britain of the two small
battleships from Chile has caused discussion among naval
officers and other naval experts on the Continent regard
ing thÂ© merits and faults of these two remarkable ships
ae compared with other somewhat similar vessels. The
London Engineering in a recent issue devoted no less than
twenty-five pages to this subject, and the critical com
parative data of the world's battleships and armored
cruisers are interesting and valuable because of their ac
curacy and the manner in which they are presented.
Experts are not agreed on what constitutes a typical
battleship. Size, armament, protection, speed and coal
capacity are factors in which compromises must be made,
but taking the Russell type, a battleship of 14,000 tons
and nineteen knots for a comparison, the designer of the
Chilean ships has succeeded in attaining on 11,800 tons
a. speed of over twenty knots with only a slight sacrifice
of protection, and still retaining a battery power equal to
that of the British designs.

There are among us some club
votr.en who are mnst excellent and con
prier.tious women, who attend to their
Â«*Â»mmittee work with fine regularity,
but alas' they have not been endowed
Â¦with the kind of gray matter that
.makes executive officers. So, ladies, if
you love your clubs and cherish them,
l<-.r,k well into yo-ur politics, and assure
yourself that your candidate can make
an i.t<?llisent impromtu talk if called
upon, that she can pacify the.belliger
er.ts by her tact and diplomacy (in the
uords of the ward politician, is a good
mixer). When you have lorgnetted her
thoroughly and gauged her worth, then
F<Â» ahead. And here's that the cleverest
woman wins! The chair is no place
for incompetents, however lovable.
Clubwomen, on the threshold of
your election see to it that friendship
âbeautiful outside of politic? and busi
neS t S â does not entrap you into being
false to your club. The first end upper
most thoughts should be "Is Mrs. A.
physically, mentally and socially
equipped to assume the presidency of
the club? Has Fhe a pleasing person
ality, a good clear-speaking voice, a
quick perception, a grasp of situation,
a knowledge of human nature and.
above all, control of self?" Herein
lies one of the fundamental elements of
all leaders cf organized bodies. Without
p..FÂ«s<>sf-ing solf-mastery there will be
no club government; without club gov
ernment there would soon be no club.
"The melancholy time has come, the
eaddest <->' the year" â for election is
nigh In all clubdom, and they who
bore, with unctuous pride, the emolu
ments of office must now prepare to
lay them down and obliterate their per
sonalities in the marses of common
place numbersâ and that's hard. Some
of the officers, bowerer, are rather
gladly welcoming their terms' ends, for
they have labored faithfully and well,
attended their committees with re
ligious regularity, steered straight the
little bark they captained, and kept the
club In a Irealthy nvA vigorous- con
dition by their strong personality and
tactfulness. Of such are Mrs. Henry
Payot. president of the Forum; Mrs.
G>orge Law Smith of the California.
Mrs. George Haight of the Laurel Hall,
Mrp. George Dennison of the Corona.
Mrs. James McCauiey of the Mills and
Mrs. Dunbar of the SoroMs. These
Â¦w^m*Â»n have *tÂ«?adi^d the fhstitutions
over which they preside by their owrx
personalityâ and therein I'.es the first
requisite for a desirable club president.
At this time of club campaigning
women should, before all other con
eidf-rations, look to the "good" of the
club. The club is not an entity of
itself, with an organism of its own â
it must depend upon its members to
furnish it with proper brain-force to
gruide it aright. N'ow, herein Is where
zr.B.ny good wotn^n make bad club
women. They have a friend, for in

are given on Tuesday mornings. at the

Mrs. Wilson's guests, are Miss Jean
Pedlar, Miss Alice May, Miss Jennie H.
The regular monthly meeting of the
Sempervirens Club was held on March
3. at 1616 Clay street, with a full attend
ance of members of the board. A meet

district vice presidents from the sev

Thursday in April, to discuss important
measures.

."Invited as her guests, a party of
Americans was chatting at 'one of the
little club tea tables one afternoon this
winter, and in answer to a query Frau
von Leyden said: 'The club was or
panized to bring .together socially
those whom class distinctions usually
separate. Class divisions are so
marked here, it was felt that misun
derstandings by business women as to
members of the leisure class would be
obviated, and, reciprocally, the social
butterfly would better comprehend the
difficulties of the worker should they
now and then come together in friendly
intercourse. Barriers are broken
down, prejudices' laid aside, as In
tasteful surroundings each meets the
other at home.'

The Association Pioneer j Women of
California held a lively meeting in Gol
den late Hall on Friday. Through the
energy of the president, Mrs. Mclntyre,
and the liberality of the ladies, the
building fund was increased to a very
respectable sum.
Matter? of interest were considered
and acted upon, the most important be
ing an amendment to article III of the
constitution, -which admits as mem
bers to the association, all pioneer wo
men and the female descendants of pio
neer women and pioneer men who were
residents of California prior to and in
cluding the 21st day of December, 1S53.
This association is probably the most
remarkable body of women in the
United States, as nearly all of the
members came to this western wilder
ness prior to '53,-There are among them
a few daughters of puch women, but
they fail to possess the Interest that
clusters around women themselves who
fcught their way. over the plains and
mountains or braved the seas to get to
the Land of Promise.
It Is remarkable that at this day,
after all their privations and hard
ships, they fix 'their pompadours, ad
just their bonnets and sally forth to
their club meetings with the chipper
ness of a debutante. Long may they
live and prosper.

The Alden Club members are hard
at work. raising money for the pur

woman.
In conclusion, the Minister of Finance
asked Herr Macco to put through a
law raising passenger rates, saying:
"If you will. do this, I will devote the
surplus derived therefrom to the re
duction o' freight tariffs."
A comparison of railroad tariffs was
hardly possible, insomuch as many
American railroads own their own coal
mines and other industrial enterprises.
Where American railroads are without
competition, their tariffs are much
higher than In Prussia; and. moreover,
rates In the United States show a ten
dency to rise steadily. It must be taken
into consideration, the Minister of Fi
nance continued, that the United States
has much greater distance to cover and
larger quantities of freight to transport
than has Prussia. American railroads
cost $60,000 a mile to build, while, owing
to the greater cost of land in Prussia,
a mile of road costs $98,000.
How were the present cheap tariffs
in the United States reached? asked the
Finance Minister. Through tariff wars,
he answered, the recklessness of which
Prussia has no conception of. It is bet
ter to have steady tariffs than to be
exposed to the whims of railroad man
agers. Fifty-four per cent of the Ameri
can railroads do not pay a penny in
dividends, and the average dividend of
all the roads Is less than 2 per cent.
Herr von Rheinbaben admitted that
American tariffs were cheaper, but' he
pointed out that the passenger rates
In the United States were double those
in Prussia.
"Nevertheless," he said, "if I could
choose, I would take the American
principle of cheap freights and more
expensive passenger rates." .1>:1
"Give us. cheap transportation, Mr.
Finance Minister," said Herr Macco,
"and we will guarantee cheap pro
duction."
In 'reply, Herr von Rheinbaben al
luded to a remark made by Herr Macco,
and said he also was desirous of main
taining good relations with "that rising
country." He saw one great drawback
in American economic life, he continued
ânamely, the operations of labor
unions, which, he said, exercised a
terrorism of the most dangerous char
acter. Their power must be checked
betimes.
Herr Macco is a Rhenish manufac
turer who, in 1S93, visited the United
States to study matters pertaining to
transportation and industry. He said
that the United States was ahead of
Germany in many ways and, no matter
what might be thought of American
tariffs, it was a fact that transporta
tion in the United States was cheaper
than in Prussia. -â¢Â» .
BERLIN. March 6.â In the course of
a discussion In the Prussian Diet,
which followed the introduction of a
resolution asking for a reduction in
railroad tariffs, the comparative cheap
ness of transports in Germany and the
United States was debated by Herr
Macco and Minister of Finance von
Rheinbaben.

To what extent authors, playwrights
and, above all. Journalists, are recruited
from a different class of society than
h?re in the United States, and how
ignorant they are as a class of the
usages among well-bred people, is
amusingly Fhown by the pious horror
and indignation which has been ex
tensively expressed in print at the "Im
pertinence" of Joseph Chamberlain in
ivritingr lo the Duke of Devonshire as
"My Dear Devonshire," in lieu of
giving him his title, in the recently
published correspondence between the
two statesmen in connection with the
affairs of the Liberal Unionist Associa
tion. No account seems to be taken of
the fact that the Duke and Mr.
Chamberlain are of about the same
age, and have been not merely close
poljtical allies but warm and intimate
personal friends for sixteen or twenty
*-ears past. It is therefore just as
natural that Chambeclain should drop
Jie title in addressing the Duke as that
:hÂ» latter should dispense with the
â¢1\t." in writing to the former Secre
tary of State for the colonies.âBalti

"V.'he-n I went into the trade," he
'.â¢>::T:r.ued. "that was in 1842, whalebone
cutting was a recognized part of the
corset and the umbrella trades. Man
ufHCtured whalebone was Is a pound
then, and when the price rose to Is 6d
a pound the umbrella makers cried out
that they would be ruined.
~Xow the price is 40s a pound. The
year after I entered the business I re
ir.f inber carrying a blade of whalebone
filter n,fect long to the British museum
as a present from my master.
"A preat many things were made of
K-faalebone in those days. Stays, of
Â« "urse, and umbrella and parasol ribs.
'Those old umbrellas were good ones to
n>ar, but they rolled up something like
a lettuce in appearance. We still make
artist*" sketching umbrellas and car
riage shades of w halebone, but they are
expensive.
"Then we used to use whalebone for
fastening to the underside of the shafts
of light gigs, to pive elasticity and
strength without weight. Brooms were
made of, whalebone, and how those old
brooms used to last! It was used for
chimney-sweeping machines; it was
also cut into hair for dandy brushes for
horses."
Later on whalebone was put into the
handles of the best cricket bats, though
us it is always put in edgewise the old
man failed to see how it can lend any
rxtra spring to the bat. As a matter
of fact, now that whalebone Is so dear,
black wood is being put in to look like
it. "And I have no doubt it does Just
as well," said the old man, with a
chuckle.
The veteran can remember the time
uhon eight vans, each carrying four
tons of bone, used to be seen standing
:Â»utside the shop twice a month, after
hi*, master had been down to the docks
to buy. Fancy what that would mean
at Â£3000 a ton: â London Express.
The Decay of an Old British and
American Industry and Its Pa
ihetie Aspect.
The sensational pale of a whalebone
at Dundee at the record price of Â£3000
a ton was no doubt quite gratifying to
the vendor, but there was a pathetic
aspect to it of which a few people had
any definite conception. Whalebone
at Â£3000 a ton sounds another note â
nearly the la?t â In the long-drawn
knoll of ihe whalebone cutter.
There was a time when whalebone
rutting was a flourishing industry in
this country, employing a great num
ber of men. The day is approaching
when the whalebone cutter will be
nearly as hard to find as the dodo.
"You want to know about whale
bone." said an old cutter, one of the
very few remaining in London, to an
Express representative. "Well, I know
all about whalebone; at least, I ought
to. seeing: that I came into the trade
when I was 14 years old, and I was 76
yesterday. My father was a whalebone
cutter, and my father's stepfather was
a whalebone cutter before him. My
brother was a whalebone cutter, and
my son understands whalebone cut
ting, though there is not enough of
ihe trade left to make it worth his
while to follow it."

"One of the grandest enterprises I
ever heard of any organization," Sen
ator Dolliver said, "was the offer of this
society to make a language for a bar
barous people whose speech had not
even attained to the dignity of an al
phabet. The society undertook to first
make an alphabet, then a translation
of the Bible and finally a literature.
Certainly the brain of man never con
ceived a grander philanthropic pur
pose." \
Justice Brewer declared that the
greatest glory of this nation lies in the
fact that ever and always she has
striven to translate into the vernacular
of international law the parable of the
Good Samaritan and the golden rule.
Senator Dolliver said that the Bible
Society had contributed more than any
other influence the creeds of Christen
dom into one grand whole, representing
universal Christianity.
WASHINGTON, March 6.â President
8nd Mrs. Roosevelt, Justice Brewer of
the Supreme Court, Senator Dolliver of
Iowa, the British Embassador and
Lady Durand and many other persons
prominent In official, diplomatic and
social circles attended the service to
day In commemoration of the one hun
dredth anniversary of the British and
Foreign Bible Society at St. John's
Episcopal Church. Justice Brewer and
Senator Dolliver were the principal
speakers. Dr. Daniel C. Gllman, presi
dent of the American Bible Society,
presided and made a few remarks, in
which he said that during the lifetime
of the British and American societies
they had circulated 250,000,000 copies of
the Bible and parts of the Bible to the
nations of the world.
Justice Brewer said: "It is scarcely
necessary before this audience to enter
upon a eulogy or defense of the great
book of books. But this is the age of
the/iconoclast, when destructive critH
cism runs rampant. Some criticism,
indeed, is reverent and usefulâ that
which seeks simply by correcting wrong
translations and arranging in chrono
logical order the matchless truths of
the Scripture.
"But there are other critics, without
such lofty aim, whfc strive to destroy
the faith of other men simply because
It Is held. The iconoclast is a popular
man to-day. To him the Bible appears
merely as a sort of crazy-qullt of un
true history, distorted science, weak
poetry, impractical morality and vague
foreshadowltigs of the unknown and
unknowable. 1 Yet we who believe know
there are passages in the Bible unsur
passed in solemn beauty in the litera
ture of the world; that its ideals of
morality are those to which the best
within us Is always aspiring; that Its
promises are the sweetest and most
comforting that have ever come to the
tired hearts of man."
The ship Olivebank went to the Ris
don Iron Works yesterday for extensive
repare. She arrived here on December
23 after having passed through a terri
ble experience of storms and gales
which almost completely dismantled
her, and how Captain Henderson ever
got her into port In her wrecked con
dition was a mystery to every one that
looked at her. She was bound from
Shanghai to Puget Sound, but had to
put in here. On arrival she was sent
into quarantine, where she was thor
oughly fumigated.
When she was released underwriters
and others in interest commenced to
work on the subject of settling up the
losses, and finally last week they were
practically adjusted. It will take about
$40,000 to put her In seagoing shape,,
and it will be some weeks before she
can be placed in commission again.

ST. PETERSBURG, March 6.âAn
swering an inquiry concerning the
fate of Baron Toll, the explorer who
was recently reported to have per
ished in the Arctic Ocean, M. Dou
brovit, secretary of the Academy of
Sciences, says that he has not re
ceived a word of news for some time.
Another expedition is now searching
for him.^ The belief now is that the
Barbn has been lost.
The Bourse Gazette offers a reward
for Information establishing the ex
plorer's death.
Nothing has been heard from Baron
Toll since he left the yacht Zaria.
May 23, 1902, in company with two
Yakuts and started for Bennett Is
land. The Zarla left her winter
quarters early in June, 1902, to find
Baron Toll and his associate. Zo
ologist Biriliu, but was unsuccessful
in its mission and returned to the
Lena River. Biriliu escaped across
the ice. Three relief parties were
sent out by the Academy early in
19Q3, one of them being under the
command of Lieutenant Kolchak.
A dispatch from Yalluts, Eastern
Siberia, dated January 15 last, said
that boatsmen of the expedition
commanded by Lieutenant Kolchak
had arrived there and reported that
the effort of the expedition to find
Baron Toll had been unsuccessful.
Baron Toll left documents on Bennett
Island showing that he had turned
southward November 8, 1902.

His ability as a scientist was soon
recognized and for years he was con
nected with many of the larger and
more Important schools and colleges
In the East. He came to San Francisco
many years ago and during his long
sojourn in this city contributed much
to the cause of science and literature.
For more than a decade Dr. Behr
had been connected with the Academy
of Sciences in this city, occupying the
important position of second vice pres
ident and curator of that institution.
He was a prominent member of the
Bohemian Club and gt the time of his
death was engaged in writing a book
for that institution.
Dr. Behr was the author of several
scientific works, all of which were
highly regarded by educational insti
tutions in every part of the country.
The direct cause of Dr. Behr's death
was heart failure, a malady from which
he had suffered for many years. He
appeared to be in fairly good health on
Saturday night, but began to fail early
yesterday morning. Dr. George Chis
more, an old time friend, was summon
ed atod the aged scientist succumbed
shortly after the arrival of the phy
sician.
The funeral services will be held to
morrow morning from the undertaking
establishment of Gantner Bros, on Mis
sion street. The remains will be taken
to St. Boniface's Church, where a sol
emn requiem mass will be said for the
repose of the soul of the deceased. In
terment will be made at Holy Cross
Cemetery.
Dr. Herman H. Behr, a scientist
whose name was famous in two conti
nents, passed peacefully away at his
residence on Bush street yesterday
morning, shortly after 10 o'clock. By
his death California loses a scholar
whose work and efforts gave him
standing with the learned men of the
present generation and whose place can
never be filled.
Dr. Behr was a resident of this city
for many years and though of late he
had led a secluded life, yet his achieve
ments will never die. He was born in
Germany eighty-five years ago, and
after gaining fame In his native land
set sail for America with the hope of
achieving more triumphs.

Kin? Edward a Iilccnsed Barrister.
An exception has been taken to my
statement in these columns recently to
the effect that King Edward was a full-
fledged member of the English bar and
the only reigning sovereign to be enti-
tled to practice in ccurts as a lawyer.
J would reiterate ray assertion, con-
flrming.it by means of a letter which I
have received from Henry Tudor of St.
Louis, who was called to the bar in
England about the^same time and who
reminds me that Sir George Lewis of
the well-known London firm of solicit-
ors (lawyers) Lewis & Lewis, so famous
as criminal attorneys, sent shortly aft-
erward to the then Prince of Wales his
first and only brief in some case of
petty larceny, accompanied by the
usual fee of one guinea for himself and
a half-crown (about 60 cents) for his
clerk. While the King did not appear
in court in the case in question, and no
other attorney to my knowledge ever
ventured to follow the example of Sir
George Lewis in conftding a case to
Edward VII, the latter cannot under
the circumstances be described as an
altogether briefless barrister.â Balti-

He expects to mount the horse at once,

finding that the flrst lesson consists

The First Hiding Lesson.
What makes this the more strange is
that it is entirely peculiar to the Brit
ish army. In every foreign country
soldiers â and officers most of allâ seem
to be extremely proud of their uni
forms, and lose no opportunity of diR
playing themselves therein. The effect
of smart military uniforms in brighten
ing up a crowd, whether out of doors
or at any evening assemblage, Is un
deniable. As a mere matter of esthet
ics most people will agree that it would
be a decided improvement if uniforms
were worn Jn England as' they are on
the continent. Arid from the merely
professional pointof view I cannot help
thinking that It would tfe of advantage
to. the army if soldiers of all ranks
were expected to take a little more
pride in the King's livery, and not en
couraged so much as they now arc to
consider it a privilegeto appear as civ
ilians. â London Truth."
But, for some inscrutable reason, our
soldiers appear to think their uniform
is a badge of shame, or at least of ser
vitude. Any self-respecting officer, so
far as I can see. would rather die at
the head of a forlorn hope than go to
a theater or restaurant or a private
ball in full regimentals. A non-com
missioned officer who sees a brother
warrior privileged to walk down the
street in plain clothes turns sick with
envy. >Â» T o soldier of any rank seems to
consider that uniform can enhance his
attractions to the female eye, and the
only way in which I have ever heard
of its being used for this purpose is by
the humble, but impecunious, private,
who charges a female admirer so much
an hourâ 2 pence is, I believe, the usual
fee â for walking out in company with
him. â¢;â¢' Â¦-:<

Charles Kurlin, the rapidly improving
third cl#s man, took a fall out "of
Chester a second class man.
Kurlin did not do well in the flrst ?et,
retting but one game, but in the next
two his clever chop stroke was too
much for Smith. Kuohn used his usual
good head work and his net work was
accurate. The score was 1-6, 6-2, 6-4.
Cornell showed to better advantage
in singles. He played a one-set match
with his partner, Splivalo. The Belmont
champion was rather tired and lost by
a small margin. The score in Cornell's
favor was 6-4.
By far the closest and most exciting
match was that between Robert Drolla
and Harold Gabriel, the assistant court
keepers. There is considerable rivalry
between the two and the question of
supremacy is one that both have been
anxious to settle. Drolla proved his
superiority In a three-set match yes
terday. He won the first set 6-2. Ga
briel played all around him in the sec
ond, which he won by a 6-1 score. The
third and deciding set went up to 10-8
with Gabriel on the' short end. The
winner had nothing to spare and It is
doubtful If he would have won had the
match gone five sets.

The former played together for the first

well. The score was 3-6, 6-3, 6-4.

The movement deserves hearty sup
port and thoroughgoing success. Drug
gists and physicians generally are in
favor of it, for they know better thau
any other persons, except the victims
themselves, the ravages which these
drugs can cause. There are black sheep
druggists"' who are willing to ruin the
bodies and souls of all their customers
for a few pennies of profit. They de
serve no sympathy from any one, anÂ«l
the more rigorously they are prosecuted
and the more severely they are pun
ished the better it will be for the com

At the last session of the IUinoi3
General Assembly a law was passed
prohibiting the sale of cocaine in any
form, except on physician*^ prescrip
tion, and the State Board of Pharmacy
is now engaged in putting it into effect
At about the same time Georgia, Penn
sylvania and Texas also passed anti
cocaine or anti-narcotic j laws, and
twelve or fifteen of the States all told
have now placed such legislation on
their statute books. The campaign
against these drugs has been taken up
with very great vigor by the American
Pharmaceutical Association and will be
waged on a national scale. A stringent
law has been drafted, which has al
ready been Introduced into CongTess
as part of the general poison bill by
Representative Robinson of Indiana.
Substantially the same law will be pre
sented for the consideration of every
State Legislature that meets this win
ter. The campaign is to be continued
until by both State and national legis
lation the entire country Is protected
as fully as legislation can protect it
against cocaine, morphine and all their

Sixty or seventy years ago. when
steam navigation was In Its infancy,
piracy played a much more serious
role in maritime intercourse with the
Far East than to-day. In fact, every
vessel that had occasion to traverse
the Straits of Malacca or to skirt the
coast line of the Malay Peninsula and
of China was compelled to carry guns
to repel those fierce pirates which
were the sourge of the seas. Lady
Burdett-Coutts was so horxifled by the
stories wh'ch reached England cf
great ocean clippers being seized by
the pirates and with all the men on
board massacred and the women and
children carried off into a slavery
worse than death that she employed
some of her colossal wealth In organiz
ing and equipping a large armed naval
expedition for the purpose of exter
minating these pests, placing it under
command of Captain Harry Keppel of
the royal navay and Comander James
Brooke of the same service, who ob
tained an indefinite leave of absence
from the Admiralty in order to take
charge of her enterprise. They did
their work well, and pursuing tha
pirates into their lairs practically
cleared the seas of them. â Baltimora

There was another big crowd at the
Olympic Club yesterday afternoon to
see James Fitzgerald, the world's
champion handball player, contest
against Al Hampton and Henry Corey,
two crack amateurs of the coast. The
latter won from the champion by a
series of lucky plays. They made Fitz
run all over the court, and, although
tired, he played them to a standstill.
Fitz is gradually getting into condition
for his match game with Mike Egan,
which will be held at the Olympic Club
on the 2Sth Inst. Seats will cost $5
each, owing to the limited accommo
dations for spectators. â¢

Comparisons, or contrasts, between
Japan and Russia are striking in more
.than one respect. Thus, Japan has
about .47,000,000 people and Russia per
haps 130,000,000. Again, Japan's land
area is scarcely 163,000 square miles,
while Russia's is nearly 8,700,000. So
Russia has nearly three times as many
people and more than fifty times as
much land as Japan. (Wherefore, we
might think, Russia might well afford
to be a little less land hungry at Ja
pan's expense.) On the other hand,
Japan, with her smaller population, has
more pupils in her schools than Russia*
According to the latest available statis
tics, Japan has 4,302,623 children in ele
mentary schools and Russia only 4,193,
594. That is to say, ninety-rone In every
thousand Japanese and only thirty-two
in every thousand Russians are in ele
mentary schools. The disproportion of
numbers in secondary schools and uni
versities is equally marked In favor of
Japan.
Again, Japan has 4832 postofnees, or
one for every 9700 people, while Russia
has only 6029, or one to every 21,500
people. Japan has, under sail and
steam, a commercial marine of 734,413
tons, while Russia has only 633,822 tons.
Japan's purchases from the United
States amount to about $21,000,000 a
year, and Russia's to only $17,000,000.
Of course, it is argued that Russia is
still in an elementary stage of develop
ment. But Russia has been In full and
direct intercourse with the civilized
world since the time of Peter the Great,
200 years ago, while Japan has been in
a similar state scarcely fifty years.
That is to say, Japan has made three
times the progress Russia has, and in
one-fourth the time. In such circum
stances, it is not at all strange that
the admiration and sympathy of the
world are given to Japan in a great
measure. â New York Tribune.

The Thistles beat the Oakland Hor
nets S goals to 0 in a match for the
championship of the California Asso
ciation Football League and the Inde
pendents defeated the Vampires 4 goals
to D in the tie for the California Asso
ciation Football Union cup yesterday.
Both games were played on the Pre
sidio Athletic Grounds in this city. The
ground was covered with soft, slippery
mud and ptrols of water stood in many
places. The players found it hard to
keep their feet and were bespattered
with mud from head to foot.
The ball In the Thistle-Hornet match
was kicked off at 1:40 p. m., A. W.
Wilding being the referee and the lines
men being Irish and Sheldon. In the
first half the Thistles defended the
south goal and the Hornets the north.
During the first period the Hornets,
with only eight men in the field, fell
easy victims to the superior team work
and numbers of the Thistle eleven,
whose forwards played as they liked
with the ball, passing it fr,om one to
the other with the greatest ease. The
Thistles put the ball between the posts
five times in the first half. In the sec
ond period ends were changed and Mc-
Kenzie strengthened the forward line of
the Hornets, Thistles added three
more goals, making their total score
eight goals. Shand. McKenzie and
Pomeroy worked hard for the Hornets,
but were quite outmatched. William
son kept several hot shots from going
between the posts, but they were alto
gether too numerous for one man to
save them all. The teams occupied the
following positions:

At 3:30 p. m. the Independents and
Vampires went out on the field for the
match in the first round for the cup.
The Independents proved too strong for
the Vampires, who defended the south
goal. In the flrst few minutes T. Fay
kicked a goal for the Independents, to
which E. Fay and Duncanson added
a goal apiece before the end of the first
period. Arthur Robinson was the ref
eree, C. W. Irish and A. E. J. Chivers
being the linesmen. In the second per
iod McCallum left the forward line and
played in the half back line, Harwcrod
mc-ving up to the left wing. Toward
the end of the second period McCallum
took Petersen's position in the full back
line, Petersen taking a place in the for
ward line. On two or three occasions
the Vampires went near scoring, but
were nc-t quite able to do the trlok.
The Independents peppered the Vam
pires* goal, but Rolfe did excellent
work and kept all the shots out until
in the last ten seconds before the
whistle sounded one got past him, mak
ing the winners' score 4 goals to 0.
The teams lined up in the following
order:

The Warwickshire polo team defeat
ed the Burlingarae Club men for a
silver cup on the club's field yesterday
afternoon by the narrow margin of 6
goals to 5. The game was stubbornly
contested and it seemed likely that a
few more minutes of play would have
enabled the home team to tie the score.
The beautiful afternoon and the im
portance of the match drew out the
largest gallery of the season, and in
addition to a crowded grandstand the
entire front of the large field was,
lined with vehicles. The spectators
Including all of the fashionable set.
The contest might properly be termed
an international match, as the op
posing teams were all English and all
American respectively. The Warwick
shire team, wearing the white colors,
was composed of Basil Williams,
Charles Garland. F. J. Mackey and
Captain Xeil Haig. The Burlingame
gentlemen, in red, were F. J. Carolan,
R. M. Tobin, John Lawson and Walter
McCreery.
Notwithstanding that the field was
heavy and soft the game was played
with the utmost dash and abandon
and the heavy breathing of the ponies
indicated the hard task they were
performing. John Lawson In his
strokes to-day was not inferior to the
powerful Englishman. Captain Haig.
and made two remarkably fine goal
shots, which won rounds of applause.
As to th* 1 big Englishman, if he fights
the King's battles jip well as he plays
polo, he isÂ» an invaluable soldier of the
empire and may yet exchange his polo
mallet for a marshal's baton.
Britt spent but a short time on the
road yesterday morning. In the even
ing he came across the bay and attend
ed the theater with a party of friends.
Among the features at the contest to
morrow night, at Oakland, between
Billy "Woods, the coast middle-weight
champion boxer, and Cyclone Kally

Invented by "Biddy" Bishop and which
will be used In "Woods* corner. When
the colored boxar retires to his corner,
tired and worn from the effects of a
hard round, the spray will be called
into play. By the aid of this pump a
big spray of Ice-cold watery rnist will
hit the tired boxer Just as he starts for
his corner at the conclusion of the
round, and it will fall over him like a
dense cloud. The cold spray coming in
contact with his heated body and head
is expected to brighten him and send
him in for the next round In a refreshed
condition. The colored man *ays he
will have this patented, to prevent
other boxers from using.
Another feature will be the presence
of Jimmy Britt. In Fred Landers* cor

Spotless Beauty, one of the coursers
of J. J. Lavin's St. Louis kennel, took
first honors yesterday In the big open
stake at Ingleslde Coursing Park.
The Beauty showed in great form,
and it was no trouble for her to get
the flag from her opponents. Each
trial was of short order, and in the
final she romped away from Jerry
O'Shea's Young Fearless.
Quite a number of short ends were
recorded. The hardest upset of the
day was the defeat of Firm Fellow, a
1 to 5 shot, by Terra Cotta. The victor
in the next round took honors, from
Lily York and afterward succumbed
to the runner up. Black Coon was
really the slated winner, but fell a
victim to coursing luck. Hard running
was his lot. In the fifth round he beat
Little Mercy in a go that lasted nearly
three minutes. In the next round his
trainer was forced to withdraw him.

during the day, and as the soft light
in the afternoon came on succeeded in
making the excellent score of 95 rlng3
out of a possible 100. F. P. Schu&ter
also made S5 rings, but as Pape had
another score of 94 to back up his 95
he was awarded first honors. D. B.

The day's scores follow:
The twenty-fifth anniversary of &e
opening of Shell Mound Park yester
day was a pronounced success In
every way. Both pavilions were
crowded by those who took delight in
dancing and merrymaking, while the
shooting stand was crowded to its ca
pacity. The light wind and damp at
mosphere made it an ideal' day for
target shooting.
The young greyhound Bill Dugan,
the coal black son of imported Warbur
ton, surprised the wise bettors yester
day at Union Coursing 1 Park. After an
undecided course with Tillie R, in
which each scored six points, he came
back and defeated her for the long end
of the purse by a score of eight points
to seven.
Tillie R was installed a 1 to 2% choice
for the first trial. The betting went
quickly to 1 to 6 when the dogs were
sent back to slips. In the first trial
the hare broke to Bill Dugan and it
was this favor which helped him make
it a tie. In the runoff he showed speed
over his opponent. Had she run with
any determination she would have wtrn.
She was fortunate in having short
trials throughout the day.
The winner opened in the long odds
betting at 100 to 1. This price was cut
to 60 in the third round of the stake
and then to 5.
Champion Pocatelli was unfortunate
in having two severe trials which ne
cessitated his .being withdrawn -in the
semi-final round. The attendance was
large and the sport of high class. The
day's results in detail, with Judge P. J.

A most extraordinary proposal has
recently had the favorable consider
ation of the Prussian Minister of Fin
ance. . The originator is Herr Scherl,
the proprietor and publisher of the
Berlin Lokal Anzeiger. The plan com
bines a workingmen's savings bank
with an elaborate national lottery.
The new institution would collect from
the working: classes weekly savings
ranging from 50 pfennige (12 cents)
to four marks (Si').- These savings
would be entrusted to such existing
savings banks as were willing to adopt
,the new system and to pay for fifty
two weeks' deposits of four marks â â¢
that is to say, for 208 marks â an in
terest of 1-80 mark at the close of the
year, with corresponding fixed rates
cf interest for smaller deposits. This
Interest, however, would not go to the
depositors, but would be paid Into a
lottery fund/ the administration of
which:. would hand to the depositors
lottery -tickets of corresponding value.
Three, hundred thousand of these
tickets divisible Into Quarters and
eighths, according to the amounts of
the deposits, wonld form a lottery
aeries from, which 12,500 prizes would
be drawn, with a total of 540.000
marks. The value of the first prize
would be, 100,000 marks, of the second
prize 30,000 marks, of the third, prize
10,000 marks and so on, winding up
with 8420. prizes each of the value | of
20* marks. -The scheme has been sub
jected to very seyere criticism.â Xew

tion of San Francisco, acted as.secre
tary. Representatives of the various
retail trade organizations of San
Francisco were present and it was
unanimously resolved that a â¢ com
munication opposing the proposed
free flower market ordinance be for
warded to the Board of Supervisors.
The communication saysiin part:
.The Retailers' Federation of .California, an
association comprising the various retail
trade organizations cf this' city and State, de
sires to record its protest against the passage
by your honorable body of the proposed ordi
nance for establishing; free flower markets - at
various street crossings and othar localities in
this city, and to set forth Its reasons for such
protest.
. We believe .that the passage I of this ordi
nance will be the tstabllshment of an ;un
wholesome precedent, and one that is subversive
of the settled policy of the board, as evidenced
by its recent legislation In conformity with the
provision* of the charter," and by the enforce
ment of v that policy on the part of our Board
of Public Works. _\ >â¢
The proDosed free flower market ordinance is
aimed" directly at- the retail i florists -of ,this
city, whose organization is a respectable 'and'
influential member of this ; .- federation, . and,
while in consonance with our object of mutual
protection, we oppose the ordinance because of
its effect upon them," we also respectfully urge
that the passage of this ordinance will: have
the effect of bestirrlng.agitation in other di
rections . which will . end In no good. " There is
no good reason; why -peddlers of flowers should
be granted the special and Valuable privileges
contemplated by this ordinance and why those
privileges should be denied- to peddlta* dealers

"Robert Burns, of the Temptations
and Triumphs of Poverty," was the
subject of a sermon delivered before
an immense assemblage of worship
ers at the Third Congregational
Church, Fifteenth and Mission streets,
last night.
In the course of his remarks the
Rev. Mr. Rader said:
Poverty, like affluence, colors a man's envi
ronment and helps to form his ideas. Our eco
nomic convictions come from our pockets; the
man with, a full pocket has a different idea
of life to the man whose pocket is empty.
Millionaires are never social reformers.
And in this comparison we may trace certain
ideas of Robert Burns directly to his poverty.
The first was his Â¦ democracy. He believed in
the common people. To the French convention
during the revolution he sent a little cannon,
and, asked to give a toast to William Pitt, he
said: "America's independence, England's ter
ror. I drink to the name of George "Washing
ton."
To his environment may be traced his rever
ence to the commonplace. He found poetry in
the daisy, in the field mouse. In the humble
cottage and in labor.
Poetry is the insight into the common things
in life; it is truth filtered through the Imagina
tion.. ....
Burns was a liberal thinker and I am sorry
to say that he lived liberally. It would have
been better if he had had more Calvinism in
his character. There was too much of the
flower and not enough of the cak in his charac
ter. Presbyterians of this date aÂ«ree .with
Burns rather than with John Knox in certain
phases of Calvlnistlc thought.
There can be no doubt that the character of
the poet was largely the result of his early
training and surroundings.
He dissipated and is said to have died of
debauchery. The tragedy of his life is In the
fact that the candle burned to Its socket be
fore middle life. But God does not expect a
man to die at the age of 30.
In making a comparison between Lord Ten
nyson and Whlttler and Burns, we find that
Tennyson was an aristocrat, who dipped hiÂ»
pen far back Into history and clothed his
characters with royalty. wljile Burns simply
talked about the people of his own town. W'hit
tler. who Â¦ is sometimes called the American
Burns might be compared to the Scottish poet
as a glow worm to a ccal of fire.

James Connelly Holds Up E. P. Sim
mons in Doorway on 'Kearny
. Street and Is Arrested.
James Connelly, a "hobo," ap
proached E. P. Simmons, a printer, on
Kearny street, near Pine, yesterday
afternoon^ about 3 o'clock and asked
him for some money. Simmons was
considerably under the influence of
liquor. He handed Connelly some* beer
checks and Connelly grabbed him by
the throat and shoved him into a door
way and demanded money. Several
people gathered in front of the door
way, which attracted the attention of
Policemen Keohane and O'Connor.
When the officers reached the door
way Connelly had hold of Simmons
and was telling him to "give up." Sim
mons complained that Connelly was
holding him up and when Connelly was
questioned by the officers he could not
give them a satisfactory explanation.
He was taken to the City Prison and
booked on a charge of robbery and
Simmons was booked for being, drunk.
Connelly said he was a stranger here,
having only arrived three weeks ago.
Brutal Blow.
George McLaughlin ; Fells William
Chamberlain to the Earth With a
George â¢ McLaughlln hit William
Chamberlain on the head with an ax
and has left a mark that will take
many moons to efface. Though the.oc
currence in itself is serious enough, the
events that led up to it are of . a
humorous character.
McLaughlin, who hails from the
Emerald Isle, says he does not know
how old he is, but states with empha
sis that he was born on the same day
and date as Queen Victoria,- . which
would make him 85 years of age on the
coming May 24. He certainly looks it.
He is small, wizened, and has parted
with all his teeth, but he has not part
ed with his vigor nor the passion of
love that filled his breast in early
youth.
From what is reported on the water
front, McLaughlin lives in Baldwin
court, and Chamberlain, who is 65
years old, lives near by. Shortly after
noon yesterday Chamberlain tapped on
McLaughlin's door to pay a friendly
call, but instead of welcoming, him
McLaughlin grabbed an ax and smote
him on the head, leaving a wide cut
over his left ear.
The cause is stated to be a woman,
named Mrs. Nicholls, over whose head
some seventy-two summers lightly
rolled, and to whom the .belligerents
have been paying attention." Cham
berlain had his head sewed up at the
Harbor Emergency Hospital and later
was sant home. McLaughlin was
carted down to the Hall of Justice'.- He
will have a hearing to-day.

Chief Jpiler Sullivan Ridicule! Story
of an Attempt to Escape From
the County Jail.
The most surprised man in the city
yesterday was J. ' E. Sullivan, Chief
Jailer at the County Jail on Broadway,
when he read in one of the morning
papers the sensational account of a'n
alleged attempt made by Eddie Yarrow
and two other criminals to break out
of jail. He did not deny that they, had
succeeded in loosening two or three
bricks from the wall with the ajd of
the handle of a bucket, but he believed
it had been done more as a joke than
anything else.
"Why," -Sullivan said, "it would have
taken them 100 years.to break through
the wall with the handle of the bucket.
It is true that my attention was called
to the fact that something was doing
in the cell occupied by the three pris
oners about ten days ago and I dis
covered the small hole in the wall
made by the absent bricks, but the
other part of the sensational story is
all imagination, except, of course, the
records of the prisoners. I thought so
little of the incident that I did not
think it worth while to mention it. /It
is too ridiculous to be seriously consid
ered."

BREAK THROUGH WALL

An important meeting of the execu
tive committee will be held In Knights
of the Red Branch Hall Wednesday
evening. .
Morgan Seal, a bell boy in_ the
Langham Hotel, Ellis . and Mason
streets, committed a vicious assault
upon F. G. Francis, acting clerk, early
yesterday -morning and, after he had
beaten his victim into insensibility,
rifled the office register. Then he
made his escape. The robbery was
planned with criminal ingenuity. Seal
lured the clerk into a room and after
causing him to turn his head by point
ing to something, struck him on the
head with a club. Francis did not
drop immediately, but staggered into
the hallway. Another attack was
made up^on him there, and when he
fell his fallow employe proceeded to
rib the till of $45 in coin.
Seal is an ex-marine and had been
in the service of the hotel but one
week. He came without a recommen
dation, but his appearance was in his
favor and he was given a position.
Shortly before 7 o'clock yesterday
morning Seal and Francis were on
duty, the former running the elevator
and the latter 'attending to the of
fice. The elevator bell rang and Seal
descended to the street entrance,
after which he took a gue^t up to
his room, on an upper floor. When
Seal came to the office floor he called
to Francis to come quickly, to the
parlor, as he wished to show him
something. Francis did as directed
and followed along the hallway until
this particular room was reached.
When the two entered the parlor.
Seal called to Francis to examine a
corner in the room. . The clerk bent
over to do so and at the same time
received a stinging blow on the back
of the head from a club in the hands
of Seal. He recovered himself quick
ly and started back into the hall
way. Again Seal wielded the club
and the clerk dropped. Then the
bellboy hurried back to the office
and pocketed the contents of the
till. V
As soon as Francis recovered, he
staggered down the 1 stairway leading
to the street and cried loudly for
help. A policeman responded to his
call and a search was commenced.
This, however, was useless, as the
thief had made his escape by means
of a back entrance and had reached
another street through an alleyway.
The detective department was noti
fied and Captain Martin put two .men
on the trail of the thug. Up to a
late hour last night no arrest had
been made.
Ihe police are puzzled to know
whether Mrs. A. Weiser, who is 84
years of ase, has been robbed of her
hand satchel containing 5450 in cur
rency, her railroad ticket and baggage
checks, or has lost it on train or street
car.
The old lady lives in Milwaukee,
where she has property, and she went
from there to Los Angeles for the ben
efit of her health. She has a son, Al
bert Weiser, in Denver, and she ar
rived at the Third and Townsend
street depot on Saturday night from
Los Angeles on her way to visit him.
Yesterday morning Mrs. Weiser en
tered a -pawn shop on Kearny street'
and offered to pawn her gold watch
and chain. The pawnbroker asked her
a few questions and her replies caused
him to take her to police headquarters.
She told Captain Martin about the loss
of her satchel, which she thought had
been taken from her while she was on
the train. After arriving here she
boarded a street car. which stopped aÂ»
some hotel, and she registered at the
hotel and paid $1 for a room.
It was then she discovered that she
did not have her satchel, but she for
tunately had a small purse containing
$1 22 in a pocket in her dress. Yes
terday morning she found that she
would have to pay 50 cents for her
breakfast and that was why she want
ed to pawn her watch and chain to get
some money. She said she had wired
to her son in Denver and had told him
to send a reply to the ferry building.
She said she had no idea where she
had left two valises that she brought
with her and it was later discovered
that she had taken the valises from
the depot at Third and Townsend
streets and had gone with them to the
ferry building, where she had left them
on a bench.
x Chief Wittman was notified of the
old lady's predicament and he gave her
enough money to supply her immediate
wants and sent Detective Taylor with
her in a hack to the ferry to recover
her valises. He also instructed Taylor
to take her to the New Western Hotel
till he could communicate with her son
in Denver. The chief sent a dispatch
to Chief Armstrong of Denver to find
Albert Weiser and notify him of his
mother's plight.
Mrs. Weiser said she did not remem
ber the hotel where she had stopped
on Saturday night and Detective Tay
lor will endeavor to locate lt to-day.
Mrs. Weiser told him that she thought
a woman who sat beside her on the
street car had taken her satchel, but
she told the chief that she thought it
had been taken from her on the train.
She did not care for the loss of the
money, as she was wealthy, she said,
but she did not like to bs left in a
strange city with only 22 cents. â¢
