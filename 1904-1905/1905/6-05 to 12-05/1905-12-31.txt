fT^HEX, striking a pose that was al
j most tragic, Mrs. Hanway-Harley
I told Dorothy she must marry
J Etorri.
"As your mother I command It!"
eald Mrs. Hanway-Harley, lifting her
Jeweled hand finely, as though the thing
were settled and the conference at an
.end.
"And I tpll you," said Dorothy, catch
ing her breath and speaking with bit
ter slowness, 'that I shall not marry
him!"
"This to me! â your mother! â in my
"You shall not drive me!" cried Dor
othy passionately, her eyes roving sav
agely, like the eyes of a badgered ani
mal. "Am I to have no voice in dis
posal of myself? I tell you I shall
' marry whom I please! And since he
+ makes his proffer through you, tell the
creature Storrl that I loathe him!"
This last was also from the maga
zine, and Mrs. Hanway-Harley got it
off superbly. It mi.sed fire, so far as
Dorothy was concerned â Dorothy,
strung like a bow and now in full re
bellion.
â¢"It is you to have a care!" retorted
c Dorothy. "Papa and Uncle Pat shall
hear of this!"
"They will say as I say!" observed
Mrs. Hanway-Harley, who believed it.
"And If they should," cried Dorothy,
"I have stjli a resource!"
"Flight?" said Mrs. Hanway-Harley,
not without contempt.
"Marriage!" replied Dorothy, now as
.dry of eye as she was defiant. Bess
Markjln was assuredly right in her esti
mate of formalities and their saving and
securing worth. Â§*??:
"Marriage!" repeated Dorothy, and her
voice rang out in a composite note of love
c and triumph as she thought of Richard.
"Marriage!" Mrs. Hanway-Harley was
staggered. Here was a pathway of es
tape she had not counted on. "Whom
would you marry?"
' "Yoli shall not* know," said Dorothy.
' Mrs. Hanway-Harley saw truth in
Dorothy's red cheekâ she had been snow
UU nowâ saw it in her swimming eye and
o leaving bosom. Before she could phrase
Turther question Dorothy had left the
* room and Mrs. Hanway-Harley was
-beaten.
Somewhere in the unknown dark behind
Dorothy's stubborn will stood a man, and
that man loved Dorothy. She would draw
on his love and his loyalty and his cour
age to make her war! Mrs. Hanway-
Harley felt her defeat and sighed to think
how she had walked upon it blindfold.
But she was- not without military fair
ness; she must make her report.
Mrs. Hanway-Harley wrote Storri a
note, saying that, for reasons not to be
"dvercome, the honor of his hand must be
derfiea her house. While Mrs. Hanway-
Harley was writing Storrl, Dorothy, the
bafted. was writing her note to Richard.
And now you know why Dorothy sobbed
her troubled, bunted, harassed way Into
Richard's arms. . Â»\u25a0Â» \u25a0
Af.ter ten minutes of love and peace
Dorothj: was so much renewed that, word
for word, she gave Richard the entire
etpry. Â«.Â»;: '\u25a0'-
"What shall I do?" said Dorothy at the
close. "Tell me, dear, what am I to do?"
c â¢ "You are in no danger," said Richard,
in a manner of grim tenderness and fold
\u2666â¢ing her tight. "Before I'd see you marry
â¢ 'Storri I would kill him in the churchâ
* kill him at the altar rail!"
'."You must not kill him!" whispered
Â«* Dorothy, at once horrified and flattered.,,
. ''There's no chance," said Richard,
c witlf a Quaver of comic regret "Our civ
ilization has so narrowed the times that
.murdef Is Inexpressibly Inconvenient.
Â£>ne thing I might do. however."
."Whal Is that?"
â¢ "I might carry you off."
* . "Oh, that would never do!" said Doro
thy, as with a great sigh she crept more
and more Into Richard's arms, thinking
alj the time It would do, and do nicely.
CHAPTER X.
HÂ»w storrl Plotted a Vengeance.
â¢* Richard asked Dorothy if s6e had told
â¢ Bess. Xo. Dorothy had not told. Bess.
"Do you think, dear heart, I would tell
* anj' one befofe I had. told you?"
As the. most fitting reply to this ques
* lion Richard kissed Dorothy all qver
. again as though for the first time, and
, with a fervor that told how his soul was
In the work.
Bess was called In a? a consulting en
. 'glneer of hearts. That blonde tactician
* glanced over the situation with the eye
of "a field marshal. This was the result
oof her' survey. There must be no clan
destine marriage, no elopement. Dorothy
was In no peril; it was not a drawbridge
day of moated castlewicks and donjon
keeps. Damsels were no longer gagged
and bound and carried to the altar, and
e there wedded perforce to dreadful ogres.
Wherefore, a runaway match was not
neces^ary. Moreover, it would be vulgar;
and nothing: could justify vulgarity; J-)o
rothy and Richard should remain as they
were. They must continue to love; they
must learn to wait, and to take what ad
vantage the How of events provided.
"My -wisdom." quoth Bess, pausing as if
for congratulations, "my wisdom is,
doubtless, so much beyond my years as
to seem unearthly. It's due to the fact
that, although young, I've been for lone
the responsible head of the family."
Bess mentioned this latter dignified con
dition with complacency. It left her ex
empt from those troubles, like a bramble
pater?. Into v.hich Dorothy had pjunged.
Both Dorothy and Richard were inclined
to agree wl{h their monitress. Richard \u25a0
was too wholly of the battle-ax breed to
favor stealth and creeping about. It was
in his heart to marry Dorothy defiantly,
and at noon. Dorothy's reasons .were less
robust; she was thinking of . her father
and "Uncle Pat" and all their kindnesses.
She could not make up her loyal heart
to any step that smacked of treachery to
them. -":
"And yet," observed Kichard. v "here we
are where wp started." Then turning ta
Bess: "You have told us what we should
not do, and told us extremely well. Now
bend your sage .brows to the question of
what we ought to do. Or, *to phrase it
this fashion, what ought I to do?"
*'Go to Mrs. Hanway-Harley and ask
for her daughter."
Richard winced and made a wry face.
"I'd sooner go to Storri. The ' rascal .
might give me a reason for thrashing
him."
â¢ "You are on no account.^to mention
Dorothy's name to Storri." " ;f-".'V
"No?" somewhat ruefully.
"And you are to beat him only should
he mention Dorothy's name to you."
"I shall," and Richard brightened.
"Storri asked Mrs. Hanway-Harley for
her daughter. 1 should think you might,
summon up an equal courage." * -A
"But I haven't the advantage of being;
a Russian nobleman," returned . Richard, ",
with one of his cynical grins.. j t
"Still you must ask Mrs. Hanway-Har-^
ley for Dorothy; and no later, mind you,' 1
than to-morrow night." Bess tossed her
head as though a fiat had cone forth. '
"Well," said Richard, drawing a deep â¢
breath, "if you have any such junk as a
joss about the house I'd take It friendly
if you would burn a handful of jjraver
sticks in my Interest." Then, with all
love's softness, to Dorothy: "Your mother
will say Xo; she will not entertain your
views on poverty, little one."
Dorothy came behind Richard's chair
and pressed her cheek to his.
"Whatever she may say, whatever any
one may say, you, and only you, dearest,
shall have me," and Dorothy signed the
promise after the fashion popular with
lovers.
Storri came that evening to see Mrs.
Hanway-Harley. Both parties were act
ing, Storri affecting melancholy while he
was on fire: with passionate rage, and
Mrs. Hanway-Harley assuming the role
of the mother who, although >he regrets,
is still tenderly unwilling to control those
wronsly headstrong courses : upon which
her child is bent. There was a world of
polite fencing between Mrs. Hanway-Har
ley and Storri, in which each bore testi
mony to the esteem in which the other
was held. It was decided that Storri
should continue those dinners with the
Harleys; Dorothy might discover a final
wisdom. .
Storri told Mrs. Hanway-Harley that
he feared Dorothy had given her heart
to Richard. This admission was gall and
wormwood to the self-love of Storri. He
made it, however, and recalled Mrs. Han
way-Harley to. Dorothy's chatter concern-
Ing the mornlns talks between Richard
and Senator Hanway.
"That odious printer," said Storrl, who
called all newspaper people printers,
"comes each day to get his budget of
news from your illustrious brother, mad
am;* and. believe . me, your daughter
makes some sly pretext for being with
themâ with him, the odious printer! Bah!
I wish we were in Russia; I would
blow out the rogue's life like * a
candle! Why, my Czar would laugh
were so mean a belng : to succeed In ob
structing the love of .his Storri!"
Mrs. Hanway-Harley was struck by
the suggestion that Richard was Dor
othy's lover in the dark.'. She remem
bered Dorothy's teasing praises of
Richard and her talk of how saplently;.
he discoursed with "Uncle' Pat.'" The
praises occurred on that evening., when,
from her wisdom, she, Mrs. Hanway-
Harley, had warned her innocent child
against the error of entertaining one
gentleman with the merits of another.
Mrs. Hanway-Harley even brought to
mind the replies made by her innocent
child to those warnings; and her own
wrath began to stir as the suspicion
grew that her Innocent child had been\
secretly laughing at her. Like all shal-;
low folk, Mrs. Hanway-Harley prided'
herself upon being as deep as the.sea;
and it did her self-esteem no good to
think that she had been sounded, not
to say charted, by her own daughter,
who had gone steering in and out,
keeping always the channel *ot her
credulity and never once running
aground. Little lamps of anger lighted
their evil wicks in Mrs. Hanway-Har-'
ley's eyes as she thus reflected.
And that morning armful of roses?
No, Storri was not the moving cause of,
their fragrant . appearance -upon the
Harley premises. Storrl regretted that
he had not once bethought him of this
delicate attention. Mrs. Hanway-Har
ley wrung her hands. It was Dorothy
who first planted in her the belief: that
the flowers were from Storrl! Oh, the
artful Jade! That was the cause of her
timorous objections when Mrs. Han
way-Harley, with the. fond; yet; honor
able curiosity of a mother, spoke of
mentioning those flowers to Storrl. The
perjured Dorothy, was aware of their,
felon origin; doubtless, she even then
encuoraged the miserablo Richard ' in
his love. \u25a0
As these lights, burst one after the
other upon Mrs. Hanway-Harley she

could, have punished her own -dullness
by beating her head against the wall.
However, she restained herself and
closed by inviting. Storrl to dinner on
the next day but one. Storrl, still keep
ing up his tender melancholy, thanked
Mrs. Hanway-Harley, accepted, and
wit many bows and many sighs to im
pre&j upon Mrs. Hanway*-Harley his
stricken heart, backed himself out into
the night. â¢ J/-Y-
When Storri was gone Mrs. Hanway-
Harley resolved on an instant talk with
Dorothyâ no more the Innocent, but the
artful 6ne. She would make a last at
tempt to wring from her the name of
that lover of the shadows. Should It
be" Richard â and she was sure of it â
that aspiring journalist must never
again cross the Harley threshold.
Mrs. Hanway-Harley, who had the
merit of expedition, repaired^at once to
Dorothy's room. That obdurate beauty
was half dressed, and her maid had
just finished arranging her hair in two
raven braids â thick as a ship's cable,
they were. As Mrs. Hanway-Harley
entered Dorothy glanced up with half
wistful eye. Poor child! she was hop
ing her mother might have softened
from that granite attitude of the morn*
ing! But no, there was nothing ten
der in, the selfish, austere gaze; at that,
the spirit of the old astronomical an
cestor who. with his water pans and
gateposts, know the : earth was flat,
began to chafe within Dorothy's girlish
bosom. <
Mrs. Hanway-Harley came to a dig
nified.halt in the middle of the -room.
"Cora, you may go," said Mrs. Han
way-Harley. %'&?:
The black maid gave, a parting
touch. to the braids, in which she con
trived}' to mingle sympathy, and affec
tion,'for with the wisdom of her caste
she'knew of-porothy's love and. gave it
her approval. .. . â¢ .
-.7 "Dorothy," said Mrs. Hanway-Harley,
whJÃtthey. were, alone, and speaking
in - a Tpigh/ superior vein, "I have com*
for the rfamfe bf'that man." ,
"Mr/ Storms," returned Dorothy, in
[tones; which' .for steadiness " matched
alrsrHanway-Harley's. , ..,,,
â¢ the name so. much as the
relentless ' frankness that furnished fit
which overcame Mrs. Hanway-Harley.
She sat down with an emphasis so sud
den that it was as though .her;, knees
were glass and the blow had \broken,
them.- Once in the chair, : shelwaggled
her head dolorously and moaned out
against upstart vulgarlans^whd, with

"Don't; don't touch .me!", she cried.

she cried: "You" have. â¢ disgraced .merr

"Barbara., sit flown!" commanded Banx
itor Hanway:
Mrs. Hanway-Harley sat down: an*
was, ; with the last word. In awe of her
eminent brother. Senator Hanway arose
and towered above* her with f orblidlns
Brow. The threat to bar theÂ» Harley, doora
to Richard had set him ago* with angry
apprehensions. "What! should his best
ajent of politics, onÂ» who was at one*

"Was* a "White House to be lost by such
tawdry argument? â¢ Forbidding Richard
the door might- of Itself appear a meager
matter, but who was to say what results
might not eprinjr from it? Senator Han
way had seen the gravest catastrophles
grow from - reasons small as mustard
seed! A city is burned, and the confla
gration has Its start in a. cow and & can
dle! Mrs. Hanway-Harley shall not put
his hopes to jeopardy in squabbles over
Dorothy and' her truant love. Senator
Hanway felt the hot anxiety of onÂ« who,
bearing a priceless vase through the
streets, Is Jostled by the inconsiderate
crowd. Domestic politics and national
politics had come to a clash. m ; ;
Senator Hanway stood staring at Mrs.
Hanway-Harle-y. He required time to
gather control of hlmseLf. and lay out a>l
verbal line of march. He decided for ths \
lucid, icy style; It was His favorite man
ner In the Senate.
"Barbara," said \u25a0 he, "give careful ear
to what I shall say. I do not request. I
do not command^ I tell you what must
be done. I do not interfere between
you and Dorothy; I Interfere, only be
tween you and Mr. Storms. That young
man is necessary to my plans. He I*
to come to this study, freely, and without
interference. Xor are you, on any oc
casion, or for any cause, to affront him
or treat him otherwise than .with re
spect."
"But, brother." urged JMrs. Hanway-
Harley, "he has trapped Dorothy into
a promise of marriage." ,',\u2666
"Why do you object to him?" -.-;
"He has no fortune; the man's a beg
gar!"
"He has his money from the Dally
" Tory say five thousand a, year. That is
as much aalam Daid for beinsr Senator."
"There is no parallel! Your salary may
be five thousand, but you make twenty
fold that sum." which was quite true.
"Barbara," remarked Senator Hanway
reprovingly, returning to the original
bone" of dispute, "why should you insist
on this young man owning millions before
he can think of Dorothy? You had noth- â¢
Ing. John had nothing, when you mar
ried. You should remember these things."
â¢ Mrs. Hanway-Harley refused to remem
ber. There was no reason why she â¢
should. ' Dorothy was the present iaaue, ;
and Dorothy wasâ or would beâ rich.
' "I won't go Into the business anyj
further," retorted Senator Hanway at
last, with a gesture of Irritation and dis
gust. "I simply tell you that Mr. Storms
Is neither to be affronted nor driven
away. Should you disregard my wishes.
Barbara, I say to you plainly that I
myself will bring the young people to- m
gether. send for a preacher, and marry
them In this very study. I am ,not to
lose a Presidency because you choose to
play the fool."
Mrs. Hanway-Harley, illustrious in all
her diamonds, upon the next evening re- .
celved Richard in vast stata. She pro
posed to imDress him with her splendors.
Dorothy, in anticipation of the meeting
between mother and lover, had gone
.across to Bes3: her nervousness must
have support. . . .
; Richard, whose diplomacy was barbaric
and proceeded on straight lines, Mra.
Hanway-Harley of his love for Dorothy.
\u25a0 As his handsome face lighted up, - x even
â¢Mrs. Hanway-Harley was not unswept
of admiration. She could loo* into Rich
ard's eyes and see for herself those gray
I beauties: of tenderness and truth that bad
won Dorothy to his side. They â¢ mlcht
have won even Mrs. Hanway-Harley had
she not "been a mother. "What if he wera
tender, what if he were true? He had
no fortune, no place: even the Admirable
Crichton. wanting social station and the
riches whereon to base it. would have
been Impossible.
"When -Richard had ended his love
taleâ .which, considering that for all
his outward fortitude he was inward
ly quaking, he told full eloquentlyâ
Mrs Hanway-Harley composed hersalf
for reply. She hardly required, those
warnings of Senator Hanway; therÂ«Â»
was no wish now : to insult" or humblo
him. In truth. Mrs. Hanway-Harley^
was in the best ; possible temper to
carry forward her, side of the confer
ence In manner most creditable to har
self and most helpful for her purposes.
More than ever, since she had neard
him, she knew the perilous sway this
\u25a0man must own. over her daughter.
While he talked the deep, true tones
were like a spell: the great, tender,
persistent will ot a man In loving ear
nest seemed as with a thousand soft,
resistless hands to draw her whither it
â¢would. Even she. Mrs. Hanway-Har
- ley. selfish, guarded,^worldly, cold, was
shaken and all but conquered beneath
the natural hypnotic power of The
male when speaking, thinking, feeling.
moving from the heart. Oh. she would
warrant her daughter loved this wiz
ard! She herself was driven to fence
against his pleadings to keep from
grantlrig* .all. he, "asked. But fence she
did; ' Mrs. Hanway-Harley remembered
that she was a mother, an American
mother, whose daughter <-had be*n
asked in wedlock by a Count. She
\u25a0 must protect that daughter from tha
wizard who would only love.tO'bllgat.
Mrs. Hanway-Harley never spoke to
more advantage. She did not doubt
Mr. Storms* honesty, she did not dis
trust his love: but woman. could not
live by love alone, and she had h*r
duty as a mother. Dorothy had bseri
lapped In luxury; it was neither right
nor safe - that her daughter should
marry downhill. Mrs. Hanway-Harley's,.,
voice- was smoothly even. Mr. Storms
must forgive a question. Something of
the kind had been asked before, but
changes might have intervened. Had
Mr. Storms any expectations from Mr.
Gwynn?
"Madam," replied Richard, whlla a
queer smile played about his mouth, a
smile whereof the reason was by no
means clear to Mrs. Hanway-Harley.
"madam, I shall be wholly TlionlT lion 1 f s s t ;
Llvlng or dead, gift or will. I snail
never have a shilling from Mr. Qwynn.
"Then, Mr. Storms." returned -Â«rs.
Hanway-Harley. "I ask you whether 1
would be Justified in wedding my
daughter to poverty?"
"But Is money, that is. much money,
so important?" pleaded Richard. .'I
have education, health, brainsâ in mod
erationâand love to prompt all three.
That should not mean beggary, even
though It may not mean prodigious
wealth." " "- '\u25a0'.-;.

Mrs. Hanway-Harley bowed.
"My daughter, however, must not be
bound by any promise."
"Your daughter, madam," returned
Richard, with a color of pride, "shall
never be bound by me. Though I hold a
score of promises I would have no wife
who does not come to me of her free
choice. I do not look on love as a busi
ness proposition."
"Older people- do," responded Mrs.
Hanway-Harley dryly.
"Madam," said Richard, "I have only
one more question to ask. What Is to be
my attitude toward your daughter while
1 am searching for that fortune?"
It was here that Mrs. Hanway-Harley
made her greatest stroke; she reached
Richard where he had no defense.
"Your attitude. Mr. Storms, toward my
daughter I shall leave to you for adjust
ment as a man of honor." .;..-;.'.
Richard crossed the street to Dorothy
and told her what had passed. Dorothy
kissed him and cried over him and made
a wall against their darkling fate.
"How I wish papa was poor!" cried
Dorothy. "I wish he didn't have a dol
lar!" Then, conscience-stricken: "No, I
don't! Poor pop; he doesn't hate money,
if I do." .-.".-_
Richard took Dorothy's sweet face be
tween his hands and looked into her
eyea.
"You will believe me, darling?"
"Yes!" -^ !>
"Then don't weep, don't worry. I prom
ise that within the year you shall be my
wife. I'll find the way to find the money."
"And hear me promise," returned Doro
thy. "Money or no money, I'll become
your wife what day you will."
Of course, alter such a speech there be
fell a sweet world and all of foolish ten
derness; but since the scandalized Ajax
would not stay to witness It neither
shaJl you. ; .-
Mrs. Hanway-Harley said nothing to
Dorothy of her interview with Richard;
she appeared to believe that Richard
had saved her that labor. There was a
kind of sneer in this. Feeling the
sneer. Dorothy put no Questions; she
was willing, in her resentment, to have
it understood that Richard had told
her. Why 6hould he not? â she was to
be his wife! Dorothy would have been
proud to proclaim her troth from the
housetops. >
Mr?. Hanway-Harley had Storri to
dinner. \ Dorothy, when he was an
nounced, sought her room. A moment
later Mrs. Hanway-Harley was at the
door. She came in cool, collected, no
trace of anger. Why did not Dorothy
come down to dinner? Dorothy did not
come down to dinner because Dorothy
did not choose.
"You do not ask Mr. Storms to din
ner." N said Dorothy, her color coming
and her eyes beginning to glow. "I
will not meet your Storri."
'"Mr. Storms is not In our set. dear,"
said Mrs. Hanway-Harley coldly.
"He is In my heart," returned Dor
othy.
The self-willed one seated herself
stoutly and never another word could
Mrs. Hanway-llarlcy draw from her.
Storri received the excuses for Dor
othy's vacant place at the table which
Mrs. Hanway-Harley oflcwd; for all
that he read the reason of her absence
and h's pride fretted under it ixs under
a lash.
New Year's day, and the diplomatic
reception at the White House. The
President stood in line with his Cabi
net people and the others tired by. Rich
ard, being utterly the democrat, was,
of course, utterly the aristocrat, since
these be extremes that never fail to
meet. Wherefore Richard did not take
his place In the procession and waver
painfully forward, at a snail's pace, to
shake the Presidential hand. It was
a foolish ceremony a.t which Richard's
self-respect rebelled. There was no
hand, no masculine har.d.< at least.
which Richard would wait in line to
grasp.
Richard, while declining: to become
part of '-he pageant, looked -jn. It was
worth while as a study in human na
ture. -The President peculiarly claimed
his notice; by cverj' sign it was this
man who would oppose Senator Han
way, if the latter gentleman achieved
his ambition and was put forward to
lead his party's ticket. Richard com
pared the present handshaking Presi
dent with Senator Hanway, the latter
being thereby advanced. The President
was a smooth, smug: personage, of an
appetite rather than an ambition for
office. Ambition is a captain, appetite
a camp follower; for which reason the
President was one who would never
lead, never oppose a movement. Kssen
tially he was of the candidate class. In
deed, he had, as an individual, the best
characteristics of a canal. lie was nar
row, even, currentless, with a mental
fall of two feet in the mine.'
He lived conservatively between his
banks, and went never so foolishly lucid
as to show you how shallow he was.
Jurt n trine thick, he seemed to the eye
as deep as the skies were high; any six
foot question, however, would have
sounded him.
And yet he was in his <lay much lauded
ns a safe executive. There may have
been truth in that. Your man of timid.
rV.m and shallow mediocrities, comparable
to a canal, is not to be despised. He will
not be the Mississippi, truly; he will
weep away no bridges, overflow no re
gions roundabout; no navies will battle
on his bosom; .the world in its glqnt com
merces will not make of him a thorough
fare. But he will mean safety and profit
for a hone of little special selfish inter
ests, and that is the sort of President a
day dominated of Money demands. In
the far Southwest the cattle barens knock
the horns off cattle; a hornless steer
comes to the slaughter pen more quietly
and with less of threat to those who han
cle him. In a day when Money rules as
King Its first care is to knock the horns
off originality and brains. Money wants
no great horned mental forces roaming
the world; they might become a threat,
Rfchard thought on these matters as he
considered this conservative, careful
White House one, whose, pains had ever
teen to think nothing that hadn't been
thought, say nothing that hadn't been
sitid. do nothing that hadn't been done.
"He is like a bucket of spring water,"
thought Richard, as lit turned away,
"cool, pure, tasteless. But there isift
enough of him to put out a. fire, or swim
a boat, or turn the wheel of any mill oi
moment."
Richard went into the green drawing
room, where the younger, gayer spirits
were "receiving behind. the line." There
he saw Dorothy and Bess. Before he
could go to them he causht the snarling
accents of Storri. He turned; that Russ
was almost at his elbow. Storri. as
though for Richard's ear. was saying to
a vapid young man whom Richard had
seen at "the club:
â¢â¢Oh! that is Miss Harleyâ the onewith
the blue eyes and black hair. Bad com
bination, believe -me! I, who am a gen
tleman â a Russian gentleman â give my
word that blue eyes and black hair mean
treason to a lover. No, I can't take- you
to her; she has shown a preference for
me, and I do not care to distinguish . her
by too much notice until I have thought
her over. On my soul, yes; I must think
her over!" / .
Richard's hand fell heavy and rude on
Storri's shoulder. ../,-/ 7
"Come with me," said he. *
Storri- had not coÂ»\ntcd on this; those
sacred White House walls should have
protected him. He looked appeallngly at
his friend. -..-'â¢â¢
"Your friend will pardon you," said
Ricnard, coolly, "and, for this time, you
shall come back safe."
Richard drew Storri to a window,
where they were by themselves. _
"Pay heed to what I shall say," grit
ted Richard, and his eyes gave forth a
gray glimmer like- a saber suddenly
unsheathed, "you must never take Miss
Harley's name upon your lips. Should
you do so I shall twist your neck as
once I twisted your fingers." . \u25a0;\u25a0
Storri began a spluttering stammer
of protest and reproach.
* "Don't hector me!" whispered Rich
ard with a sharp fervor of ferocity
that? made Storri start, "or. when next
we meet in the street I'll take my
cane and beat you like a dog!"
Storri turned and tried to hide \u0084the
fear that fed upon him with a tinge
of swagger. This in the White House
â the palace of their president! Storri
was more and more convinced that, the
Americans were a rabble and not a
people!'.
"Remember!" said Richard, and the
tones were like a threat of death.
That evening early Richard met Dor
othy at Bess Marklin's. He made no
revelations touching his colloquy with
Storri. There was a thick down-come
of snow and the new flakes covered
the street like feathers to a fluffy
depth of two inches. As Dorothy and
Richard reached the sidewalk on Dor
othy's return to the Harley house.
Richard, with the abrupt remark.' "l'll
save you from the snow, .my dear!"
caught Dorothy in those Pict,arms and
strode across. -\ . .
Dorothy was so amazed by. this gal
lant attention that she was over be
fore she spoke a word. As Richard
landed her, light as a leaf, within her
father's portals, she* said in remon
strance:
â¢ "What made you do it? Did you not
see that odious Storri coming?-'
"It was for Storri I dfd it. I wanted
to emphasize some remarks I had the
honor to make to him this afternoon."
Dorothy fluttered to her room to prcV
pare for the 7% o'clock dinner, whilo
her unconventional loved one . turned
with a hope of meeting Storri. ~. The
fierce truth was, Richard,, who, as you
have been told, was at bottom full .as
savage as the Russian, liad gone hun
gering for hostilities with tlutt noble
man. .Storri's comments on Dorothy
had exploded all the hateful powder in
Richard's composition.
.Storri may have had some . glint 'Qf
Richard's feeling; sure it was that, al-.
though bent upon dining at the Har
ley house when he was so unexpected-"
ly treated by Richard and Dorothy to
that picture of Paul and Virginia, mod
ernized, he wheeled upon his heel and
disappeared. Richard, search as \u25a0" he
might, met never the. shadow nor the
ghost of Storri. . "
Storri went direct to his rooms. AH the
wolves of anger and jealousy and, hate
were tearing at his; soul.' Richard's
threats; and he too craven' to make re
ply! Dorothy in Richard's arms; and. he
powerless to interfere!' Thu "day had "been '?\u25a0
v day of fire for him. He must make a.
plan; he must have, revenge.. â¢, .'-L-V-^
Full of a black" resolve,^ Storri tore, open r ,
his desk. He took out those ' French '
fharcs and fluttered" the little package .of
papers* between his angry """lingers 'â¢ as- ,
though the feel of them could give him ';
consolation. He looked at those poor for-;
geries of his name by Mr. Harley. Then
he wrcte a note to that gentleman and-,
urged him. by every name of business, to'
call without delay. Mr. Harley must
come at once. The note in, the hands of :
a messenger, Storri commenced to rove
the floor like a rage-frenzied beast.
"We shall see!" he cried, tossing his
hands. "I have the father in mylingersâ \u25a0
aye! in these fingers! I can pull' him to
pieces like a toasted larkâ yes, limb from
pinion, I, Storri, shall tear him asunder!
I can torture, I can crush!. He is mine
to destroy! My power over him shall be'
my power over her! The stubborn-.Doro
thy shall come to me on her kneesâ to
me, Storri, whom she has affronted! She
shall beg my favor for her father! .What
should be the ransom? Who shall meas
ure my demands when I have conquered?
I, who am to have my neck twistedâ l,
who am to be beaten like a dogâ l_shall
name to her ' the terms. They shall be
ruinâ ruin for her, ruin for him, ruin for
all who have put their slights upon me:
The proud' Dorothy must give .me/herself
to buy her father's safety! Her pride
shall creep, her face lie In the dust!. She
shall i>e Storri's! When her beauty fades
âin a yearâ in two yearsâ l will cast her
aside;*!, Storri, whom these feeble'peo
ple have defied!" ' \u25a0
In the midst of the ravings of'the hate
racked Storri there came a tap. A card'
was thrust in. Storri's onyx eyes gloated
as he read the' name.
Â»'Harky!" said Stoiri. Then tp the^onc'
at the door: "Have him up!" His voice
sunk to an exultant whisper as he heard
. Mr. Harley's step in the hall. "Now; is
my vengeance to begin the feast!,. They
shall know, these feeble ones," what it is
to brave a Russian!"

IloT<r air. Hnrloy^ Found Himself a
Forjjer. .
In the economy of the Harleys the gray
mare was the . better horse, at least the
gray mare thought so. Mrs. . Hanway-
Harley put no faith in Mr. Harley. He
was an 'acaulescent- if not an -obedient
husband and rather than bicker "would
submit tp be ' moderately henpecked.
When the henpecking was carried to ex
cess Mr. Harley did not- peck back; he
clapped on his hat, bolted for the door
and escaped. These measures, while ef
fective' in so far that they carried Mr.
Harley* beyond the immediate range of
Mrs. Hanway-Harley's guns, left that
wife and mother with a depleted opinion
of Mr: Harley. She could not respect one
who failed to give her battle, being of
fered proper urovocation: and in that
Mrs. llanway-Harley was one with all
the world. To fight is now and then an
obligation.
Thinking thus lightly of , Mr. Harley
and remembering,' too, that Dorothy could
coil him round her finger, quell him with
a tear, Mrs. Hanway-Harleydid not take
him into -her confidence as \u25a0 to . those \u25a0 love
proffers cf Storri,' and Dorothy's rebellion.
What would have been' the good? MrJ
Harley*s M advice .was nothing, while his
countenance, as far as it went, would be
given to Dorothy the \u25a0 disobedient. â¢ Also,
he* would go to Senator Hanway with the
tangle. Such a course might bring her
brother actively upon the field; and Mrs.
Hanway-Harley had gleaned enough from
her talk with Senator Hanway to know
that, should he assume a part, It would
not be in support of her interest. These
considerations came arid went- in- Mrs.

came to pass. that, as = Mr. Harley com

hates \u25a0 and commands and defiances and
promises and intermediations which made
busy the closing days of the; recent. year
for Dorothy. Richard, Bess, Storri, and
Mrs. Hanway-Harley. Mr. ! Harley pos
sessed: an: excellent appetite, that -New.
Year's evening; it might have been dimin
ished of edge had his ignorance been less.
Mrs. Hanway-Harley looked for Storri
-to, drop -in., but since the promise of his
coming was: known only to herself^-she
did not, can*'. to; furnish the news of it. to
Dorothy the rebelliousâ the failure of that

and Mr.' Harley especially derived great
benefit therefrom.. ;.â¢ . ,â¢ â¢;.\u25a0'-..
- Mr". Harley had, just finished his final
glass of wine, and was saying, something
fictional about- a gentleman': at--the ! Ar
lington upon whom he ought to, call, and
what a bore calling upon the fictional
gentleman would be, when Storri's note
cameinto his hands. He glanced it over,
and then seized upon it as ths very thing
to furnish a look of integrity to his story
of the : - mythical- one. He gave the note
a petulant slap with the back of his fin
gers, and remarked ,
"I dcclaxe! Hare he is writing me to
come at once."
Mr. Harley got Into his hat and coat,
and then got^ into the street, observing
;i3 he did so that he feared thebuslness
in hand might keep him far into the
morning. ; â¢
The guilty truth. was this: Mr. Harley
concealed a* private purpose to plAy cards
with' a select circle of statesmen*] who
'owned a taste, to begin the year ."with
draw poker :at Chamberllh's.- However,
there existed In the destinies of 'Mr: I lar

among the weaknesses of Mr. \u25a0 Harley.- Be

like his Sunday coat, he employed; it only
on rare occasions, and when advantage
' 'could- ".be arrived'- at in no other; way.

before. Mr. "Harley would coOl.him into

'1 "Comeâ you Harleyâ you John Harley,"

watched him. Storri himself did not care
to push for extremes. In. his vain egot
ism, which was like a madness, he would
not have scrupled to brand Mr. Harley
as a forger had he been defied. But such
a step was not what Storri. aimed at. It
.was. his own possession of Dorothy rath
er, than a vengeance upon'-Mr. . Harley â¢
that he sought to compass. Therefore,
as Storri made plain his power ' and
threatened, its' exercise, .he considered
Mr. Harley with the narrow lntentrfess;
of .a lynx, lie was striving to measure
the other's resistance. He noted the hor-."

"But. why" do we lose .our self-control?"
cried Storri, .voice]' and "manner changed

You approve; your wife approves! The
daughter is young; she must- bÂ« wooed
before she is won. What then: Is Storri
to despair* The lady would put Storri's
love to tluj" test. She says: 'You must
court me, before you shallowed me. You
are' not to have me without a struggle,
lest you think me of small worth.' The
lady, has pride; the lady has discretion:
the lady sets a value upon herself. Why
should she not? It compels me, Storri,
to appreciate her charms still more ana
more. There; I have painted the state of
affairs. I have now but two requests; I
will not call those requests commands."
and Storri rustled the French shares sug
gestively. "ICo, I am to call them re
quests. Can you not exercise a paternal
authority to have your daughter receive
my respectful visits? Also, can you not
exercise it to pÂ».U an end. absolutely an
ertd, to her interviews with this Mr.
Storms?"
"How can I compel her?"
"You must do it!" roared Storri. hi 3
anger taking renewed edge. "You must,
you shall! What! am I to be thwarted,
affronted, undone by a girl? ,Two things
I demand: she is to see me; and she is
not to see that Storms. Do I ask much .
It is little for a child to pay for a father's
safety, little for a man to pay fcr his own.
What forger or what forger's daughter
has made such terms? 'Bah!"
The insult scarcely roused Mr. Harley;
he was stunned, his face was clammy with
sweat. It was like a dream of horror:
Look where he would, there sho-wed
but the. one door of escape. Storri was
to see Dorothy; Dorothy was not to see
Richard.
After all, it did not present unbearable
conditions. More6ver, time would bring
about its shifts. In a week, in a month,
in six .months, Mr. Harley might have
Storri helpless as Storrl now had him.
It was "a case for delay; Mr. Harley
must have breathing space.
"That is all you require?" said' Mr.
Harley, his voice the same dry, husky
croak.' "You. are to see my daughter, and
Mr. Storms is not to see her?"
"Do that, and I will answer the
balance!" cried Storri. "Do that, and she
will love meâ she will be my wife!" :.-.
. "And no more talk ofâ of forgeries?"
"My dear Mr. Harley!" exclaimed'Stor
ri, .."I am a 1a 1 gentlemanâ a Russian gen
tleman. I ask you. In candor, does a
gentleman arrest his wife's father on a

friends, are we not?â we, who are. to be
in closer alliance when your daughter be
comes my Countess "wife. Bah! who shall
talk of forgeries then?!'
The evening was still youngâ 9 o'clockâ
when Mr. Harley found himself again in
the street, bending hid slow step home
ward. ,He was wholly adrift now from
any thought of those speculative onps at
Chamberlin's. What Storri had said en
grossed him miserably. He entertained
no doubt but what Storri would carry
into execution those threats^ of arrest
'should'; his r' desires concerning Dorothy
meet with opposition. The fear o{ his
own disgrace appalled Mr. Harley. He
did not Jack for courage, but his inter-,
view with Storri had buried. him beneath
a ppell of terror.
. It. was peculiarly a condition to fright
en' Mr. Harley to the core. He* was
coarse way. of the fortune hs
had gathered. He had based himself. on
his position as a business, not to say a
legislative, force, and used It to patronize,
not always delicately,* those among his
fellows who had not climbed so high. In
exacting what was a money due he had
ever proceeded with but little scruple. He
had measured his right by measuring his
strength,, and had not failed to take his
pound of flesh.. In brief, Mr. Harley, pos
sessing, like many another fat gentle
man,those numerous porcine traits of
brutal selfishness and a lack of sentiment
or sympathy, had considered always his
own interests, follbwing them though
they, took him roughshod over another's
. dearest, hopes. For which good reasons
Mr. .\u25a0 Harley had foes, and :knew\it; there
would.be.no absence of rejoicing over his
" downfall. .-1 '.'_,'\u25a0' '.Â»... .
But ~ what-'could Mr. Harley offer for
defense. -What, \u25a0beypnd mere ' compli
ance: with Storri's wishes,- might
avert, those calamities that seemed
"swinging In the air. above ' him?
-He' considered everything, and dc
yiscrV nothing; he was* like a. man
"without, eyes or*, as one shut .in V by
'night." :, In his 'desperation : a flighty
thought of taking Storri's life appealed
-to him for one murderous moment. It
.was .only for a. moment, and then, he
â¢thrust ir . aside with :;i shudder; not

standing" still; "he must push on in
\u25a0\u25a0 some \u25a0â¢.direction.
\u25a0 'Mr^Harley, being himself a business
. soul, did 'riot omit* to consider : how. far
Storri might be held at bay by shpwins
htm,, the certain "destruction :of Credit
Magellan should he "persist to the bit

war: ,'Mri might be disgraced.
destroyed;' but what .then? Storri's
plans: would [ assuredly bo trampled
.flat; \u25a0.millions, about to come into his
hands, would be swept away.
i ' j 'These, "as 'arguments* to be addressed
to Stbrri. -no 1 sooner entered the mind
f offMr. Harley than he dismissed them
.us* offeringr : no solution â¢of his *ptril3.
He had,felt. rather than seen.the "baV
v'barlsm "of, Storri â¢ beneath the: tissue of
\u25a0:'* what thsit nobleman would j have; styled
- his ; elegrafif. refinement/ ; Storri was -a
V coward, and therefore Storri was ma
i'lignaritt!- he had shown, as ho' -went
disgrace to^Mr.^ Harley, that
of evil \u25a0 which ;is : remarked"> in
f and cruel children. Storri was
- dominated of a passion' for revenge;
under sway or tnat passton no ccanca
of .money loss would stay him; he
would sacrifice all * and begin hi 3
schemes . anew before he would deny
himself those vainglorious trlumpa
upon which he had set his heart. He
hated Richard; he hungered for Dor
othy; and Mr. Harley knew how ha
would go to every extravagant extent
tn feeding: those two sentiments.
Mr. Harley sighed dismally as he re
viewed theso conditions; he could
io nothing, and must serve, or seem to
serve, the Tlllain humor of Storri.
What were those two demands? Storri
must meet Dorothy, and Richard must
dot. . There was no help; Mr. Harley
in his present stress would see Dorothy
md beÂ£ her co-operation. He would
not tell the whole story, but he would
3ay that he was borne upon by trou
ble and ask her to acquiesce in Storri's
conditions. He would promise 'that
those conditions were not to live for
ever.
Deciding thus. Mr. Harley went for
ward on his homeward course; he must
see Dorothy without delay, for ha
would be upon the rack until tha pain
ful conference was over. The night
was chill as New Year's nights hava
v right to be. and yet Mr. Harley was
fain to mop his forehead as thoujrh *t
\u25a0were. the dog days. As he neared his
own door his reluctant pace became as
slow as- sick men find the night of
time. ,
There had come no one to the Harley
New Year's, evening to engage tha po
lite attentions of Mrs. Hanway-Harley,
and that lady, being armored to J tha
teeth, in the name of comfort had re
tired to her' own apartments with a
purpose t to unloose what buttons and
remove what pins and' untie what
strings stood between her and a great
bodily relief. Dorothy was of neither
the size nor the years at which women
torture themselves, and, having no
quarrel with her buttons and pins and
strings, sat alone in the library. She
was deep in a novel that reeled with
ardent love and had fallen to despis
ing the lover because he did not re
semble Richard.
It was in the library that Mr. Har
ley came seeking Dorothy. When he
found her he stood stock still N unable
to speak one word of all that tide of
talk which would be necessary to
bring before her h^ dangerous perplex
ities and the one manner of their pos
sible relief. \u2666
Dorothy at his step looked up,
pleased to have him home so early.
She was about to say as much, but at
sight of him the words perished on her
tongue. It was as though her heart
were touched with ice^ Mr. Harley's
countenance had been of that quasi
claret hue called rubicund. It was now
turned gray and pasty and his cheeks,
as firmly round as those of a trumpet
er, were pouched and fallen as with the
palsy of age. He looked ten years
worse than when he went forth two
hours before.
Dorothy sprang up In alarm; she
feared that he was ill.
"Let me call mamma!" she cried; "let
me call Uncle Pat! You are sick."
"No; call nobody!" said Mr. Harley
feebly, and speaking with difficulty.
â¢'I'm^not ill; I'll be right in a moment."
Then he had Dorothy back into her
chair, gazing upon her the while In a
stricken way, as though she were
nangman or headsman, and he before
her for execution. lir. Harley was
held between terror of Storri and
shame for what he must say to Dor
othy. Wondering: what fearful blow
had fallen upon them Dorothy sat fac
ing her father the color of death.
"Tell me. papa," she whispered, with
a terror in her tones, "tell me what has
happened."
Despair brought a sickly calmness to
Mr. Harley; he cleared his mind with a
struggle and controlled himself to
speak. He would say all at once and
leave the rest with Dorothy.
"Dorothy," he began, the Iron effort
he was making being plainly appar
ent, "Dorothy, I have had a talk with
that scoundrel without Ti conscience.
Count Storri. I do not pretend that I
come. willingly to you from him. I tell
you, however, that I am fearfully with
in ihat villain's- power, and cannot help
myself. No, I've done no crime, but
none the less he has it in his hands to
cover me with disgraceâ destroy me. and
every sign of me. from the midst of re
spectable men. \i would avail nothing
should I show you how he spread a snare
for my feet, and how blindly I walked
into It. I can only say again that he has
me helpless, hand and foot; I am his to
make or break in all that a man of honor
or station holds dearest. He can cover
me with Infamy at will; he can unloose
upon me an avalanche of disgrace, and
with the one blow crush us all. I keep
back nothing, exaggerate nothing. I mere
ly lay bare to you what ia. Once the
stroke falls I shall never again hold up
my head. Indeed, I shall not live to see
it fall, for when I know It Is inevitable
I shall take mv own life."
Mr. Harley pause* a moment to recall
his coolness, while Dorothy, her little'
hands crushed between her knees, sat
panting like a spent hare.
"I have given you my precise position,"
continued Mr. Harley, with a sort of
hopelessness. "I shall now tell you the
conditions upon which my safety depends.
They rest with you; 1 stand or fall as you
decide." Dorothy tried to soeak, but her
voice died on her lips. "If you receive
Count Storri, not as a lover, but as an
acquaintance, or, if you will, a friend;
and If you have no further meetingâ that
Is. for a monthâ or perhaps twoâ or at, the
most threeâ have no further Interviews,
I say"â Mr. Harley blundered a trifle as
he saw Dorothy's face whitening with the
sorrows he was laying upon herâ "have
no further interviews with Mr. Storms, I
am saved. Forgive me. forgive your
father who has so failed of his duty that,
instead of protecting you. he comes to
you for protection. There is no more:
You have my fortune, my good repute,
my life in your charge. If you meet
Count Storri in friendship. If you refuse
Mr. Storms, lam secure. Should you fail
of either, then, by heart and soul! I
think it 13 my end!"
CHAPTER XII.
How Mr. Popllaer Was Inspired.
\u25a0 Next to Richard, Dorothy worshiped
her father. "Women never weigh men
closely; with them it is the kindness of
men that counts, and all her life no one
could . have been more generously . affec
tionate than was Mr. Harley to Dorothy.
And now her estimate of him became
her. memory of his unflagging goodness;
and this kept her from harsh Judgment as
he' told what heartbreaking sacrifices she
must make. Nor did she distrust a syl
lable: nor would she ask for explanation.
The latter she would avoid; it was enough,
that Storri held her father at hi 3 horrid
mercy. As against the setting forth in
detail of Storri's cruel power she in
stinctively closed her ears as she would
have shut her eyea against a fearsome
sight. Dorothy had never a. question;
and when Mr. Harley was done she seem-Ed simply to bow to the will of event*
too strong for her to cope with.
"But you must never ask mÂ© to marry
that man!" cried Dorothy. There went
a tremor through her words that marked
how deep of root was the feeling that
prompted them. "I couldn't, wouldn't
marry him I Before that I would die
yes, and die a gain I You must not ask
it!" and she lifted up her face, all wrung
with j>aln and anxious terror.
"I shall never ask it!" declared Mr.
Harley; and he spoke stoutly, for the
worst was over and his heart was com-
Ir.g back. This . rave Dorothy a better
confidence, and she began to hope that
things in the end might come fairer than
they threatened. "No," repeated Mr. Har
ley with even greater courage, and
smoothing; her black, thick hair In a fath
erly way, "you shall never be asked to
marry the scoundrel. That I promise; -
and let him do his worst."
And now, when both were measurably
recovered from the shame and the shock \
of It, Mr. Harley began to elaborate. He
went no further, however, than Just to
point out how nothing was really required
of Dorothy beyond those* common courte
sies rood women exhibit to what men
the respectable chances of existence bring
into their society. He said nothing, ask
ed nothing concerning her lore for Rich
ards he appeared to consider that love
admitted, and found no fault with it.
What ht impressed upon Dorothy was the
present danger of her love's display, and
hjw his safety retted upon her not meet
ing with Richard for a spaoe. Surely
that might be borne; It would not be for
long. Given room wherein to work, he,
Mr. Harley, would find some pathway out.
Also, it would be unwise to say aught
of what had taken place to Dorothy's
mother. Mr. Harley and Dorothy would
keep it secret from both Mrs. Hanway-
Harley and Senator Hanway. Storrl
would not broach the subject to Mrs.
Hanway-Harley; he could not without re
vealing more than he desired known.
"Nor will the rascal do more," ob
served Mr. Harley, with the hope of add
ing to the fortitude of Dorothy, "than
come here now and then to dine or elt an
hour. That is all he will count upon;
and before he seeks anything nearer I'll
have him under my foot as now he has
me under his. When th,at hour comes,"
concluded Mr, Harley. rapping out a sud
den great oath that made Dorothy start
in her frock, "there will be no saving
limits in his favor, rll apply the torch
and burn him like so much refuse off the
earth."
When Mrs. Hanway-Harley endeavored
to break Dorothy to the yoke of her am
bitions concerning Storrl, Dorothy '
sparkled and blazed and wept and did
those divers warlike things that ladies
do when engaged in conflict with each
other. Dorothy, down In her heart, attach
ed no more than a surface importance to -
the efforts of Mrs. Hanway-Harley; and
that was the reason why on those fierce
occasions she only sparkled and blazed
and wept. Now, be it known, what Mr.
Harley told her seared like hot iron;
what he. asked of kindness to Storri and
cruelty to Richard cut like a knife; and
yet there was never tear nor spark to
Ehow throughout. She waited cold and
white and steady. Dorothy was con
vinced of her father's danger without
knowing its cause or what form it might
take; and she filled up with a resolution
to do whatever she could, saving only
the acceptance of Storri and his love, to
buckler him against it. Nor was this
difference which Dorothy made between
Mrs. Hanway-Harley and Mrs. Harley
to be marveled at; for Just as a mother
exerts more Influence over . a son than
would his father, so will a father have
weight with a daughter beyond any that
her mother might possess.
While Dorothy remained firm and brave
as Mr. Harley revealed his troubles and
their remedy, she broke down later when
she found herself in her own room. She
did not call her maid; she must be alone.
What had transpired began to come
over her in such slow fashion that she
was given time to fully feel the ignoble
position into which she had fallen. She
must n. t see the man whom she adored;
she must mcct â with politeness even if
she could not with grace â the man whom
she loathed. To one of Dorothy's spirit
and rineness there dwelt in this an in
famy, a baseness, of which Mr. Harley
with his lucky coarseness of fiber escaped
all notice.
Throwing herself on the bed, Dorothy
burrowed her face in the pillow and gave
her tears their way. It was the happiest
impulse she could have had; when the
tears were dried, and in the calm of
that relief \u25a0which was their afterglow,
she considered what she had to do. Oh!
if only she might have sought her mother
with her sorrow! Dorothy shivered; her
mother was the ally of her enemy. How
Dorothy hated and feared that black
and savage man! What fiend's power
must he possess to thus gain a fearful
mastery over her father! Wh.at could
be his secret tipped with terror? Dor
othy again buried her face as though
she would hide herself from any blasting
chance of Its discovery.
When Dorothy wa# with Mr., Harley
she had been in a maze, a whirl. Wrap
ped in a cloud of fear, she had reached
out blindly through the awful fog of it
and seized upon the dear fact of Rich
ard. By Richard she held on; by Rich
ard she sustained herself. She entertain
ed no Quaking doubts as to his loyalty;
loyal herself, as ever was flower to sun,
to distrust Richard was to doubt the
ground beneath her little feet. In her
innocence, she felt that sublime confi
dence which is the fruit, the sweet pur
pose, of a young girl's earlieEt love.
Dorothy must write Richard a letter;
she must tell him of the sad gap in
their happiness. Yes; she would put him
in possession of the entire story so far
as it was known to her. He owned a
right to hear it. Must his heart be
broken, and he not learn the secret or
know the author of the blow?
When Dorothy was again mistress of
herself, between sobs and tender show
ers she blotted down those words which
were to warn Richard from her side.
His' love, like her own, would go on;
there was to be no final breaking away.
It was faith in a dear day that should
find them reunited which upheld Doro
thy through the ordeal of her letter; her
prayer was that the day might be close
at hand.
Her letter finished, Dorothy, late as
was the hour, sent for Bess; she must
have some one's love, some one's sympa
thy to lean upon. Bess came; and. saying
no more than she was driven to reveal of
her father's helplessness and Storrl's
baleful strength, Dorothy told Bess what
dolorous fate bad overtaken her.
"I've written Richard to go to you,
Bess," whispered Dorothy at the woeful
close. "Have him write me a letter every
day; I shall write one to him. I didn't
promise not to write, you know, only
not to see him. But you must not let
Richard go to Storrl. that above all. Poor
Richard! he Is very fierce, and if he were
to arouse Storrl's anger it would pro
voke, him to some awrul step."
There was a man of robust curiosity
who once suggested that It would prove
entertaining if one were to lift the roofs
off a city as one might the upper crust
off a pie, and then, looking down into
the very bowels of life, . observe what
plots and counterplots, defeats and tri
umphs, loves and hates, pains and pleas
ures, losses and gains, hopes and despairs,
honors and disgraces belonged with the
struggles of everyday humanity. It Is by
no means sure the survey would repay
the cost of making It, and the chances
run heavily that the student would gather
more grief than goou from the lesson.
Proceeding, however, by the hint of con
tradiction furnished above, had ' one, at j
the moment when Storrl was binding Mr.
Harley by fetters wrought from the
metal of Mr. Harley'g own fearful appre
hensions, glanced in upon Richard, he
would have found that worthy young
gentleman seated by his fireside, uooth
ing|himself with tobacco smoke, and rev
eling in thoughts of Dorothy. And the
cogitations of Richard, if written _ down
in words, would have read like this:
"Why should I defer a denouement that
will rejoice them all? Dorothy loves me
âloves me for myself, and for nothing
but myself. Who could have offered deep
er proof of it? \u25a0 Bhe has come to me in
the face of her mother, in the face of
poverty; she is willing to abandon every
thing to become my wife". And if her
mother objectsâ as she uoes oojectâ why
not cure the objection with a trifle of
truth? I am not seeking to make a
conquest of Mrs. Hanway-Harley; that
tremendous ambition does not claim me.
lam not to marry her. \v she thinks, .
or why ehe thinks It, should not be so
Important It is Dorothy whom I love,
Dorothy .who is to be my wifeâ none but
Dorothy. No. I*ll end a faroe which no
longer can defend Its own existence. To-,
morrow I'll seek out ray intended mother
in-law, and make her happy In the only
way I may. I trust the good news may
not kill her!** and Richard put on one of
those grins of cynicism.
In this frame Richard retired to bed and
dreamed of Dorothy. His heart was en
joying a prodigious calm; he would no
longer play at Democrltus; he would fill
Mrs. Hanway-Harley's soul with radi
ance, restrain to what extent he might
his contempt for that radiance and the
reason of It, and with Dorothy on his
arm march away to bliss forever after.
No, he would not have Dorothy to the
altar within the moment following the
enthronement of Mrs. Hanway-Harley' ln
the midst of that splendid happiness he
plotted for her. He was not so precipi
tate. Dorothy should have a voice and a
will In fixing her marriage day; most
young women had. But he would advise
expedition â nay, he would pray . for speed
in the matter of that wedlock; for every
hour that barred him from his loved
one's arms would seem an age.
Thus dreamed Richard. And in the
Irony of fate, even while Richard was
coming to these sage, not to say dell
clous, decisions and giving himself to
these dreams, Storrl was raving, Mr.
Harley was cowering, and Dorothy was
weeping and wn.aig that they must not
meet.
When Richard arose in the morning, the
first object his fond eye caught was that
dear hand-write sprawling all across the
envelope: "Mr. Richard Storms." He
tore it open, and this is what he read:
"Dear One: As I write, my heart is
breaking for us both. If I knew how, I
would soften what I must say. Storrl
has gained some fearful ascendency over
papa. Never have I seen papa look so
gray, and worn and old as when he came
to me. He tells me that his safety, his
life, depends on me. I am not to see you
for a while. He says that if we meet it
will mean his disgraceâ his destruction.
I can't explain; I have only my love for
you, sweetheart, and you must not fall
me now. It will all come right, I feel
sure of that; only you must write me
every day how dear, I am to you, so that
I shall have something to help my cour
age. Go to Bess, and believe me yours
with all my heart's love. D."
Richard read and reread Dorothy's
note. ' He did not ramp off Into a temper;
the first effects of it were to drive the
color out of his face and steal away his
appetite. His eye grew moody, and in the
end angry. Some flame of wrath was kin
dled against poor Dorothy, who was so
readyâ that Is the: way he put It to him
selfâto sacrifice nlm In defense of her
father. But the flame went out, and
never attained either height or intensity
as a flame of repute and standing among
flames. Richard was too normal, too
healthy, too much in love. Besides, Dor
othy's note was warped and polka-dotted
with small round scars where her poor
tears had fallen as she wrote; and with
that the flame of anger was' quenched
by the mere sight of those tear-scars;
and Richard kissed them one by oneâ
the tear-scarsâ and found, when he had
kissed the last one and tnen kissed it
again for love and for luck, that he wor
shiped Dorothy the more for being in
trouble. And now Richard felt a vast
yearning over her as though she were a
child. Had she not fought a gallant war
with her mother "for love of him? Rich
ard was all out swept away on a very
tide of tenderness. He would comply
with Dorothy's request; he would not
press to see her; he would write her
every day; he would love her more pas
sionately than before. Incidentally, he
would go questing Bess.
Richard did not permit himself to dwell
upon Storri. He knew him for the source
of all this poison in his cup. In his then
temper, he put Storrl out of his thought.
He feared that if he considered that Rus
sian too long he would ' be drawn Into
some indiscretion that, while curing noth
ing, might pull down upon Mr. Harley,
and in that way upon Dorothy, the ca
tastrophe that hung over their heads.
There could ba no doubt of the black
measure of that catastrophe, whatever it
might be. Richard, while no mighty ad
mirer of Mr. : Harley, had been enough
in that gentleman's company to realize
that It was more than a common appre
hension which had sent him, limp and
fear-shaken, to. Dorothy begging for de
fense. The longer Richard pondered the
clearer the truth grew that some deadly
chance was pending against Mr. Harley,
and that Storrl held the key which 'might
unlock that chance against him. Until
he understood the trend of affairs, a hos
tile collision with S.orrl would be , the
likeliest method by which disaster might
be Invoked. He must avoid Storri. This
prudence on Richard's part went tremen
dously against the grain, for he was
full of stalwart, primitive Impulses that
moved him to find Storri by every short
est cut and beat him to rags. He must
keep away from Storri. Also, he would
defer those revelations to Mrs. Hanway-
Harley which were to have filled her soul
with that radiance' and made , her. as
ready for Dorothy's marriage with Rich
ard as was Richard himself. Those con ii
fidences could not aid now when It was
Storrl, not Mrs. Hanway-Harley, .who
stood in the way. And they might even
work a harm. Richard went on his road
to Bess, while these thoughts came fly
ing'thick ac twilight bats.
Richard found the blonde sorceress
bending above a flower, and doing some
thing to the flower's advantage with a
pair of scissors. As Bess hung over the
leafy object of her solicitude, -; with \u25a0\u25a0 her
yellow wealth of hair coiled round and
round, she herself looked not ' unlike a
graceful, gaudy chrysanthemum. This
poetic reflection, which would have been
THE/SXN :FRANCISCO SUNDAY GALL..
creditable to Mr. Fopllng, never occurred
to Richard; he was I too full \u25a0; of Dorothy
to â¢ have room for Bess. However,' the
good Bess found* no fault with his loving
preoccupation; she, too, was pensively
thinking on poor Dorothy, and at once
abandoned , the Invalid ' flower to console
and counsel Richard.
"For you see," quoth Bess, as though
a call had been made for \u25a0 the reason of
her Interest in another's love troubles,
"I feel responsible for ' Dorothy. It was
I who told you to love i her." ; ,
This was not quite true, and ) gave too
much blame or creditâ whichever you will
âto Bess; but Richard made no objec
tions, and permitted Bess to â¢ define her .
position as best pleased her. :
Bess laid out Richard's programme as â¢
though she were his mother or his guar
dian; . she told him what his conduct
should be. He must write Dorothy a
daily letter: there ought to be a world of
love In it,' Bess thought, in view of those
conditions of present distress which sur
rounded Dorothy. .
"Her lot," observed Bess, "Is much
harder than . yours, you - know!"
Richard, being selfish, did not know;
but he was for ' no dispute with Bess
and kept his want of knowledge to him
self. Yes; Richard was to write Doro
thy every day; and she. for â¢ her sweet
part, was likewise to write Richard every
day. The good Bess, like an angel turn
ed postman, would manage the exchange
of tender missives.
Bess said nothing about Storri' \u25a0 com
ing visits to the Harley house or that
he would insist on seeing Dorothy; She
and Dorothy had been of one mind on
that point of ticklish diplomacy. The
bare notion of . Storri meeting Dorothy
would send tne fiery lover Into a fury
whereof the end could be only feared,
not guessed. Richard was to be told noth
ing beyond the present Impossibility of
meeting Dorothy.
"And most of all," said Bess to Rich
ard warnlngly, "you are not to involve
yourself with Storrl. Remember, should
you and he have differences upon which
the gossips can take hold, there will be
a perfect scandal, and Dorothy the cen
tral figure."
Richard was horrified at Bess' picture.
"And so," concluded Bess, "you must
do exactly as Dorothy requests. â¢ Have a
little patience and a deal of love, and tne
cloud, be sure, will pass away."
"While I am having jatience and love,
I would give my left hand if I might
bring that cobra Storri to account," said
Kichard.
What was written concerning the
mouths of babes and sucklings? Mr.
Fopllng sat with Bess and Richard while
they considered those above-related , ways
and means of interrupted love. Mr.'Fop
ling was experiencing an uncommon ele
vanon of spirits; for he' had. stared Ajax
out of countenanceâ a notable I featâ and
sent the rival favorite growling and
bristling from the room. Usually Mr.
Fopling took no part in what conversa
tions raged around him; it was the rea
son of some surprise, therefore, 'to both
Bess and Richard . when, at the mention
of Storri's name, Mr. Fopllng's ears
pricked up a flicker of interest and he
betrayed symptoms of being . about \u25a0' to
speak. _ '
"Stow-wyl" exclaimed Mr. Fopllng
thoughtfully, as though identifying that
nobleman, while Bess and Richard looked
on as folk do who ba*hold a miracle,
"Stow-wy! I say, Stawms, why don't
you go Into Wall street and bweak the
beggah? He's always gambling, don't' y*.
know!; Bweak him; that's the way to,
punish a fellah.'.'.? [i ",
, "Why! what a . malicious soul ; y<m
have grown!" cried Bess in astbnishmerw.
"Really, Algy" â Mr. \u25a0 Fcpllng's name wis 1
Algernon â "if you burst on 'vs 'in this
guise often, I for one. shall stand. int er-;.
ror of you!"
"But, weally," protested Mr. Fopling,
"if you want to get even with a fellah,
Bess, just bweak him! It's simply awful,"
they say, for a chap' to be bwoke. As
for this Stow-wy, if Stawms hasn't got"
the money to go aftah him, I'll 'let him
have some of mine. You see, Bess," con
cluded Mr. Fcpling, with a broad' candor
that proved his love, "I hate this cwea
ture Stow-wy."
"Why?" asked Richard, somewhat in
terested in his unexpected ally.
VHe spoke dewlslvely of me," and with
that Mr. Fopling lapsed.
Richard /went slowly homeward, his
chin on his chest/ not in discouragement,
but thought. The counsel of the vacuous
Mr. Fopling followed him to ring In his
ears like words of guidance. \u0084 \u25a0
"Bweak, him!" squeaked Mr. Fopling,
feebly vicious. .
Since Mr. Fopling had never been
known to think anything or say any
thing anterior to this singular outburst,
the conclusion forced itself upon Richard
that Mr. Fopllng was inspired. Nor could
Richard put Mr. Fopling and his violent
advice out of his head.
"Money is the villain's hearfs-blood!"
thought. Richard. "I'm inclined to con
clude that Fopling is right. If I take his
money from him he is helplessâ a viper
without its fangs, a bear with its back
broken!"
. Richardput in that evening in his own
apartments. Had you been there .to
watch his face, you would have been
struck by the capacity for hate and love
and thought displayed in the lowering
brow and brooding eye. Richard smoked
and considered; at eight o'clock he rang
for Mr.' Gwynn.
That precise gentleman of stiffness and
English Immobility appeared, clothed in
extreme \u25a0 evening dress, and established
himself, ramrod-like, in' a customary
spot in the: center of the floor. There
was a figure on the Persian rug whereon
Mr. Gwynn never failed to take position.
Once In , place, eye as expressionless as
the eye of a fish, Mr. Gwynn would wait
In dead silence, for Richard to speak.
Mr. Gwynn . had occupied his wonted
spot on the" rug two minutes, before Rich
ard came out of his", reverie. ..Turning to
Mr. Gwynn, he addressed, him through
murky wreaths.
\u25a0 "I shall go to .New York, to-morrow."
"Very good, sir,", said Mr. Gwynn, and
his back creaked in Just the specter of a
bow. ' i \u25a0 '.' ; : - '/ â¢â¢ : , 1. . ; . ;
"When are the president and . general
attorney of the Anaconda to be here?".
"Tuesday, sir; the eighth of the month."
VI shall return before \u25a0 that time."
','Very good, sir!" and Mr. Gwynn again
approved the utterances of Richard with
a creaky mandarin inclination of the head
and. shoulders. \u25a0
':.:\u25a0. "They will arrive on the eighth. Say
to them that they must remain until the
fifteenth, one" week. On Thursdayâ the
tenthâ you " will give a dinner in honor
of Senator Hanway; it is to be fifty
covers. The Anaconda ". people | will come.
I'll furnish you the completed list of
guests when I get back."
"Very good, sir." .
"You \u25a0 may, go." ,
"Yes, sir; you are very kind, sir;" and
the -austere Mr. Gwynn creaked himself
out * /' .
Richard, was left with : his thoughts,
while the silent Matzai, ;: who had heard
the word New. York, began packing. what
trunks were , needed \u25a0; for the journey. _ \u25a0
Storri' was ruthlessly: eager to "get some
taste of his great triumph; and came that
same ; evening to the Harley house. Sen-
ator Hanway had been detained by a
night session, and ' the quartetâ Dorothy,
Mr. Harley, Mrs. Hanway-Harley/ and
Storrlâ sat together at dinner. Dorothy,
pale and still and chill,' was like a girlish
Image made of snow. There was a queer
look of fright and shame and horror all
in one" about her virgin eyes. ' How she
got ; through the dinner- she could not
have told, and only her 'love for her
father held her up.
Mr. Harley was In no- livelier case;
and, albeit he drank much â¢ more j than
usual, the wine put no color in his muddy
cheek nor did it cure I its flabblness. To
sit at his own table and - tremble j before
his own : guest c might ' have wasted the
spirits of even' a j hardier : man than Mr.
Harley.
" Dorothy was In agonyâ a kind of
despair of .shame, eating nothing, say
ing less, and this attracted the shallow
attention of Mrs. Hanway-Harley.
"What makes you so gloomy, Dor
othy?" she asked. Mrs. Hanway-Harley
was In most cheerful feather. A noble
man at her table, ; and though for the
fortieth time, was ever fresh and delight
ful to Mrs. Hanway-Harley: "You are
not ill?" Then, with arch politeness to
Storri, \u25a0 "She has been out of sorts all
day. Count, and given us all the blues,
I was delighted when you came In to
cheer us up."
"It Is to my great honor, madam," re
sponded Storrl, smiling and fixing
Dorothy with that beady glance which
serpents keep for what linnets they mean
to fascinate and . swallow, ' "it Is te my
great honor, madam,' that you say so. I
shall tell my Czar of your charming
goodness to his Storri. If I might only
think that the bewitching Miss Dorothy
was also glad, I should be in heaven!
Truly, It would make a paradise; ah, yes,
why not!".
As Storrl threw off this languishing
speech, Dorothy j could feel his eyes like
points of hateful fire piercing her
satirically. It taught her vaguely, even
through the torture her soul was under
going, that composite sentiment of pas
sion and cruelty felt for her by this
Tartar in evening; dress who mixed
sneer with compliment in all he
said. Dorothy could have ; shrieked out
in the mere torment of it, and only the
sight of Mr. Harley, broken and hope
less and helpless, and old, gave her
strength and courage to refrain.
Storrl departed on the heels of dinner
to the profound regret of Mrs. Hanway-
Harley,* who pressed him to remain. The
Russian was wise; he must not attempt
too much. Dorothy should have respite
for a week. Â« In seven days he would
again take dinner with the Harleys. Dor
othy would have employed those seven
days In thinking on the perils- to her
father which he, Storrl, could launch;
she would have considered how he, Storrl,
'must be courted and flattered and finally
loved to insure her father's safety. It
was victory as It stood. Was he not
compelling the proud Dorothy to receive
his compliments, his glances, his sighs,
his love? Was not Richard, the detest
able, excluded, and the Harley door
cluscd fast in bis face? Ah! Storri would
Impress upon these little people the ter
rors of him whom they had affronted!
He would cause them to mourn In bltter
nessthe day they heard first his name!
Storri, iii mldswing of ail these com
forting ruminations, felt a light hand on
hio 'arm. He was sauntering leisurely
alonn.the street at the time," and had not
journeyed a block from the Harley house.
Stcrri started at the touch and wheeled.
\u25a0 "What' " he exclaimed, "is it you, my
Sari Reve? And what fetched you out N
so: cold an evening?"
1 Storrl.' attempted a manner, of light and
confident assurance. Somehow,' he did
not' altcgcther; attain it; a sharp- ear
would.have caught the false note in hl3
tones which told of an uneasiness he was
trying to conceal. ?J .
That one whom Storri addressed as San
Reve and who, following the touch that
startled Storri, hadtaken his arm, was a
weman. In the dark of the winter even-
Ing nothing could be known of her, save
that she was above a middle height.
. '"Y-is; it is I, Sara," said the woman.
In a pure contralto. "Come with me to
night, Storrl: I have not seen you for
four days."
"We are pleasantly meO" cried Storri,
still affecting an acquiescent gayety.
"And is it not strange? I was on my
way to your fond, sweet 'presence, my
San Reve. Yes, your Storri was flying
to ycu even now!"
All of .which were lies, being leaf and
stalk of that uneasiness which rang so
falsely in 'his voice and manner. Still, if
Mademoiselle San Revo took notice of his
slpslricerity,' she kept the fact to herself.
Storri drew her hand further within his
arm, and the two walked slowly onward,
while . the street' lamps a 9 they passed
merged and separated and again merged
\u25a0'and; separated their shadows as though
the. pair were agreeing and disagreeing
in endless alternation.
Richard, the next day, de
parted for New York as he
had planned. Sending Matzai and h'.s lug
gage to the hotel, Richard on his arrival
drove straight from the station to Thirty,
Broad. , He glanced at a card as he en
tered the' elevator.
"Tenths floor!", was his word to the
resplendent functionary in gold and blue
who presided in the elevator.
"Tenth floor!"" cried the resplendent
functionary In the sing-song of a seaman
taking, soundings' and calling the marks,
and. the elevator came to a kind of bounc
ing atop. - ;.".\u25a0\u25a0 â¢.. \u25a0"-\u25a0:'. - ': '\u25a0' ;'â¢ :
"Mr. Bayard?*' inquired Richard..
"Second door to th' left," sang the, blue
and golden one; then the iron door
clashed and the cage flew on.
Richard | entered . a reception room, and
from this outer harbor, like a newly
arrived ship sending up . a signal, he
dispatched his card . to Mr. Baynard.
Under "Mr. Richard Storms',' he wrote
\u25a0 the words, "son of the late Mr. Dudley
Storms.",. ...--â¢''\u25a0 \u25a0-.\u25a0â¢.;.'.â¢ . .
' The stealthy, whispering Individual, who
spoke with a hiss and scrutinized Richard
as^he took his card. with a jealous Inten
sity, which, might have distinguished a
hawk in. a. state of half alarm and whole
suspicion, presently returned. .His air
was altered to one of confidence.
"You .are to' come in, please!" he hissed
.like a respectful shake.'-
It was. two. hours later, five : o'clock,
when Richard emerged from; that private
room of Mr. Baynard's. Taking the.car
riage "which had he returned "to
the station and caught a train for, Wash
ington. A message went to, Matzai noti
fying that Mongol of what. changes had
, been determined on in the destinies of
himself arid. the luggage. % .. .
- It was the following : morning at the
hour of eight. . Richard v called for Mr.
Gwynn. When that severe personage had
. taken: his; proper (station on the rug, he
rolled : his . piscatorial eye on Richard as
though, inviting notice. -The latter young
gentleman was improving, himself , with
coffee, now and then pausing to thought
fully glance over a roll of names.

Anaconda stock?"; demanded Richard,
still > contemplating the : names.
"Common, two hundred and eleven; pre
ferred, â¢ two ; hundred arid seventeen, sir."
and; Mr. Gwynn creaked by way of end
ing the sentence. "
"Here are. the keys to my boxes in the
Colonial Trust. Here also are the names of

as I have outlined."
"Very Kood, sir; you are rery kind, sir,*
creaked Mr. Gwvnn.
CHAPTER XIII.
How the San Reve Gave Storrl
Warning;. -
Had you, at the time Richard visited
that gentleman, written Mr. Bayard a
letter, you -would have addressed it to Mr.
Robert Lance Bayard, and any- one who
saw you do it would have gazed in wonder
and respect to think you were upon terms
of personal correspondence with that
blinding meteor of speculation. Mr. Bay
ard sat in his rooms at Thirty. Broad, like
an astrologer In his tower cell: he con
sidered the stars and cast the horoscopes
of companies. That done, he took profit
able advantage of his pmscienca.
In the kingdom of stocks Mr. Bayard's
position was unique. He, like Napoleon,
was without a model and without a
shadow. He constructed no corporations,
shoved no companies from shore; he stood
at the ticker and took his money off the
tape. "Whenever he won a dollar he had
risked a dollar.
In person Mr. Bayard was slim, elegant,
thoroughbred, with blood as red and pure
of strain as the blood -of a racing
horse. To see him was to realize
tho silk and steel whereof he was
compounded. There was vanity about
him, too; but it was a regal
vanity, as though a king were vain.
His brow was full and grave, his face
dignified, his eye thoughtful, and he
knew men in the dark by feel of bark,
as woodmen know a tree. He stepped
about with a high carriage of the head,
as might one who has prides well
founded. His health was even, his
nerves were trj^e; he owned a military
courage that remained cool with vic
tory, steady with defeat. It was these
which rendered Mr. Bayard the Bourse
force men accounted him and compelled
consideration even ftom. folk most
powerful whenever they would float an
enterprise or foray a field of stocks.
Did Olf or Sugar or Ste^l come into the
street with purpose of revenge or profit.
Its first care was a peace treaty with
Mr. Bayard. That Tas not because Oil
or Steel or Sugar loved him, but because
it feared him. The King might not. hunt
in Sherwood without permission of
Robin Hood, nor, Montrose walk In
Glenfruin wanting the MacGregor's
consent.
In his youth â that is to say, almost
a third of a pentury away â Mr. Bay
ard had been of open, frank and gener
ous impulse. He believed in humanity
and relied upon his friends. Mr. Bay
ard at 60 was changed from that pose
of 30 years before. He was cold and
distant and serene in a cloud-capped
way of ice. He trusted no one but him
self, took no man's word save his own,
was self-reliant to the point of bitter
ness and rife of proud suspicions. Also,
he had carried concealment to the plane
of art, and those who knew him best
were most in the dark concerning him.
And yet Mr. Bayard made a specialty
of verbal truth and his word was a
word of gold.
It was not that Mr. Bayard deceived
men, he allowed them to deceive them
selves. They watched and they listen
ed, and in the last they learned, com
monly at the cost of a graping wound in
their bank balances, that what they
thought they saw they did not see. and
what they were sure they heard they
did not hear; that from the beginning:
they had been the victims of self-con
structed delusions and were cast away
by errors all their own. Once burned,
twice wise, and the paradox crept upon
Wall and Broad streets, as mosses creep
upon stones, that the more one knew of
Mr. Bayard the less one was aware of.
The feeling was expressed by a gentle
man rich in exchange exrerlence when
he said:
"If I were to meet him in Broadway,
I wouldn't believe It."
And that experienced one spoke well.
For as the tiger, striped black and gold.
Is made to match and blend with the
sun-slashed shadows of the jungle
through which he hunts hi 3 prey,
so was Mr. Bayard invisible in
that speculation whereof he crouched,
a most formidable, factor, with
this to add to the long-yjothed
peril of It. that, although always in
sight, he was never more unseeji than
at trie moment of his spring.
The change from faith and friendship
and a genial warmth that had - taken
place In Mr. Bayard and left him their
rock-hound ppposites had its origin In
the treachery of a friend. Mr. Bayard
those years before was, In his stock sail
ing, beaten upon by a sudden squall of
treason and lying ingratitude; his na
ture was capsized, | and those softer and
more generous graces were spilled out.
They went to the bottom, as things gold
en will; and they, never came up. Mr.
Bayard was betrayed by one who had
taken ''his hand in friendship not the
hour before â one who was his' partner
in business and had risen through his fa
vor. Struck in the dark, Mr. Bayard
stood at the ticker and watched his for
tune of eight millions bleed away; when
he dropped the tape he was two millions
worse than bankrupt. It was that case
hardening experience which had worked
the callous metamorphosis. "
. "It has taught me caution." was all
he said as the quotations chattered off
the loss of his last dollar. â¢
From that hour of . night and- worm
wood,", Mr, Bayard was another indlvld
uaj. He gave men his acquaintance, but
not his faith; he listened and never be
lieved; he had allies, not friends, and
the limits of his, confidence In a man
were the limits ,<St that man's interests.
And yet in this arctic hardness there
remained one generous spot. There was
ono name to retain a sweetness and a
perfume of Mr. Bayard that one finds
in flowers, and the perishing years had
not withered It on the hillsides of His
regard. When Mr. Bayard went down
on that day of storm and the dark waters
of defeat and bankruptcy closed above
him, there had been stretched one hand
to save. Dudley Storms was hardly
known to Mr. Bayard, for the former was
of your silent, retiring men whom no one
discovers .until the time of need. His
sort was evidenced on this occasion, xi
did not. send to Mr. Bayard, he came,. He
told him by shortest . possible sentences
that his fortune was at his Mr. Bayard's
disposal, to put him again upon his feet.
And Mr. Bayard availed himself of the
aid thus proffered; he regained his feet;
he repaid Dudley Storms; and , then : he
went onâ and no more slips or treason-
founded setbacksâ to pile up new mil
lions for himself.
â¢Following that one visit of succor from
Dudley Storms, he and Mr. Bayard were
no oftener in one another's company than
before. The former retreated into his
former reticence and the fastness of his
own multitudinous affairs, cQI?lc QI ? ln S Â£Â°
more to Mr. Bayard, who did not require
help. Dudley Storms was a lake of nre
in a rim of ice. as somebody Â»omewheÂ«
one said of some one else, and labored
under peculiarities of temperament ana
trait-contradictions which you may have
observed In Richard. For his \u25a0Me. . Mr
Bayard, proudly sensitive, while he never
forgot, never failed tofeel to the edge of
that saving favor done him by
Storms the edge of a sword: and tms
served to hold him aloof from one who
any hour might have had his life and for
tune, without a question, to do with as
he would.
â¢ Richard had never met Mr. Bayard, nor
did he know aught of that gentleman s
long-ago disasters, for they occurred In
the year of Richard's birth. But he had
heard his father speak of Mr. Bayard In
terms of glowing praise; wherefore, when
it became Richard's turn to know some
what the Ins and outs of Wall street, a
dark interior trade-region of which hla
Ignorance for depth was like unto the
depth of the ocean, and as wide, our
young gentleman went Instantly In search
of him. Had he beheld the softened aye
of Mr. Bayard when that â¢war-lord of thÂ«
street first read his card, had hÂ« heard
his voice as he repeated the line "son of
the late Mr. Dudley Storms." he might
have been encouraged in a notion that he
had not rapped at the wrong door. But
Richard, in the anteroom awaiting the
return of that person of the serpent hiss,
did not witness these phenomena. When
he was shown into the presence of Mr.
Bayard, he saw only one who for dignity
and courteous poise seemed the superior
brother of the best-finished, gentleman he
had ever met.
"So you are the son of Dudley Storms,"
said Mr. Bayard, running his eye over
the visitor as though looking for a con
firmatory resemblance. Then, having
concluded his scrutiny: "You are like
him. Have a chair: tell me what I can
do to serve you." - '.%'\u25a0'
Richard was taken with Mr. Bayard's
words, for that gentleman managed to
put Into them a reassuring emphasis that
was from nowhere save thÂ© heart. Thus
led, Richard began by asking Mr. Bayard
If he knew aught of Storrl.
"Storrl? He is the Russian who helped
the sugar people get their hold in Odessa.
The oil Interests have some thought of
employing him in their affairs. What
of Storrl?"
Richard explained the propriety of de
stroying Storri; this he did with an in
genuous ferocity that caused Mr. Bayard
to smile.
"The man." observed Richard In con
clusion, "is no more than so much ver
min. He is a menace to ray friends: he
has intrigued villainously against me. I
have no option; I must destroy him out
of my path as I would any footpad or
any brigand."
Being primal In his instincts, as every
great man is, Mr. Bayard, at this hostile
declaration, could not avoid a quick side
glance at Richard's door-wide shoulders.
Pict arms, and panther build. Richard
caught the look.
"Oh, If it might have been settled In
that way," cried he, "I should have had
his head wrung round ere this!" â¢
"You will readily conceive," observed
Mr. Bayard, after musing a bit. "that
I keep myself posted concerning the
least movement of the' least man who
comes speculating; into stocks. You
may take it for granted that I know a
trifle or so of your Count Storrl. To be
frank, he and Mr. Harley. with Senator
Hanway and five others, are preparing 1
for some movement in Northern Con
solidated. I don't know whether it is
to be a 'bull* or a 'bear' movement, or
when they will begin. Those are mat
ters which rest heavily on the finding
of that special committee of which
Senator Hanway Is the chief. Do you
know when the finding may be looked
for? Can you tell me what the com
mittee will report?"
Richard could not bring: himself to
speak of Senator Â«Hanway's confidential
assurances of a white report for North
ern Consolidated. From those assur
ances he was sure that the pool raedi
atated a "bull" campaign, but he did
not say so since he could not give his
reasons.
Mr. Bayard came to the protection
of his anxieties.
"Senator Hanway." went on Mr. Bay
ard, "has privately told a number of
people that the report will favor the
road."
Richard was struck by the cool full
ness of Mr. Bayard's information. It
was likewise Impressive to learn that
he was not the only one in Senator
Hanway's confidence. On top of Rich
ard's wonder Mr. Bayard piled another
marvel. 'He declared that he did not
believe the word of Senator Hanway.
"He la a fox for caution," auoth Mr.
Bayard, "and I cannot think he told
the truth. Believe me, the committee's
report will tear Northern Consolidated
to pieces. The market has been ex
ceedingly strong since the beginning
of the year. He will watch and plump
In that adverse report the moment gen
eral prices show a weakness."
Richard, while- taken by the reason
ing of Mr. Bayard, was not convinced.
However, he asked Mr. Bayard what
might be done.
"Remembering always," said Rich
ard, "that the one purpose I have In
view Is the overthrow of Storri."
"Every member of that pool." re
turned Mr. Bayard, "has made himself
fair game. A pool is like a declaration
of war against the world; the pool It
self would tell you so. And speaking
of the pool, you understand that the
eight are bound together like a fagot.
You can't break one without breaking
all; If Storrl fall Mr. Harley. Senator
Hanway and the others fall."
Richard could not forbear a smile
as he recalled how Mrs. Hanway-
Harley had said that her > only
objection to him was his lack, of
riches, and ,how. should his for
tune one day mend and measure up with
Mr. HarUy'3 Dorothy and he might wed.
The peculiar humor of those possibilities
which the situation offered began to ad
dress itself to Richard. Was not here a
chance to remove Mrs. Hanway-Harley'a
objection?
"Since they are open game." saM Rich
ard, "I see no reason why tne whole oc
tagonal combination should not be wiped
out. Indeed, there might be a distinct
advantage in It," he concluded, thinking
Â©n Dorothy.
â¢"There would be a distinct advantage
of several millions in It," returned Mr.
Bayard, who was thinking on dollars and
cents. Then, as might one who, having
decided, takes the first step In a. great en
terprise: "Where, by the way. are those
millions that were left by Dudley
Storms?"
"They are where you may put your
hand upon them." returned Richard, "In
any hunting, of this vermin Storri."

JL before turnin*-out time, and be
'/forthwith kidnaped In the open
streets cj South Shields, every master
mariner within hearing would have put
hlsa Cown contemptuously as a gratuitous
ttar/ .".
'Into .this exclusive chamber Captain
Owen Kettle had made bis way that day
after tea, and over two modest half pints
of bitter boer had done his share in the
talk and the listening, from 8 till 10:33
of the dock. He had exchanged views
with other shipmasters on cargoes, crews.
Insurances, climates, and those other pro
fesslvnal matters which the profane
world (not In the shipping Interest) ands
to dreary; and had been listened to with
deference. He way a man who command'
cd. attention, and though you might not
like what he said* you would not dream
if "refusing- to listen to It
That special night, however, Captain
Kettle's personal views on maritime aX
lalrs were listened to with even more def.
exence than usual. A Urge red-haired
man swung Into the captain's room some
few minutes after Kettle had seated
himeelf, and after ordering bis beverage
and a cigar, nodded with a whimsical
smile in Kettle's direction, and asked
him how he liked the neighborhood of
Valparaiso as a residence.
* Vl* forget." said the little sailor, dryly
Â° enough.
, "AH right, â¢captain," said the red-haired
rna,n", â¢ "flon't you mind me. I never re
member too much myself either. Only
Â£ou did me a good turn out there, al
though you probably don't know it, and
I'd t>Â£ proud If you'd have a drink or a
\u25a0 MTso'icp with me now in remembrance."
Â«*^Vou're very polite, captain."
"jion't mention It, captain," euld the
red-hairvd man, and struck the bell.
.'.'Stme? Half-a-plnt of bitter, please,
nii^.-and one of 3 our best four-penny
smptci." '
Ttte peneral talk of the captains' room,
BrÃjcfaf had halted for the moment, went
on asraln.
â\ sa.lvage point was brought up by
Â«a $tout -.gentleman in the Baltic timber
; tr.adp-who was anxious to air his scnti
rne^ts;'but the red-haired man skillfully
Intervened, and "Kettle on Salvage" was
asked for and heard. And co on all
through the evening. The red-haired man
did his work cleverly, and no one resented
It.
ITow, Kettle was a man who liked be-
Isia; listened to, and there is no doubt
that his vanity was tickled by all this
4>ference from his professional equals.
There- is no doubt also that the smug
security of Hallett's lulled his usual sense
of w<arlnesÃ, which may Jn part account
for -what happened . afterward. And so,
without further excuse for him, it Is my
rafciful duty to record that an hour after
he. left the captains' room the little sailor
was.ee trapped and kidnaped by what to
a man of his knowledge, was one of the
most vulgar of artifices.
He emptied his tumbler, stood up and
said he must be going. The red-haired
man locked at the round cabin clock on
the wall and mentioned that it was his
time also; and together they. went out
side Into the damp, dark main street of
South Shields.
* "Going back to your ship, captain?**
Hsked the big stranger.
' ".Why, no, captain," said Kettle, "I
live fyere. and I'm eft home."
"Then I suppose I must say good night
Hcp'e to meet you again, though. What
boat .are you on now, captain?"
"Well, I'm putting In a bit of a spell
ashore Just now. captain. Fact Is, I
haven't' run across any employment quite
to my taste lately. 'TJsn't every ship
owner I care to serve under."
"No." Bald the red-haired man. "They
* are brutes, most of them. But look here,
captain, there' d be no offense in my get
ting you the refusal of a berth, would
there V
Kettle flushed. "Captain," he said,
"you'ns very good. You see. I'm married
with children, and I've never earned
enough to put anything by. Between
men, I don't mind telling you I'm on my
beam ends. If I can't get hold of an ad
vance note this week. It will mean going
to the pawnshop for Mrs. Kettle's next
Sunday dinner."
Tfce red-haired man sighed. "Well,
captain," he said, "you needn't thank
me. It's Just my duty to my employers
to put this thing In your way. But we'll
not er>eak of It here In the open. Come
along off to niy steamboat"
"Right" Ball Kettle. "Where have you
pot her?"
"She's lying at a buoy in the river. We
can get a boat from the steps."
They got down to the steps and took
a waterman's boat turned up the piece
of plank which lay In the stern sheets
and sat on the dry Bide, and then
pushed off into the dark river. The red
halred man picked up the yoke lines l i
Eteercd the boat amonff the dense ship
ling: past tiers of coasting schooners and
timber droghers and out-of-work clinker
built tugs: past ungainly iron steam
tramps, fishing craft, dredges and the
Â«uher resting traffic of the Tyne; and
finally rounded up under a frieze of
rtcrns, and ran alongside the gangway
of a 200-ton Â«team yacht
."Hullo," said Kettle,, "pleasure?"
* "Well, hardly thatjs Bald the red-haired
man. "Step aboard, "Captain, and I'll pay
off the waterman."
"He'd better wait to- take me ashore
again."
o "No, let him go. We may have a long
talk. I'll put you ashore in one of my
own boats when you go. Now, captain.
here we are. Come below to my room."
"You've got steam op, I see," said
Kettle, gs they walked aft along the
white, wet decks.
"My orders," gald the red-haired man.
"Sail soon?"
\u25a0tMay start any minute. We never know.
My owner's a rare one for changing
mind."
"Huh." eald Kettle, "might be a wom
an."
"Devilish like a woman," said the red
haired man dryly. He opened a door at
the foot of the companlonway and turned
an electric '.igrht switch. "This is my
room, captaiv.. !?trp rlf;'it :r. A drrp i>"
whisky might te a good thing to keep out *
the cold while we talk. Excuse me a
minute while I get a couple of tumblers.
I guess the steward's turned In."
Kettle seated himself on a velvet cov
ered sofa and looked round at the elab
orate fittings of the cabin. "Satlnwood
panels," he commented, "nickel battens
to put the charts on, glass-backed book
case, and silk bunk curtains; no expense
spared anywhere. Lord, who wouldn't
sell a farm and go to sea? But the old
man said she wasn't pleasure! I wonder
what the game is? Contraband, I guess;
many a yachts great on that Well, any
way, I*YÂ» got to hear."
The r*d-h aired man came back with
two half-filled tumblers and a water Jug.
"Here's the poison," said he: "mix It ac
cording to your own weight." .
"That's rather more than my usual
whack," said Kettle, eying the tumbler;
"but It's a cold, wet night, so here'sâ by
the way. captain, I'm afraid I've forgot
ten your name?"
"My name?" said the red-haired man.
"Oh, yesÂ» I'm Douglas, Captain Douglas."
"Captain Douglas." said Kettle,
thoughtfully. "No. I can't say I recall
It at present. Well, sir, any way, here's
your very good health and prosperity."
"Same." said the red-haired man, and
absorbed his whisky and water with the
dexterity of an artist. Out of politeness
Captain Kettle finished his tumbler also;
there Is an etiquette about these mat
ters.
Silence filled the cabin for a minute
or so, broken only by the distant clat
ter of a shovel on a firebar, and Ket
tle looked at the cabin clock. It was
11:80 and Mrs. Kettle would be expect T
Ing him home. "Hullo," he said, "firing
up? Oh, I suppose you've got to keep
steam In the donkey boiler while you're
In the harbor to run your dynamo. By
the way, you were talking: about some
employment you could put in my way,
captain?" he added, suggestively.
"Employment!" said Douglas uneas
ily. "Oh, was I? Employment! Tes,
to be sure. Well, you see, captain, it
was my owner I was speaking for, and
I've been thinking it over and perhaps
on the whole you'd" better see her for
yourself."
"Her!" said Kettle. "Is, there a woman
at the head of this concern?"
"A lady, call her. But look here, cap
tain, you're getting sleepy. Why not turn
In here for the night, and see her your
self In the morning?"
Kettle yawned, and his head nodded.
"I am sleepy and that's a fact, though
I don't know why I should be. But it
wouldn't do for me to turn In here for
the night â¢ Mrs. Kettle's expecting me
at home, and I've never broken word to
her since I was married. I should take
it as kind, captain. If you could give me
come notion about this piece of employ
ment now, bo that I could see whether it's
worthâ" He yawned again, and struggled
with his heavy eyelids. "You must un
derstand, please, captain, that time 13
scarce with me: I must get employment
at once. I can't stand by and see my
missus and youngsters hungry." i
Captain Douglas swore and hit the table
with his fist "It's beastly hard,"- he
said, "and I hate myself for bringing you
here."
"What's that noise overhead?" said
Kettle. "What are your crew doing on
deck?" He tried to rise, but fell back
stupidly on the sofa. A harsh bell
clanged from somewhere beneath, and
the 6lop-slop of water came to him
through the yacht's side.
"She's swinging around in the stream,
and some one's rung 'stand-by' to the
engine-room."
"Sounds like it," the red-haired man
admitted.
Again Kettle tried to rise, and with an
Immense effort tottered to his feet; but
he had been given a drug too powerful
for even his iron will to fight against;
and be swayed, and then pitched help
lessly sideways on to the carpet.
Then the door of the stateroom
creaked slyly open, and the red-haired
man started violently. He turned and
saw a tall, dark woman Just crossing
the threshold. "Donna Clotllde!" he
said nervously. "I thought you were
ashore. Then It was by your ordersâ"
"That the yacht was got under way!
SI, senor, I saw you coming on board
with the man we have been hunting for
these last two years, and as soon as the
pair of you got below I sent word to
the mate to call all hands and get out
of the Tyne as soon as the pilot could
manage It". She knelt beside Kettle's
prostrate body, and passed her
caressingly over his damp forehead.
"You are sure you have not overdone
ltr she asked. ." vV y
"I am sure of nothing ltke'that," he
answered grimly. "But I gave him the
dose you measured out yourself, so
what's done Is your own affair. I only
added enough whisky to drown the
taste, and the poor little beggar drank
it all down at one mouthful."
"I don't see that you need pity him
much. He will be all right when he
wakes." '. w.'"
"When he wakes It will be at sea, and
I have heard him speak of his wife and
kids. That's why I pity him. Donna
Clotllde. Incidentally I'm a bit sorry
for myself." He stooped, over the pros
trate man and took a revolver from the
back pocket of his trousers. "Look
there I You see the fellow took a gun
with him even to Hallett's. It's grown
to be a habit with him. He's a dead
shot, too, and doesn't mind shooting."
"I didn't think you were a coward."
"You know quite well I'm not, senor
ita. But this Captain Kettle will remem
ber that I was the fellow that decoyed
him on board and ' he'll be pretty anx
ious to square up the account when he
wakes."
"You are well paid on purpose to
cover all risks," said the woman with
some contempt
"And I shall be earning my pay," said
the red-haired man doggedly. "This
small person here's a holy terror. Well,
I must be getting on deck to see the
pilot take her down the river. Here,
I'll put him on the bed before I go.
Hell sleep It off more comfortably
there."
"You shall not touch him,"- said
Donna Clotilde. "I will do all that's
needful. I have waited for thi3 moment
for three long years."
"You must be pretty keen on him If
you can sit by him when he does not
know you." ' .
VI, have loved him since the first
moment we met, and he knows it; and
I do not mind who else knows It also.
I am entirely without shame In the
matter; I glory In It. lam not one of
your cold-blooded European women."
"Well." he said, "you are paying me
to run this yaght, and I must go on up
to see the pilot take her out of the
river without ; . -, losing us any paint"
And he went out of his room and left
Donna Clotilde La Touche alone with
this man by whom she was so fiercely
Bttrnrtf-O. " â¢
The voyage was not one of monotony.'
Captain Kettle lay for the first twenty
four hours In a state of snoring uncon
sciousness, and when he did oome to
his wits again found himself In a cabin
alone. He got up and stretched. His
limbs were heavy and languid, but he
was not conscious of having sustained
any hurt He clapped a hand to :\u25a0\u25a0 the
region of his loins and nodded his grim
head significantly. His pistol was
missing.
The time was night: the cold air was
full of moonshine, and fortune favored
him in so ; much that the red-haired
man whom he sought was himself
standing a watch. He walked up to
him without any concealment, | and,
then, swift as light slung out his right
fist, sending every ounce of hit weight
r . -
after It and caught ' the" red-haired
man squarely on the peak of. the Jaw.
The fellow went down as If he had
been pole-axed and Kettle was prompt
ly on top of him." The three other
hands of the watch on deck were com
ing fast to their biff captain's assist
ance and Kettle made the most of hlÂ«
time. He had been brought up in a
school where he was taught to hit hard
and hit first and keep on hitting, and
moreover he 'was anatomically skilled
enough to know where to hit- with
most effeot. He had no time then for.
punctilious fighting; he Intended to
mark his man In return for value re
ceived, and he did it Then the three
lusty deok hands of .the, watch came up
and wrenched him off and held him for
their officer In turn, to take vengeance
on.
Kettle stood in their grip, panting,
and pale, and exultant '
"You great ugly red-polled beggar," he
said, "I've made your face match your
head, but ' you needn't thank , me â¢ for It

hard, bitterly . hard. ,
By ao me subtle 1 transference of thought
the woman in her, berth . below became
conscious of his regard, - grew : restless,
woke, got more restless, dressed, came on
deck , and saw this man with whom she
was so fiercely enamored staring gloomily
over the bulwarks. With her lithe, silent
walk she stepped across the dewy decks
under the moonlight, and, without his
hearing her, leaned, on the rail at his
side and flung \ an ~ arm across his shoul
ders.
Captain Kettle woke from his musings
with a start, stepped coldly aside and sa
luted .formally. He had an eye for^a
good-looking 5 woman, and this one was
dellciously; handsome. ;He was always
chivalrous toward the other sex, what
ever might be their, characters; but the
fact of his own kidnaping- at the moment
of Mrs. Kettle's pressing need made him
almost -as hard las though: a man stood
before him as his enemy.
"Miss , La '\u25a0, Touche," he said, "do you
wish me to remember you with hatred ?"

sheer weight of numbers. He had
cracked one man's forearm In the

smashed In the front teeth of a third,
and they were rather Inclined to treat
him roughly, but the red-haired skipper
came up and by sheer superior strength
picked him up. kicking and- struggling,
and hustled him off below whether hÂ«
liked It or not
The lifeboat dangled half-swamped
from the forward davit tackle and all
hands had to be piped before they
could get her on board again, and by
the time they had completed this Job
there was another matter handy to oc
cupy their attention. A fireman, cams
up from below, white-faced and trem

"The yacht's half full of water," he .
said.
Now that their attention was called
to it, they noticed the sluggish way she
rode the water.
. "She must * have started a plate or
something," the fireman went on ex
citedly. "We've got both bllg* pump*

way to the- companion. Between decks
they could hear the water slopping
about under the flooring. It seemed a
bad. almost a hopeless ease.
Instinctively the red-haired man went
to his own room to pocket hi* valuables,
and by a chance hÂ« was moved to lift op
the door in the floor which covered tha

(Continued oa rase T.)A MODERN HOSPITAL
AWHEEL
CT^ nÂ£ latest Innovation in Western
r% I . railroading Is a hospital car, de-
I ; signed by and constructed under
I the direction of Dr. F. X- Ains
e. i - worrh. chief surgeon of the South
â¢ era Pacific Company.
,lt Is not a hospital car simply In name,
that may.be hurried with surgeons, nurses
ap<s eurjgfcai appliances to the scene of &
wreck or accident, for the purpose of tem
porarily giving succor to the Injured and
sick, but a. hospital car in fact, possessing
all the needs of a modern Institution and
rcsdy for any kind of an emergency alon*
the lines of the big railroad corporation.
'â¢The car la the product of the. Southern
Padflo Company's shops in Sacramento
and has the distinction, which, of course.
Dr. Alnsworth Is proud 'of, of being the
first of Its kind to be added to the rolling
clock Â«f anjr. of the big corporations In
this country. It was constructed along
line* favorable to the better treatment
and comfort of Injured patrons and em
ploye* of the road and has been the sub
ject of general comment throughout the
railroad world for the Ingenious arrange
ment of Its many details.
; While thousands of dollars are being
expended continually by the railroad cor
porations 'on the Improvement of their
medical departments, especially \in the
building of modern hospitals at various
points along their lines, with a view to
decreasing the serious results of exposure
and stiflerlng that naturally attend seri
ous wrecks and accidents to trains. It re
mained for the Southern Pacific "Company
, to Introduce a novel and most valuable
feature In the shape of a hospital car.
* The Idea was conceived months aco by
Dr. Ainsworth, but did not develop Into
definite plans until he had been afforded
opportunity to make a careful study of
the different methods pursued by the rail
reads In this country and abroad In the
handling of. injured persons.
France, it was discovered, had been
using a car for hospital purposes for a
I long time, but an Investigation revealed
the fact that the car was not a satisfac
tory one. -In view of Its many faulty de
tails of 'construction and equipment. It,
however, 'gave Dr. Alnsworth some en
couragement In his ambition to possess a
much needed 'traveling hospital and set
his mind at work evolving plans for a car
that would meet the requirements of the
Far West, where cities and towns are
separated by long ctretches of unpopu
lated lands,, sometimes by mountainous
places, where it is next to an Impossibility
to give prompt attention to the Injuries cf
persons under the railroad conditions that
have Â£xistÂ«td up to the present time.
Heretofore It has been the practice of
, the Southern Pacific and other big rail
road companies to send their Burgeons to
a wreck In an ordinary car, which lacked
many of* the requisites of a hospital.
Often it has been found necessary to per
form operations at the scene of the wreck,
thus, subjecting the. patient to dangerous
exposure, and the lack of other facilities
has natiirally increased the suffering of
those less seriously hurt. Finally the vie
" ilms of the werck have been bundled Into
c Che car and hurried to some Important
6tation cji the line, where their Injuries
received proper attention. The advent of
the new hospital car eliminates much of
tWs former unfortunate experience and
will undoubtedly greatly lessen the seri
ous results, that have frequently followed
the lack of better attention to patrons
of, the roads who have been mixed up in
train wrecks. â¢/.-..;
The car is 76 feet in length and includes
within* its walls an operating or dressing
room, -v drawing-room, that may be read
ily transformed into a ward for the sick
or. injured, 2. private bedroom, with lava
tory, shower bath and lockers for the
use of the surgeon in charge of the car,
an observation room, that can also be
converted into a sleeping apartment, a
well-equipped klfchen and comfortable
quarters for the nurses and servants, a
storage room for stretchers, and lockers
galore for the care of surgical appliances,
medicines and /Iruffs and other necessities
of a hospital. There is also a modern
heating apparatus, a refrigerating plane
end a china closet replete with bright
ware that is used by the Eurgeons and
other occupants.
The servants' quarters and the heat-
Ing apparatus occupy the extreme for
ward uart of the car and just behind
them are the kitchen, pantry and linen
lockers. Next lo the kitchen are two of
tke most important compartments of the
carâ the operating room, and the ward
room.c both of which serve in a dual ca
pacity, the former, when necessary, as a
dining-room ni:d the latter as a draw
ing-room. The dining-room contains an
elegant jable and buffet sideboard with
Â«â¢ locker below and chairs of attractive de
eign. -In the "drawing-room, when tt is
being* used as a place of leisure, are
several big easy chairs, giving It the ap
pearance*. cf a comfortable living room
on one o a f the fashionable yachtst in the
East.
tvhen the compartment Is turned over
to the use of sick or Injured the chairs
"are stored beneath the car. In specially
fcrranged" boxes; the carpet also disap
pears, and by means of a mechanical
device the sleeping berths are ele
vated" into position and the curtains
swung for the protection of the patients.
The* berth raising mechanism is an inno

A lobbies. - - Phrases like these pass
from lip to lipâ "a good deal," "a paying

so on. And if we could hear what peo
ple think as well a* say we should be
even more certain that the thought of
most grown men and women and even
<3l the rising generation Is largely occu
pied with plans and processes of money
getting. Professor William James of
Harvard, that acute psychologist, has
said that there is nothing which the
average American fears so much as pov
erty. And the way in which men strive

money, and to get still more money con

first half of his life in getting all the
money he can and the second half try-
Ing to prevent others from getting it

chanical device, which is controlled^by
Eastern patents.

beneath the car floor in dust-proof cases.
When accommodations are needed for a
patient a portable crank is applied to a
sunken shaft in the center of the floor
by one of the attendants and a few turns
of the crank brings the upper berth Into
view. It can be hastily elevated jto its
proper position, near the ceiling or made
stationary at any height above the floor..
In this way. the handling of a patient,
who may be suffering from extreme pain,
is greatly facilitated. If two berths are
needed the .turning of the crank is con
tinued until the second or lower berth
is in position. Then tne attendants draw
an iron frame from the wall ' of the car
above the berths . and to it adjust the
berth curtains, which are so . constructed
as to protect the patient from any pos
sible draught and at" the same time af

tageous purpose or other, a fact that
soon becomes noticeable to a visitor.

conditions, that necessarily have to be
avoided in a car of this character.
Mahogany finish prevails throughout
the car. except in the kitchen and
'front end. which are in natural oak,
and the rear compartment, which has
a finish of weathered oak. The car Is
lighted by Plntsch gas and Is wired for
electric lighting, which will be fur
nished through the medium of a train
dynamo or by an axle generating ap
paratus. Heating pipes extend through
out its Interior and a fresh, water sup
ply is obtained from overhead tanks.
The total weight of the car Is 122.500
pounds, of which 41,000 pounds belong
to the two six-wheel trucks upon
which it is mounted. v
Great care was taken In tha con
struction of the car with a view of In
suring: its easy riding, s,o that patients)
who may have to be transported Ions;
distances will . not suffer unnecessary
discomfort. Shortly after leaving the
Sacramento shops it was given an ex
traordinary . run to Chicago, where It
was sidetracked to permit It to bÂ« In
spected by the members of tho Ameri
can Railway Association, who wer* la
convention there.
On this run the car proved its thor
ough adaptability to the purposes for
which It was built. In so far as easy
riding and strength of construction are
concerned, and since then it has made
several long trip 3. the latest to the
southern end of the Western system
of the Southern Pacific Company's line,
whither it was dispatched by Dr. Alns
worth to bring north several Injured
persons.
The Introduction of the new hospital
car on the Southern Pacific Company's
lines Is to be followed by the con
struction of several more but less elab
orate cars for similar purposes. They
will not be built with the observation
compartment and some of the other
luxuries of Dr. Alnsworth's car. for the
latter was designed with the Idea "of
not only serving in cases of emergen
cies, but as a private car for the chief
surgeon when It is necessary for him
to travel over the divisions of the
road. The new cars, however, will be
as fully equipped with surgical appli
ances and medicines as the present car.
The company's lines extend over such
an unusually large . territory that It has
been often a difficult matter to reach the
scene of an accident or wreck as expe
dltlously as the medical department would
wish. It was this annoying fact that first
suggested to Dr. Ainsworth tho need of
hospital cars, that could be assigned to
divisions and proceed to a wreck imme
diately on receipt of the tlrst call for a.<Â»
slstance. His plans appealed strongly to
the good judgment of the management cX
the road and- ended In the authorization
for the construction of the magnificent
car recently turned out by the company's
most skilled mechanics in the Sacramento
shops.
Months of constant studying and travel
ing were consumed by Dr. Alnsworth be
fore he was ready to submit to the com
pany's draughtsmen his plans for a car.
and even after the latter had been de
signed and Its superstructure started
many changes In the original plans were
made In order to conform with the latest
', Ideas of the chief surgeon. Among the
' many surgeons who have inspected the
hospital car the consensus of opinion is
that there Is little room for improvement
on No. 119.
Until the other hospital cars are ready
for service this car will have its head
quarters on a, side track in the railroad
yards at Third and Townsend streets,
where it will be ready for a call at any
hour of the day or night. Its crew of
nurses, cooks and porters will remain by
it constantly, and all that will be neces
sary to. start it on its mission of mercy
to a scene of disaster will be to connect
it to a baggage car and locomotive and
give It Its signal to pull out of the com
pany's yards.
"While Dr. Alnsworth has been directing
the construction of the hospital car he
has also been devoting a great deal of at
tention to a plan for establishing along
thÂ» lines of the company modernly
equipped emergency hospitals, such as
have been already* designed for West
Oakland, Bakersfield. Truckee, Dunsmulr,
Sparks and Indio. In the event of big
train wrecks or accidents these hospitals
will be made a receiving place for the
more seriously Injured. The latter will be
conveyejd- to the emergency hospitals in
the newly equipped cars, and when their
injuries will permit the patients will then
be transferred to the big hospital In this
city or to the branch hospitals on other
divisions of the system.
Dr. Alnswonh's plan for a hospital car
is expected to be adopted soon by the of
ficials t>t the Union Pacific and other sys
tems in which the influence of E. H. Har
i!man dominates, and also by the o.ther

In a ' recent achievement, witnessed
by. and attested to by a number of well
! known nwdical people of San Francisco,
this young scientist, who was compara
tively Unknown five years ago, sees the
damning oÂ£ one of his life's ambitions
and t lie- â¢ possible revolutionizing of
many of the-iheories of physiology.
Two weeks ago a little party of In

Emma A. Lewis, who has long been as
sociated -with the former in his sclcn
tiac experiments. Dr. H. W. Hunsaker,
Dr. A. U. Nelson. Dr. 'W. - A. ' Wheelah,

ties and :::a<2e a report on the results of
the day's work, and Dr. Atkins' assist
ants, Miss Wilson end Miss Adelaide
Hanscoxnb. met by appointment at
fifth and Market streets and jour
neyed over to the slaughter pens In
Butcherto^ra on a mission, the success
of which has since provoked wide
spread comment in the scientific world.
The object of this mission was to de
torxnlne by a thorough experiment, for
which Dr. Atkins had been making
ctref u! preparations for several weeks,
tow and. ln what manner the life forces
.act, from an electrical standpoint. The
.test was made upon the brain of a 11 v
' lag Texas steer, carefully selected from
a band- cf the sturdy animals by the
slaughtermen. The experiment was
simple ln.lts detail, lasting less than flf
.. teea minutes, during which Captain
Wildman, stationed at a galvanometer,
ope hundred feet beyond the scene of
â¢ operation, carefully recorded the de
'fiectioos of, that extremely sensitive
" Qiaclzlns.
, The steer, which was destined for
j ordinary slaughter, died In the Interest
Cf science, and as it lay upon the
bearfiefl floor of the slaughter pen,
tightly fettered and lashed, its brain,
pulsating under two electrodes, that
\u25a0were connected with the distant
galvanometer, it furnished the needed
material- for the scientific research of
23x. Atkins and his Interested com
panions.
No batteries were used In the ex
periment, a small Insulated copper wire
connecting the specially prepared
platinum electrodes directly with the
galvanometer one hundred feet away.
Wtten the electrodes were Inserted Into
the lobes cf the steer's brain tbe gal
vanometer registered a deflection of
seven points, but within a minute's
tfcae this reoord was changed to four
points. This change, according to
fo.pts.ln Wildmtn, under ' whose per
sonal supervision the galvanometer
was candled, may have been due to
two causes; a temperature effect,
caused by the Insertion of the cold
electrodes Into tbe animal's brain, or
'to the mental excitement of the steer
wbea the Instruments were put Into
his brain. At any rate Captain Wild
ir.tn. In a report be has made on the
result of the experiment, that Is, as to
the electrical phase of the affair, says
tbat whatever the causes may be, the
tact remains tbat a current, sufficient
ly strong to create a deflection of four
points In the galvanometer, continued
= tor six minutes while the steer lay
' quietly on tbe pen floor, free from the
' JSrst ,m,ental excitement.
' , * A second experiment was made when
the .steer's throat was cut. Then the
deflections registered at nineteen points
slid continued to fall until the elec
trodes'were removed at the end of five
&nd a half minutes after the animal's
throat- was cut. Captain Wlldman
notes the variations that followed the
putting of the steer's throat and at
" tributes them to the final struggle of
Jhe i>east. With the needle of the
galvanometer In its normal position
"**ne. electrodes were next placed In the
blood of the steer that had been re
ceived In a wooden bucket and again
the needle became agitated. From these
cesults^Dr. Atkins deducts that the
brain is Itself a battery; that Its own
electrical force was responsible for the
<def. eciion on the galvanometer, and
{hat. the blood of the animal, also
charged -with electricity, was responsi
ble to the final movements of the
ifeedle.
And Captain Wlldman, speaking only
jls an experienced electrician, says:
thing, however. Is proven. In
\u25a0The living animal there exists a differ
ence in potential between two points
in the brain, which difference In po
tential would cause a certain amount
of electrical current to pass between

THEORIES
those points. When, the animal is killed
by bleeding to death -'this difference
in potential ceases, and with it the
electrical current."
Five years of hard work on the part of
Dr. Atkins and Dr.. Emma Lewis, who
has rendered him valuable assistance and
offered the young scientist a world of en
couragement when the more skeptical
members of his profession were inclined
to scoff at his theories, have finally been
rewarded with the reEUlts of this recent
experiment. During those* five years Dr.
Atkins made experiments. on other classes
of animals to demonstrate that electrical
currents are generated in the living lungs
every time that- '--a* new breath i of oxygen
is drawn, in 'from, the atmosphere, and he
has also proven by. experiment .with ; the
living stcmach of a healthy man that
there exists within the walls of. that or
gan a direct current of .electrical energy.
He has found the same force registered in
all other living organs, and this fact, ; to
gether with the results of his recent test
upon the brain of \u25a0 the Texas â¢ steer/ at
Butchertown, further strengthens . j the
conclusions he has-been nourishing for
monthsâ that the life principle Is elec
trical in Its action. -â¢'â¢â¢ '
"The fact that we ha^ found a differ
ence in potential between the different
portions of the brain," insists DV-, Atkins,
as he interestingly enters Into a discus- \u25a0
sion of his theories and - conclusions,
"proves practically that the whole brain
works upon the electrteal plan and is un^ '
doubtedly the great center of eleotrloal
activity within the living organism." â¢ j
The brain being: charged with eltctrto
energy, says the doctor, is the causa of
all the sense organs responding to the
external waves of. force or stimuli. . For
instance, the ear Is sensitive to the sound
waves, the. eye Is : sensitive to the light
waves and all other organs of sense re
spond to various forces when charged
with electrical . forces of life, upon /.the
same plan as the telephone or the tele
graph. The doctor likens the living brain
to the receiver of the wireless telegraphy
system in responding to the waves of
universal' thought. \u0084 ;
Pursuing his discussion along these
lines, he pictures the brain as the great
central office of the whole living system,'
connected ' throughout all its Intricate
mechanism by delicate nerve cella' and
nerve wires, which are ' so constructed aa
to throw the currents into different wave
lengths and thus produce all the differ
ences of action in the body.
He. takes the emphatic stand that this
law of action in wave lengths and rate of
vibration Is tbe key to all the mystery of
action In the human body. He goes fur
ther by Insisting that it Is the key to the
sublime mysterlca of the universe, and
furnishes the scientific world a sugges
tion on the broad field of Investigation by
a statement that when the brain is
charged with the electrical life principle
It may become In tune* with the vibra
tions of the universal ether and catch
from It the wireless messages of thought.
Therein he finds a possible scientific ex
planation of Buch conditions as telepathy
and clairvoyance, which, in his opinion,
are only higher vibrations and greater
sensitiveness of normal action in the or
ganism, and in no wise supernatural. .1

.: That afternoon Kettle contrived to set
the yacht afire In three \u25a0 separate places
and' a good deal of damage was dona (and
night thad' fallen again) before the seared
crew managed to> extinguish the flames j
and this time Donna Clotilde Intervened.
She asked, for Kettle's parole that he
would â¢ attempt \u25a0no further mischief; and
when thlÃ was flatly refused, incontinent
ly put him in Irons. The lady: was some
what tigerish in- her -affections.
. -When the yacht passed the straits
she bad four days' more coal on board
and the executive (and. Kettle) expect
ed that she would go Into Gibraltar
and lay alongside a hulk to rebunker.
But Donna Clotilde had other notions.
She had the' yacht run down the Mo
rocco coast and brought to an anchor.
So long, as \u25a0 she \u25a0 had Captain Kettle In
her company upon the waters she did
not vastly care whether she was mov
ing or at a standstill.
"You cannot' escape me here," she
said to him when the cable had roared
from* the hawae pipe and the dandy
steamer had swung to a rest. "The
yacht is victualed for a year and I can
stay here as long as you choose. You
had far better be philosophical and
give In. Marry me now and liking will
come afterward." ' >'J
Kettle looked at the tigerish love and
resentment which flashed from her black
eyes and answered with cold politeness
that time. would show what- happened;
though, .to tell: the truth. Indomitable
though he, was as a general thing, he was
at that time feeling that escape was al
most impossible. And so for the while he
more cr less resigned himself to captiv
ity.- ?; .-:â¢... . . ' ; \u25a0
' But others, It seems, 'besides those al
ready mentioned in this narrative were
taking a lively Interest In the smart
yacht and her people. She was at an
chor In the bay of the Riff coast, and the
gentry who Inhabited the beach villages,
(and the villages In the hills behind the
f beach,- had always looked upon -anybody
and anything they could grab as their
just , and lawful prey. The, Sultan of
Morocco,. the warships of Franca, Spain
and. elsewhere .and the emissaries of
other powers had time after time en
deavored to school them In the science
'of civilisation, without effect, and ao they
1 still remain to-dajr. the only regularly
practicing pirates in the western world.
1 The yacht was sighted first from the
hills, was reported to the beach vil
lages, and waa reconnoltered under
cover of night by a tiny, fishing boat.
The report waa pleasing and tha word \u25a0
went round. , Bearded brown man col
lected at *an appointed spot, taoh â¢ with
the anna to which -he was beat accus
tomed, and when darkness fell
four large boats were run down to the
) feather edge of the surf. There was
\no indecent hurry. They ... did' their
work . with .method and carefulness,
like men who are used to it, and they
arrived: alongside "the yacht at 8 a.m.
confidently expecting to take her by
surprise. . :. ;
..The "\u25a0 yacht's â¢ low freeboard made
but a small . obstacle to a climber
from the large, boats alongside, and
neither the deckhands nor the stock
hold cre.w were any of them trained
flghtingmen. In. their prentice hands
the' kicking revolvers' threw high, 'and
were only useful as knuckledusters, and
till they had 'thrown them down and
got their . cutlasses Into play they did
hardly any execution to speak about.*
The Riff men, 'on the other hand, had
been bred and born In an atmosphere
of skirmish; and made ground steadily.
At ' an early point of tha scuffle. Cap
tain Kettle came on' deck with a cigar
in his mouth and hands In "his pockets,
and looked on \u25a0 upon .matters , with -. a
critical interest,- but did not offer to in
terfere one .way or -the other. .It was
quite \u25a0 a new . sensation ; to him,' to watch
an actlve_flght without being . called
upon to assist or arbitrate.
And thin upxame from below Donna
Clotilde iLa LTouche, dressed and wea
poned, and, without a' bit of hesitation,
flung, herself into the turmoil. She saw
Kettle standing on one side, but neither
besought r nor. commanded him.'. She
would ; have died sooner than - ask for
his help then ; and be met with refusal.

Through earth's forests, vines ' and

example and the fury of her rush ani

stronger to drive the wall of their as

came quickly. An evil smelling man
noted her glorious beauty- and marked "
her out as his special loot. He clapped,
a couple -of sinewy arsis around he?
and bore her away toward the tool*
warks, and his boat. -
Some one had switched on the electrfa
deck lights, and the fight waa In a glow
of radiance, everything was to be clear
ly seen. Donna Clotilda waa being drag
ged resisting along the decks, and Kettle
looked on placidly smoking hla cigar. She
was heaved up on the bulwarks: In an
other moment she would be gone from his)
path forever. .
Still her lips made no sound. - though
her great, black eyes were full of wild
entreaty.. But the eyes were. more than
Kettle could stand. Ha stooped and pick
ed- up a weapon from among the litter on
deck and rushed forward and \ gave a
blow, and the Rlfflan dropped limply, and
Donna Clotilde stood by the yacht's' bul

"Now you get away below," he â¢ or
dered curtly. "I'll soon clear this rabble
over the side." â¢ \u25a0
He watched to see her obey him. and â¢
she did It meekly. Then ' he gave his i
attention to the fight. He broke a packet
of cartridges which lay on the deck
planks, picked up and loaded a revolver
and commenced to make himself useful to
the yacht's crew, and from that moment -
the fortune of the battle turned.
"Hump yourselves, you lazy dogs!"
Kettle shouted. "Keep them on the
move. Drive them over the bows. Mur
der those you can reach. Am I to do all
this Job myself? Come on. you mon
grels." .
Captain Kettle was on the top of the
deck house, which served as a navigat
ing bridge, ostentatiously closing up the
breech of the revolver after 'reloading It.
He wished for a hearing/and after what
they had seen of his- deadly marksman
ahfp, they gave it to him without demur.
Hla needs ware simple. He wanted steam
aa . soon aa tbe engineers could give 'It
him, and he intended ta take the yacht
Into Gibraltar right away. Had anybody
an objection to raise?
The red-haired man made hlznself

"You can leave that to mo safely," .
said Captain Kettle. "It will be some

*The men dispersed about their duties.
the decks were hosed down and the deck
lights switched off. After awhile Donna
â¢ Clotilde came gliding up out of >the dark

top of the . deckhouse. Kettle regarded
her uneasily.
To his surprise she knelt down, took
hij hand and smothered It with burn
"inf kisses. When she went back to tha
head of the ladder. "My dear." she said,
"I will never see you again. I made you
hate me. and yet you saved ray life. I
wish I thought I. could- ever forget you."
"Miss. La Toucbe." said Kettle, "you
will find a man in your own station one
of these days to make you a proper hus

this cruise and think "how lucky It was

f\ I Francisco to act as host of one
1 .y' who but for a. turn of for
.\Â»* â¢ tune's wheel might have owned
half the land on which the
town is built ,_
Such a guest is with us now, how
ever, in the person- of Julio M. Llm
antour ot Mexico.
â¬ Hi* is a pleasure trip, he tells me,
taken for the benefit of two young
sons who accompany him and who had
not before been in this part of the
United States.
But the/ know the country, yes, in
deed, and intimately, for, as the
ytfunger says, with a comprehensive
gesture, they "have had a lot of trouble
with California."
It It has been your good fortune to
live In this city by the sea for the last
half century, or your pleasure to delve
into the history of the State, you know
of the Llmantour claim.
It dates back to the- early day when
men made tain by:
"The rood old rule, the simple plan Â«
that they should take who have the
power-Bed they should keep who can."
In its practical operation this "sim
ple plan" laid up many an intricate
problem In land titles for the courts
of a. later period to solve.
cAccordlnr to papers filed before the
Board of Land Commissioners In 1853,
Captain Joseph Ives Llmantour. citi
zen of Trance, had supplied the Mexi
can army bo acceptably with money
and munitions of war that Manuel
Mlcheltorena, Governor of the Cali
fornia*, In token of his Government's
cppVeciation. granted him about half
of tJifs peninsula, together with . the
Â« Farallon Islands, Alcatraz and Yerba
â¢ Buena.
Truly a grant of kingly munificence
even so long ago as 1843. and by the
time It was sought to be enforced ten
years later Its value had increased a
thousand fold, so that the finding of
.the United States District Court that
the claim. v.as not satisfactorily authen
ticated lost to Captain Limantour and
his descendants a goodly heritage.
â¢ And this is v.-hat the boy mean*
when he says, with a wide sweep of
his .arm, "We have had much trouble
with California."
His father, son of the original claim
ant, neds his acquiescence, adding:
"Eiit that wes long ago and needs not
now tie mentioned."
Plainly he is not going to para
phrase the Selkirk soliloquy by re
minding himself he might be monarch
of all be surveys if his right there'd
I been none to dispute. He has promi
nent place in the industrial upbuilding
of Mexico (being interested In mines,
railways and agriculture) even as his
brother Jose, the present Minister of
Finance, is a leading figure in the
country's civic regeneration, and new
duties born of ever new occasions
probably leave small room for regrets.
"When Americans inquire about
Mexico they always mean business,"
says Mr. Limantour, unconscious of the
idiom, "and," he continues, "never Avere
there such splendid opportunities as
now. Great improvements are planned
or under way and all lines of trade are
prospering. Some American merchants 1
have not won success in my country
because they want to get rich quick.
When they find it a slow, steady pro
cess there as everywhere, they get dis
couraged and quit " But when dealers
have understood Mexico and the peo
ple they have made more money than
they could ' In the same way in the
same time In the United States, bo I
think.
"Mexico has suffered much in your
esteem because many of your citizens
have lost money in mines or planta
tions there. But is that Mexico's
fault? I have seen plans and charts
of mines that never existed, descrip
tions of places that never were. Whefti
Americans put money Into such busi
ness of course it la gone, but we should
not be blamed. The promoters, are
rarely or never my countrymen.
"If the projects are honest and the
investors careful there will be profits
for all! ''\u25a0:â¢>
"In all the great railroads or canals
or wharves built our Government is
directly Interested and the American
engineers who have done some of our
best work could not ask more favorable
conditions."
"The Tehuantepeo Railroad?" I In
quire.
"What a splenu.~ thing is will be
when the terminal harbors are com
pleted! At Salina Cruz," on the Pacific,
the Government is really constructing
a port. Two great breakwaters are*
built In such a way that an entrance
of about 1000 feet Is left between the
points. This gateway admits to an
outer harbor In which vessels; may lie
to unload in fair weather. At the back
of this outer harbor Is the great sea
wall, twenty feet wide on top, on which
will run trains to carry the freight to
the city proper and to connect with the â¢
regular line across the isthmus
"In this sea wall there 'is an opening
only 300 fee"t wide so that the inner
basin thus made Is perfectly sheltered I
and vessels there 'anchored will be al
ways safe. â¢ - '
"Besides all this, the low swamp :
lands along the shore .are being
dredged out and filled in so the place:
will be free from fevers.
"At first it was thought ten millions
would complete the harbor, but novrthe
Government plans to devote about"
THE NEW OLD MEXICO
eighteen million dollars to the Improve
merits , ' - â¢ \ * *
"All steamships in the Pacific: Coast
trade regularly visit Salina Cruz, but V
when the' port is finished this business !
will greatly increase. For 1906 250,000
tons of sugar from the Hawaiian Isl
ands are already contracted for trans-,
portation over the Tehuantepec Rail- ,
road.
"Coatzacoalcos, which means Tempi*,
of the Snake, the Atlantic harbor for
the road, is also being improved .under
Government direction, and soon It will
be possible for vessels to discharge
their "cargoes directly on the wharves
Instead of transferring to lighters." ,
"Why Temple of the Snake?" I ask.
"The natives had there a great
temple* to their deity, and when the
Spanish came they tore It down and
used the material In building a fort'
Long afterward the fort " was likewise
demolished and its stones were used In
the houses for the workmen' engaged'
in building the railway."
I "So those rocks know all" of Mexico's
history from the earliest day?"
"Yes, but .we can't learn It from
them. One of our most Interesting
ports is Manzanillo, . on the Pacific, If
its history is considered.*; 'It Is about
600 miles south of Mazatlan and 'lies
due west of Mexico City. , Four hun
dred years ago the great Spanish gal
leons'entered and left this .harbor in
their explorations and trading: expedi

THE SAN FRANCISCO SUNDAY:
By Mable Beeson.
Long ago a narrow gauge railway
was" built . from ' Manzanillo to Colima.
It was 'to, be 'the". first.. section of n
transcontinental line/ but' the \u25a0 'money
gave _but â¢ and only this piece was fin-*
lshed. .So, because thwe' was no- rail
way from eastward, | travelers
had to walk or. ride oh burros the sixty,
miles .from' that city "to â¢ Tuxpan, where
theyJ could* take the Mexican Central
trains. *-. \ â¢'..'â¢ \u25a0 ' ';'â¢..\u25a0 '_' .
'.'Many times it was intended to connect
Tuxpan and j Colima and thus complete
.the -line, i but the s difficulties were ,' too
great, andUsojthe old Spanish road , re
mained the only route over, the distance.
"Now. the railroad Is being built, and in
its forty^five-mile lengthâ for it is' shorter
;than< tbe;old .trailâ there will be , thirteen
tunnels, and twelve bridges," from' which
you may, know , the character â¢of the coun
try there. .An American engineer is doing
this big, work after many others caid it
was impossible.' : ;
"One of;the surprising results of , the
large contracts for work of this kind ' Is
the ability shown v by the nativesâ the In
dians. -.Where they are - righ tly maftaged
they have proVed' very capable; and many
of them have; made really fine engineers.

I should be to enjoy perfect health,

never having known the misery of a

malignant demon, who fastens his fangs
In the nerve-centers and racks the brain
until the victim is almost exhausted.
1 once said to a girl friend: "Tell me,
Blanche, what is the worst thing about
a headache?" She answered: "It is all
worst. There is the boring of a cork
screw, the grinding of a coffee mill, the
creaking of a buzz-saw and the pound-
Ing of a triphammer, all combined, when
I have one of my headaches. It is a day
coming on in which I am wretched, it has
a day of endurance when I am more

When a girl has persistent headaches
and can assign no reason for them, she
had been crowred with success that Cal
fornia was urging Congress tq^ admit her
into the Union. A bill to recognize her as
a State was being bitterly opposed in
Washington, where the feeling -between
the pro-slavery faction and the abolition
ists was most pronounced, and, realizing
the need of a representation of forceful
men at the national capital to further the
interests of the ambitious State, a dele
gation, among whom was the late Gen
eral Bidwell, was chosen to proceed to
the East and make a fight for California's
admission.
Just prior to his departure. General
Bid well was approached by Crosby with
a recuest that he meet his wife and
daughter in New York and arrange for
their long trip to San Francisco. This.
General Bidwell did when he reached the
East, and having fulfilled this mission he
and his associates proceeded on to Wash
ington, where they entered into the- fight
for the California statehood bill, which,
at that time, had received some very dis
couraging blows from the slave Stata
representatives in Congress, and had been
practically pigeonholed by the Senate,
where the bitterest of opposition to its
adoption had been shown. The Califor
nians were deeply dismayed by the situa
tion, and finally decided to return to San
Francisco to await a better opportunity
to press their claim.
Returning to New York General Bid
well visited Mrs. Crosby and her daugh
ter to advise them of his early departure
for the West. During the conversation
the general referred to the poor chances
of California receivirfg favorable recogni
tion from the Thirty-first Congress, and
incidentally remarked that one of the
strongest opponents to the measure in the
Senate was supposed to be Senator Sew
ard of New York, the former Governor of
that State.
With Seward's opposition to the bill Gen
eral Bidwell expressed the belief that it
could not be passed until a new Congress
had convened. Mrs. Crosby, suddenly ad-
should visit an oculist. A great many
headaches come from strabismus, or un
equal sight. If the nerves of the eyes
are strained there is almost certainly the
probability that headache will follow. I
have known headaches entirely vanqui.sh
eU by the simple recourse to a doctor
who prescribed, the proper glasses. No
girl shcuid ever run any risk by selecting
her own lens in such a case. A visit to a
trustworthy specialist is Indisptnsable
and will save time, money and strength
In the end, for here a headache 13 mere
ly a warning signal of danger.
A headache often springs from a dis
ordered stomach. The fatal habit, of
munching and nibbling between meals,
or the appetite for rich pastry too free
ly indulged, or the pcnchanU for candy,
that bane oÂ£ schoolgirl existence, ' may
account for thÂ« rebellious stomach.
When the stomach goes on a strike there
quickly follows the nightmare known as
sick headache. If- girls would carefully
limit their eating of candies and sweet
meats to a somewhat meager dessert,
after a meal of plain food, these dainties
would do them little harm. But there
arc girls who fairly gormandize on bon
bons and sweets. I could tell you tales
uf girls with pasty, salraw complexions
and red, angry looking pimples and very
cross dispositions, entirely due in my'
opinion to their excessive eating of can
dy and other confectionery. In its place,
pure candy injures no one. but it was
never meant to be a steady diet. It is
rather by the way of being a sort of
reward of merit and a crown to a little
feast. The trouble Is that over-eating
of sweets surfeits appetite. and then one
does not care for roast . beef and mutton
chops and rice pudding and baked apples
and other admirable articles of food,
which give one good red blood, and. build
one up in wholesome vigor.
If your mother has been wise she has
not permitted her schoolgirl daughter "to
taste either coffee or tea during her child
hood. These beverages should be the sole
consolation of grown-up people, who may
be supposed to understand the uses of a
stimulant. A growing gk- should not
drink a* cup ;of \u25a0 coffee . or a cup of - tea
under any : circumstances. If she . wants
a warm drink for breakfast on a cold
morning, let it be either cocoa or hot
vancing toward General Bidwell, asked,
as a peculiar smile illuminated her f ea- '
tures:/
"Yoji don't mean, general, that your
fears for the bill center around any pos
sible action on the part of Senator. Sew
ard?"
"Yes, madam," responded the general,
"and If I could be assured of the friend
ship of the Senator from your. State, I
would feel certain that our bill would be
passed before the close of the-present ses
sion." k
Mrs.. Crosby and Senator: Seward had
been schoolmates, and had grown up as
neighbors in the name towni and she felt
milk, both of which are nutritious and
innocuous. If you wish \u25a0 to keep bright
eyes and red cheeks and to . feel buoy
ant and well, Jet tea and coffee alone
until you are long past school days. But
drink an abundance of cold water.
A fruitful cause of headaches is con
stipation. Unless the physical system
be regular and the body periodically re
lieved of rubbish. and debris, no one can
hope to be well. Girls sometimes neglect
this important rule of nature, particu
larly If they are away I from home, or if
they have not established . in themselves
a definite and inflexible , order about the
matter. One can never neglect the pe
riodicity of nature, A girl who would be
boiu beautiful and well must attend to
the necessary drainage of the body, In its
every form.
Another caution may be pardoned
by the ambitious girl , who goes to school
who wants to keep up with her classes/
and , who Jongs -to . take ', a high . rank in
the studies she prefers. Do not work too
late at night. The beauty sleep cornea bo

Days of struggling between the oppos

1850, President Fillmore affixed his signa

A few days afterward saw the Califor
nia party. Including Mrs! Crosby and her
daughter, departing from New York on
their way to the Isthmus, exuberant with
Joy over the success -of their mission to
Washington. Prior to leaving New York
General Bidwell had suggested to Mrs.
Crosby and hec. daughter the advisabil
ity of securing heavier clothing In antici
pation of the rainy weather they were
likely to encounter on the isthmus trip,
and with that good judgment that women
generally show in preparing for a long
trip the Crosbys had purchased two um
brellas, little imagining the Importance
that "was to be later attached to one of
them.
.Immediately after their embarkation
General BidwelL had turned over to Mrs.
Crosby the various official documents re

been received by him in Washington.- be

over to the charge of Miss Crosby by her
mother and remained in her custody until
they were finally placed In the hands of

later.
Night after night on the way down the
Atlantic coast these papers reposed un

seven days and nights in an open -boat
along the Chagres River was undertaken
and. the heavy rains of the tropics were
encountered, Miss Crosby bravely sacri
ficed her. own comfort to shield the pa
pers from the wet by secreting them in
the folds of her silk umbrella, which
was never raised to shelter her head from
the downpour. In this strange receptacle
the papers remained during the tedious
ride on mule back across the isthmus
to Panama, where the Californlans board,

On the vpyage up the coast the Call
fornlans agreed that the honor of being
the first to land from the steamer and
to transfer the valuable papers to the
proper authorities rightfully belonged
to Miss Crosby as a reward for her
faithful care of the documents. The
ship was made spank and clean and, at

Bidwell and his party were returning
with good news. There could be only
one bit of good news for those in San
Francisco, and that was that California
had been granted by Congress her
statehood. In ten minutes' time the
rapidly growing city was in a state of
great excitement, which increased as
the -Oregon, with her guns loudly
booming, steamed up the harbor *vnd
anchored off the main portion of San
Francisco.
Thousands of people greeted the first
boat par^y to land, and the connrma
tion of the news that California had
rinally been admitted to tha Union as a
State was a signal for renewed bursts
of enthusiasm. Business came to a
standstill and the populace save way to
its Joyous feelings and continued the
Impromptu celebration into the night.
Meanwhile, arrangements had been
made for a formal celebration on Octo
ber 29, when a parade through the
principal -streets by all the publics
bodies was followed by a gathering on
the N plaza, where the Supreme Court
Justice. Nathaniel Bennett, delivered an
oration and other exercises were per
formed. In the evening; the city waa
again a scene of excitement. The more
fashionable people attended a grand
ball, others congregated In the public
resorts and cheered and drank to the
success of the new State, and thou
sands paraded up and down the main
thoroughfares and shouted as the skies
were illuminated by the fireworks and
bonfires on Telegraph Hill and Rincon
Point.
It Is little to be wondered that the
woman, now in her seventy-fifth year,
can so clearly remember the incidents
of that notable occasion, for she was
a prominent figure in them. But great
er good fortune was In store for the
then pretty Miss Crosby. It was not
long after that she became the wife
of Major S. Jay Hensley, who had
journeyed to California in the early
40's. He participated In the Bear Flas
affair and was afterward stationed at
Sutter Fort, when John Marshall took
from the sluices at Sutter Mill the first
gold found, in California. It is an old
story of tÂ«e historians how Marshall
sent the gold to Sutter Fort to be test
ed by a young army officer who en
joyed a fair knowledge of chemistry,
and that the latter pronounced the
nuggets to be pure gold. That young
officer was Major Hensley. who secured
a portion of the newly discovered gold,
which later formed the wedding ring
placed on the finger of his bride.
The ring Is still worn by Mrs.
Hensley and on the occasion of her re
cent meeting with Mr. Filcher In Ore
gon she proudly exhibited it to him
and related the story connected with
it. ; The* Interesting tradition attached
to It prompted the suggestion by Mr.
Filcher that Mr 3. Hensley provide a
codicil to her will bequeathing the
ring to California with the understand
ing that It be placed among the relics
in old Sutter Fort. This she promised
to do, and expressed her pleasure at
the thought that the rins will event
ually return to a place with which her
husband's name is so closely associated,
in history.
Before the gold ring is given a place*

In Sutter Fort the old silken umbrella,
which la now in the custody of Mr.
Fllcher at the Palace Hotel, will hava

a deserved mention In the report of the

a tyranny which assails children who
have been wickedly alarmed by nur3ea

that dangers of every kind lurk behind

well to go to a safer place. \

to be afraid to cross the continent or tha

to the realm of physical courage.
Now^l want ' to speak about a higher
kind of courage. There are brave peo
ple who never shrink from danger that
menaces the body, but who are moral
cowards. They are afraid to speak the
truth If the truth will injure themselves.
They are afraid to endure anxiety about
their loved ones. They hide from their

Youthful lines in the back, particularly
at the waist line where the broadening is
first apparent, depend almost entirely
upon good carriage. When the back
broadens the woman may be sure that her
chest is sinking in, and her carriage Is
sloppy. Eetter than an exercise prescribed
for certain hours of the day is the Invari
able habit of standing correctly. This
means that the abdomen must make a
straight line down the front and the hlpa
must protrude at the back. The woman
whose back is broadening will find that
her first efforts to stand correctly will re
sult in a sensation of stiffness in the calf
of the leg, but this will last only a short

thing that you do yourself; if any one
else had done it it would have been
an unspeakable daub, all of which
shows the value of words properly ap
plied.
The chief drawback to th* perform
ance of a great literary feat of the sort
that our friend William 'contemplated Is
the fact that It IS necessary to live while
the stunt Is being done. It's not only a
very natural prejudice in favor of stay-

urably familiar as long as possible, but
It Is also a neoesiity arising from th*
nature of the case. Dead men tell no

It was his* idea that rubbing elbows

would also aoQuire a large library,
which he could dispose of at the sec

nearer to 1 the great heart . of humanity
than ; he .was when ; dallying with a type
writer and a paper cutter! in the official
book reviewer's cubby-hole. # \u25a0
William was dead right about - getting
next to the great heart of humanity. In
fact, he was so impressed with its pulsa
tions that before long he came to the con
clusion that beating Is the principal busi
ness of the human race. He also learned
that reporting prize < fights, interviewing
ward politicians and shady actresses and
working up murder cases were not exactly
csiculated to develop the higher life. His
ideals were being gradually taken : away
from him, although he was unable to see
that they were passing into the possession
and this year they are of tortoise shell,
set with tiny Jewels.
The invisible net is much used, but
it must be adjusted "with "the hand of
an expert, or the coiffure looks like a
wig. It costs not less than twenty
five cents and is easily torn. Infinite
care must also be taken that dandruff
does not attach itself to the fine mesh,
especially when the hair Is dark.
Only very young girls wear ribbons
on the t hair and these must be
Immaculately fresh. Even the slightest
powdering of dandruff on a dark bow
gives the effect of slovenliness.
Women wear ribbon at the nape of the
neck; when riding horseback, but at no
other time.
A drooping collar at the back of the
neck Is most unsightly. No woman
should wear a high collar without some
sort of support, either featherbone or
the new celluloid collar supports, which
look like toothpicks and can be in
serted Instantly into the collar of even
a wash waist. They can be bad for
10 cents a set at any notion counter.
Fancy safety pins or tiny Jeweled
bars have replaced buttons or hooks
for fastening collars in the back, but
they should be used in matching sets
and a larger bar in the same design
should be used for the belt. Three or
four styles of fancy pins down the
back of a costume look most Incon
gruous.

BY AUGUSTA PRESCOTT.
NEW YORK. December 23.
IT has taken ten authoritative Vien
nese dressmakers, ten London tailors
and a whole nation of French dress
makers to prepare the styles for 1900.
The result .Is something startling
even to the world of fashion and to those
accustomed to Its changes.
The part -which America has taken in
the char.ro is onÂ« of much interest, for
It is a part as that cf a epecialist. The
American hatter, the American shirt waist
, tnaker and' â¢ the American bootmaker
stand tisjQue in the world with none
like them. Nineteen hundred and six
Is to be &. year of specialties and the
ftsbiccs are- to be divided.
From Paris â¢ will corns the dress hat*
and the evening gowns.
Vienna- will create the reception gowns
and the dressy little negligees, the 6
o^dock tea gowns and the more elegant
of the modes.
1 Front London will come the tailor
mafias, Ihe smart walking suits, ths
handsosno Scottish plaid tramping dresses,
and the wonderful . tailored resturant
â¢ towns. ' â¢
' 'Axaeriear.s will lay claim to originating
\u25a0ths pretty shoes, the neat sailor hats with
S their variations and tha shirt waists, all
r etsfctly distinctive, and it also claims the
honor of providing the prettiest girdles in
the world.
London pats in another claim of fashion
by volunteering to furnish the automobile
styles. It stands for the heavy, bulky
coats acd^the great Russian garment
which wrap the automobllist from head
Â° to foot *
When starting off with the fashions of
1906 one might as well mention the choic
est morsel of news first of aIL And this
iScContained in a paragraph clipped from
a gossipy paper in a corner of the Conti
nent. It runs as followB:
"Fraulein Bertha Krupp will visit
London this spring for a protracted
time, where she will formally make
her o <*ebut in society, chaperoned by a
lady who stands high in court circles.
The c Fraulein will be presented at
court, "and It Is rumored that a wealthy
c International engagement is planned
for her. Fraulein Krupp, who is the
rj chest girl in â¢ the world, having In
herited can" annual Income- from the
Krup? gunmakers of over a million,
is now fully grown and Is as beautiful
Â« k 'type of German as one would wish,
to see.* She Is of the pure Rhine type
and her favorite colors are white, pur
ple, lavender and hello."
This paragraph, while it might not
mean much to the casual reader, means
a world 'of things to the London tailor,
D for it Big-nines that he- is to have a
large order from the wealthiest girl
In tfie world and that if he executes
hfs commission well other orders will
follow, .for all the world flocks after
a wealthy glrL
B . _ Mica XCropp la Society.
Miss Krupp's spring suit is a tailor-
Tr.afle gown of stunning 1 black broad
cloth, with a high gloss to it It is
made with a wide skirt with tha new
habit back â a revival of the old habit
back â and this skirt Is trimmed with
braid.
The manner of trimming the skirt Is
peculiar. The braid is put on in great
squares around the hips In something
that resembles the Greek key design.
Throughout the braid there runs a lit
tle tracery of hello-colored silk and
there are tiny loops of hello-colored
ribbon at each side of the braid. There
is a very smart hand-embroidered
hello-covered LouLslne- shirt waist cov
ered with hand work and down the
front are tiny purple enamel buttons
painted with violets.
The coat is an Eton, double-breast
ed, pointed in front, trimmed with
hello-colored braid and underneath Is
a very wide girdle elaborately em
broidered. This Is the suit which Is
worn by the greatest heiress In the
world.
One of her smartest spring dresses
will be in pansy-colored canvas, which
is cs thin as voile and looks very.
much like It It is made over a cam
bric skirt of exactly the same color
and under this Is a pansy-colored taf
feta petticoat, all frills. It Is the very,
smart thins; to carry one color
throughout the wardrobe, dressing in
It cfrom the crown of the head right
to the sole of the foot. literally as well
as figuratively.
olt is a fad of Miss Krupp to have
everything to match, and one of her vio
let sets embraces forty articles of wesj>
ing apparel, all In violet and all worn at
the same time. Altogether they made a
lovely costume. One article is a fan and
another Is an embroidered fan ribbon.
Then there are shoes and stockings*
gaiterettes, girdle, reticule, stock, em
broidered veil, etc., with all the large*
things that go to make up a fashionable
costume.*
Moil Fashionable Women tn Society.
"""Who are the most fashionable women
in society?" This Is a question which is
asked very frequently at the beginning
o* the yj-ar, for It is now that the styles
ere formed and It is now that the real
leafier? of fashion step forth in some sort
cf supremacy.
JuÂ£tÂ«afÂ° the moment the most correct
styles are worn by two leaders, one of
whom IsEingle and the other among the
y matrons.* These two women, widely dif
ferent yet much alike in style, are Mrs.
John Jacob Astor and Miss Alice Roose
velt The former selects her gowns with
i economy. She Is dressed "closely," as
they cay In Paris, but with great ele
gupg*- Shegeta good money value for
her dollar and knows how to buy so as
to bring out the styles well. â¢
Miss Roosevelt, on the other hand,
dresses mopt extravagantly. A young
woman of large private fortune, and with
another fortune coming to her from her
Boston relatives, she can dress as she
pleases without considering the coat Her
clothes are elegant and refined, but a lit
tle too costly for the average person to
follow. Her fondness . for Alice blue la
very pronounced.
"I would advise you to oopy the' gowns
of Miss Roosevelt," said a modiste. "But
the trouble la their expense. I do not
refer to their flrst cost, but to the cost
of keeping them up.
"Take her light Alice blue cloth dress,
with its hat, its beautiful gloves, Its
gaiter tops and all other things to matoh,
even to Its wrist bag and Its Jewelry.
What other woman could afford It?
"And suppose she could afford It? Sup
pose that by dint of much management
she contrived to get together the gown,
the hat with Its long plume, the hand
embrolflered veil with its little gauze face
veil, the gloves and the girdle, whyâ what
next? Why, the cleaning, of course.
"Every one knows that these things
coll readily and that they must be fre
quently cleaned, and It is the cleaning:
which costs rood money. To keep suoh
a costume In good condition provided
It be worn as often as three times a
week, means a constant outlay of
money. And that Is why Alice blue
and its friend companion, tan color,
are costly to maintain. It i'a not so.
much the first cost* as the replenish
ing."
A Leader With a Fijjure.
It is said that the Philadelphia wom
an is the only woman in the- world
who can keep her figure. Taught
Quakerish habits in her youth, she
learns how to preserve her shape. Her
waist line does not spread. She has
little of the wide, belted characteristics
of the Gothamlte and*, not even a sea
son of Gotham" feasting plumps her out
Her figure remains 6lim. Mrs. John
Jacob Astor, who was once a Phila
delphia girl, looks trim this season.
The styles are specially built for her;
they are long, slim, trim and "fit."
Her* arÂ« some of her sjowns: Bh*
wears a dress of black and coral pink,
combined In the most artful ways.
There is very little of the pink, . Just
a touch of It !i ere and there. With this
she -wears coral Jewelry; and the most
beautiful tri-cornered hat,. bent up here
and there and fastened with coral
choux. This is exceedingly * becoming
and what is more: desirable* for a
matron to considerâ it Is youthful In
its lines. And youthfulness is \u25a0 the
thing which one would secure nowa-

fashion is a navy' bine ' in the familiar
shade made : famous . the ; world 'over by
Its beauty In the naval "service. \u25a0 Like
the' coats of the offloers, it is made with
brass buttons ", '\u25a0â¢ and a - touoh '.{ of ' r gold
braid, though there Is not quite enough

in the front there is set a waistcoat of
cream; colored' flannel beautifully em

little hatof blue to go with this very
smart costume.
The ' Colors That Will . Be Wont.
It is Important how to consider the
fashions that are coming in 'and par
ticularly the new" colors. There > fere
tones that are distinctly novel this
spring, though for the most part the
popular ; : tones will rule, the good old
favorites. : -
. ; A" good color for spring yis hello,
which \u25a0is a new name for ; heliotrope.
This and lavender, violet, purple, v
. pansy and 'orchid' purple . make up the
list of distinctly violet hues. They are
all s In L the' violet and" the pansy sjmde.
and there Is a still fainter color, which
is. called violene. It is very delicate,
very light, very pretty and a color
.which, somehow, 'suggests ; scent and
sachet powder. One always fancies it
mingled with the "odors of \ heliotrope. ;.."
"I, am advising everybody >tÂ© "get
plum color," said a modiste just back
from "London, . "particularly ;;, for the
spring tailor-made suit. It is to be the
popnlar'color of spring cmdLt wlliisur
â¢ prise the waiting : wdrld '{ to ! see how
thoroughly the whole ' : universe \u25a0'- will
â¢ blossom out In plum color 1 this spring.
'"Along" {with plum comes the purple

one '. \u25a0 must Include 1 mauve and' deep* red,
which is almost a plum. We are \u25a0 hav
"ing^ a^ great;" time .this J year with our

"In reds we are using the old-fash
ioned turkey red not a little for house
gowns. Then we use garnet and crim
son, scarlet and ' magenta. And this
leads us up right "- into the wonderful
realm of . pink, which, ' '.'\u25a0 by ..-* the ' way,
makes up elegantly, with smoke brown.
"Pink Is to be one of the street colors
this spring. And such pink! There
are; old rose, coral pink, shell pink,
/crushed raspberry, and all the soft old
fashioned shades of pink which once
held ' fashionable \u25a0 supremacy.
<r What do I consider the most f ash
lonable tones of pink? Why, I should
select;: salmon '.color and '. also light
color pink. These i two tones are very -
good and particularly, do they go well
with (black. ' You Â« have no idea , ; ho w
beautifully black . and coral pink can
be made to mix."
'The Real Styles of Spring.
"What win be the street "style ,for'
. spring?": asked one woman of another.
"The styles, say, for the debutantes and
the styles for the^ young matron 7 lam
buying a spring trouseau for myself and
my daughter.^ What; shall it be?"
..In reply } the woman' led her to a win
dow.; whereinwere displayed some gowns
marked "Fashionable Spring;: Costumes."
And this is what she saw: The first gown
\u25a0 was a princess, tight-fitting, setting like
, a mold \u25a0to the back; the , bust, the waist
; and \ the ; hips. 'â¢\u25a0â¢ Below \u25a0it flared wildly and
was finished -with a shorttraln. -/rv ;
V "This," i said .the woman, "Is to Ibe * the
boardwalk gown, the fashionable dress of
'. 1906/ when \u25a0; the summer . styles : come In." \
: Then she ; led , her. to another side of \u25a0 the
same window, and there was a- beautiful
taffeta Eton suit, Just the smartest thing
"one!; could % imagine. iwas a very
-.wide; Dolly/ Varden skirt, shirred around
jl the ) hips \ and ? made ! walkings length,'; with
i two \ tucks I In- the i skirt;;; And â¢ there was
tho neatest of Eton coats,* trimmed with a
; handsome* touch of : braid and embroidery,
and there was a wonderful : girdle, with a
.buckle as wide as the girdle. And reclin
ing; against It > was. a blue silk umbrella
with. a gold handle, and crowning the ele
gantly dressed figure was a very light felt
; hat; with gold quills and; a big. chou of
velvet/This madÂ©- a handsome spring

", Tho spring i styles show two extremes,
and each Is, in equally good taste. There
; Is the^ princess, which Is always charm-
Ing, and this -: season Is particularly so.
/And there is the , Eton suit, which . is as
\ lovely as ' It be in "its new develop
.; ment, which is tightly fitted, beautifully
trimmed and fully shaped to the shoulder
-and wrist .The sleeves are full.
"What Will the Easter Hat Be t
; , "I know ; lt is coming,"., said a fashion
able woman, "and I know it will be my
\u25a0 undoingâ the poke \u25a0\u25a0 hat*
1. It t ls*;a> fact f that; the:hat 0* Easter
threatens to be a poke. .Those who recall
the styles of last summer's millinery will
remember how greatly they differed from
those of previous seasons. The bats were
positively Gothic, so bent werÂ© they. aoÂ»
twisted, bo turned this way and that way.
and so oddly trimmed. "Women had to =get
used to them after a period of probation.
This spring there will bÂ« another sur
prise In store, for the Easter cat will
be a poke. And what the poke mean* to
the average woman can little- be de
scribed It 1* hideously unbecoming, t? all
except a cherished few. and- these must
be great beauties. .â.*;, ...
"There were few beauties In 1340." jald
a woman, -because tn those dayÂ» the big
poke hat waa the thing, and very" few
could wear it. And the same will be true
again. If the poke hat corns* In. It Is
very trying, and there will be Terr few
pretty women who can stand the test
Jt wUI make nearly ail the women look
llks frights."
Yet this la an extreme statement. The
poke bat may be made universally be
coming if treated rightly. Those wao
cannot wear it war back from the face
can wear.lt tipped forward and. to this
way, it is becoming to * great many. It
can be trimmed on top with flowers and
at the side with, feathers, so that it Im not
the hideous thing whioh t fancy paints It
In the minds of many.
The Easter gown may be a princessâ
the boardwalk gownâ with- this the poks
hat is particularly good. Zt can be in
pink, say, which is tit appropriate for
the poke, and it can be trimmed with
plumes. The boardwalk princess can be
built of the new oanvas, which is glossy
and fine. In color it may be salmon pink
or smoke brown. Both are fashionable.
OTtulas foÂ» the Boardwalk.
"Things have come to a great pass,"
sighed a mother to her daughter, "wfcsa
we must have boardwalk gowns. There
iwas once a time when we were content
with a few light summer dresses. But
now we must have costumes: for the
South, coatumts for 7t!m Beach, sun par
lor dresses, reception gowns, Canada, 00*
tumes and, last but not least, the boald
walk toilets. What shall we have nsxtf*
"Roof garden dresses, mamma.'* ven
tured the girl.
The mother gasped, **My daughter, I hasl
forgotten. We must have roof garden
dresses. And no wardrobe is complete
without something pretty to light up well
at night under the Chinese lanterns) They
say that dressing is cheaper than It used
to be because silk 1* lowÂ«r in price and
velvet is within the reach of every one.
But when I come to count up I find that
it costs as much as ever because of the
variety of dresses one needs."
"But the materials are cheapâ and
mostly hand-embroidered," ventured the
daughter.
"True, and this spring there 'win be
more hand embroidery than ever. Per
haps," said the mother, â¢'when we reckon
upon the ways in which the gowns are
made over, the sleeves puitsd at the
shoulders, cut off at the elbow, trimmed
with odds and ends of la.se ,and with
straps of fur, the cost Is not so very
great after aIL"
The sleeves of the coming winter will
be a sort of leg-o'-mntton. This is de
scribed by a Paris paper as melon
shaped. They will be shaped lust like a
melon at the shoulder, while the cuff will
tapex from, the elbow flown.
The full shoulder wui bÂ« the rule, and
there will be few of the tight-flttlng
sleeves. This is good, as It makes the
shoulders look wider.
Stocks will be fussier than tUey were
last year, and the tiny little ruchings will
be worn a great deal These are narrow
and will be used to complete the-' throat.
One also sees these- tiny ruehings around
the wrist, where they give the needed
finish to the glove.
Shoetops will matcn the gown In every
case.* and when you have your dress mada
you must have a scrap reserved for your
boots. Gloves are made in the same way.
matched from a sample of tho gown. And
with every waist there are two pairs of
gloves, the long or bridge gloves* coming
up above the elbow,' and the wrist gloves.
-The big chiffon muffs will be carried
far into the spring, and the woman with
Bhort sleeves can bury her hands in her
muff to the elbows.FITZ - IN THE HOUR OF HIS DEFEAT
UNDOUBTEDLY "Fitzs heart is
broken." The morning papers
tell me that before â as I find out
laterâ the blood of the fight has
\u25a0 CeaSe<J t0 fl Â° W - c .
11ns. Adams of the Adams House,
who knows more about the sporting
.-:\u25a0-â¢
fraternity, than any sporting writer
even thinks he knows, tells me so over
the phone when she tells me -Fitz is
still in bed, immured from the public
that is now, no longer his public.
Is she sure, I ask, that he wiA stay
In bed, or In. his room, or in the house
until I can get there?
"Sure! ..-His heart's broken and he
doesn't feel like going out."
Fitz Is In the hands of his masseur
when I *rrive, and he is not. yet "fit
for a lady to see." his manager tells
me. So I wait behind \he desk in the
office with 'Mrs. Adams, preferring her
entertaining company to lonely state
in the parlor, 'and watch the news
"paper men go right up without wait-
Ing for Fitz to be prettied. *
Here my list of People I Have Met is
increased by The' Sulllvans â Twins,
who with professional courtesy solic
itously inquire about Fltz but decTlne
to go up, deciding it would be rather
Indelicate because, they betted against
aim and are some hundreds richer by
his downfall. They murmer in duet,
when they knew I am waiting to see
him. o
'"Sbeart's brokeAk Yea, Fitz's heart's
broken."
His manager conducting me at last*
to the presence prepares me on the way
with "He's feeling terrible, of course;
his heart's broken."
In his room the athletic young men
supporting Fitz with 6ilent sympathy
rise In greeting when I enter and In
response to the formalities of Intro-
duction look sorrowfully at Fitz and
say "His heart's broken."
The lengthy gladiator of a day that
is done, "swathed in- bath., robe and
blanket, the famous toupee carefully
in place notwithstanding the state of
his heart, gives me a big:, hairy hand,
shakes his head sadly, squeezes shut
the little crack of battered eye that the
fight has left open and tells me him
self v.-hen 1 ask him:
"How do you feel?"
"Oh, Gawd! My. 'cart's broke, my
'cart's broke for good this time."
And the elevator boy, fearful lest
the information should have escaped
me, tells me as he lets trie out:. "I guess
it'-s all up with Jilm as a fighter now â
his heart's broken." â¢ â¢
So, as I said .at the beginning, un
doubtedly Fitz'*s heart is broken. .
It is only by his voice and his man- .
ncr that the bitterness of his grief and*
the depth of . his sorrow are conveyed
to me. . ' .
His face, alas,, is-, temporarily in
capable of expressing the emotions of
the soul, his eyes as mirrors "of it are
in eclipse.
His countenance-^even -/after the
ministrations of the \u25a0 masseur and the
glutting of the leechesâ is; a; bruised
and purplish lumpy thing, dimly and
grotesquely featured,, defying- identi
fication by photograph or, Bertillon
system. ' '. .

Perhaps I'll manage my wife. Tm
having an opera written for her. She
has the finest soprano voice In this
country."
"And." I supplement, "she's very
pretty."
"Yes." he says in that curioas
troubled way that Is his on this aft
ernoon, "sha is."
He' does not. It seems to my unsat
isfied expectation, act the part of a*
man on w^hom a blow has fallen, but
rather of one expecting a blow.
The next morning It has fallen.
I am at the Alhambra to see. ' Mr.
Fitzsimmons rehearsed â as I suppose.
He meets me with" that bis welcom
ing right that will swing no -more
swings and cut no more uppercuts to
glory.
He tells me no more press agent
stories and tries on me no more mono
logue samples. > \
"Oh, Gawd," he says huskily, with
his back to the players on the bare
stage, "my 'cart's broke all right this
morning. There's not a sadder man in
San Francisco than I am. .I've lost â
I've lost more than a fight."
"If I could do it I'd go East on the
first train and see for myself.
'"Ere I am, tied up to THI3 when
I'd give my. "cad to be able to gat
away."
He is talking to himself as much
as to me, and pulling the champion
(5000 French poodle's tufts of whiskers
until the poodle protests with a soft
little whine. Then he makes amends
by patting his head and smoothing his
ears.
"No, it's not the losing of tha fight
that 'urts, and It's not business. TL'% â \u25a0 'â¢'
He doesn't say what It is and he
doesn't need to, of course.
What it is is a week-old story now.
But the rehearsal of "A Fight fo*
Liove" must go on, ever* over broken
hearts, and It Is Fitz who rehearses
the actors, and not. as I thought, .the
other way round.
'"Ere." he says, "that's not the way
to do that. Don't laugh. Do It this
way. Go up like this," be hunches
a shoulder, projects his chin and swag
gers, "and say it like this: â¢ :
"â¢But If you TROW me after it's
done It's yours next! Do you under
stand DAT? YOURS next!"
It is a lesson In acting to young Mr.
Berger who takes his acting friv
olously.
'"Ere," calls Mr. Fitzsimmons as the
real actors troop off helter skelter â
"'Ere. don't you KNOW â ladles flrsV
" "Remember you ara safe so lon* as
there Is ladles present' â that's the cue.
and there you go, but let the LADY
go first. 'Ow the well, 'ow would it
look if you didn't?"
However lightly, however frivolous
ly tho others, the real actors, may take
"A Fight for Love." Mr. Fitzsimmons
sees no frivolity in It.
\u25a0 It is Fitz as he^ s'ee3 himself and
nothing could exceed the courtliness
\u25a0with which he rehearses the lines:
. "Allow me. Miss Ellington, to pre
sent you this New horse shoe as a
souvenir of our meeting."
Nothing, unless it is the fervor with
which ho clasps the leading lady to his
ample . chest â after transferring -her
from the wrong arm to- the right for
the sake of the picture â and exclaims:
"HOW could I lose, Vivian, when It
was a fight for love!" \u25a0*
I don't know how It Is at other re
hearsals, but on this morning the love
scenes hold an added Interest for Fits,
poor F,ltz, who, one of hts friends
whispers to me, "Is as affectionate as
a dog." and they hold an added pathos
for -the lookers-on who already more
than suspect why there Is suoh fervor
and such passion in the delivery of his
lines. Fltz is finding an outlet.

As I run down the steps of the

PARTS has taken to wreathsâveri
table Napoleon -wreaths. Several
very fashionable women have re
cently appeared so crowned at the
opera and state balls. The fashion is
bat a natural outcome of the Empire
craze, which has been growing ever
sine* the autumn arrival of Empire
coats.
Of course, olive leaves are first favor
ites, most of them Just touched with
gold or silver or made of pailletted
gauze. Fortunately, there are variations,
since this particular wreath is too try
ing to be worn indiscriminately. Fern
leaves dusted with gold or silver make
a wreath becoming to both blondes and
brunettes. Roses, forget-me-nots and
other tiny flowers are brought into rlay,
always with a suggestion of the long
Empire shape.
The wreaths are made on a tiny wire
frame (which should match your hair in
color) about a half inch wide in front,
eloping to a loop at the end. This makes
it fit comfortably, and, too, permits the
leaves or flowers to be fastened in place
without too much heavy overlapping.
The conventional Empire lines should
be followed as nearly as possible, but
innumerable imperceptible changes may
be made to suit various lines of face
and head.
The high coiffure, which fills up the
crown with curls and puffs, is most
fashionable. Beautifully undulated waves
follow lines pointing in a puff over the
forehead and waving downward toward
the back. One woman with a pure Greek
profile appeared with her parted black
hair coiled in a classic knot, crowned
with silver like a goddess. E. D.
The Hard Uphill Climb of the Woman Writer
Some Advice to the Beginner in This Profession
By Cynthia Westerner Alden
Copyrljrht. 1903. by A. S. Barnes & Co.
SALARIES of newspaper women dif
fer with different localities and
the character of the newspaper
concerned; and personality is every
thing in the getting of news. Until ex
perience has done its perfect work, no
young woman can expect to earn more
than the average salary of a reporter,
say $15 or $25 a week. This is, in New
York city, only a little less than men
are receiving for the same work. In
some Western cities, I understand, the
rates are slightly higher. I know of
one woman in Denver, Col., who receives
$30 a week for reporting.
Let me warn the aspirant against
philosophy and fine writing. No matter
how clever a woman may be, there is
Uttle chance that she will be able to rival
lx>ck*Â», or Bacon, or La Rochefoucauld,
or Montaigne, or Benjamin Franklin, at
first. If she trios to deal with generali
ties and write glittering introduction?,
her copy will be cut to pieces unmerci
fully, because her remarks are likely to
be either all wrong or all stale. The
living, breathing world is intolerant of
upstarts and imitators. The living,
breathing story of what has happened
is demanded from her pen. That is tho
\u25a0 news. That is the new thing. As for
style, the shortest words, the shortest
sentences, the clearest forms of expres
sion are best. Addison is obsolete, and
Kipling is the best model, if a model
the woman journalist must have. Frank
ly speaking, I would prefer to try a girl
who has no model ; she is far more likely
to render her writing intelligible within
a brief period of training
Qualifications. .
The country girl should not come to
Xew York with the intention of making
Â«.a living in journalism without enough
moÃey to make her safe from privation

tions. I shall try to enumerate them as
briefly as possible.

central teeth, which' are called
"the loVer central incisors." At
anytime from the eighth to the twelfth

"tipper incisors," may be expected, so

tion. If the aspirant has broader culture
than such an education implies, so much
the better. She cannot possibly know too
much. But English grammar and spell
ing are indispensable' acquirements if
tolerable manuscript is to be produced.
.Secondâ A legible hand. If a woman
can use a typewriting machine, there
will be many occasions when she can
make her manuscript better by so doing;
but often the use of such a machine â¢rfiil
be absolutely impracticable.
Third â The manners of a woman of
good society. I do not refer to Society
with a big "S." That is another thing.
The manners of the best people in Osh
kosh, or Spring Valley, or Cripple Greek
are good enough. But coarseness is un
pardonable in a woman who. is going out
every day to talk with womanly women
in the necessary collection of news.
Equipped with these qualifications,
freed from nervousness by the fact that
she la temporarily provided for. the
young woman will find it worth her
while to study newspapers before she
goes into a newspaper office. She should
learn what sorts of matter are printed
every morning and ask herself whether,
in the same fields, there is not some un
printed story that she knows or can
lind out about. If there is. let her write
it up. With this article she may go to
any office .and ask for the city editor or
the editor of the woman's department.
She will equally avoid coquettlshness
and constraint. She will say: "I am Miss
Brown, of Stamford. I have come to
New York to learn to be a reporter. I
want a chance to learn. Please look over
this story and see if It Is worth using,
and give me an assignment to try me.
I am ready to do any work you can put
me to."
The editor will say "yes" or "no." If
he says "no," she must try another of
fice in the same way. She must not.
feel personally hurt or aggrieved, if
work is not immediately forthcoming.
It Is not Miss Brown, of Stamford, who
has been rejected. It is an inexperienced
applicant for work. If she persists in
her study of newspapers and her at-
exercise, and should be allowed if the
baby does It of his own accord, but do
not urge him to do so; he knows better
than his mother when his little limbs
are strong enough tor sucn exercise.
Creeping is ruinous to white dresses,
petticoats and stockings; therefore many
mothers make "creeping aprons" for
their babies to use while on the floor.
These aprons are made of fine gingham,
ana may be put on over the dress or
'worn without -one in very hot weather.
They are usually made to button ali tho
way down the back, and sometimes have
an clastic or drawstring run into the
hem at the bottom of the apron, so that
the white skirts may be kept clean.
One mother of twin babies, who found
It necessary to economize in the matter
of washing, made for her children some
creeping trousers. In summer they were
made'of thin gingham, and in winter of
outing flannel. They were cut after the
pattern of ordinary worsted leggings,
coming all the way down to the ankles
and having broad elastic to go over the
feet and prevent the leggings from clip
ping up. They were made quite full and
long enough to tie under the armpits.
The little white dresses were, then
smoothly tucked in and the babies al
lowed to tumble about to their hearts'

Introductions and Points of Etiquette
What to Say When You Bring persons Together
By" Eleanor; B. Clapp' ,-
Copyright, 190 S. by A.", S. Barnes & Co.
IN MAKING an introduction, tlie gen
tleman -is presented: to the
lady, : and \u25a0 when there is a .wide 'dif
'terencemintage,"-the; younger,' lady to
the olde>.*;lt is sufficient simply to men
tion the two names, as "Mrs. Brown, Mr.
Gray," but rather more dignified and el
egant to say, "Mrs. Brown, allow me to
introduce (or "to present") Mr. Gray."
When 1 people are Introduced to each
other,; the most graceful thing to Ido is
for'eaclf to make a. slight bow and pro
nounce the other's name. It is perfectly
good . form, however, to say, \u25a0-, "How do
you do, Mr. Gray?" or "Mrs. Brown?"
if one prefers to do so; but it is in real
ity - rather * meaningless, \u25a0 as naturally
one cannot be greatly .concerned about
the' health t of -a. new. acquaintance.
Whenever . L hear people- do this on first
being introduced, iit always makes me
think involuntarily of. .the story of the
old Irishwoman who met a friend one
day. "Good morning. Mrs. O'Brien,"
said she. "How do you do?-; Not 'that I
care , a darn, â¢ lnit just for the sake of
conversation." Another conventional re
ply to an introduction is. "I am .happy
to ..meet 'you,"; or "Delighted to; meet
you." This is used rather more by
men than by women; but it Is good form
for either scx^-- â¢

occurredHo us until we are confronted
by the dilemma, >. Now, whether to rise
or not after an Introduction' is, ' curiously
enough, "to a great many people just one
of these puzzling little points.' -."When- a
man is presented' to -her r a- lady always
â¢ v bows and remains seated.;.; But when
.the â¢ introduction is - made between two
ladles, should the. one who is sitting
down rise to , acknowledge it? is the
.question that Is continually cropping up
in one form or another. On the face of
it, to rise immediately would be an awk
ward thing to do, unless i the, lady were
1 very old and' one : wished ; to â¢ show ex
treme respect.' ' So, '\u25a0 In â¢ the ordinary \ form
of introduction % between : two ladies, it
would not be necessary for the one who
is sitting : down \u25a0to â¢ rise , unless they en
tered into conversation, when to rise, if
the other lady remained standing, would
be imperative.;: \u25a0\u0084'
A" hostess always makes a point of
1 rising to receive all A-isitors :as they
arrive, unless "she is a very elderly, lady,
and she naturally rises when they ap
proach her to take their, leave. ,
Sometimes at an afternoon tea or "at

this occasion on^emain seated, and often
she half rises; from her seat, : thinks the

time rather uncertain whether ,or .not
she has done the 'right thing. Now,; the

FADS FOR GIRLS
WHOSE INCOMES
ARE NOT LARGE
nOHE<ONE-a girl with only a very
\u25a0^"^ " modest sum to dress on each year â
%*J said the other day that she ac
i - complished the . odd little style
which characterizes her clothes by "go
ing in" 'very strenuously for fads. *
Realizing that that allowance couldn't,
by any possibility; give her the variety
of things she wanted, she very wisely
gave. up attempting it, and confined her
attention to the tiny accessories of dress
âor, rather, made . a specialty of those
little things.
Every season she goes over her
clothes,' planning < out - just what she
must have, making out a list and ruth
lessly "cutting off everything that 3he
: can spare. The things which remain on
'her list. she gets first, and takes plenty
oX time to it, choosing carefully and
sticking "to, her first plans, instead of
yielding to alluring bargains here and
there.
After the main things are got she sets
herself the task , of making collars and
bolts and the prettiest of. sets for shirt
waists and blouses. As the -main ex
pense in such -little things is the work â
and the ingenuity which makes for
style-rs he manages to provide herself
with a good variety, in spite of that deli
cate purse. Zl';Z 1 ' ; ,;:
Odd little ' bows of bright velvet rib
bon perched just under her chin set off
a deep turnover; collar which, in itself,
was a marvel' of hand-run tucks and tiny
vines * embroidered delicately on the
sheerest of linen. A hit of Irish crochet
âapparently too small for any use, but
too beautiful to throw awayâ was given
her. She combined bits of Valenciennes
lace with.it,; in the way some of â¢ the
most daintily elaborate stocks are treat
ed this year. \ * ,
But beit3 were her especial 'hobby,
known and indulged by her friends. All
i sorts of quaint, interesting buckles find
their way into her. collection. There's
an odd Japanese oneâ just a' little thing
âwhich Is made Of two Japanese char
acters worked out in = silver, which; have
a symbolic .meaning. \ When she got it
first, . nothing seemed to fit with it, until
-the idea of Ing a belt with a
Japanese' motif occurred to her.
Knowing her : interest In -the little
things, air sorts: of, valuable hints drift
to her through ; people who never use
such ideas themselves, yet who find
themselves watching for them quite as
eagerly. > '
Her few silk stockings are made un
usual by embroidering, in exactly the
same shade a3, the "stocking, a few dots
or a tiny flower r or two just over the
instep! .*->
And when that French trick of em
broidering the wrists of gloves - came
out she bought a' pair of plain ones and
embroidered a" .wee. scallop around. t
All these little \ points of difference
about hei arÂ»> (interesting enough to. call
attention to .themselves andâ which Is
why she does? ltâ away from her fre
quent wearing! of * the same things, so
that she is , always, quoted as a well

CRACKS^IN THE FINGERS
A SIMPLE â¢ remedy for the painful
cracks that often appear upon the
ends of, the fingers during the cold
weather was suggested by a lady
the, other day; who says that it is the
best thing' she -ever has tried.
\u25a0'.'Yes, I have; used them all."" she re
plied, when ', I .spoke of compound tinct
ure of benzoln.% shellac and the like;
"but : there is J nothing that gives me so
much relief as a' cracker poultice. I put
it on ; my finger/ at night, and in the
morning- the t soreness 1 is .gone, and the
crack begins 'ââ¢ to 1 heal. . I : . have . poulticed
my,. fingers 'in ithisiway ' for * years, just
as soon as ; a' crack Intakes* its appear
ance, and I never have any more trouble
with v them. Some Â£ people, have cracks,
come upon the "feet;", especially the heels;
a cracker poultice; acts â¢ like a ' charm
upon these - also. 'In* both instances Â« the
cracks; are caused l by, dryness of the
skin, and a consequent. hardening of the
flesh around them ; upon these hardened
places the' poultice, has ;a" softing and
soothing effect. I ', â¢ 7 i : V i ;*SV ~
\u25a0v.This '\u25a0 remedy '\u25a0 la simple; apd within the
reach of all. and Ms well* worth trying.
DAINTY WAYS
TO SEND OUT
YOUR PRESENTS
. Â£% UCH a difference as there la In the
\u25a0> way Christmas presents are . sent
â¢KJ '\u25a0 out! Some of them wrapped up in
, â¢ a way that shows only too plainly
; the evidences of hasteâ or even worse,
of lack of care. Others are wrapped in
the freshest of paper and. tied, daintily
enough, with narrow ribbons In Christ
mas colors. And then, occasionally.
â¢ there Is some one who sends each of her
â¢ presents out wrapped up in some un
usual; characteristic way, with tha
same careful thinking - out of the ar
rangement of paper and ribbon and
. holly that was bestowed u^on choosing:
the present itself. jfry
A cold thimble masked In tinfoil as a
3 bonbon, and put in a box with, real bon
bons, was the unusual way one man
- sent his gift to the girl. he was engaged
. to. It was several days before si?e found
. it out, and in all those days ho never
told!' Finally, one day, she picked It
up, felt the curious hardness of metal
and tore the paper off. Then there was
â¢ a wild dash to the phone, and a "why;
" didn't you tell me?" . . {
â¢ A spray each of mistletoe, and: holly.
; laid on each, side of a green candle
, stick, (which bore a red candle>, gave It
- a pretty little air of distinction, rather
, belied by the saucy bow of scarlet satin
' ' ribbon which was perched up on tba
Â» handle.
But the presents which . have most
possibilities for decoration are flower
vases and receptacles. One of the new
cut glass basket vases would be charm
ing filled with red roses, with a bit of
mistletoe tied on to the handle with nar
row scarlet ribbon. And violets! There
never w&s a woman yet who didn't go
into ecstasies over violets and bury her
face deep in the exquisite purple bloom.
. Not "Christmassy" enough? Then put a
bit of mistletoe on the handle and
you've given the Christmas touch to her
favorite flower.
As to ribbons, they come in a dozen
forms â wee white â¢ tmea with baby
sprays of holly scattered on, wide ones
. with more elaborate sprays and stun
ning French onesâ garish for anything
but the one useâ shading from tha
softest of greens up through stronger j
tones to gay, vivid red. Perhaps
the prettiest touch is . the using of
green and white ribbons, finishing them
. where they cross with a great splotch
of scarlet in the shape of sealing wax.
The smallest possible bits of holly
dangle from each end of the ribbon.
Silk cords and tasselsâ the kind flo
rists use for violets, but in Christmas
colorsâmake stunning packages; and a
cord made of strands of heavy embroid
ery silksâ red. green and whiteâcrochet
ed together In a single chain-stitch. Is
as Interesting as it is unusual. . But it
should end In little tassels.
Like ribbon, paper comes in a dozen
varied forms, from odd treatments of
white tissue paper with little bars and
plaids to the most elaborately printed
crinkled kinds.
After all. It Isn't so much- the things
you use as the way you use them. It's
the distinctive little touches â a novel , \u25a0
way of finishing off a package, or oC
tucking holly or mistletoe on in some
unusual way that makes the recipient
of your gift hesitate over disturbing its
Interesting arrangement, even though
she Is eager to see the contents of the Â»
package.
FOR THE SUIT CASE
TO MAKE a pretty and convenient
sachet for the bureau drawer.
> take one-half yard of light blue
(or pink, or lavender, for that
matter) silesla and double Its width.
The material is so wide that this will
make a bag of abo_ut twenty-four !nchÂ«3
by eighteen. Turning the material over
saves the sewing of one of the shorter
seams. Within this blue bag put two
layers of cotton batting, between which
ia sprinkled the sachet powder.
Over all, place a neat little slip made
of plain, white swiss. Make a hem of
about' one' lnch, and sew . the slip to
gether bymeans^ef blue featherstltch
ingr.- If the laUÂ«r. is done In washable
floss or mercerized cotton, the slip Is
strictly practical, for it can -be washed
time after-time. . .
"'When" you choose .to renew your sa
chet, merely rip one end of yotir silrsia
â¢bag. and pull -out the cotton batting.
Then slip in tfee .new. One of the spe
cially recommended features of this sa
chet bag. which, of course, may be made
in any size. >is Us small cost."More
over, the size' mentioned here* ls w.ell
Suited for"placlng In a suitcase; wh'en
one packs up fer a short trip.
THE WINDOW GARDEN
IF Mistress Housewife is humorously
inclined, shÂ« may add this to her.
window gnrden.- In one of the flo
rists' shops there was .seen a quaint lit
tle fellow, all . head and green hair. It
was in this wi*e: A smart neud of a jolly
old man is modeled in red clay, hollow,
with a bole in the top of his head.
Grooves are cut round and round on his
hea4h where hair would be; also on his
uppÂ¥r lip and on his brows, besides on a
dg&t that ts .ucked In the corner of his
mouth. Th-e '"rad is filled with water to
the top. and when thoroughly moist tiny
seed, which come â¢ from .Germany, to
gether with the head, are sown in the
grooves. * In about four days little
sprouts appear, and in about ten days
morsâ lo! the old fellow has a bristling
crop of green hair about one isch long.
He Is a comical chap, ami the first
glance at him calls forth a smile.These Are

LONDON, Dec. 30. â "Lese Majeste,"
which gets many folk into dire trouble
in Germany, isÂ° not recognized as a crim
inal offense in England,. but still there
are more or lees roundabout ways of
enforcing respect for royalty, and Con
euelo, Djichess of Manchester, has just
set one of them in operation. A short
avhile ago, in the somewhat aristocratic
eubifrbaji town of Kingston-on-Thames,
ehe saw conspicuously displayed in a
iawnbroker's shop and ticketed for sale
s unredeemed pledges a dozen photo
raphs of members of the royal family,
icluding the King and Queen anil the
rince and Princess of Wales.
The "American dowager, whose long
esidence in England and close intim
cy with royalty have greatly modified
lie democratic uotions she brought
r ith her from across the Atlantic, was
orrined* at the spectacle. To her it
ppearcd nothing less than . sacrilege
!iat the poi traits of these exalted per
jnages should be subjected to such
?norairiy. The fact that they were
ffered for sale at "bargain prices"
lade the offense siilj more heinous in
er estimation. She had frequently
jtfd similar portraits herself at faeh
mable bazaars and had never accepted
>r thejn* less than thrice what the
hotographers charge.

LONDON, .Dec. ' 30. â Many clever

They have fitted their receptions -with

-hat?^,he result would be a brilliant ex

Spectal Cnblr to The Call.
ROME, Dec. 30. â Margherita, . the
Queen Mother of Italy, fs really going
to make a tour of the United States.
It has not yet been decided on exactly
what date she will start, but it will
probably be eaxly next spring. She
intends to "doâ¢ America in a motor
car, and to avoid the fuss and. cere
mony with which she was thoroughly
satiated during the long years that she
shared Italy's throne with King Hum
bert, she will travel incognito. She will
assume the title Â«of Countess of Stupir
nigi. taking the name from her castle
of Stupinigo. which is her favorite
summer residence. Since she took to
"moting" Rome has seen little of her,
as she has devoted herself to exploring
most of the countries "of Europe. And
now the rostless Dowager Queen
yearns for the novel experiences and
[larger freedom to be found in the New
World.
She Hi especially anxious to see some
thing of the Wild West. The other day
speaking to an American of her desire
to visit the United States, she said in
nocently. "I want particularly to - go
West, as I know Bret Harte's sketches
well, and I should so like to meet some
of his types:" One wonders ;what
would happen if the good Queen, who.
is graciousnoss iteelf but an aristocrat
to her finger tips, should suddenly ap
pear in a mining camp in Nevada. But
thir. is the spirit in which she is plan
ning her trip.
Strangely enough the Queen Mother
used to be much prejudiced against
motor cars and would not hear of en
tering one, It Is said, because she con
sidered them so ugly and dangerous.
One day, however, she allowed herself
to be persuaded to take a spin with
her son. King Victor, but alas, the
brake refused to work and they nego
tiated a hill at a pace -which -made
Queen Margherlta's hair stand 'on end
and, worse still, they ran over a dog,
but with it all the royal lady felt that
she had at last found a cure for her
maladies â melancholy and restless
ness. :. .. .;\u25a0 ->\u25a0-.;; *"v.'.
SHOCK TO HER XKRVKS.
The first time King Humbert's life
was attempted was \u25a0In her presence,
and the shock so affected her nerves
that the doctors were seriously alarm
ed, although the public in general was
unaware of the fact. Her nervousness
took the form of extreme and acute
restlensness,- which would not allow
her any repose. Motor cars were then
unknown, to she was taken' to iNice,
accompanied by a most accomplished
musician, whose duty and delight It
was to play to her for hours. Under
this treatment, which was veuy slow,
she quite recovered. . never having a
touch of it again until her husband
was assassinated., Since then the old
restlessness has returned, but now she
has her automobile and when flying
even at the moderate pace she adopts â â¢
is tranquil and happy. "It is^only
thus," she said lately to j an . intimate,
"that the vision of my husband as they
brought him horaÂ« to . me 'dead leaves
me. When in my dear motor car I 'am
a normal woman.".
The arrangements for her American
tour are causing the Queen -Mother
some trouble because of her' desire .to
make every lady concerned in ' it .happy.
There -is that' dreadful ocean to "cross
and her favorite. lady-in-waitingr' is no
longer young and , has a, dread of the
Â»<ea. If the Queen Jeaves her behind
her trip will be marred; if she takes
the lady with, her .there- will.be wail
ing if not gnashing of teeth, as be
sides entertaining exaggerated . notions

of the ocean's terrors the good woman"
believes that the- West is peopled ex
clusively by ' lawless desperadoes and
scalp-hunting Indians.
A POWERFUL. MACHIXE.
For the trip' the Queen has acquired
a new Fiat automobile of sixty horse
power from the world-famed Italian
firm. That it' will be equipped in the
most luxurious style goes without say
ing. It will accommodate six people.
The Queen will take with her a gen
tleman and lady .in waiting,, her. maid
and an expert Italian chauffeur, who is
now taking lessons in English, which
the Queen, by the way, speaks perfect
ly. There will be a vacant seat for
an occasional guest.
- It was in 1868 that Princess Mar
gherita Marie. Therese < Jeanne of Sa
voy, daughter ; of Duke Ferdinand . of
Genoa, wedded her cousin. Prince Hum
bert. She had been married only; two
years when she was called upon to
take up the difficult position of wife
to the heir apparent of the kingdom
of' United Italy, at a time when the uni
ty consisted chiefly in a name.
No bed of roses awaited Humbert
when he came to the throne, and few-
Queens have . had. a larger share of
trouble than Margherita. . But- in 'the
same degree that the heroism and,self
oblivion of King Humbert, during the
fearful cholera, year at â¢ Naples, helped
indirectly to establish his dynasty on
the throne even' more than did his gal
lantry in i the field, so did the devotion
the Queeni displayed in those dark day's
in visiting the ; hospitals and tending
the suffering win her a warm place', in
the hearts of. the Italian people, which
she has ever since held. She has well
earned tire release- from the cares of
state which she has enjoyed since her
son became King Victor Emmanuel 111.
ON BEST OF'TERJIS.
They are on the best' of ,;terms, but
in the first days . of his reign the young
King- made" it apparent* that " in affairs
of .state his masterful- will' was - para

its musical charms, the guitar with its

with hers. Miss Padelford, another
American girl who Jsia 'great favorite
here; is quite an accomplished perform

asked to bring it.
It is the banjo which the Duchess of
Roxburghe favors and/ plays " really
well. She sings "coon" songs delight
fully. I hear it is to her rendering of
these simple ditties that she owes her
great popularity with the Princess of
Wales, who is very fond or them. The

"infr* dig". for his wife to perform on

LONDON. Dec. 30. â Though in the do
main of science Lord Rayleigh, who has
just-been elected president of the Royal
Society, is regarded as one of the most
distinguished physicists and mathema
ticians in the world. .In London he is
better known as one of its most-en
terprising and successful dairymen.
Aristocratic Mayf air swears by his
milk. So # does the plebeian East End,
where large quantities of it are sold
to retail dealers., It is sent up every
morning by a special train from the
fat pasture" land .. around Terling, his
beautiful Essex ' home, where "he has
over- 1500 cows grazing.
There is no sailing under false colors
about this peer's business. Each of
his dairies bears the sign in large let
ters, "Lord Rayleigh." He also sells
butter and cream and -"fresh" eggs
that are: really fresh. Incidentally, he
makes a lot of money as a milkman â
a great deal more than he has ever
made out of any of his scientific dis
coveries. But nobody begrudges him
if. It was not to make money that he
first went Into business. He embarked
in; It from humanitarian motives, being
convinced Athat â¢ one of the greatest
needs of the day to insure a' healthy
race is pure milk.
There is' no doubt that he has saved
the lives of hundreds of babies, which
many folk 1 would consider a greater
achievement than > the discovery of a
new gas. by making the, business
paj"-^and pay handsomely â he has af
forded a much more instructive object
lesson in the value of commercial hon
esty than if he had merely run it as a
charity.
His dairy farm furnishes a practical
demonstration of the "value of science
applied Ao the humble cow. He has
the finest herd in Europe. .The sanita
tion Js, perfect "and absolute cleanliness
is. enforced > in every department. He
*egaÂ«- Sellings milk'Mna^small "way by
supplying- local" customers and having
thereby proved that pure .'milk paid" he
began. opening shops in:Loridon. Some
previous 'competitors assert that their
success is 'owing in' no small measure
to the fact that they , are associated
with a peerage. But that is an error.
Had Lord Rayleigh hoisted over them
his plain baptismal name, John, Strutt,
the same methods would have made
them v equally successful, j Â§ Peerages
don't count for much in trade, in these
days when the novelty of the thing has
worn off. There are several peers in
the beer business^ but their breweries
do not sell an extra pint on that ac
count.
VISITS PLACE MEEKLY.
For some years Lord Rayleigh's
brother, the Hon. Edward Strutt, has
had general supervision of the milk
business, but once a week Lord Ray
leigh visits his main shop in Great
Russell street and overhauls the ac
counts. \; He was not senior wrangler
of Cambridge for nothing. With his
increasingvknowledgc of the higher
mathematics he* has. lost none of his
proficiency in simple arithmetic. His
tenants in Essex regjard _him as the
cleverest man in the world. Members
of the House of Lords are not given to
excessive veneration of any mortal., but
none of their number do they honor
more highly than Lord Rayleigh. be
cause he proves to the world that a
hereditary" peer may be the most bril
liantof scientists.

tremes "the- discoverer of argon draws

event as did the youngest native. When

a programme of entertainment and
speechmaking, the principal one of these
being "If Our Mothers Would Listen." by-
Miss Harriet S. Lee, one of the most en

' It' was the morning after. The very
"air seemed dx&Y of it. The big Christ
mas tree, towering and glittering in
the c St* Francis lobby, seemed only a
part* of ,ii,Â° of Alice Neilsen's triumph^
Of the nlgfet before. Even his sophisti
cated majesty, the bellboy, seemed im
pressed, "tweaking a discreet thumb
over his c shoulder in" the direction of
the 'bit eft a girl coming to meet me
Irom the elevatorf
' "It's Aljee Nielsen.". the man next me
whispered to the man next him,
"Alice Njelsen." the ermined woman
passed on* to hec friend in mink, sister
ly rejoicing: in^ her smile. j
the* bored 'person at the counter,
even, had* taken time to say. as I hand- :
cd in my 'card, Avful glad the little
woman has made good. She's a sweet
Jittle thing."
Then a soft, small, eager: "How d'ye
do?" and a" friendly little hand tucked |
into, jnine. and 1 had met Alice Nielsen.-
Where should we talk? Not there, in
the hall, for all the keen, clean, sweet I
end spice of the tree alluring. Nor in j
file -library â where there were more |
folk Xt whisper "Alice Nielsen." Up
stairs we went, fourth floor.
Haven't a. drawing-roomâ yet," the
little finger laughed, but there was
(nothing to quarrel with the spacious
quarters into which we turned.
* It wa6 when my hostess dragged up
the next coziest seat that I found that
"little" Alice Nielsen's eyes were level
\u25a0with mine. Honorably I had given her
more than our noble 5 feet 4, yet I
defy any one to her aught but
â¢little."- She is that kind, a slim, dim
pled, demure, nestling thing that you
want to stroke. Her round, hazel eyes
look^up at >ou with trustful appeal, her
round,^ childlike cheek is another ap
peal. Her baby mouth seems to pout,
"Please be? good to me," and you would
tirink him a villain indeed who should
Jiring a frown to that smooth, chijd
brow. '
Yet life has meant hard things to
Alice Nielsen. That was whtft we be-
Kan TTith â some of the hard things.
AWiimpering? No. Anything else I
hearfl Â« trbm Alice Nielsen. Of the
2^'fv? York critics, who would appear
to have been manifestly unjust to her.
Â£he Â«lmply said: "I Oppose they just
didn't like me" â then beamed â "but 111
make them fike me some day." She did
not say *1t was hard to come home to
*be so treated." She did not suggest
-critical Mafias, critical igno
rance Â°or stupidity. Siiyply she "sup
posed that the critics did not like her."
i There tvas the same line tolerance in
her .viewpoints throughout. There is.
in. fact, all sorts of curious strength
v- \u25a0 <i *visdom behind Alice Nielsen's baby
make-up. Here we have all known
that bjehind her demure deviltry lay a
large ambition. We have not known,
:nos^ of us,. of the long faithfulness to
an artistic ideal that has governed
the little singer's life. Nor have we
known of her reverent studentship, of
the long, stern sacrifice that has placed
her .where she is. Perhaps tlie Xielsen
dimple* have helped â why r. â pinee
singers must be seen a%= we!; . : heard?
4-nd I found in M;-> Nielsen a fine
grace of gratitude, a most wholesome
modesty, a largo courage, and, above
all. the â¢sweet reasonableness before
mentioned, that muFt hr.ye gone far to
contribute to her success.
In a word then Â«he disposed of the
New T<ork critics, and added blithely:
"But*S&n Francisco made up last night."
"Afraid?" to my inquiry. "I should
think I was afraid! Never was more
nervous in my life! Id had such a big
success in comic opera here, and I was
afraid you would think I didn't belong in
grand opera. But the minute after my
first scng^L kntw you were with me â oh,
Wit I was happy."
So were we, I told her. And how did
?he like our new Tivoli?
"It's lovely." said the o!d Tivolean.
"but" â this with a real sigh, "honestly I
missed the old house. It was such a dear,
homely, comfy old holeâ wasn't it? But
this new olace is beautiful, like an Ital
ian theatejr" â she added, out of her new
knowledge.
"But it was at the old Tivoli you be
"That I rcallv began." she corrected.
Penitently she whispered then that she
was not a Californian. and I soared her
any further confession here. It was as
Yum Yum that her California career be
csn, and of aii piares at the Oakland
Theater. Before thatâ well, she told it
this way.
'We were very poor, you know, mother,
couldn't do anything to help me. I was
!â¢!)* youngest of eight, and the only one of
them that helped motherâ the only one
that could help her." swiftly, this.
"Wasn't it nice I could? But 1 was in a
juvenile company when I was eight years
o'd. and â well. 1 feel I have been pretty
much grown-up ail my life." Then came
t!ie Oakland days, where those who re
member thing? remember a. round-eyed,
pig-tailrd girl going to and from the the
ater. Then came the Wigwam days in
San Francisco.
"I'm proud of that time." the little singer
Ijuis-h'd. "Imagine. I got $o a week for
f;inging # ballads, and doing condensed
Â«>ptra. And r.hat do you think? I gave
that up for Â«0 a week at the Tivoli. AND
the chance to pinf; 'real' things!" She did
rot say that sho was proud of that.
The nag"<* in "Nanon" was her first part
Â«t the Tivoli, she remembered. Then,
"everything."' She understudied every
body. She sang all sorts of parts. Sata-

SHOW OF THE KAN FRANCISCO SOCIETY OF ARTISTS.
nella was her first real chance. Seven
teen months of this, the Wigwam dan
gling its $90 a week meanwhile before her,
and then the Bostonlans heard her. "You
don't need to tell, but it was Lucia, in
English, that I was singing!â God forgive
me!" she laughed. Followed then Miss
Nielsen's well-known successes with the
Bostonians, and her after starring period
in "The Singing Girl" and ;'The Fortune
Teller." It was in "The Fortune Teller"
that she went to London, under the direc
tion of George Musgrove. And it was in
"The Fortune^Teller" that Henry Russell
heard her, and The Chance came.
Henry Russell! There was a big, beau
tiful gratitude in Miss Nielsen's voles as
she said the name. There was gratitude
in her hazel eyes, there was all gratitude
in her next qulpk words.
'There now â if you want an interview.,
there is one worth while. Oh, I simply
cannot tell you what Mr. Russell has
done for me. He has done everything.
He has taught me everything; he has
given me every "opportunity. It is only
right I should say this, that you should
understand it, that you should tell the
people about it."
"I had hoped Mr. Russell would be
here," I told her. The next minute she
was in the next room. There was a chat
ter of Italian, another evidently home
made Italian at the other end iher
maid), a click, a pause, a sÂ»igh, and she
was back."
"Mr. Russell is out," she said, and "I
talk Italian like a Chinese, don't I?"
"I thought it pretty good last night,"
I told her.
"Caruso says it is good," Miss Nielsen
laughed, "but then he is very kind. He
is most kind. What do you think? He
came to meet me at the steamer at New
York and told the reporters how good I
was. He did it just to help me, I undexr
stand "
"Back to London." l ordered.
"It was~the queerest way I went to
Mr. Russell," she dutifully related then.
-One of my chorus girls went to study
with him, and she annoyed me to death
about this wonderful teacher of hers.
I suppose she annoyed him to death
about me. Then there was a man that
kept asking Mr. Russell to go to hear
meâ Fernando Valero, another singer.
He told him â Mr. Russell did â that he
was sure I had 'a voice like a cat!' I
guess it was to get rid of them both that
he did come' to hear me at last."
"And went into raptures "
"Not so that you coulc notice it." Miss
Alice grinned. "In fact he said he didn't
know what kind of a voice it was. that
it was all tremolo in the middle, that
it was perhaps good in spots, that he
couldn't tel! because I wasn't singing
anything only that pitter patter! They
didn't like 'The Fortune Teller' in Lon
don anyway. They like the more deli
cate opera. But I had n. personal success
in it. in fact all the critics were picking
out parts that I ought to sing. They
were perfectly horrified at my flopping
up in the air and dancing a Cakewalk!"
But it was in the line of things that
Mr. Russell should again hear Miss
Nielsen. He came to her this time and
she san? "The King of Thule" for him.
"Then he told me that I ought to give
up comic opera, told me v.-hat he thought
I could perhaps do. and," Alice Nielsen's
little hands clasped themselves here,
"and â oh Lord! I thought, perhaps
here's the man that can help me. All my
life 1 had wanted this thing. But no one,
not one person had wished to elevate me.
They all thought I was good enough
where I was. but all the time I was
wanting, wanting this. I wasn't well
then. In London. And I had about given
up my ambition. And I had no money,
was tired out. was ill, remember. Then
this man took me â you can imagine that
I am grateful."
And' that was theeiid of Alice Niel
sen's comic opera career. She entered
then upon a course of study with Mr.
Russell, of which she speaks as a
priest of his rites. High breathing,
"like Meiba's and Sembrich's," is the
basis of his method, and for eight
weeks she did nothing else.
"After that," she recounts, and
opened her button of a mouth to show
as many of the pearly teeth as it
would, "he asked me to do that and
sing. Ah! There wasn't a sound! I'd
never used the proper vocal muscles."
And she sat there like little Miss
Muffet and talked of the psychological
side of the Russpll method. How she
studied all her roles 'without singing
a note, or rather, "singing them with
my brain." How she used "to hate to
be alone," but how now every mo
ment some new feeling or thought of
song is with her. "It's funny, isn't
it?" she said. "I'm not talking like a
lunatic, am I?"
\u25a0 "I'm listening like one, if you are,"
I encouraged.
Twenty-nine lessons a day Henry
Russell was giving in London, she told
me, and all these the famous teacher
had given up to direct Nielsen's career.
He took her first to Mancinelli to hear
her "voice In the raw." Mancinelli
encouraged. Then came the encour
agement of successful appearances in
Milan. Naples. After that came the
now famous London triumphs. Her
first London grand opera appearances
wero at Covent .Garden, under 'the
ConriPd direction. Here she sang the
Zerlina ('Don Giovanni".) and Su
zanne f"L* Nozze d! Figaro"). But her
teacher thought Miss Nielsen worthy
of bigger things, and himself pave -.a

"The Merchant of Venice." "The Tam
ing of the Shrew" and "Twelfth Night"
will be the new Shakespearean delights
that Julia, Marlowe and E. H. Sothern
will bring to us this seasoriTas they are
now delighting the East. The commenda
tion extraordinary has been bestowed upon
both players in all of their roles. Like
wise, hopefully, much discussion of new
phases of their interpretations has been
aroused. Their "Taming of the Shrew,"
in particular, has been the subject of the
most varied comment. It- is played in
the broadest comedy key, by all account,
and to this some of the more conserva
tive critics have taken active exception.
Migs Marlowe, one of the /foremost
Shakespearean .students in Americaâ or,
for that matter, anywhereâ has taken ex
ception to the exception. Here is her
wise and -witty comment:
"It may well be questioned whether one
who attempts the new; the unexpected In
any department of art should not - abide
by whatever comments the result evokes,
lookirg to another rather than to the
present day. for a. just appreciation. It Is
well known that so eminent -a 'critic as
William Hazlitt was betrayed into the se
rious blunder of grossly denouncing the
intensely tragic Shylock of Edmund Kean
simply because frcm youth he had .only
seen the role interpreted as a comic, gro
tesque, figure, a subject for laughter.
,"Mr. Sothern and myself are In the midst
of an experience parallel^-with that ot
Kean." As far back as one may go "The
Taming of -the Shrew' â ever overdeco
rously enshrined as a classic beneath the
aureole cf the name Shakespeareâ has
been : performed as if it were of classical
comic .fiberâ comparative in dignity and
grace to 'As You Like If or to 'Twelfth
Night.' .Its true fcplrlt has been lost be
cause of the incongruous austerity with
which such performances have clothed it,
and utterly .iway frcm j these renditions
of years past has been theccntral Idea of
its author, who! as a keen theatrical man
ager, wrote this play for ah Elizabethan
audience,-'-'; which he' knew 'only too well
possessed to the full the wild, furious, hi
larious" seiii.o of .Elizabethan farce-come
dy. It is diiÃeult to reconcile the sub
due*]. <;ignifiod. restrained interpretation
of fee playi either? with the text itself or
with the ctinion cf any reputable com
mentators.
"In - a'l v these, such as Fleay, Ward,
Fur ni vail and our own American Furniss.
the invariable sayinsr is that 'this is the
only "oread farce-comedy- with' which
Shakespeare's name 'is connected.* . Why
should -these .admitted authorities in
Shhkespeareana irake so sharp a dis
tinction between the spirit of the 'joyous*
comedies and this palpable farce, unless
the context of the latter demand that it
be given in. a different spirit than the
former? nowever, we rest the justiflca
tion'of our ideas on nothing le3s substan
tial than the authoritative folio edition of
1G23. We. rely on no 'other authority than
Shakespeare's" own text. By this we do
not mean the Booth edition, which was
so cut and altered that it could be played
as an.afterpiece. afterpiece to 'The Merchant of
Venice': .'nor that of the late Augustin
Daly, .which retained the spurious Induc
tion, .deipito' the "fact that it is utterly
unrelateci to . the play proper, but other
v.-ise interpolated . and transposed the
text;, nor â¢ the Winter version, which is
hcjivily. -interlarded with long passages
utterly f.;rcieii to Shakespea.re'9 original
text. Hut we mean the text itself, a? it
roost probably left the' poet's hands and
as it was printed with his stage directions
in the year 1623.
"All we ask of those who disagree with
our interpretation of . the play is to read
the text, and particularly its stage direc
tionâholps-that are very seldom found in
any of the poet's plays. It is our tempo
rary misfortune to be offering our public
the real.text'of Shakespeare, devoid of the
conventionalities and V traditions with
which it! has been incumbered for years;
and to our surprise; many persons have
failed to recognize it. [We have abandoned
a commonly admitted spurious and cer
tainly wholly unrelated .'. Induction; Jwe
havc^given the text absolutely without an
interpolates line^. and we have acted it in
a spirit plainly in accord with the au
thor's stage directions, and with its in
dubitably farcical natureâ but so ingrained
is the Impression : left by former miscon
ceptions," perversions 'and un-Bhakespear
ian Shrews ' that ,we do not ' look - for ; its
universal acceptance and appreciation. /

demonstrate that Katharine was tamed,

those pastel skies. ;
Is the sense of color an index of feel

GRAND OPERA SEASON
TO OPEN AFTER LENT
Charles W. Strine. on behalf of Heinrich
Conried. president and managing director
of th 9 Conried Metropolitan Opera Com
pany, announces that arrangements hÂ«fre
just been completed which will give to
San Francisco the most ambitious season
of grand opera in its musical history.
Th* season will be given by the Conried
Metropolitan Opera Company at the
Grand Opera-house. It will begin on
Easter Sunday. April 16. 1906, and will
continue for two weeks and will include
sixteen performances. Grand operas of
French, German and Italian schools will
be presented in a manner that will admit
of no comparison with any lormer sea
son, save alone the remarkable series of
performances given under Sir. Conried's
direction here last season, the memory of
which is still fresh in the minds of mu
sical San Franciscan*.
Mr. Strine, under whose local manage
ment the San Francisco season will be
given, and whose opinion of San Fran
cisco as the greatest musical city of it*
size in the world, has been vindicated by
the financial and artistic results of other
notable seasons here, says: S|S4
"After much argument I Induced Mr.
Conried and his general business man
ager, Ernest Goerlitz, to consider the
giving of the season which is now ar
ranged for. At the conclusion of the
series of performances In San Francisco
by the Conried Company last spring, I
broached the matter to them, but they
scarcely believed that It was possible to
obtain such results as were then secured
with only a year intervening between the
seasons. I called to their minds my ex
periences with the Melba tour and the
engagement of the Ellis Opera Comparrr
of 1808-90, and likewise the experiences of
Mr. Grau and the Metropolitan Opera
Company in 1900 and 1901.
"San Franciscans will doubtless recall
the fact, then exploited in all the news
papers, that the twelve performances of
the Conried season in 1905 far outclassed
in financial results any series ever given
here. To convince Mr. Conried that an
other season in the spring of ISO 6 was
l'kely to surpass even that astonishin;-,'
result was by no means an easy task.
I finally brought Mr. Goerlitz to my way
of thinking, and "together we then pre
vailed upon Mr. Conried to consider tlu
subject.' It may not be amiss to remind
the people, of this city that the Metropoli
tan opera season in New York covÂ«rs a
period of seventeen weeks. Besides/ thi.<
It includes fourteen performances in Phil
adelphia, only ninety miles away, which
is compelled to put up a very large ca3h
guarantee to induce the Metropolitan im
presario to include that city In his* plans.
"This city, however, has always re
sponded so magnificently to the offering*
of the great opera companies that no
manager has ever had the temerity to
exact or even request a guarantee, not
withstanding that San Francisco Is "over
three thousand miles from New York.
But nevertheless the risk of bringing an
organization of 25J people, including prin
cipals, orchestra, chorus, ballet and me
chanical forces, together with every ac
coutermenÂ£ that goc3 to make up th"
personnel of a grand opera company, a
distance of 5200 miles is a tremendous
undertaking, and only the magnificent
manner in which San Francisco always
responds to such evidences of faith in
her ability to support the greatest of the
world's singing organizations Induced "Mr.
Conried to consider my\ requests for an
other big opera season.
"The particulars of the engagement will
soon be forthcoming. Herr Conried .will
send to the Pacific Coast the greatest as
semblage of artists he has ever cailcd
together. The company will include many
of the famous singers of last year's sea
son, including SJgnor Caruso and also
some renowned strangers. The repertoire
will include the 'Ring' and 'The Queen
of Sheba.' in which the new American
singer. Mine. Rappold, has made such a
hit. The Grand Opera-house management
has co-operated with us to the extent of
renting us their splendid theater and as
In former sessions will contribute all they*
possibly can to the success of thÂ« com
ing one.

Mr. Junior, informs me that as soon as
he can gather together another high-class
collection, , including other names , than
those of, the first .venture, he will go East
again, for there he finds a warm welcome
for. California paintersâ and ready buyers.

ing themselves with a lot. of European

A letter from Walter H. Pritchard.'the
interesting young Irishman who visited
San " Francisco last spring, and who is
now sketching in Tahiti, tells o' the mar
velous scenes in the dark blue caverns of
the' sea, where towering *El Capltans"
rise froni the ' bed of the ocean, beflow
ered "and enfolded .with most marvelous*
growths of kelp and seaweed. Strangely

THE
SEQUOIANS
TWELFTH
NIGHT
SALLY SHARP
\u25a0 ShoÂ»t":d j-cu chance to meet a Sequoian
these days don't stop 'him, or even her.
For it's 10 to 1 that Uie costumer's wait
ing for *a fitting, and the rig; must be
r^ady for the.austero and hypercritical
rye of Amedee Joullin, who as Director
of Costumes must pass judgment upon j
its fitness to enter into the clubs Twelfth
Night Carnival.
As the "Twelfth Night" falls upon Sat
urday next, the anoirnt festival will fill \
the nightâ only until midnight, of course j
âwith fun and good cheer.
The club members must come in some
character of Shakespeare and no dupli
cates will be permitted, lest, indeed. Wil
liam himself has done so. And this un
interesting duplication is to be avoided
by a clever scheme of the committee, to
n horn every secret must be confided, and
in time for emendations.
The committee having the affair in
charge is made up as follows: Mrs. Flor
ence Porter PfingFt '.chairman*. William
CJrcer Harrison, Mrs. Elizabeth Gerber
â¢3ing, Mrs. Linda H. Bryan. Royden Wil- j
iiamson. Barnett Franklin and Charles
H. Lombard, secretaryâ a thrice busy lot
of folk, urho will make the thing "go" if
from no other impetus than that of their
own personalities.
It has been whispered about that there's j
been a suspicious run upon the male
characters whose garb permits of long,
flowing robes. But one thing is certain,
there are some Sequoians whose anatomy
wtU permit of the tights of the Renais
s-ance. as revealed in the recent "Mer
chant of Venice." But Saturday night
will tell the whole beautiful story.
Why, bless them, they all â or nearly all
âwant to be queens. Or else nuns.
Aside from the fun the club Is gettingâ
nnd will getâ out of the thing, it has an
olucatiunaJ value that wasn't reckoned
with.
For it's a safe g:\mble that those Se
quoia people know more about the Bard
of Avon now than when they started out
to find a character they wantedâ and that
>.jinc other fellow hadn't pre-empted.
The festival promises to be the gayest
thins the club has ever done, aided and
abetted by the artist element in it wTfich

Who will forget the ball la.=t year at th>;
St. Francis, in honor of .Miss Anita? And
now comes the home dance at the Broad

vleve, quite the smartest affair of the
week in town.
Miss Genevleve is a thoughtful looking
maid, of. ; rather good height and more
picturesque in style than hcr'sister, who
affects severe and classic lines of garb.
Both are distinctly smart looking.
5 Speaking of debutantes, somehow they
don't seem to be so very gay at affairs
given in their honor. The married belles
capture most of the attentionâ such of it
as the bachelor, maids leave. So the poor
little debutante oftc>n looks as if she
would rather be home in bed.
But let her be consoled.
Some day she'll. be a married belle, or a
bachelor maid, j "1 VJ

SOME PROMISES
WITH THE CASH
Money and Notes Will Be
Offered to the Creditors
of Mitchell This Week
MEETING OX TUESDAY
Committee Now Has the
Books and Finds Liabil
ities to Be About $100,000
When the creditors of R. Brent Mitchell
assemble next Tuesday they will receive
an offer of settlement, partly in cash and
in part by notes. Such is the statement
made yesterday by John A. Percy, Mitch
ell's attorney. The amount of money to be
paid and the amount to be represented
by notes 4s not made public by the attor
ney. Strong efforts are being made to
raise coin that the percentage of cash
may be as large as possible.
Attorney Percy also says that Mitchell
will possibly have Indorsed notes to* cover
the balance due when the cash payment
is made.
Yesterday the books and accounis of
Mitchell were handed over to the commit
tee of the creditors, George Mastlck, A.
P. Welch and Captain Burnham. As the
figures are based on estimates of the val
ues of stocks upon the closing on Tuesday
last in New York some consideration of
the real liabilities may be necessary. The
committee, su Mr. Mastick says, will de
vote three days to looking Into Mitchell's
matters, aided by what Is revealed by the
books. Since the first meeting of the
creditors, which was fully and exclusive
ly reported by The Call, Mitchell has sup
plied information that will be of assist
ance to the committee in reaching conclu
sions for a report to the creditors. The
liabilities are in the neighborhood of $100,
000, as originally reported. No exact fig
ures are given out.
The larger creditors are represented by
lawyers. Smaller creditors have received
letters from the committee asking their
pleasure. Some curiosity, has been occa
sioned by an advertisement that has been
inserted in The Call which reads as fol
lows: \

Then ITakeV Settlement
Although the California State "building
that stood at the Portland Exposition as
a representative of mission: architecture
In this State has been sold to Lafe Pence
for $300, as: was recorded In the press dis
patches : yesterday, the : controversy over
the structure, . that has been' hot at times,
is; not ended yet. : In fact. Governor Par
dee has decided that the situation justifies
his taking a hand in- the future proceed
ings.
When the contract was let to the Bur
rill Construction Company the contract
price was fixed. The Portland -Exposition
management compelled the California
commissioners /to change the plans. The
size of the building was curtailed, be
cause the commissioners .were not allowed
to cut a tree^that stood where the.build
ing was to. be. placed in part, and a regu
lation regarding, the distance that the
buildings must be from avenues also
caused . another departure from the lines
originally laid down. Then the commls
sioners.came to the conclusion that cer
tain architectural features' in the interior
could, be ' dispensed with, \u25a0 and other
changes galore followed. \u25a0
>Out of these conditions came a contro
versy ..with the contractors, that has re
sulted in the failure of the' contractors to
get their money. The commissioners are
winding: up their affairs, and.it is neces
sary, that something shall be done to ad
just the building matter. In this view of
the case Governor Pardee has decided to
call in William Veltch, a contractor and
builder. Veitch. with Commissioner Filch

fornia building before it is torn'down and
examine it for the purpose of submitting
a final report. "vMiX-r^ij^

BREAST CANCER
KILLS MOTHER
Two Sisters and Uncle
Cured Without Knife
or Pain!
Mrs. Elizabeth McClure of 1503 Y z
Market street, San Francisco. Cal.. lost
her mother about a year ago after a
surgical operation for a lump in her
breast. Mrs. McClure and her sister
each had aÂ» large lump in her breast,
which became a poisonous, eating can-
cer. Fearing they would die as did
their mother, they refused operation.
'.<. Hearing of Mrs. Crosthwaite's (954
Arlington avenue, Oakland, Cal.) re-
markable cure without knife or pain by
a wonderful Pacific island plant ex-
tract, each sister, and also an uncle, haa
cancers, cured within the same month,
and, -strangely, without one telling the
other. These noted cancer specialists,
who discovered and use this remedy,
cure hundreds of cancers that no one
but themselves and the patients ever
know about. They charge nothing un-
tir cured and offer $1000 if they fail.
The cures are made in the privacy of
the patient's own home.
Dr. and Mrs. Dr. Chamley & Co. are
the doctors .who cured Mr. E. J.
(Lucky) Baldwin of Arcadia. Cal.. of
three cancers, just three years ago,
after X-Ray had made him much worse.
Other physicians thought he could not
be.'curod and would die in a few
months. His testimony in his own
words iF in Dr. Chamley's book, which
is rhe best ever published on cancers.
It contains proof that any lump in wo-
man's breast Is cancer, also" that any
tumor, lump or sore on the lip, face or
anywhere is cancer.
Dr. Chamley is declared by his pa-
tients to be one of the most honest, sin-
cere and kind-hearted doctors they ever
knew. He is the best authority in
America on the cure of cancers, having
cured more in thirty-three years than
any other doctor living.

Change Will Permit the Construction
of Wooden SUlewnJk* <Â»n Streets;
In .Ma nuf act urlns District.
The Board of Public Works yester
day completed the draft of an amend
ment to the ordinance regulating the
construction of sidewalks so . that
wooden walks may be laid on streets
in the manufacturing district near tho
water front.
The traffic of teams going in and out
of the yards is so great that it is im
practicable â to lay. permanent stone
sidewalks in the district named. The
amended ordinance will permit prop
erty owners to lay wooden walks, but
they will be compelled to keep tha
walks in repair.
. Grand; Jury Foreman Mitchell .com
plained to the board that a property
owner on Clay street, between Cherry
and Maple, â¢ bad commenced to lay a.
bitumen sidewalk in front of his prop
erty despite the fact that a resolution
of intention hud been passed by the
board authorizing the construction of
stone sidewalks in the block. As the
property . owner had acted without a
permit Officer Beach was detailed to>
stop the work. The bitumen already
laid will be ordered torn up and stone
sidewalks substituted.

PRACTICAL EDUCATION.
THE addresses and discussions during the recent meeting of the
State Teachers* Association have covered the whole field of edu
cation, but have left its great problem unsolved. Industry is a
habit of body and mind. "Without that habit, education is of no
value. Self-support depends upon industry. The studious habit aikl
the habit of manual industry are not the same. It is claimed by
practical observers that when schooling occupies the time up to the
end of the 'teens the plastic period for acquiring a trade or bread
winning vocation has gone by. The co-ordination of brain and hand
must begin earlier..
When a youth becomes a man at twenty-one he should be equip
ped for self-support, whether that be an immediate necessity or not.
The question is, if his total nonage has been spent in school, is he so
equipped. The answer is that he is not. The average man . must
have acquired habits of thrift and industry before his majority, for
only the man above the average will acquire them afterward. Gov
ernor Pardee spoke forcibly of the need of discipline, and seemed
to seek it in prolonging attendance at school. Xo discipline, no
training in ethics or morals, can overcome the effect of physical
idleness. Proper and wholesome work, directed to auseful end, and
with a definite purpose, is the best safeguard for morals and virtue
that can be found. It is the foundation of good citizenship, the key
to independence.
. The school curriculum needs to be unloaded of matter that
merely seems to occupy the time, and should be devoted to sound
acquisition of the fundamentals of an education. This should be
with the purpose of releasing the pupil in his nonage, to the end
that the energies and ambitions of youth may be devoted to the
selection and acquisition of a calling, trade, vocation, that will yield
self-support and lead to independence.
It is observed that in cities, where first-class trade or polytech
nic schools are part of the public school system, with attendance
optional and counting as part of the regular grades, nearly all pupils
of both sexes known in the regular grades as careless, inattentive
and indisposed to keep up with their classes, given the option, select
the polytechnic course. Having been in school from the age of five
to'fourteen, they have wearied of it and want something to do. with
their, hands. They hate the regular course, are dilatory in attend
ance and infect others, to the injury of discipline. Now this is"
usually treated by school officials as contumacy. It has caused the
enactment of compulsory education laws, the appointment of truant
officers with police powers, and has created a semi-penal environ
ment for the public schools.
X deeper insight into its cause suggests the better remedy of- the
polytechnic school, with its complete equipment for learning all of
the leading trades and handicrafts, and the domestic, household arts.
In such a school, with optional courses, boys are trained to be good
mechanics, with sufficient book knowledge to fit them for superior
positions, and girls are trained for the grateful duties that make
good wives and mothers. All this can be done by recognizing the
unrest, inattention, indifiference and rebellion to discipline of the
classroom as natural, as the desire for manual activity, the prompt
ing toward "doing something," and not as the result of a vicious
disposition.
Mr. John Swett, who modestly describes himself as -a horticul
turist when among school teachers, and a school teacher when
among horticulturists, in his "address to the State Teachers' Associa
tion on the teaching of agriculture in the schools, advised the op
tional course, by projecting nature study toward agriculture as an
art. He advised wherever practicable the schoolhouse garden, where
cadi pupil may have a small plat in charge and have under his con
trol a miniature farm. This is not feasible in school lots in cities,
but even there city school boards can buy or rent ground for such
purpose, or an area within the children's playgrounds, which are
becoming popular adjuncts to city schools, may be set aside for a
garden.'
Mr. Swett, who has supplemented a long and successful career
as a school teacher by an equally successful career as a horticulturist,
gave some good advice to farmers, that they give their boys colts to
raise, or cattle, and their girls an interest in the poultry yard.
In each case this induces a study of the animals, their keep and
training, and it develops that property-getting instinct which is an
incentive to honest industry/,
We" are persuaded that if due attention be given to industrial,
education, the moral results will be more satisfactory than now.
The nature that is in each child will have its diverse longings satis
fied, and the country will get the full results that it has the right
to expect from the education of its people. Mr. Swett, drawing
upon his long experience as a teacher, advised parents to go visiting
the school oftener. If farmers would make it a point to visit the
country school and talk to the children in the plainest way about
their work, good results would follow.. So, in cities, if master
mechanics, shipbuilders, bankers and merchants would go to the
schools and tell what they know about their business, it would aid
in giving a practical turn to education.
Finally, The Call has to suggest that the valuable work of the
school garden may be encouraged by the Agricultural Department,
by the annual distribution of seeds to the schools, instead of wasting
seed by the method now followed. Congressmen get the seeds and
send them out haphazard. Let every country schoolteacher write
to the Congressman for the district foj seeds for the school garden
and then ask the farmers to direct the planting.
EXTENT OF NATIONAL IRRIGATION.
SECRETARY of the Interior Hitchcock's report shows a rapid
progress of Government reclamation of arid lands. The ex
tent of the plans which are now approved is so great that the
figures will astonish many people. Already projects are sanctioned
which when completed will reclaim 1,303,600 acres and the great
sum of $37,000,000 will be spent upon the irrigation works needed
for trfis purpose. In the allotments as now made California holds
third place on the list in the amount of funds, namely $3,000,000
for the Yuma project, which will reclaim 85,000 acres. The biggest
sum will be used in Arizona, $3,850,000, on the Salt River irriga
tion works. Nevada gets for the Truckee-Carson project an equal sum
to Yuma. The second biggest sum goes to Nebraska and Wyoming,
on the North Platte. the amount being $3,330,000, and its water is
to fertilize 100.000 acres.
Although Texas was not included in the terms of the original
act, even she is now assured of being benefited by the Government's
general plan. An act of last February gave her some aid, and now
it is expected that she will get more, as President Roosevelt has
advised it. Recently Secretary Hitchcock has approved the Rio"
Grande reclamation plan for Texas and New Mexico. This admis
sion of Texas into the benefits completes the nationalization of the
reclamation plan, for the Lone Star State was at first shut out
because she differed from all the other States in that she owned
her public lands and never turned them over to the Federal Gov
ernment when she entered the Union.
The work is so far forward that seventy-seven miles of main
canals have been constructed,' while distributing canals and ditches
to the length of 240 miles and three and a half miles of ..'tunnels
are done. Though the first work is confined chiefly to where. there
is extreme aridity of climate, there will be a dozen or more States
which will be largely helped by this assistance of the General Gov
ernment. The recent report of Secretary of Agriculture Wilson
gave some figures about the increase in the value of American farms
which would seem incredible did they "not come from so authorita
tive a source, and now when we try, to think of the addition
this jreat reclamation project is sure to add to the sum of farmers'

ROOSEVELT IN THE RING
IT was a bout to decide the light
weight championship of . Harvard.
The heavy-weight and middle
weight championships had been
awarded. The contest for; the men un
der 140 pounds was on. Roosevelt, then
a junior, had defeated seven men. A
senior had as many victories to his
credit. They were pitted against each
other in the finals. : The senior .was
quite a bit taller than Roosevelt, I and
his reach was longer. He also -weighed
more by six pounds, but Roosevelt was
the quicker man on his feet, and knew
more -of the science of boxing. The
first round . was vigorously contested.
Roosevelt closed in at the very outset.
Because,, of his bad eyes he realized
that in-fighting gave him his only
chance', to win. / Blows .vere exchanged
with lightning rapidity, and they were
hard blows. Roosevelt drew first blood,
but soon his own nose was bleeding.
At the call of time, however, he got tho
decision for the round.
The senior had learned his lesson.
Thereafter he would not permit Roose
velt to close in on him. With his longer
reach and aided by his .antagonist's
near-sightedness, he succeeded in land
ing frequent blows. Roosevelt worked
hard, but to no avail. The round was

NEW YORK'S MONEY MARKET.
'-p* HE recent flurry in New York, which sent call money up above
I ioo per cent, was not caused by any lack of .moneys for legiti
\u25a0*â¢ mate daily business. The demand was caused by the necessi
ties of speculation. It was a bull market for stocks, in anticipation
of the January dividends, and margin's had to be covered, even; if
the money cost above ioo per; cent. Such a condition of the market
has been almost always associated with a panic that became general.
That this is not the case now is due to the soundness, of our finances
and the stability of legitimate or non-speculative^ business
Some papers have criticized the Secretary of the Treasury for
not coming to the rescue by releasing treasury funds. Secretary
Shaw is an experienced banker. He knows the difference between
speculative distress â¢â and the stress of the , regular business' of the
country, and so sees no necessity of opening the: Federal? Treasury
to pay margins on stocks. Unless the matter spread, to the peril of
the regular business of the country, the Secretary will let the spec
ulators take care ; of themselves. The money that will be; released
by the semi-annual . dividend ; day, next week, will put the market in
its normal condition again.
An interesting incident of the: flurry was furnished by '-Russell
Sage. He 'is; in his ':9lst year, and had been for Sometime housed at
home-by illness. But when the market .'-.went kiting he ; could hot
resist the temptation to turn an honest 1 peiiny. Leaving his 'bed he
went to his downtown office and remained three hours, and ; duririÂ« :
that time loaned $30,000,000 at over 100 per cent. The History of
finance furnishes . no. parallel to this. The old- man, with evervi

awarded to the senior. . In the third
round the senior endeavored to pursue
the same tactics, but with less. success.
The result' of this round was a draw
and an' extra round had to be sparred.
Here superior weight and longer reach
began to tell, but Roosevelt boxed
gamely to. the "end. Said his antag
onistânow known by the pen name of
"Niblick"r "I can see . him now as lie
came in fiercely to the attack. But I
kept him off, taking no chances, and
landing at long reach. I got the deci
sion; but Roosevelt was far more scien
tific. Given good eyes he would have
defeated mo easily." - ;;"'
The defeated man . did not forget his
conqueror. Many years after,' when Mr.
Roosevelt was Governor of New. York,
the two met on a railroad train. Out
went Mr. Roosevelt's hand as he greet
ed his old antagonist heartily. After
the usual inquiries .as to health, the

MAKING MARRIED LIFE HAPPY
To the Editor of The Call.
.Angela Morgan says in The Call un
der date of December 26 that a'husband
protests that she is not fair to the men
in laying upon them the blame for lack
of romance in married life.
I agree with the husband to a certain,
extent. I speak from experience and
observation, ' but we must go farther
back than married life. Most of tho
unhappiness in married life might be
averted if the courtship is properly
carried on. Mothers are responsible for
nearly all of the tears and heartburn
ings of their daughters after marriage.
A sensible mother generally rears sen
sible daughters and will being ap : her
girls to .workâ that is, to understand
thoroughly the ins and outs of ' house
keeping, and those duties must be per
formed :and learned by .;. actual, experi
ence. It is' too common, a' custom of
to-day for a . mother to jdo the washing,
ironing, cooking and every kind of
housework that is . absolutely neces
sary to make a happy home.

beauty, her; accomplishments, her taste
in dress and all ; that,. but if she is not
a good cook and housekeeper there will

in the- country, or any man that works
for a living. He marries ) and settles
down. ' His main object in , life ; is ,to
provide for the home; he has estab

will do the work, I don't want you to look
shabby." When John comes he never
sees his .etheart except when she is
dressed up and looking her prettiest.
After they are married, of course, a
woman cannot always be looking so
sweet and dainty. But the, young man
notices the change; whereas, if the girl
had gone- on with her work she would
have been just as much admired and they
would have been better acquainted.
. Another thing responsible for family
jars is the money question. To my mind,
if is absurd to hear a woman say: "I have
to ask my husband . for every cent I
need." Now imagine two men going Into
partnership and one asking the other for
money. There is nothing that will make a
woman more economical and saving than
for her husband to have implicit confi
dence in her judgment as to what they
can afford to spend. She appreciates the
trust he places in her and will \u25a0 strive to
save- and thereby win his love and ap
proval. A man has more respect, for a
woman \that encourages his efforts and
schools herself to understand . the prob
lem of making a living, considering her
self - his ; equal ... in all matters. It is
man's place to provide, but it is woman's
place -to care for the home and see to it
that- nothing is ; wasted. It is woman's
nature to wish to be admired and loved,
and that . Is as it should be, but If the
husband does neglect sometimes to say
sweet nothings let it pass. When a hus
band says he has never seen a woman
that can make a house look so sweet and
cozy as ; you do and he is alwayaj more
pleased to" come home than to go any
where , else, he is satisfied he is paying
you; the greatest compliment that a man
can pay. A sullen, fretful face will drive
a man to the saloon sometimes. Culti
vate-cheerfulness if you desire a happy
home. :;>;r MRS. C. W. LAWSON.

IN THE LAND
OF THE CZAR
IX REFLATING an Interview with a.
Russian official, in his article.
"Russian Peasant Riots," in the
January Everybody's. Ernest Poolo
says: .
"The Chancellor smiled.
" 'Not long 1 ago,' he replied, 'a gen
tleman came here with just such a
letter. But meanwhile thy Governor
had received different orders frora
seme one else In Petersburg. The
gentleman did not see the peasants."
â¢â¢ 'Let's get out of this.* I said, speak
ing low in English. 'Let's hire a
slai-^h and just begin looking as we
did in those other villages. At least
we can see something before we gee
expelled.*
"Unfortunately the Chancellor
caught my meaning.
" 'If you try to see the peasants by
yourselves,' he said, "you will not only
be watched by the police, but some at
least of the peasants to whom you talk
will be our spies. We have telephones
to every village and in two hours at
latest we shall know not only whom
you have seen, but also what you
yourselves have said. Meanwhile you
will have been seized and thrown Into
a village jail, awaiting our orders.'
He smiled grimly. 'Our village police
ara rough fellows. They would doubt
less flog you both in jail before we
could inform t*hem who you were. OC
course, we should be sorry for this
and should reprimand them. But in
the meantime you see you would have
been flogged.' "
HOPE OF AMERICA.
An X editorial in the January Century
suggests that we are deteriorating in our
demagogues, but points out grounds of
hope for America's future:
It is to be feared that in the future
the dangers from the demagogues in
American politics is perhaps greater than
ever. I{ sometimes looks as if we were
dÂ«te*iprating as to the character of our
demagogues, as if some even of our de
cent citizens were willing to advance the
fortunes of politicians of more disreputa
ble record, of more vlndictiveness la their
methods, of more loathsome cant and
hypocrisy and of more evil influence, than
have hitherto been able to make good
men their dupes. In every community
there is crying need of men, young and
old, who will take a hand in civic con
cerns, not for the graft that is in them,
not merely for the glory that is in them,
but in a pure and patriotic spirit and with
the love of and the reward of legitimate
fame. Our institutions are making such
men; two bright examples are now living
and greatly honored among usâlnspira
tions to all. One of these men has been
the President of our country, and one is
now its President. The country that has
found and used and honored such men is
capable of producing more of the same
fiberâ and. in fact. Is doing so before our
eyes. In this is the hope of Amertea.
LONGEVITY AND LIQUOR
It has come to be generally recognized
as a fact that the alcohot habit Is one
of the main factors in determining length
of life. Figures furnished by insurance
companies in England show that the aver
age life of the total ab/Â»ralner is nine
years longer than that of ihe drinker, and
one of our own concerns in the same line
of business, the Equitable, has published
a statement to the effect that the death
rate, among "moderate" consumers of
liquor is 23 per cent higher than among
teetotalers. Some of the companies on
both sides of the water, indeed, put ab
stainers in a separate class among their
policy-holders, making them a special al
lowance of 5 per cent or more on pre
miums.âPearson's Magazine.

"The. Mysterious* Stranger and Other
Cartoon*.* by John T. McCutcheon. He
Is a cievÂ«r and very versatile cartoon
ist. When our President goes on a
bunting holiday he makes us see the
sport and. laugh food naturedly over
the tremendous^ sftrenuousnes^s of the
chase; when the sentimental time of
s;>ring comes round he shows us how the
under pa&sfon moves the schoolboy and
sets us amusedly musing upon ho*'
very early nature begins to work upon
rfcan through the influences of the eter
nal feminine; when the most powerful
. of autocrats makes a mistake that
causes his vaVt empire to Wfter with
weakness he shows us the" why of the
< atastrophe with a few strokes of his
i*>noil; when the good Pope' Leo XIII
nied the sure touch of the master car
toonist expressed the catholicity "of the
world's mourning by drawing a band
of rrape around the globe.
The drawings in this collection were
originally published in the. Chicago Tri
bune and the Chicago Record-Herald,
and art reprinted in book form by per
mission of those publishers. There is
generous room for the pictures for the
pages are 9x12. and it is generously
thick, too. for the author pictorially
tells a great number of stories. The
full page picture called "Another Mys
iÂ«-riou^ Stranger"' shows Oyama in the
act ot stepping upon a pedestal, which
i? added to a long line of them occu
pied b*y the worlds greatest military
geniuses from Alexander to Napoleon.
Kuropatkin, with gesture of astonish
ment, staros at the sudden stepping up
of this- addition, and in his hand he
holds a. broken fragment of a sword.
Roosevelt's hunting calls forth much of
the cartoonist's most enthusiastic work.
The book opens with one of these named,
"A Quiet Day," and in it the President,
leaving a collection of slaughtered wolves,
'.cars and cougars scattered along his
'.tail, hurries forward, shooting cougars
lrorn trees with a revolver held in his
light hand, while the same hand grasps
the rod that is catching speckled trout
from the river; his left hand seizes a
coyote by the tail; his right foot kicks a,
grizzly bear, back-broken, high in the air;
hie left foot crushes the life out of a
rattlesnake; and ahead of him more
lierce beasts are fleeing. In other places
when he trees the bears they are clus
tered upon the limbs like prunes lade the
twigs in a Santa Clara orchard; and
when a news item states that "the Presi
dent has been on the trail of a grizzly for
four days." the way McCutcheon shows
the tracks of that trail coming from far,
forty-nine miles away across the snowy
mountains and Teddy close to the tail of
th* terrified grizzly, the man ' with one
knife in his hand and another In his
lr^th. hat In his hand and his bare brow
beaded with the big sweat ot four days'
firenuous stride, and the galloping bear
with nig tongue-hung-out exhaustion and
eye* astart with horror, is a thing, once
you have seen it, to be remembered hap
pily ever after.
A good story told in a series of pictures
is that of "A Schoolboy in Springtime."
The little fellow site dolefully on the
doorsteps and four comical looking dogs
watch his attitude and expression with
puzzled wonder. He is in love with a
little girl who, unfortunately for < him.
but most fortunately for another follow,
is giving h<>r attention to that other fel
low. The doleful boy iy not yet altruistic
enough to rejoice in the fact that the
good thing is not altogether lost, although
himself docs not get the girL He tays to
himself. "Every time I think of her I
have the queerest kind of feeling, kind o'
like a painless stomach ache, only not so
much. I wonder why?" Next picture he
meets his inamorata all alcne but for his
presence, and there with hand on heart
protests his adoration. And oh, my, the
expressions on the faces of the demure
maiden and the precocious ewaln who
fwfars, "Honest, cross my heart, you're
the first girl I ever said it to." Last
Hcene of all that ends this eventful
story; the little girl is going off with the
other fellow, and the unfortunate left
one muses sadly leaning upon a post, and
v.ith an expression masterfully conceived
Â«n<3 cartooned, which the four dogs at
tentively consider with their heads held
'\u25a0o one side, as eagerly listening dogs are
wont to do. The words they hear are
these: "Some day she'll be sorry she,
\u25a0 rÂ«:n(.d me this away. I'll go 'way and
isnke lots o* money end come back here
rif iing in a carriage with four white
horse*, and when she tries to catch my !
<> f - I'll pertend I never s&en.her before."!
This cleverly, cartoonly toJd story will i
remin.l many men that "we are but chll- !
dr*>n of a larger growth.*" j
IndÂ«'f-ii we wonder if that man ever j
was who never at some time wanted!
Bfinc woman or girl he couldn't get. i
Perhaps Cartoonist McCutcheon was I
thinking philosophically of this prob
able fact when he did this study on
mankind in miniature; und maybe he
was mus-ins; as he pushed the pencil
that providence was dealing eently I
with the boy when his training began â¢
ever so early to teach him to do with- j
out the feminine his fancy craves if J
fate decrees he cannot ha\e her; for so. I
peradventure. shall he when grown
to manhood be saved from that sullen
hearted inability to feel "unjcalous joy
m Joys not made for us," which so of
fen makes suicide- of the weak, and, of
the coarsely strong, snatchers of sub
stitutes. /
Strongest of all the cartoons in this
book are the ones which deal with Rus-,
*ian affaiis. Some of these.* though
A BOOK OF CLEVER
CARTOONS; AND SOME OTHERS
done in the past, are very pertinent to
the present, because of Russia's still
horrible predicament. There Is one
which depicts the Czar seated dejected
ly upon a block of ice in the streets of
SL Petersburg, The whiskered man
has a boy's toy with him. The toy is a
house set on wheels and with a string
so the Czar can pull it around and play
with it. There is a flag flying on top
of the toy with this legend, "The
Hague Peace Tribunal." On the wall
behind him is this placard fn large let
ters: "LOST â At the Winter Palace,
Sunday, January, 22. ONE GOLDEN
OPPORTUNITY to win the confidence
and gratitude of my people and the re
spect of the. world. â Nicholas the 2d."
.When it is remembered that this was
the date of the Czar's cowardly re
fusal to come out and reply personally
to the liumble petition made by the
workmen with suci. a pathetic .appeal
.for his personal consideration as a still
beloved and trusted sovereign, and also
the date of the slaughter of the. peti
tioners, we can get the force of the
Cartoon. It is a cartoon that keeps
well and is as valuable to-day as on
the date it was uttered. Another one
\u25a0of like import and power is" of the
"Hague Peace Tribunal," showing this
building with all the signs of vacancy
and untenanted neglect. The windows
smashed, cobwebs over the door and
the big placard, "For Rent," hanging
upon it. It is a biting satire on the
fact .that the Czar led !n the establish
ment of this peace tribunal and took
t"he wlory of the deed to himself, and
then was the first to refuse to obey the
great principle for which it stood. The
picture contains the further sarcasm
upon Russian delinquency in the sign
which shows up from a wall near The
.Hague Tribunal. It says "Vodka â
khat's. all.' That play up^n the well
known advertisement of a brand of
whisky is at once a stroke at the cor-
Tuptjon of .Russian autocrats in com
mand and at the incompetence of . the
Russian soldiers in the field of battle.

&N APPRECIATION OF
BOOKS AS COMPANIONS
A book about boa'is, when it is written
by'an ardent and diseriminatinc appre
ciator of those treasures, is nearly always
one which -we w}s!t not merely to ,rea.d
but to make a permanent possessions so
that when we half remember something
that one time pleased our fancy we can
.quickly lay our hand upon the where its
other half Is and thus wholly bring that
pkasure back. Such a good one "for
keeps'' Is "The Companionship of Books
and Other papers," by Frederick Row
land Marvin. Save for the first essay
in the collection of papers which gives
its title to the volume the work is not
so much about books as about interesting
bits that have been culled from books.
The papers were written in an environ
ment which lent all the aower of literary
atmosphere to the charm of their "com
position, for the author, whose home is
m .Albany. N. V.. has a library of more
than 4<*XÂ» rare and costly volumes, many
of which are presentation and extra
illustrated copies and tirst editions. In
company as that if the author has
lovingly examined his treasures, and none
can doubt that Marvin has, the writing
of papers is apt to be done with literary
excellence.
One of these papers is called "Chips
From a Literary Workshop." All of
these chips are quite small, but of fine
grain, so as to be worth picking up to
admire the texture. In one of them the
author takes good-natured issue with
Professor Park, who said that "style Is
only the frame to hold our thoughts."
Marvin says that style is not the opaque
sash, but the transparent glass which
transmits the pure light of thought. "The
value of an attractive style is best shown
by the significant fact that he who de
cries it must do so in the very style
he decries. or go without readers." Here
is one of these chips, which, though it is
very tiny, has value enough to be worth
picking up and taking , note of: "None
are so old as they who have outlived en
thusiasm."
The short paper on Hafiz, "the Prince
of Persian ooets," has some favorable in
terpretations of that songful believer in
the philosophy of joy. Marvin tells us of
the legend that Zikhr, the Mohammedan
Elijah, brought Haliz a draught from the
fountain of living water; but Marvin
thinks it is more believable that the Per
sian's genius was nursed upon wine from
the warm breasts of the grape. This poet
of "love, wine, flowers and beauty" is
said to have lived a life that illustrated a
famous motto over a sundial:- "Horas
non numero nisi serenas. He counted
none but the cloudless hours." He hated
cant in both love and religion. It must
be admitted that some of his lines seem
to preach the throwing away 'of all re
ligion for the snke of the joy of loving.
In the midnicht of thy locks
I renounce the day; â¢ t ,
In the rlnt or thy rosy lips
My h<-art forjcfcUi to pray.
Marvin warns us we must not mis
take Ila.fiz lor a mere sensualist. The
following expressions of judgment on
that subject are doubly Interesting
from the fact .nat Marvin is the pastor
of a Christian church:'
"If his songs and philosophy under
rained the faith of his age and Country,
it is clear to us, and was to many of his
own time, that the destruction was in
the interest of truth. He exalted
health, gladness, nature and humanity
over superstition, disease and brood
ing melancholy. â¢ â¢' â¢ He was a
child of the sun and all his songs were
sunbeams. He seized^ upon the com
mon experiences of mankind and upon
the most trivial objects and glorified
them with new spirit and recreative
genius. Even the \u25a0 wildest drinking
songs and most amorous verses have
this redeeming feature. The world is
richer and better for nearly every line
it has received from the^ lovely and
health bestowing Haflz." ' |
Here is the way Oriental thought
makes romance out of the most ordi
nary passion:
Thtt ohcinint of }ova
Will this perishing mold.
Were It made out of mire. '
Transmute into gold.
The paper that will be of widest in
terest is the one concerning that fam
i ous modern philippic, the "Father
' Damien Letter," written by Robert
i Louis Stevenson. That letter is * one of
' the most brilliant ever written, and Is
! perhaps the most brutal thing: that
Stevenson ever did. The consideration
of it is a study at once in literature, In
morals and in psychology. It ls^sald
that there is reason to believe that
Stevenson In after: years regretted the
letter and would gladly have recalled
it ' had that been possible. "
In a paper called "Success" this lover
of books and owner of a treasure of a
library gives to authors who are some-

A BOOK THAT BRINGS
v STEVENSON TO MIND
If you like stories that are written in a
style , that will strongly remind you of
Robert Louis Stevenson's work, then
there is a treat In store for you if you will
read "Lgsct's Luck." Another very good
reason fur reading it is that it Is written
by a promising new California author.
Charles Tenncy Jackson. . A third reason
is that it is the work of a man who went
through considerable stress Â«jf misfortunes
and losers' luck before h,e found success;
not that misfortune of itself makes Inter
est, but the talent that passes through it
unweakened and unspoiled is usually
purged and tempered by the test which
makes the mettle of it ring with a quality
not otherwise attained: All. can easily
understand, too, that In .such a case,
when a bock is favorably, received by the
public, the success will be more keenly
appreciated by the workman. .The test
readers of the manuscript, who' examined
it for the publishers, Henry Holt & Co.,
were delighted with the story, and very
confident if its success.
Charles *Tenney Jackson made his first
success in literary work by winning ouie
of the fifty-dollar prizes which were . of
fered by The Call for abort' stories. After
that he won other, prizes, and has 'devel
oped his "talent for fiction, until now he
has executed this comparatively; long
story, which makes a bcok of 327 pages,
which promises to be a success. The story
starts from San Francisco Bay, .and' the
start-off is with a fine dash, which draws
the reader at once into rapport . '.with \h&
writer. The first scene is lon board a
tnasr-ificently swift pleasure yacht which
h< lying on the bayâ all' ready equipped
for a voyage". The owner, Stevenson, has
insfusted the details of preparation
wholly to the ship's master, old Mendez,'
a Central' Ametiean.^ The yachts-n ame

tc-nant of the Marine Corps the "boat,; is

and ', can jfive no . explanation ' to 'â¢ the
cer. Suddenly/ whUe they; are; discussing
the mystery, . they hear a row, on ; deck,i
and In a few ' minutes .find'^ themselves
prisoners of a crew of roughs who have
btcn h'rtid to i; seize the j. yacht and" - sail
away to Central America to aid In a rev
olution.
."From the deck \u25a0 came cries, the rattle
of ; ha-vsers, 'â¢ the quick ourst of a sail;
then the surge of the yacht's bows as her
great boom swung to port. She gathered
herself; she leaped from -the anchorage;
there came the. smart epatter of waves
against v her steel plates."
They are chased by a United States
cruiser, but outrace her,- and Stevenson,
who loves his yacht better than he loves
anything on earth, better even than he
"loves women, took a reckless satisfaction
in : the speed of his pet. He'd -rather re
main prisoner than see his favorite beaten
in- a: sailing, contest..,' So they "watched
the white cruiser, which had come out of
San Francisco harbor and was surging
south with a bone" in her teeth . and^Axn

In brief space. There is a pleasing one
called "The Cloud," of .which I give you:
the first stanza :
A cloud across the sunset -sky. .
A -single cloud, swings -slowly by:
So distant, yet- so bright. . it seems
"A.Bhip' upon theazure. deep, â¢\u25a0; 'â¢
A sail upon the sea <of sleep, â¢ '
The fancy freighted bark of dreams:
y- Oh, silver boat on 'shoreless blue! . ,
â¢ My soul would . passase take with you,
An<l sail and seek, through sunlit air,
"Its". Paradise of . PÂ«ace somewhere!
:, A .very ' pretty, passing , thought, swiftly
expressed, is this: ,' t
THE ABALONK." i
I saw a rainbow. â¢ for \u25a0an instant, . Kleam, '
On the vext edge of a receding swell;
,The - next . soft surge, -,' .> '. |

Swept to my feet an abalone shell;
It was ' the ; rainbow ; I had eeen - before.
There Is a : short j poem ; called "Success
and . Failure",' that ;. I* so ; fine in , thought
and expression that the mood In which the
author : was: when he wrote it must have
been ' inspired -\bv .getting .fully into his
soul some of Browning's magnanimous
philosophy. One to the California poppy
is worthy of that golden Bower. It closes
so:

Type of the treasured wealth untolJ.
Of the rich desire and the deep unrest.
Of the glorious, garlanded, golden west!
The "Legend of the Organ Rock" at
Monterey Bay is well told. The one called
"The Mvstlc" will appeal to all who are
mystics and love the romance of being
so. And this last one. which I give you
entire. I trust will please your ear with
the sound of Its music, your eye with the
imagination of the grace of soaring
wings, and your soul with the mystic
beauty of the thought which is conveyed
In this Inspiration born by the ocean
shore:
TO A SEAGULL.
Bird of the sea.
Ftearltss and free.
Hast thou a home on thÂ« wide rolling ilpep?
Where la thy nest?
When dost thou rest.
And fold thy gray pinions In quiet *nd sleep?

Home I have none on this comfortless shore:
But In far away isles.
"Where the tronic sun smiles.
And nature ii xentie and kind evermore,

There is my nesting place.
There my mate lingers and calls me to com*.
Soon sliall I wing afar.
X*ath the bright southern star.

UTERARY NOTES.
; That most delightful of prose poets.
Charles Warren Stoudard. has returned
after ten years' absence to his adopted
home, California, and Is now at work on
a book which will study the romance and
\ reality of Spanish mission life. Stoddarci*
own life contains more romance than gen
erally falls to the lot of a twentieth-cen
tury author. Fifty years ago, when Cali
fornia was very young and exceeding
lusty, he was taken West by his parents
from the family home in Rochester, N. Y.
At 16 years of age he was going around
Cape Horn as traveling companion for an
elder brother whose health had given out.
; and at 21 he was enjoying his first taste
of life in the South Seas. Â«.he guest there
of a sister who had married a wealthy
planter of the Hawaiian Islands. This
visit was the first of five which afterward
1 bore fruit in "South Sea Idyls," a book
Howells has characterized as the "light--
j est. wildest, freshest, sweetest thing ever
; written of the life of the summer ocean."
Bret Harte It was who suggested the title
of the book. But for Bret Harte. indeed,
the volume would very likely never have
been born, for Stoddard, though he loves
to write, is perhaps the laziest literary
man in America.
'From the pen of this manâ to whom as
the "American Loti" Theodore Bentzon
(Mme. Blanc) devoted thirty pages of the
Revue dcs Deux Mondes not long as"o â
have come some of the most glowing bits
of color In our literature, things whlcft
"have the flavor of the pomegranate in
its native place/ the fire of the oleander,
the softness and languor of summer sea;*,
with a dash. too. of the surf with Its
curving foam, the whole pervaded by the
subtle spirit of the south."â The Reader
(magazine) for January.
Booth Tarkington left an order with
the publishers of John T. McCutcheon's
new book of cartoons. "The Mysterious
Stranger and Other Cartoons," for the
book to be forwarded to Capri imme
diately upon its issue. He writes. to a
! friend how much he has enjoyed the
cartoons now that he has seen them all
together. "They are like the stories wt>
hoped somebody would write," he says,
"and it's to our greater delight chut
we find them drawn instead of written."

The dinner given In honor of Mark
Twain Tuesday evening- by his asso
ciates In the Harper Bros." literary
shop and by his literary contemporar
ies, upon the occasion of his seven
tieth birthday, was the most remark
able thing of Its kind we have any rec
ollection of. He found himself sur
rounded by all of the stars and lesser
lights of the literary firmament, above
whom he towered as the, leader of them
all. America's greatest and most subtlf.
as well as wittiest, sage and philos
opher.
His speech will live as the brightest,
and sweetest he ever delivered on such
an occasion. He closed it with this deli
cate reference to the years that have
come and gone:
:,'*lf you shrink at thought of nlsbt
and winter, the late home-comins from
the banquet and the lights and the
laughter through the deserted streets â
a desolation which would not remind
you now, as for a generation it did.
that your friends are sleeping and you
must creep In a tiptoe and not disturb
them, but would only remind you that
you need not tiptoe, you can never dis
turb them more â if you shrink ;it
thought of these things, you need onlv
reply: 'Your invitation honors me and
pleases me because you still keep me in
your remembrance, but I am 70; 70,
and would nestle In the chimney cor
ner and smoke my pipe and read my
book, and take my rest, wishing you
well in all affection, and that when
you, in your turn, shall arrive at pier
70 you may step aboard your waiting:
ship with a reconciled spirit and lay
your course toward the sinking sun
with a contented heart.' "âNew Haven

NEW PEERESS
FROM AMERICA
Wife of Forbes-Leith, Who
Wa-s Lately Made a Baron,
Had Her Home in St. Louis
MAY ENTERTAIN- KING
Considered Likely That His
Majesty Will Be a Guest
at Her Magnificent Castle
Special Dispatch to The Call.
I/>KDON T , Dec. 30.â 8y conferring a
barony on Alexander John Forbes-Leith,
King Edward has made another Ameri
can woman a peeress. Before her mar
riage, early in the 70's, Mrs. Forbes-Leith,
as she will continue to be known until
her husband decides to what he will
afhx his title of Lord, was Miss Ma
rie Louise January of St. Louis, and her
father was the proprietor of the Joliet
Steel Works. She has never been identi
fied with the Anglo-American colony, and
until the list of the King's birthday hon
ors was published it- was not generally
known that she was a daughter of Co
lumbia, iln fact, neither-she nor her hus
band, although they have a magnificent
town residence in Grosvenor Crescent,
have been conspicuous in ther social life
of the metropolis.
It is a somewhat striking commen
tary on the species of distinction that
leads to a seat in the House of Lords
that the recipient of the only peerage
created in commemoration of his Ma
jesty's birthday is not even mentioned
in- '-Who's ; ,Who." where the nime of
every who amounts to any
thing is -supposed to find a place.
â¢ But now., that Forbes-Leith has, be-,
come a pjser, he is sure not to be over
looked in future edjtions. He is really
better desert-ing of such notice than
many folk whose -claims to contem
porary" fame are there recorded. He
contributed generously to" the raising
of" volunteers for* the Soutfr African
War, "in which his. only a son, an officer
in the Royal Dragoons,* took part and
lost his life. "
H*e is the son of a rear admira> and
was himself In Â° the navy, but retired
from the service while still a lieuten
ant, to take life easy./ He is a \u25a0jveulthy
man, buf how much of his -money he
owes to.hijs wife is not known. Any
how he found himself with enough of
it after bis marriage "to purchase Fyvie
Clstle.in Aberdeen from Sir. Maurice
o Duff-Gordon. It is a Â»fin<? specimen \ of
"Scotch 'baronidl a'rehitecture and 'boasts

LONDON STREET
NAMES CONFUSING
Scores of 'Thoroughfares in
British Metropolis Known
by the Same Designation
STEAXGEBS MYSTIFIED
County Council Will Take Up
the Question and Will Try
to Straighten Out Matters
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LONDON, Dec! 30.â London street
names are causing almost as much
trouble as the unemployed problem, or
fiscal reform. Even. the postal authori
ties are beginning to be worried. As
for strangers in the metropolis; it is
practically useless for sthem to ask
their way about unless they can give
more dtailed information than the mere
number of the house and name of 'the
street they want.'
The reason is simple enough. There
are literally hundreds of streets in Lon
don with identically the same name.
â¢Even such well-known places as Traf
algar Square are .duplicated ;in name
in several places; and there are exactly
106 streets named after Queen ;Victoria.
To illustrate the \u25a0 position, the story
of.some Americ. .', women'who recently,
"wanted to know", might be cited. They
were looking for Bond street, and fol-~
lowed the time-honored, precedent of
asking a policeman.
''How. do we get to Bond street?" they
said.
. Then the policeman asked a question:
"Do you want Bond street, off Amwell
street, Pentonville, North;. Bond street,
Vauxhall, Southwest London; Bond"
street, pff Piccadilly, West; New Bond
street, or Old Bond streetâ which? .
The ladies were staggered, but sug
gested that out of the five Bond streets,
perhaps it was the 'one off Piccadilly,
"where tfie". rings come from."
* In addressing London letters the ut
most confusion exists; and thus has.
grown \he cuÂ«tom.*\of placing on each
London envelope- some initials Indicat
ing the. point "of the compass in the di
rection of which the streets might'pos
siWy be found. Some one suggested
that even more exactitude could be ob
tained in the indication of letters by
point's jot the comp.assâ something more
than 'the mere "N" indicating (north;
"S. W." indicating southwest; "E. C.V
showing: the lbcality to be east central;
a-nd so on. It has been suggested that
letters could be -addressed to Mr. So
and-so, in such a street, "northeast by
east-half "easi," and the postmen de
livering the letters could be equipped
with a CQmplete nautical outfit. But
>.hen even -this suggestion would
scarcely work, \ for during . the winter
months it would be almost impossible
for a postman to "get the sun" and his
observations would come to naught. '
It is .not at all an' -unusual thing for
. a person " living on John street . to have
his letter go completely around the cir
<*ult, of. the citj'râ trom north to sooth,
east and west and finally again â¢to
north before it gets to him, for, De- it
known, there are no lass than forty
height different John streets, in London.
*Bes-ides this, there 'are bewildering
compounds _of John street. ; There's
John Carpenter, street, and John Camp
bell road, and John b Tard and John's
Mews, and .the .changes y e rung on
Jq"hn .so much that if you ,'a.o looking
for. a man who lives anywhei \u25a0 ?in .a
street with a' John to it, 'you may as
well employ, a district-messenger- .to'
locate him first before you begin writ
ing. Then,. â¬or instance, if you wished
your letter to reach him, you could ad
dress it thus: v- ' ;\u25a0â¢;-.
â¢ "John -Johnson, 16 John'streot, east
north-east, half-way between St. Paul's
and the Guildhall,. just oppo
site St. Swithin's. Church and around the
corner from the fire s-tation, London."
Suburban estate builders have run
the gamut of family names, one .builder
naming his streets after his daughters;
another after his sons; a third after his
deceased. wife's sisters, and so , on. j And
thus, in London,'; the 'man looking fora
.person in Albert street has j just seven
"ty-eight different Albert streets to se
lect from. '.
London. has thirty-six James streets;
twenty-nine ' Alfreds; twenty-four
Thomases, eighteen .Henrys, sixteen
Alexanders, forty-two Elizabeths, four
teen Marys, nine Mary-Anns, five Em
ilys, five Emmas, five Elizas and two
Sophias.
Even the names of â¢: great statesmen
have been honored in many, \u25a0 different
parts of : London in endless duplication.
There are eight Gladstone "streets, ten
Palmerstons, eight Pitts, seven Beacons
fields and 'so on.
Another/ favorite -expedient , in street
names. is the adoption of the names of
flowers. There are twenty-four Rose
street's, eight Violet streets and a num
ber of Daisy streets. .â¢
Not the least of the tasks before, the
London County .Council will ' be the,
straightening out of these repeated
names. Just what plan .will be adopted
has not yet been decided/ but the
change that limits the uselof one name,
to a definite area,; and forbids its use
or- repetition, in! that district, will cer
tainly be a welcome one both to 'the
postal authorities and the unhappy, cltl-'
zens who have to \u25a0 live on streets with
fifty or sixty duplicated names all over
town. . '

Outrage Is Charged to Men
"Whom He Prosecuted
When in Office.
BOISE, Idaho, Dec. 30. â Frank Steu
nenberg, former Governor of the' State,
avas killed at 6:40 o'clock tbU evening
at his home in the - suburbs of Cald
well. A dynamite bomb had been
placed at his front sate, with sonic con
trivance by which It was exploded as
he entered. Both legs were blown off
and he lived but twenty minutes.
There is no reason, known for the
outrage, but It is charged to/ some
member of the famous Inner circle of
the Coeur d'Alene dynamiters, whom he
prosecuted so relentlessly in 1899 while
he was Governor.
Governor Gooding is in communica
tion with the authorities of the'eounty
and is prepared to I put the full sup
port of the State behind the officials
there in running down the perpetrator,
of the crime. ItVis, thought probable
that the. leading detective agency of
the country will be asked: to send some
of its best men to' the scene and the
State will offer as great : a reward as
the Governor, may find be has jtower to
propose.'. ; ' â : .}
Steunenberg . was Governor,, of .the
State ; from -1897 ;to 190 i;. having" 1 been'
twice elected.- VHe .was born An. ." lowa'
forty-four, years.ago and had been" in;
Idaho since 1887. He leaves a wife and i
three children.. '.'\u25a0 .
Governor ' Gooding has informed the
Canyon County officials that the State
will offer a. reward of $5000 for the appre-'
henslon of 'the murderers.", A special train'
left for ' Caldwell at ' 10 -o'clock, carrying
the Governor and others, who go to .as
sist in organizing the work iof running
down the criminals.
The latest information from the scene
is to the effect that the bomb probably was
placed by the gate \u25a0 post and the'- moving
of the gate exploded it. When persons
rushing to the spot. reached the prostrate
; man, the latter said something like "Who
shot me?" He also said something about
turning him over, but he . lapsed into ' unÂ»"
consciousness and died without giving any
information.
The victim's clothing and his shoes were
torn to tatters and " his back was terribly
injured. Both legs were shattered fright
fully.
\u25a0 The shock of the explosion' was -felt
1 all over the town and , broke the glass in
the Governor's home. : Every road out of
town is being guarded', and it is hoped
to" intercept suspects. ' , .
Two men are .under suspicion who had
been lying about Nainpa several days,'
and left) for Caldwell to-day. They lived
in theCoeur d'Alenes at.tne time of the
riots there in f 1899. ; ; Descriptions of; them
are being wired in every direction.;;;};
Governor Steunenberg became known
throughout the nation through his con
nection with the Coeur d'Alene miners',
strike which began in the "; spring â¢; of
1599. The Miners' Union made certain
demands, which, were refused Iby the
mine owners. Most; of the mines , were
closed down, but an attempt was ' made
to operate the mill of the Bunker Hill
and Sullivan with non-union help^ . In
April of that year a crowd of . - strike
sympathizers took possession of a train
and went to.the mi 11.,; The building was.
blown up with; dynamited and ?at --least
one man : was . killed ' by the explosion:
The mine owners appealed to = the Gov
ernor for protection, alleging; that -the
strikers, were; resorting , to every form
of violence and . intimidation : to. prevent
the operation of the mine by non-union
men.
BREAKS UP MIXERS' U3VIOX.
The State militia being considered in
sufficient to cope with the .^situation,
Governor Steunenberg . proclaimed a
state of Insurrection . \u25a0, and -,7 called on
President McKinley for Federal troops.
General H. C. Mei'riam' occupied the'dis

questions," said Charles G. Lathrop,
brother of the late Mrs. Stanford, last
night when asked about the results of
the Investigation into the death of Mrs.
Stanford and the accompanying charge
that there was a conspiracy among the
I servants to discredit Miss Bertha
Berner in the eyes of Mrs. Stanford so
that she would not be remembered in
the will of the philanthropist.
**I tell you Dr. Jordan has done all
the talking:, and he will have to an
swer.the questions when he returns
from the East- Ido not know a thing
ebout the case, not one thing. "*
"Have you been conducting an in
vestigation?" was ueked.
"I tell you thai I don't know a thing
about the case. You will have to see
Dr. Jordan."
In cpite of the declarations of Mr.
.Lathrop tfeat he knows nothing about
the case tlie general feeling in Palo
Alto among those who are close to the
business .management of the university
Is that a most searching investigation
. has been conducted ooncerning the
death of Mrs. Stanford.
A maÂ°n who is very close to the man
Â«gement t said last night ihat he had
been told by at member of the university
board of trustees that the board had
been conducting an investigation and
tak'en ui> every phase of the case. A
great Ocal of money has been spent in
clearing up the mystery surrounding:
the woman's death, with the result that
now every iota of evidence connected
â¢u-Jlh the case has been sifted out. De
tectives have been nt work since the
hour of her death and only completed
their work a few weeks ago. Chemists
In San Francisco have been examining
the vitals of Mrs, Stanford and sub
jecting them to severe chemical tests
to find out whether they had been ef
fected by any poison.
It was proved that Mrs. Stanford did
not die of poison, but from heart trouble,
caused probably by overheating on the
day of the picnic, which she and her com
panion f lien ha Berner, attended. It is a
matter of proof that the other servants
about the house tried to cause the impres
eion that Miss Berner had placed the
IKii^on in the water the first time Mrs.
Stanford complained. So much has been
unearthed, and probably much more,
â¢which the trustees have not made pub
lic. It, iÂ« eaid on good authority, how
ever, that the trustees were very angry
at the Honolulu physicians who worked
upon ihe case and alleged at the time
that they were incompetent.
' When asked questions along these lines
Mr. Lathrop refused to talk, saying that
Dr. Jordan had done all the talking, and
that he must answer all questions. He
evidently was not pleased that the head
of the university had given out any in
formation.
The members of his family were equally
reticent, on the subject. Dr. James C.
Branncr. vice president of the university,
was nearly as mum as Lathrop. "I do
not' know anything about the matter,"
he said. "No; ] will not say that no in
vestigation has been conducted. I will
only say. that I know nothing about It
whatever. President Jordan will be home
enS Wednesday and he can answer all
<iuastioÂ»s."
Dr.. James A. Stillman. head of the
chemistry department and many times
acting head of the university.' declared
last night tttat he knew nothing of any

the university, would not discuss the

In a position to make comments.
"1 will say that if we had any such evi
dence as Dr. Jordan claims Is on hand we
would have made arrest* long agd. For
Instance. Miss Richmond, Mrs. Stanford's
former maid, haa been allowed by us to
go to her home in England several months
ago. If we did not think her entirely in
nocent we would surely have detained
her.
"If Dr. Jordan is quoted correctly, he
directs his suspicions directly against two
persons, Miss Richmond and Ah Wing,
the Chinese cook. Long ago we proved
both to tbt satisfaction of ourselves and
to the general public that neither of these
persons had anything to do with a con
spiracy to turn Mrs. Stanford against her
secretary. Miss Berner.
"There could be no one else to cast the
finger of suspicion at, for Miss Richmond
nnd Ah Wing were the only persons who
*.vere close enough to the dead woman to
hatch out such a plot. But they had
nothing to do with it and we allowed them
to go their way after the Investigation.
"As regards the hold-ups by Honolulu
officials. I will answer that it is all non
bense. For Instance, there were four doc
tors attending to the case. They worked
hard over It and each put in a bill for
JGOO. " That was very reasonable, consid
ering the work they did. 1 was surprised
at the small amount. I know just what
was spent at Honolulu, for I was in touch
with every phase of the casÂ« there, and
no hold-up occurred.
"The officials did not have a chance to
do any work in this line, for the reason
that the investigation was simply con
fined to the household, and as there was
nothing of a startling nature to keep quiet
the public knew Just what was happening
and therefore ho one had a chance to
make any demands. High Sheriff Henry
conducted the case In a business-like way
and I know neither he nor any of his
deputies ever attempted to play the game
of hold-up on any of us while we. were
there. â¢
"The bills have all been paid long ago.
They were all reasonable, and therefore I
cannot understand how the hold-up story
managed to crop out, or where It came
from. Dr. Jordan did not know any of
the detail* in that line, and this further
convinces me he is being misquoted.
"While making my investigation at the
islands 1 employed five stenographers, bo
many people did I question and to such
an extent. It would have been impossible
for any one to secure a full text of these
reports cave myself. I had them all
transcribed and brought them to this city,
where I turned them over to Mr. Wilson.
Nobody save he, Charles Lathrop and
myself knew what they contained. Dr.
Jordan was not informed and could not
have learned their contents.
"I have been turning in reports to Wil
son and Lathrop from time to time, and ;
they have kept the matter secret from
everybody else. We are etill working on
this case, though nothing has developed
that would furnish any startling news. I
am not in a position to make public any
of the data I collected during my re
search. In fact, there is nothing that
would interest the public, and that is one
of the reasons that Mr. Wilson has not
deemed it necessary to give out the re
port.
"There is absolutely no necessity to
plunge into the poison myetery any more.
We fully demonstrated after Mrs. Stan
ford's death that strychnine never killed
her. That is an old story now 1 , and I
thought it had been settled to the satis
faction of everybody. It seems strange
that Dr. Jordan should mention this
again, for it was settled so long ago as to
have almost entirely slipped the minds of
all of us connected with the case."
Albert Beverley, the butler, who was
discharged by Mrs. Stanford some time
before her death and whose name 1 was
mentioned with so much prominence dur
ing the noted case, has left his San Mateo
home. Lest October he disposed of his
property and came to live In this city.
An attempt was made to locate him last
night, but without succesÃ.
Beverley is still in this city. He was
seen at the racetrack a few days ago.
He was never kept under surveillance
after the police and the Morse detective
agency became satisfied he was entirely
innocent of any plot or scheme to obtain
money from Mrs. Stanford. .
Ah Wing is also some place in the vicin
ity. He was allowed td go where he chose
after the case had been closed several
months ago. Some suspected that the
Chinaman knew- more than he wished to
tell at the time, but Captain Callundan
was convinced the Celestial was innocent,
and for that reason no watch was kept
on him lately.
Captain Callundan said he did not think
anything would come of the present story,
and that neither himself nor Wilson
would take any action, as they are fear
ful that a mistake has been made in
quoting Jordan.
MORGAN AGREES
WITH JORDAN
Chemist Declares Death
Was Due to Nat
, ural Causes.
Dr. Charlas L. Morgan, former city
toxicologist. when Interviewed last night
said: "Mrs. Stanford died of natural
causes. I would not talk on the case,
having been retained with that under
standing:, but as long as Dr. Jordan has
given out the statement that Mrs. Stan
ford died of natural causes, viz., fatty
degeneration of the heart, I will say that
to far as to her having died of natural
causes Dr. Jordan is right. Mrs. Stan
ford did not, however, die of fatty de
generation of the heart. True, she died
of a heart lesion; just what It was I am
not prepared to Bay."
Dr. Morgan was loth to talk on the
case. liis reason for reticence regarding
the findings in the Stanford ease was
that he had been retained for his chem
ical and medical assistance, - providing
that he report, and report alone, to
Mountf ord Wilson, attorney for the Stan
ford estate. , â
Dr. Morgan examined some of the al
leged strychnine-poisoned ' bicarbonate of
60da and flled his report with Wilson,
lie would not state whether he found
strychnine tn the.nowder. He said that
he was not given* the work of examining
Mrs. Stanford's heart. Ho saw it, how
ever, saw the report, , and knew that the
death of Mrs. Stanford had been due to
a heart lesion. Ha said that. there were
several physicians retained In the case
and. they made the . report In , regard to
the heart's condition. The . report was
signed Jointly by all the physicians con
nected with the caae. ......
The report of the chemists and physi
cians has been In the hands of Attorney
Wilson since . May. Dr. Morgan \u25a0, stated
that Wilson had Intended to \ .make the
same public last June, having received
the written consent of the relatives of
Mrs. Stanford. \u25a0 Dr. Morgan says other
Icfonnatloa mi being looked up, taxi:
THE' S AN : FRANgISCO, CALL; > SUNDAY. DECEMBER 31, 1905. Â£
the publication of the report was with
held for the present. . .
Dr. Morgan said, In conclusion: "Mrs.
Stanford died of natural causes. She did
not die of strychnine poisoning. Whether
an attempt to polaon her by ; means of
strychnine was marie. I cannot say. I
did not do any detective work on the
case, but merely dM the chemical testing
that was allotted to mo.
'.'I have never found in any case â¢ that
where enough strychnine ' has been
taken, a toxic dose, the . same poison
could not be found in woighable quanti
ties In the body of the person killed by
lt_ You may get a coloring: of the drug
where a non-toxic quantity had been
taken. Mrs. Stanford took a capsule for
her heart the night preceding: her death.
This capsule contained as one of its In
gredients a minute quantity ,of strych
nine. It was not enough to kill." ,
Dr. Morgan was asked, if, in the light
of his statement! concurring' with the
statement of Dr. Jordan, that Mrs. Stan
ford's death was due to natural causes,
it would be logical to presume that
there was no strychnine in the bi
carbonate of soda she had taken prior
to "her death,' provifling she had partaken
of the same bicarbonate of soda as was
examined by the chemists, or. that the
compound of soda taken contained such a
small quantity of the poison as to be
harmless. He replied with a shrug of
the shoulders that he could not say,
again stating that he was forbidden to
discuss the case.
A' physician who was employed by the
Stanford estate to examine Mrs. Stan
ford's heart but who refused to allow
his name to be used, last night said: "If
you will take the report of the proceed
ings of the inquest in Honolulu you will
find that Dr. Edmund Shorey, chemist
or the (United States Agricultural Station,
and R. A. Duncan, Food Commissioner
and Chemical Analyst of the Honolulu
Health Board, stated under oath that
they could not say that they found
strychnine "in the corpse of Mrs. Stan
ford. Both of these men are of the high
est standing in. their calling. They could
not find evidence of strychnine poisoning.
There was a preconcerted effort on the
part of some physicians in Honolulu to
make out the cause of Mrs. Stanford's
death as due to strychnine.','
The same doctor gave out the.intima
tion that an attempt had been made to
poison Mrs. Stanford, but that it had
not been successful.
It would seem only logical to presume
In the light of the statements made
last night by Dr. Morgan that ho found
no weighable quantity of strychnine in
the bicarbonate of soda examined* by
him. -'â¢:
Against the statements of Dr. Jordan.
Dr. Morgan, Dr. Shorey of Honolulu and
R. A. Duncan, chemist in the island city,
that Mrs. Stanford's death was due to aÂ«
heart lesion, whether that lesion was
caused by the poisonous action of strych
nine, is vividly recalled the testimony of
Drs. "Wood, F. R. Day and George Her
bert of Honolulu, who testified that they
believed that^Mrs. Stanford had died of
strychnine poisoning, having, found the
drug in her body and observed its symp
toms before death and its effects after
death. \u25a0 - - .
BERTHA BERNER
NOT TALKATIVE
Hopes ; However,' ' 7 'hat
Mystery Will Be
Cleared Up.
PAIX) ALTO, Dec. 80. â Bertha Ber
ner, the companion of Mrs. Stanford at
the time of her death at Honolulu, re
fused to be interviewed last * night.
The great house on, the Palo Alto foot
hills given to Mlas Berner by Mrs;
Stanford about- six years ago -was
tightly locked. Miss Berner did not
appear all day yesterday, "â¢> but her
brother, C. Berner, told the newspaper
men that his sister had nothing to say
on the matter. "We have nothing one
way or the .other. to say about the af
fair," he declared.
But Miss Berner has not been so
silent concerning: her hopes for a so
lution of the ' mystery. - For "many
months after the . death of Mrs. Stan
ford she would say " nothing on ; the
subject of the philanthropist's death,
but within the last two weeks she has
talked quite freely among- her friends
and her words seem to prove conclu
sively that the trustees have been
making a thorough investigation.
"I do hope that when they are
through investigating," she said, "that
there will not be one phase of the
mystery left unsolved. I hope so for
my own sake. I have been accused of
everything â of actually giving the
poison, of desiring; her millions- "and
of much else. I know the public does
not believe these statements, but â¢ I
want the investigation to give .the ac
tual facts to the public. , I am inno
cent of any wrong in the whole affair.
I will not say that any one fs to blame.
I loved Mrs: Stanford dearly and did
everything I could' for her."- .:

NEW YORK, Dec. 30.â After four
months :of arduous work, the Legislative
Committee on , Insurance Investigation,
appointed at an extra' session of the last
Legislature, adjourned to-night.
To-night was given overto;Â£he presen
tation of documentary evidence, which
was Vot in | readiness for the committee
until the present time.
Late in the day somewhat of as tir was
caused by the announcement of Counsel
Hughes that a letter had been received
from David B. \u25a0 .Hill, who protested
against the hearing being closed until; he
had been heard as a witness in \u25a0 regard to
his retainer from the ' Equitable Life As
surance Society. Chairman Armstrong
announced that, notwithstanding Hill's
attitude, the committee would have, to
complete Its work without 'his testimony.
Not the least interesting testimony j of
the day was that of George H. Sickles, a
real estate agent of Buffalo/who had for
merly been employed by the ' Equitable
Life. According -to Sickles, Gage K. Tar
bell, vice president of ; the Equitable, sug
gested a plan to get around the rebating
methods. Tarbell, on the witness . stand,
said he opposed rebating. Sickles testified
that Tarbell : suggested that letters be
written |to policy, holders and eventually
these letters were to be bought back at a
price.
The committee adjourned subject. to the
call of the chair, in case of an emergen
cy before the Legislature assembles on
Tuesday next. After adjournment the
committee held an executive session. ,

BINGHAM TO DO
HIS LEVEL BEST
Army Veteran Given Charge
of the New York Police Is
Enthusiastic Over Duties
PLEDGE TO TIIE PUBLIC
Simply Intends to Carry
Out the Law as He Finds
It in the Statute Book 3
NEW YORK, Deo. SO.-â General Theo
dore A. Bingham, who soon will as
sume control of ':. New York's police
department," to-day outlined the; policy
he purposes to follow in his new posi
tion.
"I Intend to jump into the Job and do
my, level beat,"., he said. "I : intend to
try to get the "confidence of the people
and keep it I suppose there are plenty
of kndekers. bur I don't 'care. I am
absolutely independent and will try to
do good work. We need good govern
ment and that , is what I am going to
try to give." . , '
\u25a0.: General Bingham said that he did not
intend to use 'the office as a stepping
stone to: anything, else.
"It Is adman's Job," he said, "and if a
man is successful it ought to be enough
to keep $iim busy the rest of his life."
He.said'thathe was able to outline
his policy only in this general way be
cause he was not familiar wKh any of
the details of the office. . He never had
visited police headquarters and was not
sure he could find it, without a guide.
It was his intention to | take things as
they came, and if reforms were needed,
he said, they would be instituted.
"It's the biggest Job, I ever was up
against," said the new Commissioner.
"It presents difficulties: that are almost
superhuman.. The .police , department
must be an executive department, and
when I assume the office I shall simply
try to carry out the law as it is on
the statute books. I have a reasonable
hope of succeeding.
"I am. not going. in with the pur
pose of making any record; I am simply
going to. do my duty as I see it. As
yet I have no opinions about the job,
but I hope I have the backbone. There
will always be a . certain amount of
vice In a community; but I am going to
enforce the laws, that: regulate vice,
and enforce them without regard to any
body. I am absolutely independent. I
took the place to help out my old friend
Mac. I know if I do. good work it will
help the McClellan administration and
I'm going to work as hard as I know
how."
Police Commissioner William McAdoo
to-night made public his letter to
Mayor McClellan, presenting his resig
nation, to take: effect, to-morrow. Mc-
Adoo. states that his resignation was
requested by the Mayor, but says such
a' request would not have been neces
sary had it even been Intimated to him
what the Mayor's wishes were in the
premises: ' He declared Mayor McClel
lan had no cause whatever for keeping
him in studied ignorance of his inten
tions. ; \u25a0 V.
In his letter Commissioner McAdoo
quotes a letter which He addressed to
Mayor McClellan in October last, call
ing his attention to a newspaper inter
view attributed to the Mayor, In which
certain . police officials were criticized.
McAdoo told the Mayor that without
the support of the city's head ,he could
not consent to remain In the police de
partment.. '\u25a0\u25a0'.
In the Mayor's reply to this letter,
dated October 3, he wrote to Mr. Mc-
Adoo: "I am Indeed sorry that my ac
tion of yesterday should have awaken
ed in your mind even the slightest sus
picion that you and your administra
tion did not have my , fullest confi
dence." ":<;V:
The Mayor concluded: "With* undi
mlnished faith in you and your, admin
istration and, with assurances of my
personal esteem," etc.
. After giving this correspondence in
full, Commissioner McAdoo concludes
his letter of resignation as follows:
"If a vacancy was desired to be cre
ated, I should have . been consulted
with; if we -had differed as to a ques
tion of policy; it should have been a
manly and honest one from which " we
could have parted as friends; if it re
lated to my personal conduct or that of
those under me, I should at least have
been given t a hearing; If you believed
that my continuance in this office wag
an advantage to the public, ypu owed it
to them and to me to say so and to at
least have: given me the opportunity of
refusing in thlsr connection any further
honors, or even if you were. convinced
to the contrary the unusual circum
stances ':; under which I accepted this
trust and our personal relations de
manded that you should so state to me
in that candid and honorable way
which prevails among gentlemen."

"The question before the Republicans
of the State of New York is whether the
Republican organization" and leadership is
to be continued along the lines which
have led to widespread distrust and sus

party is so to clean house as to render
the Republican house the most attractive
for a majority of the people to dwell In.
"It seems to me that President Roose

pointing the way, not for the purpose of
injuring any particular man or any par

with dynamite the steamship Pennsyl

via Philadelphia crashed into the schoon
er Prescott Palmer to-day while the
schooner was aground on Cherry Island
flats in the Delaware River. So great
was the impact that although the colli

until late In the afternoon that the ves
sels were separated. The sharp prow of
the steamer cut into the schooner's stern
for a distance of thirty feet. That the
Pennsylvania's cargo of dynamite did not
explode is regarded as little short of
miraculous. The Prescott Palmer is hard
aground and is in danger of breaking hi

WASHINGTON. Dec. 30.â Solicitor W.

statement regarding; his retirement
from the State Department:
"In view of erroneous interpretations
which have been, given to the motives
for my resignation as solicitor for the

any Indelicate or Improper assumption
on my part to criticise as a subordinate
official the judgment of my chiefs."

of State Root to Penfield was mad*
public:
"I have communicated to the Presi
dent your letter, dated the 23d lnst, in
which you tender your resignation of
the office of solicitor for the State De

"The President directs me to say that
in accepting your resignation he sin
cerely regrets the" termination of your
long and distinguished services. For
myself I beg to assure you of the re
luctance witn which I view the sever
ance of your important position with
this department.
"Regretting the loss the public ser
vice sustains in your retirement and
appreciating your zeal and earnestness
in the fulfillment of your duties. I trust
you will carry with you an agreeable
recollection of our personal association

Woman's Trials.
T^ye bitter trail In a woman's life is to
be childless. Who can tell how hard the
straggle may hare been ere she learnt to
rcsiya herself to her lonely lot? The ab-
sence of this link to bind marital life
together, the absence of this one pledge
to mutual affection Is a common disap-
pointment. Many unfortunate couples
become estranged thereby. Even if they
do not drift apart, one may read the whole
extent of their disappointment in the eyes
of such a childless couple wly>n they rest
on the children of others. To them tho
largest famflydoos not seem too numerous.
'Iq many cases of barrenness or child-
lessness the obstacle to child-bearing is
easily remored by the cure of weakness on
the part of tho woman. Dr. Pierces Fa-
vorite Prescription has been the means of
restoring health and fruitf ulness to many
a barren woman, to the great joy of the
household. In otuer, but rare cases, the
obstruction to the bearing of children has
beea.fonnd to be of a surgical character,
bnt easily removable by painicss operative
treatment at tbe Invalids' Hotel and .Sur-
gical Institute. Buffalo, N. V.. over which
Dr. Pterce of the "Favorite Prescription"
fame presides. In all cases where chil-
dren are desired and are absent, an effort
should be made to find oat the real cause,
since it is generally so easily removed by
proper treatment. *
I In all tbe various weaknesses, displace-
i&'-n^K. prolapsus, inflammation and de-
biUtatjng, catarrhal drains and in all
casts of nervousness and debility, Dr.

efficient remedy that can possibly be used.
It hap to its credit hundreds of thousands

GOVERNOR GENERAL DOUBASSOFF OF MOSCOW. WHOSE COSSACKS AND
ARTILLERY HAVE BROUGHT THE INCIPIENT REVOLUTION IN THE
"HOLY CITY" Op RUSSIA TO ITS FINAL STAGES.
the fact that Governor General Doubas
soff refused to negotiate with the strike
committee which sought to obtain a free
pardon for th* participants in the up
rifing, the leaders of the righting organi
zations, encouraged by the failure of* the
troops to occupy or destroy the barri
cides in the northwest section of the city,
decided to continue the struggle and this
morning the revolutionists were again In
possession of their old strongholds in the
Brunnaya quarter. The Governor Gen
eral is evidently waiting, until he has suf
ficient troops to hold the disturbed region,
when it will be cleared.
Nevertheless, the work of routing out
the revolutionists will be difficult, and,
perhaps, costly, as the tactics of the rev
olutionists are not to fight In the open,
but to defend the barricades which are
used to impede the movement of troops,
\u25a0while, from the adjoining houses,' little
groups in ambush shoot at the soldiers
and throw bombs. The maze of narrow,
crooked streets and the hilly s nature of
the ground make it practically impos
sible to ' use artillery effectively, and
eventually will compel the troops to clear
the region by moving from house to
house. The region covers several square
miles between the river and Tverskaia,
and is hemmed in by. troops, whose lines
cut off the revolutionists from the Brest
railroad on the east. The troops occupy
a ridge along the boulevard.
A correspondent had no difficulty In
traversing the whole region under the es
cort of a member of the "Drujlna," or a
fighting organization of the revolution
ists. The pickets near the boulevard were
then exchanging a sharp fusillade. The
"Drujina" did not appear to be well or
ganized and lacked regular officers. The
Workmen's Council was supposed to have
general direction of the workmen's army,
but each group seemed to act on Its own
initiative. The majority of the men were
armed only with revolvers of a cheap pat
tern. Two companies of 200 men each,
however, were armed with repeating shot
guns and a few rifles. The most business
like feature was the "Drujina's" hospital,
which was equipped with a regular sur
gical staff arid Sisters of Mercy. The
wounded men were well cared for. The
troops on Thursday captured a surgical
detachment of the revolutionists com
manded by Dr. Abramoff, a Jew.
Tho members of the "Drujina" are very
boastful. They declare they are not dis
couraged, and that, on the contrary, they
will again take the offensive.
Troops are continually arriving here.
The latest arrivals are the Daghestan
Cavalryâ big, dashing-looking fellows,
with scarlet-tipped caps.
The police continue to make domiciliary
visits at night, . and have seized an im
mense quantity of revolvers. In one
house, inhabited chiefly by Jews, they
captured sixty-nine revolvers and several
bombs. The owners of the weapons were
taken to the prison, which is already full
to overflowing.
In the daytime people passing through
the gates of the old wall of the city are
almost invariably searched.- Even sleighs
containing richly dressed persons are
stopped and . the occupants are compelled
to descend and pass through the hands
of the. wild Cossack soldiery, who search
every person for concealed arms.
It Is difficult to ffirm an estimate of the
casualties, but , they have been greatly
overstated. The losses of the troops and
police have been mainly from ambush
work, but they are comparatively small
and probably will not reach a hundred.
So far as the other casualties are con
cerned, those of the workmen generally
and innocent sufferers, 2500 is perhaps a
conservative estimate.
GENERAL STRIKB CALKED OFF.
6T. PETERSBURG, Deo. 31.â The
THE SAN FRANCISCO GALL, SUNDAY. DECEMBER 31,) .1005:
Council of Workmen met secretly last
night and after an eight-hour session"
at 2 o'clock this morning adopted a
resolution to call off the strike on
Monday "because the fight of the peo
ple against the Government can
longer be limited to the disorganiza
tion' of the economic life of the nation
through a universal strike and is al
ready in many parts of the country
taking on the character of. an un
armed rising.
"The Council of Workmen's depu
ties," the resolution concludes, "de
cides to proceed immediately * with
warlike operations and the organiza
tion of an armed uprising."
The council recognized that the or
ganization of an immediate rising
could not succeed In the capital, but,
while making preparations, it would
be necessary to undertake a sort of
guerrilla warfare, consisting of the
disarming of police and soldiers
wherever they are^ound alone on the
street's, the use of bombs from am
bush and other acts of terror..
The council drew up a proclamation
to the Cossacks warning them that if
they continued to fight against the
people they would be treated like mad
dogs and if they wished to be treat
ed as brothers they should remain in
their barracks.
An appeal was also drawn up re
questing the proletariat of all coun
tries to support the fight begun at
Moscow.

SUNDAY'S CALL.
Czar's Premier Leads Dynasty 's
Foes Into Making Fatal Blunder.
Seeming Paralysis of Government
Only a" Ruse to Entrap Rebels.
ST. PETERSBURG, Dec. 30.â Hie Gov
ernment claims that the attempt , at an
crmed rebellion has failed signally. In a
senJ-official communication issued i to
night it declared the movement* has been
broken and that within a few weeks it
would be definitely crushed. It attributes
the defeat of the "reds" not only to the
force the Government employed, but to a
lack of public 'sympathy.
Simultaneously the . Government . an
nounces that the regulations for the elec
tions to the national assembly have been
completed and will be published to-mor
row, and that everything possible will be
done to accelerate the meeting of "the
Douma, in which the voice of; the nation,
and not of a single class, can be heard.
A member of the Cabinet said to-day:
"The result of the attempt of the revo
lutionists to overthrow the Government
by force was never for a moment in
doubt, but what has occurred and what
is occurring we believe will have a salu
tary effect on public opinion. The revolu
tion will go on, but it is our purpose to
confine it to peaceful channels."
A prominent revolutionary leader, who
is a leading spirit in the movement to
raze the dynasty and its regime and for
whom the police are searching, was un
able to conceal his depression, but nev
ertheless he claimed that the movement
had received only a temporary check.
ENTRAPPED DV D IS WITTE.
"We blundered badly," he said. "We fell
into the trap Dc Witte set for us. Em
boldened at the seeming paralysis of the
Government, we proclaimed broadcast our
intention of preparing an armed revolu
tion for January or February. We vir
tually threw our cards on the table then.
"De Witte challenged and we rashly
accepted before organization was per
fected or plans matured. It was all too
sudden and 111-timed. The workmen were
worn out by the recent strikes and the
holidays were at hand, and, besides, we
obtained active co-operation neither from
the populace, on which we had counted,
nor from^the troops, among whom we
know we have support. It is a bad re
verse. Our most skillful leaders have been
arrested and the supplies of arms which
we laboriously collected have been seized.
"But the situation has also its
bright side, for it is the first time the
proletariat has fought in : the 'open
against the, bayonets and. cannon of
the Government. That is a great vic
tory. The Government must not flatter
Itself that' it has dealt a decisive blow.
We have- dedicated our ., lives to the
work. We are fighting not only for
the emancipation of Russia," but for the
social revolution of the world.".
ZERO WEATHER AIDS CZAR.
The elements are now righting on
the side of the Government, as they
did in the days of Napoleon. The north
ern winter, with all its rigors, has set
in; the upper half of the empire is
locked in snow and ice, and it would
be difficult for the proletariat to build
and defend barricades in the streets and
fight a winter campaign. In St. Peters
burg to-night the temprature is 18
degrees below zero and everywhere
fixes are burning in the streets to keep
the homeless fiom freezing.
No other details have been received
of the horrible affair at Moscow to-day,
when Governor General Doubassoff's ar
tillery brought the waH3 of the Prok
haroff cotton mills tumbling down on
the heads of several thousand strikers
and revolutionaries, except a statement
that hundreds perished. ,
The attempt of "Black Hundreds" to
march into the city and wreak
vengeance on the revolutionaries and
strikers only tends to confirm the fears
that the final collapse . of the revolt
at Moscow will be followed by an awful
massacre, and although Governor \u25a0Gen
eral Doubassoff succeeded in prevent
ing their entry into the city to-day
and will take stern measures in \he
future it will be difficult to restrain
the lower classes, who regard the,rev
olutionaries as enemies of the Emperor
and the country. Already rowdies are
taking advantage of the situation to
plunder on a large scale.
LOSSES OP TROOPS S LIGHT.
Governor General Doubassoff has not
yet given the figures of the losses dur
ing tho fighting at Moscow, saying that
It is .< impossible at present to more
than make, a guess. However, he places
the outside limit at 3000. The troops
and, police did not suffer nearly jso
heavily as the rebels, and it is re-^
ported that up to Thursday night' there
were less than fifty casualties all told
among them. -
Throughout Russia, I Immediately on
the appearance of disorders, the , au
thorities are declaring martial law,
making wholesale^ arrests and. confis
cating arms. /
The general strike seems to be going
to pieces. It was declared off at Riga
to-day and at Odessa Jt Is breaking, up
and many railroads are resuming I op
erations.
The result of the call for an. armed
rising in Poland to-morrow is awaited
with anxiety.

NEW YORK, Dec. 30.â That Japan In

state, -was a statement made to-day by
Korekiyo Takahashl. the Japanese finan

hashi was asked wtfether Korea will be
made to pay any part of Japan's debt he
said:
"No, we will develop Korea, but not tax
her. The question of a Japanese protec
torate in Korea is misunderstood in this
country. Korea is a weak nation and
needs protection. Japan has no intention
of making her a vassal or a state of the
nation. But she intends to dominate Ko
rea's foreign relations to preserve the
peace of the Far East. So long as It is
othewise Korea is liable -to become the
prey of other nations. To prevent this
Japan has taken upon herself the work of
looking after -Korea, but. In no wise is it
intended to interfere with her internal af
fairs."
"Will your country sell Saghalien Isl
and to help pay off the debt?" was asked.
"Japan will not sell her possession." he
replied. "It is too valuable in coal, oil arid
mines, and Japan intends to develop the
property."
Takahashi said he had been instru

WASHINGTON, Dec. SO.â ThÂ« Chines*
Minister here. Sir Chtntun* LJanj
Chen?, called at the State Department
to-day to notify Secretary Root officially
of tho departure from China for this
country of an imperial commission com
posed of two Chinese of nign degree, and
a numerous and brilliant staff of attend
ants, who have been charged by the Chi
nese Government with the task of study
ing: American political, military, naval,
educational and industrial methods. This
commission will stop at Honolulu on tha
way across the Pacific for a f3W days,
and is timed to arrive in San Francisco
on January 18. At that port the mem
bers will be accorded 'all of the courte
sies and facilities usually bestowed upon
visiting diplomatists charged with spe
cial missions. Traveling overland, the
commission will reach Washington about
January 21. and will take up their resi
dence at the Chinese legation.
Secretary Root has already charged
Charles Denby, the chief clerk of tho
I>epartment of State and formerly secre
tary of legation at Peking, with the duty
of receiving and caring for the commis
sion in behalf of the Government. Not
withstanding the formidable task set for
them, the commissioners expect to com
plete the investigation of American,
methods in three weeks, when they will
return to China. At the head of tho
commission is General Tuan Fong. He is
a Manchu. and is known in his own prov
ince under the name of Tokrow. At pres
ent he is Governor of the province of
Hunan, and was recently acting Viceroy
of Hunan and Hupeh.
following closely upon th!s American
commission, probably coming on the next
steamer, but landing at Seattle instead
of San Francisco, will comÂ© another com
mission headed by Hslang Chiheng, tho
present acting Governor of the province
of Shantung. This commission is to do
in Europe what the ilrst commission is
to undertake in America. But they will
be in no haste to reach their destination,
and expect to make a stay also in Wash
ington and their way across the country
to take ship for Europe.
In sending these commissions abroad, as
the matter was explained to Secretary
Root, the Chinese Government is seeking
to emulate Japan and intends . to follow
the example of that nation in freely
availing itself of the best of modern for

of mending for some of the unmarried
men employed in the Reigate shops. Then,
however, her eyesight gave out, and.
much against hr will, she was obliged to
apply for parish relief. The Poor Law
Guardians of Reigate granted her a dol
lar a week, but even in a little* English
town that sum doesn't go very far, and
the old lady was In rather low water
\u25a0when Lady Curzon happened to hear of
her case. The American peeress promptly
declared that she would allow Miss Havie
52 a week more, and since then that sum
has been, "paid regularly to' the aged
spinster by" Lady Curzon's London
bankers. Â«
Shortly after the ex-Vicereine's recent
return from the East sh"e sent her vener
able pensioner a handsome Indian shawl,
which sho had brought back especially
for her and which, needless to say, great
ly delighted its recipient. . Thanks to
Lady Curzon's benevolence. Miss Havie Is
now living comfortably In a cottage in
Reigate, and says she is not enly going to
live to be a hundred, but well on past the
century mark.

PLANS TO AID
THE UNEMPLOYED
Joseph Fels, the Millionaire.
Would Cut Up the Large
Estates of Great Britain
LAND FOR THE POOH
Agriculture, He Contends, if
Properly Carried Out Will
Solve the Big Problem
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LONDON, Dec. 30. â Joseph Fels, the
Anglo-American millionaire, who has
interested himself deeply in the Eng
lish unemployed problem, has gone to
the United States in order to study
similar Industrial Issues which affect
America. Fels recently offered to en
able a number of public and municipal
bodies in England to start farm colo
nies throughout the country, and in
order to ascertain Just how far-reach
ing his proposals are and what their
ultimate result if put into practical
operation might be, your correspond
ent called on him at his London office.
"1 believe," said Fels, "that my pro
posals would ultimately solve the prob
lem of the unemployed in this coun
try. My main object in interesting my
self in this matter is to call attention
to the real problem which lies at the
base of the whole matter-Â»-that of the
land. In the first place, I don't be
lieve In private ownership of land at
all, but of course that has nothing to
do with the present case.
"However, let us put the matter In an
other light first. lam now aiding differ
ent boards of guardians and other
public bodies to form farm colo
nies cf the unemployed. This will ul
timately result in giving to each family
what I call a small farm-garden of, say,
about five acres. Of course, only such
men will be allowed to work this land as
have proved themselves good agricultur
ists on the farm colonies, first. These
men will begin what we call the intensive
cultivation of the soilâ that is, working
under the most up-to-date modern scien
tific methods."
"But how about skilled farrhers who are
already willing to work the land, but
cannot get to it?" was interposed. ; .
"There are thousands of men such as
you describe all over England to-day,"
was the reply. "They have been literally
divorced from the soilâ driven from itâ
because the great landlords wished to
hold large tracts of this land for their
own private purposes; and who, at pres
ent, do not use the soil for agriculture in
Ms true use."
"But how can you make these rich peo
ple divide up their land?" was asked.
"Oh, rather easily," was Mr. Fels*
quick response. "When individual farm
gardeners in various places in Great
Britain prove how successful they are
there will be created all over the country
an acute land hunger for small holdings
among the poor. This will bring about a
big agitation and the people will Insist on
a Beparation of taxationâ that is on land
and house propertyâ and the general tax
ation of land values. This will place all
-taxes for public purposes on the land
where it belongsâ and these taxes will no
longer be permitted to cripple industry
by taxing our buildings and our labor.
"If taxation of land values was brought
into force," continued Mr. Fels, "all the
large estates would be split up automat
ically, and such tremendous impetus
would be given to building and industrial
projects generally that no one would be
out of employment who could do any
work.
"The breaking up of these great
landed estates would result in im
mense benefit to England. \u25a0 I actually
know of thousands of cases where
skilled farm cultivators cannot get
work simply because the big landlords
won't let them have the land. The
proper taxation of land values will
make these great land owners let go,
and then the people can get the land
at reasonable figures."
"But poor persons like the unem
ployed could not afford to buy land."
"Quite true," responded Mr. Fels,
"nor would I actually give It to them.
I would make them pay for It at the
lowest nominal rate consistent with
a low Interest on the investment of |
whatever public body or private person
bought the land and placed it at the
disposal of these people."
LIFE ON MARS

Astronomer Flaminarion Be

Special Cable to The Call and New York Her
ald. Copyright, 1905. by the New York
Herald l'ublishlr.g: Company.
PARIS, Dec 30.â M. Camllle Flam
marion, the famous author and astrono
mer, In an interview in one of the Paris
papers, draws an extremely attractive
picture of the life on Mars. After
pointing out that no one can predict
what weather Paris will have next
week, while It is known with the ut
most certainty what kind of weather
any country in Mars will have a fort
night in advance. M. Flammarion goes
on to say:
"There are many advantages in favor
of the Martians. First of all, it would
be difficult for the human species there
to be less intelligent than ours, seeing
that we do not know how to control
ourselves. BESS
"The second reason Is that progress
is an absolute law. which nothing can
resist. The inhabitants of Mars, be
ing older than we are, may represent
what we shall be in several million
years.
"A third circumstance in their favor
is that they are in a better position
than we are to free themselves more
quickly from the heaviness of matter,
as the Martians weigh less. There tho
years are twice as long as ours on
earth.
"Finally, the climatic conditions on
Mars appear to be much more agree
able."
M. Flammarion declares that the
hypothesis that Mars is Inhabited by
an intellectual race much superior to
our own is growing stronger every
year. In proportion as astronomical ob
servations become more and more pre
cise.
A woman thinks there is something the
matter with a man who refuses to argue
with her. '^HnBH
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, DECEMBER 31, 1905.
MANX TRIEVES
ELUDE POLICE
Break Into the Government
House and Empty It of
Nearly All the Furniture
LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR OF ISLE
OF MAN, WHOSE HOUSE WAS
RECENTLY ROBBED.
LONDON, Dec. 30.â 1f Hall Calne were
addicted to comedy he might find mate
rial for a funny situation in something
*that has Just happened in his beloved Isle
of Man. Burglars have emptied Govern
ment House of nearly every stick of Its
furniture, and in consequence the Lieu
tenant Governor, Lord Raglan, has to
stay in lodgings until the place can be
fixed up for him again. The spoils taken
away by the thieves amounted to several
van loads, and it says little for the vig
ilance of the Manx police that such a big
haul could have betn made undetected.
The Manx Legislature only a little while
ago completed the building of a new Gov
ernment House, for which Lord Raglan,
according to the agreement, was to pro
vide the furniture. He did it In style, but
apparently as fast as it was taken In at
one door the enterprising burglars re
moved it by another. When his lordship
arrived to take possession, intending to
give a big house-warming party, for
which scores of invitations had been Is
sued, he found its halls practically bare.
What he said on making the discovery is
not recorded, but as he has been in the
army and is as familiar as Kipling with
barrack-room expletives it may be taken
for granted that he did ample Justice to
the situation.
The Governorship of the Isle of Man 1 is
one of the snuggest sinecures within the
gift of the crown. In additional to an of
ficial residence rent free the lucky In
cumbent gets a salary of $9400 a year. Its
bestowal on Lord Raglan exemplifies the
Scriptural saying, "To him that hath
shaH be given." Because his father com
manded the British army in the Crimean
war he receives a pension of $10,000 a
year. There have been few wars that
have been bungled through in worse
faehion than the Crimean, â¢ but that did
not moderate the gratitude of the nation
toward the field marshal who succeeded
in getting it finished. Besides the pen
sion, the nation presented him with a
fine residence. The pension runs' for only
two lives, but it has already cost the
treasury $500,000, and as Lord Raglan is
only 48 years old it' is likely to cost a good
deal more before death terminates it.
Because he was the son of . a distin
guished father Queen Victoria appointed
Lord Raglan a page of honor when he
was but a boy. In those days a royal
page had the privilege of passjng through
Sandhurst, the great military academy of
England, practically without having to
undergo any examination, and thereupon
obtain a commission in the aristocratic
Grenadier Guards.. It Is to Lord Raglan's
credit that he turned out a fine soldier
in spite of the way the path was smoothed
over for him..
As orderly officer to Sir Robert Phayre
In the second Afghan war he narrowly es
caped the coveted Victorian Cross for ral
lying a wavering body of "men demor
alized by seeing their leader killed. Lord
Raglan led them up the height, routed
the Afghans and then calmly reported'
himself to the general:
He was for two years Under Secretary
for War at the War Office, and they were
not wholly happy ones for him, for he
found that much-anathematized depart
ment in a state of chaos.' The permanent
staff, the "barnacles of ; Pall Mall," did
not take kindly to the criticisms of the
Under Secretary, and he was glad to re
linquish the rather ungrateful office for
such a soft snap as the Governorship of
the Isle of Man. He is a fine figure of a
man, standing well over ' six feet, and
with an eye as keen as a hawk's.

STOCK MARKET
IS UNSETTLED
Last Business Day of the
Year Proves to Be an Act
ive One on the Exchange
SoxÂ¥E RAPID DECLINES
Great Confidence Expressed
That Money Stringency
Will Be Soon Relieved
NEW YORK, Dec. 30. â The last day
of the year proved a very active one
on the Stock Exchange, but the tone of
the market was considerably unsettled.
There was a disposition to realize the
profits shown on the wide advances
of the last few days and to escape the
risks of the remaining uncertainties
over thÂ«j, money market. The absorp
tive poifrer of the market, however,
proved good, and the realizing was
effected \u25a0 without material damage to
prices. There were some -. decidedly
feverish movements in the closing deal
ing's; when ljasty throwing over of
holdings cruised a number of rapid de
clines, followed, in some cases, by
rapid recoveries. The range in Amal
gamated Copper and Anaconda was
especially wide and rapid.
The Immediate outlook in the money
market seems .much obscured. The
greatest reliance is placed for t'arly
relief from stringency on the disburse
ment of the dividend and interest due,
for the -payment, of which great funds
have been accumulated. The severity
of this week's stringency la 'attributed
principally to this preparation. It is
believed also that the accumulation of
resources by the trust companies for
the purpose of "window dressing" for
the January 1 statement of their con
dition, which is required of those in
stitutions, has played an important part
in the contraction of the week's money
supply, and prompt relief is hoped for
from the release of funds accumulated
for this purpose. On the other hand,
there is some apprehension that very
heavy obligations contracted in the
course of the speculation may fall due
next week, especially in the foreign
exchange market, and will require to
be met or renewed.
HKAVY I,KM)IXG BY BANKS.
There was much discussion of the
probable effect on sentiment of the De
cember charges for interest which will
go out to the customers of Stock Ex
changft commission houses next week
and which, it is believed, will disclose
a high average of carrying charges.
Little attention was paid to the bank
statement, which conformed pretty
closely to the expectations in the cash
change. The heaviest lending by the
banks is supposed to have been dono
toward the end of the' week, and thus
would have a diminished effect in the
average changes for the week as a
whole.
Total sales of., bonds, par value,
$1,970,000.
Speculation has maintained a buoyant
confidence this week in face of the se
verest stringency of the money market
and of one or two episodes that would
have been seized upon to upset confidence
in ordinary times. The eagerness of the
speculation after chafing impatiently un
der the constraint of the high money
rates and some degree of forced liquida
tion broke through all repressive Influ
ences, and there was a rush to buy stocks
at rapidly, rising prices. The demonstra
tion was unprecedented in the experience
of the oldest operators, and was viewed
with unaffected amazement and some de
gree of irrepressible anxiety. The rates
paid for money on call at the Stock Ex
change reached 110 per cent, and 125 per
cent was paid privately.
RISE IN THE 'MONEY BATE.
In times past such a rise in the money
rate has precipitated heavy liquidation of
stocks, and even in the full tide of a ris
ing market "has turned prices abruptly
downward and thrown the market Into
panicky conditions. The ' most notable
precedent was that of December 18, 1899,
when animated speculation for the rl3e
was Interrupted by the outbreak of the
Boer war and heavy demands upon New
York for gold by London. The exhaus
tion of bank reserves here, which resulted
in the necessity for calling In loans, ran
the rate for money on call up to 186 per
cent and forced a spasm of liquidation of
stocks to recuperate the banking position.
This week's rate for money was, the high
est touched at the Stock Exchange since
that time.
In September of 1902" the strain on the
overextended speculative position did not
carry the rate higher than 35 per cent. In
the panic of May, 1901, precipitated by
the Northern Pacific corner, the highest
rate quoted was 75 per cent ' On all of
these occasions the running^ up of the
money rate was the signal for Indiscrim
inate unloading of etocks^the rate of in
terest being regarded as* prohibitive of
holding of Btocks on margin.
In strong contrast with these precedents
the speculative position has been firmly
maintained this week, and rates for
money formerly regarded as prohibitive
have been paid by speculative holders.
Various motives may be distinguished to
make up the - obstinate confidence '. with
which the speculative position has been
maintained. Underlying them all is the
conviction that he conditions of prosper
ity in' the country at large, already be
yond all precedent, are destined to a fur
ther indefinite expansion. It is asserted
that an enormous potential but waiting
demand for securities exists in the coun
try, which will be ; incited by the grow
ing evidence of this prosperity, and which
will develop in the stock market when
the seasonable requirements of the money
market are satisfied and when funds be
gin to flow back into the channels of the
bank reserves. .^;;'^v
AWAIT FORCED SELLING.
It is the conviction of the followers. of
speculation that the great capitalists , of
tho country have organized their forces
and \u25a0 provided ' themselves with * means In
dependent of the exigencies of the call
money market, to take advantage of any
forced selling on the part of less fortunate
holders to: accumulate "securities. :
The expected coming demand for stocks
is relied upon to absorb present holdings
arid to; advance prices to an^extent that
will pay for the fraction of ; one per cent
per - day, which present, interest 'rates
amount to In addition to the prices now
paid for stocks, i The position Implies re

market,~as was done in the period of
stringency of 1902. A tacit agree
ment was allowed among banks and
great money lenders to restrict the
rate demanded on standing call loans
until the passing of the crisis. These
factors combined to protect the stock
market from damaging consequences
from the stringent money market.
CAUSE OF THE STRIXOEXCY.
The cause of the stringency is sum
marized as great activity in trade and
expansion in enterprise in all lines,
delayed outgo of cotton and grain
shipments by railroad freight conges
tlon-" which limits the supply of for
eign exchange, the pressure on for
eign money markets' because of the
Russian situation, which discourages
the drawing of exchange in anticipa
tion of merchandise exports and the
unbridled demands oi' the stock specu
lation coming on . top of an already
over-extended credit position. The
soundness of the foreign business sit
uation is without question and the
Chicago bank troubles last week and
those at Memphis this week have not
Impaired the feeling of confidence.
But the clearly defined opinion exists
that the speculative extensions at this
time in face of the strained money sit
uation exceed in boldness and daring
anything in the modern ' history of
speculation.

RARE PAINTINGS
GO TO MUSEUM
Property Left by Capitalist
Yerkes to New York City
Said to Be Worth .ss,ooo,o oo
NEW YORK, Dec. 30. â When Charles
T. Yeckes, the capitalist, who died yes
terday, made his will several years ago
he announced that he had left his col
lection of pictures and objects of art
â¢and his two houses at Fifth, avenue
and Sixty-eighth street in this city to
the Metropolitan Museum of Art. This
property is worth about $5,000,000. It
was said yesterday among his friends
that this provision of his will remained
unaltered.
Among Yerkes* most treasured pos
sessions is a collection of Oriental rugs
that is said to be the finest and most
costly in the world, even exceeding in
value and beauty the collection of the
Shah of "Persia or that in the British
Museum. These rugs are twenty-three
In number and are hung upon the walls
of a gallery that Yerkes had built espe
cially for them. Several years ago he
had the designs copied in their original
colors and reduced to book form. The
paintings are comprised in a set of ten
volumes, one- of which was to remain
in the Yerkes collection and the nine
others to be presented to the most fam
ous museums of the world. Each rug
was copied separately and each paint
ing is about two feet long.
Among the rugs is the "Holy Car
pet," for which Yerkes paid $60,000.
Some of the others are represented as
almost priceless treasures. In 1897
Yerkes purchased and rebuilt the large
mansion at Fifth avenue and Sixty
eighth street. In this he put his col
lection of paintings, said at that time
to be the most valuable private collec
tion in this country. He also bought
the house adjoining his in East Sixty
eighth street and made the two into
one. The architect described the first
and main house as costing $600,000, its
furnishings $500,000 more, which, with
the cost of the lot, made the total near
ly J1.D00.000. Yerkes* painting* at that
time were valued at $1,500,000 and have
been greatly added to since.

outcome of the experiment. \u25a0 The sister
hood in the church is greatly Interested,
and the largest delegation. ever present at
a diocesan convention is expected to ap
pear. : Every parish or mission Is entitled
to a representation of five women, exclu
sive of the male delegates usually ap
pointed. ! .
The house of churchwomen will legis
late from the beginning under prescribed
canonical authority." It must first enact
rules of procedure and elect officers and
designate their special prerogatives.
There will be some interesting moments
at the session, it is expected, and some
of the old-fashioned church people in the
diocese, who are disposed to look askance
at the radical departure, are preparing
for the worst. Throughout the diocese
the election of delegates has been the
occasion for â¢ considerable feeling, and
competition for the honor of sitting In
the first house of churchwomen ever
known has been keen. Among the dele-
' gates are names of many matrons known
throughout the State for activity in
church and philanthropic work and In the
social world..

SACRAMENTO, Dec. 30.â According to
William L*nd. a. director, of the State
Agricultural Society, millionaire hotel
owner and former Mayor of Sacramento',
the affairs of the agricultural society
are in bad Bhape, and he told Governor
Pardee to-day he desired to h,e relieved
frcm further service at the earliest date
possible.
Director Land said the work of getting
the new State Fair grounds in order
cost the society JH.OOO more than Archi
tect Allen had figured, ar.d the society
was In debt to that amount. He -told the
Governor ' that he protested against al
lor.-ing bills beyond the means of the" so
ciety, hjut was outvoted by tho otiper di
rectors. He felt he should no longer be
obliged to serve on the State Board of
Agriculture. / V ?&\'.i
Governor Pardee informed Director
Land that the debt of $14,030 in establish
ing" the new fair grounds was r.uch as
might be incurred by any State body in
such an undertaking, and he felt that
the board should not be condemned until
it had the opportunity to -prove its abil
ity to handle ths State Fairs. He said
the exposition next year should determine,
whether the fair as an institution Â°phould
be preserved or abolished. It was the
Governor's opinion that the present fault
of the manappment is ..that it is too cum
bersome, and it is difficmt to centralize
authority. . ...
FTvÂ« or six vacancies in" the board xvill
occur in a month or two, and the gov

VALLEJO, Dec. 30. â At the annual
gathering of Â° the California State Fed
eration of Labor, which opens in Oak
land on Monday, the delegates from the
Vallejo Trades and Labor Council will
ask that the insane asylums of this
State be investigated as .to their treat
ment of patients andÂ° the attitude
toward union labor. At the meeting
of the Vallejo council last night F. W.
Grigsby. delegate from the Carpenters'
l*:iion and formerly an employe of the
State- Hospital at Napa, made an ad
dress and presented a great deal of evi-.
d^nee tending to show mismanagement
at the Napa institution. \u25a0"â-\u25a0'
Grigsby declared Â«that union labor" is
being discriminated against at the hos
pital: that persons not citizens of this
country and who were not residents of
California for a year previous to their
appointment, as required by the law,
are holding positions at the, institution
near this city; that patients partially
rational are â¢'f.-.rmed out" as laborers
to nearby ranches and that the men
are compelled to carry their food from
the hospital kitchen. He declares the
State is not receiving any returns from
this labor. Grigsby wound up his
charges by declaring that the Napa in
rJtuation ls a hotbed of graft.

SACRAMENTO, Dec. 30.â A direct at
tempt was made to-day : to bribe Governor
Pardee. The Governor received a letter
from C. O. Whitehouse of Bagdad,. Ky.,
saying his brother, W. H. Whitelibuse,
was serving 'a term of six years at Fol
som prison, and asking ' what sum the
Governor would accept to let him. out.
The writer said he realized the Governor
did not want to take money to influence
his official acts, but that it must have'
cost him something to get elected and
the money would recompense him on that
account. He added that nobody in Cali
fornia would be the wiser if the Gov
ernor pardoned Whitehouse, and that he
would return to Bagdad and settle there
without occasioning comment.
The Governor wrote in reply that he
was sorry Whitehouse was not; in this
State so that he might begin criminal ac
tion against him for attempted bribery,
and that he would endeavor to bring
him to account. even in Kentucky. He
further declared that under no circum
stances would he now consider an appli
cation for mercy for the brother of the
writer and that the latter could inform

Governors are not the kind of men they

French Presentation of the
Eecent Moroccan Contro
versy Eegarded as Unfair
EEPLY TO BE MADE
Germany Will Show That
She Did Not Threaten
the Paris .Government
BERLIN, Dec. 30.â The Foreign Office
will issue next week a book on the Mo
rocco controversy containing, documents
omitted by the French Government from
its yellow book and correspondence, re
peating the accusation of bad faith made
against Count yon Tattenbach-Ashold, the
former special German representative at
Fez. The whole case, from the German
standpoint, will be placed before the pub
lic. Such a book on a European diplo
matic question has never, been . issued by
the imperial Foreign Office, which, unlike
other Foreign Offices, ha 3 followed Prince
Bismarck's rule never to publish such
papers, but to hold foreign disputes in ab
solute secrecy.
France's yellow book, however, pro
duced an effect on yie world's opinion
that the German Government is not will
ing to let go unanswered, and the deci
sion taken to disregard the former
policy and publish documents in rebuttal
of France's presentation, which it re
gards as that of a partial attorney deter
mined to arrange the facta- so as to pro
duce a conclusion held in view from the
beginning. The German Government re
sents especially the statements designed
to produce ths impression that Count yon
Tattenbach-Ashold has been untruthful.
"The book is expected to clear away
some impressions abroad that Germany
threatened France.
PARIS, Dec. 30.â Despite the improve
ment in the relations of France and Ger
many, occasioned by the submission of
the Morocco controversy to a" conference,
there is a distinct revival of war rumors
and a considerable element of the people
and a number of journals are maintain
ing that war between France and Ger
many Is inevitable. Some of these reports
are taking an exaggerated form, but they
all tend to stimulate the public apprehen
sion. The Patrie publishes a report that 1
the Bank of France has taken extraor
dinary precautions, similar to those
adopted In 1870 before the Franco-Prus
sian War. This is authoritatively denied.
Dispatches , from Belgium _ say the au
thorities there . are adopting precaution
ary measures, anticipating that a con
flict would reach Belgian soil. Specials
from Switzerland report that the German
reservists have been summoned and other
dispatches graphically describe the activ
ity of French and German forces along
the frontier and their extensive works
and defenses.
These reports, it is said, are the out
growth of the recent Hrench yellow book,
showing the acuteness of the Franco-
German, issue over Morocco ajd the ap
proaching" Moroccan conference, In which
the issue will be renewed.
The agitation has produced two distinct
elements, one holding that neither of the
governments desires war, and will make
the necessary concessions to avoid it, and
the other insisting that Germany has lat
ent designs and that Franco Is surely be
ing drawn toward a conflict. The pessi
mistic element justfi now is uppermost,
and its sentiment is reflected in a series
of alarmist reports.

Pedro Alvarado Ls Likely to
Become Wealthiest Man
on the American Continent
STILL GKOWING KICHEE
Five Carloads of Ore From
the Palmillo Mine in Chi
huahua Net Him $700,000
Special Dispatch to The Call.
PARRAL., State of Chihuahua, Mexico.
Dec. 30.â The goddess of fortune, not sat
isfied with raising Pedro Alvarado from
the level of a poor peon to a multi-mil
lionaire in less than six years, has again
opened the way. whereby he seems des
tined to become one of the wealthiest
men on the American continent. .The
Palmillo mine, which Senor Alvarado dis
covered and which has produced his great
wealth, is ! growing richer and richer as
the work upon it progresses. A short time
ago a great body of ore, which, so far
as present appearances go, is almost In
exhaustible, was struck. The ore in this
latest "strike" is so rich that it is put
direct into the "parting" apparatus In
stead of through the regular furnaces of
the smelter. Five car loads of this ore
brought Senor Alvarado a net return of
$700,000. It is stated that if Senor Alva
rado 'should iSO choose he. could mine a
carload of this rich ore each day, thereby
obtaining a revenue of about $125,000 a
day, but he does not rush things, and
two or three carloads of the ore a'week
will satisfy him.
It is stated by H. J. Douglas, the aud
itor of one of the smelting companies in
Mexico, that his company alone has paid
Senor Alvarado $3,200,000 for ore which
it purchased from him during the past
year. How* much he received from the
other smelters is not known. V'-'~;
There have been many lurid stories told
and written about Alvarado. He was not
as ignorant as â¢ some people think when
he discovered the- mine that has brought
him fortune. He was very poor and had
been working in mines in the Parral dis
trict at 35 cent 3 a day. His parents, how
ever, were far above the average peons
in matter of intellect, and he had some
education. Those who have had dealings
with him say~ that he is a good business
man, although he has done many remark
able things since he began to amass his
millions. It Is true that ue built for him
self near Parral a grand home that-- is
almost a castle In size and appearance.
i It cost him. fully one million dollars to
build and furnish it, and it Is said to be
the finest residence in Mexico.
According to another report there is a
piano in every room, In the house.
Whether this is literally true is . not
known, but it is a fact that he purchased
a large number of pianos, and had them
placed in"*his new residence. The story
that he chartered a special . train to take
him to the City of Chihuahua two or
three years ago for the purpose of having
some dental work done upon his teeth 1c?
true.
It is believed here that the widely, pub
lished .report that Senor Alvarado .had
offered to pay the public debt of Mexico
grew out of a remark that he made to a
banker of thi3 State that the mines of
the country should contribute to a fund
for that purpose. Senor Alvarado holds
the view that as he obtains his wealth
from the ground a good part of it should
go to the support of the Government,
Senor Alvarado is said to be not a great
believer in banks. It was currently re
ported at one time that he had several
million dollars of gold and silver coin
stored in a strong steel cage at his resi
dence, and that it was constantly guard
ed by a. strong force of armed men. It
is thought that he does keep a large part
of his many millions In a vault at his
home, but the story of a guard of armed
men being constantly on hand is a myth.
Several million dollars of Senor Alva
rado's wealth- has gone to aid the poor
and for works of charity and religion.
He erected a magnificent Catholic cathe
dral here at his own expense.
The poor people of Parral have good
cause to hold him in, kind remembrance
for the pleasures and comforts that he
brought to them on tnis Christmas as
well as on Christmas days of former
years.
< Notwithstanding the fact that Senor
Alvarado is fond of certain kinds of dis
play and ostentation, he is kind and mod
est. He never intrudes himself upon any
one; he lives a very simple life, despite
his great riches, and, above all. he never
lets himself forget that he was once
poor. \u25a0

JAMES C. CRAWFORD
ll was not an Innate aversion to vocal
music that uiadetFr.itz Martens writhe as
he kept solitary midnight vigil in his
Falcon, C 34 Commercial street, for he is
a most energetic member of- a local Bu
sang verein. Nor was it the sentiment
contained in the song assailing, his ears
thfit harrowed his soul, for he had a
weakness for. tender lyrics. The fact that
he fc-as a Teuton, and the offending ditty
of Celtic tenor, cut no figure in the jarring
cf his nerve centers, for he was un
wedded to any special school of melody.
Consequently his irritation 'could only
be ascribed to the inartistic manner in
"My Irish Mollie. O," was voloed
yy the evidently masculine person in the
iodgir.g-house above stairs.
'\u25a0Yon'd o somepotty shtop hira?" groaned
Mr. Martens, solus, as "the raucous
mouthlnps continued -and with increased
vehenser.ee. There was only one of two
ways. for Mr. Martens jto escape the per
secutionâeither to shut up shop and flee
beyond earshot or to visit the vocalist
atifi silence him. Adoption of the former
alternative, might involve pecuniary sac
rifice,' as late tipplers were abroad, and
tne latter plan might c bring upon the med
dler cither oral or "physical abuse, *or
both, as the author of the .ear-torment
was apparently in no condition to tamely
hearken to logical pleadings. Mr. Mar-
Jftjps was carefully-- weighing the ques
tion in his irlzid when a terrific- rciar
of ,"My Irish M-o-M-i-le. O." provoke 4
hizn to instant decision.
"He'll shtop id," soliloquized the suf
ferer, arming himself with a club and
an empty quart bottle, "und 'mine peesi
Â» ness voa'd be der looser, cider."
He scaled the stairs and, guided by the
voice of the music-murderer, entered the
chamber occupied by Edmund Schrenck,
who was abed, with uplifted knees form-
Ing a canopy of the coverings, and lustily
lading the atmosphere with maddening
discord. What immediately ensued was
variously recounted to Police Judge Mo
gan, before whom Mr. Martens was ac
cused of battery by Mr. Schrenck, whose
head was so lavishly bandaged that only
the ends of his scraggy mustache were
visible.
Mr. Martens averred that when he po-

litely requested Mr. Schrenck .to v cease
outraging- harmony he was rnstantly at
tacked by that gentleman and that in
self-defense he was compelled to strike
back. Mr. Schrenck, on the other hand,
testified through an aperture in his head
swathing that without uttering a word of
either displeasure or warning Mr. Mar
tens fell upon him and piled both club
and- bottle, the result of the onslaught
being the necessary cloth-wrappings there
.exhibited.
When the case is recalled for hearing
nex| Friday, seme of Mr. Schrenck's fel
low lodgers will testify as to the quality
of his rudely interrupted vecal solo.
Mrs. Hattie Martini, accused of having,
donjolntly with Charles H. lAwson, stolen
a pearl necklace and a fur boa from the
boudoir pfÂ° Mrs. May Hess, keeper of a
lodging-house at 271 O'Farrell street, told
Judge Conlan that at the time of the al
leged robbery she was under escort of
Mr, Lajvson J6 the Grand Opera-house.
"We saw Nan-ce O'Neil play 'Queen
Elizabeth.' " said Mrs. Martini, "and I
have the seat .coupons to sho\y for it."
(Seat coupons submitted In evidence by
defense and scoffed at as immaterial by
prosecution.) "On our way home," con
tjnued Mrs. Martini. "Mr. Lawson picked
up a fur tall that had been dropped from
somebody's bos, at Third and Market
streets, and I told him to throw it away,
as it might tÂ»e dirty. Why he kept It I'm
sure I don't know."
As the fur tafl alluded to was Identified
by Mrs. Hess as a portion of the boa pil
fered frdm her, and ss Mrs. Martini and
Mr. Lawson lodged at Mrs. Hess' house
and had free .access to her private cham
ber, the prosecution depends upon the
"tall to clinch its case.
The fact that the <ail emits a perfume
similar to that used by Mrs. Hess is an
other point Judge Conlan will weigh ere
he hands down a decision next Tuesday.
It was the erection of a stovepipe by
Timothy O'Keefe, grocer and saloonist at
Twenty-third and Alabama streets, that
primarily led to his wrecking of a well
ordered home and his arrest for peace
disturbance on complaint of his wife.
The defense claimed that if Mrs.
,o'Keefe had refrained from volunteering
instructions as to how the stovepipe
should be erected her husband would not
have lost his temper and smashed things,
including the sjove, but Judge Mogan In
timated that it would be unwise to estab
lish a precedent making a wife's Inclina
tion to command her spouse reprehend
ble. inasmuch as such inclination could
not be curbed by statute.
Mr. O'Keefe was doing as well with
the stovepipe as any man could have
done, the defense then pleaded, and
would hayÂ« triumphantly set it in place
If Mrs. O'Keefe had not insisted that
his plan of procedure was opposed by
every plain law of mechanics. When
he gently remarked that perhaps she
would like to relieve him of the job
and accomplish it herself she fervent
ly regretted she was a woman, thus
Implying that If she were a man she
would fix the stovepipe as she had
suggested. It was not until he had
tried her proposed plan and found It
absolutely impracticable that he
waxed wroth and began his work of
demolition.
Mrs. O'Keefe clinched the prosecu
tion by testifying that if Mr. O'Keefe
had not been intoxicated he would not
have been angered by her well-mean
ing advice as to how the stovepipe
should be put up, because he had
often, when sober, passively adopted
her ideas as to how' pictures should be
hung-.
He was pronounced guilty as
charged. â¢

"Take a peep at this, Judge," said Har
ry Monahan, whisky drummer, pointing
to a crimson streak behind his right ear
and thus insinuating that Jt was made by
a finger nail of his wife, Okella, who ac

home, 804 McAllister street.
Mrs. Monahan, a pretty little woman,
(old the court that the defendant shame
fully abused her and their young child,
an Invalid. Although he knew the family
dinner hour was 6 o'clock, he willfully
stayed away from home until 8 o'clock,
and when she complained of his unneces
j sary tardiness he struck her and ran out
of the house. He was seldom sober, she
added, o

I me to drink." said* the defendant.
"Then if your business necessitates 111
treatment of your wife and child you
would better engage in some other busi
ness," said the Judgr. "You are guilty of
Lattery and I'll sentence you next Tues
day."

STOCKTON. Dec 30.â A warrant was

Mrs. Margaret Crowley's . person
comfortably filled the capacious wit
neEs chair in Judge Conlan's court as
she testified that Martin Fannon, whom
she accused of peace disturbance, was
as good a boarder as any landlady
would desire to have if he would only
abstain from drinking intoxicants to
excess. For seven consecutive years
he had been one of the mainstays of
her caravansary. 3021 Clement street,
when he became addicted to tippling,
and then his nature seemed to under
go a. complete transformation. He
called her unprintable names and
otherwise annoyed her and the other
boarders, and she would like to have
the court compel him to change his
place of residence. Her reoiuest was
complied with, the Judge notifying
Mr. Fannon that if his personal ef
fects are not removed from Mrs.
Crowley's house before next Tuesday
he would be sent to jail.
"He called me out .of my name," plead
ed Mate Charles Blum of the ship Church
111, when he was called to receive sentence
for having battered a dock watchman
named J. H. Rex. Smiling grimly Judge
Mogan responded:
"And the misnomer so shocked your
sensitive soul that your fist involuntar
ily shot out and felled him?"
"Yes, sir," readily replied the "bucko
mate."
"It was the same fist, I suppose," his
Honor pursued, "that is reputed to have
felled innumerable mariners who Incurred
your displeasure on the high seas?"
No answer. \u0084- "A;.> \u25a0â¢>',
"Of course," continued the court, "if
you had been in the habit of accom
panying your blows with epithets you
would not have been so profoundly horri
fied by what this complainant called
you?"
Not a word spake the forecastle terror.
"The sentence of this court is that you
pay a fine of $30 or be imprisoned thirty
days."
An extremely buxom dame Immediate
ly advanced to the clerk's desk "and de
posited thereon one double eagle and one
single eagle. "Is that enough?" she
asked, fingering a lot of yellow disks in
her wallet. "Because if it ain't there's
plenty more where it came from."
"That's enough, I puesa," rumbled from
the mate's lips, and the clerk nodded af
firmation.
"Then you come on," quoth the lady,
In commanding tone, and the man whose
frown made stalwart seamen quail
meekly followed her from the courtroom.

SANTA CRUZ, Dec. 30.â Charges of
malfeasance in office against Constable
A. L. Seldlinger of Boulder Creek were
to-day dismissed by Judge Smith of the
Superior Court. "The charges, which were
brought by William F. Pierce, a Boulder
Creek â¢ saloon-keeper,' include allegations
that the Constable kept articles taken
from prisoners, failed to stop street
brawls and refuged to serve writs of at
tachment on certain persons. Judge
Smith in his decision declares that al
though many grave charges were made
against the Constable, there was not
enough evidence brought out at the trial
to overcome the officer's well supported
denials. ;" C '

Half an hour before the first heat
Hazel Patch ran over a man who was

the mix-up. The horse was bruised,
but otherwise - uninjured. The man
was seriously hurt. Hazel Patch, be
sides winning the $500 purse, received
$175 extra on an offer of the Fair
Association of $50 for every half sec

2:07, made by Zolock on Tuesday.
In the 2:17 pace, Paul D. Kelly, a

Special Dispatch to The Call.
SEATTLE, Dec. SO.-Dara Stewart, a re
cent arrival from the north, shot at Hilda
Davis, a variety actress, in the Detroit
Hotel at 7 o'clock to-night, and then
turned the weapon on Frank Thomas, who
was in the room and who interfered to
save the woman. The bullet aimed at the
woman went wide of its mark. The one
intended for Thomas narrowly escaped
his head. Stewart was insanely jealous of
the woman because she would not marry
him. Thomas grappled with Stewart,
while the woman attacked him with a wa
ter pitcher and beat him into insensibility.
That Stewart intended to murder the wo
man and commit suicide was apparent
from a note in his pocket; which read :
-"Bury us together. One shall rise from
the dead, the other shall pass into ever
lasting habitation. "
The Davis woman met Stewart at Fair
banks. He proposed to her and she re
fused. Stewart found her in a dance hall
. Friday night. He again renewed his pro
posals and she repulsed him.

THRONG GREETS
JACK O'BRIEN
Conqueror of Fitzsimmons
Is Greeted by His Friends,
Reinforced by a Band
PHILADELPHIA, Dec. SO.â Jack
O'Brien came back to town to-day. On
the train he was touched for a $2500
check, a wallet containing $100 in real
money and a stickpin valued, by his
valet, at $250.
O'Brien wired San Francisco to stop
payment on the check, but he laments
the loss of the stickpin, which was a
gift from a host of admirers, more than
the loss of the money. When the con
queror of Fitzsimmons stepped off the
train he was seized by a crowd of
friends who hoisted him on their
shoulders and made a triumphal march
to the street, where a band in a tally
ho and a line of carriages were wait
ing. The crowd swelled to several
thousand and Philadelphia's native son
was obliged to make a speech before
the procession moved.
Jack thanked the. assemblage for
their demonstration with his charac
teristic ease and -fluency of language.
MODI2L YACHTSMEN AWAIT
SOME FAVORABLE BREEZES
Lack of Wind Haa Caused the Post-
ponement of Quarterly Regatta
on Three Occasions.
The model yachtsmen have been
compelled on three consecutive Sun
days to postpone their quarterly re
gatta on account of a lack of wind.
Two heats were sailed, one by each
section, but at a meeting of the San
Francisco Model Yacht Club held last
week it was decided to sail the regatta
over. ' . \u25a0 . .*'\u25a0\u25a0..
Donovan's Witch won the heat sailed
by the first section. As there are five
boats in this section the Witch was
credited with four points. The Presto,
owned by Stone, finished second, and
thereby earned three points.
In the second section there are six
boats. The only heat sailed: was won
by Henry London's Imp. Roeckner's
Apache was second. The latter re
ceived four points and the Imp five.
Another effort will be made to hold
the races to-day. Â§ With a good northr
west wind the regatta could be com
ple'ted' In, one afternoon. In . the two
sections are the following boats:
First sectionâ Brown'fa San Francis
co, Petersen's Petrel, Brannan's Alice,
Donovan's Witch and M. London's
Cricket. ' Â« \:
Second sectionâ H. London's Imp,
Seavey's SprayÂ» Donovan's Florence,
Roeckner's Apache and O'Donnell's
Neptune.
Each section ; will : sail three heats
and tho boats scoring the mo-st points
in the â¢ sections will meet in the , finals.
The winning boat, [together with the
winner of the Washington's Birthday
regatta will have the right to chal
lenge Peter%en's Stella for the . Dickie
Perpetual Challenge Cup. The Dickie
Cvp 1 race is scheduled for February 25.
J. Brannan is building a new model
to be called Ruth. It will be com
pleted in a' week or so and will be
launched, two. weeks from .to-day. .. The
measurements are seventy-two . inches
over all,'! fourteen-inch 'beam and
seven-inch draught.-. Brannan believes
his new boat will prove a speed marvel
and he figures on winning many, races
with her.

California Polo Player Is
Accompanied by Menzies

HUKLINGHAM IS STEONG
These Two With Neil Haig
and F. J. Mackey Will
Prove a Formidable Team
Special Dispatch, to ThÂ« Call.
NDW YORK. Dec. 80.â Francis J. Caro
lan, the well-known polo player of San
Francisco, who with Mrs. Carolan has
been in England for eight months, where
he played a great deal on tho famous
polo grounds, arrived to-day on the Celtio
of the White Star line. â¢
With Mr. Carolan were two famous
British polo players, F. W. Menziea and
Captain C. P. Wood, who are going with
him to San Francisco. Â»
Captain Wood was given the "distin
guished service order" for brilliant work
during the South African campaign. He
said Mr. Menzies will remain in Califor
nia about ten weeks. Mr. Carolan said
that Frank J. Mackey, the veteran Cali
fornia polo player, who . has a big estate
at Leamington, England, and is known on
every polo ground in Great Britain, will
arrive shortly, with Captain Neil Haig of
the Irish Dragoons, who is one of the best
polo men in the British army. These two,
with those mentioned, will compose the
Hurlingham team which 1 will play against
the Burlingamo quartet of California.
They will prove exceptionally strong, and
it will be difficult to make up a team at
Burlingame or elsewhere which can beat
them.
VISTIMS TELL
OF THE HAZING
ANNAPOLIS, Dec. 30.â Two midship
men of the fourth class, Isaac N. Mc-
Crary of Calvert, Texas, and Gaylord
Church of Meadvllle, Pa., testified posi
tively before the court-martial this aft
ernoon that Midshipman Stephen De
catur Jr. of Portsmouth, N. H., a mem
ber of the first class, had hazed them
on different occasions^ Decatur will,
according to his counsel,, go .â¢;. on the
stand on Tuesday, when the court will
again meet, and deny_under oath every
statement -which the two underclass
men made incriminating him. As the
evidence of each of . tiie prosecuting
witnesses was to separate incidents
and entirely uncorroborated, there is a
possibility that the evidence be
considered insufficient to convict, but
the apparent fact will remain, should
the latter make the denial promised,
that a perjurer is wearing the uniform
of a midshipman of the United States
navy.
Decatur was arraigned this afternoon
and pleaded not guilty to every charge
and specification. Midshipman . Me-
Crary was then called and testified
clearly and positively that he had been
hazed by Decatur, who, he said, had
sent for him to come to Decatur's room.
There tie had ordered him to stand on
his head In the closet, and he had done
so until he was exhausted. Decatur
next compelled him to do "No. 16," and
then he was ordered by some one, pos
sibly not Decatur, he said, to perform
the "leaning rest." All of these exer
cises were continued until the witness
could do them no more. The witness
showed the court the manner of per
forming 1 the two exercises. In "No. 16"
the hands were placed on the hips, and
the body lowered and raised byjt>end
ing the legs outward and straightening
them again. In the "leaning rest" the
hands and feet were placed on the floor
with the body rigid, and \the body
raised and lowered by bending and
straightening the arms.
This was designated as "No/ 7" in the
specifications, but .was apparently a
blunder. McCrary was rigidly cross
examined, but his story was not shaken.
Finally he said, in answer to a ques
tion, that he would not believe Decatur
If he swore that he had not told him
to stand on his head and perform "No.
16." -V-^r" \u25a0
Midshipman Church testified that
Decatur had ordered him to stand on
his head, but he was not so positive as
McCrary, and admitted, that he might
be mistaken. These were the only wit
nesses for the prosecution.
The remainder of the session was
taken up by witnesses who testified to
the good reputation for truthfulness
enjoyed by Decatur. - Those; who gave
this testimony were Commander W. F.
Fullam, Lieutenant Commander Ed
ward E. Capehart, Professor H. P.
Huse and Midshipman Lawrence D.
Stewart and Charles E/Hovey. * -
Decatur's counsel stated that the ac
cused midshipman will go on the stand
Tuesday and deny specifically every
statement to the eff ect> '"' that â¢â¢ he had
hazed either MoCrary ; or Cnurch and
that there would be evidence ' offered
tending to establish an alibi.
Trenmore CofUnt Jr., whose trial for
the alleged hazing of Midshipman J. P.
Kimbrough was concluded yesterday,
was before the court for a brief period
and heard the record of yesterday read
and approved. It ( is practically con
coded that; Coffin has been convicted
and will be dismissed.'
Charges have" been filed against Mid
shipman . Worthwright ' Foster of New
Albany, Ind. It is specified in his case
that he hazed Midshipman Roberts of
Joliet,. 111., by compelling: him to get

NEALON CLEVERLY WINS
THE FLOOD HANDICAP
Charlatan,, the Favorite, Is Away
Poorly and Finishes Third.
FRED E. MULHOLAND
Not even rain, hail or the prospect of
picking winners out of the slimy, ooay,
slushy . going with grappling hooks
could deter a large, chattering, . purple
faced crowd of the faithful followers of
racing from bidding "Adiosl" to Ingle
aide yesterday for^the season.
The parting from the track wai de-
Void of tears or affection. In fact, the
great majority acted as If they didn't
care If it novar opened up again. An
Arotio breeze fanned the course until
the riders, fidgeting "about at the post
with their mounts, were possessed of
> as much action as a Lake Tahoe trout
frozen In a cake of ioe. The talent
more than held Its own though, as
I three public choices finished first. Suc
ceed, Nealon and Yellowstone were all
accorded support.
BAD START FOR CHARLATAN.
Starter Jake Holtman also had a slide
I on the ice when he gavo the favorite.
Charlatan, such a bad send-off in the
mile handicap. Jake ducked the shower,
of snowballs with the best possible
grace and endeavored to do better.
Charlatan, with Treubel up, had a de*
cided call in the betting and when the
barrier flew up the brown colt' was
turned; partly sideways. Overtaking
I'm Joe easily, Loague rushed Sir Ed
ward to the front, but .the latter
couldn't stand the pressure. Barney
Schreiber's good colt, Nealon, with
Radtke in the saddle, grabbed' the
leader about a furlong away, - winning
band-ridden only at the .tape by two
and a half lengths. The favorite stood
a hard drive, and, though leg weary and
blowing, took the show from Tenordale.
GRASSCUTTER FAILS BACKERS.-
A,Futurity course selling sprint for
two-year-olds, the curtain-raiser, wit
nessed the complete downfall of
Grasscutter, an 11 to 10 favorite.
When the barrier;, was released Mc-
Brlde beat it fully three lengths with
Succeed/while the first choice got
away all tangled up. Succeed experi
enced little difficulty in beating Avon
ella and Spring- Ban â¢at the finish.
Syphon Girl ran well to the stretch,
where she began backing up.
When it comes to packing a ton of
coal or towing a cargo of gold bricks
Blumenthal must be counted in on the
deal. In the welter-weight six-fur
long selling affair Louis Ezell's black
gelding opened favorite and receded to

Procrastinate is about a ten-pound
better horse in the mud than on a dry
track. Again ridden by Radtke. the
odds about the gelding were tightened
up from 7 to 5 to 9 to 10, and he won
the third event pricking his ears. Laura
F M finished an easy second over
Esherin.
If the ring had not been soused with
Yellowstone money, the defeat of Wart*
Nlcht would have meant a good break
for the books. It so happened the
subway delegation hammered Yellow
stone down from 6 to 4. Tommy Clark
got him away sailing to a ragged start.
The good thing was straight enough
at the wire, but Bock on Warte Nlcht
could only get to within a length of
him. With an Intelligent rids Cloohe
dOr could have won.
Summers & Co.'s Bob Ragon is Â«.
virtuoso and no mistake when the foot
ing is damp. ; He was piloted by the
colored wizard, Leroy' Williams, in the
last, and at 7 to 5 'won under a wet
sail. Instructor ran second, a quarter
of a dozen lengths in front of Tommy
Griffin's Critical.
<! NOTES OP THE TRACK.
Radtke piloted two winners.
After winning on Blumenthal "BU
Bill" Knapp discarded the silks for
street attire.
Twenty-nine bookmakers made the
weight.
On Tuesday next at 1 o'clock Billy
Magrane will sell three two-year-olds,
bred at Antrim Stock Farm, in the pad
dock at Oakland.
Associate Judge Pettengill received
a letter recently from C. J. Fitxgerald.
The noted ex-starter stated that hÂ«
would pay California a visit early in
the new year.
Charley Henshall held a leveo in the
paddock yesterday. Charley's horses
have been at Ingleside for some time,
while their owner has busied himself
wrestling with the Ascot Park game.
J. L. Ross, the bookmaker, secured
Yellowstone, after hiking the entered
selling price from $500 to $1000. To
fill the vacant stall W. P. Fine then
claimed Warte Nlcht for $825.
Procrastinate has displayed such ex
cellent mud form that Charley McCaf
ferty thought he would make a valu
able addition to his string. Tanner
& Co., however met a $400 boost with
the necessary $5 bid to retain.
It's strange how badly fooled horse
men can be at times. The stable
thought Hainault one of the best bar
gains on the counter and the brown
gelding was heavily played both at the
track and in the city poolrooms. He
trailed with the leaders for about half
a block and then fell back to last po
sition.

wits were sharpened and good nature In
creased.
There was an impromptu programme.
Â«uch as no theater couid boast, for the
artiFts performed just out of good fellow
ship. The programme and the fun lasted
into the -early morning.
The only period where a little serious
ness was allowed to interrupt the fun was
when John McXaught. president of the
club, was presented with a beautiful read
ies lamp in appreciation of the Interest
he has taken in the club and what he has
done for it. The. presentation speech was
made by Attorney "Billy" Barnes.
Liouis Stelimann. th-e poet, read a paper
on New Year's resolutions. In contrast
with many attempts to do something new
In this line, Stellmann's attempt was a
screaming success. The paper was illus

Frank Keane. .:....â¢:
Haig Patlgian, the well-known local

NEW YORK CAPITALIST. WHO HAS BEEN ELECTED PRESIDENT OP THE
UNITED RAILROADS IN THIS CITY. SUCCEEDING ARTHUR HOLLAND,
WHO HAS RESIGNED AND WILL RETURN EAST.
Patrick Calhoun was elected president
of the United Railroads system yesterday
in place of Arthur Holland, who sent in
his resignation as chief executive of that
corporation some three months ago.
Mr. Calhoun Is the largest individua*
stockholder In the company, owning one
third of the stock.
It is not expected that Mr. Calhoun will
make his residence here, as he has many
interests scattered throughout different
sections of the United States that demand
his attention, but it is his intention to
make frequent visits to this city to keep
the system" up, to the times.
Following the meeting of the board of
directors of the United Railroads a ban
quet was tendered to Arthur Holland, the
retiring president of the company, at an
uptown restaurant. The entertainment
was a handsome affair. The hosts and
guest of honor eat at an Immense round
table, laden with great clusters of holly
branches and long-stemmed Christmas
chrysanthemums.
Charles Holbrook was tbastmaster of
the occasion. During the banquet a mag
nificent solid silver meat service was pre
sented to the guest by.Tirey L. Ford on
behalf of the employes and officers of the
company. Nearly everybody present made
a short talk, but there were no speeches
of a formal character.
Those present were W. M. Abbott, F.

FORMER COLLEGE MEX TRY
THEIR HANDS AT ACTIXG
Members of the University of California
Club Successfully Present a
One-Act Skit.
. The members of the University of
California Club started off early last
night to welcome in the New Year. A
good attendance gathered In the cozy
clubrooms and celebrated the evening
with jinks and a one-act skit : entitled
"The College Wld."
It was the first attempt of the mem
bers in histrionic art, and it can safely
be said that they made good. Though
named somewhat similar to Ade's clever
piece the skit was entirely different in
plot. The author tried to picture the
great sport as It may be in the future
when the reformers of the game, get
in their work. E. M. Hecht, cast in the
role of trainer of the team, showed
himself to be very capable in portray
ing the tough act. Gus Keane as an
athletic girl was real lady-like. The
cast was made up of the following
members: Gus Keane, Lester B. Chem
lnant, Paul Castelhun, Harry L. Pad
dock, E. M. Hecht. G. H. Taubles, Mark
H. White, R. J- Nicholls, W. B. Conklln

Henry Hobson Finds One

Patrol men Eun Down Henry
Braun, a Daring Footpad,
Pointed Out by the Salt
For nearly three weeks Henry Hobson,
a sailor on the United States transport
Thomas, searched the city to locate three
men jj who had held him jup and robbed
him on the Ingleslde road. \ Last night
Hobson's efforts were rewarded and he
discovered Henry 'Braun, the man who
had ransacked his pockets, at the corner
of Grant avenue and Market street. The
latter was arrested by Policemen Klssane.
and Drlscoll after a long chase and
booked at the City Prison on a charge of
robbery. â¢ jâ¢ ;
Three weeks ago Hobson was walking
along the Ingleslde road, when he , was
confronted â¢by three men. Two of them
were armed and held pistols at* the 'sail
or's head. A third man went through the
victim's pockets and took i about $60 in
coin and a gold watch and chain valued
at about WOO. Hobson said nothing about
the affair after he reported. lt to the po
lice, but he started a systematic search
about the city for the , culprits. , None of
the men were masked and Hobson had a
good opportunity to '\u25a0\u25a0 study/ their coun- 1
tenances. He started 'out from Uhe ship
each, night -with but a small. amount of
'money In his pockets and visited the vari
ous resorts In , the tenderloin' and on . the
Barbary Coast. He had about $700 on
deposit in \ %he safe aboard the Thomas,'
and he determined to spend it all, If
necessary, in bringing the. thieves to" jus
tice.
Last night Hobson ? started out on his
usual mission. He visited different points,
of interest, and was about, to, return *;tb:
the ship when he sighted Braun/ on Mar
ket street. He called | Patrolmen Klssane
and Drlscoll, but when Braun / saw the
two officers approaching him " In ' company
with Hobson he took to flight. The chase
lasted nearly three blocks. Near, the cor
ner of - Turk \u25a0 Braun was captured and
even then offered resistance. After being
handcuffed he was sent to- the .Central
station," where the charge of robbery was
made against him. - ; i-

ANGELO NAPOLI
IS CONVICTED
Jury Brings; in a Verdict
of Murder, butEecoinmends
That Court Extend Mercy
ACCUSED IS' UNMOVED
Judge Cook Will Pronounce
Sentence Next Saturday
and Defense Will ; Appeal
The big clock of the Hall of Justice
wasvslowly clanging the noon hour \u25a0 yes
terday when Hugh Fraser* elected spokes
man of 'the jury trying Angela ; Napoll
for the murder of Giuseppe Brogardo,
rose to his feet, gray-haired, long-bearded
and patriarchal, and to the question of
Judge Carroll ; Cook solemnly answered,"
"Yes, your Honor; we have arrived at a
verdict." . '.
He passed a slip of yellow paper to the
clerk cf the court, who passed it on to
the Judge. Upon this' bit of paper, the
scrawl of which :held the fate -of a mani
the Judge glanced rapidly, returning It to
the clerk. The clerk; standing up, read
with loud voice, "We, , the jury :In the
case; find the defendant guilty: of murder
in the seaond degree and recommend him
to the mercy, ot the court." . â¢
Napoll -.was sitting below the clerk, his
Fedora hat crushed between his
'strong hands, and the words that were
pronouncing his guilt fairly cascaded upon
him. He gave a quick upward look as the
clerk . began, and when ;the reading had
ended he was still staring upward blank
ly. He had not understood. : He then
turned to A. B. Treadwell, his counsel,
who sat next to him, and peered up into
his face questioningly,. with an expres
sion, almost simian, of confidence and
trust. Treadwell repeated the verdict to
him in a whisper,* and Napoli sank back
into his chair, seemingly satisfied. . It'is
doubtful if even then he understood, but
to hear the thing in the .voice of his de
fender was evidently a relief, robbing
him of fear. ,-' '.; :
WI FE H E AR S VERDI CT.
Behind, within the outer railing, sat the
wife of the accused. /All morning, as
during the entire trial, she had sat there,
humbie, poorly clad, lacking In beauty,
her dark eyes fixed upon her husband In
simple adoration. And when . the clerk
had pronounced the words that made of
the father of her children *"a convicted
murderer, she was still there, motionless
her eyes still fixed in that look of wistful
respect and love. She also, probably, had
not understood.
The court convened at 10 o'clock
and it was 10:30 when Judge Cook be
gan his charge to the jury. This lasted
only half an hour. The Judge went
over the cardinal principles of criminal
law." He emphasized the â¢ doctrine
which says that an accused must be
convicted only if therels no reasonable
doubt of his guilt. He defined the dif
ferences between murder in the first
or second degrees and manslaughter.
He charged the Jury to give credit all
testimony, even that of the accused, but
to give it importance in proportion to
the clearness IJ and > apparent candor of
the witnesses. â¢"".".- - : '
Napoll listened to the charge far
more attentively than he had listened
to the arguments' on the previous} day."
Once, when Judge" Cook, in 'defining the
different degrees of murder/ said, "For
murder in the first degree death or;im-;
prlsonment for life is the penalty," the
prisoner's eyes .blinked/ rapidly and
grew moist. . * ./' .':
WAITING FOR JURYMEN.
At 11 o'clock the charge* was fin
ished and the jury withdrew to the lit
tle room at the back of the court; for
deliberation. Judge Cook employed
the time In hearing =motlons from coun
sel in other; cases. Napoll sat at the
central table withln> the" outer railing,
seemingly unconcerned. Once he po
litely handed to an attorney who was
leaving-, after securing a postponment,
the tall shiny, silk hat which he had
left on the table. From the jury- room
came no sound, only at : intervals a
shadow passed behind the glazed-glass
door,' the s"hadow probably of .the juror
that was collecting, the votes of his fel
lows., At 11:30 o'olock the buzzer of
the jury-room sounded. Bailiff Abe Solo
mon went into the Jury-room, .came out
again almost immediately /and whis
pered something to Judge Cook. " The
Judge shook his head negatively, the
bailiff returned to the jury-room, popped
his head in,' then out again, and re-^
locked the door. George F. Wells, the
clerk :of - -the court, ,. asked â Napoli;
"How's everything?" "I don't ; know,",
answered Napoli,' with an open' gesture
of both hands, a shrug and a smile.
NAPOLI BOASTS OF 'STRENGTH.
Later Napoll, wearied with the wait,
began to talk to bystanders .; about
himself. He said that \u25a0he had traveled
with the wrestler Muldoori f pr, four
teen 4 years and was still the champion
of the world .at 145" pounds.. He told
of -having' killed an : 800rpound bear
with his hands once in ; New; York. He
was then I engaged in .a wrestling act
on -the stage with the , bear,' whose
claws ."; were encased in gloves. >. The
gloves slipped : off and the bear, began
to : claw Napoli in^ the throat/'maklng
wounds, of which he showed the scars
to" :the -listeners. \ Napoli seized the
bear by'the lower ; part of the body! and
pitched; him Toff -the. stage, breaking his
back apd killing him. ... V
\u25a0 Ati 11:45: the jurymen's buzzer . be
gan to sound again 'for; the final time.
There ,waÃ "a singular, delay.; about the

"The Suicide of Pierre La

: Sensation Among Parisians
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LONDON. Dec. . 30.â Among: those
who take, an interest in literary mat-"
ters. ; the topic: of .the moment, in this
country is the recent: /marriage \u0084of., of .
Theodore ' Watts- Dunton. the famous
critic and authorl of "Aylwin." The
event is of special Interest partly be
cause" of the fact that, though the dis
tinguished critic and author is over
60, his bride is only 23, and partly
because of the changes which it' will
cause in one of the most celebrated
literary households in England. ' This
is,; of course, the mansion known as
'The Pines" in the London' suburb of
Putney, where for; over thirty years
the author of "Aylwin" and .Charles
Algernon . Swinburne, the greatest liv
ing English poet, have lived a life of
practical seclusion.
"For many years Swinburne's physi
cal condition has , made the presence
of a- devoted friend \ practically a ne
cessity to him, and "Wattls-Dunton has
been that .friend, .The two distin
guished authors have been friends
ever since their, youth, and when
Swinburne's mother died she left the
author of ; "Aylwin".' a large sum of
money, with the pathetic request , that
ho would be responsible thenceforth
for his famous . comrade's welfareâ -a
trust that' Watts-Dunton at once^ ac
cepted and has loyally carried out. '
Of recent years visitors to "The, Pines"
have been few.: the two authors having
been at home only to some of their old
est - literary acquaintancesâ Thomas Har
dy,"- Alfred Russel Wallace and George
Meredith among the number. Swinburne,
particularly, seldom, quit his famous li
brary, which is one of the features of
"The Pines" and contains over 10,000 vol
umes. . . ':' .
SEW DOMESTIC ARRAIV GEMEN'T.
The former Miss Clara Reich," who Is
now Mrs. Theodore Watts-Dunton, Is -a
pretty and accomplished girl of Putney,
who, as a child, was a favorite with
Watts-Dunton. , Several ;! years ago she
became his amanuensis and also won' the
regard of his famous comrade at "The
Pines." The news of her marriage to the
writer, who is \ nearly forty years her
senior, came,' however, as ,a -, srreat sur
prise to the acquaintances of both par
ties. .
It was supposed at first that the cele
brated comradeship between Watts-Dun
ton and Swinburne would now be sever
ed, but Instead it seems that Mrs. Watts-
Dunton will only make a third in the
household of "The Pines.", To make this
new domestic arrangement possible, the
adjoining house has been taken, wherein
the celebrated Swinburne library will be
installed, but^otherwise will
go on as ;befofe, except that the former
"bachelors' hall" of the two . famous
writers will be presided over by a woman.
Probably Theodore" Watts-Dunton Is
now best known v as the author of "Ayl
win," his famous story of gypsy life,
which was; published eight years ago,
though long before Its appearance the
author had won worldwide fame as a
poÂ«it and critic. The friend of Borrow,
Watts-Dunton edited ; "Lavengro," â¢ was
associated with Leigh Hunt and later on
with William Black in ""The Examiner."
Now he Is the chief reviewer of the Athe
naeum, which is the most dignified and
authoritative literary journal in this
country. ' Watts-Dunton wrote "Aylwin"
when he , was only 25 years old," and It re
mained unpublished for so many years
only because its author never dreamed
that it would be successful. The romance
Is now in its twenty-eighth edition, and
was the only modern hovel included in a
recent edition, of classical works.
NOVEL CREATES SENSATION.
: .Across tha channel everybody- is; read-
Ing a new, novel called: "The Suicide of
Pierre Labrique," which has such an in
genious plot and is so well done gener
ally that it-Is pretty, sure to be translated
into English before -long.
Written" by : Jean ] Jullien, "The Suicide
of ; Pierre '{ Labrique" is all about a " de
spondent young poet's attempts to .oblige
the authorities to assist him in quitting
an ' unappreclatlve world. .Pierre " La
brique is ;the- versifier in question. Ho
has gained enough recognition through
his poetic works to convince him that, he
is a genius, ; but -the public declines to buy
his | books, so in w order , to ] avoid starving
to death he determines to ! commit hara
kiri in an original way. '\u25a0' -

banker- named Hurelle, whose "corpse
was -pitched out "of a train '\u25a0near, the

but; the. murderer was never brought to
justice,"; and Labrique plans to gef him-:
self | executed in the unknown assassin's .
stead, Sor in a Montnfartre caf e. where
several reporters are ; gathered, the poet
asserts that Hurelle was murdered
only., for the. money In his pocket,and
the trouble begins.; Several . papers an- ,
nounce at once that -the. Hurelle affair
will soon be ; reopened, -;and . Pierre ; hjm

,1 r. Arrested on a Charge of
Grand Larceny Is in Jail
. * - \u25a0 .
An unlooked for development in the
Â«:^se of John H. Ott Jr.. who Ss wait
ing: his preliminary examination in
I'olice Judge Conlan's court on a
charge of grand larceny on complaint
of Frank Johnson, occurred yesterday
morning. Chief Dinau received a let
ter from .Tames I. Donaghy, captain

fect that prior to October 13 there
v.as a contracting firm In that city, J.
11. Ott &. Co.. of vrhleh Frank John
son and J. H. Ott Jr. were partners;
that they obtained goods of the value
of between $1500 and $2000 by false
pretenses and disposed of the goods.
Captain Donaghy wrote that he held
warrants for their arrest and to hold
Ott and arrest Johnson. Johnson was
arrested by Detectives Bunner and
FreeL
Johnson and Ott came to this city
and were living together in a house
on Howard street on November 21, ,
when. Johnson alleged, Ott took $1100,
the amount of Johnson's savings, from
the latter'e trunk and fled. Tire po
nce found that Ott had left by the
Santa Fe Railroad and he was arrest
ed at AlbuQ.uero.ue, N. M. He was
brought back by Detective Freel. | He
made a statement that he had given
the $1100 to Deputy Marshal Jordan at
AlbuQuerque and Jordan had hidden it
In a ahed In the rear of his house.
The Chief of Police and the Mayor of
Albuquerque were communicated with, ]
but no trace of the money could be j
fousd and Jordan denied that he had >
ever seen the $1100.
Mayor Weaver of Philadelphia has
an intereat In Ott. as Ott was at one
time a member of his Sunday-school
class. Weaver wrote to Mayor Schmitz
asking for particulars as to the crime
with which Ott had been charged.
Mayor Schmits sent the latter to Chief
Dinan. who furnfshed the particulars
and a reply was sent to Mayor Weav
er* letter on December 11.

GRAIN BROKERS
HAVE A FROLIC
Celebrate Passing of the
Old Year and Coming lii
of 1906 With
Great hilarltv followed the closing pro
ceedings of the business year at the
Merchants' Exchange yesterday. It has
been the custom for many years to speed
the parting year and tq welcome the
incoming at the exchange. The grain
brokers have been the leaders, generally,
in the fun, which is fast and furious.
The character of the outbreak yesterday
that marked the departure of the busi
ness year of 1905 was no exception. There
were frantic shouts of glee, and the air
was filled quite completely with flying
produce.
Beans, wheat, barley and other sample
substances were made Into missiles, and
the younger members on 'Change had a
busy time dodging and repaying compli
ments In kind. Nearly an hour the fun
wa3 afoot. Grain trays were hurled and
the tables upon which they had reposed
were thrown about The climax was
reached when a large jar of asafoctida
was capsized on the floor of the Ex
change. | The odor of this drug was the
"loudest" feature of the sport.
The floor committee had made some
rules in .advance to limit the roughness
of the demonstration, but If any one ob
served these rules the observance was
not noticeable. Finally, when the - brok
ers and others were tired with their ex
ertions, there ' seemed to be general
agreement that the celebration of the out
going of 1905 and the incoming of 1906 had
received due and full recognition and
peace followed. i'-'i^X'

FALL HEAVILY
Northern Section of Coasit
Gets a Large Supply >of
Greatly Needed' Moisture
The rain was general .yesterday along
the coast, from Fresno north. The show
ers had not reached Southern California
at dark last. night,: but McAdie thinks the
people of the citrus belt; will get all the
moisture' they need to-day. Snow fell
heaVily in the high â¢ Sierras. - The . winds
were strong oft shore and in the Sacra
mento Valley. The velocity attained at
Point Reyes and at the Farallones ex
ceeded fifty miles . an hour at times. Tho
sea was exceedingly rough, but* as . the
Weather Bureau had Its storm signals up
at 8 o'clock yesterday morning, it is
thought the mariners had plenty of time
to escape all danger.
The heaviest rainfall was reported from
Red Bluff, where half an " Inch of rain
descended upon the town In a few hours.
In San Francisco the precipitation was
.32 of an inch. Between 1:30 and 2 o'clock
the floodgates opened and the city was
deluged. During five minutes of that time
.07 of an inch of. rain fell. The gutters
were all overflowing and every one took
the dry places when possible. The wind
at this period was whirling through the
streets at the rate of thirty-four miles
an hour, so that umbrellas were useless
for protection.' The southern section of
the State was visited by severe frosts.
but no damage was done.
Professor McAdie says to-day will be
rainy throughout the State and holds out
no hope of pleasant weather for the first
day. of the glad new year.
Benson's Demurrer Overruled.

Mrs. , Mary Daniels of 427 Lombard

about Â« o'clock on i.: Friday evening.
She was found by -' three small boys
early yesterday morning, lying. In \u25a0 the

streets. She was removed to the Har- ;
bor Hospital and there^ told a thrilling
yarn about having" been 7 hurled from
thÂ© porch of a house on the .top. ',of
Telegraph Hill, of a frantic sllda down
the almost perpendicular cliff and of a
long night of exposure, during whloh
she lay helpless In -the * rain and \u25a0 called
vainly for assistance. I',; â¢ ;
The woman's did not bear
out her story : of a fall from the. top
of the precipice, and, although the po
lice made a, thorough Investigation
they found no reason for believing
that she was- thrown from any : porch
or that she even called ; at any house
in the vicinity of the cliff at the foot
of which she was found. Her hus
band, who had been searching all
night for his wife. waÂ« at the Har
bor Hospital shortly after she . reached
there. He says she has been suffering
from Insomnia and 'that her Â«ilnd has
not been normal for some months. He
thlnks she tried to climb the cliff,
slipped before she had gone very far
and fell to the ground.
The surgeons at the hospital found
that Mrs. : Daniels * had sustained a
slight contusion of the back, an abra
sion of the left thigh and a : . slight
laceration of the scalp. 'More serious
than any of the injuries were the ef
fects of the all-night's exposure. She

COLLINS MUST
STAY IN JAIL
His Efforts to Obtain Bonds
or (J et Reduct ion in the
Sum Have So .Far Failed
ADOPTS FINAL ' ".RESORT-
Makes an Appl ication to Hie
Supreme Court for Habeas
Corpus Writ for Release
Attorney George D. . Collins - t will be
â¢forced, much against his will, to remain
in the County Jail till next Tuesday, be
ing unable to furnish the necessary bonds
of J15.000 on the second indictment filed
on Friday evening, charging \u25a0 him wjth
perjury. He has applied to the Supreme
Court for. a writ of <. habeas corpus, with
the object of getting the bonds reduced,
but the application will not be heard till
Tuesday. "
Aftor Collins was arrested on Friday
evening on the second indictment Attor
ney McPike called upon Judge Lawlor
and asked if he v.ouldnot consider a mo
tion to % t educe the . bail. MePike. said he
would probably take the matter before
the Supreme Court. :
When the first case cf perjury was
called in Judge Lawlor's court yesterday
to be again set for trial, January 15 was
suggested/but Collins*- demanded an im
mediate trial, and finally January S was
agieed upon. The Judge asked if a return
had been made on the bench warrant on
the second charge, and being informed in
the affirmative ordered the indictment
placed on open tile.
The Judge then asked if it w^s the in
tention to make a motion for a reduction
of the bonds, and Collins replied that his
attorney h Â«J- decided to take the matter
before ;the., * &reme Court. Collins asked
if he woulitr Be allowed to go to the office.
of .the . Aetna Indemnity' Company in
charge of a deputy sheriff to arrange for
his bonds. The Judge granted him per
mission, and said that. as he had made an
examination -a.s^to the of the
company when he accepted the previous
bond 0f. 515,000 there was no need of any
further, examination.
\' Meanwhile Attorney McPike had filed
an application for a writ of habeas corpus
before the Supreme Court, but: only three
Justices were presents It was necessary
to get another Justice' to make a quorum,
so the matter, was put over till Tuesday.
Collins declared that the "three Justices
were willing to issue. the writ, and is au
thority for the statement that they ex
pressed the opinion that $2500 in each
case was sufficient.
Collins called at Judge JLawlor's cham
bers yesterday afternoon and said . that
the, indemnity company would not go on
his : new bonds, as the collateral given
them on the first $15,000 bonds would not
justify any further risk. He had no other
source' to apply to and must -remain in
jail. He asked permission to visit the law
library to-day, but the Judge told him he
was in the^custody of the Sheriff, and the
Sheriff was the proper person to take ac
tion:

Letter That Drove John' A.
Miller \to End Life Is
Believed to Have Been
Intended for F. J. Millar
MYSTERY OF OPENING
OF .ANOTHER'S MAIL
Missive Has Been Lost and
Man Whom It Was Meant
For Is Wondering AVhat
Grim News Awaits Him
Last Thursday afternoon in the south
nave of the ferry building John Augustus
Miller of Providence, Pa., shot himself
through the head and died almost instant
ly. On his person was found an envelope
across which he had scrawled, "This let
ter made me desperate." Yesterday after
noon F. J. Millar, a 'late arrival from.
Dixon, 111., staying at the Hotel Termi
nus, the same hotel where John Augustus
Miller, the suicide, had a foom the day ha
shot himself, called in great excitement
at the Coroner's office. He said that the
mail that he had had addressed to him
at the: Hotel Terminus had *been opened
and taken by mistake by the man now
dead. A hasty, perusal of the envelope
across which John -Miller before shooting
himself had scrawled, "This letter made
me desperate." showed instantly that it
had been addressed to F. J. Millar and
\u25a0came, not from Providence, where the
dead man lived/ but from Dixon. 111.,
where now lives the wife of F. J. Millar.
So that it seems established "that the let
ter which caused Miller's despair and
drove him to suicide was not addressed
to him, was not written by any one he
knew and that he) went: to death under
some : hideous ' mistake. '
. LETTER Ol' MYSTERY GOXE.
The mystery of the affair is all the
deeper from the fact that the letter which
drove, to death* a man for'whom it^was
not meant exists.. no longer. The search
made on John Augustus Miller, after his
death, and through his belongings, failed
to discover the letter. Only the envelope
which had inclosed it remained, with its
despairing sentence. ' Andjiow F. J. Miffar
of Dixon, 111.,.; is asking, himself, "By
whom' was that letter, written. What did
'that letter contain?"
And in suspense! he is wondering
whether a replicator that letter is not
even . now speeding .by train to him
with its news^r tlijj.t drives men to
death. And " perhaps far within him
he wonders in- fear what will be his
act when it reaches him. Will its
meaning be such as to mako of life
an .unprofitable and grievous thing,
worthy only of being snuffed out? ~.
HOW 31 ILL All LEARXS TUUTH.
The manner in which F. J. Millar
learned of this strange imbroglio is al
most, a tragedy in Millar, com
ing from his home in Dixon. 111.,
reached' San Francisco Thursday and
took" a; room at" the Hotel Terminus.
He knew when he started- that he was
going -to stop there, and he had told
, his., wife; "\u25a0 who is in Dixon now, and
his friends there to address their" let
ters to the Hotel. Terminus. Tester
day a telegram was received at the
hotel asking information about .'his
suicide. The telegram came from his
wife and _was^ an answer to another
telegram That' she ' had received from
San Francisco announcing his death.
The sender of this: telegram is not yet
known, but,- of course, it. was to the
suicide of John Augustus Miller that
he referred. Hastily reassuring his
wife by wire, Millar then found that
letters: addressed to him at the hotel
had been opened by mistake by the
man that is dead.- Immediately rush r
ing to the Coroner's office, he found
that the letter itself that had ?. sent
John Augustus Miller -to suicide had
been -meant for- him. And now he is
wondering.

VACANT PLACE
IN HIGH COURT
Gossip Among Politicians
Relating to \u25a0 Appointment
of Tan Dyke's Successor
PAEDEE'S OPPORTUNITY
Lawyers mention the fact ,that, not one
of the Justices of the Supreme Court of
California hails from San Francisco. It
is therefore asserted jhat the Governor
would not make , a mistake if he should
select as Justice.- Van. Dyke's successor
some able lawyer of this city,
v ."W.'C. Van Fleet of this city served one
term onUhe Supreme bench, but he was
defeated for re-election in 1598. Ralph C.
Harrison of San Francisco was also an
Associate Justice of the high. tribunal, but
he failed , to obtain renomlnation for an
other 'term. The. notion thaw Superior
Judge Carroll .Cook desires appointment
to succeed the late Walter Van Dyke; is
misleading. It' would cause no .surprise,
however, if he should develop a deal of
strength as a candidate for the Supreme
Court or the Court of : Appeals of this
district at the Republican nominating
convention of 1906.
Politicians in the Republican camp are
saying that. Governor Pardee has now
an opportunity to adjust affairs in Ala
meda,, County â¢In a manner that would
gratify Judge Melvin and Senator Lukens.
It is said that he, could appoint Justice
Hall of the Appellate Court to the Su
preme bench and then appoint Judge Mel
vinHo the Court of Appeals. It Is an open
question, however, whether Justice Hall
would accept N the * promotion. He might
consider that a full term on the Court of
Appeals would be more desirable than the
unexplred-term of four years an -the Su
preme.bench.
- It : is , the common impression- that, the
Governor will look carefully over the field
of - aspirants 'in Southern California , and
' appoint'- some ionÂ«"r from.; the place where
yen Dyke lived Twhenhe was nominated.
Reports to the effect that the Ruefters
of San Francisco are; getting ,in line 'to
' Buppbrt J. .; O. Hayes of ; San J<Jse for the
| nomination for Governbr may somewhat
; diminish the of Justice Lorigan
forrenomlnation ,to the. Supreme bAch.
The convention might consider, that a safe
\u25a0Republican '. â¢ county . like Santa .* Clara
; should be â¢ recognized by one Â» place on the
' ticket, but fought C not to : have 'two 'of
/the best places. Hayes ; could not expect
; outside support unless he 'presented some
thinglike a solid delegation' from his. own
county, and a delegation for Hayes might
not be a delegation for. Lorigan. , '
: When locality Is considered Santa' Rosa,
with- Judge Burnett'as'a'candldate,. could
advance the proposition that Jackson.Tem

ALAMEDA, Dec. 30.â For the first time
in the ' history of this municipality tha
flag on tho City Hall flew at half mast
to-day out of respect to the memory of a
young woman, and that one was Miss
Miriam Taylor, the beautiful and popular
daughter and only child of former Stato
Senator and City Attorney Edward K.
Taylor, who met such a tragic end last
night when a saddle i.orse she was rid-Â«
ing ran away with her on Central avenu3
and wirew her to death. As another trib
ute of honor to the youthful departed
City Justice R. B. Tappan adjourned hi 3
' court this morning, and in sympathetic;
; sentence's referred to the untimely taking
'off o? an affectionate daughter and tha
i great bereavement ot a devoted father.
\ An inspection made to-day near the cor
; ncr of Central avenue and Grave street.
â¢ where Miss Taylor was found, with her
1 head crushed and unconscious ' by ". Ed-*
\ ward Hill last night, showed that tha
i youthful rider's skull had not bÂ«en frac-
I tured In falling from her wild mount, but
i that her life went out as a result. of be
ing carried against^ a heavy limb andf
; trunk A>t an oak tree with fearful force. -
Locks of the unfortunate girl"*- brown
hair were found clinging to tha bark of
the tree, having been torn from, her. scalp
in the collision.
â¢ Miss Taylor, although but 18 years of
age, was regarded a* the most daring;
and expert equestrienne In ATameda and!
Oakland, and her mounts were always
high mettled thoroughbreds. Until re
cently she was wont to ride a noted
steeplechaser from the Boots' Stock Farm
and she would take any jump that ber â¢
horse was capable of making:. The young
lady was a skilled hunter and yachts
woman, and when her father owned thÂ«
historic Emerald she was a member of
the crew; and took her trick at the wheel
with seasoned sailors.
During Senator Taylor's term, of 'office
at Sacramento eight years ago his daugh
ter was his constant companion and occu
pied a seat beside him in thÂ» Senate
chamber. She was affectionately termed
the "Daughter of the Senate" and be
came widely known to the legislators thea
at the capital city.
Miss- Taylor's funeral is to. be- held to
morrow afternoon at 2 o'clock from thÂ«
residence of fcer uncle. Judge- M. Btuart
Taylor, 1377 Regent street. The Rev. "WHU
ste Martin of the First Methodist Church
will conduct the services. Interment la 0
be in Mountain View Cemetery.

STEAMER KOREA TAKES
DEPARTURE FOR ORIENT
Russians Sent
Back on the
San Juan.
Trachoma the
Cause of Divid
ing Families.
The delay of the Pacific Mail clerical
force in /getting: papers ready for the
Orient delayed the departure of the liner
Koica yesterday until nearly 2 o'clock.
First there was the regular long wait for
the office mail, which arrived in a wagon
pulled by the famous steed Blanco.
Blanco as usual walked sedately until
JÂ»c reached the outskirts of the crowd
gathered to bid good-by to the Korea's
passengers. Then somebody yelled "Look
out!" Blanco pricked up his ears and his
feet and finished the distance at full gal
lop, spattering mud in all directions as
lie came to a full stop at the Korea's
gangplank.
Tii^re was more waiting, this time for
â¢a il>eeial messenger frcm the office. At
1:1 '\u25a0> p. m. Cai'tain Seabury ordered the
lines cast off and the Korea took her de
parture.
Since she arrived from the Orient car
penters and electricians have made a
number of changes in the Korea's interior
arrangements. An electric light has been
installed at the head of every bunk and
the passenger who desires to read himself
to sleep may now indulge himself with
all comfort. The purser's quarters have
been remodeled for tile purpose of facili
tating the ship's business.
Belore the change was made Purser
Auen had his office in one part of the
ship; one freight clerk was installed in
another part; an assistant freight clerk
was still further away and most remote
of all was the storekeeper. It was like
mrming a bank on Market street and
having the cash drawer on Mission and
the account -ledgers on Howard street and
ueithtr street ear nor telephone connec
tion between the departments. Under the
new arrangement the whole clerical force
is installed in one large office, where the
purser also is located. In addition to fa
cilitating the work this new pian gives
the subordinate clerks an opportunity to
levin the duties oÂ£ the position above
them, and when the time comes for pro
motion the company will be saved the
trouble of breaking in the man advanced
to his new duties.
The Korea's passengers included the
following: 'iÂ£

Princeton Win Relieve Boston.
The United States gunboat Princeton,
which c&me down from Mare Island
the other day and Is now anchored off
Foleom-otreet wharf, will call this
'treek for Panama, where she will re
lieve the cruiser Boston as station
ship. ThÂ« Princeton was herself re
lieved from duty, at the isthmus by the
Boston. Those bluejackets now on the
Princeton who formed part of her crew
when she was at Panama before are
not looking forward to their return to
the isthmus with any particular glee.
There is no shore liberty for Jack on
that station and to be a sailorman on
the Princeton now meant that you
must stay aboard ship for at least
six months after leaving this port.
There is one compensation, however.
No liberty means little opportunity to
spend money and at the end of this
cruise every man on the gunboat will
have a pay-day worth waiting for. It
was at first intended that the cruiser
Marblehead should relieve the Boston,
but the Navy Department has other
plans for the Marblehead, which is
fiow anchored off Vallejo-street wharf.
Challenger Saved by Scuttling.
Further details were received yes
terday from Japan regarding the fire

was beyond control the Challenger
was scuttled and run on the .beach
about seventy miles from Kobe. What
the ship's hose had failed to accom
plish was easy work for the Pacific
Ocean and the Challenger, although
beached, is no longer in danger of de
struction by fire. Preparations are
being made to pump out the water and
it is expected that the vessel will be
floated In a few days and towed to
Osaka for repairs.

EMMONS' CASE
IS A PUZZLER
Briber Free to Leave Jail, as
He Has Never Legally Been
Given Up by Bondsmen
WAITING FOE HIS WIFE
Voluntary Surrender of the
Ex-Senator Not Due to a
Desire to Free Sureties
SACRAMENTO, Dec. 30.â An air of
something approaching the mysterious
surrounds the voluntary location ot for
mer Senator E. J. Bmmons in the County
Jail In this city. Emmons, It will be re
membered, was never surrendered by his
bondsmen and his bonds have never been
presented in court for cancellation. Sher
iff Reese has never been served with a
legal notification of the surrender of Em
mons or with the r,etum of his bonds, and
spends considerable time wondering how
it happens that he has a boarder and not
the scratch of a pÂ«n or a record of the
court to warrant him in holding Emmons.
Emmons was not surrendered to the
Sheriff by his bondsmen or by any of
them. If these is a feeling of unrest
among the bondsmen there is no record
of it In Sacramento County.
Nor Is that all. It transpires that Ein
mons did not come to this city for the
purpose of surrendering himself to the
Sheriff. Emmons said as much himself
to a number of the county officers. It
was for an entirely different purpose, ac
cording to his own statement, namely,
because he expected his wife to follow
him to Sacramento. She has not yet ar
rived here. He voluntarily walKed Into
the County Jail and asked to be locked
up, but It now appears that If the fancy
strikes him he can walk out and his
bondsmen still will be responsible. Such
Is the opinion of Assistant District At
torney J. K. Hughes.
\u25a0> Judge E. C. Hart said: "If Emmons
did not surrender himself for the purpose
of releasing his bondsmen the Sheriff has
no authority to hold him in case he de
sires to get out. and Emmons gave me
to understand that it was for a widely
different reason that ho entered the
County JaiL"

CHICAGO BOARD OF TRADE.
Future Grata and Provisions.
CHICAGO. Dec. 30. â With . the exception of
the first few minutes of trading the wheat
market was strong for . the â¢ entire * day. lAt
the opening \u25a0 local bears sold freely, partly is
a result of lower prices at Liverpool and alao
because of the continued . heavy movement of
wheat ln ' the Northwest. Bull leaders, bow
ever, gave the market good support and prices
soon made a substantial advance. _\u25a0 Later . the
buying became more general because of ' in
creasing outbreaks reported . in Russia, 'it be
ing believed that the situation :there will
eventually lead to a great curtailment of ship
ments of wheat and Othsry grains. ; Further
advices from * Argentina confirming - previous
reports of damage to the wheat crop by rains
also lent strength to the market. An English
statistician estimated - the world's shipments
for *the week at 8,000,000" bushels, against
11,000,000 bushels for the corresponding week
one year ago. This was another feature which
Induced buying. . The market closed firm. T May

were 450 tons, all cars. . . As these car arrivals
have 'largely increased: of late, 'it is reasonable
to infer that " the car - shortage -Is 1 no . longer
acute. '.The circular or Scott & Magner says:
"Receipts of Hay for the week -Just passed
have \u25a0 amounted to 3235 ; tone. . This amount â¢Is
Just about what we have been receiving for
the last couple of weeks. > However, as the- de
mand i lately \u25a0: has been 1 lighter,' " comparatively,
than for some time, the above amount has been
much : more ' than' enough to . supply all \u25a0 current

much .of v a ' holiday character. . \u25a0; Both v* retail

creamery firsts leading all other grades ln de
mand, : as some houses have disposed of all
their cold storage stock and are now using the
creamery firsts. The market Is still reported
ln excellent condlUon for sellers. :
Eggs were lc lower, with weakness reported
in both : ranch and store, though stocks were
still slender.' Eastern and cold-storage grades
showed little change. If the threatened rain
ensues and the weather softens. 'lncreased pro
duction . may . be looked for from now on, and
It is the expectation of these conditions which
renders the market weak.
The Cheese market remains exactly as be
fore. Stocks continue very small.

Dectdnon* aad Citrus Fruits.
Aside from some little extra buying for
holiday - wants ln the early ' trade there - was
very little doing in fresh fruits and the mar
ket was Â» devoid <of feature - and closed weak
for general offerings. Large Navel Orangea
and the big eizea of Grape Fruit continued
nrm under limited supplies, while everything
else, ln the line of domestlo Citrus goods was
in free supply and easy. Mexican Limes and
Japanese Mandarins were well - cleaned up and
a few. remaining Jots were firmly held \u25a0 at the
old quotations. Holders of high-grade Apples
were still asking stiff prices, but the demand
was nothing extra and ' prices were merely
steady. There was practically nothing doing
in cheap Apples. Pears, Persimmons and
Cranberries met with a sluggish demand at
previous prices.

DISGUISED AS A HUNTER
BAKER EVADES OFFICERS
Man Who Led Miss Bowen to
Ruin Trying to Leave State.
Fugitive Said to Be Wandering
Penniless and Alone.
OAKLAND, Dec. 30.â Sheriffs of three
counties have joined In the pursuit of
Louis \V. Baker, the man to whom Miss
Lulu Bowen gave the money stolen by
her from the Postofflce Department, and
the peace officers of Alameda. Santa
Clara and San Joaquin counties have
been directed to keep a sharp watch for
the fugitive printer. Information has
reached the postal inspectors in charge
of the case that Baker, penniless and in
the disguise Â©f a hunter, is endeavoring
to slip through the hands of tÂ»je officers
and escape from the country.
Baker has been traced through Ala
meda County, and from the direction in
which ho was traveling when last seen
it is believed by the Unltsd States au
thorities that he is trying to reach the
southern part of the Sta'.V, or else Is
headed for the vicinity of Stockton.
Those in charge of the case are deter
mined that the fugitive shall not es
cape, and slowly but surely the lines
about him are being drawn closer, and it
is believed that he will" retain his liberty
but a few days more at the most.
The sudden disappearance of Baker,
after the discovery of his connection
with the thefts of the girl postal clerk,
have led to the making public of the
claims of a . large number of people to
whom he owes considerable sums of
money. As his affairs are in a badly
tangled condition, a meeting of his cred
itors will be held Tuesday, January 2,
when an effort will be made to learn just
what thÂ» condition ,of his finances was
when the discovery of his crime led him
to flee from this city.
The creditors will decide upon the best
method of ultimately securing their
money from the printing business left by
Baker when he became a f ugiitve from
justice, and it has been suggested that
the plant be placed in the hands of a
manager, to be run for the benefit of the
creditors until all the indebtedness' is
cleared off.

CURIOS COME
FROM PERU TO
UNIVERSITY
BERKELEY, Dec. SO.â The last ship
ment of treasures from tho ruins ot
Peru Is now on its way to the Univer
sity of California. Professor A. L.
Kroeber, secretary of the department
of anthropology, has received word
from Professor Max Uhle, now in Peru,
that the collection "Is on the way to
California, and with the notice comes
the Information that no more such
shipment will ever be permlted by the
Peruvian Government. On the first of
January a new law goes into effect by
which the Peruvian Government abso
lutely forbids' the exportation of col
lections of prehistoric remains and an
tiquities from the country, all of which,
if excavated by foreigners are hereafter
to be deposited in the National Museum
of the country. The university now
possesses the most carefully gathered
collection, of Peruvian antiquities in
the world and one of the largest. The
entire collection is the fruit of sys
tematic excavations .by Dr. Uhle, . who
Is at the present moment'completing a
second period of two years' residence in
Peru on behalf of the university. This
last consignment from him' will 'arrive
shortly and will be unpacked, cata,
lagued and installed in the museum of
the anthropological department at the
Affiliated- colleges in San Francisco. 1
President Wheeler has sent, through
his private secretary, Eugene R. Hal
lett, greetings of the season to the
press of the State," and with the greet
ings a summary of the more important
developments at the university during
the last year. Secretary Hallett, for
the president, writes:
"The past year j has been an eventful
one for the university. California Hall,
one or the buildings of the greater uni
versity, has been completed; and was
used for the first time as the headquar
ters of the California State Teachers'
Association during its > convention.
The work has progressed onthe.Hearst
Mining -Building very rapidly f and the
exterior is - now about finished. The
building will be ready for occupancy
by the opening of the fall term. A
few months, ago -Mrs. Hearst gave to
the department of anthropology a col
lection of Egyptian and Alaskan ma
terials, which is -valued' at something
over $400,000. The new department of
music has been established and the
university chorus of over 300 voices
organized under the direction' of Pro
fessor.Wolle. The university has pro
gressed and broadened on all lines.
Perhaps the event that augurs - most
for the university of thefutureTislthe
acquisition .of the Bancroft library,
which will make Berkeley the center
for scholarly: research In Western his
tory. As prosperous as has been the
last year,' it is hoped that during 1906
the university may become even, more
useful to the pefcple of the State <6f Cal
ifornia."
The University Chronicle, published
to-day, is devoted to the' printing of a
list of classified names of professors
and Instructors and officials who have
been connected with the institution
since its Inception. -

With Officer Climbing After

Rigging Into Small Boat
OAKLAND, Deo. 30.â Only on the
biograph do pursuits such as Con
stables Lane and Hempstead mad* to
day of a sailor usually take place. Tne
officers of the law chased their man
into the. rigging of a ship, from which
he dropped like a monkey in the tropical
forest, into a. .'boat and was soon pull
ing like mad for the mole, along which
he hoped to escape 'finally.
The next flash of the moving picture
in real life showed the doughty men
of the law aboard a locomotive, flying-,
with the whistle and bell both. going,
toward the head of. the mole, to out off
the fugitive. The* finish showed the
mariner with the two constables sitting
upon him in triumphant glee.
The man who led the officers over
the hurdles In such thrilling manner Is
Andrew P. "Andrews, a tar on the- ship
Clan Buchanan. Edward Mott, a sailor
on the vessel, swore to a complaint
charging Andrews with assault -and
disturbing, the peace. When the con
stables reached the ship,* 'which "> was
lying at the Long Wharf, Andrews
sprang to the rigging and Hempstead
followed him. But from one of -the
yardarms the fugitive dropped twenty
feet into a boat that was moored along-,
side the vessel and pulled himself to
the Oakland mole, while his pursuers
stood helpless on the deck of the Clan
Buchanan. .
Lane and Hempstead went ashore,
and securing a* locomotive that ~- was
standing on the-track, reached the mole
ahead of t,he fugitive. As Andrews
made a landing he was plaoed under
arrest. \u25a0
It is alleged that the trouble grew
out of Andrews' , infatuation for Mott's
wife, who lives in Oakland.

in Favor of Closing the

Tells Committee That Time
for Vessels to Use Big
Ditch Has Not Yet Come
ALAMEDA, Dec. 30. â City Trustee
Frita Boehmer and Manager John H.
Hartog of the Alameda Advancement
Association to-day interviewed in San
Francisco Colonel W. H. Heuer, the en
gineer in charge of the Federal Gov
ernment improvement work In Oakland
harbor, relative to the report that he
was to recommend that the tidal canal
be closed. Colonel Heuer assured his
callers that he never had any intention
of asking the War Department to close
tne bis? artificial ditch connecting San
Leandro Bay with Oakland harbor. He
said that he had made no recommenda
tion to his superior and would make
none unless requested to do so.
When asked if he would recommend
to the War Department that the tidal
canal be opened to navigation and the
three drawbridges spanning the water
way placed In operation. Colonel Heuer
answered that as an engineer he could
not do so now because he does not be
lieve that the time has yet arrived
when the Federal Government should
be put to the expense of maintaining
the tidal canal in a navigable condi
tion. Colonel Heuer lmormed Boehmer
and Hartog that he realized the grow
ing Importance of Oakland harbor and
asserted that when the proper time
comes and when the demands of com
merce and industry require "that the
tidal canal.be opened to navigation he
will not oppose such action. Colonel
Heuer's attention was called to the
dilapidated flooring on the tidal canal
bridges and he said that repairs would
be ordered made.
President W. J. Gorbam of the City
Trustees, who has just returned from a
tour of the Eastern States, says that it
1b of the utmost importance to Alameda
that -the tidal canal be opened to navi
gation.
