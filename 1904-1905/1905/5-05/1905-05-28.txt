is unreasonable for us to expect you to
act- unless we . grve you^ our entire con
fidence." >â¢ -. .... â¢ \u25a0
..'Tagree with you," said.. the younger
statesman.. .:;/ %:1^>,:. ..- .-. .;. .
Holmes, considered for some little time.
"Now, sir, I must ask you more par
ticularly what this document is, and why
its disappearance- should have such mo
mentous consequences?" \u25a0 â¢ /
The two statesmen ' exchanged a quick
glance and the Premiers-s haggy eye
brows gathered In a. frown. \u25a0 ~
"Mr. Holmes, the envelope is a long,
thin one of pale blue color. There is a
seal of red wax stamped with a crouching
lion. It is addressed in large, bold hand
writing to â "
"I fear, sir," said Holmes, "that, in
teresting and indeed essential as these
details are, my inquiries must, go, more
to the root of things. What was the
letter?" ,
"That is a state secret of the utmost
Importance, and I fear that I cannot
tell you. nar do I see that it is necessary.
If, by the aid of the powers which you are
said to possess you can find such an en
velope- as I describe with its inelosure,
you will have deserved well of your coun
try, and earned any reward which it lies
in our power to bestow."
Sherlock Holmes rose with a smile. .
"You are two of the most busy men in
the country." said he, "and in my own
small way I have also a good many calls
upon me. I regret exceedingly that I
cannot help you in this matter, and any
continuation of this interview would: be
a waste of time."
"J believe that no one abroad has seen
it save the man who wrote it.".;- I 'am
well convinced that hi 3 Ministersâ that
the usual official channels have not been
employed."
"But abroad?"
we caught a glimpse of the natural man.
Impulsive, ardent, keenly sensitive. The
next the aristocratic mask was replaced,
and the gentle voice had returned; -'"Be
sides the members cf tbe Cabinet there
are two, or possibly three, departmental
officials who know of this letter. No one
else in England, Mr. Holmes, 1 assure
you."
The Premier nodded approvingly.
â¢'I.nave long known, sir, how high Is
your sense of public doty," 'said he. "I
am convinced that In the case of a secret
of this importance it would rise superior
to the most Intimate domestic ties."
The; European Secretary bowed.
"You do me no more; than justice, air.
Until. this morning I have never breathed
one word to my wife upon this matter."
"Could she guessed?".
"Noy ' Mr. .Holmes, she could not have
guessedâ nor 'could any one have guessed."
"Have you lost any documents before?"
"N0,.61r." .
"Who Is there, ln- England who did
know of the existence of this letter?"
"Each member of - the Cabinet ' was In
formed of it yesterday,- but: the pledge of
secrecy which attends every ; ' Cabinet
meeting was increased -by" the'^ solemn
warning ', which \u25a0 was given ..by,, the : Prime
Minister, ii; Good heavens, to " think ': that
within s, few hours I should myself have
lost it! â¢ His â¢ handsome face " was .' dis
torted with a spasm. ' of \u25a0 despair, and * his
bands tore *at s hls - hair." \u25a0 For a" moment
"No. sir. I had said nothing to my
wife until I missed the paper this morn
ing."
"My. wife had gone to the theater. 1
waited up for her. It was * half-past
eleven before we went to our room." w
"Then for four hours the dispatch-box
"had lain unguarded?" â¢ â¢V; \u25a0
"No one Is ever permitted to enter that
room save the housemaid ' In the morn-
Ing, and my valet, or my wife's maid
during the rest of tbe> day. They are
both trusty servants who have been with
us for some time. Besides, neither . of
them, could possibly have known that
there; was anything more valuable than
the ordinary departmental papers, in my
dispatch-box."
"Who did Know of the existence of that
letter?"
"No one in the house."
"Surely your wife knew?";
"Because the document in question is
of such immense importance that Its pub
lication might very easilyâ l might al
most; say probablyâ lead to . European
complications of the utmost moment. It
is not too much to say that peace or
war may hang upon the Issue. Unless its
recovery can be attended with the ut
most secrecy, then it may as well not
be recovered at all, for all that is aimed
at by those who have taken it is that its
contents should be generally** known."
"I understand. Now, Mr. Trelawney
Hope, I 6hould be much obliged if you
would tell me exactly the circumstances
under which this document disappeared."
"That can be done In a very few words
Mr. Holmes. The letterâ for It was a
letter, from a foreign potentateâ waa re
ceived six days ago. It was of such
Importance that I have never le.ft It in
my Â«afe, but 1 have taken ft across each
evening to my house In Whitehall Ter
race, and kept it in my bedroom In a
locked dispatch-box. It waa there last
night Of that I am certain. I actually
opened <tfce box while I was dressing for
dinner, and saw the document â¢ Inside.
This jtnorning it was gone. The dispatch
box had stood beside the glass upon my
dressing table all night ; I am \u25a0 a light
eleepcr. and so Is my wife: We are both
prepared. to swear that no one could have
entered the room during the night. And
yet- I. repeat. that the paper Is gone."
"What time did you. dine?" â¢
"Half-past seven."
"How long was it before you went to
bed?*' ' . ' -\u0084.'â¢
"When I discovered my loss, Mr.
Holmes, which was at 8 o'clock this
morning, I at once informed the Prime
Minister. It was at his suggestion that
we have both come to you."
"Have you Informed the police?"
"No. sir," said the Prime Minister, with
the quick, decisive manner for which he
was famous. "We have not done so, nor
is it possible that we should do so. To
inform the police'tnust, in the long run,
mean to inform the public This Is what
we particularly desire to avoid."
"And why, sir?"
111 1 was then in a year, and even in a
decade, that shall be nameless, that upon
one Tuesday morning in autumn we
found two visitors of European fame
within the walls of cur humble room on
Baker street. The one, austere, high
rosed, eagle-eyed and dominant, was none
other than the. illustrious Lord Bellinger,
twice Premier of Britain. The- other,
dark," clear-cut and elegant, hardly yet
of middle age, and endowed with every
beauty of body and of mind, was the
Right Hon. Trelawney Hope, Secretary
for European Affairs, and the most
rising statesman in the country. They
tat side jby side upon our paper-littered
settee, -and it was easy to see from tbejr
worn and anxious faces that it was busi
ness of the most pressing Importance
which had brought them. The Premier's
thin, blue-veined hands were clasped
lightly over the ivory of his um
brella, and his gaunt, ascetic face looked
gloomily from Holmes to me. The Euro
pean Secretary- pulled nervou6ly at his
mustache and fidgeted with" the seals of
his watch chain. ' :
I HAD intended "The Adventure of
the Abbey Grange" to be 'the last of
those exploits of my frieud, Sherlock
Holmes, which 1 should ,ever com
municate to the public. This resolu
tion cf mine was not due lo any lack of
material, since 1 have notes of many hun
dreds of esses to which 1 have never al-
Juded^ nor was it caused L>y any waning
interest en the part of my readers in the
singular personality and unique methods
of this remarkable man. 'me real reason
lay in the reluctance which . r. Holmes
lias 6howri to the continued publication of
his experiences. So long as he was In
actual profcEdonal practice he records
ct Ills successes were of some practical
value to him, but since he has dettnitely
retired from London and befaken himself
to study and bee- farming on the Sussex
Downs, notoriety has become hateful to
him and? he has peremptorily requested
that his wishes in this matter should be
strictly observed. It was only upon my
representing to him that I had given a
promise that "The- Adventure of the Sec
ond Stain" should be published when the
times were ripe, and pointing out to him
that it is only appropriate that this long
series of episodes should culminate In the
most Important international case which
he has ever been called upon to handle,
tnat I at last succeeded in obtaining his
consent that', a carefully guarded account
cf the incident should at last be laid be
fore the public If in telling the story I
6eem to be somewhat vague in certain
details the public will readily understand
jj that there is an excellent reason for my
reticence.

All that day and the next and the next
Holmes was In a mood which his friends
would ct\W taciturn, and others morose.
He ran out and ran in, emoked Inces
santly, played snatches on his . violin,
tank into reveries, devoured sandwiches
at Irregular hours, and hardly answered
the casual Questions which I put to him.
It was evident to me that things were
not going well with him or his quest.
He would say nothing of the case, and
it was from the papers that I learned
the particulars of the inquest, and the ;
arrest with the subsequent release of
John Mltton, the .' valet -of the deceased.
The Coroners- Jury brought; in the ob
vious "willful murder," but' the parties
remained as unknown as ever. No motive
was eruggested. The room was full of
articles of value, but none had been
taken. The dead man's papers had not
been tampered with. They were care
fully examined, and showed that he. was
a keen student of international politics.
an Indefatigable gossip, a remarkable lin
guist, and an, untiring letter writer. 'He
had been on Intimate terms with tho
leading politicians of several countries.
But nothing sensational was discovered
among the documents which filled /his
drawers. As to his relations with women,
they appeared to have been promiscuous
but superficial. He had many acquaint
ances among them, but few friends, and
no one whom he loved. His habits wera
regular, his conduct inoffensive. [ His
death was an absolute mystery, and'
likely to remain so.
As to the arrest of John Mltton. the
vaiet, it was a council of despair as an
alternative to absolute Inaction.' -. But no
case . could be sustained against , him. . He
bad visited friends in Hammersmith that :
night. The alibi was complete. It Is
true that he started home at an hour
which should have, brought him to West
minster before - the : time when the crime
was discovered, but bis own explanation
that he .had walked part of the way
seemed probable enough in. view of the
fineness of the night. He had actually
arrived at 12 o'clock and appeared, to
be overwhelmed by "the ' unexpected
.tragedy. He had always been on:' good
terms with his master. Several of. the
dead man's possessionsâ^-notably &
small case of razors â had been found
In the valet's boxes, but he explaine-1
that they had been presents from the
deceased, and the housekeeper waa
able to corroborate the story. Mltton
had been In Lucas* emplo yment for
three years. â¢ It -was noticeable that
Lucas did. not like Mltton on the conti
nent with him. Sometimes he visited
Paris for three months on end. but
Mitton was left in charge of the Go
dolphin street house. As to the house
keeper, she had heard nothing on-.the
night of the crime. If her master, ha.d
a visitor he had himself admitted him.
So for three mornings the mys^oty
remained, so far as I could follow it in
the papers. If , Holmes knew more hÂ«
kept bis own counsel, but, as he told
me that Inspector Lestrade" had . taken
him into, his confidence in the case." I
knÂ«w that he was. in close touch with
every* development , Upon the- fourth
day there â¢ appeared a long, telegram;
from Paris wfaich'seemed to solve' the
whole question. â¢ \u25a0 \u25a0 .. / '. r .
**A . discovery, had Just been ma.de by
the Parisian police," said the Daily. Tel-_
egraph. "which raises the >ellH which;
hung round the tragic fate of Mr/lÂ£du-.
ardo Lucas, -who met his death jy vio
lence last Monday* night at Godolpb-.n
street. Westminster. Our readers will
remember that the' deceased gen :!eman
was found stabbed in his room.' and
that some suspicion attached to . his
valet, but that the case broke down on
an alibi. Yesterday . a . lady.- who has
been known as lime. Henri " Fournays,
occupying a small villa In the Rue'-Aus
terlitz, was reported to the authorities
by her servants as bÂ«ing Insane An
examination" showed .she had i indeed
developed mania" of a dangerous aril
permanent form." On inquiry, the po-(
lice have discovered that' Mme.- Henri
Fournaye only returned from 1 - a jour
ney to London on - Tuesday last, \u25a0 sn4
there is evidence to connect herewith
the prime at Westminster. . A compar
ison%3f photographs has proved conclu
sively that M. Henri Fournaye and KU
uardo Lucas were really one and ; the
same person, and - that the \u25a0 deceased
had for some reason lived a doublallfe
In London and Paris. Mme. Fournaye,
-who is of Creole". origin, is- of. an ex
tremely excitable nature and - has â¢ suf
fered In the past from of ; Jeal-^
ousy which have amounted to â¢ f reil tot.
It Is conjectured: that It was in one o!
these that she committed the terrible
crime which has caused such Â£/ sensa
tion in London." Her movements upon
the Monday, night have not yet been
traced, but It 'is undoubted that; a wo
man answering to her description at
tracted much attention at Charing
Cross Station on. Tuesday morn 'jus W
the wildness of her appearance an.l the
violence of her gestures. It is proba
ble, therefore, that the crime was either
committed when' Insane or that i'-S Im
mediate effect was to drive the unhap
py woman out of her mind. At present
shs is unable to give any coherent ac
count of the past, and the doctors bold
out no hopes of the re-estibllshmunt
of her season There Is evidence that
a wercan. who might have be jn Mine.

THE townfolk called her Funeral
EaL "Poor woman, she does not
deserve her misfortune." the
cognizant of the true story of
her life and the sympathic mut
tered; while others saw in her a comedy
as she roamed about in her fantastic
regalia regardless of taste and weird
as a masquerader. No thought to her
welfare, perhaps, was spared by the
numbers â for she was crazy. .
Countless were the colors In her
wardrobe, which was all donned a mcme
tempore cine exception, in the ardency
of obtaining effect tor the special oc
casions. In skirts ankle length, seven
in number and seven core each, gradu
ated respectively from the under lull
nesses and shaded from a cream to a
certee, the various shades were in evi
dence. In shirt waist of a correspond-
ing fullness, belted in at the waist with
an emerald green sash and creation
pour la tete with one black quill pro
jecting vertically from the crown and
wreathed with sundries, suggestive of
spring and presenting a revival and
combination of fashions, the rigure
completely described the color card.
Walking slowly, she observed, shyly as
maiden can, the moving imagqf ln the
enow windows and her expression tola
the satisfaction that a society belle
feels, but shows not, as she steps into
the palatial salon, conscious of being
faultlessly gowned, observed and ad
mired by aIL - . -
"A hundred to one, there's a funeral
on the programme for to-day, for
there's Funeral Sal,** ejaculated v. wise
young 'leisurely' full of the spirit of
his joke as he had capacity for the
llqyid foam. "Wonder where her
'Troubles* is 7" he continued for tha ex
press information to a refined looking
gentle stranger who was casting an in
quiring, and curious glance at the
\u25a0
strangely attired woman.
"She** got no "Troubles* now," punned
his typical companion. v.no ha- j-ust
made his exit from the corner wiloon;
"but she "II hunt urn."
The person alluded to in the conver
sation was a John Trublef, whom the
wits nicknamed "Troubles" because of
his habit of including - his grievances
in each and every conversation. Him
poor Sal pitied.
The curiosity of the stranger was
suddenly aroused. .'"Who is that poor
woman, her name?" he inquired of the
Informer. -'That's Funeral Sal." Came
the reply with indicative inflection.
"Do you know her own name?" he
again inquired, yet more anxiously,
with a look of disgust at the continu
ous heartless reoly. - - "
"That's her own and all sjvc does
own besides 'the coop she flpw' da
'Piety Hill' to hunt Troubles* at the
county hostelry." *
Withal, as he caugiit a nearer glance
of the dim, sad eye. he read in it the
traces of a life of care and sorrow.
Again ho lent liis car to eaten the,
muffled words she' repeated as ' she
stood c&zlag into space: then came in
beautiful and touching notes '-'Nearer.
My God, to Thee." Hor voice had lost
little of Â»its virgin sweetness and
brought lo memory the figure of a
beautiful maiden in the church choir
whose poft notes moved the stony
hearts and made more convert* than
preaching' of the " doctrine of that
church. The same .notes had prompted
bis youthful life to noble aspirations.
the notes that filled his heart with the
infinite power of a mother's love and
bade him repent and show her the af
fections of a lovins son. Out of this
revery he was startled by the rough
voice of the patron of vice. "So funer
al's a success without Sal; she's a first
class mourner. I'm . tellin' yu. . She'll
tell yu the history of every man, wom
an or kid of this generation, frpm crib
to dump. She's got more of the good
book in her nut, if- it is rattled, than a.
dozen Ministers, but eqc never misses
& session." \u25a0 '
"Ssre," interrupted the interested but
unsteady partner, approaching the two
and pointing to the funeral notice oh"
the telegraph post back of Mr. Benson.
"It's AL Falls {co nicknamed, owing
to his Inability to fulfill the require
ments cf his position as the fatat dis
ease was gapping his strength)
w-what's passed in his checks, and
they's just got done bottlln' him,- and
Sal's f-full cf 8-pEalnw.", ,
Memory assisting, the sympathetic
gentleman asked: "Isn't v her husband
J&rnee Stanton?"
"I dunno If she ever had a busbar.-?,"
responded the now swaying figure,
while the other simultaneously and
emphatically corrected: < "It- was -Jim
Stanton."
This left bo doubt in Mr. Benson's
mind as to the Identity of the unfortu
nate woman, as he left the^ Information
bureau and was lost In the crowdi
Jamis Stanton had wooed the fair
Grac* Seltori, lured her from home and
friends only to ruin" her life through
his debauchery and finally, showed mer
py, comparatively. . in. committing her
to the Insane asylum and her two little
children to the orphanage. Meanwhile
Fate passed judgment, for he was kill
ed In a fray by one of his own class.
Her prayers were answered when
her little ones were restored to her
arms and the charitable of. the com
munity built for them a cabin in which
the Uttle family lived, and Mrs. Stan
tot? supported It by taking in 'washing.
John and James were shortly after
etricken â¢with . diphtheria- and left the
mother cf a lonely wreck upon the sea of
humanity. The report of Mrs. Stanton's
death was co.Tflktink with the eight

Â«he'Â« crazy, they say. .Butane ain't
crazy."
â¢""We will soon take her out, Johnnie.
and reward her for being so kind to
you."
"But won't she be happy!" The pale
face again lit up with Joy as the true
Christian soul was seeing a way clear in
helping others, and i everything looked
.bright. to him once more.
! llrs. Benson meanwhile was busy pre
paring the frugal.' meal, but pride,
pi-bmpted again by. the strong heart, she
said, as Mr. Benson appeared" in the
kitchen: "We have scarcely anything in
the house to eat since Johnnie has beea
unable to do the shopping. I'll leave you
to keep house till I get back."
She felt the awful pain of destitution,
but must hide it for her husband;* sake.
There was only one means to raise money
-to pawn her wedding She would
make this sacrifice. Uncle John must
not know all, she thought. Mr. Benson
felt deeper and deeper the effect of thÂ«
words he deemed a brother's duty to ex
press. "Jennie, let me take Joninie's
place in doing the errands." he said. "To
comfort and help my brother's children
is all "the hope there remains in lUe for
me and permit me, "at least, my doty. I
have, hoped to spend the remainder of
my bachelorhood with you. Believing

identity, the complete : change la her ap

I could see no traces, of resemblance, to
the -orice beautiful girl I beheld in the

down her pale cheeks. .; s -.The anxious

If he wlaned anything, she leaned if orward
and kissed him. "1 will return in a few
minutes," said Mr. Benson as he opened
the door and was -taking' hia best eppor
t'inity to do - the act of. tove. '.'Hurry,

strength in thÂ« lesponslbillty of /the be

from" his own refinement planned .'the deli

'life to the table "of the poor. The littla
invalid showed such improvement that
the mother, encouraged - and hopeful, in
turn, produced the marked effect, upon his
spirits. .Johnnies. expressed wish that the
dining table be set by bis bedside waa
being fulflllea when Mr. Benson. returned
with the provisions. Jennie's- eyes grew
large as the full-blown bluebell and be^
gun to show inclinations toward congeni

the dinner while Uncle John interested
\u25a0 the eager listeners with bright stories.
'A different spirit hovered over the sor
row-burdened family as they' sat down
to partake 'of the plain but plenteous
, feast while JtJnnhle was being' served
first. "God has sent you to us to cheer
us. Uncle John! 1 wish poor Sal would
come - now, wouldn't she ... enjoy this?"
'"We w^li invita her when she comes,
Johnnie." said Mr. Benson, sanctioning
the open-hearted invitation to his help
mate. A little later was heard a knock at .
-the door and Johnnies prayers were an
swered, for there stood Sal. -
The happy expression on the drawn,
sallow face- came like the morning sun
light Into thÂ« sickroom and j" told her
extreme ; joy. at the sudden" and fortu

delight; while the unanimous and cor

to John's bedside and placed "In the

ple ;h'ave had" pain. -fe until -they,, have
-come 'to* look iupon It as part of )the
general scheme , of things. It Is hard
to make them realize that It need not
be. Uncinariasia was only another af
fliction that Dioa had heaped on the
Portoriquenos and they were . used . to
it. .Besides Americanos make so many
promises that they, never fulfill.
But at last ten men were found will- '
Ing to trust **el doctor", to .- the. bitter
end. Accordingly a second examina
tion'was made. to test tha actual pres
ence of the germs, and arrangements
made for giving the treatment in. the
dispensary, -of 'the Telegraph: Hill
Neighborhood House. . - .
On the Bth of March the " first
bluemass capsule and dose of salts was
given. It sounds simple. But to get
those ten men ' together at the same
time was a work of art.' Tropical ideas
of punctuality are peculiar. As for the
capsules they went down as capsules
always do. But the salts: **Por amor
dlDios.es saltlguiara/* cried one Jet
black negro as if he had been offered
poison. . : One . man took his hat ' when
he saw It coming and heard he could
! eat nothing that night; and went calm
ly out. determined to fret his dinner
before, since he could not have any
afterward. .
. When all. had .been impart! ally dosed
they were sent home." with strict ' In
junctions to.be back at 8 the next
' morning: for the real treatment. Just
six turned up. The other four had sam
pled the first stagehand no power on.
- earth - could persuads them to try the
second. In vain It was explained that
the bluemass and saltigulera. episode
was a thing of the past. They took to
their beds, tied up their heads in true
Latin fashion and refused to budge.
Before the day was over the six
heroes on -the dispensary Coo r wished
that they, too, were safe In bed. Every
fifteen minutes of the first hour they
were given one-eighth of a grain of
"calomel and every hour twenty grains
of thymol, until they had taken eighty.
By the time the third dose was down
they were firmly' convinced that this
was the meanest trick the Americanos
had played on them yet. Half of them
wanted to -leave and would have, done
so only they were too dizzy ' to walk.
An hour after the last dose of 'thymol
the hated saltiguiera again appeared.
Thl3 time there were no remarks. The
needed energy had vanished.
With the last - ounce of salts the
treatment ended.: A few hours later
these men who for years had not known
what it ; was to be - free of pain went
home cured. " For the * next * few day 3
milk and eggs were sent from the
Fruit and Flower Mission, for strength
cannot be '-\u25a0 bunt up on ' fried potatoes
and beans, and the people are too poor
to buy anything else. .
Two weeks later a second examlna-
tlon was made to be sura that all the
" germs . had disappeared. ..In a few '
cases there were still some traces, so
another treatment was given. There
was no about this, however.
The men had proved for themselves the
powers of the .wizard* "doctor** and they
would " have willingly * have taken â¢. a
dozen' lf he" had told* them to. ':OneÂ»
man almost insisted on a second treat
ment, just to make sure. - '<^KBHQH|i
,: Another -promised his wife that If
she would only take It hs would go
through with it a second time for com
pany's sake. But she had heard of the
awful saltlgulera test and her courage
failed.*? She wasted to. She wanted to
- badly, butââ At last the husband took
the authority: Into . his own . hands and
asked < the nurse to bring the medicine
to , the house. The \u25a0 capsule was laid
; r eady, '- M the salts mixed. The T woman
': took one . look and - fled. "Santa Maria,

as he seized the capsule and washed it
down" with the salts. The precious
medicine that had helped to make him
.well was not to be 'wasted. If ihe would
.'-not. >he must.: .

Just because your hands are small

How to Have Pretty Hands
sleeves either long or reaching only to
the elbow, tight over the bust, and hang
ing ctralght down with apparently |no
waist line. I say apparently,' there really
Is no waist line, but the dress must be
cut to form a graceful slcpe from the
bust to the floor. In some cases this is
effected by having a boneless | lining flrr
ting the figure closely, while the outer
dress may bang quite loosely. Frequent-
Jy there is a tight lining bodice * and
sometimes two underskirts. While there
are many different kinds of tea-gowns,
the. style that seems to me to bo the
most effective is what Is called the
Empire gown. In this gown the lines
are extremely graceful, flowing and easy."
A type of this kind is shown in the
illustration of the . triple gown, \
which- appears to be so v flowing
and simple^jvhile In reality it is a very
elaborate one,' although It is ' made for
comfort as' well, as beauty. It Is really
three gowns, the first, of which, or the
under gown, is of blue Liberty sajin, and v
is made to fit well across the bust, \u25a0 but :
is loosed although with a Blight curve aY
the waist. , this is , an '. accordion
plaited gown/ofi blue Liberty silk, down
the back of which three strips of silver .
lace Insertion are Â«ewed on and reach
to the bottom .. of the skirt. The strips
of insertion begin one at each shoulder
and one in the middle of the back, coming
nearly togethej at, the waist; line,' arid di
verging â¢ thence, tht.^ flare out to the
bottom of the gown. The same effect is
carried out in the front of the ! dress,:
but only two strips of insertion are used
there. Over all of this is an outer dress
of cream (of perhaps it may i be called.;
ecru) colored net lace. . In the illustra-f .
tion this outer dress opens in front and;
hangs loosely from the; bust, ' giving a
very graceful effect. The , whole . coin-*.
bination, with the "\u25a0 faint motif - t "of silver,
ia wonderfully attractive. .. The. ; sleeves l
are made of thY lace, with .a'little!chif
fon puff at , the ; top, on which , are three
dainty blue satin bows, . but" they are left \u25a0

real tea-gown, which may be simple or
elaborate, but must be cozy, comfortable
and gracefulâ something to rest the eye,
and consequently a rest jto the tired
brain. Of course, the gown should be
Â«omething more than merely easy and
graceful, it must be ' well made, harmo
nious and appropriate, and of superior
material. Such a gown is, no doubt, a
luxury,* but I think we are entitled to
some luxuries, and thls # particular ex
travagance gives pleasure, not only to
ourselves, but to our friends as well.
And after all it need not be such a very
expensive affair. It can be simply made,
and graceful lines cost no more than
stiff and straleht lines. In' France, the
tea-gpwn Is much more - generally worn
than it is here. Both the. material and
the cost of making are much less than
here. '\u25a0 But after all the . main ' thing is
the design, which sometimes calls forth
the greatest efforts of the most celebrated
makers, or sometimes is the product of
the individual skili and' taste of the
wearer. In France a young lady's trous
seau "will always contain several -tea
gowns, some of which, are simple,, while
some are more or ' less elaborate. "â¢ The
latter can frequently be worn ' at ..' dinner
and in; the . evening, unless - there; are .; in
vited /guests. J Tea-gowns aire ; usually
made somewhat Â»low In the -neck, the
Â£""F^HE term "tea-gown" is alluringly
1 suggestive, including, as it docs,
I not only the garb, but all the sur-
I roundir.Ers and concomitants that
serve to give it its particular charm.
One can easily bring to mind a picture of
n. cozy parlor, a bright flre, a dainty
eUver tea-set on a silver tray, a cup of
Celiciously flavored tea, a charming
hostess and an informal chat, with a dash
of gosdp. Or perhaps one can fancy
substantially the same surroundings on
a cool, shady veranda on a warm sum
mer day in the country. The hostess, if
attired In the proper tea-gown, will ap
pear bo comfortable," so much at ' her
ease and co attractive withal that con
versation can never flag, nor spirits
droop. Such situations with such sur
roundings cannot but be delightful, and
it Is somewhat of a i^ty. it seems to me.
that afternoon tea is not more univer
sally Indulged in. in an entirely informal
way. It is restful, refreshing and most
agreeable. But it is not nearly so com
mon with us as it is in England, where
It is generally a regular thing. Possibly
the custom will gradually grow here,
which is greatly to be desired.

; A French tea gown, the charm of which"
seems to lie in its simplicity in line and
color, is made of satin and lace. .The outer
material ' is Liberty satin of a Nile green
color, and the lining Is a soft India silk.
It is brought tight across the bust and
drawn up on ' the left side, where it is
fastened â¢ with an elaborate buckle. The
sleeves are unmistakably French,' of a
kind which is rarely seen here, but' which
is very popular in France. The top of the
sleeve is a chiffon puff of the same color
as the, gown, , while the sleeves them
selves,, which are made of. heavy, white
lace and jeweled with imitation emeralds
and 'pearls, fit the arm very snugly and
are brought flown m a point over tha
hand. The neck mis cut square and Is
finished \u25a0with the same jeweled . lace.
Altogether, the effect of thi3 gown is
exceedingly pretty. - I '
A charmingly pictpuresque gown la that
that was made at the famous estab
lishmentâ"Liberty's." Liberty's, J that
wonderfully fascinating place," full
and of. the most alluring styles,
has dual headquarters* one in Bond
or Regent street. London, and one
on 'the avenue de I' Opera. In Paris. This
particular gown came from the Paris
.establishment. It Is made of that won
derfully soft, , white. ; material .which la
called Liberty satin, so soft and thin
that the color of the under-gown or lin
ing can be seen through it. 1 This lining
is of pink Liberty silk, and a' most
charming effect' is produced by the pink
glimmer showing through the soft white
ea tin. The gown i 3 made . in the.. Empire
style, fitting quite snugly across the bust,
where it > ls embroidered with pearls.
From the back of the . gown a fold of
white chiffon is brought under the arms
and tied in a knot on one side at the
edge of the square cut low neck line,
and the long ends hang down almost to
the - floor. The edges of these ends are
outlined in pearls, and pearl tassels hang
from the bottom of them. The sleeves
are ' wide' and full, and arÂ» made Ilka
butterfly's wings, banging to the floor in
a point. The material is whits chiffon,
with a puff at the top. and , they, give
a most charming effect to thi3 very
beautiful gown. The sleeves ara open
down , the middle of tha arm and are
caught together with Ilttla satin buttons.
Like the chiffon ends, tha sleeves ara
outlined with pearls and have a tassel
at each end. This apparently slrnpl* but
really elaborate tea-gown la a particu
larly fascinating one and serves excel
lently well to end tha list. I trust, how
ever, that I have said enough "to prova
that the tea-gown, whll* it Is a moat at
tractive and interesting garment, must
be undertaken with the greatest tasta
and must be watched and guarded with
the greatest care. It is an unusually dell,
cate dress, easily rumpled, and easily
soiled, and It should never be allowed to
be either.

It Is a fortunate thing that California
did not kill oft the heavy-weight con

cream of the sport would be driven. to
the secret places and that would be bad
for all hands. The public takes more
stock in one battle by us biff fellows
than they do In fifty fights â¢by lighter,
fellows, no 'matter how clever the .lat
ter may be. and I can't see why there
i 3 this cranky desire to kill oft the
sport by barring the biff fellows from
doing the things nature built them to
do. Frames like mine were never In
tended for â¢ ribbon counters and such.

But just ; as we were about' to'start
the hall .agoing, in came a'flock"qf;pb^
lice and they declared 'the whole: thing*
I made the promise -and stuck to It.
The- training was as stiff as Patsey could
make it, and there, wasn't any drinking
In It at all. When the time came' for/the
battl-s in Philadelphia * I was as fit as a
fiddle and Dominick McCaffrey might
well have felt a little weak around the
knees at, the prospect .that was before
him. But to give him credit, I think he
was as eager for battle as I wasâ and I
was â¢ simply crazy to get 1 him within * a
comfortable ring and - before -as - large a
crowd as he had when he made his orig
inal defl. / -;. i
The night " the battle was scheduled ; for 1
there was a mob of i sports v gathered ; in

"I'll train you upon one condition," said
Patsey. "and that is that you'll do ab
solutely what I tell you as regards eating
and drinking, especially drinking." \u25a0
Well, after the failure to meet Kllrain,
McCaffrey fcught Pete McCoy in the old
Windsor Theater in . Boston. 2 The bout
wasn't a decision, and I was fn McCoy's
corner and told Dominick what I thought
of him. He declared that he could not
only wallop McCoy, who ' was ' a breezy
and cheerful fighter, but he could lick me.
He added some thingsâ words which, all
the world over, mean fight.
He Goes Alter Dominick McCaffrey.
m At that time, only the boldest kind of
men used . the kind of language on me
that McCaffrey did, and as he made his
boasts before quite a crowd of folks, I
made up my mind to make him eat his
words.
A match was made -. and we were to
meet in Philadelphia. I went to Patsey
Shepherd of Boston and told him I want
ed him to train mo for the work on thÂ»
hide of the bold and boastful Dominick.
I want every negro to do well and my

One .of the hardest turns at training!
ever did was for a fight that never came
off. I got ready to make a demonstra
tion on the make-up of Dominlck Mcr
Caffrey. and I never made It It is quite
a story. To begin with. McCaffrey was
matched to fight Jake Kilrain before the
swell Cribb Club of Boston. Kilrain ap
peared to carry out his part of the con
tract, tut for some reason McCaffrey did
not show up. The head man of the Cribb
Clubâ a Mr. Appollonio, I think it wasâ
announced to the members of the club
that never would McCaffrey be allowed
Inside the doors of the place because of
his faijure to come to' the scratch. 1
To those who never heard of this Cribb
Club of Boston, I may say that It was
made up of the blue bloods and kid glove
element of Boston. Only members were
allowed to attend Its affairs, one black
ball could bar any candidate for member
ship, and only men whose people,' came
over in the first cabin of the .Mayflower
need apply. The fighters, of course, whose
folks came over In the Cephalonia, were
hired for their occasions. There was an
other Cribb Club in Boston later on, but
that was a different kind of club, and
anybody could get . Into its affairs if he
had the srice at the door.
Have you noticed that Marvin Haft's
victory over the colored brother has
fallen very flafc^ It surely has. It's
only what might have been looked for.
A white man has nothing to gain by
swapping punches with a negro. I have
twice been almost goaded Into .meeting
the colored brother, byt I took a second
think In time. A club in San Francisco
hung- up a fortune for me to meet Peter
Jackson â there waa $20,000 . in It, and
nobody ever questioned my ability to
win It â but I ducked. I was insulted
from one end of the country! to the
other In the attempt to stampede me
Into that fiftht, and I was angry enough
at one time to throw principle to the
\u25a0winds and give Jackson his. Another
time I almost came to a set-to with
George Godfrey, but I am glad to say
I didn't '
When I goAjut to battle with a man I
agree that he is of equal standing. A
negro is not the equal of a white man
and it is no kindness to the negro to let
him think so. Fights between negroes
are all right, but the line should be drawn
there. Hart has gained nothing by meet-
Ing a negro, and if he had lost to the
colored brother It would have been his
finish. I am willing to admit that Hart
had a great deal of provocation, but he
never had as much as I had to meet
Jackson.

An official of tho street railway com

worse than -a house aflre " for playing
horse with their business and If I'd move
away and never come back , to Boston,
he'd pay raylfaro as far as' l'd go. But
I wasn't to blame -because the streets
were too narrow. Soon after this when
a horse car got ou the track on Washing
ton street and six of eight men had tried
to lift it back on the iron. I lifted it on
alone, I sent word to the street railway
official that what he needed at the head
of his outfit to keep his arks -going all

Tug happened to think of some business
he had to transact In dear old Eng

Tuff lived happy ever after on the coin

wasn't any suspicion that I didn't do

York, kept falling to the .floor before
he was hit and used up most of the
four rounds in that way. I did hit him
once and he went down, all right. But
he was up inside of ten seconds, as
counted by the referee, Harry Hill, but

down end out. He was in Just the shape
I expected to find him about this time.
He EDckft to me and when I placed him I
told him to get away quick. It was this
man who cent a proposition to me to "lay
down" In one of my fights, and the price*
was three times what the winner's end
of the purse would be. This proposition
wasn't made to me direct, but came
through a friend of mine who had been
Induced to think he was doing me a good
turn by carrying the message.
"When I Jumped on the scheme the rob
bers behind it tried to explain that they
were only taking measures to bÂ« sure
that the money they were going to put
ca me would be safe. But I was on. That
wasn't the only time the cards were
stacked to beat the public, but it never
was done In any fight I was in. Before
my meeting with Ryan. Joe Goss. who
was one of my seconds, was offered H5OO
In cold cash â not stage money or prom
lees â to drug me just enough so that I
couldn't wlu. Joe Goss, who. was as hon
est a man as ever stepped, and who loved
me as his own brother, was fit to do mur
der when the bribe was put to him. Joe
didn't do any too much praying and he
didn't do any hymn singing, but he could
chew a lot of good people how to live on
the square and die without fear when his
time came. Although the first fight of
any account In my career was my defeat
of Joe. who had been champion, he never
had o-e minute's hard feeling for me, but
was my admirer, friend and helper dur
ing his Ufe.
Tur Wilson's Quick Touch and Getaway.
The down-and-out sport I started
telling about was in his day as high a
roller as'you'd find. He made a lot of
money on "fixed" events of all kinds
and he made boasts that he was out to
win money, not to lose it. He always
played with loaded dice and he was
one of the men who introduced the
plan, now so much in use, of having
boxers fight to trim the outsiders. In
the good old days there was none of
this, and while fighters did not adver
tise themselves as "gentlemen boxers,"
they did fight on the square.
Taink over the "fights" of the past
f*w years and see how many of them
have been "fixed." Enough money has
been picked out of pockets by this kind
of fighting to pay for the .Panama ca

either. One month yon might make a
fair living and go hungry the next, for
there .; are not enough positions , nor

flnestion, bat as it la I should advise
: you to give up the idea entirely.
ONE o* the chief worries that bobs
up serenely to confront the house
holder year after year and with
renewed force is the proper cover
ing and papering of walls.
Certainly wall papers are a necessity,
but th*y are also a nuisance and it. is
only after a deal of experience and
annoyance that you are able to select
one with any decree of comfort and
eecming intelligence. Of course, if you
care nothing' whatsoever about choos
ing: furnishings so that they may dis
play a bit of individuality, it is simple
enough to hire some one to furnish or
refurnish your house, as the case may
be, but if you are half way interested
you will in all probability think that
there is nothing more difficult under
the shining sun than to select paper
as roll after roll is unfurled and held
up for your inspection- .
The lirst and primary thing to de
cide is the color scheme. .That once
out of the way the rest should be com
paratively easy. The size of the room
and its use is the next thing to worry
over, Xor .the figure must depend en
tirely on the amount of space to be
covered. For instance, a small room .
would look about like a closet if a
big design were plastered over its sides,
and a room of large dimensions would
apparently increase in size if the figures
were wee or even of a self-toned effect.
The third and all-important question
to consider is the furnishings of the
room itself. The pictures that are to
be hung are either made or marred
by the wall, so it Is quite necessary
to remember that water colors and
etchings show up much better in ,a
. plain covering and oils on a small de*
eign, and to remember, too, that the
color of frames often makes a marked
difference in the tone of the room.
If you are ever in doubt play trumps; '
' as it -were, and then only burden your
mind with the one thought that trumps
in furnishing: means but one thing:
plain, solid styles and exceedingly
simple withal. In the majority of cases
this is' the best idea, to follow out, for
the result is nuarly always satisfactory.
In fact, could it very well be otherwise?
It is something like a tailor-made
frock. Its very plainness obviates all
possibility of displaying bad. taste.
But remember that while the ingrain -
paper will keep out an immense amount
of bad decoration, it in itself is not any
more a decoration than is a, plain cal
cimlned^wall.: ,It is immensely useful
and can very easily be made exceeding
ly pretty by merely adding an ingrain
frelze. which, by the way, has ' been
fashioned' for the very purpose of add
ing a decorative quality Â»to the some
times too &lain wall.
While plain walls are always pretty
and soothing- and useful, they aro not i'
always the fad of the hour, though
there 1b no get tine away from the fact
that they never go out as forcibly and
as quickly as elaborate designs done! in
striking effects with the figures in bold
relief. But be that; as 'it -may,'' the 'fact'
remains that just at present, all sorts
of contrasting shades and "all condi
tions of quaint hangings are ; not only.,
/feels? used but axe the fad of the hour.

And I have the hardihood to differ

"I was .: educated at

to .me how little there Is in

about, "and I did not go

Dorotbea Kern Jewett, B.
A-, \u2666 and "most distin
guished graduate of the
year." typifies the uniyer- -
city's ideal , of * the \u25a0 co-ed,
what Is 'Dorothea Kern
Jewett like?
If I had a sister or a
daughter yearning . for a'
university education I
should want to know. If 'l*
were a school girl getting
my lessons with an eye to
the university I . ehould
want to know, - If I were
an undergraduate, at the
mercy of the winds that
blow good and 111 in the
college world, I should
very much : want tp know.
The most surprising,
thing about . Dorothea.
â¢Kern Jewett is that she is
net in the least "new.". 1
had to- rub -my eyes and
look again to make sure. l
was seeing - aright,' for
from . the very first mo
ment when she opened the
door to" me she seemed the'
very" oldest type of wom
ankindâthe jj type that < has
been treasured through all
the ages' of â¢ historyâ the
entirely.^ sweetly' feminine '
type, simple,^ domestic, un
affected, ' the "\u25a0') genuine
"home" girL ..
/But when she speaks with that sweet
\u25a0rraTity of hers you â¢ know it wouldn't

They weigh and measure the signifi
cance of . their acts.
So in making the award of this high
honor to Dorothea Kern Jewett there
was definite purpose and Intention.
The conferring or such an honor is
not for stirring -the gratification of the
one and the envy, of the 495.
It in primarily to set a standard, to
hold up an Ideal.
Therefore Dorothea Kern Jewett,
singled out of the class of 500, mostly
men, justifies co^uJucation and the
higher education for women, and at the
Â«ame time typifies-the university's ideal
of the woman- student.
"Here," say, the president and fac
ulty, setting this ".-.modest, unassuming,
fair young girl of fine mind, and pa
tient industry "upon the pedestal, "here
is -the type of woman student we de
sire, we approve, we honor."
In consequence Dorothea Kern Jew
ett, B. A., Is the most interesting young
woman in California to-day to those
interested in college education.
Just when everything seemed all
settled .and secure for .co-education,
the arguments for and against it broke
out again, and are raging with inter
mittent virulence across the country
and the seas. In editorial columns, In
magazines and women's club papers;
yes, and in the internal counsels of
Â»me" of our great universities.
Stanford University, within our own
borders, has limited the participation
of the co-ed !n its advantages to a
poor 500. ' r . . . \ \ . \
At tie Chicago University the men
and the women students are being
herded separately with the.warcry
of "segregation." ~
So the University of California, which
has ever extended a cordial \u25a0 hand to
women and which has indeed given
this honor to its women students sev
eral times before, again emphasizes its
hospitality by . conferring It 3 highest
honor upon a woman student." and in
the pers#n and cualifications and
achievements ot this fair young girl
"holds up its Ideal of the woman stu
dent.
She is, a? It wÂ»re, the refutation of
all protests against higher education
for women, {the answer to all argu
ments against co-education. And in
this lirht her every trait and charac
teristic and quality are interesting. If
WHERE University avenue
straggles off into the country.
Kfter the easy, amiable fashion
of Berkeley thoroughfares, I
ring- the bÂ«!l cf a pleasant, modest
brovrn house, and the door is opened to
rue by "the most distinguished graduate
of the year"* herself.
I am prepared. I t"hink, for anything â
for the severe superiority of such tre
:nendous learning as must be necessary
to win the medal for distinguished
scholarship over five hundred students,
mostly men, all straggling for distinc
tion, for the aplomb of .'â¢conscious
power" that goes with so much
acknowledged 6tudent excellence, for
the condescension cf . the newly
pl edged B. A., for any or all of those
darling characteristics of -the -college
graduate that the world so gently toler
ates the while it sandpapers them away.
Z have found them all before as un
failingly repeated as the* grass of the
springtime â the severity, the superior
ity, the Â»plomb, the condescension, the
absence of tree proportion â and 1 have
loved them, for don't they belong to
the sweet illusions and buoyant en
thusiasms cf youth, from which the
harcest-hearted of us would not take
cne alsgle shining ray!
I do not anticipate a surprise, for life
tfter a time holds so few surprises.
Given certain combinations certain re
sults are to be expected, and I am pre
pared I Idly think.

Yes, she is the right Miss Jewett,

vras awarded the university medal for
distinguished scholarship.
"Butâ you are so young!" I protest,
and almost add aloud, "so ingciiuous,

She smiles with s-weet gravitr.

â¢â¢The medal was awarded to this stu
dent Because of her distinguished scholar
ship and her 'line Qualities of character,
for there can be no high; scholarship
without high moral qualities. She Is a,
young woman of -exceptionally high In
telligence. You can "see that m her
eyes. : In their \u0084' steadiness. Her high
standing In schclarshlp was not a matter
of rote. of. being letter perfect. Her
mtr?d goes beyond that in understanding:
she brings , thought -to . her- work. She
has the mental power' that gives poise.

THE GIRL WHO WINS.
HELEN DAREIT xe&M an exclusive party of eight.
Sir George Minturn and wife were
at the head of it. The. others were
Mrs. Woeburn, widow of the civil
engineer; the Hon. James Blackman.
wife and daughter; D'ArtKen. a
French 3Â»!arquis, and Brittman of the
German Embassy In London. They
\u25a0were all ultra-fashionable in their way.
and their little party had not been
made up entirely by. accident/ Sir
George and the Honorable James had
" planned a voyage to the Mediterranean
and had Invited Mrs. Woeburn as 'a
guest. The Marquis, who had met Miss
Blackman a few times in London so
ciety, decided that he was in love with
her, and determined to-take. the *trlu
on his own account, to further his In
terests. Brittman did not know whether
he was in love with the widow or not.
As he had secured leave of absence for
four month*. !t seemed to him that he
might as well make a voyage as re
main ashore.
But when the steamer reached Gib
raltar the "ring" suddenly found the
sand , being cut from ' under its ' feet, b y
the undertow. The "undertow" came
aboard at that point. He was" a . tall,
solid man, with a mer/y eye and an
open face and his manner was friend
ly. It was safe to say that he was not
the scion of aristocrats, "and that ' he
had neither a. college diploma nor a
knowledge of the rules of . social etl-'
quette. He had scarcely, stowed away
his things in a stateroom .when he
made a bold-faced attempt to break
down the "ring." Sir: Gebnre was Dac-
Ing the deck with his cigar 'when the
new arrival walked up to him and said:
"I*ll keep you company, if you don't
mind, captain. I've been waiting here
for a week , and I'm do^-tired \of \u25a0 old
Gib. Plenty of guns apd redcoats arid
all that, but do you know I couldn't
find a cocktail inthe whole, place? Pos
itive fact, sir. Never even heard' of one.
Think of a town without a cocktail!"
- Sir George halted. < Then he - slowly
tCopyrlglit "by the fi. S. McClure Co.)
raised his monocle and adjusted; it. He
Etared at the stranger for along half
minute before he exclaimed: '
. "Sir, are you addressing me ?"
f "By George, but ; you're a cool old
boy!" mused the . other in tones of ad
miration. "Standing on etiquette, eh?
Well,- maybe* I was- too previous. My
name's Joslynâ Colonel Joslyn of tDa-.
s kota, U/ S. A." I've got a sworn .'af
fidavit in 'my' trunk from our County
Sheriff that I've -never been arrested
for murder. You've" got a name;; I
suppose?"
"Sir!" gasped the Englishman, as he
continued to stare. v , ; "
"And I'm. making a little, pleasure
trip all by my lonesome,"- continued
the colonel. ' "Always .said f I wou J d '
if I ever got money .enough.-. Ho w7afe
you on . poker?. ' I haven't;.- played ' a
game In three months and'am'begin
ning to" feel homesick."
\u25a0 Sir George's hand went up- to \ : . his
glass. The \u25a0 glass - v/as , ; removed . from
his eye. Hand and glass fell together.
Then he faced about and walked off as
erect as a West Pointer. ' Colonel
JoElj'n had been snubbed. There were
five or six people looking on and' en-^
joying the affair â¢ arid they j expected Ito
hear some outburst on 1 the" colonel's
parL v ; There was", none/, however. \u25a0% He
merely rubbed' his -hands'- together arid
smiled'arid said'to'himself: : .
"The old cock is either a Jolly or
else he's ; standing, on . i his -".'dig * because
we don't rent pews In the same^church.

extended a" cigar in his , fingers. â¢ 4
The vMarquis smiled "faintly- and
shrugged t his (shoulders.^. â¢ He \ had ! seen

felt it a duty: to follow his example.

sent, down into the engine iroom to act
as a tonic on the assistant and his fire

tojact queerly.and he was hurried Into
the corner with the other prisoner and
Sir, George detailed, to guard them. The
Hon. . Blackman took his place before
the quarters of -the deck â¢ hands, and
then, by * Colonel. 'Joslyo's directions, tha
.rest of the armed men got such, cover "
.as i they could and opened fire on '> the
robbers, who were . skulking along the
bank. ; It was not prize target shooting,
but it drove the fellows back and less
ened their fire. It did not take fifteen
minutes " to fix the engines, and whan
they were: pronounced all right there
was 'steam enough ' in ' the boiler to go
; ahead with.", r
â¢But'they were notto get out of it.Â«o
easily. The r 'thieves" ashore saw how
things were progressing, and they md
denly - ceased their â¢ attack and ran to
a flat boat lying against the bank above
the village. A full score of them Jumped
in and \u25a0; cast off." If they reached thÂ«
steamer.-, they were-Btrons-enoushilto

calls for, the crew to get up. the anchor,
and calls \u25a0 for . the", captain to ; take ' the
â¢pilot house, but neither was responded
to. ,The : crew," sulked In their, quarters
and the captain trembled. in the cabin.
Colonel Joslyn < again came , to the res
. cue. : ""With-, a hammer, he ! knocked . tha
-shackle pin out of, the chain and let the

j When- the flatboat was stin fifty, feet

robbers had planned to grasp, her an
chor chain and swing alongside, and as
ehe headed away from them they, rent
the. air with their fierce sarcasms and
; concentrated 'their "fire " on ; the man â¢In
. the pilot house. Colonel Joslyn hid from
vfew.'but It was only for a moment. As
soon as the flatboat had drifted paat ho
not'only.'got up, but he called .'to '.Sir'
George, the Honorable .the Marquis and
all others who- could come. In* fifty;
words he told them his plan. Two min
utes later the steamer was describing sÂ»
< circle. When she- had' half -computed
It, .she was headed for. -the- robbers'
: craft. They fired 1 and shouted and used
their; oars," but ' she came driving along
\u25a0 and â¢ struck the flatboat \u25a0 on. her \ port
\u25a0 quarter 'and tore her â¢ stern - away. . As
she' struck â¢ there was a' fusillade from
.the,* cabin windows. Looking back in
the steamer's wake, the passengers
could-not discover a single swimmer.
It was a complete annihilation. When
he^ realized - this the ."captain regained

"There was but little to see near at

W OHN GRAY straightened his tired
I '. back and stood looking over the
\ ragged corn field, rather a dlsheart-
Qj eaing process. The straggling rows,
yellow, scanty, almost weed-choked, gave
15tde promise of future yields. The young
mar., despite the tired droop of figure
and discouraged eyes, presented a typo

six" feet, there was in bearing and
dear-cut features the nameless. Inde
structible something always present In
the true, pure-bred sons of the Old Do
zatilon. The boy with the patrician
face standing tired amid ; the rays of
the setting sun bad many counterparts
In the sad days of the late seventies.
Thea. came the sound of the hollow
exhaust of an old "diamond stack." the
cluttering- of wheels over rough unbal
lasted chair joint rails, and a freight
train rusibled past the field. As the
caboose passed a young man swung;
grace fclly to the ground. Quickly

be stood fade? Gray* who gazed in
tently upon the stranger. He saw a
Blender, bright-faced youth of bis own
fcgeâ about, twenty- â a jaunty silk cap
on his head, dressed In a suit of black
"basket work* worsted. . edges and
pockets faced " with \u25a0 Inch-deep silk
braid, an Inch well ran down the out
c:de of the troaser. leg? with sixteen
and a naif spiles' bottoms flaring over
alligator shoes with heavy inch exten
sion solesâ the correct dress of the f Ops
of the rail at that epoch.
"Hello!" lie said, as on coming to
John he wiped his bands on a piece of
waste. "Have you any water around
here?" . , .
"ThanlES,** after emptying the drip

"There Is something In the life that
brings you out; you might prance around
in a store, stoop " over a desk, or grub
around on a /arm all of your life and

up railroading you soon get to know
your limitations. If your feet tangle eas

wrecks waving a white flag at a cross

where I belong, about half way down
a lerty-zslnute hill stands an old farm
hocse. Our S3 passes there at 1:30 a. m.
In the front room the folks have a base
burner' coal stove. Farmer-like, they
leare the curtains of the windows up.
Now on a stinging January night I pass
on tcp of a train of 'decks' and the red
glow of the fire In the farmhouse laughs

continued, . "that he Is expected to do

afraid to do, and that he not only can
fill the bill but loves to do It. Take it at

hungry wolves, then as your lamp dies

are pinning their lives â you put lit under

on you to stop them O. X~, and you know
as you pitch from car to car and brake
to b/Take that you can do it.' but if you
would fail or skulk, hell would out for
noon. Can you understand what it means
to in the middle of the track to
toe - a footboard, a dinky yard engine
bearing down on you, and knowing if
your. "foot raises a fraction of a second
100 late, or if your hand should "j bÂ«
equally tardy in its -clutch at the hand

a "fraction cf a' second * between

If "ever ' a man on the roughest track
wuld run cars too fast for you, or if- for
oven a moment you would, think that the

Slowly' Jim raised his head. Extending
bis hand he grasped the. other's firmly.
"Yes, ril go. If father is. willing." -
"Father!" thought Frank, looking ?at
the goodly proportions of the young giant
standing- bef orW him, but for some reason
he wisely held his .peace/
"Come on, it's supper time," said John,
"and 111 take it up with him."

have noticed the brisht. keen young:

"How long did you brake?" asked
Howe.
'"Brake!" came the astonished answer.
while his very whiskers seemed to
writhe. in indignant protest.
"Brake; why" boy. I never twisted a
brake wheel or threw a link in my
life, and never threw but one switchâ
and then I put two cars on the ground,"
he added ruefully. "I was agent at Har
dlnsville. One day the general manager
came turkey hunting and I asked him
for. a train to run and got It. Have
been here since. Brake. Indeed!" he
muttered, as with erect head ho rolled
down the aisle.

Passing down Sixth street they crossed
to the lower open end of the train shed.
Two young fellows were seated on a,
truck. Listening, to their conversation
John heard scraps of "He's afraid to run

POBTLAN'D. May ...27.â "1n the continu
ous woods where rolls the Oregon and
lives no Eound save his own dashings."
8o Bryant phrased his conception of. the
awe-inspiring quietness of the vast region
drained by tUe mighty Columbia and its
tributaries. The years since have brought
great changes, and civilization sounds
now sweep over the plains and make the
echoes of the -wooded slopes to the snow
capped tops of many mighty peaks.
Tens of thousands are wending their
safe way to the great city that has grown
bo quickly to be the commercial center of*
a well devoloped and populous region, to
see the results of a few decades of Amer
ican enterprise and toil. And well re
warded will these be for the time and
cost of their travel. .Not in Kazan or
NiJnJ Novgorod, to whose fairs come longr
and richly laden caravans from India
and far Cathay, nor in the costly exposi
tion palaces of London, Paris and Vienna
have such pleasingly impressive and in
structive combinations of the art of man
and nature ever before been offered.
While the title of the exposition carries
the honored names of the great explor-'
ers who first bore . the American ' flag
across the untrodden plains, through tfte
forests, over., the mighty mountains and
along the great rivers to the shores of the
Pacific Ocean, its aim and purpose reach
far beyond the mere commemoration of
their names and deeds. The education of
the people of the United States and the
rest of the world, too, as to the progress,
prosperity and possibilities of the great
Northwest country is the larger, and the
main object of its being. ;
The Lewis and Clark Centennial i Ex
position is not for Oregon alone.' It is
the Oreg-on country's exposition,
. whether 'considered from the. patriotic
or the material viewpoint. It is as much
the exposition of Washington, Mon
tana, Idaho and Wyoming as -it is : :- of
Oregon. The, interest of all is Identlcal,
forkll in. whole or part comprised the
g-eographical division, the.acquisition
of which'established the -United; States
on the,,- Pacific Ocean and made It ; a
world power.
In a still broader sensed it is .the
West's exposition, for - Jefferson was
looking to the northwest coast for nearly.,
\u25a0 â¢ .-\u25a0 â¢ \u25a0 " \u25a0 I \u25a0 . ' .
twenty years before Barbe -Marbols, Jin
Napoleon's behalf, offered Jefferson's en
voys aJI of; Louisiana for 60,000,000 francs.'-
In the largest sense ' of all. it is . the
American people's exposition, -for:with
out the . expanse of â¢:- territory - Oregon,"
Louisiana, Texas, California, "Alaskar
Hawaii and the ; Philippines have ; given
the. United States^would not now "rank
among the great world nations. '
'The<name. Oregon first appeared Tin
print' -in -Jonathan Carver's "Travels
Through the i Interior Parts of * North
America,", which wwats t published ml ,Lon
-don in 1778. : The origin of ; the name r is
one of .the enigmas 2 of : history." Carver
professed ; to:: have - received i it from the
Indians in the; country 'of the Upper Mis
sissippi;- where ! ; he :\u25a0 had pushed his v ex
plorations. â¢ The Indians, he says, '; told
him;of the river Oregon, ' flowing .lo! the
western ocean, but i how. much of , the' tale
was his own invention'itis:impossible to
say. ; Jefferson * used the word â¢ in* his \u25a0 in
stractions â¢, to / Lewis and Clark, showing
it \u25a0 was beginning: ' to.^ have a \ vogue I before ;
'"Thanatopsis" .was written ; - but . it -was
Bryant's solemn ; poem, with its sonorous
verse, which appeared :in the Â£ year < 1817,"
that familiarized .word i "Oregon" I and
soon put it on every tongue. Various ac
counts of the -Lewis r and Clark: expedition
had : appeared,^ both , In I the ;. United ~ States
and Europe,; before Â£ the i ; : of
"Thanatopsis,'* ; but ;:\u25a0 it^ was
Bryant's : ; . expression, â¢ "Where ,, rolls '/ the
Oregon,", that did most: to ' spread : T the'

The; Oregon .country, which" passed.to
the sovereignty of .the United. -States by

appolnted in this and seriously alarmed
by the scarcity of their, f ood^supply, , the

on March, 23. 1506;,* .The; captains jleft
several copies of a paper describing
their.- Journey,, giving: some tor the na

On November 15, having traversed
the present States of Washington and
Oregon, the party reached .Cape Disap
pointment, and the eyes of the ..weary
trarelerp were -gladdened with- the
sight of the great ocean which had
been the goal of their efforts through
seventeen months ot dangerous ;and
toilsome Journeying-. It* was not until
the middle of December that they found
ground suitable for winter quarters,
and in the meantime they:had experi
enced great suffering, for the winter
rains had set -in and .there were no
conveniences for shelter, while the
hunters returned to camp day'after day
without -the same, which \ they c had
hoped td procure;for. food. v The winter
quarters' finally decided upon were lo
cated near Youngs Bay. In Clatsop
County, where :l they -.erected a rude
fortification which, they* named .Fort
Clatsop, v ln honor of "the tribes of In
uiar.s : in; that rfglon.
Â£t once recognized as the tribe from
which sho had been stolen years be
fore by the enemies of fier people, the
Mandan?. It developed that the chief
of the ShoshoneS was a brother of thÂ«
"bird woman," and he did all In his
power to aid the travelers.
Learning from the Indians that the
water route was impracticable, * thÂ«s
party was divided, and? the advance, un
der the direction of/ Captain Clark,
crossed the Kittcr Root Mountains by
the Lolo trail into what is now Idaho,
suffering Intensely from cold and hun-
Kcr. and on the 20th of September
reached a villaefc of Nez Perce Indiana.
The Xez Ferces received themhospita
bly, and thf- famished travelers ate so
heartily of the food supplied by their
Ravage hosts that many of them were
taken sick, including Captain Clark.
The other, party joined that of Cap
tain Clark on the banks of the Koos
koosky, or Clearwater River, where
they left in charge of the friendly Nez
Percc-8 the horsas that had carried them
across the mountains and built canons.
The ranoes being constructed, they em
barked -in October on their Journey
down the Olearwater. and connecting
streams for th^ Pacific. The. travelers
were at this time in most ' deploraM-i
physical condition, the majority ssufferr r
ing from some ailment, and their con
dition did not Improve. Whereas they
had for some time been subsisting on
roots, fish, horse meat and an occa
sional deer, crow or wolf, their resort,
when out of -other food, now became
the wolfish dogs which they purchased
from the Indians. \u25a0
REACH THE COLUMBIA.
After much. - suffering the .traveler*
reached the Snake River, which they
named "Lewis." .Going down this
stream to the Columbia,. they followed
that river, passing in safety a number
of. rapids, and on' the : 21st of October
reached the Cascades.,

NATURE * OP.. THE TRAIL.
earller world's fairs. The "Trail." as the
amusement street of the^Western World's
Fair is . called, is situated on a wide
bridge which spans Guilds Lake, the na
tural "grand, basin" of the exposition.'
The number 'and. quality of the attrac
tions secured for the '"%airt' are in ac
cord with the fitness of its. location.
Exposition history tells us that 'the first
amusement street was located in Chi-'
cago in'.lSM. It was suggested that the
public, after gazing for \ hours upon the
marvels of modern civilization, .would
take -boyish delight in amusements of a
lighter nature. At the time,- the Midway
Plalsance .was an experiment;, but it
proved i a remarkable success. \u25a0 Every one
who attended the World's Columbian
Exposition told the' stay-at-homes how
much higher, was the Ferris. wheel than
the ; steeple on the - ', Methodist church,
and whistled the tune he had heard play
ed on screeching , horns .by bloomer-clad
men in front of an Oriental -theater. The
public - that tired of , one of the ' greatest
mechanical ; marvels of \u25a0 the century con
tinued to be the willing, slave of the
bloomer. . man ; with ., the- 1 screeching horn
who- tooted the Oriental air.
' When San Francisco held , its Mid
winter . Exposition the following year a
midway _ was *a dominating feature and
the people : liked . it. Then followed
fairs at: Buffalo, Omaha, Nashville.
Charleston,' ; Atlanta and St. Louis, and
each had | its. amusement street, and .the
people liked -them all. At St. Louis the
amusement feature saw its ' climax; in
a street called the "Pike,"- where shows
ranging from -very good to very * bad
clamored .for patronage along a Â« mile
of , pandemonium.

AniIASGEMEXT OF DISPLAY..
Right inside the main entrance of the
California building is an exhibit that will
make the stranger remember what first
! made the State' famous. Here Is tine mm- j
I ing exhibitâ samples of ore, exhibitions i
of .how the ere is' treated from the \u25a0. time j
it is first discovered and many rare speci
mens of minerals. Other distinctive fea
tures are also clustered about the prin
cipal portal.
In the big south v/ing is the horticul
tural exhibit. This includes the forestry
annex, which is now being arranged in I
most attractive style.. All the products
of the orchardâ oranges, prunes, peaches,
; and so on, are set forth in a display that
makes the mouth . water.
The products of "the vineyard are be
ing gathered into the . wide west wing.
The work of the agriculturist is also set |
forth. The specimens of grapes alone will j
make the Eastern sightseer sit up and i
take notice. -.'\u25a0'\u25a0 S
A big lecture-room occupies a large part
of the north wing. Here are also the of
ficers' living quarters and the administra
tion offices. Exhibits; of fish and game
will occupy the , remaining space. In the
hall . near the temporary oiuce is now
resting the body of a ferocious black sea
bass, ; apparently keeping guard on the
office door. .
* Under the , dome in the center- of-' the
building : is a : high, many-stepped hexa-;
gon. This is to be the one spot where
any distinction as' to the geographical ; di
visions ".' of : the commonwealth will be \ al
lowed. 'The Bide facing ; the entrance will
be reserved for the State at large, : and
some choice mineral exhibits will : be ar
ranged there. The San Joaqulnand the
Sacramento : valleys : will each be repre
sented by a flight of steps holding, fruit
of various kinds. x The coast counties, the
bay counties .and Southern . California
have each a face of thehexagon.- i
Three thousand feet of space has
been allotted to the Agricultural build
ing for big exhibits that cannot .be
housed -in the State buildings. Thou
sands of dollars have been spent by
California firms in'showingthe product
of field, orchard' and garden, / 2. Vege
tables and fruit, preserved and canned,
are displayed In'great" variety. '
PaJms . and . decorative - trees and
plants of all sorts will be used at the
entrance tothe State building. Orange,
lemon and' olive trees are to *be in
stalled about the immediate; grounds,
while potted- plants from., California
will be used effectively in the ' interior
of the* building.- Tnree cars will bring
these products â¢: ftom the south, and
so abundant will the-supply be that the
eoniinlESioners? with California's gener
osity, have . promised .the '\u25a0 fair officials
a carload ' for use \u25a0\u25a0\u25a0 at other places -on
the fcroundft. These borrowed -plumes
will be marked,; so that credit wiir be
given to 'owners.
These plants and . trees are: from Gold
en Gate Park.' In San" Francisco, ".the State
Hospital -grounds': at Stockton Â» and \u25a0 a car

Commissioner Filcher says in ' many
respects the exhibit from California at
the Lewis and Clark Fair will be far
better than at the St. Louis exposi
tion. This is especially notable in the
showing of minerals and gems. One
case of gold.. including nuggets, quartz
and dust, will represent; a cash value
of $10,000. Seventy varieties of gems
the product of California fields, are
worth at least 550,000. In this de
partment an exhibit of a cement com
pany will attract a great deal of atten
tion. It Is a Yosemite Falls, in miniature,
with every detail perfect, - and water
falling Just .as it does in the famous
national park.
The display will be distinctly a
State affair, and with the exception of
the Agricultural building will be shown
tinder one roof. No section will be es
pecially recognized, save in one A>r
two Instances, but everything will- be
subordinated to showing the rich and
varied resources of this State as a
whole. This Is following out the idea
of Director of Exhibits Dosch. In great
measure, ajid is somewhat of a novelty.
In previous exhibitions of this charac
ter, the displays have been placed in
different classes and placed in different
buildingsâ agriculture, mining, etc.
WHERE EXUIDIT EXCELS.
California's display will be ready the
opening day of the exposition. Car
loads of exhibits are stored in the
building ready to be installed when
the carpenters have finished putting in
the shelving. Commissioners Filcher
and Wiggins are working with untir
ing energy and feel very sanguine as
to results.
These social functions will be a
feature at the California building. On
the second floor of the executive quar
ters there is a comparatively small re
ception room, which will be used as a
refreshment room on great occasions.
This room opens out on the art gal
leries and the guests will' promenade
among the artistic things gleaned
from California treasure-houses on
carpets especially prepared for these
occasions. When the reception is over
the floor coverings will be removed,' to
be laid aside until time for another
function.
It is in the north wing â the Mission
of El Coronado â that the official family
will be quartered during the life of the
fair. Governor p"ardee and his family
will have a summer house here. The
| Governor's duties at home will n6t per
mit his long residence at the fair, but
Mrs. Pardee, as hostess, will preside
over all social functions and th*y will
be many, assisted by ladies from her
State at various times. Of course, the
big day will be September 9, California
day.
The building itself is in the form of
a Greek cross. Following out the idea
of Governor George G. Pardee '> of
California, each wing is a re
production of. an old Spanish mission.
Vhe great front of San Antonio de
l'adua faces the rising sun and the
rcain entrance is through this wing. On
tht south is the Mission of San Luis
Key, with the chimes from the Mission
Hotel at Riverside and an expert to
jingle the sweet bells in tune. The
art gajjgrjr, occupies : the upper, part of
the vtt^U. wing, made to represent the
Mission of Dolores. From the win
dows of this part of the great building
a magnificent open view is had of the
sweep of the lake toward the hills, bits
'if green lawn, shrubbery and beds of
flowers in the foreground, while in the
middle distances are the tents of the
exposition guards, the Trail and far to
the right 'the stately Government build
ing on its island fastness.
Built on the highest knoll within the
limits of the fair grounds, the Califor
nia building adjoins the Oriental
building on the west and has for a near,
neighbor the already famous monster
log cabin that contains Oregon's for
estry display, while the Washington
State building is Immediately across
the avenue to the north.
On the south are several acres of
ground, laid out in a perfect gem of a
park. In which the natural shrubbery
has been used very effectively, giving
the building a setting, enjoyed by no
other building: on the grounds. Sev
eral great fir-/ trees, survivors of a
once mighty forest that once occupied
this hillock, stand straight and tall,
as if conscious of their great height.
This bit of park gives one the impres
sion of quiet and calm, as if it were a
part of the walled-in garden of some
cloister, cultivated for. centuries by the
hands of men set apart from the world.
PORTLAND. May 27.â Sweet chimes
ringing out from the tower of a replica
of the old Spanish mission will call the
attention of the fairgoers to by far
the most unique State building on the
Lewis and Clark Fair grounds." Cali
fornians will have reason to be very
well pleased when they view the work
of their commissioners.

To be sure, the trained nurse, selected
lor her knowledge and general fitness
tor the care of a little body and tho
tiny Intelligence within \u25a0 it, ' was emi
nently better fitted -to assume care of
the baby than the little mother, loving
but ignorant^-butTnot bo ignorant as
not to realise that ebe was Ignorant-the
first blessed step' toward knowledge.
But having raised collies before and
never babies, and /being, less, awed by
the doggies' demands.. tbe little mother
undertook thair > upbringing,. i n which,
by the way, she succeeded admirably
Meanwhile, the babe grew and pros
pered, the little' mother never relin

thus she now ,number,a in, her household
. Now. for this very sensible proceed
lng^-beins a young mother and knowing
naught of the cars "of babiesâ this little
-woman has unconsciously brought down
upon society the wrath of the "outs "
The dog show Is past and gone, but,
' like a comet, leaves a trail behind..
To be sure, it enabled the smart maid
and xnatron to display - .to a wide-eyed
public their adorable \ Pomeranians,
their beauteous pugs, or their soulful
Dachshunde â linked sweetness, long
drawn outâ but this revealed a joy pos
session that was as nothing compared
â¢with the ecstasy that fell to the West
ern Wattersons, whose chief joy in life
lies in seeking out the sins of society
and baying about them to the moon.
To be sure, society, as with any other
phase of life, Is a^ little short of right
." eousness; but its* sins are Individual,
not collective, and to attribute the
"shortcomings of a few society women
to society collectively is to mark the
censor for a prevaricator or a fool.
: Ever since the doggies returned to
-their boudoirs from the draughts of the
-Pavilion, talk has been going the
.rounds of the tea tables of a well
ltnown woman to whose home there
.came simultaneously a wee little baby
â¬lrl and a pair of wee little collies.
Realizing her inability to care for the
baby and the collies as befitted each,
Bh'e hired a trained nurse for the baby
and assumed the care of the collies her

LONDON, May 27. â When Mr. and
Mrs. W. E. Carter of Newport, R. L,
were -In England last year they gave
instructions to a well-known firm of
house and land ag-ents to secure a
country residence for them, In view of
an anticipated visit this season. The
agents told Carter then that it -would
be much easier to secure a London
house during the time which Is known
as the London season than to Snd a

on their estates a chance of making a
little extra money.
Mrs. Carter, however, declared that
she must have a country residence in
England at any cost, and so a fine man
sion called "The Croft," near Rugby, in
Warwickshire, has been leased for her
not merely for the season but for a num
ber of years. It is on the property of the
Earl of Crewe and has not had a per

situated in a district noted for hunting
and polo, to both of which forms of

He was a lawyer, \ builder,' architect,
statesman, clockmaker. church restorer
and author, and possessed of unbounded
faith In his ability in whatever he did.
He gloried in controversy and enjoyed
nothing bo much as having a flght on his
hands.- The estate consists of something
over 3000 acres, and Lord Grlmthorpe left
In addition a large fortune and as a suc
cessful banker his nephew has already, ac
cumulated a snug little sum of his own. .
The late Lord GriiSthorpe was by no
means an Isolated example of longevity
in the British aristocracy. There are
several Peers still living whose existence
disproves the popular notion that wealth
and titles promote early decrepitude.
Lord Gwydyr has just entered upon his
ninety-sixth year. Lord Field will be 92
in August, and the Earl of Cranbrook,
once the vigorous and eloquent -debater,'
and Gathorne Hardy, who ousted Glad
stone from the representation of Oxford
Unlversiter, win be SI next October.
Lord Masham became a nonogenarlan
last January end he is stiHa'good shot;
Lord Brampton will be 88 In September
and the Duke of "Jutland 87 in December.
Several other noblemen might be men
tioned who have passed tne four-score
milestone and are still strong. :
The new Lord \u25a0' Grimthor^pe is 49 years
old and for many years has represented
the Whltby division of Yorkshire in Par
liament. He is a good speaker and a man
of considerable ability, but he does not
possess that diversity of talents and as
tounding energy which caused â¢ his uncle
to be regarded as one of the most remark
able men of his time. . . . >
LONDON, May 27.â 8y the death of that
wonderful old man. Lord Grimthorpe, in
his eighty-ninth year, another American
woman enters the charmed circle of the
British Peerage. The title passes to the
late nobleman's nephew, Ernest William
Beckett, who over, twenty years ago mar
ried Miss Lucy Tracy Lee of Xew York.
In consequence the former Miss Lee \u25a0 now
becomes Lady Grimthorpe.

Missouri River. 7 Accordingly, = on; July

course on the train. The little red grip
was never out of his hand while travel
ing, and the girls dubbed him 'His
Satchlets.' On the day of our opening in
Los Angeles he told me he had engaged
a box, but that night he didn't appear
and we've never seen him since."
"Nor discovered who he was?" I in
quired.
"Oh, yes," Dill chipped In. "The hotel
man at Los Angeles told us , 'His Satch
lets' was about' to start for the theater
when a middle-aged lady tapped ; his
shoulder and quietly said, 'Come home!',
a command which he did not attempt to
question. He paid his bill, picked up
the little grip and meekly toddled after
the â¢ woman. She was his wife, and it
Was to fire her jealousy that he trav
eled with, us.- He had a habit of. doing
that sort of thine, the hotel man said.
Every time he quarreled with his better
half he packed his little grip, hastened
to the nearest road show and thereto
attached himself until she recaptured
him. A less prepossessing. chap would
be hard to find, but his wife , imagined
he was an irresistible lady-killer. They
lived on a farm somewhere and had lots
of money."
Then the tall comedian told of how
the principal^ performers of the aggre
gation rode fromLodi'to Stockton in a
stuffy day coach of the regular local
train while the ladies of the chorus
made the trip in automobiles hired and
steered by gallant. youths of the former
town 1 whom they, had entranced about a
week previously.. '
. "It was really exhilarating," said
Kolb, "to see the girls and their escorts
dash past our train . and then slack up
until we overtook 1 them,: when they
would salute us with a cheer and dash
away again. . Our train' was a kind- of a
cold molasses special, you know. The
ladies with us said- ; they enjoyed it
hugely, but I didn't believe them." -

LAURA BRIDE POWERS
IS THE ISTITUTE OF ART PROVINCIAL IN ITS TEACHING?
"He was a queer customer," Kolb ex
plained for my information. "He occu
pied a box every evening and smiled at
every girl on the stage whose eye he
caught, and after his second evening he
was kept busy emiling-, I can tell you.
At the hotel he left instructions that If
the girls fancied any extras, such as
ice cream or lemonade, they were to be
provided at his expense. But he never
spoke to any of them, and shunned con
verse with our men, whose curiosity
prompted them to draw him Into dis-
"Do you remember the weazened and
sun-tanned little fellow with the red
gripsack who Journeyed with us from
San Jose to Los Angeles and never
missed a show?" Kolb asked Dill. .
â¢ "Can I ever forget him?" Dili replied
to Kolb.
"The flowers those girls left behind
them would glut the New York market
on Decoration day," said Mr. Kolb.
"And the fruit they accepted and
could neither -eat nor conveniently
carry away is pitiful to think about
now." Mr. Dill regretfully sighed.
â¢ "The morning getaway was usually
very affecting." Mr. Kolb rejoined. "We
always preceded the girls to the depot,
and to see them come trooping: along,
each accompanied by a young man
bearing her satchel and the souvenirs
she had captured, was a beautiful sight.
Then came the partings when the train
rolled in â the promises to write soon
and the hat waring and handkerchief
flourishing when the train rolled out.
Oh, ft was pretty, even if It was of
daily occurrence, with a complete
change In the male personnel/*
â¢ "Not always complete," Mr. Dill cor
rected. "You mustn't overlook the two
smitten chaps who traveled with us
from Bakersfield on the back Jump. Our
next stand was Stockton, and their in
tention was to accompany their inamo
ratas all the way, but at Tracy, where
we had a layover for luncheon, the two
guileless maidens whom the cavaliers
were attached to invited the other
twenty-two g. m.'s to eat at the ex
pense of Gus and Charlie, and the re
sult was that Gus and Charlie concluded
their trip right there, because they did
not have enough cash left to purchase
return fares from Stockton. That was
the most tender farewell I . ever saw.
Ben Dillon's e*ye> ' were moist as he
watched Gus and Charlie sadly wave
theJr hands after the train."
Kolb and Dill and their principal aids
and choral and terpsichorean support
have returned to San Francisco with
unanimous announcement that their six
weeks' tour of Central and Southern
California was a financial and artistic
triumph for themselves and an educa
tional boon for many of the communi
ties visited. They presented two score
people, richly equipped with talent and
picterial accessories, in places that had
never been honored with anything more
pretentious in the theatrical line than
"Uncle Tom's Cabin," with^our or five
'players in thrice as many parts, or
â¢ "Ten Nights in a Barroom," with local
amateurs in the cast. Thus their trip
was akin to a missionary pilgrimage,,
inasmuch as It conveyed the light of
creditably produced musical comedy to
benighted localities.
"We have 6howed In more than . one
town," said Mr. Kolb, notoriously vera
cious, "that had been stirred to its very
depths by the coming of Sue Suken's
Repertoire Dramatic Company of seven
; members, and confessed to having been
plunged into excess of enthusiasm by
the promised treat of an illustrated lec
ture on the capture of Port Arthur.
Need I say that the popular interest in
those noteworthy events, at thel time
all-absorbing, faded Into nothingness
when compared with the excitement
aroueed by the advent of the Kolb and
Dill travesty organization, forty strong,
and including a beauty chorus of twen
ly-four, fresh from the biggest theater
:n 'the city'? I won't encroach upon
your valuable time by imparting: the
information that we made things hum."
"'Especially the beauty chorus." said
Mr. Dill, no less famed than his elon
gated partner for adherence to fact.
Then the comedians alternated in
reminiscence of their trials while
escorting two dozen attractive young
women, for whose safe return to the
place of beginning they had given
pledge to exacting relatives, over a cir
cuit never before traveled by such a
large crowd. Dwellers In populous
cities, where Boubrettes and ballet
dancers and chorus girls are an every
night occurrence, cannot appreciate the
fearful joy that possesses a people
whose accustomed round of g-ayety con
eists of an occasional- church social or
a magic lantern exhibition when a
stupendous and dazzling array of
youthful, pretty and talented femininity
drops into their midst and the alluring
glitter of a real metropolitan "girl
show" assails them for one entire even
ing, or maybe two. The spell cast over
a steady-going- rural community by
such an unwonted taste of urban mag
netism is enough "to make a blase
patron of such amusement weep and
pine for his salad days and illusions.
But it was not while the girls were
on the Ft ago that the souls of their
managers were -wrenched by anxiety.
To keep out the bucolic Johnnies â a
species even . more exasperating than
the city chappies â was the task of a
faithful doorkeeper, whom every mas
culine member of the company was
ready to "back "with muscle. If neces
sary. It was the period bet-ween .the
afternoon arrival at the depot and the
evening roll call in the theater that
vexed the guardians of -the charmers.
The passing of the girls down Main
street, \u25a0with their citified air and ap
parel, almost stopped traffic. Pedes
trians got off the sidewalks and in
awe-struck groups gazed at them. Ad
miring: callow youth laid off work and
dawdled at the postofflce, Etsenheim
er's dry goods store, the stationer's
shop, where the New York Clipper was
for sale, and other points of interest to
the fair visitors, and the hotel office
looked like a run on a bank. In the
evening the stage door could only be
approached through a lane of Immature
manhood, laden with floral gifts for the
ladies. . ,

Richard Strauss has finished all but the
final orchestration of the opera he found
ed on Oscar Wilde's play, "Salome." The
drama has frequently been acted with
great success In Germany and was once
given in Parts. It is of course prohibited
in England on account of Its Biblical sub
ject, but might readily be acted here. The
opera will be sung first In Dresden next

Ernest Van Dyck is trying", to build a
theater at Ostend which will take all the
honors of Bayreuth. It exists as yet only
on paper, although the tenor says he is
certain that the scheme will soon be car
ried through. The capital necessary is
$400,000 and this has been divided into 200
shares of $2000 each. The cost of the
ground and the building will be $520,000.
The opera-house will be similar to that
of Bayreuth in its Internal arrangement
and will seat S9OO persons. The prices will
range from $10 ..t0 $1 and the season Is
to consist of twenty- two performances
every year, beginning in the first week of.
May and continuing to August. In spite
of. the dedication of the theater to, Wa
gner and* his operas, the first work to be
sung there will be "Don Giovanni."
which will not be entrusted to German
singers. This will be followed by two
cycles of the Ring. It Is. Intended to give
later a cycle of the Berlioz operas, in
cluding "La* Damnation de Faust". in
operatic , form. Since 'â¢ Jean de Reszke
built, his famous opera-house In Paris on
a sheet of Gllsey House paper and out
lined a plan of campaign which remains
unfulfilled to this day. public confidence
in tenors' opera-houses has not been
great. But M. Van Dyck's scheme Is
nevertheless '. interesting.
â¢W. J. Henderson, musical critic, writes
a most interesting article on "Has Music
Ethical Force?" : He tries to prove the
negative by showing In many Instances
where " the musio of a prayer has been
used as a love son?, and he says also
that the music of "Tristan and Isolde"
would not ' be wickedly passionate with
out the textâ that In fact, music simply
emphasizes the text by providing a lyri
cal declamation for it. The Krentaer
Sonata he disposes of by saying that it
was misunderstood, that the mild melo
dies of Beethoven could not possibly have,
done any harm. Then he contradicts him
self by assuring us that music 'can .ex
press emotions, passionate and otherwise,
and that as music cannot proclaim prin
ciple it has no ethical .value.

next week ' ( at -the Majestic, In New

"been no dissent from the praise accorded

The marriage. of white and negro la pro
hibited by law. in the State of California.
A County; Clerk 13 not authorized.; to-is
sue a license for the marriage of a .white
and a negro, and if '. perchance * . license
for such a marriage should, be Issued , no
one' authorized to solemnize a marriage
would do so on account of the legal pro
hibition. ;
MATERIALS of construction are -the chief subject of the
latest issue of the California Promotion Committee's mag
azine, "For California." While the showing the
rapid development of the industries of putting these on the market
are very gratifying, perhaps the most striking effect of the publica
tion will be to show how much there is for promotion to do in in
ducing development of the wealth of resource the State has in such
materials; In one line of delayed development alone there is given
a startling computation of what is* being lost from want of enter
prise anrl inventive skill. It is estimated that $60,000,060 a year 2:,
sent out of California for its tableware of china and glass, although
there is kaolin clay enough to make most of the china .-used.Vand
there is the right kind of sand to make all the glass.' This -.immense
home market which can be closely approximated is but a suggestion
of the export trade that might follow fronr. the success of pro
ducing the supplies needed for Jocal consumption. . . "
A good example of -what might be done in other lines isshown
by the rapid increase of brickmaking here. We have been making
bricks since 1850, but, commercially speaking^ the California brick
" trade is but eleven years old. In that time rnorethan 1,000,660^00,
000 of bricks have been made. We always had the clay ; the profita
ble, use of it came about from the adoption of iniproved methods 'of
its manufacture. -That is a reminder that we have in the- idle Hron
ore a big undeveloped resource; its utilization is only awaiting' inf
ventive skill and enterprise to inaugurate improved methods .per
haps.no more impossible'to the accomplishment,' of â¢human faculty
than were the achievements in brick- production. ;
The apparent difficulty now is that'the ore and the- proper fuel
. arc-not in the same locality; but the" real reason may be tliat in
genuity has not bestirred itself sufficiently to ': find out that some
other sort of fuel would do by a different method ; of. application. l
The lesson of the bricks may be v only distantly analogous, but by r
â¢ its sudden development it points to fine 'possibilities: ySome of Uhe ;
resources that arc 'in need of further develop'ment^are granite, mar
bfe^mineral paint, sandstone arid concrete 'but these are
progressing in spite of the fact that some 'of r our builders:have-im
ported from: other States ; in the items of iron, steel farid "glass,' the
Opportunities still await the men.

fine-reproduction of the work of the great Italian artist, Arturo Noel.

hotels. This was an estimate previous to last year; and^we can only
look upon those figures as an approximation of theXaverage-'de
struction which is going on now.
The sting'of this presentation of facts lies in the knowledge
that almost all of \u25a0 this waste of wealth and life is preventable. The
public : should take a keen interest in the matter because - they have
it in their power/to hasten the* time of general .fireproof construction.
If is not; a matter^ for insurance "companies, municipal-governments
and building , contractors only ; ; : tenants should persistently \u25a0 object;
to Venting; inflammable dwellings, apartment-houses and places^ for
their offices, and wherever possible the people should emphasize
their preference for living in houses and in- neighborhoods where
proper fireproofing has been made i a feature of construction.
;V."---: . It has been \u25a0 estimated . that ; the ..cost of . building in a way to be
safe from fire , is only 10 per cent" more than ;the risk-taking- method,
and that the , good building deteriorates 1 only ". one-ninth Vof 1 _ per

THE ABUSE OF HORSES.
THE range of human interest is 'as wide as the -universe. .The ;
field is so large that if one undertake to keep it all in order, he
will regret being born' into a world and" time* so out of joint.-
A newspaper is' indulged in near and- longdistance efforts to keep
things straight over the whole range, from local politics to" the
svzygy.of the heavenly bodies. Therefore let us get -the ear of the
S. P . C. A/ and talk about our old four-footed friend, the horse. -
And. why not?. The horse shares with woman. the gift, of the
greatest animate physical beauty, and the classification does thelady
no discredit: As for man. his partner in pulchritude is .away down
the line, probably a mule and maybe a burro. The horse ranks
high in our admiration and appreciation nor alone because he is
handsome, but because be is patient, agije and useful. The bicycle
and automobile have boasted of putting him down and out, but he
comes up with a smile en his noble face and a bigger price on his
bone and muscle every year. The chug wagon and that Satanic in
vention, the motorcycle, may pass him on the road, but they can
never pass him in man's esteem and friendship. We write en
nobling books about him, which he cannot read of course, but they
make humanity better, and the horse knows that something has hap
pened because he gets better treatment. We found colleges in. which
to teach veterinary science and train doctors to diagnose the dis
eases of these helpless and speechless patients. \u0084,-. . , .
Man has been made better by being humane to the horse.
When Berg started- in to reform the treatment of domestic. animals
it 'was because the bad treatment of the horse aroused his sym
pathy. The system that he originated has resulted in the better
treatment of all domestic animals, including cats and dogs, and has.
even put the quality of mercy into the destruction of predatory ani
mals. It is no longer permissible to entrap rats and kill them by
shaking them out into the fire: So the brute creation owes a great
.debt to the horse, for he started all this by impressing Mr. Berg.
We desire to call attention to the need of greater watchfulness
in behalf of the horse. It is needed in all large cities, because itis
supposed that anybody can drive a horse, and that noble animal is
frequently driven by a boy or man who is his inferior in general
information on the subject of pulling loads, backing up and the
whole haw and gee scheme. When an ignorant driver has failed
to make himself understood by his horse, because he lacks horse
sense himself, he proceeds to whip the poor beast. The driver will
not work unless his boots fit and his clothes are comfortable. But
he gives no thought to whether the horse millinery fits or not. The
trace chains may cut through the skin, the collar may gall the
shoulders, and chafe the withers raw, but as long as the driver's
withers are unwrung he will beat the galled jade for wincing.
How many times a day do we see overloaded horses slip and
fali on our streets! Usually this is caused by careless driving. The
driver is gawping around and pays no attention to the kind of foot
ing upon which he is forcing his team. Falls are. frequent on street
railroad tracks because the horses are forced to take the rail length
wise, and its slippery surface furnishes no foothold. Then, as a*rule,
when the horse, for no fault of his own, has slipped, fallen, skinned
his knees and bruised his ribs, he is brutally beaten by the driver.
When this happens why not go to that driver and ask him how he
would like to be beaten with a club for falling down with a- pack
on his, back? He will revile you if you do this. He will make you
an object of unpleasant interest on the street and may offer violence;
still your inquiry, if dispassionately -made and patiently; persisted
in, may set even such a man to thinking.
It seems to us necessary to call public attention? to the abuse
Cvf horses. A critic may say that a newspaper may better confine
its humane appeals to man~ and his need of improved treatment.
But we have observed that where dumb beasts are treated best
there ma~n is treated best also. Our noble four-footed brother, the
horse, contributes to our comfort and pleasure in so many ways
that we do not wonder that certain theosophists and others who
believe in metempsychosis declare that they can remember When
they were horses. If such things have to be, we would greatly prefer
remembering ourself as a horse to being compelled to remember
that we were any of several kinds of men we have known. If these
reminiscences are true, so much the more need of kindness- to a
horse. The faithful beast that serves us and lunches on barley in
his nosebag may have Emerson inside of him, or Tennyson. Treat
him well and keep' the whip off his hide that may be the- roof over
the head of a philosopher, poet or statesman.

'I thought perhaps the one you speak of

I asked about the spelling.
â¢The boys were nearly choking ' with
suppressed laughter at my discomfiture

crowd to discuss other ; matters. I felt
desperate and started in again. _ %
" 'Weli.' the conductor, he said to Brans

only to Crofton." But Billy had seen a
mighty pretty girlâ â *
" 'Must have been the same Billy Brans

great fellow after the girls. I remember
on one occasionâ â V ;
"Here two more of the party left . and

"HOUSE IN THE MIST,"

Best . of all things in the book Is fhe
study of that Maxim Gorkiy \u25a0 who has. so
suddenly, established -a^ literary [reputa

and a poet, ' and he 4'has ; found at \u25a0 last
that, happy combination ;of ? realism r wf?h
Idealism for which.the!Russian*folk-nov
cllsts have . been ; striving for so many
years." . One t of the great .'. things 'about
Gorkiy, is the new trumpet'note'of.cour
age and. energy ; he puts lntbiÃussiari* lit-,
erature and gives to all his readers. He
cannot stand whining.-:. Take "-'this one

(McClure. Phillips & Co., New Yorkl 1 $2.)
Fine, almost lovingly fine, Is tho ap
preciative sketch of the remarkable
poet, Nekrasoff, -who was the poet su
perlative above all :' others In singing
his love and -respect for his mother.
He was fed continually on black mis
ery. For three years he was. hungry
every day â living on bread. . "In
whatever Nekrasoff wrote there Is an
Inner force, and this force suggests
to;him Images which are rightly con
sidered the pearls of Russian poetry."
In the %*ery Interesting account of Tol
st&y'e works the , author says : "He has
fearlessly stated the moral aspects of all
the burning questions of the \u25a0 day.v i n â¢ a
form so deeply; lmpressive that whoever
has read any, one of his writings can no
longer forget these questions or set' them
aside. ; In millions of " copies his : worÃs
are read In all language?. Tolstoy. Is now
the most loved manâ the most touchingly
loved manâ ln the world." . y - "
Concerning the wit and humor of
Gogol's novels: "It Is the good
hearted laughter of a young man who
himself enjoys the fullness of life
and himself laughs at the comical po
sitions in which he has put his he
roes." And then comes a quotation
from the poet. Pushkin, . about Gogol's
productions: "Behind his laughter
you feel his unseen tears." '.
Only briefly can some of the greater
writers studied In this volume be men
tioned. Of Turgueneff. whom Kropot
kin estimates the greatest novelist of
his century, we are told: "In common
with all great writers, Turgueneff
combined the dualities of a pessimist
and a lover of mankind," ', and
that he knew the.human heart deeply,
"especially the heart of a young girl
when she awakes to higher feelings
and. ideas, and that awakening takes,
without her realizing it, the shape of
love." ' ...\u25a0\u25a0-., :.â¢
Probably no other mind and heart
could have been so much desired by. us
to give us a concise study of Russian
letters up to date. The only other who
could have spoken so Interestingly Is
Tolstoy, and that would hot do, for
Tolstoy is too big to be* left but of
the book as a study by a great man
not himself. Kropotkin's' work will
certainly incite a desire to look, more
deeply into the great things of Rus
sian literature. He knows well the
art of quotation, and the brief extracts
he si yes from the master writers
quickly arouse appetite to read their
novels, short stories and philosophical
criticisms. . '
ture is that . Kropotkin wrote it. To
read an account of the great Russians
by a great Russian is a big privilege, and
so much does the nihilist phaosopher re
veal his own greatness by his criticisms
and appreciations that we cannot regret
the Item of himself being; left out from
the list of subjects studied." Some of the
fine tnings jhe gives from himself inci
dentally are about Idealism, with which
his own nature is abundantly blessed.
He explains how in great Russian lit
erature realistic description must.be sub
servient to idealistic aim: and speaking
of the years when one strives to get rid
of the Imperfections of boyhood and girl
hood he says . the only proper way is to
"open before the young. mind new, broad
horizons; to frec.Jt from superstition and
fears; to" grasp man's "position amidst na
ture and mankind;, and especially, to feel
at one with some great cause and to
nurture one's forces with the view of
being able some day to struggle for that
cause. Idealismâ that is, the capacity of
conceiving a poetical love toward some
thing great and to prepare for Itâ ls the
only sure preservation from all that de
stroys the vital forces of man: vice, dis
sipation and so on."

KROPOTKIX In his new
book, '"Russian Literature."
makes clear to us why it
is true that in Russia
literature is of more im
portance, relative to all
other things, than it is in any other
Fart of the civilized world. A knowl
edge of this great Importance inten
sifies the interest with which we read
this great Russian's study of the master
writers of his country and note his ex
planations of, why the art of the Rus
sian masterpieces means so much more
for the welfare of the Slav race than
<3o*s the literary art of any other land
to its native people. Very remarkable,
too. Is Prince Kropotkin's statement of
the value of literary criticism and the
influence of the foremost Russian
. critics over Russian thought and life.
Indeed if one wishes to read the new
volume understanding^* and get the
best out of it, it is well to skip all the
forward part of the work in order to
begin with that portion far toward the
end called literary criticism; after those
few pages are gone over then all the
rest of the book will double Its appeal
to sympathetic and appreciative atten
tion.
After having made us understand the
greatness of literature to Russia,
Kropotkin tells us that during the last
half ceatÂ«ry-'-\Ve have had a. succession
" of art critics who have exercised upon
the intellectual aspects of their own
times a far greater, and especially a
far more widespread influence than any
r.wvelist or any writer in any other do
main." He states that the critic of a
leading review is the intellectual leader
at the younger generation. This is be
cause literary criticism in Russia has
certain special aspects. "It is not
\u25a0limited to a criticism of works of art
from a purely literary or esthetic point
of view â¢ â¢ â¢ but there are in
finitely more important questions which
are raised in the thoughtful mind by
. every work of really good art. â¢ â¢ â¢
In a good work of art the actions of
the heroes are evidently what they
would have been under similar condi
tions in reality; otherwise it would not
be good art. They can be discussed as
facts of life."
From this it follows that the literary
critic discusses the whole of life by tak
ing the more serious of the Russian
novels for his text. An illustration of the '
power these critics have even in appar
ently little things is given in the record
\u25a0of a minor success of Pisareff, who was
one of the four greatest critics. An au
thor of a Russian novel had described
in it a certain type of girl, and Pisareff
in commenting on It said the girl was not
invented, but that such by thousands
upon thousands really were. He called
themâ just for a handleâ "Muslin Girls."
Kropotkin says that every girl Jn every
educated Russian family read that article,
and that he thereby Induced many thou
sands of them to say to themselves they
would never be like that "muslin girl."
* We are told 'that for the last eighty
y.ears Russian art-critics have worked to
establish the idea that art has a raison
d'etre only when it Is in the service of
society and "contributes toward raising
society to higher humanitarian concep
tionsâby those means which are proper
to art, and distinguish It from science."
The greatest of the Russian critics was
MlharlovÃkiy. who died last year. It la to
bÂ« noted that Kropotkin spells some of
â¢ the names of the famous Russians with
variations Trom the way In which we
have been accustomed to seeing them set
down. With Mlhallovskly, criticism '\u25a0\u25a0 took
a philosophical turn, and we are told that
the time has not yet come to fully appre
ciate hla work.
Kropotkin speaks very highly of the
richness of the Russian language, it hav
ing many more equivalents for a given
Idea than the languages of Western Eu
rope, and by these the varied shades of
meaning may be given. It has especial
wealth for expressing human feeling
tenderness and love, sadness and merri
ment; and no other language equals It in
it* power to take into itself the beauties
of foreign authors by translation. Owing
to its wonderful musical character foreign
poetry can b* rendered into it In the came
meters of the original. Nearly eighty
millions of people speak this superior Rus
sian language, (the Great-Russian), anil
there are some fifteen millions who speak
the Little-Russian, which Is- a patois.
- Perhaps to make a selection of one of
the main features that run through - all
this beautiful study of Russian litera
ture the choice of mention should fall
upon the perfection of Its realismâ realism
in its higher forms as distinguished from
that narrowed type of- realism \u25a0 which
gives offense to the taste of many, - and
which; might be called ZolalBm; and the
progress of this realism up to its union j
with Idealism, the Idealistic-realism, I
which has made the success of Maxim '
Gorkiy. !
It was the Russian poet, Pushkin, who
introduced, this realism. It was that I
realism, understood in its best sense, and *
which Kropotkin gays afterward became
characteristic of the whole of Russian
literature. â¢ Speaking of this lyric poet,
the author says that his verses are so
easy that â¢ after having , read them twice
or thrice one knows tbera. by: heart, and j
.that they pleased such refined end.phil-j
osophical poets as Turgueneff, and are the i
delight of millions of peasant children
His writings are full of the bright love of
life 3nd- respect forewomen.. He had a
power 'of poetical but of the
things ' of -everyday,- life . which ; only Tol
stoy has. to the- same extent. '"'"'-* -

iecii;r. I ulied StaiÂ«s Weather Uureau. for the
\u25a0U'ashington Crop Bulletin, week ended May
Â£3, Ik as follows:
The wÂ«-k wÂ«.s one of unusually cool weather,
with frequent and copious rains, except tn.thft
middle counties, where they were lighter and
Ipss irequeni. The temperatuie each. day was
about 5 d*ereei below normal, and there were
hfrÂ«vy rrosu. on the 17th and 16th In several
districts.
Tl.e lain will probably be very beneficial
to grain ef all kinds later on. ss it will make
an Abundant store of moisture in the soil when
the weather becomes dry and warm. But the
cool tvtather. with lack of tunehlne. has
greatly i*mrded the growth of all crops, ex
cept, perhaps, wheat and oats. Gardens are
particularly backward. The heavy frosta Sn
jurni milt, euch as cherrleÂ«. apples, etc.,
nipptd field and garden vegetables and cut
down -wheat snd barley on low valley lands.
On the high lands there was no Injury to
wnfat. The spring wheat will recover, but
the frosted winter wheat is too far advanced
to recoxer so ac to make grain. However, the
proportion of winter wheat In the district*
where the injury occurred was relatively email.
For the most part both â¢ winter and spr.ng
wheat, &s well as oats and barley, while not
growing fast at present, are In very promising
condition and will make rapid progress w.th
the first warm weather. Hops are doing well.
There were nonif high winds in the eastern
counties, doing same damage to orchard*. In
the southern counties- haying and strawberry
picking have begun.

Our market opened strong under th*sÂ« cables
and maintained a fttady tone throughout :hz
trsylnn While we do cot Me anything In 'h?
eUuat on llk*ly to break the maikct
to auy extent. It should be rcmim
bered that we have had a good advance

The dominating factor will, however, probably
b.- acreage and crop condition report soon to
be Issued. We would rather sell than buy
cotton. Too many bulls now; people are buy
ing It for long account at this prici who were
veiling it at 7c. This Is against the market.

Special- Dispatch to The Call.
The Marshall Hall prize, given every
five years by the society for the most
brilliant discovery on the nervous sys
ttm. has been awarded to Dr. Head.,
The address excited much interest and
was described by eminent authorities
present as marking a new epoch in one's
knowledge of nerves.
In an address on the' new aspect of the
censory nerves delivered to the Royal
Medical and Chirurgical Society Dr. Head
said he had the censory nerves in his
own arm divided and watched the vari
ous sensations disappear. The nerves
were then reunited by stitching and the
process of recovers' carefully watched
day by day.
As a resnlt he discovered that there are
two entirely distinct sets of nerves to* the
skin, carrying: different . kinds of 'sensa
tions. The first tet conveys ' sensations
of pain, heat and cold; the second sot
carries sensations of touch - and enables
one to localize the sensations accurately.
The healing: power of the skin depends
entirely upon the first set.
LONDON'fbMay 27.â An Interesting" dis
covery In regard to the ner\-ous system
has been made by Dr. Head, a fellow of
the Royal Society, as a result of experi
ments carried out upon himself.
The day before Church left he stole a
1850 diamond ring: from a highbinder
who Is under sentence of death, but
whose case has " been' appealed/ "He
pawned it here for $80 and- the officers
recovered it from a* pawnshop. He also
confessed the Â» theft; of a $100 ' watch
from another prisoner. * -He sold v the
watch, but the officers have located It- r
Church will be returned to San Fran
cisco, leaving here at" B o'clock and ar
riving: there at 1 0 : 4 5 \u25a0 p.s m; â¢ ~
Church's- confession is carefully
guarded by the officers here and .the
full scope of Iticannot be learned, but in
substance he toldof hayihg paid $4000
for an^ opportunity ,to escape. He had
servedjejghteenr.'nitthths^of. a two years'
sentence -forSlafceny ; and. was heacr
trusty^at- the County. Jail. In some
manner? he learned where ; $4OOO out of
the proceeds 'of a $15,000 robbery in' a
real estate concern . was \u0084 to be \ had.
Eleven, thousand dollars was recovered,
but he says' few people knew what be
came of , the remainder," and it was this
money with which he declares 'he
bought his freedom. \u25a0
.Three Jail officials were in the deal
and he has given their names. ; Two of
them took- him to a dentist's offlce:and
there gave^hlm an opportunity to es
cape. The alarmwas not given until he
had time to get out of the city. He says
the money was paid the same day.\^r /Â»
This was the declaration made ' .by-
Maurice Church, an ; escaped', prisoner
from the San >Francisco County Jail,

is a young man now receiving a
salary of $6000. a year who a few. years
ago was a bootblack Â» in this city. '.His
rise is due to .his own desire for knowl
edge and to the interest taken in him
by a member of the Yale faculty.
The opening scene occurred near the
union station in this city. 'The professor
was frying -to kill time, while waiting for
a New 5 Haven train. -He . observed / a
bright-looking' Italian boy with' -a shiae
box- clung across his ' arm seated' on "the
station step earnestly poring over a book.
After a few minutes he approached. the
youngster and. asked him if he would like
to shine his boots. The bootblack went
to work vigorously, placing, the book on
the ground close by. where he gave it an
occasional sharp \u25a0 look while shining with
vigorous and skilled hands.
/The : professor ', noted '- his < alertness and
asked what book it was that, proved so
interesting, expecting to hear that It was
a thrilling story, of, "Old Sleuth" or â¢ome
thlng of that ;. sort. He was surprised
when ; the ) shiner ; replied with " unconcern
that it waa an algebra/ ;
'"So you're studying algebra, are you?*,*
eald the ' professor.".' --
ASK AIO OF PROFESSOR.
J'Yes;, sir,- and I'm % stuck. .Do you know
anything about algebra V responded the
youth, both sentences in the same breath.
. : Now this prof es3or * was one of the no
table mathematicians of Yale and it
'sounded queer in- hia ears to be asked if
he knew anything about algebra.
; '.'Well I , know? a litq* about \ it. Whafa
the .-\u25a0 matter? X, Perhaps ,1 can - help * you.'* .

PARIS, May Si â The naval situation
in the Far East has been discussed be
tween French and American naval:of
ficers, Including admirals who took part
in the Spanish war. | Both the. French
and Americans took the view that- the
Japanese would permit the Russian
fleet to enter Vladivostok, which would
thereafter. become a repetition of the
naval situation at Santiago and Port
Arthur.
; A \u25a0 French officer said that it was.
characteristic of Russian sailors to seek
the support of land fortifications, where
they adopt the defensive, making sorties
under cover of the guns of the forts in
stead of adopting open sea tactics". On
the other hand, it was pointed out that
the Japanese had everything to 'gain in
permitting, the Russians to enter Vlad
ivostok Instead of taking chances of a
sea fight Once inside Vladivostok, the
Itussians would require coal' and .pro
visions, and it would be impossible to
secure these, as Field Marshal Oyaraa
would cut the land communications and
Admiral Togo would merchant
vessels from carrying supplies, to Vlad
ivostok. This would present much the
same situation as at Santiago and Port
Arthur, with | the 'Russians keeping un
der the shore defenses and the Japanese
maintaining . a blockade . outside and
trying to obstruct* the channels.

the advisability of accepting an., open

The correspondent, of the Associated
Press at the Russian headquarters con
firms the theory, of a change in'the'Jap
anese'plans; He*, telegraphs that:, .the;
Japanese are retiring at the slightest
pressuro'on their right * or 'center and
are, shifting eastward, seemingly., with,
General Kurokl, developing a turning
movement against General Llnevltch's
left or screening General Kawaniura's
army, which Is reported to be still far-,
ther east, presumably-; ready; to : march
on Vladivostok. The Japanese move
ments, however, apparently are await-,
ing the result of the sea fight.
TERRIFIC ELECTRIC
STORM NEAR REDDING
Â«ad torpedo-boat attacks in the shallow
waters in the straits of Formosa, but to
â¢deceive the Japanese Into the belief that
hsi objective was either the Tsugaru or
La Perouse Straits, while in reality he
changed his course and beaded for the
straits of Korea.
As a matter of fact, Rojestvensky
teems to have mystified his own Admir
alty as much as the Japanese. On one
hand, the presence of the Russian cruis
ers and colliers off Shanghai is taken as
being confirmatory of the theory that
Uojestvensky's fighting division headed
back alter circling the Island of For
mosa, and on the other the presence of
colliers and converted cruisers off
Shanghai is regarded as a blind to con
fuse the Japanese. The orders sent to
Japanese merchant vessels at Chefu to
await instructions before sailing are
considered to strengthen the former
view, indicating that Admiral Togo re
* celved information that Rojestvensky had
. altered his course and thereupon ordered
all the Japanese merchantmen to remain
in port. â¢
During the afternoon the newspapers
got out extras, which were eagerly pur
chased by the holiday crowds in the
parks and on the boulevards, and the
Admiralty was soon besieged with in
quiries for news, but the staff had none
to offer. It \u25a0was reiterated at 5 o'clock
that the Admiralty had received noth
ing beyond the news dispatches from
Tokio; that the staff here was now en
tirely dependent on the Japanese ad
vices and expect nothing from its own
sources until Admiral Rojestvensky
reaches Vladivostok. There was no
concealment of the pleasure, however,
with which the officers read the state
ment from Tokio that Rojestvensky
was off the Tsu Islands. An officer of
the staff said:
"Rojestvensky thus far has shown
himself a master of naval strategy.
If he has succeeded in leading Togo off
on a false trail and has cleared the
straits of Korea without loss from
mines or torpedo attacks, he has done
-more than his most sanguine friends
could have hoped for. If on his arrival
off the Tsu Islands he proceededed into
action, Rojestvensky mu^t have been
the victor, but personally, I doubt
whether Togo would accept battle.
"Rojestvensky's danger is by no
means over. Togo may have withdrawn
Into the Sea of Japan ahead of Rojest
vensky, in which case the Russian fleet
has the enemy ahead and not astern.
But with open â¢water all the way to
Vladivostok, his chances "of reaching
that port have greatly increased."
TOKIO EXPECTS VICTORY.
Confident That Togo Will Easily Dis
pose of Rojestvenaky.
TOKIO. May 27.â A1l Tokio is eagerly
awaiting advices of an engagement be
tween the naval forces of Admiral Togo
and Rear Admiral Rojestvcnsky. It is
believed that the fleet of Russian ves
sels seen at Saddle Islands comprised
the main fighting strength of Rear Ad
miral Rojestven sky's forces, and that
after coaling there the Russians brave
ly headed for the Tsu Islands, electing
to give battle in the event of meeting
the warships under command of the
Japanese admiral.
The fact that Rear Admiral Rojest
vensky appears to have used the For
mosan channel has created surprise, as
it was generally expected that he
woulfl pursue a course eastward of
Formosa. This increases the belief that
the Russians are anxious to -give bat
tle.
It is rumored that the Russian fleet
divided into two squadrons as it "ap
proached the Korean channel to-day.
The Navy Department refrains from
confirming or denying any of the score
of reports circulating through the capi
tal to-day and has promised to advise
the public in good time of any develop
ments. >; /-
The people have received the news of
the prospective fight with elation, so
great is their confidence In the prowess
of Admiral Togo. While it is thought
that a portion of the Russian fleet Is
certain' to reach Vladivostok, yet it Is

LepineÂ» Prefect of Pojice, says he has
a place : selected, 'but he will not

is the fact that President Loubet re
cently pardoned two. men condemned to
death for murder. The five stones
marking the place where the guillotine
formerly was operated on the square

dences of Cromwell's v wrath, : form v a
rough quadrangle '\u25a0- overgrown '- with ; Ivy
which will serve as a background for the

Thomas Dolan, president of 'the* com

to the presidents of the select and com
xacn branches of the City Council with
drawing his r'opoEiiSon to advance the
city Jio.OOO.CM in consideration fcf the ex

now holds. This action was taken after
a protracted conference with Commis
sioner Durham, Slate Senator McNicnol
end Select Councilman Charles Seger,
vho presented the gas lease resolutions
in the Councils.
; .: The withdram-al of the United Gas Im
provement Company's offer is undoubt
edly a signal victory for Mayor Weaver
in his fight against the "organization."
though it does not mean the end of the
tattle. Tfce injunction proceedings
brought by David Smythe. former Di
rector of Public Safety, and Peter E.
Costello, former Director of Public
Works, against Mayor Weaver and their
successors. Colonel Sheldon Potter and
A. Lincoln Acker, to restrain the Mayor's
appointees from conducting the affairs of
the two departments is still to come up
for argument, and the leaders will make
a determined effort to have the tempor
ary injunction made â¢ permanent. The
temporary injunction issued by the Com
mon Pleas Court was rendered inopera
tive by a \u25a0writ of supersedeas procured
by the Mayor's counsel from the Su
preme Court. Chief. Justice Mitchell of
the higher court has. however, sent the
case back to the lower court for argu
ment, and the supersedeas Is in effect
only until the question of the injunction
â¢ has been decided by that tribunal.
,[â¢;'.' In answer to questions Durham, leader
ef the organization, said:
"We have no statements whatever to.
. make in regard to the withdrawal of the
iicw gas lease of the United Gas Im
provement Company."
The leaders left for Atlantic City to
nlgTit and a conference will be held there
to consider plans for future moves.
Mayor Weaver said to-day:
"I consider this a great triumph for the
' prople. I have not yet considered how
it will affect local or State politics. I
may add that I have not yet considered
whether the fisht will be continued or
col"
It was announced by the Judge of the
Common Pleas Court that the hearing
of the injunction proceedings i would be
postponed from Monday until Wednesday
on account of the death of Justice Deane
of the State Supreme Court.
General satisfaction was expressed
throughout the x . city when it became .
j " known that \u25a0 the gas lease offer had been
withdrawn. . Mass-meetings which had
been arranged In many wards to protest '
against the lease were largely attended,
and the Mayor's victory Â«'&s the subject
of all the addresses.

th<s,"Con*y Island of the West," was
formally opened â¢ to-day to crowds of
people that filled, the streets for blocks
in every direction" from the entrance.
The White City, in appearance, Is not
unlike the World's Fair at Chicago In
so far as the architecture and color of
the buildings are concerned. It "is 'a
pleasure resort, combining the at
tractive features that were seen on the
Midway during the World's Fair at
Chicago and of the Pike at St. Louis.
Located on the South Side about a mile
west of the old World's Fair grounds,
the White City occupies about- twenty
acres, fllled with, buildings all painted
white ;ahd of ; permanent construction.
The buildings cost something ; more
than a million dollars, and will; in the
future, be an attraction every: summer.
While not as large as the Worlds- Fair,
the White City will â¢ accommodate from
25,000 to 40,000' people - daily and will
be open to the public : daily' and Â» at
night, including Sundays. " > 1

BERLIN,. May 27.â Foreigners again
captured the honors of this year's music
eeason in Berlin. Among the artists who
won special distinction were two- girls,
one American and one French, each nine
teen years oldâ Miss Myrtle Elvyn of
Chicago and Mademoiselle Germalne
Scbnitzer of Paris, both of whom will
shortly be heard as concert soloists In
the United States. Miss Elvyn. who is a
native of Texas, was a "child wonder"
pianist developed by Carl Wolfsohn of
Chicago, who has spent the past three
years in Berlin perfecting her technique
under the guidance of Leopold Godowsky,
the Russian virtuoso, who is proud of
his American citizenship and long 'resi
dence in the United States. Miss Elvyn.
who is an exceptionally pretty girl of the
tyjjical American blonde type, has just
Completed a tour of Belgium and Holland,
and her debut in Berlin last December
won warm praise from Berlin's exacting
critics. She also played with great suc
cess before the venerable Grand Duke of
Baden.
Mademoiselle Schnitzer was also a pian
ist "child wonder" in France at the pre
cocious age of ilx. At seven she was
transposing Bach's fugues and preludes
so brilliantly that she attracted the in
terest of Raoul Pugno. who asked her
parents to be permitted to develop the
little woman at the Paris Conservatory
until she was ready for her artistic ca
reer. Her first year under Pugno resulted
In her winning the gold medal of her
class. Emil Saner then sought the privi
lege of entering Mademoiselle at his
school in Vienna and she studied with
him for several years after leaving Pug
no. Her premiere with the Philharmonic
Orchestra in Berlin in February of this
year captured the local critics, who pre
dict for her a brilliant future. Pugno
made a special trip to Berlin to be present
at his former protege's debut

FINGERS CUT OFF.â It. C. Edwards, a
cabinet-maker of 1136 Howard street, was in
jured yesterday by a riveting machine cutting
the fingers off his left hand. He was. treated
at the Emergency Hospital.
When the flat had been plundered to
their satisfaction the men rushed- out
of . the building and disappeared down
the street. Mrs. : Lease gave the police
a good description of the robbers, but
they have not yet been found.
;-*Now, you've grot some moneyv- and
you've got. to, show me. where it is,"
said one of the desperadoes. "It must
be in that bag you had when you came
In. Show me where you put it No
funny business now.", ' .';,
With the revolver at the back of her
head, Mrs. Lease led him to her bed
room and pointed out her shopping: bag.
The burglar opened it, took the roll of
bills and then marched her back to the
hall, where he detained her : with his
revolver until the other robber had fin
ished with the silver and other things
in the flat.
Through the door of her flat she saw
the other robber packing away her sil
ver and such bric-a-brac as he took a
fancy to.
NEW YORK, May 27.â Mrs. Mary Ellen
Lease, the lecturer and former Populist
leader, was the victim of a daring rob-;
bery in her home in this city last night
While one robber held a revolver with
the muzzle " pressing . close | against her
temple and admonished her not to make
an outcry: another searched her â¢; flat,!
gathering up valuables of every ' descrip-.^
tion, and finished by taking a j diamond
pin which she wore at her throat. ; A roll
of bank notes amounting to ' $110, which
Mrs. Lease had just drawn ' from ': the
bank, also was found by the robbers and
carried away by them. The total ; value"
of the booty, they secured is placed' at
$500.:. .. :\u25a0 ;;.:'\u25a0-. \u25a0/ : ; ; \u25a0;. , \u25a0,\u25a0';;\u25a0.,-.-
Mrs. Lease was reading in her sitting-,
room when she * heard footsteps !In
private | hall outside and went to investi
gate." As she stepped acress the threshold
a short, stockily-built man -seized her by
the throat and forcing her against the
wall placed the ' muzzle of a revolver
against her temple. â¢\u25a0
"Not a word," he said, and the order
was obeyed. '
"I "don't want to shed any blood," con
tinued the thug, "and I won't if you will
be serislble and keep. quiet. My pal is go
ing through your flat. That diamond
studded breastpin of yours looks pretty
good and I guess I will take it."
Mrs. Lease handed it over without
even a word of protest.
After desultory resistance .to t depres
sion stocks; made a brisk midweek: reÂ«
covery, and then drifted downward oh
the disappointing, response from .buy
ers at the recovered level of . prices. Re
ports of restored ; harmony In the Norths
western | railroad field gave the | impulse
to the recovery and that subject -has
played- a large part in forming senti
ment, toward the market throughout.
It was believed that the threatened
trouble in that field lay at 'Â« the I bottom
of athe pressure : upon' the market^and
the 'announcement that : trouble 'had
been ; averted . caused a corresponding
degree of; alarm among the considerble
uncovered short interest. .

events' has been to bring home to the
financial public for the first; time the

Blood made pure. Good health naturally
follows. . .

For one so untrained he has a wonder
ful mastery of technique. In his oratorio
to which ' his father has given the title
of "Exaltation" there are tremendous
moving chords and stirring progressions
and florid runs. . But It has no story or
gradually developed theme. It is a series
of musical numbers . set to the grand
words of prophet and psalmist.
It was something, he 1 supposed, that
had some connection with on angel and
a bell, and going to church. When its
meaning was explained to him he realized
at once how much more he might have
made of his theme had he only known.
He Is a pale-faced boy, rather shy and a
little deaf, and there Is nothing remark
able about his appearance. He Is one of
a family of six; his father is a drummer
and his mother a Scotch woman. Neither
cf them is particularly musical. But the
boy took to music like a duck does to
\u25a0water. His parents are far from being
\u25a0well off. They could not afford to do
more for him than engage a local teacher
in the little town where they live to give
the boy some pianoforte lessons. For the
rest they turned him loose on a piano.
He got hold of a copy of Prout's
"Harmony" and with the aid of that
somewhat antiquated authority taught
himself all that he knows of harmony
and composition. It is natural that his
efforts so far should exhibit something
of the limitations of his guide.
One of his compositions he terms
"Angelus." It Is a pretty little piece,
in which the insistent note of a bell
sounds through some graceful and
pleasant melody, as of happy crowds
g-olng to church. But a visitor found
that he had no definite Idea of the
meanincr of "Angelus."
LONDON^ May 27.â One can count with
something like certainty on a fpesh musi
cal prodigy turning up every few weeks.
The latest is George Williams, a 14-year
jold schoolboy, who has made a bid for
early fame by composing an oratorioâ a
biff one of fifty numbers, with choruses,
solos, duets and even double choruses
with eight part accompanimentsâ in nine
teen days. But the thing that gives
George a somewhat unique claim to dis
tinction among precocious musicians Is
the fact that he is almost entirely self
taught. Considering what be has achieved
with the scantiest of training, there is
good reason for believing that if taken
in hand and given tha best Instruction
and proper environment he may make his
mark as a composer.

is another question.
.. :"I . think that a cable . lineâ that; is,
the roadbed and rails-^-could' be'eon
verted much cheaper to the conduit
system than to the trolley system. But
then one must take into consideration
the expense of changing the cars from
grip cars to motors. v
"You say that your road ' on Sutter
street is a . cable road for partofits
length. The car proposition .would be
a serious one . for the company if the
road were converted, but if new cars
have to be provided for the cable as it
now is it would not cost any more-for
a conduit car than for a trolley or a
cable car. The question of decision
would be Involved in the reconstruction'
and whether this would pay or not; I
would not be able to Judge unless I
were in a position- to know the per
centage of .business carried by the cars
and the proportions of its fluctuations.
"Here in Washington we operate
systems radiating from the center, of
the city in all directions. All of these
lines are conduit, lines and they are,
highly satisfactory. However, our. city,
is much smaller , than San Francisco
and, as "visitors here know, we switch
from the conduit . to the trolley : in
suburban extensions, or transfer to
trolleys that traverse the -less thickly,
settled parts of the city.
"I don't see how water could; inter
fere with the operation of a conduit
road, unless the drainage of the street!
and the sewerage maintained at a city's
expense were bad. - We have no trouble
to speak of during snow storms and
our grades here are not heavy. Per
sonally, I believe that a conduit car
could go anywhere a trolley can \u25a0climb.
A sudden rush of water in a conduit on
a steep grade might cause ia^losg "of
power by induction and if ; rains : were
apt to. continue in a downpour; it might
Interfere with traffic. Concerning,' this
I am not posted sufficiently to offer an
opinion." -
"I understand that In Ban Francisco
your street lines run a full 'city
length' in most cases; that is, the roads
start from a given pomt < and. traverse
the town in a certain direction for. its
entire length or breadth. A general
system of the. conduit order would re
quire in such a "city -as San Francisco,
I should imagine, a tremendou* outlay
of money, as the line* v,-ould have. to
be rebuilt. But if a cable road exists
where the conduit is desired, then that
WOULD REQUIRE BIG OUTLAY.
Officials of the street roads of Wash
ington, Chicago and New York: are
naturally averse to discussing the mer
its or demerits of roads in other cities,
a feeling of professional courtesy, so to
speak, prevailing among them." But
they admit that the conduit road when
once built is if anything a little cheaper
to operate than the trolley.
"In suburban sections," said a Wash
ington street railroad man, "we have
found that it would require a great
many years of patronage receipts to
pay interest on the large Investments
required to build very long conduit
lines.
The officers of the Washington cor
poration say that the conduit gives lit
tle or .no trouble. It is . as. cheap a,
means of operation as the trolley and
practically eliminates all danger of
falling wires, carrying with them
death-dealing currents of electricity.
This means a minimum of lawsuits.
The roads, however, are said to be con
siderably more expensive to construct,
as they include not only the ordinary
work required in the; laying; of such
trackage as street lines require but the
conduit itself Involves an expenditure
that greatly adds to the capital in
vested.
There are no trolley railroads In the
city of Washington proper. 'but there
are miles of well-built street line* that
more Â«wiftly and comfortably over
level ground and grades alike and
which are entirely free from break
downs.
WASHINGTON, D. C, May 27.â After
careful Inquiry of the officials of thÂ«
Capital Traction Company, the "street
corporation that controls and operates
all of the principal street' railroads of
this city, not only" will one como to.the
conclusion that the building of the Sut
ter-strÂ«et railroad or Geary-street rail
road on the conduit plan Is desirable
but they will wonder how a corporation
would care to operate any other sort of
road except in suburban districts. The
application of the conduit to the Mar
ket-street system of San- Francisco
would be feasible, it is said, except/ in
sections where the grade is too steep
for other than cable service.

President P. H. McCarthy of the
Building Trades Council, who has
Just returned- from Chicago, is
of the opinion .that the strike
there will be a prolonged one and may
eventually extend beyond- the city of
Chicago. He. was somewhat surprised
on learning that the Building Trades
Council there ' refused to ' Join hands in
the strife, as all trades unions are more
or less affected by a strike when it en
tails the hauling business of building
material. %
President Richard Cornelius of the
Street Carmen's Union, , who had been
in Petaluma organizing the carmen in
that town, returned yesterday. Other

A Scotch fish expert who Investigated
the herring fishery off the Nova Scotia
coast last summer and who afterward
\u25a0went to the Pacific Coast to inquire Into
the herring industry there, reports that
the Pacific herring, in the main, are con
eiderably smaller, but contain far more
oil than the Atlantic herring; that they
are adapted to a class of kippers to be
used within a limited time, but are not
so suitable to pickle in barrels to com
pete v.-lth the best Scotch or Norwegian
s-pecies; and that they will not keep so
long nor in as good condition as the At
lantic herring p and therefore could not
compete with the properly cured article
from the Atlantic. It is thought that a
good market could be secured for Pacific
pickled herring in China, Australia and
the Straits Settlements, as well as in the
Western States. A lot or the Pacific her
rinp was put up in barrels similar to the
best Scotch brands and cold well; but as
the best salt was not used. It is supposed
that the quality of the pickled article
could be improved. The markets men
tioned would also provide an outlet for
dry-salted Pacific herring. It Is recom
mended that after the experiment In At
lantic waters is completed next fall, half
of the etaft* of the Scotch expert curers
be sent to the Pacific Coast to put up
some herring in the best Scotch method
end give instruction to persons desiring to
learn It.â Baltimore American.

There were numerous fights between the
police and strike sympathizers in all
parts of the city to-day, the majority of
the scrimmages being, however, in the
lumber district.
In nne of the riots in this section a
large number of women and children
made much trouble, for the police, by
getting In front of 'them when they
charged upon the men who had been,
hurling missiles. One woman, Mrs. Anna
Corcoran, was arrested as she stood with
an armful of brickbats hurling them as
fast as she could at the police. One of
them struck Policeman i Christopher
Dressier on the head, knocking off his
helmet. He mad,e a rush for the woman
and placed her in the patrol wagon-
Police Inspector Lavin to-day arrested
Nicholas Relchart, James Collins, JoKn
H. Doherty and a man named WaTil,
who declined to give his first name, b"Ut
Is known as "Shoulders," on the charge
of conspiring ; to slug W. F. Johnson of
the Wells Fargo Company and W. E.
Ellis, superintendent of the city delivery
department of the same company. Reich
art, after being taken into custody, con
fessed his share in the matter and : Kls
statements led to the arrest of other
three.
All denied that they^had >een paid to
do the slugging.
The general opinion regarding the visit
of Barry is that he has gone east for the
purpose of securing financial aid for his
men. It Is admitted by the labor leaders
that a critical stage in the strike Is at
hand.
The offer was accepted by the teamsters
and acknowledged by the employers, \u25a0as
all other similar propositions have been,
with the declaration that there was noth
ing in the strike that admitted of arbi
tration. The labor leaders made another
effort to induce Vice President Fairbanks
to use his good offices in settling the
strike, and a number of the Team Own
ers' Association members Joined them In
the move. They were informed by the
secretary of the vice president, however,
that he could not undertake to interfere
In the matter.
Levy Mayer, attorney for the Employ
ers' Association, and James B. Barry,
business agent of the Express Drivers'
Union, both left Chicago for the East to
day. Neither man would state the object
of his Journey. It \ was reported that
Mayer was to confer with the officials of
the express companies in an effort to in
duce them to modify their stand against
the re-employment of their striking driv
ers, but he denied this and declared that
he knew that the .companies would not
recede "from the position they had taken.
1,1 was said of Barry's object in going to
New York that he was planning to call
out the express drivers in other cities on
a sympathetic strike unless the Chicago
drivers are reinstated.
President Mulligan of the expreES driv
ers said: "I would not care to talk about
the report. I have heard of euch a thing
as an effort to call out the drivers in other
cities. I understand that the drivers are
well organized In Boston, but I do not
know what is the situation in New York."
RIOTING CONTINUES.
Several new efforts were made during
the" day to settle the strike, but, nonÂ« of
them amounted to anything. The Chicago
â¢Team Owners' Association made another
effort to Induce the teamsters to arbitrate
the Question of delivering goods to boy
cotted houses. The Chicago Masons, and
Builders' Association offered its services
to arbitrate ail things connected? with the
strike.
NOTHIXG TO ARBITRATE.
CHICAGO, May 27.â While numerous
small riots were in progress to-day, both
in the downtown streets and in the lum
ber districts, the leaders of the team
sters 1 strike and the officials of the
building trades were engaged in quarrels
of their own.
The action of -the building trades last
night in withdrawing from the teamsters
theff financial aid and moral support an
gered the teamsters, and they lost no
time to-day In calling upon the repre
sentatives of the building trades and de
manding to know what they meant "by
going back" on the teamsters in the
thick of the fight. Then it was made
plain to the teamsters that in the opinion
of the building trades they had over
stepped . 'their jurisdiction in causing
members of their union to do construc
tive work.
The particular cause of complaint was
that teamsters .employed in handling
safes and vaults had placed them in
buildings. This part of the work, the
building trades contend, belongs to them.
President Shea of the Teamsters' Union
declared that ha would.. order yjut every
safe-mover and machinery rigger in the
city on Monday morning and stop 'work
on all buildings where the members of
the building trades are employed. No
attention was paid to this threat by Â£ie
buildings trades representatives, and
finally a committee, composed of Michael
Casey of San Francisco, John Sheridan
of Chicago' and Edward Gould of New
York, all members of the executive coun
cil of the teamsters, was appointed to
confer with the building trades over the
matter of jurisdiction. No time was
specified for the meeting.
It is proposed to form an anti-joint
ure Statehood league, with sub-leagues
for each county In the Territory. The
central committees of both political
parties at meetings held this morning
decided on harmonious antl-jolnture
action.

KOBS HIS KMPLOYER.
OAKLAND. May 27.â Albert Llddell.
employed as a ealesman by G. M. Leav
itt, the proprietor of the Oakland Paper
Company, was arrested last night by
Detective George Kyte on a charge of
felony embezzlement preferred by his
* ;nployer. Leavitt charges that Llddell
has misappropriated several hundred
dollars of the firm's money. Llddell ad
mits his guilt, but it is thought that
his relatives will make good the short
age and that the young man will es
cape prosecution. The salesman says
he lost the stolen money In gambling.
He is but 22 years of age, but is mar
ried and has two small children.
As the votes stand, Naylor was just
crowded out by Boehmer, whose elec
tion he is now contesting 1 , and he asks
the courts to unseat Boehmer, contend
ing that the party name was not right
fully on the ballot and that people were
deceived and misled by the name to
vote for men who represented no more
than a half dozen politicians.
The candidates for this office and
their votes as set forth were: Repub
licans â William J. Gorham, 977; Charles
E. Naylor, 827, and Ernest J. J. Probst,
P22; Socialistsâ R. A. Daque, 246; H. C.
Robinson, 172; S. Miller, 187; Taxpay
ers' Non-Partlsan party â Arthur P.
Tarpey, SO9; H. G. Mertens, 455. and
Fritz Boehmer. S3l.
According to this complaint. Timothy
G. Daniels. A. F. St. Sure, Charles C.
Tlsdale. T. C. Stoddard, A. B. Tarpey,
Fritz Eoehmer and IL C. Mertens are
responsible for the "Taxpayers' Non-
Partlsan party," and they represented
no one ljut a "job." Through their ef
forts Boehmer was elected to office,
though Naylor claims the votes should
not have been counted for him.
OAKLAND. May 27.â Alleging that
the party designated as the "Taxpayers'
Non-Partisan party." which put a list
of candidates In the field at the recent
municipal election held In Alameda,
consisted of a small coterie of politi
cians. Charles E. Naylor has brought
an action to contest the election of
Fritz Boehmer as a Trustee on the
grround that the party never cast 3
per cent of the votes at any election
and was not entitled to have its name
placed at the head of a column on the
ticket.
In connection with the Nevada work Is
a new feature, just undertaken under En
gineer Means' ' direction. Leslie M.Simms
of San Francisco has been detailed by
the Bureau of Forestry to select In Ne
vada the most unpromising bit of : laud
he can find and then to send samples of
the soil to Engineer \u25a0 Means for analysis.
Then Engineer Means will advise regard
ing the proper method of Its irrigation.
In Oregon is what Is called the Kla
math project,:this Including the draining
The dam' is at Hazen arid is almost
completed, as is also the last reservoir
site on the lower part of the - Carson
River. The cement for this work has
been made at the Sulsun mills and tested
by E.W. Huber, one of the staff , asso
ciated with Engineer Means. It is In
tended-to construct about 225 lateral irri
gation and drainage ditches in this Ne
vada district.
GREAT WORK IN NEVADA.
Their station at the University of Cali
fornia is the only one in the United
States. It is unique. In the station are
received samples of soil Intended to be
reclaimed, samples of the water to be
used for irrigation, samples of the silt
in the streams from which irrigating
waters are to be taken, and all these
samples are analyzed to determine what
action shall be taken in carrying on the
irrigation projects.
The agricultural value of the soil which
it is proposed to reclaim is tested by En
gineer Means. The character of the water
is determined, . co that the amount re
quired for irrigation may be .. known.
The constituents of the silt In the river
beds are found out, so that It may be de
cided, whether the silt, for example,
would fill up a reservoir* where irrigation
water might be 6tored, or whether the
Eilt would be injurious ' or beneficial " to
land on which it might be taken. There
are now samples of silt from forty rivers
In the West, all of which are being test
ed to determine the chemical value of
each. Its plant-sustaining . qualities ' and
the amount of alkali it contains.
The reclamation work, which has its
authority In the Government, and , for
Engineer Means its chemical authority,
is intended to make the deserts of the
West blossom as the rose. I On this coast
there are three separate projects now
under way or under considerationâ the
Imperial, Klamath and Sacramento Val
ley projects. . _
The Government workmen have about
completed the work at the Truckee River
that is intended to dam that stream
and turn loose its waters upon the Car
son sink district in Nevada. One of the
results of this single undertaking will be
the reclamation of many thousands oÂ£
acres of land that Is now worthless. It
is expected that the land when under ir
rigation will represent a value of several
million dollars. ..\u25a0^\u25a0--.;.?
BERKELEY, May. 27.â "Worn out by his
excessive and exhausting: labors In i con
nection with the \ United States Govern
ment's great reclamation projects In the
"West, Thomas H. . Means, the young en
gineer of soils of the United States Geo
logical Survey, who Is In charge of the
station at the University of California,
has left for Southern California, hoping
to recuperate in that cllmate^and then to
begin again the task set hlnvby the Gov
ernment at Washingtonâ a task so vast
In its scope and far-reaching in its possi
bilities that it is perhaps without paral
lel in the country's history of big things
undertaken by young Americans.
Means has established in the chemistry
building on the university campus a
laboratory fully equipped with modern
appliances for the task he and his staff
are pÂ«rformlng:, and there his men toil
night and day solving the problems in
conectlon with the reclamation projects
being undertaken throughout the West.
Despite the great importance of the
work and of Mr. Means' part In It, the
young Government engineer has attract
ed little or no attention at the univer
sity, co that he is practically unknown
locally, while all the time In Washington
his work is being watched with the deep
est Interest. â¢
Engineer Means has for his chief as
sistant C. H. Stone, an expert water
analyst. These two men pass upon every
feature of every Government Irrigation
project, from the Mississippi to the coast
ana from Montana to the gulf, before
any move is made by the field forces sent
out from Washington.

A peculiar climatic feature exists In the
southern part of the Congo Valley for
10 degrees south of the equator. The
rivers and lakes are found to be bor
dered with a dense vegetation, which ex
tends out from* the water a distance pro
portioned to, the extent of the water sur
face. Adjacent hills and mountains are
often covered with dense vegetation on
one side and are bare on the other. Be
yond this bordering vegetation there are
plains, almost treeless or with small scrub
growth and thin grass.
The explanation is given as follows:
From May to October there la a dry sea
son, with hot days and fairly cool nights
(often 50 degrees Fahrenheit). The evap
oration of the daytime is followed by
condensation into fog at night. This fog
moistens the country adjacent to the
water surface and causes a luxuriant
growth of vegetation. The morning winds
blow the fog against the exposed sides
of hills and mountains and up the val
leys of tributary streams. "Wherever the
fog Is not carried the country is dry.
The natives reflect this characteristic of
their; bills ' by shaving off the 'hair from
one tide of . their heads. Dense forests
are found where the fogs prevail, while
out of range of this moisture there Is only
a sparse vegetation.â Chicago Chronicle.

PAINFULLY HURT IN
RUNAWAY ACCIDENT
Up to within a. comparatively recent
period. cases of poisoning by wood
alcohol were among the rarities of
medical practice, for so Ions: as the
substance was manufactured by the
old prooesses - its offensive smell and
taste were sufficient to deter even the
most hardened drinker from usine it to
satisfy his craving for alcoholic stimu
lants. Since the. time, however, that
"deodorized" wood alcohol has been
placed on the market, under various
names, the fatalities from its use have
gone up by leaps and bounds.
Not only may. it be used in place of
grain alcohol in the manufacture and
adulteration of spirituous liquors, but
It is also largely, and widely used as a
menstruum In many toilet preparations
and remedies for internal and external
use. The reasons for this practice are
twofold. First, and that, which ao
peals most - forcibly to I human nature.
is the comparative cheapness of wood
alcohol, it being untaxed, and costinx
but fifty' cents < a gallon, while grain
alcohol, taxed, costs at retail $2 60 a
gallon. The second' reason is the igno
rance of many, manufacturers as to the
deadly nature of methyl alcohol. ' In
deed,, even among members of the
medical profession views with regard
to the poisonous nature of methyl
alcohol are widely* divergent, and some
who have had no experience in cases
of wood . alcohol poisoning are openly
skeptical concerning Its reputed -toxic
properties. In order, therefore, to de
cide the question. Dr. Frank Buller of
Montreal and Dr. â¢ Casey "Wood of
Chicago undertook in the beginning . of
1904 an investigation of the subject,
under \u25a0 the auspices of the section on
ophthalmology of the American Medi
cal Association. The investigators
found; that about 175 cases of blindness
and about 100 deaths during the last
seven or eight years could be directly
Imputed to wood alcohol in the various
forms In which it is manufactured.
This estimate Is a conservative one.
and only treats of public Instances- of
death and' blindness. *
. Drs. Buller and Wood consider that
the investigations undertaken by them
confirm the suspicions entertained by
many physicians that the fumes of
wood ~r alcohol, under certain < favorable
conditions, are a dangerous menace . to
eyesight, ' and they moreover believe
that the consensus of opinion is op
posed to the statement of the makers
of the - various forms of "deodorized"
wood alcohol that its external use in
liniments, alcohol "rubs"; in baths, in
cosmetics, hair tonics, - perfumes. . etc..
is always devoid of danger to the eye
sight.; ....
' -The; practice of substituting wood
for grain alcohol in the manufacture of
medicinal preparations would appear to
be ; a . most i insidious and * pernicious
means .; of poisoning 1 , and the sale, not
only of '.methyl whisky," but also of
Internal ; remedies - and r < toilet prepara
tions;, manufactured v or adulterated
with wood alcdhol. should be restricted
by-law.;- In fact, there is every reason
why, the proposition. of Drs. Butler and
i should*. be ; adopted that methyl
alcohol , in t any ; of .: Its forms should be
treated as a poison, and subject to the
laws â¢ of the States restricting
and I regulating : the - sale of poisons. â

, They Assist Much la the Develop
ment Of the Child's
aflmd.
Miss Elizabeth Harrison, head of the
kindergarten movement in thl3 country,
says: "Toys form a bridge between the
great realities of life and the child's
; small capacity." If this Is true, then
toys which bridge from nothing to no
where are useless.
This was the case with the playthings
of the second family of children with
whom I lived in the capacity of nursery
governess. They had no connection
either with the present state- of the chil
dren's minds or with any future stage
of development. "What possible pleasure
or profit could children of two and four
get out of a bagatelle board? They had
not the mechanical strength nor skill to
shoot the ball, still less the mental power
to count the points, and least of all any
care as to whether they won or not. They
had various mechanical toys far beyond
their power to manipulate or understand,
and some Japanese things in Jointed,bam
boo the object of which ' 1 was never
able to discover. There were no blocks,
no balls, nothing to minister to their in
stinct for construction, but their spirit
of destruction was encouraged. '
The oossesslons that seemed to please
them most were a stick with a horse's
head at one end. on which they could
pretend to ride; a little Iron wagon which
they could 'drag around, some reins with
which they could play horse and a me
chanical pi? whose : Internal organs were
a colled spring and a wheel or two. They
saw horses and wagons In the real life
around them and pigs were common ob
jects in the landscape. These toys gave
them a little world of their own suited
to - their capacity, to enjoy which they *
did not need the help of an adult.

Ijht? 3 S. F. . Had suffered : with
.'\u25a0\u25a0. \J7Â» \u25a0? stomach troubles for years,
-Eff^i. and tOT the la3t 1S months
with spasms of the 3tom-
%Â»xs}^ BxV ach. American doctors
*9mSUsM^ could do nothing; for me
but KJve mo morphine to relieve the
pain when one of the attacks came on.
Though I had been having: the spasms
every other day before taking Dr. Wong
Woo's teas, since the first week I have
had but two light \u25a0 attacks and both
these from eating improper food. I
feel I am 100 per cent better than when
I began taking his teas. One result
that Is entirely unexpected is that tho
sight has returned to my left eye. For
yearn I only saw shadows; now I can
distinguish objects quite plainly.
I also had chronic kidney and liver
troubles, with great pain and soreness
ln the back: now the distress is entirely
gone and I consider myself a well man.
I think 1 would not be alive to-day tf
I had not taken Dr. Wong Woo's treat-

woman to the City Jail and Frank M.
Egan, the woman's attorney, also went
along. Arrived at the City Jail, one of
the officers suggested tnat perhaps the
woman would like to have her clothing
brought down from the County Jail, and
a hack was called. The woman, Wap
penstein, and the Montana Sheriff got Into
the hack, leaving Lawyer Egan standing
around police headquarters waiting for
them to return. Half an hour passed
and the lawyer grew suspicious and went
to the. County^' Jail.' He found that, the

it_ dawned on mm that the woman had

ANOTHER EXPOSURE
WATERVILLE, Wash., May 27.â Nick
Brown, a miner, living just north of
town," usei^ an alarm clock to wake
himself morninrs and about daylight
yesterday he heard what, he thought
was the clock. Jumping out of bed
he beard the same sound coming ap
parently from the bed, and, turning,
he noticed the bed quilt moving.
He put on a pair of leather gloves
and made a grab at the moving quilts.
To his horror he found that he had
grabbed a large rattlesnake by the
neck. Brown held on; while the rat
tler colled around his arm. Brown
finally secured a butcher knife and cut
the snako from his arm.
The snake had fourteen rattles and a
button. Under the quilts where the
rattler lay was found a number of little
rattlesnakes. â¢

Uricsol,
the only cure for
Rheumatism. V
If you are suffering from rheuma-
tism there is a chance for you to be-
come absolutely cured. You may
cure yourself and do it quickly if you
will lay aside jour prejudice and skep-
ticism.
Every San Prancisco druggist sells
Uricsol, the well-known remedy, and
â¢we hereoy authorize them to guaran-
tee a cure.
Uricsol cures rheumatism in the
only possible way it can be cured.
Uric Acid and Urates are the cause
of Rheumatism. These are deposited
in the tissues, blood vessels and joints
of ihe body.
These deposits must be dissolved
and from the system be-
fore a cure can be accomplished.
Uricsol is a solvent cf these and
tones up the system, stimulates the
kidney-, liver and bowels ' and thus
drives them from the system.
Uric-ol is harmless, and no injuri-
ous results can possibly come to any
part of your body.
Write us to-day for bookie* con-
taining recommended diet for rheu-
matics.

get around. In ' this bad condition, she for-
tunately heard of the Electro-Chemic treat-
ment and happily tor her the treatment proved
curative from the beginning and she is now
perfectly well.
This is just one more case illustrating the
wonderfully curative effects of Electro-
chemistry ln seemingly incurable cases. It is
worth any one's time to Investigate Electro-
chemistry. Consultation and examination' ln
all cases is free. Electro-Chemistry is success-
ful ln all diseased conditions and Is especially
recommended ln consumption, catarrh, asthma,
bronchitis, deafness, ringing ears, head noises,
dizziness, cancers, tumors, ulcers, old sores,
eczema, pimples, eruptions, headache, neu-
ralgia, rheumatism, locomotor ataxia, para-
lysis, eczema, blood poison, diseases of the
stomach, liver and bowels, constipation. Indi-
gestion, piles, fistula, female diseases, such
as displacements. Irregularities, painful ovar-
lea, ln diseases of the kidneys. Bright' s dis-
ease, diabetes, inflammation of , the bladder,
special diseases of men, such as prostatitls,
nerve exhaustion, stricture and enlarged pros-
tate. The s "Electro-Chemlc home treat-
ment is very successful. Patients living at a
distance are loaned a full Electro-Chemic out-
fit for the home treatment. It is always best,
however, for such a person to come for a
personal examination -when possible. The
Electro-Cbemlc Institute, thfLonly one on the
Pacific Coast, is located at 118 Grant avenue,
corner of Post street, San Francisco. There
are separate and private apartments for the
accommodation of male and female patients,
and the office hours arf from 9 ln the morn-
Ing until 5 In the afternoon, and from 7 to 8
at night dally, and on Sundays from 10 ln the
morning: until 1 ln the afternoon.

TVrlght has been drinking steadily
since December last and was a frÂ«
queater of Clymo's saloon. Clymo had
refused to give Wright any more
drinks on Thursday and the last named
armed himself with the hatchet yester
day morning â¢when the saloon was
opened, with the intention of getting
a drink by fair means or fouL He en
tered the saloon and asked Clymo for
a drink. Clymo did not answer him,
but bent down to get the whisky bot
tle, intending to give him a drink.
Â« At that moment Wright struck Cly
mo on the back of the head with the
hatchet, knocking him unconscious.
Mrs. Clymo saw the blow struck and
raised an alarm. Wright threatened
to kill her If she did not stop crying
out and walked from the saloon, wip
ing the blood off the hatchet. He
walked In the direction of Devlsadaro
street. Policemen Mylar and Malcolm
heard Mrs. Clymo's cries for help and
she pointed to Wright as the man who
had attempted to kill her husband.
They went after Wright and placed
him under arrest.
"William Clymo, proprietor of a gro
cery and saloon at 2280 Geary street,
\ras v struck on the head with a hatchet
by Alexander Wright, 76 Garden ave
nue, yesterday morning. The blow
fractured Clymo'a skull, tout the
chances are fn favor of his recovery
unless complications set In.
Mrs. Jennie Calegari, a wife of but
four months and one of the comeliest
matrons in theNLatin, colony, met a fear
ful death yesterday. 1 In ' intense agony
she passed away at her home, 427 Union
street, from the effects of burns received
the previous evening.
Mrs. Calegari was only. 20 years old
and a native daughter of California. ' It
had been her habit to read in her room
every night before retiring, and she used
a candle, regarding it safer for that pur
pose than a coal oil lamp. I Last Friday
night at 10:30 o'clock her husband's
father, F. Calegari, the proprietor of a
bakery on the first , floor, heard . her
screaming. Knowing of her habit and
Eurmising what had happened, he 'ran
upstairs and into his daughter-in-law's
room. There he was horrified on seeing
her in the middle of the floor, her cloth
ing in flames. Hastily snatching a blank
et from the bed he wrapped her around
with it and succeeded in smothering the
flames, but not before she had been se
verely scorched. Medical assistance was
summoned at once and her husband was
notified at his placo of business,. a saloon
at 452 Union street, a few doors away,
but in spite of all that medical skill could
do the unfortunate woman passed away
yesterday afternoon after much suffer
ing.
The Coroner will hold an Inquest.
SkulMs Fractured, but the
Chances of His Recovery
Are Deemed Favorable

hastened away. Since that moment she
had been the victim of a star-spangled

SPECIAL CAE FOR STAFF
Therefor it is that a ' lot of socity wom
en, abetted by a 'few humane physicians,
have organized , the San Francisco Mater
nity Hospital, over on Harrison street,
near Ninth; where the little ones of the
poor "may {open their eyes In a world of
comfort; and what with bathing, feeding
and sanitary environment â¢ the babes are
started right and 'their mothers instruct
ed in their Intelligent care. And. incident-;
ally, a" few. ideas of sanitation and hy
giene are "absorbed -' from the white
capped nurses and the patient physicians
thereabouts, which Is not the least of the
hospital's public benefactions.
- They'll need them in the struggle for
bread Into which they have been thrust
by - parents': who are < helpless to equip
them for "the .-fray."/ A crime? Perhaps,
but a crime that- laws cannot reach.
: V > HYGIBXE IS ENCOURAGED.
Poor little ; babe, â¢ and the poor little
babes that -follow:â for they follow fast
in the haunts of the poorâ it Is but small
compensation for. the unasked gift of life
to start. them aright In the world, with a
clean . skin, a pair of healthy eyes and
, well-nourished body.
""â¢Ask :any - physician of your acquaint
ance what he deems the . most ' distressing
conditions he encounters la. his .practice
among the" poorâ the I pitifully, poorâ and
he will tell you that It is not, the presence
of tuberculosis . nor of pneumonia - nor of
the ''rickets/* the "scourge of; the New
York , tenements. ; but * the 1 baby question
that stumps himâ the -lack of preparation
f or : the â¢ little stranger's coming, the lack
.of - common comforts for the mother, the
ignorance of the" needs 'of the little one.
"And sometimes, not r bf ten. is there lndif
\u25a0f erence j to " its wants, particularly when
the . babe . is an - unwelcome guest, adding
to an already burdensome brood. Just as
if ' the little pink mite had aught to do
with its advent. '"

The harsh weather of the last week
has added to the" training troubles of
Young' Corbett.' He is -working as if
his life depended on his efforts, and the
flesh is yielding gradually. He vowed
he would not retire last night until
he touched the 135-pound mark.
To do this he went on the road three
times â in the morning, afternoon and
evening. Each time he was bundled
up until he took on the physique of
Tom Sharkey. The extra clothing la
not necessary on the outward Journey,
but when he turns toward home the
piercing wind from the ocean undoes all
the good of the early part of his run.
He was sadly discouraged on Friday,
when, after putting, in a tremendous
day's work, he found he had actually
gained two pounds. He weighed 136
pounds in the morning and 133 in the
evening.
He has cut down his allowance of
food, sleep and liquids, and seems sure
he will be at weight on "Wednesday. As
showing the remarkable power of.ab
sorption possessed by his system, Cor
bett says that whi*o he will weigh but
130 pounds on Friday night, he will
probably scale 342 pounds, at noon of
the following day. Corbett weighed
137% pounds yesterday morning.
He put in a big afternoon in the gym
nasium on Friday, boxing eight rounds
with Dave JBarry and George Herbert.
Ho has a sore nose as a souvenir of
the occasion. If Alex Greg-gaina finds
Corbett too much above weight to-mor
row he will send him into Marln County
to complete his training, where he' will
be away from the strengthening
breezes of the ocean.
Corbett has been matched to fight
Morris Thompson at Butte on Miners*
day, June 13. Whether he wins or loses
on Friday night. The weight will be
130 pounds at 0 o'clock. ' - -
When Eddie Hanlon puts up his props
in front of Young Corbett he will. not
lack for experienced advisers. ; behind
him. Shrewd Spider Kelly, will.be the
chief of seconds, and with the slim
coacher will be Trainer Frank McDon
ald, regarded by many as the best in
his clasÃ outside of the veteran," Billy
Delaney; Toby Irwin and another yet
to be chosen. Numerous friends, and
backers of Hanlon hold that .with
proper handling he would have >â¢ won
in his first battle. with the T>enver;iad.
and they hope that with Spider,;Ketly:s v
experienced eyts .und j tongue i-. \u25a0_\u25a0 nothing
will be overlooked that might tend to
insure a reversal of ; the decision that
Hanlon received when he met Corbett
before. â * -*-- - - --- â¢} â¢\u25a0â¢ -â¢ :' -
Eigrht miles of .road running in the
morning and forty strenuous minutes
with the -punching bag and skipping
rope constituted Hanlon's training work
yesterday at hi* Alameda quarters. Joe
Angeli and Toby Irwin will work in
the gymnasium this afternoon with Ed
die, and a large crowd is expected to go
across the bay to get a line on Han
lon and -witness him mix it with "the'
gloves if Trainer McDonald sees fit to
permit his charge to don the mitts.

SAN JOSE, j May 27.â A number.'of
boxing bouts scheduled to come' off at'
the picnic. of the 'Ariei-Rowlng Club of
San Francisco at the> Schuetzen ; Park
here to-morrow will , not be * permitted.
This was announced by Sheriff: Ross to
day. The Ariel Club; in announcing: its
picnic to-morrow, stated that Sam.Ber-'
ger and other well known exponents of
the manly art would, appear in limited
round bouts. Although the' club- was
notified that boxing matches -would- not
be allowed in this city, it continued- to
advertise the "fights just the same. "A
number of citizens and pastors of
churches ' have appealed to the ; Sheriff
to prevent the fights. A force of dep
uties have been assigned to the picnic
grounds and if any attempt is made to
pull' off the fistic contests the managers
and fighters will be at once arrested.

LOS ANGELES. May 27.â Goodwin,
who started to pitch the game for Loa
Angeles to-day, was taken out at the
end of tho fifth inning, after Tacoma
had made five hits and six runs. Toren,
who succeeded him, did no better. and
allowed six hits and four runs. Nor
dyke carried oft the batting honors,
getting a home run, a two-bagger and
two singles out of four times up. He
also made: fifteen put-outs and two
assists in 'the field without an error.
Keefe was hit for two-baggers, Cravath
and Dillon getting two each. He kept
the hits fairly well scattered, however,
and Los Angeles was badly beaten from
the start. In the third inning Umpire
Davis made four or five decisions whioh
did- not meet with the approval of the
crowd and about seventy-five spectators
from the left field bleachers rushed
out on ' the diamond, but the . police
drove them back before they could
reach the umpire. Score:

Ever since Rice Lake, in Minnesota,
was. frozen over it has been noticed
that a narrow channel was always
open at the thoroughfare leading to
Alder Lake. "Tom" Miller early one
morning noticed that a thin coating of
ice had formed during the night. While
looking at it he was astonished to see
a big muskallonge start from the cast
shore and, acting for all the world like
a tug bucking- heavy ice, break its way
to the other shore. Reaching that, the
big fish, which, according to Miller,
must " have weighed seventy-live
pounds, started back, trimming up the
rough edges of the channel. Mr. -Miller
says it was the most remarkable sight
he ever witnessed. "It was remarka
ble, indeed," remarks the Buffalo Com
mercial, " which adds : "TVe regard Mr.
Miller's effort as by far the best winter
fish story of the period."

A new golf story comes from Scot
land, where a couple of old antagon
ists meet on a course every Saturday
afternoon to determine their own pri
vate championship for the week. They
were all "square" at the seventeenth,
and the loser of last week had Just
played his third in the shape of a nics
approach to the green. Last week's
winner came up to his ball with grim
purpose/ He had an easy pitch 'to the
green, but a number of young sheep
were unconsciously browsing along the
edge, all oblivious of the Olympian
contest that was on the point oÂ£ set
tlement. "Rin forrard. laddie," said
last week's winner to his caddie, "and
drive awa* they lambs!" "Na, na."

"In 1807 ' Great Britain, had to break
Napoleon's, compulsory alliance,, framed
by the treaty of Tilsit, by seizing eight
een Danish and eight Portuguese bat
tleships and by.. blockading' the Russian
battleships.. Thus a fresh union of over
140 battleships was jnipped 'in the bud,'
but such decisive action , oould hot have
been taken had not Great Britain \ been
in the plenitude :of * her naval \ strength
with 212 battleships. y.WÂ« learn that
within a period ' of ; twentyxseveh -. year*
there were, three European allianoes of
three .- or more , great ; powers '\u25a0 against
Great Britain; and all were broken up
by the operation of sea power."
These .patrons have . no â¢ Interests
whien conflict in" any material n way,
their policies are identical and . neither"
power can be successfully, attacked ex
cept from the sea. Should they; jointly
agree to come ' to each other's \ assist
ance in the 'event of either power be
ing threatened by a coalition of three
maritime powers they could each afford
to reduce the rate. at which, as matter's
stand, they are compelled to add yearly
to the strength of their respective
navies. Says Lieutenant Bellairs:
"That population and riches . are no
match in war against such careful or
ganization, we have seen in the case
of Russia. It is only : the ' knowledge
that the sea barrier 'is \ impenetrable
which will effectually prevent : the ex
panding Teutonic, : Slavonic and Latin
races of Europe \ from / contemplating
aggression an the American continent.
If enabled to do so singly, nothing but
sea power will prevent. them from try
ing to effect : their , purpose In combina
tion. They have combined. in the past
for the partition of Poland. Uy the
Russian declaration : of February 26,
178 C, Russia," France. Spain, Holland,
Prussia, Sweden- and Denmark .com
bined to resist the | right of ; search and
the same powers were acting 1 together
against Great Britain over this quea,
tion in 1800.; -j: . '
In twelve years the naval expendi
ture of the United States has trebled,
while that of Great Britain has dou
bled, and under existing conditions the
international rivalry for supremacy on
the sea bids fair to necessitate { still
further Increase in the annual outlay
on the manufacture of fighting ships.
Lieutenant " Carlyon Bellairs of the
royal navy proposes an arrangement
between Great Britain and the, United
States which; would enable both:coun

Waldron created a new record for
" the season by tearing off six safe hits
out of six trips to the plate. Williams
â¢might have made a new strike-out rec
ord had he stayed a bit longer. In
the three and a half innings of his
caret r he winged seven men out Tbe
â¢core:
The Seals might have won in the
eigrlith. when Xealon led off with a
double. He had to wait vainly on the
eacks. for no one was good enough to
bring him through. In the ninth, tenth
aÂ«d eleventh the Seals started â¢well, but
hits were not forthcoming at the right
moment.
Russ Hall opened up the eleventh
â¢with a drive over second. O'Brien had
a sacrifice and Miller tore loose with
that old double of his against the cen
ter field fence that brought him both
revenge and victory.
When the fourth had been reeled off,
Roscoe. Miller began to pitch ball good
enough for any man's league The
Sc-aU could not pile up their hits with
so much regularity. The Si washes took
courage and . played good ball behind
Miller, so the game dragged wearily on
in the mist and the cold. J
History ttJls us. Hip Van Winkle was'
a lucky man, but he,-was no more lucky
that Mr. R. Miller. This cast -off of
Uncle's hammered out his revenge in
the shape of a. two-cushion shot yes
terday afternoon at Recreation Park
after starting the grame off four runs
to the bad. A little wlldness on the
part of EÂ»:rk Williams let the Si washes
make it a deadlock and Miller's little
clout broke it up. ;#'
The Seals just waded into the fast
ehooi* in the first couple of spasms and
wliat they accomplished was something
awful. Bingie after bingle was lined
out and liic score was 4 to 0 in a trice.
Then came a passed ball by Wilson and
Willis ras' ,w;ld::ess and a tie score that
ras>ted for eight rounds.
Waldron, the first man to face Miller,
landed for a single to center. Spencer
vas not there, but Wheeler and Irwin
tort off bingles. Xealon unloaded a
three-sacker out to the Scoreboard. In
the next round the Seals kept the good
v. ork up. though their two hits brought
xio runs. A couple of good ones fol
lowed in the next and it was 4 to 0 and
Eeattle seemingly out of "the going.
Williams' troubles commenced to run
â¢up fast in the fourth spasm. He struck
R. MiHer out and Kane flew to left.
Wilson dropped Dusty Miller's third
strike and then Dick grew erratic,
passing- Houiz, Kemmer and Frary and
forcing Kane home. Along came Mc-
Hale with a two-bagger that sizzled
past Irwin. Every one scored and the
deadlock was a reality.
Williams was unnerved by the sad
O^perience and could not pull himself
together even in the next spasm. The
Si washes soon sent another one
through, taking the lead. Williams
thÂ«n retired to the bench and Jimmy
Whalen took up the burden. Jimmy
was there and the Siwasbes soon re
tired, a double play from Gochnauer
to Wheeler to Spencer taking all the
fight out of them.

While the best : players entered hardly
figure in the championship class, they are
the cleverest in the city, and more than
half of them are evenly, matched. In
the upper half are Baker, H. Long.
Schmidt. Gabriel, Rolfe, Dr. Bush 'and
Busch. H. Long and Baker will meet in
the preliminary round, and one of the
best matches of the tournament will re
sult. Gabriel and Schmidt will furnish
a good exhibition in" the first round.
N In the lower half Gardner, M. Long,
Brabant and Foley . should cary off the
honors. It would not be surprising if
Baker and Gardner won the ; coveted
places In the finals. The drawing * fol
lows: <
The fifth annual tennis tournament for
the championship of San Francisco will
be played on the California Club courts
fo-day. The entry list is unusually, small
for an event of this kind, - only twenty
four players being entered/The fact that
it is a scratch event kept many players
out. There are .probably more active
tournament players in the ; city than ever
before, but there are fewer good players
than at any time in the past. ; This f un
questionably is the cause of the small
entry list in to-day's tournament.
The visitors will ; play the San Francis^
co County eleven to-day on the Alameda
grounds ; ; - . \.

One of the fantastic tricks which!
lightning: plays upon its unfortunate)
victims is a kind of flashlight photog
raphy. There are numerous instances
of this . which are more or less ' "au
thenticated," but they seem almost
too wonderful to be believed. One of
these la of a, young man in New Jer
sey, who was struck by lightning and
was taken in an ambulance to the hos
pital at once. There seemed to be no
wound except a small mark on \ tha ,
back;. but while the doctors and nurses
.were V examining . him a picture began .
to 'develop on the skin.' - Soon J before/
the wondering eyes of the watchers
appeared a , perfect picture of Christ
nailed to the ., cross. . .The explanation
is that \on the wall opposite the bed
on which ' the young . man lay was the
picture which was reproduced on. his
skin. . . , ;>
Another â¢ Instance la of a man who
was struck by lightning and on his
chest were red marks, resembling the
tree,, with all its -branches, uhder^
which the man was standing when heT
was ' killed. â¢ " From . France comes the
story of a peasant girl who was driving
a cow from the pasture when she was
overtaken by a storm and she and the
cow took refuge under the tree. A
bolt of lightning killed 1 the ' cow and
stunned the girl.' "When she recovered
consciousness ' she found on her : chest
a olcture of the cow she had been
driving.
: The chatelaine of the castle of.
\u25a0Benatonnaire was sitting in 'al chair* In'
her saloon ./.when ' ; the â¢ chateau was
struck by, lightning. unin-r
Jured, but on the back of her dress
was found a perfect copy/of the chair
on : which â¢ she had been sitting, , down ?
to i its minutest ornament These are
a : few of I the many, strange - pranks
which^ lightning play, upon us.âChi

Tha snow In the blizzard of 183S was
drier and finer than that of the 25th
uIL Z have the keenest recollection ' of
the torrible 12th of March, for I walked
from "Washington square to Newspaper
Row and had both ears frostbitten.,
Not a car, train, truck, carriage or
cab was moving at the time. For
seven years I could not sleep with my
ear touching the pillow, but the frost*
bite gradually wore Itself out. It may
sound like a ghost story, yet it is a
solemn fact that while my ears wers
in a frozen state I pinched off pieces
of the helix without feeling the slight
est t>aln. "When the thaw cameâ gods I
With it the blood flowed, giving a lit
tle relief. On Wednesday these ears
remembered their frostbite. \u25a0 Old -folks
have told jme a hundred times that
frostbite never wholly disappears from
the human body.
The ISSS blizzard began on March
11. When turning in for the night I
left the windows of my bedroom down
a Quart er-inch from the top, yet tha
snow, as fine as coriander seeds and
perfectly dry, beat its way in until
it formed a bank as high as the win
dow sill (2 H feet) and extended three-*
fourth of the way across the floor.
There were about two carloads of it
within when I awoke next morning.
On -Wednesday it did not seem quit*
so penetrating, though it managed â¢ to
steal in at every tightly closed window
of my roost. Absalom, the famous
English cricketer, once traversed the>
Great Victoria Desert In Australia, and
his tales of what the sand can do and
does do in a simoon would make Mun
chauaen look like gospel truth.
-- Snow will manage to get inside of a
window where rain in the severest
storm cannot penetrate. I have seen it
blown under the putty and around tha
rabbet of the sash on the inside- of tha
panes. So ' have you. But Australian
sand. Absalom's party nearly died off
starvation because sand got into all
their : provisions, even into the her
metically sealed and bottles securely,
corked. It went through leather, rub
ber, iron. It buried itself- In the skin
until a man felt like a piece of* emery,
paper. The scientist of the party got
several hollow glass balls and an
chored them in a simoon. They wera
from three to five inches in diameter,
of material and eighth of an inch thick.
Result â After the blow they were dis
covered to be about a third full oi
sand. â New York Press.

Mayor Schmitz occupied a prominent
feat at the right hand of the host and
many other prominent city and State
officials were ranged near him. Gov
ernor Pardee was unable to be present,
but he' sent a letter regretting his in
ability to be present and wishing that
lie could be in two places at one time
co that he might be capable of par
* taking In the festivities.
The guests began " to " arrive early,
though the banquet did not begin till
aÃout 9 o'clock. They filed In by ones
â¢ end twos and bunches and shook hands
.'with the Chevalier and wished him
many another such happy anniversary.
He was the center of attraction and
'was as happy as a child as he bade his
friends welcome and shook the hands
of men he had not seen in many years.
Fugazi led the way to the large ban
"quet hall. The place was profusely
' decorated with the flags of the United
States and Italy, as well as with beau
tiful flowers and evergreens. Most of
the guests were seated at the long
table, which extends the entire length
of the room, but many were also ac
commodated at smaller tables at each
' tide.
tSPBKCHES LOUDLY CHEERED.
The menu was an elaborate one and
c guests were- kept busy discussing
for more than an hour. A concealed
-.chestra discoursed sweet melodies.
Many acquaintances were renewed at
the board and the time passed pleas
antly.
S. F. Booth acted as toastmaster of
"the evening. He was lustily cheered
as he arose to extend his greetings.
He then commenced the reading of the
letters and telegrams of congratulation
from friends of the Chevalier in the
East and elsewhere, who 'could not be
present at the banquet. When the com
munication from tne Governor was read
it was -the occasion for a general out
break of applause and the State's chief
executive was cheered many times.
Speeches were made by Mayor
Schmitz, Judson C. Brusie, Chevalier
J. F. Fugazi, City Attorney Percy V.
Jxmg:. J. C. Sims. D. E. McKinlay. Rob
ert Capelle. Arthur R. Briggs and
Charles S. Fee. All were full of wit
and compliments to the host and all
rame in for a goodly share of applause
tfrom the assembled guests.

One of the merriest banquets of the
year took place at the California Hotel
last night, when more than 300 friends
;of Chevalier J. F. Fugazi gathered
round the festal board to celebrate the
Yorty-flf th anniversary of the arrival
of their hoÃt at the FoUom-street
wharf In this city. Good fellowship
prevailed from the moment the host
bade his guests be seated till the ban
quet broke up with the singing of
"Home, Sweet Home."
Chevalier Fugazi is the Pacific Coast
general agent for" the French line of
steamships and for the Delaware, Lack
\u25a0 a wanna and Western Railroad, and Is
also president of the Columbia Savings
Society. He is one of the best known
railroad men on the coast and his
guests were mostly . from the railroad
fraternity. In fact, the banquet was
the occasion for one of the largest
gatherings of railroad men ever known
In this city.
Representatives of every line were
there. Clerks, heads of departments,
passenger agents and In fact railroad
men of every rank sat down side by
side to spend a pleasant evening with
their genial host. Eastern officials
who could not be present were
thoughtful enough to send telegrams to
the Chevalier, informing him of their
at missing the good time and
'wishing him many another happy an
niversary.
