Parsifal" influence only has been
brought to b*Â»ar upon us, and that, nn
the whole, a happy one. Much has been
said and written in ridicule of the Al
cazar's little production of the play.
The Conried production proves it to
have been in Its admired humility and
sincere reverence a quite sympathetic
if quite lowly forerunner of the great
"Parsifal."
Twenty-three years ago â seven
months before the death of the com
poser- â the work was first performed
in the sacred playhouse at Bayreuth.
The Christmas eve of 1903, more than
twenty years afterward, saw Its first
performance outside of Bayreuth in
the Metropolitan Opera-house, New
York. Extraordinarily, we ourselves,
at the end of the world, have had to
wait only another year for the music

TWENTY PAGESâ SAN FRANCISCO, SATURDAY, APRIL 8, 1905 âPAGES 1 TO 10.
Herr Conried from the height* at
Bayreuth is an old one, though the
; artistic and ethical righteousness of
' the adventure are still debatable. If,
las Wagner seems to have believed,
I rightly to hear "Parsifal" it is neces
j sary to steep one's self for a while in
the quaint mediaevalism of Bayreuth,
then is it manifestly unfair to walk in
on the play from Mission street, with
its inferno of modern sights and
sounds and smells. If, as Herr Con
ried more subtly contends, you take
your Bayreuth with you, then, given
the same adequacy of production,
your "Parsifal" will triumph even in
a Potrero.
But rightly or wrongly one is hugely
grateful for yesterday's opportunity to
hear music-drama. Further the
provincial imagination refuses the task
of picturing a performance of "Parsi
fal" more loftily-compelling in its
spell, more exalted in its splendor, more
human in its appeal, than the one giv
en on Mission street yesterday by
Herr Conried's people.
It was a performance unique, a per

Miss Bella Alten will make her San
Francisco debut this afternoon as Ned
da in "Pagliacci. " She is said to be a
revelation in the part. Mr. Caruso
6hould outdo himself as Canio, a role
in which he has thrilled thousands of
opera goers. Much curiosity is felt as
to the Tome of Mr. Gofitz, which is
said to be remarkable. Another nota
ble feature of the matinee at the Grand
Opera-house will doubtless be the San
tuzsa of Madame Maria de Macchi,
which by many good critics has been
proclaimed the most dramatic and real
istic presentation of the character yet
seen upun the American boards. The
Lola of Madame Josephine Jacoby
should be of distinct interest. Mr. Dip

including Madame Nordica. Madame

IN LOBBIES
Comment on "Parsi
fal" From Different
Viewpoints.
Mang Words of Praise
and Quite a Few
Less Kindlu.
JAMES C. CRAWFORD
Lay criticisms of the performance of
"Parsifal." as overheard in the lobbies,
seenrrd to be shaped in accoTd with
the critic's pronunciation of the com
poser's surname. The lady who softly
gurgled it "Vawgner" had only ap
proval to besow. while the commen
taries of the gentleman who rasped it
"Weggoner" were on a plane of harsh
ness with his vocal tone. Modified
opinion was rare. Those who did not
rave in ecstacy over the "show," either
voiced complete dissatisfaction with it
or practiced reticence.
It would have been unfair to mea
sure the merit of the entertainment by
the applauce it received, because the
first spontaneous handpatter was sup
pressed by a sibilant and prolonged
"H-i-s-h!" from the ushers, who evi
dently were under instruction to pre
serve the "reverential atmosphere," rel
ative to which a great deal of twaddle
was exploded. After the second act a
longhaired man si; ped beer in the bar
room and deplored as saci.^ge the re
peated recalling of ..ordica and Burg
staller, because of its shattering ef
fect on the "reverential atmosphere."
Those who made the demonstration, he
declared, had not the Wagner virus in
their blood, else they could no more
have done what they did than they
could have hissed. A peculiar effect of
the inoculation, he said, is its tendency
to repress emotional expression. The
more thoroughly one becomes initiated
in the Bayreuth cult the less is he or
she â mostly she â inclined to indulge in
the hand-clappings and shoutings prac
ticed by the non-elect. In other words,
the feelings become too deep for ut
terance. To properly absorb the the
matic music of Wagner one must per
ish the visual sense. To hear is suffi
cientâto see is soul-distracting. The
harmonious blending of the voices and
the instruments suffice to instill the de
sired rapture. The acting and the
staging are superfluities. So far as he
was concerned â¢Parsifal," with those
singers and that orchestra, would be
just as' enthralling if it were inter
preted in a barn with tallow dips for
footlights.
"Then, why. sir." I ventured, "did
Herr Conried clothe 'Parsifal' with such
costly garniture?"
"Because," he kindly explained, "all
of us are not possessed of the real spirit
of Wagnerism. The tinsel and the glit

WAGNER'S SUBUNEST
Or MUSICAL APT HAS
GPIP UPON THE SOUL
Perhaps More Than Ever in Its History Grand
Opera-House Is Crowded to Hear
Pride of Bayreuth.
PROBLEM AS TO PROPER DRESS IS SOLVED
Men and Women Follow Their Proverbial
Western Independence by Doing Ex
actly as Pleased Them.
THE HOUSE IS NOT ESSENTIALLY SMART
SALLY SHARP
With "Parsifal" â "Parsifal" the big.
"Parsifal" the grand â crowding,
clashing, clanging through my brain
and surging through my soul. I beg to
renounce my conviction of yester
night that the joy of grand opera is
50 per cent "atmosphere."
I beg to eliminate "Parsifal " from
anything less sublime than art. and
art that reaches into the souls and the
bodies of men.
When men's physical, mental and
spiritual entities are suddenly waked
â yes, and thrilled till the tears well
up and queeriah lumps gather in the
throat*, the thing that wrought these
things is art, and sublime art.
To that category does "Parsifal" be
long--sans "atmosphere," sans glitter,
sans eownÃ
Methinks there never was in the
old opera-house a soberer or more
serious audience than sat from
5 by the town clock until 6:40 and from
8:45 till 11:30. And during these taut
hours the intensity that filled the house
like a vapor could be felt with as much
realism as a draught or a sudden pain.
Now that "Parsifal" has come â and
gone for the nonceâ the awful doubt
that has hovered over us of the West
for weeks has liftedâ the problem of
"How shall I dress?"
Now, that is a serious matterâ this
thing of dressing for 5 o'clock in the
daylight, and then again for the normal
hour of darknessâ and without a pre
cedent to show us.
To be sure, there was New York to
help out. and the advice of the privi
leged few of our townsfolk who had
heard "Parsifal" at Bayreuth. So we
bunched these together and went ahead
and made a precedent, and herewith Is
the precedent for the San Francisco
productions of "Parsifal"-' Wear what
you darn Dlease." Good news!!
Well, last night ther? were loads <->f
men who came in their tweedsâ and
quite properly, it being before 6. ThÂ»n
there were loads more of them who
came in their evenin- togs and who
seemed mightily pleased that their au
dacity had saved them from a hurry
up dinner and a frantic dash into their
clawhammers.
But it remained for the women to
clinch the "go-as-you-please" decision,
for they came in full evening panoply,
with fluttering frou-frous and the
vague charm of bared throats; they
camo in calling gowns, oertopped with
hats <>f posies; they came in prim tailor
gowns and the stiff Puritan hats that
must have been shocked at Kundry'a
hct pleadingsâ and there you are! That
was the "Parsifal" house, as a duly
qualified society editor found it.
Then again it was not essentially a
"society" house. Rather was it of the
fine music-loving middle-class, with
the smart set as a sprinkle â nothing to
compare with the grand pageantry of
"Rig'->letto" of the night before.
But that audience, filling the house
from the black pit to turquoise dome.
was there â for the most part â to hear
'"Parsifal" because it wanted to know
Jt, and not because it's "proper."
True, there are always posers hang
ing over every cult, but the poser who
will lend his mind and body to four
hours (nearly) of "Parsifal" will either
quit posing or become an adept.
One of the strongest features of the
music-drama was the amazing number
of rren who came to hear the story
of the Holy Grail.
Thtre were those of us who were un
holy enough to suspect the men would
fight a little shy of so solemn a thing
as "Parsifal." But that wae one time
when "woman intuition" didn't make
good. It often does that trick now
adays, since we've learned to take a
few fllnzs at reason.
And the men were magnificently in
tent, most of them. Some few â don't
cajole me into naming names, now.
please â declared "the thing was too
beastly slow and half of it shtould be
cut out." But of course these fellows
were Philistines.
That comment has set me to wonder
ing what phrases they would lead to
the slaughter* â not the flower maiden
scene, I'll wager! And assuredly not
the mad, throbbing, virile, elemental,
passionate scene between Parsifal and

a madness.
Here it was that the (JoM and the
Bad were called to the footlights four,
five, a half-dozen times, until the air
was vibrant with and each of
us in that house was kin to the other.
This Is "Parsifal," the big. the grand,
which is 100 per cent artâ the "atmos

Special DUnau-h to The Call
LONDON. April 7.â Lady Evelyn
(iuinnees is accounted one of the pret
tiest youthful matrons in English so
<iÂ»-ty and is generally voted the best
dancer in London. She has a double
claitn on h^r heritage at good \OOkM.
Her father, the Earl of Buchan. is still
known by the sobriquet of the "Pocket
Adonis" â sometimes abbreviated to
"F. A. ' â which was bestowed on him
in his youthful days because of his
diminutive figure and handsome fea
tures. Time has dealt lightly with
him; he is still a great dandy and his
dress always exemplifies the latest cor
rect thing in masculine fashions. He
mated with a beauty. Miss Rosalia
Sartoris, of mingled Irish and Spanish
descent, who combined in a rare de
gree the feminine charm of both races.
It is natural, therefore, that Lady
Evelyn should be of the ideal Dresden
china type, petite, with delicate color
ing and a mass of soft, fair hair. Shi
married two years ago, when she was
only I*., the youngest son of Lord
Iveagh. Youngest sons of peers do
not usually come in for much, but Lord
Iveagh belongs to what Labouchere
calls the "beerage," and being in con
sequence many times a millionaire has
made princely settlements on ea<h <>f
his three sons, who, by the way. all be
came benedicts in the same year.
In addition to a fine home in Dublin.
Lady Evelyn is mistress of a beautiful
old country place near Bury St. Ed
munds, where she recently entertained
the Queen. Jewels set off her dainty
style of beauty well, and she has a
magnificent aÂ«sortment of them.

TREATY TERMS
ON WAY TO FEZ
TANGIER. April 7.â lt is reported
that a German mission, headed by
Count yon Tattenbach-Ashold. former
Minister of Germany to Morocco, will
shortly proceed to Fez and arrange a
special German-Moroccan commercial
treaty, the proposed terms of which are
already on their way to Fez.
PARIS, April 77â Foreign Minister
D'elcasse, answering questions in the
Chamber of Deputies to-day relative to
the status of Morocco, said the policy
which the national interests of France
u-qulred her to pursue had long been
fully known. When that policy was con
s' (rated by certain international agree
ments public opinion here and abroad
approved of it as a further guarantee
"f I ninging order and security to Mo
rocco. Continuing the Foreign Minister
said:
"W T e seek to make the Moroccan au
thorities understand the practical ad
vantages of having the nominal preca
rious authority of the Sultan fortified
and extended so that the condition of
the population may be ameliorated by
security and respect given to their cus
toms and beliefs. We put this before
them mildly as friends, patiently also,
as becomes neighbors, not having need
of a precipitate solution, and we will
continue our task with the tranquillity
of people who are wronging no one and
who contemplate nothing wrong to the
interests of any one."
WASHINGTON, April 7.â The British
Embassador called on Secretary Taft
and discussed with him the* Morocco
situation, with a special reference to
the note which had been handed the
Secretary by the German Embassador
relating to the open door. The British
Embassador expressed an opinion sim
ilar to that of the French Embassador
âthat the open door In Morocco obtains

HOUSE OF -COMMONS HOLDS
AN ALL-NIGHT SESSION
Measurr legalizing Marriage With a
Deceased Wife's Sister PaaseÂ»
Its Second Reading.
â¢LONDON, April 7. â The House of
Commons, which sat all night discuss
ing the army bill, resumed Its labors
at noon to-day, when the measure
legalizing marriage with a deceased
wife's sister came up for Its annual
discussion. The effect of the long ses
sion, however, was seen In the vacant
benches and It was an hour after the
usual time of opening before a quorum
was secured.
After a discussion, in which Lord
Hugh Cecil and other opponents of the
measure contended that it transgressed
the fundamental laws of British
morality, the bill passed its second
reading by 149 to 64 votes.
The deceased wife's sister bill has
already passed the House of Commons
seven times, but there is no evidence
that it will be more cordially received
in the House of Lords, where it has
always been defeated, than heretofore.

SOLDIERS' FAMILIES SUFFER.
New Problem Confronts the Authori
ties in Russia.
ST. PETERSBURG, April 7.â The ef
forts of the police to smother the polit
ical agitation have led them to invade
the cemeteries in their search for evi
dence of treason. It has become the
practice of students to place on the
graves of comrades who were active
or who suffered in the cause of free
dom wreaths bound with ribbons on
which political sentiments are inscribed.
The police now make nocturnal visits
to the cemeteries in search- of these
treasonable mottoes, which are prompt
ly confiscated.
The stories of sufferings on the part
of the widows, wives and families of
soldiers are attracting general atten
tion, and the public demands Govern
ment aid for the sufferers. The local
charities are no longer able to cope
with the situation. In many places the
funds raised for this purpose are en
tirely exhausted, and the provincial
papers are filled with pathetic accounts
of starving mothers and children beg
ging in the streets.
At Nljni Novgorod the palace of the
Governor was besieged by a crowd of
hungry women with babes In their arms
asking for bread. The Governor in
formed the women that he would ap
point a commission to investigate the
situation. His reply aroused the ire of
the local press. The Vledomosti said:
"Always the eternal commission. While
it is investigating the women and chil
dren will starve."
M. Pobiedonostseff's position, that of
Procurator General of the Holy Synod,
will be abolished if the patriarchate is
re-established, and Antonius. the Met
ropolitan of St. Petersburg, as the
highest Archbishop, will become patri
arch.
Under the new press regulations the
papers are not permitted to publish
anything regarding the Emperor and
the imperial family without the consent
of the court censorship. The Imperial
Chancellory has formally requested the
Kobeko commission, which is revising
the press regulations, to include this re
striction, and -such a request the com
mission regards as being equivalent to
an imperial order.

NEW YORK. April 7 -R. G. Dun A

Recent gains In the voiumÂ« of busi

j Improvement is somewhat iwtariad by
J unfavorable weather in some MCttaM
j Buyers are still arriving at the l^Ung
i cities placing additional spring order*,
and most fall lines that have been
opened are meeting with an encourag
ing reception. Despite occasional re
quests for extensions, collections are
more prompt on the whole.
Manufacturing returns are all that
could be desired, building operations
expand as the season advances and ag
ricultural prospects are better than
normal. There is little friction between
capital and labor, most new wage
scales being arranged on the old basis,
and in some cases advances are grant
ed, while the number of unemployed is
steadily decreasing. Freight traffic Is
very helvy, some congestion occur
ring, and railway earnings in March
were 9.2 per cent larger than last year.
Foreign commerce at this port la very
heavy, the exports for the last week
exceeding the same week In 1304 by
$1,590,709, while imports Increased 11,
975.296.
Increased activity is noted in the h.dÂ«
market.

the corresponding week last year.
Failures in Canada number 28. against

and 29 last year.
NEW YORK. April 7. â Bradstreet's
to-morrow will say:
Grain crops, trade and Industrial re
ports are in the main favorable, ex
ceptions being noted In the South,
where cotton planting is backward and
a reduced acreage Is expected, and at
a few points In the "West, where in
clement weather and bad roads tend to
check the otherwise full tide of spring
activity. Western merchants who
earlier In the season bought conser-
Tatively are now reordering freely.
Money continues easy at most points.
Collections show improving tendencies,
though many cities report them only
fair. Gross railway earnings for March
indicate a gain of 9 per cent over a
year ago.
Relatively the best reports come
from the great West, the buoyancy of
the advices from which is tn marked
contrast with the same period a year
ago. Estimates of the quarter's busi
ness at the leading Western markets
range from 5 to 15 per cent gain over
1904. Uniform good trade reports
come from the Pacific Coast.
Measures of recently past trade and
financial operations point to an enor

1905.
Failures in the United States for the
week ending April 6 number 170,
against 267 last week and 201 last
year.
Failures in Canada for the first

Society Holds Sway

Society folk thronged the Palace and
St. Francis hotels yesterday afternoor
and evening after the opera. The din
ing and grill rooms of the two big
hotels presented a memorable sight as
the fashionable hundreds sauntered in
to partake of dinner and supper and
discuss Wagner's masterpiece.
The crowds began to arrive shortly
before 7, when the Intermission of the
opÂ«ra took place. The men changed
their afternoon clothes for evening
dress, although the hour was yet early
The fair maids and matrons looked re
splendent In dazzling gowns and
chatted merrily to their escorts while
discussing the repast.
Dinner was served at the Palace Ho
tel In the palm room and In the ladies'
gTill room. The crowd was so great
that It waa necessary to plaoe tables
in the men's grill room to accommo
date the guests. The hotel presented
a brilliant scene while the repast last
ed, but shortly before 9 o'clock the
crowds began to file out, and In a few
minutes the place was well nigh de
serted.
The same gorgeous scene was appar
ent after the conclusion of the opera,
w hen supper was served. Again the big
crowds surged In and again they
chatted and talked till the meal was
concluded. The procession to the
hacks and carriages lasted for several
hours.
The scene at the St. Francis was
I brilliant than that at the
Pala< . The beautiful white and gold
room and the grill room were crowded
with merry guests. In fact, it was
c largest collections of people
at the great hostelry.

formance the like of which one will
never hear again. One wondered at
first just what was the matter, for the
play had the luck of the bad begin
ning. The trumpets at 5 o'clock sum
moned a crowd sleepy after the stren
uous opening of the evening before â it
is anyway a difficult hour for enthusi
asms. Then the audience was sheep
ishly conscious as' to its gowning. Not
a few care to see "Parsifal" as a spe
cial Lenten function. Neck-high these
were gowned both afternoon and even
ing, and the rest thought they ought
to have been. Then there was the in
evitable sag after the expectancy of
the largely, lengthily heralded thing,
and the first feeling of "Parsifal" was
something akin to disappointment.
Mr. Alfred Hertz, who made his debut
as conductor here yesterday, at first
had evidently not gripped his men.
They came lazily to the beat. The
brass happened in politely after the
strings, the strings in turn fluttered in
after the woodwind, and the rhythm
was not. Conductor and men were evi
dently at odds, and one audaciously
wondered at the Hertz reputation.
Then^ came Mr. Blass, magnificent in
poise and dignity as Gurnemanz, chief
knight of the Grali. Van Rooy, noble
basso, came next, as Amfortas, the
wounded king. Followed then an in
tense moment at Nordica's entrance
as Kundry, the orchestra treading more
surely with each measure. And then
came Alois Burgstaller, Mid with him,
the Parsifal, the reason for the agita
tion and uncertainty of the perform
ance so far.
I do not wish to hear another per
formance of "Parsifal" like Mr. Burg
staller's last night. I never expect to
hear one. Perhaps in the circum
stances the tenor could not have sung
in any other role. Perhaps, and the
greater the heroism, any other role
would have been preferable. For, as
Kundry sang to the "Parsifal." "His
mother grieves no more, for she is
dead," she sang to the one who only
an hour or so before had learned that
his mother would indeed grieve no
more.
It Is difficult coolly to consider a
performance in such circumstances.
The simple heroism of the thing over
shadows for the moment any technical |

considerations. But the role of Parsi
fal, sometimes heavily indicted for its
lack of humanness, held last night a
weight of tears, a trembling note of
grief that brought it pitifully into the
human comedy.
Small wonder was it that in the Cir
cean scene, the Kundry, half-maternal,
half-siren, should accent the mother
note. But Mr. Burgstaller, as he is a
hero, is also an artist of the first rank.
Perhaps he will never again get the
piercing note of sympathy that his
voice held last night, but it is a voice
sufficient to the last demand for the
role, smooth, resonant, flexible and
splendidly dramatic. Perhaps Mr. Burg
staller will never again get quite the
same divine uplift in his acting of the
Wagner Messiah as he got last night,
but there is evident a strong dramatic
temperament and a personality singu
larly fortunate in the suggestion of the
innocence and purity of the character.
He, like Van Dyck, is tremendously
tall and broad in build, and should be
an ideal Lohengrin.
Xordica was the Kundry. and all her
old brilliant, ' radiant self. I have
never heard her sin* better than she
Bang last night, and I've heard a
Brunnhilde or two in my time. In the
temptation of Parsifal the singer
lacks suppleness, lacks insinuation,
locks what they say Fremstad has in
high degree, the regnant devUtry of
the character. She is not for a mo
ment the "Rose of Hell, " as Wagner
eher, only as she sings; never for
oment the Lilith woman, the
>dias, the conquering "strange
woman" of all time. She is in fact
rather a motherly sort of body, but
magnificent looking at that, in auburn
locks and shimmering silver gown.
Her first act, when Kundry comes in
clothed in skins, sullen and fiery, was
again splendidly conceived and acted,
and throughout the part was brilliant
ly sung.
After the temptation scene the re
calls were too numerous to count. The
audience went crazy in good old Tlvoll
fashion, and shouted and stamped un
til it brought Mr. Hertz, delightfully
awkward, but apparently very much
pleased with the attention.
Van Rooy was another among the
new singers, and handsomely notable.
His Amfortas was as near like life as
It was possible to make it, and most
cleverly mediaeval and aloof from the
rest. He sings in delightfully authori
tative and sympathetic fashion.
Then came Mr. Goritz as Klingsor,
the magician. Mr. Goritz gave a most
ingeniously effective portrait in melo
dramatic key of the magician, singing
brilliantly through the part. Mr. Blass
was the Gurnemanz, and distinguished
the role 'to its utmost possibilities.
As I have said, the prelude to "Par
sifal" left one unsatisfied, but after
ward, through the Grail music, Kun
dry's tender chant of the death of
Herzelied, the procession of the
knights, the sensuously enchanting
musio of the flower maidens, the Good
Friday music, the Interest never waned.
One has heard much of the evidences
of waning powers in the "Parsifal." It
seemed yesterday the orown and flower
of Wagner's genius. Perhaps the mu
sio has not the bite, the grip, the dra
matic majesty of some of the earlier
work, but in the richness of theme, In
the splendor of orchestration, and
again in the subtle weld of scene and
word and song, Wagner has done noth
ing more characteristic, nothing finer.
As a picture play nothing lovelier
has been seen here. We got before
dinner the lake at Montsalvat, the
way there â with forest, tree and
looming rocks moving before you â to
the temple of the Holy Grail. The
temple itself, with its fretted golden
doors, marble pillars and vista on
vista deepening into the distance, is
an unforgettable picture. Here, Ara
fortas, haloed from above, with the
grail glowing like a huge ruby in his
hand, stands. The magic garden, its
blossoms changed into dead stick and
leaf at the touch of Parsifal's spear,
is another lovely scene.
Everything, in fact, that can con
duce to Illusion has been done, except
killing a real swan In place of the
canton flannel affair that they make
such an unconvincing fuss over when
Parsifal "kills" it. The flower girls,
lightly garbed and lightly footed, look
as well as they sound. And Mr. Hertz
conducted to entire admiration.
As to the religious side?
Schopenhauer, the old Northern Sa
gas, the New Testament, the Vedas of
India, such literature as the "Scented
Garden" of Sir Richard Burton, the
gospels of the early Christian fathers
have all contributed to the curious
hybrid philosophy of the drama. It is

again as distinctly mediaeval In Its
symbolism as "Everyman," while at
the same time as distant as the poles
from that warm-human brusque, full
blooded miracle play in its atmosphere.
The miracles of "Parsifal" are too
veiled, alien, non-human, to wound the
most delicate religious sense.
Kundry washing the feet of Parsifal
offends no more than would a pictured
Magdalen washing the feet of Christ in
the east window of a cathedral. The
Knights of the Grail at the breaking of
bread are more humanly aloof than the
painted apostles In the Rubens "Last
Supper." In fact, even as far as the
scene of the dove descending upon the
head of Parsifal almost the whole
music-drama impresses as a series of
wonderful moving pictures set to mu
sic. The only situation in which the
play becomes dramatic and human is
the temptation of Parsifal, and even
here Kundry is the incarnate "strange
woman" of the centuries, a type rather
than a personage.
Altogether "Parsifal," by any ad

cannot be missed.

Wagner for Wagner's sake alone â for

It is the oi>era itself that wearies

(DISTINGCISHED FRENCH ARMY OFFICER. *VHO6E HOME IS SAID TO HAVE

PARIS, April 7.â The investigations

mined whether the arms and uniforms
recently seized in the suburbs of Paris
were intended for a chimerical African
expedition or a seditious movement
against the Government. Statements
made hy Deputy Rabier tend to show
th* existence of a plot.
M. Rabier recently received letters

letters, but he recently decided to sub

movement, which included a number
of Deputies and one former Cabinet

necessary arrangements, uniforms and
equipment* were ready and recruiting
was going on among the retired col

It is said that Premier Rouvier, as
other officials, received similar warn

existed, appears to have been nipped in

NEW DU BARRY
NOT A SUCCESS
Richepin's Play With Same
Theme as Belasco's Given
Harsh Criticism in London
YANKEEDRAMASABROAD
Hall Came Studies Games of
Chance in Order to Make
a Eealistic Stage Scene
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LONDON, April 7. â David Belasco
Is evidently a better playwright than
M. Jean Richepin. That is the im
pression one receives from the French
author's "Dv Barry," which Mrs.
Brown Potter has Just produced In
English at the Savoy Theater. M.
Richepin made a fuss, it will be re
membered, when Belasco's "Dv Barry"
was triven in America two or three
years ago and declared that the best of
it was stolen from him. Nothing came
of his protests, however, and the
Belasco play earned a lot of money
for its author and Mrs. Leslie Carter.
Now the adaptation of Richepin's
"Dv Barry" which Mrs. Brown P6t
' ter is using is an "authorized" one â
, a free adaptation, no doubt, and one
; made in accordance with Mrs. Pot
: ter's ideas and those of her manager,
Gilbert Hare. Charles Brookfleld was
originally chosen for this work. But
for some reason Brookfield's version
; failed to please Mrs. Potter and so a
new adaptation of "Dv Barry" was
made by Christopher St. John, who is
a member of the American actress'
; company. Gilbert Hare had a hand in
it, too, and this version of the Riche
pin play it was that saw the light at
; the Savoy the other night.
Just what M. Richepin thought of it
â¢ has not been divulged. The French
author supervised all the final rehear
sals, however, and occupied a box on
the first night, so there is every reason
to suppose that he considered that the
i Savoy play represented him fairly.
In that case David Belasco is fully
entitled to pat himself on the back.
Critics in America stated that he had
put the story of Louis XV's favorite on
ihÂ«Â» stage so as to make it dramatically
effective. This Richepin has failed to
do. One wonders, in fact, how Mrs.
Brown Potter could have thought his
play worth lavishing money upon.
FEW EFFECTIVE SCENES.
That money was lavished on this
"Dv Barry" there is no doubt. The
piece is acted by a numerous and ex
perienced cast, including besides Gil
bert Hare, W. L. Abington, who re
cently returned from America; Jerrold
Robertshaw and Herbert Rosa. The
setting is uncommonly beautiful. Spe
cial incidental music of real value ac
companies the action. It is most un
fortunate that Mrs. Brown Potter's
munificence is so frequently misplaced.
"The Golden Light," her first produc
tion at the Savoy, must have cost thou
s-andp of pounds to present. It was
pretty bad. "Church and Stage," the
Vicar of Gorleston's play, got as sump
tuous a production as the American
actreap could give it â and it ran less
' than a week.
The Richepin "Dv Barry" is a melo
drama that contains not a single new
situation and few effective ones. Four
hours long on the opening night, Jt
takes its heroine from her bonnet shop
days to the scaffold, in a prologue,
three acts and three tableaux. In this
version the Dv Barry is ruined and
banished from court because of the
King's discovery that she really loves
Prince Rohan de Rochefort, a disciple
of Rousseau, and friend of the people.
Then we see her a prisoner in the Con
ciergerie, in which her lover is also
confined. A passport to safety is con
voyed to her, but she gives it to her
sweetheart, whom phe tells that two
have been given her, and he escapes
I while she is carried off.
Mrs. Brown Potter as Dv Barry
: looks more beautiful than ever and
; do^s well in the lighter scenes, while
Gilbert Hare makes his Louis XV a
truly royal figure. It will be rather
surprising, however, if a success is
scored at the Savoy.
AMERICANS TO PLAY.
Londoners are uncommonly interest
; ed in the several important American
productions which are promised as soon
as Lent is over. According to present
arrangements Miss Maxine Elliott will
open in "Her Own Way" at the Lyric
Theater on Easter Monday. McLel
lsn's play, "Leah Kleschna," which is
the most eagerly awaited item in the
Mason's programme, was put in re
hearsal at the New Theater yesterday.
Lena Ashwell is, of course, to play
Mrs. Fiske's part, while Sir Charles
; Wyndham, who is still on the ocean,
I will be the hero. It is expected that
I the piece will be ready for production
1 two or three days after Easter.
By far the most important of the
coming American enterprises in Lon
don, however, is that of the Schu
berts, who are going to open their now
London playhouse on May 6, with al
ternate performances of grand opera
and classic European drama. To be
gin with Calve will appear in the opera
"Adrlenne Lecouvreur," and Slgnora
Duse in the play of the same name,
and later on Edouard de Reszke, Bond
and Ancona will be heard. Events of
special interest also will be the ap
pearances in Italian opera of those
two promising young American sing
ers, Mary Garden and Alice Nielsen.
The forthcoming presentation of J. M.
Barries new play, in which Ellen Terry
Is to appear, is to all Intents and pur
poses also an American production, as
Charles Frohman is making It. Lewis
Waller Is getting ready to revive
"Monsieur Beaucaire," and with "Uncle
Sam's Lads in Blue" crowding the Hip
podrome nightly and trans-Atlantic
comedians at all the music halls, there
Is a distinct boom in "Americans," if
a Stock Exchange phrase may be used.
CAINE OX THE RIVIERA.
It will not be Hall Calne's fault If
the gambling scenes In the coming pro
duction of his dramatised novel, "The
Prodigal Son," are not thoroughly real

of material. In dealing with the book

MORMON CHURCH ROW
IS TAKEN INTO COURT
SUIT IS FILED TO PROTECT FUNDS
PRESIDENT OF THE MORMON CHURCH, AGAINST WHOM SUIT HAS BEEN
BROUGHT BY AN KXCOMMUNICATKD MEMBER TO ENJOIN HIM FROM
1.-ING THE TITHINGS FOR INVESTMTiNT IN COMMERCIAL. ENTERPRISES.
SALT LAKE, April 7.â An injunc
tion suit was tiled in the Third Judicial
District Court to-day asking the court
to restrain the Church of Jesus Christ
of Latter-day Saints and Joseph F.
Smith, its president and trustee in
trust, from investing the tithing of the
church for any other than church pur
poses. The petitioners are Charles A.
Smurthwaite of Ogden, who recently
was excommunicated from the church,
and Don C. W. Musser, a member of
the church who yesterday voted
against sustaining the twelve apostles.
The petition, after setting forth that
the tithing paid by members of the
church amounts to $1,000,000 a year,
and that Joseph F. Smith, as trustee
in trust for the church, has each year
since his elevation to the presidency
invested fully half a million dollars in
sugar factories, woolen mills, banks
and other secular enterprises, and also
"to establish estates and residences for
the church leaders and their favorites."
which action, the plaintiffs aver, is in
violation of his trust, prays the court
to declare the legal duty of President
Smith with respect to the tithing and
other funds intrusted to his care, and
the purposes for which they may be
used. A temporary injunction is asked
for to restrain the church and its
president from investing the tithing
funds and other church money in any
business enterprise for profit, to be fol
lowed by a permanent injunction after
final hearing.
The Mormon church is Incorporated
under the laws of Utah.
Smurthwaite was recently excommu
nicated, but took an appeal from the
decision, so that he is still a member of
the church. He will undoubtedly lose
his appeal, as under the church rules
of procedure his case will not be again
considered on its merits.
Independent Mormons have lately
been strong in their criticism of Smith's
commercial policy, charging that he has
threatened with divine wrath members
of the church who engaged in competi
tion with enterprises In which Smith
is interested. Smith has visited his
displeasure on two men, Smurthwaite
and former Senator Cannon, who pub
licly criticized him, by causing their
excommunication.
The present suit may result In an In
vestigation and accounting of the
church funds. Up to this time the lead
ers of the church have never furnished
a statement as to the disposition of the
money received by them.

POLICE CLASH
WITH STRIKERS
CHICAGO, April 7.â Chicago is again
in the throes of a struggle between
capital and labor unions. As on former
occasions the unions have resorted to
the use of the union teamsters to bring
them victory in the struggle, which
to-night promises to spread to many
branches of the teaming industry of
Chicago.
The present struggle had its begin
ning in a strike several months ago
of a few hundred garment workers
employed by the mail order house of
Montgomery Ward & Co. The closed
shop Is the issue and in order to bring
the firm to the terms of the union a
strike of the 200 drivers and teamsters
employed by the concern was called to
day.
As has always been the case in the
past when the teamsters were called
on to assist hy a sympathetic strike.
the downtown streets of Chicago to
day were scenes of disorders which fol
lowed fast on each other when an at
tempt was made to deliver goods with
non-nnion drivers. Many teamsters,
garment workers and their friends
filled the streets, and many clashes
with the police occurred. In several
instances it was necessary for the po
lice to arrest a number of the belliger
ents before the blockades could be
lifted.

VIENNA, April 7.â The Neve Frele
Presse, to-day, commenting on the
toasts exchanged by King Victor Em
manuel and Emperor William at the
banquet at Naples yesterday, In a
calmly worded editorial, calls attention
to the fact that Emperor William re
ferred to the triple alliance as a strong
guarantee of peace, and says:
"King Victor Emmanuel spoke
strongly and sincerely In the same
general terms, but referred to only two
powers, Italy and Germany. Each
monarch knew what the other would
say before the toasts were uttered and
consequently each of the monarchs
meant a different alliance when he
spoke."
The fact that King Victor Em
manuel avoided referring to Austria

Investors Among Victims of Storey Cotton Company
PHIUVDELPHIA, April 7.âExamin
ation of the books and papers of the
defunct Storey Cotton Company, in
the hands of a receiver. has
brought to light a report of F. K. Lam
bert, manager of the Liverpool branch
of the company, that the company
owed JSBO.OOO to English investors.
There is r.v record of any part of this
amount having been paid.
The investigation also developed the
fact that numerous checks drawn by
the Storey Cotton Company to its own
wirder had been converted into cash at
various banks. These checks, it is
charged, represent money paid to the
pany by individuals who Invested.
The sum of $32,000, the books show,
was drawn from banks by General
Manager Howard. Checks were also
found varying in amounts from 51000
to $5000 made out to Sophia Beck, who
gp an employe of the Provident In
vestment Bureau was known as "Miss j
<"ullins." This helps to substantiate the j
belief that Sophia Beck, when she dis
nppeared. took with her a large sum
representing money intrusted to the
bureau for investment.
Women played a conspicuous part
in the Storey swindle and its allied
frauds. Sophia Beck, who Is being
industriously searched for by the po
lite, as it is known that she had a
large Ttioa of the funds of the con
cern with hr-r when she fled, drew a
palary of JSOO a week from the com
pany hilÂ« It was doing business. She
ied a riotous life when away from
the office and soon earned for herself
the title of "the woman with money to
burn." Â£he had a strong hold on the
officials of the Storey company and
twisted them about her fingers at her
will. After several matrimonial ven
tures that did not turn out to suit her,
Richard Graham, the son of a highly
respected widow of Jenkintown, fell as
her next prey. Graham had been driv
ing a wagon for his brother, who was
in the feed business. After a short
courtship in which 6he played the lead

LYNN, Mass., April 7.â Shortly after
the beginning of the autopsy on the
body of David K. Phillips, the wealthy
banker of SwampscoU, which was
found on the beach there yesterday,

TERROR SPREAD
BY WILD MAN
LAWTON, O. T., April 7.â A wild
man, of hideous appearance, with
ragged garments, emaciated features
and lacerated body, has for the past
two weeks been terrorizing the citi
zens of the southern and southwestern
portions of the Chickasaw nation, In
dian Territory. On several occasions
he has assaulted women and children
and injured men who sought to capture
him. He invariably makes his escape
and shortly turns up in some other
section of the country and renews his
operations.
Two deputy United States Marshals
and a posse of citizens recently came
in touch with him in a heavy thicket,
but he made good his escape. All sub
sequent efforts to capture him have
been futile. No one knows his name
or where he comes from.

DEATH RATHER
THAN DIVORCE
â i â 
Joseph Homolka, Former San
Francjscan, Takes His Life
Because of Domestic Woe
SEQUEL TO ELOPEMENT
His Child Bride Soon Tires
of Him and the Separa
tion Proves Unendurable
Special Dispatch to Th* Call.
ST. LOUIS, April 7.â Love for his
girl wife and the fear that she would
leave him caused Joseph Homolka to
commit suicide by asphyxiation to
day at his father-in-law's home. The
â¢ tragedy followed a partial reconcilia
tion between husband and wife. He
agreed to allow her to get a divorce,
as she had refused to live with Rim
again.
The Homolkas were married in Buf- '
falo, N. V.. whither they eloped dur
ing the Pan-American Exposition,
when Mrs. Homolka, who was then
Freda Lang, was a girl of 15. They
went to California on a honeymoon,
and later Homolka engaged in the sa
loon business in San Francisco. The
young bride soon became dissatisfied
and left her husband. He gave up his
new enterprise and followed her over
the country, trying to induce her to
come back. Five months ago she dis
appeared and nothing was heard of her
until two months afterward, when it
was learned that she was with rela- i
tives in Germany.
A month later her father met her
in New York City and brought her
back to St. Louis. He says he knew
she was dissatisfied, and he was trying
to establish Homolka in business in
San Francisco with a view to affecting
a reconciliation.
DUNNE SPEAKS
AT NEW YORK
NEW YORK, April 7.â Fresh from
his triumph in the recent municipal
election, Edward E. Dunne, Mayor
elect of Chicago, to-night addressed a
latge meeting in Cooper Union under
the auspices of the Municipal Owner
ship League of New York City. He
told how he expected to carry out his
pledges made in his recent campaign in
Chicago to attain municipal ownership,
of the benefits, as he conceived them,
of city control of public utilities and '
congratulated the local league on being j
pioneers In the movement in New j
York.
In concluding his speech Judge '
Dunne said:
"The movement in favor of municipal |
ownership of all public utilities has :
taken deep root among the intelligent
people of this country. It Is no passing I
sentiment. It is here to stay. Munici- :
pal ownership and operation of these j
utilities and governmental ownership ;
of railways, telegraphs and express j
transportation is a practical question i
upon which the people must pass with
in a very short time, and the politicians
and parties who Ignore this sentiment j
must be prepared for a short lived ca- '
rcer before the people."
HAWAII TO HAVE
TRUST INQUIRY
HONOLULU, April I.â Private ad
vices from Washington are to the effect
that the Attorney General of the United
States has concluded to take a hand in

tions that are commonly reported to
have been entered into by firms and
corporations here can be properly
classed as "combinations In restraint of
trade" under the provisions of the
Sherman law.

* The rapid growth of our business has no
as parallel in the history of merchandising in the

8 to be the largest store of our kind west of Chicago.
H We have seven departments devoted to men's and

X our fast-growing business. We require a second
H store, which will be opened April 15th in the
H James Flood Building, at the corner of Powell B

H to satisfy our numerous patrons.
*/ Do you know why we have grown ? Do you
H know that there is a reason behind all this cxpan-
& sion? Yes, and the strongest kind of a reason: *
j* We sell direct to the public and positively
j| save them at least twenty-five per cent.
jjjjj Stepping into our store is just like entering a
H manufacturing establishment and buying at whole-

'â p that has started the tide of public favor in our

OAKLAND, April 7.â AÂ« battle be
tween the oystermen may be expected
at any moment. According to a peti
tion for a temporary injunction filed
by the Darbee &. Immel Oyster Com
pany to-day, a move on the part of the
mercenaries of the Smith Oyster Com
pany means bloodshed. Both forces
are Intrenched on islands built on pil
ing, within easy rilie range, and are
waiting for a pretense to begin the at
tack.
To put itself upon the side of law
and order the Darbee & Immel Com
pany to-day asked for and obtained an
injunction from Judge Hall prevent
ing the Smith Company employes from
interfering with its operations: but
according to Attorney Louis Goldstone,
action or no injunction, neither
side will call away its force, and any
demonstration will precipitate trouble.
The hearing ot the writ has been 6et
for April 21. and it involves the title
to some 40"0 acres of land favorable
for the propagation of oysters. Both
: anies lay claim to the title, and
a short time ago the Smith oyster
men cut down the piling under the
buildings of the Darbee people and
floated them away on the tide. The pil
ing, however, has been replaced, and
both sides are established on the scene
perations, some two miles from
shore.
FINDS FAULT WITH UNIFORMS.
BERKELEY, April 7. â The mili
uniforms worn by freshmen at
the State University have incurred
the disapproval of Captain J. T.
Nance, military instructor. His dis
content with them is expected to open
uji anew a question agitated before,
that of thÂ«^ compulsory purchase by
:iipd of uniforms from a con
tracting tailor who has held the con
of protests from both
1 out of the university, for many
years.
I .am Nance, who always has re
iss his plans with respect
to improvements in the military de
partment, insisting that his reports
and recommendations must first go to
President Wheeler, now declines" to
admit that he has recommended an
ugation of the entire military
uniform question. But members of
ass, who listened to-day to his
diatribes against their uniforms and |
his explanation that followed took it
for granted that Nance purposes sift
ing to the bottom the process by
which uniforms that he terms "im
possible" are given to the freshmen
Xt a figure which is supposed to be
nominal, but which students say is
exorbitant.
Nance assured his freshmen that
their uniforms did not fit; that they
never would pass muster at the hands
of United States army officers, and
that they were not at all suitable to
military standards.

EARTH IS SINKING,
SAYS A SCIENTIST
Region About San Francisco Has Subsided
Four Feet in Recent Times.
University of California Savant Thinks That
All Will Go Under Gradually.
BERKELEY, April B.â Scientists of
the University of California express
deep interest in an important bulletin
issued to-day by the university author
ities, being the product of Vance C.
Osmont's researches in the coast
ranges north of the bay of San Fran
cisco.
The announcement is made by the
author of the bulletin that the bay re
gion is subsiding at an appreciable
rate constantly,, there being proofs in
evidence that show a submergence of
four feet In very recent times.
It is inferred by the scientist in ques
, tion that gradually this region will
1 sink, so that the future may hold in
6tore for dwellers in the bay region a
series of experiences of more than
passing Interest. Discussing this mat-
I ter, Mr. Osmond says:
I The recent subsidence which has affected thiÂ«
| regrion is well illustrated at the mouths of all
"f the streams flowing into the ocean and the
bay. Russian Klver, Salmon Creek, the Este
ros Americano and San Antonio, and Drakes
Hay at their mouths are wide, fiord-like bodies
of water with very precipitous shores, while
the streams such as Petaluma. Creek and N'apa
Creek are mere sloughs in their lower limits,
meanerin^ throug-h bread, tlat tule lan i bor
dered by steep hillsides. That they represent
a submerged area is apparent to the casual
(rlance. Certain evidence exists to show that
the submergence is going en at the present
time in the vicinity of San Francisco Bay.
' In recent â¢'xcavations made at Shell Mound
Fark, between â  Berkeley and Oakland, it was
found that the base of the snell beds are now
four feet below the ordinary high tide mark.
Since it Is evident that the mcund is a "kitch
en-midden," and therefore built on the land,
this fact proves that there has been in very
recent times a subsidence of at least four feet.
The topography of this section then may be
placed at a somewhat advanced stage In the
geombrphle cycle, and. since this cycle must
have been Inaugurated not earlier than the
beginning of the Pleistocrne. the observer Is
immediately impressed with the enormous
amount of ero6ion which has taken place, and
the vast space of time represented by this the
most recent period of geological history.
After the intrusion of the pre-Franclscan
strata by thÂ» granites a great period of erosion
occurred, as shown by the great unconformity
existing between Franciscan and the older
rocks.
Upon this old, well worn surface the Fran
ciscan F*ri<'s was laid down, the variety of the
=<>diments giving evidence of frequent oscilla
tions during their deposition, while the sharp
folding and faulting that nas taken place and
the volcanic intrusions attest the immense
amountof movement subsequent to their depo
sition.
During the Shasta-Chlco times probably the
whole of this area was deep under the sea and
the Sierras were undergoing erosion, for lying
unconformably upon the Franciscan, as shown
in many places outside of this field and sug
geFted by the heavy chert conglomerate of Ca
l.ay Valley. is i vast, accumulation of â¢ thin
bedded shaies 'and sandstones in monotonous
rhymical succession, indicating deep water
deposition under certain peculiar and as yr-t
unexplained conditions. â  At the most conserva
tive estimate tbe Shasta-Chlco strata in this
territory have a thickness of five miles, an<l
they are probably considerably j thicker than
this. ' â¢ ' " â¢'. â ;â ] f-^i':.

AS PRESIDENT
OAKLAND, April 7.â The Board of
Public Works and the Board of Police
and Fire Commissioners were reor
ganized this afternoon by the election
of Mayor Frank K. Mott as president
of each board. City Engineer Turner

uty city treasurer.

SUICIDE ENDS
LIFE OF CRIME
Special Dispatch to The Call
POPLAR, lowa, April 17.â A triple
funeral in this village to-day, at which
M. Nelson and his two little daughters
were buried, ended, it is hoped, the long
nightmare of crimes that has followed
the murder of Frank P. Richardson
seven years ago. Nelson has always
been supposed to have murdered Rich
ardson and he is believed to have killed
hU first wife. He murdered another
man in order that he might marry the
widow; drove his second wife away
with a threat of death; murdered his
two children, tried to kill his father
and mother, and then blew out his own
brains. Danny Westrope and Christian
Ebert were suspected of being accom
plices in the Richardson murder. West
rope drowned himself four years ago
and Ebert disappeared just as Rich
ardson did. It is believed Nelson mur
dered him.
Nelson stabbed his two children to
death and later when his father and
mother called on him and asked where
they were he gave them an overdose of
strychnine in coffee which fortunately
only made them sick. He afterwards
committed suicide. He left a note to
his parents, asking for forgiveness,
saying he could not help It.

EATS A FATAL
DISH OF BEANS
Infant Dies From the Effect
of Ptomaine Poison Con
tained in Canned Edibles
OTHERS NOT AFFECTED
Family Partakes of the
Succulent Vegetable, but
Only the Baby Succumbs
OAKLAND, April 7.â Ptomaine pois
oning from eating canned string beans
is ascribed as the cause of death in
the case of Mary Esther Greenwood, 2
years old, the daughter of Mr. and
Mrs. J. B. Greenwood, 828 Thirty-fifth
street, whose demise yesterday was
reported to-day to Coroner Mehrmarin.
The family ate the beans Wednes
day. Some were given to the baby,
who soon afterward became very ill.
Physicians were called, but could not
relieve the infant. Others of the fam
ily who partook of the vegetable were
unaffected, but this is said by the doc
tors to have been due to the fact that
they were older and better able to
withstand the effects of the poison.

its kind in California. Sell was 73
years old and a native of Pennsylvania.
He is survived by a widow, now a

he had lived apart for some years. His
funeral will be held to-morrow after
noon at 2 o'clock from the First Pres

Special Dispatch to The Call.
TACOMA, April 7.â Mrs. Elizabeth
Nolan of Chicago has arrived here to
contest the will of James M. Nolan,

desertion and that by the decree she
was deprived of all interest in the
property left by Nolan in Tacoma and
Port Angeles.
Nolan willed his property to Miss

with her mother, received Nolan's $2000
life insurance. In order to establish
her right to a portion of the estate,
Mrs. Nolan has started a suit to set
aside the divorce alleging that it waa

SAN JOSE, Ajsril 7. â Professor John
J. Montgomery of Santa Clara College,
the inventor of the aeroplane that
promises to -â¢ revolutionize aerial navi
gation, to-day filed a suit against T.
S. Baldwin, the well-known aeronaut,
for $100,000 damages for violation of ;â  a

and for a perpetual injunction prevent
ing Baldwin fiym constructing and
further exhibiting ' airships of the Ar

â ' r - In'the damage suit Professor Mont

Baldwin in which a partnership was
formed for the purpose of giving public
exhibitions , for profit of a contrivance
to be invented by the plaintiff for glid
ing and soaring through the air with
out the aid of gas. It was agreed that
Baldwin was to act in the ; dual, role
of agent and partner; that as partners
both were to contribute all their
knowledge and experience for the pur

partnership, and that the defendant as
agent was to account 'to the partner
bhlp j for all the moneys received for
such public exhibitions and to pay to

the police believe they have in custody
the miscreant who threw pepper in a
San Bernardino police officer's eyes
last Tuesday after the officer had
placed him under arrest.
Wilson was arrested this afternoon

his pocket, pulled out a handful of pep
per and threw it in the officer's eyes.
Farwell was completely blinded for a

the pepper out of his eyes to enable
him to see and started in pursuit of
his escaping prisoner. Wilson was soon
overtaken and thrown to the ground

LUN'DON, April 7.â Shakespeare's fa
mous dictum will have to be altered.
Ueresifter it must run â and some men
achieve greatness by getting â¢'convert
ed." Quentin Ashlyn. hitherto a -so
Â«-iety entertainer" Â«f no particular con
pequencfc, has become something like a
national figure by the simple means of
â¢ rinding the Lord."
Affciyn. whose line Is "refined" va
riety business, has for the last few
weeks been appearing at a certain
West End hall as a singer, "racon
teur," and so forth. There is no evi
dence to show that he wa* coining
montj'. One afternoon last week he
happened to stray into th' Albert Hall,
where Torrey and Alexander, the
American evangelists, are holding mon
ster revival meetings. A day or two
alterward it was announced that the
performer, having beccrme converted,
had given up his former calling and
canceled all his engagements. He had
no other means of subsistence, it was
explained, but trusted the Lord to
"provide." Here is the story of his
"conversion" in Ashlyn's own words:
AS TOLD BY THE A<TOR.
It rame about this way. Last Fri
day afternoon, aft^Â»- a game of bil
liards, a friend of mine asked me to go
with him to the King* Theater, Ham
mersmith. We found it wae full, so we
parted, and I was going past Albert
Hall on an orrnibus when it occurred
fr me to go in.
"I did k>o, a!-d heard Dr. Torrey
preach. I felt deeply impressed, but I
was not converted, and gave my
'sketch' as usual in the evening. Yet
T felt sick of the business.
I went to Albert Hall again, and on
ght at home I read Dr. Tor-
I'Pmphlet en the Day of Judg-
That settled it. I determined
that I must serve the Almighty, and I
went to the meeting on Tuesday and
tuld Dr. Torrey. 1 felt 1 <<-uld not go
<>n ying the fool in order to enter
tain other people. 1 had done with
sketches, and theaters, and billiards,
and things of that kind."
So on the following evening instead
of giving his usual entertainment, Ash
lyn testified to his conversic-n. At ffrsl
the audience laughed, thinking it wa*
ail â It af the programme, but when
they became convinced that the enter
tainer was rn' earnest they heard him
out and applauded. Since then Ash

havp Wn straight revival meetings
and attended by folk who want to hear
from his own lips just how the erst
wliile entertainer was "saved."
"I have no plan for the future," he
said the other day, "1 am trusting in
God to pro-vide me with some other
form of livelihood. People ask me
what I Phall do. I tell them that if
I can rely upon God in the hereafter I
can rely upon him now."
NOW ATTRACTS CROWDS.
It !p possible that Ashlyn is absolute
ly Â«in<-er*\ bat it is a fact that whereas
his ordinary performances seldom, if
ever, made the S. R. O. sign necessary,
WL O'-'rge'R Hall will scarcely hold the
folk who want t<> see and hear the
"( -mverted entertainer." His fame has
spread from Lands End to John o'
Groats. Admission to Ashlyn's revival
meetings is free, but a big collection is
taken up every night. Ashlyn declares
that he gets not a penny of this. It is
understood, however, that every mail
brings the converted entertainer more
or less handsome donations from good
folk who wish to demonstrate to him
that he has made no mistake in trust
ing the Almiphty "to provide."
A few day? after the entertainer
"found Christ," as he expresses it, the
following amusing letter appeared In
a London daily journal. It was writ
ten by Miss Frances Kapstowne:
"With regard to the 'conversion 1 of
Quentin Ashlyn, the papers have
omitted to mention that he is the man
ager of a party of three girls called
"The Puritan Maidens.' I am one of
these, and although we should not
have been permitted to leave his party
without due notice, he now tells us at
a minute's notice that he is leaving the
profession.
"I. In my un-Christlafn way, refused
several good offers, as I believed my
self to be under some obligation to
Mr. Ashlyn. I see now that the cor
rect thing to have done was to leave
him in the lurch. In future contracts
should have a new clause, namely,
'In case of manager's "conversion,"
all tours to be considered canceled.' "
TALK OF SACRED PLAY.
Torrey and Alexander, however, ex
press themselves as delighted with
their histrionic convert.
"There have, however." said the
former, "been quite a number of con
vereions among actors, and quite a
vigorous crusade has been begun by
these men. One prominent actor tells
me that a determined effort la being
made from within to raise the tone of
the stage to a Christian standardâ
surely not a ridiculous thing to at
tempt In a Christian country!"
The American evangelist added the
surprising information that a start
would be made soon with a sacred
play with converted actors, but he
could not yet permit publicity to be
given to the title of the play.

SCHMITZ TAKES
NEW POSITION
3layor's Brother Is Elected
Secretary of the Board
of Park Commissioners
GREAT HIGHWAY LINE
Signs of a Scheme to Wrest
From the Public Lands Set
Apart for Pleasure Ground
The Board of Park Commissioners at
a meeting in the Palace Hotel yester
day afternoon accepted the resignation
of James de Succa, secretary, and elect
ed in his place Herbert Schmitz, broth
er of the Mayor. The Commissioners
attending were: Keuben H. LÂ»loj\l.
Earl Curnming*. William J. Dingoe and
William H. ftfetsoa, the last named
presiding. The president, A. B. Spreck
els, was out of iovwi.
When the last document on the file
of business was taken up Secretary de
Succa remarked with some emotion
that the last was the saddest, and
thereupon read his own resignation to
take effect April 15. Commissioner
liloyd moved its acceptance, praising
the faithful service rendered by Mr. de
Succa. Similar repressions of good will
came from other Commissioners and a
vot*. of thanks was given to the retiring
secretary.
On motion of Commissioner Lloyd,
seconded by Commissioner Dingee,
Herbert Schmitz was elected secretary
by a unanimous vote. De Succa will
be appointed storekeeper for the Board
of P'ducation. The salary attaching to
th*- park secretaryship is $175 a month.
The pay of storekeeper is $150 a month.
Yfsterday torenoon the retiring sec
retary was informed of the Mayor's
wishes, but was unable to control his
emotions of grief when the time came
for obeying the decree.
Custom accords to the Mayor the
privilege of naming the secretary of
the Park Commission, and the mem
bers of the board yesterday with some
alacrity recognized the desires of the
executive. Two years ago Herbert
Schmitz resigned the office to which he
was elected yesterday to accept a place
on the Board of Public Works. Sub
sequently he was slated for the office
of Police Commissioner, but some
thing happened to cause a revision of
the programme.
Commissioner Lloyd called the
board's attention to the original line of
the Great Highway as established by
ordinance 800 in 1867. The line is 200
feet from highwater mark of 1846. Ad
herence to the original lines will place
under the control of the commission a
quarter of an acre of land near tfye
Cliff House, which is now occupied
and jointly claimed by the city and
R. M. Hotalinp. The lines recognized
by the City Engineer do not place the
land within the park domain.
Yesterday the Coi. missioners resolved
to contend for the rights of the park
as against the city and other claim
ants.
Charles A. Lambert offered to pro
cure for the park from Alaska three
young moose and four mountain sheep
at $150 each. Commissioners Lloyd,
Dingee and Metson each agreed to con
tribute $150 to the fund for purchas
ing the real and true Big Horn moun
tain cheep. Lambert asked the board
to get a permit from the United States j
Commissioner of Agriculture to au
thorize him to kill mother sheep in

SUTTER COUNTY TULE LANDS
OF MUCH INTEREST TO MINERS
Prospecting of Old Channels Goes
Forward With Successful Result
Law to Prey nt Faking Is Discussed
The present activity in the mining
industry in California goes far to ful
fill the many predictions of the past
as to great enterprises and operations
on a stupendous scale. The extension
of the dredge mining has been bo
much discussed lately that the pub
lic has ceased to wonder at any new
announcement. Not the least inter
esting gold find that is reported is
one in Sutter County. Mention has
already been made of the discoveries
In the tule lands of the county. A
long review of the facts is published
In the Sacramento Bee, in which some
<>f the leading statements are as fol
lows:
Assays of the Band show that it ia re
markably rich. aB some of it has assayed $40
a ton. Such immense gold-sand deposits right
in the center of the Sacramento Valley arÂ«
puzzling to the oldest miners. The deposits
are not unlike the beach deposits found on
the coast of Alaska in that the Band la found
in well defined channels that bear Â«very In
dication of once being an estuary of thÂ«
ocean or an old river channel. . In these
channels the sand Is found about seven feet
under the surface and lies In two strata.
Tlip first is about twelve feet in thickness,
tben clay is encountered for about six feet
and the black sand is again entered. The
second stratum varies in thickness from ten
to twenty fpet. The channels run In a zlg
sag course and arc estimated to be from 500
to 800 feet in width.
In Ausrust of last year, on the ranch of
Mrs. Ida F. Lee. located six miles west of
the little station of Tudor. In Sutter County,
a hired man on the ranch discovered thÂ« sand
In a shallow hoie. not more than eight leet
In depth, and. being somewhat of a miner,
pannpd it out in a crude manner and found
it to contain gold. A few days later the
proprietor of the ranch secured the services
of a well-borer and, near where the ranch
hand got his sand, sunk a well primarily to
get water for the stock and secondarily to
ascertain to what depth the gold-bearing: sand
extended.
Boring ceased at thirty-five feet and in
that distance two strata ot sand and one of
clay had b*en encountered. Both layers ot
sand contained much water. The sand waÂ»
tested in a rough way and all found to con
tain gold. In the early part of November
pome thirty holes were gunk on the ranch
of Mrs. Lee and the ranch of W. T. Phlppa,
which adjotm on the north, for the sole pur
pose of ascertaining the extent of this deposit.
Samples were taken at various depths from
these holes. None of the borings went farther
than the clay which underlies the first . layer
ol pand. This layer proved to be about fifteen
feet deep, on an average, and about 600 feet
wide, the channel forming a horseshoe on the
two ranches and extending along both sides
of the half-oectton of land. '
Some thirty tests were made during; No
vember and December by various assayers.
showing yields varying from (1 25 to $40 p^r
ton. When these reports were first made pub
lic their correctness was doubted, but when
the names of some of the assayers were made
known thÂ« doubting ceased.
No system of separating the gold from the
sand has been settled on and miner* differ
as to the process necessary. The reported
richness ot thesÂ» deposits Is too extravagant
to be given credence by those who have not
seen thp nss-ayers' reports.
Since the wells were sunk and tests madt
on the Lee $nd Phlpps ranches boring haÂ»
been carried on on a number of othac ranches*
near by. The latest find was two w*eks ago
when the report of the assays made of the
sand taken from the 70C>-acre ranch of John
Markley and associates showed $12 to the
ton. The Markley. ranch Is a few miles north
west of the. trat-t'Â» above deECribed and well
out into |Â»ie tule basin.
DISCI SSI KG NEW LAW.
The exclusive publication In The
Call concerning the intent of the min
ing legislation passed by the Califor
nia Legislature at its recent session
has excited a great deal of interest in
all mining sections of the State. The
Los Angeles Times says of this law
to head off mining fakers:
Whether this law will prove broad enough
and stringent enough to^serve the desired pur
pose can be determined only by the test of its
practical operation. That there. Is need for
pome surh law has long been apparent. Le
gitimate mining enterprises have long suf
fered severely from the operations of these fake
mining schemes, founded upon worthless claims
and often upon no claims save the mendacious
claims ct the. Hwindllng falters themselves. If
this law shall prove sufficient to put an end to
tho particular kln-i of swindling to which it re
fers It will accomplish a great and lasting
benefit.
From the text of the law it Is evident that
its application ib not restricted to mining cor
porations alone, but that it will apply with
equal force to any corporation based on fraud
end supported by misrepresentation. If the
language in which it Is couched may be taken
as any criterion, the law seems to be broad
enough to' cover a large number of swindling,
Tivoli Opera-House.
"Florodora." the most famous of all musical
comedies, will be produced for the first time
this Sunday night at popular prices at the
Tivoli. The story of the aspiring millionaire
and the scheming society widow, the stolen
secret for the making of the perfume and the
rightful heiress is familiar to all theatergoers,
as also are the entrancing tunes that have
been sung and whistled all over ths world.
There is every reason to believe the coming
production will he as popular a? any that have
preceded It. The same lavish expenditure of
money that made the original production of
this musical comedy the most costly ever
staged will be seen in the new costumes,
scenery and effects with which the manage
ment will dress this popular and successful
piece. The cast will be an exceptionally strong
one and will Include besides the entire Tivoli
company several new and clever people, among
whom will be Aida Hernmi. a renowned East
ern prima donna, who was prominently Identi
fied with the New York productions of "The
Knickerbocker Girl" and "The Jersey Lily."
and Walter Shannon, an excellent barytone.
One of the chief attractions of the piece will
be the "Beauty Sextet," romposed solely of
California girls, selected especially for their
grace, beauty and musical ability. They may
be relied upon to uphold the credit of thÂ«lr
native State and to fully equal, if not totally
eclipse the Eastern young women who first
took part in the catchy "Tell Me Pretty
Maiden Are There Any More At Home Like
You?" The production of "Florodora," It may
safely be predicted, will prove one of the
most enjoyable entertainment* of the season.

The Montezuma grroup of mines in
Shasta County has been sold by the
Connors to the Gold King Mining
Company. There are six claims in all.
The mining company is composed
largely of Los Angeles parties. Clin
ton Johnson is the president.
The Klamath River Dredge Mining
Company is preparing to operate on
a tract of 2100 acres extending in
land from the mouth of the Klamath
River.
The Redding Searchlight reports a
strike in the Reid mines near Red
ding. There are six claims Jn one
group under bond to D. B. Hunt and
James Sallee of San Francisco. Work
has been in progress some months.
The Marysville Gold Dredging Com- I
pany, the Marysville Democrat re- .
ports, will begin to construct two
mining dredgers this month, of the
type used on the Tuba Consolidated .
of Goldfleld district. W. P. Hammon |
will be the managing director of the
Marysville company. By the end of
the year six dredgers will be in oper
ation on the Yuba. Two are working,
two half completed and two new ones
have been contracted for. The Ham
mon company may construct other
machines this year.
The Blue Tent mine, owned by C. :
|L. Canfleld and P. C. Drescher and
situated on the South Yuba River, â 
six miles from Nevada City, is put
ting 200 tons of gravel a day through
the mill. The mine was formerly op
erated as a hydraulic property, but is
now a drift proposition.
The Redding Searchlight reports
that Deadwood, In Trinity County, Is
an active camp. A score of leasers
are operating and have met with good
returns. Rock ranging from $70 to
$600 a ton is reported to have been
found.
Nevada City is playing in luck. A
rich strike is reported in the Lecomp
ton mine. Recently a strike was made
at the Murchie. The resumption of
work at the Home mine also adds to
'the good outlook. The Lecompton
mine is in the Willow Valley district.
The ore was encountered in a cross
cut from the 400-foot level. Local pa
pers say that the strike is the most
important that has been made in the
Lecompton.
MINING IN PLACER,
The Placer County Republican has
the following about mining operations
in Placer County:
Gravel was struck In the Strawberry mlnÂ«
at Monona Flat, near lowa Hill. A boring
machine has beÂ«-n bnufrfct for the Hidden Treas
ure mine at Bullion, in order to draw off ihe
water which has given trounle while sinking
an Lozano 8t Bucnanan are going to
install electric power at the Bellevue mine in
the Ophir listrtrt and will run an air com
pressor and hoist and pump, also operating thÂ«
Burk'igh drills by air. Some fine ore has been
frtrurk in the shaft In the Water Dog mmÂ«,
where the water has been giving trouble. It 1b
mmored that the Kcllpse-Momlng Star may
start up soon with CMcago capital. The Qulen
Sabe mmÂ«, near WestvlHe, a deal for which
was reported a couple of weeks ago, was not
sold, and Peter Hlnst now holds the controlling
Interest. He also has two claims which he in
tends to open in the spring. The Tadpole Com
pany at Secret House has 2(3 claims in one
group. It ran a 250- foot tunnel last fall and
has a 15 to 18 foot ledge. It is going to put
in a mill and air compressor and Burleigh
drills, which have bet-n Dought. At Sailor
Canyon work Is being done by three companies
who are hunting for channels.
The owners of the Scotts Flat gravel
diggings on Deer Creek, seven miles
from Nevada City, are planning to sink
for the blue gravel channel that is
supposed to underlie that section of
the country between Blue Tent and
Red Dog. The channel has never been
reached in this vicinity, although at
tempts have been made.
Some changes have been made re
cently in the ownership of mining
properties in Tuolumne County that
are reported by the Mother Lode Ban
ner:
C. Tatten has deeded to George A. Tatten
tie Golden Treasure, also known as the Old
Indian claim, situated on Knights Creek, near
the Bonrbon. By an agreement of even date
Tatten gives to William Danzlers a bond for a
deed to a half interest in the property. Moul
ton Harmon ha< deeded to A. M. Divoll an un
divided half interest in the Frisby Annex, an
extension of the Sell mine. David L. Oneto
has sold to H. P. Hale an undivided one-half
Interest In the Gold Flake quartz mine, situ
ated about three-quarters of a mile north of
the mouth of Mormon Crwk; also a one-half
Interest In the Gold Flaxe mill situ
Litigation, the Calaveras Prospect
reports, has caused work on the Cali
fornia placer mine to be stopped.
The Blue Ledge mines in the Elliott
and Joe Creek sections of Siskiyou
County, near the Oregon boundary,
will be sold at Sheriff's sale on April
24 at Yreka to satisfy a judgment upon
execution. In consequence of litiga
tion no work has been done lately on
the claim, hence the suit for sale of
the property in order that parties anx
ious to go on with operations may do
so by right of possession. .
OREGON QUICKSILVER.
The Oregon Mining Journal reports
that more attention is given to the pro
duction of quicksilver in Oregon than
at any previous time. In a review of
j the situation the Journal says in part:
The flattering showing made by recent re
torts of ores from the cinnabar mines of the
Meadcws quicksilver district of Jackaon Couny,
nfar Trail, has caused a revival of Interest In
the mining of mercury In this (Medford) sec
tion. Eighty pounds of mercury to the ton are
produced. A small plant has been erected, for
development purposes mainly. The retort has
a capacity of 1400 pounds of ore per day.
There are a half score of cinnabar mines In
the Meadows district, all of which are recelv
' ing attention, and all carry values in mercury,
) with also a fair showing in gold and silver.
Sevenl are opened to a depth of 150 and 200
teet. with veins varying in width from ten
inches to three and four feet. The number of
excellent prospects in the district makes the
Meadows one of promise as a future producer
of mercury.
The Arizona Legislature turned down
all bills before it that affected mining.
Among the rejected measures were
bills providing for mine inspection, for
j a tax on bullion and prohibiting the
' use of any form of evidences of in
debtedness in place of cash in payment
of wages.
In February the Copper Queen mine
at Blabee, Ariz., produced 7,012,000
pounds of copper.
An official estimate of the value of
Colorado's mineral production in 1904
places the total at $40,783,074. Of thlg
gold amounted in value to $24,000,000
in round figures: silver, $7,400,000;
lead, $4,600,000; copper, $1,200,000;
xinc, $3,300,000. The totals are based
on the average price of the several
metals In 1904. Of the total of $24,
000,000 in gold claimed for Colorado
one county, Teller, Is credited with an
output of $14,456,000
BISHOP DRAWS
ON PUGILISM
Dr. Hamilton, in Address in
New York, Sees Something
in Prizering- to Emulate
SPEAKS TO STUDENTS
San Franciscan Says That
Successful Preacher Must
Be a Man of the World
NEW YORK, April 7.â ln an address
to-day to the candidates for admission
into the Methodist ministry and the
New York conference. Bishop Hamil
ton of San Francisco, presiding officer
of the convention, said the successful
preacher must be a man of the world.
He warned the candidates not to both
er about heresy or become heresy
hunters, and deqlared that there was
too much philosophy and too little
Scripture in the study of doctrine. He
told them to give the man with the
hypothesis about the Bible the right
of way if he had the proper spirit, but
not to accept all they heard.
â¢'Above all." said the Bishop, "don't
preach it unless you know what you
are talking about. The Methodist
church does and is expected to furnish
the gospel for all other churches. "
In recommending to the candidates
the admonition for fasting, the Bishop
intimated that certain acts of prise
fighters might be observed and emulat
ed with good results.
"Out where I live," said he, "men
who stand up and strike one another's
fares for $35,000 of gate receipts go
away for weeks before and take care of
thpir bodies so they can withstand the
strain of th<=> conflict."
Proving another a hypocrite does not
prove your holiness.

THE COMING SETTLERS.
BECAUSE it is close to us we all notice the increase of popula
tion in San Erancisco, and in the communities on the east
side of the bay. It is quite clear that at the present rate of in
crease the next census will show a half million of people in this city,
and nearly as many in Oakland and her associated towns.
But this accession of city population would be abnormal and of
little worth if it were not coincident with an equal increase in the
rural population. The reports of the various development associa
tions in the Sacramento and San Joaquin valleys give gratifying evi
dence that the country is keeping pace with the city. The breaking
up of large holdings is going on rapidly. Men from the East are
buying them at wholesale prices, and will get the benefit of the in
crement of value put upon the land by labor. The San Joaquin
Valley is building up towns by the increase in the rural population.
Bakersfield, Fresno and Stockton have coming companions, not ri
vals, in Tulare and Modesto. The irrigated district in Stanislaus
County, that was opened last May, is now thickly settled. Great es
tates have been cut into small holdings and the country has been
transformed from a dry and unpeopled plain to a rich and well settled
farming region.
In the Sacramento Valley the process begun at Chico is going
down the valley as by gravity. Chico has risen into importance and
is a town with an assured future. Marysville is no longer lonely, and
when Colusa County begins to move the old town of Colusa will be
set between the two.
In his last report to the State Board of Trade President Chipman
deprecated the propagation of the idea that fruit must be the main
rural industry of the State. We are learning something from the
Eastern farmers who are flocking here to buy land. They are va
riety farmers. Within the limitation of the Eastern climate they pro
duced every crop that was possible. They bring this habit to Cali
fornia, and it is a needed habit. Eastern men worked out changes
of vast import to Southern California, mainly in business lines not
immediately related to the soil. The Eastern farmers are to bring a
change to the agricultural section of the State of the greatest im
portance. Already their advent has raised the inquiry, "Why is not
held corn a crop in this State ?"
Corn is the great staple of the Middle West. The truth about
that great crop was told by Hon. Frank Landers of Indianapolis,
when a mass meeting was held to protest against the smell of his
pork packery. When asked to say something in his own defense,
Landers said: "What made the State of Indiana? Hogs and corn.
What built this opera-house, made Indianapolis, bought the pictures
in Ben Harrison's house, brought railroads here, and made for
tunes for the fellers who abuse my pork house? Hogs and corn. Any
Hoosier who can't stand the smell of packing pork ought to be ban
ished to a place where corn doesn't grow and hogs don't root." That
settled it. The meeting dissolved and pork packing went on.
Corn growing in California will solve the question of importing
pork products to California from the corn States. The Sacramento
Valley Development Association has taken the matter in hand and is
distributing seed corn for trial and experiment. Up to this time we
have fattened hogs on figs and grapes and finished them with barley.
It is a dogma with pork curers that only corn makes the best finished
product. In all the dairy districts in the corn States the by-products
of the dairy are used in hog raising and the finish is given with corn. :
We have here interrelated two matters of prime interest' to rural j
California. With alfalfa, the best milk ration known, and a dairy ;
climate, we still import more than a million a year of dairy products,
when we should export more than that. With hogs as a by-product
of dairying and corn to finish the pork, we would soon cease to im
port and would become exporters.
Fruit will always hold its own here and will increase with the
demand. But we cannot always go on raising fruit and importing
other products of the soil. The Eastern immigrants who are coming
will show us a novelty in the shape of cornfields. It is a crop that
requires only ninety days from planting to harvest, and if found
suitable it will suddenly revolutionize agriculture in our valleys. It
is an economic fact that the greater the variety of our products the
more useful is the variety of people we will attract. Corn is a crop
that should receive irrigation easily. The heat that will produce,
raisins from Glenn County to Kern will surely produce corn, and it is
as easily cultivated as an orchard after irrigation. A few good corn
raisers from Nebraska. Missouri and lowa could show all California
something worth a journey to see. The Agricultural Department at
Washington has sent experts into the corn States to teach improve
ment of the crop by selection of seed. It would no doubt send them
here, to teach our farmers the merits of the corn crop and methods of
its growth.
Diversified farming will draw population and add greatly to the
articles of commerce. It will increase the business of mechanics
and implement iecfers by a demand for tools not now in use. and will
?.']'": to the certainty of rural profits by the addition of new crops.
California will always remain the greatest fruit producing region of
the world. Nothing can rob us of that pre-eminence. Let us add the
vast variety of field crops that can be raised here, and the State will
be foremost in the production of all crops that can be raised anywhere
in the temperate zone, and they will grow alongside of the date,
orange, olive, fig and other semi-tropical crops that we have already
profitably domesticated.
THE PRESIDENT'S TOUR.
PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT has gone forth on a tour of recre
ation. He wisely chose to go South. Great interests are in
volved in a good understanding between the people of the
nth and those of the North. None can better promote that un
derstanding than the President. His visit to Louisville brought out
all Kentucky to meet him. The Governor did his duty as the host
of the President, and there was a sincere exchange of cordialities.
Since the Presidential party entered Texas that State has caught the
spirit of the occasion in the most hospitable way. If there .has been
anything lacking it has not been noticed.
The President has uttered himself frankly on all public issues
that may be properly discussed on such a trip, and so far not a man
in the South has voiced a disagreement with him. He has convinced
rlie South that he does not now, and never did, entertain a thought
of having one policy or view for one part of the country and a differ
ent policy or view for another part of the people.
No one doubts <he national aspiration of the Southern people.
They have seen prosperity spring from the ashes of their industrial
institutions. They plant and reap on the battlefields of the Civil
War. They have seen old political issues grow dim with time and
and fade away into history. They have seen the passing of
the old order and the coming of the new has brought to them secu
rity, comfort and riches. They cannot fail to connect this result
ith the political principles which have considered no one section,
and the party that has played no favorites in its economic policy.
They see in the President not a destroyer but a buildei*, not the
genius of ruin but the spirit of construction. So the natural man
in them greets its mate in him, and they are not only having a good
time together but are learning lessons to be wrought into the pros
perous and powerful future of the whole country. So mote it be.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, APRIL 8. 1005.
MATRIMONY FOR HER INSTEAD OF
NURSES' TRAINING SCHOOL NOW
THAT SHE HAS A FORTUNE.
rROM Wales had come the news to
Miss Sarah Anne Scott, a young
Englishwoman" that an uncle in
that country had left her a leg
acy of $25,000. Miss Scott was just re
turning to her home, 1226 North Fifty
second street, after taking the exam
inations preliminary to entering the
nurses' training school of the Univer
sity Hospital when she was told of her
good fortune.
In an attempt to find out just how it
feels to become the owner of that much
money unexpectedly Miss Scott was in
terviewed by a Philadelphia North
American man. The young woman is
not an analyst of emotions; neither was
she surprised at the bequest of her un
cle.
"No, indeed, it wasn't unexpected at
all," said she. "To be sure, I couldn't
spend ft before I got it, so I was going
to be a nurse and earn my living, but
it was always understood in the family
that my uncle would leave the money
to me. There is also a much larger
fortune that will probably be mine
some day.
"How shall I spend it? Likely for
house rent and bakers' and butchers'
bills and clothes and the various other
thing 3 that are needed to keep a young
woman alive and happy. Did you think
I should rush off and buy an automo
bile or a yacht?"
Mies Scott said that she should go to
Wales to receive her legacy and then
return to Philadelphia. "Fur this is the
only country in the world, and I am a
patriotic American," she declared.
Then, just to show that women's minds
run much in the same channel, wheth
er their owner's are wealthy or not, she
spoke wistfully of the affinity that she
hopes is seeking her somewhere in this
land of the brave.

the girl had an advantage over Amer- â 
ica in being able to look back at her i
discoverer out of two very wide-open
eyes.
"Thank you," she said to Columbus.
Then she looked down and her eyes
rested on the man's gloved hand, which
only partly covered the ivory handle J
of an umbrella. He remembered the j
hole In his glove and snatched it away [
to iiide.it in his pocket. Before he â 
could catch the umbrella in his other!
hand it fell against the girl's knee.
She grasped it firmly with both her
small hands.
"Thank you, " she said again, raising
her eyes for a brief instant to the
man's face.
Columbus stared. "Pardon me, but I
why?" he asked, observing the delicate j
color rising in the girl's cheek.
She did not answer, but her eyes
were bent lovingly on the umbrella
handle. It was one her grandfather
had given her when she was 16 and
she had worn out four silk covers on
it. She was glad the man did not in
sist on an immediate answer. What
must he think of her? After a minute
she looked up.
"Why do you thank me?" the man
asked, in a dazed but very low tone.
"For my umbrella," she answered,
still holding it firmly.
"Iâ l beg your pardon, Miss "
"No; I am not misâ taken," she said,
her sense of humor coming to her as
sistance. She held out the umbrella
handle for him to examine.
"Do you see those three wrinkles in
the dog-s brow?" she asked, with the
littlest smile in the world. "I carved
them there myself to show how wor
ried he had grown trying to take care
of me."
He looked at the lines across the
dog's ivory brow. "I didn't know a
girlâ" he began, but broke off. The
girl .liked him better for his hesitation
to talk â he seemed to understand the
fitness of things.
"Where did you lose it?" he asked,
after a moment.
"Where you found it," she replied.
"Did you take it to the lost property
office of the streetcar company and
leave it there for me?" he asked, with
a touch of triumph in his voice.
"I did not know there was such a
place," she exclaimed.
"Well, I paid 21 cents for it at an
auction of unclaimed goods last week,"
informed the man.
The girl opened a tiny purse.
"You can't buy it, if that's your in
tention," he said firmly, but deferen
tially.
"Seventy-second street," cried the
conductor. The girl rose hastily and
rushed toward the door, leaving: the
umbrella behind. Columbus followed,
with the bone of contention under his
arm.
In the street the girl stood and
looked at him. It was beginning to
rain.
"The rain falls on the Just," the man i
said, glancing down at himself, "and
â  on the unjust," he added, looking her
squarely in the eyes. "I shall put the
umbrella over us both."

The Bible miracle of the walls of Jer

around them a certain number of
times, sounding their trumpets, found
a repetition the other day at Heiligen

organizing a brass band, had gathered
his musicians for practice in his gar
den, situated at the foot of the an
cient walls of the city.
One day last week while the trum
pets were doing their best on a high
note the city wall fell without warn
ing, scattering the terrified musicians
all over the meadows.
It is said that a combination ot notes
caused the ruin of the walls, just as

At the foot of a flight of stone steps

"Let me pay you the 21 cents â

T\'hen her husband died Mrs. Ange

physically incapable of performing all
the functions pertaining to the job she
enlisted St. Clair Moore, young, able

him arrested on the charge of embez

Patrolman Dow, who is strenuously
endeavoring to make the Ocean Beach
an undesirable loafing place for shady
characters, told Judge Conlan that
Miss Carrie Vierra, young, petite and
pretty, seemed to be a magnet for the
military. The girl had spent many aft
ernoons within sound of the breakers,
the officer said, and soldiers hovered
near her as moths flutter around a
lantern. When asked why she dawdled
away her time by the sea Miss Vierra
either could not or would not give
satisfactory answer, *o she was arrest
ed and booked for vagrancy. In the
court of Judge Conlan, however, she
indignantly challenged the officer to
prove his accusation, but her Inabil
ity to disprove it resulted in convic
tion and she was ordered to appear
for sentence to-day.
"If these sodgers," she said, "have
nothing else to do than rubber after
me I'm sure it ain't my fault."
Mrs. Edward Lynch and her offspring
were debarred from entering their
home at 264 Jessie street by the recum
bent form of William Cooper, young,
bulky and drunk, blocking the front
door. He not only declined to move,
but roughly resented Mrs. Lynch's pro
posal that she climb orer him, al
though she told him that her dinner
was being burned to a crisp on the
kitchen range, as he could ascertain
for himself by sniffing â the odor of
charring meat and vegetables being
sufficiently pungent to nauseate the ol
factories of any person not possessing
a cold in the head who was within a
one-block radius of the dwelling. She
was almost ready to weep over the
ruin of the meal she had taken such
pains to prepare, to say nothing of the
anguish occasioned by the reflection
that her spouse would soon arrive home
to find his dinner a crisp, when Mr.
Lynch himself appeared on the scene.
His wife's indignantly delivered re
countal of the situation instantly re
etrlved him to action. Seizing the hu
man obstacle with a firm grasp he
swung it to the roadway and then ac
companied his family to the culinary
department, where their worst fears
were realized. The dinner was abso
lutely uneatable. While they were haÃ
tiiy preparing a makeshift substitute
a heavy stone crashed through the win
dow, struck the stove and severely
fractured it. Hushing to the street
Mr. Lynch found Mr. Cooper indus
triously sotking another bowlder, with
evid-nt intent to hurl it also through
the damaged casement, and in the en
suing struggle Mr. Lynch won all the
honors, the climax jjeing Mr. Cooper's
arrest on the charge of malicious mis
chief. Judge Mogan will hear more of
the details this morning.

Privates George "\V. Tillery and W. |
E. Tribble, Ninth Battery, United I
States Artillery, were demolishing the
Japanese patent medicine emporium of
T. Mori Gomei Kalsha at 627 Dupont
street T*hen a policeman arrested them
for malicious mischief. In the court of
Judge Mogan it was told that Private
Tillery had been taking a course of
"jag^ cure " treatment from T. M. Q.
Kaisha, which failed of desired effect,
and that when he demanded return of
tru money he had spent for medicine,
alleged to consist largely of desiccated
owls' eyeballs and pulverized puckers
of the octopus, he was refused, where
upon he became angered and started to j
break things, Private Tribble aiding
him in the endeavor. The soldiers two
promised to pay for all they broke and
the Juuge dismissed them.
When th<Â» case of "Zick" Abrams and j
ten others, accused of violating the
anti-poolronm ordinance, was called be- >
fore Judge Mogan the prosecuting at- ;
torney moved for and was granted an
other mntinuanre till next Monday,
his stated object being- to ascertain ir
Ahi ams cannot be charged with "keep-
Ing a rir)"Iroom"r ir) "Iroom" instead of "being an
Inmate of a poolroom." One of the d^
f^niantÃ. I>aniel Creighton, alleged to
have been the cashier of the establish
ment raided on O'Farrell street, is
formally accused of "selling a pool."
and the other nine are charged with
"viFitlng a poolroom." The police say
Abrams owned the place, but there ap
pears to be such difficulty in proving
its ownership that the Judge desires to
have the prosecution conducted by Dis
trict Attorney Byingrton in person.
For attempting to murder T. Yonzo
by stabbing him, Kynzahurl Nakamori,
a son of Nippon, was committed by
Judge Mogan to Ktand trial in the Su

Judge Henry A. Melvin of Oakland
and the Rev. I. Curtis Meserve, D. D.,
spoke last night before the British

Judge Melvin's topic was "The Civil

ment Toward the Mother Land," an,d
Dr. Meserve those for his theme,
"Some Anglo-American Cross Lights."
Both reviewed the past and the
present relations between the United
States and Great Britain, referring in
happy vein to the friendship which
â exists between the "mother and
daughter."
Judge Melvin said that no longer
did the orator prate, nor the journal
ist write of the national unworth of
those on the other side of the water.
There was criticism, of course, but for
the most part it was dignified and ra
tional.

URGE REPEAL
OF ORDINANCE
Unions Claim Law Prohibit
ing Disturbance of Funer
als Is Very Much Abused
RESENT UNJUST ARREST
Citizens' Alliance and Hack
men to Submit New Meas
ure* to > the Supervisors
The Supervisors' Joint Judiciary and
Police Committee yesterday considered
the petitions of the Hackmen's Union
and Brotherhood of Teamsters for the
repeal of the ordinance prohibiting in
terference with processions or fu
nerals.
Michael Coffey, president of the
Hackmen's Union, stated that advan
tage of the ordinance had been taking
by causing the arrest of a union hack
man who refused to drive in a funeral
line with a non-union driver and the
case was fought at a considerable ex
pense. Coffey said a union hearse
driver was arrested by the Citizens' Al
liance on the ground that he dis
turbed the funeral. A jury acquitted
the dniver because it was not proved
that he had refused to drive in line
and had thrown his lines on his horses'
backe, as the prosecution claimed.
Coffey contended that the union hack
men never withdrew from a funeral
after it was formed.
Supervisor Comte held that the ob
ject of the ordinance is to stop dis
turbances at a funeral, which must be
regarded as a sacred affair and entitled
to respect.
"There should be decency on both
sides," said M. J. Casey of the Team
sters' Union. "The other side is seek
ing to provoke this disturbance. I
think there should be some legislation
to prevent disrespect for the dead, but
it should be fair to both sides."
Bush Finnell of the Citizens' Alli
ance suggested that the union and his
organization frame an ordinance
covering the point, but Casey said they
would never agree, so it was stipu
lated that each side submit a bill and
the committee will frame a l*w based
on both suggestions. The committee
will meet April 21, but practically de
cided to have the law prohibit inter
ference with funeral processions after
they are in motion.
SUPREME COURT ORDERS
NEW TRIAL. FOR CHINESE
Holds That Jury in Walnut Grove
Highbinder Trial Was Un
duly Influenced.
The Supreme Court yesterday re
versed the decision of the Superior
Court In the r| Â£S^se- o4j Chin Non, con
victed of the pvurHer of Jeong Him at
Walnut Grove. Four other Chinese
were implicated in the crime. The
case was bitterly fought and resolved
itself into a choice of testimony be
tween two toigs.
Jeong Him was attacked after leav
ing a restaurant by five Chinese and
shot to death. Witnesses testified that
Chin Xon was one of the murderers
and the defendant's tong brought forth
witnesses, white and Chinese, to prove
that Chin Xon was in another city at
the time of the murder. The result
was several arrests for perjury. The
Supreme Court reversed the lower
court and ordered a new trial for
Chin Non on the ground that the jury
was unduly influenced. Justice Hen-
Shaw dissented.

HALF-HOLIDAY
LAW IS LEGAL
City Attorney Holds That
Municipal Business Must
Stop Saturday Afternoons
AMENDMENT IS CLEAR
Charter Provides That Pub
lic Offices Shall Not Be
Open on Designated Days
City Attorney Long yesterday filed
an opinion with the Board of Super
visors to the effect that the amend-
ment to the Political Code designating
Saturday afternoon as a holiday,
during which all municipal business
shall be suspended, applies to San Fran
cisco and is now in full force and ef
fect. The opinion says:
The State law referred to is section 10 of
the I'olitical Code as amended during the ses
sion of the last Legislature. The original
flection designates the days and dates which
shall be legal holidays.
The amendment consists of an addition to
the section as It originally read, of the words
"Every Saturday from 12 o'clock noon until 12
o'clock midnight is a holiday as regards the
trantactlon of business in the public offices
of this State, and also in political divisions
thereof, where laws, ordinances or charters
provide that public offices may bÂ« closed on
holidays; provided, this shall not be construed
to prevent or Invalidate the issuance, filing,
service, "execution or recording of any legal
procpsa or written instrument whatever on
such Saturday afternoons."
The wording of the act which makes every
Saturday afternoon a holiday except in cases
where city charters or ordinances otherwise
declare applies to San Francisco, for the rea
son that our charter provides that upon legal
holidays public offices shall not be open ex
cept the office of Tax Collector and that only
during a period between certain dates men
tioned in the charter.
TTils does not prevent any office being kept
open upon occasions when the public welfare
demands that documents of great Importance
shall be filed or process Issued.
The opinion was read at the meeting
of the Judiciary Committee, which con
cluded that there was no necessity of
affirmative action on Hocks' resolution
notifying the heads of departments to
keep their offices closed on Saturday
afternoons, as the law itself is sufficient
notification. The offices will be kept
open this afternoon, but will close next
Saturday afternoon unless injunction
proceedings are begun by some tax
payer, a rumor to that effect having
gained currency.
The pure In heart never stop to think
about it

RENO, April 7.â Stunned by coming
in contact with a wire carrying 2500
volts of electricity, Bert Peck, a line
man to-day fell from the top of a
pole forty feet high. He escaped seri
ous injury by falling on the back of a

from the back of the animal, but to
their surprise he slid to the ground,
apparently uninjured. He asked those
around him what had happened and
when informed he laughed, ascended
the pole and resumed his work.
Peck was working on a platform with
several companions when he received
the shock. He accidentally placed his
hand against a section of the wire
from which the insulation had been
worn o-ff. The pole is on one of the
principal streets of the city and hun

PORTLAND, April 7.â The red haired
women of Portland are organizing a
glee club to be composed of 100 voices
to be trained and conducted by L. H.
Hurlburt-Edwards of the Oregon Con
servatory of Music. A goodly crowd
of auburn and golden headed damsels
has already been gathered, but the full
number is being obtained by the means
of a circular letter written to the
chosen of Titian locks.
The scheme is being taken up seri
ously, the purpose being ostensibly to
give concerts, but in the circular let
ter a deeper plan is revealed. The
writer, a red headed woman herself,
who is doing the promoting, appeals to
those blessed with burnished hair on
the ground that red hair as a mark of
beauty has not been fully appreciated
by the world, and that to gather to
gether the fair of face and red of hair,
combined with the power of voice will
make all those who hear and see fall
down and worship.

CONVEYS TITLE
TO CANAL ROUTE
Government Obtains Con
trol of the Dalles-Celilo
Waterway Near Portland
PORTLAND, April 7.â The State of
Oregon has delivered to Major W. C.
Langfltt a deed conveying title to the
Government of the entire right of way
for The Dalles-Celilo canal. This action
removes the last obstacle to the con
struction of the canal and insures the
early beginning of. work.
This great canar will lock around an
obstruction in the Columbia River
about 100 miles east of Portland. The
construction of the canal will admit of
transportation by water of almost the
entire wheat crop of Eastern Oregon,
Eastern Washington and Idaho, which
last year amounted to about 45,000.00*)
bushel 3. to the Pacific Ocean.
The length of the waterway that will
be opened to traffic will be over 500
miles. It will reach from the Pacific
Ocean to Lewiston. Idaho.

MURDERED MAN WAS BIAGGIO VILARDO, A SICILIAN,
POSITIVELY IDENTIFIED BY HIS BROTHER.
The man whose mutilated body was found near Vallejo and Powell streets was Biaggio Vilardo, a Sicilian laborer. He was an intimate friend of Joseph Brogardo, a recent victim of a Maria
Society. The police believe the same organization brought about Vilardo's cruel death. The body was identified by a half-brother, Crispino Vilardo.
BELIEVE BROCARDO'S SLAYERS
MURDERED BIAGGIO VILARDO
Dead Man Was a Friend oi the Victim
oi the "Black Hand."
MAFIA IS HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR BOTH CRIMES
Sicilian in the Morgue Paid for His Com
rade's Burial Fee.
The police are working on the theory that Biaggio Vilardo,
whose dismembered body was identified by his half-brother, Cris
pino Vilardo, last night at the Morgue, was done to death by the
same band of Italians who were responsible for the murder of
Joseph Brogardo. Brogardo was slain in a quarrel which start
ed in a barber shop at Francisco and Mason streets on Sunday
nig-ht, January 22, last.
Vilardo was an intimate friend and associate of the murdered
Brogardo. Vilardo also was in almost constant company with
Tartitta Benedetto, a first cousin of Brogardo. Vilardo, with
Brogardo's cousin, raised enough money, with what they could
give, to have Brogardo's remains buried.
Intimidation Used -Ajraiust Witnesses.
During the trial of Ancio Brissile. who was apprehended as
the man who fired the shots that killed Brogardo, witnesses for
the prosecution were harassed and repeatedly threatened with
death if they did not desist from giving testimony. The threats
are l>elieved to have come from the Mafia, or ''Black Hand," the
local Italian anarchistic organization. The Mafia even went so far
as to warn Detective Tom Gibsn that if he did not quit prosecut
ing Brissile he, too. would-be slain.
The case was assigned to Judge Dunne's court. Because of
intimidation by the Mafia and perjury on the part of the terror
stricken witnesses, the case has not yet readied its final disposi
tion. Pietro Raia and Salvatorc Alopia, witnesses at the Cor
oner's inquest in the Brogardo murder case, were arrested for
perjury. Raia appeared before Judge Dunne to plead yesterday,
when Attorney Spinetti interposed a demurrer to the information.
The case was continued till April 11 to be set for trial. Alopia ap
peared before Judge Cook. A demurrer to the information was
interposed and disallowed. The case was continued till April 15
to be set.
Conspiracy Against Brogardo's Life.
Although Brogardo was killed by one man. the police be
lieve the murder was the result of a preconcerted plan. This
opinion is based largely on developments of organized effort to
thwart the aims of justice in the prosecution of Brissile. Vil
ardo's great friendship for the murdered man and his associa
tion with Brogardo's cousin are, it is thought, the causes that
led to his being marked for deaih at the hands of members of
the notorious "Black Hand." Although he dared not work
openly Vilardo covertly assisted the police in the prosecution of
Brissile. His activities were noted by the Mafia and his death
was therefore decided upon, it is thought, as a matter to be done
when the first opportunity offered.
Brogardo was known as "Joe the Fisherman/ and was a
familiar figure in the Latin quarter. On Sunday night. January
22, he and a party of friends were gathered in the barber shop
of Pietro Raia, Francisco and Mason streets. The men had
been drinking all day long, and late that night a row started in
the shop.
Pursuers Fired as He Ran From Them.
The entire party emerged into the street and Brogardo,
fearing that some one meant to do him harm, drew a revolver
to protect himself. Xo sooner did he flourish the weapon than
a volley of shots was turned loose. Brogardo ran half a block,
where he fell wounded.
As his screaming pursuers chased wildly after him the
wounded man rose and continued his flight. His enemies, with
\engeance in their hearts, were close at his heels, firing rapidly
ey went. Brogardo ran half a block farther, when he fell
the second time, a bullet having pierced his heart.
The shooting created much excitement in the Latin quar
ter and in a few minutes policemen were on the scene. Pietro
Raia. owner of the barber shop, together with W. Brissile and
Antoni Papoli. were taken into custody on suspicion of knowing
something about the murder.
They denied all knowledge of the crime, but were held by
the j>olice. Soon after other witnesses were arrested and ques
tioned regarding the crime; but evidence was hard to secure, and
the police were baffled. It is believed that the crime was commit
ted by the Mafia, and that all members and others who had any
knowledge of it were warned not to talk under pain of death.
The theory now is that Vilardo was too bold, and therefore
the death penalty was meted out to him.

HORRIFIED BROTHER
IDENTIFIES REMAINS
OF MURDERED MAN
Detectives Graham and Harrison Discover
Victim's Kinsman and First Step in
Mystery Is Soived.
The mutilated body found Wednes
day night near the corner of Vallejo
and Powell streets has been identified
as that of Biaggio Vilardo, a Sicilian
laborer. His half-brother, Crispino
Vilardo, last night recognized the face
of the murdered man and declared to
Captain of Detectives Burnett hat the
victim of the crime was his brother.
The remains were first Identified by
Giaeamo Licurri, who had lived with
Biaggio Vilardo at 710 Montgomery
avenue till three weeks ago, when
Vilardo went to Oakland to work as a
laborer for a contracting firm. Fretito
Immediately notified Captain Burnett
and Detectives Harrison and Graham
were sent out to find the brother, who
is employed in the roundhouse at Six
teenth and Tov.nsend streets.
The identification by the brother
was dramatic. He looked at the face
for an instant and his own face grew
ashen. He shook as though stricken
with palsy.
"Dou you know him" some one
asked.
"Yes, yes," he replied quickly. "I
know him. He is my brother."
The man was immediately taken to
Captain Burnett's room and hastily
examined. He declared that he could
imagine no motive for the murder of
his brother.
"My brother lived at 710 Montgom
ery avenue till three weeks ago,"
Vilardo explained. 'Then he went to
Oakland to work for some contractors.
I do not remember the name of the
firm. r
"About two weeks aro I saw him on
this side of the bay and we talked for

only a few minutes. The conversation
would not throw any light on this
crime. I don't know of any motive for
any one to kill my brother."
"Did he know anything: about the
Brogardo case?" was asked.
"I do not know," replied the
brother.
"Do you know anything about it or
anybody connected with it?"
"I know some of the witnesses and I
was invited to go to the funeral, but I
did not go," Vilardo answered.
"Was your brother asked to go?"
"If he was he did not speak about
it to me. We did not see each other
very much. No, we did not have any
quarrel, but we were not much to
gether."
Crispino says that his brother was
about 31 years of age. He was un
married and a man of uncertain
habits.
After a hasty examination Licurri
and the dead man's brother were taken
to 710 Montgomery avenue, where the
dead man formerly roomed.
Russell Newman, a young man who
was formerly employed by Mm ray &
Ready, is positive that he saw Biaggls
Vilardo in their employment office sev
eral months ago.
Matilda Rubella, a woman of the
half-world, said that she knew the
man by sight, but could not remember
his name. â¢

tlnually heard about the Morgue yes
terday. After viewing the body some
one would go into the street and say
he knew the murdered man. This
would be a signal for a surging mob
to gather around the individual. Of

partment would take him in hand,
but after close questioning it would
develop that he was mistaken. Every

officials. They kept on the alert and
were willing to listen to fiimsy stories
in their efforts to establish the vic

Never in the history of this city
has such a crowd gathered at the
city's dead house. From early morn
ing the curious* kept coming and go
ing, and it is estimated that 15,000
persons looked at the ghastly specta
cle lying on the marble slab.
The police were kept busy pushing
the crowd along so it would not
blockade the alley. The doors were
opened in the morning. A steady
stream of humanity marched around
the slab and gazed into the face of
the dead â some to see if they knew
him, but the most of them attracted
solely by curiosity.
During the afternoon the doors of
the Morgue were closed for a time.

Hundreds of persons gathered in

ARE SURE
IT IS WORK
OF MAFIA
Investigation Is Difficult
Because the Name
Terrorizes.
Still Searching for Place
Where the Victim
Met Death,
The same gang that plotted thÂ«t kill
ing of Joseph Brogardo decreed the
savage murder of Biaggio Vilardo, the
man whose hacked body was found
near Vallejo and Powell streets W---1
nesday night. Evidence points con
clusively to the fact that a Matt.i
ciety does exist in San Francisco â a
gang more cruel and one that may
prove harder to root out than any
highbinder society.
Here is the evidence on which the
police base this belief: Biaggio V -
lardo was an intimate friend of Bro
gardo. He and the first cousin of Bro
gardo, whose name is Benedetto Tar-
titta, helped raise a subscription for
the dead man's funeral.
Vilardo's open sympathy for the man
under the ban of the Mafia enraged the
inhuman power behind the , "black
hand." It was decreed that he must
die In a manner that would be a warn
ing to all who dared even whisper a
word against the society.
And the example has had its effect.
Over 20.000 people viewed the body yes
terday. Among thes* were hundreds of
Latins who knew the dead man. But
they dared not even whisper his name.
It meant death even to know him.
Men who had seen him many times be
fore gazed at the gashes on the dead
man's head with terror stamped in
their faces.
"No. no. no." they asserted, "we do
not know him."
They felt in their hearts that a whis
per might bring on their heads the
same fate. They knew that to lift their
hand or voice against the Mafia would
mean that the assassins would lurk
wherever they went. Neighbors, towns
men and friendsâ lt was all the same.
The knife of a blood relation might be
lifted against them if they offended
the power behind the "Black Hand."

police burst into an empty room, al
most devoid of furniture, inhabited by
no one.
LANDLORD GIVES CLEW.
Aroused by the noise of the police,
Phillipe Ferritti. the landlord at 710
Montgomery avenue, appeared on the
scene and informed the detectives. that
the murdered man h.id not lived in his
house for three "weeks. It had been
a little over three weeks, according to
the story of the murdered man's
brother, since he had seen his brother.
They did not live together and he saw
him but two or three times a month.
A whispered conversation took place
between the detectives and the land
lord, in which Ferritti told Wren of
thp address v.lwre he believed Vilardo
had moved to three weeks prior to his
df>ath. Aft^r Crispino Vilardo had
been taken back to the Hall of Jus
tice and allowed to go, the police
started on a midnight hunt for the
house wh*Â»re Vilardo is believed to
have roomed at the time of his death.
BROTHER IDENTIFIES APPAREL.
The fact that the dead man's brother
stated that Biaggio Vilardo was liv
â r\z Utd working in Oakland is dis
credited. When returned to the Hall
cf Justice. Crispino identified the shawl
and blanket in which, the murdered
man trunk was wrapped after the
crime. The Ehawl, he said, was given
to his dead brother by his mother
when he left his horite in Sicily a year
and seven months ago. The blanket
a!so belonged to his brother and was
purchased by the dead man in China -
town. The fact that the murdered
man's ehawl and blanket were used by
his fiendish murderers to wrap his
warm body in after he had been foully
slain leads to the belief that the Qead
man was living somewhere in the
neighborhood of his recent abode at 710
Montgomery avenue.
MURDERED IN HIS ROOM.
The prevailing theory is that Vil
ardo was living within a radius of a
few blocks from the point where the
mutilated trunk was found at the foot
of a flight of stairs at the corner of
Powell and Vallejo streets. That the
murder must have been committed in
Vilardo's room is shown by the fact
that the murderers used the slain
man's blanket and Bhawl to wrap his
mutilated corpse in.
These foregoing facts also tend to
fehow that the man was struck from
behind with an ax or cleaver while at
his meal. He was working irregular
iy and had little money, for when he
worked he made but laborer's wages.
His brother says that he had a coal
oil stove and often prepared' his own
crude meals. It waÂ« after the prep
aration of his evening meal, as he sat
down to eat alone, apparently,, that
his assassins crawled from behind and
gave him the death blows.
FABRICS ABSORB BLOOD.
If the foregoing theories be correct,
the murderers chopped off the head
and extremities, divided ' the load.
wrapped the trunk in the dead man's
i-haÂ«; Qi.d blanket, to keep the telltale
blood from dripping. According to the
polioj the parts of the body were given
to two nÂ»< n to deposit in the bay. One
ma!! made his journey in safety and
deposited the sack containing the head,
arms and legs in the water at Fish
erman's Cove. The carrier of the other
portion of horribly mutilated human
burden was not so successful.
H<? probably met some one. or be
came nervous, and to make a detour
probably lie turned down Vallejo street
from Powell and sought to gain access
to the bay by way of Stockton street.
It was at this juncture that George
Olivia observed the murderer with his
peculiar load and caused him the fright
vhioh was responsible for the aban
doning of the trunk of th<? murdered
man on the sidewalk at Powell and
Vallejo streets.
Firm in the belief that the murdered
Vilardo lived in this city near the cor
ner of Vallejo an<s Powell streets, the
detectives are seeking again to locate
his room, where they expect to find
evidence of the crime.

POW ELL'S CASE
IS DISCUSSED
Havtian Minister Calls on
Secretary Taft in Reference
to Port Au Prince
Minister Leger to-day called on Sec
retary Taft to make further represen
tations touching the report of Ameri
can Minister Powell, recently made, to
the effect that serious trouble was ex
pected at Port au Prince. Minister
Leger complained that thiÃ report had
seriously embarrassed the Haytian of
ficers in the negotiation of a loan. He
did not make any official demand for
the removal of Minister Powell, how
ever.
Secretary Taft referred his caller to
Acting Secretary Adee, who endeavored
to show the Minister that Powell acted
only within the lines of his duty in re
porting to the State Department any"
conditions which he feared might lead
to trouble. Moreover, it appeared that
there really had been ground for ap
prehension, growing out of the pro
posed deportation of the Syrians. The
impression that Powell had been un
duly active in the interests of the Sy
rians and incidentally had contributed
to the agitation against the Haytian
Government was shown to be erro
neous.
A mail report from Powell was re
ceived at the State Department to-day,
dated Port au Prince, March '^. th>'
day before the last day of grace al
lowed th<- Syrians in the original de
cree of expulsion and before it was
known that an extension would be
granted. It appears that out of 1200
Syrians in Hayi 400 have left since
January 1. The remainder represent
naturalized citizens of every European
country except Germany, and the dip
lomatic representatives all have pro
tested successfully against the appli
cation of the decree to any Syrians thus
naturalized. The decree therefore will
apply only to native Syrians not hold
ing naturalization papers. There are
about forty of these people naturalized
in che United States who will be pro
tected in their rights.
Powell further reports that he has
secured a modification of the order
which prevented the Syrian merchants
from obtaining through the custom
houses American goods consigned to
them, so that such goods at least may
be returned to the shippers.*

OF BEEF TRUST
Former Secretary for Vice
President of Swift & Co.
Takes the Witness Stand
CHICAGO, April 7. â Members of
the Federal Grand Jury which is in
vestigating the beef trust were placed
in possession of "inside information"
to-day by Myron C. Baker, auditor for
the Boston Elevated Railroad "and for
two years private secretary to Edward
C. Swift, vice president of Swift & Co.
Baker was on the stand for nearly two
hours and is said to have furnished a
great deal of information concerning
the inner workings of the big meat
packing firms. In answer to questions
after leaving the jury-room Baker de
clared he had told the truth and that
from the action of the jurors it was
apparent to him that they had al
ready decided on what action would
be taken against the packers. It was
persistently rumored about the Fed
eral offices, where the jury is sitting,
that preparations are making to re
turn Indictments within a short time,
but whether the indictments will
charge violation of the anti-trust
laws, perjury or Interference with
witnesses could not be ascertained.
' Pid you tell anything that might
injure the cause of the packers?" Ba
ker was asked.
'Yes. I think I did. I told every
thing I knew, and It was the truth. I
testified for almost two hours."
"Did you present any documentary
evidence?" he was asked.
"No, I did not," was the reply, ac
companied by a significant motion
toward his forehead.
The jury adjourned to-night until
Monday.
The demurrer to the indictments
against T. J. Connors, Armour & Co.'s
general superintendent, on charges of
interfering with witnesses will be
caljed to-morrow morning and argued
before Judge Landis. The argument
will be on the demurrer for the
quashing of the indictment.

TAKES TEETH
FROM CORPSE
Special Dispatch to Tba CalL
LOS ANGELES, April 7.â Dr. Charles
Franklin Stewart, a prominent Chicago
dentist, has filed a contest in the courts
against Andrew A. Caswell, a palmist,
who lives in Long Beach, in which he
seeks to have set aside the will of his
mother, Mrs. Susan Stewart, who died
here recently, aged 75 years. In his
complaint Dr. Stewart makes several
sensational charges. The estate con
sists of $15,000 in cash and several
pieces of property of good value.
It is alleged that Caswell exercised
such an influence over the deceased
that he forced her to will to him all
her property and leave her son with
out a cent. This influence, it is alleged,
was due to Caswell's having through
his palmistry made her believe that he
was the only person in the world who
cared for her.
Dr. Stewart declares that Caswell
called at an undertaking establishment
where the body of Mrs. Stewart was
lying and told the undertaker that he
wanted everything as cheap as * pos
sible. Then he demanded a set of false
teeth which the dead woman had in her
mouth. He said he wanted to melt
down the gold. It is said that Caswell
took an instrument and pried open the
rigid jaws and removed the teeth.
Southern Merchant Arrested.
C. A. Bamberg, a hardware merchant
of San Luis Obispo, was arrested last
night on a warrant from the south. It
was learned later that the arrest had
been institgated by Bamberg's wife.

BROTHER WAS A COMRADE
OF THE DEAD BROGARDO.
Crispino Vilardo Is Found at .the
Southern Pacific Yards by
Detectives.
Relative of Victim Says Murdered
Man Was a Friend of the
Man Killed.
Through information given them by j
Giacamo Licurrl, Detectives Graham
and Harrison secured the identification
of the dead man at the Morgue last
night by the location of Crispino Vilar
do in the Southern Pacific Railroad
roundhouse on Sixteenth street. Gia
camo Licurri, a friend of the murdered
man and an associate of his brother,
called at the Morgue yesterday and
recognized the body as that of Biaggio
Vilardo. He did not notify the Morgue
officials, but told a friend. Detectives
Graham and Harrison received the in
formation, and found Crispino Vilardo
working as an engine wiper for the
Southern Pacific. He was taken to the
Morgue,' and after he had made the
identification was taken before Captain
Burnett, where he made the following
statement:
"I have been in this country twelve
years. My brother came to San Fran
cisco at my solicitation about a year
and seven months ago from Cefalu,
Palermo, Sicily, the home of our par
ents. On his arrival In this country he
went to Trinidad, Colo., where he
worked as a coal miner. He stayed
there three months and then returned
to this city. We lived together for
three months at 421 Greenwich street.
"My brother and I were always the
best" of friends, but after we had been
together for three months he said that
he would rather live alone. There was
no friction, no quarrel. I do not know
why he wanted to live alone. That
separation was one year ago.
"After leaving me my brother went
to work as a laborer in Oakland. 1 He
also worked on a new building on
Eighth street in this city. We saw
each other but seldom. I am a fire- [
man and sometimes am .out of town.
About three weeks ago I saw him for
the last time. He came down to see
me and told me that he was out of
work and had decided to go to Colo
rado. He was then BÂ« riving at 710
Montgomery avenue. "I'dlif not know
that he had moved.
"Biaggio was an Intimate friend of
Brog.'irdo, who was murdered a few
months ago. He was a comrade of
Brogardo's first cousin. Benedetto
Tartitta. A few days after Brogardo j
was murdered, my brother wrote me,
asking if I would come to the funeral.
Then he called to see me and wanted
me to assist in defraying the expenses
of Brogardo's burial. He and Tartitta
had given what they could and collect
ed some. I did not want to pay any
thing, so I told them no. I did not
attend the funeral.
"I do not know whether my brother
had any enemies. He never told me. I
knew little of his business. He was
not a member of the Mafia, or any se
cret or open organiztaion.
"I do not know why he waft killed
and have no idea who could have com
mitted the crime. Except for his few
friends, he liked to live in seclusion.
He was poor, and often cooked his own
meal 6 on a small oil stove in his room.
I do not know that he ever boarded
anywhere. He had no women acquaint
ances that I know of and seldom
sought their company. My mother
gave my brother the shawl his corpse
was Wrapped in."
Vilardo's father has a ranch in Sicily.
The dead man has two brothers, three
sisters and a mother and father living.
Vilardo showed little emotion, but
what he felt was little guessed by his
actions. Only once did he cry. That
was when he was on the way to his
dead brother's room. The weeping
was brief, and his face assumed the
stolid appearance that characterizes
the men of his race.
After a multitude of Queries failed
to elicit any motive for the murder,
Vilardo was asked if he believed that
the Maflt was responsible. Vilardo
gave his shoulders an ominous shrug
and was led away by the detectives.
CITY'S LEGACY
IS IN DANGER
SAN JOSE, April 7.â The $15,000 loft
the city of San Jose as a nucleus of a
fund to provide public baths by the
late Gottlob F. Thelig Is to be the sub
ject of a--contest by his heirs. Thelig,
who was a shoemaker, died about a
year ago, leaving his entire estate to
the city. He had six brothers and sis
ters residing in Germany, but did not
mention them In the will. To-day a
petition was presented In court against
a distribution of the estate to the city
by Max A. Thelig, Amelia Rath and
Emma Stanley, children of William
Thelig, a deceased brother of the tes
tator. They ask that one-sixth of â  the
estate, which would have been their
father's share, be given them.
Both Men Injured In Fight.
Bernard Conley and Harry Johnson,
who live at 404 Octavia street, engaged
in a quarrel last night which ended
with both men being injured. During
the argument a fight ensued and Con
ley cut Johnson on the head with a
knife. Johnson continued fighting
and when it ceased Conley had a
similar wound. They were both taken
to the Central Emergency Hospital for
treatment. Johnson says he threw
Conley down and he was injured by
falling against a post. The latter
maintains that Johnson used a gas
pipe during the fight. Conley was
placed under arrest.
FEEL SURE
IT IS WORK
OF MAFIA
Continued From Page 11, Column 7.
convulsively when he talked of his
brother to the detectives, at the same
time looked nervously about him,
scanning every face. With a detective
on each side he was still afraid that
at any moment a knife would be sent
through his ribs.
As yet the place where the vengeance
of the Mafia was carried out to the
brutal end has not been found, It
might be any house in the Latin quar
ter. Vilardo was the victim of a band
that carried out Its plans with the
thoroughness of a Corsican vendetta.
The murderers are believed to have
crept into Vilardo's room, wherever it
Is, and found him alone. They must
have engaged him in friendly conver
sation. " One felled him with a cleaver,
while another thrust a knife three
times into his throat.
Then they hacked him to pieces
quickly. They flung the head and
limbs into a sack. One of the murder
ers started toward North Beach. Then
the bleeding trunk was wrapped in a
shawr and packed In a blanket. Carry
ing this burden, another of the as
sassins went in another direction.
Both had their orders. The rest â
there w.ere probably more than two â
scattered. Their work was done and
done thoroughly. They felt that they
had little to fear. Who would give
evidence against the agents of the
"Black Hand?"
The police are working tooth and
nail now to find the room where the
dead man last lived. He had not been
living at 710 Montgomery avenue for
several weeks.
Detectives have been watching the
Fishermen's wharf for two days try
ing to discover whether any boat was
seen leaving the place on Wednesday
night. But there is little Information
to be got in that quarter of the city.
The dread of Mafia vengeance is
strong there.
The witnesses in the Brogardo case
will be closely cross-questioned to-day
by Captain Burnett. It is almost a cer
tainty that some of them can throw
light on the murder of Vilardo if they
dare to. They can at least give some
hint as to what drew down the venge
ance of the "Black Hand."
The barber shop near where Brogardo
was slain is closely . watched. The police
believe that men who gather there can
tell something about both crimes.

PRAYER CURE
SpÂ«claJ Dispatch to The Call.
DENVER, Colo., April 7.â Rev. Dr.
John H. Houghton, rector of St
Mark's, Denver's most fashionable
Episcopal church, is a convert to the
mental and religious healing idea and
has announced that he intends to es
tablish, with the aid of Henry Holden
Colpus of Philadelphia, a church guild
and clinic for the healing of people by
religious and mental methods. The
announcement created a sensation and
may disrupt the fashionable congrega
tion. Bishop Olmsted, who came here
from Pennsylvania, said to-day that
the rector's action is serious and will
be investigated thoroughly. He inti
mated that drastic action may be
taken.
Dr. Houghton says that the church
must face the issue raised by Christian
Science, the healing of disease by faith,
prayer and mental purification. He
says he has healed himself and others
in this way and will devote his life to
the work.
Dean Hart and other Episcopal dig
nitaries here always have opposed
Christian Science statements.
MAY APPEAL
TO PRESIDENT
RENO, April 7. â As a result of the
abduction of Deputy Sheriff Jennings
at Goldfield this week the people of
that place, or at least some of them,
have prepared an appeal first to Gover
nor Sparks, and, that failing, then to
President Roosevelt, for protection
against a recurrence of the outrage.
Jennings, it js said, was in charge of
a "ball pen" at Cripple Creek, Colo.,
some months ago. It is alleged, though
not proven, that the four men who ab
ducted him are members of the Min
ers' Union.
C. E. Wantland. land agent of the
Union Pacific at Salt Lake City, is a

LAST OF GANG
RUN TO EARTH
Ed Franks. One of Notorious
"Black Jack" Ketcham's
Bandits, Finally Captured
HUNT LASTS SEC YEARS
Desperado Caught in Wild
Section of Colorado. Where
He Established Himself
TRINIDAD, Colo., April 7.â After a
hunt covering a period of six years,
Ed Franks (alias Bob McManus). said
to* be the last surviving member of
"Black Jack" Ketcham's notorious
band of train robbers which terrorised
New Mexico and Southern Colorado for
many years, was safely placed in the
County Jail at Trinidad to-day. He
was arrested forty miles northeast of
Watervale, a small station on the Colo
rado and Southern Railroad, thirty
miles south of Trinidad, Wednesday
night by Deputy Sheriffs George Tits
worth and William Thatcher.
Franks lived alone in a wild, deso
late rocky canyon, difficult of approach,
where his safety seemed assured. The
officers located Franks' house Wednes
day morning, but were compelled to
make a detour and crawl through the
canyon for nearly three miles, as the
house was so situated that it com
manded a view of the open country
for miles. Franks was building a cor
ral when the officers surprised him. He
had a six-shooter and a rifle close at
hand, but made no fight.
After "Black Jack's" gang held up
the Colorado and Southern passenger
train in July, 1599, near Folsom, N.
M.. securing a large sum of money, the
robbers separated. Ed Farr, then
Sheriff of Huerfano County, with a
posse, surrounded Franks, Sam Ketch
am, brother of "Black Jack," and a
man named McGlnnis, on the Clmar
ron, near Folsom, and a fierce battle
ensued. Sheriff Farr was killed and
two other members of the posse were
wounded. Sam Ketcham was killed
and McGinnis was wounded. The lat
ter was captured a few days later and
is now serving a life sentence In the
penitentiary at Santa Fe. One mouth
after the Clmarron battle "Black Jack"
alone attempted to hold up the Colo
rado and Southern passenger train
again near the scene of "the former
robbery. He was wounded by Con
ductor Frank Harrington and was cap
tured. After conviction of robbery he
was hanged at Clayton, N. M., in Sep
tember, 1901.
Members of the posse have always
declared that Sheriff Farr was killed
by Franks, who was known to be a
dead shot. Jeff Farr succeeded his
brother as Sheriff and kept up a con
stant search for the fugitive.
NAKED MANIAC
RUNS AMUCK
LQS ANGELES, April 7.â Locked In
her room, crazed with fright, believing
herself the victim of an impending
tragedy and kept a prisoner by a beau
tiful young woman who, rendered tem
porarily insane, had set the house afire.
Miss Martha Mittler, an elderly lady of
3712 Westley avenue, on Wednesday
spent a night of terror.
After fleeing from her bed at dead of
night the frightened woman waited,
with doors barricaded, to resist the at
tacks of the crazed young woman â
waited in terror, not knowing what to
expect, until with the first streak of
dawn she saw beneath her window a
woman, destitute of clothing, crouched
shivering with the cold and almost
numb with misery.
Miss Mittler was working at the
home of Mrs. John Seick, aged 80 and
very deaf. The two women were alone
in the house, which is near Monro
via, There is no other house within
half a mile. After she had retired
Wednesday night Miss Mittler heard
some one trying to open the window
of her room, and got out of bed Just
in time to see the frightened face of
a woman pressed against the glass.
The woman was stark naked. Miss
Mittler called to her, but she did not
heed her and with her fists began
breaking the glass, at the same time
screaming at the top of her voice.
Miss Mittler ran to the room of her
aged employer, who despite her deaf
ness, had been awakened. They heard
window after window broken and
finally heard the soft footfalls of the
strange woman in the house. She came
to th^ir doosand tried to force it open,
but failed. Then she went from room
to room, overturning tables and chairs.
All night this continued, and at the
first streak of day Miss Mittler crept
out of the house. She found the naked
woman lying in the yard, almost uncon
scious from cold. Miss Mittler ran to
the nearest house for assistance, and
when a relief party approached Mrs.
Seick's residence they saw the kitchen
on fire. The naked woman had entered
the house and in trying to light a fire
in the stove had set fire to the house.
The flames were extinguished and the
woman secured.
She was immediately recognised as
a patient who had wandered away
from a sanitarium and had wandered
through the hills since the morning of
the day before. She was under treat
ment for nervous ailment and the ex
posure drove her insane. She is 2*
years old, beautiful and well educated
and the daughter of well-to-do parents

President Roosevelt, if he makes an

GREETING AT ALAMO.
SAN ANTONIO. Tex., April 7 â With
San Antonio richly decorated with pat
riotic emblems and the streets filled
with cheering throngs of people, Theo
dore Roosevelt to-day could not mis
take the hearty welcome accorded him.
Enormous crowds o/ people gree^d
htm along the route of the procession
from Fort Sam Houston to Alamo
Plaza, where an address of welcome
was delivered and a response was
made. The people felt that they had
as their guest not only the President
of the United States, but a man toward
whom the people of San Antonio feel
especially friendly on account of th->
fact that it was here that the Rough
Riders Regiment was organized.
The President was, delighted with the
reception. He was kept busy bowing
right and left acknowledging the out
bursts of enthusiasm. It is seven years
since President Roosevelt left San An
tonio with his Rough Ridem.
"No human being dreamed that after
that I would return as President of the
United States." he said in a short ad
dress at the railway station.
In Alamo Plaza, within the shadow
of the old Alamo, which the President
said .had seven years ago filled him
with a determination to do nothing to
reflect on the heroes who died there,
he was greeted in a manner which
touched him. His arrival was the sig
nal for a burst of cheering which lasted
until after he had taken his seat on the
stand, and which was renewed when
he rose to respond to the address of
welcome.
The President's speech was frequent
ly punctuated by applause. He was
pleased that San Antonio agreed with
him in his ideas on race suicide. He
noted with satisfaction the attention
Texans were paying to education. The
law of the worthy life, the effort in a
cause worthy of striving for, was his
theme. His reception throughout Texas
had touched him, he said.
TRIBUTE TO MOTHERHOOD.
The speech covered much the same
ground as former addresses. The Presi
dent said In conclusion:
"There is only one of my fellow-citi
zens to whom I will touch my hat
quicker than to the soldier, and that
is the mother, because I think she has
a little harder time of it. The mother
who has brought up. as they should be
brought up, a family of young chil
dren is entitled to such respect as no
other person in the community is en
titled.
"We all believe In the Monroe doc
trine. I have a little difficulty In get
ting some of my friends to accept my
Interpretation of It, but they will in
time, because that interpretation has
come to stay. We are building the
Panama canal. While that will be a
benefit to all the country, it will be of
most benefit to the Gulf States. We
have duties in connection with Urn
great position we have taken. We can
not shirk these duties. We ca:
them well or do them ill, but do them
we must. That is one reason why I
want to see a good navy, and we have
a good navy."
After leaving the plaaa the Presi
[ dent's progress was again hindered by
wildly cheering crowds that lined t'rvi
streets until he got far on his way to
the fair grounds. After the party en
tered the fair grounds the Rough Rid
ers pressed around the President and
the Secret Service men moved away.
This Informal reception lasted for half
an a hour, the President greetii:? and
chatting with each of the men who had
served with him.
A banquet was given the President
in the Mensror Hotel this eveniner by
the Business Men's Club. At its con
clusion the club gave him a handsome
pair of silver spurs with gold but
and ornaments. The President bat â

CARRIED AWAY
WHILE NAPPING
On board the Italian ship Amphitrlte,
which is discharging cargo at Howard
street wharf, is a man who boarded
the Bhip fourteen months ago at Tal
tal, Chile, to take a nap. When he
awoke the Amphitrite was at sea. He
has stayed with her ever since in the
hope that some day she may return
to the nitrate port.
The name of the man who was car
ried away in his sleep Is Luis Albaro.
He 1b a deaf mute and was one of the
public characters at the port of Taltal,
where he involuntarily joined the ship.
After leaving Taltal the Amphitrlte
sailed to Rotterdam. From there she
went to Antwerp, where she loaded the
cargo she is now discharging at How
ard-street wharf.
Luis is able to write his own name
and a few phrases of Spanish. Beyond
this his only communication with his
shipmates has been by signs, and of
necessity has been limited. Captain
Caflero is taking good care of his af
flicted guest, who still occupies in the
forecastle the bunk he selected for his
unfortunate nap. He looks well fed
and not specially unhappy, though his
shipmates say that at sea he frequent
ly gets very homesick. On his blue
sweater the legend "seaman" is print
ed in big white letters and Luis is said
to be quite a handy man when he un
derstands what Is wanted of him. By
his shipmates he is treated with a cer
tain amount of awe and Is gently
shielded from the hard knocks which
usually go with life in a windjam
mer's forecastle.
Luis was once a soldier in the Chil
ean army, but when the Amphitrite
was at Taltal he eked out a living as a
boatman. He was a privileged char
acter and allowed to go and come as
he wished. His position in Taltal was
a good detl similar to the one he now
occupies on the Italian ship, except
that there he was among people he
knew and with whom he could com
municate freely.
The Amphitrite's destination after
leaving here is uncertain, but is not
likely to be Chile.
CAPTAIN SCHUTT
IS DISCHARGED
Heacock Hands Down a
Decision on the Eeal
Meaning of the Law
INTENT IS NECESSARY
Negligence Alone, Says the
Court, Not Sufficient to
Furnish Proof of Guilt
United States Commissioner Heacock
yesterday dismissed the charge against
Captain W. Schutt, master of the Ger
man bark Professor Koch, and handed
down an oral decision that will have
an Important bearing upon all sim
ilar cases. Captain Schutt had been
charged with having illegally landed a
member of his crew who was afflicted
with trachoma and whose landing had
been forbidden by United States Im
migrant Commissioner North upon rec
ommendation of the Federal quarantine
authorities.
In rendering his decision discharging*
the defendant, Commissioner Heacock
said:
The testimony in this case doea not show
that the master of the vessel, in any manner,
to any extent whatever, consented to the land
ing or the going ashore of the seaman named
In the bill, and although I hold that he was
negligent In that he did not take sufficient
precaution* to prevent the seaman getting
ashore, he was not sufficiently negligent that
it could be Imputed therefrom that he. In any
manner, consented to such landing. The testi
mony here is that the master acted In the
best of faith to prevent this man from going
ashore. In my opinion section 8 of the Im
migration act, under which this charge waa
prosecuted, requires consent and Intent on the
i part of the master of. the vessel.
The representative of the German
Consul made a few remarks upon the
arbitrary power exercised by the ma
rine medical officer of the United
States. He said:
The marine medical officer under the statute
Is made the only and the highest tribunal to
determine whether any of the passengers or
seamen are afflicted with any contagious dis
ease. From his decision there is no appeal,
and your Honor assumes that it is conclu
sive. Now, the marine medical officer may
be the most competent official in the State,
yet it is possible that he may make a mistake.
It is extraordinary that the liberty and com
fort of people coming to this country on a ship
are dependent upon the reports of these of
ficers, while in all other controversies the de
fendant la given a chance to defend himself
by introducing other expert testimony, and he
is given the right to appeal.
The imperial German Consul had these men
examined by two of the most eminent special
ists In the country on eye diseases â Dr. Adolf
Rosenthal and Dr. Dake â and both have cer
tified above their signatures that there is not
a vestige of trachoma and that the rednese
of the eye was caused by the irritation from
boisterous weather.
The Consul then asked Judge Hea
cock to use his Influence to have the
law amended so as to obviate the ob
jections made.
It is believed that the charges against
the captains of the Magdalene and the
Luxor will be dismissed on the same
grounds.
Will Trace Adulterated Wines.
Health Officer Ragan yesterday di
rected the food inspectors to locate
the manufacturers of the red wines
which were condemned after analy
ses showed that the samples con
tained adulterants. In many cases
the dealers said that the wine had
been purchased in bulk and in large
quantities from the big wine con
cerns, who they contended should
be held responsible for the adultera
tion. Further investigations will be
prosecuted before definite action is
taken by the Health Board.

STANFORD MEN ARE SURE OF VICTORY
ATHLETES WHO SPORT THE CARDINAL COLORS SHOW
HIGH CLASS PERFORMANCES IN PRIVATE.
Miller Is Expected to
Prove Sensation on
;he Track.
â RD TWIVERSITT. April 7.
â¢^-collegiate track meet
the University of California is
a week off Trainer "Dad" Moulton
â  ears the same expansive smile
hat has adorned his features since the
â  â  first discovered his promising
rreshman sprinters. The vet
< sder of ihe fortunes of the car
< .na! Bod not expect Stanford will win
â¢ming meet by any great margin.
â¢ is confident that when the last
:naÂ» has cleared the bar in the pole
â¢ v&ult, the final event of the day, a
. ictory. close but sure, will rest with
bis proteges. His opinion is shared by
;he men themselves, for they fee} that
-his year they have the best team that
has ever represented Stanford on the
v:atk. In a nutshell the cardinal is
strong in the long distances, weak in
die sprints, strong: in the hurdles, weak
.1 the field events and strong in the
. .'Tups.
: art of the strength of Stanford this
: tar lies in the remarkably speedy
". -inch of freshmen. Of these Milier.
- long, eiin: youth with a tireless
I stride, who hails from Bakersfield, is
the premier runner. He was a mller
v hen he came to college, but under
"Dad" Moul ton's tutelage he learned
t :? cover the half-mile also. T:r-n .came i
the meet with Pomona College. Miller I
begged the trainer to let him run the |
â¢er-rnile with the others and as j
an ' experiment the permission waa
given, although he was not expected to
be able to stand the hard strain of |
three race* Imagine the surprise of â ;
every one when Miller captured the 1
Inile event in the fast time of 4:40. the
half s 2:02 and on top of this pulled
rut an easy first In the quarter, cover
ing the distance in :52. Moulton's eyes
v.er* opened wide and he now counts
en the freshman to win the same three
r?ces in the intercollegiate meet.
*, The next freshman who caused the
bleacher* " to shout in enthusiasm over
h:s work was Horton, also of football \
f:we. He can run the high hurdles in
ilzte^n seconds, fast time: he has
t-.aten the best cardinal men in the
l;w hurdles and he puts the shot out
for Â« distance of over forty feet.
*man - Lanagan, brother of the
football coach, should win the pole
vault. He has entirely recovered from
i he "jury to his leg and is clearing
The bar cleverly at something over
eleven feet. Severy in the half-mile,
carttmann in the sprints and Davis
in. the quarter are the other freshmen |
v. ho are expected to make points for
\hr â ardina!.

EXCITING INDOOR WORK
Games at the Sportsman's
Show Present Pastime
in an Agreeable Form
There have been so many other
events to attract the attention of the
tennis cracks that but little considera
tion has been given the coming annual
intercollegiate meet. This important
event is scheduled for next Saturday,
and, as usual, will be played on the
California Club courts In the morning.
The Stanford team has been selected.
George Hodge will be No. 1 man in sin-
gles, R. M. Swain will be No. 2 and
Hodge and John Cassell will be the rep
resentatives in doubles.
Players are so numerous at the Uni
versity of California that the manager
has been kept busy trying to complete
the tryouts. ThiÃ will in all probability
be done to-day. Only one position has
as yet been filled, that of No. 1 man In
singles. Claude Wayne of Southern
California won the singles champion
ship of the college and will be pitted
against George Hodge.
Harry Rolfe, Herbert Schmidt and
Neil Baker will meet in a round robin
this morning, and the winner will be
California's other representative In sin
gles. The doubles team will be made
up of either Rolfe and Schmidt or
Wayne and Varlel.
As usual, the prospects of California
look much better than those of Stan
ford. Although the boys across the
bay are expected to win they will have
a harder time doing so than they have
had for several years. Many expect
California to take all three points, but
the matches should be close and inter
esting.
The Indoor tennis at the Pavilion has
proved an attractive feature of the
Forest, Fish and Game show. The play
ers are practicing dally and are rapidly
becoming accustomed to the lights and
to the footing. The opening games on
Wednesday night proved much more of
a success than was expected. The two
remaining semi-final matches will be
played this afternoon. In singles Harry
Rolfe and Carl Gardner will meet, while
in doubles J. R. Lewis and E. P. Fin
negan will be opposed to Charles Dun
lap and Charles Foley.
The finals of both events are sched
uled for next Wednesday night, and
will be worth going to see.
On Thursday night an exhibition
doubles will be played and some high
class tennis will be witnessed. The
Hardy brothers, one of the strongest
teams ever produced on the coast, will
meet Percy Murdock and Grant Bmith.

GOLFERS PLAN
HANDSOME HOME
Design Has Been Accepted
for Country Club House
Near Ingleside Course
READY AT END OF JULY
Tournament of California
Women Golfers' Associa
tion Draws Many Entries
Plans for the new clubhouse to be
erected at Ingleside for the San Fran
cisco Golf and Country Club have been
placed on file at the Hall of Records.
The design is by R. W. Hart, the ar
chitect, the style being domestic Gothic,
with obtuse arches and perpendicular
lines. A short flight of steps will lead
to a spacious inclosed piazza com
manding a fine view of Lake Merced,
the valley and most of the golf course.
From the veranda three large doors
lead to the main living-room, which
will have a high mantelpiece of clinker
brick. The wainscoting and the beams
of the low ceiling will be of redwood
and thÂ« windows will be filled with "art
glass." When the large doors are open
the living-room and the piazza will
make one large apartment. On a mez
zanine floor looking on to the main
room will be the ladies' parlor, with
walls of tinted plaster and a fireplace
of clinker brick and black marble. Off
the parlor will be the ladles' locker
room, with seventy lockers and sev
eral shower baths. The men's locker
room on the ground floor will contain
280 lockers. To the left of the entrance
is a dining-room and on the upper floor
are eight members' and four servants'
bedrooms. The exterior of the building
will be of clinker brick and untinted
shingles, with brown decoration and
a green roof.
The work of selling the old quarters
and of securing a site and plans for the
new clubhouse haÃ been done by Cap
tain J. S. Oyster, R. D. Glrvin, R. J.
Woods, Dr. J. R. Clark and S. C. Buck
bee, the directors of the San Francisco
Golf and Conntry Club, a corporation.
The clubhouse adjacent to the United
Btates military reservation haa been
sold to a firm of real estate agents and
will probably be removed, as it inter
feres with the plan for creating a park
on First avenue and Sacramento street.
The new clubhouse is expected to be
ready for use at the end of July. It
will be erected on a site purchased for
the purpose from a private owner,
while the ground for the new golf
course has been leased from the Spring
Valley Water Company. The club
house sit* consists of rather more than
two acres of land to the west of the
Ingleside race track and at some little
distance from the Ocean road. The
building, without reckoning the furni
ture and appointments, will cost about
$15,000.
The first tournament of the Califor
nia Women's Golfers' Association, held
on the Presidio links for the northern
division and on the Lob Angeles Coun
try Club course for the southern divi
sion, was remarkably successful. The
success is almost wholly due to the un
tiring work and Â«eal of Mrs. R. Oil
man Brown, who wrote 500 personal
letters to the Individual women mem
bers of the various clubs comprised in
the association. Entries were received
from all the clubs in the north, eleven
being from the Ban Francisco Golf and
Country Club, five from the Menlo Golf
and Country Club, five from the Linda
Vista Golf Club of San Jose, three from
the Claremont Country Club and two
from the San Rafael Golf Club. Mrs.
Brown has received many cordial con
gratulations upon the interest manifest
ed in the opening tournament and
many words of praise for her arduous
labors in the cause of women's golf in

Coast Amateurs' Association
of Oarsmen Proposes to
Hold First Event in 3lay
The chances for an Interesting rowing
season for the oarsmen of San Fran
cisco Bay seem good. The newly or
ganized Pacific Coast Association of
Amateur Oarsmen Is making arrange
ments for a regatta to be held at Val
lejo in conjunction with the Vallejo
Yacht and Boat Club on Decoration
day.
It is likely crews from this city and
the neighboring towns will take part
in some of the rowing contests to be
held at the Lewis and Clark Exposition
at Portland, Or. On the Fourth of July
a regatta to decide the barge, skiff and
shell championships of 1905 will be held
| on Lake Merritt, under the manage
ment either of the Pacific Association
of the Amateur Athletic Union or of
the Pacific Association of Amateur
Oarsmen. On the 9th of September a
series of rowing races will be held at
Sacramento in connection with
the decennial celebration of the
Native Sons of the Golden
West in the capital city. In
addition to all these events the Ala
meda, Dolphin, Ariel and South End
clubs will hold members' regattas, so
the oarsmen will have plenty to en
gage their attention.
Last Sunday was a busy day for the
Ariel oarsmen, the club boats being in
constant use. Four barge crewa were
out for practice. The first was made
up of George Goodwin, J. A. O'Connell,
Lyman Jennings and A. Pollock. An
other crew comprised William McKee,
E. Smith, Henry Kalmbach and Charles
Davis. A third crew consisted of N. A.
Denvir, H. Valdespirio. S. Klarnett and
Johnson Hardy. E. Stack, T. Qulnn,
R. Chisholm and A. Sharp were In the
fourth crew. The outrigged skiffs were
used for practice, handled by A. Kee
gan, Herman Opeldt, E. Hannon. L.

Charles Wilson and E. J. Lynch,
The regular monthly meeting of the
Ariel Rowing Club was held last Mon
day. A new series of by-laws, in which
several important changes are embod
ied, was adopted. Henry Williams and
James O'Connell were appointed a com
mittee to visit Stockton to-morrow for
the purpose of conferring with the rep
resentatives of the rowing clubs with
regard to the regatta which it Is pro
posed to hold at Stockton at some early
date. The members requested the
board of directors to acquire more boats,
both for racing and pleasure. It was
decided that the club shall make as
many entries as possible in the regatta
to be held at Vallejo on May 30.
The Pacific Coast Association of Am
ateur Oarsmen held a meeting at the
Ariel Club house last Sunday. It is
proposed to hold a theater party, the
proceeds of which will be used to de
fray the expense of bringing Ten Eyck.

TARS TO MAKE ANOTHER
EFFORT TO RAISE BRIDGE
San Francisco Yachtsmen Secure I/e-
gal Power to Tow Fleet Out of
Lagoon Into Cove.
The bridge over the entrance to the
lagoon at Tiburon did not rise last Sun
day. The boat owners of the Corinth
ian Yacht Club had set that date as the
day for towing the yachts that were
laid up In the lagoon last November
out into the waters of Belvedere Cove.
The yachtsmen proposed, but a rep
resentative of the Bridge Building
Company disposed. This Inconvenient
person wants the sum of $6000, or there
abouts, paid to him before he will per
mit the bridge to be raised high In the
air. As only half a dozen yachts, three
of which will make their headquarters
at Sausalito during the coming season,
are in the lagoon, the Corinthian
yachtsmen did not accede to the de
mand for $5000.
The sloops Amigo and Sans Souci
have been chartered by members of the
San Francisco Yacht Club and the sloop
Juanita is owned by J. R. Savory, an
old member of the same club. The Nep
tune and Cupid belong to the Corinth
lan fleet and there are some arks in
the lagoon.
W. G. Morrow, commodore of the San
Francisco Yacht Club, has bestirred
himself in the matter and has procured
the authorisation of T. P. Boyd. the
District Attorney of Mai in County, to
raise the bridge to-morrow. Any one
who Interferes with its opening will be
liable to arrest. The yachtsmen, how
ever, must provide blocks and tackle,
as the superintended of the Bridge
Building Company will lend no aid.

Eound for the I nion Cup
The match in the semi-final r
of the contest for the California Asso

played between the Oakland Hornets
and the Vampires on March 26, and
which resulted in a drawn game, will
be replayed to-morrow on the Presidio
Atheletic Grounds. J. Frew will be
the referee and the ball will be kicked
off at 2:30 p. m.
The winners will play in the final
round against the Independents on
Sunday the 16th inst. The game will
be an interesting one, the defensive
lines of the contestants being so good
that the score of the winners 1s likely
to be small. The Hornets hu.ve the
stronger attack, but the strength of
the Vampires lies in their back and
half-back lines.
The match played last Sunday at
Freeman's Park between the Inde
pendents and the Albion Rovers was
a remarkable one. In the flrst period
the Albion Rovers scored three goals
to one made by the Independents.
Under these circumstances the Albion
Rovers should have won the game, for
all they had to do was to maintain
their advantage. They might have
withdrawn two of their forwards and
played with four half-backs and three
backs, thus rendering scoring by the
enemy difficult. Their forwards might
just as well have been withdrawn, for
they did not score a single goal In the
second period, though the Independent
defense was not all that it should have
been.
A team with a lead of two goals
should never be beaten in a cup
match, where stonewalling tactics can
be adopted readily. Ballmains two
successful shots for goal in the first
few minutes of the second period
equalized the score and the Albion*
lost heart. They could neither scorÂ«
themselves nor prevent their adversa
ries from making- goals.
An excellent game was played last
Sunday at Sacramento between the
Eagles of Alameda and the Sacra
mento eleven. The play waa lively all
through and at the close of the first
period each team had scored threÂ«
goals. The Eagles made the first.
third and fifth goate. while th* horn*
team scored the second, fourth and
sixth. Early in the second h.ilf the
Sacramento team scored again, mak
ing it four goals to three in its favor.
Five minutes later a fifth goal was
obtained by the home eleven. From
that time to the final whistle the
Sacramento team played a defensive
game and neither side scored, the
match ending five goals to three in
favor of the Sacramento eleven. The
goals for the winners were made by
Macartney (3), Button (I), and
Wright (1). Pomeroy. Wilson, Me-
Shane and Cameron also did good
work for their team.

TRAPSETTER DEFEATS BAB.
Bab and Ocyrohe were the chosen two
for the mile and twenty yard selling
affair, each going to the post at odds
of 18 to 5. The latter started off to
make the running, but his reign proved
a short one. Trapsetter, a 15 to 1 shot,
piloted by Graham and fairly bursting
with speed, assumed charge on the far
turn and was never extended, winning
from Bab by three lengths. The show
fell to Matt Hogan. Harry Beck ran a
fair race.
It took a can of china nut oil and a
deal of Imagination to figure Al Waddle
winner of the mile selling fixture, still
Sam Jones' horse had many friends.
There was 8 to 1 in profusion, and
Lloyd Fountain landed the Oregon
horse first, a handy winner over Esher
in, the 11 to 10 favorite. Travera rode
a perfect race on the latter. Augie, a
12 to 1 shot, downed Big Beach for the
show.
TRACK NOTF.S.
A change of riders works wonderful
Improvement in the form of some
horses. There are two or three riders
at Oakland in whom a change of cli
mate might work beneficial results.
The field book at Ascot Park. Los An
geles, is reported to have won more
than $80,000 on the season recently
closed. In the days of the old Bay Dis
trict track ripe cherries were plentiful
in this fog-stricken part of the State.
Charley Bell said that Paladia ran
out with him. It's some consolation to
know what caused the bonfire.
Birkenruth on Clausus got an early
start, but didn't reach home until after
dark.
On Tuesday, with Jakle Jones In the
saddle, Dangerous Girl was heavily
played to beat an ordinary field, and
did not finish among the first five. Yes
terday, with Travers up and at 100 to 1,
the filly finished right at the heels of
Busy Bee and Achelita, There must be
a leak in the roof somewhere that needs
looking after.
The odds about Parting Jennie were
played down from 100 to 15. The book
makers have no objection to purchasers
of tickets keeping the same as souve
nirs.

Fortunately for Louis Ezell, he ia in
the East, and doesn't own Trapaetter
now. anyway.
Pete Romigh lost Titus. Dan Meeks
bid up the gelding from $600 to $900, at
which figure Pete walked away.
Improvements are costly, even in
racing. After Al Waddle had beaten
the favorite, Esherin, Charley McCaf
ferty boosted the winner's selling price
from $500 to $800. Sam Jones retained
his horse.
Now that Solomon Bonner is ruled
off, it is reported that he will learn to
be a blacksmith. That ought to be easy
for him.
Fustian was one of the fast horses
down at Ascot Park. Either he has
lost his speed or else the clocks up this
way run slower than they do In the
southland.
Some time back McÃrlde's riding was
ordered restricted to the Miller stable
alone for thirty days because of the
Jockey's rough tactics. As his appren
ticeship expires on the 13th inst. and
he has promised to reform, the suspen
sion was lifted by the judges yester
day.
On February 15 a filly named Irene O,
ownel by G. Wilson, a colored man,
appeared as an entry in a five and a
half furlong scramble for maidens.
Irerre O had worked fast and prepara
tions were made for a "killing." Un
fortunately for G. Wilson, he could not
identify his filly to the satisfaction of
the judges and she was ordered
scratched. Shortly after this occurrence
Wilson and his stable departed, sup
posedly for Los Angeles. Beyond cavil
of doubt Irene O was a ringer and the
authorities at Ascot Park were notified
to watch for her. But she never reached
there. This same G. Wilson started a
mare named Florista, with pedigree
given as by Emperor of Norfolk-Flor
pntine, at Hawthorne track last sum
mer, and later on at Kansas City. Flor
ista finished third to Dragoon and Com
rade at Hawthorne track on Saturday.
August 27. A 100 to 1 shot in the bet
ting, she wu heavily played for the
show. This Florista was a ringer, for
Charley Tupper of l*os Angeles recent
ly stated that he sold the real Florista,
a daughter of Emperor of Norfolk, to
John A. Cole of San Bernardino, and
that the mare was not outside of this
State last summer. The supposition
now is that the Chicago Florista was
none other than Abba L, formerly
owned by B. A. Chilson of McNamara
fame. The latter famous ringer waÂ»
poisoned. The present whereabouts of
G. Wilson is not known.
McGovern's Nerve Gives Way.
ST. PAUL. April 7. â Terry McGov
ern, the former, featherweight cham
pion pugilist of the world, who is
playing a theatrical engagement here,
is said to be on the verge of a nervous
breakdown as a result of overwork,
excitement and constant traveling in

to a health resort to recuperate.

THE PORTLANDS DEFEAT
UNCLE'S PLAYERS.
Northerners Outhit the
Men From This
City.
Jones Incurs Wrath
of Umpire Davis
in Fifth.
Even if the Portlanders did boot the
ball around the lot eight times at Rec
reation Park yesterday afternoon they
clouted It hard enough to squeeze three
runs through. The Seals could not do
any walloping, so the beet they got
was a gift of two through the kind
ness of the hostile fielders. It was a
nose finish. Scoreâ Portland 3, San
Francisco 2.
Bertien Jones pitched shutout ball up
to the time he was put out of the game
in the fifth spasm. He had everything
but support. This the fielders abso
lutely refused to give him, but when
Easick mounted the mole he was treat
ed like a prince and from that time
on San Francisco did not figure.
San Francisco shone only in the third
spasm, when errors put Wheeler and
Mohler on the sacks. Wheeler stole
and then the Portland infield took an
ariel ascension. The ball was thrown
to all parts of the lot by Runkle and
McLean and in the meantime both
Mohler and Wheeler tore through to
the piate with the only runs for
Uncle.
Householder and Atz bit off singles
in the fourth and Runkle secured a
pass, making it a full house. Clark
flew to left and Householder beat the
throw to the plate. Jones responded
with a drive to center, letting in Atz.
Van Buren singled in the seventh, stole
on the first ball pitched and arrived
when Judge McCreedie pushed one up
against the right field fence for two
sacks.
Jones incurred the displeasure of Mr.
Davis in the fifth, when he made stren
uous objections to a decision at third
base. He knelt down and offered up a
prayer and for this little act out of the
game he had to go. Essick relieved
him and from that time on the Seals
went down one, two, three, right along
the line, so deceptive were the curves
of Essick.
Atz had a bad day at short and
bouted three in succession. The Seals
kept hitting them â¢ hard at Runkle
throughout the game and he let two
get away from him. San Francisco
played perfect ball in the field, but
even this cannot win ball games with
out the aid of base hits. The score:
San Francisco â Portland â

HIGH SCHOOL BASEBALL
GAME ENDS IX WRANGLE
Mission and Uek Teams Have an Un-
satisfactory Contest on Presidio
Athletic Ground.
The Lick and Mission High School
baseball teams had an unsatisfactory
game yesterday on the Presidio ath
letic grounds. The score stood. whÂ»n
all the players had left the field, five
runs for each. In the final part of the
ninth inning the Lick team was at bat.
With one Lick man on third base and
but one out and the team's heaviest
slugger at the stick, the Mission boys
objected to playing any longer on ac
count of darkness. Carpy, the Mission
pitcher, lost control of the ball and
the chances were that Lick would win.
A long and a warm discussion took
place, which put a stop to further play.
While the umpire was considering hia
decision the Mission team withdrew.
Umpire Kennedy refused to give a
decision. His colleague. West, de
clared the game forfeited by Mission.
Kennedy said if West's decision held
good he would give the game to Lick,
otherwise he would pass it up to the
Academic Athletic League to decide.
Kennedy wrote a statement of his posi
tion and delivered it. West, the um
pire officiating on the bases at the
time, said that, although it was Ken
nedy's place to decide, he declared per
sonally that Lick was the winner.

RAILWAY BUYS A SLICE
OF EMERYVILLE TRACK
Deal Starts a Wild Rumor That the
Race Course Across the Bay
Has Been Sold.
Rumors which have been in circu
lation fcr several days to the effect
that negotiations between the New
California Jockey Club and the Santa
Fe Railway Company had ended in
the sale to the latter of the Emery
ville race track property were set at
rest yesterday by Thomas H. "Wil
liams, president of the racing asso
ciation.
It was stated last evening by Pres
ident Williams that the story had
probably arisen out of the fact that
the jockey club had given the owners
of the race track property permission
to sell to the Southern Pacific Com
pany a small portion of the outer part
of the track grounds for a ticket of
fice site.
Recently the officials of the South
ern Pacific Company made an offer to
the owners of the ground for a small
section of the latter, upon which they
desired to erect a ticket office, and by
consent of the Jockey club, which holds
a long lease on the Emeryville site,
it was finally agreed that forty-four
hundredths of an acre of land at one
end of the track should be transferred
to the railroad company. In order to
clear the newly acquired office site the
fence of the race track will have to
be moved back a short distance. The
railroad company has agreed to have
this work done at its own expense.

Commuters Shut Out
the Siwashes at
Idora Park.
Schmidt's Curves Fool
the Batsmen of
Seattle Team.
OAKLAND, Aprtl Tâ Clay Hawback
er's Commuters revenged themselves
upon the Slwashes to-day for the shut
out of yesterday and not a paleface
from Seattle was allowed to cross the
gutta percha, while three of thÂ« victors
romped over the rubber.
Tow-headed Nick William* **& Smil
ing Bchmldt operated their bread-win
ning propellers and both were penuri
ous with htts, Williams permitting but
two and Schmidt three safe swats,
Nick walked seven Oaklanders to the
first corner and fanned one man.
Schmidt struck out seven Slwashes
and passed three of the tribe to sack
No. 1.
Streib and Kelly tallied for thÂ« locals
in the second period. Streib was hand
ed a pass to first, purloined the h&lf
way sack and came through on Kelly's
safe drive to left. Kelly spurted to sec
ond on the thow-in to nab Streib and
imitated Streib's thievery by stealing
third. Devereaux corked an Infield out
over Williams' flaxen ringlets and Kel
ly raced home. Midget McMurray
made the third run for the Oaks In the
eighth. Williams could not get three
strikes over to the kldlet and started
the little backstop on the paths.
Schmidt sacrificed the small one to sec
ond and Cotton King sent him In on a
two-sack smash to the left lawn.
Kane, the Slwashes' sentinel at the
third station, and one of the "finds" of
the season, was always where he could
do the most good. He hammered out a
three-bagger In the sixth spasm, but
his mates were unable to help him any
nearer home. Miller made a spectacu
lar grab of a long, low drive from
Kruger's bat in the first lnningr" that
had steam enough behind It to roll
Dusty on the green.
Captain Rip Van Haltren and Catch
er Jimmy Byrnes of the Commuters ar<Â»
still out of action because of illness.
Oswald was scheduled to go behind the
bat to-day, but as he had not paid a
fine Imposed upon him yesterday Um
pire Gus Klopf would not permit him.
to don the mitt and chest protector.

TURF FACTIONS
SEEKING PEACE
CHICAGO, April 7.â Peace among the
warring factions in the Western turf
seems almost a certainty. A confer
ence will be held in Cincinnati next
week, the direct result of a secret meet
ing held here Wednesday night be
tween members of the Western Jockey
Club and the American Turf Associa
tion. At this meeting it was agreed
"that any reasonable terms of settle
ment" would receive the support of
the Chicago forces when the conclu
sions of the arbitrators are brought
before the two bodies.
It has been admitted by all that the
Chicago tracks were reprtisented at the
gathering and that each representa
i tive pledged himself to place no ob
stacle In the way of a peaceful adjust
ment of the controversy.
"I am going to- Cincinnati some time
next week with Martin Nathanson and
George Perkins to consult with a com
mittee from the American Turf Asso
ciation." said Lawrence A. Young,
president of the Western Jockey Club,
to-day. "'I know of nothing that will
be done there and I do not wish ta
express myself in any way as to the at
titude of whether the Jockey Club con
ference will be merely tentative in or
der to ascertain how each partj;
stands.
"I do not know how matters stand
with the American Turf Association.
It would seem as if the new turf body
would meet us on equal grounds. As
for Washington Park I have nothing aa
yet definite to say. Our action will om
delayed until after the conference. WÂ«
will wait until then before we do anyÂ«
thing."

NEW YORK, April 7. The wave of gpecu
lative enthUEiasm whloii dereloped r: in 'yeÂ«
terday'e stock market as a result of the sud
den awakening in United State* Steel pre
ferred was 'carried over into the early market
of to-day fmd swept price* qolte comprehen
sively to a higher level, with an appearance
of great -gnlxoatlon and buoyancj-. But the
rcarket underwent . a considerable change of
lona in t!te-' T Â«ou' I rse~of- th'Â» day and the trad-
Ing became . much, quieter and thÂ« tone re
actionary by : raet. There was some pres
sure to take profits in recent special favorites
:.-..:.-. the - outset and the pressure gained in
for<> during the day. The change In the mar
ket's tone was not based on any widespread
genera! condition, but waa explained by con
siderations of a narrower ppe, such as have
fore* .. with board-room operators. Traders
bought stocks freely while they found that
prices advanced easily and there was ready
opportunity to secure profits for a quick turn.
Buf some of the newer ventures brought out
Â«uch heavy offerings on the advance that the
cor-SSerice of the traders deserted them. This
*ss notably true of Kock Island, which had
c movement for a long time
â¢vac 1 : the professional
- for that reason alone. They rea
- ng pre.ct!'-al;>- dor
to a level of re
with thp advances already effected
â 8 1 of this stock
brought out such enormous blocks In lliiuida
tion that the load proved too heavy to carry.
It w*s evident also at the opening high level
lor-JL'itited States Steel preferred the attrac
tion of jjronts was fo tempting as to bring in
FelHr.g orders in excess of the demand. ThÂ»
â  i tiie highest of
: centered In
I ? late sharp ad
ir.r.gr out selling:
ord<jm. "Hiis obvious â¢ ndency of the trading
took away the confidence of the speculators
for .the. rise and the aggressive demand eub
sided gradually. Different stocks were taken
up in detail and lifted sharply In the effort
t<> contest the reaction. There wu a %'cry
striking movement in American Smelting,
which was based upon the assumption that
the pfan for further combination of the smelt
ins- end lead companies was nearly accom
plished. The increase in the dividend of
Vnited States Rubber preferre* helped the
stocks and the industrials generally. In the
oper.ing rush to buy much was made of the
remarks made in a s^ech yesterday by Presi
dent I&oo&i*-c2t inculcating J.Â« desirability ot
*alr treatment to the railroads n any legis
lation for their regulation. A former intima
tion oh the i>art of - the Harriman Interests
of en intention to make no further contest
of the Northern Securities case was of some
efTert. The good prospect for the winter
wheat crop waiÂ« assigned as grouiids for spe
cial strength of come of the Southwestern
railroad?. Estimates of the week's currency
movement indicate a tmi:: gain in cash by
the benke. but call money rosÂ« again to above
4 pÂ«-r cert and caused some revival of mis
rivingE ever the future supply. The active
speculation of Issssrsaai has resulted in some
bV.-clirfe in their favor as collateral of loans.
The persistent strength of sterling exchange
alto, in vinw of the low rates for foreign
discounts and the relative firmness of mosey
here, is something of a mystery and induces
a eurmise that â¢ -ancee are bÂ«iag made
for >enÂ« special tmi pose, -ih!y <-,n eutMicrtp
tions to the Japanese loan placed laÂ»t week.
Quite a brisk recovery followed the late re
action in the market and the close was ir
regular, but only a lew stocks recovered to
the tea .level.

HAS NARROW ESCAPES FROM JAPANESE SHELLS
Port Arthur Surviv

Manchuria
SHELL SLITS EAR
Admiral Whiting Is
[Now in Splendid
Health.
RETURNS ON LINER
Captain John B. Aulin. whose home
<s in East Oakland, and who, when the
Russo-Jap^nes-j warcloud burst, was
manager at l'< rt Arthur for the big
thippinc firm of Clarkson & Co., ar
rived yesterdcy orr the liner Man
churia wjih -ii- M-ar and some thrill
ing recollections of the bombardment
oi the Knstian stronghold. Three times
he made the close ijuaintance of the
Mifcsuio'tf ;immui;ition, but, though he
neither duclu-d, dodged nor sought
refuse urmyrground, one small scar
wheit a shell -nr his ear is all the
physical haim ihat beleil him.
Tii interests <Â»f Mch Captain Aulin
wÂ£s in charge were Jarge and impor
tant. Ke was the custodian of much
valuable property, and in caring: for it
he was compelled to drive from one
iixnit to the other of the beleaguered
city four times a day. Two trips would
have 6'imced had the captain cared to
miss his home tiffin, but the appeal of
the midday meal was stronger than his
fear of death, t>o home he went to
luncheon under a sky filled with burst
ing comets of steel.
The emptmtn'm blood was spilled on
the Btst day of the siege. He got in
â  ark of a fragment of a shell fired
by a Japanese war vessel He felt a
bbai i< pain and found blood on his
hand w hen he -touched the place that
hurt. He found later that a fragment
of shell had slii his ear as neatly as
a knife could have done it.
: :he middle of the siege a six
inch shell dived in through the roof
>>f his house and lodged in the floor
<= bedroom, where he wad^being
etaaved. Fortunately for Aulin the
thell did not expiode, and a lew hours
later Russian soldiers tenderly dug it
t trie rtuor and sent it back to the
Japanese lines.
SHELL KNOCKS OFF HAT.
â lore the fortress fell
Aulir: was. driving home to tiffin, when
a shei! from the Japanese lines ex
ploded near him and one piece knocked
hit hai oft' his head.
And for all oC this Captain Aulin
vouchee on his word of honor as an
honest manner.
i aptain Anita Fays that food was not
particularly scarce in Port Arthur
[or those with money to buy it. Bread
..bunt \z\-2 ctnts a loaf, and very
fine horse meat couid be bought for 50
cents a pound. There were no vege
tables. Â»however. and the health au
thorities were without means of treat
ing: the many cases of scurvy which re
fculted from the diet. He thinks that
Port Arthur could have been held for
at least torn* months longer.
Vjache6'.ave Ruciiieff. a steerage
passenger on the Manchuria, is a
ire of the captain. Ruchieff was
a civil engineer in the service of the
Trans-Siberian Railroad. He was in
Port Arthur during the siege, and lost
hiF job when Stoessel loet the fort. He
has come to this country to learn the
English language. His immediate des
tination is New York. Ruchieff. was
very much afraid of his Japanese fel
low passengers, and kept himself hid
den away during the voyage.
Rear Admiral W. H. Whiting, who
â was knocked down and seriously
hurt by a Ptreetcar in Honolulu, re
turned on the liner. The admiral was
taken to his station on Goat Island by
a navy tug. He has entirely recovered
from his accident and will be able to
resume his duties as commandant of
the training station. He was on his
way to serve on a court-martial at
Manila when the accident occurred
which necessitated his return.

Another Testimonial.
DEAR DOCTOR:
For two years after our wed-
ding my mother-in-law stuck to
us. I then purchased one of
your elevated oven Kas ranges
and sent to her home. Since
that time she has been so de-
lighted with it that she remains
at home and cooks for all the
neighbors.
We now have to visit her, as
she does not have time to worry
us. Your great cure is the best
on ear:h.

Manchuria, Rear Admiral F. Grenet
of the Italian navy. Admiral Grenet
for a year has been in command of the
Asiatic division of the Italian navy.
His flagship was the armored cruiser
Marco Polo. With Flag Lieutenant T.
Scapin he is returning to Italy for as
signment to other duty. Grenet has
been an admiral since 1896. During his
naval career he has smelt powder only
once and that in 1866 when he served
as a sub-lieutenant during Italy's war
â with Austria.
Among the passengers on the Man
churia was General W. M. Graham,
V. S. A., retired. With Mrs. Graham
and their daughter the gallant old
soldier has been visiting in Manila and
touring Japan, where, he declares,
there are no signs of war.
Men from some more of the captured
blockade runners were passengers in
the Manchuria's steerage. There were
nine sailors from the German steamer
Romulus; four from the German
Bteamer Serverus and two from the
Danish steamer Wagga. All three ves
sels were captured while tiding to take
cargoes of coal into Vladivostok.
The Romulus, after her capture and
while on her way to Japan in charge
of a prize crew, went ashore south of
Hakodate and became a total loss. The
men from the Romulus say the Japan
ese supplied them with slim rations
while in custody, but gave them one
good, square meal the day they were
released.

for the Arrest of Mrs. A.

lice Judge Mogan yesterday for the
arrest of Mrs. A. Tillman, a wealthy
widow, on a charge of maintaining a
nuisance in the shape of a cesspool at
821 Green street, which is owned by
Mrs. Tillman. Diphtheria has broken
out In the neighborhood, which is at
tributed to the cesspool, and all at
tempts to get Mrs. Tillman to abate
the nuisance have failed.
Mrs. Coe applied for a warrant on
Wednesday, but the bond and war
rant clerk thought it advisable to send
a letter to Mrs. Tillman, asking her to
call and explain. The letter was sent,
but as Mrs. Tillman paid no attention
to Jt the warrant was issued yesterday.
Mrs. Coe was armed with a letter
from Dr. P. de Vecchi, which oaid
that the cesspool was injurious to the
health of the residents in the neigh
borhood and would breed diphtheria
germs.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, AFRTL S. 1905.
SOME DISTINGUISHED PASSEN
GERS THAT ARRIVED ON THE
LINER MANCHURIA.
APPOINTMENTS
ARE EXPECTED
In political circles the appointment
by Governor Pardee of Judges dt
the District Court of Appeals is hourly
expected. It is the common expecta
tion that the incumbent Supreme Court
Commissioners will be named by the
Governor. At the Union League Club
last night the prediction was made by
a leading Republican that Judge A. J.
Buckles of Solano County would be ap
pointed from the northern district. The
number of aspirants in the north is
large, and there are bound to be many
disappointments when the names of
the prize winners are announced.
The Central District, which embraces
San Francisco, Alameda, Marin, Con
tra Costa, San Mateo, Santa Clara,
Santa Cruz, Monterey, San Benito and
Fresno counties, contains a legion of
applicants. There Is gossip to the ef
fect that Judge Henry A- Melvin
stands high in the favor of the Gov
ernor. Other leading candidates in Al
ameda County are Superior Judges S.
P. Hall, W. R Greene and John Ells
worth.
N. Blackstock of Ventura, who was
recently appointed Bank Commissioner
to fill the vacancy caused by the resig
nation of Guy Barham, has entered
upon the duties of his office. He is ex
amining country banks In Southern
California.
There is a strong impression in
Marin County that Editor Pryor will
be appointed to the Board of Prison
Directors.
MARINE FERE2HAN HELD

ets.
The two officers started on a hurit
for the footpads and in a saloon at
Third and Bryant streets they found
Walter Thomas, a peddler, and John
Purcell, a stone mounter. They ques
tioned Thomas and Purcell, and not
receiving satisfactory answers they
were placed under arrest. They were
later identified by Oksa as the two
men who had robbed him, and Albert
Ramsay, 646 Third street, identified
Purcell as a man he saw striking
Oksa. Thomas and Purcell were
booked at the City Prison on a charge
of robbery. When searched Thomas
had $1 40 in his pockets and Purcell
$13 40.

Nevills Wants More Time.
Through his attorney, W. A. Nevills
made a hard fight before Judge Mur
asky yesterday to get a further post
ponement of, the. trial of his action
against William Fleming and others
involving something like $300,000.
The controversy is over mining stock.
The inability of ex-Senator J. P. Jones
to be here for the trial, which was set
for the 11th inst.. caused Nevills to ask
for a continuance, as Senator Jones is
one of his most important witnesses.
As Fleming is opposed to the continu
ance, having come from the East to be
present at the trial, Judge Murasky
was not certain yesterday what it was
best to do, so he took the matter un
der advisement.
TELLS OF WORK
AT LEGISLATURE
Executive Committee of the
River Improvement Asso
ciation Files a Report
MEMBERS ARE NEEDED
Selection of the Drainage
Commission Authorized
Under Law Is Important
The executive committee of the
River Improvement and Drainage As
sociation of California has submitted
to the association, in the form of a
bulletin, a report relative to work and
results in the recent session of the Cal
ifornia Legislature in legislation to
forward the aims of the association.
The report is. in part, as follows:
An act was passed at the last Congress
authorizing- the Secretary of War to appoint
a commission of three ene'.neers to examine
and recort uDon the Sacramento, San Joaquln
and Feather rivers and their tributaries.
No appropriation can be secured trom the
Federal Government for river Improvements
unles the work has be*n previously reported
on an<l approved by the chief of the United
States engineer corps, acting under the Sec
retary of War.
The action of Congress, therefore. Is a mat
ter for congratulation aÂ» .evidence that we
have both interested the Federal Government
In the undertaking and secured the first atÂ»p
necessary toward an appropriation from thÂ«
United States.
It is anticicated that this Federal commis
sion will resort on the feasibility of the plan
recently presented by the commission appoint
ed by the State and that the necessary panc
tlon and indorsement will be secured from the
"War Department.
The interest of the State has been evidenced
In the leclslation enacted by the passage of
the drainage bill, insuring the co-operation
of the State with the landowners.
The drainage bill, which has become a law,
la practically the bill presented to you In bul
letin 4, and which was presented as Assembly
bill 794. There were some stood suggestions
made relative to some of the details of this
bill during the discussion at various confer
ences after. lts Introduction, which suggestions
were accepted by the executive committee and
Incorporated In Assembly bill 1082. which Is
printed in full In this bulletin.
It is not doubted that more familiarity with
this bill as passed will lshcw some further
pointÃ requiring modification. The necessary
amendments can be made at later sessions of
the Legislature. However, It Is believed that
the State at large and those interested In the
development may be heartily congratulated on
the fact that a definite and comprehensive
basis is now outlined for the reclamation of
the swamp lands of the Sacramento Valley.
The importance of what has been accomplished
Is made Dromlnent by the axDiesslon used by
Governor Pardee In his message to the Legis
lature, when he says:
"Not the least ampng the important meas
ures of the session has been the legislation
for tho organization of a great drainage 'dis
trict in the Sacramento VaJley, which is ex
pected to lead to the control of the winter
floods and the reclamation of over a million
acres of fertile land."
The Important matter immediately before the
land owners 19 the selection of the men who are
to form tho Drainage Commission. So respon
sible are the duties that will devolve upon
these Commissioners that It is of vital mo
ment that the right men are secured for the
service.
They must be capable, honest, broad minded
men. and men who will give their time to thÂ«
â work and are earnest in tneir desire to see the
swamp land? reclaimed. It is strongly urged
upon the owners of swamp lands to considor
welt the candidates for election to the very
important task before this commission.
The River Improvement and Drainage Asso
ciation of California has a. great amount of
â¢work yet before it. Its work, In fact, has but
commenced. The people of California, must be
fully educated to the necessity of appropria
tions to be made by the Legislature. The as
sociation must use all of Its power and influ
ence in dealing with the question of obtaining
assistance from the Federal Government, and
it must at the same time act as a neutral
body, with a view to carrying forward the plan
of reclamation and river improvement.
It has also to see that the legislation sought
at tbe last session of the Legislature in the
way of a constitutional amendent to facilitate
the securing of right of way, etc, Is favorably
acted upon at the next session.
It is Important that with all of this work
before it the association must be a large and
representative body, and every one of the thou
sands who are interested In this great move
ment should be identified with it as members
of the association.
Again we call upon you to make an effort
to secure new members. Work of this charac
ter cannot be accomplished without funds.
More funds will be necessary. The executive
committee serves without compensation, but
money is required all the time for necessary
clerical expenses, for the printing of bulletins,
for postage, etc.
If . each present member would enroll five
new members and send in the dues to the secre
tary they would not only neip matters by put
ting the exchequer In a satisfactory condi
tion, but they would be assisting to enlarge
and strengthen the association, which has al
ready done much and still has much to do.
W. E. HOLBROOK PURGES
HIMSELF OF CONTEMPT
Oil Dealer Convinces Judge Kerrigan
That He Is Unable to Pay
Wife Alimony.
W. E. Holbrook, a member of the
American Oil and Refining Company,
purged himself of contempt yesterday
by proving to Judge Kerrigan that he
is unable to pay his wife, Essie Hol
brook, whom he is suing for divorce,
alimony as ordered. Mrs. Holbrook's
counsel sought to show that Holbrook
had transferred 35,000 shares of oil
stock worth $5 a share for the sole
purpose of evading the court's order,
but Holbrook pointed to his petition
in Insolvency, filed prior to the filing
of the divorce suit, and testified that
all the stock he ever owned had been
turned over to John B. Fulton In pay
ment of a debt of $14,000. He also
testified that his expenses now do not
exceed $33 a month and that his pov
erty is largely due to his troubles
with his wife, which have prevented
him from properly attending to his
business. Upon this showing Judge
Kerrigan dismissed the order to show
cause, but renewed the order that
Mrs. Holbrook be paid alimony and
allowed $150 counsel fees as soon as
Holbrook gathers in the funds with
which to meet the obligations.
Bertha Hesse was granted a divorce
yesterday from Edward W. Hesse on
the ground that Hesse had been con
victed of a felony. Hesse was former
ly a well to do citizen of this city, but
fell into evil ways and forged a note,
which resulted in his conviction on a
felony charge. Samuel R. Leon was
granted a divorce from Sofie W. Leon
on the ground of willful desertion.
Suits for divorce were filed yester- !
day by Sadie against Frank Joachim !
for desertion, Elizabeth against W. A.
Courtwright for cruelty, Marie against
William Heyden for cruelty, Wilmer j
B. against Flora V. Thomas for deser- |
tion, Clara against L. A. Coldwell for
cruelty, P. H. against Anne Bagley for
cruelty and Josie against John Hai
german for failure to provide.
Sarah Ferry Pandolfl has sued An
gelo Pandolfi to annul their marriage,
which occurred November 11, 1899.
She alleges that she has just discov
ered that at the time she married
Pandolfi he had another wife living. |
Since her marriage to Pandolfi three !
children have been born to her. She j
asks that the custody of two of them
be awarded to her and one to Pan- '
dolfi. I
This is not the only world that is
callous to the man who goes around
looking for a chance to put his feel
inea under the other fellow's feet.
FRUITFUL WORK
BY CHRISTIANS
Occidental Board's Annual
3leeting Comes to Close
After Annual Meeting
OFFICERS ARE ELECTED
Willing Helpers Take Some
Burdens of Missionary
Efforts in Foreign Lands
The thirty-second annual meeting of
the Woman's Occidental Board of For
eign Missions brought to a close yes
terday afternoon three days of sessions
which will be recorded as the most suc
cessful in the board's history in this
city.
Mrs. J. G. Chown presided in the
morning and Mrs. C. S. Wright in the
afternoon, and besides the Introduction
of missionaries and a remarkably able
address on "The Russo-Japanese War"
by the Rev. Ng Poon Chew, there was
an impressive memorial service for
Mrs. John Hemphill.
In her annual report Mrs. Wright,
the president, said that they were still
hearing the old, old cry. "There is so
much to do at home." Mrs. Wright said
it was told them to "go and preach to
the uttermost parts of the earth,"
hence as Christians they went on in
faith, teaching the heathen at home
and sending teachers to the heathen
abroad. The board in reaching its thir
ty-second annual meeting came filled
with gratitude and thanksgiving, for in
many ways this had been the very best
year the organization had ever known,
the grand total showing a gain in both
membership and gifts.
In a few days they would have one
more Presbyterial society to add to
their board, as Arizona had come in
with a strong following.
The board Is sending out six new
missionaries this year, the support of
five of that number having been as
sumed by the organization.
Over $2600 had been contributed to
ward the In His Name Hospital at
Syen Chyun, Korea, where Dr. Alfred
Sharrocks is physician and surgeon in
charge. This extra amount had been
donated owing to the demands on the
hospital through the Russo-Japanese
war.

Trans-Pacific Shipments of
Freight Have Eeached a
Record - Breaking 3lark
MORE VESSELS XEEDED
Harriman 3la.v Soon Find It
Necessary to Build a Few
â¢ More Huge Ocean Liners
Never before in the history of Pa
cine Ocean traffic have the F
Mail and the Occidental and Or
Steamship companies suffered MN
for the lack of freighting capacity thaa
at the present time. Although the Har
riman syndicate has only recently
placed two nÂ»Â»- and exceptionally large
vessels on the trans-Pacific run, freight
is arriving here from the East in such
enormous quantities that the steam
ship companies can hardly see their
way clear to handle it.
On Wednesday the tramp steamer
Imirapura. leased by the Pacific Mail
Company, departed for the Orient load
ed to ,her decks with about 10.000 torn*
of freight, and still there is awaiting>
shipment in thf same direction 320 car
loads of freight, which has recently
been delivered here by the Southern
Pacific Company and, according: to the
records of the latter transportation
company, there are "50 carloads des
tined for Japanese and â¢""nina port*
now on the way to this city.
The Manchuria, which arrived yes
terday, will unload her eastbound car
go as fast as possible and immediate
ly proceed to ship between 12.000 and
14,000 tons of freight, but even then
the railroad yards and docks of thÂ«
steamship companies will be taxed to
their full capacity to accommodate the
freight that is dally pouring in from
Eastern points. From the present out
look it is believed that the high pres
sure of trans-Pacific business will con
tinue for severajfyears at least; that is,
until Ion? afteÂ»*\Japan and Russia have
entered into peaceful relation*, and
with such a prospect it will not sur
prise many who are acquainted with
the situation if the announcement is
soon made that the Harriman syndicate
has placed orders for the construct io-n
of more steamers of thÂ« Manchuria and
Mongolia tyx>e.
BKISSIUE IS ARRAIGNED
ON A CHARGE OF MURDER
Two Witnesses Accused of Perjury at
Inquest Appear in Court to
Have Case* Set.
Ancio Brissile was arraigned in
Judge Cooks court yesterday on a
charge of murder. At the request of
his attorney the case was continued
till April 13 for the defendant to>
plead. Brisslle is charged with shoot
ing and killing of Joseph Brogardo, a
fisherman, on Sunday night, January
22. Brogardo and his friend, Dom
inic Rosario, went to a barber shop
at Francisco and Mason streets. Bris
sile and others were there and Dom
inic and Brissile quarreled about
dancing. They went outside to right,
but Dominic was induced to return to
the shop. It is thought that Brogar
do and Brissile quarreled and Brissile
commenced to shoot at Broarardo, who
ran, followed by Brissile till he fell
mortally wounded in front of 10 Van
dewater street.
Pietro Raia and Salvatore Alopia,
witnesses at the Coroner's inquest on
Brogardo's body, were at the time ar
rested for perjury. Raia appeared be
fore Judge Dunne yesterday to plead,
when Attorney Spinetti interposed a
demurrer to the information. It was
overruled. The case was continued
till April 14 to be set for trial. Alopia
appeared before Judge Cook when a
demurrer to the information was in
terposed and disallowed and the case
continued till April 15 to be set.
Arrested for Cruelty.
John Louarn, driver for John Mine
han. proprietor of the Soring Valley
dairy, was arrested yesterday after
noon by Officer M. McCurdie. assist
ant secretary of the Society for thÂ«
Prevention of Cruelty to Animals,
charged with cruelty to a horse.
Louarn was driving a four-horse out
fit from Sansome street to the Six-
Mile House on the Mission road and in
the team was a horse with shoulders
worn raw by the heavy collar. ThÂ«
matter from the sores had soaked into
the collar and caked, so that the ani
mal was in constant pain. Louarn
shifted the blame on his employer,
who in turn said he knew nothing: of
the horse's condition.
