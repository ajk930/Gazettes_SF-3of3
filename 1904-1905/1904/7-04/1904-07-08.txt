Conservatives Carry the Election.
LONDON. July 7. â A bye election
yesterday at Chertsey to fill the va
cancy caused by the resignation of
John J. Fyler (Conservative), re
sulted in the election of Lord Bingham
(Conservative). The campaign was
fought almost wholly on the question
of admitting Chinese labor into the
Transvaal. This the Liberals declared
tantamount to slavery.
As the noise began to subside Chair
man Williams, seized a huge mega
phone and endeavored to announce that
the recess had ended and .it was time
for the convention to come to order.
There was still so much confusion
as the huge -gathering was trying to
compose itself that the chairman's
voice, even through the megaphone,
was hardly audible. It was finally as
certained that the committee on cre
dentials was ready to report.
Just at this Instant Mr. Bryan arose
in his place and began making his way
to the platform. As soon as this was
observed up went the convention again
on its feet and the cheers arose with
fresh vigor. When Mr. Tryan mounted
the platform young Deford. one of the
secretaries, got' on a table next to the
presiding officer and. throwing both
arms into the air. shouted and waved
The Hearst men and Tammany men
were prepared to meet it by a Parker
counter outburst of their own.
rieda blue silk banner inscribed "Geor
gia Parker delegation" every time they
marched into the hall, at once waved
it high and started toward the plat
form. An enthusiastic delegate from
South Carolina caught the sign of his
State from its staff, tore up the steps
and after brandishing the red and white
disk wildly shook it at the Bryan and
Hearst men and then placed it fiat
against the blue banner, as though he
w;as nailine the flag of his country to
a' masthead. The Parker men came up
swiftly now, and before the South
Carolina, man had lowered his hand the
men from Arkansas, Alabama and
Pennsylvania were turning over chairs
and pushing their way through the
aisles toward him. After Pennsylvania
came Mississippi. New Jersey. Tennes
see. Indiana. Louisiana, Texas, Connec
ticut and Virginia.
The demonstration had resolved It
self into, a. Parker outbreak more than
a testimonial to Bryan, and It so re
mained to. the finish, which was eight
een minutes after Bryan, entered the
hall. . ;
The Parker men claim that they had
information before entering the hall
that the Bryan demonstration had been
prearranged.
â¢ ST. LOUIS. July 7.â With the prom
ise- of' a contest of gladiators over', the
adoption of the report of the committee
on credentials, the convention hall filled
early -for the afternoon session. Long
before the delegates began to arrive
the gafleries filled. .The band gave a
concert, which was appreciated and ap
plauded, and every number was en
cored. . ' ' .
William J. Bryan was given an ova
tion when he entered the hall just prior
to the. opening of the afternoon session
of the convention. He was half-way i
down the aisle when he was lirst recog
nized.',There, came a terrific yell from
a group of delegates in the rear of the
hall, and instantly it was caught up by
t he ; crowd, and the cheers rolled up in
a roar.- Mr. .Bryan passed down the
aisle, picking: his way through the del
egates, who were massed in the aisles.
He paid no. attention at first to the
demonstration, but quietly sought his
seat. The galleries joined in the cheer
ing,'hundreds of the crowd standing up
In Â¦ their chairs and waving hats and
handkerchiefs frantically. The band
struck up and the friends of Bryan, be
lieving this to be an effort to smother
their shouts, yelled: louder than before.
A man climbed to the chairman's table
and began to wave his ; arms uj> and
down, shouting unintelligibly. In a mo
ment Williams caught sight of him;
and ; grabbing the enthusiast by the
trousers' hauled him down. A wild

Bryan Presents Minority Substitute,
but It Is Swept: Aside by a Vote
of 647 to 299.
REPORT OF CREDENTIALS
COMMI TTEE IS ADOPTED
The followers of Hearst were march
ing through the streets to-night ani
taking possession of the hotel lobbies,
with bands and drum corps and ama
teur orators. , It is their last demon
stration and they are denouncing Judtre
Parker In unmeasured terms. Hearst'3
name will be presented to the conven
tion, as will that of Wall of Wisconsin.
It is not probable that the names of
Gorman, Gray or Olney will be pre
sented. Their supporters will go to
Parker.
Bryan's fight on the platform to-mor
row is no longer feared. In fact, it will
help serve the adoption of a more con
servative platform than was believed
possible a few days ago. The conserva
tives will now voVe for anything Bryaa
opposes.
Among those whose names are con
nected with the second-place gossip are
Governor Alexander M. Dockery of
Missouri and David R. Francis of Mis
souri, David R. Kern of Indiana, James
R. Williams of -Illinois, Senator John
W. Daniel of Virginia, Governor
Charles B. Aycock of North Carolina
and former Senator George Turner of
Washington. Â£ i. ; .'*
Quite an effort has been made to con
centrate on Francis, and a similar ef
fort for Kern. The Carollnas are for
Aycock, and the Virginia delegation to
night secured the consent of Senator
Daniel for the presentation of tys name.
Conferences on this subject were held
late in the night and probably will con
tinue during the convention hours to
morrow.
There is a report to-night that the
Illinois delegation, under instructior.3
for Hearst, may feel that It Is no longer
obligated to vote for him. because th>*
Hearst men all joined in the effort t<>
unseat It. At all" events It would seem
that Illinois is in a position to raak. 1
Parker's nomination certain, even if
some of the votes that were in the
negative column should be cast for
other candidates for President.
The anti-Parker men are buildin?
some hopes upon the action of the sub
committee on platform in adopting a
gold standard and are asserting that
some of the Southern States instructed
or pledged for Parker will_ desert him
If the convention adopts the gold
standard plank. Among the States
named in this connection are South
Carolina, Kentucky. Mississippi ami
Texas. This is the only ? apparent hop-;
that the anti-Parker men have to
night.
With the end of the convention in
sight, there is still a chaotic condition
in regard to the Vice Presidency ami
the outlook now Is that a large num
ber of candidates will be voted for
and perhaps several ballots taken be
fore any one Is chosen.
VICE PRESIDENCY GOSSIP.
VENGEANCE UPON" HEARST.
ST. LOUIS, July ?.â Before to-mor
row night the Democratic convention
will have adopted a platform, nom
inated candidates for President and
Vice President and adjourned sine die.
If the programme of the leaders can
be carried out. The Parker men are
now talking of his nomination on the
first ballot, and they are positive that
not more than two ballots at the out
side will be necessary.
The vote to-day on the Illinois case
was the i st. and it was favorable to
Parker. There were 946 votes cast <xÂ£
the 1000 votes in the convention, the
54 of Illinois being withheld. The neg
ative vote on Bryan's minority report
was 647, which is twenty votes short
of the necessary two-thirds to nomi
nate. It represented, with some ex
ception, the Parker strength, although
it had also some of the opposition, in
cluding the 32 votes of Massachusetts.
At the same time there were cast on
'liiraÂ£*the-2iJ -rotes or Kentucky and the
18 votes of Louisiana, making 'a total
of 62 votes from States that have de
clared for Parker. Deducting the votes
of Massachusetts and adding the 62
votes of "the Parker States gives a to
tal of 677 votes which may be classed
as Parker, with some exceptions from
the smaller States which did not vote
Parker or anti-Parker on the contested
case. It would seem likely that these
few votes would be balanced by those
who voted In the affirmative to-day
and are likely to vote for Parker to
morrow. But in addition to the 677
votes accounted for there are 54 in
Illinois that are ready to come tt>
Parker when he needs them.

SENATOR SOUTH INTERRUPTS.
Senator South interrupted/, at' this
point with an expressed desire^ to
speak to the. question and accordingly
took the platform. He. declared, that
it had never been a part of Democrat
ic doctrine to consider the insular pos
sessions as part : of the United States
and he was opposed to such 1 action.
He deprecated the idea of holding the
question in abeyance: until the: report
of the credentials committee was-re
ceived, and asked the Â¦ convention, to
vote down that part of the. commit
tee's report. '. . -..:.;â¢â¢
There were loud. calls. of "question,"
but the chairman again recognized L.
Irving Handy of Delaware, who spoke
in favor of the report and urgedlt3
adoption.- His -expressed hope -that
the day would; come when the Philip
pines could select their, own President
and hold their -own' national conven
tion called forth three cheers. Therii
were renewed cries of "question." â¢ :

"The roll call is declined," said the
chairman, with- a thump of the -gavel.
"The chair â¢recognizes > the gentleman

to the convention," called the chair
man, as A. W. v Molina -of that delega
tion rose in his seat. ;
PERMANENT CHAIRMAN OF THE
CONVENTION AND HERO OF
THE SECOND DAY'S SESSION. .
Mr. South defended the rights of the
Philippine delegates, but finally with
drew his amendment,, arguing for the
adoption of the ' report.
Mr. Grady said the national com
mittee had decided to include Porto
Rico in. the call' of the convention.
The convention had to consider the
question as to whether these delegates
had the right to vote. The Supreme
Court of the United States decided
that Porto Rico was a part of the
territory of the United States. The
same court had decided that the Phil
ippines was not a part of the United
States.;- The committee' has followed
L. Irving Handy made the point of
order that the Philippines were no part
of the United States, and, therefore, the
amendment was not germane.
Senator Jerry South of Arkansas
moved to amend the report as soon as
it was read, so as to make it include
the Philippines. . - Â¦ :
The chairman said: "This is a most
important matter. We are about to de
termine whether the Philippine dele
gates shall be entitled to votes in our
National Convention, or whether at the
same time, we declare the Philippines
should not be a part of the United
States. 1 therefore urge you to ue
quiet, that- the motion may have full
consideration."
Mr. Grady. next read the report con
cerning Porto Rico and the Philippine
Islands, accrediting the delegates from
Porto Rico. Demands to have the re
port read were shouted from "the Min
nesota and Wisconsin delegations.
Chairman Williams sharply reprimand
ed the persistence of this demand, say
ing the report would be read if the del
egates would allow It by keeping quiet.
Immediately after the invocation
Chairman Williams called for the re
port on rules and order of business. 1 .
"The gentleman from New York is
recognized," he said.
As he concluded Delegate Thomas
Grady reported for the committee, as
heretofore published. The report was
adopted without opposition or discus
sion. â¢ " â¢
BUSINESS BEGINS.
approval ran through the convention,
which in a few seconds deepened Into
a round of applause.
The prayer was .brief, and as the
prelate resumed his Beat -a murmur | of
Come. Holy Spirit, enlighten the hearts of
the people and oour forth the fire of thy
divine love. Eend forth thy spirit. O Lord
and they ehall be created, and thou shalt
renem- the face of the earth.
In the name of the Father and the Son and
of thÂ« Holy Ghost, Amen.
There was another group about the
entrance through which the delegates
pass, and that was composed of men
with cameras taking snapshots at tho
more conspicuous ones who figure in
the convention doings.
Chairman Williams was given [ a
round of applause when he appeared.
He had made allowance for the
weather by discarding his waistcoat,
but offset this, a trifle by pinning two
extra sized badges on the outside of
his coat. He carried a large cigar be
twen his teeth, which he rolled and
chewed nervously.
The strain of his long speech of. yes
terday was evident in his voice, which
was weak and hoarse. As soon as he
had produced quiet by the .use of his
gavel he Introduced Archbishop John J.
Glennon of St. Louis, who delivered
the Invocation as follows:
Our Father who art In heaven, hallowed be
thy name, thy kingdom come, thy will be done
on earth ae it is in heaven. Give us this day
our dally bread and forgive us our trespasser
as we forgive those who trespass against us.
Lead uÂ« not Into temptation, but deliver us
from evil. Amen.
' As the opening hour was advanced
two hours the crowds in the vicinity
of the main entrance were in evidence
much earlier to-day. The scenes of
yesterday were repeated. The throngs
outside the building were largely aug
mented by the collection of those who
watched the delegates as they entered
the hall.
ST. LOUIS, July 7.â The Democratic
National Convention reconvened to
day, entering upon the second day's
session. The stirring scenes of yester
day had the effect of heightening in
terest in the assemblage of the Demo
cratic hosts. Again those having tick
ets of admission at their disposal have
been overwhelmed by those who desire
to be spectators. The disappointed ones
of yesterday redoubled their efforts,
hoping to be more successful in gaining
admission to-day.

SEATED IN CONVENTION
When the result of the convention
contest was announced the report of
the committee on permanent organiza
tion was made. Representative Champ
Clark, who was chosen permanent
chairman, addressed the convention. He
prepared and gave to the press a speech
of g-^at length. The hour was- bo late
when he gained the platform, however,
that h*> spoke about 300 words and left
his audience to read the remainder.

committees on rules, credentials and

He has had the cheers, but Parker
will pet the votes of the delegates. He
will fight the tilatform as he fought
John p. Hopkins, and he will again be
ft hero, but Parker will be nominated
on the frst ballot.
The radicals mustered onlv 300
votes and a few of them were aeainst
Hopkins and not for Bryan. Nearly
one-half of Ohio voted with Bryan
end South Carolina and Kentucky so
voted, but they will be for Parker.
But Bryan is still smiling and con
fident. He was the hero of this con
vention as much as he was the hero
of that in 1896 and that of 1900. His
i? the only presence that has inspired
Â«mthuFiasm, his the only name that
has called out wild cheers, his the
only name that has swept the people
into hysteria-
The men in control of the conserv
ative forces also felt that this would
be regarded as a test vote. The time
vas ripe for it. The hysteria in the
ealleries. the confusion in the hall,
the collapse of the presiding officer,
the weakness of the sergeant at arms,
".he necesity for calling upon the po
;ice â in fact, the apparently complete
Â«\vay of Bryanism â made it necessary
o show that Bryan had been repudi
tted and that conservatism ruled
tmong the delegates.
To have unseated Hopkins would
have been accepted by the radicals as
i victory for conservatism. It would
have been used to bolster the fast fall
r.g opposition to Judge Parker. It
*as necessary to show- that the con
servatives had control of two-thirds
r>f the delegates and that Parker
would be nominated on the first bal
lot. Sentiment and sense of justice
were cast to the winds and the ma
chine rolled over Bryan as it yester
day ignored Cleveland.
STILL, THE PARTY HERO.
The majority of the delegates did not
consider the merits of the Illinois con
test. They voted against Bryan and
relegated him and the issues he repre
bc-ntF to oblivion.
Bryan's comparison of John P. Hop
kins and B*n T. Cable to train robbers
was sensational to the galleries. There
was no reply worthy the name made to
his arraignment. Many of the most
conservative delegates admit that
Bryan was right and justified in the
ttrong language he used and that the
Hopkins delegation ought to have been
unseated; but Hopkins meant sane
democracy and the contestants repre
sented the old Bryan insanity and the
convention did not dare to be just in a
single case without the danger of do
ing injury to the whole party.
THE CASTING OUT OF BRYAN.
ST. LOUIS, July 7.â The Democratic
party is reorganized. The convention
ran over Mr. Bryan at 6 o'clock this
evening after four hours of as great a
gallery demonstration for the silver
leader as that in Chicago eight years
ago. when the same kind of a popular
outburst swept the delegates into hys
teria and nominated him for the Pres
idency.
The result to-day was a complete
demonstration of the compact organiz
ation that has been built up around
the candidacy of Judge. Parker, in the
name of conservatism, and its ability
to keep the delegates in line under the
most trying conditions. In fact, many
delegates would have voted for the
cause presented had not that cause
been tied up hopelessly with Bryan and
Eryanism.

ST. LOUIS, July 7. â The sub-committee of the Committee on Resolutions has inserted in the platform a gold standard
plank. With an overwhelming majority in the convention, the conservatives are riding over the Bryan wing rough
shod: So complete is Parker's triumph that no other names, save those of Hearst and Wall, will be presented for the
Presidential nomination. Even should- he- fall.- short', on the first rollcall, enough delegations will change their votes to
give him more than the necessary two-thirds.

FRENCH WAR MINISTER
MAY RETIRE FROM OFFICE
Meets With Defeat In the Chamber of

of Reserve Bill.
PARIS. July 7. â During the discus
sion in the Chamber of Deputies to
day of the bill reducing the term of
service of any reserve men, War Min
ister Andre was defeated, which led
to rumors of his possible retirement
from office.
In addition to the.'onevmarv first eject
ed a half dozen menin one of, the bal
conies, who were constantly interrupt
ing the speaker, were. also. put out of
the hall by the police. Senator Mar
tin of Virginia rushed up and ordered
that "the blackguards be, -put -. out,"
and the police: responded quickly.
Bryan then . arose to conclude. He
was again given' a warm welcome of
â¢cheers. Raising his hand, he made the
request that the .convention should not
take his time. Immediately, there was
silence, y " - . "â¢
; When he declared he had been at the
committee-room at 3 o'clock . in the

Resuming hjs speech, he briefly nar
rated the election of himself as chair
man of the convention and of Hop
kins and Calve as the delegates at
large and asked for fair treatment for
his side. . . . ,-
Delegate Richardson .of Alabama,
rising and addressing the chair, de
clared that it was evident that or
ganized attempt was being made to
suppress the facts in the case by pre
venting Quinn -from being heard and
the chairman again threatened to have
the galleries cleared.'
"How about gavel rule?" shouted a
voice from the rear of the hall, allud
ing to one of Bryan's sentences. \
"You want to know about gavel
rule. I'll tell you about gavel "rule,"
replied Quinn.: Before he could con
tinue a disturbance started In the-bal
cony Just back of the alternates' seats
and one disturber was', seized and
ejected by two city policemen;
During the intermission created in
Mr. Quinn's speech by this episode
John P. Hopkins walked up to the
front of the j rostrum and called to
Quinn: "Talk facts, John."
"I'll talk them," replied Quinn.
Quinn was so f recently interrupt
ed by the galleries that Chairman
Williams was forced to appeal to the
convention for him.
He was frequently interupted by the
galleries, and there were loud calls
from the delegates to have the galler
ies cleared. He declared himself, a
Democrat who believed in the 1 right 'of
the majority to rule and one who did
not call. another Democrat a thief un
less he knew him to be one. He was,
he said, defeated himself In 1896, but
did not for that reason arrogate to
himself the right to mix up in other
people's quarrels all over the country.
He declared that Bryan had read to
the convention as his minority report
the brief of one of the attorneys for
the contestants. .
The chair then recognized Frank P.
Quinn of Illinois, who ha.d fifteen min
utes Of time 'in which to conclude the
partisan debate for the contestees. He
said: i -â¢â¢Â¦.- â¢. â¢.-"Â¦. â¢:;
Gentlemen i of j the Convention: I want to
say to you that I am always a Democrat who

The result showed 047 against the
adoption of the minority report and 29'J
for it. J .. >j 1 .
The question then recurred , on the
adoption 'of the majority report. By a
viva voce vote, there being no votes
asrainst it, it was adopted amid such
confusion that the proceedings â¢ were
hardly intelligible.- . ;.;
A Michigan delegate questioned the
announcement of that State and a poll
of the delegation was taken, but the
result was not altered.
Missouri's vote for the substitute was
wildly cheered,. but this was a whisper
to the roar that went up when New
York voted solidly against the substi
tute. This vote adopted the report of
the committee and defeated the substi
tute. : Â¦
Pennsylvania voted as New York had
.voted,; and J. P." Garman of that State
demanded a poll, saying that four dele
gates had not been asked for their
votes: The poll was taken, the result
being 11 for the . substitute . and , 57
against.
John S. Rilling of Pennsylvania arosa
in his seat and announced that under
the unit rule . the *vote of the - State
should be cast according to the major
ity, vote and * the chairman sustained
him, thus throwing the State's full vote
against the minority report.
The vote was followed with intense
interest by .the delegates. Mr. Bryan
who remained on the platform while
the roll was called, gave the responses
his undivided attention, but his face
betriy # ed no sign of feeling.
Illinois requested to be passed when
its name was called.
The noes were in a heavy majority
and before the chairman announced
the result of the vote Bryan, who was
on the platform, demanded a roll call.
The demand was promptly seconded,
and the clerk proceeded with .he call.
It was the first test of strength in
the convention and was listened to
with interest.
The Hearst faction cheered every
vote in favor of the substitute and
were supported by those parts of the
gallery which had so frequently in
terrupted the anti-Hearst speakers.
BREAK IN PARKER STRENGTH.
A break in the Parker strength came
when Kentucky voted solidly for the
substitute.
By the time Mirinesota was reached
the vote stood 115 for the substitute
and 247 against.
Chairman Head of the credentials
committee, who followed, accused Bry
an of contributing little to the har
mony he was advocating. Mr. Head
admitted that there were things done
in Illinois which should not have been
done, but the committee nad weighed
the facts and its decision was fair and
unprejudiced. Before he concluded con
versation had been renewed throughout
the hallâ the convention was growing
restless.
There were loud cries of "Question"
and "Vote" as Mr. Head retired.
"The question." said the chairman,
"is on the substitution of the minority
for the majority report."
A snappy outburst of applause fol
lowed, but was not prolonged, and the
whole body, delegates and spectators,
showed plainly, the weariness born of
the intense heat and long session.
Bryan spoke In his most earnest
manner. He concluded with an ex
pression of willingness for unity, add
ing: - f
"But God forbid that it should be
under a soiled banner." Â¦Â¦ '
1 APPLAB6E NOT PROLONGED.
Bryan closed with the declaration
that, while he was willing these men
should return to the Democratic party
he did not want the loyal Democrats
forced to "walk beneath their soiled
banner."
vrstlgate the merits and by so doing said that
In some districts there was evidence to show
that questionable methods prevailed. '.

Menzies was bitter at the outset.
When he criticized Bryan for his inter
ference in the Illinois affair there- were
hoots, hisses and applause intermin
gled. Menzies was apparently some
what nettled by the interruptions and
disorder, which were rather marked, in
contrast to the close attention that had
been given Bryan. He shouted out
that he would be heard and the audi
ence would have to remain all the long
er in "this sweat box" if it persisted In
disorder. Several times as Menzies
spoke he was Interrupted by calls and
cries from the balcony just opposite the
speakers' stand, while another gallery
to his left was frequently disorderly.
Menzies concluded amid mingled ap
plause and cries of "protest." He had
spoken Just a quarter of an* hour. In
part he said:
The gentleman from Nebraska dealt In strong
language and positive assertions, I think, un
supported by facts or evidence. I would' like
to know, however, great as he Is, what has
constituted him a court of appeals to pass on a
contest in the State of Illinois, and wherein his
wisdom Is superior to that of the committee on
credentials of this convention. Great as he is
he Is not to omniscient that he can know a
case without ever having heard It.
The main question at the very pith of the
controversy Is whether the constituted authori
ties of the party acting under the forms of po
litical procedure and bound by the party, nhall
be recognized here, or whether a case based on
ex pane evidence, upon bare assertion without
facts to support It, will be recognized as a
Delegate Menzies of Indiana, a mem
ber of the credentials committee, was
then recognized in opposition to the
minority report. i ~ ?: ' \ "
AUDIENCE BECOMES UNRULY.
, Mr. Bryan occupied twenty minutes
and asked to be given ten minutes to
conclude after the other side had been
heard. The cheering which followed
his conclusion lasted several minutes,
and the audience showed a disposition
to become unruly.
"I shall ask the police to attend to
persons persisting in the disturbance/',
declared Chairman Williams. Then,
pointing his finger over to the left, he
demanded: "Officer, go over. to that
West Virginia banner and. if that man
does not desist from his disturbance
take him out."
The chairman's firmness had the de
sired effect. ; â¢
ARRAIGNS QUINN'S METHODS.
Bryan severely arraigned the meth
ods of State Chairman Quinn and Con
vention Chairman Quinn in suppress
ing opponents in the State convention
and appealed for rah- treatment of the
Illinois Democrats. He continued:
That convention was so openly, so notori
ously a gang-ruled and gang-run convention
that two or the men who had been out and
had made a canvass in the State for Governor
refused to be candidates before that conven
tlon. And I honor Judjre Prcntlss of Chicago
and Mayor Crolius of Jollet. I honor these
men who refused to go out as candidates of
that convention, and If Hopkins and Cable had
any respect for the rights of a majority to
rule they (would be ashamed to be here.- the
representative o f a minority. But, my friends.
If they havÂ« not learned to be ashamed â¢ to
misrepresent a great State you ought to teach
them that they cannot do it with the approval
of the Democratic party of the United States.
Mow their Â«ln â¢ rests -upon these men. You do
not bear It. But when you. if you do. decide
to seat these men. these delegates from tho
districts against the evidence presented in
regard to the contestants from the districts
and these two national delegates In spite of
Â£71 members â if you do that you take from
the shoulders of Hopkins and Cable and Quinn
the odium that they bear and put It upon the
Democratic party of the nation and Indorse
that Ettempt.
You have not this condition in other States
to-day, but let this convention Indorse this
conduct and the next national convention will,
see more than one State here as the result of'
gavel rule. And It is because this question
transcends the Interests of any State or any
candidate or any faction that I am here to
present the minority report and to ask you to
do to the Democrats of ' Illinois the justice
that this gang denied them, deliberately and
insolently.
As Mr. Bryan concluded he was
greeted by an outburst of cheers.
And these men who planned It and who
carried it out have the audacity, the Im
pudence and the Insolence to say that because
they certify that what they did was regular
you cannot go" Whind". thelf:' certificates. If
that Is good law* In a Democratlo convention
It ought to be .good doctrine . In a court, and
If it Is good doetine in a eourt then the only
thing that train robbers have to do in thft

THREE "FAVORITE SONS" WHOSE STATE DELEGATIONS ARE BOOMING THEM FOR THE VICE PRESIDENTIAL. NOM
INATION AT ST. LOUIS. EX-SENATOR TURNER HAS THE SUPPORT OF DEMOCRATS FROM THE NORTH PACIFIC
COAST AND A PORTION OF THE NORTHWESTERN STATES.
That committee at once announced
that it would not be prepared to re
port until 2 o'clock.
The chair recognized WllHam F.
Sheehan of New York, who moved that
a recess be taken until 2 o'clock.
The convention was Instantly In an
uproar of confusion as the delegates
and visitors rose to leave.
The motion to take & recess was
greeted by a viva voce vote and the
morning session came to a close at
11:04 a. m.
Mr. Williams created great laughter
when he said: "So dreadful are the
acoustic properties of this remarkable
meeting place that my friend Olli*
James, of Kentucky, who haÂ» a voice
like the bull of Basham. and in whos<*
defense that bull retired from business,
confided to me that even he could not
be heard in this place."
"The next thing in the order of busi
ness," said the chairman, "is the re
port of the committee on credentials.
Will the chairmen of the delegations
pass that along?"
"I suggest." said John Cadwallader
of Pennsylvania, "that the megaphone
be adopted."
"Well, will you get the megaphone?"
retorted the chairman.
The clerk made a second ajinotmce
ment of the call for the credentials re
port.
This witticism from the chairman hi*
the humor of the convention and a pro
longed laugh followed.
Â¦The chairman then announced that
the permanent organization committee
was not ready to make a report, ami
desired a confprence of the committee.
Because of the wretched acoustics of
the hall. Chairman Williams requested
the chairmen of the New York and Illi
nois delegations to repeat all an
nouncements.
WINS A LMOH.
Chairman Williams endeavored lo
state that the clerk would make an
announcement, but was interrupt*- 1
by cries of "louder."
"In the day when the Angel Gabriel
shall stand on the highest mount of
the world." said the chairman, "an.1
with a megaphone shall announce the
crash of creation, there will be some
body to interrupt him by crying
'Louder.' "
Continued From Pace f, Column 4.
POBTfl RICO DELEGATES-ARE SEAIEO
The chairman then put the question
as to the adoption of the report of the
committee on credentials, with the ex-
Delegate Sutro of the Philippine
delegation requested to be heard.
Chairman Williams ruled that he had
no right to recognize him. This ruling
seemed to meet the approval of the
convention, as cries of "Right, right!"
were peneral. though the galleries be
pan a fresh clamor and threats to clear
them were again made.
Chairman Williams followed his rul
ing against hearing the Philippine del
egation with declaring that part of the
report of the committee dealing with
the Philippines out of order.
His ruling was: "So much of the re
port of the committee on credentials as
admits to this floor as representing a
part of th* United States the Philip
pine Islands, declared by the Supreme
Court of the United States not to be a
part of the United States, is out of or
der."
He was at once followed by Dele
gate Grady of New York, who made
a vigorous protest against that part of
the report relating to the Philippine
Islands.
Delegate Keyes of California, how
ever, made a louder demand and was
recognized to move the seating of the
contestants from the District of Co
lumbia.
A delegate from Vermont moved
that the chairman order the galleries
cleared unless better order was ob
served. Chairman Williams at once
announced that he would do that un
less the galleries refrained from dis
turbing the convention.
When Mr. Head moved the adoption
of the report. Chairman Williams ask
ed if there was a demand for a divi
sion on the question.
Mr. Bryan endeavored to address
the chair.
Mr. Head is the fortunate possessor
of a voice of strong carrying power
and his reading restored greater quiet
than had existed up to the time he
commenced to speak. No sign of ap
proval or disapproval greeted the de
cisions of the committee. He an
nounced that a minority report had
been submitted in the case of the Dis
trict of Columbia and he understood
one was to be submitted in the Illi
nois case.
As soon as the band was through
Mr. Head read the report, which was
in line with the decisions already pub
lished. The report declared in favor
of seating all the delgates who were
on the temporary roll call, with the ex
ception of Alfred Orendorf. who was
substituted for Duncan C. Best in the
Twentv-nrst Illinois District.
A POWERFUL VOICE.
The secretary yelled: "The chair re
quests the band to play 'Yankee
Doodle.* " and cheer after cheer broke
forth as the band played the favorite
anthem in march time.
Other selections followed and "Mary
land" was the signal for another
hearty cheer, many voices throughout
thÂ«5 hall joining in the refrain. At this
moment Mr. Head, chairman of the
committee on credentials, entered the
hall a.nd made his way to the platform,
to the apparent relief of the chair
man.
The band then struck up "Dixie"
and a miphty roar went up. the Philip
pine delegation adding to the scene
by unfurling its American flag, with
Philippfne streamers floating from the
top.
Chairman Head of the committee on
credentials had not yet put in an ap
pearance with the majority report, and
Delegate Kerr of Pennsylvania was de
spatched for him.
In the meantime, amid great confu
sion. Delegate Robinson of Alabama
jumped to his chair and shouted a mo
tion that, pending the arrival of Mr.
Head with the report. Governor Beck
ham of Kentucky address the conven
tion. This motion was put throuph
the megaphone and declared carried.
It was pome moments before Governor
Beckham was heard from and when
he was he requested to be excused.
A motion was then adopted that
Bourke Cockran of New York be asked
to address the convention. The secre
tary announced through the mega
phone that Mr. Cockran was not in the
hall. He then called, "The band will
kindly strike up some tune."
The band was quick to respond with
"The Star-fpangled Banner," and the
entire convention stood.
his arms frantically and another out
burst of applause occurred, but it was
of Phort duration. Mr. Bryan's object
in going to the platform was to present
a minority report to the credentials
committee. He is a member of the
committee by proxy, bearing that of
1)â¬ legate Casper of Nebraska. When
Mr. Bryan was fully on the platform
the spectators in the galleries to the
rear gave him a cheer. He turned
around and made many bows.
CHAIRMAN HELM) ABSENT.
Continued From Page 1, Column 6.
In the , State of Illinois the majority was
not allowed to rule. That convention was
dominated by a clique of men who deliberately,
purposely, bodily trampled on the right* of
tbÂ« people of Illinois. My friends, the evi
dence shows that so band of train robbers
And. my friends, It Is because I want the
Democratic party on the Jeffersonlan principle
ef majority that I come here and present the
minority report in this case.
I still hope that we shall be able to agree
upon a platform that will represent the senti
ments of all of us so that we can present it
to the country as the platform of a united
party. I will go further than that. I stlfi
hope that we shall be able to present to the
country a ticket behind which can stand a
united party. And I regret that I am com
pelled to come In at this time and present
a subject upon which your votes will be asked.
But if there Is one Democratic principle " more
fundamental than another It Is the right of a.
majority to rule. If you destroy the binding
force of that principle there . is nothing that
can bold a party together.
"When the cheers which greeted this
sentiment had subsided the speaker ut
tered these words:
"I will go further than that. I still
hope that we shall be able to present
to the country a ticket behind which
we can stand as a united party."
Again the convention unanimously
indorsed the sentiment expressed. Mr.
Bryan's full speech was as follows:
I came to this convention In the hope that
we would be able to agree on platform, on
candidates, and have nothing to stir the feel
ings or rouse contention.
TICKET BRYAN WANTS.
"I still hope that we shall be able to
agree upon a platform that will rep
resent the sentiments of all of ub, ho
we can present to the country the
platform of a united party."
He declared that two years ago John
P. Hopkins had pursued a course con
trary to that followed in the Illinois
convention and did not dare to follow
precedent this time because he would
have been repudiated if he had done
so. The initial sentences of Mr. Bry
an's speech, which carried his hearers
into cheers, were:
Becoming Intensely interested in his
address, Mr. Bryan, finding that his
cuffs interfered with the free move
ment of his hands, pulled them off and
proceeded.
An outburst of approving yells
greeted his announcement that the
convention In Illinois was conducted
by men who were on a level with train
robbers. *
In opening his speech Mr. Bryan an
nounced that he had not come to the
convention with the idea of bringing
up any question that could or would
cr*te division. He was greeted by
chflers, and when he declared that he
hoped and believed that the conven
tion would select a ticket which could
be supported by a united Democracy
the cheers were redoubled.
APPROVING YELLS.
Word that Mr. Bryan would take this
opportunity to make his great effort
before the convention had got abroad
and the audience rustled with expec
tation as the Nebraskan arose and
faced it.
Mayor D. S. Rose of Milwaukee asked
what had led up to these contests in
Illinois, and was informed that he was
not proposing a parliamentary inquiry.
The chairman then recognized Mr
Bryan.
Chairman Uead of the credentials
committee claimed his right to have
the closing statement in the debate
The chair ruled that Mr. Bryan should
take fuch time as he should choose
and announced that the other side
should have as much time as Mr. Brya n
took.
The chairman recognized Mr. Bryan
to speak in behalf of his motion to sub
stitute the minority for the majority
report.
He was accorded most respectful at
tention, however, by the convention and
succeeded better, than any other speak
er in making himself heard.
Mr. Bryan concluded reading the re
port at 4:12, it having taken him thir
ty-five minutes. During the latter part
of the report he was frequently inter
rupted by cheers from the gallery.
He closed by asking that fifteen min
utes on each side be allowed for the
hearing of the contest.
In a moment he had the cheering
checked and began threading of the
report. His voice was clear and he was
heard plainly, although not using ex
traordinary force. The convention re
mained in attentive silence, which was
emphasized by comparison with the
wild confusion that had prevailed al
most continuously since the convention
began its first outbreak at 2 o'clock.
Mr. Bryan's report was a long, type
written document which he read delib
erately. Its dryness began to impress
the galleries after the reading had pro
gressed ten minutes and the hum of in
attention began to be heard.
CHECKS CHEERING.
This was enough to start up the
Bryan cheer again, but Mr. Bryan at
once beckoned ' for silence with his
right hand, while he held his minority
report on the Illinois contests in his
left.
"The chair now recognizes Mr. Bryan
in the matter of the contests from the
State of Illinois."
The report of the committee was
adopted without further delay, and Mr.
Williams turned to Mr. Bryan and
said:
Chairman Head replied to the advo
cates of a division of the vote, saying
that he hoped the convention would
eliminate the District of Columbia from
being a further source of trouble to the
national executive body. On the viva
voce vote Chairman Williams anounced
that the noes had it.
There were but one or two affirma
tive votes, while the negative vote
sounded like "No!" from the whole
convention.
A series of explanations followed and
the motion to lay upon the table was
withdrawn- and the question reverted
to the adoption of the amendment to
seat both delegations with a half vote
each.
ception of those parts on which a sep
arate vote was requested. The report
was adopted with this condition. A
separate vote then was demanded in
the casTof the District of Columbia
and in the Illinois cases.
Mr. Schultheis of the District of Co
lumbia was then recognized and spoke
for the contestants. He offered an
amendment providing that the contest
ing delegates from the District of Co
lumbia be seated with a half vote to
each.'
A motion was made that the amend
ment be laid- on the table, pn this a
rising vote was demanded.
The chairman called for a rising vote
and cries arose from all parts of the
hall that the delegates did not under
stand what was before the convention.
Then they had a credentials committee made
ui\ and, as far as Dosslble, had the district
members of the credentials committee taken
from the contestants, whom they had seated.
This credentials committee, without Intention
The report which, in the convention
this afternoon, Bryan. moved as a sub
stitute for the majority report, began
thus:. '
Illinois has a State Central Committee- with
one John P. Hopkins at Its head. Finding
iUelf In a minority In the State convention,
the said committee deliberately planned to
override the Democratic vote of the State and
secured by fraud and Intimidation a majority
of the delegates to the St. Louis convention.
To this end they brought contests In a num
ber of districts outside of those controlled by
the satd committee and placed their own men
upon the temporary roll call of the ' conven
tion.
The report concluded by recommend
ing that the Indian Territory and Okla
homa each be allowed to elect eight
delegates and eight alternates to repre
sent them in the next Democratic Na
tional Convention in view of the large
increase In their population.
BRYAN'S MINORI"-* REPORT.
Your committee desires to say that It
realizes, as this convention must, that it was
absolutely Impossible for this committee to
have done more. In the limited time which it
could possibly give to this great number of
contests, than examine the- principal questions
Involved and dispose of them In such manner
as* In its Judgment would nearest meet the
ends of justice and best subserve the Interests
of the Democratic party In those States and
Territories ! and In the Island* where the con
testa arose. There, were filed with this com
mittee arguments, briefs, records, affidavits
and telegrams In Â¦ several of those contests
which would have been Impossible for your
committee to have even read In less than ten
days. The committee gave to each of the con
testants and contestees who desired to appear
before It all the time It was possible to give
and In each case endeavored to ascertain as
nearly as could be all the important facts
bearing- upon each contest. In the State of
Illinois. . however, the several contesting Con
gressional districts were asked to select those
to speak for all the contests In that State.
In, the matter of the contests from the
Second Third. Sixth, Eighth. Tenth. Eleventh,
Twelfth, Fifteenth. Sixteenth. Eighteenth.
Twenty-third and Twenty-fifth districts and
the seats of Ben T. Cable and John P. Hop.
kins from the State at large. In Illinois, your
committee recommends that the delegation* as
named by the National Committee are entitled
to seats as the regularly accredited delegates
and alternates.
In the matter ot the contests from the
Twenty-first District of the State of Illinois,
your committee reports that Alfred Orendorff.
and A. B. Carman as delegates and J. N. C.
Shumway and Jesse F. Griffin as alternates
are entitled to seats In this convention as the
properly accredited delegates and alternates.
In the matter of the representation which
the island of Porto Rico and the Philippine
Islands shall have In this convention, your
committee recommends that, each of said Isl
ands be accredited with six delegates and six
alternates.
In those States and Territories -where no
contests have been filed we carefully examined
the original credentials of the delegates and
alternates and find the same to have been
correctly 'certified to the chairman of the
National Committee and the roster as prepared
by the chairman and secretary and submitted
to this committee for Its temporary organiza
tion is correct and accurate and we unani
mously recommend Its adoption by this con
vention.
The committee adjourned at 4:30
o'clock after finishing all contests be
fore it and authorising its chairman
and secretary to prepare and present
the following report:
Â¦ The -committee did not disturb the
sitting delegation, of which Pettigrew
is the head.
REPORT OF THE MAJORITY.
In the Ohio contest, involving the
Twelfth Congressional District. Ross
and Gilliam, who had obtained seats at
the hands of the national committte.
retained them.
Â¦ The sitting members in the Pennsyl
vania contest were retained without ar
gument on either side.
- H. H. Smith -of South Dakota con
tested the seats of the entire delegation
from that State. He charged Pettigrew
with being opposed to any but a Hearst
or Bryan man. and quoted the follow
ing language, which he said Pettigrew
had 'used in the State convention in an
swer to a Question as to whether he
would bolt the national convention:
Â¦ Do you suppose I would pledge myself to
support the nominee of -the St. Louis con
vention? I put the question to you. gentle
men. Suppose they nominate old Cleveland
or some other man In the Cleveland-Hill ring
of the Democratic party. Suppose they re
organize us and nominate a Republican on a
Republican platform, declaring for trusts and
thÂ» money power. I tell you that I would
bolt the ticket and do everything in my power
to defeat It at the polls.
It was 3 o'clock when the New Jersey
cases had been disposed of. Bryan had
been waiting in the committee-room
for some time. He at once took the floor
and requested that the Illinois contests,
which had been disposed 'of by the com
mittee early in the session, be recon
sidered, that a record vote might he
had on which to base a minority report.
The chairman explained that such a
course would not be necessary, that any
member of the committee had the right
to make a minority report. To make
the matter regular, however, the com
mittee voted the privilege of making
such a report to such of its members as
desired to unite in one. Bryan again
took the initiative, as no member of tfc<>
committee indicated a desire to make
a minority report. He 6aid that he
wanted to make such a report, and
asked all members of the committee
who would sign his report to stand up.
Responding to this, the members from
Oklahoma, Wisconsin. Minnesota and
Rhode Island arose. Bryan thanked
the committee and at once withdrew,
with the statement that he would draw
a minority report and make the fi^ht
on the floor of the convention.
The Maine contest, involving three
seats, was decided against the Hearst
delegates and in favor of those on the
temporary roll.
The New Jersey contests were de
cided In the same way.
BUYAX* TAKES A HAND.
The committee gave patient hearing
to every contest presented except that
of Dr. Mary Walker, who claimed a.
seat in the convention as the woman
representative of the Democrats of Nov
York.. Dr. Mary waited patiently the
indulgence of the committee until a late
hour and then gave up in despair.
The committee took action regarding
Porto Rico, the Philippines, the Dis
trict of Columbia, Illinois. Maine. New
Jersey, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Da
kota and the InVlian Territory.
The feature of the session was the
declaration of W. J. Bryan, who paid
the committee a call at 3 o'clock this
morning, that he would make the Illi
nois contests an Issue on the floor of
the convention.
ST. LOUIS. July 7.â With the excep
tion of the contest in the Twenty-first
Illinoi3 District, the credentials com
mittee of the Democratic National Con
vention followed the lead of the nation
al committee and seated the delegates
recommended in the temporary roll of
the convention. This result was accom
plished after a session lasting all night.
The report says that the contestants
supported their case by Hundreds of
affidavits and hundreds of pases* of
documentary evidence, but that the
contestees offered no affidavits and no
documentary evidence except the re
port of the convention officers and no
evidence at all but that of their own
unsupported oral statements. The re
port concludes:

ESOPUS. N. Y.. July 7.-Judge Par
ker received a letter to-day from the
West in which he is Informed of a plot
against his life. The writer, who oro
fesses to be in the confidence of some
mysterious band, cautions the iurist
to remain at home and protect himself
against -bodily injury. He writes that
"certain persons in the West" are plan
ning to take advantage of the first ot>
portunity to make an assault upon the
Judge and adds that in subsequent let
ters he will keep Parker informed of
the movements of the alleged con
spirators.
There is a vague hint that plotters
are going to carry the threats into
execution when Judge Parker is on the
railroad train or in a carriage and
when he would most likely be without
protection against sudden attack.
In consequence the writer warns
Judge Parker to remain at home. but.
if he should find it necessary to make
a trip, to surround himself with .a body
guard.
The letter is so vague and discon
nected that Judge Parker is satisflrd
that the writer's mind is disordered.

to withdraw it. Tarpey was busily oc

withdraw at this time and direct his
manager. M. F. Tarpey. to mak? an ef
fort to stampede the convention to Ol
ney or some other candidate that would
please the many delegates that favor
neither Hearst nor Parker. California
is popular in the convention, and
though it is not probable that her dele
gation could accomplish the desired re
sult, it would certainly lighten the in
evitable tumble that awaits.
TARPEY STANDS FIRM.
The more they heard to-day the more
the uneasiness of the Hearst managers
seemed to increase. It soon began to
be evident that the shackles of instruc
tion were beginning to chafe. Many of
the delegates, especially the southern
ers, began to complain of the compact
that bound them and agreed that a res
olution of indorsement would have bet
ter demonstrated intelligence on the
part of the Santa Cruz convention than
did the one definitely instructing the
delegation for Hearst.
"It is none of your affair what I am
trying to do." answered Spellacy. "I
am not here under instruir^tons and
I shall exercise my freedom."
Hearst's adviser retired. The in
cident has been discussed with amuse
ment all day.
The appearance of Tim Spellacy of
Bakersfleld at headquarters to-day oc
casioned an incident that throws a litv
tie light upon the approach of tKT
Hearst collapse. One of the Hearst
advisers sought out Spellacy and said:
"I understand you are here trying
to line up delegates against Hearst's
interests."
HEADQUARTERS CALIFORNIA
DELEGATION, ST. LOUIS. July 7.â
California's banner waved to-day in
the first tremendous demonstration of
the convention. The entry of William
Jennings Bryan, still the idol of the
Democracy, at the opening of the aft
ernoon session, let loose the floodgates
of enthusiasm and the great Coliseum
seemed to rock from the roar of 10,000
throats. Banners soon began to wave
besides that of Nebraska, and finally,
out of the alternate's inclosure, crept
the standard of California. It was the
tribute of the West to the policy of the
radical.
This demonstration served to disclose
to the interested the new location of
the Californlans. During the morning
session Joseph Simons of Los Angeles
had thrice raised his voice in protest
against the location of the Californians
in the rear of the delegates' inclosure
and thrice he had been ordered to sit
down. His dignity ruffled, but still per
sistent, Simons forced his way through
the crowded aisle and mounted the
platform. Then, into the ear of the
temporary chairman, he poured his
protest. He was ordered to reduce his
wail to writing.
â¢ Delegates Carmichael and McGee
were appointed a committee to fight
the question through and they suc
ceeded. The opening of the afternoon
session found the Californians outside
the delegates* rail, within the inclos
ure of the alternates, and within hear
ing distance of a megaphoned voice.
TIM SPELLACY APPEARS.
Delmas. who represents California
on thi3 committee, was anxious to rest
and Tarpey took his place. Thus did
more honors fall to the chairman vt
California's delegation.
After he left the meeting of the com
mittee on platform and resolution*
Tarpey said:
"If there is any rumor afloat to the
effect that any man's name will be
withdrawn, it is absolute nonsense.
It will he every man for his own can
didate and California for Hearst from
the first ballot to the last."
AH outward evidence of the friction
that exists between the delegates has
disappeared. They are conducting
themselves with becoming decorum,
but the undercurrent of passion may
at any time sweep to destruction the
bark that now bears the delegation's
dignity.
Congressman Edward J. Uvemash
and Michael Casey visited headquar
ters to-day, but they did not enter Into
thÂ» political discussion.
Frank H. Short of Fresno and J. J.
Dwyer of San Francisco were also
around as visitors. As .guests of the

On the** propositions we believe we are right
and on them we confidently rely in our appeal
to the American people in November.
Recognizing the fact that a large portion of
our revenue has always bwn raised from cus
tnme duties or taxes. Democrats divide all im
ports into three classes â necessaries, comforts
and luxuriesâ and contend that the tariff taxes
should be highest on luxuries, lower on comforts
end lowest or ncne at all en the necessaries.
They furthermore say that taxes should be uni
form on all articles belonging to one clasji.
u* t J*V n " democratic party's position, from
which IT will not be driven or bullied. No
amount of misrepresentation will cause them
to budge frcm that position. We say further
more that not one doilar more In shape of
tariff taxes or any other sort of taxes should be
taken from the people than is necessary to pay
the expenses of an economically administered
government.
Of a piece with the foregoing false pretenses
is that other one that Democrats would destroy
American industries. There is not a syllable
of truth in it. Why should they desire to de-
Ftroy industries? They are vitally interested in
maintaining them and they wish to we them
ell prosper by giving them all an equal chance
and not by fostering some at the expense of
others.
The true Democratic position on the tariff Is
this:
Will he or some other stand-patter explain
why Americans should be mads to pay one
third morÂ« for American steel rails than thÂ«
Citizens of other nations fcr them?
He may answer as did Mr. Representative
OlmÂ»tead of Pennsylvania, that the railroad
companies pay for the steel rails and that It is
the business of nobody else how much they pay
for them, but Olmstead had more courage than
information, for everybody with two Ideas
above a Hottentot knows that everybody that
travels on a railroad, everybody that ships
anything on one. everybody that uaes anything
so chipped helps pay for the steel rails. ThÂ«
raiiroad companies foot the bills in the first
lnÂ«ancÂ« and then make their customers repay
them with Interest at the highest rate the
traffic will bear.
Choose ye between us in November.

On the occasion -with which the story

through the open window. Jocko was
making a good race, but a losing one.
He was in the corner quaking with
fear and very near to death's door
when the pursuer confronted the pic

than it craves monkeys and that par

but the chair bo held and Cook ap
pealed from the decision.
John F. Mullen roared. He roared so
hard that Hickey's mallet was making

Th*> last meeting of the committee re
solved to use the old constitution and

Cook, as onÂ«Â» member of the commit

"The amount of money spent by Mr.
Hearst at the finish will represent ap
proximately the sum for which he
mortgaged his New York newspapers.
How much of this money was actual
ly spent in endeavoring to further the
candidate's interests will never be
known. It is computed by wise ones
that many hundreds of thousands or
dollars have not yet been spent at all,
though separated forever from Mr.
Hearst.
NEW YORK, July 7.â Th.e World haa
the following from St. Louis:
"W. R. Hearst's high tide in the con
vention will show not more than 150
votes, and probably desertions between
now and the voting will lower these
figures. One hundred and fifty votes
will be the net result of a campaign
expenditure of $1,400,000 In round num
bers. Until the time the caravan of
Hearst boomers reached St Louis the
campaign had cost the Californian
$100,000 short of the foregoing sum, and
in admitting the heavy outlay Hearst's
friends said that he expected to spend
$100,000 here. Comparing expenses and
net returns, it will be seen that each
vote in the convention will have cost
Mr. Hearst about $9333.
"The extraordinary cost is attribut
ed to the fact that Mr. Hearst is a
novice in politics and to the further
fact that his managers and advisers
are for the most part green hands in
the political battlefield. While a con
gregation of personal friends, newspa
per employers and mercenaries have
essayed practical politics, considering
money the root of office, they are said
to have signally failed when met by
political wiudom with age on it.
"One instance is pointed out as indi
cating the supernatural political
knowledge of Hearst's most active
lieutenant. This clever and robust
young man went to see a hard-faced
Tammany Jeader to 'arrange things.'

\\ e should bear In mind, in short.' these two
things: First the general principle that the
sole object of the power of taxation is the sup
port of the Federal Government economically,
effectively and constitutionally administered,
and. second, the equal truth that in the asser
tion of any general principle and In righting
any ultimate end. however sacredly and logical
ly unavoidable, due regard must and should be
paid to actually existing conditions.
â¢i. We favor the reduction of tariff taxa
tion upon trust produced articles to the point
where foreign competition may enter the
American market whenever trusts and com
ics, seeking monopoly, raise their prices to
tm> American consumer above a reasonable and
just profit, by such reduction depriving trusts
and monopolies of the power to extort from
the American people, under shelter of Ameri
can law. prices higher than those charged for
eigners for identical articles.
We favor a wise, conservative and business
like revision and a gradual reduction of the
tariff by the friends of the masses and for the
commonwealth and not by the friends of Its
abuses, its extortions and Its discriminations,
keeping in view the ultimate end of "equality
of burdens and equality of opportunities" and
the constitutional purpose of raising a revenue
by taxation, to wit: the support of Re Fed
eral Government. In all its integrity and
virility, and keeping also In view existing con
ditions, however wrongfully, mistakenly or
unjustly brought about, and the danger to the
caus? of tariff reform itself of abrupt reversal
of policy. â¢
REVISION* OF THE TARIFF.
Thpse publicly favored enterprises have been
converted into monopolies, thus bringing to
an end domestic comDetitlon, which was the
only check upon the extravagant profits made
possible by the protective system. These In
dustrial combinations, by the financial assist
ance they can give, now control the policy of
the Republican party.
3. We favor ' the nomination and election
of a President trained in the ways of the
constitution, who shall place his face sternly
against corruption of legislation and Judicial
functions, whether veiled under the guise of
executive construction of existing laws or
whether it take refuge In the assertion of
surÂ»erlor whims.
4. The Democratic party ha> been and will
continue to be the consistent opponent of that
class of tariff legislation by which certain in
dividuals have been permitted, through Con
gressional favor, to draw a heavy tribute from
the American people. This monstrous per
version of those equal opportunities which our
institutions were established to secure has
caused what may once have been Infant In
dustries to become the greatest combinations
of capital that the world has ever known.
1- Large reductions can readily be made In
the annual expenditure of the Government
without Impairing the efficiency of any branch
of the public service, and we shall insist upon
the strictest economy and frugality compatible
with vigorous and efficient civil, military and
naval administration a* a right of the people
too clear to be denied or withheld.
2. The enforcement ot honesty in the public
service and thorough legislative Investigation
of those departments of the Government al
ready known to teem with corruption, as well
as other departments suspected of harboring
corruption and the punishment of ascertained
cnrruptlonlsts without fear or favor or regard
to persons. The persistent and deliberate r}
fv!Eal of the Senate and House of Representa
tives to permit such investigation to be made
by either branch of Congress demonstrates that
only by a change In the executive can com-*
plete exposure and punishment of corruption
b-> obtained. The Government should not per
mit Itself to be robbed by entering Into con
tracts with convicted trusts or unlawful com
binations in restraint of Interstate trade. We
believe that one of the best methods of pro
curing economy and honesty in the public
service is to have public officials return as
nearly as may be to Jeffersonian simplicity
of living.

(Delayed In transmission.) â The Jap
anese swarmed over the- mountain

Russian vanguard to fall back. A
whole brigade of Japanese, with
masses of cavalry, followed and oc
cupied the village of Xantay, driving
out two companies of Rusisan Infan
try and two companies of Cossacks,
who were entrenched there. The Jap
anese arived within five miles of â¢ Kai

Samsonoff made a heroic attempt to

he fell back and is now holding Kai

ST. PETERSBURG, July 7, . 5:03
p. m. â The War Office denies that a
jattle is in progress as reported by the
Liacjyang correspondent of the London
Telegraph, who in a dispatch says
that a Revere battle was proceeding
twenty-five miles from there and a
number, of wounded were being
brought in from the mountains. The
officials of the War Office say .that
the correspondent probably referred
to the reconnaissance In force made
by Lieutenant General Count Keller
July 4 in the direction of Motien Pass,
east of Liaoyang. full details of which
were telegraphed the same day in a
long dispatch from General Sakharoff,
to whose army General Keller's corps
belongs. General Sakharoff reported
that the Russians lost more than 200
officers or men In killed or Wounded.
The report of the Daily Telegraph cor
respondent was doubtless due to his
seeing the stream of wounded brought
In.
The War Office has no news of fur
ther fighting of importance.
Russian Officials Discredit Report of
an Engagement Near Liaoyang.
DEN~Y STORY OF A BATTLE.
From a thoroughly reliable source it
has been learned that ammunition at
Port Arthur is plentiful, and j at the
present rate of consumption It probably
will last longer than the provisions sup
ply. There are enough of the latter to
last one year. Chinese say the en
trance to the harbor of Port Arthur is
unsafe for the passage of vessels. One
Russian warship was slightly damaged
while coming out recently, as a result
of striking a sunken wreck, and two
other warships collided in the entrance
and had to undergo repairs. '
CHEFU, July 7 (noon).â In fighting
which occurred on July 4 for the pos
session of one of the hills northeast of
Port Arthur the Russians lost accord
ing to Chinese one hundred men killed
and fifty men wounded. Fifty Chinese
were sent out to bring in the Russian
dead and wounded.
The Japanese, having occupied the
second range of hills around Port Ar
thur, are now massing men to march
on the Russian marine camp that com
mands the principal pass through the
hills, which Is directly back of Port Ar
thur. This camp is considered vital to
the safety of the fortress, and it Is
guarded, according to the Chinese, by
twenty thousand marines and sailors.
In the Chino-Japanese war the Japan
ese occupied this land for seven days
before they took Port Arthur.
The last junk to leave Port Arthur
was towed out of the harbor, and her
passengers were compelled to remain
below until she had cleared the harbor
entrance. This measure was adopted
to prevent the passengers from obtain
ing knowledge of conditions at the en
trance to the harbor.

One Hundred Russians Killed In Fight
SUFFER A HEAVY LOSS.
According to official information re
ceived by the War Office the Japanese
began their advance toward Liaoyan?
June 29, one column moving along the
main and the other over the direct
road, the former reaching . Ouhfang
kou, ten miles beyond Fenshui Pass,
and the latter reaching Llaokhol Pass,
twelve miles northwest of the Motien
Pass. They halted at these points un
til July 3, the Russians falling back to
Langtse Pass, thirty miles from Liao
yang. The Japanese advance guard,
consisting of 1500 men, was only two
miles east of the Russian position. The
next day occurred Keller's reconnais
sance in force, when the Japanese were
discovered to be trying a flank move
ment in the direction of Liandiansian.
This is the last fighting reported north
ward, but still farther north a Japan
ese column is continuing to hold an
other Fenshui Pass, twelve miles
northwest of Saimatsza, on the road
leading to Liaoyang and Mukden and
857 miles east of the latter place. At
this time the Japanese main forces are
on the Siuyen-Haicheng and Kaichou-
Tatchekiao roads, at Vandiapudze and
Ahiaheouya, respectively, thirty-seven
miles from Haicheng and fifty miles
from Tatchekiao and Kaichou.
ST. PETERSBURG, July 7, 1:06 p. m.
It is reported that the Emperor will
leave St. Petersburg Saturday for the
Volga region and will visit Kaizan,
Penza, Samara and Syzran to bid fare
well to the Fifth and Sixfli Siberian
army corps, which will be held In re
serve at Irkutsk and Omsk.
Many false reports concerning the
war operations are being sent abroad;
these the Japanese welcome as being
just so much more chaff and sand In
the eyes of the enemy.
The curtain now down over the
theater of war will, however, soon be
raised, and it is confidently expected
that the lifting will reveal the Japan
ese to be in possession of splendid
strategical advantages, with men and
guns enough to carry the present cam
paign to a successful conclusion.
TOKIO, July 7, 11 a. m. â Opera
tions of paramount importance are go
ing on within the war zone, but the
Government succ.eeds in veiling them
In almost absolute secrecy. Since the
occupation of Port Dalny the Govern
ment officials have been silent con
cerning conditions at Port Arthur. It
is generally known, however, that the
Japanese army and navy are daily
tightening their relentless grip on the
besieged city, and that a final assault,
followed by the fall of the fortress, is
now only a matter of a few weeks. Â¦.
It is known also that engagements
of varying importance are constantly
occurring on the hills surrounding
Port Arthur. The fleet of Admiral Togo
is in motion day and night and is fre
quently engaged, but the forces and
number of guns of the besiegers, aa
well as their positions, details of past
operations and future plans are secrets
which probably will not be revealed
until the final and decisive action.
Fragmentary information from vari
ous sources, especially Chinese,
reaches Japan, but its publication here
or the sending of it abroad is forbid
den under severe penalty.
Xo foreigner accompanies either the
Japanese forces which are besieging
Port Arthur, the army under General
Oku, or the army which was landed at
Takushan, and the newspaper corre
spondents and foreign attaches with
General Kuroki are made to remain
within a circle having a radius of a
little more than half a mile.
The Russians are forced to travel
afield along, a Japanese front which
extends for 250 miles in order to deter
mine, by actual scouting, the positions
and the strength of their enemy, and
added to this they must discount a
series of clever feints and ruses de
signed to deceive them.
The name Takushan used in this
despatch to designate a mountain near
Port Arthur means "lonely mountain."
and this meaning accounts for the
frequent use of the word.
The Russians say also that in an
other engagement between outposts
eight Japanese were killed and sev
enty-two were taken prisoners. These
reports lack confirmation.
The Russian troops at Port Arthur
ETi!l believe that an army is march-
Is? south to relieve them.
It has been learned here that only
ere division of the Japanese army un
Â£er General Oku occupied Kaiping.
Another division of this armv is
marching a'.or.g the old Foochou road,
which turr.s to the northwest at Kai
pir.p and continues to Tinkow (th?
port of Newchwang). There probably
will be an encounter between this lat
ter division and Russian forces at
Erhtambo. This report was received
from Xewchwang.
A third division of General Oku's
army is proceeding along the east side
of the railroad track and is acting in
co-operation with the division which is
or: the railroad.
Fort Number Sixteen, which is on
the main line of the defenses sur
rounding Port Arthur, -eras taken by
lhÂ» Japanese on July 6.
Continuing the Chinaman declares
that Russians in Port Arthur say that
Isst week three regiments of 'Japan
ese troops were wiped out just north
of Port Arthur. A Russian regiment
â¢which was out recevnnoitering: was
Criven back tof the three Japanese
reciments. who were in turn surround
ed by two regiments of Cossacks and
Â¦wip^d out.
CHEFU, July 7. 5: JO p. m. â A
trustworthy Chinese who arrived here
to-day from a point on the east coast
of Kwangtung Peninsula, near Port
Arthur, brings the information that
on July 5 one division of the Japanese
army reached the northeast slope of
Takushan Mountain, the summit of
vhich is less than three miles from
Port Arthur. This division parted
from another division of the army on
the highway north of Port Arthur.
after which it made its way through
mountainous country. The other di
vision contiued along the main road
toward the marine camp, to reach
which it will have to pass over a
plain; but attacked by this division
In conjunction with that on Takushan
Mountain, the marine camp â¢will not
be tenable.

JAPANESE GUNBOAT
KAIMON STRIKES A
MINE AND IS LOST
TOKIO, July 7 (7
p. m.). â While engag
ing in special work off
Taliemvan Bay on July 5
during a dense fog, the
Japanese gunboat Kaimon
struck a Russian mine and
sank almost immediately.
Commander Takahashi
ordered the crew to enter the
boats and leave the ship, but
refused to leave himself, and
it is presumed that he re
mained on the bridge and
went down. A majority of
the crew escaped in boats.
Besides Commander Taka
hashi, two officers and nine
teen men are missing.
The Kaimon was of wood
and was launched in Japan
in 1882. She had a comple
ment of 230 men. Her length
was 210 feet, beam 32 feet
and mean draught 16 feet 5
inches. She had a displace
ment of 1490 tons, and her
speed was 12 knots. She was
rated as a cruiser until 1896,
when she was relegated to
the gunboat class.

Zelich made the following statement
regarding his coming into possession
of the will and his acquaintance with
the testator:
-For several years before old Magin Caitro
died I owned a restaurant on Seventh street
and the old man- used to board with me. I
knew that he was poor and had . to : depend
on breaking colts - and horses for a living
ard so I never asked him for money. When
he had money he paid me and when he had
none he was always welcome to a meal and
a Klass of i wine/ â¢ ' Â¦ '
One . night, some time before the old man
died. â¢ he came to my place and gave me the
will. - telling me that' he had made m e his
heir.' â¢ I -didn't pay much attention ' to it, 'for
I knew the old man was poor and I thought
he -just wanted to show that he remembered
my kindness,' so ' I put the ' paper away and
did not think of it again until the old man
died. Then I took the will" to Attorney
Batchelder and told him to see about it. The
matter Is In his hands now. and he: has told
me that Castro owned a lot of property when
he died, but how much. we don't know yet.
I have left everything to my attorney,*^ for I
have a i family to support Â¦ and I can't afford
to lie idle .while I am waiting for. this prop
erty, which -1 may never get, although I think
everything wlU eume out all right* '
ZELICH EXPLAINS.
As soon as Attorney Batchelder dis
covered that the will of Juan Jose
Castro had never been probated he lost
no time in making application for the
appointment of an administrator on the
estate, and yesterday George Manetera,
the proprietor of the Athens candy
store In this city, was appointed. Man
etera at once filed a bond in the sum
of $500, on which the names of Nicholas
Symacapulos and J. Simon appear as
sureties, and yesterday I afternoon the
bond was approved 6y Judge Greene.
The bond was sent to Martinez to-day
to be filed.
The estate for which Zelich has be
gun his legal fight is a part of the old
Spanish grant to the Castro family,
and dates back to the early history of
California.. Through the division of the
estate among the descendants of the
original Castro family the grant was
cut up and gradually decreased in
size, until when the gradfather of Ma
gin Castro died only about thirty-six
thousand acres of the original grant in
Contra Costa .County remained. This
property was inherited by Don Juan
Jose Castro and his brother, each of
whom had six children. At the time
of his death Don Juan Jose Castro
owned about eighteen thousand acres
in Contra Costa. County, six thousand
acres in Santa Clara County and one
thousand acres in Old Mexico. By the
terms of his will each of his six chil
dren was to receive an equal share
of the estate, but this will was never
probated, and so far as is known -all
the children of Juan j Jose Castro died
childless, so that the entire estate re
verted to Magin Castro, whp survived
the other five children, and at his death,
by the terms of the will, the land'be
came the property of Gregorio Zelich,;
who is now taking steps to establish
his title tothe property. / â¢
ADMINISTRATOR APPOINTED.
Zelich regarded the will as of little
value, as he knew that the old Span
iard, who, during the later years of his
life, earned his living by .' breaking
horses, died in apparent poverty. He
placed the will in the hands of Attor
ney Batchelder, however, instructing
him to file it for probate, and in the
investigation which ensued it was dis
covered that the will of Don Juan Jose
Castro, the father of the testator," which
had been filed in Contra Costa County
nearly fifty years ago, had never been
probated.
The establishment of this fact clouds
the present title of every piece of
property which was formerly a part of
the estate of Don Juan Jose Castro, and
if the contention of Zelich is sustained
by the courts he will by the terms of
the will of Magin Castro be the heir
to the entire estate, which includes
in all nearly twenty-three thousand
acres of land.
OAKLAND,. July 7. â Nearly twenty
three thousandacres of rich farm land
located near Sobrante in Contra Costa
County and one thousand acres in Old
Mexico, all of which were formerly a
part of the old Castro estate, are the
prizes for which Gregorio Zelich,; a
cook in a restaurant at Seventh and
Market streets, has inaugurated what
may prove to be one of the most bitter
legal battles in the history. of the Cal
ifornia courts.
The first step in the figljt was taken
some months ago, when Attorney T..F.--
Batchelder, representing Zelich, tiled
for probate in the courts of Alameda,
Contra Costa and Santa Clara counties
the will of Don Magin Castro, the son.
of Don Juan Jose Castro. By the terms?
of the will Gregorio Zelich- was'
named .as the beneficiary of Magin
Castro in consideration of his kind
ness to the deceased during his life
time.

Reap Heavily for a
Kind Act.

* RESULTS IN MURDER
Horton was 38 years of age and was
a native of Howard Lake, Minn. He
leaves a wife, one son and a brother,
Charles Horton. Before coming to
Oakland Horton resided for some time
in Haywards, where he owned consid
erable property. He was a member of
the Masonic lodge of Haywards, the
Odd Fellows and the Workmen.
Attempts were made to revive Hor
ton, but as he showed no signs of life
Dr. W. J. Wilcox was called. When
he arrived the victim of the deadly
fluid was past medical aid. The Cor
oner was notified.
The bell of the telephone was ring
ing continuously. In order to stop
the 'noise Horton determined to cut
the wires outside the house. He dis
connected the wire af'a fuse block
and when the circuit was broken Hor
ton, who was standing on the damp
ground, received the entire force of
the high, voltage of current through
his body. The shock was instantly
fatal. The only witness of the acci
dent was Horton's nine-year-old son,
Charles. The boy, when he saw his
father fall to the ground, ran into the
house screaming for his mother. Mrs.
Horton came out to see what was
wrong and when she saw her hus
band lying on the ground she realized
what was the matter, as her husband
had said he was going to cut the tele
phone wires. D. W. La Fortune and a
man named Dixon heard the cries of
the son and they were the first to ar
rive on the scene. ,
Horace A. Horton, a steamfitter
employed in San Francisco, was elec
trocuted this evening at 8 o'clock at
his home, 1220 Thirteenth avenue,
while attempting to disconnect a tele
phone wire leading to the Horton
house that had become crossed with
an arc light circuit carrying 5000
volts.

A. W. Berry, a money lender at 1165
Washington street, was arrested to
night at his residence, 1420 Webster
street, on a charge of embezzling $2000
from Amos Seaman, a capitalist, living
at 1561 Chestnut street. Constables
Hempstead and Lane, who arrested
Berry, were compelled to force their
way Into the house against the effort
of Berry's sister, Miss Mabel Berry, to
prevent the officers from entering.
The accused man's mother, Mrs. Han
nah Berry, was highly excited by the
officers* Dresence " and declared they
must kill her before they could take
her son. Berry and the constables
quieted the woman and went to the
County Jail..
The accused man sent for Mayor Ol
ney, who in turn procured Attorney C.
L. Colvin to' take charge of Berry's
case. Berry was released on a bond of
$2000, the sureties being his mother and
his sister. The bond was approved by
Judge George Samuels.
Seaman alleges that he gave Berry
money at various times aggregating
$2000, the return of which he has de
manded in vain. Berry insists that the
coin was advanced to him for the. pur
pose of handling in his business as a
broker and money render and that he
has kept up his Interest payments. He
claims that Seaman is trying to use the
criminal courts as a collection agency.

Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1016 Broadway, July 7.
For alleged complicity in the beating
of State Policeman J. R. Lewis of the
railway police service Fourth of July
night at the Oakland mole, Harry
Laughran, a San Francisco teamster,
has been arrested and is now in the
County Jail here, and a number of
more arrests are 1 to follow. According
to Chief of the Service C. C. Crowley,
the beating of Lewis is the result of
the old teamsters' strike in San Fran
cisco, during which Lewis acted as a
special and gained the enmity of the
leamsters' Union.
A large number of teamsters were at
Shell Mound Park on the Fourth of
July attending the Thistle Club picnic.
Going home on the last boat a. number
of them attacked several pt the Stat*
policemen. Two drew their revolver?
and made their escane. Lewis, how
ever, was unable to get away and was
kicked and beaten and left for dead.
Crowley stated this morning that they
were teamsters who made the attack
and that he has proof sufficient to war
rant the arrest of a number of" them.
He states that Lewis is recovering
from his injuries, which were not seri
ous. He charged Laughran with an as
sault to murder. .
A man named Charles Murphy, who
is also charged with taking part in the
assault on Lewis, was arrested yester
day afternoon in San Francisco by
State Policeman Butler and Detective
Tom Ryan. He .will be brought to
Oakland to-morrow morning.
Laughran was released to-night oh
$1000 bond.

1016 Broadway, July 7.
The mangled body of Charles O'Con
nor, a section hand employed by the
Southern Pacific- Company, was found
this morning on the Stanford-avenue
tracks, near the station at Golden
Ciate. Train hands on the tiret Berke
ley local train found the body and re
ported to the Coroner. James O'Con
cor and Dennis O'Connor, brother? of
the dead man, fear he met with foul
piay.
According to their statements to the
Coroner, v'harles O'Connor drew 560
yesterday from the company. He was
seen in a number of saloons at Golden
Gate during the afternoon, and was
di inking. Only $1 03 was found in the
iK.thing on the fcody. This gave rise to
the suspicion that O'Connor might
have*been drugged and robbed, his
body being placed on the tracks to
cover evidences of crime. Another the
ory is that O'Connor became befud
dled from liquor and was struck by an
en&ine while crossing the tracks to go
to his home at 5787 San Pablo avenue.
He was unmarried and was SO years
old.
The police and Coroner Mehrmann

Ladrina Medeiros Sus
tains Frightful Injuries
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1016 Broadway, July 7.
Ladrina Medeiros, a girl S years old,
was fatally burned here this afternoon
while trying to start a fire with kero
sene oil, at her parents' home, 616
Franklin street. The can exploded in
her hands and set fire to her clothing
and two-thirds of her entire body was
denuded of its skin. The child's moth
er, Mrs. Mary Medeiros, crippled with
rheumatism, had to sit and watch her
child's frantic efforts to put out the
llame without being able ,to give her
any assistance.
The little yirl died at the Receiving'
Hospital at 7:10 this evening, and the
body was taken to the Morgue.
Owing to the crippled condition* of
the mother the child was told to light
the fire in the stove. She had placed
some wood in the stove and was pour
ins coal oil on it when the can explod
ed. It was found afterward with the
bottom out The blazing oil set fire to
the child and the mother tried to res
cue her with a crutch, but was unable
to be of any assistance. She is now
nearly insane with her grief. The
frenzied child ran to a tub of water
and tried to get into it, but there was
not sufficient water in the vessel to
cover her.
Screaming she then ran out into the
back yard, where she was seen by
Louis Felipe, who climbed over a fence
and went to her assistance. When she
saw him she ran and put her arms
about his neck and set fire to his hair
and clothing, which he managed to ex
tinguish, but not before his hair was
burned off at the back. Then securing
a blanket he enveloped the child in it
and put out the flames.
The suffering child was taken to the
Receiving Hospital, where she was at
tended by Dr. Kane, who held out no
hope for her recovery.

Both Russians and Japanese are appealing to that

Another American army officer has killed himself, and
behind the tragedy of his self-destruction is the shadow
of a woman. These bloody affairs are becoming of so
frequent occurrence that certainly it is time for Uncle

to be far more dangerous to our heroes than the arts
of our valiant foes:

United States army (United Stated

TWO cities on the Pacific Coast are expecting the
immediate use of the convertible strength born of
mountain torrents. * Ten thousand horsepower will
soon be carried by cables 125 miles long from the Kern
River into the city of Los Angeles. A great plant will
take into Seattle, from Cedar Lake, electrical energy
that can eventually be developed to the maximum force
of 50,000 horses. In the Pacific Coast mountains are
torrential streams, fed by melting snows and vast water
sheds, endowed with sufficient potentiality to revolution
ize the industries of the entire slope and to create new
sources of wealth. Countless small mountain rivulets
become creeks, then lakes and rivers in which stored-up
possibilities invite enterprise- and' offer advantages sup
plemental to the great ones of climate and soil.
Less than a quarter' of a century ago the men at the
head of transcontinental railways looked upon the
States of the Pacific Coast as areas that must perforce be
considered principally agricultural or for a time mineral,
until the deposits in the mines were all extracted. They
were supposed to be a sure field to afford tolls for all
time for the long haul across the continent of the goods,
and wares manufactured in the East. . Eastern manu
facturers took the same view of this seaward slope.
One of the daring conceptions of which the* historian
of this industrial nation must take account was that en
tertained by freight traffic managers of railways east and
west, that it would be possible to minimize sea competi
tion in the carrying trade by so shaping freight tariffs
that Chicago and its vicinity should be built up as manu
facturing cities as against large communities already ex
tensively manufacturing on the seaboard of the Atlantic.
Much was done to accomplish this romantic dream of
hard-headed millionaires back of railway management
and the temporary results have certainly been large and
profitable to the Middle West.
No one, seemingly, took into consideration the water
power of the Pacific Coast mountains. Sea carriers of
freight were much smaller than they are. They burned
expensive fuel; were hampered in their use of the sea by
restrictive agreements that tied up traffic by way of the
Isthmus of Panama and handed its control over to rail
ways that were thousands of miles distant from the
isthmus, but dominated its transportation by subsidy
contracts.
Every day during this period the Pacific Coast moun
tain streams, unharnessed, were wasting their strength
in destroying levees in the springtime or idly flowing to
the sea during the remainder of the year. The day of
their supremacy has since been slowly but surely dawn
ing. Great electric power plants, based on the flow ot
There are some people, no doubt,
who fancy that Â£32.000 an ounce Is
quite enough to give for anything in
the world, and yet from all appear
ances there is little doubt that this
price will come to be looked upon as
a very modest one for radium. Th?
action of the Austrian Government in
restricting the mininjj of pitchblende
in Bohemia is already having its ef
fect and the mighty atoms become
more valu^le every day. As an In
stance of the manner in which the
precious material is regarded, we need
only mention the demand that is made
for the mere loan of a specimen of
radium. It is of 1,800,000 activity,
and has a distinct effect on the elec
troscope at a distance of eight feet.
For the few specks of yellowish sub
stance in the center of a case half the
size of a lady's watch over Â£100 has
been refused, the owners preferring to
lend it out to doctors at Â£5 a time.

These landsmen are playing the same game that was
played for years by the Algerine pirates who levied
blackmail upon Mediterranean commerce and took white
Europeans off ships and sold them into slavery. Every
nation in Europe submitted to this, and the more money
they paid the pirates in ransoms and for freedom of the
sea the more was charged. Finally the United States
took up the matter and ended Algerine piracy and paved
the way for the French conquest, which has resulted in
making that part of Africa peaceable and safe. We have
no desire now to interfere beyond the limit of the Perdi
caris case. That supplied a vigorous phrase in the his
tory of American diplomacy when Secretary Hay de
manded of the Sultan: "The American alive or Raissouli
dead." That unkeys the situation for Great Britain.
Under our form of government an act of war must be
authorized by Congress. But the British Government is
executive and can 'act with promptness. It can not only
demand a robber dead but can make him dead in default
of action by another.
The safety of the nationals of every Government on
earth is the first requirement of international justice and
it should be secured at all hazards. The North African
plan of putting the Sultan of Morocco in a hole by cap
turing foreigners and holding them as hostages or- for a
ransom will not run much further without running
against a large surprise. \
THE success of the Moorish bandit Raissouli in get
ting ransom money and extension of his power for
an American and an Englishman has fired the
chiefs of the Anghera tribe, who threaten to capture an
other Englishman and hold him as a hostage until cer
tain of their tribesmen who are in jail for various crimes
are released. It is to be hoped they will do this and that
they will make the same demand that Raissouli made, for
ransom and for territory and privileges to be granted by
the Sultan and guaranteed by Great Britain. Such a de
mand should be acceded to until the captive is released
and then Great Britain should land a forcÂ« sufficient to
wipe the whole gang off the face of the earth.
THE MOOR RAMPANT.
Independence day has passed, the smoke of celebra
tion has cleared, patriotism has found full and boister
ous expression and the small boy, somewhat the worse
for the wear and tear of the day, perhaps, i$ still with
us. Having shown that on July 4 we are all loving
members of a glorious national family, we will now pro
ceed to exploit our various unworth in the great national
political campaign which closes in November. After a
little bluster, some buncombe will do no harm.
Kuropatkin, it is announced, will be ready, after the
rainy season, just beginning, has ended, to take the of
fensive against his doughty Japanese foes. This procla
mation seems almost incredible to those of us that have
followed even casually the warlike events in the Far
East. For a soldier.with a reputation Kuropatkin is the
most inoffensive, peace-loving, retiring gentleman now
in the world's eye. It would be a violation of the pro
prieties which he has created to make him fight.

"That reminds me of an incident that
occurred gome years ago In one of the

a law in that county providing for th.Â»

Children Still:
"To the Yellow God, the Black God,
the White God and the Green God:
Please kindly take us all up with you
and do not leave us unprotected, but
destroy our enemies." Such a prayer
is to be found on a Tibetan praying
wheel, said A. R. Wright at a meeting
otrihe Folklore Society held in Albe
marle street W. A novel feature of
this prayer wheel whlcn the Tibetan
spends much of the time In turning
is that if turned the wrong way every
thing done before is undone.
Some of the articles used by the Ti
betans in their devotions are very
grewsome. A human thigh bone cov
ered with human skin is used as a
horn for exorcising demons and to
draw the soul from hell. A double
drum made from two halves of a
skull, the skin covering being that of
a human being, is placed on the altar
of certain deities in the Tibetan re
ligion. â London Mail.

which epeaks to the woman of "our
child." Needless to say, it was not
written by the shipowner's son. Thus
upon the proud old man bursts? the
knowledge that one of his grandchil
dren is Illegitimate. The question is,
which one? Burnside believes that he
can drag the truth out of the mother,
but she declines to tell. And the rest
of the play shows the old man crushed
by the knowledge that has come to him
and harassed by doubts as to vrhat
course he must take. It Is all tragic
enough, but the author brings about a
happy ending by making the old ship
per decide to take both children to his
heart again and to carry out his first
intention regarding them.
If '"Warp and Woof," the new play
by the Hon. Mrs. Alfred Lyttelton, pre
sents a true picture, as it purports to
do, of the state of affairs existing In
fashionable London dressmaking estab
lishments, then It constitutes an In
dictment of the Government of which
her husband, the Colonial Secretary, Is
a shining member, for failure to enforce
the factory acts. One might para
phrase Hood and call it a dramatic
"Sor.ff of the Skirt." We are intro
duced to the sweat shop, 'not In* 1 the
purlieus of poverty stricken White
ehapel, but in the luxurious West End.
We are shown wretched, pallid, 111-fed
women being worked early and late In
defiance of the law to complete in time
for some fashionable function the cos
tumes ordered by society women who
are utterly Indifferent to the welfare of
the toileri! who minister to their pleas
ure. Their shallowness, vulgarity a'nd
selfishness are strikingly depicted. The
most dramatic scene in the play is that
in which Theodosia (Mrs. Patrick
Campbell) enters the drawing-room of
Lady Jenny Barkenstone with the
gown which the latter is awaiting.
While making It Theodosia's sister had
fainted. In the presence of her guests,
Lady Jenny, irritated by the delay in
the garment's arrival, treats Theodosia
to a torrent of abuse. It is then that
the shop girl, driven desperate by the
sufferings she has witnessed and the
unjust attack upon herself, lets fly at
her ladyship and the assembled com
pany and tells them some wholesome
truths from the working woman's
point of view. Some critics assert that
Mrs. Lyttelton's picture of the condi
tions prevailing in West End dress
making establishments is grossly over
drawn. Dressmakers and factory in
spectors have been interviewed and of
course they declare that the ills which
Mrs. Lyttelton has portrayed exist only
in her imagination.
LONDON, June 22.â At the present
writing arrangements are practically
complete for a lengthy -frsur in the
United States on the part of Edward
Terry, the English actor-manager.
He will be seen in America about the
end of the year in "The House of Burn
side," which he is now giving at his
own theater in London and which, If
it is not a workmanlike play, is at all
events an interesting one and shows
the actor at his best.
Few actors on this side of the water
are better known than Edward Terry,
though this will be his first visit to the
United States. He Is famous as one of
that merry band who disported them
selves at the Old Gaiety when the "Sa
cred Lamp of Burlesque" was burning
most brightly, and of whom Henry Irv
ing, Nellie Farren and Toole were also
members, but perhaps he is best known
on account of his connection with
"Sweet Lavender." The Pinero comedy
was one of Terry's first ventures at the
theater which he opened in the Strand
in 1SS7. It was his great card â he played
Dick Phenyl. the hero, 670 times in Lon
don, and goodness only knows how
many in the provinces and colonies.
Since he was obliged to shelve "Sweet
Lavender" Terry has been looking for
another such play, without much luck
until now.' His last appearance in Lon
don, when he used a piece by Captain
Basil Hood, was a dire failure. But it
really looks as if the actor had a good
thing in "The House of Burnside." It is
one more adaptation from the French
by the indefatigable Louis ,N. Parker,
and well enough done for all practical
purposes. The original was called "La
Maison." Jhe story is simple. Richard
Burnside, the gruff but really tender
hearted old hero, Is exactly the sort of
character which Terry is happiest in
representing. He is head of the great
shipping house of Burnside, but great
as is his pride in the business, It has to
take second place to his love for his two
little grandchildren. Burnslde's son,
Dick, has proved a ne'er do weel, and
after his death his wife, Marion, and
her two children have come to live with
Richard Burnside. The shipowner has
planned that the boy. little Dick, shall
succeed to the business. On the little
girl. Maggie, he intends to settle half
his fortune.
Then tragedy comes in at the door.
A letter arrives for the young widow
which falls into Burnside's hands and
Terry Will Tour America.
THE world is getting information that it has lacked
about the quality of the Japanese. The little em
pire is strained to ultimate tension by the war with
Russia. The genius of its leaders-and the courage of its
people are on trial and they stand the test. The lamen
tations are not for th'e dead, but that those who are left
at home were not privileged to perish in their place.
Mothers" hear that their sons died in battle and exult
that they bore them to die for their country. Fathers
mourn not that their children have fallen under arras,
but that their age keeps them inactive at home. On
lookers call it fatalism and name it an Oriental trait, an
Asiatic peculiarity. But it has in it as pure and high
minded patriotism as burns in the breasts of the heroes
of the whitest nations.
Americans who had contact with our red Indians in
their primitive nobility see at once the existence of the
Japanese quality. It is not stolidity nor indifference, but
is a manifestation of the sense of duty to country, to tribe,
to others, in its highest form. The physical likeness of
the American Indian to the Eastern Asiatic is supple
mented by this psychological likeness, which is revealed
under the pressure of war. Ethnologists will not fail to
observe and investigate it. It is not a fact that the Ja
panese feel no grief for their dead heroes. It is in the
heart, but unexpressed. It is under the kindly cover of
a philosophy and patriotism the most admirable and a
patience that is not jarred by any personal sorrow. The
people pause to render the rites for the dead and then
set their faces to the further responsibilities of the strug

The coming centenary of George
Fand has brought out the fact â which
probably will surprise most personsâ
that some of the authoress* work still
remains unpublished. These writings,
which now are likely to see. the light of
day. include two plays named "The
Man With the Marionettes." and
"Manon," and | several fragments of
novels. Of these the most interesting
is "Memoirs of J. Paille," which, be
gun by George Sand in 1863, was in
tended by the authoress to be the life
story of an Imaginary grandson of
Rousseau. It was given up, however,
when Madame Sand discovered that
the same idea had been used by Claude
Genoux in "Lea Enfants de Rousseau."
Among the other fragments Is "The
Queen of the Snows," which its au
thoress seems to - have intended much
on the lines of Dickens' "Christmas
Books."
Dr. Emil Reich, whose book. "Suc
cess Among Nations," seems to have
aroused a good deal of controversy in
the United Statesâ Just as it has over
np re â is a smooth-faced, handsome,
middle-aged Hungarian savant who
haÂ» the^ sift of speech to an almost
miraculous degree. He has been giv
ing a course of university lectures in
London this season on a wide range of
tcpics, packed with all sorts of difficult
facts, and yet with never so much as
a cuff-note to look Rt. His eloquence
is of the persuasive sort that some
how enables him to tell an audience
lcrgely composed of English women
that as a rule he thinks English women
a tame lot, not at all comparable with
thejr sisters in France, for Instance.
There Is something about his fiery en
thusiasm that takes the sting out of
the words. He dearly loves to be on
the other side of an argument, and I
suspect that Is one reason for his con
troversial attitude regarding American
women. He chuckled Joyously the
other day in the writer's presence when
an American visitor hurled at him the
following comment: "You may have
lived ic America five years. Dr. Reich,
but you evidently saw only one kind of
American womanâ the kind that rushed
up to you after a lecture and car
ried you off triumphantly to dinner for
tbe sake of getting a bit of prestige.
You got among culture-grabbers and
hand-Fhakers and stayed among 'em
the whole five yearn, and never knew
there was another sort of American
woman. You made a hasty generaliza
tion, in other words." The learned
doctor's answer to this gallant on
slaught was crushing. "My boy." said
he, "come and have a drink." The
doctor's wife is a charming little
French lady, and their London home
is hospitable, indeed.
Possibly the first part of the fore
poing may be true â though one hopes
it isn't. Regarding the point at issue,
the present writer's experience has led
him tn believe that an American work
of real quality â whether serious or
fictionâ will be recognized as such by
ninety-nine out of a hundrtd British
reviewers. But when an American
booK is badâ well, then I think there is
tendency on the part of most literary
critics to make rather a point of its
trans-Atlantic origin.
HEADQUARTERS OF THE CALL,
E tiEXRIETTA STREET, COVENT
GARDEN. LONDON, June 22.â"Eng
lish Bards and Scotch Reviewers" was
the title, it will be remembered, of By
ron's savage onslaught upon the Edin
burgh Review, and that of "American
Cooks and English Reviewers" might be
applied to the discussion that has been
raging of late in a prominent London
newspaper regarding works from the
United States and their standing In
this country. Probably echoes of this
argument have not failed to reach the
other side of the Atlantic. It started In
the Chronicleâ which is known as the
most literary of the London dailiesâ
tnd arose out of a book review which
appeared recently in the columns of
that newspaper. The volume reviewed,
which had as its subject "Matthew-
Arnold." was published by G. P. Put
nam's Sons, and perhaps this was why
the reviewer, who roasted the work.
Cot the impression that its origin was
American, and gave this impression in
what he wrote about it. Instantly
came a. letter from George H. Putnam,
who is now in this country, pointing
out that the volume's author was not
an American at all, but English, and
deprecating .what the publisher de
scribed as a prejudice against American
books on the part of the British re
viewers. The resultant discussion has
l>een as to whether such a prejudice
Â« xist*. and opinions have been ex
pressed by authors, reviewers and pub
lishers â among them John Lane,
Â¦Rita." Mrs. Dudenay and, lastly,
Arthur Waugh, who wrote the offend
ing review. It was asserted by one
witness that the books by American
professors that find their way over
here almost invariably compare so un
favorably with the works of British
tavants that no English reviewer can
be blamed for feeling some misgiving
on encountering a supposedly "pro
found" volume from the other side, but
even this writer denied indignantly
that a book of any kind would be
'"roasted" hrre, regardless of its merit,
fimply because it was American.

The sad financial experience of several wealthy women
.who tried to evade the payment of heavy customs duties

goods. If the deft fingers of foreigners can weave better
than our own, then those that think so must pay for
their opinion.
THE Democratic press has shrieked itself into ex
haustion in sustaining Mr. John Sharp Williams in
his attack on the President in the matter of his
views on the Monroe hemisphere. . Mr. Cleveland inter
preted the Monroe doctrine once in a way satisfactory to
the country and declared that' our honor required that
we defend it by war if necessary. That was on the ques
tion of arbitrating the boundary dispute between* Great
Britain and Venezuela. â¢
It was hoped in this country that the demonstration
then made would improve the quality of government in
Venezuela. We declared it to be our policy and inten
tion to defend her sovereignty and territory against the
strongest power in the world, and immediately gratitude
toward us became epidemic at Caracas. A monument to
Monroe was planned and "El tio Samuel" was toasted
from the Andes to the sea. But the lesson was lost upon
that Government. Instead of acquiring respect for the
international rights of others Venezuela, became more
lawless than ever and included nationals' of the United
States among those she plundered and outraged. She is
a nefarious example of that indecency of government
that President Roosevelt deprecated and by so doing
brought upon him Democratic wrath.
Now comes Hayti, remembering that Mr. Cleveland
threatened to fight Great Britain for Venezuela, and look
ing to this country to defend her . against France and
Germany, whose Ministers have been stoned in the
streets by the bodyguard of the President who has suc
ceeded Simon Sam. This offense *was not committed by
the rabble of 'the street, but by the official guard of the
President under command of officers who, if they did not
participate in the outrage, did nothing to prevent it.
A nation is insulted in the person of its Minister. A
blow aimed at him is aimed at the nation he represents
and is a matter that cannot be ignored. France and
Germany are sending each a war ship to Hayti to de
mand reparation and that country tries now to run to
cover under the wing of the American eagle and wishes
our protection against punishment for her indecency.
But she knocks at the wrong d<jor. France and Ger
many have our permission under the Monroe doctrine to
land troops and thrash Hayti soundly. They may even
impose upon her a money indemnity to pay the cost of
whipping her into decency and must stop only at her
sovereignty and her territorial integrity.
We are of the opinion that it would be a wholesome
lesson, useful to all mongrel Latin-America, to let Hayti
be soundly punished by the two nations she has in
sulted. It would do her good and would improve 'her
Government and elevate the ideas of her people. It
would als^> save the United States the expense of admin
istering discipline to the Haytians and others, for
nothing is more certain than that this country will have'
to interfere in certain parts of Latin-America and by
force of arms compel order. Both parties set the exam
ple and established the precedent by intervening in
Cuba. The reason was found in that island being near
us, in the Monroe^hetntsiphere, and its condition of
chronic revolution disturbed our commerce, made diffi
cult the observance of our neutral obligations and hurt
cur feelings. , ;/â
This all applies to all Latin-America, and if indecent
government, defiance of international obligations and re
fusal to pay debts while the public revenues are being
stolen by robbers like Castro continue we will have to
enforce order there as we did in Cuba. If France arid
Germany will do it for us in Hayti it will save us trouble
and expense.

Mark Twain has shown that no one

example.. Of late, the humorist has
been pitching into the vivisectionists
in a really savage way. It may be re
membered, too, that when Jerome was
editing "Tq,-day," he went for the Sul
tan of Turkey so viciously that the
Foreign Office had to warn him to soft
en his tone. And the author of "Three

Presently they saw a fine fat bird of

CALL BUREAU, PRESS BUILD
IXG, WORLD'S FAIR, ST. LOUIS,
July 7.â Figures of animals done with
horticultural trimmings seem to be
very good material for advertising a
State's resources. California is strong
on this sort of work. Santa Clara
County set the fashion some years ago
by building a prune knight that looked
like the real product of a mediaeval
family tree. Its exhibition did not dou
ble the population of the county, but it
caused nearly everybody who saw it to
remember Santa Clara and alscr
the fact that fine prunes were pro
duced there. At the present World's
Fair the idea has been used quite ex
tensively. Los Angeles has built up an
elephant of walnuts and the Sacramen
to Valley exhibits a grizzly bear of
prunes and a horse with a hide of hops.
Sacramento's grizzly has, besides some
flies, a curious throng of people around
it all day. It stands at the main en
trance to the Sacramento Valley Devel
opment Association's display in the
Palace of Agriculture, and as Sacra
mento's space has a frontage directly
on one of the main aisles of the build
ing, few visitors pass without inspect
ing it. Children drag their parents
clear across the fair grounds in a
search for the bear with the glowing
electric eyes. Tbe little ones are quite
a factor in drawing adults to certain
exhibits where something; is shown that
pleases the Juveniles, ana wise exhibit
ors are aware of this. The children
pass the intelligence of something
novel to them among each other by a
sort of endless chain method. This
helps bring the prune-covered planti
grade that, were it alive, would soon
devour its own sweet covering, the at
tention desired. v
The Sacramento Valley display Is
pronounced one of the richest and
most diversified at the fair, as well
as one of the most imposing, the imi
tation dome of the State Capitol pierc
ing the rafters of the Agricultural
building. Visitors can spend a long
time in the exhibit and most of them
do. Sacramento is a great producer
of prunes, as well as Santa Clara, and
this fruit is shown prominently. The
display of olives and olive oil is very
extensive, the culture of the olive
having become a very prominent in
dustry in the valley.
The Development Association has a
number of people connected with the
exhibit to receive visitors and tell
them of the fertility- of the section
represented. There are now three of
the commissioners of the association
here. Colonel R. M. Green of Oroville.
Judge J. H. Wills of Auburn and John
Reith Jr. of Woodland. Besides these
there are Roy Brooke of Sacramento,
J. A. Simons of Colusa, Mrs. R. A.
Bailey of Sacramento, Mrs. R. Ken
nedy of Butte and W. D. Nlcholls of
Sacramento, who processes the fruit
exhibited. . These all work for the
interest of the entire valley and no
section is neglected. Mrs. Bailey has
contributed an exhibit of Sacramento
Valley fruits put up at her home,
which demonstrates the value of the
fruits for preserving. This exhibition
greatly attracts women visitors.
A preserved salmon weighing forty
pounds, a striped bass weighing fif
teen pounds and other fish from the
Sacramento River are shown in a
tank.

his ankle was a strap which was
fastened to a chain by a lock. The boy
stated that he had been chained there at
11 o'clock this morning. The officer
waited until nearly 5 o'clock before the
boy's stepmother returned, and then
she appeared to be in no hurry to re
lease the little fellow.

Win Attention at the Fair
Mrs. Clark is the daughter ofSMrs.
Lucy Caldwell, whose husband was a
member of one of the old families of
Virginia.
The fair bride wore a nuptial robe of
liberty satin and duchesse lace, with
a tulle veil falling about her. She was
attended by the Misses Helen and
Lanette Hough of Stockton, cousins of
the bride, who were smartly gowned in
pale blue frocks, in compliment to the
arm of the service to which the gallant
groom is attached. The groom was at
tended by Lieutenant Frank R. Curtis,
U. S. A.
Yesterday a very pretty military
wedding occurred when Miss Mary
Lucille Caldwell and Lieutenant Pey
ton G. Clark, U. S. A., were united by
the Rev. Jerome Hannigan of St.
Mary's Cathedral.
The affair was quietly celebrated at
the home of the bride's aunt and uncle,
Mr. and Mrs. Frank Caldwell Zimmer
man, in the presence of relatives and a
few close friends.
Distinctly the most Interesting en
gagement of the summer months is
that proclaimed yesterday when Mrs.
M. A. Tobin announced the betrothal
of her versatile daughter. Miss Celia.
to Charles W. Clark of San Mateo.
The gossips have long noted the de
votion of the wealthy young widower
to the clever Miss Cella, whose charm
before now has held the attention of
many men. . But this affair was dif
ferent, the dashing young woman re
ciprocated and herewith are congrat
ulations in order to the captor.
Mr. Clark is a clever chap, a Yale
man, and from his peregrinations over
the earth has acquired much world
culture. His San Mateo home, pur
chased from the Walter Hobarts. is
one of the show places of that suburb.
And over this menage Miss Tobin will
preside in fitting fashion. A musician,
a linguist and in sympathy with art
and literature, the fair fiancee is
splendidly equipped to take her posi
tion as one of the richest matrons of
the West.
In accomplishments of the open, she
is an adept at golf, plays a fair game
of tennis, and in all Burlingame there's
no rider in oftener at the death. As
to the date for the wedding, nothing
definite is given out.

I Miss Nellie Holmes, treasurer*
of the Young Woman's Temper-
ance Association of Buffalo, N.Y.,
strongly advises all suffering
women to rely, as she (fid, up-
on Lydia E, Pinkham's Vege-
table Compound.
" Dear Mrs. Pikkham : â Your med-
icine is indeed an ideal woman's medi-
cine, and by far the best I know to
restore lost health and strength. I
sneered misery for several years, being
troubled with menorrhagia. My back
ached, I had bearing-down pains and
frequent headaches. I would often
wake from restful sleep, and in such
pain that I suffered for hours before I
could go to sleep again. I dreaded the
long nights as much as the weary days.
I consulted two different physicians,
hoping to get relief, but, finding that
their medicine did not seem to cure me.
I tried your "Vegetable Compound
on the recommendation of a friend
from the East who was visiting me.
" I am glad that I followed her ad-
vice, for every ache and pain is gone,
and not only this, but my general
health is much improved. I have a
fine appetite and have gained in flesh.
My earnest advice to suffering women
is to put aside all other medicines and
to take jLydia E. Pinkham*s Vege-
table Compound." â Miss Nellik

a defective beam for balance The
beam gave way and fell. He fell with
it and struck the grappling irons con
nected .with a derrick. Thereby he
sustained two broken ribs and two
fractured bones in the face, perma

PITCHER CHESBRO LOSES
AFTER FOURTEEN VICTORIES
NEW ORLEANS, July 7. â Two bills
adopted at the present session of the
Louisiana Legislature suppressing
poolrooms throughou the State have
been signed by Governor Blanchard.
After* the 1st of, September every pool
room will have to close. There are
eight of these establishments in New
Orleans and one in every town of the
State. Their owners have abandoned
opposition and the only stand expect
ed will probably be taken by an own
er here, who says he will test the new
law's constitutionality on ground that
the measure was not properly adver
tised before its final pasage. The anti
pool-room bills were agitated and
adopted with such rapidity that the
poolroom operators did not have time
to organize an opposition movement
sufficiently strong to defeat the law.
Governor Blanchard Has Signed Two
Bills and the Rooms Must Close .
On September 1.
POOLROOMS ARE SUPPRESSED
\ BY LOUISIANA LEGISLATURE
Sparks from the chimney of a ba
kery at 42 Grove street, which dropped
into the room through a skylight of
an Invalid woman named Margaret
Conliss. who was lying in bed, set the
bedclothes on fire. The smell from
the burning material attracted the at
tention of the other irlmates- of the
house, who turned in an alarm for the
Fire Department. In the meantime
the room,' which is on the top floor,
was reached and the woman, who Is
over 60 years of age, was carried out
to safety. The fire was quickly, extin
guished, and the invalid, who suffered
from fright, was made as comfortable
as possible with the assurance of be
ing safe from further danger.

SUMMARY.
The Oakland Pitcher Is Batted Out
of the Box at Seattle.
SEATTLE, July 7.â Seattle and Oak
land played an interesting game to-day
despite the fact that the score ran into
double figures. Seattle batted Schmidt
out of the box. Cooper, who took his
place, also received a drubbinc.
Oakland touched Williams up in
spota, earning every one of the runs
made. Sensational fielding at almost
every corner of the diamond gave the
game the interest which is usually
lacking in slugging contests.
Umpire O'Connell put Deveraux out
of the game because. the latter insinu
ated that the umpire was a "fat head "
Carlo Smith got five hits out of five
times up. The score:

TACOMA. July 7. â San Francisco had
things all its own way to-day with Bar
ber, Harris' new acquisition, in the box.
St. Vrain started in fine shape, but in
the fifth, with two down, he passed
Barber, who scored on a couple of
errors. It was all off then with St.
Vrain. San Francisco got runs there
after whenever needed, Hildebrand and
Meany finding singles which counted a
total of three runs for the fifth. In
the sixth three hits and an error scored
three more runs for the visitors and
the Tigers could not overcome the lead.
To make it safe Hildebrand opened the
ninth with a single. A single by Meany
and a fumble by St. Vrain allowed him
to score. Barber was hit hard throueh
out the game and but for Tacoma's
errors and his own good support
would have fallen by the wayside. The

Loo's Southpaw, to-day for a home
run, a triple, four two-sackers and four
singles, the "Californians won out by
the score of 8 to 6. Nadeau was safe
in the first when Chase failed to hold
Smith's low throw. Nadeau started
for second, fell down and got up again
when he saw Chase was also prone on
the ground. He made his base.
In the sixth Ham Iberg broke into a
massacre. Three singles, a two-bagger
and Steilman's mistake, aided by Ray
mond's wobble, made three runs. Then,
presently. Beck drove the ball over the
left field fence for the longest home
run on the grounds this season. In the
ninth the players were changed around
and went utterly to pieces. The score:

don Bowing Club, in the final heat of
the race for the diamond sculls.

utes and 23 seconds, beating the rec
ord of B. H. Howell of New York in

The Supervisors' Police Committee
considered yesterday the matter of
granting a permit for the August pro
fessional boxing bout. The majority
of the committee had -recommended
that the Hayes Valley Club be granted
the permit on the ground that it was
the only club having a gymnasium, as
the law requires.
Harry Corbett of the Yosemite Club
said that his club had the June permit,
but was unable to hold the exhibition
owing to the injury sustained by Jef
fries. Mr. Corbett said the club would
lose its forfeit of 52500 if it did not pro
mote the Munroe-Jeffriea contest in
August. He declared the club had a
gymnasium in the Mechanics' Pavilion
annex, and the committee decided to
visit the gymnasium to-day at 2 o'clock
before taking action.
Morris Levy of the Hayes Valley Club
objected to an amateur permit being
granted to the San Francisco Club on
the 22d inst., claiming he was entitled
to a permit In the same week. Action
was postponed for one week.

CHICAGO, July 7.â Clifton Forge ran
one of the greatest races seen on a
Chicago track this season in the third
event this afternoon at Harlem. He
was a 4 to 5 favorite. At the start
Clifton Forge, which had the rail posi
tion, got into a jam and was badly cut
off. Feicht, who had the mount on the
colt, was hit in the eye with a clod
of earth. The colt dropped back to a
bad last. Feicht then went to work
on him. He was fully twelve lengths
behind Phil Finch, the leader, down the
back stretch and it seemed he was out
of it. He made up all of this ground.
In" the stretch he came with a great
rush on the outside and won by a
length from Phil Finch. The latter beat
Bragg half a length.
The talent gave the bookmakers an
avtful jar, as three favorites and three
second choices won. Jake and Firing
Line fell at the of the stretch in
the fourth race, and for a time it
seemed Jockeys Oregar and Feicht
were seriously injured. Feicht waa
thrown heavily, but bounded up like a
rubber ball, landing on the opposite
side of the fence. He was up laughing
and was not even bruised. Oregar did
not escape so easily. He was severely
jarred and his back was badly
wrenched. The track was slow. Sum

BRIGHTON BEACH. July 7.â Under
changed conditions of weather and
track, there being a heavy fog when
the first race was run and rain at in
tervals during the entire afternoon, six
races were run at the course to-day in
the presence of a large attendance. An
outsider won the first race and lonj?
ehots were first in the fourth and sixth
events.
The favorites which won were
Mineola and Hurst Park, both of which
outclassed their fields. As supposed
good judges were said to be backing
other horses in these races, false prices
prevailed. Under normal conditions
and on a fast track they would have
been odds-on favorites at the start.
Because Et Tu Brute, a California
bred colt, had beaten good horses easily
at Buffalo, he was well backed to win
the second race in which H. B. Dur
yea's Mineola, the ultimate winner^
Jocund. Rose Ben and Fine Art started.
Mineola went back in the bettiner. as
the track was becoming "greasy."
After Et Tu Brute had led for half a
mile Mineola, always close up, shot to
the front, followed by Jocund. The
Duryea filly, which only two days ago
made a new record at six and a half
furlongs, won easily. Summary:

Theodore Lowe, at one time e "itor of
the defunct Raven, a monthly publica
tion, is wanted by tne police on a
felony charge of obtaining money by
false pretenses. The complaining wit
ness against him is Miss Bell Doherty,
1072*Thirty-secc-nd street. Oakland.
She alleges that on June 16 Lowe
represented to her that he was the pub
lisher of the Raven and if she paid
him $130 he would appoint her his
stenographer and proofreader at $35
per month and give her a share in the
profits. He alleged that he had 52S0O
Invested in the paper and had a large
subscription list. She paid him the $150
and alleges that all of the representa
tions made to her by Lowe were false.
About six months ago Lowe was ar
rested en a similar charge, the com
plaining witness being a woman living
on Jones street. At that time the Raven
was being published and Lowe got the
benefit of the doubt, the case being dis
missed. A few days later Lowe had
the woman and her husband arrested
for threatening to kill him and the
cases were dismissed.

With few vessels in port, the freight

A Coroner's jury yesterday in an in
quest on the body of Mrs. George Cur
ry brought in a verdict of murder
against George Curry, her husbnad.
The testimony showed that Curry had
fired three shots into his wife's body
last Tuesday in her, room, at 35 Eddy
street, and that after surrendering to
the police he confessed having killed
his wife because she had left him.
Colonel Thomas â¢ V. Eddy, before the
Coroner and the jury, voiced his indig
nation against District Attorney By
ington for having secured from the
prisoner a sworn confession while Cur
ry was confined in the City. Prison.
Colonel Eddy remarked that the action
of Byington was in violation of the
ethics of the legal profession.
George M. Lipman of the Baldwin
Jewelry Company identified the pistol
with which the killing was done as the
one sold by him to George Curry last
Tuesday. He also, sold to Curry ten
cartridges to fit, the weapon.
Mrs. Young told the jury that Mrs.
Curry had told her that after she had
separated from her husband Curry de
manded money from herâ money which
Mrs. Curry had taken away when 'she
left him. . Mrs. Curry had told the wit
ness that Curry wanted half of this
money as belonging to him, and that
she had refused to k>t him have it. The
decedent had informed the witness also
that Curry had a revolver, but that
she was not afraid of him. While the
witness' was talking with Mrs. Curry
the Japanese servant entered the room
and announced that a man wished to
see Miss Josie Tripp. Mrs. Curry re
plied that that was her name, and left
the room. The shooting took place five
minutes thereafter.
Mrs. Mary Fisher, landlady of 921
Powell street, testified that the Currys
while they lived at her house appeared
to be a very affectionate coupflc. Curry
always came home promptly after his
work and Mrs. Curry was always home
to receive him. As the witness did not
know anything about the shooting the
Coroner choked her off.
Curry declined to make any state
ment at the inquest. Mrs. Curry's body
was sent to Santa .Ana yesterday for
burial.

The preliminary examination of Har
ry Radcllffe. charged with the murder
of Andrew Riley, hod carrier,' at Ninth
and Sheridan streets, early on the
morning of June 1% was begun before
Police ; Judge ' Fritz. Several witnesses
were' examined for the prosecution, but
nothing new '.< was elicited, their evi
dence 'being , the . same as ;.at' the .Coro-'
ner's. inquest. The examination will be
resumed this morning, i
The cases of fourteen women arrest
ed , for being inmates of the notorious
1129 Dunont street wereVremanded by
Judge Mogan till September 12, by
which time Superior Judge Cook, will
probably have decided the legality of
Police Commissioner Hutton's defiance
of his order that the place be immune
from police interference.
"All right, your Honor," Attor
ney Arthur Mack, representing the
women;. ''before September 12 we'll hav e
Police Commissioner Hutton doing time
in the County Jail."
Harry M. Blum, who has served two
terms in the penitentiary and is under
a felony charge in Judge Fritz's court,
was found guilty by Judge Mogan of
misdemeanor embezzlement and sen
tenced to twelve months. He stole two
sample cases from the Brown Power
Company and 500 cigars from the firm
represented by Police Commissioner
Drinkhouse..
Mrs. Edelstein, stalwart and com- I
manding. appeared as complainant
against her husband, Harry, puny and
shrinking. The charge was battery.
For a while the Judge endeavored to
maintain the dignity and order called
for by the time-honored rules of po
lice court procedure, but Mrs. Edelstein
ingenuously forced him to relinquish
the effort and sit helpless while, she
and Harry argued it out face to face.
Attorney Friedlander meekly informed
the court that he had been retained
fc-r the defense, and- Mrs. Edelstein
haughtily declared she could not per-,
mit him to have anything to say in the
case. "For I don't know you," exclaimed
the lady, "and I am sure that until
a few minutes ago you never saw
either Harry or me. So I will not al
low you to butt in. The v-e-r-y
i-d-e-a!" So she prattled on, while the
attorney tried to appeal to the Judge
and the Judge timidly appealed to the
woman until her breath was exhausted
and he got a hearing.
"Will you permit me, madam," he
i said, '"to say y word?" /.
i After a moment's reflection she mag- Â¦
nanimously said she would. "But,"
; she added, pointing at the attorney,
"not a single word will I allow that
j fellow to say."
"I merely desired to remark," said
I the Judge, "that the law allows any
person accused of an offense to be rep
resented by an attorney."
A shrill laugh of disdain was Mrs.
* Edelstein's response. "Why, all the at
torneys in the world," she' shouted,
"couldn't do that shrimp any good. An
attorney, indeed! The i-d-e-a! Come
up here and say what you have to
say."
Harry obeyed with an alacrity that
savored of force of habit acquired
through stern domestic discipline. It
was an impressive picture. The woman,
florid and aggressive, sat in the witness
chair and glared contemptuously down
at the pale little man who stood at her
feet, nervously fingering his hat brim
and avoiding her glare, while the court
breathlessly awaited the opening of
hostilities that seemed inevitable. In
response to an encouraging nod from
j his attorney the husband started to
! speak, but he had not uttered three
words ere the wife's tongue was wag
ging also. He spoke the dialect made
locally famous by Comedian Barney
Bernard, while she shouted atrociously
bad English with a Missouri twang.
! No attempt was made to stop either
j of them. Bailiff Hickey involuntarily
raised his gavel, but it descended slow
ly and failed to thump. . Clerk Grey
sat as one transfixed. The Judge's face
was -buried in a spotless handkerchief
I and an occasional convulsive heave ff
1 his shoulders was the only sign of ani
i mation he displayed. The attorneys'
table was in a wide grin. So were the
crowded benches. Â» 'Â¦'-â¢/Â¦Â¦
From the crimination and recrim
ination fired by the Edelsteins enough
was gleaned to piece together this bit;
of coherence. They were married three
ye,ars ago and never did get along very
well together. Finally they decided to ;
be' divorced, but Superior Judge Gra
| ham refused to issue a decree" on the
ground that neither of them had suffl
Â¦ cient ground of complaint against the
j other. So they agreed to live apart.
The woman engaged an apartment at
1136 Howard street, and it was there
the battery alleged by her was com
mitted on the Fourth of July. She was
sitting on the porch, she said, when
Harry came sneaking around, as he had
frequently done before, and sat beside
hec He accused her of improper con
duct with a policeman, name not dis
closed, and then he bumped her head |
j twice. With the aid of the landlady
I she routed him. Two hours subsequent
| ly, when she was returning from a
l nearby grocery with two bottles of beer
which she had kindly gone to purchase
I for another ladyâ as for. herself, she
never drank beerâ Harry again met
her and asked her to return and live
with him, as he was feeling ill and
needed nursing. "No," she said, "I
would not nurse you if I saw you dy
ing on this spot." He smote her again,
and with violence. All she wanted him
to do w-as to let her alone.
Harry admitted having vfsited her on
the nation's birthday, but denied the
battery. He simply went to agk that
she return his ante-nuptial gifts, con
sisting of jewelry and clothing, because
he had discovered that she punched
the eyes out of a portrait of himself
which he had given here ere they were
married. As for his accusations of im
proper conduct, he believed' they were
well founded, although he could not
furnish either the name or number of
the alleged policeman in the case. A
friend of his, Mr. Rose, had asked him
if he had a brother, and when he re
plied in the negative Mr. Rose ex
pressed surprise, paused by the fact
that last Sunday Mrs. Edelstein had
introduced to him as her husband's
brother a gentleman whose arm was
around her waist as the twain sat be-^
neath a tree in a sequestered nook of
Golden Gate Park. v v
; Mr. Edelestein had much more to tell,
but was suddenly stopped short by ar
rival of the noon hour and the court
asserting its authority to adjourn for
luncheon. Two weeks hence . the case
will get another inning.
- - * * *
It is probable that until they were
confronted by Mrs. Martha Edelstein,
tailoress, Police Judge Mogan and his
official aids never fully realized the im
potency of the law's machinery to up
hold the majesty of the law against
' the will of a determined woman. For
without actually subjecting herself to
! arrest for contempt Mrs. Edelstein
, bulldozed the bench, ignored the ad
monitory glances of the clerk and
scoffed the bailiff and his gavel into
! silence. She triumphantly said ail she
i desired to say and regulated the pro
i'cecdings to suit herself.
With a speaking tube extending from
his ear to the lips of Judge Mogan a
very deaf man registered as James Su
ters declared he did not desire to pros
ecute F. J. Jenkins for larceny, and
then F. J. Jenkins informed the court
that he must respectfully decline to
prosecute James Suters for assault
with a deadly weapon. Police Officer
Merchant testified that he saw Suters
pursue Jenkins, at California and Hyde
streets, until he overtook him and
plunged a pocket-knife blade into
his back, and that in expla
nation of the 'chase and the
stabbing Snters stated that Jen
kins had robbed ,him of some money
and fled with it. As the policeman had
not witnessed the stealing and could
not prove the stabbing, and as the de
fendants resolutely refused to testify
against each other, there wa,s nothing
else for the Judge to do than dismiss
both charges.
Frank Jackson, accused of stealing a
horse, harness and wagon, the proper
ty of the Haslett Warehouse Company,
is suspected.. of previous horse-steal
ings and Judge Mogan has continued
his case till July 12 to allow of further
police inquiry as to the man's charac
ter. The detectives have already dis
covered that his real name is Raoul La
Costa and that his criminal specialty
is the "lifting" of livestock.
So the woman whose only offense
was illness went her way, while the
Judge delivered himself of some re
marks that were not entirely compli
mentary to the municipal system
whose inadequate hospital facilities
compelled her to go to Jail.
"With proper attendance and medi
cines I think I can be cured in thirty
days," was the answer. "You'd better
give me thirty days, anyway, and if I
ain't cured up by that time I can get
arrested and sent up again."
"All rightâ thirty days."
ited the Hall of 'Justice and asked to be
arrested and charged with vagrancy,
as she wanted to go to the County Jail
for the necessary medical treatment
that had been denied her at the City
and County Hospital. The unfortunate
creature's request was complied with,
and five minutes after her arrest she
was before Judge Mogan.

CLAIRVOYANTS.
FROM ALL SECTIONS THEY COME TO WIT-
NESS THE WONDERFUL DEMONSTRA-
TIONS OF THE NOTED LIVINGSTONE.
He Is no imitator. His work Is upon original
lines: Pure thought, clear vision. He tells
you what you desire to know and works in thÂ«
open light.
He Is as conspicuous for his wonderful occult
analysis as he is for his original expression
and vivid truthfulness. -
A test reading Is not' a life reading: when
you call on Prof. Livingstone he will give you
a full life reading for $1: a test is of little
value; when the mind is troubled . you need
more substantial aid and advice; this Is Just
what Prof. Livingstone gives you when you call
on him for a flrst-class clairvoyant reading. .
He asks you no questions, but tells you what
you wish to know.
. Would it not be a relief to know how you
will succeed, to be relieved of the matters
that are troubling you, and of the schemes of
your enemies, that you may mett with better
success?:
He docs not mention all the ill* and misfor-
tunes you are heir to; you are acquainted with
the facts in your case;, let Prof. Livingstone
analyze the matters that are troubling you.
find the causs of the trouble and suggest the
remedy.
Â¦ . His only reason fcr'glvlng your name In full
or any important information you may deslr*
is that' he does this Incidentally as a chain to
read by.

The sum of $58,000 was paid for the
last seat bought on the New- York
Stock Exchange.. A few months ago
these seats brought about $80,000. This
slump in the price of exchange seats
is eloquent of the dullness in stock
dealings. Two years ago it was so
common for 1,000,000 shares to change
hands in a day that no comment was
made on it. Now if 1,000,000 shares of
stock should be dealt in on the New

would hug Itself for joy. Some "wire"
houses have gone out of business,
many have discontinued a large" num

The dropping of young fruit is
not due to insect pests, as it Is popu
larly supposed. More often it is be
cause of the fact that many varieties
of fruits are not self-fertile and the
blossoms require the contact of the
pollen of other varieties before they
will mature fruit. Not getting this
pollen, many fruit trees do not be?*r
at all or very much. The same trees
treated by the new methods of graft
ing and planting will often bear large
fruit and plenty of it. â Country Life

To use a camera in the southern
island towns means its polite but Im
mediate conflscat'on and a punish
ment by fine. By great courtesy, a
display of passports and a proper de
gree of self-reproach for having igno
rantly disobeyed the laws you may, at
the end of twenty-four hours, secure
the return of the camera, minus the
roll of films. So strict is the camera
regulation at fortified ports that an
Knglish lady who took a picture of
the captain on the bridge of one of
the vessels in the harbor of Mojl was
approached several hours later by
a member of the harbor police and
asked to deliver up her camera. Pro
tests were useless and the camera
was taken ashore, the films probably
developed, as they were never re
turned, and the camera was sent back
the following day.
On another occasion a traveler who
opened up a small pocket camera in
the streets of Shimonosekl was
promptly piloted to the station house,
violently protesting that he had done
no wrong and that he had not at
tempted to take any photographs of
fortifications nor soldiers. The diminu
tive and quiet captain of police, who
spoke English brokenly, remarked,
solemnly, "We will see." and the
tourist waited four hours while they
saw. At the expiration of this time
he returned and said, "What you said
was true, hue we shall, notwithstand
ing, be obliged to punish you with the
extreme severity of the. law in this
case. You have photographed no
fortifications or soldiers,' but you have
committed a crime", â and, while the
trembling culprit blanched in terror,
he finished â "and your fine will be
SO sen" (40 cents). â Harper's Weekly.

It is quite possible for any one to
own a forest of miniature oaks, which
may be grown even without the aid of
soil. In order to rear a miniature for
est procure a shallow dish and cover
the base of it with moss an inch
thick. Then set a number of good
acorns in rows about two inches apart
and a perfect little forest of oak trees
can be raised. The moss" must al
ways be kept very moist and the
acorns will begin to grow in the
spring. By June or July they will
have raised themselves six or eight
inches high and will form a charming
sight for any lover of trees. â New

An oiled tissue paper, which is as
tough as writing paper, can be had at
the stationers for wrapping up delicate
articles. Grain and meal sacks are al
most always made of -bark paper in
Japan, for it is not easily penetrated
by weevils and other insects. But per
haps the most remarkable of all the
papers which find a common use in the
Japanese household are the leather pa
pers of which the tobacco pouches and
pipe cases are made. They are almost
as tough as French kid. so translucent
that one can nearly see through them,
and as pliable and soft as calfskin. The
material of which they are made is as
thick ap cardboard, but as flexible as
kid.â Geographic Magazine.
Their oiled papers are astonishingly
cheap and durable. As a cover for his
load of tea when a rainstorm overtakes
him the Japanese farmer spreads over
if a tough, pliable cover of oiled paper,
which is almost as Impervious as tar
paulin and as light as gossamer. He
has doubtless carried this cover for
years, neatly packed away somewhere
about his cart. The "rikisha" coolies
in the large cities wear rain mantles
of this oiled paper, which cost less than
IS cents and last for a year or more
with constant use.
From the bark of trees and shrubs
the Japanese make scores of papers,
which are far ahead of ours. The walls
of the Japanese houses are wooden
frames covered with thin paper, which
keeps out the wind, but lets in the
light, and when one compares these
paper-walled "doll houses" with the
gloomy bamboo cabins of the inhab
itants of the island of s Java or the
small-windowed huts of our forefathers
one realizes that, without glass and in
a rainy climate, these ingenious people
have solved in a remarkable way the
problem of lighting their dwellings and,
at least In a measure, of keeping out
the cold.

The rapid destruction of the forests
of the United States, especially in the
Eastern portions, with the consequent
Interference with the water supply,
change In climate, etc., has for some
years been a matter of serious con
cern to the thoughtful citizen. A re
cent article by Dr. Henry Kraemer
emphasizes an aspect of this question
that is of particular interest to the
medical profession. This writer states
that if the present rate of gathering
of native herbs and drugs continues
for ten years it is probable that our
principal medicinal plants will be well
nigh exterminated unless measures
be taken either to conserve or cultivate
them. Inquiries indicate that some of
our well known plants are already
nearly exterminated. Among these are
spigelia, serpentaria, senega and cyp
ripedium. The possibility of improv
ing plants by selection and cultivation,
as has been done with coca and cin
chona, is an incentive to their study,
but of greater importance is a knowl
edge of the peculiar requirements of
each in order that they may be cul
tivated if this should be necessary to
insure their perpetuity. The follow
ing classification is given: Cultivated
medicinal plants in the United States,
190; wild Indigenous or neutralized,
178; foreign plants that might be cul
tivated, 56; foreign plants uncertain
as to cultivation, 75. This shows that
approximately three-fourths of all
medicinal plants are growing wild or
in cultivation in this country and that
of the remaining one-fourth probably
one-half could be grown here. The
article in question is very pertinent
and timely and should be brought to
the attention of not only physicians,
but also nurserymen and ; the laity,
who primarily must take the matter
in hand. â American Medicine.

besides which they must learn poetry
and prose by heart and imbibe religious
precepts. Those from four to five years
must read and write well, count un
limited thousands and do sums, besides
knowing their catechism and Bible, the
divisions of time, the parts of the bpdy,
the senses, some geography and as
tronomy, to say nothing of many other
details too numerous to mention. Then
come those between five and sixâ if
they arrive at that age. They must
read and write fluently, and learn by

DEL MONTE, July 7.â Mrs. Bessie
Gosbey, wife of Stanley Gosbey, super
intendent of the Del Monte baths, com
mitted suicide this evening by taking
cyanide of potassium. The Gosbeys
were divorced a few weeks ago, and
Gosbey, In response to a telegram from
his wife, met her at the railroad depot
here this evening as she was returning
from San Francisco. Mrs. Gosbey urged
her husband to allow her to return to
him, and upon Gosbey refusing an im
mediate answer to her plea threatened
to commit suicide, at the same time
taking from a satchel a package of
cyanide of potassium. Gosbey wrested
the poison from her, but she had con
cealed three capsules of the deadly
drug upon her person, and these she
swallowed before he realized what she
was doing. Death resulted in a few
minutes.
The tragedy took place among the
trees a short distance from the railroad
depot, the couple having walked there
while discussing their matrimonial af
fairs. The deceased was about 27 years
of age, and had married Gosbey about
eight years ago.

opening prices on September being up Uc to
He at Â«3*ic to S3%c. There was an active
genera! demand for both the July and Septem
ber deliveries, but offerings were exceedingly
meager. In consequence of the light offerings
the price waÂ» bid up rapidly, sentiment In the
pit being extremely bullish. The market was
governed almost entirely by news from the
Southwest. The most sensational damage re
ports of the year found their way into the pit,
flood conditions being reported from all sections
of the Southwest. A Kansas City paper esti
mated the damage in Kansas arid Nebraska at
6,000.000 bitehels. There was a report from
the Red River Valley statins that the crop
ther9 was in worse condition than it had been
since 1S84. On the advance a number of .local
holders took profits, causing a reaction. Sep

Strength of wheat and corn had a bullish
effect on the oats market. The market closed
strong and near the best price of the day, with
September at 32}Â«c.

In the day as the result of the weak tone in
the hog market, but the strength of grains
helped the market. September pork closed 5c

Choice offerings of small tree fruits were In
good request for local consumption and fancy
stock In small crates was wanted for ship
ment, and occasional sales of good shipping
stock were reported at a small advance over
the maximum quotations. - Low-grade oflVr
lnss of Plums, Peaches and Apricots were
abundant and could be bought at liberal con
cessions in the afternoon. Basket fruit from
the river was generally unattractive and ped
dlers were the principal buyers of that line of
goods. Apples and Bartlett Pears were steady
for the best stock, while second quality offer
ings dragged at unsteady rates. FIga con
tinued weak under excessive supplier and as
usual large lines had to be carried over Crab
Apples arrived v rather freely from Martinez
and Santa Clara end were offered at 50#75c
per hpx,' but found few buyers, as they were*
too small and green to attract trade Melons
continued to move off freely and the' best lots
cleaned up quickly at the top quotations. Sev
eral crates of Cantaloupes came in from Ba
kersfleld. the first of the season from that
quarter, and sales were reported at $4 per
crate. Al] kinds of Berries continued to drag
and the canners wore still buying large Straw
berries and Raspberries at the minimum quo
tations. Two 20-lb boxes of Â¦ Huckleberries
came in from Sonoma County, but were not
eold. having arrived too late for the regular
trade.

NEW TORK. July 7..â To-day's etock market I
was reactionary again and there was . very 1
heavy liquidation to take profits on the advance*!
of the 'ast two days. The reaction was only i
partly effective ia the early dealings and the I
market was protected by bidding up of such j
stocks here and there, but this policy became !
less effective as the day advanced and the re
j action bt-came general. There were some unpro-
J pltious features in the day's news, but not
I more so than yesterday, when they proved
powerless to affect the upward tendency of ]
prices. The reaction may be said to be due ae !
much as anything to the feeling of distrust of !
the character of the previous advance. The
unfavorable weather news had a depressing ef
fect. In view of the profit-taking nature of
the day's selling, the largest declines are not I
only found In those stocks which were most j
conspicuous in the buying movement, especially '
Union Pacific. Su Paul and Pennsylvania, but !
rretty much all the active stocks In the market
I figure in the list of from 1 to 2Â»$ points losers.
The closing was Irregular.

New York Stock Market.
The Butter market showed the effects of
the recent heavy receipts yesterday, especially
as another batch of 1372 cases came in. There
was no. actual decline, but all dealers reported
the market dull, with a tendency to sell, and
some were shading the quotations to reduce
their overstocks. .
The ftflinK In Cheese Is firm and the mar
ket Is In better condition and gradually clean-
Ing up at the quotations. Oregon, however. .1*
sending in large lines, and Puget Sound points
and Los Angeles refuse to pay even a fraction
over the current quotations in this market.
Dealers-<tay that any further advance Just
now tioukl shut oft these outside customers,
who's would Immediately go to Chicago for
their supplies, henee they are not disposed to
afk any further advance Just yet.
Th* Urmr.ess In Eggs continues, and some
houses report sales or fancy ranch slightly
above- the top quotation. These sales, how
evi-r, are ax yet hardly sufficient to Justify
a further advance, though the tendency Is de
cidedly upward, and fine stock Is getting
greatly reduced in supply. Receipts, however,
were larger again yesterday.

Docia Nolan, the "queen of the

dom and must spend the next eight
years of her life behind the walls of
San Quentin. The- Supreme Court
took -final action in the famous case
yesterday by denying the appeal of
the adventuress for a new trial. Her
male associates in the conspiracy have
all been convicted and sentenced.
The offense which Docia Nolan
planned and fostered and for which
she goes to the- penitentiary was one
of the most cowardly and brutal in
the grim, annals of San Francisco's
crime. The woman learned that Mrs.
Matthews and Mrs. .Tuttle had a large
sum of money and valuable jewels at
their residence at 543 Haight ' street.
One night she told her consort. Mich

John Davis, and Bernard Whitelaw.

Woman Who Originated Plot

alone In the house Whitelaw, Nolan
and Davis appeared. They rang the
bell and when the door was opened
by Mrs. Matthews forced their way
in. The aged woman was struck on
the head by Whitelaw and forced to
a lounge. The criminals then ran
casked the house, but secured only
$60 and a, gold watch. Whitelaw re
peatedly struck Mrs. Matthews on the
head with his revolver and threatened
to blow out her brains.
Bleeding from a score of wounds,
she finally sprang from the lounge and
opening the carlor door shrieked for
assistance. Whitelaw again pounded
her with his revolver and forced her
back. Mrs. Morris, who lived up
stairs in the same house, had heard
the cries, however, and crawling
through a window to the balcony she
also screamed for aid. The robbers
became alarmed and fled, but White
law turned back for a moment to
bruise and batter his aged victim once
again.
The men, when brought to trial,
tried to protect the Nolan woman, but
a note which practically^ established
her guilt was written in the City
Prison by her to her consort and in

RUIN' RUSTIC POSTMASTER
C. A. Jensen of Cordelia Holds Out
$1400 and Gets Into Trouble
With Governments
Conviviality and cards are said, to
be responsible for the downfall of C.
A. Jensen, postmaster at Cordelia in
Solano County, who was held for trial
yesterday by United States Court
Commissioner Heaeock on a charge of
having failed to deposit with the post*
master of San Francisco $1421 38 re
ceived from postal money orders and
the sale of envelopes and stamps.
The complaint was made by Post
office Inspector Dennis Coyne, who
had discovered the shortage on the
occasion of a recent visit to Cordelia.
Inspector Coyne testified yesterday
that Jensen had admitted his short
age and was unable to produce â¢ the
money when the witness made a for
mal demand for it. Jensen managed
to collect $821 38 from friends and"
turned that sum over into the pos
session of the inspector. Afterward
friends and relatives made up the re
mainder of the delinquency. * ,
The prisoner was admitted , to bail
on a bond of $500.
Judge Heaeock Returns.
United States Commissioner and
Master in Chancery Judge E. H. Hea
cock returned yesterday from his va
cation at Potter Valley, Mendocino
County. The Judge was very much
improved in health.
With all the self-assurance and
don't-care air of the man around town,
George Mario Buenaventura, alias J:
W. B. de Acevedoc, occupies a cell in
the city prison on a charge of forgery.
By the time Detective Ryan gets
through with the case more than one
charge may be pressed to prosecution.
The prisoner is now under arrest for
presenting a forged indorsement on a
draft for $100 to Du Val Moore, son of
George A. Moore, 208 California street.
The young man presented himself and
self-signed draft to Mr. Moore yes
terday morning. A letter of introduc
tion accompanied the draft, but the
moment Mr. Moore saw the signature of
Lawrence True affixed to the epistle
and also on the back of the draft, he
pronounced both documents forgeries
and summoned the police.
THE OLD STORY.
It is the old story of the butterfly
life. George Mario Buenaventura is a
native of Ecuador.. His father is a
physician employed by the Pacific Mail
Company at the Central American
ports and through his parent's standing
he was selected by the Ecuadorean Gov
ernment in 1897 as a promising pupil to
study mining and civil engineering in
the United States. In company with
three other native Ecuadoreans he was
sent to New York with $50 per month
in gold for ordinary expenses, the Gov
ernment defraying the cost of tuition
and the incidentals in a collegiate
course. '
His companions devoted their time to
study while he found the glitter of the
"merry-merry" more alluring and de
voted more time to the midnight bowl
than to the midnight oil. But he says
he completed his course at Columbia
University, and that hÂ£ is a member of
the D. K. E. fraternity.
WORKED ECUADOREAX CONSUL.
On June 4 the young man called on
Alejandro Noboa, Ecuadorean Consul
General. It took but a little while to
get in the good graces of that .official
and have him cash a check for $15.
There were no funds to back it, and
when that fact was discovered the mis
guided youth was taken before Cap
tain Martin. He promised never to do
such a thing again. Owing to -the
position occupied by Mr. Noboa. he de
clined to prosecute and in fact gave
the culprit much good advice, with
transportation to Los Angeles. The
transportation was accepted but the
advice was ignored, for George turned
up in San Francisco shortly afterward
and by representing himself as a mem
ber of the college fraternity induced
Thomas B. Bishop. 532 Mai-ket street,
to cash a draft signed by himself and
drawn on his father, for $100. Again
there was no money coming, hence
Bishop notified the police to be on the
lookout for the young man from Ecua
dor, and also informed his . friend
Moore to keep his eyes open if the fel
low tried to get any coin from: him.
The warning was heeded and the arrest
followed. .--
Buenaventura is 23 years old, and
says he has never been arrested before.
As he was being taken up the elevator
at the city prison he dropped several
letters of introduction, and also a
draft for $99 SO purporting to be signed
by D. C. Burke of Lps Angeles.-, His
record is being. looked. up by. the police.
LOS ANGELES, July 7.â According
to the city directory, just issued,* thera
is no person named D. C. Burke in>Los
Angeles, and in signing that name
George j M. Buenaventura. ( alias 'De
Acevido, used a fictitious name. Dana
C. Burke, manager of the City Di
rectory Company, whose name is near
est that signed, denies all knowledge
of the man under arrest. Members of
several families named Burke know no
person named D. C. Burke.
The interests of local capital and la
bor were focused yesterday upon the
hearing, in Judge Hunt's court, o5 the
euit of. E. G. Pierce, manager of the
Nevada Stables, against the Stable
men's union by agreement between
the court and the attorneys for both
tides, the case is to be tried as a test
of the rights of labor unions to main
tain pickets and prosecute boycotts
against employers of non-union labor.
At yesterday's hearing the courtroom
â¢was crowded by partisans of both
Bides. Pierce's examination and cross
examination occupied nearly all the
day. T. C. Van Ness and Bush Finnell
conducted his side of the case and
Judge Maguire appeared for the union.
"When the 'day ended the hearing was
continued until next Monday morning.
From the list of witnesses to be exam
ined the trial will run over until late in
the week.
Pierce, upon direct and cross-exam
ination, related in detail the facts con
tained in the charges of his complaint,
beginning with the strike initiated by
the Stablemen's Union on April 22 be
cause he would not discharge a non
union employe. This man, he said,
â¢was not engaged in any particular
vork but was put on to learn the run
of the business. The morning thÂ»Â»
Btrike was called his ten union em
ployes walked out, and he has not
eeen his non-union employe since.
GOT XOX-UXION CREW.
Pierce told In court of his efforts to
Jill his crew of laborers. In this he
euceeeded through -the help of the
Carriage Owners' and Liverymen's As
sociation. He recited in particular the
efforts of the union men to interfere
with his business. Pickets, he said,
â¢were stationed in front of his place.
From one to eight men carried ban
ners declaring his stable "unfair."
From ten to fifty men marched in a
circle in front of the stable during the
demonstrations, and their captain
called out in a loud voice to persons
passing on street cars calling attention
to the alleged unfairness of the stable.
Fierce said th^t he could not use his
men to raise hay into the loft without
paying fifty cents a ton for the service.
"When the strike was on the union
scared the Italians who were .removing
the manure from the place into desert
ing their job and he called upon the
Mayor and Health Department for re
lief. From the Mayor's secretary he
pot no satisfaction and when he noti
fied thf Health Department that the
situation was becoming a. nuisance he
grave notice that he had room for" two
more days' accumulation of manure
and after that was filled he would
dump it on the sidewalk and compel
th* Health Department to remove it.
Pierce told of threats against his
v.-atchrnan and other employes, and de
clared he had lost customers through
the acts cf mfn supposed to be repre
sentatives of the union.
STANDS BY OPEN* SHOP.
"When questioned as to his responsi
bility, or that of the Citizens' Alliance
for placing placards in the stable de
claring it to be an "opeD shop," Pierce
said that he had decided to run his own
business in his own way., instead of
letting the union run it for him.
At this point Judge Maguire suggest
ed that it would have been a good
thing if all organizations had kept oui
of the trouble and Mr. Van Ness re
pjjed tersely, "Undoubtedly."
Pierce admitted that he had said to
Finn, president of the Stablemen's Un
ion, that he would never take down the
"open shop" sign whether the union
xnen came to work or not..
After Pierce's evidence was in, C. P.
Monroe was called and he said that he
had been employed In a- laundry but
quit his job to offer his services to the
Stablemen's Union, and was made
"captain of pickets." In this capacity
he disposed of all the. unemployed
etablemen for service in front of
Etables supposed to be "unfair." He
eaid that he had only instructed the
pickets to call out, in a low tone, that
the 6table was "unfair," and he gave
the men orders to march around in a
circle in "the most conspicuous
places."
Monroe will be further questioned on
Monday.
As a lively finish to a dull day, the
prosecution in the Eppinger case
sprung a. surprise yesterday afternoon
when it offered the loan book in evi
dence. The defense was evidently un
prepared fcrr such a proffer and Attor
neys Ach, Shortrfdge and Dunne in
turn quoted authorities to prove that
the contents of the book were not ad
missible in evidence inasmuch as they
referred to transactions other than that
with which the defendant is charged
and no connection had been shown. In
response Attorney^ Campbell said:
W wish to show by this book that at the
time Jacob Eppinger made the alleged fraudu
lent statements by which he borrowed money
the firm of Eppinger & Co. wa6 already be
hind to the extent of $1.OOO,CCO and there was a
shortage of 30,000 tons In the warehouse. We
also intend to show that he Intended to de
fraud the International Banking Corporation
out cf its money. We have here collateral
evidflice that the firm knew its exact condition
and deliberately committed fraud.
TV. W. Topping, formerly bookkeeper
for the firm, occupied the witness stand
yesterday. From the hour of opening
court until three o'clock yesterday aft
ernoon he was kept busy identifying
checks. The prosecution last week of
fered a number of checks of the firm
signed by Jacob Eppinger to prove his
activity as a member of the firm just
prior to the failure. In return the de
fense to-day offered a stack of other
checks, covering the same period and
signed by Herman Eppinger. and Ber
nard Ettlinger. These vastly outnum
bered those signed by Jacob Eppinger.
After the checks had been, examined
Attorney Campbell asked on re-direct
examination: "Did you not say you
could tell the amount of the loans if
you had the loan book?"
"Y.es."
At this junction Detective Gibson ap
peared with the book and Attorney Ach
asked in an audible aside, "Did you
steal that book, too, Tom?"
"Can you tell by that book the
amount of loans outstanding that were
secured by the hypothecation of ware
house receipts?" was next asked, and
the witness replied in the affirmative.
Ach then objected to the introduction
of the book and after a lengthy argu
ment Judge Lawlor ruled that it might
be used to show the financial condition
of the firm at the time the loans were
negotiated.
The battle for possession of the
books, which was to have taken place
before Referee Green yesterday, was
postponed until Monday at 12:45. The
case goes on this morning at 10 o'clock.
