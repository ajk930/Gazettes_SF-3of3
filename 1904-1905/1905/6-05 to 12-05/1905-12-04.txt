LONDON. Dea B.â An Important speech
Â©n the relations between Great Britain
â¢aid Germany was delivered last night by
tbe Oermaa Embaeaador, Count Wolff
Metteraich, who was the chief guest at
ft dinner at the Lyceum Club, presided
trtr by Lady Aberdeen. The Embassa
6or said:
"We never ha 4 a serious quarrel with
Eaeland In the long course of our his
tory, and sincerely trust we never shall.
A ahadow unfortunately has fallen over
the two nations In the last few years, the
Â«auees for which it Is not difficult to dis
cover by those who read what daily Is
printed. The fact that I am your guest
this evening Is a welcome proof that the
forces at work are desirous of dispelling
that shadow of enmity.
"The overwhelming \u25a0 majority of Eng
lishmen and Germans wishes a Ufa of
peace and harmony and regards the idea
of a. serious Quarrel as a piece of crimi
nal folly. There Is no real cause for an
tÂ«Â«t>nfeni. commercial or_i oliisrKis*;-tl~ls
entj ~an atmosphere of .-ill -feeling artifi
cially created.
"The German U.Government ';\u25a0 will f? greet
Â»Ith sincere satisfaction any movement
tending to further yood relaUons and will
fladly respond to any friendly demonstra
tion In England."
EOOT REORGANIZING
STATE DEPARTMENT
Will 31ake a Clean Sweep of
the Attaches Now Under
Him.
Special lJlsr-atch to The C*U
CALL BUREAU. POST BUILDING.
TTASHINGTOX. Dec. 3.â Secretarj' Root
has decided to make a clean sweep of the
employes m the State Department. With
in one year the Secretary will have a staff
of essistants practically new. And this is
not in disparagement of the present force,
but because Mr. Root is pursuing in this
department, thp Â«ame policy to which he
held in the War Department, and which.
more than likely, made his administra
tion of army affairs such a decided suc
cess â he wJshii? to be surrounded by his
cwn people.
His first step on coming to Washington
was to dispense with â¢ Loomis as first as
sistant secretary. . Then followed the
transfer of Colonel William H. Michael
from the chief clerkhlp to the Consul
Generalship at Calcutta and the appoint
ment of ' Mr. Denby In his place.
A third step was the removal of Pendle
ton King as chief of the bureau of in
dexes and archives and his appointment
to bÂ« Consul at Aix la -Chappc-lle, at a
substantial increase in salary. No one has
yet beeu announced as King's successor.
The resignation of A. H. Allen as chief
of the library and rolls is directly In this
line. The greatest secrecy has been main
tlned regarding this resignation. No one
has been appointed to fill his place.
Although this completes the list of res
ignations and transfers, it is felt at the
department that others are to follow.
BUSH FOR BARGAINS
NEARLY CAUSES RIOT
Gloves Thrown Into Street
and Given Away in
Butte.
BUTTE, Dec. 2.â Traffic was temporari
ly Fuspended and a squad of . police re
eer\ r es was called out to prevent a riot
yesterday afternoon when SL J. Connell
and the D. J. Hennessy department stores
began dumping cases of; gloves into the
street after several hours of vigorous
pric* cutting, gpveraj. women were tram
pled upon in the wild scramble.: but no
one was seriously Injured. The experi
once Â«o*t the merchants involved "more
than $1300 and it I? estimated that more
than 2000 worklngmen were supplied with
gl*vrs grailF.
"Workingmpn's buckskin gloves. I , cent
p^r pair" was" the announcement dis
played in front of the Hennessy : estab
lishment shortly after 2 o'clock. The;
streets were crowded , with shoppers. A
moment later the rival merchant an
nounced "Ten pairs for 5 cents." Ten
minutes later ten husky Connell salesmen
carried five cases" of gloves Into the- mid
dle of the street between the two; estab
lishments and invited the â¢spectators to
help themselves and, a -wild rush followed.
The police by vigorous work prevented se
rious Injury, to. any of the participants.'

RIVERSIDE. Dec. 3.â From, a position
of wealth and eocial prominence Robert
yon . Schwarz. scion of a noble German
family and graduate of Cambridge Uni
versity. England, where he played half
back on the football team In the year that
It defeated Oxford, has separated from his
wife, a noted Southern California beauty,
and has enlisted In the United States
army. Intemperance brought about : his
downfall, and now his wife, who was Nel
lie Kenelly of Santa Monica, Is contem
plating a suit for divorce.
'Schwarz, whose " father was captain -in
the Imperial Cuirassiers of Germany,
came to this country several . years ago.
The elder Schwarz rained j distinction in
International circles because , he .was sent
from. Prussia to England to maintain -the
entente cordiale that then existed between
the two countries. While in Northumber
land County. England.; the former' cap
lain of the cuirassiers' met one of the fa
mous | bÂ«- utles' : in ' that 1 part iof " the, island
and : aftÂ«r a ; brief_ courtship married ;her.
iKobert ' iÂ«itbÂ«;rÂ«sult ;o/ Â«hÂ« union \u25a0Tand'it
was through :. vi.v" , mother* si solicitations
that he was sent : to; Cambridge. . "
The youth was quick to learn; and his
popularity- soon 'earned for . him* a promi
nent position oh the" Cambridge* eleven and
subsequently a place on the champion
cricket team of the British isles.;; He then
drifted to America, where" he -Joined; the
exclusive English colony at Riverside and
soon regained the prestige he' had" lost
across the water; He was made secre
tary of the Riverside Polo Club, . one ; of
the swellest social organizations; here.
Several months later, he met" Nellie Ke
nelly, the daughter of , Mrs. -Ellen J. ; Ke
nellj-, well known at Santa; Monica,. The
young couple were . married four -years
ago. They occupied a beautiful residence
at 455 Magnolia avenue, considered one of
the most magnificent driveways in South/
crn Calif ornlaT The .Schwars : horne r soon
became the â¢ center of social - gayety and
when the smart set perceived that it was
not opened this year the tongues of gossip
began to wag and it became apparent
that all was not sunshine in the polo
crack's domicile. . â . -
In the meantime the crisis had come.
Schwarz, who -had become addicted to
drink, had been Importuned time; and
again by his beautiful wife to forsake the
habit and avoid' the scandal that was sure
to follow his indiscretions" if he did not
give them up. Realizing that he could
not carry out her wishes . he caused his
wife to agree; to a separation; He then
surprised his most Intimate friends by en
listing In Company L of the Tenth Infan
try. United: States army, and joining that
regiment at once. Every effort was made
to secure his discharge, but- the private
of noble birth refused all assistance and
shortly after . secured a transfer to " the
Coast Artillery; and^ as a' member of . the
rank and file of , that service; he is sta
tioned with a siege battery at Camp Me-
Klnley. Honolulu. \u25a0
From letters received by his chums, M.
E. Flowers and H. R. Mackie,' two \u25a0 well
known member* ofthe exclusive set who
at ohe time kept bachelor^ quarters with
Bchwarz at Riverside, it has been learned
that Schwarz has been* urged to strive for
a commission, but the fact that he|is ; a
married man will militate against hiSjtak
lng an examination for *v the shoulder
straps.
Reginald yon Schwarz,. a brother, of the
Cambridge graduate, is now, in South Af
rica as semi-diplomatic agent to arrange
governmental questions pending between
the Empire and Cecil Rhodes syndicates. 1
He also Is connected with large German
Interests affected by the Boer war.; When
seen . at her y home in Santa Monica , Mrs.
Schwarz was reluctant', to talk -of <'th'e:af-'
fair, but corroborated the report that ; a
divorce probably would be sought-- . "â¢'-

SEOUL, Korea. Dec. 3.â The Emperor

The oody will be given a state funeral.
On Mm Yung Whan's body were found

Ex-Premier Chao and several minor

There Is some disposition here to
connect tho death of Mm ,Yung Whan
â¢with the withdrawal of the American

upon America as the most likely na

commenting on the appointment of

that Peru should be prepared In a new

American Secretary of State, to at
tend the Pan-American Congress at Rio

Is not wavering before the future, -the

that closer relations between the United

more capital and more enterprise.
The fears of some the gpanlsh-Amer

the Peruvians are absurd. Commercial
sway by the United States, the paper
contends, should be desired, as it would

and is the right man in the right place.

CALL BUREAU, POST BUILDING.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 3.â The Washing
ton Post printed this morning, under a :
New York date, a ' three-column _ article \u25a0 \
that purports. to give an account of the
funds collected by Chairman Cortelyou
and Treasurer Bliss of the Republican
National Committee for use in the cam
paign of lÂ»04. when President Roose
velt was elected. The Post says the I
story is authoritative. It is claimed !
that the figures given are the same !
that will be sworn to by -Treasurei '
Bliss and Chairman Cortelyou if they
Ko on the stand in the insurance in
vestigation :n New York.
The total fund of tbe Republican Na
tional . Committee Itt 11)04 Im placed at
$1,000,000. Tbe latrgeftt Mingle contri
bution vraÂ« $75,000 or 3100.00J, from an
uuUnov.ii Nuurce.
The fund of 91,900,000. Is compared
with the JS2.SOO.OOu said to \u25a0 have been
raised for the election of McKlnley in ]
1000 nud the *3.500,000 for his firm
caiupalfrn ia Ikm.
The fund expended by the Demo
cratic National Committee for the elec
tion of Cleveland In 1892 I* 'placed at
$4,100,000. '<-V
The Republican National Committee
is credited with having, had a balance i
of $100,000 at tht3 close of last year's J
campaign, the remainder of the fund.j
being accounted for as follows: Re- '
mittances to State committees, $700,000; '
for literature, $550,000; maintaining
Speakers* bureaus, $175,000; for litho
graphs, advertising, etc., $150,000; sal
aries and expenses at headquarters,
1100,600; miscellaneous expenditures,
$50,000.
While more than 4000 contributions
to the campaign fund are known, they â¢
tare said to constitute but 40 per cent;
j of the total number, supplying money, :'
the Identity of the other 60 per cent,
not being disclosed. One contribution
of $75,009 Or $100,000 was turned Into ;
Treasurer Bliss by one of the men so-!
licking 1 campaign funds and Bliss did i
not know the identity of the person
gfving this large sum.
The positive assertion is made that
neither Chairman Cortelyou nor Treas-,
urer Bliss knew that James H. Hydft'
made a contribution With the Expecta
tion - that Ihe would be. rewarded with\
the Embassadorshlp to France. It Is
said that President Roosevelt spoke to
Cortelyou of Hyde's application for the
position, but Cortelyou strongly op-;
posed the selection and did not indorse
the views of those recommending Hyde.
The bulk of the Republican fund Is
said to have been raised by committees
designated by Bliss, for work in New;
York. Chicago. Philadelphia. Boston and
other large cities. 1 These committees^
were subdivided, so that certain mem
bers would operate among men inter
ested In certain lines of business It Is!

listened to the impressive services were
some of the most prominent people of
the. city.
The stations of the lodge were rep
resented on the stage, where sat the of
ficers of No. 3. The decorations were
handsome. At the rear of the stage, as
is usual each year, the monster stuffed
elk" owned by the lodge stood on a
pedestal among the greenery, a sub
dued calcium light resting upon it.
After the orchestra, led by Paul
Stelndorff, had played a funeral, march,
the solemn opening services were held
by the lodge. Under the direction of
W. C. Stadtfeld a chorus sang "Lead.
Kindly Light." and ./the opening ode,
"For Auld Lang Syne," was joined in by
the lodge members. Bishop John W.
Hamilton delivered the invocation and
Miss Lulu Purlenky sang sweetly "O
Divine Redeemer."
W. F. Hofmann. a visiting brother, ren
dered an exQuisite violin solo, Handel's
"Largo." It was one of the most notable
numbers on the programme, the player's
execution being highly artistic.
John MeNaught delivered the ora
tion. He said:
"In setting apart one day In the year
for solemn observance In commemoration
of the dead, the fraternal order of the
Eiks has given formal and ceremonial ex
pression to a sentiment Inherent in the
human heart and common to men of all
lands and of all ages. Love does not will
ingly forget. Amid the multitude of new
impressions that are incessantly striking
In upon the mind, it reeks and finds occa
sion for turning aside from the activities
of the present to recall the past and the
memories of dear friends who no more
are numbered an.ong the living.
"We speak of such observances as trib
utes given to the dead, but we know full
well that the living can give nothing to
tho dead, and that all blessings and ben
edictlonÃ that flow from these ceremonies
come Irom the dead to the living, and are
due to a moral law which ordains that
v. nenever a man gives his heart and brain
wholly to thoughts of love and of death
h<s becomes conscious that tnere Is within
himself a spirit of highest faith that
claims kinehip with the immortals and
looks forward to a reunion with the be
loved in a life beyond the stars.
BUT~TYVO ABSOLUTE lIEAL.ITIES.
"In this world of shadows and of van
ities there are but, two absolute reali
ties â love that perpetuates the race on
earth and immortality which assure 3
the Â«>riÃtence of the individual through
eternity. Each of these is essential to
tiie dignity of human life. Without
them, man In the highest state of
earthly felicity would live as the brute
lives, and die as the brute dies; but
with them, even the most wretched of
humankind is so exalted as to fulfill
the saying of the Psalmist: *God made
man but little lower than the angels
and crowned him with honor and with
glory.* . . .
"Though separated by immeasurable
distances, love on earth and j immor tal
lty'in heaven are bound together by
cords woven of dlvinest influences, and
among 1 : the tenderest and most potent
of them all Is memory, that mystic fac
ulty which, by reminding us the
dearness "of .love lost, from earth for
ever, rouses in the soul a passionate
aspiration for a life where love Is Im
mortal. .

TVASHINGTOX, DÂ«o. 3; â The twenty

States* Civil Service Commission, made
public; to-day; contains a reoommenda
tion that Congress should authorize the
collection of ; a fee ' from applicants . for

the report . the commission will
issue ti manual giving- such detailed in
formation -' regardins the - examination
as will make it unnecessary for the ap
plicant to make special preparation for
these examination in some civil service
school: or 'institution. '
' 'The amount of > the fee, it .Is sur
ffested> should 1 be ; a atnall one. The
argument ln'iti'favor is that it would
eliminate f from the examinations -â¢ the
large number oi.-~persons' who take them
outcbf-. curiosity, or; to secure a higher
'rating-: on *he eligible ''- list, through re
examihation.: ' It ; i3r-stated that 1 30.000

ing the year, the number of- competitive*
positions Increased from 154,093 \u25a0to

Roosevelt* of November 17 last, giving
authority -to heads, of departments to

I e6H?-Gl|l.ofl BBrleapROANOKE'S STERN FRAME
IS BADLY DAMAGED.
HER INJURIES ARE EXTENSIVE
To Discharge Cargo
Before Going to
Drydock.
Month Is Required
to Complete
Repairs
It will take at least a month to repair
the damage sustained on the Humboldt
bar by the steamship Roanoke. Diver
John Roach made a submarine investiga
tion yesterday and discovered that the in
jury was more extensive than had been
\u25a0supposed. Not only was the rudder car
ried away, but with it went part of the
stern frame, and the whole stern frame
will have to be taken out.
The miFssr.gr part of the stern frame
broke off at the stern post, about two
feet below the arch, about eighteen inches
abovÂ« the keel and about two feet for
ward of the stern. The rudder post
snapped about four feet above the break
in the stern post. One blade of the pro
peller is missing. It seems more likely
That the vessels heel struck the Hum
boldt bar than that the harm was
wrought by a wave.
The underwriters decided yesterday to
discharge the Roanoke's cargo, and on
Wednesday the vessel will be placed on
Hunters Point drydock. It will take
nbout a week to remove the stern frame,
about two weeks to repair It and another
week to replace It. It will be an expen
sive job. but just how costly will not be
known until the vessel is drydocked and
Â« proper *urvÂ«y made.

ORPHEUM BILL
Entertains Audience With
Form of Juggling That
Is Novel and Exciting
FUNKY CASE MOXOLS
Provides Great Abuiidahce
of Laughter in Talk
About Father and Mother
Quite what to call Salerno, only the
best of his kind, is not known to me.'
lie 1? the king-pin of the Orpheum bill
this week, and the programme ; haa lilm
"Europe'? most dextrous juggler."
Jt further says "His riqual, Has Never
Keen tsrtu," which is true enough: ' But
jugfflinjr? The gentleman neither" grows
egKE on his heel, nor makes a rabbit
warren of his hat, which no good juggler
ever neglects to do. Nor does Mr. Salerno
even make the time-honored omelet in
a time-honored pocket. In, fact he \u25a0Is
shamelessly new, original^to recklessness.
iSven when you think you have himâ
with the usual hat on the usual .foot to
tip on the usual headâ you" haven't. He
has you. '
For on the top of tht; usual hat on the
usual foot is the unusual : cUrar," which
makes -for the unusual lip as the hat
makes for the head. This "juggler"â if
he likes It that wayâ does not seem at all
particular what he Juggles with. He took
everything in sight last nicht but Mr.
Rosner. For choice he se%med to prefer
playing with the cork that popped out of
the ' champagne bottle, the freezer, the
champagne, a table napkin and, hln assist
ant's toupee. Then be took the cham
pagne glass in his mouth, rim to lip,
stood on his hands on the table, picked
up the champagne bottle ' with his feet,
lilled the glass, laid the bottle on his head,
put his feet where they belong, handed
the bottle with his back hair on to his
noble brow, and drank the wine like a
veteran. Mr. Salerno finishes his turn
with a pyrotechnic" affair in electric
torches. But "juggling !". I never. sa.w
juggling like that.
The bill is a capital one almost
throughout, an Indifferent turn or two
to contrast with the rest. Charley
Case would say he Is a case in point.
He is. Mr. Case is almost too funny.
He is a monolog-ist who monols in a
quite new way. Dlxon and Anger do it
the other way â that is the one that
does the talk. Case has something of
the superb silliness of James J. Mor-'
ton. He has something also of the
adorable naivete of sthat admirable sil
licist. Otherwise Mr. Caew reminds of
no one. His stories arc all new and
newly told.
Mr. Case, who talks mostly about his
father, says that 1 his mother could al
ways tell svhen that gentleman- "hadi
been drinking-.
"The minute she went to the door
she could tell," he recounts. "We boys
never could. But* she always could.
Don't know how. We thought he was
dead."
The Peking zouave drill is another
star number. It is the slickest, swift
est, neatest thing of its kind ever seen
here. "
There Is much dancing, on the bill.
The Esmeralda sisters, with their four
assistants, have an \u25a0 extremely pretty,
turn, prettily, dressed^ and beautifully,
danced. "'The Hengler sisters are the
other danseuses. Now', the Henglers
are the vogue in New York. They. look
New York, with their dog collars of
pearls, Christy figures and general air
of swell girldom.
One felt one should be looking at them
through a bediamonded lorgnetteâper
haps It was because I hadn't mine along
that I felt a" little injured. The turn Is a,
little too "superior," too "refined." It is
pretty, graceful, dainty, clever, but with
overmuch of a "caviare-to-the-general"
air. One even suspects them of a design
to reform vaudeville! â¢ .

BLANCHE PARTINGTON.
Grand - Opera>Honie.
A big crowd assembled at the Grand
Opera-house #last night to Welcome
James Brophy back to the old home.
He Is Just as clever as in . those other
years, even If his life in distant cities
has added to his girth. All of the old
friends were there, from Henry Finkler,
his brother-in-law,' of airship fame, to
the gray-haired man who employedhim
for many years before he , discovered
that he was an actor. They gave him
royal greeting \u25a0 and his response was
highly pleasing and appropriate..
The play, "Shadows on the Hearth,"
was splendidly rendered by Brophy and
his excellent company. The' stage set
tings were particularly fine.' Some
singing specialties, which included
"Molly.' \u25a0 and "Everybody Works but
Father," brought down the house.
Estha Williams, the leading lady, did
well in the part of a suffering and self
sacrificing girl. Inez Bayard shone per
ceptibly with ; Brophy -and Miss
liams above the .others of the company.
There is some fun and a' great deal of
of the pathetic in the piece.
By special request Brophy and his'
company will present "At the Old
Crossroads" next Sunday afternoon and
evening. y

JETTY SYSTEM
IS A SUCCESS
New Method Used to Deepen
31 are Island Channel Is
Accomplishing Good Work
The Important undertaking at Mam Isl
and, by which it is hoped to create and
maintain a ship channel In the strait ade
quate in depth for any /war vessel that ,
enters the Golden Gate, has progressed !
bo rapidly that the prospective . value of -i
the work when completed is about demon- j
etrated. ; \u25a0
\u25a0; The '. channel as â. constructed ~ by., dams "â¢
built on both sides Isr'slowly'galnins. in
depth by the action of the current, which
â¢has sensibly" Increased- : 'in and '
rapidity. When Mare Island was first es
tablished the depth of water. in the strait
was nowhere less. than f ort}\ feet, \u25a0 and in ,
most places sixty feet v . That a contin- j
pency could ever arise of water bo shoal
as- to prevent any ship the Government
could build from approaching the navy
yard seemed impossible, but owing to the
vast amount of debris brought down from
the upper river and deflected into the
straits by the currents the channel has
gradually shoaled, until for several years
vessels exceeding seventeen feet In
draught were practically excluded from
the yard. A good deal of Government
money has been. spent in efforts to main
tain '_ a channel, but -heretofore without
bucc:es : Dredging was only temporarily
effective, the debris soon utj>bsiUiiji buck
again all thatwas taken out. A last and
final attempt; was determined ;upon by .the
Government engineers,' and the work has
been actively conducted for some months.'
The' plan is known as the 1 jetty system,
the same principle adopted with" success
by Eads ; at- the ( mouth'; of, the Mississippi
River, ; and contemplates j constricting | the
channel of Mare Island Straits on both
banks for- a: distance!. of ,! 2s,ooo: feet. By
this plan a uniform width of 1200 feet will
be maintained in the channel.
There Is but one permanent obstruction
in the straits, known, as Constitution
Rock, which ; projects/at low water, Ibut
leaves on one side ' a f channel 700 ; feet In
width. There Is a depth of 100 feet of silt
throughout.- By the operatlonaiof, lB9B the
shore line of Mare Island ; was ] straight
ened, and; 275, acres of new land .were
gained -by imeans ; of ; . the works, which
were built across the indentations of; the
shore. On the .Vallejo side ex tensive shore
line ; works have been In progress f or , â¢ a
year. These 7 consist of longitudinal arid
lateral dykes, : by which the channel; has
been . straightened by. the closing : of ; wide
indentations, | which It. is proposed *to fill
up as soon as: the dykes are, finished.
By means of the narrowing of the chan
nel the current ' running through the
straits will; be accelerated to such an ex
tent that a rapid scouring , of the' debris
will be effected. ;\u25a0 Even before , the com
pletion of ; the dikes y. recent soundings
show a sensible increase In depth
throughout . whole" length, -.; more rap^
Idly in ' some " places j than in "others,* giving:
the â¢greatest'encouragementUo those .who
advocated s the ' new plan.* Five spur dikes
have been: completed on r the; island, side,;
each 450 feet long and- 1000 feet apart, thus
giving ; 4000 -i feet of ' deep ,\ water $ frontage
when I the i dike joining : the ' four I spurs is
completed, /flic /Government - will " thus
gain forty ; acres . of , new land suitable for
warehouses or 'magazines. \u25a0

Dedicated to God
in Presence of
Large Crowd
Ceremonies 'Held<jn
THree Different
Languages.
The members of the First . Finnish
Evangelical Lutheran Church gathered at
the corner of Harrison and Essex streets
yesterday/ afternoon \u25a0' to attend the '. serv
ices connected with the laying of the cor
nerstone of what will soon be their.mag
nificent new church.
The ceremonies; were impressive and
were performed in- three ' different lan
guagesâFinnish, Swedish; and English.
On the highest \u25a0 point of the uncompleted
structure floated the American flag, un
der, which was the blue and white flag of
Finland. .
Rev. A. Reny'all,; pastor of the church,
took â¢' an active r>art in . the services
throughout the afternoon and carried the
programme' to ; a 1 successful "end. : . He ad
dressed the congregation In the Finnish
language, .and ; impressed those .present
with the need .of the church for which
they have" been working ever since they
were first : organized in 18?0 under the
Rev. Mr. ; Tarkkanen, who was sent out
from Finland Nt o conduct the work.
Rev. Philip Andreen; Ph.- D., pastor of
the Swedish .Ebeneser Church, Fifteenth
and Dolores streets,' gave'a short his
tory,. inVEngllsh, of the Finnish people
since Christianity was first established In
their land. Many great changes, ihe as
serts,' took place immediately after the
establishment of : the Protestant^ Lutheran
Church In thelrycountry/. Literature was
first spread throughout the country In the
form of prayer books and Bibles. This
was really the first. step In learning.
Several other addresses were given ; in
different languages by prominent minis
ters of the different Lutheran churches
about thÂ« city, after which the corner
stone was laid Jn the presence of a large
crowd. In the box were placed several
pieces of Finnish money coined In 1890,
several American coins, together with a
hlstor>' of tJie church from" thÂ« time it
was first organized in this city to the
present date, and the latest American and
Finnish. papers that could be secured.
. In 1890 the Rev. Mr. Tarkkanen. who
was sent out by the Finnish Seamen's So
ciety of Finland, established the first and
only Finnish Lutheran Church on , the
Pacific Coast. : The . church had : a \u25a0 rapid
growth from the start; >: and In" 1599 the
present pastor had it incorporated with
a view to building their place of worship.
They succeeded In raising enough money
to purchase the lot; ; with a considerable
margin for the building. At the present
.time there are about 3000 Finns In this
city, most of whom are members of this
church. .\u25a0 i
During the afternoon the following pro

SAYS SPECIAL
TOOK THE LOOT
John H. otÂ£ Declares That
Policeman of Albuquer
que Has the Stolen Coin
The police believe that John D. Ott, who
was brought back from Albuquerque yes
terday by Detective. Freel, has cached
the greater portion of the $1100 he stole
from Frank Johnson In the city where he
was captured.
On the return .triple hinted to Freel
that Special ', Policeman Jordan, who cap
tured him helped to conceal. the money.
Otto ; told Freel that : he had burled the
'money "ln? Jordan's stable.* He was. per
mitted by.-hls captor to go into, the sta
ble, and .while '" there, he claimed.*. ..he
"planted" the loot. The local police are
confident \u25a0 that " he, had ? the money .with
him when he was caught In Albuquerque.
Freel had great difficulty Jn getting the
prisoner. Jordan at first positively re
fused to*surrender him until the reward
of $25 , was paid. . After much bickering
Freer finally wired , to Chief, Dinan for
the money. The peculiar fact that Ott
had only $180 when arrested roused Freel's
suspicions. He : remarked upon It to Jor
dan. The special finally let Freel take
the' prisoner; without paying, the reward.
Ott contradicted himself several times
after reaching this city. Chief Dinan is
somewhat In. doubt as to \ whether , his
accusation^ against Jordan is true. Ho
will wire Albuquerque and have the mat-
ter sifted i to the bottom..
, Ott, who is a bricklayer, . robbed Frank
i JohnÃon, a ; brother In the craft, of $1100
in this city, several weeks ago. _ /
' The Chief i" of Police \u25a0, received a letter
from his wife in \u0084 the ; East " last Friday
asking " himi to 7 - locate her., husband. . She
is ; lgnoVant of his plight. - Most of ; the
money taken by. Ott was In bills.

with ramifications stretching into dak
land and throughout the county, that
the limelight turned upon young Mc-
Nulty when the first hint of his con
nection with the attack upon Dorothy
Olsen was breathed two weeks aeo.
To-morrow morning In Justice Ed
gar's courtroom Lester McN'ulty's ex
amination will be continued. Miss Ol
een may again take the stand, though
it Is believed her story has been com
pletely told. Her examination by Dep
uty District Attorney Brown and cross
examination by Attorney A. L. Frick
lasted for more than four hours last
Friday. The gold she produced and
which she swore was hush money, paid
to her by the McNulty family. Is in
Justice Edgar's possession, to remain
there until Its ownership Is definitely
determined.
Curiosity is intense at this time con
cerning the manner of defense that
McNulty's attorney may have advised
hira to make. It Is believed that Mc-
Kttltjr will not offer any evidence at the
preliminary examination, but will re
cerve whatever .testimony may have
\u25a0been prepared In his favor for his trial
In the higher court.
Conductor A. G. Alvls. who wu in
charge of the street car on which Mc-
Nulty and Miss Olsen rode as they
came from Oakland on the night of the
assault, is to be the principal witness
at the examination to-morrow. He Is
to testify that McNulty eat behind Miss
Olsen. that he carried a light overcoat,
tnd that he alighted from the car a
few seconds after Miss Olsen had left.
Other witnesses who may - be sum
moned are prepared to tell of Mc-
Nulty's movements in Oakland on the
night of the assault up to the time he
boarded the car at Thirteenth and
Broadway, on which Miss Olsen rode.
The ownership of the overcoat which
Miss Olsen retained after being at

ELOPERS ELUDE THE POLICE
ROMANTIC GIRL. AXD MARRIED MAN WHO ELOPED FROM BERKELEY. THE
POLICE HAVE BEEN SEARCHING DILIGENTLY FOR THEM. BUT THUS
FAR HAVE FOUND NO TRACE OF THE PAIR.
BERKELEY, Dec. 3. â Benevolent
people of Berkeley, whose Interest and
sympathy have been aroused by the
pathetic story, of Mrs. Jacob Waldorf,
the woman whose husband deserted her
to elope, as alleged, with Miss Ada
Moore of Oakland, are planning to pro
vide her with a means of livelihood
and with support for herself and two
1 tiny children.
Mrs. Waldorf's landlady, Mrs. N. Wil
liams, to whom Waldorf owes money
for the lodging fcf his family, is, pre
pared to swear out a complaint against
him on the charge of defrauding an inn
keeper, in addition to the complaint by
Mxs. Waldorf, the latter being .based
On a charge of failure to provide.
Miss Ada Moore, the pretty young
woman whose love letters to Jacob
Waldorf proved the latter's undoing in
his family, remains completely hidden,
so far as the police of Berkeley and San
Francisco are concerened. The young
woman's Infatuation for the fickle
candy drummer, with whom she had
maintained a love letter correspondence,
has convinced all concerned' ln the t ease
that she is now in Waldorf's company,'
the twain hiding successfully from the
police.
Mrs. "Waldorf's condition is pitiful In
every respect and those who have been
acquainted with her, family life do not
hesitate to declare their belief that for
cold-blooded brutality and cruelty, with
a complete lack of moral sense .and de
cency, her husband "has almost ex
ceeded, the limit.
Mrs. Waldorf's youngest child is but
5 months old. It was born a month or
two after the young wife's return from
Chicago, where she "declares the hus
band had sent her in.the hope of being
rid of a companion of whom he bad con
fessedly tired. She was sent away to
Chicago by Waldorf, without, funds to
return. In a critical condition' and with
no resources "In Chicago. Her belief
now is that the trip East was expected
to provide Waldorf . with : ground
charging her, with desertion so
he could sue her for divorce and wed
Miss Moore. '
She is now contemplating bringing a
felony charge against Waldorf and will
be guided In 'this by the developments
| that the police may uncover during the
i next few days. -- . : . â¢

TOURIST HOTEL ASSURED
New Company Secures Large
Tract of Land in Clare
niont for the: Building
OAKLAND, Dec. 2.â Real estate dealers
of Oakland are evincing great interest in
the newly organized Chamber of Com
merce,, and nearly all the leading firms
are now represented in the new organiza
tion. JAt the last meeting of the Cham
ber of Commerce, held Friday evening in
the rooms of the Athenian Club, the re
sult "of work .done : by_the brancti of
the membership committee" to which was
intrusted the task of bringingthe local real
estate. dealerE Into the Chamber of Com
merce was manifested by the large at
tendance of real estate- men, .- and nearly
allthoso who attended the meeting sub
scribed to the membership roll at the
close of the meeting.
The much-talked-of tourist -.hotel for
Oakland now seems likely to become an
established | fact j next . year. . A company
has recently been formed for the purpose
of erecting, and; conducting a first-class
tourist hotel in the Claremont district,
and the I promoters of the new
have already purchased fourteen acres of
beautiful property, consisting of the tract
known as the Ballard estate, at the end
of ,' Claremont avenue, , on which the new
hotel wlir be erected. : , ,
The San Francisco, Oakland and San
Jose Railroad has , agreed to extend a
branch of the Key Route to the grounds
as soon as : the new hotel -is built. The
plans for the structure have not yet been
completed, but It is the intention of the
company/ to erect a building containing
200 rooms and surrounded by grounds
which will be second to none in the State.
The building will coat about $250,000. \ The
hotel company will, have an authorized
capital ,of $300,000, , more than half of
which has already. been subscribed.
Real estate dealers are well satisfied
with the present conditions of the Oak
land and Alameda - County market, the
month of November having broken the
record \ot any year In the past. While
there j have, been few large, transactions
in business and manufacturing property,
there has been an unusually large volume
of small business, which has kept all the
dealers busy... .
The . number of new buildings now be
ing erected In Oakland Is unusual for this
time of . the year and indicates that a
large percentage of the sales of real es
tate in the- last few months have been
made to newcomers In this city, who have
purchased property for the purpose of
building homes and becoming permanent
residents of Oakland. Nearly all of the
houses now; in course of construction are
of a type .which show that their owners
are people; of well-to-do character.':, /

ODD RESOLVE
OF AUTHORESS
Makes an Early Decision to
Wait Until She Was thirty
Before Publishing a Book
Special Disratch to The Call.
LONDON, Dec. B.â Much .would be

publishers and critics, if all would-be
romancers --would' \u25a0.\u25a0 exercise . such .â¢ re
straint ;as i was practiced for many
years by Mrs. Henry de la Pasture. Mrs.
de la Pasture is one of ! the -most fin
ished' of English authoresses ' and per
haps owes this quality largely to the
unusual check which she placed on her
self at :the outset of her literary
career. ; Like most authoresses ; who
have secured successes she was a
"scribbler"' from childhood; but though
ideas for, novels were 'continually pop
ping into her head and occasionally be
ing; utilized," /she made an early deter
mination not to ; publish a book before
she was 30 and kept her. word.
5 The : good % results ;of this ' somewhat
heroic resolution 'were plainly "apparent
in Mrs. do la Pasture's first book," which
saw; the! light- in; her thirty-first; year
and was called "Deborah of ;Tod's." '-' It
made a genuine success and was fol
lowed, two years later. \by "Adam Grlg

The ordinance was enacted by a vote
of six to five. Under the law the bid

Farmer Commit a . Suicide.
SAN LUIS OBISPO, Dec. 3,-r-John El

Drood really dead, and If so, who killod
him?" It has usually been assumed
that Dickens' hero was .actually de
funct and met his end at the hands of
John Jasper and this view was, I think,
taken by J. Cumlng Walters," whose re
cent book, "Clews to the "Mystery of
Edwin Drood." restarted the old discus
sion. Walters also had an ingenious
theory as to the true identity of the
mysterious Datcherley, but' his book
was : fallen upon severely by several
prominent Dickenslans, chief â¢of them
Andrew Lang. who. expressed the belief
that Drood was not dead at all.
So Fildes, who could have made a
lot of 'money.at any time by giving the
information to a publisher, seems to
have thought the moment ripe for tell
ing what he knew and he did so In a
letter to the London Times. Fildes, by
the way, is now a member of the Royal
Academy ? and has painted . several pic
tures of both the King and Queen. He
made V.. the ". illustrations for "Edwin
Drood" when it was appearing in
monthly parts, .and, 'as usual in the
case of Dickens' illustrators, received
many Instructions from the author.
The novel was well advanced when, in
a V rough , proof â¢of one, of the monthly
parts sent to Fildes, Dickens particu
larly described John Jasper as wearing
a neckerchief of such dimensions as to
go around his neck twice.
"I 'called, his! attention,", says . Fildes,
"to the circumstance that I had \u25a0 pre
viously drawn Jasper as wearing a lit
tle black tie once round the neck, and
I asked him if he had any special rea
son for the alteration of Jasper's attire,
and, if so, I submitted I ought to know."
Fildes says that Dickens appeared for.
a moment to .be disconcerted by the
question and said .-something, meaning
that he was getttlnj on too fast and
revealing more than he : meant . at that
early : stage; ? and it- was after a few
minutes of cogitation that he suddenly
inquired as to the artist's , capacity for
keeping" a secret. And, it seems that
after she had been assured upon this
point, Dickens r said:; "I must have the '
double > length tie! It is necessary, for
Jasper strangles ' Edwin Drood with it."
So ends a mystery that has not been
less ; baffling nor, less r fiercely, discussed
than the ". puzzles as to * who j wrote the
Junius letters and who was the man In,
the" iron ; mask? ;â¢; c \u25a0 ',

CONVENE TO-DAY
rr^sident's 3lessage and an
Emergency Canal Bill Will
Be Features of the Week
NEW FACES TO BE SEEK
Brandage, Warner. Frazier
and La Follette to Be Add
ed to the Koll in the Senate
WASHINGTON. Dec. 3.-Nothing but
preliminary work will engross the atten
tion of the Senate- this first week of the
session. The Senate is already organized,
a* It Is a continuous body, and beside
there was a special session last spring,
when the new Stnator were sworn in. Sen
ators Brandace of Connecticut. Warner of l
{ Missouri. Frazier of Tennessee and La
Follette of Wisconsin have not yet taken
their oaths. The two former had not been
elected when the special session adjourned.
Monday will be a very short session, and
the Senate will adjourn out of respect for '<
the late Senator Piatt of Connecticut as
coon as the necessary formalities for the
beginning of a new Congress have been
concluded. On Tuesday the President's
message will be received and read and
Wednesday is likely to be devoted to the
introduction of bills. Aehort session will be
held Thursday and the Senate will then
adjourn until the following Monday.
It Is quite likely that a Republican cau
cus will be held on Tuesday or Wednes
day for the purpose of authorizing the
appointment of a committee to fill com
mittee vacancies in the Senate and for the
election of a steering committee for the
session. It is expected that the committee
vacancies will be filled very early in the
eesslon. If the House of Representatives
ehould pass an emergency appropriation
bill for the Panama canal the Senate will
at once take it up and pass it, but this
measure is not expected in the Senate
until the second week of the session.
Very little beside the organization of the
House will be accomplished during the
first week of the session, although it is
possible that an emergency appropriation
for the Panama canal may be passed the
last of this week. Until the committees
are appointed such a bill would have to
be considered by unanimous consent or
under a special order. It will depend
upon the canal finances whether the emer-
L pency appropriation will be rushed
fihrough this week or go over until the
week following.
The leaders of the Houso have been in
formed that the emergency appropriation
will not be needed until Deember 25, and
consequently the bill may not be passed
until next weelc
Monday will be taken up with the elec
tion of a Speaker and other House offi
cers. They will be those nominated by
the Republican caucus. It is already un
derstood that the rules of the last House
will be adopted after the membra have
be? 11 sworn in.
The biennial lottery for seats will be an
interesting occasion on the first day and
at its conclusion the adjournment will fol
low. Tuesday will be devoted to the Pres
ident's message and that will probably
close the real business of the House for
the week.
Speaker Cannon has not yet completed
his committees, but it is expected he will
be ready to announce' them early in the
session.
" Bills will be introduced every day that
the House is in session from the begin
ning and will be printed and referred to
the committees when appointed. It is ex
pected that many Important propositions
will be presented during the early days
of the session.
DC.ILERS PROTEST AGAIXST
DISTRIBUTION OK SEED
AÂ»lc the President to Recommend That
the Practice lie Abolished a.
Unfair.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 3. â Thirty of the
leading seed dealers of the country
have sent President Roosevelt a peti
tion protesting against the free dis
tribution of seeds by members of
aud urging him to include In
his message a paragraph disapproving
the present practice and recommending
that only the Intent of the original act
authorizing: seed distribution be the
future policy. This intent, the petition
tays, was that the seeds should be ob
tained from remote corners of the earth
tnd be for the purpose of Increasing
the wealth of the nation.
The petitioners allege that the pres
ent practice Is a "grievous restraint of
trade" and that the United States
thould abolish the practice as unfair,
as class legislation, antagonistic to a
branch of commerce and unbecoming
a great Government.

MONDAY DECEMBER 4, 1905
A QUIETER HOLIDAY â¢ WEEK.
THE business of the country last week was materially reduce*!
by the Thanksgiving holiday, which Avas reflected in 'the
apparent loss of 18.S per cent in the country's bank clearings.
There were certain other causes to contribute to the.falling off in
2iis exhibit, such as a decreased movement in distributive trade
owing to unseasonable. weather during the early part of the week,
the holding back of cotton by the Southern planters and by the
quieting down of several staples heretofore very agtive. But the
mijls and factories continued to send in good reports of machinery
almost fully employed, with plenty of new business offering, and
there were no serious labor troubles to obstruct the regular channels
of trade. The railroads continued to report larger earnings than
during the corresponding period in 1904, and the^failures for the
week were only 203, as compared with 245 for the same week
It must also be borne in mind that trade almost always quiets
down about the first of December to what is known as the winter
lull, and that it remains more or less quiet until after the turn of
the year. So there are plenty of reasons why business activity
should exhibit some relaxation without causing unfavorable com-.
The money market showed no. marked, change during the week.
.Conditions continued unsettled, interest rates fluctuating sharply
from day to day. with the tendency upward. Funds are now in
an uncertain condition in all of the bourses of the world. The
floating of the Japanese loan, preparations to meet the approaching
January dividend and' interest payments, the uncertainties involved
in the Russian political upheaval, the drafts upon the coin reserves
wherewith to move the vast American crops, the excited condition
of the cotton market, the rise in silver which has disturbed exchange,
and a number of minor factors, all conspire to deprive the money
market of that wonderful steadiness and stability which have
characterized it for a year. Conservatism is being preached more
than ever. This is exemplified in Wall street; where the public
are disposed to plunge into speculation, but are restrained as far
as possible by the banks and other large financial interests .which
emphatically say that the present is no time for a bull movement
in stocks. In fact, on any rise in stocks blocks of shares immedi
ately come out. suggesting that the large interests are selling at
every opportunity. -
But notwithstanding this readiness on the part of the large
-interests to sell we seem to have entered, upon another era of
speculation. This is shown by the current activity in cotton and the
copper stocks, which have been quite prominent of late. The
various estimates of the size of the cotton crop have rendered the
market for that staple very unsettled and it has been pulled and
hauled about in a most unceremonious manner.
Conditions on this coast continue bright. Additional rains
have set the plows running in many districts previously" dry and
started the grass where pasturage ' had given out. The long dry
period has apparently been broken and the outlook for another good
farming year is now encouraging. Business in" all branches,
domestic and foreign, wholesale and retail, , is reported. excellent,
building operations are still very active, the mines, -and irrigation
'districts have now snow enough in the mountains y to relieve them
of their previous apprehensions, and, in brief, there is nothing
visible at present to create any expectation of anything else than
another good agricultural, industrial and mercantile year. \ ; *f
It is remarked, however, that the demand for farm staples -is
hardly as sharp as at this time during the- past few years. THis
"may be due to the prevailing high prices or to the gradual over
taking of consumption, or to the: cessation of the Oriental demand
. caused by the recent Russo-Japanese war. While that war lasted
the Pacific Coast sold a vast amount of forage. and-breatLiuffs to
both belligerents, and the elimination of this profitable business
naturally renders this year quieter; than .its two immediate pre-
ORGANIZATION A CURE FOR POVERTY.
BRITAIN is so close to us because of kinship of race and simi
larity,oorf r institutions that its atute sociological troubles con
stitute for us a subject of keen interest. .The. poverty, threat
ening in the mother country because of the inability of tens of
thousands of its people to find employment comes very .near to us
as a matter of sympathy, and if we; do not pay attention to the
threat of this discontent^nd continue to be more resourceful than
â¢the British in the control of industrial conditions this evil of non
employed poverty may come to touch us closer home. The chief
remedy proposed for the. British trouble is "back to the land," that is,
tq the development of small agricultural holdings into self-sustaining
homes. ~* :; U-
If the design of dividing up big holdings of agricultural lands
into small homes be carried out there may be relief from .much
â¢ofÂ«the poverty and consequent political "discontent which is now em
barrassing the British' Government. Such movements /vhen wisely
planned and approved by, the ; test of time become of course parts
essential in completing the functional power. of the social organism
as a whole. Ever as we perfect that, great organism there- can 'be
little doubt the ills of poverty and lack of employment, as well as
of most of our social troubles, will become less.
â¢ In regard to the present troubles in Britain and to the great
immigration problem which constitutes a present threat to our couiit
.try, there-niight.be pertinently connected a recent statement 7 as to
our industrial needs for which the .. Boston Evening Transcript. is
# authority. That paper calls attention to the- wide sweep of oppor
tunity that still awaits 'both men and women -in agricultural sec
tions, not only in the West, but the paper says* "right here* in New
England." It even puts it that one of "the 'great troubles that the
farmers have to face" is the lack of help both indoors and outdoors. r
This condition of lack. "of help lasts for at least nine months of the
year. It states further that if the new comers could be properly
distributed to where they are most needed the immigration problem
would be relieved of half its complexity. ' /
One part of the world's population appears in alrn.ost desperate
discontent because of non-employment, and another part suffering
for labor to make use of nature's bountyT; Surely a more. perfect
system of mutual helpfulness, co-operation more thoroughly planned/
the mechanism of the' social organism more wisely devised i or ; more
extended both as a matter of philanthropy and of statecraft; would
quickly cancel these two needs by simply bringing them in contact.

the honor of having introduced the snake

Dogs, cats and birds, the usual house

she prefers her magnificent Indian py
thon. This docile reptile is something
more than nine feet long,' has consider

of "this intrepid woman the python is as
good as a kitten. He loves to twine him

tress with his tail resting on her shoul

..So far there has been no disagreeable

On the contrary, the python exhibits a

.low stains on his finger-nails. Besides, he
lived. on his relations.. He went through
three universities, and "thence post-gradu
ated to Paris, whither, he traveled to ab
sorb some atmosphere.
He returned a finished artist. .He must
have been good, -for, ..when he entered a
museum, he could tell at a glance, where
Raphael fell down, how bad' Velasquez
really was, j where MurMo was weak, and j
why Rubens turned out so much poor!
Ftuff. It was he i who discovered the Bra
blzon Schoolâ he called it that himselfâ
is not what it Is said to be, and that Sir
Joshua Reynoldsâ he hailed him as Josh
was poor on-brushwork.~ â¢ i
Meanwhile he . lived in a hallroom and
wore .flowing neckties. ' His shoes were of
varying patterns and | his clothes ' were
stylishâ in 1863. He slept most of the day
and walked around all night. When one
Inquired wherefore, he answered proudly,
"I am a bohemlan." \u25a0
He ate sausages cooked over a candle in
a plug hat. and slept_under the carpet
near the '\u25a0 floor. ' He . announced that all
marriage contracts: should contain a two
weeks' clause,)' and. that all property
should be divided among everybody. He
borrowed three dollars from anybody who
would lend It to him; falling 'three, hÂ«
borrowed two, or evenâ from a ; stingy
friendâ ten cents. He paid no one and
never Incurred a laundry bill: When one
would inquire â¢' whÂ«ref ore, he : answered,
proudly, "I am a bohemian." â¢ /
One day the artist* "arrived." \u25a0

"Do my \ subjects appear to be satisfied

"Wellâ yes," . was the hesitating, an

fied, but not so doggonedly- satisfied: ."I
should describe it. as a plain, ordinary,
fifth-class, three- for-a-nickel satisfaction

"Don't they- like the- Soup of. Liberty

that they would have preferred a -large,

"But I have given them the right to

; ."Yea;, sire; but they claim ., you only
gave it to them because you were afraid

"Do ' they so, the churls? But I also

a chance to buy some; o'f them." ;
"Yea, sire; bUt they ungraciously insin
uate that they could buy land anywayâ if
they had the money, to do so.". . . .
"What more do they want?"
. "The^e are,' sire, those who desire your
crown, for they claim that accidents of
birth shouM not count, and who treason
ably suggest 'that your head would look
well where that of John the Baptist was
placed. Yet now I* do think that they

remarked. . .
"What is strange, sire?"
t ! "Why, that *Is exactly ' what I fear on

Then the Czar retired to his bomb-proof*

MIRROR OF DAME FASHION.
THE DRESSIER TYPE OF SHIRT WAIST.
W1111..E plain and severe enough for wear with a tailor-made ifown of tiÂ»
usual kind, this smart design is at the same* time dressy enough tÂ»
wear with a velveteen skirtâ a combination that is highly modish
nowadays. On a fitted lining the back is disposed with stitched tucks In thÂ©
shoulder" seam, those stitched but for a short distance, and then drawn down
in a pretty line to the waistband/ The front has the fashionable chemisette
applied flat on the lining, and fastening over lnvtelblr on the left side. ThÂ»
materialâ it is a chalk white henriettaâ has the tucks at the shoulder seam,
to provide fullness, a pretty cut out below the throat to display tbe chernt
sette.-and a fancy guipure for a border. The sleeve 13 an exceptionally
pretty pattern, .full and puffy, sprung out with little featherbonÂ© loop 3 at thÂ«
3houlder, and having a frilled cuff below the elbow. The deep-fitted cuff of
lace is mounted upon a featherbone ring, 30 that It may be applied with fancy
pinsâ which are intended to show on the outsideâ when a lons-sleeved
waist- i3 desired. The close fit of thi3 design renders the dress shield Indis
pensable, even to those who ordinarily do not reauire It.

"MAKE UP YOUR MIND"
ANGELA MORGAN
WHATEVER you do, cultivate de
cisiveness. Don't worry away
your strength, your health and
; ' your happiness in a protracted
struggle to > "make up" your mind. Make
it up; and, once having done so, let It stay
made up. Learn to decide.
' Whenever I go into a store and see the
rows of worried, pondering, hesitating
women lined up before the counters, rack
ing their grains over, ribbons and gloves
and laces, I -am -'moved to utter this ap
peal. V " _ ' ~ . . \u25a0-
-.To me the sight of a woman permitting
herself to be , distressed' over a card of
buttons or a yard of ; lining is not so ri
diculous as it is pathetic* It hardly seems
possible that a human being endowed with
will power and the capacity to judge
should fall so completely to employ that
will power in developing that Judgment.
But this; is '<â¢ the falling of the average
woman, and - for - this .reason her life is
more troublous. than man's.
The only way to acquire good judgment
is to practice judgment. Strange to say.
women dislike. to do this.
There seems to be In the feminine make
up a sort of inherent dread of relying
definitely upon that faculty we term Judg
ment. The average woman hesitates as
long as she possibly can before taking a
golden rule there would be no uae for
Legislatures? ;

a rule she will wait until force of circum
stances compels her to do it or a culmina
tion of events decides for her. This is tha
reason the average feminine Judgment is
so poorly developed. It is not used. How
can it grow when It is not exercised?
A man naturally decides promptly and
easily the self-same questions a woman
.worries over with endless questioning and
niisgivlngs. Therefore it is difficult for
mankind to understand the trouble wo
mankind experiences in "making up" the
mind. \u25a0
But there Is a reason for this ' difficulty.
So many considerations enter *fato the
matter from woman's standpoint, there la
really very little wonder she has such a
struggle.
As a rule, it Is not her judgment she
consults. It is her fears, her "impres
sions." . her superstitions, her intuitions,
her scruples, her friends and her friends*
friendsâ in short, anything or any one ex
cept herself. -
Women feel that they must look :to a
power outside of themselves for guidance
in making their decisions.
In the large decisions of life, how often
do we find women who fearlessly and res
olutely rely upen themselves? Do we not
find them rather going about to consult
astrologers, palmists, psychic readers and
seers and various orders? Do we not Â«cÂ«
them agonizing through long nights or
distressed meditation?
Man is not hampered by any such in
cumbrance. His judgment, stripped of
handicaps, runs a fr?e race straight to
the goaL
There Is no habtt more fatal to charac
ter than the habit of Indecision. It under
mines the very foundations of character.
'Judgment Is a mental muscle. It can
only be kept in good condition through
vigorous exercise. Our will was given" tr>
us to use. When we fall to use It In cul
tivating Judgment we enervate the will
and render our judgment flabby and use
less.
i, Woman, whatever you do, cultivate de
cisiveness. Learn to think quickly and
decide promptly In little things.
Better make . Innumerable mistakes In
trifling matters, at first, than permit your
self to become a slave to vacillation.
, Decide. What -tf . you do select a. hat
that Is not "Just wnat you want?" Wear
It and be bappy. This year's hat win not
matter next year, but this year's charac
ter will matter for all time.' Character
goes on forever.
Discipline ! yourself to "make up . your
mind" ; quickly. Put aside superstition
and . fear and , unreasonable worry. &a
sensible. Decide promptly, and . then
stick ;to your . decision. -

The experience of a hard-working 1
minister illustrates grave danjjers into
which coffee drinking leads the uncon-
scious victim.
Deranged nerves, clogged liver and
disturbed heart action are rarely at-
tributed by the sufferers to tlie right
cause, and the aid of powerful and dan-
gerous drug's is sought to give the re-
lief. Opium, in Its various forms, ia
;iie commonly used sedative, and with,
liie result, too frequently, that a.s the
use of the coffee is continued the ailment
proves worse and larger, and larger
coses of the drug: are demanded.
Then comes a day when the victim
realizes with horror thai he has be-
> ornes the slave of a terrible habit, the
mosi difficult to overcome of any
known to medical practice. Thousands
go to their graves every year because
<jf drug addictions, and the proportion
of those who recover ia very Email in-
deed, for to break the chain that binds
the sufferer a strength of will power is
required, of which the drug has already
robbed him.
Very lew, perhaps, ever deliberately
make choice of indulgence in hypnotic
drugs. In tbe majority of cases the
use is begun merely as a temporary
expedient, and with no thought of lta
continuance; but with each dose the
power to resist the appetite it creates
grows less. And those who do not un-
derstand the dangers, of coffee in-
dulgence are, because of that very
ignorance, the more easily led to the
verge of moral as well as physical ehip-
wreck. ' \ '
The clergyman referred to says that

A clergyman Is expected to i>reach
good sermons, and when 'be finds his in-
tellectual faculties have grown so
sluggish- that he .cannot properly pre-
pare himself it may be readily seen
that the temptation to use a- stimulat-
ing drug to overcome this inertia and
quicken his powers might prove fairly
irresistible. .' "
The time came to him when be real-
ized his dangerous condition. It must
be serious for a religious , teacher . to ;
drift into such a state; he states that
about that time be went through' the i
Postum factories at Battle Â£ Creek; and '
saw how ~Postum Coffee.' ie 5 made and j
when he went home he, determined to'
make, the struggle for "freedom. He
found it easy to rid himself of the cof-
fee habit at once, for Postum gave him
the hot. deilckros beverage he wanted
for breakfast' and no drug, but : rather j
the strong, rebuilding food elements.'
Thereupon . his â¢ natural sleep returned, i
.the pains in head disappeared and the
old lethargy left and " he says the
, growth tn hi* "vigor and strength has
tbeen nwst remarkable." A true and
happy return to natural conditions, and
perfect health. It's worth while.. Name i

808 FITZSIMJIOXS SHOWS .
SOME OF HIS. OLD-TIME FORM
Goes ThroHtfh a Lot of Training Work
In the Preience of Mnny Interested
\u25a0 . \u25a0 Spectator*. \u25a0 . : '
Fifteen roundsâ seven "of bagr punching
and eight of b"oxing with three sparring
mates â was the Indoor work done by 4 Bob
Fitzsimmons at his training quarters yes
terday at Croll's Gardens, Alameda. Five
hundred spectators, many of the 'gentler
sex, saw r*re<;kled Fitz wallop the swing
ing pig-skin and mix gloves with his op
ponents at top speed.' \u25a0 "When the ex
champion of pugdom and the only fighter
who wears a toupee reached the seventh
period in bag punching he yelled, "Look
out, O'Brien," and swung with the force
of a piledriver on the suspended sphere,
tearing it from its swivel and driving it
against the side of i his gymnasium with
knockout velocity. For this feat of
strength he was accorded rounds of ap
plause and greeted with cries of "Good
boy, Methuselah" and "Score one for the
old man." Fitz showed in his work, which
was strenuous from beginning to end,
that he is already in good condition.
Stephen Hughes, an amateur* heavy
weight, exchanged blows with the kan
garoo scrapper, and Fitz derived consid
erable amusement out of the bout with
the youngster. He then took on- Harry
Chester, a speedy Olympic Club-4 boxer,
for three rounds. Chester landed a glanc
ing swing on Ruby Robert's forehead,
which removed some cuticle from that
portion . of Fitz's turret and ( caused him
to look fierce. Billy Bates," the husky
and lively training mate of Fitzsimmons,
concluded the milling with a three-round
Inning. He bustled the lanky red fellow
around, but was unable to land with, any
effectiveness on slippery Bob.

Its all over now. The old talk about
two-baggers and bad decisions will be
discontinued until the magnates begin
to announce ihe opening day for the
*ea*t>n of 11>OS. The home team gen
erally gets away with the Â£rst and last
tranae of each season, but the winning
combination was torn in twain yes
terday. Seattle played good, baseball
and the Seals made a noise like a nock
of bushers, so thfere never was a doubt
after the first run was squeezed Over.
* Rube Vickers was the man to whom
tho'fans \u25a0 pflifl more attention tban to
any other reformers on the lot. They
were forced to bestow their gazes on
something out of -the ordinary because
nothin-gr else happened that wouM indi
cate a great baseball season was about
to be transformed into a mÂ»-re memory.
Â£)just to make It worth while the mul
titude sat and watche<S as the big Rube
winged Seal after Seal out till he finally
piled up ten scalps on his heap.
"i'he San Francisco layout could do
absolutely, nothing. Hits were seldom
seen r.r.d or.ly one walk interrupted the
fcwnotony. The northern fielders were
tfJfcSy and willing- to eat up every
tnins tl^-at happened to glide along the
prasÂ«y patch and they always made
pood. It's no wonder San Francisco
tnadf a tramp finish on the last day of
liie season. .
Williams was. not so much at fault
as his brothers for letting; seven of tbe
Biwashes arrive. True, he was hit at
times, but whenever he needed support
in a. tight' place there was nobody there
to handit out. Seattle started to land
in the first spaem.and every few in
nings they were sure to replenish their
supply of runs with one or more at a
time till the total of seven was ac
cumulated without any serious diffi
culty.
As a run-getter and a lively young
man on the sacks. Cliff Blankenship
made all ihe others look like a man with
out a home. He was up five times, tore
through with two hits that scored runs,
registered a pair, of . the tallies .himself
ami stole three bases. In -the, second
spasm. Blank, after bringing in a run j
with a Texas Leaguer to left, stole |
third and. paused there but a momeilt
before he tore into the plate while Wil
liams held the ball. The score:

Him for Winntns the Game.
LOS ANGELES, Dec. 3.â The baseball
season -.jf 1905 closed to-day with . a
double-header between \u25a0 Tacoma and
Los Angeles. The Angels ; took both
games, the first, an eleven-inning;
hard fought. Interesting contest, by the
score of 5 to 4, and the second, a bur r
lesque affair, by the Bcore of 8 to" 1.
Both fought hard for the- first -game,
and honors were even up to the last
minute, when Bobby Eagar's vhit
brought in the winning run. For his
timely hitting in tbe. ninth and elev
enth, when he both tied and won the
game, Eagar was showered with sllvei
from the grandstand and bleachers.
The second game, which went only
five innings, amused the crowd of 4000
as well as the players. , Mike Fisher
played first base. for the Tacomas and
Morley filled the. same position for the
locals. Fisher came to the bat but
once and got a single, -which, he main
tains, will place him at the head of the
league's batters for the season. Scores:

is without a- peer jon the coast, ; - but the
depends toO much r on himself and when

ond." Then, Just before the close' of ,the

and he played an excellent game. : , Once,
when Dirks f made ; a straight "\u25a0 kick % for

11. Long and Griffin and the
Gueriii Brothers Beach
the Finals at the Park
'A; -number of interesting tournament
tennis matches were played yesterday on
the. courts. In the mornias at tbe Cali
fornia Club Melville Long and George
Janes met in the finals . of . the first class.
Long caused quite a surprise by taking
the coast champion into camp. The score
was ft-4, 6-8. 6-3, ft-2. .. .. \u25a0' .
Long's victory was by no means a fluke;
as he has been coming to the front; rap*
.idly and has been' playing consistently of
late. He is a clever young player and
undoubtedly one of tbe most promising in
the city.
This is the third scratch singles tourna
ment Janes has played in since he won
the coast championship, and be bw been
beaten In all of. them..
Janes won only one set out of four, and
that he nearly lost. It was the only set
that was close. Long won the first set
by a score \>Z â¬-4. Fourteen games were
played in the second set and Janes Just
mamiged .to win out. . . . . . . '. ,â¢, â¢ _
In the third and fourth sets Long out
played his opponent all the way and won
pretty much as be pleased. Long was
steady, throughout and easily bandied the
champion's'' hard drives.. .
Until Long . won the last handicap tin
gles tournament at the California Club
about 1 a* month ago \u25a0 he was given ' little
consideration. .He will be hard to beat
from now on and by next summer should
be near the top of the list, i ...
Tbe handicap doubles tournament, at
tbe park -was completed to the nnata.
Herbert Long and Clarence Griffin and
tbe | Guerin brothers were the successful
teams. They will meet next Sunday.
Two matches were played in the third
round. In the first 31. Long and C. Foley
(owe 13 3-â¬) beat Feck and Yensano

In - the other match -H. Long and C.
Griffin (owe 12) beat F. Guerin and B.
Finnlgan (scratch),. &-3. 6-3. . \
In the semi-finals the Guerin brothers
(15) beat ' Fred Adams and George Janes
(owe 13 3-6) 'easily. The two champions
failed to win a set, the score being 6-3, 6-2.
The other semi-final : match, .was the
best of the day ' and proved fairly inter
esting. H. Long and Griffin were opposed
to M. . Long and Foley. The tatter were
called upon" to â¢give odds of owe 3-8. and
as a result the match was one-sided. If
tbe teams had met on even terms a closer
match would have resulted, but tbe out
come would not ha ye been changed. M.
Long was rather tired and Foley did not
play as well as usual. H. Long and Grif
fin were both in good form and they won
. without exerting themselves. The score
was â¬-%,' 6-3. * .
Long and â¢ Griffin will give the Guerin
brothers . Odds \u25a0of 15 and owe 15. If the
latter play as well as - they did , against
Adams and Janes they will come close to
winning.

MRS. HARRISON
LAID TO REST
Simple Service Marks Inter
ment in Crocker Tomb at
Cypress Lawn Cemetery
STOP AT SAN 31ATK0
Hosts of Loving Friends
Gather for a Few Minutes
in Old lvv-Covered Church
The body of Mrs. Kianeis Burion Har
rison was laid away in the Crocker tomb
at Cypress I^awn Cemetery yesterday aft
ernoon. Neither a great funeral service
nor the presence of a throng of people
marked the burial of this beloved young
California woman, whose life was sud
denly ended in an automobile wreck in
New York eight days ago.
A little group of her closest friends and
relatives marched slowly behind the
flower-covered casket and watched the
interment in the tomb. Their sadness
was expressed in the simplicity of the
service, a simplicity which had marked
the character of the woman whose body
they were following to its last- resting
place on earth.
The funeral train arrived in San Mateo
late In the afternoon. A public service
was held in St. Matthew's Episcopal
Church, so that the many friends of
Mary Crocker, the name by which they
hafi always known her, might be given
an opportunity to show the tender love
which they felt for her. Then the train
hurried on to Cypress Lawn, where the
relatives and a few of the closest friends
of the dead woman gathered privately for
a loving prayer. When the intetment
wit over these friends were taken back
to their homes.
The services at San Mateo were deeply
impressive. Down in the little ivy-covered
church where, a* a girl, Mary Crocker
had worshiped a crowd of her old frlendis
were gathered. It was the little church
which had been the Inspiration for Mary
Crocker to do so many good deeds of
kindness among the poor of the surround
ing country. Beautiful flowers filled the
chancel, the gifts Of her friends.
There was a solemn little procession
frem the train to the church. In the
first carriages were the members of the
party which had accompanied the body
from New Yorkâ the bereft husband, Mr.
Rnd Mrs. Alexander, Mr. and Mrs. Lau
rance Scott, Mr. and Mrs. Charles T.
Crocker and Miss Jennie Crocker. Then
<ame the coffin, and behind it the pall
bearersâHenry T. Scott, Charles Green,
Walter Martin, E. W. Howard, John
Lawson and Harry Scott.
Rector N. B. W. Gallwey read the EpJs
c-opal service within the church. The
choir of childish voices sang" "Abide With
Me." There "was a recitation of the
psalter and the reading of the resurrec
tion chapter from. Corinthians. Right
Rev. William Ford Nichols assisted in
the service.
The coffin rested in the center of the
chancel. Over it wae a pall of vio
lets. The intimate friends and the mem
bers of the family sat In the front part
of the church, while, back of them were
seated the general public.
The service at Cypress Lawn was com
pleted about 5:30 o'clock in the afternoon.
A carpet of greens and white roses had
been laid from the gate of the cemetery
to the entrance of the tomb. Along this
the funeral procession marched. A tent
was erected In front of the tomb to In
sure the privacy of this final service.

TEMBLOR STIRS
UP EXCITEMENT
\u25a0 â¢ Â»
Short but Severe Earthquake
Visits the Gity Shortly
Before the Hour of Xoon
Shortly before the noon hour yes
terday a. short but very severe earth
quake shock was felt In this city and
the towns across the bay. Luckily no
great damage resulted here, though
windows were broken lin various parts
of town and the excitement that at
tended the visit of the temblor was
general.
According to the seismograph at the
Chabot Observatory, Oakland, the
shock occurred at precisely 11:25:58
o'clock and lasted just three seconds.
The Instrument recorded the direction
of the shock from southwest to north
east. From all accounts the" shock
felt across the bay was not to be com
pared with the severe shock experi
enced here. \u25a0 .â¢'â¢?! .
A peculiar feature of the earthquake
was the severe damage it did' to the
large and expensive plate glass, win
dows in the Jewelry store of Radke..&
Co. on, Sutter. street, near Kearny. with
out harming any other property in the
Immediate vicinity. The windows ." of
the Jewelry store were entirely shat
tered, but " fortunately no passersby
were in the neighborhood' at the time.
Out - In the.' -Westera -Addition the
shock caused much excitement and
fear. It was so sharp and decisive as
to cause a rumbling sound and make
the timbers of many houses groan and
creak. More shbeks were expected at
any moment, as the temblors generally
come in' bunches, but the others, failed
to materialize, a fact which caused
general satisfaction in the ' residence
portions of the city where; many, fam
ilies were seated*around the. table par
taking of their midday meals. ', i!-isill
