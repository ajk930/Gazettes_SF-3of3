NAPER. Nebr., May 4.â In a battle
lasting all' day yesterday the Sheritta
of four Northern Nebraska count i-Â»
captured the three Kerring brothers,
desperadoes and alleged bank robbers,
after wounding two of the Kerrlngs.
One of the" posse was badly wounded.
â¢The Kerrlngs had taken refuge In a
fortified stone house on the .edge of
the Sioux reservation, and from this
point. of vantage held off the officers
with "Winchesters.
For the ; past two years numerous
bank robberies and other thefts have
occurred In f Northern Nebraska. All
efforts to' capture the thieves were un
availing." Two weeks ago the bank at
this, place .was -dynamited and every
cent of cash taken. Suspicion pointer!
to ; the Kerrlngs. Posses were f orm? J.
which "Included the Sheriffs from four
counties, and search was made for the
suspected men.'
It was discovered that the Kerringa
had , left ..their own. homes and had
taken refuge In a stone house, which
they had built for the purpose. Yes
terday morning at daylight the place
was surrounded and a demand for sur
render made to one of the Kerrings,
who was on guard. He answered with
a shot from his Winchester and his
brothers, from within the house, joinÂ»d
in the shooting, which became general.
One of the deputies was seriously
wounded early In the fight. and after
ward ..two- officers were slightly
wounded.
5 After dark last night the deputies
ceased firing for several hours, when
the Kerrlngs. supposing they had with
drawn;'made a dash and attempted to
escape. In the fight which followed
two of them were badly wounded and
the third surrendered.
All three were brought to this place
in irons ; and are in Jail. Threata 6i

The great building: was a bower, of

Seated In the auditorium proper were
74S representatives of Methodism.gath
ered from the four quarters of the

good of a common cause and eager to

Seated upon the stage were the Gover

to extend a welcome in" behalf of the
State, the city and the church. In the

This evening at 8 o'clock the recep

dresses of welcome by representatives
of the State, city and the church in
Southern California and responses by
eminent leaders in Methodism made
up the programme, which kept the tired
and travel-worn delegates occupied un
til a late hour. >. c l
No progress was made at. the morn

of delegates to seats and the calling
of the roll, which developed the lack
of' a "quorum because many delegates
who came direct from the railroad sta

securing their seats in order to look up
their hotel quarters. .

not been expected by either the At

At the Southern California Hospital,
as at the other State hospitals for the
insane, relatives - of patients who are
able to pay for their maintenance are
charged $15 per month. This money, is
collected by the secretary and turned
over to the medical superintendent' of
the hospital, who in turn renders an
account each month to the lunacy com
mission. Soon after Pardee was. ap
pointed secretary/of the . commission
he set to work to ascertain what sum
of money was due the State from this
source. He found that there was $31,
000 due from" all the hospitals combined
and that, while the Southern California
Hospital harbored only 800 of the total
5000 patients under the State's care,
there was. due that institution ,415,000
from pay patients,' or almost half the
aggregate indebtedness.
Pardee visited the hospital and, se
curing data, returned' to Sacramento
and wrote to the relatives of the South
ern California pay patients, inquiring
as to; the amounts they had paid in
and as to the date on which, they were
paid and "reqtiesting. them to send him
their receipts. .He' learned from these
receipts i . that' some had paid much
more than they had been credited with
on Clark's books.' .Of the forty persons
who responded' the 'accounts only of
two corresponded with the books of
Secretary Clark: Pardee estimated
that, Clark's shortage was $3000. It
was 'ascertained that he had Juggled
his accounts , in such a way. that one
party > would receive credit : for money
paid-in by another and that In some in
stances he ; had waited two years be
fore he '.reported payments made to
him.' Clark had*. been secretary of thÂ«i
hospital for seven years, i It is believed
here that Superintendent M. B. Camp
bell will ; be responsible to the State' for
Clark's defalcation, as the law does riot
impose any responsibility upon ttie'sec
retary, whose duties Â¦ are Â¦ regarded as
Clark was a prominent Elk, having
served as secretary of the jj Redlands
Lodge for three successive terms. For
some time it. has been rumored that
Clark was to lose his position at the
hospital and some attribute that as the
causÂ« for his suicide. He was connect
ed with the scandal which shook. the
asylum several months ago and which
is thought to have preyed ' upon the
mind of his associate, Dr. A. Stanley
Dolan, who committed suicide in River
side last April.
SACRAMENTO, May 4.â The an
nouncement that A. C. Clark, secre
tary to the medical superintendent of
the Southern California Hospital for
the Insane, had committed suicide, was
contained in a dispatch received at the
Capitol late this afternoon from C. L
Pardee and Charles Waymire of the
commission in lunacy, asking for in
structions as to their future actions.
Secretary Pardee of the 'lunacy com
mission, accompanied by Waymfre. left
Sacramento- yesterday, for the. purpose
of continuing an investigation he had
begun some time ago into the 'affairs
of Clark. Pardee had discovered gross
irregularities,, in. Clark's accounts and
it was the intention that he and/Way
mire should appear at a meeting of
the board of managers, next Monday
and in the presence of Clark accuse
him of having embezzled about $3000
in money belonging to the State.

COTTAGE GROVE, Or., May 4. â
Trailing behind his father and re
luctant to go to school this morning,
Roy Damewood, the 9-year-old son of
J. E. Damewood, a rancher of this
county, nearly fell a victim to a fam
ished cougar. Damewood started on
ithe seventeen-mile walk from his
ranch on, the Bohemia stage road to
this place early this morning. His tw*>
boys accompanied him. Intending to
Eolaa farVas :the; schoolhouse. Roy
brought up. the rear on a trail through
a bit of grown up clearing and hi3
father turned to bid him hurry along.
As he turned 1 Damewood saw a large
cougar crouched to spring. The man
rushed to his boy's rescue, shouting
to Roy to run. The breast sprang for
ward but fell short, and before it
could gather itself together the
rancher kicked it vigorously, so vigor
ously, in fact, that the beast fled.
Damewood then chased the cougar
into a tree and sent the boys home for
his gun. A shot in the skull brought
down a mere bag of bones, for the
animal had evidently long lacked for
a meal.

News of. Enormous Losses Arouses
Grief in Russian Capital.
ST. PETERSBURG, May 5. 3:47 a.
m. â The Russian losses at -the battle
of Kiulienchehg were 2000 men'. and
forty officersâ far greater r than pre
viously reported. ';;-.'i,^'V
This is the official estimate oÂ£ Major
General Kashtalinsky. who directly
commanded the division that suffered
the brunt of the attack and whose re
port was received yesterday by the
Emperor. Many aro- inclined to place
the Russian losses even higher. Gen
eral Kashtalinsky mentions also that
more than 700 wounded had arrived at
Fengwangcheng and these may- not be
included In his calculations. He made
no attempt to estimate the Japanese
losses, merely stating that they must
have been colossal. .
The magnitude of the Russian losses
had an almost stunning effect upon the
authorities and aroused general grief,;
mitigated only by satisfaction Â¦, "at the
bravery displayed by . the Russian
troops. (
Not for a moment was there any in-
tention to pay such a terrible price for
delaying the ! enemy's crossing of the
Yalu. This fact was known throughout
the city and gave ri^ to renewed re
ports, attributed to /official -sources,,
that General Kuropatkin had officially
censured Lieutenant General Zassu
litch. If this was so, General Kuro
patkih's telegraphed criticism of Zas
sulitch was carefully cut out of the
dispatches which have been published,
and the general/ impression now held
is that he will remain in Manchuria.
General Kaahtalinsky's report estab
lishes the fact that the Russians sus
tained the greatest loss in order- to
6a ve the two regiments which were
occupying Antung.
"The Eleventh -Regiment was. given
the post of honor at. the rear, with in
structions to hold back the oncoming
Japanese. The Twelfth Regiment and
the Third Battery's quick-firing de
tachment were directed to retire.
By the time the latter movement
commenced the Japanese had almost
surrounded the .Russian position. The
Twelfth Regiment; was compelled to
charge with the bayonet and .succeed-;
ed in. .breaking, through the. enemy's
lines.. T.he Second Battery's quick-firing
detachment, without horses, could not
move the guns and was compelled to
abandon thfem. The men of the Second
Battery put 1 their shoulders ~ to the
.wheeii/in' art effort to* push ' the guns
up the mountain side, but the 'Japanese
fire was ,so hot that they returned to
the protection of the Eleventh Regi
ment.. â¢:' â¢ . ' -Â¦ '
Nearer and nearer approached the
Japanese and a charge upon the Elev
enth Regiment and the Second Battery
was imminent, so the guns were aban
doned.
Then a priest led the troops and they
began the terrible march across, the
valley.
"kuliencheng Is history and we must
now deal "with impending events," said
an officer of the general staff today.
The idea has prevailed that the Rus
sians would not make a stand at Feng
wangcheng.'but the fact that a Japan
ese occupation oÂ£ that point Â¦would en
able a. movement to .the southwest,
thus cutting off the Liaotung penin
sula, which is taken Into consideration
by the authorities, leads to the expec
tation' that General Kuropatkin .will
dispatch' strong_ reinforcements there,
and make a determined stand.
The activity of the Japanese, It is
; liONDON, May 5.â It is said the Jap
anese have ."advanced to within elgh
.teeniiniles of Fengwangcheng and that
another engagement is expected almost
immediately. , - : , Â¦ .
Major General Kashtalinsky 's insist
ence on the fact that he waa. ordered
to accept battle by Lieutenant General
Zassulitch is interpreted as showing his
Intention -to- throw -the responsibility
upon.- that officer for risking-a fight
with his 1 inferior forces and to confirm
the reports that General Zassulitch had
been censured. . -
I Reports have been received here that
the' Japanese captured a- quantity of
railroad material after Sunday's bat
tle.; .This is supposed to' indicate that
the 'Russians had made great progress
With. the railroad from the main Man
churian line to the Yalu. If this is so
It. would" be a simple matter for the
Japanese "to repair .line, which
would materially assist, them in their
advance through a difficult country.
I English correspondents with the Jap
anese forces on the Yalu are permitted
to send the most ample descriptions
of the people and the country travers
ed, but not a word about the fighting.
', The Standard's Tientsin correspond
ent says he is convinced that the Rus
sian position in Southern Manchuria is
Exceedingly weak, as a consequence of
the enormous number of men detached
to guard the railway and to obtain pro
visions. He believes that the forces
at Haicheng and Liaocheng are greatly
overestimated. The camps, he says,
are numerous, but there are few men
in them. There are several fortifica
tions in the hills between Fengwang
cheng and Haicheng, but the line, of
communication is weak and straggling.

ST. LOUIS, May 4.â With the open
ing day of the World's Fair well behind
them,, the Callfornians, with the thou
sands of other exhibitors, are still busi
ly employed in making a fair. Califor
nia is among the few States that are
nearly ready to say "completed."
Though the variety of her display is
marvelous and her space next to the
largest in the agricultural building
where the most is*shown by the differ
ent States, she has kept abreast of the
leaders through the zealous efforts of
the various county commissioners.
â¢ Getting goods delivered, even from
. Â¦ th$ biggest firms, has been very diffi
i cult. It will probably .be less so now
. ' that better weather has come and the
[ roads out toward the fair and the en
; trances to the grounds are not gluey
; bogs. One order sent out at 11 in the
. | morning reached its destination in the
. | 7 California section at 6:30. Alameda
, and Contra Costa had to wait a week
. ; for glass for their cases and Kings and
. ' Fresno made a display on the opening
, day without the burlap covering .on
I their building because they couldn't get
; the material in the first place 'and
couldn't get it tacked on in time when
they did get it.
Despite all they have been through,
though, and what they have yet to con
Â¦ tend with,' the Californlans are happy.
1 They are pleased at the< sptsndid dis
play their State is making Â«ji4 the fig
j ure she will cut at the fair.
; i Though the Sacramento Development
I Association will not be ready with its
1 display for two weeks yet, the change \
Â¦â¢ in the plans of its structure will prove ;
! beneficial and when the show is com
fpleted it will be something that the
whole State may be proud of. Espe
cial State interest hangs about this ex
hibit, as it represents the region con
taining the capital of the State and
j strangers are prone to look. to the re
' gion containing the capital as being
representative. The central structure
of the display has been elaborated so
as to represent the State House in the
city of Sacramento." It will be 46 feet
I high and a flag staff at the top will
I bear the name "Sacramento Valley."
! The new contract has been let and the
building has been commenced. It will
be put up "all at once," something af
ter the fashion of a modern sky scrap
er, nearly all of it being constructed
in sections outside the fair grounds.
CALIFOKXIAXS ARE ILL.
Dr. Green, who has been here with
Judge Wills representing the develop
ment association. Is Just getting around
again after a severe illness. Nearly
every member of the California colony
has been s'.ck at seme time since ar
rival here, owing to the change of cli
mate. Most of the county commis
j sioners live at the -Blue Grass Hotel
! at 4040 Olive street, not a. great dis
tance from the fairgrounds: They are
on a street car line that will afford -no
accommodations later on . for anything
larger than a fly after the cars leave
the downtown section.
Full grown trees are springing up in
a day about the California building and
the walks are being graveled and the '
grounds sodded. realistic represent
ation of 'a: mission 'Â¦- structure in its
grove of "olives and oranges will soon
be.nresented.
The warmer weather is very gratify
ing to the Filipinos, who have seen .
their first blizzard and are not^ desir
ous of taking one home with them. The. '>
festive spirit that filled these â¢ new
American broth s on their trip': here
from San , Francisco has been some

GOODS DELIVERED SLOWLY.
j cents an hour and ordinary labor for
23 cents.
Labor generally is not making ex
cessive demands In the way of wages,
however., considering It is exposition
time and prices are high. The Califor
nians are getting carpenters for 65
San Francisco has some unions, but
the World's Fair makes a special and
complete display in this line. Every
man who tacks on a piece of burlap,
unpacks some prunes or lifts a case
belongs to some sort of a uniqn and
any discourtesy shown is likely to tie
up a whole building. Strikes are de
j clared somewhere every fifteen minutes
and unless a prompt adjustment 'is
made there are chances that every
hired man except the Jefferson Guards
â the exposition policeâwill be resting.
It is said there is a movement on foot
by the unions to charge double time
for all strikes. It is thought that this
will make the employers less pompous
and tend to promote harmony.
The Riverside county commissioner
wanted some cheese cloth lining tacked j
up in the irrigation booth. This work
was ordinarily worth $7 including the
lining. The decorators demanded $75.
The commissioner said he would do
the work himself, but he couldn't show
any card better than a laundry- ticket.
Pretty soon the work of grading the
Exposition grounds stopped and a tie
up of the' St. Louis street car system
was threatened. Before the trouble
could get beyond the borders of the
State a detective was put on the track
and its source was traced to the River
side booth. The commissioner agreed
to* pay. the $75 â and the world began to
revolve again.
There is enough shown by California
how to dazzle the visitor, but May 15
will probably see a completed display
and this will equal any record made in
the agricultural building. Of course
this prediction is made in the belief
that contractors will be catching up
with their work from now on and that
skilled labor will be more easily ob
tained. It doesn't take long to put
even an- elaborate display in place if
conditions are half favorable.
* Night work would have helped mat
ters along and probably resulted in the
counties that were behind being en
tirely ready on tne first, but no lights
have been Drovided in the agricultural
building.
LABOR DIFFICULTIES.
| It is not the fault of any county com
missioner that his display is not ready.
When each arrived here and surveyed
his space he said to himself: "My con
j stituents will be pleased to learn that
j their display was all ready when the
j curtain was rung up." Then he began
j to fall against contractors who were
full of promise and a month behind
with their work; labor unions that
gathered up their doll rags at the
slightest breach of etiquette 'and be
sides these a bunch of pirates in gen
eral that felt assured their last chance
j on earth of getting rich lay in the Loui
siana Purchase Exposition. As a con
sequence, when the opening day came
those of the commissioners who had
figured on enough time only to erect
four such displays as they had in hand,
were somewhat behind.

time to' leave their desks since their

have to earn a good deal more than
their salaries during the remainder of

California's unusual and extensive
method of representation by counties
is creating some friction at the pass de
partment of the exposition, the busiest
of the fair just at present. Many per
sons connected with county commis
sions, but who are not actually In
charge of any exhibit here, are expect
ing passes and have had applications
made for them. It Is felt by the ap
plicants that because of California's
expensive display those who helped
provide it should be treated liberally
in the matterjof passes. .
ATTACH ES OVERWORKED.
There is not much of an influx of
Callfornlans to date. The hotel regis
ters show but few arrivals from the

here' are largely those who have expo

Chinese claiming American nativitiy.
6617 were males and 2363 females.
The Director expressed the conviction
that the preponderance of males is

SANTA CRUZ, May 4. â The will of
Murdock Young, who died here in
April. 1903, leaving an estate valued at
513,000, to be distributed among his
friends, has been sustained. In the
will he declared tha* he had never

learned that fifty years ago he left a

The court held that Young's failure to
mention his children was intentional
and not an oversight.

OGDEN, Utah, May 4.â No trace has
yet been discovered of Charles Lennox,
the escaped murderer and the Butte
deputy sheriff who disappeared from
an incoming passenger train yesterday.
Sheriff. Quinn and police officers and
sheriffs are engaged in a close search
of the surrounding country. Early this
morning a stranger was seen in a be
draggled condition about five miles
north of this city, but he disappeared
before the ofllcers could be notified. The
officers believe now that the murderer
killed the deputy sheriff .after leaving
the train, threw the body into the Og
den River andHhen escaped.
Lennox was in charge of Deputy
Sheriff Miller of Silver Bow County. â¢
Last night , about 10 o'clock a man
showed up at a sal#on in the northern
part of the city covered with mud and
water, as if he might have been in
the river. He was alone and offered
no explanation, but left the place in a
few -minutes..

waited he/e for the murder of Charles
Wimams, a Butte, A'naconda and Pa
cific, freight conductor, at Silver Bow
Junction, this county, in May. 1902.
Lennox was found guilty and con
demned to death. In August 1903, he
broke jail with six others, including
his accomplice. Jame3 Martin. Martin
was recaptured and hanged /here last
February. Â» Should Lennox be recap
tured he will be hanged at once, as
when he broke jail the Supreme Court
abrogated his right of appeal.

also a demonstrated fact that Newbro's
Herpicide kills the dandruff germ. With-
out dandruff falling hair would stop, and
thin hair will thicken. Herpicide not only
kills the dandruff germ, but it also makes
hair as soft as silk. It is the most de-
lightful hair dressing made. It cleanses
the scalp from dandruff and keeps it
clean and healthy. Itching and irrita-

Denounces the Democrats
DENVER, Mny 4. â Senator Thomas
M. Patterson addressed an audience of
5000 people in Coliseum Hal! to-night
on "Local Issues From a Democratic
Standpoint." The speech was an as
sault upon the local Democratic ticket,
which will be voted upon at the city

son has repudiated the ticket, charg
ing that the Mayoralty candidate,
Robert Speer, is the agent of the cor
porations and that the ticket itself
from top to bottom Is not Democratic,
but "Speer."
The Senator inveighed against elec

made the name of Denver "infamous,"
and for which he charged Robert W.
Speer to be responsible as the "local
Democratic boss." Senator Patterson

Gold Standard Rejected.
PANAMA, May 4. â The proposal
before the Assembly that Panama
should adopt the United States gold
standard was rejected, after an ex
cited discussion, by. 16 votes to 13.
The Government, arid the opposition
parties did not act as units.'
United States District Attorney Mar
shall B. Wood worth* was then called for
a few questions on the lines of those
asked Slack and Samuels. He said he
had nothing to do with the letter to
Schneider and had not. talked with
either of them about it,, but he. had
sent Slack to Washington just as he
had sent the other Government wit
nesses from San Francisco, without
telling them anything of the progress
of the. investigation. ... V . .. - k ..-â¢â¢..
When, the 'day closed Dimond's coun
sel had made no apparent progress, in
"I object to this volunteer statement
from Mr. Hyde," interrupted Knight.
"If he wants to testify let him be
sworn and take the stand. He has re
fused to do this. Hence we. do not
want his unsworn statements to go
on the record."
"Objection sustained," ruled Com
missioner Heacock.
Samuels manifested a disposition to
make a speech in answer to every
question, and finally denounced Knight
and Wheeler for "instigating the sus
picion" that he or Slack had any con
nection with the letters. The examina
tion was at last, concluded, however,
ajid he left the stand.
All these denials were in answer to
Knight'* questions designed to dis
cover the author of the anonymous
communications. Still others were ob
tained from the witness when he de
clared he had none but the friendliest
feeling toward Hyde and had, never
written or countenanced the writing of
an anonymous letter to or against him
or to or against any one else. Finally
he denied having any knowledge j that
would implicate Mrs. Belle Curtis'with
the new celebrated epistles. This
brought another emphatic utterance
from Hyde.
"Mrs. Curtis did not write any of
the anonymous letters. She could not
have done so. She had no knowledge
of facts contained in them andâ"
CLKAKS .MRS. CURTIS.
At this point Hyde himself requested
and obtained permission to make', a
statement.
"In Justice to Miss Farwell, who is
now dead." he said. "I want to say
that I never charged her with writing
such a letter or even suspected that
she could have any connection with it.
Neither did any one else who knew
her."
Samuels declared he had not been
in San Jose or its vicinity since 1902,
and repeated with emphasis that he
had not mailed the Town Talk letter
or any other of the* anonymous com
munications. He had^never used *a
Blickensderfer typewriter, the only" one
he had ever seen being the one owned
by Dimond. Â¦ â¢ â¢
"On hearing this," said Samuels, "I
advised my client. Slack, to write
Schneider to keep nothing back
through consideration for him. The
k-tter was drafted by me arid Slack
copied it. In it Slack said that he had
no objection to Schneider's communi
cating anything he knew about the
writer to any person or under any cir
cumstances whatever. The letter was
given to Burns, but before it was de
livered Schneider had fled to Mexico."
Samuels was asked by Knight wheth
er Hyde had ever spoken to him re
garding: any anonymous letters he had
received. The witness said the subject
had been mentioned once, Hyde speak
ing of an unsigned letter attacking him
personally and having no reference to
the land business. The only person
mentionedMn connection with the letter
was Miss Laura Farwell. Hyde had
tcld the witness that some one had
tried to connect her indirectly with the
anonymous letter referred to, but that
he knew she had nothing to do with so
disreputable a matter. ,
latter had refused to tell what he knew
about the Hyde-Benson land opera
tions, giving as a reason that he di<>
not want to incriminate his friend
Slack.
SLACK* HAD NOTHING TO FKAR.
OMAHA, May 4.â Members of the
Democratic Success League, recently
organized here, say they are convinced
that it is Bryan's purpose to leave the
national convention If he cannot have
what he wants.
"Within a month," said one of the
members of the league to r day, "J. F.
Harley of Lincoln told Mr. Bryan he
would like to be a delegate to the St.
Louis convention. He explained his
position on publics questions and prom
ised Bryan he would back him in
everything he wanted."
"Will you stay with me in a bolt if
it should come to that?" asked JJryan,
and Harley replied that he would not.
A few days later Tom Worrall,
Bryan's right-hand man, called on
Harley and told him that he could not
possibly be a delegate to St. Louis,
giving- as his reason Harley's refusal
to bolt if necessary. Members of the
Success League assert that they are
not fighting Bryan. Their chief con
cern is to see 'that a delegation repre
sents Nebraska that will not bolt. They
expect to see Bryan lead a movement
out of the hall if things do not go his
way and say that if the Nebraska dele
gation goes with him it will be a hu
miliating blow to the Democracy of the
State. Within a few days the names
of delegates whom they will fight for
at the primaries will be announced by
the league. The fight will be made on
the personalities of the candidates and
there will be no attempt to make
Bryan an issue. W. H. Thompson of
Grand Island, candidate for Governor
two years ago, and now candidate for
national committeeman, came to Oma
ha to-day in an endeavor to pacify the
Bryan and anti-Bryan wings of the
party. This mission did not meet with
any success and the fight will be car
ried to the polls on May 25.
EpecUl Dispatch to The Call.
The monotony of a dull day In the
land fraud case was broken yesterday
afternoon when Francis J. Heney,
counsel for the Government, read in
evidence a series of letters between
Defendants Henry P. Dimond and
Fred A. Hyde, showing that the for
mer had full knowledge of the Califor
nia school land laws when he was try
- ing to get the General Land Office at
Washington to remove the bar put up
on the Hrde ami Benson lieu selec
tions.
Throughout his testimony Dimond
has Insisted that he had no part or lot
in Hyde's irregular method of obtain
ing State school lands by employing
the friends of his colored Janitor and
other Irresponsible persons at a nom
inal consideration to sign affidavits
setting forth that they were applicants
In rood faith for such lands for their
Â¦own sole use and benefit. Hyde had
admitted to him in the famous letter
of January 16, 1902, that such methods
had been employed, but he had not
understood that they were contrary to
law.' He testified further that he had
never read the sections of the Political
Code requiring applicants for school
lands to make their* descriptive affi
davits from personal knowledge of the
lands sought to be "located." The let
ters that Heney introduced yesterday,
however, made it plain that these sec
tions wer^ the subject of frequent cor
refpondence between Dimond and the
land speculator. Under Heney's cross
â¢ examination it came out that Dimond
hÂ»d a copy of the code at hand when In
Washington, and that he had, at
Hyde's suggestion, written the Interior
Department calling attention to the
utrict requirements of the school land
sections as furnishing presumptive
evidence that the Hyde-Benson titles
offered to the Government were valid.
HYDE'S LAXD TITLES.
~*The day's work was largely with
documents. Heney put in a great
number, of letters from Hyde
lo Dimond and vice versa, covering
not only the matter of Dimond's
knowledge of the California code, but
also his acquaintance with the fact
i.hat he was acting, while at Washing
ton, for both Hyde and Benson. Then
Bert Schl**smjTer, of Hyde's counsel, of
fered in evidence the patents, certifi
cates of purchase and deeds held by his
client to all the California and Oregon
school lands for which d^eds of relln
quishment had been given by him to
the Goverrment to obtain the lieu sec
tions. This mass of documents covered
all the thirty-four counts in the indict
ment, and the reading of the briefest
descriptions of them took Schlesinger
nearly an hour.
It is the defects in the titles based
upon these' documents that the prose
cution alleges an support of its charge
that tho defendants conspired to sub
stitute fraudulent titles to State land^
{or unassailable title obtained from the
Government. Hence it was notleed
with interest that among the grantors
named in the deeds appeared the nams
<<t the fictitious Elizabeth Dimond.
whom Hyde at first claimed was a ser
vant in the Morris household at East
Oakland, but who is now conceded to
have been a myth. The transactions in
her name, including the affidavits and
acknowledgments purporting to have
been executed by her, constitute a ma-
Trial iiart of the Government's case
against the alleged conspirators.
Leon Samuels was recalled on the
opening of court in the morning and
Questioned further by Samuel Knight
of Dimond's counsel regarding his re
lations with Hyde an'd Walter K. Slack,
who, like Samuels, was formerly a
cierk in Hyde's office. He testified that
the letter to Defendant Joost H.
Schneider at Tucson, which he had
crafted for S!ack to sign, was written
at the suggestion of Detective Burns.

tending entirely across the front of th*.
broad stage and beneath these a beau

reached the floor. Around the railing
of the galleries, with flags and bunting
for a background, the same scheme of
decoration had been carried out, the
while forming a â¢ perfect bower of
bloom, beneath which the delegates sat.
The ceiling"* had been hung with im

from the center to the galleries and
giving the appearance of a great sun

Bishop Merrill called the conference
to order in a formal manner and open
ed the day with a brief prayer.' Rev.
D. S. Monroe, D. D., secretary of the
conference, called the roll of delegates.
The entire morning session was given
up to the assignment of seats to the
various delegations.
Owing to the fact that it was impos
sible to secure any degree of quiet and
composure among the delegates and
spectators, the speeches of welcome by
the Governor, the Mayor and represen

of the programme, having originally
been planned for the opening feature,
was postponed until evening.
Dimond's Writing to Hyde
Bead in Land Fraud Hear
ing to Contradict Him
The subject of the deaconess* work,
which was brought before the confer
ence on a motion by Rev. Mr. Brush
ingham of the Rock River Conference,
stirred up a lively debate' that occu
pied more than an hour. Rev. Mr.
Brushingham's motion was for a com
mittee on deaconess' wurk, composed
of fifty members, one-half ministers
and one-half laymen, three to bo. ap
pointed by each of the fourteen district
conferences, and the remainder by the
Bfshdps. Â¦ This was amended by Rev.
Dr. Hughes of St. Louis so as to give
the Bishops power to appoint the en
tire membership of the committee.
The debate that followed was lively,
Dr. Arder of Ohio, Dr. Boyle of Pitts
burg and Dr. Thomas B. Neeley of
New York arguing against giving the
Bishops the appointive power, while
Dr. W. H. Wilder of Illinois* argued
"I want to say," said Dr. Buckley,
pausing for a moment after the flash,
"that\he man who did that may be a
photographer, "but he Is ignorant of
human nature. I trust that those in
charge of this. hall will not again per
mit such nerve-racking acts as that
without due notice to those present."
,"1 shall ask,", said Bishop Andrews,
"that the superintendent of the build
ing and the officers of the law pro
tect us from another such shock."
Dr. -Buckley's t resblutlons- were
adopted unanimously and a copy or
dered presented to the retiring secre
tary.
Nominations for General Conference
secretary being in order, the following
names were placed before the confer

Dr. James B. Hingeley of Minnesota;
Dr. Stephen O. Benton of the New
England Conference; Dr. E. M. Mills,
Dr. C. C. Townsend of the Northern
New York Conference and Dr. E. W.

Dr. James M. Buckley of New York

At Hearst headquarters In the Grand
Hotel it Is estimated that not more
than 100 of the 723 delegates to the
Democratic State convention at Santa
Cruz will oppose the resolution in
structing the California delegation to
support Hearst in the National Con
vention. The estimate i* based on the
result of Tuesday's election in the
cities where the primary election la\v
is mandatory, and on the returns of
appointment made by county com
mittees in localities where the primary
law is not compulsory. In several
counties, meetings to elect or appoint
delegates will be held next Saturday.
The California delegation to tha
Democratic National Convention will
consist of twenty memDers, four at
large and two from each Congres
sional district. There is nothing, how
ever, in the case of the national com
mittee to compel the recognition of
Congressional districts In the selection
of delegates. The entire delegation
may be taken from one county or one
Congressional district, but of course
locality will be recognized cm the broad
ground of common fairness.
No one Is yet slated or widely men

ADDRESS BY GOVERNOR.
Dr. W. F. McDowell of Ohio moved
the. appointment of a judiciary com
mittee, which, he asserted, was very
much needed by the general conference
to consider the many questions of law
that constantly arose. He wished this
committee to be composed of one mem
ber from each district conference and
three at large, to be named by the
Bishops and confirmed by the General
Conference. The resolution prevailed
and the firgt matter that . will come
before the judiciary committee when
it shall have been chosen is the subject
of a standing provision for superannu
ated Methodist ministers.
The Episcopal address was made a
special order for to-morrow morning at

retirement of six years to do it, and
others appealed to their party in vain
against instructing.
The Hearst people would listen to no
compromise, and Wade and Sullivan
do not appear on the delegation. It is
headed by J. M. Parsons of Rock
Rapids, the other delegates at large
being General James B. Weaver of
Coif ax, Judge William' Carr of Man
chester and S. H. Wadsworth of Coun
cil Bluffs.
Cries of "bought," "brass collar,"
"how much did it cost?" met the Hearst
speakers whenever they attempted to
speak and pandemonium reigned in the
convention.
The resolutions adopted were mild.
They include a paragraph touching
the evils of taxation, etc., and lay
greatest stress on the trusts, and point
to William R. Hearst as the champion
of the anti-trust Idea. The trust para
graph is as follows:
"Second âThat we recognize in the
predatory trusts the greatest danger
that has ever threatened the life of the
nation and the welfare of the people,
and denounce their scheme of levying
tribute upon all producers and con
sumers as a modern system of
brigandage which, while masquerading
under the cloak of the law, in fact
makes of law a mockery and justice a
farce. In utter disregard of the natural
and constitutional rights of the farmer,
the merchant and the great army of
wage earners, trusts have ruthlessly
seized upon every branch of production
and distribution until every avenue of
human endeavor is compelled to be at
the behests of these conscienceless
criminals and pay tribute or cease to
exist.
"ThirdâThat we denounce the vicious
tariff,system fostered and.perpetuated
by the Republican party under which
the trusts have been, born, bred, fat
tened and multiplied "until they
have every industrial interest by the
throat, and we demand the repeal of
every tariff which denies 'equal oppor
tunities for all. 4?"

STANFORD. UNIVERSITY, May 4.
At the last university assembly of the
year, held this morning, John Mc-
Naught. manager of The Call, spoke
on "The Advancement of Journalism
Through the Universities of the Unit
ed States and the Establishment of
Schools of Journalism Within Them."
Mr. McNaught's talk was particularly
addressed to Stanford men, so many
of whom adopt. journalism as a pro
fession. He said in part:
Many university professors and many educa
tors believe practical Journalism cannot be
taught in the universities. In discussing this
there are three points to be considered: First,
Is there a system, theoretics!, in It? Second,
If so. can it be taught? Third, Is it Important
enough to form a school and devote the valu
able time of professors to it? All these ques
tions can be answered In the affirmative. .
The newspaper treats all matters, scientific
or common. In a way to show the effect it has
on the public. The temptation Is to appeal to
the lower Interests, because, by doing so. finan
cial success Is assured. The place of the uni
versity iÂ«Tto educate men to set a higher stand
ard, to raise Journalism above the mere clamor
of the crowd. The newspaper Is no longer
merely a news gatherer. I but it Is an organ to
select and edit news so that It is brought home
to the public. It !s the duty of our universi
ties to eer;d out a class of men who are. able
and who will raise the standard of journalism
and with It the level Â¦ of the mass of people
who read.

STANFORD UNIVERSITY, May 4.â
Customs inspectors visited Stanford
University yesterday morning: and re
paired to the Leland Stanford Jr. Mu
seum, where they. found the great cases
with their precious relics and curios
and statues which had been collected
by Mrs. Jane L. Stanford in India and
Egypt to be placed in the museum for
all time.
Piece by piece the valuable collection
was carefully lifted out and examined
and placed so as to allow of no trouble
when the time comes for the distribu
tion.
Each article had been classified and
numbered under Mrs. Stanford's per
sonal supervision, both in Egypt and
India, before being packed for trans
portation for America.
Mrs. Stanford was much surprised to
find that the collection made by her
in India and shipped to the university
six months ago had only- just arrived.
The packing and classifying was no
easy task, though Mrs. Stanford took
the greatest pleasure in the work. Next
Wednesday has been set by her as the
date when she will herself direct the
final placing of the rare specimens and
statuary in their proper place and then
will follow the cataloguing, which will
take no little thought and time.
Speaking of the collection and her
trip to various countries, Mrs. Stanford
said:
OLD 31YSTIC HISTORY.
I returned a little earlier than I had antici
pated, owing to certain matters which I felt
required my attention here. Indeed, I was
glad to see California, and it seemed to me it
never before looked so beautiful.
ThÂ« contrast with . the lands I have visitea
Is remarkable. Egypt, for instance. What a
wonderful atmosphere one enjoys there. It is
etrange aad mystic, but I like Its old, mystic
history.
There one feels as living in the great past
ages and knowing more what the Egyptians
Â¦were. Their very lives are told in their tem
ples, ar.d the antiquity of the race Is duly
appreciated.
All I have brought from Egypt for the mu
secm was discovered within two weeks of my
departure. The digger, a Shiek. brought them
to me. and the Government affixed Its stamp
uj>on each piece, and were, It not that the
specimens were intendi-d for the University
Museum they would not have allowed me to
take them from the country.
One cf the' moet remarkable specimens will
be found in a flint statue representing
Cheops, the builder of pyramids. It Is a per
fect statue. The veins of the hands and the
muscles stand out and altogether it â¢ is a
*trong and striking piece of workmanship.
The figure Is seated. The eiatue dates back
TOOO years before the birth of Christ. How in
terested the studepui will be in this speci
men!
Jewels, too. and gold necklaces and bracÂ«
lets and rings were discovered by the tomb,
a.'l of which we have safely here.
My impressions of Australia were varied.
The Sydney harbor is remarkable for Its
twautiful scenery, and Melbourne I consider
more lilt* a European, city than either Sydney
or Adelaide.
MEETS WAR VESSELS.
The voyage to India was intensely Interest
ing, as was the Journey tnrough middle India.
Going through the Suez Canal we passed four
Russian warships. At Aden we saw seven
warships, representing America. Germany and
Russia. That was a sight to behold.
on going Into Nagasaki our vessel, the Prince
Henry, was taken in tow by a Japanese vessel
for safe conduct, owing to 'the mines which
infested the waters.
At Yokohama the scene was not such as one
might imagine at a time when a nation's sons
are engaged in terrible warfare.
And this only because the Japanese are self
pofeseseed people and consider emotion a weak
ness.
The street* were deserted, no business was
being transacted and all were ready to close
their ftores and go out to fight for their Em
peror and their country.
They are a wonderful people. I saw a great
demonstration. It was one not to be easily
forgotten. A regiment was going to sail away
and paraded pasted the Grand Hotel, escorted
by the Emperor's Guard. The rain was pour-
Ing in torrents, but the crowds gathered and
the Chinese rerv&nts of the hotel rushed out,
waving their handkerchiefs and cheering. But
there wrre no tears shed by relative or friend.
When the Japanese go to war their kinsmen
do not weeo. for it â¢ Is a duty the soldier is
jwrrorming. Even the wife refrains from weep
ing and Kill say t-j her soldier-husband: "Go
and lay down your life for your country."
But while this.ftolld scene was being en
act e1 by the onlookers the soldiers continued to
paraoV. anl aÂ« more and more of them came
rn. dr^n<~hed by the great downpour, imagine
my delight to we them carrying an American
flag, the ctars and stripes, with their oxvn flag.
Women are voluntarily denying themselves
all luxuries that they may contribute to the
war fund. They even deny themselves the
customary habit of having their hair dressed,
anÂ«J the money that would go for that they
p!a<v; at the difropal of their 'country- Yet
tries* eamr people are unemotional, but they
arc patriotic. There Is something deep down
In th-?Ir hearts that they will not reveal to
th" world. They are a wonderful people.
I mad" a particular study of the Japanese
University, ani was accorded the privilege of
going through it.
Whfn . I saw r.hat the student body was
accomplishing on plain benches I could Â¦ but
make the mÂ»ntal comparison of thÂ« methods
in our own land.
There are tw*nty-Â»even of our graduate
Stanford etudtnts- occupying positions as pro
fesjiors in the Royal University. Toklo.
Dr. Jordan inform* me that at the present
time there sre thirty Japanese students in
Stanford University. I hear that they have
hired a h<rjse and have formed a club them
eelves.
â¢ Through an announcement of my arrival in
one of the Yokohama papers the president or
thiÂ»' Royal University, accompanied by one of
thÂ« r*erÂ»Â«es of the Empress School for peer
ett-.rr. journeyed to tender me an invitation to
a lecestion whirh they had planned to rive
mÂ». Owln* to the fatigue which the Journey
at that time would have entailed I regretted
that I to forego the pleasure such a visit
Â¦would have afforded me.
Speaking of some of her future plans,
Mrs. Stanford said:
My trip has been most beneficial to me. It
was a rest, and in about two more month*,
possibly ten weeks' time,, I intend to leave
for England and hope to spend August In
Norway and Sweden. I have also planned a
visit to Russia. Further than that. I have
not thought of excepting a contemplated trip
to Algiers In the winter.
My companions will be my niece. Miss Jen
nie Stanford Lathrop. and Miss Berner, my
eecretary.

NEW YORK, May 4.â All the large
shipyards in the metropolitan district,
except . that of the Boston- Drydock
Company in Brooklyn and the yard of

While seated on a porch at his home
he was seized with convulsions and
before medical aid arrived he was
dead. A story gained currency that
Richards had taken poison, but an
autopsy failed to establish the conten
tion, although it cannot be definitely
determined until the stomach is sent
to San Francisco for analysis.
Sheriff Walker, who has been work
ing on the case, notified Richards
Tuesday to call at the Sheriff's office
this morning to discuss the case and
the sudden death of Richards - has
caused the report that Richards deter
mined to put himself out of misery.
NEVADA CITY, May 5.âConsider
able excitement prevailed here this
morning over the announcement of the
sudden death of Henry Richards, re
lated to the late William Brown, who
was some three weeks ago murdered in
his own home. Some suspicion was at
tached to Richards, although he had
presented an alibi at the Coroner's in
quest. Ever since the crime was com
mitted Richards has been 111, but had
recovered and was about town Tues
day.

Is San Francisco to be graced with
a ulba? It looked last night aa
tliou^h Jt ir.isht â though not under
that renascent n&zse. "Sequoia," which
stands for strength and stability,
# is the baptismal name of the new
â¢Â£ubâ for such it is to-day, with a
preriient and secretary and all the
â¢other trimmings of a well-ordered or
ganization.
\Out there at the Hittell homeâ the
Jiom* of the historian, the home of
"tRe artist, likewise the temporary
. home of men and women who do
.things and think thinjrs â there met a
' i>ody of San Franciscans the type of
: whicii perhaps has never before been
gathered under one roof â artists,
V-ritors. musicians, historians, scien
tists.'professional men fraternized with
svora^n of wit, of achievement and
vromon of the smart set â that part
".of th**m, however, that knows how to

' M*er<Â»' Miss Ednah Robinson, the

quote the whole list.
Beneath a rooftnee of culture and
hospitality the new club was fittingly
â¢..craciied. Franklin K. Lane it was
.Â¦who told everybody why he was there
â¢ â for. the rrimal purpose of bringing
together "the people (that means men
and Tvom^n now â it used to mean only
the men) who draw and sing and
â¢write and do things worth while, to
fraternize and "club together" â with
out being brutally conscious of the
' presence of other people's husbands or
â¢wives. That was Madame de Stael's
idea â and it has beÂ«m pretty Miss Kob
_inson's. Xow, if those fostered friend- j
ships will only stay piatonic, and the

last night will only continue to at

night, why, this San Francisco salon
will show the Parisians how!
Amid many modest blushes Charles

Third Vice-President Buckalew of the
Machinists' Association says that the
trouble has just begun, and that not
another union man would return to
work. He further says many will go
out in sympathy.
In Topeka the shops seem to be run
ning up to their old capacity to-day,
but in the machine shops the force is
undoubtedly smaller. Neither the rail
road company nor the strikers are ask
ing for concessions and no reports of
violence are made.
The machinists' strike on the Santa Fe has
been pretty thoroughly exploited by the papers
and there is not much remaining to be said.
The company will have no difficulty in Oiling;
the placet) of the men who quit work. We have
no quarrel with unionism among our men.
We deal with unionism In the case of conduct
ors, engineers, flremen and trainmen, but these
unions have never made the outrageous de
mands to which we were asked to submit by
the machinists and which would have trans
ferred to the Machinists' Union the manage
ment of our shops. Of the men who left our
employ probably at least one-half did not want
to strike and were not in sympathy with the
demand made on us by the union, but felt obliged
to go out with the others. For this class I am
very sorry and realize the difficult position
in which they are placed. It may aa well be
understood, however, that no semi-public cor
poration owing duties to the public, such as
railroads, the street cars, the telegraph, tele
phone, etc.. can for one instant accept the
principles* of tlie "closed shop" or surrender Its
power to maintain order by discipline. There
never was order among large bodies of men
without discipline and there never will be.
TOPEKA. May 4.â Santa Fe officials
announced this morning a resumption
of shop work all along the line from
TopeJta to the Pacific Coast. They said
that In most cases the shops were run
ning with a full complement of men.
In many places union machinists have
gone out, but their" positions will all be
filled by the close of the week, say the
officials.
LOS ANGELES. May 4. â The Ex
press to-day publishes the following
statement from President E. P. Ripley
of the Santa Fe system on the subject
of the present strike of the machin
ists on the Santa Fe lines:
SAXTA FE'S PRESIDENT
' DISCUSSES THE STRIKE
When contractors appealed to ma
terial men to rush their orders they
were told that no material would be
furnished until a settlement of some
kind had been reached with the unions.
As none of the contractors have more
than a meager supply or material on
hand, construction on buildings, side
walks and other works of that'char
acter will be at a standstill unless the
controversy is speedily settled.
CHICAGO, May 4.â Fifty thousand
workmen employed in the building
trades in : this city will be thrown out
of employment within forty-eight hours
according to the statement of the as
sociation of manufacturers and deal
ers in building materials unless a
speedy settlement is reached between
the stone, lime and cement workers
and their employers. Nearly 1000 team
sters, hauling building and street work
material, were locked out to-day be
cause the union had called a strike in
two cases and work on a number of
buildings was stopped because the sup
ply of building material had been ex
hausted.
OSSINING, N. T., May 4.â Sam
Parks, the New York labor leader, who
was sent "to Sins Sing prison after hl3
conviction , on a charge of extortion,
died in; the prison to-day. He had
consumption at the time of his convic
tion and had failed rapidly since -he
was sent to Sing Sing. '
Parks after his first conviction was
brought to the prison on August 27
last. On securing, a new trial he was
released on ball on September 5. After
his second conviction he was brought
back to the prison on November 6 to
serve a term of two years and three
months. He was at first put to work
in the fiber brush shop, but his condi
tion became such that he was admitted
to the hospital and was under treat
ment there to the time of his death.
Parks was prominent for years in
labor circles, being a leader in Chicago
before cominjr to New York, and the
loyalty to him of his associates was re
markable. He was walking delegate,
or business agent, of the local House
smiths' and Bridgemen's Union for
several years and it was under his
leadership that the big strike of Iron
workers in New York last year was in
augurated. That strike involved the
national iron workers' organization
and * National President Buchanan
finally announced himself as against
Parks and the general strike through
out this country which the New York
leader sought to have ordered. The
contest was carried, to the annual con
vention of the organization, where
Parks won to the extent that he pre
vented the recognition of a rival union,
which had been approved by both
President Buchanan and the New York
contractors. During last summer
charges of extortion were made against
Parks and he was finally Indicted, It
being alleged that he had taken $500
from an employer on a promise to call
off a strike. Other similar charges
were made, but both times he was
tried on the same case.
After returning to New York from
Sing Sing, the first verdict having been
overturned by a higher court, Parks
was one of the central figures In the
Labor day parade last September.
When convicted the second time and
sentenced to Sing Sing he announced
that he had given up the fight for him
self and for labor and -wanted to die In
peace.

of Yellowstone County, Attorney Gen
eral James Donovan has instituted in
the Supreme Court quo warranto pro
ceedings to oust Thomas A. Williams
from the office of Clerk of the District
Court of Yellowstone County. 'The
complaint was filed to-day and the
matter will be presented to the court
to-morrow.
The Williams case is, one of the most
mysterious that has 'developed in, Mon
tana for years. Clerk Williams left
Billings late in February, going for a
trip to the coast as, far south as Cali
fornia. He spent a couple of days at
Helena with friends and then went to
Seattle. When he left Billings it was
known that he was to make some col
lections in one of the cities visited,
where he had private interests. He
wrote before going to San Francisco
that he had made a collection of $2000.
Williams journeyed on to San Fran
cisco, from which city he wrote to hfr
deputy at Billings, E. W. Dunn. In
that letter he said he was to start for
home the next day, returning by way
of Denver. That was the last word ever
heard from the missing man. He dis
appeared in San Francisco as com
pletely as if he had been shanghaied
and taken aboard a whaler. His friends
have almost become convinced that he
has met with foul play.
After a few weeks had passed with
out word from the missing man State
Examiner William Hudnall was asked
to go to Billings and examine the of
fice accounts of the clerk. This was
done and they were found straight, as
a string. To this day nothing has
been heardlof or from Williams and
the limit for the absence of an official
without permission of the County Com
missioners having expired application
was made to the Attorney General. to
bring the proceedings to declare the
office vacant.
UNION BUSINESS AGENT
: RECEIVES A BEATING
Fresno Painter Knocks Him Out for
Questioning His Right to Work
on a" New Building:.
FRESNO,. May, 14.â Business Agent
McDonald of the local Building Trades
Council heard this afternoon that Ful
ton G. Berry was employing a,non
union painter, Charles Skeed, to do the
calcimining on his new houses, being
erected in. Arlington Heights Addition.
McDonald went to. the place and, meet
ing Skeed, asked him who he was work
ing for and told him that he had better
quit, as the job 'would be declared un
fair. Skeed replied rather uncivilly and
told the agent to get off the premises.
McDonald delayed a little too long and
the ' painter started to 'use forceful
means to get him off. ._ A quarrel ensued
in which Skeed struck McDonald a
blow on the right ear that put him
down and out. - McDonald soon recov
ered and started to ; run away. Skeed
drew his putty knife and, pursuing
him, threatened to kill him if ever, he
interfered again on a job where he was
working. %

"It is an unpleasant thing to say
about university students, but it I3 a
fact that they cheat," said Professor
Soule tq-day. "They adopt all sorts of
methods, some ' of them , absolutely
shameless.' You see, it is unfair to
those students who do not cheat. It
raises the standard, because the cheat
passes a better examination as a rule
and makes it^ hard for the honest stu
dent to keep'up. I find these precau
tions necessary in order to stop the
practice."
BERKELEY, May 4.â In order to
prevent cheating in the examinations
among the students in the engineering
college at the University of California
Professor Frank Soule, dean of the de
partment, has taken unusual precau
tions this year to guard against the
smuggling in of data that would be
valuable to the student struggling
with a lot of abstruse problems in rail
road curves and bridge construction.
Professor Soule found that the most
extensive" "cribbing" was done through
the medium of the examination blank
books, so he took steps to prevent stu
dents getting them until they had been
attested with his stamp and signature.
Now he requires that the blank books
be purchased from his desk just before
the examinations begin and each book
is scrutinized to make sure that there
are mo data within its leaves. In this
way cheating is prevented so far as the
books are concerned.
In the old days students smuggled In
considerable data they . anticipated
would be useful to them in the exam
inations. This was usually in the back
of the book. But there. were and still
are easy ways^ to make examinations
easier. The mist" popular way is to
write the data -^on the cuffs. Shfrt
bosoms are popular, too, and some shirt
bosoms have at times looked like a
blackboard in,' a primary school. The
solea of the shoes are used now and
then, but this method has not quite
the vogue of the others.

The recent disclosures in regard to
uoney matters of Constable Edward
.\>idler have caueed the United State?
Tidelity and Guaranty Company to
>*tJUon the courts to he released from
ils bond of J2000. The company charge*
Â»im with malfeasance and asks that
he office be declared vacant. la the.
'neantime the Sheriff's deputies have
>een unable to locate Weidler, in order
o serve him with the necessary suxn
nons to appear in, court, and show
ra use why the request of the company
ihould not be granted.
The petition set g forth: First, that
JVeidler has failed to pay the annual
premium of tlO to the company for
foing on his bond; second, that tie has
legleeted to perform his duties: third,
hat he has collected different sums of
noney in the conduct of his 1 office which
ae has failed and refused to pay to
.he persons justly* entitled to the fame.
â¢ Wherefore the company prayÂ» the
jrfler of court declaring the omc^e of
Edward Weidler. as Constable of Oak
and, vacant, and releasing it as" surety
jpon his official bond from all liability
which may thereafter arise or. such
jond. . *
. Weidler himself has made the state
nest that he was about to resign his
sfflt-e. Whether he intends to do so has
not been made apparent. Such action
Â»n his part, it Is believed, will precipi
:ate a general descent of his creditors
jpon the surety company. Those who
lave simply loaned him money are
without recourse, but it is stated that
:here lire large sums of money which
tie has collected through attachments
fiven him to serve that he has not
paid to the persons to whom the money
.belongs, and that it is this money he
has used to cover up and eettle the Is
suance of double assignments of his
salary warrants.
It ".s believed that it is h-re that a
big deficit will he found in his accounts.
Many attorneys have made complain'
that it was as difficult to collect rnone*
from him as it was to g*t it from their
debtors, and much work has been taken
Â¦ way from the Justice's court and done
through the Sheriff's office. â¢ Â¦>** V
. Constable Bert Hempstead must meet
En accusation filed against him with
the Grand Jury, for the alleged reten
tion of SIM bond money which, it is
charged, he has failed to return, .and
there is now pending a suit to recover
the money frorn^ him. The complaint
is made by Attorney James H. Borer,
and he Â¦was a witness before the Grand
Jury to-day and.'gave a history.of the
case to that body.
In his complaint he states that last
November- he began an action looking
to the ousting of Hempstead from of
fice for the illegal retention of a $150
cash bond that had been deposited Jn
thy suit of Victor Ligrda against H V.
Brown. Llgda recovered judgment for
hiu c'aim. amounting to $190.
He wished to attach some cows, and
in order to protect himself from a
claim made by Brown's wife that some
of the cows belonged to her, Hemp
fe-tead insisted that Ligda put up a bond
of $150. Hempstead still has the money i
and says he is entitled to keep It until
the time has *xpired in which Mrs.
Brown can legally make a claim. Con
stable H^mpptead as well as Justice of;
the Peace Quinn, before whom the case !
was tried, insist that there is nothing
wrong in Hempstead's actions.

A constable armed with a subpena,
: backed up by the majesty of the law,
and assisted with all the strategies
that he could think of, failed to serve
the process on Mrs. Jacques Loeb, wife
of Dr. Loeb, the distinguished physiol
ogist of the University of California.
Mrs. Loeb outwitted this limb of the
law at every turn in the game of hide
and seek and to-day he was forced to
confess in Justice Quinn's court in
Oakland that the woman was too
much for him.
Mrs. Loeb was sought as a witneBS in
the case of John Maley, whose sobri-'
quet is "Jack the Hugger.". It needed
her testimony and the testimony of her
maid to help convict the fellow. The
two women had seen the so-called hug-
B<?r display his bearish propensities on
the campus and as he was getting
more vicious with every hug the police
were anxious to convict him.
But Mrs. Loeb refused to be served
with a^ subpena. Constable C. W. Kil
lion found this out after he had called
at the Loeb residence, corner Oxford
and Adilison streets, three or four
times, only to be informed that the
lady of the house was out.
Then Killion planned a regular cam
paign and laid himself out for a long
wait. It had become a matter of pride
with him. He sent other people to the
Loeb residence, but they came back
with the same disappointing result. .
Scaling ladders were thought of at one
time, but it was Been that entering a
man's house,, that way was a violation
of the right of domicile.
Strategy was the last resort and Kil
lion went to the Loeb kitchen door dis
guised as a butcher's boy. But the
disguise didn't carry the man any far
ther than the kitchen door. There he
met the lady's maid. He served the
papers on her, but she (barred the rest
of the way. Then Killion gave it all j
up as a bad investment.
Ab it turned out, however, neither
the testimony of Mrs. Loeb nor. her
maid was necessary. "Jack the Hug
ger'.' was convicted upon the testimony
of others and now there will be no
more of this hugging in Berkeley. '
FRESNO, May 4.â Lincoln J. Mitch
ell, a well to do farmer of Fowler, who
for the last two years has been a bene
dict, but 'who has not seen his wife
since a few minutes after they, were
married, to-day secured an anulment
of the marriage. The shattering of
Mitchell's faith In the fair sex is a
strange story. Two years ago he de
cided to take a wife to himself and
answered an advertisement in a mat
rimonial paper. After arrangements
had been made for. the wedding, he
went to San Francisco and met his
wife, Ida M. Mitchell, who lives at
2110 Sixth street, West Berkeley. To
the Justice of the Peace's was a short
distance and the knot was soon tied.
When they reached the corner of the
street the wife turned tq Mitchell and
said: "I am going home now. You
can go where you like. I am done
with you." From that day to this
Mitchell has not seen his wife.

Mary A. Mitchell, the sister, who
has been appointed administratrix,
stated to Judge Greene that she had
omitted naming the horse in her In
ventory of her brother's property upon
instruction -from her father. She aft
erward reconsidered her action, and
told the court the horse was a legal
asset of the estate. Woods says that
the whole trouble has been brought on
by a quarrel between his daughter and
his daughter-in-law, both of whom are
endeavoring to gain possession of
Greenock. In the meantime, it was an
nounced in the court, the horse has
broken down and cannot run. The es
tate left by the jockey is appraised at
about 12500.
Judge Greene, in his decision, de
clared that undoubtedly the horse
Greenock was a part of Jockey Woods'
estate, and that forgery and perjury
had been committed during the pro
ceedings.
Judge Greene this morning declared
that a forged document had been pre
sented to him among the papers in
the matter of the estate of Jockey
Woods, and wa'rned the parties now
making a contest over the settlement
of the estate. He read the section of
the Penal Code in relation to the pun
ishment of one who presents a forged
document to the court, and then 'con
tinued the case until Friday, in order
to further investigate the matter.
The 'trouble has arisen over the own
ership of the racehorse Greenock,
which a sister of the deceased jockey
says belonged to him and is rightful
ly a. part of his estate, though James
Woods, the father, claims . that the
horse belonged to him. Irrsupport of
this he produced a bill of sale from
the Schorrs to a half interest in the
horse for $265; but the figures had been
erased and 5365 substituted.

The wholesale merchants of the city
have taken an active part in making
the big exposition a success. Califor
nia products are orr display in many
booths; which . have been tastily ar
ranged by the exhibitors. During the
afternoon and evening of yesterday, a
large crowd was in attendance at the
pavilion. The different exhibitors stood
behind their booths and distributed
samples of their wares to the ladles.
All went, away well pleased with the
exhibition and with their arms fll led
with household suggestions in the way
of samples . of good things to eat and
other necessities ; that , go to make . up
a happy home. ;
"Twelve million dollars was invested
in real estate during the last year,"
said Secretary Stearns, "and 957 dwell

roads and, from the growth of the
population, the people who travel over
these roads like the place. An increase
of 24 per cent in three years is in ad
vance of any first-class city in the
country during the same period."
Boarding the cars again an hour
later, the grocers and their friends
started for Haywards. At San Leandro
a stop was made and the visitors
were escorted through fruit groves and
gardens. At Alameda the passengers
were showered with flowers by school
children and each presented with a
handsome bouquet. Then all, radiant
with smiles of pleasure, took the Key
route and returned to San Francisco.

were invited to the Hotel Metropole,
where a delicious luncheon was served.
During the course of the luncheon Ed
win Stearns, secretary of the Oakland
Board of Trade, made an address,
which conveyed to the visitors some
idea of the merits of life in Alameda
County. He stated its advantages
from a standpoint of commerce, cli
mate and social condition.
FACTS STATED.
OAKLAND, May 4.â It was a gala
day in Alameda County for members
of the National Grocers' Association,
who are in convention on the other side
of the bay. More than 100 of the dele
gates from various cities of the United
States arrived during the forenoon on
the "Key Route" and at once became
the suests of the Alameda County
Grocers' Association and the Mer
chants' Exchange.
The party, which was accompanied
by many ladies, was conveyed by Epe
cial cars and given an opportunity to
see every point of interest in Alaineda,
Oakland and Berkeley and the nearby
suburban towns. All expressed pleas
ure over the cordial reception extended.
At the Key Route mole an escort con
sisting of Charles H. Taylor, W. J.
Hopkins, George Russell, W. W. Miller,
J. S. Wixson. E. E. Muller, Wilber
Walker, E. Stearns, H. D. Cushing.
George Hoffman, F. J. Lea and Frank
M. Ferguson oft this city awaited the
visitors. A rapid ride was made to
Berkeley, where Wilber Walker ex
plained the growth of the university
and showtd the party about the
grounds. The excursionists were re
turned to this city by way of Telegraph
avenue and then a trip was taken to
Piedmont Heights. At the latter point
the Sulphur Springs Gardens were vis
ited. : ::-.*;.

tnrdaj: morning, for the occupants of
those roo:ns were anxious to be on
hand at the ferry promptly at 8 o'clock
jo participate in the excursion to Asti,
Sonoma County, given for their bene
fit by the California Northwestern
Railway and the Italian-Swiss Colony.
Expectations of a street car strike had
c"a,used many of them to leave a call
.for. some hours previous to their de
parture as a matter of assurance. Hap
.jii.ly tfc'ej' did not have to walk to the
ferry building as cars yere running
e.nd gave them ample tfme. Smiling
,fac>s were apparent on every side as
the g^tes were thrown open for the
crowd to the number of 272, which filed
*cu the ferry-boat J. M. Donahue and
â¢look' their places for the trip to Tibu

In the morning returned in the evening
a* hilarious laughs and the Retail Gro
'cers of America Joyfully clasped the
I'ands of the inen who had contributed
Â¦ to. much to their pleasure and express
ed their thanks In language which only
a .trip to Asti would supply. .
Before leaving the grounds each vis
itor was presented with a bottle of
wine by the management of the winery.
Jollification followed the entire party
on the return trip and at the ferry
the delegates separated to prepare for
the evening at the Chutes.
DELEGATES ATTEND CHUTES.
Even though two excursions were
attended during the day, delegate after
delegate, accompanied by tastefully
gowned ladies, appeared at the Chutes
and applauded the regular programme
and the special stereopticon views and
lecture by a representative of a me
chanical device to curtail grocers' la
bors. Some 200 seats had been re
served in the boxes for the delegates
and their ladies and not a seat was
vacant, although Asti's exhilarating
influence had been encountered dur
ing the day and the beauties of Ala
meda County had been absorbed.
The delegates were there for the
fun they could have, and they took ad
vantage of the opportunity to applaud
any tip from the stage which had the
least touch of the grocery business in
the repartee.
The illustrated lecture was a matter
which appealed to the sterner sex, for
it portrayed how the pennies might be
saved and eventually accumulate into
dollars. Though the ladies accom
panying the delegates as wives, moth
ers and sweethearts like to know that
their husbands, sons and expectant
husbands have the coin, they do not
see the necessity of displaying upon
canvas the methods by which that
money is accumulated. Nevertheless
the show was heartily appreciated by
the visitors and they left with that
"tired feeling" from their hard day's
rest.
This morning the delegates will get
down to business and if possible close
up the work of their seventh annual
session.
If the work can be brought to such
a condition as is contemplated the
; election of officers will occur this
morning instead of this afternoon, and

in the order named.
A call was made for "Dixie." Miss
Blanche Chenault of Little Rock was
assisted to the top of one of the long
tables and in a clear voice sang that
air so popular in the South, and the
delegates joined in the chorus. Every
body sang "America" as the call was
sounded for the return trip.
Andrea Sbarboro extended to the
guests the official welcome of the Asti
corporation, of which he is the presi
dent, and stated that he was proud of
the fact that twenty-three years ago
he was a grocer's clerk and that the
national association of that callirtg
were there assembled. All were re
quested to throw care to the winds and
enjoy themselves to the utmost. They
did.
Having viewed all the Bights thÂ«s
guests were invited to the "Arbor,"
where refreshments were served in true
California style. Fully an hour was
consumed and eatables of all charac
ters, from chicken to ham and olives
to oranges, went with the time. Then
came the flow of souls from the in
spiring of wjtrming wines, and ere the
whistle sounded the call for departure
the National Retail Grocers had added
their testimony to the character of Cal
ifornia's hospitality.
Daniel F. Keefe acted as master of
ceremonies. In assuming that Impor
tant position, he bid the guests wel
come to Sonoma County in the name
of the Asti corporation and told how
the convention at Kansas City- last
year had consented to come to Cali
fornia and accept of the hospitality
of the Golden West as he had pictured
it at that time. He felt sure that the
delegates and their ladies who were in
sound of his voice could certify ta the
fact that that promise had been ful
filled. The speaker's remarks needed
no further indorsement than the ap
plause which greeted the statement.

guests were divided into two parties
and taken through the entire plant and
shown the greatest wine tanks in the
ITnited States. In one of the basements,
Where the wine is placed in casks for
shipment, glasses of the different bev
erages were handed to each guest to
sample and from the way the retail
grocers smacked their lips as they sip
ped the nectar the Asti wines will have
a heavy demand at the banquet to
night.
President Lott is not a candidate for
re-election in the sense of personally
desiring the office, and up to last night
had importuned his friends not to ad
vance his name as a candidate.
If Mr. Lott's name is sprung oi\ the
convention for re-election it will have
a strong following, but the unwritten
law of the association will mean the
election of A. W. Farlinger of At
lanta, Ga. ' '..-Â¦
An important change was decided
upon yesterday, and that Is In re
gard ,to the banauet to be held to
night. It was intended to give the
ladies a separate room for the enjoy
ment of a menu to be served them
exclusively, while the masculine por
tion of the convention was to have a
bachelor-like time in the adjoining
gallery. That plan is all changed. The
ladies will be seated at the same
tables as their husbands and escorts
and the bachelor plan has gone glim
mering.
The original programme for to-day
is as follows:
Report of committee on' resolutions; reports
of the committees; ehcrt addresses by editors
of grocery papers; open discussions of Fame

, Many wholesale firms of this city
have gone to great expense in fitting
up their booths in the pavilion. The
different food stuffs that they display
arc arranged so as to interest any one
who may visit the^big exposition. Vis
itors to the display can get samples
enough with which to start housekeep
ing. The wholesale merchants desire
to place their goods before the public

distributing samples and reading mat
ter regarding their products.
The committee in charge of the ex
position has arranged a series of nights

WE recently commented upon the report of Ger
man climatologists in which the effect of for
ests upon climate was greatly minimized. The
report appeared to be .1 complete reversal of the conclu
sions heretofore reached by foresters in this country and
in Europe. The observations of the Germans appear to
have included temperature only, and temperature is un
doubtedly an important element in climate. We dis
trusted tbe utility of generalizing from the facts of the
report, since the observations in a country like German}'
might not apply to other regions, differing in topog
raphy, extent and important physical conditions. For
esters base their claims upon the function of forests in
controlling: the penetration of the soil by water, and its
slower delivery into streams and drainage channels.
Foresters in this country and Europe have demon
strated the more constant humidity in forests due to
slower evaporation. Trees protect the soil from the
evaporative effect of the winds. The wind break of
trees is of great importance in all arid and semi-arid re
gions. Its importance on the plains in the great valley
of California is not to be over-estimated. If fields and
orchards are protected against our desiccating north
wind by frequent and dense wind breaks of forest trees
its often distressing effects will be much, mitigated.
In France observations of the, effect of forest upon
evaporation have been carried on for a third of a cen
tury, and have recently been collected and published by
M. Raoul de Drouin de Bouville, in his "Observation de
MetcoroioRic Forestiere." His summary is that during
the months of November, March and April, for which
data are available for ihc entire time covered by the re
port, the evaporation on open ground was twice as great
as in the forest. During the summer months the differ
ence is greater, owing to the presence of foliage in the
deciduous forests. Outside and inside the forests the
proportion of evaporation is, in May, 3 to 1; in June,
July and August, 5 to 1; in September, 4 to 1, and in
Where snow fall occurs the forest protection from
wind and the leaf litter cause a slower melting and the
water goes into the ground. Another interesting thing
observed is that in forests less moisture reaches the
ground because it is interrupted by the forest cover, and
an appreciable percentage is arrested by the limbs and
foliage. But this in turn preserves the equilibrium of
moisture between the atmosphere and the soil surface
and retards evaporation. â¢
The observations of M. de Bouville are supplemented
by those of American foresters. In the bulletins of the
Bureau of Forestry of the Agricultural Department at
Washington, it is shown that in the formerly wooded
sections of the upper Mississippi Valley the crust of the
earth is drying out, though the actual rainfall remains
the same. The foresters report that while it cannot be
safely asserted that forest destruction has produced any
diminution in the annual rainfall, the amount of -water
which finds its* way into the streams â that is the rainfall
minus the evaporation â is less than when primeval- for
est conditions were undisturbed.
The power of the soil to hoid and store water ' has
been greatly impaired by destruction of the forests.
This causes a more rapid run-off and great fluctuation
in the flow of streams, alternating between destructive
floods and a very small flow or none at all. The streams
hecome torrential. Their channels become narrower
and deeper and the water they carry loses its value for
any economic use. These evils are not due to any lack
of rainfall, but to destruction of the storage capacity of

FORESTS AND CLIMATE.
The marshals appointed by the Board of Education to
secure a census of the school children of this city com
plain that unusual difficulty attends their task because
of the law requiring signatures of parents. It should be
emphasized at once that no difficulty will be permitted
tOi interfere with sa important a service as this to San
Francisco. The public. schools need all the money they
can secure. and no dereliction on the part of the officials
should reduce the sum. ..
AT a meeting in Epworth Hall on Monday, crowded
with eminent people from all parts of the, world,
who had come here to attend the missionary con
vention of the Methodist Episcopal church, the Rev.
George B. Smyth, D.D., chairman of the executive com
mittee, took occasion to make some very pointed re
marks on the manner in which the press handled the
news of the big convention. He said:
"All have worked nobly and unselfishly toward the
success attained and we arc deeply indebted to the San
Francisco Call for the generous manner it has given its
valuable space for the publication of the important
matters which have come before the great missionary
convention. The Call has done well by us indeed, arid I
cannot understand why it is that all the press has not
shown the same .appreciation of the presence in San
Francisco of men of world-wide importance, men from
afar over the seas, from India and Africa, from China
and Japan, from- Korea and other parts. When so dis
tinguished a people come to our State, what better means
of advertising could we have? Tf^The Call then I pro
pose a vote of thanks and to the editors personally."
Why should not all the press, if united as it should
be on every proposition relating to this city's interests,
properly recognize the presence here of such eminent
gentlemen as those comprising the convention? What
better opportunity could San Francisco have to spread a
knowledge of her advantages to the ends of the earth
than to send away as her emissaries people so distin
guished in letters and in the high calling of the church?
This city has been trying to establish a reputation as a
convention city, and has been so far largely successful.
If the treatment of convention news by the press be
half-hearted, what encouragement is there for other or
ganizations to meet here in the future? This paper
neither courts nor expects compliments for doing its
obvious duty in printing the news. It simply gave to
the missionary convention the news space it merited.
Here was an illustration where, instead of sending out
agents to tell of our advantages, men of the highest cul
ture and intelligence came to us to be impressed by the
object lessons here shown. If, instead of taking advan
tage of such a chance for the dissemination of a knowl
edge of this city and State, we accept everything with
out recognition, what can be expected in return? We
have many associations striving for the city's advance
ment and the press should do its share. To a certain ex
tent it is the mouthpiece of the people, and if it speak
not in welcome, our boasted Western hospitality will
not count for much. With The Call singled out from
among the five daily papers of this city as the only one
officially recognized for having done what it should do
in ordinary courtesy, it is hardly to be expected, to say
the least, that the 4000 people attendant upon the mis
sionary convention will return to their homes tingling
with pleasure because of San Francisco's hospitality.
THE DUTY OF THE PRESS.
A suggestion has been made^ that the United States
take the initiative in creating an international congress
to discuss the possibility of arbitration and perhaps re
duction of armaments among the great nations of the
world. For reasons, personal, private and imperative, it
is extremely likely that Russia and Japan will plead a
previous engagement.
When Sergeant of Police Michael
Joseph Conboy, known the length and
breadth of San Francisco, gained as
pirations to advancement there was
great ado In the Conboy household.
"Joe." as his familiars style him. went
off watch* one morning and informed
his better half that he purposed to
become a lieutenant; to shake his
non-commissioned chevrons for the
shoulder straps of the higher rank.
# To attain the honor it was neces
sary for the ambitious sergeant to
pass an examination under the law of
municipal charter. That did not
feaze "Joe," but it caused ructions at
home.
One morning a friend of the Con
boys called. Mrs. Conboy went to the
door.
"Is 'Joe' at home?" was the query.
"Don't speak a word," whispered
the lady of the house.
"Don't breathe." she insisted.
"What's the matter?" demanded the
puzzled visitor.
"We can't talk. We can't do any
thing but walk on our tiptoes." ex
plained Mrs. Conboy. " "Joe's* up
stairs studying grammar, geography
and heaven only knows what for his
examination. Since he began we can
only think we are alive. We all feel
as if we were neighbors to a ceme
tery."
Nevertheless "Joe" won the shoul
der straps.
The Great Calm.
! The tragedy which deprived the Em
peror of Korea of his Queen occurred
less than ten years ago. She was saM
to be much stronger mentally than hÂ«r
espoused lord, and to control his acts.
One night, according to the. story that
is tuld among the Europeans in the
Korean capital, a Japanese girl, who
had been employed in the court, con
ducted a band of murderers, said to
represent Japanese interests, through
the labyrinth of paths, lanes and one
story structures which comprise the
buildings on the palace grounds to an
unostentatious pavilion. Here, remote
from the entrance and close to the

There is n great army of music teach

IT is gratifying to the public that the street carmen
voted 1)3* such a large majority not to strike. To the
public the reasons for a strike and all of its serious
consequences seemed lacking and brought face to face
with the situation the carmen themselves agreed with
the public.
The result demonstrates that a balance has been estab
lished in the community. Organization is not all on one
side. Public opinion is organized, and there is a grow
ing disposition of both parties to a labor dispule to look
on both sides of the issue, and the result is a greater
conservatism. Formerly an unorganized public opinion,
seeing the employer yield, concluded that surrender was
an acknowledgment that he was wrong, when in fact he
surrendered to an unbalanced force. Now that organized
public opinion supplies the balance that was Licking, we
have an industrial equilibrium, in which both parties to
an industrial dispute are more apt to get their rights
because they do not have to surrender them to force.
in these new conditions the sentimental belief that an
employer is always wrong will wear away, and be re
placed by the conviction that a man does not become an
outlaw when his enterprise makes him an employer. In
this better atmosphere labor will be freer than it has
been, and the prompt and reasonable and cheerful de
cision of the carmen will probably mark a new depart
ure in the industrial policy and history of San Francisco,
in which neither employer nor employe will be subject to
the arbitrary will of the other, but each will realize that
there are bounds that he must not pass, for organized
public opinion, the third party, the community, calls a
halt.
The carmen have felt that first of all they are citizens,
and not members of a separate and distinct class to
which the public interest is of no importance. They
have taken good counsel because they took their own,
in good American fashion, and their wisdom is vindi
cated by their decision. The threatened strike has hung
for weeks like a cloud over the immediate future of San
Francisco, but now it has passed, and we enter the activ
ities of the season under an industrial sky that is clearer
than for many years.
In connection with the accomplishment of this happy
result credit is due to Mayor Eugene E. Schmitz, whose
conciliatory energies were given with such marked suc
cess to a peaceable solution of the difficulty that threat
ened so much of discoid, distress and disorder to San
Francisco. At a time when mediation seemed hopeless
Mayor Schmitz submitted his good offices, labored with
both sides in the controversy and assisted in winning not
only for them but for the great third party in interest, the
general public, a signal triumph.
"The boy was right, too." he said.
"When I hunted up the record I found
he was arrested for being out after 8
o'clock, for throwing stones, for play
ing ball in the streets, for breaking a"
window, for jumping on and off cars,
and for almost everything else that a
boy does to bring himself under my
jurisdiction."
The Judge frowned, but it was no
ticed that he quickly covered his
mouth with his hand.
Later, in telling of the incident, the
Judge had a hearty laugh.
"Miscellaneous mischief, sir."
It was only the other day that a
youngster barely 12 years of ago was
before the Judge on a charge of mali
cious mischief. "Well. Â¦Willie." said the
Court when the urchin boldly marched
up in response to his name, "What
brings you here?"
The boy hesitated for a moment and
then blurted out:
Judge Murasky has great difficulty at
times maintaining a stern face such as
is necessary during a session of the
Juvenile Court. The urchins that come
before him are, as a rule, street Arabs
with wits sharpened to a degree that
renders them hard subjects to deal
with, and quite frequently .they give
answers to the Judge's questions that
would bring a smile to the face of a
misanthrope and just when the least
semblance of a smile on the face of the
Judge would spoil the good effects of
the Judge's lecture.
Miscellaneous Misch ief.
The importance of music as an in
fluence in our lives cannot be overesti
mated. It Is not only one of the finest
of the fine arts, but one of the most
Important of the liberal arts. Its uni
versality is common knowledge. It Is
seen everywhere in natureâ rin the
wind. In the waterfall, the song of the
bird. Its relation to nature is funda
mental. It is more Important than
the plastic arts, architecture, painting
and sculpture, because it represents
life and motion.
The living organism experiences de
light in growth. The right kind of
musical instruction reaches the intel
ligence of the pupil and he is attracted
and Interested by the sensation of
growth from the very beginning. In
teaching the mind the mind teaches
the fingers; no other method of
musical Instruction is rational and no
other method ever was or ever will be
successful.
â¢ â¢ â¢
Dr. Bartholomew, in his "Relation
of Psychology to Music." say?: "Who
ever you may be, you have the musical
faculty, and you may achieve com
mendable success in the line of your
desires. . Application will tell the
story. â¢ â¢ â¢ Every normal hu
man soul has capacity for learning
arithmetic, history, languages, sciences,
literature, the arts, bu?lness, sten
ography, banking, locomotive engi
neering, typesetting, house-building,
stonecuttlng. etc.. but not every one
may be a master In each of these lines.
So each and every soul has ca
pacity for appreciating and learning
music. â¢ â¢ â¢ The musical faculty
is not an exclusive gift of the favored
few*. Let the mischievous delusion
that hws so long held sway be dispelled
once for all. Musical science and
musical art rest on the same psycho
logic basis ns everything else that may
be learned."
No healthy mind lacks the musical
faculty. It is a great mistake to-as
suaic that because a child shows no
"talent" for music it should be de
prived of the inestimable benefit of
correct teaching in music. If one gen
eration of American children were to be
truly educated in music â were to re
ceive training addressed to the head
instead of to the handâ the benefit to
the nation at large would be Incalcul
able. It would appear in a vastly im
proved physical condition; public and
private morality would be conserved
and penal statistics would show a
gratifying decrease In all forms of
crime. Incidentally one effect would
be that our great permanent orchestras
would no longer face annual deficits
as a result of failure to educate the
musical taste of the public.
iicnlus is defined by ability to create.
Mozart would never have been re
garded as a genius were he not able
to create music; and it was just as
necessary for Mozart to master the
technical elements of music as for any
other person.
There is a prevalent notion that at
times nature casts up out of the sea
of humanity "an indefinable prodigy
known as genius; that these erratic
products can without effort or appli
cation create masterpieces of music,
sculpture, painting or literature, and
that they spring into being intellectual
ly mature, like Minerva, bristling with
armor, from the head" of Jupiter. There
is no greater fallacy. Men are differ
ently endowed with those physical
qualities which make intellect possible,
but, after all, genius Is nothing more
nor less than an intelligent application
of the mental faculties,
Wagner could not have written his"
magnificent music dramas without a
complete and thorough knowledge of
the technicalities of music. Goethe,
than whom there was none better qual
ified to speak, says: "It is precisely
genius that learns the laws of art and
pays them the readiest obedience."
To be nbie to think In music Is the
basis of true culture in music. This
involves ability to hear with the eye
end !o see with the ear. It is not neces
sary to read aloud in order to under
stand English, and any person unable
to put in writing what he hears Is ill
equipped In general culture. That a
different idea ehould prevail when
music is considered surpasses under
standing. It is due to the lack of gen
uine music culture that persons of un
doubted ubility close their minds when
they close their pianos. No person is
worthy of being called a musician until
he can render his thoughts and emo
tions in musical terms. To the musi
cian, the world and its experiences are
simply musical ideas unexpressed. To
acquire facility in transforming
thoughts, reflections, experiences and
emotions into musical terms, it Is
necessary to master ihe technicalities
of music. It is not impossible for any
one to learn this. The impossibilities
lie not in the mind, but in the methods.
Is not the condition of that person to
bo deplored who is able to originate
great ideas, and is yet unable to- ex
press them because he has not master
ed the English language' Full many
an idea in music is allowed to waste
its sweetness on the desert air simply
because the possesso-r is unable to re

the soil. When this process has gone far enough to in
flict serious economic losses the people affected will
probably turn to artificial storage as a remedy. Another,
or a supplemental, remedy is available by planting trees
on all lands that have an agricultural value below their
value as forest tracts. /
Experiment has shown that improved agricultural
processes may increase the storage capacity of tilled
land. The Campbell system is in operation in the dry
region of Western Kansas. It consists in fallowing the
land in rotation. After every rainfall the surface is im
mediately pulverized by alternate harrowing and rolling,
furnishing a mulch which retards evaporation and pre
sents an absorbent surface for the next shower. By this
process all land jthat has a clay subsoil is made a reser
voir for water, and when cropped the stored water
reaches the roots of the crop by capillary attraction.
After many efforts large areas in Western Kansas had
been abandoned as unfit for agriculture on account of
aridity. These are being reoccupied by the Campbell
system and are producing paying crops of all varieties
suited to the region. About ten inches of rainfall is
saved from evaporation and stored in the soil.
It is found that where this system is practiced springs
appear and drainage channels have an increasing and
steady flow. It will be seen that this is a substitute for
forest cover, as far as it affects the moisture of the sub
soil and the run-off of streams. We conclude from all
this that the data of the German 'climatologists wa3 in
sufficient as a premise for the conclusions they reached.
The practical lesson for California farmers on our plains
is to arrest evaporation caused by wind action by plant
ing dense and frequent wind breaks. This is just as es
sential where water for irrigation is plentiful as where
it is scarce, for the sudden evaporation of water from
an irrigated soil leaves it hard, crusty and Unfavorable
for the production of crops.

ACCIDENT AT [BREWERY
RESULTS IN FATALITY
The cause for the meeting was to
hear Burnham's ideas upon the beau
tifying of a large city, and it was for
this purpose that he was invited here
by the members of the association for
the improvement and adornment of
San Francisco. James D. Phelan, who
is a strong advocate of artistic im
provements, acted as toastmaster.
Burnham, tt]e guest of henor, was
the first speaker ailed upon.
He elaborated upon the advantages
of a beautiful city, and told how a city
may be made beautiful. He said that
not only did the architectural designs
improve the general appearance of a
municipality, but that flowers, palms
and greens, artistically adorned v-pon
buildings and homes, all tended to
make a pleasing effect, arid that If It
is impossible to tear down old struc
tures and replace them with more mod
ern ones the next best thing to do
is to decorate the old ones.
D. H. Burnham. the well-known
architect from Chicago, was the guest
of honor at an informal dinner given
at the St. Francis Hotel last night. The
dinner was attended by about thirty
prominent business men of this city,
all of whom are interested in the gen
eral appearance of San Francisco.
It was announced that the architects
of the city would hold a reception at
the hall of San Francisco Chapter of
the American Institute of Architects,
on the fifth floor of the Phelan building,
at 10 o'clock to-morrow morning. All
architects are invited to attend this
meeting.
At the conclusion of the speeches, by
unanimous vote it was declared: "It
is the sense of the meeting that Mr.
Burnham be invited to draft a plan for
the improvement and advancement of
San Francisco."
Mr. Burnham also recommended that
henceforth local architects and builders
unite their efforts in making this mu
nicipality as artistic and pleasant as
possible.
Others that spoke upon the subject
of architectural art were Allen Pollok,
manager of the St. Francis Hotel;
William Greer Harrison, H. U. Bran
denstein, John McCaleb, John Mc-
N'aujrht, A. A. Watkins, James Itied.
John Galen Howard, Bruce. Porter,
Frank J. Symmes and Leon Sloss.

will again speak on the subject of last
night's address.

- vention by one Marino. Regalado was
then President of Salvador and in that
capacity was in full and active at
* lendance at the convention. He made
a. speech, so says the taie told on the
Acapu'cj, in which he denounced Cab
rerÂ«> as ail kinds vt a coward. He
made 'other acutely personal and pecu
* ! : ar!y Central American remarks, which
f^o affronted Marino that he strode from
tnr convention hall and returned to
' Guatemala City.
SHOOTS OUT WINDOWS.
R^pralado, enthused by his own ef
.-fftivp eloquence, punctuated his clos
ing -remarks by shotting out the win
*.dows of* the convention hall. Later
?hc adjourned to the street and kept
-up tfie' artillery punctuation long after
his rocal ammunition had been ex
"ftjiupted.
Marino, as he left the convention,
lr.Jd vnapped his- fingers at Regalado
anjd from the cover of a stout pillar
had expressed the opinion that the
oratorical firebrand would not have
dared to burn had Cabrero been pres
ent.
,** RegaJa<to was reminded of this and.
having-' had a glut of glass-breaking
.ordered- out his paddle horse and started
for Guatemala City. This is an eighty
mile' ride, but at the end of the dusty
road Regalado's ardor had lost none
* fif its he"at.
Forcing his way into Cabrero's pres
. f noe, RjCg-alado placed his pistol , at his
brother President's head and repeated
the warmest portions of his convention
â¢^peech.-
A PRESIDENTIAL BAT.
." The Presidents then had a drink;
then another. Still one more, and there
was launched a "good time," which
' lasted four days and set a new stand
ard for Jamborees in the high life of
the southern republic.
Regalado departed and some weeks
later, pn runs the stoTy. Cabrero de
clared that his dignity had been in
sulted.' lie demanded reparation. Re
galado refused, but suggested that
â¢Costa Rica be requested to arbitrate
* the difficulty. There the matter re
mqlns. There has been and Â¦will be
no arbitration. Regalado resigned the
Presidency of Salvador in favor of Es
calon, but as Minister of War still con
* trols the ermy of which he ia proud
and w'hose mottle, it is paid, he wants
to' test against Cabrero's forces.
* Meanwhile the insult to Cabrero is
imavenged and Guatemala clamors for
apology. Ropalado relieves the monot
..ony of the time Of waiting by shooting
-the pJpes and cigarettes from the
". mouths of his staff officers.

plain Needs of Offices
The Board of Works yesterday
transmitted to the Board of Super
visors the petition of the Dairymen's
Association et al. for the acceptance
of Mission road, from Crescent avenue
to the county line, together with two
diagrams showing a proposed change
of grade on the road.
Assessor Dodge wanted $48,200 for
salaries required by the charter; $46,
000 for extra clerks and $1000 for ex
penses. The total amount is $1500
less than the office was allowed last
year. Dodge told of the increase in
the business hi his office, which com
prised from 7000 to 8000 additional
statements yearly.
Dodge urged the committee to rec
ommend an appropriation of $10,000
for the Bureau of Engineering to pre
pare block maps of the city, which
would be of great convenience in de
scribing assessments and effect a sav
ing.
Sheriff Curtis asked for $84,800 for
salaries, the same as last year, but
pleaded for an additional van driver
at $900 per year. Curtis also wants
$1220 for expenses, $6000 for main
tenance of jails and $12,875 for re
pairs to jails, and the committee took
the requests under advisement. The
committee adjourned to meet Friday
at 1:30 p. m.
Â«
Wants Mission Road Accepted.
Recorder Godchaux asked for $12,
900 for regular salaries and $6000 for
five new deputies. Godchaux also
wanted $27,000 for copying 450.000
folios at 6 cents per folio. Chairman
Brandenstein thoug-ht 5 cents a folio
would be sufficient, which would per
mit copyists to earn $80 per month,
a sum Brandenstein thought was ade
quate pay for the work. The com
mittee practically decided to allow
Godchaux $24,000 for copyists, $6000
for the new deputies and $*12,900 for
regular salaries.
The Supervisors' Finance Commit
tee held a meeting yesterday for the
purpose of hearing the heads of va
rious municipal departments regard
ing their required appropriations for
the next fiscal year.
Tax Collector Smith asked for $34,
900 for regular salaries, in his office,
but agreed to get along with $31,300.
Smith had also asked for $36,000 for
extra clerks, but compromised on
$34,200, out of which he will pay an
expert searcher.
Adoption of the New Text
books by State Board of
Education Requires Action
Superintendent of Schools Langdon
yesterday issued the following circu
lar relative to the proposed revision
of the course of study in the public
schools: v
The adoption of new textbooks by the State
Board of 1-Mucatlon will necessitate some
changes In our course of studyi We deem It
wise at the tame time to make such other
changes as experience demonstrates to be best
for the schools. To this end we shall call
conferences of the teachers of each grade and
of the principals. The teacher of each grade
will know best the details of the work of each
grade, while the principals will know best the
relation of grade to grade. These conferences
are entirely voluntary. Teachers and prin
cipals may attend such conferences as they
tvish. Those attending will be given oppor
tunity to express themselves and those unable
to attend are uruetJ' to send their suggestions
in writing to this office.
That these meetings may be of most service
in the proper modification of the course of
study teachers and principals are requested
to examine 1 the books recently adopted by the
State Board of Education, as follows:
Thomas â Elementary History of the United
States; California â New Grammar School
United States History (McMaster); Tarr &. Mc-
Murry â Home Geography; Redway & Hinman â
Natural Advanced Geography; Hornbrook â

PROBABLE WINNERS.
The contest between Harry Tenney,
the amateur bantam-weight champion,
and Johnny Crowe is attracting a
good deal of attention among those
who are fond of amateur boxing.
Crowe defeated Tenney once and he
believes he can do it again. Tenney,
since he won the championship, has
improved wonderfully, and so has
Crowe, so the result will be watched
with . interest. \ Teddy Wolffe and
"Rough House" McDonald and Joe
Thomas and George Peterson will
meet in the double main event and
both contests are strong attractions.
The rest of the card is: Dick Hyland
vs. Charley Dunn; .Dick Cullen vs.
Billy Duffy; Mike Synfy vs. Young Hc-
Clure; Billy Stuart vs. Billy Shank,
and Tom Sullivan vs. JoePodesto.
Eight boxing contests between some
of the best amateurs on the coast is
what. the San Francisco Athletic Club
offers to-night at Woodward's Pavi
lion. The men are evenly matched
and three of the bouts will decide
championships. As all of the con
testants have posted a forfeit to guar
antee their appearance in the ring it
is not likely any of the bouts adver
tised will have to be substituted.

IX A SERIES OF BOUTS
The athletic , amphitheater in Gold
en Gate Park may be increased in size
to meet the demands that will be put
upon it and a three-quarter mile speed
track with the accompanying addition
of ground space within is probable.
It has been estimated that the cost
will not be greatly, enlarged by the
change of plan and. much benefit will
be derived from it. The increased
space in the infield will allow of a
regulation size oolo field and liberal
financial support has been assured "by
the players of that. game if the Park
Commissioners can be induced to
make the alteration. It would also
give added room for every other sport.
This question will be taken up at the
weekly meeting of the Amateur Driv
ing and Athletic Association to-night,
to which all interested persons are in
vited. Room 1000 in the Palace Ho
tel is the appointed place. V ;;
Another matter of great moment
will be considered. Partial assurance
has been given that the receipt' of
$10,000 in cash at this time would
start the improvement work on the
pleasure grounds, the additional $15,
000 to be paid into the park 'fund
when collected. Expressions of opin
ion are wanted from all members of
the association on this point and a
favorable vote will mean that Super
intendent McLaren will start grading
within a week. *-
The United Railroads added 8500 to
the subscription list' within the week
and several other, ample sums have
gone to Treasurer O'Kane's credit
from various sources. James D.Phe
lan is among the prospective subscrib
ers and, has told' the committee that !
his support; may be 'expected when he
seeahthe athletes' are to be well taken
car"e;of in the plans; of the; amphi
theater. .' On the. point of collecting
small pledges from the , v . school., ath
letes, however, the committee ' has
fduttd a snag. The asking, for money
for any purpose Is tabooed in thepub
liq schools and -special 'consent must
b'e â¢ gained from the proper^authorlties
before ; .thc work ' may, be -prosecuted."

Mlraon second, Monastic II. third. Time, 1:01.
Sixth race, one mile â Give All won. I. Sam
uelson second, Sarilia third. Time, 1:13 3-5.
McBride finished third on Ada' N, the
7 to 5 -favorite for the mile and a fur
long selling affair. He 'found half a
dozen pockets at different stages of the
journey and altogether made a Â¦ poor
job of it. Crosswaite displayed - unex
pected alacrity on Illowaho, a 7 to 1
chance, : 'and after leading throughout
earned a nose* decision over, Golden
Light, the Â» second* choice. Glenrice
ran a fair sort of race.
: Milt Jones"-" useful performer John A.
Scott was looked upon as one of -the real
good - things, on "the* card,'* and,' at the
sea nt price - of 7 Â¦' to 1 ; 10, - was plunged on
to win the five and a half furlong purse
run, fifth to_ be decided/ Â¦ FailWg to dis
play his best form he 'finished ' third in
an .-, exciting nose and Â¦ short head ) fin
ish - with 'Louis â¢ Wagner." and . Royal
Rogue. - The winner f - -Louis -Wagner,
T. McLaughlin's smart filly Sea Air,
piloted by Jones, received heavy back
ing at 8 to 5 to take the two-year-old
dash over four and a half furlongs,
which she annexed without great effort.
In front almost from the start, the
daughter" of Pirate of Penzance led
Sileo out "three lengths. , The latter
closed strongly, downing Squire John
son, a 100 to 1 shot, half a length for
the place.
ILLOWAHO A -WINNER.
Headwater was up to his old tricks
again in the opening event. As the
barrier was released he swerved to
ward the rail and not only got left
himself, but prevented Flyer, the
mount of Jones, from getting , away.-
Fair Lady Anna, a well played 7 to 1
shot, with Crosswaite up, beat Marelio
out a head in a driving finish at the
wire. Oscar Tolle ran a fair third.
Titus, the post favorite, had speed, but
failed to stay the route.
The favorite had a world of speed
and, making the Â¦ pace from the jump,
was hard pressed later on though, to
dispose of Joe Lesser in a driving fin
ish. Gateway tired the last sixteenth,
running a moderate 'third.
Business is brisk in the betting ring
as the season draws to a close and the
layers are kept busy. Favorites cap
tured three races and as the other
three winners, Fair Lady Anna, Illo
waho and Louis Wagner, were not
overlooked, the talent fared well.
; HEADWATER ACTS BADLY.
Johnny Schorr's three-year-old An
anias, ridden by Reed, captured the
mile and a hundred yard handicap at
Oakland yesterday and reduced the
Coast record of 1:46% for the distance
to . 1:45%. The betting" favored the
Schorr entry, for, with his impost of 9'j
pounds, he closed a 14 to 5 favorite,
with the remaining play distributed
about on the chances of Joe Lesser,
Gateway and Caronal. %
had Vickery in the saddle and the
Ryan jockey rode the shortest race,
hugging the rail on the stretch turn,
saving where both Kelly and Jones
lost ground.
At the weights. Forest King looked
far the best of the seven starters in
the last, a mile and fifty-yard sell
ing number. Heavily played at
even money, the Oregon horse scored
cleverly at the end from Laocoon and
G. W. Trahern.
Crosswaite piloted two winners.
Sinnott, who rode Estado in the first
race, was suspended by the judges for
his seeming lack of interest in what
was transpiring."
The Antrim stable lost Ada N from
the third event. The mare was enterea
to be sold for $400 and was claimed by
J. Guthrie, owner of Glenrice.

STANFORD UNIVERSITY, May 4.â
Although Stanford athletes will not be
allowed to compete in the Mo'tt Haven
games at Philadelphia this year, the
Stanford track men will get a trip East
and will take part in the Western
intercollegiate field meet, which will
be held- on Marshall Field, Chicago,
The eyes of the Eastern men are
already on the Cali'fornians, owing to
the performances ..of Ralph Rose, . the
shot putter, and of Dole of - Stanford,
who holds the world's record for the
pole vault. An Eastern writer says of
Rose when he made his wonderful ef
fort on Franklin field: .
It was Michigan again, at a foregone con
dition, when Rope began to put the' shot. Th!Â«
young n:an v.as distinctly, sensational. He
looked as tÂ»ic as he had been described. Hahn,
Ms team mate, miÂ«ht have been his little boy
on his way to kindergarten. Rose stood In <*
casual rroup of. what pa?s for full-grown men,
De Witt. KhÂ«;vlir. and G!a c s, and he seemed to
look over their h^ads. This terrific bulk of
muscle was topped by an apple-cheeked boyiith
face, fcs good-natured and full of expression as
a custara pi*. Rose Â¦ showed there was no
Western hyperbole In the accounts of his her
culean prowess. He pushed the shot with no
apparent struggle a distance of 4S feet 2 inches,
equaling the world's record of Dennis Horgati
of Ireland. Then he unklnked his biceps again
and put Dennis Horzan on the ehelf as a back
number, making a new world'* record of 48
feet .'I 1 ., inc.'if f. although it will not stand
officially, bt-ceusr it was made as an exhibition
put- With the hammer Rose was not so for
midable. He was beaten' by three men. but
it was memorable hammer throwing, as each
of theee four threw more than 152 feet. De
Witt, tht Intercollegiate champion, took first
with a throw â¢ of 158 feet 3*i Inches, with
Shevlin four feet behind him.
California will be more numerously
and.morc ably represented on the ath
letic fields and the cinder paths of the
East thfs season than every before.
The Pacific Athletic Association will
send a picked team to the Olympian
games at St. Louis, Stanford Univer
sity will send a' team to the Western
intercollegiate championships at Chi
cago, while other athletes will -go -on
their own responsibility.
These men form the strongest team
that has ever represented Stanford on
the track, and they should better their
coast records in the East. The men will
be' taken East early, so that they can
accustom themselves to the new con
ditions. â¢
June 4. This was decided to-day when
the news was received that Stanford
would be eligible to the Chicago meet.
Eight men will be taken from here, in
cluding Dole, world's champion pole
vaulter; Hyde, coast champion shot
putter; Dunn, coast champion quarter.

"WTira the natives finished swinging
their dabs in the first round yesterday
Â¦t Kecrcjitlon Part they had accumu
lated tbe comfortable total of five
runs. They never approached the plate
tigaln. bat at tfcat It was uselrss. for
those Sve carried them throngh nicely.
Si-orÂ«: San Francisco a, LoÂ« Angeles 4.
It was certain!?- a warm flve min
utes tor the rhaprfy Mr. Wheeler. In
fact, he got on* or the prlie beatings
Â«Â»f the year. Hildebrand and Waldron
Â«*ac!i tore off one, ileaay sacrificed and
Jnvin walked, making a full house.
.A'ong one c!d IÂ«y Gorton with a
-tirive out to left field. Hilde and Wal
dron tore across the rubber, Irwin
nadr for third aad Gorton for second.
Flood finally got the ball and threw
it wild to the plate In an endeavor to
out off n run. Irwin landed safely and
<Tortcn west to third. Then Massey
kicked through with another nice one
SLH<i Gorton Ian Jed. Anderson also had
one waiting which brought Big Bill in
and here the !ocals halted for the bal
aflre of the same.
ThÂ»Â» Anjrels Etarted off well also by
bringing in two in tbÂ« first inning on
liits by Bernard and Cravath and An
Â«!ersor/s error. They got another in
the ihlrd on a double steal and did
nothing more til! the ninth rolled
around.
Then ft Jooked like one of those old
lime lightning finishrs for a moment.
Â«"ravath singled and likewise Chase.
Toman bit along the third base line
Â«tnd Cravath arrived nicely. Chase also
tried to turn tbe trick, but he was
nailed at the rubber and a stormy
scene of kicking and yelling followed.
Eagar was sent in to take a crack at
the bell 1n Hall's stead, but he had no
kit in his bat. so it was all off. The

j NEW YORK, May 4.â There was an
excellent get-away programme at
Jamaica this afternoon, with a special
drawing feature in the first appearance
this season of McChesney. The card
otherwise was interesting, the Corona,
a selling stake, being the feature. The
weather was charming and the track
in grand condition. The excellence of
the card proved a potent factor, for it
drew out a splendid attendance, which
was rather surprising in view of the
fact that, there is^a big day coming
to-morrow at Westchester, when the
Metropolitan handicap is to be run.
McChesney's debut was not pleasing.
He was made a warm favorite at S to
6. He broke last, , but seemed to have
no speed and Hildebrand finally de
sisted and* let him gallop home behind
the others. Collector Jcssup broke in
.front and opened up a >rin of several
leDgths on Rosetint and Fustian, which
were second and third. They ran this
wny throughout. Collector Jessup won
easily by a length and a half from
Rosetint, which was the same distance
in front of Fustian.
De Reszke, at odds of 13 to 5, won
the Corona stake, after a hard drive
tbrough the stretch with Akela. Only
one favorite won during the afternoon.
Summary:
NEW YORK. May 4.â Jamaica results r

PORTLAND. May 4. â Butler had
two bad innings at the beginning of
to-day's game. Timely and bunched
batting by Ganley. Francka, Graham
and Schafley was responsible for
three runs in the first. Lohman start
ed the slugging in the second and
Kruger's single brought in two men.
Then Moskiman came home on Gra
ham's two-bagger. Schmidt had trou
bles in the third, when Portland made
four hits and three runs. He allowed
but one single after that No Port

- The California State building at the
Louisiana Purchase Exposition, at St.
,lkÂ»uis. stands on a hill, in a conspicuous
position, near the center of the Exposl
,'tjon icrounds. While there are many re
..mfrkable buildinps that will attract the
* -nt fen t ion of Bullions of visitors while
the Exposition gates are open, there is
- not o:i<? U;at has more Intrinsic interest
than the California building.
It is a reproduction, with great fidelity
j:o detail, of the famous Santa Barbara
Mission. To mako the reproduction per
fect Â¦ the front has bern chipped and
f-tain^d and grass seeds have been sown
" bptTvtr-*-n t!ie flagstone pavements, that
the ravages of timp and the characteris

SamueJ SCewsom, the architect of the
buildinp. Visited Santa Barbara several
linu-p and made a study of the garden,
as well as of the building and Its sur

Every Californian will wish to have a

The California State structure stands
.roxt to- the Illinois State building, and
the Fraternal Hall and Temple Ir.n are
its neighbors. Not far away is the great

gardens.
The California building has a facade

Among the Acapulco's passengers
was Adolfo Meyer, president of the
Quezaltenango railroad. Joseph Z.
Dye, superintendent of the Darlen
mines, also returned on the liner.
, J. C Wilson, mate of the Colon, mar
ried one of the liner's passengers at
San Jose de. Guatemala two days be
fore the Colon was wrecked. Mrs. Wil
son, who was formerly Mrs. Schmld,
wife of a local artist, returned on the
Acapulco with her sailor husband.
The Acapulco's passengers .included
the flowing named:
Vincent Garland. MUs -Agnes Oariand. Mies
Gertrude Garland. Joseph Z. Dye, Miss Julia
Frazer. Francis W. Mark. General Lleandro

cilia Ramlre*.
Among her passengers was Francis
W. Mark, British Consul at Valparaiso.
He tried to go ashore at Champerico,
but was turned back by the authorities.
Purser Thompson says the gross Ignor
ance of the Guatemalan military au
thorities was responsible for Mark's
l)clng excluded, but the Acapujco's pas
sengers declare that Mark's caustic and
freely expressed criticisms of the Gua
temalan Government made on board
to all who would listen had . been re
ported to the authorities, who decided
that the Consul was a good man to
keep out of the country.
Mark said yesterday that it was
a "mere trifle."
The Acapulco's departure from Pana
ma was delayed by a strike among the
dock laborers and the liner left the
Isthmus in ballast- Two days after her
departure the strike was settled. She
brought 1123 tona of cargo, which In
cluded 9000 bags of coffee and 700 bags
of BUgrar.
"Aie Acapulco sails again for Panama
et noon, Monday next. Stevedores
worked all last night discharging her
cargo and this morning she will go
on the drydock to be cleaned and
painted. ;.-.* :
The Pacific Mail Company's steam
ship Acapulco. Captain W. J. Russell,
arrived yesterday, from Panama with
the crew of the wrecked liner Colon on
board. Captain Irvine and Second Of
ficer Thompson remained at Acfijutla
with the wreck: Captatn Irvine to look
out for the interests of the underwrit
ers and Thompson as representative of
the Pacific Mall Company. All the rest
of the ship's company came home on
the Acapulco.
The officers of the wrecked steam
ship have little to add to the details al
ready published. The vessel struck
twice and was hopelessly damaged
from the start. When she reached the
beach her engines were moving slowly,
her fires being out and the steam near
ly all spent. Before she was beached
the water in her hold was eleven feet
deep and the vessel was far down by
the head and rapidly sinking. All on
board landed without much difficulty.
The wrecked passengers continued the
trip on the Barracouta.

Decide That He Was to

Captain Bert Lee of the steamer.Ful
ton was" censured and -punished yes
terday by' United . States Local Inspec
tors Bolles and Bulger for running;
short of fuel and stranding the stearn
er at Poet Orf ord on ; February ' 11, of
this year. , Captain Lee's license as Â«
master and was suspended, for
three months^ .In their report the In
spectors say:- . Â¦Â¦Â¦
All on board except Ihe -eecond.. mat- were'
landed safely. The second mate was. killed by
the boat capsizing, and from being. struck by
a piece of timber.' 'Before leaving Portland
Captain Lee ', was informed by., the chief en- j
gineer there was only four and a half dayt
fuel on board, and that. If the weather should
be as bad on the trip to San FrancUco , as I
it had been en- the up trip to Portland there
was not enough . fuel on board to reach San j
Francisco." Captain Le<T thought the weather
would be good and the steamer "would make
San Francisco., all, right. ...
From the time the steamer Fultoa left the
Columbia Rivera until she . anchored at Port ;
Orford it was two days and .twenty hours and.
as before stated, she, had then only six hours';
fuel on board.s Captain. Lee. says he passed.
Coos Bay about ten miles oft On the. morning,
of February 6, and. at that time 'the 'wind was
light with Â« heavy westerly swell, \ .
After a careful consideration of the evidence i
In this case* we are of the opinion that Cap
tain B. Lee, was negligent, in. leaving' the Co
lumbia River, as he did,: with so â¢ email aft ,
â¢mount of fuel. on the, vessel, more- especially
at a season 'of the. year when, heavy, south
east and southwest gak-s are prevalent on the
coast; and that, he was unskillful. -In not. try- I
ing to get the steamer into Coos 'Bay. which,
is a safe, harbor. Instead, of. Port Orford, an,
open port exposed to. southerly -winds and sea.
For reason of Bilch ; negligence, and unsklll
fulness we have" thjo date suspended his li
cense as master^and pilot for. three months.
We take occasion to remark that. In - our
opinion, had fuel' or. assistance l>een * sent ' to.
the steamer Fulton as sponas her condition
wa; known at San Francisco the vessel would
not have been wrecked. : % , (

THE FUTURE REVEALED. THE PAST
DISCLOSED.
The Present Analyzed by Livingstone.
PROF. LIVINGSTONE'S readings are like
a living pare of Klammarion's treatise that is
so electrifying the world to-day. He is no
lmitatDi-. His work In uuon original lines,
pure thought, clear vision. He telte you what
you dsslrc to know and works in the open
light.
He la as conspicuous for his wonderful occult
analysis as he in for his original expression
and vivid truthfulness.
A teÂ«st reading is not a life reading. When
you call on PROF. LIVINGSTONE he wilt
give you a fult life reading for $1. A test
Is cf little value; when the mind Is troubled
you need more substantial aid and advice.
This Is just what PROF. LIVINGSTONE
glws you wntn you call on him for a first-
class clairvoyant reading.
He .asks you no questions, but tells you
what you wish to know.
He does not mention all the Ills and mis-
fortunes ycu are hMr to. You are acquainted
with the facts in your case. Let PROF. LIV-
INGSTONE analyze the matters that are
troubling you, find the cause of trouble and
suggest the remÂ«dy.

The Wood. Wire and Metal Lathers'
Union jrave its first annual entertain
ment and ball last night at Native
Sons* Hall. An excellent programme
Â¦was enjoyed by a large audience.
Entertainment of Union.
Attorney George D. Collins says,
"There'll be something doing in Judge
Cook's'court at noon, and it doesn't re
quire' a weather prophet to sniff .the
storm, either."
It would be a novel spectacle to see
a Police Commissioner doing penance
in jail for thirty days, but it is pre
dicted that such a denouement Is not
unlikely, if . he should be found guilty
of contempt' of Judge Cooh's injunc
tion.
By consent the contempt proceedings
against Policemen Davids and - Barry
for violating the injunction twice by
arresting Beulah Williams after she
had left the i-estaurant some days ago
and by visiting the premises after the
appointment of Hutton as special
chief last Tuesday morning at 2 o'clock
by climbing to the ,roof of 1125 Dupont
street, descending by, means of a lad
der and scaling walls and fences were
continued till this morning. The ar
gument on the writs of habeas corpus
for the release of Fannie Guoet and
Rosie Smith, arrested by Orr and Keo
hane early Monday morning at Dupont
and Washington streets, was continued
till May 9 by consent.
Collins said the argument would only
take a few minutes. The only question
was whether the police entered the
premises and he thought that would
not be denied.
"They are entitled to a reasonable j
continuance," remarked the Judge,
"and the case may go over until the
noon hour to-morrow."
Just then Hutton marched In with
the pomp belonging to his new title.
Eyeing Hutton, the Judge said: "If
I find that this injunction has been
violated I shall deal severely with
those who have violated it and
with any, if any there be, who
have advised policemen to disregard
the orders of a Superior Court. I want
to say right here, also, that if I find
that the Injunction has been violated 1
shall make no mere pro forma order,
but the guilty will have occasion to re
member the lesson. The orders of this
court must be obeyed." .<
COLLINS SEES TROUBLE.
Attorney Collins replied that he Lad
no objection to a continuance if a
promise were given not to violate the
injunction by entering the premises,
otherwise he would insist upon Im
mediate hearing.
"I would willihglv give the promise,"
replied Harris, "but I cannot tie the
hands of the police."
When the contempt proceedings were
called shortly after the noon hour As
sistant District Attorney Harris. asked
for a continuance till this morning as
he had been unable to prepare himself
for the argument.
Attorney George D. Collins is after
the injunction violators and he notified
Judge Cook yesterday morning of the
actions of the two officers. The Judge
made an order citing them to appear
before him at the noon hour to show
cause why they should not be punished
for contempt of court.
cook eyes hxtttox.
There's something new in the courts
and Police . Commissioner H. ; TV.
Hutton is in hot water. Judge
Cook is indignant that his injunction
restraining policemen from interfering
with the business of Jean Pon should
have been ignored and Hutton is un
der suspicion. To-day it will be de
cided'whether Hutton as special chief
of police for the disorderly house back
of 1129 Dupont street was In contempt
of court.
Presumably acting under the Dupont
street chief's orders Policemen Orr and
Keohane are said to have climbed to
the roof of 605 Broadway, which over
looks the houses back of Pon's res
taurant. They had provided them
selves with a rope which they tied
to the chimney and slid down it to the
premises after they had " taken obser
vations from their elevated position.
They arrested four of the women In
matesâFannie Gouet, Felicie Libert,
Rachel Martin and Lrazie Daschâ and
when informed that they were violat
ing the injunction it is alleged that
they replied "To with the'injunc
tion."
The work of impaneling a jury for
Soeder*a trial was continued before
Judge Cook yesterday. Slow progress
was made, only three more being se
cured. They are: Emeric Fournier,
682 San Jose avenue: Oscar Waibel,
517 Capp street, and John C Adels
dorffer, -1605 Gough street. This makes
ten with the seven passed on Monday.
Several of the talesmen did not an
swer to their names, and the Judge
ordered attachments issued against
them to appear this morning.
You have lied to us and promised htm that
he would make In America plenty of monry.
and so you have "dragged" my dear husband
to America to lay him there on the slaughter
table. If you bad told us that you had served
three years In the State prison my dear hus
band would certainly have not gone with you
to America, because you know that we have
not been raised to steal and rob. Our poor
mother has raised us good and to be honest,
and now she has to live and see a burglar and
murderer running at large In the world. Sine*
the 28th of January we have been sick. TVÂ»
cannot forgive the misery and suffering that
you have caused us.
We think tf you have been the murderer of
my husband, then may God and the judges
give you the punishment for It. or have you
no faith any more? Don't you believe any
more In God? If you 'have done It. confess
and reveal what you havw done and pray to
our beloved God fcr forgiveness. And now I
am here alone with my poor three little children
and have no property and no one any more to
give us a piece of bread. We pray that you
redeem yourself to God.
WIDOW JOSEPH BLAISE.
T>. S. : You wrote me that my poor husband
had been killed, and row I have learned from
the papers that you yourself are the possible
murderer of my husband. You came to G<"t
many and you have deceived us all. and you
told my husband If you'd take Â«Lxty (60) dolUra
along: to America they would have In eight
days pood work, and now I see that you could
not even find work for my husband. Did you
come to Germany to burden our poor old
mother, myself and my poor three children with
misery and suffering? I and my dear husband
have lived Â«o happy and contented together
and he had no need to leave, for America.
The police have a pitiful letter s?nt
by the widow of Joseph Blaise to her
brother, Leon Soedcr, who is accused
of murdering Blai3e on January 10
at Taylor and Vallejo street?. The
letter was sent to M. Meinberg, 4S0O
Mission street, with the request that
he deliver it to Soeder, but instead
he handed it over to the police. It
arrived here on March 11. It is
written in German, but has been

Joe Williams, a natty octoroon,
convinced Judge Mogan that it was
Trixie Moore, also chocolateTcplored,
and she alone that disturbed' the noc
turnal peace of the Barbary Coast by
hurling empty beer bottles through the
window of a dwelling at Broadway and
Pinckney place.
"Jes happened teh be dah, dat wuz

He was dismissed and Miss Moore will
be tried on May 10.
While "scrapping" with Louis Lu
chetti In the Spreckels Market last
Tuesday afternoon A. K. Hildebrand
fell and broke his collar bone and
Judge Mogan thought the fracture was
sufficient punishment for disturbing
the peace. Mr. Luchetti was also dis
missed with a reprimand.
"I'm glad you have this case, Judge,"
said Frances Lopez, vagrant, to his
Honor Fritz, "for I'm sick and tired of
being sent up by Mogan. Why, I
wasn't out of jail one day after do
ing six months when he gave me six
months more. I've heard of you and
I'm pleased to meet you."
"Pleasure's mutual. When did your
last sentence expire?"
"Two weeks ago."
"Well, that isn't so bad; and to show
that this court appreciates endeavor to
reform I'll give you only thirty days."
"Thank you many times."
"Oh, once Is enough."
Judge Cabaniss held Paul, Loudick
for assault with a deadly weapon in
$Â£000 and William McLaughlin for rob
bery, in $3000, to the Superior Court.
Julius Cotin shrugged surprise when
Judge Mogan fined him $10 for smash

"But, sare," Julius expostulated, "eet

David Ferguson said it -was not per

spired him to purloin a small mirror
from a saloon at Twenty-fourth and
Hampshire streets.
"I believe your statement, David,"
said Judge Mogan, "for it Is substan

there is nothing in your appearance to
indicate that in sobriety you would do
anything else with a mirror than
shun it. Go. home and keep sober."
"Guilty â sentence to-morrow! Not

fact, I obtained it â In a Pacific-street
dance hall."
"To do whatâ play a slide trom
bone?"
"Yes. sir."
"That, was an unsoldlerly way. to
treat a comrade." said the Judge,
"and offsets at least one of the con
siderations of favor you have claimed.
What business had you on the Bar
bary Coast, anyway?"
- "Previous good character Is al
ways worth something to a defendant
in this court," said his Honor, "and
an ex-soldier, never fails to arouse our
jiatriotic sympathy. The fact that
you deserted your country's service
cannot be ignored, however, nor can
we entirely overlook your exceptional
value in that service, which made
yourdesertlon all the more reprehen
sible. In, front of the enemy a man
who manipulates a slide trombone is
equal, I am sure, to a score of men
ordinarily armed. Regiments that
would unfalteringly face a battery of
Catlings could be stampeded by a
slide trombone properly directed.
However, let us hear the charge
against you before considering your
plea for leniency."
The charge was that 'on the night
of Tuesday last. Mr. Shannon picked
up on the Barbary Coast a former
comrade named Wilkinson, who was
deeply inebriated, and th'at after es
corting Mr. Wilkinson to that gen
tleman's room in a Broadway lodging
house Mr. Shannon departed with all
the clothing he could find in the
apartment, leaving Mr. Wilkinson with
nothing to wear except a hat with a
hole In its crown, a faded silken neck
tie and a celluloid collar. Arrest
quickly followed.
Standing rigidly at "attention,"
chest protruding and shoulder
blades colliding as he breathed, Frank
L. Shannon told the story of his life
to Judge Mogan.
"I was an army musician," he be
gan, "playing the slide trombone In
an infantry band, when the tyranny
of a superior in rank drove me to
revolt, then to desertion to escape
punishment. But I was captured and
the punishment came â fifteen months'
hard labor on Alcatraz. As a former
defender of my country am I not en
titled to some leniency at your
hands?"
"This court's functions do not extend
to the investigation of hearsay," dryly
remarked Judge Fritz, "and as the law
excludes complaint based solely upon
hearsay I am compelled to dismiss Mr
Doe."
Patrolman McNamara had only
heard that a certain member of the nu
merous Doe family was a vagrant and
saloon loafer, and it was upon that in
formation that the arrest v. as made..
"It wasn't drink that ailed mÂ»," she
pleaded, "but the warm v/eather. I
guess I was sunstruck."
V'The same sort of solar prostration
has more than once affected you in
midwinter," said his Honor, "and Mag
gie Flaws, whose surname is a true in
dex to her character, will be sent to
jail for as long a term as the law al
lows me to send her."
Six months in the County Jail will be
ordered for Maggie Flaws when ?*he
appears for sentence to-day before
Judge Mogan. She is an old offender
in the line 'of mendicancy and drunk
enness, and was last arrested for heap
ing oral abuse upon women who Ig
nored her appeal for alms as she stag
gered in inebriety at Fourth and Fol
som streets.
The case was continued till to-mor
row, by which time, the ' court will
probably have ascertained which of
Mr. Cole's pleas is entitled ,to most
credence.
Alameda's reputation for law and
order received a severe jolt from one
of its residents, I. T. Cole, who assev
erated that he considered the carrying
of a concealed weapon essential to the
preservation of his life and property
from highwaymen in the village across
the bay.
But a different excuse was made by
Mr. Cole to the policeman who arrested
him for packing a revolver on com
plaint of a member of the Sheet Metal
Workers' Union. Mr. Cole, it seems,
was once enrolled In that organization,
and since he severed his connectlcn
with it he has made threats to kill any
of his former associates who, should In
terfere with him. Hence tha complaint
and the arrest of Mr. Cole as he was
about to board the ferry-boat for his
home In Alameda. He told the orBcer
that he carried the pistol beeausa he
had heard of a conspiracy to cast him
overboard.' It was to Judge Mogan he
made the statement anent his fÂ»ar of
being waylaid and robbed in the town
where his home Is.
* * *
Judge Fritz dismissed the charge of
battery which had been hanging over
Dr. Bruce Klmmis for a month. The
complaining witness was the defend
ant's crippled wife, who appeared on
crutches at the first hearing of the
case and then disappeared with her
young child and has baffled police pur
suit ever since.
Suddenly missing his watch, and be
lieving he had been robbed of it, James
D. Courtney, proprietor of a Third
street saloon, blew a whistle so loudly
as to awaken all the sleepers within a
three-block radius of Larkin and Mc-
Allister streets at 1:30 o'clock Tuesday
morning. Special Policeman Cottle
was the first peace guardian to re
spond and after he had silenced the
tympanum cracking solo and heard Mr.
Courtney's story he took that gentle
man In tow and went cruising for a
clew. He found one in the firjl liquor
store he visited, for there Mr. Court
ney had pledged his timepiece for a
dollar and then drank the incident into
oblivion.
Judge Mogan dismissed the charge
of drunkenness against Mr. Courtney
and gratuitously advised him to con
fine his future nocturnal orgies to his
own precinct. \
Edward Davis thought that James
Kelljr was only. joking when he com
manded Davis to hold "up his hands,
and Mr. Davis did not accept the sit
uation seriously until he found that
Mr. Kelly had actually robbed him of
some money. A charge of robbery
against Kelly failed of proof, however,
but the prosecuting attorney of Judge
Fritz's court immediately filed an ac
cusation of grand larceny and believes
he can make it adhere.
A wagonload of juvenility had lots
of fun with a circus procession on Mar-,
ket street last Tuesday, but Thomas
McDpnough, the man who drove the
wagon, was arrested for disturbing the
peace and will be heard on May 10 by
Judge Mogan.
The complaining witness, a circus at
tache of unquestioned veracity, has al
ready testified that the youngsters in
the McDonough wagon, instead of
treating the zoological features of the
parade with thecourtesy due to strang
ers in a strange land, pelted a highly
dignified dromedary with stones and
other missiles, scoffed at the sacred
cow from Abyssinia, jeered at the only
gaspergoo in captivity, twitted the ele
phant on the dlminutiveness of his rear
appendage and made greater monkeys
of themselves <han the caged simians
whom they tormented. \ . i'r
Mr. McDonough sidesteps responsibil
ity for the actions of his cargo of mis
chievous adolescence. He says that be
tween preventing his frightened horses
from bolting and reviewing the pageant
his attention was fully occupied.
charge against Mr. Burg fell to pieces
when Anna blushingly confessed that
his relationship with her was estab
lished without benefit of clergy. s.

STOCK MARKET.
CHICAGO. May 4.â With an inclination to
weakness, the wheat market opened at a slight
decline, July being down ty^c to Y*c at 84Vi
@&3%c. Fine weather everywhere and the
fact that spring seeding was proceeding rap-
Idly were the principal â¢ contributors to the
bearish sentiment. A rumor that crop reports
or Michigan. Missouri and Ohio would show a
moderate Improvement In condition* of grow
ing wheat increased the selling pressure. Talk
of a possible general tie-up of lake navigation
also had some bearish influence. ' The selling
was quite general for a time and In conse
quence price* continued to decline, July going
down to 84VÂ»C. But sentiment gradually un
derwent a change. With only light offerings,
the price of July wheat advanced to S.'.c. Dur
ing the last half hour there was considerable
profit taking, which carried prices back about
He. The market closed firm with July at 84%
<rS4%c. â¢ - --
A f ter - exhibiting .Mme weakness early, the
corn market closes strong. July closed 9ic
higher at 49^Â©48>4c. . \
Small receipts and an active cash demand
were Influences that created strength In oats.
The- market closed strong with July at 39c- '
Buying by shorts and packers caused a firm
tone In provisions. Pork closed â¢ 10c > higher;
lard and ribs were up 7%c each.

Harrison's c!rcu'.2r says:
"Since the departure of ahe steamship Ven
tura there have been the following; arrivals
of Australian Coal frÂ«m Newcastle, viz: W.
H. Smith, 24 1Â» tons; Ilfur*. 2448 tons; Sea
King, 2170 tons; Melanope. 224U tons; total.
0285 tons. These cargoes came to hand very,
opportunely, as the yards here- wer* almost en
tirely bare of stock. There are 2$ coal car
riers now engaged for this port with a carry-
Ing capacity of about T-'J.COO tons; six of those
are fully due. Prices remain steady, although
there U a slight shading off for late deliveries.
Shipments from the northern coast are being
freely made and are offered at prices which
It is difficult for colonial coals to compete
with, more especially such grades as are utll
l^'i for steam purposes. Fuel oil still holds
Its sway and is finding ready sale at ruling
rates. Our principal railroad companies are
confining themselves almost exclusively to the
uce of oil. each month diminishing theif con
sumption'of coal for fuel. The quantity of
oil being refined Is laryely being Increased.
There Is a marked falling off In the demand
for house purposes owing to the warmer weath
er. It Is anticipated that within a short time
the brisk competition now existing among our
wholesale dealers will be checked, thus assur
ing them more profitable business."

over the maximum quotations. A drawer of
'Raspberries from across the bay sold for

The Orange market had a little better tone.
as receipts were lighter than .usual on auction
day, and there was a better demand from
some quarters. The trade was running largely
on email sizes and purchased â¢ more- on' size
than on quality. -In the auction rooms, where
the attendance was large, desirable sizes of

the latter were largely nominal in price.' The
steamer from Oregon brought down 7127 sack*,

In time to be sold. New Potatoes were very
weak at unchanged rates and some dealers
were offering old and poor lota below the quo

light and concentrated in a few hands and
prices had another sharp advance. Other
ycltow Onions were in small supply and largely

Asparagua was steady under moderate receipts
and a good consumptive and canning demand.
The canners paid 4Â«-jc for No. 2 and 5c per

for Alarnetla County stock. San Jose lots met
with a better inquiry, but shared in the gen
eral weakness and some dealers were making
liberal cor.ctaaion* In order to clean up. Offer

NEW YORK. May 4. â The counterpoise cf
weakness in 'the United States Steel itock<
agairsl strength in Union Pacific had the
effect of holding the general market in_ a
ptate of practical immobility to-<Jaj\ The
general movement was narrower and the mar
ket more neglected than at any time since
the present iieriod of dullness set in. Both
of the, United States Steel stocks touched the
lowest price on the present reaction, the com
mon getting Delow 10 and the preferred be
low 55. The second* mortgage bonds were re
actionary. The disruption of the Bessemer
Orr Association was the assigned cause of tne
celling and there was large transactions in
the preferred at different times. ThÂ» obvious
oauso ff Â«he advance in Union Pacific w*jÂ»
thÂ«? giving out of a statement by the head of
tho system expressing hopeful views of the
business outlook, especially through the West.
This statement was regarded by hopeful
traders as an Intimation of a purpose to offer
general fupnorl to th* markÂ«*-Â«nd was of
little influence on sentiment. The attitude
' of the market, however, was strictly a waiting
I one. The laree subscriptions to the New i'ork
municipal bond isiue created a favorable nn
pret-Kion, being accepted as an index of genuine
abundance of capital resources. But the with
holding of investment from the railroad b-ind
market argues a distrust on the part of cap
ital that leaves little hope for improvement
!n the market for stocks before the bond mar
ket revives. The progress of the gold move
ment was viewed with equanimity, the day's
rncaceinents of $1,750,000 for export to Paris
bringing the week'* total up to $J,750.0iK>.
while tht? *ub-tr*a*ury paid out to-day $3,275.

light stocks and a firm market, but say that
the abundance of green feed Is checking any
further advance at tho moment. Hay continues
weak and freely offered, though receipts are
no longer, excessive.
- The Hay circular of Somers & Co. eays:
'Total arrivals for the week Just ended show
some little Increase over the week preceding.
2850 tons, aa comparing with 2700; the demand
has be*n exceedingly quiet -and about half this
qunntity would Have well supplied the market.
Under such a' condition of affairs It can be
easily . understood how depressed the market
has been. All receivers of Hay have been
struggling to dispose of" their consignments,
and it has been a steady matter of cutting
prices in order to effect sales. The last day
or two show lighter arrivals, and if this will
continue thera will certainly be -some reaction
in the situation.
"The continued showers are still aiding the
growing crop as well as deferring the date for
harvesting. Country stocks are certainly very
much depleted, and if new Hay is kept from
the market 1 until well into June there will be
absolutely nothing carried over.
"We have no features of any importance to
report concerning our local ' market. Shipping
trade has been exceedingly dull, the plentiful
supply of grass all along â¢ the coast having
greatly diminished orders from coastwise
points; trade with the Hawaiian Islands has
alrr. b?en very quiet, all of. which has helped
depress the market here. Â«Â¦
"Choice wheat Hay is not In very plentiful
â¢upply. the majority of present arrivals being
good grades of wheat and wheat and oat."

A remarkable Journey across the con
tinent was completed bx a mere babe
of a boy yesterday when little 5-year
old Frederick Eugene Coggsill arrived
at the Oakland mole, where his anxious
father met the young traveler.
The child made the long trip from
Philadelphia in the care of conductors,
with a tag on his arm. At the end of
his travels strangers delivered the tot
into the arms of the anxious
father, who had not seen the boy
since he was aÂ»year old. Circumstances
compelled the trip without other es
cort than that of train people, and its
successful culmination is a tribute to
modern railroading. The child was the
pet and favorite of passengers all along
the route. Â¦ " 1 .
The story of the little fellow's trip is
best told In his own language:
I had a very nice trip across the continent
My uncle put me on the train at Philadelphia!
I had a tourist ticket and sleeper all the Â¦way
through. When I got on the train at Chicago
th* conductor took me Into the bis Pullman
sleeper and 1 stayed there until I sot j, ere
They were all v*ry kind to me, and the con
ductors and porters all treated me as If I was
their own little boy. Of course, Â¦ It was hard
for me to recoiroire my father when I ifot here
as I had- not seen him since 1 was a year old'
I am just S year* old. I can epell my name!
My fln-t name is Fred, and my second name is
Frederick Eug-ene Corg-slll. I can undress my
self, but I did not take off all my clothes when
I went to *!o.-p on thÂ« train. 1 took off my
coat, ehirt. pants and boots, and left on my
underclothes. I thought there might be a
railroad accident. The conductors wanted to
drriÂ«s n.e in the mornlntr. but I can dreES my
self. I can wash myself, too, and I washed
myself every morning. I am glad to be here
with my father, but ! was very sorry to say
Soo<J-by to the conductors and porters, be
caure they took such good fare of me. I went
into tht? dlnlng-car for my meals. The con
ductor had the money to pay for them. I Â«n
hear the whistles now. I like traveling on thÂ»
trains. -,"
A- H. Coggsill. the father, who is
connected with the West Coast Wire
and Iron Works, was overjoyed to re
ceive his little boy, whom he had not
seen since he was a year old. He said
he could not praise too highly the man
ner in. which the different railroad
companies and the men in their em
ploy had looked after the little chap.
The child left Philadelphia on the
Lehigh VaJley Grand Trunk line and
at Chicago was carried to the Chicago,
Milwaukee and St. Paul â¢ train and
thence came on here via the Union and
Southern Pacific railroads. He was
tagged through, and was placed in
charge of the railroad company.
Wor.g Leorg Guey, adjudged by
United States Commissioner E. H.
Heacork to be a native born citizen of
the United States and entitled as such
io re-enier the United States, was ef
fectually barred out yesterday by a
decision of United States District
Judg* de Haven- The Judge's ruling
.was in accordance with a decision of
th* United States Supreme Court
handed down a little more than a
wppk ago to the effect that a Chinese
immigrant denied a landing is not
entitled to a writ of habeas corpus
yntil he shall have taken an appeal to
the Secretary of the department. The
custom has been heretofore to grant
writs of habeas corpus only to Chi
nese claiming to be American citizens,
who havf be^n denied a landing by
th* United States Immigrant Commis
eioner. without going through the for
mality of an appeal to the Secretary.
3n other cases the appeal has been re
quired and writs of habeas corpus
have not beÂ«*n issued.
The Supreme Court decision re-
Quires that Chinese claiming to be
.American citizens must comply with
the provisions of thp exclusion act and
appeal to the Secretary before resort
ing to th* court and that this appeal
must b* taken within five days after
havins b<>en denied a landing by the
bureau.
After Judgr* de Haven had rendered
his decision Attorney Frank V. Bell
filed a motion asking that the order
he sÂ»Â»t aFtde and that Wong be allow
ed to land. Mr. Bell explains that his
client did appeal to the Secretary of
the Department of Commerce and La
bor, but that through inadvertence
the testimony on that point had not
V+pn filed in thf record. Should this
claim be substantiated and should no
3*>pal difficulties arise Wong will be
released.
There are seventeen Chinese habeas
corpus cases pending, in some of
â¢which the required appeal had not
been taken, and United States District
Attorney Woodworth will move on
Saturday to dismiss the writs and re
xnand the Chinese. *

OLD SOLDIER LAID AWAY
WITH. MILITARY HONORS
Nearly every, man in San Francisco,
irrespective of race,' color or occupa
tion, heaved a deep sigh of relief yes
terday morning when he pattered to
the door in bare feet, secured his morn-
Ing newspaper and learned that there
would be no street car strike. The
tension of the public had been extreme
over the situation and for weeks it has
been the principal topic of conversa
tion. The result of the settlement was
welcome news in the largest sense.
The public was undoubtedly happy;
the officials of the carmen's union ex
pressed satisfaction at the outcome of
the. threatened trouble; the officials of
the United Railroads say that the
settlement is satisfactory to them; how
the men most Interested feel about the
matter Is contained behind the brass
buttons that line the left side of their
coats. Most of them have nothing to
say, but those who have, talk like a
fighter who goes out from a stiff punch
in the Jaw. They are wondering what
happened to them.
NO MEN ARE HIRED.
The employment office of the United
Railroads went out of business yes
terday morning. The recently longjine
of men anxious for employment on the
street cars dwindled to a draggle of
those who had neglected to read the
papers. These were told that no new
men were needed. The carmen's head
quarters was open until 8 o'clock last
night, but the caretakers passed a
, lonely vigil and when the night had
fairly settled over the city they locked
the doors and went away. The threat
ened strike had evidently passed.
International President Mahon went
to Oakland in the morning and remain
ed there last night. He expressed him
self as being entirely satisfied with the
settlement. Questions involving the
union, he said, would require his at
tention in several cities throughout the
State and when these had been attend
ed to he would return to his headquar
ters at Detroit.
TO IMPROVE T.OCAI1 SERVICE.
The settlement of the differences be
tween the company and its employes
came as a great relief to the manage
ment and directors of the former and
especially to General Manager Chap
man, who will now turn his attention
almost exclusively to the betterment
of the service. Two years ago, when
the United Railroads assumed control
of the local street car lines, It fully
appreciated the Immediate need of Im
provements and Its various department
heads were put to work planning nu
merous changes. Hardly had these
plans been submitted to" and approved
by General Manager Chapman before
the troubles between the company and
its men began, and since then. the time
which General Manager Chapman had
expected to devote to giving San Fran
cisco a better car service has been con
sumed by labor matters with which
he had had no previous experience.
It was announced yesterday that the
United Railroads will, in a very few
weeks, begin a number of improve
ments that will Involve an expenditure
of nearly a million dollars. More cars
are to be placed on the main lines
during the busy portions of mornings
and evenings, time schedules are to
be changed so as' to insure quicker
service from the outlying districts, the
demands of improvement clubs for ex
tensions are to be met, car shops are
to be built and the San Mateo line
is to be extended as far as San Jose.
MOKE CARS ON" MARKET STREET
These various plans, with all their
minute details, accompanied by maps
and estimates of cost are now in Gen
eral Manager Chapman's office ready
to be taken out of the safe, where they
have been lying for many months, and
turned over to the construction depart
ment. It was stated yesterday that one
of the first moves to be made by the
company will be the electrizing of the
steam road between Central avenue
and Its ocean beach terminus. The
next undertaking will be the increasing
of the speed of the electric cars
throughout the city. These cars are
now being operated on an average rate
of about seven and a half miles an
hour and it Is purposed to Increase this
speed to between eight and a half and
ten miles an hour which, of course,
means more cars on the different sys
tems and necessarily more accommo
dations for the traveling public.
On the cable lines, which operate
along Market street, It Is purposed to
reduce the number of cars during the
middle of the day, when the travel is
exceedingly light, and to adopt a new
time schedule whereby, with additional
speed Â«of the cable, which can be ac
complished with the present machin
ery, more cars can be fun during the
busy hours of the evening. Manager
Chapman had been in charge of the
company's properties here only a .few
weeks when he fully appreciated the
fact that the public could -be better
treated in the matter of accommoda
tions between 4 and 6:30 o'clock in the
evenings, and he has long, planned
making the changes mentioned, but, as
already stated, he found his attention
too deeply engaged in labor questions.
WILL. EXTEND LINE TO SAN JOSE I
/ With the increasing demand for a
greater - car service, due mainly to
the growing population of San Fran
cisco, the company has realized the
need of bigger car shops in this . city.
Blue prints of the plans. for a car fac-,
tory, of sufficient capacity for the man
ufacture of all the rolling stock of the
United, Railroads, have been in 'the
hands; of General Manager Chapman
for a number of months, duly approved
by the men who control the roads. The
company is getting the majority of its
better cars from St. Louis at an ex
pense for -freightage that warrants the
building of a factory in this city. Mt
was stated yesterday that the site of
the factory will be that of the present
repair- shops in the Mission,. with. the
addition of an adjoining piece. of; land.
It is estimated that .the working force
of this establishment will, when the.
company gets, it well under way, be
about 500 men...
Plans for' improving the service be
tween San Francisco and San Mateo
over the electric system will be taken
up as rapidly as the opportunity af
fords itself. It is first purposed to in
crease the speed of the cars so as to
lower the present schedule about elev
en minutes between this city and San
Mateo. As to the proposed extension
of the road to San Jose, it was stated
at the company's offices yesterday that
the entire route has been surveyed and
stations and all other details arranged
for carrying out the project as soon as
the material fpr the construction of the
line can be secured. Part of this sur
vey includes a change in the route be
tween San Francisco and San Mateo.
the company having two purposes in
view. One is to bring a larger portion
of the line into the more thickly popu
lated section of this city in order to
increase its earning capacity and the
other is to take the line off the public
highways and operate It through pri
vate domains, which have already
granted rights of way| so as to permit
the running of cars . at a higher
rate of speed than is permitted along
roads over which the counties have
jurisdiction. The company's agents
have been carefully studying the con
ditions between San Francisco and San
Jose and have reported that th*e oper
ation .of an electric service between
these two points, touching at many of
the larger towns along' the way, will
prove successful from \a financial
standpoint.
EVERYBODY SATISFIED.
The United Railroads failed to make
any official statement regarding the
settlement of its difficulties with Its em
ployes. General Manager Chapman
would only say that the settlement was
satisfactory in every, way to the com
pany.
International President Mahon, after
the meeting had adjourned, said:
Â¦V\e are all very happx that the strike has
been averted. The vote was practically unan
imous to accept the terms of the company
and the' assurances of the Mayor that no dis
crimination would be practiced in the future
against members of the union. Personally I
took no hand in the decision further than to
advise the men regarding the conferences I
held with the company and to acquaint them
with every stage of the proceedings. I shall
return to Detroit as eoon as I can settle some
minor matters affecting the unions of carmen
In Oakland and San Jose.
President Cornelius of the local union
said, regarding the settlement:
The vital feature of this entire controversy
has been the demand of the union for "fair
play ' from the company. The men have been
promised It in the past, but have not had it.
This time they Insisted on definite assurance
that they would be treated fairly and their
union not discriminated against. In the final
proposition submitted by the union through
the Mayor of the city the men feel that assur
ances have been Riven that are sufficiently
definite to warrant them Â¦ in -accepting -the
Officials of the Union and the United Railroads Voice
Satisfaction Over the Solution and Company Outlines
Many Contemplated Improvements in Street Car System
proposition. This they did In Rood faith, -with
the belief that the company will in good faith
carry out the terms of the agreement In letter
and spirit.
Mayor Schmitz could be seen only
far a moment. He- said that his posi
tion was simply that of a~ mediator and
that he was overjoyed at the fact that
a strike had been averted.
The articles of agreement were for
mally signed at 3 o'clock yesterday af
ternoon by the officials of the union
and those of the United Railroads.
Mayor Schmitz was present at the
ceremony and assurances of good faith
were strongly expressed by President
Cornelius on behalf of the union and
President Holland on behalf of the
company.
