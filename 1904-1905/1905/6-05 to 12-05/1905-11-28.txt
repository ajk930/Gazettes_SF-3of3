WARDEN J. W. TOMPKINS SAID
TO BE SEATED TO GO.
// js rumored that
Warden Tompkins
is slated for removal
as head of San Quen
tin prison a?id either
Clerk J. M. Oliver
or Sheriff Veale of
Contra Costa County
is to succeed him. In
some measure, the re
port says, friction be
tween Governor Par
dee and Secretary
Metcaif is respon
sible for Tompkins*
probable removal.
Result of Friction
Between Metcaif
and Pardee.
1/atte r_ j^leas cdL
Over the Berkeley
Appointment.
Warden J. W. Tompkinr- of San Qurr.tin
prison is s&id to be elated to ~0, and
eirhÂ«Â»r Clerk J. M. Olivcrof the prison or
Bheriff Veale of Contra Costa County is
billed for the place, says the report.
This move is explained as in ps.rt the
result of friction ' between Governor
J>ard*>e and Secretary of Commerce Vic
tor if. .Metcaif. Warden Tompkins was
appointed by the influence of Metcaif.
The breach between Pardee and Mct
cslf is becoming generally known over
the State. It is said to have been
started over the appointment of a new
postmaster at Berkeley. Pardee want
ed a now man to occupy the position
end M^tcalf insisted that Postmaster
George Schmidt be continued in office.
Eehmidt has hdng on for, four years
row ami -still 'holds the- reins in the
Berkeley office. . f
A: \X IOIS FOR \E\V HEAD.
Governor Pardee is anxious to give
y. W. Richardson, .'.proprietor of the
Berkeley Gazette, tbe place of post
mustor at Berkeley. Of course, Gov
*rnÂ«r Pardee has not bÂ»Â«Â»n peen actively
edvooating the appointment of the
Berkeley editor, but Charlie Spear, the
head of PardÂ«v;> forces in {!j e college
ton-n. !p openly pushing forward the
claim* of Richardson. In the mean
time Schmidt has not been reappointed
end the affair hanes flre.
It is stated authoritatively ; that Gov
ernor Pardee did not want "Schmidt ap
r^iflted postmaster at Berkeley any more
than he wanted to see Tompkins made
warden at San Quentln. J?ut he consented
to please Secretary Metcaif. When the
question of aiww postmaster at Berke
ley arose and he was again disappointed,
the estrangement, with Metcaif began.
Governor Pardee Is said to have been
looking for an opportunity to repay Me t-
CAlf In kind. ...<.;
In the present Board of Prison Direc
tors Tompkins had several stanch friends,
but this fact will not. it Is said, etop them
from appointing another man to fill his
place as head of the prison.
OLIVEII FRIEND OF* PARDEE.
On the other hand. Governor Pardee is
a great friend of James M. Oliver, pres
ent clerk at the prison. Oliver was ap
pointed from Berkeley by the Governor
Rnd is a member of the Spear camp. It
has been rumored for some time that Be
has beÂ»-n after the place now occupied by
Tompkins and the accusations of Tomp
kins that Oliver and Captain Russell
have conspired against him may be true
enough. In case that: Governor Pardee
should decide to have Tompkins removed
Oliver seems to be the likely candidate
for the position. .:...-,_.'.... .<-.:.;
Yet those who are close to the adminis
tration say that Sheriff Veale of Contra
Costa County is the man elated for, the
head of the prison. It is not known who
Is pushing forward his claims, but he Is
known to be a friend of the â¢ Governor.
One thing that may deter Pardee from
making any change is the fact that he
has a political fight in Alameda County
next fall and he may. want to retain Con
gressman Joseph Knowland and .Secre
tary Metcaif on his side. It is saJd that
the Governor has a hard flght before him
and that he will need all the friends that
he' can^ muster to do battle for him.

Press di*patches'from Sebastopol say that
revolutionary; â¢ orators succeeded yester
day in winning: over "a "battalion of reserv
ists and that. In spite of the arrival of
reinforcements to the number of several
thousand, the authorities did not dare to
interfere with a . review , held by thÂ«
mutineers before the Cathedral of St.
Vladimir, which is in the heart of the
town. ; .
. So . far as known, most of tnÂ« demands
of the mutineers have to do with service
conditions, including the release of reserv
ists who have served tb,elr time. Increase -
of, pay, increase; in the allowance of food
and "the removal of alleged Incompetent
and brutal officers.' \u25a0 \u25a0 \u25a0 '
â¢-B.eyond .a determination to proclaim
martial law, -nothing of a definite nature
has transpired regarding the decisions ar
rived at by the Admiralty Council, but
it : Is reported that the council agreed as
to â¢ the Justice -' of many \u25a0 o! the . demands
made' by the mutineers and would recom
mend to the Emperor that \ Immediate
steps be taken to ameliorate the condition
of the sailors. .
The latest dispatches f rom ' Sebastopol
say that the mutineers forced the officers
and crew of the cruiser , Otchakoff to
leave the ship. The crews of the bat
tleships Rostisla v and Tria . Svlatalia, | so
far as at . present known.' have not
mutinied. One reserve battalion, however,
has joined the mutineers.
HCRRYL\G IX LOYAL TROOPS.
\u25a0 Several companies of the Vllna Reji
meat have arrived at Sebastopol from
Theodosia. Martial law has been" declared
1 in' the fortress. Reinforcements also have
arrived at Sebastopol from Slmpheropol,
marching from Inkermao,- between which
! place and Sebastopol the railroad has
j been torn up. - v
j Guns command all the entrances to the
'city* from Admiralty .Point, where the
mutineers are quartered. The battleship
Panteleimon (formerly the Knlaz Potem
klne) and the cruiser otchakoff are in the
bay and in control of the mutineers, who
placed their officers under arrest. . Tha
remaining ships of the Black Sea flset are
off the southern roadstead. Their crevra
have not joined In the mutiny, but it Is
hardly believed they could bo Induced jto
: fire on their comrades ashore.
Reinforcements are on their way to Se
bastopol from Odessa.
It Is . rumored here that Vice Admiral *
Chouknin Is parleying with the muti
neers, offering to' accede to all their de
naands relative to the Improvement of the
service : conditions. This is not officially
confirmed, but a dispatch from the Amer
ican Consul at Sebastopol^ which reports
the,' outlook much less threatening, : says
; it Is reported that Admiral Chouknin has
received orders from St Petersburg to
yield everything/
*. The British Consul is chartering a ves
sel to take off the subjects of Great
Britain. .
:; On; account of the critical nature of the
situation all of the â¢ foreign Embassadora
who were absent on vacations are hastily
returning to St. Petersburg. It is under
stood that the .Russian Government has
given an, lntimation to the foreign pow
ers of the advisability of the presence of
their Embassadors "during the present
crisis. * '~'. .'.' . .
;The Bourse Gazette published a dispatch
from â¢ Sebastopol : saying ' that discord had
already broken - out - among the mutineers
and. confirming. the report that the Brest
regiment. -.under Colonel Dutdehabedeze,
had returned â¢ to duty,' though a company
of .sappers remained with thtÂ» mutineers.

tentiary on November 9. agreed to fur
nish the pistols and explosive which was
â¢used to blow the hole in the stockade.
He was to purchase the pistols in Kansas
City with $40. which they gave him. and
then to pro to Carthage, Mo., and steal
dynamite and nitro-glycerin from the
mines there. These were to be brought
here last Monday night and taken up on
the etockade, which is not guarded at
night. Ryan was then to let himself
dpwn with a rooe on the inside and take
Ihe material and place it under the bench
\u25a0which Vaughn used in the factory. Spen
cer was then to climb back over the wall
and make his escape.
Nothing was heard from him. but oh
Thursday morning the supplies were found
where Spencer said he would DUt them.
Thursday afternoon and night the prison
ers had a consultation and decided to cap
ture Depnty Warden See, Yardmaster
Porter Gilvin and Deputy Yardmaster
Kranlc Moore and make them open the
gate and let them out. or they would
blow their way out.
They proposed to capture an engine,
make the run to Moreau and blow up the
Missouri Pacific bridsre at that place to
prevent pursuit.
On Friday they started to put their
plan in operation, when they found that
only See was In the office. They started
with him and two strangers they found
there to get through the gate. When the
big gate was opened they changed their
plans and started through it. Officer Glay
appeared with a drawn weapon and they
killed him. They then ordered See to let
them out through the gate. He said he
could not. but would let them out through
the office. They called for some one to
opon the gate, and when Captain Allison
appeared with his gun they killed him.
They then blew open the gate and made
their escape.
Warden Hall has sent telegrams all
over the country asking for Spencer's ar
rest. Governor Folk has offered a reward
of $300 and every effort will be made to
capture him.
NEW YORK BALLOTS
\ TO BE RECOUNTED
State Supreme Court Renders
Two Decisions Favor-
KEY YORK, Nov. 27.â Application to
open five ballot boxes and recount the
votes in them, cast during New York's
contested Mayoralty election, was grant
ed to-day by the Supreme Court. The ap
plication was made by William Randolph
Hearst, candidate for Mayor on the Mu
nicipal Ownership League ticket. That
an appeal will be taken was determined
at a conference held to-night in the of
fice of Judge Parker.
Justice Geigerich In the Supreme Court
: o-day handed down an opinion on the
question of counting ballots which have a
mark in the circle of the Republican tick
et and the circle over Mr. Jerome's name
and also in the voting space "before " W.R.
Hearst's name and in the voting space be
fore Jerome's name, the question ' being
whether the 'additional mark In the circle
above Jerome's name affects the ballot.
Justice Geigerich decided that it did not,
the intention of the voter being clearly
shown to vote for Hearst for Mayor, for
Jerome for District Attorney and for the
Republican candidates for all other of
fices, unless it .appeared that the marking
was made for the purpose of identifying
the ballot.

IiAMEHAMEHA'S BONES
MAY HAVE BEEN FOUND
Remains of Hawaiian King
Said to Have Been Dis
covered in a Cave.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
HONOLULU, Nov. 27.â Some discoveries
made in an ancient burial cave on the
Island of Hawaii suggest that the re
mains of Kamehameha* I, the conqueror
of all the Hawaiian group of islands, may
at' last have been found. Besides several
wooden idols of the kind usually made for
ornamenting ancient Hawaiian temples,
there were found in the cave several cala
bashes, or bowls, ornamented with teeth
and containing human bones. It is also
said that a double war canoe was found
Intact, together with a royal feather
cloak and some rare tapas. .
Tradition has -it that the remains of
Kamehameha,- after the death ceremonies
over them were: concluded, were whisked
away by two high chiefs, one of whom
was HoluaJoa.and ri the.other v Hqoplli. . The
remains were supposed to be \ buried in
the face of a -cliff onTthe^Kona coast.
Some think.- they Uwere j. taken farther
away. Kamehameha' I died on May 'B,
IXI9. - ' .'
King Kalakaua at one , time claimed to
have: found the remains of Kamehameha
I, and these "remains" were inclosed in
a casket and now occupy space in the
Royal Mausoleum, in the same room with
the caskets of the Kalakaua dynasty.
That the "remains': have never been ac
cepted as the genuine relics of the con
queror is attested; by the fact that no
move has ever been made to place them
In the vault with the other members of
the Kamahameha dynasty.

SROSEBERY STIES STORM
â¢Rupture Caused by His Re-
I jection of Campbell-Ban
; Herman's Home Rule Idea
Special Dispatch to The Call.
i LONDON. Nov. 27.-LJke the breach be
\u25a0 tween Premier Balfour and Joseph Ctaam
| berlain last week, the split In the Liberal
j party is now receiving the attention of
i the public. The cause of the rupture Is
Lord Rosebery's emphatic '-..: refusal to
serve or to fight under Sir Henry Camp
bell-Bannerman's flag of home rule for
Ireland. .The Unionists, looking on with
mingled joy and amusement... entertain
: the hope that Irreconcilable discord to
I the* Liberal ranks may afford them, after
I all, a fighting chance in the coming elec
| tlons.
An interesting feature which the Lib
eral mutiny, develops is the growing prob
ability that John Redmond's Irish party
will come dangerously near wielding the
balance of power in the next House ot
Commons, which, it is now . perfectly
clear, will contain two Liberal and two
Conservative factions. Between these two
warring groups the Irishmen expect to
sit as the. one united and cohesive party
in Parliament.
Sir Edward Gray, who was Under Sec
retary for Foreign Affairs in the Liberal
Cabinet of 1592-95, speaking'at Newcastle
on-Tyne to-night attempted to dissipate
the widespread impression that the posi
tions taken by Lord Rosebery and Sir
Henry Campbell-Bannerman are Irrecon
cilable. He said he thought Lord Rose
bery had put a wrong construction on
Sir Henry's speech at Stirling, and that
undoubtedly an explanation from the lat
ter would prove there had been a misun
derstanding.
Austen Chamberlain. Chancellor of the
Exchequer, speaking at Reddltch to
night, said that the crisis in the Cabinet
existed solely in the imagination of the
newspapers. There was no such crisis, he
declared, and he added that he was un
able to say when the general elections
would take place. -

NEW YORK. Nov. 27.â One of the mest
interesting features of the life insurance
investigation developed only a few min
utes before, adjournment of the Arm
strong committee to-day, when Theodore
V F. Banta, cashier of theÂ» New York Life
v lntturar.ee Company, testified that at the
beginning of 1901 Edmund T. Randolph,
treasurer of the company, opened Jhe
vaults cf the company, removed New
Ycrk City stock valued at $700,000 and
put a check of the Central National Bank
for $700,000 in Its place. Banta said he
helped to open the vaults at the order of
Randolph, and that he supposed Ran
dolph acted for the finance committee.
The Ftock was kept out for a few days
and waa then returned and the check
withdrawn. The transaction was not re
corded on the bocks cf the company, so
far as Kanta knew. The effect of the
operation would be that any one having
that ptcck would have $7>W.000 worth of
tntaxable property at the end of the
year. Banta did not know who received
the stock. RandoJrh Is expected to be
one of the witnesses to-morrow. :V.-- *
- George W. Perkins, vice president of
the New York Life Insurance Company
and member <?f the firm of J. P. Morgan
& Co., bar.kers. to-day described to the
committee the nansaction which resulted
In his receipt of $10.]93 from Kidder, Pea
body &. Co. of Boston as one-half of the
profiUs of the sale of $2,030,000. worth .of
bonds* of the Mexican Central Railroad
Company. Milton M. Mattison, a book
keeper of the New York Life Insurance
Company, had previously testified that
$950,000 of the life insurance company's
money was used in the transaction and
that Perkins got the profit. Perkins said
to-day that he went into the transaction
for the New York Life Insurance fund,
which is own-sd with the agents of the
New York LJfe Insurance Company, and
that he invested the profits for that fund.
The life Insurance company, he said,
profited to the extent of 5 per cent Inter
est on the loan of $930,0 W. He stated
that the company had no right to the
$40,193 profits.
Perkine also paid that J. P. Morgan &
Co. had taken up notes of Andrew Ham
ilton and E. E. McCall, brother of John
MfCall and formerly Justice of the New
York State Supreme Court, amounting to
|M,SIO, at the request of President John
A. McCall of the New York Life Insur
ance Company, and the amount, with In
terest, was paid to Hamilton by the New

proceeds cf a syndicate in United States

WAWH,TOX "GOOD" FOR $50,000.
President John A. McCall told the com

that Hamilton was "good" for $50,000, and
they had taken Hamilton's notes. Presi

I Burance Ccmpanv owed Hamilton the $36,-

'him- The result was that the payment
I did not appear, on the books of the com
pany. The reason was that he" wanted to
keep do'frn Hamilton's expenses.
I Much evidence was given by both Per
i kins and President McCall about the New ;

ticipation in the United States Steel Cor

[230,000, having the deposits of the New;
â¢ York Life lnsurar.ee Company for about ;
I that amount. t The New York Life Insur- -
I ance Company got 75 per cent of the j
y profits,: and Perkins contended that it j
' was a safe and profitable venture. Presl-i
(dent McCall,. safd the" life insurance com- I
I pany participated directly instead of
j indirectly.
Perkins testified to-day that the Hamil
j ton account was treated as - confidential.
J. P. Morgan & Co. never had any other j
\ account with Andrew Hamilton than the !
i one r.nder Inquiry.-. Hughes < asked , why
the New York ' Llf e'fdld not. pay the bills
of Hamilton and E. E. McCall, if It was
New York Life j business. Perkins- said
McCall said he felt it was a gfood way to
do it, to pay it out of the proflts.
"In that way it would not get on the
New York Life's books," said Hughes.
"Yes." â
Perkins said voluntarily that the plan
of syndicate participation disclosed:.. was
made by him.' He added that the New
York Life's proflts by it were more, than
$425,000, or eighteen -times; his salary, as
vice president. He declared' it was not a
"devious" way, as described by Hughes,
and said he was perfectly willing to stand
on his record. â¢ >
Perkins said President McCall had sent
a letter to Hamilton's address in Europe,
and to his Albany office to be forwarded
and asked him to come and testify. Per-,
kins did not know whether McCall asked
Hamilton to send an accounting if he'
could not return to New York. -
PROFITS USED TO PAY NOTES. ";
Hughes then read the notes given by
Edward E. McCall and Andrew Hamilton,
to the Bank and Trust Company. Per
kins did not know whether the amount,
was for legal expenses. He said ,the;
debts toJ. P. Morgan & Co. were liqui
dated from the profit. the New York Life
received in a steel syndicate participa
tion. . " r '
Hughes read from a blotter of the New
York Life Insurance Company, showing
the payment of $59,310 to Andrew Hamil-'
ton. AsKed if the payment appeared In
the report to the State Insurance Depart
ment, Perkins said he did not know, but
understood President McCall settled the
matter. Asked why McCall and Andrew
Hamilton got money on their notes from
the Central National Bank and the New
York Security and Trust Company, Per
kins said he did not know, but could find,
out. '\u25a0"
Hughes then asked Perkins to explain'
why be (Perkjns) received a profit of
$40,123, which was paid by Kidder, Pea
body & Co. of/Bpstpn.to. the. -New .York
Life for a loan- of $230.000. 1n:f1Â»4.'0 Perking
said- that Robert Winsor of itidder. Pea
body & Co. of Boston called at the office
of J. P. Morgan & Co. In June, 1904, and
asked them to take up a joint account
with his firm in connection with the Mex
ican Central Railway Company. Perkins
told him that J. P. Morgan & Co. cpuld
not do It, but he (Perkins) would take
care of it. Perkins said, further, that he
took up the business for the Nylic fund,
which is owned by the agents of the New
York Life Insurance Company, of which
Perkins Is trustee. Part of the proposition
was that the Mexican Central Railroad
Company Bhould be^supplled with $2,000,000
at once. The Nylic fund did not have so
much cash and Perking did not wish to
disturb Us Investments, so he. arranged
with Edmund D. Randolph, treasurer of
the New York Life Insurance, Company,
to take $1,000,000 worth ; of Mexican Cen
tral, bonds at .5 per cent, interest. The
New York-Life. lnsurance Company, said
Perkins, paid . Kidder, Peabody & Co.
$250,000 and held the bonds until August
11, 1904. when the' Boston firm repaid the
loan, interest on $1,000,000 and $40,193 profit
on the transaction to the life insurance
company. The profit of $40,193 was paid
to Perkins as trustee of the Nylic fund.
Perkins said'he paid the money Hnto the
Nylic fund. The proflts were serft to the
New York Life Insurance Company, he
said, because the company was the only
party known to Kidder, Peabody & Co.
In the transaction, and , the check was
cashed and' the cash'; paid to . Perkins be
cause If it had been (cashed and entered
upon the books of the New York Life.ln
surance Company, It might have been said
that the ,New .York Life received;: the
profit and '..then :ffave. It away. A ;
JUGGLERY WITH THE BOOKS. v
Perkins said the profits of the. Mex
ican Central- deal were derived- by the
sale of ,$2,000,000 of bonds by Kidder,
Peabody A^Co.'^ He said nothing to
Winsor about;Nylic or sending the
bonds to the New York Life Insurance
Company.' ; He said he probably- made,
the latter, request direct to Kidder,: Pea-"

said, was .never checked t overt to the

Hughes asked how, it was '--Invested.

Before he went to Europe recently,'
Perkins made a memorandum-show^ing
what the Nylic fund owed, so that it

and the memorandum was still in ex

I Hughes read an* article of the by-laws
exempting the trustees from the neces

losses of the Nylic fund, and Perkins said

wouloNmake/them good, though not legal

HAMILTON GOT $80,000 A- YEAJu'v
President. John , A*v BlcCall op the .New
I York Life-Insurance- Company was; next
called and ; was asked Jabout-. the notes
given .by Andrew, Hamilton and why the
New York Life paid them. Up said Ham
ilton g0t. 579,000 pr JSO.OOO from the New
York. Life in 190 L In six ' years he got
about $80,000 a year. In a" talk with Ham
ilton as- to the cost of the \u25a0 legal -bureau
of the New York " Life,', McCall estimated
the average yearly cost at H05,<)00." McCall
said he wanted to "keep . the
down to $2000 for each State and Canada.
At the end of the year Hamilton said
about $55,000 was due him on whafThe
had paid out for the company.: The New
York Life paid the claim.
President McCall did; not recognize , any
of the . notes shown to-day., .lie ~ : said: no
statement was required of ) Hamilton .of
what advances he had made. "In 1896 Mc-
Call made an arrangement that Hamilton
should have 5 per cent of. his disburse

How many women realise that men-

entirely free from periodical suffering-
it is not the plan of nature that women
\u25a0hottld suffer so severely.
Thousands of American women, how- 1
eTer, have found relief from all monthly
suffering- by taking Lydja E. Pinyham's
Vegetable Compound, asr it is the most
thorough female regulator . known tc
medical science. It euros the condition
which causes so much discomfort and
robs menstruation of its terrors.'

COURT UPHOLDS
GARBAGE LAW
Exclusive Fraiichise Granted
'by. City of San Francisco
Is -Declared Constitutional
DECISION BY HAELAN
Supreme Tribunalof United
States Passes ,on a Case
A ppealed From the Btate
. WASHINGTON. Nov. 27.â The Supreme
Court" of 4 the United States to-day- sus-]
tained'. the '"ordinances of the cities of De
troit and j San -Francisco, granting exclu
sive â¢/franchises to remove the garbage of
the two respectively. ~~ The decision
was ,;by.'; Justice Harlan and "the ordi
nances \were> held to be in harmony with
the Vights of State municipalities to exeir
cise^police control of the protection of the
public health. ;""-:'T;. 1 '
Â» The, title of : the. California case was the
California* Reduction Company et . al. ' va.
the i Sanitary '. Reduction Works of San
Francisco. The- California case involved
the/ -validity " of an exclusive franchise
granted -by, the city of San Francisco to
the^Sanitary â¢ Works to remove and dis
pose, of * garbage in that city. The' suit'
was'brought originally to enjoin the Cali
fornia \;company : and -140 Italian citizens
from 'performing ' this service, and. the
local /courts sustained, the contract, as
"also/Mid^ the /Federals Court of Appeals/
The.Callforhia: company brought the case
to the t Supreme Court on'the plea that the
clty,' l goyernment had no authority to
grant van f exclusive franchise :' for this
work to any. one. "Referring to the,con
stitutional: point i*aised Justice Harlan
said, in disposing of the California- case:
The. creation and destruction of garbage and
house rciuse under authority' and Â«t' a p!ace
deslenated" by law. as a- means of the protec
tion of thei . public health cannot . bÂ« properly
regarded 'as ;a taking* of private property for,
public - use without . compensation simply be
cause \u25a0 such; carbase may have \u25a0- had at \u25a0 tlia'
tlme-of.its destruction an element of value
for certain purposes. This court lias said that
the possession and enjoyment of all rights are
subject to 'such conditions as may badeÂ«mÂ»d
reasonable by the governing authorities of the
country and subject to the safety, health, peace
and g-ood morals of the community. The exer
cise, of- thÂ«Â° police pover by the destruction' of
property which is itself &/ public' nuisance Is
very different from taking: property without
due prccess of law. In the one case a nuisance
is abated; : in 'the other unoffending ' property
is taken away from an ! Innocent owner.
DECLARES TWO ACTS 'OF LAST
LEGISLATURE ARE ILLEGAL
Supreme Court Sustains K. Sohnke's
Contention and ' Order* Hl* Release '
â¢ ... .^ Front Custody of Sheriff.
; The Supreme Court yesterday decid
ed that -two /acts of the' last Legisla
ture relating to charging: interest and
payment of fees on $100 loaned on the
security of - a chattel mortgage
were unconstitutional. K. Sohnke,
who "was' recently 'sentenced "to
pay a fine of $100 or goto jail, chose
to .make a' test case and accepted im
prisonment. He appealed to the' Su
preme Court /for a writ of habeas cor
pus on the ground that the legislative
acts -involved , \u25a0 were unconstitutional.
Judge ' Charles W. Slack was retained
as' his attorney. The Supreme' Court
upheld; the contention, granted the pe-.
tltlon and ordered Sohnke's release.
\u25a0In the opinion' the court says:* j?
There is. no substantial, reason why, those

CHINESE -ENGAGED
IN SHIPPING OLIVES
Federal Coiirt Case Eeveals
That California Growers
Have Eivals.
California olive growers will be very
much alarmed when they learn that the
Chinese in Asia have gone into the busi
ness of exporting \u25a0 pickled olives to the
United States to compete with the Cali
fornia product. Yet such is the fact aa
revealed by 'a case now in the hands of
the United States District Attorney for
the 1 Northern District of California.
The matter has-been sedulously kept se
cret by fthe : Federal â¢ officials, - because of
an Insensate order .by the Secretary of
the/Treasury.
; Some time^ago certain Chinese firms in
Hongkong shipped 'to San Francisco by
the America 1 * "Maru and other ; vessels a
large quantity of olives .In i earthenware
jars, % each ' .of ten gallons* capacity.
The duty of 25 cents per gallonâ that des
ignated by law for olives In jarsâ was Re
ported by United States Appraiser John
T. Dare and was exacted by Customs* Col
lector Stratton. Thi3 tax was paid .under
â¢protest by the Chlneae firms in this city
[ to which the olives Â«had" been consigned,
and they appealed from the- decision of
the Collector to the Board of General Ap
praisers. The . board decided I that, when
an earthenware jar wa3 large enoughi'to
hold ten gallons it became a cask. or bar
rel, and that the Collector, should have
levied a duty of only 15 cents per gallon,
which was the duty , on \u25a0 olives m casks.
From this decision the Government has
appealed to the United States ,' Circuit

ALAMEDA FOLK
GIVE MUSICALE
FOR CHARITY
BY ZOE GREEN RADCLIFFE.
OAKLAND. Nov. 27. â The rain is very much
Hke that .very disagreeable person, the very
candid friendâ they both do much good, but
in Fuch a nasty manner that we wish they.
Wouldn't. Of course everybody is telling every
body else how glad they are to Bea the rain
and then heaving a sigh as they think of the
week's smart functions and dalntj' frills that
may have .to risk, ruin if the downpour con
tinues â which, or course, we are all praying
for it to do. j
The rain <lid not prevent the "pound party"
at Mrs. K. J. Dcdge't; home in Alameda from
b> i."g a success. Â«ociaily, musically and finan
cially. Tlie entertainment â which had been
arranged to gain tunds wherewith to provide
Christmas dinners lor the poor and needy â
was under the ausj.Rrs of the Alameda Wo
men's Charitable Association. Mrs. Dodge had
given the uÂ»e of her home, and under the dl
r*-ctlon of Miss Blanch* Tisdale an exception
ally good musical programme was given, both
atternoon and evening. Miss Ttsdale and Mrs.
Mace Thompson, vocalists; Miss Martha Snow,
violinist, and Miss Win i: rod Mastick, pianist,
were participants In the day programme, while
equally delightful numbers were rendered in
th<Â» evening by Miss Marion Coyle and Horatio
Cogswell, singers; iln>. Hughes, pianist, and
Mies Sutphen. violinist.
I A card party that promises to be "the mer
i riest as well as the smartest event 'of tbe
week Is that planned by Mrs. Traylor, .Bell
and Mrs. Georgn Cl.asf . .themselves scarcely
-more^ than fcrloef, for a 'quartet of recently
engaged- girls. Misses Chlckerlng, Treanor,
Downey' and Goodfellow. The" Webster street
home of the Chases Is to be the scene of the
affair and as It is one of the most charming
residences in town it Is always an attractive
place to society's maids and matrons. Mrs.
Bell, who was Helen Chase. Is very popular
and her ov.-n wedding Is still .fresh In the
minds of the guests as one of the prettiest
affairs of the year.
Preparations for the doll show are progress
ing. Mr*. J. J. Allen, who managed the living
pictures so successfully last year, has charge
of them again, and they are sure to be pr
tlstlc. '
The West Oakland Home, which is always
the beneficiary of the doll .show. Is a most
worthy charity, as many homeless little ones
are well cared for there. The children are
looking forward eagerly to Thanksgiving day.
Annually, Harry W. Bishop of Ye Liberty pro
vides a "really, truly" banquet for these llttl*
orphans and presides as host, and this year
Frank Graham, the popular young manager
of the theater, has Invited the children to
tnjoy the Saturday matinee. So two kinds
hearts are making thl* week a very bright one
for many little unfortunates.
. Mise Edith Church, daughter of Mw. A. R.
Church, and a niece of the j Geor-e W. Mc-
Nears Sr.. was married Saturday evening to
Richard Burke of San Francisco.
The wedding took place at the McNear resi

and -sustained injuries which are ex

badly fracturing his, skull and also
; breaking three ribs. \lt was thought
\u25a0 at first that Saxe had /come in contact

[ carrying 2300 volts, hut ' an examina
tion: of his' body failed to disclose any

SOIL EXPERT
WRITES FOR
ENCYCLOPEDIA
BERKELEY. Nov. 27. â Professor E. W. HII-
Kard completed to-day an Important article
on chemical soil analysis, which he was asked
to write by Professor Liberty Hyde Bailey of
Cornell for -a great- agricultural .encyclopedia
the latter is preparing to print. Eminent ex
perts in various fields , of . agricultural science
are to be represented in the- encyclopedia, and
Professor II Heard, famous for his researches
and experiments where soil secrets are con
cerned, was honored by a request to contribute
an authoritative article on chemical soil analy
sis. -. â¢ \u25a0 . .;, â¢\u25a0"â¢ - - ; "\u25a0- â¢
In his article Professor Hllgard writes that
"chemical analysis of soils alms' to 'determine
the kind and amount of plant food ingredients
contained In" the soils. . "Simple as it seems,"
says the expert; "this problem is, greatly com
plicated by the fact that these ingredients exist
In soils in at least three categories of condi
tions. Soil is formed from rocks by process
'called weathering. One character of soil is the
portion as yet unaffected. ; or fresh; another, is
that soil which U partially or fully weathered;
and the third that which Is rendered soluble
by water." \u25a0 ..' -â¢ . . _-
It Is .stated to be impossible for chemists, to
fully Imitate the action of plant roots on soils,
as plants differ In ability to: utilize the. "re
serve" or weathered ' portion of the ' soil. So
do the solvents at the command of chemists
differ In solvent power. \u25a0- Even ' if we knew,
say:; Professor . HUgard, exactly the solvents
used by the plants, we 'could not put them into
action in precisely, the same manner. Soil
analysts can point out the great abundance or
great scarcity 'or absence of each plant* food
ingredient, . however, and these Indications can
be verified by cultural experience, thus vastly
abridging the blind and.: costly experiments
that would \u25a0 otherwise ke required.-,
\u25a0 Experienced experimenters \u25a0In Europe, ac
cording to Professor Hllgard/ say that.lt takes
about seven years to come to perfectly definite
conclusions regarding the nÂ«eds of cultivated
land by means of plat cultures.' Well cultured
pot cultures are much more - conclusive, , but
cannot well be made by the farmer, f â¢
Concluding his lengthy and. exhaustive arti
cle.. Prof essor Hilgard , says : '.'Chemical soil
analysis. Judicially interpreted," : is the quickest
mode ol obtaining definite Information, regard-
Ing the permanent value of soils and can prob
ably serve for the Immediate producing capac
ity also." â¢

death was caused by. ptomaine poisoning.
It was at first believed' tliat the poison
was" contained In 'some ; ' cold-fish which
was eaten by the child on the afternoon
that he was taken "sick, but . to-day the
boy's father declared' that he was sure
his child - had been poisoned by some
candy sold by| a peddler who had been
vending his wares In -the' neighborhood
on the day thechlld became, ill. v
On account of the almbst complete as

If the peddler can; be-located he will -be
held pending an investigation of the case.

KELLEY'S DEATH
IS MYSTERIOUS
Suburban Police Unable to
Determine. Whether Unfor

YOUTHS GIVE A CLEW
Tell of Seeing Crouching
, Form of a Man Near Spot
Passed by the Deceased
Special Dispatch to The Call.
PALO ALTO, Nov. 27.-SI.X deputy
sheriffs and constables of San Mateo and
Santa Clara counties ire working here
endeavoring to explain the cause of the
death of John W. Kelle.v, who was found
lifeless lr/a buggy by Ernie Sllva, gate
keeper at the railroad crossing, la^t
night. Murder Is suspected strongly by
Constable Grider of Palo Alto, and since
the Coroner's Jury decided death was due
to a compound fracture of tbe skull it Is
commonly believed that Kelley was killed
by hoboes, who followe-3 him from Menlo
Park. â¢ ' \u25a0- -' ".-.',â¢ ;
Although the dead man is known to
have gone to Menlo Park for, liquor. th<Â»Â«p
who saw him start for home say he was
not intoxicated. The opinion of Dr. G. E.
Hall, who examined the body of Kelley
at the Inct'uest, is that he fell forward in
a drunken stupor, striking his head on
the bend in the shaft of the buggy, caus
ing his death. Developments, however.
Indicate that the dead man was not drunk
enough to lose consciousness, and as all
the whisky he bought was found in the
buggy more credit is given to the murder
theory. \u25a0
Kelley hired a rubber-tired buggy and
single horse from Peter Mullen's stable
here last night at- 7 o'clock to drive, as
he said, to Menlo Park. James Steven
son, an employe of the stable, rented tbe
rig. He says he did not consider Kelley
intoxicated. .-\u25a0
Barney' Burk. a Menlo Park saloon
keeper, and the proprietors of the other
places Kelley visited claim that no one
â¢was seen with Kelley during the hour h-j
was in the town. | Frank Wulff, a youth
living here, asserted to-day after the ver
dict, of the Coroner's jury .was rendered
that he was driving with "Jack" Wilson
toward Menlo Park about 8 o'clock last
night, and when crossing the Ban Fran
cisqulto Creek bridge they saw a crouch
ing figure silhouetted against tbe sky.
Wulff asserts the man remained motion
less until they passed,
i Kelley -was found hanging lifeles over
the edge of the buggy. At first the body
was not seen by Silva when he stopped
the returning ' horse. Harry Johnson, a
driver for Mullen's stable, recognizing
the rig, was the first to see the body.
Deputy Sheriffs Phil Atkinson, Harry
Butts and Frank Minaker, Constable
Grider and Policeman Hill followed all

Health having completed an investigation con
cerning Â» the' eanitary conditions surrounding
the fish supply of San Francisco the following
Instructions are herewith Issued governing such
regulations : - . "'
No fish caught In the waters of tbe bay or
other streams â¢ and arriving at \u25a0 Fishermen's
wharf shall be washed, dipped or soused - In
the waters of the bay adjacent to said wharf.

\u25a0 No crabs shall be sold or â¢ offered for sale
after twenty-four hours have elapsed from the

ceives the drainage both, from -the ground sur
face and from the sewers of a large territory
and contamination of .these products Is likely
to ensue. The catching of shrimps, clams and
small' fish In this portion of the bay is hereby
prohibited on penalty of arrest, and all local
dealers are hereby warned to obtain a knowl

WILD AUTOISTS
Authorities of San Mateo
County Determined to Put
Stop to Reckless Driving:
PROMISES FOKGOTTEX
Willful Disregard of Speed
Law by Motorists Arouses
the Suburbanites to Action
Special Dispatch to Tfes Call.
REDWOOD CITT. Nov. Z7.â The reck
less use of automobiles on the roads of
San Mat eo County Is to bÂ« stopped. The
patience of the officiate of the county has
been strained to the breaking point, and
what the unheeding drivers would not d?
by request they will be forced- to do by
demand or suffer the consequencesâ fines
and imprisonment. Agitation against the
gross violation of .speed regulations has
reached a ooint where the authorities of
: the county must take cognizance . of it.
The people who are in dally Jeopardy from
the dangerously operated machines are
threatening to take the matter into their
own hands and wreak vengeance on the
-offending owners of automobiles,
j With this danger to the peace and good
repute of the county so Imminent some
official has I become imperative.
Accident after accident has happened on
the roads because of the contempt of
the drivers of automobiles for the lives
of people who may be on the roads in
vehicles. Men and women have been
killed ' in runaways caused by racing
autos. and as a protest has had no effect
something more .emphatic has been deter
mined upon by officers and citizens alilte.
In discussing the matter editorially
shortly after the recent football game at
Stanford University the San Mateo Lead
er voiced public opinion very completely.
In this article the Leader calls uoon the
officials of the county to adopt restrictive
measures Immediately and to protect citi
zens from this grave danger to their
lives. After the football game, the Lead
er says, a large number of automobiles
raced along the county road from the
university to San Francisco, and in In
numerable instances threw to the winds
every regard f or_ the law regulating
speed. Continuing the Leader says: -
Atter the game a hundred or more of tha
machines poured out Into the county road
from, the university grounds and It seemed
to be the aim of every chauffeur to cover the
distance between. . Palo Alto and San Fran
cisco in as short a time as possible. The re
sult was a string- of autos more than half a
mile lons running at their very utmost speed. /
The passing of the numerous^ excursion train*
provided an opportunity to> race which could
not be restated by the auto drivers, and. amid
a cloud of dust the machines literally burned
mile after mile of the distance. Drivers] of
teams were compelled to pull out into the side
roads or to seek refuge by driving into private
places until the reckless cavalcade had passed.
As the majority of .the machines belonged
to the members of the California Automoblla
Club, who are on record as ha v ms Dromisett
to obey the speed laws of this county, the
officers thought it unnecessary to Impose any
restrictive measures, relying on the sood faith
of the parties In making their promises, but
In the future no chances will be taken and
they will be trusted no lonrer.
In the mad rush three, machines wer*
wrecked. â¢* One turned over near Redwood City.
another save up - the ghost near \u25a0 the I tome -
stead, while a tMrd went out of business) near
Mlllbrae. Nione of the occupants were Injured.
A number of family horses which were being
driven on the road and -which at various
places were In the thick of the devilish pro
cession have not yet ceased to snort, and It
win be some time before they resaln their
usual equanimity.- '
In the meantime the officers of thlÂ» county
will treat the members of the California Au
tomobile Club' In precisely the same manner
as any other law-breaking autoist. Their pre
vious promises to be good will go. for naught.
STUDENTS LOOK
FOR LOST BOY
Special Dlssatsn to ThÂ» Can.
PALO ALTO. Nov. 2T.â Twenty-fIYO
students of the Stanford University to
night are scouring the hilla back of the
university in search of Erie Johnson, 'a
nine-year-old boy who* left his home
this morning at .9 o'clock to go to
school. While the students are bravely
facing the Cold, cutting wind and the
heavy rain that is rapidly turning the
creeks in the neighborhood Into raging
torrents, there gleams from the Memo
rial Chapel of. the university the rays
of an Immense electric light, to guide
them as far as possibfe In their search
and to serve as a beacon when they
start to return. The light was turned
on as soon as the disappearance of the
boy became known at the university.
It i 3 feared that the search. for the
boy will be . fruitless, as ' the' day haa
been a stormy one and so cold that a
lad of his tender years would soon suc
cumb If exposed any â length . of ' time.
The general belief is that the boy, in
stead of going to school, went to. the
hills to. gather the red berries so plen
tiful - there about . Thanksgiving time.
and. that he has either : been frozen to
death or drowned, ln one of the creeks.
He was last seen on the "bus that leaves
this town for the university.

PROVES STRONG PLAY
Mansfield Saves
Moliere's Fine
Humor
Actor's Alceste
Is Pleasing
Portrait
Over Beas. and a trifle of 250 years back,
Richard Mansfield -vrent for his last new
play of this eeason, the Mollere "The Mis
anthrope." Last night Mr. Mansfield and
bia company presented the comedy at the
Grand Opera-house for the first time here,
as the actor has produced it this season
for the first time. Englished, in America.
Ua has produced a!*o this season the
first English "Don Carlos." Gratitude
for the Schiller importation was mixed,
not to say somewhat scant; for the Mo
llere we incur a debt without a doubt.
The French classic was simply rolled 'un
der the tongue, the evening almost an
unmixed delight. Almost. Mr. Mansfield
â¢till has his company with himâ but you
can't spoil Mollere. As with whiskyâ as # I
am most potently assured â there is none
bad, so le there no bad Moliere^ â only good
and better. In two instances In the cast
It was at its superlative, and the rest
played fair.
It were late to accuse Moliere of being
not dramatic hereâ and, besides, Schlegel
began it. Then, as Goethe disagrees, that
\u25a0were also safe. His masterpiece the com
edy Is, all agree, Voltaire of the com
pany, and Tame says of Maliere here,
'"In h!m we taste a national pleasure,"
Â«nd to an American audience 260 years
after itÂ« writing this Jeweled comedy,
depenfling wholly for charm upon its
vivid portraiture of a few French court
folk of Louis XlVs day. last night proved
tfresh Its commanding genius. A few
scenes, hardly more dramatic than the
"Dolly Dialogues" or old Plato's, or Os
car Wilde's later effort in "The Critic as
Artist." by their sheer, brilliant, del!
ciously posed truth hold to their last pre
cious word.
Probably one would find Alceste's prob
lem among Solomon's trouble*; it is cer
tainly of to-day, as It will be of to-mor
rowâtruth or expediency. Oacar Wilde.
arain suggestive here, would offer his
"When to LJe and How," as does M.
Philinte before him. How admirably
contrasted the two friends! How cleverly
the dramatist divides the sympathies of
the spectator between them! "Speak the
truth always," cries Alceste as the cur
tain rises. He is still shouting his battle
cry as the curtain falls, lady-love lost,
friends aiienatcd, himself bound for the
dfsert.
Philinte says: "Not so; it is not worth
wrbDe wasting the truth upon every one."
Oronte's entrance, the bad poet with a
"little thSng of his own" up his berlb
boneÂ«J sleeve, affords a delicious oppor
tunity for the revelation of the different
ways of Philinte and Alceste. Oronte
asks Alceste's frank opinion of the verse.
Exquisite here is the enjoyment of the
audience, in Alceste's confidence. Oronte
reads, Philinte Is "charmed." Alceste.
under his breath, however, has to say
only "rubbish!". PniJtate .flnds them
again most "skillfully turnerl." Alceste's
"frank opinion" then bursts out. You
cannot but admire both, the tact of Phil
inte, who answers the fool according to
his folly, and the .blazing honesty of Al
ceste, who, however, uses his bombs to
kill bedbugs.
This scene, as it was the best acted of
â¢ the comedy, perhaps appealed most last
night, though the final scene of the ex
posure of Celimene's treachery was a
near second. Mr. Mansfield was the Al
ceste, as it is about time to say, and adds
in the portrait another peculiarly admir
able figure to his gallery. Not a surly
Timon ho makes of the Alceste, but a
choleric, generous, clean-hearted, loving
â¢oul to whom both liking and respect go.
Not "severely odious- and ridiculous," as
one writer accuses Mollere of making
Alceste, la Mansfield's. Throughout he
grips your sympathy, wrings your heart
by Alceste's 111-timed testlness, compels
your admiration for the man's sterling
honesty. The closing scene â which in
this comedy de luxe comes early enough
is a little miracle and astonishment of
tenderness. No need to advise to wait
for It. The hatpin might have been ex
tinct last night for all one knew of It
here.
Mr. Kenyon Leslie was the other acting
euccess of the evening. His Oronte is a
gem of foppery, from his falsetto to his
ber:bboned toes. He is the very prettiest
thing, all curls and lace, and satin, and
pink bows, and a mince and voice to
match to distraction. Positively fatal
\u25a0uch an Oronte must have been to a

much. Her coquetry was made in Ger
many, surely, rather than In Prance. The i
scenes betwen Celimene and Alceste suf- |
fered, but the particular loss was In the
scene between the prude Arslnoe and the
coquette. Here Miss Barry should Burely
have been the victorious one, but it was
rather Axslnoe's railing that hit home.
Mr. Andrews, again, rather than the
sweet and reasonable (and tlme-serv-
Jng) Philinte, suggests a valet rather
than friend, Alceste's. valet being done,
by the way, In capital v fashion by
Henry Wenmain. The two fops, Acaste
and Clltandre. were well filled in by
Mr. Handyslde and Mr. Warde. and If

ture of money the managers had
transformed the Alhambra -into one of
' tho prettiest places of amusement in
I the city. Decorated ,ln red, and gold
with green velvet portieres around the
entire rear of the house, the theater
presented as pretty an appearance as
could be desired. With a larger stage
than the one on which the company
had played for the past few yeara,
a superb performance of the melo
drama "The Millionaire Detective" was
given. Herschel Mayall, in the lead

"My Friend from . India" took the
fancy of the Alcazar audience decidedly
last evening. Laughter was practically
continuous and that being the aim of
the play, it may be said fairly to have
realized all expectations and to have
justified the advertisements. "My
Frienu from India" is simply a con
glomeration of happenings more or
less funny, with' complications galore,
all originating in and growing out of
the scrapes Into which "one of the
boys" falls. Juliet Crosby as the Ger
man maid with a dialect, Maher as a
fakir from India, Fred Butler as a re
tired pork packer, Charles Waldron as
the scapegrace' son arid Henry D.

of the work and carried off the funny

WASHINGTON, Nov. 27.â The Supreme

firmed r the decision of : the United States
District Court of Vermont In the case of
Mrs.' Mabel Rogers, . who ' Is under sen
tence of death In Vermont for the murder
of her husband. The effect of the decision
will: be to .again .-'place,. the' responsibility

the State authorities, and if in the mean
time neither the .Governor nor the State
courts take action in Mrs. Rogers' behalf
her : execution must occur, on . the day -set,
which is December 8 next. - Z:
The court held that it was without? J
urisdiction in. all the* points raised.
In his opinion Justice Day laid no stress
upon the sex of Mrs. Rogers, but dealt
with the case : upon purely legal grounds.
Reciting the proceedings in the case, he
took up the. various contentions made in
the woman's, behalf, holding each in turn
to ; be . ineffective. .: On. the 'point : that Mrs.
Rogers has been held in solitary confine
ment for; more than three months he said
the record does not, show that: she is* so
held, though admittedly held In close.con
finement. This course was, he said, with
in the rights â¢ of the . State and could not
be used as grounds for interference by the
Federal courts. â¢:. â¢. . ; \u25a0 . : â¢ '
The charge against Mrs. Rogers Is .that
of , murdering her. husband by administer

1903. She was tried in December, 1903, and
her. trial resulted in a sentence of death
bj* hanging. . ; â v /^ ; \u25a0
The case has, attracted much attention
on'account of the defendant's sex and be
cause of- the' many narrow escapes she
has had from paying the extreme penalty

fixed for February 3, 1905, but the Gover
nor of . the State granted a reprieve on
February^ 1 until June 2. c When it seemed
that .she -must Inevitably.' be hanged on

of this city that are objecting to the
granting of an extension of franchise
to the San Jose, Santa Clara and Alum
Rock electric railways petitioned the
City: Council' to-day to be. granted a

of the company run- for nineteen years
and the company has asked an exten
sion to fifty years from date. .- In con
sideration :of this they offer to pay
$1500 and 2 per cent of the earnings of
the road after ten years. The labor
organizations declare it would be
against the interests of the community
to grant the franchises without some
concessions in return. They believe a
provision should be inserted limiting
the fare to Alum Rock Park to 5 cents.
The. rate now is 25 cents for the round
trip. This evening the City Council
set next Monday as the time for hear

TUESDAY.../.* NOVEMBER 28, 1905
THE TEHUANTEPEC RAILROAD.
MEXICO is by no means to be left out of the commercial cal
culation of the world. Her domestic and exotic enterprises
are numerous, important and profitable. They include all of
her industries and productive resources and transportation, and are
pushed by engineering of a high class.
The late Senator Gwin, who left his mark deeply cut upon early
California, was a man of great insight and genius. He looked far
into the future and had accurate judgment upon things simple and
great that had in them the potency of change in the direction and
destiny of nations. He has been misjudged in that part of his career
between the Civil War and his death. He was exiled to Paris by
the war, and when the expedition to put Maximilian on the Mexican
throne was organized he had so impressed himself upon the. Marquis
de Montholon that he accompanied it, holding some commission that
gave him authority. When the Austrian organized the ephemeral
empire of Mexico, Gwin was given control of the state of Sonora.
He took it, intending to found there an American state, that might
be expected to follow the course that was taken by Texas, after the
battle of San Jacinto in 1836. But the prolongation of our civil war
and the growing infirmity of the new empire thwarted his plans and
They failed and felJ. Other great plans have met a like fate, but it
by no means ensmalled the greatness of their conception. .
After the Civil War was over and Maximilian was shot at Ouer
etaro, Senator Gwin continued his lively interest in the importance
*of Mexico. He secured some kind of option on a railroad to be
built across the isthmus of Tehuantepec to connect the gulf of Te
hiiantepec with the gulf of Campeachy, and furnish a rail connection
between the Atlantic and Pacific that would shorten the distance be
tween San Francisco and New York by 1200 miles, giving the Mexi
can route that much advantage over the Panama route. But he ;
went further than a mere rail connection, and proposed to make it a ;
ship railway. Ships were to be basined on one terminus, received
into adequate cradles, pulled upon the tracks and hauled by locomo
tives to the other terminus and returned to the water in twenty-four
hours. Though the road would cross the Sierra Madre Mountains,
no- considerable engineering obstacles were in the way.
Through the Mexican Minister in Washington, Senor Romero,
Gwin enlisted the interest of Mexico and the project was presented
to capitalists. Although it would have been at that time the satis
fying solution of afflicting problems in transcontinental transporta
tion, he did not succeed in getting the capital to put it under way.
Then followed the French fiasco on the Panama canal, in an at
tempt to solve the same problem. Our Government had its atten
tion drawn to an isthmian canal and followed the Nicaraguan project
to a finish, but before that project grew cold it was determined that
a canal should be built by our Government, and not by private en
terprise. At that point Mexico began to take notice. Diaz, secured
for the Government the route of Gwin's old option across the isth
mus of Tehuantepec, and now there is a railroad there between the
two oceans ready for the transportation of freight and passengers.
True, it is not Gwin's ship railway, but it may at any time be made
over into such a highway. It passes between the states of Tobasco
and Chiapas on the south and Vera Cruz and Oaxaca on the north.
The managers engage to unload freight on one side, carry.it to the
other and reload it aboard ship in two days. The distance being
1200 miles shorter between New York and San Francisco means
the saving of five days' time over the Panama route and canal, and
also the saving of canal, tolls.
Gwin's great plan was In the interest of California commerce.
It brought the scheme to the attention of Mexico, and his dreani
is in effect realized long after his death. The harbors on each side
of the isthmus of Tehuantepec are safe and ample, and Mexico has
established within her own borders an important commercial fa
cility for the trade of the world, and a very effective check on the
tolls of the canal itself when it is completed.
â¢ J This new transcontinental route has up to this time attracted
but little attention, because every one is looking toward the canal.
But its effect upon commerce on both sides of the continent is sure
to soon become very apparent. ' â¢
THE WATERS AND FORESTS SOCIETY.
.n^HE meeting of the Waters and". Forests Society in its annual
I convention in this city is an important event. The forestry
* statute, passed by the last Legislature, should be by this time
sufficiently digested to permit opinions upon its fitness for the pur
pose for which it was designed. The stripping of the mountains has
gone so far that we have a season of unusually large rainfall on the
range followed by early and prolonged failure of springs and of
water for mining. Miners have long been idle and without wages,
and mine owners have been without returns. -The ax has been put
at the root of their prosperity and what it deadened fire has de
stroyed. V 1V 1
The society will have to decide whether the - new law meets
those conditions and promises their abatement. We must soon pre
pare not only for preservation of the forests that are left, but for
the reafforestation of the mountain slopes that have been so prodi
gally stripped of their timber.
The society must also look into the conservation of the ground
waters of the State. These are being unlawfully and prodigally
wasted like the forests. The subterranean reservoirs" -are being
tapped by hundreds of artesian wells that are not used potably, nor
to produce cropsÂ»_ Ever since 1876 the law has required such Wells
to be capped, but that law is permitted to remain a dead letter' by
the country officials whose duty is to enforce it. The Supreme Court
has decided that it is unlawful to uselessly deplete the waters of ,a
well that is of beneficial use in raising crops.- y.This decision settles
the issue between the parties to the case^ but it also applies to all
cases that are on all fours with it, and there are hundreds of them.
But the sufferers should. not be put to the expense of going. into
court, when it is made the duty of county officials to enforce the law
and stop the waste. The Waters and Forests Society should appoint
a law committee to- sec that this is done.
MORMON REFORM.
IT is announced, with rather suspicious eagerness. and ostentation,
that President Smith of the Mormon church has peremptorily
refused to sanction polygamy, even in the Mormon colony in
Mexico. Mr. Conger was a member of Zion in full standing and duly
married to one wife. His, fancy craved another and. number one
assented. Thereupon he took intended number two and fared* to
Mexico, domesticated himself in the Mormon colony and prepared
a house with a door for each^wife, and itnade ready,' f of a'dualfes
tablishment graced. by three- souls with but. a, ; single thought.- three
hearts that beat as one. . Just then President Smith appeared in/the
colony on a tour of pious r inspection, and* not only denied >td; Mr.
Conger all the comforts of a home, but excommunicated and cast
him into outer darkness.^ Conger's feelings ;are, hurt. President
Smith has five wives and forty-three children to his credit, and the
whole live in domestic peace and' harmony in .Salt Lake, makirigfhis
domestic establishment look like a nest of sociable birds of- plumage
gay. Being full jeweled in that respect, Mr. Conger deems that the
president has treated him with unjust discrimination^

BROOKLYN GIRL HAS A REMARKABLE
CAREER IN WALL STREET.
Makes Fortune by
Selling Tips ;on

otocks.
Is Now Interested
in Mines in
THIS is the story of how a Miss
Xellie R. Conkling-, a Brooklyn
girl, made a fortune. It. begins
when a little waif in an institution was
adopted by the matron and brought up
I iis her own daughter. She was a quiet,
modest child v.'ho talked in a v low,
pleasant voice and seemed the last girl
in the world to have a future outside
the Home. But a few years in the pub
lic school and a few lessons from a
clergyman's wife in shorthand inspired
the girl to become a typewriter, and to
the surprise of her friends she pro
cured a position in the office of a Wall
street broker, who, by the: way, be
long^ to a lot of clubs and is one of the
pillars of Tammany Uall.
The financier, a man of experience,
who thought he knew all the tricks of
the street, was sailing along, in high
prosperity, when a deal in Alaska
properties .manipulated by a man on
the spot nearly bankrupted him.. Ha
was the most astonished man in forty
States. . . *\u25a0 '
Meanwhile his little black-eyed
typewriter had actually made money
on several little stock transactions and
one day her employer said: "You're a
mascot. You'd better go into busi
ness." - : \u25a0 . ..--ViK;.
"I have sold friends several tips,"
she said, "which I picked up . around
the office, and they have made money
and given me a share In the profits."
To say that the astute and experi
enced broker was surprised' does not
half express it. "You had better keep
right on," he said. "You'll make a for
tune yet. and I think another Alaska
venture will finish me for life." ~~-
The soft- voiced typewriter took the
joking advice in earnest and straight
way sent out a circular letter offering
tips, on the market and asking no pay
if they proved worthless. Her terms
were 10 per cent of the stock pur
chased by the a *ubscriber. he to carry
her share of the stock bought, keep
up her margins, etc. Result: About
two-thirds of her tips were correct,
and money began coming in from all
parts of the country in letters ' ad
dressed tb the little typewriter.
The first returns of $1500 in the morn-
Ing's 'mall nearly paralyzed the office.
The Tammany Hall financier buckled on
his best diamonds, gave ah extra polish
to his silk hat and went to the Demo
cratic Club to tell the news about his
Arabian Xights typewriter. "What's the
use of knowing anything?* Experience
don't count in Wall Istreet. A Brooklyn
girl knows more of stocks than the old
timers of the Exchange."

Conkling said when'^interviewed at her
home, "and used my ; Brooklyn sense in

me tips which/ panned out wonderfully
and would have made'money for him if
he had followed them himself. -'Of .course
all my predictions did not win, but two

ceived $8000 from clients between; Pitts

"Are you still In the business?",-
"No," replied the girl; "I made money
bo easily that I determined to enlarge my

CLAUSE VALID
Judge Coffey Sustains the
Will of the Late Mil
lionaire John S. Doe
DEFEAT FOR THE WIDOW
retition for Distribution to
Her and Her Daughter
Is Denied by the Court
The trust' provjilons of the will of
the late John S. Doe have successfully
withstood attack. Yesterday they
were declared valid by Superior Judge
J. V. Coffey. This means that so long
as Bartlett DoÂ©, surviving trustee un
der the will, remains of this world, the
decedent's widow, now Mrs. Eleanor H.
Stetson, and her daughter. Mary Mar
garet Doe. must be content with the
Income of the bulk of the estate, val
ued at nearly j:.000,000.
John S. Doe died January 21, 1894,
leaving his widow, a daughter, two
brothers, two sisters, several nephews
and nieces and other collateral kin
dred. To his collateral heirs he made
specific bequests, but devised the bulk
of his estate in trust to the then Mrs.
Doe, his widow, and their ' daughter,
Mary Margaret. Named as trustees in
the will were Bartlett and Charles S.
Doe and the testament provided that
so long as both or either of them lived
the trust was to remain in full force
â¢tr.d effect.
Half of the income of the trust es
tate was to go to the widow of the
deceased and the other half to the
daughter. In event of tbe death of one
the entire income was to go to the
other, arrtl in event of the death of both
collateral helra were to benefit. No at
tack was made on the trust until after
the death of Charles S. Doe, one of the
Trustees. :'.v;. ";
Then Mrs. Stetson, represented by
Attorneys Charles S. Wheeler and J. F.
Bowie, filed a petition for final distri
bution to the beneficiaries under the
trust of the property included in the
trust. It was contended that the trust
was invalid in that it was against tbe
code; that it provided for the accumu
lation of -property in a manner that
conflicted with the statutes governing
alienation and that in other particu
lars it did not conform with the law.
The trust provisions were defended
by Garret W. McEnerncy and Heller &
Powers, representing the surviving
trustee, Bartlett Doe, who contended
that the trust as established under the
testament conformed with every pro
vision of law necessary to maintain it
inviolate. Judge Coffey has upheld the
position of the defense and holds that
the trust is valid and fully within the
law.
It is probable that an appeal will be
taken by the contestants.
UECLAUES THE JEWS ARE
A DISORGANIZED RACK
Dr. Henry Epsteen Malceit Assertion
Before a Meeting of tbe Help
era of Zion.
An enthusiastic meeting was held by
the Helpers of Zion Sunday night at B'nai
B'rith Kail. Several prominent speak
ers addressed the audience. Among
them were Dr. Henry Epst^en, Jerome
Kabn and Dr. *S. Reynolds of Salt
Lake. A circular was read from the
Jewish Defense Association and Inter
national Relief Committee asking the
members of this body tr aid the Jewish
sufferers in Russia.
Dr. ISpsteen said in part: "THe
greatest work that this society has
done is to bring the Jewish people of
all kinds and classes together. Zion
ism to some degree organized the He
brew people. The Jewish people are
The most' disorganized people on the
face of the globe. We have our geo
graphical differences. We have our
gentlemen Jews and Russian Jews and
French Jews and English Jews and
American Jews. We have them In
classes â the rich, poor and otherwise,
and the heartrending part of it all is
that every class of these Jews hates
every other class. . That is a terrible
state of affairs. It is a state of affairs
that will have to be done away with.
We Jews must realize that we are all
from tho same family. We must learn
to love each other and stand shoulder
to shoulder."

GRAPE-NUTS.
A LITTLE SPOONFUL
Better Than a Piece of Meat Blj? as lI In
"I can do more hard \u25a0work on one lit-
tle old spoonful of Grape-Nuts than I
can on a slice of meat as big as my
hand."
It was this remark, made by a n^ig-h-
bor, who is a conductor on the -Santa
Fe Railroad, that, first" Induced 'me, to
try Grape-Xuts food; and now that I
have tried it I am Quite with him Jn.his
high appreciation of what I regard as
the most perfect food production on the
market to-day.
The letter comes from \u25a0Wellington,
Kas., and the writer continues:
"My neighbor said 'be was worn out
from ' worklni? nights and eating: all
kinds of stuff at all hours of the day
and night, until his condition compelled
him to take a 'lay off.* Then he began
to cat Grape-Nuts, and says that from
that moment his strength rapidly re-
turned to him. He is now working
eleven hours a day and does not feel it
"I was glad be told me, for I had been j
suffering for a long time from stomach
trouble which came from food that was
not suited to me. I had been compelled
to give up my housework for a time,
and that was a great hardship to me,
for X hate to have a hired girl around
the house.
"Very soon the benefits of the change
In my diet began to manifest them-
selves; my stomach was restoredâ the
Grape-Nuts seemed to go right to work
to putting it in order again, and now 1
can eat anything. My strength came
back to me/and In a little more than a
month I. was able to let the hired girl
go. For more than 3 months now I
have been doing all my housework, and
you will understand that that is no
small matter - when I tell you that I
have a family of six to do for, my old-
est child being f and my youngest only
I months. \
"I actually feel better,- doing all that
work on Grape-Nuts Pood, than I did In
years I ate greasy food and had a
girl to take the burden off of me.*

JORDAN WOULD
CHANGE RULES
Head of Stanford Universit} r
Says Professionals Must
Be Kept Out of the Game
BOYS SHOULD NOT PLAY
Noted Educator Is in Favor
of Fostering Football, but
Suggests Several Changes
SpacUl Dispatch to Tbe Call.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY. Nov. S7. â
President David Starr Jordan returned
yesterday from the East, where he at
tended the conference of the trustees
ct the Carnegie fund In New York
City. While absent he made addresses
at many towns and also conferred
with President Roosevelt concerning:
the Alaska Fish Commission. He has
Issued. In addition to statements pub
lished In Collier's Weekly, his opinion
of tbe football question,, which is now
the topic of bo many university pro
lessors, due to the number of fatali
ties. The head of tbÂ« university, al
though not taking an aggressive stand
one way or the other, shows where the
changes must be made and also limits
the game to youths of oertaln ages.
Ea admits the game has many good
Joints and is against the complete
annihilation of the famous pastime. His
statement in part Is:
"Most football accidents occur in seo
end&ry schools. Football matches In
â¢uch schools should be discouraged.
LÂ«t the boys play with each other.
The game needs some changes toward
simplicity and reduction of strain.
What changes will make a better game
experts must decide. The greatest
present evil rests upon professionalism,
the playing of outside toughs under Ir
responsible coaches, to the end of vic
tory at any price. No man who has
not done a man's work as a student
cnould play. No one should play In
more than four or five Intercollegiate
, -games in one season;' a dirty player
should be permanently, ruled off the
\u25a0field, and college authorities should
make a gentleman's agreement ' that
each man uMng tbe college name is a
bona fide student and amateur. The
game, with all Its faults, has enormous
usefulness, which should not be given
up without a resolute effort to clear it
from parasites and abuses. For all
these, in the last analysis, the Indif
ference of college authorities Is re
sponsible."
CARNEY HANDILY DEFEATS
RUSSELL IN A POOL GAME
Expert From St. Ixmla L>osea Before
He Is Well Warmed
Vs.
The pool tourney for the champlon
â¢ chip of the Pacific Coast, started at the
. Bavoy last night, the opening game
groing to J. W. Carney by a score of
125 to the SI made by T. G. Russell of
Bt. Louis. Russeli was slow to get go
ing and Carney was soon hopelessly in
the lead, but as the game progressed
the loser made many brilliant shots.
Carney played well in spots and
seemed careless at times, but withal
showed his great speed and ability.
To-night William George will cross
cues with W. W. King, and as they
are closely matched, a great contest is
expected. Wednesday night Champion
George Becker will meet Robert Upton.

MUDLARKS COME HOME EARLY AND OFTEN
ATHLETIC FIELD
FOR OLYMPIANS
Members of the Winged "0"
Practically Decide on the
Half moon Bay Grounds
WILL PURCHASE TRACT
More Than $60,000 Is to Be
Laid Out on the Oval to
Make It Finest in World
The Olympic Club will shortly have
one of the finest outdoor athletic fields
in the world, at Half moon Bay. That was
practically "decided yesterday afternoon,
when the 1 board of directors met at ' the
home of the "winged O" and ail but de
cided upon a tract of land near where
the new electric road will end at the
suburban retreat.
Most of the Olympic Club directors
favor the new place. A proposition ; was
made by the railroad company to present
a twenty-acre tract, of land to the club
for a site on which to build the athletic
field, but Leader John G. Gleason and
his followers strongly, objected to this
plan, saying that, the Olympians were
etrong and rich enough to purchase a
tract of land for themselves and did not
need the assistance of any outside cor
poration.
After a lively discussion it was' decided
to' refer the matter, to. another meeting
of the committee, but as most of the di
rectors seem in favor of purchasing the
twenty-acre tract at Half moon. Bay it
looks as though the deal were about as
good as closed.
According to the present plans of the
directors of the "winged O" more . than
$60,000 will be spent on the new field to
make ' it the finest of its kind in the
world. There will be nothing lacking
when the new grounds are completed.
There. will be a track, an sathletic. oval, a
baseball diamond, a football gridiron and,
in fact, everything that goes to make up
a modern athletic field.
The committee in charge of the Christ
mas jinks under the auspices of the club
announced that it had secured an abund
ance of talent and was practically ready
to announce the programme of the big
social event for the members of the club
and their friends. A number of renowned
entertainers outside of the members of
the club will contribute to the pro
gramme. Rehearsals will begin shortly
and a very successful entertainment is
looked for.
MANY FAST AMATEUES
DON MITTS TO-NIGHT
Occidental Club Signs Up a
Number of Promising
Boxers.
A big boxing carnival will be pulled off
this evening at Woodward's Pavilion by
the Occidental Club. The card is an ex
cellent one and comprises bouts between
boxers of almost every weight. The main
event will be a four-round set-to between
Jack Rodney, the Ocean View terror, and
Tom Barry, brother of Dave Barry. The
boys are billed to fight for the amateur
lightweight championship, and should put
up a great battle.
George Earley and Jim Ford are on the
books to settle the feather-weight grudge.
Both boys are in good fighting trim and
are looked upon as comers. Harry Baker
and Frank Edwards have been matched
for bantam honors and should give a
good account of themselves when they
climb into the ring".
The rest of the card is made up as fol
lows: Jim Gallagher vs. Charley Phlpps,
Frank Baroni vs. Johnny Murphy, John
ny Carroll vs. Tony Baroni. Phil Wand
will referee all the contests. .
DOCTOR GIVES STRYCHNINE
TO A FOOTBALL PLAYER
Action of a Spokane Medical Man
Causes Much Comment In Ath
letic Circles.
SPOKANE, Nov. 27. â The. use of
strychnine as a stimulant has been re
sorted to In the Spokane High School
football team. Its use is . admitted by
Coach Smith, who justifies this course
because it was prescribed and adminis
tered by Dr. R. N. Tooker, the regular
doctor of the high school team. In
view of the fact that the administer
ing of any stimulants is strongly con
demned by most college and profes
sional coaches, the fa^t that the use
of strychnine is approved by the man
agers of the high school team has
caused lively comment to-day.. : .
"It Is true strychnine was adminis
tered to Meyers, half-back of the team,
on the occasion of the Spokane-Lewls
ton game in, this city." said : Coach
Smith to-day. "It was given hypoder
mlcally by Dr. t Tooker, the team's phy
sician. He first made an examination
of Meyers' injuries and took special
pains to ascertain the action of the
heart before administering it."

SLOPPY GOING AT OAKLAND HAS
SPECULATORS GUESSING.
Bountiful, a Son of
Old Lucky Dog,
Is a Surprise.
Byronerdale Beaten
by Schreibers
Buchanan.
FRED B. HULUOLLAXD.
The muddy going at Oakland yesterday
had the talent guessing from the jump,
and. uDsets were frequent and expensive.
The crowd cashed on, but" two favorites,
Lurene and Gorgalette. Bountiful and
Laura P M were the longest priced win
ner of the afternoon.
Taking as a line her very tame show
ing in a race last Thursday, when quoted
at short odds, it is not surprising . the
books laid 10 to 1 about Mazel in the
opening scramble for two-year-olds ; yes
terday. ,-â She was ridden by McÃride, and
taking the lead early won by herself at
the close. . Prince Nap, the post favorite,
came ' from the far j rear, beating Frank
Flittne^for the place.
No fault could be found with Lloyd
Fountain's handling of Lurene, the 8 t0. 5
choice for the six and a half furlong
selling number. /.. He picked a good posi
tion with the mare, and moving into the
lead before the streach was reached, de
feated the 50 to 1 shot, Swift Queen, half
a length. Barney Schrelber's Bertola
ran third, after a brief stay out in front.
Bountiful, a daughter of the gay old
mud lark. Lucky Dog, annexed the six
furlong run, - also decided under selling
conditions. The mare seemed as fond of
the sloppy footing as a colored gambler
is of a pure white stone, and nicely rid
den by Graham, came home three lengths
before The Reprobate and Haven Run.
The former was slipDed ; around *as the
real chocolate, but grew wobbly after
cutting out the running. The ring laid
20 to 1 about the winner.
Barney Schrelber's , clever apprentice
Schade stole the mile and a sixteenth
selling fixture with his employer's .light
weighted three-year-old Buchanan. By
ronerdale, the mount of "Big Bill" Knapp,
with 105 pounds to negotiate, looked as
appetizing as a Kosher, sausage, ana
every 1 seven out of ten unloaded right
there at odds of -7 to 10. While Knapp
was dreaming, softly dreaming, in second
position with the favorite, Schade opened
up such a gap of daylight with Buchanan
that Byronerdale fell short at the finish
by more than two lengths. The show
went to Bannock Belle, a 15 to 1 shot.
There was no mistake about Laura F
M. being ready yesterday. The bush con
tingent was out with bells on and . spon
gobbled ud all the 10 to 1 in sight. The
form players unloaded on *Ed Lilburn,
forcing the Magrane horse's odds down to
9to 10. Epicure appeared uncertain about
his underpinning and the price lengthened
to 2iÂ£. Laura F M fairly reveled In the
mud and made aspreadeagle affair, of it,
downing the favorite In a great big can
ter. Jack Keene's Mafalda finished an
ordinary third at 15 to 1. â¢
After a good deal of see-sawlng Gorga
lette, with McÃride up, went to the post
favorite for the closing mile run. There
was no pace to speak of during the race,
and after Angleta had blown up McÃride
assumed the leading position .with his
mount. The chestnut mare held Ink safe
at the end, winning by a length. , Davis
was third with St. George Jr. . ~
NOTES OF THE TRACK.
McÃride and Lloyd Fountain rode in
good form, each piloting: two winners.'
Frank Graham rode his first winner
of the meeting when he landed Bounti
ful. He is due to get a move on now.
Treubel, who piloted a number Â»of
winners at Oakland last spring, is here
again. He will be able to do 105 pounds
In the saddle. -
Bookmaker Joe Rose mixed with the
crowd in the ring yesterday. Joe had
a very successful season East and will
cut in at Oakland to-morrowl ; ! \
Twelve yearlings owned by Tommy
Griffin reached Ingleside" yesterday
from the East. . : â. .
J. Ransch passed through San Fran
cisco Sunday on his way to Bakersfield,

MAY PUT BAN

Chicago Alderman Frames
Up Eesolution to Prohibit
Game in the Windy City
TOO BEUTAL A SPOET
Action Taken Too Late to
Prevent the Big Contest
Billed for Thanksgiving
CHICAGO, Nov. 17.â Alderman Harris
of the Ninth Ward to-night Introduced to
the City Council : a resolution; requiring
Corporation; Counsel James -Hamilton
Lewis to prepare an ordinance prohibiting
the playing; of Intercollegiate football In
this city â¢ until- the rules regulating the
game have been modified and changed to
eliminate the ' present danger of serious
injury to players. The resolution was re
ferred \u25a0to the committee on health. The
resolution' is as follows:
â "Whereas, numerous . casualties have
been reported f fronv football â¢ games this
season, where a ' number of deaths and
serious injuries . occurred among the par
ticipants; and .
'/Whereas, the game -as.lt Is played at
the present time has been condemned by
President" Roosevelt and the professors
I of various universities and colleges as a
game of brutal and of unnecessary rough
; ness where the lives of players are Jeop
ardized ; therefore, .
'â¢Be It ordered, that the Corporation
Counsel be and Is hereby directed to pre
pare and to submit to this Council an
ordinance prohibiting college football . In
this city, until the rules regulating said
games are so revised as to eliminate the
element of danger that now prevails."
To-night's action by the City Council
does not In any way affect the game here
Thanksgiving between the Universities oJ
Michigan and Chicago, as the Council
does not meet again until next Monday.
BANGS CONDEMNS FOOTBAIX.
Columbia Professor Term* It a "Brutal
' and Abominable Game."
NEW YORK, Nov. 27.â Francis S.
Bangs, chairman of the Columbia Uni
versity committee on athletics, to-day
pronounced football as played under
the present. rules and methods "a bru
tal and abominable game," and said
that if he had his way it would be pro
hibited. Speaking of the rules com
mittee appointed a number of years
ago" by the- now defunct University
Athletic Club, Mr. Bangs said its mem
bers "are irresponsible, Impervious to
public opinion and culpable In their
disregard of the increasing danger, of
the game as they have made it." He
declared that they had done nothing to
better conditions , agd that he did not
think the revision of the rules could
be entrusted to them now with any
confidence. Of - a - proposition- made
some months ago to 'refer the question
of stopping football to the athletic as
sociations of the. various universities,
Mr. Bangs said:
"You might as well trust. the cook-
Ing of>a steak to a cage full of <lions."
President .Butler said- that he was
not yet ready to make a statement for
publication, but that the views of Mr.
Bangs appeared to him to be entirely
sound. The -University Council several
years ago authorized the president to
appoint a university committee on stu
dent organizations, athletic and other
wise, which in any way represent the
university : before the public. It is in
the power of this committee to take
whatever action on the question which
seems to them wise.
It was said to-day at Columbia, ap
parently on good authority, that Presi
dent Butler has only awaited the end
of the football season before calling
this committee together and urging
them peremptorily to forbid the fur
ther participation of Columbia students
in the game of football as it is played
at present. - ;>.>'.;\u25a0\u25a0
KEAENEY WAXES WARM
ON WITNESS STAND
Issue of Veracity Between
| [Him and Is -
Eaised/
Dr. Peter A. Kearney, who is suing
Mrs. Theresa Bell for $25,000 for med
ical services he alleges he performed
at" her request, waxed ; exceedingly
warm yesterday .under the imputation
that he had told certain persons < that
the family plate of. the Bell household,
now in his possession, was simply held
by him as a trustee and; was not ac
cepted in part payment of the large fee'
he 'demands.
; "Whoever said . that I ' said that ut
tered a notorious lie," declared the doc
tor Indignantly/: from his position on
the witness stand. - ]
"Your language Is .improper," inter
rupted Judge Hunt sternly. "It la not for
you 'to "say who are liars and who'are
not, .'but \u25a0 for- the jury to decide. Any
further indulgence in such language
will lay you open to a heavy fine." Dr.
Kearney subsided.
; The issue of veracity was then clear
ly drawn between Dr. 'Kearney and
Mr. and Mrs. L. M. Sherwood, at whose
home : the \u25a0 late Mammy Pleasant .died.
Both Mr. and Mrs. Sherwood testified
that r Dr. - Bell called at their home to
view Mammy's body and that .while
there he said: . \u25a0
/= "Strange" has' been this woman's Ufa
and her connection with the Bell house
hold. â¢ 'I : fear . that Mrs.*: B el 1 is 1 os ln g
her mind and that it .will not be long
before she will require | the attention | of
a guardian. She has reached that state
where ,' she Is "selling ; all of : her keep-
Bakes and household effects. I have in
my home under * lock and key a large
quantity- of silverware -which I have
takenslmply :for. the purpose of pre
venting Mrs. -Bell from making away
with it."
:. Mrs. Bell steadfastly denies that she
gave the plate to* Dr. Kearney in part
payment of ;his' fee,' but asserts, that she
simply gave it- to him, as 'â¢ Mr. "\u25a0 and Mrs.'
Sherwood \ testified } he 'admitted to them
that she did, for; safe* keeping and that
alone. .The t ease â¢ goes ' on again to-day.

Danish Ship.Copley
Has Tough Time
Off Horn
Th* Occidental and Oriental liner
l>o:ic arrived yesterday from the
orient a day late. The time was lost
between Honolulu and hero. After
leaving the Island port heavy weather
was encountered and the tempest raj?ed
Â«H tho way to the Golden Gate. Big
yeas svrrpt the decks, green water fly
ing 1 over the bridge, and spray â¢wetting:
the trucks at the mastheads. For the
passengers it was a good time to keep
off the decks, and officers and crew had
ih.'ir hiind? full looking out for the
ship. The wind was in the Doric's
T.-^th nearly all -the time and. although
ihf engines were working hard enough
tv send Urn vessel ulongr more than 300
miles' In a. day, the handicap was so
hea\ v y that some days she made little
more than- 200. - - - â¢
No damage was done to the liner,
however, and nobody was hurt, al
though several members of the crew
narrowly escaped trouble from some of
the seas which played about the decks.
Chief Officer^ Gaukrogrer's ruddy Brit
ish countenance was rosier than ever
*lÂ£ ;i result of exposure to the weather.
Among the passengers from the
Orient was Otis A. Poole, the big tea
man. This is the fortieth time Poole
has crossed the Pacific, and more than
thirty of his voyages have been made
on O. and O. ships.
Another passenger was C. C. Chopp,
â¢who says he is a banker from Cleve
land, Ohio. Chopp declares that the
anti-American boycott Is still active In
China. He says that if Japan haa
nothing to do with instigating it it is
at least profiting by it now. Where
American products have been shut out
by the boycott. sayÃ Chop, Japan is
forcing her own goods and when the
boycott Itself is a thing of the past
liui Yankee trader will have to fight
Japan out of the Chinese market be
fore he can get back the trade the boy
vott has sent glimmering. It will be
tÂ«n years, declares Chopp, before
American trade can be rebuilt to the
balk of anti-boycott days, and It will

New York Stock Market.
N'CW YORK. Nov. 27.â The n>eculativft spir
it to-day showed itself entirely indifferent to
any development of affairs which did not point
the way that the general enthusiasm ran.
Fuch Incidents as the crumbling away of the
prices or the Rock Island stocks to-day or the
renewed weakness In. Russian pecuritie* abroad
have been sufficient at times In past experi
ences cf the stock market to put an effective
check on the speculative movement ani Induce
a reversal in the course, of prices. But to-day
thÂ» sensational advances continued to occur
here and there In the market with scarcely
any attention being paid to these occurrences.
A very heavy digettlon of profits was effected,
which is a weakening process on the lechr.lcal
position of the trading in Itself. The flare of
jricea in the immediate opening after last
week's considerable gains and expansions of
activity might have been disquieting, aÂ« Mich
a demonstration 1* looked upon as a likely
sign of a culmination in a speculative move
ment and as precursor of reaction. These and
â¢'.1 other signs were ignored In the determined
Jrirting of speculative operations to-day. The
-<%\u25a0 - ar.tial recuperation of the banking poel
ton disclosed by the Saturday bank statement,
the fact that it was obtained by actual replen
ishment of cash reserves and the easier ten
dency in the day's money market seemed to
ox-erwhelm all other considerations. Special
development* helped some stocks' and vague
surmises of developments were even more ef
fective in other*. The Southern Iron group
was a notable example. On top of wide ad
vances already achle\~ed and substantial evi
dence tr.d an eagerness to take profits as shown,
especially In Tennessee Coal, this morning, the
stocks Sn the group developed renewed antma
tion and Jumped in a lively manner. Smelting
and Lead prored a gainer under the ready con
trol of the market managers of theee stocks.
In the general list the movements were much
less conspicuous and there was a eteady process
cf profit taking which prevented some stocks
from rising higher than the opening. This was
notably tlrue of Union Pacific and United
States Steel stocks. The sluggishness In these
was offset by the strength developed, first In
Â£â¢â. Paul and a number of others in succession.
Atchison enjoyed a vigorous advance as a re
sult of its strong showing of earnings for Oc
tober. A further rise in the price of Copper
here ant! in . London .avraJceaed a movement -in
Amaicamated Copper. There was a violent re
covery In fome of ' the buoyant industrials In
thÂ» final dealings to the best prices of the day.
but the cloFingr tone was somewhat irregular,
under the effect of profit taking.
Rock Island bonds were weak In sympathy
with stocks. Otherwise price* were very well
hfia. Total GalÂ«s. par value, $3,015,000.
United States bends were all unchanged on
rail. -.

THE COPPER STOCKS.
BOSTON. Nov. 27.â A rise of two points In
London price for copper gave great enthusiasm
to our market to-day and the buying all
through the list was the best seen for a lo.jg
time. The smaller Lake coppers were moro
active than they have been lately and will
probably come In for another share of publlo
attention before long. The feeling on Franklin
le bullish on account of supposed richness re
cently discovered.
The advance of copper In London puts prices
up to Â£78. The cause for such a big advance
tg not stated yet. *â¢- . -
Th* directors of Copper Range have declared
a regular quarterly dividend of $1 a share, thÂ«
same as the three preceding dividends. \u25a0-.:::

New York Cotton Slarket.
NEW YORK, Nov. 27.â The imarket was
stronger and higher to-day on buying brought
out by the announcement that the bear leader
had covered his shorts. Gossip went so far
as to say that Mr. Price had turned bull, but
this is denied in a formal statement. Buying
was general and largely for the outside ac
count. The speculative short interest is not

who hve Â«old cotton ahead to mills may be

very bullish. ' Farmers are said to be holding.
.Theodore . Price's statement issued late > Bat
crday cays: "I to-day covered the bulk of
my ' short cotton interest. -My reason was
the fear that the forthcoming estimate of. the
Agricultural -Department will Indicate a crop
of under 10,000,000 bales. While \u25a0 I personally
believe In a much -larger, crop and while all
my study of the question supports that belief.
It iftÂ«idle to ignore the fact that the rise of
the cotton crop . has to-day become political
and \u25a0 sectional issues rather, than a statistical
or commercial factor, and political forces are
not among those with which 1 \u25a0 care to con

COLLINS SENT
BACK TO JAIL
Judge Lennon Orders Him
Into Custody After Impan
elment of Jury Commences
LOSES MANY 'MOTIONS
Makes Affidavit That Father
Connolly Would Prove He
Married Agnes 3lt Newman
All the efforts of Attorney George D. t
Collins to postpone his trial on the charge j
of perjury have failed, and yesterday aft
ernoon th*s impanelment of the Jury was
commenced before Judge Lennon of Ma
rin County.
Four jurors Were accepted, and at the
close cf the proceeding* the Judge in
structed Bailiff Walsh to take the de
fendant Into custody. Collins pleaded to
be 'allowed to prepare the subpenas .for
his witnesses and to do other necessary
work, but the Judge told him that was
in .the discretion of the Sheriff. It was
while the jury was beinr impaneled in
the bigamy case that Collins tfed to Vic
toria. B. C. â¢\u25a0 -
When the caW was called yesterday
Celllns filed an affidavit on his motion
for- a postponement of the trial,- in which
he alleged that Rev. Hi I>. Connolly was 1
a material witness for *he defense,, which
expected to prove .by him that Collins'
was married to Agnes M. Newman, on
May 15, ISS9. and 'not to Charlotta -E.
Newman, as alleged by the prosecution;
that Father Connolly ..was at present in
the Btate of New York, and would. return
en December 24; that there .was no other (
witness who coujd prove ; the- facts of the'
raVrrlage. and * that one of r his" defenses i
wis that Agnes was affiant's wife at the;
tljne of her death in UOl^and that he:
therefore did not marry Charlotta. He,j
also objected to hie case or himself being;)
"railroaded." and he reeented the manl-.
festatlon of the attitude of the court..
that was in open hostility to a fair and
unbiased consideration of his rights.
COUWTER AFFIDAVIT FILED.
The ca*e was continued till the after
noon to enable the District Attorney to
file a counter affidavit, which was done.
The affiant was Rev. Cornelius E. -Ken
nedy, who declared that Father Connolly
was with Archbishop Riordan and that
the time of his return was indefinite. He
had received a letter from Father Con
nolly on November 22 stating that the
date of his return was uncertain. Af
fiant also declared that he was familiar
with the handwriting of Father Connolly,
and he had seen the' original certificate
of marriage and the name of the bride
was Charlotta E. Newman and the names
of the witnesses Thomas E. Curran and
Agnes M. Newman.
Collins said the opinion of Father Ken
nedy was of no importance. The records
in regard to the marriage were in a bad
shape, and Father Connolly was the only
on*> who could explain matter*.
District Attorney Byington wanted Col
lins to declare that he could prove by
Father Connolly that he was married to
Agnes instead of Charlotta, and not that
he "expected" . to prove it, but Collins
was evasive. '-\ â¢
The JudE* said there was no positive
assurance that Father Connolly would be
hÂ«>re on December 24 and the motion was
denied.
Collins took an exception and said he
\u25bc.ould bring: Archbishop Montgomery to
court this morning to testify that Father
Connolly would return on December 24,
hut the Judge declined to alter his order.
Colljns then asked for a reasonable
time to subi>ena his witnesses and have
them in court, but the Judge replied that
he had had ample time already.
LAST ATTEMPTS FAIL.
His next move was to offer the records
of the court to show that there were
numerous prisoners in jail waiting trial,
and as he was out on bail the other
cases should have the preference. This
was also unsuccessful, and Collins made
â¢mother motion to transfer the case on
the ground that additional facts had
come to his knowledge of bias and preju
dice on the part of the court, but the
motion -was denied.
Collins had played his last card and the
impanelment of the Jury was begun. The
four jurors selected out of the first twelve
arc W. C. Stadtfeld. 1606 Taylor street;
James T. Hunter/ 442% Ninth street; Ed
ward E. Whaley, 2627 Sutter street, and
Morris Felntuch, 2426 Pine etreet.

Is Jailed. %
JAMES C. CRAWFORD
Inspired by a combination of uxorious
penitence and .delirium, tremens, James
Murphy, blacksmith, tenderly . embraced
aind-. begged ''forgiveness. 'from a richly
gowned. efflgy.-.qf a .woman that: stood in
front of. Max Stockmitz's dry goods store
on-Fourth street, between Howard and
Folsom: Squeezing. the figure until Its
steel-wire frame creaked, and copiously
shedding. tears upon its left shoulder, he
hiccoughed:
"l.ira, frgimme an' (hie) I'll nev'r
drink "nozzer (hie), drop /.slongs'llve."
Thus be was pouring out his repentance
when Patrolman J. .A. Ryan was sum
moned- and requested to remove, him. I â¢
"l>ggO'that dummy,", commanded^ the
officer; endeavoring to enforce the |Â»an
date, but lit Murphy declined to relin
quish his clutch. t'.'j
"Haven't seen (hlo) 'lSx* t'r four (hie)

matron among, the, rapidly -enlarging

"Ain't you- ashamed of yourself; offl-
cer." inauired a facetious teamster who
had stopped his horses to watch the pro
ceeding, "for tryin' to break up a family
in that manner?"
Turning to deliver a withering retort,
the policeman released his grip of Mr.
Murphy with such abruptness as to upset
both that gentleman and his inanimate
captive, and together they crashed to the
sidewalk. Their separation was effected
and the man arrested .while he was en
deavoring to lift the dummy'and;solicit
ously asking if it were injured.
"Ye may (hie) take: me," he magnani
mously" Informed the officer* "but I won't
(hie) let ye take (hie) ,'Liza."
Before Police Judge" Fritz the repen
tance of Mr. Murphy was' undiminished,
but his inebriety had largely, evaporated.
It was the first time he. had stayed away
all night I from his better half since he
married her. â¢he explained, - and if re
leased he would never- again offend in
that way.' ' . .". ' \u25a0 " ' " ;
"I'll see .that he. don't,; Judge," said a

Ten male adults # of Portuguese na
tivity were before Judge Mogan on w a
charge of peace disturbance sworn to
by Police Sergeant Ferral and posse,
who arrested the group as they were
holding 'wassail last Saturday night in
the boarding-house at - East and Ore
gon streets, managed, by Mrs. (Jomez,
whose birthday they were celebrating.
So loud was the vocal " noise, aug
mented by the groaning of an, accor
dion and the squeaking of/ a violin,
that mariners far out on the bay were
unable to hear the fog whistles of the
ferry-boats â at least, so the prosecut
ing policemen averred. ';
MagnanlmouÃly refraining from sub
jecting Mrs. Gomez to the ordeal of
disclosing the exact anniversary of her
natal day the defendants were cele
brating. Judge Mogan dlsmised them
with a severe reprimand.
Judge Fritz gave himself until to
morrow to decide whether the big knife
carried by Hadilu Malianai a Circassian,
carver of wood,' was a .deadly, weapon,
and Judge Mogan dismissed the charge
of threatening to ; kill which xvas en
tered against Themarcuand Dochada,
also'a native of Circassia and a worker
in wood, by Charles Marquis, his em
ployer.
As none of the regular court inter
preters was conversant .with, the Cir
cassian language, the complaining wit
ness, Mr. Marquis, ; accommodatingly,
translated Dochada's \u25a0 defensive plea,
which was to the effect that: he did not
intend to kill, and that hereafter and
forevermore he will be "one honorable
man, also honest." .', t
Mr. Marquis and the Circassians re
cently.came here from Portland, where
they had been .engaged at ; the Exposi
tion, and at 1 o'clock Sunday morning
Dochada rose in revolt against his em
ployer In their common home, at 215%

May Have Power Defined
The . joint Supervisors' Committee on
Streets and : Finance l yesterday consid
ered the petition of the ; United Rail
roads to convert the Sutter, Larkin and
Polk street systems into overhead elec-^
trie -trolley, lines. â¢\u25a0 - :
Representatives of the Sutter Street Im-,
provement Club and a special committee
of citizens who are opposed to the over
head system and desire the . present road
to be converted into an underground elec
tric \u25a0 system , advanced numerous argu
ments insupport of their- plea. , : \ .
Patrick Calhoun of the United Railroads
said his Investigations led him to believe
that the underground.,. system . was; not
satisfactory, particularly in Paris. Cal
houn said that,the only: argument urged
against the overhead system -is that it is
unsightly,' and this objection ; would ; be
removed as far as possible' by the use of
ornamental poles and placing the lamps
thereon, to be. kept lighted ,at the ex
pense of the United Railroads. , , ;
Frank J. Sullivan,, president of the Sut-;
ter^ Street Improvement (Club, said his
opinion after investigations and consulta
tion^ with engineers is that the overhead
trolley systems are things of the past. â¢
SUPERVISORS (MUST BEWARE.
"Any Supervisor who | would vote S to.
place an overhead ; - electric system on :
Market said -Sullivan, Vcould
never show his face again to an outraged
people. Railroads cannot be standardized \
without Market street: We would rather
have a cable road than have the.;. Sutter
street road changed into ansioverhead
system."
Charles, S. Wheeler said In his opinion
the board . has no power to - grant the
privilege, for an overhead system, and
the Supervisors should not pass upon. the
question on 'the- ex-parte statements jof
the railroad officials, who are likely, 'to
be - biased. -Wheeler held } that the . fran
chise for an overhead, electric systeih
must be offered for i sale . to the . highest
bidder; and thÂ« charter. provision relative
to the use of ten blocks on. anyj street by
any railroad company/ would .give the
franchise a value on Nlnth^JLarkln.and
Sutter streets and Pacific avSSue/Wheel
er said it was understood : that tlttrtfhlted
' Railroads had the right td reconstruct 1 the
system as a cable road,* but the privilege
to change the system. Into an. electric
system required j new action on the part
of the Supervisors. .: .
Calhoun at this point stated that It was
the hope of the United Railroads to have
an ; overhead electric system on Market
street and in the entire city. '
J. \u25a0! D. Phelan said that the overhead
system -is offensive, and in view of the
declaration of Professor Zuebelin that a
subway -on -Market /street is one of the
immediate, needs -of ;the> future ; the Over
head system -,1s out, of. the question. .'-He
said that the announcement of the /cor
poration that it desired the overhead sys
tfem on Market \ street sh6uld determlnw
the policy of the j board not to grant the
privilege on Sutter street,- since the Su
pervlsdrs are committed against the main
tenance cf; poles in certain districts.
SYSTE3I 'NOT IFEASIBUBJ.
Calhoun stated that the construction
of the system in part as an overhead sys
tem and In": part as^underground 8 would
not be feasible owing to -.the delay, neces
sitated by the transfer from one \u25a0 system
to another. 4 - 1 '- -.'"â¢ â¢"' ' ,:-'- : .'
. W. H. Hazell held .that this argument
would not apply; 'â¢ as .the transfer would
be' made at .Central avenue, | where It Is
already in vogue. ,<~;: ..
Tirey U. Ford,: attorney for the United
Railroads, held that the Supervisors . have
the power to:' grant ..the privilege" to
change the motive power of a street rail
way system, despite Wheeler's contention
that , they â¢ have not, .and cited ' cases ' in
support of his claim. Ford / said *;the
United Railroads desired to . construct an
up-to-date overhead system, with the best
service, bo as to prevent the tide of travel
to the cities across the^ bay, and "also to
light :fhei streets along the line of the
system.' \u25a0"..'\u25a0â¢\u25a0. :\u25a0'\u25a0\u25a0.\u25a0 ,\u25a0.;\u25a0\u25a0- ; -- ,'
The committee tended p the .discussion by
