zying race began again. For a time all
things were propitious. The two trains
to be met were found, gnugly with
drawn on the sidings at Mavero and
Agriculta, and the station semaphores
beckoned the flying special past at full
speed. Kent checked off the dodsins
mile-posts; the pace was bettering the
fastest run ever made on the Prairie
Divisionâ which was saying a good
But at Juniberg. 27 miles out of Gas

17. the east bound ; .Ume freight, had
left Juniberg at 1 o'clock, having ample
time to make Lestervllle. the next sta
tion Â»ast, before the light engine could
possibly overtake it. But \LeÂ«terviUe
had not yet reported its arrival; for
which cause the agent at. Juniberg was
constrained to put out his stop signal,
and Kent's special came to a stand at
the platform. .

At 12:45 they stopped for water" at
a solitary tank in the midst of the
brown desert. Kent got down stiffly
from his cramped seat on the fireman's
box and wetted his parched lips at the
nozzle of th* tender hose.
"Do we make it. Jar!?" he asked.
"Ay tank maybe so. ain'rf it? Yusi

"Can you make it by 2 o'clock?" he
asked, when the engineer, a big-boned,
blue-eyed Norwegian, dropped thefe
vcrslng lever Into the corner for the
start.
"Don't you let it come to that, as
long a? you have a leg to stand on. Da
vid," he said. Impressively. "An Inter
regnum of ten days might make it ex
ceedingly difficult for us to prove any
thing." Then, as the telegraph office
watcher came to the door a'rid shook
his head as a sign that Boston was
etill silent: "Your time Is up. Off
with you, and don't let Oleson scare
you when he sets 213 in motion. He
is a good runner, and you have a clear
track." '
Kent clambered to the footplate of
the smart eight-wheeler.
"Necessarily," said Loring. "But^TV.1

The general manager was looking at
his watch, and he shut the case with a
snap.
At ten forty-forty on the Saturday
morning Kent was standing with tha
general manager on the Union station
track platform beside the engine which
was to make the flying run to Gaston.
Nine hours, of sharp work lay be
tween the hurried conference in Lor
ing's bedroom and the drive to the sta
tion at a Quarter before eleven. Bos
ton had been wired; divers and sundry
friends of the railway company had
been interviewed; some few affidavits
had been secured, and now they were
waiting to give Boston its last chance,
with a clerk hanging over tha oper
ator in the station telegraph office to
catch th? first word of encouragement.
"If the Advisory Board doesn't send
us something pretty solid I'm -going:

CHAPTER X.
"If you will, be patient a little while
longer, I'll go to the wire and try to
find out. I am as much in the dark
as you are."
This last was not strictly true.
Hawk had a telegram in his pocket
which was causing him more uneasi
liess than all the rasping criticisms of
the Xew York attorney, and he -was
rereading it by the light of the corri
dor bracket when a young man sprang
from the ascending elevator and hur
ried to the door of the parlor suite.
Hawk collared his Mercury -before he
cculd ra;i on the door.
"Well?" he queried sharply.
"lt'Â« Just as you suspected â what
Mr. Hendricks' telegram hinted at. I
met him at the station and couldn't do
a thine with him."
Hawk rose.
"No; he is not of the weakening
kind. And, besides, the scheme is his
own from start to finish, as you
know."
"Well, what is the matter, then?"
Falkland took a cigar from his case,
bit the end of it like a man with a
grudge to satisfy, and began again.
"There is a very unbusinesslike
mystery a.bjjut,all this, Mr. Hawk, and
I may as well tell you shortly that my
time is too valuable to make me toler
ant of half-coiindences. Get lo the
bottom of it. Has your man weak
ened ?"
"And the train â the last -train the
other man can come on; is that in
yet ?"
Hawk consulted his watch.
"A good half-hour ago."
"You had your clerk at the station
to meet it?"
"I did."
"And he hasn't reported?"
**Xot yet."
"I've been trying to tel] you all the
evening that I'm only the hired man
in this business, Mr. Falkland. I
can't compel the attendance of the
other parties."
"Well, it's damned badly managed,
as far a-s we've gone." was the ungra
cious comment. "You say the Judge
refuses to confer with me?"'
"Ab-so-lutely."
Hawk wriggled uneasily in hi3 chair.
He was used to being bullied, not only
by the good and groat, but by the
little and evil as well. Yet there was
a rasp to the great man's impatience
that irritated him.
"How much longer have v.e to
v.ait?" he demanded Inipatiently,
â¢when the hands of his watch pointed
to the cuarter-hour after 10. "You've
made me travel two thousand miles
to see this thing through: why didn't
you make sure of having your man
here?"
Late that samÂ» night Stephen
Hawk was keeping a rather
discomforting vigil with a visitor
in the best suite of rooms the
Mid-Continental Hotel In Gaston af
forded. The guest of honor was a
brother lawyer â though he might
fcave refused to acknowledge the re
lationship with the ex-district attor
ney â a keen-eyed, businesslike gentle
man, whose name as an organizer of
vast capitalistic ventures had traveled
far, and whose present attitude was
one of undisguised and angry con
tempt for Gaston and all things Gas
tonian.
Now it chanced that, like all gos
sip, this statement was subject to cor
rection as to details in favor of the
exact fact. It is true that the Gov
ernor, his gigantic figure clad in
sportsmanlike brown duck, might
have been seen boarding the train on
the Monday evening: and in addition
to the ample handbag there were rod
and gun cases to bear out the newspa
per notices. None the less, it was
equally true that the keeper of the
Gun Club shooting box at the termi
nus of the Transwestern** Jump Creek
branch was not called upon to enter
tain so distinguished a guest as the
State executive. Also, it might have
been remarked that the Governor
travelr-d a '.one.
It was about this time." or, to be
strictly accurate, on the day preced
ing the convening of Judge MacFar
lane's court in Guston, that Governor
Bucks took a short vacation â his first
Bince the adjournment of the Assem
bly.
One of the mysteries of this man â
the only one for which his friends
could not always account plausibly â
was his habit of dropping out for a
Cay or a week at irregular intervals,
leaving no dew by which he could be
traced. While he was merely a pri
vate citizen these disappearances fig
ured in the local notÂ°* of the
Clarion as "business trips," object and
objective point unknown or at least
unstated: but since his election the
newspapers were usually more def
inite. On this occasion the public was
duly informed that "Governor Bucks,
with one or two intimate friends, was
taking a few days' recreation with rod
and gun on the headwaters of Jump
Creek" â a statement which the Gov
ernor's private secretary stood ready
to corroborate to all and sundry call-
Ing at the gubernatorial rooms on the
second floor of the CapltoL
Kent took his head out of the cross
seas long enough to answer. By all
means Hunnicott was to obtain an
otker continuance, if possible. And
If, before the case were called, there
should be any new developments, he
was to wire at once to the general of
fice and further instructions would is
6ue.
It was while Kent's head was deep
est in the flood of reorganization that
a letter came from one Blashfield
Hunnicott. his successor in the local
attorneyship at Gaston. asking for in
structions in the Varnum matter.
Judge MacFarlane'g court would con
vene in a week. Was he. Hunnicott.
to let the case come to trial? Or
should he â the witnesses still being
unproducible â move for a further
continuance?
more stenographers to his office force.
Now there is this to be said of such
submerslve battlings in a sea of work;
while the fierce toil of the buffeting
mny be good for the swimmer's soul, it
necessarily narrows his horizon, inas
much as a man with his head in. the
tea smother lacks the viewpoint of the
captain who lights his ship from the
conning tower.
So it befell that while the newly ap
pointed general counsel of the reorgan
ized Western Pacific was bolting his
meals and clipping the nights at both
ends In a strenuous endeavor to clear
the decks for a possible battle royal
at the capital, events of -a. minatory
nature were shaping themselves else
where.
To bring these events down to their
focusing point In the period of transi
tion. It is needful to go back a little;
to a term of the Circuit Court held in
the third year of Gaston the prosper
ous.
Who Mra Melissa Varnum was; how
she came to be traveling from Midland
City to the end of the track on a scalp
er's ticket; and in what manner she
was given her choice of paying fare
to the conductor or leaving the train
at Gastonâ these are aetails with which
we need not concern ourselves. Suffice
it to say that Kent, then local attor
ney for the company, mastered them;
and when Mrs. Varnum. through
Hawk, her counsel, sued for five thou
sand dollars damages, he was able to
get a continuance, knowing from long
experience that the jury would certain
ly find for the plaintiff if the case
were then allowed to go trial.
And at the succeeding term of court,
vhich wa6 the one that adjourned on
the day of Kent's transfer to the capi
tal, two of the company's witnesses
had disappeared; and the one bit of
company business Kent had been suc
cessful in doing that day was to post
pone, for a second time, the coming to
trial of the Varnum case.

anything .with him?"-- : - < > â¢ "TV
s "Oh, I .don't know. I'm .opposed to
the methodâ the bargain and sale plan
âand I know you are. Turn him over
to me If he comes in again."
When Kent had dictated a letter In
answer to Hunnicott's he dismissed the
Varnum matter from his mind, havln g
other and more Important, things to
think of. So on the Friday when thÂ«*
case was reached on Judge MacFar
lane's docketâ but, really, in.it worth
our while to be present In the Gaston
courtroom to see and hear what De
falls. .
When the Varnum case was cal| e Â«
Hunnicott promptly moved for a third
continuance, in accordance with his in
structions. The Judge heard his argu
ment, the old and well-worn one of the
absence of important witnesses, witn
perfect patience, and after listening to
Hawk's protest, which was hardly
more than mechanical, he granted the
continuance.
Â¦ Then, came the afterpiece. Court
adjourned and immediately Hawk
asked leave to present, "at chambers,
an amended petition. Hunnicott waa
waylaid by a court officer as he was
leaving the room; and a moment later,
totally unprepared, , he was In the
Judge's office, listening In some dazed
fashion while Hawk went glibly
through the formalities of presenting
his petition. ,
Not until the papers were served
upon him as the company's attorney
and the.*. Judge was naming 3 o clock
Â©Â£ the following afternoon 'the time
"That's all, then; all but one word.
Your Judge is a weak brother. Notwith
standing all the pains I took to show
him that his action ,would be technic
ally .unassailable, he. was ready to fly
the track at any moment. Have you
got hiro safe?"
Bucks held up one huge hand ..with
the thumb and forefinger tightly
pressed together. 'Â¦Â¦ .
"I've got him- right there." he said.
t : . Â¦ . . ... t : i '.. . c â¢
"Of the three Justices, one of them
was elected on our ticket; another is a
personal friend of Judge MacFarlane.
The goods avIH be delivered." , '
"I've got a man I can hang, which
is more to the purpose. It's Major
Jim Guilford. He lives here; want to
meet him?"
"God forbid!" said Falkland, fervent
ly. He rose and whipped himself into
his overcoat, turning to Hawk: "Have
your young man get me a carriage,
and see to it that my special is ready
to pull east when I give the word, will
you?"
Hawk went obediently, and the New
Yorker had his final word with the
Governor alone.
"I think we understand each other
perfectly," he said. "You are to have
the patronage: we are to pay for all
actual betterments for- which vouchers
can be shown at the close of the deal.
All wa ask is that the stock be de
pressed to the point agreed upon within
the half-year."
"It's going to be done," said the Gov
ernor, trying as he could to keep the
eye-Image cf his fellow conspirator
from multiplying. Itself by two.
"All right. Now as to the court af
fair. If it Is managed exactly as I
liave outlined, there will be no trouble
âand- no recourse for the other fellows.
When I say that. I'm leaving out your
Supreme Court. Under certain condi
tions, if the defendant's hardship could
be- definitely shown, a writ, of certio
rarl and supersede as might issue. How
about that?" .
The Governor closed one eye slowly,
the better to check the troublesome
multiplying process.
"The Supreme Â¦ Court won't move In
the matter. The ostensible reason will
be that th court Is now two years be
hind its docket."
"And the real reason?"
"You won't want to be known in
this, I take it," he said, nodding
at the Governor. "Mr. Hawk
here will answer well enough
for the legal part, but how about
the business end of it? Have you got
a man you can trust?"
The Governor's yellow eyebrows met
in a meaning scowl.
The conference in Falkland's rooms
was chiefly a monologue with the
sharp-spoken New York lawyer in the
speaking part. When it was concluded
the Judge took his leave abruptly,
p'eading the lateness of the hour and
liis duties for the morrow. When he
was gone the New Yorker began
again. Â¦
"Cut that out, too, and come along,"
said the Governor, brutally, and by the
steadying help of the chair, the door
post and the wall of the corridor, he led
lie way to the parlor suite on the floor
below.
It v/as Macquold who apoke, and the
three apparitors, breathing hard, sat
upon the prostate man and bared his
arm for the physician. ."When the
apomorphla began to do Its work there
was a ctruggle of another sort, out of
which emerged a pallid and somewhat
stricken reincarnation of the Governor.
"Falkland is waiting at the hotel and
he and MacFarlane can't get together,"
said Hawk, tersely, when the patient
was fit to listen. "Otherwise we
shouldn't have disturbed you. It's all
day with the scheme If you can't show
up.'"
The Governor groaned and passed his
hand over his eyes.
"Get me into my dothes-^Johnson
has the gripâ and give me all the time
you can," was the sullen rejoinder; and
in due course the Hon. Jasper G. Bucks>
clothed upon and In his right mind,
was enabled to keep his appointment
with the New York attorney at the
Mid-Continent Hotel.
But first came the whipping-in of
MacFarlane. .Eucks went alone to the
Judge's room on the floor- above the
parlor suite. It was now near mid
night, but MacFarlane had not gona
to bed. He was a spare man, with thin
hair, graying rapidly at the temples,
and a care-worn fac"e; the face of a
man whose tasks or responsibiltles. or
both, have overmatched him. He waa
walking the floor with his head down
and his hands â thin, nerveless hands
they wereâ tightly locked behind him,
when the Governor entered. â¢ -
For a large man the Honorable Jas
per was usually able to handle his
weight admirably; but now he clung
to the door-knob until he could launch
himself at a chair and be sure of hit
ting it. . , '
"What's this Hawk's telling me about
you. MacFarlane?". he : demanded,
frowning portentously.
**I don't know what he. has told you.
But it is too flagrant, Bucks;" I can't
do it, and that's all there Is about it."
The protest was feebly fierce, and there
was the snarl of a' baited animal In the
tone.
"It's too late to make difficulties
now," was the harsh reply. "You've
got to do it." '
"I tell you. I can not, and I will not!"
"A late attack of conscience, eh?"
sneered the Governor, who was sober
ing rapidly now. "Let me aak a ques
tion or two. How much was that se
curity debt your son-in-law let you in
for?"
"It was $10,000. It is an honest debt,
and I shall pay It."
"But not out of the salary of a Cir
cuit Judge," Bucks, interposed. "Nor
yet out of the fees, you make your
clerks divide with you. And that isn't
all. Have you forgotten the gerry
mander business? How would you
like to see the true inwardness of that
ir.. the "newspapers? ' ..
The Judge shrank as if the huge ges
turing' hand had struck Mm.
"You wouldn't dare,". he began.' "You
wen; in that too. deeper than â .".'
Again the Governor interrupted him.
"Cut it out," he commenced. "I can
reward, and I can punish. You are. not
going to do anything technically ille
gal; but. by the gods, you are going to
walk the line laid down for you. If
you don't, I shall give the documents
in the gerrymander affair to the papers
the day after you fail. Now we'll go
and see Falkland."
'MacFarlane made one last protest.
'For God's sake, Bucks, 8pare me
that. It Is nothing less than the foul
est collusion between the Judge, the
counsel for the plaintiffâ and the
devil!"
.."Where has he cone?" i â¢ j
"To the same old place." T
"You followed him?"
"Sure. That" is. what kept me bo
long."
Hawk hung upon his decision for the
barest fraction of a second. Then he
gave his orders concisely.
"Hunt up Dr.Macquold and get him
out to the club house as quick as you
can. Tell him to bring his hypodermic
I'll be there with all the help he'll
need." Â»
And when the young man was gone
Hawk smote the air with a clenched
fist and called down the Black. Curse
of Shlelygh, or its modern equivalent,
on all the fates subversive of well-laid
plans.
A quarter of an hour later, on the up
per floor of the club house at the Gen
tlemen's Driving Park, four men burst
in upon a fifth, a huge figure in brown
duck, crouching in a corner like a wild
beast at bay.- A bottle urid a tumbler
stood- on the table under the hanging
lamp; and with the crash of breaking
glass which followed the mad-bull rush
of the duck-clothed giant the reek of
French brandy filled the room.
"Hold him still. If you can, and pull
up that sleeve."

The Shocking: of Hunnicott. . ,
It was two. weeks after the date of
the Governor's fishing trip, and by con
sequence Judge MacFarlane's court
had been the even fortnight in session
In Gaston/ when Kent's attention was
recalled to the forgotten . Varnum case
by another letter from the local attor
ney, Hunnicott. â¢
."Varnum vs. Western Pacific comes
up Friday of this week, and they are
going to press for trial this time, and
no mistake." wrote the local represen
tative. / "Hawk has been chasing
around getting affidavits; for ': what
purpose I don't know, though Lesher
tells me that one of them was 'sworn
to by Houllgan, the sub-contractor who
tried to fight the engineer's estimates;
on the Jump. Creek work. .
"Also, there" is a. story, going the
rounds that the suit is to be made a
blind for bigger game, ' though ! X guess
this is all gossip, based on the fact
that Mr. Semple Falkland's private car
stopped over here two weeks ago, from
S o'clock in the afternoon till midnight
of the same day. Jason, of the Clarion,
Interviewed the New Yorker, and Falk
land told him he had stopped over to
look up the securities on a' mortgage
held by one of, his New York clients."

"Sit down," he' said: and when Kent
had found a chair: "I had a caller this
morningâ Senator. Duvall." . , ,
State Senator Duvall had , been the
father, or. the ostensible father, of the
Senate amendment to House bill 29. He
was, known to the corporations' * lobby
as a legislator;* who would sign a rail
road's Â¦ death , warrant with one hand
and take favors from It with the other;
and, Kent, laughed.
"How "many did he demand passes
for this time? Or was It a special train
he wanted?"
"Neither the one nor the . other, this
morning-, as It happened," said the gen
eral manager. "Not to put too fine an
edge upon it, he had something to sell,
and he wanted me to buy It."
"What, was it?", Kent. asked: quickly.
â¢' Lorlng '.was rubbing his eyeglasses
.absently* with the corner of his hand
kerchief.- . '
"I guess I. made a mistake in,- not
turning him, over to you, David. He
was too smooth for me. I couldn't find
out just what It was he-had. for sale.
He talked vaguely about an Impend
ing < crisis . and a roan who had some
information to dispose of; said the man
had come to him because he was known
to be a firm friend of the Transwest
ern, and so on." v
Kent gave his opinion promptly. .
"It's a capltol-gang deal of some sort
to hold us up: and Duvall is willing
to sell out his fellow conspirators If
the price is right."
Â£ "Have'yquany notion of -what It: isT*

minutes sufficed for the writing of a
telegram, to Kent; and he was halfway
down to. the station with it when It
occurred to him that it would never
do to trust the incendiary thing to the
wires in plain English. There was a lit
tle-used cipher code In his desk pro
vided'for Just such emergencies, and
back he ..went to labor sweating, over
the task of securing secrecy at the ex
pense, of the precious minutes of time.
Wherefore, ." it was 4 o'clock when he
handed, the telegram to the station
operator, and adjured him by all that
was good and great not to" delay its
sending.
It was Just here he made his first and
only slip, since he did not stay to see
the thing done. It chanced that the
regular day operator was off on leave
of absence, and his. substitute, a young
man from the train-dispatcher's office,
was a person who considered the com
pany wires an exclusive appanage of
the train service department. At the
moment of Hunnlcott's assault he was
taking an order for No. 17; and ob
serving that the lawyer's cipher "rush"
covered four closely written pages, he
hung It upon the Bending hook with a
malediction on the legal department for
burdening the wires with its mall cor
respondence, and bo forgot it.
It was 9 o'clock when the night oper
ator came on duty: and being a careful
man. he not only looked first to his send
ing hook, but was thoughtful enough
to run over the accumulation of mes
sages waiting to be transmitted, to the
end that he might give precedenuce to
"Yes."
"Then we have till 11 o'clock to
morrow to prepare. I'll be ready by
that time."
"David, you are a brick when it
comes to the infighting," said the
general manager; and then h'Â« fin

Kent wa,s walking the floor again,
but now the strength of the man was
coming uppermost.
"Never mind; we'll wire 'Boston,
and then we'll do what we can here.
Could you get mp to Gaston on a
special engine In three hours?"
"Haven't we? Don't you see how
nicely the thing is timed? Ten days
later our Transwestern reorganiza
tion would be complete and we could
swear our own officers on the ' spot.
These people know what they are
about."
"Certainly; that is the proper re
joinder â the only one, in fact." said
Kent; then, as a great doubt laid
hold of him and shook him: "You
don't mean to say there Is any doubt
about our ability to do it?"
"Oh. no; I suppose not, if It comes
to a show-down. But I wai thinking
of your man Hunnicott- Doesn't It
occur to you that he is in Just about
as good a fix to secure those affidavits
In Gaston as we are here. David?"
. "Good Lord! Do you mean that
we have to send to Boston for our am

i The abolition of compulsion would
mean the negleqt ef vaccination and
the accumulation of unprotected per
sons in a community, so that in the
Â¦ panic produced by an epidemic vaccin
ation would be overtaxed, with serious
results, and there would be an insuffi
cient supply of lymph. The ignorant
and the improvident, neglect vaccina
tion, as they do' other prudent meas
ures that bear remote results. Many

Â¦it might be well to do away with com
pulsion, as pestilence la one of the
agencies by which overpopulation is
regulated and that It usually picks oft
the weak and those not well fitted to
battle with life.
Statistics showing the' efficacy of vac
cination" seem to be conclusive, but it
will be seen that they differ widely
from those introduced bv anti-vacclna
tionists. Both factions are positive
that figures presented by them are cor
rect. Regard is certainly due to the
opinions of such eminent authorities as
servj>d on the German Vaccination
Commission of 1SS4. In their opinion
the credit of diminishing mortality in
Germany was due to compulsory re
vaccination. Most important evidence
is shown in reports compiled in Eng
land and Wales. Before the introduc
tion of vaccination there were 3000
death3 In every million of the popula
tion from smallpox, while in 1890 this
disease caused only fifteen deaths in
England, and the annual number of
deaths In ten years, 1SS1-00. Inclusive,
was one-seventieth part only of the
death rate of pre-vaccination times. It
is held that vaccination not only great
ly diminished the number stricken, but
that it greatly influenced the death
rate among those attacked. In Shef
field, in the outbreak of 1S37-SS, of 4151
vaccinated patients 200 died, or 4.8 per
cent; of 652 unvacclnated patients 274
died, or 49.6 per cent. If the death rate
of vaccinated children under ten years
of age* during this same epidemic, had
been at the same rate as that of the
unvaccinated there would have been
4400 deaths*, whereas there were only 9
such death3.
In Prussia the mortality from small
pox In the year 1835 was 27 per every
100,000 persons, while in 1886, vacclqp
tion and revaccination being obliga
tory, the death rate was reduced to but
0.39 per 100.000 Inhabitants. Only one
great epidemic has occurred since vac
cination was made obligatoryâ that of
1871-72â while in the preceding century,
there were 32 epidemics. The pro-vac
cinatlonists do not claim that the mild
ness of modern epidemics is due solely
to vaccination. Notification, Isolation
and disinfection are admitted as sup
plementary measures, while the sever
ity and extent depend largely upon
the season, dwelling, mode of life and
care of the skin. *
as it is chimerical and it is as irrational
as it is presumptuous." Another au
thority cited is Dr. Stowell, an English
physician of twenty years' 1 experience,
who says: "The general declaration of
my patients enables me to proclaim
that the vaccination notion is not only
a delusion, but a curse to humanity."
Charles Ruata in the New York Medi
cal Journal July 22, 1899, makes the
startling statement that 3S.5 per" cent
of the population were vaccinated and
yet In the years 1887-88-89 42,272 deaths
from smallpox occurred. In Italy there
were 16,000 deaths, whiie 08 per cent of
the people were vaccinated. The sweep
ing statement is made that "about 60
per cent of all physicians' who have
practiced their professions more than
five years know that vaccination is not
only dangerous, but entirely. Ineffective
as a preventive against smallpox^" -
Many physicians claim that immunity
can be secured by the use of certain
preventive remedies. Revaccination is
Etrongly objected to on the ground that
no doctor is certain from the cicatrix
whether revaccination is necessary or
not. One prominent sneaker cited the
case cf a man who was declared im
mune on account of a remarkably
good cicatrix. when the fact was it
was only the scar from the bite of a
colt. The opposition holds that doctors
who practice it should be made to pay
damages in case of death or disability.
They say that the mildness of modern
epidemics Is due solely to isolation and
sanitation. "The whole world is vacci
nated and yet smallpox exists."
â¢ Statistics from the armies of differ
ent countries are given to prove that
soldiers vaccinated, and revaccinated
many times have not been immune
from attacks of the disease. In fact, it
"is asserted that epidemics begin with
the vaccinated and the revaccinated.
Some of the prominent speakers at
anti-vaccination meetings have been
those whose objection to the practice
Is based upon the loss by death of some
member of the family as a result of
vaccination and it is held that compul
sion under such painful circumstances
Is little less than cruelty. In support
of their opposition to Its continuance
many statistics have been complied to
show the cause of death to have been
from vaccination. It is said that in
England 25,000 children are annually
slaughtered by disease inoculated Into
the system by virus, while by far a
greater number are disabled or Injured
for life. It Is contended that there Is
no definite way for physicians to de
termine the character of the vaccine
used, and that there is no way of test-
Ing the absolute purity of what Is
placed upon the market. In the north
of England a house to house canvass
was made for the purpose of gaining
trustworthy Information, with the re
sult that 750 deaths were alleged to
be due to vaccination, while there were
3135 cases of injury recorded. It is
cited that nine cases of lockjaw oc
curred in Philadelphia In three days.
Another instance mentioned , is that out
of forty' inoculate'd children tilne died
of vaccinia. In? 1885 Â¦ Dr. Andua, a
prominent physician' of Asprieres, vac
cinated forty-two children. .All were
attacked with fever, and six were dead
At tha anti-vaccination meetings it is
pointed out that people suffer from
lack of knowledge and that the theory
of. vaccination has not been strength
ened by virtue of its age.
The most important objections made
to the inoculation of virus as now
practiced by most physicians are that
it cannot be proven that smallpox epl
domics have been lessened by its prac
tice; that vaccine causes the system to
become impregnated with different poi
sons; that there Is an Increased mor-*
tallty from diseases inoculated into
the system by vaccination, and the law
of compulsion is considered un-Ameri
can. It is claimed that vaccination Is
a "risky business" and a "filthy fad,"
which originated* in a dairy maid su
perstition, first promulgated by a bar
ber named Jenner.
To prove its inefficiency such au
thorities as Dr. Charles Ruata, Dr.
Buckner Basel, Dr. Gregory, Dr. Crue
Â¦well, Dr. Stowell and the late Herbert
Spencer are freely quoted. K A numb'er
of periodicals are published In support
of the antl-vacdnat!on theory, notably
the Antl-Vacclnatlon Inquirer of Lon
don and one published in Terre Haute,
Indiana, called Vaccination. Dr. Greg
ory, medical director of the London
Smallpox Hospital, in the Medical
Times of January, 1S52, is quoted as
caying: "The Idea of extinguishing
smallpox by vaccination is as absurd
THE California Anti-Compulsory
Vaccination League is the name
of. a new organization that
threatens California. Its object
is to create a sentiment throughout the
State against the compulsory vaccina
tion of public school children as now
required by the State school law. A
determined effort on the part of those
actively connected wltn this new so
ciety will be made to have the vaccina
tion act wiped from the statutes at the
ccmlng session of the. State Legisla
ture. As the matter now. stands the
law seems to have been thoroughly
tcEted, as the State Supreme Court has
three times affirmed its validity. Many
are satisfied with the law which pro
hibits the attendance at school of chil
dren having contagious diseases.
The most active agitation seems to
have centered in Oakland and Berke
ley, where legal measures have been
taken to restrain the Boards of Edu
cation from enforcing the law. The
school authorities are, however, deter
mined to insist upon strict compliance
with the law, with the result that In
Berkeley 885 pupils of the public
schools were excluded from the class
rccms."
As a result of the antagonism of the
opposing forces, mass meetings have
been held and overcrowded halls have
been proof of the Interest of the com
munities in the agitation.
The purpose of this article is not to
take sides for or against vaccination,
but to present the arguments and sta
tistics introduced by both factions, that
a clear understanding may be had of
tho matter as regarded from different
points of view.
Anti-Vaccination.
American liberty should, grant to

when that freedom should be, to a cer
tain degree, restricted.
erally. Many physicians .-refuse to
practice it at all unless they have a
personal knowledge of the constitution
of the patient. That death Is some
times due to its practice 13 .admitted
by those favoring it, but this' is always
the result of accident. According to the
German commission previously referred
to, "no probable Increase of any par
ticular disease has taken place as the
consequence of vaccination." Any open
sore is liable to infection.; Death IS
frequently caused by no more serious
accident than running a . sliver Into
one's flnger.\ Considering the Immense
number of vaccinations performed and
with the same constant danger of in
fection as to any wound, it Is quite ex
traordinary that so few fatalities occur.
Want of care and absence of antiseptic
precautions or use of human lymph
are causes of infection or poisoning.
Many fatalities' have been traced to
improper cleansing of . the vaccinating
needle. It hag been â¢ definitely deter
mined that only animal lymph should
be used. The great advantage of the
use' of calf lymph" Is that it sweeps
away any suspicion of the inoculation
of other diseases. Syphilis cannot be
communicated to animals. Lymph is
now being prepared from carefully se
lected calves that are quarantined and
closely observed for some length of
time before vaccination, and before
placing the lymph on the market the
animal should be killed and tests made
upon the body to Insure its absolute
healthiness.
Dr. Cory, the director of the animal
vaccination station of the local Govern
ment board, in his evidence before the
royal co-mmlFSion of England states
that from 1SS2-S3 32,002 vaccinations
were performed with calf lymph and
that there were only eight deaths. Of
these only two could be reasonably at
tributed to vaccination, namely, two
cases of wound disease â cellulitis and
erysipelas. This mortality is probably
not even so high as that resulting from
common cuts and scratches.
The case of the loss of six children
out of forty-two vaccinated by Dr.
Andua in 1SS5 is so frequently referred
to by antl-vacclnatlonists. is explained
by P. Bronardel of Paris, who shows
that death was due to the use of hu
man virus. That Leicester, England,
has prohibited vaccination for years,
and ' has escaped a scourge is due
wholly to the fact that it is sur
rounded by a population which is pro
tected by vaccination.
The evidence so far leads to the con
clusion that the best defense of a-com
munity against smallpox is not the re
peal of the law of compulsion, but in
adopting the following measures: The
use of calf lymph only, compulsory pri
mary vaccination In Infancy, occasional
revaccination, isolation of imported
cases of disease, disinfection and sani
tation. The present agitation will tend
to educate the people of the communi
ty, will make physicians more careful
in their selection of lymph, care
of Instruments and cleanliness of
wounds. ' :"V
The existence of the disease in the
United States to-day is due in the main
to individuals who resist attempts for
the protection of the population. No
man is responsible to himself alone for
the care of his own body. An unvae
clnated group of persons in a com
munity are a menace to the health of
the entire population, and it Is con
tended that no one has the right to
endanger the life of the entire commu
nity by refusing to comply with the
law.
The majority of medical practition
ers throughout the world are strong in
their support of the Jenner theory of
vaccination and scarcely consider it
worth while to attempt to refute the
views of the "fanatical anti-vaccina
tion'party." Suaij. authorities. as John
F. J. Sykes of London, John William
Moore of Dublin, Pasteur,. Koch and
Sir John Simons will be freely quoted
in this treatise. The mass of evidence
confirming the protective power of
vaccination and revaccination is Irre
sistible and opposition to it Is due prin
cipally to the objection to compulsion.
The objects of compulsion are the ab
solute necessity of protecting the larg
est percentage possible of the popula
tion for the benefit of. the whole com
munity; ':. to secure. a regular and suffi
cient supply of lymph; to prevent un-
The fact that the town of Leicester,
in England, has prohibited vaccination
and that smallpox has been unknown
there for years is held up as an exam
ple of what all towns would be Svith
out it.
Many of the opposition Justify their
opinions simply upon the ground that
compulsion interferes with liberty and
that taxation without education is tyr
rany. _A strong expression used is that
"rebellion to tyrants is obedience to
God." The claim Is made that the law
was not passed at the instigation of
nor by the wish of the people, but that
it was through the efforts of "a few
political doctors and in the interests of
the vaccine trust."
In refusing to comply with the law,
many agitators express themselves as
being unwilling to become martyrs to
a superstition, to submit to any inter
ference with their religious belief (to
this class belong Christian Scientists,
faith cure adherents and various kinds
of healers), but Insist upon the right
of every American citizen to enjoy that
"American liberty which is supposed
to grant to each and every one freedom
of individual belief and action."

It is contended that no correct, esti-.

this vicious practice, as many fatali
ties are covered up; but it Is responsi
ble for the long death lists of erysipe
las, heart disease, tuberculosis, pneu
monia, kidney 'disease and insanity. In
fact, almost any disease that flesh is
heir to may be attributed to vaccina
tion. Herbert Spencer is quoted as
saying "that the ravages of influenza"
of recent years are directly attributa
ble to vaccination and that la grippe
was never such a menace . to health
until vaccination became almost uni
versal." Infantile syphilis increased in
England, from 1S53 to 18S3, In propor
tion to vaccination. Dr. Cruewell, con
sidered by many a' hign medical au-Â»
thorlty, swore under oath: "Every In
oculation of so-called prolectic pox is
syphilitic poisoning." Thus it is con
tended that even if smallpox has vir
tually been annihilated, general mor
tality has increased, and there is every
recson to attribute this to the practice
of vaccination. " : \-
QUESTION OF COMPULSORY VACCINATION
Boon after this the great chief was

the food was gone. He left Yehl
Quite alone in the hous- and the very
first thing he did was to cut the skin
strings of the box that was harming
from the roof and ict out his uncle's
pretty wife. As she stepped out of
the box two little birds flew out from
under her arms and they at once
guessed that they would fly off to tell
the chief. Sure enough In a few mo
ments he came rushing in, roaring
with rage and called out as loud as he
could, pointing to the sea:
"Let the tide come up."
Higher and higher rose the tide un
til the house was covered, but Yehl
changed himself Into a monstrous
crow and flew up to the sky, where
he hung on the edge of a cloud until
the floods had gone down again.
After this he called a great sea ot
ter to htm and sent him to the bot
tom of the sea, telling him to bring
back a quantity of a certain kind of
fine sand. Out of this sand he made
the world we live in now. When the
â¢world was made it was as bare as the
sand of which Yehl made it. But he
took some seaweed, chewed it up very
fine and spat it out und it grew and
became all the vegetation of the,
earth. Then Yehl made the animals*
and last of all he ma.de men and
women-
He made the first man out of stone,

time the men were light and active.
Some say that Yehl made his man

no one believes this now.
About that time all the fire was on

Once upon a time there was a great
chief. He was of a very wicked nature
and very jealous of everybody, but
most so of his lovely young wife. He
even kept her shut up in a big box,
which he hung from the roof by cords
cf skins. This chief had a sister also,
who had two sons, but both the chil
dren and their mother feared this chief
fcr his cruel ways and hid as far away
as possible. One day, however, he
found them all and instantly killed
both the boys, saying he feared that
when they gTew older they might steal
his wife away.
Then the sorrowful mother fled and
hid herself, crying all day and night
for her pretty boys. In the evening,
as Ehe was weeping, there appeared to
her e crane. She thought the crane
was a man. fcrr so he seemed to her,
while he was really a wonderful magic
crane who could do strange things. The
crane asked her many questions about
her sad fortune and sympathized with
her very kindly. Finally he told her to
choose a Email round pebble from the
â¢bore as clean and white as she could
find and to swallow It. This she did
Â«.nd after a little time she bore a child,
a Â»on, who was the famous Yehl, about

she remembered his wicked uncle and
feared for hlÂ» life. But In less than

xaether was glad and gave him a bow
and arrows and taught him to shoot

fttm cpenly to the house of the great
chief, who, cf course, pretended to be
pleased, but that very moment plotted
to destroy him.
Once upon a time there was no moon
for a long, long time. And the white
people were afraid. They- thought that
the Great Spirit, who had charge of the
sky, was very angrry and mig-ht never
put the moon out any more. And they
were sorrowful, for up there they love
the soft moonlight very much. ,
And so the raven, who .was friendly
to them and also very clever.' offered to
fly.up into the blue and try to see what
â¢was the matter. He went, and was
gone a long while, but was unabte to
find out anything except that the Great
Spirit kept the moon and the stars in a
box and that only he himself had the
key.
Then the clever raven changed him

self at home, and by-and-by the Great
Spirit became as fond of him as any

for the moon and star box to play .with.
But one day the sweet little raven boy
begged so hard and cried so loudly that
he got the coveted box. In the twink
ling of an eye he changed himself into

moon and stars as hard as he could.

"Oh, north wind, please come quickly

And the north wind heard and came
along with such power that he froze all
the streams and started a mass of Ice

Â« Wayup In the great north. on the
very edge of the world, where are the
long silences, the dark days and the
pale, strange midnight sun, there is
one thing more precious than anything
else. It is fire.
â¢ For where flre Is. there life is also:
and where flre is not, there Is death.
- All. this the big bear knows as well as
anybody. But the bear has been the
sworn enemy of the people ever since
there were any, and he watches and
waits with his mad, red little .eyes to
see if he can do them a mischief.
Once it .so happened that all tha fire
in the northland was in the care of Just
two people, an old man and his little
son. They knew its value, however, and
were very careful to keep it always be
tween their hands wherever they went.
They slept watch and watch aboutâ ons
always awake an,d watching tha pre
cious flame.
One night when It was the boy's turn
to sleep the old man grew very weary.
He was too old and could no longer
keep wide awake In the sleepy mow.
And at last he. too. slept quita soundly.
Then the great bear, who had traveled
behind them for a long time, saw his
opportunity. He would steal up and
put out the flre. Then all these hated
people would freeze and ' die and tha
north go back to the old 'quiet* times be
fore the people came, * And- that would
rejoice the bear folk mightily. >r '
So the bear slipped up softly. and put
ting out his enormous flat paws scat
tered the flre far over the snow., And
the two men never wakened. *Â¦ Then the
bear went away, much pleased, and
told the bear folk that the- bad people
were finished forever.
But he had counted without the birds,
who loved the people A much aa the
bears hated them, and who also
watched, but only to help them. And
thus it happened that a little bird who
had followed the men, flying after the
bear, was concealed among the branches
of the firs. As the bear struck out the
flre he caught one last spark upon his
breast, and though It burned deep Into
his breast feathers he kept it and flew
far with it to the people in the south,
where he gave it to them and saved
the land to them to this day. ..
And ever since the spark has been
glowing upon his bosom. And that the
people might remember and be glaoj for
him. they call him the robin redbreast.

Yehl turned himself again Into a ra

a brand in his beak for his people.
"While flying bo far the brand burned
down to his beak and he was obliged

At first Yehl's world was quite dark,

There was a sun and a moon and stars,
but they belonged to a great Prince far
off, who had one lovely daughter. Yehl

born to her that was Yehl himself.

forward to tie, but the steer, having
â¢ time to recover from the force of the
fall, was hind feet up when Halversen
pounced upon him, seizing his tail.
One foot to the left of the steer's hind
legs and a sudden strong pull, and the
steer was down again â all in the space
of two seconds. And then, though there
was the wildest kicking and struggling.
Halverson, bulldog: that he was. tied
his ' animal down and threw up his
bloody arms. He was torn and bruised,
but he had tied his steer. Of course he
could not win; he had been more than
three minutes at the struggle, but the
crowd made up to him for the failure
in the warmth of its reception. It had
been three minutes of such excitement
, as comes in no other sport.
And so, one after another, the con
testants rode forward to the fall of the
flagâ it was a Homeric listâ but one by
one they failed to equal the record of
Buster Graham, although a little red
Scotchman named Moorse came within
six seconds of it. Turk ilcGlory lost
all hope for himself, but ha still felt
brave for 'his hero. But Oliver would
do it if any one could. And it was now
Bud's turn. . He and Bud had been left
to the last. The nearer his time came
the oftener he glanced up to the grand
stand, to the girl in blue and white.
The poolseller was now crying his
-tiame and Bud's together. "What am
I offered on Bud Oliver, champion of
Texas? Who will give me even money
on Turk McGlory against the field?"
The people were standing up now
and roaring, while Buster came in as
cool and undisturbed as if he had been
riding for an airing.
"That was. a good job. Buster." said
Bud Oliver heartily, and the boy in
Turk McGlory spoke out in his eyes at
this big friendliness of a rival, and he
crowded up to , Buster to shake hands,
and drew back befiore he had done it.
The betting was now all against Bud
Oliver; but that herd seemed in nowise
concerned, though he knew it would
require the greatest skill and luck to
beat such a record as Buster had made.
When Halvcrsen came up to the line
Bud Oliver observed that he was tying
his rope. Tcxaswise, to the pommel of
his saddle. The . Arlzonian ordinarily
uses a long rope, sixty feet at the
least, and throws it free, at the last
giving the"end a hitch around the sad
dle pommel, so. that he can let go in
case of accident. ..The Texan burns his
ships behind him: he uses a short rope,
ties it fast, and takes the conse
quences.
"Look how you tie that rope!" shout
ed Bud good-naturedly. . .
Halversen paid ; no heed, . and when
the- flag went down he wa3 off like a
flash. , It * was a. runty red steer, and
the" .'rope, opening from Halversen's
hand like a coil spring, settled over the
steer's : horns. There was a wild,
scrambling rush, :. Halversen's horse
turning-to one side to trip the plung
ing animal. The rope pulled taut with
"Forty-nine seconds."
animal ftself. / Turk never had. seen a
man ride so easily before. It Was a
splendid big steer, too, and it ran as
If with a feeling of the sportâ a wild
straight charge across the. corral,
swerving neither to right nor* to left.
How still the crowd was! Buster
seemed in no especial hurry. There
was .little sign of confusion or dust.
When his horse's nose was nearly over
the steer's flying tail, he swerved easily
to the left and cast his rope. The
steer seemed to set a front ,leg in the
noose as if the performance' had been
rehearsed. An instant later Buster was
tying, with Inimitable swiftness and
deftness, and then his arms were up
and his long black hair was loose in
the wind. -What a gift It is to do a
thing like a young god! And how the
crowd roared.
"Busterâ Buster Graham!"
The timekeeper could hardly make :
his voice heard.
Denny came in, hot and grimy with
dust. The grand stand was buzzing
again like a trombone heard afar off.
The poolseller bawled his bets and
Turk McGlory saw a girl In blue and
white in the grand stand. Turk was
Bhakingwith excitement; he felt that
he never could throw his rope. What
a fool he was_to compete. Vith these
old ropers! How they would laugh at
him!
A little fellow with silver spurs, and
a feather in his hat, came next, and
fumbled his rope; so that it was. past
two minutes before his steer was down.
He was hopelessly besften, and he came
in bedraggled, but grinning.
When Buster Graham .went to the
line there were shouts of encourage
ment, and acquaintances from the
stand. and the poolseller frantically ran
up his bets. Buster -rid 'Bud Oliver
were plainly the favorites, with a .lit
tle leaning toward - Bud, - as Turk ob
served with rising pride. . After, all.
there was m. man like Bud Oliver of
Texas. /.â::Â¦.
Buster Graham was a handsome fel
feilow, slim and tall, with long black
hair and the â¢ smallest - feet that ever
went-, into $20 I 'exican' boots.' On r his
horse he wasa very Centaur, swaying
and flowing with every motion like the
- "One minute, fifty-eight seconds."
"Denny is out of it," observed Bud
Oliver. â¢ "He shoukL have made it in
one throw."
â¢ The steer had turned and Denny was
after him again, riding at ; full speed
and drawing In ar-' coiling his rope' at
the same time. Round and round
swept the coil, and then it sho-t straight
forward, the loop in the air like a flat
tened O. Denny's horse went 'back on
his haunches, the steer leaped high in
air, and fell full length. Denny was
off, pulling the short tying rope from
his belt as he ran. He stooped over the
steer, tying two front and one rear
legsâ hog tying they call itâ in incred
ibly short time. Then he sprang to his
feet, arms in air. It was the signal
that the work was finished. The
judges came up and declared" the steer
properly tied. The timekeeper called
out : â¢ ."""Â¦
"Get him, get him; try him again.
Denny," roared the crowd.
An attendant was dropping one ot
the bars of the- pen twenty-five feet in
front, where a log marked the. starting
place. Denny Hughes, the first of the
contestants, was sitting his horse,
bridle rein down, coiling his rope and
fitting the rings to the proper places
between his fingers. In front of him,
a hundred feet from -the pen gate, the
flagman sat stiff and still with flag in
air. The steer was to have a hundred
feet start and the cowboy was not to
give chase until the flag dropped. As
befitted a natural sport, the rules were
few and simple. It was to get the
steer, throw him, and tie him so -that
he could not get up, and the puncher
who made the best time was the win
ner. It is the everyday task of the
cow man on the range; it is the way all
cattle are caught, either for branding
orfkilling.
Three bars we're down. A splendid
big steer stepped out with raised head
and horns high, paused a moment and
looked regally about him. In the hush,
Turk McGlory heard, with a thrill, the
coarse shout of the pool seller:
"What am I offered on Turk McGlory
of Texas against the. f eld?"
There was dead siltnce, then dust ris
ing In the hot air, and the steer . was
off. a brown streak across the field.
Down dropped the flag.' Denny Hughes
gave his horse the spur and went for
ward with a leap, his rope gyrating in
long slow sweeps about his head. Oh!
but it was beautiful to see. The steer
swerved like a bent bow to the. right
and Denny was almost on him; there
was much dust and a** occasional shout
from the. stand. I?onny leaned forward
and cast, the long rope uncoiling In
graceful curves through the air. Denny
drew in his horse sharply, the steer,
wavered: as '.the -rope struck him, then
with a shrug he threw It aside and
dashed onward. â V
him appear extraordinarily long-'walst
ed and big shouldered, high heeled
Mexican boots and a vest, unbuttoned,
but no coat. He stepped with a pecu
liar roll, seen only in these dwellers en
horses, to whom walking is an uncouth
exercise to be avoided.
Turk took two steps after her and
then went back to his saddle. She was
in blue and white; he wore a blue and
white silk handkerchief knotted loosely,
cowboy fashion, about, his throat.
Whatever else he saw he also eaw her
until she was in her place in the grand
stand.
Some one shouted, a flagman rode out
from the pen on a sleek city horse, the
admirers and the bettors slowlyworked
away, leaving the cowboys atid the
judges around the pen. The 'contest
was about to begin. Turk observed
that every contestant except Bud
Oliver and himself was an Arizona or
New Mexico man â single cinches, white
sombreros, rowel spurs, and all . that.
Turk himself wore a big black-crowned
hat, trousers sagging so low as to make
He saw nothing but deep black eyes,
and he felt the blood In his face. He
couldn't have spoken If Tie had known
that it was to save h.is life, and ht
knew that he was smiling foolishly.
She looked back over her shoulder,
raising a mischievous
"Remember," she said.
Little groups of people were drifting
by to the grar.d stand. Here and there,
from the corner of his eye, as he bent
to adjust the saddle cinches, Turk Mc
tflory caught the glint of a white
skirt or of a flowing ribbon. Some
times the girla stopped to discuss the
contestants; he heard them talking of
Bud Oliver and Mason and Buste/ Gra
ham. Suddenly, as he tightened a
latigo strap, a saucy, smiling face
looked up at him. Her sister was evi
dently trying to pull her away, but she
said, half teasingly:
â¢Tin wearing your colors, Mr. Texas.
You must win." ,
Doc Mason, who had roped with Buf
falo Bill, and a number of others whose
names were sreat in the roping field.
Turk's heart went dowh and â¢ down
when he thought of competing with
men like these, and then it suddenly
leaped up with the realization that he
was in such company, a part of it, and
he resolved that he would never leave
the field until every man in it recog
nized him as a roper, too.
"By ," he said, "I'll etay."
Here at the pen, where a dozen wild
steers were crowding and panting,
were knotted the cowboys and their
admirers. Carver and his judges, and
the small men who were betting. With
a throb of the heart Turk recognized
Bud Oliver, to him the greatest man
on the cattle range. No man between
Texas and Los Angeles was his equal
lor roping and tying. Turk McGlory
would rather have been Bud Oliver
than Governor of Texas. Turk was the
â¢ hampion, receiving his friends like a
king, giving them an offhand word or
Â«â¢ clap on the backâ a hopelessly inimit
able perfection of good-fellowship. And
then there was Euster Graham/ the
champion of Arizona, and Halvcrsen, a
â¢quare man v.tth a Jaw like a bulldog's;
a liule white mustache, the first fruits
of manhood, and good-humored, firm
lips. There was something so irresist
ibly new about him that Carver, the
head judge of the roping, instinctively
called him "the Kid."
You shall see Pasco's: Brown 'dobe
huis in the miciEt of a wide gray plain,
tufted in the foreground like upholstery
â¢with knobs of sage brush; a railroad
gleaming across :t like a chalk line;
dim blue mountains, ragged alor.g the
top, 6et up In the distance. Out from
the towu, on the right, a dusty road
led to a huge uorral used for a race
course, with a Â£te-er pen in one corner.
Cow punchers V. ere saddling, tighten
ing cinches, mounting and ridins up
and down in bustling confusion; a
crowd was gathering to the grand
stand at one side; a tail fellow in a
white sombrero was bawling for bets
on the contest; and over all glared the
hot white Arizona sunshine. Pasco's
was hard at its favorite eport. Steer
roping is the fine art of the cattle
ranges; it is also the chief business of
tbe cowboy. No other great sport is
to closely linked with the daily work
of the soil, no other work has in It
â¢o many of the elements of wild sport.
Turk McGlory, riding into the corral,
felt al! the eyes of Pasco's heavy upon
h5m. It gave him a sense of heat and
too little air. He felt somehow that
they knew, especially the women knew,
that this was to ba his first public rop
ing. He wished that they also knew
of his wild riding and tying with the
Lazy A outfit, and then he was clad
they didn't. Out on the plains he had
felt the strength of every muscle in his
lanky six feet, and he was certain of
winning; bat now he felt needlessly
large, loose, obstructive, and for one
panicky second he was riding away,
prizes to the wind. Then he clapped
his teeth shut and dismounted.

a painted pony with his blanket
tutkeU up under the brim' of Iris
saddle cant!.- and his big wheel
cpurs tinkling to every ambling step of
the pinto. ..11 the signs proclaimed
that Turk was from Texas. His saddle
was double cinch, his rope was of hemp
as thick as your thumb and only 'half
as long as the Arizona rawhide riata,
and there v. ere Colorado cenchos on bis
bridle and a silver spaue bit that cost
more than the pinto himself. He had
ridden far. for # his eyebrows were pow
dered with fine white dust, end his
flannel-clad canteen rubbed light
against his saddle flank. Turk Mc-
Glory was whistling "La Paloma," aud
calculating what he would do with the
prize â which he already regarded as
won. Turk had big innocent blue eyes
that looked straight out at yaa from
the desert wrinkles of his brown face.
And. with that she pinned a blue and
white ribbon on his vest, and he looked
off over her head and trembled.
Then he saw Bud OUver stride up
with outstretched hand, and a lump
came in hia throat.
"Good boy!" said Bud. "You've saved
the day for Texas."
And then the crowd pounced on him
and hooted and shout^U. "McGlory I
McGlory!" until he was dizzy- with it
all. It was not as he tho&ght it would
be. Two hundred dollars won! And
he. Turk McGlory!
And then a saucy, flushed face look
ing up at him.
"I knew you would do it. Mr. Texas,"
she said.
There was a clatter at the pen. and
the steer shot past him. Instantly he
saw all its points â horna. legs, tail
end they spoke to him with the mean
ing of familiarity. So must the old
knight have looked for the points of
his adversary's armor. Now that he
was off. Turk's head cleared to his
.work. The steer ran with hind feet
swinging sideways, hoglike. He re
membered a Â£t*'cr in the .Lazy A outfit
that had the same habit, and a bad
one it was. too. How strange that he
should think of such things at such
a time! The steer was swerving swift
ly to the left. The pinto, nose forward
and dilating, instantly slackened pace,
swerving in the same direction and
cutting off distance. It was much to
have a horse, pinto though he be. that
knew his business. Turk's rope began
to swing, but he was wholly uncon
scious of it. He seemed now to see
only the legless body of a steer swim
ming on a billow of dust. .The fence!
He saw it with a throb, and he was
yet too far off to throw.' And there was
the grand stand above it, and men
rising, half in terror, and a color of
women. The steer had swung almost
round. It was a low rail fence, and
between it and the grand stand lay the
racing track. Dimly McGlory heard
shouts of warning. Would the steer
plunge Into the stand? Dimly, too.
glancing back, he saw the other cow
men charging after him to the rescue.
There was a crash; the steer had gone
through the fence as if it were paste
board, and the pinto was now close
behind. There wa3 all too little room
here In tbe track. The steer would
evidently plunge full into the crowd.
Turk McGlory's arm shot forward and
the rope sped. The pinto sat sharply
back, throwing McGlory well over the
pommel. To those in the grand stand
it seemed as if the steer, all horns aud
eyes, was plucked out of their faces.
"When they looked again, McGlory was
tyingr. and the judges and the other
punchers were swarming thrpugh the
gap In the fence. Hand3 up; and the
pinto easing away on the rope! It was
all lost. McGlory felt. The fence had
been In the way. Why couldn't they
provide an open field, as in Texas?
These Arizona men couldn't conduct *
contest. The timer lifted his hand,
and the shouting stopped.
"Thirty-six seconds," he announced.
"What a fool of . a timer," thought
TTurk McGlory. "It can't be so."
"Wait till they see you run. Pinto."
Turk said between his teeth, and tho
pinto stirred nervously under him.
"Ready." called Turk McGlory.

A BATCH OF LOVE LETTERSThe race for blue and white which
has swe^t over London was given its
impetus by the pretty hat and waist
worn by the American Countess and
to-day in London there la nothing that

It was the Counte-s of Yarmouth
who, on going to the theater for the
first time in London, after her mar
riage, selected turquoise blue and
white. She wore a big hat. all chiffon
and feathers. The brim was round and
rolling: upward and it was covered with
lace. Her waist was a thin white lawn
over a blue lining. A few stitches of
blue silk were drawn through the lace
of the waist.

of fur" is the advice of .'the furriers.
It'is a year when the! furrier is will
ing to serve you in very obliging ways.
He is willing to make a change of furs
for you. He will so cut and snape your
odd bits that you can have not stole,
but two or three or four, all different,
and all made to match your winter
costume.
A woman who had a brown suit took
enough old moleskin to make a little
stole. It was to be of a little flat va
riety, not very wide, and crossing In
side of the collar can be blue, put on In
a mariner to slightly show; j Thus Â¦ the
coat; and the gown are brought into
harmony.
But where .possible the gown should
be brown,, because it matches so many
furs 'so well. Brown goes beautifully
with .sable; it Is very handsome with
seal; it is a delightful color to use with
the covert cat furs that are so fashion
able this year, and brown is the best of
all shades to combine with mink. Next
to brown comes green, then gray, then
black, then blue.
To relieve the sameness of brown
fur and brown cloth there can ba
enamel buttons and there can be or
namental cords and tassels, and these
can show white and blue cunningly
interlaced. There can be passeriien
tertes with scarlet and blue and white
all â¢ intertwined. And thare can be
lace and embroidery, though the ama
teur should not attempt to embroider
her own furs until she has taken a
few lessons In thÂ« art.
â¢ A ereat manv of the nrpHv fun ir\.
ment is not such a very unusual one.
A Handsome Calling Suit. . < 'Â¦ >
Civet cat and the other striped furs
are too conspicuous for the woman who
has only one set of furs, j But these furs
are distinctive^ and striking and tney
are certainly handsome and dressy. So
she who has something old in the way
of furs to fall' back upon can buy one
of the brllliajntly striped furs for nice
Â¦ wear. ' ''
; The 'three-quarter fur coat, tight flt
i ting, is worn a" great deal and it is seen
at -its best in Persian lamb. With it
there is worn a stole of mink and a big
, pillow muff of mink, all trimmed with
; tails, is carried.
j \ Wonderfully handsome calling effects
. are produced by taking black uncut vel
. vet or black mirolr velvet and making*
j It up into a street gown. T,he skirt
\ should be round and full, wlth'hip shir
. rings. And the sleeves should show the
. new high ehoulder puff. There should
ba smart, wide turn back cuffs.
Now, with this gown, the woman who
. wants to make a great' showing will
wear a stole of Persian lamb going
around her neck and hanging well down'
the front. She will also carry a big
Persian lamb muff of the granny shape.
The effect of a black mirolr velvet
dress with Persian lamb muff and stole
is very much as though the whole suit
were of Persian lamb, with muff and
stole to match. It Is very dressy and
suitable for nice reception and calling
wear. â¢ .
Sleeves are almost startling in their
originality. One handsome coat had
wide bell sleeves to which there was'
fastened a big silk tassel.' Another, had
wide sleeves with the back of the cuff
trimmed with long dangling silk fringe. ,
While a third coat of the three-quarter
variety had big open mandarin sleeves
with immense cuffs of white Llama
lace.
Irish crochet cuffs are no novelty
upon fur coats. They are frequently
seen and so are cuffs of antique lace,
though antique is getting a little out of
" fashion, for it is giving way to newer
forms of imported and domestic lace.
If cuffs show a great variety, collars
are positively multitudinous in style.
There are immense fur collars, cut all
With autumn comes tha matinee
girl and a creature of beauty she Is.
The first robin chirping in the spring
is not more welcome than this girl of
beauty. In her new plumage of bril
liant color,- in her handsome headgear
and her dainty accessories she is by
far the daintiest, sweetest thing of the
season.
The matinee colors are celery green
and golden brown. To these may be
added orchid pink, sweet violet, which
is a bright pretty shade, and deep red
of the color known as cranberry.
These go beautifully with ermine furs.
Â¦.The matinee girls also wears the
wine colors and the colors that make
enc think of wine. She wears claret
red, sauterne yellow, chartreuse and
absinthe 'green, burgundy and cham
pagne. The last is a very pretty yel

thing for wear with either black or

colors.

along the scalloped edges. And there
are wide sailor collars slashed up in the
back, cut In circles, with lace set in un

your fur collar and still be In the style.
The very tall collars which, as the Med
ici collars, held sway so long, are quite
out of style, few being seen. The vogue
is for the fur coat with no collar at all
or with a rolling collar, which can be
worn with a boa or stole.
To say that it is to be a fur season
is making a very mild statement.
There were never one-half as many
furs nor were they ever -made in ways
one-half as extravagant. It is simply
heartrending to behold the slaughter

lace trimmings running down the arm,
terminating in handsome cuffs. If the
waist be a dark waist â and many of
the matinee girls affect dark gowns,
then you may be sure it is something
handsome. Often she wears' a white
waist with a wide collar of ermine
around her shoulders.
One of the daintiest matinee girls
wore a suit .of tan colored Scottish
cloth, which is a mixed goods, trimmed
with chiffon broadcloth. The collar,
which was a triple collar, looking for
all the world like a cape, was bordered
with very narrow bands of Japanese
embroidery. The Eton and the sleeves
were trimmed with antique . lace. Cro
cheted dangles hung down the front of
the stole collar.
The matinee girl, while she is a
dressy creature, is never neglectful or
forgetful of the- harmonies. She selects
something, always, in the shade of red
or crimson, cardinal or. rose. The mat
inee girl regards picturesqueness as a
sacred duty and her gown will have
touches of that which 13 picture-like
whatever else it may lack.
One matinee girl wore a hat encircled
with deep red roses, heavy in color and
making one think of autumn. Around
her neck there lay a triple collar with
scalloped stoles, trimmed with knitted
balls and cords.
Another matinee girl wore a big wide
brimmed straw hat, doubtless remod
eled from the summer's finery, trim
med in autumn fashion. A big nest of
feathers was bunched on top of the hat.
The hat was in blue and brown. Tfca
fles are hand embroidered and these
are worn with handsome silk cos
tumes. The taffeta street dress is ex
quisite with an embroidered fur stole.
And the satin gown, which is so very
fashionable this season, is charming
with the little shoulderette of baby
lamb embroidered in â¢handsome Per
sian designs or with Persian embroid
ery applied to the edge.
Persian lamb and Its near relative,
the baby lamb, and all the rest of the
lamb family take embroidery very
nicely and for that reason one sees
stoles, little Jackets, muffs and collars
of all sorts and conditions trimmed
with bands of Japanese embroidery
and with strappings and buttons of
Persian and with hand work in Amer
ican designs.
Fur Is difficult for an amateur to
handle, but embroidery can generally
be appliqued by any one who can sew
at all. The method of applying is
simple. You carefully, measure* off
the space and purchase exactly
enough of the Armenian, Persian or
Oriental trimming. It is apt to be ex
pensive and one* does not not want to
waste one's money. . The trimming
comes, sometimes, in patterns, in ex
act lengths, arid you can sew it to the
collarette without cutting it : and to
the pillow muff in. the same way. This
is not. hard, to apply. : vv^/ . ..' .
. The popular cahvas embroidery is
used in the trimmings of ahoulder
e'ttes and pieces for the neck and for
the revers, and this takes quite a good
deal of taste, for one can easily spoil

And there is another color combina
tion which is popular with the matinee
girl and it is a harmony which was in
augurated by another American woman
of title. It was at a recent reception
that the Duchess of Manchester wore
a wide-brimmed hat of pale gray felt,
abundantly trimmed with small pink
and white and red flowers. They were
tiny and they were massed. The en
tire brim was buried In them and they
were heaped upon the front, while
bouquets of them were apparently
pushed off the back of the hat.
As In previous seasons,- there is a
fancy for things that dangle from the
hat. Feathers trail upon the neck and
upon the back of the stock and stream
ers of lace are seen upon many hats.
Flowers are pushed off at the sides and
bows of ribbon planted underneath
the brim. Hats are .certainly smart,
and American hats are coming to have
more prestige than Paris hats. - -
The matinee- girl Is expected to re
move her hat and this calls attention
to her neck gear, which must certainly
be pretty. The girl who neglects her
stock loses a great deal in the scheme
of dress. The collarlesa matinee waist
Is very fashionable, and. with the col
larless waist, there can be worn a band
of velvet around the throat, for the
velvet neck band has been revived.
The ribbon stock is much less fash
ionable than it U3ed to be, but its place
is ably taken by the lace stock, which
Is worn almost to the exclusion of
everything else. Made of lace of any
color. It is stiffened, cut In fancy
shapes, worked with silk stitchery and
worn with any gown.
One of the handsomest lace stocks
was made upon a wire foundation, . one
of the sort one can buy for a few cents
in the shops. This foundation was cov
ered with tiny lace appliques and then
the narrowest pipings of silk were used
to trim the stock. This made as pretty
a neck arrangement as one could want.
They are cutting stocks out of velvet
with a little yoke attached. Pieces of
lace are then set In and the top is edg
ed with lace. Handsome steel and sil

something distinctive will have no
trouble finding' a pattern which will
stilt her fancy.
waist there is a wide blue girdle, a
stock worked in blue and a big hat
trimmed with blue feathers.
Small Hints on Dress.
Taking a piece of sealskin, she cut
out a pretty vine, with big, handsome
leaves, all of sealskin. She applied
three of these brown sealskin vines to
the front of her ermine muff and half
a dozen to her , collarette. Then she
finished the ends with black and white
tails. The result was lovely and It cost
very little.
Your Collar and Muff.
You can purchase an ermine collar
and muff for any price you . want to
pay. A handsome set traveled to the
Berkshires for the late October season.
It cost $500. The ermine collar was
wide, and there were long stole ends.
The muff was big and fiat, a pillow
muff. Big sprays of fur flowers â flow
ers cut right out of black fur â were
applied to the collar and the muff and
there were tails, plenty of them. Tail
bearing animals are certainly in de
mand this year.
But these little Ideas are only the
very small beginnings of the season's
fashions. The styles in furs are really
marvelous and one can study them a
long time and learn something new
every minute.
One of the prettiest of ideas is to
trim one kind of fur with another fur,
and, in doing this, one can get beautiful
effects. If you trim chinchilla with er
mine; if you trim sealskin with baby
lamb; If you trim Persian Iamb with
mink, or if you try any of the other
artistic combinations of the season you
will get something very pretty, for it
is difficult to go astray in this matter.
But here is a .word of caution: Do
not use imitation furs. Or if you do
use them let them be frankly imita
tion. Seal plush' is lovely as plush,
but not as seal, and there are imita
tion furs that are handsome in their
own condition, but which become
hopeless when you attempt to call them
sable, or chinchilla or otter. "Wear them
as imitations, but not as the real.
Those who have scraps of fur can
utilize them in various ways, one of
the prettiest being the stole of fur.
To make a stole take odd lengths of
furâ anything you happen to have. Cut
your stole according to your fur. Let
it be long and wide if you can, with
front ends hanging down to the hem
of the dress. But if there is not
enough fur for this, why, let it be
The furrier shaped the stole, made It
up prettily and trimmed the ends with,
of ermine, upon WhlcTi he sewed
little ermine tails. One can take old
pieces of sealskin, patch them together
and make them into a very neat 6tole./
This can be trimmed with a contrast-:
lngr fur. There are very pretty ways of
making up a seal stole; with ends that
grow very wide and are crossed in
front. These ends can be trimmed with
big circles of Persian lamb, or of er
mine or chinchilla, or whatever fur one
happens to have. . t
Don't think that your fur must be
thrown away if it is old and shabby.
On the contrary, it can be made over
into something that Is pretty. There Is
no Question but that half of the lovely
little fur articles of the season are
made' from odds and ends of fur re
claimed from the ragbag and the old
clothes man. Â¦
There are collarettes and stoles made
by piecing furs together so that they
are almost striped. Such collarettes are
extremely dressy and they make a
pretty change. They can be worn, with
gowns to match, for it Is the fad to
match everything this year. - â¢
Your furs must match your gown.
This Is bad Intelligence for the woman
who has only one gown and only one
set of -furs, both widely different. Yet,
If she be a wise woman, she will not
despair, but will endeavor to make the
ways and ends meet. ; .
A woman who had a gown of blue
cloth and a coat of sealskin is said to
have solved the problem by trimming
the cloth gown with brown braid, and
trimming the fur coat with blue pas
: cement erie and blue Persian. ''
There' come great, beautiful, blue en
amel buttons, which can be used to
trim brown sealskin coats, and there
can be bands of silk used upon the col
lar and the cuffs, the re vers, the; fac
ings and in the linings. Â¦ The coat can
be lined with blue silk to match. the
gown, and the cuffs can be turned back
and faced with blue.
Big blue buttons can be sewed upon,
fur cuffs, and there can be a collar of
seal added to the coat; and the inner
the middle of the front The two ends
were' round and big, saucer-shaped
ends they are called.
Artistic Fur Trimmings.
This woman had It dressed. The fur
rier took it and washed It, for furs
wash nicely. Then he dried it, dyed it
slightly, to as to restore its color, and,
finally he cent it home looking very
much like new.
Then this woman, who is something
of a genius in dress, bought enough
white silk braid to go all the way down
each side of the front of the coat. Braid
Is hardly a good term. She selected a
whit* silk passementerie, as wide as
your band, with a few silver threads
running through it. The pattern was
a vine pattern and there were lovely
silver grapes hanging to it. She ap
plied this to the seal coat, making a
handsome garment.
Her flat muff she treated in the same
way, with a wide band of silver passe
menterie.
Then there was a girl who at the
beginning of this season found herself
with an old-fashioned ermine collarette
a?d a flat ermine muff. She took it
anÂ£ treated it in a most remarkable
manner. She copied a handsome idea
xvhich she had seen carried out upon
the collar and muff of the Countess
Another set cost a thousand. It was

was big and fiat and applied with cir

I am judged by them, classified by
them and I must rise or fall by them."
That a woman is judged by her fur
coal there Is no manner of doubt There
Is no other one garment which so
plainly proclaims its cost and Its man

knows nothing whatever about furs,

ticate our food and the greater force
needed to do so the more blood will be
called â¢ into circulation and the more
active the action of the salivary and

Follow this with another small dry
pledget of cotton, being careful not to

carbolic acid, creosote, chloroform or
anything caustic inside or outside of

They only add fuel to the fire Instead

the gum above the tooth and over the
root is swollen and seem to be what
is known as a gumboil, open it if pos

lease the pus. Poultice only from
the inside of the mouth. Take a rai
sin, roast it and cut in halves. Scoop
out the center portion of one of the
halves and fill the space with red
pepper. Apply the pepper side of the
raisin to the swollen gum a point
over . the abscessed tooth. The lips
will hold the raisin in place, and

cannot be : made. If two teeth are
involved use the other half of the

to serve as masticating organs from

Young minds are roost succeptibl*
and the teaching which a growing child
imbibes sticks fast in his memory. See
how eagerly the little one instinctively
tries to imitate you in everything, even
in the art of brushing the teeth. By
encouraging this tendency the child
will not have the popular aversion to
the tooth brush and in time will find it
mightier than the dentist. By twist
ing a wisp of cotton about the end of
a wooden toothpick one can make a
very serviceable instrument for home
use and bo inexpensive as to be used
but once. The green stains so common
to children's teeth can be removed

In the manipulation of the toothbrush
should be a vital part of the training
of tÂ»e kindergarten. By nipping all
diseases In their lncipiency we can rear
a race of Trojans, and as we made the
education of the youth compulsory, we
must be equally despotic, and making
strong, healthy children, put a sound
mind in a sound body. For the great
mass of the poor properly conducted
clinics must be supported by the state
and by philanthronically Inclined hu
manitarians which will enable the pÂ«or
to have skillful treatment. In such a
time those who prey upon them, the
dental parlor faker with the electric
sign and painless front, will fold up
his tent like an Arab and silently slink
away.
THE kcynoto of modern dentistry
Is the prevention rather than
the cure of diseased renditions
of the ir.outh and surrounding
tissues. The reformation must
begin in infancy and the battle be
ceaselessly waged from the^radle to the
grave. The parent who has never had
the advantage of a college or commer
cial education feels keenly that draw
back during his whole life and for
his children he wishes r.o such handi
cap. Such a father would almost beg
gar himself to afford a son, the apple
cf his eye and the pride of his old
ase, every advantage in life of which
he himself has been deprived. Eecause
our fathers had such magnificent teeth
end never kn?w a toothache, they are
singularly blind to the needs of the
child In this particular regard. Only
the man who has suffered- the pangs of
em aching or abscessed tooth and all
the attendant tortures of neuralgia in-
Kists upon his child being spared that
agony. The parent who has passed
through life nibbling on a few old
stumps or laboriously attempting to
Tuasticate upon ill-fitting plates wishes
his own child more comfort in life and
a more vigorous manhood.
"Whether the wretchedly poor teeth of
to-day are inherited or are the result
of the present day mode of life, with
Its dissipations and neglects, the father
and mother mu6t grapple with this
most serious problem, and the sooner
the better. Without good teeth the
whole body suffers the effects of im
proper mastication and imperfect di
gestion, which inevitably brings about
111 health, and without good health what
happiness can there be in life?. Does it
not then devolve upon the parent of to
day to guard well the teeth of the
child if they would have the sturdy,
vigorous manhood of the morrow? By
universal consent we have given to the
mother the training â¢ of - the children
and before the bar of public opinion
she must sooner cr later give an ac
count of her stewardship. Is there a
mother who would not lay down her
life gladly for her children or suffer in
tlieir stead any and all of the aches
and pain of childhood? What mother
would refuse to relieve the distress of
her child if she but knew how? The
wise mother is the one who makes a
memorandum of the things she has
found useful in her life and such a
Â«oman always knows as well what
remedy to apply in time of sickness as
the docs where the shut-off is located
when a v.ater pipe bursts in the

The mother's ear is most sensitively

not have to rack her brain to remem

doubts and mis^ivinss as to whether
she is using the right medicine or the
proper proportions. If we will but sys
tematize our lives and jot down the
helpful hints which have stood the
test of time, we will always know the
most effective remedy to allay an ach
ing tooth, how to check a hemorrhage
or banish the dread visitor of the
nigbtly watches â neuralgia. It is fool
hardy for a parent to be indifferent to
the baby tcth, and it is simply crim
inal carelessness to permit neglect after
the sixth year. If a parent is so t-hort
eighted as to ignore the infant teeth as
things of Heeling existence and of no
permanency the will, if there is a bit
of maternal instinct within her. at
least see that the permanent teeth do
rot fall into a sknilar decline. It is
just as harmful to your child's future
welfare to al'.ov/ him to associate with
the riff-raff of society and not expect
him to be contaminated morally as to
permit good strong young teeth to lio
in uninterropte'd contact with decayed
or ulcerated ones and expect them to
suffer no harm physically. The parent
should guard against the premature
loss of the baby teeth and a permanent
tooth must never be sacrificed save as
a last resort. The poor teeth of this
generation aro caused in great meas

. POINTS ON WEDDINGS (Bride).â
Invitations are usually sent out two
weeka before the date of the wedding
ceremony. The invitations should be
engraved, never printed, and this ex
pense as well aa the expense of mailing
them is borne by the parents of the
bride. Certainly, It was the proper
thing to ask your Intended husband for
a list of the names of friends whom
he would wish to attend the wedding.
If the list is too leng or if there are
objections to any of the people h*

matters and by exercising a little tact

and unpleasantness later. All wedding
gifts should be acknowleged as soon as

this Is imperative. The same rule ap

friends or relatives of your husbancl
to-be whom you have not yet met. Th*
bridegroom pays for the carriage to
and from the church and train; hÂ© also
pays the minister's fee and for the
flowers for the bride and bridesmaids.
The correct outfit for a bridegroom for
a 12 o'clock wedding is a black frock
coat, fancy or white waistcoat, dark
gray hair-striped trousers, white gloves
and white tie. The gown for the bride
is always made with high neck and
long sleeves. As the decorations are to
be in white and gold, I would suggest
that the bridesmaids' gowns be of thÂ»
same dainty color scheme. White chif

force the flesh backward with the ball

SINGEING OR CLIPPING HAIR
(Margaret).â For years there has been
miich difference of opinion as to wheth
er singeing or clipping the hair is the
better method for removing the faded
and split ends. If singeing is resorted
to it should be done by an experienced
hairdresser, for, in the hands of an un
skilled person, more harm than good
will result. Clipping, however, can be
done by any careful person with good
eyesight. The hair should be brushed
smoothly and divided Into strands.
Hold a strand firmly In the hand, and
if the ends are very much faded or
split, cut off one-half to one Inch, ac
cording to needs; then pick up the
shorter hairs and clip each end just
enough to remove the split portion.
Continue thus until all the hair has
been gone over. If neglected for some
time the hair is apt to dwindle greatly
at the ends and be quite thin and worn
for three or four inches of its length.
If this is tKe case It is a decided im
provement to cut off this portion of the
hair and thus start a more uniform
"growth. The pernicious habit of using
a hot curling iron Is responsible for
much of the shabby hair one sees. If
the Iron must be used have it as cool
as is compatible with the desired re
sult. When the hair is once got in
good condition it is not a good plan to
keep up the clipping process, for the

At specs! price cf 40c Â«=** 80cTHE present outlook for encourag
ing trade and business relations
with Mexico, Central and South
American trade offers a perspec
tive that it has never enjoyed before.
â¢ To illustrate what amount of. busi
ness is done on the west coast from the
peiÂ£ of San Francisco, let us take a
few figures, say from ten years back.
In 1834 there was sent out "by -water' to
different parts of the world, merchan
dise to the value of $26,484,000. Of this
amount -$3,840,700, or, say, 15 per cent,
Â«as distributed along the coast of Mex
ico and Central America. At that time
the Hamburg line of steamers was but
at the beginning of ita operations,
hence with the exception of the one
steamer belonging to the Pacific Coast
Steamship Company, the Pacific Mail
Steamship Company carried .the whole
freight.
The fare from San' Francisco 'is
about 3 cents a mile (a trifle over) to
Panama â that is to say, approximately
1105. From San Francisco to-.' New
Tork, by way of Panama, the "fare Is
Jl'JO, 316 more for 11.00 miles addi
tional. '
Commercial developments -are tUrn-
ulated by the accessibility afforded to
visit the different places.. No obstacle,
however, is so great as that ; which
has to be overcome by high passenger
rates. With moderate transportation
rates, the immense mineral resources
of the States ol Sonora and Slnaloa
would call for capital and mining ma
chinery to be furnished by California,
The' agricultural resources of the
States of' Jalisco, Colima, Michoacan,
Guerrero, Oaxaca and Chiapas would
furnish the markets of. San Francisco
with tropical fruits, dyes, gums, hard
wcods, coffee, cocoa, vanilla, etc.,
which are indigenous to the soil, but
are uncultivated, as cultivation never
is . undertaken unless there be some
prospect of economical transportation.
Business has increased between
Mexico- and the United States 114 per
cent. in ten years, but" the exports be
tween ' San .Francisco j and the west
coast of â¢ the .' southern . coast have re
mained at a standstill during the same
period. 1633
Mexico exports 3,000,000 pounds of
coffee to the States. Of this amount
812,000 pounds come. to San Fran-
cisco; but to connoisseurs the Colima
8nd Uruapan coffees are unrivaled.
Honduras and Costa Rica are able to
support a line of weekly steamers
from Â» New â¢ Orleans by shipping
bananas, which we areienabled to buy
on the streets for 20 cents a dozen after
paying a five days' water freight < and
a transcontinental railroad freight.
The same fruit could be shipped from
San Bias and ; Manzanlllo were Â¦ there
a steamer line that. would carry them.
Moses Taylor of New York: made his
huge capital out of the forests of Vera
Cruz and Tabasco, while those oh the
Pacific coast are barely touched. It
Â¦will be stated v that : there are not
enough bananas under cultivation on
the Pacific, coast for exportation. 1 :'â¢ It
is quite true, , but it Â¦ is Â¦ also, true that
the "Guinea" banana, so highly ' es
teemed for its . ! flavor and < shipping
qualities, does grow on this coast; but
v/ho will invest in plantations â¢without
calculating first the % possibility of
transportation , facilities? - .
With the completion of the Manzan
lllo and Guadalajara road, -which' now
lacks but a few miles; with' the v har
bor improvements and wharfage facil
ities now about completed at ; Manzan
lllo, San Francisco will ; be '* in .-direct
communication " with * the State of Ja-
hsco, of one million inhabitants, whose
wants are at present supplied by Chi
cago and New York-
Providing that the merchants of SanÂ»
Francisco are willing to furnish such
goods as the market demands, and not
insist upon the natives adopting their
own -tastes, and will follow instructions
as to packing, and send down, not the
loud-mouthed story telling, free ' and
easy - drummer, but a sober, broad
minded man,' accurate but unassertive,
a very: large increase of San Francis
co's Â¦ export business may soon be ex
pected. . . ,
An important fact to be remarked is
this: In all shipments to the south it
will | be seen that tl|e . amounts to Cen
tral American ports are-, much larger
than those that are" consigned to Mex
ico. This is explained by the fact that
all : the "shipments to and from Central
America are by way of the sea, where
as. Mexico sends eighty, times more by
land than; by, water. .
If Germany can "afford , to send cotton
prints, hardware, musical instruments,
and .so -forth,, around- by way of the
Horn, over 15,000 miles to the Pacific
ports of Mexico, will it not benefit her
t>use the 1 Panama canal to the detri
ment of this State, arid will she not
avail herself of the opportunity, which
is-so freely offered to her by prohi
bitive freight' and passenger rates?
THE importance of looking well
after the trade of San Francisco
with the Orient is emphasized by
a consideration of the conditions
in the State. California is a pro
ducer and a' large one and must of
necessity look to foreign markets for
ther distribution of many of her. prod
ucts. A few years ago this matter was
not as important . as now, because a
great portion of the export trade from
here was made up of wheat which
went to the English markets. Under
the decline In wheat growing and the
larger' production of flour than in for
mer years, new markets must be se
cured. Under the stimulus of necessity
for manufactures, manufactured prod
ucts have become more general in this
SJate and these must find markets out
side of our own State. Notwithstanding
the fact that we are already producers
to a very considerable extent in, excess
of local demand, the effort* is continu
ally put forth on all hands' to. increase
the population of the State from the
class that become producers. It there
fore must be clear to any, one who con-
elders matters at all in a thoughtful
way that it â¢ stands the merchants of
San Francisco as well as the pro
ducers to use every possible effort
to encourage and foster and en
large the trade with foreign countries.
What California can produce few even
of those who have made the most care
ful study of ; it have any conception.
It is not alone the agricultural and
horticultural products that we need.'
but it is the growth of manufactures
of various kinds, and who knows what
these may develop? With the climatic
conditions, with cheap fuel and with
abundant* labor and with every con
dition favorable to manufacturing, why
should not this State become a large
producer of the goods which Eastern
countries demand?
One of thÂ« advantages that the great
expositions of the world develop is
trade competition with different parts
of the world.. Through the exposition
which is now in progress in St. Louis.
California is being brought to the.at
tention of various countries, and in
whatever we excel, whether it.be tn
raw products or manufactured goods,
other countries will endeavor to com
pete with us. It therefore stands Cali
fornia in hand to do everything that
can be done not only to maintain its
present -. commercial position, but to
compete with the world's products la
whatever market they are consumed.
It must be clear to all thinking persons
that articles of merit, whatever they
may be, can be placed In almost any
market, and even though the people
to which her products are offered at
first use them in moderate quantities,
once the merit and prices are established
those markets will continue to grow
and are likely to develop Into large pro
portions.
San Francisco la to-day the recog
nized metropolis of the Pacific Coast,
but any lack of energy, enterprise or
determination on the part of the mer
chants of this city will be taken ad
vantage of by other cities on the coast,
and once thi3 business Is established
in these other competing cities. San
Francisco will find it difficult to ac
quire It. The principal towns at the
north and south of us are constantly
putting forward efforts for the exten
sion of trade, and there 13 no reason
to think -that any Indifference or lack
of energy on our part will not be taken
advantage of, by them. It must there
fore be. apparent to all that the ques
tion of how best to enlarge the for
eign trade from this port and to main
tain that whtch we now have Is one
which should be constantly kept In

CALIFORNIA'S TRADE. OUTLOOK
CALIFORNIA'S OPENING to the SOU^ii
By E. H. Coffey
Eastern manufacturers that all China
needed was development and that
any one who would devote a little
time to the interests of this new buyer
could build up a colossal trade in little
or no time. They knew of what they
were speaking, for they had been over
the ground carefully and systemat
ically.
Some firms, more venturesome than'
the rest, went back to first principles
â nothing ventured, nothing gained â
and sent out samples of everything
they carried in stock. But on the
other hand, some were afraid of the
proposition, and were satisfied to
dillydally In safer, tried-out fields.
That failed to ruffle the calm of the
advance agents, aivd when they sailed
again they carried with them sixty
odd trunks, and had others meet them
in China, so that by the time they
were -eady to invade India they car
ried one hundred and four pieces of
luggage and never failed to create the
impression that they were anything
short of a traveling circus.
"Business," said Rosencrantz, "is
jusf what one is a mind to make it.
It's easy to sell and it's easy td* buy,
but one must conform with the rules
of that country. For instance, the
Chinese are queer about their ship
ments. They want everything packed
in twosâ two watches, two umbrellas,
two chairs â and unless they come that
way they are not pleased, and some
times refuse to receive the goods. In
Singapore and about that district they
want goods in pairs â say, two, four, six
or ten. Now it really ought not to
make any difference to the man who
supplies these materials, so long as his
Honolulu was their first victim, and
ko well did they convince the mer
chants that they wanted precisely
what those sample trunks contained
that a week saw them bag and bag
gage on their way to China with a
contented smile and a cheerful click
of silver and gold. For nine months
they wrestled with 'the wily Chinese
as the advance agents of civilization
.and prosperity, and then came home
to open up larger deals with mer
chants, so" that they would be enabled
to supply the trade with anything
from an elephant's nursing bottle to
a dozen locomotives' for the Trans-
Siberian Railway. #
Round the United States they went,
trying to persuade the conservative
Two years ago H. J, Hosen
crantz and J. J. Keegan, . per
haps better known as '.'The Irishman
and the Jew," sailed away to capture
the East all hands down. They figured
to do it principally by means of ready
Irish wit, shrewd Jewish calculation
and jolly American companionship â a
combination difficult to beat. It is
true there were eight trunks packed
Bnugly with samples in the hold of the
ship, but there was precious little
money to jingle in their pockets, and
samples are not filling when the
stomach is empty and crying lustily
for satisfaction.
â¢ -when it comes to trading with the
Orient, she makes her bo*, takes a
back 6eat and permits even the baby
nations of the world to take the enor
mous trade which by right ehould.be
hers.
It tÂ»ems strange when one stops to
think of it that the United States fig
ures eo insignificantly in this particular
line of business. Every year of the
tvorld the Orient buys produce that
amounts to fully $2,000,000,000. but by
far the greatest portion of this sum
goes to England. Germany and France.
In fact, anywhere but where it should

American manufacturer and his acrents.
Instead of waking up and isvestizatins:
the cause of lack of commerce, he caJm
ly and serenely Â«oes on his way sell

would not be a patching to that of Ja

class running order.
Perhaps America does not realize
Â¦what a monopoly of Eastern commerce
*ould mean. Evidently she has not
figured on the millions of dollars that,
would pass from the Orient to the Oc-
IT is just about time that America
was sitting up and taking notice.
Ordinarily no one could accuse her
of being far behind the times, but
"Why Americans, imagine they can
send out twenty-seven-inch goods
when thirty-six has been explicitly or
dered Is beyond me, yet they do it right
along and expect to build up a trade
in that way. That maftrial is not only
useless to the consignee. .^ut It makes
him very skeptical as to American busi
ness ability and honasty.
"The few firms that have sent men
to the Orient have made a mistake in
trusting to the honesty of the . inter
preter. The only way to do business
with any foreigner is to do it direct.
"The Germans and the English do
not consider any order loo much trou
ble. They are in business to sell, and if
a customer wants an order shipped in
boxes that entails a few cents' more
expense they charge it up to profit and
loss and trust to luck to get a bigger
order next time. And, rest assured,
they get it, for when a firm orders a
thing and is willing to pay a good
price for it It intends having it, and if
it cannot get it one place it will go
elsewhere. ~

orders, but somehow or other he is
loth to depart front his own methods
of shipping and packing, and so loses

amount to hundreds of thousands of
dollars to him.
That the Easterners are willing and
ready to do business with us has been
recently demonstrated In a very
forcible and convincing manner.

would gain as the chief commercial na
tion of the world. Evidently not. or
she would be over there, in a flash
prying about and making it her chief
business in life to Investigate the pos
sibilities and to negotiate right then
and there to supply a certain amount
of goods â and goods, by the way, that
she never even bo much as dreamed
were used in that part of the globe.
The rivalry between foreign and home
manufacturers has always been of the
keenest, but in this particular case, one
is lying low and making hay while the
sun shines, while the other is steadily
increasing business at home and push
ing; vigorously ahead on the European
continent.
Cosmopolitan San Francisco's water
front is being enlarged and strength
ened every day and the trade that
comes to her P' â * is immense and val
uable, but it is not what one misjht
easily think it. Every Oriental vessel
that docks carries. a human careo of
foreigners all clamoring and eager to
be landed on American soil and to take
up their residence in this city, or Little
CHina, as it has been dubbed by amazed
visitors.
It is better in the long run to take time
and learn the language, for then there
is good faith on both sides and the sale
Is virtually made.
"My list of 'dos* and 'don'ts* Is very
email, v but if the business men would
give up some of their long, tiresome
conferences and pay attention to them
they would have all the business they
could handle. They are Just this:
"1. Don't send out catalogues print
ed in English. The customer can't
read them and nobody else will take
the trouble to.
â¢ "2. Don't send letters to Consuls.
More than half of them don't under
stand the knack of getting trade and
they are too busy to take time to an
swer letters and petitions.
"3. Don't trust to interpreter.
Try yourself, for you can sell almost
anything with samples and personal
solicitations.
"4. Don't fill orders at all unless you
can do it properly.
"5. Don't pack goods in anything but
tin-lined boxes. Remember the ship
ment may be damaged in transit and
that you will be hald responsible.
"6. Do make up your mind to give
people exactly what they want."
That the field for trade is immense
cannot very well be denied, for a
country that contains more than one
half the people of the earth naturally
can salesmen and even takes the trou
ble to tell them that they are eager
and willing to look at the samples.
Japan is so busy just at present
minding her own P's and Q's that.sh*
has no time to devote to buying and
selling, yet her little brown men buy
over the world's counter something
over $150,000,000 worth of produce every
year and think nothing of it. And
America does not think much of It
either or else she would bestir herself
and see If she couldn't by some hook
or crooK manage to secure men thaa
from $20,000,000 to $30,000,000 of It.
And so It goes throughout the entire
Eastern countries, for the spirit of
trading and of buying and selling Is
strong and seems to strengthen as the
years go by. When a traveling sales
man can sell to a single merchant la
Calcutta 10.000 gross of watch chains,
it either does not speak very well for
the resident agent, or else It speaks
mighty well for the persuasive powers
of the newcomer. At any rate, the old
tune that American manufacturers are
so prone to sing that England. Ger
many. France and even Japan have
resident firms always ready to gobble
up trade, should die a natural death,
for there is plenty of room and busi
ness for all, and the shrewdest buyer
and seller may rest assured of the
lion's share. >
On the other hand the Celestial has
much to offer. In the first place,

THE HUNGER OF A MAN'S SOUL
"Iâ I think Mr. Hawardea Is doing
right," she said softly, "only be
oughtâ'* She stopped, \rtth flushed
cheeks and shining eyes, for Jack Ea
warclen stood In the doorway.
Tha Englishman's comprehension
was quick enough this time to take ta
the whole situation.
"Alec I" he cried reproachfully.
turning to his friend, "you've told!**
"Jack,'* returned Bruce, spreading

"No. He has visited every Hawarden
in the city' and none has any knowl
edge of the old lady. He has found the
record of the death cf a, John Haward
en who came from England twenty
years a?o and who died shortly after
his arrival."
"That was undoubtedly the real
nephew." said the girl with the violin;
"an old person does not realize the
change there would be in a young man.
She would expect her nephew to look
as he -did when he left England, and
almost any big, blond young English*
man would correspond to the picture
she has carried in her' memory all these
years."
"What does Jack intend to dor*
asked Miss Fairlie.
"Take care of her as long as ehe lives
â It can't bÂ« so very long-, poor soul.
and she hasn't a cent. Jack says prov
idence has sent him an aunt and he
shall do his duty by her. She admitted
a day or two ago that perhaps she
might not bÂ« his real aunt, but she was
his 'negotiable h'aunt.* Of course the
poor old lady hasn't the slightest Idea
of the meaning of *nesotlable.* but un
der the circumstances â the way sha has
transferred herself to Jackâ you'll ad
mit it's funny. He's upstairs now ask

"That's where your ideas of right
differ from mine," said Alec coolly.
"I have my instructions from the 'ne
gotiable h'aunt' herself, and I Intend
to carry them out. You see." he con
tinued, : turning to the Interested little
group, "I've called frequently on ths
old lady and she has taken a great
fancy to me as ths friend of her dear
â¢Jock.' Last night she gave me this
little box and asked me to give It to
the young lady of Jack's choice, with
the request that she make use of it In
furnishing a home."
Ha took from his vest pocket a
tiny, fiat box of tin. hardly more than
an Inch square, and held It cut on tha
palm of his hand. It was sealed by
having a thin strip of .paper-pasted
over the Joining cf the box and Its
cover.
" "I suppose It never occurred to the
old lady . that a great, big. hulking

the word3, "like Jack bad not dared

He paused as if to gather courage
to go on, and his face paled.
"Dcn't. Alec!" he protested.
"Jack," said Alec, solemnly, "we are

Alec smiled and nedded, but as toon
as Jack bad disappeared he continued
seriously: "It's a thing you ought to

love, because the young lady is earn

far from satisfactory. But the first of
the year he was promoted, with a gen

his courage (here Alec paused and
cade a strenuous imitation of a person
using a screwdriver) when he received
a message from the immigration au
thorities that changed all his plans."
The wily story-teller stopped as If the
narration .was complete.
"Do go on,'* cried some one Impa
tiently; "that surely is not the end?"
"What could the immigration author
ities want of Mr. Hawarden?" ex
dalced another.
After much urging Alec continued:
"When Jack went to the Immigration
office he found a clean, decent-look
ing old English woman, who fell upon
bis neck and called him her dear
nephew, and announced to the officers
that he was the living image of her
dear dead brother 'Jock.* Now Jack
hasn't & living relative and never had
an aunt, and he tried to explain this
to /the old lady and to the officers.

"Fia sorry, you know." ba . said
slowly, "that Alec ha3 told the story,
but there is only one truthful way for
me to finish it."
He took the box from Brcce's hand
and passed it to Miss Stuart, saying
only. "Will you open the box?"
Her beautiful eyes filled with tears,

to break the seal- -Peace* Gray banded

"He was very nice." she continued.
"We went back to sit on the stairs to-

The redheaded kind always has."
Randy utterly ignored Jim Ben at
the supper table, although he went so
far a* -to ask. "What's them?" when
she passed him the plate of biscuit that
gave outward evidence of the inward
presence cf a superabundance cf soda.
After .supper he further violated all
precedent by jrettin-r the kindlings "far

When he had performed this work of
supererogation, he sat down just In
side the kitchen door and watched
â¢while she washed and vriped the dishes.
She handled them daftly and swiftly
anl moved about with light foot. Her
sleeves were rolled to her shoulders.
Jim Ben would have been less than
human if he had net best-.-wed sly; ad
miring glances en her white and shape
ly arms. She turned en him suddenly
and cau.f ht him fairly.
""What you ga-wkin' at me for?'* "
"I wasn't frawkin'! I was just won

"What? My arms?**
"No, ma'am. Them freckles."
For answer she clouted him about
the ears Â£*tth the wet dishcloth, but
when he had Insloriously tied from her
province she gave utterance to a series
of delighted â¢jiss'.es.
Jim Een kept clear of the hired girl's

Jim Ben had lifted a barrel cf salt

When he had set the barrel .on the

Jim Pen followed. He asked the

rlUed for him a quart tin cup. When
he had drunk it all he wiped his moutii

under his own personal supervision.
The position of Hever Castle lends
itself well to such an undertaking as
its owner has in mind, for it is situat
ed on the banks of the river Eden in
the Weald of Kent and close to the
classic ground, near Penshurst, made
famous by the immortal Sidney. It
is quadrangular in form, surmounted
by towers and battlements, and inclos
ing a large courtyard. Few places in
England are. richer in historic asso
ciations, both tragic and picturesque.
Heretofore Astor has manifested a
spirit of selfishness in reserving his es
tates for his own exclusive enjoy
ment, which is not at all in keeping
with the customs and traditions of the
English aristocracy, most of whom
freely throw open their domains to the
public on at least one day in the
week. When Astor bought from the
Duke of Westminster the beautiful
Clieveden property, overlooking the
Thames, he treated visitors as tres
passers and withdrew â¢ the privileges
which they had previously enjoyed.
At the present time he has a row on
Astor wants to be popular. It is no
secret that he would very much like
to get a title conferred upon him. But
it is also no secret that King Edward

to share with the crowd the good
things that his money commands. The
public is anxiously waiting to learn if

British Peers Who Are Eligible as Husbands.
Well worth cultivating by American
match-making mammas is the Duke of
St. Aibans, hereditary grand falconer
of England, who, though thirty-four
years of age, has thus far succeeded
in eluding the net of the fowler. He
is not a drawing-room Duke and pre
fers a yacht to all the gayeties of town.
He is a handsome fellow with one of
the' finest seats in England at Best
wood , in Nottinghamshire and one of
the finest in Ireland, somewhere in
Tipperary, but he has never shown any
disposition to settle down since he en
tered upon his inheritance in 1898, much
to the regret of several English mat
rons with marriageable daughters. His
property covers some 9000 acres. At
present his half-brother, Lord Osborne
He has no objection to an untitled
bride, for he has been twice married,
and each time to a plain "Miss." His
first wife was Miss Amy Ricardo, and
his second, who has been dead seven
*teen years, was Miss Isabel Craven.
With neither did he receive a fortune,
but he was only the heir when he mar
ried them. Now that he is four times
a Duke he finds himself sorely in need
of ducats to maintain his estates in
proper style, for much of his property
Is in Scotland, where rents are low.
That is why an American heiress would
stand a . good chance now of making
her money count. The Duke already
has an heirâ the Earl of Marchâ by his
first wife, and this heir has a son, so
that his third Duchess would stand a
very remote chance of "seeing any of
her offspring In possession of the titles.
RARE DUCAL PRIZES. â¢
Dukes rank first in the British peer
age after the Princes of royal blood
and the two Archbishops. Matrimo
nially viewed, among the most eligible
of them is the Duke of Richmond, who
is four times a Duke â of Richmond,
Lennox and Gordon, in Great Britain,
and Due d'Aubigny in France. He has
also three Earldomsâ March, Darnley
and Kinraraâ and the Baronial append
ages of Settrington and Methuen. He
owns nearly 300,000 acres of land, which
Is about fifteen times as much as the
Duke of Marl borough has. He pos
sesses a fine old Scotch castle, Gordon
Castle in Banffshire, ' a magnificent
mansion at Chichester, Goodwood
House, which deservedly ranks among
the best of the stately homes of Eng
land, and several other residences. He
succeeded to his estate only last year.
He is 59, tall, thin and of active habits.
He carries his age well, and where
titled marriages are concerned youth
and romance are secondary considera
tions. He is a brainy man, too, and a
plucky one; was a member of Parlia
ment for nineteen years, and as colonel
of the Third Royal Sussex Regiment
he distinguished himself in the South
African war.
-i^ONDONr Oct." 15.-â Though "the Brit
ish peerage has of . ljite years yielded
many titled husbands . to American
heiresses there is no danger of the sup
ply, running short. With over 500 fam
ilies entitled, to representation in the
House of Lords, it will be understood
that John Bull's output of peers, mak
ing no allowance for new creations, is
in a fair way to keep pace for some
time to come with Uncle Sam's sur
plus of vastly rich and pretty girls.
As a matter of fact, there are at pres
ent far finer matrimonial plums to be
plucked from the tree of the British
aristocracy than' have yet been gath
ered by the American feminine in
vaders.
By long odds the richest bachelor
peer in the United Kingdom is the Mar
quis of Bute, who is only 24 years old.
At a low estimate his property is worth
at least $30,000,000. Cupid will count for
more than cash in determining his mat-
The generous money grant made by
n. grateful nation to the national idol
terminated with the third Duke, and
the estate, which consists of some 19,000
acres, does not yield enough in the
shape of rents to maintain a ducal
style of living. This state of affairs
should make Lord Douro an easy match
for some rich American heiress. With
enough of the needful to pay the bills
an American Duchess of Wellington
would stand socially, at least, on an
equal footing with the American
Duchess of Marlborough. As far as
titles go the Wellington dukedom is
much richer in them than the Marl
bcrough one. Spain and Pdrtugal vied
with England in lavishing them on the
Iron Duke, but did not sully their man
ifestations of gratitude by. associating
them with anything so sordid and vul
gar as cash.
There is no house in London better

House, with its magnificent hall, rare
art treasures and priceless relics of the

money and those arts in Which the
American* girl excels to make It the
most popular resort of the social elect.
Lord Douro is reputed to be a very de
cent fellow. In the Guards he made the
mistake of taking his profession seri
ously instead of "going the pace," and
was "ragged" by his brother officers.
RICHEST BACHELOR PEER.
It is as a prospective Duke that Lord
Douro should figure in the list of ducal
eligibles, for if he lives long enough
he will some day be Duke of Welling
ton. He is now twenty-seven and his
father, the present Duke, is fifty- five,
but longevity as well as genius has
thus far been restricted to the first
Duke. Financially the house of Wel
lington has fallen on evil days and the
Duke has a hard time of it to make
both ends meet.
&e~Xere, is the heir-presumptive. In
cidentally the Duke of St. Albans is a
descendant of Charles II and Nell
Gwynn.
As he celebrated his seventeenth
birthday only a few months ago-, a few
years must elapse before the Duke of
Leinster can be regarded as in the
eligible list, but he is well worth wait
ing for. He is the premier Duke, Mar
quis and Earl of Ireland all in one and,
unlike many scions of the nobility,
when he enters into his hereditary pos
sessions he will have plenty of money
to maintain them. He was only six
years old when his father died and his
trustees have been carefully nursing
the property ever since, so that when
he comes of age there will be a big for
tune awaiting him. Â¦ His Kildare es
tate was recently sold for close on 57,
000.000 and he still retains a few thou
sand acres of the ancestral domain
elsewhere. Should an. American girl
marry him there 'would -be no ground
for the usual cynical jests about swap
ping British titles ' for American dol
lars. As he is one of the â¢ few. peers
who will be able to afford the luxury
of a love match, an American girl
without much money would stand
about as good a chance of landing him
as one with lots of it. And such a
marriage would establish a new record
in international alliances.
THE FUTURE WELLINGTON*.
Equally prominent socially and from
a monetary view much' more desirable
is Lord Howard de Walden, the eighth
Baron to inherit the historic title which
dates back to 1597. He is only twenty
four and enormously rich as wealth fs
estimated in the British aristocracy.
In the South African war he served
with distinction for two years, but in
these piping times of peace he devotes
himself to sports.
Lord Gerard, whose father died two
years ago. will come of age this
autumn. The family Is not a notably
rich one. but socially it Is well at the
top and the wife of the young man
would experience no difficulty In gain
ing entrance to the charmed circle of
royalty.
Among the eldest sons of peers who
will some day inherit distinguished
titles, historic seats and large estates
there is a goodly number deserving of
the attention of socially ambitious
American mothers with pretty daugh
ters, for whose benefit their fathers
are willing to shell out handsomely.
Conspicuous among them is Lord Dal
meny, the Rosebery heir, whose com
ing of age was the occasion of so much
rejoicing and sumptuous hospitality a
couple cf years ago. He is a tall, ath
letic, manly young fellow and popular
everywhere. Thus far he has shotoro a
greater predilection for sports than pol
itics, and is a first-class cricketer.
The Earl of Caledon is still a minor,
but in two years he will take posses
sion of the 30,000 acres which constitute
his ancestral domains. Castle Caledon
and Derg Lodge, Tyrone, are the hfs
tcric seats which go with the title. la
the fire at Eton College last year,
which caused such a flutter in aristo
cratic circles, the lad distinguished
himself by his pluck and coolness. His
mother cuts a considerable figure in
London society and occupies a hand
some house in Carlton Terrace. It ta
understood that she would not ba
averse to an American heiress as a
daughter-in-law, for Irisn estates are
not usually productive of large In
ccmes, and the family is not a very
rich one.
Lord Lecon field is regarded as a
great catch among British matrons, but
the fact that he is still single though
thirty-two would indicate that he does
not look with much favor on English
beauties with limited purses. He waa
one of the most important hosts of the
Goodwood races.
Although a married man the Marquis
of Downshire figures among the elig
ible peers, for a few years ago he di
vorced his wife whom he had married
when he was 22. He is now 33. He
owns about 120,000 acres; -a castle in
County Down, Ireland, and a fine old
park and residence in Berkshire.
A IIEUO WITH PROSPECTS. -
rlmonial choice, but that is no reason
why it should not fall on one of Colum
bia's fair daughters. He is three times
an Earl and several sorts of lesser no
bilities, and withal he is an eminently
proper and correct young man.
Although the greater portion of bis
hundred thousand odd acres is In Scot
land most of his wealth Is derived from
Cardiff, which he practically owns. He
cares little for society and he and his
mother usually reside in one or the
other of his northern strongholds, sur
rounded by the superbly barbaric state
of the old fashioned Scotch nobility.
Instead of evening dress he dons the
kilt at dinner and insists on all his
servants arraying themselves in High
land costume. v
dering what had happened to detain
him.
Fashionable hostesses are utterly at a
loss to provide any remedy for the state
of affairs these incidents reveal. They
cannot restrict their invitations to a
reasonable number without giving mor
tal offense to many persons and placing
In jeopardy their own popularity. How
ever magnificent their .abodes, they
boast only one front door, and only one
carriage can draw up at one time. One
or two minutes are expended while the
occupants alight, and the carriage rolls
away. When there are hundreds of
carriages filled with guests waiting,
these minutes stretch into long and
tedious hours. And it is not alone those
who are invited to these grand func
tions who are exposed to sore inconve
nience in consequence of the street
blockades they cause. Cabs containing
people who are returning to their homes
and are very anxious to get to them
are often detained for over an hour In
consequence. Swells cannot be treated
like *?ostermongers and summoned for
impeding street traffic and creating
what the law terms a nuisance.
Still more comical and exasperating
Tvas the experience of Lord London
derry. His wife was giving a big party
at Londonderry House. He had an
other engagement that evening, but
hurried hack from it to join his wife
and play the part of host. He found
the street eo blocked with carriages
On the same night Lady Currie,
whose husband was Embassador to
Rome, but whose bad health does not
permit him to so to parties, attempted
to accept the Machioness' invitation.
Her experience was somewhat similar.
She stepped from her carriage at her
hoftess' door to observe immediately
afterward that folks were leaving the
party, and looking wistfully after her
departing carriage was by' no means
cheered to hear the liftman say, "I
don't know when you'll get your car
riage again." Then, in spite of the rain,
she set an example, which many satin-
Klippered dames followedâ she ran
through the storm-swept, muddy street
until she caught up with her carriage.
EVEX THE HOST BLOCKED.
While the London season is in full
swing the crushes at fashionable func
tions are so great that many of those
who aro invited find it impossible to
gt>t inside the doors. Even more in
teresting than the stories told of grand
parties att^nipd are some of the ex
periences of those who have tried to
atter " them and failed. Determined
to be at the Marchioness of Lans
downe's big reception recently, Lord
John Hay, the brother of the Mar
quis of Tweeddale (pronounced in
Scotland Tweddle. where folks de
clare nobody but a Cockney would
pronounce it otherwise), came to
London, took rooms in town and then
brought his wife and daughters here.
Fittingly arraved, they all started out
in good time on the eventful night,
which proved to be a rainy one. but
for one whole hour and a half was
their carriage blocked in a never
ending line of smart vehicles, and the
family ultimately reached the door
of Lansdowne House just in time to
peep inside, get back to their car
riage and return home again.
THE IMPOSSIBLE CRUSH.
The Marchioness of Dufferin is go
ins one better. She is encouraging
th*Â» same class of work, but she is
finding a market for it among store
keepers both in England and America,
where she is able to obtain market
value and is, therefore, in a position
to pay the peasants a better price for
their work. Musical evenings and
Sunday outings for women and young
girls are also a r>art of her pro
gramme to relieve the monotony of
these poor people's lives. She does
not believe in indiscriminate char
ity. While she has no desire to make
money out of this scheme of hers,
she insists that it must pay its own
way if it Is to continue. If she gets
back the value of the materials which
ehe eupplies she is satisfied that her
effort will be productive of some
good.
does not mean much effort, and al
though they are wllttng~to work, there
is little they can do from which they
can reap any pecuniary benefits. Lady
Barrymore some months ago con
ceived the idea of encouraging cot
tage industry by providing materials
for Etocking making and needlework
of every description, afterward finding
an outlet for the work produced
through the medium of a number of
charities in which she and many
other friends were interested.

By all accounts (some dated long years

school. It is one of the original Daly

H. Powers, who "created" for America
the role in which he will appear. Oth

vincing as the queen, there was a pret

Stevens has many faults, tricks and
mannerisms galore. He gasps, uses his
head to clinch his points, overplays
wi^h his hands and generally some
what discounts the audience's intelli

his lines he knew and mostly delivered
well. Of no great depth, his dramatic
instinct is, on the whole, true â it fails
him in the play scene where he crawls
Â» on this stomach half across the stage to
the throne. This may be Edwin Booth
business, of which Mr. Stevens has use
fully remembered much, but it is dis
pleasing.
In the scenes with the queen and at
the grave of Ophelia Mr. Stevens was
notably natural and sympathetic. His
fencing scene was also a dashing bit of
work. I found him less convincing in
his moments with the ghost than at
any other time. But shorn of its tricks

NOTES AND GOSSIP
CONCERNING WEIiL
KNOWN ACTOR FOLK
One open air performance within
recent years we have had of "As Tou
Like It." * Nance O'Neill gave it at
Sutro Heights. It was many times
memorable. Charming, of course, in
parts, the production as a whole was
hardly convincing. One remembers,
for example, the incongruous police
man butting into the forest of Arden;
Corbett's rubbers â J. J. graced the
festival as Charles the Wrestler (in
tremendously pink tights with shrill
green trimmings) â toweled and
sponge laden, elbowing Touchstone
and Celia; and much other painful
anachronism. Ben Greet's "As You
Like It" will not be of that kind. Ad
mirably as he always preserves the
archaic quality in h,is productions,
his open air plays by repute are even
more admirably correct. He has given
even hundreds of these performances
in England.
Mr. Greet will appear as Touch
stone, and Mr. Greet is always inter
esting and distinguished, though he
may not wholly convince except in his
rarest of Malvolios. Miss Constance
Crawley will be the Rosalind and
should be as always charming. Mr.
Crawley, who, it is gradually dawn-
"As Tou Like It," in one of the
open air performances for which Ben
Greet has been famous for twenty
years in London, will be the chief
dramatic attraction of the week. The
play will be performed at Mills Col
lege next Saturday afternoon for the
benefit of the endowment fund of the
institution. In the evening a perform
ance of "The Merchant of Venice" In
its entirety will be given at Lisser
Hall. All railway and other accom
modations have been specially ordered
for the best comfort of visitors and
the whole occasion will be a notable
fiesta.

with Mr. Stevens. I went to see, just a
week after the university edition of the
play. There wasn't a textbook as far
as eye could reach and there was the
matinee girl and boy, for a large part
of the audience. It is to be owned it
was refreshing. They were there for
the play. Laughs, tears and sighs
greeted the .story. They were palpably
neither "too old nor too clever to enjoy
the action of the piece." and they were
entirely refreshing. The performance
was distinctly creditable. It did not
purport to be Shakespeare a la Bur
base, but plain, every-day, commer

ghost and more or- less convincing

I had the happiness to see at another
"Hamlet" performance the week fol

Hamlet that I had long: heard of. I
used to be an Oaklander myself, and it
was a cold week when one heard noth
ing of the "pride of the Dewey," Lan
ders Stevens. Particularly of his Ham
let one heard, and last week but one in
a. voting- contest at the Liberty play
house "Hamlet," with Mr. Stevens, was
chosen by overwhelming majority. The
same voting contests are a most inter
esting feature of the Liberty's manage
ment, by the way. Once a month for a
week the audiences are allowed to vote
upon a play to be produced, choice of
six or seven of the standard plays be
ing given. Here is the list from which
"Hamlet" was selected:
" 'Hamlet,' a tragedy of love and
madness: 'Macbeth.' a tragedy of wo
man's ambition: 'Othello.' a tragedy of
love and jealousy; 'King Lear,' a trag
edy of filial ingratitude; 'Richard III,'
the tyrant, murderer, lover, king; 'Jul
ius Caesar,' a tragedy of man's ambi
tion; 'Romeo and Juliet,' a tragedy of
love." *
It is. by the way, a subtle criticism
of the performance that there were
those able to give their eyes to the
book during its progress'.

verted on his playing: "But you did not
hear me. You went to sleep."
"That was my criticism," said Lizst.
read. Phrases were not paraphrased
merely, but parodied. Pauses waited
too often upon the prompter, not upon
sense. Emphasis fell where it would, not
where it should. Rhythm was tost,
thought obscured. And all this, be it
noted, occurred amid stretches of ex
quisite reading, at times inspired and
all but always distinctive. Most pal
pably and unpardonably it was the re
sult of hasty- and uncareful rehearsal,
and in the circumstances almost im
pertinent.
An* 'twere "Hamlet" "as when Bur
bage played" it with sweet Will as
the ghost. Mr. Greet has here too
faithfully played the imitator, like the
wise Oriental who put patches on the
new trousers because the old ones given
to him for pattern were patched. But
nay. Curtains they has not in Bur
bage's day, nor any of the gorgeous
obscuring trappings, but if I know my
poets, they had the word, the radiant
word, just upsprung from its glorious
soil. Otherwise one can well imagine
cracked crowns in their strenuous stage
direction.
And now here is what Mr. Lewis
thinks of us. He may be right. It is a
point of view and extremely Interest

that gathered in the Greek Theater for
Ben Greefs 'Hamlet" go to cee? What
were the righteous limits of our expec
tancy, and in how far did the perform
ance of Mr. Greet and his players sat
isfy them?
I have before quoted Professor Armes
on the subject, but here again is his
opinion of what we were to expect
from the Greet version of the play:
"Opposite 'Hamlet' in the repertoire
that Mr. Greet gave his advance agent
he wrote 'Universities only.' The rea
son, I suppose, was his appreciation of
the fact that only in a university com
munity could he find many who would
be interested in a serious attempt to
give the play as it was prepared for
the Etage by Shakespeare himself, and
In some such manner as it was acted
at Oxford and Cambridge during his
life time."
The programme also preluded: "The
present performance should not be
Judged as an ordinary theatrical per
formance. No rew readings will be at
tempted, the whole endeavor being to
five the play, with the scenes usually
emitted, in a primitive manner, as
rearly as possible like that in which it
tras produced just three hundred years
ago."

A Recent Painting by H. W. Hansen Which Has Attracted Much Attention |
PARIS, Oct. 15. â The prosecution
of the Marquis Casa Riera, alleged to
be the former butler of the old Mar

for the real heir. Is exciting a sensa

The old Marquis died in IS 81. aged
91 years, leaving a fortune estimated
at $100,000,000. There were three ,
nephews, two of whom died shortly
after their uncle. The third supposed
nephew is the present Marquis.
During the suit a death certificate
was produced from his native place In
Spain showing that the third nephew
died in 1876, five years before his
uncle. Consequently it Is argued that

"How white are the fair robes of
charity, as she walketh amid the lowly
habitations of the poor!"
The Wattereons refuse to admit evi
dence of charity in the hearts or heads
of smart set women. "Every once in a
while," as Fra Elbertus measures time,
the country is treated to a tirade on
her scant charities, or her lack of them
â which is especially pleasing to the
social anarchist. At the recent charity
festival given at Harbor Hill by Mrs.
Clarence Mackay, when she turned hsr
mansion over to the bucolic country
side, it was cried out from the house
tops that it was not charity that
prompted the proffer of the house, but
the supreme pride of its mistress. And
thus do such attacks go abroad, but
with apparently little harm. The char
ities go on in their own silent way.
To be sure, the West is proverbially
open-handed and big-hearted, but It is
eaid on the authority of statistics that
San Francisco ranks all other cities of
its size in the United States in its phil
anthropies. Now, that's nice of San
Francisco, isn't it? And distinctly nice
and worthy of the smart set maids and
matrons who are lying awake o" nights,
trying to plan out another year for
their pet charities. There's that year
old Maternity Hospital down on Eighth
street, where such humane work has
been done since its inception. It was
for that charity that a few hundred
women foregathered in Century Hall on
Thursday afternoon and played euchre
at a dollar per play. Now that was a
pleasant way of helping in a good
cause.
Then, there's the San Francisco
Branch of the Needlework Guild,
guided by the soft hands of women of
leisure, who succeeded last year in
gathering together 80,000 new garments,
to be distributed among the poor at
Thanksgiving time. New garments,
friendsâ none of your crumpled chif
fons or antediluvian matinee and ball
gowns, but fresh, new. comfortable
clothing:. That's philanthropy in its
kindliest guis-e. And they are ninv pre
paring to repeat last year's beneficence.
Then there was the concert given on
Friday night at the St. Francis by
Mad&me Francisca. engineered by a
coterie of busy patronesses, every one
of whom worked with a willâ for it was
to replenish the feeble treasuries of the
Maternity Hospital and- the Foundling
Home tlfat the fair songstress sang.

The target practice season has been
extended to December 31. Such prac
tice will be taken up by those organiza
tions that have approved ranges. While
those organizations that can will im
mediately proceed to . carry out the
provisions of the orders relative to tar
get practice, those that are unable to
complete the entire course as pre
scribed on account of lack of proper
range facilities will complete such por
tion as may be possible. Those or
ganizations that are unable to secure
any ranges whatever are to report that
fact to the adjutant general. In view
of this, many of the organizations will
not make a record for 1904. A peculiar
feature, say those' who are, up on tar
get practice, is that the order makes
no mention of section C of the firing
regulations under which the guard
shoots, but mentions two other sec
tions for guidance under which the
guard does not shoot.
Charles Evander Hill has been com
missioned captain of Company B, Sixth
Infantry, vice Newell, term expired,
The attention of all officers is also
called to the rules and regulations rela
tive to applications for and ordering of
elections in view of the fact that there
have been many instances In the past
in which an election has been ordered
after the term of an officer had ex
pired. "This," says the adjutant gen
eral, "must be continued and an elec
tions must be ordered as provided for
by law."
Many of the officers of the guard not
having provided themselves with prop
er uniforms as required by general or
ders issued in 1903, commanding offi
cers have been notified that they will
be held responsible for the non-com
pliance by officers under them to pro
cure the uniforms prescribed. !
Â¦All the officers of the guard who fail
ed to participate In the maneuvers at
Atascadero have been notified that they
must furnish an excuse through the
proper channels to the superior office
for their absence.
TARGET PRACTICE.
The attention of all examining boards
of the National Guard and of the Naval
Militia is called to the necessity of
closer scrutiny of officers elected or ap
pointed and whose qualifications should
be determined before they are recom
mended for a commission.
Careful inquiry will be made as to the
private life and occupation of each
candidate appearing for examination
In order to ascertain if his position in
private life will warrant his acceptance
of a commission in the National Guard
or Naval Militia and the proper per
formance of the duties incident thereto.
Particular inquiry must be made as to
the occupation in which the candidate
is engaged, which must be correctly
stated in the report of the board. It is
a common occurrence for an officer
after accepting a commission to offer
as an excuse for an utter failure prop
erly to perform the duties devolving
upon him the nature or demands of his
business. In the case of a busy man ac
cepting a commission something of a
hardship and self-sacrifice 1b neces
sarily entailed in the right perform
ance of his duties, and unless he feels
that he can give the time and atten
tion that those duties demand he should
not accept the commission. The opin
ion of the board as to the physical,
moral and professional qualifications of
candidates must also be stated. More
attention must also be given to the
qualifications of candidates in seden
tary duties, it being apparent that
many officers are woefully lacking in
their knowledge of this very important
part of an officer's education. Atten
tion is further directed to the Import
ance of making examinations more
thorough and rigid. In some instances
it would seem as if the meetings of ex
amining boards had been merely for
mal and the conducting of the'exam
ination perfunctory. Whenever for any
cause the board finds a candidate dis
qualified for a commission a full state
ment of the case must be made. A full
compliance with the above directions
will be insisted on.
DEL.AYS ELECTIONS.
Adjutant General J. B. Lauck in or
ders expresses the thanks of the com
mander in chief to every officer and
enlisted man of the National Guard of
California who participated in the joint
maneuvers at Camp Atascadero for
their zealous efforts in making the en
campment an unqualified success from
every point of view. The adjutant gen
eral says: 'The general interest and
efficiency shown, together with the dis
cipline and conduct of the men, merit
the highest praise. The work was well
accomplished and of infinite value to
the State troops, and they are to be
congratulated for the excellent show
ing made by them at the encampment."
Colonel Thomas Wilhelm, inspector
general of ritJe practice on the staff of
the commander in chief, has been de
tailed as a member of the board to
formulate proposed amendments to the
present military laws of the State, vice
Bangham, deceased.
The adjutant general is not sparing
in his language on the subject of what
he deems errors in the guard: "Atten
tion is called to the frequency and
persistence with which the subject
matter of orders is overlooked or ig
nored by those concerned, thereby
causing this office needless labor and
often thwarting the efforts of superior
headquarters to introduce measures of
benefit to the guard. All orders musf
be carefully read immediately upon re
ceipt, and the provisions contained
therein must be complied with at the
earliest possible moment. If an officer
has not the time or inclination to read
and comply with orders or directions
from superior authority, he is not a
good officer and is not doing his duty,
and it is not to the best interests of the
State to have such officer in the Na
tional Guard."
SCRUTINIZE OFFICERS.
The contempt proceedings against
Broker T. A. Rigdon were again taken
up and Judge Murasky made another
important ruling, holding that rule six
adopted by the Superior Court Judges
Lt null and void because it conflicts
with the statutes. The rule provides
that an order to show cause may be
deemed a notice of motion and au
thorizes contrary affidavits in con
tempt cases. In upholding the statute
as against the rule the court refused
to admit affidavits of Anna Sides
and David Wasserman of Chicago,
tonding to exculpate Rigdon. Mr.
Shortridge, however, got them before
the court by attaching them to Rig
don's answer as an amendment. A
continuance of the case until Novem
ber 15 was then granted to permit the
taking of the depositions of the Chi
cago witnesses. Objections to the con
tinuance were made by Foshay Walk
er, representing the Southern Pacific,
who also took an exception to the
partial dissolution of the injunction.
The roada Joining the Southern Pa
cific in the action against the brokers
were the Oregon Railroad and Naviga
tion Company, the Oregon Short Line,
the Union Pacific, the Chicago, Bur
lington anfl Quincy, the Chicago, Rock
Island and Pacific and the Northern
Pacific. On August 18 they secured an
injunction prohibiting the brokers
from dealing in the Knights Templar
and Odd Fellows excursion tickets.
Samuel Shortridge, attorney for the
brokers, yesterday moved that the in
junction be dissolved, his principal
ground being the failure of the com
panies to comply with the act of
March 8, 1901. Judge Murasky grant
ed the motion as to the two roads but
not as to the others for the reason
stated, holding that while the por
tion of the act imposing a $500 fine
for Its violation was unconstitutional,
enough remained to make an opera
tive law. The result will be that the
scalpers will sell portions of tickets
over the Burlington and Rock-Isl
and lines until they can bring the
other roads under the ruling or un
til the roads file -their articles of in
corporation, which will mean the pay
ment of many thousands of dollars
into the S^kte Treasury. Mr. Short
ridge contended that another law had
been violated in that none of the roads
had filed their articles with the Coun
ty Clerk, but the Judge did not take
cognizance of it.
The Southern Pacific and the other
connecting lines named as co-plalntiffs
in the suit against Ottinger and "others
might have been involved In the rul
ing had the Judge not held that evi
dence had not been produced show
ing their failure to comply with the
law. The evidence against the two
roads named was in the form of an
affidavit of J. Hoesch of the Secretary
of State's office, who stated that their
articles were not on file.
By a ruling 1 of Judge Musrasky yes
terday njornlng in the ticket brokers'
case, two big railroad corporations are
debarred from maintaining legal or
equity actions in the courts of Califor
nia until they comply with the law
requiring them to file copies o'f their
articles of incorporation with the Sec
retary of State. The Burlington and
Rock Island systems are affected by
the decision and ticket scalpers will be
permitted to deal in tickets over their
lines.

THE immigration authorities have refused a landing to a French
jurist from Tahiti who desired to cross this country en route
to his home in France. The reason given is that he has con
sumption. He was ordered deported to Tahiti. If that is the law it
cannot be too soon nor too radically changed. Perhaps some of the
very officers who give it such a harsh interpretation themselves have
consumption.
It is farcical to hold that such a cruel precaution is necessary
to prevent the introduction of the disease, for all of our overland
roads carry at this season hundreds of consumptives in search of a
mild climate. This is interstate travel, and it is as much under Federal
control as immigration is. It is permitted, but a man is sent back
to the South Pacific and forbidden transit across the country be
cause he has the same disease.
He was not an immigrant in the legal sense at all. He was a
traveler. To say that such precautions as were taken in his case
make any one here safer from tubercular infection is nonsense. Had
he been an immigrant, intending to remain in the country, no one
questions the right to exclude him. But he is a foreigner, holding a
dignified position in his Government, and asked only the privilege
of crossing our country to his home in France.
We are of opinion that if a citizen of the United States under
similar circumstances were denied the right to cross French terri
tory on his way home our Government would make a row about it.

ANSWERS TO QUERIES.
Charles E. Adams, a wealthy dairy
man near Port Chester. X. T., is the
father of three daughters, all of whom
have eloped. The last one, Sadie, 17
years old, very pretty and fresh from a
boarding-school, decamped the other
night with Walter Washburn, the over
seer of her father's farm. Adams sus
pected that his daughter loved Wash
burn, so he discharged him. Washburn
left the same evening, and the express
wagon that 'came to take his trunk
away from the Adams homestead took
Sadie's trunk, too. Adams was away
from home. When he found that his
third daughter had gone he said he
would never have anything more to do
with her. He has never forgiven any of
his daughters for eloping, and they are
all living away from home.
THREE DAUGHTERS ELOPE
WHEN Kuropatkin left St. Petersburg to take command in
Manchuria he said he was going to Asia to dictate terms of
peace at Tokio. Well, he went, and from his first encounter
with the Japanese was outclassed and outfought. After Liaoyang he
fell back on Mukden, and after getting his breath assumed* the of
fensive and issued a proclamation in which he said. "We will now
compel the Japanese to do our will." The armies met and again Ku
ropatkin is in retreat. He has shown great ingenuity in inventing
terms to conceal disaster. After Liaoyang he cloaked his retreat
under the phrase in his report. "I changed position." In the last fight
he calls his retreat "a sagacious change in position."
To the military critics of Europe and this country his efforts
seem to be a useless sacrifice and a cause of unnecessary carnage. It
is not plain that Russia can get another army into Manchuria. The
Japanese will surely control the railroad to Harbin and perhaps be
yond. They change its gauge and have the rolling stock ready for
service. This means that they have rail facilities for troops, arms
and supplies, while the Russians have none. With Togo in control
of the Yellow Sea the Russians cannot use transports for troops, and
if they could it would be impossible by such means to land a suffi
cient force in Manchuria, Korea or at Vladivostok to match the Ja
panese army. V:' .
At present the sole hope for an end of the gory tragedy lies in
the crushing blows delivered by the troops of Oyama and the fall 61
Port Arthur. Japan has yet in reserve a fighting force of 1,100,000
men, with fier base close to the field of operations and the railroad for
military use. These things seem to equalise the two nations if their
soldiers were of equal fighting capacity. But it appears to be proved
that the Japanese are the superior soldiers. Kuropatkin would better
go home and open a small store.
ANOTHER RUSSIAN FAILURE.
A dainty example is affected by
means of a bouillonne of gathered net.
The net for the edge is simply cut in
strips and gathered each side so as
to leave a doubla heading as a finish,
then stitched to the edges of the
flchu. Smart bows of ribbon in front
complete an inexpensive and stylish
fichu.
When fashioning fichus almost any
little odds and ends can be used, but
nevertheless it is well to be careful
not to have too many kinds of mate
rial on one article. Nothing looks so
bad as ail old piece of silk or ribbon
on a practically new fichu or fancy
cape. The difference is apparent even
to the most untrained eye, and the
general appearance of a toilet is
spoiled rather than improved by the
addition of a carelessly put together
fichu.
The fashionable fichu is a thing of
beauty and a joy forever, and the
present style of dress, which has a
strong tendency toward the pic
turesque, lends itself particularly to
the pretty fichus which are now being
especially advocated by Dame Fash
ion.
Box coats quite loose are among the
most fashionable for general wear and
are rendered ,both novel and smart by
the introduction of collar and cuffs of
contrasting material. An attractive
model is made of navy blue cheviot
with collar and cuffs of white cloth
stitched and piped with velvet and is
quite as satisfactory to the wearer as
it is stylish and effective. The Hat
finish at the neck and the fly front
make specially noteworthy features,
together with the pockets which are
inserted in each front.
THE FASHIONABLE FICHU.
SMART BOX COATS.
An entire boa made of this part of
the peacock's plumage is beautiful.
(Especially go for one who has a terra
cotta chapeau with a peacock pom
pon.
The eyes of the tail feathers, so
glaringly conscicuous, play no part in
the present mode. It is the side feath
ers, those without eyes, that are used
to such splendid advantage. The gold
en, copper and bronze shades that
seem to encrust these deeply, richly
green feathers are superb of- them
selves. Made into a big, soft pompon
and placed on one of the new terra
cotta velvet hats the effect is as splen
did as it is novel. Each color exploits
the other. This part of the peacock's
plumage is better adapted to the dull,
rich terra-cotta shade than is the
often used reseda. In truth, a reseda
ostrich plume of the lovely clear shade
is a trifle too delicate for the true
terra-cotta. By contrast the terra
cotta, instead of seeming to glow, is
given a dead, sluggish cast. Not so thÂ«Â»
lovely peacock plumage. In a small
way it contains the terra-cotta qual
ity â the very shade appears in one of
its coppery hues. So for this reason
it seems to have been destined for
combining with terra-cotta.
Never has the plumage of Juno's
bird been so much worn by women.

It jumped and hopped, leaped and
fairly pranced, for its spiral joints
seemed unalterably opposed to quiet,
and evidently animated it with the de
sire to perform all sorts of "monkey
shines."
On the other hand, the one possessed
by Mrs. Tevis was more sedate and dig
nified and was probably fatigued after
its long Journey from Europe with its
owner, for it carried a tiny palm leaf
fan in one of its front paws, which
claimed its attention almost entirely.
Whenever Mrs. Tevis moved his mon
keyship used his fan. not possibly with
the coquettish grace of a Spanish senor
ita, but in quite a fetching manner,
nevertheless. He, too, was of black che
nille, as furry as a caterpillar, and stood
out in bold relief against the ecru ba
tiste background of his fair owners
gown.
In fact, the new bidders for fame,
which are about four inches high, bore
a close resemblance to these street toys
and danced with the agility of grass
hoppers. When the Countess Festetics
extended her hand to Mrs. Tevis in the
hall at Sherry's and told her how glad
she was to se her and how pretty she
looked, the black monkey performed
acrobatic feats in the air, dangling
from its elastic leash.
They wriggled and squirmed like
some giant insects, for they hung from
elastic threads attached to the women's
fingers. Every movement by these
leaders of fashion made the monkeys
dance and bob about, evidently to the
women's delight, for they seemed as
much amused with their chenille pets
as children might be with the wriggly
spiders sold by tJie fakers on Four
teenth street.
Fuzzy dwarf monkeys on wires are
the latest fad among women of the
fashionable set. These simian pets
made 'their debut at Sherry's, where
they were introduced to society at
luncheon by the Countess Festetics and
Mrs. Hugh Tevis. Unlike the kind that
Harry Lehr entertained at a Newport
dinner party last year they can be
carried anywhere and accompanied the
Countess and Mrs. Tevis into the res
taurant.
LATEST FAD AMONG
WOKEN OF SOCIETY
TRY YOUR HAND AT
THESE EASY RECIPES
CALIFORNIA is doing well these days. The Texas committee,
sent here to inspect our agriculture and horticulture, has is
sued a remarkable report, in which the methods of our farmers
are commended without stint. The Texans were struck by the thor
oughness of cultivation here. They found no corners left for weeds,
and were impressed by the cleanness of our fields, orchards and vine
yards: California soil is too good to be devoted to raising weeds, and
the long life of our fruit trees is caused by their thorough cultivation
and scientific pruning. An Eastern and Southern orchard is usually
found in grass or weeds. Pruning is an almost unknown art. The.
weeds and grass sap the substance of the soil and the trees die of
famine. The whole country can study with profit our methods. They
arc original here and if generally adopted will add to the productive
capacity of other States.
It is pleasant, too, to have our fruit packing commended, as it is
by the Texans, for it means that our producers and packers are heed
ing the often given admonition of The Call, that their permanent
market and prosperity depend upon strict observance of the princi
ples of commercial honor in preparing their material for market.
The Texas report is one of the best advertisements this State has
had, and it should be among the documents sent out by the various
organizations which are advertising the fame of the State.
At the St. Louis Exposition California wears the garlands.
The collective exhibit, which shows all together the resources of the
State, exceeds and excels that of any other # American St'ate or any
other country, and it has carried off all the medals and prizes which
can express its primacy. Our wine makers at first met the old trou
ble arising in the adopted foreign names for their vintages. But this
was overcome. It is a matter inherent in the cultivation here of for
eign wine grapes. All American grapes are of the slip skin variety.
The European and Oriental grapes have the skin adhering to the
pulp. These are the wine grapes and they are known here by the
names given them in the Old World and the names of our wines have
followed the nomenclature of the vineyard.
It is probable that from this time on a change will appear, and that
our wines will take on distinctive California names. This is very de
sirable, for our vintage is destined to be one of the greatest in the
world, and it should carry with it everywhere the name and fame of
the State. At present our wines appear on the lists of Eastern hotels
and dining cars under the general head "Domestic Wines," and are
therefore rated with the artificed wines made from the Eastern slip
grapes, which have to be stretched with sugar or alcohol. Bet
ter attention paid to the marketing and naming of our vintage will
put it where it belongs, in direct comparison with the French, Ger
man and Italian product-
Here again the principles of commercial honor will bring profit
to the State. No manipulated or filthy wine should be permitted to
go into consumption. It will pay California to take official oversight
of this matter and prevent the export of any wines that are not
sound. The temptation to repair defective fermentations or to put
young wines on the market by loading them with anti-ferments
should be removed by an inspection that will defeat the expectation
of profit to be gained by such means.
A foreign jury at the exposition gave first place to our olive oil,
but condemned our pickled olives for the benefit of the green im
ported pickle. The fact is that the two products are not in the same
class at all. The green olive is a pickle merely, a relish in the nature
of a condiment. Our ripe olive pickle is a delicious and nutritious
f'Â»od. It contains the ripened oil, is free stone and forms a desirable
addition to a strength producing diet. The coldness of the St. Louis
jury will not in any way injure it nor abridge its use.
Here again we have a distinctly Californian product that will
gain or lose in favor as the principles of commercial honor are ob
served or omitted in its preparation. The practice of dyeing our
olives or using a mordaunt to fix their color should be prohibited by
law. When they are properly treated by the formula issued by Pro
fessor Hayne there is no difficulty about their loss of color. Our
olive growers will go on putting up and selling our ripe olives and
the people will eat them and bless the sunshine of California in spite
<>f the lack of appreciation shown by the jury. The State could af
ford to hold a general harvest home festival in view of the good for
tune that has filled the vear.

By the REV. JOHN HEMPHILL, Pastor Calvary Presbyterian Church.
THE CONFLICT BETWEEN LABOR AND CAPITAL
chimney corner, reading her Bible,
speaking soothing words to the com
batants, bringing out of her big pocket
now and then a box of ointment for
their wounds, knowing little of what
is going on "in the world's broad field
of battle" and seeming to care less and
with no authority to say to the con
flicting forces. "Sirs, ye are brethren;
why do ye wrong one to another?" If
this be all that Christianity is and if
this be all that it can do, I do not see
that it has any valid claim upon the
attention of either capital or labor.
"Conduct is three-fourths of life,"
said the late Matthew Arnold, and
three-fourths of conduct has to do with
the industrial relations of life. If con
duct in the industrial realm is not un
der the lu-.v of God, then God is not
the King of men and never can be.
He â¢ who cannot speak the word of
power to capital and labor cannot sit
on the throne of the universe. He may
be King of saints; he is not King of
men. But we have not so read the
Bible. God is King of kings and Lord
of lords; King of nations, King of
saints. King of len. There is a king
dom of God on earth, . ich includes
all kingdoms and the final word in the
kingdom of industry and in every
other j kingdom must be the word of
God. and to attempt to carry on any
kind of industry without listening to
his word is the worst kind of disloyal
ty to him. Employers and employed
would do well to remember that they
belong to the human brotherhood and
that while they are fighting cne anoth-
cruelly. They forget that they are
brethren, members of one family. And
they are injuring not only themselves
but the whole human brotherhood. It
would be just as sane for two brothers
born of the same father and mother
to beat and try to kill each other as it
is for employers and employed to en
gage in such unbrotherly strife. Capi
tal cannot prosper by crippling labor
and labor cannot prosper by crippling
capital. Society is a unit, and if one
suffers, all suffer. This is the law of
Christian ethics. We cannot succeed
by the rtiin of our neighbor. Unity of
interests is the law of God. It is not
true because God teaches it. God
teaches it because it is true. We may
doubt it and deny it and fight against
it. but it is true, and the twentieth cen
tury will prove it. It is proved already.
"The survival of the fittest," "Nature
red in tooth and claw," was the gospel
preached by scientists not long ago,
but "Otherism," existence for the sake
of others, is the gospel preached by
scientists now. and it is the gospel
preached in the Bible from lid to lid.
A United States Senator was bold
enough to say on the floor of the Sen
ate chamber that "the thought that the
ten commandments had anything to do
with American politics was only an
iridescent dream." He might have in
cluded American industries. The law
of Gud, Christian ethics, has no
standing in the high courts of politics
and commerce. Christianity nowadays
is only a good-natured old grandmoth
er, sitting with her frilled cap in her
PROSPEROUS times do not
bring industrial peace. In
thirty-five years I have
never known more pros
perous times than we are
having now. Business men
are making money fast. Working men
are getting big wages and constant
employment: and yet th^ clash be
tween employers and employed contin
ues. We hear the sullen roar of it at
frequent intervals, like the dash of
angry waves agair.st a rock-bound
coast. "War ip hell." said the late
General Sherman. Industrial war is
hell. Napoleon conquered a country
and called it peace, but it was the
peace of desolation. Employers may
win in the industrial fight that is upon
us h*re and everywhere, or employed,
and call it peace, but whoever wins,
tht-y are saying. "'Peace, peace, when
thÂ«rre is no peace." Our industries can
be built ui> neither on the basis of con-
Tzct nor contract. Carlyle says: "Love
of rm-n cannot be bought by cash, and
without love men cannot endure to bt
together."
The strife between capital and labor
is at once suicidal, fratricidal and
humirMal. It kill? the brother, self and
society. When the great Law-giver of
Israel found two Hebrews quarreling
ho said to them. "Sirs, ye are brethren;
why do ye wrong one to another?"
This strife between employers and em
ployed is unbrotherly. unnatural, a

of California. Granting the necessity
of maintaining institutes in earlier
days, Mr. Barker contends that with
recent developments in educational fa
cilities more practical means now' exist
which enable teachers to keep abreast
with professional thought and practice.
He favors the summer school as a
substitute, even though the attend
ance be voluntary.
To Duncan Stirling, Superintendent
of Monterey County, the benefits of the
Institute as a social and inspirational
force far outweigh its disadvantages.
As a possible substitute he suggests
that teachefs be employed with provi
sion for gradual increase of salary for
five years, conditioned upon four or
six weeks* attendance each year at a
summer normal school. Further pro
vision should also be made to relieve
the County Superintendent of all cleri
cal labor, to enable him to properly su
perintend the schools.
From the standpoint of an experi
enced educator, Frederic Burk, pres
ident of the San Francisco Normal,
states his conclusions. He believes
"that the cost of institutes is fully
justified by the enthusiasm and spirit
resulting from bringing the teachers
together for a week and Inspiring
them, through common fellowship,
with the ideals of their profession."
Institutes, however, are not, in Mr.
Burk's opinion, successful in enabling
teachers to realize a broad horizon of
scholarship, or in furnishing oppor
tunities for personal instruction In
either the subjects or the methods of
teaching. He points to the marked
successes of the summer schools at Saa
Jose and Berkeley as indicating a su
perior course by which may be ob
tained desired proficiency In technical
training and in reaching high scholar
ship.
The Superintendent of Public Tn^
struction, Thomas J. Kirk, has a wlds
outlook, for hia duties require his at
tendance at all institutes which ho can
reach. Superintendent Kirk respondi
to the questions presented by Tha
Call by saying that until a better pro
vision can be made, the teachers' in
stitute is an indispensable educational
factor. He states that Just criticisms
are offered of those institutes which
ere given over to excessive entertain
ment or to mere theorizing, but that
the average institute Is helpful and in
spiring. There Is need of constant
stimulus and uplift in the teacher**
work, and the suggestion is given that
a week or more spent each year at
those ideal places for professional
training, the department of education
in the State University or at a sum
mer normal, may prove a desirable
substitute for the institute.
Considered Beneficial by Some Educators, While Others Favor a Substitute
THE VALUE OF THE TEACHERS' INSTITUTE
er in their combinations of capital to
get the better of labor and of labor
to get the better of capital, they are
fighting against the laws of the Ruler
of the universe; a conflict which can
issue in no benefit to either, but in
much injury to both and to society.
What is the remedy for the indus
trial war? One of two things: First,
a national board of arbitration. Let
capital name one arbitrator, labor
another, and the President of the
United States a third, and let these
three men be clothed with authority
to settle all disputes between capital
and labor as they arise. Second, co
partnership of some sort. Christianity
found slavery existing, and while it
did not set itself to overthrow it by
direct onset, it enunciated principles
which inevitably overthrew it. To
slavery the wage-earning system suc
ceeded. Is this the final form of the
kingdom of industry? I do not think
so. I look upon the present collision
between employers and employed as
the birth pangs of another and higher
form â the final form. Under the
wage system we ' have two great
standing armies, capital on the one
hand and labor on the other, fighting
each other as fiercely on the soil of
this free America of ours as Jap and
Slav are fighting each other on the
soil of Manchuria, Is this the best
that the wage system can do? Is it
the best that Christianity can do? I
do not believe that Christianity con
templates the maintenance of stand
ing armies of any sort. I believe the
angels meant something when they
dustrial enterprise is in essential fact
and justice a joint enterprise, it Is go
ing to be recognized as such. Right
prevails in the long run.
We owe much to the men of the
nineteenth cen&ry, who gave us travel
by steam and talk by lightning. We
shall owe more to the man of the
twentieth century, who shall bring us
Industrial peace. And he is comlnj?. for
when the time calls for a man God has
always a man ready to answer the call.
A born leader of men shall emerge in
the twentieth century, who shall show
the way to that peaceful reconstruction
of our industries by which capital and
labor shall be identified and peace per
manently established among the sons
of men. Who is the coming man? Mr.
Parker? If so. I trust he shall be elect
ed to the highest office in the gift of
the American people â yea. the highest
office in the gift of **ie world. Theo
dore Roosevelt? If so, I trust he shall
be elected to succeed himself. Indus
trial peace Is coming, whoever brings
it. Society is a unit. The law of civil
ization, as of Christianity, is "each for
all and all for each." Industrial war
injures each and alL It will not do for
an employer to say: "This business Is
mine and I'm going to run it to suit
myself." It will not do for a workman
to say: "The members of the union to
which I belong are the only ones whose
welfare is to be considered." Each
must act for the interests of all, and
when we ail act that way we shall
have reached the end of the years of
strife and have come to the beginning
of the thousand years of peace of which

sang on that first Christmas morning
"Peace on earth, good will to men."
I believe that the time will come, and
early In the twentieth century, too,
when employers and employed shall
beat their swords into plowshares and
their spears into prunlng-hooks and
learn industrial war no more. That
is a consummation devoutly to be
wished, for the wage system as it
works now is simply organized war.
The sooner employers recognize the
fact that their workmerAare their part

have industrial peace and prosperity.

to go too fast and upset the industrial
coach. There are difficulties In the way.
Capital can live on its own fat In "the
winter of its discontent." Labor's fat,
being all lean, must starve, but a way
will be found. There are hosts of
wage-earners, tired of useless and cost
ly strife, ready for the copartnership
plan and there are hosts of employees
ready to meet their men half way. The
solution of the industrial difficulty lies
in the identification of the interests
of the men who do the work with
those of the men who direct it. Car
lyle wrote half a century ago, "whether
in some not far-distant age your mas
ter worker may not find it possible and
needful to grant his workers permanent
interest in his enterprise and theirs, so
that it becomes in practical result what
in essential fact and justice it ever is,
a joint enterprise." It seems to me

those whose opinion is
strongly affirmative. They believe that
this feature of the State's educational
work has passed its highest influence
and that more effective means should
be employed for the development and
upbuilding of teachers.
Teachers' institutes were first legally
recognized in this State in 1SG3. In 1S70
the law was changed so that it required
the superintend ' of each county of a
certain size to annually hold an insti
tute and also required the attendance
of ev< : y public school teacher. Hence
for a generation teachers' institutes
have been a compulsory feature of the
schc )1 law of California.
With the view of learning the cur
rent opinions or this subject. The Call
has requested the views of some of the
school pupcrintendents upon the value
of teachers' institutes and upon any
possible substitutes and by their cour
tesy is enabled to present these here
with. Tbey are wholly from officials in
the northern part of the State.

ers' Institutes? There are
C. I* McLane, Superintendent of
Fresno schools, believes that though
there are some advantages derived
from a course of lectures which are
sometimes given, the institutes are, as
far as the city schools are concerned,
a mere waste of time and money. This
because the city teacher is accustomed
to frequent conferences and grade
meetings where are discussed the prob-
progress in any body of teachers which
docs not meet frequently for the dis
cussion of school questions. Cities and
thickly settled communities could de
vise a satisfactory substitute, but I
see no other alternative for the great
majority of the country teachers of this
State. The institute is in a large meas
ure what the Superintendent is who
planned it."
County Superintendent A. A. Bailey
of Contra Costa vrites: "In my judg
ment teachers' institutes are, as a rule,
well managed and are a decided ad
vantage to cur schools. They elevate
and Inspire the teacher; they bring es
sentials to the front; they demolish
fads and keep the teacher out of edu
cational ruts. If attended, summer
schools would accomplish the same re
sults, but few would attend them with
out pay. Again, after months of weari
some labor the teacher is entitled to a
real vacation and recuperative rest.
Let the law stand as it is."
By the Amador County Superintend
ent, George A. Gordon, the view is en
tertained that the institute is an oc
casion when discussion of methods of
teaching should have special attention.
To be most effective, illustration
should be had by a skilled teacher
with a class of children. As a draw
back to the success of institutes h^d
In mountain counties, Mr. Gordon re
fers to the difficulty experienced in se
curing the best lecturers at ; points
which are remote from the lines of
railway travel. He thinks that, ulti
mately, the institute will' be supplant
ed by a summer course of training at
a normal school.
The Superintendent of the Eureka
schools, A. C. Barker, holds the opin
ion that the results of the institutes
are not justified by the expense. This
he estimates in the aggregate for the
whole State at $160,000 per annum â a
sum equal to 75 per cent of the cost
of supporting the five normal schools
wide-awake, questioning Superintend
ent. The educational conditions must
be thought upon, they must be lived
with day by day, they must be checked
up by reading, they must be compared
with better and worse conditions. When
the point to be improved has been de
termined upon it should become the
pivot around which all the work of the
institute centers."
learn methods, of other teachers, her
horizon will broaden and she will be
come enthusiastic In her chosen work."
It Is the belief of J. W. McClymonds,
the Oakland Superintendent, that the
institutes have been of the highest
value to California schools. Consider
ing the changes brought about by pro
fessional training of teachers, Mr. Mc-
Clymonds thinks that institutes must
also change to accord with the needs of
the teaching profession. The greatest
latitude should be permitted the County
Superintendent in determining the na
ture of his own institute.
Miss Kate Ames, Superintendent of
Napa County, is strongly impressed
with the power for good which can be
exercised through well-conducted insti
tutes. In fact, she believes that their
value is limited only by the ability of
the Superintendent to adapt the exer
cises to existing conditions. For social
influences and for spiritual upliftingsâ
besides being the Superintendent's sole
Opportunity for close supervisionâ the
Institute presents opportunities that are
unsurpassed. Miss Ames adds that "at
present the readjustment of teachers
and teaching to the new courses of
study made necessary by the adoption
of the new textbooks gives an occasion
for institutes of great practical value.
The specific details and needs of the
county can be determined only by the
A wiser use of this money would be
to invest it In six weeks' attendance at
a summer school, even once In two
years.
The convictions of O. W. Erlewine,
Superintendent of the Sacramento
schools, are after twenty-five years of
observation that "the institutes are
very valuable to those engaged in
school work. They afford that sort of
necessary Instruction and inspiration
to a large majority of the teachers of
this State that would be difficult to ob
tain in any other way." Mr. Erlewine
believes that summer schools are doing
noble work, but that their scope is too
limited to take the place of Institutes.
In the view of D. H. White, Superin
tendent of Solano County, "the value of
the institute depends entirely upon the
individual teacher. If she regards the
institute as a means of helpfulness In
her every day problems and is deter
mined to realize every advantage af

believes that there is some excuse for

country schools, but such meetings

claims that the average cost per teach

teacher's salary and her personal ex
penses, is about fifty dollars.
build the bones and otner tissues of
the body. Of course all of the ma
terial that goes to make growth Is
originally In solution in the blood, from
which it is deposited in the form of
bone, muscle, tissue, etc. If while
growth is still going on the rate of
deposition can be accelerated the hu
man being or other animal will grow
faster. Apparently this ts the way in
which the lecithin works, by stimulat
ing normal growth.
Lecithin is defined by Dr. H. W.
Wiley as a fat In which phosphorus has
replaced part of the hydrogen. In sim
ple language, it is an organic com
pound of phosphorus.- While egg yolks
contain an extraordinary percentage of
it, it is also found in seeds, wherein it
is stored to furnish material for the
growth of the embryo plantâ just as in
the egg It helps the development of the
unhatched chick. It Is, in fact, na
ture's own "grow stuff" and occurs
wherever food is stored for the use of
the embryo plant or animal. From it,
â¢Dr. Wiley says, we mainly derive the
phosphorus which helps to nourish the
brain, nerves and other tissues of the
body.
Drs. Wiley and Maxwell have per
formed some Interesting experiments
with eggs to find out what becomes of
the phosphorus In the lecithin of the
yolk. It was a difficult problem of
chemical analysis, but Its solution
proved that during the process of Incu
bation the organic phosphorus of the
lecithin is transformed into thÂ« inor
ganic phosphorus of the bones of tht
chick.

the trials have not been extended to

in regard to the best methods of treat

One of the most interesting conclu
sions. drawn by Dr. Danilewsky is that

mals 1 under trial were invariably of
the same litter, ;were red on the same
kind of food (a plain vegetable diet
of corn, carrots and cabbage) and were
weighed every two days. Taking an
average it was found tnat the lecithin
rats grew 60 per cent faster than the
rats reared in the ordinary way, and it
was about the same with the guinea
pigs.
Dr. Koch tried the "grow, stuff", upon
guinea, pigs and rats. Having boiled
taken from the same litters, some be
ing dosed and others not and, apart
from the special treatment, were
brought up under exactly the Bame

Dr. DanllewBky found that tadpoles
dosed with lecithin grew much faster
than pollywogs which did not have the
treatment, while frogs' eggs placed in
Â¦water containing one fifteen-hundredth
part of the substance gained in flfty
four days three hundred per cent more
in weight than other eggs of the same

In the lecithin contained in the yolks.

Maxwell, have performed some elabor
ate experiments with the "grow B tuff."
So have Dr. Koch of Berlin and Dr.
Danilewsky of Paris, who have utilized
many kinds of animals, from frogs to
chickens, in their investigations. They
found that puppies fed with regular
doses of lecithin not only grew faster
than puppies reared In the ordinary
way, but were stronger, more lively,
developed thicker and silkier hair and
seemed to be perceptibly more intelli
gent. In order to avoid error as far as

ciety, where more than twenty varieties
of dishes, including soup, bread, pastry,
fruit, jellies, coffee and candies, were
served, all made from bananas. The in
ventor claimed that armies and navies,

availed of would avert famine and star

Numerous articles have been written
on the open secret of living on 5 to 30
cents a day, and many of these exposi
tions have a strong foundation In fact.
Indeed there are thousands of persons
who have reduced their diet to the min
imum, not on account of deficient
strength or a condition of ill health,
nor yet poverty, who are nevertheless
convinced that wheat, oats, beans, len
tils and all kinds of fruit and nuts are
far more nutritious than a meat diet.
The peasantry of Europe are'particu
larly strong for the reason that they
not only never overeat, but the greater
share of their diet consists of fruits and
vegetablesâ the Irish, for Instance, sur
viving largely on oatmeal and potatoes,
the Chinese on rice and the creatures
of the tropics on fruits and nuts. Con
trast this with the ordinary table d'hote
diner, who not only mixes, twelve to
fifteen different kinds of food at a meal,
but "washes It down" with cheap wine
and ice water.
The following will serve to contrast a
meat diet with one of cereals, fruit and
vegetables. It Is taken from the Gov
ernment reports:
In a meat diet the proportion of
nitrogenous (muscle-building) material
scattered through the city, where all
sorts of cereal and vegetable foods may
be found served up raw or in some ap
petizing form.
The pastor of the church is also pres
ident of the Vegetarian Society, a vet
eran of the craft, the Rev. Henry S.
Clubb, who has eschewed all forms of
animal diet for nearly four score years
and believes that he is good for a full
century. "Flesh eating animals are
shorter lived than those that live on
plant life." Is ' the reverend's creed.
"The elephant Is the strongest and
longest lived, the rhinoceros the heav
iest, the deer the swiftest and the
horse the most intelligent, all non-flesh
eating creatures. Why then may not
man, eschewing meat, attain a superior
degree of strength, live longer, expend
greater mental and physical energy and
achieve a higher degree of intellectual
ity?" The argument certainly seems
reasonable.
Some few years ago an American
traveler In South America was amazed
to discover the wanton waste of mil
lions of tons of bananas every year
enough nourishment to feed the entire
human family if properly used. He
made scientific tests, found that ba
nana flour was more than a hundred
times as nutritious as the same weight
of wheat flour and sixty times as pro
lific to the acre.
He went to work to build drying kilns
of the most approved plan, with the
end in view to take up a large percent
age of the banana crop that otherwise
went to waste. He also entered into
the scientific cookery side, and not long
since gave a banana dinner in New
partment at Washington, affirmed re
cently that "vegetarianism is the next
food fad of the century." The professor
continued: "Man is an omnivorous ani
mal, but meat is by no means essential
to health and strength. Twenty-five
per cent of the meat sold in the. open
market possesses little or no nutritive
elements." The leading argument in
favor of meat eating is based upon the
taste, which is largely extracted in the
oils, so that if we spread shavings with
sufficient gravy a dog will eat the dish,
while if we spread the same upon meat
from which all nutriment has been ex
tracted, leaving only the fibre, no more
health giving than sawdust, it will still
have a certain palatable' taste to hu
man, beings. "The cheapest cereals
corn, wheat, oats, rye, rice, etc. â pos
sess the highest degree of nutrition, to
gether with the heat and energy neces
sary for hard labor,"' says Professor
Wiley, "and it is remarked that in
times of war armies which are strongly
meat eaters work furiously only dur
ing the period of the , quick digestion
of the meat diet, whereas the cereal
dietarians possess far greater powers
of endurance."
It is probably in the Quaker town of

taurants as well as their under clerks.
In a cereal and fruit meal costing a
few cents it is possible to receive as
much nutriment and sustaining energy
as from a meal of meat costing ten
times as much, with the added ad
vantage that the man does not ex
pend so much energy in his digestive
process and is consequently able to
perform better, work with a clearer
head than he otherwise could do.
I have made a careful study of the
best diet for athletes in training as
well as for men in the intellectual
walks of life, 1 and I believe firmly that
the non-meat eaters surpass the om
niverous brethren, ai: things being
equal, in mind, body, forcefulness of
character and endurance."

Attorney Frank J. Murphy, on behalf
of William Buckley,, under sentence of
death for the murder of George W.
Rice, a non-union machinist, at Twen
tieth and Howard streets on October 11,
1901, forwarded to Governor Pardee yes
terday a petition asking for a further
reprieve of thirty days. The date now
fixed for the execution ia October 28.
Accompanying the petition were two
affidavits. One was by Alfred Rosen
holtz, a chemist, living at 2995 Folsom
street. He alleges that he was on the
same car as Rice and on the side on
which the phots were fired. He heard
two shots behind him, and turning
round he saw Rice's body on the
ground and a man blazing away at the
body. He had a good look at the man,
who wore a black hat, black coat and
black trousers. He was heavily' built,
square-shouldered, weighed about ISO
pounds, broad face and dark, florid
complexion.. Rosenholtz noticed the
maji running away and he had a roll-
Ing gait. The reason he had kept quiet
so long was that he had an aversion to
getting mixed up in such a case.
The importance of this affidavit is the
discrepancy between Buckley's appear
ance and dress and the man alleged by
Rosenholtz to have fired the shots.
Buckley at the time wore a gray hat
and gray trousers and weighed about
140 pounds. His face is not broad and
his complexion is light.
The other affidavit was by Detective
T. L. Ryan. He avers that two or three
days after the murder he was informed
that John Gran field, who lived on How
ard street, between Sixth and Seventh,
had done the -clubbing, and that
"China" Copland, who lived "on Fulton
street, between Larkln and Polk, had
done the shooting. Ryan went to both
places and found that the men had dis
appeared on the night of the murder.
Copland had been on picket duty at the
Union Iron Works up to October 10, the
day prior to the murder, but had failed
to report for duty next morning. He
was convinced that Buckley did not fire
the shots, and offered to go before the
Governor and make a full explanation.
Murphy says he will send the Gov
ernor more affidavits from passengers
on the car In a few days.

and Detective T. L. Eyan
Believe in His Innocence
Street has a wife, but no children.
Mrs. Street is not living in this city at
present. It is believed that the missing
captain played the races and quietly
launched himself on a career that made
him a deserter and a defaulter.
"Well. Mr. Burke," he said, "I can't
go with you any farther. I have con
cluded to remain ashore. You have a
fair start, so take the ship to San
Francisco and turn her over to the
owner. Guess I'll not see you again, so
good-by."
To the astonished mate's queries the
deserting skipper made not a single ex
planation. He called the sma-11 boat
alongside, went over the ship's side and
was rowed to the tug, which returned
to Newcastle. Burke took command of
the vessel and navigated her to this
port.
Captain C. Ryder, who owns the El
w?!l, said last evening that he knew
no reason for Street's strange deser
tion cf the ship, as he was known to
be a level-headed navigator and an ex
perienced seaman.
"But there is a clew," added Captain
Ryder, "which may clear the way. All
the freight money in the ship went with
the runaway. How much is missing I
cannot tell, hih it will be a considerable
loss I am afraid. I never knew Street
to dissipate and do not know when or
where he squandered that money. I
suppose he did this, however, and was
afraid to come home and face the mu
sic."
Captain A. F. WV Street deserted his
ship, the Elwell, six miles outside of
Newcastle, Australia, on August 6.
With the recreant skipper went all the
freight money aboard the vessel. The
Elwell was about to start on her trip
for this port.
The Elwell arrived here yesterday
with 2100 tons of coal, seventy days
from Newcastle, in charge of Chief Of
ficer Burke. Burke says they were
towed out to sea from Newcastle Aug
ust 6. He noticed a shore boat and a
boatman towing astern of the ship as
*-he passed out to sea, and he learned
that the boat was there by the cap
tain's order.
Ater the Elwell was well clear of the
land and was beginning to make sail
Captain Street surprised his officers by
appearing on deck with his overcoat on
hiÂ£ arm and a small valise with him.

LONDON. Oct. 15.â The four brides
maids at the wedding of Lady Her
mione Grimston. daughter of T. Veru
lam, wore sandals, and their naked,
shapely feet attracted pardonable ad
miration at the church. Instead of
gloves they wore mittens and other
wise complete early Victorian cos
tumes. The Grimstons have cultivated
the wearing of sandals and their feet
looked quite fitted to them, but the feet
of ordinary women cramped ln narrow
pointed boots scarcely would bear the
exposure.

PARIS, Oct. 13. â Widespread and un
favorable comment has been aroused
by the recent use of the park at Ver
sailles for reproducing highly sensa
tional episodes, supposed to have bee"h
witnessed during the time of Louis XV.
Dressed in costumes of that period
more than a hundred persons rode to
Versailles and were rapidly driven
to the park. The gates were closed and
the public barred.
The great fountains that play rarely
were turned on and the party proceed
ed to the famous colonnade grove, in
Â¦which is the beautiful marble bath.
"Women in scantiest costumes posed as
a group representing Proserpine car
ried off by Pluto.
Women posing as water nymphs next
proceeded to Apollo's bath and a scan
dalous scene was enacted. Half-clothed
women 1 * fought a duel arranged for a
cinematograph through the influence of
a high state official.

The following' interesting dUpatch concern
ing the light weight of spring Wheat was re
ceived from Chicago yesterday: "Millers are ;
getting scared at the waj\.ibis .new eprlag .,
V.'heat is turning out. said President R B. \
Johnston of the Sur and Crescent Milling !
I Company. None of them realized when they :
Â¦ started out that It took an average of about I
I twenty pounds more Wheat to make a barrel [
I of similar grades. Flour that formerly re- j
quired four bushels and thirty pounds of Wheat !
i to the barrel is now calling for four bushels j
I and fifty pounds. I think that all of the. soft
i winter Wheat in Southern territory will also
bo found to require about ten pounds more to
make a barrel than last year." .

not selling. Some are now asking $4 :55, but
this price has not yet been paid. Pea are

A local handler says that the California crop
of Beans will probably be no more than suf
ficient to supply the coast demand, as the
rain-damaged Beans are fit neither for eating
no r seeding. He further says that the reports
circulated of bumper crops in the East are not
fully indorsed here, as they are considered
circulated by buyers who want to secure sup
plies.

CHICAGO, Oct. 15â The wheat market was
strong from the start. The. fact- that foreign
grain markets followed yesterday's sharp ad
vance here furnished considerable encourage
ment to bull traders. Advlcea from Arcen
tlt.a also were bullish, the weather there be
ing reDorted as extremely unfavorable. . The .
element of .perhaps the greatest importance,
rxwever was the continued active demand
for cash wheat and apparent scarcity of that
article. Shorta and commission houses were
urgent bidders for the December option when
the trading began, but offerings were ex
tremely light. After opening unchanged to
<*e higher at $1 12%@1 13%, the price of
December rose rapidly to *1 14H- May was
helped by the strength of December and after
opening &QUc lower to H04*c higher at
$1 12 to 51 12%, sold up to Â«1 13. On the
advance numerous realizing sales were made,
resulting in a temporary setback. December
declined to $1 13%, while May sold off to
$1 12'-*@1 12^5. The bulis soon regained con
trol of the situation and during the remainder
of the session the market held remarkably
firm. Trading was confined matniy to the De
cember oDtlon. The most prominent influence
affecting late trading was a message from
Duluth to a commission house confirming: a
rumor circulated here yesterday to the effect
that Northwestern millers are buying Manl
toba xrtieat. The market closed strong, with
December T-Â»c higher at $1 13}j- Final quo
tations on May were ' 4 c up at $1 12%Q.l 12 >j.
In sDite of the strength of wheat, the corn
market was quite weak. Favorable crop pros
pects and excellent weather conditions created
a bearish sentiment. The market closed at
the lowest point, December at 4lH4c, a loss
of "4c.
Moderate liquidation caused weakness in
oats. December closed %c lower at 28Vic.
Provisions were firm on fair buying by pit
traders and us a result of support by packers.
At the close January pork was up 12 %c. lard

A further drop In Alaska Packers from $120
to $117 under small sale* attracted jjeneral. at
tention yesterday and set the street gueaslns
as to the cause, for which several reasons
were assigned by the brokers. One was that
the large indebtedness of the company had
led a number of parties to unload their stock:
another was- manipulation; and a third was
that the company was contemplating an issue
of more stock. It was said that of the 50.000
shares capital stock 48,000 have been lasued
Â«nd that the remaining' 2000 are now to bÂ«
sold.- It' was argued however, â¢ that Issu
ance of- these 2C00 share* would bo about suf

Along the Market street front on the mezzanine
floor extend the cash and wrapping departments,
and here a long string of girls is kept constantly
busy. On this floor also may be found a postofllce,
Another fine department store has been added to
the exceptional mercantile institutions of the city
by the opening of Pragers, at the intersection of
Market, Jones and McAllister streets. The Immense
Murphy building, formerly the home of business of
fices, has been fitted up in elaborate style, and San
Francisco shoppers will enjoy a treat by visiting
the store, which will be the largest of its kind west
of Chicago.
In making the changes and fitting up the place
the management has endeavored In every way to
make the comfort of visitors and buyers the first
consideration. Large waiting-rooms, attendants,^
modern conveniences of every description and wide,
spacious aisles are features of the entire building.
And not alone the comfort of shoppers, but the
welfare of the hundreds of girls that are employed
by the concern is looked to with as great care â well-
Hghted workrooms and counters, dining-rooms and
retiring-rooms, and, in fact, every convenience to
make their work pleasant and agreeable.
The main entrance leads into a wide main aisle,
over the center of which is a large court, where the
daylight streams down and floods every floor. This,
in addition to the light received from the Market,
Jones and Golden Gate avenue frontages, makes the
Prager building by far the most airy and best
lighted Btore on the Pacific Coast. The court is one
of the most attractive features of the building, and
the store management has taken advantage of this,
fact by placing chairs along the balconies facing
the court so that the occupants may command a
view of the lower floors. The court is also deco
rated by rows of electric bulbs, lighted at night,
and at the top are placed oil paintings of irfany Pa
cific Coast scenes.
As one enters the store on the left Is to be found
the department devoted to the needs of man â cigar
and tobacco, clothing, shoes and men's furnishing
goods. The remainder of the floor is devoted to the
requirements of femininity. A feature of each floor
Is the fact that the shelves for storing goods are
not over five feet in height, thus enabling one to
obtain a clear view of the entire floor.

over now, and let all the blame rest on
poor, unfortunate George. You know
well that I would have made you a
good husband instead of taunting me
as you did and making me out to be a
fool, and worse. Weli, darling, remem
ber, if you by any chance should be
questioned about this affair you know
strictly nothingâ simply that I was one
of the many suckers that passed
through your hands, and you can rest
assured that there will be nothing from
me. Now, dearest love, I think you
ought to take a tumble and quit the
game. Try and settle down to a quiet
home life, and don't hurry yourself into
the grave, for remember, even If I am
gone, I will still be able to watch you,
and as you have sent me below, so I
will wait and watch for you unless you
turn over an entirely new leaf. Every
time you get drunk I will certainly
haunt you, but If you lead a good life
from now onâ well, I won't have lived
in vain. Good-by, dearest. Think some
times of me as the man who died for
you. GEORGE TAVENDALE."
The following letter from the suicide
was also found:

I could find one in you. I am financial

LETTER TO GLADYS.
Tavendale was a furnishing goods
clerk and had been employed some time
ago by Eagleson and Welnstock & Lu
bln. From correspondence found among
his effects it was evident that he loved
the actress, whose real name is Roberta
"Warner, and that he had been sending
her money from time to time. Her in
temperate habits and her coldness to
ward him had disgusted him, and
there is no doubt that he took his life
while under a spell of melancholy.
The following note from the girl was
found in the room:
EMPLOYED AS CLERK.
â â¢ -
With a curse upon his lips and a
threat that his ghost will haunt the
woman he loved, James Tavendale
passed out of life last Friday night.
His body was found in his bed yester
day morning at 337 Eddy street. One
end of a rubber tube was between his
teeth and the other end affixed to a gas
burner. On the dresser near the bed
was a note to Gladys Grey, an actress
at the Casino Theater, in Sacramento,
In which the following passage occurs:
"For remember, even If I am gone, I
will still be able to watch you, and as
you have sent me to death so I will
wait and watch for you unless you turn
over an entirely new leaf."

public telephone booths, manicure, halrdresslng and barber parlors.
Ice cream and candy counters have been placed near the east ele
vators. A bureau of information for the convenience of visitors haÂ«
been installed.
On the second floor are the business offices, cloak and suit rooms,
millinery and draperies. Here, as on all the other floors, commo
dious retiring-rooms for women are placed conveniently. Arouni
the court on this floor are lounging chairs, from which a fine view
of the interior may be gained.
The third floor is given over to kitchen utensils, crockery, toys.
artists' supplies and pictures. A three-room picture gallery for
display Is an attractive feature, as Is also the special booth for the
display of fancy cut glass. In connection with the picture gallery
Is a room for the manufacture of frames and mats. Separate
rooms for card writers and checking clerks and a handsome mu
sic department complete the third floor.
Groceries and liquors occupy the entire fourth floor, with the
exception of a space reserved for the cafe, which is light and pleas
ant and affords a view of Market street. The kitchen, adjoining
the cafe, is admirably fitted to secure proper ventilation and the
carrying away of cooking odors.
On the fifth or top floor may be found a decidedly novel and
progressive feature of the store. On the entire Jones street side Is
a large space apportioned off for a stage and vaudeville hall. Here
visitors may soon enjoy vaudeville sketches; songs and music at
the company's expense. The rest of the floor is used by the trunk,
valise, sporting goods and a number of other departments. On this
floor will be a booth where customers may select premiums for the
trading stamps Issued by the store. A dining-room for the em
ployes Is also located on the'top floor.
The management of Pragera has spared no expense In mak
ing the store a place where almost anything may be purchased,
from a ton of coal to a harvesting machine. Nor have they neg
lected the material side of the business in regard to shipping and
consigning of goods. Freight elevators carry the bales and bundles
from floor to floor, as the four large passenger elevators carry tha
shoppers. Chutes and telephones connect departments with storage
and shipping rooms. Broad staircases and wide exits, fire-escapes
and flre-flghting devices make the building safe.
A large basement that extends under the entire store Is devoted
to the storage of goods and the housing of the receiving and ship
ping departments. On one side Is located the receiving department,
where carloads of supplies are received and sent to the proper
places in the store, while on the other the shipping department at
tends to the wrapping and marking of goods, sends them up to
the waiting wagons on Jones street and from there the merchan
dise is whirled away to the purchasers throughout the city.
The formal opening of the entire building will take place to-mor
row, and some fine features have been prepared for the entertain
ment of visitors. A grand orchestral concert will be given from !
until 5 o'clock p. m., and a magnificent programme has been ar
ranged.

whose shoulders the weight of the

upon their work. Augustus C. Keane,

SPOONER ACT
TO BE TESTED

QUAKER CITY
"Ajax," after a series of disasters
sufficient to make another Greek
tragedy, was yesterday morning suc
cessfully performed at the Greek The
ater in Berkeley. The first catastro
phe was the illness of Miss Mabel Hay
Barrows, In whose charge was the
whole direction of the play and who
was also the Tecmessa of the cast.
Then followed the illness of the
choreagus and other important mem
bers of the chorus. Rehearsals
sagged arid at length it became evi
dent that the performance had to be
postponed. The proverbial ill luck
followed the postponement. In the
haste of the final rehearsals insuf
ficiently clear notice of the time of the
performance was sent out and all the
way from 10 o'clock' yesterday morn
ing â when it began â until 3 o'clock
yesterday afternoon Greek-hungry
bands strove up the Parnassan
heights.
Xor could they have striven to
much better purpose. The perform
ance, in spite of everything, was
uniquely beautiful. Possibly 2000
people managed to be there in time
for it and will hardly be likely soon
to forget the experience.
The Greek play they have had
there before, "The Birds" of Aristo
phanes. Shakespeare they have had
there. But not before have they had
a Greek play with a Greek audience,
as yesterday.
Miss Barrows was responsible for
this most admired innovation. In fact,
the evidence of this clever young
woman's acute Hellenic sympathies
and wide experience in her work was
patent throughout the production. It
was, by the way., the beauty of the
Greek theater that tempted Miss Bar
rows to undertake the "Ajax."
And what a setting it is! And what
a day of the gods was yesterday!
Before the play came a prelude that
pitched things in true Athenian key.
A white altar to Apollo stood in the
midst of the orchestra, that was also
devoted to the performance. To this,
to music, Lydian and Dorian of fash
ion, came troops of Athenian citizens
from the stage, ivy-crowned, bare
armed, flowing and glowing of gown.
You've seen the kind of thing in Alma
Tadema's Greek confections, or Sir
Frederick Poynter's. Children there
were, carrying baskets of roses to the
altar, young girls with hyacinthine
hair, brown-armed men with wine for
the altar, purple-gowned women. They
moved in stately procession down the
steps to the orchestra and gathered
about the altar. There the priests
poured the libations, burned little
cakes to the gods, offered up the roses,
while the . maids of Athens sang the
Delphic Hymn. to Apollo. They after
ward disposed â¢ themselves | on the or
chestra steps, lounging on cushion* aa

lican party: Since the Republicans
began, every President, according to
the Democrats, has violated the con
stitution. ' "When Abraham Lincoln was
endeavoring to maintain the Union hft
was violating the constitution. In, his
next campaign every act was a viola
tion. They then contended that the
constitution prohibited the Govern
ment's spending money on internal im
provements, and that national banks
were in violation of the constitution.
We find some Democrats willing to be
presidents of national banks, and some
of them are managers of Parker's cam
paign.
''The homestead act, which has done
more to build up this Western country
man any other legislation, was uncon
stitutional. Every act put into effect
by the Republican party, every act that
has beÂ«n , particularly, beneficial, de
clared at the time to be unconstitu
tional, was afterward adopted by Dem
ocrats as the law .of the land. Even
as late as four years ago we find acts,
then claimed by our opponents to be
unconstitutional, now quoted, as au
thorities. From 1856 to the present day
the Democratic party has been from
four to twenty years behind the times.
We find the party that denounced Ab
raham Lincoln in bitter terms quoting
him to-day. Why, we find Mr. Parker
going back only four years and calling
upon President Roosevelt to follow the
great and beloved William McKlnley.
We do not find him pointing with pride
and asking the President to follow in
the steps of- G rover Cleveland, or the
doctrines of William Jennings Bryan.

A demonstration that tells of victory
in November for the Republican par
ty of San Francisco took place at the
Alhambra Theater last evening. This
demonstration marked the inaugura
tion of the Republican Congressional
campaign in the Fourth and Fifth
districts, and Julius Kahn, candidate
in the Fourth, and E. A. Hayes, candi
date in the Fifth, had every reason to
believe when the meeting adjourned
that though the fight has just com
menced it has been won.
For the first time since the national
campaign opened"' the Alhambra was
crowded â every seat was occupied
and in the rear of the auditorium
stood an interested crowd. And it
was not only a big crowd, but it was
an enthusiastic crowd. The names of
Roosevelt and Fairbanks, or the name
of Kahn or Hayes were the signal for
a mighty shout of approval. For
Kahn and for Hayes there were
naught but cheers and commendation.
In the absence of General George
Stone, chairman of the Republican
State Central Committee, E. F. Wood
ward, secretary of the committee,
called the meeting to order. "Judging
from the large crowd present," said
Mr. Woodward, "the candidacy of E.
A. Hayes and Julius Kahn is safe and
victory will be theirs." He ,then intro
duced Colonel George H. Pippy as
chairman of the evening. Colonel
Pippy was greeted with cheers when
he rose to accept the offloe. Colonel
Plppy's address was short, but .to the
point. He said:
"It is a pleasure to look this audience
in the face and discuss the issues of the
coming Presidential campaign. Cali
fornia will show her appreciation of the
statesman, the soldier, who -placed love
of country and patriotism above ambi
tion for office â Theodore Roosevelt.'
"We have with us to-night a repre
sentative of Southern California and
the distinguished men- that are your
candidates for Congress. I shall close,
for . you are anxious to â¢ hear from
them."
Colonel Pippy's address was followed
by some excellent singing by the Stan
ford University Republican Quartet.
The songs concluded. Colonel Pippy in
troduced Frank P. Flint of Los An
geles. "Though Mr. Flint comes from
the south," % said Colonel Pippy, "his
speech will interest you the more when
you know that he spent his boyhood
days in this city." Mr. Flint, who was
extended a flattering reception by the
audience, said in part:
| "Mr.' Chairman, Ladies and Gentle
men and Fellow Republicans: We are
to-day the most prosperous nation on
earth, as a result of the Republican ad
ministration, not only in the past eight
years, but during the period of over
fifty years since the Inception . of the
Republican party. The reasons given
by Democrats why there should be a
change of administration are .chiefly
that some acts done, or about , to be
done by the Republican party are un r
constitutional. We have violated some
provision of the constitution! Another
reason Is the protective tariff system.
The people pf the nation have been
taxed! I believe the party is able to
answer the charges.

DISCUSSES' ISSUES.
Colonel Plppy said when Mr. Flint
had concluded his address that Mr.
Flint had made but one error. That
was when he intimated that Los Angeles
might roll up a bigger majority for the
Republicans in November than San
Francisco. "I carried the Republican
banner to Los Angeles," said Colonel
Plppy. "and I am sure that with the
effective work that Is being done .here
by the State Central Committee San
Francisco will roll up the largest Re
publican majority in the State. Then
I want to go and bring the banner back
again."
Mr. Pippy then introduced E. A.
Hayes, candidate for Congress in the
Fifth Congressional District. When the
applause that greeted Mr. Hayes sub
sided he said In part:
"Ladles and Gentlemen â One of the
first things I want to do is to ,thank
you heartily for your cordial greeting.

in an uncertain condition. The Repub

The testimony that was taken before
the^CS rand Jury in connection with! the
charges^asains^-th|^ecUorhboard.will
be transcribed /and' '"laid before the
Mayor. The evidence concerning the
personnel of the precinct officers in the
Almshouse district will be particularly
called to his /attention. The following
counts against the Commissioners, as
set forth by Foreman Lilienfeld in his
letter to Judge Lawlor, will also be
presented in the effort to convince the
Mayor that the commission has been
guilty of violation of law that calls for
immediate steps on his part:
"Firstâ Not one of the officers of this
precinct was on the assessment roll.
"Second â All the officers who served
in this precinct were of the same po
litical affiliation, arid so expressed
themselves in their applications for ap
pointment.
"Thirdâ Five of the six officers of this
precinct registered and voted in the
Seventy-third Precinct of the Thirty
ninth Assembly District.
"Fourthâ Three of the six election of
ficers who served in this precinct were
and are at present employes of the mu
nicipal government."
Judge Lawlor had arrived at no con
clusion yesterday as to the request from
a majority of the Grand Jury that he
instruct the District Attorney to pro
ceed against the Election Commission
for removal from office. Should he de
cide that he could not complyâ that the
law would not permit of such a course
â he would probably make secret com
munication of the fact to the foreman.
The grand jurors were given assur
ance yesterday that the District Attor
ney's office would without hesitation
take up the prosecution of the Com
missioners if asked to do so. If Judge
Lawlor does not see his way clear to
set the law in motion the jurors, will
therefore send the request directly to
District Attorney Byington.
The police have found no trace of the
whereabouts . of Adolph Steffens, who
was indicted for illegal voting In the
Seventy-third ; Precinct. He is believed
to be in hiding in the city or in some
adjoining county. . .
James F. Lawler and Ernest Adams
were accepted by Judge Sloss yesterday
morning as sureties on the bail bond of
Joseph Rebstock, the indicted precinct
Inspector, in the sum of $5000. Lawler's
business was given as that, of mer
chant arid his residence 18 Huron street,
Adams as a hotel-keeper, residing at 29
Eddy street.".
Foreman Lilienfeld of the Grand Jury
had a conference with a number of hia
colleagues yesterday, and It was de
cided to request Mayor Schmitz to sus
pend the Election Commissioners pend
ing prosecution for misfeasance.
It Is certain that the prosecution will
be instituted, if not by the District At
torney, as has been requested by the
Grand Jury, then by the Merchants'
Association, the board of directors of
which gave such instructions to its at
torneys on Friday. The jurors regard
the violation of law on the part ol the
Commissioners so flagrant that depri
vation of office, they think, should fol
low forthwith. . â¢

Continued on PagÂ© 23, Column 1*which we owe allegiance makes a man
unsafe, then perhaps these criticisms
are true. But when in the history of our
country have the American people been
so respected and honored in foreign
lands as they are to-day? When has the
country ever had the prestige abroad
that she enjoys at the present time?
For years American citizens have
"blushed to think that our compatriots
traveling in foreign, lands have fre
quently been compelled to appeal to the'
diplomatic representatives of foreign
governments for protection and sup
port. I have an abiding faith in the in
telligence of my countrymen. I remem
ber how the entire nation was stirred a
few years ago when Grover Cleveland
issued his pronunciamento regarding
the Venezuela boundary dispute. Our
countrymen want at the head of their
government a man who has the cour
age, the patriotism and the independ
ence that will say to all the world, "We
do not intend to meddle in your affairs,
but we do intend, at all hazards and
under all circumstances, to protect the
rights and the interests of the Ameri
can people.' That is true American doc
trine, and that is the doctrine which in
spires and actuates Theodore Roose
velt. ,
"Another Issue that seems to agitate
our political opponents considerably
during the present campaign is the
tariff. They denounce protectionism as
a 'robbery of the many to enrich the
few.' Ab my friend, 'Uncle Joe' Can
non, the present Speaker of the House
of Representatives, often remarked,
'talk Is cheap, but factB are stubborn
things.' Let me for a few minutes con
trast the conditions that prevailed in
this country under the last Democratic
administration and under the Republi
can administrations of the past seven
and a half years. In 1892, while the
country was in a highly prosperous
condition, the Democratic campaigners
and stump speakers succeeded in mak
ing a large proportion of our' country-'
men believe that they were being taxed
to death.
"The result was a complete Demo
cratic victory at the polls in that" year.-
Not only did they elect their candidate
for President, but the Senate and' the
House of Representatives were for the
first time since 1860 in complete control
of the triumphant Democracy. Mr.
Cleveland, with the Independence that
always characterized his 'official ac
tions, had sent at the close of his first
administration a message to Congress
strongly urging a decided reduction In

"Then like a transformation scene
In some magnificent spectacle, came
the four years of plenty under Wil
liam McKinley. Instead Of drawing
cut their hard-earned dollars, they be
gan again to make their deposits and
from July, 1887, to July, 1901. there
was an increase In the deposits In
these three banks of $21,977,774. Dur
ing the succeeding- three years and
one month, from July, 1901, to August,
Senate and House of Representatives
of his own political fjiith, the manu
facturers, ' realizing that the tariff
laws would now beâ¢alt6red, began to
curtail the production of their facto
ries and workshops. Men became Idle
and were : unemployed. 'With the
opening,. of the regular. session 'of Con
gress in -..1893 ; tariff tinkering began..
More mills and banked
their fires and closed their doors.' Af
ter mahy i months of wrangling and
contention the Wilson-Gorman tariff
bill was passed. It became a law
without the President's signature be
cause, in his opinion, it. did not go
far enough.
â "And then came Coxey's army and
the tramp of the unemployed rever
berated throughout the length and
breadth of the land. Samuel Gompers,
the head, of the American Federation
of Labor, gave it as his opinion that
3.000,000 of our fellow citizens were
out of work. Free souphouses had to
be established in every section of our
common country. The distress of our
people .was complete and thorough.
And then, in 189G, after as severe and
costly* an experiment as our. country
men had ever indulged in, they re
versed their actions of four years be
fore, the lamented William McKinley
-was elected by an overwhelming ma
jority and again the executive and
legislative branches of our Govern
ment came into the hands of the Re
publican party. Within a fortnight
after his Inauguration Presidenf Mc-
Kinley called the Congress of the
United States in extraordinary ses
sion for the purpose of framing a new
tariff law. Within a few months the
Dingley bill was written on the statute
books of the United States and in an
incredibly short space of time a wave
of prosperity swept over our country
that has never been equaled in this or
any other land or clime.
"During those four years of famine
how did the citizens of San Francisco
and. of the State of California fare?
And what has been their portion of
the marvelous era of plenty that we
enjoyed during the last seven and a
half years of bountiful abundance? I
have Â¦ here some official statistics
which were furnished me by J. Cal
Ewing, secretary of tHe Board of
Bank Commissioners of this State.
During the four years of Democratic
administration what with a tariff tin
kering: agitation and the Wilson-Gor
man tariff act in force there was a
decrease in the deposits of the three
largest savings banks in San Fran
cisco, to wit., the Hibernia, the Ger
man and the Han Francisco Savings
Union, of $4. 059,208. N6w the sav
ings banks represent the surplus Of
the money earned by the working peo
ple. And according to these figures
the" deposits dropped over $4,000,000
from what they were at the close of
â¢the administration of Benjamin Har
rison at the beginning of 1893. In
other words, the working people had
to draw upon the funds which they
had set apart for. a rainy day â and, in
verity, the proverbial rainy day came
with the advent of complete Demo
cratic administration in 1893.

Democracy denounces protection as the
robbery of the many for the benefit of
â¢he few. Further, they denounce the
action of the Republican party In ref
erence to the lands we have taken un
der our protection as being imperialis
tic and despotic. Now, when they say
that they mean that We have not ex
tended to the people of the Philippine
Islands all the same political rights
and privileges which we enjoy here.
they mean that we do not iet them
elect their Judges and chief officers, nor
send Senators aDd Representatives to
our Congressâ that, in short, we are
governing these people as colonies, and
that our government of them is tend
ing to the destruction of all the funda
mental principles upon which our Gov
ernment has been founded. Now, there
is nothing in all this. It is merely the
veriest political buncombe. To show
this we do not have to go farther than
to our own earliest and most funda
mental laws.
PHILIPPIXE QUESTION.
"When Thoma* Jefferson waa Presi
dent, a pretty good Democrat, or at
least bo usually regarded, we made the
Louisiana purchase. And did the
fathers extend the constitution, that
is, In the sense our Democratic friends
would have It extended In the Philip
pines, over that great territory? No.
The CongrhBs and President Inaugu
rated stich a government as in their
wisdom they thought best and most
serviceable to the people.
"I am not one of those who Is will
ing to see the American flag pulled
down any place when it has once been
put up. I want it to stay there.
Especially in the Philippine Islands.
Don't let us run away from our na
tional destiny. I would be ashamed
to see -us falter in the course which
Providence and our own future as well
as a regard for these people who have
been placed under our care has
marked out for us. I believe that the
time will come when these Filipinos
will thank God for the blessing which
our American Government has
brought to them. In that day those
islanders will be ready to fight for
our flag just as we are ready to fight
for it, because they will have learned
to love it.
"See what an opportunity is offered
to the American people in the Orient.
A trade, the richest in the world,
which reaches up into the hundreds
of milllops and which will some day
prow into billions of dollars, is waiting
for us to rÂ«Â»Hch across this Pacific
Ocean of ours and to take jt. Our
PaHRc Ocean, for I believe that we
<an claim it as our sea. and in the
future will make good the claim, let us
reach across this ocean and take up
this trade, which is going to surpass
nnything the world bias ever known.
TALKS 1OF PROTECTION*.
"Now T am going: to talk about an
other subject, one that will make you
fpe.1 tired as soon as I mention it, for
Jti various phases have been more
thrashed over in the last generation of
American politics than anything else.
But I cannot pass it by to-night, for if
there is one thing that is the core of
Jlepublicanism more than another it
is protection. The Democrats de
r.f unce protection as the robbery of
the many for the benefit of the few.
Let us look at this matter plainly for
a little while. Manufacturers have to
pay more for their labor in this coun
try than they do in any other. Now
peme of these manufacturers may Bay
that if labor here were on the same
plane as in European countries. Great
Britain. Germany and the rest, they
could sweep the markets of the world.
Now I am going to give you some
homely Illustrations of the way our
protection laws work. These laws

"In the present campaign, among the
leading issues raised by the other side
are the personal characteristics of our
standard-bearer, Theodore Roosevelt.
We are told, in the first place, that he
overrides that great palladium of our
liberties, the constitution of the United
States. How the Democratic orators
love that word 'palladium,' For years
they have fondled It and toyed with it,
and written it into their party plat
forms â because, I suppose,- it sounds
well. But when they charge the pres
ent President of the United States
(and, by the grace of the people of the
United States, the President-to-be for
four -years more, after the fourth day
of next March)' with usurping powers
not gran tefl by the constitution, they
not only misrepresent the facts, but
they F.how a woeful lack of knowledge
of; the history of the administration of
tho father of the Democratic party.
Th'Wtias Jefferson. For, If the annals
of our country have been writ true, it
is there that when Jefferson, through
his Commissioners to France, accom
plished the purchase of the Louisiana
Territory, he openly and publicly ad
mitted that there was no warrant In
the constitution for his action in con
summating the'treaty of purchase, and
he gave It as his honest opinion that a
constitutional amendment would have
to be adopted In order that the pur
chase might be properly and constitu
tionally confirmed and ratified. But
to this day the constitution has never
been amended in that regard, and If
Theodore Roosevelt has at any time
ridden rough-shod over the constitu
tion of the United States, as our politi
cal opponents would have us believe â
a propostion, however, which I em
phatically denyâ then he simply has
marched hand in hand with that other
great violator of the constitution,
Thomas Jefferson. And, fellow-citl-
I zens, I am patriotic enough to accord
to Thomas Jefferson all the honor that
Is due him as a great, loyal, fearless
and undaunted patriot and statesman.
i DEFENDS ROOSEVELT.
"For the tfme being a candidate sim

party. The man, in the course of years,
dies and passes on. The principles of
his party, however, still live and con
tinue to live until new conditions arise
that create new principles.
"I have always contended that in a
political campaign a candidate can af
ford to b<? perfectly fair and honest and

is only natural. And yet we should be

air. Kahn accepted the novel presen
tation of his name to the audience and
immediately took his place at the
speaker's stand. A great cheer went
up and it was several minutes before
the Republican candidate for Congress
could proceed with his address. When
quiet was restored he said in part:
"It is my intention this evening to
endeavor to give you a few reasons
why the people of the State of Cali
fornia should continue to stand loyal
to the principles advocated by the Re
publican party, and in doing so it is
my lirm determination not to descend
to vituperation and personal attacks.
I strongly deprecate, and in fact I have
always deprecated and condemned,
such tactics, and I desire at this time
to beg my friends not to tolerate that
kind of politics.
"They have made out a programme
for me, but there is one part I am go
ing to omit. I do not believe that Jul
ius Kahn needs an Introduction to a
San Francisco audience."

speech Colonel Pippy said: "There,

"You bet he's all right." came from

"Just one word more as to my own
position here to-night By this time
I suppose you have discovered that I
am a Republican, and If I am elected
on the 8th of next November I shall
stand by and help to carry out the
national policies of the Republican
party. At the same time I want you
to remember that I was nominated not
at my own solicitation, and that I
will go to CongTess if the people of
this district elect me with pledges to
nobody except to do my duty by my
constituents, Republicans, Democrats
or Union Labor. If I go there, my
friends, I shall strive to so conduct
myself that I can have the approval

Springfield, Mass., or any place else

"There is another way American la
bor is threatened in this country, espe
cially jn this western part of it. I be
lieve in the exclusion of Mongolian la
bor from it. And I want to say right
here that I have always carried out
this doctrine In my own business and
always will. As long as there is a white
man for the work I do not think him a
true American - who would employ a
Chinaman to do that work. But even
more; by destroying protection of
American industries we would be doing
just that very thing. It Is just as
wrong to employ Chinamen in China to
do the work which Americans should
be doing- in America as it- would be to
bring the Chinamen here to do it.
What kind of a man is he who would
turn aside a fellow American who says,
'I must have $1 60 or $2 a day to sup
port my family,' simply, because a Chi
naman offered to do the same work for
70 or 80 cents? And. I can assure you
that I would never come before an as
sembly of American workers and ask
them for their suffrages if I had ever
done such a thing. I would be ashamed
to look an honest American working
man in the face.

TRIiLlTMEXT OF PILES.
Permanence of Cure the True Test.
Many so-called pile remedies will af-
ford the user slight temporary relief,
and the majority of those afflicted do
not expect more than this.
The average sufferer, after having
tried every preparation recommended
for the cure of piles, comes to the con-
clusion that there Is no cure except by
an operation, and rather than undergo
this "last resort" he suffers on, re-
signed to the situation, so far as may
be. The attention of those interested
!e invited to the following experience:
"After ten years of suffering from
blind, bleedine and protruding piles,
and after using every remedy I could
hear of without any benefit. I finally
bought a fifty cent box of Pyramid
Pile Cure and used it with such good
results I bought next a dollar box,
which finished ud the Job. That was
nearly six years ago. and as far as
piles Is concerned I am cured and have
never felt a symptom of them since.
"Many others have used this remedy
by my advice, with the same results,
and I always recommend It to sufferers
with piles."
C. H. POTTS. Burlington. Kans.
Testimony like this should convince
the most skeptical that Pyramid Pile
Cure not only cures, but cures to stay
cured. It is in the form of a sup-
pository, can be applied in the privacy
of the home, directly to the parts af-
fected, asd does its work quickly and
painlessly.
Druggists generally Bell this famous
remedy for fifty cents a package and
6ufferers are urged to buy a package
now" and give it a trial to-night. Ac-
cept no substitutes.
A little book describing the causes
and cure of piles is published by the
Pyramid Drug Co., Marshall, Mich.,
and the same will be sent free to any |
address for the asking.

You saw from the set of his jaw that
he is brave. You saw from the tilt
of his chin that he is determined. You
recognized in, the tones of his voice
that he is sincere. You saw in the
set of his shoulders and the swine of
his body that he. is independent You
gathered from what he said that he is
a man, a gentleman and a true Ameri
can, full to^the overflowing with love
of country and his countrymen, and it
requires no clairvoyant, no mind
reader, to tell you that he means what
he says."

crease during the seven years of Re
publican adminstration of $42,763,757.
And that similar conditions have pre
vailed In every section of our State,
during the period referred to, let me
give you some more figures. In 1893,
at the commencement of the time
when the Democratic administration
was in complete control of all of the
machinery of the Government, the to
tal deposits in the savings banks of
this State amounted to $138,019,874.
In four years they,fell to $127,929,281,
a decrease of $10,090,593. The assets
of these savings banks also fell from
$153,127,972 in 1893. to $143,456,177
in 1897, a decrease of $9,671,795.
"Under Republican administration,
the deposits rose from $127,929,281 in
1S97 to $156,167,461 in 1900, and from
$156,167,461 in 1900 to $224,769,058
in 1904, a grand total increase of $96,
839,777. The assets of these banks
have increased from $143,456,177 . in
1897, to $173,872,499 in 1900, and
from $173,872,499 in 1900 to $246,326,

of $102,870,811 during the Republi

NEW YORK, Oct. 15.â The Financier
sayg: The official statement of the New

a verv encouraging exhibit. Though
the c&Fh gain was much below the esti

BANK RESERVE
SHOWS A GAIN
thereby counting for only about $3,000,
000 In the averages, the receipts of cash
from other sources were continuous,
and they should naturally have been
reflected in the statement. It is possi
ble, however, that there were unre
corded losses of cash through transfer
of excess internal revenue collections,
which would account for the greater
part of the discrepancy. The deposits
were decreased $12,088,300, causing a re
duction In the reserve requirements by
$3,009,575. which sum added to the gain
In cash made $3,360,975 as the increase
in the surplus reserve to $15,957,875,
against $17,431,250 a year ago and $.5,
008,250 at the corresponding date in
1902. Computed upon the basis of de
posits, less those of $23,262,700 public
funds, the surplus is now $21,773,550.
In view of the somewhat buoyant spec
ulation on the Stock Exchange and the
negotiations of large amounts of rail
road mortgages, the contract ofjll,
975.S00 in loans may be regarded as re
markable. Tt would seem to show that
Stock Kxchanpe requirements did not
tend greatly to augment borrowing , by
commission houses, and that liquida
tion of loans, as the result of the pre
vious week's unfavorable bank state
ment, much more tha.n offset new loans
for bond negotiations. It may be noted,
that the loan expansion since August
27 now amounts to $34,956,200, : the net
cash lofs since August 20 to $46^738,400
and the net reduction in the'Vurplus re

week, the decrease in deposits, result-
Ing from contraction In loans, was so
great as to cause an Important gain in
the surplus reserve. It seems surpris
ing when the fact is considered that the
estimates showed that the banks had
gained heavily of cash, chiefly through
the receipts of Australian and Japanese
gold and- of domestic bullion. amÂ§unt
ing to $5,379,560. while the net loss on
the interbankment was much m.orÂ«
than offset by a gain by the banks from
the sub-treasury, that the increase In
cash as officially reported should have
been only $311,400. Though the Austra
lian gold was not transferred hither
from San Francisco until Thursday,
alone admired by the people of hlg own
country, but by the people of the world.
No President of these United States has
ever attracted the attention of the peo
ple of the world generally and gained
their admiration and esteem more than
has Theodore Roosevelt. He is dis
tinctively-a man from the people, and
by training and association has emi
nently fitted himself for the position
which he now holda and to which the
people will re-elect him on the 8th day
of next November."
Hon. John F. Davis followed In a
masterful address. He was born and
spent his early youth in Marin Coun
ty and was soon at home with his
audience. He first said a good word
for Mr. Olmsted, the candidate for
the Assembly, and then paid a glowing
tribute to the- faithfulness and ruggad
.honesty, .of his friend, Senator Bel
'<hkw.
He explained at length how the
present unwieldy size of the House of
Representatives "has compelled the
adoption of a working plan under
which the form and even the text of
all Important bills is determined in
the caucus of the predominant party
and how a constituency is handicapped
unless it is represented by one who
can on account of his affiliation with
the party in power go into such a
caucus and there take part in the
formation of the bill itself. He showed
how of late years diligent Democratic
members have been reduced to ap
pealing: to United States" Senators to
tack their amendments, when accept
able to the majority, on to the bill in
the Senate, and thus accomplishing
what little they can: that if in the
future the .membership of the House
shall be reduced to something like its
former size, -then the House can re
sume its mission aa a deliberative
body, and minority members ag.Â»in
have some Influence In debate on the
floor, but until that time a minority
member on the floor is simply a voice
crying in the wilderness, for the de
liberation takes place in the caucus,
and the vote on the floor Is a ratifica
tion of the caucus deliberation.
"If you are a non-partisan, there
fore, but believe that this administra
tion has done so well that 'the Re
publicans will control the next House,
then you should vote for a Republi
can In Congress, for he can be present
in person at the political council board
and more effectively help shape leg
islation in favor of your local inter
ests than the most brilliant Demo
crat. â¢ who may not enter. If you are
a Republican and believe in the main
tenance of the principles and policies
of your party, and" in sustaining the
hands of your President, then It is
political idiocy to vote for any Demo
crat for Representative, no matter
how able, for if the Democrats gain
control of the House,' they can, under
the present system, clog and block the
wheels of every beneficent policy con
."The argument on national matters
was a straightforward discussion of
policies and events, and the appeal
was not to Republicans, but was ad
dressed to those Democrats who had
voted. for McKinley on the one hand,
and'Ho those Democrats who had fol
lowed Bryan and still believed that his
policies are right on the other.
"Why has this campaign thus far
been so quiet? Simply because the
Democrats have been unable to agree
among themselves upon anything that
1 can be given the semblance of an Is*
sue. Those things that could be made
an issue they cannot agree upon, and
the few things upon which they can
agree cannot be tortured Into an la-'
1 sue. That Is the uncontrovertible fact.
Roosevelt and 'his party are. of one
mindâ they agree â they represent 1 a
definite- policy upon everything. On
the main questions that can arise
Parker and his party are not in ac
cord. The Â» Democratic party is, -for
example, rent in twain on the all-Im
portant question of finance. :~^V .

Kinley on' account of your. opinions on

Special Dispatch td The Call.
9AUSALITO, Oct. 16. â The largest
and' most enthusiastic Republican
mass-meeting "of the campaign was
held. here to-night in honor of Charles
M. Belshaw; Republican candidate for
re-election for joint Senator from
Marin and Contra Costa counties. The
Sausalito band met Mr. Belshaw at
the depot and escorted him to the hall,
where a vast audience awaited him,
and when he took his seat upon the
platform he was heartily cheered.
W. J. Martin, chairman of the even
ing, called the meeting to order and
In a few well chosen words introduced
Mr. Belshaw, who spoke In part as
follows:
"The present campaign Is not ma
terially different from that of four
years ago, and I am constrained to be
lieve that the result will be the same.
"The trials and Hardships of '93.
'94 and '95 should still be fresh in the
minds of all and I do not believe there
is any desire on the part of our citi
zens to return to them. We cannot
afford to' retrograde. We are too well
satisfied with progress and prosperity.
And Oils we have had in the fullest
measure during the last eight .years
Tinder Republican administration.
Protection to American labor and
American industry is still our watch
word and under its beneficent 1 influ
ence we shall continue to build up and
strengthen our nation. 'A fair day's
pay and a chance to earn It' is still
guaranteed by the policies of the Re
publican party. The home market Is
that for which we contend and we
shall not surrender it to foreign na
tions by a reckless reduction of our
protective tariff. History tells us that
since the establishment of our Govern
ment our years of progress and pros
perity have been under the influences
of protective tariffs; tariffs enacted for
the purpose of protecting our laboring
men against the pauper wages of for
eign countries. History also tells ua
that all of our periods of depression
and hard times have been during
those years when the tariff was on the
'revenue, only' basis, or at least it was
not constructed with the idea of pro
tecting our Industries and laborers.
Our Democratic friends have de
nounced our present tariff as 'rob
bery.': . They assert that on account of
the higl, tariff the people are com
pelled to pay too much for what they
must buy; that a reduction of the
tariff would 'bring about a much
riee'ded" reduction in the price of com
modities and that, the people would
therefore be the gainers.
"It is, a much better state of affairs"
to have prices high and money to buy
with than to have prices cheap and no
money. High prices and high wages
are the best evidences of general pros
perity, and general prosperity Is the
best indication of the welfare of a
country and its people. The prosperity
of our United Stales and the general
condition of our people surpass that of
any nation on earth. The necessities
of our laboring: men would be consid
ered luxuries by the laboring people of
other lands. And the many luxuries
which afe enjoyed by our laborers are
often not had by the upper and middle
classes of Europe. Our universal con
dition of plenty is the direct result of
the protective policy of the Republican
party. Our people are aware of thiB;
they are satisfied with their condition,
and I don't believe they are going to
vote against the party whose policies
and administration have made life so
pleasant and enjoyable for them.
"Theodore Roosevelt stands to-day
the foremost of Americans. His sturdy
character and perfect manhood are not
predatlon of Its vital importance and
finding they could not agree, the pro
moters of the candidacy of their even
tual nominee, realizing they were in a
hopeless minority, stuck their heads in
the sand, and. leaving all else of their
anatomy exposed, "in desperation re
solved that there was no issue on the
subject at allâ the majority of the com
mittee, with the j mental reservation
that free silver was simply in abeyance
on account of a temporary increase In
the physical production of gold, and the
minority with the mental reservation
that the gold standard was 'irrevocably
fixed.' The gentleman who placed their
candidate in nomination, answering the
taunts that the views of his candidate
were unknown on the financial ques
tion, and that he had given no sign,
boldly proclaimed that 'strategy is not
sin.' Let us assume that it Is not sin.
"The fact that it was us*d at all
showed its necessity, and its. necessity
conclusively disclosed the fact of the
irreconcilable conflict of opinion on a
great, all-important public question.
The subsequent telegram was predi
cated upon an open acknowledgment
of the existence of this fact. That In
tense situation still exists. The mere
declaration of men in the desperation
of physical exhaustion that it does not
exist amounts to nothing. Judge Park
er states in his letter of acceptance
that 'he believes' the gold standard is
'irrevocably fixed,' and the next day
Mr. Bryan 'has nothing to take back.*
Senator Newlands at the Alhambra
Theater in San Francisco proclaims
that 'free silver Is simply in abeyance.'
and Mr. Tobin of the Hibernla ,Bank,
chairman of the meeting, suddenly
stops applauding and looks In a pained
way toward 'the faces of those whom In
late years we have not had the pleasure
of seeing with us.' It's not funny. It's
as serious to you now as it was to those
desperate debaters In the committee on
resolutions. Suppose Mr. Parker should
be elected and there should come dur
ing his term a temporary money strin
gency from any cause; the whole con
troversy of that committee-room would
be precipitated upon us In a moment,
with all Its old-time fury. Would Park
er then be true, or would he, in the
face of a militant majority of his party,
again weakly believe that 'strategy Is
not sin'?"
Other speaker? were S. H. Olmatead,
candidate for the Assembly, and L. C.

\ CATARRH OF THE STOMACH.
A Pleasant, Simple, but Safe and
... .Effectual Cure for It.
! I .Catarrh at the stomach has long been
considered the next thing to incurable.
The usual symptoms are a""full or bloat-
ing sensation after eating, accompanied
sometimes with sour or watery risings,
a formation of gases, causing pressure
on the heart and lungs and difficult
breathing, headaches, fickle appetite,
nervousness and a general played out,
languid feeling.
There is often a foul' taste in th$;
mc/uth, coafed tongue and if the interior
of the stomach could be Been it would
show a glimy, Inflamed condition. â¢
â¢The cure for this common and ob-
stinate trouble is found in a treatment
which causes the food to ] be readily,
thoroughly digested before it has time
to ferment" and Irritate the delicate
mucous surfaces of the stomach. To
secure a prdmpt and healthy digestion
is the one necessary thing to do and
when normal digestion is secured the
catarrhal condition will have disap-
peared. '
According to Dr. Harlanson the saf-
est and best treatment is to use after
each meal a tablet composed of DlaB-
taee, Aseptic Pepsin, a little Nux, Gold-
en Seal and fruit acids. These tablets
can now be found at all drug stores
under the name of Stuart's Dyspepsia
Tablets, and nof being a patent medi-
cine can be used, with perfect safety
and, assurance that, healthy appetite
and thorough digestion wilt follow their
regular use after meals. . ;
Mr. R. S. Workman, Chicago, 111.,
writes: "Catarrh is a local condition
resulting from a neglected cold in the
head, .whereby the lining membrane
of the nose becomes inflamed and the
poisonous discharge therefrom passing
backward into the throat reaches the
stomach, this producing catarrh of the
stomach. Medical authorities prescrib-
ed for ; me for three years for catarrh
of stomach without Â¦ cure,- but to-day
I am the happiest of men after using
only one box of- Stuart'n Dyspepsia
Tablets. I cannot find appropriate
Â¦words â¢ to â¢ express my good feeling. I
have found flesh, appetite and sound
:rest from their tÂ»e.i'<v -
Stuart's Dyspepsia'Tablets is the saf-
est preparation as well as the simplest
and most convenient remedy for any
form of indigestion, Catarrh of stem-,
ach,. biliousness, ' sour stomach, heart-'
burn and bloating after meals. . '

"Here we have the issue clearly de
fined. The Republican party stands
for the subjugation of defenseless for
eign peoples; Democracy stands for
freedom. We relieved Spain of this
"Permit me to call your attention
to the portion of the Democratic plat
form relating to it:
" 'No Government has the right to
make one set of laws for those
at home and a different set of laws,
absolute in their character, for those
In the colonies. Wherever there may
exist a people incapable of being gov
erned under American laws, in con
sonance with the Constitution, the ter
ritory of that people ought not to be
part of the American domain. We
insist that we ought to do for the
Filipinos what we have done already
for the Cubans, and that it is our
duty to make that promise now, and
upon suitable guarantees of protection
to citizens of our own and other
countries resident there at the time
of our withdrawal to set the Filipino
people upon their feet, free and inde
pendent, free to work out their own
destiny.'
"The Declaration of Independence,
born in the brain of the fathers of De
mocracy, says the same thing in effect,
for it declares that governments derive
their "just powers from the consent of
the governed.'
"I have before said that we may not
disregard the responsibility imposed by
possession of the Philippines, and that
'responsibility will be best subserved by
preparing the islanders as rapidly as
possible for self-government and giving
to them the assurance that it will come
as soon as they are reasonably prepared
for it.'
"This means independence for the
Filipinos in the fullest sense of the
word. When prepared they may gov
ern themselves, as the Cubans do, un
assisted unless asking help.undirected
unlesss asking advice, untrammeled by
our politics, unincumbered by our poli
ticians and uncontrolled by us.
"Secretary Taft has said: *A
promise to give ultimate independence
will be construed by the more violent
element, disposed to agitation, to be
a promise to grant independence in
the near future and during the pres
ent generation. The success of the
experiment we are making in the
Philippines depends on having the
Filipinos understand that we are there
for their benefit, but that we expect
to stay there indefinitely in working
out the good we propose to do them.'
ROSEMOUNT, Esopus, N. T. t Oct.
15. â Judge Parker to-day addressed
two visiting delegations on the politi
cal issues, making his second speech
of the campaign since accepting the
Democratic nomination for the Presi
dency. Speaking of the Philippine is-
Eue, he said:
thorn in her flesh, the Philippines, to
plunge it into our own. We paid, and
are paying, enormously for the privi
lege of performing: the operation.
"Spain had been trying to conquer
the islands since the early decades of
the sixteenth century. She had never
quite succeeded. That is not surpris
ing. Every true American would de
spise a man who would not fight to
the last gasp for the land of his fire
side and the birthplace of his babes.
Did not our illustrious ancestors in
the revolution do so? For what does
civilized man revere the memory of
Washington? Are not the Irish still
chafing under the English yoke? Will
the Boer sympathizer refuse his sym
pathy to the Filipino patriot defend
ing his hearthstone? Do we not hon
or every man who has sacrificed at
freedom's holy altar?"

Frank Kahles, foreman of the Crock

one of the most expert lemon growers
in Southern California, Is at the St.

wife. Mr. Kahles has been honored
with the chairmanship of the Santa

Santa Barbara has shown her enter
prise by providing in her tax levy for
$3000 to transport her St. , Louis ex
hibit to the Portland (Or) Exposition
and ma>rÂ»fl<n it there. That county
hÂ«g a very pretty display here and its
possession will greatly lessen Santa
Barbara's expense for exhibition at the
Portland show. C. W. Merritt, the
Santa Barbara commissioner, who has
been very successful in his work here.
will probably be retained to take charge
at Portland.
CALL BUREAU, WORLD'S FAIR,
RT. LOUIS, Oct. 15.â "When you see a
bunch of farmers anywhere in thesa
Eastern States that are dissatisfied and
would like to try a more congenial
clime. Just take your stereopticon and
give them about three doses of grapes
and oranges and alfalfa, and then
point to the nearest railroad station."
The speaker was Captain Will Har
ris of the Kings County exhibit, who
has Just sent fifteen families from a
district in Iowa to his county. He did
it all with his little stereopticon.
"They may talk about the adz and
the brewery being in the lead of civili
zation's onward march," said Harris,
"but it's the Etereopticonâ that* a the
thing. The long-barreled rifle and the
coonskin cap have had their day. If
Daniel Boone and General Fremont had
been expert with the lantern the wild
turkey would have been crowded off
the roost on the run.
"Over there in Iowa when I threw
Fresno oranges on the screen the chil
dren tried to grab them. Th^e farmers
who had been trying to make corn pro
duce heavily enough to head off the
mortgage gazed on a few alfalfa ranges
and a township or two of drying fruit,
and began figuring how much they
could clean up en their farms by train
time the next night. If anybody hesi
tates turn on the lantern slides.
Enough energetic men working with
Etereopt icons could depopulate the East
and fill California until the settlers
dropped off Into the eea.
"Seriously, tbe Etereopticon is the
best advertising medium outside of a
permanent exhibit. The Eastern farmer
may hear plenty of stories, and true
ones, about the marvels of agriculture
in California and not be particularly
Impressed, but you give him vistas of
growing alfalfa, fruit orchards, vine
yards and dairy scenes, such as may
be seen from one end of California to
the other, and be wants to sell out and
go there. The interest the farmers
take In stereoptioon pictures showing
the wonders of California Is intense.
Tou can carry a etereoptlcon to a
farmer, but not a world's fair."

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL', SUNDAY, OCTOBER 16, 1901
ANOTHER GRANT* PRIZE WOX.
ST. LOUIS, Oct. 15.â A 300-pound
cube of peat soil from Rough and
Ready Island, below Stockton, has
been awarded a erand prize. This
cube is representative of the Delta
lands, near Stockton and Sacramento.
The Jury was composed mostly of
Europeans, who expressed wonder at
the richness of the flberous cube of
soil, and the award Is a splendid tes
timonial to those Delta lands and to
the State of California. It is generally
conceded here that Holland has no
better soil.
The most seriously injured are: Mrs.
F. H. Cunningham, Texas Creek, Colo.,
severe bruises and probable internal in
juries; George Bossinger, engineer of
passenger train, arm and leg broken
and badly bruised; O. M. Smith, fire
man of freight, rib broken; Carl Pit
cock, fireman of passenger, badly hurt;
G. L. Banks, train porter, badly hurt;
A. G. Moulton, conductor of passenger
train, cut about the head; C. E. Evans,
express messenger, injured about body;
D. H. Hawley, passenger, reported bad
ly hurt; Pearl Casley and W; H. Conk
ling, mail clerks; J. W. Webster, Pu
eblo, passenger, legs badly hurt.
The accident was due to the failure
of the freight train, which was late, to
take the siding at Portland and allow
the passenger train, which was running
on schedule time and had the right of
way, to pass. Both locomotives were
completely wrecked, the baggage and
express cars were telescoped and piled
up in a heap, the forward end of the
day coach was smashed and five freight
cars loaded with merchandise were de
molished. The Pullman cars were not
damaged.
The passenger train was running
about thirty-five miles and the freight
twenty miles an hour when the colli
sion occurred. The impact of the en
gines was terrific. Great confusion fol
lowed the collision, and exaggerated re
ports regarding the disaster were circu
lated.
PUEBLO, Colo., Oct. 15.â Fifteen
were injured, two of them perhaps fa
tally, in a head-on collision to-day be
tween the east-bound California limit
ed passenger train No. 6 and a west
bound freight train on the Denver and
Rio Grande Railroad a mile and a half
west of Portland.
DENIES RUMOR
OF WITHDRAWAL
Hermann Schussler, engineer of the
Spring Valley Company, denied em
phatically last evening a rumor that he
is to resign his position with the com
pany. He has not had the slightest In
tention of doing so. The story, he said,
would please people in the City Hall
if it were true, but there was absolutely
no foundation for it. The directors of
the company some time ago asked him
if he would continue to serve the cor
poration. He then said that he would.
It is true, Mr. Schussler says, that
he will go to Europe as soon as possi
ble after the decision in the suit the
Spring Valley Company has against
the city of San Francisco.
"I have been forty years in the ser
vice of the company," said Mr. Schuss
ler. "A week ago the directors gave a
dinner in my honor. To-night I am
going to give a dinner to forty of the
employes of the company as a token
of continued good will and of apprecia
tion of their services. On my return
from Europe I will again serve the
company if my health permits. Poor
health alone can prevent me from again
taking up the work."
Concerning the water company's suit
against the city, Mr. Schussler said
that he told the directors three years
ago that he would never appear again
to testify about water rates before the
Supervisors, but that he would willing
ly testify before a court.
Special Dispatch to ThÂ« Call.
ST. PAUL., Minn., Oct. 15. â To Va
ccine the victim of hay fever and to
recover from It within an hour -was
the. unique experience of six local phy.
sician3 at the hands of Dr. William
Dunbar, director of the hygienic in
stitute at Hamburg, Germany, at tha
lecture s!ven by him before the Ram
sey Courty Medical Society Â¦ at thÂ»
Commercial Club this week. Dr. Dun
bar Is the discoverer of the tru*
source of hay fever, the albumen snb-.
stance in the pollen of grains and
flowers, and the antl-toxln ,-wh!c!j
cures it. He had with him sevanl
vials of the toxin secured from ;hÂ«
pollen of wheat, golden rod and rag
weed, which induces genuine eases cl
hay fever within a few mom*nts Â»f,
tor dropping in the eye. Ha also ha4
with him vials of the antl-toxla whtca
cures the disease.
After the close of th* lactara Dr,
Dunbar called for volunteers on whoa,
to demonstrate the power of these ao-.
lutions. Drs. Schweitzer, Rents, Sneve,
Taylor, Berrynler and Odendahl casts
forward and allowed themselves to ba
subjected to the action of the toada
solution, the strength of which can bÂ«
estimated when it is stated that fif
teen parts of the toxin dissolved, la
1,000,000 parts of water could Indue*
hay fever In 5,000,000 peopla.
After the toxin had been applied 4
few minutes were allowed to â¢lapaa,
when hay fever became apparent
through sneezing and blocking of ths
nasal passages. The anti-toxin was
then applied and the progress of ths
disease stopped.
Dr. Dunbar Is an American and was
born in St. Paul. He studied medi
cine in Germany and twelve years ago
became director of the institute, which
he has built up to be the largest of its
kind in the world. It is a Government
Institution.

Evelyn Munson, 17 years of age and
very pretty, unfolded a rather ro
mantic bit of autobiography yester
day ere Police Judge Cabaniss sent her
to the Superior Court for trial on the
charge of having robbed Nels Carlson
of about $400 cash and several valu
able nuggets.
' She was parentless when a well
known Los Angeles attorney adopted
her. she averred, but .the comfortable
hpme, good education and Christian
training which he was giving her did
not provide sufficient excitement, so
she ran away to Mexico, donned cow
boy garb and became a cattle puncher.
When the novelty of the vocation
lapsed and Its hardships began Â£o pall
she decided to return to feminine ap
parel and civilization, and soon after
ward found herself in proper attire
and wondering where she would go
when she ventured forth from the
Ferry Station, San Francisco. It was
then she first met Nels Carlson. He
courteously asked her, in mutilated
English, If she would like to accom
pany him to the Chutes, incidentally
adding that he, too, was a stranger in
the great city and yearning for con
genial companionship. The protracted
deprivation of masculine notice to
which the girl had been subjected by
reason of her vaquero costume made
Mr. Carlson's society all the more en
gaging, and his invitation was accept
ed oh the spot. Together they went to
the Chutes, and together they e'njoyed
all the vehicles of popular recreation
there provided. When they returned
to town, the purse of Mr. Carlson, con
taining the double-eagles and the un
minted gold, was slyly stolen from his
pocket by the girl.
She fled with her plunder to Santa
Cruz, but was arrested and brought
back. Confessing her crime, she de
clared that faintness overcame her
when she opened the purse and saw
what it contained, as she had imagined
that it held only a few silver dollars.
However, instead of returning the gold
to Mr. Carlson she spent all except
$190 of the coin for clothing and gew
gaws. If she had not been penniless
and a stranger in town, she pleaded,
nothing could have induced her to be
Mr. Carlson's companion long enough
to find opportunity to rob him, as his
manners did not improve with ac
quaintance. His was a nature of coarse
fiber, she declared, and innate refine
ment such as she possessed could not
be sufficiently compensated pecuniarily
for enduring his general uncouthness
one entire evening. He told her he
had amassed vast wealth in the Klon
dike, and invited her to go there with
him, promising that he would soon
make her independently rich. Before
she had time to give the proposal a
moment's consideration he robbed it of
charm by adding that any good-look
ing and ordinarily bright young wom
an could hardly avoid making a for
tune in the underworld of Yukon so
ciety.
Mr. Carlson informed the court that
while he had relished Miss Munson's
company, he did not think it was
worth what It ultimately cost him.
"Ay ban hav goad time," he elucidat
ed, "bot ay pay toe moch foar at."
The girl's bail was fixed at $1000,
and she was unable to furnish it.
NEW YORK, Oct. 15.â The excited
manner of the speculation which ap
peared in the stock market yesterday,
marking the throwing off of the re
straint which held the market in check
during the earlier part of the week,
continued to-day. Buying orders for all
securities poured in in great volume
and from many sources. In the prin
cipal active stocks enormous blocks fre
quently changed hands, marking the
concentrated character of the opera
tions in them. This waa especially true
of United States Steel preferred, Penn
sylvania, Southern Pacific and Louis
ville and Nashville. The opening in
United States Steel preferred was of
10,000 shares sold simultaneously at
variations of % in price. The accom
panying large operations in Pennsylva
nia and in Southern Pacific were at
tributed to the revived interest in the
market of a veteran operator who
made a favorite of those stocks In pre
vious movements and who was intrust
ed with the management of the flota
tion of the United States Steel securi
ties. Louisville and Nashville became
very feverish in the final dealings,
rushing up to 137 by half-point jumps
and relapsing by the same intervals to
135H. The churning up of this stock oc
casioned a belief of revived operations
in the stock under the auspices which
resulted in the passing of control.
That there was enormous profit tak
ing, conducted parallel in the advances
in special stocks, was very obvious, not
only in the uneven manner of the rise,
but in the actual reactionary tendency
at some points, notably among other
specialties which came into ne^7 prom
inence during the week. The bank
statement showed only a small part in
the expected cash gain. The market
closed excited but somewhat Irregular.
Total sales of bonds, par value, 53,
925,000.
A broad and active market has pre
vailed during the week for all varieties
of securities, and the average tendency
has been upward through the opposi
tion of some very heavy selling of
stocks to realize profits on the rise.
Speculation has shifted from one to an
other quarter of the list, the low-priced
industrials coming in for an unusual
share of attention as the week pro
gressed. The foundation of the market
was the practical making of the grain
crops, the continued promise of an un
usually large cotton crop and the con
tinued ease of money, in spite of the
large withdrawal of currency for the
interior.
The Government's estimate of the
condition of corn on October 1 is
usually accepted in the trade an a
definite basis for estimating the final
yield for the crop, as the portion re
maining unharvested and liable to
damage from frost is then so much re
duced as to offer small danger of se
riously diminishing the final output.
An indicated crop on the Govern
ment's estimate of 2,245.000,000 bushels,
or upward, leaves no ground for alarm
that were caused by the early expert es
timates of the 2,000,000,000 bushels- or
less, and the improvement during Sep
tember of the spring wheat promises an
additon ito the exportable surplus of
that cereal. The effect of this news
was directly stimulating upon all the
grangers and directly upon the whole
market. The continued inroads on the
surplus reserves of the banks and the
prospect of its continuance yet for sev
eral j weeks caused a momentary hard
ening of money rates early in the week.
There was, besides, a receipt of over
$2,000,000 of Australian gold, and
the Sub-Treasury has contributed, a
considerable sum to the local money
market by reason of the monthly rise
in the tide of. pension disbursement.
The abundance. of money and the high
prices ruling are made the occasion for
much discussion of the general effect
of the influence in the production of
gold in the last few years and of the
issuance of the war loans by creating
great credit funds for disbursement in
the world's markets. The flood of un
varied rumors regarding combinations
and new. controlled railroad world has
considerably abated and has left a
more healthy appearance to the mar
ket The speculative issues in the bond
market have been very active and have
made some sensational advances. The.
tone ! for investment bonds has been
firm.
United States 4s have advanced %
per cent during the week.

James Johnson of Oakland laid down
his '.'basket grip" on a bench in the
Ferry station and James Ryan picked
it up and was hurrying westward when
he was overtaken and arrested by the
policeman whom the Oaklander had
notified of his loss. After he had
pleaded that he took the property in
mistake for a somewhat similar recep
tacle owned by himself, Mr. Ryan was
given four months by Judge Cabaniss.
"I'm sorry I can't sentence you to
penal servitude for life Instead of or
dering your confinement in the County
Jail for six months," said Judge Mogan
to L. A. Lander, who was arrested for
publicly distributing advertisements of
a disorderly house on Taylor street of
which his female consort and sole
means of sjupport was an Inmate.
While the French ship Guerveur lay
at Howard street wharf Joseph Terrin,
an able seaman, suddenly became mu
tinous and kicked in the cabin door in
order to reach Captain Adolph Carbinls,
whom he Intended to attack. Other
officers of the vessel overpowered the
frenzied mariner, manacled him and
had him in irons twenty-four hours
when one of his messmates went
ashore and told Patrolmen Dower and
McGrath of the occurrence. They
promptly went aboard, released the
prisoner and then took him to the Har
bor station and booked him for mali
cious mischief and disturbing the
peace. When the case came up before
Judge Cabaniss the master of the ves
sel claimed' sole right" to the defend
ant's custody, as the latter's offense
was committed on a ship carrying the
French flag and it was the captain's
intention to have the offender tried and
punished in France. The Judge then
sentenced the defendant to fifteen days'
imprisonment in order to give the
French Consul time to take whatever
action he deemed proper in the prem
ises. An attorney for the defense made
strenuous objection to the ruling,
which, he alleged, would be likely to
result in most serious, international
complications. The court passively lis
tened to the protest and stood firm.
Mrs. A. R. Gray, a young housewife
residing at 35 Russ street, stoutly de
nied that either she or Mrs. Anna Seal,
who was visiting her at the time,
sprinkled dirty water upon or' struck
with a broom or otherwise assaulted
Mon Lee when he drew a knife and
threatened to slay if he were not paid
for the soiling of certain articles of
feminine apparel which Mrs. Gray had
intrusted to him to be properly laun
dered.
Mon Lee, however, just as firmly
averred that Mrs. Seal smote him with
a broom handle and threw dirty water
upon him while his back was turned
toward her. As for the Jl 50 which
Mrs. Gray had refused to pay him, he
did not care one snap of his finger for
that. What he did object to was the
way in which the women treated him
after he had delivered the washing and
mildly endeavored to collect the money.
He was retreating in a most orderly
manner, more pained than angry, when
the broom and the unclean aqua visited
him. No, he had not drawn a knife,
because he had no knife to draw.
Judge Mogan deemed Mon Lee's un
supported testimony inadequate to off
set the two statements for the prose
cution, t and next Saturday the defend
ant will be sentenced for disturbing
the peace.
Maggie Flores, who has been a va

GIRL'S ROMANTIC TALE
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, OCTOBER 10, 1904.
34
For the Human Body in Health and
f Disease.
The mention of sulphur will recall to
many of us the early days when our
mothers and grandmothers gave us
our daily dose of sulphur and molasses
every spring and fall.
It was the universal spring and fall
"blood purifier," tonic and cure-all,
and mind you, this old-fashioned rem-
edy was not without merit.
The idea was good* but the remedy
was crude and unpalatable, and a large
quantity had to be taken to get any
effect.. . â¢ .
Nowadays we get all the beneficial
effects of sulphur in a palatable, con-
centrated form, so that a single grain
is far more effective than a tablespoon-
ful of the crude sulphur.
In recent years research and experi-
ment have proven that the best sulphur
for medicinal use is that obtained from
Calcium (Calcium Sulphide) and sold
in drug stores under the name of
Stuart's Calcium Wafers. They are
small chocolate coated pellets and con-
tain the active medicinal principle of
pulphur in a highly concentrated, ef-
fective form.
Few people are aware of the value of
this form of sulphur in restoring and
maintaining bodily vigor and health;
sulphur acts directly on the liver and
excretory organs, and purifies and en-
riches the blood by the prompt elimin-
ation of waste material.
Our grandmothers knew .this when
they dosed us with sulphur and molas-
ses every spring and fall, but the cru-
dity and impurity of ordinary flowers of
sulphur were often worse than the dis-
ease, and cannot- compare with the
modern concentrated preparations of
sulphur, of which Stuart's Calcium
Wafers are undoubtedly the best and
most widely used. Â¦
They are the natural antidote for
liver and kidney troubles and cure con-
stipation and purify the blood in a way
that often surprises patient and physi-
cian alike.
Dr. R. Mj TVllkins while experiment-
Ing with sulphur remedies soon found
that the sulphur from Calcium was su-
perior to any other form. He says:
"For liver, kidney and blood troubles,
especially when resulting from consti-
pation or malaria, I have been sur-
prised at the results obtained from
Stuart's Calcium Wafers. In patients
suffering from boils and pimples and
even deep-seated carbuncles, I have re-
peatedly seen them dry up and disap-
pear in four or five, days, leaving the
skin clear and smooth. Although
Stuart's Calcium Wafers is a proprie-
tary article and sold by druggists, and
for that reason tabooed by many phy-
sicians, yet I know of nothing so safe
and reliable for constipation, liver and
kidney troubles and especially in all
forms of skin disease as ; this remedy "
At any rate people who are tired of
pills, cathartics .and so-called blood
"purifiers," will find in Stuart's Cal-
cium Wafers a far: safer, - more pala-
table and effective : preparation.

PERSONAL.
I "The Governor, I am sure, will not
favor any plan of distribution that will
do the slightest Injustice, to a single
portion of the State, and on this line
he will carefully consider any measure
that will have for Its object the taking
from one section in order to ffive to
another. The â¢* basis must be an
equitable one and it may be discovered
that the teacher, schoolroom or dis
trict basis Is no more perfect than the
child basis.
"I have had some little experience
as county and State superintendent
in apportioning school* funds and I
have given no little thought of late to
the problem before "us"and I confess
that thn solution Is not yet clear to
me. I trust no hasty, action will be
taken, for it is a serious matter. But
we need more money. and we need it
now, and with all due respect to those
who may believe to the ; contrary I
am- of the opinion that, it is but
reasonable and right to ask the State,
for Dubllo education is a , State
matter, to add to the general
school fund a . sum . equal to
59 in lieu of what has;been the fig
ure for forty years-; â^7 per. census
child. We can see that this will help
the situation within a year and it may
take experts and actuaries a score
of years, to solve the, = problem of a
more correct plan of distribution.

"Superintendent Public Instruction."
people, though the number of chil
dren is no greater than eight or ten,
notwithstanding the district covers a
territory twenty miles square. "The
people of such districts deserve great
sympathy and consideration. But
while it is splendid sentiment to be
out in search of the lonely lamb, he
is likewise a good shepherd who has
s /so a care for the main flock.
"It will never be possible to put
â¢very school district on an equality'
with every other school district in
building and equipment, nor will it
be possible or even desirable to pay all
teachers the same wages, even for the
same grade of work. There are teach
ers and teachers, but it is clearly seen
that in. rank and file better salaries
are demanded, else the teaclftng army
is going to suffer in good material
from both desertion and failure to en

charge of battery preferred by Hugh
Wagner, a waiter at the hotel. Pauline
Hall, Nellie Cauley and Clara Dewet
supported the accusation, testifying
that Nicholson had attacked Wagner
without provocation. His Honor im
posed a 55 fine.
Later in the day R. A. Brown, the
Russ House cook, attacked J. J. Ken
ny, the head waiter, and gave him a
severe beating. Policeman Haggett
was notified and he placed Brown un
der arrest on a charge of battery.
Then Steward Nicholson ajivised
Brown not to submit to arrest, aB the
policeman did not have a warrant.
Haggett retorted that if he had more
hands he would take Nicholson along.
The steward defied him. After book
ing Brown at the City Prison Haggett
swore out a warrant for Nicholson's
arrest on a charge of Interfering with
an officer. Nicholson was arrested
and booked at the prison.
DIFFICULT OF SOTjUTTOX.
"I know there are instances in re
mote portions of the State where the
country school is everything to the
"Until about 1876 the distribution
to the districts in the county was made
on census alone; now it Is made part
ly on census or on teacher and part
ly on average daily attendance. A
school district is given $500 from the
school fund (State and c,ounty) for
every teacher assigned to it, and the'
number of teachers Is determined by
counting one teacher for every sev
enty census children or fraction of sev
enty not less than twenty census chil
dren. To school districts having less
than twenty and ten or more but $400
is given. ' The balance remaining .af
ter distribution on teacher basis Is ap
portioned to the districts, according to
their average daily attendance.
"The principle of raising money on
property and distributing it on chil
dren has lone been deemed funda
mental and herein lies the trouble.
Population has greatly increased in
certain centers, in the cities, and cor
respondingly dwindled In distant rural
communities. It is a' very rare thing
to find a country school of over twen
ty-five children. Th'e'Vlverage of coun
try districts in remote counties Is not
more than ten or twelve. Under ex
isting law a school district is con
tinued from year to year and draws
public money so long as It keeps its
average daily attendance during the
year above five pupils. The law has
been very liberal in permitting the es
tablishment of school districts in the
country wherever fifteen census chil
dren residing two miles from a Echool
houee are found, and in permitting
continuance so long as the - average
dally attendance does not fall to five or
less. It is a .nice point of equity to
determine whether a school district
with but say six children to educate
is entitled to the same bounty from
the State as the district which has an
average of say forty or more children.
The Governor, if I; understand him,
v/ould give the same money to each
district In these two cases. We must
ever be mindful of the weak and the
few, but we cannot afford to be un
! just to the many. There are many
more small country school districts
than there should be. Many of them
should be combined, and where there
are now three and four teachers, each
with a dying or dead school for want
ol numbers, there should be instead
but one wide-awake living school and
one teacher. .
DISTRIBUTION" OF FUNDS.
"It is evident to every one that
without additional money we can help
the needy only by taking from those
whom we think can spare it, and It is
no easy matter for one who takes all
things into account to determine what
portion of the State Is getting too
much.
"The State does not, as some er
roneously think, give to every census
child $7. This figure is solely to guide
the State Board of Equalization. Said
board is required td fix annually such
a State school tax rate as will produce
a sum equal to $7 per census child.
This is paid into the State treasury
and is distributed to the different
counties ln proportion to school cen
sus children reported by them at the
preceding Api.l school census.

OAKLAND, Oct. 15. â There is a
row on Â¦ among â¢ the directors of the
Pacific Oyster Company with its head
quarters at the town of Hay wards, and
R. E. Darbee, L. P. Eaton, F. C. Im
mel. S. U. Darbee and T. B. Russell
owning 519 shares of the capital stock
of the corporation have asked for an
injunction to keep R. H. Countryman,
Sim Lazansky, C. P. Ove'rton, J. W.
Pew, John R. Daggett and F. T. Mar
tens, who between them have but 465
shares of stock, from enjoining them
from holding an election next Tues
day to increase the board of directors.
The trouble arose on a recent elec
tion of directors and a suit is now
pending in San Francisco Involving
the legality of it. In the meantime
in order to forestall the decision of
the court a special election has been
called for the purpose of increasing
the number of directors from five to
seven, and by this means still keeping
control of the board. A temporary
writ .was granted this afternoon and
the matter will be heard next Monday.

The Baldwin & Howell syndicate
has decided to materially enlarge the
residence park, plans for which on a
smaller scale were about to be adopt
ed. At the last moment the owners
of several adjoining parcels concluded
to sell, and these tracts will be in
cluded In the proposed park. The ad
ditional land acquired involves an out
lay of between $30,000 and* $40,000,
but as It greatly improves the sym
metry of the park, the syndicate con
cluded to make the purchase.
The largest piece included in the
deal was bought from Theodore H.
Hlttell, his tract being about an acre
and a half in area. The price is un
derstood to be somewhere between
$25,000- and $30,000. These new
acquisitions involve quite a radical
change in the plan of the park, conse
quently the competitive designs sub
mitted by the five architects several
weeks ago have been discarded and
others will be called for.
The area of. the park now amounts
to about eleven acres. The increased
size will permit of a much more elab
orate scheme for adornment than the
original plan. The principal frontage
will be on First avenue. The wall of
the Presidio reservation will be the
northerly line of the park, while the
southerly line will run parallel with
Lake street and about 100 feet north
of it. The lots will vary in size from
50 to 100 feet frontage and will all
face on a circular drive in the center
of the park. A handsome stone en
trance gate will be constructed on
First avenue, opposite Washington
street. The Dark will be Inclosed by
an ornamental fence.
The center of the driveway and the
edges of the sidewalks will be adorned
with shrubs, grass and flowers, and all
street work will be . completed and the
lots graded and put }n shape for build
ing before the property is placed on
the market. The park will be ex
clusively for residences, the cost of
which will probably be limited to a
minimum of $7500. Baldwin & Howell
state that they expect to place the
property on the market about the first
of the year.
'' The last of |the vacant blocks for
merly owned by the Baird estate is
now. offered for sale in subdivisions
by Lyon & Hoag. The property was
sold about two weeks ago and the
new owner has instructed the agents
to off er the property at private sale
in somewhat larger lots than Is usual
in such cases. The lots vary In width
from 25 feet to 60 feet. The property
has been made ready for building.
All the street j work surrounding j the
block has been Â« done, including the
grading, -sewering, bltuminizing . and
stone walks. The sale of the Balrd
block, which has occupied about two
years, has resulted in a â¢ complete
change in . the appearance of the Pan
handle district. : In place of the then

ALAMEDA. Oct. 15. â Owlnr to tha
lack of harmony that has existed in
the Fire Department since the bis
blaze on Sherman street and Central
avenue In August, and which has been
the cause of much severe criticism of
the local fire fighting service, the Citpr
Trustees have decided to abolish tha
three remaining volunteer companies
and substitute "call" men on a par
tially paid basis.
This proposed action of tha munici
pal legislators Is meeting with somÂ»
opposition from Thompson, Sherman
and Whidden hose companies. These
organization are not altogether against
disbandment, but are determined that
if such action Is to be taken It will not
be on the ground of alleged failure oÂ£
the volunteer firemen to do their duty,
at the Sherman street blaze.
Since the fire in question two inves
tigations have been held, the second
taking place last night before three
of the City Trustees, President J. F.
Forderer, W. M. Bowers and B. E.
Combs. Foreman George T. Morris.
Thomas R. Hanson, A. P. Smiley and
William Follrath of Thompson Hoss
Company and Foreman George Wulzen
of Sherman Hose Company addressed
the City Trustees and refuted the re
flections that had been cast upon
members of their organizations with
relation to their work at the Shermaa
street fire.
All efforts by lawyers, Sheriffs and
process servers to trace and locate
former City Treasurer Z. T. Gilpin,
who left Oakland last July, have failed
utterly, and his friends in this city
deny that they have any knowledge of
his whereabouts. Recently an effort
was made to serve Gilpin i with a copy
of an attachment levied on a piece of
property owned jointly by him and his
wife. After a considerable interval
the papers were returned by Sheriff
Charles Keena- of Placer County, with
a notation that the man could not be
found.
,The former City Treasurer left this
city Just after an attachment had been
levied by H. Blals, a money lender,
against the Standard Wood Company,
which was owned by Gilpin and G. W.
Jackson. Gilpin went to Colfax and
was last seen at that place on July
30, when he had a long interview with
Jackson to whom he gave a. bill of
sale of his Interest In the company.
On the day after Gilpin left Oakland
another attachment was levied by W.
H. Dean against a piece of property
owned by Miss May Gilpin, on a claim
of $3600, assigned to the Dean Law
and Collection Agency by Dr. W. D.
Huntington.
When an attempt was made to serve
the papers on Gilpin he was not to be
found either here or at Colfax.

On searching the dead man's cloth-
Ing last evening the Coroner's deputy
found fraternity pins showing that he
was an Odd Fellow, a Grand Army vet
eran and a member of the A. O. II. W.
In his memorandum book were the
words: "If anything happens notify
Mrs. H. L. B., Portland, Or., 331 West
Park street."
Deputy Coroner Strelghtiff sent a
telegram to the foregoing address, ask
ing what disposition should be made
of the body.
Players and spectators ignored the
circumstance. The game proceeded
without interruption. At its finish the
body was removed to the local Morgue,'
under the direction of Deputy Coroner
Strelghtiff.
None knew the man. Deputy Mar
shal Howard took from his clothing a
card, which Identified him as L. H.
Buddemer of Portland, Or. He was
about 60 years old, well dressed, and
apparently came aloncv to the football
game. It was quickly rlimored that the
dead man was a relative and perhaps
the father of A. Budleman, substitute
right guard of the California freshman
team. Budleman is from Oergon. He
looked at the corpse and said that the
old man was a stranger to him.
The body was left to He on the
ground under the staging of the un
completed bleachers until the game
was finished. A black cloth covered
the corpse.
While the football giants of Berkeley
and Stanford were fighting for victory
on California field, and rooters brass
bands and private citizens created a
din, L. H. Buddemer, â¢ a spectator,
raised his hat and started to cheer,
then fell back, helpless to the ground.
He had sustained a stroke which
paralyzed his heart action and he died
in thirty minutes.

In order to defend the good name of
his mother, 12-year-old Eddie Harlan
of 1719 Pacific avenue stole a pistol
from a roomer in his mother's house
and he is now being held upon a charge
of burglary preferred against him by
Mrs. Harlan, who objects to the criti
cism of her actions by her young off
spring.
The mother is a comely young col
ored woman, who keeps a boarding
house for Pullman car porters. She
has been receiving the attentions of
one Mr. Smith. The boy protested
against Smith coming to the house,
and says Smith told him that if trouble
was made he (Smith) would fill him
full of lead. According to the state
ment made by the mother to Assistant
District Attorney Brown it was Smith's
skin rather than the boy's that was in
danger, and Bhe asked to be allowed to
swear to a charge of burglary against
him for stealing the weapon so that he
might be sent to a reform school.
The lad admits taking the weapon,
but denies he intended to shoot Smith
unless he had to. He says he got the
pistol to protect himself and his moth
er, as he believed that Smith was a bad
man and would do her harm. He is be
ing held, and in the meantime an in
vestigation Is to be made to find out
the facts of the case.
WOULD DEFEND
MOTHER'S NAME
Immediately after the discovery was
made the police were notified by the!
railroad officials, and a search for the
missing man is now being made. It
was hard for McCabe's superiors and !
his office associates to believe that he j
had been guilty of wrong doing, and j
they are yet at a loss for a suggestion j
as to what he did with the money. Â¦ -j
The auditors are not through with \
their Investigation, but have nearly Â¦
completed their experting of the sea- j
son's accounts. Last season's books ap
pear to be all right. ;
Ther is no longer any mystery at
tached to the strangre disappearnce of
James 8. McCabe, chief clerk to Assist
ant Passenger Agent Judah of the
Southern Pacific Company. A cause j
for his absence from his office was found j
yesterday, when the auditing depart- j
rnent of the company discovered that I
there Is a shortage in his acounts of a
trifle over 51000, representing: moneys
received from various local organiza
tions for the use of excursion trains i
during the recent picnic season, which j
McCabe had failed to properly account
for.

H. Quatman, of the C. M. Wooster

The engagement is announced of Dr.

of Louis Vogel. The majrriage will
take place in the spring and will be

the best known families in Gotham,
while the groom has hosts of friends
in San Francisco to wish him well.

Mare Island has come to be a festive
spot for Cupid. Each moon brings na
val nuptials, but none have been more
exquisite in detail than the wedding of
Miss Helen Frances Simons and Pay
master Frank O. Branch.
St. Peter's quaint little chapel was
gayly garbed yesterday in white,
chrysanthemums nodding invitingly at
each pew. Cosmos was banked in pro
fusion on the altar, from which a soft,
mellow light fell from many brass
sconces.
The bride, gowned in an ivory satin
robe, trimmed in old lace, entered the
chapel on the arm of her father. Medi
cal Inspector H. M. Simons, U. S. A.
Preceding her to the rail were Miss
Theodora S. Simons, maid of honor,
and Hiss Emily Berard Simons and
Miss Sally Spaulding Simons as brides
maids, all smartly gowned in white
organdy and lace. Short tulle veils
formed a pretty detail of the brides
maids' toilet.
The groom was assisted by Paymas
ter M. R. Goldsborough.
After the ceremony, at which. Chap
lain A. A. McAlister officiated, a large
reception was held at the home of the
bride, which was transformed into an
Edenic garden for the glad affair.
Mr. and Mrs. Branch will go a-honey
mooning in the south â tlie mecca of
redded lovers.

Hofmann Farewell Concert.
A will contest begun two years ago
by Pauline Levy, now Pouline Gordan,
is likely to be dismissed on October 17
on motion of the heirs of Henry Levy,
who died November 1, 1901. .T. E.
Pawlicki and Otto Irving' Wise, attor
neys for the heirs, yesterday gave no
tice that they would move for the dis
missal on the grounds that no citation
was served within a year 'and the ac
tion has not been further prosecuted.
The contestant was the widow of the
deceased â his second wife.' She al
leged that he had been influenced and
menaced by his three grown children,
who committed actual violence and
threatened bodily harm if he married
Pauline, or willed her any of his prop
erty. The estate was appraised at
$41,419.

The Election Commissioners object
to placing the amendments on the bal
lots. They maintain that the amend
ments are unconstitutional on two ac
counts; first, that the Mayor must ap
prove them and second, that two years
have not elapsed, as called for by law,
before the charter may be amended.
The plaintiffs declare that, the last
amending of the charter by the Leg
islature took place February. 25,
1903, although the amendments were
voted upon by the people on Decem
ber 6, 1902. Therefore they claim
that although the amendments may be
voted upon and passed by the people
next November the charter is not of
ficially amended until the Legislature
acts, which may be as late as Febru
ary 25, 1905. By doing this the ne
cessary two years will elapse between
amendings of the charter.
James N. Harrison, plaintiff and
petitioner, through his counsel, con
sisting of Assistant City Attorney Pat
ridge, C. H. King and G. W. Lane, has
brought suit in the Supreme Court
direct, to compel the Election Com
missioners to place the proposed twen
ty-two charter amendments on the bal
lots to be used at the coming elec
tion. The counsel for the Election
Commissioners consists of Devoto and
Richardson. The Supreme Court has
consented to try the case without its
appearance in the Superior Court, so
that a decision may be reached before
election, and no appeal therefrom be
taken.

It is the ability to do something, to ac

success and wealth is a simple one. It
consists in saving your money, which is
otherwise thrown away, until you have
acquired an independence. Money begets

All druggists sell charcoal In one :
form or another, but probably the best j
charcoal and the most for the money is ,
in Stuart's Charcoal Lozenges; they \
are composed' of the finest powdered '
Willow charcoal, and other harmless j
antiseptics In tablet form or rather in i
the form of large, pleasant tasting loz- j
enges, the charcoal being mixed with
honey: â¢ j
The daily use of these lozenges will I
eoon tell in a much improved condition i
of the general health, better complex-
Ion; sweeter breath and purer blood, I
and the beauty of it is that no possible j
harm can result from their continued \
use, but, on the contrary, great benefit, i
A Buffalo .physician in speaking of I
the benefits of charcoal says: "I ad- i
vise Stuart's Charcoal Lozenges to all ;
patients suffering from gas In stomach j
and bowels, and to clear the complex-
ion and purify the breath, mouth and
throat; I also believe the liver is great-
ly benefited by the daily use of them;
they cost but twenty-five cents a box at
drug stores, -and although In some sense
a patent preparation, yet I believe I
get more and better charcoal in Stuart's !
Charcoal Lozenges than in any of the
ordinary charcoal tablets."
ij Nearly everybody knows that char-
coal is the safest and most efficient
disinfectant and purifier in nature, but
few realize its value when taken into
the human system for the same cleans-
Ing purpose.
Charcoal Is a remedy that the more
you take of it the better; It is not a
drug at all, but simply absorbs the
gases and impurities always present
in the stomach and Intestines and car-
ries them out of the system.
Charcoal sweetens the breath after
smoking, drinking or after eating
onions and other odorous vegetables.
Charcoal effectually clears and im-
proves the complexion, it whitens the
teeth and further acts as a natural
and eminently safe cathartic.
It absorbs the injurious gases -which
collect in the stomach and bowels; it
disinfects the mouth and throat from
the poison of catarrh.

The difficulties of their task and their
heavy losses compelled the Russians
to abandon their efforts to capture
the heights commanding Tumin Pass.
Meanwhile the Japanese attacks upon
the entire Russian front continued.
This probably led to the orders to the
east column on the night of October
13 to retreat from the passes. The
detachments on the flanks also re
treated, but the fight was continued
in another place about 2 o'clock in the
morning. The artillery fire which be
gan on the southwest front, seemingly
near Shakhe, on the morning of Fri
day became heavier and continued
throughout the day, despite the storm
of rain and hail, and it is continuing
now, at midnight.

MUKDEN, Friday, Oct. 1 4. â News
has been received here to the effect
that one of the Russian eastern col
umns has overcome the desperate re
sistance of the Japanese and captured
Lumin Pass, which opens a direct
route to the right flank of the Jap
anese main positions at Yentai mines.
If the report is true General Kuropat
kin's plans have succeeded and the
Russians have taken the Japanese in
flank and rear. ' One more effort, it
is asserted,' and the Japanese must re
treat with heavy loss from the Shakhe
River or run the risk of being cut off
from the army between the Shakhe
and ShIH rivers and annihilated. But,
it is added, it "must â¢ be remembered
that flanking movements are double

PLAY IS UNUSUAL.
Both the Stanford freshmen and the
blue and gold "babies" played 'good
football sporadically yesterday at
Berkeley. Again they seemed to grow
tired on one side or the other and then
it was any one's game. The cardinal
won the victory with their score of 6,
but California advanced the ball scores
of yards more than her opponents in a
straight rushline game. Stanford was
strong in Fenton, her little quarter and
kicker, but California's running backs
and two-thirds of her line as well had
the cardinal men opposite them dis
counted, i
It was poor headwork that lost the
game to the blue and gold. The home
eleven had the ball seven yards from
their" opponents' goal line in the second
half on a first down. Stanford had
scored 6 and California was a touchdown
to the good. The blue and gold backs
gained j four and a half yards of the
necessary five in two downs. It looked
like a splendid chance to push a back
through center for a touchdown or at
least a half-yard gain, but the signal
called for an end run through the mud
and a cardinal tackle nailed the runner
for a loss.
It seemed the unanimous opinion of
the football critics that California
should have won on form if punting
was not a feature of the game. In
kicking the cardinal boys gained yards
upon yards. Fenton was always there
with a swift foot to balance up the
play. The greatest point of interest in
the game was a peculiar situation
caused by Fenton's doing what he was
not expected to do and which ordina
rily would have been poor football. \

; The "interference "on both 'teams was
pobrV yesterday 'in nine plays 'out ' of
every ten.". Thia'sort of thing five the
terback. The little chap caught the pig
skin and instead of running, as is the
custom under such circumstances, he
booted the ball back over the heads of
his own team and of his opponents who
were rushing in a body to tackle him.
The football soared through the air
and landed fifteen yards from Califor
nia's goal. The blue and gold freshmen
thought the pigskin would roll over
the line and they did not touch it. The
ball stopped, however, a foot from the
goal posts and while the two elevens
were gazing at it in indecision, Fenton,
who had returned the punt, came
through the crowd and dropped on the
pigskin.
Then there was the wildest kind of
an uproar, -If Fenton was "on side" it
was Stanford's ball... If he was not, it
was a touchback for California and her
kicker could easily have . punted the
ball out of danger. The rules were pro
duced, but there were no regulations
for this kind of a play. The tired
youths who were fighting for suprem
acy were given a long rest while the
officials tried to get some light on the
question.
The rules say that a fullback cannot
put himself on 'side when he receives
the ball from one of : his own men. In
this case Fenton < caught Riley's punt,"
and thereforedid not get the ball from
his own team. .-. Referee Fickert main
tained that Fenton was "on side," while
other officials and coaches disagreed.
On the advice of "Jim" Lanagan,' coach
for the cardinal, . it was decided to ac
cept the referee's ruling temporarily,
proceed J with j the game and .then refer
the whole matter to the national foot
ball rules committee In New York. Last

REMARKABLE PLAY
PUZZLES EXPERTS
OF THE GRIDIRON
AT THE RUSSIAN FRONT. Thurs
day, Oct. 13. â The Japanese offensive
began on Tuesday along the whole
line. The heaviest work was on the
Russian extreme right, where the
fighting for the possession of Hau and
Tumin passes did not cease until mid
right. The Russians succeeded in
capturing the latter, though at fearful
cost. Â«
The position at Poltasautzi, still
further toward the Taitse River, held
by the Tomsk regiment, was furious
ly assaulted and the regiment lost
heavily. The Tamboff regiment extri
cated itself from a seemingly hope
less position and succeeded In effect
ing its retirement. The Russians stuck
to most of their positions heroically
on Tuesday, except at the Schill River.
On the morning of Wednesday the
Japanese renewed their attack, pre
paring the way for their infantry with
an artillery bombardment. At noon
the Russian right began falling back.
but the attack upon the Russian cen
ter and left weakened perceptibly. The
trtillery fire slackened in the evening,
but the rifle fire continued with little
intermission throughout the night
The Japanese to-day (Thursday)
renewed their attacks and the battle
proceeded with varying success, but
on the whole favorable to the Japan
ese, as the Russians continued to give
ground.
The Russian wounded are being sent
north to Harbin.

thuslasm, until it was declared that he
was filling up a mudhole that the play
ers might not soil their garments.
Whether the famous educator's act was
a hoodoo for California remains to be
seen. President Wheeler made bis ap
pearance shortly afterward, and until
the end of the contest the two savants
wandered up and down the field to
gether, , unhampered by officials,
coaches, policemen or other people who
get their delight out of life by telling
spectators of football games to "move
on."
GAME IS EXCITTXG.
When the California freshmen trotted
across the field there was a tremen
dous burst of applause and organized
cheering from the grand stand. The
youngsters went through a brief prac
tice as if they were oblivious of the
thousands who had pinned hopes on
their ability to defeat another eleven
from another home of learning.
Stanford's appearance did not evoke
quite the ecual of the applause given
their rivals, but there seemed to be
more dainty, little college girls waving
cardinal than blue and gold, and that
was plenty of encouragement if there
had not been a single shout.
Once the ball was in play eyes
brightened and teeth were clenched in
excitement. The lads from the State
University were the heavier, they said.,
and they seemed to push their oppo
nents down the field easily. After al
most every clash for a time the blue
and gold adherents were showing their
Joy in their own unmistakable college
way. There was a restless murmur*
from the Stanford side, like the moan
iug of the sea at Bakers Beach when
the, tide is going out.
When at last the cardinal boys held
their opponents for three fierce rushes
the grand stand ceased to look lopsided
in its enthusiasm. -But, alas! the fair
Â¦maids with the. bright bonnets forgot
to wave their well wishes and lost their
pleasant smiles when a begrimed boy
went across Stanford's goal line, with
the ball and owned up that he be
longed to California when the officials
had removed twenty-one men from his
body and dug him from the mud. Then
was the time the blue and gold flut
tered in' the breeze, while pleased "-il
excited thousands made the grand
stand tremble as they applauded.
FEXTOVS SENSATIONAL PLAY. â¢
It was only ten minutes later that
Captain Fenton. Stanford's hero, made
the sensational play upon which the
cardinal's score depended. Each con
tingent had the chance to cheer, for
a score and honors were equally di
vided. But when Stanford kicked the
goal, a feat which their opponents had
failed to accomplish, there was more
blue than gold in the California sec
tion. Another touchdown by Califor
nia would have won her the victory,
but it could not be done, although the
struggling youths fought for it until
they were exhausted.
Finally the referee announced the
end of the contest, and there was no
immediately victorious team. Many
thought Stanford had won, but as the
news of the actual conditions spread
the applause slackened. Off the field
trotted the players, substitutes ati-3
trainers, through the gateways leaked
the mighty attendance. In the middle
of the gridiron the officials took their
stand to argue the great disputed play,
the Berkeley youth came from Its
perch In the trees about the fence and
the freshman intercollegiate football
game for 1904 was ovi*-- ~V
The football game between the fresh
men elevens of the University of. Cali
fornia and of Stanford University at
Berkeley yesterday was a wildly excit
ing contest. Sensational and spectacu
lar plays were quite the order of the
day. The enthusiasm of the adherents
of the blue and gold and of the car
dinal knew no bounds. But it took the
national football rules committee in
New York to tell that Stanford won the
game by a score of 6 to B.
For a long time there was a dispute
over the validity of a certain peculiar
play, on which the cardinal's score de
pended, and when the game was over
no one knew who had won. The Call
immediately telegraphed to the football
rules committee in New York and ob
tained the ruling which gives the vic
tory to the "babies" of Stanford. The
spectators got all the entertainment
they could expect to find at a football
contest. â¢
The cardinal can boast of the hero of
the day. His name is Fenton. He was
ever in the thickest of the battle. His
kicking saved Stanford from certain
defeat. His running and hurdling when
he had the ball were sensational
enough to bring the rooters of Califor
nia to their feet. Three times he leaped
over the heads of men who were at
tempting to bring him down. He kept
his head in moments when more expe
rienced men would have failed. He was
bruised and trampled upon until the or
dinary boy would have begged to be
taken to a hospital, and yet he con
tinued to run and plunge and tackle,
while he encouraged his followers. As
the doubtul play has been decided in
Stanford's favor, little Fenton deserves
all the glory, for it was he who turned
the trick in the cardinal's hour of need.
; CROWD COMES EARLY.
YesterdayV game was the formal
dedication of Â¦ California field. â¢Â¦ The
weather was perfect for the spectators,
although it was rather hot for. the play
ers. The sun shone warmly, the air
was clear and white and fleecy clouds
were floating across the sky. Back of
the grand stand rose the massive hills,
giving the scene an appearnce of ma
jesty and grandeur.
For more than an hour before the
game commenced a thick, black stream
of humanity was making its sluggish
course up the slopes from the gymna
sium. The trees and the tops of the
houses around the fenced gridiron were
swarming with -eager youngsters.
Wherever the workmen had failed to
make the fence boards fit there was a
small mob fighting for the peephole.
The gates were Jammed with people
struggling to enter, for there were no
reserved seats, and . those â¢ who came
first secured the points of vantage. Be
tween the gates and the entrances to
the front of the grand stand the way
was littered with lumber, Y tools and
other debris left by the builders. While
one picked his way across this litter he
was entertained by the steady chink
arid thug of American coin as the box
office clerks swept it into their yawn
ing treasure chests.
All was color and life on the grand
stand. Over here solid, masses of peo

they grew' hoarse. Over there the

CAPTAIN FENTON
PROVES THE HERO
OF THE OCCASION
The same evening the Russian com
mander gave imperative orders to re
occupy Endotiula. The Zaraisk regi
ment, without firing a single shot,
marched under cover of darkness and
bayoneted several battalions of the
Japanese, many of whom died as they
slept. A few Japanese escaped and
sought shelter In stacks of Chinese
corn, but the Russians, carried away
by the frenzy of revenge, rushed upon
the survivors and literally t<jre up their
bodies with bayonets. The Russians
then rolled themselves in the Japanese
blankets. The next morning the Japa
nese again shelled out the regiment,
while their artillery came on at a run
and secured a position east of the rail
road.
Again General Kuropatkin ordered
the Russians to retake the position,
but the efforts of his troops were in
vain. The Russains could not reach
the Japanese trenches, so withering
was the Japanese fire, and only a few
returned where companies had
charged. The companies in some
cases were commanded by sergeants
after the officers had fallen. One offi
cer, his face streaming with blood,
limped up to the general, who was
furious.
"Where is your company?" asked
the general.
"This is all that la left of it." re
plied the officer. "It was like a
slaughter-house."
The artillery fight on Wednesday
Â¦was the fiercest of the war. The Jap
anese handled their guns superbly and
chose splendid positions. Their guns
seemed to have every range measured.
They would concentrate the fire of 200
guns first on one place and then on
another. Some of the Russian regi
ments were literally shot to pieces.
The bombardment reached a climax
at 5 o'clock in the afternoon, when
the Japanese tried to envelop and
brenk through the Russian left wing.
MUKDEN, Oct. 15.â One of the blood
iest episodes of the desperate fighting
between the Shakhe River and Tentai
during the last three days occurred at
the village of Endotiula, west of the
railroad, and on the neighboring
heights east of the railroad. The Japa
nese had been driven out of these po
sitions with terrible losses, but on Octo
ber 13 they concentrated such a mur
derous artillery fire on the village that
it became necessary for the Russians
to withdraw, the railroad, however, be
ing held.

ed. The Red Cross field hospitals have
mobilized all their forces. There is a
great lack of bandaging material.
ST. PETERSBURG, Oct. 16, 2 a. m.â
Jill accounts agree that the battle of
Liaoyang is already being overshad
owed in fierceness and the number of
casualties by that of Mukden. It is
now the sixth day of desperate fight-
Ing and the issue is still in the balance.
The feeling in St. Petersburg is one
of extreme gloom and depression. The
lack of official news, the undoubted re
trogression from General Kuropatkin s
aggressive movement and the enor
mous Russian losses in men and guns,
compared with the optimistic reports
from Tokio, all combine to prepare the
public for anything 6hort of a total
rout of the Russians. Nevertheless, the
reports <~<f the newspaper correspond
ents at the front, while admitting. the
heavy losses of the Russian troops and
their retreat beyond Shakhe, describe
the Eoldiers as fighting with undimin-
Ished ardor. One dispatch even hints
at extremely encouraging news from
the eastern flank, but counsels patience
and official confirmation before accept
ing It as true.
There is a noteworthy absence of bit
terness against General Kuropatkin.
and the belief is prevalent that he was
compelled to assume the offensive. A
majority of the people are inclined to
regard him as a victim of circum
stances, and all admire the skillful
manner in which he again removed his
forces as soon as he realized the dan
ger of pressing the advance. The re
port that he personally assumed com
mand of three divisions in order to
cover the retreat finds widespread
credence.
THE result of the game Is perfectly satisfactory to me. I
thought from the first that Referee Fiekert's decision should
be accepted. The California eleven did splendid work and I .
am glad they were so successful. It was not a defeat of which she
should be in any way ashamed. These freshman games are always
uncertain and sometimes much the better team will lose Its spirit
and the contest after some reverse. Stanford played creditable foot
ball as far as I could observe. Personally I enjoyed the game and
look forward to next year's struggle with unabated interest. I do .
not wish to criticize the playing of either team and I believe that
to-day's contest was an unusually good exhibition of freshman foot
ball.

PUNTING IS FREQUENT.

and after the line-up Fenton kicked
back twenty-five yards. Riley fumbled
In the first rush and Stanford got the
ball. Fenton punted outside for five
yards in return. After a preliminary
rush Riley kicked to Stanfords' twenty
yard line and Fenton sent'the ball back
to center.
Snowden, Sperry and Riley went
right at the Cardinal and worked the
ball down to their opponents'-seven
yard line in fifteen plays. Here Stan
ford held for downs and Fenton kicked
out of danger. Tomasini secured the
pigskin on a fumble and Fenton forth

Riley punted twenty yards. Stanford
kicked back twenty-five yards and
California worked in a punt which
rolled almost to the Cardinal goal line.
Riley got through, blocked Fenton's
punt and fell on the ball for a touch
down. After Riley got over his. first
flush of pleasure at being a hero and
his comrades had ceased cavorting,
Richardson tried for the goal and
missed.
Stanford kicked forty yards after
the line-up. Kendall caught the punt
and came back ten. The Blue and
Gold failed to make their distance and
punted. S Fenton booted the ball back
twenty-five yards and after a prelim
inary rush California kicked way
down the field. Stanford called for a
kick, but the signals -were misin

back toward the Cardinal goal. A

ends a splendid chance to distinguish
themselves. Stanford had a trifle bet
ter team work than her rival. The
tackling was a credit to both elevens
and to their coaches. There was but
little grasping of arras or heads to stop
runners, and besides saving injuries it
was much prettier and more effective.
The California backs were speedier and
kept their feet better. The biggest part
of the blue and gold line was stronger
than that of the cardinal, and this pre
vented the visitors from gaining ground
by bucking. Tomasini had rather the
better of Stow and Koerner, and Over
man had the opposing ends guessing
frequently, but otherwise the Stanford
line was working against odds.
California made a big. gain on a fake
kick, but few other tricks were tried
and none others proved successful.
There were but two penalizations, one
for offside and one for interfering with
a' fair catch. The men on both teams
were in poor condition, which, aided by
the hot weather, made the game go

work was seen occasionally. Coe. the
cardinal's center, was ruled off for
slugging. The officials performed their
work creditably. The annual freshman
game is always an uncertainty, as the
players generally are not in good condi
tion and do not remain steady at crit
ical moments. Yesterday's contest was
better than an average freshman game.
California had better weight than Stan

excellent showing in line bucking and

The general opinion among the
sportsmen who returned last night was
that 'the opening of the season was
auspicious and that great sport is in
prospect once weather conditions settle.
SUISUN. Oct. 16.â The duck shoot
ing season opened, at daylight this
morning with a fusillade of shots on
the marshes. On some < of the pre
serves ducks were plentiful, while dn
others they were scarce. The recent
rains haVe caused the game to scatter.
â¢Compared with years; there
were but few San Francisco sportsmen
in evidence on the opening day. The
largest string reported was that of
William Pierce and W. S. Merrill, who
bagged sixty birds. Other strings were:
Dr, A. G. Bailey 21, L. H. Pimental
30, Walter Coper 33, Fred Chadbourne
13. Dr. B. P. Kemp 10. Good reports
are reported from the Pringle, Tomas

composed of San Francisco sportsmen.
The football game between Mission
and Ixwell High schools, played yes
terday, ended In a tie, neither side scor
ing. F-oth teams played as hard as if
the championship was at stake, and
ihe battle, although not particularly
interesting, was considerable of a slug
ging match.
After the game two of the opposing
players got into an argrument and came
to blows. The battle of fists, although
shorter than the game, proved of more
interest.
ThÂ« feature of the same, aside from
the flstiouffs, was a seventy-five- yard
run made by La Coste of Mission, in
the first half. After passing every man
on the opposing team and reaching the
ten-yard line La Coste tripped and fell.
Monteagle, who was several yards be
hind, fell on him and Mission failed to
ecore.
The wearers of the pink and green
twice had the ball on their opponents'
live-yard line, but the Lowell boys
braced each time and Mission could not
score. Lowell never got closer than
twenty yards to Mission's goal. The

MORRIS PARK, Oct. 15<â Twenty
thousand persons, by far the largest
number which has been seen at the
fall meeting here, witnessed the note
worthy triumphs of Good and Plenty,
Artful and Shorthose to-day in their
respective races.
There were only four starters for
the Woodlawn^Vase, Shorthose, Gun
fire, Africander and Ostrich. At the
end of the first circuit Odom sent
Shorthose on and well along the back
stretch the purple Jacket moved to
the front, it being Odom's evident de
sire to maintain a strong pace so that
Gunfire could not outrun in the sprint.
All along the back stretch Gunfire was
under a steady pull. Shorthose led by
several lengths around the last turn,
but Shaw had relaxed his pull on Gun
fire and she was coming on. She came
down the center of the course about
two lengths behind Shorthose. About
a furlong from the finish Shorthose
suddenly swerved a trifle to the out
side, but Gunfire was not near enough
to be affected by it. With Shaw do
ing his best to nurse his fast tiring
mare home, Shorthose passed the
judges about one and a half lengths
in front of his game competitor. Afri
cander was third and Ostrich last-
Artful, carrying the heavy impost of
130 pounds, won the White Plains
handicap over the Eclipse Course. She
made a new world's record for six fur
longs, by covering the distance In 1:08,
which is a quarter of a second faster
than the best previous time, made by
Sandria on October 8. Summary:

CHICAGO. Oct. 15. â Bad News,
cleverly ridden by Elmer Helgesen,
scored one of the most brilliant vic
tories of his career by winning the
Columbia Handicap to-day at Worth.
He crossed the winning line two
lengths in the lead of a field of the
best horses in training in the West.
Brancas was second, getting the place
honors by a neck after a desperate
race with Miss Crawford. The other
five starters were badly strung out at
the finish.
Bad News opened an 8 to 5 favorite,
but the Dublic seemed dubious about
his ability to go one and a quarter
miles and backed Huzzah from 4 to 1
to 3 to 1. Bad News' odds meanwhile
soared to 13 to 5, nevertheless he was
the actual favorite at post time. Off
to a good start, Helgesen took Bad
News right to the front and, running
easily, he maintained that position
throughout. The distance was cov
ered In the g-ood time of 2:08 flat, an
excellent performance in view of Bad
News' impost of 123 pounds.
Jade, at 20 to 1, surprised the spec
tators by running away from the best

fielders and one hair-raising catch was
made by Dunleavy. Schafley-commit
ted the only offense, but it did not
counf in the score.
Poor Jack McCarthy is a nervous
wreck from the treatment he received
by the hostile . northern 'Â¦. fans ind he
refused to get into the game. He told
Harris his nerves were all out of com
mission and that he had no confidence
in his decisions and lacked control of
the players. So as a last resort Jimmy
Buchanan and Jimmy Whalen were
sent in to do the fine work. Their
decisions were about perfect and no
one dared open his face to protest.
Wheeler pitched elegant ball, but
the Commuters took advantage of a
little chance in the seventh round and
brought the only two runs over the
plate. Devereaux, the first man up,
was bumped on top of the coke with
a fast one. He was out for a moment,
but finally got back into the running,
though still in a foggy condition.

In the fall of 1895 that fear-

headway that I was forced to resign my
position and seek relief at Hot Springs.
After spending all the means I hadl went
to Memphis. In less than three weeks I
was in a hospital, and after nine weeks of
suffering I \ras discharged as cured. In
less than a month every bone in my body
seemed to be affected and felt as if they
would break at the least exertion. Again
I was compelled to resign, and I returned
to the hospital for a seven weeks stay.
When I came out I was advised to try
farming. When I first went on the farm I
prevailed on the only firm who handled
drugs to get me one dozen bottles of S. S.
S. At that time both of my hands were
broken out with blisters and I was covered
with boils and sores. In the meantime my

ST. PETERSBURG, Oct. 15. â Ac
cording to special dispatches received
here General Kuropatkin had a nar
row escape during the fierce fighting
of Wednesday night and Thursday for
the possession of Temple Hill and the
double-horned mountain east of the
railroad. With his staff he was per
sonally directing the fighting at this
point. Orderlies were constantly gal
loping up with reports from other
parts of the field and carrying dis
patches to and from the telephone
and telegftiph stations, which were
working behind the hills. This evi
dently attracted the attention of the
Japanese, who cleverly unmasked
some batteries, the shells from which
burst all around the distinguished
group, compelling General Kuropat
kin to shift his position hastily and
seek shelter.
It is understood that General Kuro
patkin. before the battle commenced
again, designated Lieutenant Gerferal
Sakharoff and then Lieutenant Gen
eral Bilderling to succeed him in the
command in the event of his being
disabled.

The Stanford students nearly
avenged the loss of the famous red ax
of years ago by the capture of the big
30-foot varsity flag yesterday from the
Berkeley campus. The affair was well
planned and the attemnt made when
the attention of everybody was turned
to the football game. -The flag was
hauled down and 'removed from the
halyards and the three .bold Stanford
men were fast getting to cover when
the armorer of the university noticed
that the big U. C. ensign no longer
proudly waved from the flagpole. He
sounded an, alarm and soon saw the
triple cardinal captors making for
the timber.
. Professor C. W. Woodworth and two
small boys, Monroe Marliare and El
mer Varue. heard the alarm and Im
mediately started in pursuit. The pro
fessor and the lads headed off the
Stanford men, who had their prize
rolled up in ' a "' large bundle, and
turned them into a small wooded
creek. They disappeared in the
bushes, but the trailers were on their
track. They appeared presently with
out the bundle on the other side of
the stream. Professor Woodworth
knew that the closely pursued raiders
had secreted their prize in the bushes.
After beating up .the brush; In the
creek bottom for a short time he
found the flag hidden In the thicket.
The ensign was borne â¢ in , triumph
home and safely locked up by the
armorer, secure from raiding squad
rons of the -cardinal. '

It Is desired that the standard mili
tary rifle in use by the Government
should be made available for civilian
practice and it is probable some provi
sion to this end will be made in the bill
which the board will recommend.
Hundreds of inquiries have been re
ceived from rifle clubs, instructors at
military schools and Individuals as to
how this arm can be procured and
there seems to be little doubt that rifle
practice will be stimulated, especially
among civilians, by the distribution of
the Krag rifle. The Krag carbines will
soon be discarded by the cavalry arm
of - the regular . establishment and . the
national board will seek to obtain pos
session of them for distribution to mil
itary schools, at the rate of about ten
pieces to each school where army offi
cers are detailed as instructors. Â¦._ : ,
' It also , Is . proposed that one carbine
for each twenty-five scholars should be
given schools possessing indoor ranges
and carrying on rifle practice. '
The board recommends the establish
ment of shooting galleries and field
ranges, the furnishing of arms and am
munition, supervision and instruction,
inducements for practice, such as tro
phies, badges, etc., and publication and
distribution of literature bearing on
this subject.
CALL BUREAU. HOTEL BARTON,
WASHINGTON, Oct. 15.â What will
probably be the most important meet
ing of the National Board, for the Pro
motion of Rifle Practice since thafbody
was organized under an act of Con
gress several years ago will be held at
the War Department on October 22.
The national board is composed of
twenty-one members, including five
from the regular army and navy, estab
lishments. The board was instructed to
formulate a plan for a national marks
men reserve, which plan has been
agreed upon and approved by the Sec
retary of War. At the coming meeting.
It is expected, steps will be taken for
the preparation of a bill to be submit
ted to Congress.
It Is not expected that Congress will
act on all the suggestions of the board
at one time, as the scheme for creating
a marksmen's reserve is very compre
hensive and begins with the education
of boys in military schools and pro
vides for the encouragement of rifle
practice for both civilians and members
of the militia on a large and liberal
scale. .' v - ,

ST. PETERSBURG, Oct. 15. â The
extent of the Russian loss is partially
Indicated by the correspondent of the
Russoe Slovo. who telegraphs that
General Bilderling's corps, holding the
center of the right, lost almost an en
tire brigade of the Third division, in
cluding a third of its artillery bri
gade, (forty-eight guns), the neighbor
ing corps being too hard pressed to
offer assistance.
General Zaroubaieff's corps suf
fered terribly before its retreat on Oc
tober 10, his brigade of reserves ar
riving too late. Zaroubaieff himself
narrowly escaped, a shell bursting In
side a hut out of which the general
had just emerged.
General Mistchenko on the left also
suffered heavily. The fighting was at
such close range that his gunners were
mowed down by the Japanese infantry
fire. The Japanese positions which the
Russians were trying to take were sur
rounded on three sides by wire entan
glements, which cost the Russians
dearly. The Japanese in some Instances
abandoned their khaki uniforms,
donned gray overcoats and repeated a
trick they have often employed during
the war. especially in night attacks, of
yelling out in Russian when discovered.

the Russian positions shouting. "Orders,

noon made a counter attack, but they
were successfully repulsed by our left
column. The strength of the enemy
opposing the left column was fully
four regiments of Infantry, with ten
batteries of artillery."
"Our artillery action was beyond
praise. Throughout the day the services
of the guns and the accuracy of the fire
were splendid. An entire battalion of
Japanese was mowed down' while at
tempting to advance, the troops fight
ing brilliantly and blood literally flow
ing in streams. Everywhere death
seems to be a secondary consideration.
"Toward evening the fighting at
Shakhe abated and we and the Japan
ese retained our respective positions.
"Excellent news was received from
the Eastern division on Friday night,
but it is so sensational that it seems in
advisable to give it out until it shall
have been officially confirmed. "We can
only counsel patience. Any hour may
decide the fate of the battle."
"The fighting on Friday morning was I
resumed at 6 o'clock. We again ad- j
vanced from Shakhe, capturing the ad- j
vanced positions held by the Japanese I
by brilliant attacks by the Epifanlev- j
sky and Tukhiovsky regiments. "We I
reached their second line positions, but \
here a fierce artillery fire compelled our !
troops to halt, and a desperate artillery !
duel was commenced. Twelve Japanese '
guns were silenced, every gunner being :
killed and their infantry support being j
driven back. The guns stood In plain â¢
view, but It was Impossible for *us to
take them. Two battalions which were
ordered to secure the Japanese guns
advanced In the face of a terrible can- I
nonade and rifle fire from the Japanese !
rear positions. It was, however, an im
possible task, the shrapnel of the en
emy decimating the advancing ranks,
whole companies withering under the
terrific fire, and our men were com
pelled to abandon the attempt.
"Later in the day a similar fate be
fell three of our batteries. They had â¢
advanced behind our Infantry to pave
the way for an attack on the Japanese j
position, but the infantry was forced J
back, the artillerymen were almost all
killed and the guns remained alone.
The Japanese made a desperate ad- j
vance In the hope of securing the guns, |
but each time were driven off. and to- j
ward nightfall we removed the guns '
safely. 1
"The struggle was resumed to-day at
daybreak, with every promise of an
other day of stubborn combat. It Is
now the sixth day of fighting unprece
dented in "history for the stubbornness
and tenacity shown by both sides.

below Mukden says:
"The center column, after defeating
the enemy posted on the eminences
south of Ehohopu, seized the positions
which he had been holding.
VICTORY AIX AIXDNG THE LINE.
"A. portion of the center column
which was directed against Llnchen
pao, co-operating with a portion of
the left column, fought a fierce battle
and at 4 o'clock in the afternoon
stormed and captured Llnchenpao.
Our force* are now chasing the ene
my.
"The Russian force holding LJn
chenpao consisted of over a regiment
of infantry, with two batteries of ar
tillery, and this force is now retreat
ing toward Sugangtai. where the Rus
sians are halting. A portion of the
center column Is pursuing the enemy
toward Yuboyun.
"The forces of the enemy opposing
the left wing of the left army at
Changllargpo and neighborhood,
where the left column was engaging
them, gradually obtained reinforce
ments and at 3 o'clock in the after-
"A body of our supports which had
been driving a small force of the ene
my before it since the morning of the
14 th took possession of Waitao Moun
tain. Observing that the enemy, from
the movement of his wagon column.
was commencing a retreat, this body
of our supports Immediately pursued
him. sending a portion of its detach
ment to Chingtuitzu.
"Center army â After attacking and
dislodging the forces of the enemy,
which were holding Changllntzu. Put
saowa. Tungehafen and the vicinities
of these places, the center army has
been driving them north to the Shakhe
River since the morning of October
14 and has reached and now holds a
line on the river.
"Left army â The main strength oÂ£
the right column of this army was di
rected against Huangchiatlea. It
drove the enemy northward and at 1
o'clock on the afternoon of October
14 It mastered the heights in that vi
cinity.
"The enemy opposing the left col
umn was about one division strong
and fled In confusion toward Fenhips.
His artillery is still holding a posi
tion near Ta Pass and Is bombarding
us.
"The right column of the army, which
had been engaging the enemy near
Chaohsin Pass, observing that the en
pmy showed signs of retreat. Imme
diately pave chase toward Taichaiku,
while the center and left columns, co
operating, attacked the forces of the
enemy which were occupying positions
near SIku Mountain and defeated them.
These columns Immediately advanced
to a line on the Shakhe River.
SLAVS HOLD TA PASS.
'â¢Right armyâ The force of the enemy
which opposed the right flank of the
right army, holding the vicinities of
Tumln and Ta passes, and engaged our
detachment which was sent to Bensihu
Â¦was unable to keep Its ground on Octo
ber 14, and showed signs of retreat.
The commander of the army then or
dered the Bensihu detachment to hotly
pursue the enemy toward the east and
north. This detachment Immediately
formed itself into two detachments and
pursued the enemy toward Pintaitzu
and the Shakhe River, driving the en
tmy before them. The enemy", who had
retreated, stopped at Pieniuhungpo and
is fortifying that place.
Lengthy reports from the field re
ceived to-day and published this even
ing are as follows:
Thus the object of the enemy has
been completely frustrated and his of
fensive movement has ended In final
failure. The corpses left by the enemy
at dlSerert points are too numerous to
be easily counted. The trophies, besides
the guns. Include an enormous quan
tity of ammunition, wagons and rifles.
These are still uncounted.
PURSUIT OF THE RUSSIANS.
The guns captured nmnber more than
eighty and the prisoners taken number
several hundred.
The fighting continued all along the
entire line to-day, and the end is not
near. It seems to be impossible for the
Russians to rally, and they probably
will be pressed back across the Hun
River.
TOKIO, Oct. 15.â General Kuropat
kin's southern advance has been beaten
back and his array is in retreat. He is.
however, etill doggedly fighting to pre
vent an utter rout.
Field Marshal Oyaina's triumphant
troops have driven the Russians north
to a line along the Shakhe River. They
are vigorously pressing the pursuit and
probably will inflict still more severe
damage on Kuropatkln's forces.
As a result of the bloody -battle of
October 14 the Russians left 2000 dead
on the field. Field Marshal Oyama esti
mates the Russian losses at more than
30.000.
LONDON. Oct. 15. â A dlsatch to a
news agency from Toklo, dated to-day.
Bays that as the result of Friday's
sanguinary fighting the center column
of the Japanese left army succeeded
in partly occupying Shohopu. The
Russian main body fell back on the
mountainous districts of the railway.
The Russians around Bensihu have
fled in a northeasterly direction.
The Japanese last night, the dis
patch adds, engaged three Russian re
serve divisions under the personal
command of General Kuropatkin. The
fighting in this quarter was resumed
this morning.
Vital Importance Is attached at To
kio to the engagement at this point.
Awful Slaughter on the
Sixth Day of the
Battle,

Improvement by "humanized radium" Is a

and 1 Fourth st.
"REXRADIO" never prescribes medicine, and j
the only guarantee he will give Is that If
first treatment falls to help you It is abso-
lutely "free." Can anything be fairer?
"REXRADIO'S" very first treatment often
beneflts. but the Increase and permanence of
the benefit If possible, depends on a few
further daily treatments regularly taken.
"REXRADIO" indorsed by "city physician"
at public meeting. He said, "I saw him
greatly benefit several chronic cases In my
offices. I strongly recommend him." (Name
at offices.)
" 'REXRADIO' in only 8 seconds made my 30
S-ears' 'totally' deaf ear clearly hear distant
'whispered' sentences In view of audience.
Interview me." â Mr. B.. 632 Market office 11
" 'REXRADIO' quickly cured my large stom- J
ach 'cancer.' It soon dried up and was ab-
sorbed. Can't now see or feel slightest sign
of It. Am the most grateful man in city." â
H. C. Knott. 112 FelU
" 'REXRADIO' tn few seconds 'publicly*
quickened my long "paralyzed" limb; Instant-
ly I walked, ran and 'leaped' easily from
the floor. See me."â K. Hall. 17 4th. r. 5.
" 'REXRADIO'S' brief treatment subdued my
â¢heart" affection, palpitated violently, ir-
regularly, missing beats: now regular, nat-
ural, no missing beats."â J. Little. 201 Hyde.
"REXRADIO," before many. Including Mr.
Butler, representative of "S. F. Chronicle."
by one. brief treatment caused "deaf mute"
to clearly hear and Intelligibly speak sen-
tences and numerous words. Over 20 of audi-
ence each spoke to patient, who promptly
heard and repeated their words. * (Bring
tome "deaf mutes" Sunday .healing meeting.)
"REXRADIO" made a second "deaf mute"
beirin to hear and speak (precisely as In
above case) In a local "physician's" office.
"RUXRADIO'S" first short treatment marvel-
ously benefited the disabled limb of Mrs.
Bruce Lee (Lick House), well known to all
"Freemasons" as the honored widow of
Cal. "Grand Commander of Knights Tem-
plar." The limb was In a dangerous state,
greatly inflamed. Immensely swollen. First
treatment reduced -inflammation and swell-
Ing, and after the third the Inflammation '
was entirely gone and the limb of natural
size. REXRADIO presents this pleasing In-
cident to the fraternal notice of his brother
"Mason*. "
" 'REXRADIO'S' single treatment subdued
my 'locomotor ataxia,' 7 years 'bedfast' :
couldn't move limbs, stand, 'lifted' from and
into bed. Right away I moved legs freely,
rose from bed and "stood' unaided. No re-
lapse in weeks, still Improving. See me." â
Stuart, Â«92% Capp (rear).
"OSSIFIED'* lady. Joints firmly grown to^
gether. "Immovable." One treatment In-
stantly Joints freed, moved naturally. Years
"bedfast." helpless, lifted from, into bed.
Now rose unaided, seated herself in chair.
Can now cook. etc.. still Improving. Wishes
to see you. â Mrs. Knowles, 379 Bartlett.
" 'REXRADIO" went with me see sadly af-
flicted 'bedfast' man, full of pain, helpless,
couldn't rise from bed or move limbs several
years. I saw the (one) treatment and pa-
tient astonished me by rising (unassisted)
from bed and walking; limbs had largely re-
gained normal power; severe pains suddenly
ceased. Chance was so great and quick It

tion to meet Mrs. Hugh Tevis, the
wealthy widow, when she arrived from
New York yesterday. London society
sympathizes with his lordship's addi
tional failure to capture the American
fortune, for Mrs. Tevis has returned to
London contingently engaged to Hart'
McKee, the New Yorker, who escorted
her across the ocean.
At Claridge8 Mrs. Tevis denied her
self to all callers, but she and McKee
shopped together all morning and in
the afternoon went off to Parisl It is
understood that they will be. married,
however, as soon as McKee's | divorce
docree is made absolute, as the*Erig-
Hsh .law requires only six weeks'* resi
dence, while the French law requires
six months.
