SLAUGHTER AT PORT ARTHUR
Men Fall by Hundreds
on the Ramparts.
Trenches Filled With Dead
Failure of Japanese
General Assault.
Hand to Hand Fighting
The following graphic story of the general assault on
Port Arthur tells of the desperate attempts made by the
Japanese to take the fortress. Driven back by showers of
shot and shell, they fought like demons until the trenches
were filled with the dead and dying. The loss of life was
appalling.
HEADQUARTERS OF THE JAP
ANESE THIRD ARMY. BEFORE
PORT ARTHUR. Nov. 28, via Tien
tsin, December 9 (Probably held at
headquarters for censorship). â The
general assault on Port Arthur, which
began at noon on November 26, is still
in progress. In the first series of as
saults an attempt was made to cap
ture the forts on Rihlung and Kek
v.-cn mountains by penetrating the
principal line of fortifications . sur
rounding them and to envelop the
city from the east. At the same time
a strong force pushed up the gorge of
the Shuishi Valley, between the two
fortified ridges, and attacked the sup
porting fort in the rear of West Rih
lung Mountain, officially called Sung-
Fhu Mountain, with the intention of
erveloping the city from the west.
The attempt failed after the most
furious fighting, that has been wit
nessed since Port Arthur was invested.
The fighting lasted from noon of No
wember 26 until after dawn of the
following day without cessation.
The assault began early in the
morning with a tremendous bombard
ment of the forts on the western half
cf the eastern fortified ridge by tc bat-
tery, which had been placed in posi
tion on the crest of a ridge to the rear.
For hours the whole -western half of
the fortlSed ridge was deluged with
heavy shells. At noon the principal
line of fortifications was a perfect hell
of bursting shrapnel and the spectacle
was more wonderful than anything
previously seen.
The front lines of infantry, having
been strongly reinforced, began an at
tack simultaneously along the entire
line from East Kekwan Mountain to
West Rihlung Mountain. Through the
haze caused by the smoke of the burst-
Ing shells the assaulters could be seen
emerging from the cover of the
parallels, as well as swarming up the
fortified ridge at half a dozen differ
ent points.
MEN" FALL BY HUNDREDS.
Rifles, rapid-fire guns and machine
guns blazed from the Russian posi
tions, where advances were made in
the open. The men went down by
hundreds. The forts were belching
smoke and bursting shells and the
ramnart walls were black with as
saulters, who on reaching the crests
met with an awful flre from within
the forts, which swept down line after
line of Japanese.
As fast as the assaults were repulsed
more Japanese swarmed up, only to
be mowed down in turn.
The determination ana fury of the
Japanese assaults were equaled by the
stubbornness of the resistance of the
Russians.
On the eastern extremity of the line
the Japanese made an assault in an
attempt to capture the Russian
trenches situated midway on the slope
of East Kekwan Mountain. The Jap
anese paralleled some thirty yards of
the Russian trench line and an entire
regiment charged across, the men fall-
Ing by hundreds before the awful flre
of the Russians. But Btill more men
came on over the bodies of those who

the eale of Jewels, laces, furs and other
personal belongings of the late Mrs.
Charles L. Fair. The objects offered
were most varied In character and
ranged from cigarette cases to apostle

Seme of the handsomest sliver pieces

had fallen, and by sheer weight of
numbers they reached .the trenches,
which they captured at the point of the
bayonet.
The Russian shrapnel fire made the
captured section of the trenches a per
fect hell, while the Japanese shrapnel
flre assisted the. captors to push east
and west along the trench line.
The assaulters succeeded in holding
some eighty yards of the trench in
front of the parallels, but their efforts
to rush the trench line east and west
was a failure, owing ' to Impassable
burning pits which filled the whole
space of the trench on the northern
side, as well as to the fact that their
progress was barred by the flre of the
Russian machine guns. s
DEAD FILL THE TRENCHES.
The Japanese built traverse walls
across the trench under the protection
of their machine guns and tried to cross
the pits, but they were unable to do so.
At 6 o'clock in the evening a furious
Russian counter-attack drove the Jap
anese back to the parallels with great
loss.
At 9 o'clock the Japanese again cap
tured the same portion- of the trench
and made .desperate but unsuccessful
Â«n*Â«rts to cross the pits. â ' ' - - ~..~
The awful struggle continued until 2
o'clock in the morning, when the Rus
sians again counter-attacked and re
captured the trench which was piled
with dead bodies. For over thirty
yards between the trenches there was
a veritable shambles. The last attacks
and counter-attacks were made over
the bodies of the slain.
The flrst attempt to rush the fort
on the northern part of Kekwan
Mountain was made at 1 o'clock ; in
the afternoon, when the assaulters
swarmed up the rampart wall from
the moat and met with an awful fire
from within and from the Chinese
wall in the rear of the fort. When the
Russians saw that it was the intention
of the Japanese to rush the fort they
moved a considerable force from the
Chinese wall into a gorge to the east
and to the rear of the fort. During
the fotfr or five assaults which the
Japanese made upon the fort some of
the garrison attempted to evacuate
the fort over the rear ramparts, but
they were fired upon by the Russian
force in the gorge.
FAIL TO RUSH THE FORT.
As the result of the flrjt assault the
rampart walls were black with bodies.
In the second assault the Japanese
succeeded in gaining a foothoM in thÂ«Â»
interior, where the defenses were
bomb-proof, with raised lines of pro
tected trenches in the rear of the fort,
where the machine guns swept the
front of the fort and the walls.
The assaulters attacked this bomb
proof maze, where the fighting was
hand-to-hand with bayonets and gren
ades.
The Japanese mounted six moun
tain guns on an intrenched hill called
"P" fort. Immediately to the west, in
an endeavor to silence the fire of the
Maxim guns, but they were unsuccess

SOCIALIST
ARRAIGNS
VON BULOW
Objects to Attitude, ol
Chancellor Toward
Russia,
Says Germany Has Chosen
Inopportune Moment to
Increase Army.
BERLIN, Dec. 9. â Herr von Volmar.
Socialist, relieved Herr Bebel. the So
cialist leader, to-day, in the assault
upon the Government. At the conclu
sion of a long speech sharply arraign
ing Chancellor von Bulow for his.al
leged overfriendly attitude toward
Russia, Von Voltmar took up Emperor
William's telegrams referring to the
one sent to President Roosevelt. He
said:
"In coolness of telegram style we
could learn something from the Ameri
cans. The dispatch Is in one respect
nyt without advantage for Germany,
since the empire's head in a telegram
to President Roosevelt did not address
him personally, but expressed his ad
miration of the United States.".
Von Volmar in the earlier part of
his speech pointed out that the Govern
ment had chosen an inopportune mo
ment to increase^ the army. "Russia,"
he continued, "is so crippled from a
military and moral sense that there
can arise no question of danger on the
eastern frontier for a long time, and
Europe is thereby relieved of an enor
mous burden, and Russia's defeat has
given a severe blow, to France's | pol
icy of revenge.
"It would be a crime to advise Ger
mans to lend money to Russia under
the present circumstances, and it would
be a breach of neutrality if Germany
allows the new Russian fleet to be built
here.';. . - ,._â¢ . v'"l..^ ' â -.:... â -.â â â 
'Referring to Von Bulow's words â¢ in
reply to Bebel, Von Volmar expressed
amazement at the fact that "anybody
can call the struggle against Russian
despotism a crime. It is only explica
ble through our deep-seated sub
servience and subjection to Russia."
The Socialists loudly applauded the
speaker's remark that the "Chancel
lor's policy toward Russia is a rein
surance against democracy."
Quoting Von Bulow's complaint that
the Socialists wanted to overthrow the
existing order of things In Russia, Von
Volmar turned to the Chancellor and
said:
"Yes, Mr. Chancellor of the empire,
that is what we wish to do, and we
have all Europe as our accomplices."
This statement was greeted with tre
mendous and long applause from the
Left.
The Chancellor showed evident re
spect for his antagonist, who is a Ba
varian nobleman and still betrays the
effects of a wound received during
the Franco-Prussian war. The Chan
cellor referred to Von Volmar's "chiv
alrous defense of Herr Bebel" and
defended the Government's policy to
ward Russia. He asserted that it was
one of strict neutrality, correspond
ing with the traditional attitude of
Germany toward the Russian empire,
and regretted that the Socialists treat
ed Russian relations wholly from the
standpoint of a political party, just as
many Germans gave vent to their
feelings during the Boer war to exer
cise the ostensible and moral right to
criticize foreign affairs.
"The German," he continued, "has
an unfortunate sympathy for an' un
fortunate land."
RACING MAY BE STOPPED
BY MISSOURI LiEGISIiATURE
Governor-Elect Folk Is Quoted as
Saying He Will Urge Repeal
of the Present Law.
ST. LOUIS, Dec. 9.â Governor-elect
Joseph L. Folk is quoted to-day in the
Chronicle, which has Joined the Post-
Dispatch in making a fight on horse
racing in Missouri, as stating that he
will urge the repeal of the Missouri
breeder's law and the wiping out of
horse racing in this State in his first
message to the Legislature.
In reply, to letters and telegrams
asking them what attitude they will
take on the question of repealing the
breeder's law of 1896, under which horse
racing is legalized in Missouri, twenty
eight newly elected members of the As
sembly stated to-day they would heart
ily favor the repeal of the law. About
as many more replied they wished time
to consider the issue. Not one Repre
sentative nor Senator was wiUing to
go on record as being opposed to the
repeal of the breeder's law. The fight
between the Unipn Jockey Club and
the Western Jockey Club has had much
to do with causing the present condi
tion of affairs.
NEW ORLEANS, Dec. 9.â It Is the
general impression among the horse
men here that President Bush and the
other officers of the -Crescent City
Jockey Club are badly frightened at
the rumpus which has been stirred up
by the Western Jockey Club in turning
down the request of the rival of the
Crescent City Club for dates.
President Bush is saying "No revi
sion" to his friends, but at the same
time it is known that leaders in the
councils of the Crescent Jockey Club
held a number of conferences behind
closed doors. It Is reported here that
it was the decision 'of several of the
largest stockholders of the Crescent
City Club that things had been carried
with too high a hand, and that it might
not be a bad thing to recede from their
original position. Â» President :Heasllp of
the New -Orleans Jockey Club says no
further steps will be taken, in its fight
until â¢ Mr. Corrlgan. returns from Kan
sas City. :. \

Mrs. cnaawick Still
Behind Boors o!
Priin.
Will Not Go Voluntarily to
Cleveland to Face Her
Accusers.
Special Dl6patcH;to The Call.
NEW YORK, Dec' 9.-^After. having
announced her intention , to waive ex
amination here and return at once to
Cleveland to face > her accusers, Mrs.
Cassie L. Chadwick changed her mind
late this afternoon 'and ' decided to
spend another night in her-cell in the
Tombs. Her attorneys did not know
to-night what her plans! would be.
Every possibility, of obtaining bail here
appears to have beenexhausted. Where
a few months ago'she secured sums ap
proaching millions from banker friends,
she is now unable to get the few thou
sands which would unlock her prison
doors. 'â >
It Is because of the sentiment against
her in Cleveland that her attorney
there, a one-time lav.' partner, of Wil
liam McKinley, advised her by tele
graph to-day under no | circumstances
to think of leaving New York. for the
present, even though , she \ meanwhile
has to remain In prison. Her attorneys
here, Philip Carpenter, and, Edmond W..
Powers, also urged her to remain, and
finally, apparently against her own will
and judgment, she yielded to r their ad
vice and at the last moment notified
United States Marshal Henkel . that ; he
need make no further/ preparations to
take her away. This was Rafter.;, the
train had jbeen \ selected " onVwhiibht she
.was ,to â¢ be taken awajiju^der chargetof
a**de*pQly" > marsHal. ;"â '.*'.'" " .^"^'.^\'^
She succeeded in almost exhausting
the patience of 'the Federal officials,
who have gone far out of their, way to
extend courtesies to her. For hours she
kept Marshal Henkel, United States
Commissioner Shields and Assistant
United States District Attorney'Bald
win waiting for her decision whether
she would or would not waive exam
ination and go to Cleveland under ar
rest. â¢V"'
With the suspense ended as to her
possible arrest, Mrs. Chadwick ap
peared to recover her spirits and was
in much better physical and mental
condition to-day. She spent a rest
less night, but was able in the moraine
to eat the most of a special breakfast
ordered from the "Tombs Delmonlco."
Her other meals during the day were
equally satisfactory to her. and at mid
night to-night she was reported as
sleeping peacefully.
Mrs. Chadwlck's day began with the
prison call of "All up" at half-past
6 o'clock. The matron went to her to
explain the . prison regulations and
found her* dressing and apparently
much Improved both In mind and body.
After breakfast her flrst callers were
Lawyers Carpenter and Powers, who
had to tell her that the possibility of
obtaining- bail seemed as remote as
ever.
Mrs. Chadwick has several times la
mented the taking of her little medi
cine chest from her when she entered
the prison, but so far as can be learned
It contained nothing except harmless
drugs. Warden Flinn is taking no
chances on the possibility that his
prisoner may do herself bodily harm.
So fearful is he that in desperation she
may try to end her troubles that he
has taken the unusual precaution of
having her constantly watched by a
woman attendant, who Is Instructed not
to let Mrs. Chadwick out of her slcht
for a single minute. He has also had
the knives and forks taken/ from her
tray when meat is sent to her cell, so
that she had to have her chops cut ud
for her, and a spoon was the only uten
sil that she had to use.
FDAW IN HER MARRIAGE.
Name in Plttsburjr Ceremony Said to
Hnvo Been Twisted.
PITTSBURG, Dec. 9.â There is evi
dence that there was a scheme by
which a marriage, seemingly bogus,
was part of the game by which cer
tain Plttsburg business men dropped
$300,000 to the woman now In jail
in New York and Dr. L. S. Chadwick.
That the marriage in Pittsburg of Mrs.
Cassie L. Hoover and - Dr. Leroy S.
Chadwick was no marriage at all, and
that unless the reported Canadian
marriage was better than the Pitts
burg affair Mrs. Chadwick has no
right to the name, is the opinion of
many of the best attorneys , of Pitts
burg, who have lately become familiar
with the case.
When Dr. Leroy S. Chadwick. and
Mrs.) Cassie L. Hoover stood â¢ up in
front of Rev. A. H. Jolly to be mar
ried they had > no marriage license.
They handed the minister a license is
sued to VLeroy S. Schadwlck and Mrs.
Cassie L. â¢ Hoover." It . was plainly
written by Dr. Chadwick himself.
Dr. Chadwick has not yet taken out
any license to marry Mrs. Hoover in
Pennsylvania. Whether; or not It was
necessary for her , in carrying out her
plans here to show herself -a mar
ried woman and that she hastily fixed
up the deal with the Cleveland. physi
cian, who agreed 'to "go through the
ceremony with her under a doctored
name, is now, a question. ;

"Mrs. Chadwick's illness is. one of
the ruses which the Devere woman
manipulated to secure her parole from

served a few years of her sentence
she convinced a lot of people that she

time to live.' Because of this many
people signed a petition to the Board
of Pardons to parole her. She was
finally paroled.
"During all the time she has. been
out of the Ohio penitentiary she has,
under the law, been obliged to re

managed to prevent the fact that she

PRICE FIVE CENTS.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Dec. 9.â Suit has been
begun by H. J. Thaddeus. a portrait
painter, against Mrs. Katherine Clem
mor.s Gould, wife of Howard Gould, for
$5000, the contract price, the artist as
serts, for a full length portrait of Mrs.
Gould, ordered by herself and begun a
year ago. The portrait in question is
completed and now stands in the studio
of Thaddeus in West Thirty-Third
street. He declares that after several
sittings Mrs. Gould abandoned her
project. Harris, Corwln, Gunnison and
Meyers. who represent Thaddeus.
served the complaint a week asro. to
which Abraham Hummell. attorney for
Mrs. Gould, has made answer.
The artist declares the picture was
ordered and sittings begun for it when
suddenly Mrs. Gould changed her mind
apparently and would not appear for
her engagements at his studio. For
three weeks, he continues, appointments
for sittings were made almost every
day, only to be broken by telegrams.
If appointments were for 11 o'clock in
the morning at 1 o'clock a telegram
would arrive. "Cannot come to-day;
will be there to-morrow at 3." An en
gagement would be made for that hour
and then would come another messasre
on the following day. "Will be down
to-morrow at 11 o'clock." Thaddeus
waited, and as nothing further devel
oped he brought suit.
Mrs. Gould in her answer sets ud
several reasons why the portrait should
never adorn Ca3tle Gould on Lone
Island. In the flrst place she declares
the artist has gone ahead with the por
trait without having had sittings suf
ficient to guarantee a likeness. In the
next place, he has failed to catch the
likeness; third, he has her wearlnz &
gown in the portrait which she does cot
like; fourth, the artist himself spoiled
the very thing for which the portrait
was intended. It was to have been a
surprise for Gould â a present â and
about the flrst thing Thaddeus did
when he had an opportunity was to
tell Gould all about it.

Slaughter at Port Arfflur.
Contlnued From Page 1. Column 2.
Japanese succeeded In establishing a
trench lino inside the ramparts, which
ihev still hold.
The first sections of the maze of
bombproofs were smashed and piled
â with the bodies of the dead of both
rides.
The ettempt to rush the interior of
the fort proved a failure, but portions
of the fort were temporarily occupied.
The defenders were annihilated or
were unable or unwilling to retire and
lous:ht to the last breach.
In the meantime a strong force of
Japanese attempted to pierce the line
of works east of the fort, but they
were unable to make progress.
It was marvelous how the Russians
v.eie able to strengthen their lines of
defence at the uoints of attack.
Another attempt was made to pierce
the principal line of fortifications sur
rounding the rear of the eastern part
of Panlung Mountain, where after four
furious attempts a small body of Japa
nese succeeded in getting through the
wall and in establishing themselves on
the lower slopes of Wantai Hill. The
liusfians rushed the eupports with ma
chine guns from the upper slopes of the
Wantai Hill forts, and the small party
of Japanese was practically anni
hilated. The most desperate fighting
took place at this point.
USE DYNAMITE GRENADES.
The laet effort of the assaulters was
made at midnight, assisted by artil
lery, which covered the slopes of Wan
tai Hill with an avalanche of shells.
The Russians fought with tremendous
ccuragr\ engaging the Japanese with
bayonets and grenades when they came
to close quarters. Th? Japanese finally
established a trench line five yards in
front of the line of fortifications, which
they now occupy. The forces are en
gaged in throwing dynamite grenades
at each other.
In the first assault against the fort
en the eastern part of Rihlung Moun
tain the Japanese were unable to gain a
foothold, though their artillery made
the interior fortF a seething caldron of
bursting shells. A 6trong force of Japa
nese worked up from the parallels in

the gorge between the fort hill and
Hachimakijama and Intrenched on the
hill in an effort to assist the assaulters
of the fort, who were attacking it from
the rear, and met with a terrible fire
from the outer works and with shrap
nel from a ridge in the rear. A small
party, of Japanese gained a roadway
leading to the rear of the fort, but was
forced to retire.
The attempts which were first made
to rush the western part. of Rihlung
Mountain, officially called Sungshu
Mountain, also ended in failure. The
Japanese reached the parapets from
the moat, but fled as fast as they came
under the fire from within the fortf
The walls were black with the assault
ers, who were deluged with shells from
the fort on Antse Mountain, across the
gorge of the Shulshi Valley, between
the two fortified ridges and from a fort
Immediately In the rear called the sup
porting fort of Sungshu Mountain.
IIAN'D-TO-HAN'D ENCOUNTERS.
At 9 o'clock at night a force of 2000
volunteers from the right division, led
by a general, started from a point
Eouthwest of Shulshi village.- pushed
up the gorge between the two fortified
ridges and attacked the supporting fort
of Sungshu Mountain, which is a short
distance outside the western confines
of Port Arthur, with the Intention of
enveloping the city from the west, and
also for the purpose of assisting the as
saulters of the two Rihlung Mountain
forts. This force reached the fort hill
and engaged a strong force of Russians
upon its slopes in a hand-to-hand en
counter, which lasted for two hours.
At the same time the Japanese as
saulting the east and west Rlhlung
forts made desperate attempts to rush
the interior of tha forts. They gained
the ramparts, inside which they estab
lished trench fines.
The Interior defenses of both forts are
the same as those on North Keekwan
Mountain, but the east Rihlung fort is
the largest and strongest of the three
forts. It has upper and lower levels.
The two lower levels were the scene
of the most awful struggle, which last
ed from 10 o'clock until midnight. Un
der cover of darkness Japanese
poured over the ramparts andturiously
attacked the first section of bomb
proofs. The defenders received them
with bayonets and dynamite grenades,
while the machine guns on the upper
levels poured a deadly hall into the
ranks of the Japanese.
The struggle was absolutely hand-to
hand. The defenders of the greater
part of the bombproofs on the lower
levels of the fort were annihilated, and
the sections and cross-sections of the
bombproofs were piled with corpses.
MOWED DOWN BY SLAVS.
The Japanese gained practically the
whole of the lower section of the fort,
but were mowed down by . machine
guns and rifles when they attempted to
assault the higher levels.
For an hour before midnight the
Japanese artillery Ehelled the higher
levels, while the Russian guns shelled
the lower levels.
A similar struggle was going on all
the time in the west Rihlung fort,
where the arrangement of the defenses
wes the same.
At 11 o'clock a desperate effort was
made by the Japanese to push a' force
up the gorge between the east Rihlung
fort^and Hachimakijama to assist the
assaulters against the supporting fort
of Sungshu Mountain, *. but again and
again this force was repulsed by the
Russians behind the works and by -the
guns on the ridge behind the fort.
At midnight the column attacking the
supporting fort of Sungshu Mountain
was compelled to retire, having lost
half the force. ' i
The struggle in "the two fc-rts was
continued until dawn, when the as-
THE, SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY. DECEMBER 10. 1901
GENERAL OKU DRIVES
THE RUSSIANS OUT OF
THE ISLAND OF GUSHAN
Slavs Are Forced
to Leave Guns
Benind.
LONDON, Dec. 10.â The Daily Tele
graph's Tientsin correspondent reports
that General Oku, after a tlrree days'
artillery engagement drove the Rus
sians on Sunday out of the small lofty
island of Gushan in the river ten miles
below Llaoyangr- The Russians, It is
added, abandoned a quantity of sup
plies and several guns and retired to
a position eight miles northwest,
whence they heavily bombarded the
Japanese, setting fire to kerosene depots
and causing a great conflagration
which did not cease until Wednesday.
The Japanese are still gallantly holding
the island with a handful of men. Their
casualties, it Is alleged, number 5000.
According to the Morning Post's
Shanghai dispatch the Japanese forces
with the exception of those manning
the forts have already retreated to
Laote mountains.
Details continue to filter in of the
capture of 203 Meter hill. The Daily
Telegraph's correspondent before PoTt
jVrthur explains that the capture' was
due to a strong feint against the east
ern fortifications on the night of De
cember 6, which the position of 2C3
Meter hill, being an enfilading one,
forced the Russians to evacuate with
out a contest, to a parallel line of semi
permanent defenses extending east
ward and irregularly over the slopes
within a half-mile no^th of Etse Moun
tain.
The Japanese casualties at 203 Meter
hill alone exceeded the total of the bat
t'e of Nanshan, according to the Daily
Mail's Tokio dispatches. At 2 o'clock
in the afternoon of November 29 a To
mnyasu detachment with a battalion of
Infantry a,nd a company of engineers
received orders that they must cap
ture 203 Meter hill while a Yosid de
tachment of the same strength had
similar orders to capture Akasaka hill.
On November 30 it became necessary to
reinforce the attackers with a detach
ment under Major Shizuta. During the
operation the cold was so intense that
many of the men were frostbitten, as it
was necessary to pass the night with
out shelter. The Japanese after the cap
ture of 203 Meter hill anticipated a
terrible bombardment from the Russian
forts and made preparations according
ly, but the Russians remained strange
ly Quiet.
The same correspondent says that the
Russians at Port Arthur on December
7 resumed mine clearing operations,
presumably to enable the torpedo boat
destroyers to attempt to escape and
join the Baltic squadron.

saulters were compelled to retire to" the

walls which they now occupy.
The fighting all the afternoon and
night was the most desperate and san
guinary since the siege began. The op
posing forces â¢ were so close together
that only the fort walls or a- few yards
of level ground separated* them, The
struggle'from start to finish was at
close quarters, with bayonets and gren
ades and rifles used as clubs. The fero
city of the attacking . Japanese , -was
equaled by the defending Russians, who
died at their posts everywhere, fighting
till their last breath.

reigned, and the silence duringthe day

Disabled Russian
Fleet at Mercy
of Enemy.
TOKIO, Dec. 9.â Since the taking of
203 Meter Hill it has been possible to
accurately find the range of the bat
tleships in the harbor of Port Arthur.
The bombardment of the Russian fleet
has thus been made effective from va
rious points apart from the hill Itself.
It is â¢ believed that before lonpr every
torpedo boat destroyer, merchantman
and transport in the harbor will be
sunk. Only the Sevastopol of the Rus
sian battleshiDs remain above water.
Eight . destroyers are still untouched.
It is said that the strength of the gar
rison does not exceed 6000. The Jap
anese papers make no secret of the Joy
over the recent successes at Port Ar
thur.
The following report, dated December
8, 10 p. m., has been received from the
commander of the naval land batteries
in front of Port Arthur:
"Eight shells struck the protected
cruiser Pallada to-day and set her on
fire. Simultaneously .she besaii to list
to port, lowering astern. She is deemed
unfitted for navigation.
"During the action we discovered the
gunboat Giliak to the landward north
of the battleship Peresviet and bom
barded v^ier. Eleven of our shells were
effective. This vessel is also deemed
to be disabled.
"The hits made by our naval and
siege guns to-day total twenty-two.
The armored cruiser Bayan caught fire
at 11:30 o'clock this morning and the
fire was not extinguished at 4:15 in the
afternoon. Evidently the cruiser is se
riously damaged."
Another report from the same com
mander, dated at 3 o'clock this (Fri
day) morning, is as follows:
"As the result of our naval gun bom
bardment yesterday (Thursday) the
Bayan was hit six times and the Amur
fourteen times. The Amur is sinking
astern.
"Our cannonade directed against the
storehouses and arsenals at the north
east base of Paiyu Mountain resulted
In thirty-eix hits, causing great
damage.
In disabling the Russian fleet at Port
Arthur, precluding the possibility of
its being able to reinforce the Russian
Second Pacific squadron, the Japanese
have accomplished the main object of
the desperate assaults, against the
fortress which they have been making
for the past three months. There is
now a strong probability that, while
continuing the siege, they will avoid
losses of the magnitude already attend
ing their efforts, and. instead of as
saulting, will rely on starving out the
garrison until it Is finally captured. '
RUSSIAN'S ARE SILENT.
Do Not Reply to Plre^of Japanese on
. . . . the Port Arthur. Fleet. i-
r TOKIO, Dec- 9/8 p. m.â The latest ob
servations of the Japanese commanders
In front of Port Arthur show that there
is no activity in the west harbor or in
the visible portions of the east harbor.
The Russians, strangely, are not reply
ing to the Japanese fire.
.Considerable astonishment is ex
pressed here over the fact that the
Russians in no .way resisted the dis
abling of the Port Arthur fleet. In cer
tain quarters the opinion is entertained
that the Russians opened the seacocks
of the submerged vessels, so as to
lessen their exposure to the -Japanese
fire.
There was no sign of life on the Rus
sian ships during the bombardment,
and from this fact it is concluded that
the blue jackets took refuge on land
or that they are engaged in the land
defenses.
. With the Russian second Pacific
squadron approaching, those *in Toklo
cannot comprehend the failure of the
Russians to die hard and to inflict all
possible damage on the Japanese fleet,
even at the cost of weakening the ef
fective garrison.
Now that the Port Arthur fleet has
been disabled, it is deemed impossible
for the Russians to overcome the in
feriority ot the second Pacific squad
ron to Togo's fleet, unless, at present
unforeseen, the Black Sea fleet should
pass the Dardanelles.

A recommendation to petition Con
gress to enact a law compelling vessels
carrying United States mail to carry 75
per cent American citizens in their

Fruit Growers Outline Plans
LOCAL FRUIT MARKETING EXPERT RECENTLY RETURNED FROM A EURO
PEAN TRIP. WHO TESTERDAT DELIVERED AN ABLE ADDRESS BEFORE
THE FRCIT GROWERS' CONVENTION IN THE GARDEN CITY.
Â£pÂ«cl&l Dloatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE. Dec. 9.â Another attempt
to organize the prune growers of the
State will be made, in the hope that the
industry can be placed on a paying
basis and a good market secured and
retained. This action was favored this
afternoon at the meeting of the State
fruit growers' convention. The plan
came before the convention In the
shape of the following resolution, which
was submitted by A. R. Sprague of the
committee on co-operation:
Resolved. That the Commissioners of Hor
ticulture be req lifted to nubmlt by mall to
th-r pruno growers of the State a referendum
a>klmr for their vote: First, for or aicainst
any plan of control of the marketing of the
prune crop: second, if in favor of such control
to vote for th* co-ODeratlve or the proflt
nharing plan submitted by the committee, or
DOAN"S PFLLS.
AWATUIRED,
Few San Francisco People Fiy
Understait the Cause.
/
That never-rested feeling.
Tired day and night.
Most time6 'tis the kidneys' fault.
Doan's Kidney Pills cure every
kidney ill.
Cure backache, urinary disorders,
diabetes.
Are indorsed in San Francisco.
Mrs. C. Demell (C. Demell em-
ployed on the wharf), residence n
Alaska place, says: "I have had
more or less trouble with my kidneys
for fifteen years, my back aching at
times so that I could neither sit, stand
or lie in any comfort. When in the
acute stage I had sinking spells, was
weak, lacked energy and often felt
as if I would totally collapse. If I
stooped for a few minutes when I re-
gained an upright position I grew so
dizzy I could scarcely stand, and, de-
j-pite the fact that I was continually
taking medicine from physicians and
using standard remedies, I grew worse
in place of better. I had very little
faith in Doan's Kidney Pills when I
first commenced their use, but after
a few days of the treatment they must
have acted on my nervous system as
'.veil as the kidneys, for I was able to
sleep at night peacefully â something
I had been unable to do for a long
time. I most heartily recommend
Doan's Kidney Pills."

If neither cf these pJanÂ» bÂ« Â»atlÂ«factory to In
dicate a plan which Is eatlifactory.
This resolution was unanimously
adopted.
The referendum will be submitted to
the prune growers by the Horticultural
Commissioners within a short time, and
if a satisfactory number of replies are
received a convention will be called,
probably in this city. Five years ago
at the fruit growers' convention In this
city plans of organization were ad
vanced which led to the formation of
the California Dried Fruit Association,
which because of mismanagement
proved a failure. With the experience
had, the men who are now favoring or
ganization believe the prune growers
can be successfully organized. The or
ganization of the prune growers that is
to be attempted Is by far the most Im
portant action taken by the conven
tion. There are 4000 prune growers in
the State.
WORDY WAR AVERTED.
There waa a good attendance at the
convention this morning. The first
thing before the convention was the fol
lowing resolutions, presented by A- N.
Judd of WatBonville, and which came
rear stirring up the' old question of
transportation :
Whereas. The California fruit growera' con
vention 1* fast becoming a misnomer, and In
asmuch as this convention at times has been
dominated by the Southern Pacific officials and
their adherents; and.
Whereas. By their votes and Influence you
have placed the fruit growers of the State of
California on record as favcring Armour pri
vate car lines, and. by inference, the Southern
Pacific Railroad Company in preference to
the Santa Fe, who own their own car lines;
and.
Whereas, The. packing of this convention
the officials and men dominated by the South
ern Pacific Railroad Company, without consent
of the fruit growers, thereby barring the privi
lege of a competing railroad (that the growers
have eo 16ng prayed for) to be represented in
our convention; and.
Whereas. By their acts in this convention
you have discredited your committee on trans
portation; therefore, be It
Resolved. That the said committee be dis
charged; and, be it further
Resolved, That in 1905 the fruit growers of
the State of California hold a convention of
their own and that no person be allowed to
take part Jn its deliberations only by request
of the chair, unless the perscn is a bona flde
fralt grower, and without any side Interests
that are Inimical to the grower.
A long and bitter wrangle seemed Im
minent. Edward Berwick of Pacific
Grove was on his feet at once to de
nounce' the resolutions, and John S.
Dore of Fresno "also attacked It. Presi
dent Cooper settled the threatened
wordy war by declaring that as the
resolutions were not before the house
all discussions were out of order.
ABLE PAPERS READ.
The regular programme of papers ar
ranged for the session was then taken
up. A paper on "Wine and the Grow
ing of Wine Grapes From the Pro
ducer's Standpoint," by W. J. Hotch
klss, was read by Secretary John Isaac.
Percy T. Morgan, president of the Cal
ifornia Wine Association, delivered an
address on "Native Wines and Their
Future." Albert Van der Naillen of San
Francisco addressed the convention on
the importance of making an exhibit
of California wine at the exposition to
be held In Belgium. Professor P. H.
Dorsett of the experimental station In
Chico read a paper on "What the Bu
reau of Plant Industry Is Doing for the
Fruit Grower," and â : Professor Warren
I. Clarke presented a paper on ''Aphlds
Attacking the Ap^ple.'*, ,
A very able address on "European
Markets for Callfornian Fruits" was
delivered by Allen G. Freeman of the
J. K. Armsby Company. Freeman has
spent the last nine: months in Europe
studying the markets for a wider dis
tribution of our products, and erave the
convention one of the best addresses of
the session.
LEGISLATION-. COMMITTEE.
A resolution passed last night
urging the Legislature to provide two

also asking for an - appropriation of

AWAIT ACTION
OF GRAND JDRY
Indictment of Young Weber
on Charge of Bobbing the
Bank Is Expected To-Day
DEFENSE HIBES SLEUTH
Detective, It Is Believed,
Has Been Betained to Im
peach Witnesses of State
Special Dispatch to The Call,
AUBURN, Dec. 9.â The Grand Jury
has not as yet returned an Indictment
charging Adolph Weber with robbing
the Placer County Bank. It is believed,
however, that the true bill will be forth
coming to-morrow. That Weber has
not been indicted cm the robbery charge
before this is due to the erroneous ad
vice given the Jury by District Attor
ney Robinson. This advice was to the
effect that the Jury, having indicted
Weber on one charge, could not Indict
him on another? advice due to Robin
son's wrong interpretation of the law,
declaring that a man could not be in
dicted twice for the same offense.
Next Monday Judge Prewett will set
the time for the trial of young Weber
on the charge of murdering his mother.
It is believed here that the defense
has secured the services of a detective
to impeach the testimony of the wit
nesses for the prosecution. This belief
is due to the presence in Auburn of a
stranger giving the name of Green, who
has during the last few days kept him
self busy interviewing those who testi
fied at the preliminary hearing of
Weber and the Coroner's Inquest.
Will Prosecute Weber.
In response to the requests of Gov
ernor Pardee. backed by the Board of
Supervisors of Placer County and
many prominent people from all over
the State, Attorney General Webb has
determined to take personal charge of
the prosecution in the Weber mur
der case at Auburn. District Attor
ney Robinson of Auburn will be as
sociated with the Attorney General. It
ia said that young Weber has arranged
to employ several of the best criminal
lawyers of the State in his behalf and
the battle before the Placer County
Superior Court will be a hard one.
General Webb says there will be no
friction between himself and Robin
son.

Judge B. G. Hurlburt of Campbell
addressed the convention In regard to
some needed reforms In taxation. Ad
journment was then taken till this aft

The report of the committee on res
olutions by Chairman Johu Markley
was the first business before the aft
ernoon session.
A resolution asking the Senators and
Representatives In Congress from the
Pacific Coast to respectfully Implore the
President and administration not to
press a repeal or alteration of the
present sweet wine law owing to the
enormous acreage devoted to that crop
and money invested because pt reli
ance on the present law was adopted.
Another resolution adopted urges the
Legislature to request that an ele
mentary branch In agriculture be added
as a prerequisite to graduation in the
several normal schc-ols. It stated that
study was of great value to all chil
dren and that it was imperative for
the best good of children that all teach
ers should be versed In the subject so
that they could teach It.

Sorosls Fruit Company, the ladies of
the San Jose Grange and the State
press were passed.
H. P. Stabler, chairman of the com
mittee on labor, reported for the com
mittee. He' believed that the solving
of the labor question in the orchards
lay in cutting up the large tracts of
land and selling it to families, thus set
tling the country and providing plenty
of help. The fruit season was too short
to import workers, he said. Stabler
also read a paper on "Increasing the
demand forlCalifornla cured fruit prod
ucts by advertising."
E. M. Swasey of San Francisco de
livered an* -address on "Advertising
California's cured fruit products." A

of this city, B. F. Walton of Yuba
City. John Markley of San Francisco,
B. E. Hutchlns of Fresno, and General
Jcnnlson of ' Covena was appointed to
look after all matters on which legis

then adjourned.
ARTIST'S CHILD
FATALLY BURNED
Three-Year-Old Daughter of
Charles Bollo Peters Meets
With a Frightful Death
CLOTHING TAKES FIBE
Accident Occurs While Little
One Is Playing in Boom of
Her Father's Bungalow
Special Dispatch to The Call.
MONTEREY, Dec. 9.â The old town
of Monterey was shocked this morning
at the death by fire of beautiful little
Kathleen Peters, daughter of Charles
Rollo Peters, the painter.
From what can be learned the little
one, 'with her elder sister and her
twin brother, had been playing in the
living room of the bungalow,, in which
a grate fire was burning. During their
play the sister and brother left the
room, leaving little Kathleen alone.
Soon screams were heard and the lit
tle one enveloped â in sheets of flame
rushed into the garden; An employe
ran to her, tore her clothing from her
body and smothered the blaze. But
help came too late. The flames had
burnt their way into her tender little
body, and death mercifully released her
from her suffering.
At the death of Mrs. Peters, for whom
the unhappy babe was named, she left
a little daughter six years of age, and
tiny twins; and it was for these wee
babes for whom she yielded her young
life. ;i^
Immediately after the loss of his
beautiful wife the artist secured the
services of a trustworthy woman of
Monterey, and confided to her the care
of his motherless babes.
A â¢ sad feature of the affair is that
the bereaved father had all but con
cluded negotiations for the sale of the
hacienda, intending to leave California
for Broadstalr, near London, the home
of Whistler and other famous painters,
and there to settle with his interesting
little brood.

STRICTER LAWS
FOR RAILROADS
CALL BUREAU, HOTEL BARTON,
WASHINGTON, Dec. 9.â President
Roosevelt is standing squarely on his
message in reference to the fixing of
railway rates by the Interstate Com
merce Commission, and he desires that
action be taken by Congress at this
session. Many Senators and Repre
sentatives called on him to-day to
learn hla views, and he told them
very frankly that he thought some
thing should be done in the â¢ way r of
enlarging the powers of the Inter
state Commerce Commission to reme
dy this evil, and that it should be done
immediately. ,
The Senators, who have determined
that, nothing shall be done until the
beginning of .â¢ the next Congress, have
accepted the situation, - and a contest
between the White House and the Sen
ate on the great question of railway
rates and Increased powers for the
Interstate Commerce Commission is
now fairly on.
In addition to making It known that
he Is In earnest for some action at the
present session of Congress, the Pres
ident has taken care to tell his callers
that his recommendation was not
made at the Instance of Governors
Cummins of Iowa, La Follette of Wis
consin and Van Sant of Minnesota.
When Governor Cummins and Gover
nor Van Sant called at the White
House two weeks ago the railway part
of the President's message was al
ready In type. Not a word was
changed as a result of that conference.
"The President Is undoubtedly In
favor of doing 'something' at this
session," said a Republican member of
the Senate Commission on Interstate
Commerce to-day, "but whether that
'something' means the full limit of
which he spoke in his message, I am
In some doubt. At least, it does not
look highly probable now."
It Is believed at the Capitol that the-
Senate leaders stand as a stone wall
against any action along the line of
the message. The determination In the
Senate Is to prevent It if possible, but
if the full power of the administration
is used the alternative is to bring for
ward a compromise proposition.

Special Dispatch to The Call!
VALLEJO, Dec. 9.â A force of men
under Master Electrician George
Hanscom left Mare Island to-day for
the Farallon Islands, â  where a '-ire
less telegraph plant will be established.
The work will be. performed by the
yar4 workmen. 7. ; .
It is expected that wireless connec
tion between the Farallones,' Yerba
Buena and Mare Island will be estab
lished within a few days. The men
have taken /with them a complete
camping outfit and provisions and will
remain at the Farallones until the
work is completed. As soon as con
nection is made the battleship Ohio
will test the apparatus.
This is believed to be the Govern
ment's first mqve toward the exten
sion of the wireless system to Hono
lulu. In the event that the present
plans are carried out the Farallones
station will be made the .head coast
station. This is evidenced by the fact
that plans for permanent buildings and
necessary adjuncts are already under
way.
EXTENDING THE SYSTEM.

SEATTLE, Dec. 9. â Within the next

graph station has been erected on top
of Queen Anne Hill in this city and in
a short time messages will be received
for transmission.
Apparatus has also been installed on
the revenue cutter Grant, so that com
munication may be had with the shore
stations when the cutter is In these

'But of course, Judge." said Mrs.
Pollard. "Arthur muet keep his word

Arthur did not seem to be exalted by
the reminder, for he moodily muttered
something about the lady having
threatened to go with another fellow if
the sura mentioned were not paid her.
"Tnt, tut. nonsense," exclaimed the
friend of the family. "She might have
said fhat when the was mad, but -I'm
sure Â»he would never do such a thing.
Would you, Mrs. Pollard?" v
*"Xo. indeed. I would not." was the
instant answer, accompanied by a lan
guishing glance at Mr. Pollard. "How
could I do auch a thing." inquired the
lady, locking at the Judge, "when Ar

"There now â there nowâ I - told you

bis tatlsfaction. "Now, Judge, they'll

gloomed, and the command to osculate
was mutually ignored, to the great dis
appointment of the auditory.

He declined polnt-blank^a request to
furnlrh an inquisitive bailiff with his
name, and as he had not beentfortnally
eubpenaed his cognomen was not on
record. All that could be . ascertained
anent his identity was Mrs. Pollard's
Inadvertent remark that he had been
her husband's employer for eighteen
consecutive years and that his tonsorial
parlor is en Second street, near Minna.
Until thÂ« cranial injury that neces
sitates Henry Sleaman's confinement
to hospital Is sufficiently healed safely
to permit his appearance to testify
Judge Mogan cannot definitely ascer
tain tbÂ« character of the missile with
â¢which the damage -was Inflicted. It- is
understood that Mr. Eleam'an claims
his head was struck by a dinner plate
hurled by bin stepson, Henry Raen
feld, but both Mr. Raenfeld and. his
wife deny that any such weapon was
used. Indeed, they aver that the in
dention of Mr. Sleaman's skull was
not made by anything cart by any
one, but was Inflicted in some way
which to them is a mystery, although
they would not be uurorised to learn
that it waÂ« resultant of a fall against
some sharp projection.
Mr. Sleaman alleges that he re
ceived his wound while he was dining
with Mr. and Mrs. Raenfeld- in their
home at Hunters Point. He had been in
vited there by his stepson, with whom
he had not been on speaking terms
for some time, and he accepted the
invitation because he regarded it as
an overture of peace. While sitting
at table he complimented Mrs. Raen
feld on her ability as: a cook and took
occasion to pay flattering tribute to
the crisp quality â  of some 'biscuits
â¢which she had ' baked.- To his i sur
prise she questioned his sincerity and
rudely requested him to cease "josh
ing" her, aa she did not propose to sit
there and be insulted in her' own
house, even if he had married her
husband's mother. Then, to his
deeper astonishment Mr. Raenfeld
took side with his wife and told him
(Mr. S.) that he ought to be ashamed
of himself and that if he did not IikÂ«
the biscuits he was privileged to shun
them. Mr. Sleaman's retort provoked
the throwing of the . thingâ either a
plate or a biscuit, most probably the
former â that cut a gash in his crani
um. It is expected that Mr. Sleaman
n ill be able to attend court next Mon
day.

Patrolman Ruggles averred - that
George Miller and Patrick Carron were
excited and en dishabille when he met
them at 3 o'clock yesterday morning
on Mission street, between Third and
Fourth, and that in answer to his query
as to what such extraordinary airing
of their nether limbs meant they in-
formed him that they were forced to
flee from their lodging place, the Mon
tana House, 784 on the flrst-named
thoroughfare, by the.brutal tyranny of
Night Clerk Fred Miles. Whereupon the
officer took the shivering duo back to
the Montana House, and his investiga
tion thatre warranted him in placing
Mr. Miles under arrest and recording
against him; two charges of battery. â - -.
By the testimony adduced before
Judge Mogan it was made apparent
that Mr. Miles was mispf&ced when he
assumed the night clerkship 'of the
Montana House, as his natural pen
chant for bullying fitted him better for
elave-drivlng. It was his wont, some
of the witnesses averred, maliciously to
conceive and execute devices for tor
turing the hapless transients who paid
10 cents for the privilege of occupying
the bunks all night under his supervi
sion. He awoke them when there was
no necessity for doing so, and if they
protested against his conduct he dis
ciplined them with fists heavily backed
by muscle and scientifically applied.
He treated them aa If they were pariah
dogs Instead of contributors ' to the
house, which in turn maintained him.
Mr. Miles' expulsion of Messrs. Car

to an Inquiry a high official of the State
Department said to-day that it was
true that .President Roosevelt expected
all members of the Cabinet and all
American Embassadors and Ministers
to foreign countries to submit their

This is a custom Jong followed at the

been some" hesltancr on the part of
officeholders in the classes mentioned.
This does not necessarily mean that
President Roosevelt will make a clean
sweep in the diplomatic service. Many
Embassadors and Ministers will be re

In new ones, but undoubtedly there will
be Important changes. It has been
stated, without denial from the White

anxious to retire, however. Powell

EDNA HOPPER
FULL OF FIGHT
Will Sue to Have Probate
Proceedings on the Dnns
niuir Estate Set Aside
FATAL DEFECTS IN CASE
Legal Battle for Millions
May Soon Be Transferred
From Victoria to This City
Documentary evidence showing that
the former Premier of British Colum
bia, James Dunsmuir, during his term
of office, swore to support the Consti
tulon of the United States will form
an interesting feature of a suit to be
filed in this city In a few days. At
torney j. c. Campbell of Campbell &
Metson is preparing an action which
aims to set aside all the probate pro
ceedings in the rich estate of the late
Alexander Dunsmuir, for which Edna
Wallace Hopper, the well-known
3'oung actress, backed by the mother
of Dunsmuir. Is now fighting in the
courts of Victoria. In this suit evi
dence will be introduced to ; show that
ex-Premier James Dunsmuir, in secur
ing letters of administration from the
local Superior Court, ascribed his sig
nature to a formal oath to supportthe
Constitutions of the United States and
the State of California, this proceed
ing being necessary in view of the fact
that Dunsmuir was a foreigner, i
The suit to be brought by Attorney
Campbell has been personally author
ized by Mrs. Dunsmuir and Mrs. Hop
per and will set forth several import
ant points, the gaining of which would
result in setting aside the probate pro
ceedings and possibly transfer to this
city the fight now being waged in the
Victoria courts. During the recent
hearing in Victoria the witnesses to
the will of Alexander Dunsmuir testi
fied that when they affixed their signa
tures to the will they did not know the
nature of the document. They were
positive on this point and the. con
testants immediately took advantage
of it, claiming that the California
statutes, which had Jurisdiction in the
matter, plainly provide that witnesses
to a will must be acquainted with the
nature of the document, and that it is
incumbent on the testator to Inform
them of the fact that the document is
his last will.
The court ignoring this contention
the contestants appealed and tne
higher court sustained the latter, go
ins so far as to rule that the point
was a vital one and agreeing to give
it full consideration as soon as a com
missioner could take further evidence
in the matter and make his report. It
is for the purpose of taking this testi
mony that Judge Coyne of New York,
who represents Miss Hopper, is now in
this city awaiting the arrival of the
le^al advisers of James Dunsmuir
from Victoria. Apparently the only
way out of the difficulty confronting
James Dunsmuir is for his witnesses
to freshen their minds and change
their testimony when it is taken next
week before the local British Consul.
It will also be shown that the late
Mrs. Wallace did not have her day in
court and was wrongfully advised as
to the California law by her attorneys,
Wilson & Wilson, who have been
charged with having worked on both
sides of the will case. Other allega
tions to be Incorporated In the com
plaint are that James Dunsmuir, in
petitioning for letters of administra
tion on the estate of his millionaire
brother, set forth that the latter had
been a resident of San Francisco, a
fact which Alexander Dunsmuir
claimed in two wills, one executed in
1898 and the other, his last, signed on
December 21, 1899. Evidence will be
Introduced to show that later James
Dunsmuir. when called upon to pay a
collateral tax at the time the estate
was ordered distributed, made affidavit
to the effect that his deceased brother
had not been a resident of California.

Disappears From Ilonie.
James R. McMahon, 39 years old,
and living with his wife at 351 Jesslu
street, was reported yesterday to the
police as missing. McMahon, who is
a carpet-layer, left his home last Sat
urday evening to draw his week's
wages. He attended a dance that
evening with a 1 friend, and since has
not been seen. His wife Is unable to
account for his disappearance, but the
police think he may have gone to Chi
cago, where an old friend lives, or that
he is on a prolonged spree. On Feb
ruary 23 McMahon distinguished him
self by assisting in the capture of two
burglars who were robbing the lodg
ing-house of 1,1 rs. Lola Joakin at 341
Jessie street. When, he discovered. the
presence of the thieves he got a shot
gun and in the fight that followed shot
one of the crooks, Joseph M. Wallace,
in the arm.

down beside her and look jealous.
The occasion was the presentation
of "The Land of the Nursery Rhymes"
under the auspices of the California
Club. .The -management of the play
was left to Miss Leta A. Saunders,
who certainly deserves the greatest

DOXOHOE BANKl ATTACHES
A MANUFACTURING FIRM
A writ of attachment was served
yesterday by the Sheriff's deputies on
firm of J. G. Grannis & Co., which
is engaged in the manufacture of
steam and hot water appliances at
565-669 Mission street. The attach
ment was sued out by the Donohoe-
Kelly Banking Company to secure the
payment of three notes aggregating
$12,000.
V. E. Grannis, secretary of the firm,
said last evening that the attachment
in no way affected the solvency of the
firm and was the result of a series of
incidents that.could not be controlled.
Ho said the three notes upon which
the attachment was sued out repre
sented the sum borrowed by his firm
to enable it to complete some large
contracts, payment on which would
immediately relieve the firm of its
temporary financial straits. Payment
for these contracts, he said, had been
held, up on account of the delay of
the architects in passing on the work,
but the payments would soon be made
and the notes taken up.
In conclusion he said there would
be no assignment and that the firm
would continue on its regular course.
Missions Close With Mnss.
The closing of the missions that
have been taking place at St. Mary's
Cathedral during the last three weeks
was solemnized yesterday morning at
9 o'clock by a- requiem mass. The
mass was said for all the deceased
members of that parish. Father Lan
dry was the celebrant. Father Nu
gent, the deacon, and Father Morris
the sub-deacon. The service was of
the most impressive character.

OF COOL CRIME
David Kinify Glories in His
Career as Who
Has' Mate a Success in Life
BIUG^OF HIS PROWESS
Meahwhile Evidence Accum
ulates to Fasten on Him
Murder of Patrolman Smith
Oakland Office San Francisco. Call.
1016 Broadway, Dec. 9.
David Kiniry was revealed af the
preliminary examination to-day as a
cold-blooded and cunning burglar,
proud of his criminal record.
Many conversations with Kiniry, by
Chief Hodgkins and Captain W. J. Pe
tersen. shed light on "the character of
the suspected murderer of brave Po
liceman Smith: Many cf the Chief's
conversations took place at Los Ange
les. Kiniry bragged that from the
Crellin and Bannan residences in Oak
land he stole $10,000 worth of plunder.
He told how cleverly he had climbed to
get into these residences. He was volu
ble about the meeting with Policeman
Smith and admitted that Goldstein and
he were c-ut on a burglarious expedi
tion, but when Hodgkins and Peter
sen later asked: "Who fired the first
shot?" Kiniry balked.
"You don't expect me to tell all my
case, do you?" he said.
But they got him to tell how he fled
after the shooting and landed that
night in a Turk street lodging
house in San Francisco that had for
merly been kept by Mrs. Greiner, moth
er of Frank Goldstein.
After the shooting Kiniry visited with
Fred Rouchon, an uncle, and then de
parted on a bicycle for San Jose, con
tinuing his flight to Los Angeles, thence
Ejist. - He went to the St. Louis Ex
poMtic-n, heading West after he had
lost many diamonds and a wallet with
$365.
"I came back to rob a pawnshop at
Los Ajjgeles, where I expected to get
$120,000," said Kiniry, explaining his
return to California.
Kiniry said Goldstein owed him $200,
and he thought it might be a good way
to settle accounts by listening to the
youth's pleas to be taken into partner
ship. He says Goldstein was always
afraid, though he always stood guard
while Kiniry did the robbing.
Hodgkins rehearsed mucn in detail
in talks with Kiniry touching the
shooting.
Ross Steadman, son of Mrs. W. E.
Steadman, at whose residence, 1362
Grove street, Kiniry and Goldstein
roomed at the time of the murder, tes
tified this morning that he had seen
the pair leave the house together the
evening of the shooting. Steadman
heard of the murder, went to Four
teenth and Oak streets, where he saw
Goldstein's body and thought he rec
ognized, the sweater. Returning home
Steadman.- found a note written, by
Kiniry that read:
Will be home In the course of a week. Tbo
Boys. If we send any notice please follow In
structions.
Mrs. Steadman followed her son and
made a remarkable demonstration of
sympathy for Kiniry.
As she left the witness-stand, Kiniry
said to her:
"I am sorry for all of the inconveni
ence I put you to."
"I am very sorry it happened," re
plied Mrs. Steadman. "I can't eay
anything against you "
"Stop! that will do, madam," stern
ly ordered Judge Samuels.
Captain of Police W. J. Petersen tes
tified to the finding of a loaded revol
ver near Goldstein's body. The
weapon showed no evidence of having
been recently discharged.
Poiicemen Flynn, Moore and Bran
nan furnished connecting Items of evi
dence. H. R. Buswell. assistant secre
tary of the Young Men's Christian As
sociation, identified an application for
membership card Kiniry had deposited
with him.
"Any chance of my getting back my
application fee of $10?" asked Kiniry.
"There may be," replied Buswell.
"I wish you would look up that mat
ter," 'urged Kiniry.
Maury Miller, a boy, neighbor of the
Steadmans, 8aw Kiniry and Goldstein
departing from the Steadman place the
night .Smith was murdered. Detective
George Kyte identified a pistol, box of
cartridges, black silk muffler in
itialed "E. J. B.," loose cartridges
writing paper and William Bannan's
cuff-buttons as having â¢ been found
among the pair's effects at the Stead
man house. The hearing will be con
cluded to-morrow.
CHARGE EMERGENCY HOSPITAL
DOCTORS WITH CARELESSNESS
In Cases of James Welch and Wil
liam Feely Records Show Cor
rect Diagnosis. > 7. " . 'â 
Although the records of the Central
Emergency Hospital show that John
Welch was treated* there on December
5 for a fracture of the femur and sub
sequently died from the effects of the
shock to his system, a Coroner's jury
yesterday returned a verdict in the
case censuring the Emergency Hos
pital surgeons for "failing to give the
patient a thorough examination "
The verdict added, "But we regard
death as purely accidental." a
Welch was 70 years of age He
fell down a light well on the date
mentioned and was sent to the hos
pital for treatment.
William Feely died at the City and
County Hospital Wednesday from the
effect .of seven broken ribs and inter
nal injuries. His relatives claim that
his case was incorrectly diagnosed by
the â¢ Emergency Hospital surgeons
The records, however, show that Dr
Hill correctly diagnosed his case and
treated him accordingly. Feely had
been drinking and it was also neces
sary to treat him for alcoholism.
DECLARES HE WAS ROBBED
BY TWO CAUD SWINDLERS
. Warrants were sworn out yesterday
for the arrest of Harry Walters and
Joe Furey on a charge of robbing J.
C. Tarrant of 24 Tiffany avenue of
$451 in a card game. The date of the
alleged criminal transaction is given
as September 13, 1903. Tarrant's ex
cv.se ,for not makins the complaint
sooner is that he ha'd been absent in
thr; East since that time.
When the warrants were placed in
the hands of the Detective Depart
ment it was ascertained that Furey
had been shot and killed in Boston a
short time ago. A quarrel in a poker
gume caused his death. Walters can
net be found and Detective Bailey has

OAKLAID'S LEADING
ADVERTISING MAN
A Strong Believer in the
Daily Newspaper.
What Stuart W. Booth Has
Done to Educate Oakland
in Advertising.
Any one familiar with the newspaper
field in Oakland can not have failed to
be Impressed with the remarkable In
crease of advertising of the leading busi
ness- houses, as well as the excellent
quality of the advertisements themselves.
This growth has not been of the mush
room variety, but largely the result of
patient and persistent effort on the oart
of one man, Mr. Stuart W. Booth,
llr. Booth Is one of the most conserva
tive optimists of Oakland to-day. For
several years he has devoted his energies
and intelli~ence toward, raising the stand
ard of advertising in that locality. It is
refreshing to talk with Mr. Booth: ha
never knows anything but what ia forth*
welfare and upbuilding of h}s community
and its people. Publicity In all deslrahlÂ»
forms is his creed, no matter whether it
be the exploiting of a retail firm, tha
preparation of political matter, the com
piling of articles setting forth all that is
good in Oakland â it makes no difference
what it is. the best and brightest side,
which is always th* safest, appeals only
to him, and through him to the tens of
thousands of others who dally, though,
without knowing it. are influenced by hi3
work in the local newspapers.
3IR. BOOTH'S ABILITY.
The ability of Mr. Booth In this direc
tion was first detected by that shrewd
and successful man. Mr. John A.
Britton. and for several years the pub
licity department of the Oakland Gas.
Light and Heat Company has been man
aged by Stuart W. Booth. All the Intel
ligent and productive work. whether
newspaper advertising or through store
magazines, which bears the Imprint ofl
the If. C. Capwell Company, has been thÂ«
Individual work of Stuart W. Booth.
Mr. Booth's ability since that time tÂ»
handle advertising successfully In all its
aspects â compiling, writing, displaying,
illustrating â has been recognized by
every merchant in Oakland. So great is
the confidence placed in his Judgment
and in his integrity that many mer
chants outside of his list do not hesitate
for a moment to consnlt him on matters
of business, knowing full well that what
ever Mr. Booth says in regard to pub
licity will be reliable and practical.
LEGITIMATE ADVERTISING.
The legitimate newspaper is the proper
thing to advertise In. Mr. Booth believes,
and the success which he has met with
in this regard justifies his belief.
His experience has been very wide, and
he is as familiar with London, Calcutta
and Pitcairn Island as he is with San
Francisco Bay. For a dozen years of his
life he was an officer In the British mer
chant marine, and ht3 extensive travels
have proved of . inestimable value in his
career of publicity. For a long time ha
was engaged in newspaper work, but has
abandoned that in order to give his en
tiro time to the business of his publicity
bureau, located in a suite of Tooms at
No. 957 Broadway.
DESERVEDLY POPULAR.
Two important positions are held by
Mr. Booth. He isa director of the Oak
land Board of Trade and is chairman of
the publicity committee of that organic
zation. His popularity in his. home dis
trict. East Oakland, is attested by tho
fact that he is now. for the second term,
president of that flourishing civic reli
gious organization, the Men's Sunday
Club of Kast Oakland.
ORIGINAL PLANS WILL STAND.
Loss o f Ships nt Port Arthur Will Not
Disarrange Admiralty's Scheme.
ST. PETERSBURG, Dec. 9.â The Ad
miralty announces officially that\ while
the only ships still in the Baltic will bÂ«
made ready as soon as possible against
any eventuallity, no decision has yet
been arrived at regarding sending tham
to the Far East. The battleship Sylva,
the only modern battleship, will not be
completed befo-re early in the spring.
The statement is made that even if.
every ship of the Port Arthur squadron
is destroyed, it will have no effect on
Rojestvensky's plans, which never con
templated assistance from the Port Ar
thur squadron. The reports of the pink
ing of a number of Russian ships, of
whith the Admiralty has no confirma
tion, however, caused a feeling of ex
treme sadness in high naval circles,
where the plans of Rear Admiral Wir
en. the commander of the Port Arthur
squadron, were known/ It seems In
credible that when it became apparent
the ships were unde^flre of the Jap
anese guns that theP were not taken
out and sunk In deep water, where they
would be beyond the pc-asibility of
salvage. The only way in which the
officials here can account for the fail
ure to do so is that Admiral Wiren
was confronted by conditions of which
the Admiralty is in isrnorancc.

TO FIGHT TRUST
Wine Growers of Lodi and
Vicinity Are Organizing an
Independent Association
Special Dispatch to The Call.
STOCKTON. Dec. 9.â A large co-op
erative association of winegrowers,
backed by big capital, whose purpose
is to fight the "wine trust," is being
organized by the vlticulturists of Lodi

known winegrowers of that district re
cently held a meeting in Woodbridge
and decided to form a co-operative as
sociation and pool issues. A large
winery will be erected in the town of
Woodbridge. Already the site has been
secured. The following in all probabil
ity will be the trustees of the associa
tion for the first year: John C. Thomp
son, 1 C. Li Newton, Frank Parrott, F.
B. Mills, J. Brock Jr.. Alexie Chapde
lain and Amos Boyce.
-Growers representing 1050 acres of
wine grapes have already agreed to en
ter ' the association. Each subscribes
for one share of stock for each acre of
wine grapes he owns. The stockholders
bind themselves to sell all their grapes
to the association's winery for the next
seven years. The acreage represented
all lies, in- the vicinity of Woodbridge
and Acampo. j
The new company In all probability
will become a big factor in the wine
growing industry in San Joaquin Coun
ty. It will have a capital stock of $200.
000. All the stockholders are men of
means.

SATURDAY \ DECEMBER 10, 1904
A MINING MEMORIAL.
THE determination of the California Miners' Association to me
morialize President Roosevelt upon the much vexed question of
hydraulic mining and the misdeeds of which it has been accused
is one to which no exception can possibly be taken. The miners un
questionably feel that they have a. real and a legitimate grievance.
There is no reason whatever to doubt that an enormous amount of
gold exists in the river channels of California and that this wealth
cannot be profitably Avorked by any other than the hydraulic process.
They have, however, been restrained from this method of ex
traction upon the double ground of consequent injury to agricul
tural land and also to the navigable waters of the State. It is of
course of the highest importance that neither agriculture nor naviga
tion should be menaced, and if hydraulic mining is shown to be tn
compatible with the safety of these vital interests the miners them
selves could hardly protest against the injunctions laid upon them.
That is, however, the precise point which has been raised. The
mining convention admits that unrestrained debris is injurious and
this of course admits of no dispute. They contend, however, that
the hydraulic process has been made responsible, not only for its
own sins, but also Tor natural erosion and sedimentation, and that
these factors would still persist to the detriment of agriculture and
navigation whatever be the fate of hydraulic mining. The problem
is a scientific one. and inasmuch as it can be solved only by trained
geologists the miners' convention has petitioned the President to
invite the attention of the director of the Geological Survey to a
special consideration of those portions of the valleys which are in
juriously affected by detritus. It will then be possible to rightly
apportion the responsibility between the hydraulic mining upon the
one hand and the natural progress of erosion and sedimentation upon
the other.
In addition to" this determination of the actual causes of the
injuries complained of by the farmers the President is also asked
to secure expert opinion as to a suitable disposition of the detritus
from torrential streams with a view to its utilization for the redemp
tion of waste lands. The memorialists believe that mining debris
could thus be made to serve a useful purpose, and that so .far from
being detrimental to agriculture it could be made to subserve, not
only the farming interests, but also those of forestry. -By the same
means the water courses would be kept clear for purposes of navi
gation. This would of course be the ideal solution, and one which
we heartily hope will eventually be found.
If the President should accede to these requests and if, as a
result, it should be possible to relax the injunctions against hydraulic
mining, there will certainly be a very general gratification. Gold
mining is the senior and the pioneer industry of the State, and its
restrictive regulation was only undertaken under the most urgent
necessity and for the absolute preservation of agriculture and of
navigation. The capital involved, and now standing idle, is a very
large one, amounting to no less than $100,000,000, and if a modus
vivendi can be found which will allow the mines to resume profitable
work without prejudice to other industries it will be to the advantage
of the State and of the country. In thus appealing to the President
to adjust the differences between great interests, and to do it with
as little loss of time as possible, the convention has probably takÂ«n
the most judicious step toward the final solution of an important
SUNDAY CALL MAGAZINE.
a FTER a long period of obscurity "Chimmie Fadden" has at
ZA last been brought to the light again, and once more Edward
r V.r- W. Townsend's typical offshoot of the Bowery will deliver
himself of his inimitable witticisms and recite, in his own droll way,
some of the many thrilling episodes in which he figures. In the
Sunday Call to-morrow will appear the first installment in a new
"Chimmie Fadden" series. By way of introducing himself again to
his many friends Chimmie, in company with a Japanese "p a^Â»" whom
he has taught to box, go together to a meeting of Russian anarchists.
It takes but a very short time for the inbred antipathy of the Jap
for the Russians, coupled with the ingenuousness of Chimmie, to
start a truly inspiring "rough house." The series will be continued
for several months.
"Double Harness,*' Anthony Hope's latest novel, which began in
the Sunday Call on November 20, runs through its fourth installment.
This novel, which is longer than usual, will be completed shortly, and
then there will begin "The Brethren," by H. Rider Haggard. This is
the very latest work of the famous romanticist, and represents him
at the very maturity of his virile, romantic imagination. The scene is
laid during the Crusades. In this story Mr. Haggard has relin
quished the reins of sensationalism and devoted his talents to legiti
mate romance, in which he has stamped himself as a master. The
hosts of admirers of the author of "She," "King Solomon's Mines"
and a score of other novels equally popular will welcome the ad
vent of a new book by this world famous author.
"Kentuck Randall's Estate" -is the title of a clever story of early
California mining camp life, written by Frank Corwin Radcliffe, which
wins the S50 cash prize for the fourth week of the fiction contest.
Other features of interest embrace a page by Opie Read "On Law
yers." the regular installment of the Lim Jucklin series ; "On and Off
the Bread Wagon" by Charles Dryden ; a page on the books of the
season by Robert W. Ritchie, literary critic; a page by Madge
Moore, "Are Bridal Veils on the -Wane?" and a full page picture
of the floor arrangement of the House of Representatives at Wash
ington, with the photograph of each member at his proper desk,
In addition there is, as usual, the puzzle page for the children.
A PRESENT FROM CALIFORNIA.
THE approach of Christmas and the consequent interchange of
presents gives to Californians an opportunity to enhance the
interests of their State, of which they should hasten to avail
themselves. There are very few families without relativesvor friends
in the East or elsewhere throughout the Union, and what gift could
be more acceptable than some article distinctively Californian in
production or manufacture?
Humap nature is carelessly prone to underrate the things with
which it is most familiar, and it is certain that we do not sufficiently
realize the interest which is almost universally evoked by objects
whieji are peculiarly representative of California, whether they relate
to her s fascinating history, to her products, or to the industry of her
people. To civilization at large California is the home of romance
as well as the garden of the 'world, and in selecting a Christmas of
fering which is essentially Californian we shall not only immensely
enhance the pleasure which the gift will cause, but also repay to
the State some of the debt for health, happiness and prosperity which
we indubitably owe to her.
Individual Californians have the power to promote the inter
ests of the State to a much greater extent than |hey us'ually sup
pose. Here is one of the ways in which that power can be exercised.

HANDSOME YOUNGSTER WHO IS IN
DEMAND AT ENGLISH WEDDINGS
THE IIOX. MAYXARD GREY'ILLE.
CITTLE Maynard Greville, the youngest son of the Earl and Count
ess of Warwick, says the London correspondent of The Call, has
probably taken part In more weddings than any other boy living.
He Is such a handsome youngster that for the last few years his
services as a page at fashionable London marriages have been in
almost constant demand, and it * wouldn't be surprising if he could
recite most of the service by heart. Maynard is now nearly seven and
getting almost too big for the position of page-in-ordlnary to society,
which will probably be filled when Maynard "retires" by little Lord
Ufllngton, the son of the American Countess of Craven.
EDUCATIONAL ADVANTAGES
There was a man who had two boys.
The older one was tall and slim,
Who studied hard dnd hated noise,
Just books and work delighted him.
The other was a husky lad
Who looked on study with disdain;
Greek prose and physics made him sad.
He ran much more to brawn than
brain.
Now these two youths to college went,
The elder labored like a horse;
His time was all to study lent,
' He gladly took each extra course,
For learning he became renowned,
The leader^ef his class was he.
And when 'commencement day rolled
'round ~
He spoke the valedictory.
A different course the younger took.
Horatian odes he did not deem
Worth while. He seldom conned a book â
Instead he made the football team.
In classroom work he did not shine, ?
His blunders made professors rage,
But his great deeds behind the line
Filled up the Sunday sporting page.
Now twenty years have passed away.
The learned man is teaching school;
He draws three dollars every day
And labors hard with many a fool.
While he whom rooters loved to cheer
Went through the line he used to bust,
Gets forty thousand every year
For managing a vicious trust.

Black Fridays.
The American Black Friday was Sep

LL "Little Italy" was in a fer-

(J tenement to 'tenement ran the
w^\ fire of loud comment, chatter-
I ing voices, accompanied by the
/ animated gesticulation which
is part and parcel of the Latin's
language. " Fathers could ' be seen
shaving, washing and even dress
ing s through open - doors or on the
doorsteps or the. fire escape - balconies,
those summer homes of the slums.
Mothers were busy with refractory
children to whom unwonted scrubbings
and clean clothes were a novelty not
altogether pleasant, but to be endured
because of the great event that was
to follow, and for which all this fuss
was preparatory.
It was a great day. At last, in this

.A girlish figure in a half-soiled wrap

WE ALL EAT
TOO MUCH.
As the result of his exhaustive ex
periments with a squad of United
States soldiers doing heavy gymnasium
work under restricted diet, Professor
Chittenden of Yale concludes that
most people eat too much, says the New
York World.
The men were worked hard In the
gymnasium and gained steadily and
gVeatly in strength >while they were
being fed far less than the average
diet.
They were called the Â« "starvation
squad," but their photographs /taken
at the close of the experiment do not
look like those of starving men, rather
like those of competent gymnasts.
Says, Professor Chittenden in his re
cently published "Physiological Econ
omy in Nutrition": "Our results * â¢ *
justify the conviction that the minimal
protled requirements of the healthy
man under ordinary conditions of life
are far below the generally accepted
dietary standards,' and far below the
amounts called for by the acquired
tastes of the generality of mankind.
The amount of proteid or albuminous
food needed daily for the actual phys
iological wants of the body is not
mere than one-half of the proteid
food^ordinarily consumed by the aver
age man. Cody weight' (when once
adjusted to the new level), health,
strength, mental and physical vigor
and endurance can be maintained with
at least one-htilf of the proteid food
ordinarily consumed."
Proteids are the chemical elements
that most people get by a meat diet,
though beans, peas and some other
vegetables are also strong in proteids.
Eat less meat is the practical equiva
lent of Professor Chittenden's advice.
It has often been noticed by ama
teur mountaineers that Adirondack
guides and Swiss mountain men eat
less solid food than the average Wall
street broker, who does little physical
labor. , . . " ,

brushed close against the gorgeous
silk mantle that robed the statue, after
the custom of the Latin countries. It
was done in an instant, and when she
pushed onward In the crowd she held
her recovered treasure tight in her
hand. She had profaned the Holy

In the" thrill of terror at the thought
she would have gone back to restore
the trinket, but she could not stem the
tide of humanity pouring down the
aisles, and Just then a glimpse of To

toward any repentance.
Slipping from her mother's tide she
elbowed her way unnoticed across to
a corner they must pass on the way
out, and waited. As they went by, too
absorbed to see her, she slipped out,
pressed, close behind the pair and with

THEIR POLICY
Davis Defines Legal StanfliDg of Polar Star
Case and Caminetti Talks of Dams.
NEW ERA PREDICTED FOR HYDRALLICKING
Several matters of large importance
to the miners of California that -were
discussed in the convention of the Cal
ifornia Miners' Association during the
present week will receive the earnest
attention of the entire State In the
near future-
Hydraulic mining was given the
first place in discussion and the inter
est that was manifested in having that
branch of mineral activity once more
operative was manifested by the me
morial that, at the suggestion of Pro
lessor Christy of the University of
California, was sent to President
lioosevelt.
A resolution referring to dams, in
addition to the restraining works on
the Yuba River, was adopted by the
Â« onvention. In the routine reports of
the proceedings of the annual conven
tion of the miners there was not room
for detailed accounts of the recom
mendations of the important commit
u-es of the Miners' Association.
The committee on dams, in addition
to the recommendations that it made
through A. Caminetti, its chairman,
reviewed the Yuba situation and in de
tail reported what is considered by
the miners to be needed in certain di
rections.
To complete the record and to give
the people of the State a comprehen
sive and accurate idea of the facts
seme extracts are given this morning
from the reports of the committee on
dams and the committee on legisla
tion. The report of the legislation
committee was made by John F.
Davis, who has headed this commit
tee for a term of years.
Mr. Caminetti reviewed, as a pre
liminary, the statements about the
\\ crks on the Yuba River that ap
peared over the signature of Captain
Harts of the United States Corps of
Kngineers in the Scientific American.
Then Mr. Caminetti reported in part
as follows:
We havÂ« taken the privilege of quoting llb
*raMy :rorn this article because it emanates
I : om an orflcisil source and was written by an
â¢ o:nc*' of distinguished attainments who has,
curing his service, given the subject matter
thorough investigation.
It Is contorting to know from such authority
now that one of the important stages of the
Vcrk cf construction of said project is com
mitted, that the view often expressed, even by
tome hydraulic miners, that such miners have
nothing to hope for In the completion of the
projt?ct. Is without foundation.
The plain statements that the plan contem-
I".ates â¢'the storage of the enormous quantity
i : .-â¢:._; already In the river bed." as well
as "preventing the further addition to this
amount by holding back such as may in the
future be carried down": that 'â¢practically all
the coarser material brought Into the Yuba
Kiver will be h*ld by the upper barriers";
that "all the finer material during most of the
j .-ar will be carried Into settling basins, where
it will be Impounded," and that "there will be
arapl* room for many years for the storage
of mining detritus." certainly refer to debris
vthfr than that now lodged in the river bed.
This conclusion is inevitable when we take
ir.to consideration the lmmenÂ»* storage area
covered by the project, not only for coarse
material, but also for the finer aÂ» well. This
is strengthened by the suggestion that more
l>arri-rs above those now proposed can be con
structed and more room for settling pools to
deposit the fine material exists, thus affording
greater storage area, ehould it be required.
SEEKING MORE DAMS.
Our cnercies should now b* directed toward
â¢c^urlr.g necessary appropriation* from the
and National governments for the pur
lÂ»>se of constructing the dams contemplated
by the Jaw in the tributaries of the Tuba above
I >.itru< rre Point End the dams and restraining
barriers in the Bear, American, Consumnes,
Mokelumne. Calaveras and Stanislaus river
eys-tenis togctbtr with those en such streams
as Webber Creek in El Dorado County and
Batter Creek in Amador County, all of which
have received the same attention from the en
rin^r oificers and the law as tlxat given to
th* Yuba system above Jlarysvllle.
The art of lSi>3 has specially adopted the
plans set forth in the "Mendell Report" of
jv>^. and in the "Biggs Commission Report,'
tor all these rivers and th-elr respective tribu
taries and n-.sde the sam* the barts of opera
tion in the future administration of the powers
confcrrÂ»-d thereby.
Cattfomla can profitably appropriate a rea-
F'.r.able sura of money with the object of build
):;g some of these dams, Independent of any
ac-tion by the United States, Just as It is doing
now fcr river improvement purposes, notwlth

THE POLAR .STAR CASE.
In view of the desire of the miners
to have the Polar Star mine case
brought to final determination In
court, an extract from Davis* report
for Â£he committee on legislation is In
teresting. It is as follows:
Arrangements were made by the executive
committee with the firm of Solinsky & Wehe,
Â«ttorneys-at-law. under which they agreed to
take the case to the Supreme Court without
compensation. There seems to have been some
misapprehension with reference to the question
whether a proper record could be not be
fore the Supreme Court, inasmuch as the time
for the appeal from -the Judgment had passed.
Mr. Devlin, attorney for the Anti-Debris As
sociation, however, when questioned as late
as the day of the beginning or t:ilp convention,
6till stated that he would ralsj no such ques
tion, and would willingly admit service of
notice for a motion for a new trial. ' This
will completely clear any record tangle on the
question of time.
It has been decided by the Supreme Court
of this State la the case of Simpson vs. Burtd,
01 Cal. 88, that "though the right to make a
motion for a new trial is statutory and does
not exist if the proper steps are not taken
within the time allowed by the statute, as
against a party who stands upon the statute
and Insists upon a strict compliance therewith,
yet the time for every step to be taken in re
lation thereto may be waived or extended by
constant cf the parties."
ITpon the assurance of Mr. Devlin that he
will admit service of the notice of motion for
a nÂ«'w trial under oral Etloulaticn that the
time has always been extendecior the same,
the point that this association desires deter
mined can now be presented, clear cut, to the
Supreme Court by Messrs. Solinsky & Wehe,
who report to us that they are going ahead
on these linos.
The important proposition of the
segregation of the mineral lands in
cluded in the railroad land grants in
California was treated in a preamble
and resolution of the committee on
resolutions, both of which were
adopted by the convention. The text
in full is as follows:
Whereas, There Is an absolute, urgent and
immediate necessity for the segregation of the
mineral lane's within the railroad land grants
of the State cf California In order that such
mineral lands may be restored to the public
domain, and thus be made available to the
mining prospector, and
Whereas, These mineral lands were espec
ially cxcppted from the railroad land grants
and have never been granted by the United
States Government to any railroad company,
and were Intended to be specifically preserved
as a cart of the public domain, open to ex
ploration and purchase under the Federal
mining laws, and to that end a bill was Intro
duced In the lart eoeselon of the Congress of
the United States and is now pending in
said body; now. therefore, be It "
Resolved. That, in addition to procuring a
segregation of the mineral lands within the
railroad land grants, the California delegation
In Congress be requested to propose to use all
honorable means to obtain the necessary legis
lation to have a new segregation of the min
eral lands of the public domain in this State
turn segregation to be made under the direc
tion of the Director of the United States Oeo-
logical Survey, . and that ouch classification
shall be accepted as crima facie evidence of
the mineral character of such lands in all
cases appearing before the land department
and court* of the United States.

McDonnell Seeks Pardon.
George T. McDonnell, who is in the
penitentiary for using the postofflce to
further a scheme to defraud, has ap
plied to the Department of Justice for
a pardon and the department has re
ferred the matter to United States
District Attorney Woodworth for his
opinion. Inasmuch as McDonnell
served a twenty-year term of impris

being - connected with the notorious

the Bank of England and as the pres
ent offense was clearly proved against
him, Mr. Woodworth declines to rec

VIKING SHIP UNEARTHED
BY FARMER'S PLOW.
Hofds the- Bones of Norwegian Princess
HULK OF A VIKING SHIP EXHUMED IN NORWAY AFTER HAVING SERVED
FOR CENTURIES AS THE SARCOPHAGUS FOR THE REMAINS OF SOME
PRINCESS iOF ANCIEXT TIMES.
Svend Hansen, a young Norwegian
sailorman, who for a number of years
has been employed on coasting vessels
running Into this port, has Just re
turned from a visit to Norway, and
brings with him news of an interesting
discovery made by a farmer neighbor
of the old folks at home. He also
brings a photograph of the find.
While plowing a few months ago
this Norwegian farmer, whose land lies
about ten miles Inland from the port of
Tonsberg, wrecked his plow against
what he thought was a stump. Investi
gation showed that he had been in col
lision with a Viking ship, the stout
oaken prow of which lay within a foot
of the soil's surface.
The farmer .hitched. a team to the
supposed stump, but all the available
horse power failed to stir the obstruc
tion. The ground was dug away from
around the prow. The more the farm
er dug the more he found, and when
the work of excavation was finished
there in the middle of his field. In the
spade-made dock, lay the v strangest
looking craft twentieth century eyes
had ever gazed upon.
Scientists visited the relic and are
still trying to wrest its secret from this
hold-over remnant of a day long for
gotten. The bones of a woman were
found in an oaken chest which lay fore
and aft in the center of the ship. /
Before Hansen left his old home, a
month or so ago, one of the scientists
Alleges He Was Swindled.
Melancthon Phillips, 117 Ripley
street, obtained a warrant from Police
Judge Fritz yesterday for the arrest
of Joseph F. Donaldson, an attorney,
on a charge of gTanti larceny. He al
ieges that Donaldson represented to
him that he .M'as engaged in the real
estate business, promising if Phillips
gave him $500 to guarantee him an
income of $75 per month and also to
give him a deed to five lots in this city.
At the end of six months the $500 was
to be returned to Phillips. The money
was paid in September, but Phillips
says he has not received a cent from
Donaldson. He got a deed to the lots,
but Donaldson secured it again on the
p)ea that he would record it.

THE HIGHEST A*V&RÂ»
Worlds Fair Saint Louis
"JThis is even higher than the Gold: Medal;
told him the result of their investiga- |
tions as far as they had gone. (The ship, '
said the man of science, undoubtedly
belonged to the eighth century. It had
been brought from the sea, which in .
those days was not ten miles distant, j
by way of a gulch that is still visible. ;
The vessel had been dragged ashore, â¢
taken on rollers to an excavation and
there burled. The reason for all this 5 ,
the learned man thought, was to be
found in the box of bones. That box, i
he said, had been the coffln of a Prln- ;
cess, to whose memory the vikings had
paid the highest tribute In their power =
by giving up a warship, their most.val- !
ued possession, to be used as a sarco- j
phagus for the fair lady's mortal re
mains. ;, .;. ,..
Such of the : ship's., planking as was
found- is - in *â¢ good condition,' and the
oars, a score or vdoYef of which : were
buried beside the craft, are still tough
enough for use. A board was found on
which were inscribed characters which
the scientists are now try Ing! to trans
late. The. farmer on whose land the
ship was found was trying to sell his
find to the Norwegian Government
when Hansen left home. He wanted
30,000 crowns for it. The vessel is about
ninety feet long. No arms were fdund
near by, the soil having been excavated
for some distance on all sides. The,
boat, the oars, the bones and the for-!
gotten script on a decaying board are
all that the twentieth century has upon
which to reconstruct a lost chapter of ;
eighth century history or romance. j
Letcher Fights His Extradition.
The hearing on the application for
a writ of habeas corpus for the re
lease of George Letcher, the San Jose
capitalist, accused of being a fugitive
from justice, came up before Judge
Cook yesterday. The Governor's war
rant of extradition was submitted, but
it was claimed that Letcher was not a
fugitive from justice and that the pa
pers on which the warrant was grant
ed were insufficient. The case waa
continued till Monday morning. Mean
time Letcher was ordered released on
$6000 bonds, which was promptly
forthcoming. Letcher Is wanted in
Ohio for arson, alleged to have been
committed about twenty years ago.

RESERVOIR SITE
ON TWIN PEAKS
Supervisors Favor Purchase
of Land for an Auxiliary
Fire Protection System
WILL CONSIDER OFFER
Selection of Block of Prop
erty for New Public Li
brary to Be : Determined
The Supervisors' Joint Committee on
Fire, Utilities and Finance yesterday
considered the advisability of insti
tuting proceedings for the con
demnation of land ' on Twin
Peaks as a reservoir site for an
auxiliary high-pressure, 20,000,000-gal
lon water supply system for increased
fire protection. The Market and Stan
yan Streets Improvement Company,
through its president, Orville D. Bald
win, offered to sell forty-seven acres
for the purpose at $3000 per acre, or
$141,000, but the committee thought this
too high. The land is assessed for only
$22,000. .;Vy; .-.
/ City Engineer Woodward recom
mended the purchase of the entire
tract, a portion of which could be util
ized for a park, as already proposed.
After some discussion Baldwin agreed
to call a meeting of his board of di
rectors and submit another offer for
the sale of the forty-seven acres, the
committee having decided that the en
tire tract be bought by the city. It was
stated that the company, would not sell
at less than $2000 an acre. Although
$150,000 has been appropriated for the
system, the city may only expend $50,
000 each year for the purchase of lands.
The committee will meet next Friday
at 3 p. m. to consider the offer.
At the same time it will also take up
the proposed acquisition of a block of
land for the new public library, the
bond Issue for which was sold to a
bank syndicate. Two blocks are under
consideration, one bounded by Hayes,
Fell, Van Ness and Franklin, which Is
favored by the library trustees, and
the other by Fulton. Grove, Polk and
Van Ness avenue. The committee first
decided to invite bids for sites for the
library, but thought it better to defer
action, as it is not certain that either
of the sites-mentioned will be the civic
center of the new San Francisco, for
whose adornment Ideas are proposed.

The three matches to be played to

Football League are as follows: Vam
pires vs. Oakland Hornets, on the
cricket ground at Alameda; Independ
ents vs. Eagles, at Freeman's Park,
Golden Gate, and Pickwicks vs. Albion
Kovers, at Idora Park, Oakland.
As the Independents will dispose
easily of the Eagles and the Albion j
Hovers are too strong for the Pick
v. :cks, the most interesting contest will
be that between the Vampires and the
Oakland Hornets. The Hornets man
aged, for the tirst time during the
present season, to put a team fairly
representing their strength on the field
last Sunday and beat the Occidentals,
who had won all their three previous
matches. Some changes will be made
in the positions and make-up of the
team, and a keen game should result.

INGLESIDE PARK
GATES CLOSED
Coursing to Be Conducted
on but One Field for
an Indefinite Period
The struggle between the Greyhound
Owners' Association and tne managers
of the two parks in this district, which
has been in progress for some time,
has at last reached an acute stage. As
a result there will be no coursing at
Ingleside Park to-day and it is an
nounced the gates will -remain closed
for an Indefinite period. Union Park
will continue to run with greyhounds
owned by men not affiliated with the
association.
Affairs had reached a point where
the owners of greyhounds assumed
the right to dictate the value of prizes,
the class of stakes to be run, what
greyhounds should start In them and
the character of the penalty to be im
posed for violation of the rules. As
this left little authority for the park
owners or for the governing body of
the sport they made a stand for the
right to conduct their -business in their
own way.
It Is claimed by the members of the
association that certain proceedings
which precipitated the trouble were
not taken in their meetings. The of
ficials are charged with having ex
ceeded their authority, especially in
suspending certain men, thus making
It Impossible for them to run dogs-
The trouble arose originally over the
payment of a 25-cent admission at the
Union Park gate when the John Grace
cup was run. This admission has been
exacted for ten years and the money
added by the park was based on a cer
tain take at the gate. Five of the
many owners who paid were singled
out for punishment. The park insisted
on their paying and the association
then asked the park officials to. punish
these men for paying.
The park officials have refused to en
tertain this request and .have an
nounced they will not accedt to it if
there is never a blanket taken off a
greyhound in California.
With one park . running ; one day a
week at this season only fifty-six dogs
can be accepted each week. One hun
dred and twelve dogs can be, run in
two days and 168 in three days. As
there are more than three hundred
/dogs in regular training a large num
ber must be left out each week. This
means the poorer dogs will be a burden
to their owners. It has been said of
horseracing that it is the greatest sport
in the world and the worst business.
The same applies to coursing. The
man who depends on a few greyhounds
earning him a livelihood is on the
wrong tack. Competition is keen and
the favor of the hare or some trivial
thing brings about the defeat of a dog
considered a sure winner.
The coursing at Union Park.to-mor
row will be provided by two stakes, a
class and a reserve. Judge P. 'J. Rellly

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY; DECEMBER 10,, 1904;
While Tommy Burns, Shaw and some
of the other old timers are absent this
winter, a more promising collection of
lightweights and apprentices were sel
dom seen on any race course than are
now assembled at Oakland track.
, "Big Bill" Knapp Is an established
favorite, for he has appeared on the lo
cal tracks In â  past seasons. Knapp's
honesty has never been questioned, and
he is assured of a welcome from the
crowds, when first past the wire astride
a winner. . -
Gene Hildebrand, the new idol of the
turf, rode a few races. here soon after
the inception of the racing season,
when he departed for Los Angeles. He
is tinder contract to ride the horses
owned by "Plunger" Joe Teager. ' .
From obscurity W. Davis sprang into
prominence with a single bound on the
New York tracks the past summer. The
services of Davis were secured by W.
B. Jennings for the California winter
campaign, and the youthful rider is
making good with a vengeance at Oak
land. He and Knapp head the list of
winning jockeys.
All of the old timers remember "Dare
Devil" Fitzpatrlck and much interest is
awakened in the progress of his son,
now under contract to ride for Jimmy
Coffey. Some days ago "Fitz" had a
severe fall while piloting Ocyrohe in a
race, and has been on the ground for a
time. ; .
, Possibly the efforts of "Mickey" Me-
Laughlin lack polish and are yet in the
rough, but Mickey is persevering and
deserves to meet with success. One of
his faults is eagerness to reach the wire
in too great a hurry, but this may not
be such a great fault after all. . --.\
Sam Greenfield is another "youngster
who Is bound to make a name for him
self. Travers and Larsen ' are fast
reaching the top rung of , the ladder.

a paucity of riding talent. "" '

FOR DOUBLES TOURNAMENT
Enthusiasts of Golden Gate Park
Have No Games Scheduled.
Standing of California Club Members
Aside from the continuous tennl3
tournament the only event of any size
or importance scheduled for this
month is the scratch doubles tourna
ment to be played Christmas day on
the California Club courts. The
Golden Gate Club will hold no tourna
ments until after the first of the year.
The boys of the Junion Club will prob
ably play each week, while the ladies
will meet once before the end of the
year: i
In the Christmas day tourney all of
the California Club cracks will com
pete- The affair will prove unusually
interesting because of the fact the
players will draw for partners. It has
not as yet been decided whether the
players will be divided into two sec
tions. ThiB would result in a good
and a poor player joining forces. Most
of the players seam to favor the
straight draw, arguing that as it is to
be a game of chance, make it such as
far as possible.
The continuous tournament is prov
ing popular and the players are taking
a great interest in It. The event was
started last Sunday, but already there
have been numerous changes. Many
challenges are posted on the board
and many more will go up to-day and
to-morrow, when a number of matches
will be played.
The tournament is a novelty to most
of the players, who are somewhat con
fused as to the rules. It will be neces
sary for the tournament committee to
post a set of well-deflned rules on the
bulletin board if things are to run
smoothly.
The first two men to change places
were Will Collier and B. F. NourseJ
They met on Sunday and Collier won
In straight sets. He is now No. 4,
while Nourse goes back to No. 5.

Sportsmen Find IdBaL Shooting ' Conditions
The sportsmen who find their chief
pleasure at this season of the year in
the exhilarating pastime of duck-shoot

enjoyed last Sunday and of the promise
of more to come. T*he future sport,
however, hinges on the weather. That
of the past week was Ideal until the
rain came. A continuance of the rain
will tend to scatter the ducks. If the
rain keeps off the shooting is expected
to prove the best in many years, the
ducks working well for the guns in
cold, clear weather.
The northern flight of canvas backs

birds are found in great numbers in
Tomales Bay, Point Reyes, Sulsun and
Richardson's Bay. " The honkers and
gray geese are also here in numbers,
which indicate they were driven out of
the north by the extreme cold.
Al. Cumming had a great shoot on
Wednesday, of which some of his
friends received reminders in the shape
of some splendid mallards. The birds
were big and fat and in fine condition.
William Wattles secured a bag of
thirty birds on Tuesday near Collins

ninety birds, made up of "cans," mal
lard and sris.
The shooting around San Pablo
was excellent. W. L. Gerstle was one
of the fortunates to bring down fifty
birds.
E. J. Kaplan spent Monday at Colu
sa. He says the geese were so num

were moving about in countless
thousands. The ducks were also seen
in great numbers.
A sportsman recently returned from,
Mendota, Fresno County, says he
thought all the sprig in the world
were feeding on the overflowed lands
down there from the vast number ho

BIG SHIPYARD
IN DIFFICULTY
Company That Built Cruiser
Denver Places Affairs in
the Hands of a Keceiver
PHILADELPHIA, Dec. S.â John W.
Grange to-day was appointed receiver
for the Neafle & Levy Shipbuilding
Company, one of the oldest concerns of
the kind in the country. The company
recently completed the cruiser Denver.
It is understood that the financial loss
on work for the Government caused the
embarrassment of the company.
The company's attorneys say that the
assets of the concern far exceed the lia
bilities, but are not at present avail
able. The concern will be rehabilitated
and continue business as heretofore.
The Neafle & Levy Company has
done and is doing much work for the
Lnited States Government. The pro
tected cruiser St. Louis Is now two
thirds completed. Besides this thecom
?? n K> M C i. eEtly rece i v *d contracts for
the building of three steel tugs for the
Government. The company has built
fÂ£T e J a^. tc " rpedo boats an(J recently fin
ished the cruiser Denver. The plant is
also doing much private work
â¢ The money expended on the construe
Â« of the St. Louis, which will event
ually b e returned to the company when
the Government pays for the cruiser, is
given as the principal cause for tha
present difficulties.

FOR IMPORTANT RING ENGAGEMENT IN THE PAVILION WITH JUMMY BRITT
THE WINNER OF WHICH WILL BE HAILED AS THE LIGHTWEIGHT CHAMPION
FOUNTAIN'S VICTORY ON HOOLIGAN IS POPULAR
BY FRED E. MULHOLLAND.
When Lloyd Fountain came breeding
past the judges on his father's two
ycav-tKu Hooligan, winner of the ihird
event , at Oakland yesterday, he re
ceived an ovation almost equal to that
tendered the successful horse and rider
in an American Derby.
Hooligan was backed down in the
â  betting trom fours to 2r4 to 1 favorit
ifin. and threo furlongs from the stand
a ticket on him looked about as valu
able as a return door check at Spider
Kelly's ball; Absolutely last, younj;
Fountain began throwing out ballast,
scaring around the bunch entering the
stretch, and soon after he drew his
Â« hip.
One by one he passed al! but Bull
ir.an on Squire Johnson. For an instant
it looked as if the veteran mi&ht out
.finish the younger rider, but Hooligan
eimply tim armed in first, winning by a
length going away. The big crowd then
cheered the winner for nearly five min
utes. . From a grood beginning out in
front Smithy Kane, the opening favor- j
lie. faded to nothing.
FAST TIMi: IS MADE.
Although the rain left the track in a |
â¢loppy condition, the time for a couple |
of the races was remarkably fast. Fa- |
vorites fared badly. Hooligan alone
scoring.
Probably the defeat of Garnet Fer
guson's colt The Mighty, after having
a. row of nine straight victories to his
credit, caused the greatest surprise.
The Mighty ruled favorite for the flve
furlong scramble, and finished second j
to the two-year-old Pelham, a 10 to 1
Â£hot. The latter, cleverly handled by
Kunz. raced A. B. Cook off his leg?.
e,nd with a severe shaking up opposite
the j>addock downed the first choice a
couple of lengths. Show honors went
to Andrew B. Cook.
Gil Summers tried blinkers on Robert
Mitchell. At odds of 12 to 1 and rid
den by Larsen. the colt took the open
ing rprint for maiden two-year-olds,
buck-jumping from Rossbourne. Tho.
Jatter's price dropped from 10 to 6.
Fisher Boy, a 30 to 1, shot, nosed
out Bearskin for the, show. Andvari,
the even money favorite, did not have
ppeed enough to carry him a quarter of
a mile.
IXVIN'G TORPEDO A WINNER.
Minder certainly did all he could to
put Allopath over the plate winner of
the mile and seventy -yard number. The
mare was heavily played at 6 to 5, and
after blazing the way for half a mile,
pave up the lead to old Flying Torpedo,
a- 9 to 1 chance. Helgesen on Galan
thus made a bid for ii in the stretch,
but Torpedo held him safe, winning
handily. The show went to Scherzo.
With Mansard scratched from the
lifth. Matt Hogan. the mount of Bull
man, was installed favorite. The old
gelding strung along with H. L. Frank
to the stretch, and then blew up, run
ning unplaced. H. L. Frank stood a
hard drive from the time the barrier
was released, only to be nosed out by
Davis astride Jiomiiine, the second
< hoic-e. Michaels brought Little Wally
along from the. rear, almost overhauling
the tiring leadens, losing by a head
only.
\V. Davis on G. W. Trahern von the
ci'ising number, a mile and a furlong
sailing run. by outfinishing Sherwood,
who piloted Royalty. Who-a Bill, which
was backed to favoritism, bled and
Travers pulled him up on the back
stretch. G.-\V. Trahern and Royalty
had it hammer and tongs the last six
teenth. Davis earning the verdict by a
neck. Michaels finis-hed third with the
poorly handled Major Mar.sir.

GIVES UP HOME
TO COVER LOSS
OAKLAND. Dec. P.â Because a trust
ed emdoye of the San Francisco Mint
proved false to his duty Frank A.
3>ach, Strnerintendent of the Mint, has
been forced to deed his Oakland home
to the Fidelity and Deposit Company
of Maryland to indemnify that corpora
tion in part for $30,000, which the com
pany was forced to pay to the United
States Government to make good the
stealings of \V. H. Dimmick, former
chief clerk of the Mint, now serving a
term in the penitentiary.
The surety company furnished bonds
for Dimmick, W. K. Cole, cashier of
the Mint, and Frank A. Leach, the
superintendent. VHien Dimmick's de
falcation was discovered it was com
pelled to make good the amount to the
Government. After settling with the
Government the Fidelity and Deposit
Company sued \V. K. Cole, the cashier
of -the Mint, on the ground that, as the
legal custodian of the money, he was
responsible fcr its loss. At the trial It
> as? shown that Cole was not the im
mediate custodian of the funds. The
company then held Mr. Leach respon
sible for the amount they had paid the
Federal Government over and above
the $5000 for which they had insured
Dimmick. or a balance of $25,000. In
irder to pay the full amount of this
â¦ laim Mr. Leach has deeded his home
in -this city to the company, the deed
being: placed on deposit pending the ac
tion of the Federal Government.
A similar case happened at the Car-
Fon.Alint twelve years ago. A deputy
defaulted and the suncrintendent was
forced to make Rood the amount to the
Government. At the last session of
ConKTC-ss a relief bill wclr passed re
â¢storins the money to the superintend
ent, but as he is now dead the money
wap raid to hi<? hoirs. It has been pro
posed that a similar bill be presented
4o Cnr.grevs for the relief of Mr..Leach.
6-s the sufl!:' clerk is now suffering
punishment for his crime.

San Francisco and Oakland Lodges
to Mooi This Afternoon at i
Idora Park. * I
OAKLAND. Dec. 9.â In order that j
the poor families of Oakland may en- j
joy some of the good things of Christ- |
mas time the officers of the San Fran
cisco and Oakland lodges of Elks will j
meet on the diamond at Idora Park
to-morrow to decide which is entitled
to the baseball championship of the
l>ay cities. Weather permitting, the
game will begin at 2:30 p. m. and the

crowd. Already more than 3000
tickets have been sold. The San Fran-?
I Cisco team will bring a large delega
tion of rooters from the Foggy City
to encourage them in their quest for
Oakland scalps.
The officers of the local lodge prom
ise to send the invaders home with a
goose egg at the close of the game.
Several Oakland Elks will dispense
peanuts and soda water at the game
I and will be reinforced by prominent
members of the San Francisco herd.
Both team's have been practicing
hard for the game and it should be
fast and snappy. John Partridge,
exalted ruler of San Francisco Lodge
No. 3. will pitch for his team, and
James M. Shanley. exalted ruler of
Oakland Lodge No. 171, will twirl for
the local aggregation. Charles Beck,
\ San Francisco, and J. H. Steiger. Oak-

NELSON IS AGAIN IN TRAINING
While Jimmy Britt is one of the easi
est boxers in the business to sign up
for a match, once he decides it is a de
sirable one, and is an easy 1 man to get
into the ring, managers always have
one struggle with him. This is in re
gard to the forfeit money boxers are
expected to post .guaranteeing their
appearance in the ring at the appoint
ed hour and at whatever weight is re
quired. JCelson's forfeit of $1000 guar
anteeing that he will be on hand on
the 20th inst. and a like amount that
he wlft not weigh more than 132
pounds is in the hands of, Harry Cor
bett, the stakeholder. He also has the
club's forfeit which guarantees to the
boxers that the fight will take place.
It begins to look as if Manager Cof
froth will have to give Britt laughing
gas. and while he is under its influ
ence extract the required amount from
his strong box. No one doubts Britt's
bona fides in the matter. It has un
doubtedly been inconvenient for him
to attend to this branch of his business
in connection with the other duties
which have occupied his time.
FINNIGAN IS NEARLY BEATEN
Eddie Kehoe Gives Bantam Champion the
Hardest Battle of His Career.^
The bantam boxing-championship
title of America nearly went a glim
mering last night at the Mechanics'
Pavilion annex when George Finnigan,
holder of the trophy, hooked up with
Eddie Kehoe. The latter was" a. sub
stitute and nobody conceded him a
chance. He cleverly matched-his'sci
ence and generalship against the- hur
ricane rushes of the champ, and the
majority of the spectators thought he
won. . : " â¢ j?;-> ;
' Vinnigan. though apparently in\the
best of form, did not fight as' he has
in the past.- He carried the battle- to
his man in every round, but Kehoe al
ways met the rushes, with a left. Jab,
and whenever an opportunity'present
ed itself he would bring' a right over.
Twice the champion nearly - went to
the carpet from one of these vicious
jolts. In turn, he would rush' Kehoe
into a corner and begin to pummel
him. Kehoe made a- fast finish and
was giving Finnigan a good tljno when
the gong sounded.; Although thedeci-

Four Favorites Lose to Delight of Bookies
'L.OS ANGELES, Dec. 9.â 6nly two
out of six favorites won at Ascot Park
to-day, and, as it consequence, the thir
teen books cleaned up a neat sum' on
the day's -racing. Salarlo was heavily
played to win the first race, but was
beaten out by Mi', bade, the second
choice, with Black Joe, â  an outsider,
third.
Bath Beach was. fancied for the sec
ond race.' but was never in the run
ning, Durbar, : at 6 to 1, winning easily
from Dorice, a SO to 1 shot, with Crigli
third.
Our Pride was successful in the third
race, easily defeating Cloche d'Or, the
favorite, with Winnifreda third.
Emperor of india was played as if
the race were run for the fourth. He
rewarded his backers by winning with
the greatest of ease from Diamante,
with Harbor third.
Requiter was a red-hot favorite for
the fifth race, closing at 1 to 2 and
winning handily from Tryon, with
Heather Honey, the second choice in
the betting, third...
The last race was the biggest upset
of the day. Hildebrand had his only
mount of the day on Tizen, which was
made a 1 to 2 choice and which was
never seriously in the running. Susie

The other parties to the agreement
feel that they, have acted\their part

conditions covering the match.
Britt did no/ training. yesterday, but
will he hard at work again to-day at
his Ocean Beach quarters. He has
been doing light exercise at the Olymp

over $60 of his monthly salary to his
wife, $30 to the money brokers and
use the balance to liquidate other
debts.
It was shown that he had not lived
up to his uromise and Commissioner
Parry suggested that he be dismissed
from the department, saying: "At the
rate of interest these brokers charge
Titus will never get out of "debt if he
stays in the department. Let him go
to work" elsewhere and look out for
his family and let these brokers who
have been robbing him get their
money as best they can."

ditions.
CLEAR THE DECKS FpR ACTION!
Rip-Snorting Long-Priced Winner!
I am going to unbottle to r day the jammiest good thing
that has been cut loose for the benefit of my clients to date.
He's a mud lark.
He has been consistently beaten on a dry. track recently,
and he has been prepared on the quiet with, a view to pulling
off this kiiling to-day.
The engineers of this coup are old hands at the game.
They know the racing business backwards.
They make it their affair to know all about the fitness of
each horse in the race for which their candidate is pointed,
and they always know when their horse is properly placed.
This horse has worked faster than any horse that will'
go to the post in any event to-day. He always races as well
as he works.
He is in with' a feather on his back. At the weights, he
would not have to be half as ready as he is ta win galloping
this afternoon.
lo-to i was laid against him last night in out-of-town
poolrcoms throughout the country. A good big fat price
should, rule against his chances this afternoon.
This is* a spot where you can unbelt for the limit, with
about ninety-nine chances in favor of your winning to one
chance of losing. -
I seldom use language as strong as this, and you will
easily understand the significance.
If you have delayed coming into my fold, to-day is the
proper time to commence. Come in and get yours. It's a
pick-up!
I never knew of anything that appeared to be surer in a
horse race at the price than this one will be.
. I stake my reputation on him gathering the shekels.

Supervisors Change Game Law?.
SANTA ROSA. Dec. 9.â The Board
of Supervisors thl? afternoon rescind
ed the game ordinance relating to
ducks and enacted an ordinance mak
ing the State law prevail with the ex
ception of placing a bag limit of twen
ty-five. This gives the right to sell
and purchase ducks in the open mar
ket, which was prohibited by the for
mer ordinance. The action was pre
cipitated by the. discussion of the mat
ter before the board on Tuesday,
when many citizens appeared and
asked that they be given the right to
buy and sell ducks. The people of
Sonoma County were unanimous in
this desire. The Supervisors may pro
hibit the baiting of ponds and sloushs
by the gun clubs, as this is objection
able to the country sportsmen.

T. McQuade and C. Skelly were made
trustees. Samuel Kankin, the retir
ing 1 financial secretary, was asked
to accept the position for another
term, but as he has attended to tha
money affairs for the association for
the past ten years he tendered his re
fusal and would tiot permit his name
to be placed upon the ballot.

POWDER TRUST
PREVENTS SALE
Restrains Disposal of Its
Stock in the Peyton Com
pany for an Assessment
The powder trust, otherwise the E. I.
du Pont de Nemours Powder Company,
obtained a restraining order from
Judge Kerrigan yesterday which pre
vents the sale, advertised for this
morning, of $300,000 worth of the trust's
stock in the Peyton Chemical Company
for a $30,000 delinquent assessment. An
order was made for the local company
to show cause next Friday why the
injunction should not be made perma
nent and why its books and records
should not be opened for the inspection
of the New Jersey corporation.
The orders were not granted until after
a lively bout between six lawyers in an
ex parte proceeding. The defendant
was represented by Judge Slack, Judge
Allen and Attorney Serf, the plaintiff
by Attorneys Barrett, Madison and Su
tro. The case has been before Judge
Morrow in the United States Circuit
Court. A restraining order Issued by
him was dissolved a few days ago,
whereupon relief was sought In the Su
perior Court. In order that the defend
ants might not suffer, the plaintiff of
fered a bond of $35,000, which was ac
cepted.
The complaint relates that the New
Jersey company is the owner of 3000
of the 6500 shares of the Peyton Com
pany. In August the plaintiff gave a
power of attorney to R. S. Penniman
and asked that fifty of its shares be
transferred to his name. This was re
fused, as were also his repeated re
quests for permission to examine the
Peyton Company's books. It was con
tended that the Nemours Company,
without an access to the books, could
not determine whether or not it should
protect the stock assessed for $10 a
share. It is charged that the knowledge
of the company's affairs is fraudulent
ly withheld and that the refusal to
transfer the shares to Penniman was to
prevent the New Jersey company from
being represented on the board of di
rectors. The complaint says that the
directors of the Peyton Company are.
under thÂ« control of William C. Pey
ton.
Replying to these statements, the at
torneys for the defendant said that the
assessments, amounting to 133,000, had
been paid on the local stock; that the
application of Penniman for permis
sion to inspect the books was for the
purpose of injuring the company, and
that the New Jersey concern could not
maintain an action in the California
courts, not having complied with the
law requiring the filing of copies of its
articles of incorporation.
CIGAR STAND RAIDED.â A cigar stand at
618% Fourth street was raided yesterday by
order of Captain Splllane, who had informa
tion that the place was a gambling resort for
young men. Fourteen visitors and the proprie
tor were arrested.

Affr the violent rally of yesfrfiay afternoon
Â»Â« wet to be expected that there should be

fend Inflation to nil. There was also the
nutura.! uneai-inwB as to the depth of the
â¢round* Inflicted yesterday and the possible
c.n.Â«r-cuÂ»nr*>Â«. All of thÂ«>*e wÂ»>re contrlbut-
Inc c&uees to the nervous/break in prices In
to-<!ayÂ« early market, in which the losses ran
from 1 ' to 2U r>olntB In an extended list of
important properties. The rÂ»<-overy promptly
eet In as soon ar it m-ae announced that ell
*h*ets had gone through the Stock Exchange
rifAring-hiwse successfully, that being equiva
i*nt to an ar.r.wncÂ«rr.er.t that all financial em
barrassments hsd JÂ»e*n avoided. ThÂ»re was
hesitation and dullness when the recovery had
reached about last aisht's cloFics; level axaln.
But the lieht pressure to eell at thÂ» recov
ered â  leve-l of prires encouraeÂ«d cpeculattve
â¢rtitimpnt said induced to 'much confidence
that.pric** were pushed upward again agcres
aively with aoma evidence of a resumr.tion of
riÂ«r>ra.tlons by epeculetive pool*. In Bplte of
yesterday's severe lesson. Money proved to be
tn plentiful eupply and the rate for call loans
fell back racily. The severe discrimination
arainwt sora* securities as collateral, which
Â»'aÂ« a factor in breaking the market yester
day, was B-jmewiiat relaxed. The announce
ment of tb* â¦TiM^ement of $5o<i.000 KOld in
Parts for importation had an eT^ct on senti
ment, althouch the curious cross currents of
the present gold movemrr.t are E*en to be quita
aiJart from the orridltlon of the rxrhange mar
ket. T^e ease of the call-money market was
accMUed as a better Index of the extent of
the liquidation yesterday than will be given
by to-morroWp bank statement, which prob
stbljr will reflect the loss of carh du* to gold
exports and trar*rerÂ» to the Interior through
â¢ the Subyeasury and only ellKhtly the loan
contraction, owing to the operation of the av
Â»ras#> pygfTn of computation. The Missouri
Pacific bond sales and the- estaWlshment of
dividends on f^outhem Pacific preferred were
helps toward reviving speculative fspirits. Be
fore the end of the day the declines had been
.transformed lrto gains of I to 2 '4 for the
I>rincii>eJ active stocks. The tains' were not
fully held and the doling was rather eacy.
Bond* turned firm after some early de
clines. Total sales Â»par value). $5,335 000

Future Grain and Provisions.
CHICAGO, Dec. !'.â The wheat market was
laigely swayed by the leadership of a few
strong interests, nearly every influential trans
action oelng credited to a house with Eastern
connections or to prominent local leaders.
.Traders at the outset seemed Inclined to favor
the bear side. Cables reported . Argentine
weather fine and harvest progressing favor
ably. May quotations showed an initial loss
of l .irtr4c at $1 10%@l 11. and with tree
oiietlngs there was a further recession to
$1 10%. The selling tendency was furthered
by rain and snow in the Southwest and by a
heavy run of wheat at Minneapolis and Du
luth. In the face of this bearlshness, how
ever, prices rallied on buying said to be for
short account, advancing to 51 11*4. The
strength was only temporary, however, and
was followed by another break. May touching

The feature in corn was the alarm that
apparently had seized December shorts. The
rluMng was firm, with May =i t , ( 34c higher
at 4 4 T s if? 45c.
Oats were a shade firmer with corn. May
closed \%q up at 30%c. . / .
The provision market was active and strong,
with a good general demand. May pork 13

The Poultry market was well supplied, quiet
and weak, and aside from an advance In
dressed Turkeys, all descriptions stood as pre

the bulk of the large receipts of Game during j

Butter continued steady yesterday. The pre
dicted rain came "along on time, but It wa* j
light and did not produce any appreciable !
effect on the market. Some dealers were dls- ,
posed to quote prices up, to 22c. while others
opposed this procedure on the ground that any
advance would Immediately shut off the few j
shipping order* now being received and set J
the market back Into bad shoe* again. It was j
largely a question of stocks and shipping j
orders.

BENEFIT SHOW
IS BIG SUCCESS
The talent and the parts that are
talked about, the drawing cards that
each theater boasts of, all the brilliant
things to be seen in San Francisco's
playhouses at the present time, were
brought together at the Orpheum yes
terday afternoon in a performance that
In variety and excellence was the
acme of theatrical entertainment. Seats
were sold at $2 and $1, but the show
was worth far more than that, not to
speak of the opportunity to help the
benefit fund for needy actor folk. The
Theatrical Managers' Association, un
der whose auspices the benefit was
given, had done Its planning and
culling well, the stage people exerted
themselves earnestly in their work of
love and sympathy, and the result was
that the big audience enjoyed a treat
such as is rarely presented.
The programme was long. Madame
Fannie Francisca was there with the
others of the Tivoli's sextet from
"Lucia di Lammermoor." Williams
and Walker, the colored comedians,
came from the Grand with their fetch
ing "stunts." Mary Shaw, Sam Elton
and Dillon brothers of the Orpheum
gave the best the vaudeville house has
on the boards this week. James Ed
ward Britt forsook the training camp
to help out as a monologist.
The William H. West Minstrels
opened the afternoon with an excellent
suggestion of what they are doing at
the California. The end men had good
things to say and the singing and danc
ing were of the kind to cause applause.
Marguerite Le Roy, colorature soprano,
and SIgnor Gulielmo Riccl, violin vir
tuoso, seemed even better than in their
usual part at the Orpheum. Next came
the thrill of the trial scene of Robert
Emmet as performed at the Central,
with Hersuhell Mayall as the martyr.
Harold Forman. the remarkable boy
soprano at the Alcazar, was compelled
to respond to an encore. Duke Johnson
and Mae Wells, who are at the Chutes
danced and sang delightfully.
Miss Dora de Fillippe of the Tivoll
received her share of floral tributes and
applause. In original specialty Willard
Simms of the Tivoli distinguished him
self as a funmaker. The Orpheum con
tributed another number from its bill
that of Frank and little Bob, who do
acrobatic turns in which a dog takes a
prominent part.
"The Professor's Love Story," by the
Alcazar Stock Company, with John
Craig in fine fettle and every .girl a
picture of loveliness, closed the per
formance.
One of the most attractive features
of the occasion was the selling of pro
grammes by a bevy of beautiful young
actresses, who aided the cause mate
rially. These youngr women included
Miss Marian SUgreaves, Miss Dolly
Wray. Miss Ella Kearney, Miss Edna
Pendleton, Miss Belle Dale, Miss Marie
Mallory and Miss Edith Varney of the
Tivoll Opera Company; Miss Hazel Els
mere and Miss Georgia Clifton, from
the Central Theater,- and Miss Mabel
Douglass, from the Alcazar.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, DECEMBER 10. 1904.
MAY BE NAMED
COMMISSIONERS
At Least Four Incumbents,
Whose Terms Expire, Are
Sure of Eeappointment
OTHERS ARE MENTIONED
Gossip Puts Metson on Park
Commission and Keeps
Casey on the Works Board
The terms of eight municipal Com
missioners will expire on January S and
gossip is already rife regarding the in
tentiuns of Mayor Schmitz In the mat
ter of appointments to the vacancies.
The Mayor himself has been reticent
on the subject, but although exactly
one month still remains of the current
terms the signs indicate the reappoint
ment of four or live of the incumbent
Commissioners.
Ihe members of the boards and com
missions whose terms are about to end
and who uppear to be absolutely cer
tain of reappointment are: Aaron Alt
inann, member of the Board of Educa
tion; Henry M. Wreden, Fire Commis
sioner, and Dr. Joseph H. Poheim,
member of the Board of Health. To
these three may be added the name of
A. W. Voorsanger, who seems to be
reasonably sure of again being named
as a member of the Board of Election
Commissioners.
opinion is divided as to whether
Michael Casey will be reappolnted- to
succeed himself on the' Board of Pub
lic Works. The Mayor, has never for
given Casey for deserting him and
forming an alliance with ex-Commis
sioner of Public Works Marsden Man
sc/n, when the latter was a member of
the board in 1902. However that may
be, it is whispered on what appears
plausible foundation that the Mayor is
willing to relent in Casey's case in the
event that certain influences are
brought forward in his behalf. Casey
has been real good since his original
defection from the Mayor's cause, and
now that he is in the minority on the
board his reappointment is very much
within the sange of probability.
Thft term of Park Commissioner
Frank J. Sullivan will also expire and
gossip suggests the name of William
H. Metson as Sullivan's successor. Met
son was Park Commissioner just be
iore the new charter went into effect.
He was the only one on. the board who
was not reappointed by Mayor Phelan
in 1900. Metson is a Democrat, an at
torney of high standing and his ap
pointment now would be in the nature
of a slap at the influences which pre
vented his appointment in 1900.
There does not appear to.be any well
defined guess as to the probable succes
sor to J. H. Howell, whose term as
Police Commissioner ends next month,
although it Is said that Jeremiah A.
Dineen, a contractor and a close friend
erf Mayor Schmitz, can have the office
if he wants it. Others who are men
tioned for the post are: Dr. George I.
Drucker, ex-School Director and ex-
Grand Juror, and Fred Hilbert, al
though the Mayor has been heard 1 to
remark that he did not desire to ap
point any more liquor men cm th,e com
missions. Hilbert is in that line of
business, but he, too, is a particular
friend of Schmitz.
The term of Civil Service Commis
sioner John W. I Rogers also expires
January 8. He could undoubtedly be
reappdnted, but he has his eyes on
more remunerative positions, one of
which he hopes to secure through the
good offices of E. A. Hayes, Congress
man-elect. Rogers wants to succeed
the late George Morse as clerk of the
United States District Court or he may
go to Washington, D. C, as Hayes'
secretary. In either event a, vacancy
on the Civil Service Board will exist
for which gossip fails to suggest a
name unless it be George Benham,
president of the Labor Council, who
has several times been considered for
appointment on commissions by the
Mayor, but for some reason was never
selected when the crucial moment ar
rived.

MINER'S BRIDE REPLIES
Says Toriopah Man Is Too
Old and Big* and Cruel.
Rich Contractor Accused
The quietude of a Newcastle orchard
home was frequently disturbed by j
Herbert Falk's love for drink and his !
penchant for brandishing a revolver,
according to the complaint for divorce
filed yesterday by his wife, Cora, whom
he married nine years ago at Santa |
Cruz. Four months after their mar
riage, she says, he took to drinking, !
and for seven years has consumed two â¢
bottles of whisky on three nights week- j
ly, t a total of 2184 bottles. She says i
that in his drunken frenzies he threat
ened her life with revolvers, rifles and
shotguns, and once when he tried to
shoot her the pistol went off in time j
to shoot him in the leg. She says that J
he shot at her dogs and once shot and
killed the horse he was driving. The
orchard and farm are worth $12,500 and
he has an income from other sources of j
$100 a month.
A big difference in weight and age
seems to have destroyed love's young'
dream for Nettie Runge and Christ
Runge, a Tonopah mining man. They |
were married on October 4 last. She j
was 18 years old and weighed 120
pounds; he was 45 and weighed 200. A
few days ago he sued for divorce on
the ground that she treated him harsh
ly and said she did not love him. Yes
terday .she filed a cross-complaint,
charging him with cruelty. She says
that when she tried to leave him at the '
International Hotel in this city on
October 30 he forced her to remain, and j
used a 44-caliber revolver. Mrs. Runge '
says her husband has been in theTono- j
pah mines for five years and has prop
erty worth from $50,000 to 5100,000 and:
that his income is $10,000 a year. She '
asks for $250 a month alimony, $200
costs and $1000 counsel fees. Judge Ker
rigan has restrained Runge from dis
posing of his property.
Freda Duebel, wife of Charles A.
Duebel, a contractor, has revolted from J
twenty-nine years of alleged cruelty j
and sues for divorce. They were mar- i
ried in 1875, and she says that she haa j
been mistreated ever since, the climax!
being reached on November 12, when, |
she says, he knocked her down. She j
says that when they wedded she gave j
him $700 of her earnings with which â¢
to go into business, and he has since \
built up a fortune in realty, money I
and securities amounting to at least
$60,000. She demands her share.
Harriet H. Hubbell, whose husband,
Dr. G. R. Hubbell, is suing her for di
vorce, has applied to the court for $100
a month as alimony pending the trial!
of the case. She says he earns $350 a '
month from his practice. \i\
Dinah Reid has sued for the annul
ment of her marriage with William J.
Reid, which took place at San Rafael
on May 16. 1901. A month before she

GOOD PROFITS
IN PARK NEWS
The little publication known as the
Park News, which contains the pro
gramme and Is distributed at the Sun
day concerts In Golden Gate Park, haa
been netting a profit of $3000 a year to
those who held the privilege of printing
It. The municipality has been receiving
but $100 a month from the concession,
and the Commissioners were much sur
prised at the Information developed at
the inquiry they held last night Into
charges that bidders were in collusion
at the recent award. The evidence ad
duced was sufficient to justify Commis
sioners Spreckels, Lloyd, Dlngee and
Cummings in rejecting all bids and is
suing a new call. The contract has not
been closed with Quirk Brothers, who
offered the highest amount for the priv
ilege. :â¢;â  h.;
The profits from the advertisements
in the publication have heretofore been
successfully concealed, but full light
was gained at last night's meeting. It
is expected that printers, now apprised
of the opportunities for money making,
will compete for the concession, to the
material advantage of the city.
The bids for issuing the concert pro
gramme and publication were opened
in October. Phillips & Van Orden, who
have had the contract, offered $100 a
month, .the amount they have been
paying the city. O. H. Smyth, who was
a member of that firm until recently,
bid $120 a month. Quirk Brothers of
fered $155. Subject to an Investigation
as to whether or not they were a re
sponsible firm, the privilege, was
awarded, to Quirk Brothers. They have
been printing the News during No
vember, but the contract has never
been signed by the Commissioners.
. Smyth made the accusation that
Quirk Brothers were In collusion with
Phillips & Van Orden, and alleged that
the successful bid was prepared by
Phillips & Van Orden and that the
latter, firm plans to perform the con

HUSBAND FINDS
HIS WIFE DEAD
Warned by a strange premonition
something he could not explainâ
Amandus Repsold. the well-known
wine merchant, returned to his home.
632 Cole street, yesterday to find his
wife dead. She had been afflicted with
heart trouble for several years, and It
is believed that the disease caused her
death.
Soon after Mr. Repsold left his homo
something told him that all was not
well. He -was about to telephone and
assure himself that nothing had hap
pened to his wife, but the warning was
so strong that he boarded a car with
a friend and rode out to the house. He
opened the door, thinking to surprise
Mrs. Repsold. He found her sleeping.
as he thought, on a lounge. He called
her name. There was no answer. He
spoke to her in a louder tone and
caught her by the arm. Then he real
ized that the mysterious premonition
he had received was true. His wife
was dead.
The body of Mrs. Repsold was taken
to the morgue. Though there is noth
ing to indicate that she did not die
of natural causes, an autopsy will bo
performed to-day. Friend3 say she
wag despondent at times and may
have committed suicide In a moment of
suffering. Mrs. Repsold was a native
of Germany, aged 33 years. She was
a daughter of Mrs. Philip Mailer, the
well-known singer.
