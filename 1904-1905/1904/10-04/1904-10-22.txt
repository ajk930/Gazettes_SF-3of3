the exclusion of the liquor. traffic. from
the proposed new State into which In

COLON, Colombia, Oct. 2Lâ News reached here this evening that about
200 armed men, who are thought to be malcontent Panamaians, rather. than
Colombian soldiers, have been seen in the neighborhood of Culebra, threat
ening hostilities against the Panamalan Government.
As soon as the American authorities of the canal zone became cogni
zant of this force marines were sent out to ascertain their purpose.
It is rumored that a skirmish occurred inland, in which several were
killed, but there is no confirmation of this report.
WASHINGTON. Oct. 21.â Assistant Secretary Darling to-night said that
bo far as knew no advices had been received at the Navy Department of the
reported skirmish between United States marines and Panamaians on the
Isthmus. If any dispatches have been received, the Assistant Secretary ex
plained, they in all probability would be sent direct to the department and
â¢would not be delivered to the officials until,morning. At this time the navy
had about 450 marines on the Isthmus, a sufficient force, in the opinion of
the administration, to cope with any difficulty which is likely to develop.
American marines will be retained on the Isthmus of Panama
for the present, prepared to meet any emergency which may arise/
Orders have been issued for a new battalion of marines to go to the
Isthmus about November 15 to relieve the battalion which has been there for
a year. The new battalion' will be commanded by Lieutenant Colonel
Thomas N. Wood.
That the situation on the isthmus is not all that could be" desired is the
news which came to Washington yesterday in a personal letter' from an offi
cial now in Panama. While the Panama Government is entirely loyal, it
Fecms that there are certain disgruntled elements In the isthmus and in view
of the ease with which revolutions are started in Central and South Amer
ica, It is the official opinion here that the marines should remain there for
the present.

LONDON, Oct. 12. â According to
the Constantinople correspondent of
the Daily Telegraph.- Kurds have
burned twenty houses In the village of
Marek. near Van. and killed over thir
ty Armenians.
LONDON. Oct. 22.â The . Standard's
Yentai correspondent, telegraphing on
October 15, describes in detail the final
stages of the Shakhe River battle, and
incidentally refers to the danger which
temporarily threatened Field Marshal
Oyama's right nearBensihu, where the
Russians, In overwhelming force, near
ly succeeded In turning the Japanese
right and Isolating the men sent to
protect Oyama's right wing. He says
it was the indomitable courage and en
ergy of ' the Japanese infantry that
saved the situation. .
Detailing the struggle of October 13,
south of the Shakhe River, the corre
spondent pays a tribute to the desper
ate courage of the Russians, who de
fended their positions with the great
est gallantry. The Japanese .infantry,
he says, again had the task of carrying
a formidable position by supreme effort
and self-sacrifice. The slope up which
they. crept was swept by a storm of
bullets. The thin, dark line wavered
under the blast, and broke and scat
tered back down the hill, but a handful
of heroes rallied and rushed headlong
up the slope, halted, re-formed 'and
dashed on again, their niumbers being
lessened with every foot they advanced,
and once again they were swept back
in confusion down the hillside. But
they had shown the way to others.
Another company pushed forward with
Its left well thrown back. Again vol
leys crashed out, but this time un
availingly against the desperate head'
long rush, and the : Indomitable little
men gained the summit.
The Russians rose to -their feet, the
ranks closed and ( rifle and bayonet
were at work in, one wild melee. It
was only for a moment and, shaken
by the courage of the Japanese, ' the
Russians' broke and fled to their com
rades below, already in retreat. The
assault and defense alike were a bril
liant feat of arms In which . the gal
fantry of the Russians ; was ; surpassed
only . by the devoted >; courage of the
Japanese infantry.
The Russians fell back to a range of
low hills bordering the Shakhe River,
whence on , the " 14th, ' the Â¦ artillery, fail
ing to dislodge them, the Japanese
drove them in the afternoon by a
magnificent spectacle of disciplined war
involving terrible carnage, pursuing
them down to the very 'banks of ; the
Shakhe River. ' ;.
The same correspondent, .under date
of October 17, says: j \
' "General Kuropatkin- appears to; be
â¢ preparing to hold the plain in frontYoJt
I Mukden. He is concentrating troops
| and strengthening; his defense 'works

ST. PETERSBURG, Oct. 21, 5:39
p. m.^-General Sakharoff telegraphed

Admiral Wiren is now in command

Is still at Port Arthur, but not at
tached to any ship.
Satisfactory reports have been re
ceived by the admiralty of the progress
made by the Baltic fleet. The stoppage
off the Swedish coast within a few
days of leaving a home port was due
to the necessity for filling up the
bunkers for the long trip through the
North Sea to the Atlantic, where the
fleet will not find convenient coaling
points.
Neither the next stopping nor the
route has been revealed. These points
are covered by Vice Admiral Rojest
vensky's sealed orders* which, however,
it is known, give wide latitude in this
matter.
The Bourse Gazette's Mukden cor
respondent, wbo yesterday reported a
series of victorious engagements and a
Japanese retreat, to-day Bays there has
been no fighting for three days. He
adds that the Japanese are displaying
great activity and says a Japanese
prisoner declared they are preparing to
retire along the whole line. The cor
respondent further asserts that three
more Japanese guns were captured
during the night raid of October 19.

RUSSIAN MINISTER OF THE INTERIOR WHOSE RECENT ORDER REMOV
ING BAN AGAINST COLORS FOR STUDENTS* CAPS 13 CONSIDERED AS
FURTHER EVIDENCE OF THE CONCILIATORY "POLICY OF RUSSIA. ' -
QUIKT AT PORT ARTHUR.
The fact that the First and Fifth Si
berian Corps are the only corps hitherto
unmentfemed in reports of the fighting
on October 19 shows that 'General
Kuropatkin has sent the reserves to the
trenches, giving other much tried corps
a thorough rest. Meanwhile the Cos
sacks are raiding the Japanese lines.
It developes that after the Lone Tree
Hill rout the Japanese were unable to
remove a number of cannon in addition
t& those left on the hill, and which re
mained midway between the Russian
and the Japanese trenches. * As they
lay, these guns were so exposed to fire
from both sides that it was impossible
for either side to get them during day
light and repeated attempts have been
made by both to secure the . guns at
dark. Up to the present Cossacks have
got three of the cannon. The dexterity
of the Cossacks in this sort of work
was repeatedly illustrated during the
Russian army maneuvres. On'one,oc
casion Â¦ they abstracted the artillery
harness, . disabling, all the batteries of
their rival combatants.
A dispatch from Mukden to the Asso
ciated Press reports that the Russians
yesterday confined 'themselves to a
bombardment of Shakhe Station and
the adjoining village of Lamatung, the
Japanese feebly responding. This
news shows that Shakhe Station is not
held by the Russians.
.Russian correspondents report that
some regiments of the Fifth Siberian
Corps have been engaged in slight
skirmishes on the advance line the past
few days.
ST. PETERSBURG, Oct. 22, 2 a. m.â
The rival armies of Russia and Japan,

NEW YORK, Oct. 21.â Bradstreefs
to-morrow will say:
Good feeling, in some instances close
ly approaching optimism, dominates the
general trade situation, but the under
tone is Avithal one c/f conservatism . and
there is a general desire to avoid over
trading. Past reports of good whole
sale trade are reflected in an increased
speeding of the wheels of industry, but
except in portions of the .West and
Siruthwest, where cool weather has
helped retail distribution, and in . the
South, where good prices for cotton in
duce free marketing of the crop, there
is a disposition to regard the weather
as too warm for best results in final
distribution. Railway earnings turned
the corner in August, the roads of the
country showing a gain of a fraction
of one per cent in gross and of five per
cent in net over 1903. Collections have
continued to hold the improvement
noted last week, being especially good
at the South.

and they have since /made frequent
overtures . to. him ' to return. In fact
they have kept the position of manager
open for him for nearly a ; year with
the hope of persuading him to return
and they finally ; obtained, the an
nouncement of his purpose to do so a
few days ago. .It was in anticipation
of 'Pollok's .return that. Wednesday's
meeting in j the .office of the gas com
pany was. called. . - r . - .
Fonseveral months a breach has ex
isted between the board of directors of
the hotel company and Manager Pol
lok and It was the realization that this
was gradually, widening that prompted
the manager to reconsider a proposition
received from "President "William B.
Bourn of the gas company to accept
his old position.
It is claimed by Pollok> friends that
his original agreement with the di
rectors of the. hotel â namely, that he
should have absolute control of the
hotel- in so far as its management is
concernedâ had been "violated by the dl-.
rectors, who are said to have frequent
ly taken issue with Pollbk on matters
pertaining. to the method of conducting
the establishment. Although the hotel,
from the day It opened, has proved it
self a remarkably good enterprise,', the
directors, it la said, have been continu
ally disputing with Pollok. -Finally the
weekly meetings became so inhar
monious that Pollok refrained from at
tending them and at last brought mat
ters to an issue by. resigning. While he
is not a director of the hotel company
Pollok owns a large share of the stock.
When he resigned Thursday the di
rectors offered him a place In the
directory, but this he is re
ported to have refused, and he has an
nounced to the directors that he will,
dispose of his stock. ,
Who will succeed Pollok in the hotel
is a matter 'not yet settled by the di
rectors, but they are negotiating with
several managers In the East and have
asked Pollok to remain with the hotel
until his successor is chosen. When
informed last evening that the news of
his resignation, which it had been in
tended to keep a secret for several
weeks,, had become known, Pollok de
clined to "discuss the matter, referring
his Interviewers to the presidents of the
hotel- and gas companies.

Mr. Kahn made vote-winning
speeches yesterday at the works of the
California Sugar Refinery and the
Tubbs Cordage Company's plant in the
Potrero. Both of these speeches were
restricted to the Question of "imperial-
Ism** as applied to' President Roosevelt
in the Democratic charge that he is
imperialism's advocate. Regarding this
Mr. Kahn said:
So far as the charge is concerned that Pres
ident Roosevelt is an advocate Â«of Imperial-
Ism, the fart elands that osder the adminis
tration of Tfceo<iore Roosevelt an American
citizen has been safer in foreign lands than
#ver before In ttoe history of the United States.
If Imperialism be the protection of American
Interests. American commerce. American citi
xtns abroad and thÂ« fostering , of the Ameri
can's right to exploit the marts of the world,
thtn Theodore Roosevelt is guilty of the charge
the DemocraTs. Is the absence of asy sane
and sotind Issue, choose to make in their des
perate effort to win votes at the coming elec
tion. Bat this Is not Imperialism, it Is what
Americans expect and demand and it has re
moved the necessity. Trhich I regret to say ex
irted during other administration?, of Ameri
can citizens caJHr-g cpon the diplomatic rep
resentatives of ether powers when they wanted
Justice in foreign lands. No American can
question the soundness of this policy. It
Julius Kahn is making an active and.
If Indications may be relied upon, a
winning campaign. Yesterday he ad
dressed several audiences and on each
occasion his views of the issues of the
campaign met with approval.
Mr. Kahn's strength lies in the fact
that he Is favored by all classes of peo
ple. He has enlisted the support not
only of politicians of his party but of
business men and workmen, with the
result that in every precinct of his dis
trict he has active and intelligent men
advocating his election. Investigation
eeems to develop the fact that his fight
Is already won and that for the next
two years the Fourth Congressional
District of California will lend Its aid
In the earning out of the Republican
policies that have brought prosperity to
the nation.
Resolved, That each and every member -of
the Julius Kahn Club pledge himself to use
erery honorable means to secure his election.
.Resolved. That the Fourth .., Congressional
Julius Kahn Club indorses the \ renomlnatlon
of Julius Kahn by the .Fourth Congressional
Convention as the best fitted candidate, > who
If elected, will best . represent the - interests
of the . laboring, manufacturing and business
interests of the city and , county of San Fran
circo; and be Jf further :
Whereas, The Fourth Congressional District
of San Francisco represents a majority of the
laboring, manufacturing and business Interests
of the city and county of San Francisco
therefore be It -
Reports were presented from dele
gates representing all the Assembly
districts embraced in the Fourth Con
gressional District, which showed that
Mr. Kahn would again be returned to
Congress by a large majority. :
More than 200 members signed the
roll. Speeches were made by M. J.'
Brady, J. J. Rock, M. J. Kilgallon,
James McCarthy, Joseph Anthony, M.
J. Fay, P. J. Kelleher, P. J. McLaugh
lin, T. Long and others. The following
resolution was unanimously adopted: "'
At the conclusion of Mr. Kahn's
speech he was enthusiastically cheered.
As he was leaving the hall Judge
Charles T. Conlan, Democratic nominee
for Judge of the Superior Court, ar
rived. He was called upon to make an
address, at the conclusion of which the
meeting adjourned.
The personal friends of Julius Kahn
met last evening at the Alcazar build
ing. , John Lackmann occupied the
chair and P. J. Kelleher acted as sec
retary.
We are upon the eve of another Presidential
election and I wiÂ»h to impress upon you that
election of the President alone is not sufficient.
In order that he may carry out Ills policies he
must have behind him a Congress that will aid
him in every way, not harass /Mm or defeat
his Intentions entirely, as a Democratic Con
gress would do. For this reason, If for no
other. I ask you to stand firm for the Repub
lican ticket 'and vote it straight through. It
will Insure for you a continuation of that pros
perity you hav e long enjoyed, and which you
are unwilling to part with In exchange for
the hard times Democratic dominancy will
usher In. â¢:"Â¦Â¦: Â¦:-. . -.â¢Â¦â¢â¢
Mr. Paduveri was followed by Frank
A. Markey, Republican and Union
Labor nominee for the Senate in the
Seventeenth District: Daniel W. Bur
chard. Republican and Union Labor
nominee for Superior Judge," and John
A Cullen, Republican and Union Labor
nominee for the Assembly in . the
Twenty-ninth District. At the conclu
sion of Mr. Cullen' s address Mr. Kahn
was Introduced to the members of the
club. He was warmly received and
immediately won his audience. In part
he said:
During the last reven and a half years â¢ of
Republican administration there , has been
plenty In the land; the prosperity 'of the na
tion has been greater than it had ever before
known And greater than any other â¢ nation on
earth has ever known. This has been due to
Republican administration â as the people know
after bitter exr>erfence under Democratic con
trol â and. under Republican administration this
prosperity will continue.
Mr. Hayes has for years been a prominent
citizen. Interested In the work of tha great
Republican party and seeking to foster good
tltteenship in our neighboring city of San
Jose. He Is a man of great ability and of
excellent character and will make a desirable
and trustworthy representative. Let us all
work and vote for Julius Kahn and E. A.
Hayes and we shall never rÂ«rret it.
In the evening Mr. Kahn waa the
principal speaker at an enthusiastic
meeting held by the Greek-American
Republican Club at B'nai "E'rith Hall.
The meeting: was largely attended and
was presided over by N. Valianos,
president of the club. One of the most
interesting speakers of the evening was
Felix Paduveri, secretary of the Greek
Consulate* who sounded a key note
when he said:
Our worthy and distinguished friend Mr.
Kahn must have his double; he must have irith
him some one to assist him who Is Just as
able and trustworthy and as /true Republican
as himself and with their combined efforts
ami their combined energies they can gain
much for California and this great city. Let
us then elect In the Fifth District our good
and true friend E. A. Hayes.

SISSON, Oct. 21. â The Republicans
held a meeting here to-night, which
was the banner gathering of the cam
paign. All "the principal streets were
ablaxe with light from the numerous
bonfires. Salutes were fired during
the evening. Odd Fellows* Hall was

crowd of enthusiastic people.
MARKEY CLUB ORGANIZED.
SISSON" GREETS GILLETT.
Resolved. That the Merchants' Association,
in order that the judiciary of this city and
county may be kept out of politics as far as
possible, and that the interests of civil ser
vice reform may be furthered to the greatest
extent, recommends the re-election of the
present Judges â Seaweil. Murasky, Kerrigan
and Troutt.- ~
Whereas, One of these principles Is that
a good man In an office where issues of poli
cy are not Involved should not be displaced
except through promotion, and
Whereas. Said principle Is the leading doc
trine of civil service reform, which the asso
ciation has always advocated, and
Whereas. Said doctrine of civil service re
form has no more direct and . vital applica
tion anywhere than in the case of the Judi
ciary, therefore be it
the candidacy of Judges Seawell. Mu
rasky, Kerrigan and Troutt:
Whereas, The Merchants' Association has
necessarily advocated and acted upon certain
principles that it believes to be essential to
the public welfare, and i
At the conclusion of this meeting
Livernash and Wynn went out to
Baden to deliver addresses there.
The Becond meeting was at Silk's
Hall, on -Precita avenue, near Mission
street. "Walter O'Oonnell presided.
Here Livernash spoke on practically
the same" lines as at the first meeting.
A fair crowd was in attendance. Ad
dresses were also made by Judge Con-
Ian and Frank Costello.
Livernaah spoke at great length
upon the subject of -trusts and espe
cially that portion of the trusts that
hits the farmer most directly. He had
a great deal to say about the cost of
harvesting machinery and the enor
mous profits that the manufacturers
of these machines are making, as he
averred, all due to the tariffs. The
money lords were responsible for. this
condition. "Only a change of admin
istration," he said, "could be an effec
tive repression of these trust abuses.
The Republican L partyv cannot ) be re
lied upon to deal with the trusts as
they should be dealt with. The Roose
velt administration is a trust adminis
tration, no matter how Mr. - Roosevelt
may feel about the trusts himself."
This present administration has taken
no important stand agaii.st "robber"
combinations except in the case. of the
famous or infamous so-called "mer
ger." He said:
"I think Mr. Roosevelt had better
not talk much about his anxiety to
protect the nation against the criminal
extortion of trusts until his department
of justice does something. He" might
with greater profit to the nation use
his energy in prodding his own Cabinet
officers into at least the semblance of
activity." i* *!
"William J. Wynn followed with a few
remarks.
Edward J. Livernash had - a . busy
time last night. He held forth at three
meetings. He spoke first at Strieker's
Hall, corner of Twenty-eighth and
Church streets. Walter Graham was
president of the meeting, which was a
large one.

DECRYING TRUSTS BEFORE THREE
MISSION DISTRICT AUDIENCES
Sergeant Tooley had a good record
in the army. He was burled at the
post cemetery this morning with mil
itary honors. Four negro soldiers.
Privates Brooks and Allen. Corporal
Smith and Sergeant Johnson, all of
the first squadron. Ninth Cavalry,
were concerned in the quarrel.
The evidence at the inquest showed
that the negro cavalrymen were In the
house when several white soldiers,
among them Sergeant Tooley, came
In. Tooley asksd one of the women
to dance with him and she refused,
whereat he spoke angrily to her. This
aroused one' of the negroes and im
mediately there was gunplay and sev
eral shots were fired. In the mixup
Tooley was mortally wounded and
died a few moments later. It appears
that all the shooting was- done by the
negro soldiers, as none of the white
men was armed.
An Inquest was held last night and
at a late hour the jury brought in a
verdict to the effect that Arthur Too
ley. a native of Indiana, about 24
years of age, came to his death by a
gunshot wound Inflicted unlawfully
by a colored soldier of the Ninth Unit

Resolved. That the thanks of this conven

Labor Union and the Building Trades Council
of St. .Lout?. Kansas City and other cities of
Missouri, and to the labor unions of Texas,
for their recent successes in defeating antl
scalping bills in their State Legislatures, and
especially recommend the St. Louis unions to
continue the good fight in resisting these ob
noxious 1 laws, ordinances and Injunctions

Resolved. That tkÂ» resolutions adopted at
each of the last six annual conventions of this
federation, denouncing anU-scalplng. Federal
and State antl-scalping laws, city ordinances
and injunctions, be reaffirmed.

federations, central trade and labor councils
and labor unions allied with the American
Federation of Labor to uÂ«e every effort to de

our legislative committee at Washington to
oppose all anti-scalplng bills that have been

Resolved." By the American Federation of
Labor in this, its twenty-third annual con

that It is an outrage to require the signatures
of purchasers on tickets. - We also protest
agaisst the. nuisance of Joint agencies an-!
other identification annoyances as an unnec

Whereas. Having signally failed In recent
years, because of the intense opposition by
organized labor to such measures, to pass
anti-scalplng bills in any of the States of the
Cr.Ion or in the United States Congress, the
great railroad trusts, represented by the so
called passenger associations, are now en
deavoring to accomplish by Injunction what
they have failed to secure by direct legisla
tion; and
Whereas, Because of the great World's Fair
at St. Louis and the necessity for" cheap rail
road fares to secure a large attendance, the
railroad trust, taking advantage of the situ
ation, declares that the usual reduced rates
for such - occasions will not be made unless
ticket brokerage be destroyed by city ordi
nances and injunctions, thus permitting them,
to profit enormously by the forfeiture of re
turn coupons in the bands of excursionist*
and others who may be unable to use them
personally and which they would make it

The following resolutions, recently
adopted by the American Federation of

Council indorse thÂ« proposed Issuance of said
bunds, fully realizing the enormous benefit that
will accrue therefrom to the city and State,
and also the amount of labor necessarily con

wage earner will receive, financially, the
greater part; and further, we request that all

Before he was allowed to epeak at
all he was compelled to wait five
minutes while his. audience gave vent
to tumultuous cheers- No sooner would
a wave of enthusiasm begin to fall
than some strong voice would rouse the
people to renewed efforts. It was spon
taneous and given with a will that left
no doubt aa to the place Cleveland
holds in the hearts of Democrats. As
there are seats for only twenty-five
hundred people In the hall not more
than three thousand were admitted.
Many times that number were turned
away. At the conclusion of the meet-
Ing Cleveland was fairly mobbed on

required to clear the passage for him.
NEW YORK. Oct. 21.â To Grover

tions and one of the most enthusiastic
receptions ever accorded to a public
men In New York. Returning to the
political platform In this city for the
first time in a dozen years, with tbe
exception of a brief address delivered
at a reception at the Tilden Club, early
last winter. Cleveland was taken to
the hearts of as audience which filled
every available foot of space in the
hall.
His address, which he read in a clear
voice that reached to the remotest
part* of the galleries, was punctured
more than a score of times by perlodÂ«
cf enthusiastic cheers. His arraign
ment of the Republican party for Its
alleged hypocrisy and trust-fostering
principles brought his audience to its
feet time after time, while his sar
castic reference to "Infant industries
v hich are able to sell their product in
foreign countries for less than they

HUMILIATIONS OF CAMPAIGN.
There are, however. In mr mind to-night
some aspects and incidents of this campaign
which srem to me ao startling and so humil
iating that they should arrest the attention
of every thoughtful citizen and arouse the
anxloua solicitude of every patriotic American.
In a country like ours, where parties contest
for the direction of the Government, we must
of course expect psrty advocacy and honor
able personal ambitions tor political honors;
but who among those indulging In the farthest
retrospect of political campaigns can retail one
in which the advantages of the. present party
control have been ao palpably and unblush
tngly uaed for its perpetuation or in which
the functions telonglr.gr to the entire American
people have been more insolently . forced to
do partisan service? When before has It been
so distinctly claimed that all the virtues, all
the. patriotism and all the governing ability
of our citizenship are found among the mem
ber* of one political party; and when before
have those of our citizens not among the
chosen been eo boldly considered as aliens
In their own land, who should be cast into
outer political darkness as unworthy to be
Intrusted with the power and responsibility
of a government established by the people and
for the people T When in all our history has
a party so presumptuously as now claimed- to
be the donors of the gifts of the gods or
wben has one so persistently plumed itself upon
the 'creation of all the prosperity that ' has
fallen to our country's lot? .
It would be strange if I did not recall at
this moment with deep senslbilty the days In
the past and the previous support of tbe busi
ness men cf New York, and If I did net re
member In these surroundings the sustaining
power of their approval and confidence amid
the perpjexlng labors of high official duty.
You will not, I know, accuse me of self-con
celt if I assume that I am with those to-night
who demand of me no explanation or apology
for the manner In which I have served either
my party or the business interests of my coun
try, and who will neither discredit nor dis
trust me when I avow my intÂ«mse anixety for
the suscess in the pending political campaign
for the principles and nominees of the reunited
Democracy.
There are at least two reasons why I am
gratified by the opportunity to participate in
thla occasion. It permits me to breathe the
pleasant atmosphere of resolute and hÂ«rmo
nious Democracy, and, in addition, It allows
me to meet face to face in euch an atmosphere

chief the enthusiastic outburst. Mrs.
Claveland and former Secretary of
War Daniel S. Lamont arrived while
the demonstration was at Its height
and were escorted to a box.
At the conclusion of his, speech
Cleveland introduced Carlisle, who de
livered an address, which he conclud
ed with a eulogy of Alton B. Parker.
Cleveland's speech in full was as
follows:
We asserted that, only seven years ago and
under a Democratic ' President the > total ex- '
penses of this Government were, less than
three . hundred Â¦ and -slxty-slx : mil
millions . of dollars - and . we charged
that In tbe last fiscal year the '-ex
penditures were over five hundred and eighty*
two million dollars. Those figures have not
been denUd and they cannot be. Deducting
from the latter amount the sum paid by this
Government for the Panama canal and I the
Panama canal rights, we still : have five hun
dred and thirty-two millions of dollar*. After
- The expenditures of the' Government, says
the administration, have been managed in a
spirit' of economy as far removed from' waste
as from niggardliness. That expenditures have
been free from niggardliness cannot. I think,
be successfully denied, hence It should be and
is frankly admitted.
' With the claim , that the expenditures have
been managed In a spirit of economy we must
take issue. The facts presented in support ot
the charge of extravagance have not been an
swered. Â¦Â¦Â¦â¢ , . '

to leave Jersey City at 10 o'clock and
arrive at Esopus at noon. At 10 o'clock
rain was falling In sheets at Jersey
City, and few . Democrats had arrived
at the trains. An hour, later a delega

Reaching Judge Parker's house the
delegation surrounded the veranda.
Though the rainfall had ceased,' the
trees were dripping and umbrellas had
to be raised. When .Judge Parker
stepped from the house he was greeted
by cheers and handclapplng. ' :
He spoke as follows: â¢;.'.
ESOPUS, N. Y., Oct. 21.â Judge
Parker to-day addressed a, delegation
from Hudson County, New Jersey, on
the subject of administration extrava
gance, answering a speech made by
Secretary of War Tart, in which the
Secretary called upon the Democrats
to give a bill of particulars In connec
tion with, their charge that economy in
Government affairs had been forgotten
in the years the Republicans have
been in control of national affairs.
Judge Parker quoted a few totals
from official reports, which, he assert
ed, not only raised the presumption of
extravagance, but proved' it. A bill of
particulars will* be given, he said,
when a Democratic administration gets
a chance at the books.
From midnight until after noon to
day rain fell in torrents. Streams
overflowed, the roads were converted
Into brooks and made nearly impassa
ble for pedestrians. â¢ Nevertheless, the
New Jersey delegations formed a pro
ceesion at the Esopus station of the
West Shore Railroad - and marched to
Rosemount.
But the President has not the power to de
clare a policy equivalent to a threat of armed
intervention whenever he shall decide the cir
cumstances Justify |t. An attempt to exercise
such a power would constitute a usurpation
prohibited by the Constitution of the United
States. Hence it . is safe to assume that not
withstanding the letter to Secretary Root,
which was read at : the Â¦ Cuban anniversary
dinner, no administration will dare to j at
tempt to "establish a. universal | protectorate
over American States :or to become responsi
ble for their misdeeds."
Mr. Olney admirably stated the purpose, of
the Monroe doctrine - In his address : at Har-
ARMED INTERVENTION.
. The inquiry is further made by the adminis
tration whether we would dare to reduce the
cost of the army. We answer i that most as
suredly, we would, and we ask the people to
decide between the administration and the
Democratic contention on that point. In the
year 1897 the War Department c6st less than
forty-nine millions of dollars, which was about
tho average cost per year for the- preceding
twenty-six years. This last year, a : year of
peace, the cost of the army was one hundred
and fifteen million dollars. One of the ques
tions we now ask the people is "what is the
use of spending more than double on the army
now than we deemed wise to spend previous
to the Spanish war?"
A large standing army was unnecessary then,
so our statesmen thought, and the result
proved. It Is alike | unnecessary now unless
militarism Is to become a part of our policy.
If we are to ' play the roll of the "big police
man 1 ' in the South 'American states, requiring
each to act according * to some administration
conception "ot decency in industrial . and po
litical matters,", and further require , It to
'.'keep order and. pay its obligations" according
to. the standard which may be set by each suc
ceeding, administration, 1 and if, In addition, 'the
administration may ' at * pleasure see to it Â¦ that
the, states "'govern - themselves': well and be
prosperous and orderly,"". according to the cri
terion-which may' be set by-' each administra
tion, then we should readily admit that we
should 'have an army coating' one hundred and
fifteen' millions of dollars a year. .
We should further frankly concede that ' the
chances are that an attempt to execute such a
policy will require a much larger army, than
we have now and much greater expenditure of
money than one hundred and fifteen millions of
dollars a year. But the people have not as
yet . approved the administration's policy In
dealing with the South American states. They
have not yet said by their votes that they are
In favor of conferring upon the President the
power to interfere with the internal affairs of
a South American state at pleasure; to investi
gate their form of government; to see whether
or not ha is satisfied with it, and in the event
that \ he is not to summarily decree auch pun
ishment as In his Judgment the circumstances
warrant. â¢Â¦ ./Â¦ Â¦ -..-"Â¦ < Â¦, :Â¦;.
, COST OF THE ARMY.
We answer, certainly not and we further
assert that the Inference suggested by the
question > Is not ingenious. The amount paid
out in pensions has been decreasing every year
since 1808. â¢ But for the unwarranted or
der No. Â¦ 78. which was fully considered In my
letter of acceptance, the amount - paid . for
pensions In the seventh preceding year would
have exceeded the: amount paid last year. As
it was, the Â¦ difference was only one and one
half millions of dollars. It Is therefore neces.
sary for the administration to look. in other
directions than the disbursements for pensions
for the justification in excess of expenditures
in last ' year over that of seven years - ago of
over. one hundred and sixty-six millions ot dol
lars.
making that deduction we find that It coat
about one hundred and sixty millions of dollars
more to run the Government last year than It
did | seven years j ago. The statement on its
face | raises the presumption i of extravagance
and waste, a presumption which requires evi
dence to overcome.
â¢â¢ None has been presented. By way of indi
rect answer to the . Democratic charge of ex
travagance the Inquiry has been' put by the
administration whetbet we propose to cut/ off
the pensions.
One of the official family of the administra
tion asks that we support our charge of ex
travagance by specifications. The figures given
above will fully answer that purpose. They
SPECIFICATIONS WANTED.
Now what has 'happened? So tremendously
have our expenditures under that head grown
during the last seven years that the. last fiscal
year they amounted to one hundred and eighty
six million dollars. More than double the ex
penditures ot. 1897. We deduct the extraor
dinary expenditure for the Panama canal and
rights amounting to fifty million dollars, and
w e still find the expenditures under that head
to be forty-six millions of dollars . greater than
they were seven years ago, an increase of
more than 50 per cent.
I have on another occasion referred .. to the
waste of money in the Philippines, putting the
cost to us at six hundred and fifty million
dollars. In addition to the twenty million dol
lars paid to Spain for the opportunity of taking
its place in wasting lives and money on the
Philippines, asserting - not a dollar of it will
ever come back to us. The answers so far '
have betrayed a desire to deatroy the effect
the statement should have. To that end an
issue Is attempted to be made as to the
amount expended. â¢
The defenders of this policy of waste say
that I put the figures too high. An examina
tion of the speeches of Senators and Repre
sentatives In Congress recently .made. Includ
ing that of Senator Hoa r in the Senate of the
United States, May 22. 1302. will show that my
statement of cost was an underestimate, as it
was Intended to be. ' HWltjr fiTtfVfWWM
Edward Atkinson, whose fame as a statis
tician Is secure In the confidence of his coun
trymen. In* a letter to the New. York Time* of?
October* 20. 1 1904," estimates the cost to us at
two - hundred . millions of dollars. . His " letter
should be read. by every voter. The vast sums
expended come out of the pockets of our tax
payers. Not a dollar of It will be returned to
them, and it Is for th*m to determine whether
they are willing to have their money ex
pended In .Mjpport of such a policy. If they
are. then otner Islands and other countries may
be added to our possessions .until their Â¦ cost
of maintenance compels every worker In this
country to support . a soldier and his family
as well as himself and his own.
GROWTH OF EXPENDITURES.
vard College March 2. 1888: . "The vital fea
ture of the Monroe doctrine is ; that no Eu
ropean power shall forcibly posssss itself of
American soil : and forcibly, control the ' poli
tical fortunes and destines of its people."
That ' is the ' national position and it will
be maintained. But how South American
states shall behave toward each other, or
whether they- shall govern themselves well or
be â¢ prosperous, is ; not part of the Monroe doc
trine. Until the people ahs.ll amend the Con
stitution | so as i to â¢ permit the Â¦ execution ot
the remarkable policy suggested by the let
ter of Secretary Root, it is perfectly safe to
say that we shall have no more, need for a
larger army than we formerly bad. I In the
conduct of the War Department alone there
can be saved to the people many millions a
year, which the administrator! not only dees
not propose to save, but is frank enough to
say it. Take another illustration which I re
cite as -furnishing strong presumptive evidence
of extravagance. Seven years ago under
Democratic administration the civil and mis
cellaneous expenses of the Government amount*
ed to ninety millions of dollars for the year.
During all the history â¢ of this country the
expenditures of this character ' had been grad
ually mounting up as the country Increased in
population, until finally it had reached the
sum of ninety millions.' -
A class of men has multiplied vastly of late,
so vastly that they may be found everywhere
throughout thÂ« length and breadth of the land,
trying to get Something for nothing that some
thing to come out of the public treasury, thus
creating a burden that Is felt more and more
every ' year by taxpayers, who can only rely
for protection upon the earnest watchfulness
and rugged honesty . of those charged - with
the duty of administration.
not only raise the presumption of extravagance,
but they prove it. A further bill of partlcu- .
lars will be furnished as toon as a Democratic
administration 'baa had a chance to examine
the book*. The result of this extraordinary in.
create In our expenditures has been to create
a deficiency -In the annual receipts. In other
words, it is costing' more money now to run the
Government than wa are taking In. In the
last ' fiscal year the revenues fell short over
forty millions of dollars. In the first sixty day*
of this fiscal year the expenditures exceeded I
the receipts by twenty-tour millions of doj- j
lars. How much more we - have run behind
since we are not. able to state owing to the
recent administrative orders forbidding Gov
ernment officers from making public any state*
ment of estimates on which future appro
priations are based. It Is safe to assume from
the making of the orders that there has been
no improvement, other-wise the public would
not be dealed all Information pending the cam
paign. ' '*
Now this . deficiency in - receipts presents a
serious situation. Either the expanses must be
cut down â and the present administration says
in effect that It does not propose to do it â
or we must provide some other method of
raising the needed money. Cither bonds must
be Issued for that purpose, or we must levy
Other taxed. Such taxes were raised under the
war revenue law of 1895, entitled "An act to
provide ways and means to meet war ex*
pen.il tn res and for other purposes," an in
convenient and Irritating method of providing
revenue which in its operation both annoyed
and burdened every class of people.
We do not charge that money is deliberately
thrown away or that It is turned over to all
who make some shadow of claim for it without
Question In;, but rather that the evidence points
unmistakably to lack of effort to hold In
check those wboae business it Is to provide
ways and means to profit by Government ex*
pen--. In Other words, economy in th* ex
penditure of the money Is no longer the object
of the administration. Saving of millions of
the people's money a year seems unattractive.
It require* not only bard work to discover the
leaks, but it requires moral courage as well aa
hard work to stop them. Every business man
knows that he must be on guard if he would
prevent the expenses of bis business from i
eating up both profits and principal. Â¦
GOVERNMENT EXPENDITURES.
Experience teaches every individual that real j
effort is required to keep expenses within limits.
The rule is the same as to the Government
expenditures, but It is not always heeded. In
deed, of late, it seems to have been seldom
fe-eded. The politician who said: "What is
the ' constitution between friends?" stated the j
view entertained by many, a view that Is :
growing among those who want something '
from the Government. It affects communities
as well as Individuals. It Is evidenced by
multitudinous - schemes to Â¦ secure . govern
mental expenditures In certain localities. Each
not only seeks what- it needs, but what it
calls Its share. . Illustrations abound on every
hand which show that the teachings ;of recent
years. -that it is a legitimate function of Gov- j
eminent to help Individuals, is having a dls- \
astrous effect upon political morals. It stlmu- ;
lates the Ingenuity of Individuals tn every lo- j
cality to devise .ways and means to secure his
part. It all tends to the creation and support ;
of the grafter. ,
G ROVER CLEVELAND, former President of the
United States, last night in New York made his . first
appearance in twelve years on a political platform, and
xvas accorded a most enthusiastic reception. In a lengthy and
deliberately delivered speech he poured cold water on the
claims of the administration and criticized what he called "the
arrogance of the party in power. He gave the Republicans
credit for safeguarding the soundness of the nation's cur
rency, but declared that no one party could claim to be the pro
tectors and defenders of America's financial integrity. At the
conclusion of the meeting Cleveland was fairly mobbed on the
platform by people desirous of shaking his hand, and the as
sistance of the police was necessarv to dear a way for his pas
sage from the hall.
ALTON B. PARKER, in a speech delivered yesterday at
Esopus before a' delegation ,from New Jersey, undertook
to rq)iy to Secretary of War Taf t, who, in a recent
speech, called upon the Democ rats for figures to prove Demo
cratic assertions of administration extravagance. The Demo
cratic nominee quoted figures which, he declared, proved the
absence of economy, but expressed inability to furnish the
"bill of particulars" requested by the former Governor of the
Philippines until a Democratic administration gets a chance at
the books. Heavy rain marred the cbmfort of the Judge's
visitors, but ten coach loads of New Jersey Democrats braved
the deluge, waded â¢ through the thick Â» mud that blanketed the
rural roads of Esopus, and, uuder dripping umbrellas, listened
to the words of their leader.
and a boy named George Helgesson
went to play In a cave in the side of
a gravel quarry at the intersection of
Clipper and Douglas streets. The bank
caved upon them; burying * Helgesson
to the knees. Weaver to the waist and
Foley altogether- . Helgesson pulled
himself out and helped out Baby Wea
ver." Then the two, with thÂ» toy.shov
els with which they had 'been playing,
tried to dig the sand'from Willie Foley
and save, his life.' Such was little Mel
vin's story.
The young witness, hardly old enough
to know the meaning of the . word
death, told what he knew with remark
able clearness. A child . that turns hero
as Melvin Weaver. did, 'rather than cry
and run to' its mother,' Is the type that
is not afraid of a Coroner's jury. When
little Melvin's prattling narrative end
ed the jury brought In a verdict of
death by accident.
.One of the most remarkable Inquests
ever helcTin San Francisco was that
over six-year-old "Willie Foley yester-
day. The unfortunate boy was killed
by the caving In of a gravel bank on
September 23.
'The star, witness before Coroner In
land was a bright little cherub who
was born in 1900. .A large number of
auditors heard the babe tell of the
tragedy. Too young and innocent to
dissemble, yet brave enough to facvj
an audience . and tell the truth, little
Melvin proved a wonderful witness.
White headed and chubby, the infant
hero toddled to the witness stand , as
If it were a baby chair. Then he lisped
the story of his comrade's death at
play, told how the child was .buried
under a, slide of gravel.

It is sometimes an easy matter to
fool the public, but you can't keep it
up very long. They are sure to find
.you out, and every time a man is
fooled another skeptic is made.
Skepticism is allowable when read-
ing in a home newspaper about some
incident occurring in Maine or Iowa,
but the circumstances are entirely
different when it refers to some one
right here at home, friends and
neighbors, people you know, whom
you can sec and with whom you can
talk it over. This is the kind of evi-
dence at the back of Doan's Kidney,
Pills â home statements by home
people? and the astonishing local
work they have been doing has caused
more talk amoqg . our citizens , than
the doings of any other modern
wonder. Read the following:
W. P. Canty, employed in a fruit
cannery, residence 318 Minna street,
says: "I have gont out of mv way
â¢to induce friends and acquaintances
whom I knew suffered from back-
ache or kidney complaint to use
Doan's Kidney, Pills. In fact, l.have
never lost an opportunity to indorse
them very forcibly. I have good
reasons for so doing. I knew that
my kidneys were either excited or
weakened. I knew I required some
medicine^ to soothen, purify and wash

.;- A- 1 telegram received last evening
from Reno, New, announced the
death there yesterday morning of
John Bayle, a wealthy San Francisco
shipper and -packer and formerly
president of thÂ» French Hospital in
this city.
Mr. Bayle, who was a native of
France, came to San Francisco about
forty years ago, when he was 23
years old. He engaged in the butch
ering business, succeeded greatly and
at the time of his death was president
of Bayle. La Coste & Co., butchers
and meat packers, and of the Callfor
! nia Fertilizing Works. His firm con
trolled a number of large city mar
kets. He leaves a fortune said to
amount to nearly $1,000,000. His res- !
idence was at 1332 Fifth avenue
south. Three daughters survive him,
Mrs. Charles Artigues, Mrs. L. La
caze and Miss Catherine Bayle; also"
a sister, Mrs. Jacques B. Areilles. All
these live' in San Francisco. â¢
Mr. Bayle has always been active in
Republican politics and has taken a
great interest in municipal affairs. He j
was Â¦ also a . member of California i
Commandery No. 1, Knights Templar,
and of the Druids, Odd Fellows and
several j French societies. .
The cause of his death was asthma,
from, which he . .was . a sufferer for
many years. He had gone to Reno
on October 4 in the hope that the
mountain air might give him relief.
Relatives left the city last evening
for Reno, where they will take charge
of the remains,, which will be brought
home for interment.

PIONEER AND CAPITALIST OF
THIS CITY WHO DROPPED
DEAD ON THE STREET.
George H. Hallctt, a pioneer of Cali
fornia and widely known In this city,
â¢where he had resided since the early
days, died suddenly yesterday. While
standing on Pine street talking with a
friend, shortly after 1 o'clock yesterday
afternoon, he suddenly pitched forward
and fell unconscious on the sidewalk.
Chief Surgeon John I. Stephen of the
Emergency Hospital, who happened to
be passing, rushed to the unfortunate
man's assistance, but a hurried exam
ination satisfied the surgeon that Hal
lett was dead. An ambulance removed
the body to the Ilorgue and from there
it was taken to an undertaking estab
lishment. His death is attributed to
heart disease. "..Â».'
Hallett left the Palace Hotel, where
he and his wife had resided ever since
the hotel was opened twenty-five years
ago, early yesterday forenoon, seem
ingly in the best of health. He was a
man of apparently robust physique and
a sudden call from death was the far
thest thought in his own mind yester
day when he sauntered down to Pine
Etreet. He was a native of Boston, 70
year- of age. "and came to San Fran
cisco in 1S13. For many years he took
an active part In the politics of the
city. He belonged to the volunteer fire
department. With the late Pliny Bart
letfc and several other associates Hal
lett founded the Contra Costa laundry,
of which he was the head for a number
of year?. He retired from active busi
ness lif* several years ago and spent
the greater part of his time about the
Palace Hotel. He is survived by a
â¢aidow, a son and a brother, W. L. Hal
lett of this city. '
William H. Hallett, the son, is now
tinging -with Dockstader's minstrels in
It is not definitely' known whether
Jensen has succeeded in interesting, any
of the creamery people in his scheme,
but it is known. that he is operating
his new creamery to full. capacity, and
he already controls 15 per cent of the
output in the Ferndale district.
Leading butter men, when interview
ed yesterday, said that while these re
ports were true, there was no Im
mediate cause for alarm. It was not
considered possible to control the out
put of butter in Humboldt County,
where competition has always been
keen, and any attempt in that direction
could be frustrated by a concerted
move on the part of local dealers. ' It
was also said that the firm . which
Jensen represents was engaged in the
manufacture of creamery machinery
and that his main object in operating
a creamery was to demonstrate Â¦. the
superiority of the machinery turned out
by that firm.
It is certain, however, that the move
ment is on foot and if the promoters
succeed in forming a combine the local
Interests will suffer. . '.
Efforts are being made to merge the
leading creameries of Humboldt County
into a combine with the object of con
trolling the butter industry of . the
county and the proceedings are being
watched with . much interest by local
butter men, who are handling the pro
duct of the creameries in that section.
The venture is said to have the back-
Ing of the Continental Creamery Com
pany of Topeka, Kansas, one of the
largest concerns of its kind in the
United States.
-A. Jensen, who has recently, estab
lished a creamery In the Ferndale sec
tion â¢ of the county, is said to be the
representative of , the Topeka, firm and
it is known that he has already caused
somewhat of a flurry among the butter
makers by offering to pay the farmers
of the district higher prices for. butter
fat than the long established concerns
were pa^Jng. Mr. Jensen was. in. San
Francisco some time ago and while
here he made no secret of his plans.
His intention was to centralize the
business by establishing a central depot
for the delivery of milk and to operate
creameries only within a certain dis
trict. ...

The mining interests of the State of Cali
fornia arc so diversified, and . the industry Is
extended over so .wide an area, that it is diffi
cult to describe the conditions which exist with-'
out using many pages of printed matter. .
-For this reason it has been considered proper,
in. this pamphlet, to give merely a record of
results, which will show in plain figures what
is being accomplished by the , miners - of the
State. This record shows that some forty-four
mineral substances are being exploited.' the an
nual valuation of which is now 537,759,040 and
lnci easing at the rate of about 12.500.000
yearly, as capital Is invested and more mines
are opened. The older mines, too. having been
well â¢ developed and equipped, .are Increasing
their annual output, and thus also proving
their permanency and' value with depth.
Â¦ The climatic conditions . are favorable, to
mining operations throughout the State, and
means of transportation have been 'â¢ so â¢ Im
proved as to grectly lessen costs of supplies,
etc. There are abundant opportunities for the
sf.fÂ«* and profitable Investment of capital in the
various branches of the Industry, as numerous
claims -which have been 'located Â¦ have never
been properly/developed . . or equipped, ' their
owners lacking the necessary means. â¢â¢Â¦Â¦'Â» .
: The attentive reader by referring to
the bulletin, which is numbered 35,
will find the amount and value of each
mineral produced by any county, un
der the several county, headings. The
statistics of California mineral produc
tion in 1903 have already, been fully
reviewed in The Call. The : following
supplementary general statements,
taken from the bulletin, are calculat
ed to attract the attention of outsid
ers to the mines of California:

fornia are wisely, seizing opportunities
to advertise their mineral resources to
the world at large. ;: Nevada County
loses few chances in- this direc-on. At
tention is called this morning to some
general ' statements that are made on
authority ' relating to Plumas and Sis
klyou counties. It wilLbe seen by the
Annual returns of the State Mineralog T
i?t for 1903 that the mineral output of
Â¦Plumas County in 1903 amounted to
$424^85(4, this including gold,- /copper,
silver and manganese. , Siskiyou Coun
ty produced in 1903,' in gold," silver, and

; The â¢ State Mineralogist does *
many counties, in compact form/ what
is needed by them by sending out a
new bulletin in ' which, their mineral
resources are epitomized. One para

OKGAXIZE A DISTRICT.
From the Salmon Mountains to the coast, a
distance of, nearly one hundred miles, lies one
of the best prospecting â¢ countries In the world,

People by the ., thousands .ru*a.lo> Alaska and
other places, risk lives and money, 'and
thtn find out that ihe'same amount of energy
and money" spent in Blskiyou \ County would
have brought them better returns. We have
many low grade propositions throughout the
Salmon â¢ that will pay . big : returns if proper
machinery . was put In,' also - many prospects
yet undeveloped which only need depth to
become paying . properties, and many carry
free gold on the surface. .This runs Â¦ to sul
phates at or near water level, that will pay
if the 'sulphates could be handled. Tons upon
tons of these sulphates are run off 1 In the tail
ings on account of not having smelters to work
them. It is a rough country, parts having
not even; a, good trail. Alaska has this same
drawback. . It is dif Hculu to get provisions in
some parts. Our main trouble Is that our
mines have never been boomed. Capital is
drawn Into mines by booming mining camps
and creating excitement. This we have never
done. 'Our county has been onÂ« of the leading
gold producers in the country, yet it has never
been boonrsd like other counties. This county
has been slowly . but steadily coming to the
front on ' Its merits as a gold , producer, al
though the news of -many of our rich strikes
have never reached the outside world. Tha
field Is here and the gold Is here, and alt
we. .want Is capital to develop our hidden
treasure.
The Scott Valley Advance says:
Mining ' interests in; Plumas County
receive. attention in a county publica
tion that; has just been issued. The
county: has air the needed accessories
to mining, water in abundance, and an
ample supply of timber. Gold mining
has been. a leading factor in the prop
erty of Plumas since the days of the
pioneers. First came the exploitation
of the placers as a matter of course.
It is officially estimated that the Span
ish ranch and La Porte districts, both
of which continue to yield treasure,
have produced . in gold not less than
$50,000,000 in total. Within the past
two years river placer mining has been
greatly - stimulated. By going deeper
the -coarser gold that was not found
by the pioneer miners has been saved.
Twelve miles of riverbed below Sal
mon Falls will soon be laid bare by
the operations of a power company.
"While most of the shallow deposits
caused by breaks from ancient river
channels have been mined," says the
county /publication, \ "many deeper
gcld-bearlng gravel beds or parts of
ancient channels are . available for
sluice or by hydraulic mining, notably
In the Meadow Valley basin."
It is predicted that activity in drift
mining will largely , increase the out
put of gold in Plumas County. Only
the quartz mines of high-grade ores in
the county have received full atten
tion. There are two quartz belts that
run -through the county. Copper is
known to exist largely in Plumas.
Claims- have not been worked to any
extent simply because of the lack of
transportation and the means of re
duction. When the county has rail
ways enough for its use the mining
industry will become much more
prominent.

WHAT OVERWORK REALLY MEANS.
What a Ions story is coadense'd In that one -word,
which Mrs. Frye uses in her letterâ as Hoover*
work" were a matter of course. '
How many persons ever stop to realize that "oveÂ»
work" simply means that their vitality has not been
sufficient for the duties, of the dayâ the work has
probably been no more than a normally healthy per*
'son could do with ease.
Instead of calling it "over-work" it would be truer
to speak of it asâ "Under-vitality." .
Remember, your strength is not in your musclesâ
the muscles simply work when the nerve force tells
thejn to. Even your brain does not work by itselfâ
the substance in your brain cells depends on getting
energy with which to do its work; and this energy
is nerve force â the same great power-of-llfe that
actuates every function of the body.
Every form of weakness, or sicknessf or disease,
results from a lack of the strong nerve foice which
should keep the organs working properly.
When one speaks of "a good constitution," one
simply means a sound, strong nerve system.
When the nerve system is not strong and well-
nourished, it follows inevitably that, one is easily
"over- worked" â easily run down-^-Just as Mrs. Fryo
describes:
"As a tonic and Invlgorater I am sure
nothing equals Rhine's - Cerely Compound.
Â¦ I have it always on hand.
"When weak and* nervous, or restless from
overwork, a dose of it soothes and strength*
ens me so that I wake up bright and re-
freshed, and fully capable of going through
a strenuous . day's work." â Mrs. Anna B.
. Frye, 122 OeKalb Ave., Brooklyn, N. Y, Au-
gust 5, 1904.
The nerves need food to keep op' their strength
Their food is not the same food that we usually
know. * fffiSs
Prof. Phelps, of Dartmouth University," was the-
first physician to enunciate the principle which to-
day is recognized as one of the foundations of the
science of medicine,â the great enlightening truth,
that the nerve system rules all the body's health.
X He sought 'and found , the food that builds up and .
restores: the nervesâ his" celery formula, which has
become famous as Paine's . Celery Compoundâ the
celebrated nerve vltalizer and tonic.
Doctors know and value this prescription and make
constants use of it in their practice.
â¢ Its effect is almost ins tantaneou3â the nourishment
and vigor givento the nerve system' by Paine's Celery
Compound is felt at once. -
The patient feels this at once and gains confidence
by it
. The stronger, nerve forces have begun at once to
make each organ of the bldy'do the work that ma*
ture_ expects of it.
Two days* treatment with Paine's Celery compound
will prove Its marvelous power.
Remember this,â Paine's Celery Compound is tht
prescription of one of tbe most famous physicians this
country has ever known, and all reputable druggists
sell and recommend it.

The reason stated for selling the
church properties is that a large num
ber of the members of the church are
going to remove with their families to
Mountain View, and that when they,
are gone the present building will be
too large and expensive to maintain.
The presses of the paper are already
set up at Mountain View, and the paper
Is now being printed there. The plant
is a complete one, and - does a large
business. â¢ Several hundred people are
employed by it. All these are remov
ing to the . new field, and in a short
time it is expected that the entire estab
lishment, including the employes, will
have been successfully transplanted.

Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1016 Broadway, Oct. 21.
Railroad movements of the greatest
importance are taking place in the
Fruitvale district Just south of the
Oakland city ilne. Where this section
is now possessed of one main railroad
line and one electric line there are in
dications of two additional overland
Eteam railroad lines, one other electric
line and the improvement of the elec
tric line that now traverses this sec
tion.
The Southern Pacific Company now
has two railroad lines to San Jose, and
the Oakland Traction Company con
trols the electric system. The indi
cations for ttre future are that the
Western Pacific Company will begin
work within a few months upon its
main line, that the Santa Fe system is
preparing to build into San Jose, that
the Key Route Is anxious to extend a
feeder for its ferry into this section,
that the Haywards electric eystem is to
be turned into a broad gauge line, and
that the Southern Pacific Company is
eoing to begin the extension of its lines
Into San Francisco via Dumbarton
Point at once. "-'"T f
The Western Pacific is the most ac
tive factor in this section, and when
this line begins, its construction all of
the other deals outlined will have to be
consummated in order that the other
systems may protect themselves. The
Western Pacific Company holds a valu
able franchise through Oakland, along
Third street, and out through East
Twelfth street to the city line at Fruit
vale. This company has done enough
preliminary work to hold its franchise,
but It has to complete ita work
through Oakland within a few months
mere or lose its privllages.
From the Oakland city line at Fruit-
Tale to Haywards Is a short distance,
and the Western Padflc Company has
several surveys and a right of way
already secured. In order to hold
these, construction work will soon have
to be commenced. The statement is
znade In Oakland that work will be be
gun upon the Oakland terminus at the
came time with the construction
through the Marysville diitrict, which
is to be commenced In a few weeks.'
The beginning of work by the West
Â«rn Pacific Company will force the
Eanta Fa to build from its present
Emeryville terminus Into San Jose.
The Santa Fe has already made ar
rangements' with the Realty Syndicate
for a right of way half way to San
Jose, and the other half can be se
cured at little cost.
SATS BRIDEGROOM CAN
ATTEND IN SPIRIT O3TLT
The Southern Pacific Company is pre
paring to meat this competition by
building from Niles to "Centerville, to
Newark, and as soon as the War De
partment grants the right for a bridge
across San Francisco Bay at Dumbar
ton Point it will complete the rail
road along that line and carry Liver
more Valley freight into San Francisco
direct.
The Key Route has also a right of
way from Piedmont into the East
Oakland and Fruitvale district that will
some day be completed.
Agents of the new Oakland and
Marysville Railroad, which is simply
H. E. Huntington under a corporate
name, have been Investigating rights
of way. The road will run through the
Fruitvale hills.
The Oakland Traction Company,
which owns the Haywards electric line,
has already completed its plans for the
changing of the present narrow gauge
system into a broad gauge line. The
material and even the cars are on hand,
and it is only a Question of a few
weeks before work will be begun upon
this improvement. Ultimately the
Haywards cars will be run from Hay
wards down Twelfth street in Oakland

California may well be proud of her
goats. ' C P. Bailey of San Jose swept
everything before him here In that
line at the live stock show. He was
awarded the grand champion prize Tor
a buck, sweepstake prize - for finest
Cock bred by an -exhibitor, a gold
medaifor winning 'the most prizes of
any breed, and another for winning
the' most prizes 'of any exhibitor.
took twenty-five prizes in all.
The ' sweeping.victory of the Bailey
goats has revived, the story of how Dr.
Bailey, son of the owner of the flock,
secured two of the original bucks from
Turkey, : despite Â¦ the : mandate of the
Sultan' that none of the thoroughbred
angoras in his dominion should pass
its borders. Dr. Bailey fooled the Sul
tan", and his grand vizier- and sailed
proudly home w\th two pedigreed ani
mals he had smuggled out. of the em
pire. He got them to a seaport after
letting them browse around some coal
bunkers until -their coats looked like
anything .but those of prize winners
and then them aboard ship' by mix
ing them with a bunch of , other ani
mals. It is said that If he goes back
to Turkey he will be beheaded, unless
he tells, the ;. Sultan how Jie got the
goats Â¦ aboard ship, so the men who
were guilty of . negligence can bow
their necks to" the scimitar, or go down
to the.Bosphorus In bags. â¢â
The gold medal awarded to the
University of California for the seed
and cereal display made by it saves
the reputation of the State as a grain
producing section to a certain extent.
The university made this display In
the Alameda County section. - It Is not
to grains that /California must look
for her future development, but abil
ity to produce them appeals to the
practical farmer of the East and
draws the attention of â¢ many where
fruit, wine and olives .would not, so
California should always strive for
cereal, prizes as well. as others. .,:',*-.
.The California exhibitors here ex
press no particular concern that olives
from their State were awarded noth
ing better than sliver medals. The for
eigners on the Jury are. not prepos
sessed in favor of ripe olives, but tha
taste of the public Is ' unerring and
the ; ripe, product is sure to take Its
place. Few green California olives
were shown, the demand for the ripe
ones Being so much greater. In fact
the demand for the ripe olive seems
to be greater than the supply. It Is
admitted, too, that many of the ripe
olives sent from California were some
what ;*soft" and not up to "Bhow"
Standard, though all right to the ordi
nary palate.
Different Juries, too, make different
awards,* Some oils and other prod
ucts ' that have taken gold - medals . at
other expositions were awarded silver
ones here, and vice versa.

position in the matter of awards has

cases of injustice, mainly due to over
sight, that are the subject of appeal.
One of the most vigorous protests
made Is by the Sacramento Valley De

J. H. . Wills, Its commissioner, here.
This Is upon the processed vegetables
award.. "Processed," as many may
not know, means put up in solution In

the largest exhibit of this kind shown
here and It was awarded a gold med
al. Such medals are deemed excellent
prizes, but the ; Sacramento Valley,
while Jubilant over the general awards
made to it, does not think -It should
have had less than a grand prize for
Its vegetable display. Some grand
specimens are shown and they are all
as near perfect as vegetables can be.
There is nothing lacking in size and
variety, either. One cauliflower lri

Additional charges brought out to

by ' Dr. Charles ' C. Lancaster allege
that - Mercedes H.^' Lancaster g is -' . a

A pension of |24 a month was taken
away from George Monitor Â¦ to-day by
Judge Ogden and awarded to Minnie
Mollitor, who ' is suing him for a di
vorce. They have three children, and
she alleges that he la drinking to such
an extent that his family is afraid
longer to live with " him. He has
threatened their lives on many occa
sions and in other ways made their ex
istence miserable. * Pending the hear
ing* of the action the pension was given
to the wife and children.
Because his wife already had a hus
band when he married her, James E.
Stevens has brought an action to an
nul his marriage to EUanora Capps,
alias Ellanora Stevens. He saya that
he married- her under a misapprehen
sion of hl3 rights. He knew that she
had been married before, but she told
him there was an irregularity in the
proceedings, and Stevens says that he
consulted a lawyer, who declared that
their marriage would be legal. He is
now convinced her marriage to her for
mer husband was valid. Difficulties
have arisen, and - he wants to escape
from bonds that have become irk
nomi.
Not impressed with the tale of her
Enoch Arden husband, Mrs. James C.
Fink has begun a suit for divorce
against him. Fink has return â¢Â« lately
from "Australia, where he roamed for
many years. He failed to write or
send her any money, but lately turned
up and wished to resume his position
In the bosom of his family. Love,
however, had \ cooled in his absence,
and his son and daughter had gone out
into the world to earn their own liv
ing, and the face at the window
brought no quickening to the wife's
pulse.
Fink says that he went to Australia
to seek- a fortune, but that luck was
against him' and his efforts resulted in
failure. In her complaint Mrs. Fink
declares tha^ he deserted her and that
he neither wrote nor sent her . money.
She mourned him as dead and would
not now revive the image she had laid
away.
Through pity for her husband, who,
she learns, is the victim of tubercu
losis, Julia Sedgeley to-day dismissed
her action' for divorce against Abner
F. Sedgeley. He is a brakeman In

learned of his danger she asked her at

Despondent from 111 health and pov
erty and failing to borrow money on
his pistol, V. R. Stowe of Missouri, as
he registered, committed suicide this
afternoon in a room at the Hotel Mer
ritt. Twelfth and Franklin Btreet*. He
shot himself in the head while stand
ing in front of a mirror. The shot
was heard by Henry Kurz, proprietor
of the hotel, who called the police.
Detective Shorey climbed through a
transom and found Stowe's body, the
pistol at his side.
Stowe engaged the room several
days ago, saying he was from.Andrain
County, Mo. He was quiet and seem
ed in good spirits until this morning,
when he asked Mrs. Kurz, her hus
band being absent, to lend him $20
on his pistol. Stowe said he was very
ill and must have money with which
to purchase medicine. Mrs. Kurz
said she could not lend the money
without conference with her husband.
Stowe then went to his room and
soon afterward the fatal shot was
heard. Stowe was about 22 years old.
Coroner Mehrmann took charge of
the body.
R. A. Hag-an. S65H Market street, San
Francisco, identified the body to-night
as that of Victor R. Stowe, whom he
had nursed while Stowe was in care of
Dr. Morris of Third street, San Fran
cisco, suffering from heart disease.
Stowe had been receiving remittances
from Martlnsburg, Mo., until lately.
When they ceased the young man
pawned his diamonds and became more
and more despondent.
Stowe tried to drown himself yester
day Jjy jumping into the bay off Broad
way wharf, San Francisco. He was
fished out and revived ' at the Harbor
Hospital. Thence he returned to Oak
land. Hagan said Stowe had- been in
the lumber business in Missouri.

1016 Broadway, Oct. 21.
Taunted by neighbors, distressed
over her poverty and chagrined be
cause she frit ehe had wrongly whip
ped one of her children, lire. Mary
Francis, 47 years old, threw herself In
front of an Alameda local train last
night at First and Harrison streets in
an attempt to commit suicide. The lo
comotive pilot hurled the woman Into
the street and prevented her from be
ing killed. She was taken .... to her
home, 151 Second street, where Dr.
J. F. LdUey attended her. Mrs.
Francis was cut about the head
and suffered internally, but the physi
cian cays fcis patient will recover.
With eight children living, the eldest
20 years of age and the youngest only
5, her husband a cripple, the rent due
and no money in Eight, the woman
gave way to her despondency and de
cided to end her earthly troubles. She
had worried herself sick because
neighbors had said, so she had heard,
that the family was unfit to receive
county help. That depressed the
mother so much that last night the
culmination of her woes came when
she learned that after shÂ« had punish
ed one of the little ones the child was
innocent of the offense of which a
neighbor had complained.
"That so discouraged me," said the
woman to-day, "that I felt as if I
could live no longer. I dressed myself
and went out to end it all."
Mrs. Francis' husband is a long
shoreman. Five of her offspring arÂ«
dead.

William Fox and Thomas Foyer,
young fellows, stole a box of tobacco
from â¢ a wholesale house and j had the
plunder concealed in a sack when Pa
trolmen McCowan and Conlan over
hauled them on lower Sacramento
street. They got six months apiece
from Judge Cabanlss.
Elvira Croce, who was shot by Paul
Sassel one night about three weeks
ago on Montgomery avenue, has com
pletely recovered from the effects of
her wound and refuses to file a com
plaint against her assailant. Sassel
has also survived the bullet hole in
his head which he made immediately
after shooting the girl because she
declined to marry him. Patrolman J.
P. Herlihy has been instructed \ by
Judge Mogan to Sassel with
attempt to commit murder.
Fire Marshal Towe told Judge Canba
niss that in his opinion, formed after
exhaustive investigation, Mrs.. Julia
Duffy did not feloniously start the fire
that threatened to burn â¢ down the
house in which she dwelt with her son
and his wife at 29 . Guy place. The
blaze was discovered by neighbors one
evening while Mrs. Duffy was alone in
the house, .the /other inmates Jiaving
gone to a theater. â¢. .While flames were
fiercely crackling in one apartment the
old lady was complacently seated in an
adjoining room, and when the danger
was averted her arrest was effected.
The Fire Marshal, however, failed to
find evidence of arson. The defendant's
son carried a $2500 Insurance ' policy
on the' house and furniture. Judge
Cabanlss dismissed the charge of arson
against the woman.
Political ardor elevating the spirits of
the male parent and neighborly sym
pathy depressing the soul of the moth
er were the causes of Mr. . and -Mrs.
Thomas Dolan's five minor children be
ing shamefully neglected. Undue in
dulgence in strong waters by both pa
rents, was also contributory to the piti
ful , plight in which Patrolmen Bruce
and Connolly found the little ones last
Thursday at the Dolan resi
dence, on Perry street, near Fourth.
The police were summoned by* resi
dents^ of the neighborhood, and when
they entered the house they found Do
lan, hilariously intoxicated,, the sole
custodian of a [ five-month-old infant
that was lustily crying for maternal at
tention. The older little ones were
complaining of hunger j and their ap
pearance verified all that the neighbors
had said concerning the unnatural con
duct of the parents. Dolan said that
he had been "electioneering" all day
and returned home to find his wife ab
sent and the children crying. Asked
where the woman was, he endeavored
to construct a coherent falsehood,' but
his sodden brain was unequal to ' the
task. Then one of the children said the
mother had departed early in the
morning to assist in the obsequies of
an acquaintance and had" neither come
back nor sent notification of when she
would come back or where she could
be found. Dolan and the children were
taken to the City Prison, where the
man was charged ', with -cruelty to a
minor child and his offspring were
placed In custody of the matron. Up
to noon yesterday the mother had not
returned to her home, nor had the po
lice been able to . find her. Â¦ Judge Mo
gan* continued the case against the
father till next Monday, by- which time
his consort will probably be sharing his
captivity.
Dolan was a minor politician of some
note during the, last two municipal
campaigns. He was appointed a jani
tor at the Hall of Justice, but neglected
his duties and was dismissed. The po
lice say' that if he would let politics
alone and devote his time to more
profitable tasks his wife might be a
better mother. While he pursues some
Ignis fatuus of politics her toil sup
ports the household, and her lapses
from maternal duty are the protests of
an overburdened soul.
While the policemen were telling
their story* in" Judge Mogan's court the
defendant -laughed hysterically and
otherwise acted so Irrationally as to
create doubt of his sanity. He was
sent to the Lunacy Commissioners for
examination.
John Ryan, who manufactures and
mends human footgear in the basement
of 1080 Howard street, made such , a
"rough < house" of his workshop last
Thursday evening that Mrs. Trltoch,
residing overhead, summoned Patrol
men Kruger and Brown to quell the
racket.. When the officers entered the
cellar they found Mr. Ryan dancing
like a dervish, howling like a coyote on
short rations and bombarding the walls
and telling with old shoes and lasts
and boot-trees and other missiles. They
experienced some trouble in subduing
him.
James J. Davis, accused of malicious
mischief, testified that when he entered
a Howard street saloon and ordered a
drink of whisky the bartender, Gerald
Donovan, invited him to drink with
some ladles.. Not being a ladies' man.
Mr. Davis declined the invitation and
laid a quarter of a dollar upon the
counter to pay for his sc-litary drink.
Mr. Donovan picked up the coin,
chucked.it into the till and refused to
give Mr. Davis the fifteen cents change
to which he was entitled. That started
the argument that terminated in Mr.
Davis smashing things and being ar
rested. He will be sentenced to-day.

Hazel Damon, a young domestic from
Berkeley, who fiercely fought Patrol
man Orr when he arrested her last
Saturday evening for drunkenness and
disturbing the peace on O'Farrell
street, was pronounced guilty of both
offenses and will be sentenced to-day.
Her demeanor in court was sullenly de
fiant and the only defense she offered
was the testimony of Al Morris, night
clerk at the Hotel Franklin, who said
he had known her about five weeks and
did not regard her as a disorderly char
acter.
â¢ â¢ â¢
Mrs. Margaret Werner, widowed
mother, of two pretty little girls, was
cleared of the charge of selling liquor
without a license in her grocery at 61
Tehama street. She declared that the
policeman who arrested her was in
plain clothes when he entered her store
and plteously begged for a drink of
whisky to quella stomachic cramp that
had, suddenly seized him, that she
handed him a small vial of the desired
liquor and that he then laid a dime
upon the counter, which she declined
to accept: If the same trick were again
attempted, she averred, it would prob
ably be successful, as she could not re
fuse to relieve apparent human suffer
ing.

Charles Matthews, a white-haired
youth, -â¢ had five live chickens in his
possession when Patrolman Stein over
hauled him early yesterday morning on
Twenty-fourth street and as he could
not give satisfactory explanation of
how the poultry and he happened to be
together, he- was arrested. He told
Judge Mogan ; that the Â¦ birds belonged
to his father, a rancher on the Mission
road, "and ,that he brought them to
town to sell them. Case continued for
investigation.

The Servia brought down from Kar
luk 48,600 cases of salmon and the Star
of Italy, which arrived from Pyramid
Harbor Thursday, had on board a

The Japanese employed In the fish
eries became enraged at their boss. K.
Amoto, and with that true Japanese
ferocity which is now being exhibited

ceeded to butcher their countryman.

It was a savage as well as cowardly
act. Twenty knife stabs were found in
the dead man's body. The murderers
were arrested and taken to Valdez for
â¢raminaxlon. The Japanese quarreled
over the wages due the men.
Hie bark Servla, which arrived

THE Sunday Call magazine to-morrow presents an unusually
strong fiction section, in addition to a number of special articles
of more than ordinary interest. "The Grafters," Francis Lynde's
powerful novel of politics, runs through its installment and
begins to gather in the threads for the , climax. The story, which
has proven one of the most popular that have lately appeared in the
Sunday Call, will be completed upon October 30. Following this
novel will appear, complete in one installment, "The Second Mrs.
Jim," by Stephen Conrad, one of the season's popular books. The
presenting of a popular novel in one installment, 7 at a price which
would not pay for a fraction of the paper used, is an extraordinary
and hitherto unprecedented departure in Sunday magazine fields.
"A Fill of Adventure," by Albert iSonnichsen, is a lively and
spirited narrative by a writer who has of late years taken front rank
as a writer of sea stories. Edward W. Townsend continues the
adventures of his country hero, who "receives a great light from a
dark place and proposes marriage," and in general displays a whole
some, if dearly bought, change of viewpoint upon life.
A new serial, "On and Off the Bread Wagon," being a chronicle
of the adventures of an amateur "Hobo," makes its first appearance.
This ingenious and amusing recital of tramp life is from the pen of
Charles Dryden, formerly a San Francisco newspaper man and em
ploye of The Call, a writer who 'is fast becoming noted for his facile
pen. There are an unusually large number of. storiettes by writers
whose names have become familiar to readers of the Sunday Call:
Channing Pollock, Epes Winthrop, Barry Preston, Kate M. Cleary,
Richard B.'Shelton and Martha McCulloch Williams. Kate Thyson
Marr has a caustic and satirical installment of reflections on mar
ried life in "How to Be Miserable Though Married."
In the women's section there are several bright articles. Mae
Slessinger contributes a story on "The Art" of Miniature Painting";
Augusta Prescott,, "New Gowns for Autumn" ; Madge Moore, "At
What Age Should Girls Marry," and there is a page story on the
proper method of taking! care of the hair.
A preliminary announcement is made calling : attention to a
local fiction contest soon to be inaugurated by the Sunday Call, in
which a cash prize of $50 will be given each week for the best local
fiction. Full details will be published on October 30.

being; if there be even huge gifts In
man or a woman, there are certain to
be likewise equally great defects.
"â¢ ' The man, I say,' Is \ conscious of cer
tain defects in his- makeup: and he
seeks â In . a:.woman Ithe Â¦: qualities !"Â¦ In
which he is lacking. The timid .man
loves the woman , of high . spirit; .the
clinging and feminine woman adores
the strong, self-willed, . arrogant . man
who knows his own mind and insists
on the . satisfaction of his own ambi
tions and desires.
Very often you see a very dull man
adore a woman simply, because he
recognizes in her .the intelligence
which he feels he lacks in. himself; and
very often you see a dull woman adore

Persian effects are also popular, as
are the striped ones used so much for
sash purposes. Louislne ribbon and
satin are among the pretty, ones of the
season and the plaids do not remain
far behind in popularity. Ribbon man
ufacturers are not exactly satisfied this
season, as the millinery line does not
bring into .use any of the new ribbons.
The hats are not trimmed as simply as
formerly ] and very few have even the
smallest part of ribbon or silk for dec
oration. A noticeable fact Is that the
double-faced satin ribbons are not in
the least degree popular and this is
perhaps caused by their stiffness.
Among the daintiest . accessories of
my lady's wardrobe this fall will be
the extremely, pretty and attractive
ribbons. All colors and â¢ hues are on
sale and some of the Dresden effects
are very new. The width* varies con
siderably, but as the wide belts are in
vogue the ribbon very often measures
ten or twelve inches in width. A new
idea is to put perfectly plain ribbon
and applique flowers on it. One is
shown of white satin ribbon ten inches
wide and down the center green velvet
leaves are placed with. a fancy stitch.
This is a great saving also, and women
who" are handy at this sort of thing
are able to have beautiful belts and
collars at a small. cost.
Everybody is familiar with the fact
that tall men are nearly always drawn
toward small women, and similarly
that if a woman be next door to a
dwarf, the object of her admiration is
always something approaching to a

DAINTY RIBBONS
OF THE SEASON
In Kahn and Hayes we have the chance to secure two good and
practical Representatives, who know the uses and the limitations
of legislation, and do not expect to reconstruct the world by an act
of Congress. We appeal, in a rton-partisan spirit, to the Demo
crats of this city to join their fellow citizens in securing our share
of the benefits which our position deserves, and it is in the power of
Congress to give, by electing men who represent the whole commu
nity and in whose hands the interests of labor and trade will be
equally safe. As far as Democrats are concerned they owe no al
legiance to either Livernash or Wynn, and are therefore free to
discharge their public duty at the polls, free from any partisan obli
gation. .
As for his colleague, Mr. Wynn, there is no evidence that he
even dreams. He docs not seem to know his own horizon, and is so
clazed by the practical part of legislation and by the hard work re
quired of a Congressman who does his duty by a city like this that
he is incapable of doing anything. We harbor no personal ill feeling
nor partisan prejudice against either of these gentlemen. They are
simply as much out of place in Congress as a cow at the piano. ' The
cow might do well in the dairy, but is out of her sphere at the key
board.
To re-elect them would be farcical. It would be trifling with
the interests and the destiny of San Francisco. The workingmen
and the business men of this city want whatever Congress may do
legitimately to support enterprise and promote trade by land and
sea, for by such means business makes work and labor gets wages.
Mr. Livernash announces himself as the esoteric apostle of sweet
ness and light. Both are fine, but their coming into the world did
not wait for the election of Mr. Livernash to Congress, nor depend
upon his re-election to a place for which he has not the least quali
fication. Workingmen want work and wages, and business men
want business and profits. When both have these they take care
of the leisure and sweetness and light in their own way. By idle
dreaming and idle visions, the work, wages and business of this
city may be sacrificed, and this the people do not want.
When Mr. Kahn was in Congress he looked out for our practical
business interests. He dwelt on good terms with his colleagues of
both parties, and enjoyed that popularity which is a powerful element
in a member's usefulness. Our people did not detect any deteriora
tion in the sweetness and light which Mr. Livernash seems tp think
ht invented. During Mr. Kahn's service he went about taking
care of our practical affairs in Congress in a sensible way. It was the
marvel and wonder of both parties in the House when he and Mr.
Loud were succeeded by such political curios as Livernash and
Wynn. San Francisco cannot afford to be fantastic more than once.
A joke should not be carried too far.? The action of, two years ,,ago
should be reversed, and having supplied a source of amusement and
.sometimes annoyance at Washington, it is time now to quit horse
play and get to business in the election of our Representatives.
WE cannot too much nor too plainly impress upon the voters
of this city the Heed of active, practical business Representa
tives in the House at Washington. While neither of the United
States Senators is from San Francisco, both have an intelligent con
ception of their duty to the metropolis of the State which they rep
resent. They have done what they could, and all they could, tor
this city, for its commerce and its facilities for holding its primacy
of Pacific trade.
f We have not suffered from inattention or neglect in the Senate,
but in the last session we had no representation in the House at all.
Mr. Livernash was busy in hifalutin plans for the remanufacture of
human society, but seemed to have no well digested idea of what he
wanted to do, and was hazy and uncertain about the, ground plan
and elevation of his Utopia. When his reveries were coined into
speech he became offensive to the House and was testy with his
colleagues, because they did not understand nor sympathize with his
vision of a new heaven and a new earth. When -he confronted any
thing practical his prejudices bristled and he treated it from a per
sonal and not a public standpoint. We have truthfully reported his
speeches in his present campaign, and those, who read them see in
them a dreamer of fantasies, who goes up and down mixing causes
and effects in a kaleidoscopic muddle, and picking out the inevitable
incidents of mortality as something that can be legislated out of ex
istence.

Morton has appointed a board of naval
officers to deliberate . upon improve
ments in the construction of torpedo
boat destroyers. The cruise of the
first torpedo-boat destroyer flotilla to
the Philippines from Hampton Roads

gation; Commander F. F. Blether, Lieu
tenant Lloyd H. Chandler and Lieu
tenant F. H. Clark. Lieutenant Chand

STOCKTON, Oct. 21.â A young girl,
still in her teens, was -brought In from
Tracy to-day and lodged in Jail. With
her was a male companion, with whom
she has ibeen beating : her way on
freight trains. When arrested she
wore masculine attire and for somo
time denied her sex, but at - last she
acknowledged the truth.
The woman said her name was LJa
zle Rodgers, that she war not yet 18,
but had been married three years ago
in Los Angeles. She left her husband
and joined an admirer named Delt, and
the two ; went to San Francisco, where
she donned man's clothing and worked
as a waiter. Tiring of tlils lift they
decided to tour theVcountry by the
brakebeam route and see the world.
They. had gone as far as Tracy, when
she attracted attention and was with
her male companion taken into custody
by a railroad .policeman.
Rev. Mr. Gillett of Traoy befriended
the girl, and at his home she was fur
nished with proper attire. She will be
held temporarily until her case can be

New Postmasters Appointed.
Â¦~ WASHINGTON, Oct. 21.â OÂ«org4
W. Kennedy has been appointed post
master at Cole Grove, CaL; Mary E.
Gardner at Sams Valley, Or.; O. L.
Hanse at Helceta, and Viola A. Bil
lings at Marlal, Or.
f Such an action, if put into operation. Is ex
travagant, because all Â¦ unnecessary taxation
is extravagant. . Neither Is it based on equity,
because It will not apply to all the children
that "are being â¢ educated, but only to those
who attend certain schools. >. It la â¢ dangerous
because it U another step toward Â¦ socialism.
Implying as a logical consequence the giving
later on of free. clothes and free food.
Now, I submit, that such an order of things
might bÂ« proper for a penitentiary,' but not
for a free people, especially one whose ante
cedents have made, for the bulldlpg up of -a
healthy individuality and who deemed tax*
atlon without necessity and representation as
unjustifiable and criminal. It is my opinion
for this and other reasons - the - amendment
ought to be 1 rejected.
In speaking of his letter Archbishop
Glennon said. to-day:
The sooner a consistent and determined stand
ia taken against whose cloak of
patriotism covers their real oppressive char
acter | the better It will j bÂ« for the taxpaylng
public This is not a political Issue, nor Is
it . one of religion; it is simply one of jua
tloÂ».' >:
ST. LOUIS, Oct.' 21. â Archbishop
Glennon of the Catholic diocese of St.
Louis to-day Issued a circular letter
protesting against the passage of an
amendment to be voted on at the com
ing election, providing for free text
books for public school children. The
letter states in part:
.MILWAUKEE, Wis., Oct 21.â The
Buckeye Gold Mining Company of Mil
waukee is involved in. a sensational
suit brought by Mrs. Louise C. Koester
of Baker, Or., who has been in the city
for some time trying to get access to
the books of the company. Judge Hal
sey has issued an alternative writ of
mandamus ordering the officers of the
company, all prominent Milwaukee
people, to appear in court Saturday
morning with the books so that the
case may be tested.
Mrs. Koester says that she owns
294,576 shares of stock in the company
at $1 each par value. She consulted M.
M. Riley and they went to the office of
the president of the company at 115
Buffalo street, where Otto Kuehn and
brother have a commission house. She
was told that the books were with the
secretary. She had previously been in
formed, she alleges, that the only of
fice of the company was at 115 Buffalo
street On the same day she and her
attorney found the office of the secre
tary, B. Kron, to be at 115 Huron
street. When she approached Kron for
the books she declared he said that
he would not transact business for the
mining company until after 6 o'clock.
Mrs. Koester charges In her applica
tion for the writ of mandamus that
the delay was evidently for the purpose
of "fixing" the books.
"Hold on there, Dr. Rader: that iÂ»
too strong," cried the masculine cham
pion of females from a seat up In front.
The editor went straight ahead, how
ever. His subject was /'The Effects of
Woman Suffrage as Seen by One Who
Went Through the Campaign for it in
Colorado." .
When the full effect of the feminine
wrath poured out upon â¢ the epigram
matic editor reached his ears In various
ways yesterday, Dr. Rader â¢ proceed
ed to explain. "The impression con
veyed by my remarks last T night," he
said, 'was far from what I intended.
In boiling down a twenty-minute
speech to a five-minute talk I did not
make myself clear. For more than
thirty years I have been a warm friend
to and an honorary member ' > of the
Women's Christian Temperance Union.
For many years I contended for woman
suffrage whenever my opportunity
happened to be. I had hoped that
wherever woman suffrage prevailed
there would exist something compar
able to our conception of the Garden
of Eden, but the results | of suffrage
in Colorado and Wyoming have not
been such as had been anticipated by
myself and other ardent supporters.
This failure, I take It, has been from
various reasons. . Briefly summarized
they are as follows: Many good women
do not desire the privilege of the bal
lot and will not vote. Women that do
vote are controlled much as men are
and they generally follow their, hus
band's lead. Nearly all bad women
vote and are Influenced by the most
vicious element."
Having dropped this bombshell into
the W. C. T. U. Convention, which was
waiting to ' hear good news about wom
an 'suffrage ' Thursday evening, " Rev. D.
L.' Rader,- editor of the Pacific Christian
Advocate, calmly,' proceeded -, to Â¦' . cast
other nuggets of j experience regarding
woman suffrage in the silver-lined com
monwealth before the Indignant assem
bly. He was quickly interrupted by
Dr. J. H. Glass of Los Angeles, who
was more susceptible to the . strong fe
male environment J j - Â¦â¢Â¦

General Convention to-day adopted a i
resolution in the House of Deputies I
providing for special forms of worship
to meet the reauirements of foreign Â»
congregations which mar be brought!
into the church. The resolution was'
presented some time ago by Dr. Wil-
Qua R. Huntington, of New York. The j
proposal was bitterly fought at the San j
Francisco convention and met with |
much opposition in Boston, many as- \
serting that the measure would lead'
to great diversity in forms of worship, j
The resolution will be acted UDon 'by |
the House of Bishops. !
The deputies to-<Jay elected the four]

John McLaren, superintendent ' of
Golden' Gate Park, recently about the
cricket ground which the Park Com

people's playground. The site proposed
is oh the south side of the Park, to 'the
south of the Spreckels music stand and
to the west of the polo field. When some
trees have been cut down and grubbed
out and the 'ground-, leveled a fair
ground can be made. Work will begin
soon. I
When the great . athletic ground is
ready for use, which will , not be for
more ; than a year, there will be a
large, perfectly level space of 450 feet
by 350 feet inside -the runnings track
and the superintendent" says that this
might be available for cricket players.
Meanwhile, however, the, ground, to .the
west. of the polo field will be prepared.'
This is sheltered by well grown trees
and will make a suitable spot for the
game.' Cricketers resident In this city
will be â¢ delighted to have a ground
within easy reach for practice and
more accessible .to spectators than any

per annum salary, with the privilege
to draw against the same at any time

their business, which they promised to
repay as soon as they disposed of a

Â¦-After Smith had commenced to dress
he was told by one of the , committee
that Whitney demanded the third set
by default. To say Smith was sur
prised when he heard this would . be
putting it mildly.

the match between R. N. Whitney and
Grant Smith which was started but not
completed on the park courts last Sun
day. It was a clever exhibition of ten
nis, and throughout the first two sets
there was absolutely no display of Ill
feeling between the contestants.
The first set was close and . went to
Smith by a small margin. \ He also won
the second set by a score of G-4.
The third set was started after 5
o'clock 'when darkness was but a few

point of the opening game, and Smith
won the second, making the score

As. indicating the .number Y>f guns

The members of the Alameda Gun
Club, who have an extensive preserve
on the Sonoma marsh, had poor, shoot

for twenty-two guns was only twelve
birds.
The Montezuma Club, which is
something of a family organization,
had a successful opening day at the
Collinsville preserve. The wives of
three members were on hand with six
teen gauge guns and enjoyed the sport.
President W. W. Richards and wife
secured twenty ducks. Six of these
were "red heads," a species of canvas
back, but a rarer bird. George H.
Newman and wife had a splendid
string of mallard and canvasback. Mr.
and Mrs. T. J. Walsh, J. F. Nickels
and -W. C. Swain all had moderate
sized strings of big birds. The ponds

forty splendid birds. A. D. Harrison
brought down nineteen and A. F. Hop
ke - twenty. Mr. Cummlng saw six
"cans,*' but they were out of range.
Nine members of the Pastime Club
secured, limit bags at Mount Eden on
opening day.
Charles Shaw had a good shoot at
Alvarado. Joe BickerstofC and Pete
McRae were among the men who se
cured limit bags at Mount Eden.
J. Harvey killed twenty-six ducks
near Vallejo. R. C. Reed picked up
twenty-three at Napa.
Down at the Empire Club there
were a lot of birds, but they moved
out in a hurry when shooting began.
F. Blair Turpin, J. B. Hauer and a
third member secured a joint bag of
ninety. X.
Ed. Kerrison shot at Antioch and
secured a string of mallards and some
English snipe. Dave Herefleld, shoot-

Altogether the, situation is quite sat

made by the varsity against. the Mult
nomah last Tuesday has been a source
of great encouragement to players;
coaches and the general student body
in view of the fact that Stanford could
not score on the northern team. .
The blue and gold eleven is working
more coherently than heretofore and
several new plays are being practiced.
Coach Hopper is laboring assiduously
to make his men' play more rapidly.
There is an opportunity for great im
provement in this respect.
The players are all in excellent con
dition and few calls have to be made
upon the doctors. Heitmuller Is do
ing well with the punting and the
ends are getting down faster to nail
the man who catches the ball. The
interference is growing much better.
The men on the rush line are. doing
as Tvell almost as could be expected
of them, with the exception of the
ends. The quarterback's position .is
a trifle weak, but Kitrelle and other
candidates . for the place are. getting
plenty of work cut out for them. A
few tricks have been learned and. are
being tried occasionally on the sec
ond eleven.
FORCE OF CALIFORNIA TRYINCt FOR A GOAL FR03I PLACEMENT, WHILE CAPTAIN STROUD IS PRACTICING PASSING BALL.
The Blue and Gold has probably
the best of the argument in running
backs. Kern is the best half in the
Western game to-day, according tp
the men who know football and have
seen both teams play. Lasater Is cer
tain to gain more ground in the big
contest than "Jim" unless the
Cardinal man learns to get his head
down. Bansbach and Stott are both
superior to Kitrelle at auarter - be
cause of the latter's slowness.- Cali
fornia has other candidates for the
position, however, and should be
much stronger in any event for the
bier same than she is to-day.
Stroud is in a class by himself at
center, and Stern, Force and Heitmul
ler are well worthy to help him in
the line. California's ends at pres
ent are inferior to Stanford's in
breaking up plays and getting down
on punts. Up to date the Blue and
Gold line is much 'better than Stan
ford's, but with Sprott and Thompson
back in the game the Cardinal will
make an improved showing. Stanford
needs a strong line to stop Mead,
White, Graves. Kern and Lasater.
Neither team has shown that it
possesses any particularly strong play
if exception is made of the Cardinal
outside-of- tackle plunge which Cali
fornia will surely learn how to stop
before November 12. Stanford needs
some one who is a sure punter to go
into the championship contest.
If the Blue and Gold detachment
does not - go stale and if Lanagan
makes the possible and expected imÂ»
provements in his team., the betting
should be even for the big game.
The championship football game be
tween the University of California and
the Stanford University teams is only
three weeks distant and none of the
critics dares hazard an opinion â¢Â»Â«Â» to
which squad is the better. A com
parison of scores furnishes food for ar
gument but gives no light on the situ
ation. The average eleven from the
Blue and Gold varsity squad of six
teen men is at least a touchdown
stronger than Lanagan's average team
of from twenty-five to thirty men. That
does not prove by any menas that the
number of men who may play . for
California can defeat the same num
ber of cardinal supporters. Lana
gan's wonderful achievement last year
in bringing his men to the pink of
condition on the day of the big game
leads the critics to conclude he will
do so again next month.
There is such a thine as bringing
men into shape too quickly and then
having them pro stale. This is Cali
fornia's greatest danger at. present.
"Pete" Smith, "All-American" Cava
naugh and a number of other grid
iron experts believe Coach Hopper is
playing too few men and using them
too hard. Lanagan plays his pre
liminary games exclusively for prac
tice and gives every possible candidate
for the- varsity a chance to show
whnt he can do. California plays
every game to win.
TARS AT BASEBALL
STANFORD UNIVERSITY. Oct. 21.
â The week ha* been fruitful of great
Improvement in the playing of Stan
ford's varsity squad. With the fresh
men out of the way, the two big
teams have had unhampered posses
sion of the field and undivided atten
tion from the coaches, a state of af
fairs that has shown marked results
already. Another circumstance fa
vorable to rapid improvement is the
fact that most of the men who were
off duty on account of injuries have
resumed their moleskins and are
again working: back into form.
C. E. Hyde, a strong: candidate for
varsity center, is aerain in the field,
after a vacation of two weeks with
water on the knee. West, an aspirant
for right, and who was suffering the
same malady, is able to practice again.
Sunny Jim Weller. the Cardinal star
fullback, was sent to bed last night
threatened with a watery kneecap, but
escaped a severe case. He is playing
with a special knee harness imported
from the East to protect him against
a renewal of the injury.
Shields, who injured his hand in the
machine-shop several days ago, is the
only veteran player now off the squad.
If he returns before any further
casualties occur It will be the first
time since the season's beginning that
Stanford has mustered her full var
sity force.
The advent of two more old players
this week has changed- Stanford's out
look materially. W. K. Sprott, who
made his appearance Wednesday, is
one of the strongest tackles ever pro
duced by the cardinal. The problem
of organizing a rush line has been sim
plified by his addition, but has brought
up a pretty problem for the coaches.
It is probable that Shields will be put
back into the center position, where he
was tried for a while recently, and
Freshman Horton substituted in his
old position of left tackle.
Preston is the other veteran who ap
peared this week. He will make a
strong try for risht end against Smith,
last year's varsity player. Preston \
made his "S" in 1902, but was out with
an injury last season.
Roosevelt and Dole, the two varsity
men who were released from the hos
pital last week, are able to go into the
hardest scrimmage work and their
strength is being felt plainly. Dole's ,
punting is growing more effective â¢
dally.
Twenty minutes' scrimmage work be
tween the first and second elevens has I
become a regular part of the daily
routine. In this practice Head Coach
Lanagan directs the work of the var
fcity, while Assistant Coach Hauver
cian guides the second team. The two
EQuads seem almost equally strong now
and the varsity has to put forth every
effort to secure one touchdown in the
time allowed. Increase of speed and
better team work mark the practice
each day. Â»

While the majority.of the sportsmen

to stay the limit, but the latter ws\s
nearly in and never had a chance in
any round. -He showed some . clever

lefts to the body overcame the youth.

after the latter went out from an im
aginary wallop Referee Greggains' in

The entry list for the Pacific Athletic
Association handicap field day, which
takes place to-day on Berkeley oval,
has exceeded that of any* similar meet
held on' this - coast -There are some
flifty individuals ' participating in the
eleven events.
- With Abadie and Snedigar absent
from the 100-yard dash, it seems a
toss-up as to the winner, the majority
of the entries being new men. If Cope
is in good form he should win. .
The 220-"yard dash should bring out
Wllcox, Cope .and Kliieberger among
the winners. The quarter mile event
has fifteen entries. All are first-class
men and should make a fine^race. â¢
The half-mile and mile runs should
be the best eve'nts-of the day. The
scratch menâ Miller^ Glarner, Newhall
and Cliffordâ are all runners with
first-class records. The winner may
establish a new mark. Last spring
Miller came closer' to doing this than
any athlete for -some years past.
While 'here are only three entries in
the pole vault, a fine contest is expect
ed, as Dole, Irwin and Whitaker are
among the test vaulters in 'the coun
try.
Plaw will be seen to advantage in
the weights. In practice last week he
threw the 16-pound hammer 1S4 feet.

T5Â» ootrocO of irar on the Brltt-
G&na Cghl failed to select a referee for
the contest last night alter three hours
of cansaltatian at Harry Oorbetfa. Al
Berfard represented the lightweight
champion, while Willie Britt spoke for
Brother Jim. The pair were sailing on
different tacks all through the confer
ence asd conJd not get together on any
one man. . .
"Willie stood pal for Eddie Graney or
Eddie Smith. Herford proposed first
an Eastern man, then mentioned John
Consldine. Duncan McDonald of Butte
and Mcrrison of Seattle. Finally with
a. serlona face he mention <d Jack
Grant of Portland.
That narna proved like a red rag to
Britt. "Say, are you kidding me?"
ha asked.
"No, Pm on the sauare.** replied
Herford. "He Is a good man."
"To the woods with him," said Britt
Â¦with xnnch Tehemence. "We ought to
hare a home man. The people want a
local man."
"I have too ranch to lose to take any
cnances," said Gans* manager. "Tn
not making any cracks, but I cant af
ford to be a victim of circumstances.**
Tre something. to lose myself," re
torted Impresario 'Britt. *Tve named
my men. Yours dont look good to
me."
Then the conference took on an as
pect of airy persiflage, badinage, rep
artee and pish tush. .
"I propose Mike Fisher," suggested
the man in the corner.
"This is not a Joke," said Britt.
"Is Mike Fisher a Joker* asked the
man In the corner. The problem was
passed up.
"It's up to you, kido," said Herford.
"How. about Phil Wand?** asked
Britt. .
"I beg your pardon, did you speak?"
retorted Gans' manager.
"Will you take the Job, Mr. Cor
bett?" asked Britt. - "Please," added
Herford. Harry Corbett positively de
clined and the conference began to
yawn and think of the feathers. -
At this Juncture James -W. Coffroth,
manager of the Shasta Club, Inter
vened. "If you don't decide upon a
referee on Monday I will appoint one.
You are supposed to appoint one ten
days before the fight."
Both managers stood pat and the
conference adjourned until 8:30 on
Monday night at Harry Corbetfs.
Jimmy Britt is increasing his staff of
trainers and advisers at his quarters
et CroII's Gardens in Alameda, Curt
nichardson, who has assisted Jimmy
In preparing for several of his previous
ring: battles, Joined the camp yesterday
and next Monday the redoubtable
Fpider Kelly will register at Croll's.
Kichardson and Kelly, with Frank
Rafael and Charley Kreling, will com
plete Britt's training staff.
Kid McCoy, in a telegram received
by Britt yesterday, offered to go to
Alameda and lend Jimmy whatever aid
he could in getting himself in trim for
the colored champion, Joe Gans. Jim
my, while appreciating McCoy's kind
neFS. considered he is now sufficiently
supplied with coachers and condition
ers and. declined McCoy's * offer with
thanks. Jim Morley, the Los Angeles
baseball magnate, who is the manager
cf McCoy, sent Britt a telegram of
EX>od wishes. A number of other friends
of the poDUlar fighter in Los Angeles
forwarded him a pair of {rood luck
gloves and a pair of army hair
brushes, the latter, beautifully mounted
and engraved. These tokens were sent
to Jimmy as presents, his birthday
having been the 5th of this month.
Road running: and surf bathing con
stituted Britt's programme yesterday
morning. In the afternoon ' he went
â¢into his gymnasium and boxed , four
rounds with Rafael. He also skipped
the rope 1000 times, tossed the medicine
ball and wrestled with Kreling.
Amongf the visitors to Britt's camp
yesterday were Assistant Chief John
Dougherty of the Fire Department and
Professor De Witt Van Court. - : '
The problem of Joe Gans making 133
pounds ringside for his coming, battle
â¢with Jimmy Britt was practically set
tled yesterday when the lightweight
champion -mounted the scales and an
nounced to the doubtful ones that the
beam tipped at 134% pounds. Froni now
until the date of the contest all will
apparently be clear sailing, barring ac
cidents.
The Marin County weather Is ideal
for reducing; and Frank McDonald
t ays Joe can make 133 pounds at will.
Joe worked hard yesterday and
pleased his many admirers. He was
on tlie road at an'early hourand took
his usual run of fourteen miles. This
was followed by a brisk rubdown.
In the afternoon he took a horseback
ride over the â¢ hills, but returned at 3
o'clock and spent an hour, in the gym
nasium. He started the afternoon's
work by skipping the rope 1000 . limes.
This is a favorite stunt . of Joe's and
brings Â«eut the perspiration quickly. .
Bag punching, shadow- boxing .J and
four- fast rounds with Kid Sullivan
completed his day's work. - *
Joe seems to be In fine condition and
Bays he Is ready to enter . the ring at a

Red Devereaux, who dropped it and
away it rolled tovrard the Tigers'

Quick as a flash, Francks was there
to pick up the sphere. Nordyke had
all but gained the plate and there
seemed not the slightest chance to
head him off, especially as the pan
was surrounded by. players. . Buck's
wing was true and Nordyke was nailed

COLLEGE ELEVENS TO PLAY.
Several weeks ago. when it was
found necessary for the Tax . Collector
to make a final settlement with the
Treasurer, there was an apparent
shortage of about $12,000. Burke claim
ed the difference in accounts was due
to a clerical error in his books. His
bondsmen made good the amount,
pending an investigation of the records.
The bondsmen's experts and those of
the Grand Jury found no discrepancies
except as to a sum of money paid over
in tax collections.
SANTA BARBARA, - Oct. 21.â The
Grand Jury this evening filed its final
report in which County Tax Collector
Edmund M. Burke" Is charged with
"corrupt conduct in office." It further
states that a written accusation has
been filed against Burke with the Dis
trict Attorney, who has been instructed
to proceed against him on account of
an alleged shortage found in his ac
counts.

NEW TORK. Oct. 21.â There was a revival
of speculative excitement In Etocto to-day
There was some uncertainty in the^srly
1^2 Â«jÂ»,^. aeCllllTely <*Â«**Â« yesterday's
late rally, bot as soon as thlÂ» was seen to be
t.on The rtse was uneven, one point and th*n

the Important stocks came In for their share
of the adrance. The tide cf the market was

This k:na of trading is made on changes and
the trader is in the market many times cn

feKgrerate of the total dealings, without per
r.ayt oSectiruj any actual transfer of holdings
Â«t ail. Tlie belief that a contract for trans

Haven to toe made was the principal .Influence
in the market. The' renewed influence in
I'nion Pacific, after a period of hesitation
ar.d a more substantial basis in the connidera

movÂ«aent. but they were late in getting
s-tarted. and did not hold well. Amalgamated
Oipper was affected by disappointment that
the dividend had net been raUed on yester

pain, which failed cf reflection on last week's

statement by the working cf the average sya

read* the profit-taking in the la>i hour quite
bumTT- The result was an irregular move
nent during the final hour and eontfdleratole
curtailment of best prices, the leading West

A carload of fancy Colorado Apples of the
York Imperial variety, a new variety in this
market, was placed on sale. They were of good
quality and highly colored and met with a.
good demand at $1 60 per box. Four carloads
of fancy Oregon stock are rolling this way
and are expected to-day. The market for local
.Apples was reported in good shape, with trade
active, particularly in fancy stock, and occa
sional sales of some varieties were reported
at a slight premium. - There were no Bartlett
Pears or reaches offering, and as there are no
more expected tbe quotations are withdrawn.
Figs were in limited supply and firm. Sonoma
stock selling at 90c6$l per box and offering*
from other sections at C0i{j75c. ~ Table Grapes
were steady under a fair demand for local
use and shipping. Open boxes were In limited
supply and firm, but prices still had a wide
range as to variety and size of package. Large
boxes from Martinez sold up to SI 75 for Mus.
; cat and (1 50 for Cornlchon while the top for
; other varieties was fl 25. Â¦ Wine Grapes were
in good request and available supplies of good
stock cleaned up quickly at good prices. Some
low-grade offerings of table Grapes were sold
for wine at $12@15 per ton. Receipts of Rasp,
berries and the Cheney variety of Strawberries
came to hand late and had to be held over.
Early arrivals of Strawberries cleaned up
readily. It 1* believed that there will be a
scarcity of Cranberries after the old stock,
which is now lying around the market, has
been cleaned up. Additional supplies of the
Cape Cod article are rolling this way and fall
due during the first week of November. Present
Indications are that the opening price for these '
will be $9 75 per barrel. 'Â¦ . â¢

Local brokers continue to report Increasing
firmness in most sizes of Prunes, though the
Improvement is slow. The large and small
sizes meet with most attention, and the mid

which has heretofore marked the Prune mar
ket seems to be passing away.* The other
fruits, though firm, are quiet, as stocks have

houses are doing some fierce cutting. Some
dealers reported yesterday that they were of
fered Eastern Hams at 124c. Prices for -all
three descriptions are lower and Hams are
now selling below cost of importation. That
tbe war is purely local is shown by the fol
lowing wire -from Chicago yesterday: "The
market is showing more - steadiness in pro
visions at present range; there is less pressure
from outside liquidation 'and the packing in

scrlptions show no change. A dispatch from
Chicago yesterday said:
'The Livestock World asks. "Whence ceuaes
the Hogs so suddenly and with such a rush?"
They have come from hogless solitudes in mul
titudes WhÂ«re a few weeks ago credible- re
ports declared no Hoga existed, swarms have
materialised. When thÂ« country Is said to
be bare of Hogs look out. .but-' some reaaon
must be assigned for this rush. ; The poor
quality is slgnflcant. Why are growers so
anxious to cash in their pordne possessions so
suddenly? One reason assigned Is that cattle
feeding operations will be little and conse
quently comparatively few Hogs will be re
quired for feed lot operations." . -. ; â¢
The weakness in Butter continues and the
pressure to sell among some houses Is acute.
Fine creamery was freely offered yesterday at
28c. and. some was offered as low as 27%c.
At the same time other houses reported -that
they could get 29c for their choicest goods.
Tbe extreme depression was In the medium and
lower grades, which were offered freely at
22%@23c, and even lower In some Instances.
Owing to the early rains the old feed has been
destroyed . and the cows are , now feeding on
the new green grass, which Is soft and full
of water, hence the Butter is now running
soft and without firm consistency and does
not. keep. Consequently nobody wants to hold
it. Another cause of, weakness is the excessive
dullness In trade already mentioned.
Eggs are doing better. Fine fresh ramh
are cleaned up and getting scarce, while the
demand is brisk. There Is no further change
in Cheese.
Receipts were 27,500 lbs Butter. 545 cases'
Eggs and 50C0 lbs Cheese.

"It Is a debatable question." said Mr.
XVoodworth, "whether the bonds for
merly accepted by Mr. North can be
collected should they be declared for
feited."
United States District Attorney
Woodvorth made a discovery yester
day that is of much importance in the
matter of the Chinese that have been
passed through this port to the St. Louis
exposition. They are all under bonds
of $500 each, the bonds being given to
Hart North, United States Immigrant
Commissioner at this port. Mr. Wood
worth is doubtful whether these bonds,
which were not submitted to him, but
passed upon and accepted by Mr.
North, can be collected in case the
Chinese fail to go out of the United
States at the close of the exposition.
Thirty-five Chinese who arrived by
the steamer China on October 13 on
the way to St. Louis, yesterday pre
sented bonds of the surety company
which had a monopoly of the business
of the bureau. These being the first
bonds that have been offered since
Chief Mehan was placed at the head
of the bureau. Mr. Mehan presented
them to Attorney Wood worth for ex
amination. They were modeled upon
the bonds already accepted, and Wood
worth made thirty corrections and ad
ditions to each before he would ac
cept them.
Charles Mehan, chief of the Chinese
Bureau, recently discovered a fraudu
lent Chinese certificate of registration
in the hands of a Chinese fisherman,
who gave his name as Wong Shue
and who came down from Alaska as
one of the fishing fleet. The certificate
was genuine, but the photograph of
the real Wong Shue had been removed
and that of the holderâ the pretended
Wong Shueâ substituted. Wong will
take a trip to China at the expense of

A modest heroine held the attention
and the admiration of a large crowd in
the Coroner's office â¢ yesterday j morning
while "she was telling the Jury, of her
plucky : ; but unsuccessful . . attempt to
save one of ' her fellow creatures.;
The heroine is Miss Fay, a handsome
young woman residing at 834 Grove
Btreet and sister of Charles W. Fay of
the City; Hall.. ..' ". ~. : Z .-:
. Her story was told with a candor and
simplicity altogether devoid of self-;
consciousness. It was on October. 13
when' she witnessed a gasoline .torch
explode in the, hands of painter Charles
Edward Young, who was working on a'
house at r 817 Grove street, across^ the
street from her residence. -The burning
fluid . enveloped the luckless man . from
head tb;foot- and he, ran shrieking, Into,
the street. Miss Fay shouted to- him
to troll ton; the "ground, but the torture
"of the flre prevented Young from hear-^
ing .or /understanding the advice./ Â£ Miss
Fay seized a blanket and,' unmindful
of her own peril, ran up to the blazing
man > and wrapped it around/ him;
Bcorchirig/'her^ hands while doing \ so.
Butjhis /act I of . running into ; the'; street
had fanned the flames so that his burns'
proved fatal. three days. later.
. One of the ; Jurors. ; . remarked immedi
ately^after/theiinquest that Miss â¢ Fay,
ought to be rewarded \ with a medal or
a 'husband by the appreciative com
munity. . The verdict was "accidental
death." ; , c -
