ST. PETERSBURG, Feb. 29.-rThe
statement of the, commander of the

press correspondent to-day and was
received as a complete and satisfac

pressed that the incident had created
so much' feeling here.
"We had no official advices on the
subject," said an official, "but as the
incident was attracting much attention
here it is a source of gratification to
learn that the statements were not only
untrue, 'but 'that .the Vicksburg was
the first" to render aid. We desire to
preserve, the most amicable relations

the- truth Is generally known, it will
doubtless go far toward , allaying the

CALL BUREAU, HOTEL BARTON,
WASHINGTON. Feb. ,29.â The Russian
embassy in Washington denies that the
original report charging that Comman
der Marshall of the American cruiser
Vicksburg had refused to rescue Rus
sian sailors at Chemulpo came from
Russia, and says it came from English
sources. It is asserted that Russia
will investigate as to the origin of the
report, believing It was part of a plan
to draw the United States Into the
troubles In the Far East. The Rus
sian embassy does not deny that its
Government protested against the re
ported Inhumanity of Commander Mar
shall, but this -was on the assumption
that the report was true. Neither is
ft denied that' the report created great
hostility toward the United States In
Russia, but this is. said to have been
Just what the English opponents of
Russia desired when they circulated the
statement that Commander Marshall
had refused aid to drowning Russian
sailors when their ships were sunk aft
er an unequal contest in a neutral har
bor. The Russian Embassador .has
no criticism of Commander Mar
shall since his explanation was given
to this Government, but he intimates
that the whole misunderstanding is
part of a scheme of the English press
and English diplomats to create a
breach between Russia and the. United
States.

ST. PETERSBURG, Feb. 29.â An un

evening that two Russian battleships
and a torpedo-boat have been sunk at
Port Arthur.
LONDON, March 1.â The pause, in
the war operations in the Far East
has been broken by another Japanese
attack on Port Arthur, of which only
a brief .account is yet at hand. This,
report, however, shows a repetition of
the now familiar tactics of Japan, and
it is presumed that this attack was
made in bad weather, previous tele
graphic advices having reported a se
vere gale raging at Port Arthur. As
usual, the Japanese did not remain
long enough off the harbor to enable
the. gunnera at the fort to get their
range. Again at this time the three
cruisers â the Bayan. the Askold and
Novik â came out to meet the attack
and this suggests that either they were
the only effective ships there or that
the larger battleships were unable to
get out.
No news is published here this morn
ing of operations or movements other
than af Port Arthur.

BERLIN, Feb. 29.â Count von Bulow,
the imperial Chancellor, began a speech
in the Reichstag to-day by saying he*
had left his Pick room, in obedience to a
telephone call informing him that Herr
Bebel, ..the Socialist leader in the
Reichstag, was going to make a "thun
dering speech."
This statement apparently reflects
the importance which the Ministry at
taches to the Socialist attack on the
Government arising from the activity
of Russian police agents in Prussia
against Russian subjects who are sus
pected of leing anarchists. The discus
sion of this matter was resumed in the
Reichstag to-day before crowded gal
leries.
Herr Bfbel and Herr Haas (Social
Democrat) reiterated substantially the
charges they made on January 19, and
the Socialists offered a resolution ask
ing for thÂ« denunciation of the existing
treaty of extradition between Germany
and Russia. To this Herr von Kardoff,
the Conservative member, replied that
It would be an unfriendly act, infring
ing on neutrality, to make such a de
mand upon Russia under the existing
circumstcnc.es.
Herr li?bel read a statement made by
Russian students protesting against the
Imputation of Foreign Secretary Rich
thofen that they were anarchists, and
asserted; that the Government was
going sojfar in Us subserviency that It
was undermining the honor and. dignity
of the country. Â¦.-,'â¢Â» Â¦
"No hMf way decent man," he de
clared, 'Van defend the maintenance of
the present treaty."
Count jvoh Bulow asserted a second
time that the activity of the Russian
agents tyi Prussia was confined exclu
sively tiward anarchist suspects. No
Innocent foreigners were molested in
Germany. .-He referred to the recent
declaration by Slav students as 4m
pertinent and' asserted, amid loud ap
plause from the Rightists, that he
would like to expel such students from
German}. . &}7x-&
Herr Haas said Germany's present
attitude toward Russia was a shame On
civilization..
â¢ Dr. Schoenstadt doubted the sincerity
o* the Socialist assurance that litera
ture smuggled into Russia was harm
less and not of anarchist tendencies.
He said the fact that documents had
been shipped about the country labeled
"shoes" and that such a package was
found near Tilsit, which, the shipper
said, came from the office of the Voer
waert3. This made a singular Impres
sion.
V.on Hammerstein denied that Rus
sian agents exercised functions belong
ing; exclusively to the Prussian police.
Baron von Richthoefn said:
"As. the United States Government
has prohibited the immigration of an
archists, we also intend to keep these
people at arms' leneth."
Herr Bebel recited an instance where
two Russian spies were flogged In Paris
upon being discovered in an assembly
of Russian students.
"They seemed to have no appreciation
In Paris," said he, "for such dirty work
a3 .is tolerated and indeed boasted of
In Germany. There Is still "so much
of the. old spirit of the lackey In the
German" character." :
â¢ â¢ .ibiihu Root served as Secretary of
War at a great pecuniary sacrifice.
His salary as a Government official
was- a mere drop In -the bucket com
pared ta what his income as a corpora
tion lawyer would ha've been. Mr.
Root had' been in the. Cabinet about
two months when he received a letter
from": some people he had represented
in a big suit to break a will where a
couple of million dollars' were involved.
He won the case for his clients, and
the. letter 'contained a check for his
services. The check, was for $125,000.
Mr. 'Root received $8000 a year as a
Cabinet" officer. ; :
.As soon as it was announced about
.twp. months' ago that Mr. Root would
l?ave the War Department on Febru
ary 1 letters began to pour In on him
asking for his legal services. Retain
ing fees were forced on him before he
even had a chance to talk with persons
who sought to- engage him. This thing
kept up to the day he left the War
Department. Of course, he was
obliged to turn down many of the of
fer's he received, and it is safe to say
that he could have taken on enough
work that came unsolicited to keep
him busy for the next two or three
Years. Â¦
Mr. Root's prestige as a lawyer has
been immeasurably enhanced by his
services at Washington, and he Â¦will

The State Department has received
a copy, through the Russian embassy,
*<;f the imperial decree fixing contra
band of war during the pYesent strug
gle, precisely as it appeared In the press
dispatches this morning. Relative to
the declaration that rice and foodstuffs
are contraband of war. it is said at
the Siate Department that the desti
nation of such goods must .determine
their character. If they are intended
for cither army they are contraband
and rubjf-ct to seizure. If they are in
tended for. the use erf civilians, except
in the case of besieged towns, they
must not be seized, or If seized they
must be paid for. That is the doc
trine !aid down by the United States
Government in the Transvaal war and
will be upheld during the present war.
Russia has made no prcrtest to the
Government against the granting of
permission to land the cable at Guam.
It is assumed by Washington officials
that if a protest be made it will be
filed through regular diplomatic chan
nels. What action the United States
would take in that event cannot be
foretold, as it would depend entirely
on the circumstances of the case.
IU.ShI.VS PROBABLE PROTEST.
Â»t t<Â» ascertain how the United States
v.ould view such an application if it
were made. No decision has been
rei.rhed. although in the light of pres
ent information there is a manifest
disposition to regard ?uch a6 request
as entirely reasonable and proper.
SECRETARY HAVS ARGD3IENT.
It is considered that "the laying of
the cable would be a purely commer
cial transaction and that the granting
of permission for the landing of the
cable at Guam would not violate in
any sense the position of neutrality^
which the United States has assumed
in respect to the Russo-Japanese con
flict. As heretofore indicated. If the
permission should be granted it is quite
likely that the use of the cable, dur-
Jng the progress of the war at least!
might be hedged about by certain con
ditions, but even as to that point no
Â«2efinite decision has been reached. It
is said at the War Department that
this is the only outlet possible for Ja
pan under the present concessions. The
Great Northern Company, It is said, is
the only company which has cables^
running into Japan, and that Is a Dan
ish company which is under Russian
control, it being ihe land line along
the Siberian Railway to the Asiatic
coast.
ST. PETERSBURG. Feb. 2?.â If an
attempt i*> made to lay a cable from
the inland of Guam to Japan during
the continuance c-f hostilities it will be
repaid< d as i-<>niraband <>f war un
dtr the proclamation promulgated yes
terday. As pointed out to the press,
the proclamation is ppecific on this
IÂ»'im. and it is not believed here that
the I'nitrd States will undertake or
authorize su<n a cable now, as it would
constitute a breach erf neutrality, ac
cordlng to thÂ«* Russian view.
WASHINGTON. Feb. 29.â Thus far
s V .. . -
the United States Government has not
received formally an application from

United' States' Minister Allen cables
the. State Department from Seoul that,
in pursuance of an arrangement he has
made with the \ Japanese' Minister, a
returning transport will bring Ameri
cans from Pingyang, a point in North
west Korea, near' the border of Man
churia. The Americans in Seoul and
vicinity have already- been sent tb the
Philippines. Allen says that Russian
scouts, on arriving at Pingyang yes
terday, were pursued by the Japanese.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 29.â The Rus

MOSCOW, Feb. 29.â A -large repre

was held here- yesterday to discuss the
best methods of assisting .the Russian
wounded during- the war In the- Far
East. At the .close of the .meeting a
telegram was dispatched* Â» the .Czar,
expressing unbounded loyalty to him.
He Immediately replied, expressing hkÂ«
heartfelt gratitu.de for .the not)le
thought which Inspired the message
and the sentiments voiced toward-him
self, adding:
"I see in these- expressions tiew tes
timony of a determination on the part,
of the Russian nobles to serve . tHelr
Emperor as they did in former. daya
and to work in common with the sons
of Russia for the welfare *of our dear
fatherland." : 'âÂ¦:"':
PLANNING TO ASSIST
RUSSIAN WOUNDED
DURING THE COMBAT
"The most brilliant success of the
State Department has certainly been
the telegraphed ratification of the trade
treaty with Chin*. The Paris Temps
very neatly compares this with a "cus
tom said to be in vogue in the United
States of marriage by telephone. Cer
tainly this new editioti of modern poli
tics has not been much to our taste.
"At the present moment the appoint
ment of American Consuls to various
points in Manchuria is singularly in
appropriate, as Is also the demand to
Russia for recognition of those Con
suls. Having effected that master
stroke, Mr. Hay's next move was to
obtain the neutrality of China and ad
ministrative integrity of the Celestial
empire. We cannot but admit that this
is ahother feather tn the cap of the
United States' Secretary of State.
"At all events, we cannot bUt regret
to note the tone of hostility prevailing
!n Washington. This to a large extent
w ill counteract' a'li friendship that has
hitherto existed between ourselves" and
the United States.- Surely intelligent
Yankees will find it difficult to point to.
a spot where their trade, interests are
being threatened by Russia." â¢ ' /.
The Bourse Gazette says: "There Is
no need for alarm over, the blockade at
Port Arthur. The war will not end
until not a single Japanese is left alive
in Korea. The successes of*, the Rus

. The Korean Minister here refuses to
believe the reported Japanese-Korean
treaty, which he describes as "an Eng-.
lish invention." He declares the whole'
document is absurd. The Minister has
become a popular figure since he cami>
out as a strong partisan of Rflssla and
gave $25 -toward the fund being raised

ST. PETERSBURG. Feb. 29.â People
here wonder what the United States
can mean by doing almost everything
passible which can be disagreeable to
Russia at the present time. The Novoe
Vrcmya voice* public sentiment here
by saying:
"Official circles in Washington have
shown an amount of hostility to Rus
sia for which we are at a loss to ac
count. So far we know of no efffense
given by us to the United States. The
Washington Government, however, ap
pears to- lose no opportunity of fixing
upon evidence that can be raked up in
order to show Its ill-feeling toward
Russia. But the sum total .of such
facts can only at best be very insig
nificant.

The report of the commander of the American cruiser Vlcks

tary Taft to-day transmitted to the
House the petition of the Tobacco
Workers' Guild of the Philippines,Isl
ands praying /or a reduction in the
tariff on tobacco. The guild is de
clared to represent 6000 tobacco work

Avorkera received, twice the amount of
wages under Spanish rule that thy
do now, the daily wages at that time
being 50 gents. Prices of the neces
saries of life, it is said, have increased
three-fold under American rule.

advises the department of a report of
General Wood concerning an engage
ment at Jolo on the 14th! Inst.: with the
remnants of Hassan's Datto; Moros:
The American expedition was in charge
of Major Hugh L. Scott: During 'the
MANILA, Feb.-' 29".â General Leonard
Wood reports, under date of February
15, an engagement, with the Datto
Moros under Hassan on the Island of
Jolo. Lieutenant West and six privates
were wounded. One has' since died. The
Moro loss was heavy. Hassan succeed
ed in- making his escape. His original
force of 3000*. has how been reduced to
fifteen. The island is now under con
trol of the American authorities, and
influential Moros are aiding in the pur

It is said at the War, Department
that this destruction of Hassan's band"
is a case of retributive justice. Major
Scott suffered at the hands of this fan

to. be friendly, and in ambush shot
him. Since that time. Major Scott has

tempt to seize the fortress. The general
declares the Japanese consider the
seizure of Port Arthur to be a question
of national honor and, from their ob

LIAOYANG, Manchuria, Feb. 29.â
Foreigners living at Yinkow say that
the Japanese fleet has received orders
to attack and capture Port Arthur on
March 1 at all costs.
"It |3 confirmed that a Japanese tor

An official news agency to-day pub
lished the following dispatlh from Port

" According to advices from Peking.

Japanese Minister that the attitude o(
the Japanese living ij*. China, who for

INCITING A CHINESE RISING.
Official opinion continues to be that
the Japanese will make no attempt to
invest Port Arthur immediately, al
though it is added that they are evi
dently determined to force matters as
rapidly as possible. In 1S99 they landed
on the northern part of the peninsula
and the. Chinese made no resistance;
still it took twenty-eight days before
Port Arthur was really invested. The
object of the Japanese may now be to
avoid this preliminary delay by" disem
barking their troops at Pigeon Bay.
"It they do," said a naval expert.
"they will meet with opposition which
will render their plan impracticable."
The editorial, however, warns the Rus
sians to abjure from fatalistic beliefs.
Although written without the knowl
edge of General Stoessel's equally re
markable general order, issued at Port
"Arthur yesterday, the Novoc Vremya's
editorial comes as a . reinforcement of
the former's purport, that Port Arthur
must in no case be surrendered. Both
seem to foreshadow a siege of Port
Arthur and a bombardment, which, a
dispatch from Liaoyang says. It Is
rumored at Xewchwang will occur to
morrow.

SENIOR SENATOR FROM CAL
. IFORNIA IN* THE. NA
TIONAL LEGISLATURE.
WASHINGTON,' Feb. 29.â The archi
tectural changes made in the White
House was the subject of a large share
of to-day's discussion in the Senate
and thev were generally criticized as
falling far short of the improvements
which should have been secured with
the ' $500,000 appropriated for the' pur
pose. The discussion arose In connec
tion with consideration of the bill pro
viding for the erection of a building
for the joint use of the departments of
State, Justice and Commerce and La
bor. Consideration of the bill M r ao not
concluded.
Gallinger referred to the White
House changes, saying that the work
had' been in the hands of an architect
of great reputation. He said that aa
a result of his efforts a part ; of the
executive mansion had been spolied and
that the office of the President was an
eyesore and not fit to accommodate a
second-class lawyer or doctor. i"^
Dryden, who contended for liberal al
lowances-to architects, said he agreed
that the White House additions are not
of seemly appearance.' "But," he added,
"it- must be borne in mind that archi
tects are often placed at a disadvan
tage by the dictation of the employ
ers'."
NeWlands said thai the architect had
to decide whether to preserve the orig
inal character of the White House or
to^ alter the character of that building.
Bailey called attention to the- ne
cessity for an office building for the use
of Senators, saying' that the Senate an
nex was so unsafe that Senators were
not -allowed to carry books to their
rooms in that building. >;-"- >;
Newlands suggested that an annex to
the Senate be constructed like that to
the White House. .
Without completing consideration of
the bill, the Senate went into executive
session at 5:34 p. m., and at 5:29 p. m.
adjourned. â¢.,-_Â¦ -
WASHINGTON, Feb. 2^:âThe'Presi
denf to-day sent to the Senate the- fol
lowing nominations:
Chairman of â¢ the Isthmian Canal |
Commission â Rear Admiral John G. j
Walker, U. -S. A., retired. District of j
Columbia.- Members of Isthmian Canal ;
Commissionâ Major General George W. j
Davis, U. "S. .A., retired, District of ;
Columbia; AVIIliam H. Burr. New York; j
benjamin M. Harrod, 'Louisiana; Carl;
Edward Grunsky, California; Frank J. [
Hecker, .Michigan; William Barclay;
Parsons, New York. !
The commission, as constituted by the i
President, is essentially a body of en
gineers, sis of the seven members j
having distinguished themselves in en- !
glneeringworks. The law under whl<:h |
the commission was created provided j
that four of the members should be )
skilled in the science of engineering, i
Colonel Hecker is the only man on the j
commission who may be classed as|dis- J
tinctly a business man.- He is a man of
large affairs, and during the Spanish- j
American Avar served: the Government >
as director of transportation.
Rear Admiral Walker , has : be^n
Jde'ntined with this Government's In
vestigation of isthmian canal routes for
nnny years, and is regarded as the best
informed rrian in the country on that
subject. Arrangements already have
been made for an early visit to the
Isthmus of Panama by the commission.
It seems likely now that! the commis
sion, as a body, will go to Panama
within a - month. Preliminary work
will be begun Immediately.
The Senate, in executive session, re
ferred to the. Committee on IntÂ»roceanic
Canals the nominations for positions
on the Isthmian Canal Commission.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 29.â During
consideration of the District of Colum
bia appropriation b.ill in the House to
day Scott of Kansas made the declara
tion that a negro, had. dined at the
White House with President Cleveland
during the latlers first administra
tion. The Ftatcment- was prompted by
a reference toy jGilbert of Kentucky to
the dining of Booker T. " Washington
at the White Houfe.' When the name
watt demanded Scott said it was C.
H. J. Taylor, who was appointed by
President Cleveland a* Recorder of
Deeds for the District of Columbia.
Gilbert observed that he and others
never had heard of the incident^ but
the Democrats were not "particularly
claiming" Mr. Cleveland, and Cochran
Of Missouri said iP was but evidence
."that there is no better Republican in
the country than G rover Cleveland."
DalzeH of Pennsylvania, discussing
Canadian reciprocity, said he had been
unable to find in â¢ an exhaustive â¢ re
search a single argument which would
Justify the negotiation of a reciprocity
treaty between the United States and
Canada.
Levering of Massachusetts aroused
the minority' to applause when he de
clared that "while we are talking
about standing pat, the great ship of
business is drifting on the rocks, and
our bbasted prosperity is fast coming
to an end." â¢ .
Lovering prefaced ' this by saying
that of dollars: had been lost
to manufacturers : and . thousands of
laborers had been deprived of work be
cause the Government had not en
larged the drawback system. The rem
edy, he sa'id, was easy. The relief de
manded, he declared, could be secured
by a simple amendment to the draw
back feature of the administrative act
of the D-ingley law and this could be
done, he said, without interfering with
a single schedule or in any wise re
viewing the tariff.
Ho differed, he said, from Dalzell in
the matter of a demand for -new .mar
kets for goods of American manufac
ture. The manufacturers wanted an
outlet for their surplus output and the
demands for the new markets caused
them to realize that production had
passed beyond domestic "consumption.
He urged the South to increase the
output of cotton and sr:id immigration
was needed greatly in the South.
These things, he said, would aid ma
terially in solving: the race question.
The House at 4:15 p. m. adjourned
undl to-morrov.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 29.â It is a
mistake to imagine that an election
to Congress is all honor. The glamour
that hangs over Washington borrows
its enchantment from distance. A
near view and the most dignified and
stately Senator is found to be a pretty
hard; working man. The Senators have
their office hours and their hours for
attendance upon one or the other of a
half dozen committees; the afternoon
is spent in the Senate chamber and
the eveningâ what with its social obli
gations and the conferences and- the
people who insist upon an audience by
right of a residence in the same State
âit is by no means the Senator'8 own.
In fact, a Senator'8 life is a life .of
labor. The eminent ability that is re
quired to land a man in the United
States Senate must there be employed
to the utmost. To the vast amount
of work in .which the Senate takes the
initiative is added the other vast
amount that comes to It for review
from the larger body. Together they
entail an immense amount of study
ing and "research. And as for the most
part this . is conscientiously given,
the life of a Senator is considerably
mo're than one of mere dignity.
The work that he is called upon to
perform is of a twofold character.
There are the big and broad things,
the Panama treaties, the canal build
ing, the army, the navy, the harbors,
the interstate waterways, the recipro
cal trade relations with foreign coun
tries, the vast system of federal courts
and the still vaster system of the civil
service and the diplomatic and con
sular service Extending round the
worldâ the things distinctly national
Â¦that concern the people of the whole
country.
WORK OF A LEGISLATOR.
Then there are the things local and
that co'ncern fhe people of his own
State and more especially that part
of the State, the north or south, from
which* he hails, as distinguished from
the south or north, from which his
colleague comes. He is assailed every
day by a mail pouch full of petitions,
advice, complaints and plain requests.
Each 'of these must receive more or
less attention, though the letter writ-,
ing and other details which they de
mand may be entrusted largely to sec
retarieF.
Every Senator has a secretary and
the secretary one . to half a dozen
clerks and stenographers. And the
man who comes nearest to earning his
salary in Washington is the secretary
to a Senator. None but a man with
a clear head, good general information,
genius for detail and large capacity
for work need "apply for that job. He
is employed from morning until, very
frequently, late at night â he and his
assistants. The secretary to .the Sen
ator is often made the secretary to the
committee of which the Senator is
chairman. It is as member of a com
mittee, and especially as chairman,
that the Senator is effective. If is the
committee that has the first say as to
whether or not a bill "do pass." If
the committee to which it is referred â
they all go to the committee, of course
â does not report it back, the incident
is closed. ' But of the many that go In,
the fewâ that is the comparatively few â
that return may greet Faith and Char
ity with effusive familiarity, for their
name is Hope. There is something
radically wrong with them or their
champion if they do not stack up in
the law library.'
DUTIES TO CONSTITUENTS..
Therefore the committee of which
the Senator is a member is not only
the measure of the quantity but the.
quality of the service he is able to ren
der the country and his constituents
from his place in the stately building
on Capitol Hill.
An important chairmanship speaks
for the Senator in two ways. He is
recognized by the President of the
Senate as a man worthy to be'in
trusted with its responsibility. His
worthiness to be so intrusted is dem
onstrated in his having secured Â¦ the
honor, for these are prizes that are
contested for by strong men. There is
first, then, the Senator." Then there Is
his committee. The rule is not abso
lute, of course, but It is a rule that the
one offers a measure of the other. The
ultimate test Is as to what the other
does with the one. It is an indication
of* the character of work, often, to
which the Senator Js adapted or might
be expected to be adapted.
All this applies in some degree to the
members of the House. The member
of the House who Is in himself big is
smaller as an individual 1 because he is
member j of a larger body. Those of
them who take the Initiative and.hafe

Daniel on Negotiable Instruments.
Senator Daniel of Virginia is a dis
tinguished lawyer and author of one
of the standard law textbooksâ"Dan
iel on Negotiable Instruments." He
used to Â«ive lectures in a law school,
and one day he explained how he
came to write the book. He sa4d he
was in his office some years ago when
a man came in and asked him If
sight drafts carry three days of grace.
He didn't know. None of the other
lawyers knew, and it took a visit to
the bank to find out. He then deter
mined to write a comprehensive work
on all negotiable instruments, and he
did so. As the Senator was finishing
a young man in the class said: "Sen
ator, do sight drafts carry three days
of grace?" Daniel hemmed and
hawed, looked confused, and finally
said: "Upon my soul, young man. I
have forgotten." â New York Tribune.

SACRAMENTO, Feb. 29.â The Sacra

as Sacramento is concerned this fact is
of. merely .passing interest, for there

.' T.he~ back water -which- has. inundated
th% country south 'of the city limits' is
falling -steadily- The -water which has.
it's ultimate ..outlet into' the Mokelumne..
River, had been held in check by. a -nat
ural ridge northeast of .Freeppft, which
caused' a steady. Â¦' ris'e .between' t-haf
poiii.t and .'the Y.-s.treet levee". for, a cou
ple ''of. days.: This ridge has been -topped'
will'not go higher, i
The. water -which escaped through 'the
Edwards break reached the vicinity- of
New Hop.e yesterday and last.night be
came â¢troublesome. The flood- plane .of ':
the, Mokelumne was -already at " its
highost-and the'added water.' frorn' the -
Edwards bre.ak caused great alarm. â¢
â¢ A special- to; the -Bee; from. Walnut*
Grove; at rtoori states that the.-cro'ss-
levee ' on the Crawford-Clark ranch â¢
near" there went out at 2 o'clock .this
morning. This was due to the pressurd
of the- backwater from the Edwards
break. A Â¦ telephone -message from
Clarksburg eafly. this afterncon -stated
that Grand and Merritt islands' were"
all right and that the Lisbon district js
safe. The river at the location's named
was falling' and the' backv.f.ter from
the Yolo Basin is at a standstill.. â¢ . '
A special message to the Bee, from
Rio Vista, at noon -was to the effect
that the water in the river at that hour '
was an inch higher than it was during
the flood period of 1902, but the levees
in that locality were reported to be in
tact* Rain was falling at that place
and great uneasiness was felt lest' the
rain should be general throughout the
upper valley. ,

ANTIOCH, Feb. 29.â Sherman Islana
is withstanding the flood. There are,
however, two large cracks in the cross
levee on the upper division on Mayber
ry Slough, through which the water is
pouring. The levee between the cracks
has begun to settle and water is boiling
under it between the fissures. A force
of men is at work strengthening the
ievee with bags of sand. About 200
acres are under water. They are try
ing to get a dredger, and hope to have
one at.this danger point to-night. Mr.
Upham, one of the principal owners,
says that it looks pretty blue, but" he
hopes that the levees will hold out. To
day the water here was higher than it
has been for thirty-six years. The riv
ers are full of: floating debris. The
levees on the Tyler Island and Sargent
tracts have given way and the fertile
land presents the appearance of an in
land sea. '

"I took a young lady as a friend,"
said Love to-day, "when she was
homeless. I spent * large sums of
money on her and now she spurns me
after trying to . rob me of my money
and real estate. She promised to
marry me and I took her to San Fran

at least $5000 on her and deeded her a
house and lot. Then she got me to go
into the saloon business in San Fran

money for me." I scarcely can believe
that she would treat me so."

Student labor day is an institution
entirely original with the students of
the University of California. It was
founded eight years ago and was in
spired by the university's poor purse.
The treasury was empty and improve
ments were necessary. Some one sug
gested that the students do some neces
sary work themselves, and "the idea
soon took tangible form.
The students were organized and the
last three days of February set apart
for. laboring. There were not so many
students in those days, so it took all
of the three days. to! do the work. On
the last. 'day then a celebration was
held, just as to-day. '/
This evening a big celebration was
held in the Greek Theater. The the

the yells and songs of the students.
There were fireworks and speeches and
music and "stunts." Max Thelen,
president of ' the associated students,
presided, and J. E. Roadhouse, deputy
yell leader, directed the yelling iand
singing.
Dr. George F. Reinhardt of the class
of '97 told the multitude how the labor

students did in three days of hard
work. Professor Edmund O'Neill spoke
upon "The Significance of Labor Day,"

the air. Miss Elizabeth Arneill, com
ing in late with a case full of pies, was
surrounded by a swarm of the unap
peased and almost crushed in the
struggle for more pie. All of the pas
try was lost before it could be sent to
a safer place.
The luncheon came to a halt at last
for sheer lack of anything else to eat,
and then the students went back to
finish up the work so gallantly begun
j in the morning. At 5 o'clock the bugle
rang out again and the second student
labor day had come to an end.
RIG CELEBRATION. };*
The whole feast Â¦was-; the handiwork
of the women students themselves, who
assessed themselves 15 ! cents apiece to
buy the bread and flour and, coffee.
Hearst Hall's cooking range furnished
the heat and there the co-ed pastry
cooks toiled and toiled all morning'on
the pies, while the less experienced kept
two- hands . going on sandwiches and
lemonade, and beans.
.The feast over the workmen spent
what, remained of their hour of grace
in giving .went.. to, their college and
class yells. The "Oski wow wow", and
the "Give â¢ me ,the .pie", and other ; . fa
miliar "yells' were hurled back and forth
across , the courti "Little V Mini," ; thef
hero of last year's varsfty eleven, was
By. some oversight the supply of
gravel was allowed to run short this
afternoon and it was necessary to call
a recess until thirteen more loads could
be contracted for, the interval being
occupied by the students in running
races and doing other "stunts." Among
the diversions was the ducking of Rich
ard O'Connor, former editor of the
Daily . Californian, in the stream . of
Strawberry Creek, this punishment be
ing meted to him for playing "hookey"
for half a day and then appearing in
his Sunday clothes.
At noc-n, regardless of jumpers and
overalls and old clothes, the toilers
formed the lockstep and marched -to
the basket-ball court adjoining Hearst
Hall. There they were welcomed by
the co-ed contingent, marshaled by
Miss Margaret Henderson, chairman of
the women students' committee. The
pleasure of "passing out the feed" was
for all the women ' students, who had
gathered there 'in response to the call
of the president of the Associated Wo
men Students, Miss Martha Rice." The
committee of assistants consisted of
Miss Sarah McLean, Belle Cooled^e,
Edith HatfieM, Eva Gray, Nettie Haw
kins, Madue Cope, Bessie Forse, Na
talie Wdllenberg, Bessie Trowbfidge,
Alice, Phillips and Marlon Craig.
Sandwiches and pie and doughnuts
and tarts and coffee were served to
the hungry and clamorous from tables
spread in the middle of "the court.
Among these the students swarmed
and received their "hand outs" from
their co-ed friends. Wooden plates
served in, the place- of the more'gen^
teel kind and one tin spoon did duty
for coffee and pie alike.

In lieu of horses the students turned
themselves into steeds and dragged the

Fitzgerald explained that his pur

City Council without recommendation.

Then leading from this is a nqw
path that connects the high, road with
the Faculty Club. This path is sup
ported with stones that were dredged
from the bottom of the creek" and piled
up in the proper order. A long line of
workmen passed these stones along
from one to another out of the creek
until they reached their destination On
the road, where they were finally" fitted
into -place.
Over on the Hlllegass tract -there are
two new paths, both of them very nec
essary to the students ,who pass from
the main buildinga to Hearst , Hall and
the physiological laboratory/One leads
from the creek, bottom directly to
Hearst Hall and the other ls*a branch
from it to the laboratory. â¢}'
The gravel for all these paths, was
jput through a screening process" before
For ail the fuming and sweating and
grunting that was made there might
have been 12,000 workmen. At least,
that is the way it seemed to most of
the spectators. These men of much
brain and little brawn were spread out
in three or four groups and the ob
server might not go anywhere hardly
without running a gauntlet of pickmen.
â¢ There was any amount of "rough
housing" and rioting to give zest to
the employment, and the wonder is
that it did not all wind up in one of
those old-time "rushes" that the fac
ulty is so much set against: Every lit
tle while some student thieved away
with an emblem or Implement Â¦â¢ of a
rival college and made for the high
ground, .with the whole of the outraged
pack of rivals after him. Away they
*ould go, their work all forgotten, to
remain until the chase ended in victory
or defeat. A local merchant with an
eye to business sent many gal
lons of lemonade to wet the throats of
i the workers, but this met an awful
fate when the crowd made a rush for
it, most of it in the struggle going
down to swell the volume of Strawber
ry Creek.
But in spite of the rough housing and
inattention to strict duty something
,was accomplished. Twelve hundred
men can do a, lot in a day, even if some
of them do "soldier," and all that they
set out to do was done. For one thing/
there is a good, new path on the south
side of East Hall and the Chemistry
building, leading from the Botany
building to the College-avenue gate. It
is now five feet wide, inlaid with yel
low gravel and* fitted with gutters of
the proper depth.

Altogether the thing was more of a
success than the heads of affairs had
bargained for. There were predictions
that' it would all be more or less a
farce. Some estimated that there
would be more shirkers and skulkers
than shovelers and wheelbarrowers,
and bets were laid that the work would
have to be done all over again.
But nothing of the kind, for "when the
bugle sent its clear, glad tones across
the campus at o o'clock this morning
there \v*re more student- workmen on
hand than there were picks and shovels
for. The laborers outnumbered the im
plements, so that the bosses had to
make water carriers and horses and
more bosses out of the surplus. Even
the most conservative say that there
were 1200 men at work.

HIS Broadway; Feb. 29.
During the last session of the I>gislature
our organization had a bill Introduced requir
ing "all railways In this State to place two
brakemen on every passenger train consisting
of four cars or more. The railway companies
fought the bill and finally defeated it by a
small majority. But the Southern Pacific
promised to adopt the requirements of the bill,
even though It was not enacted a law, and
this promise haÂ» been keDt.
The Santa Fe. on the other hand, has mail*
no Improvement, and still pursues Its cheap
policy of plactnc' only one brakeman on. a
train, no matter what Its length. This man's
station Is at the rear of the train, and when
a stop occurs It Is his duty to run back along
the track to flag any trains coming from
that. direction. The negro porter is then left
as the only trainman In charge of the lives
of the passengers and the property of the
company. He is not an experienced brakeman.
has to pas* no examination and Is generally
wholly unfit to be entrusted with the duty cf
switching trains.
Yet this is Just what the negro porter waÂ«
required to do at Luzon station. The train
had- stopped and the brakeman had run back.
The porter was at the head of the train, near
the switch, which was closed to oncoming
trains. But he got rattled, being inexperienced,
and when the overland dashed down the track
he ' mistook the position of the switch and
suddenly threw It open Just as the cwlftly
moving" train came near. Had a. brakeman
been there, a man accustomed to this work and
familiar with the signals, the accident would
not have occurred.
The next Legislature should pass the bill
that was rejected last year, but before that
can be done the Santa Fe . Company should,
for ', Us own and - its . passengers' protection,
adopt the rule there laid down and put at
least two trained brakemen on all Its long
passenger trains.
Regarding the responsibility for the
collision V. Heck, chairman of the
legislative board of the Brotherhood
of Railway Engineers, yesterday de
clared that the accident was due to
the railway's policy In refusing to em
ploy a sufficient number of trained
brakemen. He said:
As the headlight of the oncoming
train fe.ll upon the waiting cars he
realized that he had made a terrible
mistake, but it was then too. late, and
in another moment the crash had
come. Taylor's statement that No.8
had always held the main line, allow
ing No t 3 to take the sidetrack, is
looked upon with doubt by local rail
road men. who say that incoming
trains are always given the right of
way over those bound eastward, and
the fact that Engineer Baker did not
slow up as he approached the switch
lends color to the theory that he was
accustomed to passing ithe eastbound
train on the main line without slowing
up to take the siding.
If the statement made by Taylor it
true â¢ and the passing orders were
changed, it was an act of criminal
carelessness to. send the porter-brake
man ahead to set the switch without
informing him of the change of or
ders. Taylor has- made a statement
to the officials of the road, but this
has not been made public and will not
be until the inquest, which will be held
the latter part of the week.
The funeral of Engineer Baker
will bo held at Point Richmond at 9
o'clock to-morrow morning. The ser
vices will be conducted by the Rev.
Dr. McDonald, pastor of the Presby
terian church at Point Richmond.
The funeral of Engineer Bennett
will be held at Stockton on Wednes
day.
The local officials of the Santa Fe
road were not disposed yesterday to
enter into a discussion of the train
wreck, explaining that they had not
yet received a full report of the affairs
from the officers In whose jurisdiction
the accident occurred. Said one of
the officials yesterday:
Jt is apparent to our minds that the colored
pdrter did what he thought was right, but
evidently his mind was rattled. Usually these
unfortunate accidents are easily traced to the
act of some excited Individual who cannot be
justly accused of carelessness. The experi
ence of the Santa Fe road with its colored
porters is that they have been faithful and
courteous servants, and there Is Â¦ no rule of
nature that would suggest that a colored man
is more carele?s than his white brother.
The porter that Is responsible for yester
day's accident Jumped at the last moment to
swing a switch that he thought was wrongly
set and he did not realize his mistake nntil
It was too late. A few years ago we bad a
case similar to this, where one of our most
faithful men sst a switch. While waiting for
the train to paÂ»s he fell asleep and dreamed,
in his nap that he had not performed the
duty that he had been accustomed to for
months Awakening suddenly and .hearing
the roar of the train near by, he Jumped to
the switch and swung it back and a few
peconds later he saw, to his horror, the train
ditched before. him.
Like all other transportation companies, the
Santa Fe endeavors to employ the most re
liable men and prides itself on the fact that
its judgment has seldom been at fault.
The responsibility for the wreck of
the two limited trains of the Santa
Fe at Luzon station, which caused the
death of Engineers L. L. Baker and
James Bennett and the serious Injury
of Fireman Edward Thomas, rests
upon Alvin Taylor, the colored porter,
upon whom the Santa Fe Company
had imposed the duties of head brake
man of the Chicago expreas, which po
sition, when the test came, he proved
woefully unable to fill. Taylor, who
has been arrested on the order of
Coroner Curry of Contra Costa County
pending: an Investigation of the wreck
and is now confined In the County Jail
at Martinez, made a statement to thÂ»
effect that he had misconstrued his
orders and had thrown No. 3 on to
the siding instead of letting it through
on the main line.
He eay's that he" was in the chair
car attending to the wants of the pas
sengers when No. 8 stopped at Luzon
switch to allow the westbound train
to pass and was called out to go ahead
and set the switch. . Taylor says that
the eastbound train had always kept
the main line when passing No. 3 and
that when he left the cars he did not
notice that his train was on the eid
.ing instead of on the main line, . and
that he went ahead and set the switch
to let No. 3 in on the siding as he had
always done before.

Amos K. Zeigler and Ung Ting Bow
must die on the scaffold, at San Quen
tin, according to decisions rendere'd by
the Suprenne Court yesterday. Of the
many arguments advanced in behalf
of each none was deemed of sufficient
importance to warrant a reversal.
Zeigler killed his wife with a butch
er knife in a peculiarly atrocious man
ner at Doyle's Gulch, Santa Cruz
County, on August. 6, 1900.' He was
tried, found guilty and sentenced to
life imprisonment at San Quentin. He
appealed and was granted a new trial
by the Supreme Court. At the second
trial Zeigler was given the death sen
tence and appealed again, but to no
avail. His defense was temporary in
sanity.
Ung Ting Bow killed a fellow coun
tryman in Kings County in a' high
binder war, an act which, under the
Supreme Court decision, diminishes
the "yellow peril" numerically by two.

Mont Pelee, which blew off ISO feet of
Its crown when It overwhelmed the city
of St. Pierre, has since been extruding
from Its crater at the rate of three to
five feet a day a shaft of lava 300 feet
In diameter, which now protrudes 800
feet above Us summit.
Our Idea is to hav* the men from California
work for the whole State at the expc?L
tton. That Is. we do not purpose that any
(hall quietly boom the!r own section of th"Â«
State at the expense of another and at all tlm*s
they will be expected to stand ready to defen<t
California against any detrimental statements
that may emanate from outside sources.
It Is part of the plan of the organization,
which was discussed at to-day's meeting, to
Impose fines upon any member of the California
delegation who Is found to bÂ« working In the
Interest of any particular section of the Stat*.
and a second offense of that character wilt re
sult In his being sent home. If the delegates)
find any one abusing San Franelsco or any
other county It will be tha duty of thn other
delegates to immediately unite In Its defense.
Unity of action la to be our motto, with â¢*
view to gaining for the entlrs State as much
advertising as possible, and we believa that
tho only wny to accomplish this is by creatlns
rules which will carry with them punishment
for their violators. Although tha coast coun
ties were not represented at to-day's meeting,
we hava received assurance that they will
join with tha valley counties In any agreement
that they decide on.

He further says that Hynes properly
qualified and based, his claim to the
office on a valid certificate of election.
"Hynes," says Judge Sloss, *"is enti
tled to the offlcÂ«} because of his better
apparent legal right. The law provides
that where there* is a contest over an
office the one making this showing
shall be declared the de facto officer."
/â¢Judge Sloss" opinion is a very short
one. .He does not go into the question
of- whether a Public Administrator
-s-hall .hold office for four years, ile
says, in referring to Hynes' -contention,
that Farnham had no rights In the
premises; that the. former Public Ad
ministrator, on January 8, gave up the
office and for a. week after Hynes took
possession did nothinjr that would in
dicate that he' intended contesting his
successor's claim.

The keenness of â¢ Attorney * Thomas
Hlckey won him a case in quick fash
ion before justice of' the Peace Daniels
the other day. He was the attorney
for the defendant in an action brought
by a man named Dodson. It was an
action to- recover 5100 on an alleged
cofttr.act. Dodson was", placed 'on the
stand and questioned by his attorney.
The plaintiff's answers practically null
ified hid suit and his attorney, tried
by Â£veryÂ» means in his power to pre
vent him from talking wildly. Hickey
smiled pleasantly during, the proceed
ings, and when Dodson's attorney said,
''That's pur ca'se, your Honor," Hlckey
jumped to his feet and said, "It's the
case for the defense also, your Honor."
"Jud.gm.ent for the defendant," said
Daniels,, much to the disgust of Dod
sonVwho could not see that by his own
volubility he had ruined his own case.

The- Seal' of War.
WE recently, noticed the report- of .tlie -Massa
chnsetts comm.ission against compulsory arbi
tration.' That, report covered aH of "the esseir
tiah points, and -seemed to exhaust the subject. Since
New Zealand has been so widely advertised as the lan-'d
of no strikes, because of her= compulsory arbitration- law,
theorists in this' country have been enthusiastic over the
plan. -They leave out of their calculations, two impor
tant elements, one affecting the employer and the other
the employe. . * .
In New Zealand the law soon became a matter o'f poli
tics. The.'vote of the employes far exceeds th'a.t of the
employers^' As a result the, decisions of the arbitration
officers,. who depend .upon -politics for their places, .fav
ored the greater number of voters. But it was found im
possible to compel employers to stay in business under
conditions that left them no inducement hi the shape of
profit. So there began, and continues, a â¢ disappearance
of the industries which employ labor. Â°As no law can
compel an", employer to dp business in- order to employ
labor at a wage scale arbitrated to his disadvantage, so
nothing can compel a laboring man to continue- work at
a scale -that is below what he believes .is a proper stand
ard of life". "The New -Zealand plan is an illustration of
the evil effects of a purely arbitrary and artificial inters
ference with the .natural law of supply and demand. Â° â¢
The bill* now before Congress, to provide a permanent
and costly tribunal for compulsory arbitration, has all- of
the pernicious features of the New Zealand plan. The
committee that has it in charge is consulting the' labor
union leaders .of the country, and their- answers are not
favorable to the proposed law. The principle cannot- be
tc*> often stated that in this country there is no power to
compel a tree man to work. When. by voluntary idleness
he incurs the penalty, visited upon vagrancy, -he legally
loses his status as a free man, and- the consequences are.
upon him. Â». " . '..â¢Â¦â¢
Our system docs not permit 'lie infliction' of "cpmpu.1*
so.ry labor or compulsory idleness. Â¦ Urid.er it no free
man can. legally be compelled to work nor to be idle. This
"would be an. interference with natural right, ..equal to -the.
holding of -men in slavery. We have explained before
that this is the reason which even vitiates-, a. labor, con
tract. . A workman may riiake a contfact.'as an individual,
and niay perform it as far- and aÂ£ long 'as suits him, and
no. -longer,- While" lie' performs it he must live up. -to' its'
conditions. His employer' can be 'compelled,. ;in like man
ner, to keep his part of. such a contract, only while it is;
Â¦i'n : -performance by the other party.- ..-.';... * â¢
â¢ The variations from this rule occur orilywhen property
is ill judicial- custody, or in the ca.Â«e of contracts on 'the
high seas, or in the public service. "When- the undertak
ing, is between cirizeh and citizen .its- performance .by the
laborer is voluntary. .Of course this, condition of" -legal,
respect for the rights of labor is associated with'th.e"free-
dom of labo.r. When the party to such- a' contract .teases,
to-.perfonri it, it is the right of the employer to";.'ftlthis
place, and.' anj'thmg which prevents' another ' man tak'iiig.

Taking men and politics as they are, such a result may
be confidently anticipated. In the superficial vjew- it- may
be said that the labor leaders should favor a : system
which throws . tlie disputes over wages arid ; ljoiirs into
palitics. which will in effect? make th-e wqrkingmen them
selves the arbitrators, ex p-arte, of all issiies-agairijst the
employers. It'dOes thorn much credit that they look up
on this as an apparent and .not. an 'actual advantage, Tje
cause no power exists to compel one man to employ an
other. When the pressure of practically ex parfc arbitral
tiou reaches* a certain point, capital, the employer, aban
dons the field and industry ceases. ' '*-*- s i . â¢ . .

Â¦ After' some apparent hesitation, but
with many a-n- anxious glance over _t*he
side df his rapidly settling vessel, the
Courser's captain agreed to pay J125*
and the tugboat's., hawser' was "made
fast.. Tke securing the big rope sealed
the bargain, and haTdly was it ar.ound
the Courser's forward bit when the
sailing vessel's skipper sang a out; .
"AH hands to the pumps and lively.
Dan, we're leaking like a .sieve." Go
like hell, and take me to' Mission flats,
where she can rest on the mud."
â¢ "Want a. tow, captain?" asked Dan
llaskell, who was in command of the
tug.
"Guess I'm' doing 1 all right as it is.
What'll you take me in for. Dan?"
Â¦ Since the 'day" When the first, tow
boat pulled a helpless vessel from dan
.ger to safety and charged handsomely
for the service towboat men and master
mariners have waged a war of wits.
The big .-ship's necessity has usually
been the tugboat's opportunity, and
none realized thi3 better than the ship's
commander,* whose only hope of secur
ing hel-p.at regular rates lay in con
cealing # the extent of his necessity.
The old shiD Courser, .whose hull is.
now doing duty as a coal hulk, once
sprang a leak on her way here from
a northern lumber' port. She was load
ed with redwood and could not sink,
but if she became water-logged the
chances were very much In favor of
her turning turtle, drowning all on
board and going to pieces. All hands
were kept at the pumps, and by dint
of constant labor the outrush of water
from the pumps more than kept .pace
with the flood which pouredMn through
an oDen seam. As the Courser ap
proached the Golden Gate a tugboat
was setn approaching. The sailors were
â¢worn, out and cguM not have kept up
the battle much longer.- The captain,
however, did not like the ideal of pay
ing *the emergency rate, to which the
towboat that saved his ship would be
justly entitled.
"Stop, pumping." he. ordered. "Get
your pipes, light them, lie down on the
beck load and take a smokt?. Keep your
mouths shut about the leak."

Lake Baikal is, -however-, a 'serious
Interruption .-.to " tJio. Trans-Siberian
Railroad, .and for the present greatly
aimimshes .its ' military value.' The
lake is 400 miles long and on th& aver
age thirty: mi tea wide. It. is surround
ed oh every side by -precipitous rrioun
tams several thousand feet in height,"
which are penetrated only by two or
three river- valleys coming .intp it from'
thÂ« - cast and. by a single gorge.throug-h
which the Angara River conducts its
waters into the plains- about. Irkutsk.
Such .is the contour, however, that
from the point where the*, railroad
reaches it .at the head of. the Angara'
River to .the" available terminus of
the railroad upon Ahe other side Is a
distance df fifty .miles, .which, the
ftteain t crrle* have to traverse to* make

.There .is. much discussion.- over -the
'military value of the Trans-Siberian
Railroad. The Japanese and -some .oth
ers take the view -that it is so Jong a
â¢line an,d so poorly- built that it will
not.be of milch worth in forwarding
troops and supplies. But this is a great
miftake. Though the read is. long and
a single track, the sidings are ample,
Â¦and the gauge is such thaf any amount
of rolling Mock -can 'be-, utilized upon
it'.from the' other Government â¢ roads.'
When traversing the road : ih -1900.-. at
th^-jtime- of .the -Boxer revolution, we
had ample opportunity to learn muclj
at first hand, of the capacity for- trans-,
porting troops, pay. aftnr day for sev
eral.-weeks, â¢ as we' loitered along, this
groat highway, we saw very regularly
tws/ -military* trains a .going .east
ward, each- carrying a "full regiment"
of l30fi men-, with a. fair, proportion of
'horses?* and military stores; and there-
Was no visible reason why there should
nc;t -have been twice that, number,, ex-'
cept that at- that time th'ere was only
one 'steam fÂ«rry-boat for transporting
trains across Lake Baikal^ But upon
that ferry-boat I have seen, thirty cars
at. one time' vith 1500 soldiers." The
boat, .however,, was able to make only
two trips a day.. But later a .second
boat of equal capacity was put- on| o so
that COCO soldiers a day could easily
be carried". across; -while In. the winter'.
When the lake is frozen over from Jan,-'
ua.ry to May, the track which .is laid
across will make the transit even eas
ier -than i'nsummer.
Everything: turns, therefore, upon
the facility with which- .the. "Russian?
can reach this fertile valley In south
ern Manchuria, so closely in the rear
of Korea. .But supposing that the
'Japanese should command the soa and
thus cut -on* access to the valley from
that side, it is still approachable by
a .well built railroad in the rear- which
not only comes all the way. from the
center of Russian power, but taps the
resources of the vast empire of East
ern Siberia, which is nat far away.
In much of the "speculation upon this
campaign the writers seem to forget
that there is a large population -of
.Cossacks, the most warlike, portion of
the llustsans,- already in Eastern Si
beria, so that the Russians have but
t<> mobilize the army In that portion
of the empire to more than double the
forces already in the field, for there
is already a Russian population of
nearly 2,000,000 in the provinces east
of Lake Baikal, of which men in mid
dle Jife w the predominant element
Among these there is nearly half a
million 'who are subject to' military'
duly, the r most of whom would take
to w'ar as na'turallv as did 'the 'Ameri
can pioneers in the time of the revo
lution. Xor is this railroad in '.any
special danger of being interrupted.
The only point at which it is possibly
accessible to Japanese invaders is nea.r
its terminus on the Jyiaotung Penin
sula, -while 200 miles of the Port Ar
thur end could he cut off, and' yet
leave the Russians in possession . of
their most important vantage ground
between Xewchwang an:d Mukden. .
Uirssia's 'northern' fortress on the Pa

supreme importance, and is more thor

Such rs the spirit with which- Americans meet disaster

Judge Sloss of the" Superior Court
: riaÂ»s granted the" injunction that was
asked. for. by Wetmore-.Hros. to restrain
the! -Board "0t- â¢'â¢St'ate Harbor CQnimiSr
sio.ners" from interfering ; with 'their'
â¢buTsi'nesj?;' uivderV the -Woodward Iaw7
which, was'eijacte.d* by "the- State "Legis
ia'tui'e to. prevent digcfrimi'nafion.in Uie
â¢buying =and seUing-'of perishable pro
ducts on the State's wharves- or other"
â¢ "property in- Sin Francisco.
Â¦ The. Harbor Go'mmisyioners, .after ii
liea.ring, took "away- from'' Wet'm'ore
Bros, their perrjiission" to do business"
-on the wharyes. ' .The' board also took
away" the permits that had been is
sued to- Scatena:.& Co., Wolf & Sons,
Itfc.Dpnough' & Runyon Â«ind five other
firms. 'Suits .in injunction were then
.brought against' the Harbor Commis
sioners, in which the four firms. that
are named in the foregoing were con- :
Â¦cerhed. It was" agreed- by counsel, as
the facts were the same in all cases,
that but- ope should be triedâ that of
Wetirlore. Bros, "-against the board.
'. JudgÂ» Sloss decided that "the pro
ceedings before- the Board of Haf bor
Commissioners on December 3, 1903,
were ineffectual to take, away the
rights of theplaintifC under the permit
held by it."
.This means that for the present at
least' all .the firms who have been de
.pxivod 6f. permits to sell perishable
products, .on the State's wharves in this
city will continue to- do business. What
action wijl be" taken 'by the Board of
State -Harbor' Commissioners, remains
tobe-seeh. â¢ Judge. Sloss in his decision
did not deal with the question of the
pow'er of. the Harbor Commissioners to
interfere with sales-. of perishable pro
ducts that take "place, off. .the property
of the State; The decision was .based
entirely; upon the defective nature, of
the proceedings conducted by the Har
bor.. â¢Commissioners' as a preliminary
to, taking- awuy the permits" from the
wholesale- houses that- deal in "perish
able products. I The notice Â¦ that "was
given preliminary to-'the hearing, was
found by Judge slo.ss not to be legal".
The-.-ciealfrs, he said, were entitled to. a
ppecifiq, notice' relating to.fionie- parv
,tlcular pffense;: but- none was given.

HISTORY OF CASE.
â¢ Judge Sloss, quoting further from
the law, saVs'that- in case; pf .violation
of the terms of a permit ; the holdeV
of such permit. would under the. law
forfeit the same "tipon a hearing" after
.due. notice to all parties concerned,"
The decision "deals principaHy withthe
question' whether" notice was given to
sdtisfy.- the legal requirements.'. .A re r
eital of ' the facts relative to the pro
ceedings before the Harbor Commis
sioners is the.n made as fojlows: :<Â¦*"Â£'!:-Â¦â¢
Pursuant to' the provisions- of this act, the
â¢ plaintiff, on" the Sth 'day of Maty, 11)03, applied
for and received a permit. On Decerrtber 4,
1003, the ILar'bqr Commissioners made an order
revoking and canctling the permit. "In tho
present action tl)<i plaintiff seek* an injunction
to restrain th?" defendant from interfering with
his sales and. bases his application upon the.
contention that the* plaintiff has never had the
notice or the hearing provided' for In this act,
and that .therefore the .attempted revocation
waa Illegal and void. ' ' . â¢ /'Â¦
It appears that on November 27, 1003,' tho.
defendant, caused to be served upon tho plain
tiff a notice directing- it to appear before- the
board on ThurFflay, 'December 3, at a stated
hour' and place fnr the purpose of investigat
ing the .alli-sett violation of the Woodward law.
On Nfvember.3ii and again on December 3 the
.plaintiff- In writing requested that the com
plainant should file specific charges pf the vlo
â¢la.tlon ccnfplalned ci, giving time, place and
circumstances.' and "that we shouVd be given
a copy of such charges, which we will b,e glail
to answer on twenty-four hours' notice." \
On- LK-cerribef u "the board proceeded, without
any other or further or more specific charge or
notice, to hear the, statements of the plaintiff
and others, and, after, hearing eald statement,
passed a resolution revoking tho plaintiff'* per:
init. â¢ â¢â¢** >''.-.- Â¦ Â¦
rOWEltS OF BOARD.
|Â» Judge Sloss next consider^ whether
the board had the power to order .the
revocation of .the permit to "Wefcmore
Bros. Gn this- point he says in sub
stance: . ". â¢ . .
The purpose of the- notice and hearing pro
vided for in '.the. act is to enable the- bolder
of a permit, whp is charged with a violation
of ..the agreement pursuant to which he holds
It, to appear before, the â¢ board, and" " defend
against jhe charge of -such violation 1 .- It Is
clear, further; ihat before one -aecuBed of.'vio
lation, of law can defend' against euch charge

I conclude, .therefore, that the proceedings
before the Board â¢ of Harbor Commissioners en.
r>ecember 3 were Ineffectual to take away the
rights of the plaintiff under the permit. -

Color of Hair Said tolndicate a Person's
â¢ â¢ Temperament.
". Â¦ Many â¢â¢ peopls believe that blonde, or
light hair denotes affection and dark hair
constancy. A person without hair is not
devoid of character: far from it. The
disppsition .of the " average bald-headed
man is to show such solicitude for the
welfare of others that he negrlects him-
self. A germcauses baldness. . Prof. Sa-
bouraud of Paris, France. , Inoculated a
rabbit with dandruff germs, causing it to
become totally bald in^flve. weeks-' time.
To rid the scalp of these dangerous
perms it is necessary to apply Newbro's
Herpicide.
"Destroy the; causeâ you remove tha
effect." .-

The unsettled weather and the breaking up
of the country roads that will . follow caused
considerable commission-house buying of corn
early in the seFsion, and the market was firm
in view of the weakness In wheat. -Tha,mar

eevere decline in wheat! prices and 'the profit
taking due to that weakness. - The selling was
mainly by longs. . The May. option . showed
greater firmness. than July owing to .the scarc

CHICAGO, Feb. 2Â»: â Under an a\'alanche of
commlsslflri-houFe selling, w.hlch" set in shortly
after the vop'enlng -to-day, -fhe whe'at market
went . to" pieces, extreme- weakness prevailing
tho greater part of the day. The opening on
Ma*' .was *fcc .higher to 2*ic lower at $1 01*4*
to |l'03fi.. July was unchanged to %c lower
at OCVic to Â»6"ic.' Around $1 O2Â»4*.the May
option hehi steady -for a time on' a /air com
mlssfcn-house dem.tnd, .but there was great

as the general Inclination .was to sell: The
If adln~ long had May for 'gale. The impres

he had practically closed out his doal in May
wheat. With the big operator out- of the mar
ket for "this, delivery, smaller holders became
urgent sellers. Commission-houses also Joined
in' the movement. ' For a time it looked as If
there was no bottom -to -the slough. Into which
the market had fallen. From around $1 02
May dropped eunddenly-to 09% c, a loss of prte
cisely 4c from- the high point of the day. July
wheat went down to 03%c, or 3%c below the
toi> figure. There was fome buying of July
by the big trader, who had apparently Just
closed out his May line. . Shorts also bought
moderately, the result being a partial recovery
In prices. The close was fairly steady at the
decline, with May at (1 01. July closed at

A sensational break occurred in pork under
liberal liquidation. . Heavy Belling! by. packers
and a lack of support caused a loss of $1 05
in tke price of May pork. The weakness in
pork spread to lard and ribs, but j those
products showed only moderate declines. Trad
lng was active and the volume of business was
larse.. Liberal receipts of hogs" and lower
prices at the yards, were factors In closing the
heavy selling orders'. There was a good com
mission-house demand on the decline- and a
fair recovery was made. , The opening on May
pork was <3own.l2V4c to 32%c at $15 80 to $16

The lot of the visiting comic opera
company in town- here Is not the hap
piest one. . Nor wiH such performances
as the Tivoli gave last nfght make 'it
any easier. Much was promised by the
management for the new : comlc opera
regime with, the opening of-, the new
house! Much was performed last night
In the production of "The .. Gypsy
Baron," given In accordance with .the
promise of the management to revive
some of the classics of light opera.. The
house has spread itself on the produc
tion. Signor Russo, who reappears .as
the gypsy baron, is probably the most
expensive thing there, but the cast has
stars "to burn." And the chorusâLil
lian Russell, fresh from Gotham show
girl visitations, might well praise this
young and vocal band. Pretty It Is,
too,- 'graceful and alert, '. and -we are
gratefully yours for it. Director Stein
dorff.' â¢ â¢
SIgnor Busso's welcome was of the
6bstrepe.rpus sort. The large audience
was peppered with' his friends, who
held up the. opera for several seconds
â¢to greet the little tenor.
There seemed to be, in fact. Â¦ the
sneaking hope of a speech in SIgnor'
Russojs brand-new English, . He, how
ever, declined, but hurdled over a very'
Italian high C with evident gratitude.
As mav be imagined, he fits excellent-
ly well Into light opera.â the pity oh't
is that it Is not lighter, libretto-ward.
He* has the right mercurial grip, the
spirit and shape and lightness and
fun essential to the business. .And
Sigrior Russo's English would serve a,
fuller turn than Strauss permits. He
still "lofes' you," but'th'e tongue is evi
dently not made in Germany. It -" is
perhaps- superfluous to mention that
Russo's singing is a delight.
The comedians have less of a chance.
Hartman has a good part as Keltrier,
the swine owner. He 'is ausge-noble
in the role. Webb makes the most of
the part of Count Homonay,. and Ar
thur Cunningham of the Count Camerb
role. But the Strauss librettist was
chary of his fun. : wherein Jies the
weakness" of most of' his operas. Luck
ily there is much else to compensate.
The music, with Its prevailing: Hun
garian color, fine trios, stunning cho
ruses, is amply .charming. To Caro
Roma, who, as the gypsy girl SafflVsang
delightfully, the production owes
much. The role suits her admirably
vocally, and she did sing: A pleasing
surprise was afforded by' Nettie Deg
low's Czlpra, an old gypsy hag. Miss
Deglow's make-up was exceptionally
clever, arid her acting highly promis
ing. She has a voice., too. and is learn
ing rapidly how to use it. Annie Mey
ej-s sings pleasantly the Arsena part,
and Bessie Tannehill is useful as Mifa
bella. The Tivoli has. outdone itself in
â¢ settings and costumes. . ..

Ib the man "held for observation" at

G. Meyers or Rev. W. S. Eldredge? Is
he shamming or has he really slipped a
cog mentaliy? Has he actually, forgot
ten-his name and his past. or. is his
declaration of a blank in his memory
mere feigning? These are questions
which the Insanity Commissioners are.
trying somewhat blindly to solve. The
case Is one of the most perplexing that
has recently come under their notice.
The man came to the Emergency
Hospital last Wednesday afternoon,
saying that a little while before as he
was stepping off a car at Turk and
Devisadero streets something In his
brain went wrong and he suddenly
found himself unable to remember who
he was or to recall anything as to his
antecedents. He had a memorandum
book and an Episcopal prayer book. In
his pockets, but these gave no positive
Identificatioh. .One of them contained
the name "John D. Meyers." and he
said; he. thouglit this, might be his
.name, AmorighlS' few possessions was

Eplscppal Clergyman Â¦ .residing at 85

called on the patient. at the hospital
neither was able to remember the other.

SUSPECTED OF FEIGNING
OPERA WELL RENDERED
The Supervisor* last night by a vote
of 10 to 8 fixed the gas rate for the
next fiscal year at 90 cents a thousand
cubic feet, as against $1 20 for the year
Just closing. This decision was arrived
ai after deliberations extending over
several days, during which time a mass
of evidence was. taken and. the records
encumbered with figures in which mil
lions were as plentiful as flowers in
spring.
The meeting yesterday morning was
thrown open to any that might wish to
make complaints, but only two , pro
testants appeared. One of these claimed
his bills are higher now than they were
when gas was sold at $2 a thousand.
The other was a woman who keeps an
apartment-house and considered her
bill exorbitant. None of the improve
ment clubs were represented.
This" rate of 90 cents is the lowest
ever fixed In San Francisco. Regarding
the rate President Bourn of the San
Francisco Gas and Electric Company,
addressing the Supervisors, said:
I wish to do nothing but call attention to
the figures already given. The rates of the
Equitable, have been quoted, and we can enow
that we actually make it cheaper than the
Equitable did. as the figures quoted for it
were unfair, as they were only for one month.
We have kept all the promises we have made
and reduced the rrlce below the maximum
Placed l>y you There has been consldcrablc
talk of people telng dissatisfied. \ou met
this morning to hear the complainants and
what, was the result? Two people came before
you and said that their bills were too High.
This we consider a good shpwlng. .
WAISTS TU E OLD RATE.
I ask you that the rate be flxed at $1 20.
that we may be able to give a fair return to.
our stockholders. . .'/'';
The company is selling gas at fl at pres
ent chiefly to- get the Rood will of the peo
ple' and Increase the consumption of. gas. .If
the consumption is increased Â¦â¢ sufficiently wp
will be satisfied with a$lrate. Of course it
is to our advantage to do this, as we wish
to keep out competition., "^d we would re
duce the. rate to SO cents, if possible, to keep
out competition.' Â» â¢ â¢ 'Â¦ '
On being questioned by Mayor
Schmitz,. Mr. Bourn said. that at pres
ent, while the maximum rate is $1, ow
ing to certain old contracts the aver
age is 91 cents. At this rate the com
pany is making a profit,' but this, he
claims, .is a -showing due chiefly to
bookkeeping, as. th.e depreciation ac
count had not been charged up. Gas.
he said; cannot profitably be sold for
less than 51.' and at least 2Vfc per cent
Should be set aside for depreciation.
As regarded competition, Mr. Bourn
said the Independent Company, could
hardly have been considered a fair com
petitor, .Â£s it entered the field not so
much to make, money as to impro%'e
ttie service. This, he said, it certainlj:
did, and the head of the company has
greafiy benefited the public. He dc-es
not under present, conditions consider,
it possible for a competitor to enter the
field and make money.
Attorney Samuel Knight for the com
pany said:. - * '..' Â¦ â¢
â¢We consider â¢ the present rates of the com
par.y should -ba . sustained. It has never been
th* policy of. the company to charge the traffic
all It would, bear. As A matter of fact, we
have not chaired the fufl -maximum and will
not do so In the future, provided the consump
tion keeps up as It has been apd the cost of
labor and other supplies are not Increased. V
the anticipate* raise in the cost Â«f oil. coal
and cok-e iakr>. place and the concessions to.
workmen- are. jrranled add a proper depreciation

increased 10- cents on the thousand feet: -

Shortly after midnight the Water
Committee of the Board ctf Supervisors
presented its report, which was adopt
ed after "a brief discussion.
The adoption of the report will make
practically no difference to the rate
payers of the city, for, with the excep
tion of changing the hydrant rate' from
$2 to $1. it re-enacts the ordinance
adopted a year' ago. This ordinance
was never enforced, as the company
objected to it, took the matter into the
courts and no decision regarding it has
as yet been rendered. Irt the mean
while the company, by agreement, has
been collecting, on the rate fixed In.
1902. "
Supervisor Comte alone 1 objected to
the adoption of the ordinance and of
fcredas a substitute the 1.902 ordinance,
under which rates are now being col
lected.. His amendment was defeated
by a vote of 17 to 1.
Supervisor d'Ancona said the report
of the committee was based on the val
uation of the plant made by the City
Engineer, with" a reasonable allowance
for taxes, operating expenses and in
terest on the money invested. Braun
hart also favored the proposed ordi
nance and it was finally passed to
print.
KELLOGG MAKES PLEA.
At the afternoon session of the Su
pervisors, sitting as committee of the
whole. Attorney Kellogg, representing
the water company,- made a plea, that
the rate established in 1902 be retained
at .least until a decisioa is given by the
United States Circuit Court on the dis
puted rate fixed in 1903. He said in
part: . : . .
"During this investigation some seri
ous inquiries have been made regarding
the capabilities of the Spring Valley
Water Works.' It has been stated. that
the company was near the limit of its
output, and I wish to brand this at the
outset as a misstatement, as the com
pany has planned ahead, and at the
normal rate of # growth the present
plant will be sufficient to supply the
city seventy-five years hence."
He then read a : statement regarding
the supply, in the various watersheds,
which showed that the company could
supply <a city of 2.000,000 inhabitants.
Coming to the niatter of rates, Â¦ Mr.
Kellogg said it would be only fair to
again fix upon the compromise rate
of 1902, which is now . in force, as It
was based on a valuation made by the
Cit>Â» Engineer smaller than that of the
present year.
INCREASED COSTS. â¢
In fixing the rate according to the
valuation of property he requested that
cognizance be taken of the fact that
the cost of labor has increased 50 per
cent and labor is one of the largest
items of operating expenses. The cost
of redwood lumber .also had advanced
100 per cent and large quantities of
this must be purchased to construct
and repair flumes. â¢'
â¢ Kellogg criticized the report of En
gineer Dunn, who, he claimed, did not
figure, on. a sufficient acreage at the
reservoirs and catch" basins to prevent
the. water from contamination.
