Nevertheless, there is warrant for tha
statement that the Japanese are not
as implacable as they appear, and from
a conversation had to-night the distinct
impression was gathered that they
would scale their money demand ; and
use another '"formula." which would btÂ»
acceptable to Russia.
It is believed the Japanese Intend to
let the conference end to-morrow.^BHgl
On the ' Russian aide all pretense of
claiming' that Mr. de Wltte *la any
longer is abandoned. He
has gone to the furthermost limit of his
imperial master's orders. More, he can
not j do." sincerely as he _ personally . may
desire to.' bring the nefftioatlons to ; a
successful conclusion. His position Is
a difficult and -^peculiar one. He is a
statesman of ; large ambition. Liberal
at heart, he Is as yet a; servant of hla
sovereign. At the present Juncture h,ia
role 13 described as like .that of Mlra
beau.' He stands between," the King
and his people. He obeys the sover-;
eign. but he wants his people to know
where theÂ«responsibllity for the fate of
the negotiations must â¢ rest.' At "' the
same time he ?T:annot himself take a
firm stand ; "against his ; sovereign. " For
this reason, and the,authenticated hl3- :
tory -of this conference will *, bear out
this 3tatement,he preferred, .when first
appealed to :by Mr. RoosevelC to^ have
the'lattef go-s traight to -the
with his suggestion. Though perhaps
in full cympathy, with" President Roose
velt, "to have himself appear In sup
port of It too ardently or-to have open
ly Indorsed it; against his Instructions,
might, considering the lnfiuencea about
the court which are personally hostile
â¢' Press "dispatches from Tokio and: St.
Petersburg are read with the utmost
interest here. Indicate an unchangeable
attitude on the part of both Govern
ments. Yet both are anxious for peace,
it is said.
Probably not more than $200,000,000
stands in the way. Yet the Japanese
clin? doggedly to their demands. Their
people at home insist upon it.
The most competent Japanese , au
thority, who did not conceal his pessim
ism, \when asked to-night whetner for
the saka ?of peace Japan would yield
further, replied:
"Read the dispatches from Tokio and
draw your own conclusions."
; PORTSMOUTH, N. H., Aug. 25. Tr XhÂ«
peace conference to-night seems head
ed straight for the rocks. Despite the
fact that every question of principle
Involved In the quarrel between the
two countries has. been settled In favor
of the victor and that apparently only
."words and money" still separata
them, the negotiations seem on the
verye of a final rupture. The air waa
filled to-night with gloomy forebodings,
as superficially everything Indicated
that io-morrow's session of ' the con
ference will prove the seance d'adieu.
In the most positive fashion it is de
clared-that no instructions had reached
Air. d<? "Wltte .up to this evening which
would permit . him to entertain the
compromise proposals submitted by
Baron Koxnura and therefore unless.
Japan has a new proposal to make to
morrow all that seems to remain Is for
the envoys to meet, sign a declaration
that the conference na.3 completed its
labors, shake hands and part.
But there ara still ununown factors
in the case which mi^ht change
the situation. The result, of President
Roosevelt's second appeal direct to the
Czar has not transpired and the result
of the pressure on Japan to alter the
form. of her proposal by the elimina
tion of the purchase price of the north
ern'half of Sughalien is not known.-"

WASHINGTON. Aug. 25.â 1n both the
army and the navy the feeling is growing
that the {only way to put an end to the
present large number of desertions of sol
diers and sailors is for the public uni
formly to ostracize the men who have
taken French leave . before completing
their terms of enlistment. Colonel Will
iam T. Duggan, First United States In
fantry, commanding the Department of
the Lakes at Chicago, has reported to
the War Depaitriient that there were 393
disertions in that department during the
year just ended. He says: "Desertions
will continue cs long as public sentiment
favors tJ:e deserter."
The dtsertions in the navy, despite ef
forts to give the men gTeater liberty, still
average from 10 to 13 per cent of en
libtcd personnel. The beet thought of
naval officers in high posts is to over
come this tendency and especially in the
North Atlantic fleet are efforts exerted to
make sailors csnttnt. It is said that in
England desertion constitutes a less
troublesome factor of the naval policy
for the reason that public stntiment is
heartily opposed to recognizing on a
basis of civuity or equality any man de
serting from his Majesty's ' service.
American naval officers say that desert
ers find in this country a credulous public,
ready to listen to and sympathize with the
bluejacket who excuses his desertion on
the false plea 'mat the hardships in' the
navy are more than a man can long en
dure

Action- was taken to-day at a meet
ing of the State Boarb of Health to
enable the Federal authorities to put a
stop to indiscriminate travel between
infected points and New Orleans. The
resolution adopted is general in char
acter and authorizes any local health
otticers of infected localities to prohibit,
the introduction Into their communities
or persons acclimated, unacclimated or
said to be immune, when in their judg
ment such introduction would add to
or increase the prevalence of the dis
ease. Persons known to reside reg
ularly in an Infected locality in Louis
iana are to be admitted into their
homes when they furnish satisfactory
proof of residence*.
The yellow fever situation to-day
was regarded as having undergone no
: change. Dr. White's announcement
that if the people will faithfully screen
and disinfect and obey the regulations
which have been made and if all efforts
continued as at present to- remove cases
promptly it is possible that there will
be an entire cessation of the infection
within the next thirty days has spread
a most hopeful feeling throughout the
community.. :'â¢\u25a0\u25a0â¢\u25a0
Dr. J. N. Thomas, in charge of the
quarantine station at the mouth of the
Mississippi River, made a report to the
State Board of ' Health to-day. Dr.
Thomas said: . . . â¢
"Fruit trade with Colon should be
prohibited. If It is stopped^ yellow
fever can be more easily prevented
from landing on the Southern coasts.
Colon has always been a dangerous
point." â¢
to and pealous of him, have injured
instead of bettering the chances.
MAY BE UP TO WITTE. '
When the President's first effort fall
-ed he^dld not discourage, a second at
tempt in such a way that the Emperor
would have .difficulty In declining, out
of courtesy ' to the President, to em
power : : Mr. '\u25a0 Witte -at least \u25a0'" tenta
tively to proceed with the negotiations
and see 5 if a satisfactory basis -could
not be arranged, reserving; the-last
word to himself. Should such author
ity come at the. eleventh" "hour Mr.
Witte might make the "best .terms he
coulid and then figuratively throw; ' a
treaty at the Emperor's feet to . take
or leave, yes or no. As a politician, Mr.
Witte did not relish the Idea having it
said when he, returned to Russia that he
had made a "bad peace." lie might pre
fer the Emperor to shoulder, that .'re
sponsibility, j But shortly "before mid
night Mr. Witte gave absolutely no en
couragement to the idea that thero
would be a change of heart at -St
Petersburg. Unless Tokio was ready i
to recede further he expressed the opin-.
ion that all was over. He said:
NO MESSAGE RECEIVED.'.
"I have received .no telegram from
St. Petersburg which changes the sit
uation. Indeed. I do not expect: any.
I have not asked instruoiions. so that
I cannot receive any. If to-morrow
there is to be v change it must como
from the Japanese side.""-
This would seem to indicate that the=
President's second effort had failed at
St. Petersburg.- What, if anything, ha
has been able to do at Tokio through
his Interview with Baron Kaneko this
afternoon still remains a mystery.
That the last word has not come from
Tokio and that Baron Komura may still
appear in a conciliatory role to-morrow
may possibly be inferred from the fol
lowing fact: : :
The time for the sitting of the con
ference to-moirow was, not. set when
.the adjournment was taken on Wednes
day. \u25a0 â¢This evening ' Mr. Witte noti
fied . the Japanese mission that he was
ready to meet .It .in .. the' morn- j
ing at 9:30 o'clock. The Jap
anese, 'â¢ after.- consultation, -demurred,
on the ground that the minutes of the
last meeting would not be ready in time.
Therefore, at their ' reauest; the meet
ing was set for 3 o'clock In the after
noon. Information - received at a late
hour indicates that' President Roose
velt's efforts are not exhausted; ;that he
is still in communication * with Tokio
and St. Petersburg. To-morrow's meet
ing consequently Is likely not to provÂ«
decisive. -\ -\u25a0 ' '"
At midnight no message Â«iad reached
Mr. Witte from the President.' â¢ and
it was regarded as \u25a0 practically certain
that an adjournment' would be taken to
morrow-'iintir r Monday. 1 :; â¢-' '

NEW YORK. Aug. 25.â A story
strange as that constituting- a- plot of
any novel will be told to Governor Hig :
gins of New York by^ a lawyer when
he endeavors to secure the pardon of a
man who chose to serve a* sentence ot
three yearsMmprlsonment In Sing Sing
prison for the crime of -which lie' was
Innocent to shield the name of a woman
from scandal. _ <
Carl Fisher-Hansen, the lawyer, said
to-day that he would at once', appeal
for, the pardon of. the prisoner, whose
name he would not reveal, at the re
quest of .the 'woman' whose reputation
the prisoner had saved at the expense
of his own liberty. The woman, Fish
er-Hansen says, had ', visited his ! office
within ;a few; days and;' said that her,
husband had just died and that she
now. wanted to do justice to the pris
oner. .They had ; been friends and, more
than a year j ago, > when her husband
returned ; unexpectedly,' -he caught " the
other running away. To save her from
scandal the man confessed that " he bad
broken , Into her home to steal, where-"
upon ' he â¢ was arrested and - is now Am

The ; prisoner was a young college
student. who disappeared from one of
the colleges when i he' was arrested.
"I will not ' say whether \u25a0it was \u25a0 Har

Outlining their belief as to the best pol
icy to pursue In fixing the blame for the
scandals, the directors say first that the
blame for alleged cases of misconduct
will be found to rest on individual of
licers. and not upon the directors as a
body. Having made this explanation, the
answer then admits in a general way the
\u25a0wrongdoing charged.
The first charge specifically answered
is that premises on Broadway were let at
inadequate rentals to the Mercantile Safe
Deposit Company. This Is admitted, but
it is denied at the time this lease was
made James H. Hyde, J. \V. Alexander,
Gage 1-:. Tarbell. V. P. Suyder, Thomas
D. Jordan, Charles B. Alexander, H. R.
Winthrop. A. \V. Krech and William IL
Mclntyre were stockholders and directors
in the Mercantile Company. With certain
icservations. admission is then made that
the capital stock of the Mercantile Safe
Deposit Company was acquired by the
Equitable, which paid $230 per share "for
shares of a par value of $100. The reser
vations in favor of the Equitable in con
nection with this charge include a claim
that these allegations are true In respect
to certain of the Equitable officials, but
â¢ that the alleged purchases were never
known to the whole board of directors.
The directors admit that the officers
who permitted wasteful, improvident
and improper advances of money to
agents may have been guilty of grave
errors of judgment, but assert that they
have no information sufficient to form
a belief that these officers were know
ingly guilty of such improper acts.
IMPROPER SALARIES.
The table of alleged improper sal
.aries to Equitable officers, which was
V.mbodied in the State's charges. Is de
cared to be a true statement of the
ligures.
Admissions of greater latitude are
made on the subject of pensions and
to the charges that money under the
g-uise of fees was received by directors
and stockholders, who were, also offi
cers of the Equitable and other cor
porations.
Taking- up the $685,000 loan of. the
Mercantile Trust Company. a.n admis
sion of Its existence is made, but the
directors deny that they improperly
permitted this transaction.
The $250,000 loan to the Depew Im
provement Company is next admitted,
with a proviso which states that this
admission Is restricted to "those of the
Individual defendants who were or
ought to have been cognizant of these
transactions."
The charges of the existence of ex
cessive deposits in the National Bank
of Commerce of New York and at least
nineteen other banks are admitted.
The $10,000,000 surplus held by the
Equitable Society Is the final item con-
Fidered by the directors and In sub
ptance their reply on this charge is
that they do not know precisely what
their rights are regarding the surplus
and that they are willing to leave this
matter for the courts to decide.
INDIVIDUALS TO BLAME.
NEW YORK. Aug. 25.â The .Equitable
Life Assurance Society to-day joined with
the State of New York In asking for a
full investigation in court of its director*
and officers, and their alleged wrong
doings in managing the moneys of the
society. The document which announced
this determination was the answer of the
forty-nine Equitable directors to the
charges against them by the State. Ad
mission is made that the Equitable had
been guilty of improper acts. Among
these answers they admit the 5-50,000 loan
to the Depew Improvement Company.
They admit the 5655.000 'loan of 'the Mer
cantile Trust Company, but waive re
sponsibility in this loan so fax as the
board of directors is concerned, and in
dicate Messrs. Alexander, Jordan and
Deming as the persons having the most
Intimate knowledge of these transactions.
The charge that excessive salaries were
paid to officers of the society is not di
rectly answered, but admission is made
that under guise of salaries excessive -fees
were gfven to certain officials, who were
also directors in other companies.
In defense the answer states that these
practices were not known to the whole
board of directors.
Claim That Blame for Mis
conduct Rests on Indi
vidual Officers.
The Isthmus of Panama, by forming & bar
rier between the Atlantic ana Pacific oceans,
has saved South Asia from the contagion 01
yellow fever. When the Panama canal is cut
you will probably find that it will intoduce y:U
low fever Into Asia. The effect of this on the
commerce of San Francisco is ikely to be ee
rlous. You will find that a yellow fever tea re
will be worse than a bubonic plague scare.
There Is nothing so fatai 10 commerce as a
quarantine, and quarantines are likely to be
frequent if the yellow fever bogle is not laid.
Quarantines should never exist. They have
none in England. The last great pandemic of
cholera anw to America, but it did not affect
England in epidemic form, although a few
cases were introduced there. There were' no
quarantines, but there Â«v an elaborate sys
tem of health Inspection wnlch led to the iso
lation of suspected cases. All cases were re
ported and at once dealt with. Ac nobody was
*eriou*ly Inconvenienced, there was no tempta
tion to conceal 'disease. The same method
should be adopted here, so that when a case ot
contagious disease drops into port it can be
promptly : Isolated. I -understand you had Chi
natown quarantined and roped off. It .was a
futile ''expedient." No rat land .rats are the
principal carriers of bubonic plague) would care
twopence whether he crawled out over a rope
or undir one. " â¢ .
. You have quarantines against whisky tn'tbis
country, yet - they are jrequently run with
great Buccess. Any quarantine can be run if
some unprincipled fellow with no ' regard for
law is determined to do it.. The only quaran
tine people should have is to get their houses
in proper order, and maintain regulations for
keeping them In good condition.
RECOMMENDS A SCHOOI*.
There is no question as to' the necessity, for
a school of tropical medicine in the United
States. I presume that the standard of medi
cal education In this country Is not much dif
ferent from the standard in England and I
know that an ordinary physician there fresh
from a regular medical school knows nothing
of the diagnosis and treatment of tropical dis
eases. To put him in a lonely place in the
tropics and make him responsible for the lives
of a few dozen white men and hundreds of .
nativefs is murder.
. What I saw in China and other places has
led me to take, up this subject and see ..what
could be; accomplished, and .they are quite
unanimous in England now as to the desira
bility of the. movement. â¢ . - .'-\u25a0
.You will find the United States to-day well
represented medically throughout the British
and the American tropical dependencies. ; Very
\u25a0few. young < physicians : are \u25a0 competent to take
charge of bodies of men in tropical countries.
It is too much to expect of a medical man
without a special education. I would as soon
send a tinsmith to put up a steel bridge or a
northern farmer accustomed to growing tur
nips and other green ctods to, grow, cotton ma
a tropical country as to send a northern doctor
without special study to; treat tropical disease.
There are two school* of tropical medicine
In England; one in London 'and one at TLlver
j pool. The one at London was assisted by the
Government. . The' one at Liverpool was estab
lished through the. local patriotism of /the
merchant* and business men of the : place. \u25a0 I
should . think that here the proper proceeding
would be for* some : wealthy; m*n ' of â¢. the State
or town to undertake this matter.' The Mer
chants'" Association .might take it up. If it
succeeded it would soon be able to stand ' on
Its own feet.'
PLE.\TV OF -SUBJECTS HERE.
The opportunity ln~Â£an- Francisco Is unique.
It is -far 'better/ than that of London. : There
is a local Chinese colony hqre of about 10.000,
I understand, which should be able to supply a
large uumbtr of.c ases for ; teaching purposes*.
You have plenty, of "Japanese. . Filipinos. Ha
uallans and other tropical . peoples, and you
could - draw., upon them/ . Then . you , already
have schools and hospital!) established and ' all
that ; would, be needed In. addition' is a. certain
amount ' of organization, rxpanelon ' In \u25a0 th* hos
pitals \u25a0 and : endowments for ; teachers " and "- ydu
have your : school made..' /. ;-- : \u25a0 -\u25a0-.--. '.\u25a0. \u25a0 \u25a0\u25a0 â¢
: -A treat deal ; . has f been * said : about \u25a0 studying
dif cases where they ariae, but -the . tropics,
where ' thÂ» framing heat -\ knocks 'the' energy
out of â¢ Europeans â¢ and where you â¢ feel inclined
to sleep : every hour of the day; and can't ' look
dowt microscope ' wlthout-sa' drop of swrat
obscuring the eyepiece.: Is; no 'placefor 'study.
The - place > to : learn â¢ tropical ; medicine \u25a0 is ; in a
cool climate like this. - Climate," clinical s op
portunities and organized schools '.combiner to
make San ; Francisco the best Â» place.- or one of
the best places, 1 -in the world for : this feort* of
study.. ' I should cay It was ; your j dutyj and *It
Wtatniv la vdur orivilera to forward, this Idea
Tho. general public .little realizes the. enor
mous effect of health on prosperity. When an
Englishman is sent' into a. tropical country i:e
is paid a double salary. -He expects a leave
of" absence for a year every four or five years.
He is provided with servants and all aorta of
luxuries in order to induce nlra.to remain,' and
he Is altogether an expensive servant and a
serious tax on business. When he falls 111 his
tlckuess is almost a calamity to the house that
employs him. When you send such expensive
agents cut Into tropical countries you should
take care that the medical men responsible for
their health are- really able to undertake this
and are of the best quality.
Another thing not generally realized is the
effect of the change of trade routes, such as
the Panama canal will cause. . The Suez canal
changed the trend of commerce. It brought
about a rearrangement of the commercial
w orld. A similar revolution Is in prospect
with the completion of the Panama canal. If
you open new commercial routes you Introduce
new dibeases. Before the Atlantic Ocean was
crossed by ships America was free from a
great many diseases that now are common
here.
HEALTH AND PROSPERITY.
\u25a0 I came here at the Invitation of Cboper Medi
cal College to deliver some lectures on tropical
diseases. I gave an account "of some of the
recent remarkable discoveries In this depart
ment of medicine. Theory is an excellent
thins, but not of practical value unless car
ried. Into practice. As a first step toward at
taining this result, in connection with the sub
ject I was lecturing on, I suggested that
Cooper Medical College or some similar medi
cal institution should give practical effect to
modern knowledge in tropical medicine by In
stituting a school of tropical medicine. â¢"..'>.
Within the last ten years great advances
have been made in this' Held of ' knowledge.
We â¢ now have means of preventing many of
these tropical diseases and also of checking:
their entry into sub-tropical communities such
as your own.
Sir Patrick was introduced by Dr. C^ N.

Sir Patrick's lectures have been of great
benefit to the students at Cooper's. Lady
Manson accompanied her husband on the
trip. Both declared that their stay In
California had been pleasant.
Following is Sir Patrick's address in
full:
After the luncheon he spoke of tropical
diseases and their, relation to commercial
interests here. Because of our increased
trade with tropical countries his remarks
were of great interest to the representa
tives of the Merchants' Association.
Sir Patrick's lectures were of great in
terest to physicians here. He Is peculiar
ly qualified to sptak on the subject of
tropical diseases as he was the ftrst'to
discover that the mosquito carried the
germs of yellow fever. He has devoted
the greater part of his life to research
along "this line and has made many dis
coveries that have proved of inestimable
value to medical science.
Sir Patrick Manson. the eminent En
glish physician, who has delivered a se
rifs of interesting lectures on tropical dis

Taggart of Orrville, Ohio, named as ona
of the co-respondents in the Taggart
case, was put on stand this afternoon.
Taggart followed the negress, Emma
Lyttle. who was on the stand all morn
ing. The only thing new elicited from
Emma was the alleged giving of a fins
brocaded silk dress to the Filipino
woman. Augustina. by Captain Taggart
at Christmas time while in Manila.
Bill Taggart entered a general de
nial to the allegations as to improper
conduct between Mrs. Taggart and him
self. Mrs. Taggart's attorneys stated
this evening that Mrs. Taggart would
take the stand to-morrow morning,
provided Billy Taggart's cross-exami
nation was finished.
! Mrs. Lyttle denied that she told Nora
Murphy that Mrs. Taggart's actions on
the train with the young man wera
such as to make the passengers inqutro'
if they .were married. She denied that
she ever saw Mrs. Taggart sitting on
Clinto Spencer's lap in Chicago. "Wit
ness explained the appearance of Billy.

gart's washing at Orrville by saying
that while Mrs. Taggart was in Cincin-
I natl Billy came to her (Emma) and
'\u25a0 asked permission to send his clothes to
, the wash with theirs.
After the noon recess . Billy Taggart
took the stand and on direct examina
tion gave himself and Mrs. Taggart
estimable characters and stated that oa
the occasion of the captain's arrival In
Orrvllle with the children from San #
Francisco he and the captain had threa \u25a0
drinks of whisky together out of thÂ«
! same bottle, furnished by the captain.
On cross-examination he told of order
ing a doublet-set diamond ring from a
house In New York by mail. He paid
$1 for it and afterward advertised It in
the Orrvllle Cresoent as lost and of
fered $50 for its return. He denied
that he told James Hamilton, editor of
the Crescent, that the ring belonged to
Mrs. Taggart and cost $500. Billy '
swore that he was never guilty of Im
proper actions with Mrs. Taggart; that
he' never stayed overnight at Mrs. Tag
gart's house while she was there, but
said that he frequently went there to>

eerious condition, though it is thought he
will recover.
Caskey refuses to talk about the case.
After he brought Vonzlie to the hospital
en Wednesday evening he was around
town t-pending money freely, evidently

in great fear of him. Caskey "visited

covered this mornlnsr when a friend
went to the place to deliver Studxln
skl's mall. Being unable to open tha
door, and getting no response. hÂ«
looked through the window and saw
the body lying on the floor. /An exam
ination showed that Studzlnski had
been hit on the head by a blunt in
strument and probably Instantly killed.
A trunk and suitcase were . standing
open and their contents stolen.
On the victim's breast the murderer
had placed a small card, upon which

years before coming: to Lewiston. He
had lived . here for the past six years.
There Is no clew to the murderer.

'.With the comlngj to-day of representa
tives of the ' American* Wine Growers' As
soclatlon to this cityV proceedings of -vast
Importance to the wine industry
ofthe-i.Unite"d States'may be ushered' in.
Andrea Sbarboro; said yesterday .that the
visit of : the ' Eastern men amounts to
much more than a pleasure excursion. -
\u25a0 " Legislation that Is important to wine
men, either In thetr favor or. detrimental
.to the winemakers jof America,, is always
a .Congressional": possibility. To obtain
'concerted action regarding legislation and
a good' business- understanding between
all winemaklng .sections .of the . United
Slates. is of the highest importance to all
concerned. This understanding ' may be
achieved in the next few days. Heretofore
misconception has existed and the wine
men of the East and those of. the Pacific
Coast have not acted in concert. If unity
of purpose Is brought about now the visit ;
of the Ea"stern men will make history.
I For. some days a' committee of \u25a0 the \u25a0
Eastern wine men has been in Southern
California. \u25a0' They have inspected vine
yards and learned about California meth
ods. To assist in entertaining them P. C.
Rossi, Percy T. Morgan- and 1 Professor
Thwight of the University of California^
went through the San Joaquin Valley and'
explained :%p the visitors its viticultural
wealth and winemaking processes. When
they .reach this city they will have more
entertainment before them. They will be
escorted to Astl to-morow by Mr. Rossi,
where they will be welcomed by Mr.
Sbarboro at the Italian-Swiss Colony. The
visitors include Edward R. Emerson,
president of the American Wine Growers'
Association; Lee J. Vance, secretary of
the same association; F. M. Randall and
Jules Crance.
Some time ago . the American Wine
Growers' Association was to have held a
convention in this city. At the time set
for starting from the East some of the
officers of the association were taken ill.
The delegates came and looked about, but
did not convene. Now the officers are to
view California vineyards and California
wine cellars. . . '.X
Some of the committee are already well
known in California. Mr. Vance, who ls
owner and editor of the American Wine
Press, toured the State last year.' Ed
ward R. Emerson is president of the
Brotherhood Wine Company and is a
noted author on viticultural subjects. The
chief value of the visit will be in the con
ferences, which it Is hop<!d will unify the
interests of American wine growers.

John Foley, ensign In the Naval Militia and
captain of Phelps Squadron, Veterans of the
Epanlsh-American War. died yesterday of pneu
monia, after a brief Illness. Foley was la
charge of the naval reserve training chip Ma
rion. He served for about twenty years In the
regular navy and was of Invaluable aid to the
citizen sailors In the State organiratlon. Foley
vu a man-of-ware-man of the old type, and
X the traditions of the navy In its more plctur
eequ* days were to him almost a religion. He
was a thorough sailor, and nothing pleased him
bettar than to flad an apprentice audience for
his forcible and Interesting yarns of the days
when be was In the service. The news of his
death will come as a great shock to many,
and few men 'connected with the Naval Militia
would bÂ« more elncerely regretted than will
â¢â¢Jack" Foley. eailorman. Like Tom Bowling:
"Faithful, below, he did his duty.
And now he's gone aloft."
"Death Has Broached Him To."
The steamship Newport of the Pacific Mall
Company't Panama fleet arrived yesterday
frcm the Isthmus with a large number of Rus
sian Immigrants who are bound for Los An
geles to Join the Rueslan colony there. These
immigrants landed at Colon without either
monpy or transportation for the completion of
their Journey from. Russia. They secured work
on the isthmus and there maintained them
selvps until somebody in Los Angeles for
warded them the means to reach San Fran
cisco. They found the climate of the Isthmus
very deadly, and during- their short stay clx-
Tft-n babies died. Another baby died during
the voyage up the coast, and two more, clck,
tr.- detained with their mothers on Angel Isl
and. Before being allowed to land here the
Russians were taken to Angel Island and
bathed while their clothes were being fumi
gated.
H. Peterson, a eteerag* passenger on the
Newport from Panama, paints a very black
picture of the business outlook on the Isthmus.
Eta was engaged in the manufacture of tobacco
end says he left there a bankrupt, a victim of
hard times. He says there is a great deal of
eicknees and believes there will be much more
when the rains begin.
The Newport brought 754 tone of cargo, and.
In addition to the Russians, a lew cabin pas

WINXEBAGO, WHICH WILL.
LEAVE TO-DAY FOR MOJI.
A fishing dory, flat of bottom and with
scant free-boaid. even in line weather is
cot an attractive craft; in exposed wat
eis and in anything like heavy weather
It Is about the last thing on which life
lovlns mortal would care to trust him
self. Three members of the crew of the
fishing schooner John F. Millet, however,
weathered a terrinc Bering Sea storm in
& frail dory, and to-day speak lightly of
their experience.
The Miller arrived yesterday from the
North with 67,tfK) codfish. These fish were
all caught with hand lines and on July
15, when the fishermen of the Miller were
out In the dor.es persuading codfish to
take the bait on their hook-armed lines,
a sudden gale 6wept the waters. All but
one dory reached the schooner, which
Eoon had all she could do to take care of
herself. She was hove to for many hours.
After such weather only fishermen would
have dreamed of looking for the missing
boat. But the Miller was manned by
fishermen and as soon as .he storm
passed search parties were sent out.
The men In the dory battled with the
elements for a day and a half. At the
end of that time they maoe land and half
dead with exposure and hunger crawled
up the beach and under the beat of a
pitlleee rain all fell asleep. After a few
hours' rest one of the trio went Inland
and rinding a settlement secured food far
himself and his shipmates. They had just
finished their first meal when one of the
boats from the schooner was sighted and
within an hour the three men were sleep
ing soundly in their bunks on board the
schooner.
During the storm the three wno were
rescued sighted another doxy In which
were two men. They sighted the other
boat at Intervals between rain squalls
for about half an hour. Suddenly she
disappeared and they believe she went
to the bottom. It Is supposed the men
in the other dory were from the schooner
Zampa.
The Miller spoke three other codnshexs
July 28 in the Bering Sea and they re
pcrted their luck as follows: . Schooner
fctanley. 102,000; barkentlne Fremont. 103,
000, and schooner Zampa, 90,000.

ENOUGH TO KILL TEN.
r T"Â»HE United States had once a promising export trade in cheese.
I In an evil hour some one discovered that cheese could be made
* from skim milk and filled with lard iii place of the cream that
was taken from it. This appealed to avarice. A dairyman could make
butter and cheese from the same milk, and thrive' exceedingly on the
double profit. All went weir for a time, but the secret was too big
to be "cheesed," and the European consumer found that instead of
the former American cream cheese, he was. eating a mixture of curd
end hog's, grease. , V.-.V*
Right there the trade stopped and no effort has been able to
start it again. The breach was filled by the milkmen of Canada, and
now honest Canadian cheese is in such demand in Europe that the
home market is not fully supplied. It is the principal dairy export
of the Dominion and last year amounted to nearly $22,000,000. The
price has risen with the export demand and the American dairyman
is compelled to lament the profit he has lost through commercial
dishonesty. - \u25a0 â¢ -
There is a lesson in this that may be taken to heart by all
men -who produce for the export trade. Non-observance by them of
the requirements, of commercial honor will destroy trade more ef
fectually, than even the differential tariff of Germany. A good arti
cle, true to name, will find a market among those who want the best
and can pay for it, no matter how high the tariff may be. A' poor
article cannot be helped by a low tariff.' California especially needs
to have this branded upon the commercial conscience. In, our pre
served fruit products and wines and brandies we have the power to
influence the markets of the world, if they are pure and properly pre
pared. If we practice sophistication or attempt to market a bad
product as good, we. may read our fate in the history of filled
cheese- . - â f

THE GRAND JURY REPORT.
THE organs of the municipal administration have endeavored to
mitigate the effect of the report of the Grand Jury by throwing
mvA at the members of that body. An inspection of the names
of the jurymen, signed to the report, reveals the fact that they arc to
an unusual degree representative citizens. They, have no personal
motive whatever in the discharge of their duty. Perhaps, the differ
ence between them and others who have held the same position in
the p?.st is that, no matter what personal interests, business compli
cations or other Things might press them to a merely perfunctory j
performance of their duty, they have chosen' to be thorough,.accu
rate and fearless.
Their rep<srt is a volume in the iiterature of civics. Every
statement is supported by specifications. Any citizen can take the
book in hand and go and' verify for himself what the jury has pub
lished for all to read. The c.ity is fortunate in being represented in
such a body of men willing not only to give their time to .pains
taking investigation, but with the courage to sign and publish their j
findings regardless of the delinquents affected by it, or whether they
are in the executive or the judicial branch of the local government.
The mud slingers are unable to find any motive on the part of the
jury except the desire to faultlessly discharge a trying duty. The
organs have chosen to say that the jury was actuated Tkv partisan
considerations. But the members were of all' parties, and the delin
quents they put upon the grill are of all parties, so that charge ex
plodes itself.
The report presents to the people the conditions exactly as
they are. It is timely because power returns to jts source in a few
months and those who wish to terminate its abuse may commit it
to other trustees, who will so administer it as to check the evils
detected by the jury and published for all to read. What is revealed
by official investigation, under the sanction of an oath, was no
secret before. Men knew that graft and crime, the fruit of ballot
tampering, were rife under the closed eyes of the city administra
tion. They knew that as a result the city's bad name has been sent
abroad and that it was being cheated of deserved prosperity and its
progress was being checked. It is useless to say that the manner
of its government has nothing to do withihe material progress of a
city. It has a dominating influence. The members of the Grand
Jury are men who have a stake, in the welfare of San Francisco.
They know how far it is-affected by the government, and they know
more than that â they know that public duty must be discharged
faithfully, no matter' what the effect.
The whole report is summarized in its second, paragraph. To
this we invite the serious attention of the people. After sketching
the scope of the investigation this paragraph says: "The results,
however, may be summarized in the finding that wholesale and
widespread violation of law is open, notorious and flagrant ; that it
meets with the acquiescence of the Mayor; that it receives the ap
proval of the Police Commissioners; that it is aided, abetted and
protected by police officials; and we are convinced that if this con
dition be the result of incompetency, it is of such a conspicuous and
distinguished quality that it must have been studiously cultivated,
patiently acquired and amply compensated; We find that vice and
crime have been organized so systematically and fostered with such
careful attention to detail that nothing which business acumen or
political expediency could suggest has been neglected or omitted ;
and the operation of the system is so perfect that speedy detection
and swift punishment overtake the vicious and criminal who cannot
pay the price." . \u25a0 | ;
* Â«.. Who doubts the truth of that statement? There is a profit in
vice, and only the vice is-tolerated that will pay official tribute out
of its profits as the pr.ice of official protection and toleration. Offi
cialdom therefore becomes interested in the promotion of tribute
paying vice, and the system, if continued, makes a moral cesspool of
the city.
* . Anticipating that the defenders of the system would call for a
bill of particulars the jury furnishes it, in a mass of details shocking
in their nature. Not only this, but the report gives in equal detail
the official efforts that were made to check," balk and hinder the
investigation. No man with a clean and sober mind can rise from
reading this report without conviction, of its truthfulness and of the
vile condition whicrflt reveals. Mud slinging will not answer a sin
gle statement of fact, but that is the only answer so far made to
revelations which should make every decent citizen long for election
day, when power, again returned to the people, can be placed in
cleaner and more dutiful hands; and the reproach be cleansed from
the fame of San Francisco.

8CALIFORNIA PIONEER, WHO DIED
AT HIR HOME IN THIS CITY
THURSDAY.
A story is in- circulation that the
price of oil at the California wells may
be raised as the. result of a possible
deal between oil companies. The rumor
is interesting to thousands of owners
of stock in oil companies in this State,
'but there, is no way to ascertain the
Intentions of those In control." The story
'originated at Losl Angeles, but is heard
here on the street. Some of tfce con
siderations that brought credence ; : -' to
the rumor south, of Tehachaprare^onr
tamed in an article'in the Los Angeles
Times, .which in part follows: "
The second part of the deal Is \u25a0 said Ito be \u25a0
nothing more or lesa than -an agreement or â¢
combine â¢of the . Union ' and. Associated -by . the
terms 'of which"' they i,wUl ~ co-operate In the â¢
market to get belter prices for. ' Oli " through
out the State and ' wherever ' they may- seek :
business. Tiiat - would â¢be >' likely : to â¢ mean a
world-wide deal," so to speak, as both the
â¢Union- and -ABBOclated- are reaching â¢ out ; for
trade In bomb America and the Orient.
i According to reports, neither ' company \u25a0 will ,
lose its identity. Each will retain Its own
property and manage Its business, . but. there
'will be harmony inatead of the fierce compe
tition hitherto existing. : There is every reason \u25a0
to believe that the Union will naver consent
to the loss of Its Identity or part with any
part of its- property. Its officers have again
and asaln so declared,' both In official papers
and private conversations. As the Union has
between 175,000 and 200,000 acres of oil lands,
approximately four-fifths ' of -the entire terri
â¢ tory In tho titate ; refineries at San' Francisco
and Bakersfield; ptpÂ« lines from the Santa

on : the Coast and ships to ' enable it to reach
many points Independent of the '; railroads, It
Is clearly In a: position to \u25a0. maintain Inde

agreement' of mutual advantage may be
reached with the Associated. :â \u25a0\u25a0:\u25a0.â¢ : \u25a0 .".; -;,'.; ,'.

SMELTING AT NEEDLES.
"A large promise for the vicinity of
Needles la contained in the report that
a-smelting plant for the Arizona-Mex

this plant will- be '* -the ' whole - of â¢ Mohave
County. A"rtfc:UHe'dlstÂ»lct along 1 thÂ»- Colorado

now ship to San . Francisco, Salt > Lake or El

as regards the lower grades. While this is
the country most affected, the new smelter
will alao ibe the only one In all ' Southern
California and may also draw upon some
other parts of Arlsona and Nevada. "It should
make it possible to profitably work all ores

was done and . a flvÂ«-foot ledge of \u25a0 low-grada
ore, but of sufficient value to warrant the con
tinuance -ot operations, was opened .to some
extent. 3 Because the. San Francisco - owners
did not'; receive Immediate -returns they got
â¢"cold feet". and the collapse came. An effort
Is now being, made \u25a0\u25a0 to get up a company that

Baby Annie Rasmussen, tiny, confiding,
pretty once but now pale and hollow
cheeked, the marks of hunger Imprinted
on her face, has at last found a home
where she will be given good food and
motherly care. Annie's parents were ar
rested \u25a0 four weeks ago for drunkenness
and misdemeanor, and they left her alone
in the house when they went away with
the officers of the law. There she lay,
crying for helpâ cried so loud that some
kind-hearted person heard and answered.
Annie's condition was reported to the
California Society for the Prevention of
Ciuelty to Children, and a special police
man was sent after her. They found her
half-starved and quite ill. She was taken
to the City and County Hospital for
treatment.
Then one day her grandmother came
to see her. Aged Mrs. Rasmussen loved
the little babe and decided to, take It
away from the hospital. The authorities
were willing enough, for the children's
viard was very crowded,
A week passed, and the burden upon
the grandmother grew too heavy for her
to bear- The parents, released, were
5: unk.acain. and they would not care for
their own little one. .The society was ap
praled to and Superintendent M. J. .White
took the child.
It required two weeks of hard work, for
him to find a home for little Annie. Judge
Muratky committed her to several of the
charitable institutions of the city, but
they would not take such a wee thing as
was ' Annie. At last Mrs. Walter Duncan

Captain A. Ginther, acting command
er of the Russian cruiser Lena, now
lying In detention at the Mare Island
navy yard, and the chief engineer of
the vessel, S. Ratmanoff, have been
placed upon the persona non grata list
of the Palace Hotel.
At an early hour yesterday morning
the v two Russian officers and two wo
men guests at the hotel, one of whom
is said to be the wife of an American
Consul In Russia, who have .been stay
ins at the Palace, were hustled out of
the big hostelry arid given to under
stand that their patronage would here
after be unwelcomed by the manage
ment.
During the early part of the evening
the Russians and their companions
visited a dance hall in the rear of an
uptown saloon and imbibed freely, of
wine, concluding their carousal there
about 2 o'clock in the .morning by
quarreling with the manager of- the
place, who slapped the captain's face.
A fight would have ensued, but for In
terference from other patrons, and the
much-Incensed Russian officials and
their companions finally left the place
and returned to the Palace, where they
proceeded to disturb the guests of the
usually peaceful hotel. â¢ A watchman
was sent to quell the hilarious scene
In one of the apartments occupied by
one of the women, and he accomplished

CINCINNATI. Ohio, Aug. ' 25.â Mac
Blanehie Frcdin. a distinguished
French woman, is dead, from pneu
monia, at her home here, aged 62' years.
She was the organizer in this country
of the Alliance Francais and was wide
ly known in literary circles.
Noted French Woman Dead.
ThÂ«syndlcate forecasted a Ruef triumph.
It is obvious that the correspondents got
their "dope," so to speak, from the head
quarters of Schmitz and Ruef, Explana
tions-at this time to account. for .Ruef 's
defeat make matters worse for - the in
land press contributors. Ruef was beaten
because good citizens went to the polls.
The large vote of 41,000 accounts for the
disaster to the grafters.
Moreover, an analysis of the voting
plainly discloses' the truth that fully 8000
members of the Union Labor party voted
for the so-called Ruef Republican dele
gates. The very light vote cast for the
Union Labor party delegates makes that
proposition clear.
The followers of Ruef and Schmitz did
not throw their, votes to the anti-Ruef
delegates proposed by the San Francisco
Republican League.
The League Republicans won the con
vention In an open battle and will win
again in the November election. The talk
that Herrin and the Citizens Alliance
control the League is merely the echo of
the grafters. The League Is controlled
and directed by the best forces of citizen
ship In San Francisco.
'me League is now devoting its energies
to the work -of registration. The organi
zation I* doln* , everything that can be
done to induce unregistered citizens to
register for the municipal election. The
same kind of methodical work that was
done to bring out a big vote at the prim
ary will -be performed in order to bring
out an overwhelming army of. good citi
zens to fight the grafters on: November 7.
The registration will exceed 90,000 and the
vote ' may - reach 72.000. It is now esti
mated that the Joint nominee of the Re
publican and Democratic conventions will
be supported at the polls by 37.000 voters.
Ruef sees his finish and is making pre
parations for travel abroad. He com
prehends that a coalition of Republicans
and Democrats will render Schmitz's re
election impossible. He is devoting all
of his energies 'and applying' all of his
resources to defeat coalition. Hie knowl
edge that he* ie working ( on this line, in
creases the determination of Republicans
and Democrats to 'coalesce.
The syndicate that supplies the interior
newspapers with political gossip from
the metropolis is not able to account for
Ruef s defeat at the recent primary elec
tion. One. of the writers of the bureau
holds that Ruef would have gained the
convention if the county committee had
fixed the apportionment on "the basis of
the vote cast at the gubernatorial instead
of the Presidential election. The facts
are just the reverse of the correspond
ent's statement. The vote cast for the
Republican nominee for Governor in 1902
in the districts south of Market street
was light and the vote for his opponent,
Lane, was unusually heavy; hence the
districts which Ruef carried in the late
primary contest would have had very
light representation in the Republican
convention If the vote for Governor had
been taken on the basis; of apportion
ment. -

Straight Prom Coffeedom.
I Coffee can marshal a good squadron
of enemies and some very hard ones to
overcome. A lady In Florida writes:
"I ha\ - e always been very fond of
frood coffee, and for years drank it at
least three_ times a day. At last, how-
ever, I found that It was Injuring- me.
"I became bilious, subject to frequent
Â«.nd violent headaches, and so very ner-
vous that I could not lift a sjioon to my
mouth without spilling a part of its
contents; my heart got 'rickety' and
beat Â£O fast and so hard that I could
scarcely breathe, while my skin got
thick and dini?y, with yellow blotches
3u my face, caused by the condition of
my liver and blood. I made up: my
mind that all these afflictions cams
from the cortae, and I determined to ex-
periment and see. ' ,
"So I quit coffee and grot a package of;
postum, which furnished my hot morn-
ing beverage. After a little time I was
rewarded by a complete restoration of
aiy health in every respect. I do not
iuft>r from biliousness any more. . my
neadflch^s have disappeared, my nerves
ire as steady as could be desired, my '
neart beats -regularly and my com-
i plexion has cleared up beautifully â the
iy^lotches have been wiped out and. it is
luch a pleasure to be well again."

named for the event, which will bÂ« run

furlongs of the course Into a stretch of

The Futurity Is the goal toward which
the ambition of every horseman points
snd around which cluster the best tradi
tions of the American turf. Rfch In
money. It being worth over $30,000, and
memories extending as far back as the
great struggle In which Proctor Knott
iame home a scant winner over the great
Salvator, thexe is more for the winner
of a Futurity than any of the other prizes
cftered by the American racing associa
tions.
The Futurity has always been a close
raeÂ«Â» but in all the years of Its running
horsemen agree that the field that will
face the starter to-morrow is the most
*-venly matched and most puzzling that
they have ever been called upon to Judge.

ANNUAL DINNER
The racing at the automobile, motor
cycle-and bicycle meet to be held at_ the
Ingleside., track on Sunday, September 3,
promises to be highly , interesting, some
close, contests- being expected. Though
no extremely high-powered cars will take'
part,- some keen racing will be seen, the
best operators in the city having entered.
George P. ; Fuller, the amateur who drove
so brilliantly at the Del Monte meet of
the Automobile Club of California and; at
Los Angeles last year, has returned from
a long trip in , Europe and will probably
pilot his car at Ingleside.
Permission to hold the three motor
car races has been given by L. P. Lowe,
chairman of the executive committee of
the Automobile Club- of California, and
the sanction of the American Automobile
Association has been | received. \ The ar

: V O." Lentz, a noted German. motor-cyclist,
now at San ; Diego, has entered' all the
motor cycle events." At Berlin last year
Lentz took | part in one' of the greatest
motor ; cycle races ever held, â¢ covering
72.53 kilometers in an hour. The motor
bicyclists of San Francisco and neighbor
hood,,some'of whom are among the fast
est in the United States," are delighted at
the prospect of meeting so well known a
performer., ... - .'.
A neat booklet of thirty-six pages has
just been Issued by the Automobile Club
of California: It contains a list \of the
officers and governors,, the- by -laws, a list
of honorary and active members,- a pic
ture of the club badge, and a copy of the
law regulating the operation of 'motor
vehicles on ; public highways in the State
of California. "i\ A circular: accompanying
the club book states that the membership
has . increased -, from ; 150 to 400 during the
past year and that the influence of the
club Is much greater than these figures in
dicate. â : In -, order to accomplish . the ' most
effective work for good roads * the direc
tors desire to. get; 1200 active members of
the club, ; and .. state \ it should not , be dif

The â¢ fleet of the San . Francisco Yacht j
Club will cruise to Vallejo to-day and â¢
to-morrow will : hold its second race of â¢
the season down 'â¢ to Sausalito: The tide !
turns to flood at 1 :50 o'clock this after
noon at Fort Point, so there will be no
difficulty in making Vallejo in good time
In- the evening. It is high water to-mor
row, at 10 a. m., and tne racing yachts
i will Btart at 11a.m., so the first part of j
| the race will be against a flood tidei The '
yachts will start on signal from the flag
ship'and will have ten minutes in which
to cross an , imaginary line drawn from
the float of the Vallejo Yacht Club to the
nearest point on the Mare : Island shore.
The time of starting of each boat will be
taken from | the shore, and owners must
I announce the name of their yacht to the
timekeeper on the float as they cross the
j line.
â¢ : The finish will be across an imaginary
line drawn from the clubhouse wharf to
a stakeboat anchored about 300 yards
easterly from, the " clubhouse, the stake
boat to be left on the starboard hand.
In determining the time made by each
yacht for the race the arbitrary handi
cap. allotted by . the. -regatta committee
will be ' deducted from the actual sailing
time. Prizes will be awarded to the
yachts taking first, second and third place.
The regatta committee, consisting of
Roy C. Ward, Henry G. .Toll and Loring
P. Rixford.' has' allotted the following ar
bitrary handicaps to the boats of the
fleet: Schooners Aggie and Chispa, yawl
Tramontana \u25a0 and sloop Challenger,
scratch; sloop Annie, ten minutes; sloop
Queen, fifteen- minutes; schooner White
Wings and sloops Thelma and Sappho,
twenty minutes: schooners Virginia and
Martha, thirty, minutes; sloop Thetis, for
ty minutes; sloops Amigo. Ariel and Mln
netonka, forty-five minutes: sloop Nauti
lus, fifty minutes, sloop White Heather,
fifty-five minutes; sloop Merope, one
hour; sloop Phoenicia and , schooner
Josephine, one hour and fifteen minutes;
sloop Curlew and yawl Royal, one hour
and thirty minutes; yawl Wave, one hour
and thirty-fU'e minutes; sloops Surprise,
and Juanlta and yawl Jester (formerly
Ripple), one hour and forty-five minutes;
yawl Witch, two hours, and sloop Zada,
two hours and thirty minutes.
After several attempts the race for the
Wallace trophy of- the California" Yacht
Club has been held, the winner being J.
J. Sherry's sloop Perhaps, which had a
lead of four minutes' nine seconds over
the second yacht. The* wind was light at
starting, but blew strongly in the chan
nel. T.i Kendall's sloop Albert did not de
velop anything like- the speed- her owner
has claimed for her. On the run home
the wind dropped, but picked up again,
so that the yachts were enabled to reach
the finishing line.
The annual up-river cruise of the Corin
thian fleet, which ended last Sunday, was
successful, r Fulton Berry's sloop . Nixie
started >a day later than the flagship
Speedwell, the yawl Truant and the sloop
Genesta, but made a fine run and sighted
the rest of the fleet at' Ida Slough on
Monday, the 14th inst. The fleet anchored
at Walnut Grove on the lath Included the
Speedwell, Genesta. Truant, Nixie. Emilie
and". Pactolus.' "On board the Pactolus,
which carried a Corinthian flag, were A.
M. and Mrs. Clay. Miss Clay and J. Gar
diner. Frank Pixley started with three
companions on. the; Emilie. but all had to
leave at Black Diamond, after which her
owner sailed alone. On board the Nixie
were Mr. and Mrs.' FV G. Berry, and two
others. The Nixie and Truant were towed
up to Sacramento, but the rest of the
yachts did .not get much higher than
Walnut Grove. On Thursday, . the 17th.
the fleet began the return Journey, mak
ing Rio Vista that afternoon. Army Point
on Friday and Paradise Cove on Satur
day, where "several Corinthian boats had
dropped anchor to welcome the returning
yachts.
The party on board the schooner White
Wings at Santa Cruz began the return
journey yesterday. During their - stay of
nearly two weeks at the seaside town
they . had ,the time of their lives, receiv
ing much , attention from the residents.
They enjoyed their .visit >so greatly, that
some of them . say they will *go ' again
next year if they have to row down. It
is quite likely the Speedwell and Nixie,
with one or two other boats,' may make
the ocean cruise during", the season of
1906.- "\u25a0. / \u25a0 ..- \u25a0

Only one tennis tournament will be
played before the opening of the annual
coast championship events next Saturday
at San Rafael. The members of the la
dies' annex to the Golden Gate Tennis
Club will meet In the sixth of a series of
handicap singles tournaments for the
Van Vliet trophy to-day. Miss Sarita Van
Vliet and. Mrs. C. "Wattson have each won
the cup twice. The former has left tha
State and will not be in future competi
tions. Miss Ida Mearns has her name
J inscribed on the trophy once. Miss Van
! Vliet will be greatly missed at the park,
where she has figured prominently in all
of the ladles' events for the past year.
She did not have a pretty sÂ£yle, but man
aged to win from more showy players.
She has won a majority of the tourna
ments played on the public courts sines
she commenced playing there. ,-
An unusually large number of fair ex
perts affixed their signatures to the en
try ' list, and the competition to-day
should be an interesting one. The poorer
players have not been given large enough
handicaps to win. but there should bo
some close matches between the players
at and below- scratch.
Miss Lulu Wegener will take the place
left vacant by Miss Van Vliet and will
allow all of the other contestants liberal
odds. Her first match, with Miss Vod
den, should be the most Interesting of tha
opening round.
Following are the drawing and handi
caps. .

' Every, player with a semblance of abil
ity is practicing hard for the coast cham
pionship events, which commence on the
Hotel Rafael courts at San Rafael next
Saturday. These are the last and most
Important championship tournaments of
the year, and each and every racket
wielder, who figures to have a chance to
win. and many who do not. are doing all
In their power to be in the best of shape
for the competition. Los Angeles, as in
the past, will send a strong aggregation,
and it is expected the lion's share of the
honors will go south this year. The Sutton
sisters, of course, will annex everything
in their line, and. with Bell In the men's
events, the home players will find it no
easy matter to win either singles or
doubles. .
Fred Adams, ' the young phenom who
has- come to the* front* with such a rush,
looks to have the best chance to beat the
southern cracks. He Is a trifle short in
experience, but plays an effective game.
He has done all that has been asked of
him" thus far, and If he does not win the
highest honors he will at least make a
creditable showing. Just how he would
come out with a man like Bell Is a prob
lem that will be solved before Septem
ber 9.
Percy Murdock is the only other player
In the bay counties whose chances look
at all bright. Murdock has not played
his best game this year, but may do so
next' week. He Is anxious for a return
match with Adams, who won from him. In
July by a small margin.
Reuben Hunt, the Alameda player
who has won many tournaments In
the East, will be one of the strongest
players in the competition. . He did not
do himself Justice last .. year, but
should be an important factor In tha
approaching tournaments.
: Carl Gardner, the San Francisco ex
pert who annexed the county cham
pionship in May, has not done any
thing startling since. Instead ot Im
proving right along, as was expected,
he , has undoubtedly gone, back. His
present form will not carry him far
into the tournament.
George Janes Is probably the strong
est player of the California Club, but
he "proved no match * for Adams two
weeks ago. The Bush-street club- will
have the poorest representatives it has
had in years and stands little chance of
winning any of the events.
The tournament will commence Sep
tember 2 at 10 a. m. and the conclud
ing, match will be played September â¢
at 2:30 p. m. Champion J. D. Mac Ga
vin will not defend and the title will go>
to the 'tournament winner. George
Baker and Will Allen are the doubles
champions, but the latter is out of tha
State and the title will go by default.
Miss May Sutton. world's ' champion,
will defend, as will her sisters, ' Miss
Violet and Miss Florence, who won the
doubles last year. Miss Violet Sutton
and Trowbrldge . Hendricks hold the
mixed doubles championship.
The, tournament committee in charge
of the events is composed of R. T.
Crawford â¢ (chairman), Grant M. Smith.
S. R. Marvin. Fred Adams and C. Percy
Murdock." Grant Smith will act as ref
eree. Entries close Friday. September

Both missed lefts fcr' the--head and Ryan
missed a right swing for the Jaw. Ryan then
swung his rlffht hard to the head, and both
missed \u25a0 several vicious swings and , short-arm \u25a0
blows at close range. Gardner, shot his left
to the face and at close quarters Ryan hooked!
left to Gardner's face. < Gardner sent his
left hard to the face twice and at close range
Ryan cut hie right to 'the body, and, backing
away, Â«tot In a full left swing to the face.
Then they exchanged rights to the body and
Ryan followed it with a short left arm. Jolt,
to the Jaw. \ The bell \u25a0 rang and the round
ended with j the \ honors about even. Ryan
took a brace In this round and made the

Ryan swung viciously for the Jaw, with right,
but it- wcrt around Gardner's head. A left
reached Gardner's chin and another, left swing,
went wild, * Gardner executing some, clever fan
cy-blocking. Ryan ; missea : left uppercut for
the Jaw, and Gardner sent straight left to the
Jaw andva moment later, sent s Ryan to the
ropes with straight left to . the Jaw. Gardner
hocked hiÂ« \u25a0 left hard to - Ryan's jaw at this
stage. and they fought at close quarters in the

and aÂ£ they; clinched - Gardner;, landed twice

Ryanjshlfted with right, to the Jaw and drove
Gardner across . the ring; . failing, \u25a0'â¢ however,- to
land telling blows. :. Ryan again rushed, but
Massachusetts lad ftgain \u25a0 displayed this
clever work. Gardner : hit Ryan \u25a0 low i and the

i 11kb mad. Gardner ;wehf at Ryan like a ; ma
1 niac, sending him' to the | floor .with right 5 and,

ing. At noon v to-day, j amid a shower of
rice and good wishes, Jimmy j Gardner,
accompanied, by, his! brother: George,' Joe
Angell, jCharlie Nelson and I Smiling Metz
ner, boarded the midday -train for San
, Francisco. On a late train this afternoon j
Battling Nelson, his manager, Billy, No
lan, and Australian Martin Murphy;fol
lowed Gardner and his party. .
This morning Nelson did about six miles
of road work. On his return Jog he met
ltld Lecornc, one of Kentfleld's j natives,
with a deer. It was a spike buck and
was still warm, having been killed with
a sHotgun a few minutes previous. Bat
tling looked at it admiringly and said to
Billy Nolan: / -' : i
"Bill, don't, you think we . had - betterj
carry a shotgun or rifle with us? Yester
day we could have secured a nice bag of
quail out of the several bevies which
flew off the road between San Quentin
and San Rafael. We can't tell but what
we may meet a bear next." . : . <
Billy Nolan said: "We may be Jugged,'
as It is unlawful to shoot on. the countyj
road." . \u25a0 >
Bat was willing to take the chances,',
but Nolan could not see it that way, and
Battling and the party pjogged on. -This
afternoon he began- his outdoor work in
the new arena. There .were about twenty
five spectators, some of whom were of the
fair sex, who j peered from windows j fac
ing the arena and others from behind
watermelon crates during the entire per
formance. Battling put in several min
utes shadow' boxing and ropfr-skipping.
The me'dlclne ball was rapidly and vigor
ously exchanged with Lundie. They fol
lowed with a one-round wrestling bout.
Then came the event which had been
looked for the past weekâ a short four
round sparring bout,- in which Lundie
and .Battling exchanged .many,?, sharp
\u25a0 blows. Although the ; ; sun was glaring
strongly in his - face. Battling did not
seem to pay any attention and went along
as though he were in a real fight." "" i
He remarked that he thought it would
be warmer, 'and he said that he 'felt
fresher after his outdoor work than when
he did half as | much gymnasium work.
He did not -go near the gymnasium to
day. His lip is practically entirely, healed'
and he will box : every afternoon during
his training here.

STAN'DIXti OF THE CLUBS.
Battling Dane Urges His
Manager to '*',] Take Along
Gun v While on the Road
Special Dispatch to The Call.
Tiu- attendance was the largest In
th<! history of fighting at Colma. The
pH\-lUon was packed almost to the suf
focating point. The receipts are said
to have been more .than $6500. The big
crowd was handled on the return jour
ney to the city without confusion. The
car service was adequate \u25a0 for the un
u&ual demands placed upon it.
3*fore the fighters entered the ring
Billy Jordan, master of ceremonies, ob
jected to the smoking and asked the
spectators to "Please put' out them
torches." There was an unusual ar-
ray of pugilistic talent paraded through
the ring. Jimmy Britt was greeted with
cheers when he was presented as "the
pride of California." In response to calls
for a SDeech he said complacently,
"Well. I done it. I fight Kelson here
on September 9. All I want Is an even
break, and may the best fighter win."
There were calls for Nelson, but the
spectators <J!d not recognize that youth
when he entered the, ring as one of
Gardner's seconds. He was . finally
brought to the center of the ring and
â¢was presented as the nut in
the profession to crack." He said:
"Gentlemen. I will do the best I can to
win my next fight." 'There* was some
trouble over the gloves and it was
finally decided to toss a coin for choice. 5
Manager Reid won the toss for Ryan.
It practically meant nothing, as the
gloves were Identical. Gardner was
seconded by his brother, George.' Harry
Foley. Joe Angell end Battling Nelson.
In Ryan's corner were \u25a0 Manager Reid,
Spider Kelly, Tim McGrath and \u25a0Willie
Fitzgerald.
Ryan fights and looks lika Young Cor
bett.. He is cool under fire* and it. seems
no difficulty for him to hit from. any
position. After the tenth round much of
the steam left his blows and he did not
seem to worry Gardner so much as in the
earlier stages of the contest. After a
wild slugging match in the eighth round
Gardner had a severe cut over the left
eye, where he came in contact with
Ryan's head. In the next round Gardner
started Ryan's nose bleeding and near
the end of the round had him. in distress.
Ryan tried, to take It easy in the tenth
round, tfut Gardner kept after. him, pay
ing particular attention to his sore nose.
He caught Ryan sideways early in the
round and popped a jolty right to the
head, which nearly landed on the point
of the jaw. Ryan came back with a left
to the head, which shook up Gardner
badly. Ryan landed a left to the body,
but received a. hard right in return. Near
the end of the round Gardner again sent
in a straight right to "the head.
Ryan came up fresh in the eleventh
round, in which it was give arid take
throughout. Early in the round Gard
ner played for the head, but toward the
end he paid particular attention to the
body. He was ripping in lefts which
were undoubtedly hurting - Ryan. The
twelfth was all Gardner's round, while
in the thirteenth he seemed to be rest
ing up, as Ryan did the most effective
work. Ryan was forcing . matters
again 4n the fourteenth round, but
<ia.rdr.er was scoring. all the time with
choppy rights and lefts, ..which traveled
but a few inches, but which seemed
to have considerable sting In them.
From the way the fight was going, it
was evident Gardner would ultimately
wear out Ryan unless the latter could
land one of his swings on the shifty
boxer from Lowell.
v a '\u25a0*.. ..ATTKXDAXCE IS LARGE.
The ring filled with spectators in an
instant and in the tumult which ensued
Referee Roche â¢ declared all bets off. In
explanation of this he said the betting
did not look good, as while Ryan was
supposed to be as good a man as Gard
ner the latter closed a 1 to 2 favorite, the
market being flooded with money to bet
on the Lowell boy. After the ring was
cleared Ryan was laid out on the floor
for seme minutes and was then carried
to his dressing room. An examination of
his body did not show any discoloration
or swelling, such as would appear had
the blow been a foul one.
As Ryan did not respond to the call of
time at the beginning of the sixteenth
round Gardner is credited technically
with a knockout. There were, a number
of fouls claimed during the fight and the
referee found It necessary to caution both
boxers. Ryan was as great an tiffender
in this respect as Gardner. The fight
was an earnest one from start to finish,
and for ten rounds there was but little
to choose between the two men, as they
seemed equally effective. Gardner is a
master judge of distance and of " time,
and some of his blows seemed to have
terrible force behind them.
RYAX IS COOL UXDERFIRB
The referee shook his head, declining to
do bo. By this time the seconds had all
crowded into the ring and there was loud
talking and wild gesticulating." The gong
sounding the end of the round caused a
momentary cessation of tne. talk and
Ryan "was carried to his corner. He
seemed to be Buffering great pain and
was apparently unable to continue the
contest. Spider Kelly tossed a towel into
the ring, signaling defeat. There were
still cries for the referee to give the fight
to Ryan on a foul, but this he refused to
do, claiming the blow was a fair one.
BETS ARE DECLARED OFF.
Gardner had been using his left to tha
body with telllne; effect for â¢everal
rounds, some of the blows resounding
through thÂ« house- aa though a drum had
been struck. Ryan, who Is built on the
came pudgy lines as Toung Corbett, waa
evidently hurt by the blows. Near the end
of the fifteenth round Gardner suddenly
brought over one of these blows, which
landed in the solar plexus region. 'Ryan
sank to the floor and his face indicated
he was in great pain. As he recovered
his senses it must have seemed to him
that all the spectators were on their feet
yelling like mad and claiming a fouL The
round had not ended, but Billy Gallagher,
the official timekeeper for Ryan, Jumped
Into the ring and pointing to the prostrate
boxer called on Referee Roche to give the
fight to him on a foul.

fight at this . ftage. Ryan sent right- to the
etomach and Gardner sent left to thÂ© face

as the bell rang. A feature of the round was
Gardner's left-hand work, he repeatedly send
ing that -member to Ryan's i face. - from â¢ which
the blood flowed freely. IV was Gardner's
round.
i They fought to a clinch, with Gardner on
the aggressive. Ryan, missed left hook for-the
body and then drove his right to the Jaw and
planted his left to the stomach, Gardner com
plaining to the referee, intimating that the
blow was low. Gardner complained ' again as
Hyan started another for the body, and in a
fierce mix-up Gardner sent Ryan's head back,
and Ryan opened a deep gash over Gardner's
eye with a terrific right. Both men fought
furiously, Kyan being much the cooler of the
two. They exchanged hard taps and Ryan
drove Gardner's head back with a right swing
to the Jaw. Gardner also sent Ryan back,
but the blow was not of sufficient force to
feaze Ryan. -Gardner went to his corner
bleeding freely. ; Ryan had much the better
of the round. - -.'--'.' . ,v: ','/â¢,'\u25a0 r'J

face, but was rewarded with a hard i left to

Ryan with a vicious right to his Jaw and the
crowd yelled for Gardner. Gardner had much
the better of. the round and seldom missed
his left when he started it - for Ryan's Jaw

stage. \u25a0 ' '-â¢â¢

Jliamr Gardner nu declared the victor over Buddy Ryan at the end of
the fifteenth round of their fight at Colma last nleat by Referee Roche.
The Lowell flffhter will never receive due credit for hiÂ» work. Ryan
claimed a foul near the end of the fifteenth round and vrhen this was not
allowed he either could not or would not leave bis corner at the begin
ning of the next round. The blow on which , the foul- waÂ» claimed was a
left to the body, which landed with crushing: force In the region of the
â¢olar plexus. The ending: was so unsatisfactory, coupled with the fact that
Gardner went from S to 10 to 1 to S favoritism, that the referee declared all
bets off before he left the rlnff. . ,

E F- Hutton & Co.. 45W California street,
tan" Francisco, members of the New York
Stock Exchange, furnish the following official
<j u ctatl ons of that Exchange :
NEW YORK. Aug. 23-â The confused senU
rcent In the stock market was manifested to
day from the Tery outset. The tone was Ir
ifgular throughout and trading was narrow
and professional. Yesterday's movement In
Reading produced a feeling of fear which was
but partly allayed by the protestations of the
operators responsible for the movement. Read
ing's course has created a situation such as
the market has not known In several days.
but anything suggestive or a corner Is alarm
ingly reminiscent. Reading opened at a frac
tional decline, but speedily recovered. Its
movements during the 6a.r. nowever. were il
lustrative of thÂ« market's general tone. Fol
lowing its early recovery the stock, made a gain
. of 1%, only to fall 2% points below'iu clos
ing price cf yesterday. Tae market becamÂ«
feverish with declines cf 1 to 2% points in a
number of the more active Issues, including
Union Pacific. Lmilsville tnd NashTille. North
ern Pacific and Northwestern. Commission
houses had an abundance of selling orders ana
some of the best known brokerage firms we-o
open sellers In the -active list. This was C6
'recially true of Union Pacific, which was car
ried down over 2 points with ecarcely a halt.
Most of the selling offerings came from the
same sources. The break in Erie caught many
stop orders and there was an all round un
loading of weak bull accounts. In spite ot the
heavy selling of Amalgamated Copper, mucli
of it seemingly for Boston account, the stock
yielded only a point, but recovered with the
announcement of yet another advance in the
price of the metal. At different times the
market was extremely dull and showed almost
an utter absence of -support. New York Cen
tral, Baltimore and Ohio, Great Northern Pre
ferred, together with higher class Usuei, re
cording material decline*. The list steadied In
the afternoon, although Reading continued to
ad erratically. The better tone of the market
Â»&* followed by Increased periods of dullness,
which induced traders to increase their com
mitments on the ehort side. This claes as a
whole seemed disposed to play for a further
if jtction, and the leaders of the other side wero
tqually inclined to encourage new short ac-
Jriunts. Business dwindled In thÂ« last session
-"^t.-i thÂ« closing hour was the dullest of the
Jay. London, which suffered a setback with a
light ehaCing of consols, was not a factor here,
*"llinir very moderately on balances. Fore
" caEts of the weekly money movement show an
apparent loss by local banks of about $3,340,
<,(*\u25a0Â», scarcely more than one-half of the pre
vious weekly drain. The preliminary crop ds
zr.and continues, however, 5500,000 "being trans
ferred to Chicago and $200,000 to New Orleans-.
A feature or the afternoon was a slight flurry.
:n call money, which sent the rate up to 2&3%

ure, but considerable amounts were put out 'at

LAWSON AFTEU COPPER AGAIN. -
NEW YORK. Aug; 25.â A Boston" dispatch
quotes Lawson as out with ano.her ' tirade
against the market, predicting a terrific break.
He sayu there will bÂ« a great slump in stocks,
including copper metal and copper stocks bar
ring his own Copper Range and Trinity. . -
One operator says:- \u25a0 "La wson- Is out with" a
telegram predicting a sudden break In cop
per metal to the lowest price. In \u25a0 recent years
He says certain interests are making desperate
efforts to unload 900,000 shares Amalgamated
and have already unloaded 400,000 shares."
Trade authorities consider that the advance

The rtrort of Edward A. Beals. section di

Oregon Crop Bulletin. weÂ«k ended August 22.
'1 aa follows:
Light ehowers occurred during the fore part
DC thÂ« wÂ«â¬k in thÂ« lower portion of the Wil
lamette Valley and la the northern, coast coun
ties. Elsewhere throughout thÂ» State dry
v.eather prevailed. The temperature In West
ern Oregon averaged about normal, while the
east of the Cascades was slightly
<-<x>!er than usual, especially at eight.
The rain somewhat revived vegetation, but
as a whjj'.e the amounts were too email to do
ruuch good, and gardens, com. potatoes and
iactures are suffering for want of moisture.
Grain Is about all cut and In thÂ« stack.
Threshing continues in all sections. The
yields in the Willamette Valley continue die-
appointing, but In the Columbia and the Grand
ilonde valleys the returns are very gratifying.
Hops are making seasonal progress, and where
Â«\u25a0; ' raying was thoroughly done the lice have
about disarpeared. Corn ig earing and filling
r.icely and a pood crop is indicated. Stock
continues to lose flesh.
Plums acd some varieties of prunes are ripe
and being gathered. The yield of most fruits
will fall below the average, both in quality
and size. Apples and pears are small and
dropping more than usual. Peaches are plen
tiTul end of good flavor.

Ere she \u25a0 discovered the real author of
her woodpile's abnormal shrinkage, Mrs.

born of . suspicion ; some \ of her lady

The California.Wine Association filed
a certificate yesterday announcing that
it had declared a bonded indebtedness
of $2,000,000 on Its properties. It is r
Ftated in the certificate that debts and
the purchase of additional properties
make the issue necessary. The meet

was held In the Town Hall at Hercules,
Contra Costa County, on June 20 last.
The certificate bears the signature of

Ernest Moore Chadwick (alias "Sir"
Harry Westwood Cooper), on trial be
fore a Jury In Judge Cook's court on a
charge of sending by telegraph on Feb
ruary 23, 1901. a false and forged
message purporting to be from' an
other person, has failed In his effort to
exclude the deposition, of Mrs. E. J.
Kelly, formerly Miss Norlne. Schneider,
on the ground that she was his wife
and could not therefore testify against
him.
When the case was called yesterday
morning District. Attorney Byingfon in
troduced both oral and documentary
evidence of the defendant's marriage to
Mies Teresa Vanvelden at the County
Jail on April 5. 1903. the ceremony hav
ing been performed by Rev. Mr. Mont
gomery of the Church *of God. When
the couple were asked to Join bands the
prisoner shoved his hand through the
bar* of hlÂ», celL
Chadwick was called to the stand and
be fenced with the .questions put to
him by the District Attorney.' After
admitting his marriage to Norlne
Schneider on February 23. 19Q1, he was
asked If he had not previously been
married to Ida Maude Champaign in
Canada and was not divorced from her.
He declined to answer on , the ground
that It would tend to incriminate and
degrade him. He gave the same an
swer to questions as to whether he was
not previously married to Bertha
Young In Australia and another wo
man, and not divorced from either, and
as to how many women he had mar
ried. He declined to answer the ques
tion as to whether he was married In
the County Jail on April 5, 1903.
He had resided In this city and
county since March, 1901, he said, and
raised a laugh by giving his residence
as 609 Broadway instead of saying the
County Jail., He could not specify any
papers he had . seen regarding the an
nulment of his marriage \u25a0 r to . Norine
Schneider. refused to say whether
he had seen Bertha Young in court at
his former trial. C \J
Several passages-at-arms occurred
between Attorney Frank J. Murphy and
the District Attorney, each insinuating
that the other- was; deficient In his
knowledge of the law and was not a
gentleman. The Judge had to call a
halt on personalities. -
After argument on the question of
the admissiblllty of ,Mrs. Kelly's dep
osition the Judge said that particular
ly the evidence introduced by the Dis
trict Attorney during the morning was
sufficient to counterbalance the plea of
the defense. W
The deposition *of Mrs. Kelly was
then read to the Jury. and the. case. was
continued till Monday morning, whin
counsel will' make their addresses <to
the Jury. â¢
