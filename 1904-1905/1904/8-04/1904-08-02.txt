FAIR PROMOTERS PROMPT.
SACRAMENTO; Aug. i.â By a ma
jority vote, which was later made
unanimous, the State Board of Equali
zation this afternoon resolved to pass
the'assessment of San Francisco City
and County ' : as returned by Assessor
Dodge. Although members of the board
ln^ ' conversation expressed themselves
in a way to indicate that the assess
ment ot San Francisco will not be dis
turbed, 'nevertheless as a body the
board -was careful to say that Assessor
Dodge might after all be called before
it to explain some featur.es of h.is as
sessment and that to-day's action
should not be taken as final.
The total assessment of San Fran
cisco this year as made by. Assessor
Dodge }s $511,000,414. Assessor Dodge'-s
return last year was 5427,452.110, or $83.
548,304 less than this year's assessment..
It- was shown by -Assessor Dodge's
statement that he had increased his as
sessYnent of real estate $100,394,441 over
last year's figures, although lowering
his assessment on improvements from
last year's figures by $10,660,470. 'â¢
The State Board of Equalization last
year arbitrarily raised last year's total
assessment 30. per cent, or to the sum
of $545,855,324, so if, as appears likely
from to-day's action. Dodge's assess
ment is acceptable it means that' San
Frdncisco this year. will get off with an
assessment 234.854,910- less than the as
sessment forced upon it by. 'the State,
board last year.
The various members declare they
cannot now raise San Francisco's" total
even-to what it .was- last year without
putting an unjust burden on the own
ers . of real estate, whose valuation
Dodge has already put so high. .The
sentiment of the dissenting members of
*Uie board was expressed by Beamer in
the remark: "Not a. member of this
bbard would have voted to-day to raise
San Francisco's assessment in view of
Dodge's action. But we want him here
to explain how he finds the. improve
ments in San Francisco have dete
riorated by over $10,000,000. We do not'
believe\there has been any such'dete
rioration."
Although : he criticized Dodge's assess
ment Mattison voted with Alford and.
Brown against citing San Francisco to
appear, while Boamer and Colgan voted
to cite it. The vote was afterward made
unanimous against citing.
The board to-day raised *thÂ« assess
ment on the railroads in the State from
$64,180,566' to $69,669,566, or an increase'
of '|5,4S9,o6$. The San Pedno, Los An
gelfs and Salt. Lake Railroad, a new;
line, was assessed for the first time at j
$920.160..

The" better Class of people who .wish
â¢to locate-in a. new State must know riot
.pplythat the soil in ' productive, but
that" its -schools are- good. California
has takon ?uc.h high .rank now as' a
State that heV general -school system
needs little exploitation, but- there is : a
class, ef hig-hly tntelHgenf people which
Vant to be assured that the opportuni
ties for higher education are the best.
Many of this clans' of people call at the
educational exhibit and go away.satis
fied that. California affords all- the ad
vantages for mental advancement and
culture- that could be desired.
Robert Furlong is back at his post
as -chief", of the educational exhibit,
.after a short trip to Michigan'.
â¢Dr. Wa'ter'K, one of the Missouri com
missioners, was so impressed with the
flavor qf a supposed Oalifornja water

given by the Californiaus recently that
he carefully gathered up some of the
seeds that h : e might introduce the va
riety'in Mifesouri. When he subsequent
ly, loarned fhat the melon was bought
in Misso.uri, he- simply said he felt
more proud of his State -than ever. Be

by Californians that the sherry flavor
Qfsome of the melons was obtained by
grafting on to a grapevine. â¢
TAKES WILLIS' PLACE,
George A. Pennlsoiv ApiJointod Secre
tary of the California Com
missioners.
The California Commissioners to the
St. Louis Exposition have elected
George A. Denniion' secretary of the
California Commission, td succeed E.
B. Willis, who recently resigned the
position.
â¢For some' days it^has been rumored
that Dennison was to be given this im
portant position. He has been- the as
sistant, secretary of the California
State Board, of Trade and has been
connected with that body about nine
years. He is perfectly qualified to fill
the position to which he has been
elected. Appreciation of this fact has
been -manifested in several ways in the
last few months. When the San Fran
cisco building at St. Louis was ready
to receive the' exhibits from this city
the San Francisco committee picked
out Dennison as the proper man to in
stall the exhibit. Some negotiations
"went on with the California State
Board of Trade, but his services were
desired by. the board and it was'de
cided that he should remain in San
Francisco'. Then the California Com
missioners asked that he should be
sent to St. Louis, j The State Board of
Trade finally consented that he should
go on. The understanding was that he
was to become secretary of the Cali
fornia Commission. â¢ â¢. â¢ ,

The barbecue "to be given by the Gov

his. Sjate will- b'e.'one of the star func
tions of the exnosftibri. tfhe Nevada
commissioners. Colonel YerlngtOn and
â¢Senator- C..- H. E. Htardin,- are -already
letting \Vqdd cotitrax?ts and gathering
up" packing cases for kindliug, and 1 Gov
ernor; Sparks- is fattening up some. ef
his biggest steers.' Foreigners at the
fair are' getting out their not-ebbbks
and preparing to. Jot down all the in
formation th<Â»y can gather when this
holocaust, said tote an annual custom
of the/Pacific Slope tribes, is pulled.off.
IGORKOTy" ARE PLEASED.
. The only people who seem to-be well
posted on the affair are the Igbrro*es,
and they - are ' expressing: satisfaction
that -Nevada is. on .<he' opposite- side of
the' grouridp from' them. . It w.culd- be
disgusting, to them, "they say, to see
defeefierate human beings roasting and
actually eating .the. carcasses of cattle,
when so manyfa"t, wholesome dogs
â¢were : funning loose in St.' Louis. The
â¢Ifforrote "chiefs have, declared that no
Njevadans shall be' received socially by
their people. .A fund Is being made up
by them for the .purpose of presenting
"Chief" Sparks of Nevada with two or
three well-groomed dogs to - be used at
his teast- as a matter of education.
.Nevada has made a clever selection
of: commissioners.- They are versatile
and" cover the range of humanity.
Colonel Yerington .j s of .Â£he .romantic
school, and the stranger who meets him
first is In doubt as to "whether he Is an
Episcopal rector or an Oakhurst. It Is
said" that Some of the male citizens of
Nevada, who have. sat. up nights trying
to read their fates in the royal gallery
have- no' doubt whatever on this score.
Newspaper, women write ' gushing
things about Yerington, and heads of
female societies for the propagation of
bro'therly love among the Fuzzy Wuz
zips- allude to him as "that dear man."
All -this helps sell .Nevada mines and
Nevada farming lands.
Benator Hardin- is of the " rotilnd,
mirthful class, and whtle he canndt
melt, with the soulful glance as well as
his colleague, he pan hand put a "jolly"
that adds 20 per cent to the .price of
potato Jands. There never was a time
when he couldn't drop into Billy Rice's
place on the end and k^ep-the show go
ing. At Harvard they called him "Lit
tle Eva,'! but that name has faded
from him In his! sturdy marihood
HAS A READY TONGUE.
Senator Hardln .spends much of his
time- at his State's display in the Pal
ace of. Agriculture. One day a lady
wearing one of those blazing State
badges that- look like campaign ban
nens -sauntered up and busied herself
looking at the mammoth spuds and oe^
reals and mineral soap grown in Har
ain's Stateâ the agricultural specimens
as fine as any shown at the fair and
usually productive of much admiration.
. "Is that alj Nevada can grow?" asked
the fair one, with something of a tone
of contemptâ a tone some Eastern peo
ple, assume when they gaze upon those
wonderful products of the wonderful
West
Hardln had already noticed that the
blazing badge bore the . name of the
Buckeye State. He said, with a bow
equal to any of Commissioner Yering
ton'sâthey practice them togetherâ
"Madam, I know we should apologize
for thrusting these few inferior pro
ducts before the world. We should
have stayed at home and dig mineral
soap or tended the goats, and not pre
sumed to clamber on the car of pro
gress. There is only one sight I want

DR. PIEKggg _REMEÂ»IE5.
The MamiHotb anij the Mosquito
. TThat has come, to- pass "in thousands of
years Beemi hardly, credible. Primitive I
can, a weakling in comparison t& modern
.man, was able to. conquer the- huge mon-
ster* of. thousands of years ago, such as !
the Mammoth, and to-day they are dead
forever; yet. the mosquito and fly have
never been conquered. It .is now time
for the scientist to devise methods for kill-
ing the mo*qtnto and fly, so that they wi{l
ro to join the mammoth and the monster
Lizards. The .mosquitoes and flies are dan-
gerous enemies of man because they epread
contagion: -The mosquito often carries the
(Term of m*lari* with his bite. .The house-
fly epreads germs of disease orer our food.
These bacterial- germs, ever hunting for
the weak spot, find a place in ouf blood,
and then are suffer from grip, catarrh, con-
enmption, or malaria.
Dr. R. V. Pierce, chief consulting pbrsi-
-ciaa to the Invalids' Hotel and Surgical
Institute, at Buffalo, N. Y., says: "There
would be no grip epidemics, the germs of
consumption, or malaria would find no
place in the human economy, if the blood
were pare, if the lungs, heart and other
organs were fed on good blood. Poisons
should not be allowed to accumulate in the
body; to be eafe it is best to take a gentle
laxative at least once a week." Such a
vegetable laxative as Dr. Pierce's Pleasant
Pellets contains nothing which could harm
the system.
For putting the blood in order, and as a
tissue-builder and tonic for those weakened {
by coughs, colds, catarrh, grip, nothing will J
Tmild one up quicker than Dr. Pierce's j
polden Medical Discovery. This is a med- j
tcine made entirely of roots and herbs, !
jpitbout the use of alcohol.
Dr. Pierce's Medical Adviser is sent free :

stated' that he had no doubt that the
Ohio had more answered the Gov
ernment requirements, which he said
would be proved when the tidal cor
rections ; were -made. The Union Iron
Works had taken an unusual Interest
in the construction of the Ohio, he said,
because of; her being the first eighteen

Premier/Balfour said he thought the
motion was one of the most.fooHsh
which had ever been submitted to Par
liament. He declined to be a party to
restricting representative Institutions
like the Liberal Unionist Council. He
had, he said, always been- and still was
a free trader, but it was the duty of
the Government to see whether the
evils produced by protectionist coun
tries in neutral markets could not be
restricted.
Sir Henry's motion was rejected by a
vote of 38S to 210.
Joseph Chamberlain, in defending
hims?If against the heated attacks of
I*ord Hugh Cecil and other free traders,
declared the only difference between
himself and Premier Balfour was that
the latter did not think the country
would consent to colonial preference, as
it involved a food tax. -Personally,
Chamberlain said, he was certain the
question was ripe for submission to the
country and the sooner'* the general
election came the sooner he would be
pleased.

~ SANTA BARBARA. Aug. 1.â The
battleship Ohio was given her official
syead trial in the Santa Rarbara chan
ntl to-day. Although she failed by a
very small fraction of a knot to main
tain the specified speed, eighteen knots
an hour over a seventy-two-knot
course, it is almost certain that when
tidal corrections are made she will- be
found to have fulfilled the Government
specifications.. During the first half of
the trial the Ohio maintained a greater
speed than eighteen knots although
the tide and wind were against her,
but on the return journey, when con
ditions were in her favor, she slackened
up a trifle and failed by a fraction,
actual time, in the test.
The day was an ideal one for the test,
the sea was calm and there was no fog.
The favorable conditions induced those
In charge of the trial to get under way
earlier than was expected, the Ohio
casting loose from her moorings at
about 6 o'clock. After going through
thÂ«Â» usual warming up process the Ohio
made a running start for the first

seconds to spare. When she rounded

end of the course. "she had twenty-six

men came out of the hotel. They en
tered his hack and told him to 'drive
them to different saloons. He did so
and finally they ordered him to drive
to Golden Gate Park. When the hack
reached Stow Lake, 'Mignolet 'was
asked to stop and the two men, one of
whom* he recognized "as Armstrong,
stepped out. They dragged him from
his seat and commenced to beat him.
He broke away from them and ran
to the residence of Mr. Seville," the en
gineer at the pumping^statibn. Seville
telephoned to Golden Gate Park police
station and Policemen Foley and Man'

DIES SUDDENLY IX BED.'â Oakland. <Aug,
l.âJarnes Smith, 35 years old, a longshoreman,
died suddenly in bed tl;la morning at -his resi
dence, â¬51 Magnolia street. He- was- un
married. Tl'e Coroner will hold an Inquest.
Chief Wittman has decided to lessen
the territory now included in" the Cen
tral Police Station district. The num
ber of streets now patrolled is too
great for the men at the disposal of
Captain Duke. The new change will
be. made in a few days.
. It .is the. intention of the Chief to cut
Hyde and Leavenworth streets out
and include them in the City Hall Sta
tion district. By the recent creation
of a new police district in the Western
Addition, rrmde \by subdividing the
City Hall district, the latter district
has greatly decreased, so that Hyde
and Leavenworth streets can be in
cluded in it without' imposing- much
extra work on the district.
The number of men used on special
detail in the Central district is large,
leaving hardly enough patrolmen to
cover the regular beats. The central
district is the most important in the
city and Chief Wittman thinks that it
should, on account of the population,
be the smallest in area.
, The contemplated change has been
considered for some time. The new
central station district will be bound
ed on v the west by Jones street, north
by. Market, east by Sansome and north
by the bay. , â¢

Her answer to the suit is sensational.
Th.e meat of It is in .a paragraph in
which she says: "J. A. McMillen and
.his daughter, Lizzie B. McMillen, have
for years made it a practice to deceive
and swindle prospective purchasers of
lodging-houses, . and with the said
plaintiff Lizzie P." McMurray formed an
organized band of lodging-house

; Mrs. Packard .relates that she came
to San- Francisco in June from Bakers
fteld with $1000, which was all she had
to depend uppn for the support of her
self And her' mother. She was Intro-'
duced to one J. A. McMillen, who, she
says, represented that he knew her late
husband, who had done him a favor
which -McMillen would be glad to re
pay through the widow. Furthermore,
he .was a member of the sam'e fraternal
order as the deceased Packard. ' The
widow says she believed McMillen. He
had a lodging-house fpr sale and is
charged with hax'ing represented to her
that the place was rietting $75 a month.
She bought it and paid him $450 : cash
and gave her note for $525 and a mort
gage on the furniture. . After she took
possession of the house she found, she
says, that it paid no profit at all. The
note was assigned to the McMurray
Â¦woman and the suit begun.
t It has been called' to the attention of
the Superior Court th&t a "band" existB
in Sah Francisco for the purpose of
swindling, prospective purchasers of
lodging-houses. The charge was set
forth yesterday' in the answer of Mrs.

tee from the San Francisco .Chapter

to protest against themanner in which
the board purposed to ask for com
petitive plans for the new school

gramme as published was manifestly
unfair to. the architects and that such
a plan would result in keeping reput
able architects, out of the competition.
The matter was put over until next
Monday night and in the meantime
there is to be a conference between
the committee ot the board having the
matter in charge and the committee

Thirty days have elapsed since Jack
London, novelist and newspaper mart,
was served -with a complaint in his
wife's divorce action. Hr has made no
appearance, and - Mrs. Bessie London
is now entitled to* a- default judgment
against him. ' He was served with a
copy of the- complaint on board the
steamship Korea on June' 29, and yes
terday the time had elapsed in which
he is allowed by lawto file an answer.
It is not believed that there will be
any compromise. The nature of the
charges are such that it is thought that
London rail ill afford to contest them
in open court and that he will allow
his wife to 'get the divorce by default-
In the meantime, the property inteF
ests of the: pair have been settled out
of court. The restraining order served
upon London to keep him from drawing
any of His pay while in the Orient as
war correspondent or from any of the
publishing firms who have his books
for' sale has been set aside, the reason
stated for this ! action being that an
amicable settlement as regards prop
erty rights had been arrived at .be
tween himself and wife.

. We .must recognize, la "dtallng with .Queen
EHzabetb, that- the quality of the woman was
Jn accord .with the quality of her times, and
that during. her reign England rose to great
power.' 'I might say that .the portrait *of Eliza
beth's signing the dealh warrant which ac
companies this article is one of the- most of
fensively ridiculous portraits ever published
and "bears fto likeness to the -Queen.
Professor Steph'ens is giving a course
of ".lectures at the summer session on
'VThe- Reign of Queen Elizabeth."
Professor Stephens' defense was a re
pry to an attack on Elizabeth by Major
Mai : tin Hume, official collator of the
â¢.Elizabethan Btate papers for England,
whOi in- the August Harper's, impugns
..her character in an article entitled
'"Good Queen Bess." Here is what. the
professor said: .
Major Hume, in dealing with Queen Eliza
beth, forgets the fact that ehe was the. savior
of England and Is little enough to attempt to
'pass -Judgment, on. her from our modern ethical
code. Major Hume makes great capital of a
latter Klizabeth w.rot*' in 1088 to Sir Anthony
Â¦Pa-uLet. the' keeper of the Imprisoned Mary
Queen of Scot's, intimating that he .should do
away with that queen to save Elizabeth from
Â¦the. responsibility of . sfgnlng the death war
rant. Now. â¢ historians don't deal with ethical
.questions: â¢ That Is left for the theologians and
philosophers. The fact Is, that- for eighteen
years Elizabeth had suffered Mary Stuart to
live, .although in constant danger of Mary's
plots ag&lnbt Elizabeth's life. -And the fufther
fact Is that "Kli/.at-fth';*- contemporaries all
Â¦ hoped -end prayed- for the death of Mary Stuart
and madj; their crjtlcli'ni that she was allowed
tct live too long. '
.Professor H.- Morse Stephens de-i
fended Queen . Elizabeth to-day in his
classroom at^ the University of Cfali
fornia in a way that astonished his
students. As the champion of "Good
Queen Bess,". Professor Stephens de
clared-her. to have been the savior of
Englund, a woman of noble character
and patriotic aims â a .flirt, no doubt,
and not always scrupulous, but still
Â¦only a victim" of the quality of her
time.

in salaries and $107,1.12 02 in maleriai
and supplies. . , . â¢ â¢Â¦...'.. ;
Chiei Siillivah calls attentvon to the
fact that many of. the engine hoysfis
erected before the days of a paid dei
partment are ' entirely/unsuitable and'
suggests that. proper alterations -be:
made. The houses. : QCcupied by en--
Sines 5, $ and 24 are mentioned as. be
ing in very po<>r condition' and' it. '!Â»Â¦
recommended that new. ones be built.'
The Chief also advises that owing

mends the purchase of a light draught;
high power tug for the protection of

Revival of interest In the George
Washington memorial, for which
money was collected in California two
years ago. has resulted in the issuance
of a call by the local committee, Mrs.
Sarah D. Hamlin president, for a meet
ing to be held in Sorosis Hall at 1620
California street next Thursday after
noon at 3:30 o'clock.
The committee will receive and hear
Dr. Charles W. Needham, president of
Columbian University, who will speak
on the newly developed plans for the
George Washington University to de
termine the final disposition of the
building fund raised in California for
the George Washington ajemorial In
stitution and to decide the future
course and action of the California
branch of the association.
The revival of interest in the me*
mcrial is the direct result of the act
passed by the last Congress authoriz
ing the Columbian 'University to be
come the George Washington Univer
sity, which change of name becomes
an accomplished fact on September 1.
It is now purposed to revive the pro
ject of the George Washington me
morial and raise the money for the
main central building of the group of
buildings to be erected on the new site
which has been secured for the univer
sity in Washington, near the Wash
ington Monument, just south of the
White House grounds.

The wear and tear on ferry slips by huge
boats ts something we have all to ourselves,
for la New York there are no such exclusive
ferry vessels as those plying between San
Francisco and Oakland, none of the Eastern
boats being so large and heaâ â¢ . nor so attrac
tive in' aDoeara nee.
I was Impreysed with the fact, wherever I
went that San Francisco is better known than
ever before, and that people generally regard
this as a comins Rreat city on account" of Its
situation at the gate to the Orient. I noticed
this again at St. Louis, where I stopped off
to see the exposition. San Francisco's munic
ipal building there is the best of the group,
and California generally is attracting very fa
vorable attention. The exhibits of Northern
and Central California are particularly fine. It
goeÂ« without saying that Southern California
makes a good exhibit of her resources, for she
has sent men there who are experienced in
making the most of fairs. - ' '.*
BOATS HERE THE BEST.
Concerning wharf construction, the cylinder
concrete piers now common here are superior
to anything in the East. There are. however,
many solid stone or concrete piers in the Cast.
But In ordinary wharf construction and the
buHJinp of to-undations we are ahead. *he
Eastern ceoDle do not have the teredo and
limnorta to combat, as we have, and are
therefore less careful as to foundation work.
In the matter of rentals, I found that there
is no comparison between us. for accommoda
tions we afford for $15,000 a year cost JSO.000
in the big Eastern ports, and the lessees are
riven only an uncovered wharf. They are
obliged to build the superstructure themselves,
at a cost of perhaps $50.C0O to $75,000, and
this reverts to the city or State at the termi
nation of the lease. Our wharves in San
Francisco are generally larger, too, than
those of the East.
FAVOISS CONCRETE PIERS.
Our wharves are aa large and commodious,
and aa convenient to shipping as those ot the
big Eastern ports. I found, too, on comparing
rentals and taxes â that is. the raisins of rev
enue used directly tor harbor lmpro\ements â
that we have done as much- here as tfiere. Aa
to the handling of freight on the wharves. I
found that. in the Eastern ports the work Is
done more quickly, for the reason that Ilsnt
trucks and single teams are commonly uÂ«*d,
instead of the big fourrhorse trucks generally
In use here, and. which take up room and
move more slowly than lighter outfits. Frafsht
in the East is hurried off the wharves to ware
houses.
During his recent trip to the East
Charles H. Spear of Berkeley, presi
dent of the State Board of Harbor
Commissioners, made a special study
of the wharves of the ports of the At
lantic seaboard and the manner in
which freight is handled on the docks.
In comparing the conditions that pre
vail in the East with those at this
port Mr. Spear said:

contracts on hand. . * ...._

The powder works makes a- peculiar
pleading in Its contention that : it does
not and never did own a franchise. It
says that on the blank form submitted
by the Assessor the. line, for franchises
for corporations was filled- out as tax
able for $5000. but that the company
did not thereby concede its liability to
assessment for a franchise. Tfee item
was inserted in the form for the pur
pose, it is stated, of / avoiding litigation
with the city and county of San Fran
cisco concerning whatever sum might
be believed to be due for such taxes and
for the purpose of showinr the com
pany's willingness. to pay on a^ reason
able valuation of a franchise. The com
pany says that it had been paying taxes
on the $5000 basis for several years. :
As to the land which was advertised
for sale for the . delinquent franchise
tax, the answer of the powder works
avers that the Company transferred tho
property in November. W00. to the Ful
ton Engineering Company, and that thÂ«
latter corporation obtained the Injunc
tion against the sale, which has .sever
been dissolved. . . ;-.
The' first anawer to appear in thÂ«j
suits of the State -.of California, against
corporations for the collection of taxes'
on franchises was filed yesterday In the
Superior Court by the California Pow
der Works. This company's franchise
was : assessed at $250,000 and its entire
property at $558,450. .On its failure to
pay $4062 50 taxes on the franchise the
company's realty In San Francisco was
advertised for sale by the Tax Col
lector. An injunction, against the sals
was obtained and it has never been dis
solved.. â¢Â¦ Â¦ ' Â¦: Â¦"'.-..'.â¢Â¦ . ': 'â¢:..-'Â¦Â¦ 'Â¦ Â¦Â¦.
Judge Morrow said that he recog
nized the New Jersey decree as a suffi
cient reason for a permanent order and
decree of the court, and. that in so far
as it related to property in this dis
trict the Xew Jersey decree was ratified
and confirmed. Receiver Smfth, who.
was appointed special master in the
Eastern court, was also appointed in
the same capacity for this district.
The order requires the special master
to offer for sale, both separately and
as one piece, all the property of the
Union Iron Works, the sale to be made
at the front door of the main office of
the works. No bid shall be accepted
that is less than $1,400,000. and each
bidder before his bid shall be accepted
must file a certified check for $105,000
on a national bank, or $325,000 face
value of bonds secured by mortgage of
the Mercantile Trust Company, or in
case said mortgages shall have been
previously satisfied the bidders may de
posit $150,000 face value of the mort-.
gage bonds of the New Tork Security
and Trust Company.

The City Attorney was requested to
give an opinion as to whether the char
ter conditions prescribed as to publica

The. board gave a hearing on the as
sessment for constructing a sewer in
South Park. One of the protestants
claimed the assessment had been jug;
gled by the Hoard of Works, and that
the city should stand its portion of tht;
expense. The matter was referred to
the Street Committee. During the de
bate Otto turn Suden stated that the
city did not have a clear title to South
Park, although it had paid $20,000

Thv board passed to print the or
dinances prohibiting the sale of good!*
and merchandise on the ocean beach
between high and low water mark, and
also prohibiting gambling and the
erection of structures for gambling
purposes on the beach. Supervisor
Brandenstein explained that the or
dinances were re-enactments of laws
passed by the Park Commission in or
der to make them more binding, there
being some doubt as to who has juris
diction over the beach.
Lunstedt called attention to the
ittering of the beach with paper,
empty cans and other debris, and
thought some regulation should be in
corporated in the ordinance to remedy
the evil: but it was explained that the
Park Commission had power to pre
vent it.

Since the advent of the Russian* Vladivostok squadron
in the Pacific Ocean on preying purpose bent the big
liners that sail from this port to the Orient are carrying,
neither bullion nor money. This is a wise precaution if
the shipping companies intend to carry, contraband and
apparently useless if they intend to obey the neutrality
declaration of this Government. Commercial greed must
recognize, however, that the Czar has a very clear idea
of what constitutes contraband.

soldiers must be on their mettle to sustain the splendid

guardsmen have been put and in which they have been
found wanting. The regulars will have reason to look
to their laurels.

There is a Frenchman named Michel
Breal whose scheme, first broached In
18S6, is again being talked up. It con
sists of a- wholesale exchange, a swap,
ping of children from one family to
another.
Here is a Parisian father, in modest
estate, with a son. This man has an am
bition that his child shall have a thor
ough knowledge of German. The prop
er thing would be to place the child in
some German family for a while. But
the difficulty for the father is to dis
cover just the right sort of familyâ one
who would receive the child, one that
he could trust with the child and. above
all, one who had a child to swap. The
Parisian father would be spending no
extra money in housing the German
child and teaching it French while his
own was eating at a German table.
Meanwhile two nations * were under
standing each other better. It was a
splendid scheme, if only it could" be car
ried out. Â«
What was needed was a baby broker,

RUSSIA has struck a serious blow at American com
merce in the East. Its magnitude may be esti
mated when it is seen that the Pacific Mail Steam
ship Company and its allied lines are officially an
nounced to have largely ceased business on the Pacific.
Ocean by refusing cargoes to Japan, Korea, Manchuria
and Ncwchwang.
It will be recalled that at the beginning of the war
Secretary Hay proceeded to secure an agreement of the
nations protective of the integrity of China and of the
neutrality of her ports and territory. Russia gave a
halting and hypocritical assent to this and immediately
proceeded, by nagging at Peking and outrages upon
Chinese territory, to try to force that Government into
a resistance that could be called an overt act in breach
of neutrality. Russia having broken the Dardanelles
treaty by a ruse, in violation of international law having
sunk a British merchantman on the high seas, and hav
ing met with nothing stronger than newspaper criticism
has evidently concluded that she can safely defy the
peacefully inclined nations and while armed Japan is
whipping her legions inland she can safely sink unarmed
merchant ships at sea. v ' ; ' : >$-
Russia may be announcing her own downfall. in giving
to the world proclamation of her - piratical intentions
against commerce, and of her assumption of the right to
say what nations she will treat as neutrals and what as
belligerents. Napoleon exulted in his power and gloated
over his enemy when he wrote the Berlin decree forbid

alty of his vengeance. But Waterloo and St. Helena fol
lowed. In that decree, after all, he did only what Rus
sia is doing now. The only difference is that he was
open and bold about it and Russia has approached it
with her usual sinister sinuosity. The Berlin decree
supplied the British. Ministry with what it needed, an in-
THE INJURY TO COMMERCE.
Truant officers, seeking children under 14 years of
age, have made the startling discovery that many such
little ones who 'should be in school are employed in the
canneries and factories of this city. This fact may well
shock the community, and measures to punish the of
fenders as well as to remove the children to a proper
environment* would be greeted, with applause. Compe
tition in the struggle for existence has not yet reached
the stage" in San Francisco where child labor may be
accepted as a matter of fact.
Editor of The Callâ Dear Sir: I .saw
an editorial in to-day's Call on "Gluten
in Our Wheat," and it brought to mind
a Btorv of an old friend who had ex
perimented with wheat in the East
many years ago. He said he had tried
a number of acres to prove his theory.
It was to cut the grain in "the dough"
and*stack the sheaves grain down. It
was productive of a wonderful improve
ment in the wheat, but why it was not
adopted I do not know. If you can, use
this. I have tried to do my little bit as
far as I know. Any information I can
impart is at your service for the good
of the State. Yours truly. ;' r' i.

Port Arthur has fallen once more to the pen assaults
of the press correspondents. When the Eastern conflict
was in the interesting condition of being a newsless war
we had at least the satisfaction of doing our own specu
lating on what might happen. Now since the situation is
equally warless we are incessantly muddled by conjecture
and exaggeration, affirmation and denial that summarize
each day into nonsense. When Port Arthur falls the
correspondents will probably be home.
Every one is looking up or down at

CANDIDATE PARKER is preparing to speak. The
sphinx of Esopus is about to break the silence of
a lifetime. The news of the Judge's, contem
plated action may be a bit startling, but it must be true,
for the wires ha've borne to the four points of the com
pass the intelligence that Mr. Parker is engaged in the
preparation of his speech accepting the Democratic
nomination for the Presidency and that he will deliver
that speech on the 10th inst.
Along with this important announcement comes an
other to the effect that- his many visitors are interfering
with the Judge's work of preparation. This would seem
to indicate that if Mr. Parker is not wearying of posing
as the chief attraction of the Democratic circus he, at
least, would like a little more seclusion at this particular
time. He probably is humming to himself: "There are
moments when we wish to be alone; this is one of them."
But there is apparently no help for the Judge, who is the
whole show at the .now famous burg of Esopus, and
people will continue to "come miles to see" him, as they
did to behold the wonderful shoulder-blade of Gilbert
and Sullivan's vain and boastful Katisha.
Judge Parker might vary the monotony by inviting his
stream of visitors to join him when he takes his dip in
the waters of the Hudson, thus killing two birds with
one stone, if he does not succeed in losing votes neces
sary to the Democratic party through the drowning. of
members of his swimming parties. Or he might emu
late the example of the Republican standard-bearer, who
look Secretaries Morton and Metcalf out for a three
hours' 7aunt the other day and fatigued them so that it
is safe to say they 'will dodge another similar invitation.
The Judge could treat his ruralist neighbors to the
daily spectacle of wearing out his guests by hot-paced
journeys over the Esopus region. These strenuous
methods in all probability would have a discouraging ef
fect upon others contemplating a visit to the Democra
tic leaderr and who, would prefer to remain at home,
saying: "Not for us; we rather fancy the rest cure."
Candidate Parker then would have "time to burn" for
writing, revising and memorizing the speech that Dem
ocracy's hosts anxiously and palpitatingly await. The
last time the Judge was heard from was in that little
gold-lined message to the St. Louis convention. His
words were few, but the surprised party has not recov
ered even yet from the violent shock sustained by its
nerves. There is no way of prognosticating what new
shocks he will let loose from his surprise box in his com
ing effort. We can assert assuredly that the followers of
the party will listen with bated breath and such a tre
mendous silence will prevail in Democracy's circles that
the rest of the political world will be able to "hear a pin
drop" on August 10. when Parker speaks.

Another young San Franciscan has stumbled and fallen
in the path of honesty, and while the penitentiary is
waiting to receive another victim the gamblers of the
racetrack arc counting their profits and recording an
other triumph. It seems almost incredible that the
dupes of the bookmakers cannot understand the abso

have not the remotest hope of winning and in which

Between Brazil proper and French
Guiana there lies a territory known- a3
Counani, after the principal town there.
The. frontiers here had never been defi
nitely deliminated, but as the country
w as â¢ comparatively bare and savage
and of little commercial value the
question was left in abeyance and the
district became known as tbe, "contest
ed territory," and for a long while, in
deed, was the happy hiding ground of
the convicts eseaning from the. penal
settlement of French Guiana:
In 1E95, however, gold was discovered
and a rush took place, bringing the
country into prominence. It was under
these circumstances .that, the French
and Brazilian governments signed a
protocol to refer the question of fron
tier to the arbitration of Switzerland.
A decision rendered at Berne in De
cember. 1900, gave the country to Bra
zil, and immediately the Government of
Rio de Janeiro annexed it to the dis
trict of Para and put its administration
into due force. Since that time law
and order have been definitely estab
lished there, and the country enjoys
participation in the constitution of ttie
repubiic of Brazih I?!""'

The result of " the hard and fast rule will be dis
appointing. The men who enter the lands are already
the prospective victims of the limitations of the irri
gation law. It is planned upon/ the theory that the
same area' of iand will produce the same everywhere,
yield the same to support a family and to build up the
cquntry. The fantastic gentlemen who have invented
much 'of the literature of the subject in their visions
saw and said that the land irrigable by the Government
wotrid . support a population of 80,000,000; and in the
fine frenzy of prophecy they also extended over the
high plateaus, to the short season and cold winters of
the intermountain region, the 'physical facts of Califor
nia. They harvested innumerable crops of alfalfa in
their minds in regions where the rancher is in luck if
he get one, and they said and did V lot of things as
ridiculous as if they had said that irrigation would pro
duce flying pigs and rooting birds.
. Congress ' in its wisdom heeded them in_ their folly
and the area of a homestead entry in. an irrigated section
was reduced- so low that over much of the arid region
he must be a brave man who will undertake to support
a family on it. A low minimum is needed to make
good the dream of the number of settlers who will be
:drawn to the lands. With that low minimum and the
belief that a miner's inch .will serve 560 acres we have
the train laid for the explosion of a disappointment that
will sadly concern a great many people. If it be found
that a miner's inch will serve only 80 acres the owpers
of. a majority of the irrigated districts must give up.
But who will determine who shall surrender for lack
of water and who shall take what there is and do the
best, they can with it? . Â¦
It is said that the first cost of the water is to be
$20 per acre, which the settler has to pay to the Gov
ernment in installments annually, whether he get a crop
or not, or give up his land. After paying installments
enough years to prove that, the service units relied on
by the Government are idle dreams, and that a miner's
inch will not serve 500 acres, will the Government re
fund his money to the disappointed settler? No. Will it
permit him to sell to a man that is going to stay with
the proposition? No, for that is land monopoly, and is
offensive to a large number of atmosphere farmers who
believe that one acre of land, anywhere, is sufficient for
one family.
Let these things be remembered as practical guides:
The amount of water service varies with the character
of the soil and the kind of crop; the physical conditions
of California exist nowhere else, and the units of ser
vice here cannot be a guide anywhere else; there is no
hard and fast rule of water service applicable every
where,' and there is no common unit of area for a land
holding.
It will not prove to be conducive to the success of
Government irrigation that the scientific bureaus con
cerned in it are divided and scattered in more than one
department at Washington, and that the irrigation plants
arc being constructed and the money spent by men
who have never practically irrigated a square yard of
land, have never pl.ovred and cropped and reaped on
such land. . They are officials of the Inferior Depart
ment, the least practical of all the Cabinet departments)
while the soil men are in the Agricultural Department.
THE situation concerning irrigation is a bit hectic
and unwholesome. There is no doubt that the
Government works will be well constructed" and
that no expense will be spared to make them monu
ments of engineering skill and construction, but that is
a small part of it, as far as concerns the practical
irrigation of soil, that it may produce and support, homes.
The engineers in charge have long been known as pro
moters of the theory, "A miner's inch of water to 500
acres of land." That quantity may serve that area in
some localities.. In others it may be too much, but over
the vast majority of the area to be irrigated it is entirely
insufficient to serve any such acreage.
' It may be a sign of confidence, but surely is.no proof
of skill, to lay down a hard and fast rule of water
service. The amount of water that will serve an acre
of land depends upon the character of the soil and
subsoil, and if that were uniform all over the arid
region the effective service of water would be found to
depend upon and to vary with the kind of crop that is
grown. We have begun by admitting that there may be
places where a miner's inch' irrigates effectively 500
acres of land, but we have never seen such 2. place and
know df.no. one who has.
The resentment of the commercial nations may in the
end be taken advantage of by Japan in issuing letters of
marque and reprisal, which skilled mariners and sea
fighters will be found willing to take advantage of to
avenge their losses. The island empire will-be sure to
pursue her enemy by every means not forbidden .by in
ternational law and this is one of them. Though not re
sorted to for a time it is not outlawed and is far more
legitimate than the methods of Russia. *
In every struggle in which she has engaged Russia
has always dehumanized war. She has removed from it
the knightly quality which it first assumed in Southern
Europe and she carries that spirit of the brute beast
gone mad into every act.
flexible, bulldog public opinion that backed it to the end
and exulted with it over the disaster at Waterloo.
Russia's designs abroad may be judged by the charac
ter of her government at home, which is so bad that her
Ministers riae out in state and are brought back in gib
lets, blown into spatter by .their own people in resent
ment of oppression. Â¦ Â¦
The world will not long endure the aggressions of
such a power, with which there can be neither truce nor
treaty.
The question of free cargoes to neutral ports was set
tled by the United States- and Great Britain during the
Boer war. Cargoes of American flour consigned to a
neutral port in South Africa were seized by Great Brt-Â«
tain and were released on our protest. After that Great
Britain refrained from repetition of such interference
with our commerce.

..FRESNO, 'Aug.''!.â After two months
of strenuous .-effort to get the. raisin
growers, into line for the season,' the
.California Raisin Growers' Association,
through President R. K. -Madden, to
day, abandoned all efforts to preserve
the ass.ociatloh and announced that all
contracts so. far' signed would- be re
turned. This has been, brought *.abou(<
by the failure -of the association to
reach an agreement with the packers
and of growers to Join. -the association.
Every grower in the valley must now
do the best he can for himself without
aid from any organization whatever. It
is believed that- the result will be the
failure of many raisin growers.
The association has been in existence
for six years and has handled about
13,000.000 worth of raisins a year, rep
resenting 75,000 acres of grape land. The
low price of raisins last year caused the
downfall of the association.

spent half an hour with the strikers
around the packing plants at this
place. He was entirely unknown and
adopted this plan in order to learn the
true conditions regarding the necessity
of ordering out the State troops to
protect non-union men.
Together with a crowd of several
thousand strikers, Mickey saw a car
load of- strike-breakers unloaded and
sent into Armour's without molesta
tion of any kind. Afterward he vis
ited the houses and conferred with
their managers. Later he announced
he was well pleased with the true con
ditions which he thinks he discovered
and has refused to call out the militia".

John Carr, a carpenter, came, to Ne
braska City about three months ago,
from where no one seems to know. He
was a cocaine fiend, and between 7 and
8 o'clock this evening, while craved
from the effects of the drug, he entered
the corral at the German Hotel " and
shot Chris Hartman, the hostler, kill
ing him instantly. After killing Hart
man, Carr ran upstairs to his room and
began firing through the window. ' He
managed to hit a man named Baker in
the knee. Reloading his revolver he
dashed- downstairs and into the saloon
and began firing right and left. Paul
Hempel, a bystander, was shot in the
head, a dangerous if not mortal wound.
Officer Schoonover, who tried to catch
the murderous maniac, was shot
through the hand. ; Carr ran into the
street and encountered Officer Ingram.
A severe struggle ensued, in which Can
was mortally wounded. His death is
but the question of a few hours.

SPRINGFIELD, 111., Aug. 1.â Joseph
Letter's Commercial Company to-day
obtained a temporary Injunction pro
hibiting union miners from entering
upon its- property at Zeigler, 111., or
interfering in any way with the em
ployes.
Union Miners Enjoined.
The trouble started when .the police
went to the assistance of Frank Castel-
Jano, . a strikebreaker employed in the
stockyards, who had been dragged from
a street car and severely beaten. Be
fore the police could reach Ciistella.no
he had fired four shots from a revolver
at his assailants. One of the bullets took
effect in John Sheehan'a arm. The mob
became infuriated when they saw that
their companion had been â¢ shot. At
least a hundred men made a rush for
Castellano, but he was rescued .by the
police. . â¢ . *
The police station was only two
blocks away and Castellano was taken
there for safety. Seeing that their in
tended victim had escaped the rioters
determined to get revenge on the police
and .tried to wreck the station. Stones
and bricks by the hundred were hurled
at -the" building and all the windows in
the place were broken. Charge after
charge was made by the police and the
rioters were driven back only by the
strenuous use of clubs. These charges
by the. police had little effect, for as
soon as the police withdrew to the sta
tion the crowd would again gather
with a fresh supply of missiles and
make another attack on the place.
Nearly a. dozen times the police sal
lied forth and charged the crowd with
clubs before the rioters were dispersed.
In one of these charges three policemen
were injured with Â¦ bricks. At least
fifty rioters were cut about the head
In the hand-to-hand conflicts with the
police.

LOS ANGELES, Aug. 1. â Assistant
General Manager Hitchcock of the
Santa Fe system this afternoon stated
that the total loss to the company as
a result of the recent floods in Arizona
would be in the neighborhood of $100,
000. This amount, the company esti
mates, will be largely counterbalanced
by the returns received from the bene
fit to growing crops from the rain, and
to the Increase of the company's water
supply at several points along the line
In Arizona, nearly all of which had be
come exhausted by the long drought.

ST. LOUIS, Aug. 1.â In response to a
strike order issued by the president of
the Order of Railway Telegraphers,
with headquarters here, 450 telegraphers
employed by the Missouri, Kansas and
Texas Railway system stopped work
to-night. The strike affects the main
line and branches. The action of the
men is the result of demands for an
Increase in wages and certain other
concessions.

There are about 60,000 Idle men in
this district in consequence of the sus
pension.
Schuylkill region to-day was complete,
with the exception of the Lehigh Coal
and Navigation Company, which con
tinued to operate its collieries in the
Panther Creek Valley.
It can be said that the President will
not give the word to go ahead until he
is sure the Attorney General and his
assistants have the trust "cinched."
When that moment comes the Depart
ment of Justice will take action to have
the. packers brought, before the bar to
show why they should not be held in
contempt of the sweeping injunction
issued.
Ths 'President is hot planning this ac
tion because of the beef strike. He has
been awaiting for months the moment
when the evidence in process of collec
tion should warrant action.
CALL. BUREAU, HOTEL BARTON,
WASHINGTON, Aug. 1.â It is at the
beef trust's violation of the injunction
against illegal combination, issued by
Judge Grosscup â¢ in Chicago last year,
that the President is anxious to strike,
rather, than to intervene to settle the
beef strike: The indications are that
the day. for decisive action is not far
off. Just how far the administration
has adopted a definite programme of
attack and Just when the blow' will fall
is known to no more than two of the
President's advisers.
Although the Department of Com
merce and Labor~has had twenty differ
ent persons collecting data regarding
the beef trust's operations, it is de
clared that the department is not yet
ready to make a report to the Presi
dent. Nevertheless the j&eef trust's sus
pected violation of the Grosscup injunc
tion is understood to have been the
subject of at least one conference at
the White House last week, while Sec
retary Moody spent part of the week In
considering a mass of reports sent to
the Department of Justice. Some of
this came from representatives of the
Department of Justic^ In certain large
packing centers, while a part of it is
from agents of the Department of Com
merce and Labor.
The cattle have been followed from
the plains to the butcher by these
agents, who believe themselves to be
nearer the truth of the packing com
bine's operations than ever before. -
Special Dispatch to- The Call.
The strike and to-day's move of the
employers grew out of a series of dis
putes that promise to involve the em
ployers and the union men in the
building trades In another gigantic
struggle. The feeling is extremely bit
ter between the two ' sides a"nd both
have been preparing for the fight that
appears to be beginning. The employ
ers assert that if they are driven they
will declare war to the finish on the
unions and employ non-union men un
der an open-shop policy.
Philip Welnsheimer, president of the
Building Trades, who declared the
strike on the subway last week, is re
sponsible for. the strike to-day. The
reason given for calling out the. men
was a claim that the Fuller Company
has been using stone from non-union
quarries and trimming yards. In some
quarters it Is said that the actual rea
son for the strike was a fear that the
Building Trades Employers* Associa
tion would declare a lockout.
NEW YORK, Aug. 1.â The Building
Trades Alliance, made up *ot seven
unions, declared a strike to-day
against the George A. Fuller Construc

SAi< MATEO, Aug. l.->-Dlstric,t At
torney Bullock presented an ordinance
to the Board of Supervisors to-day
placing the most stringent regulations
on automoblling in this county. The

miles an hour on the main county
roads. All owners or drivers must
first obtain a permit from the County

plicant must show by affidavit that he
is a skilled chauffeur of at least two
months' experience; each vehicle must
carry a lamp in front and one on each
side at night, with the number painted.'
on the side lamps in four-inch letters;
all machines must slow down to six
miles an hour within COO feet of any
horse-drawn vehicle, and must stop on ,
sismal until the same has passed or
got out of the way. On mountain
roads 'machines must sound their sig
nals before turning a curve and must
stop within COO feet of any horse ve
hicle until the same has passed. A
maximum penalty of $500 fine or six
months' imprisonment is provided for
violation of the ordinance. The law
has been made necessary by the fre
quent accidents and many Instances of
speeding recently.

Members of the California
[ Viticultural Club \Talk
of the Wine Situation
During the sessions of the Calif or nia.
Vltlcultural Club now' being, held in
the lecture hall, of the- Mechanics* Li
brary a scheme may be evolved that
will increase the consumption- of Cali
fornia wines and. enrich- the State,- It
is the opinion of the members- of. the
club that grasping^ near-sighted
â¢wholesalers (or middlemen, as they are
called) are doing, more to injure' ithe.
wine industry of the State than all thÂ©
pests known to science: *... V .;
At yesterday's session of the. club,
after various papers of scientinc in
terest "had been read, the question of
the middleman was taken, qp. .It was
pointed out that wines from which the
grower should be paid at least 30'centa
a gallon for were being sold, through
necessity, to the middleman- for .from
18 to 20 cents a- gallon. Growers* fe
was also said, were glad to get $15 a
ton for grapes, when twice that figure
should prevail. ." â¢'.' . -i':
Notwithstanding these low" prices ths
consumers are compelled to pay. great
prices for their wines â not because thai
retailers demand .excessive" profit, but
because the wholesalers are noli, con
tent to reduce the margin of thejr gain.
It is to work their undoing that tha
club is striving, and when this is ac
complished another plan further to in
crease the consumption -of! California 1
wines Is purposed.- â¢ . Â¦ - - -. .. . .
An effort will be made to secure from
the authorities the right to open,, free
from license, resorts where- Calif brflla
wines alone are sold. Statistics . were
quoted showing that in wine drinking
countries drunkenness is- hardly
known. It is .the liquor traffle. it -was
asserted, that debased men. Placea
where pure wine was sold" exclusively
-would benefit the people as a whole.
Reference was made- to the low flarurs
at which, these- wines could be -sold-- at-'
a -profit. - . â¢ ....
The .question will be further :dhK
cussed at to-day's sessions.. . ' -.

The first half of the artillery prac
tice at Camp Atascadero was finished
yesterday, 450 shells in all having been
fired. Of these there was only one
which failed to explode, and the am
munition test is considered complate.
Three light batteries of artillery from
the Presidio have been engaged in the
practice, and a German moving spool
target has been used. This is somewhat
of an innovation In artillery practice
on the Pacific Coast, this being the
first one to be put in use.
Major Brown, commanding artillery,
stated that the second half of the prac
tice would be over before the rest of the
regulars arrive. The artillery has gone
before the rest of tha soldiers simply
for the purpose of having a free hand
for their practice.
The Engineering Corps of the army
have been a hard worked body during
the past week, but their efforts in one
line are now complete and they are
lying back on their oars. The main
feat to be encompassed was the laying
of water pipes throughout the camp,
in order that the soldiete might be pro
vided witl> % fresh water.
There are twp springs on tlie Rancho
del Encinal and these have been util
ized as reservoirs. A line of water
pipes runs through the entire drill and
parade ground, and cisterns have been
placed at regular intervals, so that,
each company will be provided with a
cistern. A number of zinc tanks have
been purchased and will be scattered
throughout the ranch, in order that
the soldiers will be able to fill their
canteens.
Adjutant General J. B. Loucks,
N. G. C. is in daily receipt of letters
from militiamen to the effect that they
will be unable to Join their regiments,
owing to the refusal of employers to
give them leave. Other guardsmen
cannot afford to lose two weeks' salary.
This state of affairs will make the at
tendance of the militia regiments
smaller than was expected.

Some alarm Was felt regarding

He did not report immediately to Gen

Never was the grand stand at the
racing park more brilliant than to
day. From a distance it offered a ka
leidoscope of color, ranging from lilac
to deep rose. While there was no
rush, as there has been in some former
years, there were very few vacant
seats from the edge of the bookmak
ers' ring to the- clubhouse and the per
centage of women was very large.
There were many of the social contin
gent present, including Doxholders and
their guests.
The chief interest of the day was, of
course, centered about the handicap,
and the paddock was thronged with
fair visitors before the race. When
this stake closed months ago the best
horses in the country were entered,
but the exigencies of racing played
havoc with this list. Even as rate as
Saturday it was thought that Hermis
and Waterboy would start, but with a
$50,000 engagement in front of them
on Saturday next it was deemed ad
visable to reserve them for that race.
There was a rumor that Hermis was
lame, but diligent inquiry elicited an
authoritative denial. Contrary to ex
pectations, also; only one three-year
old started. '
To-day's was the fourth running of
the Saratoga handicap and the gross
value of the stake was $12,000, of which
$9000 went, to the first horse, $2000 to
the second and $1000 to the third. Last
year it was won by J. B. Haggin'a
Waterboy, trained by A. J. Joyner,
and this year the same trainer handled
the winner. Lord of the Vale, for Aug

CHICAGO. Aug. 1.â Americano, an
added starter, won the rich Garden
City handicap, the feature of the open-
Ing of the Harlem summer meeting to
day. Clifton Forge, the favorite, was
second, and Gypzene, the extreme out
sider in the betting, was third. The
stake had a gross value of $3775, of
which $3175 ..went to the winner, which
is 1 owned by G. W. Baldwin & Co.
It was a desperate finish between the
first two, only a nose separating them.
The Baldwin colt had the favorite
pinned in on the rail all through the
final eighth of a mile, preventing
Knapp using his whip to the best ad
vantage, and tjils probably cost Clif
ton Forge the race. A claim of foul
was made by -Knapp, but was not al
lowed. The stake was riddled by
scratches, but this was partially offset
by three added startersâ Americano,
Big Ben and Beau Ormonde. t ; i
Gypzene, at 60 to 1, led her field to
the stretch bend, where Americano
took command. Clifton Forge had
raced third to tliis point, and, coming
through on the rail, hooked up with
Americano at the final eighth pole and
the two had it out hammer and tongs
to the wire. Gypzene had two lengths
to spare over Ananias for third place.
Jockey Henry was indefinitely sus
pended for a bad ride on Miss Inez.
Only two favorites won. The track was
a little slow, the weather clear and
warm and the attendance unusually
large. Summary:

the petition filed yesterday by Robert M.
Welch for letters of administration. McCeney
died on July IS at the age of 74, without
"wife, issue or parents." Surviving him are
two sisters one in Baltimore and the other
In New York. The estate, which might have
been worth $10,000 or more, is said to be en
cumbered by way of pledges for its full value.
The agitation in Panama started
Â¦with the retail shopkeepers, who feared
that they would lose the lucrative busi
ness of supplying the vast army of la
borers and officers who are to construct
the canal. The controversy has ex
tended rapidly, and the situation in
Panama now is stated to be really pre
carious from a political point of view.
WASHINGTON. Aug. 1.â Senor Obal
dia, the Panama Minister, called at the
State Department to-day and made a
formal protest against the corfstruc
tion given the canal treaty by the ex
ecutive oillcers of the Isthmian Canal
Commission. There is trouble growing
cut of the location of the postofllees in
the canal strip under the commission's
orders, but the most serious subject of
discord between the people of Panama
and the commission is the latter's lo
cation of a new customs port near the
city of Panama, The people of Pan
ama, contend that the commission's as
sertion of a claim to customs jurisdic
tion over outlying islands and harbors
will surely result in the total diversion
ot trade from Panama and will im
poverish that Government through the
loss of customs revenues.

ADVERTISEIMENTS.
A WONDERFUL CURE
OF RHEUMATISM
I tell you that when one is compelled
to stand on one"s feet mo3t of the day, if
there is any rheumatism in the system
it is pretty likely to show up in the feet.
AVell. this is what it did in my case. I
had suffered off and on with rheumatism
for a good many years. I took all kinds
of medicines. I rubbed all kinds of lini-
ments. My stomach became weak from
swallowing medicines, yet the rheuma-
tism kept on getting worse. Finally it
got into my feet and ankles. The feet
and ankles became swollen and painful,
so that I could hardly stand on them. It
looked as If I would have to give up my
position with the Domestic Sewing Ma-
chine Company; 1021 Market street,
where I have i>een employed for a good
many years. I did not wish to give up
my position, so I decided to take the
Electro-Chemic treatment, for I had
heard that this new treatment never
fails in rheumatism. I took the Electro-
Chemic treatment at the Institute, 118
Grant avenue, and in five weeks, at a
very little expense, I was thoroughly
cured. My name is Mrs. Mary Richards
and I live at 213 Shotwell street. Con-
sultation and examination free at the
Electro-Chemic Institute, and I surely
advise all sufferers to consult the Elec-
tro-Chemic specialists before taking
heaps of nasty medicines, which in all
probability will never cure them.

COMMERCIAL NEWS
Three bad little boys were before
Judge Fritz on a charge of riding bi
cycles over the greensward of Hamil
ton Square and thus making the grass
uninviting to good little boys who do
not own bicycles. His Honor frowned
so severely upon the defendants that
they were quite weepy when he stern
ly bade them begone and misdemean
no more.
For knocking out four unoffending
Chinese in Portsmouth Square one day
about a week ago Andrew Somers was
yesterday sentenced to six months' im
prisonment by Judge Fritz. The orig
inal charge was assault with intent to
commit murder, but it could not bo
made to adhere, so an accusation of
battery was substituted and easily
proved.
Judge Conlan expressed regret at his
Inability to sentence Becke Mario to a
longer term of imprisonment than six
months. Mario, a massive-framed fel
low, was convicted of having brutally
beaten his aged and infirm mother be
cause she was unable to supply him
with money to purchase drink.
"It would give me great pleasure to
send you to the penitentiary, where
they have facilities for the proper pun
ishment of human brutes." said his
Honor to Mario, who sullenly held his
peace.
William Alckley. proprietor of tho
San Rafael hack line, came over to
the city Sunday evening and at a late
hour dropped into a beer cellar on
Geary street, near Kearny. where he
was asked for alms by four men.
After giving one of them 50 cents
no lert the place and a few minutes
later discovered that his watch had
been stolen. His loss was reported to
Patrolman Dolan, who arrested John
A. Lane and Thomas Scott on Market
street, near Powell, and Aickley iden
tified them as members of the quartet
that had accosted him in the saloon.
A search of their clothing failed to
bring to light the missing timepiece,
but they were arrested and booked for
Rrand larceny and vagrancy. JudgÂ»
Cabanisa has set the hearing for next
Thursday.
Morris Schimetschek took his family
automoblling last Sunday and was en
deavoring to drive the machine up the
steep acclivity south of the Cliff House
when a mounted policeman arrested
him. When he pleaded ignorance of
the law he was dismissed with a brief
lecture by Judge Fritz.
But the lady wfts Inflexible. y "Ay
ban no fool." she replied. "Ay ban
goad wife toe yo\ Schwan. an' yo* no
ban goad hosban* toe may."
Then she told the court of how Swan
had acquired a nasty habit of getting
drunk and smashing the furniture in
their home at IZlhV* Mission street
and supplemented her story with a re
quest that he be given a term of im
prisonment long enough to enable him
to overcome his appetite for whisky.
The Judge inquired if three months
would be sufficient and when the lady
answered affirmatively that sentence
was pronounced.
Swan Johnson sat among the prison
ers In Judge Conlan's court and
through the bars tearfully beseeched
his wife, Hannah, to withdraw the
charge of battery on which she had
him arrested.
"Foar Gawd's sake, Yannah, let me
ouit," he blubbered.
ited a written document solemnly
pledging him to abstain from the use
of intoxicating liquid of any kind for
the period of five years from date.
And he did. About an' hour later he
appeared before the Judge and exhib-
"Don't remember you at all," was the
response; "and if you are telling me the
truth the greater shame is yours in be
ing, where you are to-day."
"It's the truth, all right," said Mr.
O'Hara rather dejectedly.
"Then for the honor of the old school
go and get one of the fathers to swear
you off drinking for a year.".
â¢"I'll make it five years," said O'Hara.
"We were classmates at St. Ignatius
School," said John O'Hara, charged
with drunkenness, to Judge Fritz, "and
you called me 'Jack* and I called you
'Al.' Do you remember the day we
licked those two fellowsâ"
John Murray was intoxicated when
he stole a horse and buggy' from W. ET.
Maher and drove the animal slap into
a ; Hyde street car, breaking one of its
legs. The horse was shot and killed by
a policeman, and John Murray was sent
to the Superior Court by Judge Conlan,
the charge being grand larceny and the
bail being fixed at $2000.
Mrs. Maggie Mann, who dwells on
Tenth street, was before Judge Ca
baniss on a charge of disturbing the
peace, and three of her neighbors. Mrs.
GallJe, Mrs. Drused and Mr. O'Donnell,
adduced testimony to show that the
charge was well founded. Never in all
Mrs. Drused's born days had she en
countered a more abusive tongue than
that possessed by Mrs. Mann, and Mrs.
Gallie would be very sorry if any per
son connected with her family would
utter such language as Mrs. Mann pro
duced with remarkable fluency. Mr.
O'Donnell confessed that he was not
easily shocked by words, but some ad
jectives employed by Mrs. Mann did
really harrow his sense of propriety.
The defendant did not have anything
to say in defense of the accusations,
and she was given until August 13 to
bring in counter-testimony.
- Oliver Peterson, mariner, not only re
fused to pay for a bottle of beer which
he hadn't ordered in a Pacific street
dance hall, but was engaged in demol
ishing the establishment when his ar
rest occurred. Dismissed by Judge
Fritz, who evidently attached more cre
dence to the uncorroborated statement
of the seaman than to the glib story of
his half-dozen accusers.
Mary Murphy, chronic vagrant, who
makes Columbia square her loitering
place, was given six months' Imprison
ment by Judge Fritz. The woman has
been arrested about half a dozen dif
ferent times for drunkenness in the
square.

Von Issendorff and his brother were
followed from yie Cliff House to their
place of business by a crowd of young
fellows, who pelted them with rocks
and sticks. Ere the shooting began Von
Issendorff's jaw was broken by a stone
thrown by one of his assailants. For
a time Sexton's life was despaired of,
the bullet having penetrated his abdo
men.
So the case was dismissed.
Percy Sexton, who was shot by Fred
von Issendorff, grocer, the night of
Sunday, July 10, at Page and Lyon
streets, mounted the witness stand in
Judge Conlan's court and declared that
he did not desire to prosecute the de
fendant, who did no more than he (Sex
ton) would have done under similar
circumstances.
. "I got what I deserved," said Sexton,
"and would like to have this case
dropped."
Frank McAndiless, charged with
having falsely represented himself to
be a policeman and threatening to ar
rest John Stanton and A. Hallber last
Saturday evening on Montgomery ave
nue, said he must have been dreaming
when he committed the alleged of
fense.
"I frequently dream that I'm a po
lice officer," said Mr. McAndiless, "and
in my sleep I've arrested any number
of people."
"Is the dream father to the desire â
do you yearn to wear a star?" inquired
Judge Conlan.
"It is my life ambition," was the an
swer.
"Well," commented his Honor, "there
is no accounting for some ambitions.
This case is continued till Wednesday."
Clerk Rice looked up the record of
the new man and whispered to the
bench that if authorities were desired
he would suggest "Napoleon's Book of
Fate."
Shipmates when afloat and room
mates while ashore, John Williams
and Frank Waters swore by each other
until last Sunday evening, when they
swore at each other. Thev did some
more swearing yesterday morning in
the court of Police Judge Fritz, where
John was accused of having attacked
Frank with deadlv weapons â to wit,
one knife and one pistol.
Frank swore that he had been drink
ing when he lay down upon the couch
Jointly leased by him and John in a
Howard-street lodging-house, and was
endeavoring to steal forty winks, when
John entered the apartment and
charged him with having stolen $10.
"Stow your gaff, mate," said Frank,
thinking John was joking. Disillusion
came when John called him several
kinds of thief, and when he attempted
to denv the impeachment John dis
played a knife and pistol and declared
that they would be put to use if he
was not given $10 right there and then.
To show that his threat was not idle
he slashed Frank's hand with the
knife. '
John's tale was quite different. He,
too, had been drinking, and was asleep,
he said, | when he was awakened by a
hand â subsequently identified as one
of Frank'sâ exploring the pocket in
which his cash was kept. He jumped
to his feet, and a hasty investigation
having satisfied him that he had been
robbed of a golden eagle he requested
Frank to restore the coin to its right
ful owner. Frank denied the theft,
and then, just to intimidate him, John
drew a little pocketknife, opened one
of the blades and remarked he might
utilize it as 'a means of enforcing his
demand. He had no intention to use
the knife, when Frank affrightedly
grabbed it and cut his handâ the same
hand that had pilfered the $10. Frank
then kicked up such a hullaballoo that
John, with a view to conserving the
peace, smote him on the face with a
fist. As for the pistol, it was never
drawn from John's pocket until a po
liceman abstracted It.
"It appears to me," said the Judge,
"that both of you gentlemen were so
heavily laden with liquor that neither
of vou has a clear recollection of what
did happen just prior to the arrest of
the defendant. Consequently I cannot
accept your testimony and must dis
miss the case."
Before leaving court John and Frank
shook hands most cordially and asked
the bailiff if he thought the Judge
would have time to go out and take a
drink or two at their expense.

The Chicago. wires over to R. Brent Mitchell
said: "It was a strong market throughout
and the close was etronp. Primary receipts ,
were very large. The. Northwest continued to
send complaints of damage by rust and were
conspicuous buyers In this market. There was ;
free profit-taking and there is a fairly liberal
short interest playing for a reaction. The :
market does not develop much selling pressure :
and the lack of it is due to the small stocks. â¢
We are not disposed to look for any large 1
profits on the short eide."
In this market futures were 2c higher on '
the morning session, with an active and ex- j
cited market, due to the advancing markets
Eart and the covering of shorts. The cash |

NEW YORK. Aug. 1. â The extreme dullness
of to-day's etock market was quite evidently
due t>> the closing of the I/ondon etock market
and was a testimonial to .the importance' at
tached to, that market as an index of inter
national political conditions. Hesitation and
disinclination to enter Into- new commitments
here with the Londori trading suspended were
the' dominant features of the local raarket, but
It was also evident that there was wanting
pressure cf liquidation on account of local con
ditions or on account of weak speculative
holdings of docks such as caused the reaction
oi last week. With money practically â¢ un
lendable on call, except at 1 per cent or be
low, there is no dear reason' why speculative
.holder* should be forced to liquidate, and they
peemed reasFured to-day about the maintenance
of the market value of their holdings. â¢ Slight
pressure to realise after the opening was ab
sorbed without difficulty and left the way
f'Pen for the creeping upward movement of
prices which followed. In this the Grangers
and Pacifies were the leaders. This was in
consonance with the weekly advices on the
conditions of railroad trafnc, which Officials
are in the habit of stating in interviews for
publication. These were quite uniformly en
couraging as to increasing traffic offering and
hopeful and even confident aa to the improve
ment In business sentiment and prospects for
fall business. The substantial Increase In net
earnings for June over last year reported by
tne Atchison was helpful to the movement.
The i-peeuiatlve mind did not eeem to be In
timidated by the prospect of loss of trans
pacific traffic owing to the announced refusal
of steamship companies to accept shipments*

CHICAGO. Aug. 1.â Reports or damage to
spring wheat by rust formed a decided Incen-,
tlve tor a strong wheat market here to-day.
At the close September wheat showed a gain
of l%SJ14c. Corn is up 9i!g*ic. Oats closed
!4Â©9ic higher. Provisions are practically un
changed.
At the opening an easier feeling was mani
fested. In the wheat pit as a result of favorable
weather and increased receipts, there being
considerable selling by pit traders. Initial
quotations on September were unchanged to
He higher at 90%9flOVie, and during the next
ton minutest the price declined to 8d'.<,c. The
market thMi took a r-uJden upturn, and for the
remainder of the sei-slon sentiment was de
cidedly bullish. A bis jump in corn prices had
unsettled -the traders who might otherwise have
been sellers, and all at once apparently every
one wanted to buy wheat and no one bad any
for Bale.' The *trenpth. however, did not all
come from sympathy with corn. Reports of
damace by rust continued to be received from
the Northwest, ami as these advices were ac
companied by go^-i buying orders pit traders
here changtd to the bull 6ide. Foreigners also
were free buyers throuKh commission houses,
the strength at Paris belns partly responsible
for this demand. M>re liberal primary receipts
anrt an increase in the visible supply, as well
as weakness of caf>h markets in the Southwest,
were bear factors seemingly totally Ignored by
the majority of traders. There was quite full
profit-taking during the latter part of the day
and prices continued to advance. ThÂ« market
closed at practically the highest, point. â¢ After
touching lil'&c September closed at 01?i@
91Tic.
The principal influence affecting the corn
market was a report that the Roumanian crop
had been destroyed by drouth, and that the
Government had prohibited the exportation of
corn. September closed a Â«c higher at 5lc.
Influenced by the strength of wheat and corn,
the oats market wris firm, September closing
3*c hishor at 33%@334c. i
Provisions were easier as a result of moder
ate exiling by brokers supposed to be for the
account of local packers. A 20-cent break in
the price of hogs also tended to depress prices.
At the close September pork- was down 24'&5c,
lard was off 24c and ribs closed 24@5c
lower.

Receipts or deciduous K^uits were lighter
than usual and top quality Â¦ offerings showed
more steadiness under a good Io<i~al and export
demand, but supplies were well upÂ« to require
ment^ and prices had but slight 'VT'U-lance.
Peaches in small boxes cleaned up better than
on Saturday and occasional sales of selected
parcels of the best shipping stock coramsk"Â»ded
a premium, some fancy Crawford* selling 'fcl"
to 65c per box. Large boxes, however, were',
weak, as Saturday's belated arrivals had to
be sold at low prices, and this had" a depressing
effect on the eale of good fruit. There was
continued easiness in Apples, supplies being
far in excess of the demand, while good Apri
cots in bulk were steady. The canners were
still purchasing Bartlett Peara on the wharf
at the familiar quotations, but they were
practically cut of the market for other fruits.
Melons were plentiful, but prices held up well,
while GrapeÂ» continued to drag, as general of
ferings lacked sweetness and were otherwise
poor. There were no Longworth Straw'berrtes
received, but the other varieties arrived freely
and met with a good demand at previous
prices. Blackberries were firmer, there being '
none received from Sebastopol. Huckleberries
were more plentiful and sold at a lower range.
Cltrusi fruits were generally inactive and prices
were nominally unchanged. Two carloads of
Central American Bananas came in, but other
wise there was nothing new to report in Tropi
cal fruits.

NEW YORK Telephone Broad 31TT.The "cotton-tail" deer at the Chutes
has changed its habits and tempera
ment since November 23 of last year,
according to the declarations of Jo
seph F. Gillin. who on the date men
tioned was nipht watchman at the re
sort. The deer Jumped from its pen
and assaulted him viciously, according
to a complaint which Gillln filed yes
terday in the Superior Court.
In its sport the cotton-tail found
satisfaction in breaking the watch
man's arm and bruising his hand and
wrist, the injuries incapacitating him
from the performance of manual la
bor.
Gillin says that the railing which
confined, the deer was only three feet
nine inches high, whereas to keep it
from doing battle in the zoo the fence
should have been five feet six inches in
the clear. He contends that the
Chutes Company is responsible for the
low railing and therefore should pay
him for the damage he suffered in
conflict with the pet.

Corinne A. Bartlett yesterday sued
for divorce from Ward S. Bartlett on
the grounds of intemperance, neglect

Honolulu on December 17 'of last year

Campbell and Johnson, the comedi
ans of the Zarrow trio of bicyclists
who recently made such a hit at the

bounded hilarity at both performances.
Charles P. Lowe, the xylophone virtu

pretty character dancer, were also new
and scored successes, and James T.
Dervin, a mimic and ventriloquist, re
appeared after a long absence with a

Rice and Cady clung to their German
make-up and presented a lot of new
nonsense, and Bobby North abandoned
his Hebraic disguise and made a hit
singing cocm songs and burlesquing a
burlesque star. Dorothy Morton had a
cold, but her voice was good enough to
compel recalls of every number she
sang. Nora Bays relinquished her
Teutonic character and gave some
clever vocal imitations, her singing of
"Down Where the Wurtzburger Flows"
bringing more encores than she had
verses to respond with. There was a'
great deal of Edwin Clark in varied
character, and Ben Dillon also showed
versatility.
That the new Flscherites have al
ready established themselves as prime
favorites was exemplified by the rous
ing reception that greeted each initial
entrance of a principal. The floral
tributes were numerous and costly and
the usual first-night oratory was hap
pily omitted.
To the invisible gentleman who
stages the productions of Fischer's

piece is the most pretentious ever put
forth in the O'Farrell-street home of
burlesque, and in that respect, as well
an several others, its attractiveness
will be enhanced by the pruning that

At last night's meeting, which was
called by the Forty-first District Re

presided in the absence of President
L. S. Beedy. A. K. Daggett was called
upon to read the report of the com

Kirke La Shelle's new and fasci
nating heroic drama,"Sergeant James,"
was seen for the first time in San Fran
cisco last night at the Central Theater,
and thrilled and delighted a big house.
The scenery and scenic effects are
elaborate, embracing a cavalry camp,
with troopers, horses and accoutre
ments, and a wildly picturesque view
of the rugged mining regions of Mon
tana. The sensational climax of the
third act has powerful dramatic in
tensity, and it stirred the audience to
tremendous enthusiasm, which brought
numerous curtain calls. Juliet Crosby,
specially engaged for this week at the
Central, was charmiing as the heroine,
and received frequent and flattering ap
plause and floral testimonials. Her
schel Mayall, in the title role, gave an
able, manly and convincing imper

FOR PRIMARY
SACRAMENTO, Aug. 1. â After a
consultation with Acting Governor
Alden Anderson. State Horticultural
Commissioner Ellwood Cooper to-day
announced the appointment 6f Edward
Ehrhorn of Mountain View, Santa
Clara County, to succeed Alexander
Craw as quarantine inspector at San
Francisco.
A number of candidates had been
announced for the position, which pays
$200 a month, but Ehrhorn was chosen
because he was regarded as being pe
culiarly fitted to perform the duties of
the office. He is at present the Horti
cultural Commissioner of Santa Clara
County and was highly recommended
to the position by the fruit growers of
the Santa Clara Valley.
He is a noted entomologist and has
for some time assisted Craw in his
work at San Francisco. Ehrhorn will
assume his new position in a few days.
as Craw will leave about the middle of
the month to fill a position* in the Ha
waiian Islands similar to the one he
leaves here.

company acquitted itself creditably.
White Whittlesey found the ultra he

Expert Cyril Williams filed with the
Supervisors' Finance Committee his
report on the cost of horseshoeing in
the Fire .Department. After present
ing a mass of figures, he says that the
city itself can. do the work for less
than the contract just let to Edward
Graney at $2 50 per horse. During the
fiscal year ending June 30 Williams as
certains the cost of horseshoeing was
$5SSS 47, and he figures that the cost
at the contract rate would have been
SC604 50. From 1893 to 1900, at the con
tract rate of $2 50, the expert finds the
cost to be for each horse $2S 08 per an
num. For the year 1900-01 the contract
rate was reduced to $2, and the cost
l>er annum was $19 37. For 1903-04,
when the city shod the horses, the cost
was $19 43.
The Finance Committee receded from
its determination to subpena the Fire
Commissioners to explain their action
in awarding the horseshoeing contract
at an alleged higher rate and also to
explain the increased cost of the Fire
Department stables. No subpenaes
were issued and none of the Commis
sioners were present.
Another proposed amendment to the
charter, providing that the Tax Col
lector shall not have the right to ap
point an attorney to conduct the liti
gation of his oftlce. which shall become
part of the duties of the City Attorney,
was referred to the City Attorney for
an official opinion.
J. P. Martin, manager of the Sharon
estate, informed the Finance Commit
tee that in two weeks he would have
installed on all the estate's sidewalk
elevators a Safety device which his en
gineer is perfecting. Martin filed a
petition to amend the ordinance with
regard to the locking of the elevator
doors from the sidewalk. This was re
ferred to the Fire Committee.
"Inasmuch as the Board of Super
visors now makes contracts for the
Police, Health, Public Works and
Electricity departments, there appears
no substantial reason why the Super
visors should not have like powers in
respect to the Fire Department. We
are convinced that the change would
result in economy to the city and
county." i
The Board of Supervisors yesterday
adopted a resolution providing for the
submission to the electors of a pro
posed amendment to the charter de
signed to take away from the Fire
Commission the power to award con
tracts for supplies and placing that
power In, the hands of the Supervisors.
The amendment would repeal section
4. chapter 2, article IX. The report
of the Charter Amendment Committee
says:

S\VEETHEART E" PRISON
The old guard acquitted themselves
nobly. All too little is there of John
Dv.nsmuir's great basso â he is, of
courre, the Toreador. Kate Condon in
skirts â a I'espagnole â is even more
charming .than Kate Condon in tights
an Alan-a-Dale. Her part is a la
Carmen, and she does it in a fashion
to arouse. lively curiosity as to a pos
fible Condon Carmen. Miss de Fillippe
Li excellently cast. Her voice seems
to Ket better and better, and her acting
us the girl husband is most felicitously
funny. Â¦V/illard Sims is scrumptious as
an English milord, and every one else
help?.
It Fhould be said that "The Toreador"
is delightfully staged.
BLANCHE PARTINGTON.
Mejville Ellis has not much to do,
but is sufficient. His is the skill, how
ever, that has assisted -Ferris Hart
man in the splendid stage management
of the piece. Miss Carrie Reynolds
dances and dances. "What there is of
'sing" in the new soubrette is pleas
ant, but there is not much. She is
pretty, however â and dances. She
has in fact a heel of Mr. Kennedy's
virtuoso alertness. Mis3 Young is pleas
ing in a somewhat colorless fashion,
but opportunity was small, and opin
ion mav well wait.
Much cry and little wool? No, though
"The Toreador" is not another "Robin
| Hood" â that Kimberly of comic opera.
Â¦ And the cast is a Jeweled one. The
j Tivoli has spread stars on the piece in
I princely fashion. There is a new sou-
I brette, Carrie Reynolds; a new so
prano, Mary Young; a new leading
man, Melville Ellis; a new comedian,
; John J. Kennedy; besides "light opera's
De Reszke," John Dunsmure, with Wil
lard Sims, Teddy Webb, charming
! Kate Condon. Miss de FilliDpe, Bessie
Tannehill and other old favorites. One
gets in truth hardly enough of any, Â«6f
; them but Webb. There is a sniff/ of
; one, a sip of another, a crumb ofj an
other and a general wish for mo:re.
One doesn't always wish for Xnore of
"The, Toreador." Its mapfy hands
might have made shorter v.ork of the
second act, for example. There is a
band that suggests derxd cats for a
helpless moment or fwo, a Spanish
village band that we>.comes the false
toreadors. Half of If; would be twice
too much: The r^st is funny. Here
is where Ted/*iy Webb, cast as
the false toreador, runs over.
I do noV remember Mr. Webb
anywhere better cast, but . his
best e.ffort here cannot save the
scene/. Perhaps, like Chinese tea, the
hu/slor on't has lost flavor through
f uming over seas. Emphatically, how
â¢ ever, the rest 'fas not. The comedy is
; better by a plot than most of its neigh
j bors, and on the whole is engagingly
: entertaining. There is a mild Spanish
1 flavor to the music, some lyrics that
1 stick anil a couple of excellent ensem
bles. - â¢
j The performance, howeverâ well, it
i was simply another stake in the Tivoli
! comic- opera corral. I do not remember
I another given by visiting genius better
; or perhaps so good. In, say three days,
i it will be better; the snap and fit of the.
1 thing, that come only with the trying
j il upon the audience, will be there. But
Â¦ smoothness, style and distinction were
delightfully in evidence from the work
of the smallest maid in the chorus to
Kate Condon. The new people are pleas
ing, but not astonishing. John P. Ken
nedy sings more in Fischer than Tivoli
fashion, but he has a coloratura heel
that found every rib in the audiences In
; fact, as a comedian Mr. Kennedy has
; distinctly arrived.
Last night the Tivoli grave us the
"first production In San Francisco of
the renowned London and New York
musical comedy sensation, 'The Torea
dor,' written in two acts by James J.
Tanner and Harry Nichols; lyrics by
Adrian Ross and Percy Greenbank;
music by Ivan Caryll and Lionel
Monckton; produced under the general
direction ol W. H. Leahy; under the
musical direction of Paul Steindorff;
under the stage management of Ferris
Hartman, assisted by H. Melville
Elli3." Amen! ~ . :

â¢* Miss- Whittaker, a prominent
dub woman of Savannah, Ga.,
tells how she was entirely cured
of ovarian troubles by the use
of LydiaE. Pinkham's Vegetable
Compound.
Dear Mus, Petcham: â I heartily
recommend Lydla E. Pinkhani's
Vegetable Compound as a Uterine
Toaic fi.ncT Regulator. I Buffered for
four years with irregularities and
Uterine troubles. Kb one Â«but those
who have experienced this dreadful
agony can form any idea of the physi-
cal and mental riisery those endure
who are thus adicted. Your Vege-
table Compound cured me within
three months. I was fully restored to
health and strength, and now my
periods are '. regiilar and painless.
What a blessing it is to be able to
obtain such a remedy when bo many
doctors fail to help you. Lydia E.
Pinkham's Vegetable Compound
it better than any doctor or medicine
I ever had. Very truly yours, Miss
Exbt Whtctakeb, 604 39th St, W.
