And yet his Lrst action, when the door

agciril the table, whence he slipped

it was for this reason that the Duke
desired to send him to my establish
ment. In a fortnight the boy was quite
at home with. us. and was apparently
absolutely happy.
"He was leet seen or. the night of
May â that Is, the night of last Mon
day. His room was on the second floor,
and was approached through another
larger room, in which two boys were
eU*niaz. These boys saw and heard
nothing, so that It is certain that young
J3*utre did not pass out that way. His
window was opes, and there is : a stc-jt
Ivy ; plant ; leading to the ground. We
could trace no 'footmarks below, -but it
is sure that this â¢is the only possible

"His absence was discovered .at 7
o'clock on . Tuesday .morning. His bed
had been slept* in.' He had dressed him

school suit "of black Eton Jacket and

was on the second floor, at the farther

been slept in, but he had* apparently

shirt and socks were lying on the floor.
He had undoubtedly, let himself down
by the ivy, for we could see the marks
of his feet where he had landed on the
lawn. His bicycle was kept in a small
shed beside this lawn, and It also was
gone. , -

he had gone back to his father, but
nothing had been heard of him. The
Duke is greatly agitated, and, as to me,
you have seen yourselves the state of
nervous prostration to which the sus
pense and the responsibility have re
duced me. Mr. Holmes, if eve:
put forward your full powers, I implore
you to do co now. for never in your life
couid you have a case which is more
worthy of them."
Sherlock Holmes had listened with
the ucmos: rhe statement
i?f the unhappy schoolmaster. His
drawn brows and the deep furrow be
tween them showed that he needed no
exhortation to concentrate aB his atten
tion upon a problem which, apart from
the tremendous interests involved, must
appeal so directly to his love of the
complex and the unusual. He now drew
out his notebook, and jotted down one
or two memoranda.
"You have been very remiss in not
coming to me sooner," said he,-Â«evere
ly. "You start me on my investigation
with a very serious handicap. It is in
conceivable, for example, that this ivy
and this lawn would have yielded noth
ing to an expert observer."
"I am not to blame. Mr. Holmes His
Grace was extremely desirous to avoid
all public scandal. He was afraid of
his family unhappiness being dragged
beiore the world. He has a deep horror
thing of the kind."
"But there has been some official in
vestigation?"
"Yes. sir. and It has proved very dis
appointing. An Apparent clew was at
once obtained, since a boy and a young
man were reported to have been seen
leaving a neighboring station by an
early train. Only last night we had
news that the couple had been hunted
down in UTorpooC and they prove to
have no connection whatever with the
matter ie hand. Then it was that In
despair and disappointment, after a
eleeplese night. I came straight to you
by the early train."
I suppose â¢â¢ - local investigation was
relaxed while this false clew was being
followed up?"
"It was entirely dropped."
"So that three days hayÂ« been
wasted. The affair has been most de
plorably handled."
"I feel it, and admit it."
"And yet the problem should be ca
pable of ultimate solution, I shall be
very happy to look into it. Have yon
been able to trace any connection be
tween the missing boy and this Ger
man master?"
"None at aU."
Was he in the master's class?"
"No. he never exchanged a word with
him, so far as I know."
"That is certainly very singular. Had
the boy a bicycle?"
"No/
'"Wars any other bicycle missing?"
"No."
"Is that certain?"
"Quite."
"Well, now, you do not mean to seri
ously suggest that this German rode off
upon a bicycle in the dead of the night,
bearing the boy in his arms?"
"Certainly not."
"Then what Is the theory in your
mind?**
'The bicycle may have been a blind.
It may have been hidden somewhere
and the pair gone off on foot."
"Quite so, but it seems rather an ab
surd blind, does it not? Were there
other bicycles in this shed?"
" Several.**
'Would he not have hidden a couple
had he desired to give the idea that
thej' had gone off upon them?"
*"I suppose he would."
"Of course he would. The blind the
ory won't do. But the Incident is an
admirable starting-point for an inves
tigation. After all. a bicycle Is not an
easy thing to conceal or to destroy.
One other question. Did any one call to
see the boy on the day before he dis
appeared ?"
"No."
"Did he get any letters?*
"Yes, one letter."
"From whom?"
"From hi? father."
"Do you open the boys' letters?"
"No."
"How do you know It wu from the
father?"
<j rhe coat of arms was on the en
%-elope, and it was addressed in the
Duke's peculiar stiff hand. Besides,
the Duke remembers having written."
"When had he a letter before that?"
"Net for several days."
"Had he ever one from FranceT*
"No, never."
"You see the point of my questions,
of course. Either the boy was carried
off by force or he went of his own free
wilL In the latter case, you would ex
pect that some prompting from outside
would be needed to make so young, a
lad do such a thing. If he has had no
visitors, that prompting must have
come in letters; hence I try to find out
who were his correspondents."
"I fear I cannot help you much. His
only correspondent, so far as I know,
vas his own father."
-Who wrote to him on tfcs> very day
A. CONAN DOYLE
of his disappearance? Were the rela
tions between father and son very
friendly?"
"His Grace is never very friendly with
any one. He is completely immersed in
large public questions, and is rather in
accessible to all ordinary emotions. But
he was always kind to the boy in his
own way."
"But the sympathies of the latter
were with the mother?"
"Yes."
"Did he say so?"
"No."
"The Duke, then?"
"Good heavens, no!"
"Then how could you know?"
"I have had some confidential talks
with Mr. James Wilder, his Grace's
secretary. It was he who gave me the
information about Lord Saltire's feel
ings."
"I see. By the way. that last letter
of the Duke's â was it found in the boy's
room after he was gone?"
"No, he had taken it with him. I
think, Mr. Holmes, it is time that we
were leaving for Eugton."
"I will order a four-wheeler. In a
quarter of an hour we shall be at your
service. If you are telegraphing home,
Mr. Huxtabie, it would be well to allow
the people in your neighborhood to im
agine that the inquiry is still going on
in Liverpool, or wherever eiae that red
Jierrin*- led yojir pack. In the mean
time I will do a little quiet work at
your own doors, and perhaps the scent
is not so cold but that two old bounds
like Watson and myself may get a sniff
at it."
That evening found us in the cold,
bracing atmosphere of the Peak coun
try, in which Dr. Huxtablea famous
school is situated. It was already dark
when we reached it. A card was lying
on the hall table, and the butler whis
pered something to his master, vrho
turned to us with agitation in every
heavy feature.
"The Duke is here." said he. The
Duke and Mr. Wilder are in the study.
Come, gentlemen, and I will Introduce
you."
I was, of course, familiar with the
pictures of the famous statesman, but
the man himself n-as very different
from his representation. He was a tall
and stately person, scrupulously dress
ed, with a drawn face, and a nose
which rras grotesquely curved and long.
His complexion was of a dead pallor,
which was more startling by contrast
with a ior*- dwindling beard of vivid
red, which flowed down over his white
waistcoat, with his watch chain gleam
ing through its fringe. Such was the
stately presence who looked stonily at
us from the center of Dr. Huxtable's
hearthrug. Beside him stood a very
young man, whom I understood to be
Wilder the private secretary. H* was
small, nervous, alert, with intelligent,
light blue eyes and mobile features. It
was he who at once, in an Incisive and
positive tone, opened the conversation.
"I called this morning. Dr. Huxtable.
too late to prevent you from startler
for London. I learned that your object
was â to invite Mr. ' Sherlock Holmes â to
undertake the conduct of this case.
His Grace is surprised. Dr. Huxtabl*.
that you should have taken such a step
without consulting him."
"When I learned that the police had
failedâ
"His Grace is by no means convinced â 
that the police have failed." .
"But surely. Mr. Wilderâ 1 *
"You . are well aware. . Dr. Huxtabie.
that his Grace is particularly anxious
to avoid all public scandal. He prefers
to take as few . people as possible into
his confidence."
"The matter can be easily remedied,"
said the brow-beaten ' doctor: "Mr.
Sherlock -Holmes can return to London
by the morning train."
"Hardly that, doctor, hardly that."
said Holmes, in his blandest* voice.
"This northern air is Invigorating and
pleasant, so I propose to spend a few
days upon your moors, and to occupy
my mind as best I may. Whether I
have the shelter of your roof or of the
village inn is, of course, for you to
decide."
I could see that the unfortunate doc
tor was in the last stage of indecision.
from which he was rescued by the deep,
sonorous , voice of the red- bearded -
Duke, which boomed out like a dinner
â â¢w
-I agree with Mr. Wilder. : Dr. Hux
table. that you would have done wisely
.to '"consult me. But since Mr. Holmes
, has already been taken into "our confi
. dence, it:, would indeed be absurd that
we should not avail ourselves of his
services. Far from going to s the inn.

"I thank your Grace, far the pur

" would be wiser for me to remain at the
scene of , the : mystery." ':'-â  . ..
" - â¢ "Just 'is . you like. Mr. . Holmes. Any
Information which Mr. , Wilder or I can j
give you is. of - -se. at your disposal.** "~
"It will probably be necessary for me
to see you at. the Han.** said Holmes.
"I v " uld only ask you now. sir. whether
yoc have formed any explanation in
your ; own mind as to the mysterious
disappearance of your son?"
"No. . sir. I have not."
"Excuse me if I allude to that which
is -, painful to you. but I - have no al
ternative. Do you think that * the
Duchess had anything to do with the
matt-r?"
â  The great Minister showed percepti
ble hesitation. ." ,
"I do not think so." he said, at last.
"The other most obvious explanation
is that the child has been kidnaped for
the purpose of levying ransom. You
have net had any demand of the sort?"
**Nb. sir."
["One more â â¢*tion, your Grace. I
understand that you wrote to your son
upon the day when this incident occur
red " . jpQpÃ|f6HJ|
"No, I wrote upon tbÂ» day before."
"Exac .ly. But he. received it on that
day?"
-Tel
"Was there anything in your letter
which might have unbalanced him or
induced him to take such a step?"
"No. sir. certainly , not."
"Did you post that letter yourself?"
The nobleman's reply was interrupted
by his secretary, who broke in with
some heat. . ' Â« . *
"His Grace is not in the habit of
posting letters himself." said he. "This
letter , was t laid with others upon l the
study table, and I myself put them in
the ~ post-bag.**
"You are sure this one was among
them?"
"Yes. I observed it." ,
- "How many letters did your, Grace
write that day?"
'Twenty or thirty. I. have a large
correspondence-- â  But surely - this la
somewhat irrelevant T'
"Not entirely, " said Holmes.
"For my own part." the Duke con
tinued; "I have advised . the police to
turn their attention to the South of
France. I have already said that I do
not believe that the Duchess would en
courage so monstrous an action, but
the lad had the r most wrong-headed
opinions, and it is possible that he may
have 1 fled to her, Â» aided and abetted by
this German. I â¢ think. Dr. Huxtabie.
that we will now return to the Hall.
I could i see : that there were other
questions 'which Holmes would have
wished to put, but the nobleman's ab
rupt manner showed that the interview
was at an end. It was evident x that to
his f Intensely aristocratic nature this
discussion of - his t intimate , family . af
fairs with a stranger was most abhor
rent, and that he feared lest every fresh
question would throw a .fiercer light
Into the 'discreetly shadowed corners of
his ducal history.
When the nobleman and his secretary
had;lrft, try' .friend â¢luna; v Â»ms#!f at
once with characteristic eagerness into
the investigation.' .
The boy's chamber was carefully ex
amined : and , yielded nothing save the
absolute " conviction that it t was only
through the window that he could have
escaped. The German master's room
and ".effects gave no: further clew. In
his case a trailer" cf Ivy had given way
under his weight, and we saw by the
light nof a lantern . the mark on the
lawn where : his heels ' had come down.
That one dint in "- the short, green grass
. WO3 " the â¢ only â¢ material witness left of
this â¢inexplicable nocturnal flight.
; -Sherlock Holmes left the house alone,
and only returned after, 11. He had ob
tained* a large ordnance map :; of the
neighborhood, and this he brought into
my room, where he laid it out on the
bed. and. having balanced the lamp in
the middle of it. he began to â  smoke
over i it, and occasionally to point oatobjects of interest with the reeking
amber of his pipe.
"This case grows upon me, Watson,"
said he. "There are decidedly some
points of interest in connection with it.
In this early stage, I want you to real
ire those geographical features which
may have a good deal to do with our
investigation.
"Look at this map. The dark square
is the priory school. I'll put a pin In it.
Now, this line is the main road. You
see that it runs Â«ast and west past the
school, and you see also that there is
!:O side road for a mile either way. If
these two folk passed away by road, it
was this road."
"Exactly."
"By a singular and happy chance
v c are able to seme extent to check
what passed along this road during the
Right in question. At this point, where
rry pipe is now resting, a county con
stable was on duty for 12 to 6. It is,
as you perceive, the first crossroad on
the east side. This man declares that
he was not absent from his post for an
instant, and he is positive that neither
boy nor man could have gone that
way unseen. I have spoken with this
policeman to-night and he appears to
me to be a perfectly reliable person.
That blocks this end. We have now to
deal with the other. There is an Inn
here, the Red Bull, the landlady of
which was ill. She had sent to Maxk
ieiot* for a doctor, but he did not ar
rive until morning, being absent at
another case. The people at the inn
were alert all night, awaiting his com
* ing. and one cr other of them seems
i to have continually had an eye upon
; ihe road. They declare that no one
I passed. If their evidence is good, then
1 we are fortunate enough to be able to
pi block the west and also to be able to
I say that the fugitives did not use the
i^l road at all."
Jl "But the bicycle?" I objected.
"Quite so. We will come uO the bi-
I cycle presently. To continue our rea
soning â if these people did not go by
the road they must have traversed the
country to the north of the house or
ie the south of the house. That is cer
tain Let us weigh the one against the
other. On the south of the house is,
as you perceive, a large district of
arable land, out up Into small fields,
I with Btone walls between them. There,
I admit that a bicycle is impossible.
We can dism:Â«is the idea. We turn to
the country on the north. Here there
lies a grove of trees, marked as the
â¢Ragged Shaw.' and on the farther side
stretches a great rolling moor. Lower
(Jill Moor, extending for ten miles and
sloping gradually upward. Here, at
one side of this wilderness Is Holder
r-sse Hall, ten miles by road, but only
?.x a. toss the moor. It is a peculiarly
desolate plain. A few moor farmers
have small holdings, where they rear
sheep and cattle. Except these, the
plover and the curlew are the only in
habitants until you come to the Ches
terfield high road. There is a church
there, a few cottages and an inn. Be
yond that the hills become precipitous.
Surely it is here to the north that our
quest must lie."
"But the bicycle ?" I persisted.
I "Well, well." t said Holmes, impa-
Uently. "A good cyclist does not need
I a high road. The moor is intersected
Hl ' -:ih paths, and the moon at the full.
-* tiulloa! what is this?"
rf There was an agitated knock at the
I !..or and an instant afterward Dr.
Huxtable was in the room. In his
k hand he held a blue cricket cap, with
\ i white chevron on the peak.
"At last we have a. clew!" he cried.
â¢'Thank heaven! at last we are on the
dear boy's track! It is his cap."
i "Where was it found?"
/ "In the van of the gypsies who
camped on '.he moor. They left on
V Tuesday. To-day the police traced
\ them down and examined their cara-
T van. This was found."
1} "How do they account for it?"
/[ â¢"They shuffled and lied â said that
( I they found it on the moor on Tuesday
l\| morning. They know where he is, the
I I hascals! Thank goodness, they are
I ali safe under lock and key.
/[ Either the fear of the law or the
1\ Duke's Durse will certainly get out of
\f\ them all that they know."
J "So far, so good," said Holmes, when
\\ the doctor had at last left the room.
4 "It at least bears out tne tneory that it
Lj is on the side of the Lower Gill Moor
rJ that we must hope for results. The
\% police have really dune nothing locally,
â¢1 save the arrest of these gypsies. Look
here. Watson. There is a watercourse
across the moor. You see it marked
here in the map. In some parts 11
widens into a morass. This is partic
ularly so in the region between Holder
, nesse Hall and the school. It is vain
to look elsewhere for tracks in this dry
weather, but at that point there is cer
!tain!y a chance of some record being
left. I will call you early to-morrow
morning and you and I will try if we
can throw some little light upon the
mystery."
The day Â«v Just breaking when I
woke to find the long, thin form of
Holmes by my bedside. He was fully
dressed and had apparently already
bÂ»en out.
"I have done the lawn and the bicy
cle shed." said he. "I have also had a
ramble through the Ragged Shaw.
Now, Watson, there Is cocoa ready in
the next room. I must beg yon to hur
ry, for we have a great day before us."
His eyes shone and his cheek was
flushed with the exhilaration of the
master workman who sees his work lie
ready before him. A very different
Holmes, this active, alert man, form
the Introspective and pallid dreamer of
Baker street. I felt, as I looked upon
that supple figure, alive with nervous
energy, that it was indeed a strenuous
day that awaited us.
And yet it opened in the blackest dis
appointment. With hlgti hopes, we
struck across the peaty, russÂ«t moor,
Intersected with a thousand sheep
paths, until we came to the broad,
light green belt which marked the mo
rass between us and Holdernesse. Cer
tainly, if the lad had gone homeward,
he must have passed this, and he could
not pass It without leaving his traces.
But no siÂ«m of him or the German
could be seen. With a darkening face
my friend strode along the margin,
eagerly observant of every muddy
stain upon the mossy surface. Sheep
marks there were in profusion, and at
one place, some miles down, cows had
left their tracks. Nothing more.
"Check number one," said Holmes,
looking gloomily over the rolling ex
panse of the moor. "There Is anpther
morass down yonder and a narrow
neck between. Halloa, halloa, halloa!
what have we here?"
We had come on a â¢mail black rib
bon of pathway. In the middle of it,
clearly marked on the sodden soil, was
the track oX a bicycle.
"Hurrah!" I cried. "We have It."
But Holmes was shaking his head
and his face was puzzled and expect
ant rather than joyous.
"A bicycle, certainly, but not the bi
cycle," said he. "I am familiar with
forty-two different impressions left by
tires. This, as you perceive, is a Dun
lop, with a patch upon the outer cover.
Heidegger's tires were Palmer's, leav
ing longitudinal stripes. A' veiling, the
mathematical master, was sure upon
the point. Therefore, it is not Heideg
ger's track."
"The boy's, then?"
"Possibly, if we couW prove a bicycle
to have been in his possession. But
this we have utterly failed to do. This
track, as you perceive, was made by a
rider who was going from the direction
of the school."
"Or toward It?"
"No, ho, my dear Watson. The
more deeply sunk impression is,
of course the hind wheel, up
on which the weight rests.
You perceive several places where it
has passed across and obliterated the
more shallow mark of the front one.
It was undoubtedly heading away from
the school. It may or may not be con
nected with our inquiry.' but we will
follow it backward before we go any
farther."
We did so. and at the end of a few
hundred yards lost the tracks as we
emerged irom the boggy portion of the
mour. Following the path backward
we picked out another spot, where a
spring trickled across it. Here once
again was the mark of the bicycle,
though nearly obliterated by the hoofs
of cows. After that there was no sign,
but the :>ath ran right on into Ragged
Shaw, the \\<jod which backed on to
the school. From this wood the cycle
must ha\ y e <mnerget3. Holmes sat down
on a boulder and rested his chin In his
hands. I had smoked two cigarettes
before he moved.
â¢Well, well," said he at last. "It is,
of course, possible that a cunning man
might change the tire of .his bicycle
in order to leave unfamiliar tracks.
A criminal who was capable of such a
thought is a man. whom I should be
proud to do business with. We will
leave thi6 question undecided and hark
back to our morass again, for we have
left a good deal unexplored."
"We continued our systematic survey
of the edge of the sodden portion of
the moor, and soon our perseverance
was gloriously rewarded. Right across
the lower part of the bog lay a miry
path. Holmes gave a cry of delight as
he approached it. An impression like
a fine bundle of telegraph wires ran
down the center of it. It was the Pal
mer tire. .
"Here is Herr Heidegger sure
enough!" cried Holmes, exultantly.
â My reasoning seems to have been
pretty sound, Watson."
"I congratulate you."
"But we have a long way still to go.
Kindly walk clear of the path. Now
let us follow the trail. I fear that it
will not lead very far."
We found, however, as we advanced,
that this portion of the moor Is inter
sected with soft patches and, though
we frequently lost sight of the track,
we always succeeded in picking it up
once more.
"Do you observe," said Holmes, "that
the rider is now undoubtedly forcing
the pace? There can be no doubt of
it. Look at this impression, where you
get both tires clear. The one is as
deep as the other. That can only mean
that the rider is throwing his weight
on to the handle-bar as a man does
when he is sprinting. By Jove! he has
had a fall."
There was a broad, irregular smudge
covering- some yards of the track. Then
there were a few footmarks and the
lirr reappeared once more.
"A side-slip," I suggested.
Holmes held up a crumpled branch
of flowering gorse. To my horror I
perceived that the yellow blossoms
were ail dabbled with crimson. On
the path, too, and among the heather
were dark stains of clotted blood.
"Bad!" said Holmes. "Bad! Stand
clear, Watson! Not an unnecessary
footstep! What do I read here? He
fell wounded â he stood vp â he re
mounted â he proceeded. But there 13
no other track. CaUle on this side
path. He was surely not gored by a
bull? Impossible! Hut I see no traces
of any one eise. We must push on,
Watson. Surely with stains as well as
the track to guide us he cannot escape
us now."
Our search was not a very long one.
The tracks of the tire T>egan to curve
fantastically upon the wet and shining
path. Suddenly as I looked ahead
the gleam of metal caught my eye
from amid the thick gorse-bushes. Out
of them we dragged a bicycle. Palmer
tired, one pedal bent, and the whole
front of it horribly smeared and slob
bered with blood. On the other side
of the bushes a shoe was projecting.
We ran around, and there lay the un
fortunate rider. He was a tall man,
full-bearded, with spectacles, one glass
of which had been knocked out. The
cause of his death was a frightful blow
upon the head, which had crushed in
part of his skull. That he could have
gone on after receiving such an injury
said much for the vitality and courage
of the man. He wore shoes, but no
socks, and his open coat disclosed a
r.ight-shir> beneath it. It was undoubt
edly the German master.
Holmes turned the body over rever
ently, and examined it with great at
tention. He then sat in deep thought
for a time, and I could see by his ruf
fled brow that this grim discovery had
not, in his opinion, advanced us much
in our inquiry.
"It is a little difficult to know what
to do, Watson," said he, at last. "My
own inclinations are to push this in
quiry on, for we have already lost so
much time that we cannot -afford to
waste another hour. On the other
hand, we axe bound to inform the po
lice of the discovery, and to see that
this poor fellow's body Is looked after."
"I could take a note back."
"But I need your company and as
sistance. Wait a bit! There is a fel
low cutting peat up yonder. Bring him
over here, and he will guide the po
lice."
I brought the peasant across, and
Holmes dispatched the frightened man
with a note to Dr. Huxtable.
"Now, Watson," said he, "we have
picked up two clues this morning. One
is the bicycle with the Palmer tire, and
we see what that has led to. The other
Is the bicycle with the patched Dunlop.
Before we start to investigate that, let
us try to realize what we do know, so
as to make the most of it, and to
separate the essential from the acci
dental."
"First of all, I wish to impress upon
you that the boy certainly left of his
own free-will. He got down from his
window and he went off, either alone
or with someone. That Is sure."
I assented.
"Well, now, let us turn to this un
fortunate German master. The boy
was fully dressed when he fled. There
THE SAN FRANCISCO SUNDAY CALL.
fore, he foresaw what he would do. But
the German went without his socks.
He certainly acted on very Bhort no
tice."
"Undoubtedly."
"Why did he go? Because, from his
bedroom window, he saw the flight of.
the boy: because he wished to overtake "
him and bring him back. He seized his
bicycle, pursued the lad, and in pursu
ing him met his death."
"So it would seem." .
"Now I come to the critical part of
my argument. The natural action of a
man in pursuing a little boy would be
to run after him. He would know that
he could overtake him. But the Ger
man does not do so. He turns to his
bicycle. I am told that he was an ex
cellent cyclist. He would not do this
if he did not see that the boy had some
swift means of escape."
"The other bicycle."
"Let us continue our reconstruction.
He meets his death five miles from the
schoolâ not by a bullet, mark you,
which even a lad might conceivably
discharge, but by a savage blow dealt
by a vigorous arm. The lad, then, had
a companion in his flight. Ami the
flight was a swift one, since it took five
miles before an expert cyclist
could overtake them. Yet we
survey the ground round the
scene of the tragedy. What do
we find? A few cattle tracks, nothing
more. I took a wide sweep round, and
there is no path within fifty yards. An
other cyclist could have had nothing to
do with the actual murder, nor were
there any 'human footmarks."
"Holmes," 1 cried, "this is impossi
ble."
"Admirable:" he said. "A most illu
minating remark. It is impossible as I
state it, .and therefore I must in some
respect have stated it wrong., Yet you
saw for yourself. Can you suggest any
fallacy?"
"He could not have fractured his
skull In a fall?"
"In a morass, Watson?"
"I am at my wits' end."
"Tut, tut, we have solved some worse
problems. At least we have plenty of
material, if we can only use it. Come,
then, and having exhausted the Pal
mer, Jet us see what the"Dunlop with
the patched cover has to offer us."
We picked up the track and followed
It onward for aome distance, but soon
the moor rose into a long, heather
tufted curve and we left the water
course behind us. No further help from
tracks could be hoped for. At the spot
where we saw the last of the Dunlup
tire it might equally have led to Hold
crnesse Hall, the stately towers of
which rose some miles to our left, or to
a low, gray village which lay in front
'of us, and marked the position of the
Chesterfield high road.
As we approached the forbidding and
squalid inn, with the sign of. a game
cock above the door. Holmes gave a
sudden groan and clutched me by the
shoulder to save himself from falling.
He had had one of those violent strainb
of the ankle which leave a man help
less. With difficulty he limped up to
the door, where a squat, dark, elderly
man was smoking a black clay pipe.
"How are you, Mr. Reuben Hayes?"
said Holmes.
"Who are you, and how do you get
my name so pat?" th& countryman an
swered, with a suspicious flash of a
pair of cunning eye*.
"Well, it's printed on the board above
your head. It's easy to see a man who
is master of his own house. I suppose
you haven't such a thing as a carriage
in your stables?"
"No. I have not."
"I can scarcely put my foot to the
ground."
"Don't put It to the ground."
- "But I can't walk."
"Well then, hop."
Mr. Reuben Hayes' manner was far
from gracious, but Holmes took it with
admirable good humor.
"Look here, my man," said he. "This
is really rather an awkward fix for me.
I don't mind how I get on."
"Neither do I," said the morose land
lord.
"The matter is very important. 1
would offer you a sovereign for the use
of a bicycle."
The landlord pricked up his ears.
"Where do you want to go?"
"To Holdernease Hall."
"Pals of the Dook, I suppose?" said
the landlord, surveying our mud
stained garments with ironical eyes.
Holmes laughed good naturedly.
"He'll be glad to see us, anyhow."
"Why?"
"Because we bring him news of his
lost son."
The landlord gave a very visible start.
"What, you're on his track?"
"He has been heard of in Liverpool.
They expect to get him every hour."
Again a swift change passed over
the heavy, unshaven face. His man
ner was suddenly genial.
"I've less reason to wish the Dook
well than most men," said he, "for I
was his head coachman once, and
cruel bad he treated me, it was him
that sacked me without a character
on the word of a lying corn chandler.
But I'm glad to hear that the young
Lord Wfts hear* of In Liverpool and
I'll help you to take the news to the
hall."
"Thank you," said Holmes. "We'll
have some food first. Then you can
bring round the bicycle."
"I haven't got a bicycle."
Holmes held up a sovereign.
"I tell you, man, that I haven't got
one. I'll let you have two horses vi
far as the hall."
"Well, welj," said Holmes, "we'll
talk about it when we've had some
thing to eat."
When we were left alone in the
stone-flagged kitchen it was astonish
ing how rapidly that sprained ankle
recovered. It was nearly nightfall
and we had eaten nothing since early
morning, so that we spent some time
over our meal. Holmes was lost, in
thought and once or twice he walked
over to the window and stared earn
estly out. It opened on to a squalid
courtyard. In the far corner was a
smithy, where a grimy lad was at
work. On the other side were the sta
bles. Holmes had sat down again af
ter one of these excursions, when he
suddenly sprang out of his chair with
a loud exclamation.
"By heaven, Watson. I believe that
I've got It!" he cried. "Yes, yes, it
must be so. Watson, do you remem
ber seeing any cow tracks to-day?"
"Yes, several."
"Where?"
"Well, everywhere. They were ai.
the morass, and again on * the path,
and again near where poor Heideg
ger met his death."
"Exactly. Well, now. Watson, how
many cows did you see on the moor?"
"I don't remember seeing any "
"Strange, Watson, that we should
see tracks all along our line, but never
a cow on the whole moor. Very
strange, Watson, eh?"
"Yes, it is strange."
"Now, Watson, make an effort,
throw your mind back. Can you see
those tracks upon the path?"
"Yes, I can."
"Can you recall that the tracks
I were something like that, Watson"â
he arranged a number of bread
crumbs in this fashion â : : : : :â: â
"and something like this" â : . : . : .
: . â "and occasionally like this" â
.â¢.â¢â¢â¢â¢â¢. "Can you remember
that?"
"No, I cannot."
"But I can. I could swear to it.
However, we will go .back at our
leisure and verify it. What a blind
beetle I have been not to draw my
conclusion!"
"And what is your conclusion?"
"Only that it is a remarkable cow
which walks, canters and gallops. By
George! Watson, It was no brain of a
country publican that thought out
such a blind as that. The coast seems
to be clear, save for that lad in the
smithy: Let us slip out and see what
we can see."
There were two rough-haired,
unkempt horses in the tumble
down stable. Holmes raised the hind
leg of one of them and laughed aloud.
"Old shorfs, but newly shodâ old
shoes, but new nails. This case de
serves to be a classic. Let us go across
to the smithy."
The lad continued his work without
regarding us. I saw Holmes' eye dart
ing to right and left among the litter
of iron and wood which was scattered
about the floor. Suddenly, however,
we heard a step behind us, and there
was the landlord, his heavy eyebrows
drawn down over his savage eyes, his
swarthy features convulsed with pas
sion. He held a short, metal-headed
stick in his hand, and he advanced in
so menacing a fashion that I was right
glad to feel the revolver fa my pocket.
"You infernal spies!" the man cried.
. "What are you drting there?"
"Why, Reuben Hayes," said Holmes
coolly, "one might think that you were
afraid of our finding something out."
The man mastered himself with a
violent effort and his grim mouth
loosened Into a false laugh, whioh was
more menacing than his frown.
"You're welcome to all you can find
in my smithy," said he. "But look
here, mister, I don't care for folk pok
ing about my place without my leave,
so the sooner you pay your score and
get out of this the better I shall be
pleased." '
"All right. Mr. Hayes, no harm
meant, " said Holmes. "We have been
having a look at your horses, but I
think I'll walk after all. T t's not far
I believe."
"Not more than two miiea to the Hall
Kates. That's the road tr the left."
He watched us v.ith sullen eyes until
we had left his promises.
We did not go very far along the
road, for Holmes stopped the instant
that the curve hid us from the land
lord's view.

"We were warm, as the children say,
at that inn," said he. "I seem to grow
colder every step that I take away
from it. No, no, I can't possibly leave
It."
"I am convinced," said I, "that this
Reuben Hayes knows all about It. A
more self-evident villain I never saw."
"Oh! he impressed you in that way,
did he? There are the horses, there is
the smithy. Yes, it is an Interesting
place, this Fighting Cock. I think we
shall have another look at It In an un
obtrusive way."
A long, sloping hillside, dotted with
gray limestpne boulders, atretched be
hind us. We had turned off the road
and were making our way up the hill,
when, looking in the direction of Hold
ernesse Hall, I saw a cyclist coming
swiftly along.
"Get down, Watson!" cried Holmes,
with a heavy hand upon my shoulder.
We had hafd'y sunk from viow when
the man ffcew past us on the road.
Amid a rolling cloud of dust, I caught
a glimpse of a pale, agitated face â
a face with, horror in every lineament,
the mouth open, the eyes staring wild
ly in front. It was like some strrfnge
caricature of the dapper James Wilder
whom we had seen the night before.
"The Duke's secretary!" cried
Holme 3. â¢ < Come, Watson, let us see
-what he does."
We scrambled from rock to rock, un
til in a few moments we had made
our way to a point from which we
could see the front door of the inn.
Wilder 's bicycle was leaning against
the wall beside It. No one was mov
ing ,Ã¼bout the house nor could we
catch a glimpse of any faces at the
windows. Slowly the twilight crept
down as the ev,n sank behind the
high towers of Holdernesse Hall. Then,
fn the gloom, we saw the two side
lamps of a trap light up In the stable
yard of the inn, and shortly afterward
heard the rattle of hoof 9as it wheeled
out into the road and tore off at a fu
rious pace in the direction of Chester
field
"What do you make of that, Wat
son?" Holmes whispered.
"It looks like a flight."
"A single man in a dogcart, so far
as I could see. Well, it certainly was
not Mr. James Wilder, for there he Is
at the door. "
A red square of light had sprung
out of the darkness. In the middle
of it was the black figure of the sec
retary, his head advanced, peering
out into the night. It was evident
that he was expecting 3ome one. Then
at last there were steps in the road,
r second figure Was visible for an in
fetr.nt against the light, the door shut
und all was black once more. Five
tninutes later a lamp was lit in a
room UDOii the first floor.
"It spems to be a curious class of
custom that is done by the Fighting
Cock," said Holme?.
"The bar is on the other side."
'Quite so. These are what one may
call private guests. Now, what in the
world is Mr. James Wilder doing in
that den at this hour of night, and
â¢who is the companion who comes to
meet him there? Come, "Watson, we
must really take a risk, and try to in
vestigate this a little more closely."
Together we stole down to the road
and crept across to the door of the inn.
The bicycle still leaned against the
wall. Holmes struck a match and held
it to the back wheel, and I heard him
chuckle as the light fell upon a patched
Dunlop tire. Up above us was the
lighted window.
â I must have a peep through that.
Watson. If you bend your back and
support yourself upon the wall, I think
that I can manage."
An instant later, his feet were on my
shoulders, but he was hardly up be
fore he was down again.
"Come, my friend." said he, "our
day's work has Deen quite long enough.
I think that we have gathered all that
we can. It's a long walk to the school,
and the sooner we get started the bet
ter. "
He hardly opened his lips during that
weary trudge across the moor, nor
would he enter the school when he
reached it, but went on to Mackleton
Station, whence he could send some
telegrams. Late at night I heard him
consoling Dr. Huxtable. prostrated by
the tragedy of his master's death, and
later still he entered my room as alert
and vigorous as he had been when he
started In the morning. "All goes well,
my friend," said he. "I promise that
before to-morrow evening we shall
have reached the solution of the mys
tery."
At II o'clock next morning my friend
and I were walking up the famous yew
avenue of Holdernesse Hall. "We were
ushered through the magnificent Eliza
bethan doorway and into his Grace's
study. TherÂ« we found Mr. James
Wilder, demure and- courtly, but with
some trace of that wild terror of the
night before still lurking in his fur
tive eyes and In his twitching features.
"You have come to see his Grace?
I am sorry, but the fact ia that the
Dyke is far from well. He has been
very much upset by the tragic news.
We received a telegram from Dr. Hpx
table yesterday afternoon, which told
us of v6ur discovery."
"I must see the Duke. Mr. Wilder."
"But he is in his room."
"Then I must go to his room."
"I believe he Is in his bed."
"I will see him there."
Holmes' cold and inexorable manner
showed the secretary that it was use
less to argue with him.
"Very good. Mr. Holmes, I will tell
him that you are here."
After an hour's delay, the great no
bleman appeared. His face was more
cadaverous than ever, his shoulders
had rounded, and he seemed to me to
be an altogether older man than he
had been the morning before. He
greeted us with a stately courtesy and
seated himself at his desk, his red
P streaming down on the table.

"X T OW as he stood in his room in
/\j the gray light of the early
I \l morning a feeling of distaste
V V came over him. Why had he
spoken? Had it been from any
sympathy for the cause he cham
pioned? Wa^ it not rather in a mere
spirit of hurt pride and resentment â
the same resentment that had made
him refuse to eliminate the bitter stan
zas from his book? A flush rose to
bis brow. How unworthy had been his
njctive beside that of .the stripling who
had written against that same bill:
A sense of shame rushed through
him. In the late weeks at Newstead
he had felt how small were such im
pulses. He had told himself that he
"would sing for his song's own sake and
keep it free from the petty and the re
taliative; that he would live in the "
azure his own mind created and let the
â world's praise and abuse alike go by.
' Had he kept this determination?
He poured out a second tumbler of
the licuor and drank it.
Neither claret nor champagne ever
affected him, but the double draft of
brandy brought an immediate intoxi
cation that grew almost instantly to a
gray giddiness. He pushed a couch to
the wall, shoved a screen between it
and the dawn-lit windows, threw him
self down without undressing and fell
into a moveless sleep that lasted many
tours. The reaction, his physical
weariness and both topped by the
cograc, made his slumber log-like, a
dull, dead blank of nothingness, un
broken by any sound.
Fletcher came in yawning, looked
Into his master's sleeping room and
wen: out shaking his head. Later he
"brought c Dile of letters, and relaid
the fire. Xoon came â one, two o'clock
'â â ard meanwhile there were many
knocks upon tne door, from each of
â¢which the valet returned with larger
eyes to add another personal card or
note to the increasing pile on the
table.
As the clock struck three, he opened
the door u:on two of the best-liked
of his master's old-time town associ
ates. Ther were Tom Moore, with a
young ruddr face of Irish humor, and
Sheridan, clad to sprucery as if Apol
lo had sent him a birthday suit, an-.I
Â«inil>ng like * rakLsh gray-haired
cherub.
"Fletcher, where**! your master?'
"His lordship fs out. Mr. Sheridan."
â¢;The devil he is! Hang it. we'll
â¢wr.it then. Tom. Go and look for him,
Fletcher."
"I shouldn't know where to look.
sir. My lord didn't come in at all last
night." â 
Sheridan whistled. "That's queer.
WelL we'll wait a while" â and they
entered. As he saw the pile of newly
arrived stationery, the older man
threw his stick into the corner and

"Maka-your toilet, my boy," he told
him good-naturedly. "We will wait"
â and Gordon resigned himself to the
ministrations of Fletcher and the com
fort of hot water and fine linen.
When he came back to find his visit
ore smoking, he had thrust all outward
agitation under the surface. He was
dressed in elegance, and a carnation
was in the buttonhole of his white
great-coat. There was less of melan

more of slumbrous fire in the gray

The Price of the Bauble.

"what a coat! It becomes him as if
he'd been hatred in it."
Lord Peterf^hn at his elbow gazed
with seconding approval. The somber
elegance of the black velvet dress coat,
which Gordon wore close-buttoned, and
the white rolling collar left open so- as
to expose the throat, served to heighten
the pallor of his skin and set in high
relief the handsome, patrician face
above it.
' Still on his pedestal." observed Pe
tersham. "Before long, his vertex sub
limls will displace enough stars to
orertkrow the Newtonian system! I
hear Caro Lamb is not tired doing
humage. His affair with Lady Oxford
seems to be tapering."

"He's a martyr to them. Stap my vi
tals, the beauties run after him because
he won't make up to item. Treat wo
men like fools, and they'll all worship
you! 1 '
To the pinnacle this implied. Gordon
had risen at a leap. He was the idol of
fashionable London, the cnief topic of
frivolous boudoir gossip and intellec
tual tabie talk. His person, his travels
spangied with romantic tales, his
gloom, his pride, his beauty, and the
dazzle of his prodigious success, com
bined to bring him an unheard-of hom
age. His newest book was on every
drawing-room table in the kingdom.
He was made much of by Lady Jersey.
Hostesses quarreled over entertaining
him. and ladies of every title below the
blood royal asked Vj be placed next him
at dinner. The Regent himself had
asked him to Cariton House.
Each of bis publications 6ince that
February day when he woke to fame
and hen the chariot of the incompar
able Captain Brummell had set him
down at Melbourne House, had had a
like history. Each had won the same
rapt praise, the same wondering hom
age to talent. If they missed the burn
ing fervor of those earlier impassioned
lines on Grecian liberty, if they held,
each more clearly, an under-note of ag
nosticism, it was overlooked in delight
at their freedom, their metrical sweep
and seethe of feeling, the melancholy
sea-surge and fret of their moods. His
ancient detractors, whom his success
had left breathless, constrained to in
nuendo, had added to hia personality
the tang of the audacious, of bizarre
license, of fantastic eccentricity, that
beckoned even while it repelled.
One would have tLought Gordon him

him in the night hours in his
tumbled study, when he remem

knew. The convention that had carped
at him before his fame he trod under
foot. He frequented Manton's shoot-
Ing gallery, practiced the broadsword
at Angelas, sparred with "Gentleman
Jackson," the champion pugilist, in his
rooms in Bond street, and clareted and
champagned at the Cocoa Tree with
Sheridan and Moore till five in the
matin. Other men might conceal their
harshest peccadilloes; Gordon con
cealed nothing. What he did he did
frankly, with disdain for appearances.
Hypocrisy was to him the soul's gan
grene. He preferred to have the world
think htm worse than to think him
better than he was.
His enemies in time had plucked up
courage, revamped old stories and In
' THE' SAX. FRANCISCO SUNDAY CALL.
vented new: tnese scenTed to give him
little concern. He not only kept silence
but declined to allow his friends, such
as Sheridan and Hobhouse, to cham
pion him. When the Chronicle barbed
a sting with a reference to the enor
mous sums he was pocketing from his
copyholds, he shrugged his shoulders.
John Murray, his publisher, knew that
the earning of "The Giaour" had beea
given to a needy author; that "Zu
leika" had relieved a family from the
slavery of debt and sent them, hopeful
colonists, to Australia.
Gordon passed into the clnb. bowing
to the group in the bow-window with
conventional courtesy, and entered the
reading-room. It was September, but
the night had turned cool, and he
dropped mo a chair before the hearth.
"Why does Lady Holland always
have that damned screen between the
whole room and the fire?" he grum
bled half-humorously. "I who bear
cold no better than an antelope, aria
never yet found a sun quite done to
my taste, was absolutely petrified, and
couldn't even shiver. All the rest, too,
looked as If they were just unpacked,
like salmon from an ice basket."
A lackey in the club's regalia brought
a tray of letters and set it beside him.
Gordon lit a cigar before he examined
them. They were the usual collection:
a sprinkling of effusions from romantic
incognitas; a graver tribute from Wal
ter Scott: a pressing request for that
evening from Lady Jersey.
'To meet Madame de StacK" he
mused. "I once traveled three thou
sand miles to get among silent people;
and this lady writes octavos and talks
folios. I have read her essay against
suicide; if I heard her recite it, I
might swallow poison."
The final note he lifted was written
on blue-bordered paper, its corners em
bossed with tiny cockle-shells, and he
opened it with a nettled frown.
"Poor Caro!" he muttered. "Why
will you persist in imprudent things?
Some day your epistle will fall Into the
lion's jaws, and then I must hold out
my iron. I am out of practice, but I
won't go to Manton's now. Besides," he
added with a shrug, "1 wouldn't return
his shot. I usÂ»d to be a famous wafer
splitter, but since I began to feel I had
a bad cause to support, I have left off
the exercise."
HSs face took on a deeper perplexity
as he read the eccentric, curling hand:
**. . . Gordon, do yon remember
that first dinner at Melbourne House â
the day after your speech in the
Lords? You gave me a carnation
from your buttonhole. You said.
'I am told your ladyship likes
all that is new and rareâ for the mo
ment:* Ah. that meeting was not only
for the moment with me. you know
that: It has lasted ever since. I have
never heard your name announced that
it did not thrill every pulse of my
body. I have nevev heard a venomous
word against you that did not sting
me, too."
Gordon held the letter in a candle
flame, and dropped it on the solver. As
it crackled to a mass of glowing tinder,
a step fell behind him. He looked up to
see Moore.
"Tom," he said, his brow clearing, "I
am In one of my most vaporish mo
ments. '
Moore seated himself on a chair
arm and poked the blackening twist of
paper with his walking-stick. He
smiled an indulgent smile of prime
and experience.
"From which I conclude â " he an
swered sagely, "that you are bound to
Drury Lane greenroom instead of to
Lady Jerseys this evening."
Gordon's lips caught the edge of the
other's smile.
"You are right. I'm going to let Jane

stage than on. They are only hothouse

The gaze of the man beside herâde

a thought of her.

ing Gordon long ago had had engraved
the stanzas he had written on the night
his mother lay dead. The grotesqu*rie
had been hailed with enthusiasm and
the company had sat that evening
puwned and girdled about the dinner
table, where Sheridan's gray poll had
given him the seat of honor as abbot.
Gordon wore one of the black gabard
ines, as he lit the candle in the utterly
confused library. It was a sullen, mag
nificent chamber. The oak wainscoting
was black with age. Tapestries and
book shelves covered one side, and floor
and tables were littered with reviews
and books, carelessly flung from their
; place.
A shout, mingled with the prolonged
howls of a wolf and the angered
"â¢woof" of a bear sounded from the
driveway â the guests were amusing
.' themselves with the beasts chained on
cither side of the entrance. These were
â¢ â¢ relics of that old, resentful season when
Gordon had hermited himself there to

' Why not the first?" the other pur
sued. "I tried it younger than you."
The speaker sighed presently, and
locking his hands behind his head
leaned back against the cushions, his
fine, rugged face under its shock of
rough gray hair turned tender. "My

,t on the terrace a white image standing
.out In relief from the swathing dark

ihat teased and worried him, would it

A sudden recollection came to him,
f the dust of a past yearâ a recol
iection of a youth with bright eyes
find tangled hair, in the Fleet Prison.
There had been an hour, before suc
had bitten him, when he had
promised himself that fame's fox-nre
should not lure him, that he would
cherish his Bong and rid his soul of
ihf petty things that dragged It down.
v had that promise been fulfilled?
â¢ poor adventure, and empty in
trigue and flickering rushlight amours
to which that restless something in
him had driven him on, an anchorless
craft in the cross-tides of passion!
"Home!" he mused. "To pursue no
wtll-o'-the-wlep of fancy! To shut out
all vagrant winds and prolong that
epark of celestial fire!"
He drew a quick sibilant breath, sat
dcwn at the writing-table and wrote
hastily but unerringly, a letter, clean
etched and unembellished, a simple
statement and a question. '
He signed it, laughing aloud as a
sense of wild incongruity gushed over
him. Through the heavy oaken doors
he could hear mingled laughter and
uproar. A stentorian bass was rum
bling a drinking-song.
What a challenging antithesis! Lava
and snow â erratic comet and chaste
moon â Jungle passions and the cahn
of a Northern landscape! A proposal
of marriage written at such a time
and place, with a drlnklng-stave shout
ed in the next room! And what would
be her answer?
The daring grew brighter In his eye.
He sealed the letter with a coin from
his waistcoat Docket, sprang up and
Jerked the bellrope. The footman en
tered.
'â¢Rushton, have Selim saddled at
once and take this note to Mansfield.
Ride like the devil. Do you hear?"
"Yes. m y lord." The boy looked at
the superscription, put the note in his
pocket and was gone.
i Jfirdon laughed again â a burst of
gusty excitement â and seized the full
inkwell Into which he had dipped his
pen. "it snail serve no lesser ., pur
pose," he exclaimed, Â and hurled it
straight through the open window.
Then he threw open the door and
walked hastily toward the hilarity of
the great dining-room.
. CHAPTER XII.
"Man's Love Is of Man's Life a Thing
Apart/: ; <
What he saw as he emerged from the
hall was Saturnalia indeed.
Sheridan, his robe thrown : open from
his capacious frame, sat with knees
wide apart, his chair tilted back, his
face crumpling with amusement. Hob
house sat v cross-legged on the stone
coffin. Others, - robed and tonsured,
were grouped about the board, and on
it was perched a stooped and ungainly
figure in a somber dress of semi-clerical
severity. ' :3tiÃ&m&Sstim-
"Sunburn me. It's Dr. Cassidy," mut
tered Gordon, with a grim smile. "And
without his tracts! What's he doing
at Newstead? The rascals â they've got
him fuddled!"
The hospitality offered in the host's
absence had in truth proved too much
for the doctor. Now as he balanced
on his gaitered feet among the over
turned winebottles he looked a very
unclerical figure indeed. His neckcloth
was awry and his flattish eyes had a
look of comical earnestness and unac
customed good-fellowship. He held a
â wine glass and waved it in uncertain
gestures, his discourse punctured by
frequent and unstinted applause:
â¢'What was the Tree of Knowledge
doing in the garden, you ask. Why not
planted on the other side of the wall?
Human reason, enlightened by inspira
tion, finds no answer in the divine
word. Theology is our' only refuge.
Adam was predestined to Bin. All
created things are contingent on om
nipotent volition. Sin being predes
tined, the process leading to that sin
must be predestined, too. See? Sin-
Adam. Gardenâ snake. The law of the
divine will accomplished."
Hobhouse wiped his eyes with his
handkerchief. "Who could contem
plate the picture," he groaned, "with
out tears? Poor fallen man! I weep
for him."
The remark struck the lecturer with
pathos. The look of stern satisfaction
with which he had so eloquently Jus
tified the eternal tragedy melted into
a compassionate expression which had
a soft tinge of the romantic. He smiled
âa smile of mingled burgundy and be
nevolence.
"Herein, gentlemen, appears our les
son of infinite pity. Man expelled from
Eden, but still possessing sCve. Justice
tempered with mercy. Love of woman
compensating: for the loss of earthly
Paradise."
â¢'True, true," murmured Hobhouse.
' 'There's heaven on earth in woman's
love,' as Mr. Moore, here, sings. A
prime subject for another toast, doctor.
We've drunk to the navy and to- the
ology; now for a glass to her eternal
ladyship :-?-Egad! Here's Gordon!"
The final word brought a shout, and
the glasses were refilled. "Gordon's
toast!" they insisted as they opened
ranks. "A toast or a new poem!"
Some disturbance out of doors had
roused the animals kenneled at the hall
entrance and a battery of growls min
gled with the importunities.
Sheridan pounded with his great fist
on the jingling board till the uproar
Btilled. "The lord of the manor speaks!' 1
he proclaimed.
Gordon approached the table and
picked up the skull-cup. In the blaze
of candlelight his face showed marked
ly its singular and magnetic beauty.
He glanced about him an Instant â at
Sheridan's waggish, rough-hewn coun
tenance, at the circle of younger
flushed and uproarious ones, and at
the labored solemnity and surprise of
the central figure on the table. The
doctor's answering stare waa full of a
fresh bewilderment; he was struggling
to recall a message he had brought to
some oneâ he had forgotten to whomâ
which in the last half-hour had slipped
like oil from his mind.
In Gordon's brain verses yet unwrit

blue eyes darkened to violet.

Sheridan saw Gordon set down the
skull-cup as the spot of color faded
from his cheek. He turned to the en
trance.
"Curse catch me!" gasped the wit,
springing, to his feet. "Lady Mel
bourne and Miss Milbanke!"
CHAPTER XIII.
The Smirched Image.
All turned astonished faces. Just
inside the oaken door, swung wide
open to the night, stood her ladyship,
her features expressing a sense of hu
mor struggling with dignity, and just
behind her, with a look of blent puz
zle and surprise, her stately niece,
Annabel Milbanke. Mrs.. Muhl, Gor
don's withered fire-lighter, was hov
ering in the rear.
It was a tense moment. Gordon's
glance swept Annabel's face â distin
guished a letter still unopened in her
hand â as he came forward to greet
them. A dull red was climbinsr over
Cassidy's sobered face, and with
something between a gulp and a groan
he got down heavily from his com
manding position.
It was Lady Melbourne who broke
the pause:
"I fear we intrude. We were driv
ing across to Annesley, where there is
a ball to-night, and felt tempted to
take your Lordship with us. We had
not known of your guests. Dr. Cas
sidy rode ahead to apprise you of our
call."
The doctor was mopping 1 his mot
tled brow. He was far too miserable
to renly.
"I fear our hospitality outran our
discretion," ventured Gordon. "The
doctor perhaps forgot to mention It."
Lady Melbourne's quick gaze over
ran the scene and lingered on the
crosses and the monkish robes with a
slow dawning smile.
Sheridan made a dramatic gesture.
"Lo, the first poet of his age in the
depths of one of his abandoned de
bauches!" He pointed to Mrs. Muhl,
who stood in the background, her
wrinkled countenance as brown as a
dry toast â "Behold the troop of Pa
phlan damsels, as pictured In the
Morning Post! Evasion is no longer
possible."
"I see. And you, doctor?"
"The doctor," said Moore, maintain
ing his gravity, "had just read us his
latest tract"
"I regret we missed it." She turned
to Gordon. "We will not linger. Good
nJght, gentlemen. No " as Gor
don protested â "our carriage and
escort are waiting."
"My dear Lady Melbourne," inter
posed Sheridan, "the entire chapter
shall escort you. As abbott I claim
my right" â and he offered her his
arm. Gordon followed with her niece.
Annabel's band fluttered on his
s'eeve. "We heara your toast," she
Said. "I did not dream it of you."
On the threshold a tide of rich light
met them. The moon had risen and
vwis lifting above the moor beyond a
belt of distant beech wood, bathing the
gclden flanks of the hills, flooding the
lt.ug lake with soft yellow luster and
turning: the gray ruins of the priory to
dull silver. Lady Melbourne led the
way out t<Â» the mole of the drained
moat with a cry of delight: "What a
perfect lilac- night! It is like Venice.
All it larks is a gondola and music."
Cordon and Annabel had lingered at
Ihe turn of the parapet. He put out
his hand and louched the letter she
held with his forefinger. "You have
nut opened it."
"No. Your footman met us coming
in the lodge gate."
"Read.it."
She looked at him a moment hesitat
ingly. Fur a long time she had not
been ignorant of her interest in George
Gordon. She admired him also, as
evf-ry woman admires talent and
achievement, and the excess of wor
ship which the world gave him fed her
pride in the special measure of his re
gard. She saw something new in his
look to-night â something more genuine,
yet illusive.
"Read it," he repeated.
She broke the seal and held the writ
ten page to the moonlight. As she read
a soft mellow note arose. It was Hob
house's violoncello, playing an aria of
Rossini's â a haunting melody that
matched the night. The notes were
still throbbing when her eyes lifted.
Gordon had taken a golden guinea
from his pocket; he, leaned forward and
laid it on the letter's waxen Beal. It
fitted the impression.
"It was a gift," he said. "It is the
one you gave me that day at the book
shop."
She felt a sudden tremor of heartâ
or of nerves.
"Oh," she exclaimed, thrilled for a
brief moment: "and you kept it?"
At that instant a figure approached
them across the terrace, doffing his
cap awkwardly. It was the under
gardener, bringing- a trinket he had
found that afternoon among the lily
bulbs.
Gordon looked at the plain gold cir
clet he handed him. He turned to An
nabel with a strange expression as the
man disappeared.
"It is my mother** wedding ring." he
said in a low voice. "It was lost when
I was a child."
"How very odd," she commented, to
find itâ to-day!"
The music had ceased, and Lady Mel
bourne and her tonsured attendants
were coming toward them.
Annabel's hand rested on the stone
railing and Gordon took it, looking full
into her eves.
"Shall I put It on?" he asked
She looked from the ring to his face
her cool fingers trembling in â¢ 3
"Yes," she answered, and he slipped
It on her finger.
The noise of the departing carnage
wheels had scarce died away when
Sheridan entered the library, thither
Gordon had preceded him. He was
tittering inordinately. Â.Â«,â¢
"I've been trying to find Cassidy he
said, "but he's gone. Went and got his
horse while Hobhouse was fiddling.
Poor doctor! If he'd only been a par
"Look, look!" cried Gordon. He was
pointing to the window.
Sheridan stared. The unwavering
moonlight fell on the Image of Vesta
no longer marble-white. The Inkwell
Gordon had hurled through the window
had struck full on its brows, and the
clear features and raiment were biacK
ened and befouled with a sinister stain!
CHAPTER XIV.
What Game of the Treacle-Moon.
"The trtaole-moon is ovtr. I am
awake and find myself married."
Gordon read the lines in the diary
he held, by the fading daylight. He
sat in the primrose garden of his town
house on Piccadilly Terrace, beside a
wicker teatable. The day was at its
amber hour. The curtain* of the open
windows behind him waved lazily in
the breeae and the fragrance of haw
thorn clung like a caress across the
twilight. What he read had been the
last entry in the book.
He smiled grimly, remembering the
night he had written it It was at Sea
ham, the home of his wife's girlhood,
the final day of their stayâ the end of
that savorless month of oameness and
stagnation, of eating frtiit and saun
tering, playing dull games at cards,
yawning, reading old Annual Registers
and daily papers, listening to the
monologue that his elderly father-in
law called conversation, and watching
the growth of stunted gooseberry bushes
âthe month in which he had eaten
of the bitter fruit of the Tree of Knowl
edge. To-day he recalled the trenchant
features of that visit distinctly; the
prim, austere figure of Lady Noel, his
wife's mother, presiding at the table;
Sir Ralph opposite, mumbling for the
third time, over a little huddle of de
canters which could neither Interrupt
nor fall asleep, the speech he had made
at a recent taxmeeting; his own wife
with eyes that so seldom warmed to
his, but grew keener each day to
glance cold disapproval; and Mrs.
Clermont, Lady Noel's companion and
confidante, blackgowned. bloodless,
with noiseless gliding step and observ
ant gazeâ Jane Clermont's aunt, as he
had incidentally learned.
"The treacle-moon is over!" And
that satiric comment had been penned
almost a year ago!
Gordon moved his shoulders with a
quick gesture, as though dismissing an
unpleasant reflection, and took from
his pocket a little black phial. He
measured out a minute quantity of the
dark liquid into a glass and poured it
full of water. He drank the dull,
cloudy mixture at a- draft.
"How strange that mind should need
this!** he said to himself. "My brain is
full of images â rare, beautiful, dream
like â but they are meaningless, inco
herent, unattached. A few drops of
this elixir and they coalesce, crystal
lize, transform themselves â and I have
a poem. I have only to write it down.
I wrote 'Lara' in three evenings while
I was undressing' from the opera. It
shan't master me as it has De Quincey
either. Why, all my life I have de
nied myself even meat. My soul shall
not be the slave of any appetite!"
He smiled whimsically as he set
down the glass: "What nonsense it is
to talk of soul," he muttered, "when a
cloud makes it melancholy and wine
makes it mad!"
He paused, listening Intently. A low
sound, an infant's cry, had caught his
ear. His eyes grew darker violet. His
look changed.
"Ada! Ada!" he said in a whisper.
In his voice was a singular vibrant
accentâ intense, eager, yet the words
had the quality of a sacrament and a
â¢consecration.
He rose, thrust the diary into his
pocket and went into the house, ascend
ing the stair to a small room at the end
of the hall. The door was ajar and a
dim light showed within. He listened,
then pushed the door wider and enter
ed. A white nursery bed stood in one
corner, and Gordon noiselessly placed
a chair beside it and sat down, his el
bow on his knee and hlsÂ» chin in hi 3
hand, looking at the little face against
the pillow, the tiny fist lying on the
coverlid.
Gazing, his deeply carved lips molded
6oftly, a sense of the overwhelming
miracle of life possessed him. This
small fabric was woven of his own
flesh. He caw his own curving mouth,
his full chin, his brow. Some day those
hands would cling to his, those lips
would frame the word "father." What
of life's pitfalls, of Its tragedies, await
ed this now being he had brought into
the world?
He sighed, and as if in answer, the
baby sighed, too. The sound smote
him strangely. Was there some occult
sympathy between them? Her birth
right was not only of flesh, but of
spirit. Had she also share in his Iso
lated heart, his wayward impulses, his
passionate pride?
At length he took out the diary and
opening it on his knee, began to write
â lines whose feeling swelled from some
great wave of tenderness:
Ada! my one sweÂ«t daughter! if a name
Dearer and purer were, it uhould .be thins.
Whate'er of earth divide ua I shall claim
Not tears, but tenderness to answer mlnÂ»:
Go where I will, to me thou art the sameâ
A loved regret which I would not resign.
There arÂ« but two things in my destiny â
A world to roam through, and a home with
thee.
I
I can reduce- ail feelings but this one:
And that I would not â for at length I sm
Such soen.es as those wheroin my life begun.
The earliest â even the only paths for me â
Had I but sooner learned the crown to shun,
I had been better than I now can be;
The passions which have torn me would have
died;
I had not suffered, and thou hadst not sighed.
I feel almost at times as I bar* felt
In happy childhood; trees, and flower* and
brooks
Which do remember me of where- I dwelt
Ere roy young mmd was sacrificed to book*.
Come aa of yore upon me. and can melt
My heart with recognition of their looltÂ»;
Till even at moments I have thought to see-
Some living thing to loveâ but none like the*.
With false ambition what had I to do?
Little with love, and least of all with fans*.
And yet they came unsought, and with ma
grew.
And mad* me all which th<*y can make â a.
name.
Yet this was not the end I did pursue;
Surely I once beheld a nobler aim.
Tet if thou help me find itâ even so
Shall I be glad that I have purchased woe!
The door of the room adjoining
opened and a figure dressed in white
appeared. He rose and passed
through.
"You wished me, Annabel?"
"1 do not wish Ada disturbed. *As
you know, I am starting with her to
Seaham to-morrow, and she needs the
rest."
"I was very quiet," he said, almost
apologetically, and a little wearily.
Her critical eye had wandered to
the book and pencil in his hand. ThÂ©
look was cold â glacially so â and dis
approving, as she asked with quiet
point:
"My lord, when do you intend to
give up your tlresoxn* habit of versU
fying?"
He stared at her. In all her lack
of understanding, she had at least
spared him this. Tet this was really
what she thought! At heart she de
spised him for the only thing that to
him made life endurable. She took
no pride In his poetry, wished him a
man like others of her circle â a dull,
church-going, speech-reading, tea
drinking, partridge-hunting clod: a
flush blurred his vision.
"Surely," a thin edge of contempt
cutting in her words, "you do not in
tend always to do only this? You
are a peer, you have a seat in th*Â»
Lords. You might be anything you
choose."
"But If I am â what I choose?" hÂ«
said difficultly.
A chill anger lay behind her con
strained manner. Her lips were
pressed tight together. During the
whole time of their marriage he had
never seen her display more feeling
than in that brief moment on tnt?
terrace at Newstead when he had put
his mother's ring upon her finger.
For a long time he had watched for
some signâ each day feeling his heart,
too savage of vitality, contract and
harden under that colorless restraint
till he had come to realize that the
untroubled gentleness was only passiv
ity, the calm strength but complacency
as cold as the golden guinea he had
treasured, that the flower he had chos
en for Its white fragrance was a sculp
tured altar-lily. Now her mind seemed
Jolted from its conventional groove.
The fact was that the constant flings
of his enemies, which he noted with
sovereign contempt, had pierced her
deeply, wounding that lovÂ« of thÂ«
world's opinion so big in her. And a
venomous review which her mother
had brought her that day had mingled
Its abuse with a strain of pity for her.
and pity she could not bear.
"Why do you not choose to live Ilka
other men?" she broke out. "There is
something so selfish, so unnatural in
your engrossed silences, your change
able moods, your disregard of ordinary
customs. You believe nothing that
other men believe."
His face had grown weirdly white.
The sudden outburst nad startled him.
He was struggling with resentment.
"Cassldy's doctrinal tracts, for in
stance?" The query had a tinge of
sarcasm.
She bit her lips. "You have no idea
of reverence for anything. I might
have guessed it that nighi at Newstead
and how you treated him! You speak
your views on religion â views that I
hate â openly, anywhere. You write and
write and print them, too. In verse l"
"You are frank," he said; "let mÂ«
be the same. What my brain conceive*
my hand shall write. If I valued fame.
I should flatter received opinions. That
I have never done! I cannot and will
not give the lie to my doubts, come
what may."
"What right have you to have thosÂ»
doubts?" Her anger was rising full
fledged, and bitter-winged with malice.
'â¢Why do you set yourself agairst all
that is best? What do you believe in
that is good. I should like to know?"
"I abhor books of religion." he re
sponded steadily, "and the blasphe
mous notions of sectaries. I have no
belief in their absurd heresies and
Thirty- nine Articles. I feel Joy in all
beautiful and sublime things. But I
hate convention and cant and lay
figure virtue, and shall go on hating
them to the end of the chapter."
"To the end of the chapter!" she
echoed. "You mean to do nothing
mureâto think of nothing but scrib
bling pretty lines on paper and making
a mystery of, yourself! What is our
life together? What did you marry ma
for?"
"Bella!" The word was almost a cry.
"I married you for faith, not for creeds!
I am as I have always been â I hava
concealed nothing. I married you for
sympathy and understanding! I know
I am not like other men â but I tried
to make you love and understand meâ
I tried! Why did you marry me?"
For an instant the real pain in thÂ«
appeal seemed to cleave through ker
icy demeanor and she made an involun
tary movement. But as she hesitated,
Fletcher knocked at the door:
"Mr. Sheridan, my lord, come to take
you to Drury Lane."
The words congealed the softer feel
ing. As the valtt withdrew, she turned
upon her husband.
"Sheridan! and Drury Lane! That is
the kind of company you prefer to
keep! A doddering old man who fails
asleep over his negus in White's bow
window, coming and going here at all
hours, and littering the library with hia
palsied snuff-taking."
A doddering old man! It was truÂ».
The soul of White's and Brookes'. thÂ«

tronage. Gordon had more than one*
of late come between him and a low
sponging-house or the debtors' prison.
Yet at his wife's tone, a gleam of
anger shot Into his eyes â anger that
made them steely-blue as sword blades.
"Sheridan was my friend." he said.
"My friend from the first, when others
snarled. He is old now â old and failing
â but he is still my friend. Is a man
to pay no regard to loyalty or friend
ship?"
"He should have regard first to his
own reputation. Do you? Even Brum
mell and Petersham and your cholc*
fops of the Cocoa-Tree tavern and
Drury Lane committee have soma
thought for the world's opinion. But
you have none. You care nothing for
what it thinks of you or of your mor
ality."
"Morality!" he repeated slowly. "I
never heard the word before from any
body who was not a rascal that used i:
for a purpose!"
"Why will you sit silent," she con
tinued, "and hear yourself defamed
everywhere without a word? Why wIH
you not defend yourself?"
He shrugged his shoulders, the flash
of indignation past. She had touched
the point of least response. The shrug
angered her even more than his satirio
reply :
"What man can bear refutation?"
"You seem to think it beneath your
dignity to dany slander." she went on.
"You always did. I thought It would
be different after we were married. But
it has grown worse. The papers print
more and more horrible things of you,
and you do not care â either for yourself
or for me!"
He gazed at her with a curious in
tentness.
"Surely you pay no heed to such Ir
responsible tales?"
"If they were all! Do you suppose I
do not hear what people say besides?
They do not spare my ears! Do you
think I do not know the stories â what
they used to say of your bachelor af
fairsâwith Lady Oxford, and Lady
Frances Wedderburn Websterâ and
Caro Lamb"'
"Is there none more recent?" A bit
ter smile had appeared, called by the
veiled Insinuation in her tone.
Another name flew to her tongue, for
malicious rumor had credited him with
a footllght amour. "Yes â Jane Cler
mont!"
A frown of incredulity and annoy
hung bUekly on his brow an instant.
Had this baaekss gratuitous fling gone
beyond the circle of Drury Lane go
sipers? Had it even reached his wife's
ears? Aloud he said:
"Really, I can scarcely hold myself
responsible for silly chatterers vho are
determined to Rochefoucauld my mo
tives. I seem to be fast becoming the
moral Aesop of the community. 1 am
judged by what I presume Dr. Cassidywould call a dramatic Calvinismâpre
destined damnation without a sinner's
f.vn fault."
Her control was gone. She could not
trust herself to speak further and turn
ed away. He waited a moment in the
doorway, but she did not move, and
with an even -night" he left her.
At the foot of the stair, during Gor
don's painful interview, a black-gowned
"woman had noiselessly bent over the
hall table. A letter, arrived by the
post, had been laid there by Fletcher
for his master. She lifted it and ex
amined it closely. The address was
written in a peculiar, twirly handwrit
ing, on blue-tinted paper that bore in
each corner the device of a cockle
shelL She listened, then passed with it
into the library. .;.; ; *.
The room was unliehted, but a spring
fire flickertd on the hearth. She caught
up a paper-knife and crouching on the
hearth held its thin blade in the flame.
When the metal was warmed, she soft
ened the edges of the seal and with
deftness that betrayed long practice
split it off without its breaking, opened
the note and read it. Her basilisk eyes
lighted with satisfactionâ the triumph
of a long quest rewarded. Then she
warmed the wax again, replaced it, and
as it hardened, broke it across as if the
letter had been opened in the ordinary
manner. /
As Mrs. Clermont rose to her feet, a
thin, severe figure stood on the thres
hold. She caw with relief that it was
Lady Noel, and handed her the letter
wan a feline smile.
"Perhaps your ladyship will know if
this should be preserved." she said. "I
found it just now on the floor."
Lady Noel's eyes glittered at sight of
the cockle-shells. She read it hastily
by the firelight. Her look was coldly
,yet triumphantly malignant as she
leaned forward.
"Put an outer wrapper on this," she
ordered in an undertone, "seal it. and
take it at once to Melbourne House.
Give it into "William Lamb's hands â to
no one else. Do you understand?"
"Yes, my lady." the other replied, and
left her noiselessly, as Gordon came
slowly down the stair.
"I have left your lordship this even-
Ing's Courier," said Lady Noel, forbid
dingly.
"Thank you," he answered, and look
ed at it carelessly. On its exposed page
a pencil had marked an article of con
siderable length whose title was: "The
Poetical "Works of â  Peer of the Realm,
viewed in connection with Christianity
and the Obligations of Social Life."
x Its final paragraph was underscored
with meaning heaviness:

A simmer of rage ~ rose In Gordon's
throat. He tore the paper twice across,
rlung it down, and passed on to the
drawing-room. Seeing no one, he rang
for th* valet.
"Where is Mr. Sheridan?" he de
manded.
Fletcher was carrying a wine glass
end seemed sur^-ised at the query.
"He was here five minutes ago. your
lordship. Mr. Sheridan looked very bad
when I let him in, sir. I was just
getting him this brandy."
"I suppose he tired of waiting."
thought Gordon. "The Clermoot has a
new part to-night, and Sherry's bound
for ForÂ»s" Alley."
As he buttoned his great coat, he
heard a cry from the valet, and ran
into the drawing-room to find Fletcher
bending over the form of the old wit,
prostrate on the floor, moveless, speech
less, his face swept by a oluish pallor.
"Good God!" cried Gordon. "'Help

"Well, Mr. Holmes?" said he.
But my friend's eyes were fixed upon
the secretary, who stood by his mas
ter's hair.
"I think, your Grace, that I could
speak mere freely In Mr. Wllder's ab
sence."
The man turned a shade paler and
cast a malignant glance at Holmes.
"If your Grace wishes â "
"Yes, yes, you had better go. Now,
Mr. Holmes, what have you to say?"
My friend waited until the door had
closed behind the retreating secretary.
"The fact Is, your Grace.*" said he.
"that my colleague. Dr. Watson, and
myself had an assurance from Dr.
Huxtable that a reward had been of
fered in this case. I should like to
have this confirmed from your own
lips."
"Certainly. Mr. Holmes."
"It amounted, if I am correctly in

"And onoiker thousand to the man

â¢ "Exactly."
"Under the latter heading is included.

sition?"
" "Yes, yes." cried the Duke, impa
tiently. "If you do your work well.
Mr. Sherlock Holmes, you will have no
reason to complain of niggardly treat
ment."
My friend rubbed his thin hands to
gether with an appearance of avidity
vrhich was a surprise to me, who knew
his frugal tastes.
"I fancy that I Fee your . Grace's
check book upon the table," said he.
"I should be glad if you would make
me out a check for Â£6000. It would be
as well, perhaps, for you to cress It.'
The Capital and Counties Bank, Ox
ford street branch, are my agents."
His Grace sat very stern and upright
in his chair, and looked stonily at my
friend.
"Is tills a Joke, Mr. Holmes? It is
hardly a. subject for pleasantry."
"Not at ail. your Grace. I was never
more earnest in my life."
"What do you mean, then?"
"I meai; that I have earned the re

apgresfively red than ever against his

"He ,Is, or was last night, at the

With Fletcher's aid the old man was
placed upon a scfa. and Gordon loosed
the stiff neckerchief, put a cushion
under the recumbent head and chafed
the sick man's hands.
The physlcicn looked grave when he
came.
" A paralytic stroke." he said. "He
must be taken home."
CHAPTER XV.
The Pitfall.
It was later evening. Gordon sat in
the library, the diary in which he had
written those lines to Ada open before
him.
S'.nce the scene with Annabel whose
dark aftermath had been the Illness
of his old friend a deeper sense of pain
had oppressed him. His marriage had
sprung from an inarticulate divining
of the infinite need of his nature for
such a spiritual influence as he had
imagined she pessessed. It had ended
in failure. A mood of hopelessness was
upon him now as he wrote:
"Man is a battle-ground between
angel and devil. Tenderness and
roughness â sentiment, sensibility â
soaring and groveling, dirt and deity â
all mixed in one compound of inspired
clay. Marriage is the hostage he gives
to his better nature. What if this
hostage conspire with his evil side to
betray the citadel?
""Nature made me passionate of tem
per but with an innate tendency to the
love of good in my mainspring of mind.
, Â«1 am an atom jarring between these
great discords. Sympathy is the
divine lifter â the supreme harmonlzer.
And shall that evade me forever?
Where shall I find it? In the
cheap intrigue that absorbs half
the life of those around me? Shall I
turn to the fairest of those blandish
ments, and, like the drunkard, forget
; enury in the hiccough and happi
ness of intoxication?"
The thought of the delicate coquetry
: of Jane Clermont and of the ripe
beauty of Lady Caroline Lamb flashed
across the page, an insistent vision. He
saw the latter's eyes, eager and invit
ing, as he had so often seen them at
Melbourne House, when he had turned
â  from them to a paler beauty. He
thought of a past season when the
i whirlwind of her Infatuation had
wound their two names in gossip that
had never tired. Love with her would
have counted all sacrifice cheap, all
â¢ .cies gossamer. Could such a pas
sion yield him what he craved? Was
s he bound to live pent within the pall
| sade a priest's ceremony had reared
! about him? Of what virtue were honor
. and faith to a bond where love was
â  not?
; But this picture faded as he wrote
. across it the answer to its question:
i "No: I will not. I will keep the
bond. Yet I and the mother of my
i child are far xpart as the two poles!
, I am a toy of inborn unbeliefs, linked
> to unemotional goodness, merciless vir
! tue and Ice-girdled piety. I am asked
to bow down to arcana which to me
. are bagatelles. As well believe in Rob
erts the prophet, or Breslau the con
. Jurer If he had lived in the reign of
Tiberius! The everlasting why which
. stares me In the face is an unforgiv
[ able thing. Yet to yieldâ to go the
broad, easy way of conventional belief
and smug morality â to shackle the
â  doubts I feel! To anchor myself to
the frozen molehills and write, like
other men, glozed comfortable lines on
which friend and foe can batten alike,
. and with which reviewer and reviewee,
rhinoceros and elephant, mammoth
and megalonyx can lie quietly to
gether!"
He threw down his Den and leaned
his forehead in his hands.
"Would to God I had nothing better
The Duke fell back in his chair.
"And whom do you accuse?"
Sherlock Holmes' answer was an as
tounding one. He stepped swiftly for
ward and touched the Duke upon the
shoulder.
"1 accuse you." said he. "And now,
your Grace. I'll trouble you for that
check. "
Never shall I forget the Duke's ap
pearance as he sprang up and clawed
with his hands, like one who is sinking
into en abyss. Then, with an extraor
dinary efifort of aristocratic self-com
mand, he sat down and sank his face
in his hands. It was some minutes be
fore he sooke. ,
"How much do you know?" he asked
at last, without raising his head.
"I saw you together last night."
"Does any one else Desldes your
friend know?"
"I have spoken to no one."
The Duke took a pen in his quivering
fingers and opened his check book.
"I shall be as good as my word, Mr.
Holmes. I am about to write your
check, however unwelcome the infor
mation which you have gained may be
to me. When the offer was first made
I little thought the turn which events
might take. But you and your friend
are men of discretion, Mr. Holmes?"
"I hardly understand your Grace."
'"I must put it plainly, Mr. Holmes.
If only you two know of this incident
there is no reason why it should go any
farther. I think Â£12.000 Is the sum
that I owe you, is it not?"
But Holmes smiled and shook his
head.
"I f Â»ar, your Grace, that matters can
hardly be arranged so easily. There
Is the death of this schoolmaster to be
accounted for."
â  But James knew nothing of that.
You cannot hold him responsible for
that. It was the work of this brutal
ruffian whom he had the misfortune to
employ."
"I must take the view, your Grace,
that when a man embarks upon a
crime he is morally guilty of any other
crime which may spring from it."
' Morally. Mr. Holmes. No doubt you
are right. But surely not in the eyes
of the law. A man cannot be condemn
ed for a murder at which he was not
present, and which he loathes and ab
hors as much as you do. The Instant
that he hea-d it he made a complete
confession to me, so filled was he with
horror and remorse. He lo3t not an
hour In breaking entirely with the mur
derer. Oh, Mr. Holmes, you must save
him â you must save him! I tell you
that you must save him!" The Duke
had dropped the last attempt at self
command, and was pacing the room
with a convulsed face and with his
clenched hands raving in the air. At
last he mastered himself and sat down
once more at his desk. "I appreciate
your conduct in coming here before you
spoke to any one else," said he. "At
THE SAN FRANCISCO SUNDAY CALL.
in this soul of mine!" he exclaimed.
"The rest of the world can game and
kiss and besot themselves in peace.
Only Iâ lâ must writhe and struggle
unsatisfied!"
"There is a carboy outside, your
lordship, who wishes to see you."
"A carboy!" Gordon raised his head.
"What does he want?"
"He says he has a message for your
lordship's own hands. He's a likely
lcoking lad."
"Very well, show him in. Hasn't
Rushton returned from Mr. Sheridan's
yet?" he added.
"Yes. my lord. But Lady Noel sent
him out again with a letter for Sir
Ralph to his club."
Gordon heaved a sigh of relief.
"Sherry must be better," he thought.
He waited on the threshold till Fletch
er ushered in a slim figure In the round
coat and buttons of a carman. His
chin was muffled in a coarse necker
chief, and a rumpled mass of brown
hair showed beneath the edges of the
cloth cap, whose visor was pulled over
his eyes.
"Well, my lad?"
The boy stood stllL twisting his
fingers in his jacket till the valet
had retired. Then suddenly as the
door closed, the cap was snatched
off, a mass of brown, hair dropped
curling about the boyish shoulders
âthe sliver-buttoned jacket fell
open, revealing a softly rounded
throat and delicate slope of breast.
Gordon uttered an astonished and be
wildered exclamation:
"Caro! "\\ hat mad masquerade is
this?"
She drew back under the pale in
tensity, the controlled agitation of his
face, "Forgive me! forgive me!" Tu
mult was looking from her eyes and
her shoulders were heaving. "I could
not help It! I have tried to forget
you during all this past year. I can
not bear to see you only at Melbourne
House and at parties and on the
street. How pale you always are!" she
v.?nt on. "Like a statue of marble,
and your dark hair such a contrast! I
never see you without wanting to cry.
If any painter could paint me your face
as it is 1 would give anything I pos
sess!"
She had touched his hand, but ha
drew it away sharply, feeling a black
sense of entanglement in the touch.
"Lady Caroline! This is unthink
able! To come here in that dress
here, to this house, is sheer madness!
I did not imagine you capable of such
folly!"
"You think I am weak and selfish,"
she pleaded. "You have always
thought I did not struggle to with
stand my feelings. But indeed, indeed,
it is more than human nature can
bear! 1 loved you before you married
Bella â loved you better than name,
than religion, than any prospects oji
tarth! You must have loved me more
if you had never seen her! She has
never cared for you as I do."
He darted a glance at the door. His
wife! A rebellious anser.rose In him
at being thrust into such a predica
ment.
"You have taken a strange way to
show that love."
' "Oh, I could show it other ways!"
: She was looking at him with tremu
lous daring. "They used to say that
once in the East, to prove to a Greek
â  girl that you loved her you wounded
>ourself in the breast. Would such a
thing make you believe how I love
you ?"
At that moment both heard a voice
in the hallway.
"Bella!" he said in,a whisper.
'"Oh. I thought she had gone to Sea
ham," she breathed. "'You must be
!ieve I did not know she was here!"
She buttoned the coat over her breast
with" nervous I'ngers and put. on the
cloth cap. The sound had thrown her
into a paroxysm of dread.
least, we may take counsel how far
we can minimize this hideous scandal."
" "Exactly." said Holmes. "I think,
your Grace, that this can only be done
by absolute frankness between us, I
am disposed to help your Grace to the
best of my ability, but, in order to do
so. I must understand to the last de
tail how the matter stands. I realize
that your words applied to Mr. James
Wilder, and that he is not the mur
derer."
x "No. the murderer has escaped."'
Sherlock Holmes smiled demurely.
"Your Grace can hardly have heard
of any small reputation which I pos
sess, or you would not Imagine that it
is so easy to escape me. Mr. Reuben
Hayes was arrested at Chesterfield on
my information, at 11 o'clock last night.
1 had a telegram from the head of the
local police before I left the school this
morning."
The Duke leaned back In his chair
and stared with amazement at my
friend.
"You seem to have powers that are
hardly human." said he. "So Reuben
Hayes is taken? I am right glad to
hear it, if it will not react upon the
fate of James."
"Your secretary?"
"No, sir, my son."
It was Holmes' turn to look aston
ished.
"I confess that this is entirely new to
me, your Grace. I must beg you to be
more explicit."
"I will congeal nothing from you. I
agree with you that complete frank
ness, however painful it may be to me,
is the best policy In this desperate sit
uation to which Junes' folly and jeal
ousy have reduced us. When I was a
very young man. Mr. Holmes, I loved
wttta Ruch a love as comes only once
in a lifetime. I offered the lady mar
riage, tut she refused it on the grounds
that such a match might mar my ca
reer. Had she Jived, I would certainly
never have married any one else. She
died and left this one child, whom for
her sake I have cherished and cared
for. I could not acknowledge the pa
ternity to the world, but I gave him
the bfst of educations, and since he
came to manhood I have kept him near
my person. He surprised my secret,
and has presumed ever since upon the
claim which he has upon me, and upon
his power of provoking a scandal
which would be abhorrent to me. His
presence had something to do with
the unhappy issue of my marriage.
Above all. he hated my young legiti
mate heir from the flrst with a persist
ent hatred. You may well ask me why,
under these circumstances, I still kept
James under my roof. I answer that
it was because I could see his moth
er's face in his, and thai for her dear
sake there was no end to my long
suffering. All her pretty ways tooâ
there was not one of them which he
could not suggest and bring back to my
memory. I could not send him away.
But I feared so much lest he should do

"Quick! quick!" she urged.
"Not that way. Here, to the garden
entrance. ' He caught her hand, drew
her sharply toward the rear door and
opened it.
The retreat was closed. Lady Noel,
sparkling eyes and spare figure,
leaning on her cane, faced* them at the
threshold, her gaze leaping with flick
ering triumph. At the same instant
Annabel entered by the other door.
The trap had sprung, the joints were
working with precision. Gordon's first
glance at his wife's face told him there
had been betrayal, for the look he saw
v.as not of surprise or wonder, though
, its indignant lines set themselves deep
er in presence of the visible fact.
The jaws of this trap had been set by
accident. How had Lady Noel and
Annabel guessed 0 The latters eyes
were on the carboy's costume, as If
she would convince herself doubly by
every evidence of her senses. The grim
figure on the threshold pointed one
tnin forefinger at the shrinking form
In the boy's dress.
"Take off that cap!"
Annabel took a quick step forward,
as Lady Caroline snatched off the cov
ering to show a face flaming with de
fiance. "Caro!" she exclaimed â
"Caro!"
As she looked from one to the other
contempt rose in a frigid wave over
her features and she drew herself up
to her full height and stood stonily
erect.
Lady Noel laughed with an echoing
amusement, as Lady Caroline burst
out in a torrent:
"You can hate and despise me if you
want to, Bella. It can make no dif
ference to me. Why did you come be
tween us in the first place ? You never
loved him, at least. .You had nothing
to give him but that horrible virtuous
indifference of yours â nothing! noth
ing! You have nothing to give him
now. You have made his life wretch
ed with your perfectness and your
conventions! Everybody knows that!"
Annabel's look swept her with its
sharp etjge of scorn; then flashed on
Gordon, who stood composed, motion
less, in a grip of repression.
"Is it not enough for you to have
made me the butt of your dally caprice,
your shameless atheism?" â she drove
the words at her husband â "for all
; London to gossip of your social 'con
quests' and your dissolute affairs? Is
this not enough â that you offer me the
final dishonor of such planned meet
ings, under this roof?"
'â  "It was not his fault!" cried Lad '
Caroline. "Bella! I will tell you the
truth!"
1 Gordon put out his hand with a ges
ture of protest as Lady Noel laughed
again, musically, maliciously.
A knock at the door silenced all
voices. It heralded Fletcher, whose
eyes, habitually discreet, seemed to see
no farther than his master.
I "Mr. Somers is outside, sir, with the
i Melbourne coach, to wait for Lady
Caroline Lamb."
i Lady Caroline's 7 blank, terror-struck
i eyes turned to Gordon, and she began
â¢ to tremble. She ran and pulled aside
the portiere from the window. She
â¢ shrank back with a gasping cry, for
she recognized the coach drawn up at
' the curb, whose lighted lanterns, re
flected from fawn-covered panels em
: blazoned with the Melbourne arms, lit
: plainly the figure of William Lamb's
I confidential factotum waiting by its
. step. Her husband had known she was
i coming there! He bad sent Somers in
stead of the coachman â he even knew
! of the carboy's dress!
A slow change passed over her face.
Fesr-and dread had shown there an
instant pcllidly â dread of the malig
â  nant fury she knew lay couched b-e
' neath the cold exterior of her husband;

chief. that I dispatched him for safety
to Dr. Huxtable's Bchool.
"James came into contact with this
fellow Hayes, because the man was a
tenant of mine, and James acted as
agent. The fellow was a rascal from
the beginning but, in some extraordi
nary way, James became Intimate with
him. He had always a taste for low
company. When James determined to
kidnap Lord Saltire, it was of this
man's service that he availed himself.
You remember that I wrote to Arthur
upon that last day. Well. James open
ed the letter and inserted a note ask
ing Arthur to meet him In a little
wood called the Ragged Shaw, which
Is near to the school. He used the
Duchess' name, and in that way got
the boy to come. That evening James
bicycled ov*r â I am telling you what he
has himsel* confessed to me â and he
told Arthur, whom he met in the woods,
that his mother longed to see him,
that she was awaiting him on the
moor, and that if he would come back
into the wood At midnight he would
find a man with a horse, who would
take him to her. Poor Arthur fell
into the trap. He came to the ap
pointment., and found this fellow Hayes
with a led peny. Arthur mounted, and
they set off together. It appears â
though this James only heard yester
day â that they were pursued, that
Hayes struck the pursuer with his
stick, and that the man died of his
Injuries. Hayes brought Arthur to
his public-house, the Fighting Cock.
where he was confined in an upper
room, under the care of Mrs. Hayes,
who ie a kindly woman, but entirely
under the control of her brutal hus
band.
"Well, Mr. Holmes, that was the
state of affairs when I flrst saw you
two days ago. I had no more idea of
the truth than you. You will ask me
what was James' motive in doing such
a deed. I answer that there was a
great deal which was unreasoning and
fanatical in the hatred which he bore
my h^lr. In his view he should him
self have been heir of all my estates,
and he deeply resented those social
laws which made it impossible. At the
same time, he had a definite motive
also. He was eager that I should
break the entail, for he was of opinion
that It lay In my power to do so. He
intended to make a bargain with me â
to restore Arthur if I would break the
entail, and so make It possible for the
estate to be left to him by will. Ha
knew well that I should never willingly
invoke the aid of the police against
him. I say that he would have pro
posed such a bargain to me; but he
did not actually do so. for events moved
too quickly for him. and he had not
time to put his plans Into practice.
"What brought all his wicked scheme
to wreck was your discovery of this
man Heidegger's dead body. James
was seized with horror at the news.
It came to us yesterday, as we sat to
gether in this study. Dr. Huxtable
had sent a telegram. James was so
upon Gordon.
"So!" she said in a stifled voice. "You
sent my letter to my husband: You
did not count on a scene with Bella â
but for me who have bored you, you
tcok this cruel way to end it all! Well,
you have succeeded. Now I know
Madame de Stael was right when she

now I hate you. I hate you!"
He made no reply. Her letter? As
she spoke he had had a vision of Mrs.
Clermont's noiseless movements and
thin secret mouth, and suspicion clog
ged his tongue.
Lady Caroline looked at him an in
stant with a shudder as she passed
out. "I shall always hate you," she
said with vengeful emphasis. They
heard the outer door close heavily be
hind her and the dulled sound of
wheels.
As Gordon turned again to meet his
wife's flinty gaze, the footman ap
peared.
"Sir Ralph wished me to say he
would answer at once, your ladyship,"
he said to Lady Noel.
"There was no change "in Mr. Sheri
dan's condition, Rushton?" asked
Gordon.
"Change, my lord?" the boy stam
mered. 'Why, Iâ r" He looked from
him to the others, his jaw dropped.
Lady Noel shifted her cane. "I re
ceived Rushton's report. I thought It
a pity anything should Interfere with
your lordships evening engagement."
"Mr. Sheridan was thought to be dy
ing, my lord," said the boy, "and had
asked for you."
v CHAPTER XVI.
The Despoiling.
As his hackney-coach sped through
the night Gordon's anger at the in
humanity that had kept from him the
sick man's message faded gradually
Into a duller resentment that held most
of grief.
The words of his wife recurred to his
mind: "A doddering old man!" She
had seen only the uncertain walk, the
trembling hand, the dying down of the
brilliance and fire into crumbling ashes.
Not the past, the career in Parliament,
the masterly craft of the playwright,
the years of loyalty to his friends.
Social morality had been fC lifelong
jest to Sheridanâ s. veritable "School
for Scandal" from which he drew his
choicest bon-mots, yet his whole char
acter had been sweetened with the milk
of human kindness. Annabel walked
a moral princess of parallelograms, vi
ciously virtuous, mercilessly inflexible.
"And the greatest cf these is char
ity" â whose was it? Annabel's or
Sheridan's?
On the steps of St. Dunstan's-in-the-
West stood Dr. Cassidy with his friend,
the under-curate, and he caught a
glimpse of the coach that whirled by.
"Yonder," said Cassidy, 'rides Lon
don's poet -apostate, known by his limp
and his profligacy. The devotees are
tiring. How long can the Idol stand?"
The other turned to gaze. "Woe unto
you, when all men shall speak well of
you!" he quoted, "for so did their fa
thers to the false prophets!" He also
was a sanctimonious young man.
The house that sheltered the old wit
v.as dark as Gordon ascended the
steps, and the hollow echoes from the
knocker, reverberating through the
hall, chilled him with dread. "He
died an hour ago, your lordship," the
servant said.
An hour! And but for the delay, he
would have been in time! As Gordon
entered, a prey to this reflection, a
thick-set man dressed shabbily, as
cended the steps. He had once been
the dead man's groom, he explained,
and begged awkwardly to be allowed
to look upon his face. The servant
hesitated, but at the grief In the
overwhelmed with grief and agitation
that my suspicions, which had never
been entirtly absent, rose instantly to
a certainty, and I taxed him with the
deed. He made a complete voluntary
confession. Then he implored me to
keep his secret for three days longer,
so as to give his wretched accomplice
a chance of saving his guilty life. I
yielded â as I have always yielded â to
his prayers, and instantly James hur
ried off to the Fighting Cock to warn
Hayes and give him the means of
lllght. I could not go there by day
light without provoking comment, but
as soon as night fell I hurried off to
Â»cc my dear Arthur. I found him safe
and wel, but horrified beyond expres
sion by the dreadful deed he had wit
nessed. In deference to my promise,
and much against my will. I consented
to leave him there for three days, un
der the charge of Mrs. Hayes, since it
was evident that it was Impossible to
inform the police where he was without
telling them also who was the murder
er, and I could not see how that mur
derer could be punished without ruin
to my unfortunate James. You asked
for frankness. Mr. Holmes, and I have
taken you at your word, for I have
low told you everything without an at
tempt at circumlocution or conceal
. ment. Dc ycu in your turn be as frank
with me?"
"I will." said Holmes.* "In the flrst
place, your Grace, I am bound to tell
you that you have placed yourself in
a most serious position in the eyes of
the law. You have condoned a felony,
and you have aided the escape of a
murderer, for I cannot doubt that any
money which was taken by James Wil
der to aid his accomplice in his flight
came from your Grace's purse."
The Duke bowed his assent.
"This i^ indeed, a most serious mat
ter. Even more culpable in my opin
ion, your Grace, te your attitude toward
your younger so-i. You leave him in
this cien for three days."'
"Under solemn promises â "
"What are promises to such people
as these? You have no guarantee that
he will not be spirited away again. T->
humor your guilty elder son you have
exposed your innocent younger son to
imminent and unnecessary danger. It
was a most unjustifiable action."
The prÂ«ud lord of Holdernesse was
not accustomed to be so rated in his
Â«>wn ducal hall. The blood flushed into
his hijih forehead, but his conscience
held him dumb.
â¢ I wi:l help you, but on one condition
only. It is that you ring for the foot
man, and let me give such orders as I
like."
"W ithovit a word, the Duke pressed the
electric bell. A servant entered.
"You will be glad to hear." said
Holmes, '"that your young master isÂ»
found. It is the Duke's desire that the
carriage shal! go at once to the Fight
ing Cock Inn to bring Lord Saltire
home.
"Now," said Holmes, when the re
joicing lackey had disappeared, "hay

new-comer pushed quickly past Gor

There his profound emotion van
ished. He drew a bailiff's wand from
benfath his coat and touched the ngid
figure that lay there, proclaimed with
gruff triumph: "I arrest this body ia

' Come with me," rasped Gordon
' between his teeth, and the bailiff fol

from his pocket a draft from John
Murray, his publisher, for 480 gum

â¢ and handed it to the bailiff, who scru
tinized it and counted out the Â£4

"Now gol" said Gordon.
The clock of St. Paul's was pealing
â¢ the hour of 11 as the hackney coach
I drove back to the house on Piccadilly
terrace. A light, low-lying mist soit
â¢ ened the outlines of the alley ways
i and purified the filth of the street.
Overhead it frayed into a night of
â¢ wonderful starshine, where, beyond

While the wheels rattled onward

to those presences above the smoky
roofs, gradually lost its bitter glaze
and expressed a curious wistfulness â
a vague, appealing weariness and
speculation.
"Matter is eternal," he reflected.

â¢ eternal. May not mind be also? Is
â¢ its inner spark celestial? Or, like the
t cells that produce it. is it a creature
. of the mold, doomed to extinction

flame perishes when the wick falls?
i I remember when I viewed the plan
! ets through Herschel's telescope and
( saw all at once that they were worlds.
1 What has eternity to do with the con- ,
gregated cosmic dust we call man
i kind? What are our little passions
i and resentments before the least of
â¢ those stars ?"
I His gaze and his thought fell from
the sky.
Had he any right to the stubborn
pride which would not bemean itself
I by self-defense? Would his own si
l lence not abet the calculating hatred
â¢ of Lady Noel and add to that mon
strous estrangement that was 3tea:
.â¢rying his soul further and further
" from the soul of Annabel? The
question of whether his wife believe!
â  or disbelieved aside, was he justified
> in such a course now? A softer feel
1 ing took possession of him. Appear
ances had been against him. To
â  speak could make the matter no
â¢ worse for Lady Caroline. He would
' go to Annabel and assure her of the
truth. Perhaps even out of such a
' catastrophe as to-night's might arise
f a truer and a nearer confidence.
He threw off his great-coat in the
Â» empty hall and ascended the stair.
The door of the chamber where sat
t the little white bed was oj>en. H^
i went in. The lamp still shed its radi

With a puzzled look he tore it open.
i A white anguish spread over his ,

"I understand that. Mr. Holmes, and
it is already settled that he shall leave
me forever, and go to seek his fortune
in Australia."
"In that case, your Grace, since you
have yourself stated that any unhap
piness in your married life was caused
by his presence. I would suggest that
you make such amends as you can to
the Duchess, and that you try to re
sume those relations which have been

"That also I have arranged. Mr.
Holmes. I wrote to the Duchess this
morning."
"In that case." said Holmes, rising.
'I think that my friend and I can Con
gratulate ourselves upon several most
happy results from our little visit to
the north. There is one other small
point upon which I desire some light.
This fellow Hayes had shod his horses
with shoes which counterfeited the
tracks of cots. Was It from Mr. Wil
der that he learned so extraordinary a
device?"'
The Duke stood In thought for a mo
ment, with a look of intense surprise
on his face. Then he opened a door
and showed us into a large room fur
nished as a museum. He led the way
to a glass case in a corner, and pointed
to the inscription:
"These shoes." it ran. "were dug up
in the moat of Holdernesse Hall. They,

the glass. "It is the second most In

end when a cool breeze drifted through
the doors the one-lunger's eyes turned
to the outer dark, for there, under the
night. the hills wereâ the most high,
the secret places that were for him
the promise of life. To-night they
were high and far enough; so very far
that to the one-lungrer the wind from
the canyons scarce stirred the air of
the dance hall. Alf Heyman, shirt
sleeved, indolent, caressed a stack of
' checks^ with his long fingers" at the
table where four i rallroaod graders
watched the deal, Idly monosyllabic,
â¢ yet alert before the gamekeeper.
The air indeed at Wiggin's was not
* good; the night's reek inherited the
day's heaviness, for night or day the
house did not close, and from week to
week the thin drift of smoke hung:
about the huge kerosene lamps under
the rafters before it filtered out above
the green baize doors.
Before the mirror, Billy Be-Dain was
arranging a gay red neckscarf ; he ran
his fingers through the hair that stood
up like a forest of magnetized Iron 1
filings across his round post of a head
â a final flourish to his groomingâ and
remarked, as one concluding an Irre
futable argument:
"It's as I'm telUn* youâ if a man's
a barkeep, let him be a good barkeep;
and if -religion's the play, let. him go
the limit. But you sure can't mix re
ligion with the sort of whisky that the
Deacon shoots across this slab!"
Deacon "Wlggin laid down the new
almanac he had been perusing and sur
veyed his establishment from the bar
to the dance hall; from thÂ« ehirt
eleeved gamekeeper to the piano player
whose â¢Jim fingers strayed over the
keys with Just thÂ« ghost of a bar
from Mendelssohn's "Spring Song"
stealing through the gray land's outer
silence.
"I thought once of bein' a preacheh,"
mused the Deacon. "I've seen pow*fal
exhorttn' on worse whisky than these
bar goods, back In Tennessee. If a
man's fitten, he's fitten; and If he's

The green baize doors burst open. A
woman was in the square of starlight,
a? a red flower against black velvet;
fttllrbosomed, imperious â her giants
bullied them, contempt was In the tots
.if her head; but her challenge was ig
nored. The most reckless grader in
campâ sheepherder, miner, follower of
the gamesâ none tvould bait Wiggin's
daughter. Billy Be-Dam became pre
occupied; Slim York ceased his idle
tapping; Deacon Wiggin's eyes foil and
wf-nt uneasily back to his tables.
The piano player's pale face flushed;
his too unhealthy bright eyea had been
fixed above the screen at the sweep
of starlight over the hills. The air of
Wyoming might have been good for
the one-lunger, but not such air as he
breathed nightly at the piano between
Alf Heyman's table and the dance hall
door. But the one-lunger was broke
ar.d not chooser of fortune. His eyes,
wiih their nervous glitter, fell from the
outer dark to Wiggin's Madge; his
white fingers slowly felt over the key
board in the "Spring Song."
"Slavin's here," muttered the Dea
con, "with the camp'g.pay for the
month."
The girl drew back with an out
pointing of her chin.
"What's that to me?" she cried.
"Who-all cares 2"
"No harm, Madge, girl," murmured
tho Deacon, entreatlngly. "The con
tractor's money is good â but if he
wants v> Play it, with you, it's a good
thing for the house â a ve'y good thing
for the house!"
"If you want Slavin's money, rob

menacingly, "is this why I â¢ was brung

Deacon Wiggin sighed gently as ha
turned away.
"Flavin won't play high unless

he won't touch the layout without her.

sOiot darkling glances of hostility at
them. The one-lunger let his song
die away. His pallor flushed;, it was
as if he drank in life from the fine
power of her womanhood; superbly
strong was she, radiating the electric
thrill of health and passion as a full
blown rose of red its perfume. When
her angry eyes feU to the one-lung
er's slender hands it was as if some
pity of motherhood stirred at his
â weakness, and the rebel scorn- of her
bearing knelt to this tenderness.
"Play It," she whispered, and the
pianist's hands tuched the keys once
more in the "Spring Song."
At midnight Wiggin's place was fill
ing. A murmur of voices arose above
the clicking of chips and glasses. In
the dance hall a Mexican woman â was
singing "La Golondrina" to a ranch
man, half-asleep. One of the specta
tor's at Alf Heyman's table sauntered
to the front of the house. His weak
blue eyes twinkled good-humoredly,
but there was irresolution in the chin
and mouth of Slavin. the boss and
contractor for the cutoff grading.
"Hello, Deacon," said he. "Where's
Madge? I can't play without her."
"She's In a tempeh," sulked the Dea
con. "She's not born to the short
grass country â she's thlnkun of heh
horne â and Tennessee."
Slavin was to be "braced" that
night, but he knew his weakness as
well as did the men who had not
studied him for nothing. He had the
month's pay for his laborers; he wag
watchful and suspicious â the game
lay alone with the girl whose flame of
beauty had caught the contractor's
â¢ye^ â whom, he had boasted, he would
stake to-night to "break" the house.
And to-night Wiggin's Madge, ob
stinately minded, would only Bit by the
piano and refuse to entertain or be
diverted. A long hour Slim idled over
his soda, and Slavin waxed loquacious
over his whisky, while the hum of life
lilled the rooms. The piano player
swept the instrument now into a rol
licking ragtime; now Into a hack
ballad of the theaters; now Into some
song that held a master's soul, which
was that the one-lunger loved the
best.
It v:an in a simple Mexican dance,
carelessly played, and yet with the
nameless pathos which was in every
thing the one-lunger did, that the
listeners made out a long exultknt
crescendo of sweetness, transcending
the air until the musician himself
heard it and stilled his fingers. Out
upon the night â full-throated, insist
ent, rising and then darting to low
thrills as if reproving its own glad
ness, came the song of a bird.
The Idlers at the bar were hushed;
it seemed Â«nÂ» if the moving of a hand
Would crush this melody. The woman
by the piano suddenly threw the doors
wide. On the steps was a small boy
in blue, with a red band about his cap,
who held a birdcage with one finger
through the ring. Not a note did the
Bongster cease, pouring its golden li

Agamemnon G. Jones. Aggy was a bis,
fine-looking man, with a chest like a
dry-goods box and a set of whiskers
that would start hftn in business any

would be so pleased that he would
fork out an extra ten; but if he was
plainly vented as one of the boys there
would be Just enough pay in the re
turn to encourage him,
"Next he took up engineering. He
hit a blame good Job on Castle Creek,
in the Black Hills. The people wanted
to turn the creek through a tunnel, so
that they could work the bed, and at

three-quarters of a mile long, the bot
tom prong being at least a hundred
and fifty feet below the water level on
the top one â a smashing good fall â so
Appy started in on the down side to
bore the hole up.
"Well, everything went lovely. He'd
come arounÂ«i with his plans and speci
fications twice a day and draw his
hundred once a week regular for his
great labors. At last, however, the
shift-boss said they must bn getting
pretty near water; he <^>uld hear it
roar through the face of the tunnel, he
said. But Aggy told him not to be
alarmed; he had it all worked out, and
they weren't within forty foot of
breaking through.
"So at it they went again, as cheer
ful as could be, and the next news they
got down comes the face/ and they
were being piped through four hun
dred foot of black, dark tunnel, trying
to guess what was up, bumping and
banging against the walls and the
whole of Castle Creek on top of them.
"My Chinamen weren't a circum-
stance. Aggy said they boiled out of
the lower end of the tunnel, where he
was standing, so fast he couldn't
recognize them, and. as a matter of
fact, three or four of 'em were washed
a mile down the creek before they
could make land.
"Aggy gathered that it was time to
move again, so he pulled back for Ida
ho. There wasn't anybody really
drowned, except old Tom Olley, a cou
sin-Jack, whose only amusement in life
was to wear out his pants laying low
for cinches In the stud-poker game,
and you couldn't rightly Bay he was
any loss to the community. So Aggy
used to regret sometimes that he
hadn't stayed to face the music. They
might have played horse with him for
a while, but 'twould soon have blown
over â miners not being revengeful by
nature â and he was to have had an
eighth interest, besides his salary, if
the thing was a success.
"But there was no good of crying
over spilt milk, and us two went pros
pecting.
"We located for a permanent stand
down on Frenchman's Creek, near
where three of Cap AUys* greaser
â heepherders had their camp. They
did our hunting for us, and as there
was nobody but them around, and they
were the peacefulest people In the
world, we didn't feel the need of any
run exoept Ag"s old six-shooter. That
was the cussedest machine that ever
rot Invented by man.
"When you pulled her off she'd spit
fire In all directions, filling the crotch
of your hand with powder burns, and
sometimes two or three of the loads
would re off at once, when she'd kick
like a Texas steer. There was much
talk of bear around, and we were al
ways going to buy a real gun some
day, but we never rot at It.
"Well, we prospered pretty well, con
sidering how little we worked. A large
part of the time was taken up with
playing monte with the herders, and
still more in arguing questions about
religion and things like that; but we
had a decent cabin builtâ with the kind
assistance of the herders-*-and as we
â track a rich little streak that run out
$10 per man a day with no trouble at
all we were in clover.
"At last our stock of grub ran low,
and Jones slid up to Salmon City to
load up again. It was quite a trip, and
as I didn't think it was square to work
while Aggy was away, I took up with
the herders. They were the decentest
folk I ever struck. Play a little music
on the guitar, sing songs that always
wound up Just where a white man's
songs would begin, and tell stories and
smoke cigarettes â that was the layout
for them. Old Cap* AJlys was a Chris
tian, and he wouldn't let a man herd
sheep al! by himself â surest way to get
crazy that ever was inventedâ so he
sent the boys out three in a bunch.
"Tliose fellers had the darndest lot
of fairy tales I ever did hear. And
superstitious! Great Jupiter! Any little
blame thing that happened meant
something: this thing was good luck;
that meant bad, and if you tried to josh
them out of it, they'd shake their heads
and look at you as if they thought
you weren't truly religious.
"One of their yarns was about El
Diablo de Fuego, 'The Devil of Fire,'
which Miguel said ran in his family.
Seems that when anything wrong was
about to happen, this blazing, ripping
monster showed up as a warning. I
told Mcc that I thought the monster
was misfortune enough,* without any

from the looks of the wagon 'he'd

astonished, but I must admit that some

asking, 'What in is this, Ag?' and
he always answered, 'Ask the driver.'
Well, now, if there was any choice be

â¢ N'i.w,' thinks I, 'if I can only get
that gun before he sees me and if the
cussed thing will only do the right
thing by me this once!'
"So out I steps, and the first rattle
out of the box I stumbled on a few
dozen of the purchases Ag had brought
home, and down them and me came
like an earthquake. It scart the bear
so he drew back; no use trying to work
a sneak now. I Jumped for the hol
ster, unlimbered, and turned the gun
looee for general results. I guess every
load went off from the noise and she
flew out of my hand and vanished be
hind me. Lord! The place was full of
smoke and the plunder that was scat
tered around so you could neither see,
nor walk, and that bear was swatting
the door in a fashion that showd he
was going to give us a rail any old
how, and I was plumb distracted â for
the life of me I didn't know what to do.
" 'Don't make such a damn noise!"
growls Aggy.
"'You'd better get out of that!' I
yells. 'You'll get noise enough in a
minute!' But he didn't pay the least
attention.
"Just before the door went down I
broke for the cock-loft; it was the only
spot that seemed to hold the teeniest
bit of safety. I dim up the wall like
a hopper-grass, but I had no more than
made it when my friend was in the
house. 'Twas me he wanted to. see. too,
apparently; for he never noted any
thing else, but headed straight for the
loft. I had kind of hoped the other
two would amuse him for a while, but
it wasn't to be. With the door down,
the moonlight streamed In so it was
'most as light as day.
" 'Keep your big feet off me!' says
Ag. very indignant, as the bear walked
on him. It's a great thing not to know
who you're talking to sometimes.
"Well, brother bear upends himself,
and reaches for the loft. He could Just
nicely hook his front toenalls on the
board- and when I saw that I would
huve sold myself out hide and hair and
good will of the business extremely
reasonable. 'Here's where my esteemed
friend Hydraulic Smith gets piped out.'
I thought, and I tried to meet my fin
ish like a man, but there was some
thing about winding up as filler for a
dirty, smelly bear wrapper that took
all the poetry out of the situation.
"I saw that Aggy had got onto the
state of affairs at last; he was crawling
backward very cautions, and he had a
look of pained surprise on his face that
beat anything I'd ever seen on the phla
of man or beast before. For all I was
so scart that I was sweating Icicles I
couldn't help but snicker. Howaom
ever, at that moment brother bear
threw his weight on the board and she
snapped like a toothpick, and my
merry smile took a walk. Lord, I was
in a desperate fix! He had only to
keep on pulling down boards to the
last one, and then, of course, I'd come
down with it.
"Something had to be done. I
grabbed a sack of flour and heaved it
at him; the sack caught on a splinter
and ripped, so beyond covering him

JL they knew they rejoiced In, and
what they did not know was not worth

of satisfaction with self. Among them

minded them of his forecast. When he
missed it. he said nothing. In many
of life* departments great reputations
have bun made In ' this way.
The conversation had turned into its
accustomed bypaths, and it appeared ,
that there was nothing more to be said
on any conceivable subject when old
l.im Jucklin remarked, addressing Hen

that?"
"Well. I don't know as I have," old
Henry replied, reaching over and pull
ing out the damper of the stove. "But
what's your pint of view?"
"It's just this: Almost from the very
beginnln' of the world, the wisest of men
have said that a democracy couldn't
exist for any great length of time.
Nearly every republic had begun with
blood, and all of them had ended with
â¢ failure. And when the American Gov

It was not established,. They knew that
it was an experiment, and they pointed
to history to prove it, and history nod
ded and said, 'Ah, hah, that's a fact.'
When our war came they cried out.
Here you are.' And it seemed that
we were to fly off into jagged frag

time that republics were merely the
dreams of idle men. It seemed to be
the world's final test. But we came
through it all. more cemented than ever

looked at us and said: 'Well, we'll be

y-f AMES HENRY was a chronic hu-
I morist. He joked because he
\ couldn't help 'it. Now joking Is
f%\ like many other habits; it grows
on one. and about the only way
â¦o cure it Is by the application of a
sharp ax Just abaft the ears. James
Henry had it in its worst form. He
was the sort of man who could have
found something: amusing in the
gressional Record or a daily treasury,
report., and could oven discover cause
for laughter in the comic supplement
of a Sunday paper.
It must not be thought, however,
that James Henry .was only a Joker.
In addition to being a persistent pur
veyor of. humor, he was the owner and
operator of a first-class, high-power
cerebellum worthy of a better use than
that to which he 'frequently put it. It
is not our intention to deride or belit
tle the- occupation of the humorist.
Even he has his - uses, although it
would.be difficult to say -at this mo

worth having for the sake of increas
ing other people's satisfaction with
their own dull, mediocre seriousness, if
for no other reason. If we were all
brilliant and sparkling, - this world
would be too much of a constant
Fourth of July celebration for comfort.
However, as we said before. James
Henry was possessed of a very useful
article In the way of an Intellect. He
was also the general business manager
of a fair-sized Income, left to hia.ten
der mercies by his father, whose only
idea of a joke had been to catch a man
throne, but the one that redeemed the
world stood at the work-bench. The
time is comin" when the whole earth
will be Americanized. Every great book
that ;; man reads helps along this idea.
Yes, sir, there's comin' a time when a
man will be ashamed to live in a coun
try where he's called a subject instead
of a citizen. I wish I had a chance to
-talk to every school boy in the world.
I'd impress these facts on his mind."
"YeF," replied old Henry, "but it
Beetna to me that these fellers in the
Bast are a-tryin' to make a monarchy
Of this country as fast as they can."
"Looks that way," Jucklin ad
mitted, "but you might jiltet as well
say that a tricklin' spring branch is
about to make the ocean fresh. All
the power on the face of the earth
couldn't make a monarchy of this
country. But speakin' about bein' a
Yankee, do you remember old Sam
Hesbitt? Of course you do. Well,
just about the time the war got well
under wav old Sam took it into his
head that he ought to come over to
my house and kill me to help things
along. He had raised a squad of fel
lers and they wantc-d to make a name
for themselves. So one night when
the moon was a-shinin' here they
came. I had got wind of it and was
on the lookout. I'd been mustered
into the service and was stayin' home
a few days to straighten things oijt
a little. And I wasn't sleeping down
in the parlor. I was in the garret,
I tell you; and I looked out and saw
the pang a-comin'. There wasn't any
chance to get away, and I lay low and
waited. Pretty soon they came a-thun
d.erin' a* the door. My wife let 'em
in They asked where I was and she
said she didn't know. She didn't, ex
actly â didn't know which corner of
the garret I was hidin' in. Old Sam
Mowed that he was glad I wasn't in
the house, for he was goin' to set
fire to it and that it would be a shame
for a man to be burnt v:> in his own
house.
"When 1 heard this I sorter caught
my breath, and so cold a chill ran up
my back that it was ail I oould do to
keep from sneezin'. My wife told him
that thÂ«? house was old and would
bum easily. It had been our inten
tion to build a. new one and that if
he set it afire it would save the trou
ble of tearin' it down. There was a
pot of coffee on the fire. Now coffee
was a scarce article and when the
perfume of it began to arise, old Sam
he began to sniff. He asked her if
it was Lincoln coffee, all other sort
bein' made of rye or potatoes and
such like. She told him it was and

on the wrong side of the market. A
very crude sense of humor, the old man
had. but it served its turn. With
James Henry, however, the case was
very different. He had money enough
t<- i-naule him to cultivate the finer arts
and graces of life, or at least he
thought that he had.
By virtue of the fact that his father
had left him in sole control of large
gobs of stock and bonds and other vul
gar evidences of sordid wealth. James
Henry was a member of various and
sundry hoards of directors, trustees,
and such aggregations of power and
respectability. A hoard of directors, it
should be remarked for the informa
tion of those who are not so familiar
with the involutions and convolutions
of high finance as we are, is a body of
men which meets once a month and
- itself a fee of a hundred dollars
per member for said meeting. Then it
goes to lunch and discourses ponder
ously on the responsibilities of wealth
and social position.
That was the kind of a game that
James Henry found himself up against
when he emerged into the full glory of
admitted manhood and began to exer
cise the free and inalienable right of
euffrage conferred upon him by the
possession of several thousand dollars'
worth of common and preferred. The
eolemn-faced. double-chinned kings of
finance who had known his father,
sometimes to their sorrow, expected
great things of James Henry, and to
be strictly truthful, he rather antici
pated great things of himself. Poor
fellow, he made the common mistake
of imagining that mere brains are in
demand at the present day. Brains can
be hired as they are needed. What the
world does need, according to the most
reliable testimony, is the appearance of
THE SAN FRANCISCO SUNDAY CALL.
intelligence; any good clerk can supply
the actual brains necessary to back up
the appearance.
But to proceed with James Henry;
when he took his seat upon the various
boards of directors which his late par
ent had erstwhile adorned with his
presence he fully expected that he
would soon become what is known as a
power in the financial world. ThiÂ« is
the name that "is r.sually given to a
man when he has reached the point
where the newspapers caricature him
regularly and campaign orators point
to him as one of the evidences of our
national decadence. James Henry ex
pected to reach this over-towering emi
nence in a few years. When a man
becomes so rich that all the people who
haven't any money to speak of con
sider him a national menace he can af
ford to sit down and rest. Up to that
time he is only one of the common herd
of millionaires.
The first time James Henry got to

he told her to pour It out. So she
got some cups and poured out enough
for all five of them and they drank
It and smacked their mouths. When
they had put down their cups she
went to the door, stepped out and
with the door about a third of the
way open she said: 'If you are goln'
to burn this house down you'd better
be about it. The fact is, I was ex
pectin' you and that coffee was fixed.
Didn't you notice how bitter it was?
It was dosed with strychnine. And
as Dr. Seymour lives at least ten miles

you can get to his house. Good night

door and ran away. Well. I never
heard such scufflin" in my life. Some
of them didn't wait to Ret out at the

"Well, they galloped all the way to

Sam in town and I asked him if he
liked coffee, and he looked at me and
said: 'Lim, you blamed fool, I'll give
you the finest game rooster in the

that affair.' I told him to send over
the bird and he did and I never men

But knowin' how much he must be at

says I, "Sam. that's the finest bird I
ever saw.' 'Yes.' he says, with an air
of pride, 'he's the finest.' 'I reckon
that's so,' says I. "And he reminds
me of one I used to own. But misfor
tune overtook him. He came into the
kitchen one day and jumped on the
table and drank some coffee and it
killed him.' 'You don't say so?' says
old Sam. with a dry grin on his face.
I told him I did say so and then re
marked that I was in something of a
hurry and must be goin'. 'Don't be
pulled,' says he. 'Oh, by the way.
don't you want this chicken?' 'Well.
as the other one you gave me has
about run out I believe I do.' So I
took the chicken and went home. We
lost a good man when old Sam died.
His Judgment of a rooster was above
reproach and was of great benefit to
me. By the way, Henry, didn't you
shoot at me one night along in sixty

"Well, now, really. Lim. I don't rec

Britt.DURING the past year the Health
Department of this city has
waged a crusade against Impure
milk and that its efforts in this
laudable direction have been
crowned with success is evidenced by
the improved quality of the milk served
to householders and greater cleanliness
in the dairies. Another year must pass
before dairymen are educated up to the
high standards required by the health
authorities and this can only be
brought about by a rigid observance
and enforcement of the milk and dairy
ordinances.
The public either through ignorance
or heedlessness, are not alive to the
danger of consuming Impure milk arid
it therefore devolves upon the health
authorities to take" all those precau
tions that will safeguard the lives of
citizens. This can only be accom
plished by energetic work. A large
corps of inspectors is needed and their
aim should be to enforce the existing
milk and dairy ordinances. They must
not be hampered In their task and
. they should be Intelligently directed by
those who have the requisite experi
ence and who have given the subject
great study and consideration.
â¢ Since his appointment as Health Of
ficer, Dr. D. F. F.agsin has given much
thought and attention to the subject
of milk. It' is due to his efforts that
the quality of milk now served in San
Francisco is cleaner a. 1 above the
butter-fat standard. He has personally
visited the dairies of this city and vi
cinity and forced the owners to ob
serve sanitary rules. It will be remem
bered that a year ago the Health Of
licer began a crusade against "filthy
milk" and his findings startled the
community, Dairies were found un
sanitary in the extreme and a disgrace
to a civilized people. The herds were
â¢ found quartered and milked in sheds
that were alive with vermin and the
men engaged in handling the milk
vere as dirty as their surroundings.
The milk was alive with bacteria be
fore It left the dairy, and by the time
it was turned over to the user it con
tained millions of colonies of bacteria
that would play havoc with the strong
est stomach.
When it is known that more than
100.000 gallons are used in this city
daily, one can appreciate the necessity
of enforcing the laws governing the
same. At least ten dairies were forced
out of business because they could not
afford to place their barns, milking
sheds, etc., in a sanitary condition.
Many of the dairymen have resorted to
the courts to frustrate the efforts of
the Health Department to comoel them
to seek other quarter* or clean up
their place*. They have secured tem
porary delays by Injunction, but event
ually will have to seek other auarters
cr have their permits to sell milk re
voked.
On â  blackboard in the rooms of the
Board of Health are names of the va
rious dairies and their rating. If the
public would arouse itself to a real
ization of its danger and would lnaulre
about the dairy that supplies it with
milk, and if shown that the source of
the supply was a "filthy dairy." with
drew its patronage, it would force the
dairymen to renewed activity In clean
ing un their dairies.
There ' are but two model dairies In
this section of the State. One is the
"S!eepy follow" dairy, located in Ma
rin County, and the other Is the Ven
dome dairy, located In Santa Clara
County. So perfect are the conditions
in both places that it is a pleasure for
the health authorities to set them uo
us shining examples of what a dairy
should b~.. The men who handle the
milk are attired in white duck and are
'supplied with clean cloths and brushes
to wipe the cow's udder before milking.
They are directed to wash their hands
immediately after grooming a cow and
before milking. The bins and stalls
are clean and the odor is not offensive.
On the contrary, everything is fresh
and sweet-smelling, and one could act- .
ually live in the barns and suffer no
discomfort. ,
It will take many years before the
dairies of this city and vicinity will
compare with the places mentioned.
This is due to the fact that dairymen
are slow to expend money in what they
deera to be useless improvements. They
argue that the general public does not
care how dirty the dairies may be so
long- as the milk is delivered at a nom
inal figure; and. If they were to make
the necessary Improvements : and then
charge a higher price tor their com
modity, the patron would immediately
become wroth and seek, a dairyman

whose prices are more moderate. Yet
the very same people would more
cheerfully expend money for liquors
than buy this value food. Next
to bread and water, milk is prob
ably more commonly used than
any other article of food or drink.
It is nutritious, economical and with
many a favorite food. It contains
in easily digestible form the four
kinds of nutrients required by the
body, namely: protein, fats, carbohy
drates and mineral matter.
Vital statistics of the Health Depart
ment show that about one-third of all
deaths are of infants, and that a very
large percentage of these die froni dis
eases of the digestive tract. These dis
eases are said to be due principally
to impure food. The impure food in
this Instance may be termed "dirty
milk," and since the Board of Health
has taken the matter in hand it can
boast that there has been a decrease in
infant mortality of at least 13*4 per
cent.
The Inspectors of the Board of Health
are not many, but the few employed by
the city are doing splendid work. They
visit the dairies daily and order the
owners to comply with the ordinances.
Constant visits are having their effect,
and where filth reigned formerly clean
liness holds sway. Samples of milk
are taken daily and brought to the lab
oratories of the Board of Health. A
portion of the sample is turned over to
Dr. Frederick G.- Carney, the city bac
teriologist, and the remainder is used
by Dr. A. C. Bothe. superintendent of
the pure food department, for analyses.
alysea.
It Is the duty of the bacteriologist
to ascertain the number of bacteria
colonies in the milk, and the result of
his examination causes the health au
thorities to admonish the dairymen to
exercise greater care in handling the
milk.
Making a bacteriological test is ex
tremely Interesting. First the sample
of milk is placed in a specially ster
ilized bottle that is wrapped in paper
so that the fingers may not contami
nate it, and also to keep out the dust.
Sterilized tubes containing a culture
media, composed of beef, broth and
peptone, to which is added agar-agar,
which is a substance made from the
inner bark of a tree grown in China,
and which has the property of liquefy
ing at a boiling heat and solidifying
when cold, is used to feed the germs
and make them grow. Before using
the germ-food, ho-wever, one hundred
centimeters of water are measured into
a sterile-flask. Then one-tenth of a
centimeter of milk is sucked up by a
glass pipette, which is not unlike a
Etraw, and dropped into the water.
This makes a proportion of one of milk
to one thousand of water and is known
as the dilution process.
Another pipette is used to suck up
one centimeter of the mixture of milk
and water, and this is dropped into a
tube of liquefied agar-agar and imme
diately plated out into a Petrie dish â a
shallow glass with a cover. This dish
is then set in an Incubator for about
thirty-six hours at a temperature of
3T>5 centigrade, which Is equivalent to
89V4 Fahrenheit. This heat, together
with the nourishing property of the
media, has a tendency to make the col
onies grow and the plate clearly shows
the bacteria, which resemble white
specks to the naked eye. This dish is
placed on a Wolfoegel tablet, which is
a glass marked off In one-fourth-inch
squares, to enable a better count of the
colonies through a powerful mlcro
scop.
Some samples show as many as 1,600,
000 colonies to the cubic centimeter.
This ie a sign of a dirty dairy. Boston
has a bacteria standard of 500,000 colo
nies to the cubic centimeter and when
ever it goes above that figure drastic
measures are taken against the dairy
supplying the milk. Unfortunately, the
Board of Supervisors have not seen fit
to enact the Board of Health's recom
mendation of an alike standard into an
ordinance, and therefore the health
authorities of this city may only ad
monish cleaner methods. It is the
presence of bacteria in milk that causes
LOUIS
LEVY
so much suffering among infants, and
it therefore behooves mothers to see to
it that their miik supply is of the best.
>Â£ow, while the bacteriologist is look
ing for germs, the chemist is busily en
gaged searching for preservalines, sol
ids, etc., and arriving at the correct
amount of butter fat in the milk. The
standard of butter fat a year ago was
J. 2. and through the efforts of the
Health Department this standard was
raised to ZA, thus insuring the best
quality of milk to householders. If the
butter fat falls below the standard the
dairynian is. arrested and he is usually
subjected to a fine by the police magis

the process followed by the pure food
laboratory in arriving at the. informa
tion desired.
When the sample is brought in its

It comes up to the standard for total
solids. Then 17.6 cubic centimeters of
milk are placed into a Babcock bottle,
mixed with an equal volume of sul

When you give liberty to people in

Is not America the landâ the great
land of liberty? Does not America
want to give liberty to all classes of
people irrespective of sex or color or
creed? Does she not want to give lib
erty to man and woman both equally
in every affair?
Why is not a woman allowed to give
votes for political officers? Why does
not an American woman aspire to be
even the President of her country?
The ideas of liberty will- then be
complete when we can mean to give it
to both man and woman to the same

is added to bring the total solution to

and the butter fat rises to the surface:

subjected to another test that Is known
as the Soxhlet process. Ten grams of

over to the driver, who turns it over
to his employer. This permits the
owner to have the milk examined by a
private chemist in the hope of dis
proving the anaylsis of the Health De

Return of the Popular Sun Shade
* * I - for a time,- languidly sigrhs
7 the maid of to-day and
*"â¢ straightway the shops brins
out a gx>wn of lilac colored
taffeta with girdle yoke and vest of
â¢weam taffeta embroidered In lilacs.
â¢Around the foot there is very apt to
be a flounce, with embroidered lilacs
at the head. And with this they fetch
a hat trimmed In tiny bunches. Nor
do they stop in their mad career here
either, for verily, verily this is the
year of extravagance. With this fine
array come two parasols, one a beau
tiful lilac colored one and the other
a cream sunshade with lilacs lavishly
â Worked upon it. For be it known to
the uninitiated, this is the year of
lilacs and of parasols.
Ttje woman who has Just discovered
the beauties that play hide and seek
in the sunshade vows to possess them
from now to doomsday. Whether
she will remains to be seen, but cer
tainly they are here for a season and
here in a wealth of beauty and glerry,
100.
Years ago the fluffy fluff fluff was
the heart's desire of every one, but
this year shows a great and astonish
ing absence of frills. But this does
not necessarily mean that they are
lacking when it comes to furbelows,
for they are embroidered and trimmed
in many ways, only there is less ruf
fling and there are by far fewer
flounces about the edges. In fact,
there is a tendency toward the plain
parasol and a liking for the one that
is plain, except for its embroidered
panels.
t of the most strikingly elegant
sunshades of the season â it is called
a sunshade in the English shops, by
the wayâ ip made t.-f wnite linen em
broidered in the English eyelet em
broidery. The openwork extends all
around the outer edge of the parasol,
and is worked In white. To say the
Jeast, it is very handsome, very showy
and very becoming, though to be sure
it is not as dressy as its satin sister,
though it is far more appropriate with
linen gowns and is decidedly chic when
â¢worn with an embroidered frock.
There are parasols and parasols this
season until the different kinds fairly
make ones head whirl. But the most
popular are those made of satin, of
taffeta, of pongee, of heavy openwork
linen and of handsomely figured silk.
Th're are pompadour silk parasols,
and there are delightful sprigged nov
elties, of a truth, there is everything
and anything, and clever indeed is the
woman who can calmly and coolly pass
them by, for they fairly beg you to
buy them, because they are so pretty
and cost so little.
To be sure, there are parasols that
run well up into the fancy figures, but
the price is not exorbitant when you
stop long enough to examine the beau
tiful handles; nor is it excessive when
you consider the quality of the fabric
end the quantity of hand work. But
re matter how lovely it may all be
*40 or more is dear when you have a
limited purse and are trying to make a
few dollars spread out over the entire
wardrobe.
But be comforted and very speedily
at that, for there are paraÂ«ols to match
all pocket-books, and if you 'possess
the least spark of taste, a cheap one
will not look like ten centa, though in
reality it may not cost many more
pennies.
If you are setting out to buy a sun
shade, be sure you buy right. And
this is no very- easy thing to do, for
there is such a variety offered that you
can very readily go < ompletely wrong
and have a relic of bygones instead of
the newest of the new. In the first
place remember that there are several
things missing in the fashionaDie para
6o) world. There are very few lace
edgings, very little lace flc-unclng, and
the iLeep handsome lace covers and
lace ruffles which were such a vogue
a few seasons ago are not to be found.
In their place are parasols abundantly
trimmed on top and on the paneis, but
there is little or no lace, or trimming
for that matter, to hang over the edge.
As a rtarter in the right direction
you should form some sort of an idea
In your mind as to the suit with which
you are to carry it. Not that they are
to match explicitly, for they most de
cidedly are not, but just because you
are given so much leeway does Hot
mean that it Is your bounden duty to
combine colors that will clash and
fight to a fl:
And. by the way. v hen making your
selection try to choose the right kind
of a handle. Ye gods' V.'hat a time
you will have before you are entirely
satisfied and pleased. Silver, copper
enamel and gun metal are all very
fashionable, while Jvory, both light
and dark, atid pearls, clear and
smoked, .-ire excellent. Then there is
the gun metal set with turqucise or
the copper v.ith rubies in one corner,
again, the dull silver, made beau
tiful with enameled firures.
All these are extremely fetching and
fit, but the woman who is anxious to
be right up to the season will hie
herself to the counter where the
wooden heads are Eold and rhe will
select a psrnsol with the head of a
bulldog upon the handle. The head
will be big and beautifully carved and
It v,UI look almost like life. In fact
Queer as it may seem, most of these
heads are as big p_s apples and are
done in dark woods to contrast sharp
ly with the light, daintily colored
parasols.
The animals' headsâ jungle heafls,
they are called â were never as nume
rous. The monkey climbing a pole Is
seen and the sjephant solemnly walk
ing a narrow bridge all mounted upon
the end of*a very long stick, which
serves as the handle.
Besides this there are horses' heads
and cats with arched backs and dogs
as big as your clinched hand. To be
honest, you simply can't have your
"Jungle head" too big and you can't
have him too showy.
It takes all sorts and conditions of
people to make a world and for this
reason It takes all sorts and conditions
of handles to please. The woman who
likes sporty looking ornaments now
and then tires of them and longs for
a change and her meeker, more re
tiring sister wouldn't wear one for
love or money.
So by way of variety the alpenstock
is here and right smart it is too, with
its extra long handle and Parisian
rosettes about the hand instead of the
dangling tassels that were formerly
so much used. Sometimes it is cu
riously crooked, or quaintly designed,
while many of them are straight and
long showing an expanse of etching
that is as dainty and lovely as can be.
And one more thing I would call your
attention to. Look at the shape and
finish of the sunshade before you
make it your very own. Many of them
possess an additional rib, which while
it seems small in itself, makes all the
difference in the world. Instead of
being ordinarily curved, it is prettily
arched and is just twice as smart ap
pearing as its more unfortunate next
door neighbor.
"It is the finishing touches that add
the final bit of style and that really
make or mar the article," says Mr.
Moran, one of the big wholesalers in
town.
"For Instance, the frame that ends
in tiny ivory tips is ever bo much
more swagger than the one with In
significant little black wires. And.
really, the difference In price is not so
appalling, either." The automobile or
the coach parasol fashioned of greens,
brown*, blues and pongee, in a be
wildering array of tucked effects is
certainly *he proper caper for town
wear, but there is no gainsaying the
fact that the lovely hand-painted chif
fons, trimmed with billows and billows
i/f ruffk-5, are by far the prettiest
thing that can be fashioned for fluffy
summer gowns.
There Is a wonderful fad for flower
effects and her ladyship will be a pic
ture woman â resemb%ng in every par
ticular a delicately colored, scented
flower.
Her gown will be sprigged and
flowered and embroidered in vines and
blossoms ant! her hat will be a sort
of flower garden, a miniature garden,
to be sure, but one upon which the
roses climb in trellis fashion.
With such a costume the fluff and
feather reem absolutely essential and
no matter if Dame Fashion has set
her foot down and said "no ruffles."
ruffles ..here will be for the few who
are brave enough to defy her decree
and be amazingly pretty as a conse
quence.
The girl who is somewhat afraid of
this stand can do the next best thing
and buy a lined parasol, which, I am
sorry to say, Is a little bit scarce,
though it is seen now and then!
and frequently lined with a contrast
ing color. Sometimes, it even hap
pens that there is a deal of hand em
broidery Inside a sunshade and this
makes It doubly pretty and likewise
doubly expensive.
But whether they are lacy and
frilly or whether they are plain und
elegant, parasols there must be. That
much Is certain and there isn't uny
getting around it. So don your moat
fetching: frock and your most becom
ing hat and start right out, for no
Easter costume will be complete with
out it. And, by the way, let me add.
be chic in buying your sunshade. No
matter whnt you get or do, or what
you cannot get or do. be chic!

FORMING A BEAUTIFUL NECK
(Marie). â To desire a well-rounded neck
is not mere vanity, but a worthy ob
ject worthy of special effort. No sensi
ble woman shc-uld sit down and let the
unlovely lines creep in about the
throat when a half hour each day
spent in exercise will ward off the
marks of time for many years. If
careless as to how th nead is poised,
correct the fault at once. A graceful
carriage will bring nil the pretty lines
in play while an awkward poise of the
head will often force a double chin in
evidence which would never be ob
served, or but slightly, if the chin had
been held up instead of being allowed
to drop low with the muscles relaxed.
Whenever possible discard high and
stiff collars, which are the most fruit
ful source of withered and discolored
necks; the pressure and continual fric
tion destroys the texture of the skin
and causes the muscles to become flab
by. It is a notable fact that women
who habitually dress the neck very low
retain the fine contour of the neck until
late in life. Practice the following ex
ercises before a mirror with the neck
muscles relaxed, and repeat each move
ment ten times. Relax the throat mus
cles, clasp the hands toacK of the neck
and roll the head around In a pivotal
manner. Let the head go backward as
far as possible, raise and repeat, then
allow it to fall forward until the chin
touches the breast, raise and repeat,
doing the exercise slowly to avoid mus
cular strain. Next, let the head fall
slowly to the right, raise and repeat.
then go through the same movement to
the left. Repeat this exercise fifteen
times.
EDWARINE (Corset*).â lt Is very,
very discouraging trying to develop
the bust, but it can be done many
times if one persists at it. In the
first place cold water will help you
very much. Every morning dash cold
water on your chest many times and
then rub yourself vigorously to make
the blood circulate freely. At night
take a good skin food and rub it in
well, but be careful how you do it,
because the breasts are very sensitive
and you are very apt to do far more
harm than good. Always rub round
and toward the center and rub gently.
Massage is very good, but I would not
advise you to try it, for the simple
reason that I am afraid of it unless
one knows something of it.
2. There is no corset that will aid
your purpose very much, though there
are a few that will make you look
larger and give you a better shape.
For this answer, addresses, I mean,
you will have to send me your name
and address. In the mean time why
don't you make a series of three ruf
fles, cambric edged with lace, and wear
them under your corse, -over? They
will help your figure materially and
are cool and clean and light in weight
at the same time.
3. Bread, potatoes, milk, cream and
sweets all help to increase flesh, but
much meat must be left alone. Deep
breathing exercises are good for this,
too, as the blood bounds into every
corner and gives new life and energy.
DUTIES OF A GUEST (-Unsophisti
cated"). â When being entertained al
ways remember that your first duty Is
to your hostess. A guest should not
expect to be provided with continual
amusement or seem to depend wholly
upon the guidance of others; neither
must she seek to introduce innovations
of any kind, as they may be displeas
ing simply because they run counter to
plans already under way. A guest
must not make appointments or ask
friends to call upon her until she has
first consulted her hostess and gained
her approval: this courtesy should
never be neglected, for a hostess has a
perfect right to know who is coming
into her house and interpose a polite
objection without any one feeling of
fended, if she sees fit to do so. Her
objection does not necessarily reflect
against your friends, but may be based
entirely upon personal convenience,
which she is not expected to explain. If
your friends call be very particular
to introduce them to- your hostess and
members of her family. An inconsid
erate guest who takes advantage of his
or her position as guest to impose
nameless little selfish and thoughtless
acts. Is the greatest trial with which
a hostess has to contend, hence it is
not strange that some people find the
doors of their erstwhile friends closed
against them. Tact and close observa
tion will teach one "the happy medium
and how to be a pleasant instead of a
burdensome guest.
HINTS FOR THE COUNTRY
HOUSE (Mrs. M.).â The up-to-date
housekeper in quest of something new
for the country house will surely be in
terested in the latest chamber conven
ience, known as the "good-night" sets,
which come in almost every color. The
set consists of a candlestick, tumbler,
ice pitcher and a match box. all fitted
into a circular tray. To the jaded
nerves, weary of close surroundings,
chambers fresh and dainty with dra
peries of flowered cretonne and (ilmy
curtains of dotted swlss. soft green
wicker or woven grass furniture and
the spotless bed of enameled metal are
Joys. If possible, arrange to have win
dow boxes attached to the chamber
windows and fill them with gay gera
niums, mignonette and heliotrope, and
don't forget a rose geranium. THe?e
flower boxes will make the stay in the
country even more enjoyable than
usual and afford a charming contrast
to the dust and roar of the city, which
is well worth the time spent in keep
ing the flower boxes in order. For the
living room Mission furniture is given
the preference. Strong colors such as
subdued green and red, are most har
monious for the massive outlines of the
furniture. All light bric-a-brac, pic
tures painted in water colors and every
thing of this order should be tabooed.
Posters in dull black frames. Venetian
iron and rich, dark pottery are most
charming, and dark rugs over a pol
ished floor the most satisfactory cov
ering.
COLORING SOUPS. BERNAISE
SAUCE (Mrs. V. D.)â Variation in the
coloring of soups is had by the admix
ture of a er??all quantity of highly col
ored vegetable or prepared paste.
Grated carrot is used for amber soup,
a few leaves of spinach imparts a deli
cate green, tomatoes shades of red, ac
cording to quantity used, burnt sugar
or browned fl:>ur a creamy choco-late
color, and a pinch of curry powder a
rich golden yellow. The spinach should
be washed and steamed In just enough
water to extract the Juice and prevent
burning. Strain the Juice and add to
the soup just before serving. This is
particularly desirable in coloring mock
turtle, celery, potato or onion soups.
Crotens or bread sticks are usually
served with all soups except oyater
soup and the heavy creamy sorts.
To make Bernaiae sauce simmer to
gether one gill each of white wine and
tarragon vinegars, one small white
onion chopped fine, one teaspoonful of
peppercorns and a dash of cayenne;
simmer until the liquid is reduced onÂ«
half. Set aside to cool for several min
utes, then stir in the slightly beaten
yolks of two fresh eggs. Set the sauce
pan in a basin of boiling water, add
slowly two tablespoonfuls cf soft but
ter, stirring constantly. When thÂ«
mixture begins to thicken draw to the
back of the stove and stir until smooth
and creamy; if cooked too rapidly the
sauce will be thin and stringy. Strain
into a warm srravy boat and serve.
Whenever obtainable get the fresh tar
ragon, chop fine and add one teaspoon
ful to the mixture before simmering.
As the fresh herb is scarce even in city
markets, housekeepers are forced to
depend largely upon tarragon vinegar.
TREATING MOTH PATCHES (Vie
lette).âFrom the description given of
your trouble I think you are suffering
from a torpid liver and defective cir
culation, and both internal and ex
ternal remedies are needful to effect
relief. The brown spots or moth
patches are indications of sluggish cir
culation in the capillaries of the skin,
which has caused the deposit of col
oring matter to settle in spots in the
layers of the epidermis. To dislodge
these disfiguring patches will require
time and persistent effort, but I think
it can be done and your health greatly
improved as well. Begin the internal
treatment by drinking at least a half
pint of hut water every morning before
breakfast. Get some dandelion liver
pills and take one in the morning and
another before retiring to relieve the
liver and the blood of the accumulated
impurities. Continue the use of these
pills for. at least six months, taking
only one each day after the first three
months. Twice each day. preferably
morning and evening, massage over
the stomach and abdomen to excite
more rariid circulation and incidentally
it will assist all the Internal organs to
perform their several functions with
greater regularity. The movement
should be rota^. followed by gentle
kneading and the massage should be
continued for at least twenty minutes.
Be very careful of your diet, avoiding
all foods which are liable to cause bii
iary disorders arising from a derange
ment of the liver. To assist in dis
lodging the patches on the face more
activity is needed here. Facial mas.
sage once each day will prove very
beneficial if accompanied with just
enough cold cream to prevent irritat
ing the skin, after which you may ap
ply a bleach to fade out the patches.
This treatment may not entirely eradi
cate the discoloration, as It Is of such
long standing, still it will greatly im
prove- things. Prepare as follows and
apply with a brush of camel's hair:
Take two ounces of witch hazel, two
ounces orange flower water and ten
grains of the coarse powder of cor
rosive sublimate and mix thoroughly.
This lotion is a mineral poison and
should be labeled and kept under lock
and key to prevent accidents to chil
dren.
CLARA B. (Firm Cheeks).â You

sess all the woes you say you do and

never mind, you really are not as bad
ly off as you think you are. If those
marks are j jllow and of fair size use:
Oleate of copper 15 grains
Ointment of oxide of zinc. . % oz.
Rub into the spots morning and night.
If, on the other hand, your entire
face needs a bleach, use:
Bichloride of mercury in coarse
powder 10 grains
Distilled water. . 1 pint
Agitate the two together until a
strong solution is obtained. Then add
one-half ounce of glycerine. Apply
with a sponge as often as agreeable.
This is not strong enough to blister
and skin the face in average cases.
It may be increased or reduced in
strength by adding or taking from the
amount of bichloride of mercury. And
be sure to remember that mercury is
a powerful poison and should be kept
out of reach of children, in fact, away
from all persons.
2. Now about the alcohol. I cer
tainly would not use too much of it.
for the reason that it is veflr drying
and it will do you very little good. In
its place use an astringent water.
Get eight lUllll â Â«>f orange flower
water and one-fourth drarhm of sim
ple tincture of benzoin. Drop the ben
zoin a little at a time into the orHnff-?
llower water. Shake the bottle. The
result will be a milky liquid. Dip
a linen cloth into a little of this liquid
and bathe the face, if it feels drawn
add a little more orange flower water.
Tincture of benzoin varies somewhat
In strength. It should not feel uncom
fortable upon the face. When it does,
ami pulls the skin. It is too powerful.
By tho way. it Ju?t umirti< to me
that there is a simple wash for a
blotched skin that might be of value
to you. It consists of one ounce of
glycerine, half an ounce of rosemary
water and twenty drops of carbolic
acid. Many times this is very effect
ual.
3. There are certain ways to nib the
face and if you depart from these you
are certainly doing yourself more
harm than good. Go to some woman
and have a face massage and watch
and see just how she does it. An ob
ject lesson will help you far more than
any advice I might give you. There
are plenty of pure creams turned out
all the time and if you will send me
your name and address I will give you
the names of them.

LONDON. April -1. â Lord Curzon,
who. as everybody in America knows,
married the elder Miss Leiter, ha* been
putting his foot in it since he returned
to India. He has been lecturing the
natives, on their lack of veracity and
general disregard of the command

show of righteous indignation, and.
availing themselves of the license al

thingE they declared that he is "an

can't very well accept presents with
out giving something in exchange. By
announcing that he will accept no pres
ents he escapes the burden of having
to make any.
When King Edward, as Prince of
Wales, made his memorable visit to
India, he brought back with him a
shipload of gifts worth something like
1L269.000. And Parliament was re
quired tv vote $300,000 to help him pay
for the things he had given away.
There would be a lot of objecting in
Parliament and some nasty things
would be said if it were asked to re
peat that performance. And it is doubt
ful if such a grant could be carried
through again.
The most costly of the gifts received
on that occasion came from independ
ent native Princes. It was a much
easier matter for them to raise money
in those days than it is now. They
levied tribute pretty much as they
pleased and their subjects were com
pelled to pay. Since then British in
fluence has placed considerable restric
tions on the tax-levying powers of the
rajahs. So take it all round, the no

ingly wise one. Of course, it was the
King who put the Prince up to It.

The Prince met Mme. de Beauclere

Regard for Bavarian Princess
Stirs Jealousy of Fiancee.
BERLIN, April I.â Pretty Duchess
Cecilie of Mecklenburg-Schwerin was
not selected as a suitable wife for the
German Crown Prince until many
other candidates for this exalted posi
tion had been passed in review and re
jected by Ac German Emperor and his
advisers. It was no easy matter to find
a Princess who combined all the quali
ties for a German Empress. It was felt
that the German Crown Prince must
have a wife who is robust and healthy,
so that she will perpetuate a sturdy
and vigorous Hohenzollern stock. It
was also felt that the future Empress
must be in possession of a large private
fortune, because the German Crown
Prince will not inherit much money
from his father.
Although the German Emperor's offi
cial revenues are ample for his require
ments, and although his private means
are considerable, they cannot be com
pared with those of the Emperors of
Austria and Russia. The Kaiser is
poorer than he was at the beginning of
his reign, because he has invariably
spent the whole of his income and a
little more besides. It is an open secret
that the German Emperor has raised
loans on various occasions, so that it
can be well understood that the family
finances are not in the most prosperous
condition. The Crown Prime will suf
fer financially from the fact that he
has five younger brothers and one sis
ter, all of whom must be provided for
by the Emperor out of his own private
means.
All of these circumstances combine to
make it essential that the wife of the
German Crown Prince should be a
Princess possessing a large private for
tune. In addition to the requirements
of health and wealth it was necessary
that the selected candidate should be a
Protestant, and it was, of course, es
sential that she should be young.
CONSUMPTION IN FAMILY.
Although Duchess Cecilie of Meek-
Special Cable to The Call.
lenburg-Schwerin was finally selected
as the best of all the possible candi
dates, the German Emperor and his
advisers have not shut their eyes to
the fact that she does not possess all
the qualities which they considered es
sential to the position. It is true that
she will fullfll their expectations in re
gard to financial matters, because her
grandfather, the Grand Duke Michael
Xicholaivitch of Russia, has promised
to make her his heiress, and he is a
man of fabulous wealth. The Grand
Duke will present his granddaughter
with a substantial dowry on the day of
her wedding so that she will brine her
husband a big fortune combined with
the centainty of a colossal legacy at
a date which cannot be postponed much
longer, for Grand Duke Michael
Nicholaivitch is already seventy-three
years of age.
Duchess Cecilie is also a Protestant.
but here her qualifications end. Al
though she herself appears to be a
healthy girl and although she lives a
rational life largely devoted to outdoor
sport and exercise, she conies of a
stock which is so unhealthy that the
gravest fears must h*Â» entertained for
the future of the Hohenzollern dynasty.
Her father was consumptive, and for
many years of his life was in such
delicate health that he was obliged to
spend the greater part of the year in
enforced exile in the Riviera or in the
mild cliniite of Italy and Sicily.
HIS son. the reigning Grand Duke of
M --klenburar-Schwerin. who is Duchess
Cecilie's brother, appears to have in
herited the terrible disease. The Grand
Duke, with his pale emaciated features
and sunken cheeks, has the appearance
of a man doomed to consumptive de
cline into an early grave.
KKPORT OF A SCANDAL.
; Another grave objection to the choice
of 'Diichess Cecilie as the wife of the
German Crown Prince; was the embar
rassing .affair.; in which her! mother.
Grand DuchessT Ana'stasla, . was involved
early in 1903. A statement was pub
lished in the newspaper press of nearly
every European country that Grand
Duchess Anastasia of Mecklenburg-
Schwerin had eloped with a young bar
ber who had been an assistant in A
hairdresser's shop at Schwerin.
The young barber in question, it was
said, had been frequently summoned to
the grand ducal palace at Schwerin la
dress the hair of the Grand Duchess
Anastasia. who had become enamored
of him. When the Grand Duchess start
ed on her annual journey southward to
spend the winter at Cannes the youn*
barber disappeared from his shop, and
was noticed a few days later at Cannes,
where he continued to attend the Grand
Duchess. The young Grand Duke
of Meeklenburg-Schwerin arrived at
Cannes a few days later, drove the
young barber away in order to put an
end to the malicious comments of gos-
siping tongues, and a formal denial
was given to the whole story of the
elopement.
It has become an open secret in G*r
man court and social circles that
Duchess Cecilie has inherited her moth
er's extremely jealous disposition,
which often proved troublesome during
his lifetime to the late Grand Duke of
Meeklenburg-Schwerin.
DUCHESS BECOMES JEALOUS
The Crown Prince was the guest wt
the Bavarian royal family, which in
cludes many youni; and fascinating
Princesses. The Crown Prince went
out hunting with the young Bavarian
royal ladies, many of whom are good
shots and enthusiastic sportswomen,
and. of course, rumors of the pleasant
way in which he was spending his time
were speedily brought to Duchess Ce
cilie's ears. In the course of the visit *
a number of photographs showing the
Crown Prince in the company uf the
Bavarian Princesses were taken and
these caused trcruble.
In every one of the photographs the
Crown Prince was shown standing or
sitting next to Princess Rupprecht of
Bavaria, whose husband will, in the
natural course of events, one day as
cend the Bavarian throne. Princess
Rupprecht is a most fascinating young
lady and it is well known that she
does not live on the happiest terms
with her husband, so that her close as
sociation with the Crown Prince dur
ing his visit to Bavaria was much no
ticed and many false conclusions were
drawn.
One of the photographs showed the
Crown Prince arm in arm with Prin
cess Rupprecht, while others showed
him sitting next to her in various at
titudes more or less tender and af
fectionate. The photographs were per
fectly harmless and there was nothing
in them to suggest that the Cn>~::
Prince hail forgotten nts duty \Â» *iÂ»
fiancee, but Duchess Cecilies jealous**
disposition led to trouble, so that for
j a time the course uf true lorÂ» r*n <*Â«r
from smoothly.
The Crown Prince has now gonÂ«
south to spend the rest of the winter
with Duchess Cecilie in Italy, and It
has been openly stated by German
newspapers that the true reason for
his departure is the fact that the Duch
â¢t ilie objected to his attending the
great court balls and functions which
take place in Berlin during the spring,
fearing that in her absence he would
flirt with the young Princesses and
ladies of the German aristocracy who
are present on such occasions.
Some discontent has been causÂ«d in
Germany by two circumstances con
nected with the approaching marrlaga
of the German Crown Prince. Duch
ese, Cecilie's trousseau has been or
dered principally in London. Parts
-,nd Vienna and only a very small pro
portion of the orders for the articles
.)f clothing required have been given
to German firms.18

Father and Sons.
Mitchell J. Myers, an old-time resi
dent of San Francisco, for many years
a member of the National Guard of thu>
city, known to all old guardsmen as
"Corporal Alvera." has been for thirty
E. C. STOCK
years the tyler of Fidelity Lodge, Freb
and Accepted Masons. During that pe
riod he has been a most faithful at
tendant at the portal of the lodgeroom,
never being absent on a lodge night ex
cept for one period when a severe at
tack of illness confined him to his
home for several weeks. The tyler of
Fidelity has on many occasions been
offered advancement in the lodge, but
he has always declined, preferring the
position he has filled so long, faithfully,
honestly and conscientiously to the
highest one the lodge could bestow
upon him. He is credited with hav
ing never permitted any one to
cross the threshold of the lodgeroom
unless he gave the proof that is re
quired for admission. He insists in the
most positive manner in securing from
his sons, and there are five of them in
the lodge, that which is required to
make themselves known according to
the usage of the fraternity. A remark
able fact in connection with Tyler
Myers" incumbency is his most remark
able memory for names and faces. He
not only knows every member of the
lodge, and it has a large membership,
but can call them by name even though
they may absent themselves from the
lodge for a long time; not only this, but
when he once hears the name and ob
serves the face of a visitor he can name
him and the lodge he belongs to, even
though the visitor come but once in a
great while. Upon his silver anniver
sary as tyler, the lodge, recognizing his
faithful service for a quarter of a cen
tury in preventing intrusion into the
hall, gave him a valuable go^ld watch
and chain. In addition to the remark
able position Tyler Myers holds in the
lodge, he has the distinction of being
the only Mason in the United States, so
it is asserted by those who have inves
tigated, of having five sons as menv
bers of the lodge in which he holds his
membership. These are George H.,
who was raised a Master Mason Feb
ruary 16, 1893; Isador B. and Louis,
raised June la, TJO2; Robert, raised Oc
tober 22, 1903, and Joseph, raised May
26, 1904. He has two more sons, who,
as soon as they attain the age when
they may take the apprentice degree,
will become members of Fidelity Lodge.
In the picture of this family of Masons,
Tyler Myers occupies the central posi
tion, George H. is to his right hand and
Louis to his left in the front row, Jo
seph stands behind his brother George,
Robert behind his father and Isador be
hind his brother Louis. The tyler prays
that he may be permitted to live and
be the guardian of the lodge entrance
until his two other sons shall become
Master Masons.

Signor Caruso Is the chief con
cession of Herr Conried this season to
the "vicious" star system. Whisper
it not in Gath â we don't want Peta
luma and New York to know, but
this week is not the first chance we
have had to hear Signor Caruso.
GREAT SINGER WHO IS COMING TO SAN FRANCISCO WITH THE CONRIED COMPANY AND WHO WILL INTERCHANGE WITH MME. NORDICA IN ROLE OF KUNDRY.
We are not particularly proud of it.
In fact. Mr. or "Doc." Leahy is tell
ing rather ruefully these days that
he could have had Caruso eight years^
ago for the Tivoli at $150 a week! But
let us not think too hardly of Mr.
Leahy. His own Italy at the same
time hissed Caruso off the stage. Of
the other forgotten tenor that was
chosen for the Tivoli history hath not
kept record.
As to Caruso, we will hope that he
does not know what he missed. Ac
cording to report, that first of all
sets him down as a "royal good fel
low," the tenor is not of the gloating
kind. If he were, the sweetest of re
venge awaits him in this week's tri
umph. There can be no possible
shadow of a doubt that he is the
most wonderfully voiced of known
tenors. The impression he creates
everywhere, on critics and populace
alike, is too profound, too unique, to
spell anything but an absolute sov
ereignty. It is not to the throne of
Jean de Reszke that Caruso suc
ceeds, for his metier is purely Italian
opera. Rather, say those with long
enough memories, the elnger is the
direct successor of Mario.
Which reminds. Of the interesting
gossip of which the air is full none
is more piquantly charming than that
with an Individuality wholly the artist's
own. A little poem, this!
Another Montereyan's work that
stands out is Evelyn McCormick's. And
It stands wholly by itself, in that it is
gay and glad in its tone, radiating a
feeling of joyousness and warmth in
every stroke of the brush â wholly flout
ing the old-time cry that worthy work
of high tone is not looked upon with
favor by the high priests of the insti
tute. Of Miss McCormick's pictures I
personally prefer "The Old Theater,"
hung high upon the east wall. This is
a charming little bit.
Wiilic Davis shows a prolific brush,
exhibiting several small canvases and
one large picture of the Sierras â a
thing that challenges a moving eye.
It is apparent from the treatment
that Mr. Davis knows his Sierras rath
er thoroughly, with their abrupt gorges,
rugged and pine-clad, their trees en
wrapt in the hazes of the heights. In
this picture a bluish light has fallen
over the canyonâ a light that strikes
me just a trifle too blue. But there are
strange atmospheric conditions up in
the Sierras, and it is not an improb
able thing that Mr. Davis has seen just
that sorf of haze. If so, he did the
right thing to paint it that way. Near
this big canvas is a delicious bit of a
spring landscapeâ a little sonnet to the
glad things of nature.

of Mr. C. H. Meltser, critic, play
wright â Mansfield owes to him his
favorite play of "Rodeo, the Student"
â and litterateur generally, and for
the nonce of the Conried suite. I had
half an hour with him the other
morning, part of it spent in gathering
the critic's impressions of Caruso. A
delightfully graceful and fluent gos
sip, Mr. Meltzer confessed himself
quite helpless to give any adequate
impression of the Caruso organ. That
it pours out like Patti's, that in
"L'Elisir d'Amore" it is like a human
, nightingale's, that it is absolutely
I sweet, absolutely round, absolutely
| pure,_ absolutely flexible, so much I
j gathered. The "singer, too, as the
i critic put It, was "taught mostly of
God."
It â was here that Mario's name
was mentioned. Mr. Meltzer would
be likely to mention it, for it is part
of an unforgettable experience. Bald
ly, the experience was this: Happen
ing to be in Rome at the time of
Mario's death, Mr. Meltzer went to
follow the one-time idol to his grave.
A pitifully few stragglers accompanied
the modest cortege to a little church
on the bank of the Tiber. Here a
scant service was held, and then,
one by one, the mourners crept away,
until the poor remains of him who
had thrilled the heart of all Europe
were left alone â alone but for an
American newspaper man. And by
the famous dead the American
watched in the gloom until Prince
Odeschalchl came, and he, one other
friend, and the American newspaper
man were the only people that saw
Mario laid in his grave.
Mr. Conried has been generous with
his "Caruso nights" here. Six times
the tenor will be heard, on the open
ing night in "Rigoletto," at the Sat
urday matinee and on the Friday fol
lowing in "Pagliacci." Mr. Meltzer
proclaims his Canio an "unforgettable
thrill." On Monday evening in "Lu
cia." and on Wednesday and the final
Saturday evening in "La Gioconda."
Among the beauties of the season one
must not forget the ballets, and in par
ticular the ballet the "Dance of the
Hours" in "La Glaconda." It is the
usual symbolic dance, the triumph of
light over darkness, and is said to be
enchantingly beautiful as presented by
the Conried ballerinas.
It is not uninteresting to know that
Mr. Conried believes he is giving, us a
good deal in giving twelve perform
ances. Boston, Philadelphia and Chi
cago had only one week apiece. This
is the way it came about aB Mr. Strine
tells it:
When the opera season was first
planned for San Francisco Mr. Strine

particularly fascinating study, worked

masters. But why glaze so heavily, Mr.
Greenbaum?
Miss Withrow's portrait of Walter
Crane.^he English artist, fs a wonder
ful likeness, not, however, so dramatic
as her portraits of women.
Ada Romer Shawhan's "Moments
Muslcaf*' is a strong bit of character
study, quite up to the conscientious
work being done by this clever little
woman.
Sandona's best work is No. 265 â a de
licious bit of mother love and baby
confidence, backed by a glad green
meadow. This is as sweet and pure a
thing as has graced the gallery in
many moons â and it shows work, earn
est work. Sandona's pictures this year
show more purpose, more study, more
definiteness than before, and, conse
quently, less of faddism. Progressing
on these lines, this interesting young
fellow has a big career ahead of himâ
if he works.

:}â ': By all means seek out Theodore
Wores* "Scene in the Alhambra," with
its { splendid court, a-glitter with ' i the

ment of one -week. He claimed that the
city of the Golden Gate had paid more
money than any city of the world of
its size â aye, or of twice its size â to see
the greatest of grand opera organiza
tions beforetimes, and that one week
was not enough.
Said Mr. Conried in reply: "I. only
gave Boston one week, Philadelphia
one week and Chicago one week. Why
should I give a city of leas than one
half their size twice as much opera?"
"Well," said Mr. Strine, "they will
give you twice as much money and
greet you with twice as much enthu
siasm. The records will show, and San
Francisco will not be satisfied with one
week."
Mr. Conried's final decision in the
Blanche
Partington
matter is the best proof that Mr.
Strine's insistence had its reward, but
the impresario of the Metropolitan
Opera-house said laconically when he
agreed to give* San Francisco a season
of twelve performances: "Now it is up
to you and your wonderful public to
justify me in this matter." Mr. Strine
said the results would justify any and
all claim made in the name of San
Francisco, and when I last saw him it
looked that way. There was not much
of Mr. Strine's eyes to be seen after the
two nights and days he had been up
with Mr. Campbell filling out mail or
ders, but that much looked enftrely
satisfied.

IS BRIDGE

Forsooth, is bridge the thing, new

engeance it's a sex individuality, and
why deny it" And herein lies the em
r bridgeâ not in its use but in its
buse.
Among the noted bridge players in j
an Francisco are some of the brain- ;
st women in the â and some of the- j
lliest- But to the former type their j
game is but an incident of a busy day, i
what with social duties, philanthropies Â«
' "and domestic obligations. But to the j
'. latter class, their bridge is the whole j
â¢ Jay. it* morn, its noon, its night; and ;
" the big things of life â the baby's call, !
â¢ husband's yearn for companionship, ;
the obligations to the home and its lov- j
ing ones all are forgot in the mad, i
feverish warfare over the bits of paste
board. Eagerness and sharp retort and ,
"flushed faces" characterize these j
games, and it is the prize that is be
ing played â not the incidental
pleasure of the game. This is the sin
of bridge. It is gambling, pure and
simple, whether the prize be cash or
merchandise â by the way. it's not
an unheard of thing to exchange unde
sirable merchandise for cash. But this
is a secret, and don't you tell it, 'pon
honor.
A story is going the rounds of a New
York woman, now visiting in Washing- ;
ton, who was known to be a bridge fa- i
. natio. Consequently she was promptly
invited to Join a motley lot of bridge
coteries in the capital, where the fever
has reached the virulent stage. Her
. declination to join was the cause of
much comment and no little ill-feeling.

that her husband had closed a contract
with her to pay her $10,000 if she re
. framed from playing bridge for a year
âand the was trying a mighty big try
; to do it.
"Now, while this particular husband
was a model of generosity, he was nev

pretty near that much for a woman of
. the smart set to keep up with her
gowni, her suppers, her losses and the
. loss of her "nerves," with the neces
Â» eary trip abroad to pull them together
again. For sane women â are
mostly sane on bridge; it's., poker
they're weak on â the game Is as legiti
mate, and infinitely more entertaining,
than knitting, and not a whit more sin
ful. . .
What think you of the plan pursued
. by some of the big Chicago clubs where
bridge has hit hardâ the taxing of the.
members, the captured money, to go to
certain prescribed charities? Here zest:
is added to the game, by the clink of
coin, the money is fairly won, the re
ward enjoyed, and then the "kitty" is
turned over to tome charity. And thus
is pleasure sated and cupidity thwart

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL. SUNDAY, AFRIT. 2. 1905
THREE YOUNG MATRONS, ONE A RECENT BRIDE ANOTHER A VISITOR
FROM THE SOUTH, THE POSSESSOR OF AN EXQUISITE VOICE AND
THE THIRD A VOYAGER FROM BUNNY' HAWAII.
#
Donahue, Royden Williamson, .Otto
Fleishman, Mr. Hensen, Mr. Owens,
Harry Mestayer.
After much speculating and much
anticipating, Mr. and Mrs. Harry Mac
farlane are once more San Francis
cans. And a merry month awaits
them, for "Polly Dunn" has friends by
the score who are waiting for her to
catch her breath after traveling to en
tertain her. That was interesting be
trothal news they brought with- them
â Miss Gardie Macfarlane to Major
Potter of the islands.
Visiting Mrs. George Carr at the ?;m
pire is her sister, Mra. yon Benson of
San Diego, a woman of interesting per
sonality, and possessing a Bplendid
ringing voice. During her stay she is
giving much pleasure to Mrs. Can's
friends through her superb â  voice
truly the greatest gift a woman mliy
ask <>f the gods.
The Misses P-*rl and Irenn Babto
have wandered back from their army
Hfe, where they had a beautiful time.
Any heartaches at Fort Snelling?
Wouldn't wonder. Would you?
Mrs. Clem Tobin is prettier than
ever since her Eastern nuptial trip. She
brought back some stunning new
frocks and I know of no young woman
who wears her gowns with mort dis
tingue.
"William H. Munhall, one of Chicago's
leading attorneys, is visiting in San
Francisco, having come West to visit
his aunt, Mrs. B. A. Shaw. Mr. Mun
hall is a stunning chap, with an in
teresting manner and who manifests
excellent taste in admiring everything
ânearlyâ that is Californian. Living
at the Auditorium, where every good
Californian goes when in Chicago, Mr.
Munhall holds quite an acquaintance
with Western folk. He returns in two
weeks to the Sooty City.
That was quite an affair at the Pa
vilion on Friday rfight. While not ex
actly a smart set function, there was
a large sprinkling of the society folk,
and the affair passed off very well.
Here's a chance for the "simple lifers"
to get cloae to nature without leaving
the comforts of home.
Miss Mabel MacAfee, the grand
daughter of James B. Haggin. evidently
doesn't cherish the superstition of
marrying in May, for she has decided
to bo a May bride. Her wedding to
Lewis Butler Preston, son of Mrs.
George R. Preston, of Tuxedo Park, is
scheduled to take place in St. Thomas'
Church on Tuesday, May 16. The mar
riage ceremony is to be accompanied
by a full choral service and promises
to be very smart.
Most of the older Californians re
member the bride as a little giri, hav
ing lived here before the Haggin
hegira for Kentucky and New York.
Louis Bruguiere is said to be a
greater beau now than ever, and is an
exquisite in dress, manner and man
ners. He appears at all the t-martest
functions in New York now, flitting
down, now and then, to Newport.
Anent Easter news of interest to San
Franciscans comes the announcement
of the betrothal of Miss Beatrice
Wright of Sacramento, while staying
with her cousin, Mrs. Philip Kearney
of New York. There was a rumor
abroad a short time ago that George
Crocker sought to make the pretty
niece of his wife his bride, but the
news of her betrothal to another
proves the falsity of the gossip. George
Crocker sailed for Europe last week,
after presenting* a church to a New
Jersey town in memory of his wife,
formerly Mrs. George Rutherford of
thiÃ city.
Coronado is still gay with guests
who linger an, loth to leave the
balmy south for the rigors of an East
ern spring. Many distinguished folk
were there last week, including Nicho
las Murray Butler of New York City,
president of Columbia College; New
ton C. Dougherty, Superintendent of
Public Instruction at Peoria, 111., and
Edwin Hewitt, son of Abram Stevens
Hewitt, ex-Mayor of New York.
Colonel J. Murray Hoag, U. S. A., re
tired, and Mrs. Hoag have taken
apartments at the hotel for a lengthy
stay.
The quiet of Lent is ably abetting
Cupid, for note the recent engage
ments. Two lassies bom under the flag
are true to their colors, giving their
hearts to defenders of our bonny en&
blem. . Miss Caroline Merry, daughter
of Captain and Mrs. William L. Mer
ry of Central America, will wed En
sign Samnel Wood Bryant in the wan
ing of summer. Miss Merry's visit to
San Francisco during the past year
made many friends for her. The knowl
edge that she will become a San Fran
ciscan, so Ions? as the fortunes of a sol
dier allow her, is good new?. Again
the matrimonial calculations of Miss
Mary Fassett and Lieutenant Sullivan
are those of regimental interest, the
fair maid's brother and betrothed be
ing "brother oncers." Miss Fassett,
who has been visiting with her mother
at Angel Island, will become a perma
nent member of the army post in June,
when the wedding ceremony will take
place in the little island chapel.
The wedding of Miss Leila Mann and
Stanley Welch last Wednesday even
ing was quietly celebrated, relatives
and close family friends being the only
guests. The home of the bride's
mother, U^. Frederick Porter Mann,
was attractively decorated for the cere
mony, srÂ«,Â«?n things from the forest,
mingling>-with white flowers, forming
the setting. The service was read by
Rev. Isavid Evans. Eleanor Gage
Mann, -the little daughter of Mr. and
Mrs. Clarence Martin Mann, attended
the bride, who was given away by her
brotner. Clarence M. Mann.
The wedding gown was of ivory
satin, with rose point lace and pearl
passementerie. Mr. and Mrs. Welch
will reside with Mrs. Mann. mere, after
returning from Southern California.
A pretty wedding was that of Miss
Camille Rosenblatt and Alfred S.
Gump last Tuesday evening at the
Concordia Club. Camellias were used
as floral decorations in keeping with the
bride's name. After the ceremony the
guests and relatives were entertained
with dancing which continued for some
length of time. The Concordia is
spacious and admirably arranged
for a largre wedding, being am
ple for the entertainment of one
hundred and fifty or more. Among
those present to wish happiness to the
newly wedded pair were:

City Attorney Long yesterday ad
vised the Civil Service Commission
that mechanics employed in the con

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL. SUNDAY. APRIL 2. 1905.
HERO OPPOSES PLAN TO
ERECT HIS STATUE.
One of the Noble Six
Hundred Modest
in Character.
Lord Tredegar Does
Not Want Stone
Memorial.
Eoecltl Disoatch to The Call.
LONDON, April Lâ lt is very seldom
that a man objects to having a statue
of himself erected as a tribute of popu
lar esteem. By doing so Lord Tredegar
has acquired a claim to distinction that
is almost unique and has shown a
modesty that is more rare than the
courage he displayed when he rode
"into the jaws of death; into the mouth
of hel!" with the Six Hundred at
Balaklava.
South Wales takes a great pride in
the fine old peer and a little while ago
proposed to present him with a na
tional testimonial on the occasion of
the anniversary of the gallant charge
which Tennyson has immortalized. But
when it was suggested that it should
take the form of his own effigy he
protested. He didn't want anything
that savored of self-glorification.
When as Captain Godfrey Morgan
he returned from the Crimea â and
brought his famous charger "Sir
Briggs" home with him as unscathed
as himself â hr entered Parliament and
represented Brenock until the title de
scended to him in 1575, compelling him
to .'oin the Honse of Liords. There he
has since represented all Wales.
A fine sportsman, a scientific' agri
culturist, the kindliest of landlords â
he owns 40,000 acresâ and a generous
contributor to wise philanthropy, he
has si*eatly endeared himself to the
Welsh folk. To the world at large he
is known as the breeziest of charity
bazaar openers, always sprightly and
patriotic, but with perhaps an undue
tendency to regard Welsh as the
tongue of the angels. He is 74 years
old and despite innumerable tempta
tions has remained a bachelor.
For the last five years he has been
Lord Lieutenant of Monmouthshire and
his seat in that county \s a fine old
red brick mansion designed by Inigo
Jones and approached by a magnificent
avenue of chestnut trees. His brother
and heir-presumptive is 70 and a bene
dlrt with sons and grandsons to per
petuate the Morgan name and cherish
thp Morgan pedigree. This, it may be
said, goes back to the dawn of time
when the Morgans \\er<> Welsh kings.
BALFOUR HIRES
YANKEE EIPERT
Engiisfe Premier Follows Ex
ample of King and Engages
Young American Chauffeur
Special Dispatch to The Call
LONDON. April 1. â Following King
Edwards example, the Prime Minister,
A. J. Balfour, has just engaged an
American chauffeur. The latter's
name is Walter Muhler and he comes
from Jersey City. Muhler is 25 years
of age. He left the United States about
three months ago to visit his brother
in Berlin, who is in the German Em
peror's service as chauffeur. Learn
ing that Muhler was at liberty, Balfour
communicated with him recently and
his engagement followed. ' Among
motormen here he is regarded as even
a more expert driver than Oliver Stan
ton, who pilots the King's car.
The Prime Minister is quite as much
an enthusiast in motoring as he is in
golfing, so young Muhler will have
plenty to do. It is said that it was
on the recommendation of the King
that the Prime Minister sought an
American driver. He had tried men
of various nationalities, but found
them all wanting, or at least not up
to the standard of his requirements.
Competing Telephone Sold.
The Augusta Telephone Exchange, or
ganized about five years ago to compete
with the Southern Bell Company and
operating the Strowger Automatic sys
tem, was sold before the courthouse door
yesterday and was bid in by L. C. Hayne
for the sum of $15,000. The sum real
ized, after paying costs, will pay less
â  than 50 cents on the dollar on the'bond*
j and the large list of unsecured creditors
! and the stockholder* will get nothing.
i ThÂ»Â» plant cost more than $100,000. It Is
rumored that the property was bid in
for the Southern Bell Telephone Com
pany. â Atlanta Journal. Georgia, March

Kesidents of Davisville Or
ganize to Advance the
Varied Interests of Yolo
Special Dispatch to The Call
DAVISVILLE, April 1. â Davisville
is awakened along lines promotional
as she has never been before. Her
citizens are awake to the fact that a
great agricultural institution is to be
established in California, to be tanown
and designated aa the University
Farm and for the use of the College
of Agriculture of the State of Califor
nia. They believe that Yolo is the fa
vored county of this State 3,0 far ad
location, soil and facilities are con
cerned and they are also convinced
that of all of Yola County no section
can surpass Davisville.
With the idea of promoting the wel
fare of Davisville and vicinity a mass^
meeting was held Thursday afternoon.
The meeting was called to or
der by B. B. Tuttle and the

retary. V
A discussion of the feasibility of of
fering a site for the agricultural farm
followed and M. V. Sparks, a wealthy
land-holder, offered a site for the
farm.
A motion that a committee of seven
be\ appointed to serve as a committee
on location of the agricultural farm
vraa unanimously adopted and the fol
lowing named were appointed: G. W.
Pierce, chairman, with B. B. Tuttle,
G. K. Swingle. O. B. Wilbur, Dr. W.
E. Bates and the chairman and secre
tary. A finance committee, as follows,
was next appointed: P. P. Smith, M.
V. Sparks and J. W. Anderson.
A committee of five was also ap
pointed to study and report on the
feasibility of the forming at Davis
ville of a permanent organization that
should have for its purpose the con
tinual promotion of tho welfare of
the town, possibly a Board of Trade
or Chamber of Commerce. It was the
sense of the meeting that Davisville
was not organizing for the pur
pose of fighting any other sec
tion or sections of the coun
ty, but on the contrary it was hoped
that all would be in accord for Yolo
County and that each section offer its
site and that all sites be submitted to
the committee.

the brigade in the northern part of the
State are now being inspected.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL
joHX D. SPRECKELS Proprietor
ADDRESS ALL COMMUNICATIONS TO
JOHX McNAIGHT Manager
PUBLICATION OFFICE ..THIRD AND MARKET BTREETB. SAN FRANCISCO
AY APRIL 2, 1905
CIVIC RIGHTEOUSNESS.
WE use terms solely in their secular meaning. That which
procures upright and stainless and dutiful municipal gov
ernment is civic Tightness, the righteousness of spirit among
the citi7< ns of the city. That San Francisco needs to be moved upon
by that spirit no longer admits of doubt. There is no need to deal
with individuals, for the conditions speak for themselves. Without
contending that the government of this city has ever, for a consid
erable time, been kept upon a high plane, it is evident now that its
moral tone is low. and perhaps lower than at any former period, ex
cepting only the conditions that were found to be corrigible only by
the Vigilance Committee of creditable memory.
It may be only an unhappy conjunction of circumstances, but
the official attempts' to hamper the Grand Jury and prevent it making
inquiry into city affairs and the conduct of officials have left an im
pression that There are revelations yet to be made. What has been
revealed is bad enough to justify the awakening of the spirit of civic
h indictments as have gone to trial before a petit
jury a- ttregeotifl a i:rt have been vindicated by conviction of
Ihc accused, a::<i there is no reason to doubt that other indictments
reported and to be found will be in like manner vindicated. Under
I h circumstances it was. to speak mildly, most unfortunate that
â  member of the city administration should interfere to prevent
die Grand Jury going deeper into a ledge of corruption that had ai
- > high in crime.
The m is produced that the worst is not yet known.
The fetid coadttions in the Hoard of Works and the Police Commis
thc stomach of partisanship to such a degree thai
men of all parties, who desire that the city be morally as well as
physically clean, and who know that this can only be when the char
ter of V nunent is upright, desire to make the effort to
better things by acting in common. As long as good citizens are in
the perpetual conspiracy of the push against decency will
be active. The political gutter v.il] reek as long as the people will
stand the stench. As long . i^izes for holding its nose
when it approaches die place of municipal power, instead of going
there with disinfecting purpose, the same old odor qi graft, greed
and corruption will attract the political buzzards.
Mere expression of indignation is ineffective. The rising of
righteous wrath without righteous action is as powerless as the
force of a zephyr against Diablo. How can men be indifferent to the
;:ati<m when they see the Grand Jury, that is doing its duty and
the Auditor who i> doing his. pursued almost to their official undoing
at the n of officials who admit their dishonesty by striving
might and main to prevent an honest inquiry into their actions?
We are persuaded that the citizens are not indifferent, and that
they want to secure a government that will answer the best aspira
tions of the cleanest men. Rut if they stand apart, each nursing his
indignation, all will have more than they can nurse later on, when
the united push goes up against a divided citizenry and crushes it.
The present state of the government is partly and unfavorably
known. The "system" has representatives in important places of
power and also in the penitentiary. If the united "system" meet a
divided people we may expect in the future less difference between
its representatives in jail and those in office.
Obviously what is needed is a center, no matter how small at
first, around which civic righteousness can rally. Who will plant
the standard and sound the call to duty? Surely the spirit of the
Merchants' Association that has shown such fine results and is
Still urging forward the work that it began under so great difficulties
is not confined to the members of that excellent organization. It is
general and moves thousands of voters who need only to know the
way to make it effective It will not do to wait until men who
have political aspirations themselves make a move, for such are al
ways looking at the weathercock to see if the wind blows the way
they want to go. The move must be made by men who have no
political ambitions, but who have that nobler ambition to make their
government cleaner and of less evil report, and a thing of fear and
awe to evil doers.
It is quite likely that the agents of the push will be found busy
in the midst of the reformers, promising a new deal entirely and
deprecating the conditions which require it. This will mean that the
push intends to shuffle and cut and make the new deal itself, and
if honest men are deceived in taking the hands dealt to them by the
candidates of the push, they will find that they voted for the same
old "system" to be run by new \nen. Let us therefore smash the
"system," which can only be done by high and independent union
and concerted action. To what quarter will the people turn for the
needed organization?
THE DAY OF REST.
REST is an art. It is one into which we should serenely let our
selves be borne by obeying the command. "Thou shalt rest."
Sunday is specially the day on which grace should be let
develop that art in us as gently as does nature expand and unfold the
flowers. On those days we toil not, nor spin ; yet will grace array
us with that glory which comes of quietness and assurance if we
yield ourselves to the spirit of rest.
From its very nature the art of resting differs from other arts of
life in this, that it must be accepted as a gift. To rouse ourselves tc
win it as we win other prizes would even in the act of strenuousness
take out of it that which is its essence. Yet to possess it fully would
enable us to practice the strenuous life more wisely. Life in mod
ern times is becoming so busy, so swiftly moving, so multiplex in its
duties, that to really rest on Sundays will to many workers seem im
possible without neglect of other duty, but the art of resting may
be so perfected that the necessary work of the Sunday may be done
in a restful mood that will itself obey the spirit of the command.
The advantage of doing the necessary Sunday work in a restful
spirit would not be for that day only, but would help to form the
habit of putting somewhat of repose into the more strenuous work
of the week, so that whatsoever there is of power in it may go into
the doings of the other six days. It is not so much work itself that
tires as the worries of work. The vexations that we let come, the
impatiences and the lack of system, wear more than the toil. The
friction of the mechanical machine soon wears it out unless oil be
provided. With the human machine the mood of repose is the oil
which prevents this friction.
In the art of combining rest with work there is a suggestion in
the skill with which the bird's wings bear it through the air. There
are times when the efforts are, and must be, most strenuous, and at
others the flight combines accomplishment with a repose of wing that
seems almost complete rest. The bird is using the force of the law of
gravity its wings had gained by toiling to a height, and then augment
ing that stored energy with the power of the wind to bear it where
the bird wills. So there are many* opportunities in which stored-up
power may be used in restful ways which yet will be effective work.
It is. of course, a Sunday thought that this work done in restful
mood will be closer to thoroughly right work ; and as Isaiah tells us
such work shall be peace, and "the effect righteousness, quietness
and assurance forever." "So shall we dwell in peaceful habitation,
and in quiet resting places."

âATLANTA CONSTITUTION.
VOTE AS YOU PRAY.
MINISTERS and laymen of many
of the Philadelphia churches are
praying for the conversion of the
Mayor of that city, Mr. Weaver, and
that he will banish vice from the
Quaker City, says Leslie's Weekly. A
great religious revival is said to be
sweeping over the town, a manifesta
tion similar to that which many sec
tions of this country are experiencing.
We have no desire to discourage the
prayers of the righteous, for they are
still of much avail, but we hope we will
not be regarded as intrusive or skep
tical when we ask the good men and
women of Philadelphia, who are now
down on their knees for the conversion
of the Mayor, what they were doing on
ASTOR AND THE POET.
JOHN JACOB ASTOR and his son
rigidly attended to business in the
Jiame office â a little one- story
building in Prince street, Just east of
Broadway, writes Burton J. Hendrick,
in the April McClure's. Their constant
companion there was Fitzgreene Hal
leck â Marco Bozzaris Halleck. Halleck
became a clerk for Astor in 1832, and
worked seventeen years. The employ
ment, he himself said, was not "profit
able, but permanent." Astor warned
him when he began not to talk to any
INVISIBLE EYEGLASSES.
Invisible eyeglasses, sometimes used
by actors, are not so numerous as the
idea would suggest, according to a
theatrical man, and they can only be
had to order and in certain shops.
Richard Mansfield is credited with
having invented them, or at least of
having first worn them, for roles in
which the eyeglasses would make the
impersonator of the character look
ridiculous. As a matter of fact, an
actor's eyes have to be very far gone
to prevent him from going through
his work without glasses. Invisible
glasses are simply very small and
made to fit in as close to the eye as
possible. The eve lashes touch them
so constantly as to make them re
quire cleaning after every act. The
nose piece and clamps which hold them
on are also as small as possible, and
sometimes flesh colored. Even at that
they are not really invisible, because
when the light strikes them at a cer
tain angle they are sure to give oft* a
reflection which reveals them.
In a great business there is nothing
bo fatal as cunning management.â
Junlus.
election day, when he was swept into
power by a great plurality. Is there
not a time to work as well as to pray?
Had the ministers and the members of
the churches, men and women, of the
city of Philadelphia pledged themselves
before the election of Mayor Weaver to
vote against him or any one else who
would fail to purify the city, and had
they gone a step further and named
one of their own supporters for the of
fice, could they not have elected him?
We doubt if such a combination in any
city of the country could be overcome
at a municipal election. It is not too
late for the good people of Philadelphia
to redeem the fame of their fair city,
but they must get out of the skirmish
line and into the thick of the battle.
one of his wealth. The two men be
came great friends. Halleck spent
months with his patron at his country
seat and became one of the trustees of
the Astor Library- The poet frequently
rallied the old man on his wealth,
"Why, Mr. Astor," he would say, "if I
had $200 a year and was sure of it I
would be content." The great land
owner took him at his word, and in his
will, much to the amusement of Bohe
mian New York, left Halleck an annu
ity of $200.
SOCIETY MANNERS.
She was plainly irrftated about some
thing and sat pouting as she ate in a
downtown restaurant, and not saying a
word to the man with her, evidently her
husband. Before the luncheon was fin
ished another man came In. The hus
band knew him and called him over to
their table and introduced him. The
woman was then all amlrks and smiles.
Her anger disappeared completely, and
she even included her husband in her
sunny views of life.
"That's apciety manners all right,"
said a girl at another table; "but did
you ever see anything so foolish. It's a
good guess she wants a hat or money
to buy something of the sort from her
husband and is going to pout till she
gets it, but what a contrast her manner
is to the man she's never seen before
and isn't likely to see again! It must
look as absurd to the husband as it
does to us. If ever I have a husband
I'll not set about it that way when I
want to get something out of him."â

A COUNTRY minister in Scotland.
who was much annoyed by two
members of his congregation,
Macpherson and Mackintosh, sleeping
during the sermon, hit upon a way to
put an end to this state of matters.
Calling on Mackintosh, he said: "By
the way, Mr. Mackintosh, have you
ever noticed Mr. Macpherson sleeping
during the sermon?" "Many a time,"
replied Mackintosh, virtuously. "Well,
next Sunday you might sit beside Mac
pherson and try to keep him awake."
"I'll do that, sir," said Mackintosh.
Then the minister went to Macpherson
and went through the same programme
concerning Mackintosh. Next Sunday
it was highly amusing to anybody In
the secret to see Mackintosh and Mac
pherson sitting next to each other
other, both perfectly wide awake.
QUAIL WAS NOT A BIRD THERE.
AT a London dinner party the res
taurant waiter was being dis
cussed, and Gerald Lowther, the
new English Minister to Mexico, said:
"You should see the woolly waiter of
100 American mining towns.
"The woolly waiter serves you in his
shirtsleeves, with a cigar in his mouth.
One day an Englishman ordered quail
of such a person.
" 'Quali?' said the waiter. 'All right,
friend, quail it is. Quail goes."
"And he disappeared in the kitchen,
and in a moment returned with a dish
of pigs' feet.
" 'What's this?' said the Englishman.
'I ordered quail.'
" 'Well,' said the waiter, 'ye've got
quail.'
" 'But quail's a bird,' the Englishman
exclaimed.
"The barrel of the waiter's revolver
gleamed as he said in a low, tense
voice:
" 'Not here.' "
ENGLISHMAN'S SENSE OP HDMOR.
AY instance of the density of the
average Englishman's sense of
humor is related by an American
who has just returned from a tour of
several months in the British Isles,
says the Baltimore Sun. The Amer
ican was walking along a street in
a small English town early one morn-
Ing holding in his hand a letter which
he desired to mail.
"Pardon me," said the American to
a dignified gentleman whom he met,
"but do you know where the postofnee
is?"
"Yes," replied the Englishman, pass
ing by.
The Yankee laughed, and the Eng
lishman, turning, asked apologetically:
"I beg your pardon, but did you want
to mail your letter?"
"No," said the American controlling
his desire to laugh outright.
The Englishman looked relieved and
bowed a good-morning.
TOOK IN TOO MUCH TERRITORY.
CZ ORMBR Congressman H. St. George
I Tucker of Virginia during a recent
â  visit to Baltimore, the Sun says,
repeated a story of a Virginian who
had been indulging too freely In the
flowing bowl and who had become over
confident of his own greatness. Look
ing around at his companions, the Vir
ginian boasted:
"Gentlemen, I can lick any man In
Richmond."
Nobody took up the challenge, and
the Virginian returned to the charge.
"Gentlemen," he said, "I can lick any
man in the whole State of Virginia."
The words were hardly uttered, the
narrator said, before a tali, lean, sia
âPHILADELPHIA INQUIRER.
ewy man from the western part of the
State gave the boaster a thrust that
sent him sprawling on the floor.
Like Owen Wister's famous nameless
hero, this Virginian had a sense of
humor, and as he slowly picked himself
up he turned to the group and drawled:
"Gentlemen, I'm ready to acknowledge
that I kivered too much territory."
CASE OF EXTREME CADTION.
HE. BUERMEYER, the president
of the Amateur Skating Associa
tion, tells the Baltimore Herald a
story of extreme caution as illus
trated by an old Boston man in the
tavern:
"This Bostonian sat one evening in a
tavern drinking beer with three com
panions of his own age. The others
drank their beer slowly â a sip or two
every five minutes. But the old Bos
tonian, the moment a full glass was set
before him. drained it down in a Jiffy.
"The friend on his right noticed his
queer conduct.
" I say, Alexander,' he said, 'why do
you always swallow your drink in one
mouthful?' .
" 'Once.' the other answered, 'I had
my glass knocked over.' "
WHEN KIPLING VISITED QUAY.
WHEN Rudyard Kipling was in
this couhtry he was commis
sioned to write impressions
about the chief political boss of the
United States, Senator Quay. Kipling
went to Beaver and called o* the Sena
tor, whom he found, as was usual, in
his library. The talk was about books.
In a Bhort time, so it seemed to the
British writer, Mrs. Quay came in, and,
after Mr. Kipling had been presented,
she urged him to stay to tea. Kipling
stayed, and after tea he and the Sena
tor returned to the library, which was
such a one as he did not expect to find
in any home in America. More talk
about books followed, until, to Kip
ling's amazement, the clock struck 11.
Then, mindful of his commission, he
made arrangements to call again the
next day. Going to the telegraph office
Kipling wired his publishers something
like this: "Unable to find the boss
politician. But if you want it will
write impressions about the best liter
ary critic in America."
CHEAPER BOARD FOR CANNON.
SPEAKER CANNON is a great lover
of green corn. He boards at the
Arlington, and one day took one
of his Illinois farmer constituents to
dinner with him. Cannon made his
dinner on green corn, eating seven ears.
The farmer asked him how much he
paid for board at the Arlington, and
Cannon replied, "Six dollars a day."
"Well," said the farmer constituent.
"Joe, don't you think it would be
cheaper for you to board at a livery
stable?"
An Automatic Calculator.
To the housewife with a poor head
for figures and the jaded business man
who has much adding to do, a new
invention from Germany, soon to be
placed on the British market, should
prove a great boon, says the London
Express.
The invention is an adding machine,
made of steel and aluminum. It is
about six Inches long and can be car
ried in its neat leather case in the
breast pocket
There is a keyboard of nine figures
and an extra spring to register the tena
and hundreds. Long columns can be
added up merely by pressing the keys
and the result is showri on a small dial.
The machine will add up to an un
limited amount.

in the process of making
by current events passing
into the recorded page, but
the process also goes on by
means of the recent re
cent researches by which modern ad
vances in all sciences contribute to
throw more light on old history and so
make it, in a measure, ever new for
our reading and rereading. Both these
processes have entered into the mak
ing of the new "History of All Na
tions" a stupendous work. in twenty
four profusely illustrated volumes, un
der the general editorship of John
Henry Wright, professor of Greek in
Harvard University.
The first five volumes, covering the
period of antiquity and the countries
of Egypt, Asia, Greece and Rome, are
now out. and' all are most impressive
in the thoroughness of their picturing
and mapping, and very interesting in
the pleasing style in which the great
events of historic antiquity are lv-
minousiy focused for us into a few con-
I but broadly enlightening vol
umes.
for the worth of the work in the
r of accuracy it takes a thorough
arship to pass Judgment upon it,
> have such a judgment from the
ient of Columbia University,
- Murray Butler, as to his irh
ikMl that the work so far as he had
able to examine it is not only his
ally accurate, but o-ne which pre-
A a "very skillful marshaling of
nmense array of facts." This ac
- also guaranteed by the schol
p of the writers and the high po
ey hold in the educational
d. The pleasing and attention
ning way in which this array of
; resented to the reader is a
f-aturt- existent in th*- work which the
â  ncr can appreciate and
h wili bring It much favor.
Merely to state a bare outline of
v hat the work is will make us com
-nd the comment made upon it
by Daniel Coit Gilman, president of
Carnegie Institute, Washington, name
ly "I am appalled by its magnitude."
It devotes five volumes to antiquity,
covering first ancient Egypt and West
ern Asia, being the beginnings of hu
n an civilization, the social life, litera
ture, art and mythology of the great
nations of antiquity. Central and East
ern Asia in antiquity take in the early
history of Israel and the Assyro-Baby
lonian empires, the Bible and recent
archaeological discoveries. Anent an-
cient Greece we are reminded: "From
Judea we received our religion, from
Greece our art, our literature and our
philosophy." Then in republican Rome
â we have "the marvelous story of the
little city by the Tiber which became
mistress of the world." This story,
which ie told in volume IV, will prob
ably prove most interesting to the gen
erality of readers of all the five on an
tiquity. In the volume on imperial
Home we have the glories of the age of
Augustus, who "found Rome brick and
left it marble."
Five volumes are devoted to the
Middle Ages and tell us of the races
â  which swept over Europe from Asia
and from which we are descended;
about the Franks and Lombards, and
in the "Age of Charlemagne" of the
achievements of the first and greatest
the Emperors who ruled over "the
holy Roman empire"; the fascinating
story of the crusades, and, last of that
em, comes the "Age of the Renais
sance," an age of great wars and great
intellectual progress.
Modern history takes up ten volumes,
the first of which tells of the establish
ment of Protestantism and "the new
birth of Roman Catholicism." The
French revolution is in volume XVI
and is written by Theodore Flathe, pro
fessor of history of St. Afra, Saxony.
Last of that series is "Contemporary
Europe, Asia and Africa," which is
written by Charles McLean Andrews,
professor of history at Bryn Mawr Col
lege, and William E. Lingelbach, as
sistant professor of modern European
history at the University of Pennsylva
nia. Three volumes tell the story of
America â colonization, by John Fiske;
independence of the New World, by
Fiske. and the modern development of
the New World, by John Fiske and our
own Henry Morse Stephens, professor
of history in the University of Califor
nia, in which there ie a narrative of
the Civil War devoid of sectionalism.
m of the especial and some of the
unique merits claimed by this big work
are that the plan of it is U> take up
the history of the world "period by pe
riod," and not nation by nation; that
it is an absolutely original work, not a
: of extracts pieced together by
editorial laborers; that it is a modern
hiFtory, and that great civilized na
tions have been vying with each other
in the diligent publication of state
papers and documents and in throwing
. open to students the libraries and
archiw-e which hitherto they had jeal
. oualy guarded; that this work meets
the need that the entire history of the
OLD HISTORY AND NEW FICTION
world should be revised in the light of
recent discoveries in all the sciences
which affect our race â biology and so- j
ciology have joined hands with arch- j
aeology and paleontology to widen our '
conception as to the greatness, the sol- |
idarity and the antiquity of our race,
and that everywhere immense activity
in investigation has been met with in
creased facilities for the accumulation
of material unknown to past genera
tions. The whole of the last volume is
devoted to a complete general index of
the world history in one alphabet, cov
ering both proper names and important
topics, and this is considered a unique
feature and a fitting conclusion to the
monumental work.
Perhaps the most interesting of the !
first five volumes series, the age of !
antiquity, is the fourth volume, "Re- j
publican Rome." It contains so much 1
about those notable actions and those
impre&sive personalities, whith even
to modern times still dominate the at
tention almost in equal share with the
great events and the pre-eminent
characters who come so much closer in
time to us. We read of the rise of
Rome to universal dominion: of the
great struggle with Carthage when the ;
Senate left it to the people to decide j
whether they would fight or no; of the !
progress of the cycle, from virtue to
power, from power to wealth, from*
wealth to luxury, from luxury to vice |
and the downfall of the great republic '
and the rise of the empire.
We find the stories of thofee person- j
ages of Rome's rise so well retold that j
we are glad of their recall thus to i
re-enact their parts before us. Has
drubal and Hannibal have their pages j
of vivid presentment ; Scipio Africanus, i
who by his victory over the Car- !
thaginians made Rome the dominant
power of the western world, is treated
in one of the best passages; the de
scription of Tiberius Gracchus, who,
"with the eagerness and impetuosity of
youth, undertook to cure the worst
evils in the state," but who could not
to noble aims and great talents "join
the knowledge of men and their pas- j
sions, and the experience in the af- J
fairs of state, which time alone can j
give, and which were indispensable for
the task before him" is vivid and in
structive; Cato, the "foremost of the
peasant democracy of his generation,
and who made 'the strictness of Cato'
proverbial for all time," is well
sketched as the history hurries on;
Marlus, "a vigorous self-made man who
despised the incompetence and in- j
dolence of the officers from the no
bility," rises first to our admiration
and then quickly sinks below it when, j
on meeting with scorn and hostility, \
"the ambitious homo novus was filled i
with a fierce and persistent rage
against the nobility, which later drove
him to frightful excesses"; there are j
Antony and Cleopatra, spectacular, of
course; there is the great Caesar, who
though "himself early fell, was sur
vived by the many reforms in adminis
tration, and by other creations, which
are the monument of the incredible
activity and wonderful versatility of
the mind of this great man"; but above
all these picturesque characters the
author of this fourth volume seems to
delight in spending hlB best talent In
making us consider attentively his
presentation to us of the hero of the
Punic Wax, Scipio Africanus.
Here is a fragment of that presenta
tion: " â¢ * â¢ When Claudius Nero !
had shown himself unequal to the task ;

firmly believing in his star, not uncon
scious of his power to attract to him
self the attention of the people, with
| lofty ideals, a clear comprehension of
| the relations of events, of extraordinary
, energy and true Roman strength, mod
! ified by Grecian culture, Scipio, a rare
â â  exception in that fierce struggle of the
nations, had kept in his heart a place
for the feelings of humanity and mag
nanimity that, after long years of mur
| der and destruction, had become almost
incomprehensible."
The volume closes with an account of
the downfall of the republic because it
was impossible to continue it after the
virtue which had formed its true foun
dations had ceased to be. It tells of the
magnificent luxury in those last days,
! when villas and gardens were made
' with prodigal expenditure of the mar
bles of Greece, Italy and Africa. A
handsome colored plate gives a glimpse
of the beautiful interior decoration of a
Roman house of that age. It is ex
quiÃite as a sample of the fine art of
home ornamentation; worthy of a J
purer people and worth copying at the j
present time. Alas, the feasting in
these artistic rooms was carried to
shameful excess and the luxury could
not last, for "Along with this a deep
immorality penetrated social life. The
noble dignity of the Roman women had
long since disappeared; countless di
vorces on slight grounds went hand in
hand with loose intrigues. Family life >
in all classes was shaken to the foun- i
dation. Venality was common in all
classes; perjury and forgery were usual
crimes."

CALIFORNIA NOVEL
BY WESTERN WOMAN
Geraldine Bonner, in "The Pioneer,"
has produced another story, which
should have added Interest for the
people of this State, because of Its
local coloring. Like her previous book,
"To-Morrow's Tangle," it tends to fa
miliarize us with the way in which
the conditions of our environment have
helped to mold the characteristics of
the people among whom we live. Books
of this type, when- they are good
studies of human trial and conduct,
as this is, double such advantage as
they possess for the general reader
when they come to the attention of
those who are being played upon by
the forces of the same environment of
which the story makes special study.
This new novel, by a woman who
knows her California as the alphabet*
links the picture of life on this coast
in the exciting times close to the
financial frenzy of '49 to the life of the
succeeding generation in the seventies.
Much of the spirit of those times must
still have direct effect upon our
destinies and the insensible molding
of our natures by association; and
much of it will indirectly act around
us and upon us by the force of hered
ity still holdinc the children of thos*
pioneers to the traits of the energetic
adventurers, and so setting a pace
which new blood and new conditions
may modify but not control.
Considering the feature of the book's
Interest as apart from its study of a
most romantic land and romantic
period, it is the tale of the fatherly
love which a man of middle age, with
out family ties, felt for the daughter
of the woman he had wished for, and
expected to marry. The man is Colonel
James Parrish, "the pioneer." When
he found himself foiled of his dream of
wife and home he stayed strong
through the stifling process and turned
his attention to building up a fortune
in mining ventures. The man, to whose
impetuous but ignoble wooing the
woman of the pioneer's first love
yielded, did 1 not stay strong; and so
there came about the conditions in
which the daughter of the weak man
needed the saved strength of the pio
neer, and beautifully at the last some
of the bitterness of the thwarted pas
sion passed away in the Joy of its
magic fulfillment by transformation to
a love for the young girlâ pure and un
selfish, like the love the guardian
angel 3 feel.
There are interesting, well presented
side issues to this main one in the
story, but it is that which chiefly*

gives it whatsoever of charm and

RECALLS OLD DAYS
IN GOL6EN STATE
Like listening to a good talker, whose
mind is full of recollections of facts as
fascinating with the romance of real
ity as is the richest of imaginative fic
tion, and who tells them easily, in sim
ple, reminiscent style, as one seated in
a comfortable, big arm chair, by the
fireside among his old friends, and
gives out the stories as they rise pic
turesquely to his memory, is the read
ing Li*3 new book, "The Gold Hunters
of California," written by the pioneer,
Thomas Edwin Farish. The words
"written" and "read" are here used in
order to stick to the matter of fact, but
really the mental Impression left
after the perusal is that we have been
listening with eager ears to tongue-told
stories.
The subject of this old-time talk of
old times is good, and the manner of
handling it is so admirable that it must
delight all Californians, old and young;
we feel so sure that we are getting the
information at first hand, and that the
history told has been a live thing to
the mind which thus vividly recalls it.
The sketchy biographical additions it
gives to our knowledge of the early
days is one of the features of the book.
We get fresh views of the writers,
Bret Harte, Mark Twain and Phoenix;
accounts of the men on whom fortune
smiled so bountifully that she seemed
gone mad with generosity â O'Brien,
Flood, Fair, Afaekay; presentations of
the striking personalities of those who
won by so much of sheer energy and
pluckâ Stanford, Haggln, Miller, Tevis,
James H. Keene. and, perhaps, most
romantic figure of all, Ralston; we are
told of the fighters Jn those fierce duel-
Ing days, and out from among 1 them
stands brightly forth, challenging to
this day our admiration, that demo
cratic scion of English nobility, Fair
fax, who broke all the records of chiv
alrous fighting by staying his hand
when his assailant's life was at his
mercy, saying: "Remember, I have
spared your life for the sake of your
wife and children." The book was
worth the writing to fix that one inci
dent in the memory of men.
There is an interesting bit of gossip
to the effect that General Albert Sid
ney Johnston left it to his wife to de
cide if he should cast in his lot with
the Confederate States; and there is
this tribute to his honorable action
while waiting for Lincoln to accept his
resignation of his post in California:
"Regardless of section a grateful peo
ple will ever revere the memory of one
who kept faithfully his trust, though
Â«t the sacrifice of that which he held
dearer than life itself."
An interesting item is the account of
the prankful mixing of the babies at

been woven by Owen Wister into the

of the early days, is now, though an

BRADY DEALS WITH
TEXAS STRUGGLE
"The Conquest of the Southwest" by
Cyrus Townsend Brady, is a brief
historical sketch of the series of opera
tions which began with the coloniza
tion of Texas and closed with the
Gadsden purchase. It has for sub-title,
"The Story of a Great Spoliation, ' and
shows forth that part of our history in
such a way as to make its contempla
tion a strong argument for the avoid
ance of war. As a mere question of
economy the acquisition of the new
territory by the methods pursued is ex
plained to have been spendthrift folly,
for it could have been bought from the
Mexicans for one-third what it cost.
He quotes a paragraph from the works
of President Roosevelt which proves
that Roosevelt could approve the sub
title of the book, for in his life of Ben
son he speaks of our encroachments
upon the boundaries of our neighbors
in these words: "What became known
as the 'manifest destiny' idea, which,
reduced to ita simplest terms, was
that it was our manifest destiny to
swallow up the land of all adjoining
nations who were too weak to with
stand us; a theory that forthwith ob
tained immense popularity among all
statesmen of easy International mor
ality."
The most interesting part of the book
is that giving an account of the revolu
tion in Texas, with sketches of the
fighters who took part in it. The story
of the famous defense of the Alamo is
briefly but well given, and there are
two spirited pictures, one of "Bowie's
Last Shot" and the other of the "Death
of David Crockett," to help us imagine
that desperate fight to annihilation of
the brave 180 Texans against the 2600
Mexicans who stormed the old mission
church. He says: "The defense of the
Alamo was the most heroic exploit in
American history. * * * The in
scription on the monument erected aft
erward to the defenders of Alamo, at
the State capital at Austin, is entirely
true:
" 'Thermopylae had its messenger of
defeat, the Alamo had none.' "
(D. Appleton & Co., New York.)

"Africa's Appeal to Christendom"
will be voiced in the April Century by
Prince Momulu Massaquoi of Ghen

character. The parents of the young
prince placed him under the tuition of
a Mohammedan priest when he was 8

under Christian influence at a mission
school, and after several years' resi
dence at the mission was baptized and
confirmed.
One of the most widely discussed ad
dresses given by Dr. Felix Adler before

spiritual talk, lifting the subject â one
admittedly the most Important In
American social life to-dayâ out of the
realm of sordid personal Interest and
personal feeling, to a nobler plane. The
widespread interest in this address has
led McClure-Phillips to bring it out
separately in book form in brown
boards uniform with their "Letters of
a Chinese Official."
Little enough is known by American

Here are some nuggets of wisdom
from Annie Payson Call's new book,
"The Freedom of Life " (Little. Brown
ft Co., publishers. Boston), in which
she preaches the gospel of orderly liv
ing:
It is not the work that tires you. It
is the way you do it.
Concentration does not mean strain
ing every nerve and muscle toward our
work â it means dropping everything
that interferes, and strained nervea
and muscles constitute a very bondage
of interference.
Circumstances, however difficult, are
alwaysâ without exceptionâopportuni
ties, and not limitations. Self-oitv is
one of the states that interferes most
effectually with making the right use
of circumstances. To pity one's self Is
destruction to all possible freedom.
"There are three things that prevent
sleep â over-fatigue, material distur
bances from the outside, and mental
disturbances from within. In nine
cases out of ten it is the unwillingness
to He awake that keeps us awake."
Here is a typical passage from the
recently published "Memorials at Ed
ward Burne- Jones," by his widow; "J
believe one thing that drew both men
and women to him was that he never
suspected them beforehand; to him
each fresh acquaintance was new-born.
Never in any sense did he become a
man of the world, and up to a certain
point it was always easy to take ad
vantage of him; press that advantage
too far, however, and he was gone like
a bird from the snare."

PULLING DOWN' DERRICKS.
One of the most -picturesque fea
..-lures in mining for oil in California
. vas the invasion of the residence dis
trict of Los Angeles by the derricks,
.pumping jacks and all the apparatus
, â if the sort that has been used in ex
.trading mineral fuel oil from build
" ing lots in the City of the Angels.' The
:â¢ depression in the oil market is re
ducing the area of the oil producing
limit in Los Angeles. There is almost
- a tptal lack of market for the oil tak
* e"n from Los Angeles wells. About
-. si\ty derricks on Westlake street are
to be torn down under contract with
one contractor *nd the property will
isi\el>- as cfty lots, for
\m nui' h more valuable under
present conditions. This is probably
â¢â¢ the beginning of a general movement.
The Los Angeles Times, under the
.^heading of "The Passing of the City
*Oil District," has the following:
Residences are going up more and more
â¢ ia the oil district and here can be seen, what
* " probably an he seen in no other city in the
vcrlU. hundreds of houses occupied as homes
â¢ with oil derricks and tanks in back and front
yards, on three or even four sides of them.
â¢These conditions are not favorable, however,
J to the growth of residence districts, and with
ihr gradual passing of the city oil fields there
will â¢<â¢ new home tracts opened.
Several of the companies have decided tn
1 retire entirely from business, while others
xraay ci/ntinue with reduced force. It is be-
Si^ved, however, to be only a question of a
few years when the oil fields within the city
limits will be largely a thing of the past,
notwithstanding that there is an annual con
sumption of oil In Loi Angeles County alone
far exceeding 2.<Â»**,v(H} barrels, at the least
calculation, and it is growing all the time.

MIXES IN THE NORTH.
After some months of timbering
and pumping the 500-foot level of the
old Maryland-Idaho mine in Nevada
County has been reached. Ten stamps
are dropping on the ore from the old
dumps.
Extensive operations .will soon be
gin on certain mining cjaims In Trin
ity County. The story as told by local
pa-pers iÂ« substantially as follows:
Th* Swif t Creek Mining and Development
Company, of which S. W. Parr., professor of
applied chemistry in the University of mi
nois, ll Champaign, 111., was pr?sldent. and
â which Is represented on this coast by C. T.
Wilder, owned Â«Â«omÂ« mining lands adolning
that belonging to Gullck, * and this company
and the Gulh-k* have now Joined hands, con-
FOlidating under the name of the Trinity-Sis
klyou Gold Mining Company.
Thtir holdings embrace .'so acres, and in
clud* all of the claims of thÂ» GuHcks as well
as those of the old company. Parr Is the
president of the new company, which Is in
corporated under the laws of Illinois. The
company has plenty of money to develop the
properties, and it is given out that work will
b-;gin as soon as it is possible to get into the
county this spring.
This deal is important not only in that it
relieves Gulick after a lons Btruggte and In-
Mires him a rich reward for his patience and
hard work, but also in the respect that it will
have v bearing on the matter of proving the
character of the mineral district.
The Amador Ledger reports an im
portant development in the Fremont
mine. It says:
The old Cover is included in the Fremont
Company's properties. It will be remembered
that many years ago some of the richest rock
ever seen in Aroador County was taken from
the GoVer. The lead carrying this ' ore was
about two feet wide, and persisted to be be
yond the 1000-foot level. The present company
on reopening the mine, after a long period of
idleness, failed to locate this lead. About a
week ago a miner who formerly worked on
this streak told of it* whereabout*. Follow
ing his directions, the rich vein has been un
covered at the 12V0 level. An upraise is about
to be made from th* 1300 level to strike it
also. The ore is so plentifully sprinkled with
free cold that It is sent up in sacks. None
is sent to the mill with ordinary rock.
PRESIDENTS RULED
BY I' X WRITTEN LAW
They Must Not L/eave thr Country,
Even for a Day.
The President must not leave the
United States even for a day. This is
an old. unwritten law. which has been
respected by all successors of George
Washington, with perhaps one or two
exceptions. This restriction is not im
posed by statute. President McKinley
emphasized his respect for this rule
m his tour to the South and West. It
was unofficially announced that he
\\ ould meet President Diaz of Mexico
somewhere near the boundary of that
sister republic A controversy as to
whether Mr. McKinley might properly
cross the Mexican line, even for a few
hourfc, arose. Early in May, when he
\ isited El Paso. Tex., where he was
greeted by President Diaz's personal
representative, he expressed a desire
to trke a look into Mexicv.
From El Paso there extends into
Mexico the International bridge span
ning the Rio Grande. Whether the
President would dare to cross this
structure or not was the ouestion
which members of his party asked one
another. He did not. He went to thÂ»
bridge and caught a view of the Sierra
Madre. Half way across the bridge was
a line. Stepping over this was putting
foot upon Mexican territory.
President Harrison had ventured as
far as this line ten years before. But
President McKinley did not so much
as place his foot upon the bridge. Pres
ident Arthur was accused of violating
this unwritten law in October, 1883,
upon a pleasure trip to Alexandria
Bay. Thousand Islands. His political
enemies accused him then of venturing
across the Canadian line on a fishin?
excursion. The boundary between Can
ada and New York extends to the mid
dlÂ«> of the St. Lawrence River.
President Cleveland was similarly
accused. On one of his hunting trips
t<- North Carolina he sailed by the
ocean route past Cape Hatteras. His
enemies contended that he ventured
omside the three-mile limit. According
to international law a country's pos
sessions extend for three miles out
side its coast line. Plying the seas far
ther than this is lea^'m6 home terri
tory.
The President must not accept gifts
->f great value from inferiors in thÂ«
Federal service, but he may accept
gifts from foreigners. Grant, McKin
ley and Roosevelt have received gifts
fiom foreign rulers. Several gifts have
been sent to Mr. Roosevelt from the
West.â Exchange.

Among its monuments is one to John
Gower, the poet, who ended his days
in the priory and was buried in the
church in 1402. There is a full leneth
effigy of Lancelot Andrews, Bishop of
Winchester, who died in 1626. His
epitaph eiaims for him "a superior re
ward in heaven on account of his celi
bacy." A rueful recumbent fisrure in
the north transept perpetuates the
memory of Lionel Lockyer, an impeni
tent quack who flourished in the reiirn
of Charles II and died in Jâ¬72. Run in
with his epitaph is an advertisement
for his pills, stating that they

In 1424, the marriage of King James
I of Scotland to Johanna Beaufort was
celebrated there with great pomp and
ceremony. Something over a century
later a very different scene was wit
nessed in the church. Bishop Gardin
er presided over the trial of a batch
of heieticle and some half dozen of
them, including Bishop Hooker, were
condemned to be burned at the stake.
None of those buried in the church
or who figure conspicuously in its his
tory have wrought a greater work for
posterity than the Southwark butcher's
son who emigrated to America and
started the institution of learninc
whose graduates have played such an
important part In the history of their
country. It is eminently appropriate
that a memorial to him should have a
place in the old church. And the be
stowal of tt by Choate brings to a fit
ting close his diplomatic career in Lon
don which has won for him none but
golden opinions In England.
The window will be placed in a chapel
to the left of the choir and will over
look the main road that runs over Lon
don bridge. Hereafter the chapel will
be known as the 'Harvard Memorial
Chapel."
Catering to Women.
New York's newest hotels have set
an example in chivalry to the other
restaurant which these many years
have refused to serve meals after 8
p. m. to women without male escorts.
Hotels, nowadays cater to women in
every way. They have luxurious dress
ing rooms and maids in attendance.
Even the toilet articles are providedâ
powder and perfumes, smelling salts,
pins, etc. The restaurants abroad dis
criminate against women dining alone
in the evening. In London and Paris
it is possible to get served only in un
desirable places. But life abroad Is a
very different proposition, and women
cannot go about alone as they do in
America without occasioning remark. â
Pittsburg Dispatch.
His Ruse Forestalled.
Bishop Ellison Capers of South
â  Carolina, addressing a recent gather
ing of Confederate veterans, spoke of
the excuses husbands give for not
getting home to dinner, pretending to
be detained in their offices by busi
ness, when really spending the even
ing at the club. "These men," he
said, "are fewer than the comic
writers of the press would have us be
lieve, but, nevertheless, here and there
l they do exist. I wish they could all
| be caught as nicely as one of them, a
resident of Columbia, was caught the
other day. He said to his wife, as he
was leaving home in the morning: 'Oh,
by the way. my dear, if I find I can
, not get away from the works in time
for dinner to-night, I'll send you a
note by a messenger.' The wife, in a
tart tone, replied: 'You needn't bother.
! I have already found the note in your
i coat pocket.' "âNew York Tribune.
A Timely Warning.
The Jamestown, N. D., Alert de
serves its name. "This paragraph,"
it says In a recent issue, "refers to a
certain young man in this town (he
knows we mean him) who has a rep
utation that is not the best reputa
tion which, a young: man could have.
This is not libel, it is only fact, when
we state that he has been seen with
as many as three different young la
dies in one week, making love first to
one and then another, as if love was
a light thing to be laughed at. The
best citizens of thÂ«> community do not
like such proceedings and we hope
this article will be noticed and heeded
by the young man before he loses the
friendship of all good people."
CREEK INDIANS DRAW
THE COLOR LINE CLOSE
Won't Have Negroes Formerly Their
Slaves Sit in Council.
The color line is being drawn in the
Creek council for the first time in the
history of the Creek nation. There
are a number of negro members of
both houses of the council, who were
elected by their negro constituents,
who were formerly slaves of the In
dians.
The negroes have equal rights as
citizens of the Creek nation with the
Indians and these rights have never
been called in question until this year.
A few of the Indian members of the
council take the position that the
"Creek" negroes are no longer wards
of the Government, since their re
strictions have been removed and they
may dispose of their land at will.
They argue that with the removal of
restrictions comes relinquishment of
citizenship and therefore their right
ceases to assist in making the laws
of the Creek nation.
As evidence of the feeling among
some of the Indians, negroes who have
been making speeches on the floor of
the council have been called down by
Indian members and reminded in
various ways that their solicitude in
behalf of the Government is not ap
preciated.
The more conservative members in
the council, while they admit that
they would prefer that their member
ship should be confined to Indians,
say that there is no means by which
the negroes can be excluded, and they
do not expect itay attempt in that di
rection.
The race Question is as vital to the
Indians as to the white people and
most of them look upon the negroes
as their inferiors. (
Creeks nor the members of any
other tribe in the Territory will send
their children to school with negroes,
and separate schools are provided by
the Indian governments for both
races. Their presence in legislative
halls is thr natural and unavoidable
result of the action of the Creeks after
the close of the war in allowing their
freed slaves to stay in their country
making them citizens. This gave
them a communal interest in the
common lands of the Creeks and car
ried with it the right to vote and elect
representatives to their councils.
There are a number of highly edu
cated negroes in the Creek nation who
have had considerable to say about
running the Creek Government. These
negroes talk Creek and English with
equal fluency and are not opposed in
their ambitions except by the South
ern element and descendants of old
slave-owners. â Chicago Chronicle.

A NOVEL CASE
Holds That Pearl Found in
Oyster Does Not Belong to
3lau Mho Sold Crustacean
PURCHASER GETS UEM
Opinion Results From Suit
Filed by Restaurant Man
Against Woman Customer
HAMBURG, April 1. â The Supreme
Court here to-day rendered a decision
in the case of a pearl, valued at over
$730, found in her mouth by a woman
who, accompanied by a male escort,
was eating oysters In a restaurant.
The woman claimed the pearl and her
escort supported her claim, but the
proprietor of the restaurant . sued to
recover the gem on the ground that
shells, like chicken bones, were by tra
dition left by customers and were a
source.of profit to the proprietor.
The'court decided that the pearl did
not belong to the woman who found it,
or to the proprietor of the restaurant,
but to the man who paid for the
oysters.
In rendering its decision the court
pointed out that if the ownership of
the pearl were to repose in the restau
rant proprietor instead of the person
who paid for the oysters, then its
ownership might as well be carried
back to the oyster dealer who sup
plied the restaurant proprietor with
the oyster and thence to the fisherman
who took the pearl oyster from its bed.
STARTLING BUT PLAUSIBLE
THEORY OF SHIPWRECKS
In a recent note on the loss of the
Norge on Rockall Island, attention
was called to an inquiry started br
ProfpÃsqr Krogh of Copenhagen,
whether the compass of the Danish
steamer had been disturbed by some
mysterious magnetic influence. It was
shown that in two other instances the
compasses of steamers in the neigh
borhood of Rockall had been deflected
as much as ten to twenty degrees. On
this subject Mr. Arthur Harvey, F. R.
S. (Ca.), writes to us from Toronto to
say that he investigated the question
some time ago, and in a paper on "Ter
restrial Magnetism" he quoted a state
ment that "the influence on the com
pass of a great mass of basaltic rocka
can be traced at a distance of fifty
miles." This dictum, he says, rested on
high authoritrrand there are besides
"authenticated instances in many cases
of the influence being felt for twenty
miles." Mr. Harvey was led to ask
whether masses of rock which ordinar
ily have a slight effect on the compass
could set it all wrong during a mag
netic storm, and whether at such times
submerged reefs derange the needle?
He was assisted by the officers of the
Allan line steamers, who reported cases
of extraordinary compass deflections
near shores, one of the worst being the
south coasts of Devonshire and Corn
wall. This peculiarity, if confirmed,
might explain the otherwise unac
countable stranding of one of the
American liners on the Manacles.
A great number of wrecks have been
piled up on certain parts of the Island
of Newfoundland, especially near Cape
Race, also in the Gulf of St. Lawrence,
and on the Atlantic Coast of southwest
Nova Scotia. The navigators usually
ascribe the losses to erratic currents,
but Mr. Harvey thinks they may be
due to compass disturbances, as the
rocks and headlands are mostly primi
tive basalts. Messrs. Allan and oth
ers have urged the Canadian Govern
ment to make a complete magnetic
survey of these coasts. It seems to be
certain that there exist rocks and
shoals where there is a constant de
flection of the needle. One such is the
region of the Niagara Falls, "around
which the magnetic lines curve re
spectfully, and in several places north
of the great lakes the compass will
scarcely work at all." Rockall may be
a similar spot, the influence of which
is possibly much Increased during
magnetic storms. Our correspondent
makes the valuable suggestion that
ships approaching such places should
be warned by wireless telegraphy,
"Magnetic storm prevailing."â London
Telegraph.
Senator Cullom's Insurance.
Some Washington statesmen were
foregathering, and the talk turned on
personal experiences, according to the
Troy Times. "I have been in public
life for fifty years," said Senator Cul
lom, of Illinois, "and never have been
rich but once. It was la3t summer. I
had a tontine insurance policy that I
had been paying on for a long time.
It came due. They offered me several
plans of settlement, but I decided to
take all the cash they would give me.
That was a little more than $3400, and
it was more money than I had ever
seen all in one time. 1 was rich for
three or four months, and then I be
came poor again, for I spent it all." â
Hew York. Tribune.
In a memorial to the throne the
Governor of Shantung complains that,
notwithstanding the issue of the Em

practice of foot-binding, he finds that

that if their female children" are al
lowed to have natural sized feet it
would be impossible to get them mar
ried.

Uricsol,
the only eyre for
Rheumatism.
If you are suffering from rheuma-
tism there is a chance for yon to be-
come absolutely cured. You may
cure yourself and do it quickly if you
' will lay side your prcjudicr and
tkepticistn.
Every San Francisco druggist sells
Uricsoi, the well-known remedy, and
we hereby authorize them to guaran-
tee a cure.
Uricsol cures rheumatism in the
only possible way it can be cured.
Uric Acid and Uratcs are the cause
of Rheumatism. These are deposited
in the tissues, blood vessels and joints
of the body.
These deposits must be dissolved
and ' eliminated -from the system be-
fore a cure can be accomplished.
Uricsol is a solvent of these and
tones up. the. system, stimulates the
kidneys, liver and bowels and thus
drives them from the system.
Uricsol is harmless, and no injuri-
ous results can possibly come to any
part of your body. .

power, light and telephone wires un
derground. The case was that of Pat
rick J. Murphy, a young switchman,
who was killed by an electric shock
on March 18 near the corner of Fifth
and Minna streets. The testimony
showed that in a storm, while Mur
phy was walking along Fifth street,
a telephone wire was blown from its
fastenings, the end striking him on
the side of the neck. In falling the
telephone wire had crossed an elec
tric light and a trolley wire and the
current burned the wire two inches
into the unfortunate man's neck. In j
its verdict the jury said:
"We are unable to determine from
the evidence what wires caused the
man's death, and censure the city and
county of San Francisco for not com
pelling all corporations to put their
wires underground."

The name of "Presidio Terrace" has
been selected by the syndicate repre
sented by Baldwin & Howell, which is
converting the tract of land on the
west side of First avenue, between
Lake street and the Presidio Reserva
tion, into a residence park. The own
ers closed yesterday the purchase of
the golf club property, which com
pletes the final acquisition of the lands
to be included within the new park,
the other purchases having been made
some months ago. The San Francisco
Golf Club waa represented in the
transaction by Shainwald, Buckbee &
Co.. who obtained through Baldiwn &
Howell the sum of $12,500 for the
property. The lot on which the club
house stands has a frontage of 120
feet on the Presidio wall, with, a depth
of 50 feet on one line and 73:6 feet
on the other. The golf club will oc
cupy the building until August 1, after
which the syndicate will either remove
the building to a lot outside of the
"Presidio Terrace" or sell it. No sales
have vet been made in the "terrace."
Baldiwn & Howell announce that a
definite plan of subdivision has been
derided upon and prices have been
fixed on the lots and reservations are
now being made for those who desire
to purchase. The plan of the park is
very attractive. A seventy-two-foot
avenue is to be extended into the "ter
race" immediately opposite Washing
ton street. At a distance of about 250
feet west from First avenue it will in
tersect an elliptical driveway in the
park, which will also be seventy-two
feet wide. Facing this avenue will be
forty building, lots ranging In size
from 50 to 180 feet front and with
depths varying from 120 feet to 190
feet. Grading and other work have
been in progress on the property for
the last four months, but it will re
quire from six weeks to two months
before everything is completed. The
driveway will be lined with English
hawthorn trees, which are now being
planted. There will be a 13-foot strip
of grass and shrubs on each side of

tha roadway, next to which will be
constructed artificial stone sidewalks.
The roadway of the avenue will be
bituminized. A complete sewer sys
tem has been constructed under the
supervision of the City Engineer.
Spring Valley water mains are being
laid and the San Francisco Gas and
Electric Company will commence the
laying of gas mains within a few days.
It is expected that gas will be used
for fuel purposes only. An under
ground system for electric light and
telephone wires will be installed,
which will do away with the construc
tion of unsightly poles in the park.
Side sewers, water, gas and electric
light pipes will be extended to the
building line of each lot. The "ter
race" will be devoted exclusively to
residences, all of which will set back
a uniform distance of probably about
fifteen feet from the sidewalk. No
house costing less than $7000 will be
permitted within the park.
A plan by which the trees and grass
plats in the park will be perpetually
maintained and the streets and side
walks cleaned and the park lighted
has been arranged. Inquiries for the
lots are numerous.

Potatoes. Onions and Vegetables.
Trade In Potatoes was quiet, as usual at thÂ«
close of the week, but receipts were moderate
and the general tone of the market was one
of firmness. There Is very little fancy stock
arriving, and as a result the cheaper sorts of
table Burba nks. which had previously been very
weak, are showing more strength. Onions were
firm and fresh arrivals of sound Oregon stock
met with prompt sale at an advance. The re
ceni heavy arrivals of Australian Onions,
which it was supposed would be held for ship
ping purposes, were offering In the local mar
ket at S4 25 per cental.
Receipts of Asparagus continued light and,
with the demand brisk both for local uae and
shipping account, the market cleaned up
quickly at sharply advanced prices. Rhubarb
â¢was weak for ordinary stock, while Peas rvere
eteady. although receipts were large. Receipts
of other vegetables were light and prices had
little change.

discovered by the trial board was in the

armored forts so that they would re

postponement of the battleship's de

HOTEL DEL CORONADO, April 1.
Henry James, the distinguished au
thor, is a guest at the hotel since
Tuesday. He is accompanied by
Frank H. Spearman, the well-known
writer of railroad stories, and by Ed
ward Chambers of Los Angeles.
All Coronado romances are not re
served for the "good old summer
time," though the summer girls do
have exceedingly winning ways. One
of the "better than fiction" stories of
the present season claims pretty little
Miss Ame Mueller of Cleveland and
T. P. Thompson Jr. of Bradford, Pa.,
as heroine and hero.
It is said that the wedding will take
place in the spring. Miss Mueller is
an heiress in her own right and Mr.
Thompson is a man of wealth.
James A. Crmtten of Philadelphia
and his son. Rev. J. M. Chatten, were
at the hotel for some days.
Dr. and Mrs. Parks Ritchie are
among the late arrivals from St. Paul.
A. H. Blanehard and T. J. Jacobs have
joined the New York contingent at
the hotel.
N. F. Sargent, formerly of Portland,
who has come to Southern California
to reside, has decided to make his
home at Coronado while doing busi
ness in San Die^o.
Mrs. H. M. Huntington of Hyde
Park.' Boston, and niece, Miss Helen
D. Merriam of Summitt, Wis.. have
taken apartments at the hotel for a
stay of indefinite length.
Dr. Charles A very Lockwood of New
York City writes Coronado friends
that he expects to be at Coronado
during this month, accompanied by
several friends, who are his guests on
the cross-continent trip which is taken
in the doctor's private car.
Charles Anton Dudley, the artist
author, recently home from Europe,
is in Dr. Lockwood's traveling party.
Numerous notable social events are
scheduled to take place at the hotel
during the spring months. Arrange
ments have been completed for the
entertainment at dinner of four hun
dred Mystic Shriners on April 15.
On April 22 will be Woodmen of
the World day at the hotel, 500 mem
bers of the order to be dinner guests,
and later a dary?e will be given in their
honor.
The latest innovation arranged by
Manager Morgan Ross is the English
buffet, which is now an attraction in
the dining-room during luncheon
hour. On the table, which is prettily
decorated, the salads, cold meats and
game arp temptingly arranged.
fSoart-li for the Gjoa.
Customs Collector Stratton received
a letter from the Secretary of the
Treasury yesterday instructing the
captains of the revenue cutters In
northwestern waters to make inquiry
for the missing Norwegian sloop Gjoa,
which has been two years out search
ing for the magnetic north polo and a
northwest passage.

HOPES TO STOP
DREAD PLAGUE
Chicago Physician Says That
Carbolic Acid and Water
Will Prevent Spotted Fever
USED IN AN ATOMIZER
Medico Declares Spinal
Meuingitis Is Contracted
Through the Throat
CHICAGO. April I.â A preventive of
cerebro spinal meningitis, "spotted
fever," the dread plague which is rav
aging New York and Eastern cities and
from which at least one death, that of
an 8-year-old girl, occurred in Chicago
yesterday, has been suggested by Dr.
W. G. Class of the city health depart
ment. An atomizer, a little carbolic
acid and water are the safeguards.
"The disease is -contracted through the
throat," said Dr. Class. "While the
most reliable preventive consists in
staying away from infected places, and
in perfect cleanliness, the disinfection
of the air passages should help to ward
off the disease.
"Use an atomizer and spray the nasal
passages and throat with water con
taining one per cent of carbolic acid.
The disease is not as contagious as
scarlet fever. It begins with a severe
headache and vomiting. I do not be
lieve that the disease will become dan- f
gerous in Chicago."
NEW YORK. April I.â A commission
appointed by the health department to
study cerebro spinal meningitis, which
is causing many deaths in and about
New York, has decided, according to >
Health Commissioner Darlington, on a
diagnosis of the mysterious disease.
"This method," said the Commission
er, "is for physicians to take a lumbar :
culture and examine under the micro
scope the microbe secured from the
puncture at the base of the spine. If
the microbe thus examined is found to
have tiny protuberances resembling
horns, then the disease is unmistakably ;
meningitis."
BERLIN. April I.â Cerebro spinal
meningitis has almost attained the di
mensions of an epidemic. In many dis
tricts of Germany the mortality is so
large that the Government's aid in
combating the disease has been called
for. The malady chiefly attacks the
young, and there have been few cases
where the victims have been over 30
years old. Leading physicians declare
that the disease is contagious.
"THE VIKTVE OF JISTICE"
FATHER SI LLI VAN'S THEME
Eminent Priest Tells of How the
Seventh Comma ndment Is Fre-
quently Violated.
"The Virtue of Justice" was the
theme of an eloquent sermon deliv
ered at St. Mary's Cathedral Friday
nig^ht by Rev. Father Sullivan, the oc
casion being the usual Friday night
Lenten services. The large edifice was
thronged and the remarks of the di
vine were listened to with evident sin
cerity. Father Sullivan said in part.
"The virtue of justice is one of the
most essential points of society. There
are but few who realize the true
meaning of this phrase and conse
quently we find that many a man is
judged wrongfully and injured by nig
neighbor. St. Paul was the great ad
vocate of the virtue of justice and his
teachings should be read and studied
by every Christian.
"The teachings of the great apostle
lead us to the seventh commandment.
"Thou shalt not steal.' How often is
this commandment violated by so
many of us. We may not do so
wrongfully, but there are thousands
of us who break the law time and
again. This is because most of us do
not realize what we are doing at
times. For instance, some of us will
iun in debt so far that we are unable
to pay. and when we find that it is
impossible to settle and that the law
leaves us a-^Joophole, we will let the
matter drop instead of making every
effort to settle our accounts, even if
it takes years to do so.
"Then there are honest men who go
into public office and in various ways
accept things which belong to others.
They may not realize what their acts
are. but they are breaking the seventh
commandment. It is either theft or
robbery. Robbery is taking what be
longs to a man by violence, while by
theft he can be outwitted and
wronged by sharp practice, which
though not against the law is against
the seventh commandment."

"is of little consequence. â  The oppcilie .
is true. Varicoceie la a disease of a

GETS CONTROL
OF HER CHILD
Bitter Contest Is Practically
Brought to a Close in
Winifred Le Febre Case
CONTEMPT NOT PRESSED
Mother Is Triumphant Over
the Effort of David Hyman,
the Parent by Adoption
The proceedings instituted by Mrs.
Grace E. Freitas, wife of a druggist In
I Stockton, to regain possession of her
I daughter, Winifred Le Febre, 7 years of
! age, were practically brought to a close
: in Judge Dunnes court yesterday. The
l case was continued for two months,
; and meantime the child will remain in
i the custody of her mother, and if noth-
I ing unforeseen happens she will con
1 tinue to remain with her.
At the time of the child's birth Mrs.
: Alice Le Febre, its grandmother, gave
it into the custody of Rev. J. W. Dan
; iels of the Children's Home Finding So
; ciety without the mother's knowledge
j or consent. Through him the child went
â  into the possession of David Hyman, a
i jeweler in Oakland, who later trans
i ferred his business to this city. Hyman
took out adoption papers and the child
; was baptized as Fern Beatrice Hyman.
Last year when Mrs. Freitas learned
for the first time where the child could
be found she called upon Hvman and
made a demand upon him for its re-
turn, which was refused. Thereupon
: she applied for a writ of habeas corpus
i before Judge Dunne. At the hearing
1 Hyman declared that he loved the child
, and would do anything rather than
â¢ surrender her. The case was continued,
and meantime Hyman disappeared
with the child. All efforts to trace their
j whereabouts were futile until recently,
: when they were located in Chicago.
Hyman was induced to return with
the child and he appeared in court with
: her yesterday. His attorneys pleaded
his great love for the little one as an
excuse for disobeying the order of the
court, and the Judge in the circum
stances did not iiunish him for con
tempt. Hyman again pleaded for pos
: session of the girl, but the Judge oi -
' dered her restored to her mother, con
tinuing the case for two months.

ORDERS WIRES
TO BE REMOVED
Hewitt Threatens to Enforce
Ordinance That Prohibits
All Overhead Obstructions
As the result of the investigation of
the Supervisors' Finance Committee
I into the failure of the Department of
, Electricity to enforce the ordinance
requiring all wires to be placed under
ground in four designated "districts,
Chief Hewitt yesterday sent notices to
the various companies maintaining
overhead wires to remove them forth
with. The notice says:
"You are hereby notified that in ac
cordance with the power and authority
given me as provided in section 4, or
der 214, Board of Supervisors, I shall
proceed at the expiration of forty-eight
i hours, beginning at 8 a. m. Monday,
April 3, 1905, to take down and re
move poles and overhead construction
remaining in all underground districts
not exempt under the provisions of the
order."
The time limit granted to any cor
poration or individual to remove their
poles in underground district No. 1,
which are used by the fire alarm and
police telegraph until such time as the
Department of Electricity can remove
its wires therefrom, has long since ex
1 pired. The companies whose poles and
Wires are to be taken down by Hewitt
j according to his notification are: The
' San Francisco Gas and Electric Cora
\ pany, Pacific States Telephone Com
| pany, Mutual Electric Light Company,
1 American District Telegraph Company,
1 San Francisco Electric Protective
j Company, Independent Messenger
Company, Bay City Special Messenger
, Service. Municipal Burglar Alarm
1 Company, Spring Valley Water Com
i pany, Western Union Telegraph Com
j pany. Postal Telegraph Company,
I Central Light and Power Company,
; California Special Mesenger Service,
i Pacific Auxiliary Fire Alarm Company,
! Direct Line Telephone Company, So
j cial Telephone Company and Gold and
Stock Telegraph Company.
The San Francisco Electric Protec
tive Company is the burglar alarm
concern which was allowed by Hewitt
to string overhead wires, despite the
fact that its franchise obtained from
the Board of Supervisors required the
wires to be placed underground. Some
of the minor companies named en
gaged in messenger service have re
ceived no permit at all to string over
head wires.

Speaking of the wonderful strides in
four yearsâ from 481.776 bottles in 1900
to over 1.624.000 bottles in 1904 â of the
celebrated brand of Moet & Chandon
White Seal Champagne, the New York
World remarks:
"It is a superb wine â bon vivants,
gourmets, poets have sung its praises;
careful chemists have scrupulously ex
amined it and found it not only free from
deleterious elements, but full of all the
(lualtties that go to make a perfect cham
pagne. In body, bouquet, in every qual
ity wherein a wine can excel, it does ex
cel."
LIFE SENTENCE
FOR MURDERER
Insanity Pretense : of George
Benes Fails ami Jury's Rec
ommendation Carried Out
George Benes. convicted by a jury of
murder in tho first degree, with the
penalty of imprisonment for life. \vas<
formally sentenced by Judge Dunne
yesterday to spend the remainder Â«>f
his life in San Quentin. Efforts had
been made to prove that Benes was in
sanr. but the Insanity Commissioners
reported that he was responsible for
his actions.
Benes" wife. Emma, had left him in
Los Angeles and came to this city.
where she obtained employment at thr
Humboldt House, 1309 Stockton street.
Benes followed her, and on the morning
of December 7. 1903, he confronted her
while she was going to the cellar. H^
asked her to return to him. and on her
refusal he shot and killed her. He at
tempted to shoot himself, hut only in
flicted a flesh wound.
David Robinson and Francis James,
who pleaded guilty in Judge Donne â 
court to a charge of attempted burg
lary, appeared for sentence yesterday.
Robinson was sentenced to serve one
year in the County Jail and James five
months. They broke into the store of
O. L. Cramer, 433 Seventh street, on
February 6.
John Smith, who pleaded guilty in
Judge Lawlor's court to two charges of
burglary, was sentenced to serve four
years in San Quentin on each charge,
the sentences to run concurrently.
Smith, who is hardly out of his teens,
broke into the grocery stores of Mrs.
W. J. Hughes. 1534 Golden Gate avenue,
and John Rusch, 1601 Turk street, on
the night of January 8. When he plead
ed guilty he said he had committed the
burglaries while under the influence of
liquor and in a boastful spirit. His at
torneys had asked that he be allowed
to go on probation, but the Judge, after
making inquiry into his past life,
thought the law should take its course.
USE OF THE TELEPHONE
ON THE CONGO RIVER
Great Heat Renders It Imnossible to
Talk Over the IJnr During
Middle of Day.
The telegraph and telephone lines rf
the Belgian Congo region show some
peculiarities both in the construction
of the lines and their operation, owing
to the climate and the character of the
country.
Where the lines fun through the
forests, the wires are placed as much
as possible upon trees and in other
cases upon iron poles. The wire, which
is of phosphor-bronze, is painted black,
sa as not to attract the attention of the
natives, who lay hands upon all he
copper they can find.
The other brilliant objects of the
line, such as the insulators, are also
painted black. A cutting 30 feet wide
is made through the forest for the line,
fo that there is no risk of fire or from
falling trees.
Besides the telegrar-h offices of Leo
poldville. Kwamouth and Coquithat
ville. there are nine telephone offices
and six cabins. The latter are used for
communicating with the steamboats on
the river.
The first hours after sunset are the
best for telephoning, and It is possible
to telephone direct from Matada to
Kuamouth. o r 380 miles. From the
latter point to Boma, or 410 miles, the
voice is still heard.
After 19 o'clock a. m. the heat Tiakes
it impossible Jo use the telephone,
especially in tne rainy season. This
is du<* to the fact that a return wire
is not used, and the use of the earth
return is accompanied by great dis
turbances in the middle of :he day.
The greatest enemies of th? telephone
lines are the wild animals. In the rainy

RETURNS TO WRITE OF OLD MISSIONS
Charles Warren Stoddard to Visit Scenes of Early Experiences
For more than a year Charles "War
ren Stoddard, poet, essayist and nov
a. veritable dreamer of the South
Seas, has beta a guest of Cambridge.
Mass. For many weeks this charming
iriend of famous men and writer of
Idyls lay at the point of death; then,
when almost to "that land o' the leal."
he w&e coaxed back to thie shore of
tears and smiles. Very slowly during
these long months he has been getting
back his old-time vigor, and, although
it is not hie as yet, that charm of man
ner bo gentle, cordial, so lacking in for
; yet full of a dignity all his own
â quÂ£- :ch have won far him so
many warm friends and made him
â welcome at so many hearthstones â
left him.
He is new to leave his many friends
there to return to California for an
absence of a year. There he purposes
:.g a study of the old missionsâ
OHM grand old ruins of pre-go!d days
that are stationed, like old sentinels,
keeping guard over the coast from
Mexico to Central California.
"I mean to begin with the first, away
in Mexico, and in a series of
articles for the Sunset Magazine de
the pot . .â : of their part
in California c early days," Stoddara
Fays. Just the mention of California
sets him dreaming.
To wander wiih him for two hours
back to old Ban Francisco in its tent
ing days, to roam with him over those
"Isles of the Summer Seas " he iovea
so well, is a treat that must be ex
perienced to be appreciated. There is
h subtle charm In that "dreamer of
dreams" that can be transferred to
paper by no hand but bis.
WARMTH A.YD COLOR.
Those who have read his "South Bea
Idyls" have felt the warmth and color
and watched the rippling, sparkling,
ever fascinating water of that ocean
and felt the power of that dreamy
c. That far-away look that drifts
across his blue eyes; the occasional
roguish flaEh, the low, half melancholy
c. full of kindly sympathy and
humor, need to accompany his story to
g*z its full meaning as the writer re
â  i it.
Mr. Stoddard took his caller back
â * days of '55, when as a boy he
>-d in San Francisro, that wild
range
- the gay, free, reckless
.lent, made a deep impression on
the half-awakened poet. Then a long
his brother around Cape
Horn filled his imaginative nature full
old ocean's subtle charm, whose
Fpell he has never been able to shake
off. Back again as a lad of 16, worry

j pretty emerald of the sea! How many
! long tramps on horaeba.ek I've taken
j over those islands, and how they've
1 spoiled them: Our bungalow, if you
j could only have seen it, that great
rambling home on the cliffs, over
| looking the shining, mellow, shimmer
j ing bay. And such fun as we had,
i the kids and I, when they came home
} at night from the city â card parties.
musicals, everything jolly. All
through the day the fellows were at
I their business in the city and I at my
writing at home, all alone with Sing;
|he dreaming over nil pipe, I busy
1 drawing stories from that magical
I bay.
EARLY EXPERIENCE.
"Thus two years went by, and a day
came when I was ill at ease in that
| ease-inspiring bungalow. I refused to
! eat and lay ensconsed behind my mos
quito netting, appetite gone. The
boys did all in their power to rouse
me, but In vain. My Sing even did his
beet; one morning he appeared be
fore me with a tray on which were
two glasses â it was his maiden cock
tail! a most fearful mixture of Worces
tershire, sauce, oil. everything a
! bottle contains. I drank It â and
'. lived. Even that did not rouse me.
I needed to get my 'boots' and be off
â I'm a two years' clock, not an eight
day. The fever contracted as a boy
â¢ on that first trip round the Horn has
never got out of my veins."
That same restless spirit has driven
him to the isles of the seas, to Asia,
Africa and Europe. His sunny, genial
spirit, the charm of his own dearly
loved southern seas, has made for him
hosts of friends all over the world.
Perhaps no writer of the century
numbers so many famous literary men
and women among his intimate
friends. He was personally acquaint
ed with George Eliot. Emil Zola. Al
fred Tennyson, Abbey, Stevenson,
whom he visited in his own South
Sea isle; Dv Maurier, Rudyard Kip
ling and many, many others.
"Bret Harte brought me up, you
might say." he mused. "We started
the Overland Monthly, in which Bret
Harte did his best work and to which
I feebly contributed. At first Bret
Harte was dissatisfied with my work,
but when I went to the islands and
began to write out my dreams from
there he wrote, "Now you have struck
It.' Then Bret Harte went to London
and I went off on one of my rambles
again."
It was while abroad the last time
that he was appointed to the ohair of
literature In a university at Washing
ton. Mr. Stoddard says very charac
teristically of that period of his life:
FIFTY-TWO PAGESâ SAN FRANCISCO, SUNDAY, APRIL 2, 1905â PAGES 20 TO 40.
"I look upon it as sixteen years lost
out of my life. I did not live. I wad
buried in a classroom!" â so utterly for
eign is any kind of publicity to his
naturally retiring manner. Tet in his
retreat, which he called his "bunga
low.' he managed to have some charm
ing times with his friends.
"A friend of so many great men, I
j Just escaped gneatness," he humorous
|ly remarked. "But 1 learned much in
: the escape I recall once sending some
j of my versus to a number of my fa
; mous friends. Tennyson among the
â¢ number, and the great diversity of
opinions expressed was a lesson in the
, falibility of human criticism. I have
them all now, and look at them occa
sionally when I am discouraged. And
my novel. 'For the Pleasure of His
Company'â well, it was abused, but I
don't mind. I had Kipling's word for
it that it was a 'go.' Such fun as I
had writing it' It is my life's feelings,
my Inmost thoughts of things. And
now I'm ordered not to writeâ a man
who has lived in it! Obey? I could
not! I have written every since
I have been up; you can't break up a
! habit of forty years in that way."
Boston reluctantly says good-by to
I this genial spirit, while he wings his
flight to the land he loves so well, to
wade kr.ee-der.p fa roses and to catch
the strength of that balmy clime. There
j ?.re few choicer spirits in American lit
j erature than Mr. Stoddard. Though he
! may have "just escaped greatness,"
yet he radiated enough genial purity
; p.nd childlike simplicity to attract into
his circle of frier.ds nearly all those
<>f th's world's great souls worth the
' knowing.
STEEL TRUST NOTIFIES
WORKMEN* OF INCREASE
Corporation Will Give More Pay to
Ski Hod Mill Hands and Other
Mechanics.
NEW YORK, April I.â Official
notices have been sent out by the vari
ous companies of the United States
Steel Corporation informing thousands
of workmen of an increase in wages,
beginning to-day. It is estimated that
the increase will amount in round fig
ures to J5, 000, 000. Those who will
receive the increased pay will be the
laborers, skilled mill hands and the
class of mechanics now receiving
moderate wages.
Agrc-ements with tin plate, sheet
ste^l and other workers, which expire
on June 30 next, will not be changed
at present. It is expected that higher
wage scales will go into effect in these
departments after the present agree
ments have expired.
The subjects of the Czar at home are giving him almost as mnch trouble as the subjects of the Mikado are giving him in
Manchuria. From all parts of Russia come reports of uprisings in which blood is shed by the peasants in what seems a vain
endeavor to wrest from their Emperor a recognition of their rights. The infernal machine is their weapon, particularly in cities.

Feet Blown Off
by Bomb of an
Assassin.
LODZ. Russian Poland, April I.âPo
lice Commissioner Szabalovicz of the
second district was seriously Injured
to-day by a bomb, which was thrown
at him in the street. He had been sum
moned by telephone to come to the
office of the Chief of Police, and start
ed on foot, followed by a policeman.
The former noticed at the corner of
Konstantinosk and Zawarski streets a
poorly clad man carrying a basket.
as Szabalovicz approached the man
suddenly hurled a bomb, which ex
ploded with terrific force, blowing off
the Comrr.issio2:er's feet and severely
wounding him in the breast. It is fear
ed his injuries will prove fatal. The
force of the explosion was so great that
it tore a hole in the ground two feet
deep and twelve feet in circumference.
The accompanying policeman drew
his sword and wounded the Commis
sioner's assailant on the head. When
the prisoner was searched a loaded re
volver and some cartridges were found
in his pockets. He is reported to be
dying from th=: sword cuts received.
The explosion was heard about five
miles away. All the windows in the
neighborhood were shattered. People
in adjoining houses were thrown to
the floor. Szabalovicz is hated by the
Socialists. He is charged with killing
a Socialist during the disturbance here
ir; December last.

HARBIN, April I.â Business is para

is shown. A majority of the female
population is leaving Harbin.
It is believed that the Japanese are
preparing a bold turning movement,
probably to the eastward, and the Rus

PRISONERS WELL TREATED.
False Report of Japanese Suicides in
Russia.
ST. PETERSBURG, April I.âlnves
tigation of reports published in Lon
don, to the effect that numbers of Jap
anese prisoners confined at Medvid
have committed suicide reveals the
fact that but one man killed himself.
He had become ill en route from the
front and regarded his case as incura
ble. The American embassy, which is
looking after the interests of the Jap
anese prisoners, is entirely satisfied
with their condition and praises the
kindness shown them by the Russians.
MYSTERIOUS ASSAILANTS.
Masked Men Ransack Lodging-Houses
and Attack Inmates.
HELSINGFORS, Finland, April I.â
The populace is greatly aroused by the
renewal of ransacking of lodging
houses by masked men, who bound and
gagged the Inmates and searched
everything. On Saturday night these
men destroyed the furniture of board
ing-houses when they discovered in it
a picture of Maxim Gorky. The peo
ple suspect that they are agents of the
police, but this the latter indignantly
deny. No arrests, however, have been
made.
RUMORED PEACE TERMS.

be turned over to Japan for cession to
China or to an international syndicate,
upon a consideration of $125,000,000,
which Japan will accept in lieu of in

Tschertkoff Cor
dially Hated
by Poles.
Special DUpatcb to The Call.
CRACOW, April I.â Probably the
most hated man in all Russian Poland
is his Excellency the Governor General
of Warsaw, as he is officially styled.
In reality, however. General Tschert
koff rules over all the ten governments
which constitute Russian Poland of
to-day, and is more commonly known
as Governor General of Poland. This
position is perhaps the highest dignity
in the service of the Czar. Poland dif
fers from the various governments In
Russia proper, as it is still ruled more
as a conquered province. The Gover
nor General has committed to him
the destinies of 10.000,000 people.

THE OBJECTS OF THE HATRED
OF THE UNHAPPY POLES.

7.000,000 of whom are peasants, for
the most part unable to read or write.
General Tschertkoff has an official
salary of 50.000 rubles a year ($25,
000), a palace in Warsaw, a castle
in the country as a summer resi
dence, horses and carriages, an army
of servants and numerous other per
quisites and privileges. He has
also at his disposal an immense
secret service fund for the expendi
ture of which he has not to give any
account. All these dignities and emol
uments, however, will soon pass from
his grasp, for the general la 76 years
of age, suffering from an incurable
disease, and it is said mat his succes-
Bor haa already been selected, and, in
fact, may come here at any time.
The Governor General will go away
"unwept, unhonored and unsung." The
Poles hate him with a bitter hatred for
his oppressions, his corruption, and his
evil influence upon their beloved coun
try. The new man may be infinitely
better â much worse, they say, he can
not possibly be.
HIS RISE TO POWER.
Michael Ivanovitsch Tschertkoff,
Governor of Warsaw, Ataman of the
Cossacks of the Don. General of Caval
ry, Aid-de-camp to the Czar, and mem
ber of the Imperial Council of the Em
pire, was bc-rn in 1829. He was edu
cated in the school for imperial pages
at St. Petersburg Â£nd entered the army
in 1848. He took part in the defense
of Sveaborg, Finland, against the 'Fran
co-English fleet in 1854.^and fought in
the Caucasus in 1858. In 1864 he was
appointed Governor of Volhlnia, and
five years later was made a lieutenant
general. He also became Ataman of
the Cossacks of the Don, ataman
meaning General of Cossacks.
In 1877 he was nominated Governor
General of Kieff. when he first came
into notoriety. His administration is
said to have been infamously corrupt
and bad, even for a country like Rus
sia, where official corruption prevails
generally and, in :act. Is almost ex
pected. But Tschertkoff exceeded the
usual limits of transgression. He
abused his authority in every way and
there were no bounds to his cupidity
and extortions. He speedily amassed
wealth and purchased an enormous es
tate at Kahorlik in Southern Russia,
out of the proceeds of his ill-gotten
gains. Finally his maladministration
of the province became a public scan
dal, which attracted the attention of
the authorities in St. Petersburg, who

found it was even more than they could
stand, and General Tschertkon! waa re
moved from his post.
As is common in Russia when offi
cials of such exalted civil and mili
tary rank are removed from office, the
general was "raised" to the rank of
an Imperial Councilor. This was in
1881. and he remained out of office for
nearly twenty years. General Tschert
koff was the faithful and devoted serv
ant of the late Czar Alexander 11, and
acted as his personal aid-de-camj> dur-
ing the Turko- Russian war. Their in-
timacy was not entirely unconnected
with General Tschertkoff's wife, whose
union with the general was brought
about in a very extraordinary manner.
PURCHASE OF HIS WIFE.
Madame Tschertkoff. who is still liv
ing, was the wife of a minor police of
ficial named Vereschagin. and a very
beautiful and attractive woman. It is
said that she is a Jewess. The late
Czar saw her at some maneuvers and
ordered that, she be presented to him.
and they soon were on very friendly
terms. General Tschertkoff, who vras
attending the maneuvers, saw the lady
also and was deeply enamored o! her,
and finally bought her from her hus
band for 30,000 rubles (J15.000) and
married her.
Such a seemingly extraordinary af
fair is not uncommon in Russia, and is
done in a perfectly legal manner,
through divorce procedure. The hus
band for a consideration â in this ca*e
the 80,000 rublesâ permits his wife to
have a divorce, and takes upon himself
the role of the guilty party. Under the
Russian law only the innocent party
may marry again, the guilty one may
not do so unless the other should die.
In these cases it is considered rather
a shabby thing If a husband isn't will
ing to accommodate his wife in this
manner, and sacrifice his character
for her sake.
Very often the man marries again
without waiting for his former wife to
die. as it is not difficult to find a priest
who will not ask too many questions
and insist upon too much evidence re
garding his legal qualifications for en
tering the matrimonial state. General
TschertkofTs marriage turned out to be
a very happy one and madame is very
popular in Warsaw society, much more
so than the general.
Some few years after his marriage
the general was told one day that a
stranger wished to see him alone on
important business. He was shown
into the room and addressing the
Governor, said: "Your Excellency will
remember me no doubt, as you did me
the honc-r to take my wife some time
ago. I come now to inform your Ex
cellency that I have another wife, who
Is younger and handsomer, and much
better altogether than my first wife,
and if your Excellency wishes I will let
you have her at the same price." What
his Excellency answered is not report-

LITTERED WITH
MUTILATED DEAD
Grewsome Details of Awful
Massacre Are Received
in London.
Special Dlsratch to ThÂ« Call.
LONDON. April L â Correspondence
Just received from Baku gives a vastly
fuller account of the horrors of the rÂ«
j cent massacre there than the Russian
j censors allowed to be transmitted by
I telegraph. At the end of the slaughter
I of Armenians by Tartars in the Cau
casian town 500 bodies were counted,
most of them shockingly mutilated.
The total number of Armenians killed,
according to some estimates, is not less
than 1000. hundreds having perish-
I the fTames that consumed their homes.
; Many women and girls were among the
â  missing, and unprintable stories are
told of the treatment received by them
from their Tartar assailants.
Nearly every street In Baku contained
its ghastly litter of victims, stretched
out just as they had fallen, the Inhabit -
i acts being too terrified even to cover
|up the faces of the dead. An English
, resident at Baku has sent a photograph
|of one of these scenes, which Is for

British Government. But as the atroci
ties occurred in Christian Russia, and
were virtually sanctioned by the au
[ thorlties. who did absolutely nothing to
| suppress the disturbances, they will be
' passed over as a "regrettable incident."

as much deliberation as if he were
lengraged in target practice. None of
his shots were wasted. Thirty- three
men fell before he went down himself.
â¢If there had been more In the "house

have been sieved. But with that gal
lant defender kitted the infuriated
orowd was free to wreak its ven
geance. Petroleum, which as every
body knows is the great product of
Baku, supplied them with the means.
A barr ! of It was roiled against the

of whom were women and children,
perished in the house.
And this was only- one incident of
thÂ» massacre. In other parts af the
.city scenes just as ruthless and ter
rible were enacted, and the military
and. police raised not a tinker to fetop
ihom. For three days the ! murdering 1
and Sundering went on unchecked.
It is' this that lends ' confirmation to
â¢the rumor current in Baku that for a
month or more the authorities had
J>ep;i seeking a pretext for setting the
Mohammedan element of the popula
tion against the Armenians with a
view to diverting a great socialist ris
ing that had been expected.
BEGINS WITH AUREST.
The trouble began with the arrest
of a certain Tartar of high position.
t In. retaliation an Armenian was as
passinnted. While his murderer wa.B
being escorted to prison by two Ar
menlans he attempted to. escape and
t v.rs shot. The Tartars then killed
the two Armenians whose bullets had
Cheated the gallows of a victim. After
. that, "as one correspondent describes
I it. "Hell broke loose." That was on
8 Sunday and the fiendish work went
on night and day until Wednesday
afternoon, when, a* though by a. pre
oom-erted agreement, the firing sud
denly ceased and the Tartars all over
the town broke out into loud cheering.
Their blood lust had been satisfied.
. The <>â ! producers and refiners of
lisku have petitioned the Government
ifor the immediate appointment of a
judicial committee of inquiry, the par
ticipating members of which â¢ shall
.consist of members of the Baku Mu
â¢nkipal Council, the Association of oil
Producers and Refiners and represen
tatives of the press. Such an investi
gation would yield something more
\X\hi\ a coat of whitewash. For that
reason it is not expected that the re
oupst will be granted. The Russian
Government prefers to do its. own
investigating in its own peculiar way.

CHICAGO, April I.â Nearly a half
miliion babies, it is said, died in the
United States last year from the ef
fÂ« cts of adulterated infant foods, poi-
NM used in coloring butter and candy,
formaldehyde in milk and other impure
articiep of diet made by fraudulent
manufacturers.
Data to prove this assertion was pro
duced neforr a meeting of the execu

tion of State Dairy and Food Depart
ments, which net to-day in this city.
The assertion of the enormous fatal
ity among infants last year resulting
from irormre food was made by J. H.
Hurly. secretary of the Indiana State
Board of Health. Hurly produced fig
ure? to show that 60 per cent of the
t->tal deaths of infants in America last
year were due to x>oisons administered
in impure foods and deadly concoctions
placed on the market hy fraudulent
f.-<>d manufacturers. He produced sta
tistics to show that more than 700,000
infants died in ihe I'nited States last
year.
"If Mr. Hurlys figures are correct."
aaid Mr. Pierce, "and I believe that
they are, an army of 455,000 infants
wa^ murdered last year by food adul

fant foods and dyrs and chemicals con
tained in the diet their mothers have
fed th**m in an effort to appease their
appetites, to satisfy their natural de
sirÂ» for nourishment and to rear them
healthfully to maturity.
"When such conditions are harrassing

adulterators are permitted to blight our
homes, feeding on the lives of our chil
dren to fatten their purses, is it not
time that pure food worker? regarded
some other subject as of greater import

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, APRIL 2, 1905.
POLES HATE
GOVERNOR
GENERAL.
Continued From Page 29, Column 6.
Ed, but the visitor left the palace very
hastily. . I
General TschertkofE was appointed
Governor General of Warsaw in 1900.
It is said that when offend the po
sition, he told his Majesty that he
feared he was too old (he was then 71),
but the Czar replied that made no dif
ference, he need do nothing, his sub
ordinates would do all the work.
General Tschertkcrff took the position,
and inspired by an intense hatred of
the Poles, entered upon his new duties
with great zest, in spite of his ad
vanced age. He has missed no oppor
tunity of displaying his animosity to
Poland and everything connected there
with. The always obnoxious press cen
sc-rship has become doubly severe un
der his rule. The Catholic clergy has
been persecuted to the last degree, and
he has thwarted every attempt of the
Poles to obtain any concessions from
the imperial Government at St. Peters
burg. Evsn the Russians detest him,
and his departure from Warsaw, which
is expected to take place within the
next month, will be the occasion of
much private rejoicing.
When In his prime General Tschert
keff was a handsome man of dignified
presence, but his age and Infirmities
render him now a somewhat pitiable
figure.
UNPOPULAR YON NOLKEN.
If General Tschertkoff is the most
hated man in all Poland, then Baron
Carl yon Nolken, chief of the Warsaw
police, who was recently injured by a
>bomb. can claim the same distinction
as regards the ancient capital of Po
land. And this is no libel on the chief,
as he has frankly admitted that he
knows that he is hated. He has no easy
task to maintain public order in a city
of 80ti,000 people, nearly all of whom
may be regarded as a hostile popula
tion. And the police force is ridicu
lously inadequate to cope with the sit
uation. Its full strength is barely I'OOO
men and Warsaw has over 4000 known
criminals and thugs of the most des
perate class. Four 'hooligans" to every
policeman, and all armed with revol
vers infinitely superior to the police
patterns warranted not to hit at ten
paces.
There is an interesting and typically
RussLun story now being told in War
saw about these revolvers. During the
disturbance in January the police
found them perfectly useless, and re
ported that a bullet fired from them
; wouldn't penetrate the skin of a per-
I son three paces away. Orders were,
i therefore, given for new revolvers to
be purchased, and the commission was
! intrusted to a dashing cavalry colonel
"t aristocratic lineage and one uf tho
; foremost figures in" Warsaw official so
! ciety. The colonel bought the revol
j vers at 12 rubles ($6) each and, they
were handed out to the men. But they
speedily proved to be of less Service
i than the discarded cmefi. An investiga
! tion was made and it was found that
! the aristocratic colonel had bought 1000
of them at 3 rubles ($1 50) each and
charged the city 12 rubles ($6), pock
eting 9 rubles ($4 50) on each gun for

Baro-n yon Nolken is an ex-army offi
cer and passed through the general
staff academy. He is said to be the first
officer having this distinction who has
entered the police service. But the
Baron enjoys living well, and he prob
ably saw that there was a better op
portunity of gratifying his desires in
this direction in the police service than
in following a military career. He wÂ£nt
to "Warsaw from St. Petersburg a year
ago, whtre he was one of the police
chiefs, and had command of the mount
ed division. In Warsaw he receives a
salary of 9000 rubles ($4500) and has a
handsome suite of apartments in the
City Hall, carriages, horses, servants
I and all kinds of extra allowances. He
I has also a large secret service fund at
i his disposal, regarding the expenditure
of which no questions are asked.
The chief lives in grand style and is
said to spend at least three times his
official salary. There are many ways
in which a Russian chief of police can
add to his Income, and report says that
a certain Jewish resident in Warsaw,
who is looked on as a sort of interme
diary of the Baron, knows most if not
all of them.
Baron yon Nolken is a handsome man
In the prime of life, with very courtly
manners, which he probably acquired
during some time spent in the consu
lar and diplomatic service. When in
full uniform his breast is covered with
an array of orders and decorations,
Russian and foreign, which few Rus

GREENE HELPS
CASTRO'S FOES
Ppe.cial Dispatch to The Call
CALL BUREAU, POST BUILDING,
WASHINGTON, April I.â Charges that
General Francia V. Greene, as one of
the officers of the asphalt trust, drew a
draft for $100,000 for the support of the
Matoa revolution against President
Castro, and that the New York and
Bermudez Company entered Into an al
liance with the revolutionists, are em
braced in a decision of the Federal Dis
trict Court of Venezuela, rendered on
March 14.
Thia decision was in denial of the
motion made by the New York and
Bermudez Company for the dismissal of
the action of the court to compel the
company to pay damages to Venezuela
for having aided the revolution.
General Greene in an interview with
Secretary Hay and in affidavits by him
sflf and others have refuted these
charges to the State Department.
CARACAS. Venezuela. April I.âFran
cisco Arroya Parejo, Attorney General
of Venezuela, to-day outlined the
grounds taken by the Supreme Court
in its decision to annul the French Ca-
ble Company's contract.
"The company contracted to construct
a submarine cable between La Guayra
and the United States, but It built a
land line over Santo Domingo, and re
peated Dominican revolutions inter
rupted it. causing loss to Venezuelan
commerce. The company also contract
ed to construct national coastwise ca
bles, but made the line international
from Porto Cabello to Coro by touch
ing the Dutch island of Curacao."
Of the New York and Bermudez As
phalt Company case the Attorney Gen
eral said:
"Venezuela has not confiscated the
New York and Bermudez Company's
property. It is provisionally In charge
of a receiver, who is responsible to the
court and who makes a monthly finan
cial report to the court. The receiver,
and not the Government, holds the
property In trust. When the receiver
ship ends a full accounting will be
made."

OIL KING'S GOLD
Special Dispatch to ThÂ« CÂ»IL
BOSTON. April 1. â The committee
of five appointed by the protesting
clergymen to ascertain the sentiment
of Congregationalists throughout the
country as to the propriety of accept
ing the $100,000 Rockefeller gift to
the American board, has begun the
preparation of a pamphlet which will
be sent out as soon as possible. The
prudential committee will have a
chance to co-operate in setting the two
sides of the question before the public.
Rev. Daniel Evans of Cambridge, who
is leading the protestants is securing
the names of all who are In sympathy
With the committee.
It is generally believed that the
money sent to the colleges in the Far
E&ct will not be recalled, and, as au
thorization has been sent for the draw-
Ing of $60,000 more from the $100,000,
there is but a small amount left un
assigned.
A prominent member of the church
has suggested that 1000 CongTega
tlonallsts pledge themselves to give
$100 each to make up the $100,000,
- which may be passed over to the
American board to be returned to
Rockefeller. It is argued that this ac
tion would remove the embarrassment
under which the prudential committee
is now laboring: and would clear the
board of the odium which the protest
ants say the acceptance of the money
has brought upon the entire Congrega
tional church.
HELPFUL AS A TOXIC.
Portland Itabbi Gives His Views on
the Rockefeller Gift Controversy.
COLUMBUS, Ohio, April I.â Dr.
Washington Gladden to-day again vig
orously answered H. H. Rogers, vice
president of the Standard Oil Company,
regarding the gift of John D. Rockefel
ler. Dr. Gladden said:
"Mr. Rogers says that I would not
trust the ten commandments for ten
days with the deacons of my church,
because they would surely break some
of them and bend others. I surely
. would not. I hope that these command
ments are In stronger power than the
deacons of any church â a power in
which they will not be twisted for the
benefit of Mr. Rogers or any one else.
"Mr. Rogers says that under Mr. Lin
coln's emancipation proclamation slav
ery was legal in certain sections. But
lt was just as much an abomination
and a curse in those regions as in the
regions where It was' abolished. Mr.
Lincoln did not touch it there because
he had no power. The rebates of the
Standard OH Company were Just as
outrageous before the law was passed
forbidding them as they were after
ward, and the method by which under
the law the Standard Oil Company is
now operating and oppressing its com
petitors are just as wrongful as were
the rebates.
"The position that wrong doing Is to
be condoned so long as it is done under
cover of laws or by evasion of the law
is one that Christian ministers or mis
sionary societies ought not to take."
THE SAN FRASTCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, APRIL. 2, 1905.
GERMANY'S
CHALLENGE
TO FRANCE
No Boom for Doubt as to
the Kaiser's Meaning in
His Speech to His Sub
jects in Moorish Capital
BERLIN. April I.â The representa
tive of the Vossiche Zeitung at Tan
gier, under yesterday's date, gives an
other version of Emperor William's ut
terances there. He says the Emperor,
replying to the address of the members
of the German colony, said: *
"In an independent country such as
Morocco, commerce must be free. I
will do my best to maintain its polit
ical and economic equity. There is no
predominating influence here. "
The Emperor's significant words
have produced a lively Impression here.
The Lokal Anzeiger, .In a dispatch
from Tangier, says that, In replying to
the members of the German colony,
Emperor William said he was glad to
make < the acquaintance of j the pioneers
of Germany in Morocco and to tell them
that they had; done their. duty under
the Emperor's protection. Germany
had great commercial interests in Mo
rocco; her ' trade was advancing grat-
Ifyingly. He (the Emperor) would make
it , his business to promote ; this ; trade, .
which was possible only on the as
gumption. of the equality of all the
powers; the sovereignty of the Sultan
and the Independence of the land. v His
visit was a recognition . of this inde
pendence. ." , v : ,.' :
The speech, the Lokal ; Anzeiger adds,
created an immense impression in the
foreign colony at Tangier, and espe
cially among the natives, [ who now re
fer to , the Emperor, as the protector of 1
the - independence â¢ of / Morocco. â  .
Great political significance, it is fur
ther asserted. Is attached to the fact
that the German Charge d' Affaires ac
companied the German Emperor to
Gibraltar.
DEMANDS THE "OPEN DOOR."
The Berlin side of the Moroccan
controversy is founded on a treaty, of
which article I reads:
"Continuing and unchanging friend
â hip shall exist between his Majesty,
the German Emperor, and his Majesty,
the Sultan of Morocco; also between
their empires and their subjects. Be
tween both empires shall the present
freedom of trade continue and for this
purpose each of the high contracting
parties bonds Itself to give and to se
cure to the subjects of the other all
rights or privileges now or in the fu
ture held by the most favored nation."
Germany declines altogether to rec
oginze France as having any more
dominant position in Morocco than
Germany.
The German Embassador to the
United States, Baron Speck yon Stern
burg, on instructions from the Foreign
Office, has notified the State Depart- I
ment in Washinjfton that Germany I
stands for the open door in Morocco.
KAISER'S COURSE A SURPRISE,
PARIS. April l.â Germany's advent
In the Mediterranean, as' shown by
Emperor William's visit to Morocco
and Chancellor yon Bulow's speech,
is the absorbing question of the day.
Heretofore France has dealt with Ger
many on the north, but now for the
first time Germany makes her appear
ance in the south and asserts that she
has strong interests in the territory
bordering on the Mediterranean. The
Latin rationsâ ltaly, Spain and France
âhave thus far considered the Med
iterranean as their special sphere of
activity, although Great Britain's con
trol of the two gateways, Gibraltar and
Suez, gives her a commanding position
in the Mediterranean.

Naturally, therefore. Germany's ap
pearance on this exclusive field is as
unexpected as her appearance at Kiao
chou, China, as a factor in the Chinese
territorial question. The fact that Ger
many has not a coast line on the Med
iterranean, while the Latin nations
have extensive coast lines, lends addi
tioual significance to Germany's enter
ing the Mediterranean sphere.
FRANCE LOOKS TO AMERICA.
The officials here continue to view the
stiuation calmly. They are especially
desirous- of having other nations, par
ticularly the United States, take a sym
pathetic view of France's policy and
purposes in Morocco. This leads to ex
pressions of much satisfaction In the
course of the United States some
months ago. which indirectly recog
nized France's paramount position in
Morocco. This occurred during the
Perdicaris case, when the United States
sought the good offices of France. The
American action in thus turning to
France was widely commented on at
the time as constituting an American
indorsement of the Anglo-French
agreement. Later the thanks of Presi
dent Roosevelt were conveyed to the
French Government for its good offices
with Morocco.
WASHINGTON. Ar-ril I.â lt is de
clared at the State Department that
there has been no exchange between
Germany and America respecting the
maintenance of the open-door In Moroc
co. When the department was endeav
oring to secure the release of Perdicaris
it availed itself with gratitude of the
good offices of the French representa
tives, and this fact was construed by
some of the French newspapers into a
quasi-recognition by America of the
predominance of French influence in
Morocco, though really the Govern
ment never has committed itself in that
matter, and there has been no occasion
for a declaration.

HEAD OF BRITISH
NAVY IS NOT AN
EXPERT SAILOR
TITLED ENGLISHMAN WHO HAS
tBhJJX APPOINTED FIRST LORD
OP" THE ADMIRALTY.
Sr*Â«ial Dl.=:>atch to The Call
- LONDON, April 1. â The appoint
ment has just been made of Earl Caw
. dor as First Lord of the Admiralty to
â "Bueceed Lord Selborne. It may not be
strictly true that his lordship has
Mifver been to sea. but certain it Is that
â¢ toe has no expert knowledge about
tnen-.of-war or ships of any sort. He
Â« a land-lubber, pure and simple. But
;'he is really an excellent business man,
and. it seems to be generally conceded
that that is the moat essential quall
jScation for th" running of a big gov
ernmental department. As chairman
of the Great Western Railway for the
last ten years he has demonstrated
; that a. man -with a title need not of
. necessity be a merely ornamental fig
' urehead. The present flourishing- con
dition of that once ill-starred company
. is attributed in no small degree to the
â¢ intelligence, energy and industry he
"brought to bear on its management.
A Conservative in politics, he is a
Radical in his theories of administra
tion. As Viscount Emlyn. his title be
fore he succeeded to his father's es
tates, he was for eleven years a mem
â¢ ber of the House of Commons and was
then regarded as one of the most effec
tive speakers in Parliament, trenchant
. in debate and swift as an Irishman at
repartee. He lost his seat for Carmar
thenshire in 1885 in consequence of a
â  redistribution scheme which split his
constituency in two and made his par
ticular bailiwick a Liberal one. In
lE9" he contested South Manchester
without success and in 1898 tried to
get in for North Wilts at a by-election,
but was defeated by Lord Fitzmaurice.
The death of his father that year,
which made him a peer, put a ter
minus to his Parliamentary ambition
by restricting him to the House of
Lords.
RECEIVES BIG SALARY.
The billet to which he has just been
appointed gives him a place in the
Cabinet, a salary of $22,500 a year and
an official residence.. But with the
downfall of the Government imminent,
his tenure of the place cannot be a
long one. and as he has had to resign
his railway chairmanship to' accept it,
he cannot be accused of taking the job
for what he ill make out of it. ; It
may be assumed that he will allow
Admiral Sir John Fisher, the First Sea
â¢Lord, the same free hand as did fflrs
predecessor, for the country, will not
tolerate any meddling with "Jackie"
In the matter of getting the navy into
.the best possible shape.
KThe "Earl is under no necessity of
working for a living. He owns exten
sive estates in Pembroke. Carmarthen,
Nairn and Inverness. The family name
is Campbell. It is an offshoot of that
famous Scottish house, the Campbells
of Argyll. A younger "son of Archi
bald, the second Earl of Argyll, mar
ried in 1510 the heiress of John Calder
of Calder. the representatives of the
old Thanes of Cawdor. A couple of
â¢ centuries later scions of this branch
of the family added to their broad
acres by marrying successively two
Welsh heiresses. There is Scotch,
."Welsh and English blood in the family
* and the Earl seems to have inherited
the best strains of all:

KENTUCKY'S
"BEST" FOR
PRESIDENT
Wet Gilts Await the
Coming o! Mr.
Roosevelt.
Bmcial !'.Â»i>tich to ThÂ« Call.
LOIISVILLK. Ky.. April 1. â If
President Roosevelt umiprtak^s to ac
cept all tht- whisky that is being put
up in red. white anl blue wrappers for
him he will hÂ«.ve enough of Kentm -ky's
favorite product to treat every mem
ber of Congress, diplomat and Min
ister in Washinpton. Postmaster Ba-
ker and United .States Marshal James
have received a caee each, with in-
structions to present W to the Presi-
dent, and many distillers are said to
be making plans to place samples of
their product in the president's hands.
Secret Service AgÂ°nt Bowen of the
Cincinnati division and several of his
staff arrived in Louisville to-day to re
main until after President Roosevelfs
visit next Tuesday. This afternoon
they made a careful inspection of the
route of the parade and they will
watch it closely from now until the
pageant shall have passed. Several Â«d
ditiorml secret service men will come
here from Washington to-morrow
r.:Â£ht or Monday.
of his family seats. It is famous,
everybody remembers, by the
tradition, immortalized hy Shakes
peare in "Macbeth" that there Dun
oan. King (if S-otland. wa* murdered
by the Thane of Cawdor. The alleged
aim>>r "f King Duncan is one of the
curiosities of the place, which is freely
shown to visitors. Another is * haw
thorn tree growing out of the rooky
of the lowest dungeon or vault
of the great tower, while near it stands
an enormous chest of great antiquity.
The legend of the origin of the cas
tle is that a Thane of Cawdor was di
rected to load an ass with the gold
with which he intended to build his
fortress. The donkey, being heavily
burdened, lay down for rest by the
hawthorn tree, and the Thane built his
square tower about rt. From this
small beginning rose the great castle
of Cawdor, and the thorn and chest
in the dungeon are still declared to
be the originals. Around this tree the
Cawdor toast. "Freshness to the haw
thorn and prosperity to the line of
Cawdor." is still drunk by the family
and its retainers once a year.
OF HISTORIC IXTKREST.
Judging by the size of the chest the
founder of the house must have struck
it rich somewhere before he started
out to build him a domicile where he
could retain securely to what he had
, got. And to have transported such a
load the donkey must have been a
; far stronger beast than those employed
by the London coster in these days.
Whether the story be true or no, Caw
dor Castle is rich in historic associa
tions, which will stand the closest
scrutiny. Lord Lovat was sheltered
there after the slaughter of Culloden,
and the room is still shown in which
he rested. The grand old edifice,
moated, with drawbridge, massive de
fensive tower and turrets, stands
square to the winds Just as it did in
feudal day? when â  business was re
garded as degrading and plundering
honorable.
Lacking four years of the age at
which, according to Dr. Osier a man
should be chloroformed. Earl Cawdor
is far from regarding himself as nearly
played out. Wei! preserved and of
active habits, he can buckle down to
work in a fashion which causes dismay
among the aristocratic understrappers
of the Admiralty. In him the family
toast has been well fulfilled. He is the
father of six sons and tpur daughters.
His charming wife, the belle of the
season when he married her in 1868,
is still accounted one of the handsom
est of British peeresses. She shows
herself to be as plainly out of touch
with the modern life of smart society
as her husband is with the favorite
diversion of titled idlers.

TRADE ACTIVITY
AT HIGH LEVEL
â¢ â -
NEW YORK, April 1. â The weekly
bank statement to-day confounded all
previous estimates as to its character.
Notwithstanding the week's ensrmoas
demands for credits the banks report a
contraction in loans of upward of
$10,000,000. The only explanation
can be that the credits kept outstand
ing in the stock market by the banks
have been withdrawn to meet re
quirements in other directions and that
loans have been made through trust
companies and through other sources.
There is no room to doubt that the
volume of credits as a whole has been
substantially expanded during the
week. The indicated loss of cash ot
$4,000,000 is reduced in the showing of
the bank statement to about $800,000.
The net result is an improvement In
the margin of the surplus to the ex
tent of $2,185,250.
The appearance of the statement
had an encouraging effect on the de
mand for stocks, but the day's notable
movements were confined to the list
of specialties. The day's operations
were almost wholly in professional
hands, but were indicative of a con
fident feeling that next week will see
\ a revival of speculative demand and a
quick relxation in the money market.
; Banking opinion on this pdint waa
by no means agreed in spite of the
I nominal strength of the bank state*
! ment.
Prices of stocks have given ground
this week, but In an irregular and re
strained manner, the decline being in-
I terrupted by recurrent rallies. This
; was believed to be due to the frequent
; covering of short contracts by the bear
' traders, who thus testified their lack
!of confidence in their position. The
developments of the week have of
fered nothing to suggest any impair
ment of actual values. Trade and in
dustry are obviously expanding still.
But with money market resources re
stricted, means for free operations in
stocks have been lacking and the rate
of activity in securities has decreased
materially.
Each day during the week there was
fear that a flurry would occur in the
money market before the day was over.
The tendency toward recovery in the
latter part of each day on the Stock
Exchange marked the sense of relief at
the tranquillity of the money mrakeL
The subscription to the $75,000,000 in
stallment of the Japanese loan was the
principal event in the money market.
The high level of trade activity and
the unprecedented volume of bank
clearings promise no abatement in the
seasonable demands of the interior for
money. In spite of the apparently in
vincible ease of the New York money
market up to this time, the considera
tion of this project enjoins a degree of
caution in the extension of credits.
Railroad net earnings for February
make a poor comparision with last
year, but the later growth of traffic
shown by gross earnings reports throws
the earlier showing out of considera
tion. Peace prospects have been a vary
ing influence during the week.
The bond market Is quiet and the
price level is relatively lower than that
of stocks to a degree that occasions
n>ueh comment. United States old 4's
and 3's advanced %, the new 4's coupon
\ and the new 4's registered % per

George Whlttell, as trustee of the
Mary Dempsey trust fund of $40,000,
has filed a petition asking that the
court settle his final account, distrib

1900 and that the earnings in the
fourteen years and seven months that
have passed since then have amounted
to $35,000. In addition to one-half
of this fund to which he is entitled
as heir. Whittell asks the court M

There are nearly 4000 centenarians in thÂ« United States. The lest census shows that in the United States, with a population of 76,000,000, there are 1289'

HOW TO LIVE TO BE ONE HUNDRED
Quite a large number of these old people were^recently interviewed and asked as to what they especially attributed their great age. In nearly every case
the answer was hard work, freedom from worry, careful living, fresh air and Duffy's Pure Malt Whiskey, taken regularly according to directions. Duffy's, is an

SANTA FE WILL
BUILD NEW ROAD
Special Dispatch to TbÂ» Call.
DENVER, April I.â Colonel Ed-ward
F. Brown, a prominent citizen of Colo
rado and a wealthy mining man, has
made a report to the Santa Fe Com
pany on the feasibility of building a
branch road into the Goldfield district.
An excellent authority has stated
that there is every reason to believe
the Santa Fe will construct a line
from Ivanpah, San Bernardino County,
Cal., to Goldfield, Nev. The district has
been carefully surveyed and a feasible
route mapped out. Officials of the road
now have the question under considera
tion, and It is generally believed in rail
road circles that the proposed line will
be constructed.
Colonel Brown has made a careful in
vestigation of a route between the
points named, and has paid particular
attention to the possibilities for busi
ness along the route examined. He re
turned from the territory a few days
ago and submitted a map and report
to the officials of the Santa Fe. He has
returned to California, presumably
upon some business connected with the .
project.
Colonel Brown has the reputation of
being a careful, conservative man. His
report Is understood to set forth a per
fectly feasible route for the Santa Fe
from Ivanpah to Goldfield, passing
through Lida and Bullfrog and taking
In all the mines of any consequence yet
opened. His map is said to be replete
with details, showing all the important
mines between the two points men
tioned, including borax deposits which
Hre being exploited, as well as the big
gold and silver properties which are in
the pubic eye.
The great need of the Goldfield dis
trict at the present time is railroad
communication with the outside world.
Particularly is this the case with Lida
and Bullfrog, newer mining camps than
either Tonopah or Poldfield, hut which
are said to be no less important.

arrangements are already made to
have thousands of Norwegian families

"H. L. TO TESSIE"
"Keep Your Mouth, Shut
and "Keep Him Away From
New York" Is Writer's Plea
by Mail and Telegraph
CINCINNATI, Ohio, April 1. â A
fight for the possession of certain let
ters which were intrusted to Detec
tive Akin by Mrs. J. Morgan Smith
when her husband was arrested is
promised as the next development in
the "Nan" Patterson case, so far as
the Cincinnati connection with the
case Is concerned. Attorney Shay to
day demanded the return of the let
ters from the detective, and, when the
officer refused, the attorney announced
that he would take the matter into
the courts on Monday and compel the
delivery of the letters, threatening to
cause the detective's arrest. Akin re
fused to take any action until Monday.
Akin said that when he was appeal
ed to by Mrs. Smith regarding the let
ters he supposed they were of minor
importance and entirely unconnected
with the case and therefore he had
promised to care for them. After they
had been turned ovW: to him, he said,
Mrs. Smith declared:
"If these papers ever get Into the
hands of the police they will hang
Nan."
This remark caused him to change
his intention 'nd he has turned them
over to the local police for safe
keeping until the papers can be de
livered to District Attorney Jerome.
The contents of most cf the letters
have not been made public, but at
least four are said to be very import
ant. Among them is a letter from "H.
L.," who telegraphed to Smith on the
day of his arrest, saying:
"Keep your mouth shut. New York
will attend to your case."
This "H. L." letter is addressed to
"Tessie," which, Akin says, is one of
the names assumed by Mrs. Smith in
her wanderings since last August,

cent of Participation In Attempt
to Raise Boodle Fund.
LINCOLN, Neb., April 1. â The com
mittee of the State Senate appointed to
investigate the alleged attempt to raise
a $5000 boodle fund with which to se
cure the passage of the biennial elec
tion bill, extending the tenure of county
and State officials one year, to-day
made a report, finding" that no member
of the Senate had been directly or In
directly connected with the alleged at
tempt at bribery.
The report says, howerer, that the
evidence shows that an attempt was
made by a number of county officials to
raise a fund to be used in lobbying the
bill thiough the Senate, which attempt
"originated in the city of Omaha and is
traceable to some couaty official of
Douglas County, or probably to Treas
urer Fink and bis employe, J. H. Win

HIGH SCHOOLS
GET ATTENTION
In accordance with the provisions of
the State law and pursuant to a com
munication on the subject sent by Su
perintendent of Public Instruction
Kirk, the Board of Education organized
itself yesterday into a High School
Board of Education for the purpose of
conducting the high schools of San
Francisco.- This action was taken by
the School Directors because the law
provides that the State school funds
must be kepi separate from the city
and county Echool funds, and nearly all
the money for the support of the high
Rchno!? comes from the State. The
High School Board was organized by
the election of Alfred Roncovleri as
piesident and Emmet P. Barrett as
cl^rk. The first business of the new
board the adoption of the budget,
containing a statement of the amount
cf city and county funds which will be
required during the fiscal year ending
June 30, 1906. for the purpose of meet-
Ing all the expenditures necessary for
Pthe maintenance of the high schools of
this city and county, as follows
For salaries, wages, supplementary
books, machinery, supplies for the
drawing departments, apparatus and
general supplies, $229,365 76; for repairs,
y 533.561; total, $263,226 76.
The rules fOF the conduct of the hijjh
leehools were adorned, and the commit
tees for the primary and grammar
schools were appointed. The last Thurs
day in each month was designated as
the meeting time of the High School
Board. The higrh school budget, togeth
er with the budget of the primary and
schools, will be submitted to
ird if Supervisors to-morrow.

FISK SUSPENDS
COX'S HELPER
Postmaster Arthur G. Fisk yesterday
suspended W. G. Morrison, assistant
superintendent of city delivery under
Superintendent A. M. Cox at the gen
eral postoffice. Morrison is said to have
been irregular in his duties of late, and
after hearing complaints from several
of the clerks Fisk decided to suspend
him pending developments.
Stories of Morrison's irregularities
and his alleged mistreatment of the
clerks under him have been coming to
Fisk for several weeks.
Morrison has been in the Postoffice
Department for yiany years and was
always regarded as a conscientious of
ficial. In January, 1904, he was pro
moted to the position of assistant su
perintendent of city delivery, at a sal
ary of $2700 a year.
A NFAV PROMISING TERRITORY
OPENED UP IN THE GOLD
FIKIvD DISTRICT.
Wliat was supposed to bo worthless
ground in Goldfleld may prove to be the,
richest and best, not unlike Cripple
Creek, where Stratton struck the Groat
Independence and took out millions from
ground every one laughed at.
Several new strikes have been made in
the southern part of the Goldneld dis
trict, Nevada, and among: them, and one
of the best, is by the Goldfleld Gold Dust
Mining Company, a company, owned
largely by: local people. In consequence
of the strike many prospectors are now
prospecting: the Immediate vicinities. The
company has eight full claims, compris
ing a hundred and sixty acres. The char
acter of the country is very similar to
the best parts of the Cripple Creek, be
ing a mailapai capping, the result of a
lava flow. In several places the capping
has been eroded, exposing a bedrock, of
decomposed andesite, while a little far
ther south : begins a' strong lime country
rock, being a dolomite, not unlike the
formation around the Grand Central
mine, Utah. The strike on the Goldfteld
Gold Dust was made at fifty feet from
the surface" in ' a volcanic ash sort of
stuff, resembling the gold deposits of the
Transvaal districts, ; South Africa. A
well denned deposit of this soft decom
posed quartz and ash occurs in the ande
site. and the face of a short drift at the
fifty-foot level goes ' high in i free '-â  gold,
giving as high <as $205 00 per ton. A
well-known member .of ; one .of the local
stock exchanges â â  took an average sam
ple and received ; the phenomenal value
of $48 00 across the face ' of the drift.
"With the facilities of the mill, now about
completed in - Goldfleld, s this value ore
could be treated at a handsome : profit.
One. hundred extra feet of i, work is now
In course of completion : and additional
values and ore. will undoubtedly be open
ed up. Other, claims in the ; immediate
surroundings are being sold almost daily
to mining men : who have Investigated,

MRS. C. WATSON
TAKES THE CUP
The California Club and the park
courts were crowded all day yesterday
with tennis players who are practicing
for the coming tournaments. Two tour
nament matches were played at the
park and one at the California Club.
The ladies' handicap singles tourna
ment, which has been in progress on
the park courts all week, was com
pleted.
The competition was for a three-time
silver loving cup presented by Major
Van Vliet. To Mrs. C. Watson belongs
the distinction of having her name first
on the new trophy. Playing from
scratch, she distanced all competitors
and carried off the honors. In the finals
she met Miss Sarita Van Vliet. The
latter was called upon to give rather
large odds. She "owed 15 2-6" each
game and at that almost beat her op
ponent. The score in Mrs. Watson's
favor was 6-1, 2-6. 7-5.
The third set was a particularly close
and an interesting one. Of the first
two sets each player won one. easily.
The real struggle came in the decid
ing set. Miss Van Vliet tried her best
io win, but with the odds allowed her
Mrs. Watson proved a trifle too strong.
The semi-final match, played in the
morning, was a one-sided affair. Miss
Van Vliet allowed Miss B. Cully owe
odds of 15 3-6 and won by a score of
6-1, 6-3.
The last qualifying match for the in
door tournaments was p!ayed on the
California Club courts late in the aft
ernoon. The contestants were Harry
Rolfe and Herbert Schmidt. The for- j
nier, by virtue of his victory over
Schmidt, earned the right to meet
Carl Gardner in the semi-finals at Me
chanics' Pnvilion. The match was an !
interesting one, and was thoroughly
enjoyed by a few spectators. Rolfe won
the first set, 8-3. The second went to j
Schmidt by a similar score. The lat- !
ter seemed to have struck his gait, !
and it seemed he would win. He won
the first game of the third set, but :
Rolfe steadied down and took the next :
six games and the match. The score I
was fi-4. 6-3. 6-1.
Many interesting matche* were play
ed in practice, some of which resulted
as follows:
Harry Sullivan beat Judge Kerrigan,
6-?., 7-5, 6-4: Sullivan and B. Ivanco
vich beat Judge Kerrigan and W. Mur
phy, 7-5, 7-5; W. S. MacGavln beat Dr. j
Younger, 6-3, â¬-1; Grant Smith beat I
Albert Kenyon, 6-4, 10-8; H. Gabriel i

GETTING READY
FOR CITY FIGHT
Citizens who are ready to lend their
energies to the cause of good govern
ment for San Francisco may be inter
ested in knowing that Ruef and his fol
lowers are busy in the work of rein
forcing the Schmitz Central Club. Thib
club descended to the lowest degree of
political depravity In the municipal
campaign of 1903. It is still a mystery
where all the money that the club so
lavishly expended to defeat Henry J.
Crocker came from, but the coin was
freely used to create and stimulate en
thusiasm for Mayor Schmitz's candi
dacy. Under the direction of Ruef, who
is a surely a clever strategist, the club
wan used to pack the Lane mass-meet
ing at the Mechanics' Pavilion and cre
ate the Impression among merchants
and business men generally that the
people were rallying to the standard
of the Democratic nominee. The bait
which Ruef threw out was quickly
grabbed by the gullible. One of the
newspapers was fooled into the predic
tion that Lane would be elected, yet at
the same time It was? obvious to intelli
gent observers of the contest that he
could not carry any one of the eighteen
Assembly districts of the city. In the
coming municipal contest the boss of
the Schmitz regime, assisted by Herrin
and Lynch, will probably introduce new
schemes for dividing the forces of good
citizenship, and may succeed In fooling
Rome of the voters again.
Ruef's present intention is to use the

Schmitz Central Club to capture the
delegates to the Republican nominating
convention. The word has been passed
along the line for janitors and attaches
generally of the Schmitz administra
tion to join the club. Each applicant
for membership is expected to state in
bis application whether he holds a po
sition under the city government, and
if holding office he must state what po
sition he holds and what pay he re
ceives. Every office-holding member of
the club will be compelled to pay a por
tion of his salary to the campaign fund.
Ruef in his fight to perpetuate the
Schmitz regime counts on the support
of the police force, the Board of
Works, the Election Commission and
the Health Department. He also counts
on the under-coyer support of the
Southern Pacific, the internal revenue
office and the postoffice. The Republi
can County Committee would not ac
cept a programme presented by Ruef,
Herrin, Lynch and Fisk.
The Postmaster is not classed as an
ardent supporter of Ruef and would
probably get in line against the
Sehrnitz administration If Herrin and
Ruef were not doing politics together.
Taxpaylng citizens and other voters
who are ready to get In line for a
better order of things in the govern
ment of the city should not lose sight
of the fact that Ruef and Schmitx are
strongly intrenched. A pliant Chief
of Police would add to their strength
in a battle at the^jrimary polls. For
several weeks negotiations have been
in progress between representatives of
the Mayor and a labor leader, who
ardently supported Crocker in the last
municipal campaign. Schmitz is ex
tremely anxious to restore harmony in
the Union Labor party. The labor
leader whose support the Mayor is
so anxious to gain is a friend and ad
viser of Treasurer McDougald.
Ruef Is not at all confident of hlÂ«
ability to capture the Republican
nominating convention. If he cannot
secure the Republican nomination for
Schmitz he will endeavor to nominate
for Mayor a man who will qgr*Â»-
the Commissioners appointed by
S'-hmlte shall be permitted ti> s^rvt

Clerks. secretaries, janitors and
attaches of the municipal go
ment can be directed to serve as

j There seems to be a growing de
termination on the part of the Re
publican citizens to elect men of
firmness and character to thÂ«Â» :â 
nating convention of th* party,
eral important conferences hayÂ«
recently held. It Is said that F. W.
Dohrmann. Judge Slack. Fairfnx
Whelan, Richard J. "Welch, John D.
Daly, George D. Clark and many other
well-known citizens are Identified with
the movement. There are indications
that Ruef. Schmitz and Herrin will
be opposed in every Assembly District
of the city. In Ruefs own district,
the Forty-fifth, the supporters of hon
est local government will put up a
fight keep Ruefs henchmen from

CASTNER DIES
FROM INJURIES
Sr>e<:ial Dlsratch to The Call.
REDDING. April I.â Louis Castner,
one of the twelve persons injured by
the explosion of a flashlight pistol at
Lewiston on the evening of March 18,
died this morning at his home at
French Gulch. He was 47 years of age
and leaves a wife and six children.
The accident in which Castner re
oelved his injuries occurred at the
schoolhouse at Lewiston during the
progress of a masquerade ball. Chris
Blakemore and Harvey Clayton were
taking a flashlight picture of the mask
ers, when the pistol used to touch off
the flash exploded and fragments of
the copper and brass flew, injuring
several people. One piece struck Cast
ner in the throat, severing his wind
pipe.
LITTLE TOT
SAVES LIFE
OF A BABY
Six-Year-old CMB

Staggers Out of Burning Home With

Special Dlscatch to The Call.
STOCKTON, April I.â The. home of
Jacob A. Schilling, in Fair Oaks, was
destroyed by fire this afternoon. The
6-year-old son of the owner dashed into
the blazing cottage just before the roof
fell in and saved his baby sister from
being cremated. The fire is believed to
have been started by children playing
with matches- in a closet.
Schilling was out in the country and
Mrs. Schilling and the children were at
home. When the fire was discovered it
had grained considerable headway, and
efforts to save the cottage were out of
the question. Mrs. Schilling ran out of
the house, carrying one of her younger
children with her. She then went back
and saved a few articles of Wearing
apparel. She believed that all of her
children were saved. Suddenly her 6
year-old son remembered that his baby
sister was in the house asleep in a crib.
The manly little fellow dashed back
into the amoke and flames, while his
mother looked on terrified. Soon the
little fellow staggered out of the fire
bearing the baby in his arms.
The house and all that it contained
were destroyed. Schilling had secreted
$2000 in gold in the house. It is prob
able that the most of the molten gold
may be recovered.
ASCOT SEASON
IS COMPLETED
LOS ANGELES, April 1. â There
were few April fool jokes played on
the public at Ascot to-day, the clos
ing day of the winter meeting. The
big crowd was more than fairly suc
cessful in picking winners, several of
the winning horses being backed to
their lowest price at post time. The
only real surprise was in the big race
of the day, the Jonathan Club handi
cap, which fell to Colonel Ruppert at
the good odds of 8 to 1. He was lib
erally played at this price.
The meeting just closed has been
successful in every respect. There
have been 111 days of racing and the
fields have been especially good, com
prising' in many events horses of a
high class. The attendance through
out the meeting has been large. It is
stated that the association profited
financially. Summary:

LAUGH AT
DYING MAN
Regard Drowning as
aa "April Fool"
Hoai
SzwolaJ Dtaitateh to ThÂ« Ckll.
CHICAOO. April Lâ A* cry of "April
fool" to-day brought to a fatal stop the
work of rescuing a young man -vho,
while the noonday tide of travel was at
its height, jumped into the river from
the Madteon street bridge and was
drowned.
The cry "Man overboard" brought
hundreda of would-be rescuers to the
epot, but the belief that the whole af
fair was an all fools' day joke turned
them from their purpose/ and no at
tempt was made to save the would-b*
suicide.
The identity of the young man is a
mystery. His body haa not yet been
reoovÂ»red*
Fourteen large houses in Blooms
bury, London, have been demolished
for the British Museum extension.
Even though a man retiree volun
tarily It 1p awful hard for him to like
thÂ» one â who succeeds him.

APRIL FOOLS
ARE PLENTIFUL
Gallant Captain Petersen
Rescues a Straw Dummy
From the Wheels of a Car
CITY TBEASUEY BOBBED
Baited Coin Sacks Tempt
Several City Employes
From Paths of Rectitude
San Francisco had something new
yesterdayâ an April fool's day hero.
His name is Captain Herman Petersen
of the lumber schooner Jennie Johnson,
which is a translation of Yennle Yon
son.
He wan out on Fillmore and Haight
streets last night. Just as he was about
to tack across the 6treet he saw a
prostrate figure lying on the track.
'Yun.ping yimminey, what a yag,"
muttered Herman. Â»
A Fillmore street car came careening
madly down the hill. "Ahoy!" shouted
Herman. 'Back water. Port your helm.
Man overboard!"
But the motorman had been against
the game before. The car whirled on.
Was Herman going to see a human be
ing transformed into Wienerwurst be
fore his very eyes. No, shiver his tim
bers, blast his toplightsâ him to the
rescue.
He caught the helpless victim by the
shoe, and the car caught him amid
ships. When he revived in an adjacent
corner grocery they showed him the
scarecrow he had tried to save from
disaster.
"I tank I go back to the Yennie Yon
son," said Herman. "Some one ban
yoshing me."
Among those who bit at the old hy
drant gag was Mr. Jack Johnsing. He
was asked by a small bunch of human
ity to help lift a bundle of wood near
the corner of Eighth and Market
streets.
Jack lifted. He lifted again. Then
he got down on his knees with a long
pull and a strong pull, and the hydrant
loosened, turning upon the chocolate
colored a shower bath. While
the fountain spurted "Mistah Johnsing"
chased the kid. He is chasing him yet.
Nobody around the City Hall would
take a red-hot stove, but Treasurer Mc-
Dougald found out yesterday that some
people who live under the shadow of
the bronze lady on the dome would
take almost anything else.
A coin sack filled with lead was laid
on a counter. It looked as though some
one who had been overcome by weari
ness had left it for the Janitor to sweep
out in the morning. There were lots
of people willing to save the garbage
carts the trouble of hauling tfie filthy
stuff to the crematory.
The first to fasten his optics on the
bag was an elderly gentleman of fam
ily. He slid the "coin" into his pocket
and started down the hallway. "April
fool!" shouted some one. The old fel
low dropped the sack and ran.
"I cant tell the names of the people
who tried to get the sack," said Mc-
Dougald, "but I'll tell you I was sur
prised." There were nearly a hundred
municipal employes whose eager
"mitts" clutched the bag.
It ivas a bad day all around for the
unwary. The Morgue got all sorts of
orders to call for corpses that are hard
ly due for several years. Nob Hill resi
dences were earnestly requested to call
"Cowboy Mag " to the phone, only her
saloon number being given.
Biscuits were stuffed with cotton bat
ting, candies were peppered and the
free lunches were unsafe. All sorts of
innocent viand? were doctored. The
adage that a sucker is born every min
ute was proven all day. The purse on
a string and the brick in a hat claimed
their victims regularly.

KINIRY TAKEN TO FOLSOM.
OAKLAND, April I.â After Chief of
Police Hammel and Captain Bradish
of Los Angeles made a last effort to
induce him to confess to several hold
ups in the Southern California metrop
olis. David P. Kiniry, convicted of the
murder of Policeman Smith, was taken
to Foisom prison. The Los Angeles
officials could get nothing out of him.
Kiniry is sentenced to life imprison
ment.
To Dismiss Non-Civil Service Men.
The Civil Service Commission will,
at a meeting to be held to-morrow
night, adopt a resolution calling on
the Board ot Education to dismiss all
the carpenters, painters and other
mechanics employed on the school
buildings and appoint civil service eli
gibles in their places. The action will
be in accordance with the City Attor
ney's advice that the civil service gov
erns the employment of such mechan
ics.
Because a man doesn't call you a
liar, he doesn't believe all you are tell
ing him.

ANOTHER FIRE
AT ALVARADO
OAKLAND, April I.â Half the town
of Alvarado was wiped out of existence
to-night for the second time within a
year. Eight buildings, all stores save
one, were burned to the ground, and
the structure containing the postoffice
and the office of the telephone company
was only saved by tearing down a
email building between it and the fire.
The fire started at 6 o'clock in the
second story of the building owned by
Tony Davilla, the first floor of which
is occupied as a saloon and the second
as a residence. A gasoline stove ex
ploded and set fire to the frame struc
ture. The flames spread to the old
church, now occupied by a couple of
barber shops, then to Tony Lee's resi
dence and then to the store of F. E.
Vargas, on the corner. This was quick
ly burned, and the fire rapidly licked
up the drug store of Charles Wenkle,
which had recently been remodeled and
refitted.
By this time all of Alvarado and
half of the country round about had
collected and was trying to fight the
fire. There was no fire department and
no apparatus save some garden hose.
To save the postoffice and telephone of
fice a small frame building that was
standing between the fire and the
building by these two was razed to the
| ground and the fire was checked.
The loss will run between $50,000 and
j $75,000.

THUGS FATALLY
INJURE VICTIM
RENO, Nev.. April I.â William An
derson, a ditch laborer, was set upon
by two highwaymen at Derby late last
night. The robbers, disappointed at
not getting any money from their vic
tim, began beating him on the head
with stones. His cries summoned help
and the would-be murderers escaped.
Anderson is in a critical condition and
physicians say he canot recover.
Want Writ of Prohibition.
The attorneys employed by Chan
Cheung applied to the Supreme Court
yesterday for a writ restraining Judge
Lawlor from trying their client on the
charge of murder. It is argued that
the indictment returned by the Grand
Jury was defective. The matter was
taken under consideration.
GRAPE-NUTS.
IJTITLE BOY BLUE.
His Mother Blows His Horn.
A lady living in Illinois writes about
food to a friend whose little girl has a
delicate stomach, and we are privileged
to cjuote from hÂ«Â»r letter:
"The best way to advise you in little
Bessie's case is, T feel, to tell you what
I did for my little Hoy Blue. He was,
like your daughter, very fond of white
bread, potatoes and the usual food of
the every-day table. His appetite seem-
ed good and he ate freely, but. like lit-
tle Rcss'e. he didn't seem to get the
proper amount of nourishment out of
his food, was puny in body and. lack-
inp strength, was peevish and half sick
most of the time.
"I was v?ry much worried about him,
because I couldn't find the right sort
of food for him â the ordinary breakfast
foods didn't seem to answer. At laÂ«t, a
few months aj?o, I determined to try
Grape-Nuts, i confess I was almost in
despflir. and hud but little hope that it
would prove any better than the other
prepared foods.
"Th<? rÂ«sult wÂ«s most surprising. Boy
Blue took to the Crape-Nuts food and
it did him good from the beginning. He
has gained steadily in weight, strength
and good spirits, and has taken on a
complexion like a wild rose. His eyes
fairly dance with health and happiness
â his peevishness is all gone.
"Then husband and I both began to
Â«at Grape-Nut3 food, and with the beat
of results. He finds it especially bene-
ficial as a brain food. Tou know that
one with his sedentary habits needs
something specially adapted to such
conditionsâ much nourishment in small
hulk. He flndH U in Grape-Nuts food,
and he says he does better work since
he began to eat it than ever before.
"Give your baby Grape- Nuts and I'll
guarantee the result*." Name given by
Postum Co.. Battle Creek, Mich.
There's a reason.

Wellville," in each pkg. .
OIL SUPPLANTS
COAL AS FUEL
Si>eolal Dispatch to The CWI.
TACOMA. April I.â Because Califor
nia oil is still gradually supplanting
coal as fuel for steam-producing pur
poses, less coal is being used on the Pa
cific Coast than for many years past.
This is the conclusion reached by C.
R. Claghorn, manager of the Northern
Pacific Railway coal department, after
an investigation. Claghorn came here
several months ago from the Pennsyl
vania Railroad service to take charge
of the Northern Pacific coal property,
following the appointment of former
Manager Horn as general manager of
the Northern Pacific.
Claghorn has reached the conclusion
that oil fuel has passe 3 the experi
mental stage. Its effect upon the coal
market is such that the great mines
at Roslyn are now running with small
forces and working only three or four
days a week. Claghorn believes that oil
has come to stay as the most econom
ical fuel for the lighter railroad grades
and for the many steamers plying on
Puget Sound to Alaska and up and
down the Pacific Coast.
WOMEN HOMESTEADERS
ARE WANTED AS WIVES
Land Commissioner Kellar Delnged
With letters Asking Information
Concerning Female Farmers.
BONESTEEL, S. D., April I.â
Thousands of letters from candidates
for matrimony in all parts of the
United States are coming to Land
Commissioner J. S. Kellar at Bone
steel. The writers wish information
concerning the 121 young women who
drew fine farming homesteads in the
recent opening of Government land
on the Rosebud Indian reservation.
The avalanche of letters is the re
sult of a recently published interview
in which Kellar Intimated that many
of the young women wanted husbands
to help take care of the farms.
The letters come from men of
every age and in every walk of life.
With the exception of Arizona, Maine,
New Mexico and Nevada every State
in the Union 1b represented in the in
quiries. The bulk of the letters, how
ever, came from New York, Maryland,
Connecticut and Pennsylvania.

Walter Jennings' quaint filly. Mary 1
F, winner of the Gebhard handicap
for two-year-olds decided over the
Futurity course, was the only favor
ite that did not perpetrate a joke on
the throng yesterday at Oakland
track.
For a stake event vith $2000 added
the field was an extremely moderate
. one and does not speak well for the
kindergarten division this year. Sir
Wilfred remained in his stable, leav- i
I ing only six to face the webbing. Mary i
F, allotted 106 pounds, had "Big Bill" j
Knapp for a pilot, and went to the j
post an odds-on choice. Daruma was
indulged v^th the lead to the stretch,
wYiere the favorite took charge of
; things and at the wire won pricking
â¢ her *>ars from the hard ridden '
Equorum Rex. Dr^jyma led Abe Meyer '
In four lengths for the small end of
the stake.
FAVORITES FAIL BACKERS.
There were* strings to most of the
â favorites and while the avalanche of
â winning outsjfciers may have pleased
the layers, the talent wept. Bogus
Bill, Glenrite. Hainault and Hans
Wagner were most edible morsels.
Bogus Bill, which xvas a two-year
old when the corner-stone of the old
Dostoffiee was laid, captured the open
ing mile and a sixteenth selling event
at odds of 15 to 1. Try* outsider re
ceived some straggling support and
cleverly ridden by Bell, beat Tann
iiau^ser, the favorite, more than a
length. I O U ran third.
Right on top of this came the victory
.of Glenrice. a 16 to 1 shot in tjie bet
ting, on the split of the mile and a six
teenth selling number. Rev Dare, con

HAIXALI/T AX EASY WIXXKR.
Because it -was supposed Hainault
could not travel over a fast track, the
ring laid 10 to 1 about the brown geld
ing and he came home an easy winner
oC the mile and seventy yard selling af
fair. Travels had the leg up and at
post time 6 to 1 was the market
quotation. North West, the 13 to 10
favorite, ran out all the way with
Fountain, arriving with the tail end
ers. Hainault gained the lead on the
back stretch and at the wire led Scher
zo out three open lengths. The latter
horse was almost left or he would have
been returned the winner. The show
went to Dora I.
Just to be in line. Andrew Mack, rid
den by Travers and favorite for the
mile and seventy yard handicap, fin
ished third. Hans Wagner, a well
played 102-pounder piloted by Jakie
Jones, turned the trick. The visitor
from Lo s Angeles headed Delagoa on
the far turn, and with little left at the
close disposed of Mindanao by a length.
Bombardier and Horatius showed to no
particular advantage.
<JOLD EXAMKI/S POOR SHOWING.
The taroi* showing made by Gold En
ameJ in thx- concluding mile event for
three-year-olds seems almost too ghast
ly to be true. Still it must be that the
strapping cher-tnut is a false alarm or
else is not right, for the stable connec
tions br-t on Truf Wing, the winner.
Gold Enamel ruled an even money fa
vorite and trailed Sea Air into the
stretch. In the interim Birkenrutn had
been busily engaged extricating True
Wing from a pocket. The last eighth
of the tour the latter filly waded to the
front, defeating Celeres in ragtime
fashion. McÃride dropped over to the
rail with the first choice, finishing a
weird fourth.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, APRIL 2, 1905,
WOMAN'S DEATH
IS EXPLAINED
Coroner's Jury Is Satisfied
That Polly Locke Was
Not Shot by Companion
Special Dispatch to TbÂ« Call.
BAN MATEO. April I.â The verdict
of the Coroner's jury is thÂ£t pretty
Polly Locke came to her death by sui
cide. Jefferson Stewart, who was alone
with her in a room in the rear of a sa
loon when she met her death last Tues
day night, and who was held without
bail pending the result of the inquest,
wae released at the conclusion of the
hearing.
Stewart testified that the woman
killed herself without any apparent
reason, but the supposed direction of
the bullet and the absence of powder
marks raised a suspicion of foul play.
This theory was refuted at the inquest
held by Judge Booth this evening by
the expert testimony of the autopsy
surgeon. Dr. J. L. Ross', and by Sheriff
Mansfield, who demonstrated a new
theory concerning the appearance, and
effect of gunshot wounds. They bound
together two pieces of pork six inches
thick, skin outward, and pressing the
muzzle of a 38-callber revolver, similar
to that which caused the woman's
death, tightly against the skin, dis
charged the weapon. The bullet made
a large ragged wound at the entrance,
while the exit was small and smooth,
an entire reversal of the usual effect.
No powder burn was visible on the ex
terior surface, but It showed beneath
the skin, where a large cavity was
made by the explosion. They then tes
tified that the wound was identical
with that which caused Polly Locke's
death, except that no powder marks
were found inside the wound on the
woman's neck. They account for this
by saying that the flow of blood in the
case of the woman washed away the
marks.
District Attorney Bullock was con
vinced of the suicide theory and the
Jury so found. The remains of the un
fortunate woman were buried in the
potter's field at Redwood City yester
day, as her family had discarded her.
AUTOMOBILISTS
ARE JUBILANT
Special Dispatch to ThÂ» Call.
SAX RAFAEL, April I.â The automo
bile law passed by the Legislature has
filled the hearts of Marin's automobil
ists with joy, as it nullifies the county
ordinance which prohibited the use of
automobiles on the public highways
after sundown.
The ordinance was obnoxious to the
owners of motor cars, and for the last
year they have been endeavoring to
find a legal defect in it.
Last August Thomas C. Berry, a
well-known resident of Ross Valley, at
tempted to run his machine after sun
down and was promptly arrested. Ber
ry's friends advised him to test the
validity of the ordinance, and acting
on that advice he applied for a writ of
habeas corpus. The case is now pend
ing before the Supreme Court.
Marin's ordinance put a damper on
the use of autos, as after sundown the
beautiful drives throughout the county
were unavailable. Now that the law
has been nullified many San Francisco
antomobilists have expressed their in
tention of summering in this county.
MARIN JUSTICE
LOSES HIS FEE
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN RAFAEL, April 1. -Justice of
the Peace Magee says a joke is a joke,
but a joke that deprives a Justice of his
fee is no joke at all.
When Patrick Henry Vahey and Mar
garet Mary McGrath of San Francisco
called upon Magee this morning and
requested that he unite them in wed
lock the popular magistrate put on his
best smile and extended a hearty wel
come to thr couple. Visions of an ex
tra fine luncheon and probably a drive
through the valley flashed through his
mind as he proceeded with the cere
mony. But "when the groom fondly
kissed thr bride and whispered, "This
will be an April f<>ol joke on some one,"
it daNvned on Justice Magee that it was
April 1.
When the nuptial knot had been tied
Mr. and Mrs. Vahey gave the Judge a
pleasant v nod and started for the door.
"By the way," suggested the aston
ished magistrate, "haven't you forgot
ten my fee?"
"Oh, that's all right. Judge," replied
Vahey. "I'm broke, but still . I am very,
much obliged to you. Ta-ta."
Vahey and his bride then disappeared
as suddenly and quietly as they came.

ROMANCE GETS
A HARD BLOW
OAKLAND, April I.â This city is
no longer to be the Gretna Green of
sloping San Francisco couples, and it
is claimed the sage legislators, in
passing a law prohibiting the issuance
of a license to a couple outside of the
county jof either the bride or groom,
struck a death blow to romance. There
is mourning also in the camp of the
local Justices of the Peace, whose
monthly incomes have been material
ly increased in limes past by the fees
received for the tying of lovers' knots.
The law, which will go into effect
in a few days, means that every cou
ple must be married in his or her home
county. Young tÂ«ochinvar is to be
relegated into the realm of myth. No
more will man and maid, feeling the
promptings of spring, be able to hie
themselves to distant fields and pledge
their troth among strangers. H. S. G.
McCartney of Los Angeles, it is stated,
was reeponsible for the passage of the
measure, and will be execrated by
would-be eloping couples for all time.
HAGGARD TELLS
OF HIS MISSION
Famous Novelist Addresses
Audience of College Men
at the State University
BERKELEY. April I.â H. Rider
Haggard delivered an address at the
university this morning to an audi
ence that completely filled Harmon
Gymnasium. Hundred* were unable
to obtain admittance. The distin
guished novelist was introduced by
President Benjamin Ide Wheeler as
"an Anglo-Saxon whose message to
his kinsmen on this side of the At
lantic is well worth hearing."
Haggard's tall, slim figure bowed in
recognition of the university presi
dent's hearty eulogy as he rose to
greet the folk gathered to hear him
speak. With the deliberation of the
-typical Briton, the guest of honor be
gan his address, which was intended
to reveal the speaker's serious view
of serious things, particularly with re
lation to sociological problems. The
novelist referred modestly to his au
thorship of books that have made him
famous and added that while the
books in question may have amused
or interested the world, he wished
now to be heard as one with a serious
purpose rather than as a writer of
light literature.
The evils attending the congestion
of great populations in large cities of
the earth, evils so hideous that they
poi lend, in the opinion of Haggard,
the overthrow of western civilization
unless a cure for the cause of the dis
ease is jfound, have attracted the
speaker's attention and aroused his
interest until now he devotes his en
tire time to seeking means of amel
iorating the ills of which he speaks.
SLUMS OF LOXDON.
The slums of London, he declared,
breed iniquity and send forth moral
miasma of such foulness as to vitally
affect the health of the entire British
nation and in similar fashion, Hag
gard said, the slum population of
other great cities has influence upon
the life of the nation which permits
such conditions to exist. Haggard be
lieves that the very hsart of civiliza
tion Is rotting as a result of this
thing and he has made it his life work
to toil with such men as General
Booth of the Salvation Army and
others of political and social fame in
an attempt to change, in every way
possible, the conditions that make
possible these festering evlls.\
Haggard said that he came to Amer
ica as the representative of the British
Government to study colony life here,
so that he can recommend upon his re
turn the founding of proper colonial en
terprises in America and other coun
tries for those of the great English cit
ies who now live in squalor and in re
stricted areas, a prey to disease and fit
subjects for the propagation of crime
bacilli.
A strong word picture was drawn by
Haggard as he contrasted the possibil
ities of life in the slums and tenements
and life in the broad, free prairies or
mountains of such a land as this. He
urged that those who heard him give
heed to the problem which he and other
Englishmen are trying to solve, and to
aid, if possible, in speeding the day
when a satisfactory solution should be
provided. Haggard concluded his ad
dress with the following words:
MISERY AND SIX.
"A few years ago I noticed that the
land in which I lived was being swept
of its best, and the cities became glut
ted and seething tanks of misery and
:sin. You may say that the rich live in
the city; but five minutes from the
houses of the wealthy what do you
see? In England to-day the conditions
ir. the cities, in the slumsi is terrible.
The civilized people of the Western^
world must stop this conglomeration of
people in a few la*rge cities or it is in
evitable that race suicide of the most
aggravated type will grow.
"Another danger is from the East.
Unless we reform the Mongol hordes.

' THE KiNG'C^^fliÃ^'
BLOOD PURiFIERSISSS
In every collection of things there is a superior, one that stands S^jr
above all the rest and is kn^wn as the best, or king of its class. By I *
its record of forty years of cures S. S. S. has demonstrated its superi- - "*"^ Kf/ 1 "
ority over all other blood purifiers and is known and recognized every- â¢ '>^^^^^^$I|j /
where as the bestâThe King of Blood Purifiers. The people everywhere "^^^wf
endorse it, and there are few homes where this great remedy is not known and ' n^l
used, and today there are thousands in all parts of the country who have been cured jl
of diseases by its use and who are daily recommending it 1 to those who are in need of |
a blood purifier. llt has held the confidence of the public for this long period of time, *\\
and is more in favor now than ever before, because it does all that is claimed for it, .
and "S. S. S. for the blood" has grown to be a household saying.
y â . .Â» One of its greatest claims to the title of "The King of Blood Purifiers" is that it is,
purely vegetable, being made entirely from roots, herbs and barks of the forests and fields,
selected for their purifying and healing action on the r blood and their v fine tonic properties
for building up and strengthening the entire system. Not so with the usual blood medicines,
for they contain Potash and other strong mineral ingredients that derange the stomach and
digestion and otherwise damage the health.
Bad blood is responsible for most of tlje ailments of mankind. When from any cause
the Liver, Kidneys, Bowels or other organs of bodily waste become torpid, dull or sluggish
in their action, and fail to carry out the poisons which are being constantly formed in the
system, these poisons are absorbed by the blood. As this vital fluid is the very life of the
body, nourishing and supplying strength, through its circulation, to every muscle, nerve,
bone and tissue, disease in some form is sure to follow when it becomes contaminated.
..' : ';..: :â â â â *â â : . Eczema, Tetter, Acne, Pimples, Boils,

amount of salves, washes, skin foods, rouge,
etc., can reach the trouble; a real blood remedy is required. S. S. S. cures these and all other
skin diseases, and when it has cleansed the blood of the poisons and impurities the cure is
permanent and lasting. Rheumatism, Catarrh, Scrofula, Chronic Sores or Ulcers and Con-
tagious Blood Poison are all deep-seated blood diseases. When the blood becomes contami-
nated with the poisons producing these diseases, the entire circulation grows polluted and
vitiated, and these painful and dangerous diseases will continue to grow worse until this vital
fluid is cleansed and made strong and healthy again. . - "
In all these disorders S. S. S. has proved itself a perfect. remedy, and has well earned
the title of "The King of Blood Purifiers." It goes down into the blood and forces out all
poison of every kind, all waste and foreign matter, and makes it pure and health-sustaining
as nature intended, curing the disease permanently. Nothing reaches inherited blood taint
or old chronic troubles like S. S. S., and being a strictly vegetable remedy it can be taken
by old ; or young without fear of bad after-effects or injury in any way to the system. Not
only is S. S. S. a blood purifier and system builder of the highest order, but a tonic and
appetizer without an equal, and is unexcelled in cases of general debility, loss of appetite, .
Weakness, that tired, run-down condition, lack of energy and force, I and other distressing
complaints common to Spring and Summer months.

will sweep over us, as they have done
in the past. The men are strong in
Asia; and why? Because they are
brave, because they ar patriotic, be
cause they are determined and whole
hearted. But why are all these things
true? Because they have drawn on a
land of primitive virtues, which alone
make people great. That I believe to
be the absolute truth.
"It is worth while to help in that
movement. It is no small thing; it is
the greatest. I do hope that what I

with you. and that all of you may do
what I believe is a very great and
vital work. I am addressing here a
large number of young men who are
about to enter upon life.
"There is just a word I wish to add
to the young men. We are told nowa
days that the world is very prosy,
sordid and unromantic. Ido not quite
think so. There is romance in every
line of life and work to do. Just look
now upon the careers of such men as
Charles Gordon, who perished at
Khartoum â what an example of a ro
mantic figure. Would It have been
said that within this prosy age and
world that such a man could have
arisen to-be a glory to us for all time?
Cecil Rhodes is another. What an
image be became, not in the world of
finance, but as a builder? He was a
man who began as any of us might
have begun. He was the sixth son of
a clergyman in England â a man with
out any means. *
"I believe him to -be one of the
greatest men of the entire century.
In his brief forty-six years he r.dded a
territory larger than the United States
to the civilized world. It was not ac
cident. The man aimed toward it and
willed it and achieved it. And General
Booth â look at that man! He began
without any advantages, and he has
instituted the greatest charitable or
ganization that the world has seen.
And he did it by settling to an ob
ject, by strength of will, by determin
ed and ordered effort, by the exercise
of a marvelous goodness of heart.
â With such examples before us, none
of us need feel that^here is nothing
left undone."

SETON TALKS
ON WILD LIFE
Of all the animal stories that have
â¢vÂ»r been told. Ernest Thompson-Se
ton's tale of the passing of Robo, the
gray wolf, is the most wonderful and
the most touching. He gave three il
lustrated lectures at the Alhambra
yesterday, rattling oft* smoothly fas
cinating tales of Indians, animals,
tracks and Figns. All of them were I
worth hearing, but the story of Robo. i
the gray wolf, is the masterpiece of
"The Friend of the Wild."
Robo, the leader of the park that
harassed the cattle men. could not be
caught by traps, no matter how cun
ningly laid. But he took unto him
self a mate and through her \v*s his
undoing wrought. Robo could aiways
scent a trap and turn aside the pack,
but Blanca. thÂ° vrhfte wolf who was
his m-ire. was very foolish.
.-â¢ One right she refused to heed the :
admonition of ftobo and was' "caught
in a trap cunningly laid by Setnn. The
cowboys roped her- and between two 'â 
tugging ponies she was strangled to !
death by lariats.
All day long Robo howled from the
bluffs. It was novthe deep mustering'
cry that he rafMd. but a plaintive call,
with a wierd ring of sorrow or pain
in it. But Blanca lay stiff and cold
in a cattle man's cabin.
On the next day Seton set traps in
even- trail leading to the ranch. After
carefully concealing them he took the
carcass of Blanca and made tracks
with her paws around the hidden
traps.
At night the big jrray wolf came
and found what h^ thought was his
mate's trail. All caution left him and
Robo rushed In the direction he
thought she had taken. The sharp
ie*th sprung upon hir fore feet. Robo,
the gray wolf, arap trapped.
When Seton and a cowboy came
upon him he lifted his head and
the mustering call for the pack.
The cry rang wildly through the can
yons, but when the echoes died down
there was no answer. The gTay wolf
faced his adversaries, calmly waiting
the end. He knew that he must make
his last stand alone.
While Seton told of his animal
friends some of his remarkable
sketches and photographs were
thrown upon a screen. The subjects
of the lectures were as follows: "The
Indians as I Know Them. " 'The Per
sonality of Wild Animal?" and "New
Adventures of Animal Friends."
Chock Proves Worthless.

SHOOTS WIFE
IN A CHURCH
Nebraskan Attempts Murder
While Congregation Is At
tending Special Services
THEN KILLS HIMSELF
Woman Marked for Death
Escapes With a Superficial
Wound in the Neck
Special Dispatch to Th* Call
HOWELLS, Nebr., April 1. â After
shooting' his wife as she sat In her pew
In church during special services, cow-
Ing the other worshipers by bran
dishing- the smoking- revolver and
threatening- any one who interfered,
Â£. D. Novak coolly walked out of the
s&cred edifice, inarched up the main
street of the town and finally shot
himself to death in a summer kitchen
In the rear of h!s home.
Novak and his wife have had
trouble for several years. Without
giving any hint of his murderous in
tentions, Novak entered the church
during* the services and walked
straight up the aisle to where his wife
sat. Drawing a revolver, he pointed
it directly at her face and flred. With
a laugh Novak turned and walked
slowly down the aisle, brandishing the
revolver and threatening to shoot any
one who made a move to stop him.
Leaving the church, Novak walked de
liberately through the main part of
the town, still swinging his revolver.
His only daughter. Rose, was alone
In the house and when the girl saw
him coming up the street fiourishrng
the weapon she hastened to lock the
doors. Unable to enter the house,
Novak went around to the rear and
Into a summer kitchen and immediate
ly shot himself in the head.
Mrs. Novak fortunately escaped with
a comparatively slight wound. The bul
let entered the side of her neck. The
wound was dresaed and the woman
was able to walk to her home.
Happiness is the state of your mind :
and not of your bank account. Million

Human hair
and how
to grow it
The hair of the head has , .
always been a source' of"
pride to both men and
women throughout, all the
world's history, and its loss
or deterioration is a source . .
of keen mortification .; ... ..
and regret.
From time to time
various so-called remedies
for falling hair and the
various diseases of the-
scalp have been foisted upon
the public, and the failure
of these to do any perma-
nent good has only . added
disappointment to discour-
agement.
One remedy, however â
Coke Dandruff Cure â
has proved itself capable â 
of doing everything
claimed for it and of being-
worthy of the confidence. of
a much abused public. â¢
It will remove dandruff,
it will cure diseases of- the
scalp, it will put new life
into the old follicles and
consequently will actually
grow hair on a bald head.
An incredulous smile
may pass over the face
of the reader of the last
paragraph, but thousands
of testimonials on file in
our office prove it beyond
the shadow of a doubt, and
your druggist, no matter
: where he may be, will, tell
you the same story.

SUBTLETIES OF LAW
BEWILDER YE POY
Oriental Mind Cannot Harmonize Certain
Time-Honored American Statutes.
JAMES C. CRAWFORD
Yp Poy, whose laundry is at 240
Eleventh street, confesses that his
Oriental mind, although not excep
' tionaily obtuse, is incapable of digest
ing into a harmonious whole some of
the law* which are time honored in
this community. For instance, there
is a statute which makes it obligatory
on Ye Poy's part to give a written re
ceipt for articles deposited for his
professional treatment, said receipt
ostensibly being intended to protect
both him and the depositor, yet if the
depositor fails to produce said re
ceipt and Ye Poy refuses to deliver
said articles, said depositor can recov
er possession of said articles by re
sorting to another time honored stat
ute, which enables their recovery by
process of search warrant. The sub
tleties of this contradictory proced
ure are too profound for Ye Poy's
sense of reason and justice to assimi
late.
"Makee me allee samee dam
foolee," he protested to Policeman
"Jack" Laws, who was detailed to re
cover for Miss Etheline Dodson of
530 Golden Gate avenue the lingerie
which she had left with him to be
"done up," and his receipt for which
she had lost.
"But it's the law," said the officer.
"Law no goodee," declared Ye Poy.
Law say, 'No getee tickee, no givee
washee.' Len lady she say, "Losee
tickee, wantee washee.' Len I say,
'Law say no getee tickee, no givee
washee.' Len lady bling law, an' law
t>ay, 'No tickee, givee washee allee
samee.' Law clazee."
His resolute refusal to give up Miss
Dodson's property, although she ac
curately described and positively iden
tified it, led to his arrest and he was
booked for resisting an officer. When
the case was called before Judge Mo
gan the complainant was there, but
Ye Poy, who had been released on
I bail, failed to appear and his absence
I was explained by notification from a
hospital that he was therein confined
with nervous prostration, evidently in
duced by his mental wrestle with the
! intricacies of American law. The
] case was continued till next Thursday.
Miss Fannie Martin, school teacher,
residing in Alameda, was crossing
Market street, near Powell, one after
noon about a month ago when a bi
cycle ridden by Rego Coslodio knocked
her down, and for several weeks she
was under treatment for concussion of
the brain. In the court of Judge Mo
gan yesterday she identified Coslodio
as the man who prostrated her and
said she would be satisfied if he were
compelled to pay the expenses In
curred by her injury. Coslodio de
murred on the ground that the dam
age was unintentional on his t>art and
not even a result of carelessness, as he
was dodging a "chuck hole" In the
asohaltum pavement when the colli
sion occurred. He pleaded poverty also,
saying he was employed in a furniture
factory and received scanty wages.
The Judge, however, held that if the
defendant had not been riding at ex
cessive speed he could have dodged
the "chuck hole" without striking the
lady and that if reasonable damages
were not paid by him he would be sen
tenced for battery.
After the Police Judges had ex
plained to the Grand Jury why arrests
for pool selling or buying are so sel
dom followed by conviction, his Honor
Mogan returned to court and was con
fronted by the case of Charles Hamil
ton, accused of keeping a poolselling
place in connection with hi 3 cigar
store at 256 Third street, and of
Charles Thompson aid Joseph Ed
wards, charged with having visited
said place for the purpose of betting.
Patrolman C. F. Thompson, the
complaining witness, testified that in
company with Patrolman Nolan he
found Hamilton ostensibly attending to
his cigar business and the other two
defendants perusing a list of "over
night entries." He saw no betting nor
did he hear any proposal to bet, and
the only material evidence he had to
offer consisted of several cards in
scribed "C. T. 5.," which he found in
a cigar box.
"This case," said the Judge, "is a fair
sample of the pool-selling cases brought
into this court. There is absolutely no
evidence that pools have been sold by
the defendant^ Hamilton, or that pools
have been bought from him by these
other men. To pronounce the defend
ants guilty as charged would be a
travesty on law and justice, yet failure
to convict them may be utilized by the
police to bolster their plea that en
deavor to suppress the pool-selling evil
Is not properly supported by the mag
istrates. Now, I do not desire to be
understood as censuring you. Policeman
Thompson, or the captain who com
mands you, any more than I desire to
be regarded as exercising undue le
niency toward persons charged with
violating the anti-pool ordinance; but
I do not approve the filing of com
plaints by the District Attorney's office
on such meager evidence as has been
presented in this case and almost every
case of its kind. Nor do I presume to
instruct the Police Department as to
the methods it should pursue in these
cases, but I think that if detectives
properly disguised were to buy pools it
would be easier to obtain conviction of
the persons who sell them. If such evi
dence as that Is brought here I will
convict the defendant, regardless of who
or what he is. That is all I have to
say at present about what is termed in
street parlance 'the passing of the
buck' from the police to the magis
trates when inquiry is made as to why
pool-selling cannot "be suppressed.
These defendants are dismissed."

It was on Grant avenue, near Sutter
street, that Jacob Sverto was accosted
by the two confidence men. He recent
ly came from Eureka, and when one of
them stopped him, took possesion of his
hand, cordially wrung it and as cor
dially exclaimed, "Well, if it ain't old
Bvertol" he said, "Why, howdy do?"
although he had no recollection of hav
ing seen the man prior to that moment.
But he was lonesome and of amiable
nature.
"And how's old Eureek?" inquired
the handshaker. "When did you come
down and what are you doing? Allow
me to introduce my friend. Let's get a
drink."
Then the old, moss-covered story of
bunko was repeated. Mr. Sverto, after
allowing himself to be convinced that
he was in company of a former ac
quaintance, immediately mentioned
that he was seeking employment, and
was immediately requested to congrat
ulate himself that he had met his com
panions, who were in search of a man
to work in a wine cellar lor good wages.
"But you mustn't drink too much,"
he was warned, "for the last fellow
who had the job was fired for hittin'
up the booze too lively."
Mr. Sverto promised to be a model
cf sobriety, and then they escorted
him to the Palace Hotel and intro
duced him to a man whom they al
leged to be the wine merchant. He
made a few inquiries as to Mr. Sver
to's habits and then engaged him on
the spot after receiving from him the
sum of $30 as security that he would
not disappoint his employer by failing
to report for duty the following morn
ing at 9 Post street. When he ex
pressed a desire to commence work
right then his shoulder was patted ap
provingly and he was escorted to 9
Post street, where he was left stand
ing at the door while his guides dis
appeared through Lick Alley.
When the case was reported to the
police Patrolman "Nick" Bakulich,
acting on Mr. Sverto's description of
the trio, arrested Antonio Tolomi,
who was identified by Mr. Sverto as
one of the two "steerers." Judge Mo
gan continued the case till to-mor
row, by which time the prisoner's
confederates will probably be sharing
his incarceration.
H. W. Guess (colored) embezzled $9
belonging to the Sutter-street mer
chant by whom he was employed as
a porter, and in the court of Judge
Mogan he said he wagered and lost
the money on the Johnson-Hart prize
fight.
"Ef dat yah big stiff, Johnsing.

THIRST AFTER
INDIAN BLOOD
Citizens of Nye County. Ne
vada, Are in Angry Mood
Over Piute Depredations
RED MEN ARE RAMPANT
Unlawful Liquor Traffic Is
Responsible for Crime in
the Sagebrush State
The citizens of the -southern part of
Nye County, Nevada, are threatening
to organize a vigilance committee with
a view of stamping out the li
quor traffic between white men
and Indians. In the thickly set
tled districts, like Tonopah, Gold
field and Kawich, the best order
prevails, but in the sparsely populated
sections of the more remote part of the
county there practically exists a reign
of terror as a result of the drunken
acts of the Piutes. According to John
L. Considine, Warden of Nevada's
State prison, who has been a guest at
the St. Franci3 Hotel for several days,
the citizens of Nye County are in an
exceedingly angry mood and it will
need but a call from some good leader
to bring them together for the purpose
of adopting drastic measures against
the white men who are supplying Pi
utes with liquor.
"Although there are Federal and
State laws prohibiting the sale of
liquor to Indians," said Considine, "for
some strange reason parts of Nye
County are not being properly protect
ed against this traffic. The Piutes
seem to have little trouble in getting
all the firewater they want and of late
they have been going on big drunks
and committing all kinds of depreda
tions. In consequence many of Neva
da's citizens have found it necessary
to take the law into their own hands
for self-protection, and tragedies ensue
which the outside world never hears of.
"Only recently County Treasurer
Gilbert was corraled on the main
street of Belmont, the county
seat, by a drunken Indian, and
it was only Gilbert's alertness and
quick use of his pistol that saved his
life. The Indian's life was sacrificed to
the lawlessness of certain white men
who were cruel enough to give the red
man whiskey. Another affair that can
be directly attributed to the unlawful
sale of liquor to Indians occurred lately
near Kawich. John Doherty, consult
ing engineer of the Kawich Mining
Company, was traveling from the com
pany's mine to Goklfleld one night
when a drunken Indian held him up
and compelled him to hand over a va
lise containing rich ore specimens that
Doherty intended to ship to San Fran
cisco to have made into quartz jewelry.
The specimens, worth several hundred
dollars, were afterward found scattered

STRIKE TRAIL OF A POOLROOM CORRUPTION FUND
Foreman Andrews of the Grand Jury made the startling charge yesterday that places where pools on horse races are sold and other resorts of questionable
racter have for months been contributing to a corruption fund through which the proprietors have received immunity from arrest and prosecution.
irand Jury knows the names of the persons who made the collections and the amount collected, but does not know what officials received the tribute
levied. It is now endeavoring to get that information.
Andrews also declared he knew the name of the man who offered Merrill $i coo to leave town and not appear as witness against Maestretti.

CLEVER PITCHER FOR THE BLUE A.VL- GOLD, WHOSE HIGH CLASS WORK

ley xi-hen the final inning of the first
Intercollegiate baseball game was at
an end. The last few minutes of the
p!ay, however, had in them a succes

the California collegians in their

I The ninth inning began with indica
tions of a complete coat of whitewash
for the cardinal players. Trow bridge
hit to rigct field and Scott flew out to
Sueesy. Bell attempted to sacrifice,
but the ball was passed by Oausley to
Gillis, and Trowbridge was caught at
second. Bell lingered, rather moodily,
on first, for with two men out his
chances of making -the circuit seemed
dubious enough.
Then Fenton cam:? to. bat â the game
Fetiton who by a masterly bit of foot
ball strategy won the freshman game
of football for Stanford last term. Fen
ton is rather slight, but when his bat
connected with one of Heitmuller's
best there was a reverberation and the
ball was observed to be floating out
toward the old "football bleachers in
right field. Streub scampered for it. but
the leather rolled away toward the en
trance sate, while Ferton sind Bell leis
urely journeyed homeward.
The crowd, that had hitherto regard
ed California's victory as a foregone
conclusion, sat up now and prepared
for another bit <-,f excitement and a
-ranford victory. The cardi
nal rooterÃ cheered their men on. and
all the resources of several hundred
pairs of lungs were used in this at
tempt, but in vain. The excitement
died away, and with it Stanford's hope
of victory or a tie score, when Presley
went outâ the third man out â on a
commonplace fly to left field.
The score stood 3 to 2 and California
had drawn first blood in the battle with
Stanford for baeebail supremacy.
The game was witnessed by about
3000 persons, hundreds finding points of
vantage on the campug hillocks. Stan
ford brought no brass band and all the
instrumental music waa supplied by
California. Hundreds of cardinal root
ers were in evidence, however, and they
led a picturesque part of the
spectacle.
Two of California's runs were scored
in the second inning. Errors by Stan
ford men were responsible for them in
part. Heitmuiier walked and Streub
hit to third. Fenton fumbled the ball
and Streub was safe. Jordan struck
out. niliis bunted. Stott fumbled the
ball and Gillis was safe. With the bases
'iunn sacrificed. The ball went to
Sales, who threw to first Instead of
home and thus permitted Heitmuiier
" reub to score.
California's third run came in the
j seventh inning, when, with two men
out, Causley made first through Trow
i bridge's error. Bliss hit to left field
; and Graham followed with a similar
hit, scoring Causley. The score: .1"

SAX FRANCISCO. SUXDAY , APRIL 2, 1905.
MOULLEN TAKEN
THREE EVENTS
Captain of Lick School Team
Is Star, of the Athletic
Field Day at Ingieside
NEW POLEVAULT RECOKI)
standard for San Francisco
League Is Raised Three
and One-Qnarter Inches
Captain Moullen of Lick School car
ried off the lion's share of the honors in
the seventh semi-annual field day of
the Saa Francisco Athletic League yeÂ«
terday at Ingieside racecourse. He won
the polevault. the shotput and the
hammer throw. In the polevault he
raised the league record from 10 feet 6
inches to 10 fe-.-t 9?. i inches. The per
formance was especially good, as the
gr. .und at the take-off was rough.
The mite relay race, as usual, pro
vided the most exciting contest of the
day. Only three teams started â Lowell.
Lick and VVihr.enJing. Lowell and Lick
alternated in the lead, the representa
tive of the former having the last relay
finally winning by live yards in 3 min
utes 34 seconds. The Wilmerding run
ner on the. first relay lodged a claim of
foul against Lowell, but it was not al
lowed. It did not affect the result of
the field day.
The Lowell High School distance run
ners repeated their victory of last week
at Berkeley in the trying two-mile race.
Lang and Garvin, team mates, had suf
ficient lead at the finish to make it a
dead heat. The time was slow.
Th* representatives of Lick School
won fight of the thirteen events on the
card, scoring a total of 55 i>oints.
Lowell won three races and a number
"f pecond places, which gave it a total
of 40 poimt-.

Grand Jury Finds Evidence of Collections
to Purchase Immunity From the Law.
Will Begin Crusade
to Close Gaming
Resorts.
Police Judges Agree
to Impose Heavy
Penalties.
Foreman Andrews of the Grand
Jury made the direct charge yesterday
that a large corruption fund hud been
wrung from the poolrooms and "other
places"' for months and that immunity
from arrest and prosecution had been
bought with it for the contributors.
He said the Grand Jury knew how
much had been paid for this purpose
and who had made the collections.
The question the body of which he was
the head had to solve was what of
ficials received the money paid for
immunity.
The war on the poolrooms is to be
gin to-morrow. The Grand Jury, the
Police Department and the Police
Judges have joined hands for a vigor
ous campaign and assurance is given
that the evil will be wiped out. De
tectives are to gather more evidence
to add to that already collected by the
Grand Jury and arrests are to be made
forthwith.
Foreman Andrews had planned to
open the light yesterday. Men who
have been employed to visit the pool
rooms and purchase tickets were on
hand.,Â«tÂ»t^e 11 til :, of t Justice to swear
out >aj-r.inis. . J3ut District Attorney
Byington advised a slight chr.nge in
the plan of action 'and drastic steps
were postponed till Monday. '-If ar
rests are not made then the delay will
be for the purpose of getting â¢ more
cases in shape for prosecution. It is
announced that during the week at the
latest the campaign will : be -on in full
blast. . , ', . ; : ; .- - .
Over 100 poolrooms have. been flour
ishing in the city for months past and
the administration has not raised a
hand against them. The plea of the
Police Department is that their efforts
have been mil lined by the refusal of
the Police Judges to impose sufficient
fines when arrests were made.
CORRUPTION FUND COLLECTED.
But the Grand Jury whs not content
with this explanation. Xight before
last the meeting with the Commission
ers was held and they promised that
the Police Department would do its
duty. Yesterday morning a conference
was had with the Police Judges and
they declared themselves willing at all
times to levy heavy fines and make
punishment sufficiently severe to wipe
out the gambling.
"Tribute has been levied on the
poolrooms and other places for many
months past," declared Foreman An
drews. "We know who made the col
lections, how much was paid and that
immunity from arrest and prosecution
followed."
'Where did the money go?"
"Upstairs."
"Where is that?"
"That's what the Grand Jury has
been trying to find out. The puzzle
is, for whose benefit has thi3 big cor
ruption fund been gathered?"
JUDGES Dl CONFERENCE.
The Judges present at the confer
ence yesterday were Mogan, Cabaniss
and Conlan. Fritz was unable to at
tend because of pressing business, but
in the strictures that the Police De
partment makes on the courts he had
not fared so ill as did the other
Judges. On the contrary, reference
had been made to the fact that he
fined a lottery ofTender $250. whereas
in another court in a similar case the
penalty was but $10.
The three Police Judges were boil
ing with indignation yesterday morn
ing when they learned that the Police
Commission at the Grand Jury con
ference the night before had shunted
to their shoulders the blame for fail
ure to enforce the law against pool
rooms, sale of lottery tickets, liquor
selling without license, disorderly re
sorts and for many other instances of
laches on the part of the department.
There was no measuring of terms
when they left their benches and went
into the conference with the grand
jurors that Foreman Andrews called
yesterday morning.
In strong words the Judges passed
the buck right back to the Police De
partment. Never had they been un
willing to do their duty, they asserted.
The police had been flagrantly negli
gent in theirs, was the reply to the
commii"ion's criticism. â¢
The Judges explained that the rea
son for dismissals and light fines In
poolroom and lottery cases was the
failure of the police to make out their
cases. The patrolman making the ar
rest would be woefully ignorant of
evidence when called to the stand. He
would shy from giving testimony that
would justify conviction or severe
penalty. The stand-in" policy of the
CABLE-OAR URIIJUX WHO SAY.-: HE WAS APPROACHED BY A MAX :RED HIM : DTSATOLIUI 9O HE
COULD NOT T,E SERVED WITH A ST'BPENA TO APFEAI
MAESTRETTI. CHARGED WITH SUBORNATION OF fTTR.HKY.
BELIEVES OFFER OF MONEY
TRACEABLE TO MAESTRETTI
Foreman Andrews Declares Indicted ConrMnissioner Knew of Attempt
to Pay Merrill, Principal Witness, to Leave State.
Public Work\ Commissioner Frank
A. Maestretti was arraigned before
Judge Lawlor yesterday morning on
the Indictment for subornation of per
jury. Owing to the absence of counsel
the defendant was not called on to en
ter his plea, the matter going over for
one week. H. H. Davis, H. C. Dibble
and ex-Governor Budd will conduct his
defense.
Among the spectators at the pro
ceedings were Foreman Andrews and
E. J. Bowes of the Grand Jury. They
had been subpenaed as witnesses in
another matter, but they were intent
listeners when the case of the Com-
missioner was called.
Later in the day Foreman Andrews
police when the cases came into court
was responsible, the Judges charged,
for all that the Grand Jury has to
complain about.
WTLiLING TO AID CRUSADE.
"You can depend on it that if the
evidence warrants conviction we will
impose fines that will make it highly
unprofitable to conduct any business
that is in violation of the law," de
clared the Police Judges in unison.
So, under the direction of the
Grand Jury, the war is to be opened. !
Policemen are to be at free disposal
and arrests are to be made without j
let-up. Injunctions are to be expect
ed, but they are to be defeated or
circumvented by every resource. The
campaign looks business-like and the
flying of fur Is to be expected. .^__
gave out a sensational statement as to
the identity of the person who offered
Charles E. Merrill, the principal wit
ness against Maestrettl. 11500 to leave
the State.
"We have successfully traced Maes
tretti's connection with this attempt to
tamper with our most important wit
ness." said the foreman. "I will say,
however, that the evidence is not suf
ficient to found any accusation."
"Is the man still in the city .who
made the offer?"
"Yes. he is right here in San Fran
cisco and we can lay our hands on
him at any time."
'We are convinced that Merrill told
us a straight story." continued An
drews, "and we are now convinced
"I don't believe in trying to make
San Francisco a Puritan city," said
Foreman Andrews yesterday, "nor
does the Grand Jury. But you can
say that so far as the inquisitorial
body is concerned it will not tolerate
the poolrooms. The poolrooms must
be closed or we will know the reason
â why it is impossible to enforce the law
against them.
"More young men go wrong
through this form of gambling than
from any other cause. It would sur
prise you to know how many em
ployes in business houses get Into
trouble because of gambling on the
races. We must be reasonable to
ward some forms of vice. But pool
room gambling shall not be allowed
In San Francisco If it Is In the power
of the Grand Jury to stop It.
Pages 41 to 52
that Maestrettl \ himself was involved
In this felonious enterprise.
We know all about that tlsoo
transaction and where the money came
from. I will say that I am convinced
to a moral certainty that th*Â» Public
Wroks CrÂ»mr-.iss?one# had everything
to do with sending an agent to the
car conductor in the effort to get the
most dangerous witness out of the way.
But to prove the fact In court might be
a difficult matter "with the evidence
now in our possession.
"The Grand Jury has its hands full
now and is content for the time being
with the situation. But some day
these people who have thought it safe
to tamper with our witnesses will ftnd
a peck of trobule In store for them."
"The jurors are oaanlmoua in their
attitude against the poolrooms. They
regard it as th | *vil of thÂ« city
to-.lay. Several of them hare come
to learn what pitfalls these places axe.
They have had experience with young
men employes. Gambling on the
races wrecks more men than anything
else I know of and the Grand Jury la
determined that the vice shall be
stamped out."
Kolb and Dill will be given a farewell
testimonial to-nf^at at the Grand Opera-
Honse. It .trill be their last appearance
in San Francisco for several- years, and a
most â¢ attractive programme, which will
include the musical absurdity. "I O LV
will be presented. There will also be 'new
specialties and speeches of farewell.

Sutro Heights Addition is the connecting !
link between the Golden Gate Park and Sutro i
Heights.

street and Sutro Heights avenue, 46th and 40th ;

This is the only property adjacent to the ',
ocean and Golden Gate Park, where streets
are on official grades and macadamized.
SEWER, WATER AND GAS MAINS LAID.
Grandest marine view property in ! all the i
city; no other city in the United States, or, i
perhaps, the world affords residence sites
with such elevation, unobstructed marine and
scenic views and so close to the ' pleasure
grounds of the , people. It faces the Golden |
Gate Park, thÂ« ocean and adjoins Sutro
Heights, Sutro Baths and Cliff House.
This is not the marine view advertised ' so
indiscriminately, J a marine : view at a great
distance, a mile or two off, but it is the
grandest marine view of the ocean, only a
few hundred feet from your lot. . You have it
right In front of you; you can see and hear
the rolling and roaring of the breakers of the
great ; Pacific. ' â â¢ _-.: _. .
: ALL LARGE LOTSâ BO-foot frontagesâ the
special feature of this tract Is' It' gives op-
portunity for a better class of residences. 1
Several beautiful homes are â â¢ contracted for
and will be in course of construction shortly.
' Did you ever realise that they are only a
few blocks north of Golden Gate Park, so near
the ocean, and that every lot sold means a
choice lot less to be had and ' makes yours
morÂ« valuable?
