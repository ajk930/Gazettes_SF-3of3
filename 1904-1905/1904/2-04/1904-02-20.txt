Jackson, a small telegraph station on
the cut-off and about eighty-five miles
from Off den. Extra 2833 was taking
the siding and extra 2116. which held
the right of track, was coming down
the grade into the station. The air
brake failed to work ancl 2116 could
not make the stop and crashed Into
2833 on the switch. A t2rrific explo

were blown to pieces, among the num
ber being five outfit cars containing
twenty-one Greek laborers, who were
blown several hundred feet from the
track.

quake. The telegraph station at Colon,
fifty-five miles distant, had every win
dow pane broken. The explosion was
so tremendous that the first knowledge
of the disaster, instead of being re
ceived by telegraph from the scene of
the disaster, was communicated from
Terrace and Lucin, operators at those
points reporting to headquarters that
a calamity had occurred. The people
of Terrace, looking south across the

PRECIOUS JEWELS OF JAPAN GO TO THE WAR FUND
Bank Accepts the Deposits
With Approval of
Sovereign.
TOKTO. Feb. 19.â The Bank of Japan
decided to-day to accept deposits of
plate and jewels in aid of the war fund.
President Sonoda and the nobles of the
bank recently offered to melt the plate
and gold gifts made by the Emperor
to the fund. The Emperor approved
the suggestion and also ordered the
conversion of large quantities of old
coins and other palace treasures. His
example is being generally and patri
otically followed and promises to swell
tho war fund enormously. The Bank
of Japan offers to accept such treasures
at current rates, either buying them
outright or returning them at the ex

PHYSICIAN'S AGREE
IX THE FAIK CASE
Williamson Hacks Up the Statement
of Gallwoy Tliat the Woman Must
Have Ilccn First to Die.
During h's direct examination before
Commissioner Hosmer, yesterday. Dr.
Williamson corroborated the testimony
given by Dr. Gallwey Thursday, in the
Fair litigation. Dr. Williamson is
positive that ilrs. Fair met with in
etant death and that Charles L.. Fair
must have lived a few moments, at
least, after the fatal accident.
The cross-examination of Dr. Gallwey
occupied the morning session. His
Boswera to interrogatories were firm
and unhesitating, and did not in any
material way alter his direct testimony.
In answer to an interrogatory, he
etated that he had performed the au
topsies on the bodies of Mr. and Mrs.
Fair, at the request of Reuben H.
Lloyd, who, he understood, represent
ed the family, and was authorized to
employ him in such capacity. He did
not know that the mother of Mrs. Fair
wa,s in the city at the time, and con
rider^d the proceeding perfectly regu
lar. When asked whether he had ever
before performed an autopsy on a body
which had been twenty-eight days
dead, he replied in the affirmative,
staling further that he had performed
autopsies, on bodies which had been
dtad for eighteen months.
At the afternoon session Dr. William
son took the stand and, like Dr.
Gallwey. made a splendid witness for
the defense. He described minutely
the condition of the bodies of both Mr.
and Mrs. Fair and the extent of the
autopsy. It showed, he said, that there
had b<^en no fracture of the lower Jaw,
no fracture of the vault of the skull
and no laceration of the tongue in the
<-ase of Charles L. Fair. The head of
Mrs. Fair, he said, was crushed to a
pulp, and death must have been in
stantaneous.

FOR ANNUAL CONFERENCE
They Will Suggest a State Platform
and May Indirectly Recommend
Presidential Nomination.

Calccaris Gets His Demand.
Judge Hebbard made an order yes
terday directing Auditor Harry Baehr
to turn over to E. A. Calegaris and
thirteen other men employed at the
City and County Hospital during the
months of October. November and De
cember of last year their salary de
mands for those . months. He held
that inasmuch as the services of the
men had been accepted by the city
Baehr had no right to keep the de
mands from the men. The presenta
tion by Calegaris to Baehr of his de
mands a few weeks ago caused a list
fight between the Auditor and Chief
Civil Service Examiner Moran. Baehr
contended that Calegaris and the
others were, not properly certified by
the Civil Service Commissioners and
refused to recognize the demands.
Moran took exception to his remarks,
called him a liar and then they

be constantly subject to underground
attack and that she will see herself
through honest spectacles.
"For years," said a prominent officer
to the Associated Press to-day, "our
country has been the victim of every
imaginable slander and misrepresenta
tion because it was known that tele
grams addressed to foreign news
sources went through the hands of the
Russian censor. Any story, no matter
how baseless or exaggerated, that w^is
sent surreptitiously across the border
was greedily accepted abroad as true,
especially by Russophobes, because the
Government wuold not put its official
stamp upon It. Regular Russophobic
news factories have been in operation
in Berlin, Vienna and elsewhere, and
these have spread the most absurd and
preposterous libels supplied by the ene
mies of Russia. Every act of the Gov
ernment has been twisted and distort
ed. Insignificant student affairs or
workmen's riots, such as would not at
tract general attention elsewhere, have
been magnified into great movements
of popular discontent, until certain por
tions of the world have been led to be
lieve that Russia was perpetually on
the eve of a great revolution.
"Some English newspapers especially
have conducted systematic campaigns
against us. Moreover, the fact that
dispatches were censored has often
been interpreted as semi-official au
thorization, when perhaps they in no
sense represented the views of the Gov
ernment. Hereafter correspondents of
foreign newspapers will be untram
meled. We expect to see Russia pre
sented in her true light.
"The opening of the floodgates may
result in the stirring up of as much
mud as possible by those evilly dis
posed, but we feel confident that In the
end truth will prevail. We are not
afraid to have the light turned on us.
We are proud of our country and we
are entitled to a faithful and honest
presentation of our current history."
Foreign telegrams until recently were
subject to censorship at the Ministry
of Foreign Affairs, but since the death
last fall of M. Gretch, who was at one
time connected with the Russian em
bassy at Washington, the censorship
has been temporarily under the* Min
istry of the Interior, where the perma
nent censors' bureau of plays, books
and newspapers in Russia is situated.
News telegrams addressed to foreign
sources originating in the most dis
tant parts of the empire, Vladivostok
or Odessa, were formerly telegraphed
to St. Petersburg to be passed on. M.
Plehve, Minister of the Interior, and
Count Lamsdorff, Foreign Minister,
both joined in the recommendation that
the censorship be abolished.
The internal censorship is to be re
tained, but foreign dispatches are to be
entirely free. Since a state of war ex
ists, telegrams that treat of hostilities
will be subjected to the same kind of
military censorship enforced v in all
countries under similar circumstances.

some of thÂ» members of the Reichstag

session that Germany had 1939 men, in- 1
eluding non-corfjbatants; Great Britain
had 2725, France "1781, Japan 1287 and
Italy 771 men in China. The present
force in Chilinprovince, the Secretary
explained,' was really too weak td

caution for the preservation of the neu

and Will Limit the Area
of War.
ST. PETERSBURG, Feb. 19. â Rus
sia's reply to Secretary Hay's note on
China was handed to Embassador Mc-
Cormick to-day.
The reply was given to Mr. McCor
mick by Foreign Minister Lamsdorff
and was promptly dispatched to Wash
ington. It is known that the terms of
the reply are along the lines previously
indicated, being a virtual acceptance
in principle, with the exception of
Manchuria, which is now the theater
of war, and where Russia's special in
terests lie.
The Foreign Office explained that
Russia is as solicitous as the other
powers that the neutrality of China
should not be broken and that the area
of hostilities be confined to the narrow
est limits.
The Foreign Office also reported that
Viceroy Alexieff explained that, as
Dalny was practically in a state of

DECLARES PROPOSITION
FAILED TO BE CARRIED
Supreme Court Files Decision Declar
ing That Santa Rosa Is Xot En
titled to Xew Charter.
The Supreme Court has decided that
the city of Santa Rosa is not, entitled
to the charter for which a majority of
votes was cast In the municipal elec
tion of May, 1902. It may also mean
that bonds may not be issued in San
Francisco for .the improvement of
Telegraph Hill.* There is. however,
considerable doubt in the minds of
leading members of the legal frater
nity that the two cases are analogous.
The constitution provides that a
freeholders' charter may be ratified at
a general or special election by a "ma
jority of such qualified electora voting
thereat." In the Santa Rosa genera)
election of 1902 1474 votes were cast.
On the question as to the adoption of
a charter .only 1143 votes were cast.
Of these 611*were in favor of the
proposition and 532 against it. A ma
jority of those voting on the question
of the adoption of the charter were in
favor of it, but not a majority of all
who voted at .the election. The Su
preme Court says that a majority or
all the voters should have voted for
the propsltion in order to have se
cured its passage.
A two-thirds majority of those who
voted on the Telegraph Hill proposi
tion were in favor of it, but not a two
thirds majority of all who voted sit
the election. Our charter says in ref
erence to the passage of bond propo
sitions that there must be a two
thirds majority of such qualified elec
tors voting thereon,". '

Congressman Fitzgerald Says
President Is Unsafe and
May Involve Us in a War
OPPOSES A GREAT NAVY
Speaker Declares That It Is
the Policy of the Adminis
tration to Surpass Germany
WASHINGTON. Feb. 19.â The House
to-day began consideration of the naval
appropriation bill, ten hours being al
lowed for general debate. During th?
general discussion Fitzgerald (Demo
crat) of New York declared that our
naval programme was to procure a
naval force greater than that of Ger
many. He further said:
"In all sections of the country the
conviction, rightly or wrongly held, is
firm that the present occupant of the
White House is apt to involve us in war
with some other nation."
Referring to a statement of Admiral
Dewey that the sea force should con
sist of forty-eight battleships, Fitzger
ald said that confirmed his assertion
that the r.aval programme was based
on the theory that our navy should be
larger than that of Germany. It was
time to call a halt on much talk of an
inflammatory character that was heard
throughout this land, declared Fitz
terald, adding: â¢Public officers are the
chief offenders by loose, indefinite and
bombastic statements. The Naval Com
mittee in its report is not entirely free
from the disease."
Referring to the speech by Secretary
Moody and that of Bede of Minneapolis
concerning the Monroe doctrine, Fitz
gerald said President Cleveland never
would have issued his "universally
praised Venezuelan message" if he had
stopped to measure the relative
etrength of the navies of the two coun-
TriÂ«-s. In conclusion he asked: "'Are we
to have a great navy merely to furnish
fjir.mcr holidays that high officers may
pia> at v.ar?"
Foss. speaking for the bill, said the

SAT BERRTS
FIRED FIRST
Millionaire Dewey and His
Cowboys, Wilson and Mc-
Bride. Outline Their Defense
ARMY OFFICERS TESTIFY
Promise Is Made to Show the
AYeapon of One of the Victims
"Was Filled After Shooting
KANSAS CITY, Feb. 19. â A special
to the Star from Norton, Kans., says:
State Senator Hessin, attorney for
Chauncey Dewey and his two cow
boys, McBride and Wilson, to-day told
the defendant's "side of the shooting
affray at the Berry ranch on June 30
last, when three members of the Ber
ry family were shot down, and began
the introduction of the testimony, the
defense's first witness being General
Wilder S. Metcalf, former major of
the Twentieth Kansas Volunteers and
nÂ«\T pension agent at Topeka. Pre
viously Judge Geiger had overruled
motions to discharge Wilson, Dewey
and McBride.
Senator Hessin. in his narrative- of
the battle, asserted that the Berrys
had fired the first shou It would be
shown, he said, that on the day of the
fight Dewey, McBride and WilPon had
gone to the Berry place to take away
a water tank they had bought. The
three Berry boys walked across the
yard with their hands uuon their re
volvers. Chauncey Dewey called out
to them to stop where they were and
the three Berrys drew their revolv
ers and fired.
"Then." asserted Attorney Hessin,
"our men fired, and not until then.
Our men acted in self-defense. Burch
Berry, instead of shooting only once,
emptied his revolver. We will show
that the revolver Burch Berry carried
was not only replaced in its holster
after his death, but we will make it
plain that it was reloaded and that
the barrel was cleaned, but whoever
cleaned the barrel forgot to clean the
chambers and it now shows evidences
of the gunDowder from its discharge
on that fatal day."
General Melcalf, Colonel Ward C.
Little of the Twentieth Kansas and
Captain Claud Hamilton, -who had
fought with Wilson in tire Spanish
war. testified as to that defendant's
good character and bravery. C. W.
Birch of Salina, a brother of Justice
Birch of the State Supreme Court,
also testified as to Wilson's good char
acter.
While the trial was in progress to
day the Sheriff of Norton County ar
rested seven other Dewey cowboys
â¢who were with Dewey on the day the
shooting of the Berrys occurred and
who are in town as witnesses for the
defense. The men arrested were each
served with three Justice warrants
from Cheyenne County for the killing:
of Burch Berry, Daniel P. Berry and
Alphus Berry, making twenty-one
warrants for murder.
Judge Gefger immediately- issued an
order that the men should not be re
moved from Norton until they were
allowed to testify in the present trial.
They were released on $1000 bail each.
BOIXIXGER CASE WILL
GO TO SUPREME COURT
An Appeal Will Be Taken From the
Superior Court of Santa Clara
County.
SAN JOSE. Feb.na. â The Bollinger
will contest, which has been before the
courts for four years, is to be carried
to the Supreme Court. In December
the heirs of Mary A. L. Bollinger, the
widow of Christian Bollinger. received
a verdict at the hands of Judge Hy
land in their favor. The contest was
brought against George Y. Bollinger,
a son of the testator, to have a lot of
property, valued at about $100,000, re
ceived from his father juÂ«t before his
death, declared community property.
It was claimed that George Y. Bol
linger by undue influence had secured
the property from his father. The
brothers and sisters of George Y. Bol
linger were left with practically noth
ing. By the decision rendered some
$50,000 worth of property held by
George Y. Bollinger was declared the
property of the estate of Christian
Bollinger. The estate of Mary L. Pul
lan, one of the heirs, was given judg
ment for an undivided one-fifth in
terest of the Quivey ranch and also
a one-fifth interest of the Bascom tract
and an undivided one-fifth interest in
several notes, aggregating $500, and
also that he holds in trust for such
executors the sum of $10,649. An ap
peal is to be taken by George Y. Bol
linger from this part of the judgment.
The matter will be held on March 5.
There is a large array of legal talent
in the case and as about four years
have been occupied in its trial in the
lower court the case promises to be in
the Supreme Court for a long time.
HEIRS TO BATTLE
FOR THE LULL ESTATE
San Francisco Attorney Charged With
Having Used Undue Influence
on Testator.
SAN JOSE, Feb. 19. â An opposi
tion to the probate of the will of the
late James Lull has been filed in the
Superior Court by Mrs. Sarah H. Tru
man and Mrs. Maria A. Platt, sisters
of the deceased. Lull died in Novem
ber last, leaving an estate in this coun
ty valued at $7000. It consists prin
cipally of notes and mortgages. Lull
devised his estate to Mrv. James Lull,
a divorced wife; two daughters and a
granddaughter of Attorney E. A.
Bridgeford of San Francisco and sev
eral others.
The *Â»ntestants assert that Lull. left
no other relatives but themselves and
that they are the sole heirs at law.
They declare that their brother was
of unsound mind and utterly incom
petent to make a will or care for his
property and that the will filed for
probate was secured by means of un
due influence of E. A. Bridgeford. It
is stated that the latter had acquired
complete control of Lull. It is recited
that Lull's father left him $7000 in
trust and that Bridgeford made re
peated efforts to induce the heirs to
break the trust, and, failing in this,
he worked on Lull until he had him
execute the will in question.

Japan Will Respect
the Neutrality of
V_> 1 1 1 1 i CX â¢
TOKIO. Feb. 19. â Captain Kurakami,
commander of the Japanese armored
ship Chiyoda, to-day presented the
Emperor with the shot-torn flags of
the Russian cruisers Variag and Ko
reitz, which were sunk at Chemulpo
on February 'J. , The Emperor was
much affected. He congratulated Kura
kami and made him the bearer of an
affectionate message to the officers
and men of the fleet.
The response of Japan to the request
of China for a statement of its position
in regard to the neutrality of the latter
country was made public to-dav. Its
text is as follows:
"The Imperial Government, desiring
to avoid as far as possible a disturb
ance of the peaceful cc-ndition of affairs
which prevails in China, will in all
parts of Chinese territory, excepting
the regions now occupied by Russia,
respect the neutrality of China, so long
as Russia does the same.
"The rules of war which govern the
forces of Japan in the field do not
permit the wanton destruction cf prop
erty. Accordingly, the Imperial Chi
nese Government may rest assured that
the mausoleums and palaces at Muk
den and Hslngking and public build
ings in China everywhere will be se
cure from any injury not attributable
to the action of Russia.
"Furthermore, the rights of Chinese
officials and inhabitants within the
zone of military operations will, in their
persons and property, be fully respected
and protected by the imperial forces,
so far as military necessity permits.
In the event, however, that they should
extend aid and comfort to the enemy
of Japan the Imperial Government re
serves to itself the right to take such
action as circumstances require,
"It remains only to say in conclusion
that the present war is not being waged
by Japan for the purpose of conquest,
but solely in defense of her legitimate
rights and interests, and consequently
that the Imperial Government has no
intention to acquire territory at the
expense of China as a result of the con
flict. .
"The Japanese Government also wishes
the Imperial Chinese Government 1 to
clearly understand that whatever ac
tion may be taken by it on Chinese
territory, which is made the theater of
â war, will be the result of military
necessity, and not in impairment of
Chinese sovereignty."

Cossacks Crossing

Chinese Endeavor
to Attack the
Muscovite.
LONDON. Feb. 20. â Complete stagna
tion in war news leads the newspapers
this morning to discuss the political as
pect of the struggle in the Far East as
they are likely to affect Great Britain.
No great importance is attached to the
stories published in Paris and elsewhere
on the Continent *of alleged intrigues
looking to the coalition of Russia,
France and Germany, the belief being
that it is to the Interest of all the
powers to take steps to localize the
struggle.
At the same time It is recognized that
in all three of these countries there Is
a strong feeling against Great Britain
on account of her alliance with Japan;
and as Germany and France joined
with Russia in .1S95 against Japan, it
would be natural for Russia to. seek
similar assistance in her present diffi
culties. The argument is therefore
made that it behooves Great Britain
to be prepared for any and all results.
News of the abolition of the Russian
censorship has not yet reached the
English newspapers.
Russian dispatches to the London
press record the rapid growth of Anglo
fphobic feeling. According to the Kiev
correspondent of the Standard, many
Englierh boys have been withdrawn
from Russian schools owing to the an
noyance and insults to which they were
subjected and there. Is evidence in the
restaurants and other public resorts
that the position of British residents In
Kiev would be dangerous should Great
Britain become involved in the Russo-
Japanese struggle.
The Tientsin correspondent of the
Daily Mail supplies a new version of
the loss of the Russian cruiser Boy
arin. obtained from an officer who sur
vived the blowing up of ihe Russian
torpedo transport Yenisei. This offi
cer says that on the day following the
Yenisei's catastrophe. February 12, a
violent storm brought many mines to
the surface of the water at Port Ar
thur. The Boyarin was sent to assist
in securing them, but she was caught
in the storm, was driven on the rocks
and sunk. If tb'.s account is correct
it explains the Russian official denials
that the Boyarin was torpedoed by the
Japanese or that she was blown up as
a result of accidental contact with a
Russian mine at Port Arthur.
The Shanghai correspondent of the
Daily Express asserted that after an
interview with the Japanese Consul at
Shanghai the captain of the Russian
gunboat Mandjur consented to disarm
his vessel and to keep it in the harbor
of Shanghai until the conclusion of
hostilities. â¢
The correspondent at Seoul of the
Daily .Mail reports that 1500 Cossacks
are crossing the Yalu River into Korea
near Wiju and that â¢Cossack scouts
have already advanced^ into Korea as
far as Anju.
Cable dispatches from Shanghai de
clare that General Ma. who is protect
ing the borders of Pechili province,

NOTED CONVERT
TO THE MORMON
CREED IS DEAD
SALT LAKE, Utah, Feb. 19.â Mrs.
Sarah C. Bigler, known and beloved by
all Mormons as "Saint Sarah," is dead
at Plymouth, -Box Elder County, Utah,
at the age of 98. General decline, due
to old age, was the .cause of death.
"Saint Sarah" was one of the earliest
converts to the religion founded by Jo
seph Smith and sire passed through all
the persecutions that attended the
early days of the Mormon church." She
was a great friend of the prophet, Jo
seph Smith, and twice she saved his
life. Once, in Jackson County, Mis
souri, when a mob was seeking his life
Mrs. Bigler secreted him in her house
and disguising him in her own clothing
enabled him to escape. Later, when
Joseph Smith and his brother were
forced to flee for their lives from Kirt
land, Ohio, hotly pursued by men bent
on killing them, "Saint Sarah" led the
mob on a false lead and thus aided the
Mormon leaders to make their escape.
At the time of the killing of. Joseph
Smith and his brother in the Carthage
Jail "Saint Sarah" was living In the
Mormon city of Nauvoo, Illinois, and
with the- other Mormons was driven
from her home by the mobs. In com
pany with the Brigham Young expedi
tion she crossed the plains to the new
Zion in the valley of the Great Salt
Lake.

Wheat Is Boominq
as Result of
Conflict.
Excitement Reigns
in Chicago
: Market.
CHICAGO, Feb. 19.â In the midst of
excitement 'unequaled on Change since
the days of the Leiter deal in 1898, the
price of wheat for May delivery
touched $1 OS to-day. This record price,
the third highest in the history of grain
speculation in Chicago in the last twen
ty years, was reached within fifteen
minutes after the big gong on the floor
of the exchange announced the opening
of the day's business.
At the opening May wheat sold at
$1 and $1 01, and touched $f 03, but a
moment later the price had fallen into
two figures again, but the relapse was
only temporary, and almost Instantly
the price with a single bound reached
the mark of $1 01V&.
Toward the close of the session May
wheat again gathered strength as a
result of heavy buying and made an
other spectacular jump, touching $1 03.
A slight reaction followed this effort
and the price fell off to $1 02^, at which
point it was at the close of business.
The rise in price is partly the cause
and In part a result of a similar condi
tion in England and on the Continent.
The conflict in the Far East and belli
cose rumors from the Balkans, with
a rumor that the great powers may
forsake their pacific attitude and be
come involved in one or the other of
tKese wars, are all responsible in vary
ing degrees for the existing high prices.
In 1891 wheat for May delivery sold
at $1 OS, and In 1898 Lefter forced the
price to $1.S5.
Corn and oats were affected by wheat
strength, but in a less notable degree.
DEXIES THAT THE FRAUDS
WERE COMMITTED BY WOMEN*
"WASHINGTON, Feb. 19. â Former
Congressman John L. Shafroth of Colo
rado, who resigned his seat because of
election frauds in Denver, denies that
the frauds were committed mainly by
women. In an interview to-day
Shafroth said:
"Of the persons implicated, very few
were women; not more than one in ten
at the outside. The frauds were com
mitted in the lowest part of Denver,
where not many women live. The inci
dent was not characteristic of the
women's voting in Colorado, and it is
preposterous to make It an argument
against female suffrage. Everybody
knows there are bad women, as well
as bad men. but what would any good
man think if it were proposed to take
his vote away from him because a few
bad men somewhere had cheated at an
election? In Colorado the women vote
as generally as the men, and fraud Is
much rarer among them. As a rule
their election methods are honorable,
and the influence of woman's suffrage
on the State has been distinctly for
good."

INSURANCE CO31PAXIES
WILL LOSE $31,000,000
BALTIMORE, Md., Feb. 19.â The
Baltimore Underwriter, in Its issue to
morrow, -will print the losses of all the
fire insurance companies in the Bal
timore fire. The total gross loss is
$32,S64,800, of which $6,000,000 falls
on the local companies. The estimat
ed total salvage is $1,769,700, which
leaves a net loss to the insurance com
panies of $31,095,100. It has been
learned that many of the large whole
sale dry g-oods houses formed an In
surance pool among themselves, which
amounted to about $5,000,000, from
which practically nothing will be re
alized. Another development is that
very few of the tenants of the so
called fireproof buildings carried any
insurance.

the contention of excessive bail by re

PLANING MILL
SWEPT BY FIRE
Plant of the Loma Prieta Com

stroved at an Early Hour
PH0BABLE LOSS IS $50,000
Flames Spread Very Kapidly,
and Several Residences in
Ticinity Have Narrow Escape
SANTA CRUZ, Feb. 19.â The Loma
Prieta Planing Mill was burned early
this morning. The loss will approxi
mate probably $50,000.
The fire broke out in the boiler-room
about 2:30 o'clock and, although the
flre department responded promptly, it
was impossible to save any part of the
plant. The principal losers are the
Loma Prieta Lumber Company, of
which A. C. Bassett of Menlo Park is
president, W. R. Porter of "Watsonville
secretary and Directors Timothy Hop
kins and T. B. Bishop of San Fran
cisco.
â The fire spread rapidly, the flames
shooting heavenward and illuminating
the neighborhood. The buildings
burned covered over an acre of space,
and with the sheds and lumber yard
added nearly an acre more. The plan
ing mill proper, with galvanized iron
annex, the long surface lumber sheds,
the old Centennial flour mill, the office,
stable and warehouse were all swept
away.-
The fire was discovered by the night
watchman. John Majors, who was eat
ing his lunch in the office. Majors was
first attracted by a light and. looking
out, he saw flames issuing from the
roof Just above the boilers.
Good work was done in keeping the
flames from spreading through the
lumber yard which adjoins the South
ern Pacific depot.
Three residences on Beach Hill
caught fire on the roof from falling
cinders, but the blazes were extin
guished. The windows of Sunshine
Villa, the home of ex-Lieutenant Gov

SHIP DRIFTS
NEAR ROCKS
Unknown Vessel Narrowly Es
capes Destruction Near the
Cliff House During" Heavy Fog:
BURNS DISTRESS SIGNALS
Spreckels* Tag Relief Is Sent
to Rescue and Tows the En
dangered Craft Intd Port
An unknown three-masted, square
rigged vessel, inward bound, fired sev
eial blue rockets as a signal of distress
off Mile Rock at about 1:30 o'clock this
morning.
The Spreckels Tugboat Company im
mediately sent a tug to rescue the ves
sel and her crew should there be any
immediate danger of her destruction.
The live-saving station also launched a
lifeboat.
Owing to the dense fog that prevailed
in the vicinity of the distressed ship
it was impossible to ascertain her
name, but it is believed that she may
be one of the following vessels
that are due to arrive at this port:
Bark Annie Johnson. Honolulu; George
Curtis, Honolulu; British ship Hale
wood. Antwerp; American ship S. B.
Carleton. Newcastle, or the ship Henry
Failing, from Newcastle.
Though these vessels are all expected
to arrive at any time, it is more than
likely that the vessel that signaled for
aid last night Is the Annie Johnson,
which closely answers the description.
It later developed that the vessel was
making port under her own sail, and
that When directly off Mile Rock the
wind died out, leaving her helpless and
at the mercy of the tide that rapidly
swung her toward the rocks.
While in this predicament the vessel
signaled for assistance, but fortunately
before she grounded the wind came t^Â»
her aid and she was enabled to tack
before any damage had been done.
The Spreckels tug Relief was the
first to reach the vessel and towed her
safely into port.

WATER COMPANY
DEMAND VETOED
Mayor Sclimitz Refuses to Ap
prove rnitcmized Bills Pre
sented by i4ie Spring: Valley
XO KATE IS SET FOKTII
Corporation Must Be Satisfied
Without Pay or Jeopardize
Its Injunction Proceedings
Mayor Schmitz has vetoed the bills
lor the Spring Valley Water Company
for supplying water to the public
buildings and hydrants during the
month of January. The" bill for sup
plying the public buildings amounts to
$1166 t>5 and the hydrant bill is
S804S. Both of the bills were ordered
paid hy th e Board of Supervisors by
special resolution despite the fact that
neither of the bills was based on a le
pal water rate and neither of them
was itemized.
Mayor Sclimitz in vetoing the Spring
Valley's bills acts largely on the ad
vice of Bpedal Assistant City Engineer
Russell L. Dunn, representing the
Board of Publi/ Works and assisting
the Board of :/jpervisors m the fixing
of water rates. Dunn has investigated
the water bills and finds that they do
not comply with the city ordinance
and Ihe charter regarding the presen- j
tation of demands on the city and -
county of San Francisco for payment.
En a portion of his report to the Mayor j
Dunn says:
Tne Quantity of water furnished any one of '
tht public buildings is not Fpecifled: there is i
no rate of charge for the water yi>eclfie<i; j
neither the till nor the affidavit of Chief CW-rk .
George E. Booker, which Is attached, states or I
indicates how much water, if any â or that any j
definite aniouul of water was actually fur- ]
nisheeJ or Uf-^-d in f^ai.l jiublic buildings or in ;
Â»ny of them. Not Wing specially advised. I ,

gist irouses. luive flat rates.
BILLS IMPROPERLY MADE.
Tht b!H â bcoM show three faits, which it
does not show:
K;:tt â The cuar.tities of water furnished
each building.
Hecondâ The rates at r.-hich furnished.
Third â The law or ordinance authorizing the
Eiine.
Concerning these matters, the affidavit of
George E. Booker, chief cluk cf the Spring
Valley \VatÂ«r Company, attached to said bill,
dfcciarp* "ihat the water therein tpecllM has
beeÂ£, actually furmEhfd and the charges made
ht tne lowest current rate and the proper and
true value of the same.
The veto of the Mayor places the
Spring Valley in a peculiar predica
ment. If it is forced to make a flat
rate to the city it cannot base it on
the rate fixed for the present fiscal
year, for such a move would be a prac
tical admission that the rate now being
contested in the Supreme Court is a
just one. and would be the means of
throwing out of the court the case of
the Spring Valley against the people
of San Franciscc-, in which an injunc
tion was issued against the Supervisors
in the matter of the rate for the fiscal
year of 1003-04. Neither can the com
pany fix the rate hisher than the one [
now being contested and keep within ,
the Jaw of the ordinance and charter i
on the Question of water rates.
It seems in the light of the ordinance
and section of the charter covering the
question of water rates that the Spring
Valley will not be able to legally col
lect the amounts demanded of the city
in the two bills presented.
REFERS TO THi: CHARTER.
Dunn in his report to the Mayor re
fers to the law and cases of a similar
nature decided in the courts. The ref
erences are as follows:

THE SAM FRANCISCO CALL., SATURDAY. FEBRUARY 20, 1904.
SPRING TRADE
IS DEPRESSED
Midwinter Conditions Inter- j
fere With Commercial Activi- j
ties Generally in the East j
NEW YORK. Feb. 19.â Brad- |
street's weekly review of trade to-mor
row will say:
Midwinter conditions are a bar to
growth in spring trade and interfere
greatly with transportation and out
door activities generally. Still a fair
Increase of business is noted in jobbing
circles at leading- Western and South
western centers and the best week's
Jobbing business so far this year is
reported'at leading Eastern markets.
The feeling is that while spring trade
will be later than .a year ago this
drawback can be largely offset if good
weather supervenes later. While fav
orable to some lines, notably coal and
heavy winter wearing apparel, the
general effect of the unbroken cold
weather upon industry is" hot favor
; able. Important failures are - more
numerous this week, some banks and
insurance companies, the latter at
Baltimore, contributing largely. Money
has tended to harden slightly.
' WAR HAVING EFFECT.
War .'nfluences cut a large figure in
the course of prices, which with few
exceptions has been upward. Flour,
wheat, corn, oats and pork all made
new hich records, those of wheat and
flour being the highest reached since
1898, and tea, butter, tin and copper
also advanced. Cotton and coffee were
conspicuous exceptions to the general
advance, but this was due to a contin
uance of the liquidation under way for
some time past, and pig iron weakened
as the result of backward demand, en
larging production and reported in
creasing stocks.
Trade is still rather quiet on the
Pacific Coast, though good rains in
California and expected large business
with Alaska help the outlook.
R. G. Dun & Co.'s Weekly Review of
Trade says.: â¢ â¢
Inclement weather alone prevents a
revival of. business! Outside work is
retarded and traffic impeded to an ex
tent that cannot be accurately meas
ured, but is obviously sufficient to neu
tralize the favorable effect of many
encouraging factors, while winter
wheat is threatened, although not yet
definitely injured, and early farm
preparations must be postponed. Sev
eral leading branches of manufacture
are increased in active capacity and
thousands of interior buyers are plac
ing partial orders at the principal cit
ies. The temporary advantages of the
war are felt in the market for stapie
commodities, notably foodstuffs, but
while this helps the domestic producer
it harms a much larger number by
enhancing prices to home consumers.
. RAILAVAY. EARNINGS FAIK.
There is little friction between em
ployers and wage earners. Despite in
terruptions by storms railway earnings
thus far reported for February were
only 4 per cent smaller than a year
ago: when' there was 'so much severe
weather, j Foreign trade returns for'
the last week at this port show an In
crease of $1,152,012 in value of ex
ports as compared with' last year, but
imports were Blightly smaller. . Finan
cial conditions are satisfactory, money
remaining easy and foreign exchange
undisturbed by the complications
abroad. Foreign .trade started the
new year most satisfactorily, as shown
by official returns for the month of
January. Two' factors contributed to
swell the value of exports, prepara
tions for war in the Orient and high
prices for farm staples.
Liabilities of commercial failures
thus far reported for February aggre
gate $5,344,692, of which $2, 004, 911
were in manufacturing, $2,515,179 In
trading and $824,602 In other commer
cial lines. For the same period last
year liabilities were $6,364,285. Fail
ures this week .number 287 in the
United States, against 247 last year,
and 20 in Canada, compared with 26
a year ago. . . â¢â  V.

FORSAKES HOME
FOR THE STAGE
Pretty Clio Allen of Seattle,
Whose Disappearance Started
a Scandal, Is at^ the Grand
HAS BEEN HERE A WEEK
Confesses Her Love for a Mar
ried Man, Who, She Says, Will
Aid Her in Her Only Ambition
Miss Cljo Allen, an attractive miss,
just entering on her eighteenth year
and a belle of the fashionable society
of Seattle, where she was reared in the
midst of all the luxury that a family
of means could \ afford her, is quietly
lodged at the Grand Hotel, in this -city,
awaiting the subsidence of a storm of
scandal that recently broke around her,
as a result of her sudden disappearance
from that city.
, She forsook the sheltering roof of her
mother's home in Seattle on Friday
last, went to the leading hotel of the
town, where she remained for a night,
and then hastened to this city. The
day after her disappearance the re
markable story of her youthful and
probably - foolish ambitions and love
for a married man, who has since
openly confessed that this love Is
mutual, and that he purposes to finan
cially aid her, set Seattle society agog
and has since been the main topic of
discussion there.
Miss Clio Allen is a pretty type of
woman, shapely and fair and strongly
imbued with the thought of future
histrionic success. It was her ambition
to shine before the mello.w footlights
that Incurred for her the displeasure of
her mother, and It was the sympathy
extended to her by Frank H. Kilbourne,
a prominent business man of Seattle,
in the midst of her trouble at home,
that were, according to her own "admis
sions made last evening, responsible
for her sudden flight from the north
to this city. '
Her name has been associated In a
disagreeable way with that of Kil
bourne, who has a wife and several
children, and is Miss Allen's senior by
nearly forty years. Kilbourne's daugh
ter and Miss Allen were chums and this
girlish association led to acquaintance
with the father. Just how long ago
Kilbourne became deeply Interested in
Miss Allen's -welfare is not known, but
it developed that when the girl left
her home, last Friday evening, she was
assisted in getting apartments for the
night at the Northern. Hotel by Kil
bourne, and he aided her in getting out
of town on the following day. He has
since admitted that he not only loves
Miss Allen, but is contemplating the
future when he will secure a divorce
from his present wife and marry the
girl, who is now in this city. Miss
Allen Coolly discussed her case last
evening.
"My father has been dead for some
years," said she, in a rather indifferent
way. "He left a good fortune, a share
of which is now due me. I have always
been anxious to make my own way in
the world, and I first conceived the
idea of becoming a professional nurse.
Later, when I realized that I had a
fairly good face, an attractive form
and a voice that would improve with
culture, 1 determined to go on the
stage. " I have intelligence, courage and
patier.re and have long been' confident
that If I could' receive the necessary
instruction -I would -achieve success as
an actress If not as a' songstress.. My
ambitions have not met with the favor
of my mother, and finally I decided to
leave home. I went to Mr. Kilbourne
and asked him Jo assist me and he
agreed to. Friday afternoon I quietly
departed from our home and over night
was secreted in the Northern Hotel.
Kilbourne only acted as any man would
toward a girl with whom he is in love.
He has been separated from his family
for some time. We love each other,
and I do not fear to confess it. I have
always been a good girl and will strive
to be so in the future. Many of the
malicious lies that have been circu
lated about Kilbourne and myself ema
nated from a - young fellow in Seattle
who is also in love with me. I have
come to San Francisco to remain and
within a few days I hope to enter a
dramatic school for my preparatory ed
ucation for the stage. To-day, when I
learned of the anxiety in Seattle over
my whereabouts, I promptly tele
graphed to my sister and I have re
ceived a reply from her this evening."
For. several days the detectives of
this city have been on the lookout for
Miss Allen, but they seemingly did not
suspect that she was at the Grand Ho
tel, where her signature was boldly in
scribed on the register and where she
has remained the greater part of the
time she has been in the city. ;

I NEW HAVEN, Conn., Feb. 19.â The
university, presidents and professors
who are attending the annual conven
tion of the Association of American
Universities to-day discussed "The
Actual and Proper Lines of Distinction
Between College and University
Work." Papers by President Arthur
T. Had ley of Yale and President Jor
dan of Leland Stanford University
were read. . . â 
President Jordan said there were
reasons vvvhy there should be no ab
rupt change from the American-col
lege to the university, but on the other
hand many reasons why, the educa
tional system should be one of grad
ual'transition. The university should
radiate from the; college, extending In
every direction "work already begun.
It should not be a separate school with
different sympathies and methods su
perimposed upon the college.

RAISE THE TEMPERATURE
OF A HAMMAM SHEBANG
Presidio Saloon-Keeper and His Military Escort Have Hot
'Time in the Bathsâ Henry Miller Wrecks Saloon of Su
pervisor Alpersâ Judge Cabaniss Dons Wings of Cupid
There was a hot time in the Post
street. Hamman Baths Thursday night
and the torrldity was not confined to
the hot room. Tony Phillips, a Pre
sidio saloon-keeper; Anthony Feamer,
a gallant . soldier, and another boy in
blue, who 'escaped the restraining, arm
of the law, taking his name along 'with
him, .started in to warm up all the
apartments of the establishment. The
timely arrival of Policemen George
Collins and. Bob; Connors prevented
the temperature from reaching the
danger mark. *~
Phillips and his military escort, all
strongly under the influence of liquor,
invaded the baths and went through
all the processes that are offered there
for the cleanliness of body and re
habilitation of nerves after a debauch.
Every time they tried something new
and found their jags depleted they re
plenished the deficiency from the side
board which is maintained for that
purpose. Caviar sandwiches, cold
chicken and beef broth were also
found to be on sale and of these they
partook unsparingly.
Along in. the morning hours, when
most of the wicked cease from
troubling and the weary are at rest in
a Hammam bath, Phillips and the two
soldiers, properly keyed up with their
libations, , began to sing "My Own
United States." Somebody from a cot
shouted, "Shut up, you' bums!" where
at the spirit of Phillips was troubled.
Clad only in a breech cloth and a grim
look he hunted up the manager and
demanded his â¢ revolver so that he
could steam up the gentleman who
had asked for silence.
The manager refused to give .him
the weapon until . he was . ready to
leave. After an argument Phillips and
his companions dressed and their ef
fects were turned over to them. Phil
lips refused to pay the bill, because
he said he had been badly treated, and
the soldiers couldn't pay because they
were a few. white chips shy of having
any money at all. One of them sought
the cool night air, but the other stuck
by the saloon-keeper until the arrival
of the policemen. Both men were
taken Into custody and before Judge
Mogan yesterday were called upon to
answer* to charges of defrauding an
innkeeper. An additional charge of
carrying concealed weapons was
placed against Phillips.
F. E. Williams, manager of the
baths, told of the delightful time the
defendants had enjoyed at his expense
and the arresting officers related what
they knew of the matter. The de
fendants asked that they be given un
til February 24 to present their cases.
Henry Miller, a baker, played his
credit to the limit in the saloon of Su
pervisor George Alpers Thursday night
and when refused further accommoda
tions in the way of foaming schooners
of steam beer went outside and nearly
wrecked the place. -The bartender
climbed under the icechest until the
bombardment was over and then made
a survey of the damage. He found
that every window in the front of the
saloon had been reduced to fragments.
Miller was given six months in 'the
County Jail yesterday by Judge Con-
Ian.
Charles Stone Is a knowing English
man, who cares little for the restric
tions or laws of this country. Thurs
day night he visited Chinatown and
attempted to go Into the alley on the
Sullivan estate, where white men are
not allowed. George Downey, the
watchman, courteously informed him
that it was private property and not
open for inspection. Stone said he
wanted to go where other persons were
not allowed and he had to be escorted
out forcibly. Then he stood at the en
trance to the premises and abused the
watchman. *
A large crowd congregated to listen
to his diatribe and a member of the
Chinatown squad placed him under
arrest. He was found guilty of dis
turbing the peace yesterday by Judge
Fritz and fined $5 or twenty-four
hours in jail. He chose the jail sen
tence.
Judge Cabaniss is an effective, if
rather angular, Cupid. Yesterday he
joined in wedlock a youthful couple in
a peculiarly original way. The groom
was George W. Porch, who is only 19
years of age, and the bride was Clara
Partier, one year his junior.
The groom had great difficulty in se
curing a license. Both of his parents
are dead and he has no legal guardian.
The license clerk construed the law
liberally under the circumstances and
recognized the policeman who had the
lad in custody as "one having legal
charge of him." Some of the police fur
nished the money for the license fee.
The couple were married In Judge
Cabaniss' chambers. The eminent jur
ist sat on a table while the happy
pair occupied the only two chairs and
carefully avoided looking at one an
other. The customary questions were
put and answered and the pronounce
ment was made that they were hus
band and wife. "All marriages are not

Edward Mulrooney, past grand presi
dent of the Horseshoe Club, the com
modious quarters of which are located
on the Petaluma and Washington
street wharves, was given six months
in the County Jail by Judge Mogan
yesterday for vagrancy.
The badge of the Horseshoe Club 13
a tin can pendant to a string and the
motto is, "We don't need no foam on
ours." The club's quarters are on the
two wharves where empty beer barrels
are landed from interior points. All
beer that doesn't go through the spig
ot belongs to the Horseshoe Club by
right of sequestration. When Deputy
Sheriff Holland was a water front de

T. J. Wilson, who was arrested Tues
day night while he was chasing pedes
trians along Mission street with a
knife, was before Judge Mogan yester
day and was convicted of disturbing
the peace.
"What did you mean," asked the
Judge, "by running after persons with
a knife?" â 'â¢>'-.
"I was looking for a man who hit
me, and if I had found him there
wouldn't have been' anything to it,"
answered the defendant.
"Have you ever been arrested be
fore?" asked the Judge.
"Yes," answered the defendant. "I
was arrested for throwing a .rock
through a window once. A fellow
wouldn't give me anything to eat, so
I took a smash at him through the
window."
The Judge ordered Wilson to be
taken out to the Insanity Commission
ers for examination, saying: "If they
don't confine him, I will. I think he
is a dangerous man to be at large."
John G. Patterson, an employe of
Nolan's livery stable, who washed a
colored boy's face with a sponge soaked
with a solution of - caustic soda with
the expressed intention of making him
white, was convicted yesterday In Judge
Conlan's court of cruelty to a minor
child and ordered to appear for sen
tence to-day. The incident occurred
Monday, but the marks of the burns
were still visible- on the boy's face
when he appeared â¢ to testify against
his , cruel tormentor. , His . father and
two policemen told of the sufferings of
the little fellow at the time he received
the injuries.
John McKenney was convicted of bat
tery in Judge Fritz's court yesterday,
although he pleaded that the battered
man, a Mission street saloon-keeper
named Patrick McDonough. deserved
what was coming to him for having
failed to exercise the traditional tact
and delicacy that is the heritage of all
Irishmen. â¢
McKenney owed McDonough 50 cents,
and when McKenney went Into the lat
ter's saloon McDonough bowled him
out before a large gathering, instead of
taking him quietly into the burglar
proof vault and asking him for the
money. .. â 
"Na backlish," said McKenney.
"Draw me a sharp steam." While Mc-
Donough bent to the task with a
schooner in one hand and the spigot
In the other McKinney took a good,
long swing and landed on his creditor's
eye. It swelled so rapidly that only half
the usual crowd were able to get into
the saloon during the rest of the even
ing. McKenney will be sentenced to
day.
Frank Hamilton was before Judge
Fritz yesterday on "a charge of va
grancy and was given a three days'
liquor cure. If he appears sober in the
City Prison Monday morning when the
drunks are discharged then he will be
dismissed. His wife, who caused his
arrest, pleaded for him. She said he
was the best man in the world If he
would let drink alone.
Niccola Ivanovich, a 16-year-old boy,
was arrested yesterday morning for
stealing The Calls of a number of sub
scribers from their doorsteps on Green
street. This Is a form of theft pecu
liarly annoying to patrons and pub
lishers, and there is so much of it going
on that whenever one of the thieves is
apprehended an example should be
made of him. Detection is exceedingly,
difficult, because a paper Is easily con
cealed and the larceny can be accom
plished so rapidly that it is scarcely no
ticeable.
Ivanovich has been in the United
States only a few months and cannot
speak English, which is an additional
reason why he should be taught a
wholesome lesson }n regard to property
rights. His case was before Judge Mo
gan yesterday, but a continuance was
granted at the request of defendant's
counsel until next Wednesday.

Secretary of Agriculture to
Extend Belief to Owners of
the Sheep on Kodiac Island
Sz>ecls.l Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 19.â The Presi
dent has commissioned George F.
Beales as Postmaster at Visalia, ,
Charles E. Cosgrave at Challenge and
William F. Holmes at Kellogg, Cal.
The House passed a bill to-day grant
ing to Port Angeles, Wash., for
park purposes certain portions of the
Government reserve near the city.
Senator Foster has been assured by
the Secretary of Agriculture that a
modification of the game regulation of
Alaska will ' be made to protect the
sheep on Kodiac Island. The Frye
23ruehn Packing Company of Seattle
recently complained that big bears on
the island were killing off large num
bers of their sheep and that as a re
sult a dozen or more bears also had
been killed. The employes of the com
pany were arrested for a violation of
the Alaska game lawp, and the matter
was placed tx-fore the Secretary of Ag
riculture, who has jurisdiction in the
premises in so far as the regulations
are concerned.
Secretary Wilson says: "The depart
ment has no desire' to have the bears
protected at the expense of the sheep
owners, but believes that under tha
existing laws regulations may be made,
by extending the open season, which
.will relieve the present difficulty. The
department is now preparing a modi
fication of the regulations covering this
poinr to take effect at an early date,
and hopes at the same time to meet
the other objections which have been
raised against the law. The act of
June 1, 1902. wns purposely made elas
tic to meet conditions as they might
arise and a change in the regulations
affords a more expeditious method of
relieving the situations described vban
an amendment of the law itself."

Miss Nellie Murnane, a young woman
employed in the â¢tarpet department at
the Emporium, committed suicide
Thursday night through grief over the
less of her intended husband, who died
of consumption on Thursday afternoon.
Connected with the tragedy is the
story of a woman's uhtiring devotion
to a man In the clutches of an incur
able disease. "When her lover passed
away the woman thought life not worth
living and scarcely half a day after
his death 6he retired to her room,
turned on the gas and died.
The man to whom Miss Murnane was
to have been married was Clinton War
ren, an engineer, residing at 205 Hyde
street. Warren. had been sick for some
time, and during the laBt three months
had been confined to his bed. Miss
Murnane formerly resided with her sis
ter. Miss May Murnane, who conducts
a rooming-house at S27 Eddy street.
About six weeks ago, when Warren be
gan to waste away, she mdved to thÂ»
Maryland; an apartment-house at 299
Hyde street, that she might be near to
her fiance.
When she had finished her work Miss
Murnane was wont to visit Warren and
nurse him. Her devotion was untiring
and she did not seem to realize that
the man she was to wed was doomed.
Just before his death the young woman
wanted to have the ceremony per
formed, but was deterred by her sister,
who realized that Warren could not
live.
HER GRIEF WAS PITIFUL.
Thursday afternoon Warren died. Miss
Murnane was summoned from her work
and her grief was pitiful. She was not
allowed to see the body at the house
and later in the evening went with her
sister to the undertaking parlors where
it lay. The undertakers asked her to
wait until the morning to see the
corpse, as the body was too wasted to
gaze upon. Miss Murnane insisted, but
was finally persuaded by her sister to
wait. The two went to a restaurant
and procured something to eat. At the
table Nellie Murnane told her sister
that she was despondent and was go
ing to take her own life. After con
siderable persuasion she promised not
to take any such course, and when she
left her sister at 9:30 o'clock to go to
her room in the Maryland she seemed
to have abandoned all desire to end
her life and her sister left feeling that
she would not carry out her threat.
Yesterday morning landlord Fulmar
Carlton and his wife smelled gas and
on opening the door of Miss Murnane's
room discovered the j'oung woman lying
in bed with a rubber tube leading from
the gas jet into her mouth. The win
dows were wide open, but the gas re
mained in the room. The suicide was
deliberately planned, and when Dr.
Pcole was summoned by the landlord
life was extinct. The Coroner was no
tified, but by the request of friends of
the dead girl the corpse was not taken
to the Morgue, But was removed to a
local undertaking establishment.
May V. Murnane. the sister of the
dead girl, stated- that her sister was of
an exceedingly morose and melancholy
disposition and on several other oc
casions had threatened to take her life.
She was of such a disposition that any
little trouble affected her deeply, caus
ing her to talk of committing suicide.
Nellie Murnane was 33 years of age
and a native of Virginia City, Nev.,
where her mother and father reside.
They have been sent for and will ar
rive In time for the funeral.
Warren, the dead woman's Intended
husband, was about 40 years of age
and was formerly employed as an en
gineer at the Pacific Planing Mill, on
Berry street, near . Fifth. He was a
member of the Stationary Engineers'
Union and will be buried under the
auspices of that organization.
GIHI/S MYSTERIOUS DEATH.
Miss Annie Rohde, a Danish girl,
aged 25 years, was found dead from
gas asphyxiation in her room at tho
Grand Southern Hotel, Seventh and
Mission streets, yesterday morning.
Whether her death was due to accident
or suicide has not been determined.
The stopcock on one of the gas Jets
vas found turned partly on and the
room was filled with the deadly fumes"
of gas.
Miss Rohde, who had lived in the
house fx>r some time, entered her room
last niyHit in company with a young
man. This was about 9 o'clock. No one
saw the man Jeave her room, but the
landlady, Mrs. Anvassie, thinks that It
was late.
Yesterday morning at 8 d'clock the
employer of Miss Rohde, E. Weinberg,
a tailor of 49 McAllister street, sent
Fred Cousins, his office boy, to the
Grand Southern to ascertain why Miss
Rohde did not show up for work.
Cousins met the bedmaker, Mrs. J. W.
Butcher, and the two went to the young 1
woman's room. Miss Rohde was found
lying on the floor partly dressed, not
yet dead. The ambulance was sum
moned, but before it reached the place
the girl's life was gone.

Oregon Physician Champions
; Alcohol as Stimulant to the
Progress of the Human Race
PORTLAND, Or., Feb. 19.â A defense
of alcohol by Dr. Woods Hutchison,
secretary of the State Board of Health,
has created a sensation in temperance
and other reform circles in this city.
Addressing the State Conference of
Charities and Corrections Dr. Hutchi
son said:
Two elements are necessary in race progress,
one the survival of the â¢ fittest, the other the
elimination of the unfit. Th* influence of
alcohol on the race Is both ancient and pro
found. Two thlncs stand out clearly about it,
one that It is absolutely universal in every
aÂ«e of the world and in every stage of civiliza
tion. The other is that races pass through
certain definite stages of reaction to It. First,
one is of fres reaction and the prevalence of
drunkenness. After a time an equilibrium is
obtained and the race becomes relatively sober.
The nations of Southern Europe, the Greeks,
the Spaniards and the Italians, for example,
through continued consumption of alcohol,
have gradually attained a level of comparative
sobriety. To-day those races which are In
the van of progress and are the dominant
factors In the world's work â the . American,
the English, including the Irish and Scotch,
and the North German â are those In whom
drunkenness Is mest ramtiant. â¢
Those races which are contributing little to
the advance, the modern Greeks, the South
Italians and the Spaniards, are practically
sober, while those which are absolutely stag
nant â the Arabs, the Hindoos and the Chinese
â are entirely so. Alcoholism Is an index of
racial Instability and its chief action is that
of eliminator of the unfit.
Most of the theories advanced by Dr.
Hutchison met with emphatic disap
proval of his hearers.

KESWICK. Feb. 19. â The affidavits

in the case of the United States against
the Mountain Copper Company of
Keswick.
Suit was brought by the Govern
ment several years ago to abate the
nuisance created by the smoke from
the smelter. The company's stand
.has been that all the damage that
could be done to trees and vegetation
has been done long ago. It is and has
been ready to pay the Government for
all timber destroyed within a pre
scribed area.
Th# intent of the affidavits now be
ing taken is to show that the area of
damaged timber and vegetation is be
ing extended. The Happy Valley
ranchers are making affidavits that
crops and orchards are now being
damaged by smoke that were never
affected before. The valley is .ten

Cortege Passes Through the
Streets to Lakeview Cemetery
CLEVELAND, O., Feb. 19.â The last
rites over the body of Senator Marcus
A. Hanna were r held this afternoon at
St. Paul's Episcopal Church. During
this solemn occasion Cleveland was si
lent. Nearly all business was suspend
ed. Street railways and steam road
traffic on every line in the city was
stopped for .five minutes, from 1 to 1:05
o'clock. People generally in all parts
of the city bowed their heads in rever
ence for a brief space of time* at that
hour.
Thousands who were unable to view
the remains of the dead Senator as
they lay in state in the Chamber of
Commerce auditorium yesterday and
flocked to the church doors to
witness the conveying of the black cas
ket, bearing the remains of. the Sena
tor, Into the church. They stood there
with bared heads and moistened eyes
as the cortege moved into the edifice,
where the last earthly tribute was paid
the. dead.
Promptly at. noon the funeral cortege i
left the Chamber of Commerce build- j
ing, preceded by a platoon of police, for J
the church. â¢ '
Following the police came Troop A >
as gukrd of honor. Then came car- j
rlages'containing the pall-bearers, the
Washington delegation, the. Governor's |
staff. Chamber of Commerce commit- j
tee, Loyal Legion committee and dele- I
gations representing various civic soci- .
eties. ;
Prior to the removal of the body j
from the Chamber of Commerce to the
church the wealth of floral offerings
which were banked about the audito
rium were removed to- the church.
There they were placed near the ch:.n
cel. !
Admittance to the services at .the i
church was by card and limited to S00, j
the seating capacity of the auditorium. I
Reservations on the center aisles were j
made for the family, the Governor's j
staff, the Washington delegation and !
other distinguished guests. The church j
was filled long before the hour for the J
services to commence and thousands t
lined the streets about the edifice.
MEET BODY AT CHr^CH DOOR.
A few moments before 1 o'clock Mrs.
Hanna, accompanied by her son Daniel,
entered the church. She was dressed in i
deep black and was heavily veiled. Oth- j
er members^. of- the- family followed.
After a moment's . waiting the light j
tramp of feet and voices of clergy an- j
nounced the presence in the building of r
the body of the dead. The clergy met [
the body at the entrance, and as they !
preceded it up the aisle recited the \
usual sentences. The pallbearers who :
carried the remains were Governor j
Herrick, Judge W. B. Sanders, Andrew ,
Squier, J. B. Serbe, C. A. Grasselli, .A. j
B. Hough, W. J. McKinie arid Samuel i
Mather.
When the body had been placed oh
the bier and the pallbearers seated the I
choir chanted the thirteenth and nine- j
) teenth psalms. President Pierce of
Gambiep College, an institution of
which Mr. Hanna was a benefactor, J
read the lesson, which was First Corin
thians, fifteenth chapter, from the
twentieth verse to the end of the chap
ter. The choir, under the direction of
Professor C. E. Clemens, then sang the
hymn "Lead, Kindly Light."
TRIBUTE TO THE DEAD.
Bishop Leonard then delivered the
eulogy, speaking as follows:
We are gathered together here to-day In this
house of God for the last service of benedic
tion over the body of our distinguished citizen,
our kindly neighbor and our beloved friend.
The nation has honored him with Its clvlo
function at the capital of the United States:
the Commonwealth of Ohio, by the hands of
her Governor, has received him back into her
care and keeping, and the city has stood si
lently about his bier, reverencing his memory
and sorrowing at his departure. And now the
holy church would commit his body to tho
earth whence It came and his soul unto thÂ«
righteous Savior who redeemed It and who
loved it with an infinite affection.
It Is not the time or plnce for extended eu
logy and praise; such words will be. fitly
spoken by those well equipped for such a privi
lege. But there are certain qualities and char
acteristics of this man highly regarded by
all classes of people that ought assuredly to
receive recognition in the midst of his friends
and associates, and at this solemn hour the
testimonies that have been given from many
and varied, sources blend together In a common
strain and harmony as they speak of his high
integrity, of his Inflexible and dauntless pur
pose, and his tender, truo heart. .
Those who are assembled here need no In
spiration for their love for this earnest, helpful
life. ,We knew him well, we loved him wd!l,
we mourn for him with undlmlnlshed sorrow,
but we shall , see his face no more. But we
may each of us go forth Into the life God
hath granted us with added enthusiasm for our
tasks since we have noted how earnestly he
did his duty for others; and we realize that
the world Jjjs served is not unmindful of his
greatness and goodness, nor ungrateful for
what hÂ« strove after and for what he accom
plished.
FAIR IX ALL HIS DEALINGS.
And first, the universal comment Is upon his
integrity. This was a keynote in his life-
I recall a fine, ringing address he made nt
Kenyon College last year when the degrees
were beinc conferred upon its graduating
class. And t>>e thought of .his heart found
expression in his eloquent words as Ke urged
upon these men the .essential Importance of
high and pure integrity. It is this word that
Is carved deen ut>on the stone that marks his
long and uR.-ful business career. He was not
only honfst. but he was fair and Just In all
his dealings. â¢ He was respected by every one
In hln emnloy. tCach man of the hundreds
that looked up to him felt that In the master
mind there was always the clear, unshak
able light of integrity. His field was an q\Â»:n
one and his methods were never belittling or
degrading. Though the arrows fly swiftly,
yet do they fall . from such a shield harm
lessly, and the champion sustained by his in
tegrity stands forth unscathed and triumphant
at last. He Is an examDle to the young men
of our conntrv who would achieve success In
any department of endeavor. And his advice
is a legacy, to the ardent youth ot our great
republic. â  â¢ .
Then, too. he was a purposeful man. He
had definite objects In his life. He had alms
to achieve, goals to reach, standards to at
tain, la he -not conspicuous In this?
The choir sang the hymn "Forever
With the Lord, Amen, So Let It Be."
Dr. G. H, McGrew, rector of St
Paul's Church, followed with the creed
and prayer. The anthem, "I Heard a
Voice From Heaven," was sung by the
choir. â 
BODY PLACED IX A CRYPT.
Bishop Leonard then read the com
mittal service and pronounced the
benediction. ' The body, only accom
panied by the family and pallbearers
and Bishop Leonard, proceeded slowly
out Euclid avenue to Lakeview Ceme
tery, where a final farewell of the dead
was taken in Wade Memorial 'â Chapel.
The .services consisted "simply- -.of a'
prayer by the Bishop. :. The body '.was
â¢deposited in a crypt in the chapel to

family.
On the way to the cemetery two
striking marks of respect were shown
the dead Senator. At Adelbert College
the students drew up in line in front of
Hatch Library and /Stood with un
covered heads as the cortege passed.
Again at the Euclid-avenue car. barns,
near the entrance of the cemetery,
several hundred employes were drawn
up in line and, with bared heads, paid
their last respects to the dead.
Just as dawn began to break over the
city to-day the doors of the Chamber
of Commerce auditorium, where the
bedy lav, were reopened to a vast throng
of people, who desired to view the face
of the dead Senator. The long lines of
people stretched away until they-ex
ceeded In length the five blocks reached
during yesterday afternoon.
At 10 o'clock the members of the State
Legislature, who recently chose. Mr.
Hanna to represent the commonwealth
of Ohio iiythe United States Senate to
succeed Himself, drove from their hotel
to the Chamber of Commerce in a body
and looked for a last time upon the
face of the dead statesman.
During the night many distinguished
men of the country arrived in Cleve
land to attend the funeral service, and
the early morning hours of to-day
greatly augmented that number. The
Washington delegation arrived at 10:30
o'clock. and was at once driven to the
Hollenden Hotel. The party comprised
Secretary Taft of the War Department,
Secretary Wilson of the Agricultural
Department, Secretary Cortelyou of the
Commerce and Labor Department,
Commissioner Garfleld, chief of the bu
reau of corporations in the Department
of Commerce and Labor: Senators For
aker, Perkins, Warren. Fairbanks,
Scott, Beveridge, Kittredge, Cockrell,
Martin and McEnery. They were ac
companied by the secretary of the Sen
ate, Charles C. Bennett; B. W. Lay ton.

NEWS OF THE COUNTY OF ALAMEDA
CLAIMS FIANCE
DEFRAUDED HER
Anna Welter Alleges That
George M. Varrelle Procured
All Her Money by Deception
SAYS HE TOOK HUNDREDS
Asserts That She Gave Him
Her Savings to Start in Busi
ness, but He Squandered It
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1118 Broadway, Feb. 19.
George M. Varrelle, formerly em
ployed as a coachman by Frank M.
Wilson of Berkeley, is charged with
having dissipated the savings of a
woman who loved him and whom he
had promised to marry, in entertaining
new acquaintances and making himself
a "good fellow" generally. When the
money was gone Varrelle, it is claimed,
attempted to borrow more, and this led
to an investigation, which proved that
the money he had been spending so
lavishly had been entrusted to him by
Miss Anna Welter, who it is alleged had
given Varrelle her savings of more than
two years, amounting to nearly $400. in
order that he might go into business
for himself, instead of which he spent
the money. He then left town, it is
said, but forgot to leave his address.
Miss Welter, who is now in the em
ploy of Mrs. H. E. Wise of 1350 Madison
street, says she first met Varelle when
the was employed by Frank M. Wilson
of Berkeley. When Varrelle first went
to work for Mr. Wilson he told Miss
Welter that he was an expert elec
trician, but had taken his present posi
tion because he could not get work at
his trade. Two weeks later, the girl
says, he asked her to become his wife
and she consented. It was only a few
days later, she says, that Varrelle told
her that he had a chance to take a
contract to wire a building in Fruit
vale, but did not have the necessary
money to supply a bond. He asked her
to advance him the funds, which she
says she did, but instead of taking any
contract he came to Oakland and en
gaged a room at the Hawthorne House,
at Thirteenth and Washington streets.
It is claimed that he told the landlady,
Mrs. M. Peacock, that he was a cattle
owner from Phoenix, Ariz., and that
he had recently sold a large shipment
of cattle to the Russian oGvernment.
As the money of which it is claimed
he defrauded Miss Welter began to
give out he tried to borrow small sums
from friends whose acquaintance he
had made while masquerading as a cat
tle owner. In one or two cases it is said
be was successful, one of his alleged
victims being Dr. Winning of the Bos
ton Dental Company, and another the
housekeeper employed at the Haw
thorne House.
As a last resort it is said that he tried
to obtain credit at the First National
Bank on the pretense that he had an
account at a bank in Berkeley. He
failed to get any money, however, and
he left the city. To some of his ac
quaintances he said that he had been a
member of Roosevelt's Rough Riders,
and he exhibited a Rough Rider medal.

They Will Be Circulated in
the City for Signatures

of Charles H. Spear, president of the
State Board of Harbor Commission
ers, had their inning last evening In
this city, when a number of them met
and passed a series of resolutions in

There has been a bitter fight on for
some weeks against Mr. Spear, which
apparently came from this city. It
took the form of a long address, widely

Mr. Spear's friends got together last
night and adopted the following reso
lutions, and then decided to put them

erally by the citizens of Mr. Spear's
home town. Among those who attend
ed this meeting were Town Trustees
Christian Hoff and Thomas Dowd, C.
D. Maloney, former Superintendent of
Streets; Otto Niehaus' and many others.

WOMAN ESCAPES
FROM PROWLERS
Berkeley Office San Francisco Call,
214S Center Street. Feb. 19.
Mrs. Mamie Murphy of Third and
Gtlman streets answered a knock at her
kitchen door at 8 o'clock last night, and
opened it upon two rough-looking
characters. They assumed a threaten
ing attitude and demanded something
of her, whether . money or bread she
was too frightened to% find out. She
retained enough of her self-possession,
however, to outwit the would-be rob
bers.
"My purse is In the next room," she
said, summoning all her courage; "wait
a minute and I'll get it for you."
' She got her purse, but she didn't go
back to hand it to the men. Instead
she ran out the front door and across
lot? to the California Ink Works, a
block away, to get her husband, James
J. Murphy, who is an engineer in the
manufactury.
Mr. Murphy heard the breathless
story and hurried to the house, in com
pany with his wife and Oliver Parquet,
a fellow workman. The men had pis
tols, and when they reached the back
door leveled them at the two men," who
were still standing there, waiting for
Mrs. Murphy to come out.
The men threw up their hands at the
command of the irate husband and
made no attempt to resist. They dis
claimed any Intention to rob Mrs. Mur
phy, saying that they had simply asked
her for something to eat. It Is sup
posed that the men are the same who
have been loitering in th. neighborhood
for several days.
RAILWAY MAY TAKE
POSSESSION OF LAND
OAKLAND, Feb. 19. â The Southern
Pacific was given the right by Judge
Ogden to-day to enter into posses
sion of a block of land bound
ed by Kirkham, Fifth and Cy
press streets. The land was award
ed to the company for $4000 by
n. jury in condemnation proceedings.
The decision was appealed from by
Gretchen Feldman and her children
and their attorney made an endeavor
to keep the railway out of possession
until the case had been decided by the
Supreme Court.
The railway needs the land for the
establishment of its. new freight yards
and secured all the property In the
vicinity of this particular piece of
land. The company was made to place
J1000 in the hands of the County Clerk
to indemnify the Feldmans in case of
a reversal and in the meantime it will
go right on with the improvement of
its property. ,
OAKLAND, Feb. 19. â Judga Ogden
to-day denied the petition of thÂ»
Emeryville Savings Bank to change its
name to the Security Savings Bank of
Berkeley upon the showing of the Se
curity Savings Bank and Trust Com
pany of Oakland that the similarity of
names would cause confusion.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, FEBRUARY "20; 190*.
MAGNIFICENT WORKS OF ART
WILL HANG IN FOURTH SALON
Annual Exhibit of Starr King Fraternity Opens' Saturday Evening
at Wendte Hall, and Though Some Pictures Were Damaged
in Collision, Six Days' Display Promises to Be Brilliant
OAKLAND, Feb. 19.â The fourth an
nual art exhibit of the Starr King
Fraternity will open next Saturday
evening with a blaze of glory,
notwithstanding the accident that came
so near being disastrous to the plans
of all concerned. Few know that when
the driver of one of Gump's wagons
was struck by a train last week he
was on his way to Wendte Hall with
some of the choicest pictures loaned
for the coming art exhibit. Some were
damaged irreparably, but a few were
rescued without a scar and will take
their places as planned in the salon.
The much-talked-of painting by Jo
seph Greenebaum, "La Priere," which
was hung in the Paris salon and which
the artist brought with him on his re
turn recently from Europe, was in the
wreck, but, barring a small scratch
in one corner, was not damaged.
WILL LAST SIX DAYS.
The art exhibit will, as usual, con
tinue for six days, beginning Satur
day evening, February 20, with a re
ception to the patrons and^ exhibiting
artists, and closing Friday evening,
February 26. Admission on the open
ing night will be by invitation only.
The exhibition will come up to its
usual high standard, as only the best
out of the hundreds of canvases sent
for approval have been selected and
such well-known artists as Keith,
Cadenasso, Yelland, Piazzoni, Martinez,
Judson, Yard, Gamble, Seawell, Dixon,
Rollins, Griffin and Nielson will be
represented in some of their happiest
work. Miss Margaret Herrick, who is
exhibiting for the first time, has sev
eral delightful pictures on display.
Aside from its intrinsic merit, Miss
Herrick's work will be viewed with
added interest from the fact that she
is an Oakland girl, being a sister of
Mrs. Mark Requa and also of that tal
ented artist, Mrs. Mary Herrick Ross.
Douglas Tllden, Putnam and Ger
trude Boyle will represent California
sculptors. MisÂ»s Boyle's life-size bust
of Dr. J. K. McLean of this city is one
of the best things that very clever
young woman has done. All the fine
characteristics of Dr. McLean's benev
olent countenance have been carefully
brought out and his numerous friends
will study with interest this latest suc
cess of the young sculptor. '
MIXIATUUE EXHIBITS.
Among the miniature artists who will
exhibit are Miss Laura Prather, Miss
O'Ryan of San Francisco, Oscar
Kunath and Madame Rosa Hooper
Plotner. Miss Prather's miniature of
her mother, Mrs. W. L. Prather, and
of Mrs. H. C. Taft are said to be very
fine.
Saturday evening there will be a
musical programme under the direction
of Miss Pauline Collins, including solos
by Mrs. Carrie Brown Dexter and
Lowell Redfleld and selections by the
Orpheus Club Quartet. The reception
committee will include the art fund
trustees. Mr.; and Mrs. Arthur Brown,

AWARDS CHICO
PLANT STATION
Bureau at Washington De
cides Upon .That Fertile
.Valley Region for Garden
SETTLES FATE OF OTHERS
Selects the Locality' Because
of Its Good Soil,. Abundant
Water and Equable Climate
Berkeley Office San Francisco Call,
2148 Center street. Feb. 19.
Word was received at the agricultural
college of the University of California
to-day that the bureau of plant intro
duction of the United States Depart
ment of Agriculture had decided upon
Chlco as the place for locating the plant
introduction garden that has been so
long talked of. This will be something
of a boon to ChiÂ«o and in fact the
whole northern portion of the State, for
the Government means to spend a large
amount of money on the tract of land
it will settle upon.
This award at last settles the fate of
the large number of agricultural dis
tricts of the State that had put forth
claims for consideration by the plant
introduction bureau. Boards of trader
and other commercial bodies all over
the State advertised their communities
before the bureau and various influ
ences were brought to bear in behalf of
them. Professor A. V. Stubenrauch and
J. H. Dorset, representing the bureau,
spent a good deal of time visiting the
places and then two weeks ago went to
Washington to confer with the heads
of the department, with the result that
Chlco is now announced to be the win
ner.
Chico was selected because of its uni
formly good soil surface, its abundance
of water and Its typically representa
tive California climate. It is at ths
northern end of a great valley and in
the center of one of the largest con
tinuous agricultural strips in the world.
Two tracts have been picked out in the
valley for the gardens and one of these
will be turned into the plant introduc
tion garden.
Santa Clara was next in the consid
eration of the committee of selection,
but its uncertain water supply and
variable climate on account of prox
imity to the coast counted against it.
In addition to the Chico garden there
will be a branch garden at Santa Ana,
which will be used for the semi-trop
ical cultures. The tract has not yet
been selected, as in the case of Chico.
This plant introduction garden will
be the only one of its kind in the United
States. It will be used to grow plants
of all kinds for distribution all over
the United States.

STRAIGHTEN OUT
JUNIOR MIX-UP
Berkeley Office San Francisco Call,
2148 Center street. Feb. 19.
All the fuss that was stirred up over
an illegal vote at the election for presi
dent of the junior class at the Univer
sity of California was smoothed out to
day when the election committee de
cided that another election would be
called and Miss Flora Frickstad elect
ed to the office. That is considered
the easiest way out of the entangle
ment and everybody concerned is
satisfied with the arrangement.
According to the agreement the
committee will suggest at the junior
meeting next Wednesday that the of
fice of president be declared vacant.
Then Miss Frickstad will be nomi
nated to the office and unanimously
elected.
"Both Miss Frickstad and Miss Nel
lie McCarthy, the contestants for the
office, are agreeable to this arrange
ment," said W. C. Crittenden, the pres
ent class president, to-day. "Miss Mc-
Carthy does not want the office with a
cloud hanging over it and neither does
Miss Frickstad. As Miss Frickstad
got the highest vote at the election
and Miss McCarthy has declined to
run again it was decided to elect Miss
Frickstad to the office."
The junior class officers deprecate
vigorously the statements that fraud
was practiced intentionally. They say
that the mix-up was merely the result
of a student prank.
CHILDREN SAVE
PARENTS' LOVE
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1118 Brodway, Feb. 19.
The home of Albert and Bertha Hen
nig, which f was threatened with de
struction in the divorce courts, was
saved to-day by the two children of the
pair. The disposition of the children
brought the parents together this
morning, and the joy of their offspring
in seeing them once . more together
caused the estranged husband and wife
to forget their personal complaints, and
they concluded the session by appear
ing before Judge. Ogden and asking
that the action be dismissed.
.Hennig Is in the employ of the South
ern Pacific Company, and brought the
suit against his wife on account of tales
told him by his neighbors of his wife's
behavior with other men. These, she
proved, had no foundation, and upon
her part she was willing to acknowl
edge that her charges of cruelty
against him were not of such a serious
character that she could not forget and
for give them. The Judge made the or
der forthwith.
LABORER PARADA BLOWS V
HIS HEAD OFF WITH. GUN
Despondent Man Wanders to Lonely
Spot East of Sunol nnd Terribly
Mansles Himself.
OAKLAND, Feb. 19.â M. Parada, a
laborer, aged 27 years, blew his head
off with a shotgun yesterday afternoon

uty Coroner Detjen of Pleasanton the
suicide left Sunol early in the morn
ing ostensibly on a hunting trip. That
is the last seen of him alive. His
friends say he was suffering for the
last few weeks from melancholia and
had threatened to do away with him
self.
There is no indication of foul play.
The inquest will be' held Monday at

LENTEN SEASON
Catholic Churches Bear Testi
niony to Faithful Obedience
of Archbishop's Instructions
THOSE THAT AKE EXEMPT
Kestrictions Imposed Do Not
Visit Hardships in the Matter
of Abstinence From Food
Since the inauguration of Lent last
Wednesday there has been a marked
observance of the season by the Ro
man Catholics of San Francisco. Many
that are exempt from the fasting ob
ligation are voluntarily depriving
themselves of unnecessary gastronomi
cÂ»l indulgence and the restriction of
frivolity is apparent in the decreased
attendance at all kinds Â«f public en
tertainments. The churches are daily
visited by large numbers of worship
ers.
Archbishop Riordan's instructions
to the faithful excurc from fasting
a!l persons under 21 years or ovor 60
years of age; those that are engaged in
hard labor, th* sick and convalescent
and those that cannot fast without in-
Jury to their health. Workingmen
and their families are allowed the use
of flesh meat once a day, except on Fri
days, Ash Wednesday and the Wednes
day and Saturday or Holy Week.
Those that are exempt from the ob
ligation of fasting are permitted to use
meat more than ome a day on all
days except those before mentioned;
but those that avail themselves of this
indulgence are not permitted to use
flesh meat and f\<\\ at the same meal
end are exhorted to perform some
other act <i* mortification, such as ab
stinence from intoxicating liquors.
In addition to the usual Sunday de
votions Lenten exercises are held on
two eveningrs of each nveek in all the
churches of the archdiocese to which
ere attached resident pastors. On one
of the evenings an instruction is given;
on the other the stations of the cross,
and permission is given for benedic
tion of the blessed sacrament on both
evenings. On Good Friday the de
votion of the way of the cross will
be given twice in all parish churches,
once during the afternoon nnd then
eÂ£-n:r. in the evening. The afternoon
Rerviee is for the children, though
grown people, especially the old. and
those that cannot attend in the even
ings, are not excluded from it. The
Fervice in the afternoon will not begin
before 3:30 o'clock, thus giving chil
dren time to reach the church after
th*Â» closing of the schools.
. The Archbishop strongly recom
.mpnds that wherever it is possible the
children be brought to their respective
parish churches every Friday after
noon during the Lenten season for the
devotion of the way of the cross and
a short sermon relating to the passion
of Our Lord.
The exercises Good Friday (April
3 5) will consist of the stations of the
cross, with the singing in English' of
a ve.rse of the "Stabat Mater" between
gad) station: a short sermon on the
passion and death of Our Lord and the
reading of prayers. On Holy Thurs
day the services at the cathedra! will
begin at 10 a. m.

PACIFIC TRADE
IS ITS THEME
Commercial Museum Supplies
Facts of Live Interest Con
cerning 1 Countries Now at War
3IANUFACTURES OF JAPAN
Demand of Siberia for Foreign
Goods Is Considered With
Details of Local Value
The Pacific Commercial Museum has
inaugurated a new plan to convey to
its membership information relative to
the latest happenings concerning for
eign trade movements in the countries
bordering . on the Pacific Ocean. A
monthly review of the trade is to be
given in a bulletin, which is really an
eight-page periodical. It is compiled
and edited by Eugene Goodwin, direc
tor of the museum. The first number
of the bulletin is Just out.
A share of the contents of the ini
tial number if? devoted to facts con
cerning industrial enterprises in Japan.
The information is timely, as it throws
light on the progress of the sturdy lit
tle brown men whu are now facing
the Russians. One statement is that
one-third of the total imports into
Manchuria is composed of cotton cloth
made in Japan. The hemp industry in
Japan has received especial attention
and orders were recently executed for
a supply of fishing nets for Alaska
to cost $30,000. There are four hemp
spinning companies In Japan, besides
which spinning is carried on as a
household industry in the northern
provinces, and these sources supply
fully the domestic demand for ail
grades, except bleached hemp yarn,
which Japanese manufacturers have
not the means for producing. Flax is
freely raised in Japan, but the impor
tation of flax, hemp, jute and China
grass during the first six months of
1903 amounted to "22" tons, about 2000
tons in excess of the amount imported
in the corresponding period in the pre
ceding year.
The Japanese Government has a
scheme for subsidizing a company to
train workmen to manufacture plate
glass. The plan calls for the appro
priation of $249,000 to be expended dur
ing the next four years. It is pur
pc-sed to choose a foreign expert and
to construct two furnaces of the latest
style under his supervision, each with
a capacity of at least 470,400 square
feet of plate glass a month; also to em
ploy thirty foreigners as trainers of
Japanese workmen, and to train fifty
workmen for the Government service.
An Osaka firm of sugar dealers is
preparing to establish a sugar refining
plant, and a company is reported to
have dispatched representatives to the
United States and to Europe to pur
chase machinery. A company of na
tives of Yezzo also purposes to import
American machinery to manufacture
condensed milk.
Some valuable information Is also
supplied by the bulletin relative to the
foreign trade of Siberia, which may
largely concern San Francisco as an
exporting point. The following para
graphs are illustrative:
The extensive territory lyinjr #ast of I^ake
Baikal contains 10,0<Xi,00<> inhabitants, .who are
:-. fui-.-.g prnirreso in . ctvi!!zat!cn and whese
warts are on the increase. The introducUon
ct European manufactures is maneged through
native house*. All the cities of Importance of
Eastern Siberia have for years had large com
nwrfal fcoutes/ Germany his alreadv gained
a firm foothold In tlies* markets and km a
monopoly pf the trade In most artlc!Â»8. En&
l>h exoorts to Eactem Siberia consist prin
cipally of cooJ. tinned sheet iron for roofing.
nails and other metal poods. On account of
the discontinuance of the free harbor at Vlad

of 1&02 the English Import* of fancy, and
textile eoodr. ais well as of preserved food
artie!fÂ«. sardine?, milk. etc.. which were
specialties of English trade, have preatly de
c:ea*ed.
The bÂ»Â»t opportunity for the operations of
American manufacturers is in the introduction
of machinery and implements for minln?. The
principal demand at present In for machinery
foi coal mines. Coal minim? in Siberia is yet
in iti> infancy, but as th* Fupply of wood for

est is being shown by the citizens and
the people who are here from other
parts of the State. The attendance is

RED CROSS TEA
THE AFFAIR OF
THE AFTERNOON
By Sally Sharp.
To-day the benefit tea at Mrs. Low
enberg's. 1650 California street, will
take precedence over matinees, bridge
whist and even the alluring teas that
are on the cards for the afternoon. The
hours are from 3 to 6 o'clock, and the
beneficiaries the Jackies of the navy.
"Going?" To be sure! Who would not
gladly go down in her automobile bag
for a dollar for the dear little Jackiesâ
the young sailor lads that are learning
the defense of our country. Mrs. Bow
man McCalla, Mrs. Frederick Sbarboro,
Mrs. Arthur Cornwall and a bevy of
other patriotic women are working to
provide a clubhouse for them, where
they will be surrounded with beneficent
influences rather than those of the
grogshop. The Red Cross Society, of
which Mrs. John Merrill and Mrs. Har
rington are leading figures, has taken
up its share of the burden, hence the
benefit tea to-day at Mrs. Lowenberg's
charming homeâ tickets $1. A pro
gramme of merit will be presented
which alone will be worth the money.
As an indication of the interest mani
fested in the project it is satisfactory
to note that the following good people
have furnished rooms in the clubhouse:
General Horace Binny Sargent, a dor
mitory; L. R. Vance, Miss Sarah Mc-
Calla, Admiral McCalla, Mrs. .Walter
English, Chauncey English, Mrs. John
T. Porter, Leo Oulton, Mrs. Andrew J.
Welch, Dr. Harry Tevis, the estate, of
A. A.. Sargent. Mrs. James M. Goeway,
Mrs. William Tevis, the young William
Tevlses and Mason Wittney Matthew.
All of these have provided furniture
for rooms. And is not that a testimo
nial of good citizenship? prac
tical patriotism. .
As a help toward the work an . ex
cursion is planned for Washington's
birthday about the bay for the purpose
of witnessing the torpedo-boat practice,
directly and incidentally of collecting a
dollar per for the fund. -.The Southern
Pacific has generously given the Berke
ley for the affair, while Mr. Foster has
donated the Donahue-rthe latter to
carry no more than 300 at $3 per head,
luncheon to. be served gratis. The3e
excursions promise to be delightful af
fairsâas promising socially as well as
financially. " '";"' "â¢">â ".â '

thing! "Going?" To be sure. ,. .

TAKES ADVICE
FROM SPIRITS
Fritz Salmon Buys Oil Stock
and , Patent Medicine After
Hearing From Deceased Sister
NOW WANTS MONEY BACK
Files Suit Against Medium
Earle, Alleging That Latter
Imposed Upon His Credulity
Spiritualism, oil stock and patent
medicine; figure in a suit for damages
filed yesterday" by Fritz Salmon against
Edward Earle. According . to the . com
plaint I Earl, in â¢ his capacity of stock
broker, medium and dispenser of patent
medicine at $10 a bottle, induced the
plaintiff | to invest â¢ part of his bank
account. Salmon says Earle got $520 out
of. him, and he asks the. court to give
him judgment for that amount.
The plaintiff says that in February,
lOOl.i Earle told him that the stock of
the Hecla Oil Company was a valuable
asset and advised him to purchase a
block. of it. Earle, Salmon claims, veri
fied . his â  statements a. few evenings
later, when in his capacity of medium
he produced: a slate message from the
plaintiffs sister, Lizzie, telling him to
buy the stock. . Salmon followed the ad
vice, purchasing $250 worth of the
stock. A week or- so later he again
purchased $250 worth of stock on the
strength of a message received from
JLizzie and transmitted to him on a
slate by Earle.
Some time later, after he had received
various .'letters from Earle telling him
that the Hecla Oil Company was boom
ing, the plaintiff alleges he consulted
Earle about Tiis health. The latter, he
says, informed him that he knew of a
medicine that would work wonders
with a sick man; He bought a bottle,
paying Earle $10 for it, for the. latter
told him that he alone knew where, to
get it. A few days later he bought an
other bottle, for, he says, one night
Earle gave him a message from one Dr.
Oscar Schmidt, a deceased friend, tell
ing him not to be without the medicine.
The message also told him that "no
drug store had it in stock," so, as in the
first instance, he turned the $10 over to
Earle.
Now he says that the medicine was
never worth $10 or any portion of it.
; and that the stock of the Hecla CJil
Company is not worth the paper it is
printed on.

L. Bleakmore. to whom Dr. E. A.

INSTRUCTIVE STUDIES

WOMEN
Railroads' Damages.
BY EARL, D. BHRHT
IKorm^r Railroad Editor New York Sun and
New York Time?.]
(GorrriSfat, 15*04. by Joseph B. Bowles.)
An expert railway statistician esti
mates that not less than $73,000,000 is
paid out annually by the railroad com
panies In the Tnited States to satisfy
claims for personal damages and fa
talities. Although the percentage of in-
Jury to life and limb through railroad
operation has materially lessened with
in tti*> last decad<*, the scope and work
Â«if the claim department on each road
has steadily increased. In oases where
passengers are killed or injured and
wherein injury and loss are inflicted
upon persons residing along the line of
the" road the proportion of pecuniary
satisfaction demanded is. now much
higher than ever before.
The growing popular disposition to
"make the railroad company pay" for
the damage it does has had its most re
cent illustration in the suits brought
against the Â»w York Central Railroad
by the victims of the terrible Park
avenue tunnel disaster in New York
City a little more than two years ago.
By a rear end collision in the tunnel
just above the Grand Central station
many persons were killed and others
were frightfully mangled. It was a
suburban commuters' train, and som-?
of the victims were persons of wealth
and social prominence. The railroad
company was scored bitterly for not
having proper lights and signals In the
tunnel, and suits for personal damages
ranging from $JO00 to $100,000 were
brought against the company. Judg
ments for large amounts such as $45.
000, $00,000 and $75,000 were gTanted by
the courts, and the company's attor
neys bent all their efforts toward pri
vate settlements with the scores of
claimants. Only a few weeks ago a
semi-official announcement was made
that all of these claims had been paid,
including the Judgments, and that the
aggregate sum in which the New York
C< ntral had been mulcted amounted to
about $3,000,000. It Is a matter of fact
that the company scarcely put in a de
fense as against the Park avenue disas
ter claimant". Passengers on the ill
fated train received from $500 to $2000
for bruises and "shock." and torn
clothing was paid for on the most lib
eral scale.
This latest experience of the New
York Central is in marked contrast
\vith a "smash-up" incident on the old
Boston and Albany road before the
Civil War. Two clumsy, slow moving
trains made an attempt to pass on the
same track, with the usual result.
Passengers were severely shaken up
and badly scared, but there were no
fatalities. The morning after the ac
cident a farmer limped into the office
of the general superintendent and said
in a menacing tone: "Mr. Superintend
ent. I came to see what you are going
to give me for shaking me up yester
day ?"
The railroad official sized his man
up and observed that he was damaged
more or less in both body and habili
ment. He asked the- farmer how
much he thought he ought to have as
compensation for his injuries. The
answer was: "Well. sir. I think it is
worth 50 cents, and I will settle for
that amount."
The superintendent handed out the
half dollar, quietly remarking that it
was a large sum. but inasmuch as the
farmer seemed to be an honest man
the company would pay it. Then as
an additional evidence of liberality the
superintendent offered to give his
caller a pass on the railroad as far as
his home. "No you won't," said the
farmer as he moved toward the door.
"As long as these old legs of mine last
I won't go on your darned railroad
any more."
Nowadays public sentiment ap
parently justifies the stiffest kind of
claims for damages inflicted by a rail
road company. A serious railroad ac
cident arouses popular resentment,
chiefly for the reason that modern in
vention has placed practically perfect
safety appliances at the disposal of the
railroads. While the Interstate Com
merce Commission reports from year
to year a diminution of the number of
lives lost on railroads, the most har
rowing railway catastrophes occur
periodically and almost in -every in
etance investigation discloses as the
cause recklessness, disregard of rules
or rank incompetence on the part of
some employe. Frequently safety ap
pliances fail to Vork and it is ascer
tained that their proper care and in
spection have been neglected.
The late Collis P. Huntington once
Baid to the writer of this article: "Our
company (the Southern Pacific) wouid
gladly pay $500,000 a year for an abso
lute guarantee of the proper working
of all of the safety appliances on our
system. Such a guarantee is an im.
possibility, however, for no living
agency can guard against the frailties
of mankind. Sooner or later the* best
of men will 'fall down' in the line of
duty."
Although the proportion of fatal
railway accidents Is about evenly dis
tributed between Eastern and Western
roads, it is the Eastern roads that pay
the largest proportion of the $75,000,
000 annually in - 'isfaction. of personal
damages. The enormoog traffic that
passes over the Pennsylvania system
and the Vanderbilt lines keeps trains
flying to and from all points of the
compass incessantly. Persons and an
imals are bound to get hurt, and the
wonder is that the number of passen
rers killed is so Jnfiniteslmally small
as compared with the millions that are
carried. In recent years the Pennsyl
vania and the Vanderbllt systems
have paid about one-fourth of the
claims collected under the head of
personal damages. The claim depart
ment of each of . these ayBtemg has
grown steadily, until now each com
pany employs between 500 and 1000
agents, clerks and attorneys In Bifting
claims.
If a farmer's cow gets on the track
and is killed his claim comes up under
the head of personal damages, and he
is not satisfied unless he receives from
the railroad company at leaat double
the market value of the beast. Chaun
cey M. Depew once remarked with
mingled facetiousmess and wisdom:
"New York farmers, I imagine, must
sow pasturage 1 peed between our rail
road tracks, so that thelr^ antiquated
live stock can seek an eternal rest In
the most profitable manner. The New
York Central road has paid about
$1,000,000 for dead cows."
Great Lakes Tilting.
BY G. FREDERICK WRIGHT, A. M.. LL. D.
lAuthor of "The Ice Age In North America,"
"Asiatic Rus>s!a." Etc.] '
(Copyright. 1904, by Joseph B. Bowles.)
Everywhere there are indications that
the land has continued to rise more
rapidly at the north than- at the smith
around the basin of the Great. Lakes.
The lake ridges bordering Lake On
tario, Lake Erie. Lake Huron and Lake
Michigan all show this. These lake
ridges are old shore lines formed when
the ice obstructed the drainage to the
northeast., and so were at the time of
their formation level. But now they
gradually rise, so that they are much
higher at Watertown, N. Y., than they
are at Syracuse, and they are higher
at the northeast end of Lake Erie than
they are at the southwest, and so as
you go north along the shores of Lake
Huron and Lake Michigan, and in the
Red River Valley along the old # shore
lines of glacial Lake Agassiz, it is
faund that- there has been a warping
of the earth's crust since their for
mation, whjch has left them much
much higher to the north than they
are at the south.
G. K. Gilbert of the United States
Geological Survey, after careful study
of the facts, shows that this Qeforma- !
tion of the earth's crust in the basin
of the Great Lakes is still going on,
and is gradually tipping up the basin,
tending to drown out the cities that
are at the southwest end of the lake,
and eventually to turn the whole drain
age over through the line of the Chi
cago drainage canal into the Missis
sippi Valley. The rate of this change
of level at the northeast part of the
basin he finds to be such that the wa
ter level at Chicago will rise from nine
to ten inches in a century. This he
calculates from a stutly of the beach '
marks that were established in Buffalo
and other places a hundred years ago.
He concludes, therefore, that, unless a
dam is erected to prevent it, Lake
Michigan will again begin to overflow
into the Illinois River in about 500
years; for the summit of the channel
leading into the IHinois River is only
about eight feet above the present
mean level of the lake, and only four
or five feet above the high water level.
In 50Q or 600 years, therefore, unless a
dam is built, the water of the Great
Lakes will begin to spill over into the
Mississippi River during its high
stages, and in from 1000 to 1500 years
there will be a continuous flow dur
ing the mean stages of the water, whiles,
in about 2000 years as much will run
into the Illinois River as now runs
over Niagara, and in 3500 years the
rock bottom at the head of Niagara
River will be so high that there will
be no Niagara Falls for tourists to gaze
upon or for electric companies to util
ize for iight and transportation. The
basin of Lake Erie will then drain into
the Mississippi Valley by way of the
Chicago sanitary canal.
Among other places where consid
erable changes in land levels have
taken place in recent times we may
mention the coast of Xew Jersey,
which is. sinking at the rate of about
two feet a century. This is evident
fronythe advance of the water upon
the cbast line and from the burial of
large trees in the New Jersey swamps,
which formerly grew on dry land, but
are now sunk many feet below water
level. Dr. Robert Bell brings evi
dence to prove that the land about
Hudson and James Bay is rising at
the rate of from five to seven feet a
century. The southern coast of Green
land is slowly sinking, while that of
Scandinavia . is rising. Darwin has
shown that the eastern coast of South
America has been rising since the gla
cial period. In 1822 100,000 square
miles along: more than 100 miles of
the western coast was 'permanently
raised three or four feet by a single
earthquake shock. In 1819 the bed
of the Indus at its mouth was sunk
' eighteen feet and the village and port
! of Sindree permanently submerged,
whye a portion of the delta of the
Indus fifty miles long and sixteen
i broad was elevated ten feet. About
1812, following numerous earthquakes
In the vicinity of New Madrid, on the
west side of the Mississippi River, a
little below the junction with the
Ohio, a stretch of country 300 miles
long was so affected by earthquakes
that numerous tracts were sunk down
and others raised, so that many new
lakes and islands were formed and
the bed of the Mississippi ' much
changed. All around the eastern
coasts of the Mediterranean Sea there
j are recent shore lines of partially con
i solidated sand and gravel containing
numerous shells such, as now live in
the Mediterranean. The whole re
gion, from -Cairo to Beirut must re
cently have been raised to the extent
of 200 feet.
In the interior of continents it is
more difficult to find evidence of
changes in land levels, because we
have no fixed data from which to cal
culate. But in two or three places
in New England scientific men affirm
that there have been such relative
changes in the heiehts of mountains
that distant peaks which were once
visible from certain points are now
obscured by the elevation of interven
ing peaks. The engineers of some of
the Pennsylvania railroads have be
come, convinced that the grades are
in some places changing through
gradual variations In earth levels. In
due time. the exact facts will 'be as
certained.

CLOVERDALE CITRUS FAIR.
WE desire that our Eastern readers make a note
that .on the iStii of February, 1904, there was
opened at Cloverdale, in Northern California,
in latitude 39, the twelfth annual citrus fair held in that
town. The oranges and other citrus fruits exhibited
are grown in that vicinity, and are fresh gathered from
the orchards in which they began to ripen last Novem
ber. It should be known that in this State ripe oranges
remain on the trees for months. The mansions on the
fruit plantations of Sutter County, in the same latitude
as Cloverdale, are usually in the midst of groves of
orange and lemon trees, and it is not unusual to see them
in May with the ripe fruit on the trees that has been
yellow since , November. The family * go to the trees
every day for the fruit they use. -
The exhibit at Clovcrdale shows the great abundance
and proves the excellence of the citrus fruits grown
there, and it stands as a witness to the climatic advan
tages of Northern California, a winterless land, where
the oranges and lemons are untouched by frost and can
be shown in the midst of the winter months. Mr. Lea,
in his addres's opening the fair, said: "Cloverdale for
eleven years has stood sponsor for Northern California.
She has by this long series of fairs proclaimed to the
world that her people have cast their lot in a pleasant
place, and that this is the home of ; the lemon, the po
melo, the olive and the orange as well as the grape."
All this, nearly at latitude 40. That is the latitude of
Philadelphia; Columbus, Ohio; Springfield, Illinois; In
dianapolis and Eastern points that are now suffering a
temperature at zero, and below, with storms of sleet
and snow and air of the incidents of a hard and bleak
winter. In Asia it is but little south of Vladivostok and
a little north of Port Arthur, where the salt sea is
frozen. It is north of Sicily, the seat of citrus culture
in Italy, and of Seville, where oranges are grown in
Spain. It is, in fact, farther north than orange produc
tion anywhere in the world outside of California. Here
it Is still south of the citrus zone, for the great orange
orchards of Butte County are in a still higher latitude.
Let our Eastern readers take the map and find Clover
dale, California, and its latitude and then read the ther
mometer at points on the same degree in their own
country, and picture to themselves what is certified by
this exhibit of citrus fruits. While they are tightly
housed against the bleak blasts of winter; with the
streams frozen so that the ice has to be broken daily,
for their animals to drink; with their houses banke.d up
to keep the frost from destroying their winter stock of
potatoes and apples, at Cloverdale the fields and plains
and inclosing mountains are as green as in the Eastern
June, the wild flowers are in bloom, oranges are ripe on
trees that are already in" bloom for the next crop, and
the people are entertaining visitors who come to admire
the great exhibit of citrus fruits and olives, garnished
with the foliage of the palm and bamboo. They will
appreciate how little latitude has to do with the climate
of California. â¢ .
Upon further inquiry they will find that Sonoma
County, where all this exhibit is produced, is also a
banner county in the production of wheat, oats,- rye,
barley, corn, buckwheat, hay, live stock and all that the
Eastern agriculturist is. familiar. with, and in addition to
these grows the fig, pomegranate, grape, Japanese per
simmon, and a wide variety of orchard and field crops.
This is the fact that is so hard to get into the heads
of Eastern people. They are unable to see why we
grow the staples which they produce, in the same soil
and under the same sun that produce the semi-tropical
fruits and the date palm. It would pay the railroads to
advertise excursion rates from the zero land to the
Cloverdale fair, every year, for we can imagine no more
impressive lesson than can be taught by bringing East
ern people through the frost and snow, and introducing
them to such an object lesson without taking them out
of their latitude.
The features of this fair should be preserved in photo
graphs for distribution and exhibit in Eastern cities.
Each should have attached a map of the United States,
with Cloverdale's latitude projected to the Atlantic
Coast. It may seem strange that at >this late day the
climatic facts about California have to be propagated
by such means, but it is true. The facts are so remark
able, so out of line with Eastern experience, that they
are difficult to grasp. When they are fully realized we
are persuaded that Northern California will receive such
a large and desirable accession of population as will
carry the State away up the line at the next census.
It should be known, too, that Cloverdale is merely the
exponent of Northern California. It is not a small and
specially favored spo^, except in the good judgment and
enterprise of its people who make this exhibition. Cli
matically it is representative of conditions that extend
eastward across the State to the Sierras, embracing an
area capable of supporting millions of rural people, under
conditions that make work a pleasure and life a luxury.
The ingenuous editor of a Berkeley college paper,
charming in his youth, wishes to know if it is good form
for a young gentleman to smoke cigarettes in' the pres
ence of young ladies. Where in the world or anywhere
else did this journalistic inquirer conceive his notion of
a young gentleman or a j'oung lady?
AUDIENCE PANICS.
SIR HENRY IRVING, in his fore-curtain speech in
a theater at Chicago, might have omitted his crit
icism of the city .officers arid strengthened his
statement thereby. The awful loss of life in the Iro
quois Thefer was no doubt the. result of panic in. the
audience. The panic was caused by fire. The audience
sat an appreciable time after the fire started, and there
was ample time for it to have escaped if it had moved
promptly and in order.
The valuable part of Sir Henry's discourse is that in
reference to panics. ' Panic in an audience may be caused
by explosion, of a bomb, or by'a personal encounter in
which firearms are used. There have been audience
panics in which all the loss of life was caused by. the
jam at exits. It may seem chimerical to talk about in
suring any audience against panic. When it is prevented*
it has always been by the control of some one with pres
ence of mind to divert attention and exorcise, fear, long
enough to get the. audience to pass out promptly and in
order.'; 'Any theater in the United States can be emptied
in seven minutes of an audience that fills every seat, if
the people act sanely and prouiptl;- That is so brief a
time that no fire can spread from the stage fast enough
to overtake the rear of the retreating column. But, if
under such circumstances, a single person in the mass
begin to crowd and force his way ahead panic starts at
once, . ... ,, '.-..' . â¢
Such awful events as the loss^ in the Iroquois Theater.
may serve a 'useful purpose in the future, far beyond the
Improvement of fireproofing and apparatus in theaters,
if all who seat themselves in any large audience will re
flect upon it and map out a course of conduct in event of
an accident at the moment they take their seats. The
press will do a life-saving service if it will from time to
time familiarize its readers with the subject. Audiences
in churches and theaters and halls cannot be put through
a fire drill. But that drill. in schoolhouses is a most de
sirable training of the young in panic-preventing tactics,
provided they are made to fully understand its purpose.
.When -grown -up the cry of fire should cause them to in
stantly recur to the schoolroom drill of their childhood.
It may be said with perfect truth that no packed audi
ence is absolutely safe from every cause of panic. It has
many causes, and the only safety in an audience is in
everybody preserving presence of mind and in none try
ing to take' advantage of the rest by crowding upon and
trampling others. Of course there is a grave duty upon
public authorities in the matter -of " fireproofing to re
move one cause, and in that of ample exits sufficient for
the quick escape of all, no matter whether the possible
panic be caused by fire or otherwise. If leading actors,
like Sir Henry Irving, would improve their opportunity,
when called before the curtain for a speech, to talk sen
sibly and calmly on the subject, the theater would be
made a sort of training school against panics.
Already evil signs of international complications are
showing on the war-reddened horizon of the Far East.
The Russians are embittered at the evident friendship of
England to Japan, the Britishers are t incensed at the
palpable partiality of Germany to Russia, and France
is watching the Lion with eyes, none too peaceable.
Uncle Sam has the opportunity of his life to serve all,
offend none and profit by conditions he has not made
and should not. seek to disturb.
MUTTERINGS OF A TEMPEST.
IF authentic and persistent reports from the capitals
of Europe seem to give authority to the statement,
by far the most disquieting aspect of the war in the
East is the attitude which Russia has assumed toward
Great Britain in the Tibetan question. From St. Pe
tersburg and Berlin come dispatches averring that tjie
Czar is ready to repulse English aggression in Tibet at
the point of the bayonet if driven to this extreme neces
sity and that he has already obtained ascendency in the
Forbidden Country of such a character as to make fur
ther advance against it on the part of the British nothing
but an act of war. In short,' if the tenor of these semi
official utterances from St. Petersburg be inspired by
actual sentiment in the councils of the Czar it is evident
that Adam Zad is more than willing to come to grapples
with the lion. . .
That being true, it is manifest that Russia's scheme is
nothing else than to precipitate a general Vwar such as
that of the Crimea, wherein all of the powers interested
in the Far Eastern question will be dragged by the in
terests of their respective spheres of sovereignty. To
invite war with England would be to put to the final
arbitrament all of the tangled knot of diplomatic en
deavors woven about the East since China was opened
to <the- powers.. . Russia is well aware that if she threw
down the gauntlet to England, Germany and certainly
France would not bide the coalition between Edward's
empire and that of the Mikado which would follow. Al
most equally certain is she that the realignment of the
powers along a general battle line in Asia would eventu
ally involve the interests of the United States and de
mand that our country take a part in the great quarrel.
At first glance it may per- 1 the height" of foolhardiness
that, Russia, now suffering from the dagger thrusts of
doughty little Japan, should invite another conflict, but
beneath the stolid countenance of the Slav there is al
ways a cunning at work which lets no gleam through the
eyes until the time is ripe for the trap to be sprung.
A general war in which one or more of the powers be
sides herself and Japan were involved would be of in
calculable benefit to the empire of Nicholas. Russia is
weak on the sea, far weaker than even the critics prophe
sied before 'Japan' had the opportunity to do away with
six of her vessels' in two weeks' war, but then Russia is
not a sea power nor one fatally vulnerable to the supe
rior force of a naval armament.
A general war, which would bring her into alliance
with either France or Germany, or possibly both, would
throw into her way armies and more armies to overrun
Asia like the myrmidons at ancient Troy. Russia could
be swept off the sea and yet she would have her thou
sands upon thousands of soldiers, augmented by the
forces of her allies, to swamp the combined forces of
Japan and England. In the final grapple lack of sea
power would count for naught with Russia,, since she
has no colonies and none of her possessions are directly
open to assault from the sea save those along the ice
bound Siberian coast. It would be the preponderance
of armies which would decide the issue.
Though the Czar's Government seems at present to
be suffering heavily ffom the attacks of the Japs and
shows a" remarkable weakness, both in strategy and
fighting ability, conservative students of world politics
see in that nothing, more than a repetition of the state
of affairs -at the qpening of 'the Crimean war. Behind
the 1 Muscovite's - sluggishness and apparent clumsiness
at the war game one must look to catch the first steely
glint of a strife terrible as the wars of Napoleon which
he may be conjuring up in that cold, calculating brain.
Under the spur ..of her own. enterprise, energy and
inherent strength Baltimore is rising from the ashes
of her disaster. Her civic pride will make the business
quarter of the city better- and more beautiful that it was
before the great fire. But even more significant of her
splendid reliance is her choice to repair the injury by
her own effort and her own capital. It speaks well for
the fabulous wealth of our country that one of its cities
can unaided recover under such a fearful handicap.
Ominous are the signs of the resurrection of practical
politics in our public schools. The Board of Education
has discovered, after much crafty solicitation, that pro
bationary teacher-, must be formally elected to the de
partment after they have spent their, years of satisfac
tory^ preliminary service. We may expect soon to hear
of the wholesale removal of probationary teachers and
the appointment of political favorites.
A, milkman was fined a few days ago for mixing water
with milk. In making an example of this offender what
did the authorities mean to impress upon us? Perhaps
they wanted to indicate to us what they can do if they
choose to perform their duty. What a curious incident
it would have been if they had discovered a milkman that
doesn't mix water with milk
TALK OF THE TOWN
AND TOPICS OF THE
TIMES
Measuring Distance.
A group of downtown merchants were
discussing the trouble in the Far East
when one of them asked, "What is the
distance from Mukden to Port Ar
thur?"
"Your question Is a difficult one to
answer," replied Smithkins, "if they
regulate distances there as they do ia
some parts of California."
"What do you mean?" asked the
other.
"A few weeks ago I was called into
the interior on business," said Smith
kins, "and formed the acquaintance cf
a hustling real estate man who was
stopping at the same hotel. 'How far Is
it from here to ?' I asked him
one day, mentioning a small town in
the county, but not on the line of the
railroad. 'Well, that depends,* an
swered the agent, as he threw his
cigar stump at a dog that was sleep
ing near the stove in the office. 'You're
not thinking of buying any land there,
are you?" he cautiously asked. I as
sured him that I had no intention of
investing. 'Well, then, I don't mind
telling you.' he whispered, confidential
ly,' as he lighted a fresh cigar I had
given him. 'It's a good eight miles, but,'
he concluded, 'if you thought of buying
property there it would be only a mile
and a half.* " â¢'â *'? .* *
The Mythical Strad.
Tom Ernst, a clarionet player in the
Musicians' Union, tells the following:
"Of all nuisances, deliver me from
the amateur violin collector. One of
this species used to pester me by al
ways talking 'shop,' although he knew
I belonged to the 'wood wind' and made
no pretense to a knowledge of the
strings. His enthusiasm for his violins
was so great that one day I retaliated.
I began by saying that a few days be
fore while in a carpenter shop I had
found a cracked and worthless violin
in a dirt heap, and thinking to amuse
myself had bought it for 50 cents, taken
it home and begun trying to play. I
thought that would be enough to start
him. It was.
"In a few moments he asked care
lessly, 'Is there any name in that vio
lin?'
" 'Oh, yes,' said I. 'but it Is so old
that the name can't be deciphered. It's
just an old second-hand instrument,
you know. There's a name Inside like
S-t-r or something; I didn't notice It
particularly.*
" 'S-t-r what?' he asked, becoming
perceptibly interested.
" 'Oh, just S-t-r-aâ or some old name
like that; I paid no attention to It, 1 I
anwered.
" 'Yes, yes?' he asked, more excited
ly. 'Is it Strad r â¢ 'i'-'-i'*'
" 'Oh, yes; I think so; I don't know,*
I replied In a tantalizing way.
" 'Well, is it Stradivarius?' he finally
blurted out. *;;.'".'
" 'Yes, I believe that is the name,' I
replied innocently. 'But it's of no Im
portanceâthe violin is not worth any
thing.' V-' ;
" 'No, I suppose not,' he said. Then
in a moment, 'Say, I am willing to give
you $5 for that instrument without see
ing It.' '-. : 'il:
" 'Oh, no,' I said, 'I wouldn't rob
you.'
" 'Well, I'll give you $10 for it,' said
he.
" 'No,' I answered. 'I wouldn't take
advantage of a, friend."
" 'Well, then,' he said, 'I'll give you
$20 for it.'
"As I had no violin and didn't know
where his bidding would stop, I said
simply, 'No, no; I guess not. I've be
come attached to the instrument now
and couldn't bear to part with It." And
I'll bet that fellow is still guessing how
he can secure my Stradivarius."

\ Deadly Cyanide.
The deadly cyanide of potassium,
which whisked the condemned Whit
aker Wright away from the prison
gates, is the most terrible of all cor
rosive poisons. 'According to a Lon
don paper an eminent specialist en
gaged in experiment was once so un
fortunate as nearly to become a victim
to this very method of poisoning^
"I had taken sufficient to give me
some indication of what death in such
a maner would be," he said. "If the
poison be concentrated, so also is the
agony, for it seems as though all* the
sufferings of one's life were endured
In the few seconds during which It is
possible to realize them. The out
standing sensation which I experienced
was the rapidly increasing pressure
upon my brain, as though a rope had
been passed round my head and that
at my forehead was a lever with which
the cords were being- tightened to
bursting ppint.
"Anything so terrible I had no con
ception of and I shudder to think of
it now. Of all methods of death it is
the most cruel. You take the poison.
You drop as though you were shot.
You are not shot. Were you shot, and
well shot, you would be dead. You
are ' neither shot nor dead. You
are left in agony. Seconds become

but you have time to endure, and the
torture that you endure is beyond the
power of words to express."
Fire in London Theaters.
It is not generally known what a re
markable record London theaters have
In the matter of immunity from fira
casualties. Sydney Brooks, in an ar
ticle In the current Harper's "Weekly,
points out that since 1S58 not a single
life has been lost in a London theater
through flre, with the single exception
of the death of a fireman who was
killed on duty during a blaze at tho
Alhambra Music Hall, in 1882. It is.
he comments, "a wonderful, almost an
Incredible record, and it appears hardly
less miraculous If we push our in
quiries back to % the beginning of tha
nineteenth century and survey the last
one hundred and four years. In 1807
twenty-three people were killed in the
panic that followed a false alarm at
the famous Sadler's Wells Theater; In
1S0S a fire broke out during a perform
ance at the Covent Garden Opera
house; the audience escaped, but fifteen
or twenty people who tried to enter the
building to put out the flre were killed;
In 1858 another false alarm, this time
at the Cobourg Theater, led to the
deaths of sixteen people.' So that since
1S00 less than sixty people have per
ished through fires at London theaters,
and for nearly the last fifty years the
record, with the exception noted above.
Is absolutely clean of any sort of fatal
ity."
Making Things Clear.
Americans who go abroad will be glad
to know at last what they have a right
to bring home with them without be
ing'pestered to death by customs offi
cers. Secretary Shaw, who has brought
an unusual amount of common sense
with him Into the Treasury Depart
ment, has issued a circular advising
.trans-Atlantic travelers, when they re
turn from Europe, to put all dutiable
articles near the tops of their trunks
and to bring: original receipted bills
for "articles necessary and decorative
purchased abroad," so as to save cus
toms officers and travelers both a good
deal of trouble. Mr. Shaw announces
also, In accordance with a recent de
cision of the Circuit Court of Appeals,
that each passenger may bring into the
country for himself or any other per
son articles purchased ,abroad to the
amount of $100, provided they are not
for sale. This Includes, however, only

IS FOUND IN CALIFORNIA
Declares That Claims About the Discovery of That Metal
in Mariposa County Are Not True and Denounces Fake.
Dredging About to Begin Near Historic Town of Coloma
State Mineralogist Aubury declares
positively that the claim that radium
has been discovered in Mariposa Cmm
iy. la this Stat?, as claimed by the
â¢.aiifomia Radium Gold Mining Com
â¢ >any, is a fake pur^ and simple. Re
cently the company In Question has
been advertisir.K largely and over one
pordon of the advertisement was a re
quest to the public to investigate.
Aiiueralogi&t Aubury says that he has
investigated carefully, securing many
samples of ore fro-m the Fitch mints,
â¢which is the one operated by the Cali
lornia Gold Radium Mining Company,
and these samples were submitted to
the chemist and assayer of the State
ilining Bureau. Not one of them, so
tays Aubury, contains radium.
"1 do cot beiieve that there is any
radium in California," so Aubury said
yesterday. "What radium there is in
the world that is knenvn has cost at
the rate of 53,000,000 a. ton tc produce
and there is only two pounds of it in
all. This California company adver
tises that whi'.e it takes eight tons of
Uie European ore to produce one pram
cf radium tt is possible to produce the
same amount of radium from a few
ounces of the Mar.posa County ore. I
have had Mr. Preston examine many
specimens of the ore from the Fitch
mine, the one on which glowing adver
tisements are based, and he has re
ported back that there is no radium in
them.
"1 will also refer you to Professor
Arthur S. Kakie of the University of
California, who has written an article
on the subject of the alleged discovery
of radium in Mariposa County. He re
ports that Professor Lewis has tested
the ore and has found it to show less
than one one-hundredth part of the
radio activity of the weakest uranium
compound. 1 will take all possible
means to warn the public that this is
a fake and hope that the admonition
Will be widely read for the credit of
the State. The fact that the ore upon

WATEK FOR TICK MIXERS.
If the rainfall of the. last week in the
mountains could have been utilized by
restraining dams to hold if in check
there would have b^en water enough
to operate mines for a long time. A
graphic account of the precipitation in
the mining region of Nevada County
is given by the Grass Valley Unum, as
follows:

According to the Nevada County
Miner, electricity will be conveyed to
the Deadmans Flat district for the ope
ration of mines. Of the result the
Miner says:
The t>rinÂ«inÂ« of electricity into- the Dead
mans Klat district will be the means of re
viving the mir.inif industry thvre. It will put
new life end eaenry into the comnanies who
are cmeratlnx there and who propose to oper
ate there Jn the future. One of thÂ»> treat
drawback* in thÂ» past haÂ« been th*- lack of
motor power, and th!Â« ha* greatly retarded
ihÂ» development of the vein*. As has been
stated In th^R* columns on different occasions,
there ir a bright future in store for Deadman*
Flat. lierrat developments there ehow that
it possesses rich \>inÂ« and that these will
MBM day develop into famou? mines. Nothing
that could be euirceEted would help the dis
trict moiÂ» than the introduction of electric
power.
Considerable exultation is manifested
over the fact that the Oneida mine in
Amador County has been put in shape

so that a dividend of $40,000 has been
declared. This is the first dividend,
says Ihe Amador Ledger, that the prop
erty has paid since 1S95, at which time
operations In the mine were resumed.
Work has been proceeding steadily for
nine years. The Ledger describes the
work on the mine as follows:
The operation* at the mine continue. The

TO DREDGE XEAR COlXÂ»f A.
According to the Placervllle Nugget,
dredging operations will soon be under
way near Coloma, the site of the
original discovery of gold in El Dorado
County. Over 300 acres of ground in the
vicinity of Lotus and Coloma has been
located and bonded during the last
three vreeks by parties who Intend to
prospect the ground with drills, and if
the prospects prove satisfactory ajarge
dredge will be built to work the ground.
The lands proposed to be worked in
clude the bed of the river from below
Lotus to Coloma, and the large bars at
Coloma and Lotus. A great portion of
the ground the pioneer miners were
prevented from working, owing to their
inability to handle the water.
The great value of radium is inspiring
predictions all over the coast that it
will be discovered in quantities. The
supposed presence of the mineral is
made the basis, to some extent, of a
demand for a State mineralogist for
Nevada, although other reasons are
given for having the services of such
an official. There Is no doubt that the
legitimate mining industry of Cali
fornia has been benefited by having a
mineralogist at the head of a State
Mining Bureau. The Carson Appeal is
urging the creation of the ofllce of
State Mineralogist for Nevada. It
makes an argument which is given in
part for the interest that inheres in the
subject of the mineral development of
the next door mineralized neighbor of
California:
Probably the item that demands this action
more than any other is the discovery of ra
dium, or uranium ore*, in Utah. Utah is a
elster State. She has what we have â the same
orep. the Fame class of mines, and her terri
tory and climate in almost a twin. If ra
dium can be developed In that State then it
can be found in Nevada. Take the following
for instance: How many miners understand
It, and yet rt Is from a scientific paper that
it is intended to enlighten the miner in his
fearch for the wonderful metal of uranium
or any of ita component parts.
Originally radium was obtained from the
uranium mineral pitchblende, and at the pres
ent time uranium mines furnish most of the
material. I'.ut the latest researches, phow that
radium occurs In association with numerous
other minerals and is dispersed In many local
ities throughout the world. These minerals
are distinctly radio-active, and although ra
dium has not been proven to be in all o'
them their radio-active properties are most
probably due to its presence. Uranium, pitch
blende, clevite, alunltc, Blpylite. compounds
of thorium, organlte, m-jnazlte, xenotiire.
aettchynite, fergusonite, samarskite, ntobite,
tantalite, polycrase, euxenlte, columbite, ear
bonlte.
After you read this you don't know where
you are at. Hand it to the average miner and
he c&n't tell one classification from the othtrr,
and yet the metal iÂ» quoted at thousands of
dollars a pennyweight. Had the State a
metallurgriFt who could classify th<> ores there
ip a Iilvi !ih. â â '] that N'evada could produce ra
dium and plenty of it. The thing that Flicks
the miner and prospector is classification. They
depend on the mm;i!e tests, Fuch as acid and
horning, and Fhould they have a piece of
uranhun they would pitch, it over the dump
as useless. It is a f-afe proposition to state
ther* are not half a dozen men in this State
who could tell uranium from sandstone* sim
ply because thfy do not know it and are un
acquainted with the color, weight or general
aspect.
The advantages that are manifested
in this State resulting from the careful
work of the State Mineralogist furnish
an even better argument than is found
in the foregoing extract in advocacy
of the institution of the office of State
Mineralogist in the State of Nevada.
The San Jose Herald says of the con
solidation of the Santa Teresa and San
Juan mines, in Santa Clara County, In
part:
One of the purposes of President Joyce's
v:Â»,it to Fan Jose was to make arrangements
for the consolidation of the Santa Teresa and
the San Juan mines. Both these properties
are owned by practically the same people and
they think they can be put upon a better run
ning ba?is if the two properties are consoli
dated under one company. As soon as Mr.
Joyce reaches Boston the change will take
place. R. 15. Harper of this city will be one
of the directors of the new company and also
manager of the two properties.
WAITING FOR PERMIT.
The Nevada County Miner contains
the following, relative to the Omega
Company's hydraulic mine In Nevada
County:
At the meeting of the executive committee,
of the Anti-Debris Association, held yesterday,
Devlin & Devlin, the attorneys, reported that
they had examined the papers on die by the
Ome~a Mining Company with the California
Debris CommiffFion at Pan Francisco, from
which it appears that t..c - -ea proposed to be
worked by this mining company is two and a
half acres, the height of the bank ninety feet,
the cubic number of yards of material to be
washed 3C3.OOO, which Is estimated to consist
of 20 per cent cobblestones, 50 per cent gravel,
2<> per cent of sand and 5 per cent of loam or
piiÂ»e clay. The mine will drain into Scotch
man Creek, thence into the South Yuba, and
the dource of the water supply is Diamond
Creek. The length of the ditch is five miles,
width five feet and depth three feet, tho
grade of the ditch 'being from five to ten feet
per mile. The nozzles proposed to be used
are from four to six inches, and the pressure
of the water 120 feet. The sluices to be used
are to be four feet wide, three feet dep with
a grade of elx In twelve feet. It is proposed to
raise the present log dam In Scotchman Creek
five feet higher in the same manner and build
lei cribs three feet high at each end above
the dam go raised and filled in the same with
rock. The company claims that it's area lor
impounding basin for holding the debris Is
seventy acres, and the capacity of proposed
Impounding basin Is r>GO.OO(Â» cubic yards. The
works had been completed, but the California
Debri* Commission said they had not yet been
c-x&mined and no permit had been granted. If
p'rmlFsion should be granted for the season. by
the commission It would only be for the pres
ent season.
The attorneys report that the. mine Js under
Injunction as to its past work and its permit
beln- withdrawn by the debris commission,
and Its application was for a new permit,
which had not yet been cranted.

Mrs. Florence Goddard Refuses to
Withdraw Suit for Divorce and

Mrs. Florence Goddard, 260' Third
street, secured a warrant from Police
Judge Fritz yesterday for the arrest
of her husband, Joseph, on a charge
of threats to kill. She said she had
instituted a suit for divorce from him,
as he was in the habit of beating her,
and he called upon her last Tuesday

Oil Promoter in Trouble.
J. I. Reid, who gives his occupation
as an oil promoter, was arrested yes

warrant from Police Judge Fritz's
court charging him with obtaining
money -by false pretenses. The com
plaining witness is J. F. Littlefleld of
W. P. Fuller & Co., Pine and Front
streets. It is alleged that Reid on No

the money and signed a receipt for it
rHE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, â  SATURDAY. FEBRUARY ..20, 1904.
FUND IS SHORT
FOR CITY SHOW
Out of $50,000 Needed to^Iake
Municipal Exhibit, Less Than
One Half Has Been Subscribed
RECEIVE BUILDING BIDS
Committee Arranges to Have
No. Duplications in' Articles
to Be Placed! in Exposition
The finance committee that Is secur
ing funds and- subscriptions to have a
San Francisco building and San Fran
cisco exhibit in that building at the St.
Louis Exposition is still short about
528,000 of the $50,000 that it is estimated
will be necessary to install and main
tain the show throughout the exposi
tion season.
The Supervisors provided $15,000,
which it is estimated will pay for the
building to be erected and will also
provide a balance of $3000 or so to be
devoted to other uses connected with
the San Francisco part of the great
show. The finance committee has
raised by subscriptions something like
$7000 to date. That leaves $28,000 still
to be subscribed and paid in.
There is some expectation that the
roof garden cafe which will probably
be permitted by the exposition man
agement to grace the top of the San
Francisco building will yield something
of fair size toward the payment of the
running expenses at St. Louis, but this
is uncertain because it has not been
decided that all objections on thÂ« score
of fire danger from the roof cafe can
be set aside. Therefore the lack of
funds to make San Francisco secure is
$28,000 approximately.
Letters and dispatches have been re
ceived from Samuel Xewsom.'the archi
tect who prepared the plans for the
San Francisco structure at St. Louis,
and also from T. C. Judkins, who went
on to St. Louis to let the contracts for
the construction of the building. The
Instructions to the San Francisco repre
sentatives in St. Louis included a pro
vision that If bids for putting up the
municipal building should exceed $12,000
then nothing additional should be done
after the bids were opened without con
sultation with the finance committee of
the San Francisco general committee.
A dispatch was received yesterday
from Mr. Judkins in which he an
nounced that the bids had been opened
and that he believed that It would be
possible to have the building construct
ed at a reasonable figure. This is sup
posed by the committee to indicate that
the bids have fallen within the $12,000
limit. A letter from Architect Newsom
also conveyed the fact that all- the large
buildings on the exposition gYounds
have been completed to the extent of
80 per cent, and that many of the small
er ones are finished and are already re
ceiving exhibits. Newsom also wrote
that this advanced condition of the
construction work would probably
make it possible to have competition
among the larger contractors for build
ing the San Francisco structure. No
additional particulars have been re
ceived concerning the bids.
The San Francisco sub-committees
are reported to be working actively.
Each booth In the San Francisco build
ing will be distinct and separate in
character of its exhibits, and it is an
nounced that there will be no duplica
tions. Jt is believed that the greater
the variety of San Francisco exhibits
the keener will be the interest of spec
tators. Educators have been In confer
ence with the San Francisco committee
during the week. It has been practical
ly determined which grammar, primary
and high school shall be represented at
St. Louis as characteristic of San Fran
cisco's educational system. The names
of these schools have not been made
public. The Lick School â Vill represent
technical training. An engineering
school in this city will also be selected
to make an engineering exhibit.

Danish Professor Is Coming
Here to Measure the Velocity
of 'the Earth's Rotary Motion
A meeting of the Park Commission
was held yesterday afternoon at the
office of trie president, A. B. Spreckels.
Commissioners W. J. Dingee.'R. H.
Lloyd, Frank J. Sullivan, A. Altman,
Superintendent McLaren and Secre
tary de Succa attended the session. An
ordinance, as follows, relating to auto
mobiles in Golden Gate Park, was
passed to print and will go into effect
ten days hence:
Ordinance for the regulation, use and gov
ernment of the parks, squares, avenues and
grounds In the city and county of San Fran
cisco, which are under the exclusive contrul
and management of the Park Commissioners
of the city and county of Ban Francisco:
The Park Commissioners of the city and
county of San Francisco do ordain as follows:
Hectlon 1 â No horseless carriage, motor
wc.on, motprcycle or automobile shall enter
or no upon any avenue, driveway or part of
any park or square in the city and county of
San Francisco except that driveway in Golden
Gate Park commencing at the entrance known
as "Waller-street entrance" to said park and
termlnatinj: at the exit on tho great highway
(which latter Is <sometimea called the "Ocean
Boulevard"), which driveway Is known as the
south drive in Golden Gate Park; and also on
and upon the said great highway commencing
where the northerly line ot Fulton street,- If
projected westerly, would intersect said great
highway; thence southerly from eald line to
the southerly end of said great highway.
Only such vehicles as are exclusively U9ed for
pleasure shall be permitted upon the said
driven and highways.
Sec. 2 â Upon the straight portions of sarJ
driveways, the speed of said vehicles shall not
exceed ten miles per hour, and around the
curves thereof the speed shall not exceed eight
mils per hour, and upon the great highway
from the southerly line of Golden Gate Park
where the northerly line ot H street. If pro
jected westerly, would cross said great high
way, to the point where If the northerly line
of Fulton street was projected westerly it
would cios8 said Kreat highway, the speed
rhall not exceed six miles per hour; and upon
such portions of said great highway all gaso
line prooelled vehicles must use mufflers and
every precaution shall be taken by the person
or persons in charge or control of any of the
vehicles hereinbefore mentioned to prevent said
vehicles from maklns any unnecessary noise
or frightening any teams, horse or hqrses upon
said great highway or Interfering with the
<:uict and safe enjoyment of said great high
way by any person or persons.
Sec. 3 â All automobiles operating under this
ordinance shall have their permit number in
the center of the front and back of the ma
chine, the flffures of such numbers not to be
less than flve inches in size.
Sec. 4 â Any person violating any of the pro
visionsNof this, ordinance shall be deemed
euilty of misdemeanor and shall be punished
by Imprisonment In the County Jail of the
city and county of San Francisco not exceeding
bIx months, or by a fine not exceeding $500
nor less than ?r>0, or both.
THE OVERLOOK DRIVE.
The original ordinance introduced
by Mr. Lloyd included the Overlook
drive among the avenues open to au
tomobiles. The order, amended on
motion of Mr. Spreckels, excludes the
Overlook drive. The order as passed
gives the automobilists an avenue
from the great highway, or Ocean
boulevard, to the Cliff House. The
route winds to the rear of Sutro
Heights.
Commissioners Lloyd, Altman, Din
gee and Spreckels voted in favor of the
ordinance. Commissioner Sullivan was
excused from voting. Mr. Dingee, in
his explanation of! his vote, remarked
that he did not own a machine, but
he recognized the fact that the auto
mobile was an institution that had
come to stny.
In the discussion of the topic the ne
cessity for additional police protection
in Golden Gate Park was dwelt upon.
President Spreckels remarked that he
had talked with Mayor Schmitz on the
subject and the Mayor had promised
to do what he could to assist the com
mission.
The commission decided to pur
chase two dozen fox-tailed squirrels
and two arch-necked trumpet swans
for Golden Gate Park. Mr. Spreckels
expected to get the squirrels from
Mount Lowe. A* letter from H. E.
Huntington was read, in which the in
formation was conveyed that the
Mount Lowe squirrels were not attain
able. Mr. McLaren knows where the
fox- tailed squirrels can be had for $2
each. Â«;
SPEED OF THE WORLD.
Commissioner Lloyd presented a
letter from the International Geodetic
Association, Copenhagen, in which the
Park Commissioners are advised that
Professor Hecker will arrive here in
July, 1904. Incidentally the Copen
hagen association desires to know if
there is. a hotel near the Davidson
Observatory wherein the professors
may dwell for two weeks. The main
purpose of Professor Hecker's expe
dition to California is to swing a pen
dulum on the exact spot where it was
once before swung when calculations
were made to determine the exact ve
locity of the earth's rotary motion.
The pillars of the old Davidson Ob
servatory in Lafayette square, between
which the pendulum was formerly
suspended, still stand, and as the Park
Commission exercises sovereignty
over this zone, the right to swing^ pen
dulums thereon rests with the board.
The commission readily granted the
privilege desired by the Copenhagen
experts. Mr. Lloyd, who seems to
have mastered the subject and is real
ly eager to ascertain if any errors
were made in previous measurements
of the world's revolving speed, ex
plained that the calculation could not
be made as accurately at the State
universil> as at Lafayette square be
cause latitude and longitude .at the
latter place had been exactly deter
mined.
The Commissioners resolved to have
music in Golden Gate Park on Mon
day, February 22, Washington's birth
day. On this point the board was
unanimous and Commissioner . Sulli
van enthusiastic.
On motion of Commissioner Alt
man the board decided to advertise for
proposals for the erection of a drink
ing fountain at the Conservatory,
Golden Gate Park. Some months ago
the board accepted Earl Cummlngs'
design for a fountain and the question
arose as to 1 whether this acceptance
could exclude bidding on other de
signs. Mr. Sullivan maintained that
the commission should invite compe
tition on designs and give all the
sculptors a chance to win fame.
The reiterated statement of Mr, Alt
man that the board had already ac
cepted the Earl Cummlngs design set
tled the question and the motion to
invite bids prevailed. Mr. Sullivan
was excused from voting.
Mr. Lloyd remarked that there was
a tendency to crowd on the park la
boring force men who were incapable
on account of advanced age to per
form the work required. He suggest
ed that a rule be adopted to give em
ployment only to men under 40. The
proposition was not favorably ; re
ceived, although Mr. Lloyd insisted
that the park- should not be made an
asylum for old and worn out work
men. Opponents of the suggestion
contended that some men at 60 were
better than others at 30.. No vote
was taken, but Mr. McLaren, . the su
perintendent,* was advised to give em
ployment ; only ; to those capable of
performing a good day's work.
CLAIMS IRW1N
IS A PERJURER
Father of Sadie Lyons Says
Son-in-Law Swore to an" Un
truth When He Got License
WANTS BONDS ANNULLED
Avers That Hfs Daughter
Is Now Only a Few Months
Over Fifteen Years of Age
Ralph Bert Irwin, the young man
who, on the night of February 6,
swore that pretty Sadie Lyons was 18
years of age, secured a marriage 11*
cense and then after Justice of the
Peace Thomas- Dunn had refused to
make Miss Lyons his wife, went to the
chambers of Justice of the Peace
Lawson and prevailed upon him to
perform the ceremony, perjured him
self if the allegations of Alexander
Lyons, the young girl's father, made
in a suit to annul the marriage, are
true. Lyons avers that his daughter
is only 15 years and 10 months old;
that Irwin perjured himself when he
swore to Deputy County Clerk Dan
forth that she was IS years of age
and did not need the consent of her
parents to enable her to marry him.
WOULD SEVER TIES.
The suit was filed yesterday. It
asks for the annulment of the mar
riage on the ground that Miss Lyons,
being under age, had not secured the
consent of her parents to become the
wife of Irwin.
When asked about the matter yes
terday Judge Lawson said:
â¢'I remember the young woman
very well, because I remarked her
youthful appearance, and in order to
find out how old she was asked her
in what year she was born. She told
me she was born in May, 1885. I
then asked her where her parents re
sided and she told me the only rela
tive she had was an uncle, who lived
in Oakland. Under such conditions I
could do nothing but make them
band arid wife, particularly after
young Irwin had most emphatically
informed me that the young woman
was over 18."
FLOODS ARE UNHAPPY.
A suit for divorce was filed yester
day by Anna M. Flood against Thomas
F. Flood for cruelty. She says that
ever since their marriage in 1901 he
has displayed a quarrelsome, morose
and malevolent disposition and has
made her life a burden. She says that
he also wanted to bring his mother
to their home and thus place her in
an intolerable condition of subjection.
Divorces were also asked for by Ma
bel Foster from John A. Foster for
neglect, W. A. Lazzarevich from Mary
S. Lazzarevich for infidelity and Clar
ice Vitant from Achille Vitant for in
temperance.
Decrees of divorce were granted to
Mary A. Baker from Jacob H. Baker
for neglect and Gustave Lindee from
Nita Stone Lindee for desertion.
On request of the attorneys for
Edith May Partello Madden, the de
fendant in the suit for divorce brought
by Captain John Madden, U. S. A.,
Judge Hebbard has continued the
matter for thirty days from to-day.
Mrs. Madden claims that she needs
the extra, time in which to prepare
and file her answer to her husband's
complaint t
School Board's Demurrer Argued.
Judge Hunt heard argument yester
day on a demurrer to the petition of
James B. SlcSheehy for a writ of man
date compelling the Board of Educa
tion to approve .his warrant for his
salary as inspector of schoolhouses.
He will decide the case within a few
days. The suit is the result of a quar
rel over patronage between the School
Board and the Board of Public Works.
The last named board appointed Mc-
Sheehy and the School Board refused
to countenance its action on the
ground that the Board , of Public
Works had no power to appoint any
one for service in the School Depart
ment.
Ex-Chief Justice Wins Case.
Justice of the Peace Dunn yester
day gave judgment for $168 in favor
of John Currey, who sued William
O'Dea for the amount on a promissory

CARDINAL BALL PLAYERS AND TRACKMEN IN TRAINING
FAST GREYHOUNDS
READY FOR SLIPS
Champions of the Sward Will
Compete at Union Coursing
Park in Two Notable Events
The sreaic5t events of the year in
coursing circles will be the two big
meets at Union Coursing Park on to
morrow and Monday. Devotees of the
game will journey to this city from all
pans of the State, and high-class
hounds from norths south, east and
west will comr>cte for honors in the
two big stakesâ the Boll Brandon chal
lenge cup stake and the California
Plate sUke.
The entry list for the two stakes are
just double that of last year and hence
there will be at least double the inter
est. The occasion will be the eighth
annual revival at Union Park. When
the first stake vas run here eight dogs
were entered for the Belle Brandon
cup. This number has steadily in
creased, till now thirty-six young
hounds are entered for honors.
Not one of these puppies has ever
been slipped before, so it can easily be
imagined how they will be watched
when thjy get into the running for
the first rune. Every one of the young
sters is highly bred and carefully
trained and no doubt the meeting will
bring out some likely candidates for
championship honors.
The California Plate event will 1>Â«
a BQtewortby affair. All the hounds
that will be slipped arc stake win
ners man;- times over. After the first
round of this stake has.boen decided
there is sure to bo a battle royal be
tween the remaining dogs and* every
one of them stands a splendid chance
of getting away v.-ith the honors and"
the valuable cup Rrhicfa former Mayor
James D. Phelan offers to the Winner.
The hounds from Sacramento will be
headliners in the event. In fact, they
arc already doped to be in the running
rear the last. Arrons the Capital city
performers are Sacramento Boy, twice
winner of the John Grace challenge
cup; Pocatelli. the present American
champion; Tillie 11, Barge, Quita and
Silver Heels.
There are also some very fast ones
from the local fields. Among these are
Full Moon, Liberator, Mount RoÂ«e
Palo Alto, Real Article, Haphazard
Richard Anton. Cloverdale. Tralee Boy,
Vandal and Liberator. Such an arFay
of talent from San Francisco is prom
ising and the wise ones look to these
dogs to do some startling work.
From Los Angeles come Lost Chord,
Charta Member. Galveston and Tom
King. Each of these is a fast one and
due to run In good form. Lost Chord
was the runner up of the John Grace
challenge cup of 1902 and the other
three have all made good records on
the local sward as well as at home
The only notable entry from Stockton
is Dr. Clark's L. L. C. Just what he
will do remains to be seen, but he is
touted as a wonder.
There are sixteen fast Eastern dogs
entered In the Ftake. The most notable
of these is Lord Brazen, acknowledged
to be the fastest of the whole lot.
Then there are Advertiser, Bill Dugan
and Bardoot Boy. all from the same
kennel, and all well known to the devo
tees of the game in this city.
Joe Pasha and Crawford Belle should
make a cood showing, as should Celtic
J. E. H. and Rolla Wells. Charming
Thought, Cloudburst and Comstock are
looked upon as likely ones from the
Middle West. Texas Betty and Texas
Hoo Hoo have been doped to remain
with the last four dogs fn the stake
if they are In condition for the run
The initial round of the Belle Bran
don cup will bÂ« run down first. Then
the California Plate is to be decided,
and on Monday a consolation stake of
thirty-two doss will be run off, after
â w-hjeh the Belle Brandon cup stake will
be i completed. Trains will leave on
Eunday at 10:15 and 11, a. m., 12 m. and
BOWLERS GETTING
READY FOR PLAY
Great Sport Is Expected When
the Big Tournament on the
Green Commences in April
The quarterly meeting of the San
Francisco Scottish Bowling Club, held
Thursday night, was not as well at
tended as was rtcpected, considering the
importance of the business transacted.
Much was accomplished at the meet
ing and work was planned for the next
six months to come.
Arrangements for both the* singles
and doubles tournaments were com
pleted and the time limits of the differ
ent rounds of each fixed. The draw
ing for the singles was held at the pre
vious meeting. In the preliminary
round there will be twenty-eight
matches. They must be completed by
May 14. The green will be opened on
April 1. The other rounds will close on
the following dates:
First round (thirty-two matches).
June "5.
Second round (sixteen matches), July
Third round (eight matches), Aug
ust 12.
Fourth round (four, matches), Aug
ust 27.
Fifth round (two matches), Septem
ber 10.
Finals, September 17,
Thirty-six of the best players in the
club entered the first doubles tourna
ment. Partners â  were drawn by lot.
and in many rases the best players
drew together. Xos. 1 and 2 out of the
hat play together against Xos. 3 and 4,
and so on.
On paper the best team, and there
fore the one most likely to win, is J. C.
Moffatt and Andrew Foreman. Moffatt
is the present champion and Foreman
is rated one- of the best players.- Such
teams as Jchn Duncan and M. L.
Crowe, J. Stott and J. McLaren. J.
Webster and (1. C. Patterson. and. Y. C.
Lav. son and W. C Craig are considered
by many to be fully as strong as Mof
latt and Foreman.
This event, like the singles, will be
commenced on April 1. There will be
two matches in the preliminary round
and eight in the first. Owing to the
size of these events they will probably
lie the only ones played during the
summer. Others v,iil be arranged for
the fall. . â  â 
J. C. Moffatt, the winner of the last
singles tournament, was presented. with
an elegant pair of silver-mounted
bowls. They are made of .. the finest
kind of wood and have the regulation
No. 2 bias. The question of bias and
stamping the balls that come up to the
requirement was discussed at length
Thursday night. " " :
All the bowls must be of No. 3 bias,
the only one recognized by ! the big
clubs in Scotland. When, a bowl has
been tested and is passed a small, T,
standing for tested, surrounded by an
arrow or some other emblem- to be de
termined upon by. the -bowls committee,
will be stamped on It.

THE; SAN: FRANCISCO : CALL,., SATURDAY. FEBRUARY 20, 1901.
PLAYERS OF GOLF
IN BOGIE EVENT
Handicaps for Men and Women
Will Take Place on 3Ionday
at the San Rafael Links
During the coming three days many
golfers will be in evidence on the Pre
sidio links. This afternoon there will
be a handicap over eighteen holes
against bogie for the men of the San
Francisco Golf Club, first and second
prizes being offered.
On Washington's birthday there will
be a qualifying round over eighteen
holes, medal play, with handicap, the
sixteen players who return the lowest
scores being entitled to enter the
match play. Each round of tlae match
play must be competed within four
days- and the < two contestants who
reach the final round will receive
prizes.
The gayeties of the winter season
being now over, the ladies bf the Sail
Francisco Golf Club .will have more
time to devote to the link.s. Since. the
beginning of the year the competitions
set down on the schedule have fallen
through for lack of entries, but on
Tuesday morning,- beginning at 9:30,
the members of the Ladies' Annex will
hold a handicap over eighteen holes.
On Washington's birthday there will,
be competitions for men and women
on the links of the San Rafael Golf
Club. Beginning at 0 iu the morning
there will be a" competition over
eighteen holes, with handicap, for the
men, and, beginning at 10, the ladies
will hold a handicap over nine holes
and a putting contest.
II seems likely that the homc-and
home matches that have been held for
some .seasons past between teamV of
men representing the Sun Francisco
and Oakland Golf clubs> will not take
place this season. The first of these
thirty-six-hole matches, eighteen on
one of the courses and eighteen on the
other, usually has taken place in De
cember or not later than : : January,
while the second match has been
played early in April. v
If the team of th-s same club won
both matches the interclub trophy be
came the properly of the winhing'club,
but if each team won one match a de
ciding match, tjoiieluded in one -day,,
was played on neutral .--links.' On the
two occasions- on /which a deciding
match has. been necessary it: has been
played on the Burlingame . Country
Club course. \ v
.At present the 'Oakland golfers are
hardly in a position to enter into a
match, as their course at Adams Point
has been seriously curtailed and their
new country- club "course is not yet
ready for use. It might, however, be
possible to arrange for a match or a
number of matches, each taking up
one day, on a neutral couse and it is
to be hoped that this may be done. "
Many of the golf courses around
London, England, have suffered great
ly ! from the-,. long continued wet
weather, alternating with". frosts. The
fair greens are scarred in all directions
and the putting greens havebeen worn
almost " bare .-Â«f grass. Mild weather
coming after .a" speir of frost is very
destructive, to a golf course, 1 for then
the- surface is softened, "while -the
ground beneath remains hard. -
It has been.suggested that "It would
be well worth .while under
slances like these to abstain from'play
for two or three days, but itis doubt
ful whether .the members ..would con
sent to do it. .:; - -.-â¢;.â  ;
" _; No; game, except billiards, tests the
nerve so severely sifi golf. .. Some:play
ers become irritated at an inattentive
caddie or are put off .their game by the
lucky chances : that "happen to "their,
opponent; An English golf 'writer sug
gests that it is a good â  plan firmly; to
repress all outward "marks of annoy
ance and so. to : ' strengthen -the nerve
by the â , exercise ; of self-control. 'The
player who loses.one hole should set
himself deliberately to win the"next.''
RACKET WELDERS
TO BE KEPT BUSY
Three Big Tournaments.: Will
Engage the Attention of the
Tennis Players About Bay
The next three days "will be lively
ones for the racket wielders of the
bay counties. Tournaments- will be
held in San .Francisco, Oakland and
San Mateo. The event in which the
most interest centers is the one for the
championship of Alameda County. At
San Mateo there will be an invitational
mixed doubles on Monday, given by
Miss Jewell on the Hotel Mateo courts.
There is a handicap, doubles scheduled
to be played on the California Ciub
courts on Washington's birthday. The
fourth class players will complete their
tournament to-morrow at the park.
The Alameda County championship
tournaments are enhanced in both im
portance and interest by the fact that
for the first time they are "open."
Heretofore only residents of the coun
ty have been allowed to compete. All
the cracks from this side of the bay
have entered both singles and doubles
and some great tennis will result.
Such men as Druminond MacGavin,
WiJl Alien, the Bakers and Murdock
brothers and R. Variel will furnish
high-class matches. <
All the clubs across the bay- have
joined forces and the tournaments this
year will be more successful than any
of the kind held'in the past.
. The great revival across the bay is
very pleasing to the players on this
side., Alameda County ten years ago
turned out many champion players,
amorifc â¢ . them being the Xeal and
Hardy brothers and Charles Hubbard.
During the last few years the game
has not prospered across the bay.
There are now about six clubs in Ala
meda. County, and .the game is more
popular Uiaii ever. It wag certainly
a wise. move when the tournaments
were thrown open to. all comers. The
presence of the cracks from thfa side
of. the bay will help the sport greatly.
As soon as the clubs across the bay
join the Pacific States Lawn Tennis
Association arrangements will be made
for annual tournaments for the cham
pionship of the bay counties. There
are probably fifty clubs in the State,
but the only ones'. in 'the. association
and therefore the only ones with the
right to hold championship . tourna
ments are the California and Golden
gate clubs of San Francisco.. I
Despite the fact that Southern Cali
fornia has carried off the coast cham
pionship for* the last two years, none
of the clubs down south belong. to the
association. There are many more
players in the State -to-day than ever
before and all that is lacking is a lit
tle organization. '
The San Mateo tournament is. a pri
vate and more or. less: of a social af
fair. Ray Splivalo and Werner. Stauf,
t\\o prominent members of the Cali
fornia Tennis Club, .will": compete. Miss
Ellen Page of j the same, club is the
cnampion of San Mateo County. With
her in the tournament are entered Miss
Beatrice Splivelo. Miss ; Cornell; Miss
Jewell, Miss.Boyd and Miss C. 1 'Moves.
,W. ; Moore and A. Selby will - be ' among
the entries. . ' ? \
The handicapi singles : tournament
commenced by the women of! the Gold
en Gate Club : Annex will.be, completed
this .afternoon at the .park. / In the
finals Mies Mabel Hotchkissv will meet
the winner of .the match between -Miss
Ethel Ratcliffe and Miss Lulu-Wegener.
Miss Ratcliffe .has wpn the â  cup awice
and the other. two players will da their
utmost to keep her from gaining a" third
and last victory. '.
Miss Hotchkiss has won the trophy
once. "She and Miss Ratcliffe are 15 3-6
behind scratch. Miss Wegener' is 15
above- scratch, and with these' odds will
be hard for theothertwo to beat:
Several matches were 'played by the
fourth.class men at the park last Sun
day. This class will - be - finished to-
THREE MEMBERS OF STANFORD
BASEBALL TEAM OF WHOM CAR
DINALS ADMIRERS EXPECT MUCH.
VARSITY TOSSERS
NOT YET IN FORM
Stanford Men Seem Unable to
Acquire Snap and Ginger
â¢in Their Preliminary Practice
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Feb. 19.
â Although the cardinal nine has been
on the diamond for a month, its work
the past -week has not been encourag
ing:. Many of the players get in the
game in a listless, careless fashion* that
does not augur well for a perfected
team. The fielding has been ragged,
but not perhaps so bad as the base
running.
In spite of Coach Doyle's admonition
to "watch the ball," the men while
on bases frequently become careless
and overlook chances to advance. This
was particularly noticeable in the
twelve inning tie game played with
Santa Clara Thursday. If the varsity
players had run bases as well as the
Santa Clarans did the game would not
have been a tie.
Sales, '06, has been doing most of the
pitching up to this time owing to the
fact that Tritch, who occupied the box
in the second game against Berkeley
last year, has been troubled with a
sore arm. Sales proved very effective
in the last game with Santa Clara and
has ke*pt up a remarkable batting rec
ord. Until Thursday he' had batted
"1000" in the scheduled games, and in
the game that day his record was three
hits out of four times up.
The varsity lines up at present as
follows: Ball, catcher: Sales, Tritch
and Roosevelt, pitchers; Blake, Mat
thews and Moore, first base; Williams,
second base; Trowbridge, shortstop;
Swain, third base; Stott.' right field;
Wirt. center field; Chalmers, left fiefrd.
Whether or not this will be the per
manent organization is purely a matter
of conjecture. Coach Doyle is trying
out all the candidates thoroughly in
an endeavor to get the best possible
combinatiqn.
Trainer Moulton is well satisfied with
the outlook on the track, but to the
average observer conditions are nc/t so
favorable for a Stanford victory as a
cardinal enthusiast could wish. Stan
ford's losses have been very great,
while her gains from this year's fresh
men class have not been commensurate
with Berkeley's.
Of Stanford's sure point winners there
remain in college the following: Hyde,
in the shot-juu; Dunn and Crc-33man.
in the quarter mile; Captain Holman,
in the mile: Dole -and Beach, in the
pole vault, and Bell In the high jump.
However, "Dad" Moulton thinks he
has the material from which to de
velop a victorious team, and the Stan
ford rooters are confident that if it is
possible to bring forth such a team
"Dad" will develop it.
COLLEGE 31EX WILL MEI'Tl'
SOLDIKKS OX BALft. FIELD
Fast Game Is Expected When' Rival
Nines Clash Â«on Presidio Dia
mond Tliis Afternoon.
Joe Wagner's all-star soldier ball
team will line up against a picked nine
from the alumni of the University of
California and Stanford at the Presidio
athletic grounds this afternoon at
2:30. If nothing happens the game
should certainly prove to be the best
amateur struggle that has taken place
in this city for a long tim*. for each
team is made up of players who have
starred on many nines throughout ths
State.
The soldier boys will pin their faith
to Forsyth nnd Conrad, the crack bat
tery of the Presidio team. Those men
have been doing great work for the
men in blue since the team was or
ganized and have made a wonderful
record. Overall, the noted athlete
from Berkeley, will probably pitch for
the college men, or if he is unable to
appear, Parker, formerly of Stanford,
will do the slab work. Reed, the for
mer Harvard fullback and catcher,
will play behind the bat.
Following is the line-up:

morrow. The other three classes will
be played the following Sunday.
. It is more than likely that the Cali
fornia Club tournament set for Mon
day will be- postponed. Several of the
prominent club players have entered
the tournaments across the bay. If
the two conflict the local event will
projjably go ever.
CarrNeal, formerly one of the best
players In the United States, has played
nt the California Club courts several
times during the week. Mr. Neal made
a. better showing in the East than any
other Calif ornian." He won, the West
ern championship about ten years ago.
The number of entries for the Ala
meda County championship singles was
much larger than was expected. Forty
eight of the best players from both
sides of the bay will meet to-day, to
morrow and Monday.
The drawing is as follows:
Preliminary roundâ F. Webster vs. R. Gor

DOLPHINS READY
FOR ACTIVE WORK
North Beach Rowing- Clnb Will
Pick Crews of Four - Oared
Barges for March Regatta
Oarsmen and members of the Dolphin
Swimming and Boating Club are look
ing forward to an active season.
Though the membership roll was ex
tended by the creation of twenty va
cancies, only five or six of these now
remain, and there will soon be a wait
ing list of candidates for membership.
The boats are being put into shape,
the barge Arion having been painted
white with blue ornamentation, so that
she is now one of the prettiest craft
en the bay.
It is expected that many members
will visit the clubhouse on Sundays
and holidays. A club regatta, for
which any member may enter, will be
held on March 20. For the barge races
four ef the most skillful oarsmen of
the club will be selected and will pick
crews. There will be two preliminary
races and a final, the members of the
winning crew receiving medals pre
sented by the club. The crews will be
made as even in strength as possible,
so as to increase the interest in the
event.
The club will purchase two additional
outrigged skiffs and sculling races will
be held among the members. At the
next regular meeting of members the
question of buying: a new four-oared
racing barge will be decided.
The South End Rowing Club, which
has been in a quiescent condition for
some time, is beginning to show signs
of life and expects to have its new
house on the site next to the Ariel
boathouse ready for use In a short
time. When the boats and other club
property are housed in the new quar
ters crews will be formed and regular
practice will begin.
Grand Jury InvesUsates.
The Grand Jury examined several
witnesses regarding a complaint filed
by Mrs. Carrie Frey that she had been
swindled in a half interest transaction
by J. D. Bales. Mrs. Frey had previ
ously sued Bales for the return of
part of the money paid for a business
agency, but Judgment was given
against her by Justice of the Peace
Lawson. who found that the transac
tion was perfectly honest. The Grand
Jury took no action regarding the
bringing of an indictment, as it de
sires to hear from the complaining
witness, who is out of town.
Proceedinss Are Stayed.
The Supreme Court haa issued an
order restraining the Recorder's Court
of Pomona from proceeding further in
the case of P. J. Denninger. The de
fendant i3 charged with violating a
city ordinance in enlarging more than
the fixed legal rate for ga,s. The Su
preme Court will render an opinion in
the matter which will settle the ques
tion as to the extent of authority of
Board of Supervisors in fixing rates to
be charged by companies supplying

â¢narrowest of margins at Inglesiiie yes

and coupled with her stable companion
Arabo, had first call in the betting:.
Princess Titania opened equal favorite

to 16 to 5. Ananias had only 93 pounds

Jack Martin got up with Dainty. gain-

San Nicholas was prominent to the

The track was still slow, accounting
for the ordinary time made in the dif
ferent events. 4 Five more favorites

ner being the only successful public
choicfe.
Willie See made a late ride- with!
Hrennus, favorite for the first event,
losing to Charley McCafferty's Flaneur
in a head finish. Flaneur was second
choice in the ring and led from the
" rtart. See apparently figured on hav

If Golden Idol is going to continue
running out the entry of Dr. Rowells
youngster should be refused until cured
of the habit. It is not right to have
the public's money burned up as it was
yesterday. There were c-nly five start
ers, and Golden Idol opened a 7 to 10
chance, with 9 to 10 later on obtainable.
As usual, he ran out on the stretch
turn and Daly took matters so calmly
that Bullman on Bcse Eley picked up
the lead there. Although pounds the

Edgecliff more than a length.
Young Morello w..s installed a mild

in Modder. a 4^= to 1 chance, piloted by
Stuart, which passed the pace maker.
Rustic Girl, in the run home, scoring

shot, ran into the show.
â¢ Travers did much better with Har
bor in the second six-furlong selling
affair. He avoided the early pace on
the back stretch, and then getting
through on the rail on the bend for
thp wire took the lead from Riesca.
At the finish Travers was kept very
busy, for See came with a rush on the ;
outside with the favorite Hulford, only
losing the decision by a head. The
shc-w went to Riesca.

ROYAL EULOGY
COMES IN TIME
Diplomacy of England's Sov
ereign Saves the Ministry
From an Awkward Position
LONDON, Feb. 19.â The royal eulogy
of Lord Roberts contained in a special
army order issued yesterday evening,
in which King Edward took leave of
Lord Roberts as commander in chief of
the army, is commented upon as an
other instance where the tact of the
King rescued the Ministers from an
awkward dilemma. The curt manner in
which the War Minister dismissed the
commander deeply incensed him, and
this feeling was shared by the public to
such an extent that it threatened to
lead to a serious attack on the Govern
ment in Parliament. The King's first
Indication of his disapproval of the
War Office's treatment was to invite
Lord Roberts to Buckingham Palace,
where marked attention was shown to
the field marshal. This has been fol
lowed by the general army order, which
was sent out by the King personally.

ANCIENT BOXER
GOES TO CARPET
IN THIRD ROUND
George McCarthy Fails to Per
form as of -Yore and Young;
Opponent Has an Easy Time
A heavy-weight fist artist, who might
have shone in bygone days, was trotted
out before the admiring throng at the
San Francisco Athletic Club last night
to do battle with a youth of perhaps
half his years. The ancient gladiator
of the roped arena dragged himself
around the ring in a painful manner
for three rounds. Then the youngster
executed a few good stiff punches and
the old fellow went to the carpet for
keeps.
His name is George McCarthy, and
he came all the way from Woodland to
engage in the conflict. He was undet,
the wing of that good Samaritan, "Bid
dy" Bishop, and "Biddy" quietly tipped
it about that Mac could do very well
with his mitts and was a game one.
He was pitted against Olin Sullivan,
a youth who gained fame on the flat by
beating up a stevedore once or twice.
Sullivan was good to his fatherly op
ponent'for two rounds and all the pair
did was to hug each other and occa
sionally hand Referee Greggains a gen
tle clout. But Sullivan opened up tho
third round with a rush and kept rush
ing dad about the ring till he finally
settled in an easy corner and said good
night.
"Shy" Ryan and Fred Craig, a dusky
scrapper, were the next in Importance
to the heavys. "Shy" won the decision
because he was exceedingly wise an.l
landed most of the few punches. He
showed that he is possessed of some
cleverness, but had a wholesome fear
of Mr. Craig's wallop. Both men were
tired when the gong sounded.
Mike Synfy, \he Grecian athlete,
mixed it with "Kid" Parker, champion
of the newsboys' brigade. The lads put
up the fastest mill on the card. In
fact so close was the fight all the way
through that the judges disagreed and
Referee Greggains finally ordered' an
extra round. Synfy was handed ,the
palm of victory after the additional
round had been fought.
He landed the cleaner punches In
that period and had Parker all but
gone. Parker rallied some toward the
end of the round and had Synfy go
ing. All the way through the first
four rounds the boys mixed it viciously
and it looked like any one's fight. Both
were game and took a hard beating,
besides displaying much cleverness In
ducking swingfi.
Young McClure hit Billy Jensen so
hard in the first round that he was
doubled up and remained in this unique
position for fully a minute. Harry
McLoud broueht his right in contact
with George Henry's face In the third
and the latter had to go to the carpet
for good, after being downed at least
a dozen times. Charles McChesney
knocked out Charles Webber in three
rounds.

BURLINGAME POLOISTS WIN
FROM CRACK ENGLISH TEAM
Brilliant^ Playing by
Driscoll Moves
Crowd.
DEL MONTE, Feb. : 19.â The poloists
of the Burlingame Country Club scored
a brilliant victory over the English
players this afternoon' in the deciding
tournament game for the set of four
artistic cups. The honors for the day
were shared by Thomas A. Driscoll and
Walter S. Hobart of the winning team
with Captain Neil Haig.'bf the losers.
The score stood seven goals to two in
favor of the Whites at the beginning.of
the last period of play. Tom Driscoll
scored Immediately after the ball was
tossed in. The Reds then ran tip a se
quence of four goals, but their effort
came too late, as the bell sounded the
end of -the game with the score eight
goals to six. The teams were made up
of the following players:
Whitesâ C. Garland, T. A. Driscoll,
W. S. Hobart, John Lawson.
Redsâ B. Williams, W. McCreery, R.
Chaplin, Captain Nell ' Haig,
Referee," F. J. "Mackey ; * ' umpire, E.
Ezra; timekeeper, J. O. Tobin.
Walter Hobart and Tom Driscoll each
'scored four goals, Captain -Haig three,
Walter McCreery two and Basil Wil
liams one. Tom Driscoll electrified the
spectators by picking the ball out of a
scrimmage a few moments after play
commenced, and with three strokes he
scored the first goal. The Reds nearly
scored shortly after. Before the end of
the period Tom Driscoll scored again.,
IIOBART'S LONG DRIVK.
The Reds made a determined stand in
the second period and for a time
seemed to have the better of their op
ponents. It was not for long, however, 1
as the Whites soon regained possession
of the ball. Walter Hobart ran it down
the field and placed it for Garland, who
nearly scored. John Lawson wtts play-
Ing a brilliant game and was loudly
applauded for a stroke from the side
line in which the ball went just outside
the posts. Walter Hobart made up for
this lost opportunity just before the
end of the period by scoring from the
seventy-flve yard line.
He added another point to the score
of the Whites in the third period, send
ing the ball between the posts at an
awkward angle. When the ball was
first tossed in for this period Tom Dris
coll picked it out of the scrimmage and
ran it down the field, placing it for
Walter Hobart, who Just missed scor
ing. Captain Haig, the big, bluff Eng
lishman, who is so great a favorite
with the spectators, nearly scored from*
the seventy-five yard line. The play
all through this period u-as fast.
Captain Haig scored the first goal for
the Reds early in the fourth period on
a free stroke after a foul. Walter Slc-
Creory scored a second goal almost im
mediately on another free hit, this time
after the ball had been driven out of
the bounds on a safety hit. .
Tom Driscoll. on his big white-faced
pony Jim Jeffries, drew a round of ap
plause from his adherents early in the
fifth period. He picked the ball up
near the middle of the field and with
the other players strung out behind
him like the tall of a comet ran it
to the goal in three strokes. He was
in an awkward position for the de
cisive stroke, but as he ' galloped past
he sent the ball squarely" between the
posts. Soon after he placed the ball
for Walter Hobart, who sec-red on an
easy shot.
IIAIG PliAYS WELT...
Captain Haig proved a host in him
self in the last period and turned the
tide of battle decidedly in favor of the
Reds. Excitement was intense as point
by point ,the Reds drew up on their
opponents'. When the bell finally
sounded they were but two short of
the number required to make the score
a tie. The score in favor of Captain
Drigcoll's team was 8 to 6. After the
match a practice game was played.
The teams were:
Reds â Paul Clagstone, R. M. Tobln.

California Bowlers Vanquish
Team That Won Honors From
Pin Hitters of the South
Big bunches of coin, a championship
and other coveted possessions unex
pectedly changed their headquarters
last night when the heretofore Invin
cible Eugene bowling team took to the
distant pines before "Doc" McGrath's
California team.
From the first frame of game No. 1
there was nothing to It but the Cali
lornias. Splits and errors were in or
der from the Central Alley faction,
and it must be said that 'for cham
pionship bowling the play was decid
edly on the wane.
Three hundred and fifteen pins Is
the small margin by which the new
champs won out.* Leap must think
up some good kind of an excuse for
last night, though he did well himself.
He averaged 201 1-3 for the three
games, but supported by 156 and 164
scores, he didn't have a look in.
Lagarde was the bowling kid last
night and won all kinds of praise.
With a former championship individ
ual record of 694 for three games, he
tumbled the Dins last night for 725.
McOrath 'and Pickler, who are both
particularly delighted over the vic
tory, bowled well themselves, averag
ing 201 2-3 and 200 respectively.
Thorpe, the ''reliable man" from
the Central Alleys, fell down flat. After
having established the sensational
record of 300 pins on the same alleys
some months ago, he came through
with a 185 high score last night.
There's no the fact that some
thing was wrong last night. The
team couldn't seem to get together and
strikes were few and far between:
Birdsall bowled in the first game, but
after proving that the ball invariably
avoided the head i>in he effected a
getaway and was replaced by Eacret,
who was a trifle worse. ;
Kelly, Russell and "Sunbeam" Ber
telson were conspicuous by their sfb
sence. Diehl took Russell's place on
the score sheet, but failed to do so in
the games. The individual team aver
age of the Eugenes for the three
games ma 181-6-15 and for the Cali
fornUuj 202 5-15.

MANY PROMISING
BOXERS TO MEET
IN ROPED ARENA
Olympic Club Tournament Will
Begin in the Gymnasium
on Xext . Thursday Night
The coming amateur boxing tourna
ment of the Olympic Club should prove
a record breaker in this city. Already
a long list of entries have been received,
and a great many more boxers will
probably be signed up within the next
few days. The tournament will begin
on February 25 and continue for three
nights.
The star bout of the affair will be the
go between Andy Gallagher and Sam
Berger. Both these men are members
of the club and rivals for heavy-weight
honors. Berger is the present holder of
the title, and so far has successfully
defended It against all comers. He has
been very much In evidence lately and
has occupied a fair share of the atten
tion of the sporting public by his vic
tories and his alleged professional con
duct.
Gallagher, on the other hand, has
been laying low for a long time and
seems to have been all but forgotten
by the followers of the game. A fevt
months ago he occupied the center of
the stage, and after doing a lot of good
work suddenly faded out of the pub
lic's view.
. Gallagher's last victory was over
Walter Moreno at the San Francisco
Club some few months ago. He fought
a great battle that night, and although
not in condition for the mill defeated
his man easily. He has been working
hard for the meeting with Berger and
promises to be In the best of form
when the gong sounds.
So far there have. been but two en
tries In the heavy-weight class. In the
light heavy-weight class there are
three. Harry Chester, James Fox and C.
W. Sloan. Chester is an Olympic Club
man and well known. Sloan is a very
likely chap with a hard punch, and
Fox is looked upon as a surprise.
Following is a list of the entries for
the tournament up to date:

Third Battalion Goes to Colum
bus Barracks and First and

The site for the new target range for
truops Ftationod about the bay was
chosen yesterday. It is a line spot near
Point Bonita, on the Fort Baker reser
vation. The board "that had the subject
in hand v.a? composed of Colonel Will
iam L. Pitcher. Major Robert Â«C. Van
VJiel, Major John Bfgelow Jr., Captain
Samuel 1*. Faison and Captain Clarence
B. Dentler.
Until three years ago practice was
held on the range at the Presidio, but
as the building: of residences came
closer to the post, the range had to be
abandoned, and ever since then the
local target practice has been done
away with, so far as the Presidio
src'iinds are concerned. The nev/ range
will be put in order as soon as General
MacArthur gives hi.s sanction and
orders' the paymaster to produce the
necessary wherewithal to put the
grounds into condition.
The Twenty-seventh Infantry, Col
onel Sa:nuel H. Whitall. which arrived
home from llanila on the Logan last
Tuesday, is now departing for its East
ern posts. The Third Battalion left
yesttrday, bound for Columbus Bar
racks, Ohio, and the headquarters,
band and First and Second battalions
will leave to-day for Fort Sheridan.
They will go on two special trains, the
first leaving at 10:30 o'clock this morn
ing and the second at 1:30 o'clock this
afternoon.
The Klt^venth Infantry, which sailed
on the Thomas from Manila for this
port on February 1&, will be due here
about March 1?. The headquarters,
band and two battalions will go to
Fort D. A. Russell: two companies will
ko to Fort Mackenzie, Wyo. ; one com
pany to Fort YVashakie, Wyo.. and the
remaining company to Fort Niobrara,
Neb.
The marriage of Captain Charles
Young, Troop I, Ninth Cavalry, and
Miss Ada Mills of this city, came as a
great surprise to his brother officers at
the Presidio, as no intimation of the
event had been given out. Captain
Young is an able officer, highly es
teemed and respected.
The new army roster of troops of the
Department of California was issued
by Major John R. Williams yesterday:
It will he of great value to the army
people stationed here, and to those in
terested in army affairs.
Among: the officers who registered at
headquarters yesterday were Major Ed
ward T. Brown. Artillery Corps; Dfeu
tenant Thomas W. Brown. Twenty
seventh Infantry, on leave; Major
Charles G. Woodward. Artillery Corps,
fn route to Fort Sheridan, and Lieu
tenant George H. Shields Jr., Twelfth

range for Ord Barracks wiil soon be
commenced. General MacArthur has
ordered an appropriation of $1000 for
its construction, and work will be
begun at once.
Two hundred and fifty recruits, under
command of Captain C. G. Woodward,
â¢arrived Thursday from Columbus Bar

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY. FEBRUARY 20, 1904.
UNDER WRITERS ARE ANXIOUS
FOR SAFETY OF LA BRUYERE
French Bark Is Now Out (More Than. Five Weeks From Port Los
Angeles for Astoria in Spite of the Favorable Winds Pre
vailing and Is Quoted for Reinsurance at Fifteen Per, Cent
AMERICAN SHIP W. F. BABCOCK. WHICH IS MAKING A LONG PASSAGE FROM BALTIMORE FOR THIS
PORT AND IS NOW REINSURED AT 20 PER CENT. SHE WAS REPORTED ASHORE AT OUTSET OF
VOYAGE IN CHESAPEAKE BAY.
The French bark La Bruyere, now
out 35 days from Port Los Angeles for
Astoria, was quoted for reinsurance
yesterday at 15 per cent. Grave anx
iety is felt for the vessel, for with the
southeasterly winds that have prevailed
almost ever since she left the southern
port she should have made a fast pas
sage. There have been some unusually
heavy gales since the Bruyere sailed
and unless she shows up very shortly
her reinsurance cost will take a rapid
rise. She went to Port Los Angeles
from Cherbourg and was a long time
on the way. A high rate of reinsur
ance was paid r/n her and it was some
thing of a surprise when she showed
up. She had been unable to round
the Horn and had turned back, com
ing to this coast by way of the Cape
of Good Hope. She is notorious as a
sluggish sailer, but her present trip is
unaccountably slow. The Bruyere was
built in 1899 at Nantes and is a vessel
of 1738 tons register.
Nothing has been heard yet of the
overdue W. F. Babcock, now out 133
days from Baltimore for this port. She
is quoted at 20 per cent. The other
overducs are quoted as follows: Theo
dor, 30 per cent; Robert Rickmers, 15
per cent; General Mellinet, 10 per cent.

CHOICE SECTION
Improvement Club Is Organized
by Bepresentativc Men Dwell
ing in Pacific Heights District
PEOMISE OF ENTERPEISE
Senator Perkins Introduces a
M&isnre in Congress Appro
priating $50,000 for Presidio
In response to a call made by
Vanderlyn Stow, Livingstone Jenks,
Wallace Bradford and George W.
Turner, a meeting of the residents of
the Pacific Heights district was re
cently held at the United Crafts and
Arts Hall, on Presidio avenue, for the
purpose of organizing a Pacific Heights
Improvement Club. George W. Turner
was chosen temporary chairman and
Erwin M. Cooper temporary secretary.
Judge John R. Aitken, E. D. Bullard
and William Romayne were appointed
a committee on constitution and by
laws.
After an animated discussion on the
needs of the district, it was resolved to
postpone any action for permanent of
ficers until the regular meeting, on the
first ""'-"sday In March.
The district embraces the territory
bounded by California, Central avenue.
Presidio avenue and the, Presidio on the
north; also the district south of Union
street and immediately adjoining the
Presidio on the east.
This is one of the strongest improve
ment clubs that has been organized in
some time, and its membership em
braces many representative men of
San Francisco. It is predicted that it
will be the means^of making the dis
trict before mentioned one of the most
attractive parts of San Francisco.
It is surmised that the club will co
operate with United States army of
ficer* In efforts to obtain means for
the improvement and embellishment of
the Presidio section. Senator Perkins
recently introduced the following
measure in Congress:
"Be it enacted by the Senate and
House of Representatives of. the United
States of America in Congress assem
bled, that there be and there is hereby
appropriated out of any money in the
treasury not otherwise appropriated,
the sum of 550,000, the same to be used
under the direction of the Secretary of
War, for the improvement and beauti
fication of the grounds within the Pre
sidio military reservation at San Fran*
cisco, Cal."
It is expected that the California
delegation in Congress will succeed In
obtaining the appropriation. It is> a
topic of general comment in military
circles that the Presidio reservation
has not received the attention that it
deserves from the Government.

THE RUSSIAN CASH BOX.
â¢ What the Imperial Bank of Russia
Holds in Gold Coin.
Tie Wall -street Journal says:
. "The war betwet-n Russia and Japan makes
an Â«xam:nBtion of the position of the Im
!*-rial 'â â .-: h fit Russia of t-special interest. On
January 21 the Imperial Bank of Russia had
$144.250. 000 of cash in hand, of which $79.
â¢ tSSjOOO consisted cf gold. f2S.525.CKio of note*.
C2MBO.OO0 of silver coin, and $8,545,000 of
silver and copper coins of low value. Beyond
this amount cf cash it held S233.215.C00 of
irold bars, etc., and it poss-essed a balance of
?K4.O3f..Oi>O of gold abroad. This latter item
5r.surr.abiy means the balances of the Bank
of Berlin. Paris. London, and elsewhere, upon
which it could draw in pold if it desired to
<2o to. Including the gold in bars and coin,
the total amount cf gold held by the bank,
exclusive of that standing to its credit abroad.
Is $37o.T2sj.fÂ«Kf. and inclusive of the foreign
balances it amounts to f4."Â»4.7.i5.O<JO. On the
tnlier hand tLe notes in circulation amount
to ?! > KG.47<i.OOrt. The cash balance in the treas
ury is JITV.rrrOfJOO but beyond this, the turn
of 5:f2,:r;."i.<KÂ»Â» B Â»vas held by the treasuries ax
*i-oni-ifrnations.' Should hortll'.tips unfortu
nately rc-sult, the Government balances in the
bank would doubtless be drawn upon to pay
for sur;>!ies of food' and other produce se
cured from abroad. In the first place theee
*ift}pliep will probably be paid for out of ths
very large baJance of nearly $sr>,<KK',<A)O stand
ing to the credit of the Imperial Bank in for
Â«-;gn"mr>nÂ«y markets. Ani the actual gold re
â ervea of the bfink. amounting to a little
cter $350.00.000. would only be drawn upon
Â«'hep thest fon isn balances were exhausted.
In .-considering the possibility of gold exports
from Rusrsia it ha*, of eounse. to be bcrne in
rn'.nfi that th<? Russian obligations for- interest
nbroad are very Jarge. and that Russia is
compelled to ship a great deal more produce
xMu it receives in order to, mm its foreign
obligations. In recent years the excess of ex
ixirts rver im;>orts has befn kept down to a
relatively low figure by the ability of Russia
to borrow in the French market for the pur
po*e of meeting a portion of its interest obliga
tions. AVere Russia unable to borrow for a
eofisiderab'.e period, a large increase in its
exports, for the purjose of meeting Its interest
olilipatlor.B would be inevitable, unless the
ca*lt balances ttbfXid were greatly reduced
or gold was exported from Russia. Much un
certainty **xists at to how much Russia would
toe able to borrow abroad in the event of hcÂ«s
tdlties. and The indications jK>liit to the proba
bility that the foreign balances of thÂ» Rus
fcian Government and of the Imperial Bank
may have to be drawn ujÂ«on and that possibly
poid may be t-xported."

New York Stock Market.
NEW YORK. Feb. 19.â The Inaction of to
day's stock market was a natural sequence of
the behavior of the market on preceding days
of the we.*. The- efforts of the tratlers hav
inc proved unavailing either to depress or to
a<i.-Â»nce i>rices. they seemed to give up ths'.r
attempt to-day. Except Amalgamated Copper
and Brooklyn Transit, not a single stock of
first-rate iticortanee moved as vnuch as a
uoint away irom last nights level. Some cl
the inactive nocks made wide icssits and ;ii â¢â¢
Indicated the j.revaillns downward tendency
of prices, nearly Imperceptible though it waÂ«.
The ffrliliii: for foreign account was the most
conspicuous feature of the day and was a
measure of the uneasiness felt abroad over the
thn-at of complications of other great powers
in the bOBttUtlea in the Far East or in the
threatened outbreak in the Balkans. Private
cables reported much pressure upon the mar
kets both in Berlin and Paris, where some
fears were *aid to exist of financial embar
rassments. Both thoee money centers axe
larit-ly committed to Russian securities, both
State and industrial, and the fall In the
prices since the war broke out causes the ne
cessity of some- protective measures by their
holders. These measures seem to have extend
ed to tfcp selling of some American securities
which affects the New York market. The ef
fect of actual war news here seems unimpor
tant, but the wheat market sufficiently indi
cates the importance that would attach to the
involvement of other foreign powers.
The prospects cf a strong bank statement
had littlp effect on stocks. The indicated gain
of carh from the interior may be due to the
preparation of interior Government depositories
to transfer 20 per cent of their deposits to des
ignated New York bank? in response to the
call of the Secretary of the Treasury to pro
vide for the Panama canal payment. The ef
fect o' this operation will be seen, therefore
to increase !n the first place the cash In the
New -Jork hanks. The effect when the actual
rerrittanees shall be made to Panama stock
holders Is still matter Tor conjecture. The
rains fro->. the Subtreasury have been auu
rrented by the telegraphic transfer from Pan
Francisco nn account of Japanese gold This
Japanese pold is believed to be in payment for
purchase rf provisions in ti.is country But
it Is probable that payments In London for
.Japanese purchases thÂ»re are also involved
Japanese -old <- a n purchase sterling exchange
In New York at cheaper rate than the gold can
be transferred to London and Japan is fud
poseii to be anxious to conserve her deposits In
the Bank of England for future contingencies
This process mav also help to explain the
strength of Fterlin? at New York for several
days past. The late drive ugraln.it Amalga
mated Cor>Der and Brooklyn Transit gave the
market its onlv sien of activity and contrib
ute<l to the weak closing.

Future Grain and Provisions.
\ CHICAGO. 'Feb. 19.â Wheat for the May de
1 H\*ry to-day was at $1 03 a bushel, an ad
! vunce of 3%C'^%c over last night's close.
Other deliveries were also strong, the July
option at one time being up 3c, compared
I with yesterday's final quotations. Sharp ad
vances in foreign markets, due to- possible
war complications, were JÂ¥>tent factors in .xhe
; local situation. 'â  Competition among millers
! for wheat suitable for' the flour trade was
an equally vital Influence. May wheat closed
I at a net gain of 3 1 / iS3%e.
i On the wildest trading experienced since the
market started on its bullish course May
wheat to-day opened at $1J},1 01. The Initial
quotations were %c@l%c above yesterday's
Cl0 ?.m^Â«r^r'/ es - ~,. July Â°P ened \k@%c higher
, at lH)%6!)0Â«4c. The action of the market waa
foreshadowed by a sharp advance in prices
abroad. Liverpool wheat futures being quoted
l%Â£l>4c higher and London quotations closing
I lVfl-'ftc higher. . The growing scarcity of
good wheat throughout the country was an
added inspiration to the buyers. Eastern bid
ders for Oklahoma wheat made offers equal
to ft t. o. b. Galveston for hard wheat and
I met with no responses from country dealers.
j Reports from other sections showed that sim
ilar conditions applied to the greater part of
j the winter wheat region. Spring wheat mil
lers, owing to the greater scarcity of their
own special milling variety, were reported in
I close competition with millers In Kansas and
, Nebraska for the winter wheat of those States.
; All these considerations developed a bullish
â â  sentiment among local traders, the buying in
creasing as the price continued to rise. When
May wheat reached $1 01% the big Ions In
terest becam<- an open one. At one time
It looked as if the market was on the point
of breaking. After reacting to 99%e, how
ever, the price ~ wag again forced upward by
the urgent demand from shorts. Trading was
so large rfnd general that it was decidedly
j difficult to follow. Fluctuations In May were
j specially wide and it was necessary to go
I away over the market to fill orders. Prices
j climbed upward until the noon hour, when
the high point of the^flay was reached. May
selling at $1 03. Meantime July had risen to
03c. Some reaction resulted on heavy realizing
sales, but within the last few minutes- 01
trading May touched $1 03. The close was
j at $1 02% for May and at 92%c for July.
While the bull campalsm In wheat was in
full progress the enthusiasm in the corn mar
ket had died out temporarily. Not until late
in the day did the corn pit feel the effects
i of the bullish foreign news and the strength
J In wheat. There was big selling In May corn
: by one of the most prominent commission
houses, who were reported to have sold (JVei
a million bushels during the day. May closed
firm at 50%c. being %c higher. July showed
I greater strength and closed l%c higher at
i 54Â»/jÂ©54%c.
'. Oats were strong, but not especially active.
! May closed at 45 %c, %c higher.
j Provisions- felt the effect' of the war as
j much as the grain markets. May pork led in
, the advance, closing 42V&C higher at $15 57% ;
I per barrel, after selling between $15 17% and j
1 515 67%; May lard was up 12%c and rlbj

BARLEY â There was a lively market In
futures on the morning session with an ad
vance ranging from l%c In May to 4c In
December. It was due to the rise In Wheat
. and the prevailing . bullish eentlment In all
grains, and If current report on 'Change be
correct, to an attempt otr the part" of some
heavy holders of spot Feed to unload their
holdings at a good profit. The cash grain
did not sympathize with the advance and re
mained quiet and unchanged.

Poultry and Game. \
AH descriptions of. live Poultry, ruled firm at !
unchanged rates, receipts being light and the j
demand steady. Young chickens had the most !
call and occasional lots of exceptionally fine i
stock commanded a premium. Shippers of â 
dressed Turkeys made the usual mistake of
rushing in supplies in expectation of an extra
demand for Washington's birthday. Over 100
cases came In and dealers found it difficult to
dispose of second quality and "grassy'.' offer
ings, even at the minimum quotation. There
was quite & quantity of such stock still unsold
at the close.
Previous prices ruled for Game, the demand
and supply about balancing.

Butter, Cheese and Eggs.
Another decline in Butter Is noted and deal

local consumption and shipment. The lower
quotations have resulted In some business for
Los Angeles. Portland -and Puget Sound,
though the orders are small and scattering.
To-day's steamer for the north will take
about 700 cases of Eggs. The market con
tinues weak, with 22%c ruling for store and

In fresh fruits was \ - ery quiet. There was
some little Inquiry for large Navels for ship
ment to Honolulu on the steamer Alameda. out
to-day, but otherwise the market was feature- :
lese. The open market for Oranges reflected
the conditions that have prevailed for the past
week and the auction sale passed off quietly
and attracted but little on the street.

FILE THEIR PROTEST
Mnier & Zobelein Will Appeal to the
Board of General Appraisers
at Xcw York.
The Maier & Zobelein Brewing
Company of Los Angeles filed a pro
test yesterday with Customs Collector
Stratton against the assessment of
2 cents a pound duty on a
consignment of rice which arrived in
Ean Francisco on the Korea January
25. The rice was seized at. Los An
geles a'nd held for the payment of
$156S 20 duties, which the Appraiser
at this port found should have been
paid, instead of $205. which was paid
by the importer. This latter sum rep
resents the duty of one-quarter of a
cent per pound on broken rice, where
as . the Appraiser decided that the
groods were of higher grade than that
given and that the duty was 2 cents
per pound, ./v \
J. L..BJey of C. D. Bunker & Co.
states that the rate of duty at which
the rice was purchased was given to
Maier & Zobelein as being a quarter
of a cent a pound and that they were
entirely in ignorance of the fact that
they would be compelled to pay 2
cents per pound.
The detained rice at Los Angeles
. I 1 -- release <J upon the payment of
$1363 20, the balance due. The con
signee* will appeal to the board of

INSANITY PLEA
WILL BE MADE
Alexander B. Garnett's At
torney Indicates Part of the
Defense on -Murder Charge
It was apparent from a remark made
by W. D. Grady in Judge Lawlor's
court yesterday that when the trial of
Alexander B. Garnett, charged with the
murder of Major J. M. McClung, takes
place an attempt will be made to show
that the defendant was temporarily in
sane at the time of the shooting and
that insanity has existed in his family.
This Is the inference from the class, of
depositions desired by the defense.
The defendant was In court yesterday
to plead, but Grady filed a demurrer to
the information on the same grounds
as on his motion to dismiss, which was
denied on Thursday. The Judge over
ruled the demurrer and the defendant
pleaded not guilty.
Grady asked that the trial be post
poned for sixty days to enable him to
get the deposition of Mrs. Elizabeth
Hitchcock-Coit, who is said to be in
Paris.
"Why, you told us a few days ago,"
Interrupted Assistant District Attorney
Ferral. "that she was in New York.
Now you say she is in Paris, and I sup
pose the next time you will say she Is
in St. Petersburg."
The Judge said he was willing to
grant a reasonable continuance, but he
thought sixty days was too long.
"Well, your Honor," said* Grady, "it Is
essential to the defendant that Mrs.
Colt's deposition. should be taken. Be
sides I desire depositions from persons
In Colorado Springs, Colo., In Arizona
and In West Virginia who have known
the defendant and his family, and that
will take time."
The Judge set the case for trial on
March 21, to which Grady took an ex
ception, and Intimated that meantime
he would renew his motion for the tak
ing of Mrs. Colt's deposition and the
other depositions.
Warrant for Edward Magnus.
Dr. Dudley Tait, secretary of the
State Board of Medical Examiners, se
cured a warrant from Police Judge Ca
baplss yesterday for the arrest of Ed
ward Magnus, who holds a Job under
the Board of Health, for practicing
medicine -without a license. Dr. Tait
said that Magnus had twice failed to
pass the necessary examination.
Burglars to Be Sentenced.
Judge Lawlor yesterday denied the
motion for a new trial in the case of
Edward Yarrow and Clifford Meldrum,
convicted of burglary, and set next
Wednesday for sentence. They enter
ed the room of George Olson in a lodg
ing-house at 310 Montgomery avenue
on the mornins of April 6 last.

DOCTORS GIVE
THEIR OPINION
Testify at Trial of Edmond de
Labrousse, Charged With the
Murder of Miss Marie Jordan
EVIDENCE IN REBUTTAL
District Attorney Byington's
Witnesses Tell of Accused's
Sanity Prior to the Murder
The trial of Edmond de Labrousse
for the murder of Miss Marie Jordan
was resumed In Sup^lor- Judge
Dunne's court yesterday morning.
Mrs. Vlctorlne de Labrousse, mother
of the prisoner, was the first witness of
the day and was re-examined as to her
son's mental condition on the day. and
subsequent to the commission of the
murder. Mrs. De Labrousse said she
remained in the hospital witfi [ him
dally from 6 o'clock in the morning
until midnight, but she could get no
answers from him until the day of the
funeral of Miss Jordan, when, at a re
mark by her daughter about the
burial, he "started," and when told in
reply to his inquiry that it was Miss
Jordan's funeral -they had discussed-,
he fainted. \
In answer to District Attorney By
ington, .witness . admitted that her son
said "My God!" when he realized it
was Miss Jordan that had been buried.
SAYS HE WAS INSANE.*
Dr. Canac-Marquis, late of the
French Hospital, was called by Attor
ney Roche to answer a hypothetical
question, which took the form of a
history of the prisoner's life from 2
years of age up to the time he took
Miss Jordan's life.
Dr. Canac-Marquls in replying to
the question said:- "He was madly in
sane."
-District Attorney Byington cross-ex
amined Dr. Canac-Marquis, who said
if a man were sane before the commis
sion of a crime and b'ecame uncon
scious as a result of a self-inflicted
shot he would be conscious of his act
on regaining consciousness and would
speak of it, but if such circumstances
surrounded, the act of an insane man
he would'-fiot hÂ£ cognizant of the act
for which he was responsible, nor
would he speak of it on regaining con
sciousness.
Dr. Canac-Marquis admitted that
the hypothetical question was put to
him at his house the previous night
by the prisoner's counsel, Mr. Roche,
arid he then concluded that De La
brousse was "madly insane." Dr.
Canac-Marquis gave it as his opinion
that because he was madly insane the
prisoner did not know he shot his
sweetheart.
BYIXGTOX'S RETORT.
District Attorney Byington remarked
here that the prisoner took particular
pains to shoot his sweetheart first be
fore turning the revolver on himself.
Dr. Clarence D. Potter testified to
having performed an operation on De
Labrousse for appendicitis, though wit
neBs said he was not afflicted with the
ailment. In reply to District Attor
ney Byington, Dr. Potter admitted that
De Labrousse tola him he had had at
tacks of appendicitis.
Attorney Roche then recalled Dr. Ed
win Bunnell, to whom he put the same
hypothetical question as asked Dr. Car
nac-Marquis.
Dr. Bunnell said in his opinion the
subject of the question would be insane
and could not distinguish between right
from wrong nor appreciate the char
acter of his act.
The District Attorney put the follow
ing question to the witness:
"If a person remains in his room up
to 11 o'clock and writes letters of his
intention to commit suicide and then
goes out to meet a lady within a few
minutes of a certain time he knows
she will be at a corner and he walks
along and takes her arm and she re
fuses him, and he fires three shots at
her, killing her. then twice turns the
pistol on himself and It doesn't go off;
then he looks into the L^rrel, dis
cl/arges another shot toward the
ground and then another at his own
head, would such a person be Insane?"
Dr. Bunnell replied: "I believe he
became dangerously insane when he
fired the shot. I don't believe he knew
what he was doing."
SURE HE WAS RATIONAL.
The District Attorney then called wit
nes^ in rebuttal. >
J. G. Eagleson, by whom the pris
oner was employed for three months
the beginning of 1903. swore that De
Labrousse was rational, though easily
excited. W. T. Gardner, a salesman;
H. J. Webster and R. J. Alexander
spoke of the rational mental condition
of De Labrousse while in the employ
of Eagleson and as to his doing his*
duty satisfactorily. â¢
M. J. Smith said that between July
and August last the prisoner's conduct
and speech were "very rational." Os
car Wolf, gents' furnishing goods, said
he employed De Labrousse from July
till August, 1903. . He found his con
duct" and talk rational and he per
formed his duties satisfactorily.
John T. Gibson said the prisoner was
in his employ the Saturday night pre
ceding the shooting of Miss Marie Jor
dan, and his conduct was then rational.'
Gibson said he considered De Labrousse
one of the best clerks he ever had.
P. B.- Bennett, 1027 Larkln street,
knew De Labrousse five years. He was
at witness' house about September 10
and remained there three hours. His
conduct was "very jovial" and he en-
Joyed himself and passed a very pleas
ant evening. His' conversation and con
duct were rational. â 
At this point the hearing was. con
tinued until Tuesday morning.

SECRET BRIDE
LEAVES HOME
Miss Alice Thompson Quietly
3Iarries t â¢ Frederick Kuhl and
Her Parents Become Angry
GROOM OF NOBLE BLOOD
Bride Is a Niece of the Cele
brated Colonel Arthur Lynch,
a Boer War Veteran of Note
Pretty Alice Thompson, daughter of
Captain and Mrs. W. J. Thompson. of
this city and descendant of illustrious
ancestry, has fallowed the advice of
Emerson, who sdys, "Give all to love
friends, kindred, dogs," for she is now
Mrs. Frederick Kuhl, this despite the
absence of parental blessings. '
Miss Thompson married the man of
her choice on February 1, though it is
whispered that a man with a longer
purse appeared on the scene and that
he would have been more to the liking
of the young woman's parents. How
ever, it is possible that the fact that
the wedding, took place without bans
or other publicity may have had a
stronger influence than anything else
in, determining Captain and Mrs.
Thompson to invite their daughter to
forsake the parental roof-tree for the
house of Kuhl. Whether the . secret
marriage or the defiance of their
wishes moved the parents is not
known, but for some reason Mrs. Kuhl
was invited to forsake the home of her
childhood and join her husband.
It ]Â»â  said that the romance which
thus culminated in a secret wedding
began three years ago and at the out
set Mr. Kuhl was a welcome guest at
the Thompson household, and that it
was the accepted plan to have a home
wedding on December 6.
â¢ Shortly prior to that date, however,
the Thompson friendship for the pros
pective groom began to cool and when
he was finally forbidden the house
knowing ones whispered of another
suitor, who had "money to burn," -and
whose wealth and station made him a
desirable "partner for the daughter of
the house. Then it was that Mr. Kuhl
and his fair intended decided to shape
their own destiny, so on February 1
they fled to San Mateo and were
secretly married by Rev. Father Calla
han. â¢%-â â ; i.
Mr. Kuhl is a native of Berlin and is
the descendant of a noble family,, his
father, the late Carl Kuhl. having
served on the German Emperor's staff
for forty-three years. He is an engi
neer and electrician and is also a fine
linguist. Until quite recently he was
a member of the Engineers' Division
of. the Naval "Reserve.
Mrs. Kuhl is a niece of the cele
brated Colonel Arthur Lynch, ex-mem
ber of Parliament, who served in the
Boer army during the Boer war, and,
being later accused of treason and cast
into prison, was released through the
intervention, of Sir Thomas Lipton.
Besides being witty and personally
charming, Mrs. Kuhl Is accomplished
musically, her talent in that line
amounting almost to genius.
Mr. and Mrs. Kuhl are staying for
the present with his sister, Mrs. Benno
Hlrsch.
Hotel 'St. Francis.
The Hotel St. Francis, on Union Square, is now
receiving the finishing touches at the hands of
an army of decorators, furnishers and mechan
ics, and every effort is being put forth to have
it ready for opening early in March. All ele
vators and staircases have been Klven over to
the use of workmen, and the management has
been compelled to announce to all who have al
ready st-cured apartments, as well as to the
public, that for the ensuing ten days the hotel
will not be open for inspection. â¢

SAYS THAT HE IS BEING
OVERCHARGED FOR WATER
Consumer Complains to Board of Su
pervisors of Tactics of the Spring
Valley AVater Company.
H. Jenkins filed a complaint^ with
the Supervisors yesterday to the ef
fect that the Soring Valley Water
Company is making him pay over
charges on water supplied to his
house on' Natoma street. Jenkins
says he gets a notice every two weeks
to pay from $14 to * 25 for water,
whereas the regular charge hag been
$6 35. -The company afterward set
tles the excess charge of $5, which
Jenkins has been paying monthly.
Jenkins concludes by saying:
"It is pretty hard to be robbed. in
this way and because I refused to pay
the extra charge last month the com
pany threatens to shut the water off."

THINKS SPEAR
WAS NOT FAIR
Attorney Treadwell Says Har
bor Commissioner Used His
PJace to Help Brother-in-Law
The application of Foster & Orear
for -an injunction restraining the
Board of Harbor Commissioners from
taking from them the news stand
privilege in the ferry building and
giving It to James Roney, brother-in
law of Harbor Commissioner Spear,
was taken under submission by Judge
Seawell yesterday after an argument
of several hours. Pending his deci
sion the temporary injunction issued
the day the complaint was filed will
remain in effect.
Attorney Treadwell appeared on be
half of the firm and Attorney Bert
Schlesinger appeared for Rooney.
Attorney Davis represented the board.
Treadwell's argument consisted main
ly of an attack on Spear, enlarging
that he had deliberately used his po
sition to favor Rooney, thus making
it impossible for his clients to secure
an even chance. He also charged
that in awarding the privilege the
board had completely overlooked the
right of the plaintiffs to enter into
competition and had refused to ac
cept the bid of $1500 made by Foster
& Orear. The board awarded the priv
ilege to Rooney for Sll'SO. informing
t,he plaintiffs that their bid of $1500
had arrived too late for consideration.
Schlesinger, in answer, contended
that the Commissioners were acting
within their rights in awarding the
privilege to Rooney. They have a
perfect right, he said, to give the priv
ilege to whom they see fit, and there
is no law to compel them to seek
competitive bids.
"It was a good thing for the, State,"
he said, "that Harbor Commissioner
Spear has a brother-in-law. Other
wise California would \be out a consid
erable amount every month. It was
only when Rooney had been given the
privilege that the State learned the
real value." -^ ' â¢
Continuing, Schlesinger said that
the equities in the matter justified the
action of the board and that the plain
tiffs had no right at this time to ques
tion its acts.
"The plaintiffs." he said, "were just
a little bit too slow with their appeal
to the court. They should have ap
plied for an injunction when the mat
ter was before the board and not
after the award had been made."
Both sides submitted numerous au
thorities in support of their conten
tions.
Tells of the Irish.
J. W. Lundy gave' an interesting lec
ture on "Ireland and the Irish" be
fore a large audience at the Alham
bra Theater last evening.
The lecture, which makes the 169th
given by Mr. Lundy, was illustrated
by a good collection of stereopticon
slides that were greatly appreciated
by his audience, the majority of whom
were Irish.
The lecture was given under the
auspices of the California Camera
Club.
