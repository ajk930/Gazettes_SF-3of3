HAMMOND DOWNS RIVALS
IN BIG MINING CONCERN
Crocker and Bradley Are Ousted From Control
Noted Expert Plans
a Successful
Coup.
TURNS OUT THOSE
WHO PUT HIM OUT
Short but Exciting
Fight in Dredge
Company.
Another chapter was added yesterday
t'- the short but interesting history of
the bitter fight being waged between
John Hays Hammond, th* well-known
mining engineer and representative* of
the GuggenheJm syndicate,' on the one
hand, and Banker Will Crocker and
Fred W. Bradley. Hammond's former
protege, and their respective business
associates on the other. The. fight has
been over the control of the Orovllle
Gold Dredging and Exploration Com
pany. which owns a valuable tract, of
dredging land near the town of Oro
ville. and involves many other promi
nent men on both .rides of the country.
Hammond came West- several weeks
ago with the avowed purpose of fight
ing Bradley and Crocker to a finish,
and that he carried out. his intentions is
ehown in the fact that he has suc
ceeded in ousting Bradley from the
presidency of the company and reor
ganized the corporation with his own
friends at its head. ..*-â¢"'
The trouble between Hammond and
Brae and Crocker started about fif
teen months ago. when Hammond, who
v.as then in th*Â» East, suddenly learned
that Bradley was preparing to get con
trol of the dredcin^ company. Although
Hammond and his friends held control,
Bradley, It v.as charged, violated an
agreement pet forth in the company's
minutes by celling a meeting of the di
rectors and disposing of 40,000 shares
of the treasury stock, taking 20.000 him
eÂ«lf and selling the other 20.000 to J. W.
Goodwin and Joseph Holden. By this
means Bradley was able to . re-elect
himself president and general manager
of the property, positions he held until
yesterday afternoon.
IX'OI.ITTI.I. LENDS AID.
Through J. E. Doolittle, the well
known local mining expert. Hammond
end his Eastern friends immediately
brought suit and petitioned for an or
der enjoining Bradley from using the
alleged fraudulently issued treasury
etock. and in this suit Will Crocker,
the banker, and several of Bradley's
friends were made codefendants. The
Injunction, after a bitter fight, in which
come of the most prominent local at
torneys participated, was denied by
Judge Sloss, who, however, recom
mended that the "case proceed for reg
ular trial. Since then the case has been
pending, awaiting the arrival of Ham
mond from the East. When he came to
San Francisco three weeks ago he was
accompanied by Ernest A. Wiltsee and
Chester A. Beatty. two of his business
confidants, who are interested with him
fn the dredging property, - but it was
supposed 'that their presence here was
In connection with other properties in
the north.
The fact has since been revealed,
however, that Hammond was negotiat
ing with Goodwin for his 10.000 shares
of stock. A deal was effected and late
last week Hammond quietly arranged
with his attorney, Jesse W. L-ilienthal,
and J. E. Doolittle for a neat little
coup. Hammond departed for the East
Saturday, but just before his leaving a
call for a meeting of the stockholders
of the company was issued and yester
day afternoon found Doolittle and
Lilienthal, armed with bundles of
proxies, seated in Bradley's office,
awaiting the opening of the stockhold
ers* meeting 1 .

In less than ten minutes' time the>
had voted Bradley out of the presi
dency and Installed Doolittle in his
p!aoe. elected L-ilienthal vice president
and selected a board of directors of
their own liking.
Later the company's books were
moved across the tenth floor of the
Crocker building to the offices of Doo-

A BITTER business feud be
tween John Hays Ham
mond, consulting engineer of
the Guggenheim syndicate,
and Fred W. Bradley, presi
dent of the Bunker Hill and
Sullivan m'nes and Tacoma
smelter, reached an exciting
climax y:sterday, when Ham
mond and his associates suc
ceeded in getting control of
the Oroviile Gold Dredging and
Exploration Company. Bradley
was promptly ousted as the
company's president and man

and other property were car
ried off by the victors.

resentatives in the new board of direc

ienthal and James H. Jennings, while
the minority, consisting of Bradley and
Will Crocker, is represented by the
first mentioned and W. R. Berry of the
c rocker- Wool worth Bank, which is a
large shareholder in the mining com
pany. It was partly through Will
Crocker's assistance that Bradley
gained control of the company and in
â .ing Bradley Hammond had to di
rect his fight aJso against Crocker.
Among the Eastern people who are
associated with Hammond in the Oro

one of New York's famous lawyers; J.

While in this city John Hays Ham
mond, acting as the representative of
the Guggenheims of New York, com
pleted the long-pending negotiations
for the purchase by the smelter trust
of the Selby Smelting and Lead Works.
Before he left here last Saturday he
procured all the papers preliminary to
a formal transfer of the stock of the
local concern to his principals, and it
is expected that the trust will begin to
direct the control of the Selbv works
within the next month.
Although persistent denials have
been made, it has been known by a
number of persons in this city for sev
eral months that the Guggenheims
were quietly negotiating for the Selby
works, including its plant at Vallejo
Junction and its lead works and assay
office in this city.
Hammond came West to complete
the deal, and as soon as he had the
necessary papers he started East. The
conditions of the deal are known to
only a few, but this much was learned
yesterday: The works are to be ope

Fifty Employes of

Rescners Find Fifteen Bodies
and Deal May Num

Investigation Disproves Early Thfory
That the Disas er Was Not Due
to Natural Causes.
BENTON, 111.. April 3.â Fifty miners
were entombed to-day in Joseph Lett
er's mine at Zeiglgr by an explosion of
gas, and it is probable that thirty or
forty of the buried men are dead. Thus
far fifteen bodies have been found. The
explosion was due to the fact that the
Leiter mines are not worked on Sun
day, thus allowing gas to accumulate
in the lower workings.
When between thirty-five and forty
five miners hVI defended into the
mine to-day to resume work a terrific
explosion blew the timbers about the
mouth of the mine high into the air.
One of the steel cages was blown to the
surface from the bottom of a 500-foot
shaft. The shock of the explosion was
felt at Benton. twelve miles distant.
One miner was killed and four were
severely injured at the mouth of the
shaft in which the explosion occurred.
The work of rescue was begun at once
by miners who were arriving at the
time the explosion took place, but the
main shaft was so badly wrecked that
rescue work has to be carried on
through the air shafts.
There was much excitement among
the miners after the disaster, because
there had been a strike of long dura
tion and many conflicts had occurred
between the strikers and non-union
miners. An all-day investigation, how
ever, tends to show that the catastro
phe was due to the accidental explosion
of accumulated gas.
To-night thirty-one coffins, accompa
nied by an undertaker, arrived in Zeig
ler.
Among the dead are James Reyburn.

which the finer nuggets found their
way into the chickens' gizzards.
Smith was in Gold Hill to-day with
a quantity of dust taken from chick

LOUISVILLE. Ky., April 3.â United
States secret service men in Louisville
are investigating the case of a strange
man who appeared on Saturday at the
Young Men's Christian Association
building and made remarks which led
to the belief that he intended some
harm to President Roosevelt on his
visit here to-morrow. The man is
about 45 years old and was dressed as
a laborer. He asked for aid. but did
not appear deserving, and nothing was
done for him. Then he said to Gar
land Craig, office secretary of the as
sociation, that he intended to stop the
President during the parade.
"I've got something to ask him," the
man is reported to have said, "and
he'll have to answer."
Five secret service men from Wash
ington will look after the safety of
the President while here. Two of them
are already here and three are on the
train which will arrive to-morrow. In
addition the entire detective force of

the President.
WASHINGTON, April 3.â With
cheers and good wishes resounding at
the Pennsylvania depot, the President
at 9:05 o'clock this morning, on a spe
cial train, started on his trop through
the South.
The train, which is one of the finest
the Pennsylvania Hailroad ever has
sent out of Washington, consists of
three cars â the President's private car
Rockele, the Pullman sleeper Forest
and the combination baggage and buf
fet car Viceroy. It is handsomely fitted
and contains every known appliance to
insure the comfort and safety of the

HARRISBURG, Pa. April 3â "l
don't exactly say that I need a rest,
but I am going to take one in the open,
under God's blue heaven." said Presi

platform by his special train at the
Pennsylvania station, and conversing
with Congressman Olmstead. United
State? Attorney Mc<"arrH! and United
State? Marshal Leonard, in the pres
ence of a great crowd that gathered at
the station to meet him. It was sug
gested to the President that things
would go along in a smooth manner
even if he were absent.
"Oh, things will be all right." he
said. "I have left Taft sitting on the
lid keeping down that Santo Domingo
matter."
When the train stopped th*> Presi
dent stepped from the platform, with
the remark to a Secret Service officer:
"Pass right along now and if this
crowd isn't too big I'll shake with all
of you."
At this there was a rusn to shake
hands' with him. When some little
girls were handed up to him he said.
"God bless the children," and then
turning to Congressman Olmstead he
added: "You know I believe in these
children."
To one old soldier with a button in
his coat thÂ« President said, "How are
you, comrade?"
As the train moved off one man pro
posed three cheers for "Teddy." which
were given with a will, and the Presi
dent laughed heartily at the familiar
ity. His last remark as the train got
up speed was a hearty "So long, boys;
good-by."

Statement Scores Vice Presi

NEW YORK. April 3. â The most
important development in the Equit
able Life Assurance Society's affairs
to-day was the announcement to-night
by Uovernor Higg;ns at Albany and
by President James W. Alexander of
the society in this city that Stute Su
perintendent of Insurance Francis
Hendricks had begun an investigation
of the company's affairs.
This wai followed by the introduc
tion in the Stat* Senate to-night uf
a resolution providirg for a legislative
investigation of the Equitable. The
resolution was presentt-d by Senator
Brackett.
Hendricks returned to Albany last
night after several . days spent in con
ference with those interested in Equi
table matters in this city. The. Gov
ernor's announcement came less than
twelve â  hours after the superintendent
had reached his Albany office and was
followed by a formal announcement
from Hendricks' office in this city to
night to the same. effect.
â  This action by the State authorities
follows a request ma/ie by Alexander
to. Superintendent Hendricka by letter
on February^ 3 i. and by Hyde in a later
letter 'iÂ«Â»Â«iÂ«tit : of; which, .vas.
made last Saturday night _i
â In an authorized : statement â the
first . Alexander. â¢ has ; made since the
State .-Superintendent \ was called into
the'eontroversy-r-the president of the
Equitable says that the . investigation
by Hendricks "is now in prosrress."
. â¢Its result." he adds, will establish
the- truth .or falsity of many matters
which are now being alleged Â»n the
one hand and controverted: on thÂ«
other."
' He takes occasion to deny come of
the statements made formally by Hyde
last Saturday night. He says:
"He (Hyde) says that the charges
that have been made against him have
their origin in an effort by individuals
to obtain control of the Equitable So
ciety . and. its assets. On the part of
myself and other officers of th-Â» society
who are.. associated with me in this
movement I desire to deny that our
action is influenced by any motive ex
cept a desire to discharge our Â»luty as
officers of the society.
"Mr. Hyde further says that he has
exercised no power except with the
president's '. concurrence. In reply I
assert that Mr. Hyde's usurpation of
the. president's authority and his ha
bitual action without the consent, or
the knowledge of the president of the
society are among the subjects of se
rious criticism t against his conduct a3
an officer ,of the society."

statues passed ; from one dealer to-an
other, until Sir"' Thomas Dewar picked
them up a few months ago.
Du-ing Sir Thomas' recent visit to
the T'nited States he was greatly im
pressed by the esteem in which Burns
is held there and promptly decided to
present to New York the two effigies
of the poet which had just come into
his possession. They are now standing
side by side in one of the Dewar ware
houses here and are to be shipped to
the United States as soon as paokinK

A part of Sir Thomas' collection of
articles associated with Robert Burns
already is in New York. His Fifth

for which he refused $5000 from an
American collector. He is now nego
tiating for the purchase of the chair
in which the poet sat before he died

Dangerous Waters
LETTER FROM ADMIRAL
Vladivostok the Haven to
Which He Hopes to
Take His Fighting Craft
ST. PETERSBURG, April 4, 2 a. m.
A letter from Vice Admiral Rojest
vensky to his wife, which has just
been received here, indicates that the
departure of the second Pacific squad
ron from Madagascar waters is final,
and that it is now on the way to Vladi
vostok.
In the letter the admiral wrote that
the sailing of the squadron had been
fixed for March 19, but. naturally, he
avoided mention of the route which it
was* intended to fallow on the voyage
eastward. The Admiralty yesterday
admitted knowledge of this determi
nation and stated that no contrary or
ders had been sent.
It is understood that a rendezvous
with Vice Admiral Nebogratoff's divi
sion of the Baltic squadron is not con
templated.
RUSSIANS EXPECT BATTLE.
Heavy Japanese Movement in Progress
, on Their Flanks.
GUNBHU PASS, April 3.â A renewal
->f fighting is expected shortly. The
concentration of the Russian army is
complete, with its advance lines south
of the station of Sipingnai, seventy
four miles north of Tie Pass. The
Japanese are screening their move
ments well by means of cavalry, and it
is difficult to locate the bulk of their
army.
A heavy movement seems to be In
process on the Russian flanks. The
railroad station at Chengtufu, forty or
fifty miles above Tie Pass, is occupied
by Japanese artillery, but so far as
ascertainable the cavalry does not
cover a large body of troops.
A two-wheeled cart of the Russo-
Chinese Bank containing more than
$2,500,000, which was lost during the
retreat from Mukden, has been found,
but the cash chest of the Ninth Regi
ment of Artillery is still undiscovered.
A movement of Chinese bandits, led
by Japanese officers, through Mon
golia, in the direction of Tsitsihar, 300
miles west of Harbin, has been re
ported and pressure is being brought
by the Japanese in China for an open
alliance with Japan. Yuan Shih Kai,
Governor of Pechili Province, and
General Ma, â¢ commander of the Chi- ;
nese forces on the frontier, are said to
be at the head of this agitation.
General Linevitch's headquarters
are in General Kuropatkin's old train.
PRINCE DEMANDS TRIAL.
Ouktomsky Disclaims Responsibility
for Naval Disaster.
ST. PETERSBURG. April 3. â Rear
'â Admiral Prince- â¢ Ouktomsky has ar
rived in St. Petersburg and has de
manded a trial by public court-martial
to clear himself of the charge of re
sponsibility flfcr the losses sustained by
the Port Arthur squadron on August
:10 last. He denies that he gave the
order to return to Port Arthur. On
the contrary, the admiral maintains
that after Rear Admiral Withoeft's
death he intended to break through
i the line of Admiral Togo and go to
j Vladivostok. .
When the Russian battleship Czare
vitch became unmanageable, throwing
the Russian ships into confusion,
Ouktomsky signaled "follow me."
Darkness fell while he was straighten
ing his line when, finding all the ships
except the battleships Pobieda and
Poltava had headed back to Port Ar
thur, he had no alternative but to re
turn himself, Ouktomsky says he was
relieved of his command a fortnight
later because his official report was
too brief.
WAR'S INNOCENT VICTIMS.
One Hundred Thousand Chinese
Homeless and Destitute.
GENERAL OKU'S HEADQUAR
TERS, April 3. â There is much suf
fering among the Chinese in the vicin
ity of Mukden. Scores of villages
were destroyed in the recent fighting
and 100,000 Chinese are homeless and
destitute. The Chinese Government is
now feeding and housing 60,000 refu
gees at Mukden and also supplying
seed grain. There is but little pros
pect for good crops this season, owing
to a lack of farm animals and imple
ments. The Japanese are employing
thousands of Chinese and paying them
liberally.

GROWING WRATH
OF THE FRENCH
Republic Chafes Under the
Threat Conveyed in Em
peror William's Address
AWAITS NEXT MOVE
Evident Purpose of the
Paris Government Is to
Adopt a Passive Attitude
PARIS, April. 3. â The Morocco inci
dent is daily making a deeper impres
sion, and while calmness continues to
prevail, there is a growing sense of the
rudeness of the shock which Emperor
William's visit to Tangier and his
declarations give to French policies.
However, for the present it is evident
that the purpose is to adopt a passive
attitude and await the development of
events. This was shown by. a confer
ence; at the Foreign Office to-day be
tween Foreign Minister Delcasse and
several Deputies, who wished to ques
tion him in the Chamber concerning
Morocco. The Foreign Minister asked
for an adjournment of the questions,
saying there was nothing to add to
what he had already stated in the
Senate. Accordingly the questions
were indefinitely postponed.
The Temps to-night says the au
thoritative version of Emperor Wil
liam's remarks at Tangier makes it
useless to deny the disobliging charac
ter of such words, which constitute
almost the maximum short of openly
quarreling with France that William
II could attempt in order to be dis-.
agreeable.
However, the general tone of the
press is singularly free from belliger
ent or menacing talk.
ST. PETERSBURG, April 3.â The
developments resulting from Emperor
William's speech at Tangier on Fri
day continue to attract great discussion
in the press and in diplomatic circles.
The sober view is that the German
Emperor seized on a favorable op
portunity to read France a lesson for
leaving Germany out of consideration
in the French-British understanding
regarding Morocco, with a view pos
sibly of compelling France to make
a permanent renunciation of her as
pirations regarding Metz and Alsace-
Lorraine; also with the practical pur
pose of securing a vote in the Reich
stag next fall for a larger naval pro
gramme. There w no serious idea that
the incident may lead to a conflict.
With Russia enfeebled France will
have to look to Great Britain to play
the role of protector assumed by Rus
sia when Germany threatened her in
1575, and there is a good deal of specu- j
h.tion on the subject of the new group
ing of the powers.
The home papers, however, declare
that while the British press may blus- j
ter. Great Britain has had her .quid !
pro quo in Egypt and will leave France {
to take care of herself.
LONDON, April 4.â The correspond
ent at Tangier of the Times asserts
that the correct version of Emperor
William's conversation with represen- j
tatives of the Sultan of Morocco is as \
follows: j i
The Emperor declaÂ«-pfT that he bad-.]
come expressly to Tangier to assert ;
that he would maintain the absolute I
equality of German economic and com
mercial rights and that he would not
allow any power to obtain preferential
advantages. The Sultan, he said, was
the free sovereign of a free country
and Germany would insist on always
carrying on her affairs direct with him
and would never allow any power to
act as an intermediary.

JEALOUS MAN
MAKES THREATS
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES, April 3.â Traffic
Manager J. McMillan of the Hunting
ton lines to-day swore to a complaint
against George Klrby of Huntington
Park and a warrant was issued for the
latter's arrest on a charge of threaten
ing McMillan's life.
Kirby is 55 years old and possesses
considerable wealth. He became pos
sessed of the notion that McMillan was
altogether too attentive to Mrs, Kirby
and that he had shown -her favors,
among which was that of stopping fast
trains for her at points which were not
stopping places for other passengers.
Mrs. Kirby is considerably younger
than her husband and is quite at
tractive.
Kirby stormed into McMillan's office
and demanded to see him. When the
traffic manager appeared Kirby began
a tirade of profanity and abuse which
drove the female stenographers out of
jpffic*. He kept one hand on his
hip pocket, as if holding a weapon, and
! declared he would kill McMillan if he
ever heard of his even speaking to his
wife.

WILLIAJJ J. RAFFEKTT. Notary Public .PRESIDENT APPOINTS NEW CANAL BOARD
Seven flee Chosen, but the Work Will
Practically Be Done by Three.
PANAMA CANAL COMMISSION APPOINTED BY THE
NT TO TAKE THE PUA.CE OF THE OLD BOARD, WHICH DID NOT
MAKE SATISFACTORY PROGRESS ON THE ISTHMUS.
WASHINGTON, April The Presi
dent has carried out his plans for the
reorganization of the Isthmian Canal
Commission as to the personnel and
business methods generally. He fol
lowed the lines of the legislation he
suggested to Congress at the last ses
sion, which failed in the crush of busi
ngs in the closing hours. To-night,
within half an hour after the Presi
dent's departure from Washington,
Secretary Taft. directly in charge of
canal matters, made public the per
sc-nnel of the new commission and the
division of duties among them. Only
one member of the old commission
was reappointed, Benjamin M. Harrod.
The personnel of the new commission
is as follows:
THEODORE P. SHONTS, chairman.
CHARLES E. MAGOON. Governor of
the Canal Zone.
JOHN F. WALLACE, chief engineer.
REAR ADMIRAL M. T. ENDICOTT,
U. S. N.
I'iADIER GENERAL PETER C.
HAIXS. V. S. A. (.retired).
COLONEL OSWALD M. ERNST,
ingineer, T\ S. A.
BENJAMIN M. HARROD.
With th- exception of Harrod the
comr; 'rÂ»m top to bottom.
There is considerable difference be
tween the functions and pay of the
nissioners. Finding he was
c/bliged legally to appoint seven Com
missioners, the President did so. but
-rried out hie "wr. plan by mak
ing thief of them practically the full
com rr The other four, though
le of Commissioners, not
only receive a much lower compensa
tion, but are assigned much smaller
field? of activity. The President has
it his scheme of divid
ing viÂ» tht work of canal building
.- tbe commissioners, so that
nominally acting as a body on stated
r. individual member will
â¢ in a special field.
DtFFBBBKCE IN SALARIES.
The head of the commission is a
trained railway man, chosen for his
administrative abilities in the financial
and purchasing field; the new Gover
nor of the Zone is a lawyer, who also
has had to do with state affairs; the
engineer-* "omr already is
known for his ability in the execution
practical work of canal-cutting.
The other members of the commission,
chosen to comply with the law as to
the number on the board, are men. of
hiph ability as hydraulic engineers,
tary Taft told them to-day that
:h*y were expected to show results,
and that ie said to be the keynote of
resident's action of to-day.
The President has made an order al
lowing an annual salary of $7500, with
travf-ling expenses, to each member of
Mfcm, and to the chairman
of the commission the additional com
pensation at $22,500; to the chief en
gineer the additional compensation of
ai.d to the Governor of the Zone
the additional compensation of $10,000.
The head of each department is al
lowed the use of a furnished house cm
-â¢,hmus and his traveling expenses
when traveling on the business of the
commission.
The total is $102,500. The salaries and
allowances under the former commis
amounted to $120,000. The total
compensation of the Governor of the
Zone and Chief Engineer are each un
changed.
Professor William H. Burr and Wil
liam Barclay Parsons, civil engineers,
will be appointed members of the con
sulting board of engineers.
TO HAVE ADVISORY BOARD.
In an order bearing on canal matters
issued to-day the President says:
There . will hereafter be appointed by thÂ«
President nine - civil engiofers of Uie : highest
â¢tending; having experience 'la wori of canal
construction and hydraulic*, to constitute a
board of consulting engineers, to which will
ba submitted by the Isthmian Canal Com
mission for its consideration and advice . the
Important engineering questions arising in thÂ»
selection of the best plan for the construction
of the canal. ThÂ« recommendation of the
board of consulting . engineers shall - be con
sidered by the Isthmian Canal Commission
and with the recommendations of the com
mission shall finally be submitted, through
the Secretary of War, to the President) for
his decision. ' . . â 
After their induction into office and
a consultation with Secretary Taft, the
commissioners met in the office of
Governor Magoon and had a brief talk
over the reorganization plan, but this
was necessarily of a premature na
ture because the new commissioners
are unfamiliar by personal experience
with the mechanism the old commis
sion has created. It is said that there
lis no disposition to make sudden
changes in it, though in the end a
more or less complete reorganization
is expected.
Under the President's order the ac
tual headquarters of the commission
will be in Panama and there probably
will be a considerable transfer of em
ployes from Washington to that place,
leaving here only a sufficient force to
carry on the work of the administra
tive branch and to keep the duplicate
accounts. Chairman v Shonts, with
Governor Magoon and Engineer Wal
lace, will spend most of his time in
the zone, but as the administrative of
ficers are directly in Shonts' charge,
he will be in Washington more or less.
The purchasing agent of the company
will probably be established In New
York.
WORK OF THE MILITARY.
Rear Admiral Endicott and Colonel
Ernst are charged with important
duties in connection with the navy
and army. The admiral is chief of
the Naval Bureau of Docks and Yards,
and Colonel Ernst is not only in charge
of important river and harbor works
in the neighborhood of Chicago, but
is president of the Mississippi River
Commission, and a member of the In
ternational Deep Waterway Commis
sion, which is to meet during the sum
mer at Toronto. Their continued
presence on the isthmus is not neces
sary and it probably will be quite suf
ficient if they are only there long
enough to attend the regular meetings
at Panama. This will enable Admiral
Endicott to meet the President's
wishes* and continue at the head of the
Bureau of Yards and Docks.
Colonel Ernst will be relieved of
the river and harbor work in the Chi
cago division by Colonel Wukkuan H.
Bixby, corps of engineers, now on sick
leave. Colonel Ernst will continue to
act as the president of the Mississippi
River Commission and member of the
International Deep-Waterway Com
mission.
Governor Magr>on will be required
to reside permanently on the isthmus,
and hai resigned his present position
as law Jffflcer of the Bureau of Insular
Affairs. It is the present intention to
refrain from filling the vacancy thus
created. The Insular Bureau, like the
other bureaus of the War Department,
will call on the Judge Advocate Gen
eral's office for any necessary legal
advice.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, APRIL 4, 1905.
WINE OF STATE
IS VINDICATED
The subject of wine adulteration was
the main topic at the meeting of the
Public Health Commission, held in the
rooms of the Board of Health. Andrea
Sbarboro, the wine merchant, who Is a
member of the commission, strongly
disapproved of the publicity given to
the adulteration stories, contending
that they were grossly exaggerated.
Sbarboro introduced a resolution con
demning the circulation of such re
ports as tending to injure one of the
most promising Industries. After long
discussion the resolution was with
drawn and a committee was appointed
to draft a substitute. The following
was finally adopted:
Whereas, It would appear that the policy of
ttn H.alth Commission in the analysis of
foods ar.d beverages has been misunderstood
ami that the erroneons impression has gone
torth that all California wines are adulterated;
therefore be it
â¢Resolved. That this commlnicn Intends to
take steps to assure, through our analysis and
lnspet-tun, wine purchasers at home and abroad
that California w!n*s purchased In San FYan
clsco vill be free from adulterants or Injurious
matter, and thus establish the claim of thÂ«
wine growers of the State that California wines
are thr purest sold in any market.
In vindication of the purity of Cali
fornia wines Dr. Gibbs. head of the
Pure Food Department, said in his re
port to the Board of Health: "Adul
terations in California wines nre far
from genera!. The sophistication is
mostly of local origin. In California
wines sold in the East no trace of
arsenic is found. Dr. W. B? Bige
low, Federal Chemist at Washington,
says that California wines are the
finest in the world."
The Board of Health held an execu
tive session at Dr. Ward's office yes
terday evening. It was decided to
push the work of food inspection.
Samples of beer are now being
analyzed by the department and some
startling revelations will be made
when the analyses are complete. The
subject of food inspection was taken
up at length. The board will publish
the result of every analysis made in
its monthly bulletin, without fear or
favor, declares Dr. Ward.
An additional chemist may be taken
into the Pure Food Department, as the
work now demands more help.

SACRAMENTO. April 3.â ln a
statement tt^day with reference to the
dismissal or Secretary J. H. Strine
from the Text Book Committee of the
State Board of Education State Super
intendent of Public Instruction T. J.
| Kirk said if any blame is to be at
tached to the incident he desires to
bear it all, as he took the initiitive.
The summary discharge of Strine,
who was formerly superintendent of
schools of Los Angeles County, has
j caused much comment and it is said
; the State Board of Education will con
! sider the matter at a meeting to be
' held in San Francisco April 12. Su
perintendent Kirk says the relations
between himself and Strine had grown
so strained he could no longer work
! with him. He declares this feeling
was largely brought about by the ac
tion of Secretary Strine and his par
ticular friends in getting the last
Legislature to pass a bill, without
Kirk's knowledge or consent, increas
ing Strine's salary from $1980 to $2500
a year. The money comes out of the
school book fund.
EXHIBITS MAKE
FINE DISPLAY
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SANTA CRUZ. April 3.â The exhibits
from the various college and city as
sociations provided by the Young Wo
men's Christian Association are in po
sition at the Hotel Capitola. They are
very âattractive and make the foyer
of the hotel during the students' con
ference a delightful and interesting
place.
Among the delegates at the Capitola
are several Hoopi Indians who are
members of the association at the Sher
man Indian School at Riverside. From
this school there is an exhibit of fine
needle work, the pillow-covers being
particularly pretty. Miss Lucy Wil
son of Chicago, a national secretary,
spoke of the students' work at a large
ly attended meeting to-night. The mv-
Bical feature this year is more elab
orate than ever before, special music
being rendered at all sessions. The
personal workers' classes inaugurated
by Miss Condeare a great success and
are largely attended.
Rev. F. L. Fraser, the retiring mod
erator, preached to-night at the meet
ing of the San Jose Presbytery. Dele
gates from all- the Presbyterian
churches in San Mateo, Santa Clara,
San Benito, Santa Cruz, Monterey and
San Luis Obispo counties attended the
meeting.
DELAY IN CASE
OF THE SMITHS
CINCINNATI. April 3.â The contest
by J. Morgan Smith and wife, relatives
of "Nan" Patterson, against extradi
tion and the fight against the New
York detectives will go hand in hand.
This was Indicated by the proceedings
in court to-day. Attorney Shay for the
defense asked for time to prepare an
answer. The court granted till Wednes
day, when the habeas corpus proceed
ings will be disposed of.
Shay was asked what he intended to
do about the letters of the Smiths that
were taken by the detectives and sent
to New York. He replied that action
would be taken against these officers.
When the habeas cduus case in be
half of Smith was calleuNvttorney Shay
alleged that the information or affidavit
upon which the Smiths were held in
Cincinnati was made out after the writ
of habeas corpus had been issued.
"If this is true the persons now in
custody are held illegally and ought to
be set free," said Judge Spiegel,
"I wish to procure witnesses to show
that this is true," said Attorney Shay,
"and therefore ask for a continuance."
"Your Honor," said Prosecuting At
torney Rulison, "we have all of the
papers necessary to hold these people
here with the exception of the copy ot
the indictment. We telegraphed to New
York on Saturday afternoon and re
ceived word that the copy was being
made with all haste and would be ex
pressed here immediately. This morn
ing by long-distance telephone we as
certained that the papers had been sent
and we have been trying all morning to
locate the money wagon of the Adams
Express, in which the package will be
found. The package arrived here this
morning, but so far has not been deliv
ered. We are ready to go on with the
habeas corpus proceedings, but ask for
a continuance in the matter of the ex
tradition."
The court then continued the case,
remanding the prisoners to the County
Jail in the' charge of the Sheriff.
The nucleus of the defense's conten
tion is that the requisition papers were
not issued by Governor Herrick, but by
a clerk, and that the issue of papers of
extradition is an executive prerogative,
which cannot be delegated.
When the papers were issued Gov
ernor Herrick and his party were in
Texas. He had left with his executive
clerk a number of forms of extradition
papers signed In blank. It was one of
these blanks that was duly filled out
for the return of the Smiths to New
York.

ance that the employes would profit
equally with himself by remaining to
complete the contract.

PEABODY SUED
BY C. H. MOYER
DENVER, April 3.â Charles H. Mur
phy, as attorney for Charles H. Moyer,
president of the Western Federation

the United States court against James
H. Peabody, former Governor of Colo
rado; Sherman M. Bell, former adju
tant general, and Captain Bulkeley M.
Bells (now adjutant general), who was
military commander in Telluride while
that city was under martial law, charg
ing that Moyer was subjected to hard
ships, humiliations and disgrace by the
defendants without probable cause and
also without legal process. He was also
deprived, the complaint feads, of hav
ing a public and speedy trial by an
impartial jury in the district in which
the offense is alleged to have been com
mitted.
The confinement, it is alleged, greatly
impaired the plaintiff's health by rea
son of the extreme dampness and un
wholesomeness of the jail. The com
plaint-aSEPrts that the defendants were
guilty of malice and that they should
be Imprisoned according to law.
Moyer was held as a military pris
oner. Damages In the sum of $100,000
are demanded from each of the defend
ants.

! Mrs. M. E. McCarthy, died suddenly of
| heart disease to-day at the home of her

law.
Things fairly sizzled around Judge
SÂ«awÂ«H's court yesterday afternoon
during the hearing of the suit brought
by local cipar dealers to restrain the
poÂ»cp from blockading their places of
business on the ground that they har
bor d^-alTs in pools on horse races.
It was not long before the argument
lost the dignity of a proceeding in a
court of equity, and developed into a
row between counsel.
District Attorney Byington. repre
senting himself and the police in the
Injunction cases, called Attorney A. S.
Newburgh of counsel for the cigar
dealers a "laughing hyena." New
burgh was nearly overcome with in
dignation, but between gasps .he
roared that Byington was a "dirty
flog." Then the charges came in such
bewildering succession that the Judge
eat amazed until it occurred to him
that Nevliurgh was to blame, and he
ordered him to appear this morning to
show cause why he should not be pun
ished for contempt.
Xewburgh was astonished that By
inerton should not be included in the
citation, and, while profusely apolo
gizing for his undignified conduct, he
continued to protest that Byington was
th* aggressor and should be punished.
While making his protest Newburgh
nervously masticated a handful of
rubber bands he picked up from the
desk. Judge Beaweli said that he had
not heard Byington say anything im
proper, and as a result Newburgh
must face the orflrial wrath alone.
THK (JI'AKKKL BEGINS.
Attorney H. E. Michael, from the
of.cc of Oleorge D. Collins, who is as
nociated with Xewburgh, was ques
tioning Private Detective Paul Q.
Smith, who, it is believed, is employed
by the Grand Jury to get evidence
against violators of the poolselling or
dinance, when Newburgh leaned over
and, addressing Michael, paid: "Ask
him if he has ever investigated the
District Attorney's office, or if he is
Just â¢<â¢ plain spy for that office."
Byington overheard the remark
and requested the court to instruct op
posing counsel to keep their comments
within proper lines.

"Woll, I never consulted with a
iHUÃhin^ hyena like you," said Bying
ton. "and I never will."
"You're a dirty dog," shouted New
burph, who was boiling with rage.
Klerks and bailiff rapped for order
while Byington and Newburgh kept up
the fight. Finally Judge Se'awell took
a hand and informed Newburgh that
as he had forgotten to maintain prop
er decorum and had made uncalled for
remarks he must show causo why he
should not be punished for contempt.
"Hut the District Attorney started
it," said Newbursh. "He called me a
'laughing hyena' and I had to strike
back."
BYINGTON ESCAPES.
"I did not hear the District Attorney
make any remark, " said Judge Sea

allegations and also protested against

which the police are moving against
them.

OPEN WAR ON POOLROOMS.
Nine Arrests in (â rand .lury Raid on
Abrams' Resort.
The Grand Jury started its war on
the poolrooms in earnest yesterday.
Nine arrests were made at Zick
Abranis' resort and nearly all the big
poolrooms suspended business.
Information of the Grand Jury's in
tentions had reached the poolrooms in
some manner, otherwise wholesale ar
rests would have been made. Fore
man Andrews is greatly disappointed
over the small number of arrests.
Places that were running full blast
last week were deserted yesterday. One
resort, the M. and M., where eighty
five persons were seen last Saturday
supposed to be buying pools, went out
of business entirely. When a posse,
in charge of H. J. Cordes and John H.
Speck of the Grand Jury and Under
Sheriff Hynes, arrived in front of it.
the furniture was being moved into
the street. Grand Jury detectives will
trace it and any effort to re-establish
the illegal business in another quarter
will be forestalled.
The raid on Abrams' place was in
charge of Secretary W. V. Bryan and
Deputy Sheriff J. J. Donovan. A posse
of deputies from the Sheriff's office
accompanied them. Here, too. the
gamblers seemed to have had a "tip."
The place was deserted. .
Bryan gave up the attempt and left
Donovan. Later the Deputy Sheriff
returned with his posse and dashed
into the cellar. Eight men and the
l>roprietor were arrested. Papers and
tickets with the names of hornee writ
ten upon them were also seized.
Following is tho list of arrests: Zick
Abrams, Samuel Harris, Daniel Cray
ton, Isidore L*Yy, E. Bradford, John
F. Jones, C. Lewis, David Thorp, L.
B. House, A. Haas and E. Prether.
They were taken to the City Prison.
There was some uncertainty as to
what charges should be made against
thrm. Finally it was decided to
f harge Abrama with running a pool
room and the others with visiting one.
one.
The ball for Abrams was fixed at $50
and for the others $10 apiece. The
money was promptly furnished by the
proprietor and all Were released.
Foreman Andrews declares that the
Grand Jury and the District Attorney's
office have in their possession complete
evidence to show that Abrams' place is
a notoriously open betting place. Mem
bers of the Grand Jury and detectives
employed by them have placed bets on
Oakland races in the place. Evidence
has also been gathered that the horses
ran on which the bets were laid. This
evidence was secured to prevent any
technicality from being raised to avoid
conviction. The proof is now ready
against eighty-seven po<jl-selling places.
Foreman Andrews is puzzled as to
how information of his intentions got
rut. He ordered Jurymen Bryan, Speck
and Cordes to meet him at the Califor
nia HotH with the posses. It is thought
that a "spotter" employed by the pool
room men was watering them and that
he gave the alarm.
1 am lather disappointed at the re
sult of the raids," said Foreman An
drews;. "Still, we have accomplished
one thingâ we have caused them to
suspend business. If they had not got
wind M uur movements we would have
made some wholesale at rests."
The Grand Jury is determined to car
ry the fight to a finish. They will take
up the suggestion of President Poheim
of ihe Police CommlÃÃion. Poheim de
clared that if it were shown the Co*n
misekiners that pools were being sbld
tkt any cigar store or saloon the board
would revoke the license of such resort.
The Crand Jury will at an early date
furnish evidence against a number of
places of this sort.
The raids yesterday were made un
der advice from District Attorney By
lnpton. Foreman Andrews did not con
sult with acting Chief Spillane. prefer
ring to use men from the Sheriff's of
fice.

The Sanitary Reduction Works will

Is Not Considered Serious
NO DETAILS GIVEN OUT
He Will Be Confined to His
Room for a Few Days, but
No Uneasiness Is Felt
LONDON, April 3. â The Prince of
Wales 'underwent an operation to-day
at Marlborough House. The nature of
the operation was not divulged in the
official statement subsequently issued.
The public was assured that nothing
serious was the matter by Sir Francis
H. Laking and Sir Frederick Treves,
the court physicians, whose signatures
are appended to the statement as fol
lows:
"Owing to a slight operation this
morning the Prince will be confined
to his room for a few days. As his
condition gives rise to no uneasiness,
no bulletins will be issued."
As further evidence that nothing
alarming is the matter with the
Prince, he yesterday attended church
and visited an artist's private studio.

has been appointed Embassador to
Italy, and Mrs. White lunched with

rival firm Portland. He was placed
in jail by Marshal George Slmonds

injuries are of a terrible nature, and
there is little or no chance for his re
covery.
SELECTS SITE
FOR TERMINUS
Special Dispatch to ThÂ« Oil
VANCOUVER, B. C, April 3.â F. W.
Morse, general manager o-f the Grand
Trunk Pacific Railway, the proposed
new transcontinental line, has just
made two important announcements.
The first is that the eastern terminus
on the Great Lakes will be located at
Fort William; and the second, that
work will be commenced immediately
on the building of what will eventually
be a branch terminus of the line on
the Pacific Coast.
Before leaving Vancouver for the
East a few days ago, Morse said that
he had purchased the charter of the
Kitamaat and Hazelton Railway, and
that work on the construction of the
line will be commenced just as soon
as the surveys are completed. This
will be the first western link of the new
line. Kitamaat is on the Pacific sea
board, just north of the northern end
of Vancouver Island, and Hazelton is
130 miles inland.
The selection of the eastern terminus
was made after considerable negotiat
ing had been done. Finally the city of
Fort William, which is at the western
end of Lake Superior and one of the
headquarters cities of the Canadian
Pacific line, agreed to give a bonus of
$500,000 for the terminus and secured it.
There is at the present time a rail
way system some 2000 miles in length,
between Winnipeg and Edmonton,
known as the Canada Northern. The
line is owned and operated by Mc-
Kenzie and Mann, two pioneer railway
builders. They intend Ur push their
line through to the Pacific Coast,
through the northern part of British
Columbia, just a 6 soon as the Grand
Trunk Pacific announces its route.
The two lines probably will reach the
Pacific Coast Rt about the same time
and there doubtless will be an inter
esting struggle for possession of the
territory and commercial advantages in
the north.

LOCAL SINGER
ENGAGED FOR
MAY FESTIVAL
VOCALIST WHO HAS BEEN EN
GAGED AS SOLOIST FOR THE
MAY FESTIVAL..
Mrs Snider-Johnson
Is to Take
Part.
Mrs. L. Snider-Johnpon, one of San
Francisco's best known singers, was
engaged yesterday as soloist for the
coming May festivals. This comes as a
surprise, as it was expected that all the
singers would be brought from the
East. But Director F. N. Innes wrote
Dr. H. J. Stewart, leader of the chorus,
that he had heard of Mcp. Snider-John
son's abilities and that he would like to
present her in the festivals. The re
quest was made that Dr. Stewart try to
arrange the matter. Mrs. Snider-John
son was willing and an agreement was
reached yesterday. Bhe will be prom
inent In the production on Thursday
night. May 4, of Mendelssohn's "Hymn
of Praise," in which there is a good
part for her. One delightful number is
a duet by first and second sopranos,
and as she has a fine mezzo voice she
and Mrs. Partridge, the Innes solo
soprano, will give a treat in this par
ticular part. Mrs. Snider-Johnson has
been on the professional stage, but
recently has devoted her time to choral
and choir work bf-cause of poor health.
The "Hymn of Praise" is Mendelssohn's
greatest work. It has never been given
here in festival form, but the rendition
of it this time will acquaint the muÃic
lovers with one of the most sublime
compositions of this master. The over
ture Is especially fine.
Mfiyor Schmitz yesterday consented
to deliver the inaugural address the
night the festivals open, April 30.

KNIFE FIGHT
ENDS A DANCE
BAKERSFIELD, April 3. â Word
reached this city to-day of a serious
fight with knives at Glenvllle after a
masquerade ball held there last night.
A quarrel between B. Fine and W.
Fugitt arose after the ball broke up
and Fine, drawing a knife, savagely
attacked Fugitt. Before friends could
separate the two men Fugitt had been
severely slashed on the body and
arms. He was carried to his home

Slimmer Death Rate Among
Infants Will Show Decline
NEW YORK. April 3.â Three trunk
lines are reported by the Commissioner
! of Health to have agreed that they will
I bring all their milk to New York this
1 summer in refrigerator cars, with every
can and case packed in ice. The small
er railroad lines are expected to follow
the same plan. An inevitable result,
the health officers say. will be mate
rial reduction" in sickness among in
fants and consequently a lower death
rate.
There will be no rise in the price of
milk in consequence of the purer sup
ply. The expense incident to cooling
the milk en route to the city is small,
not more than 1 or 2 cents for each
forty-quart can. Elaborate plans are
being made by the department to pro
tect consumers during the coming
warm season against an impure or
drugged product. Milk found to have
been treated with formaldehyde is to
lie seized and destroyed. Even three
drops of formaldehyde in a forty-quart
can of milk will be sufficient to cause
condemnation.
PLACED ON TRIAL FOR
ALLEGED EMBEZZLEMENT
Head of a Defunct Savin;* Society of

DENVER. April 3.â The trial of E.
M. Johnson, president of the defunct
Fidelity Savings Association of Den
ver, on a charge of embezzlement ctf
$11,000 of the association's funds was
begun in the Criminal Court hore to
day. Other indirtments. in which G.
W. Campbell, secretary of the com
pany, and M. J. and H. J. Johnson are
charged with grand larceny and em
bezzlement, will be taken ur> at the
conclusion of the case on trinl.
There are a number of indictments
against President Johnson and the
other officers, in which thfÂ»y are
charged with falsifying books and ac
counts. These cases ar*> based on the
building and loan association law of
1897, which a plea in abatement al
leges is unconstitutional, and the ques
tion will be passed on at the present
term of court.
The Fidelity Association is in the
hands of receivers and its depositors,
numbering many hundreds, have re
ceived nothing on their claim* since
its doors were closed about a year

HEAVY SHOWERS
DAMAGE FRUIT
NEWCASTLE, April 3.â No damage
by frost is reported from the Newcastle
orchards and no Injury except upon
the low-lying lands is noticeable. Even
the tomato plants and grape vines are
uninjured.
There will, however, be a shortage of
at least 25 per cent in the earlier esti
mates of the yield. This is due to the
recent long continued rains, which de
stroyed the pollen and blighted the
blossoms. The loss will extend to
early and midsummer peaches and to
cherries, plums and prunes. Certain
kinds of pears, grapes, oranges and
olives seem to be unaffected.

ascend the pole, as all the large wires
were severed and aflame. Parks was
finally removed to a corner drug store.
His condition is regarded as serious.

ANDREW WHITE
HAS CLOSE CALL
Shower of Glass Falls Vpon
the Diplomat as He Is
Seated in Railway Train
JUST MISSES HIS HEAD
His Silk Hat Cut Nearly in
Two by Flying Piece as
Though by a Sharp Knife
NEW YORK. April 3.â Andrew D.
White, former president of Cornell Uni
versity and ex-Embassador to Ger
many, had a narow escape from death
while returning to this city from New
Haven. He was severely cut by glass
from a broken window, and only es
caped by the narrowest margin from
losing the top of his head. The silk
hat which he wore was cut across as if
by a knife scarcely more than one
eighth of an inch from the top of his
head.
White had a seat in a Pullman two
cars back from the engine. Near him
sat a woman and a child. The train
was running at a high rate of speed
near Rye when it passed a freight train
going in the opposite direction. Sud
denly there was *T crash, and a shower
of glass and bits of wood fell on White,
who had been reading. Hi? hands and
arms were severely cut, while a piece
of plate glass had cut his silk hat al
most in two. The former diplomat was,
dazed by the suddenness of the crash
and is still suffering from the shock.
The woman passenger sitting near by
was slightly hurt, and when the train
reached New York she was sent home
In a cab.
Examination of the car showed that
'something had hit th^ double window
opposite where White was seated. Glass
from that side apparently had been
i hurled across the car with such force
that the window beside the former dip
lomat was demolished. The train was
stopped, -but no cause for the accident
could be found, nor was there evidence
that anything had been thrown at the
train. Trainmen reached the conclu
sion that a car door on the passing
freight" train caused the trouble.

"The Science of Modern Business Building**
The science of salesmanship marks a new epoch of prog-

this wonderfully progressive age. The laws of success and
the eternal principles of truth are involved in it.
Prof. Sheldon's lecture on this important subject is said
to be one of the most interesting, as well as the most in-
structive, addresses of the day.
He has addressed commercial bodies in many of our
large cities, and the press comments are so favorable that ot'r
citizens may expect a splendid mental treat.
The Ad Club believes this to be an opportunity to ob-
tain some new ideas and practical suggestions that will in-
terest every merchant, manufacturer, salesman or any other
business man.
Mr. Henry Weinstock, President <>f Wdfistodsj Lubin

Mr. Weinstock needs no introduction to a San Francisco
audience. His talents as an orator are well and favorably
known. Not alone in commercial life has Mr. Weinstock
won success, but he is recognized as one of the foremost citi-

CHIEF JUSTICE
SUSTAINS HILL
Opinion Handed Down in
Case of Northern Securities
Company, Recently Decided
ADVERSE TO HAKRIMAN
Method of Distribution of
Stock . Declared to Have
Been the Best and Wisest
WASHINGTON April 3.â ln the Su
preme Court of the United States the
thief Justice to-day handed down the
opinion of the court in the case of
Harriroan vs. the Northern Securities
Company, the decision in which was
announced several weeks ago. The mo
tion for the immediate issuance of the
mandate was denied, the date tor is
suance being fixed for April 15. After
stating the case at length the Chief
Justice said:
"In the present case complainants
seek the return of property delivered
to the securities company, pursuant to
an executed contract of sale on the
ground of the illegality of that con
tract, but the record discloses no spe
cial considerations of equity, justice
or public policy which would justify
the courts in relaxing the rigor of the
rule which bars a recovery. The Cir
cuit Court decrees and the action of
the Attorney General of the United
States puts at rest any question that
the ratable distribution resolved on
was in violation of public policy.
"The purchase by fhe securities com
pany was on its own account and not
in trust, and cannot be disturbed. And
there is here no offer of the restoration
of the status quo if that were prac
ticable. Doubtless it became the duty
of the securities company to end a
situation that had been adjudged un
lawful and this could be effected by
sale and distribution in cash or by dis
tribution in kind and the latter method
was adopted and wisely adopted, as we
think, for the forced sale of several
hundred thousand shares of stock
would have manifestly involved disas
trous results.
"In fine, the title to these stocks has
intentionally been passed, the former
owners, or part of them, cannot re
claim the specific shares and must be
content with their ratable proportion
of the corporate assets."
VICTORY FOR SHIP OWNERS.
Xot Responsible for the Escape of
Immigrants.
WASHINGTON, April 3.â ln an
opinion by Justice Day the Supreme
Court of the United States to-day re
versed the opinion of the Circuit
Court of Appeals for the Ninth Cir
cuit in the case of Hackefeldt & Co.
vs. the United States. The case in
volves the construction of the law
holding ship owners responsible for
neglect to return immigrants when
requested to do so. In this case the
immigrants were Japanese who es
caped from a locked room on ship
board.
The Government took the position
that the statute requires the return of
rejected immigrants under all circum
stances and the Circuit Court of Ap
peals took that view. The Supreme
Court, however, took the view in to
day's opinion that ship owners are re
quired only to exej-cise due diligence
in such cases, and failed to hold the
ship owners responsible for the es
cape of the immigrants.
TARIFF AND PHILIPPINES.
Ruling Follows Lines of Fourteen
Diamond Rings Case.
WASHINGTON, April 3. â Justice
Holmes of the Supreme Court of the
United States to-day delivered the
opinion of that court in the case of
Henry W. Peabody & Co. and Warner,
Barnes & Co. vs. the United States in
opposition to the contentions of the
Government.
These suits were brought to recover
duties from the firms on merchandise
shipped by them from New York to
Manila between April 11, 1899, the
date when the ratifications of the
treaty with Spain were exchanged,
and October 25, 1901. The decision
followed the lines of the judgment of
the court in the fourteen diamond
rings case, in which it was held that
after the titles passed to the United
States there was nothing in the Phil
ippine insurrection of sufficient grav
ity to give the islands the character
of foreign countries within the mean
ing of the tariff act.

The department has Investigated th*> charges
made against Judge. Raymond and' has reached
the conclusion that there was nothing found or
proved warranting: his removal from office. In
view of this â  conclusion 'it is not deemed the
province of the department to enter Into a
criticism of hts conduct. Federal Judges in
the States hold office for life In order that they
may be free from the Influence of fear ' and
other Improper motives. Territorial Judges may
be removed- by the . President,' but, as nearly
as may be, also should be free from such In
fluence. This they cannot If their conduct
is to be subject to constant comment by legis
lative officers near the President It is but
just to add that the Judge's honesty and,im
partiality cannot lie seriously questioned and
that he has made an exceptional record for
good and rapid work, particularly- in the â¢ sup
pression of the liquor traffic, a thing obviously
injurious to the peace and welfare of the
people of the Indian Territory. â¢.' ;.'./\:

BIG PROFITS
MADE ON GAS
Sold in New York City at a
Dollar When the Company
Buys It at Forty Cents
: FINANCIAL METHODS
Capital Stock Increased and
the Money Thus Secured
Invested at a Low Eate
NEW YORK, April 3.â Nearly 5,000,
000,000 of the 13,000.000,000 feet of
gas supplied to consumers in New
York City by the Consolidated Gas
Company last year was purchased
from the New Amsterdam and other
gas companies at the rate of from 28
cents to 40 cents per 1000 cubic feet.
This fact was brought out to-day dur
ing the examination of Benjamin A.
Whitelay, assistant secretary of the
Consolidated Gas Company, before the
legislative committee which is inquir
ing into the lighting conditions !n thia
city. The Consolidated Gas Comuany
supplies gas to consumers at $1 per
1000 cubic feet.
Robert A. Carter, secretary of the
company, who followed Whitelay on
ihe stand, was asked to explain what
disposition had been made of the $20,-
COO.OOO which was realized when th-i
capital stock of the company was in
creased from $50,000,000 to $100,000,000.
He replied that it had been used for
'construction purposes." By referring
to a statement which had been pre
pared for the committee, however,
Hughes found that nearly $12,000,000 of
this sum had been invested In corpo
rate stock of the City of New York at
a low rate of interest, while the stock
holders were being paid interest on the
sum at the rate of 6 per cent. Carter
explained that this was done because
the company might need the money at
any time and wanted to have It avail
able. He did not know that it would
be wanted in three months or even in
six months, however.
"Meantime you are paying 6 per cent
on this $12,000,000 out of the prolits of
the company and charging up â¢ those
pa^ ments as part of the expenses of
gas making." said Hughes.
"Precisely," replied the witness
The examination of Henry M. Ed
wards, auditor of the New York Edi
son Company, developed the fact that
while the actual value of the properties
owned by the Edison company at tho
time of consolidation with the Consoli
dated Gas Company was approximate
ly $19,500,000. the company had out
standing stock and bond issues aggre
gating $64,000,000.

GOLDEN TROUT
FROM WHITNEY
Rare Fish Are Displayed
at Exhibition of the Forest
and Game Association
ICE IS KEPT IX TANK
Scots Will Enjoy the Show
This Evening and Give
Dances to Bagpipe Music
Golden trout from an icy stream 7000
feet up the wild sides of Mount Whit
ney w r ere one of the new attractions
of the Forest, Fish and Game Associa
tion's show at the Pavilion last night.
As the story of how the trout had been
captured and the knowledge of what a
rarity they are got out among the
throng a dense crowd gathered around
their tank.
The flan were caught in Whitney
Creek by R. W. Requa, foreman of the
Sissons hatchery. With two assistants
he started up *the towering mountain.
One of his companions turned back
when a blinding snowstorm came on,
but the other two proceeded. Requa
got about three dozen of the trout,
which were brought down in a bucÃet
of water and ice. Plenty of ice was
kept in the tank in which the nsh were
shipped here, and a large chunk of it
floats in the water in which they live at
the Pavilion.
Theodore Kytka defeated Captain
Riley of the United States army in a
contest at the pistol range, and the Oc
cidentals beat the Olympics 20 to 8 at
indoor baseball.
Another acquisition to the exhibition
is the brown bear belonging to the Uni
versity of California. It was brought to
the Pavilion in a hack.
To-night will be given over to the
Scots, and hundreds of them will be
there. The following lads and lassies in
Highland costume will" portray the na
tive dances in unison: Madge Hamil
ton, Frances Dougherty. Meda Thorn
ton, May Foley, Nellie Macpherson.
Montague Barton, Kenneth MacÃae,
Jamie Newton Rae, Martha Bowes,
Margaret Grant, Marie Grant, Bertie
Campbell, James Trevethlch. Dolly
Ross, Maggie Ross, Anita Foley and
Alice Foley. Special Highland flings
and sword dances will also be given by
Lizzie Ferguson and Virginia Schultz
to the music of the bagpipes, played by
I. S. R. Tivendale and Adam Ross.

as Cars Go by Spot Where
Obstructions Were Piled
ALBANY, Or.. April 3.â Two at
tempts were made here during the
night to wreck the Southern Pacific
southbound overland train from Port
land. A freight train, northbound,
was derailed by a pile of ties on the
track one mile north of the city. Later
a second pile of ties was found on the
track one-third of a mile farther north.
All the obstructions were placed so as
to wreck the train coming south.
The obstructions were removed and
as the overland passed several shots
were fired at the engineer. To-day
shotgun shells were found on the
tracks. This is the second attempt to
wreck the overland in two weeks.
Officers and detectives are at work
on various clews. Several men known
to have been in the neighborhood of
the attempted wreck are under sus
picion. The company this afternoon
posted an offer of $500 reward for
information leading to the arrest of
the men who perpetrated the outrage.
THREE HONORED
SHEEP DROWNED
Special DlEXiatch to The Call.
REDDING. April 3.â The storm in
Southern Shasta County a few days
ago caused the loss of 300 head of
sheep, the property of George Phillips,
who lives on Elder Creek.
When the storm arose the sheep
sought shelter in a dry creek bottom.
The animals could not be driven out by
the herders and when the water poured
into the dry course they were drowned.
Many of them were washed down the
stream into the Sacramento River, a
distance of several miles. The water
rose very high and some of the sheep
were found next morning lodged in the
tops of the willow bushes along the
banks of the creek. If the sheep could
have been driven out they would have
been saved, but they were fear-crazed
and could not be persuaded to budge.

I HI. MAYORS MESSAGE
To the Honorable City Council of the Clt>^
of Oaklandâ^Gentlemen : Custom has *stao
lisht-d as a duty upon the incoming Mayor to
present to J"ou in a formal way a general out- |
line of policy and purpose' that shall shape |
the administration far as the executive Is
coiicerned. In pursuance of that duty 1 ap
pear here to-night and submit my first official
mefasase-
The people of the city of Oakland have re
posed in us a rreat trust by placing In our
hanÂ£s the control -of the municipal govern
ment fur two years. During this term we
shall be called upon to meet many questions
involving the expenditure of public money and
to dispose of many matters of great import
ance. In the solution of these problems we
ehould be guided by the single desire to pro
mote the public welfare and In ail things to
exercis* wisdom, caution, fairness and honesty.
Looking about our city-to-day we must feel
proud of her progress. Oakland ' has forged
ahead with giant Ftrides of late years and
has attained an important place in the State.
One need not observe very closely to note the
almost marvelous increase In substantial Im
provements.
We have recently witnessed the ' construction
of an additional ferry system and the great
development and business activity caused by
its operation, especially in that section of
the city which it traverses. Another trans
continental railroad has located lv termlnut
In our midst and it will not be long. 1 hope,
before still another great transportation com
pany will be laying it* tracks along our
eouthern boundary. Large manufacturing
plants have beer, established upon our watei
front, giving employment to hundred* of oui
citizens. Modern buildings are making their
appearance In our business districts, and In
every residential center of the city hundreds
cf homes, from the modest cottage to the
mannlon of luxury, are being constructed at
a rate never before approached in the city's
history. Oakland has taken on a new aspect
and to those of Mr who have spent our llveÂ»
here the new life Is manifest on ail sides.
There is a new atmosphere in our business
community and it is already realized that
cur commercial advantages are second to no
city In California. Now this mean* that Oak
land deserves consideration on lines that hayÂ«
not heretofore been deemed essential.
DAY OF BIG THINGS AT HAND.
In dealing with this newer Oakland we
must keep in mind that it is a city in every
â¢ense of the word. The day of small thing*
has parsed and we are now on a broadei
basis. It i* therefore necessary that the city
Itself should show that it possesses a truÂ»
progressive spirit and that it Intends to de
vote a proper portion of Its revenues toward
furthering public improvements and better
ments.

MAYOR KRAXK K. MOTT OF OAKLAND, WHO WAS INAUGURATED AS THK
CHIEF OF THE MUNICIPAL ADMINISTRATION LAST NIGHT. THE NEW
KXEI-TTIVB DEX.IVKRKD A VKRY OPTIMISTIC ADDRESS.
Well paved thoroughfares are as much a neces
sity as they are an attractive feature In the
appearance of a city. For sanitary as well
as eetht-tlc reasons thÂ« streets should he kept
'â lean ?rd the gutters clear of refuse and
foul od' n.
It lias become an Imperative duty to remedy
exisltlng defects in our principal thorough
fares and to improve our entire street system
in accordance with the demands of business
and the spirit of progress. ' I'D do this it will
be necessary to devote a 'larger share of pub
lic funds to the Street â¢ Department than It
has heretofore > received, and that a greater
degree of official . attention be devoted to the
question of etreet betterment. I shall exert
myself to. the utmost in behalf of this de
partment of our municipal life, and I am
confident of â  thÂ« cordial co-operation of the
Council and 'my colleagues In the - Board of
Public Works in this endeavor. If plans' for
street improvement on an extended scale are
to be successful, all the departments' of the
municipal government must unite with hearty
good v H'.. and give their best thought and
energies to a work which all will agree is
both necessary and desirable.
, MUST IMPROVE THE STREETS.
It will bo the province of the Council to
set aside as large a proportion of the rev
enues as can be spared from other n^tessary
purposes to the betterment of the public high
ways. an<* t<> co-operate with the Board of
Public Works in measures calculated to place
the streets In a condition worthy of this city
and Its inhabitants. Oakland should not be
content to hay* passably good streets or stn-f-ti"
only a triflf better than the streets of some
other city of equal Importance, but should
strive to hay* the best and cleanest streets
of any city in the country.
ThÂ«- majority of our residence streets are
construct^] ot macadam, with gutters of
broken stone and cut*bÂ« of wood. Advanced
municipalities are discarding the wooden curbs
for these of concrete and broken Â«ton<Â» gutters
are b^ing supplanted by gutters of cement.
While the original cost of cement and concrete
Is a little greater than the cost of wood and
stone, its durability more than compensates
for the first and largest investment. Gutters
of cement would materially decrease the cost
of gutter cleaning, on which nearly $20,000
annually Is now spent by the city, and I
would recommend to you the adoption of an
ordinance providing for gutters and curbs of
the more durable materials. Many of our
streets in that older portion of the city lying
contiguous to nur water front' were originally
of macadm. The lwÂ»l traffic to which thiso
are now subjected, however, warrants their re
construction of come material more durable,
either bitumen, vitrified brick or ba*alt block.
Improper refilling of the excavations made
in Ftrrets is one of the most potent causes
of street deterioration, and while it would he
Impracticable to wholly prevent the tearing up
of our roadways by sewer contractors and
those corporations furnishing public necssltles.
stili I believe the Â»vtl could be reduced to a
minimum by having the Street Department
refill all excavations In the most careful man
ner and charging the coat of the work to the
person, firm or corporation making the ex
cavation. I would recommend the passage at
once of an ordinance providing for the city
to do this work.
HEALTH CONDITIONS GOOD.
No branch of civic government Is of more
Importance, to the health ot Its citizens than
sa.nl aition. and In thi? regard Oakland Is well
provided for. The mortality reports Issued by
the Health Board demonstrates this, and ths
assertion Is made without fear of contradic
tion that Oakland stands to-day the healthiest
of all Pacific Coast dtle;-.
The growth of municipalities require* that
every effort shall be made not only for the
improvement of the streets of the same, but
for the protection of the lives and property of
Its inhabitants. The large demand for elec
tric light and power, and for telegraph and
telephone Â»ervlpÂ« has increased the number of
â wires stretched over the public streets, par
ticularly In the business sections, and follow
ing in the path of other large citUs In this
Stat* the time has arrived when municipalities
should tak<: notice of the existence of such
wires and secure their being placed under
ground wherever the public convenience and
necessity would demand.
Realizing that by virtue of franchise* grant
ed and to meet the rrowth of the city the com
panies had erected poles and wires as being a
means of supplying thÂ« mnt economic ' ser
vice. it is due to ', them that they â be - given a
reasonable opportunity to ' place their j wires
under ground. - I believe that thÂ« â  necessity
now exists in the city of - Oakland \ for such
service In the congested { thoroughfares within
the business center, i and I therefore recommend
that measures be taken to call Into conference
the " representatives of thÂ« -. companies having
overhead . wires to Jevise equitable ways and
means for the removal of the same within the
district mentioned, and that a sufflclnt period
of time, be given for such change commensurate
with , the large amount of work necessary in
that connection. ~^9KMBmMMBK::,r ' -
â \Vhil<Â» I am of the opinion that the clty
sbculd eventually own and control all sub"w*ys
for wir?s for all purposes, it Is perhaps too
early at the present time, to suggest such a
possibility It mut bÂ« borne In mind In this
connection that the city's wires for fire alarm
and police purposes traverse streets within the
urrltcry mentioned and that we should pro

in securing thi? necessary sen-ice.
WATER FRONT AND HARBOR.
I BUggept that you request the special at
torneyb engageu by the city in the water front
litigation to submit at an early date a full
report shotfTnjr the present legal statue of the
city In relation to Its water front, and also
with reference to the opening of the streets.
If we have acquired any rights from mjch liti
gation we ehould proceed to avaJl ourselves of
the benefits accruing therefrom. The proper
control and development of our harbor facili
ties i 6i 6 one of the great responsibilities resting
upon us. It is needless to enlarge upon the
enormous Increase of our commerce that will
r>-*ult under a wise and progressive policy In
connection with our administration ot this fea
ture of the city's resources.
Even under the unfavorable conditions that
have prevailed in the past the Increase has
been large, and yet It is not near as much as
it should be. It is imperative for the general
good of the city that our harbor and water
front property should be more generously
dealt with ao that it may be put in an in
viting position to all who seek sites upon
which to erect manufacturing establishments.
1 commend this question to your very serious
and early consideration.
Gentlemen of the city Council, the people of
Oakland expect much from this administra
tion. They have the right to demand much
from us. and I feel assured they will not bÂ»
disappointed. We hold the trust and confi
dence of our fellow citizens. It behooves us
to conduct our official business in such a way
that we Fhall not forfeit that trust and con
fidence. The keynote of ruccese in our under
takings Ip harmony. There should be a spirit
of co-operation. We should meet each other
r-n a common ground for the public good. It
shall be my purpose to be in close contact
with all departments of the city and to give
at all times my best thought and attention
to municipal affalrn. I am sure that every
member of this Council and every other official
and employe of the city government will be
equally concerned In this work.
In closing, I can only repeat the word "har
mony." We shall stand or fall on that prop
osition. But there can be no danger of falling 1
if we shall bear in mind always that we ars
here to further the city's Interests and not
our own in all that comes before us in any ca
pacity to which we may have been called D y
the people to act. And I hops that as we
meet with the various duties of the adminis
tration we shall neither shirk nor selfishly Ig
nore them. With a firm determination to do
that which appeals to our reason and con
pcience as right, we shall not be led far
astray.
Believing, as I do, flrmly In the material
and social advantages of the city we have
to guide, I approach the task with the keen
desire to give such return to our citizens that
when our two years of service have be^n
passed we can look upon the record and fwl
that something has been done for the better
ment of Oakland and that our labors shall not
have been in vain.

WITH STEALING
Keeper of Fashionable Board

Town Arrested for Theft
PASSION FOR "POSIES"
Neighbors With Denuded
Gardens File Formal Com
plaint Against Woman
BERKELEY, April Â».â The ambition
of Mrs. E. Robison of 2218 Dana street
to reap where she had not sown in her
neighbors' flower gardens has led to
her arrest and the placing of two lar
ceny charges against her. She was
detected in the act of helping herself
to the choicest flowers in Mrs. Martin
James* garden at 2623 Charming way
yesterday, and this morning appeared
in' Justice Edgar's court to answer
to the charge of theft.
Mrs. Robison is the proprietor of the
Colonial, a fashionable boarding-ho-use
at 2218 Dana street. Mrs. James is a
neighbor of hers, who has suffered the
loss of choice plants and flowers at va
rious times and who recently com
plained to the police of the depreda
tions. Others in the vicinity have made
similar complaints. Professor Hil
gard's home place at 222S Bancroft
way was denuded of many of its finest
plants and flowers a few months ago,
| and like complaints have been made
; by Mrs. John Hart of 2219 Dana street,
Captain Taylor of Oxrord street and
j others. In each ca?e the thief evinced
| a knowledge of what is finest in horti
! cultural specimens. Only the choicest
l flowers and plants were stolen.
Mrs. James procured the services
yesterday of Deputy Marshal Farrar,
who watched the grounds from dawn
until 1 o'clock, catching Mrs. Robison
in the act of stealing flowers. He pre
ferred the charge against her. She
deposited cash bail in the sum of $20
at the County Jail in Oakland. A sec
ond charge of s ; ~>ilar character was
immediately preferred against her by
Mrs. James and her bail was then in
creased to $100, which was given. She
is to be arraigned before Justice Edgar
to-morrow morning.
MOTHER'S LOVE
CAUSES DEATH
BERKELEY, April 3.â The dead
body of Mrs. Nellie Batterman was
found in her apartments at 2314 Char
ming way this morning by her house
keeper, Mrs. Lindsay. Death was
caused by asphyxiation A gas jet, in
a gas stove, fully opened, in the room
where Mrs. 13atterman slept had emit
ted during the night fumes that doubt
less caused the woman's death in a
very short time after she retired. There
were no indications that suicide had
been attempted, Mrs. Batterman being
in excellent health and spirits, her
financial affairs in excellent shape and
her home life happy. She was the
widow of T. S- Batterman. a wealthy
mining engineer, who died four years
ago.
Mrs. Batterman was botb blind and
without the ordinary sense of smell,
the result of years of illness. She would
not have known of her danger by any
of the ordinary means that reveal the
presence of deadly gas in a room.
- The theory of her friends is that be
cause of a constant fear Bhe entertain
ed of her children's asphyxiation from
the fumes of gas in a stove kept in the
house, she disarranged the mechanism
of the stove during the night while at
tempting to regulate it and thus
brought about her own death. She is
said to have had a morbid fear for her
children's saftey, constantly examining
the gas stove during the day to see that
it was properly regulated, so that her
little boy and girl might be in no dan
ger from the fumes.

Though Creeks Art still

Sportsmen Take to Beds
Special Dispatch to The Call.
HALFMOOX BAY, April 3j-Although
the streams are still high from the win
ter rains, the opening of the trout sea
son found many enthusiastic anglers
ready to test their skill with the rod.
Many fishermen have gone to La Hon
da to whip the streams in that vicinity,
and, although fishing will not be at its
best for a few weeks, interest In thr
sport is now keen.
There will be good fishing in a week
or ten days in the Alpine and La Honda
creeks, as all the streams of this coun
ty have been well guarded by the fish
and game commissioners this year.
Trout are plentiful, particularly at the
headquarters of San Francisquita. In
the Piscadero Lagoon large schools of
salmon have come in from the ocean
and excellent fishing is assured.
FAMOUS ACTOR
AS PROFESSOR
BERKELEY, April 3.â An announce
ment that aroused extraordinary Inter
est at the University of California was
made to-day, when information of
llans to secure the celebrated actor
and litterateur, Ben Greet, as professor
of dramatics at the State University
was given to the public.
President Benjamin Ide Wheeler has
given the project his sanction and full
approval, warmly seconding the efforts
of the university faculty committee on
music and dramatics in its plan to ar
range for Ben Greets entrance into
the faculty of the institution. President
Wheeler is an enthusiastic admirer of
the great Englishman's abilities and is
appreciative of the benefits that both
Greet and the university will receive
when the plan now under consideration
shall have been carried out and the
English actor and man of letters in
stalled as head of the new department
of dramatics.
Not until to-day did the plans of the
faculty committee become known.
Greet scored a great hit when he came
to the coast and produced for the first
time on these shores a dramatic spec
tacle which it was feared by some
could not be made to appeal to the pub
lic â his production of the morality play,
"Everyman." The success of "Every
man" was instantaneous and complete
at the university, and its tour of the
large cities then followed. Greet cher
ished the kindliest feelings for the uni
versity and was very grateful for the
support and co-operation he had here.
He credited much of his success to the
start "Everyman" received at the uni
versity, and later returned with elab
orate 'productions of "Twelfth Night"
and "Hamlet" in the ancient Eliza
bethan manner.
Greets laat appearance at the univer
sity was in an open-air production of
"As You Like It," under the historic
oaks on the campus. In this, as in all
other of his efforts here, he was emi
nently successful.
Greet staged Professor Charles Mills
Gayley's miracle play, "The Star of
Bethlehem," last winter at the univer
sity, this being the flrst production In
the West of the play. He became an in
timate friend of prominent faculty
members through these projects, joint
ly undertaken, and they are now deter
mined that if he will consent and the
way can be opened he shall become
their joint laborer in university affairs
These productions, as President
Wheeler explains, would have the same
relation to his lectures on the drama
that laboratory work has to lectures
by savants now at the university. The
chair of dramatics, when all the plans
for its founding are complete, will be
similar in its standing to the chair of
music, which latter now is particularly
engaging the attention of President
Wheeler, it being the president's task
to secure a suitable person to fill the
chair. President Wheeler said to-day
It Is desired to have a person of ability siml-
Uv to that of Professor Albert A. Stanley of
Michigan, who was of our summer school fac
ulty last year. It is difficult to oeoure such a
man. however, as the appropriation for the
chair Is for a period of two years only and
it is not easy -to persuade a first-class man to
relinquish a position for .>. tenure so short a
that which can be offered here. No one has as
yet been chosen for the place.

NO SENTIMENT
SHOWN IN WILL
OAKIiAND, April 3. â There was no
sentiment shown in the disposition of
the estates of the late Mrs. Elizabeth
Williams, or her husband, the late
Rev. Aaron Williams, each of whom
disinherited the other. When Wil
liams died last September he left an
estate of some $4000 to the Rev.
James Campbell "to spend for the
Lord." and left his wife nothing, say
ing that she was amply provided for.
To-day the will of Mrs. Williams
was filed for probate, the document
having been made but prior to her
husband's death and in it she be
queaths nothing to her husband,
as he has enough, and leaves
her estate, amounting to about $13,
141, to brothers and sisters and other
relatives. An actfiM was begun a
â¢short time ago by Mrs. Williams, by
which she was granted an allowance
of SSO a month from her husband's
estate, and" as it was somewhat in
volved it was thought the allowance
would nearly eat it up before it could
be distributed to the Rev. Mr. Camp
bell.

denced by the beam that accompanied
it and without the business idea of
putting in one more word for Cali
fornia's climate, it deserves to be
chronicled. The author of thÂ» beau
tiful "South Sea Idyls," that have
been read with delight in every part
of the world, set foot in San Fran
cisco again for the first time in ten
years at 6 o'clock last evening and he
says he hopes never again to make his
home elsewhere than in the Golden
State.
Mr. Stoddard is making his home
with his niece, Miss Ada Stoddard,
and his sister, Mrs. Parker Makee, at
616 Baker street. On his way to their
home he could not resist taking one
look into the Bohemian Club 'Just to
see who was there." The only two
members of the old guard In sight
were Uncle George Bromley and Gen
eral Lucius Foote, who were engaged
in & game of matador with dominoes.
There were a few minutes of affec
tionate greetings among the old time
friends and then the author hurried
back to the ladies.
"I look on my recovery from my
Illness of last year as marvelous,"
said Mr. Stoddard. "I am going to
spend at least a year in California
and then if my health is entirely good
and no other change is needed I will
remain here in San Francisco the rest
of my life. I regret that I was not
born in California. I think I was in
spirit Its Influence is always with
me.
"I shall remain here with my sis
ter and my niece for three or four
weeks and then will go to the south
ern part of the State to study the
missions. I wish to bring out con
cerning them that which other writ
ers seem to have overlooked, the ro
mance and poetry and legend that
hover about them. My book will also
do Justice to the Catholic side of their
history.
"I shall not go to Hawaii or the
South Sea Islands. They are still beau
tiful, but with the change in the na
tive there has passed the fascination
that they bore for me. There is no
longer a King in Hawaii. And Queen
Lil â she was one of the dearest friends
I ever had."
As he talked of the dreamy islands
that he has done as much as any per
son on earth to make famous, and of
the dusky queen who had been so dear
a friend, a look of tenderest memory
came over the kindly face of the
writer of books that are read, a sigh
escaped him and a tear glistened in
hi 6 eye. He was back among the in
genuous natives and the tropical
groves he had loved.
Mr. Stoddard will visit the Bohe
mian Club to-morrow and grasp the
hands that are waiting outstretched
there for the wanderer. He pro
nounced this visit "a delight that was
yet in store for him." He spoke of
his old literary friends and the good
times he expected to have with them.
"I can't go out and kill an Indian like
Joaquin Miller can," he said, "but my
heart is as light as ever, and I'll enjoy
meeting them all."
The author, besides his work on the
missions, is preparing to get together
for publication a number of his prom
inent sketches which will be published
in book form under the title of "The
Dream Lady," the principal one of the
collection.
Mr. Stoddard says the position Cali
fornia is taking in the world of letters
is amazing, considering the age and
population of the State, and he looks
for a wonderful literary future for it.
Dr. Woodworth of the Harvard facÂ».
ulty accompanied Mr. Stoddard to
California, and is also in San Fran
cisco. He is a son of Selim Wood
worth, one of this city's best-known
pioneers.
CHINESE BLOOD GOES
INTO THE BUREAU
President Roosevelt's Work Undone
by the Appointment of Herman
Jjow as Official Interpreter.
Herman Low, a Chinese of Ameri
can birth, was appointed yesterday as
Chinese Interpreter In the United
States Immigration Bureau. He is a
son-in-law of the well known Chinese
broker, Joseph Tape, and has been
connected in a clerical capacity with
the Hong Tai Company, which ship
ped a large number of actors, acro
bats and other show people to the
Chinese village at the St. Louis Ex
position. His father-in-law is a
wealthy expressman and is engaged
by the steamship and railroad com
panies to look after Chinese immi
grants in transit through the United
States. The position to which Mr.
Low has been appointed is not under
the civil service system. During the
administration of James R. Dunn as
head of the Chinese Bureau at this
port another Chinese relative of Jo
seph Tape took the civil service ex
amination and got to the top of the
list. Chief Dunn objected to the ap
pointment and stated that he did not
think it to be for the good of the ser
vice to have persons of Chinese blood
in the bureau. But the Civil Service
Commission appointed him in spite of
Dunn's protest. Dunn thereupon re
fused to assign the appointee to duty
and appealed to President Roosevelt
The President took Chief Dunn's side
and removed the mantle of civil ser
vice from the position of Chinese in
terpreter, whereupon Mr. Dunn ap
pointed Carlton Rickards, a Yankee,
to the position.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL. TUESDAY, APRIL 4. 1005.
WANTS THEATER
LAW MODIFIED
Supervisor Lunstedt Pleads
for Fair Treatment to Own
ers of Local Playhouses
WATER BILLS REDUCED
Spring Valley Company Con
tents Itself With Half of
Full Amount Demanded
The Board of Supervieors yesterday
considered a resolution introduced by
Lunstedt for the purpose of obtaining
a revision of tho theater ordinance, so
that a hardship may not be worked
upon the owners of playhouses. The
resolution was referred to the joint
Fire and Judiciary Committee and is as
follows:
Whereas, There Is a doubt existing in the
minds of a great many of San Francisco's
citizens as to the safety of its theaters; and
Whereas. The vested rights of tha owners
of said theaters have been seriously Jeopard
ised by the reports of the unsafe condition of
said theaters; therefore be It
Resolved, That the Fire and Judiciary Com
mittee of the Board of Supervisors be and are
hereby directed to revise such sections of the
building ordinances as apply to the construc
tion of theaters and that said committees be
further directed to consult with the City Ar
chitect and such other architects as they in
their Judgment deem necessary (o revise said
ordinances to the end that said theaters may
all be made safe to the public against tire and
panic.
Lunstedt spoke strongly in favor of
modifying the law. He says the public
has been unduly excited over the ques
tion of the danger from fire.
TJie ordinance authorizing the pay
ment to the Spring Valley Water Com
pany of $1166 66 monthly for water fur
nished to public buildings and $4166 66
monthly for hydrants during the first
eight months of the present fiscal year
was finally passed. The bills as filed
by the company for the service were
cut nearly 50 per cent in order to bring
them within the provisions of the one
twelfth act, the appropriations for the
purposes having been, respectively,
$15,000 and $50,000. The company's rep
resentative consented to the cut.
Grades were ordered changed on Lily
and Treat avenues and Emma street.
The Board of Works was authorized
to enter into a contract for the con
struction of a sewer in Mission street,
between Amazon street and Onondaga
avenue, at an estimated cost of $15,000.
A number of demands for returns of
rebate taxes paid under the special
lavy of 1902-3 were ordered paid on the
report of Auditor Baehr.
The roadway of Maple street, be
tween Clay and Washington, was ac
cepted.
The Board of Works was requested
to remedy the unsightly and unsani
tary condition of the receptacles for
street sweepings on Market street.
Bids were ordered invited for the
printing of the delinquent tax list.
Action on the recommendation of the
Fire Committee that the resolutions
granting permits to the American
Laundry Company to maintain an en
gine, boiler and oil storage tanks in
premises on Erie street, near Mission,
be indefinitely postponed, was deferred
one week to hear protests of property
owners.
The Invitation to attend the annual
State convention of Supervisors at San
Diego on May 9 was accepted, and a
committee was appointed to represent
the city at the convention.
The claims of Edward H. Smith and
Margaret Bannon against the city were
rejected.
VOTE TO MERGE
TWO BIG BANKS
The stockholders of the Nevada Na
tional Bank ratified, at a meeting held
yesterday, the proposition to amalga
mate with the Wells-Fargo & Co.
Bank. The stockholders of the last
mentioned institution having previous
ly taken favorable action, the vote of
yesterday, wheih was unanimous on
the part of the Nevada National Bank
stockholders present, makes the amal
gamation complete. The consolidated
banks will be known hereafter as the
Wells-Fargo Nevada National Bank of
San Francisco.
In addition to the consolidation and
in order to carry it out, the stockhold
ers of the Nevada National Bank voted
to increase their capital stock from
53,000,000, in 30,000 shares, to $6,000,000,
in 60,000 shares. They also voted to
transfer to Wells-Fargo & Co. 20,000
shares of the new stock on payment of
53,000,000 in gold coin and the transfer
by the Wells-Fargo & Co. Bank of its
good will, trade name and banking
business in the State of California to
the Nevada National Bank; to sell to
such persons as the directors may di
rect 10,000 shares of the increase of
capital for not leas than $200 a share;
and to increase the surplus of the Ne
vada National Bank from $1,500,000 to
$3,500,000 by adding $1,000,000 of thÂ©
$3,000,000 to be obtained by the sale of
20,000 shares to Wells-Fargo & Co. to
the present surplus of $1,500,000, and by
also adding $1,000,000 to be obtained by
the sale of 10,000 shares of increased
capital to the present surplus, thus
aggregating $3,500,000.
It was also voted to Increase the num
ber of directors from eleven to fifteen.
The board will include the present di
rectors of the Nevada National Bank
and four to be elected from among the
larger stockholders of the Wells-Fargo
& Co. Bank. Islas W. Hellman will be
president; L W. Hellman Jr. and John
F. Bigelow, vice presidents; F. L. Lip
man, cashier; George Grant, Walter
McGavin, Frank King and John E-
Miles, assistant cashiers. The banking
business will be removed for a time to
the present location of the Wells-Fargo
& Co. Bank. Changes will be made in
the present banking quarters of the
Nevada National Bank. When these
are completed the consolidated institu
tion will return to the Nevada block
permanently. Its capital will amount
to $9,500,000-
Boxers Ready for the Ring.
The boxers who are to meet in the
various matches before the Bay City
Athletic Club at Woodward's Pavilion
on Thursday evening have all report
ed In good shape and are ready to
give the fight fans a run for their
money in their respective bouts. Tom
Sullivan and Young Choylnski, who
meet in one of the main events, have
been working like professionals at
their training quarters and are right
on edge for the battle for the light
weight championship. The last time
these two clever boys met the sport
ing public was thoroughly satisfied
with the exhibition they put up and
as both are greatly improxed boxers
since that time their coming mill
should be even better than their last.
Tenny and Driscoll are also in
grand fix for their bantam champion
ship battle. These little fighting mar
vels have met four times, each win
ning two decisions. Driscoll won the
approval of the Judges after their last
bout and also the bantam honors.
BARRYMORE AS PUGILIST
HIGHLY AMUSING.
Realism Amounts to Genius
'The Other Girl"
Permits of No
Penance.
Plenty of Laughter
for Even the
Inexpert
Taking: in "The Other Girl" at the
Columbia this week can hardly be rec
ommended as a Lenten penance. In
fact, with Lionel Barrymore aa a dra
matized "Kid" McCoy â I am indebted
for the simile to that gifted pugilist,
Mr. Barney Bernard â the piece is im
penitently amusing. Further to say, if
you are no lady you will find it more
so. The masculine howls, when "Kid
McGarvic" had the "uppercut" of the
fun last night, were distinctly first. It
Is humbly recommended to the eternal
feminine that she take her husband to
the Columbia th's week. He will ex
plain why the other men hold their
ribs when tho "Kid," roused from sud
den sleep by a doorbell, thrusts an
agile "left" into the face of thÂ« audi
ence.
He will explain much ungodly- laugh
ter and not need to explain much
more. It does not, for instance, take
the sporting editor to laugh when the
prizefighter asks the preacher to "sup
pose they were putting up a fat purse
for the best preacher, say for the Au
stralian belt, would you be apt to be
putting 'em wise about your medals?"
In fact Mr. Thomas' latest is war
rant fOT laughter all through-, novel
and piquant in theme, original in plot,
and serving as a happy for
the excellent dozen of players that Mr.
Frohman sends with the piece.
The preacher and pugilist are the
chief characters, the pugilist the in
structor of the athletic preacher. In
cidentally the prize fighter has also
been instructing a foolish young wom
an from Philadelphia in the art of
love. She is a "society queen," and
the "Kid," his vanity tickled by his
conquest, persuades her to elope. How
she is rescued by "the other girl" is
excitingly and sufficiently convincing
ly told.
But it is the opportunity afforded to
this latest of the Barrymores as the
"Kid," that is the largest triumph of
the piece. The Barrymores can't help
acting, of course, but the realism of
Mr. Barrymore's pugilist amounts to
genius He shirks no whit of the outer
vulgarity of the fellow, his cheap van
ity, his ignorance; but he succeeds in
showing through these the genial, gen
erous, whole-souled, if somewhat theat
rical, characteristics in making the
"Kid" most thoroughly likable. HiÃ
make-up, his gestures, his facial ex
pression, are all gorgeously those of
the "ring," and the best portraiture of
its sort ever seen here.
The support is entirely admirable.
Richard Bennett as the clergyman is
capital. Miss Doris Keane as the young
lady from Philadelphia Is winaomely
reminiscent of Ethel Barrymore her
self. Grace Henderson also brings
manner, charm and a delightful nat
uralism to the part of Mrs. Waterman,
who chaperones the foolish Philadel
phian. Frank Burbeek as the father of
the girl is another capitally filled in
portrait, and Wallace Eddlnger as the
young woman's fiance is excellently ef
fective. Wait until the last, too, for
Miss Ella Ray's rayful moment as the
pugilist's "girl."
Miss Adelaide Prince as "The Other
Girl" is not wholly happy. Then to
the good again is Ralph Delmore as a
police Judge, and Maggie Fielding as a
red-haired, militant cook lady.
But you cannot miss it whoever you
are, going to see "The Other Girl."
BLANCHE PARTINGTON.
Central.
One of the prettiest plays, from
every view-point, ever produced at the
Central Theater was presented last
evening under the title of "Confessions
of a Wife." It has a good, clean,
moral, strong heart interest and a tu
multuous array of scenic effects, which
Include a snowbound train, a full-sized
steamship, patterned after a well
known local vessel; a bottomless ra
vine, the quaint blacksmith shop and
many other striking stage pictures.
Henrx Shumer is the particular star in
the bill, and divides honors with Juliet
Crosby and Herschel Mayall. Shumer
gave a clean-cut portraiture of the
village blacksmith and earned all of
his frequent encores. Juliet Crosby, as
the wife, was never seen to better ad
vantage. As the young lover Mayall
was good. George Nicholls gave a
jewel-like impersonation of the coun
try newspaper editor. Millar Bacon,
too, shared a. goodly amount of the
applause and, with Myrtle Vane, gave
an excellent performance. Webster
waa cast as the villain, and he and
Miss Ellaemere reveled In making
trouble for the lovers. They were fre
quently hissed. Miss Blanc gave a
good impersonation of the Irritable
aunt, and Baby Martine made a good
looking boy. The play bids well for a
big week at the Central.

comedians made great hits at both
performances at the Chutes yesterday
with their furiously funny farce,
"What Happened to Smithy." The
Mallory brothers, Brooks and Halli

Orpheum recently, met with a great
reception. The Berger brothers
proved clever comedy acrobats, Emile
Chevrial entertained with his trick
violin solos and Mabel Lamson was
warmly applauded for her illustrated
songs. The moving pictures, shown
by the animatoscope, were unusually
interesting. The feature of the ama

NOE VALLEY IMPROVEMENT
CLUB HOLDS BIG MEETING
Taxpayers of Mission District Want
Primary Department Restored In
James Lick School.
The Noe Valley Improvement Club
held a big meeting at Duvenick Hall,
corner of Twenty-fourth and Church
streets, last night.
It waa a representative gathering of
the taxpayers of that district. It was
the spirit of the meeting to hove the
conditions of the James Lick School
restored the same as they were on
January 1. At that time the small
school children In that neighborhood
attended the primary department in
the Lick School. This was convenient
for them. Since that time, howover,
the primary classes have been trans
ferred to the Noe Valley School. This
change, it is said, has worked a great
hardship upon both parents and pu
pils and they demand relief.
A. W. EllingTvood, a prominent citi
zen of that locality, will present a pe
tition signed by eighty property hold
ers to the School Board on Thursday,
begging them to change the primary
department back to its old location.
C. E. Myers, the president of the club,
was in the chair. The club will hold
its next meeting on April 17 at the
same place.

READY TO OPEN
WAR ON GRAFT
General Citizen Committee
to Be Named to Conduct
Crusade Against Looters
OUTLINE OF CAMPAIGN
Attitude of the Republican
City Organization Causes
Comment in Conferences
Leading Republicans of the city will
soon call for a general meeting of a
committee of 250 citizens to- formulate
plans for moving against the grafters
and looters of San Francisco. It can
be announced to a certainty that war
will be declared against Ruef and his
known allies in every Assembly dis
trict of the city.
The attitude of the present Republi
can County Committee is a topic that
has been fully discussed at every con- ;
ference of Republican leaders. The
committee embraces in its membership
many worthy men who are opposed to
Ruef's and Schmitz's methods of man
aging affairs of local government. It
is expected that committeemen who
are in sympathy with the taxpaying
citizens will cast the weight of their
Utftaenea against the intrenched forces
Of graft. As originally constituted the
Republican County Committee, select
â¢d by the convention which nominated
Henry J. Crocker for Mayor, was anti-
Ruef. During the progress of the
campaign an advisory body was added
to the committee and Ruef's hench
men thereby gained ascendency In the
governing body of the party. It is an
open question to-day whether the com- ;
mittee is for or against Ruef.
The forces of good citizenship, how
ever, can win out at the primary elec
tion with or without the support of
the County Committee. Delegates to
the convention proposed by the people
can be elected by the people. T^ie gen
eral committee of citizens proposes the
adoption of a system of nominating
delegates that will give the voters an
opportunity to elect men to the con
vention'who will represent the views:
of the merchants, mechanics and work- ,
ingmen of the various districts.
Under the law the County Committee
as the governing body of the party
must designate the time for holding the
nominating convention and also estab
lish the basis of representation. Tick
ets branded as "regular" may be pre
pared by the committee for each dis
trict, but it does not follow that such
tickets will mislead the men who are
leading the movement for better local
government.
A well-known Republican who car
ried his district against Ruef in the
last election remarked yesterday: "You
can lay any wager you want that Ruef
cannot bring about the nomination of
Schmitz by the Republican local con
vention. He does not expect the Re
publicans to nominate the Mayor, but
he hopes by manipulation to secure the
nomination of some man who will
agree to protect the appointees of
Schmitz. The Raef programme now
is the same in this respect as it was
two years ago. He calculates that
Schmitz will get the labor nomination
and is ready as usual ta walk out of
the Republican camp and work openly
for the labor nominee."

TUESDAY APRIL 4, 1905
THE CHICAGO CAMPAIGN.
THE city campaign in Chicago has been conducted on the issue
of municipal ownership and operation of the street railroads,
judge Dunne, the Democratic candidate, has taken a radical po
that question. The Republican candidate is more con
vative. His conservatism is caused by the condition of the city
ir.ee-. which. Mayor Harrison says, will not bear the burden of
â¢nicipal ownership, in view of the crying needs of the city for
er things and the debt and deficit now existing.
me of the supporters of Judge Dunne have urged that his ma
te made so large that it will scare the courts, not only the
. r. â¢" the Federal courts being included in the alarm. If the
.\nd purposes of Judge Dunne be lawful, if he proposes no
-ault upon property rights, it is hard to see why it should
wary to frighten the courts. If the movement, however, bo?
revolutionary lines its success may depend upon overawing the
lary. That being so. the campaign song should be:
"A fig for those by law protected ;
Liberty's a glorious feast .
Courts for cowards were erected.
Churches built to please the priest."
When it becomes necessary to effect a public policy by the co-
BrtS, â¢ is time to inquire into the nature of that policy
I take a foresight to see whither it is tending. The socialist doc
â¢ muricinal ownership and operation of street railways
ke them out of politics. It says: "A man once employed by
c employed for life.'" He is to be under civil service,
and is als< :ree from the whims of individuals." The profits
â c ownership are also to be large, and the sumptuous pro
gramme flitters with gain on all side?.
Municipal ownership in Great Britain is administered under all
c discipline and by civil service rules, to which that country
i long accustomed before it was introduced into the public service
the United States. Vet public ownership there proves that while
workman employed by cities engaged in municipal trading is free
m the whims of individuals, citizens and property owners are the
â¢es of his whims. In the city of Glasgow there are 15.000 work
tm employed on municipal plants. The testimony there and in
er cities of Great Britain is that such workmen are well organized
I influence municipal elections in favor of increasing their wages
beyond the market rate and for the extension of municipal own
-up into other fields, the money coming out of the taxpayers. The
ndon Daily News, commenting on the city election in Birming
ays that bands of corporation workmen were marshaled to
d plumped their vote. The effects of this in Birmingham
re *o keenly felt by the ratepayers that the town clerk said :
caking- purely of my own personal opinion, I should like to see
all corporation workmen disfranchised."
In London the street railroads on the south side of the Thames
ned and operated by the County Council. Before the Council
the roads they were very profitable. Sir John McDougal's
- hat under municipal ownership the cost of adminis
â¢ion has overtaken the profit. The workmen have banded to
her with outside organizations and so increased the cost of
at nothing is left, and the impetus of the policy that has
â¢ ed profit is such that a deficit must be faced, unless the fares
are raised.
In te city credit has suffered from the carnival of
nicipal ownership in which that city has indulged. Glasgow 3 1-2
have declined from 139 to 118, and her 2 1-2 per cent
have fallen from 103 to 86.
These results are traceable to the waste < iblic administration
and to putting the towns in control of the $ of the municipal
â¢rkmen.
In view of this experience in Great Britain, it seems at least
â Ã¼btful that the election of Judge Dunne and scaring the court-:
iheir judicial wits will bring the millennium to Chicago. Thai
em and administers it badly. The water is
â¢igerous to use that it was turned off at the public schools, and
the pupils were compelled by the Board of Education to bring
led water to school in bottles for drinking. It would seem under
h circumstances that Chicago would do well to wait before going
â j-.ilroad business until she has put money and energy into
ping the water supply, and into so administering it as to pre
,-â¢ -.hat are of constant occurrence.
The simple faith of the socialist i^ touching. It seems to be
hat cities by neglecting the proper duties of government be
come qualified to go into large and costly business enterprises. Chi
igo is not well paved nor is it kept clean. It has a poison water
:>plv. and is indifferently policed. Therefore, says the socialist,
run street railroads, even if the courts have
I in order to do it.
WILLIAM AND MULEY MOHAMMED.
THE Kaiser is on a pleasure trip in the Mediterranean, and
though on pleasure bent he has a frugal mind. Spain. Italy,
France and Great Britain, all of them interested in the Mediter
ranean through dominion of the COBBI or folamfa at that tidelesa S* .
entered mto an agreement, following the Franco- British treaty, that
France should have the job of keeping Muley Mohammed. Sultan of
Morocco, in the straight and narrow path. It was not known that
Germany objected to this, having no possessions there. But thr
Kaiser knows the art of keeping his neighbors m hot water, and dur-
p his yacht cruise has visited Muley Mohammed and put bad
- thoughts in his head. In effect. William refuses to consider the
arrangement made by the Mediterranean nations, and advises the
Sultan that he need not pay much attention to France. This is dis
quieting, and taken in connection with the Kaiser's intrusion into
Turkish affairs is little short of alarming.
The two Sultans are well skilled in playing the European Gov
ernments against each other, and will not wait long before beginning
the game. France is more impressed than Great Britain, because
there are indications that the Kaiser's course is indorsed at St.
Petersburg. In this there are great possibilities. Russia is balked
in ' Eastern Asia and must return to her former policy of forcing her
ty southward across the buffer states and to the Bosphorus. If
she cannot do this, she must have free passage through the Darda-
nelles for her Black Sea navy, which is now denied by the treaties
with Turkey. A Russo-German alliance would be strong enough
roe Turkey to abrogate the treaty and open the Dardanelles.
No wonder the diplomats have their thinking caps on, and all Eu
rope is on the gui vive. ,
The old story of an import duty on coffee has cropped up again in

materially benefit the Porto Rlcans and would also furnish the Government
with additional revenue. â Boston Herald.

LITTLE LANTERNS
OF THE SOUL
SIDNEY H. COLE
IN" the library of the villa the two
men faced each other. The little
red-shaded lamp dimly lighted the
big, luxurious room. Outside, the
last traces of the soft Italian twi
light were fading in the west, and the
first of the myriad stars were blinking,
uncertain yellow dots in the blue vel
vet sky.
>>i :.t senior lifted his piercing black
eyes and looked at his son searchingly.
"You're a common ne'er-do-well," he
burst out, "a gambler, a loafer, a rake.
You squander a fortune at the gaming
tables and come whining to me for
more money to lose. Get your money
where you lost it. I'm through with
you."
Young Orne drew himself up.
"Father " he began.
"I'm done with you," the older man
thundered. "I wash my hands of you.
As God is my judge. -I'll cut you oft*
without a cent. Go out into the world
and stand on your own feet â or sink
into the mire of ruin you've been delv
ing in. It's all one to me."
Young Orne strove silently to the
door, turned, hesitated, then hurried
through the hall into the soft night
without. The last streak of red was
gone from the west. Far below him at
the foot of the slope the little village
was agleam with lights. He noticed
that even in the trees tiny luminous
pinpoints of light shone steadily. Then
he remembered that it was St. John's
eve and that the lights were a part
of the fiesta.
He descended the steps and strode
across the terraces and through the
villa gardens. Ac he came to a group
of olive trees Just beyond the sundial,
he saw dimly a girlish figure standing
beneath one of the trees. There was
the rasp of a match; a tiny Chinese
lantern was lighted; and in its mel
low flow he saw plainly the girl's up
turned face as she reached up to fasten
the lantern to a low hanging branch.
It was Ethelyn Hope, the daughter of
his father's oldest friend, who had
made her home with the Ornes since
her parents' death. That was years
back, when Ethelyn was a little girl
in frocks. Now she was 18, tall, grace
ful and sweet alike in feature and in
temper.
Young Orne came into the little circle
of light cast by the lantern. There was
an old stone seat beneath that particu
lar olive tree, and he sank into it.
Celebrating?" he asked.
"Yes." she said pointing to the lan
tern. "It is a little lantern of the
soul."
â  A what?" he asked in laughing per
plexity.
"A little lantern of the soul," she re
peated. "You hang them on olive trees
and say little prayers for the souls they
represent. 1 heard Pietro and the cook
talking about them to-day. I made
them explain."
"I see." said he. "Whose soul is this .'"
and he pointed to the lantern.
"I haven't decided as yet," she said,
and added quickly, "I think it will be
yours."
"By all means let it be bo," he ac
quiesced. "Heaven knows I'm sadly in
need of pious prayers just now."
"Are you in trouble?" she asked.
"'Have you and Uncle Orne been quar
reling again?"
He smiled with ironic bitterness. "Oh,
there's been a slight tiff," he said eas
ily.
"That is bad," she said with ready
sympathy.
It ended byâ byâ well, to use bOM
words, by his kicking me out," said he.
Her face became serious. "He di 'it
really mean it, of course. He'll be ?â¢ y
before morning."
"I hope so," he said. "You can let me
know if he is, " he ended lightly.
'I let you know?" she said, frightened
by his tone. "You're not â not really go
ing?"
Ornes face darkened. All the rank
ling bitterness his father's words had
inspired was upon him again.
THE SUNNY SIDE OF LIFE
FACETJOUSXESS.
Ink Well â You seem to be full of
trouble.
Waste Basket- â Yes, and things look
kinder black for you, too.
THE VERY PLACE.
Katherine â I don't see any jewelry
store around here, and I want to get
a new second hand put on my watch.
Kidder â That's all right. There's a
second-hand store Just around the
corner.
'â¢Hold on. Sir Touchstone." said
his father.
-Â».
"I may be all he called me and more."
he said with an ominous calmness,
"but I stiil have some pride left. I
have to be shown the door but once."
The girl's hands trembled violently
as she leaned against the olive tree.
Orn<> with his head bowed sullenly, did
n<>t notice this. When he raised his eyes
she was still leaning against the tree.
He saw a strange, new light in her
eyes, and all at once he realized that
she was no longer a child, but a wom
an, and that her woman's heart was
his. The fact that there was love in
his own heart was as much of a shock
to him as the discovery of this an- 1
swering love in hers. He could have
cried out with the joy and pain of it.
He rose to his feet, pale and shaken.
"I must be going." he said roughly.
"Going?" she asked blankly. "Going
where?"
He laughed harshly. "I've all the
world to choose from," he said bitterly.
He <Trew her gently tn him. F.Â»r one
moment her head rested Ân his shoul
fi-r and her soft brown hair brushed his
cheek.
â¢ â¢ * â¢ *
Orne senior had long entertained an
idea. It was that some day hi? ion
would steady down and marry Ethelyn.
But being a wise old man and knowing
too well the dangers of match-making,
he said nothing of this either to his son
or his ward. Now as he sat in the ii- j
brary after the stormy interview with
his son he felt that hi? hopes had re- :
ceived their death blow. For a long ,
time he sat by the red-shaded lamp,
pondering deeply. Then he rose and !
went into the garden.
He walked rapidly up and down
the terraces for a time, his head bared
to the warm, light air. He saw the
light in the olive tree and wen^ down
the path to investigate. As he nearM
the tree, he caught the sound of a
woman's spasmodic .Â«obs. He slopped
and peered through the darkness.
What hÂ» shu beneath the olive tree
lifted a great weight from his heart,
and brought a grim smile to his lips.
"So. no." the girl was saying- wild- 1
ly. "I cannot let you go: it will break
my heart."
Hie son's voice answered sooth
ingly:
"It is best that I should go. dear. It

WOMEN POLICE WANTED
BY MATRONS OF NEW
YORK SOCIETY
There will be women police in this
city within the next few week?, if the
members of the Intermunicipal Com
mittee on Household Research have
their way, says the New York corre
spondent of the Philadelphia North
American. Police Commissioner Mc-
Adoo has been asked to appoint a suf
ficient number of female preservers of
the peace to cope with the refractory
girl servants who decline to accept a
discharge and, with skillet armed, defy
the world.
The society women behind the
household research movement declare
that their purpose is to protect the
servant and employer alike, and as
sert that a woman policeman can bet
ter accomplish the result than a rude
man who chews tobacco and knows
naught of diplomacy.
Mr. McAdoo hasn't quite reconciled
himself to the innovation, and fears
the women guardians of order whom
he might appoint would saHy forth in
the glory of blue jackets and blue
skirts, with brass buttons, helmets
and night-sticks.
He fears the complications that
might ensue should a mild-mannered
and highly refined policewoman be
called into a kitchen to eject a six
foot girl who was simply aching for a
scrap. To say the least, he is skepti
cal of the powers of persuasion under
the circumstances.
NOT GOOD ENOUGH.
Of course, Bill YVestunbej ry is a
good man; every man is a good man,
under our form of government, but
suppose we hadn't any better men
than Bill? asks the Atchison. Kan.,
Globe. What would the country
amount to? Bill is 4 4 years old and
he has never earned more than $1 50
a day in his life, and he couldn't hold
that job. He has never done any
thing for himself, for his country or
for his town. His wife supports him
with two cows and forty chickens,
: which gives him ample time to tell
. what other people should do. Really,
now. while Bill is a good man. suppose
we hadn't any better? What would
the country amount to?
REASONS I-OR LAUGHTER.
When the young mistress of the
house entered the kitchen she carried
herself with great dignity. .She had
come to call the cook to account.
Mary," she said, "I must insist that
you keep better hours, and that you
have less company in the kitchen at
night. Last night I was kept awake
because of the uproarious laugh'
one of your women friends."
"Vis, 'mum, I know," Mary replied

Orne senior, as he strode into the cir

glared at him savagely.
It seems," said Orne senior, with
Icy composure, "that you haven't madt
trouble enough, but must needs add
this Lothario business to your already
large repertoire of transgressions."
Young Oftne*s face went black. His
fists clenched; for a moment it looked
â¢ as if he would strike the older man.
Then with an effort he controlled
himself.
"Say what you like about my other
affairs, but kindly leave this to me."
he said In a voice hoarse with anger.
You're not worthy to worship the

"Hold on. Sir Touchstone." said his

Young Orne turned. "Well?" he

A rare smile curved the mouth of

TURNS DOWN
THE PETITION
Supreme Court Denies a Writ
Compelling Legislature to
Reinstate Former Senators
MAKES A FINAL APPEAL
Attorney Files Application
for Writ of Error to the
Federal Supreme Court
The Supreme Court yesterday morn
ing refused to interfere with the action
of the Senate in dismissing former
State Senators Frank French. Ell
Wright, E. J. Emmons and Harry
-Bunkers by denying them a writ of
mandate to compel the higher legisla
tive body to reinstate them. Two of
the petitioners, Frank French, stolid
and red-faced, and Eli Wright, nervous
and worried, appeared to hear the de
cision that blighted their hopes.
George D. Collins, acting for the com
bined counsel for the ex-Senators,
made an eloquent appeal in an almost
hopeless cause. He argued that his
clients were entitled to reinstatement,
as they had been dismissed by the Sen
ate without due notice and fair hear
ing. He denied that the former Sen
ators had been convicted, except by
that body, and that if the Senate had
arbitrary powers of dismissal those
powers conflicted with the fourteenth
amendment to the constitution of the
United States.
He maintained that although bribery
was a sufficient cause for dismissal, the
legislative body could not condemn
without hearing and that the Supreme
Court should compel the Senate to re
instate on those grounds. Chief Justice
Beatty said that he found no record of
any court having ever compelled a leg
islative body to reinstate a dismissed
member.
Collins argued that such arbitrary
action would raise the danger of a leg
islative body dismissing a representa
tive at ite pleasure and deprive his dis
trict of representation. He also said
that section 38 of the Penal Code ex
pressly states that only upon convic
tion can a legislator be removed.
Attorney General Webb, who was re
quested by the Senate to assume charge
of its defense, submitted a demurrer
containing three reasons why the cause
should be dismissed. First, that the
Supreme Court had no jurisdiction of
the person of the respondent, that it
had no jurisdiction over the subject of
the proceedings and that the complaint
does not contain sufficient facts to en
title the petitioners to the writ of man
date asked.
Webb made a technical point by say-
Ing that the thirty-six.th session was
named as defendant, and that as there
was no longer a thirty-sixth session the
writ could not be executed if issued.
He also said that every member elected
to the Legislature must take his chance
of being dismissed by a two-thirds vote
If the honor of that body demanded
such action.
Collins in his final appeal said that
some provision should be made for the
men to take their places if proved in
nocent of the charges against them.
After a short deliberation Chief Justice
Beatty announced that the writ was
unanimously denied.
Later in the day Attorney Colling in
behalf of the former Senators filed an
assignment of error, together with a
petition for a writ of error to the United
States Supreme Court. The Justices
took no action in the matter yesterday.

CASHING CHECK
Edna Clyde Josselyn, Male
Masquerader, Is the Cause
of William Gordon's Arrest
ESCOKTS HER TO COURT
R. Meyling, Another Friend
of the Young Woman, Sees
Him and Trouble Follows
William Gordon escorted Edna Clyde
Josselyn to Police Judge Fritz's court
yesterday, and as a result he is in the
City Prison charged with obtaining
money by false pretenses. Miss Jos
selyn was the young woman arrested
in Chinatown on Saturday night by
Sergeant Ross for masquerading in
male attire. Incidentally the charge
against her was dismissed.
R. H. Meyling, 319 Davis street, was
also interested in Miss Josselyn, and
visited the Hall of, Justice to see how
her case would terminate. He saw
Gordon and told Detective Reynolds
that he wanted Gordon arrested. He
explained to Reynolds that in Decem
ber last he gave Miss Josselyn a check
for $20 50 to pay her expenses at the
Hotel Meredith on Turk street, where
she informed him she preferred to live.
The check was drawn on the Central
Trust Company and he made it pay
able to the Hotel Meredith. Two days
later he decided he had T>een unwise to
issue a check and he called upon Miss
Josselyn, offering her the money in
return for the check. She told him
that she had lost it and he hurried to
the bank to stop payment. He was
too late, the paying teller informing
him that the check had been paid to a
young man who had indorsed it "Hotel
Meredith, by George F. Gordon." Mey
ling asserted that William Gordon was
the man who cashed the check.
Reynolds placed Gordon under ar
rest. He denied cashing the check at
the bank and said he had only been
in the city for two or three weeks. He
was corroborated by Miss Josselyn.
Meyling insisted that Gordon be taken
to the bank and the paying teller at
once identified him as the man who
had cashed the check. Gordon was
taken to the City Prison and booked
on the charge of obtaining money by
false pretenses. Meyling's theory is
that Miss Josselyn gave Gordon the
check to cash.
QUESTION SOUL
WINNERS' PLANS
Method of Some Evangelists
Who Labored in Oakland
Meets With Disapproval
Discussion as to the beneficial results
of the late evangelist meetings held in
Oakland under the guidance of Dr.
Wilbur Chapman took 'place before the
Congregational Ministers' Union yester
day morning.
There was divided opinion over the
methods adopted by some of the evan
gelists to gather in souls, not a few
taking issue with the plan of conquer
ing backsliders and others whose Chris
tianity was doubtful.
That the results were not eommen
suate with the effort put forth was
plainly the" opinion of some of the di
vines.
There were those who defended the
means used, and in this way the matter
became interesting. There were experts
on evangelism on both sides of the ar
gument.
Dr. C. R. Brown, pastor of the First
Congregational Church, Oakland, in
troduced the subject, and while he ad
mitted that the religious and the con
secrated turned out to aid in the work,
they were the people benefited. The
hundreds that rose in the big audiences
indicated that a very large majority
were already professed Christians.
He was fain to admit that there was
now more desire on the part of Chris
tian people to go out and work, and
that the experience they had fitted
them the better to labor in the good
cause.
He told of the methods peculiar to
some, not all. of the evangelists which
had come under criticism. It had been
concluded in certain quarters that some
of the evangelists had a tendency to
ward "professionalism"; they appeared
in the eyes of some as "mechanical."
Even some of the most ardent believers
in evangelical effort were unfavorably
impressed.
One speaker declared that if the
noted locaf pastors. Dr. E. R. Dllle, Dr.
C. R. Brown and Dr. E. E. Baker, had
conducted the services more people
would have been reached and con
verted.
TOO MUCH PRESSURE.
Dr. R. C. Brooks held that the
churches had been brought into strong
er fellowship and the spirituality of the
people had increased, yet he, too, spoke
of the method of too much "urging"
and "pressure," which had induced
criticism.
The method adopted by one of the
evangelists was especially condemned.
The speaker complained that the
gentleman in question would ask all
the young people to stand. When all
wr>re on their feet he asked all those
rendy to profess Christianity to sit
down. Th*>y would do so.
Then he would request those who
had "signed rards" to take their seats
and those who had expressed a desire
In any way to become Christians to
be seated.
The method, it was held, was con
sidered a sort of trap and a humiliat
ing position In which to place the au
dience.
Th*> Rev. H. F. Burgess of the Sec
ond Congregational Church. Wept
Oakland, thought the meetings had
resulted in good to the mechanics of
his neighborhood.
It is safe to say that in consequence
of the divided opinion as to methods
there will he some changes in the per
sonnel of the evangelist party expected
in San Francisco next November when
the revivals are looked for.
A FATHERLY JUDGE.
The Juvenile Court was the subject
of an exhaustive story by Dr. E. R.
Willis in the presence of the Methodist
preachers' meeting yesterday.
The doctor had attended Judge Mu
raÃky's inquiries Into youthful short
comings, and had been deeply im
pressed with the "fatherly" way the
Judge treated the erring children
brought into his presence. Dr. Willis
gave some alarming accounts of the
degradation that thrives in the hearts
of some of the most "gentle, sweet
fac&d" boys.
Dr. Francis Larkin attributed much
of the waywardness of children to the
SHOW CONTEMPT
FOR THE COURT
Two Husbands Who Trifled
With Alimony Orders Are
Committed to County Jail
GrKANNIS ONE OF THE3I
Member of Big Plumbing
Finn Fails to Escape Con
sequence of His Act
J. G Grannis, senior member of the
firm of J. G. Grannis & Co., plumbing
supplies, 565 Mission street, was com
mitted to jail by Judge Hebbard yes
terday morning for contempt of court.
Grannis refused to obey an order di
recting him to pay his wife, who is su
ing him for divorce, $100 a month.
Mrs. Grannis began her action for di
vorce early in 1903. She asked for ali- I
moiiy pending the determination of the
case, and the court awarded her $100 a
month. Grannis paid the sum regular
ly until December, 1904, when he de
cided that he had paid enough, and
quit. Since then Mrs. Grannis has made
several Ineffectual efforts to collect the
alimony, but without even partial suc
cess.
Yesterday morning â¢ when the case
came up Grannis' attorney sought to
placate Mrs. Grannis by offering her
$20. She scorned the offer, and then
the attorney made the proposition to
the court that Grannis, who he said
was in the building, be looked up and
given an opportunity to explain why he
could not give a* greater sum than $20
to his wife. Judge Hebbard said he
didn't want to hear any explanations, i
and ordered the bailiff to find Grannis
and take him into custody. Grannis i
was not to be found, however, and the
bailiff returned empty handed.
POTTKIt ALSO COMMITTED.
George H. Potter was also committed
to jail for contempt for refusing to pay
hie wife, Maud C. Potter, $30 a month
alimony pending a decision of her suit
for divorce. Judge Troutt made the or- !
der in Potter's case, and as soon as
found he will be taken to the County
Jail, there to remain in confinement un- â¢
til he meets the obligation imposed
upon him by the court.
Rosa Michel, young and pretty,
proved to Judge Kerrigan the fact that
when she married Isidor Michel in Den
ver late In 1903 she believed the cere- |
mony was simply one evidencing their
engagement. After the ceremony she
testified that she returned to her moth
er and was never informed by Michel
that she was his wife until one day
she went to him to break the "engage
ment" and he told her that she was al
ready his wife. Then she recalled that
at the time of the ceremony she was
not 18 years of age and that she had
not obtained her mother's consent to
wed, only to become engaged. The
young woman's mother testified to the
same facts. Judge Kerrigan said he
was satisfied that the young woman
had been misled, but before entering
his order he directed counsel to submit
copies of the laws of Colorado relating
to annulment of the marriage cere- ;
mony.
MICHEL MAKES PROTEST.
Michel, who is a machinist's helper
at the Union Iron works, was present
to make bitter protest against condi
tions as he found them. If his wife
wanted a divorce, he said, she should
be granted one. but the court should
compel her to return the $54 he spent
on her trousseau and the many $20
piece? he had given her mother. Judge
Kerrigan said he had nothing to do
with their financial affairs and Michel
reluctantly left the courtroom. In the
corridor he met the young woman to
whom he had been engaged and start
ed to speak to her. In thÂ« choicest
German she grilled -him for about five
minutes and when she ceased he looked
much relieved and said: "Well, she's
engaged to a better looking man that
makes more money than I do. I guess
she'd better have a divorce. She talks
too cross."
Lionel R. Hare, mining promoter,
has been made the defendant in a suit
for divorce filed Saturday by Daisy A.
Hare. Mcs. Hare charges her hus
band with cruelty, desertion and fail
ure to provide. She says they were
married in 1895 and that he abandoned
her in September of 1903. She claims
that one night during their residence
together he came home intoxicated and
ordered her to take off his shoes and
collar and put him to bed.
DRIVEN' FROM HOME.
Her refusal so angered him that he
drove her from the house, she claims,
and vented his wrath on the bric-a
brac and furniture. On various occa
sions, she avers, he seized her by the
hair and threw her down and when
this method of punishment became too
comrmrnplacp he would pinch her black
and blue. He also struck her once
with a rifle, she says, and threatened
her with a razor on various occasions.
She says he makes $l&0 a month and
she asks for permanent alimony.
Judge Graham yesterday set aside

trln In her suit against Henry H. Vau

TRYING A FAMILY ROW
Mexican Immigrants Place
Two Children in Orphan
Asylums and Go to Work
A special board of inquiry in the
United States Immigrant Office yester
day investigated the case of Soledad
Maldonado, aged 22 years; her daugh
ter, Rosario, aged 4 years; her brother,
Bias Suarez, aged 10 years, and her sis
ter, Antonia Reyes, aged 15 years.
The family arrived here from Mazat
lan on September 10, 1903, by the
steamship Colon and were admitted on
the representation of Felipe Suarez,
the brother of Soledad. They left his
home within a month after landing
and Mrs. Maldonado placed her daugh
ter Rosario In the Mount St. Joseph's
Orphan Asylum, and her brother Bias
In St. Vincent's Orphan Asylum. They
were arrested on October 17, 1903, for
deportation on the ground that they
had become public charges, but
through the intercession of the Mex
ican Consul and Mrs. Nieves Harris, a
wealthy Mexican woman who promised
to take care of them, they were per
mitted to remain. Two months after
Bhe took charge of them they left her.
the mother again placing her daughter
and brother in the orphan asylums
named. Brother Felipe complained to
the immigrant officials and the crowd
were arrested. The Bister, Antonia
Reyes, was found employed as a nurse
girl in the family of General Urioste,
Consul for the Argentine Republic.
The arrest was made at the instiga
tion of Mrs. Felipe Suarez, the wife of
Soledad Maldonado's brother.
Mrs. Suarez said yesterday:
ThlÂ» woman Soledad has been slandering
me to my husband until he has become dick.
H e is a machinist at the Risdon Iron Works
end he has worried so much about these
slanders told him by his sister that he is
unable to work and can't get well, and he
will be kept sick so \vng ac this woman Is
allowed to stay here. I made complaint
against her to have her deported to Mazatlan
and I have told the truth about her putting
the children into an orphan asylum.
Soledad has been earning her living
by doing needlework for Marks Broth
ers at 1220 Market street. The fore
man will testify before the board of in
quiry to-day that she is an industrious
woman. The inquiry will be resumed
this afternoon, until which time Sole
dad and Antonia were allo-wed to go
on their own recognizance.

AUGIE FINISHES FIRST
IN A VERY BREEZY DRIVE
PICKAWAY DEFEATS TOUPEE
Iredeus Disposes of
Neva Lee by a
Neck.
FRED E. MULHOLLAND
There was one finish at Oakland
racetrack yesterday that evoked any
amount of critirism, humorous and
otherwise. Half a dozen of the nine
starters in the mile and a sixteenth
gr fixture descended on the wire in
a group, like a handful of bricks fall
ing from a ten-story building.
Jack Little^which had been leading
seventy yards from the wire, was not
â¢placed In the money. Augie being
awarded first and Evea G. the favorite,
the second position. Then nine out of
every ten viewing the finish from an
angle were willing to wager the Judges
were wrong.
They made no allowance for the fact 1
that Jack Little was bearing out,
while Aupif and the first choice on the
rail were running straight and true.
To heighten the effect Otis, who
piloted Jaik Little, rode into the win
ners' circle on returning to the stand,
a timeworn trick, which earned a light
for the rider. The judges are
c only position to separate the
horses, and old timers at the game all 1
know that endeavoring to pick a finish
from an angU- is a precarious business. :
BR\(KhH> IT>R THRI.K CHOICES.
Superb weather for racing purposes
end a good card attracted a large
Monday crowd. Favorites were in
fair fettle. capturing three of the
â¢venus decided.
F\>r an even money chance, South
â  LAdy had little to spare at the
conclusion of the two-year-old
F- ramble. Knapp handled her to ex
cellent advantage, and in a driving
finish downed I'm Joe by less than a
n. Telepathy, backed from 50
down to 20 to 1, took show honors
from Yolo Girl.
It appeared as if overconfidence on
the part of Larsen might h*ve cost
Toupee, the favorite, the six-furlong
p puree. At the start Taylor
i out in the lead with Pickaway,
I shot. The latter has the
reputation of being a quitter, and at
the paddock it looked a Tar Flat ban- j
M Of peas that Toupee
would win. Larsen refrained from
drawing his whip on that account,
starting to do so. Taylor, it
â would appear, also had a reserve fund
and landed the outsider by half a
length. The miserably ridden Ocy
rohe ran third.
A -heap collection of platers started
in the mile and a furlong selling af
fair. Maxetta had first call at 7 to 5,
and Charity Bell placed the mare over
the plate first, a length ahead of I. O.
r. The show went to J. V. Kirby.
MU.imKD KSDUI IS SECOND.
Mildred Schulta demonstrated to the
faction of all, in the mile and
seventy-yard run. that a route is not
her long suit. Lloyd Fountain rode
the mare, and she closed a 9 to 10
favorite. She weakened perceptibly
as the wire was approached and
Flount registered first by half a
length. Big Beach ran a moderate
third.
Dr. Rowell's sprinter Iredeus
snatched the closing event in a neck
finish from Neva Lee. Travers rated
the big son of Golden Garter, which
was a 7 to 10 favorite, during the early
et of the running, then dropped
him down a neck before Neva Lee, in
a nerve destroying finish. Bozeman on
T"colaw grabbed the show.
TRACK NOTES.
Dick Dwyer made some excellent
. starts with the barrier.
Iredeus, never a sound horse, pulled
somewhat lame after his race.
The judges reinstated Jockey Hurry
â  Michaelf- . He was suspend
ed for what looked a careless piece
of riding on Collector Jessup.
Solomon Bonner, the colored rider.
was on Saturday last given twenty-
four hours by the stewards at Oak
land to report to the rta.ble of W. B.
Jennings. He fp.iled to do so and was
ruled off the turf yesterday.
Jere Dunn was dissatisfied over the
showing made by his filly. Ethel Bar-
rymore. and seemed inclined to crlt

WANTS MANY THINGS DONE
TO WALTER B. JENNINGS
The arrest of Walter B. Jennings
for fraud, and judgment against him
for the cancellation of a contract and
$50,000 damages is asked In a suit
filed against him yesterday by G. W.
Berry, as guardian of Solomon Bon
ner, a jockey. Berry alleges that
through fraud and misrepresentation
Jennings obtained a contract for Bon
ner's services as a jockey from his
father, the Rev. A. Bonner, who re
sides in South Carolina.
For young Bonner's failure to abide
by the terms of the alleged fraudulent
contract, Jennings, it is alleged, pur
poses having Bonner ruled off all of
the tracks of the country. He has al
ready greatly Interfered with the
young man, it is alleged, and will, un
less restrained by order of court, ir
reparably injure him in hie business.
So the court is asked to compel him
to surrender the alleged contract for
cancellation, that he be arrested for
his conduct, compelled to pay $50,000
damages and be perpetually restrained
from carrying out his threat to have
young Bonner ruled off the turf.
SUPERVISORS
DO NOT TAKE
UP QUESTION
Levy Has Nine Votes to
Seven for Collrotti in
the Board.
The deadlock in the Board of Super
visors over the boxing permit for April
remains unbroken. The matter did
not come up at the meeting of the
board yesterday, neither of the parties
striving for the valuable bit of paper
having sufficient votes to carry the
day.
It requires ten votes and while
Morris Levy of the Hayes Valley Club
could muster nine, Manager Jim Cof
froth could count only seven in his
favor, Supervisor Sanderson, upon
whom he counts, was not present.
There is a supposition that if Coffroth
can secure the vote of Supervisor Rea
that of Supervisor Hocks will be forth
coming, thus giving him the required
number. Coffroth is bringing tre
mendous pressure to bear on these
parties, while equally strong pressure
is being exerted on the other side. The
matter will be fought Â«ut at next Mon
day's meeting.
Battltes Nelson is out with an an
nouncement that he is ready to fight
Joe Gans, the lightweight champion,
or any lightweight in the world. Nel
son is taking good care of himself and
is apparently counting on fighting be
fore the Hayes Valley Club this month.
If Nelson and Gans fight on the same
night on which Britt and White are
to meet the $40,000 house upon which
the latter are counting will shrink to
small proportions.

YOUNG CORBETT
IN POOR FORM
PHILADELPHIA. April 3. â Youns
Corbett's fight against Young Erne at
Washington Sporting Club to-night was
the most deplorable exhibition made by
the former invincible Denverite in his
entire career. Not only was he "hog
fat," but he could barely get out of his
own way. Had Erne a little more
courage and had he used his speed he
could easily have carried off the hon
ors. As it was, he was so afraid of the
kid's "rep" that he did little else than
clinch and run away.
Willie Fitzgerald, Joe Gans, Al Her
ford and Kid Howard were in Corbett's
corner. The Denver boy weighed every
ounce of 140 pounds. Eddie Hanlon
challenged -Cne winner. The fight was
probably a draw. If Young Corbett
fights Hanlon in his present condition
it is a safe bet Hanlon will put him
out.
The first round was Erne's and the
second one likewise. In the third round
Corbett became real aggressive and
opened a cut over Erne's eye with a left
uppercut. During 1 the rest of the round
he had the Quaker on the run with his
fierce body smashes and won out on
the round. Erne boxed a little in the
fourth and the session was even. Both
clinched in the fifth. Corbett from
weariness. Erne from fear. At one
time they were locked for fully thirty
seconds before the referee could pry
them apart.
They woke up finally and were slug
ging so hard at the bell that neither
heard it, and they kept on fighting.
Corbett again had the round. In try
ing to get away from Corbett In the
last round Erne tumbled through the
ropes. When he climbed back Into the
ring he suddenly seemed to realize that
Corbett was. not so much and fought
back hard. They were slugging at the
bell and the round was even.
Petalnma Nine Defeated.
The Sullivan Stars defeated the
baseball club at Petaluma on Sunday
by a score of 4 to 0. It was a snappy
game from start to finish. Tom Me-
Gee of the Stars did much toward
winning the game by his clever field
work. Sam Dreyfus was also there
with two hom^ runs.
The rich man who is fond of telling
how he made his first thousand dol
lars is generally more reticent about
his last thousand.
COLLEGE CREWS
WILL GO NORTH
STANFORD UNIVERSITY. April 3.
Treasurer Barrett is determined to
give the Stanford crew plenty of op
portunities for action this spring, al
though the prospects of a race with
the University of California tm the
29th inst. appear poor. On the 15th
inst. Stanford will row the Waihing
ton Varsity over the Redwood City
course, which proved so acceptable last
Saturday at the Interclass regatta. The
crew will then probably be taken north
to Seattle." where they will again meet
the Washington crew.
At this time the Stanford freshmen
crew will be given an opportunity to
meet the Washington 'Babies." A
(fhree-cornered race is also being ar
ranged with the Portland Rowing Club
to be held at Portland in June. The
crack athletic clubmen are eager for
the race and it will be a big attrac
l lion during the fair.
Commencing to-morrow the varsity
and freshmen crews will row steadily
at Redwood City. The varsity crew
will probably be picked as follfws:
Captain W. E. Dole, 1905. stroke; Fred
Zimmerman, No. 3; B. Bryan. No. 2;
H. P. Butterfleld. bow. and E. V. Hen

CHICAGO, April 3.â The Western
Jockey Club at its regular monthly
meeting held here to-day granted sev
eral applications for reinstatement, re
adjusted racing dates for St. Louis
tracks and disposed of considerable

ers, who were ruled off during the sea
son of 1303. The following persons and
horses were restored to good standing:
Charles Smith, Jockey (suspended at Fort
Erie, 1904) ; J. W. Harshberger. Jockey (sus
pended at New Orleans. 1902) ; Walter StmÂ«,

EDITED BY
R. A. SMYTH
Jabez White, the English boxer
his first serious gymnasium work for
his light with Britt yesterday at Lark
spur. He took a long jaunt on the
road with Charley Mitchell in the
morning: and both returned with high
ly colored faces which had been touch
ed up by the ardent sun.
In the vernacular of the prize ring
White "strips big." He has good
shoulders and chest and the strongly
deflned muscles of his arms have un
doubtedly been brought out by hard
work. He has a round body which is
slightly reminiscent of George Dixon.
His legs are stout and shape'y. H â¢
is a tireless worker in the gymnasium,
going from one exercise to another
without a moment's pause.
He boxed four rounds yesterday
with Charley Mitchell's son who is a
mere novice at the game. It was im
possible to get a line on White's ability
with such an opponent, but he seemed
to have all the hooks, jabs, upper cuts
and natural ability to block usually
found in the repertoire of a good
American boxer. He seems to be able
to hit from any position and with
equal facility with either right or left.
He is, of course, far from being in
fighting condition, but there seems an
indefinable something lacking in his
make-up. It is possibly the youthful
freshness and suggestion of ruggednesa
which one finds in so marked a degree
In both Nelson and Britt.
White believes In plenty of work.
After his boxing he sparred around
with a light pair of dumbbells. He then
wrestled about with Jimmy Lawlor,
who is assisting In his training. He
skipped the rope for rive minutes and
then tossed the medicine ball for some
time. His breathing is labored at the
present time, but that is to be expect
ed, as he has barely settled down Into
the routine of training.
He labors at a disadvantage in being
only a pound or so above weight at the
present time. This gives him but little
material on which to wort.
Charley Mitchell is watching over him
with the greatest care and promises to
have him ready when the appointed
time comes for him to fight.

Nearly Capsizes

the Sea.
The Pacific Mail Company's Bteam
â¢nid Juan, Captain Urry, arrived
>-esterday morning from Panama and
way ports several days behind time.
Hr joy in reaching port at all the
passengers overlooked the coaster's
tardiness, which was caused partly by
bad weather and in a measure through
the disabling of her machinery. As a
: of this combination ail on board
led a great scare. The air pump
refused to work during the height of
one of the many storms through
"which the San Juan had to make her
The engines stopped and for six
hours the coaster wallowed helplessly
in the trough of a big sea. Waves
boarded the vessel from both sides
and at each end. Several times she
rolled^over so far that her ability to
recover her equilibrium seemed doubt
ful. The deck officers could do noth
ing until the engineers had patched
up the crippled machinery, and the
look>pf anriety on Captain Urry*s face
only added to the consternation of the
passengers. ' â 
The San Juan now in the twenty
fourth year of her career and she is
not so â  â¢-!; able as she once was to
cope with the opposition of the ele
ments. Continued head winds proved
a heavy handicap, and with the delay
caused by the breakdown the San Juan
new holds the record in recent years
for slow traveling from the isthmus.
The San Juan brought four cabin
passengers and twenty passengers in
the steerage. She had 891 tons of
cargo and treasure valued at $3572..

FEAR BIG DAM
WILL GIVE WAY
HIGHLAND. April 3.â The heavy
rains of lest winter have filled the
Great Bear Valley dam as it has not
been filled in many years and the old
fear that the big structure may give
way has been revived. The dam is so
situated that should it break the im
mense volume of water it restrains
would rush into the San Bernardino
Valley at the east end. The town of
Rediands would receive the full fxTee
of the flood. San Bernardino and Col
ton also would be In the track of the
waters.
Many citizens are of the opinion that
the dam is perfectly safe, but they be
lieve there is danger of an earthquake
separating the bonds in the big dam.
Several grand juries have Investi
gated the dam in the past and experi
enced engineers have looked it over
and pronounced it sound, but for many
years there has been a feeling that it
is Insecure. Engineers have condemned
the alleged faulty construction of the
masonry, but nevertheless it has stood
for about twenty years.

The family of the late Isldor Rosenzweig
gratefully acknowledge the kind expression of
sympathy shewn them by their many friends.
"You don't say 'down with the
J trusts!' any more," said the friend.
"No," answered the apprehensive
citizen. "It doesn't seem to have any
, practical effect and I'm afraid some
trust might hear me and retaliate by
casually remarking 'up with prices.' "

Good Outlook for Lnmbcr.
P'acifi" Coast "Wood and Iron for April say*: j
. '"Although the actual lumber bnf!nÂ«se was j
owing to the inclement w*-Â«.:her rather quiet,
Â©Ci*>rÂ» for farure delivery, both for spruce an'i
T(K!wo<yl, cine In handsomely and th<*re 1Â«
hardly a redwood mill that is n-Â« stocked with
or.JerÂ« That will take at ess two months to
CJI. The shipment of twenty- five oars o f red
wood to the Bast by th* Hammond Lumber
Company is but the b^glnnSng of a series of
shipments that will follow and soon a regular
lunibw train will be in constant motion from
tbcj Pacific to the Atlantic. Redwood millmen
have -Â»rak*n*d to the fact that comÂ« care must
be tai*n in preparing their lumber for the
" Eastern trade, aad their efforts are being
recfrzn'.zei and appreciated, as is shown In the.
Incrtwing ovders.
"Tbe Washington and Orcpon lumber still
cosiea in lar?<Â» quantities and yards are
filing up.
â¢"Shing!ei! are In great demand and orders
are in advene* of capacity. As *oors as pleas
act -wtather sets in there will be a dearth of
shsngjes Ties are scarce and will be for
tons? tlrse.
"On the whole the spring opens with every
prorpect for a great year for the entire lumber
trac> on Uie coast. **

concentrated in a imw stock" while the mass
of securities in that department were flvggish
ana almost in oil. In the Industrial depart
ment there was manifest a spirit of adventure
which wandered freely through the list, p!ci
tnsj tret subjects herÂ» and there for wide and
â¢rudaeci iaoveiaÂ»fata. The first animation in the
railroad lit*, was awakened 1?y renewed con
slieratlcn of the tcr!c of the Nortbern --CUTI-
UÂ«6 case. Tie report was circulated early la
tbÂ« day that the ded-: SB in this case "-.-'a 10
be boslrd down on the reasstcmbling of the
court at noca after the spring recesti. Union
Pacific sprang into prominence, as had been
the cjuw whenevor this subject is actively

renewed assumption That me final disposition
cf tals case was '"- event awaited for the
putting- into force locs rumored projects of a
Vnlon PadSc and New Tcrk Central combina
tion. In to-day's trarkrt large buying of. the
Erie itocks was executed in rach a way us 10
f.vr the appearance of cotslsg from the same j
frmrcez RÂ» thÂ« Union Pacific and New York
Central trcying.
The effect was a leap to the conclusion that :
the Erie was to be included in thÂ« supposed j
ccanbinatica. The first report Iron the Su- 1
l'T^irtt Court after noon indicated a stay, I
tv-hkh might lavclr* a' farther indefinite de- |
iay .-.ni prrices in â group had a sharp set- '
bark.
In the industrial departin'nt much was made
In a g-enwal way of the high, degree of activity

j- CHICAGO. April 3.â Official ; forecast of â 
I freezing temperature In Kansas and Nebraska j
strengthened the. wheat, to-day. At the close '
July wheat was up I -4t?%c. .1 ' J
At the start weakness characterized tradiaf \
In the wheat pit. Prices at Liverpool were "CS I
j Vid lower, chiefly because world's shipments !
I were larger than expected,; and : because of a .
i let-up lit European spot demand. The for- '
i tlgn market was partly Influenced by continued
1 favorable crop conditions in the American
I\k heat belt. Another factor that worked well
1 in the hands of local bears was the report of I
large receipts of wheat at Minneapolis and j
j Duluth. arrivals to-day at the two points be- '
I Ing 50Â» cars, against 398 cars the correspond- 1 !
! ing day in '190*. - Prediction ; had been made
that the llrst receipts in April. would show a
' material decrease from those of a year. ago.
I Influenced by the large shipments at thes?
I two grain centers lnngr* offered to sell quits
I liberally both here and at the > Northwestern
{ markets. ' The principal bearish factor, how
ever, was continued fine growing. weather in
the West and Southwest. Sentiment changed
suddenly on an official prediction of colder
weather" throughout the West with - freezing
[ temperature In Kansas and Nebraska.
I Active covering by shorts caased a quick ad- â¢
rancad, July selling to 88% c. Some damage
reports telegraphed from Western- Kansas
belped to encourage buyers. _ The market held â¢
I tirna the remainder of the session. July clos- |
ing at 87V' ;V - . Â .
i Considering the number of bearish Influences
i that affertedÂ»the situation a comparatively firm
: tone prevailed In the corn market. Early in â¢
! th* day the market was " rather weak, in- |
i fluenced by a material Increase In world's '
i shipments and by liberal local receipts. Weak- I
! m-o.* >f wheat also had a : depressing effect. !
Shorts covered freely on predictions, of colder )
j weather, and the market soon became firm.
i July crÂ«?;ned %i to nt/ '4e lower, at 47c to j
1 47#47Hc, sold up to 47*4C47Uc, , and closed â¢
1 at 47^ic. . .. . .- ": â  . I
Trading in oats was fairly active. Follow- j
ing an easy opening due to. weakness of other '
' grain*, the market showed considerable flrm
] ness. Elevator interests and shorts were the i
â¢ best buyers. July ' opened a shade to *â â¢%Â£ â¢
I lower at 20U'to 29% c, sola up to 29%e, and |
I closed at 2Â»%Â©29 . j
More, interest was manifested in provisions
â¢ than has been in evidence for some time past,
i On active support from packers they became
decidedly strong after an easier opening . re- j
sulting from a decline in the price of live hogs. 1

est mines in this already famous mining camp is due princi-
pally to its. location. It stretches directly in the path of Tono-
pah Nevada, Midway, Golden Anchor, Jim Butler and Mon-
: tana ; consequently' the ledges from all of these run right
through the Tonopah Home district. '
Another good reason is that the geological formation is
-such that work can be easily facilitated and progress more

We are in receipt of a communication from J. If.
Skelton, Secretary of the Tonopah Home Mining Company,
.yesterday, which reads as follows:
"A 25: foot of $171 or*, 200 feet north of the shaft in the' 'â¢
Golden Anchor, has' been struck. This is : very beneficial to the
Tonopah Home. This ore is on the 730-foot level, and proves
> the ledges, of the Mount Oddie system, a distance of over 4600.
"} feet, meaning, of course, that this is one of the Montana Tonopah
ledges." - :- " Â»- : " WSE&
There is now a movement- on foot to form a company
which , will be" called the â¢ Tonopah Home Consolidated j
'* Mines and Exploration Company. So it is up to you to get"

HENDERSON OUT
ON PROBATION
Tliujz Who Turned State's
Evideuce Put on Good Be
hnvior for Next Two Years
CRIBS LIKE AX INFANT
Must Make a Report Every
Wivknt Least Three Times
to Detective Ed J. Wren
William Henderson, who turned
Stale's evidence against his fellow
Thugs charged with the murder of Po
liceman Eugene C. Robinson, at Six
teenth and Valencia streets, on Jan
uary 21, 18.02. was allowed to go on
probation for two years by Judge
Cook yesterday. Detective Ed J.
Wren was made probationary officer,
and Henderson was ' ordered not to
leave the State and to report to Wren
at least three times each week. While
the Judge, was making the order Hen
derson burst into tears and sobbed like
a child. He was- taken away by friends
ho were in court in anticipation of
the Judge's action.
When the case was called Attor
ney O'Connor, who represented Hen
derson, said that in view of the serv
ices that Henderson had rendered the
State in testifying against his co-de
fendants it had been suggested to the
District Attorney and accepted by him
that Henderson should be allowed to
go on probation.
The Judge said it was a proper case
for such procedure. The people of the
Statf had been benefited by the testi
mony of the defendant in all the other
cases, and it was apparent that with
out his testimony there would have â¢
been a complete failure of justice.
.whereas, by his testimony, the people
of the State were enabled to proceed
against all of the defendants engaged
in this crime. â 
After reciting the result of the trials
of Woods, Kauffmann, Coulter. Ken
nedy and Goucher the Judge said that
in view of all the services rendered by
the defendant it was eminently proper
that some consideration be shown him,
and if not shown him the people never
would be able to avail themselves of
that kind of testimony.
" The Judge then made an order that
â¢ the charge of assault to murder
against Henderson for shooting at De
tective Taylor on the night of the
â  Robinson murder be dropped from
* the calendar, with the consent of the
District Attorney, which was followed
by the probationary order on the
charge of manslaughter, to which
Henderson had pleaded guilty.
The case of Frank Woods is still on
appeal before the Supreme Court, and
in the event of Woods being grant ! a
new trial it is desirable to have Hen- i
derson here to testify. Woods was >
convicted of murder in the first de
gree and sentenced to be hanged.
Alan Goucher, convicted of murder
in the second degree, will not be sen
tenced till to-morrow morning.

CONVICT MAKES
SCENE IN COURT
Ernest Moore Chadwick Ve
hemently Demands Speedy
Trial on Forgery Charge
OBJECTS TO ATTORNEY
Says He AVill Conduct His
Own Case and Takes an Ex
ception to a Continuance
Ernest Moore Chadwick (alias "Sir"
Harry Westwood Cooper) made one of
his characteristic displays in Judge
Cook's court yesterday when the case
was called charging him with tele
graphing a forged message purporting
to be from another person. Just prior
to his marriage to Norine Schneider
in February, 1901, Chadwick showed
the girl telegrams purporting to
have been sent him by her
mother consenting to their mar
riage. He was tried and convicted o-n
the charge in Judge Lawior's court,
but fa appeal was taken to the Su
preme Court and he was granted a new
trial, the case being assigned to Judge
Cook's court.
Chadwick was convicted of perjury
for falsely testifying at the trial in
Judge Lawlor's court and last week
Judge Cook sentenced him to serve
ten years in San Qucntin. At the time
the Judge thought that the other
charge should not be pressed if the
defendant did not take an appeal to the
Supreme Court.
Yesterday when the rase was called
to bo set for trial Assistant District
Attorney Ashe asked for a continu
ance aau caadwick protested vigorous
ly. "I demand," he said, "a speedy
trial. The District Attorney at the
last ralhi.R of the case answered
ready, and now he asks for a continu
ant, t. I have been in jail now tor over
four years waiting a final decision in
this case, and I demand a speedy con
clusion."
The Judge remarked that he had bet
ter wait till his attorney, whu was
engaged at a trial in another court,
was able to be present.
"I am quite able to conduct the case
myself." sjiid Chadwick, "and do net
want the assistance of my attorney.
I am ready to go to trial now and in
sist upon no further delay being grant
ed."
At the request of Ashe the case was
continued till May 1 for trtal, to which
Chadwick took an exception.

R. A. Smith, who is employed in a

victim to the extent of $200 of a get
rich-quick concern known as the
Fresno Diamond Company, with of
fices in the Academy of Sciences

Cabanlss for the arrest of W. A. Can
nady, the manager of the concern, on
a charge of felony embezzlement.
Smith alleges that his contract for
$200 expired last January, and when
he applied fbr the money it was re
fused. He further alleges that he and
others employed an attorney to ex
amine the books of the concern and
that a shortage of $40,000 was dis
covered. Subsequently the books were
again examined and the shortage was
only $22,000. This was brought about,
according to Smith, by Cannady mak

FEUD OF FAMILIES AGAIN
BEFORE THE COURT.
Judge Suggests Drawing of Lots to
Decide Which Shall Move.
GIVEX A WEEK TO BBIjVG ABOUT PEACE
JAMES C. CRAWFORD
Since the Stout-Zimmerman inter
family feud first found ventilation in
the Police Court about a year ago it
has developed many skirmishes, but
not until, 7 o'clock last Sunday even
ing did it attain the form of actual
fistic combat. At that time Patrol
man McKenna arrested Master Arthur
Zlrnmerman and Master Milton Stout
for fighting on the roadway in front
of their respective homes on the 800
block of Potrero avenue, near Twenty
fifth street. The boys, neither of
whom has yet reached the age of
shaving, were coatless and hatle3s,
and Master Zimmerman's upper !ip
and right eye had been severely smit-
! ten by his opponent, who was un
scathed and apparently winning the
bout when the policeman stopped it.
In the court of Judge Mogan the com
batants were charged with having dis
j turbed the peace, and as they stood
before the bench each of them was
flanked by a young and pretty sister.
Is it not superfluous to say that the
girls did most of the explanatory talk
! ing?
After patiently listening to a two
: sided review of the contention from
j the time that Master Stout was arrest
;ed for assaulting Zimmerman mere
j until the hostile clash on Sunday
i evening the Judge said that, in his
'. opinion, peace could only be restored
| to the neighborhood by the removal
I therefrom of one of the warring
j families.
"Thafs what I think." Miss Stout
briÃkly acquiesced, "and, of course,
the family to stay in the neighborhood
j is the family that hfte longest resided
!in it. We have lived there several
i years longer than these Zimmer
mans."
Miss Zimmerman demurred. "I
think," she ventured, "that the fam
ily to go is the family that is most to
blame for all this trouble. Any dis
interested neighbor can tell you,
j Judge, that these Stouts started the
fighting and have kept it up, picking
' on us all the time."
"Who is most to blameâ that's the
' question?" quoth his Honor. "Each
I of you avers that the other monopo
lizes the provocation and I don't know
which of you is telling the truth.
Now I'll offer another suggestion: Get
' together in amicable spirit â if you
1 can â and draw lots to decide who
shall go and who shall stay. I'll give
you a week in which to settle the mat
: ter, and if it is not settled when you
return here next Monday I shall pun
ish both of you defendants for dis
turbing the peace and increase the
J punishment every time a Zimmerman
! or a Stout is brought before me on
! complaint of the other. Now go and
| see if you can't sit down and talk it
i over without fighting."
They went, but not as a quartet,
i Indeed, the two young ladies did not
Â« deign to look at each other as they
swept from the tribunal.

Patrolmen Kracke and Bolton ar
rested Charles Picard in Chinatown
i because he refused to move on when
j they commanded him to do so, and
! after hearing the testimony Judge Ca
baniss pronounced the charge defective
and suggested that it be altered to that
!of disturbing the peace. So while the
i officers were filing an amended com-
I plaint in the warrant clerk's office Mr.
i Picard walked out of the courtroom
and he could not be found by his ac
cusers when they returned to prose
! cute him on the new charge. The
I Judge said that as the man had been
' dismissed it was up to the policemen
! to find him, and when they hinted that
ho eh nd have been detained in court
i durinu their brief absence his Honor
run. uke.: that if he had been properly
charged in the first instance an em
bÃ!i.ii--sir.g situation would have been
averted. Then the two stalwarts went
forth to seek the person who had
slipped through their fingers.

HEWITT SHOWS
A MILD SPIRIT
Does Not Appear Ready to
Fell Poles and Cut Wires
of Offending Companies
SUPERVISORS ARE ANGRY
Demand That the Electrical
Chief Furnish a List of
Permits He Has Granted
The Board of Supervisors yesterday
adopted a resolution directing the De
partment of Electricity "to file with
the board not later than April 10. 1905,
a list of names of persons, companies
or corporations to whom permits have
been issued since March 11, IMS. to
erect or lay telephone or telegraph
wires along or upon any of the public
streets of the city and county, or to
whom permits have been issued Inci
dental to the exercise of any other
privilege for which poles or wires are
required."
"I was very much surprised," said
Braunhart, who introduced the resolu
tion, "that permits have been granted
by the Department of Electricity to
various corporations to string overhead
wires, which permits are equal to fran
chises that in some cases could not be
granted by this board. It is an aston
ishing state- of affairs that a mere
cierk, without authority of law, has
taken it upon himself to give away
valuable privileges without consulting
the Mayor or Board of Supervisors."
TIME EXPIRES TO-MORROW.
Braunhart said also that the Direct
Telephone Company had asked the Su
pervisors for permission to string wires
overhead in the business district, that
the board had refused the request on
the ground that it had not the author
ity to grant it and that Hewitt had
subsequently granted the company the
authority asked.
The order of Chief Hewitt for the
placing of wires underground was mis
interpreted as to the time when the
work must commence. The forty-eight
hours' notice extends to 8 o'clock to
morrow morning, the hour of the issu
ance of the flat being fixed at 8 o'clock
a. m. yesterday.
A row between the various classes of
corporations that find electrical wires
necessary in their business may de
velop from the Hewitt order. It is
claimed by one of the lesser companies,
but at the same time an important one,
that one of the larger corporations is
forcing the issue in order to freeze the
smaller one out of a field that is work
ed as a side issue by the larger one.
This matter will probably come out be
fore the Board of Supervisors The
question of a corporation formed for
transacting a specified business leasing
its wires for the transaction of another
sort may be brought up in the expect
ed controversy.
The Western Union Telegraph and
the Pacific States Telephone companies
claim that they have been complying
with the ordinance for five years ex
cept to a limited extent. The great
majority of their wires are underground
and the few that are not, they say.
they have plenty of conduit accommo
dation for "and can place them out of
sight in a short time. The violations
of the law that these companies are
charged with are said to be due to the
fact that no attempt has been made to
enforce the ordinance against other
corporations that have been stringing
wires within the conduit districts.
CITY WIRES OVERHEAD.
"A peculiar feature of the situation,"
said an official connected with one of
the large electrical companies that uses
wires, "is that among the overhead
wires are those of the city. The mu
nicipality is one of the principal vio
lators of the ordinance. Another fact
worthy of note is that appropriations
aggregating $200,000 have been made by
the municipality for the laying of con
duits to accommodate its wires, though
the franchises of the Western Union
and the telephone company provide
that the city shall be permitted to place
its wires in them free of charge. It is
claimed by electrical people that the
city system of conduits could have
been laid for about half what it cost."
This charge may be due to anger at
the new order to bury wires, but those
making it claim that Investigation will
prove it.
Chief Hewitt when seen yesterday did
not talk or act like a man who was pre
pared to go out and hew. saw and
burn. In fact, he said that nothing sen
sational would be done. "This depart
ment has been subjected to a great
deal of criticism, and we are going to
carry out the provisions of the ordin
ance," he said, "but the enforcement
will be based on a reasonable Interpre
tation of the law."
It i? said that the burglar alarm and
messenger systems have the most over
head wires. It was thought that mes
senger systems were excluded from the
provisions of the ordinance, and the
burglar systems got permits under this
head also, but Hewitt's order embraces
all these companies. One theory ad
vanced for this is that h^ wishes to
force the hand of the Supervisors in the
matter and make them admit .that
these wires have a right overhead.
, "We will get underground when the
city does." said an official of a com
pany that comes under the messenger
service head. "As long as the municipal
wires are overhead I don't see why we
can't keer> ours there. What are we
going to do? Why. nothing, unless an
attempt is made to cut our wires; t en ,
we'll take legal action."

WONDERFUL CURE
Covered from Head to Foot with
Humours Forty Boils on Head
at One Timeâ Doctors and Drug
Bills $100â Baby Grew Worse.
CURED BY CUTICURA /
: FOR FIVE DOLLARS
! â *-
Mrs. George H. Tucker, Jr., 333
Greenfield Avenue, Milwaukee, Wis.,
is a grateful mother." "When six
months old," she says, " my little girl
' weighed a pound and a half less titan
1 at birth. When one month old a scab
formed on her face, spreading until it
! completely covered her from head to
foot, followed by boils, having forty
on her head at one time, and more on
her body. Then her skin started to
dry up, and it became so bad she
: could not shut her eves to sleep. OnÂ«
i month's treatment with Cuticura Soap
â¢nd Ointment made a complete cure,
and now my child is as large, strong, ;>; >
; and healthy as any child of her age.
i The doctor's and drug bills were over
one hundred dollars, and my baby
grew worse all the time. Then we
spent less than five dollars for Cuti-
; cura and cured her."
