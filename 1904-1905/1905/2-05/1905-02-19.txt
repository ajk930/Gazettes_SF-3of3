â¢yTI TRUE woman, a strong man.
I 1 arid a pood horse; love, strength
I I and speed. Because of these
X things this story.
But It did not start this way; not by
a great deal. At first it was only ban
ter. That was the way Beth looked at
Beth Cavendish. If Douglas Slade
was more in earnest that was his fault.
He was in indigo, up in Tirhoot, and
the planter's life tends to make one
take things more seriously than they
do in the service. For Beth was of the
army. Her father, who was a general,
and her brother and all the rest of the
Cavendishes were of the army. And
thf ; e its strength and speed and truth
and just a little of love, perhaps.
As for the seriousness of the thing,
as I have said, it was ail on his side.
That was the , atmosphere when they
said these things. It was in Calcutta.
He had really been skirmishing for an
openingâ so blunderingly that she
knew it.
"Marriage arid the before is not ro
mance." she said, looking very earnest
ly through the window and out across
the sun-scorched maidan that stretched
away to the stone feet of Fort William.
"It's dreadfully commonplace; it's al- .
most tragic in its dull ccMimercialness."
"Is there no romance of love, then?"
he said, feeling that some strong moves
were being made on the chessboard of
their little game.
"I suppose there is â of 'love'; but we
don't associate love with most of the
marriages we see, you know; they are
"arranged,* and^the result Is "
He waited fc-r her to finish the sen
tence, watching the gray eyes as they
came back drooping a little from the
glare of the hot sunshine. But she
seemed to be picturing the result to
herself and to have forgotton all about
his presence; so he added: "Disas
trous, eh?" ' ' , *
"Not always, of course. Now, if it
â were the old days, the old times when
men rode forth to battle for the lading
they loved, or paid they loved, it might
be different. Then a man had to dare
and do much to prove his. love. Now
It's simply a matter of arrangement."
Slade thought hopelessly of his posi
tion. He might vow to raise more indi
go than any other man in his district.
but that would hardly appeal to thi3
maid of a warlike race. His chances
were limited. He would willingly.un
dertake to thrash anybody, but there
was nobody to thrash. He felt quite
bitterly that what she said was true â
there was little of romance in his life,
little that was bright to offer her in ex
change for the pleasant existence she
led. Why should she go to live at his
stupid old bungalow, up in Tirhoot,
simply because he desired itâ loved her.
If you will? She had sadly demolished
hi? skirmishing line, but he must re
treat with a light heart, conceal the
dull little gnawing with banter.
"Yes," he said, "if we lived in those
days, or those days were now, I might
take your glove, tie it to my helmetâ l
really forget how they did fasten the
gloves on â end go up and down the
land knocking people about until you
â were quite satisfied witn the slaughter
and called me back to receive my re
ward. By Jove! I'd do it quick enough,
though,' he added, more to himEelf
thai; to his companion.
Beth smiled a little at this and said:
"You see the fates are against you;
there's no chance for you to show your
devotion."
"No; no chance," he admitted, trag
ically.
"Are you going to win any races in
Calcutta next meeting?" she broke in.
changing the subject abruptly, as
though his last words had settled the
other for â â :'. time.
'"So, I'm afraid I can't even win a
race. My ..horses are all crocksâ not
one aboveV.elling-plater form."
A merry liKht danced In Be'.Vs eyes.
Had she laid â  trap for him? "You
shall: be 'my knight-errant then. I "11
give you a task. Win me the Bally
g-unge CvÂ»."
His/ face fell. . "Something easy,
please " he begsred. ' "The me on. for in
stance, or Buddha's tooth from .Cey
lon. Any little bauble you may think
of."
"My knight rides not forth to battle
to-day, then?" said Beth.
"Oh, I'll .try it. of course." he added,
flushing a little; "try it, and not a hack
in my stable fit to pull a' dog-cart!
Only don't pluck' a fellow if he fails,
that's all. But I must have a gage â a
modern page in black and white." â 
The getting of the ; gage was too
tedious for telling, but It' read: ' .
"If Douglas' Slade win* the next Bal
lygunge steeplechase, I promise toââ"
and there she stuck.
He filled in. with his own hand, "Re
ward him." â  â  .
"You're to wear it on your casque,
you know," she said, as he folded it up
neatly. â ', ,- â â 
"Yes, I'll tie it in my racing cap when
I ride forth to battle' in the cup," he
raid- as he stood, one foot on the step
of his high dog-cart, and nodded pleas
antly to Beth. . "
"Now I'm in a hat." thought Slade to
himself as he drove to his hotel. "Win
the â  Ballygunge CUp with a lot of

Then he grabbed a lifeline that dan-
Bled down into his sea of despair. The
lifeline was . Captain Frank Johnson.
He wag standing at the door of the
hotel.
"By Jove!" said Slade. "you're just
the man I want, â¢ Johnson. If there's
anybody on / earth, or anywhere else,
that can help me out of this pickle,
you re the man, or fiend. -as . he case
may be."
Up in his room he told Johnson what
he had undertaken to do. The captain
whistled a merry note of derision.
"Do ; you know what you've run up
against?" he asked. "Lord Dick's got

of jewelry, and, bar him, there isn't
a horse in the country can beat Jovial,
who is in it, too.
"Id transfer my horse, Chang, to you
quick er.' ugh,"" continued Captain
Frank, "for I mean to start him; but
I'll tell you straight, if the other two
a me to the poet fit, I'll only win it in
something happens to both of
themâ in case they fall or run out, or
something of that sort. Neither of
them is apt to do that, though," he
continued, regretfully, "for they're both
crackers at the 'lepping' game."
"But I've got to win it," said Slade,
helplessly; and the look on his face
drew another whistle from the firm,
thin lips of the racing captain.
Johnson sat in deep thought for a
minute. "If it's as bad as all that."
he said presently, looking at Slade,
"'we'll have to hunt up a horse to beat
the both of them, eh? You've got noth
ing in your stable that a donkey
couldn't give pounds to. But Baldeck's
just landed a Waler, In a shipload of
horses from Australia, that if we can
buy and get fit in time will take a lot
of beating:. His name's Goldfinder. He
won over big timber in Australia."
Hope Is a good tonic, and the way
Blade rushed things until he had se
cured (.Toldfinder was appalling. Not
but that there was trouble over it, and
it realiy BOsmed as though everybody
fru in league to keep him from win
ning the cup. Baldeck wanted It him
in fact, had brought this horse
i ut to win it to take back to Australia.
Bnder's price, Â£500, was all right.
Slade gave that eagerly enough, and
he got over the difficulty of the cup for
Baldeck by agreeing that, if the horse
won. he would have a duplicate made,
in gold, if he liked, and give it to him.
This seemed a trifling and happy ar
rangement; but, like a good many other
triiiir.g things, it turned out serious in
the end.
You'll have to come up with me to
my place and get Go-ldflnder fit." Slade
said to Johnson. "I want to win this
race and then quit the turf. I'll have
something else to think of then." he
added impressively.
Jchnson and his own racing stable
were transported up to Tirhoot. There
was nu difficulty about this, for Cap
tain Frank had shed the army and was
a racing: gentleman pure and simple â
not co very pure and simple perhaps.
Slade agreed to make him a present
of (Joidfinder after the race was run
and won.
' We'll have a great chance to find
out how the new horse is going." Slade
remarked, "with Chang in the string.
Changs almost good enough, and if mv
Morse turns out a bit better, we'll scorch
them this trip."
While Slade and Johnson got the two
horses ready in Tirhoot, on the indigo
planter's estate, something else was be
ing got ready in Calcutta. That was
the working of one John Maynard's
mind over this same Ballygunge cup.
He was in the service, too. but that
uicin't matter. What did matter was
that he thought Beth Cavendish the
only girl he wanted to marry.
So while others worked faithfully in
Tirhoot, he trained a sprinter to go fast
for a mile, and jump viciously at every
thing in sight. Though Maynard'.s mor
als were slightly oblique, his pluck was
all right, and he never thought of his
"wn neck in the matter. t If he broke
the other fellow'sâ well, necks some
times do get broken in a steeplechase
over a stiff country.
"I think it's fairly satisfactory." he
confided to himself. "If by any chance
I fail to bring him a cropper, Lord Dick
is pretty sure to beat him out on Mus
ket." So he took a pretty heavy bet,
backing Lord Dick's horse to win a
small fortune. You see it was all gain
with him â love and coin.
Why Maynard had put Diabolo in no
body knew. Certainly he couldn't stay
the course, three miles and a half, and
he was well named Diabolo, for he had
tIM temper of a fiend. It bothered Cap
tain Frank not a little. That a man
of Maynard's cleverness should play
the fool was quite out of the question;
besides, Maynard could surely get
something that would go the distance
and have some chance of finishing with
the others. Then, when he found out
that Diabolo's owner had taken a long
bet about Musket's winning, he com
menced to do considerable thinking
suspicious thinking.
"I'll keep an eye on Maynard In the
race," he told Slade. "He played me a
bit of a trick once at Umballa and I
shouldn't mind wiping out the score.
Chang's a pretty big horse and be
tween us we can take care of ourselves
and somebody else, too, if it's
needed."
"What do you mean?" asked Blade.
"Nothing, only we'll sort of win the
cup between us. You'll sort of ride un
der my order and when I give you the
word in the race, do Just as I say, even
if it does seem a bit queer."
"I'll take your coaching, Frank, for
you know the game better than I do."
That was only two days before cup
day. Slade said nothing to Beth about
winning the cup. When he had won it
would be soon enough; if he lostâ well,
he had not lost yet, anyway.
'There'll be some collarbones cracked
to-day," said Captain Frank to Slade,
as they put on their silk colors in the
dressing room the day of the race. "The
top bamboos on all the Jumps are iron
bound and if any horse hits them hard
he'll come down for keeps and he'll stay
down, too."
"Dangerous, that, eh?" answered
Slad*. "Might upset our good thing."
"Hardly," said Captain Frank, with
his drawling twang; "somebody'll find
them dangerous, but you won't. Gold
finder'll fly them like a bird."
"What about Chang?" inquired Slade.
"Chang and his rider are all right,"
replied Johnson.
The terms of the race were simple
enough. It was a gentleman's race, for
all horses owned solely by members of
the Ballygunge Association. It was
open to all riders. This also was a
simple arrangement that turned out
very complicated at the end. i
Of course Beth was there; everybody
ROSES and hoar frost, sunshine
and snow, juvenility and senil
ity, life and decay, as applied
to matrimonial alliances might
better be summed up in the
two words, cupidity and putridity.
Marriages between young women
and an advanced stage of masculine
senility never occur save where the
aged wooer makes a fool of himself,
letting his bank account do the rest,
and where the aged wooer neglects
the slight formality of the marriage

ing a fool of himself, before or after
his obsequies, should he be alive or his
heirs, should he be dead, are very apt
to hear from the woman in the case
through a legal process.
An old man, particularly if he were
once something of a beau and can still
afford the price, never realizes that
he has grown old with a correspond
ing diminution of charm. There are
some few very lovable old men, but
as a rule, an old man is about as un
lovely and nonlovable as it is possible
for human to be. The great majority
grow exceedingly careless as to dress,
not wanting to bother even to keep
up the exquisite daintiness that was
the charm in youth. There is one type,
however, that is immaculately groomed
who still preserves the dignity of age
that appeals to the heart of every
woman. The lovable old man Is a
rarity, but when found women accord
him due homage. He is the elegant,
dignified gentleman. Chesterfieldlan of
manner, with too much dignity to fig
ure in unsavory scandals and midnight
orgies, and too much self-respect to
compromise himself. The opposite
type ig the silly old fool, who imagines
he is still young enough to make any
woman love him, and the woman who
is playing for high stakes and has an
eye on the emoluments thereof flat
ters him into the belief that he is

who was anybody was. It was the
"Grand National" of India. . Beth had
not thought that Douglas Slade would
take her banter seriously. Why had he
bought a horse that really had a good
;hance of winning the cvp â for people
were saying that he might win? Good
judges liked the big chestnut, and were
fcaying that he had a great chance.
Beth kept asking herself a knotty
question. "If Douglas Slade won, what
then?" He had kept so quiet about it
that she thought he had forgotten the
whole thing. Surely he was a valiant
knight. It would almost be too bad for
him to be beaten now. The thought
gave her a start. What if he should be
beatenâ he had been so plucky about it,
so determined?
And there, was the gage right enough,

book does so from purely disinterested
motives. Many of these old reprobates
have no intention of marrying and
would not marry under any circum
stances and yet they lavish every lux
ury on a woman who attracts their
fancy. A young woman will submit to
these senile demonstrations for the
sake of what it may be worth, when
there is no denying that there is noth
ing bo absolutely revolting as the ex
hibition that a giddy old Lothario
makes of himself.
Very few old men can make love to a
woman in a refreshing sort of way.
When, however, one does possess this
charming gift the woman must needs
be adamant to withstand his graceful
homage. But the old man as a rule, who
wants to make love to every woman

he meets, is generally a lascivious
reprobate, who is infinitely more in
trusive and disgustingly persistent
than a young man would ever think of
being. A snub that would crush a man
of 25 will act as r a spur or a stimulant
for 76; in fact, a real salacious old sin
ner is positively and absolutely irre
pressible.

A man is never too old to be foolish
and even a silly woman is like to hate
a foolish "nan. A young fellow who
makes a tool of himself is ridiculous
and either makes you laugh or makes
you too mad to see any fun in It. But
there is something downright sad and
pitiful In the foolishness of an old man
who ought to be making decent prepar
ations for a decent funeral in which he
would be the star attraction. The
scandalous stories that come out at
times anent these foolish, naughty old

just in front of him. Diabolo, Goldflnder
held Chang quite safe as far as win
ning went, he knew; his business was
to take care of Diabolo, and mayhap
his rider, for Captain Frank's suspicion
had become a certainty.
A steeplechase of three miles and a
half is not a spring in which the. start
counts for much; so they were soon
away, the silk jackets of the riders
snapping and cracking at the wind like
frost breaking away from the tightened
bark of trees in winter.
Beth said to herself that she
shouldn't care much, shouldn't take
much Interest in the thing; but when
the roar, "They're off!" beat up from
the inclosure below and went echoing
through the stand she felt that she had
three or four hearts in her breast, all
beating and hammering away with a
suffocating quickness. Still she did not
care â it was the excitement.
Over the first three fences they raced
like mad things; not at all like cool
headed riders In a big steeplechase.
"They'll soon crack up at
that pact," racing men said;
"it's too fast."

pulling at his head,
but the very devil was
in the horse.
Musket, Goldflnder and Chang
went In a bunch. Over the "post and
rails" and "drop fence" they still kept
up the terrible pace, Goldflnder making
the heart of Douglas Slade glad as he
skimmed them like a deer. "God and
my girl!" he muttered, quite like a
knight of old, as he felt the great
apringy chestnut rise each jump with
% mighty surge and come down on
the other side like a cat.

At the big mud wall Jo

swept by they saw Jovlal's

side, as though he had
been shot out of a cata

had got him back until
Chang's nose was on his
flask. On Chang's quarter
noÂ«d Qoldflnder.
' Johnson saw Maynard take a look
i over his shoulder at 81ade's mount.
"He'll try It on the in-an-out or thÂ«
big water Jump," thought Captain
i Frank.
The "in-and-out" was two big mud
walls about twenty feet apart. As they
1 neared it Johnson saw that Maynard
j was up to mischief. "He'll pull dead
across Goldfinder if I don't bring him
1 down," he thought.
i Four strides from the first wall May
nard looked around again. Goldfinder
was thundering along just behind
i Chang, who was still lapped on Dlabo
! lo's quarter.
Captain Frank saw the look, and the
1 short wrap that Maynard took in the
i right rein of Diabolo's bridle.
. "Pull back!" he yelled to Slade. and
drove the spurs into Chang's great
| flanks.
At that instant Maynard pulled Dl
i abolo's head short to the right as they
, lifted at the first wall. With a smash
ing crash Chang was Into him, chest
\ on. As the two went Into the dip, a
i smashed mass, Goldflnder took off at
their very heels, swinging slightly to
1 the left, and landed clear of the wreck.
i The second wall he cleared also, and
he and Musket, a length behind, raced
lon the level. Jovial was lengths be
i hind.
A cry of horror went up from the
' stand as Diabolo and Chang toppled
i over the wall in a broken heap. Beth
closed her eyes and turned white.
When she opened them the blue cap
Â» was skimming along like a bird. "Who
l fell?" she faintly asked.
"Captain Johnson and Maynard are
1 down," her companions replied. "I'm
. afraid there are backs broken there."
' It seemed wicked to feel glad when
i perhaps some one was lying dead be
tween those barriers, but her heart
certainly gave a throb of job at the
i answer that told her the owner of the
i blue cap was Slade, and still riding.
She was beginning to forget all about
1 the banter.
I Then the race itself began in earn
est Musket and Goldflnder were fight
ing like gladiators for the cup their
masters coveted so much. At the
water Jump, eighteen feet broad, they
came together, together they flew it.
1 A roar of applause went up from the
i straining, eager watchers.
Half a mile from home Musket's
head showed well In front. "Lord .
Dtck'll win," said Beth's companion.
"Musket's an Irish horse, bred to run
all day."
Beth's fingers clutched tightly the
handle of her parasol and she set her'
white lips firm and hard.
And so they came, around the cor
ner, and up the stretch and over
â always the same; the creamy
nose of Lord Dick's. roan always a
trifle in front. As they cleared the
last fence Slade seemed to send a thrill
of the pent-up energy of his frame into
Goldflnder and the big horse made a
last mighty' effort. ' Surely, slowly, Ms
golden nozzle crept up past thÂ» mot
tled head of the roan. Lord Dick's
whip . flashed in - the air and cut Mus
ket's quivering flanks. Slada sat per
fectly still, . crouched S ; low over thÂ»
withers of his horse, for he knew that
Goldflnder knew and was making his
last effort. There was no sound In tha
stand, nothing but thÂ© strained breath
ing of the people who waited.. â¢
Only . the Judges knew as they
flashed under the wire which had won.
Then the numbers went up and thÂ»
crowd knew. It was Goldflnder's race.
"Sorry for Lord Dtcit," said Beth's
companion, as they, set down; "but the
other chap. Slade. deserves it. Never
saw a gamer race in k my life."
Beth wasn't sorry for anybody. Her
: nerves were Jerking and twitching and
she felt that she never wanted to sea
another race in her life â one Just
like that, anyway.
'Two processions came into the stand
inclosure almost together. Musket
and Goldfinder formed one, while thÂ«Â»
other -consisted of two stretchers,
carrying Johnson and Maynard.
"A twisted ankle and a cracked rib
is no price to pay for a victory like
that." Captain Frank assured Slade;
"besides, I wiped that Umballa score
out."
Maynard was badly â¢ smashed up. }
too; collar-bone broken, and a badly
wrenched shoulder, but not beyond
the working of more mischief, though.

she -replied enigmatically. "You see

bets were till people come to pay. up."
"I don't know what I've won,
either." thought Slade. as Beth's com- -.
panion carried her off; "but I'll find
out to-morrow." v
That night Slade was having thÂ«
fruits of victory thrust upon him. $
They were having a little victory din*,

The letter was from Johnson. It.,

In vain did I struggle against the
desire to jump my job â the first one
of its kind since leaving Leadville
nearly six months before. And I need
ed the money, too. The canvas shoes
had blown up and sprung leaks In
various places below the waterline,
and my overalls stood in need of re
pairs and laundry attentions. The
rest of my toilet consisted of a short
coat, cotton shirt with collar attached,
necktie and hat. All through my
rambles I stuck to the tie â last rem

tie- stuck to me. The knot was jam-

Dat time me and Duchess took Mr.
Paul and Miss Fannie on deir wedding
joiney to Paris. Say, it's great.
LiEten: One day Mr. Paul, being a
fren of de A v mbassador, he goes around
to say howdy to him, and me having
tome errands he was to give me to do, I
goes wit him. I meets an old New
York boy dere what was messenger for
de Ambass. and he says would I like to
make a slide into de room back of
where Mr. Paul was and see what de
game was like.
'"Sure," I says, always being .willing
to loin a new trick in any old trade.
"Sure," I says.
So he chases me into a room where de
door was open, and I could hear de
t Ambass doing his tom; and I took a
peek now and den to see de mugs what
was' dere on business or for deir healt.
Well, well, it was as good as a play on
top of de stage.
"Hello, Paul." says de Ambass.
"How's tings at de dear old club?"
"Slow," says Mr. Paul. "Slow wit
out you to tell us a new story once in a
while."
"Say," says the Ambass, "I've got a
v new one I hears at Henry's de odder
day. Why is a Excuse me a min
ute; heare's a lady who made an ap
pointment by cable from London, and
I'H see her. Sit righ* where you are."
I peeks and sees a dame glide into
de room, and she was a swell rag: for
fair.
"Your Excellency," says she, as
soon as she caught up wit her breat,
"dis is so kind of you for to grant me
de interview at once, but de occasion

"Dosjt mention it, my dear

he knowed what was coming next.

On and Off the Bread Wagon
Being Hard Luck Tales and Doings of an Amateur Hobo
mcd and I couldn't undo it, let alone
lesing: the tie. Thus I looked nice in
spite of myself.
My molding tools had gone, the
Lord knows where; yet the Portland
Stove Company grabbed at me when
conscience impelled me to ask for
work. The job was the making of
lids for cook stoves. In size, weight,
color and shape those cast-iron lids
suggested the bread 1 had baked for
myself in the desert; and that re
minder helped to render me restless
and homesick. At the end of two days
the longing to be free tore me away
from the foundry, and I once more
took the road. I beat a river boat to
Kalama, from which point, it was said,
the wheat trains to Tacoma, Wash.,
were downy beds of ease for wander
ing tourists.
The man who piloted me against the
wheat train had not consulted the
latest guide book, for the grain was
sacked and loaded on flat cars; no
chance there for the stowaway. I al
lowed three trains to depart, and then
took a desperate chance, piling into the
caboose of the fourth and taking a seat
on the tool box. There was no one in
the caboose but the rear brakeman and
the conductor. The latter paid no heed
to me until the brakeman went for
ward; then the conductor, a young man
with big, solemn eyes, looked me over
and said:
"Ticket, please."
"Haven't any," I replied.
"Where are you going?"
"Tacoma."
"The fare is $4."
"I'm broke."
The conductor seemed prepared for
the worst. Without word or gesture
he turned away, and sat in an arm
chair at the side door of the caboose,
hanging his heels to a crossbar higher
than his head. He sat there at least
an hour, looking out into the woods,
while the train rumbled and jerked. I
huddled on the tool box, shaken with
nameless fear. Never had I met up
with that kind of conductor in all my
hobo career. Would he rise In slow
frenzy and slam me out the open door
or merely crack me on the coco with
an ax? were the agonizing questions
I asked myself. Much of the time I
did not breathe, and clammy moisture
stood on my youthful brow. Not once
did I take my eyes off the conductor.
At length the train halted at a small
Station where a creosote works was in
operation. Pine timbers for wharf
building were treated with creosote, in
vacuum vats, to offset the ravages of
the teredo, or salt water worm. The
conductor went out, leaving me on the
tool box. When the train started the
solemn-eyed railroader Â»esumed his
chair and motioned me to one near
him.
"I once knew an old fisherman at Ta
coma," said the conductor. "He had a
wooden leg made of pine. It was his
habit to stand for hours in the water
washing his nets. One Sunday, on the
way to church, the aged fisherman col
lapsed and fell on the street. The water
worms had bored into the wooden leg
resembling impunity tinder any imag
inable circumstances almost deserves
the fate to which she is rushing head
long.
Finally the deal was made and Mrs.
Stubbs settled down to play the quiet
band of matrimony. Stubbs still con
tinued to tell her of his heroic exploits,
although there was here and there a
noticeable absence of circumstances
and detail that should have warned
Mrs. S. But she, poor, foolish soul,
looked and worshiped, and worshiped
the more the longer she looked. How
she pitied the other women who wers,
compelled to satisfy their starved
hearts with imitation men who never
talked back when the elevator boy told
them to step lively or rebuked the
floorwalker for his haughty indiffer
ence. Night after night they were
"Delighted, madam," says Ambass.
"Alphonse," he says to to. cloik, "write
down de address of de dog doctor of
de Duke of Umterara."
Well, de lady takes de address,
tanks de Ambass, and floats out.
"Paul," says his Excellency, "dis Is
de best you ever heard. I was passing
Henry's de odder day and I hears it.
Say, it'll knock you siiiy when I pass
it on to you. But wait ft minute, here

wort a billion, and subscribes liberally
â under pressure â to de campaign

I rubbers, and sees a mug who looks
like ready bank notes, and he was mad
for fair.
"General â Mr. Ambassador, I mean
â I know you are a busy man, but dis
is a matter dat won't wait; not if dere
is a navy and army in de United States
to take it up. A cabby charged me two
francs ninety-five sous for a ride from
de Hotel Grand to de Place de la Con
corde. I'd walked it if he'd been
honest enough to tell me it was so
short a distance, but he overcharged
me in de bargain. I want de French
Government to be told by you dat
dey has twenty-fouf hours to 'pologize
and retoin de overcharge wit interest
or prepare to go to war."
"Sir," says Ambass, "dis is serious,
indeed. Did de cabby wear a white
hat or a yellow one?"
"A white one," says ,de mug.
"Ah!" says Ambass. "Ah, dat is
fortunate. We have a way of collect
ing overcharge from de white hats
witout going to war. If it had been
a yellow hat I'd ordered Mr. Root to
have de army shipped in a minute.

and honeycombed it. When he fell the
splintered wood stuck out through his
pants, and large numbers of people
fainted at the sight. As the old fisher
man was very poor, his pals and the
sawmill hands at Tacoma gave a bene
fit dance and got him a creosoted leg.
It was built at the works we just
passed."
Affer purging his system of this re
markable narrative the conductor once
more lapsed into gloomy contemplation
of the pine woods. Whether the story
were true or the creosote works in
spired it I do not know. And I was
puzzled about my partâ whether to
laugh or to view the creosote leg as a
profound scientific achievement. A
giggle escaped me, and the conductor
smiled. He had tried his story on the
dog, and It was a success. Lucky laugh;
also lucky dog.
The conductor put the pump on me,
and I told him stories about my trou
bles and travels, after which he related
some. Nothing more was said about
railroad fare and tickets. We were
chums, all right. It was after 6 o'clock
in the evening when the train reached
the outskirts of Tacoma, which town
was so new it creaked. The foundry had
closed for the day, but the conductor
knew where the boss lived. He pointed
out the house from the hurricane deck
of the caboose, and slowed down the
speed of the Mrain so that I could get
off and save the long walk back from
the depot. After all, there is much in
knowing when to laugh at the right
time, but alas! my tact availed me nit.
The Tacoma foundry didn't need expert
help, so next day I turned my prow to
the sea.
A big wooden ship, the Martha
Rideout of Boston, was loading lum
ber for San Francisco. I found her
captain and another salt-water
skipper playing 1 pool on a waterlogged
table in a saloon. While the master
mariners banged the balls I hung in
the background until my skipper beat
the other fellow and hoisted in some
free drinks amid great laughter.
Deeming the moment propitious, I
butted in and asked the pool sharp to
let me work my passage to 'Frisco on
his ship. Talk about diplomacy and
smooth work! Such was the skip
per's good humor he placed his hand
on my shoulder and said:
"Why, certainly, young fellow; go
right aboard."
I went right aboard and helped
stow soggy lumber in the hold, which
job lasted thirteen days, working
from daylight to dark. Then we
towed up Mr. Puget's Sound, sailed
out through the .straits and headed
for the golden shores of California.
Four days and nights I lay in the
same locker, the sickest hobo that
ever plowed, harrowed and sowed the
raging main. On the morning of the
fifth day the Chinese cook slid back
the door of the locker and tossed in
a chunk of cold raisin duff the size
of a cabbage. The lump rolled down
under ray nose, and I struggled feeb
forced to creep home to the wives of
their bosoms and confess in faltering
accents that they had been trampled
on and abused and forced to take a
back seat generally, while Stubbs, im
perious Stubbs, went on his conquer
ing way exacting tribute from all and
several for his overmastering powers
of body and mind.
If Stubbs could have kept his wife at
home all the rest of her life and com
pelled her to take his word for every
thing that happened to him he might
have kept up the bluff without any
trouble, barring the liability of some
kind friend to butt in and give him
away.
Something like that happened to
Stubbs. He thought himself secure In
the recesses of his office, where only
the typewriter's copy and the office
boy's cigarettes were vil^ but one day
there came the Â«Â»wish of silken skirts,
Dats all. I'll recommend you a law
yer who will let you off for half you
have. It won't take you more dan a
year. Den come to me."
"Can't you fight wit France witout
all dat preliminary sparring?" says de
mug.
"It wouldn't be polite," says Ambass.
"We'll fight if we must, but we'll be
polite if we bust."
"I taut we had a government dat pro
tected de sacred rights of its citizens,"
says de felly, getting red in his whis
kers, and he chases.
"De story, Paul," says Ambass, like
he'd had an every-day job. "De story
will knock your eye oift You see, de
Countâ was it de Count story I was
telling?â de Count had a brodder-in
law who was by way of being a bal
loonist and â Here we go again. Dis one
will be easy. Excuse me a minute."
De usher fetches in a dippy looking
chap wit red eyes, and very long fin
gers, out of which he was trying to
pick tacks, from de looks of what he
was doing to 'em.
"Mr. Ambassador," he says, like de
actor on de stage who always has
shiver music to speak wit, "it's all
right."
"Good!" says Ambass, like his long
line of stocks had jumped ten points.
"Good!"
"Dere is a secret alliance between
England and Germany in de Interest of
de Mutterbund; de Czar is dead and de
Grand Dukes has put a stuffed scare
crow on de trone td fool de people;
Italy is to de bad, but Bohemiaâ Hist!
Bohemia refuses to consent, and war
will follow unless peace is preserved."
"I shall communicate wit President
Roosevelt at once and he will appre
ciate your services."
"Tanks," says Dippy. "In de mean
time, me dear Mr. Ambassador, If
you could advance me one franc sixty
from the Secret Funs â "
"Don't mention it," says Ambass,
passing out Dippy a piece dat looks
like a quarter.
"Well, Paul," Bays Ambass, when
Dippy had faded aw;ay, "de story Is
ly with the dawn of a newer and
brighter life. Desire to live grew
with the absorption of the duff, and
in a little while the whole mass dis
appeared. In a day or v so I felt like
Â«a new hobo. The cook made up a
bed for me in his chest in the galley,
and when the ship neared 'Frisco that
heathen Chinee loaned me a pair of
his overalls while I washed mine, so
as to make a flash at San Francisco.
With $1 20 in my clean overalls' pock
et â a purse contributed by the sailors â
I passed in at the Golden Gate, which
so many find hinged on mud. That was
the way it swung for me. The ship dis
charged all hands save the captain,
mate and cook, and I went ashore with
the rest. In a short time I became de
monetized, and there was no work in
sight. Night after night I went back
to the Martha Rideout and sneaked
into her forecastle via the bows of an
other boat lying alongside. The Chi
nese cook alone knew of my presenda.
He kept the secret from the captain,
permitted me to sleep in the forecastle
and had always a little wooden tub of
food hiddfn in the bunk I occupied.
That Chinaman was the only friend I
had in California, and when the ship
cleared for more lumber she left me
bankrupt and starving.
Dear old Sing Wah! I never expect
to have another pal like him. When
Sing sailed away I wept, but wouldn't
like my old friend, Denis Kearney, of
sand lot fame, to know about it. In
later years Denis and I got quite chum
my and wrote for the same paper In
and Mrs. Stubbs swooped down on him.
It was only a casual call, and all might
have gone well had not the head of the
firm bethought him of a bad break
that Stubbs had made the day before
and dropped in to tell him about it. His
language was pointed and no more ele
gant than the presence of a lady de
manded, and when he got through with
Stubbs that gentleman looked like a
last year's apple in a dark corner of
the deserted bin whence all but him
fled.
Mrs. Stubbs held her breath, waiting
for the storm to break, and was on the 11
point of beseeching Stubbs to spare the
old man for the sake of his gray hairs
and dependent family. She waited long,
but the storm failed to appear accord
ing to schedule. Instead Stubbs got
red and pink and white and blue and
several other assorted colors, and
about a chap what was fishing for
goujon at de restaurant of de Miracu
lous Fishing â nice place to take your
breakfast, by de way."
"Hold on," chips in Mr. Paul. "Do
you have many like dat last caller?"
"Oh, he's easy. He only gets a
franc a call and is harmless. But dis
story. You see, de lady was crossing
de Rue de la Paix, in front of de Eng
lish tea shop, when all of a sudden â
hold on a minute, here's de usual
ting, from de looks of dis card," and
anodder mugâ a fly looking felly â
comes like a flatiron breeze.
"Me dear Mr. Ambassador, I don't
know wedder you remember me. You
dined at me fadder's home in Chicago
â Michigan avenue, you know, and
dat sort of ting. Dad told me to be
sure and call to pay me respects to
you and say he'd have a solid dele
gation from our State for you in de
next national convention," rattles off
de fly one.
"So kind," lisps Ambass. But say,
he had his icy eye on guard.
"And you can do me a little service,"
says de fly bay. "I'm not known at de
bank, so me letter of credit â for a
trifle of ten thousand â Is no good yet.
If you could let me have five hundred
francs until I get me letter vvoiking
fadder wil be pleased."
"Alphonse," says Ambass, quiet like,
"call de police!"
But de fly boy beat Alphonse to de
door.
"Dis story, Paul." says Ambass,
lighting a cigarette, "Is about a man
who played de bass fiddle in de old Nib
lo's Garden on Broadwayâ bless it! â
and he was bow-legged, so when he
stood vp â Excuse me one minute.

account in that same town. The bank
buSted, too, with my coin In it, but this
story carries enough tough luck of its
own without lugging in a Chadwlcked
bank.
However, after Sing Wah left I be
came despondent and ill, and could get
nothing to lay on my stomach. It
would have lain, could I have got any
thing solid. On the afternoon of the
second day without food, fax out in
Valencia street, I found a dime, and
I've never seen a silver dollar that
looked as big. Once In the possession
of capital, there came the worry and
care incident to safe investment, and
how to get the biggest returns, but I
knew where to go. On lower Market
street the curb was lined with fruit
peddlers' wagons. Each cart had a
board nailed upright on the seat, and
over the board was drawn a paper bag
on which the hucksters posted the odds
â 6 for 5, 13 for 10, and so on. After
a careful inspection of the field, I play
ed a long shot â sixteen large, bug-bit
ten Bartlett pears for a dime.
The side pockets of my coat had
broken through Into the lining, which
mishap made a sort of blind tunnel
around my spine. Into this secret cav
ern I poured the sixteen pears, and had
a grub supply for a couple of days.
Whenever hunger assailed me, which
was often, I reached in and hauled out
a pear.
Before famine time came on again
I got work in a little jobbing shop in

he explained to Mrs. Stubbs that he

hard and taught him his pJace gener

The incident was not mentioned
again, but Mrs. Stubbs sat herself
down to do a large consignment of

\^ v I moment the other morning
X with Miss Hackett in her
arms. She was dressed in a clover
blossom pink albatross trimmed with
bands of taffeta of the same colors.
Little Kiss Hackett was in white nain
sook, with long skirt fully tucked and
puffed sleeves with fink bows. Upon
her left arm were her initials, done in
tiny script. Mrs. Haclfcett has the pret
tiest assortment of negligees in.town.
The materials for negligees are al
batross, cashmere, veiling and voile.
Theee make very pretty house dresses,
and though not as new as some of the
materials of the season they make very
acceptable dresses. There is something
about these goods which wins its way
to the feminine affectionâ a certain
softness, an adaptability, a luster and
dignity which makes them first favor
ites when one ie choosing one's gown.
Mrs. Reginald Vanderbilt and other
women who have gowns In quantity
can afford a variety. They can have
both silks and wools. They will ding
to cashmere and veiling for cold days.
But for pleasant morning and for re
ceptlon mornings they will select the
Peking stripes, the Habutai, the Loin
sine, the foulard, the India silks, the
soft batistes, and the Oriental " goods.
They will have these â  thin lusterful
silks, which are so pretty and becom
ing^
Then there is another variety of
morning dress, and this is the durable
variety. Cashmere and voile and veil
ing and albatross are all very pretty.
But when it comes to genuine durabil
ity there is nothing that can vie with'
Pongee, poplin and the new brilliantine,
which is soft to the hand and which
looks precisely like silk.
"I make up three house dresses of
poplin to one of flannel," said a woman
whose negligees are her specialty. "I
take the thinnest and softest of poplin
in the delicate shades and I make up
the material precisely as though I was
handling taffeta. One can do a great
deal with this material, it is so very
soft and pretty, yet so durable. â  '..

A Display of Tea Gowns.
Upon Fifth avenue the other day
there was a display of tea gowns. The
opening took place in a very fashion
able hotel where a room on the ground
floor had been rented for the purpose.
No less than fifty magnificent tea
gowns were spread out and the callers
were invited to examine them and note
their peculiarities. They were of two
classes, the domestic and the imported,
and. of the twe, it can be said that
the domestic were the most attractive.
All the new tea gowns begin to show
full pyffs at the shoulders and this has
a tendency to make the figure look a
great deal broader. The full shoulder
puff Is something welcomed back by
every woman and it is very likely that,
by Easter, every gown will show a
Tea Grows and
Negliges
trace of shoulder puff. The Easter
Pi'ades in negligee are interesting.
There are distinct negligee or tea
Sown colors. And among
these can be mentioned onion
skin, red-currant and apri
cot.. These are very pretty
tones and are much lees deli
cate than the pale tones-
â¢' ""They ".-.â¢â¢ v are

; woman who makes |
.many tea gowns,

that the gown is
to be worn indoors

The new tones are

there is mustard

is iron gray, which
is | good combined
â¢with red. ; The
most important
feature for a tea
gown is its color.

"After the. color

: luster. . And for
this vi one: can
f recommend the
Oriental silks.
If one is
> choosing V a
f;; dressy tea,
gown, or the silk poplins. And laat of
all comes the style and the fit."
The successful tea sown of domestic
make show a variety of style. But all
have large sleeves with plenty of ma
terial in them. There is the robe which
is loose in the front and fitted in the
back and which is trimmed up the
front breadth with little ruffles of Vai
eneieunes lace. The back is sweeping
in Its length and is trimmed with a
sash or with deep flounces.
The Skirt and Petticoat Style.
There Is v style of tea gown which
has the dressy lpok of a handsome
rcbe of the Elizabethan days and
again of the 1840 days. There is the
bodice with its long train, while in the
front there is a petticoat, beneath
vhich her little slippered feet peep
out.
The gown and petticoat style is one
â which appeals to woman who enjoy
picturesque dressing. And it is a style
which can be adapted to gowns for
either day or evening, though It is
more appropriate to day gowns. The
petticoat is, of course, a petticiat only
iv name, for the material must be ele
gant and the style exquisite, while the
finish, the trimming and the length
are all of the most admirable quality.
It is not a utility petticoat.
They take brocaded satin in a
tender shade of blue, or pink, or yel
low, and make it up into the loveliest
petticoats, which fairly rustle as one
walks. And over these petticoats,
which are elaborately trimmed
down the front, Is worn a skirt,
the length of whose train sug
gests the statelinesa of the
court trains.
The woman who is the owner
of a handsome tea gown which
has faded and gone to seed
generally can make it very
new by supplying it with a
handsome girdle, which she
can fasten with a great big
buckle.
This settles the question
of the waist or upper part.
As for the skirt, she can
cut it open down the mid
dle of the front and do
one or two things with
it. -She vcan face it
with a band of heavy
white lace. Or she
can drape it back In
Watteau style. This
open front reveals
a petticoat which, by the way, should
bp a ruffled one, handsome as can be
made.
Dame Fashion seems to have no ob
jection to displaying her underwear
providing it be handsome. She does
not stickle at showing her lingerie if
it be of the right sort. And the pet
ticoat which was once very much
buried in oblivion, and -which is de
signed at most only to peep out a lit
tle, is now brought boldly to the front
to be displayed when the skirt is slit
open from the belt to the floor.
And there is still another way of
making the skirt and petticoat gown.
And this is by a make-believe or simu
lated petticoat. You trim the front
breadth with little ruffles running from
side to side, while the back is long to
â¢make a plain court train. This gives
the petticoated effect.
Handwork Pretty, but Expensive.
But. oh dear, how is one to describe
all the negligees and where shall one
stop in a^study of the tea gown? There
is no limit at all to them and the wom
an who tries to follow them will be
lost in a hopeless maze of color and
material in which each garment will
ssem finer than the last one.
The white hand embroidered peig
noirs are indescribably lovely and
equally expensive. One cannot imagine
anything prettier nor costlier. One can
easily spend a little fortune upon them.
Tc pay $50 for a simple little India
linen peignoir with hand-made and
hand-embroidered ruffles is nothing at
all. And to pay $100 Is not out of the
ordinary.
Little Lady Mary Montague, baby
daughter of the Duchess of Man- ,
Chester, entertained her young friends ,
the other morning in a simple little
white frock embroidered with white
rose sprays, the hand work upon which
came to 550; while her pretty young
mamma, the Duchess, wore a peignoir
with front ruffles and ruffles around
the bottom that were edged with lace
which cost more than many an evening
gown. Such is the story of some of
the pretty peignoirs of the year. '
The button question is most inter
esting when considered along with
negligees. The negligee gains so much
by the addition of a couple of buttons
upon the cuff or upon the rever that
one wonders why all dressmakers do
not take advantage of thfs style of
trimming.
No matter when buttons were li>
vented It Is certain that they were very
much used in the time of Napoleon 111,
and it Is certain that the Empress
Eugenic wore them and loved to trim
fcer gowns with them. They seem to
make a trimming of their own which
is both interesting and effective.
Buttons are made of all materials.
They are made of turquoise, which,
with a little rim of gold around the
edge, Is as pretty as it can be. And
they are made of rubber, or enamel, of
gun metal and silver and gold. Every
substance is brought into play these
days to produce pretty button decora
tions.
But by far the most interesting but
tons, from the standpoint of the tea
gown, is the button that is covered
with silk and hand-painted. There is a
ptrrect craze for these buttons, and
the girl who can paint a set of buttons
for her tea gown is pretty sure of
securing something modish.
Easy to S;>cnd $100.
A charmiug set of buttons showed
a pann< silk taffeta background, upon
which * re painted clover leaves, the
familiar * Mr-leaf clover spray being
the favorite Another set of buttons
was covered vith brown panne vel
vet, upon which there were pink roses
painted. There is no limit to the sub
jects and their execution.
The Fifth-avenue woman who or
dered a set of buttons, consisting of
only six, and who paid $100 for the
set, is only one of many who are will
ing to spend money in that manner.
One can easily pay $100 for a set of
blue crystal buttons set with rhine
stones. Or one can pay $100 for a
set of white crystal buttons set with
turquoise. One can let the cost mount
up well if one is looking for a chance
to spend one's money that way.
But the little woman who wants to
lcok pretty on little can get along with
a set costing, say $1 for six. And with
these she can accentuate a cuff or
trim a rever with the most satisfac
tory results.
The negligee has reached the skirt
and jacket stage. And it is really very
good form to wear a pretty silk petti
coat with a little silk jacket. Or one
can wear the silk petticoat and a hand
somely trimmed jacket o-f silk flannel.
A woman who entertains a great
deal at luncheon â preferring that
from of entertainment to any other,
for it is one that pleases the ladles
most â wore at a January luncheon a
handsome silk petticoat made of onion
skin colored taffeta. It was trimmed
with rows and rows of silk put on in
scallops. And between these rows
there were rows and rows of Valen
ciennes lace. The lace was white and
the ruffles were of a deeper shade of
onion skin, making a very pretty
skirt. The cut was tight on the hips,
with the fashionable petticoat flare
around the knees.
The jacket was made of white al
batross, prettily trimmed with silk ruf
fles to match the petticoat. A little
white lace yoke with necker attached
was worn inside the throat of this
jacket.
Jewelry With House Dresses.
With the negligee it is not very good
form to wear strings of beads nor a
great deal of jewelry. But one can
wear bracelets. Indeed, these are worn
with gowns both for day and evening,
for it is a year of bracelets. The slen
der gold bands are worn, and also the
wide, old-fashioned bracelet, which
fastens with a clasp and is held by a
little gold guard chain.
There are two styles of bracelets â the
very wide band with the clasp and the
narrow rims of gold, which are slid
upon the arm and which are pushed up
and down to make them set gracefully
and becomingly. From ten to twenty
of these narrow bracelets are worn, and
though they are of new design they
look surprisingly like the bangles of
long ago, when bangles were worn by
every woman.
There are Egyptian bracelets, very
thin, very wide and set with colored
stones. These are clasped around the
arm, and a wide band to â  match is
fastened around the throat. This is one
of the latest fashionable fads. Although
jewelry is not popularly supposed to be
part of a negligee, it is perfectly allow
able to wear these ornaments around
the -neck and wrist.
If the gold chain is worn let it be
tiny and let there be something useful
fastened to it, such as the silk reticule
or the work bag, for it is again consid
ered smart to carry one's work bag
with a tea gown or with a negligee or
with a jacket and skirt.
This is not a corset talk, but have
you seen the new corsets? They are
made of flowered brocade, too pretty to
be passed by without notice, and they
are lined with another color â pink or
blue. You can buy the loveliest corsets
for so very little these days. But if you
feel like paying more you can go up,
higher in the prices.
The beautiful white satin brocades
come at upward of $25, trimmed with
lace, embroidered around the upper
edge and lined with a pretty color. And
there come other handsome corsets,
not made of satin, but exquisite to the
last degree.
Fashionable women are taking plain
white corsets and trimming them with
lace around the top, putting on the
lace in little drapings across the front.
It is caught up with ribbons. Inside
there are set many little ruffles of silk
to produce a fullness across the bust.
A trousseau set consisted of ten
pieces. There were the usual pieces
of underwear to put next the skin.
These were made of nainsook and
trimmed with pale blue dyed lace,
with satin ribbons, very narrow and
tied In many rosettes. A white cor
set was trimmed with pale blue lace,
and there was a night robe Hinmed
in the same way, with fewo petticoats
to match. With this set there went a.
little kimono Jacket, cut off Just below
the waist line and elaborately trimmed
with novelty phvid taffeta, laid on in
flat bands.
Washable Silk Underwear.
It is very smart these days to have
all one's underwear, even to one's cor
sets, washable, nd the best of fancy
silk petticoats are now made of w
able silk. The new washable silk
triumphs in the art of silk ma.
and the wash silk shirt waists
wash silk dress skirts would surprise
the old-fashioned dressmaker of a few
years ago, who labored under the im
pression that silk would spot If wet.
Two-thirds of the summer silks ara
washable.
They are promising many novelties
in the wash silk line and all women
should do well to watch out for them,
for they will be handsome and well
adapted to nice wear as well as to
common wear. "To imagine that wash ""
silks are for every day is a great mis
take," said a modiste, touching with
proud fingers a piece of silk that lay
before her, "for our new qualities; are
as fine as any that ever graced a ball
room. They are for evening wear."
The bertha saves many a gown from
mediocrity. And the tea gown Is no
exception to this. With a pretty lace
bt-rtha one can make a tea gown dressy
and almost elegant. The bertha should
be of nice laca and should b* care
fully fitted to the gown. A great deal
depends upon the fit of the neck of
any gown, for house or street, and it is
by the way the neck Is managed that
one judges the gown and its dress
maker.
They take piece lace and cut the
bertha out of it. Or they buy tha
handsome lace berthas all mads and
ready for use. But a prettier method
and a newer one is to make a littla
yoke of taffeta, with stock attached,
and to trim it with narrow rows of
lace In bertha fashion. Thus one gets
the effect, the finish, the workmanship
and ail, combined in one.
In making your negligee, or teagown,
remember that It is governed by very
much the same laws and the same
styles that govern the street dre
Indeed, one can take one's street
dresses, and, with .very little trouble,
make them over Into house gowns. It
takes just a little remodeling, provid
ing, of course, that the material be
suitable. One can work to good ad
vantage with an old taffeta street
gown as a background. And one can
do wonders with an old street dress
of foulard or India silk.
When making over you*, street
foulard Into a house dress, remember
that the coin dots are fashionable.
And do not forget that the coin spots
add much to the beauty of a material.
Moreover, they change its complexion
decidedly, so that It looks like new.
A woman who dresses very prettily
at all times took, the other day, an old
street dress of plain India silk and.
leaving the ruffles precisely aÂ» she
found them, she sewed coin dots of
Shite taffeta all over the gown. She
len took a little of the material and
attached frills to the blouse waist and
made a girdle to wear with it. Now,
by cutting open the sleeves and ar
ranging them to wear with under
sleeves, and fixing tha yoke in bertha
fashion, she soon had W-'Wy pretty
little luncheon dress wWch cost noth
ing except the time and the trouble.
One might add that she lengthened the
skirt by setting a ruff!* around tha
bottom of It and edging the roflle
with deep, soft lace.
llow to Make Your House Gown.
There is a house (own with Spanish
ruffles that is sometimes called a Eula
lle. Very full, very long, open In front
and cut low in the neck. It la a thing of
comfort and of beauty. Of course, all
then small appointments muat be in
keeping and this calls for a soft taffeta
petticoat harmonizing in color and for
beautiful embroidered stockings and
slippers whose heels and toes match
the gown.
The embroidered slipper toe fci a
thing which makes the foot look
smaller, while the little brilliant
buckle, set in the middle of the fat lit
tle velvet rosette, is a form of slipper
trimming which is much seen.
For the making of the peignoir thet a
ere many materials. A modiste, who
had' been engaged to build a trous
seau for a very fashionable girl, has
been asked to select the material! for
six tea and room gowns. She calls
them tea gowns, lounging robes, ki
monos, peignoirs and room jackets.
And her materials are China silk, Jap
anese silk, shantung, sheer India mus
lin, soft taffeta and lace.
And to her list she is going to add
one room dress of brilliant blue satin.
She will make it in grande dame style,
with full shirred skirt, blouse waist
and with an immensely deep sailor col
lar of lace. This makes the moejt ex
quisite room gown, one that can be
slipped^ on all of a minute when
morning callers are unexpectedly an
nounced and when one would look
dressy without going to the trouble of
putting on a tight gown.
There come very soft lustrous silks
that are handsome for the morning.
Silk, if well selected, in the oriental
weaves, wears a long time, and it is
so very comfortable that the luxury-
Icving woman will scarcely deny her
self this boon.
The long, straight lines are the
thing. Yet there Is something of-a re
turn to the 1360 tea gown, that thing
that was worn before the war. It is
round in tLe skirt, round in the waist
and there is a girdle to which tha
woman who wants to be picturesque
will hang a silver key, the key to her
linen closet.
It is almost a rule that all sleeves
shall be Â«ll and wide and slightly
flowing. "The fuller and wider ana
more flowing the better, if tt Is i

ON WAR
AND PRAYER
O-f TRAVELING evangelist who
' f I had halted for the night at old

J[ that he hoped to see the time
when there would be no more war,
when the old man remarked: "Yes,
and I reckon King Darid hoped to see

are two sets of prayers that don't ap

for rain and prayer for war to cease.
But there never was but one time when
there want no war nowhere on the
earth, and that was when rain want
needed. I refer to the time of the flood,

itself is more humane, that men are
killed in a softer and gentler way
Jjbianjbefore, And then we read, ot
Why Does Not the World Get On Faster?
gress so slow?
Well, one reason ia that, beneficent
as nature is, her forces are not uni
formly employed in man's behalf. Fire,
whirlwind and flood still, as ages ago,
do their destructive work, laying low
high structures, destroying lives. There
is always suffering and want some
where and as long as we are unable
to control t the elements we shall have
with almost periodic regularity the
disasters and scourges which impede
the progress of the race.
Man himself hinders this advance.
Left to his own devices and unre
strained by moral ideals he engages
in a fierce scramble with his fellow
men for the spoils. He wants the
biggest plum in the pudding, the
highest measure of personal pleasure
and lordship over others, no matter
if sometimes to achieve his end he has
to trample Ttpon the rights of others.
The beast of every man shows his
fangs too often and until he is ele
vated to a higher level by education
or conversion, or by whatever influ
ence you please, man is just as likely
to retard the progress of the race as
he 's to promote it.
Considering, then, these two deeply
related forces that are preying upon
and bruising the life of the world, it
gets on, in the main, pretty well. Con
sidering all the germs floating about
and liable to lodge themselves in any
of us at any moment, is it not a won
der that people live to be 50 or even
barbed wire and entrenchments full of
(â pikes and secret mines ready to blow
a whole division of an army into the
clouds. But after all, war is war. and
when a man's killed, no matter whether
it's with one of these nice little bul
lets or a snortin' minnie ball, he's
dead, and so far as he is concerned the
whole earth has been split asunder. I
recollect that while our Civil War was
a goln' on the folks over here at Eben
eezer rr.eetin' house used to assemble
and pray for it to end. Old Lisre An
derson was the principal prayer, and
sometimes it seemed that he would
command the Lord. He never came
into the house of prayer that he didn't
hive some special information for Prov
idence. Yes, he was goin' to Y\p\d the
Lord personally accountable if the war
didn't end putty soon. The folks that
had been conservative with Providence
after a while turned radical, and I re
member that we were all misrhtily as
tonished one night when Lige he sud
denly flopped."
The preacher looked up in aston
ishment, and the old man explained:
"To flop." you know, "means to
make a quick break for the other
side. Yes. Lige he flopped. And the
cause of his sudden turning was this:
He come into possession of a beef
contract for the army. I don't rec
ollect whether the Government got
afraid that he might have an influence
with the heavenly powers or not. but
at any rate he got the contract. And
the next m^f:n' afterward when old
Brother HasXill had poured forth the
usual dose of lament because the
war hadn't come to a close, why Ligs
he suddenly gets up and without
strikin' the usual attitude of prayer,
snorts out. "Lord, before any action
is taken I think it would be better
to use your own judgment in this
matter.-" Of course we would all like
to see the war close â when you feel
that it ought to close, but ' "
"The blasphemous old beast," said
the evangelist.
"Well, yes," Limuel admitted, "but
it didn't sound so then. And the war
lasted till old Lige he was rich, and
â¢
70 years old? Considering what one
has to combat from infancy to old
age we get along surprisingly well.
We not only exist, but most of us live
happily, establish our homes and rear
our families in peace and usually have
enough to eat, drink and wear. The
constant marvel to me is that in view
of the size of the world's population
and the difficulty of finding standing
place more people do not starve.
It is true, moreover, that the world
is getting on faster than it used to.
Slavery has gone; foul and disgraceful
prison conditions at least in civilized
countries are abolished as well as
harsh punishment for minor crimes.
The horrors of war are mitigated by
heroic service of physicians and nurses.
Woman can gain the education which
afterward I heard him say how thank
ful he was for what the Lord had
done for him."
After a time the preacher said: "It
does not appear, then. Brother Juck
lin, that you believe in the effective
ness of prayer."
"Oh, bless your life. yes. But the
greatest good it fan do ii man is tÂ»>

"Dearest Ermyntrude!" exclaimed
her mamma.
* "She has just had a joust with the
Bishop," said Mr. Chatterley, "and I do
not think had the worst of it."
"Indeed," murmured Lady Bertram,
with â  vacant lock. "Have you no news
to give roe to-night?" She could not
for a moment suppose that Mr. Chat
terley had ventured to stop by her side
merely to praise her daughter.
"All the world is talking of young
Mr. Falconet's speech," said Mr. Chat
terley.
"Yes; he seems a considerable person.
He dined here to-day." f
"I am told he is a great admirer of
Lady Bertram," said Mr. Chatterley.
"He knows very little of me," said
the lady, trying to veil her curiosity.
"He knows what all know, and feels
what all feel, who have the honor and
delight of Lady Bertram's acquaintance
â only what we feel or know goes for
nothing â we, alas: who are not orators
or poets and statesmen."
"What did he say?" said Lady Ber
tram, in a hushed voice.
But before he could answer he was
obliged to retire, for a young man
quickly and unceremoniously approach- â¢
ed and addressed Lady Bertram.
He was handsome â the highest order
of English beauty, the Norman tem
pered by the Saxon; nis complexion
bright;' his dark blue eye delicately
Arched, regular features, the upper lip
ishort. and with hyacinthine locks of
auburn hair.
"I thought I was not to see you to
night. Gaston," Baid the lady of the
house.
"Well, I do not know whether I ought
to be here. I have not been exactly cut
by some of your friends, but they were
rather queer. I suppose being in my
father's house they could scarcely re
frain from noticing me."
"I have made the acquaintance of
your successor." murmured Lady Ber
tram. "He dined here. I have had
much conversation with him."
'Ah:" said Lord Gaston. "Then I
suppose you are in an orthodox mood."
"The English are . essentially a reli
gious people," said Lady Bertram.
, "You did not think so the last time
: we talked about these matters."
"1 think I might now sit down," said
Lady Bertram, as if his words had not
reached her; and she took his arm even
before It could be offered, j and they
were soon seated on a sofa.
"This Mr. Falconet Is an extraordi
nary man," said Lady Bertram. "I
never knew any one bo eloquent.' He
talks, of course, too much, but that will
wear off. lam sorry now that you left
Parliament." . â *. *
"I am â¢ not. Parliaments are worn
out."
"But you say that of everything,"
said Lady Bertram.
"And it is true of everything; but of
the whole affair nothing is so exhaust
ed as the human race Itself."
"But what, then, Is to happen?" in
quired Lady Bertram. J&
"Many things may happen. I do not
suppose that because is worn out
even this little planet /which we call
ours has not yet some f#ttunÂ£>.The mis
take which our self-conVeit has always
made has been to .suppose" i that this
planet was made for ;m There never
was any foundation \ such a belief
and now we know It is mere folly. The
fact Is that man has really never very
much taken to this globe. And no won
der. It clearly was uevar intended for
him. It consists of more water than
land, and of that land a great portion
is inhabitable desert. Look at the
miserable amount of population that,
after millions of years, he has just con
trived to procreate! Scarcely equal to
the spawn of a shoal of herrings."
"Then you think the world was made
for herrings?" sweetly whispered Lady
Bertram.
"I cannot tell what it was made for,
but I think I can tell what It was not
made for."
"Then you have no interest in life?"
/â¢ "Yes; 1 have in you."
"If you begin talking nonsense I will
go and fetch my lord."
"I suppose It Is only Mr. Falconet who
may talk nonsense."
"Mr. Falconet has none but the most
exalted ideas. His life Is devoted to the
vindication and the triumph of reli
gious truth."
i "I am also capable of devotion," said
Lord Gaston, "and that 1 is to the hap
piness of my species. "â For that reason I
wish it to become extinct."
Two young ladies with very long
trains bowed to Lady Bertram from a
distance and kissed their hands. "I
must cay a word to them," she said,
as she returned their salute. "You do
not mind?"
"No; I like them bo\h. They have
more sense than half the girls I know."
The ladies approached. "I was so
sorry, Lady Bertram," said one of
them, "not to meet Professor O'Galaxy
here to-night. We were at his lecture
to-day at the Royal, and I wanted so
much to ask him a question. I see my
way so far as protoplasm clearly, but
there I stop. I think we ought to be
satisfied, but Blanche de Grey says no;
that will not satisfy her; she must go
further."
"If Lady Blanche goes further she
will not get rid of her difficulties," said
Lord Gaston.
CHAPTER V.
Though in the formation of our char
acter the influence of individuals can
not be doubted or denied, nevertheless
there are some persons born with a pre
disposition so strong that it is difficult
to believe that, under any circum
stances, that native vein would not
have asserted itself. Lord Gaston was
of this kind and class. Even as a child
he was Inquisitive, skeptical and eccen
tric, doing things which were forbid
den, or, if too original to have been
contemplated, anticipated by the cen
sure of others, when done, disapproved.
He had the awkward habit of asking
questions which could be easily an
swered and expressing opinions which
perplexed and sometimes shocked. Nev
ertheless he was a favorite, and at first
universally bo, and this was owing to
two causes â his good looks and his good
temper. Nothing could disturb the last
and his first glance fascinated. Still, it
â was a lamentable f|ct that, In the long
run, he could not, as the phrase goes,
"get on" with anybody. At a great
public school he was idolized, but it
ended by the authorities privately com
municating with his father that they
thought, on the whole, it would be ad
vantageous that his son should be
withdrawn from their control. Not that
he ever did anything disgraceful, mean
or Ignominious, or even committed vio
lent or rebellious acts, but he was in
the habit of circulating opinions which
injuriously affected the discipline of the
school, was in the habit of reading and
advising others to read books which,
while affecting to be philosophical,
could not for a moment be tolerated, as
tending, in the opinion of the masters,
to the destruction of morals and reli
gion. What, however, brought affairs

to a crisis was a motion which he made"
in the boys' debating society condemn
ing the system of public education. Had
he not been the son of a great noble,
who himself in his day had been one of
the bright ornaments of their institu
tion, he would probably have been ex
pelled, but as it was he surrendered
and marched out with all the honors of
war.
Lord Bertram was 6uch a complete
man of the world that he resolved
never to quarrel with his son, and he
endeavored by indirect means to guide
him in the right path and counteract
these evil tendencies. He thought Ox
ford would remove them, and he sent
him there at an unusually early age.
But the Oxford of Gaston was no longer
the Oxford of his father, and Lord Ber
tram, who had many things to think
about, was not sufficiently aware of
this. A spirit almost as inquisitive as
that which influenced the son had be
gun to pervade the great university,
and it unfortunately happened that the
head of the house of which Gaston had
become a member was one of those dis
tinguished divines who do not believe
in divinity. Of this Socrates he soon
became the favorite pupil, and, consid
orlng his rank, his fine looks, his fine
temper and the reputation for talents
which was soon circulated about and
easily and eagerly accepted. Oxford
camar^o believe that it cherished in its
bosom one who in due season would be
come its most brilliant ornament and
its shining light.
Nevertheless, when he had exhausted
all the nebulous Interpretations of his
master, which would rove that things,
though entirely profane, were yet es
sentially sacred, Gaston engaged in a
controversy on the origin of evil, which
terminated by his somewhat abruptly
quitting his alma mater and informing
his father that he should not return to
Oxford, which he looked upon as a nest
of sacedotal hypocrisy.
This was a great disappointment to
Lord Bertram, who, however, was a
man never without a resource, and
Lord Gaston was soon gazetted as an
attacl c to one of our most important
embassies. This seemed a successful
arrangement Nobody could be more
popular than Lord Gaston In his new
world. All the great ladles were en
chanted with him and invited him to
their tea parties. He vas called the
handsome Englishman, and then he
THE SAN FRANCISCO SUNDAY CALL.
was so kind and obliging, too. He was
as good-natured as he was beautiful.
Apparently he was well pleased with
his new life. Two years passed away
and he never asked for leave of ab
sence, though he wrote charming let
ters to his father, who read extracts
from them sometimes to his colleagues,
and sent the most exquisite presents to
Claribel, whom he called mamma. Un
happily, one morning he appeared
without notice at Bertram House and
ordered breakfast as calmly as if he
â¢ever had left his home. He had tray-
eled day and night, for he had been
ordered by the Government of the
country to leave it at an hour's notice,
some correspondence having been dis
covered between the noble British at
tache and a revolutionary leader. A
secret communication was made to
Lord Bertram, but it too was the in
terest of all parties that the affair
should be hushed up.
"There is nothing to be done for him
now but to push him into Parliament,"
said his father. "If anything can get
the nonsense out of a man it is the
House of Commons."
The reader will have seen that this
last expedient had not been quite suc
ca^sful. Lord Bertram forgot his an
noyance in the pressure of public busi
ness, and Lady Bertram found a sub
stitute for the skeptical confidence and
revolutionary principles of her step
son, with which she was beginning to
sympathize in the unflinching ortho
doxy and ultra-Conservatism of his
parliamentary successor, urged as they
were by him with irresistible dialectics
and a torrent of words which no lmpro
visatore could excel, and to which Lady
Bertram in veiled ecstasy listened as
she would to a cataract in the Alps.
On a certain day in every week it
came to be understood that Mr. Joseph
Toplady Falconet would probably be
drinking a cup of tea at Bertram House
and expounding his scheme of regener
ation for a society which he was re
solved to save, though he admitted its
condition was somewhat desperate. He
had already achieved success in the
House of Commons, where rapid suc
cess is difficult. Very shortly after his
entrance into that still fastidious and
somewhat incredulous assembly he took
up the Sabbatarian question, and the
--notice of his motion was received with
contemptuous respect. But the feeling
was far otherwise when. they had lis
tened to him. The old hands at once
recognized that this was a man who
would mount, and looked forward with
interest to the occasion when he might
deliver himself of some practical sub
ject, and not on such moonshine as
that with which he had favored them.
But here the old hands, as they often
do, made a mistake. There was a
great, though latent, fund of religion
ism in the House; much of It sincere.
a large portion no doubt inspired by
the constituencies, but the members
who acknowledged these sentiments
were, generally speaking, not of a class
calculated to enthral listening Senates.
They were respectable men. usually
opulent, and their opinions on matters
of trade and taxation always com
manded deference, but they were quite
incapable of grappling with the great
questions that touch the convictions'
and consciences of nations, and they
hailed with satisfaction a commanding
expounder of opinions which in their
hands they felt would have assumed a
character of feebleness which they
were persuaded was undeserved. These
men, sitting on both sides of the House,
rallied around Falconet. He gathered
other allies. With all his abilities and
acquirements, Joseph Toplady Fal
conet was essentially a prig, and among
prigs there is a freemasonry which
never fails. All the prigs spoke of him
as of the coming man.
Lady Bertram always returned from
her daily drive at 5 o'clock, and she
was always at home. There never had
been formal invitations, but the ini
tiated came â a small, refined circle.
There were always a few ladies of great
fashion, sometimes a royal Duchess, an
Embassador, a dandy or nyo â for Lady
Bertram could even command dandies
â and half a dozen other men, native or
foreign, but of European celebrity.
When it was in his power, Falconet
was there, but that was uncertain, for
the House of Commons is a jealous mis
tress and will not grant success with
out due attention. The greatest compli
ment you can pay to a woman is to
give to her your time, and it is the same
with our Senate. A man who is always
in his place becomes a sort of favorite.
But there were other means of com
munication between Clarlbel and her
new prophet; books were mutually lent
td eafch other, and every day there were
letters exchanged; on her part, little
emblazoned notes; on his, treatises,
pamphlets, where everything was di
vided under heads i and every question
exhausted and settled.
CHAPTER VI.
The clubs, which in their fanciful in
vention are only inferior to the Arabian
XighU' Entertainments, speculated
much on the future of the Lady Er
myntrude. Some thought her so ma
tured in her mind and manner that she
would marry immediately; others, on
the contrary, held that she would hesi
tate for a long time before she decided;
a third party ventured on an opinion
that she would probably never marry
at all.
The names of some persons, however,
were already intimated as the possible,
or even probable, partners of her life
and fortune. Qaston, from his con
nection with the lady, was always the
first mentioned, and yet his name was
almost Invariably dismissed as that of
a man who had no thought of marriage.
Then there was Lord Fitz-Alb. He was
supposed to have a very good chance,
being the great favorite of the Bishop,
and quite tit, though youthful, to be a
prelate himself. The Bishop was one
of Lady Ermyntrude's guardians, who.
it was understood, consulted him on all
occasions. Some thought that Hugo
Bohun would be the lucky man. Heir
esses, somehow or oth|r, always seemed
to like him, though somehow or other
eventually they had hitherto never
united their fate with his. Hugo
Bohun was an ostentatious pauper, and
had a theory that rich women liked to
marry paupers, particularly if they
were personages so comme il faut as
himself. The knowing ones, on the
whole, backed Lord Warrener against
the field. It was circulated that Lady
Ermyntrude in one of her morning rides
had more than once inquired whether
Lord Warrener was in the park, and
seemed disappointed he was not at her
side.
Lord Warrener was a good-looking,
accomplished cosmopolitan. H- aten
tatiously announced, though of arapla
estate, that he cared for nothing but
money, but it was generally held that
he would prefer obtaining It by a race
or a rubber rather than by the aid of
an heiress, however wealthy or dis
tinguished.
There was a ball, and the Lady
Ermyntrude had danced twice with
Hugo Bohun; he had even attended, h. r
to the tea room.
"This is one of the happiest nights
of my life," he said to her. "Po y .
know, I think it wonderfully kind .'
you to dance with such a miserab. -
wretch as I am."
"One meets with so many happy peo
ple," said the Lady Ermyntrude. "I
rather like sometimes to meet a miser
able wretch."
"What other miserable wretch do you
know except myself?" asked Hugo.
"I know several wretches,"' replied
the lady, " but I am not at all sure
they are miserable wretches."
"Well, what is your idea of a
wretch "'
"I think a man who is discontented
with his lot in life is a wretch."
"Everybody is discontented with their
lot In life!"
"I thought just now you said you
were most happy?"
"So I am when I am with you."
"Then, after all. you are not a rÂ°al
wretch," said the lady.
"Do you think Gaston is?" inquired
Hu~o.
"His wretchedness is on so great a
scale that it amounts to the sublime.
"I should think you were contented
with your lot in life," said Hugo.
"I have not yet considered that ques
tion so deeply as it deserves," said
Lady Ermyntrude. "At present my
thoughts are limited to these walls and
to the cotillon which Z am now coin*
to dance."
"Alas! not with me!"
"No." said Lady Ermyntrnds. with
drawing her arm and taking tnat of
Lord Warrener, who at that moment
joined her, and bowed.
"Now I feel this Is the most mlstrabla
night of my life." murmured Hugo.
The lady, departing, looked over her
shoulder and smiled.
CHAPTER VIL
One of the most Important neighbors
of Mr. Falconet died about this time.
He was a German gentleman and
lived at Lavender Hill in a mansion
situated In unusually ample grounds
for a villa residence and accroached
through lodges and by roads Ingeni
ously winding. Mr. Hartmann was a
bachelor; the Qrm a distinguished one
â Hartmann Brothers. They were
bankers to more than one European
potentate, and whenever any member
of the royal or imperial families paid
a visit to England they spared one day
to be entertained at Lavender Hill with
much magnificence; banquets and balls
in colossal tents, and all the bowers
and groves of Lavender resonant with
musicians and illumined with many
lamps of many colors.
It was understood that Mr. Hartmann
had dted very weathy. and that the
bulk of his targe fortune had been be
queathed to his brother, who resided
in a foreign capital. It was still more
interesting news when it began to be
rather authoritatively rumored that in
future England was to be the residence
of the heir, and not only England, but
Lavender Hill.
In due time architects and builders
and workmen arrived at the spot, and
it was said that great alterations were
making there, with that disregard fur
expense which became the proprietor of
means so ample. Among other changes
It was said that a library haw arrived
from Germany, rich and rare, and
which was to be housed in a new
chamber becoming such treasures.
Mr. Falconet had great respect for
the house of Hartmann Brothers, and
took the earliest opportunity of per
sonally paying his respects to the new
comer. His arrival among them was
rendered not less interesting by the cir
cumstance of his not being a bachelor.
He was a widower, but with an onlyBY THE LATE BENJAMIN DISRAELI
child, a daughter still in v her teens, yet
already. it was understood, recognized
as the head of his establishment. The
arrival of the Hartmann therefore:,
created no little excitement in the Fal
conet family, both among the sons and
the daughters. Especially was there no
lack of speculation as to the character
and appearance of Miss Hartmann.
The first visit was made and re
turned, and the first impression of their
new neighbors on the Falconet family
was highly favorable. Mr. Hartmann
was a man singularly calm, with an in
tellectual countenance, reserved, a little
shy perhaps, but not dull. As for his
daughter Angela, all the young ladies
fell immediately in love with her. and
after having walked twice round their
own grounds with her were quite pre
pared to vow eternal friendship. Their
brothers were less vehement, restrained
X>erhaps by their engagements to their
sisters* coadjutors in the Bible class,
but their glance betrayed their appre
ciation of the charms and manner of
their new acquaintance.
â¢Xot that Angela Hartmann was an
ideal beautyâ a Phryne to be painted
by Appelles or modelel by Praxiteles,
or a Titian's Flora, or even a Madonna
of Raffaello; but there were a sweet
ness In her voice and a softness in her
demeanor which at once attracted,
while, though the habitual expression
of her mild cheek and penciled brow
was grave, it was at the same time not
rigorous, but sympathetic Neverthe
less, as time flowed on the enthusiasm
of the Falconet family in her behalf,
and especially of Its female, portion,
abated. They embraced her when they
met. but they did not meet very often;
they still much talked of her when she
was not present, but amid varying
comments and criticism there seemed
a general agreement that they could
not quite make her out. She had sweet
ly declined to assist them in tlÂ»elr Bible
classes, and had softly refused to teach
at their Sunday schools. She was not
uninterested in hymnology. but her
songs of adoration were different from
those in their orthodox collection. Miss
Hartmann regularly attended divine
service at their parish church, but un
fortunately she was never accompanied
by her father. This greatly disquieted
Mrs. Falconet, who at first wished Mr.
Falconet to speak to him, and eventu
ally did send him a sheaf of tracts. Mr.
Falconet, however, though as devout
as his better half, was still, to a certain
degree, a man of the world, which truly
every merchant must be. and he inti
mated to his wife that Mr. Hartmann
was probably a German philosopher, a
difficult kind of animal in these matters
to deal with. "He was showing to me
his library the other day," said Mr.
Falconet, "and there were two portraits
In It, very fine pictures â one was of
Spinoza, the other of Kant."
"Good gracious!" exclaimed Mn.
Falconet.
"You need not be too much alarmed.

"Yes." he replied, "I owe them much;
they did their work In their time, and
I an grateful to them, but I have long
ceased to share thlr opinions."
"I feel greatly relieved," said Mrs.
Falconet.
CHAPTER VIII.
It mmm a bank holiday, and Mr. Hart
manlPwas absorbed In a new work of
a friend of Schopenhauer, which had
Just arrived, when a visitor was an
nounced. He looked at the card which
his servant brought in to him, and the
spleen which, for a moment, was ex
cited at being dis
turbed vanished In
stantly as he
glanced at the su
perscription. So the
servant was or
dered to usher In
the guest. and
there entered the
room the same gen
tleman who had
behaved kindly at
the beginning of
this history to the
Indian who landed
on a Sunday at the
port of London.

tsaid the guest, "a
pleasant quarter."
"I might have

Hartmann, "but I

a weakness here to
close my life."

"The local influences are the strong
est." said his companion. "It is almost
vain to struggle against them, though
they are exceedingly mischievous. I
see you have â -'a new book. He has
also sent me a copy."
"I do not know that there is any
thing new in it," replied Mr. Hart
mann, "but what is old to us is new
*to the world. He is one of the few men
who can write on an abstruse subject
with clearness."
"They never really answer him," said
the visitor.
"Bo they call him a visionary," 6aid
Mr. Hartmann.
"A visionary!" exclaimed his friend.
"So are you a visionary; so am I; bo
was Mahomet; so was Columbus. If
anything is to be really done in this
world, It must be done by visionaries;
men who see the future, and make the
future because they Bee it. What I
really feared about him was that he
had the weakness of believing in poll
tics, of supposing that the pessimism
of the universe could be changed or
even modified by human arrange
ments."
"I heard he was a Communist."
"He might as well be a Liberal or a
Conservativeâ mere jargon; different
names for the same thing. You and I
know that in attempting to terminate
the misery of man, there is only one
principle to recognize, and that is the
destruction of the species. You and I
hold the same tenets, and we desire the
same end. We differ only in our esti
mate as to the time required; but that
Is of no import. You think that cen
turies must elapse before the consum
mation. I would fain believe our re
lease and redemption were nearer; but
you are a seaentary man, a man of
books. Action and some Instinct have
taught me what you have derived from
pondering on your own observations
and the thoughts of others. All that is
happening in the world appears to me
to indicate a speedier catastrophe.
These immense armies, these new-fan
gled armaments â what do they mean?
In the Thirty Years' War they would
have depopulated Europe. What com
missariat can support these hosts? I
trust more to the disease and famine
of campaigns than to the slaughter
of battles."
"Remember what Conde said when he
lost his best troops," remarked Mr.
Hartmann. "One night at Paris will
supply their place."
"Ah! but a night at Paris is different
now from what it was In the days of
the Condes. The French are the most
civilized pation and the most sterile."
"But, reverting to what I was saying,
there are indications of habitual dearth
in this globe which are encouraging."
"Surely these are comparatively slight
means to achieve such a result as the
total destruction of the human species."
"Not so slight as you may imagine.
Besides, we must accept all means.
Destruction In every form must be wel

corned. If It be only the destruction of
a class it is a step in the right direc
tion. Society is formed of classes, and
it may be necessary to destroy it in
detail."
"What I fear will be the sreat ob
stacle to accomplishing our end," said
Hartmann, "to which, as you really
know, I am not less devoted than your
self, ia the religion of Europe, and
which nas unhappily been colonially
Introduced into America."
"It has many assailants," said his
companion.
"And in its time it has defeated many
assailants," replied Hartmann. "I
doubt whether my neological country
men will be more fortunate and effect
ive than the French encyclopedists."
"Ah, but you do not sufficiently allow
for the influence of science at the pres
ent day."
"Query, whether science was less in
fluential at the end of the eighteenth
century than at the present moment.
D'Alembert, and Diderot, and Hoi bach
(? Lamarque) were no mean authorities,
and as for mathematics, the French
were always supreme. No, the more I
ponder over this religious question, the
more I am convinced that we ehall
never succeed in our mighty aim unless
we contrive to enlist some religious
faith in our resources. If it be true
that the confidence of Europe and her
colonies in their creeds is falling away,
cannot our principle of extermination
be clothed in a celestial form?"
"Secure the future by destroying the
present," said his companion musingly.
"You know I have always had
some views of this character," said Mr.
Hartmann, "but they are fresh in my
mind at this moment from some con
versations I have recently had with an
Indian gentleman, who has been visit
ing In this neighborhood, and whom I
met at a house certainly not renowned
for Its philosophy. This Indian gentle
man, a man of great culture. Is from
Ceylon. He Is a Buddhist and a self
appointed missionary of that faith,
which, if imbibed in its pure and origi
nal spirit, would consummate our pur
pose."'
"I fancy I know your friend, and
have regretted that the pressure of
affairs has prevented me from culti
vating his acquaintance. You are
speaking, I am sure, of Kuslnara. I
came over from Rotterdam with him
some little time ago; a remarkable
man."
" 'Tis the. same person," said Mr.
Hartmann. "He might give lectures.
Lectures are grains of mustard seed.
Or, what would be better, we might
give him a chapel, and let him cele
brate, at the same time that he ex
pounded his doctrine, the services of
his sect. There must be among the
Chinese about the Port of London and
other places the elements of a congre
gation. The English like a congrega
tion. The mpment there is a congre
gation they think the affair practical."
"There is no doubt," said hia' friend,
"that if we could enlist the religious
principle on our side it might produce
great effects. There is nothing to be
compared to it In power except the in
fluence of womenâ and they generally
go together. I once thought I had
gained one of the greatest ladles in
Europe to our creed; I gave, I might
say, years to the effort and traveled
thousands of miles. I should think
nothing of going to~ v the Brazils to
morrow were there a chance of enlist
ing the sympathies in our cause of
any woman of influence. In these mat
ters they are stronger than armies."
"Here comes my daughter," said Mr.
Hartmann. "She wants to give you
some luncheon. She is not one of those
women who are stronger than armies,
but she is a dear girl."
CHAPTER IX.
There was an assembly at Lady Clan
more's, a popular person, a friend of
Lothair. Lady Bertram was present
and moved about with the conscious
ness of her irresistible fascination. She
had received the homage of all the
illustrious who were present with a
mystical glance from her soft rich
eyes, and occasionally had deigned to
breathe forth a sentence worthy of a
SibyL Then, as was rather her wont,
she retired from the principal saloons
and seated herself alone on a sofa In
a chamber less frequented, meditating
on the variety of her charms and her
magical influence over mankind. Self
introspection was ever the delightful
and inexhaustible pursuit of Claribel,
and she never closed these bewitching
reveries without increased admiration
of her own idiosyncrasy.
A gentleman approached her of dis
tinguished mien. He was young, but
of matured youth; his fine countenance
ierene. but commanding. His costume,
though simple, was effective, and,
though he wore no ribbon, he was
decorated by a star in brilliants.
"Lady Bertram." he said, "I am
commanded by Lady Clanmorne to at
tend you to the tea-room, where you
will find Lady Clanmore, who particu
larly wishes to see you."
Claribel a little lost her presence of
mind. She did not know the envoy of
her friend, and yet she ought to know
everybody who was anybody. And this,
too, a stranger so distinguished! He
seemed made to appreciate her. She
was always contemplating her irresist
ible influence over him, though certain
ly before she commenced her mystic
charms she would have liked to have
known exactly who he was. But aspir
ing control; she felt herself controlled.
She rose and with a slight bow took his
offered arm.
He gave her some tea, observing
L*dy Clanmore had not arrived, and
then, without any formal suggestion
on his part, she found herself seated,
and the stranger by her side.
'I owe Lady Clanmore much," he
said, "but am moat grateful to her for
giving me this opportunity of speaking
to Lady Bertram."
"And why should you be grateful for
that." murmured Claribel. with a
glance of voluptuous penetration.
"Because it has been the object of
my life that I might have the oppor
tunity of conversing with one of the
most gifted of women."
"The most gifted woman, I fear, car.
do little."
"She can do everything."
"There is much to be done," replied
Claribel mysteriously, but as she really
had nothing to suggest she only looked
like a high priestess bound to betray no
secrets of the initiated.
"Certainly there is much to be done,"
said the stranger. "Society is resolving
itself into its original elements. Us
superficial order is the result of habit,
not of conviction. Everything Is chang
ing, and changing rapidly. Creeds dis
appear in a night. As for political in
stitutions, they are all challenged, and
statesmen, conscious ot what is at
hand, are changing nations Into
armies."
"What you say is true." said Lady
Bertram moodily; and then she added
with a subtle, knowing look, and in a
tadenced whisper, "but ia it the whole
tru:h ."'
'Those who know the whole truth
are the lords of the world," said the
stranger, "and it Is because I feel that
I am perhaps speaking to one of such
sovereigns that I hail this night, which
has given me the advantage of liaten
ing to her counsels."
"We must think," said Lady Bert
ram.
"Pardon me, madam, but I am mis
taken, if you have not exhausted
thought. There, are thinkers, I know
many, not unequal to the times in
which we move, but they are all uf
opinion that what we require now ia
not so much further thought as a trans
cendent type of that thought alike to
guide and inspire us. "
Claribel unfurled' her fan and grace
fully waved it. There was a gentle
tumult in her frame which indicated an
increased action of the h-art, her cheÂ«k
slightly glowed. It was delicioua to
hear, and, as she could not refrain from
believing, from high authority, that
her mission was to guide and inspire.
She had been trying to do this all her
life, hut, not knowing the way, she had
found it difficult to direct what path to
follow, and Instead of inspiring others
she generally Imbibed the last Ideas
which were infused into her. Now it
was absolutely necessary to say some
thing, and so she said in a tone of
mystical decision. "It ia impossible to
resist ones destiny. "
"Impossible â and yours la a com-
manding one."
"You were speaking of your friends
and some peculiar views of theirs?"
remarked Lady Bertram, vanity and
curiosity combining in an effort to dis
cover who were these unknown ad
mirers of her consummate self.
"Their views are peculiar only be
cause they are conscious, and have
long been conscious, that the pretended
principles upon wKleh society is formed
have ceased to exist, and that they are
merely conventional phrases which, for
the moment, are convenient to employ."
"We must resist conventionalism,'
observed Lady Bertram with much au
thority.
"These are good tiding from such
lips," said the stranger. "It will give
courage to those who would extricate
us from the blunders of. ages."
At this moment, smiling, yet with an
air of curiosity blended with her smiles.
Lady Clanmorne entered the tea-room
and approached Claribel. Her attend
ant, murmuring that he had now ful
fllled his mission, rose, and bowing to
both ladies, left the room.
"I am most anxious to know who is
your friend. I saw you from a dis
tance on his arm." said Lady Clan
morne. "I thought he must have coma
with one of the Princes and yet I
should have remembered him had ha
been presented to me."
"He brought to me a message from
you." said Lady Bertram, amazed, "and
a rendezvous in the tea-room."
"From me! Let us follow him'"
The two great ladles returned to the
ballroom, but the stranger was not
there. They walked through the other
salons. He was not visible. Lady Clan
morne, describing her unknown guest,
made inquiries about him of the at
tendants. They agreed that he had
just quitted the house. He was for
a moment in the cloakroom, but thera
he had only figured as a number.
There was a scribe in the hall making
a catalogue of the guests. It seemed
that the stranger had avoided Riving
his name, and, as he was decorated
with a diamond star, the scribe thought
all must be right.

STORY
THE expression of tender senti
ment with which Private Jansen
regarded the tintype picture of
a young girl sat with striking in
congruity on his angular, sharp
cut face. The tall form, clad in travel
stained kahki .and covered with the ac
cumulated dust of a long and weary
march under the scorching Philippine
sun. had little in its appearance to sug
gest the lover. The set, stem, rather
harsh face of Private Jansen was that
of a man who takes life as a hard real
ity and has little opportunity to de
velop those lighter and more subtle
faculties which have to do with Cupid
and his wiles.
Unimaginative as he seemed, how
ever; practical and matter-of-fact as
tv ere his ways, there were times when
his: "bunkie" would surprise a great
tenderness In Jansen's clear blue eyes,
which redeemed his face from utter
plainnessâ the eyes which gleamed in
buttle and directed the bullets from his
rifle to the heart, of many a dusky foe
mar.; which sparkled in excitement In
many a desperate rush and locked with
boundless pity 'on the- death of many
a comrade, â¢ while the balance of his
face remained strangely immobile.
To-night, as he had' often done be-
fore, Jansen carefully removed the soil
ed paper covering from a little metallic
â¢square which had lone reposed, a cher
ished treasure, in the pocket of his
army shirt, and brought to light the
fading memento of the only passion
â which had ever broken in upon his un
eventful life.
"Keep it. Wilfredâ and bring it back
to me.' she had said as she bade him
good-by-with a sob at the little white
washed gate of her father's house in
Illinois.
What p. picture she had made that
day, as she, stood in her blue gingham
dress, the dark hair curling about her
temples and two big tears glistening
in her bright brown eyes!* For a mo
ment Wilfred's courage deserted him
and he wished that he might stay. 'But
only for a moment. He saw the proud
â  light in her eyes as she gazed upon
Ms uniform. When he kissed her, she
had murmured "My hero! 'â , Only don't
be too brave. Don't let them kill you,
but come back to me." Â«
"I will, I will, Jennie," he had an
swered brokenly, and then he had
rushed away.
And . that was over a year ago. The
war with a civilized foe was farcically
short-; For a time peace , reigned and
aoldiers dreamed of a speedy return to

PRIVATE
those they had left behind. Then re
bellion raised its hydra head and a
foe a hundred times more numei'ous
than the Spaniards opposed th^m no\*t
a foe more treacherous than the Ameâ¢
Kan Indian and more crafty. 111-armed,
unorganized, cowardly, it i.s true â an
enemy which made no stand, but which
shot from ambush; an invisible foe
that picked off sentries; that knew ev
ery point of vantage in a country
Â«?tranpe to American soldiers and con
tinually harassed them, allowing them
neither rest nor sleep. Combined with
these conditions were a torrid climate,
breeding all manlier of diseases, equip
ment that was inadequate and poor in
quality; scant and unsuitable food â
nnd little time to eat it. Small-won
der then that faces grew haggard and
forms bent; that many succumbed to
fatigue and sickness and that pain
racked bodies longed for home.
Company Aof the â th Volunteer In
fantry was among the first to occupy
Spanish soil. It had seen plenty of
active service since its arrival, shortly
before the Spanish surrender, and held
a record for efficient work. Captain
Bpe&ecr, the company commander, had
seen service in the Civil War, though
his efforts were then directed against
the flag he now supported. The first
lieutenant of Company A had fleshed
his sword in numerous Indian cam
paigns. He was a small but well-built
man, scarcely reaching the army stand
ard for height, but all nerve and mus
cle, inured to every hardship and pre
eminently the- right man in the right
placeâ which, unfortunately, could be
said of few other volunteer officers then
In the islands. Such was Lieutenant
Forrest, commanding the detachment
of thirty men on a scouting expedition,
of which Wilfred Jansen was one.
The night was dark, almost to opa
city; its stillness broken only by the
monotonous tramp, tramp, tramp of the
sentry on his beat. "Tapfe" was sound
ing and most of the tired men were al
ready asleep as Jansen carefully re
wrapped his talisman and returned it
to its place. He pulled the light blank
et over his head to keep off the swarms
of insect* and began to speculate on
the probability of a speedy return to
"God's country," as the soldiers termed
the States, in uncomplimentary com
parison with our new and somewhat
dearly acquired possessions in * the
Orient. Some day American merchants
would reap a rich harvest of trade
from these islands, and American en
terprise would build up great indus
tries, found populous cities and weave a
mesh of iron rails throughout the
Philippines, as it had done on the hunt-
LOUIS J. STELLMAN
Ing grounds of the red man. But mean
time the soldiers were perishing from
disease and fatigue and were being
Bhot down by invisible foes; they were
homesick and weary and not in a prop
er frame of mind to philosophize upon
the manifold blessings that would ac
crue in the future to those who stayed
at home.
Something of all this passed through
Jansen's mind and he vaguely wonder
ed if the game was worth the candle,
when a shot and a cry, followed by a
sharp command, brought every man to
his feet, with the promptness born of
constant expectation of attack.
The shot had been fired by the sen
try at a black figure, with upraised
"bolo" â just in time to save the for
mer's head from being: cleft In twain.
The Tagal was now writhing on the
ground, a bullet In his breast. He had
stolen up, noiselessly, in the shadows
to dispose of the sentry, so that his
comrades might comfortably massacre
this little 6quad while they slept â and
ho wo"uld have accomplished his pur
pose, as many had done before him,
had he not chanced to step upon the
tin cover of a beef can which emitted
a warning "clack" and apprised the
sentry of his danger.
Lieutenant Forrest, whose experi
ence in the Apache country had taught
him that every camping place in hos
tile territory must be a redoubt, had
chosen, in the present instance, a sort
of natural stockade, formed by a
hedge of stunted trees and a huge
boulder or ledge of rock. The trees,
seven jor eight in number â their
gnarled and twisted branches inter
laced in a wonderftll fretwork â were

A WHIRL ASUNDER
By GERTRUDE ATHERTON
THE SAX FRANCISCO SUNDAY CALL.
The prizr story for this week, "Wil
fred Jnnsen, Private," is from the pen
of Louis J. Stellman of Los Angeles,
and represents the first prize win
ning story to come from the south
land. It is a cleverly told Philippine
story, dealing with an episode during
the guerrilla warfare against tbe wily

feet breastwork, rising to an average
height of four and a half feet and was
plevced here and there with narrow
apertures which seemed to have been
especially designed by Nature for use
as port-holes. These two ramparts
extended at right angles for a distance
of about forty feet, while behind lay a
comparatively open country. In front,
about two hundred yards beyond the
point t>f the "L" shaped fortification
was the entrance to a tropical forest,
in which the foe lay concealed.
At this moment the moon, which un
til now had been hidden by a cloud,
emerged from behind its vapory screen
and cast a vivid light upon the scene.
Thirty sturdy figures, each grasping a
Springfield, were gathered together
in a silent group â haggard and un
kempt, with the half-dazed expression
of men suddenly awakened from sleep
âbut all ready to meet danger, intelli
gently and unflinchingly, from what
ever quarter It might come. There
were two upon whose sleeves one
might dimly discern the soiled white
chevrons of corporal and sergeant, re
spectively. Another, whose costume
gave little sign of superior rank, but
whose sword and bearing Indicated his
commission, stood a little apart. Lieu
tenant Forrest, his right hand grasp
ing a Colt's revolver and his left shad
ing his eyes, peered intently toward
the wood, whose foliaged labyrinths the
moon's rays failed to Illumine. All.
seemed still enough. But suddenly the
report of a rifle sounded* The lieuten
ant's helmet was pierced by a Mauser
bullet, which glanced on the ledge be
hind him and spent its )force with a
metallic "pang" on a canteen lying
near.
"That was close." said Forrest, ex
amining his perforated headpiece.
"Keep down, men." he commanded,
â¢
quickly, as others would have risen at
his side. "That nigger was ud a tree.
A little lower and he'd have potted
me."
"We can't tell how many there are
till they come out," he mused. And
then, to the men: "Don't shoot till
you see your target, and then shoot
straight."
â "They don't generally go about in
great force," said Sergeant â¢ Baxter,
saluting. "But I reckon there's a hun
dred or more over there. If we can
only keep them away till the captain
comes we're all right â but I doubt it.*
Lieutenant Forrest stroked his chin,
meditatively.' "It's a bad business. "
he said, after a short pause. 'They
can see us and we can't see thorn."
"Sergeant Baxter," he cried, "you
and Jansen and Maloney are the best
shots. Each of you select a loophole
and be ready. Wilson and Gregg will
hold up decoys to draw their fire.
When they shoot, you must aim by
the flashes from their guns. Three of
us. under cover of the confusion, will
make a rush for food and canteens.
It depends on your marksmanship
whether we get back alive. Adams
and Black will go with me. Ready,
now."
Two army capes, hung upon rifle
ends and topped by campaign hats,
rose slowly and with apparent cau
tion; one above the hedge |md another
above the bowlder ramparts.
"Cr-r-rack" went three Mausers, al
most in one report, followed by three
spits of flame in instantaneous response
from the loopholes. Two simultaneous
shrieks of agony sounded from the
forest and two bodies ricochetted
through the branches to the ground.
"You missed one." shouted Forrest.
"Shoot againâ all three of you, at the
place where you saw the last flash."
Before his command was completed the
Springflelds apoka aj?ain. Once more
a. Tagal death-cry rang out as another
body fell; and three men rushed to the
center of the stockade, each gathering
up an armful of food supplies and a
canteen, which they conveyed to a
place of safety.
"Good work," said th* lieutenant,
complacently. "Now we're fixed for
a little while. They can't pick us off
at their pleasure and they are too
cowardly to try it hand to hand."
He twisted his mustache, thinking
deeply. "We can't get away, either."
he went on, finally, in a less cheerful
tone. "There'll be more of them
coming, and the first dark night
they'll get us like rats in a trap. Cap
tain Spencer has eighty men. but he
may not come this way at all. We
were to meet him fifty miles below."
For a moment he was silent. Then
he picked up the perforated helmet.
"It's a bad business." he said again,
looking gloomily at the bullet-holes.
"Lieutenant-^" whispered a voice at
his elbow, so suddenly that it startled
him. 'Lieutenant:" He gazed Into
the steady blue eyes of Private Jan
sen. slightly irritated by the sudden
interruption of his thoughts.
Jansen noted this and saluted. HÂ»
crouched in silence beside his supe
rior awaiting the latter's permission
to proceed.
"Well?" inquired Forrest. more
kindly â for he respected the lanky
warrior â "What is it, Jansen"'
The latter sainted again before he
spoke and seemed embarrassed. "I'd
like to try it. sir, if you will let me."
he said softly. And the lieutenant
knew tfiat Jansen had guessed his
thought.
"The moon will co behind a cloud
in a little while," urged Jansen, "and
there's a fighting chance if I can reach
the cap'n in time; we'll fool the "goo
ajoos' yet. It's ten to one they'll get
us in a day or two, unless we're re
inforced. "
Porrest. in direct defiance to West
Point principles and army etiquette,
gripped the hand of the private. It
was a mute but eloquent expression
of esteem that words could not ex
press, and Jansen understood and
valued it accordingly.
"It's the only wayâor I wouldn't let
you risk it," said Forrest, with a catch
In his voice. "You haven't even a
fighting chance âyou know that as well
as I. But there's a bare possibility, an
almost impossible hope âjust one in a
thousand, mind you âthat you can net
through alive. You've seen how those
fellows shoot. Darkness is all that will
save you. Wrap the cape around yuu;
take off your side arms: they're too
heavy; here's my revolver. I can use
your gun. Watch your chance âand
go." Again he pressed Jansen's Dalm
and turning hastily made his way to
the other end of the bowlder.
Jansen threw the capt- about his
shoulders, placed the revolver in his
pocket and made his way to Grejcjs's
side. Gregg was his "bunkie" and Irom
the same town âwhere Jennie was
awaiting his return. Jansen tapDed
softly on th* other's shoulder and
pointed upward to where a small,
â¢wiftly moving cloud was Just touch
ing the lower edge of the moon.
"I'm going, John," he said, handing
himlThe tintype. "If I dent come back
yotr give her thiÂ» âand tell her âyou
know." Before the other could reDly
he had made his way to the farther end
of the stockade. There he crouched,
motionless, until the cloud had entirely
obscured the moon. Then, breathing a
muttered prayer as he wen', Jansen
sprang forward into the dark.iess. striv
ing to keep the trail which he knew
wouM lead him in the desired direc
tion.
It was as if some giant hand had
quickly drawn an opaque shade across
the great nocturnal lantern of the sky
and left the world to flounder In an
inky void. Jansen knew that he was
headed uright and that the country be
fore him was open. So he pluneed
ahead. But he could see nothing ânot
even the ground upon which he trod.
He fought down the terrible stifling
remonstrance of the mind to hurl it
self against black nothingness, the
sensation every one has felt when grop
ing in absolute darkness. "If it .only
lasts âif it only lasts," he kept aafoeat
ii.gr to himself. For. upon thewnall.
swiftly-moving mass of vapor tn the
sky there hung his safety; his life ââ 
and that of twenty-nine comrades in
the beleaguered stockade. If the cloud
passed too quickly, he would be seen.
There were more Tagal sharpshooters,
doubtless, in the trees. They had
Mauser rifles and had already given
evidence of the fact that they could
shoot infernally straight. He look "1
up, where the moon had been and
where a moment before there was
naught but blackness. He thought h<*
could detect, or rather sense âit was
so slight âa little haze of light. A few
rods farther he looked again. Yes, it
was plainer, now âthat fatal lumin
ance. The cloud was passing and the
light would soon break fonth. It had
all happened in lew than a minute a
time âthough it seemed an hour to
the man who was speeding away from
lurking death, into the night. The
forest was scarce four hundred yards
behind as the first ray of returning
moonlight fell athwart Jansen's path.
He was running, now. with all his
might and main. Caution was a
secondary consideration. In that open
country, devoid of any cover, a mov
ing object would be plainly discernible.
The farther away he srot the more
chance of bullets carrying wide. Jan
sen did not expect pursuit. T;i?als are
,rot brave, and. to follow him, the
natives would have to pass the little
fortress, wherein men wined, eagerly,
for the sisht of a dusky form, with
rifles whose accuracy had already
been demonstrated. It would, more
over, be easier âfar easier âto pick off

"Silk underwear," I can hear
Miss Ordir.ary-walk-ln-life say,
"as though 1 could afford silk stock

< xpensiv* for me."
It's perfectly true they do cost a
pretty penny, but it's also perfectly
true that they wear a long time. Dou
ble the time of cheap cotton and thin
lisle, so where does the economy come
in? Fa.se economy, by the way, is
something that is being indulged in
e%-ery day and by people who ought
to know whether the purchase is a
good investment or not. The tailor

gets baggy at the knees and elbows

and the material frays and acts badly
generally, but it is more economical
to buy it than the $35 suit, which is
'more than I can afford to pay," even
though it wears, a year and looks well
all the time.
Yes, Miss Skeptical will undoubtedly
Bay, "Well, you have a new suit any
how, and ain't yet tired of It, either."
That is true and it does very nicely
if you are not overly particular about
your appearance, but if you are you
are sure to come to' grief.
Wearing cheap lisle is for the world
and all like a buyer I saw in a shop
a few days ago. She wanted an or
gandy and felt rather abused because
the saleslady asked her the exorbitant
cum of 515 for a dainty little lace trim
med fluff that came in late in the fall.
With the exception of the sleeves,
which, by the way, the firm agreed to
shorten, the frock was perfect. Fifteen
dollars for an organdy. No. indeed!
It was far too expensive, and out she
Tripped to purchase the material and
take it to her dressmaker.
Now, fancy. See how her economical
streak benefited her. Flowered or
gandy costs not less than 50 cents a
yard, and I doubt if one could pur
chase It for that. Sixteen yards means
it alone. The lining and trimming
run up In an astounding fashion and
all dressmakers charge as much and
many more to fashion a thin evening
gown than a silk street frock. Even
at best, say she hired a woman at
II 5u a day, and heaven alone knows
\\ here she could find such a treasure
at that these days. Even then, I say,
her frock would cost her not less than
$20 and ell the fuss and fume of hav
ing it cut and eewed and put together
!n her own home. And then, ten to
one, it would not have the same style
nor make the swagger appearance that
the shop gown would.
Such is exactly the economy of buy
ing and wearing cheap underwear. It
not only costs more in the long run in
actual money, but one never has the
tame amount of satisfaction from It,
for there is no use talking, every man,
woman and child likes to feel well
clothed. There is a subtle something
thgt makes the head go an inch or so
higher and that gives a serene feeling
that is mighty comfortable to possess.
Old, shabby clothes have the happy
faculty of making us feel like the
ecum of the earth, and when we feel
that way we never miss the oppor
tunity to look the part, and look It
v.itha vengeance, too.

a man with a Mauser, from the pro
tecting shelter of the treetops. even if
he were a thousand or more yards

after the short Interval of Stygian
darkness â disclosing the scorched
prase and little tufts of undergrowth.
which dotted, here and there, the plain
ever which he was fleeing, with knobs
cf rusty green.
"Perhaps they won't see me, after
all," thought Jansen, hopefully. But,
even as the thought came to his mind,
It Is a foolish old idea and very much
of a servant girl trick to think it your
bounden duty to put all your allowance
on your back and on the outside where
it will show. Many a girl who presents
a brave silken front as she trips Jaunt
ily down the street would present qujte
a different appearance if she slipped
and was hurried off to the hospital in
an ambulance.
But aside from show there is always
one's own comfort to be considered, al
ways one's pleasure and always the
wear and tear in one's pocket-book.
Together the three make a decidedly
strong combination.
Silk vests and stockings nowadays
ccme in almost every weight, every
design and color and every price. The
very heavy, closely woven vests run
ur to five and six dollars each, but
they are very beautifully made and
are very elaborate, too.
And let me tell you that being
elaborate does not necessarily mean be
ing fragile and perishable. A yoke of
four or five Inches in depth is woven
in some dainty pattern and it serves
as a trimming and a more suitable
and substantial one could not be found.
There is nothing to get out of kilter
by frequent tubbings and the silk Is
stout and soft so that a change of
three or four will easily last a couple
of years.
For the girl who revels in fanciful
cart-wheels, spider-webs and the like
there is the thinner, lighter vest at a
much smaller price, and besides this,
there is the durable plain silk shirt
guaranteed to last until the Judgment
day. If you have kept up at all with
weaves and materials you know that
linen and lisle have been pressed into
service and that they have behaved
more than well. So well, in fact, that
half the underwear worn by well
groomed people are now one or the
other.
If you're inclined to be cold buy
linen gently at first, for it is cool and
rarely fits closely to the body. If you
think you simply cannot afford silk
split the difference and invest in lisle
and then sit back and be happy the
rest of your days.
For be it known to the uninitiated
lisle is made in a weave that acts on
the same principle as linen and while
the open stitch permits the air to reach
the body and the perspiration to out
it clings snugly and is warm and com
fortable.
And another beauty of such wear is
that It is made for you Individually and
consequently fits to a T. You select
your weave, your color and your price
and it is never too long or too tight,
or too anything, but Just right. Per
haps if you're very thin you cannot
appreciate what this means, but tha
stout man or woman who wrestles, with
the problem of doing away with all
bulk knows that a fit is a fit and that
it means more than a little.
Certainly no one thinks high necked,
lonpr sleeved underwear pretty or even
attractive, but alas and alack, it is
often necessary. But even thin It is a
comfort to get it without an array of
small buttons whose chief mission on
earth seems to be hanging by a single
thread or bursting off without a mo
ment's notice. If for no other reason
than this the round necks are prefer
able, for there is no opening other
than the neck and It fits snugly about
the shoulders and chest and looks the
personification of neatness.
Silk stockings are more of a luxury,
he heard a cry In the forest An in
stant's silence followed. Then three
rifles cracked and, ten feet before him,
two leaden messengers tore their way
with a swish, into the grass.
Jansen plunged off at a tangent. He
had some knowledge of long-distance
shooting and had no Idea of allowing
the Tagals to test their range by hold
ing to a straight line. Zigzagging to
the left and right alternately, he ran
as he had never run before. Twice more
he drew their flre without harm to him
self. He must be out of range now, he
told himself. He was gasping for
breach. The heat was intense and a
feeling of dizziness was stealing over
him. For a moment Jansen stopped to
call together his failing faculties, and
almost fell inert from the reaction of
suspended animation. At that moment
the rifles cracked again and something
bit its way into his arm and lay there,,
burning the sinew like a piece of molt
en metal.
Jansen had been shot just above the

elbow, but, strangely enough, the
Mauser bullet proved the fainting mes
senger's salvation. It spurred him Into
action again, for the pain aroused his
nerves and he shook off the inertia
which benumbed him. With a bound,
not unlike that of some enraged beast,
he sprang forward once more, scarcely
knowing why he sped on thus, or
wherefore, but running, running, run
ning â while in his arm there burned an
evil something with a never-ending
heat that trged him on.

It was two days after this that the
little band of men In the stockade, hag

and weak and desperate from the con

and braced themselves, joyously, for an
attack. Anything was better than the
strain of the past forty-eight hours;
the suspense and confinement in a nar
row space, which allowed no one of
them to stand upright or stretch his

limbs. It was evident that a more or
less important movement was in con
templation by the Tagals, who still
besieged the stockade from their forest
concealment, keeping up a desultory
fire which showed that they were con
stantly on the alert. Two men had
been wounded in a second rush for
water and Lieutenant Forrest's cheek
bore an abrasion where a Mauser ball
had grazed it. The detachment wel
comed the coming move as
something definite â a chance for
action. Each man was ready,
ready, nay more than readyâ desperate,
with the combination of steady purpose
and recklessness that makes men terri
ble in battle. But though the bustle
in the enemy's retreat continued, there
w.as no manifestation of a hostile pur
pose. It seemed a retreat; that most
inexplicable of all thingsâ a hasty
flight from an all but conquered foe.
Just then came a sound from west
ward, which explained the mysteryâ a
faint but clearly audible bugle call. A
mute prayer of thanksgiving went up .
from every heart. Reinforcements
were comingâ and the Tagals, whose
sharp eyes had detected their approach
some time before, were decamping with
all possible haste.
Regardless of danger now. Lieutenant
Forrest arose to his feet and directed
his field glass toward the point from
which the sound had come.
"Well, by all that's wonderful! It's
Dugan's troop," he shouted.
Half an hour later Captain Dugan
and Lieutenant Forrest, each seated on
a roll of army blankets, were compar
ing notes.
"He staggered into camp last night,"
Dugan was saying, "more dead than
alive and clean out of his head from
the exertion and the pain in his arm.

Occasionally you will hear some one

good lisle and every little lassie who ;
is in the habit of wearing a trotter

openwork. But she does not treat it
with the same disregard as the Amer

clasps, even if they are made of soft
rubber, are not the best things in the
world for a thin weave and she does l
not pay four, five or six francs for
the pleasure of having a railroad from
her knee to her ankle the first time
she puts them on. Instead she buys
a little tape affair that is about two
inches long. One end is a ring and
the other is double so that the top
of the stocking slips into it. where it
is sewed into place. On her corset
she wears Bilk tapes and she draws
these through the rings in the stock

the lighter and more open fabrics

It's considered rather old-fashioned
to wear wool unless you have rheu

woe. and even then it Is kept out of
sight as much as possible. i
You never hear anybody talking of
wearing gray wool or red flannel.
Somehow or other it is a secret that
you prefer to keep strictly to your

may the fact remains just the same
that wool is wool and that it is never

THE SAN FRANCJSCO SUNDAY CALL.The New Novel Crop
FICTION
in Varied .Fruitage
T~\ A RELY does a modern novel ap
&Â£ peal to aught else than the
reader's capabilities for being
amused, and rarely, indeed, does the
modern novelist seek to do else than to
amuse. If. therefore, Robert Hichens'
new novel, "The Garden of Allah," lays
no claim to distinction other than the
fact that it does more than amuse, we
may accredit it with a worth beyond
the ordinary. This, in fact, is a novel
far from the ordinary. . It is too true,
too tragic, too brimful with \ real and
poignant human emotions to be classed
In the same category with the average
novel of the hour. The tragedy of its
motive cannot be skimmed over at a
sitting, nor can the artistry of its tell
ing suggest aught of the slap-dash
etyle of the made-by-the-yard book
stall attraction, which flourisheth fora
brief 4ay t and. then is known no more.
As a. bppk ... that inspires tremendous .
sympathies, that makes the reader seek
to" learn with the creatures of the print
ed page the r answer to the sphinx rid-;
dle.Vwhy and Wherefore,. "The Gar
den of Allah" takes rank with the best
that haÂ» been written tor many years.
Mr. - ( Mich en c' book makes large de
mands, upon the reader. It searches out
the Innermost recesses of his private
conscience and calls for a judgment.
This because it brings before the bar of
â¢very one's fundamental convictions
the old Question of duty and pleasure
In a manner which admits of no tem
porizing, no evasion. When the plot is
followed to the end and the final trag
edy Is pushed to Its uttermost consum
mation the reader must ask himself:
Was it right; was It Just? Then, may
bap, he will discover in himself a
shadow of opportunismâ a taint of the
old Adam that will not die. For the
conscientious reader the moving in
spiration of Robert Hichens* book is
Inevitable, and for that reason also it
may be classed beyond the ordinary.
"The Garden of Allah" is built
â .bout the clash between asceticismâ
the stern, monastic sense of duty to
one Being, far removed and invisibleâ
and pantheism, or the Intuitive wor
ship of an All-present One In nature.
This motive, at first sight one smack-
Ing over-much of theological pro
fundity. Is developed through a sym
bolism of moving force in such man
ner that the reader feels throughout
the broad; flowing current of the
story's inspiration -without' having out
ward and visible sign of the same In
truded upon his direct sensing. â  The
great desert of Sahara, with its hot,
passionate breath calling for life of
the fullest and dictating the pres
ence of such a divinity as the Satur
nallans used to worship* Vorks upon
the souls of one man and one woman,
in which resides the spirit of ascet
icism. At one time pantheism con
quers; these two" mortals, held in the
grip of the world's waste places, see
about them a god who calls from the
sands, the wavering palms, the wa
ter rills, bidding ' that they should
be one with \ the kindred of nature.
Over against-, this sounds the . higher
call of all that is unswervingly stead
fast to the laws of an orthodoxy; duty
armed with the r brand of an establish
ed religion, sets itself as a guardian
against this Garden of Allah. <â¢ and â¢ in
the end duty triumphs. . â¢ .
A girl who goes to an oasis city in
the desert, there to escape suffering
and to search out her â  own doubting
heart, meets with a man who is mark- â 
ed among his fellows because of ; his
tremendous burden of guilt-^-guilt
that he keeps locked within his own
heart through fear and shame. They
draw near to one another through the |
compelling influence of the desert
mystery of the primitive, they love
and are married. Then In the vast
ness of the sands, when they seem â¢
to have approached closest together In
thought and sympathy and *to V have -
given themselves over to the forget
ting inspired by > the weird of the vast â 
unknown, the revelation of the man's
sin comes. Expiation, bitter, terrible, .
is exacted by the woman. Â Through
expiation comes ; love for God, the su
preme and far removed, -arid the as
sumption of His yoke of duty. . ;
That is the bare outline of I the plot;
the splendid scenic envelope J given it -
and the complete infusion of the desert
atmosphere with the details of the mo- " ;
tive make a book of remarkable' vivid
ness and power. Hlchens\ Sahara'plct
ROBERT W. RITCHIE
ures are burning ones. From the very
beginning of the story the Sahara sears
and crackles into the reader's vision
with a force at some times positively
awe-inspiring. The sparkle of the least
arid bit of crystal, the tinge of the
smallest rose petal in the oasis are not
too small to escaDe the eye of the au
thor. Every changing aspect of the
great sea of sand is recorded with
words that in themselves add tones to
the picture.
Though it is difficult to choose for
quotation from Hichens' book, there is
one passage which gives the full com
pass of the desert spiritâ the spirit of
supreme passion:
"She looked and listened till she saw
a grander procession troop by, gar
landed with mystery and triumph: War
as a shape with woman's eyes; Nighty
without poppies, leading the stars and
moon and all the vigorous dreams that
must come true; Love of woman that
cannot be set aside, but will govern the
world from Eden to the abyss into
which the nations fall to the out
stretched hands of God; Death as Life's
leader, with a staff from which sprang
blossoms red as the western sky; Sav
age Fecundity, that crushes all barren
things into the silent dust; and then the
Desert.
"That came in a pale cloud of sand,
â¢with a pale crowd of worshipers â those
who had received gifts from the Des
ert's hands and sought more; murder
ers who Kad gained sanctuary with
barbaric jewels in their blood-stained
hands; once tortured men and women
who had cast away terrible recollections
In the wastes among the dunes and in
the treeless, purple distances, and who
had been granted the sweet oases of
forsetfulness to dwell in;- ardent beings
who had striven vainly to rest content
with the world of hills and valleys, of
sea-swept verges and murmuring riv
ers, and who had been driven by the la
boring soul on and on toward the flat
plains where roll forever the golden
wheels of the cTiariot of the sun."

York; price $1 50.)
"Mysterious Mr. Sabin," by E. Phil
lips Oppenheim, is one of the best
stories of pure adventure that has ap
peared for a year. Mr. Oppenheim
Beems a born story teller. Swiftly he
publishes one absorbing tale of mystery
after the other, all differing in plot, but
all written with a keen eye to the dra
matic and literally humming with ac
tion. This last story quite excels any
thing the young English author has
done.
In stories such as Oppenheim writes
the success or failure of the thing de
pends upon one point aloneâ that
breathless suspense must be maintained
from cover to cover. In no place must
there be a sag in the action nor a weak
place in the plot, else the reader will
find time to reason concerning the un
reasonableness of the whole tale. Nor
must there be at any time the least
hint as to the denouement, for then the
whole action crumbles and dissipates
into thin air, like an Aladdin's castle.
Romance allows no introspection; a
touch of the realities of things, and it
vaniÃhes.
Nothing short of a threatened war
between two world powers serves Op
penheim for a pivot upon which to
hinge this last story. And the dogs of
â¢war are held in the hand of one man
as unscrupulous a villain yet as fas
cinating a personage as one would meet
between book covers. That man is the
mysterious Mr. Sabin. He enters the
story in immaculate evening dress, es
corting a ravishing beauty, who imme
diately sets by the ears several of Lon
don's unemployed young aristocrats.
Before three chapters have passed un
der our eyes this same mysterious
Sabin dodges an assassin's knife by a
matter of inches, talks in the closet of
a German Embassador and comports
himself generally as one mysterious in
deed. All the "while â and here Oppen
heim shows his art as a story-tellerâ
both the man and his fair charge offer
absolutely no clew to identification,
move under a heavy cloud of secrecy,
which remains impenetrable even to
the young men, who diligently seek to
break through.
Suddenly the freak of a madman be
gins to turn the thread of affairs. A
retired British admiral, once an
authority upon the matter of Britain's
naval arm and the strength of her de
fenses, coops himself up in his study
with armed guards at every portal and
busies himself with a stupendous re
port upon the weakness of England
against possible Toes. Thither gravi
Authors Whose Books Are Widely Read
ROBERT HICHEMS, whose latest novel, "The Garden of Allah/ was
among the "ten best sellers" in London before it was published in
America, is rated with the best of English authors. Hichens' former work
has been of a various nature. "Felix," the first book by winch he was gen>
e rally known, is a Balzacian study of contemporary life; "The Green
Carnation," a story of society, fell rather flat because of its banalities; the
pseudo' mystical "Flames" and "The Imaginative Man" only gave a faint
idea of the author's possibilities. A recent novel, "The Woman With the
Fan/ coupled with his last story, have evidently made Hichens' place
among the younger English writers assured. One critic of authority
recently said: "We are confident that Mr. Hichens is entitled to a place
among the ten leading English writers of fiction."
The author of "Mysterious Mr. Sabin/' E. Phillips Oppenheim, is
another young Englishman whose work has gained steady appreciation
both in England and this country. In the London magazines his serials
and short stories are invariably featured by the far sighted publishers and
the reception of his books is spontaneous. "The World s Great Snare,"
"A Millionaire of Yesterday/ "The Survivor" and "Anna the Adven>
turess" are books by which he is best known. Like many of his confreres,
Mr. Oppenheim found a peculiar interest in Ametica in the person of a wife.
tates mysterious Mr. Sabinâ to play
golf ostensibly. Treachery, midnight
encounters, a daring ruse and the ad
miral's papers are missing, while from
Germany comes the report that war
will be declared in a fortnight. How
war is averted and Sabln's plans
brought to naught by the most mys
terious of all mysterious agencies, and
how the arch conspirator himself
neatly fools the agents of the Kaiser,
on revenge bentâ these events bring
the novel to its climax and clear all
mysteries.
There is more to the Btory than the
swift march of action. Upon the char
acter of Sabin Oppenheim bestows
some telling touches. Of course Impos
sible, but seeming possible is this cen
tral figure in the novel. So surely
does the author outline the indomitable
daring and the tremendous resource
fulness of the man, so naturally does
he make him think, act, speak that
while the reader's head is in the book
he is fooled into belief that to-morrow's
paper may detail some diplomatic in
trigue in which the hand of Sabin
holds a compelling grip. He is a good
teller of tales who can thus cloak un
reality with a cunning fabric of plaus
ibility-

adds to the list of her very successful
THE SAN FRANCISCO SUNDAY CALL 1 . 1
books by "The Millionaire Baby." It
Is a story suffioiently attractive in
parts, well conceived in parts, but lack
ing rs a whole in that tense dramatic
interest which is supposed to attend
the typical detective story. Perhaps
this is because the author has sought
to vary the somewhat monotonous pro
gramme of the stereotyped mystery
story by introducing a touch of the
"problem novel," not altogether suc
cessfully.
A little girl, worth millions, sud
denly disappears from the home of
her mother on the Hudson. Her baby
shoe is found in the water. Mysterious
chalk marks In the manner of a warn
ing are distributed over every avail
able place on the estate. A terrible
old man seems to be responsible for
her disappearance. Her mother and
one other woman are distracted by
her absence and a munificent reward
for her recovery is offered. With this
much known the reader follows the
adventures of an aspiring detective
through all sorts of hidden mysteries,
occult occurrences and discouraging
disappointments in the old style way,
until suddenly a revelation begins to
dawn upon him. It seems that the
little one is possessed of a putative
mother who clings to her from mo
tives as strong even as that of mother
love. This complicates things im
mensely, .and a distinct moral prob
lem is raised. After all the groping*
and vain prowlings after light have
been completed the author answers
this problem suddenly and satisfactor
ily, and the story is done.
The usual thrill is not part of this
story. Perhaps we have been spoiled
by being: led to anticipate such in
every tale of the kind, but certainly
its lack is hardly compensated for by
the introduction of the moral problem.
Clever as this may be in its concep
tion and handling, insatiate readers
of tales of mystery will have none of
it in their choice. ,

JOYS
of a Country Home
// *|O life is broader, freer or
/\ fuller than life on the land,"
says E. P. Powell in his
book, "The Country Home,"
and it is a call to all of us crowded,
wearied, smoke-eating *?ity dwellers
that he makes through the printed
page â a call to live this broad, free,
full life. Many of us doubtless would
answer it willingly if we could; per
haps after reading the book we may
begin to see how we can.
The author is of the opinion that
the life of the city must soon share
with the country its exclusive domi
nation. "The tide outward from the
city," says he, "is carrying the people,
under the influence of conditions that
seem at first quite similar to those
which surrounded our fathers of aev
enty-flve years agoâ conditions that
created a degree of uniformity in cus*
toms and a very fixed equality of
privileges. But. looking deeper,
we shall see that old things are not
to be repeated. There will be a com
bination of country and city life â
country freedom with city culture.
New Ideas will take root easily, and
new methods. The latest scientific
information will be sought and ap
plied. No one will be isolated. These
homes will be joined by telephones, so
that we can talk together, plan to
gether, laugh together. I think we
shall have an age of real democracy â
at least of growing democracy."
An Arcadian prospect this and one
which we all of us would like to see
come to its realization. Secured by
his enthusiasm, Mr. Powell believes
that the beginnings of this new
democracy of rural life must find their
inspiration from every walk of life.
The factory laborer must build him
self a home in the country, linked
with the city though it must be by the
speedy traction line, so that he can
escape, for a few hours at least, from,
the moil and grind of machinery. The
professional man can afford to go still
farther afield and 'stablish his lares
and penates on some ralr hillside,
where his children may grow rosy
cheeked and drink strength from the
soil. Rousseau redivivus with Parson
Wagner seconding.
Powell's earnestness does not in
vite more than a good-natured gibe,
however. To show just how one may
live in the country and at the same
time be self-supporting in a large
measure he has written this book of
generous compass full of practical
hints. He tells one how to choose the
site for a house, how to build that
house or renovate an old one that may
be on the property, what to plant in
the garden, how to raise strawberries,
fight mosquitoes, feed a hog, induce
the modest hen to procreate her kind
â In short, how to do all that is neces
sary to live like another Virgil upon
another Sabine Farm.

NEWS
of the Book World
â¢w t r RITING upon "Balzac, the
yy Man and the Novelist," In a
London periodical, John Oli
ver Hobbes has these pertinent things
to say: "In his romances Balzac had
many manners. He was influenced by
Sir Walter Scott, by Byron, by Victor
Hugo â in fact, by all the literary
fashions of his generation. But his
own spiritual attitude toward the
world remained unalterable. His
stories, in their style, are now melo
dramatic, now idyllic, now metaphysi
cal; now historical. Rabelaisian or
fantastic; now drawn from the prov
inces, or inspired by the gayest city
of the earth, pitched in the Alps, or
burled in the back shop of an obscure
town; now in the courts of princes,
now In the squalor of base neighbor
hoods. But the writer himself,
whether describing 1 a wrangle in a
boarding-house, or a dialogue between
mystics, or an atrocious crime, or a
martyr's death, or a scene of boister
ous comedy, or the farewell of lovers,
keeps his own soul and his own
inimitable self-command in observa
tion. There we have the secret of his
fascination for some readers and his
repulsion for others. Many admire,
but more detest, self-command â this
power of detachment, this good sense
in not falling fatuously enamored of
one's own characters, the genius for
presenting a plot with Justice to all
the parties concerned, that physician's
curious care for a bad case which may
seem loathsome at worst, and weari
some at best, to the lay mind. With
all Balzac's exuberance, his passion
ateness, his unreasonableness, and his
eccentricities amounting to a kind of
insanity, his compositions are prob
ably the least emotional of any crea
tive author. 'I have a horror,' he
writes to his sister, 'of betraying my
own feelings in literature.' "
M. Francois Coppee in the February
Critic gives his "Recollections of Vic
tor Hugo," whom he came to know
Intimately during the months of the
siege when Hugo had returned to
Paris. The poet had taken a fur
nished apartment whose windows
looked on the Place dv Theater Fran
cais, and there gave dinners at which
Theopblle Gautier, Theodore de Ban
villa and others of that set indulged
heartily In wit and somewhat sparing
!y In horse-fleshâ for those were thÂ»
ciaya when they were making their
ftrÂ«t descriptive experiments in 'hippo
phagie.' " Says M. Coppee:
It was for Gautler's charming daugh
ter that Hugo, who loved a joke, wrote
at this time the quatrain In which he
makes allusion to the horse-flesh which
was then almost the only food of the
Parisian:
SI vous etlez ver.ue. o beauts que J" admire.
Je vous aurais offert un featin sans rival :
J'aurals tua Pegase cc JÂ» I" aural* rait cuir*
Afta de vous dormer une all* da cheval'.
Here I may record one of his con
versations which I must confess struck
me as rather comical. One evening as
he was protesting against the horrors
of war. he suddenly expressed an idea
that was certainly very strange. He
would, he said, address a challenge to
the King of Prussia, whose armies
then besieged Paris.
"We are both old," he said. "He is a
powerful sovereign, and it is agreed
that I am a great poet. We are there
fore equal. Why should we not decide
the quarrel which divides our two na
tions by single combat and spare so
many lives?"
In view of the appearance In the
spring of a cheap popular edition of
Thomas Nelson Page's latest novel,
"Gordon Keith." 120,000 copies of which
have already sold in the regular edi
tion, it is Interesting to know that Mr.
Page's popularity is represented by
sales since his first book was published
in 1887 of considerably more than haJf
a million volumes. The sales of his first
long novel, "Red Rock." which was
published in 1893. are in excess of those
of "Gordon Keith" and show no signs
of abating. More than 100,000 copies
have also been sold of Mr. Page's books
for younger readers, "Two Little Con
federates," "A Captured Santa Claus"
and "Santa Claus' Partner." Meanwhile
his first book of short stories, "In Old
Virginia," containing "Marse Chan."
"Meh Lady." etc.. has long since at
tained to the position of an American
classic and has sold by the tens of
thousands, as has also hla shorter
novel, "The Old Gentleman of the
Black Stock." both of which are still in
constant demand. The increasing vital
ity of all of Mr. Page's books is their
noteworthy characteristic.
A rather unique method of discover -
ing just what the library means In the
lives of the people ts one recently
adopted by the public library of the
city of Osnabruck, Germany. Circulars
were sent to each of the readers asking
how they had formerly spent the hours
that they now spend in the library,
and whether their reading 1 had resulted
in any particular gain to them, either
personally or in their work. The re
plies showed that 62 per cent of those
responding had spent the time now
given to the library in reading news
papers and other such publications,
end that 30 per cent of them had pre
viously spent this time in cafes with
friends, or in playing cards. Nlnety
flve per cent were enthusiastic as to
what the library had done for them, in
deepening and enriching their lives,
broadening their ideaa, and making the
burdens of life easier. Many of the
artisans claimed a direct business gain
in the use of books on design and sim
ilar works.

IRELAND PAYS HONOR
TO PRINCE OF WALES
Gala Festivities in Dublin
Ball at the Castle in Which the Duchess
of Marlborough Figures Prominentlu,
-. Â â  - ..â¢-- ,'â¢
LONDON. Feb. 18.â The visit of the
Prince of Wales to Ireland is at an end,
after nearly a week of social festivities
In Dublin. The royal visitor was ac
corded all the distinction in keeping
with his rank, and seemed to enjoy
every minute of his stay. *?/â¢â¢;*Â£â¢
The Prince arrived in â¢ Dublin on
Tuesday from Cong, where he had been
visiting Lord and Lady Ardilaun, and
â where his royal highness had his first
experience in woodcock shooting. The
visit of the Prince to Lord and Lady
I >ud; was considered purely a private
one. There was little show, of decorar
"tion in Dublin streets, but the welcome
to the Irish capital- was none the less
enthusiastic- for all that. ' - '.
Arriving at the castle': the â  Prince .
found, a large arid distinguished party
assembled in his honor. f there being
over fifty people staying: there, includ
ing the Duke and .Duchess of Marl
borough. Lord â¢ and Lady, .Ormonde,
Lord and Lady Mayo, Lady Essex,
Lord and Lady Ingestre, Lord and
Lady Algernon Gordon Lennox and
Lord and Lady Lurgan.
MANY ENTERTAIN GUESTS.
Many other distinguished people also
entertained parties for the week, not- â â 
ably Lord and Lady Grenfell, who have
had their residence, known as the
royal hospital, filled with guests, and
Lord and Lady Iveagh, in their mag
nificent house at St. Stephen's Green.
The week's festivities may be said to
have begun Tuesday night with a ball
at Dublin Castle, which, as usual,
opened with a royal quadrille. In this
Lord Dudley and the Duchess of Marl
borough faced the Prince ;of .Wales
and Lady Dudley, while others taking
part included Lady Essex and the Duke
of Marlborough.
The most beautifully dressed woman
in the room was undoubtedly Lady
Algernon Gordon Lennox, who wore
a smart dress of. quite a new shade of
lark hyacinth blue satin, with a clus
ter of the same colored flowers on the
bodice. On her head was a crown of
diamonds and she wore a. necklace of
the same in a Greek key pattern.. -
INTEREST IN DUCHESS.
The Duchess of Marlborough natur
ally was, the object of great interest.
Over her dress of white satin was an
oversklrt of white chiffon, with long
ruchings.of the same.; She wore a large
crown of diamonds and her famous dog
collar of pearls around her neck, ' with
ropes of other large pearls, ." while an
ornament, of five enormous emeralds
surrounded by diamonds caused quite a
shimmer in front of the bodice. - â¢
The San Francisco Call.
Lady Essex, who seldom looked bet
ter, wore black chiffon relieved by sil
ver paillettes, a diamond - tiara and a
great diamond ornament on the cor
sage.
One feature of the evening ' was the
debut of Miss Ivy Gordon Lennox, only
-daughter of Lord and Lady Algernon
Gordon Lennox. She is a pretty and
dainty replica' of her beautiful mother,
with wonderful color and charming
manner. She was dressed in all white,
with tiny bouquets of flowers on the
dress. . . . -.i- â¢ â 
'Mrs. Adair was there, and so was
Mrs. Jack â¢ Leslie, chaperoning her
niece. Miss Moreton.Frewen. Nearly all
the men were in uniform, and it was
noticed that the Duke of Marlborough
was the only one ; wearing the order of
the garter.
ANOTHER GRAND BAM;..
, Wednesday night came another grand
ball at the royal ' hospital, given by
Lord and Lady Grenfell, the proceed
ings opening, again with a state quad
rille, in which the Prince of Wales
again had for his partner Lady Dudley,
the Duchess of Marlborough < dancing
with Lord Grenfell and Lady Essex
with : George ' Wyndham, Chief Secre
tary for Ireland. '_â  ' r
The dresses were, on the whole, even
better than at : the > castle ball ; the pre
vious -evening. The Duchess â of Marl- ,
borough 5 stood out prominently ;in an
exquisite toilet of Hungarian 7 blue satin
and her famous pearls. â¢, Lady Essex
wore a simple gown of pale mauve
chiffon. Lady Algernon Gordon ' Len
nox made a fine picture. in a dress of
white silk with huge bouquets of col-,
ored . flowers. The skirt was â¢ arranged
with a long train and pansies on either
side.- Mrs. Adair, who was accompan
ied by her niece. Miss Wads worth, was
dressed, in pale blue. under black lace.

AMERICANS
ARE EXPERT
AT BRIDGE
Mrs. Mackey Bests
the Duchess of
Devonshire.
LONDON, Feb. 18.â It is being re
marked of two prominent American
women in London society that they can
fairly claim to be champions at bridge.
Not only have they yet to meet defeat,
but they have several times expressed
their willingness to try conclusions
with any other two players, male or
female, and found no takers. These
two bridge experts are Mrs. Frank
Mackey and Lady Lisler-Kaye. It was
considered at one time that the Duch
ess of Devonshire could give points to
any player in England, but at a bridge
party at Devonshire House one evening
not long ago Mrs. Frank Mackey easily
established her superiority over the
Duchess.
It is not generally known that Mrs.
Clayton Glyn, the brilliant author of
"The Visits of Elizabeth," is a great
authority on antiquities. She has been
acting as Mr. and Mrs. Van Alen's rep
resentative in the purchase of "the art
treasures with which they intend to
stock their country residence, Rushton
Hall. This in itself constitutes a guar
antee that the collection will be a val
uable and genuine one.
The expatriated American millionaire
has wiseiy entrusted its arrangement
entirely to Mrs. Glyn, whose taste is
not one whit inferior to her judgment
as a connoisseur. She has long; lived
in England, but was born in Canada,
and the benevolent fairy who presided
at her birth added to the many gifts
bestowed upon her that of beauty.
Van Alen is an old friend of hers.
Some years ago he Invited her to visit
him at his Newport mansion and prom
ised her the best time of her life. Be
fore he couW redeem his pledge he fell
ill and in consequence the visit was
novel paid.
Mrs. Glyn's sister. Lady Duff-Gordon,
is also a remarkably astute and clever
woman, who makes a lot of money out

of her artistic gifts. Under the name
of "Lucille" she conducts a fashionable
dressmaking establishment in Hanover
Square. It was she who designed the
much discussed "emotional gowns" for
Mrs. Brown Potter in "The Golden

It was Mrs. Glyn who supplied the
names bestowed on them that did so
much to exe-ite public curiosity.
Among them were "A Frenzied Song
of Amorous Things" and "The Sigh

LONDONERS
WILD OVER
GAMBLING
Women and
Men Have
the Fever.
FORM NEW CLUBS
High Stakes in
Exclusive
Sets.
PEERS INVOLVED
LONDON, Feb. 18.â Gambling never
reached such a pitch in London society
as to-day, women being even more
reckless than men. Almack's Club, in
King street, started last autumn .by
the most exclusive set to enable men
and women to play, is so full morning,
afternoon and night that it has been
found necessary to extend the prem
ises, providing four additional spacious
card rooms.
Stories are in circulation of large
sums won and lost by women, married
and single, who are heavily involved
and therefore under obligations to men,
which is a lively source of scandal.
Late at night, after theaters and pri
vate parties, they go to Almack's, play
ing until far into the morning.
The Atlantic Club in Dover street,
where young swells gambled freely,
came to grief, but has been revived by
a South African multi-millionaire, and
bridge and baccarat are now in full
swing, while so feverish is the demand
for gambling facilities that another
club has been established a few doors
away; to accommodate those vvhO can
not get into the Atlantic, the member
ship of which was filled within two
days of its restarting.
The whole affair has become a stu-
pendous scandal, accounting in some
measure for the practical interest
evinced in the Torrey-Alexander mis
sion by certain social bigwigs. The
Anti-Betting League, originated to
check horse-race wagering, is endeav
oring to stir the authorities to attack
these clubs as equally illegal. Obscure
gambling: clubs in Soho, chiefly patron
ized by foreigners, are constantly raid
ed by the police, but the authorities are
reluctant to adopt any measure that
would result in the appearance in the
dock of a police court of a horde of the
best-known men and women In society
and the court â peers, members of Par
liament, and even of the Government
itself. The subject will be raised in
Parliament at the. first opportunity.

Bridge* Draws More Than Prayer.
LONDON, Feb. 18. â The colossal
preparations that are being made for
the conversion of the West End un
der the leadership of the American re
vivalists have not diminished the pop
ularity of bridge among the social
elect. Classes for instruction in the
fascinating game are far better at
tended than the prayer-meetings
which a few evangelical aristocratic
folk have started in Mayfair to pave
the way for the revival.
COUNT SZAPARY SUDDENLY
LEAVES BUDAPEST.
LEADER OF SOCIETY
IN THE CAPITAL CITY
SPENDS A FORTUNE ON HIS FRIENDS
VIENNA, Feb. 18. â Count Paul
Saapary, . leader of - Hungarian aristo
crats, millionaire, , spendthrift and
business man, has suddenly left Buda
pest and debts of some 5,000,000 crowns
behind him. His disappearance is the
one topic of conversation in the Hun
garian capital. His friends declare
that he Has only gone to Paris and will
return in a few weeks. The Countess,
, a wealthy Polish aristocrat, has also
left Budapest and gone to her estates
in Russian Poland.
Count Paul Szapary is perhaps the
. most prominent social figure in Aus
tria-Hungary, certainly in the last
named half of = the dual . monarchy.
Only 33 years of age, wealthy, hand
some, charming and lavishly hospit
able, the Count is the beau ideal of a
Hungarian nobleman. No distin
guished stranger ever came to Buda
pest without becoming the guest of the
Count. King Edward, when Prince of
Wales; Princess Charlotte of Mein
ingen, sister of the German Emperor;
the Duchess of Marlborough, the Duke
of Hamilton; Countess Lonyay, widow
of the Crown Prince Rudolphâ these
names testify to the international
character of the Count's princely hos
pitality. â¢
This princely hospitality, coupled
with an equally extravagant mode of
living and all the Hungarian passion
for the card table are said to be re
sponsible for the present disorganized
state of the Count's finances. In spite
of vast revenues from his estates and
the income of a rich wife, the Count
is said in the last few months to have
made -such' shipwreck of his fortunes
that' he cannot even maintain a mod
erate i state in society. His relatives
have repeatedly extricated him from
ftnaietel difficulties before â * and are
; now trying to arrange his affairs.
BIG GAMBLING LOSSES.
The Count's present troubles are said
to be * entirely due to his gambling
losses, which " ten ; years ago amounted
to large sums. Puring the season of
1895 and 1896 ; the Count Is reported , to
have lost about 2.000,000 crowns in the
famous Casino Club at Budapest, the
â¢chief resort of the card-playing Hun
garian magnates. A quarter of a mil
lion crowns is often lost and won in 'a
single evening's play there. Very high
personages have sat at these card ta
blesâKing Edward, of course, before
his accession to the throne, the Grand
Duke Alexis of Russia and other impe
rial and royal personages. The Duke
of Hamilton is saM to have lost 10,000
golden ducats at baccarat in one even
ing's play at the Casino.
After a long night's sitting in August,
1896, Count - Paul Szapary lost 250,000
crowns. His secretary telegraphed
next day to the Count's eldest brother,
Count Ladislaus ; Szapary, Governor of
Fiume, > to come to Budapest imme
diately, as Count Paul would probably
gamble away his entire fortune. Count
Ladislaus came, and forced his younger
brother to give his word of honor not
o touch. a card again before his ap
proaching marriage.
Count Paul kept his word honorably,
but managed nevertheless to find other
ways of dissipating his money. In the
magnificent Park Club at Budapest he
arranged a series of gorgeous festivi
ties, the chief cost of which fell gen
erally upon himself. L Every winter
found him at the head of Budapest so
ciety; no ball nor entertainment was
complete Â» without him. His liberality
was unbounded. He contributed 20,000
crowns to a single opera ball. He seized
every opportunity of giving costly din
ners. â¢'---. â¢
LAVISH ENTERTAINMENTS. a
It ' was hunting which, next â¢to card
playing, made the most serious inroads
upon his bank balance. At his estates,
Sorok Ujfaln ; and Ragy Unyom, the
Count ' entertained ' large sporting _ par-,
ties in princely style. His house was
full at least three times every season,
his guests sometimes numbering nearly
100 men and women. Many distin
guished visitors, ; came from foreign
lands.;: They came }in ; special , trains
provided \ by v the . host. Celebrated
*. actors and , singers were . brought down
from Vienna and Budapest to amuse
. them, .; and .no money was spared to
make their visit agreeable. ,
One of the most famous house parties
was in '-. the soring of , 1903, when Con
suelo, Duchess - ; of. Marlborough, who
was, then staying, in Vienna, Lady No
rah V Churchill - and a crowd of other
well-known society people were enter
; tamed by the Count. His ; hospitalities
: then were not confined to his own coun-
. try house, but 'he gave ; , his 'â  guests " a
I magnificent"; entertainment at the Park
; Club .in Budapest upon â¢ their : return
there. , ' " . "^
. The Count's extravagant expendi
'â â  tures soon outran his income, although
his great estate brought in revenues of
some' 3,000,000 crowns a year. ! In. the
hope of checking his mad career 1 his
family persuaded him to 'marry, and in
.' IB9B "â¢ he took as his r wife: a wealthy Pol
ish lady of noble. family, ; Maria Louise
Prezdziecka. \ Her â¢ fortune amounted â to
10,000,000 T crowns, but the dowry which
, her husband actually received upon the
: marriage ' was only 1700,000 : crowns.
CRUSHED BY HIS DEBTS.
_ Shortly afterward ; Count Paul was
Pages 17 to 24
elected president of the Park Club and
of the Hungarian Automobile Club. Re
leased by his marriage from his prom
ise to abstain from card-playing, the
Count again began to gamble. He lost
enormous sums at St. Petersburg.
Monte Carlo. Paris and Budapest. In
1901 his brother, Ladislaus, was again
forced to come to the rescue, and at
considerable sacrifice rescued him from
impending bankruptcy.
His friends then attempted to interest
him in more serious pursuits. The Hun
garian society for promoting tourist
travel in their country made the Count
its president, and he also became a di
rector of the International Sleeping Car
Company, whose oars run through thf
principal countries in Europe. The
Count, however, failed to fulfill the
hopes entertained for him.
His financial troubles increased. He
had borrowed large sums from the
great banking Institutions, from the
Hungarian Mortgage Bank nearly
2,000,000 crowns. 600,000 crowns from the
Agrarian Bank and 300.000 crowns from
the Hungarian Savings Bank. Unable
to obtain more advances from such
concerns, the Count began to borrow
from his friends sums ranging from
5000 to 10.000 crowns. It was the grow
ing importunity of these smaller cred
itors that forced the Count to leave
his palace in Budapest and go, as it
is said, to Paris until some arrange
ment could be come to with his cred
itors.
The lawyers assert that after full
payment has been made to all his cred
itors the Count will still have enough
money to keep up a tolerable position
in society. The Countess is reported
to have gone to look after her estates
in Russian Poland and keep them free
from her husband's monetary entangle
ments.
ThÂ« Szaparys are a very ancient
Hungarian family, tracing then
scent back for centuries. They were
not ennobled until 1690, when the first
Baron Szapary waÂ» created. In 1722
they got another step In the peerage
and became Counts.
Count Paul's eldest brother, Ladis
laus, Governor of Fiume, is a promi
nent person in the political and official
world. He came rather unpleasantly
before the public eye some months ag'>
when Count Khuen Hedervary, the
then Minister President of Hungary,
was charged with attempting to brih^
certain Deputies. Count Ladislaus
Szapary stepped into the breach ami
said that it was he who had attempted
the bribery out of friendship to Count
Khuen Kedervary.
GAMBLERS ATTEND CHTRCH.
HOPING TO FIND IXCK
Many English People and American*
at Monte Carlo Show Tendency
Toward Piety.
LONDON. Feb. 18. â Monte Carlo is
fast filling up. English and American
patrons of the gambling tables fre
quently resort to the little English
church there, impelled by the notion
that such manifestations of piety will
insure them a spell of good luck. It
is due to the attention which the
church has received from the devotees
of chance that no hymn is ever given
out to be sung there below No. :;:.
Thereby hangs an interesting history.
An English peer after attending
service there one morning went to the
rooms and put the maximum on 32.
the number of the last hymn. It
turned up. The nobleman did not
keep to himself the source of his
luclijr inspiration. Next Sunday the
little church was crowded, much to
the gratification of the officiating
clergyman. But the bulk of the con
gregation did not tarry for the ser
mcn. After the last hymn, which
again chanced to be a low number,
had been given out, an unseÂ«mly rush
for the doors took place and a helter
skelter race for the Casino.
The long arm of coincidence served
again. Once more the number of the
last hymn turned up and the bank
was badly hit On the following Sun
day the church would not hold the
crowd that flocked to it and a large
number of people waited patiently
outside for the announcement of the
number of the last hymn. But mean
while the pastor learned of the situa
tion. After bestowing a glance of
withering scorn on the eager, up
turned faces, he announced a number
that was well up in lite centuries and
the expression of glad expectancy was
replaced by one of deep, penitential
gloom. Since then no hymn who*
number "was on the board" has been
sung in the church.
Coqueltn Would Be Senator.
PARIS, Feb. 18. â M. Coquelin's de
cision to pose as a candidate for the
vacant Senatorship in the Pas de Co

so conversant with acts that he should

dullest acts of Parliament. Among

Mr. D'Orsay was "stopping at the
St. Frahncis, dou'tcherknow." his
press agent told me, quoting. Accord
ingly to the "St. Frahneis" I went to
victimize the flower of the English
stage chivalry for the week's chat.
Mr. D'Orsay was in the red and gold
hall, himself delightfully pink, waist
boated to distraction, an enormous
white carnation in his coat and carry
ing his stick with the air of two Earls.
After the conventional how-dye-dos"
I asked the actor how he really felt
after the lons journey out here.
Confidentially Mr. D'Orsay told vs â
the artist and me â as we made for the
elevator: "I feel like a boiled owl,
tion'tcherknow!"
I hadn't been one, but 1 nodded a
wise 'yes." and then ventured: "How
delightfully Mr. Thomas has drama
tized you in 'The Earl of Pawtucket.
â even to the carnation!"
"Yes, that is what all you people
say," Mr. D'Orsay drawled, and
smiled -under his dragoon mustache.
You are like the little English mat
inee girl, you know, that came to me
and said after a performance â 1 had
been a dragoon in one of George Ed
wardee' productions ' Mr. D'Orsay.
aren't you a real dragoon?' 'Of course
1 am, 1 I said, 'didn't you see the uni
form?' 'There, I told you,' she said
to her friend. And." Mr. D'Orsay
added with most engaging enjoyment
of his own slyness, "I told her that
even when we had water cart men on
the stage we had real ones; they
could do the thing so much better!"
"In short you â cr â spoofing."
I quoted.
A little anxiously, as we entered the
elevator, he answered me with this 5 :
"But you don't think it wrong when
people ask such silly ass questions.
do rou?"
As gravely I replied: "It seems to
me almost a solemn duty in such
< ases, Mr. D'Orsay," and, satisfied, the
actor led the way into the warm
trown velveted room where we were
to talk.
"Didn't know, you know, that you
were going to take a photograph of
me." h<Â» began, as the camera came
out- "You may, you know, if you will
take gceat care of me, hide the rav
ages of time and all that sort of
thing, so that the matinee girls will
not think that I am more than â
ha. ha."
It is good to hear the D'Orsay
l;Â«ugh. a wholesome, happy, musical
"ha. ha!" directed always against
his own and not the other man's
weaknesses.
"Drop your chin," the photographer
-ommanded here.
"Cawn't. my boy; never do." Mr.
D'Onsay protested, throwing the au
pusi feature still higher. ' But he
managed after all to bring it down
so as to permit' the rest of the face
to come within the camera. You
would like all of it, the clear, kind.
fearless blue eyes, the strong, aqui
' Jine nose, the fresh, ruddy color, the
kind mouth under the long straw
coiored mustache. And it is to be
hoped that the picture will do justice
to the virtuoso raiment that adorned
ihe actor's soldierly figure. Emphat
ically, it "belongs."
The posing over, I asked the actor
if "D'Orsay" were his real name. Un
like the little English matinee girl, we
knew here that it was not "Lord Card
injrton," but some of us imagined he
might be at least a duke.
The actor laughed as if the insinua
tion were by no means new, and said:
"No, plain Lawrence D'Orsay, I as
sure you. In fact, really D'Orsay Law
rence. Funny, but the chaps at school
used to call me 'little Count D'Orsay,*
1 was a nice, clean little boy, you
know. Very well "brought up,' I sup
pose. I'd like to say, If you think it
at all fitting," he looked up with a
smile of extraordinary sweetness, "that
a man owes all he has of goodness and
refinement to his mother. I owe every
thing that is good in me to mine."
"I know of no time unfit to say that.
Mr. D'Orsay," I told. him. and wished
only that I could transcribe with the
words their sheer reverence and ten
derness.
"As to 'D'Orsay,' " the actor went on,
"I took the name to please my mother."
"Did she like your going on the
stage?" I asked.
"Oh, Lord, no!" the actor exclaimed.
"All my people were lawyers, and I,
too, was educated for the law. But I
didn't like it. I was always acting in
amateur things, and one day walked
off to the theaters."

"What did you da first?"
"Oh," the D'Orsay hands spread
themselves hopelessly, "everything. I
could not tell you what I did, carried
swords, feather dusters, trays! At one
time I was with George Edwardesâ â "
"Then you sing?" I interupted. s
"I don't know if you would call it
that â ha, ha!" Mr. D'Orsay chuckled,
"Mr. Edwardes jolly wen didn't. Hay
den Coffin did thÂ« singing, don'tcher
know, and we boys marched round tin
uniform."
"I rather suspect you of liking a uni
form. Mr. D'Orsay?"
"Oh, is that fair, now?" the -actor
pleaded. "But do you remember the
uniform of the king in 'A Royal Fam
ily'? Wasn't it a rattier splendid af
fair? Of course, there are some men
that can wear uniforms, and some that
never could, don'tcherknow?" And I
rather think myself that Mr. D'Orsay
numbers that among his accomplish
ments. Which is probably one reason
why Augustus Thomas, who is fitting
the actor with a new play, has made
him a British diplomat at Washington,
D. C. .
"Were you ever," I inquired then in
purposeful slang, " 'up against* Shake
speare?"
" 'Up against!' this dear America!"
the actor murmured. "Yes, I have been
'up against* Shakespeare. They told
me I was very funny in it. I guess I
was, ha, ha! I'm not very fond of
being prinked out in- pale blue stock
ings and pink pumps, you know," this
with comical disgust.
"But in spite of all temptations to
remain a super and to play Dundreary
Shakespeare, you came out all right,"
I prompted.
"Couldn't do anything else," the actor
said, the sweet smile slowly breaking
out again. "I couldn't sink, you know,
with my mother. I was bound to rise.
But 1 had awfly hard times. That's
nothing though. And 1 wouldn't ask
for anything from my people, didn't see
them for years. Then came a time
when people began to call certain parts
â¢D'Orsay' parts, and I began to be
known as a man with a specialty.
Then is when a fellow begins to make
money. He can." Mr. D'Orsay laughed
pridefully. " 'deliver the goods.' " -
The actor loked so comically proud
of the slang that one must needs chime
in with the laugh, and then he went
on: "This American slang is simply
tiptop! It's so jolly expressive. By
Jove, where could you find a cleverer
expression than this? There is a man
that wants to go after a visit, says he
must go. gets up. sits down, gets up
again, but doesn't go â you know his
sort. The other fellow says: 'Well, why
don't you go? There's no string tied
to you!' ha. ha!" .
"And now. seriously." I asked the
actor, "don't you find that having so
marked a personality as yours limits
you in range of parts?"
"Of course, it must to a certain ex
tent." replied the new Dundreary. "And
trading on a personality alone is not
the highest form of art. But I venture
to think that it is impossible to use
successfully a personality unless an
actor knows his art. Dramatize his
personality once, as you say. and out
side of that he 's lost. He must know
how to differentiate around it; how to
accent here more heavily, there more
lightly; how to obscure this and to ex
hibit th- other quality. Take the king
in 'A Royal Family* and Lord Card
ington. for example: The king's man
ners are vastly different, yet the per
sonality is something the same. But

tor. "You remember the Sierra Ne
vadas? Great, beautiful, snow-covered
peaks. And then the gentle, smiling
hills of California. By Jove, it makes
one feel the presence of God. And one
seems nearer there to the longing
that a man always has in his life â but
I don't want to pose as a sentimental
ist. I pose as a humorist." D'Orsay's
sunny laugh lifted up again. "That is
the way with us in England, isn't it?
We don't weep in public, don'tcher
know, and then they think we don't
feel. I'm just thinking of the typical
puardsman. He dawdles through life,
in Hyde Park and the rest, and then
goes to war without a word. He comes
back and begins to dawdle again, and
when some one slaps him on the back
and praises his fighting he just says:
"There is nothing to fuss about. I just
saw a fellow that shouldn't be there
and punched his jaw for him.' Doesn't
gas, you know, does it and says noth
ing. There's perhaps been a girl, too:
and he just says when he comes back:
"By the way, how's so-and-so?'"
Which quaint little picture is quite
the D'Orsay kind of thing. He laugh
ingly acknowledged it afterward, say
ing that he was "jolly glad that other
actors don't take it up, ha, 'ha!"
Of his success as the Earl of Paw
tucket, his first starring venture, and
the result of twenty years' hard work
the actor puts it â he was perhaps
most pleased with the kindness of the
Lambs' Club members about it.
"I'm passionately fond of the club."
he told me, looking it "and every
member of it was just as pleased with
my success as I was. It might have
been different, you know. But if I
had been John Drew himself, or any
of them, they could not have been
more jolly kind. The Lambs' Club
is home to me in New York' â I'm a
bachelor, you know."
"That's interesting," I said.. "I'm
going to tell that to the matinee
girls."
But, alas! before I left Mr. . DOr
say gave me something further and
different to tell. He was proudly
telling me of his ownership of a
plot of land at Mount Carmel, near
Monterey, and thai some day he is
coming to make hi^ home there. And
then, somehow, I learned that there
was to come there. i f all goes well, a
girl for whom hs has "waited all his
life." And simply, sweetly and chival
rously as Cardington speaks of Har
riet, the gentleman befrfe me ' said:
"The girl whose face you see at your
prayers must be the right one?"

MCCOMAS' PICTURES AT VICKERY'S
Fellow citizens, wake up, wake up!
How many of you know that just

made New York sit up and take no

when he unrolled his epics of the night
in their smoky old town?
There's Frank McComasâ Francis J.

Charles Rollo Peters exhibits thirty
two canvases at Claxton's, 213 Post

of Marin mornings, is exhibiting at
Schussler's, 119 Geary street.
And besides these gallery exhibits,
there's Amedee Joullin's salon picture,
with its splendid fellows, to be seen at
his studio, 207 Sansome street. This

an uninteresting part of the exhibit.

As to the McComas exhibit at Vick
ery's, there is this to be said â it is dif
ferent. The pictures, all water colors,
are big, strong, impelling; and whether
they be of California oaks or scenes in
sunny Spain, they all bear the stamp
of individuality.
But how widely the two themes dif
fer! Here is a well-developed pastoral
side â the McComas in California, big,
strong and simple, dwelling in peace
with his Spanish scenes that are infi
nite in detail.
Ye who love old Spain for its im
agery and glamour will pause before
"Gibraltar," "The Bridge of Ronda"
and "A Spanish Afternooi) ' â three dis
tinct types of his work in the land of

In his California scenes â his first
loves â Mr. McComas has grown even as
have the great green oaks that he loves
to paint. But this is but the normal
growth of a mind that dwells with the
oaksâ it must widen to grasp their
grandeur, their vastness. And in a
man of temperament this growth is
steady and unfalteringâ and so must it
be with his work, if he be sincere.

tor has shown himself possessed of
every essential attribute of leadership,
sound musicianship, large magnetism,
brilliant resourcefulness and unfailing
energy. This afternoon the gifted
young director will be heard in a new
field, in which it is said in Milan that
he equals if not excels himself in the
operatic genre in the field of sym
phony. Signor Polacco will have un
der his baton an orchestra of seventy
live men, that includes the Tivoli or

tional players. Tetrazzini will be the
soloist. The programme of the after
noon will be as follows: (a) Prelude,

some time toward th>> end of March.
The singer, during her two years' stay
here this time, has done some admir
able work. Chief amung it is of course
her Santuzza, sung under Mascagnis
direction, a highly musical and very
clever dramatic performance. Madame
Roma's work in the comic opera at the
Tivoli has been throughout valuable,
her Katisha and other such character
performances certainly never having
been bettered if equaled here.
Opportunity to hear the singer in
grand opera roles in which she has
appeared with distinction in England
has not been ours, outside of the San

heard in scenes from some of these
before she leaves, at an operati

when elders enter the room, to relin

card party. But when it becomes
good form to harken with deference
to grandmamma's opinions there's no
telling what will happen to the card
parties that keep things going nowa
days. Girls may have to organize
sewing bees or quilting parties if the
fad of obedience strikes hard in San
Ju^t how our breezy, matter-of-fact,
out-of-door maid is going to tone
down to being polite according to the
old time seminary notions is a prob
lem. But let us hope, in the revolu
tion, that a bapj.y medium be struck
and that delicacy of feeling and con
sideration for others be the stand
ards by whu-h the "good manners"
shall be in< tt-urpd. Good manners
gauged by any other medium are a
sham and a lie and are worn only as
a garment, to bf> put on or off at will.
The true "good manners, " which
we are assured have taken root in New
York, are believed to be of a new type,
neither the old nor the new, but a
happy mingling of both, with the del
icacy and forethought of the old and
the reliance and vigor of the new.
A health to "good manners": Let
v? have them in public places as well
as at home or in society. They help
immensely to make the rough places
smoother and the general scheme of
life happier.

AMERICAN COUNTESS
JOINS AUTO BRIGADE
Former Mfsw Tloweil of South Caro
lina Buys I\\ pensive Machine
in London.
LONDON, Feb. 18. â As the London
season approaches fashionable women
are vying with each other as to who
shall have the smartest motor. The
Countess of Egmont, formerly Miss
PÂ»Will of South Carolina, and hither
to by no means prominent in smart
society, has now joined what is com
monly called the motor brigade. She
has bought a tar of a French pattern,
which is said to have cost at least
% tO, OOO. In luxurious fittings it does
not compare with such cars as those
owned by the Duchess of Marlborough
n the Countess of Craven, but in
mechanism it la guaranteed to possess
all the latest features.
The makers supplied one of their
best engineeca to show the Countess
how to handle the car and she has
shown a facility In acquiring a knowl
edge of the intricacies of its ma
chinery that has astonished her
teacher. She has only been a student
for six weeks and she now handles the
steering gear and the brake as if she
were a veteran driver. She has learned
more in one lesson than any other
woman has done in twelve. v
It is a matter of common talk in the
Automobile Club that American
women show greater boldness in hand
ling motors than their English cousins
and are also much quicker in grasp
ing the details of the mechanism <>f
their cars. It took Queen Alexandra
over two years to acquire sufficient
skill and confidence to handle h â 
and several other English women have
taken from three to four years.

FRANCE WANTS TAMER
FOR SILK SPIDER.
To Train Bug in Madagascar
CANNIBALISM AMONG INSECTS
CHECKS GROWTH OF INDUSTRY
REMARKABLE SILK SPINNING SPIDKH OF MAI>A<;AS<\\R WITH WHICH THE
FRE.V H GOVERNMENT IS ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH iiVT LITTLE BIC
CAUSK THE FEMALES OF THE COLONIES PREY UPON' THE MALE
INSECTS.
PARIS, Feb. 18.â There is an uncom
monly promising sort of a job in the
service of the French Government
waiting for any one who happens to
have just the right qualifications for
filling it.
"Wanted" â such, put into words, is
the desire of the French Colonial office
â"Wanted, a spider-tamer and trainer
j for the silk spinning factory of Mada
i gascar."
On first reading this might be taken
to mean that an overseer was needed
for certain recalcitrant natives, or per
haps an expert to run some queer piece ,
* of machinery. Inquiry, however,
proves that the spiders to be tamed
and trained are genuine insects and
that nothing less than a fortune is in
store for 'the man who can succeed in
disciplining them.
The French Government's ailk spin- 1
ning industry in Madagascar, begun
with bo much promise a few years ago,
[is actually languishing through the
vagaries of the spiders from whom the
silk is obtained. Cursed with the
worst of tempers and possessed of de- |
plorable habits, they have co far de- i
feated all efforts to bring them into
line with modern labor regulations, and ]
, that is why a "spider-trainer" is so j
i ardently sought.
He should, according to accounts, be
B man with a good knowledge of nat
ural history and well up in the ways
of the "halabe," or Madagascar spider.
while having also some knowledge of i
sl!k work management and silk spin- i
ning. The Madagascar spider differs
as much from the domesticated Insect .
as chalk from cheese, and requires a |
i firm hand over it.
FEMALES EAT MALES.
In the first place the snider of Mad- |
agaecar is very much larger than
those we are accustomed to see fight
ing a daily round with the housewife's
broom, the female being, as is often
the ease in the insect kingdom, the
finer of the two, and distinctly the
"better man." She possesses a most
uncertain temper, and her husband,
poor henpecked creature, has a sorry !
time of it.
She will as likely as not, if a little an- '
noyed, pounce on him and devour him !
; before the poor fellow even knows
i where he is. He is pretty sure, unless
! he prefers suicide, to furnish in his '
own form a cold collation for his wife
sooner or later.
This unlovable spirit and hungry
, nature is exactly what makes thi3
spider bo difficult to rear, though great
i efforts are being made to bring it to a
better feeling; for could it only be
tamed to gentler ways and) its canni- I
balism checked, there is little doubt i
that the Madagascar spiderÃ would be '
far more valuable than silkworms.
They are supposed to live on mangos
and the thick groves round Antanan- i
; rlvo, the capital of Madagascar, pro- !
vide a happy home with luscious food, '
where they might live happily and in- j
I crease at ease. But the fighting in- i
; stincts and depraved taste of these mi
i sects for eating one another keeps
their numbers small, and this is at the
bottom of the difficulty of the French
| Colonial Ministry- A
With every desire to foster the silk
spinning industry, the Government, at ;
the suggestion of General Gallieni, has
; founded professional schools for the i
t propagation and cultivation of these '
spiders, and many natives are engaged !
I in the Industry.
BIG YIELD OF SILK.
The spiders when caught in the man
go groves are brought to the native
school by girls in light baskets. Even
here the quarrelsome creatures must 1
not be left too lons alone, or when
the basket is opened it will be a case
of the "lady and the tiger," one only
will be visible, the others will be "in
side" passengers. It will be remem
bered that the spider, unlike the silk
worm, uses its silk to form its web
and not its cocoon. The silk must,
therefore, be drawn from it during life
if an even thread Is to be obtained.
For this purpose Madagascar spi
ders are placed in a curious apparatus
with divisions holding twenty-four at

a time. Each square contains what
may be described as a little guillotine,
or crescent of wood, which firmly grips
the spider. This is -fixed over that
part of the body between the abdomen
and the head. The legs are arranged
on the tHorax, the abdomen thus
emerging on the side whence the silk Is
to be drawn. They must be arranged
with great care so as not to injure
them, and they yield a generous
amc-unt of exquisitely fine filament.
About 12,500 yards of silk can be tak
en from one single insect in a month
in four or five windings. t After this
they die, possibly frc-m overwork, there
being no limit to the laborer's output
in that far island.
The native girls have a very delicate
hand and actually succeed in drawing
the filaments from all the spiders in
the box at the same time. This 18
done by lightly touching each insect
in turn and then withdrawing the
hand, the thread being then led to a
mechanical twister, which in turn
sends it to a rude wheel. The spiders
yield their silk very freely and with
out resistance, and, being naturally
somewhat "run down" in health, after
this operation, are sent to "Spider Park
Sanitarium," where among bamboo
plants specially arranged to form shel
tering bowers they gradually recover.
At the end of a few days of convales
cence those who have not formed part
of the menu of their companions return
to business and to yield more silk.
BRILLIANT THREADS.
The thread thus obtained from the
halabe is of a marvelous color and
quality. No gold was ever more bril
liant, no yellow ever so pure. Its ex
treme fineness and elasticity, far ex
celling that of ordinary silk, allows it
to be woven into tissues of extraor
dinary suppleness, yet solid enough to
stand the wear at ages. Visitors to the
colonial section of the last Paris ex
hibition will remember in the Madagas
car show some bed hangings made of
this wonderful silk, which delighted
and astonished all beholders. Several
of the spiders were also to be seen at
work.
The only difficulty is the smallness
of the output, and that is the result
of the ill training of the spiders. They
have not yet really learned that this
is an age when all must labor for the
universal benefit. As far back as 1710
the great Reamur experimented with a
modest French spider, cousin of thÂ«
Madagascar spinner, but it waa found
that it would require 700.0U0 of the lit
tle creatures to *-leld even a pound of
silk. It was a Roman Catholic priest
who observed the beautiful yellow
threads that hung on the mango groves
round Antananrlvo, and who practic
ally started the Industry of to-day,
using small match boxes to hold the
insects while drawing the thread, on
the game principle as the present ap
paratus.
The quality and color of the Mad
agascar spider's silk make it extremely
valuable, and there is no doubt that
could sufficient be obtained a high fig
ure could be commanded. The French
Government Is anxious to give the in
dustry every encouragement, and it
only needs the spider tamer.

REFORM IN CITY POLITICS.
THE conviction of a second ballot-box stuffer and other events in
the nature of disclosures affecting the government of the city
keep in focus the necessity of the large majority of good people
gelling together to effect needed reforms. This cannot be done un
less they gel together. The burden of prosecuting these criminals
who corrupted the ballot-box has fallen upon a few gentlemen who
had the courage to see that the law is enforced. It is true that they
had the sympathy and support of one organization, the Merchants'
iation, but, outside of that, good citizens have been content to
read of results in the newspapers, and be glad that something has
D <1< Hit 1 .
That, however, is insufficient. The crimes that were committed
and have been punished by conviction of the criminals were the out
growth of a system that is always organized and ready for criminal
action as soon as and whenever vigilance is relaxed. The political
"push" is a self-perpetuating corporation ; it has perpetual succession,
and forms on the body politic, when the people are indifferent, just
as naturally as mold forms in damp places, which would be whole
some if reached by the air and sunshine. To offset this it is neces
sary that there should be an equally permanent organization of the
decent elements of the city. They are not organized when they are
divided between two political parties. They are only playing into
the hands of the push when they separate in the support of two party
tickets. With the push are found ambitious politicians, who have
more or less effective control of both party organizations, and these,
with great plausibility, insist upon "regularity' 7 in the support of
party tickets. When they secure this their part has been played and
the push does the rest. *
\ weekly paper of standing and influence has criticized The Call
initiating this movement for a city government on a non-partisan
ba-i>. that can be supported by all citizens who have at heart the
best interests of San Francisco. Our critic reminds us that the last
election showed this to be a Republican city, and inferentially insists
that the proper course in municipal politics is to follow party lines.
What evidence is there that in municipal politics San Francisco is a
Republican city? How long is it since we had a Republican Mayor?
Horn long is it since the party that carries the city in general elec
l in it in a city election?
We think the evidence is clear that men do a 'great deal of non
partisan voting at general elections and the candidacies of McKinley
and Roosevelt appealed to these independent voters, causing a prac
tical alliance at the general elections which we desire to see brought
â bout in the next city campaign. Experience shows that this cannot
be done by supporting party tickets. Some one must initiate and
many must promote a movement that will secure for a right city
ticket the same favor of independent voters that has been shown for
McKinley and Roosevelt.
The Call desires only to point out the way and follow others in
taking it. If now a considerable number of citizens, working
onh in the interest of the city, would combine, decide the steps to
be taken and put the movement in the hands of a committee of such '
citizens as have just vindicated the law in the case of the ballot-box
Ters. the movement so started would gather strength that would
be irresistible at the polls next November.
Such a movement must be free 6f personal ambition. Tf it find
the right men for candidates and have to draft them into the service,
much the better. If they feel that they are making a sacrifice.
much the better. They will do their duty in office without think
ing of rewards beyond. We want none who will use the power I
given them lor Â£<*>d government to put themselves in line for fur
ther preferment. We want men who are content to do their duty
in the places where they are put by the people. If these principles
are observed ii will be seen that a city government that has behind
it the combined local patriotism and cleanness of San Francisco can J
give the city an impetus that will last a long time and be felt far i
into the fmure. We are persuaded that such a government will set
the pace and furnish an example that will even affect favorably a
baton partisan city officiary. If the people once feel the effect o\
such* a government they will not permit a return to old methods ami
offensive practices in any event.
There i> such a general feeling of the necessity for such a move
ment that The Call desires to crystallize it into action now. If it i<
there is only folly and failure in waiting until the issue is
imminent. Such a committee as we have suggested would ha\
month- <Â«i earnest work in the scanning of men and the selection
rom which ultimate choice is to be made. This work
mot be done in a hurry. It cannot be well clone after *he quasi
resnectable agents of the push have adroitly put men under the
obligation of a promise. Tt must be done while the political pool
uiet and undisturbed, and before the chords of personal ambition
have been cunningly touched by the tempter. We are willing to
ntintie t ; ggestions as long as the feeling is abroad that
action upon them is necessary. That is as far as a newspaper can
The people must take up the work and see that it is not permit
ingnish.
QUESTIONABLE LEGISLATION.
THE bill passed by the House at Sacramento admitting law
graduates of a private institution to practice on their diplomas
ami without further examination or action by a judicial court
i- very questionable legislation. An attorney is an officer of the
Tt. and if any private institution, over which the State has no
jurisdiction, can send its graduates into court on their diplomas
only, a bad precedent i> established.
The entry upon the professions of law and medicine instead
being made easier than now should be made more difficult. They
very directly concern the public welfare and their practice should
be intrusted only to the well trained, whose natural tastes lead them
that \va\. As it is now we have too many lawyers and doctors
who adopt their profession as a matter of necessity. They want to
do something and are lured by the social position that goes with a
learned profession, rather than led by a natural fitness.
It is for thi< reason that there are so many in both professions
who live by their practices rather than by their practice. They
overcrowd the professions and supply the odium in which law and
â me are sometimes held.
The legislation mentioned is special and should not be the lav.
There iÂ« but little evidence that its merit? were considered at all. j
it seems to have been the subject of purely personal considera
tions in its passage. The law student who cannot afford to attend
a school, but who feels drawn to the profession and equips himself
by hard study, has to go before a court for examination of his quali
fications for admission to the bar. The student of law in a private
institution should enjoy no advantage over him. The bill is a good
one for the Senate to kill or for the Governor to veto.
OCEANSIDE SALOON LICENSES.
THE residents of the rapidly growing district of Oceanside have
taken serious issue with the Board of Police Commissioners in
the matter of the establishment of more saloons in their vicinity,
and from all accounts much of the merit of the question seems to be
on their side. They claim that in response to a letter they were
promised by the board that no more saloon licenses would be
granted on the Ocean Driveway without notifying them to appear
and discus the application, yet, in the face of such promise, they say
the board has broken faith and granted licenses to two downtown
saloons with the privilege of transfer to the Ocean Boulevard.
At a meeting of the Oceanside Improvement Club held on Tues
day evening to protest against the action of the board, many tax
payers of the distVict, both ladies and gentlemen, appeared and ably
defended the right to maintain their homes unsullied from the con
taminating influences of the saloon.
There is no good reason why the wishes of the majority of the
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, FEBRUARY 19. 1905.
CUPID OF MODERN DAYS
HAS DETERIORATED.
Dorothy Fenimore
CUPID has deteriorated. Once he
was a god. Now he is a cute
little valentine ornament, or a
prince of archers. To-day he is
a target for anybody who feels
like firing a rhyme at him. The only
pre-eminence which he has saved from
the wreck of the rich prospectK of his
youth is unlimited publicity. Royalty's
picture is published less frequently
than his.
In the Greek anthology there is a
fragment of a delightful little poem,
supposed to be by Plato, which pre*'
sents a really beautiful picture of the
god of love as he lies asleep among
tho^ roses, with the brown bees settling
on his smiling lips to leave their honey
there.
And thus Walter Pater, who of all
moderns is most Greek in spirit, de
scribes Love, as the youth appears to
his girl-wife Psyche when she sees
him by the fateful lamp â whose flame
at very sight of him kindles more
gladly:
"She sees the locks of that golden
head, pleasant with the unction of the
gods, shed down in graceful entangle
ment behind and before, about the
ruddy cheeks and white throat. The
pinions of the winged god, yet fresh
with the dew, are spotless upon his
shoulders, the delicate plumage wav
ering over them as they lie at rest.
Smooth he was, and touched with
light, worthy of Venus, his mother.
At the foot of the couch lay his bow
and arrows, the instruments of his
power, propitious to men."
Contrast with these exquisite vis
ions, which adorn the beautiful words
that portray them, the Cupid whom
we know to-day â a rachitic infant,
who looks as if he had been brought
up on a patent baby food which was
not good for his constitution. On his
back are hingeless wings that are in
variably either too big for him or top
little. Of all precociou infants he
most needs medical attention and a
mother's guiding tenderness. He
smokes, plays golf, toboggans â in fact,
does everything that is sporty, up
to-date, and in season, except wearing
furs in winter.
Sometimes he appears playing horse,
driven by_ a beauteous damsel in a ball
gown, who does not seem to be in the
least embarrassed by his ingenuous
disregard of the conventions which
prescribe full dress for evening wear.
Certainly this is not the gleaming
god of the shining bow and quiver,
ho who used to weigh down the eye
lashes of maidens, with tears fair aa
dewdrops on the fringes of "a flower â
he who touched the soul of man with
a fire immortal which burned to bless,
or burned to ruin.
This is not the poet god who, see
inp a milk-white flower growing upon
the plain, lovely as gentleness, but so
unpretentious that people passed its
bfauty by, unheeding, shot into its
heart a bolt of gold that turned its
pallor purple with Love's wounds, so
that ever after maiden stooped to
THE OLD-TIMER.
I'M weary of paint and powder,
I'm weary of eyebrows and curls.
And the busy soubrette who sings louder
Than all of the rest of the girls.
And my fancy turns to the past to dwell
On the lassie who used to recite
The story they tell
Of the curfew bell
Forbidden to ring to-night.
!:n tired of the leading lady.
With the frown and the alto voice.
'. .1 the past that's described as shady
N"o more can my heart rejoice.
T<> that curfew lassie â the village pride â
My memory once more inclines,
Who sweetly tried,
And who almost cried.
Because she forgot her lines.
No queen of the drama is half so fair
As the star of that night, in sooth:
There is none with such gold in her waving hair
And none with such artless youth.
And how I resent each ruthless year
That curtains the scenes of old!
I'd pay right dear
For a place to hear
That tale of the curfew told.
residents of that section of the city, whom the board were ap
oointed to represent as well as any other section, should not be
considered, and the father unusual feature of the ladies of the *lis
trict being compelled to address the meeting in an appeal for their
homes brings the matter into sharper focus for public discussion.
If the taxpaying residents of Oceanside do not wish saloons, such
places should not be foisted upon them. If the saloons are not pa
tronized by neighbors, they must, in order to exist, receive their pa
tronage from the outside, and the former should not be made to suffer
to accommodate the thirst of transient roysterers from afar who j
wish to exhaust their surplus vitality under cover of the night and :
make the peaceful name of the old ocean a misnomer.
Under a general view of the case there would seem to be
enough saloons at present on the oceanside to slake the thirst of all ;
who need them. Even under ordinary conditions great care ,should
be used in considering applications for any more licenses for a f]U3r
ter of the city largely devoted to residences. There are those who
have been induced to build homes there who are not always delirious !
for amusement and excitement, but who would be satisfied wi+h a
less hysterical condition than could be brought about by decoiating j
the ocean with a fringe of groggeries. Tt is therefore just and proper I
that the board should abide by the wishes of the majority interested i
when considering the granting of saloon licenses.

What would Venus say if she could
see her darling now? Of course, ac
cording to mortal standards, she was
ntver especially motherly. But she
had ambitions for her son. And she
had also a frank habit of speaking her
mind. And if she did not give Cupid
pocket money, so that in consequence
he has always had a reputation for be
ing out at the elbows, it was certainly
t.o fault of hers, considering his taste
in dress.
I think that she would say to him
something like this: "My son, it is

WHAT MAKES
THE SKY
BLUE?
The sky has long been a puzzle to
physicists. There are two mysteries to
explain about itâ its reflection of light
and its color. The old view was that
the blue of the sky was due simply to
atmospheric oxygen. Oxygen has a
faint blue tint and the idea was that
several miles of the gas. even when
diluted as it i<= in the air, would have
a bright blue color. But this did not
account for the intense illumination of
the sky, and of recent years Tyndall's
"dust theory," or some modification of
it, has been generally accepted. This
regards the blue color as an optical ef
fect, like the color of very thin smoke,
due to excessively fine particles float
ing in the air, which would also ac
count for the large proportion of re
flected light from the. sky. Recent cal
culations by Professor Spring of Liege,
Belgium, however, indicate that the
dust in the air is not sufficient in
amount nor finely enough divided to
support this explanation and he rejects
it for this and other reasons. He has
gone back to the old oxygen theory
and accounts for the general illumina
tion of the sky on the hypothesis first
advanced by Hagenbach that, inter
mingled layers of different density in
the atmosphere give it the power of re
flecting light. â Success Magazine.
QUEER WEATHER SIGNS.
Country people have a great con
tempt for those who cannot tell what
the weather is going to be till they
have looked at their expensive bar
ometers or seen the weather indications
in the morning papers. They have so
many simple ways of finding out what
they wish to know about the weather
and are so accustomed to doing this
that they make the observations al
most mechanically. Ask one of them
how to do this and he will give you a
long list of simple weather gauges.
For instance, if you are a smoker,
look at your cigar tip. If it burns with
a clear, red glow the day will be tine,
but if it has a charred end that re
fuses to burn brightly take your um
brella. If a slipper creaks, it is sure
to be fine; if it is silent, it will be
damp. In damp weather newspapers
are easily torn, gloves contract and
are difficult to put on, matches will not
light easily, silk hats become dull, awn
ing cords are tight, boot laces snap
and a sccre of inanimate things tell to
the initiated that there is rain to come.

COMMON SENSE.
A writer in Harper's Weekly makes a
pjea for the limitation of "common
sense," . which, he claims, while pre
serving us from cranks, fools and
cheats, is hurtful to us as a nation.
"Common sense" has made us "the
must practical, the most inventive, the
most mechanical people on earth. " But
we are particularly devoid of enthusi
asm, which has always been made the
butt of common sense; and genius is
a product of enthusiasm. "As a nation,
no have produced fewer goniuses than
any other nation of first or second
rate. If we desire great geniuses
for our land we must cease counsel
ing" common sunse;" for "to take pairis
to be common â to have the common
sense of the multitude â means to rein
in power of accomplishment."
CURE FOR LAZINESS.
Th^> Hollanders are not fond of lazy
people, and they have a good way of

work. If a pauper who is able to work
refuses to do so they put him in a
cistern, to which a pump is attached,
and turn on a stream of water. The
stream flows into the cistern just
slowly enough to enable the lazy per
son, by lively pumping to keep the
water from getting up over his head. â

THE short winter afternoon was
hawing to a close when the two
riders swung their horses into
the bridle path that led back to
the city. The sun had gone down
behind a ragged line of hills across
the river, and the low hanging clouds
in the west were edged with crimson
and ocher. The air was keen and
frosty; now and then a gust of wind
set the bare branches of the elms
above their heads rattling shiveringly:
far away in the east a solitary star
twinkled uncertainly in the pale blue
sky.
Max Fenn pulled his horse into a
walk and as Miss Dale also drew rein
she turned to the young man with a
smiling protest.
He leaned toward her In the 1
saddle.
"Really, we must hurry." she said
uneasily. "It's getting late."
"No," he said slowly; "I can't
hurry. This last stretch means too
much to me. It's only two miles to
the end."
"The end of the bridle path?" she
asked, with becoming innocence.
"The end of the world," he said
lugubriously.
The girl's face flushed. Her eyes
were intent on the handle of her
hunting crop.
"Oh, surely, it's not that," she said
nervously.
"Surely it's just that â to me," he
replied.
You're making a mountain out of
a mole hill," she said with an inef
fectual attempt at light-heartedness.
"So I feared." he returned dryly.
"We really must hurry, Mr. Fenn,"
she said again.
"See here," said he, "if you knew a
man who was about to be hanged
you'd treat 4ifti the best you knew
how â grant all his little foolish re
quesst â until the hanging, wouldn't
you ?"
"I suppose so." she admitted.
"Well,'.' ho went on. "I'm about to I
undergo an ordeal beside which to be
hanged is a luxury. In the light of my
unfortunate predicament, won't you
agree to walk the horses until we
reach the city? You certainly don't
begrudge me those added few min

In other generations she worked. With
the introduction of machinery and of

avocation has been taken from her. A
large part of the work which was once
hers is now done oÂ»*tside of the house.
Once she made clothes and even wove
the cloth from which she fashioned
garments. She went into the garden
and raised vegetables; she milked the
cows. There *was a time when the
farmers sneered at the man who
milked. A woman always did that. I
have traveled extensively through
farming districts of the West without
even having seen a farmer's wife milk
a cow.
Formerly the woman was the man's
industrial partner. Her work now has
gone out of the home and nothing re
mains for her but to leave the home in
search of it. There is no use for her
to waste her time in trying to do that
which is now being better and more
cheaply done by other means.

Paradise, which not infrequently fade
into mist before its eyes. Along with
Rabbi Ben Ezra, in Browning, ours is
an age to say "Rather I prize the

concept of the men of the present
day," sa-id the professor, "with regard
to their wives. Through all classes of
society extends the idoa that the
woman is a doll. Everything tends to
relieve her of her share of the work and
to make her one of the leisure class.
Formerly this leisure class of women
included only the aristocracy.
"Now those of the capitalistic class
who were once large producers have
become non-producers and are imitat
ing the ideas which were once
held only by the aristocracy. The wife
of the man who belonged to the money
ed class was hard headed and saving
and she helped her husband build up
his fortune. The acquisition of the
ideals once held by the aristocracy has
reached even to the working classes, so
that a man earning only $10 a week
will object to his wife doing her share,
on the ground that her doing so would
give the impre^gon that he was not
able to support her. It is the spread
of such ideals which has shut out a
large class from production.
"Everywhere we see the tendency for
women to go into this leisure class.
The wives of men of moderate means
devote their time to dress, to travel,
to attending the meetings of women's
clubs, in going to balls, dinner parties,
theaters and bridge whist parties.
BLOW TO POPULATION.
"That means a falling: off of popu-
lation. It cannot have any other ef
fect. The woman who has no work
has no children, because she does not
wish to be bothered with them. She
does not care for home. All her # in
terests are outside of it. On the other
hand the woman who toils does so for
the purpose of increasing the family
income so that she may help build up
the home. She has four or five chil
dren where the woman of the leisure
class has none. History shows that
the mothers of the most children were
working women.
"My attention," continued the pro
fessor, "was called to this question by
the general consideration of the sub
ject of wages. How shall we use the
surplus? By having the woman work
or by extending the period of child
hood. The man must determine
whether he will take the child out of
school or take his wife out of work.
The tendency now is to prolong the
time children shall be free from toil.
"In some States the age at which
children must remain in school is 14
years. It should be 18. The hours of
work for the mother should be coinci
dent with those of her children in
school."
FAMILY'S PROGRAMME.
Professor Patten then outlined a
day for a family of father, mother and
children under the proposed regime.
"All would arise at about half past
6 o'clock," he began, "and the busi
ness of the day would begin. The
mother would, of course, prepare the
breakfast, and in these days of break
fast food ready made that could be
easily done. The preparation of the
aVerage breakfast takes but fifteen
minutes. As to the washing of the
dishes that is left in such households

to start a little earlier than the rest of

eye of honest doubt, admitting what
ever truth there may be in the need of
a physical base for things higher, the
fact remains that to thousands of hun
gry and thirsty souls, to-day, the clear
notes of the surely advancing Age of
Faith are much more gratifying and
humanly satisfying beyond all the
questionings of doubt as the inspiring
mystic melodies of one old Stradivarius
violin are more heart pleasing than the
music of all the other instruments in a
great orchestra together, and as sure

complete and necessary as truth itself.

j since it is the organ of the unseen as

Then, Faith holds to-morrow in its

The spirit of .the age is the spirit of

Men do not choose the proper type of women. There is
where so much of the trouble lies.
the family. The hours aurihp which
the mother is to work vill, of course,
have to be determined later. Six hours,
as I have said, would be sufficient. On
her return she could look after the din
ner.
"The luncheon for the children, you
say? Well, they could tafce that with
them. I fancy that the day is not far
distant when hot luncheons will be
served to children in the schools, as it
is in European countries. We are ap
proaching that idea now. The dinner
for the evening could be made up of
dishes purchased at establishments re
sembling delicatessen stores. Much of
the foofl which is prepared In the
kitchens of the laboring classes is bad
ly cooked and is of low nutritive value.
When I was in Paris recently I was
surprised to see the number of shops
where well cooked food, such as roasts
and joints, could be purchased ready
for the table. The whole idea which I
propose is this: To take the wife away
from the home, where she is often an
inefficient agent, and to make it poscl
ble for her to do work where she will
produce something' of value and add
substantially to the family income.
The trouble with conditions of labor at
present is that the hours are set en
tirely for men. Of course there would
have to be some changes to accommo
date the women. There might be two
shifts of the feminine workers. Part of
them might be at home while the
others are at work in the fectory. Re
lieved of much of the cooking, the wife
could find time to do some of the light
cleaning work about the house, or her
wages might be sufficient 'to permit oc
casionally the hiring of a cleaning wo

men who have no Faith to-morrow is
a fatal necessity â and a will-o'-the
wisp none the less. The materialist's
to-morrow, the commercialist's, those
who seek the "bubble reputation at the

Tantalus it is? "A year hence, ten
years, twenty years from now, I shall
be rich, famous, successful." How
many are? The to-morrow of unfaith
for the most part never comes, yet it
must build on its fateful castles ever.
Faith's to-morrow, on the contrary,
never deceives. It is a sun that shines
the brightest when the candle if to
day is dimmest, that flashes fullest at
to-day's eventide, sending back rays of
richest splendor, just as to-day's light
has completely faded into night, and
rises on a to-morrow that never sets.
And then the to-day that want of
faith seems to have. Is it really worth
while? Does the sordid success of the
chaser after mere material good really
please? Is there not illusion in it?

SOME ADVANTAGES.
"That meant deception. If the woman
became a factor In the industrial sys
tem of the country many of the faults
to which she is subject would disap
pear. She would be truthful, honest
and punctual, would she not? The lack
of punctuality would at first put her
under disadvantages. Punctuality is an
industrial quality. Men soon acquire it,
because they have to do so.
"Men must keep their word. They
learn the value of that in business, for
out of commerce comes the square
deal."
"Doctor," was asked, "is it not true
that there are many men who do not
care to marry an independent, re
sourceful wife who is abundantly able
to make her own living?"
"It may be," replied the doctor, "that
the ordinary man does not wish an in
dependent kind of wife. He prefers the
picture kind of a woman. He does not
consider the matter of intellect. I knew
once of a man who when he was asked
why he had chosen so frivolous a wife
replied that it made no difference to him
â he had brains enough for two. Such
a marriage as that must prove unfor
tunate. How can the world progress
under such ideas as that? Men do not
choose the proper type of woman.
There is where so much of the trouble
I lies. They seek women who will be di
â  version for their lighter hours. Empha-
I sis seems to be put upon the poorer
type of woman. In Drimitive times
'women who could not fairly fight
against the world could not succeed.
The strong woman survived. You will
remember that the girl babies were ex
: posed to the weather, and the result
was the perpetuation of the best type
1 of children.
Are not the best of life's substantial
joys those of trust and confidence and
love and hope, all the fair children of
Faith? Is the agnostic to-day un
haunted by evil dreams?
In every way Faith has the advan
tage over doubt â having promise not
only of the life that now is, but that
which is to come. The values of real
worth in time are all faith values, and
is nothing really worth while which is
not of faith. The signs of the times all
point to a renaissance of faith. The
pendulum of the age moving towards
MENUS AND MORALS
THE Immorality which lurks be
hind the most tastefully pre
pared menu of modern times
was the text upon which Canon
Lyttelton based an address to the
members of the Moral Education So
ciety at Manchester recently.
The canon is a vegetarian, and he
declared his emphatic agreement with
Tolstoy, who contends that it is well
nigh impossible for even the best in
tentioned man to live a life of physical
purity if he eats meat to excess.
"As soon as the diet is changed
from meat to vegetables there is a
diminution in animal Just," continued
Canon Lyttelton. "The menus of the
well-to-do are on the topsy-turvy
system. Instead of being so arranged
as to appease hunger they stimulate
appetite. If the cheese and the sweets
"This question of the physical quali
ties of women is an important one. All
the authorities agree that so far as
progress is concerned man is at a
standstill so far as his physical pow
ers are concerned. The time will come,
no doubt, when there will be scien
tific marriages in order to strengthen
the human race and to send it .on the
road to progress. Industrial conditions
should lead to the progress of both
men and women. The woman who has
borne her portion of the industrial bur
den is certainly better fitted for moth
erhood than the one who has not. She
has built herself up in muscles and
nerves. Fhe is devoid of the nervous
weakness so peculiar to women of the
leisure class. In addition to that, she
has built up character and high qual
ities, which the woman who has not
had contact with industrial conditions
is not likely to possess. As supplement
ing a college course, I know of no bet
ter training to flt a young woman for
the responsibilities of life than four or
five years spent in useful work."
VIEWS ON MARRIAGE.
Dr. Patten, to use a scientific term,
has a different conception than have
many men with regard to the condi
tions under which young men and
young women should marry.
"There is at present," said he, "a
tendency for those who are engaged to
postpone marriage from year to year
until the husband is better able to pro
vide a home. Take, for instance, the
case of a young man who is earning $35
a week and a young woman stenog
rapher whose weekly stipend is $IS.
They may postpone their marriage. He
meanwhile may be saving up some
money, but spending his days in more
or less extravagance, while she, as the
independent woman usually does, saves
little or nothing. They have what they
call a good time. They go to parties
and. balls. At the end of five years is
the material pole of its great arc has
reached the furthermost point and is
now swinging back rapidly in the
direction of things of the Spirit. The
change was urgent and ' is timely.
There is a vast amount of new knowl
edge to be spiritualized. The splendid
triumphs of science and art and in
vention and learning which distin
guish ours beyond almost any age wait
to be glorified in an age of faith.
Utilitarian ethics viewed merely as a
blossoming of the cosmic process are
without power to secure moral ends.
came first far less meat would be
eaten.
"Schoolboys do not understand the
principles of modern menus, as they
eat as much as they want in the first
quarter of an hour and then 'stuff'
themselves for the rest of Â£he meal."
Every single meal taken according
to a modern menu, says the canon,
was a direct stimulus to passion.
"One grand result of the Russo-
Japanese war is that we are begin
ning to think seriously about diet." he
continued, "because the Japs, who
eat no meat, are proving their prowess
so plainly. But there will have to be
several more wars before we can do
much about it."
Canon Lyttelton does not believe
in the innocence which is simply
based on ignorance. Unlike George
Meredith's baronet in "The Ordeal of
either of them any better for it? They
have postponed the marriage, which
should have taken place when they
were much younger. How much more
sensible it would be for them to marry
while both are receiving wages! The
total of $43 a week is a comfortable
sum. They could jointly get along very
well on it and be happy. Each would
contribute a share to the maintenance
of the establishment. Is that not bet
ter than for the young woman who
has had $18 a week and has spent it all
to try to make $25 a week do for two?
"It is a good rule to adopt that the
two shall work until the earnings of the
husband shall be equal to the amount
which he and his wife together were re
ceiving at the time of their marriage.
In the case I have mentioned that
would.be $43. The woman could then
withdraw from industry, for by that
time her family is likely to require at
tention. She will, if she has a large
family, then have enough work to do
to Justify her staying at home. That
would be about the time her second
child was born, supposing ' that she
had four or five. Women should marry
between the ages of 20 and 25 years, and
in the course of ten years they would
be relieved from working."
Here is a sample weekly budget pre
pared by the professor for one of ' the
double-headed households which he has
: in mind:
! FAMILY BUDGETâ ANNUAL INCOME. $800.
Father's earnings, $10. Mother's earnings, $8.
i - Father's share. Mother's share.
His own support. Her own support.
Support of children. Care of children.
Pent. Care of house.
Savins. . Preparation of food.
Education. House furnishing.
Recreation.
: Amusement.
BURDENS.
The burden of mate- The burden of mother
rial prosperity. hood.
"In this budget," said Dr. Patten,
"you see that I have placed the items
which the father and the mother . are
supposed to furnish opposite each
other. While the mother is working
the father has an opportunity to save
up money against the time when the
mother will be withdrawn from work.
It is his duty to- provide for education,
recreation and amusement, which are
all really embraced under the term
education. Of this weekly budget the
wife should be the distributing agent.
For the purposes oÂ£ the / household she
should have at least -$12 a week. It
has been suggested that such a house
hold would have two heads, or that
the woman would be really the power.
I - would say. rather, that the home
would be ruled by a king and a prime
minister. The wife is, as she should be,
the administrative officer â prime
minister â she is saving and econom
ical. I see no reason, although in the
case I have given the amounts are
small, why she should not have an
i Easter bonnet Sr something of that
kind out of the ( household budget oc
casionally. â¢
1 "The woman should have an allow
ance for running the house, for it
teaches her qualities of business and
administration. When she takes her
share in providing the revenue for the
household she becomes an efficient fac
tor in the progress of the race."
The ideal life is inspirational. The
model city, the true state, the democ
racy of worth, are first unseen save
by the Â«ye of faith, are built upon
religious foundations, or in another
figure come down out of heaven. There
may bte "more faith in honest doubt
than half the creeds," or there may not
be; but there is more and value
and heart comfort and world uplift
in one grain of honest faith by far.
"We have but faith, we cannot know
For knowledge is of things we see,
And yet we trust it comes from thee
A beam in darkness, let it grow."
Richard Feverel." he does not think
that the one fact in life that human*
beings must not attempt to compre
hend is the origin of life itself.
"A revelation should be made to
youth of all its potentialities and pur
poses," declared the canon, "to be
made so simply and so fully that
there shall be no cranny left wherein
curiosity may pry.
"Girls and boys must also be taught
the wisdom of bridling their appetites
in eating and drinking. In the mat
ter of drinking intoxicants the wo.id
is agreed, but the present danger lies
in the continuance of thÂ» dense, dark
abyss of ignorance of food."
In conclusion Canon Lyttelton said
he anticipated that one day there
would be as great a reform in public
opinion on the question of food as
there had been during the laft half
century regarding intoxicant*

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY. FEBRUARY 19. 1905.
DOES NOT LIKE
SURROUNDINGS
Lee Look Prefers Quiet of
Santa Clara County Jail
to Life of San Quentin
OLD AGE MAY KILL HIM
Murderous 3iongolian Finds
His Tong Brothers Ready
to Save Him at Any Cost
Lee Look, tho San Jose Chinese high
tinder and murderer, seems to have
a good chance of living to ,# ripe old
age in spite cf the fact that he has
thrhe been sentenced to death. He has
been In San Quentin for the last six
weeks, but the climate of the place
;;nd the accommodations do not suit
his fastidious taste, so he has asked
the Suproire '\>urt to let him return
iÂ«- comfortable (iuarters in the Santa
Clara County Jail. Chief Justice Be
.â¢itty hsj? directed that Lee be brought
into court to-morrow morning.
The prisoner murdered L?e Wing, a
fellow country man, in San Jose five
yoars apo durinc the course of a high
binder war. When Lee Look was ar
rested frÂ«is tong raised money for the
defense, and it has cost the murderous
organisation a pretty penny to keep
the assassin's cerebral vertebrae in
position.
At the first trial Lee Look was con
victed, but the Supreme Court reversed
the lower court because the informa
tion had not charged the prisoner with
killing n human bein?. Another con
victior. was nullified because of further
technical errors. A third conviction
w*s sustained by the Supreme Court.
The mattor was then taken to the
United States Supreme Court on a
vrit of Â»rror. After a long delay the
writ was denied. Lee came up smiling
blandly for his third sentence to death.
Then Attorney H. Jarman, repre
senting the prisoner, went to Washing
t< n, D. <.. and showed Justice Mc-
Kenna that technical errors had been
made in his client's case. Lee Look
nas giver another lease of lite, and
the Sheriff of Santu Clara County was
instructed to bring his prisoner to
Washington on March 6 of this year.
Under favorable circumstances the
Chinese should hear from this proceed
ing early in 1907.
Meanwhile the Sheriff grew sick of |
seeing Lee Look's expansive smile and j
carried him over to dan Quentin to '
amuse Warden Tompkins Lee became j
home&ick, however, and decided to go j
back to San Jose. Attorney Jarman i
therefore told Chief Justice Beatty that !
the Sheriff had no right to relinquish !
custody of the prisoner while an ap- j
peal was pending in the United States j
Supreme Court, and the State Supreme |
Court will see if this claim is justified
in to-morrow's hearing.
SAYS HER HUSBAND IS TO
BLAME FOR HER BAD HABITS
Wife of SaJoon-Recpcr Files Affidavit
Charging Him With Responsibil
ity for Her Immoral Acts.
Mary C. Bowers, wife of John P.
Bowers, proprietor of the Ramona sa- j
loon, who was awarded $50 a month
for her support pending the trial of !
her suit for $100 a month for sepa- j
rate maintenance, met her husband's j
motion for a dissolution of the injunc- I
tion tying up his money and property
by an affidavit which blames him for j
her bad hibts. She says that soon af- }
ter they were married in July, 1903, !
he sent her to St. Helena to manage j
the Stone Bridge saloon, an immoral ;
resort, and there she acquired the j
habit of drinking, smoking and using j
vile language. She also says that the '
earnings of her illicit business were j
given to him. Judge Kerrigan re- j
leased half of Bowers' money in bank,
amounting to $685, from the opera
tion of the injunction.
Suit for divorce was filed yesterday !
by Moritz Abramowitz against his J
wife, Tony, and he says that though J
they have lived together under the j
same roof, they have not spoken a i
word since December 15 and have not j
eaten their meals at the same table.
He says she has declared that "she de
tested him more day by day."
Other suits for separation were bÂ»
gun by Gussie V. Goldman against Jo
seph Goldman, cruelty; George Ebe
against Lottie Ebe, cruelty, and Gio- i
vanni Cima against Wilhelmine Cima, j
cruelty. In the Ebe case the husband i
charges that his wife left home for a!'
week in company with a man named '
William Raber, but he condoned her ;
offense upon her promise to be good ;
in the future. He says, however, that j
her subsequent actions prove that she
made the agreement in bad faith.

mous American Document
WASHINGTON. Feb. 18.â Colonel \
William H. Michael, chief clerk of the
State Department, by order of Con- ;
Kress, has published a book, giving an ,
illustrated history of the Declaration
of Independence with the biographies
and portraits of the signers and the
Secretary of the Congress. The ad
vance coDies of this work have been
received at the department. The illus
trations include not only photographs
of the famous state paper in its present
decayed condition, but also a number
of photographs taken when the docu
ment was in a better state of preser
vation.
The volume was prepared primarily
as an aid to those in charge of the ex
hibit of the Department of State at
expositions in explaining that part of
the exhibit relating to the Declaration
of Independence. The series of por
traits of the signers is complete and
there is an interesting fac-simile of
the broadside copy of the Declaration
signed by John Hancock, President of
the Congress for and on behalf of the
members of Congress, attested by
Charles Thomson, Secretary.
Especially interesting is the cor
respondence relating to the Declara
tion, which is given. Because of the
historic value of the work of Colonel
Michael, Congress ordered the book
printed as a Government publication.

ELECTION BOARD
IS ARRAIGNED
Demurrer and Motions Are
Filed With the Object of
Quashing the Proceedings
SEVERAL POINTS EAISED
Allege That Court Has Xo
Jurisdiction and That Sole
Power 'Is Vested in Mayor
The Election Commissioners, ac
cused by the Grand Jury of malfeas
ance in office, appeared before Judge
Lawlor yesterday afternoon and were
arraigned. When asked to plead their
attorney, T. V. Cator, filed a demurrer
to the accusation and two motions,
one to dismiss and the other to ar
rest the proceedings.
In the demurrer it is alleged that
the court has no jurisdiction, because
the power to remove the defendants
from office Is solely vested in the
Mayor by the charter and that the
facts alleged do not constitute a pub
lice offense.
In the motion to dismiss the points
are advanced that the accusation was
not legally found or presented and that
prior to the finding of the accusation
the defendants were compelled to go
before the Grand Jugy and testify to
the matters charged against tljem in
the accusation.
In the motion to arrest the proceed
ings the allegation is made that the
court has no jurisdiction, inasmuch
as prior to January 17, the date on
which the accusation against the de
fendants was filed, the charges and
matters set forth therein had been
laid before the Mayor and are still
pending before him. It was therefore
asked that the proceedings be arrested
until the determination by the Mayor
of the proceedings before him.
It was late in the afternoon before
the papers were filed, and, as the
Judge had other cases requiring his
attention, it was decided that the argu
ments on the demurrer and motions
should be postponed till to-morrow
afternoon at 4 o'clock. The defend
ants were excused from further at
tendance till the demurrer and motions
weue disposed of.

FIXES RATING
OF THE DAIRIES
Health Officer Ragan Says
3lany Ranches in Outside
Counties Are Not Sanitary
FIGHTS FOE PURER GAS
Will Urge Supervisors to
Pass Ordinance Limiting
Use of Carbon Monoxide
Health Officer Ragan yesterdny
completed the official rating of nine
ty-nine dairies in Alameda, Santa
Clara, San Mateo, Contra Costa and
Marin counties Inspected during the
present month by Dairy Inspectors
Brady and Landrum, who filed their
reports thereon a few days ago. Of
the dairies inspected thirty-nine are
rated as good, twenty-two as fair and
thirty-eignt as poor. The names of
the dairies, together with their stand
ing as to sanitary conditions, water
supply and condition of cows, will be
posted In the health office so that the
public may be informed as to the ex
act status of dairies in outside coun
ties. Although the local health of
ficials have no Immediate control over
the dairies in other counties, they
have the power to prevent the milk
shipped from unsanitary dairies from
being distributed among families by
local milk depots. This course will
be pursued in order to compel the
placing of all such dairies in such
condition as to comply in every re
spect with the existing ordinance.
Ragan will shortly appear before
the Board of Supervisors to urge the
passage of his proposed ordinance
prohibiting the presence of more than
22 per cent of carbon monoxide in il
luminating gas. On account of the in
vestigation now on for the purpose of
fixing rates to be charged for gas Ra
gan thinks this an opportune time to
show the Supervisors that the gas
served to consumers contains too
much of the deadly^ carbon monoxide
and that deaths from asphyxiation
are too common on that account.
"Private analyses," Ragan says,
show the presence of ag high as 4 5
and 50 per cent of the monoxide." The
object of his ordinance is to minimize
the danger from asphyxiation by pro
hibiting the presence of too high a
percentage of the poisonous com
pound in the illuminant known a3
water gas, which is being supplied
almost entirely by the lighting com
panies.

LONDON. Feb. 18.â The British
Postmaster General has come to an
agreement with the National Tele
phone Company to take over its busi
ness and buy its plant. Lord Stanley
is congratulated by the London press
upon the submission. to Parliament of
what is considered; to be a very good
md fair bargain. The - price .- to be
paid is to be settled by arbitration.
All that is to be paid is the fair market
value of the plant and works of the
company.
The purchase is to be on what is
called "tram-way ; terms"; that is to
say. no payment is to be made in re
rj>ect of compulsory . purchase, good
â will or past or future profits. Three
fourths of the whole purchase money
may. at the option of the Government,
be paid by way of annuity for a term
rot exceeding twenty year*.' '
It is impossible to estimate with a
Kxeat degree of accuracy the price
which the Government will, have to
pay for the "telephone monopoly.
When. !n April, 1896, the postoftVe
took over the trunk lines, the cost
vas 52.295.570. but the purchase of
the whole busfness, of course, is a
much more serious ; matter, from the
fact hat the company has : a spare
capital of nearly J22.550.000. with de
bentures amounting to nearly $20.

CHICAGO, Feb. 18.â "I hayÂ« received
my death sentence. It is my firm con
viction that I will not survive this op
eration, for I know I am afflicted with
cancer."
This, in effect, is what Dr. William
R. Harper, president of the University
of Chicago, said in the presence of
some of his friends in discussing the
operation set for next Wednesday.
He does not expect ever to take up the
active presidency again. Friends and
relatives of the educator have been
notified to this effect.
John D. Rockefeller, founder of the
university, is expected to arrive in Chi
cago soon and Professor Robert F.
Harper, brother of the president, is cx
i to reach New York to-morow
night or on Monday, from Europe.
Gloom overspreads the university, for
nearly every one realizes the serious
ness of Dr. Harper's illness.
Dean Harry Pratt Judson will be
acting president as soon as Dr. Har
per relinquishes work.
Three separate and thorough examin

time Dr. Harper was operated upon
for appendicitis have been made by
physicians and surgeons studying his
case, and the unanimous decision, it is
said, is that he has cancer.

Russian Assassins, Gloruing in Their Success, Boast
of Murders Yet to Be Committed.
ST. PETERSBURG. Feb. 19.â The
assassination of Grand Duke Sergius
in Moscow has been followed by an
opidemic of crimes of a similar nature.
A district official named Gnoutouf has
been assassinated by Armenians at
Igdyr, in the trans-Caucasus. The mo
tive for the crime was political. The
mayor of Vagarshapad, also in the
trans-Caucasus, was shot and killed
near his residence, the murderer es
caping. In Kishenev, the scene of so
much bloodshed in the past, the Prefect
of Police was attacked on the street
by a man armed with a club and
severely injured before his rescue was
affected.
All Russia dreads what the morrow
may bring forth. It is not believed
that the terrorists will stop with the
murder of Sergius. The carrying out
of sentences of death will continue,
with Governor General Trepoff, Min
ister of the Interior Bouligan or
another of the Grand Dukes as the
next victim. Indeed, the assassins,
glorying in the success of their latest
murderous plot, may strike at the
throne itself. Never before have
nihilists and revolutionists been so
bold in their boasting. Throughout the
empire pamphlets have been distrib
uted detailing the circumstances at
tending the death of Sergius, and giv
ing notification that the work of hor
ror has but begun. The Dowager
Empress, mother of the Czar, has re
ceived a letter warning her that she
will be the next victim.
GEAR'S ACT OF CLEMENCY.
An official announcement made last
night says:
"Grand Duke Paul Alexandrovitch
will resume his military service as gen
eral aide-de-camp to the Emperor and
will attend the funeral of Grand Duke
Sergius at Moscow."
The decision of the Emperor in this
period of his grief to restore Grand
Duke Paul, who is the youngest brother
of Grand Duke Sergius, to rank and
family is felt to be a most gracious act.
Grand Duke Paul was degraded sev
eral years ago because he persisted in
contracting a morganatic marriage
with Madame Olga Pistolkoos, despite
the commands of the Emperor and the
wishes of the Imperial family. He was
deprived of rank is the army and his
orders and . decorations' "were with
drawn. The doors of Russia were
closed to him and Grand Duke and
Grand Duchess Sergius extended the
shelter of their home to his two chil
dren by his first marriage and virtually

adopted them. Of late the decree !
against Grand Duke Paul has been re
laxed to the extent that he was allowed j
to return to Russia, and the Emperor's i
act now permits him to take his right- j
ful nlace with the other imperial
mourners.
PRESS APPEALS TO THROXE.
The Russ and the Novosti, comment
ing on the assassination of Grand Duke
Sergius, point ont how impossible is a
continuation of present conditions. The
Russ says:
"From the day of the death of
Minister of the Interior *Yon Plehwe
the fighting organization of the Social
revolutionists held its peace and the
four months of Prince Sviatopolk-Mir
sky's regime was a period of active J
but peaceful propaganda. Now I
blood again has been shed, and al- I
though foreigners predict all will end
in revolution, the case is not hopeless. |
Only let representatives of the people
be allowed to participate in the Gov
ernment and the nation is directed to
the road of peace and our sufferings
must end. We do not want blood and
terror, but peace and peaceful condi
-tions. In this hope we see our only
safety from the tragic incidents that
are occurring about us."
The Novosti says:
"The victims of the war number tens
of thousands. A hundred high of
ficials are among these victims. Peo
ple are losing their lives in the streets
of Russian cities. We cannot live
longer under such conditions. The
happiness of the people should not be
bought with blood. Compromises of
the bureaucracy cannot save the situa
tion. Enough of this blood and terror.
The Emperor must honestly and sin
cerely meet the* hopes of the people half
way. The throne must join hands with
the people against the bureaucracy.
This is the only salvation from the
horrors that threaten to darken the
near future."
STATE REQUIEM MASS.
A solemn state requiem, mass for
the repose of the soul of Grand Duke
Sergius was celebrated at St. Paul's
here this afternoon, at which the
metropolitan of St. Petersburg offici
ated and the representatives of the
foreign powers, the Ministers and
other dignitaries were present in full ,
uniform, but not a single member of
the imperial family attended.
Several orders and decorations with
which Grand Duke Sergius' breast
was decorated at the time of his as
sassination fell at the fe?t of a sentry
in tta* arsenal 1100 yards away. His
sword was shattered, but the jeweled
rings he wore were recovered from
the spectators of the outrage, who had
picked them up. A gold cross which
the Grand Duke, like all of the ortho
dox, wore suspended from a chain
around his neck Was not recovered.
Grand Duchess Elizabeth has issued a
piteous appeal to the public to search
for and return this relic.
ASSASSIN AN ARISTOCRAT.
Clothed in Peasant Garb, but Belongs
to a Higher Class.
MOSCOW, Feb. 18. â A memorial
service to-day at the Alexieff Church
of the Tsu Monastery was attended by
Grand Duchess Elizabeth and Grand
Dukes Constantine and Dimitrl, all
the high civil and military officers,
representatives of the municipality
and Zemstvos and of different classes
of society and the foreign Consuls.
Grand Duke Sergius lies in an
oak coffin-. It stands on a silver bier
among a mass of growing palms.
There are two wreaths on the casket,
one from Grand Duchess Elizabeth
and the other from the late Grand
Duke's suite.
The coffin is half covered by a
grand ducal pall of gold embroidery,
with borders of ermine, and the Grand
Duke's decorations are arranged on
either side of the casket, in order of
precedence.
Prayers are to be said thrice daily
by the clergy and there will be day
and night watches for the dead by
generals and officials of the First.
| Second, Third and Fourth ranks and
a number of personal friends, while
two officers of the Moscow garrison
will stand as sentinels at the head and
foot of the bier.
An extraordinary session of the
Municipal Council has passed resolu
tions requesting the Minister of the
Interior to present the condolences of
i the city to the Emperor and also sent
a message of sympathy to Grand
Duchess Elizabeth.
It appears to be confirmed that the
Grand Duke, when killed, was on his
way to the Governor General's pal
ace on Tverskaia, where he resided
while Governor General, for the pur
pose of taking a bath. The Grand
Duke was a great lover of Russian
baths, those he had arranged in the
palace being most sumptuous. Vice

SACRAMENTO. Feb. 18. â Standing
c t the bar of the Superior Court, Sen
ators Bunkers, Wright, Einmons and
French listened this morning to the
reading: of the Indictments charging
them with the crime of bribery. They
t ; l>oke only to affirm tile fact that their
true names were written in the in
struments of accusation. They did not
I>lead; did not admit their guilt nor
**>*crt their innocence, but bat down
and with anxicus eyes watched their
counsel battle for their freedom on
loohnicaiities of the lav. .
The accused were ui> for arraign
ment before Superior Judge E. C.
Hart. When the cases were called all ;
ihe accused were present in coiurt ex
cept Bunkerp. He entered after his
name had been called and walked
down the. aisle to a seat beside his
counsel, oblivious to the fact that his
head was covered with his derby un
til the fact was called to his atten- ;
ticn. Then he uncovered in the pres- â¢
er.ee of the court and took his station j
brside the prisoners' dock, while Dis
trict Attorney Seymour read the in
dictment upon which he hopes to send
him to the penitentiary.
The opening of court found a full
anaj- of counsel in attendance. Em
jnens. Bunkers and Wright were rep
resented by ex-Senator H. V. More
house of San Jose, counsel in chief,
end Attorneys Copeland, Jacobs,
James and Alexander. George D. Col
jins of San Francisco announced that ,
he was present in the interest of Sena
tor Frank French. District Attorney
."-â¢>r:i was reinforced by his assist
ant, J. K. Hughes.
The cases of sevoral other prisoners
uj- for arraignment were disposed of
and then the arguments on the de
murrers began.
QUESTIONS AUTHORITY.
The main points made by ex-Sena
tor ' -rehouse are that nothing in the
indictment shows the committee of
which the four accused Senators were
members had any authority from the
Senate to conduct investigations of the
corporations named in the proceed
ings; that even if they had there was
:ioihing before them at the time they
are alleged to have taken the money
tMid finally that neither the Senate nor
iht Legislature as a whole has any
power to investigate the affairs of pri
vate corporations or individuals or
delegate to any committee any such
authority.
In answer to a question by Judge
Hart, who followed the argument with
' all the keenness that has given him
;t Statewide fame as a criminal lawyer,
storehouse said he did not make the
Â« ontention that a matter regularly be
fore a committee of the Legislature
was not before the Legislature. He
admitted that it was. His contention,
he said, was that no such matter as
that which the Committee of Commis
sions had undertaken to investigate
could legally be investigated by it,
even had it been regularly referred to
it. which, he said, had not been done
in the present instance.

to stand for arraignment. After the
indictment had been read Attorney
CollinF. addressing the court, said:
"It it please the court. I am here
as the representative of Senator
French. We ask for time. It is prob
able that we will ask that this indict
ment be iÂ«et aside, this depending upon
investigations now under way. We
would like to have the matter go over
till next Saturday."
District Attorney Seymour objected,
saying that though he did not wish
any action taken that would prevent
the defendants taking advantage of
all thtir rights, he was anxious that
all the capes be brought to issue
the same time.
'ThÂ« j matter of time,' said Judge
Hart, "is one counsel have the right
to determine. Will you have time to
prepare your plans. Mr. Collins, by
Thursday, the 23d inst. ?"
Collins said he was agreeable to that
date and the case against French was
( â¢â¢â ntinued until that time, to be called
at 10 a. m.
Emmons was then called to the bar.
After the indictment had been reaJ,
Judge Hart said:
"Does the indictment contain your
true name?"
"My true name ie E. J. Emmons,"
answered the accused Senator in a low
voice. Emmons apparently greatly
suffered the humiliation of his posi
tion.
PRESENTS HIS POINTS.
A number of criminals that sat rat
tling their chains in the prisoner's dock
were next arraigned. The docket
cleared. ilorehouÃe was called upon to
present hie argument in support of the
demurrers he*had interposed on behalf
of Emmons, Wright and Bunkers. In
part he said:
"We are not proceeding here upon
the common law definition of bribery,
but upon the statutory definition,
which makes the bribery of a legis
lator possible only in the matter of a
question actually pending before the
Legislature. Where the constitution
has defined a public offense the Legis
lature cannot make a statute that will
exceed or detract from the effect of
the constitutional provision. The
character of the offense surrounding
one Grange who is interested in this
case is clearly defined, but rot so in
the statute under which the prosecu
tion is proceeding here against the ae
'â¢u*fÂ»d Senators.
The constitution cle.irly sets forth
what shall constitute bribery upon the
part of a Senator. It strictly says that
to be a subject of bribery a question
BNWt be one pending before the Legis
lature, not before the Senate or the
Assembly or any committee thereof,
but a matter pending before the Legis
lature ac a whole upon which it is
competent tc act. This indictment seta
forth nothing to show that the accused
here accepted a bribe to influence their
official action or vote upon any matter !
Pending before the Legislature and no j
other question could be the subject of '
bribery."
"If a matter is before the Legisla
| ture r.f which it is at least competent
:to take Jurisdiction," asked Judge
Hart, "and this matter is referred to a
i properly constituted committee and an j
effort is made to influence this com
mittee beffere it has returned its report, !
ie it your contention that such would
i not be a matter pending before the j
! legislature?"
"No. it !s not," answered Morehouse.
"Undoubtedly in a case where a legia
â  lative accepted a reward as a member
j of a committee to influence his action
j in the matter of a question that had
j been regularly and properly submitted
j by either house to the committee of
â  which the accused was a member he
j would be guilty of bribery."
CITES DECISIONS.
Referring to the allegation in the
1 indictment that the Senators had been
\ bribed to vote In a "particular man
i ncr," Morehouse asked, "What does
i this 'particular manner' mean? How
can there be a particular side of the
i question when there is no question?
1 The entire Legislature had no power.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY. FEBRUARY 19, 1905.
either by special committee or com
mittee of the whole or in joint session,
to investigate the affairs of a private
corporation or a private individual. |
There was no power on the part of the
Legislature to appoint a special com
mittee to make such an investigation.
That power belongs to the judicial
power alone. The Legislature may, it
is true, appoint committees to inves
tigate asylum? and other public insti
; tutions, but it can go no further. The
I constitution prevents the Investigation
i of any private corporation or indlvid-
S ual except through an action filed be
t fore a judicial tribunal by Some other
I private corporation or individual."
Counsel cited decisions of the Su
! preme Court on this important point,
which, if sustained, will probably open
the road to freedom for the Senators
accused.
Counsel also cited the case of Ice
land Stanford, who refused to an
swer, certain questions put by the Pa
cific Railway Commission appointed
by Congress in 1887 regarding a
voucher for $781,000 expended for
some purpose Senator Stanford could
not remember. Justice Field and
Judge Sawyer held that Congress
could not give any commission au
thority to demand the books of a pri
vate corporation and that the courts
alone were open to adjudicate all such
matters.
The crime of bribery, counsel said,
could not be predicated on a promise
to do Fomething that the party had no
warrant under the law to Â£o.
Judge Hart then ordered a recess
Until 1:20 o'clock.
CONTINUANCE GKANTED.
In the afternoon Morehonse spoke
until nearly 3 o'clock, citing more
cases, among them those of Judges
who had accepted money before cases
! had come up to influence their dcci
! slons and had been acquitted on the
I ground that there was nothing before
i the court at the time of the alleged
i bribery.
District Attorney Seymour seemed
disinclined to go on with his argument
lat that time. "Does your Honor wish
! to hear any more of this case at the
1 present time?" he asked.
"I am willing to hear more and have
the arguments finished as soon as pos
sible," said Judge Hart.
"It will shorten my argument if I
have time to consider the points made
by the defense," said the District At
torney.
"If any new plan is sprung by the
I District Attorneyâ any unexpected pro
cedure â we want time to â¢ combat it,"
said Morehouse.
Judge Hart continued the case to
Monday morning at 10 o'clock. Those
i present listened eagerly to his final re
marks, hoping to catch some intima
tion of how he had been impressed by
the points advanced, and the accused
| Senators took much hope from them,
i his closing words, addressed to District
j Attorney Seymour, were:
"The principal question which 1 de
sire to be enlightened upon is the
power of the Legislature to investigate
concerns of the kind which were inves
tigated by this committee. I simply
i throw that out, Mr. District Attorney,
I and ask you to take that branch of the
! subject up."
Martin Kelly was not in evidence to
â  day and it is said that he left for San
! Francisco immediately after being re
leased by the Senate investigating
committee. District Attorney Seymour
| said he had been too busy preparing
his argument in support of the indict
ments against the boodlers to take up
Kelly's case, but that he would read
over the testimony bearing on Kelly's
relation to the boodlers early next
week and Vould then determine just
what action he would take to prosecute
the wily ex-boss of San. Francisco.
SOUNDS NOTE OF WARNING.
Changes in Bill of National Body to
Hold "Get-RJoh-Quick" Schemes.
A matter of great importance to all
members of fraternal beneficiary asso
ciations that work on the lodge system
is a bill that has been introduced in the
Legislature of this and other States
purporting to be one prepared by the
National Fraternal Congress at its ses
sion last September in St. Louis, and
which has for its purpose the regulat
ing of fraternal beneficiary associations
so that all shall be on an equal plane,
also to prevent "get-rich-quick" asso
ciations from taking advantage of the
lodge system for the purpose of delud
ing those who might desire protection.
Edwin O. Wood, past president of the
National Fraternal Congress and a
member of the executive committee of
that body, has sent out a letter of
warning, in which he says:
"I deem it a duty to refer to this pur
ported bill of the National Fraternal
Congress without a moment's delay in
the fear that it may be introduced in
some Legislature before the members
of the congress fully understand the
extraordinary provisions which have
been added to section 14.
"There is a very serious error or mis
understanding somewhere, for the last
three lines ot" section 14. as they appear
in the bill just sent out, were never
adopted, agreed to, or even considered
at any session of the National Frater
nal Congress or of the law section.
"I am informed by the president of
the law section that section 14, as
adopted at St. Louis, was the same in
every particular as the section adopted
at Milwaukee in 1903. Yet there seems
to have been added the following, 'and
such associations shall be exempt from
the provisions of sections 1, 2, 3, 5 and 9
of this act. 1
"Any bill purporting to be the sense
or wish of the National Fraternal Con
gress which exempts societies already
organized or which may reincorporate,
from section 1, which contains a defi
nition of a fraternal beneficiary soci
ety; section 2, defining the lodge sys
tem; section S. referring to representa
tive form of government; section 5, to
benefits, and section 9, to funds, would
be a bill exempting them from the vi
tal, fundamental and principal feature
of the entire fraternal beneficiary sys
tem.
"A bill with these additions to sec

good faith and integrity of every one
connected with the fraternal system of

â¢'I have no information as to how or

them, nor would any one but the con
gress have any semblance of authority
to make such radical changes.
"The exemptions In section 14 in the
bill just sent out would permit
any and all kinds of "get-rich
quick" schemes to work in the
same of and under the protection
of fraternity. If we are to have a new
law placed upon the statute books in
nearly forty States this winter we
should go slow about opening the doors
to money-making concerns, for cer
tainly far better no legislation at all
than to have bad and dangerous laws
enacted."

SAUSALITO'S POLL TAX
LAW UNCONSTITUTIONAL-
Decision of Judge Lennon Saves Each
Resident of Bay Town a Dollar
a Year.
SAN RAFAEL, Feb. 18. â Judge
Lennon decided to-day that the Sau
salito street poll tax ordinance is un
constitutional and released Frederick
Marriott on habeas corpus. The or
dinance was passed some time ago by
the Town Trustees of Sausalito and
provided .that every male citizen of
the town should pay a street poll tax
of $1.
Frederick Marriott, a San Francisco
journalist, refused to pay the tax and
was arrested. He applied to the Su
perior Court for a writ of habeas cor
pus, which was granted.

BAKERSFIELD, Feb. 18. â In the
suit of J. F. Walker against J. A.
Chanslor et al. a special session of
the Superior Court was held last night
to hear the testimony of a physician.
The suit is to recover $50,000 damages
for injuries received in a shooting af
fray which occurred in April, 1901,
â when a party of men, including the
defendants and others in sympathy
with the Mount Diablo Oil Company,
attempted to drive the plaintiff and
G. P. Cornell off a claim which it
was claimed the Superior Sunset Oil
Company had jumped.
Champion Stone-Thrower.
"The Bluejacket (Indian Territory)

champion stone-thrower. It says:
"Frank Slagle, a man hitherto as
unknown to fame as waa Alton B.
Parker before the election, is the new
star in the -horizon. A man who dem
onstrated his ability to ' take one
smooth stone, and from a distance of
200 feet land a blow on the cranium
of a bald eagle which caused that
lordly bird to retire from public lifr
as completely as does the successful
candidate for Vice President of the
United States." To the incredulous
this should carry conviction: "Size
of bird, seven feet two inches from

Edward Hess Alleges Provocation
for Brandishing of Knife.
Wife Is Matrimonial Agent
JAMES C. CRAWFORD
Thwarted In willful endeavor to
8;&*h bis better half with a butcher's
knife, Edward Hess repeatedly plunged
the weapon into a door which she
cloeed behind her as she fled, and then
he was arrested and accused of at
tacking her with intent to kilL Police
JudÂ«Â« Cor.lan remanded him for trial
In the Superior Court, with ball fixed
-n the sum of J2OOO.
It was the green-eyed monster that
Umpired Mr. Hess* berserk perform
ance. Hl* wife, who eclipses him In
sreture and weight, managed a matri
monial bureau at 1167 Howard street,
and he suspected that she harbored
undue affection for one Mr. Trebeau,
v-ho combined the vocations of barber
end real estate speculator. She con
fessed a liking for Mr. Trebeau's so
ciety, because he was a gentleman of
rare Intellectual attainments and ex
ceptional brilliance as a conversa
tionist, and she warmly combited
the insinuation that her esteem for
him led to unwifely conduct. Her
business of matchmaker, she averred,
necessitated freedom of behavior with
the opposite sex, which might be
ceemed improper if Indulged In by a
feminine claimant to respectability en
paged in any other profession, but she
dared her spouse or any one else to
prove that -her relationship with Mr.
i rebeau or any other masculine adult
had ever exceeded the platonic Mr.
Kess was in Quest of such proof when
he saw enough, he informed the court,
to verify his suspicion and justify his
knife play. . .. -
Returning to his home when his ar
rival there was unexpected by the in
atM, he found his wife, his minor
Fon, Willie, and Mr. Trebeau assem
bled at dinner. If the lady had been
occupying her wonted place at the
head of the table, Mr. Hess avers, he
v.ould have retired as silently as he
had entered and the party would have
b*en unaware of his visit. But when
he saw that Mrs. Hess was utilizing
Mr. Trebeau's lap for a seat he felt
that the very worst of his imaginings
could not be unjust to her. As the
physical proportions of Mr. Trebeau
Tv<:re considerably less than those of
fcis buxom burden, not much of him
v.-as visible to the enraged Mr. Hess,
vho afterward opined that his inva
sion must have afforded as much re-
Hef as fright to the human chair. Mr.
Hess' first whoop of indignation Im
pelled Mrs. Hess to release Mr. Tre
beau. who precipitately fled through
a rear door and over the back yard
fence, â¢while little Willie also ran from
the anartment and to the street. As
the husband grabbed the carving
knife from the table the wife fled to
the hallway, prudently closing the
dcor behind her and clinging to the
krob, while her infuriated pursuer
j&bbed his weapon into her shield and
howled In impotent rage.
Mrs. Hess denies that she at any
time nestled in Mr. Trebeau's lap. and
Mr. Trebeau corroborates the denial.

g-ases and impurities always present in
the stomach and intestines and carries
them out of the system.
Charcoal sweetens the breath after
-..ng, drinking: or after eating
onions and other odorous vegetables.
Charcoal effectually clears and im-
proves the complexion. It whitens the
teeth and further acts as a natural
end eminently safe cathartic
It absorbs the injurious gases which
collect in the stomach and bowels; It
disinfects the mouth and throat from
the poison of catarrh.
All druggists sell charcoal In onÂ©
form or another, but probably the best
charcoal and the most for the money
is in Stuart's Charcoal Lozenges; they
are composed of the finest powdered
Willow charcoal and other harmless
antiseptics In tablet form, or rather In
the form of large." pleasant tasting
lozenges, the charcoal being mixed
with honey.
The daily use of these lozenges will
suon tell in a much improved cordl-
ticn of the general health, better com-
plexion, sweeter breath and v purer
bjcod. and the beauty of It is that no
possible harm can result from . their
continued use, but, on the- contrary,
great benefit.
A Buffalo physician. In speaking, of
the benefits of charcoal, says: "I ad-
vise Stuart's Charcoal Lozenges to all i
patients suffering from gas in stomach j
and bowels, and to clear the complex-
ion and purify, the breath, mouth and
throat; I also believe the liver 13 great-
ly benefited by the daily use of them;
they cost but twenty-five cents a box at
drug stores, and, although vln some \
cense a patent preparation, yet I be-
lieve I get more and better charcoal in
Etuart's * Charcoal Lozenges than In
â¢ry of the ordinary charcoal tablets." <

E. Bart el denied that the sack of
potatoes which he attempted to steal
from Mrs. Mary Casedebat of 640 Clay
street weighed 220 pounds, as alleged
by its owner.
"I was well loaded with liquor when
I picked up the sack," he said to Judge
Conlan, "and even when sober I
couldn't lift 220 pounds." He was pro
nounced guilty of petty 4arceny and re
manded for sentence.
William Daly, Roland Murdock and
Frank G. Hancock, well dressed young
fellows, were charged with having as
saulted Garfield Rayl, and Judge Ca
baniss fined them $10 apiece.
Mr. Rayl testified that he was din
ing with a lady in an Italian restaur
ant on Davis street when the defend
ants, who were seated at a nearby
table, not only uttered remarks uncom
plimentary to his fair companion and
himself, but also made eyes at her,
Mr. Daly being especially active in the
latter offense. Subsequently the trio
renewed its provoking conduct on the
street and proceeded to thrash the
male complainant when he showed re
sentment.
Benjamin Alexander, discharged
without honor from the Eighteenth
United States Infantry, was arrested
at the Presidio for carrying a conceal
ed weapon, and in the court of Judge
Mogan he unconsciously demonstrated
the fearful effect of "vino," a popular
tipple in the J'hiltppines, on the men
tality of the A.nglo-Saxon consumer.
When the Eighteenth returned from
the islands and went into cantonment
Alexander was dismissed from the ser
vice, but continued to loiter among
his former comrades until last Thurs
day, v.hen the officer of the day report
ed to Ccptain Arrasmlth that the man
was armed with a revolver and had
announced his intention to kill Cap-
tain Evans and' Lieutenant Cummlngs
and annihilate the entire regiment if
preventive attempt were made. He
â¢M arrested and disarmed and Cap
tain Arrasmith appeared to prosecute.
""Why did you. act in that way?" the
Jud-_'Â»i asked the defendant.
"Because," was the earnestly utter
ed reply. "Evans and Cummings de
served *to be killed for the way they
treated me. The sparkling globes. 12x

night were operated by them. They
worked the '.vires and T never knew

Th*> Judg-e looked inquiringly at the
captain, who narrowly noted the de
fendant's manner, and then said that
it was the resultant of overindulgence
in "vino." â¢
"It's terrible staff.** said the officer.
"To the white man who drinks it
immoderately it means either death or
insanity."
"I have heard of It before." the Judge

The man's mind seemed to be per

other than that of his fancied griev
ance against Captain Evans and Lieu

tion should remain so loner after his

TREMBLING
IK FEAR OF
ASSASSINS
Czar and His House

Continued From Page 25, Column 5.
v|
ing the Grand Duke from the Nicho
las Palace, noticed a crowd in Red
square and turned back to warn the ,
Grand Duke to proceed through a side I
street, but it was already too late. The
explosion occurred as he reached the j
Kremlin gate.
While the assassin was dressed as a
peasant, it is evident that he belongs
to a higher class. His papers were all
forged and there is no clue to his j
identity.
Policeman Lonitieff, who was near '<
the Nikolsky gate and who seized the I
assassin, says that as soon as the I
Grand Duke's carriage drove into the
Senate square the murderer moved
out and with unerring aim hurled the
bomb directly into the carriage win- !
dow. /a blinding flash and a terrific
explosion followed, the force of which
reduced the vehicle to splinters. The ;
air was filled with a red haze, blood
being spattered to a distance of 300
feet. The maddened, wounded horses
dashed forward, dragging the coach- i
man, Andrew, a man of gigantic stat- !
ure,,but they soon fell in their tracks.
An officer who witnessed the trag
edy from the barracks directed some
soldiers to bring a stretcher. The of- .
fleer covered the remains, of which
only a leg and a portion of the body
were instact, with the overcoat of one
of the men.
PE\ PICTURE OP SERGIUS.
Grand Duke Regarded All Russian i
Liberals as Bomb Throwers.
PARIS, Feb. 18. â The assassination j
of Grand Duke Sergius absorbs public :
and official attention, as personally the i
Grand Duke was well known here, ow- ;
ing to his frequent visits to Paris, |
while politically he was regarded in
Government circles as the real power
behind the throne. Accordingly, the !
authorities are associating themselves
with Russia's official period of mourn
ing.
Foreign Minister Delcasse's gala re
ception, which was to take place to
night, has been postponed.
Grand Duke Sergius visited Paris !
each year with Grand Duchess Eliza- j
oeth. They appeared quite democratic, j
stopping at the Hotel de Liverpool, j
promenading the boulevards, driving j
in the Bois de Boulogne and visiting â ,
shopping and art centers. The Grand
Duke attracted marked attention be- i
cause of his massive appearance. He !
was the largest of Alexander ll's big :
sons, and was more than six feet tall, j
a heavy blonde beard surrounding a
ruddy and rather benevolent face with
strong features. The Grand Duke and j
Grand Duchess observed strict in- I
cognito, so as to permit of larger liber- j
ty of action.
Semi-official letters Just received
from St. Petersburg give prophetic
sidelights upon the events leading up
to the assassination. Grand Duke
Sergius, it is pointed out, was an un
compromising opponent of any reform,
which, h? declared, was organized war
fare against autocracy handed down
to the Emperors. He exercised strong
influence in this direction upon his
brother, Alexander 111. One day Alex
ander, exasperated by the popular un
rest, declared the agitators ought to
be sent to the forests of the Caucasus
to feed upon acorns. Sergius replied:
"That would be more digestive and
less dangerous than letting them nurse
Idle dreams of bomb throwing, for ev
ery pretended Liberal is at heart a
bomb thrower."
Sergius exercised the same influence !
over Nicholas II against the realiza- I
tion of reforms. He frequently spoke
of the assassination of his (Sergius') i
father, Alexander 11, representing to '
Nicholas that the crime was a chas- ;
tisement of heaven for relaxing the
autocratic power to the Liberal de- !
mands. When the recent Liberal move- I
ment developed Sergius exclaimed:
"Better far that we perish by bombs I
than by reforms. There is some bray- j
cry in the first; there is only cowardice j
in the last."
It was the result of this persistent
attitude of Grand Duke Sergius against
reform that largely inspired the late
Minister of the Interior yon Plehwe's
iron determination. More recently it
was the Grand Duke who sent Gen
eral Trepoff to subdue the rising at
St. Petersburg with an iron hand. The
the theater, these two ladies were
standing at the bar with a gentleman.-
I had heard that one of the ladies said
something unkind about me, and I de
cided to ask her about it, so in a lady
like way I said to this tall lady (Miss
Dimples), 'Why the deuce did you say
my husband is not my husband?' and
then she flared up and the other lady
butted in and took her part, and the
manager locked both the ladles in his
office until I could get away. But as
soon as they .were released the two la
dies followed me and attacked on
the street and a gentleman friend of
the tall lady helped them."
Patrolman Nelson explained that the
gentleman friend alluded to was one
Larry Quigley, proprietor of a Pacific
street saloon, and the further continu
ance of the celebrated case was or
dered until Mr. Quigley could be haled
into court to Bhow cause.

check to former Minister of the In
terior Sviatopolk-Mirsky's Liberal
plans and the subsequent retirement of
Sviatopolk-Mirsky are attributed to
Sergius.
The foregoing extracts from semi-of
ficial letters (mailed before the assas
sination) conclude:
"However, one ought not to think
Grand Duke Sergius hard or cruel at
heart. He is thoroughly good and
benevolent. He fully hopes that the
suppression of reforms will save Rus
sia from convulsions and assure the
people a happy outcome. The best
proof that Sergius is not a bloody man
Is his horror of warfare. He opposed
the Japanese war until hostilities be
gan, and if peace had been realized it
would certainly have been owing to
Sergius' powerful influence."
Grand Duchess Elizabeth is greatly
liked here, owing to her amiability,
which was generally considered to be
in marked contrast with Grand Duke
Sergius' disposition. An American na
val officer who visited Moscow a few
months ago went to the Kremlin,
where contributions were being receiv
ed for the Red Cross. The Grand
Duchess personally received the con
tributions and graciously gave receipts
in her own handwriting.
Train Charged by Rhinoceros.
A collision occurred on the Ugan
da Railway, British East Africa, that
would be possible nowhere else on
earth. A huge bull rhinoceros rushed
out of the bush and charged at full
speed the so-called "up mixed" train,
which was slowing down as it ap
proached the station Sultan Hamond,
218 miles from Mombasa. The train
was stopped and the "rhino" was dis
covered about 100 yards down the
track. Slowly he returned to the jun
gle and was lost to sight. He did not
escape unharmed, for pieces of his
thick skin were found adhering to the
train, but the fierceness of his assault
smashed the engine step and- splin
tered the inch and a half footboard
of the first carirage.

lady gave me a sov'rin instead of a
shillin* and I called: 'Beg your pardon,
madam, I've got a sov'rin instead of a

FOR GIRL'S LOVE
Komance in Life of Young
Italian Is Kevealed and
a Pardon Is the Kesult
Special Dispatch to The Call.
TACOMA, Feb. 18. â Governor Mead
to-day granted a full pardon to Car
mine Pettinato, a young Italian, sen
tenced to prison in December, 1902,
for three years. According to the pe
titioner for the pardon the youth Ital
ian was in love with a Spokane girl.
The girl's parents objected to her
suitor, so the young people ran away.
They returned upon the father's
promise to forgive them, whereupon
the irate parent had young Pettinato
arrested on a charge of assault. The
latter, to save the fair name of his
sweetheart, made no defense and was
convicted.
The facts were presented to Gov
ernor McÃrifle a year ago and he pa
roled Pettinato. At that time a peti
tion for his release was signed by the
Prosecuting Attorney, the Sheriff and
other officials. The petition presented
to Governor Mead shows that after
gaining his freedom the Italian mar
ried the girl with her parents* con
sent and is a worthy young fellow.
Eighty thousand acres of land will

"MIGNON" WITH
STRONG SUPPORT
AT THE TIVOLI
'/A MME. FRANCISCA, WHO WILL
- SING IN "MIGNON" AT THE |
'â 'â < TIVOLI WEDNESDAY. i
The management of the Tivoli has
determined to make the last week of
the grand opera season at the Tivoli a
memorable one. Tetrazzini will sing
on Tuesday night ln "The Pearl Fish
ers" and on Thursday night ln "I Puri
tani." On Wednesday night Thomas'
delightful opera, "Mignon," will be
heard in this city for the first time in
several years. '
The popularity of this beautiful
composition is great and the reason it
in so rarely heard is that it requires
two great primma donnas and it is
seldom that both can be spared for
the same peroframnce, as in most'
grand opera companies it is a necessity
that they should appear on alternate
nights.
The Tivoli management is fortunate
that the famous singer, Madame Fran
cisca, is enjoying a vacation in this
city and it has sue oeeded in securing
her for the role of Felina. Signorina
Berlindi will sin? Mignon and the re
maining roles will he strongly cast.
For jioxt Sunday night, February ?6,
ftn eKcepflonftllt- 'attractive programme
will be presented and will close one of
the most brillinntly succesful grand
opera seasons this city has ever
known.
Director Polacco's symphony con
cert, which was Announced for this
afternoon at the Tivoli, has unavoid
ably bern postponed one wreck.w r eek. Sig
nor Polacco was compelled late last
evening to cancel the engagement,
owing to thp failure of the orchestra
tions to arrivo in time. The concert,
he promises, will be given at the Tiv
oli next Sunday afternoon.

HAS NEW PLAN
FOR TREATIES
President Hopes to Secure
Through The Hague What
He Could Not From Senate
WOEKING OUT SCHEME
Intends to Submit Proposals
for Arbitration Pacts
Between the Big Powers
WASHINGTON, Feb. 18.â President
Roosevelt has not abandoned his idea
of obtaining with the leading powers
of the world definite, comprehensive
and effective agreements on a scheme
of International arbitration. It will be
his effort to have the matter so pre
sented to the attention of the second
Hague conference, which is to be held
at the conclusion of the Russo-Jap
anese war, as to insure favorable ac
tion of a character that will be bind
ing upon all the powers signatory to
the proposed new convention.
Instructions will be given to repre
sentatives of the United States at the
conference to press for such an agree
ment. The details of the instructions
have not been worked out yet, of
course, as the time of holding the con
ference has not been determined. It
is understood that this country will
specify with some definiteness the sub
jects which under the proposed agree
ment may be submitted to a rbi tr)a,tion.
Such an agreement, according to this
view, would be more effective than the
general treaties entered into between
the United States and the other coun
tries individually. Notwithstanding
the action of the Senate, therefore, in
so amending the treaties as to prevent
the exchange of ratifications, the Pres
ident will endeavor to obtain even
more tangible results through the plan
he now has in mind.
He discussed the subject of interna
tional arbitration to-day with Hayne
Davis of New York, who has made a
study of the subject, and Representa
tive Barthold of Missouri, president of
the Interparliamentary Union. Roose
velt's callers found him confident that
much could be accomplished in the
cause of arbitration at the proposed
conference at The Hague, where, he
believed, an arrangement could be
made for the arbitration of certain
specified subjects to the exclusion of
such others as mijfht cause internal
friction in the countries affected by the
terms of the agreement or strained re
lations between any two of the powers
signatory to the results of the con
ference.
DEMOCRATS IN HOUSE
OPPOSE THE PENSION BILL
Measure Is Passed After an Inef^e
tual Attempt to Reduce the
Appropriation.
Washington, Feb. is. â The
House to-day passed the pensions ap
propriation bill, carrying $138,285,200.
The minority, led by Underwood,
made an ineffectual effort to reduce
the aggregate of the appropriation so
as to exclude pensions allowed under
"Order No. 78," which, it was stated,
would involve about $4,500,000. .It
was contended that the order was
without authority of law. 9
Under a special rule the House to
day passed about twenty- flve private
bills.
SHARP DEBATE IN SENATE
ON THE STATEHOOD BILL
Action on the Request of the House
for a Conference is
Delayed.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 18.â The Sen
ate to-day decided not to admit as
testimony in the Swayne impeachment
trial' the statement made by Judge
Swayne before a House committee.
The request of the House for a con- â 
ference on the statehood bill was re
ceived and a sharp debate ensued over
an effort to have the conference com
mittee appointed immediately. The
opponents of joint statehood suc
ceeded in securing a postponement
until Monday.
House Passes Postoffice Bill.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 18. â The post- !
office appropriation bill was reported
to the Senate to-day. The principal
amendment to the bill as passed by
the House was that introduced by-
Senator Foraker for the extension of ,
the pneumatic tube service.

: To Whom It May Concern: After treat-
ing with the best physicians and specialists
for the past six years I called on Dr.
Wong Him. 'He made a simple examina-
tion by feeling the pulse and explained my
case fully. I asked him If. he could cur*
it. He said yes. in from six to eight weeks,
â¢which I can truthfully say he did. The
physicians here think him a wonder. Any
one writing me I will be only too glad ana
thankful to answer. I can cheerfully rec-
ommend him in the very worst cases of
â  eczema, as .my case was known to be one
of the most stubborn on record. Tm
X-ray was also a failure. I think Dr.
\Von_ Him one of the best doctors in '.he
United States and owe my future health to
him. Very truly,

kwn
"Mr. President: In obedience to the
command of her Majesty, the Empress
Dowager of c^\-n* i have the honor
to present to the Government of the
United States, of which you axe the
distinguished and honored Chief Mag
isira&e, the portrait of her Majesty.
which was oc exhibition at the Louisi
ana, Purchase Exposition, as a gift
from the Imperial Government of
â¢"The course of recent events In China
has proved to the world that on the
disinterested friendship of the United
States, China, can place the firmest re
liance. In order to show. In a signal
manner, her appreciation of this
friendship, her Majesty has taken ad
vantage of the opportunity afforded by
the celebration of the centennial anni
versary of the purchase by the United
States of the Territory of Louisiana.
It seems, therefore, fitting that the
portrait of her Majesty should become
the property of the United States Gov
ernment as a memorial of her abound
ing interest in the welfare and pros
perity of the American people."
President Roosevelt replied as fol
lows:
"Mr. Minister: This is for me a most
agreeable occasion. In delivering to
me, as a gift to the United States, the
portrait of her Majesty, the Empress
Dowager of China, which held a dis
tinguished place among the Chinese ex
hibits at the Louisiana Purchase Ex
position, you have appropriately ex
pressed the estimation of the disinter
ested friendship of the United States
which Is felt by the Imperial Govern
ment, which in turn testifies its recip
rocal regard and esteem for this coun
try and its people. It is fitting that
this mutual friendship should exist and
be maintained and strengthened in all
practicable ways, whether in the larger
field of international relations or by
pleasing incidents like that which
brings us together to-day.
"I am glad therefore, in the name of
the Government and people of the
United States, to accept this portrait,
which will be placed in the National
Museum as a lasting memorial of the
good will which unites the two coun
tries and the strong interest each feels
in the other's well-being and advance
ment. I beg that you will appropriate
ly convey my thanks to her Majesty,
with wishes for her health and happi
ness.''

Why Not Get the Best?
/Iff ISiill ..Us H II HiSIU^ 1 " ' / * The time is past when the successful man can do without an Encyclo-
paedia. The strides of progress are too rapid and the increase in knowledge
fil iizJtUi i/fjgÂ§f""7 is too great to admit of the guesswork of our forefathers. Nowadays the
( ; wideawake man must keep posted, and the one work which he must con-
ffi^TJm T/M f#Â¥l ilimlSFt suit, as a matter of habit, is a good Encyclopaedia. A mediocre work
will not answer; its statements are incorrect or incomplete, and leave
nit Tffjh^â^ the seeker worse off than when he began. V / I

CRAWFORDSVILLE. Ind., Feb. 18.
The funeral of General Lew Wallace
this afternoon was private in accord
ance with his expressed wishes. Only
the family and a few intimate friends
attended. Until noon the body lay in
the library building and was viewed

ory of the dead.
The casket was draped with a flag

Supervisors Roxton. B'Aneona, Al
pers, Booth, Connor, Rea, McClellan,
. Bent, Payot and Hocks were the guests
of the United Railroads yesterday,
j General Manager Chapman, General
Counsel Ford and Master Mechanic
Bodler entertaining them with a ride
over as much of the system as could
be covered with a day and with a ;
luncheon at tho Cliff House.
"Lighting, water supply and street
car service are the three utilities that
should claim the most attention from \
the Board of Supervisors because of |
the vital importance to the peo
pie," explained General Ford. "The \
l T nited Railroads wishes to have you 'â 
familiar with its properties and with |
the streetcar business. We wish to
have your control over us directed as j
intelligently as possible. We hope you .
will make thorough investigation ot
oar system, and we are ready to meet j
you at any time for a frank considora- j
tion of what we ouyni to do in the in- ;
teiest of public service. We also wish to
be dealt fairly with and intelligently, i
That there might be a better under- !
standing of things between us and j
i that the relations of the company and j
: the city might be those of good will ,
Wfc have invitod you on this excursion ,
to-day to inspoet our properties and
! see what we are doing.'
Power-houses, car barns and repair
i shops were visited. At the Valencia
stnet power-house the Supervisors ar
r'ved justXas the machinery had shut
clown that a broken strand in th>?
Huyos-v=treet cable mi^hl be repaired.
. breaking of strands ts the bane ot
! cable service. Valencia^ Hayes, Cas
tro, Haiirht and Market streets were
al a standstill during the interval re
quired by the almost frantic work of
I a large force to Bpllce Â« ire rope.
IMPROVE CROSSINGS.
Stops were maile to explain the j
trossing Improvements, by which the
jolting ot the cars at intersections of
; tracks is rc-duced to a minimum. The
: company has already expended $250,000
| for this work. In the way of figures,
it was further stated that over $500,00rt ;
has already been expended for modern
t:i'."s. such as those operated on F.llis
I s-treet. It i? the purpose to use this
pattern of cars cm all the electric lines.
They are the most approved, and, be
suU't;, uniformity is an important fac- :
tÂ«<r in economy.
Repair stocks In the amount of
$500,000 must be kept on hand with the
great diversity of cars in use at the
present time. When all the cars are of
the same make the uniformity of re
pair materials will obviate the neces
sity of so large an amount of capital
lor them. The repair work for the
company, excluding reconstruction, ag
gregates about $80,000 a month. It is
expected that tht- new repair shop at
San Jom and Ocean avenues will be
built during the present year. It will
cost about J500.000. All the work wiil
be done there, and the shops in various
parts of the city will be closed.
The company now has a bituminous
j pÃving plant of its own at the Valen
ciaÂ»Â«treet house and the experiment al- '
ready shows a saving of money. Pri- â¢
vate contractors would seem to be
making large profits.
LAST RIPE ON STFAM ROAD.
The Supervisors were treated to the
last ride over the steam road to the
Cliff House. The old cars and locomo
tives that have seen service for seven
teen years on the picturesque line will
now be relegated to the bone-yard, yes
terday's being their last trip. The
road was originally started by Adolph
Sutro, but he gave up the undertaking
at the tunnel. The Ferries and Cliff
House Company took the job off his
hands and cut the hole through the
hill. The company planned for double
; tracks, but failed in this, however, on
account of washouts. Now the United
Railroads is tearing down the hill be
cause the tunnel would not suffice, and
the roadbed has been widened alonjj
the route for double tracks on which^
trolley cars are to take the place of
steam. It is expected to have the new
: line running in two months. It will
; connect with the Sutro line at its power
i house, and there will therefore be a
\ loop service to the ocean. \
Other trips will probably be taken in
the future because the Supervisors did
not see half of the company's system.
One car of the United Railroads, if it
covered the distance that all the 450
cars travel, could make seven trips
! to the moon in a rrfenth, and it is |
I therefore apparent that the system
j cannot be inspected in one day.
There wap much jocular discussion of .
; the proposed construction of an electric ;

NOT MURDERER
OF HIS SPOUSE
Missouri Court Acquits Dr.
T. Jones Watson, Accused
of Poisoning His Wife
TRAGEDY IX RUXAWAY
Medical Men Differ in Their
Testimony as to Contents
of Stomach of Woman
NEW LONDON, Mo., Feb. 18. â The
jury in the case of Dr. T. Jones Wat
son of Denver, charged with killing
his wife, to-day returned a verdict of
not guilty. Mrs. Watson was killed in
a runaway accident while riding with
her husband, who was picked up un
conscious near a bridge over a small
stream. Mrs. Watson's body was found
in the v.aier.
The prosecution charged that Mrs.
Watson had died from the effects of
poison and that the conditions under
which her body was found had been
arranged by Dr. Watson to bear out a
runaway theory. Much expert testi
mony was> introduced at the trial, and
Dr. Watson took the stand in his own
defense. Medical men testified for the
prosecution that unmistakable traces
of poison were found in Mrs. Watsons
stomach, but other medical experts tes
tilied for the defense that there were
no traces of poison.
FOLLOWS WOMAN HOME
AND SNATCHES DIAMONDS
Highwayman Robs Xew Yorker in
Front of Her House and Fires
on Husband.
NEW YORK, Feb. 18. â One of the
most audacious of the many recent
robberies in this city occurred in the
Bronx to-day, when a highwayman at
t;.eked Mr. and Mrs. John W. Cornish
in front of their home, snatched a
$rOOO diamond brooch from Mrs. Cor
nish's throat, fired two bullets through
the clothing of Cornish when he re
monstrated and then escaped after an
exciting race with a policeman, in
which several shots were exchanged.
The police have only a meager descrip
tion of the man and there seems little
chance that he will be captured.
I The robber followed Mr and Mrs.
Cornish home from a streetcar, in
which the lavish displaj' of diamonds
worn by the couple had attracted
much attention.
WOULD FORBID DIVORCED
PERSONS TO WED AGAIN
Lower House of Montana Legislature
Passes Bill to Check Reckless
Marriages.
HELENA, Mont., Feb. 18.â The lower
branch of the Legislature has passed a
bill whose purpose is the restriction of
reckless and ill-advised marrying. Ex
cepting in the case of the innocent
party to a divorce suit brought on
statutory ground, divorced persons are
forbidden to marry again, but the pro
visions of the bill do not prevent the
parties to the action for a divorce
remarrying each other at any time.

j What Sulphur Does
Fop . the Human Body in Health
. and disease.
r . The mentiorr of sulphur will recall
to many of us the early days when
, our mothers and grandmothers gave
fur. our daily dose of sulphur and,
molasses every spring and fall.
' It was the universal spring: and fall
"blood purifier," tonic and cure-all,
and, mind you, this old-fashioned \
remedy was not without merit. . .
The idea was good, but the remedy j
was crude and unpalatable and a large
quantity, had to be taken to, get any :
ij effect.
'Nowadays we get all the beneficial j
effects of sulphur in a palatable, con- |
centrated form, so that a single grain I
is far more effective than a tablespoon- j
ful of the crude sulphur.
. In recent years research and ex- j
â periment ';, have proven that the ; best
sulphur for medicinal use is that ob- j
tamed from Calcium (Calcium Sul- <
â ^phlde) and sold in drug stores under I
. the ' name of ' Stuart's Calcium Wafers.
I.They are small, chocolate-coated pel-
. I lets, and .contain ; the active medicinal
[principle of sulphur in a highly con-
1 centrated, effective form.' â 
j Few people are 1 aware of the value
I of this form of sulphur in restoring
; and n maintaining Â, bodily vigor . and j
; health; ; sulphur acts directly on = : the
1 liver and excretory organs and purifies
; and enriches the blood by. the prompt
j elimination of ; waste material.
I Our grandmothers knew this when
1 they dosed ,us: with sulphur and" mo-
i lasses every spring and fall, but th#
J crudity v and > impurity :of - ordinary
: flowers of ' sulphur were often worse
j than " the disease and cannot compare
1 with the J modern .concentrated prepa-
I rations *of ? sulphur, of which Stuart's
{ Calcium Wafers is â  undoubtedly the
â  best and most widely used. â¢ r ,
j They are. the natural antidote for
I liver and kidney troubles and cure con-
\ stipation and purify the blood in ft way
j that of ten : surprises patient and physi-
! cian alike.' : â  ; ; v ' '
; Dr. R. : M. Wilkins, while experiment-
| ing with ; sulphur ; remedies, soon found
' that the i sulphur from Calcium was j
j superior to any r ' other form. He says: !
j "For liver, kidney and blood troubles, |
I especially when ;\ resulting ' : from con- '
> stipation- or malaria, ; I -have been sur- !
â  prised â ' at the "results obtained from j
Stuart's f Calcium Wafers. ' ; In ' : ; patients j
| suffering from boils and t pimples and '
', even V deep-seated :*: * carbuncles," I < have '
repeatedly seen r them dry up and: dis- \
j appear, in four or five days, leaving the '
1 skin ; clear J and smooth. 7 , Although !
i Stuart's Calcium : ; Wafers lis a : proprie-
I tary article.; and sold by druggists and
I or. : that I reason tabooed * by i many phy- :
j sicians, yet ; I â  know of , nothing so ; safe
! and ; reliable for : constipation, . liver and â¢
} kidney troubles Â£ and i especially) 1 ; in all I
I forms of skin diseases as this remedy.". |
I v?a At * any i rate . people - who are ;. tired \of J
pills, r ; r cathartics and so-called blood ,
"purifiers" will find tin; Stuart's Cal-
â . cium Wafers ; a far ; safer, more - palat- ' i

PARTY LEADERS

6p*cial Dibpatch to ThÂ« C*.U.
B( iSTON. Feb. 18.â A powerful clique
if Democratic leaders here has been
i rmed for an organized revolt against
William R. Hearst and his system of
terrorism against those who oppose
him. The plan is to have Congressman
jihn A. Sullivan of Boston, whom he
recently attacked in CrTngress, head the
Movement in Washington, with the
backing of John Sharp Williams and
ether strong leaders, while equally
powerful men carry on the work quiet

NEW PARIS FASHIONS
IX FIXE JEWELRY
Some Xo\ pities in Rrf>rwljes, Pendants,
Pins and Rings.
Balls and feasts of all kinds are at
thoir heipht, and the leading jewelers
are vying with each other in order to
promote the attractiveness of their
exhibits.
Pendants and brooches stand pre
eminent among these beautiful dis
plays. Their decoration is pimple and
effective. Nude figures of women,
flowers and foliage or Insects are the
most favored motifs. Pearls and opals
add to the beauty of these magnificent
jewels.
Sash buckles present the same sim
plicity of decoration. The large and
complicated designs of recent years
are superseded by smaller ones, which
are thorough works of art. The most
attactive patterns represent light
flowers, such as forget-me-nots, daisies,
bindweeds, etc.
Back combs and hairpins are pro
fusely shown. Two new and exquisite
hairpins, whose prongs are of light tor
toise shell, are headed with a charming
floral decoration artistically enameled.
Marquise rings are still much in de
mand. The latest creations in this
taking style are appealing strongly to
feminine taste. They come of gold of
different hues, handsomely chased, and
are adorned with dainty floweret?, en
hanced with opals, rubies or saphires.
A strikingly varied line of umbrella
handles is shown. Some of the most
effective patterns are of chased matt
gold. An original crooked handle is
adorned with flowers. Another is a
heron's head and another an eagle's
head. Rubies serve as eyes.
Ostrich feather fans are all the rage
among fashionable women. Shell, pearl
or ivory are among the most fashion
able sticks, -while the mountings are of
gold chased in open work.
Party card trays are of matt gold or
oxidized silver, elaborately chased, and
adorned with mistletoe branches. In
this order I saw a superb tray of
chased matt gold adorned with a swan
Fwimmlng between reeds. EnameJ of
different hues added to the richness of
effect of this beautiful tray.
DANGER OF RACE
SUICIDC IX FRANCE
Mairiages Few. Divorces Many, and
Birth Halo Xotably
Small.
The race suicide question in France
is so often referred to that any official
figures throwing light on recent phases
of the matter are eagerly awaited.
The Journal Official has Just pub
lished the figures for the year 1903,
which show that there Is still an excess
of births over deaths, although this
margin is gradually decreasing. There
is no encouragement in this fact, how
ever, because the ratio of deaths to
births, compared with other countries,
is ridiculously small. A partial ex
planation is found in the fact that
though the number of marriages
shows a slight increase numerically,
the number of divorces is increasing
very much faster. The slight gain In
population is due entirely to the rela
tively better health of the nation, as
the births in 1903 were numerically
the smallest in ten years. The follow
ing comparatively birth ratio statistics
are enlightening: Exross of births over
deaths per 10,000 iiihabitantÃ: France,

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, FEBRUARY 19, 1905.
UNION PACIFIC
AGAIN TO FORE
Makes Another Big Advance
on Wall Street and Leads
Other Stocks on Market
Special DiÃpatch to The Ca.ll.
NEW YORK, Feb. 18.â The contest
which started between E. H. Harriman
and James J. Hill in 1901 for the control
of the Northern Pacific road, and
which has been a disturbing factor in
Wall street ever since, although appar
ently settled by the formation of the
Northern Securities Company, appears
to have now taken the shape of a con
test for a controlling interest in the
Union Pacific itself, between the Harri
man and Hill parties. To-day, three
houses appeared at the opening with
heavy buying orders in Union Pacificâ
Strong, Sturgis & Co.; Edward Sweet
& Co. and Charles Menzesheimer & Co.
The scramble at opening between these
and others was so great that the stock
sold at 126%, 12Â«i4 and 126% at the same
moment in different parts of the crowd
and whenever an offer was made one
of these three firms fought to obtain
the stock.
Buying for foreign account also was
a leading element in the movement.
It was believed that the small effect
on foreign markets of the tragedy in
Russia prompted buying of stocks, but
the demand for the Northern Securi
ties group was more adequately ex
plained by the knowledge that favor
able statements of the earnings of the
constituent companies were published
in London this afternoon. Southern
Pacific and St. Paul made moderate
response- to the Union Pacific move
ment, but there was not much in the
market otherwise outside of the spe
cialities.
Stocks connected with the leading
industries were strong, and there were
rumors of plans for combination. The
discussion of a possible strike of New
Haven firemen was an influence in the
market. There was a special move
ment in Chicago Great Western and
rumors were current of a probable
absorption of this property in the in
terest of larger competing systems
The bank statement was more favor
able than expected.
Union Pacific closed buoyantly, but
some pressure at other points made
the closing of the market irregular.
The total sales of bonds, par value
were $830,000.
The occasional strength shown by
stocks this week has been most
marked in special stocks and has
been mixed with reactions at times
and with steady realizing in some
stocks at all times. The realizing was
in stocks that have enjoyed wide ad
vances in tbe previous trading, and
the selling represented successful

Old Trees.
An old yew tree stands in the
churchyard at Fortingal, in Perthshire,
which De Candolle, nearly a century
ago proved to the satisfaction of bot
anists to be twenty-flve centuries old,
and another is still standing at Hed
sor, In Buclas, which is 3240 years old
How- De Candolle arrived at an appar
ently correct estimate of the enormous
age of these living trees is a simple
thing, and the principle is doubtless
well known to-day to all. The yew,
like most other trees, adds one line,
about the tenth of an inch, to its cir
cumference each year. But the oldest
living thing In the world to-day, so far
as known, is a cypress tree in Chapul
tepec, Mexico, that is 6260 years old.â

CODY QUARRELS
TOLD IN COURT
Witnesses Relate Details
of Differences Between
Buffalo Bill and Wife
CASE NEAR ITS END
Attempt at Reconciliation
Made at the Time of the
Daughters Death Fails
CHEYENNE, Wyo., Feb. 18.â With
the exception of two or three witnesses
yet to come the hearing of evidence for
Colonel William F. Cody (Buffalo Bill)
In his suit for divorce was closed to
day.
Dr. D. Frank Powell (White Beaver),
manager of Colonel Cody's extensive
Interests in Northern Wyoming, testi
fied that he had known Cody for thirty
bix years and Mrs. Cody for thirty-five
years. At the time of the death of
j MrÃ. Arta Thorps (Colonel and Mrs.
j Cody's daughter) last year, Dr. Powell
I met the Cody party in Chicago and ac
| companied them to Rochester, N. Y.
' While in Rochester, Colonel Cody re
' quested Dr. Powell to see Mrs. Cody
and try to effect a reconciliation. With
j this object in view Dr. Powell called
on Mrs. Cody.
After he had explained his errand he
i said Mrs. Cody exclaimed angrily: "I
; do-nt want anything to do with any
I one from Colonel Cody. He is rotten.
! I will bring those Codys down so loW
that even the dogs won't bark at them,
and furthermore I will this day de
nounce him at the grave of his own
daughter."
"Cody appeared all broken up over
i the failure of the negotiations, as he
\ was apparently sincere in desiring a
I reconciliation," said the witness.
On cross-examinatipn Dr. Powell ad
mitted that Cody had telegraphed to
Mrs. Cody in Denver when the news
of Mrs. Thorps' death had reached him,
asking for a temporary truce during
the funeral, and Mrs. Cody had wired
back that only a permanent recon
ciliation would be agreed to by her,
and that this telegram was not an
. swered by Colonel Cody.
For the defense. Major Lester Walk-
I er, ex-Mayor of North Platte, Neb.,
â¢ and an intimate friend of Colonel and
1 Mrs. Cody for almost forty years, was
I called. He declared he had never ob
| served Mrs. Cody show the slightest
act of discourtesy toward her husband
or her husband's guests.
In refutation of the testimony on be
half of the plaintiff that Colonel Cody
sought a reconciliation, but that Mrs.
Cody refused to accede to this, it was
brought out by Major Walker that he
saw Mrs. Cody just after she received
the news ot the death of her daughter,
and Mrs. Cody said to him: "I am in
hopes the death of our darling will be
the cause of bringing about a recon
ciliation between myself and the
colonel."
At the afternoon session fifteen let- :
ters from Colonel Cody to his wife were
road. These letters were written in
1900 and 1901. at a time when, it is
stated, strained relations existed be
tween the couple. The letters were
overflowing: with affection and esteem
and shuwed that at that time Colonel
Cody had fhe greatest respect for his
wife's business ability.
RICHARD CROKEJR GIVES
LIBERALLY IN ENGLAND
Former Tammany Boss of New York
Known for Kindness to
Ihe Poor.
LONDON, Feb. 18. â Richard;
Croker's recent contribution of $125 to
the fund for the relief of the victims
of the big bog slide in Ireland is only |
â¢ one of the many proofs which may be
cited that here, as he did in New York '
I when he was Tammany's "boss," he
! assiduously practices that virtue which
â covers a multitude of sins. It may
! also be put down to his credit that he
j never advertises his charities.
Knprlish society, believing that his ;
wealth acquired by political
blackmail and corruption, has always
ignored him, but among the poor he is
undoubtedly popular. The inhabitants
j of the little Berkshire village of Wan
; tage, where he resided for several
years, deeply deplored the removal of
his racing establishment to Ireland
1 and were loud in their expressions of j
indignation when it was announced '
! that the Jockey Club had refused to
! allow his horses to be trained on New- j
' market Heath.
The poor around Stillogara, his
pretty place in the vicinity of Dub
lin, are now the special objects of his
beneficence, and it is hardly an exag
geration to say that none need go
hungry who are fortunate enough to
live in his neighborhood.
Xew Press Decoration.
PARIS, Feb. 18. â Hitherto the
French journalists have been satis
fied with a meager salary, knowing
they stood an excellent chance of re
ceiving a decoration from the Gov
ernment. The Matin has now re
versed the order by founding a medal
of honor for distribution among per
sons having no official distinction. As
a result few persons In this country

Life Sentence for Petty Theft.
NICE, Feb. 18. â A fisherman of 24.
who while drunk robbed a man of 80
cents, has Just been sentenced, owing
to an error of the Jury, to penal ser
vitude for life as being guilty of high
way robbery with violence without
extenuating circumstances. It was ad
mitted that the tribunal had no al
ternative but to pronounce the maxi

be necessary for a rectification of the
sentence. The prisoner's father faint

Dueling Club in Paris.
PARIS, Feb. 18. â rDr. de Villers, a
well-known physician, has founded a
dueling club in Paris. Meetings are
held in a gymnasium, the object being
to familiarize the use of pistols under
conditions similar to those of a real
encounter. The duelists wear masks,
gauntlets and thick blouses and fire
hollow wax bullets of special manu
facture, permitting excellent marks
manship. Many leading Parisians
have joined the club, and its weekly
meetings are very popular.

MIKES PLEA
FOR JUSTICE,
NOT MERCY
Grove L. Johnson Spends
Entire Day in Demanding;
From Jury Acquittal of
His Client. Adolph Weber !
SCORES MRS. SNOWDEN,
AUNT OF PRISONER
Declares That Vindictive
ness of Woman Caused the
Arrest of the Suspect and
Hints at Mercenary Motive
Bpeolal_ Dispatch to ThÂ» CaJl.
AUBURN, Feb. 18.â "We do not ask
for mercy; we ask for justice; Justice,
Justice and the law."
With these words Attorney Grove L.
Johnson, head counsel for Adolph
Weber, the Auburn youth who has been
! on trial for the murder of his mother,
closed the first chapter of hia appeal
to the jury on behalf of his client. He
, will finish his argument on Monday
morning. The scene in court to-day
during Johnson's appeal to the Jury
was a remarkable one. The big room
was crowded with men, women and
children. Even the steps leading to
Judge Prewett's rostrum were utilized
as vantage points by the curious. Hun
; dreds of persons were unable to gain
admittance to the courtroom. These
unfortunates remained about the court
house all day, being repaid for their
long and tiresome vigil by an occas
ional echo from the courtroom. Those
of the gentler sex who were lucky
enough to obtain seats kept them dur
ing the entire proceedings, even dur
ing the lunch hour. Many of the
women were at the courthouse as early
: as 8 o'clock, so anxious were they to
hear Johnson's argument.
Weber's demeanor during the argu
ment of his counsel puzzled those who
have watched the accused youth from
the day of his arrest. When Attorney
1 Hamilton for the prosecution, In his
four hours' speech yesterday, Bcored
Weber unmercifully at regular inter
vate, the youth smiled. At times he
squirmed in his seat, nut never for a
moment did he appear downcast.
When District Attorney Kelly Robinson
called him a liar and said, "as sure as
I am standing here Adolph Weber mur
dered his mother." Weber still smiled.
To-day, however, not a smile Illum
inated his features. During all the
time Johnson talked, Weber, with
flushed face, nervously twitching hands,
sat by his attorney's side. Not once
daring the long argument did he take j
his eyes off his defender. When a re- !
cess was declared he clung close to ]
Johnson as would a dog to a kind mas- j
ter, discovered after years spent in re
ceiving kicks and buffets from the |
world. It was the same when Johnson j
resumed his argument at the afternoon
session. The kind words that fell from
Johnson's lips were as food to Weber, i
for kind words for him have been
scarce, since that awful night of last
November. They brought a flush to â

INTERESTS SPECTATORS.
Johnson began his argument at about
11 o'clock this morning, shortly after
Attorney Tuttle, one of his assistants,
had addressed the Jury, and made a
plea for the acquittal of Weber. John
son was in fine voice and soon after
warming up to his subject won the un
divided attention of the big crowd. He
spent some time In explaining to the
jurors the law on circumstantial evi
dence and its value where the life of a
fellow man was at stake. He declared
that the jury was not there to decide
whether the defendant had committed
the awful crime with which he is
charged, but to determine whether the
prosecution had established the guilt of
the defendant beyond a reasonable
doubt. Johnson quoted liberally from
the poets and at times was dramatic in
the extreme.
It was whne Johnson attacked the
methods of the prosecution that his au
dience began to display great interest.
When he first *mentioned the name of
Mrs. Snowden his hearers pricked up
their ears. They were not disappointed
in their expectations that Johnson
would deal harshly with Mrs. Weber's
sister. Johnson scored Mrs. Snowden
almost to the limit, declaring that it
was mainly through her Idle words
that the dreadful charge that he mur
dered his mother was placed against
Adolph Weber.
"The vindictlveness of this woman."
declared Johnson, "Is surprising.
From that awful night on the 10th of
last November up to this very hour she
has sought to harm him, her dead sis
ter's child. She has hired an attorney
to assist In the prosecution of her
nephew. This attorney, Lee Chamber
lain, has not been allowed to publicly
appear in the prosecution of this boy,
but nevertheless it is a fact that he has
been retained by this Mrs. Snowden.
"The prosecution has commented on
the conduct of this defendant on the
night of the tragedy and on the days
following. They have not commented
on the conduct of this woman. Mrs.
Snowden talked louder than any of the
hundred or more witnesses summoned
to the stand by the prosecution. It is j
she who seeks to hang the son of her
murdered sister. If the boy is convict- j
ed, who is the gainer? Who are the !
heirs to the wealth of Julius Weber? I
You know as well as we do."
EXCUSE FOR THREAT.
Johnson laid particular stress upon !
Mrs. Snowden's statement that the day j
after the fire Adolph Weber had said
to her "Your turn is coming next." I
Johnson did not deny that Weber had '
made the threat, and in explanation he
said:
"This boy did not mean that the fate
that befell his mother would be that of
Mrs. Snowden. He meant that she
would be branded in the columns of the
press as he had been branded In an ar- !
tide he claimed had been suggested by '
his aunt."
Iri closing his argument for the day j
Johnson said:
"There is no testimony here that
warrants the conviction of this boy.
We want no compromise verdict. W r e
are not asking for mercy. We want j
you to abide by the law and render '
your decision on the testimony you â 
have heard. If on this testimony you i
find him guilty of this most horrible I
crime he must hang. If the prosecu
tion has failed to Drove to you that j
he has committed this crime, and you i
must know that they have failed, then j
the boy should go free. You can take i
life; can you restore life? No. No. j
The days of miracles have passed. [
You may feel a moral certainty of the I
defendant's guilt, but that Is not J
enough. You must be legally certain |
of that guilt. You must not be con
vinced as men; you must be convinced
as jurors.
"There are many points In this evi
dence that we dispute; we dispute the

fraudulent showing in the interest of
ex-Governor Peabody; and
"Whereas, It is meet and proper that
we should see and know the parties

Uricsol,
the only cure for
Rheumatism.
If you are suffering from rheuma-
tism there is a chance for yon to be-
come absolutely cured. You may
cure yourself and do it quickly if you
will lay - side your prejudice and
skepticism.
Every San Francisco drugsist sells
Uricsol, the well-known r#medy, and
we hereby authorize them to guaran-
tee a cure.
Uricsol cures rheumatism in the
only possible way it can be cured.
Uric Acid and Urates are the cause
of Rheumatism. These are deposited
in the tissues, blood vessels and joints
of the body.
These deposits must be dissolved
and eliminated from the system be-
fore a cure can be accomplished.
Uricsol is a solvent of these and
tones up the system, stimulates the
kidneys, liver and bowels and thus
drives them from the system.
Uricso! is harmless, and no injuri-
ous results can possibly come to any
part of your body.

Has Met With Foul Play
DESERTS HIS LODGINGS
Worry Over Shooting Mishap
May Have Upset Mind of
Man Who Has Disappeared

bleau, employed as a porter at the Park
Hotel, has been missing since last Sun
day and his employer, Captain H. H.
Todd. fears that he has done away
with himself or has met with foul play.
Etableau, who is a half-brother of San
itary Inspector Eugene C. Mailott, has
acted as if deranged for some time,
and it was his habit to keep a shotgun
in his room at the Park Hotel, as he
imagined that an enemy from Mexico
would assassinate him. He Insisted
that he be changed from one room to
another bo as to throw his visionary
foe off the trail.
Etableau is about 40 years of age and
spent his boyhood here. Years ag&
while out hunting with Tom Cleveland
and Alex Laplant of this city Etableau
accidentally wounded Cleveland and,
fearing the consequences, shipped as a
sailor and later joined the Chilean
navy. Etableau inherited property in
Alameda from his mothers estate val

formed that his missing porter was
seen in San Francisco this week and

AWFUL RECORD MADE
ON CAPE COD SHORES
Five Hundred and Forty Wrecks Have
Occurred There in Twenty-
Three Years.
Major J. H. Willard of the United
States Engineer's office at Newport has
prepared a map of the coast from
Fishers leland, Conn., to Cape Cod
which shows the approximate location
of 1076 marine disasters within that
territory, 60 of which occurred prior to
1880 and the balance between 1880 and
1903. There are four distinct groups of
wrecks on the map, the principal one
being off Cape Cod. Five hundred and
forty wrecks, or more than half of
those recorded, occurred off the north
ern, eastern and southern shores of
that peninsula. The other groups are
off Block Island, Point Judith and
Watch Hill. These four groups com
prise all but about sixty wrecks, which
are scattered along the shores of Nan
tucket, Martha's Vineyard and Buz
zards Bay. A footnote states that
many more disasters have occurred at
Vineyard Haven than those indicated
and that thirty-four vessels were said
to have been driven ashore or other
w lse damaged In the November storm
of 1898. but no record of these wrecks
is at present available.
Four hundred and forty-seven of the
wrecks occurred in Rhode Island wa
ters. Of the vessels which sailed about
Block Island 147 succumbed to the
storms which swept that vicinity, the
eastern shore of the island being the
scene of the greater part of the disas
ters. In the neighborhood of Point Ju
dith, Narragansett Pier and Newport
157 vessels were wrecked, eighty of
which were off Point Judith, twenty
four along the shore of Narragansett
Pier, fourteen in the West Passage,
between Jamestown and Narragansett,
and thirty-nine between and to the
south of Jamestown and Newport.
The last important group includes
sixty-four off Watch Hill, twenty-five
off Fishers Island and Stcmington Har
bor and seventeen along the coast be
tween Watch Hill and Point Judith.
One wreck is charted just inside of the
Sakonnet River, off the east shore of
the Island of Rhode Island, and a dot
at the northern end of Conanicut Isl
and indicates a solitary wreck well in
side the protected water of Narragan
eett Bay. â Chicago Tribune.
British Railways In 1903.
The net receipts of the railways of
the United Kingdom were greater in
1903 than in any of the preceding fif
teen years, amounting to $211,634,295,
and this notwithstanding the fact that
the working expenses for the year were
also higher than during the years
named. The lines in England and
Wales were, in proportion to the gross
receipts, the most costly to work, and
Scottish lines the most economical. The
ratio of expenditure to gross receipts in
1889 and 1903 were as follows: English
lines, 52 and 63 per cent; Scottish lines,
49 and 55 per cent; Irish lines. 54 and 61
per cent.
The increase in the paid-up capital of
the combined railways in 1903 amounted
to nearly $150,000,000, practically the
whole of which was required by the
lines In England and Wales. The cross
receipts of all lines Increased by $7,000,
000, nearly the whole of which was
earned by the English and Welsh lines,
whose length of lines open increased
over 1902 by 141 miles, the Scotch by
84 and the Irish by 56, the total increase
being 281 miles. The number of pas
sengers carried again increased, total
ing for the United Kingdom 1.195.
265,195, exclusive of season ticket hold
ers, compared with 775,193,073 in 1889.â

PI DELTA KAPPA
DANCE IS EVENT
OF THE SEASON
ZOE GREEN RADCLIFFE
OAKLAND, Feb. 18.â The lights that
plowed redly upon the merry maze of
men and maids at the Pi Delta Kappa
dance last night were not more rosy
than the dreams that have been
dreamed for weeks past of what pleas
ure this particular function would
give. Much credit Is due the energetic
committee of arrangements that antic
ipations were realized and that their
dance was one of the prettiest affairs
of the season. The decoration of Reed
Hall was never before so effective or
so brilliant.
Hundreds of pennants, scarlet, with
the Greek letters of various fraterni
ties in white. Muttered overhead from
scarlet streamers stretched from the
central chandelier to walls and gal
lery. All the chandeliers were con
cealed In a feathery arrangement of
brake ferns and long grasses, the cen
ter lights being softened with red
globes. The orchestra, which gave us
some very inspiring music, by the way,
A vas tucked away in a perfect bower
of palms and ferns.
It is always hard to pick out the
prettiest girl in an Oakland crowd â we
have such a lot of pretty girls on this
side of the bay, and they were there
by the score last nightâ but Miss Trixie
igoe was, in the minds of many,
worthy of that distinction at the P. D.
K. dance. Her dress was a marvel of
pale blue chiffon and silver embroidery,
and the stunning mandarin coat that
enveloped her petite form when she
left the ballroom was the finishing
touch to a very charming picture.
.Miss Hazel Palmanteer, in a dainty,
girlish gown of figured organdie, was
one of the attractive girls in the room,
and so was Miss Ruth Houghton in a
similar becoming gown.
Miss Vera Cope's pink frock, with its
thin skirts and deep, graceful berthe,
was one of the noticeable gowns, and
Miss Blanche Laymance in pale pink
silk looked unusually well.
Among others who wore very charm
ing and dainty gowns were Miss Flor
ence Edmundson of San Francisco,
Miss Gladys Coffin, Miss Edith Coffin,
Miss Winte Perkins, Miss Carmen
Percy, Miss Katherine Brown, Miss
Evelyn Adams. Miss Bessie Haven,
Miss Laura Haven, Miss Gertrude
Bell, Miss Katherine McElrath, Miss
Edna Prather, Miss Edna Lenhardt
and Miss Clara Franck.
The patronesses were Mrs. George
Percy, Mrs. W. G. Palmanteer, Mrs.
Louis F. Cockroft and Mrs. Harry P.
Carlton. The committee which worked
so hard to make the affair a success
was composed of Leslie Hayes, Leslie
Rice, George Couradi and Harry Gray.
Â». â¢ â¢
It Is evident that we Westerners are
still wild and woolly In many respects
and if one may judge by the rising
generation, Oakland will continue to
be wild and woolly for some decades to
come The P. D. K. dance last night
was a brilliant social success and bet
ter â¢ managed than the majority â of
these affairs are, but even there the
lack of courtesy in introducing strang
ers - was evident. Many of the lads
and lassies who came from San Fran
cisco ; to attend the affair had to :be
content with, i about half the : number
of dances on 'the programme, while
the Oakland boys in several instances
.danced eight or nine times with , the
same girl. . It appears this matter â . of
introduction is managed 'â _ much better
in the East. One of the chaperones
told me last night that there the pat
ronesses, instead of being tucked off
into one corner of the hall, as is cus
tomary here, act as hostesses. >1. The
dancers are received and ; introduced
by them as in a private home, and it
is their duty to see that there are no
wall flowers. A very pleasant way,
surely, that might be inaugurated
here very satisfactorily. ' * '

charge placed against him.
Ibanovich was arrested by Detective
Quigley and made no protest against
going to jail. He said that the chil

at will by their mother, that they
were not being cared for, that the
man who had married their mother
was not providing for them and that
he had as much right to them as their

BLIXD MAN RATED Â«
AS GOOD ELECTRICIAN
Passed Official examination and Now
Contracts to Wire Houses and
Install, Dynanios.
The idea that blind people are ca
pable only of exercising certain hack
neyed professions, such as brush,
basket and mat making has been tri
umphantly refuted by S. Ferris, a
resident of Swindon, who, though to
tally sightless, carries on a most suc
cessful business as a practical electri
cian in that town.
Mr. Ferris gained the requisite
knowledge of the business at the
Swindon technical schools, winning
four certificates and two first prizes
in competition with seeing students.
His principal, Mr. Knowles, had no
hesitation in leaving him in full
charge of the engine and dynamos.
Mr. Ferris has since carried out sev
eral contracts for the installation of
electric light to the entire satisfac
tion of the Swindon corporation en
gineer and his customers, and has re
cently secured a fresh contract for
wiring and fitting ten houses.
The blind electrician Judges the di
rection and distance of surrounding
objects by the echo of his own foot
steps, and is thus enabled to steer
chear of obstacles. He never uses a
walking-stick.
Mr. Ferris' method of wood-turning
Is to hold the machine tool in the
right hand only and allow the fingers
of the left to rest on the revolving
work, so that he may detect if it Is
being accurately done. He grinds and
sharpens his own instruments, also
cutlery of all kinds. â London Mail.
Wide Awake Is Corral.
Vice President Corral of Mexico is
a civilian. He saw his only military
service during a revolution in the fron
tier State of Sonora, of which he is a
native, and as the revolution was of
short duration he came out of the con
flict with but little practical knowledge
of warfare. He knows more about
public lighting, street traction and
municipal drainage, for he has studied
these subjects in the great cities of
the United States and Europe. He be
lieves that the greatest need of the
Mexican people is education and that
the future of the country depends to a
large extent on the building up of a
substantial middle class. He holds
that too many pt the young men of
Mexico are entering the priesthood and
the legal profession and in the hope of
inducing Mexican youths to devote
their lives to useful arts and trades he
is promoting the establishment of a
Mexican institute of technology that
will rival similar institutions of other
countries. â Chicago Chronicle.
Counterfeiting Furs.
The natural result of the enormous
prices of furs has been the counter
feiting of valuable skins by dyeing
and otherwise manipulating such
cheap pelts as rabbit, muskrat, goat,
etc. Some of the commoner forms
of imitation are as follows: Muskrat,
or nutria (.a South American rodent,
the coypu), dyed and sold as seal;
rabbit dyed and sold as seal; white
rabbit sold as ermine; fitch (small
animal belonging to the weasel famÂ«
ily), dyed and sold as sable; mink,
sold as sable; goat, dyed and sold as
bear.
In Great Britain this fraud is pun

practiced nevertheless. â New York

Qneer Use of Common Phrase.
One of the most famous criminals the
old Tombs Prison in New York held in
many years had just been placed in
his cell. His name is a familiar one
and he was involved in a recent Wall
street scandal. The delinquent in this
case has always been friendly with the
newspaper men and when he was ar
rested several reporters who had known
him hastened to the Tombs, confident
of obtaining an interview. He refused
to be seen and his message to them,

eminently characteristic: "Tell them,"

OPEN CAMPAIGN
FOR GOOD ROADS
Automobile Club of Califor
nia Holds First Annual
Banquet at St. Francis
PEOMINENT MEN ATTEND
Interesting VaudeviUe and
Musical Programme Dur
ing the Progress of Feast
If a campaign for good roads
throughout the State is not strenuously
waged from now on, it will not be the
fault of the Automobile Club of Cali
fornia, From speeches made last night
at the St. Francis Hotel, on occasion of
the first annual banquet of that organ
ization, the tenor of every speaker's re
marks was for the improvement of the
city and State roads. Not only was
this urged from the viewpoint of the
autoist, but from that of every citizen
who knows that good roads would be
of public benefit.
The banquet served to do more to
ward furthering the interests of speed
machines and the bringing together of
autoists from all over the State than
any number of formal conventions
could have done. There was through
out the evening a feeling of good fel
lowship that argued well for co-opera
tion in the cause the club is pledged to
â that of good roads.
In the beautiful white and gold ball
room of the St. Francis, with its large
floor space, were ranged three long ta
bles, extending the length of the room.
At these, in six long rows, sat more
than four hundred members of the club
and their guests. At one end of the
tables -was a smaller table at which
were the officers of the club and the
guests of honor. Among these were
Mayor Schmitz; R. P. Schwerin, presi
dent of the Automobile Club; S. G.
Buckbee, treasurer; S. J. Frey, secre
tary. J. D. Spreckels, vice president of
the club, was absent.
UNIQUE ENTERTAINMENT.
At the other end of the long tables
was an elevated platform, on which
Young Corbett and Joe Qans gave an
exhibition boxing bout and from which
Kolb and Dill and Barney Bernard en
livened the evening with witty anec
dotes. During the dinner music added
to the gayety of those present.
After the coffee had been served R. P.
Schwerin, who acted as toaatmaster,
made a few introductory remarks. He
spoke in behalf of the organization of
the auto club, which was formed two
years ago and has since grown in mem
bership. He urged that the members
aid In carrying out the laws made by
various County Supervisors so that the
autoists should gain the name of being
law-abiding citizens and not a menace
to drivers of horses. He asked the
members not to countenance hoodlum
ism in" any form.
"We propose to show that we have
none among us who shoot out street
lights, ring door bells and insult women
from automobiles, and we propose to
aid in the searching out and imprison
ing of those that do such thinsrs. We
have a beautiful city here and the
stronger this organization becomes the
better streets and roads we will have.
But we do not expect consideration we
do not merit, and we want to discour
age any illegal use of the highways."
MAYOR WANTS CLEAN STREETS.
Mayor Schmitz was the next SDeaker
and confined his remarks principally to
the necessity of good roads, and ursed
that all citizens, no matter what mieht
be their politics, should combine to se
cure municipal improvements and jrood.
roads. His Honor took occasion to di
gress for several minutes while he ex
plained his position- in the demand for
clean streets, and said that money
should instantly be voted to secure the
cleanliness of San Francisco's thor
oughfares.
M. H. de Toung told some Interesting
anecdotes of autos and horses in the
streets of London, Paris, Berlin and
San Francisco. He said that the auto
had come to stay, as evidenced by the
manufacture of 28,000 during: last year,
and told of the many uses to which
the speed machines may be put. Su
pervisor Braunhart and Herbert E.
Law also spoke on the need of good
roads. Ex-Mayor James D. Phelan in
a short speech on behalf of the club
presented a silver loving cup to Presi
dent Schwerin.
The amusement programme consist
ed of piano selections by Georsre Car
lyle and the singing of the "Torea
dor" song from "'Carmen." and "La
Paloma" by Senor E. Robles of recent
bullfight fame. Senor Robles displayed
further versatility by refereeinj? a
three-round go between Twin Sullivan
and Tommy West Wilson of the vau

Irish comedians. Quigley brothers, and
Douglas and Ford in singing and danc
ing specialties were also enioved.

TALE OF POISON
CAUSES ALARM
Indisposition of Mrs. Jane
Stanford Starts a Rumor
That Is Quickly Denied
EXAGGERATED INCIDENT
Mineral Water Eesults in
Xauseation and a Sen
sational Story Follow^
A sensational story that had been la
circulation for several days to the ef
fect that an attempt had been made to
I poison Mrs. Jane Stanford at her home
on California street was emphatically
t denied yesterday by her friend*. Ac
cording to the story that had rapidly
spread about town, Mrs. Stanford had
drunk some mineral water that made
her 111 Â«.nd an analysis of the liquid had
later revealed the fact that it con
tained poison. The story continued to
tell how Mrs. Stanford, suffering from
nervous prostration resu.ting from the
effects of the poison, had been ordered
abroad by her physicians. In com
pany with her private secretary, Miss
i Benner, Mrs. Stanford left for the
Orient on the steamship Korea several
days ago.
The facts of the caae are that, about
seven weeks ago, Mrs. Stanford one
morning drank a glass of mineral wa
ter, which nauseated her for a few mo
ments and on the advice of friends she
had the water analyzed but without
sensational results. Being of a nerv
ous temperament, she turned the mat
ter over to a local firm of detectives,
which, after a day's Investigation,
satisfied her that no attempt had been
made to injure her and the affair waa
finally told to her friends as a Joke.
Professor David Starr Jordan, presi
dent of Stanford University, rtf erring
to the matter last evening said:
"The report that Mrs. Stanford left
for the Orient because of an attempt
at poisoning is entirely unfounded.
The fact Is that Mrs. Stanford wu
threatened with pneumonia and her
physician advised a warmer climate
than San Francisco. It was for this
reason alone that she started on her
trip. She did. howler, tell me a month
ago that she had been served with a
bottle of mineral water which had a
peculiar taste, but she did not drink
It. She did not think for a minute that
any attempt was being made to poison
her, and I do not believe there was."
CHRISTMAS SEASON
HARD OX HORSES
More Than Two Hundred and Fifty
Fall In Street Sick as Result
of Overfeeding.
When the various societies for the re
lief of animals opened their offices in
Philadelphia Tuesday, after the double
holiday, they received calls from all
parts of the city requesting them to r -
move horses stricken with paralysis.
These calls were so numerous as to be
startling. In the words of an officer of.
one of the societies, horses seemed to
be dropping like flies all over town.
The Pennsylvania society received
eighteen calls between 7:30 and 9 a. m.
Before the end of the day they had re
moved fifty horses. At the woman's
branch of the society there was a simi
lar condition of affairs, that society
dealing with more than forty cases.
From the veterinary hospital of the
University of Pennsylvania the ambu
lance was traveling all day. and about
forty cases ware treated. The ambu
lances of many large concerns which
have their own facilities for the relief
of horses were also overtaxed. The un
precedented prevalence of the malady
is attributed to the overfeeding of thÂ«
horses In warm stables while they were
idle because of the double holiday.
A peculiar feature of the situation Is
the fact that the suffering horses were
the property of large concerns from
which the animals receive the best of
care. A moderate estimate of the num
ber of horses affected would be from
250 to 300. The majority of cases were
fatal, entailing a loss of thousands of
dollars.
The disease is technically known m
azoturia. and is commonly referred to
as spinal meningitis. It Is usually fatal,
except In the cases of exceptionally
young and vigorous horses.âPhiladel

Somethiiis You Can Sec in Any Res-

A physician puts the query: Have ,
you never noticed in any large restau- !
rant jit lunch or dinner time the large!
number of hearty, vigorous old men at i
the tables; men whose ages run from 60 ;
to Â£0 years; many of them bald and all
perhaps gray, but none of them feeble ,
or senile? â¢
Perhaps the spectacle is so common j
as to have escaped your observation or j
comment, but nevertheless it is an ob- !
joct lesson which means something.
If you will notice what these hearty
r>ld .chows are eating you will observe
:-.Bt they are not munching bran crack-
ers nor gingerly picking their way
through a menu card of new-fangled
neaith foods: on the contrary, they
feem to prefer a juicy roast of beef, a
properly turned loin of mutton, and
even the deadly broiled lobster is not
altogether ignored.
The pcint of all this is that a vigor-
ous old age depends upon good diges-
tion and plenty of wholesome food, and
r-rt upon dieting and an endeavor to
Uve upon bran crackers.
There is a certain class of food cranks
who seem to believe that meat, coffee
and many other good things are rank
persons, but these cadaverous, sickly-
lookinjr individuals are a walking con-
demnation of their own theories.
The matter, in a nutshell, is that if
the stomach secretes the natural di-
pestiv* Juices !n sufficient Quantities
eny wholesome food will be promptly
digested; if th* stomach does not do bo.
and certain foods cause distress, one or
two of Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets after
pach meal will remove all difficulty, be-
cause they supply just what every
Teak stomach lacksâ hydro-
chloric acia. diastase and nux.
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets do not
act upon the bowels, and. th fact, are
not strictly a medicine, as they act al-
most entirely upon the food eaten, di-
gesting it thoroughly, and thus give a
much needed rest and giving an appe-
tite for the next meal. /
Of people who travel nine out of ten
use Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets, know-
ing them to be perfectly safe to use at
any time and also having found out by
experience that they are a safeguard
against indigestion in any form, and
eating, as they have to. at all hours
and all kinds of food, the traveling
public for years have pinned their faith
to Stuart's Tablets.
All druggists sell them at 50 cents for

from Maine to California, if his opinion

pepsia Tablets is the most popular and
successful remedy for ' any stomach

charge of grapeshot which might have
wiped out the whole Romanoff dynasty 1
â Czar, Czarina, Grand Dukes and all.
In the shower of bullets his Majesty
displayed the greatest sangfroid.
The head of the Greek church ob
tained the coins from Bernhard Tut
nauer, a Jew, who lives at Radautz, a
t.A\n in the Austrian crownland Buko
vina. Three years ago a wonder-work- .
ing rabbi from the Orient was Tut
nauer's guest. Departing, the rabbi re
warded the hospitality shown him with
the coins, saying:
"My son, although these pieces may
seem a poor gift, they will protect those
far greater than you in time of dan
ger."
Lately, for three nights in succession, '
the vision of Alexander 111, the Czar's
laih'-r. appeared to Tutnauer and told
him the rabbi's coins would shield any
one w - ho wears a crown from a violent
death. Tutnauer sent the coins to the
Russian Charge d'Affaires at Vienna,
with a message which vividly described
his triple dream.
Much impressed, the Charge forward
ed the coins to his Majesty, who, most
gratefully, acknowledged their receipt.
The few faithful who surround him re
joioe that the coins have lent him con
fidence. They do not seek to disabuse
him of his belief in their protecting
power.
Before the Czar put the coins in his
pocket they had been tested at the
Imperial Laboratory for any insidious
poison that might lurk in thent.
So the superstition which enthrals
the Czar as completely as the lowliest
of his moujik6 has manifested itself
aerain. Now he is reconciled to the loss
of Zenobia Golaczy. the beautiful little
woman from Poltava, the charming
mystic who conjured pictures for him
on a screen. The dreamy prophetess
Interpreted the meaning of the dull,
confused, waving masses of light she
summoned to please herself and her
imperial patron. Her seances gave
him hope; she showed him the shad
owy Japanese fleeing before dazzling
Cossacks.
Unluckily for herself, the Golaczy
was not content to deal alone with the
Czar's fears and hopes. She promised
to tell him what the Grand Dukes
were plotting, what his Ministers were
planning. She disappearedâ no one
knows whither.
Ttie Japanese and the Greeks.
while they (the Russians) are good
hearted and high spirited m the main,
they are a great deal too fond of in
dulging in various frivolities instead of
attending to business and, further, they
are apt to let private affairs come be
fore their duty. In this there is the
strongest possible contrast between the
Japanese and the Russian and It ex
plains a good deal. In fact, the Japan
ese can teach all Western nations a
great lesson in earnestness and another
lesson in duty. Our maxim that "AH j
work and no play will make Jack a 'â¢
dull boy" seems to be totally disproved,
for with the Japanese diversions oc
cupy scarcely a hundredth part of the
attention we give them. They cannot
understand how we devote so much
time to amusements. They live more
nearly on the plan of the Spartan than
any Western nation. The noblest and
richest in Japan cultivate an elegant
simplicity and an Intellectual intensity
worthy of the school of Socrate6. Not
all of them, of course, possibly not even
a majority, but certamly a far larger
proportion than in Europe. And taking
the nation as a whole, I think the
ideals, the ambition?, the philosophy,
the domestic life, and the weakness,
defects and downright vices of the an
cient Greeks at their best are more
nearly reproduced in the Japanese than
in any other people. â Thomas Corwin
in "Russo-Japanese War."
Figures published by the Tea Bro
kers' Association of London, for the
five months ending October 31, last
year, show a dimunition in the con
sumption of tea in the British isles to
the extent of 4,000,000 pounds as com
pared with the correr .>onding time in
1903, an indication of dire poverty.

WILL IX TIME BE
THE WORLD CAPITAL
New York City Fast Becoming the
Financial and Commercial
Center.
It takes ages to change, the commer
cial and financial center of the world.
When one is once established it shifts
tardily and only long after it has ceased
to be the most convenient place for the
greatest number of people. There have
been but a comparatively few such cen
ters in the history of commerce.. For
centuries their location waa on the
Mediterranean Sea or itÃ tributaries.
Carthage, Rome, Constantinople, Vien
na followed one another at long inter
vals. With the growth of the Anglo-
Saxon and Germanic races and the de
velopment of ocean traffio the location
shifted to northern Europe. Then came
Bruges, Antwerp, Amsterdam and
finally London, where it still remains.
But the signs of the times now point
to another change. The United States
holds one-fourth of the world's" stock
of gold and controls over one-third of
the world's banking power. In round
figures the world's supply of gold is
$2,500,200,000. Of this the United States
holds $1,320,400,000. The world's bank
ing power is approximately $33,608,000,
000. Of this $13,826,000,000 belongs to
the United States. During the last dec
ade the United States has gained 108.47
per cent in this particular to the 82.57
per cent gain of all combined foreign
nations.
If this rate continues, and it seems
that it will, then London must even
tually yield her supremacy to some
city in the United States. New York
will, of course, be that city, owing to
Its marvelous advantages, due to its
access to the lakes through the Erie
canal to the convergence there of most
of the transcontinental railroads and
to its superior situation as a port for
European trade. â Kansas City Journal.
Need to Change Names.
The Danish Government has found
it necessary to grant the privilege to
the heads of families in changing their
names, if they feel so disposed. It is
a necessary piece of legislation for the
Danes, it seems, as the entire popula
tion is divided into three great clans â
the Hansena. the Petersens and the
Scerensens. Beside any one of
these familiar Smiths and Joneses of
Anglo-Saxon origin would be in an
absurd minority. In one town of
25,000 inhabitants there are only about
twenty surnames to go round and the
trouble experienced by the poÃtman
almost drives him to drink. Conse
quently this granting of a new name
privilege will be a matter of rejoicing
in the Danish postoffice, if nowhere
else. â Boston Herald.
Six Infants in One Year.
The Munich Neueste Nachrichten
arnounces that Frau Higen of Trost
btrg, in Bavaria, has borne no less
than six children in one year. She
was delivered of triplets last January
and bore triplets again this December.
The case is attracting much attention
from the medical profession. â London
Standard.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SIXDAY, FEBRUARY 19, 1905.
OFFERS HINTS
TO THE BOARD
Adorn ment Association Is
in Favor of Permanent
Improvements on Streets
A communication has been ad
dressed by the Association for the Im
provement and Adornment of San
Francisco to the Board of Supervisors
concerning the use of the proceeds
from the sale of street improvement
bonds for permanent street work. The
communication is as follows:
"In the matter of the issuance of
bonds for street improvements, per
mit the Adornment Association to call
your attention to the desirability of
using: the proceeds of bonds for per
manent street work, because repairs
are properly chargeable to current
revenue. ]
"There is, we respectfully submit, a
great necessity for the improvement
of Market street from the ferry to
.Second street. Lower Market street
and streets leading to it are below the
grade on account of a gradual sub
sidence (due to the fact that below
Battery street it is made land), which
the seawalJ is expected to check. Mr.
Grunsky. in the report of the Board
of Public Works, 1901-03, page ISO, ,
gives a table showing such subsidence.
The streets should now be filled up to
the grade, the till resting on a suitable
foundation, such as is used in the con
struction of buildings in that district.
Private owners have already built to
grade in many instances, thus making
the sidewalks irregular.
"In the plans and estimates of the
City Engineer (page 78 of the pro
ceedings of the Board of Supervisors
in the matter of the issuance of bonds,
1903-04), this provision is found:
'Where, as in the case of the easterly
end of Market street and the streets
terminating in this section of Market
street, there has been considerable
sinking below official street grade, it
Is proposed to raise the streets to their !
proper position and to put all new
work at official grade.'
"A committee of this association
has waited on the Street Committee
of the Board of Supervisors and on
the Board of Public Works and, after i
a careful study of traffic conditions, â¢
has recommended a basalt block
pavement similar to that on Third '
street, properly grouted with liquid
asphalt on a deep concrete founda- j
tion as the most satisfactory pave- '
ment for the entire surface of Mar
ket street from East to Valencia, It
was suggested that the blocks be laid
on oblique lines in order that ve
hicles may meet less resistance, thus
saving the surface, making travel
more comfortable and causing less J
noise.
"The committee of our association, i
consisting of Herbert E. Law and
Thomas Magee, has also laid before
your honorable body, with its tacit
approval, the desirability of sewering,
widening and paving Mission street, !
which Kas the indorsement of this as
sociatioft. I desire to say that the
committee has been instrumental in :
inducing local financial institutions to
bid on the bonds offered by the city j
February 20 next with these Im
provements in view and report that
they have received assurances from
financial Institutions, which justify
them in saying that the following
bonds offered for sale February 20 j
will be paid for as follows: Forhos
pital, $250,000; for sewers, $281,200:
for streets, $243,000; for county jail
addition to Hall of Justice, $278,400; I
for school bonds, $359,200, making a ,
total of $1,411,800."
TO ACCEPT PROPERTY.â City Attorney j
Long yesterday notified the Board of Super- \
vlsora that all the proceedings relative to the
conveyance of two blocks of land for Mia
alon Park by two Jewish societies to the city '
have been completed. Long recommends that
the conveyances be accepted and that pro
vision be made to pay $281,350 to the gran-
Uea.
BAEHR REPLIES
TO THE MAYOR
Says He Will Continue to
Audit Demands for the Ex
penses of the Grand Jury
BACKED BY A DECISION
Notifies Schmitz He Will
Be Eesponsible for Un
itemized Bills if Illegal
Auditor Baehr yesterday forwarded a
reply to the communication of Mayor
Schmitz calling upon him to make good
the moneys paid out on demands for
Grand Jury expenses and to cease
auditing similar demands in the future.
Baehr gives a Supreme Court decision
in the case of Jurors' fees as his au
thority for auditing the demands in
excess of the specific appropriation for
Grand Jury expenses and flatly in
forms the Mayor that he will continue
to audit such demands until stopped
by higher authority. Baehr's letter
follows :
"San Francisco, February 18, 1905.
"Hon. E. E. Sehmit*, Mayor, San
Francisco, Cal.
"Dear Sir: Your communication of j
the 14th inst. received and its contents
duly noted. I am aware that the char- J
ter prohibits ' me from approving de- j
mauds, except upoft an unexhausted
specific appropriation. But the Su
preme Court in the case of jurors' fees
I compelled me to disregard that provi-
I sion of the charter, and I think the !
! principle is the same as to Grand Jury
I expenses. At least 1 shall so regard it
j until it has been otherwise decided by
j equally strc-ng authority.
"Your suggestions regarding unitem
ized bills are true in a general way.
But the case under consideration is an j
ex< . ptiohal one. If the bills were sent !
to me in the first Instance, I should de- j
mand the items. But the Grand Jury
is a secret body under direction of the
presiding Judge. It is necessary for
the public good that their investiga- I
tions be kept secret. If he is satisfied ;
to order payment of certain items [
which are suppressed publication tern- 1
j porarily I am not disposed to put my- I
self in contempt by overruling his or- j
der. If it eventually appears that he ;
has approved bills for 'champagne
quaffed in various houses of ill fame' ',
he will have to answer to the public I
for his actions, and I will be respon- i
sible for the return of the money so |
used to the city. The city shall lose !
I nothing through mo which it is not i
j strictly bound to pay. In the mean- i
time 'l shall continue to recognize or- i
ders of Judge Lawlor fur legitimate
Grand Jury expenses until stopped by
higher authority. Yours truly,
â¢HARRY BAEHR, Auditor."
The Mayor had left his office when
Baehr's letter was delivered and any
action that he may contemplate in the
premises will of necessity be postponed
until to-morrow.

STEFFENS GETS
THREE YEARS
Strong Plea Is Made for
Mercy Toward the Con
victed Ballot-Box Stuffer
MURDERER SENTENCED
George Curry, Who Killed
His Spouse, Keceiyes the
Limit for Manslaughter
Four prisoners received their sen
tences yesterday, one in Judge Law
lor's court and three in Judge Dunne's
court. Adolph Steffens, the ballot box
stuffer, was sentenced by Judge Law
lor to serve three years in San Quen
tin. Motions for a new trial and ar
rest of judgment were denied. There
upon Attorney O'Grady made a plea
for lenity. He said the defendant was
the principal support of his aged moth
er, five unmarried sisters, one of them
a cripple, and a young brother. What
ever punishment was imposed upon
the defendant the family would be the
chief sufferers. The Judge in passing
sentence said that several witnesses
during the" trial had testified to the de
fendant's good reputation and the court
would take that into consideration. The
defendant's attorney was allowed till
February 28 to prepare bills of excep
tions for an appeal to the Supreme
Court.
George Curry, who was tried for
murder before a jury in Judge Dunne's
court and convicted of manslaughter,
was sentenced to ten years in San
Quentin. He shot and killed his wife,
Daisy, at 35 Turk street on July 5 be
cause she had left him and refused to
return. They had only been married
a few weeks. When the jury brought
in the verdict of manslaughter the
Judge expressed his surprise and sug
gested that the District Attorney
should make an investigation of the
conduct of Chief Jailer Sullivan of the
County Jail and one of his deputies for
testifying at the trial that Curry had
been seized with a fit in his cell at the
jail.
Luigi Degracia, convicted of grand
larceny, was sentenced by Judge Dunne
to five years in San Quentin. He swin
dled V. Giovannoni on December 17
out of $485 by representing that he was
the owner of vegetable gardens.
Lorenzo Andino, charged with assault
with a deadly weapon but allowed to
plead guilty to simple assault, was
sentenced by Judge Dunne to serve
thirty days in the County Jail. He
stabbed Teofilo Bustamante with a
knife in his room on Pinckney alley on
November 14.

WOMAN'S DEATH
IS MYSTERIOUS
Mrs. Hannah McSweeney May
Be Victim of an Unknown
Assailant Bent on Murder
VIOLENT BLOW STBITK
Dr. Bacigalupi Inclined to
Believe That Old Woman
Died of Unnatural Cause
Aji autopsy on the body of aged Mrs.
Hannah McSweeney yesterday indi
cates that the old woman was the vic
tim of a brutal murderer. The Morgue
surgeon. Dr. Bacigalupi, declares that
her death wm due to hemorrhage of
the brain, caused by a violent blow
Irom a blunt instrument.
The body was found on Friday on
the floor of a squalid tenement at 221
i-ignth street, where Mrs. McSweeney
nad been living for several years. Mrs.
J. Simme, a neighbor, entered the place
â with some food for the old woman and ;
round her stretched on the floor life
less. No visible marks of violence were
found on the body, and Deputy Cor
oner Meehan attributed the death to
heart failure. Yesterday afternoon Dr.
bacigalupi discovered that Mrs. Mc
fcweeney had probably been murdered.
The old woman wae la6t seen alive
on Thursday night as she entered her
rooms. Though the neighborhood Is
thickly populated, no one else was seen
to entÂ«r the place or leave it. No
weapon of any eort was found near the
body.
While It is ehown that Mrs. Mc-
Bweeney came to her death through
violence, the police are at a loss to find
any motive for the crime. The old
woman had been living in poverty for
years. The theory is advanced that
ehe, being very feeble, fell to the floor
and received the injuries that caused
HT death. Detective Bailey is work-
Ing en the case.

WOMAN ADRIFT IN DISABLED AIRSHIP
USES HAIRPIN TO PUNCTURE GAS BAG
Mrs. George E. Heaton Has an
Adventure in Clouds.
"WRfccK Of THE AIRSHIP CALIFORNIA MESSENGER, WHICH YESTERDAY MADE A PERILOUS TRIP OVER BFIKE! ET
AND OAKLAND. AND INVENTOR GEORGE E. HEATON AND HIS PLUCKY WIFE. THE PHOTOGRAPH W\S TAKEN
IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE MACHINE DESCENDED WITH MRS. HEATON. rÂ«uiui,KAfÂ« \% Ab TAKEN
I- .
BERKELEY, Feb. 18. â Woman
achieved a distinct victory in ariel
navigation over Berkeley this after
noon and although she finally yielded
to the ancient law that "That which
goes up must come down," she man
aged to make her descent as com
fortable as possible under the circum
stances and escape unhurt.
A good, strong set of teeth and a
hairpin saved the day. They were the
adjuncts of a steady nerve and a
knowledge of gas balloons. Mrs.
George E. Heaton used the combina
tion to an advantage while soaring
aloft in her husband's airship, the
California Messenger, after the ship
had escaped from its moorings with
the brave little lady 'at the motor
helm. For one hour the airship
circled above Berkeley, drifting bay
ward, then landward, finally poising
in its erratic flight above the sharp
spires of the college town that threat
ened to impale it. and end its useful-
I ness should it come tumbling from its
! high estate and flutter helplessly near
terr.i fir ma.
Mrs. Heaton tore a hole in the
great gas bag with her teeth and whilp
] the silken airship was wafted about
' from compass point to compass point
i she struggled desperately with her
( hands to enlarge the opening that the
i gas? might be released and the air
j ship brought to earth. This was when
the hairpin came in handy. There is
an innsr lining of strongly woven ma
terial in the balloon and through this
tough substance the hairpin was used
to poke a tiny hole. Gradually this
J was enlarged and the balloon com-
I menced to settle.
j SPECTATORS WATCH FLIGHT.
(Several times the thousands of
gaping spectators that watched the
fight for life Mrs. Heaton vai mak-
J ing in the air above them expected to
â¢ spp the airship turn a complete somer
, sault. Back and forth the car lurched
j and swayed, but Mrs. Heaton was s.blÂ«
. to maintain her position by clinging
, to the rigging of the balloon.
The airship landed in a vacant lot
!at Dwight way and Grant street. A
crowd of several thousand persons had
gathered there, having watched the
progress of the shin, intent upon get
ting a glimpse of the aeronaut, uncer
tain whether life or death would be
found to have triumphed as a result
of her adventure in the clouds.
Mrs. Heaton emerged from the tan
gled mass of wires, ropes and ma
chinery unhurt, but shivering and
white of face. Her husband had
watched the flight of the ship through
a telescope and came to her aid. The
airship. was not badly damaged. The
story of the woman's struggle in mid
SAN FRANCISCO, SUNDAY, FEBRUARY 19, 1905,
air with the derelict 'airship is best
told in her own words. She said:
"I must say that I was not as fright
ened when the airship broke from its
moorings as one would suppose. I
have had some experience with bal
loons and my first thought was that
th t ascent would be nothing more nor
less than a balloon voyage. I therefore
made up my mind to keep cool and try
; to steer the shi;> with the rudder, that
I had discovered to be in good work
i ing: order, although the engines were
toe complicated for me to attempt to
use them.
'When I realized that the ship was
adrift I looked ovft the edge of the
basket and saw my husband and a
! number of men running about on the
i ground and every now and then raising
| their hands to their mouths as if try
ing to shout something to me. I heard
a few unintelligible sounds, but as the
balloon rose higher these soon died out
I completely and all was silent as the
grave. The earth fell fast below me
and objects upon it soon became mere
dots.
MOTOR RUNS SLOWLY.
"When the ship broke away the
motor was running slowly, but it was
getting feeble every minute, as it had
been set to run only a short while. I
thought that when the engine stopped
running it would be difficult for me
to steer, as the current from the en
gine operates the guide ropes that con
nect with the rudder. However, the
helm responded more or less to my ef
f< rts to control it and I commenced to
feel more secure until I found myself
confronted with a new danger that is
always a terror to aeronauts.
"The gas in the balloon commenced
to expand as the ship reached the high
altitudes and I knew that there was
danger of it bursting. The tension
was great and the glossy sides of the
big bag strained dangerously as the
tremendous interior pressure in
creased.. T climbed into the rope sup
ports of the car and tried to reach the
cord that is attached to the gas valve,
or release vent, but tug as hard as I
could at it the valve refused io work.
"Higher and higher soared the bal
loon and I knew that something des
ptrate would have to be done or I was
doomed to drop 2000 feet to my death.
"I hadn't a knife, nor was there any
thing in the car with which I could
.puncture the bag. I climbed up high
enough in the car to grasp the silk
tube through n-hich the gas is forced
into the balloon, and, holding on with
one hand, I caught the tube in the
other and went to work on it with my
teeth. With difficulty I tore a small
hole in the outer covering, into which
I inserted my fingers and enlarged the
opening. This exposed the tougher
inner skin,' that refused to yield so
easily to my teeth. Then I thought uf
a hairpin, and with a dint of patience
and drilling I made a tiny hole in the
cover, and was rewarded for my ef
forts by hearing the hiss of escaping
gas through the- small aperture.
PRESSURE IS RELIEVED.
"The insignificant amount of gas
that was escaping did not affect The
buoyancy of tho balloon very much
I worked the hairpin around in the
puncture and Enlarged the hole some.
The pressure of ras aided me. and soon
there was quite a rush of the vapor
and a noticeabie shi inking of the taut
Â«i lk '-over.
"Slowly the airship settled toward
the earth. I took hold of the steering
gear and was delighted to find that
the ship answered the helm -beautiful
ly. It moved forward and downward
toward Berkeley, and 1 chose a wide
green space to which to steer and had
no difficulty directing the airship to
ward it. As 1 neared the ground I
braced myself against the sides of the
basket and prepared for the jar to
come. But it did not come. ' The car
touched the ground gently and there
were scores of Dersons there to hold it
while I alighted. My husband was soon
on the spot, having followed the course
of the .airship from the' time it broke
away until it landed.
"I do not feel in any way unnerved by
my experience, and am certain that
my husband will soon perfect his air
ship so that it will be as manageable
and as safe as any ever invented. If
a woman can control ft the way I did
without the engine running, what
should not an experienced man op
erator be able to do with the vessel?"

REAL SORT OF "MIKADO"

for Benefit of Eed Cross
SALLY SHARP
Not being on 1 speaking terms , with
the Japanese r tongue nor Japanese
stagecraft,- the programme at the Al
hambra last night for : the benefit of
the Japanese Red Cross Society rather
| stumped me and | there evidently were
others. But that the dances arid, the
dramatic work, all pantomime were
interesting is r agreed, .if you had the
| patience to sit.it out, ,an achievement
attained by about a sixth of the house.
; The programme opened with a
weird dance, "Matzukaze," .by Miss
Saku - Ogawa, portraying â¢ a pretty
peasant girl wandering: in search of
her lover, Prince Yukihira.
The music .accompanying this and
some of the other dances was wrought
from the I same' type drum as is used
by the Chinese and the Indians â in j
fact, all the music: heard last night is
identical in many phases with ~ the j
music of the Chinese and the Indian. ]
And in this suggestion, as well as in
theme of the drama . presented (in
part) lay the true interest 1 of the per
formance, . for it suggested many
things -to him who is interested .in ; the
development of man. ' '
-; , But, ye ; gods, there comes ..a. . time
when even that interest lags, when for
twenty minutes a dramatic ', dance ' is
kept awhirl, to the monotone of drums
and the twang of fiddlesâ "kotos" they
call them. To be sure, the, dance tells
a story, but it's an a\fful long storyâ
for us nervous, hurried Americans.
And, by \ the way, a Japanese at my
right, " Americanized, to . be sure, ' de
clared the numbers too slow for him,
now that he has learned to '.know, the
American plays and turns. . :} .â¢ .',.
" The Jiu-jitsu was one of the most ap
preciated numbers i offered, because we
understood ;it.\'. And it was extremely
clever. One musical number was en
tertainingâthe \ \ duet with j koto . and
luye. bringing out ; the - rhythm so well
known in the types of music mentioned
above. But in my wildest moments 1
could not profess to en Joy it. ftpi-i

Because she would not leave the

switchmen's ball with him, Edward
Pratt shot his landlady, Mrs. Alice
Keig, and killed himself last night at
439 Jessie street. The bullet fired at
the woman 'entered her neck, grazing
her spinal column and paralyzing all
her limbs. The wound will probably
prove fatal.
Pratt had been paying ardent court
ship to Mrs. Keig lor four years. He
was of a jealous disposition and sev
eral . times threatened to . "fix" her.
The woman had been advised to have
him bound over to keep the peace, but
refused" to do so.
Last night Pratt met Mrs. Keig in
the hallway of the Jessie-street place,
which . she ha.3 been running as a
rooming-house. "Are you ready to
go to tne ball; with me to-night?" he
asked. . .; . â  ,
Mrs. Keig told him she could not
' go because her . son Louis was iii and
needed her care. Pratt began to curse
loudly.
"You're going to throw me down,
are you ?" he shouted, and his hand
new to his hip pocket.
"I am not going to throw you down."
said Mrs. Keig. preserving her calm
ness though she was terrified by the
expression on the man's face. " T ""-~-Â«::.
"You are going to throw me down, '
he insisted;' "I'll fix. you." - Before she
knew it ! Pratt held a revolver .in each
hand. He fired and she reeled back

"Now, I'll get that son of yours, too,"
he ; muttered â * and " rushed .i upstairs to
where young Louis K&ig lay ill in bed.
The young man heard. the snot and the

it was found that - she had lost . the
use of her limbs from the effects' . of
the 'shot. â The bullet -.entered the jaw
on the left side and came out at the '
back â of the â  neck. â *â  The surgeons fear'
that the wound will result in the, wom
an's death. ,
Mrs. Keig is 38 years of age and a
widow. Her assailant, Pratt, was a bar
tender, employed at 660 Fourth street.
He was 'formerly a railroad* man. Pratt
had been rooming in Mrs. Keig's house
ever since she started the place at 439
Jessie street and had been very atten
tive to her. He was about 40 years old.
Policeman Heinz, who arrived at the
scene shortly after the shooting, says
he had been informed that Prutt had
threatened to kill Mrs.; Keig. He did
not take any steps in the matter be
cause Mrs. ' Keig refused to make a
charge against the man.
- Mrs. Annie Roberts, a roomer, rush
ed to Mrs. Keig's - side shortly alter
she was shot and was trying to
stanch the ; blood that gushed from
the wound when Pratt returned and
turned the second pistol on himself.
Mrs. Â« -Keig retained . consciousness
throughout it all.. At the Central
Emergency Hospital she talked freely
of the affair.
"I have known Pratt for four years,"
she said. "I. went out with him a
great deal. Last night he wanted me
to go to the switchmen's balL I told
him that I could 4 not leave my hick
son He became furious. I tried to
soothe him bus he only got angrier."
â  Up to a late hour the woman was
resting easily, .but little hope is ex
pressed for her recovery. Pratt's body
was taken] to the Morgue.

MILLER TROPHY
FOR MISS HESS
Fair Tennis Player Easily
Defeats Miss Saylor on
Golden Gate Park Courts
BOYS IN COMPETITION
Wield Their Rackets Until
Xight Settles Down and
Prevents a Continuation
The tennis courts dried rapidly yes
terday and the players who were un
able to play during the week turned
out in numbers. Many of the crack
players of the Golden Gate Club crossed |
the bay to play in the Alameda County I
championship tournament, but the park
courts were by no means deserted. The
members of the Traders' Annex played
a handicap singles tournament for
third class players. The boy's handi
cap singles tournament, which was
commenced a week 'ago, was also in
progress.
Miss E. Hess carried off the honors
in the ladies' event. She played on the [
"15" mark and beat Miss G. Saylor
easily In the finals. The loser had a
handicap of "3-6" in this match, but
won only three games in two sets.
Only six ladies entered the tourna
ment and one defaulted. The prelim
inary round match between Miss B.
Cully (scratch) and Miss A. Greenberg
(15) resulted in a victory for the form
er, the score being 6-1, 7-5. In the
semi-nnals Miss G. Saylor (15 3-6)
beat Miss J2. Noble (15 3-6), 6-1, 6-4,
and Miss E. Hess (la) beat Miss B.
Cully (scratch), 7-5, 6-1. In the finals
Miss Hess beat Miss Saylor 6-1, 6-2.,
The w inner will hold the Miller cup un
til thi next tournament is played.
The boys played until it was too dark
to see, but were unable to finish their
tournament. Miles McLaughlin (owe
30) and Richard Strachan (owe 15)
reached the finals. When the match
was called each had won a set and the
score stood 4-4 on the third and de
ciding set. The match will be finished
Monday afternoon.
McLoughlin is the most heavily
handicapped player in the tournament,
but worked his way to the finals with
the loss of but a single set. Strachan
who was also called upon to give large
handicaps, did not lose a set until he
met McLoughlin in the finals. He is
imp of the smallest players in the city,
bin wields his racket cleverly. Mc-
Loughlin is the best player for his age
at the park and has an easy, graceful
style. His game is similar in many
ways to that of Champion MacGavin.
An unusually large number of play
ers were present at the California Club
courts and Borne spirited matches were
played. George Janes and Herbert
Long figured in the best two matches
of the day. They won both, but in each
they had their hands full.
The first match was between Her
bert Schmidt and Harry Rolfe and
Long and Janes. The former won the
first easily, the score being 6-1.
The next two sets brought out a pretty
struggle. At no time did either team
have much of a lead. Both sets were
won by Long and James by an 8-tf
score.
[>ong and Janes next took on Joseph
Tobtfl and Will Taylor, two champions
of former days. The veterans were by
no means outclassed and Long and
Janes soon found out their best efforts
were required for them to win. The
first set Was nip and tuck, with first
one team in the lead and then the
other. Finally the youngsters won by
a score of 11-9. Tobin and Taylor had
a big lead in the second set, but lying
and Janr-s put up a strong finish and
won 6-4. Taylor did some excellent
lobbing and some of his returns on the
back court surprised his opponents.
Tobin drove and smashed well, but his
volleying was rather uncertain.
The scores of the boy's handicap sin
rlpp tournament follow: â
Third roundâ R. Reegel (151-6) heat
H. McLane (owe 3-6), 7-9. 6-0, 7-5; M.
McLoughlin (owe 30) beat V. Butler
(â cratch) by default; If. Morris (3-6)
K. Garcia <i 5"-6). 1-6. 7-5, m-s.
Fourth roundâ Manndrell (15 1-6)
beat Maggs (5-6). 6-1, 6-0: R. Strachan
(owe 15) beat Marcus (1-6). 6-4, 6-4;
Long (owe 4-6) beat Reegel (15 1-6), 11
?. 6-3; McLoughlin (owe 30) beat Morris
(3-6). 6-3, 8-6.
Semi finalsâ Ptrachan beat Manndrell
6-1. 6-2; McLoughlin beat Long 6-4,

I ber of the varsity track team, who
I v as to run in the Columbia-Cornell re-

St&ngland # is stated to be suffering
from an enlargement of the heart. Al

easily outfought and outgeneraled
Clifford. The event was under the
auspices of the Phoenix Athletic Club

Clifford. Mark Shaughnessy refereed

general approval.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, FEBRUARY 19, 1905.
FRANGIBLE, BACKED AT LONG ODDS,
IS IN FRONT FROM START TO FINISH
Agnes Mack Defeated by the Outsider Silicate, While
I'm Joe Captmres Two- Year-Old Dash.
Hainault the Only
Winning First
Choice
FRED E. MULHOLLAND
The card at Oakland yesterday, whll*
devoid of any special feature, attracted
the usual Saturday gathering. A heavy
track lent additional hazard to the
game, and but one favorite secured a
purse. Frangible, backed down from
25 to 9, -furnished the sensation.
Charley I'atterson's filly Busy "Bee
went to the post favorite at 3 to 5 for
the <wo-year-old scramble. Alarie, who
had the mount, got away poorly and
the ftlly ran third. I'm Joe, with
Wright up, showed in front, winning
easily at the wire from Novi, a 75 to 1
shot.
Tony Barren's mare Silicate, a neg
lectea If. to 1 shot, captured the five
furlong selling dash. Agnes Mack, the
favorite, looked a certainty, but "Big
Bill" Knapp, on the outsider, picked a
better route through the stretch than
Blake, scoring without great effort. Re
dan ran third und should have won.
JOCKEY KNAPP IN FORM.
Again in the six-furlong selling num
ber, which followed, was the superior
jockeyship of Knapp apparent. "Big
Bill" had the leg up on Revolt, the sec
ond choice, and, picking the choicest
going, led the favorite, Hulford, over
the line a neck. .The show was taken
by Fitzpatrick on Cloche d'Or.
Wrigfat annexed the sculling cham
pionship with Frangible, a 25 to 1 shot,
in the mile and a sixteenth regatta.
The water was calm and placid, with
just a noticeable ripple. Flying Tor
pedo, the cynosure of all eyes, the pub
lic idol, trained to the minute, had first
call in the betting. The bookies
shouted themselves hoarse giving
away the 7 to 5, done in antique fres
co work Â«>n the slates. Next in de
mand came Scherzo, son of the mighty
Crescendo. From 8 to 5 confederate
and stage money backed his price to
2^ to . 1. Then entered into the bet
ting realm the loner, tall, lanky, short,
thick-set man with smooth face and
whiskers, wearing the mysterious
white hat and Satanic smile. He ob
served the 20 and 25 to 1 about Frangi
ble. Putting down the hat lower over
his eyes, then folding up the sinister
smile and placing it in a grip which he
carried, the onslaught commenced.
FRANGIBLE WINS HANDILY.
Frangible closed at 9. There was
nothing to the race but Frangible.
Cockswain Wright turned the stake
boat first and paddled In four open
boat lengths before Otis with Scherzo.
Barrett, on Flying Torpedo, had trouble
with his motor, managing to alight
safely In the Ftmw. â âº
Anvil is a good horse if one can
guess him. and that is where the joker
lies. He started in a race last Tues
day when every well-informed person
on the track played Best Man and
finished fourth. In the seven fur
long recital yesterday, Bab caught the
popular fancy, her opening quotation
of 8 to 5 giving way to even money.
"Big Bill" Knapp managed to get the
mare cut off at the start, and paste
boards bearing her name are now
cherished relics in many a cheerless
home. Grover Cleveland Fuller Wright
went out in front with Anvil and
at wire time, beat Mountebank eight
wide open lengths. Haven Run ran
third.
Finally a favorite won. In the mile
and seventy-yard selling fixture, Hain
ault was plunged on at 8 to 5. The
brown gelding raced Platt to a stand
still, and was later brought to a hard
drive by Otis on old Barrack, winning
out -by a length. Platt took show
honors.
TRACK NOTES.
The temperature of I'm Joe was re
ported to be 116 by the restaurant,
thermometer .and his backers were
badly scared. For a sick horse he did
exceedingly well.
Busy Bee is as speckled as Bob Fitz
simmons with blotches caused by
some blood disorder.
Horses appear to display plenty of
speed for Wright, Charley Murray's
apprentice, who passed the wire on
three winners. His services are in big
demand.
"Big Bill" Knapp reached the wire
lir*-:t 011 two occasions.
Dr. Leggro. winner of the Ascot
Derby at Los Angeles, was bred at A.
B. Sprockets' Napa BtOCk farm. He is
a son of Puryear D and Sevens and
was purchased as a yearling by C. C.
McCafferty for $1200.
Oxford, the gray wonder, which ran
third in the Derby, was rated a $10,
000 colt. How much Is Dr. Leggo
worth now?
Hainault has won eight races since
December 30 last.

NEW YORK BOWLERS WANT
TO- GOVERN THEMSELVES
Decide to Ask for Home Rule at the
National Bowling Champion
ship Meeting.
CHICAGO, Feb. 18.â Coolan, Dumas
and Riddell, New Yorkers, wore in
Chicago to-day, en route to the na
tional bowling championship tourna
ment, which opened i.t Milwaukee to
night.
"We are bearers of resolutions adopt
ed by the New York Bowling Associa
tion," said one of the Gothamites at
the Auditorium this evening. "What
we want in to be allowed home rule, as
we have what we consider an ideal or
ganization in Gotham. Then, too, we
want the weight of bowling balls lim
it ed to sixteen pounds. We would pre
fer having an all-wood ball, for we
think it gives the stronger man an
advantage over the weaker when the
ball is loaded to the limit with lead.
At home we use square gutters, while
cut here you prefer rounded ones. The
square gutter eliminates to a certain
extent the luck of the game and puts
the sport on a more scientific basis.
"If we are granted these concessions
by the American Bowling Congress we
are willing to join and put our shoul
ders to the wheel. We are not out
after the next meet and are willing to
go half way to bury the hatchet."
FORECASTS THE ATTENDANCE
AT LEWIS AND CLARK FAIR
Expert Figures on 1,370,000 and
Suggests Xew Ways of In
creasing Crowd.
The Lewis and Clark Fair boomers
are at work grinding out statistics of
probable attendance at Portland next
year. The secretary of the company
has now got his figures up to 1,Â«
370,000, and other enthusiasts have
gone as high as 2,000,000. One
method that has been suggested to
draw visitors from Oregon and Wash
ington la to establish a camping
ground where farmers and their fam
ilies may pitch their tents and do the
fair without paying tribute to the
hotels. The attendance expert is in
teresting when he "gets down to fig
ures." He says: "Let us take into ac
count that the country tributary to
I Portland may be conservatively esti
mated as having 400,000 people with
in an area of 100 miles; within 200
miles are 800,000; within 300 miles,
1,200,000; within 500 miles, 1,800,000;
within 1000 miles, 5,000,000. While
these figures look big to people living
on the coast, when compared to the
30,000,000 Inhabitants living within
500 miles of St. Louis, they are small.
The 1000-mile line out of Portland
swings one-third of the distance to
New York on the> east, into Mexico
on the south, well iAto Alaska on the
north, and on the west far out into
the Pacific Ocean. No other exposi
tion ever held, with the exception of
the San Francisco Midwinter Pair of
1894, has had so small a population
to draw upon for admissions. The
paid admissions at San Francisco,
which were 1,315,022, serve as a fair
index of what Portland may expect
next year. It is quite likely that
Portland's attendance will be found
to average about 10,000 per day or a
total of 1,370,000 for the period of the
exposition." This publicity expert is
modest and deserves honor as a
prophet. â New York Globe.
Arrogance of Gotham Waiters
A Chicago man just returned from
a visit to New York declares that
nothing can exaggerate the exorbitant
prices charged by fashionable restau
rants there and that the haughty
waiters in such places gave him cold
chills. ' Accompanied by another
Chicago man," he says, "I went into
one of these dens of thieves and call
ing a distinguished looking person in
evening dress, asked him if he wa*
the waiter. With rather a bored aii
he answered that he was the waiter's
valet, but that he would call the wait
er. He did so. A still more distin
guished individual approached and
said: 'What can I do you for, sir
I mean what can I do for you?" Oh
yes," in response to mild protest*
"that may be a little bit overdrawn'
but not much."

farm, ran well up until the stretch
where he moved up like a flash and
won by four lengths eased up. The
time, 2:03% for the Brooks' course

ter of the card attracted a crowd of
seven thousand people. Favorites were

NELSON STARTS
TO SHED FLESH
Weight Which Gives the
Boxer's Trainers Some
Worry Begins to Yield
CORBETT DOING NICELY
Joe Gaiis' .Work With Him
on the Road and With thÂ«>
Olores of Great Berlin
The problem of Battling Nelson mak
ing 130 pounds, which has bothered his
trainers for the last few days, took a
brighter turn yesterday, when the Dan
mounted the scales after a hear
luncheon and tipped the beam 1
pounds.
The Battler's system has at last
yielded to the strenuous method
reducing which his trainers
adopted, and from now on it k
pected the proposition of maklr
required weight will be easy sailing.
It was feared that Bat coul'.
readily make the weight, but the
ety has now been thrown to the wteis.
Manager Billy Nolan asserts, ho
that this is the last occasion h
permit his protege to fight at 1 ; .
pounds.
Bat Is inclined to grow heavy, Â«o no
chance of losing a forfeit will be taken
on a future occasion.
Nelson, as usua!. put In a hard day 3
work. He hit the road for ei^ht miles
in the morning wrapped in two heavy
sweaters.
In the afternoon about an hour was
spent in the gymnasium. The re
tion wcrk was indulged in and
Bat took on "Rawhide" Kelly, Bfl
Renner and Fred Landers for a
uf rounds each.
The mill with Landers was a give a- l
take affair and at the finish FTed was
ready to cave in. A brisk rubdown fol
lowed.
A large crowd is expected at thÂ«
quarters to-day to watch Bat work
Nelson has the better of the terms fT
the coming match, as he is guarantee
a large amount win, lose or dra\*
This was readily agreed to by Corbet r.
who Is anxious for a chance to Npta
his lost ring prestige at any cost.
Young Corbett and Joe Gans had a
severe trip on the road yesterday morn
ing, and as they were to box at the Au
tomobile Club dinner they did not don
the gloves during the afternoon. Gan.i
is as famous a worker on the road a*
he 'Â«< with the gloves and he makes Cor
be. step some.
The Denverite has made no effort up
to the present time to geÂ» down to a
low weight, saving his vitality as much
as possible. His programme calls for
him to weigh 129 pounds next Sunday.
With this leeway he expects to be able
to rest on Monday and Tuesday of
next week, the fight being scheduled
for the 2Sth inst.
Scottish Bowlers at Play.
Many of the Scottish bowlers figured
the green at the park would not be in
a fit condition to be played upon yes
terday, and the attendance vu rather
light. The rinks were not thoroughly
dry, but the men who were present
played some interesting matches. The
closest and best game of the day was â 
singles between G. C. Patterson ani
Joseph Gray. Play was even up to th-Â»
last "end," when Patterson score Â»
point and won the match by a 21-20
score.
Three doubles games were played,
two of which were exceedingly close.
In one Robert Park and A. A. Mt-
Vicar beat John McLaren and ]
Moffatt 21 to 18. Jnhn R*!d and J. C.

The Kosmos liner Denderah. which
arrived yesterday morning fratn Ham
burg by way of South and Central
American ports, brings the first news
-rom Nicaragua since the City of Syd
ney arrived with word of the eruption
of Mount Mouiotombo. When the Syd

The officers of the Denderah say that
affairs in Guatemala are critical. A
Guatemalan said to be prominent but
vhose name was not learned, boarded
the Denderah at San Jo?c. intending to
take passage to this port. A few min
utes after he came on board, however,
government officials visited the vessel,
seized the Guatemalan and took him
ashore. It was said that he had been
stirring utÂ» feeling against President
Cabrera and the government wanted
to keep him where he could be watched
and, if necessary, restrained.

STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Feb. 18.
The Stanford nine was defeated again
this afternoon In the fifth baseball
game of the preliminary series, St.
Mary's winning easily by the score ot
four to nothing. Ferguson, the Cath
olic collegians' twlrler, seemed to take
i to the wet going, and he kept the Car
dinal sluggers guessing all the time.
Sales, for Stanford, was also effective.
Had his team fielded in perfect s^yle
St. Mary's would not have scored. As
it was they gathered in one in the sec
ond on a hit and an overthrow by Stoll,
who tried to head off a runner at third
and then threw into left field; two
more in the sixth on more errors, and
another In the eighth on two successive
hits and a passed ball. The score:

PACIFIC COAST LEAGUE
IX HARMONY WITH THE EAST
President Powers Denies There Is Any
Trouble Brewing Between the
Organizations.
NEW YORK. Feb. 18.â President P.
T. Powers of the National Association
of Minor Baseball Leagues denied to
day that there was any trouble brew
ing between the Pacific Coast League
and the big organization, which is com
posed of every league In the country
outside of the two major leagues.
"We held a meeting to-day," said
Mr. Powers, "which was more of a
conference than anything else. All the
matters passed upon were of import
ance only to the members of the as
sociation. As for the Pacific Coast
League having any grievance with the
organization I can assure you that
there is no truth in such a rumor. I
have had several communications from
Eugene F. Burt of San Francisco and
he assures me that' his league is heart
ily in sympathy with every action
which the association has deemed fit to
take."

BOMB THROWN
AT LEGATION
Spaniard in Paris Attempts
to Get Eevenge on Mexico,
but Is Himself Injured
PARIS, Feb. 18.â Inhabitants of the
Champs Elysees quarter of Paris
aroused to-night by a loud explosion,
and the police, who were hurriedly
summoned, discovered In front of the
Mexican Legation a man severely
wounded and lying amid fragments of
a bomb. The man was taken to a hos
pital and cross-examined. He said his
name was Garcia and he was a Span
iard. He asserted that he had been
ruined by the Mexican Government
and in revenge threw a tiomb which,
however, exploded too soon, and he
himself was injured.
The police found a revolver, a dag
ger and some anarchist pamphlets on
Garcia and a search of his lodgings
led to the discovery of two bombs,
identical to that which he had explod
ed. Garcia arrived in Paris two days
ago. The prefect of police is person
ally investigating the case.
Garcia declares that he was born in
Santander in 1862 and denies being an
anarchist. He is wounded in the arms
.and hands. Prompt action by the po
lice prevented his being lynched.
The bomb was filled with dynamite
and the stone walls of the legation
were somewhat damaged.
MAY LEAD TO PEACE.
Indications That Russia Will Seek to
Knd the War.
ST. PETERSBURG, Feb. 18.â In dip
lomatic circles the opinion is senerally
expressed that yesterday's trasedy In
Moscow may be followed by the de
cision of the Government to conclude
peace. For some time, despite the of
ticial attitude maintained by the Gov
ernment, there has been a growing ap
preciation of the difficulties of prose
cuting the war in the jnidst of in
creasing complications at home.
Prince Friedrich Leopold of Prussia,
who had been visiting the Emperor,
started for Berlin at midnight.
It waa announced from Berlin on Fri
day that Prince Friedrlch Leopold was
to go to the Far East by steamship
from Genoa, owing to the difficulty in
sending his train quickly over the con
gested Siberian line, and that he would
first pay a visit to Emperor Nicholas.
A dispatch from St. Petersburg early
yesterday morning, however, threw a
different light on the Prince's visit to
St. Petersburg. It was intimated that
the Prince was the bearer of personal
representations from Emperor William
on the subject of peace, and it was
added that it was positively known
that the question of peace . was dis
cussed between Emperor Nicholas and
Prince Friedrich Leopold, though it
was impossible to ascertain what, if
any, conclusions were reached.
NO PEACE OVERTURES.
Japan Denies That She Has Spoken

"NOT GUILTY"
JURY'S VERDICT
Aged Citizen of Yreka Is
Given His Freedom After
Fourth Trial for Murder
Special Dispatch to The Call.
TREKA, Feb. 18.â Eight months ago
aged John H. Snyder was arrested for
killink George Potter and wounding
Donald McKay, an Indian, in his house
in Butte Creek Valley. To-day, after
his fourth trial, Snyder is free, a jury
having declared him not guilty of mur
der.
This is perhaps the most popular ver
dict ever rendered in this county in a
criminal case. The courtroom was
crowded with Snyder's friends and a
crowd gathered on the main street to
greet the old man as he left the court
room a free man.
Snyder shot George Potter in the
kitchen of his (Snyder's) home while
Potter was in the act of striking him
with a knife. After killing Potter Sny
der turned just in time to shoot Mc-
Kay in the cheek as the latter was
rushing for him with an ax.
Two half breeds from the Umpqua
country are in jail here on a charge of
perjury. They are accused of having
sworn falsely at the first trial of
Snyder.
RUSSIA DENIES THAT
MEN VIOLATED PAROLE
Believes Crew of the Lena Was Not
Obliged to Remain in Ameri
can Territory.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 18.â The three
officers of the Russian transport Lena,
who are accused of violating their
parole, are Engineer E. Kopazin and
Midshipmen Michaeloff and A. K. Dan
yan. A formal notification of the facts
in the case has been presented to Rus
sia by Secretary Hay.
ST. PETERSBURG. Feb. IS.â lt is
semi-offlcially declared that the charse
of a breach of parole against three offi
cers of the Russian auxiliary cruiser
Lena, at San Francisco, must be due
to a misunderstanding. As far ls is
known the officers have given no parole
to remain in American territory, and
the local administration could not.
therefore, be opposed to their depar
ture. It is believed that negotiations
concerning the affair will .result in the
clearing up of the matter to the mutual
satisfaction of Russia and America.

FORTUNE STOLEN
FROM A CLOSET
Massachusetts Man Loses
Box Holding Securities of
the Value of $258,000
BOSTON, Feb. IS.â Much mystery
surrounds the disappearance, an-
nounced by a law firm to-day, of se
curities said to bÂ« the property of a
client and to have a face value of
$258,000.
Beyond the information that the pa
pers, {50,000 of which are negotiable,
were removed from a safe or vault
about January 17, since which time un
successful efforts have been made to
locate them, little concerning the mat
ter is made public The name of the
owner and all information is withheld.
Among the missing securities was a
promissory note signed "G. Henry
Whitcomb. or his order." Whitcomb
is the former envelope manufacturer
of Worcester.
Attorney Hyde said to-night that his
client was a young man. a resident of;
Massachusetts, living outside of Bos
tcn, who had a fortune left him and
who was occupied solely with his in
vestments. He added:
"About January 1 this man took from
the safety deposit vault a box which
contained practically everything he had
in the world. He placed it in a closet
at his home and he knows it was there
on January 17. When he looked for it
last Monday it was not there."
What Befell Young Billups.
Mary Coles Carrington of Richmond

"One of the curious characteristics

no matter how twisted the lonsc words,
which are their delight.
" 'Aunt Dilsey. what has become of

TESTIMONIAL TO
L. M. GILLKTTS BARBER SCHOOL,
611 Commercial St.. San Francisco.
This la to certify that I, the undersigned,
have attended the largest and seemingly best
equipped barber college in San Francisco; for
some time I was Instructor for the largest
barber collece In this city and by far the
largest on the Pacific Coast. Notwithstanding .
this I Â«elt inefficient and not what I thought
a barber should be, therefore I left the posi-
tion where I was employed and took up a
two weeks' finishing cours? with Professor L.
M.' Gillett, giving full credit to the other col-
leges which I attended for their Instruction
anl the practice afforded to me. I must say,
however, that I have received more expert in-
struction from Professor L. M. Gillett In the
past two wt>eks than I did during the six
months spent In other colleges. The cause la
very simple; no other college in San Francisco
has an expert Instructor in the tonsorial art; |
they are not even first-class barbers.

Good Short Stories.
Many years of hard work on the i
farm had made the old man round- â¢
shouldered and his coat fitted badly I
His sen in the city sent him a coat i
stretcher on which to hang the coat at !
Dight. On his next visit to the farm I
the young man asked how the coat
stretcher worked. His father looked a
little embarrassed and th_n confessed: '
"I can't stand it on," said he. "It was
real good or you to send it. Your '
mother fastened it to my coat with i
tape, but I wasn't comfortable in it '
and; I had to take it off." I
There had been a railroad collision '
near a Scottish country town and an I
astute local t attorney had hurried to
the scene of disaster. Noticing an old â¢â 
man with a badly damaged head lying j
on the ground, he approached him with
notebook in hand. "How about dam
ages, my man?" he began. The in
jured man waved him on! with the re
mark: "Xa, na! yell get nae dam
ages t rae me. It wasna me that hit yer
bloomln* auld train."
A blushing and pretty Swedish girl
just arrived from the old country at
tended evening service at a. Duluth
church. The minister, seeing she was
a stranger, shook hands with her at
the close of the meeting and said he
would find pleasure in calling upon her
coon. Whereupon the girl .' hung her i
head and bashfully murmured, "Tank
you, but Ay have a 1a 1 fella."âC hicago j

FLAT MOUNTAIN
TOPS NUMEROUS
Strange Formations Cause
Region of Caura River
to Be Ranked as Unique
RORAIMA IS FAMOUS
Hundreds of Elevations Are
Crowned With Plateaus
Difficult of Approach
â² British naturalist named Andre
plungred a while agro Into the depths
of the tropical forest along the Caura
Fiver, one of the large southern tribu
taries of the Orinoco. On account of
Its numerous falls and rapids the Up
per Caura is very difficult of ascent,
and what Andre discovered shows how
little we know of large areas In South
America and especially of those cover
ed with great forests spreading away
between the equatorial rivers.
We had scarcely any Idea of the
plateaus he found ascending by a suc
cession of giant steps. The one near
est the Orinoco rises abruptly from an
elevation of 200 feet to 1000 feet above
the sea; the next to 1600 feet and the
third to 2000 feet at the foot of the
Merevari range, that limits the far
thest sources of the Caura. The best
maps before the public give no idea
of the nature of the country through
which the Caura flows as Andre has
Just described and mapped It in hlfl
book, "A Naturalist in the Guianas."
The most Interesting feature of his
work is the proof he bring that the so
called inaccessible mountains, pre
cipitous and flat-topped, extend far
end wide over the southern part of
Venezuela. The best known of them
Is Roralma, on the border between
British Guiana and Venesuela.
This giant, boxlike cube of earth,
far outtopping Mount "Washington in
altitude, is surrounded by other simi
lar masses, but it was not known that
these remarkable mountains are scat
tered far to the west. Andre discov
ered a number of them over 250 miles
to the west of Roralma. It is evident
that there is a whole series of them
rising high above the level of the
plateau a little north of the water
pcrting of the Orinoco and Amazon
systems.
All of these mountains are of the
same type, and the only important dif
ference between them seems to be that
they vary in size. Roraima has been
known for many years as presenting
uncommon problems for geographers.
In appearance it is most unusual, for it
is practically a cube of rock, standing
apart, rising to a height of nearly 9000
feet, the upper 2000 of which is appar
ently a precipice which was thought to
be impossible of ascent. But Im Thurn
found a way up the mountain in 1884,
and three men have since reached the
summit, two of them spending the night
on the surface of the lofty plateau.
These mountains, scattered far more
widely than was formerly supposed,
are almost as remarkable an illustra
tion of the power of â water In erosions
as our Colorado Canyon. They are all
that is left of a very high sandstone
plateau that countless ages ago cov
ered the whole of this region, so that
its surface was much higher above the
sea than it is to-day. The many
streams have cut away nearly all of the
plateau, leaving only these strange
mountains as memorials of the incalcu
lably distant, past.
In every case the upper parts of the
walls are sheer precipices, or nearly so,
but the talus piled against the foot has
made slopes by which the eminences
may be partly ascended. Only the top
of Roraima has been reached. Andre
spent days in the vain endeavor to get
to the summit of Ameha, and it is
doubtful if better success would have
rewarded him on the flanks of Arichi or
Arawa.
None of the lofty peaks of the Colom
bian Andes, he says, inspired him with
such a sense of awe and helplessness
as when he looked up at the mighty
and unscalable walls.
Curiosity as to what would be found
at the top has been gratified by the
ascents of Roraima. The whole ap
pearance of this twelve square miles of
surface is weird and fantastic. Oblong
stones appear mounted like cannon;
others on short stems of rock have the
appearance of umbrellas; still others
resemble miniature castles or tfce ruins
of churches. Small pools are scattered
here and there, but most of the pre
cipitation is soon carried over the sides
in splendid waterfalls. There are a few
butterflies and other insects, but the
vegetation is scanty and insignificant.
This is" a bit of nature that has had a
chance to be modified by very few of
the forms of animal life.â New York

Misery Loves Company.
At the recent Inauguration of Dr.
Flavel S. Luther as president of Trin
ity College, Hartford. Conn., this story
â¢was told by a student. Two or three
weeks ago Dr. Luther was riding on a
street car in Hartford, when he saw a
student crumpled up in a corner. The
young man was in very bad plight.
Hie clothing was stained, his linen
boiled, his hair unbrushed. His face
was pallid and his eyes were bloodshot
and dull. He looked ill; he looked a
â¢wreck, and it was easy to see what tne.
trouble was. Dr. Luther, fresh and
vigorous from his bath and his good
breakfast, rose to get off. As he passed
the unclean student he said grimly:
"Been on a drunk." The student's
sleepy eyes rolled languidly toward Dr.
Luther, and in a dull and listless
voice the young man said: "So have

Origin of the Monocle.
The proposal to permit the use of j
spectacles to British soldiers is a re- '
minder that from their prohibition
came the monocle, according to The
Buffalo Commercial. About a century
ago an army order was issued forbid
ding officers to wear eye-glasses or
spectacles. But a short-sighted officer
belonging to a crack cavalry regiment
had no mind to resign his commission
or stumble blindly, and he invented the
single eyeglass. When called to ac
count by the authorities he claimed
that the monocle, being of the singular
number, did not contravene the order
against spectacles and glasses in the
plural. Red tape accepted this literal
rendering of the law, and, becoming
popular in the British army, the mon
ocle was adopted by civilian beaus.â

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY. FEBRUARY 19. l? 05
GARDENS COST
MANY MILLIONS
English People Spend Coin
Freely to Provide Fine
Surroundings for Homes
SOME FAMOUS ORCHIDS
Army of Men Employed That
Country Shall Blossom
as the Proverbial Rose
It has been said that there are a
score of noblemen In the United King
dom who spend more every year on
their gardens than would pay the offi
cial salaries of the entire cabinet; and,
extravagant as the statement may ap
pear, it is well within the limits of the
truth.
Further than this, there are, on the
best authority, mora than 5000 "seats of
the mighty," or at least of the rich,
the gardens of which cost their owners
anything almost from $2500 a year up
ward, while there are as many more
which demand between $1000 and $2600
a year for their maintenance. Of these
10,000 British gardens an annual sum
estimated at over $10,000,000 is spent for
labor alo-ne, and another round mil
lion pounds at least goes in the pur
chase of seeds, plants and manures,
and the general upkeep of the gardens
and glass houses.
It is difficult and, perhaps Invidious
to say which are the most costly gar
dens In Great Britain, but among them
are certainly those of Trentham hall,
Welbeck abbey, Lord Bute's gardens at
Cardiff castle, the world-famous gar
dens of Chatsworth and those of the
Rothschilds, on which gold has been
lavished like water.
One gets an idea of the extent of such
gardens as these when he reads that
the kitchen garden at Welbeck covers
thirty acres, that the houses in which
peaches, apricots and nectarines are
grown stretch for a quarter of a mile,
Vnd that to- stock them costs mm much
as $60,000. When a millionaire sets hia
heart on making hrmself a lordly pleas
ure garden he recks little of the cost
Not long ago a rich man in the north
of England discovered that one section
! of his gardens was rendered useless
through exposure to the keen east wind.
i This was not to be tolerated. Bald the
great man, and to keep the- eastern
winds from trespassing he planted
thousands of Scotch and Norwegian fir
trees to act as a screen, paying as
much as $25 for Individual trees. This
little whim cost him nearly $100,000,
bat he considered himself amply re- !
warded by seeing his wilderness turned i
into a paradise of flowers.
In such gardens as these it is quite â 
usual to employ as many as seventy or
eighty men and boys, so that a cabinet
minister's yearly salary may easily go ,
in wages alone.
It is said that there are 900 country !
houses in Great Britain, each of which
employs a staff of over fifty men; of \
these, 200 employ between eighty and ;
150, while sixty of them employ over ]
200; and the large majority of all these ;
male servants are gardeners of one j
kind or another.
In addition to the cost of labor there
are repairs and alterations of houses,
furnaces to be fed, walls butlt for fruit
growing, nets for protection, tools to
buy and replace, and â often the most
costly item of allâ seeds and plants to
purchase. Baron Schroder is credited
with having spent $200,000 on his col
lection of orchids, and Sir Trevor Law
rence with an expenditure of $150,000.
Joseph Chamberlain has thirteen
glass houses containing, roughly, 6000
plants, many of them of great value
and gathered from almost every part of
the earth where orchids are to be
found. The plants are arranged in dif
ferent houses according to the time of
flowering, so that the succession of ex
quisite flowers never fails the whole
year round. Each plant bears its num
ber as well as its name, and it is said
that Mr. Chamberlain knows every one
of his floral pets.
, King Edward Loses His Claim.
Had he but preserved the life of a
mining claim that was deeded to him
about two years ago his Majesty King
Edward VII would now be on a fair
road to increase his private fortune by
the addition of a considerable quantity
of virgin gold taken fresh from the
auriferous gravels of the Yukon.
It was on February 10, 1903, that Mr.
Sparling, in a spirit of generosity and
loyalty to his King, determined to deed
to his Majesty the Eureka Creek claim,
upon which the depth, breadth, extent
and richness of the pay streak were yet
to be ascertained. So a quitclaim deed
was made out wherein J. K. Sparling
was nominated as the party of the first
part and King Edward VII as the party
of the second part. It was duly signed,
sealed and acknowledged, $2 was paid
for the recording of the same, though
the regulations were violated in not
demanding the date and number of his
Majesty's license, and to-day the book
of records for Eureka Creek shows the
transaction to have been made in due
form and in perfectly proper manner.
This is the last entry in the book. The
work required by the regulations has
not been performed and the claim is
open to relocation. In other words,
any old sort of a man may jump his
Majesty's ground and he will have no
more redress than the commonest, most
itinerant of his subjects, and posterity
might have forgotten the fact that
their sovereign was at one time their
neighbor had it not been for the per
sistent prospecting of those who own
the adjoining land, which is very valu
able. â Yukon World.
Queen Draga's Marginal Notes.
It is said that just before she was |
murdered Queen Draga had been read- !
Ing a book of Stendhal's "De !
l'Araour." One of the assassins, not I
well acquainted with French litera- j
ture, picked up the volume and said J
to a comrade: "Just the sort of thing '
a shameless women would read!"
The other worthy had some literary
taste, and, examining the book, was
very much struck by the notes in the
queen's hand on the margin of many
a page. According to a German j
paper, he wrote to a friend this in- |
teresting confession: "What moved j
me most deeply was not my share of '
that horrible drama, not the sight of ;
the mutilated corpses, not the ferocity 'â 
of that bloody night, but the revela- I
tion in this little book of a certain
nobility In the soul of this ambitions j
Queen, whom hatred and fanaticism
had caused me to misjudge." â London

GREAT SLAUGHTER
FOR SAKE OF FURS
Yet Only Few Species of the Animals
Seem in Danger of Extinc
tion.
Few persons not connected with the
fur trade have any notion of the
enormous destruction of animal life
which takes place each year among
the fur-bearing animals or of the ex
traordinary way in which the supply
of these animals appears to keep up.
There are only a few species which
seem to be verging toward extinction;
such are the sea otter, the beaver
over large tracts of country, certain
sorts ot fur seals and a West African
monkey. Northern Asia and Nothern
North America still produce vast
quantities of fur and will long con
tinue to do so.
Perhaps the most valuable fur in
the world Is that of the sea otter, for
merly abundant on the shores of the
Pacific Ocean, in Northern Asia and
North America, but now in great
danger of extermination, unless it
shall soon be efficiently protected.
Between 17*72 and 1774 10,000 skins
of the sea otter were taken in the
Aleutian Islands, and the fur was so
eagerly sought after that at the end
of the eighteenth century 120,000
skins were taken each year.
The result of such destruction could
not be doubtful. The number killed
soon fell to 15,000 each year, and in
1867, when Alaska was sold to the
United States, it Was 700. In 1901 it
was 406, while in 1903 Messrs. Lamp
son & Co. of London sold 463 skins,
but they "had none in January, 1904,
and none in October. It is not unÂ«
usual for a sea otter skin to sell for
$500, while remarkably good skins
may bring two, three or five times
that price.
The only skin which approaches the
sea otter in value is that of the black
or silver fox. It is said that good
skins of the black fox have been sold
in St. Petersburg at from $1500 to
S4OOO. A pair of silver skins in Lon
don sold for $2400, while a single
skin is said to have brought $1000.
The Arctic foxes known as white
fox and blue fox are in great demand.
In 1903 Lampson & Co. sold more
than 20,000 white skins and nearly
3700 blue ones. Both these skins
seem to be increasing in value. It is
not long since the price of white
fox skins ranged from $1 to $4. They
are now said to be worth from $16 to
$UF., while the price of the blue fox
skins runs from $50 to $T5.
Almost 50,000 wolverine skins were
sold in London last year at prices
ranging from $4 to $S for good skins.
Of Russian sable nearly 30,000 were
sold, or three times as many as were
sold in all London in 1891. These ex
pensive furs range from $2 50 to $75
in price, but occasionally skins are
"found which bring from $250 to $350
each. The Siberian sable, which is
much more abundant â more than
470,000 skins having been sold last
year â is an inexpensive fur, worth
only about 50 cents apiece.
Mink and marten are cheap furs
and bring low prices, but the best pine
marten bring from $7 50 to $12 50.
Otter skins again are costly, as are
beaver, the supply of which, as has
been said, seems to be failing.
"What is this?" asked Mr. Pneer,
stopping a moment at the novelty
counter. â¢
"This is a handy little arrangement
for carrying your loose change," said
the salesman, proceeding to show him
a new style of coin holder.
"Loo^e change? I never have any,"
replied Mr. Pneer, passing on.
BOERS MAY TREK AGAIN
TO GERMAN EAST AFRICA
Plan of Dissatisfied Burghers to Get
Permanently Beyond England*
Hated Reach.
The Dutch farmers in South Africa
began to trek away from the Eng
lishmen as early at 1835. It was not
so much that they objected to them as
neighbors; what they couldn't stand
was the English silliness and meddle
someness about the blacks whom the
Lord had delivered into their hands,
even as the Canaanites were delivered
into the hands of the children of Is
rael. When their Kaffir slaves were
taken away from them by the eman
cipation of 1833 the angrier of the
Dutch farmers felt that they owed it
to their resentment to trek; the Cape
was no longer any place for them.
They inspanned and made off to and
across the Orange River. The history
of those parts during the next thir
teen years is largely a history of Boer
treks. In 1848 came the great trek
under Pretorius, the crossing of the
Vaal and the founding of the South
African republic.
The South African is now a
memory, and some of the sturdy men
of the farm who were its burghers in
peace and its sharpshooters in war
have begun to develop symptoms oJ
the hereditary treking fever, it ap
pears. Last May a Boer congress at
Pretoria sent a committee to take a
look at certain practically unoccupied
lands in German East Africa. A
brother of General Botha was a mem
ber of it.
He tells the Usambara Post that the
things seen and hear delighted the
committee. Between Mount Kiliman
jaro and Mount Meru are several thou
sand square miles of rolling prairie â
as fine a grazing country as heart
could wish, with plenty of choice spots
for farms. The German authorities
are reported eager to welcome the
Boers, and deal liberally with them in
the matter of homestead allotments.
They say that there must be, taking
highlands and lowlands together.
40,000 to 60,000 square miles of good
land awaiting settlement. To the
Deutsche Welt a former Governor,
General yon Liebert, has written:
"Every one who knows the country
in the neighborhood of Kilmanjaro
will follow with the deepest interest
the proposed opening of this region by
Boer immigrants. I believe this prcK
ject will have the highest importance
for the future of the colony. This
movement of the Boer 3 should be
facilitated in every way, and we shall
be able to learn much from them as to
the best methods of introducing Ger
man farmers also into East Africa."
All of which creates a presumption
at least that Edward VII iÂ«Â» about to
lose some thousands of valuable sub
jects â who talk Taal but read Dutch
Bibles and sing Dutch hymns out
of his colony of the Transvaal. How
they will like being subjects of the
Kaiser after they have tried it for
few years is another Question. â Hart

MOST EXPORTERS PREFER
GOLD I.V SHAPE OF BARS
How the Supply Keeps Upâ Stories
of the Assay Of
fice.
In each of the last four weeks an
nouncement has been made that the
Government's supply of gold bars had
been exhausted. Yet a few days after
each assertion it was announced that
the assay office would furnish from
$500,000 to $i, 000.000 more in bars
for shipment to Europe. This has
puzzled many people not familiar with.
the Government practice of manufac
turing bars for export purposes. In
busy seasons from $750,000 to $1 -.
000,000 a week is turned out in large
bars at the dingy little assay offkft
adjoining the subtreasury in Wall
street. These may be made from
ore from foreign coin, even from ves
sels and ornaments sold by private In
dividuals to the Government for cur.
rency. Cast-off trousers of the em
ployes of the assay office sometimes
yield a large amount of gold dust
when burned. It often happens that
the old clothing of the men is im
mensely more valuable when dis
carded than before use.
The bars weigh about 400 ounces
each and contain gold valued at
$8000. The Government supplies thÂ«
bars for export at a charge of $400
per $1,000,000 furnished, and tne de
mand for nearly a month now has
been in excess of supply.
When bars have not been available
the bankers have taken coin, al
though the expense of coin shipments
is usually much greater than the cost
of sending bars. This arises from thÂ«
loss through abrasion and the diffi
culty of securing full weight coin for
export transactions. Although thm
difference varies, sometimes amount
ing to an increased cost, as com
pared with bar shipments, of $200 on
each $1,000,000 of coin shipped. tnÂ«
statement was made in banking cir
cles this week that the Government
could make the export price of bars *
ce " ts P er * 10( > instead of 4 cents, and
still force the bankers to use them
in export transactions. It is improb
able that such action will be taken
however, although similar steps have
been at times discussed in treasury
circles. â New York Evening Post.
How "Dave" Henderson Escaped.

Beans and Seeds.
The situation In Beana Is gradually Improv

couth by a large local house has led others
into the field, and the buying Is now general,
the market being firm at the advance already
noted. Reports from the East/ are very bullish,
specifying, heavy orders In New York for
Whites for Cuba and the West Indies, with
some orders also for England and the Conti
nent. It is further stated that stocks of for
eign Beana In this country February 1 were
not over 25 cars, against 400 last year.

Potatoes. Onions and Vegetables.
Trade In table Potatoes was oj a light job
bing character and confined to the purchasing
of small lota of prime fancy .^toi-k, the cheap
er sorts of Burbanks being neglected. Firm
prices ruled for all seed varieties and a few
small lots of Oregon Garnet Chiles, ex-steamer,
met with prompt sale at an advance. There
were no new arrivals of Onions from the
north and stocks on hand were firmly held at
the recently advanced quotations.
Receipts of southern vegetables consisted of
eight sacks of Peas and one sack of String
Bean*, and receivers were able to get almost
any price they asked for fresh offerings. Car
ried-over lots of other descriptions sold at
about previous prices. Asparagus brought 35@

Poultry and Game.
Poultry closed the week with the market
In excellent shape for the selling interests and
there was very little stock unsold at the close.
Leading handlers reported that, owing to the
heavy storms in the Middle West, the receipts
from that< source would be very light during
the ensuing week and a firm market la ex
pected for all descriptions of domestic stock.
Six carloads of Western were marketed last
week. There were no changes in Game, re

the demand.

Butter, Cheese and Eggs.
All three descriptions are now meeting with
some shipping orders, chiefly for the north,
and stocks have become somewhat smaller in
consequence, though there la still plenty of
Butter and Eggs on hand. The exhaustion
of the supply of cube Butter has led to an
expanded demand for cheap fresh grades,
which are consequently flrmer and in better
movement than the fine creameries, as already
mentioned. There is no further advance in
Cheese. The Egg market is steady, but re
ceipts are gradually Increasing and nobody
wants to hold the goods.

Deciduous ant} Citrus Fruits.
The market for fresh fruits has been dull
and listless throughout the past week, with
buyers refusing to take any more than abso
lutely necessary for daily requirements. Weath
er conditions have been against trade in 'Citrus
fruits for some time and. although the daily
receipts have been comparatively light, there
la a heavy accumulation of Oranges on hand.
Mexican Limes are scarce and firm, but all
other Citrus fruits are plentiful and weak.
At to-morrow's auction sale eight or ten car
loaas of Navel Oranges. Including the five
cars that were to have been sold on Friday,
will be offered. The situation In Apples was
unchanged. Fine Newtown Pippins and Spltz
enbergs were firmly held at high prices, while
large lines of ordinary fruit were being pressed
for eale at the inside quotations.

Hams, Bacon and Lard have all gone up to

said: "Speculative situation is still un
changed. Packers continue to report a de
cidedly disappointing cash situation. Their
stocks are accumulating with Hogs coming to
market In liberal numbers. While these con
ditions last we are unable to see any prospect
for improvement in the speculative market.
The packers are likely to continue supporting

NEW CHARGE
INVOLVING
OIL TRUST
Representative Campbell of
Kansas Accuses Standard
of Illegal Collusion With
Railroads of the State
PLACES THE FACTS
BEFORE GABFIELD
States That Corporation
Has Thus Driven All of
Its Competitors From the
Field. Securing Monopoly
CALL BUREAU. POST BUILDING.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 18.â Representa
tive Oampoell of Kansas, whose reso
lution in the House prompted the in
jration of the Standard Oil Com
pany, had a long and important con
ference with Commissioner Garfleld at
the Bureau of Corporations to-night,
and laid before him in detail the most
serious charges against the Standard
Oil Company.
Campbell's charges involve railroads
of Kansas, which he says, acted in
collusion with the Standard Oil Com
pany in driving out of business its
competitors in Kansas, the Humboldt
Refinery and the Moran Crude Oil
Company. The Humboldt Refinery had
a market for fuel oil at Kansas City,
Mo., when, according to the charges,
on account of the pressure from the
Standard Oil Trust, the railroad rate
from Humboldt to Kansas City was
suddenly raised 7 cents per hundred
pounds, which drove the Humboldt Re
finery to the wall.
Another specific instance or . this
character Is related In the case of the
Moran Crude Oil Company, which was
compelled by the railroads to pay hji
advance of 34 cents a barrel in freight
rates, und on this account was unable
to continue in business.
Campbells conference with Commis
sioner Garfield was held for the pur
pose of facilitating the investigation in
Kansas which will be begun at once,
completed and reported to the Presi
dent before the general inquiry has
ended. The representations made to
right will bo made the basis of the in
vestigation. They are considered most
important here because the Kansas
representative and the men who are
with him in his State are leaving no
vtone unturned to forcf the criminal
ution of the trust. Campbell said
to-night:
While the anti-trust bills were
ng in the Kansas Legislature, the
Standard Oi! Company sent a lobby to
Topeka to obstruct the bills, but the
atmosphere became overheated and
they left. At a means of retaliation
the company last week announced that
uld do no more business in the
- for the present, which amounted
to a boycott of the producers. Evi
dently the resolution passed by the
House of Representatives on Wednes
day, calling for an investigation of this
boycott order, together with the
prompt action of the Executive De
partment, callinp for an investigation,
moved the Standard Oil Company to
remove the boycott."
i'EKA. Kans.. Feb. 18.â It is ex
pected that the investigation of Stan
dard Oil affairs in Kansas will begin
at once. Governor Hoch was notified
to-day that six inspectors had been or
dered to Kansas to work on the case.
They will report their findings to Corn-
Corporations Garfleld.
The State officers will aid the inspect
ors- in every way possible.
Th.- anti-discrimination bill will go
before the House on Monday and has
>d chance of being passed.
In an authorized statement given
out to-night former Secretary of the
nr Hok*Â» Smith replies to" a state
ment by Secretary Hitchcock regard-
Ing the action of Smith in approving
ar. oil and sras lease made with the
Ofage Indians in 1896. Smith says
that when the lease wns approved no
oil had been found in Texas and not a
great deal in Kansas. A lease was ap
plied for by E. B. Foster to prospect
end bore for oil and gas. The Osage
nal Council passed an act direct-
Inp the leaj- Q . which required payment
of ample royalties to the Indians in
case oil or pas were found. The lease
was rerom mended by Colonel Freeman
or the United States army, acting In
dian agent for the Osage tribe.

PANAMA ROAD
DESIRES TIME
President Requested to Put
Off Date of Cancellation
of Pacific Mail Contract
6DecUl Dlsoatch to ThÂ« Call.
CALL BUREAU, POST BUILDING,
WASHINGTON, Feb. 18. â Secretary
Tiift reported. to the President on his
return to Washington from his inspec
tion trip to Panama that the contract
beween the Pacific Mail Company and
the Panama Railroad could be termi
nated on a notice of six months. No
such notice has been given and the
Southern Pacific Company is under
stood to have asked the President for
more time, claiming that to abrogate
the contract and make the Panama
Railroad an opponent of the trans
continental railroads would unsettle
rates and make no end of trouble. On
thY other hand the President has been
told that the agreement is in restraint
of tradt and that If it were abrogated
there w*ould be a great increase in divi
dends to the railroad and a faljing in
freight rates.
The following extract from the min
utes of the Isthmian Canal Commis
sion of the meeting held on October
11 last, explanatory of the directors'
fees taken from the Panama Railroad
Company by members of the canal
commission, was placed before the
House Committee on Interstate and
Foreign Commerce at the conclusion
of its hearing to-day by Chairman
Hepburn, having been received by him
from Commissioners Harrod and
j Grunsky in letters dated to-day:
"The Commissioners were also in
formed by the chairman that at a re
! ( <-nt conference with the President the
: n.atter of attendance fees paid to the
directors attending meetings provided
( by the by-laws of the Panama Rail-
I n>ad Company was referred to and
that the President desired the commis
sion to be informed that his order flx-
Ji.g thp compensation of the Commis
! sioners was not intended to prevent
; the acceptance of such fees."
OWUMBKT STATES POSITION.
The letter of Commissioner Grunsky
incloses a communication from him to
Vice President Drake of the railroad
company of September 13 last, in which
he returns "unopened" an envelope con
taining his fee for the first meeting he
attended. He states that he did not
refuse the envelope at the time it was
handed to him at the close of the
I meeting because he did not wish to em
! ltarrass his associates -on the commis
. sion. He says he could not construe
the attendance fee other than compen
sation, and must decline to accept it.
Vice President Drake resumed his
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, FEBRUARY 19, 1905.
testimony. Chairman Hepburn im
mediately took up the matter of pay
ments for attendance at the, meetings
of the board of directors and of the ex
exutive committee ofi^the company.
GOVERN MEXT'S DIVIDENDS.
Speaking of the $250,000 paid to Co
lombia each year, Drake said that he
understood it would be necessary to
pay this sum as long as the concession
ran, which would be until 1969. This
money, he said, is now to be paid to
Panama. It was Drake's opinion that
the railroad would continue to do busi
ness and be an important factor when
the canal Is constructed. Replying to
Wagner, he said that the Southern Pa
cific Company o^ned the controlling
interest in the Pacific Mail Company.
From Attorney William Nelson
Cromwell it was learned that the
United States received in cash on Feb
ruary 1, this year, the sum of $334, 935,
as its first dividend.
"To whom was that paid?" was
asked.
"All of this sum was paid by check
to the Secretary of War as a dividend
on the stock standing In his name,
with the exception of a dividend on
ninety-four shares in the name of Ad
miral Walker, chairman of the Isth
mian Canal Commission, which divi
dend was paid to him directly. The
dividend on thÂ« other remaining seven
shares was paid directly to the ordei
of the seven gentlemen In whose
names they respectively stand."
ADMTRAI* WAJDKER EXPLAINS.
Regarding the question of fees tor
attendance accepted by the Isthmian
Canal Commissioners as directors of
the Panama Railroad, Admiral
Walker, chairman of the committee,
said:
"Every corporation pays attendance
fees to its directors. When the mem
bers of the canal commission were
made directors of the Panama Rail
road Company this matter of attend
ance fees was taken up. Some of the
Commissioners thought that they were
entitled to these fees and others
thought not. As chairman of the com
mission I went to, President Roosevelt
and told him that under the Presi
dent's order there was a difference of
opinion among the members of the
commission ac to whether they should
accept attendance fees. The Presi
dent said that these fees should bft
taken as a matter of course and that
the matter was too small to talk
about.
"All this stock ia held in trust for
the United States. All of these shares
belong to the Government and no
member of the commission holds any
of the stock personally or to his own
profit In any way."

Special Dispatch to The Call.
PORTLAND, Feb. 18.â The wrath of
a husband and father overcame his re
spect for the court to-day when he
saw his 16-year-old daughter seated
beside the man whom the prosecution
alleges attacked the girl a short time
ago. Theopolus Hatch could not bear
the spectacle and he sprang upon Dr.

away, furious and cursing the man
who had broken up his home.
Dr. Hughes, who was arrested in

The employes of Hale Brothers, in
corporated, were given a treat at Stein
way Hall last night in an illustrated
lecture on "The Louisiana Exposition"
by James W. Erwin, who had charge
of the San Francisco building at the
fair. From the cash boys to the presi
dent of the big dry goods house all
were present, making an audience of
nearly 500 persons.
Those who did not see the fair were
given the best idea that could be had
of it last night by Mr. Erwin with
words and pictures. He took his audi
ence from the beginning to the end of
the fair. Pictures of the buildings and
the grounds were shown by stereopti
con. Scenes taken at night and by
day when the fair was at its height
gave the attendance an excellent Idea
of what the Louisiana Exposition was
like.
Mr. Erwin's description of the fair
held his listeners' closest attention. His
description of the last night of the fair.
whan the lights were fading away,
waff enchanting.
Mr. R. B. Hale made a short address
before the lecturer appeared, in which
he said he was fulfilling a promise
made to the employes of the house
when he was about to leave for the ex
position.
Mrs. Sadie Miller entertained the au
dience with several piano selections and
Miss Frances Bailey rendered two vo
cal selections that were appreciated.
TANANA MINERS
ARE BUNKOED
Dawson Wholesalers Palm
Off Their Bad Eggs on
3ferchants of Rival Town
Special Dispatch to ThÂ« Call.
TACOMA, Feb. 18. â The Tanana
mining district has been bunkoed by
the Dawson wholesalers. To Tanana
camp last summer were shipped all
the old eggs which Dawson had on
hand. The eggs were too strong to
sell readily and were displaced at
Dawson by fresh stock. Tanana was
"jobbed" in the usual frontier style
and got the ancient stock.
Stories are coming from Tanana
now about the eggs hatching or being
so awful bad that they cannot be de
pended on. Bear grease, onions, lim
burger and a few other potent arti
cles of food were mixed with the eggs,
but even this addition failed to make
them palatable. The Tanana egg
supply would have been exhausted
long ago but for the fact that the eggs
asserted themselves.
