victim of a fiendish practical joke per
petrated by. a number of young bloods
a few nights ago. Air of the partici

about the affair, and the victim was
buried with a certificate from the Cor

In an orgie, for which one at least of
the participants has come to regret the
part he played In 1 1.
The affair was Intended as a . Joke.
Goodlow was accused of some Imag

to mete out to him the punishment
which they pretended he so richly de
served. After tif ing him 'with ' ropes
and nailing his feet to aboard he was
covered with wood and shavings and a
kerosene rag placed near his nose so
that he would get the smell: A bucket
of water, which- the victim was in
formed was coal- oil, was thrown upon
him and preparations were made to,ap
ply the torch .when the old man ceased
his outcries.
Then the jesting ceased'. The Â¦ jokers
realized their fun had been carried too
far. They removed : the ; debris and be
gan to untie the negro. When it was
discovered thati he w ; as dead he was
carried quietly away and dumped '. into

Thorndike fired three times and
each'of the bullets went through the

When Thorndike reached the door
he ran downstairs. A minute later
Guiltenan had recovered his conj
posure, and, revolver in hand, started
down the stairs after the man. When
he reached the sidewalk - Thorndike
was turning into Fountain, allev and
Guiltenan nred his revolver to attract
the police. The robber ran along
south on Second street and Guiltenan
followed at a short distance behind.
Turning uo Third street Thorndike
ran into Policeman Theodore Swen
son at the 'corner, of Third. The po
liceman ordered the man to halt, but
he .paid no attention and when the
officer tried to head him off. he drew
hia revolver and fired -at- him. Swen
son was not ten feet away and he at
once fired at the fleeing man. ;
The inmates of the place were then
lined ud- with their hands above their
heads. Reaching into a drawer of the
table Thorndike filled his pockets with
gold pieces and then expressed a desire
for a ?1000 diamond ring that glistened
on the finger of William George.' The
ring was at once handed over and
placing it on his finger the robber
backed out of the place keeping the
men in the room covered with his guns.
No attempt was made to rob the men
in the place, and the fellow did not
speak a dozen words. He went about

SAN JOSE, April 24.â Driven to des
peration by his losses on the races and
gambling," Albert P. Thorndike, a pop
ular young society and business man.
essayed the ; role of a masked robber
this morning to recoup his finances.
At the Del Monte Social Club, a well
known resort, he held up five of the in
mates, took a $1000 diamond ring from
one of the proprietors and then tilled
his pockets with twenty-dollar pieces
from the drawer. In an hour he was
captured by- the police. He had two
mortal wounds in his head and soon oc
cupied a slab in the morgue.
! To enter upon this sensational career,
Thc-rndike had left his wife and baby
in a luxurious-. home on Stockton ave

had driven him insane, and . that for

A rumor was circulated "that Thorn

nered, but this is dispelled by the fact
that he was not powder burned. Be
yond all of doubt Officer
Fwenson 'inflicted the three wounds.
Chief Carroll in speaking of the crlms
stated he believed that Thorndike
through his losses in gambling on the
races and otherwise was tempted, to
commit" the robbery. ThÂ«* revolvers
found on thÂ«Â» dead man were of the
cheapest kind.
An inquest will be held to-morrow
afternoon at 2 o'clock over the remains
of Thorndike. No new developments
are looked for. except that testimony
will be introduced tending to show that
hi* mind was diseased. The body, of
the dead man was removed v from the

from the dying man. He asked him
who he was and he answered v.hat
sounded like "Bob Lee." Ho wa3
asked if he was from Sacramento and
he nodded his head. No one present,
and there was a score of spectators,
recognized the body as that of Thorn
dike. A search, of the b9dy disclosed
$373 30, nearly all in gold, and the dia
mond ring taken from George. Be
neath the alpaca duster and overalls
were a light coat, red sweater and
striped trousers.
Albert P. Thorndike was about 3ft
years of age. His mother, who is
wealthy, is living in Stockton. He was
raised -in San Jose. Ten years ago he
married Miss Bertha Bruce, a popular
young society girl and daughter of tbjq

SpÂ«cJal Dispatch to The Call
NEW YORK. April 24.â Robert Hynd
man, suffering from ear trouble, sud
denly became a raving maniac at the
Manhattan Eye and Ear Hospital last
night at midnight. He crashed the
panes ot a sixth floor window, mounted
the sill in full view of those in the
street and proceeded to execute crazy
war dances on the narrow ledge,
screaming like an Indian and defying
all to try and dislodge him. Pacific
measures failed.
Police were called, but they' were
fearful the madman would jump into
the street if they approached from the
inside.
The fire department was then called
out and an extension ladder was raised
until its top rung barely reached the
sixth floor. Captain Clark said he
would go up with such men as cared
to follow him. Two firemen stepped
forward, and Clark stealthily made his
way up the ladder with them beside
him.
A sudden shout from inside uttered
at the right moment made Hnydman
turn his head just as Clark gained the
ledge. Instantly the fire captain flung
his left arm about the insane man's
neck and tried to choke him. In spite
of Clark's strength, however, he had
an adversary equally, , as powerful.
Hyndman's grip never relaxed, and he
threw Clark about as a terrier would
a rat- ?j- \
Desperately the midair battle was
fought, while powerless spectators
looked on, expecting that every step
would send both men headlong to the
earth. On the top rungs of the ladder
Scanlon and Kimler w^ere reaching: out
their arms toward the combatants, and
eventually they caught hold of Hynd
man'fl legs. Even then the efforts of
the firemen were almost as nothing to
the maniacal strength of the man they
were trying to subdue.
In a moment, however, Scanlon and
Kimler had pushed their way onto the
ledge and fell in a heap on the fighting
men. Then through the window the po
licemen reached out and dragged the
four men over the ledge and into the
room, where they fell struggling on the
floor.
Hyndman was subdued with difficul
ty, and fought until he was taken to
the Bellevue Hospital.
HOME. April 24.â President Loubet,
accompanied by Foreign Minister Del
casse and a distinguished party of
French officials, arrived In Rome to
day to repay the visit of King Victor
Emmanuel to Paris in October last.
Th^y were met at the station by the
King, who went in state, accompanied
by the Duke of Genoa, the Count of
Turin and other court dignitaries. At
the station also were the members of
the Italian Cabinet, representatives of
the Senate. Chamber of Deputies and
til the high officers of state.
As the President stepped from the
train the Prince of Colonna, Mayor of
Rome, formally welcomed him on be
half of the city. The King and the
President embraced each other, while
the "Marsellaise"* was played by sev
eral bands.
The drive to the Quirinal was then
taken up and it had all the appearance
cf. a triumphal march, culminating in
en ovation at the palace, where Presi
dent Loub^t. King Victor Emmanuel,
Queen Helena and the Princes were
obliged to appear on the balcony three
times.
Embassador Meyrr. Charlemagne
Tower. United States Embassador to
Germany, and Andrew D. White, the
lormer Embassador to Germany, wit
nessed the passage nf the procession
from the garden of the American
Church, in which a tribune has been
erected. On this tribune were also
many members of the diplomatic corps
f>res*nt and several Americans, lnclud
ng Bishop Leonard of Ohio and G. B.
Thomas of Philadelphia. Along the
route were massed more than 600,000
persons, including many from the prov
inces and abroad.
Immediately after she had welcomed
President Loubet, Queen Helena sent a
cordial telegram to Mme. Loubet, say
ing "that the rejoicing to-day only
lacked the presence of her, whose
amiability had won her -tfTTections
while in Paris."
AH Rome was magnificently illumi
nated to-*nlght. A torchlight proces
sior in which 15.000 persons participat
ed produced a fantastic effect. The
procession crossed th<? town to the
Quirlnal. where it made an imposing
demonstration and was witnessed by
100,000 persons. President Loubet, the
King and Queen and the Princes saw
the torchlight procession from the bal
cony of tho Quirinal. on which they
remained for twenty minutes, being
constantly acclaimed.
From an official source it is learned
that Italy desires to prove that, while
loyal to the Triple Alliance, she is quite
free to maintain friendly relations with
other powers, hating for her object the
maintenance of peace.
President Loubet dined with the King
and Queen at the Quirinal.

ST. PETERSBURG. April 24.â In di
plomatic circles a great deal of impor
tance is laid upon the return of French
Embassador Bompard to-morrow. It
being supposed that he brings in his
rccket some plan for the solution of
the question regarding a cessation of
hostilities. However, the diplomatists
have proved themselves the sorriest
prophets in the past few months and I
may assure you that their opinions and
hopes are now little likely to be real
ized. The suggestion of intervention,
even upon the assumption of one Rus
sian victory, Ik met here with a howl
of derision! The Novoe Vremya say3
the question is not to be discussed, and
this reflects the general opinion.
1 am told that among the losses on
the Petropaviovsk was a large sum of
moneyâ especially large owing to the
Government foreseeing the probability
of Port Arthur being cut off and it wa3
thought necessary to have a big fund
there, which was in the hands of the
naval commander and the Petropav
iovsk happened to be the treasure ship.
I have heard the sum placed as high
as $12,000,000.

SEOUL, Korea, April 24.â That the
civil as well as the military occupation
of Korea is effective is evidenced by
the economic development under con

Japanese bank, has opened a branch
at Anju for the purpose of handling
military funds and engaging in bul-Â«
lion and specie transactions with the
American mines at Unsan. A Korean
bank has been long desired, but it had
not been established, owing to the lack
of public confidence- in the integrity
of a Korean management. Matsu

If these plans should succeed, the life
of both Russian squadrons in the Pa
c'fic would be menaced, and, with the
sea and a fleet back of her at every
point, Japan could fortify the positions
thus gained and. with the tables turned,
compel General Kuropatkin to comf*
forward and attack.
General Kuropatkin, however, is in
possession of the latest advices re
ceived by the general staff and It Is
safe to aspume that if the Japanese
campaign develops along the lines in
dicated he will be ready to make such
disposition of his forces as will meet
and checkmate it.
The Finance Ministry has decided to
provide the Manchurian administra
tion with bars of silver for the purpose
of redeeming bank notes on demand,
in order to prevent the lowering of the
price of the ruble.
The general staff reports say that
the Japanese will have three other ob
jectives â the occupation of a line across
the Liaoyang peninsula for the purpose
of cutting off Port Arthur, the isolation
of Vladivostok and the establishment
of a junction between the army <".f
Korea and the force at the head of tin:
Liactung peninsula. The last mentioned
movement might be accomplished by a
landing near the mouth of the Tayanx
River, which, by threatening the flank
of the Russian position at Fengwang
cheng, might render it untenable and
make the advance of a column from
Korea comparatively easy. â¢
ST. PETERSBURG. April 24.âAppar
ently reliable information in the pos
session of the general staff leads to
the belief that the objective of the Jap
anese campaign does not involve ths
ambitious invasion of the interior cf
Manchuria with the purpose of reach
ing and overwhelming the main Rus
sian army. If the Japanese ever en
tertained the hope of accomplishing a
task similar to that to which Napoleon
set himself, present advices Indicate
that they have abandoned it and have
adopted a much more cautious and
less hazardous programme.
If this information is correct there
will be no advance upon the army
concentrated at Liaoyang and Mukden,
vith its attendant constant lengthen
ing and weakening of the Japanese line
of communications. Instead, there
EC-ems to be a determination to keep
as close as is possible to the sea, where

cation, she having establfshed herself

It Is proof convincing for the most skep-

F. LÂ». Smith, boxmaker in the National
Box Factory, residence 741 Folsom
street, says: "If I was not thoroughly
Impressed with the fact that Doan's Kld-
r.ey Pills can be depended upon I would
never Siave gone out- of my way to rec-
ommend the preparation to others suffer-
ing* from kidney complaint. Before I
took a course of the treatment I had
tried more than onÂ© standard remedy,
but the results, as far as stopping the
trouble, were Just as remotely in the dis-
tance as when I first noticed that my
kidneys were out of order. A sure Indi-
cation that In pome way .the action of
my kidneys was upset was too frequent
action of the kidney secretions, added to
the backache, particularly if I contracted
a cold. For the last six months there
has not been an Indication of either ex-
cited or weakened kidneys."

The protest of the citizens will

and they are doing nil in their power

nuisance. He previously vetoed the
ordinance, and should he take similar
action to-day and be upheld by the

A lengthy set of resolutions con

KANSAS CITY. April 24. â Unusual
ly heavy rain and wind storms, caus
ing more or less damage, prevailed in
Western Missouri and Eastern and
Central Kansas to-day, with a blizzard
In Western Kansas. Small streams in
Kansas are over their banks and many
telephone and telegraph poles have
been blown down. One drowning Is
reported.
A"t Odessa, Mo., James Pollard, a
young farmer, was drowned while
trying to ford a usually small rivulet,
which had been changed to a swift
torrent by the heavy rain.
In Eastern Kansas nearly three
inches of rain fell at Ottawa, Con
cordia, Elsmere and other points,
causing the Marmaton, the Big Creek
and Mais des Cygnes rivers to over
flow. Several bridges were washed
out, crops submerged and much other
damage done.
At Ellis, Kansas, a cold, driving
rainstorm prevailed, followed by a
strong wind and heavy fall of snow.
In the vicinity of Winona and Oakley,
Kansas, over 200 telegraph poles were
blown down.

While the main driveway in Golden
Gate Park was crowded with vehicles
yesterday afternoon a horse driven by
T. Van Stein ran away and caused in
jury to several people. Mrs. Eddie Gra
ney, wife of the well-known referee,
who was riding horseback, was thrown
to the ground. The animal on which
she was mounted was badly injured.
Van Stein and a lady who accompanied
him were pitched to the roadway, but
escaped with slight bruises. T. H.
Brown, a pedestrian, was also knocked
down, but not badly injured.
Van Stein and his companion had
started to drive from th'e boathouse
when the animal became unmanagable.
The driver did his' best to remain in
the road, and for a time succeeded in
doing so. Narrowly missing other ve
hicles, the maddened animal dashed
along and it seems a miracle that fa
talities did not result. When the run
away horse reached the main. drive
way Van Stein turned him in the direc
tion of the city and the dash con
tinued among the many carriages and
buggies that were on the road. The
excitement was intense for a time and
mounted police followed in an attempt
to gain control of the horse.
The runaway had gone but a short
distance on the main driveway when he
collided with a saddle horse on which
was seated Mrs. Graney. The lady had
been unable to reach a place of safety
and the force of the collision knocked
her to the ground. Her horse, which is
a valuable one. was severely cut and in
jured. Mrs. Graney refused to go to
the hospital and was removed to her
home. At this time Van Stein's ve
hicle was overturned and both its oc
cupants were, tossed out. A moment
later the horse swung into the bicycle
path and knocked down Mr. Brown,
who was on foot. Brown,, like the oth
ers, refused the attention of the hospi
tal' surgeons and went- to his home.
The horse was captured soon afterward
and returned to a stable on Mission
street, from which it had been hired.
The buggy was a wreck.
It is generally understood that sev
eral new divisions will be created in the
northern part of the State, one of
which will'include the two'small roads
recently acquired by the Southern Pa
cific and a proposed new connecting
branch between the California North
western a'nd the Napa division and an
other of the small branches . of the
Sacramento division, which is getting
too big for one man jj to. handle.. Of
course these. changes win not be made
for some time, but when that time
comes General , Manager Markham will
be prepared to submit a plan to Di
rector Kruttschnitt,' who is very famil
iar with the situation. It is reported
that the improvement of the roadway
of the California Northwestern will be
one of the first pieces of new, work or
dered by President i Harriman. Who
will assume charge of . the two coast
roads is a matter yet to , be decided
on by Director Kruttschnitt. It is com
mon talk in railroad circles, however,
that President Foster of : the, California
Northwestern is soon : to leave > on a
tri p to , Europe and ; during his absence
it , is. believed that whoever Is appointed
to take charge of the road will eventu
ally assume its' management "as well
a3 that of the North Shore and; carry
out any changes that may be suggested
by,. Director : Kruttschnitt. ' , , 1 ,?.-.
Before leaving his offices yesterday
the railroad magnate and several of
his officials, including Director of Main
tenance and Operations Kruttschnitt,
General Manager Markham and Man
ager Agler had a long conference, dur
ing which many changes in the operat
ing departments of the company, which
may result from the absorption of the
California Northwestern and the North
Shore roads and the compact entered
into between Harriman and Ripley,
were discussed. \
President E. H. Harriman of the
Southern. Pacific Company and his
party of New York financiers departed
yesterday for the East In their palatial
train. They left this city at 11:30

. LONDON. April 24.â The Stock Ex
change last week experienced a check
to the recent abnormal growth of con
fidence, mainly through the depression
on tho Parts bourse, which was caused
by Viceroy AlexiefTs desire to resign
his post In the Far East and by revela
tion that Russia's financial resources
for the carrying on of the war were
less extensive than had been reported.
Paris operators apparently interpreted
uhe action of Viceroy Alexieff. follow
* nS the death of Vice Admiral Mak
faroff, as a bad sign for Russian pros
pects In the Far East, and Russian
bonds suffered accordingly.
There even was talk among: finan
ciers of the possibility of AlexiefTs
disappearance from the theater of war,
paving the way for peace negotiations.

the constabulary- of the city again re
appeared upon the scene and this time
corralcd about fifteen men, including
all the attendants, gatekeepers, etc.
They were all hustled before Justice

bail each. Still they defied the author
ities and held the crowd at their re
sort. At 4:20 the third raid was head
ed by the Mayor and City Trustees and
once again a large number were hauled
before a Magistrate. Again they were
placed under $500 ball and given to un
derstand that if they were again
brought into court a very severe ball

ly defied the authorities of Sausalito.
Last Monday night the license hereto
fore enjoyed by the managers of the
resort was revoked and the place was
ordered closed. To-day a picnic was
on the programme and the park was
thrown open for a large number of
guests. The guests arrived, but soon
found that their day of pleasure was
to be disturbed. The authorities had
notified the proprietors of the fact that
they would not be permitted to sell
liquor or even to open the park to the
public. The managers then defied the
municipal officers, and not only opened
the park, but sold liquor, as well as
conducted other attractions contrary to
the new city ordinance.
As a result, when there were nearly
a thousand people on the grounds. City
Marshal Hannon with twelve deputies
appeared upon the scene and arrested
L. D. Schord and Charles E. Carl
son of San Francisco, as proprietors
of the park. The two men were taken
before Justice Prior and charged with
selling liquor without a license. They
pleaded not guilty and were placed
under J100 bail to appear next Mon
day. At that time Mayor Thomas was
present and informed the preprietors
that the. new ordinance passed would
not permit them to keep the park open
and that it must be closed within an
hour.

water has reached the office. The
wholesale district is completely sur
rounded and merchants are removing
their stocks of goods. All the railroads
are tied up, bridges being v threatened
and tracks covered. Washouts are re
ported in all directions. In the low
farming lands the water is from five to
ten feet deep, and much stock has been j
drowned and heavy damage to prop- j
erty caused. It is estimated that 300 j
persons are homeless. !
The storm is unprecedented in this ;
part of the State. The rain has fallen

FORT SCOTT, Kans., April 24.â Fort
Scott is experiencing the most serious
flood in its history. Marmaton River
and Mill Creek, which runs into the
former stream here, have risen ten feet
in the past twenty-four hours, the re
sult of heavy rains. Several hundred
persons have been rescued in boats. As
far as known to-night no lives have
been lost. The estimated loss in live
stock drowned and property damaged

The two streams began to rise at 10
o'clock last night, and to-day the city
was divided into three sections and al
most completely isolated. Normally
Mill Creek runs into the Marmaton
River northeast of the city, but be
cause of the rapid rise they formed a
new channel that cut across one end
of the city. To-night the entire north
ern part of the city is cut off arid part
of the city is inundated. Ten feet of
water is rushing through the streets In
that part of the city, and several hun
dred persons in what Is known as Bell
town have been forced to leave their
homes. Many were taken away in
boats.

from drowning. Late to-day an aged
couple named Lemore living a mile
north of the city near the river were
rescued in boats. They were completely
hemmed in. Rescuers were out all to
day under the direction of Fire Chief
Ausman. Mayor Congdon and Chief of
Police Mendenhall, and they succeeded
in saving thousands of dollars worth of
property, as well as the hundreds of
inhabitants of that district.

old watercourse. The' tornado passed
four miles east of Salina, wrecking tele
phone and telegraph poles and farm
property. Efforts made to follow the
course of the storm by telephone were
made, but all the wires are down.
It is a miracle that great damage was
not done at McPherson and many per
sons killed, as the tornado barely miss
ed the thickly settled residence district.

and strewn for hundreds of yards, and
Arnold and his wife and a young
woman visiting them were all painfully
injured. J. P. Castleberry was seriously
injured in the destruction of his house.
Trees, fences and wires were blown
down and other damage done. The path
of the storm was narrow and it passed
over quickly.
CENTRALJA. Mo., April 24.â A tor
nado struck near here to-night. Several
residences and- other , property were
damaged, but no one was killed as far
as reported.
McPHERSON, Kas., April 24.â A tor
nado struck McPherson this afternoon,
demolishing six residences and causing
other damage to property. Three per

damage was done in the country north

i A funnel-shaped ] cloud approached
the town from the south, following the
course of a ravine. The residence of
S. W. Rieff was first struck and the
house, barn and outbuildings destroy
ed. All the members of the family
escaped except a young man, who was
bruised and scratched. The "residence
of. Mrs. P. S. Fisher was next- struck.
The building was picked up and car
ried a considerable distance and de
molished. The family had seen the
approach of the storm and escaped. The
large Fisher apple orchard was ruined.

next in the path of the storm, was
wrecked and two of Brown's daughters
injured. One, struck by. the stove fall
ing on her, was seriously hurt. The
residence of Peter Sellberg was next
wrecked, the family escaping. After
wrecking the slaughter house of S. G.

About a week ago Juan Marron and
seven other Mexicans, while going up
a hill near the Treate Valley, met the
same man and were held up by him.
The Treate Valley is just beyond the
boundary line, east of Tia Juana. Dur
ing the three or four days between tnt
meetings the man had traveled close
to forty- five miles. The Mexicans who
were held up a week ago were simply
ordered to turn back. The man had a
small shoddy blanket, pieces of which
he had used on his feet to cover his
tracks. The Mexicans claim that he
has killed cattle belonging to the Mata-
Janal ranch and cured the meat with
out salt by drying it. He has no cook
ing utensils and had lived upon the
dried meat. It is claimed by some that
he has been in Lower California at
least a month.

MacHada met an armed man near
Guadaiupe and were fired upon by him.
Their assailant had two revolvers and

"Many of you have children," the
speaker said, "and you are .wondering
what to do with them when they grow
up. I'll tell you what to do with some
of them. See if you can detect in them
the germs of Christian brotherhood and
then give them over to the cause. No
man could aspire higher. The Christian
brothers are devoted body and soul, by
enthusiasm and vow to the cause' of
the young. They do not neglect their
secular obligations, but teach the high
est ideals . of Christianity. . They are
specialists in their line. This is the ace
of specialists and they know love and
loyalty and intellect."
The Archbishop Dointed out that the
social difficulties of the country are to
be solved only through the Christian
religion, and he referred to a recent
speech of President Wheeler of the uni
versity to support this idea. The cur
riculum of the university aa it now
stands will not solve our difficulties. It
needs something of Christianity in it.
And following out this idea the Arch
bishop said that the principle of the
purely secular school is wrong, because
it leads children away from the paths
of religion.

A solemn benediction by -Archbishop
BERKELEY. April 24.â With cere
monies that seemed strikingly simple
in contrast with the magnitude of the
enterprise, St. Joseph's Academy at
Peralta Park was dedicated to-day to
the cause of religious and secular learn
ing. Archbishop Montgomery officiated
in the grave ceremony of blessing the
imposing building and addressed the
people. This was all, but the signifi
cance of the ceremony was evident, and
"brief and simple as it seemed it carried
a message to the hearts of the great
crowd of men and women who assem
bled to see and hear.
The Archbishop first blessed the ex
terior of the building, in which cere
mony he was attended by a procession
of acolytes, priests and Christian
brothers In full regalia. Then the
chapel and interior of the building were
visited, the members of the procession
chanting while they marched. This
ceremony was followed by the address
of the Archbishop, who spoke from the
lower balcony of the hall, so many peo
ple being present that the chapel could
not contain more than half of them.
A NOBLE ORDER.
Archbishop Montgomery spoke of the
Christian brothers as being engaged in
a noble work, that of the secular and
religious training of the young. The
brothers, he said, had been established

In speaking of the book, Editor Hal

"We have tried to eliminate many of
the mean personal features that have
marked previous issues of the annual.
We had a large staff helping us, but
thÂ« work was bo divided that every
member was held responsible for a
certain portion of the work. The book
was divided into seventeen depart
ments. It was a big undertaking, and
we hope that it will meet with the ap
proval of the college community."

EDITOR GIVES VIEWS.
For the first time in the history of
the universitv the Affiliated Colleges
and the Mark Hopkins Institute of Art
have contributed liberally to the pages
of tbe annual. Separate departments
have been set aside for the medical
college, pharmacy.college and the Cal
ifornia School of Design, and the work
in these pages ranks with some of the
best that has been done by the Berke
ley people- .
The. cover of the book is done in a
rich blue leather with a panel of Cali
fornia poppies done in gold on the top
by Miss Florence Fisk of the junior
class. One of the striking features of
the annual is found on the fly leaves,
where the thumb nail snapshots of the
400 members are printed in blue and
gold.
To Professor Henry Morse Stephens
is accorded the â¢ honor of having the
cleverest Blue and Gold yet published
dedicated to him. The following is the
simple prefatory dedication:
"To Professor Henry Morse Stephens
we dedicate this book â in no spirit of
mere formality."
This is the first time in five years
that editor and manager of the Bluft
and Gold have succeeded in getting the
individual pictures of the sororities.
Hitherto pictures have'never been en
graved in such aÂ» way as to do the
young: ladies Justice. This time Man
ager Samuels has met their demands
by engraving the pictures in the most
thorough way known to the art. Be
sides thf> individual pictures of the
young ladies the book contains engrav
ings of every fraternity man and every
member of a house club in the univer
sity.
This talk of the superiority of the
book may well come under the head of
advertising, and the book may not jus
tify it all, but two things are certainâ
that it is to cost more and contain more
than any of its predecessors. Its covers
Inclose upward of 700 pages and about
1000 high-class half-tone engravings.
The students must take the editors'
word for it that It is the finest example
of the printer's art that a printer's
brain ever conceived.
Aside from the considerations of size
and artistic excellence there is another
phase of the book that will interest the
college community to an absorbing de
gree. One hundred and fifty pages of
the annual have been devoted to what
is known as a "Josh department."
Here Editor Hallett and his staff have
directed their shafts of ridicule at
many of the most important and digni
fied people of the university. No one,
from President Wheeler down to the
humblest freshman, has escaped the
undergraduate sallies. This depart
ment contains many clever caricatures
of those in high places.
ALL ARE GATHERED.
The '05 Blue and Gold editors an
nounced to-day that the book upon
which they have labored for two yeara
will be issued from the bookstores on
Wednesday. The event will be awaited
with particular enthusiasm, as the
editor, Eugene R. Hallett. and the busi
ness manager, Mervyn J. Samuels, have
been savins' up for a long time, and it
is said they have eclipsed anything
ever attempted by an American uni
versity.

been about {50,000. Mr. Snyder has
lately transferred a lot on Telegraph

ern appliances. The sale was made
through the office of Taylor Bros. &

"What do you mean by striking me
like that?" but the only answer was a
renewal of the attack, the man felling
her to the ground once more. As the
victim gained her feet a second time
she ran screaming to her mother-in
law's home. When she reached the
d>or the man turned and walked rapid
ly toward Broadway, disappearing iu
the darkness. Mrs. Denise found hsr
daughtor-in-law in a faint on the door
step and after learning the cause of the
trouble notified the police.
Mrs. Burns describes her assailant as
a boyish looking fellow between 19 and
22 years of age, veering a lisrl}t hat
and a dark suit of clothes. The police
were unuble to find any trace of the
man.
ALAMEDA, April 24.â Mrs. W. F.
liurns of 2617 Santa Clara avenue was
attacked and severely beaten by an un
known man this evening while on her
v.ay home from the Park-street broad
paupe station. Her assailant, after
striking her several times and knocking
her down twice made his escape. Mrs.
Burns does not think that robbery was
the motive of the attack as she says
i hat the man made no attempt to se
ture her purse or other valuables and
made no demand for money. She pro
iesses to be at a. loss to understand the
reason for her assailant's action and
says that she never saw the man be
fore. The assault took place about 9
o'clock in front of a vacant lot on
Santa Clara avenue between Broadway
and Everett street, almost directly in
front of the home of Mrs. J. XI- Deniee,
Mrs. Burns' mother-in-law, where the
victim ran for help after making her
tsrape from the assailant.
Mrs. Burns had left the 8:45 broaJ
pauge train at Park street and was
walking home on Santa Clara avenut?.
As she passed the corner of Santa
CUn avenue and Everett strett
she noticed a man standing on
the corner, who, as she approached,
lighted a cigarette. Then he
turned and followed. overtaking
her about the middle of the block.
Without a word he sprang in front of
Mrs. Burns. As he did so he struck hor
a heavy blow, knocking her down and
saying as he did so "There now.". Mrs.
Burns struggled to her feet and asked.

- Alexander McDonald, a blacksmith
residing at 27 Chencry street, was
thrown out of a buggy at Twenty-sixth
and Castro streets yesterday. McDon
ald was on his way to his home, when
his horse took fright and ran away.
The man struck on his j back, re
ceiving injuries which necessitated
his removal to the City and County
Hospital, where he was treated for a
contused wound on the head with a
possible fracture of the skull.
Thrown From a Buggy.
After completing a very prolonged
toilet the tardy gentleman Â¦ leisurely
meandered on deck. There he was met
by Dr. Hobdy, the examining doctor.
An exchange of words followed, and
the doctor's arm shot out, landing a
doubled fist on the jugular of the Brit
isher.; Fortunately on his arising from
the deck, did not rush mat
ters and .the consequence was that
peace was soon restored."
Captain Warwick called on the Brit
ish Consul immediately, upon his ar
rival at Honolulu, but that official Bays
that the call was of ; a-,social
character. Warwick later explained
that ; he understood Â» the : time * for the
examination was after eight o'clock.
A small unpleasantness, in which
English and Kentucky blood was in
volved, furnished considerable excite
ment on board the America Maru as
she entered Honolulu on her last trip.
The affair looked, for a time, as if
serious war might ensue, but was for
tunately ended by a series of apologies.
The passengers of the vessel were,
on the day prior 1 to their entering the
harbor, notified that they would be ex
pected to appear on deck at 7:45 the
next morning to be examined by the
United States Marine Hospital Board
ing Surgeon.. At the appointed time
the deck was lined by many passen
gers, eager to be examined and allowed
to go ashore. One man failed to an
swer the roll. Captain A. W. Warwick
of the British army was that man*.
Eight o'clock arrived and still no
Warwick. A' steward's boy was sent
below to advise the Britisher of his
tardiness and to ask that he report on
deck as soon as possible. It is claimed
that Warwick made the remark that
he would not be hurried by any â â â
American and then proceeded to enioy
the luxuries of the Inevitable, tin
bath. :=. S Â¦Â¦Â¦'

General Ballington Booth of the Vol
unteers; of America, who is making a
short visit, to this city, - preached an
impressive sermon at the First Presby
terian Church last evening, illustrating
the great amount of good accomplished
by the institution he represents. The
service was attended, by members of
various churches throughout the city,
and it was a large, and^ihterested con
gregation that responded to the emi
nent^ evangelist's appeal for financial
aid in rendering assistance to the poor.
General Booth used for his text the
words, "The angel > of - his presence
saved them." In part. he said:
â¢Several years azo, .lehen the Volunteers of
America were first organized, we were sub
ject to a vast amount of unkind and sarcastic
criticism. We were criticised by the people,
by the churches and by the press. We were
looked upon as mercenaries.-' and it was the
popular opinion that the Institution would be
disorganized long before now.
We have worked- hard and conscientiously
these few years, and I think we have won a
great victory. The amount of good work we
have done and the relief we have - given Is
more than I can tell. \
"The angel of his' presence saved them."
and It was the angel of his presence that has
inspired us to do our utmost In this work.
Many of you think . that diamonds, expensive
dresses and homes are beautiful. You make
a grave error, for they are not beautiful.
There is nothing so beautiful as the divine
faith in the great Creator. *
' We, the members of this Institution, visit
dally the darkest sections of this and other
cities â sectionti that you. with your silk hats
and kid gloves, would shun. We make thoee
places our field for the reformation of souls
and -are guided and protected by his presence.
General Booth concluded his remarks
with several interesting anecdotes of
his experiences. A large offering was
received to aid the Volunteers' work. â¢
General Booth will speak this even

Church.

Eloquent tributes to the memory of
the late William G. Badger were
spoken yesterday afternoon at , the
meeting called in honor of the deceased
philanthropist at Golden Gate Hall. The
large audience included many whom
Mr. Badger had aided with friendly
counsel or more substantial assistance
in their start on the road to success.
His deep interest in young men and the
unselfish devotion that had led him to
give away a fortune in practical be
neficence formed the keynote of the ad
dresses! The members of Mr. Badger's
family were present. .
The Rev. J. S. Lee of St. James
Church read the Episcopal service for
the dead. Solos were beautifully ren
dered-by Miss Juliette Greehinger and
Mrs. Muhlner. Then William Metzner,
the merchant, one of. Mr. Badger's
"boys," who are glad to acknowledge
their debt to him, spoke in feeling
terms of his character and the value
of his work for the youth of San Fran
cisco* He said- in part:.
' No one who knew our friend would fail to
testify to the nobleness of his character and
the loyalty " of .his life â loyalty to God and
country and: the . Ideals of hlshtsfr manhood.
No boy on the streets was ever too poor or too
poorly dressed for a cheery word from him and
a hearty clasp of the hand. Tlure was noth
ing of the Mligrlous Pharisee about him, and
nothing- of the society man. He cared more for
the company of a few of his boys at his home
than any .other pleasure - the world held.

had Inspired . and helped, are scattered over
the Unifd States, and many are doing good

As to the presence for the first time
of men and women together on the
floor of a convention, it was an inter
esting fact â a fact that throttles a
time-honored belief â that it was the
men â the men, remember â who did
most of the talking. And if I thought
the men wouldn't hear it, 1 would
venture the opinion that only a few of
them talked to the point under dis
cussion, not to mention that some of
them said some rather stupid things â
almost as bad as we women could
have done. But at any rate they
possessed the virtue of being in
earnest â that's something.

was begun by a woman. Miss Anna B.

Mrs. Caroline Rickey Olney (who was
elected secretary of the executive
committee), and it is fostered by the

clubs. Now, friends, let us as good
clubwomen and consistent Califor

work for the success of the great

Weddings.
In the Schwab party is Joseph
Schwab, father of the steel magnate:
Count Mercorder of Pittsburg, a civil
engineer, who has been employed by
Schwab for several years; J. C. Nevin.
a young mining engineer; Dr. Ward,
who long ago abandoned the practice
of medicine for the more lucrative pur
suit of a broker; Dr. S. A. Brown of
New York, surgeon of the party; John
McKane, superintendent of the Tono
pah properties and a life-long friend of
the magnate, and several ladies, includ
ing Mrs. Charles M. Schwab and Mrs.
Ward, who have been In this city for a
week awaiting the arrival from Ne
vada of the men of. the party.
Regarding these mining properties
Dr. Ward Â¦ said yesterday that Mr.
Schwab was well satisfied with his in
vestments, especially with the Tono
pah Extension; and was confident that
all the mines would prove dividend
payers.
"We made a trip over a part of the
Tonopah Railroad," which is now in
course of construction," said Dr. .Ward,
"and we viewed this enterprise in the
light of a splendid undertaking, that
will greatly benefit Tonopali in its pres
ent isolated position. It is a country
in which a railroad is needed, , a fact
that was readily appreciated by those
who control the Tonopah Mining Com
pany and the new railroad line."
Dr. Ward denied that Mr. Schwab is
interested in the newly incorporated
Pacinc Steel Company of San Diego,
and added that aside from his desire to
look over his Nevada properties his
trip to this State is merely for pleasure.
The magnate has invested a large
sum in the Tonopah camp, and with
Robert C. C. Hall and W. F. Corey
of the United States Steel Corpora
tion, Dr. Ward, Richard Brown and
others he has incorporated several
companies, among them the Tono"pah
Extension, Golden Anchor, Bob Tail,
Menvur Group and Red Rock, upon
which it is purposed to expend a great
deal of money in development.

MAGNATE SEES CITY.
Mr. Schwab spent the greater part of
yesterday viewing the sights of San
Francisco. He returned to his tempor
ary abode at the St. Francis. Hotel well
pleased with his day's outing.
"You have a beautiful city and a
magnificent park," he remarked,,, "and
there Is evidence on all sides that
quickly Impresses a visitor with the
fact that a bright future' is in - store
for the metropolis of the West. Butâ"
and Mr. Sshwab spoke rather hesitat
ingly â "your streets- are not-' the best
that I have seen during my travels."
Â¦ "Mr. Schwab is of course judging
your thoroughfares from an automo
bilist's point of view," Interposed -Dr.
R..M. Ward, brother-in-law of.* the
millionaire, who generally speaks for
his relative. Â¦ "The streets can indeed
be improved, but aside from this bad
feature we are all generally pleased
with our visit, and none more so than
Mr. Schwab."
This is Millionaire Schwab's first
visit to San Francisco, but it is prob
able that the* city will soon see him
again, for he has valuable interests
at Tonopah which are likely to bring
him to the West frequently, and he
expects to come as far as San Fran
cisco on these occasions.
Charles M. . Schwab, the Pittsburg
steer magnate, has shown that there is
a strong touch of human affection : in
his makeup. Though he Is in Califor
nia for pleasure, withj^an elaborate pro
gramme of sight-seeing, he is so deep
ly grieved over the serious illness of. a
favorite valet that . a pall has fallen
over his*days and his nights are full of
anxiety. But for the great inconve
nience \t would cause to others of his
party there is little doubt that he woul^
abandon .his pleasure tour during the
illness of his faithful attendant.
Shortly after arriving at Reno Mr.
Schwab's valet, Charles' Lee, a man
who had been with the millionaire for
nearly ten years, was suddenly strick
en down and had to be left behind while
the party went into the Tonopah camp.
On returning 1 the valet's condition was
found to be very serious, and his em
ployer ordered that he be hurried to
this city for proper medical treatment.
Arriving here with the party Saturday
night, the unfortunate man was'imme
diately sent to the Adler Sanatorium,
where an operation was performed yes
terday with unsatisfactory results.. In
fact, Lee's life is now ebbing, a piece
of news that was conveyed: to Mr.
Schwab yesterday and caused him no
small amount of anxiety. He is very
fond of his servant and has given or
ders that every effort be exerted to
save his life. It was anxiety that
prompted the millionaire to delay a trip
into the Yosemite Valley, on which he
was to have started to-day. It is the
intention of the party to spend several
days in the valley and then return to
this city, where the travelers will em
bark on their homeward journey.
i The engagement reception of Miss
Eva Abrams and Jack Jacobs will be
held Sunday, May 1, at 38 Grove street,

whose extraordinary personality makes
him interesting even to beholders, and
t* ho sent forth some Emersonian
dogmas in support of sentiment, which,
o? course, figures largely in the matter
of Camin^ Real. It was he. by the

besought the convention to eliminate,
the "Ei" from the title of the new as-

whom Spanish is a variable quantity,
insist upon saj-ing ''the EI Camino

Whatever misgivings were enter

from the central coast counties and
from the south were dissipated during

which was occupied temporarily by A.
P. Fleming of Los Angeles, and in the
meeting of delegates on the floor. Be
lieve me when 1 say that the love feast

of geographical compliments. That the
compliments must have been geograph

deduction from the fact that our ac

The definite results of the delibera
tions in the old mission town were an
agreement as to the practicability and
utility of the proposed rehabilitation of
the Camino Real, proof of the absolute
necessity of good roads to rural busi

ity of keeping to the present roadways
as far as possible â for in the main they
are remnants of the famous old high

Now has the Board of Education
gone into the work of "compelling edu
cation" in right good earnest, and the
clubwomen, likewise all women and all
humanitarians, applaud the energetic
efforts of the leaders of the two arms
of our educational service. On with the
good work! Likewise that of cleansing
the schools and rendering them more
sanitary. Also the medical examina
tion of pupils. All these innovations
arc in the int'.-rests of physical perfec
tion, which, we all concede, must go
hand in hard with mental and moral
development
President Roncovierl and Superin
tendent Langdon, our congratulations!
Long have the n^cmbers of the social
science section of the California Club;
likewise the settlement workers and
others of us whose business lies partly
beyond our own doorsteps, known that
hundreds of little tykes, boys and girls
alike, were being deprived of the birth
right vouchsafed to them by the State
of a public school education. Some of
them have been deprived of it through
economic conditions â and for shame!
For shame that children, brought into
the world unsolicited, should be turned
adrift in their babyhood years to pro
vide bread for their puny bodiesâ and
for the bodies of brothers and sisters
whom an unreasoning nature thrusts
forth without reason or necessity! We
have all known this ever since we
learned to think. We also know that
many children are not availing them
selves of schoolwork because of the
apathy or disability of parents. In the
Latin quarter this is largely true.
The subject under discussion at the
April social of the Pacific Coast
Women's Press Association at Century
Hall, this afternoon, will be the pro
jected magazine. Music will be fur

choir. Mrs. C. O. Southard will relate
some experiences of a magazine edi
tor. Miss Ruth Comfort .Mitchell will
contribute a story; Miss Coolbrith and
Mrs. Grace Hibbard, magazine verss,
and Miss Gail Laughlin an informal
talk. Then will come a free discussion
on the subject of the magazine. Rep
resentatives of the press and all inter
eEted in magazine work are invited to
be present.
The Sorosis Club has also arranged
to breakfast together. On" Monday
next, at the St. Francis, a distinguished
array of Sorosis ladies will tell a few
good stories and propose a few clever
toasts while they dispose of Mr. Pol
lock's delicacies. . .
Now, these annual breakfasts are
notable feasts â not only of edibles, but
of thinkables and laughables as well.
On Wednesday the Forum Club will
elect its officers, but nothing interest
ing: will occur, as there is no opposition
ticket. That's distinctly dull, ladies!
On Saturday, the 30th, the annual
club breakfast will be given at its club
rooms.
The Chonian Club of Alameda is en

she holds a reputation for exquisite

Mrs. Joseph R. Knowland has been

TO-DAY, in the hands of some two thousand car
men, rests the immediate peace of this municipality.
These two thousand men are to determine whether
cur city transportation facilities shall be disorganized; they
are to determine whether or not San Francisco may be
made the scene of riot and bloodshed or continue a city of
peaceful and well ordered prosperity. Upon the ballots'
of a majority of them is involved, on one side, grave
public inconvenience, serious loss to the merchants. and,
with it all, the reputation of the city. On the other side
is involved the integrity of the union and the possible
loss of a very high wage scale. 1
The carmen should make no mistake. The offer made
by the company, in view of all the circumstances, seems
fair, and there will be no popular sympathy with a strike.
Two years ago the public supported Â»the carmen and the
carmen won. They must not deceive themselves into
believing they could have succeeded anyhow â and they
must not mislead themselves into believing .'they can win
now without public support. If the carmen make a mis
take it may prove fatal. At the best it will, prove
disastrous. The city looks to the members of the union
to act wisely and for the common good. Let us have
no strike. , ,

The' events which marked the out*
break of hostilities between Japan and
Russia have drawn considerable atten
tion to the torpedo as an engine of
war. For years past we have heard
a lot about "the man behind the gun."
but the Japanese have shown us that
"the man behind the torpedo" may
now be regarded as an equally im
portant factor when it comes to a
fight. Much has be,en said both for
and against this weapon, and open
doubts have been expressed, by naval
men, too, as to its usefulness. The
Japanese have dispelled this once and
for all. The part played by the tor
pedo at Port Arthur gives additional
interest to experiments now being car
ried on with this weapon by the Brit
ish naval authorities. Already they
have resulted in some improvements
being effected. The latest fourteen
inch torpedo, which is going: to the
battleship Prince of Wales and other
new. ships, will run for 3000 yards at
a speed of thirty knots per hour. This
is a very great advance upon any
thing that has preceded it, but it does
not mark the limit of progress. Work
is now proceeding upon an improved
form of the eighteen-inch torpedo, and
it is fully anticipated that it will have
a range of 4000 yards. With this
weapon comes a revolutionary phase
in fnaval warfare, in which first place
must be given to the torpedo man. It
is difficult for any one who has not
some knowledge of the subject to re
alize what It will be for a captain of
a ship to have at his command a ma
chine that is capable of traveling a
distance of over three miles in four or

to sink the biggest battleship afloat.

"How did your mother treat your
father?" asked the court of each of the
little ones in turn.
"She was good to him," said the eld
est, a girl about 11 years of age. The
other three made exactly the same an
swer. This made Judge Graham sus
picious and he took the small witnesses,
one at a time, aside and questioned
them closely. He learned from their
baby Iids that for several days prior
to the hearing their mother had been
coaching them, filling their little minds
with lies they were to tell the Judge.
The father was given the decree of di
vorce and the custody of the children.
Little children make good witnesses
as a rule, for they are naturally truth
ful, and when placed on the witness
stand are in such fear of the court and
the strange surroundings that, even if
they are inclined to lie, they are afraid
to do so. Occasionally, however, a
child is found that, though willing to
tell the truth, has been coached so that
It is hard for the court to determine
whether the testimony is true or un
true.
Recently in Judge Graham's - court
during the hearing of a divbrce action
the four young children of the un
happy litigants were .witnesses. The lit
tle ones all told the same tale, telling
the court with remarkable glibness
how their father had abused their
mother.

to the tradition that a line officer knows

the assumption that a four years'

knowledge enabling him to become an
expert in any one of the various en
prineering branches he might be called
upon to take \iri at short notice. It is
true that a specialty has been made of
r.aval construction, but marine en
gineering, which up to 1S99 was a spe
cialty, is now a part of the line officer's
vade m(H?um. KITorts to broaden the
line officer in general knowledge are
likely "to spread him out too thin," as
the rhairman of the Naval Committee
remarked during the course of the
hearing regarding the personnel bill in
1SSS. The recent frequent accidents to
guns, cither by bursting, caused by
defective material or faulty design, or
premature explosions through improper
handling, would indicate the necessity
for a specially educated and trained
of ordnance officers, and the re
cently retired chief of bureau, Charles
O'Neil. strongly recommends it.
Upward of 1300 guns of all calibers
have been manufactured at the "Wash
ington gun foundry during the past
twenty years, and the results have un
til recently been highly satisfactory.
This was Probably due 'to the fact that
earlier guns were made on models of
the best ordnance in other navies and
that carefully selected material was
used. The ordnance bureau officers
were cautious and content with slow
progress in this new business, but
ready to adopt such improvements as
had been tested and found safe and
I ractica.1 by other gun manufacturers.
The officers charged with the construc
tion of guns were selected for their fit
ness for such work, and the inspection
<Â»f material in the shops was rigid. The
present unsatisfactory condition of our
naval ordnance is due to a variety of
causes, namely, lack of a sufficient
number of trained ordnance experts,
ambition of theorists to produce guns
1'ttter than those of other navies, su
perficial inspection of material and the
introduction of a new powder, the qual
ities of which seem to puzzle the ex
perts. Since 1S81 there have been four
Â« hiefs of the ordnance bureau, as fol
lows: Sicard, up to 1890; succeeded by
Folger, up to 1R93; then Sampson, up
to 1837. and finally O'Xeil, up to March
last. In the gun foundry over one hun
dred officers have been employed since
1SS4, which with a yearly force of
eleven officers gives an average of
about two years' service to each officer
at the gun foundry- At the bureau,
v.hore the designs are made for guns,
mounts, gun shields and other details
pertaining to ordnance matters, no less
than fifty officers have found a two
scars' retreat after the usual cruise at
nca or to break up the monotony of
other less congenial shore duty. At the
proving grounds and torpedo station
the same average of two years holds
pood. Of course, a number of officers
have had from four to seven years"
â¢â¢rdnance duty, but only a few of these
experts are left, and there are- probably
not over twenty bona fide ordnance ex
perts from which to select a corps of
ordnance officers, of which the navy is
eadly in need.
The organization of an ordnance
corps would not alone be beneficial to
the service, but quite in consonance
with the personnel law of 1899 by which
former engineer officers, now classed
as line officers, are carried along and
promoted, without performing any sea
eervice, after reaching the grade of
commander. An ordnance corps to
perform shore duty alone would be no
departure from the present practice
of employment and promotion of offi
cers.

BY the' recent publication of the annual report of
the Boston Board of Overseers of the Poor a good
deal of interesting information is ; given on some
of the social problems of that city and incidentally the
fact is disclosed that the problem of the poor in the
United States is not so complex but what it may be vir
tually . solved if due attention be given to it in a spirit
â¢sympathetic but not sentimental, so that there will be
no error either on the side of indifference to the needs
of deserving people Who are in distress or "of overgen
erosity to the undeserving who habitually prey upon both
public and private chanty.
The most notable feature of the report as presented in
a summary given by the Boston Transcript is contained
in the statement: I
"While the population of Boston has increased in the
last twenty, years from 379,129 to 607,697, an increase of
228,568 persons, the number of families aided by the
Overseers has actually decreased from 4075 to 2346, a de
crease of 1729 families. In the same period the average
cost per family has increased from $1693 per family to
$2992 per family; the amount of aid given directly to
the poor in 1002 being $72)408 34 to 2420 families, while
the amount so given in 1883 was $68,98909 to 4075
families." .
These figures showing a* remarkable decrease in the
number of families receiving aid from the -city, while at
the same time there is an increase in the amount of
money granted for aid, is said to be due to the fact that
the Overseers are now giving closer attention to their
duties than formerly. The result is the city is no longer
granting money to families that do not deserve it, and as
a consequence is able to give more effective aid to those
Another interesting feature of the report is the show
ing made of the work of The Wayfarers' Lodge, an in
stitution where tramps are taken care of. The lodge is
open until midnight throughout the year and all appli
cants, for lodging arc received. In former years it was
the custom to limit the number of consecutive lodgings
to three for each man, but the rule worked badly, for
it enabled habitual tramps to solicit money for lodgings
on the ground that having been three consecutive nights
at the lodge they would not be, received there again.
Each applicant is given a bath, a bed and a breakfast, be
ing required to do two hours' work at wood sawing in
return. P3it-
Efforts are made to get work for all who desire it,
but in many cases it is clear there is no desire of that
kind on the part of the applicant for lodging. The re
port says: "We try to do something to help the appli
cant to a better life. Suggestions of places where he
can apply for work are often made and encouragement
is given to apply at the Industrial Aid Society across
the street for work. We are able to influence but a
small proportion to make any effort to help themselves/'
The solution of the tramp problem it seems will have
to be effected by something in the nature of compulsory
work or at least upon a policy of no work no food. The
Boston Overseers say: "Tramping as an evil, as a disease
of the body politic, would entirely disappear were it pos
sible to apply the work test in every city and town of
the country. Wherever it has been tried it has proved
most efficacious, but most communities consider the ex
pense of applying it too great. It would seem as if
groups of small towns could combine together and main
tain a tramp-house with a work test, sharing the ex
pense in proportion to the valuation or population of the
respective towns. In this way the expense would not
bear too hard on any one town."
The course of prices in the San Francisco market, as
in the East, is toward a lower plane of values. During
the past week lower quotations were established for
wheat, barley, prunes, hams, bacon, lard, hay and a num
ber of minor products. Some feedstuffs were scarce and
liighei. The general trade of the port was active, and
continued rains, particularly / in the south, .further im
proved the crop prospects, which are now fine. There is
nothing wrong with trade in California thus far..*
The exhibit of exports and imports during March is
not as unfavorable as one might expect from the gen
eral tendency of business toward quieter times. The
March statement of imports and exports of merchandise
showed a balance in favor of the United States of $28,
511,235, or about $7,000,000 less than for the same month
in 003, and a falling off as compared with the preceding
month of about $1,500,000. The balance of trade in our
favor for the nine months ended March 31 amounts to
$422,297,000, being $85,213,000 more than in the same
period in 1003 and $20,000,000 in excess of the correspond
ing period in 1902. The total for the nine months is the
largest since 1901, when exports for the same period ex
ceeded imports by $540,241,953. The point in this state
ment is that while our foreign trade for a period of al
most a year shows a gain there has been a marked falling
off this spring.
Reports from New York show a quiet and low money
market, with abundance of funds and a dull and listless
stock market. A favorable feature is that the exports
of gold from New York to Europe are more. than offset
by imports of gold from Japan at San Francisco. Another
encouraging feature is that the Bank of England has
again reduced its rate of discount to 3 per cent, the sec
ond reduction thus far this month, indicating that money
is easy in England.* With plenty of money in London
and New York the commercial situation may.be consid
ered safe, even though the. demand for merchandise
shows a decrease. Â«'.-Â¦Â¦ .
THERE was little change in trade conditions ;last
week, but the general tendency was toward in
creasing stocks of merchandise and slowly declin
ing prices. Bad weather was reported from all over the
country, the temperature being low and the ground sur
charged with moisture. The weather feature was the
most serious, as it continued to retard even, the regular
trade. The cold checked the distributive demand for
spring goods and the growth of wheat and other vegeta
tion and the excessive moisture prevented the farmers
in many parts of the country from working in their fields.
All these circumstances combine to cut down the volume
of trade.
There is another factor diminishing the volume . of
trade and that 'is the approach of the Presidential elec
tion. Presidential years are always quieter than others.
As the year advances we may look for an increase rather
than a decrease in this retarding influence, so the pros
pects for an active year in trade are not bright. Political
transitions are so apt. to produce such wide changes in
the financial, tariff and industrial conditions of the
nation that large interests are not disposed to operate
while great issues are pending.
As already mentioned, stocks of many commodities
are increasing without a corresponding demand, and this
tends to depreciate quotations. A significant movement
in this direction is the threatened closing down of the
silk factories in New Jersey and Pennsylvania owing to
lack of orders for" fall delivery. The manufacturers are
considering a proposition to close down the mills from
May until September unless. ..business improves. There
are not orders enough on hand to keep the mills going
after the middle of May. and what is significant, the de
mand for the high-priced fabrics is disappearing. About
a year ago attention was called to the heavy demand for
expensive fabrics, as showing the great prosperity of the
country, and a shifting of the demand to goods of cheaper
quality and a falling off in the inquiry for even these is
significant as showing which way the current of domestic
expenditures is running. Economy is now being prac
ticed by women even in the matter of dress.
The other staples show similar conditions. Stocks of
provisions continue large and the movement seems to
be slowly falling off. Iron and steel, while not materially
quieter, are certainly no more active than for the past
few weeks. During the early part of the month the
movement showed some signs of expansion, but it proved
merely temporary, and after a week or two ceased. The
industry seems to be on a sound basis, however, though
few orders for delivery after July I are being received.
A few j'ears ago orders for delivery a year in advance
were common and no order could be filled within less
than six months. This, like the decreased demand for
fine silk fabrics, is significant. Raw wool is reported
quieter, with the manufacturers buying slowly and
cautiously.
Hides and leather are quiet and lacking in snap in most
markets, while reports from the New England shoe fac
tories do not indicate any rush in this industry. . The
tendency in the important 'farm staples, such as wheat,
corn, etc., is rather toward lower prices. The prospects
for wheat are not as bright as they were some weeks
ago, the cold, wet weather having retarded the growth of
winter wheat, and copious rains and muddy fields are
interfering more or less with plowing and seeding for
spring wheat in different parts of the Northwest. The
demand for both wheat and flour continues poor. Ex
porters who have lately cabled offerings to the continent
have received the curt answer that Europe does not want
American wheat. 'This is affirmed by the showing of the
current exports, which were 1.645,400 bushels last week,
against 3,885.000 during the corresponding week last year,
and by the statement of a large Minneapolis miller a few
days ago that it seemed impossible to sell flour anywhere
on earth.
Railroad earnings also reflect the tendency of the
times. The Western roads are reporting .a decreased
movement in freight, and though passenger traffic con
tinues heavy the earnings of all roads thus far in April
arc 4.5 per cent below those for the corresponding period
in 1903. The feature of the bankclearings last week was
the decrease in all the important cities, pnly two â New
Orleans and Cleveland â exhibiting a gain over last year.
The loss at New York was 13.3 percent, at Chicago 29.4
per cent and at Pittsburg 24.4 per cent, these three cities
being the centers respectively of financial and stocK
operations, grain and provision speculation and iron arid
steel' production. The failures record, however, made a
good showing, numbering 241, against 266 last year.
BOSTON'S PUBLIC CHARITY.
In the German navy the retired pay
of officers is graded according to the
length of service of . the beneficiary,
and starting with 25 per cent of the
full pay after ten years entry In the
service terminates with 75 per cent of
full pay at the end of forty years' ser
vice. Special retired pay is allowed to
grades above commodores. The latter's
full pay is 9354 marks, or about $2340
a year; captains -receive $1750; com
manders, $1340; lieutenant command
ers. $1040; lieutenants, $640, and junior
lieutenants, $487. It is "evident" from
this low rate of pay, as compared with
that in the British and American
navies, that salary offers no induce
ment to become an officer in the Ger
man navy, and that such positions
are only for the nobility and other
persons who have sufficient means of
support without counting upon that
received for serving the country. Petty
officers of the first class in the United
States navy receive from $432 to' $780

The French protected cruiser Cas
sard,'while on her twenty- four hours'
trial trip off Toulon last month ran on
the rocks, damaging her bottom, carry
ing away bilge keels and twisting two
of her propeller blades. The vessel got
off, however, without assistance and
steamed to the dockyard, where the
requisite repairs will detain her at least
two months. ';- â¢
The British cruiser Flora, which ran
on the rocks in British Columbia wat
ers last December and was saved with
some difficulty., has been repaired and
left Esquimau April ready for future
service. The dockyard authorities con
cede that but for the fact that the
cruiser's bottom was wood sheathed,
the vessel would have become a total
loss.
The old Belleisle, a coast-defense
ship of 4870 tons, purchased from Tur
key in 1878, is another vessel to be sold.
The only service rendered by the
Belleisle has been that of a target foi
gunnery and torpedo practice during
the Â»ast three years, and the hull is
now so thoroughly battered as to be of
no further use except to go on the iron
scrap pile. The two-decked screw ships
of the line, Edgar and Hannibal, of 91
guns, built in 1S58 and 1S54, are relics
of the past and have been utilized for
forty years as depot ships and hulks.
The sloops Daphne, Icarus and Swal
low, built in 1856-S, have likewise out
lived their usefulness, and eight gun
boats. Including Plassy and Assaye,
twin-screw torpedo gunboats, completes
the list of vessels to be sold.
Fifteen obsolete vessels are to be sold
out of the British navy, as no longer
serviceable for any purpose. The most
noteworthy of this lot is the Duke of
Wellington, a 131-gun screw line-of
battleship built at Portsmouth in 1852.
She is the sole remainder of the six
three deckers of that period, and of the
thirty-two-deckers, only one â the Vic
tor Emmanuel â still exists, serving as
guardship at Hongkong. The Duke of
Wellington had auxiliary screw engines
of 7S0 horsepower," giving the ship a
speed of 10.15 knots under favorable
conditions, and her complete cost, ex
clusive of armament, was JS5S.675. It
required the oak timber of twenty-six
acres and the labor of 334 shipwrights
for one year to build this ship. Her
complement was about 1100 men and
her annual expense of maintenance was
estimated at SU6.000. The enormous
draught of these three-deckersâ 35 to
26 feet â made them unsuited for general
work, and the only service rendered
by the Duke of Wellington was as flag
ship of Admiral Napier In the expe
dition against Bomarsund in 1654, In the
destruction of which, however, the flag
ship took no part. After Its return to
England the use of the Duke of Wel
lington has been limited to that of
guardship at Portsmouth, accommo
dating officers for the fleet and dock
yard reserves and other miscellaneous
purposes.
The five torpedo-boat destroyers, De
catur, Bainbridge, Barry, Chauncey
and Dale, which left Hampton Roads
December 13 last year for the Philip
pines, arrived at Cavfte April 15, thus
completing the trip of 18,000 miles in 123
days. It was estimated that the voy
age of 15,000 miles would take 151 days,
but weather and sea favored the flo
tilla and no stops were made except to
take in coal and other supplies. The
boats proved seaworthy, no accidents
happened to their machinery and the
vessels from all accounts will need but
slight overhauling and docking to fit
them for duty. The average speed, de
ducting the time in port, has been
about ten knots. The longest run was
from San Juan to the Canary Islands,
a distance of 2S73 miles, which was
made in twelve days on an average
daily coal consumption of eighteen
tons. The successful termination of
this long voyage well within the esti
mated time is creditable to the design
ers, builders and navigators, for while
they are not baby ' vessels â having a
full load displacement of 625 tons with
230 tons of coal aboardâ their frail con
struction as compared with ordinary
vessels of the same size has been com
mented upon as verging upon the lim
its of safety. That they have devel
oped no weakness goes to prove that
the science of modern construction is
all that is claimed for it and that good
material properly put together will give
better results than the ship and engine
constructions of twenty years ago.
of its members. In order to prevent a
life tenure of any members of the staff
pone are to remain longer than three
cr four years on such duty, and are not
to be eligible for reappolntment until
after the lapse of another four years.
The scheme looks practical and in the
interest of the welfare of the navy; the
board will exercise no authority, and
as it will assume the duties of the Bu
reau of Navigation in so far as relates
to the assignment of officers the plan
will probably be more acceptable than
the present system. Senator Hale is
said to be opposed to the naval staff
scheme and if it does become a law it
will be in such a form as to deprive it
of any Insidious attempt to usurp the
functions of the Secretary of the Navy.
A certain Judge who possesses a de
gree from a leading university dropped
in one day at a new thirst resort, partly
for the purpose of getting a drink and
incidentally to see >the decorations, of
the place. ; When the Judge entered one
of the barkeepers was discoursing to
a customer upon the beauty of a stain
ed glass window.
"Dat window," he said, "is de hand

Thomas McCue, a tailor residing at

and members of the A. P. A. society
are his born enemies, so he started
out on last Saturday afternoon in. the

to exterminate them. That no inno

menced; on the first person he met and

McCoy tell of the remarkable growth
of the society since its organization in
1844. when it was founded in London
by Sir George Williams. The speaker
described the work of the associations
in all' parts of the world. and dwelt
especially upon its efforts in behalf
of railway employes, soldiers, and
sailors, students in the colleges, â¢ and
the vast number of working youth
who are enabled by the night classes
maintained in every city to obtain
an education in I technical and other
lines, which, but for the work of tho
society, would be beyond their reach.
The address was illustrated with
handsome stereopticon views showing
many of the association buildings in
leading cities of the United States and
Canada. Mr. McCoy said that these
buildings represented a. value of >$ 30,
000,000. The - 1500 associations in
North America have' more than 350,

SECRETARY 3IcCOY RECOUNTS
ORGANIZATION'S GROWTH
From one end of Berkeley to the
othtr rapid progress is evident. Seen
from a distance the great number of
r.ew rooJs erive it the appearance of a
nc w community, and such it is in part.
As the seat of the University of Cali
fornia it has had from the inception
cf that institution peculiar interest for
the people of all portions of the State.
For a time its gTovvth was gradual, in
the past few years its advancement in
population and in everything that is
thereby implied has been and continuts
to be phenomenal.
The best informed citizens of Berke
ley cherish dreams of greatness for
their hvme city. Its educational facil
ities have for many years been the
magnet to draw the cultured from all
parts of the Pacific Coast as permanent
residents. Once settled in Berkeley for
the purpose of giving the children the
advantages held out by the free tu'
tion in the university and the f-xctl
leot teaching in the public school?,
heads of families have become attached
to the climate, scenery ar.d people.
This sort of accretion is assured as Jor.s:
as rtie university lasts and that will
bo for many years to come, probably
lor centuries.
Never underrating th<? university and
indeed looking to it with great and
pver increasing pride, seeing its con
stant growth and the ever widening
scope of its beneficial influence, the
Berkeley people have also disoernttl
other causes that are accessory to
greatness.
Seen in all its glory, seated on the
gentle slopes that give it great views
of the Golden Gate, of the broad ex
panse of the bay of San Francisco, of a
wide extent of water and charming
landscape, north, south and west,
Berkeley is always an agreeable mem
ory to visitors and constant delight to
thope who dwell within Its favored
boundaries. The refining influence of
education has been a factor in its ar
chitecture, in its home life, In its gen
eral environments.
MAYOR RICHARD'S VIEWS.
Mayor Thomas Rickard, head of the
local government of Berkeley, supplies
the following facts that indicate very
well the advance along lines of ma
terial progress:
Berkeley's growth In Indicated by the in
crteEe of. 400 school children in tbÂ» pa*"t year.
The total increase of the census for the laÂ«t
four yÂ»-*r *xee*ds 1200. bringing the cumbrr
of school census children up to 4250, an in
crease of over 30 per cent. This would In
dicate that our present population exceeds
21.000. which entitles us to rank as the sixth
city in the State.
In the IaÂ«t year our municipal government
hac macadamized, graded, curbed, guttered,
mewfrcd and culvertert eleven miles of new
Ftreetn. at a coÂ«t of $277,827. This Increases
the fity's total of macadamized thoroughfares
to 70 miles. In the loft year we have made
24, â¬10 llmal feet of new eewers. at a cost of
$19,313 70; COCO linrs.1 fr ; et of concrete cul
verts, at a cost of $10,572; 4SÂ»,S3S lineal feet of
cencret* sidewalks, at a cost of $.'{3,3)7 51.
j The city's total expenditure in the last yenr
J for thÂ«-Â«e street improvements aggregates
Â»341.OG! SO.
The spirit or progress is rife in the air In
the college town. The preliminary step* to
submit to the electors of the city a proposi
tion to issue bonds to the amount of S3l7,OO<i
for municipal Improvements have already beÂ«-n
taken. It i* planned to vote J45.O0O for wharf
end water-front improvement*; $75,000 for a
City Hall; $12S.uiK> for new zchooihouses;
$20,000 for a manual training department;
$::5.O00 for a fire department; $JO,l>00 for a
park; $7000 for the equipment of the stree;
I department, and $200,000 for a storm sewerag*
j system.
Berkeley has reached that stage of growth
which compels it to realize that it must begin
to build on large and deep foundations. The
sentiment of our people strongly favors the
perpetuity of Berkeley as an independent city.
The rapid increase of th* city's wealth may
j be reliod upon to yield the necessary income
to support the city's growing needs without
entailing burdensome taxation.
; The last year has witnessed great strides
I In the manufacturing interests on our water
front, and several enterprises are projected.
Involving large Investments, which will make
the western |>ortion of the town very impor
tant comraercally. With two transcontinental
linen and well-equipped water facilities, there
is no doubt of Berkeley's future in this di
rection.
The fctlmulating effect of the new ferry
service is felt throughout the community, and
the promise of great Improvements In the
nlder local bervice makes the future even
briahtor.
Famed for Its climate: blessed with the
grandest educational facilities In the world:
protected by the State's htcrn ordinances
against the liquor traffic. Berkeley in the
years to come will continue to draw to it
people of culture and wealth.
RICHARDS IS ENTHUSIASTIC.
Berkeley has a Board of Trade, of
which J. W. Richards is the president.
The purpose of this organization is to
disseminate information relative to
Berkeley. Some pamphlets have been
published by the Berkeley Board of
Trade in which are embodied statistics
relating to the growth of the educa
tional city./but the progress has been
so rapid that these statistics are al
ready far out of the way, only half
telling the Berkeley story, although
they are but one year old. The fig
ures supplied by Mayor Rickard in the
foregoing are up to date. President
Richards of the Board of Trade is
found to be no less enthusiastic than
Berkeley's Mayor on the subject of the
future. He says:
What will happen In Berkeley In the next
few years will amaze the people of Berkeley
as well as those in all of California. The
western portion of this city will become a
great center of ; manufacturing. The room is
there and all the conditions are favorable. It
Is 'near San ' Francisco by water, and the
wharves that will be run out Into the bay will
accommodate ' the shipping necessary to carry
oo trade and commerce. On this side of the
bay will be situated great grain elevators.
The recend transcontinental road to pass
through Berkeley will soon be running regu
larly and affording us added facilities for
transportation 1 and for reaching market with
our manufactured products.
Our new high Eehool. when it was built,
was supposed to be large enough to accom
modate all the children for a long time. Hut
thrre clas.'es have been graduated. from this high
fcchool and already it is not large enough for
the boys and glrla who are seeking admission
to it. It is crowded. We did not know how
fast BerkeÂ»ey would grow when the plans for
the school were made. No one then appre
ciated our rate of progress in the immediate
future. I am satisfied that our advancement
will be fo great that we shall be continually
surprised. It is illustrative that the rate of
increase In school census children in Berkeley
is more rapid than in any part of California,
The university is expanding. That which orig
inally drew the attention of people to Berkeley,
the university. 1* rapidly growing and widen
ing in all ways â in buildings, in breadth of edu
cation. We are expanding in all directions and
contracting in none. We are becoming a great
city with city ways and city aspirations. No
place around the bay has such good facilities
for transit to and from San .Francisco as
Berkeley has enjeyed since the opening of the
Key Route to travel.
IX CAREFUL REVIEW.
Victor J. Robertson, president of the
North Berkeley Improvement Club, one
of the strongest and most effective
agencies for improvement in Berkeley,
has prepared the following relating to
Berkeley, 'which will be read with care
and interest:
Berkeley embodies all the conditions re
quired for an ideal residence, educational,
busliKs$ and manufacturing community. The
city Is skirted on the east by graceful foot
hills that readily submit themselves to the
."skill of the landscape artict. They afford an
inspiring' (/utlook, unrivaled in variety and ex
tent, and proptrly treated from an artistic
viewpoint could be piade most attractive. The
rlevstions nhould bb approached by winding,
well-drained street*, so as to withstand the
heavy rains of winter, and the steepf-r slopes
should be terraced. The entire foothill sec
tion could thus be made not only accessible,
but slcturepQue ami particularly desirable for
rtsidence sites. It is regrettable that the
scenic effect has already been marred by the
crowding of houses on shallow lots. In defiance
of arrwarancrs. commercial advantage and the
comfort and right* of others. Every commu
nity should have the right to protect Itself
against *uch a cractlce.
Berkeley is making much progress in Im
proving and beautifying its streets. There are
now about Â«vvÂ«ntr miles of fine streets, and
these will In time be flanked by suitable trees;
care should be had In this work along the hill
sides, however, where view : and sunshine
should be prime considerations. In due course,
conduits should be provided in which to plate
electric w;ren, water pin^s and gas pines, in
order that ur.siyhtly poles may be removed
and tearing up finished streets avoided.
Berkeley r.s an educaticnal center has Just
prl<*e in the State University, destined to be
come one of the leading Institutions- of its kind
In the world. The public schools arc among
the best In the State, but the marvelous
growth In population has taxed to the utmest
school accommodations. More money la there
fore imperatively needed for additional school
sites and for fwveral larger and more modern
school structures. The voters must Bee to It
that the school work la not hampered for want
of means.
SOMH URGENT XEKDS.
The school course, strangely enough, does
not embrace manual technical education* and
Instruction in domestic science â now regarded
as necessary In all complete systems of edu
cation. The citizen* will be asked to vote
$20,000 In bond* In .September for the Introduc
tion of these uurful features into the eehool
course. ThÂ» cwt to the taxpayers on $1000
assessed valuation will be but 12 cents to pro
vide this means of teaching boys and girls to
be useful. ' Â¦ Â¦ .-,
The Berkeley Fire Department Is well or
ganized, willing, alert, prompt and efficient.
It Is greatly aided in fire fighting . by the
water pressure, which is ordinarily adequate
in most Beet ions. More modern apparatus is
required, however, and more certain and rapid
means of reaching fires. The. $35,000 asked for
this department will be well Employed. ; In
some sections larger water mains will be
necesnary, but there is no doubt these will be
provided. Email areas should be. purchased in
the southern and western sections of the city
and put aside, while land is comparatively
cheap, for playgrounds. â¢ etc. The university
grounds afford a most beautiful natural park,
eo that these email spaces will answer every
requirement.
The western part of Berkeley, ' bordering on
the bay. Is well adapted ' for manufacturing
sites. Car and ship may there be brought to
gether â fulfilling the conditions required by
manufacturers. The. â¢ value of the waterfront
bus been demonstrated timo and again on San
Francisco Bay, and Berkeley should not , let
pass the opportunity to stake out a claim on
her waterfront. Berkeley â¢ should vote the
$15,000 asked for the wharf, " and should also
eecure more waterfront. , It . !â¢ an invaluable
possession, moreover. With intelligent en
couragement, in this respect, the west end of
tho town has possibilities of development lit
tle dreanu-ii of by the most sanguine. It con
tains the germ of Berkeley's commercial
growth.
PUBLIC SPIRIT OF CITV.
The matchless climate and outlook of ISerke
ley. seconded by her transportation facilities,
have attracted a population numbering 20.000.
But much remains to be done to keep abreast
of rrepxing municipal noeds. There should be
intelligent, fair, tolerant tilscusMon of these
needs, in order that an unbiased verdict may
be had u:Â»on the bond iFRue to be presented
to the voters in September. Meantime sec
tional barriers must be overthrown and public
spirit and community pride awakened.* The
North Ucrkeiey Improvement Club, the Cen
tral Improvement Club and other civic bodies
are devotint their energies to the work, not
only of looking after the needs of their sev
eral sections, but of arousinjr public interest
in the city as a whole, in order that the ad
vance may be General toward that jtreater
Berkeley, which will in time spread Itself over
the lnvltlnar territory to the northward. It Is
a great tack, indeed, but It is a pleasant one,
and there will be no faltering.
Amonp: the needs of Berkeley, as'de
scribed by President Ricnards of the
Berkeley Board of Trade and also by
Secretary R. C. Staats, is a tourist
hotel. The last named gentleman has
come in constant contact with the peo
ple and conditions existing in Berkeley
by' reason of his connection with the
Berkeley Board of Trade.
"There is no question," said Mr.
Staats, "that our progress is more
rapid than it has ever been. Any one
has only to use his eyes to see that.
Much more can be done by the people
than they are doing to make the situa
tion ever better. Possibly the great
growth that has come to the city has
made it seem to some to be less neces
sary to exert themselves to the utmost,
but that is a mistaken view. Proud of
Berkeley we all are, and with good rea
son." :;"Â»â¢ .
Its Splendid Location, Rare Educatiqnal Facilities, Fine Residences, Climate and
Great Water Front for Factory Sites Make It Advance.
BERKELEY SCHOOLS AXD CHURCHES CHARACTERIZING A COMMUNITY WHERE HOME LIFE IS MADE AGREEABLE.
George E. Crothers, one of the trus
tees of the Stanford University, be
lieves that it is possible to provide for
a way to legally determine, within a
limited time, all questions that can
possibly be raised relating; to the valid
ity of issues of all municipal bonds and
that a great advantage would be de
rived by such early determination, as
it would' aid in marketing securities of
this cJass and also in insuring their
value for investment as against any
subsequent attack.
San Francisco has in view an issue
of about $18,000,000 in municipal bonds,
the proceeds from the sale of which
will be devoted to providing many pub
lic improvements. Already the legality
of the issue has been attacked. If this
attack should result in affirming the
regularity of the bonds still the decis
ion would go only to the particular
question or questions raised. New
questions and other suits could come
up for Judicial decision later, as thu
law is now. â¢
MR. CROTHERS' REASONS.
Mr. Crothers has in view the prepa
ration of a bill to be submitted to thu
California Legislature at its next reg
ular session for adoption. If the Leg
islature shall take favorable action th'.Â»
result will be, so thinks Mr. Crothers,
favorable to the public In several
ways. Mr. Crothers admitted yester
day that he will prepare a bill. Con
cerning the reasons therefor he said:
How can our new city bonds be made more
attractive to Investors ar.d sold at higher
prices? The one great bugbear of investors in
city and other public bonds is the ever pres
ent fear that there Is some hidden technical
defect in the proceedings leading up to their
issuance, which may be disclosed at any time
at the instance of the corporation or of any of
its citizens. In such event thÂ» municipality
is actually prohibited by law from meeting Its
moral obligations to the investor whose money
it has spent.
The statutory and constitutional provisions
governing the issuance of bonds and the in
curring of d;bts are drawn with a special view
to .prevent possible 'fraud &nd imposition upon
the municipality by Its own officials, but they
entirely ignore the equities of innocent credi
tors and the possible desire on the part of the
public to meet all moral obligation;. For ex
ample, instead of mflklne it a felony for city
officials to Incur obligations in any vear In
rxcesp of the revenues for that year, the law
provides that the Individuals who contract witr.
municipalities must run the risk of losing their
deferred payments by the wrongful incurring
of subsequent obllsatlons in excess of the
limit. Our new charter attempts to remedy
this particular abuse. When a public corpora
tion "desires to cancel an agreement it Is not
even allowed to rUurn the money received, as
any orivate or quasi-DUblic corporation would
be obllced to do.
The nroviaiens referred to are permanently
fixed in our* State constitution. The question
is how to absolutely assure purchasers of the
validity of the vast issues of bonds about to be
made without attempting to modify the laws
under which they are ifisu'fl. â¢
The present method of testing such bonds is
by h nrocecdinc on the part of a citizen at
tacking .the issue. This Is open to two objec
tions'. Ktrst; if it should subsequently be
shown that the proceeding was collusive, any
Judgment obtained would be set aside. Sec
ondly, It determines only those questions
raised and th* Judgment does not stop subse
quent attacks. The public is familiar with
Â¦ many instances of protracted litigation over
public bonds*, but few are aware of the great
number of bor.d I.vucr which have been de
clared void after the municipalities have re
ceived and spent t><e money of lnnocfnt pur
chasers.
Nothing short of a proceeding in the nature
of an action in rein. Eimilar to that which has
been In use wince the act -of I8SH for tV>> de
termination of the validity of irrigation dis
trict bonds, will fully satisfy the requirements.
That act is unueaal, but has been rspeatediy
KUMaln'd by our Supreme Court as well as by
the Federal courts.
The act provided that "The board of direct
or."* of an irrigation district â¢ â¢ â¢ may com
mence a special proceeding- in and by which
the proceedings of said board and of said dis
trict providing for and authorizing the issue
and sale of the bonds of said dis
trict, whether said bonds or any of
them have or have not then been 6old, may be
judicially examined, approved and confirmed."
Published notice of the proceedings is ad
drpswd In general terms to and is binding
upon all parties Interested in the proceeding.
"Every material statement of the petition not
Fpecifically controverted by the answer must,
for the purposes of said special proceeding, be
taken as true, and each person falling to an
swer the petition shall be deemed to admit as
true all the material statements of the peti
tion."
â¢ It was al.*o provided, among other things,
that "L'pon the hraiinc of such special proceed
ing the court .Â«hall have power and jurisdiction
to examine and determine the legality and va
lidity of and approve and confirm each and all
of the proceedings for the organization of said
district under the provisions of the said act
from and Including the petition for the organ
ization of the district and all other proceedings
which may affect the legality or validity of
paid bonds, and the order for the sale and the
sale thereof." â¢ ,
REMEDY IS SUGGESTED.
There Is no reason why a similar proceeding
should not be made available for the determina
tion of the validity of proceedings for the is
(â¢uance of bonds of all municipalities and other
public corporations. Such a proceeding
should provide for the determination of
the validity of all proceedings for the is
suance of such bonds before or after their sale,
as provided In the act quoted. This would en
able the city to make such sales of bonds as
necessary to go ahead with the contemplated
Improvements until the Legislature meets next
January. The proceeding could be instituted
and decided in about one month after the pas
sage of the necessary enabling act.
. By rendering municipal bonds more reputable
among careful Investors this city would reap
a rich reward In the form of higher selling
prices. Instead of being looked at askance by
executors, trustees, guardians and others to
whom absolute security is the first considera
tion and income only secondary, such bonds
would at once be preferred to all other forms
of securities. There are also moral elements
involved, which should receive consideration.
The public 6hould have a conscience, and, like
any. honest business man, should not depend
upon technicalities to escape moral obligations.
our constitution Should be so amended as to
permit municipalities, by â¢ vote of their citi
zens, to meet their moral obligations. This in
tself would add materally to the security of
investments in public bonds. â¢>

"For fifteen years," Kays a young I

fiom stomach, heart and liver trouble.
Kor the last ton years the suffering
tvas terrible; it would be impossible to
describe it. During the last three years
I had convulsions from which the only
relief was the use of morphine.
"I had Fcveral physicians:, nearly all
of whom advised me to stop drinking
tea and coffee, but as I could take only
liquid food? I felt I could not live with-
out coffee. I continued drinking it until
1 became almost Insane, my mind was
affected, "while my whole nervous sys-
tem was a complete wreck. I suffered j
day and night from thirst and as water >
would only make me rick I kept on
trying different drinks until a friend
asked me to try Postum Food Coffee.
"I did tÂ»o, but it was some time be-
fore I was benefited by the change, my
system was so filled with coffee poison.
It was not long, however, before I
could cat all kinds of foods and drink
all the cold water I wanted and which
my system demands. It is now eight
years I have drank nothing but Pos- -
turn for breakfast and supper and the
result has been that in place of being
an Invalid with my mind affected, I am
now etrong. sturdy, happy and healthy.
"I have a very delicate daughter who
has been greatly benefited by drinking
PoEtum. also a strong boy who would
rather go without food for his break-
fast than his Postum. So much de-
pends on the proper cookjng of Postum,
for unless it is boiled the proper length

THE FUTURE REVEALED,
THE PAST DISCLOSED.
THE PRESENT ANALYZED
BY LIVINGSTONE,
PROF. LIVINGSTONE'S* readings are like
a living page of Flammarion's treatises that
Is so electrifying the world to-day. HE IS
NO IMITATOR. His work is upon original
lines; PURE THOUGHT. CLEAR VISION.
He TELLS YOU WHAT YOU DESIRE TO
KNOW. AND WORKS, IN. THE OPEN-
LIGHT. AND IS AS /ONSPICUOUS FOR
JTS WONDERFUL OCCULT ANALYSIS AS
IT IS FOR ITS ORIGINAL EXPRESSION
AND VIVID TRUTHFULNESS.
A test reading Is not a life reading. When
you call on PROF. LIVINGSTON U he will
give you a full life reading for $1. A test Ik
of little: value when the mind Is troubled â
you need more substantial aid and advice.
This is . Just what PROF. Â¦ LIVINGSTONE
gives you when you call on him for a first-
class clairvoyant reading. He asks j-ou no
questions, but tolls you what you wish to
know. ,
He does not mention all the ills and mis-
fortunes you are heir to. You are acquainted
with the facts in your case. Let PROF.
LIVINGSTONE analyse the matters that are
troubling j'ou, , find the cause of trouble and
suggest the remedy.

The End In Sisht.
THE PRESENT IMITATION OF UNIONISM
MUST PASS AWAY.
Within a ehort time this city will be plunged
Into the greatest labcr trouble in the history
of this or any other city.
What will be the outcome?
Grant eaid. "War la h â I." If he were
alive to-ds.y tie wouid consider the unionism .
of Ban Francisco worse than war.
The majority of leaders of labor unions are
so unscrupulous In all their dealings as to be
easily recognised as full-fledged anarchists in
everything but name. Their sole sim and de-
sire seems to be to pull down and destroy
rather than build up and foster. They care
nothing for either the safety or convenience
of the public or the welfare of those dei'ci.j..-..i
upon the ones under their control.
What do strikes brine men to? They tear
the honest, hard working man away from his
loving wife and family to do the bidding of
these unscrupulous affitators, even to defying
the laws, both of God and man: waylay the
honest non-union man, taking him by force
when honestly employed In his occupation, lay-
inir his bared arm upon the sidewalk and
jumping upon It until it was broken and trod-
den to a pulp, us1Â«k; threats and other violence
and InJsome cases even murdfr; Ftarves the
Innocent wife and children; destroys man's
business and forces him into bankruptcy, prac-
tically kills all commercial business and ad-
vertises world wide the anarchistic tendencies
for which they are noted.
The creat majority cf labor has time and
again proclaimed: â¢'Give them rope enough and
they will hancr themselves."
"We will wait and tee them do it" has'been
the motto of the non-union man, for, after all,
the non-union men are the conservative nun
of this country, who have always gained the
sympathy of the public and public opinion
J can never be dethroned.
Whatever may be the catastrophe ., to either
"capital and labor" In the forthcoming strikes
and consequent lockouts, we oj>enyy declare
ourselves before God and man that we will
never discriminate.
Â¦ To the employer so unfortunate as to have
these agitators and walking delegates force
a strike upon them our office will be ever
open, day and night, to supply you with help
you need.
To those more unfortunate because, when
held in the grasp of these unscrupulous agi-
tators, they were â¢ compelled to do their bid-
ding by Ftriking on their employers, we ex-
tend an earnest desire to make men of them
and by so doing we will place you side by
side with non-union men.

This Mule Is Touffh.
A correspondent with the Tibet mis
sion tells a mule story: "Mules, appar
ently, do not die from any cause, and
this mission has again proved the ex
treme hardihood of these animals.
When the mission first crossed the
Jelap-la'a mule slipped In the dusk and
fell into the lake at the bottom of thÂ©
pass. It was thought to be drowned.
Next morning a convoy found it with
its nose just above the ice, the rest of
its body literally frozen -in. Pickaxes
were brought and the animal -was dug
out. It is now' working as usual."â
dancing of Hoi>e and Emerson never
went unrewarded with hearty hand
claps. So clever was the work of the
principals that it would have made
the show a success without the chorus.
This Is not insinuating that . the en
semble was impaired by the chorus,
nor is it saying that the ensemble
would not have been improved by a
better chorus.
"Fiddle Dee Dee" is on for two more
performances. The remainder of the.
week and of the engagement will be/^
rounded out with a double bill. "Whirl-

The steamship Mongolia came out from the
drydock about daybreak yesterday morning
and steamed up to the Pacific Mall dock. When
she arrived there the tide was low, eo she
had to come to a standstill in the mud banks.
This left her stern up against the end of tho
long pier, while her bow was way out in the
stream. Hawsers were made fast and she
spent the day in thin position.
She will carry from this port an Immense
cargo, consisting in part of 1500 tons of rails,
besides a big consignment of flat can and
trucks destined for Kobe. She will sail about

TO SAIL.
Fouls Telegraph Cable.
The bcow schooner Plow Boy, while sailing
down the bay with a load of lumber, came to
an anchorage off Goat Island waiting for a
berth to land at. She dragged her anchor,
which became fouled with the Western Union
Telegraph Company's cable. After a long par
ley between the manager of the telegraph
company and the captain of the schooner the
captain finally consented to .slip his anchor
chain in deference to the proposition of the
telegraph company.
The value of the lost anchor amounted to
about |50. The cutting and replacing of the
cable would have cost the company an enor
mous sum. .
Captain A. L. Larson was in command. The
vessel has a speed of 11 ',i miles. Her cost
was $225,000. On May 1 she will leave for
Koggiung with a general cargo of cannery sup
plies. Fhe will be the last of the Alaska Can
ning Company's vessels to sail to the north.
The new steamer Nushagak made her trial
trip yesterday. It was euccessful. She is
owned by â¢ the Alaska Packing Association.
About ijixty people enjoyed the trip around the
bay, the boat steaming nearly up to Vallejo
before she started on her home trip.
Refreshments were supplied with a liberal
hand. Amons those on board were President
H. F. Fortmann. Vice President Charles
Hlrsch, Secretary C. W. Dorr and Superintend
ents H. C. Jensen. William Munn, Hugh Mur
ray and Andrew Nelson.
Nushagak Is a Success.

REAL ESTATE TRANSACTIONS.
Among the passengers on the steam
ship America Maru, which arrived yes
terday, was a party of distinguished
Japanese Government representatives,
who have been sent to this country and
Europe on various missions. The more
prominent of the visitors is Viscount
N. Matsudaira, a member of the Peers.
He is on his way to The Hague, but he
declines to state the real purpose of his
visit to that city. Another of the party
is Djo Kawamura, director. of the Civil
and Criminal Bureau of the Japanese
Department of Justice, who is to make
a tour of this country for the purpose
of gathering data regarding penal in
stitutions on this side of the Pacific.
Accompanying Kawamura is K. Kano
kogi, chief of the Japanese Communi
cation Bureau of Formosa,, and T.
Yaina Guchi, representing the Govern
ment and the tea exporters of Tokio.
In discussing the war in the Far East
Viscount Matsudaira said last evening
that the people of the United States
Â¦are receiving more news from the
scenes of battle than the natives of the
Island empire. He added:
Though the Japanese people have been en
deavoring in every way to place themselves
on a footing witW other and greater nations,
and have moceeded In many respect:?, I must
candidly conftss that they have not yet shown
the enterprise of the American and English
people in the getting of news of their own war
and giving it fresh to their own people. Dur
ing my short stay in Honolulu and since my
arrivai here, this morning. I have read more
news about tho Japan?se-Ru*slan war than I
wa* abie to obtain In a whole week in Tokio.
I have heard considerable comment in our
country and here regarding: the lateness of
the arrival from the front of news concerning
the. movements of our navies and armies. You
generally get your first tips regarding battle?
through KusMan sources, and confirmation
comes by way of Tokio. This I attribute to
the fact that the news from our forces has to
be brought a long- distance by our vessels,
which oftentimes have to take a roundabout
course to eliminate all danger of encounter
with one of the foe's craft, and the news from
the Russian side is simply censored and tele
graphed direct to St. Petersburg. When I left
Tokio the foreign correspondents were com
plaining to the Government officials for not
permitting them to move nearer the front. I
was Informed, however, that the newspaper
men would soon be given the long looked for
permission, and that thereafter they' would
not be interfered with.
The Italian cruiser Liguria, which arrived in
port on Saturday, was open to visitors yester
day. The majority of these goinff on board
went out from Crowley's boathouse, foot of Val
l<\jo street. Crowlcy statea that his boats car
ried out fully 10C0 people.
Among the passengers of note were
Sydney Fulcher, manager of the China
Traders' Insurance Company; G. Gans
loser, a prominent merchant of Singa
pore; N. Matsudaira, member of peers;
J. Kawamura, director of civil and
criminal bureau in the Department of
Justice, and K. Kanokoji of Formosa.
There -were also fourteen sprightly
Geisha girls, in charge of T. Gama
guchi. who will go to St. Louis to en
trance the visitors to the Exposition
with their graceful dancing and
almond-shaped eyes. They were a
fetching looking lot and attracted at
tention as they gayly scrambled on the
deck in their brilliant Oriental cos
tumes. A company of Japanese acro
bats of all sizes, ages and shapes
helped to enliven the life on shipboard
on the way across. They go to Glen
Island Park, New York. James W.
Price had them in charge.
Following is the list of 'passengers:
From Yokahomaâ W. W. Colborne,
Mrs. W. W. Colborne and -maid. Rich
ard Faber, Nate " Frankel, Sydney
Fulcher, G. Gansloser,- Mrs. G. Garis
loser, P. Geisendorff, K. Iwaya, T.

I On April 22 they sighted a three
-masted ship bound in an opposite di
rection. This was in latitude 34 3 N.
and longitude 133 33 W.
I She brought a small cargo consisting
; of 300 tons for this port, 134 tons des
tined for Eastern States and 13 tons
in transit to Central America.
An April 17, at 4:30 p. m., they spoke
the steamship Ventura in latitude
25 18 N. and longitude 151 48 W. On
April 20 they saw a big steamer, which
they supposed to be the Korea. This
was in latitude 27 39 N. and longitude
147 39 W.
The.Toyo Kisen Kaisha Company's
steamer America Maru came into port
yesterday morning, 17 days from Yoko
hama. After quarantine inspection she
steamed around to Mission Bay, where
she came to anchorage. She was com
pelled to do this because there would
be no berth for her at the Paciflc Mail
Steamship Company's dock until the
Gaelic departs to-morrow. The tug
Sea King brought the passengers
ashore and landed them on the wharf
at 2:30 p. m. The America Maru on ar
rival in Japan on her last trip from
here, was turned over- to the Japanese
Government to be used in case of need
as a transport ship. She was laid up
awaiting war developments, but no al
terations were made on her. The Gov
ernment concluded in April that it had
no use for her, so she was. released
and restored' to her original owners,
who immediately put her back on her
own route. * Her sister ships, the Hong
kong Maru and the Nippon Maru are
still in the service of the Japanese
Government.
Captain Woodus Greene reports that
during the voyage they experienced
changeable gales and rough seas and
the ship rolled heavily.
:. "Fiddle Dee Dee" is the most absurd,
ergo the most popular, of the Weber
& Fields creations. It was the first of
them presented in San Francisco, and
after a long run and a brief intermis
sion it was restored. to. the same stage
and held it for six weeks. The same
principals who presented it then, two
years ago, reappeared in it last night
at the Grand Opera House, and -the
way in which it Â¦ was received by an
audience that left room only
indicated that it could again attract
paying business for a month or more.
All the original "gags" and most of
the original musical 'numbers were re
peated, and they were rewarded" with
old-time laughter and plaudits. The
three comedians, Kolb, Dill and Ber
nard, carried the bulk of the honors,
of course, but the scenes in which Am
ber and Blake were the sole partici
pants got rapturous encores, and the
Slgnor Abramoff. operatic basso, is
one of the new offerings for the week
and he received abundant applause. His
three selections were well rendered and
his voice was in excellent condition.
The Four Mortons present a new
sketch. They are as funny , as ever.
Some of their best work they repeat
and the act is excellent. Ethel Levey
(Mrs. George M. Cohan) makes a- hit
as a singing and dancing comedienne.
She was encored several times and her
work had merit. Wilfred Clarke and
Company present an adaptation from
the German in the piece "In the Bio
graph." The sketch abounds in mirth
and life. Mile. Amoros, the trapeze
performer, . assisted by Mile. Charlotte,
commences her second week and the
motion pictures of "Faust" conclude the
show.
The show that opened yesterday aft
ernoon at the Orpheum was pro
nounced thorough, both in point of
amusement and in talent, by the large
audience in attendance. The new acts
are all good and the holdovers have
been changed so that the entertainment
is fresh from start to finish.- >
Lew Sully appears on the boards and
sustains his old-time popularity. His
songs are clever and every portion of
his wit brings a hearty laugh. He
earns and holds the title: "President of
the Laugh Trust."
La Petite Adelaide is a dayity dancer
and her grace and originality bring
much favor for her. She is lately from
the Shaftesbury Theater, London.
Tony Wilson and Heloise are on the
bills as originators of â¢ the "tramplin
bar act." They gave all that was ex
pected of them and offered some new
features.
The event of the production in local
eyes was the debut of Miss Beatriz
Bronte, who left here but a short time
ago as a subordinate in "The Princess
Chic" and returns now in the name, role
of "A Girl From Dixie." Miss Bronte
is the daughter of the well known oper
atic tenor, Fernando. Michelena, and
was until her departure from here his
pupil. She was warmly welcomed home
by a large contingent of friends and got
posies galore. The young singer was
very evidently, and naturally, 'afflicted
with nervousness last night, but showed
a large gain in experience in spite of
that. Her voice has rounded out, and
she has gained in poise, but has yet
considerable need of repose, and care in
enunciation. She makes a stunningly
pretty picture of Kitty Calvert, the
Dixie girl, and has some effective songs
that were heartily applauded. Essie
Lyons does a very clever bit of charac
ter work as a stammering girl, and
sings with much charm and ease. An
other'good voice is Charles H. Bowers',
that is only discovered in the last act.
Mr. Bowers is the hero, In real heroic
style.
M. Don is seen in a "Cherman" part
as Ludwig Regenborgen, Kitty Cal
vert's stepfather. He is rapturously
funny, and in a piano- specialty com
pletely convulsed the house. Thomas
J. Keosh has one moment to convince
the audience that he is an actor, and
he does it. Then there is Clifford
Leigh, by no means least, In an elab
orately funny picture of an English
Lord, and Charles K. French as a
clever Jack Randolph. There are plenty
of good songs distributed among the
cast and the concerted numbers are
conspicuous for the spirit and ease
with which they are sung.
BLANCHE PARTINGTON.
More like a high school frolic than
anything else that I can think of is "A
Girl from Dixie," presented here for
the first time last night at the Califor
nia Theater. The onus of description
is left to the audience, but the piece is
presumably a musical comedy, with
libretto by harry B. Smith and lyrics
and musical setting by every one else.
I fancy the libretto is not new. It is at
any rate x of the brightness â so far as
dialogue goesâ of the earlier Smith
"books." One is even tempted to quote
some of its many witticismsâand
temptation has been far from one of
late in the musical comedy field. As to
plot, the piece is' impeccably obvious,
if pleasant. Again, as to its figures, the
characters, though familiar, have been
oddly reshuffled; the Incidents also,
to their disadvantage. In the last act
only, for example, do the four excellent
comedians with which the piece is fur
nished get a fair chance .to show their
mettle. The first act takes place in a
country school. The second act takes
place in another schoolâ or rather
college. The third takes place in a
school girl's, or rather college girl's,
drawing-room. And like a high school
jinks, as before said, is naively, and
even charmingly, the effect of the
whole production.
The performance is quite In keeping.
With the exception of the tremendous
ly funny scene between the four come
dians in the last act, where the fortune
huhting English Lord brings along his
solicitor to arrange about the marriage
settlements to be made upon him by
the girl from Dixie, the piece never be
comes grown-up musical comedy. It is
short-frocked in the first act, ankle
length in the second, and in the finale
only adult comedy. But piece and per
formance have vim, freshness, naivete.
The voices are excellent, the girls are
pretty and the aforementioned little
used comedians all good. Victor Her
bert, Cole and Johnson and a round
dozen or so besides have been in at the
music and have furnished several good
if unrelated numbers. The scenic set
ting has not been much depended upon
in the reckoning, neither the costumes,
and there is a general happy-go-lucki
ness of the stage management. But the
piece was thoroughly enjoyed last
night in spite of everything â frantical
ly In places. D. L. Don > was most of
them.

And now the dogs have their beauty
doctors-rthat is, Paris dogs have them
if their owners feel moved to pay the
necessary fees for the attentions of the
profession. Sooner or later everything
that human beings find good is adopt
ed by or is thruct upon the dogs, es
pecially pet dogs, and, absurd as it
may seem at first thought that a mas
seur for dogs should be able, to earn
his salt, it is easy to see, after* a mo
ment's reflection, that an unselfish
mistress, knowing . the comforting
power of massage, should want "dog
gie" to. experience it, too. It's a far
cry -.from- the position in life that a
dog who "sleeps out in the shed" holds
to that of one who Is massaged into
trimness and daintiness.â Boston Tran

Meanwhile this story came to the

fickle sweetheart. He therefore secret

with her fiance and fell madly in love

A Complicated Love Affair.
The Reliance Club of Oakland will
next hold 'the center of the pugilistic
stage with an attractive double card on
Wednesday night. It is expected there
will be more actual fighting in the thir
ty advertised rounds than has been
seen since the Britt-Corbett affair.
Rufe Turner and Jack Cordell will be
the principal attraction. The public
frowns on return meetings as a rule
and the only legitimate excuse for giv
ing a defeated boxer . another oppor
tunity to make good is a question as to
how the previous bout should have end
ed. In the case of Turner and Cordell
this doubt exists. The white boy had
the going all his own way after the
flrst round and up to the eleventh,
when a well directed right hand swing
put him down for. the count. Careless
ness was responsible and Cordell has
every right to the fight he will wage
next Wednesday. Rube Smith is stak
ing his future in- these parts on his
ability to give George Brown a good
drubbing in the other event.

SUMMARY
Overall was not himself In the
morning game and Lohman's stars
simply eloped with the game. The
big fellow gave five bases on balls
and hit three men. Then his sup
port was shady at the critical stages.
Oakland played a swell game in the
field. Graham had a good day, al
lowing but seven scattered hits and
walking: no one. More than 4000 fans
crowded the new grounds and gave
Overall a great ovation. The score:

Overall in Poor Form.
A large crowd witnessed an excit
ing lacrosse contest between the "San
Francisco and Ran Mateo teams yes
terday at the Presidio Athletic
grounds.
The home team won by a score of
5 to 1, but the playing throughout the
entire game was even. The' rural
players lost more through poor luck
than poor playing.
In the first quarter of the game
neither side scored, and the ball was
rushed batk and forth many times
across the field. The second quarter
promised to end aa the flrst, until
Darragh, playing at inside home on
the San Francisco team, landed the
ball neatly inside ( the wicket of his
opponents.
Judge, playing second home, repeat
ed this in the third quarter, making
the score 2-0 in favor of. the home
team. The third quarter was by far
the most exciting. part of the contest
and several men were laid low by the
flying sticks.
From the sound o> the whistle in
the opening' of the fourth and last
quarter, the men r>layed furiously,
and it looked for a while as if either
side might score repeatedly. Crilly.
playing outside home for San Fran
cisco, scored In the'early part of the
play, and followed this by making two
more points. With the score standing
5-9, and. with but a few. minutes left
in which to. play, Martin Lyons of the
San Mateo team rushed the ball into
the wicket. He was unable to score
again before time was called. The

happiness, for to-day he had a smile
and cordial handclasp for all his friends
as they offered congratulations and
wjished long life and prosperity to the

But Casey has to fumble sometimes
and this was one of those times. It
filled ur> every base and along came
Buck Francks with a fly to deep cen
ter. Dcvereaux had all kinds of time
to come in, and he finally arrived and
to the downfall of Mike Fisher came
about. The score:
Oakland â 1 Tacoma â
That was the first run of the game.
Ganky had partaken of a base on balls?
and lost not a minute in stealing sec
ond. Francks'. out sent him up on3
and then the big stunt came off. Keefc
began to swing his mighty right and
Ganley started in the first go around.
He never stopped running, either, till
he landed Fafely on the rubber, amid
the frantic yells of the gathering.
Then the breathless anxiety ruled for
four more rounds. With one down
Lynch tore off a hit to left field in the
seventh. Kruger was not as spry as
usual and the bail got away from him
and stayed away long enough to allow
Lynch to fcramble to second. He had
hardly landed before McLaughlin went
out easily and it looked dubious for
Miko. Hannivan had the necessary
one in the shape of a bingle to right
that brought in the run.
The Tiger? were dead ones for the
rest of the game. But Oakland got a
start with the first man up in the
nlntti. Pfvereaux talked Keefe out of
a base en balls, but old Peter bunted
the third etrike. Buchanan simply
waited ar.d got his pass. Then the
hard luck error happened, when Gan
ley rolled a pretty one down to Casey
tnat should have been a double play
ar.d marked the close of the ninth.
CASITVS COSTLY FUMBLE.
Mike Fisher has ceased to be a head
liner in baseball society. He was the
big chief till the ninth round had
passed into history yesterday afternoon
at Recreation Park. Then the cruel
blow of fate in the form of a long fly
from the bat of one Francks landed in
the middle of Mikes plexus and he had
to give way to Peter Lohman. Mike
nevtr had a chance in the morning en
gagement. Scures: Morning â Oakland
7. Tacoma 2. Afternoon â Oakland 2,
Tacoma 1.
It was a real old gala day at the
park, for every one had heard about
Bobby Keefe, the boy wonder, and they
all wanted to be there when he started
in to bewilder the Oaks. He handed
out some choice curves, but was not
there with the control. His two bases
on balls in the last period caused him
to drop his first game this season.
Buchar.r.an really pitched a better
game of ball. He started off wildly,
allowing a hit and two walks in the
first round, but when he settled down
he had the Tigers reaching and jump
ing and making high signs at the ball
as it eluded their frantic efforts.
It was a swell panic of ball for the
fans to admireâ full of the brightest
kind of fielding and uncertain in every
inning. Streib, Eagan and Francks
were the kings of the fielding layout,
while Bobby Ganley had every one in
the let pulling for him when he stole
the plate in round three while Keefc
was doing a seven-day wind-up before
delivering the ba'l to the batter.

This was apparently as far as the
up-country dog could go, as he was
beaten in the decisive course after hold-
Ing his opponent level to the hare. Rub
ber Ankles led to the hare by a good
margin In the flrst three courses. She
was led a length in the fourth course,

Hudson carried off the honors in the

in the latter course. The score was
even when Haphazard caught the hare,
and a kill meant the long end of the
purse for his owner. Instead of killing:
he let the hare escape him, and Hud
son quickly scored a turn and the kill,
winning by a safe margin.
In the semf-final round Faraway led
Haphazard well, but the latter evened
the score, making it an undecided
course. At the next attempt Faraway
had lust all his bottled-up speed and
was beaten badly. Judge Reilly earned
the applause of the spectators by de
claring all bets off.

. In the puppy stake at Ingleside
Coursing Park yesterday F. Brown's
fast young greyhound Humboldt made
an Impression on the people who keep
tab on the dogs. The way he ran
showed plainly he is a coming courser.
Stake honors went to him by default.
Fiddler, the runner up, was with
drawn. As the *hare was liberated for
the last course the dogs were started
in pursuit, but in some manner the
slips did not act. Fiddler was released,
but Humboldt's collar refused'to work.
Fiddler ran up the field alone and wa3
a long time in pursuit of the hare be
fore he drove it to the escape. He was
then drawn. and bets were declared off.
Reckless Acrobat won the open stake,
beating Bright Fortune without allow
ing her to score a point. A few short
ends landed, some of them being- hard
knocks for the talent. Foxhunter was
?he cause of much sorrow for the wise
ones. In the second round, after an
undecided course, he took Pasha Pleas

The opening cruise of the San Fran
cisco Yacht Club took place yesterday.
At 11:45 a. m. Commodore W. G. Mor
row, on the flagship Challenger, set the
signal "R. J. M.." which, being inter
preted, signifies "Follow movements of
the flagship." Scarcely a breath of
wind stirred the unruffled surface of
the waters and the fleet lay idle at its
moorings until about 2:30 p. m.
During the long wait the members of
the De Koven Club furnished much
amusement by their funny stunts on
the club wharf, while a gayly attired
crew of bandsmen o'n board A. C. Lee's
sloop Ariel rendered several popular
airs on brass Instruments. The breeze,
when it did come, freshened rapidly
and the flagship, followed. by the sloop
Nellie, flying Vice Commodore H. H.
Jenness 1 flag, H. R. Simpkins' yawl
Tramontana, J. V. Coleman's schooner
Aggie, J. R. Hanify's schooner Martha,
W. F. Burke's little yawl Witch, R. S.
Bridgman'a sloop Thetis, the sloops An
nie, Curlew, Alice and Surprise, cruised
toward Fort Point and almost out to
Point Lobos. F. A. Hyde's motor boat
Vladimir went out for a trip in the
morning and again in tne aftemoon.
The breeze in the channel was steady
and true, delighting the yachtsmen so
much that they stayed too long. The
wind dropped and the flood tide set
most of the fleet to leeward of Alca
traz in the direction of Angel Island.
Toward sundown a little breeze sprang
up, but the yachtsmen were not able
to- shape their course for Sausalito un
til the tide bercan to ebb at about 7
p. m. All the yacfrts, however, reached
their moorings safely, though some
what late in the evening. .
The members of the De Koven Club
were taker, out for a cruise on F. A.
Robbins' launch Rob Roy, which land
ed them at Powell street wharf. Two
ct three of the San Francisco fleet
are not yet in commission, but will be
ready to sail in a week or two. M. A.
Newell's new schooner Lady Ada was
under sail yesterday, as also was the
sloop Corinthian.
Several well-known yachtsmen came
over from Tiburon to Sausalito on
Saturday night to attend the opening
jinks, which were highly successful.
Among the visitors were Commodore
T. Jennings, Vice Commodore J. C.
Brickell. Secretary E. J. Bowes, ex-
Commodore E. F. Sagar. "Jack" and
"Bunty" Short, F. E. Schober, Lester
Hammersmith, Frank Stone, Douglas
Efskine and S. M. Marshall of the Cor
inthian Yacht Club.
Some good practice matches were
played on the California 1 Club courts,
the best of which* was a doubles, in
which the Smith brothers won two sets
out of three from Frank Mitchell and
Harry Rolfe.
A return practice match between
Herbert Long of the California Club
and Clarence Griffin of the Golden Gate
Club resulted in another victory for

The fine -weather attracted many
players to the Park and California Club
tennis courts yesterday. : On the public
grounds a handicap doubles tourna
ment Xor the three-time cups was play
ed, while at. the club , courts the day
was given over to practice.
Twenty-si* teams entered the doubles
event and at the call of time late in the
afternoon but four were left to com
pete for the cups. The successful teams
were Norman Ambrose and Marius
Hotchkiss, playing from, scratch: A.
Brabant and Stewart Gayness, playing
from the "2-6" mark; George Bates and
E. P. Finnegan, on the "4-6" mark, and
Clarence Foley and Charles Dunlap,
playing from ."3-6" behind scratch. The
handicapping was better than usual, as
the scores show. No one of the four
surviving teams has won the cups.
The Baker brothers, the most heavily
handicapped team, were beaten , in
straight sets by Ambrose and Hotch
kiss. â¢ The latter took advantage of the
odds allowed them and won in straight
sets. The winners took all kinds of
chances and broke up the steady game
of their opponents. The first set went
easily to Ambrose and Hotchkiss. but
the second was close.
Will Allen and Clarence .Griffin were
called upon to give only "owe 3-6" to
Dunlap and Foley, but the latter beat
them easily.
By far the closest match of the day
was that between Fred Adams and L.
Howell and Charles Teller and R. Parr.
Adams and Howell won the first set
6-4. The last two sets were exception
ally long, but both finally went to Tell
er and Parr. The score was 1-6. 10-8.
9-7.

The crack of the rifle was heard all
day long yesterday at Shell Mound
Park. From early morning until dark
ness obscured the targets the marks
men were busy in their attempts to
place a good record to their credit. The
day was an ideal one for target prac
tice and attracted an unusually large
crowd of marksmen to the range.
The principal event of the day was
the King shooting of the Deutscher
Kreiger Verein. About one hundred
members of the company took part in
the event. The target used consisted of
a large wooden eagle, divided into dif
ferent sections, so constructed that
when a particular spot was struck by
a bullet the section would falL As
each part represented a prize there was
cheering when a lucky marksman, by
a well directed shot, brought a piece to
the ground. When all but the last
piece was shot away and the remnant
of the target was adjusted for the King
prize, excitement prevailed on the part
of the marksmen and spectators. As
shot after shot was flred and the Kin*
prize was struck several times without
bringing it down the Interest became
intense. When Henry Henninger step
ped forward to try his skill he received
encouragement from his comrades to
make his best endeavor. After taking
careful aim his shot rang out and
down came the, prize that made him
King of the Kreigers for the ensuing
year. He was welcomed on all sides
as sovereign of marksmen and tri
umphantly carried on the shoulders of
his comrades after he had been invest
ed with a wreath of roses and his In
signia of office.
In the Golden Gate Rifle and Pistol
Club contests Al. C. Gehret was- high
man with the rifle, making the good
score of 232 rings in his 10-shot string.
He also ran up a score of 1111 rings
in his 50-shot entry.
In the same club G. E. Frahm was
high man at the pistol target with 91
rings to his credit on two different oc
casions.

The woman's mind has been failing
for two years. At different times she
has been on the verge of going to the
asylum, but has always escaped upon
the ground that though a little queer,
she had never been thought dangerous.
Matters culminated a week ago, when
she took her youngest child, a babe of
four months, and tiled to throw it and
herself under the train. Mr. Enz took
care of his wife for a week.
Because she tried, to throw herself
and her four-month-old baby under a
Southern Pacific train, Mrs. Josephine
Enz was brought to the detention ward
of the Receiving Hospital to-day and
charged* with insanity. Joseph Enz,
the husband, brought his wife to the
insane ward and was forced to make
the charge of insanity, as he said, to
save the life of his wife and her chil
dren.

and Edward McAdams were walking
through the grove sfnd discovered the
corpse. The head lay twenty feet
from the body. Deputy Coroner Mee

In hl6 opinion the man had been dead
sbout two months.
There was nothing about the re
mains that would serve to identify the
unfortunate. The man was dressed in
a steel gray suit and wore black lace

The skeleton was exposed in many
places owing to the absence of the

Detective Cody, who was detailed to
investigate the report that the wife of
Walter Grady, patrol wagon driver at
the Park Police Station, died from the
effects of a blow on the" head from a
chair administered by her father-in
law, Attorney W. D. Grady, filed his
report with Captain Martin yesterday.
He reports that both Dr. Mizner, the
family physician, and Dr. Charles M.
Card, who was called into the case,
said that they had examined Mrs.
Grady's head, but found no evidence
of a contusion or fracture. Dr. Card
said that when he pressed her head
she complained . that it hurt her. She
never complained to them that her
father-in-law- had struck her with a
chair. Dr. Mizner had given the
cause of death as uremia. Â¦
Walter Grady, while admitting that
his father during a quarrel had aimed
a blow at him with a chair which had
struck his wife, said that it was an ac
cident as far as she was concerned. A.
Coleman, Mrs. Grady's father, said
that Attorney Grady had always been
kind to his daughter, ' who had, never
complained to him about being struck
with a chair. '- -Â¦'.-'Â¦." -

Speaking of conditions in^- South
Africa the Bishop said: fÂ£>k
"South Africa is in a state of 'seribua
commercial depression resulting ; in
part from world conditions, which -are
mostly out of. joint, but the trouble
arises principally from lack of labor.
"They require 200,000 more j laborers
to supply the demand of the mines and
railway building and other, public
works as well J as for agricultural and
other important developments. -/ .
"I am opposed to the introduction or
Chinese laborinto the Transvaal as a
permanent policy, but- 1 approve of
meeting the present exigency; by Intro
ducing for a time (foreign labor, under
strict contract laws, j not .exceeding
three years, and then returning, the

She further stated that she had been
traveling abroad in a party of foW.
but refused to give the names of any
of the* number. Just before the tug
reached the .wharf a tall, blank-faced
young man with a growth, of sandy
beard came forward and seemed solicit
ous for her welfare and was assiduous
in assisting her to leave the boat. She
was handsomely attired in a tailor
made gown of blue, with magnificent
furs of Persian lamb lined with ermine.
She said she would be in town several
days before going to Point Loma.
Among the passengers that ar
rived on the America " Maru yes
terday was Mrs. K. Tingley, the

a broadly affected English manner and
after a great deal of coaxing she
deigned to admit that she had been
traveling for the last five months. Dur
ing this period she had visited China.
India and had gone to Egypt up the
Nl!e as far as the second cataracts.
Her trip had been in no way for pleas
ure; it had been entirely in the in
terests of educational work. In speak
ing of her creed she said: "Our religion
is based on the best principles of all
religions. Theosophy and the Society

Bishop Funston is just returning to
his homo, from the conference of the
Missionary District of , the Pacific
Coast, which was held in. Los Angeles.
Bishop Funston spoke in. general on
the sorrows of life, saying that here
complete happiness is not found and
that afflictions and bereavements come
no matter what the position or condi
tion may be in life.
Bishop Funston of Boise, Idaho, de
livered a profound ] sermon at St.
Paul's Church, California and. Fillmore
streets, yesterday morning, taking 1 his
subject from the concluding words of
the gospel of the day, sixteenth chap
ter of St. John: "Ye now therefore
""have sorrow: but I will see you again,
and your heart shall rejoice, and
your joy no man taketh from you."
The service for the day was read by
the. Rev. W. M. Reilly. the rector.

"The work of unifying the English
and the- Dutch goes along slowly. The
English have been generous in donat

American Agricultural methods are

"The gold in sight at Johannesburg

with proper labor the output Â»f gold
would go to $250,000,000 a year. Before
the Boer war the output was $100,000,000
a year, but it has not nearly come to

Bishop Joyce has Just completed a tour
of South America and has great reports
of the progress of the church in that
pnrt of the world.
Speaking of the Panama canal.
Bishop Joyce s?Â»ld that the acquisition

ofticers of the Methodist denomination.
At 10 o'clock the distinguished church
men will assemble at the Occidental
Hotel and Bishop Hamilton will at
once be invited to preside, as honorary
chairman.
The deliberations of the day will be
of the most important kind. Among
other matters it is probable that the
reports from the Missionary Bishops.
Bishops from India, from China. .from
Japan and Africa will be placed before
the board.
We have tried a voluntary tender of Increase
when.no demand .wiie made; we have tried
conceding every penny, of. the. wage demand In
full and we have tried arbitration. All have
failed, and we have left open to us the only
course stllluntrled. If the union remains un
yielding.-We are prepared to try It. and yet,
in the face of all this, it Is our earnest hope
t hat good â¢ common sense . will . prevail among
the carmen. , ' , â¢. : Â¦ , . .
The company here states that it has gonÂ» to
the full limit of concessions, that It has not
and dot's not intend to discriminate against
its higher paid men. that it has no designs to
destroy of? disrupt the union; .that, as an evi
dence of perfect good faith In that respect. It
\ls willing: now to contract; with' thÂ« union for
la. period of from one to three years, and this
/despite thÂ« fact that every indication points
to a season of hard times that -Its urgent de
sire is to get along with its employes without
friction and earn and retain their confidence.
Any other course Â¦ would .be. shortsighted â¢ and
prevent the maintenance of a peace for which
we are paying an extra quarter of a million
dollars annually. The charge, when made, an
swers Itself. Why should we be willing to pay
bo dearly for peace and then voluntarily pur
sue the very, course that would defeat our-
Belves? â¢ Â¦ . '/
Take a single division: On the Rutter-street
system, where 188 men are employed, on the
day this rate goes into effect 4 1 men now re
ceiving 26U cents will immediately move into
the 27V4-cen"t class. At the same time 10 men
now receiving 25 cents per hour will move into
the 26',4-cent class, and it must be understood
that these promotions will continue throughout
the entire year over the entire sysem from day
to day as the men complete their one or two
years of service. This is meriy ' an illustra
tion of what will be taking place over the
entrt< system.
Tire trouble has been that our desire to be
generous has been attributed to cowardice and
has been credited to the force of the union,
and the men arÂ« being told that we purpose to
yield again. The man -who acts on this . as
sumption will deceive no ono so much as he
will deceive himself, and we warn our men In
all kindness not to allow themselves to be mis
led. - ' -
Â¦It Is hoped the carmen when voting will un
derstand thoroughly Â«he full meaning of their
vote." Thf: company has none to the full limit
of concession and this should be understood.
We desire to state unequivocally and finally
that after two years of repeated concessions
made for peace Â»Â¦(â¢ are through. We are pay-
Ing our men a great sum for a peace that has
not yet materialized.. A year ago we were
paying our men the 'highest " wages paid on
rarth to men in. similar employment on any
large systemâ this year we have been paying
them an increase on that high wage and have
tendered them a liberal continuation of that
high scale.
A statement that is being circulated to in
fluence the men now earning 27 Vj cents per
hour runs to the effect that the high priced
mm have been discriminated against. This- is
whispered, not outspoken. The present ecale
cf wages has been in effect for five months
and this is the record of dismissals for that
period. During the last five months two and
four-tenths per cent of the "5-cent men, one
and nine-tenths per cent of the 26',4-cent men
and only one-third of One per cent of the 27Vi
cent men were dismissed monthly. One-third
of one per cent is an extremely low percent
age. Â¦ We have had some figures -made to sat
lufy ourslvos as to -the generous effect the
wage scale tendered by the company will have
when in full operation.
Officials of the United Railroads could
not be seen at the company's offices
yesterday, but last night an official
statement was issued, which is as fol
lows: . '
President Mahon of the international
union spent the day largely at his
hotel. In the afternoon he went to the
Park on a Haight street car, but the
gripman who carried him did not rec
ognize him, and he paid his nickel and
rode in silence like an ordinary passen
ger. He returned to the hotel in an
other car on the same line and held no
converse with. the operators of the car.
When asked for information he said
that there were not and could/ not be
any developments in the situation until
the result of the men's ballot had been
counted to-night.
"I have not made the slightest refer
ence to a single one of the men of the
union," he said, "except the address I
delivered before the general meeting of
the union Saturday, night. I cannot
know more than anv citizen of San
Francisco what their action will be,
and I am awaiting the result without
anxiety. I have told them what the
company offers and explained the mat
ter fully. It Is a question purely for
the local employes to. determine, and I
must abide by any decision they
make."
COMPANY IS FIRM.
MAHON PREDICTS NOTHING.
A state of absolute uncertainty, main
tains regarding the action that will be
taken to-day and to-night in the secret
ballQt which will determine whether
the operatives of the United Railroads,
comprising nearly all the street car sys
tems of San Francisco, snail quit their
employment and go on a strike. Presi
dent Mahon, the-^international repre
sentative of the union; General Man
ager Chapman of the United Railroads
and Richard Cornelius, local president
of the union, are equally at sea regard
ing the opinion the men will hold when
they cast their momentous ballot.
No poll can be taken of the employes
of the company, because generally they
are disinclined to discuss the issues be
tween them and 'their employes. Ap
parently-.neither, side has made much
effort to do so. - Out of nearly a third of
the men employed who were inter
viewed denial was made- that any in
fluence had Tieen exerted, either by rep
resentatives of the union or emissaries
of the company, to influence their'ac
tion in voting. Reticence of their per
sonal opinions regarding the differences
existing between the union and the
company was almost unanimous, and
the few who declared their preferences
were those who upheld the â¢ action - of
the executive committee, which recom
mended a rejection of the terms of the
company.
