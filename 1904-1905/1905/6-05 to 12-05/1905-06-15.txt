NEW YORK, June 14.â Because he
emiled at a pretty girl, Edward Langdon,
a clerk in the office cf Robert A. Sharkey.
Naval Officer of the port of New York,
will lose ten days* pay. Although the
young woman made no complaint ,of
Lanffdon. the, fact that she seemed dis
pleased at the clerk's advances induced
a witness of the affair to make represen
tations to Secretary Shaw In Washington.
Langdon. a month ago. met the girl on
an elevated train, emiled at her, and.
thinking himself encouraged, dropped his
card into her lap. The girl tore the
card Into small bits and threw the pieces
on the floor. The incident was noticed
by a passenger, who gathered the pieces
together and learned Langdon's identity.
The card, its pieces pasted together,
\u25a0was sent to Secretary Shaw, with an ac
count of the incident. No name was at
tached to the communication, but the
writer declared that he was acting in the
interest of unprotected American woman
liood. He eaid that measures to punish
the offending clerk should be taken.
Laogdon confessed that he had smiled
at the girl, but with innocent intention.
He was at once fined ten* days' pay.

THE PRESIDENT
. NEW YORK,. June M.â A Jury in Jus
tice BischbfTs department of the Supreme
Court . to-day ' returned a J verdict of $2000
in favor of Miss Adelaide Clifford and
against the Denver and Rio Grande Rail
day Company. ;/'"/:;
Miss Clifford is an actress, and has been
connected with many well-known opera
companies. Last season she was engaged
with De Wolf Hopper iri "Wang," and
the injuries. for which she has Just been
awarded damages were sustained while
walking the ties of tho defendant's rail
road.
From this statement it must not be in
ferred that the actress was stranded, or
"broke," nor was she without a ticket to
take her to her destination. . A. H. Hum
mel, her counsel, told the Jury why it was
that the' actress was "counting the ties."
"Miss Clifford was traveling with the
opera company from Creede to Alamosa,
Colo.," said Hummel. ; "About 3 o'clock
in the morning the train pulled into Ala
roosa, but did not " go up to the â¢ station
platform. The trainmen ordered everyr
botly out, saying that it was as far as the
train went. Miss Clifford, protesting,' got
out and started to . walk . the ' ties to the
station. In the darkness she stumbled and
fell and v . sustained internal injuries that
Incapacitated her for work 'for some
time."
The Jury was out but a . few minutes
and returned a Verdict for the actress.

Many protests from persons desiring
to* compete for the Colon dredging were
received by 'the Panama Commission
here. Some of the contractors' ex
pressed the ifcar that the more fortun-.
ate competitors had obtained an inkling
in advance /of the work j contemplated
at Colon and would have an advantage
of : more time in. which to make i. their
borings and other investigations.
Others asserted that if they/ made any
bid at all, it would be absolutely blind,
because they, had not been able to as
certain what portion of the work to be
done was coral, what clay . and . what
sand and mud. \u25a0',;â¢ -i-"* :
There is, of course, great rivalry
among . dredging companies- and large
contracts to participate, in an under
taking of this magnitude, .but many of
the expectant bidders were -nonplused
when they found that â¢ the \u25a0 specifications
required that contractors bidding
should first visit the scene of the work
and | make borings, and that"-' samples
of 'these ' borings should â¢ accompany
the bids. Five weeks I had i becn'allowed

All arrangements for. this work were
made by Wallace,' chief engineer of the
canal, who is on the isthmus. The sit
uation was further' complicated by the
fact that after specifications had been
printed and distributed to. those /.who'
applied- for copies it was discovered
that a full page had. been omitted. from
the original copy, which had; been
mailed from Panama. \u25a0 .When- this error

These bids are for dredging: the deep
water harbor at Colon.; on the Atlantic

work will cost about $7,000,000. Speci

The exclusion of coolies from the Ha
waiian and Philippine- islands is cbnsid*
ore<s a hardship by the Chinese, who
also eor.tnlain of thw treatment they ex
perience at th<; hands of the American
customs officials.' Nevertheless, there Is
a genuine desire upon the part of the
Chinese Government for a speedy and
amicable adjustment of the questions at

PEKING. June 14. â The agitation and
proposed boycott of American goods by
Chinese merchants is apparently based
upon a misconception by the Chinese as
to American intentions in regard to the
exclusion act. A discussion of the sub
ject will be necessarily prolonged and
to arrange a new convention will take
time. Xtockhlll, the American Minister,
has assured the Chinese that America's
intentions arft fair and conciliatory and
the Chinese Board of Foreign Affairs is
apparently satisfied upon the subject.
The public is somewhat alarmed, hence
the ngltation of the boycott. t -^
This movement Is unlikely to attain
any serious proportions, although It is
uigr.'firHn!. indicating the importance
which is attached by the Chinese to the
questions Involved in the American ex
clusion act.

\VEIHAr\VEI TO BE j FORTIFIED.
It Is iKiiated cut that great difficulty is
experienced by the immigration officials
in executing the law, because ' of the
many bojus certificates which are pre
sented by Chinese. It is a well under
stood fact that tor, a consideration a Chi
nese coolie may procure in China a cer
tificate that he is a merchant or trav
eler or a member of the other exempt
{lasses. On ite face the certificate en
titles him to admission to the . United
States. So many frauds have been dlÃ
covered in the matter of these certificates
that the immigration officials examine
all of them most carefully. That fact ac
counts for the trouble experienced by
genuine merchants and travelers when
they arrive at United States ports.
Thus far lio feasible plan has been
\u25a0worked out to remedy the trouble; of
\u25a0which the Chinese complain. Secretary
Metcalf is in favor of Congressional leg
islation on the subject, providing for a
rigid supervision of the issuance of cer
tificates in China, the idea being to hold
absolutely responsible for the accuracy
of the statements contained In the certifi
cates the officials who Issue them.
SCR ANTON. Pa., June 14.â At the
third day's session of the executive coun
cil of the American Federation of Labor
here to-day, /fresldent Gompers, Vice
President O'Connell and Secretary Mor
rison were appointed a committee to wait
upon President Roosevelt to present to
Urn the subject of Chinese exclusion and
other matters affecting the Interests of
labor.
3IAAY BOGUS CERTIFICATES.
Some Eastern papers will go so far to
morrow morning as to declare that Secre
tary has received a severe repri
mand from the President, but the chief
executive's note merely calls attention to
the protest cf the Chinese "students and
travelers." and requests that something
be done for them. If it be ehown that they
have b*en Kiibjcccd to indignities.
The complaints of the Chinese Govern
ment about the alleged humiliation to
\u25a0which members of the exempt classes of
Chinese often are subjected upon thiir
arrival in the United States, together with
the threats- of the commercial guilds of
China to retaliate by boycotting American
made goods, j have aroused the business
men of this country to protest against
what they regard as unreasonable dls
crtmln&tloa In the enforcement of ths
Chinese exclusion laws.
SacrÂ«.tary Metcalf is defending his posi
tion by saying that he hes always endeav
ored to protect the country from an inva
sion of Chinese. He is not responsible
for the exclusion laws, but must enforce
them so far an lies in his power' as defined
by the United Slates statutes.
Secretary Metcalf did not care to dis
cuss the question of Chinese exclusion.
Baying that he know* nothing of any
differences arising trom the acts of cfli
ciiils la his department, or under, its
jurisdiction. Nevertheless, It Is known
that while the President is inclined to
uphold the immigration office, it is his de
tire that it should use more discretion In
dealing with Asiatics who have a right
to enter. '
METCALF'S POSITIOX.
The Chinese and Japanese recognize
this and thcÂ«r representatives here are
practically of one mind on the subject
of the exclusion of their people.
The Questions of Asiatic exclusion
are recognized here to have become se
rious enough for investigation by the
Government. Those opposed to modi
fication of the treaty as enacted in 1894
say that a modification would mean an
other race question on the Pacific Coast
that would be difficult of solving. Not
only will the Far West be against tak
ing down the liars to Chinese, but its
people will be for the exclusion of tho
Japanese.
Secretary Motcalf defends the posi
tion taken by the immigration officers
on tho ground that they are simply
following tlie letter of the law and that
th<-r? is left r.o alternative.
The secretary of the Chinese lega
tion hr.s been subjected to indignities
at a Texas port. Other cases have
h^on cited. The Boston episode has
stirred the President to action.

WASHINGTON, June 14.â Gradually the
negotiations, for. peace ,in. the Far East
are nearing a focus. . The one po^t "to
which the energies of those directly con
cerned: in them now 'are 'being directed Is
the choice-of . avplace for- the --holding.;, of.
the conference of the plenipotentiaries of
the belligerents. -.. - - â¢ â¢
It is known officially that three cities
now are '". under consideration by Russia
andr Japan. These cities, named in me
order of the likelihood of their flnal selec
tion, are Washington, The Hague and
Geneva. Thus -far no decision -has 'been
reached. \ Paris and Lonuon ; have : been
eliminated from the equation-;. t ls un
derstood that'the'Russian Government bb-
I jects to â¢ an ': Asiatic city, its I preference
being "for" some European capital. ? Af ter^
objecting to the â¢ holding of the confer
ence in Paris the i 'Japanese'-' Government
expressed a willingness to consider other
places which afforded adequate facilities,
although it Is assumed mat Japan's pref
erence-would bosome Far Eastern city
practically within the', theater"of war. â¢
Filially; however, the selection seems to
have narrowed down to the three cities
named. Objections have been made by
the Japanese "to. The" Hague; but it is not
believed that they are fundamental or uni
alterable. However, as the situation now
is, Washington appears to be the city
most likely to be selected. It can be said
on authority that if the , conference be
held, in" the United States it will be in
Washington. ;No other place in this
country "has been considered seriously, j
-An announcement.. of- the ., selection -of
the place of.* holding the conference Is
expected within a few-day*-.' lt may come
to-morrow and It may not come for sev
eral days..- Thus far 1 President .Roosevelt
has acted 'merely as an intermediary be

of the negotiations regarding the selec
tion of. a place of conference. He la in
no sense, of 'the term an arbiter. Should
a deadlock ensue-;a condition that is re

NEW YORK. June 14.â Orders were re
ceived at the New York Navy Yard to
day from the Navy Department at "Wash
ington to remove the guns from the fight
ing tops of the battleship Alabama. Or
ders have been issued also that the guns
are not to be replaced on tbe fighting
tops of the battleship Indiana, which . ia
being repaired. It is reported that tha
guns are to be replaced by range finders,
and that similar orders will be issued re
garding other battleships.
The news of the victory of Admiral
Togo In the battle of the Sea of Japan la
said to have brought about the decision
to put range finders in place of the one
pounders which have occupied the tops.
The fate of the battle was decided by thÂ»
superiority of the' work of the Japanese
gunners while the ships were still at
long range.
The department was Informed that tha
aim of the Japanese gunners was dua to
the efficiency of the men with the range
finders, whom the Japanese had placed In
the fighting tops. They were thus able
to "pick up" the Russian ships at a. far
greater distance than the Russians could
locate the Japanese.

TO THE RELIEF OF FIALA
guards on the wagons Is. instigated by tha
officers of the Citizens' Alliance with aoma
ulterior object In view. It is to be deplored
that such a condition of affairs should exist
in- this city at this time, where union men add
their employers are working hand-in-hand to>
build up our city. These so-called r guards
have been for the ''past wee!*" armed with
blackjacks, and some with revolvers, and on*
of .those very guards attacked a man on Sac
ramento and Leaventrorth streets a few days
age and cowardly struck him with a black
jack without any seeming cause or ' prorcca-'
tlon. He was convicted -in Judge Mogan'Â»
cr*rt. but sentence has been deferred..
tow it la preposterous to think. Mr. Chair
man, that any member of the Beer Bottlers'
Union or any member of the Labor Council
or any friend of organised , labor would for
a single minute tolerate any violence directed
toward the drivers of these wagons. Tha
Police Department of this city is fully- abta
and willing to guarantee for every man pro
tection and safety while engaged in the pur
suit of his business, and I therefore think
' it is the duty of this commission to suppress
1 this private guard system adopted in the city
i by those people under the guise of necessity
| to protect their drivers.
I had " the honor to be a delegate to tha
San Francisco Labor Council and I know that
violence has nothing to do with the methods
of advancing the Interests of organised labor.
Any one acquainted with the exponents oÂ£
organized labor, any man who knows such
men as Mr. French, president of the San
Francisco Labor Council, . P. H. McCarthy oC
the Building Trades Council, or such a labor
leader as Andrew Furuseth, would not tolerata
violence of any kind toward anybody what
soever. __
And I therefore move, you, Mr. Chairman,
that the Chief oC Police be Instructed to ar
regt any watchman or guard or driver on any
of ' these wagons whenever they are found to
carry arms. for. Mr. Chairman and gentlemen
of the commission. I firmly believe that it
is for the good name of this fair city that
thesa violators of the law should be arrested
and placed in Jail.
A letter from Chief of Police Dlnan was
read before the Commission last night,
saying that he had suspended Policeman
F. A. D. aurenhelm from the force on a
charge of drunkenness while on duty.
The case was investigated last week.

WILL PREVENT
ARMING GUARDS
A ' member of the Storthing, comment
ing on the bitter feeling in Sweden, said:
"Aristocratic Sweden is ' always In
clined to look down on democratic Nor
way. The Swedes resent what they con- j
sider our audacity in initiating dissolution
and dethroning the King. The latter has
always been influenced by an atmosphere
of the nobility of Sweden and seldom, vis
ited Norway. The Swedish upper cham
ber, too. is inclined to consider the rights
of the throne .paramount to those of the
constitution, which, however, is not the
case in Norway."
STOCKHOLM, June 14.â The attitude
of the laboring classes is likely to prove
a potent factor in overcoming any possi
ble disposition on the part of the Riks
dag to suggest the adoption of coercive
measures toward Norway and influencing
the Chamber in favor of accepting the
dissolution of Norway and Sweden.
Swedish labor unions are daily tele
graphing to Norway unions, saying they
will refuse to take up arms, and the
Social Democratic party has Issued a
proclamation to the laboring classes,
reading:
"It becomes more apparent dally that
the upper classes and reactionary news
papers are attempting to cultivate a sen
timent hostile to Norway, with the view
to calling the people to arms against
her in her struggle for liberty."
The proclamation says it is the firm
decision of the working men not to re
spond to a call to arms and asserts that
they intend to go out on strike through
out the whole country if the Riksdag
comes to such a decision. In conclusion,
the proclamation calls upon the labor
ing classes . throughout Sweden to mani
fest .their opinion of: the situation at
public meetings." . .. .'

ing to city officers the right to inspect the
books of the corporation and to audit all
accounts; guaranteeing the expenditure

; SACRAMENTO, June 14.â The Congres
sional Irrigation f Committee and the ac
companying; California delegations have
traveled about 2000 ; miles In California,
and ' during 'their entire : itinerary tney
have not seen a more remarkable demon
stratlon - of : the values of . irrigation and
of irrigation in different stages of devel
opment than during . to-day's journey . x
The t party reached ' Fresno San
Francisco at 6:30 this morning, and after
an early breakfast were driven in auto
mobiles through the raisin country as
guests of the â¢ Fresno Chamber . of Com
merce, first visiting the Chamber of Com-,
merce exhibit. ; A : remarkable concourse
of about : thirty automobiles first pro
ceeded for a trip of about twenty miles
through the country east of Fresno. This
is one of the principal' raisin-growing sec
tions'of'Fresno County.^which.has, it is
estimated, . no less than 80,000 acres cov
ered extensively ; with vineyards and or
chards. The remarkable development of
irrigation methods impressed the visitors.
They were surprised at the cheapness of
.water, costing only 62 cents an acre, be
ing diverted from the Kings River.
Congressman Cooper of Pennsylvania
stated that in his, opinion California had
arrived, at most complete methods of irri
gation; what had already been done indi
cated what could be done. He, did not
see much \u25a0 room for improvement In the
practical manner of irrigation, but he saw
rather the opportunity for extension of
irrigated areas. Returning, the visitors
went .west of Fresno through the country
devoted to dairying, an industry which
is placing, Fresno ; County among the
dairy counties of the State.
TAKE JAUNT IN AUTOS.
A trip was made out Kearney boulevard
for a distance of nine miles and the dis
tinguished party enjoyed an exhilarating
return to the train, some of the autos
making the nine miles in eighteen min
utes. Events succeeded j each ! other- so
fast, said Hon. W. A. Â«eeder of Kansas,
that he could not trust, his memory to
retain all the wonderful things he \u25a0 saw,
but jotted them down "in his notebook
At half past ten the special left for
Ceres, arriving at 12:30. There the vis
itors were met by Secretary George T.
McCabe, T.-C. Hocking and other mem
bers of the Modesto Board of Trade and
driven in automobiles through the irri
gated country to Modesto. The party
again boarded the train at 2:45 for Stock
ton. The visit to the Modesto-Turlock
country was a perfect revelation to the
Congressional delegation.
There they saw an area which, gather
ing a thrifty and industrious population
through the influence of irrigation, has
formed eight new school districts in the
irrigation districts in the last two years
and has increased .the. teaching and hous
ing capacity in many of the schools. At
the present time there are estimated to
bo 40.000 acres actually "under Irrigation
in the Modesto-Turlock district and there
are no less than 258.000 acres under ditch.
176.000 acres being in the Turlock system
and 82.000 in the Modesto system. Mo
desto got its irrigation system last year
and commenced to Irrigate; last fall. The
Turlock system has been going about
two years. ; v
VISITORS ARE PLEASED.
The visitors were pleased to see new
houses popping up .'all 'along the line-one
man had started to cultivate his land, his
dwelling now being a tent; he is building
a home in .this wayâ made between
whiles. \o â¢" , _ ' \u25a0\u25a0
At' 3:30 the party arrived in Stockton,
where the steamer Champion was board
ed for the Riverside Dairy Farm and the
reclaimed delta lands of the | San Joaquln
River in the vicinity of Stockton. "Collie"
Brown,' secretary of the Stockton Cham
ber of Commerce, and other members of
the organization ' were hosts on- this oc
casion. At the Riverside Farm the party
paid homage to her Majesty. Juliana de
Kol, the world's prize cow, celebrated for
her eventful journey to the St. Louis fair
under the auspices of the California Pro
motion Committee. Juliana gives about
her weight in milk every two weeks ; her
butter t ecord ' is ninety-two pounds and
seven and a half ounces in- thirty days.
The great diversity of conditions in Cal
ifornia was emphasized "by the fact that
in the San Joaquin Valley there was land
of great fertility, some of which had been
reclaimed from' the sea: and some which
produced abundantly through the applica
tion of water.
Senator' Perkins, Congressmen Know
land â¢ and I Needham and Charles S. Fee,
general passenger agent of the , Southern
Pacific, have joined the party. '
8 To-morrow . and Friday the great Sac
ramento Valley will be visited. This will
afford 'an v lnspection' of the largest and
most comprehensive irrigation project in
the United States.

dent l of the - Western Pacific, under the
supervision of Edward â¢- T. \u25a0 Jeffery. . presi
dent vof "the Denver and ,jÃio>, Grande.
This was done about two years ago. Bince
that time the interests behind the great
project of constructing 1250 milesof rail
road between 'Salt Lake City and San
Francisco have seen the necessity, of
altering many of the original provisions.
"We decided." said Jeffery. to-day, "to
make 'amendments . and additions which
will make a firmer bond and better se
curity."
The Denver and Rio Grande guarantees
the interest but not the principal of the
Western Pacific bonds/ Jeffery said that
this guarantee was not changed, nor had
this matter any connection with the alter
ations to be made in the mortgages.
.The first mortgage was drawn up by
Gould lawyers, but the one , to be substi
tuted was devised, in collaboration with
Gould interests, by three law firms' rep
resenting the underwriting syndicate,
among , them being Guthrle, Cravath and
Henderson and Strong and Cadwalader.
The syndicate to ' take over " the * bonds -Is
composed of Blair & Co., William Salo
,mcn & Co. and William A. Read & Co.
\ It was stated by representatives of the
banking houses that the old mortgage had
been canceled and new bonds would be
issued -to include ; certain necessary pro
visions desired by the underwriting syn
dicate. ' The original ' document consisted
of thirty pages, whereas the new one is
'more voluminous, comprising at least
\u25a0fifty pages.'^Of the old bonds, only a few
had been Issued as a formality, and they
will be . withdrawn.
NEW, YORK, June 14.â It; was admitted
to-day by ) Gould /interests that they, have
decided to withdraw thepresent Western
Pacific mortgage and $50,000,000 s "per cent
fifty-year, gold bond issue, authorized by,
the company, and substitute practically
a new mortgage, which" will . provide bet
ter security for the bondholders. ' '

through. . Clerk James- "W.". Harris
whether , Mrs.' James . TV.*' Putnam had
obtained a divorce from him in this
county he' told a remarkable , story. Ac
cording to Putnam, he was drugged and
forced to go through a marriage cere
mony while in that condition, the bride
being Miss A. Marriott of Baltimore,
?>ld. Later, ho says, while still suffer
ing: from the effects of the drug, he wm
compelled by the. woman and two maid
accomplices. to sign "a check for (5000.
Then , they took him to an asylum,
where, he says, he remained three years
before be was able to. escape. .Putnam
came to Denver becaune he received a
short note recently, .undated and un
signed, reading as follows:
"You are now free. Secured divorce
in Colorado. . Sorry for the trick I play
ed you."
, Putnam, who claims ho is a member
of tho noted New England family of the
same name, says that he met the wo
man at Sas Harbor about four years
ago. In August. 1900, he alleges. Mis*
Marriott arrived at the . resort, and be
cause of .her. beauty attracted wide at
tention. ' 4 Putnam won her.
Shortly after they became engaged
two men arrived, whom she called
"Brother Tom" and "Brother Jack."
Then an outlnfr was proposed, and ono
day the four went into the hills. Put
nam says that drugged wine was riven
to him when they had luncheon In the
woods, and that he remembers little
that occurred after that until he found
himself in a cell in the asylum. He says
a marriage ceremony was gone through
with while he was In a druseed.con
dition, and that later he was riven a
blank check, which he was forced to
sign. Then he was taken to a so-called
sanitarium, where he remained utnil he
convinced a guard that he was sane and
the latter aided him to escape.
Court officers say Putnam explained
the woman's action in drugging him by
saying that she wanted money quick
ly, and. the marriage wu not to have
occurred for several months.

Bone, who is large framed and muscular,
has a 20-year-old daughter, Zola, and Mr.
Porhal, whose physique Is comparatively
puny, has a seven-year-old son, name not

his boy had been treated fty Mrs. Bone,

Mr. Bone emerged from the domicile

upon and repummeled. Mr. Bone denied
that he delivered the alleged "j01t,." but
confessed that he did administer a shove,
to which he was provoked by Mr. Porhal's
"sassy" language to Miss Zola.
"Why, if I had hit him as hard as he
claims I did." said Mr. Bone, with pride
in his brawn, "he wouldn't be able to ap

"And you wouldn't be able to circulate
publicly for several months," dryly quoth
Judge Cabaniss.
Mr. and Mrs. Bone and Miss Zola swore
that they had simply reproved Master
Porhal for having maliciously cast gar

their offspring was a. rag ball, which was

Merritt has been found necessary as a
protection, though so far there has been
no actual damage, done. the baths."

soon repaired immeasurable damage will
be done to the* baths.
In order to protect the baths from the
beatirg of the breakers Mrs. Emma I*.
Merritt. executrix of the will of the late
Adolph Sutro, filed a petition yesterday
asking permission of, the court to expend
130,000 from the funds of the estate to
repair the breakwater,' which the recent
storms have undermined.'

Nor was his arrest effected without

accomplish it. His grasp was on the col

If pou have within you a love for the
beautiful in architecture, betake yourself
to-day, or any day until Saturdayâ out to
the snug little home of the Sketch Club,
130S California street, and see there the
drawings of a lot of clever menâ the men
In whose hands lies the architectural fu
ture of our growing city and its envirous.
Last night the exhibit opened with a re
ception at the clubhouse, where the
guestsâ and they came In bunchesâ were
received by Mrs. J. J. Brice, Mrs.' H. H.
Fassett, Miss Anne M. Bremer, Miss Jo
sephine Eckler, Mrs. Bertha Stringer Lee.
Mrs. Albertine Randall Wheelan, Miss
Frances Randall, Miss Jennie McElroy
and Miss Nellie Tay.
For the first time in the history of ar
chitectural exhibits In Sari "Francisco 'has
the general trend of the work been dis
tinctively Californiaâ that is. partaking of
the old mission type, or going further, the
picturesque Moorish type, so essentially
fit in "New Spain," as the early Span
iards were wont to call California In' its
youth.
That this picturesque phase of architec
ture lends itself to the atmospheric and
social conditions in the West there is no
gainsaying, and it bears the stamp of in
dividualityâof personality.
It has come to be symbolic of Califor
nia and the Southwest, where the old
padres builded. and it is a, matter of con
gratulation that the architectsâ the men
to whom. we must look for the crystalli
zation of our architectural ideals â have
realized the possibilities -and the advan
tages of the new California school.
Leading in the exhibits of such types
of work are Sutton & Weeks, who show
a dwelling. Dr. Harshall's, that ought to
be an : inspiration to other contemplative
builders. -LÂ«:Viv^ r^"'
The same . firm has likewise put itself
on record for an artistic schoolhouso,
likewise in the mission style, that's {food
to lock at. and presumably; as good to
occupy.
G. E. McCrea -shows a fine artistic
sense, as well as "practical" sense, in 'his
Dutch interiors. William j Knqwles gives
a block plan for Piedmont, the" high-bred
rival of Burlin game, besides some other
interesting things in the new California
school.
Among those whose work is of special
interest are: John Galen Howard, Cox
head & Coxhead. Mooser & Bolles, Schulz
& Brown. Edgar A. Mathews, Sutton &
Weeks, S. Schnaittacher. Reed Bros.. Q.
E. McCrea. Bliss & Faville, Albert Farr.
William Knowles, Willis Polk, Maybeck
& White and Newton J. Tharp.
Mr. and Mrs. Louis Baldwin Parrott
have sent out cards announcing the wed
ding of their interesting daughter. Marie
Louise, to Francis McComas, the cere
mony to be celebrated at noon on Wed
nesday, June 28, at Trinity Church. And
thus is the pretty romance to end as it
should.
On June 28 Dr. Richard Follls of Johns
Hopkins University will wed Miss Louisa
Riggs of Baltimore, said to be one of
the handsomest girls In a city famed
for its lovely women.
The wedding : will be /celebrated !in
Washington at the home . of the bride's
aunt. ' Clarence Follls having gone/ on

.From Angel Island a straightaway
course was taken to Alcatraz. where the
visitors saw the military prison at close
rasge. Goat Island and the. training
station were also encircled and the Ukiah
then headed for the ferry building, ar
riving at n:3O with a load of passengers
enthusiastic over the picturesque scenery
cf the bay. At 1 o'clock the second ex
cursion, composed of Caiifornians, board
ed the Ukiah and the trip was repeated
without further incident.
Supreme Knight Edward L. Hearn.
much to the disappointment of the many
excursionists, did not make one of the
party of prominent officials aboard. He
spent a restfui day at the St. Francis
after the nard work of the convention
and the fatiguing entertainments that
have been given In his honor both here
and in Los Angeles. In the afternoon he
took a short automobile trip through the
c:ty. He expects to leave either this
evening or to-morrow evening for Port
land, where he will visit the Lewis and
Clark Exposition.
The entertainment provided for the
evening attracted not only the Knights
end their friends, but many others, who
came to see the special features sure to
be introduced on an occasion of the kind.
Throughout the various turns constant al
lusions to the failings of popular mem
bers of the order were made and many a
eood laugh was had at their expense.
At the middle of the programme, lan
tern slide views were thrown, showing R.
P. Doclan. chairman of the committee of
arrangements; the Hey. J. P. McQualde.
State chaplain, and Grand Knight of Cal
ifornia Phil J. Fay. All were received
with hearty applause. A moving picture
was also shown taken from the play',
"The Sign of the Cross."
â¢ This, morning four hundred Knights will
take a trolley ride through the city.
Blanir.g from Second and Market streets
at 9 6'clock. At 2 p. m. they will visit
Oakland, stopping off at St. Mary's Col
lege and inspecting the University of Cal
ifornia. At 8 o'clock Knights and ladies
are invited to witness the athletic tour
r.araent at the Olympic "Club as guests,
end at 11 p. m- trips through Chinatown
will be in order.
After the Ukiah left the slip she head
ed dewn tne bay to Hunters Point, pass
ing the Union Iron Works and the three
b:g cruisers building there. At Hunters
Point the drydock called for commenda
tion end after a thorough view of it had
been .given the boat's nose was pointed
northward and the rcn of the water front
was made close in shore. As the Ukiah
passed many factory whistles and harbor
craft blew three blasts in salute, to which
the Ukiah unfailingly responded.
The Ukiah continued northward along
the water front and westward, passing
rhe Presidio and almost to Fort Baker.
Then she ran across the gate to the
Marin CGunty shore, which was hugged
closely to enable the excursionists to view
the pretty homes nestling in the wooded
hills at Sausalito, Belvedere and Tiburon.
The vt^sel continued en through Raccoon
Straits almost to Red Rock, after which
the course was retraced to south of Angel
Island.
At S:SO. j-esterday morning the Ukiah
began to take on an appearance of life.
Early the visitors gathered at the ferry
and ur.aer the escort of local committee
men were stowed safely aboard the boat.
2<Â»"ot a hitch occurred in the programme
r;cd by S:4O .fully 1000 knights were on
the heat and the trip about the bay was
begun.
Last night 1000 seats at the Orpheum
were bought up by the local councils and
distributed among the visitors and many
vx fortunate enough to receive tickets
lor the large party were treated to other
theaters in smaller numbers. Many
hundreds of visitors visited various por
xv.r.i of the city and the influx of vis
itor? to Chinatown startled the inhabi
tants. . ,
The second day of entertainment
planned by the local councils of the
Kmjrhts of Columbus for the entertain
ment cf their Eastern visitors who are
Dn tne way home from Los Angeles was
given over yesterday to bay excursions
and thoater parties. The boat UHiah was
chartered for the use of the visitors, who

To Whom It May Concern:
MTen weeks ago I began
taking treatment with Dr.
Wong Woo. 766 Clay St.
S. F. Had suffered with
stomach troubles for years,
and for the last 13 months
with < spasms of the stom-
ach. American doctors
could do ' nothing 1 for mo
but " give *me morphine to relieve . the
pain when >\u25a0 one of the attacks came on.
Though I had been having the spasms
every other day before taking Dr. Wong
Woo's teas, since the first week I have
had *but two light attacks and both
these from â¢ eating improper food. I
feel I am 100 per, cent better than when.
I' began staking -hl3 "teas. : One -result
that is entirely unexpected is ! that the
sight has'returned to my left eyÂ«. For
years. l only saw shadows; now I can
distinguish objects quite plainly. \u0084:
I also had chronic "kidney "and. liver
troubles. 1 with great pain and. soreness
in the back; now the distress is entirely
gone and I consider myself a well man.

although his body cleared the tops of the
box cars, he was not high enough to es

above the train, and as each car passed
he was dealt a blow which swung him
almost to the top of the- bridge, only to
fall back against the wheel on the top
of the following car. '.
Not until almost the entire train had
passed was the plight of Doggett- and his
companions noticed by the train, crew,
who hurriedly stopped the train and re
leased the men from their perilous posi
tions. Doggett, bruised and almost in
sensible, was at once taken to the hospital
at Point Richmond, where it was found
that although no bones were broken, he
was so badly Injjred by the heavy blows
dealt by the iron wheels that there Is but
little hope of his recovery. Both of Dog

by the passing cars,- and beyond being
badly shaken uj> when the staging was
blown, from under their feet- were not

The Seals did not have to work hard to
take a fall out of the Portland Giants
yesterday : at Recreation Park. - for they
were all there pretty strong with the club,
and a muff by Schlafley came ln so handy
as to. let a 'couple of men come over the
river. Plenty of snap and ginger was
mixed through the nine spasms, and the
fans were given lots af action In return
! for the price. Score: San Francisco 4,
Portland 2.
Bert Jones had nothing concealed in the
expanse of his southern. wing that baf
fled Uncle's stars to any degree. He is
lucky to. have escaped with />nly a four to
two beating. The way in which the Seals
were stinging the leather. made it look as
though they intended shoving about a
dozen over before they quit.
, Henley mixed up a bunch that was good
enough to beat any mans ball team. . At
that* the Giants chopped off a few lucky
hits arid . made their j two runs easily.
Again bad baseball helped keep their
score. smaller than it should be. Atz was
caught I asleep off second ln the - sixth,
while Schlafley was nabbed at second on
a bad throw by Spencer in the ninth.
When any - kind . of coaching -would have
landed him safely on the bag.
'In the third. Spencer and Waldron beat
out infield blnglers and made a' double
steal r.n - Baby McLean while he was
dreaming of honeymoons. Two were gone
at the time and Hildebrand saved the life
of Uncle Hank by clouting one out past
short that brought 'em both through and
gave Uncle a lead of two for a starter. -
The Giants came near tangling It up ln
the next period, when McLean tore one
past Gochnauer, with Van . Buren ' and
Schlaflf y on the paths. Van came through
all right, but Schlafley was nailed a city
block at the pan, so true and sure was the
throw j of j .Walron from short center
field.
The Giants said good night to victory in
the fifth. Spencer and' Waldron tore off
hits. and a double steal again, and Jones
was unsteady enough to walk Irwln. Joe
Nealoii, who had two hits already; popped
up a high fly back of second. Householder
and Schlafley officed up to the ball, and
the latter finally decided to grab it. Just
as he was about to squeeze good and hard
the leather made a getaway and two men
arrived. \u25a0 - "
Deacon Van Buren turned his ankle
while tearing Into the second sack ln the
fifth spasm, and he may be out of "the
game for several weeks. The Deacon was
caught off . his , balance and came down
with full force on; the foot. The crowd
gave Schlafley the hoot for trying to pick
a fight with Danny Shea over a dispute
at the plate. The score:

The Whitney stable will have no can
didate lv the Suburban this year. Irish
Ltd, an idol of the public in his day, has
gone wrong -and has been withdrawn.
The Picket, too. which figured promi
nently in the winter books, will be ab
sent when the barrier goes up. The .West
ern candidate. Proper, is always fit and
always dangerous. With the burst of
ppeed that several times he had given evi
dence of possessing at the end, his
chances of reaching the wire first, if he
is with the leaders in the stretch, are by
no means slim. English Lad, Fred Cook's
entry, is well thought of, although his
price will be long:. John E. Maddens Ad
be] 1 is to be reckoned with, as well as
the lightweight Jacquin, an added starter.
He romped away with the Myrtle stakes
at Gravesend to-day, negotiating the mile
and seventy yards in 1:44 3-5, and winning
by half a dozen lengths eased up. s)
Ostrich, carrying ninety-two pounds,
may do as well as he did in the Brook
lyn, wfien he gave Delhi a hard race, but
he has not been in good temper of late
er.d will need clever handling. Among
the others are Graziallo, a long shot,
which frequently carried off the ' money
at an unexpected moment, and First
Mason, a stable* mate of Colonial Girl,
neither of -whom it would be well to over
look. The entries, with the probable bet
ting, are:

with the green stretches and splendid
racing course reaching almost to the sea
ehore, will witness to-morrow the twenty
e econd running of the greatest of Ameri
can handicapsâ the Suburban. Bright
ekles are forecasted, a fast track has
been prepared and a goodly field of thor
oughbreds will contend for the $20,000
stake, all of which gives promise of a
record-breaking crowd.
ThouÂ«h only twelve horses are carded
to" go. It is a well matched field, with the
possible chance of any one of the num
ber reaching the wire in the lead, from
Delhi, which carries the heaviest Im
post, to the lightly weighted Ostrich,
with the feather Crlmmins on his back.
Once more the Keene and Belmont
stables have given of their best, and Del
hi, which carried the colors of James R.
K>ene ln the last Brooklyn handicap and
v.-hose winnings the previous year were
greater than any other horse ln the East,
and Beldame. August Belmont's splendid
little mare, which won twelve of her
fourteen starts last year ln tba'name of
Newton Bennington, will divide public
favor. "Which of the two will be installed
ihe actual money favorite at post time
Is problematical, though Delhi on form
would seem to have a call. Delhi's clever
Winning of the Brooklyn with 124 pounds
would seem to outweigh the mare's vio
tory in the Standard stakes a week ago
over Cairngorm. Though the greatest
filly of last year, greater even than
famous old Imp, Beldame this year seem
ingly has not up to recent days rounded
into form.
NEW YORK. June 14. â "Dave" John
son's four-year-old colt Jacquin was
favorite and winner of the Myrtle
stakes, a selling affair, to-day at
Gravesend track. It \ was the . only
stake on the programme. Jacquin came
from behind the paoemaker. Gold Ten,
ln the last half-mile . and won the race
ln fast time. The first mile was run ln
1:40%. , \u25a0 \u25a0 1
Johnson had a heavy bet down on his
colt and was prepared to protect him.
He was entered to be sold for JIBOO, but
no one bid and the j>wner was voted
lucky. Jacquin was ridden In . clever

Many of the stables "which have been
racing here all year have left for the
Memphis meeting. Most of the bookmak
ers ' have expressed themselves as unwill
ing to take a chance against the felony
punishment, which is the penalty . for
making books after Friday, when the old
breeders' law goes out of action. There
will be enough left, however, to make a
thorough test of the law. It Is understood
the management of the course has agreed
with the prosecution tnat In event of a
conviction nic punishment ' will be a fine
instead of a felony sentence. ' The new
law is considered so defective in wording
that the racing authorities are confident
of being able to continue promoting the
sport. Summary:

Rheumatism does more than any other dis- .. , ,
case to rob life of pleasure and comfort. It is so painful and far-reaching in
its effects on the system that those afflicted with it find themselves utterly
unable to enjoy bodily comfort or any of the pleasures ofl if e. Some are
bound hand and foot and suffer constantly with excruciating pains, swollen,
stiff joints and l muscles^and tn}ubled h&jmatiBm ' f two
o.ten distorted crooked ycars> faad under the - treatment \u25a0of physi-
linbs, whiie others have dan^ and. tried everything recommended to
\u25a0aten^als of freedom, during - m^ i,ut all to no avail. My knee and elbow joints
Trhich they live in constant were so stiff that I could not use them. I was un-
fcar and dread of the next able to do my household work, and was truly in a
attack, when, at the least ex- pitiable condition. S. S. S. cured me after using
po^nreto damp weather, or it for awhile, and I unhesitatingly give it the
rti<rht irresrularitv of any credit it so much deserves.

The cause of Rheumatism is a sour, acid condition of the. blood, produced
by food lying undigested in the stomach, poor bowel action, weak kidneys
and a general sluggish condition of the system. External applications, such
as liniments, oils, plasters, etc., do not reach the cause and can only give ter-
n -Jim., porary relief. The blood must be cleansed and puri-
/pSj^ /?P^| fied before a cure can be had. S. S. S. attacks the
disease in the right way â it neutralizes the poison
fe*?*!? &N*if I&SOT an^ fi^ ters out every particle of it from the blood,
SE2ES/ *&3r stimulates the sluggish organs and clears the sys-
tem of all foreign matter. It cures the disease permanently and? safely
because it contains no harmful minerals to derange the stomach and diges-
tion. Book on Rheumatism and any advice you wish, -without charge. .

City. There is a mistaken idea that
a fabulous price Is offered for â¢ any

The custom of the National Guard of

State on. Memorial day until 12. o'clock
noon and will then be hoisfed to the
top of the staff, to remain there until
sunset." . . . .'
A ludicrous instance of absent mind
ednesa was afforded by the pastor of a
church In a small town of Virginia.
Not long ago. one Sunday morning, this
minister forgot to give the usual an
nouncement of social events for the
week. He had uttered some words of
his final blessing, when a deacon, in a
whisper, invited his attention to the
omission. Whereupon the clergyman
ceased praying and said:
"Brethren. I omitted to Inform you
that an oyster sapper will be served at
Brother Mullin's house next Friday
evening, the 20th instant All are in
vited to come, bringing their own bowls
and spoons." Then, continuing his in
vocation, - quite unconscious of the hu
mor of the situation, the worthy, man
added: . :. ''i^-.i

IN view of Attorney General Moody's decision respecting labor
on the Isthmus of Panama in the canal zone, it is necessary
to spread abroad the information on that subject recently fur
nished by our Minister, Mr. Barrett. On the 25th of April last
Mr. Barrett sent this to Washington:
"American white laborers find themselves, after a short stay
on the isthmus, without funds or work. If it were possible for
them to do manual labor in the sun, like the Jamaicans, and at
corresponding wages, there would be plenty for them to do, but
they cannot stand that class of work. Finding themselves in these
straits, they come. to the .legation and the consulates, and not know
ing that there are no funds provided by the United States for
the care of stranded or indigent Americans, expect the Minister
and Consuls here to provide them with food and lodging until they
can get employment, or to give them passage back to the United
States. It is often difficult to persuade them that the Minister and
Consuls are not responsible for their condition. 'When questioned,
these laborers says they gained the impression from the news
papers that there was abundance of work here at good wages for
everybody, and in most instances they gave up fairly, good em
ployment in the United States in order to do better .here.
"A remarkable feature of this situation is that these men come
from all parts of the United .States. The last steamer brought
laborers from Maine, New York, Tennessee, Illinois, Colorado;and
.California, and they have all been obliged either to go without
employment or to take work in competition with Jamaican or other
colored labor, which they will not be able to endure for any length
of time. In a report submitted last year I gave warning of the
same nature as this one, but the effect of it now seems lost. It
would, therefore, seem wise that it be given as wide publicity as
The wider the publicity the less of suffering and disappoint
ment will be experienced by infatuated El Dorado seekers, under,
the vertical sun of the isthmus. The opinion of Attorney -General
Moody leaves somewhat uncertain the kind' of labor that can be
employed on the canal. But nature has made it certain that it
cannot be white labor from the United States. If the Jamaican
coolies are in sufficient number they may be able prosecute
the work.
LABOR ON THE ISTHMUS.
IX France, spring's paradise of blos

Leigh Hunt's expressed opinion:
"An exquisite invention thisâ
This art of writing billets doux
In buds and blossoms and bright hues."
To put one's affection into the poetry
of nature's living words becomes here a
pleasure so natural, so spontaneous, that
it has the force.of an Inspiration.
Flowers gain a new value as a medium
of expression in a land where they may
be had for tho plucking, or for expendi
ture infinitesimal. For they represent not
money, but thought: not an extravagance
of gallantry, but the. simplicity of a gen

The flowers of Paris are' an important
element- in its gayety and in its love
making. "Where much is artificial, and
where superficiality Is the .rule, they give
the touch of nature without which no
performance can be a perfect work of
art. \u25a0â¢\u25a0â¢\u25a0â¢â¢ :
Yet even they have sometimes about
tliem the artificial touch of . sentimen
tality; for instance, when that "exquisite
invention" to, which Leigh Hunt refersis
employed, and every flower in' a bouquet
bears its individual message, when a
pansy means "I'm thinking of you," when
a rose tells of its sender's love, when a
bunch of flaming tulips is an ardent dec
laration.
In May and June both old Pari3 and
new Paris are eloquent with flowers. In
the famous market by the Madeleine,
along the quays, on the corners of the
boulevards, in dusty little side-streets,
there is this marvelous warmth of floral
beauty, whose like \no canvas could por
tray, however great the artist's genius.
And all the air around ia filled with fra
grance of roses, of lilacs, of honeyed blos
soms of syringas, of snow-petaled lilies

transformed into a little boat, white

should become acquainted with a new de
light in living and in loving; that a
lover's dreama of jdy and fear should
express themselves in gifts of flowers.
Always has there been an intimate as
sociatibn between the poetry of love and
the poetry of flowers. As Campbell

bonnets do in regard to color, but which
possess as well the perfection of nature's

T T is fortunate for the members of Congress who constitute the
Irrigation Committee that their itinerary has been changed so
A as to include the great irrigation districts of the SanJJoaqum
Valley. In its original form their tour included only Southern
California and a brief visit to the Sacramento Valley. But the
whole subject of irrigation is a novelty to the Eastern members of
the committee, and their interest in it has grown with their ob
servations. Being unacquainted with the methods and the results
of irrigation, their enlarged view of the subject has ed them to
inspect it in its very center, where more than in any other place on
this continent it has produced the most gratifying results.
In the San Joaquin Valley they have an object lesson that
cannot be forgotten. There they see land lying "above the ditch
of the same quality and capacity as that which is under the water.
They see irrigation applied to a greater variety of valuable produc
tion'than anywhere else in the world, and they cannot be mistaken,
for they see" the land before and after taking water. Before,, its
features arc those of the desert. After, it is transformed into*a
garden, equal to that which was "planted eastward in Eden. At
Modesto and Turlock they may study .the economies of irrigation
in a system that fertilizes'two hundred and fifty thousand acres of
land at a cost for the whole of only $ro per acre.
When they meet the pioneers of irrigation in that region they
may learn of the nerve-racking and fortune-losing effort by which
that great work was accomplished. Long held up and fought by
instigation and intrigue, it had to work its way over obstructive
litigation, popular distrust, neighborhood suspicion and every form
of opposition that can be imposed between a great public improve
ment and its realization. So they may study not only irrigation and
its effects, but get an idea of the energy and devotion which Cali
fornians bring to bear in overcoming vast difficulties laid upon
great enterprises. Now the great canals are running full of the
surplus waters of the Tuolumne River, the alfalfa fields are greening
for their second cutting and the immense stacks of emerald hay look
like the public buildings of a city.
At Fresno the committee sees the pride of California. That
region controls the raisin market of the United States and is busy
at the conquest of the raisin market of the world. . There irrigation
is applied to a variety of field and fruit crops, vegetables and shade
and ornamental trees and shrubs that are not found in group on the
same soil and under the same sun anywhere else in the world. The
committee will in the same region get an idea of the various uses pi
the same water. It brings sawed lumber from the mountain forests
in fitfmes and, after delivering its cargo, flows into ditches to irri-a
gate the plains. They ride in streetcars moved by electricity gener
ated in the mountain streams by the same water that makes the
delightful panorama of orchards and vineyards, green fields and
gardens which are the charm and profit of the- valley. Nowhere else
in the world will they find water serving so many purposes.
The committee must be impressed with the relation of climate
to the highest profit of irrigation. The members see all of this in
the San Joaquin Valley, and when they go to inspect the Sacra
mento Valley they will scent the bloom in great orange orchards,
part of that citrus belt that stretches from Kern to Butte County,
and will look upon grain fields, alfalfa meadows, olives, oranges,
figs, walnuts and- almonds, pomegranates and all the stone fruits,
growing together, fertilized by the same water and. promoted by a
climate which makes irrigation more profitable than is possible any
where outside of California. This will stir the. members of Con
gress to an energetic promotion of the complete irrigation of both
sides of the Sacramento Valley, a project that seems colossal in its
scope, but when it is accomplished the results will so fully justify
it that the toil and cost of the work will be forgotten as a sacrifice,
to be remembered as a shrewd business policy.
Meeting the Commonwealth Club, escorted by the manager of
the State Board of Trade and breaking bread with the Water and
Forests Society, the members of Congress will get a lesson in the
harmony of these co-workers in the building of California and will
learn that our own people are fully alive to all the bewildering
possibilities of the State. They are able to instruct the Govern
ment by showing the results of individual and co-operative effort.
The committee is here to learn and these organizations are here
to teach. As for hospitality, it is evident that if the committee sees
what it wants it will not be put to the trouble of asking for it.

The Morgue officers deny that ths
mysterious "corpse" was ever on a slab.
The man who has caused so much ex
citement is in a dazed condition and is
non-cotimittal regarding his experi
ences.
Abe then walked across the street to
the blacksmith chop where off and on -for
twenty years he had been doing casual
work. Here he was greeted with another
burst cf surprise. William Cradock, who
had stated that he had seen him dead on
the slab at the Morgue, was astounded
.beyor.d expression, whiTe young Joseph
Cradock, who had also seen Abe stretched
cold and st:ff, thought the resurrection
day was at hand.
New Abner is well known in the vicin
ity of Devisadero and Fulton streets. In
fact, everybody in that locality is ac
quainted with. his eer.ial countenance. On
Bunds* morning when the news became
noised around that Abner wag dead and
lying ar the liorgue there was grief in all
thaj vicinity. There was a general dis
cussion in that section as to what was the
cause of his death, but that he was dead
&r.d gone forever was an admitted fact.
This was the situation of affairs on
Monday morning, when Abner suddenly
loomed up, alive and well, and walked
into the grocery of Julius Berendsen
tt the corner of Devisadero and Fulton
streets end, throwing a quarter on the
counter, demanded some refreshments.
Now Berendsen is in no way a coward
and can hold his own in any fray and at
any time, but for once in his life he was
perturbed when he saw the supposed dead
man suddenly appear before him. With
a great shout he said, "Why, Abe,
where <JJd you come from?"
Ab* looked up in a sort of dazed con
dition and said. "Well, they may try to
kill me, but I am not dead yec"
Cradock had known Jobneon for twenty
years and he wa; and is now positive
that the body lying at tne Morgue was
Abner Johnbon's.
Abuer Johnson fcae caused no end of a
sensation In the locality of Devisadero
and Fulton streets during the last few
days by his supposed sudden death and
by his equally sudden return to life.
Johnson was well, alive and hearty on
Friday night when he left the black
smith shop of William Cradock at 803
Devjsadero street to go, as he said, down
town. On Saturday afternoon what was
supposed 1 to be the <iead body of Johnson
was found on Golden Gate avenue, near
Jones etxeei. and carried down to the
Morgue. Different friends were called to
look at the remains, one and all pro
nounced the body lying on the marble
Klab to be that cf Abner Johnson. Prom
inent among those to identify the lad
lyinAT on the elab was his late employer,
William Cradock, who. accompanied by
his son Joseph, went to the Morgue Sat
urday night, and there, without hesita
tion, stated that the man lying there In
death's cold embrace was no other than
Abr.T Jchncon.

Deputy Collector Stephens Hold* Out
for Week Monrr Collected From
a Passenger aa Duty.
An investigation of a* minor scandal
in the Custom-house has just been
concluded by Special Treasury Agents
West and Charming, assisted by Au
ditor Cope and Special Deputy William
B. Hamilton. The matter involved the.
holding out of 523 23 for one week by'
Deputy Customs 'Collector Charles
Stephens. .
During 1 the absence of Customs Col
lector Stratton Clerk Behnemann of
the naval office discovered a shortage
of $23 23 in the payments of Stephens
to Cashier Perkins. It was found from
the records that the sum named had
been collected by Stephens from a
passenger, as duty, on his. baggage.
Clerk Behnemann, in obedience to the
rules of the department, reported the
shortage to Cope and Hamilton, Act
ing Collector. Stephens denied to
these officials that he had received
the money. Clerk Behnemann was sent
for. He produced records that con
vinced Mr. Stephens that he had made
a mistake.
"There's nothing in J.he story," said
Collector Stratton yesterday. "It was
all a mistake that the money had not
been turned over by Stephens. It was
only $23, and it was only a week be
fore it was paid in." . ;
It is not expected that anything
further will be done until Washington
shall have been heard from. In the
meantime Deputy Collector Stephens
is still performing his duties.

SOCIETY MAID OF SAN FRANCIS
CO WHO WAS MARRIED IN TO
KOHAMA YESTERDAY.
Far-away Yokohama was yesterday the
scene of a nuptial ceremony of vital in
terest to California, for, though the serv
ices were far from home, all close ties
of the principals lie within our own State
boundary.
Miss Carrie Sweigert, granddaughter of
pioneer and millionaire Adam Sweigert,
plighted her troth to Edward S. Sullivan
in the Yokohama Catholic church.
The bride, whose progenitor was a prime
factor in the upbuilding and history of
Santa Clara County, Is the daughter of
Adam Sweigert Jr.. who likewise was a
pioneer of the oak-grown valley. A
brother Is Charles A. Sweigert, the Demo
cratic orator. E. S. Sullivan, the groom,
holds a responsible position with the
Standard Oil Company, having been at
tached to all the coast's branches of that
corporation, and since January has been
manager of the Oriental station. His du
ties requiring his attention on the other
side for some time to come. Miss Sweig
ert eailed from San Francisco a few
week* ago to meet her fiance and have
the nuptial service celebrated In. the for
eign land.
Eventually Mr. and Mrs. Sullivan will
make their home in San Francisco, but
not until business affairs are well in
shape. Before returning home Mr. Sul
livan willatake his bride for a tour of the
world. *\u2666 :
Commissioner Kilbey, commander of the
Salvation Army forces of the Western
States, has received the following
cablegram from Mr. Bramwell Booth,
chief of staff to : the general, -.William
Booth, London, England, calling upon the
Salvation Army throughout the world to
observe the week from the 10th to the
17th of June as a week of special prayer
and intercession that the present war be
tween Russia and Japan may cease:
Comrades and friends, our beloved general
has cabled 'to. me from Australia requesting
that I will issue on his behalf a call to prayer
for peace. It is my earnest desire, therefore,
that you will observe and I hereby appoint the
week from Saturday, the 10th, to Saturday, the
17th of June, to bÂ« observed aa a time tor spe
cial â¢ Intercession, that . In , his ; infinite mercy
God may be pleaded so to move the hearts of
the rulers and people concerned in this present
war that peace may be restored and his name
may be honored. ' â¢ I cannot do . better ' than
quote the words of a message the general halt
telegraphed to this country: "Every Â«parlc of
real benevolence the world contains pleads for
peace In the spirit of Jesus Christ. The high
est interests of the two nations, the wounded
thousands !n the hospitals, the lonely captlviaj
In the prisons, the very dead in their graves
on land and aeleep in the deep waters, the al
most numberless ' orphans and widows whx>
hopelessly weep, the countless multltudss
doomed to perish if thÂ« slaughter continues,
all groan . together on behalf of peace. Surely
the honor cf Russia and the advantages sought
by Japan must now be satisfied.. In the name
of God and humanity I plead that the powers
of . Europe and America nhall present reasons
for bringing this bloody strife to an immediate
termination. Comrades, whatever may be thÂ«
right method of settling mo disputes cf na
tions, this dreadful hatred and carnage and
desolation cannot be God's way; upon that wÂ«>
must all be agreed." '
Let us then appeal to him to bring it to an
end Bnd let there rise from every army home,
r.ay, from every heart ' in which there is shed
the love of Christ, who died alike for pur dear
brothers of both these great peoples, a cease
lees cry in the heart of God to stretch out his
hand to interpose in his strength to end tlw
strife. I beg that you .will with me Join our
dear general In this work of intercession.

Collector Herman promised to appear
before Foreman Andrews on Tuesday,
but did not keep his word. Yesterday he
informed Andrews that he would not be
interviewed by him. A subpena was
made out for Herman and he will be
forced into testifying before the full
Grand Jury to-morrow.
"Some â¢of the men who have been in
timidated into contributing to 'the
club,' "- said Foreman Andrews, "do not
even know that a club exists. They de
clare that they have been told that they
had better contribute. These are civil
service men, too. who were not put in
by any party. I have heard that In some
instances the heads of their depart
ments have advised them to contribute."
Tha funds that are turned in monthly
to the Schmitz Central Club, according
to estimates made by the Grand Jury
committee, are enormous. Herman will
be forced to produce the books of "the
club" to-morrow and will be questioned
as to his methods of collection and the
purpose for which the money Is being
raised. -
W*. H. Podd, who appeared as a wit
ness against Frank A. Maestrettl. was
dismissed from the service of Phillips &
Van Orden yesterday. He reported the
matter to Foreman Andrews, who is de
termined to ascertain whether the dis
missal was the result of friendship for
the administration. Van Orden is at pres
ent in Europe and Phillips is ill, conse
quently neither could be interviewed yes
terday.
M. Herman, .collector, for ..the .Schmitz
Central Club, has refused to; appear, be^
fore Foreman Andrews of the Grand
Jury. He will be subpenaed to appear
before the meting of -the full Grand Jury
in Judge Lawlor's court to-morrow. .
Reports, have Yeached Foreman An
drews that civil service employes have
been "held up" by Herman for amounts
ranging from 2Â»4 to 5 per cent of their
salaries. The Grand .Jury has as evi
dence receipts from some of these which
are signed by Herman, "assistant secre
tary" of "the club." : -
As far as the investigation has gone it
has been ascertained that every employe
who owes his appointment to the pres
ent administration is taxed for a part
of his' salary for campaign funds. This
has been gfiing on ever since the begin
ning of the Schmitz regime.
During the last week Foreman Andrews
has received many complaints from civil
service employes in municipal offices, who
declare that they 'have been intimidated
into contributing to this fund. They as
sert that they were practically forced
into paying through fear of the heads
of their offices.
William Hogan, an old-time offender,
was captured while committing j bur
glary in the residence of Miss Vanaa
Peterson at 1034 Mission \ street last
night. John Engelhardt, a coaenman
in the employ o(y Dr. Summers, is re
sponsible for the burglar's incarcera
tion, as he followed. the thief through
the house and held him until Officers
Rooney and Crowley arrived. '\
Miss Peterson, who has recently
moved iinto the 1 house, was reading in
one of the rear rooms when a noise
alarmed her. She â¢ opened her door
slightly and 'soon became convinced
that- some one was searching a
number of rooms on the opposite side
of the hallway. Miss .Peterson was the
only one occupying the premises, and
she summoned the assistance of John
Engelhardt, who lives in a small cot
tage in the rear. When Engelhardt
learned that a burglar was on the
premises he bravely came to the aid
of the woman and began* a search' of
the house.
Hogan was found in the k.tcnen.
He had already starched five rooms,
including the room of James Sum
mers, the aged father of Dr. Summers.
The amount stolen is small, from the
fact that most of the rooms had not
been fully furnished by tenants. En
gelhardt called upon the intruder to
halt. Instead of complying Hogan or
dered his Dursuer to etay back and
called out this command: "Stop, or
I'll kill you."
Engelhardt followed â¢ the thief to
the front door/ The latter halted "in
an attempt to release the- fastenings,
and in a moment he was a captive.
Engelhardt then called for Miss Pe
terson and the lauy rushed to the side
walk and blew a police whistle. Pa
trolmen Crowley and Rooney re
sponded, and the burglar was taken
to thÂ« City Prison.

IN TRIM SHAPE AFTER IXhVG VOYAGE. ' . .
It took Johnson but a few seconds to
6rag the stiff and trembling youngsters
from'tneir water-logged skiff and half
an hour later he helped them tie up
the derelict to the sugar refinery wharf
and boosted the juvenile mariners to
the hlg-h dryness of the bulkhead. They
uianked Johnson and disappeared at
full trot In the direction of home and
â¢upper.
But for the timely appearance on the
ecene of Harry Johnson In his gasoline
launch two more young lives would
have been blotted out Tuesday night in
the waters of the bay. Johnson was
returning about 8 o'clock from Hunters
Point. Above the choo-choo of the
launch exhaust he heard the whimper
of a child's voice. He listened and over
the waters came faintly the sound of
eobblng. He slowed down and headed
the boat in the direction of the signals
of distress. The shades of darkness
were already thick and a bitter wind
'was raising whitecaps on the fast flow
ing flood tide.
Early in the evening James Lantry
and Thomas Moore, 10 and 11 years of
agÂ«, respectively, had started out from
Buteiiertown on a fishing excursion.
Their boat was a weather-worn skiff.
It had been great fun at first, but all
the Joy died when they discovered that
rowing back against the current was a
task beyond their strength. Then an
car slipped from the tired fingers and
the little navigators were left with only
one paddle. The wind freshened and
the little whltecaps began to toss top
knots over the skiffs gunwale. It was
not long until the boat was half filled
with water. Cold and scared, the boys
sobbed into the night a plea for help.
And then came the choo-choo of the
launch's exheust. Â»

THE; SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY. JUNE 15^ 1905.
Senators Perkins and Flint
Have Tiiue to Discuss
the Federal Appointments
NO SIGN OF SHAKE -UP
Indications That the Present
Eegime Will Continue
in Service of the Public
There is talk in political camps that
Senators Perkins and Flint, while do
ing escort duty for the Congressional
Committee on Irrigation, will take
time aboard the train to discuss topics
connected with the award of Federal
patronage In California. It is known
that Senator Flint is not inclined to
invade the field in Central and North
ern California over; which the senior
Senator has exercised a sort of sov
ereignty for many years. â¢ It is fancied
that Senator Flint in return for this
indulgence will be monarch of all he
surveys in the region south of Te
hachapi.. . ,\ r v i.;;;?*
Politicians are predicting that a rum
pus will sooner or later take place be
tween the Senate and the President.
In the event of such, proceeding the
Senators who elect to stand by the
chief executive through thick and thin
will hold a commanding position at the
pie counter. It is common gossip that
the junior Senator from California has
resolved to go the whole route with
President Roosevelt on any policy
which the latter may adopt. It is said
that the senior Senator may find it em
barrassing to break away from the tra
ditions of the Senate and the fellow
ship of Senators. A dilemma from
which Senator Perkins could not emerge
serene and smiling has yet to be pre
sented on the stage of politics, hence
the old-timers assert that he will man
age some way to come. out ahead.
There may be a few changes in the
Federal office-holding staff in Califor
nia, but a general shake-up is not ex
pected. It is commonly supposed that
Robert T. Devlin was appointed
United States Attorney and Fred S.
Stratton reappointed Collector of Cus
toms in order to strengthen the Per
kins machine." The Postmaster who
was a candidate for United States Sen
ator, and is mentioned as an aspirant
for Governor, is counted as a hard and
fast supporter of Perkins. Joseph tS.
Spear, Surveyor. of Customs: John T.
Dare. Appraiser; Julius Jacobs, Sub-
Treasurer: Frank A. Leach. Super.n
tendent-of the Mint: - : John P. Irish,
Naval Officer; John C. Lynch, Revenue
Collector; John H. Shine, United
States Marshal, and Charles Bassett,
Shipping Commissioner, entertain the
opinion at the present time that Sena
tor Perkins has, rendered the State
distinguished service, therefore it is
surmised that the Senator is satisfied
with the situation, although an expres
sion from the Federal brigade to me
effect that Victor H. Metcalf could dp
no better, than' Perkins has done may
be . reauested later on. '*-.;.-\u25a0.â¢:\u25a0

Evans Is Sent to Build , Tip
j Local Commerce in the

PLAN NEW DEPAETUKE
San Francisco's Exporters
Are to Compete Against
the British and Germans
. The Pacific Commercial Museum has
commissioned J. W." Evans, its secre
tary, to go on;a tour" of Central and
South American .countries \u25a0 and also
to all the Seaports of Mexico^ on the
Pacific Coast in ' the interests of the
commerce of San Francisco. He will
depart on tlie . next steamer for the
south, which Isscheduled to leave next
Saturday. Important results are ex
pected from inquiries that Mr. Evans
is to make and the information that he
will be prepared to impart to the coun
tries to which he goes.
Commercial houses that do an,ex
porting business in San Francisco have
furnished Mr. Evans with their cata
logues, showing what they can offer in
the Central and; South American mar
kets in competition with Germany .'and
Great Britain, which now have a large
commercial hold" south of the United
States. ; These catalogues are printed
in both Spanish and. English and con
tain price lists v and descriptive matter.
It will be the duty of Mr. Evans to
present s and explain all the advantages
that San Francisco possesses as an ex
porting point and to try to enlist in
terest in San Francisco. His mission
will probably, keep him abroad at least
seven months. If he is as successful
as the Commercial Museum's directors
believe,: he will' be, arrangements will
be made to maintain a -permanent rep
resentative in the southern countries
in the Interest of San* Francisco's com
merce. .
Secretary Evans has been engaged in
exporting and has been in nearly every
commercial port in the world in a busi
ness capacity. .The work the Commer
cial Museum is now' undertaking is
new for.it, but the members, commer
cial hourtes or : individuals engaged in
business, hope for large benefits from
the venture. ' .

Heirs of the late John Fay. once a
State Senator, are endeavoring in Judge
Coffey's court to determine how much
of his property was community prop
erty and how much, If any, was accu
mulated by him prior to his marriage.
Several witnesses," Including a brother
of the deceased, testified that when he
married he was compelled to rent a. lit
tle home, not having sufficient funds
with which to build one, *uid they gave
It as their opinion that all of his estate,
.\u25a0which is of considerable value, was ac
cumulated, by him after his marriage.
If this contention is upheld by the
court his widow will get one-half of
his estate and the other half will be
distributed among other relatives." .
Fay's Estate In Question.
Tragedy seems to be the predominant
hue in the life of Sarah A. Tracy, who
killed herself yesterday morning at her
residence, 124 Plymouth street. Ocean
View, by swallowing carbolic add.
On December 23 of last year her 20
yc-ar-old daughter. May Tracy, was suffo
cated by illuminating gas in the Prescott
House, Kearny street. She and a girl
named Nellie Lanigan, alias Johnson, en
gaged a room shortly after 6 o'clock in
the evening. They were very much un
der the Influence of liquor and at & o'clock
in the morning they were. found dead in
bed, the gas escaping from a partly
opened burner. The girl had lived with
h^r mother at Ocean View. Her father,
Thomas Tracy, who gave his address as
2]33 San Jose avenue, paid the funeral ex
penses.
About two weeks ago a young English
men named Wilson, who had been living
in .the same house with Mrs. Tracy,
killed himself with carbolic acid Just over
the line In San Mateo County. It was
reported at the time that he and Mrs.
Tracy had been accused by Mr. Tracy of
having been on too Intimate terms.
Remorse la assigned as the reason for
Mrs. Tracy's suicide.
Domestic Scandal and Death
of Daughter Prey Upon
3Ers. Tracy.
WOMAN ENDS HER LIFE
BECAUSE OF REMORSE
The nurses in attendance have fears
for her reason. All night long she cries
for her sons, and again Imagines them to
be alive and with her. Trembling and
pale she begged to be allowed to view the
belongings of her sons yesterday and
when a realization carac upon her that
probably they wc.ild never come to claim
the possessions of their, youth she lost
control of her mind and ..was stricken
worse than at any previous time.
It -was late in the evening when the
father first knew of the accident, and.
h errying to the worried mother, he told
her of the overturning of the little crab
boat in which their sons went .jailing.
Mis. Mohr could not be comforted. She
hoped against hope that the boys had
reached shore and would be picked up
the next day.
Aiter being assured that the com
panions to the tragedy had seen Alfred
Mohr sink in a vain effort to ewim .iway
from the frail craft Mrs. Mohr ex
pressed a hope that Edwin was rescued
by soinÂ« seagoing vessel that could not
put back to port, and now in deiirium
she cries for him to come home to her
alive.
Oscar Mohr came up- from Fresno to
Join the search and he is scouring the
hay now in a launch trying to gather evi
dence that the bodies were swept ashore.
Every cove and inlet has been investi
gated, but without a clew. The tide was
racing out to sea at the time the boat
â¢was overturned, and the bodies must
have been carried far to the west.
When the sorrowful event was first
told in the household Mrs. Mohr and her
husband were dining out, accompanied
by their little son Harold. Nothing had
been heard of the boys all < day,, and as
it waa oast the usual time If or their ar
rival from the yachting trip Miss Flor
ence Mohr tried to telephone to the !>oat
house.
Four daj*s have passed since the drown
ing or her two sons, and 6tlll the mother
of Edwin and Alfred Mohr lies pros
trated at the Van Ness avenue home,
heedless of the comforting words of
friends. Ever since the news of their
death in the bay was told on Sunday
her mind has been dazed, and all the ex
pressions of condolence which friends
and relatives have given do not assuage
the grief of the heart-broken mother.
"With a forlorn hope the Mohrs waited
ell through Sunday night for assuring
reports that the accident was not fatal.
"With the morning came the intelligence
of a fruitless search by lifeboats along
the Maria shore, Willing friends put to
Bea in an endeavor to pick up Edwin, as
It was often told In the Mohr home of the
feats of swimming which he had per
formed. The parents clung to the hope
that he had reached shore and was wait-
Ing for some life-savins craft to find
him.

Wounded Man Is in Critical
Condition jind Police Take
Ante - Mortem Statement
Fred C. Jaiser, a painter living at 1231
Mission street, is the man who shot
Charles Buelna, a hodcarrier, in a saloon
at Ninth and Mission streets shortly after
midnight yesterday He was arrested
in his room by, Pollcamen Patrick
Sullivan. Harry Segulns and W. P. Mon
ahan. A revolver of large caliber was
found In the room and, burled in sand
in thÂ« cellar, was found another revolver
of (smaller caliber and two cartridges.
This latter weapon had been used .by
Jaiser In shooting Buelna.
Jaiser at first denied that he fired the
shots, but later admitted to Detective
Whitaker, who waa detailed on the case,
that he waa the shooter. He claimed
that Buelna attacked him and struck him
several times and he fired the shots In
self defense". He would not admit, how
ever, that he left the saloon and went to
his room to get the revolver,' saying that
he had the weapon with him all the time.
The prisoner was taken to the Central
Emergency Hospital by Whitaker. accom
panied by Assistant Bond and Warrant
Clerk Louis Ward, and Buelna. believing
that he was going to die. made an ante
mortem statement and identified Jaiser
as the man who shot him. The surgeons
at the hospital say that Buelna is in a
critical condition.
It eeetns that Buelna entered the sa
loon about midnight and drank a glass
of beer. He left, returning in a few min
utes with Jaiser, Thomas J. Sullivan and
Dick Seglken. They began to quarrel
about paying for drinks anu Buelna hit
Jaiser on the nose. Jaiser left and re
turned in about ten minutes, renewing
the quarrel with Buelna. Jaiser pulled
the revolver from his pocket and fired
three shots at Buelna, one of the bullet 3
entering his body on the left side of the
abdomen. Jaiser hurried out of the sa
loon and Buelna followed him to the door
and fell. The ambulance was summoned
and Buelna was taken to the hospital.

LONDON, June. 14. â Money was in falr.de-'
mar.d to-day. All the arrivals of foreign gold
are expected , to : go .to the Bank of England.
Trading on the Stock Exchange opened dull
and with an uncertain tone. Operations were
narrow. There was a s'.lght rally at midday
on a rumor that General - Llnevitch had "sur
rendered." - but the 'market concluded this
should read "surrounded." The absence of
support resulted In a disposition to 6ag. Con
sols started easy and .lmuroved. . t - 'â¢"\u25a0â¢
Americans opened weak and afterward had
a letter tendency, but the public was In
different and the movements were slight and
mixed. Prices eased later on New York sell
ing, recovered durtrg the last hour and closed
, firm. United States -Steel preferred- closed
*at 97. - Foreigners were Irregular. â¢ Japanese
were fairly steady. --. Imperial- Japanese Govern
ment (is of 19CH were quoted at 103V4. â¢
reeming proEress made In these matters Is
Illusory- This nnds expression In the opinion
quoted from foreign observers that neither of
the present belligerents has any Immediate
"hop* of peace as an outcome of the present
reg-otlatlon*. In the Equitable Life matter
the presentation of the report of the State
Superintendent of Insurance is awaited.
.Vo further steps In tbe plan seem to be
intended until the report appears and judg
ment on the efficacy and finality plan seems
to atrnlt the same event. The importance at
tached to theze matters is due perhaps to
lack of any other obvious explanation -of the
intense stagnation in the market. Weather
conditions were reported favorable to-day for
the crops, but the stock market Is not yet
ready to resr>cnd to to-day'e developments In
thÂ« crop tltuatlon. The stocks which showed
cr.y apprec' ab '* movement to-day were' those
\u25a0R-hich are readiest tr> respond to an impulse In
any direction owinr to the remnant of profes
sional j-ptculatlve interest retained in them."
Canadian Pacific was responsive to such . con
tfUJon*. Reading had ' some help , from the
fevora.fcl<s conditions reported in the anthracite
T-j-d'. " Old rumors of mysterious developments
to come regsrdirg ITnion Pacific were revived.
Tho New York Central statement of net earn
ings for the June quarUr. partly estimated,
was received with satisfaction, the balance In
favor of dividends showing aa Increase of over
SUS per ceot for the corresponding quarter of
â¢art year. The collapse In ; Steel Foundries
rrc'enxd was of little effect. . Tbe dull ad
vtaoe* of the day were well maintained and
tli- closing was fairly steady.
The ptrei-.gth and activity of tbe Japanese
4Us made the feature of the bond market,
which was otherwise dull and Irregular. Total

KESV TORK. June 14.â The dead level of
dullness in to-day's stock market was not re
lieved by any noticeable increase of Interest.
The professional traders, who look to a, move
ment of prices as a medium for earning their
daily bread, tried during the morning to ex
tend yesterday's decline. They eacceeded In
wiping out tbe opening advances which had
be*n made Jn sympathy with the firmer ton*
of the London market, but at that point the
narrow dimensions of the market again 'as
rerted themselves. It v.aa eeen that the im
mediate uelling requirements had been met
la yesterday** market and trader* . thereupon
worked for as advance. As .they had tbe
msrket to thernwlves. they met witn some suc
cess. This did not signalize any Important
development regarding tne stocks which moved
Jn the general situation. Yesterday's market
was accepted as a demonstration that noV. new
Interest In stocks could be looked for as a
result .of the pe&cÂ« prospects or of thÂ«
Equitable Life settlement. Developments re
garding these subjects were therefore followed
with rfither languid Interest. TherÂ« Is some
dispopition. however, to consider that tbe

Hay quotations remain. unchanged. Several
cars of the first cutting of -new Alfalfa came
In "yesterday and "were offered on the market
at $ts, with no sales. ,
The circular of Somers ft. Co., says: -.
'â¢Receipts of -Hay show some. little dlminu-"
tlon from the. total of last week, but 2300 tons
having arrived, In cempartson- with 2500 tons
for. the week p'recedlng. , Of thcae total ship
ments not more than two or three., cars have
been new crop Hay. From the experience of
about ten days ago shippers' have learned that
the market Is hardly. in shape for new Hay
an yet. for .what has been marketed has beÂ«*n
absolutely neglected. Old crop has been cominK
in in sufficient i supply for all demands, anil
the situation shows no change in any -way.
Reports from the country are to the -effect
that practically -the entire new crop \u25a0 is of
rather poor; quality, 'all" Hay containing any
oat showing considerable rust. It la difficult
to foretell Just how matters -will go here dur
ing the next two or three . months, for every
thlns will depend: on the amount of Hay
shipped here. ThÂ« crop Is undoubtedly large,
but choice Hay may rule very nrm because of
Its ' comparative scarcity. " â¢ "
"NowTthat there :is talk of peace' in- tho
Orient we may find a market for both Hay
and Grain in Manchuria, for the report comes
to us that that country is entirely bare of fod
deri -This af present is the only encouraging
matter in sight for our San Francisco markets.
The Government purchased its 'last lot of hay
at Seattle, ; and is now advertising for. another
cargo from that same point. '

CHICAGO, June 14.â Weakness In the wheat
market was In evidence from the start. Not
withstanding higher prices'- at T Liverpool In
itial quotations here showed . losses. July be
ing down a shade at 80% c. The main factor
from the situation was the continuation of
excellent weather conditions... While there
were elight rains in different portions of the
Southwest the precipitation was not sufficient
to delay harvesting. The area of operations
was said to be. exceedingly rapid. In . the
Northwest weather was favorable 'for the de
velopment of spring wheat. Crop reports
were contldent and had a tendency to greatly
restrict the volume of business. Trading was
confined mainly to pit traders. ..Weakness.be
came . more pronounced as \u25a0_ the seselon ad
vanced a slump at Minneapolis having a
dt- pressing effect here. For July the lowest
point. was reached at \u25a0S6@-BÂ«Hc- â¢- The .-market
closed weak, with July down %@%c at BbVÂ«c
Sentiment in the . corn pit was decidedly
bearish. A ' number of factors entered into
the situation to account for the selling pres
sure. One of the main â¢â Influences. â¢ however,
wag the liberal acceptance by farmers of bids
sent out by cash houaes.--->ln addition receipts
were larger than estimated â¢ and- the shipping
demand showed signs of a betterment. The
market closed at the lowest point of the day;
July V'>c down at 52& c. - . .
Oats were weak, In sympathy with other
grains. July, closed %@fcc lower : at .30%
Provisions were , a trifle easier as a result
of the weakness of corn. A fair demand '.from
packers fcr lard, however, prevented any ma
terial decline.^ At ;Uie close September \u25a0 porJi

The fruit market Is in very, bad shape, the

a result there Is a heavy accumulation of stock,

Deciduous and Citrus Fruits.
The annual circular of Tlllman & Bendel
to the trade cays:
"The unusual conditions end circumstance*
attending the packing and marketing of Corn
and Tomatoes for tbe year 1904 were Â«uch as to
ratber discourage retailers In making large
contracts for this season; en the other hand.
they profited by these contracts for several
, yecrs Immediately preoeding. We, therefore.
considering the present changed conditions, do
not hesitate to recommend dealers to place
their orders at prices we quote under our guarÂ«
entee agalnut decline. Our guarantee to pro
tect prices against any decline we may make
before the dose of the canning season Insures
the dealer aralnet loss and protects as well
6* gives him the advantÂ£Â«e of any advance
In the market. By studying the prices it will
be noted that Corn and Tomatoes, which after
all' are the principal items, are this season
being offered at prices co close to the coet of
production as to make them unprofitable to
pack except to those canners who use modern
ar.d labor-saving devices, and who have an
outlet for a large pack. It does not eeem
possible that a small packer can exist on the
margin left In the prices being aeked at
present. With theao facts, the advisability of
purchasing futures at this time must be left
to the rood Judgment or those Interested; and
in this connection we might point out In pass-
Ing the fact that those who have placed their
orders for Asparagus have already profited
handsomely.
"Taken as a whole, the crop of Calif orcia.
fruits is below the average; although the fa
vorable condition of the Apricot and Peach
crop has enabled packers to name somewhat
lower prices on thece varieties.
"As is cur custom we have gathered accu
Â£ate information and go somewhat into detail
in our resume of crop conditions.
"Apricots â Are in plentiful supply and most
Â«xc*!lcnt In quality, having been affected
neither by frost nor scale.
â¢"Peaches â Are expected to yield a good crop.
although the quantity will not be up to early
expectations. In point of quality there is little
room lor comnlalnt.
"Pearsâ Have again been affected by blight
to such an extent that even higher prices than
last year are bfir.gr asked. Growers fortunate
enough to be situated in districts free from
bUght are asking almost prohibitory prices for
their fruit. The total crop will be about 60
per cent of the normal.
"Cherriesâ Are almost an absolute failure,
. due to late rains Just at the time when the
fruit was ready to be picked. and packed. Were
it not for the fact that canners have a liberal
cerr7 over, they would not be in pcsltton to
iHer ary at this time.
"Berries and Plums â Will probably pield a
ffcir crcp without much change In prioes.
' "Asptirague â Unfavorable weather conditions,
the ravsges of rust and a species of centipede,
â¢Scolto Per.drella. 1 are responsible, for the dis
appointing Asparagus pack At the opening
of the season conditions seemed most favor
able for satisfactory results, but as the time
aprreached when the stock should be in con- '
di-ion for canning it was found that the stalks
were few and far between. Present Indications
are that packers will deliver about 50 per
cent of their orders.
"Cora â Present \u25a0 conditions are not very
"bright for a large pack, although It is a little
early to accurately prophesy the outcome. In
lowa the weather has been bo cold and it has
been Â«o rainy that but little seed was planted
until very Uu. This late planting -will surely
make a late season unless tbe weather turns
lavcrable from now en. Although . last year"s
crop was a bumper one, we feel safe in stat
ing that the bulk of the goods packed will
have gone Into consumption by the time, the
new poods are available â this being due to the
extremely low price wjiich has ruled on epot
Etock..
â¢â¢Tomatoesâ Although the acreage planted
\u25a0warrants the prediction that the coming pack
will not bÂ« as great as that of last year, tbe
price is affected by the carry over, which is
quite large. The fignres namfd on this Item
leave packers wipiout a profit. As a conse
quence, unless the season is a moat favorable
one bs to climatic conditions it is more than
likely than higher prices will rule later on.
"Peas â The acreage exceeds that of former
years, but the cold weather ha 6 reduced the
crop considerably and has cot down the quan
tity packed, especially the low grades. While
the pack to date has not reached the figure*
estimated earlier in the season, .the qualltjv
is exceptionally fine, and packers who have
sold heavily are considering the advisability
of advancing prices or withdrawing from the
market, notably on the lower grades."

may do a great deal toward -establishing, re

ing, the very harmful- abuses, sow existing In

adopting, thÂ« ! Elgin < quotation -as the standard
every. day. plus the usual charges for freight,

gued, controls the markets all over the rest 'of

method of placing the daily quotations, on 'an
official and reliable basis would be a. vast im

L.*BAVES FOR THE EAST.â The Rev. Em
ma,P. Bauder of , this city, one of the fore
most \u25a0 Prohibition 'workers of the Pacific Coast,
has Just left for the East to attend the first
General Council of Woman's Prohibition Clubs
of .America, . of which she has been elected
chairman.*,-'" The' convention .will be . held 'at
Chicago on ' June 21 and 22. On the closing
day ' Mrs. Bauder will-, deliver an address on
.'-'Woman's Struggles In the World's Reforms."
S. E. R. de Smidt, who was indicted
by the Federal Grand Jury , with W. J.
; Wood, W. <J. Woodside and J R. J. Tyson
for conspiring to v catch ; seals In violation
of the law,' surrendered ;himself. to the
Federal â¢ authorities yesterday.
He ; did \u25a0', not leave with [ Captain Alex
ander McLean; on' the last- cruise to. the
Bering Sea, as was at first believed by'
Secret Service Agent Harry. Moffltt. but
has been In this city for several , months.
l>e Smidt. like; the others accused with
him, was . released on {3000 bonds. 7 ' "
â¢ Meanwhile ' the daredevil McLean, now
a pirate according to International law, is
roving through the ' Bering Sea In quest
of . more sealskins. The revenue cutter
Bear is hurrying northward to meet him
and the Rush -will pYobably leave for the
Bering before many. days. .'â¢\u25a0
..Shortly after the Russian- Japanese war
began the American . Government under
took the protection' of -the sealing in
dustry in the north. = Consequently it is
up to the Federal authorities to stop the
depredations of " McLean. Moreover, Mc-
Lean is now declared a pirate, who must
betaken dead or alive,"- preferably dead.
While those who are accused of back
ing him are under the surveillance of the
Federal authorities, McLean is on the
Carmencita in auest of. loot and excite
ment.. He is, laughing at law and Gov
ernments." Those who I know him say; he
can' well afford to laugh. Every time 'rie
came here he told weird tales of blood
and strife In \ northern seas to . Interested
audiences" in water front barrooms. In
fair or unfair fight McLean could not be
beat, according to shipping men here, and
he is the sort of man to meet any ruse
with a shrewder one.
The seas that the seals inhabit are
open book to '-\u25a0 him. The tales run that
.McLean was wont. to raid a seal rookery
in' the Bering or loot a warehouse, then
put about and run for some Japanese
port. There he would tarry and with ills
crew of freebooters spend riotous nights
with the geishas. and consume gallons of
sake.
Russian and Japanese gunboat, Ameri
can; revenue .cutterâ he defied. them : . all.-
By ruse or bluff or. open fight he has held
the representative of the law at bay for
years. ...
De Smidt is charged with . having been
with McLean on the Carmencita when
he crept into the harbor at Copper Island
in â¢ the fog and 7 attempted to rob the
rookeries. The natives ... opened fire on
him and a bloody battle in the fog cn r
sued. McLean and his freebooters were
finally driven off. , .
The Federal Government Is determined
that this shall be McLean's last cruise.
If he is captured alive McLean may be
hanged for piracy on the high seas.

Bdthe'S; report will be the initial step
toward insuring the sale of pure drugs
and establishing , the requirement that
any drug shall not be sold under misrep
resentation. The Health Board intends to
pursue ? its inquiries into all compounds
of a like character and startling devel
opments are promised in that line.
Bothe. in his report, will make the- dec
laration that the nostrum mentioned con
tains sulphuric acid which, while also re
garded as a destroyer of germs, is not jto
be allowed by the health officials to en
ter the human stomach.
Besides its active crusadÂ» against the
prevailing practice of adulterating food
stuffs, the Board of Health Is at present
busy making bacteriological examinations
of. drugs and medicines with a view to
ward v securing their absolute purity.
Dr. A>. C. Bothe, head of the bacterio
logical department,' will at to-day*Â» meet
ing of the board submit a partial report
of his investigations in that connection.
It is stated by the health officials that
certain compounds dispensea for the al
leged cure of many ills will be driven
from; the market owing to their deleteri
ous composition as ascertained by Bothe
upon his analysis.
A nostrum which is advertised to kill
all the germs and microbes to which hu
man flesh Is subject will be among the
medicinal preparations reported against
by Dr. Bothe. This nostrum is repre
sented by the manufacturers as being
composed of ingredients which, in com
bined state, are sure death to the ba
cilli which are said by medical experts
to cause all sorts of diseases.

The Board of Works blames the-Su-.
pervisors * for { delaying, , action, which
will, result in the transfer of the money
set aside :for the improvements to next
year's unappropriated 'fund and render
it unavailable.
The Board of Works yesterday
adopted a caustic resolution request-^
Ing the Board of Supervisors to state
its intentions regarding the. pavement
of Fourth . street and the grading and
macadamizing of"- H \u25a0' street, * and what
disposition it intends to make of the
money appropriated for that purpose,
also to inform the' Board ,' of Public
Works why "it : has* not .responded to
the communication in reference to the
improvements of the streets. The reso
lution also requests, the Board of Su
pervisors to pass a resolution instruct
ing the Auditor to; keep * intact the
money appropriated for the purposes
named so that it-can be used for what
it was originally intended. <
â¢It was also developed that the busi
ness of effecting leases has. grown in
importance very greatly. ' TheY State
Legislature at its last session Increased
the legal, time limit for which leases
may be made from twenty-flve: to fifty
years. This; served to increase" the
volume of business, many, parties wish
ing to get long time leases who would
not be satisfied to erect costly improve
ments for comparatively short periods!
Afterthe subject. had been thorough
ly, discussed the board voted in favor of
a schedule of : uniform rates. All real
estate brokers In" the city will be re
quested to conspicaously post " the rates
agreed upon in their offices for the gen
eral Information of . the public. -The
rates arÂ«v 2 Jfl percent of the first year's
rent arid 1 M per cent for each year
thereafter. .
He said that he had noticed that a
brick apartment-house was in course
of erection- on the southeast corner of
Fell and Franklin streets, which is in
the route of the proposed extension of
the park panhandle as favored by
Architect Burnham. who is devising a
plan for the adornment and improve
ment of San Francisco.
If Mathias Johnson, the owner of the
building, expends $75,000 on the struc
ture, said Mr. Phelan, there will be
$75,000 more for the city to invest
when It buys the route from Van Ness
avenue to Baker street. Mr. Phelan
said that: he had also noticed a new
brick building immediately back of the
one owned by Johnson. In his opinion
some organization of San Francisco
ought to be concerned in notifying
property owners that the park pan
handle extension is in view. The San
Francisco Real Estate Board would
seem to be the proper body' to take
the lead in the matter.
On. motion of John T. Harmes it was
voted to refer the matter to the direc
tors of the board, with instruction to
report at a special meeting. President
Howell at once called .the meeting for
Wednesday of next week at 8 p. m.
The other matter of importance to
be considered was a report by a spe
cial committee regarding a schedule of
uniform charges to . be made on term
leases of realty./. Such schedule was
favored by the committee. A discus
sion, took place, in which the speakers
were President Howell and Messrs.
Stern, Speck, Harmes and John C.
Boardman. Several reasons were given
to show â¢ the necessity pt the proposed
schedule. One was that under existing
conditions, when a "controversy regard
ing a ' lease "gets into courts- there Is
nothing "to show a rule in reference to
rates/ Another was that much trouble
is unnecessarily occasioned by "shop
ping" in rates on leases, parties in in
terest going from one brokerage of
fice to another to find lower, terms. .
Two matters of importance came\be
fore the San Francisco Real Estate
Board at a meeting yesterday. James
D. Phelan, president of the Association
for the Adornment of San Francisco,
brought up the one of leading interest.
In view of the intense public feeling
arouse by the murder, of Schultze, Mur
phy at one time intended asking for a
change of venue to another county, be
lieving that the defendant would not get
& fair and impartial trial here. If he had
not wituurawn from the case It is prob
able that Le would have urged the point.
When the case was first called in Judge
Lawlor's court Attorney Murphy stopped
the proceedings by applying to: the. United
States Circuit Court for a writ of habeas
corpus for Scherfs release on a consti
tutional ground In connection with the
Grand Jury. Judge Morrow denied the
writ and Murphy took an appeal to the
United States Supreme Court, which has
now sustained the Circuit Court. "
Scherf was driver of the pound wagon
Â«.nd on August 24 last he shot and killed
Rndolph W. Schultze on Fifth avenue
ecuth. The poundmen had captured a pet
dog belonging to Schultze-s daughter and
Schultze hurried from his work to save
the animal, j During the strugjgle It Is al
leged that Scherf fatally shot Schultze.
He was indicted by the Grand Jury on a
charge of murder. --- \u25a0 *".
Gustave Scherf, on the eve of his trial
for murder, has been left without an at
torney to represent him. When the case
was called for trial yesterday morning in
Judge Lawlor's Court Attorney Frank J/
Murphy said he had notified the defend
ant and his mother by letter that he had
withdrawn from the case and he asked
that his withdrawal be placed on the rec
ord. This was^done and the Judge asked
