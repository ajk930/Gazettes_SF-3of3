have not only assured his Majesty- that
the army was never, in better.: condition,
but they have sent messages .to "Mr. 7<le

They demand an opportunity to retrieve
the honor and prestige of the army,", arid,

LIXEVITCH YEARNS FOR BATTLE.
The Japanese, as usual, are very
reticent and it is impossible to obtain
from them the least Indication of
their view of the change In the situa
tion produced by the President's ac
tion. It is taken for granted that the
President's appeal was made to Japan
as well as to Russia,- but the Japanese
side of the negotiations looking to a
compromise is almost completely in
the dark. The Japanese view of the
Situation Is authoritatively, but rather
fcuznorously, stated thus:
. "Tue result will be known soon. It
Jis as useless to speculate as it would
be for the plenipotentiary to give his
opinion of the sex of the unborn In

municated to his chief the Pr^ident's

Emperor, together with Mr. de Wltte'a
recommendation. No clew to the nature
of this recommendation has been revealed,
but It can be said that Mr. de Witte, no
matter how he personally may view the
proposition. Is distinctly pessimistic as to
the character of the -response which will
come from St. Petersburg. To a confi
dential friend this afternoon he offered
little hope of a change In the situation.
The Japanese, it is firmly believed,
cling to the substance of the form of
their demand for remuneration for "the
cost of the war." Perhaps they are
â¢willing to decrease the sum asked, but
substantial compensation, under what
ever guise it is obtained, they decline

was proposed by the President cannot be
stated definitely. The only thins that can
be affirmed positively is tnat If Russia
refuses to act upon the suggestion or
proposition of President Roosevelt the
peace conference will end In failure.
The ultimate decision of the issue has,
dc facto if nof de jure, passed from the
plenipotentiaries to their principalsâ from
Portsmouth * to . St. Petersburg, and, per
haps, in a lesser extent, to Tokio. Al
though there are collateral evidences that
pressure both by President Roosevelt and
neutral powers, including Japan's ally.
Great Britain, Is still being ex
erted in Tokio to Induce Japan
to moderate her demands, there Is
also reason to believe that President

PORTSMOUTH, Aug. 20.â The chances

PORTSMOUTH, N. H., Aug. 20.â The
feature of the proposition of Presi
dent Roosevelt, communicated through
Baron Rosen to Mr. de Witte and by
the latter to Emperor Nicholas, was
based on the principle of arbitration.
Whether the President contemplates
arbitration of all of the articles on
which the plenipotentiaries have failed
to agree or only on the question of in
demnity cannot be stated with posl
tiveness, but it is more than probable
that it relates only to Indemnity or to
indemnity and the cession of the island
of Saghallen. : "
To Emperor Nicholas, the author of
The Hague peace conference, the sug
gestion of arbitration, which "will
corfJmand the sympathy of public opin
ion of the world, will be particularly
hard to reject Japan, If she has not
already done so, will be all the more
bound to submit her claim to the- de
cision of an impartial arbitrator.
Acceptance by both sides would In
volve a great extension of the prin
ciple, of arbitration, as nations have
heretofore declined to arbitrate ques
tions involving their "honor and dig
nity."

Personally, as an anti-milltariEt and a be
lieve* .ia peace. 1 find that -it . would .be in
tr.tire conformity to the dignity of Russia to
submit the questions in dispute to The Hague
tribunal and thus increase th* splendor of that
institution. But I know, also, that such an
idea has not yet taken deep enough root., One,
then, cannot feel resentment against, the Rus
sian people if. observing that their love for
peace has been interpreted as a sign of weak
ness and too much is demanded of them, they
replace their destinies in the hands of their
generals.
The player has the right to his revenge. The
world cannot b* angry when Russia, after hav
ing yielded, perhaps, mere than ehe ought,
now says: "If my adversary does not unoer
stand that 1 have yielded unwillingly only be-
OÂ£.us<? 1 have always believed in the peaceful
solution of conflicts, I win prove to him that,
ence wounded. I can become obstinate and
pursue the game until my adversary is com
pletely exhausted."

PORTSMOUTH. N. H.. Aug. 20.âBry
ant Chaninoff, correspondent of the St.
Petersburg Slovo, who is in , close
touch with the members of the Rus
sian mission, made the following sig
nificant statement to-night:
Now that wÂ« are on the eve of the decisive
day when we are to ccc whether higher civil
ization, wedded to peace. Is to come out
victorious or will admit itself incapab.e of
find:ng a Just 6olutlon uf the problem Â«.t
Portsmouth a*d will refer the whole issue
back again to the arbitrament of the sword,
I kin more than ever content that I do not
belong to the Government and can cay aft a
simple Russian citizen that Russia wishes
\u25a0ptac* very sincerely, very frankly, and. that
she considers that she has demonstrated her
desire for peace by her course aj. thl6 confer
ence. She has yielded on fight points. She
fcas abandoned her dream of an open port In
the Pacific. She has aeretd to retire from
the country where she has spent millions in the
cause o' civilization. ' .
All this Â«he has doae, not because BhÂ« fcara
& continuation of the wax; on the contrary, let
ters I have received from Russia are unani
mous In saying that the whole country has re
newed confidence in Its reorganiitd army; that :
the army is thirsting for battle and di earns |
only of revenge; that General Linevltch, tha ;
commander-in-chief. is cure of success, and !
that the authorities will agree in saying that
never before has the moral and physical
strength cf the troops been better.
We know that Linevlich is not only an or
ranizer. like Kuropatkin. but that he possesses
tr.a.t particular military intuition, that talent
for spontaneously seizing an opportunity, wiucn
alone c*n give victory against an adversary
as formidable as the Jaoanese. The number of
Russian troops at lers-t equals those of Japan
and they are no longer Siberian recruits.
I know ihat. in the eyes of ail foreigners, all
these arguments are not convincing. The evenU
of the j'B-st influence their Judgment as to the
future, but to Russians, who arc in touch witb
the military situation, it is certain that a rup
ture of the negotiations* is deemc-d detlrab.e,
because they believe that the turn of the
tide is at hand. Certainly, with a battle al.n;
a front of tixty miles, no one can foresee what
may happenâ Â«ny little accident, - the eun jor
the dust in the eyes of the men. an order bad
ly expressed or badly understood, a w-lephone
wire cut. anything may in an initanfentlie.y
change the situation. One cannot, be. aston
ished, therefore, if the Russians, when tfcey
are told. "You have lost; pay." reply, "Fif
teen lines in succession we nave backed the
red and it has come black. We now have
the advantage of the chance. We will continue
to back the red until we win."
RUSSIA HOPES FOR VICTORY.

â¢ "August 19 will be recorded- in his

The principal objection raised to the

The issue will not necessarily be de

likely that there will be some delay in
the answer from St. Petersburg. In which
case an excuse will be found to adjourn
the meetings over from day to day. The
Japanese will not be impatient, but the
final decision wll without doubt come
this week. One of the members of the
Japanese mission to-night expressed the
opinion that, whether a treaty were
signed or not, the conference would com
plete its labors by the end of the week.
"Once the bases are agreed to," said he,
"few details remain to be arranged."
snake peace, but to pay tribute to the
enemy.
It is significant in this connection that
Mr. de Witte took occasion to-day to
formally deny the published reports
from St. Petersburg to the effect that
after a meeting of the council for the
national defense, presided over by Grand
Duke Alexis, the Emperor telegraphed
to Mr. de Witte to come to an under
standing with the Japanese. Mr. de
Witte said:
"The report is a pure Invention. There
is not a word of truth in it. The national
council for the defense has held no meet
ing. The Grand Duke Alexis never
uttered a statement like that attributed
to him. On the contrary, the news from
General Llnevitch is entirely reassuring.
1 am not a military man and I cannot,
therefore, give advice or express opinions
on military affairs; but what I know is
that the whole Russian army, and es
pecially General Llnevitch, his officers
and the soldiers under their command,
are ciO6t insistent that peace should not
be concluded." 1

Continuing, the statement ,. says in
part: \u25a0
Summer lemons in Messina are reported
one-fourth larger than last year by Con
sul Canlngly. and the quality is much
better. The following report is made of
the almond crop:
"The almond crop promises to be of
good quality, and It is estimated that the
yield Tv-ill reach IPO.OOO bags of fifty kilos
each. Thi>-. it will be understood, repre
sents the probable product of the island.
To attempt to .give an estimate of the
yield of tbc district would be. useless, for
the reason that the exportation is not
confined absolutely to production of a
certain locality. Exporters buy from
every part of Sicily, and a bag of almonds
or filberts shipped from Messina contains
the products of every district in Sicily."
Consular Agent Carlcton of Alemira
Bays raisins do not enter Into the export
trade of the city and the muscatel crape
Is not raised. He says attention is given
solely to tfcs white grape.
Palermo lemons will be sold in large
quantities, according to the news from
Agent Paterurtif. The crop is said to be
one-third Ices than last year. The qual
ity and size of the fruit is said to be up
to the average.
Only one-half of last year's crop of
prunes is expected In Austria, as reported
by Consul General tThester of Budapest.
There will be 2WO carloads if the crop
suffers no further damage. The fruit was
smail. though plentiful, last year, and
the reverse is true of the present season.
Owing to the frosty weather in Castal
lamau the green crop of lemons is de
stroyed, according to Commercial Agent
Crowinshield. Ten thousand boxes is es
timated as the size of the crop, and the
rates are the sxime as last year. The cold
of the last winter has had a good effect
en the walnuts.
Reports from the American commercial
agents and Consuls in Europe on the
fruit conditions and markets have been
received by the California Horticultural
Commission. Messina, Budapest, Malaga,
Alicante. Alemira. Castallamau and Pa
lermo are the centers from which the
crop prospects and present market rat-
Ings are sent. On the whole, the condi
tions are unfavorable.
Consul Birch of Malaga writes that a
syndicate has been organized to control
the almond market of Malaga. It com
prises the seven principal exporters. This
company is called the Compania Almen
drera. Birch's report Is as follows:
"The Spanish aJmonds of commerce are
the 'Jordan* and 'Valencia' brands. The
ordinary crop' of the former is about 70,
000 boxes, while the yearly yield of 'Va
lencia' usually numbers more than double
that figure. Malaga is the exporting cen
ter, and as no competitors are in sight
it Is likely that the Compania Almen
drera will handle the entire business."
From Alicante comes the news that the
prices are not yet quoted on almonds for
the year. Consular Agent Carey says:
"The prospects and conditions of the
almond crop this year are, on the whole,
poor, owing to the drought experienced in
the district of Alicante. In sire the crop
can be considered good, but the lack of
rain has prevented the growth of the
fruit, especially in the non-irrigated dis
tricts, where the kernels are particularly
email."
The platform, which was fifty feet
square, had been constructed over the
foundation walls for the . accommodation
of the rabbits, officers of thÂ© church and
Invited guests. Just prior to the corner
stone ceremony, a brass band leading SCO
Zionists, arrived. When the Zionists were
invlfed to pass over the platform In order
to sign their* names to the roll to bÂ»
placed in the stone, a mad rush was made
by the thousands of person gathered to
secure the same privilege. The police
men were overwhelmed. In a moment
the platform was packed and the frail
structure collapsed. I
* The panic that followed attracted thou
sands of persons to the spot and the po
lice had great difficulty In extricating the
screaming and groaning victims from the
wreckage.
When the cellar had been cleared It
was -found that scores were hurt, their
injurie* consisting of bruises and cuts
about the head and body. Some of the
Injuries were due to the panic that fol
lowed the crash, many being trampled
on in the wild rush to escape.
Rabbi Ashinsky was trampled upon and
suffered severe injuries, but continued the
services after some order had been re
stored. The fact that there were no fa
talities Is a marvel, as when the plat
form broke it closed up lllie a knife,
throwing the people Into a struggling
mass In the cellar.
A- rumor gained credence that several
children were burled In the ruins and
frenzied fathers and mothers who could
not locate their children were restrained
with difficulty.
PITTSBURG. Aug. 20.â More . than 600
men. women and children were precipitat
ed fifteen feet Into a cellar by the col
lapse of a platform to.-day during the ex
ercise Incident to the laying of the corner
stone of the Beth David Russian Hebrew
Orthodox Synagogue on Miller street, near
Washington. Nearly all of them were cut
and bruised, but it Is believed no one
was \u25a0 fatally hurt. Three rabbis were
among " those who went down, and al
though injured they continued the cere
mony after the panic had subsided.
Among the more seriously Injured are:
Rabbis Ashinsky, S. Graffman, A/ Bloom.
Abraham Nathanson, pastor at the con
gregation, and Policeman Adam Lef
teweskl.
J. H. Garrison, editor of the Christian
Evangelist. St. Louis, Mo., and A. Mc-
Lean, president Foreign Christian Mis
sion Society, Cincinnati, Ohio, gave
thanks and asked the Lord's blessing
upon all those who were about- to par
take of the bread' and wine passed to
them by the 26 elders and 120 deacons ap
pointed for. that special service. The
j bread and wine were placed upon thirteen ,
tables in different parts of the building,
each table being in charge of two elders.
As soon as the blessings were over, the
ciders passed the bread and wine- to the
i deacons, who in turn passed them to the
j congregation, and in less than ten min
utes the thousands of people assembled
had received communion. Those - who
acted as elders are: E. "W. Darst, Thom

The choir singers, who were under the
leadership of Rev. E. T. Nesbitt of Fresno,

three opening hymns. â¢. ** _â¢
More, than 5000 people assembled in
Woodward's Pavilion yesterday after
noon to take part Jn the union commun
ion service of the International Mission
ary Convention and, although the serv
ices only lasted a little over- an houn,
they were the most impressive held upon'
this coast for a long time.
It is safe to say that this is the largest
communion service ever held in the West,
and the way the immense congregation
was handled showed careful preparation
and study on the part Of those who had
the matter in hand. . _ \u25a0 â¢ \u2666

corner-stone, after Judge "William H.
Waste, president* of the Board of Trus
tees, had delivered the invitation.-
The new church building is one of "great
architectural .beauty- It is designed < in
the modern English -Gothic style, ..with
stone base, porch and tower. ..., plaster
walls and slate roof.. The main audi
torium is. 34x46 feet, with Sunday-school
rooms, ladies' parlor, kitchen and pas
tor's study adjoining. | The seating ca
pacity cf the aud|torium "can be /nearly
doubled by opening tho > sliding doors
which shut off -the Sunday-school rooms.
The new Epworth .Church building is
situated at the corner of Telegraph aye :
nue. and Durant street.. Its .location .is
deemed to be choice. The land on which
the church stands was bought at a figure
much below that for which it could be
secured now. The location is_ but. a

Any possibility of question as to .title
is between the city and the State. In
view of thÂ« fact that the land is useless
for any purpose unless reclaimed, the
city authorities haive no doubt that the
municipality can assert its claims suc
cessfully. With private claimants out of
the way, they see nothing to hinder rapid
progress with the general scheme of park
and lake. lmprovement.
Questions concerning the title and the
lines of the property were. submitted sev
eral weeks ago to the City Engineer, arid
the City Attorney by the Park and Boule
vard Committee of the City Council,
"which has in hand the ordinance to ap
propriate $50,000 for the dredging of Lake
Merritt, the" dredginga to ,be used to re

The wanderer was dressed in a rough
\u25a0working suit of overalls and jumper. He
had only a few matches and some, \u25a0 to
bacco on hie person. He was about five
feet ten inches tall and wore a black
beard. His hair, very dark, was cut close.
Deputy Coroner F. Conrad, who took
charge of the rase, could find nothing
that would clear up the man's antece
dents. A day or two ago Harris was seen
wandering in the hills near Midway. He
â¢was bagging for food and said he had
raten nothing for several days. Harris
disappeared from Midway Friday, as
rearlv as Conrad could learn.
VTJIUam Baulpaugh, engineer, of an c^
tra freight train. running west from Mid
way, noticed the form of a man prostrate
in a clump of bushes near the track as
the train was pulling slowly over, the
grade near Altaniont. Saulpaugh thought
the man might have been Injured or
killed by accident, and he stopped to in
vestigate. He called Conductor Hanford,
and with others of the train crew they
went to the recumbent figure. The man
was not dead, but was In such a debili
tated condition that it was with difficulty
he cculd be carried to the caboose. The
trainmen cared for the dying sufferer un
til they arrived at Llvermore, where he
was turned over to the city .authorities.
Harris was out of his head and could not
talk coherently long enough to help the
Inquirers in their efforts to learn some
thing about his case. -
Dr. H. G. McGill and Dr. Collins were
called to attend the patient. They pro
nounced him as dying from starvation.
He was watched carefully through the
night
OAKLAND, Aug. CO.â lnsane from star

this morning, where he had been taken
last night by Southern Pacific Railroad
men, who found the dying man hidden' In
a pile of brush near the tracks at..Mid
way, fourteen miles east of Livermore.
Terribly emaciated, a mere \u25a0 shadow^ of
a man. delirious and unable to stand on
his feet, the suffering wanderer, who had
been roaming the hills like a wild man
for days, 6uccumbed before be "could give
any account of himself. During intervals
of comparative rationality the dying

name, age and nativity. Through the
night he lapsed into unconscious spells.
Early this morning the signs of ap
proaching death were manifest, and at
3:30 o'clock he died. â¢- ":â¢ /â¢ â¢..*â¢ ~. H

The -figures- which are; cited -to-prove-it:

on an entire .misconception of the -.; facts,

railway traveling |is ,actually . in"*-

which are supposed to afford such' over- j

STATISTICS UNRELIABLE.
British .railways, last, year . killed one
person for. every f eighteen, and . a ; quarter

killed '" for * eyeryJ VigrÂ»ts'*f our .' andTa half
miles of track. This shows that 1 the rail
ways iof the United \u25a0 States <.' are, V roughly
speaking, four and a half timed safer than
those on ; the'- British I'lsles. J If \u25a0 the com
parison be made on 'the; basis of the.num-.

an act for the prevention. of accidents on

a' very [ imperfect * measure. It made no
provision for automatic car-couplers such

British railway companies . cbtaln their
earnings . chiefly from their passenger
traffic. ,-,The accident. statistics relating
to ! them are distorted" in their interests.
By feme mysterious'mef hod they control
tht Â«ystem .under which they are tabu
lated. The Board of Trade statisticians
who compile the flgures are not respons
ible for. it. - They, view With- disgust the
botch that is made of their labors by the
higher officials. ; But tthey are powerless
to -prevent it.' One 'of. the .compilers, with
whom I discussed the burlesque official
report, told me that; he had visited the
United States â¢ a few, years ago and . in
spected the railways ' there to obtain
points for -Parliamentary railway â¢ legis
lation.
Frank Cwasc-t, a. eailor belonging to tbe
ship Red Rock, tried to make "roush-house"
on board that vessel yesterday morning. Ac
cording hie own report, he had been up
town spending the nlgfat. and landed on board
the ehlp prea.lly tyider the Influence of- Bar
bary Coast booze. He said he wanted to
fight the captain, and everybody on board the
ship. .Being a big, burly Belgian, his chances
ror knocking out the crowd were good. He
first sent what few of the crew were on board
scampering away to the forecastle. While
the tumult was going on. Captain Rice came
tmt to see what the disturbance was all about.
He had no sooner put In an appearance thau
Cwjiset made a break for him. Captain lUce
yelled "Policf:" and ducked into his cabin.
Officer Jerry Clifford was passing at the
time, and la company with A. J. Camous cf
the Harbor Emergency Hospital- stair, ran on
board thÂ« Red Rock, and after a furious Uie
cle with the drunken sailor succeeded In
handcuffing him. Cwaset flew into a rage
and refused to (fo ashore. He would not walk
up the pang plank, and aÂ» he \u25a0weighed some
thing ovÂ«r 200 pounds, v the combined efforts
of Clifford and Camous were . not sufficient to
carry him up. Finally a rope was tied around
bis waist, the end of trhlch was attached to
one of the yard stays. The crew took hold or
the other end of the rope and hoisted the
et^xirm'.ng. kicking sailor "cargo like" Into
the air. and ewung him cnto the dock. Here
l->*Â» vm put into the patrol *agon. which
took him up to the Harbor Police Station.
The sc*ne attracted a great crowd of spec
tators who enjoyed the unusual spectacle.

â¢ The American bark Homeward Bound,
â¢which arrived in port last Wednesday,
docked at Mission street wharf No. 1
yesterday afternoon. No trimmer or
cleaner ship ever lay In this harbor. In
; honor of his return to his home port
' Captain Chadwick D. Thompson gave an
informal -reception on board the vessel
yesterday. She presents a very different
appearance now from the time she first
Â«uade her entry into this port, some four
r and a half years ago. when she was
known as the German ship Otto Gilde
meister. When she arrived In San Fran
cisco then she was dismantled and in bad
shape. She was repaired here at that
lime, but her repairs cost bo much money
that ehe was condemned and sold by the
underwriters. Hind. Rolph & Co. bought
her. and by special act of Congress had
her changed Into American registry. On
her present trip from Newcastle-on-Tyne
to this port she made the run In 119 days,
notwithstanding the fact that she ran
into rough weather and heavy gales. On
April S3 her sails were all practically torn
away and she was running under bare
poles. On June 20, when nearing the
â¢ Horn, ehe ran Into heavy gales and
. strong winds and again lost more saiL
She was only twelve ways in rounding
the Horn. Her cargo of coke, pig Iron
and chalk will be discharged where she
aow lies.

ANSWERS 10 QUtRIES.
DISCI^SSION, and by it a clearer understanding of each others
view, is probably all that will result from; the National Con
ference for the Promotion of Uniformity of Legislation in
the United States which is- slated to begin on the iBth of this month.
Inasmuch as the Divorce Law Commissions from the various States
are to meet in Washington soon after the adjournment of the Nar
ragansett conference it is likely the* maurfeature of these two great
gatherings will be the seeking of some plan of uniformity in mar
riage and divorce laws. Certainly' that is the question which the
country 'will regard as the one of principal interest. In that matter
approximation to uniformity in some minor details may be agreed
upon as advocable by the conferrees, but the bigger difficulties w.iU
remain unsettled. The only way for these larger differences to be
changed to uniformity is. by constitutional amendment that would
make the legislation an affair of Congress. v
To' illustrate why this must be so, take for example an extreme
caseâ that of harmonizing New York and South Carolina. In a way
these two States stand closer together on the subject than any. of
the others. New York is the one State in which \t is most difficult
to obtain a divorce, and South Carolina is the State in which it. is
Impossible. -Here ihen you would, think there is a chanc<i for union
on a compromise. To seek it though would be to be confronted with
insuperable differences. New York permits the intermarriage of ncr
groes and whites, and -indeed any imaginable intermixture of races.
Chinese, Indiansâ anything. In South Carolina the desire to pre
serve race purity and the feeling of obligation to it would amount
to a passion of resistance to any legalizing of mongrelism. . More
than that; any attetnpttp make miscegenation a. respectable prac
tice would be to them an abomination. Such differences could not
be discussed away. They would be too deep seated to be re'iiioved
by argument. â¢â¢
That may be an extreme case, but there would be other varia
tions of feeling and opinion .tfiat could not be reconciled. Where
one community of people would regard as ideal, South Carolina's
rule of indissoluble marriage their vie\ys would meet opposition from
other States whose people would believe that South Carolina's strict
law causes a great deal more wrong than it prevents. The shameful
ill-treatment that wives in South, Carolina have to, put up .with^be
cause they lack the remedy of divorce illujtrajtes very well that
absolute strictness can never be accepted; as a model for the wHble
of the States. If any relaxation is allowed, then opinions and feelt
ings will vary as to thekind and extent of the' alreviation. One of
the best hopesrwe may have in the niatter-is^ini the* advancer in T the
science of statistics.- Until we have a great â¢ multitude : of plainly
stated facts to, generalize upon, it is clearly impossible to ;cbn
scieatiously declare whether we have too many divorces in America
or altogether too few. : - â . . .- - .
THE NARRAGANSETT CONFERENCE.
A .young man who had' been re
claimed-from the vice of intemperance
was called .upon to tell how he was led
to give up drinking. He .arose, but'
looked for a moment very confuted. All
he could say. was: "The -little shoes,
they did it." With a Hhlck voice, as if
his heart was In his throat,, he 'kept re
peating \u25a0 this. * There 1 was a ! sla r?, of

THE LITTLE SHOES DID IT.
LONG TIME FOR INCREASE.
PROFESSOR DAVID TODD
AS the long tracks of total eclipses
of the sun often extend for 5000
miles or more across the earth's
surface, and as that surface Is
much more largely; composed of water
than land. It Is evident that the majority
of eclipse paths must fall over some
ocean where It Is practically lost to
science. â¢
In 1555 Professor Plazzl f Smyth, late
Astronomer Royal of Scotland, made ex
periments on his voyage to the island of
Teneriffe with reference to devising In
struments placed on the deck of a ship
stable enough to make accurate .astro
nomical observations, and the result was
particularly encouraging. . Similar , at
tempts have been made by- both French
and American naval officers, and in the
tropical waters of the Dutch East Indies
In 1901 Professor Todd." of Amherst, tried
anpt her d evice, with effects which seemed
..to promise i'". possible isolutlon . of . the
; problem. ; 'â¢'â¢â¢'â¢ W : ;
Like other eclipse tracks, that of. the
corning one on August SO lies; chiefly over
the ocean- .Starting. In at Hudsons Bay
early In the morning,, this path runs
southeasterly across the peninsula' of
Labrador, Â£ thence ' over the Atlantic and
Spain and the Mediterranean to Northern'
Africa, where it traverses parts of Al
geria, Tripoli and Egypt, ; ending in
Arabia at sunset. . '
Always the best part of an eclipse path
for observation, is that occurring, at local
noon, and in this "case Hhat t will be' on v the
.Atlantic; Ocean, not Jfar" from ;the. south
"coast of Engia'rid ; and; directly; -in | the
.course of trans- Atlantic" liners, the pas
sengers of which; will thus -have an un
usually excellent opportunity of witness
ling a; beautiful* and impressive Bpec
, tacle. '\u25a0.'.''. ; : . \:.y'[
% However unstable the -deck may be for
accurate astronomical observations,- It
does not affect the splendor of the sight,
and Atlantic passengers" on ! August 30 In
this, region of the high; seas. may count
themselves as peculiarly fortunate,
/if such travelers have cameras of any
size their snapshots of the corona will be
of considerable value, and should any one
possess a facile "'pencil, drawings of the
extended rays and Interwoven filaments
of this lovely halo will be of use after
ward in showing the kind or type of this
corona^and whether or not, as is antici
pated, rlt may; resemble the coronas
ing the ; eclipses of ISS2 and ISS3, very fully
developed i all" around the sun.
\u25a0The corofta -bears some as yet unex
plained relation to the sun spot periods,
and in 1905 we \u25a0 have had several very
large and prominent spots, which appear
to have a sub-period of about thirty-five
or thirty-six days, and during these times
there ia much greater solar activity.
Contrary to the old -belief that sun
spots, being darker, were therefore cooler
than the general brilliant surface of the
sun, |t Is now apparently, established by
inference from the .latest observations
that the spots mean a giving off of very
heated matter. It is possible that the
unusually hot summer in the East may
be traceable to the large and very con
spicuous sun spots now In evidence.
'In consequence of this eclipse . track
falling near the courses of so many ves
sels there will, be a far. larger number
than : usual of â¢ persons i observing It by
pencil, camera or otherwise.' and The
Call has* the advantage of presenting to
its readers a map of the Atlantic and
Mediterranean , portions of ' the ' eclipse
path, about one hundred miles wide, from
which in any part of it the eclipse will be
seen as total. * - -
I MAP SHOWING ECLIPSE PATH AND^AMHERST PROFESSOR WHO WRITES OF TH2 COMING SOLAR EVENT.
The money market continues easy, with the supply of funds still
much in excess of the demand, and interest rates low. A recent
.Wall-street report says that this year's dividend record has been a
brilliant one, and the long list-of increases will shortly be augmented
by increased disbursements by large Eastern lines. Earnings for
the fiscal year just ended, which are now coming to hand, are an
eloquent explanation of the advance in the price of the leading rail
road shares. For the year ended June 30 the Great Northern
earned 18 per cent on its $125,000,000 capital, St. Paul earned 11. 2
per cent, Illinois Central 11 per cent, and the "Soo" road 13 per
cent.
These figures speak for themselves. When the great railroad
systems of the country earn such large dividends business must
necessarily be very good. No apprehension regarding the money
market. is felt, and there is little talk this year of governmental-as
sistance in furnishing money to move the crops. Even if the West
should have to draw on its large New York deposits to handle the
crops, the supply is so abundant that no strain is expected.
The conditions on the Pacific Coast continue bright. The crops,
while not over large,- are sufficient fpr the demand, and 1 in the case
of wheat and some important fruits there is a shortage which prom
ises large prices to the general farming and fruit-growing interests.
We are now having the liveliest and strongest markets for dried
fruits for many a year, and the stocks of canned fruits have been
drawn upon so heavily that the canners have advanced quotations
for some kinds and withdrawn those for others. The wool clip
is coming in upon a bare market. Hops, which declined during the
past month or so, are now advancing. Hides and leather are ex
tremely active and firm. There is such a steady demand for barley
and oats that all efforts to depress prices are unavailing. Provisions
have made several notable advances during the past thirty days.
Real estate is very firm, with the demand for both city and country
properties very active, while building operations, especially in San
Francisco, are very large, with no signs of diminution. The lumber
industry is of course .affected by these building operations, and is
reported flourishing. The city and interior banks are plentifully sup
plied with funds, and altogether the commercial situation is about
all that can be desired. '""
The chief factor in producing this general improvement in busi
ness was the fine crop prospects. The' harvest of the country is now
well under way, and the status of the crops is pretty definitely
settled. It is agreed that the combined cereal production will prob
ably exceed air other years, botK in quantity and quality. Cotton
will not exceed i 0,000,000 bales, on the basis of the last estimate of
a condition of 74, but wheat, corn, oats and hay promise bumper
yields. The railroads, in consequence of this brilliant crop outlook,
are expecting a rushing business, and the storekeepers all over 'the
land are rubbing their hands cheerfully in anticipation of another
excellent year. The footwear and textile manufacturers of Boston
and Philadelphia report the mills well employed, with orders booked
away ahead, and Pittsburg and pther iron -and steel centers report
the outlook for the metal business improving. A late statement from
this industry says: "Rail orders for 200,000 tons of heavy rails are
pending, and will probably be closed this month. For the full fiscal
year, the Steel Company's earnings are conservatively estimated at
$125,000,000 net, or equal to 10 per cent on the common stock. The
steel business to-day is more stable than in 1902 at the height of the
boom. The demand is large and increasing/and manufacturers are
determined to keep prices within reason and prevent an inflated
market"
LAST week was one of the very best trade weeks of the year.
Ftom all sections of the country commercial reports were
bright and spoke of an increasing demand for all sorts of mer
chandise. The leading Western cities received-large excursions of buy
ers from the country, and the Atlantic seaboard cities also reported an
unusual influx of general merchandise purchasers' from their re
spective districts. Collections, too, were said to be easier arid more
prompt, and all sections alluded to a marked expansion in. fall busi
ness. The clearing-houses exchanges reflected this stimulated more
ment in general gains, amounting for the whole country ; to 28.2
per cent over the corresponding week in 1905, and some of them
were large, notably 36.2 at New York, 37.4 at Philadelphia, 30.2 at
San Francisco, 23 at New Orleans (in spite of the yellow fever),
28.5 at Boston, 23.8 at Pittsburg, and so on. The failures: for the
week were 218, against 226' for the same week last year. All classes
of business, wholesale, jobbing and retail, united in these cheerful
reports.

WEDDINGS.
Miss Lillian Albertson, a young woman
who maSe a very successful debut at the
Grand Opera-house some three years ago,
shows large progress in her Arrah. De
lightfully pretty, thoughtful and graceful
is her Arrah. Miss Albertson has not yet
achieved simplicity, though coming very
near It at times. She still remembers her
self, is a little conscious of smile, glance
end gesture. Her costume even, a little
comic operatic, has a certain ccjnsclous
suggestion. But to have done what Miss
Albertson has done in so short a time is
to have done all, and more, than could
have been expected. Alice Lonnon waa
the Fanny Power, and though It Is not
Miss Lonnon's kind of role, she graced it.
Maggie Francis- Lea vey was the old Irish
woman, Katty, and one doesn't need a
better.
One of the beet performances In the
evening again was the capital O'Grady of
P. 6. Barrett. It was to the life the spir
ited, generous, simple-minded hotspur
of a colonel that Boucicault 'pictured.
Charles Wyngate was a good Beamish
McCoul. and Fred Wilson the Secretary
of State for Ireland with all the dignity
and distinction required.
There should be plenty of enjoj-ment In
"Axrah na Pogue" this week when they
ret the epeed up.
BLANCHE PARTTNGTON.
Human and magnetic as ever, and quite
the best of the current Irish comedians.
ono still finds Mr. . O'Sullivan. There is
Mg heart and big grip in the work, and
a fine, sincere art, too. His comedy is
Irish in the best sense of the wordâ sun^
ny, liappy- go-lucky, genial. And when it
comes to the "W<arin" of the Green"
one quite appreciates the lyric danger to
"England's cruel red," when the song
ie sung with the passion of patriotism
that Mr. O'Sullivan gets into it. He was,
as usual, generous with songs, including
"The Low Backed Car," "Kitty of the
Cows." "The Leprechaun," "Believe Me
If All Those Endearing Young Charms."
"The Emigrant," "Eavourneen Dheellsh"
ameng his list. He was at his best In tbe
"Wearln' of the Green."
Not at his best, though Mr. O'Sullivan
achieved almost his usual magnificently
genial touch in the trial scene, was the
comedian last night. He Bang, too, with
visible effort. Buffering probably from a
touch of our San Francisco climate. That,
too. will doubtless be soon remedied, and
as half at least of an Irish play .with
Dt-ris O'Sullivan in It Is Denis O'Sul
llvan's siaging, one hopes It will be very
soon.
Denis O'Sullivan came back to a loj-al
constituency last night at the Grand
Opera-house as Shaun the Post In "Arrah
na Pogue." A royal welcome went over
the footlights from a crowd that filled al
most every seat in the house. There was
afterward plenty of enthusiasm, yetâ? -
It was partly the performance. "Arrah
na Pogue." with its asides and kaleido
scopic scenes, needs swift playing to
make it plausible. That It did not have
last night. There were no gaps, but the
beat was slow. Even Mr. O'Sullivan him
seJf failed of his usual superb swing. One
began to discover the enchanting "Ar
rah" old-fashioned, to hanker after a
ShaW6 Hibernian wickedness in ."John
Bull and His Other Wand"; to wonder
if Boucicault really ever convinced.
One must not have time to wonder.
Time is fatal to the Boucicault drama.
Its fun and fenianlsm, love and law.
must be dealt out as Polacco deals out
a "Travista." and thenâ it may convince.
But the company was new, the perform
ance the first of the season, and In this
light every excuse can be made for the
leisurely tempos. Further, the company
is an exceptionally good one. and will
doubtless be speedily able to give worthy
account of itself.
It was unfortunate that Violet Dale
suffered from a severe cold, which for
bade her using her voice In her clever
Imitations. At that she gave a graphic
picture of Mrs. Leslie Carter In "Dv
Barry."
The old features were good. Jacob's
dogs were the curtain-raiser. Josephine
Alnsley was a graceful though not es
pecially -sweet- voiced comedienne. The
Yankee Doodle Boys have -7 Improved
o\~er last week and the Howard Broth
ers are as clever b&njoieta as ever.

There was fun at the Orpheum last
night, roaring. riotous Tvn â whole
bunches of It. It all came through
O'Brien and Havel â Mr. O'Brien and
MJsb Havel. If you please, office boy
and â¢typsle"â who presented a little
sketch called "Ticks and Clicks:"
The name doesn't have much of a
part. There are no "ticks" and fewer
"clicks"; the tnn comes through the
rollicking mirth of this pair of come
dians. You "don't know. that they are
acting â you- really don't; but for fif
teen minutes you watch them play
while the "boBS M j recovers from a head
ajcae of the night before, and you really
fed guilty of having fooled, the head
of the office yourself.
First, Mr. .O'Brien dusts the room.
There is. nothing fanny in the dusting
of the room, you would think, but be
fore O'Brien makes two swipes with
the feather, duster. you are convulsed
with laughter and your neighbor is
pounding you on \u25a0 the . back in his
screaming glee. Then comes Miss Ha
vel, "typsie." 6he -essays to talk over
the telephone to her lover. The tele
phone is a dummy and Mr. O'Brien an
swers. "Hejlo, dear, is that you?"
"Yesr who Ib thatr* "This Is 'tootsle,"
who did you think it was?" "I didn't
know. Z thought it might be the mag
who clings the haeh down at Annie's."
He Is caught, and in trying to escape
tbe wrath of "typsle" he dances a clog
on bis ear. Tbe two play and dance
and **roughhouse"; you hold your sides
In a fearful endeavor. to keep from
bursting; the curtain falls; Miss Havel
is accepting whole flower gardens; you
try to become sober before the next
act is finished.
The rest of the Orpheum bill is ex
cellent, too. Emll i Hoch, Jane Elton
and company appear In a Frenchy play,
a trifle risque, but not> vulgar. The
Millman Trio perform wonderful feats
on the tight wire, one of the young
laAies dancing a. ekirt dance in a
dnzztinsr fashion. â¢ . .

- BRAWLEY, Aug. 20.â Almost naked,

Harry Howard, who had been missing

to \u25a0â¢ lash his body to :a â¢ horse j and return
to town with it. The. s^ot wuere he was
found was less than two ' mile 3 from a
camp, at which there is an'; abundance
of water, but the ; rolling nature . of the
country prevented Howard from finding

?\u25a0 That Howard had tried in vain to sum
mon | aid when he found himself unable
togo' farther was indicated by the pres

had thrown away his clothing, garment

had sought, the shade .of the small bush

In the I morning tired, languid,
and frequently with a headache
. that is almost unbearable. You
: have been nervous, restless and
sleepless night after night, and
gloomy . and , irritable during
the day. â¢: iThis nervous exhaus-
tion affects the heart, limes and
other organs that depend upon
.the :. nerves for motive power.
Â»Then the stomach fails ; to di-
. gest ..the.food ; the heart action
is weak, and circulation poor,
and the kidneys and liver in-
active.
.What you need is not a stom-
ach, head, kidney or liver med-
icine, but Dr. Miles*, Nervine to
soothe and feed the nerves and
build nerve tissue.
"My wife mi subject to severe men-
tal strain, -which resulted In nervous
prostration. The first symptoms were
uncontrollable crying and melancholy
spells,* which Increased to Buch an ex-
.. tent that . for . over a : year she .would
; have a spell every day of trom- four
to six houra duration. She reotured
the constant attention of her physle-
' lan and attendants. She sufferec great
pain and ansulsh. The best physicians
attending her could give no relief. â¢ and
she finally became almost of unsound
mind. As a last resort I began giving
\u25a0 her Dr. Miles' Nervine, and Tonic, and'
noticed that her spells n.extday were^
not so severe, and they gradually dis-
appeared altogether. 6he has had no
recurrence of the spells, and Is gain-
ing In health find strength. s

If You Are Going to See a Clairvoyant. Why
Not See the Best?
As the best is always the cheapest in the end.
Better consult no clairvoyant at all than one-
who Is unable to help you. as false prophets do
more harm than good, as they leave you In a
worse condition than before by their false ad-
vice, based upon guesses; but PROF. NIBLO
has an established reputation; testimonials and
credentials from thousands of your own citi-
zens and friends. - " ' â¢
MR. NIBLO has made a life study of his
work and is prepared to advise and assist you.
no matter what your troubles are; In his ca-
pacity there is.no guesswork: every procedure
is definite and exact and the result Is certain.
If you have already made a mistake, thrown
away your money and lost confidence through
dealing with much-advertised and self-styled
palmists and clairvoyants and their cheap clap-
trap methods, start from the. beginning and
consult MR. NIBLO. He will tell you frankly
your condition and what you may expect: if
nothing can be done for you L* will not take
one cent of your money. Has not this honesty
During the last ten months I have brought
around through this wonderful power of per-
sonal control 721 marriages; - 142 separations,
without any after trouble, came by the mutual
consent of opposing parties; located 16 buried

nave already met ., with a party who promises
to supply all. the money necessary to develop
my claims. Before I came to you I had spent

PORTLAND, Aug. 20.â Cates finally -put
a stop to the victorious march of Uncle
Hank's cohorts to-day, the game going
to the Giants by a 2 to 1 score. It was
a corking good game the big crowd , at
the Vaughan-street - grounds '.witnessed.
Waldron. the flret man up, ".made a
single. Wheeler bunted and Cates failed
to catch Waldron at second. Hlldebfand
did . not help any, but Irwin's j long [ drive
to left field scored the Seals' lone run.
Then the pitchers settled down to bril
liant work. Whalen's arm : was in great
working order, Householder and Cates
being the only ones able to solve, his
twisters.' ...
In the fourth Householder hit hard . to
\u25a0\Valdron, who fell In a ditch In therout
fleld and the : ; runner reached third.
Mitchell flew to Irwlri. Schlafley fluked
to Waldron, he passed the ball to . Shea,
but Householder had wlnga on hls^feet
and Davis called him safe.
- In the seventh Cater- won his game
with a drive past shortstop, and McLean
romped home from the second station.
The score:

- ; LARKEPUR. Aug. 20.â Battling Nel
son passed his second day here doing
light training: on the road and at his
training- quarters ,at â¢â¢Smiling:" Metz
ner's. - Nelson, accompanied by Man
ager Nola'n and hie bull terrier,
"Mike," covered five miles on the
county road to-day at an easy jog:.
Charles Nelson, his kid brother, was out
\u25a0with him yesterday, but declined to
accompany him to-day, saying six days
on road work was enough for him and
that he would attend church. This
afternoon Nelson skipped the rope,
tossed the medicine ball and punched
the bag In the gymnasium. His bull
lerrler "Mike" enjoys punching the
sphere with- his head, â¢ the bag . being
lowered so that he, can reach it easily.
There was an immense crowd of visit
ors, the gym and approaches being
densely crowded.
It is Manager Nolan's intention to
have the major part of Battling's train-
Ing done in the open air and he has
added horseback riding, rowing and
boxing on a . platform erected in the
.rear of Metzner's place to the daily
training duties of Nelson so that he
wjll be \u25a0_ accustomed to outdoor, work.
Nelson's road work covers a couple of
hours on foot and an hour will be de
voted to riding one of the two saddle
.horses which arrived here last night.
Nolan feels the horseback riding will
be a pleasant and an invigorating
change from the strict line of training
generally followed. Rowing will be an
other diversion and he will spend half
an hour with a pair of oars on the
Corte Madera Creek. Rowing is an ex
cellent exercise for, the muscles of the
arms and shoulders. Owing to Nelson's
lower lip being split from alkali, which
abounds in the Sierra Nevada district,
Nolan does not expect to have him do
any sparring before Tuesday. Jimmy
Gardner, who is training here for his
fight with Ryan, and Jde Angell will
spar, in the outdoor arena until the ar
rival of Fred Landers, Nelson's regular
fparring partner.
Nolan expects that a decision In the
Ilrltt-Nelson match will be given be
tween the twelfth and twenty-fifth
round, the thirtieth at the, utmost.
Nelson Expects -to -Win Inside of
Twenty-Fire Rounds.

''WÂ« had to do it," explained Bonaparte
Britt. "Jimmle started to work to-day,
but . the mob .came in and carried away
the gymnasium for a souvenir. Jimmle
<Jldn"t like to do It, but we've simply got
to take the money. It's tedious work, of
course, shoveling in the shekels, but we
are forced to cop the filthy lucre for our
own protection."
When the tnultltude forced him out of
the g-yrrmasiurn James " Edward mounted
a horse and galloped down the boulevard
v.ith Willie Pratt. He spent several hours
cantering along by the sad sea waves and
locking over the sand dunes for good sites
for new flats.
The little champion looks better than
evtr. He came in from his ride full of
ginger arid looking pleased with' the real
estate propects and the beach way. It Is
Tumcred that Jimmle is negotiating for
the purchase of several blocks of ocean
front lotfc and that he will line this side
of the Pacific with modern flats when. the
cruel war Is over. He will have Xat
Goodwin for a neighbor.
Jirr.rr.ie went to the Orpheum in the
rt-entng. He will begin active work to
fi'ay when the schedule of prices will keep
admirer* at a respectful distance. From
his appearance he does not , need much
work, as he is in the salmon pink of con
dition,
"I'm going to go horseback riding every
day," he- announce^ "This is great."
' Entrance tickets to the Britt continuous
vaudeville training show can be had at

â¢ Oakland closed its baseball engagement
I with . Tacoma yesterday : by, treating v the
' Tigers to a double defeat..; in the after
! noon session tho multitude was treated to
j a high -class exhibition, of: and lot, ball on
the part , of the , champs. -While- Oakland
played the game as it- should be played.
All kinds of plays v/tre shown' during the
nine , rounds; . Hair-raising \u25a0 catches and
lightning. pick-ups were performed by" the
tall-enders. Cn the otner hand. Mike's
men;did their utmost to rriaka lt ; appear
an open-air burlesque. .Young ; Emerson
was given the honor of. occupying j the hill
buforo] a select Sunday/a ttendance, but
he dldjnot impress the one-day-a-week
gathering as he did trie regulars
the .past week." He showed a select Jas
sortmtnt of benders,'- but 1 appeared .ama
teurish in fielding his position, i Schmlddy
did 'the box work for the suburbanites
and twirled creditably. Score: Oakland
1, Tacoma 0; Oakland 4,' .Tacoma 1. -
The Smiling One, appeared a little off in
the opening period, as : he generously
passed Doyle. ( Shte.ian helped matters
with a single. "Dyke" then sent them
bqth along- on a sacrifice. ..McLaughlln,
who had been doing some terrific batting
during the last two weeks, found ; a va
cant space, 'scoring the "lean ; one.". â¢: The
Tigers shut up like a .jack knife there
after, allowing the score. bdy to carn-hlÂ«
salary without working. ;
The spectators were inclined to ; think
Van had put up a job cm Mike's men and
dipped the ball in a, grease pot. from, the
manner in which the Tigers let tlie sphere
slip through their, mits In Oakland's half
of; the ! , intial* framed With' a, combina
tion of slips, bopts and wild pitches and,*
Incidentally, a balk by Emerscn^ the
Commuters: were : allowed, to' send three
over the rubber on a single '\u25a0< hit.- This
gave the Oakland - : men ~. confidence . and
they had the Tigers buffaloed the re
mainder of the contest."

: Two tennis tournaments were played
j yesterday by the racket " wlelders. On
the California Club courts an interesting
class singles event was run off, while on
the public courts at Golden Gate Park
a similar event commenced, last " Sunday
was completed. The winners at the Cali
fornia Club were George Janes, first
class; Albert Kenyon, second class;
Charles Kuehn, third class, and G.
Browne, fourth class.
The first class was productive of some
exceedingly close matches which proved
the classification to be a good one. Janes
and Herbert Schmidt came together in
the finals. \u25a0 The former won in straight
sets. Schmidt made a good stand in the
first set," which went to 10-8. In the 1 sec
ond set Janes played better tennis, while
his opponent seemed to weaken. This
set Janes took easily by a^core of 6-2.
Probably the closest and most Inter
esting match in the class was that be
tween Harry Rolfe and George Musch,
who won the Northwestern championship
recently at Portland. These two cracks
met at San Rafael in July and Rolfe won
easily. His opponent has improved won
derfully since then, as the score of yes
terday's contest proves. . Of the first. two
sets each player took one comfortably,
but the third was a nip and tuck affair.
Rolfe was declared a . winner after
eighteen eames ! had been played.
In the semi-finals Schmidt beat Rolfe
after losing the first set. This match was
also close. In the other semi-final
match Janes beat Roy Cornell in straight
sets, the last of which went to deuce. .
In the second class Al Kenyon. after
having a desperate struggle with Dr.
Lovegrove In the opening round, won hl3
next two matches *asily. In the finals
he beat A. E. Beyf uss about as he
pleased.
All three matches In the third class
went the limit, the final match being the
longest of the day.' The contestants were
Ed Bacon, winner of the cvp 1 in the -last
tournament, and Charles Kuehn. The
match went the fun .five Bets, none of
which was at all close. Kuehn wound It
up with a 6-0 set.
G. Browne, a ' newcomer at the club,
carried off the fourth class honors. Dr.
Noble worked his' way, to the finals but
withdrew before the completion of the
second set. Browne won the first set 7-5.
and led at 5-2 in the second set.

This is the first visit Colonel Greene
has paid to San Francisco for many
years. He expects to remain here for
about a week and . will then return \u25a0 to
New. York to continue a refutation of
the recent- stories circulated regarding his
mining properties, | and . which he claims
are jnothing but the spiteful work, of his
enemies, of whom the colonel' frankly ad
mits \u25a0he has a number. Of the t recent
attack made upon him by Thomas Law
son of "Frenzied Finance" fame, and his
meeting later with Lawson in Boston,
â¢where â¢It was \u25a0 expected the two men
would engage in a duel. Greene bad little
to .say yesterday further than to remark
that Lawson Is all right in a way, but
that some of, his broad charges of cbr
,ruption among the leading financiers of
the country have to be accepted with
some -degree of doubt.
It Is said by Colonel Greene's friends
that the fight being made by his enemies
In New Tork against him is for the pur
pose of depressing the stock of his Mexi
can properties and freezing him out of
the corporations. \u25a0â¢/:,Â» - -
Colonel W. C. . Greene, the . noted New
Tork mining promoter and president of
several bis enterprises In Mexico and
the south western part of this country,
among them - the Greene Consolidated
Copper Company, which has . recently
been the object of a. number of bitter
attacks . from various sources, arrived
here yesterday from the East and Is
staying at the Palace Hotel. Colonel
Greene was In Southern California sev
eral weeks ago, but went East on a. hur
ried business call, while his wife came
to: this city to await his return. Arriv
ing" here yesterday- simultaneously with
the colonel, but from another direction,
\u25a0was A. C. . Bernard, manager of the
GreÂ«ne Copper Company. He has come
here to confer with Colonel Greene re
garding their business affairs.
