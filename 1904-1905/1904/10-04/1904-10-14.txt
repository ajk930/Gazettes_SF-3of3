close on the whisky fatalities of New
York and the subsequent revelations
there. Dr. C. W. Wiley, chief of the
Government Bureau of Chemistry,
sounded a note of -warning to-day.. In
an interview he expressed the opinion
that fully 85 per cent of all the whisky
sold In this country in hotels, restau

than cheap imitation. While this may
not ! be fatally poisonous, very much of
it is dangerous to the human system

all a fraud on the public. . .
The Government, through the< Bu

Wiley suggests better laws, regulating
the sale of strong drink, the most Im
portant of which- shall be a statute

to be labeled as such. "The passage of

Russian center, describe the bloody and
desperate character of the fight along
the railroad north of Yental station,
where on Monday the Russians repeat

the point of the bayonet, the fight con
tinuing into the night. The Japanese
reserved their fire until the Russians,
at the double, were almost upon them.
An instance is given of a regiment get
ting within a few yards of the Japanese
trenches, but recoiling before the mur
derous volleys of the Japanese, then
coming on again with reinforcements
literally under a shower of shrapnel
and finally succeeding < In driving out
the Japanese. But the Japanese artil
lery fire was so withering that the Rus
sians were unable to remain in the
trenches.
That' night ' the Japanese artillery
bombarded. the Russian center, prepar
ing the way for a general counter-at
tack, which Field Marshal Oyama or
dered for Tuesday. The Japanese of
fensive extended to their extreme left.

The action of the Grand Jury is
based on testimony heard concerning
the election officers In .the Eightieth or
Almshoase Precinct, where Joseph
Rebstock was inspector. It appears
that all of the six officers were Repub
licans, whereas the law requires that
precinct boards shall be divided po
litically: not one of them is a tax
payer, notwithstanding the statute de
clares that election officers shall be on
the assessment roll; only, five of the

who is the presiding Judge, by Fore
ir.an Alfred Lilienfold. The Judge re
fused to be Interviewed last ; evening
as to the matter, and would not give
ar.y opinion concerning the legal force
of the Grand Jury's resolution.
It is not contemplated to have the
Commissioners accused of any crime,
but charged with dereliction of duty
for not enforcing the requirements of
law regarding the qualifications of elec
tion officers. The only punishment, if
found guilty by. the jury, would be
ouster from office.
Willie the members of the jury that
anÂ» b?nt on making free use of the pre
rogative of indictment for violation of
the purity of elections law are not very
hopeful that anything further can be
accomplished, tbey were not in a mood
last night to give up what they declare
to be a solemn duty. Some thought the
force of public opinion may yet induce
the recalcitrant Jurors to see the error
of their way. At best, they admitted,
however, that the situation was dis
couraging and the. probability of more
Indictments for frauds very small. The
advisability of terminating the sitting
of the jury and the impaneling of a new
one was discussed favorably.
REQUEST FOR PROSECUTION*.
Four jurors refused to go into court
to return the indictment against Joseph
Rebstock, charged with misconduct
Â¦while serving as inspector in the Alms
house precinct, and Judge Sloss com
plied with a request of Foreman Lilien
feld to send the bailiff to bring them in.
there being only eleven Jurors on hand
and twelve being required by law. This
â¢uas the first outbreak of hostilities.
After adjournment, those who op
posed action against the Election Com
missioners came out of the heat of the
jury-room with emphatic declarations
th.u at the next meeting they would
take action to petition for the dismissal
of tho Grand 'Jury, for they were dis
gusted with its proceedings and did not
believe that any more good work could
b*Â» accomplished by it. They allege
animus and political machination
against those whom they regard as
overxealous in the probing of ballot-box
frauds.
Only eleven -members of the Grand
Jury would vote yesterday for a formal
accusation against the Election Com
missioners, â¢ and instead of a present
ment or an Indictment a resolution was
passed by the majority asking the pre
siding: Jud^e of the Superior Court to
direct the District Â¦'â Attorney^, to take
steps to oust the board, from office. Â»O
This unusual proceeding was. taken
as the last course possible â "the best
that could be done under the circum
stances," it â¢ was explained â after a
stormy session in which the discord
that has be*n brewing at several meet
ings had broken out into an open rup
ture. There is no legal provision for
such a resolution, and no authority to
compel the Judge to obey the Grand
Jury's request.
This left only eleven jurors to present
the indictment, and argument with the
unwilling: trio waxed furious. The law
was read and expounded to show that
it was not necessary that the twelve
Jurors who found the indictment should
be the same twelve to go Into court.
So long as there were a dozen on hand
on either occasion the i statutes would
be complied ' with.
But Welch and O'Brien insisted that
they would, not take part In accusing
a citizen of a crime unless they heard
the evidence " and : for a while had; the
better of the situation. They turned
a deaf ear to persuasion and argument
and stuck to their Idea of things. Dr.
Drucker was no more yielding than
they.
' Foreman Liilienfeld came "out into the
anteroom and telephoned for F. ' H.
Wheelan, W. H. Hazell and Dan Fitz
gerald, on whose testimony the charge
against Rebstock was based. They
added to their strength E. C. Harrison,
who was ready to tell of. some; exciting
experiences he' had, when . trying: to
challenge ; voters in the Eightieth Pre
cinct, where, the inmates off the; Alms-
The Grand Jury began its exciting
session at 2:30 o'clock and at once took
vp the matter of returning the indict
ment which the District Attorney had
prepared. The combat soon j> opened.
Charles W. Welch, secretary of the
body, announced that he was not pres
ent when the vote ,on the indictment
was taken Tuesday night, and not be
ing cognizant of the facts in the
case did not wish to have anything to
do with it. Matthew I. O'Brien was
also absent when the true bill was
found and he also demurred to appear
ing in court as supporting the accusa
tion. Dr. George I. Drucker had voted
against the Indictment and did not feel
that he should appear in court as hav
ing assisted in instituting the prosecu
tion against Rebstock.
"My conscience is easy,** said Com
missioner A. W. Voorsanger In discuss
ing the probable prosecution." "I know
that I have participated in no offense
against the law."
"The law requiring property qualifi
cation of an election "officer Is uncon
stitutional," said Commissioner E. C.
Leffingwell. "The requirement that the
officers must be residents of the pre
cincts in which they serve is imprac
tical, for when we learn at the eleventh
hour that a man cannot be on hand at
the polls we have to take an appointee
from the available list and send him
out to fill the vacancy. It is utterly
impossible to carry on an election prop
erly In every precinct if we are re
stricted to the precinct for its board of
officers. The. Grand Jury's attempt to
prosecute us is ridiculous."
"I regard the effort of the grand ju
rors as an outrage," was the comment
of Commissioner J. A. Devoto. "True,
we have not obeyed the letter of the
law. That was impossible and uncalled
for. We have committed no crime, and
here we are dragged before the public
as law-breakers. I was born^ and
raised in San Francisco and I value my
good reputation. I have never been
guilty of anything to darken it and the
stigma that is cast by the Grand Jury
without good reason is far from right.
I have no fear of consequences in court,
but to be placed in a false light, as has
now been done, is certainly unpleasant.
The chief aim of the grand jurors, in
my opinion, is to do politics, by be
smirching the present municipal ad
ministration." ..:,:â, - .:
Grand Jury were determined to hold
the Board of Election Commissioners
accountable. Evidence had been gath
ered that a number of changes were
made arbitrarily in the personnel of
various precinct boards the night be
fore the primaries.

Last month both Cuff and Tilley. de
cided to come East and look up the
girl. They met on the train and the
story came out. \ Each was coming to
be married. They found that both
carried the same photograph. They
went back to the farm and wired to
Washington. .
The postofflce authorities say Mc-
Kinney has fully two score victims in
different localities.
About a year ago McKinney was in
California, and there met many well
to-do farmers, including .Tilley and
Cuff. He was there for some time.
Soon after he returned to the East
both Tilley and Cuff began receiving
letters written in a feminine hand and
saying the writer had been referred to
the one addressed by Rev. Mr. McKin
ny. Cuff's letter was signed by "Anj
nie." Tilley's by "Mary." Soon a re
quest was sent East for a photo
graph â one by each man, unknown to
the other. Each received the portrait
of a beautiful woman. The next mail
eastward . carried a proposal of mar
riage from each of the farmers. |
Both were accepted, but the letter
received by each said the girl could
not come without money. Each Cali7
fornian sent $50 and the romance
ended there.
PITTSBURG, Pa:,- Oct. 13. â Rev.
Homer L. McKinney, for years one of
the be^ known evangelists in the Erie
conference, but for some time past
proprietor of a portrait establishment
in*Freeport, Pa., was this evening
committed to jail by United States
Commissioner Lindsey, to await a
court hearing.
McKinney is charged with having
obtained money by fraud, using the
mails for that purpose. According to
the postal authorities, he has been
passing himself off aa two marriage
able maidens and making violent love
to California farmers, becoming en
gaged to two of the latter arid collect
ing money for a wedding trousseau
from each. Postofflce arid Federal of
ficers: of Philadelphia. -who-jOTari^-iha
arrest this afternoon, say that the evi
dence reveals a remarkable scheme.
"Annie Hall" and "Mary Roberts"
are the names under which the parson
is alleged to have made love and con
ducted his campaign. William Tilley
and J. X. Cuff, wealthy ranchmen of
Eureka, Cal., are the two victims who
appear on the surface.
When arraigned this evening the
parson had little or nothing to say.

of the right army occupied the north

The right army succeeded in occupying
Maerh Mountain. The central army,
beginning operations from midnight,
October 11, reached the heights ex

TOKIO. Oct. 13â It is yet too early
to measure the results of the tremen
dous struggle which has been waged
for the past three days south of Muk
den, but all reports reaching Tokio in
dicate that General Kuropatkin has
been decisively AvhipiÂ«ed and severely
punished. The Russian commander
was evidently caught while making his
dispositions with his forces scattered,
and he was beaten before he. could re
cover.
Much depends on the ability and the
resolution of the Japanese in applying
&nd following up their advantages
Kuropatkin may turn upon favorable
ground and succeed In beating back
the Japanese onslaught, but the tide
seems against him.
The Japanese yesterday began a des
perate effort to turn the Russian right,
and if this effort should be successful
it will carry disaster to the Russian
arms.
The struggle around Benshiu is be
ing followed with intense interest here.
The Russian force there is estimated
at bOOO, and its isolation or loss would
be a severe blow.
Estimates of the total forces engaged
vary. One telegram from Liaoyang
says that the Russians have 200,000
men, with 1000 guns. The Japanese
force exceeds the number engaged at
the battle of Liaoyang.
RUSSIAN GUNS CAPTURED.
The latest telegrams from the front
indicate the continuation of Japanese
euccess. General Oku's left army alone
bagged twenty-five guns.
The Russians made two desperate

left, but were repulsed with heavy
slaughter. The Japanese commanders

ST. PETERSBURG, Oct. 13.â A dis

"The fight opened to-day before
sunrise, when the sound of guns was
heard from the southward. I am leav
ing now for the front. The Russian
troops on Tuesday occupied; Yentai
Station, but the Japanese continued to
hold the Yentai mines, though a furi

thus found themselves In an Important
position on the Japanese flank.
"There are maijy contradictory re

WEDNESDAY'S FIGHTING.
An extended report received from the
headquarters of the ManchuriaÂ» ar
mies, a brief summary of which was
published this afternoon, indicated that
the Japanese were generally success
ful In the fighting of yesterday and
that all three of the Japanese armies
gained decided -advantages.
The operations designed to isolate
and surround the Russians at Benshiu
were progressing favorably.
The numbers engaged in the strug
gle exceed the forces which fought at
Liaoyang. In some ' places the fight
ing surpasses in desperation anything
shown since the war began. The losses
are not indicated, but they unquestion
ably are heavy. v
A telegram covering yesterday's op
erations, which arrived here to-day,
says:
"In the direction of Benshiu the ene
my's attacks have been repulsed at
all points. Communication with Chi
aotao has been firmly established. The
pursuit of the enemy undertaken by
the main force of the right and center
armies has progressed remarkably. ,

"On October 11 the Japanese attack

A fierce fight raged all day long and
by night the greater portion of the

"throughout October 11 the Russians

where they /were obliged to retire to

"Port Arthur is different. Should it
be captured those in 'Russia who are
supposed to favor a reasonable settle
ment would have a sentimental, ma
' terial factor in . favor of their point of
a view that no development of the Man
churian campaign could provide. Japan,
In possession of Port Arthur, could
treat for, peace. How much longer Port
Arthur can last I have not the least
idea. Hot weather Is an advantage to
the defenders. From the Intense heat
and sanitary disadvantages the Japan
ese' could not 'get away. Against the
cold nosL. com Ing on they can take the
necessary precautions and suffer none
of those epidemics, whereto, if they are
not victim, they are at least exposed.
- "It' is impossible," ' concluded Baron
Hayashl, "to think that this* war can
be allowed to continue indefinitely.' "In
tervention In some shape or form must
"eventually^ occur. " At the moment Rus
sia' dreads 1,' any one" suggesting it, be"-;
cause therein Is involved a confession of
defeat. Â£i Should \ Port . Arthur * fall . I
"think it would.be different."
TAIjKS OF INTERVENTION.
"I understand that such attempts as
Kuropatkin made to . cut our lines of
communication appear to have been
confined to those connecting *us with
Korea. Some other military critics
seem to forget that our main lines of
communication are now with New
chwang and not with the Yalu. This is
an- Infinitely cheaper and quicker
method of transport. Our second army
lines of communication over the Yalu
to Korea were maintained only with
great difficulty and because we had no
other alternative.
"Whatever the result -of the present
/battle, whether Oyama retire to his po
sition at Liaovang or whether he force
Kuropatkin j back > toward Mukden, it
will only have a small bearing upon
the decision of the grim issues at
stake."
"Until Port Arthur falls," says the
Baron, "a proposal looking /to peace
must be futile. Defeat or victory to the
Russian Manchurian armies merely
swells the dally death roll. Kuropat
kin driven back : and utterly defeated
would simoly harden Russia's heart.
Kuropatkin .temporarily successful
would inspire new enthusiasm. In such
a see-saw the,re Is no hope of peace.
"Heretofore it has been an open ques
tion in some quarters whether Kuro
patkin's strategy was not more re
sponsible for the Russian retirement
than Japanese aggression. Kuropat
kin'has chosen to brush aside all that
doubt and make a plain Issue. Let it
be remembered that Oyama so far has
only been fighting from his first line of
defense. . Retirement to Oyama merely
means .falling : back upon his main de
fenses and base â namely, Liaovang â
where all preparations in the way of
fortifications and ammunition have
been made for a prolonged stand, In
case of '-necessity. That Oyama has
met' Kuropatkin's advance on Yantai
with a counter advance indicates a
greater state of preparedness on the
part of our forces than I expected. But
there is some doubt if Oyama could
rt/llow up any advantage gained In
irhaT* Is comparatively an open fight.
Oyama's acceptance of a general en
gagement from his first and weaker
lines implies strength, which makes
the motive of Kuropatkin's attack all
the more puzzling.
PEACE NOT IN SIGHT.
LONDON, Oct. 13.â News of the bat
tle between the Russians and Japanese
was eagerly awaited here throughout
the day at the Japanese legation. Many
inquiries were made there by Kritlsh
officials, but the Japanese authorities
were" even less informed than the
newspapers. The suspense was not
untinged with anxiety, which was
more noticeable than during any pre
vious phase of the war. Baron Hay
ashl, the Japanese Minister, said:
"The reports of our success, welcome
as they are, must not be construed as
being a forerunner of any decisive
blow. It is practically impossible for
Marshal Oyama to envelop and utterly
crush General Kuropatkin, Just as it is
practically impossible for Kuropatkin
to envelop Oyama. A victory in the
battle now raging means to us that
Kuropatkin must confess defeat, which
is important, but not decisive. He can
put forward no strategical excuses, as
at I>iaoyang. Any retreat on the part
of the Russian forces now is an open
confession to the world that tlfey have
suffered a serious reverse.
OYAMA'S STRONG POSITION.
The Iguin fuse. Invented by Vice Ad
miral Iguin, second In command of the
general staff of the Japanese navy. Its
merit lies In Its simplicity and its-cer
tainty of action at the proper time. It
Is said to exceed anything: In use by
other nations, as far as Is known. ;--,
" The Arisaka gun Is ' a three-Inch
piece, firing either common shell or
shrapnel, the latter weighing thirteen
pounds and carrying 230 balls. In ac
tion It fires four or five shots per min
ute. The breech is closed by a screw
lock. The gun weighs 1900 pounds
and with the carriage complete only
3500 pounds, giving: It great mobility.
The Arisaka rifle for Infantry *is a
modification of the Mauser, with' a
very smair caliber, .05 of an Inch less
than the Lee-Enfteld rlfls. It has

Russians make the work of their

while, on the other hand, the Japanese
have availed themselves with equally

ture, the secrets of which are sedu^

Of these new engines of war made

ing destruction to any vessel, so un
fortunate as to touch it.
The present war has developed
much ingenuity on both sides, both in
making new engines of destruction
and in applying forces and means al
ready well known to the same end.
"The Japanese are using explosives
inclosed in Boxes j and provided with
Bickford fuses, which they throw like
hand grenades. Our army is employing
similar weapons.
"Our indefatigable hero, Kondra
tenko, Is continually Inventing fresh
means of striking the enemy. The
troops continue showing heroism, the
wounded returning to the ranks with
great ardor."
Under date of October 7, General
Stoessel reports as follows:
"The Japanese have organized fresh
batteries to bombard the' inner fortress.
One of these batteries is ' composed* of
eleven-inch mortars. The bombard-"
ment is becoming more violent every
day. The enemy has received rein-,
forcements of several battalions. The
weather is cold. The spirit of the troops
is excellent and all, from the chiefs to
the lowest soldier, are eager to fight
the enemy.!'
"The Japanese, having increased the
number of their guns against the north
front, commenced an approach against
that section of the fortress on the night
of October 1, but were stopped by vol
leys. The Japanese then directed their
attack on the extreme right, assailing
Signal Hill, which is situated near the
sea, and commenced an attack from
Siaku Hill. Having repulsed our sharp
shooters, the Japanese occupied Signal
Hill. At daylight Signal Hill was
shelled by Russian artillery, after
which our companies drove off the Jap
anese and reoccupied the position.
ST. PETERSBURG, Oct. 13.â General
Stoessel, commander of the Russian
troops at Port Arthur, telegraphs that
the Russians recently recaptured Signal
Hill. He adds that the Japanese are
bombarding the interior of the fortress
with new batteries and that the bom
bardment is becoming more and more
violent. General* Stoessel's report to
the Emperor, which fs dated October 5,
is as follows:

ST. PETERSBURG, Oct. 14. 1:50 a.
m. â Desperate fighting and losses on
both sides, with varying success for
the Russiansâ euch is the summing up
of the situation by General Kuropat
kin in a telegram filed on October 13.
Theie is no sign of the battle slacken
ing- On the contrary. General Kurb
ratkin telegraphs that he has ordered
the army to resume the fight with un
abated vigor to-day. General Kuro
1'i.tkin himself is in the thickest of the
fighting, and General Sakharoff, his
chief cf staff, is personally directing
reconnolEsar.ces. The conflict has been
ltiost desperate at the center and on
ihe west fiank. The advance guards at
these points had to be repeatedly re
inforced, owing to the great pressure
t-i the Japanese attacks. At night
fall on October 12 the Russian right
was withdrawn from its main position,
but one of the abandoned positions was
retaken at the point of the bayonet
during the night.
Contrary to Field Marshal Oyama's
report no indication is given in Gener
al Kuropatkin's telegram of an envel
oping movement by General Oku. The
only positions captured by force were
at the center, where the Russians
were compelled to retire during the
afternoon. There is no mention of
the loss of guns. The War Office de
clines to deny that there was such a
less, but explains that such an incident
was quite possible while positions were
According to the latest news of the
fighting in the direction of .Benshiu the
Russians were striving ror the posses
sion of a pass, but no news was re
ceived from there yesterday. The pass
alluded to presumably is the Hu Pass,
which is mentioned in General Sakhar
off's telegram 'Of October 11. Hu Pass
is eight miles due. north of Benshui.
Should this pass fall into the hands of
the Russians it would involve the cap
ture of Benshiu, thus opening the road
to . L>iaoyang.
According to the belief of the general
staff General RennenkampfC has not
penetrated as far as the Taitse River,
but he is co-operating in the attempt
to capture Benshlu.
In the midst of anxiety and suspense
involved !n the great fight, south of
Mukden comes also the first word in
many days from the gallant defenders
of Port Arthur. While General Stoes
sel's report of the condition .of affairs
at Port Arthur is no later than October
1, it shows that the garrison at that
time was in unimpaired spirits, mak
ing a heroic defense against a series of
the most bitter assaults in all the his-

tory of Blegres. The closeness of the
righting and the deadly character of the
attacks and counter attacks are shown
by the fact that both sides are using
hand grenades, and that the Japanese,
after a bloody capture of the important
Signal station Hill, were unable to hold
the position in the race of the flre from
the fortress.
The. repeated failure of the Japanese,
to hold a_ footing once gainf d in the
circle of Inner forts is received here
with much satisfaction, as indicating
the skill with which the defenses of
the port were "constructed, the main
line of forts supporting one another
so as to render any one position almost
certainly untenable, even if tempo
rarily captured by an enemy. But the
reckless ferocity of the assaults by an
overwhelming force of Japanese seems
to make it certain that Port Arthur can
be held only by an immense expenditure
of ammunition, and it is becoming a
serious question with the authorities
how long even the great supply known
to exist in the fortress can last in the
face cf the Japanese attack.
The most serious feature of General
Stoessel's report, from a strategical
point of view, is the fact that the
Japanese have got a mortar battery in
position to bear on the inner fortress.
Emperor Nicholas held a council of
war to-day, at which, it Is believed, the
appointment of General Kuropatkln toÂ»

Not Enough Voters to Fill Offices.
SAN DIEGO, Oct. 13. â It has been
discovered that there are six precincts
in this county with not enough vot
ers in them to fill the offices on the
Election Board. In one precinct there
are but two voters. Both men are
Republicans and one has been named
as judge and the other as inspector.
One precinct had no voters registered,
hence will have no election.

Bell Addresses San Rafael Democrats.
SAN RAFAEL, Oct. 13. â The Demo
crats of Marin County held a mass
meeting here to-night and were ad
dressed by Theodore Bell. Democratic
nominee for Congress from the Sec
ond District. A fair-sized crowd was
on hand to welcome the candidate.
Bell discussed the national issues of
the campaign and was frequently ap
plauded. Joseph Silva of Napa also ad
dressed the meeting.
Louis Ferarl, Democratic candidate
for Justice of the Peace, filed a petition
with the Supreme Court yesterday
asking that the Election Commission be
directed to place his name on the offi
cial ballot. The office which Ferarl
seeks is held at present by Justice of
the Peace Golden. It is claimed by the
Democrats that Golden's term expires
this year. The official himself thinks
otherwise, and the matter will have to
be settled by the courts. Ferari's argu
ment is that his name should be voted
upon, and then there will be plenty of
time for the courts to pass upon the
merits of the dispute. The Election
Commissioners have refused to listen
to his plea, and therefore he has ap
pealed to the Supreme- Court. No de
cision was rendered yesterday. The
court will either set a day for hearing
the arguments of contestants or deny
the petition absolutely.
The looked-for petition for a writ of
mandate to compel the Election Com
mision to place the twenty-two" pro
posed amendments to the charter on the
ballot, they having, been rejected by the
commission, did not materialize. It is
probable that the proponents of the
proposed- amendments became discour
aged at the action of the Election Com
mission and decided to abandon their
fight for the present.
FERARI FILES PETITION.
Democratic Congressional candidates
Livernash and Wynn will speak- at the
Alhambra to-night at a meeting to be
held under the auspices of the Iroquois
Club. Livernash has been doing most
of his talking at outdoor meetings, and
this will be his supreme effort of thÂ£
campaign. Wynn. who is not noted as
an orator, will not be particularly con
spicuous during the evening, but he
will hold the center of the stage, no
doubt, so long as he deems it expedient.
Bonfires and a band in front of the
theater in the early part of the evening
will herald the coming of the Congres
sional candidates, and a musical pro
gramme, including songs by prominent
vocalists, will be a feature of the even-
Ing. A big crowd of voters is expected
to attend the meeting and see the cam
paign inaugurated. From to-morrow
night on the Republican candidates for
Congress will prosecute their campaign
with vigor, with every prospect of.suc
cess at the polls.
cure legislation which will give the
veterans the right to manage their own
affairs so far as pensions are con
cerned. He will go to Congress as the
representative of the people of the dis
trict. Democratic attorneys with spe
cial interests to serve cannot be trust
ed to legislate for the public.
The Republican Congressional cam
paign in San Francisco will open to
morrow night at the Alhambra Theater
with true Republican enthusiasm.
Julius Kahn and E. A. Hayes, candi
dates for Congress in. the Fourth and
Fifth districts, respectively, will deliver
the principal addresses of the evening,
though other well-known speakers will
analyze the issues of the campaign.
Through inexperience"or blundering
stupidity he inserted in the amendment
abolishing the canteen the provisions
that apply to the old regular army
Soldiers' Home at Washington, D. C,
and not the provisions relating to the
government of National Homes for
Disabled Volunteers. The law as
amended by Bell deprives the veteran
of his rigÂ«t v to demand his pension.
The national homes are entitled to
maintain canteens. The State homes
are not so favored. In the old regular
army home at Washington the veteran
is classed as an "inmate" who must
\>e treated like a child. In the nation
al home the veteran is a "member"
with all the rights and privileges at
taching to American citizenship.
Duncan E. McKinlay, who will be
elected 'to represent the Second Dis
trict in Congress, will be able to se-
For a long time Bell has been hostile
to the management of the home. His
canteen amendment was a measure of
spite. He said on the floor of the
House, as reported In the Congressional
Record, that the California manage
ment took the pension money from the
veterans and gave them canteen checks.
Congressmen from other States said
this was a shame and told Bell that
he ought to be ashamed to represent
a State that allowed such transactions.
The truth is that of $75,000 of pension
moneys handled by the treasurer, more
than $70,000 has been paid back in ac
tual cash to the veterans. Bell misled
his fellow members In the House. Such
deception called forth a defamation of
his own State. The Congressional Rec
ord contains his exact language and
the books of the treasurer contain the
exact figures- He cannot escape the
record.
Bell got $150 from this estate under al
lowance of the court.
The board has seen fit from time to
time to refuse to give information con
cerning the amount fleposited to- the
credit o? each living veteran. Not long
since an old soldier received $1200 from
the settlement of an estate in Iowa.
The sharks on the outside knew that
he was expecting the money and as
soon as he received it they persuaded
him to demand his discharge from the
home. He went away from his com
rades. His new friends on the outside
put him in a room over a Yountville
saloon and sent to Sacramento for a
lewd woman to keep him company. His
$1200 was soon spent and when his
money was gone he was kicked out
doors into the back yard, where he lay
sick, miserable and helpless until some
one sent a conveyance and had him
hauled to the steps of the comman
dant's office at the home. It is fair to
the Napa lawyers to note that they
had nothing to do with the last men
tioned case.
BELL IS HOSTILE.
Borne of the veterans dwelling at the
home have saved from their pensions
considerable sums of money. Small
lawyers on the outside view with ten
der solicitude any old soldier who has
Baved a sum exceeding $100. If the
amount saved happens -te> approximate
$1000 measures are taken to declare the
veteran incompetent. For example.
Thomas McDonnell, who had lived at
the home in peace and comfort for
fourteen years, was found to be the
possessor of $1800. the sum of $1000 be
ing to his credit with the treasurer.
The law firm of Bell, York & Bell took
great interest in the case and handled
the petition to have the old veteran
declared incompetent and a guardian
appointed for him. McDonnell was
taken from the home. Shortly after he
left the institution he died and his es
tate was recently distributed accord
ing to i will which was dated. and

Bell began his campaign for re-elec
tion by reviling the management of the
Soldiers' Home, hoping to create a side
issue and divert attention to the fact
that he was the candidate of the party
which declared protection to be rob
bery. The Republican State Central
Committee was wise and accordingly
forced Bell to stand in the open as the
nominee of the Democratic party. For
months no attention was paid to side
Issues, but since the Sacramento Bee
has descended to the desecration of the
dead to help the Democratic nominee
the committee holds that some facts of
general interest apart from strict party
lines should be stated.
The Bee, stinging itself In its mad
rage, calls for something more elab
orate and conclusive from the letters
of the stalwart Republican secretary.
The Call to-day presents the complete
text of a letter from the late Walter
S. Melick to General John F. Sheehan,
secretary of the board of directors of
the Veterans' Home, wnlch letter con
tains clear and ample proof that will
convince every fair minded voter in
the Second Congressional District that
the Bee in May last ws.s engaged in
a campaign of calumny to boost BelL
"'I know you, personally, will not hold
me responsible for the statements that
are printed in the Bee. but I write you
to aEk the other members of the board
"xv ho may think that I inspired such
statements, to withhold criticism.
When opportunity incidentally offers
Â¦will you kindly speak to General Back
us, General Stone and any others who
might possibly think I made any such
statements reflecting upon the institu
tion."
ANOTHER LETTER.
As Melick's voice was Etilled In death
the Bee no doubt supposed that the
dead could be misrepresented to malign
the living and no exposure would fol
low. Happily the Btalwart Republican
secretary of the State Board of Ex
aminers recorded his impressions of
the Bee the day after that paper, in
the interest of Bell, sought to misrep
resent the management of the home.
On May 3 Melick, in a letter to one di
rector, wrote:
On the day that Walter S. Melick
died the Sacramento Bee, hoping to ad
vance the political fortunes of Theo
dore Bell, Deinocatic nominee for Con
gress in the Second District, published
the following: "Walter S. Melick, that
stalwart Republican secretary of the
State Board of Examiners, "stated to
the Bee on May last that the board
of directors had been extravagantly

NEW YORK, Oct. 13. â Charlea
Murphy, leader of Tammany Hall,
said to-day he had sent notices to the
fifty or more candidates on the county
Democratic ticket, requesting them to
decline Indorsement by any party
other than their own.
"Democrats must be Democrats and
nothing else," said Murphy. "I am
willing to have the People's party or
any other indorse Judge Parker, but
for the minor officers, such as Assem
blymen, Congressmen, Senators, etc.,
it would not do. It would, in a way.
set them above the Presidency and it
is in the interest of Judge Parker and
his campaign that this stand has been
taken and the order issued."
At the headquarters of the Peo
ple's party in the Hoffman House to

tions would be filed with the Board of

JTST PLAIN* DEMOCRATS.
Ratification of the candidates of the
Labor Union party was the object of
the meeting held by the members of
the various labor organizations of the
city last evening at the Alhambra.
Mayor Eugene Schmitz, E. J. Liver
nash and the inevitable James Gal
lagher were among those who were
listed to speak on the subject of the
good that unions do, but there was a
breaking away from the schedule that
caused a deal of turmoil and consider
able woe when Livernash forgot that
he was at a union meeting and
began to talk promiscuous politics.
Livernash referred to President
Roosevelt as the man wjth "the clank
ing sword and the jingling spurs" and
seemed to be of the opinion that the
shadows of San Juan Hill had no being
in the campaign. He drifted from labor
to the "common people" and, finally,
to naval guns and how well they could
be made in naval gun factories.
But there was here a rub more than
Hamlet ever figured on. Mayor
Schmitz, who was popping with politi
cal enthusiasm, and James Gallagher,
who was as filled with indignation as
a seltzer bottle is filled with carbonic
acid gas, were there with a stream at
adverse opinion as to the nation's chief
executive that, when injected into the
astonished audience, made things fairly
bubble.
Thomas Egan, chairman of the coun
ty committee of the Union Labor party,
opened the meeting with well chosen
and well received, remarks. He said it
was a gathering of union labor men
and had no party significance so far
as the national administration contest
Is concerned. He then Introduced Mr.
"Williams, Union Labor candidate for
Congress. "Williams spoke of "equal
rights for all and special privileges for
none." After his talk, Livernash was
introduced and received applause. He
said that he would tell of his personal
experience In Congress and what he
had done for labors He told of the
work of the American Federation of
Labor and spoke of the efforts of Sam
uel Gompers in the interest of labor
legislation. Next he told of the man
ner of the Federal Government and the
decline of simplicity in the White
House and gave an account of the
President and the lives of his principal
chiefs, ending this particular subject
with an overhauling of the officials in
Washington in general. .
After Mr. Livernash had been seated
Mayor Schmitz arose to explain that
the meeting was not one for the dis
cussion of national issues. He said he
had understood that^ the occasion was
not for the deciding of who was the
better candidate for President, the
Democrat or the Republican. He
wished it understood clearly that he
was not in sympathy with a Demo
cratic meeting.
"I am for Theodore Roosevelt for
President," he added, "so far as I am
personally concerned."
Judge Murasky, candidate for Supe
rior Judge, was introduced and made a
short talk on unionism and politics,
after which James Gallagher â¢ arose
and reminded those present that the
Union Labor party's platform Is in
favor of no particular administration,
creed or faction.
"Why cannot we stand on this plat
form?" asked Mr. Gallagher.
"One speaker has referred to the
'clanking sword and jingling spurs/
and I cannot stand for this. "We want
to go before the country as a free peo
ple."
Mayor Schmitz closed the meeting
by saying that never before had the
opportunity been presented, except
through the Union Labor party, for
men of all parties to meet and speak in
a common cause from the same plat
form, and he was sorry that anything
had occurred to disturb. the peaceful
equilibrium of this peculiarly interest
ing social condition.
It might incidentally be remarked,
by way of a finale, that during Mr.
"Williams' and the Mayor's remarks
certain reflections were made upon the
candidacy of Mr. Wynn for Congress
in the Fifth District. Mr. "Williams al
leged that Mr. Wynn had on a certain
occasion betrayed the Union Labor
party, and that he had done so with
a view to supporting Franklin K^ Lane
and subsequently getting the nomina
tion from the Democrats at this year's
convention.
Senator Fairbanks was followed by
Speaker Cannon. Cannon compared
the conditions existing under a Repub
lican administration with those which
existed during President Cleveland's
administration, and said that all he
asked for was that the people choose
for themselves and it was easy to
prophesy what the result would be.
Our opponents say that the money question
has bÂ«en Irrevocably settled. This is not ex
actly the fact, as Congress may reverse and
undo it to-morrow if it sees fit. but such a
thing will never happen as long as the Re
publican party Is In power. To insure the
fixture of the money question it U necessary
for the Republican party to have a majority
in Congress, and this fact should not be lost
sight of during the campaign, . .
From my observations during my trip to the
Pacific Coast I can assure you In, good faith
that If the conditions throughout the West
can bo taken as a criterion of the sentiment
throughout the country, then the Republican
party will record a greater victory this year
than it did four years ago. But the people
must not become apathetic. To avoid a repeti
tion of the conditions which existed during
the four years between 1892 and 1896. when the
United States, under the administration of the
Democratic party, was plunged into almost
total demoralization, every loyal Republican
must stand by hla party this year and roll
up such a majority for the Republican prin
ciples in the Congressional districts that when
Congress opens for the next sesston such an
overwhelming Republican majority will be
found In their seats that it will be useless for
our opponents to endeavor to enact visionary
legislation.
Standing here to-night where William Me-
Klnley. our martyred President. onece ad
dressed you. the best greeting- I can extend
to you Is that Theodore Roosevelt, the leader
of the Republican party, to-day stands exactly
for the same principles as President MeKlnley.
and those principles will not be changed on*
lota when President Roosevelt Is returned to
the White House on November 8.
To add to the enthusiasm of the gath
ering Joseph G. Cannon. Speaker of
the House of Representatives, ad
dressed the audience in his character
istic manner.
Senator Fairbanks said in part:
CHICAGO. Oct. 13.â Completing a
day of speech-making throughout Illi
nois Charles W. Fairbanks, the Repub
lican candidate for Vice President, to
night addressed an audience that filled
the First Regiment Armory to over
flowing. This was the first time that
Senator Fairbanks has spoken here
since he received the nomination, and
so much enthusiasm was manifested by
his listeners that the meeting resem
bled to a great extent the vigorous
rallies of 1896 aftd 1900.
phasize and make a national issue of
this point because of its varied indus
tries eivinff employment to artisans of

Injunction has been used here in la
bor disputes in a number of instances.
Another new point as a Democratic
argument was also made by Mr. Hillâ
the election of United States Senators
by direct vote of the people.
Wheeling's reception to Davis and
party made it necessary to hold two
meetings to-night. A large circus tent
was not adequate to accommodate the
gathering and Carroll Club Hall was
hastily secured and as quickly filled,
leaving many persons still unable to
get in.

again to make good the accusation
against the inspector, who was already
in prison under the drastic process of
the police and their detinue book.
The foreman returned to the Jury
room and then and there was more hot
talk. The rupture finally became wide
and deep and a dispostion not to
trifle asserted itself. It was decided
not to reopen the testimony, and be
fore the witnesses arrived the door
swung open and the Jurors were ready
to go before Judge Sloss, who was
holding court near by.
All came out with the exception of
O'Brien, Drucker and Welch. Lilien
feld remained at the door until the
eleven Jurors had emerged, and then
gaw the stern command to Bailiff
Hamiuto '-./.
Hamilton A. Dobbins:
"Keep those men in there; don't you
let them get away."
The policeman locked them In the
room and the three members of - the
Grand Jury were held prisoners.
Before Judge Sloss a roll call was
taken and only eleven jurors re
sponded.
"We have an indictment to present
that was regularly found on Tuesday
night," ' said Foreman Lilienfeld, "but
a minority of the Grand Jury now seek
to block out business and prevent its
presentation to court by refusing to at
tend its return. Under these circum
stances I ask that the court order the
attendance of the Jurors and have the
bailiff bring them in."
Judge Sloss complied with the re
quest at once and a deputy Sheriff a
few minutes later appeared with
Messrs. O'Brien, Drucker and Welch.
Meantime Grand Juror McLane had
arrived, so there were fifteen Grand
Jurors present, and the presentation of
the indictment .was made. /

KALAMA. Wash., Oct. 13.â That M.
Kelley was never mistreated by white
caps, but was instead trying to impose
upon his fiancee and the public gener
ally, is the accusation of Sheriff Hunt
ington, who has returned after an in
vestigation of Kelley'6 story. The
Sheriff savs that the knots which had
bound Kelley to the tree for four days,
as he said, were tied so loosely that he
could have escaped at any time. Fur
thermore, Kelley outwalked his res
cers to Kelso and showed no signs of
a breakdown until after a hearty meal.
The Sheriff's explanation is that Kel
ley did not have sufficient money to be
married with in the style be wished,
and believed his sweetheart. Miss Lulu
Ward, would quickly marry him if her
sympathies were aroused. This was
true, for the girl obtained the license
herself. Though Kelley had been in the
woods four days, according to his story,
the Sheriff says his clothes were not
soiled.

Goldberg has been living in the
house for about five weeks. He says
his wife is In Seattle. He professes not
to know anything" about Stevens.
Policemen Pearl and Keohane arrtv*
ing, 'sent Goldberg to the Central Emer
gency Hospital, where a wound on his
scalp and a cut on his hand were
stitched and dressed. A knife was found
at the foot of the lounge in Goldberg's
room and a black mask in the hallway
outside. Nothing was taken from Gold
berg, but he asserts that his assailant
attempted to steal his diamond stud.
Detective Coleman was detailed on
the case and he is satisfied that the
man known as Stevens committed the
assault upon Goldberg and had been
waiting for several days for the op
portunity. Stevens engaged a room
adjoining Goldberg's last Friday night-
He said he was a drummer for a dry
goods house In Portland. This is all
that is known 'about him. In his hurry
to escape he left his hat and rain coat
in his room. He is described as about
30 years of age, 5 feet 10 inches tall,
smooth face, dark complexion and wore
a dark sack suit.
Goldberg reached his room about 2:30
o'clock yesterday morning and while
he was in the act of striking a match
to light the gas some one said with an
oath, "I've got you now." Goldberg
received a violent blow on the head
from a blunt Instrument. This stun
ned him for an Instant, but he grap
pled with his assailant, who was arm
ed with a knife. Goldberg, during the
struggle, knocked the knife out of his
assailant's hand, cutting his own hand.
After a desperate fight Goldberg suc
ceeded in opening a window in the
rear. His cries for help alarmed the
desperado, who released his hold of
Goldberg, permitting him to step out
of the window to the roof of a kitchen,
where he was seen by Charles Wood,
the laniard. Wood ran back and on the
stairs met and grappled with a man
hurrying down. The man said, "If Â»
me, Stevens, I am going for a police
man, as there is a fight upstairs."
Wood released his hold and Stevens
disappeared and has not returned.
Joseph Goldberg, a cigar manufac
turer, had an exciting experience early
yesterday morning with a desperado in
his room on the second floor of a lodg
ing-house at 407 O'Farrell street.
Whether the attack upon Goldberg was
for the purpose of revenge or robbery
the police have not yet been able to
determine.

On reaching the end of his Journey,
completely exhausted and suffering ter
rible agony, Willard fainted. While
hunting Willard saw the bear in the
underbrush and fired a shot which
struck bruin on the right side of the
head and glanced off. This served to
infuriate the beast, which charged
Willard. When he attempted to throw
another cartridge into the chamber the
shell jammed and the next instant the
beast was upon him, striking him a
fearful blow in the chest, which knock
ed him flat. Willard was so dazed by
the blow that he can remember noth
ing only that he drew his revolver and
fired blindly at the bear as it came for
him the second time. The bullet sped
true, for when Willard regained con
sciousness the animal was dead.

BTOCKTON, Oct. 13.â Judge Smith
of the Superior Court of this county
gendered a decision to-day which is of
considerable importance to the people
of the State In general, as its effect
is to designate who shall have the
right to institute proceedings looking
to the condemnation of private prop
erty for public use.
F. J. Ryan, the Commissioner of
Public Works, recently brought suit
against I,ydia M. Sperry and others to
condemn a right of way for a divert
ing canal to carry off the flood waters
to the east of Stockton. The United
States Government had appropriated
a large sum of money for building the
canal, with the understanding that the
right of way should be furnished. The
last Legislature appropriated $60,000 to
buy the right of way, and deeds to all
but a small portion of the right have
been secured. Others declined to ac
cept the valuation placed upon their
holdings, hence the suit.
A demurrer was filed, in which the
contention was made that 'Commis
sioner Ryan was not the proper party
to bring the action, but the court held
that in view of the fact that the law
did not designate who might bring the
action public policy would be sub
served by designating that the Com
missioner had the right to thus .main
tain eminent domain. It is understood
that there will be no further technical
difficulties In the way of constructing
the canal, the amount of damages be
ing all there is for the courts to deter
mine.

If John C. Fisher, discoverer of the
famous "Florodora" sextet, the "Cham
pagne" dancers in "TJie Silver Slipper."
and various other types of attractive
womanhood, should chance to be in the
place of the representative who is at
present in Frisco using his efforts to
remind people that "San Toy" is com
ing and that Mr. Fisher will present it
with James T. Powers and other cel
ebrities at the Columbia Monday night,
there is a pretty even cnance that he
would organize another "San Toy"
company for the accommodation of the
many Frisco girls who have sought
to attach themselves to the payroll of
the Chinese-English musical comedy.
The "San Toy" agent arrived here
a week ago and since then has had no
time to attend to the routine business.
From the moment he reaches the Co
lumbia in the morning all of his time is
occupied in telling a string of stage
struck maidens that there "is nothing
doing." Dozens of girls have applied
for positions.
An ambitious beauty who signs her
name Lucile Lewis is one of the many
pretty girls that have applied for po
sitions in the "San Toy company."

But Burkhardt called on the Salva
tion Army captain to prove his identity
and the sleuth was arrested.
But McCarthy, thÂ£ sleuth, was not so
easily deceived. Had he not seen the
picture of Stillwell in the book? . And
Burkhardt somewhat resembled Still
well.
ST. LOUIS, Oct. 13.â James McCar
thy, aged 20, a farmhand from Fresno,
Cal., and a' would-be detective, who
was arrested yesterday for capturing
a law abiding citizen, was discharged
to-day in a City Hall Police Court by
Judge Tracy, who administered the fol
lowing advice:
" "These correspondence schools for
detectives are bred by dime novels. If
you believed you had superior detec
tive ability, which I doubt, you should
have applied for work on some metro
politan police' force. However, I be
lieve you meant no harm and you .are
discharged, but, believe me, your great
est profit will come by sticking to the
plow."
* McCarthy reached St. Louis two
weeks ago with $300 and a burning am
bition to track great criminals to their
lairs and get the big rewards offered
for their arrest. He had always worked
on a farm, but after reading detective
literature became convinced he was
cut out for a detective.
He saw an advertisement of a de
tective assc-ciation asking for opera
tives and sent for the association's
book. He received several pamphlets,
among them- being a book of halftone
portraits of notorious criminals wanted
by the police, to each of whom was at
tached a large reward.
McCarthy studied these pictures, im
pressing the features of each indelibly
on his mind, then went forth to earn
the rewards. At Ninth and Market
streets he saw a man standing in the
doorway of the Salvation Army bar
racks. "Ah ha!" he murmured, "John
Simpson, alias StiUwell, burglar and
escaped convict. - Soon I will have the
darbies on you, my man, and you will
be the prisoner of James McCarthy,
the boy detective."
These were the .thoughts that flashed
through his mind, according to his con
fession to-day in court. Nonchalantly
he approached the man in the doorway
and tapped him upon the shoulder.
"Hist," he exclaimed. "Come with
me; I am McCarthy, the sleuth. Jack
Stillwell, I have you at last."
"Unhand me," replied the man, his
black brows coming together in an
angry frown. "I am not Jack -JJtHI
well. I am just plain John Burkhardt,
citizen of good renown, lodging with
the Salvation Army."

esters on the first of January next
ehows that California is entitled to
another representative.
The committee on finance recom
mended an appropriation of 5500 for the
benefit of the Royal Foresters and $100
for the Guard of Honor. Both recom
mendations were adopted. An appro
priation of $300 for assisting picnics
was stricken out, as was also an ap
propriation of J25 for the high secre
tary, both matters being considered too
Jocal in their character.
The high court dues will remain at
?1 per month.
The northern jurisdiction proceeded
to the election of officers, taking where
possible the officers elected on Wednes
day, the result showing as follows:
SAX DIEGO. Oct. 11â Important ac
tion was taken by the High Court of
Foresters to-night when it was de
cided to divide the jurisdiction of Cali
fornia and form two high courts. The
dividing line is to be along the north
ern boundary of Monterey, San Benlto,
Fresno and Inyo counties. The fight of
the night was made over Fresno. The
raisin growers wanted to go in the
northern division and the north wanted
Fresno, but so did the south and, as the
south had the votes, Fresno remained
In the southern jurisdiction.
The morning session was devoted to
the election of supreme representatives.
There were forty candidates and only
eight to be elected. Those elected were:
R. E. Wirsching. Los Angeles; O. S.
Cooper, Vallejo; J. P. Murphy, San
Francisco: E. M. Cameron, San Fran

. "At one point several battalions .of
Japanese attempted to surround two of
our companies, but the Veroiuki regi
ment, coming gallantly to the lescue,
brought the Japanese under a heavy
fire. The Japanese thereupon raised a
Red Cross flag and*began to swear in
Russian, shouting, 'Stop shooting, you
are killing your own men.'
"The Veronski regiment paused,
though they were certain that they had
made no mistake.- having seen a Japa
nese signal meaning 'send up reserves.'
"Shifting their ground, the Veronski
regiment noured- in fresh volleys upon
the Japanese flank and rear, at 'a ranse
of thirty-five to fifty yards. The* ground
was covered with dead Japanese and
the remainder tied in confusion. Our
soldiers shouted their satisfaction at
having punished the Japanese for a
trick they have so often played \\hen
in a close corner. The VeronBki regi
ment, however, did not retire soon
enough, for the Japanese reserves com
ing up caught them In a heavy, cross
fire, under which they suffered consid
erably."
MUKDEN, Wednesday, Oct. 12.â A
Russian correspondent sends the fol
lt/wing:
"Oh October 10 1 we were forced to
retire somewhat from Yentai. At 11 p.
m. a skirmish commenced which lasted
throughout the night. At 5 o'clock yes
terday morning: we again advanced and
a desperate battle, with varying suc^
cess, raged all day. First we would
take a position and the Japanese' would
recover it. To the west of the railway
the Japanese advanced steadily and
drcn-e us from a village that we had
occupied all day, but in the evening
we reattacked, drove out the Japanese
and pushed our advance still farther
southward. This is the last news re
ceived from this portion of th'e field.
"A terrible fight also occurred east
of the railway. Here also we advanced
on Yentai, but have not yet captured it,
though we hope to get it shortly. The
Japanese must be credited with the
fact that they contended every inch
marvelously. Every inch of ground
they lost was soaked in blood. Our
troops not only fought with cc-urage,
but with unprecedented coolness. It
was never necessary to send them for
ward; they rushed upon the Japanese
of their own accord. Though the at
tack everywhere had to be carried out
under a cloud c-f bullets and shells, the
men remained impassive in the face of
the most severe punishment. Of one
company only seventeen remained â
every officer had been killed and a
private soldier commanded the rem
nant. We first attacked with the bay
onet,* but the Japanese avoided hand
to-hand fighting whenever they could,
mowing us down with shell "and ma
chine gun fire and, if this failed to
stop our rush, they evacuated the posi
tion, throwing hand-grenades and cov
ering thÂ£ captured positions with a
hail of shells and shrapnel from their
nearest batteries. Thus we suffered
heavy losses, but, strange to say, few
were killed, by far the greater number
being wounded.
"Several squadrons of Japanese cav
alry and two battalions of infantry
were wiped out in attempting a flank
ing movement. They tried to work
around our rear, but were cut off, and
our volleys gradually decimated ilieir
ranks. No Japanese reached our lin'is
or returned to his own.

Miss Barstow is not a society girl in the
full acceptance of the term, having devoted all j
her time to the cultivation of a very beautiful
voice and to tha study of music generally.. She
,is both clever and charming and tha center
of an admiring coterie of friends.
"The guests to-day were members of # -a
"mothers' and' daughters' ", club. . which has
enjoyed several seasons and at. the close of the
games â they play 500 â a delicious collation was
served on the small card tables. -J- ' Â¦
Among those who participated In . a delight
ful afternoon were Mrs. Owens and her daugh

Mrs. Swales and Mrs. . La Fave.
Aa stated this morning. Miss Barstow is
Mrs. GhlrardelU's | sister and their mother Is
Mrs. L. R. Barstow of this city. The wedding
will follow close upon New Tear's day and the
Interim promises to ba filled with a merry
round of complimentary affairs for the bride,
as she has so many relatives and friends here.
Miss Barstow is a niece of George W. Reed
and so related to Mrs. Olive Reed Cushman
and Mra. : Howard Swales. The Reeds are all
still in mourning for poor Mrs. Danforth, how
ever, so can do nothing in a social way.
Of course, now you want to hear something
about the man In tha case. He comes of an
excellent Livermore family, and those who
know him say he is a fine fellow. His father
la R. Hunter, a pioneer of the Livermore Val
ley and one of the well-to-do and Influential
citizens of that , locality. Young Mr. Hunter
haa been In this city but a short time and Is
In the employ of the Contra Costa Water Com
pany.
Perhaps that Isn't Just exactly what tne
poet said, but the sentiment Is certainly famil
iar to most of us. This morning' I insinuated
that I Miss Barstow had - happy secret that
she was about to share with her friends and
Io! this afternoon the prophecy was fulfilled.
When the little band of Invited guests filed
into Mrs. Ghirardelll'a cozy home to-day the
first object that attracted their attention was a
double hoop, entwined with soft 'greens, hang-
Ing from the grill across the round corner win
dow. In the hoops were two white billing
doves, each carrying a white heart, "Jessie"
being. written on one and on the other "John."
In this quaint, pretty fashion was the .n
gagement of Miss Jessie "Barstow and John
Hunter announced. The guests were all old
friends anB the congratulations that were
showered upon Miss Barstow thrilled with a
hearty sincerity.

The costumes and accessories,
brought by Miss Barrows from the
East, are rich and beautiful, and the
stage pictures will not soon, be for
gotten by those who seÂ« them. In
general, though the illness of Miss
Barrows is lamentable, yet the young
actors feel that If she should by great
good fortune be able to drive to the
theater on Saturday morning she
would not be ashamed of the perform
ance.
Rehearsals for "Ajax" continue
successfully, in suite of the severe loss
the play haa sustained from the ill
ness of M'ss Barrows. Much had
been accomplished before Miss Bar
rows caught her cold (which has
since develosed Into a severe conges
tion of the luncs). and the zeal and
energy of the other actors, and of
Professor J. T. Allen, who succeeds
Miss Barrows in the management,
promise to make good most of the
deficiencies. Dewing la an ideal Ajax.

pitiful sight as he sat in a cell and
told the story of the tragedy. ' ,-,< Â¦
it happened. He said: "*
"I was standing across the street
when the couple drove up and heard
the report of a revolver. I hastened
,to the scene and found the woman
lying in a pool of blood on her door
step with Bales standing over her, try
ing to stop the flow of blood with the
p*alm of his hand. She was uncon
scious and failing rapidly.
"We took her inside the house and I
made a hasty examination. I discov
ered that the bullet had entered the
lower part of the abdomen, ranged up
ward and then made its exit , through
the lumbar region.. Death was caused
from internal and external hemor
rhages. The woman was too far gone
to make a statement and did not re
gain consciousness."
Dr.' Louis C. Jacobs.'V physician con
nected with' the German Hospital, was
the only person near' the scene of the
shooting. He was standing across the
street nearly opposite where the trag
edy took place, and when he heard the
shot he .hastened to the woman's as
sistance. Dr. Jacobs did not see how
.The weapon was discharged, the
bullet striking the* unfortunate woman
in the femoral artery. She fell to
the ground with a shriek of pain and
Bales quickly ran to her assistance.
A. physician was summoned, but his
efforts to save the life of "the woman
were futile, for she . passed away in
half an hour without regaining .con
sciousness.' ' '-'â¢â¢--â¢ : * â - Â¦ - Â¦ -
According to- Bales' tale Mrs.
Eneelberger stepped out of the rig
and he was about to' follow her when
his 45-caliber revolver* fell from the
inside pocket of his overcoat and hit
the curbstone.
Mrs. Annie Engelberger, a divorced
woman, 35 years old, swiftly bled < to
death in front of her home, 50 Portola
street, shortly after 10 o'clock last
night. â¢ The woman died from the ef
fects of a pistol wound which pierced
the femoral artery. - Whether she was
shot to death by her lover, Ernest N.
Bales, or died as the result of an acci
dent remains to be proved. Bales Is in
custody and tells a straight story of
accidental shooting, which the police
believe.
The death of the woman was tragic
as well as dramatic She had been out
riding with Bales during the after
noon, and, shortly after 10 o'clock the
coupje returned to the woman's
home, where they had been living to
gether for several months as husband
and wife.

their csÂ«fdaees asd passed away have coma

as though tils city is getting the worst of It.
Complaints are coming in frost ail directions.
Elck people are xnade sicker and well people
are made sick. Tbe people are becoming
aroused aad unless something is done to alle

radical action. That Alameda with her popu

without saying.
Tbe roadbed li a disgrace to modern civtliia-

everything la favorable tha cars follow the

ALAMEDA, Oct. 13.â Repeated com
plaints made to the City Trustees by
the Alameda Advancement Association
and the West End Improvement Asso
ciation about the alleged dangerous
condition of the roadbed of the local
lines of the Oakland Transit Consoli
dated have led the municipal legisla
tors to order the City Clerk to write
the management of the corporation
concerning the matter. ' That official to
day addressed the following letter to
General Manager Kelly:
No doubt you are Informed as to the condi

character of service rendered, but it Is poestbln
that you are misinformed as to the sentiment
of the people of Alameda.
Deepite acitaUon in this ooontry for PhUlp
piae iBfiependenc*. the question Is absolutely
Irayracticatte. The Islands will not become ln
<5Â«5>endent. If we desert them others will at
</nce take our place. They will do what wt
fall to do As a whole the is'.ar.i* can only
t*oef.t by the rule of an enlightened nation and
wosld lc*Â« ty independence.
P-ezions such as the Philippine* are to-day
cot able to become Independent- Tbe advant
&Â£?Â¦ of control become apparent when a bar
barian nation Is Kberally managed by soma
er.lirfatcEed neighbor. This is not true In a
case like Finland. Lower people develop and
gain by contact with their enlightened protec
tors. They learn a modern language, modern
laws and modern social conditions. There Is
no real connection between personal liberty and
political freedom. In eplte of the exactions of
the Dutch la Java, there is more liberty and
tndT^cdenoe there than In states where people
are under the. control of native princes. If the
rule of a reckless or eemi-barbarous Govern
&ect is extended over other nations nothing
is raised, but if a good government rets con
trol of an uncirtli*Â»d land good only results.
Political wisdom is necessary. Spain was
never politically wise, yet the Filipinos owe
their b*rt traits to the Spaniards. They laid
away tribal allegiance and wars and took Ju*t
.-:Â»Â¦:â¢â¢ toward unity. Schools were established
and young Filipino* received education in Eu
fi*aa cu*tcrcÂ» and laws. The church swept
away dfl ideas and traditions asd opened the
way fcr better times and government.
Under American rule education in the Phil
ippines ha* advanced and started on new ana
better linn. No reason for stepping this con
trol naÂ« bÂ«Â«n offered. It \r safe to may that
if tb* ls'acds were abandoned they would go
back to their former conditions. .
Tie Â«rtrÂ«ne of liberalism is ihown In the
Philirpines No line Is drawn between the
American anÂ« Asiatic. The questions of the
status of mixed blood do net appear. Cm* law,
en* court and one church exist for all. Any
office may be held by any one who is able to
get the votes. The legislation is to reft wllh
leiri*!a.tlve aMercblle*. Insular constabulary
maintain* peace. American rupreciacy guar
antee* absence cf invasion, and the Filipino Is
to-day better eff than he ever was before.
If CcEgrew ia its wisdom doe* not with to
turn a Territory into a f-tate there Is r.o power
to force Congress. Therefore an we have al
ways practically held colonies, there is no rea
â¢on why we should not indefinitely continue to
to so. Oar institution* will not suffer from
contact with the islands any more than did
England rafter from contact with her colonies.
On the other hand, the islands will benefit
greatly frcni contact with us.

Grove was present when the appeal
was read and the vote taken, biit he'
took no part In the proceedings and
made no comment on the decision.
The following committee and confer
ence boards were appointed to-day:
The action of tha conference was the
result of an appeal by Grove from the
verdict of expulsion rendered by the
Fresno District Conference; which was
sustained by the annual conference in
July of this year. The case dates back
to 1902, when Grove's first wife was
granted a divorce from him on the
grounds of cruelty and desertion. A
year, later Grove married again, and
shortly afterward - charges of immor
ality were preferred against him. They
were sustained' by the Fresno District
Conference.
Grove appealed and his case was tried
at the meeting of the annual confer
ence on January 14, 1904. The verdict
of the district conference was sus
tained. Then Grove appealed' to the
present conference, with disastrous re
sults.
After the appeal had been read the
Rev. J. A. Batchelor of San Joaquln
district, who acted as president at both
the former trials, reviewed the case.
He said that the trials had been fair
and that he could see no reason why
the verdicts should not be sustained.
At the close of Mr. Batchelor's address
the Rev. J. J. N. Kenny of Fresno made
a strong argument In favor of denying
the appeal. In conclusion he said:
Tills la a time when the church cannot af
ford to temporize on this question. The ease
with which divorces are secured threaten* the
home life of the nation. The nine- men who
tried this case are men. of Integrity and intel
ligence; who love" their homes, and they say
that the accused Is not a. fit man to present
the cospel. We cannot afford .to tafc* any
other action. ; i
Because It was proven that he had In
duced his wife to obtain a divorce that
he might be free to marry another
woman, M. F. Grove, former pastor of
the MethodiBt Episcopal Church South
of VisaJia, was dropped from the min
istry and membership in the church to
day. The decision was at a conference
at Ashbury Church, this city. The ex
pulsion of Grove was made final by the
unanimous vote of the pastors of sixty
four churches.

Supervisors Continue Attempt to
Prove That tlie Yorke Company's
Bills Are Excessive.
The Supervisors* Finance Commit
tee yesterday resumed its investiga
tion into the bills .of the F. M. Yorke
Company on its contract for repairing
bituminous pavements.
Henry Bladgen, former superintend
ent of the company, who was dis
charged, testified that the concern
had apparatus with which 3000 square
feet of pavement could be laid daily.
The committee figured that at that
rate only 78,000 square feet could
have been laid during the entire
month of August and thought it
strange that bills for the resurfacing
of. 104,000 square feet had been pre
sented by the Yorke Company.
Inspector Botfne testified as to the
method of inspection to ascertain the
quantity and quality of the work done.
City Engineer Woodward was pre
pared to give evidence that the plant
of the company has a capacity of
9000 square feet a day, but he was not
called to the witness stand. Yorke
offered to put down between 6000 and
7000 square feet of 2%-inch bitumen
on the street in front of the Phelan
building at 23 cents a foot, but the of
fer was declined.
The committee concluded its inves
tigation and will file a report with the
board next Monday, as it does not de
sire to hold the bills up any longer
than necessary.
Town Talk.
The literary and news features of this
week's Town Talk are .of exceptional
quality and unusual interest. The Saun
terer deals with some queer aspects of
registration and tells of a dinner given
to Senator Bard at which Collector Strat
ton was a guest. He al3o tells why Sau
salito was interested in the Wood di
vorce case and why the defendant was
reinstated in his position. He explains
the solicitude of Herman Oelrichs'
friends, and why Captain Rowan rebelled
against the strenuous hospitality of his
wife's friends. He tells of a society
girl's romance, gives the details of a Bo
hemian Club contretemps, comments on
a Judge's grewsome stunt at a Cosmos
Club dinner and sheds light on the trans
port frauds. In this breezy number
Theodore Bonnet discusses "The Profes
sional Reformer," Edward Clough con
tinues his castigation of the missiona
ries, that distinguished stylist. Harry
Cornell, writes of "Playing the Fool," and
there is an entertaining illustrated arti
cle of interest to automobile enthusiasts.
Two Sailors Suffocated.
Alturo Cuper and J. Laban, appren
tices on the. Chilean training ship
Baquedano, were overcome by the
fumes of illuminating gas yesterday
morning in a lodging-house at 301
Montgomery avenue and before their
condition was discovered Cuper was
dead and Laban unconscious. Laban
was removed to the Harbor Hospital
and the "body of Cuper was taken to
the Morgue. They engaged the room
and retired between 2 and 3 o'clock in
the morning. At half past 10 o'clock
the landlord, P. Ronoquiere, detected
the odor of escaping gas and forced
an entrance. .
permitted to value their importations
in accordance with the rates of their
competitors in these ' particular in
stances. Whether rebates can be se
cured is an open question.
Through two rulings of the Board of
General Appraisers at New York three
mercantile houses in this city consider
themselves out and Injured in large
amounts as compared with business
competitors who succeeded in getting
comparatively low rates of duty on im
ported bird seed. The difference was
brought about by different methods of
valuation. The story connected with the
transactions is of more than ordinary
interest as it is told by merchants.
S. L. Jones & Co., Maldonado & Co.,
Haas Brothers, Balfour, Guthrie & Co.
and J. H. Boden, the last named being
a broker, imported bird seed in large
quantities on vessels that arrived at
this port in March and April last. S. L.
Jones & Co. had two lots of seed. The
dates of exportation from Liverpool,
which is the bird seed market of the
world, ranged from September 17, 1903.
to December 1, 1903. The vessels ar
rived at this port in March and April,
1904.
There is a customs regulation, one of
many prepared by the Secretary of the
Treasury Department, that provides in
interpretation of the laws governing the
collection of customs duties of the
United States that "it Is the duty of the
Appraiser, or officer acting as such, to
make careful examination of any mer
chandise which the Collector designates
for that purpose and to appraise the
actual market value or wholesale price
thereof at the time of exportation in
the principal markets and in the cur
rency of the country whence the same
was imported." Another provision made
by the Secretary of the Treasury is
that "the time of exportation must be
deemed the date at which merchandise
actually leaves the foreign port."
DIFFERING COURSES.
When the lots of bird seed referred
to arrived at San Francisco the import
ers pursued different courses. S. L.
Jones & Co. after sending a cablegram
to Liverpool to ascertain the regular
market price of bird seed on the sailing
day of the vessel that brought their
imported goods voluntarily raised the
valuation from the rates at which they
bought it to the quoted price on the day
of the sailing of the vessel. This in
volved a difference in the duty of some
thing like $1400. Haas Brothers and
Balfour, Guthrie &- Co. raised the valu
ations on their goods similarly. Maldo
nado & Co. and Boden, when the valu
ation on their bird seed. was raised by
Appraiser John T. Dare, concluded to
fight the matter, out before the Board
of General Appraisers at New York.
The value of bird seed in the Liverpool
market had been rising steadily for
some time before any of the seed in
question was dispatched for this port,
and the differences between _the pur
chase prices and the real market values
on the days of exportation were con
siderable in all the cases in question.
Maldonado & Co. and Boden appealed
from the increase in valuation by the
Appraiser to the Board of General Ap
praisers. On the first hearing of the
facts one member of the Board of Gen
eral Appraisers decided in favor of
Maldonado & Co. and Boden. The case
was then brought up on review before
the Board of General Appraisers by
reason of action at this end of the line,
and the result was that three of the
General Appraisers sustained the opin
ion and decision of the one General Ap
praiser who first considered the matter,
and so it was settled that Maldonado &
Co. and Boden should have their bird
seed at a lower rate of valuation for
the assessment of customs duties than
the other three business houses that
have been named herewith.
CREATES MUCH INTEREST.
There Is much interest in the issue of
the case among commercial houses. By
the lower rates of valuation two houses
are able to make a lower price for bird
seed than their competitors. There Is
some irritation, but as Haas Brothers,
Balfour, Guthrie & Co. and S. L. Jones

The University of California has
been awarded some important prizes
for its exhibits in the Educational
Building. Some of these are supposed
to be grand prizes, though no public
announcement has been made. The
Lick Observatory display and the pho
tographic work in connection with it
are said to have been given the high
est honors.
The forestry exhibit of California, got
together by W. H. Mills, Commissioner
Filcher and Thomas Hatch, has been
awarded a grand prize.
Certain shortcomings in the way of
labeling and preparing wine for ship
ment have been brought prominently
to the front at this fair, and the result
of this will also be a benefit to the in
dustry in California.
Dr. Metz, head of the chemistry de
partment of the Tulane University of
New Orleans, called on Superintendent
Haber of the Calif ornia wine exhibit
this week and expressed his approval
of the vintages of that State by
placin? a large order for his private
callar. He praised the wines highly.
Dr. Metz was in California for seven
teen weeks in the interests of his uni
versity and Louisiana, and was greatly
pleased with the Golden State.
From the wine Jury California will
get four grand prizes, seventeen gold
medals and a score of silver and
bronze medals â a pretty good show
ing.
FOUR GRAND PRIZES.
George E. Hyde and Loyd Childs,
who represent Santa Clara County at
the fair, are working hard to promote
the consumption of prunes and gain
knowledge concerning the Eastern sales
of this fruit. The crowds that gather
to sample the cooked prunes given
away at the Santa Clara booth grow
greater every day. Hyde and Childs
make the statement, which at first
seems funny, that the men who sell
prunes in the Eastâ the retail grocers
are the men who obstruct their sale.
They charge too much for them, and
instead of becoming.a reasonable priced,
popular article of diet the prune
is looked upon by the masses of East
ern people as a luxury. The middle
man in this case is not to blame. The
retailers want too much profit, and
they demand from 12% to 15 cents a
pound for prunes they get for less than
half those prices. If the retail prices
ran nearer the wholesale figures many
more prunes would be eaten, to the ad
vantage of the grower.
Henry I.achman. who gained the title
of "The Peacemaker" during his serv
ice on the international wine jury
here, has .departed for the East and
will soon be back in California, Lach
man has done good work here for his
State. The prestige he gained through
his ability to pour oil on breakers and
smooth out numerous disputes' that
arose among the jurors gave him an
influence that benefited his State
greatly. He also learned many things
here that will be an aid to producers
of and dealers in wine when imparted
to them.
EDUCATE THE PEOPLE.
"People can easily be educated to eat
raisins," said Commissioner Wyer, "and
to use them in a great many dishes
where they are not used now. The con
sumption per capita of raisins can be
greatly raised by proper distribution of
samples."
When the fair first opened strong ef
forts were made to secure 100 tons of
Fresno raisins for distribution to those
who visited it. Some supported and
some opposed the project, and it was
finally dropped despite the advice given
by Charles F. Wyer. the Fresno County
commissioner, that it would be profit
able to carry it out. Now, when the fair
is in its closing weeks, Fresno has de
cided to send the raisins. Commissioner
Wyer has written back that 100 tons
cannot be judiciously distributed at this
late date and that about twenty tons
should be sent. These will be given
away at the Fresno exhibit and at the
California building in quarter-pound
packages.

WORLD'S FAIR, ST. LOUIS, Oct. 13.â
Fresno County, which produces nearly
all the raisins used in the United States
and has more on hand than she can sell
to advantage, has at last awakened to
the importance of advertising her lead
ing product at the fair and getting
samples into the hands" of those who
may become consumers. This county is
preparing to send to the World's Fair
large quantities of raisins to be dis
tributed as aamples.

Mr. Nelson sullenly retuiuied to the

"It would give me infinite pleasure,"
said Judge Mogan to Mr. Nelson, "to

tar. Much as she had learned to ad
mire Mr. Hermann as a wooer her be
lief in the permanency of husbandly
devotion had been somewhat shaken
by her experience as Sirs. Fritz. In
deed, when she decided to take unto
herself a second spouse there was ques
tion in her mind as to whether com
plete felicity could possibly outlive the
honeymoon period of any matrimonial
union. But she was pleased. to inform
Police Judge Cabaniss, before whom
she was charged with battery, that
she had never had occasion to regret
the fateful moment when ' she surren
dered to Mr. Hermann's ardent plead
ing by whispering "Yes." Since then
her life has been very happy. It would
be entirely unshadowed if Mr. Fritz
were to cease persecuting her- Couldn't
the court compel him to let her aloneâ
to forget her as thoroughly as she fails
to remember him when he is outside
her range of vision, and she is not re
ceiving anonymous letters of which he
is undoubtedly the author?
The specific complaint, sworn to by
Mr. Fritz, accused Mrs. Hermann of
slapping his face in the foyer of the
Central Theater the previous evening.
With her husband the defendant was
attending the playhouse, occupying
two-bit seats and enjoying the drama,
when she was seized with that inde
finable feeling which indicates the pres
ence of an enemy. Intuitively she
knew that Mr. Fritz was near, for no
other person she knew of had desire
to do her injury, and wnen she glanced
around and saw him "lording it in a
box" and malignantly sneering as his
eyes met hers, she was more pained
than surprised. Right there and then
she determined to "have it out with
him" and when the curtain dropped
and he retired to the foyer she followed
him. Taxing him with hounding her
she slapped his cheek with an open
hand. He requested her to repeat the
assault and she promptly complied.
Then he spoiled the remainder of her
evening by giving her into custody.
Mr. Fritz averred that he had never
given the defendant any provocation
whatsoever for her attack upon him.
To which she warmly retorted by de
claring that he had written anonymous
letters intended to blacken her char :
acter. He met the charges by asserting
that he had never learned to write. She
hoped he did not have sufficient hardi
hood to say in presence of the Judge
that his sister was also afflicted with
illiteracy. Instead of saying anything
of the sort he asked her if she had not
written unsigned threats to him. She
dared him to prove it. He might not
be able to prove it, but he did not pro
pose to be lied about by her. If. he
dared to call her a liar she would have

Peter Tanner, a bartender, promised
to provide for his sick wife and infant

him and the Judge allowed him to go

Tim Mulvihill and. his wife, residing
on Chenery street, were deprived of
the custody of their two young chil

two weeks ago in company with Mrs.

ON THE SAFETY OF OVER-
EATING.
The Rule of Choosfmr the Ijesser of
Two Evils Applies to the
Way You Eat.
I want to know how a man is to
know when he has had enough.
The Pilgrim Fathers. I believe, had
a quaint saying to the effect th^t you
i-hculd always rise from the table feel-
ing as if you could eat some more.
But the Question is, how much more?
Just when to stop?
That's the point.
The rule is wrong, because it is no
rule at alL
It is inexact and unscientific.
It is likely to lead to the dangerous
habit of eating too "?*'Â».
And eating toe littleâ or digesting too
little, which amounts to- the same thing
â is the cause of nine-tenths of the dis- :
*-a?es from which humanity suffers to-
day.
What is disease?
It is simply uneven balance between
Â¦waste and repair.
Some organ lacks strength to carry
on the special work for which it was
created- ,
Where shall It find the strength It
lacks?
In drugs?
Ten thousand times, NO!
Better die than become a hopeless
drug fiend.
No; in food.
"But," you say, "I eat a plenty of
good food every day!"
True, dear friend; but you don't di-
gest it.
And food, undigested. Is mere poi-
son.
So, to make food do you good, you
must take Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets.
The great thing about Stuart's Dys-
pepsia Tablets is that their action does
not depend upon stimulative druggery.
They cannot create a habit.
They contain no ingredients to "pick
you up." "tone up your nervous sys-
tem" or furnish whip energy, by calling
â¢tit your vital reserve force.
They create new strength, force and
energy â out of your food.
If taken starving:, they will do you
no good at all.
So, eat to live and live to eat with
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets. 'Â¦Â¦';. Â¦/''Â¦
The curse of our present civilization
is exhaustion.
And exhaustion, whether of brain,
nerves, physical strength or vital force,
is caused by starvation.
Of two evila. it Is better to overeat
(ar.d prevent indigestion with Stuart's
Dyspepsia Tablets) than to rise from
the table not having eaten enough to
repair the exhaustion of your vital
forces.
For exhaustion or starvatio,n leads to
the most varied forms of sfekness or
disease, brought on by inability of the
weakened vitality to counteract the
disease â poisons and microbes
Whereas, the well-fed and well-nour-
ished person, without ever feeling the
v/orse for it, can expose himself to dan-
gers, the mere thought of which would
drive the weak, starveling dysneDtic
into a panic flL
Good food, well digested, is the great
secret of a healthful existence here on
earth-
So eat heartily, every day, of the best
food you can gret and regulate the
working of your digestive machinery
with Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets.
As a result, you will be astonished to
find how much stronxer and livelier you
feel, how much more and better work
you can do, how much more pleasure
you Tv-fll get out of life and how your
old enemy, that chronic trouble which
has fastened upon your weak spot,
wherever it is. will up arid away and
ever after leave you In peace, health
and comfort.
There's more truth than poetry In all
this. 'â¢ Â»
Try It once.'-.

SMILING SUP ASLEEP.
The digits are treated to new shades
in coverings and the wearing of white
gloves is on the wane. They are su
perseded by very pale gray and light
tans, worn with the modish elbow
sleeves, even when the costume Is white
or of some pale color.
One is rather inclined to deplore the
passing of the white glove, for In sum
mer or winter they gave such a festive
air to a. somber toilet and then femi
ninity will have no excuse for the don
ning of slightly soiled gloves. Her old
excuse in the case of the white glove
was, "Just look, my dear, at these
soiled gloves, and it's the second time
I've worn them!" This plea was lovely,
was convenient, but 'tis past.
ABOUT WHITE GLOVES.
Without inviting discusskn of this
thorny question, I may say, writes La
bouchere In London Truth, that my
own opinion is â supposing anybody
wants itâ that a husband's rights are
what he can get. My view' of a wife's
rights is the same. Whether it is wise
for either party to get all that he (or
she) can Is a question of expediency, to
be decided according to circumstances
and Individual inclination. The govern
ing principle of the situation is that
when two people ride the same horse
one must ride behind. The question,
therefore, whene-er a conflict of rights
arises, is whether the front seat is
worth fighting about and, If so, how
long and how hard.
A London paper quotes a shopgirl as
saying that the English woman can gen
erally be persuai 1 to take this or
that whether she wants It or not and
that she does not often see that she
gets value for her money. The t English
are also courteous' and considerate. It
appears that Americans, on the. other
hand, give the greatest trouble of all;
they are afraid of being cheated, they
want to make sure before they buy that
they could 'not get the same thing for
less money elsewhere and they are
never courteous. . As 6hoppers, It is
French women, however, who command
the greatest admiration, we are told.
They always know exactly what they
want and will take nothing else.
SHOPPING TRAITS.
MATRIMONIAL RIGHTS.
The long shoulders of the moment
sometimes give a lot of trouble to the
amateur dressmaker. The correct way
to fit them is to put the underpart in
first. Tack the full portion of the
sleeves into small plaits and make
them perfectly fit the size of the arm
hole. The effect is prettier If the plaits
are loosened after the bolero is fitted,
but if desired they can be left stitched
for a few inches from the armhole.
There are many devices for obtaining
the long shoulder effect without actu
ally cutting the long seam, which is
so difficult. For example, embroidery
and lace can be arranged so as to have
the points running down over the top
of the arm and this will be found very
effective.
AN Oakland paper begs to assure The Call that that city does not
desire annexation to San Francisco, and is doing quite well go
ing it alone. We are glad of this and have to advise our
neighbor to give that fact as wide publicity as possible, to counteract
the effect of the bond election. After all, the bonding propositions,
except one, received a majority of the votes cast, and that majority
is a leaven that ought to cause Oakland to rise. While we think
that the city erred in listening to appeals to prejudice and passion to
defeat the improvement bonds, we stand ready to help a recovery
from the bad effects of that act. If Oakland will learn to pull to
gether and will pull wisely, it will not lack friends willing to help.
Nothing that may be said now will change the opinion of the
friends of progress, nor reverse their conclusion that a great mis
take has been made. If the city thrive and grow and property ap
preciate in spite of the blunder, it will be evidence of great and in
herent strength, and of capacities that deserve better treatment than
sodden and sordid opposition to sewers, schools, parks and more
wharfage.
Incidentally we may remark that such a city deserves some
thing better in public buildings than a city hall that resembles the
shack of a widow whose children have run away with a circus, and
a city jail that is condemned by the Board of Health. Still we
hope that bad officials will be kept out of the city hall and good citi
zens out of the city jail, and that Oakland will some time wake up
and shake herself and put her hat on straight, and appear to the
world as the professional beauty she ought to be. The rebuke of a
friend is kind, and if we have uttered anv it is of that sort.

are always reading accounts of her
beauty and charm.

HOW TO FIT A SLEEVE
OAKLAND'S CASE.
She wasn't extravagantly dressed.
You all probably have dresses very
much on the same order.
She wore a pretty, well-fitting cloth
skirt, a dainty white wash waist and
a white straw hat with pale blue
coque plumes.
That all sounds very simple, does
it not?
The costume suited to perfection
Mrs. LÂ»adenburg*s earnest, sweet, un
affected face. Her hair was drawn
back in soft waves from her brow â
no hard, shiny or untidy pompadour
disfigured her. '{ -
Her dress, though simple, was put
on with the greatest care. There was
not one single conspicuous item about
herentire costume. . --Â¦
If you would be popular, girls, bear
in mind that nothing takes better
than simplicity, freedom from affecta
tion and neatness.
The beauty of neatness is a beauty
that no girl can afford to -despise.
Some of the present-day fashions
are not especially neat, and they hap
pen to be styles that appeal much to
the soul of woman.
But they are styles that require
to be modeled of the very best ma
terial.
There are some sweet, plump, rosy
faced women, moving down a sunny
slope just the other side of middle life,
who will rejoice exceedingly over the
new fashion for old-fashioned bonnets.
They have been yearning for the re
vival of this pretty headgear and may
now find it in various styles in exhibits
of Paris millinery.
But this year's bonnets are not
wholly for these peaceful ladies who
walk in - pleasant places. Bonnets are
in vogue: again for various occasions.
for theaters, for concerts, for visiting,
for all times when a huge picture hat
would seem out of place.

"There is nothing so pretty and
smart on a girl," said one of them,
''as a. shirt waist suit.. It/ always looks
so ship-shape and neati" â¢
Of course, you may not all care, for
shirt waist suits; this is merely men
tioned as an example and suggestion.
There are many styles that are equally
simple and neat.
5DMETHING neat and simple,
without any frills and flying
ends, but above all things,
neat."
That was the united answer
of half a dozen men to whom there
was put the question, "How do you
like to see a girl dress?" says a
writer in the Pittsburg Press.
They were all men who knew what
they were talking about, and whose
opinion was worth paying attention to.
wifl probably' stick to the fussy, elab
orate style, but If you dress to please
men you will keep to the simple, more
quiet styles.
Above all things, men admire neat
ness. No matter how handsome a
shirt waist may be. if it is soiled it
has no beauty in a man's eyes. He
would far rather see you in a.98-cent
muslin waist that was fresh and clean.
Don't forget; dear girls, that if you
are pretty it is a shame to mar your
beauty by untidiness, and if you are
plain you absolutely dare not be un
tidy.
So, you see, there is no escape. You
just must be neat.
When reproduced in poorer fab
rics they look very fine for the first
few wearings, and after that they
quickly go to pieces.
If, then, you can't afford the ex
pensive fabrics, why not be content
with the more simple fashions and not
try to imitate all the frills and puffs
and fallals that we see on so many
gowns this year?
To no one woman in ten la this

Plain, simple lines are always more
becoming than broken effects.

The men of business and the commercial organizations of this
city have been foresighted in the matter, of increasing our water
front facilities, by seawall extension. By their urgency the last
Legii-lature submitted to the voters a proposition to issue bonds for
the $2,000,000 required to extend the seawall. This is a loan to the
water front, to be repaid out of its revenues, by rentals. It does not
increase the State debt, nor impose any additional tax upon the peo
ple. The bonds are a lien on the income of the water front only. The
necessity for the issue and the need of the improvement it will make
are certified by both of the political parties of the State. Their con
ventions indorsed the proposition and called on the voters to affirm
it at the election next month. The candidates, speakers and com
mittees of the two parties should not forget the matter, but should
make its advocacy a feature in their campaign. They control the
means of publicity. They reach nearly every voter in the State, and
all citizens will be impressed by the spectacle of the two rival
parties agreeing upon a matter of the highest economic importance to
the State. Let it be made plain that every citizen has a very direct
interest in the building of the seawall.
When the Panama canal is built, the all water means of export
and import to distant markets will favorably affect every producer in
California, provided we have adequate shipping facilities here, other
wise we must lose instead of gain by the building of the canal.

cise spot it occupies on the map. Other spots, not as favorably sit
uated, arc apt to exert themselves and by art overcome the de
merits of 'location. Sixty years ago it would have been a wild
pucsscr who guessed that a city would rise on the noisome marshes
around Fort Dearborn that would eclipse Milwaukee, and become
r.ut only the great city of the lakes, but one of the great cities of the
uxirld. The task was accomplished in spite of mud and mire-
San Francisco has every advantage of situation to control the
commerce of the Pacific, but she needs amplification of facilities to
accommodate that commerce. These must be provided on the water
front, where at present the dock facilities are ancient, out of date,
inadequate and incompetent to meet the demand upon them. We are
getting, in the Pacific fleet, some of the greatest steamers in the
world. Our docks are so insufficient that these great ships can only
run a :kjsc into them, and commerce is restrained and the cost of
business increased by the difficulties of discharging and taking cargo.
The wharves, in fact, are so crowded that economical handling of
merchandise is impossible. I
It we arc to hold on to the commerce we have and get the
r.aiural increase which is in sight, we must increase the facilities of
our water front. There is only one way to do this. The seawall
must be extended to completion. This requires the making of nearly
s mile of wall, at a cost of $2,000,000. The facilities added to our
water front by this improvement will bring in a rental of $60,000
a year. It will furnish adequate berths for the largest ships, with
ample wharf room for the speedy and economical handling of car
goes. It will put San Francisco in condition to take care of the
rapidly expanding commerce of the Pacific.
The whole State is interested in this improvement. The factor
ing of the products of the State is done in San Francisco. This city
and this State have interdependent interests, which must flourish
or must fade together. One cannot wane and the other wax. They
must rise or fall together. The retention of commerce by a seaport
lhat has rivals requires a ceaseless watchfulness. In trade nothing
happens. The world of commerce is not a chance world. Its de-

Young seems to have been pursued
by misfortune of late. He is the man
who accidentally set fire to the New
hall residence a few months ago and
was subsequently injured by a fall. The
blower that spurted the blazing gaso
line over him is the same sort of In
strument that exploded among a
crowd of children on Wednesday.
Young has a wife and a small baby.
The man was taken to the Central
Emergency Hospital, where he was
treated by Dr. Goodale and later trans
ferred to Simon's Sanitarium. He was
fearfully burned about the body and
his recovery is regarded as almost im
possible.
With his clothing ablaze Charles
Young, a painter, rushed madly along
Grove street, near Fillmore, yesterday
afternoon shrieking In agony. A
gasoline blower had exploded near
him while he was working on the
house. of Dr. Leo Rodgers at 817
Grove street- The fiery stuff scattered
over his clothing and burned him se
verely.
While -the frenzied man rushed down
the street crying for help several wom
en rendered him assistance. Mrs. J.
Currier, an aged woman of the neigh
borhood, was the first to reach the
man. She tried to put out the blaz
ing gasoline, but her skirts caught fire
and she herself was painfully burned.
With the fire still torturing him
Young continued his wild rush. Miss
Dorothy Wood, who lives at 819 Grove
street, was standing in her doorway.
She rushed to the rescue. She wrapped
the man in a doormat and It partly
extinguished the flames.
Mrs. Charles Fay and Miss Fay. who
live at 834 Grove street, heard the
â¢shrieks of the suffering man and with
great presence of mind seized blankets
and hurried into the street. They fin
ished the relief attempted by Misa
Wood.
The Macdonough estate, it appears,
has long wanted to have its two the
ater properties under one management.
Hall, who has had wide experience in
the field of amusements, has been tak
ing care of the Macdonough Theater
in Oakland and the story is that he
has desired for some time to become
the controller of the San Francisco
house owned by the Macdonoughs.
The expiration of the Ackerman lease
i.- approaching and Hall was told that
the estate had decided to let him have
both the Oakland and the local theater
if he wished to undertake the responsi
bility of running them. He said he was
ready to handle the California and had
outlined a plan for making it a popu
lar place of amusement- The Acker
man Interests reported that they were
ready to surrender and Hall has been
notified that he can sign the papers
and have the lease for five years.
Hence the one-act play without a plot
that is on the bills for a very near
date.
Charles Hall has acquired an option
on the lease of the California and all
h? has to do to become manager of the
playhouse on Bush street is to sign
his name to the final papers with that
of the representative of the Macdon
ough estate. Manager E. Ackerman,
who now has control or the house and
Is enjoying a successful run of "The
Tenderfoot," will step down and out
and Hall will step in.
There has been no fault found with
Ackerman's management of the prop
erty and, as he says, he is simply al
lowing his lease to run out and does
not care to renew it under the circum
stances.
Before many months have passed
there will be a shifting of scenes at the
California Theater. The play will be
In one act with a notary public and
two others as principals. There will be
nothing dramatic in the situation; no,
not even anything farcical. There will
be no suggestion of a comic opera or
the hurly-burly of a Fischer's.
Bertha Ebert is the correct name of
the girl. She is 22 years old and left
home about three years ago and held
a position as stenographer and book
keeper in Philadelphia until last July.
when she came to San Francisco as
assistant manager of the Occl-Orient
Medicine Company, of /Which Dr. Hoyle
is manager-
Sunday her sister, Sophie, of Bay
City received a letter from her saying
that she had quit the company. From
the tone of the letter Sophie thought
her sister was despondent, and, while
Bertha said she might return to Bay
City, Sophie feared she contemplated
suicide and on Tuesday sent a telegram
telling her to spare her life.
The sister in Bay City has received
no word of Bertha's disappearance
other than newspaper dispatches, and
thinks it possible that Bertha is on
her way home. She says there was
no love affair to her knowledge be
tween her sister and Dr. Hoyle, but
declines to shed any light on the trou
ble, which she admits existed.' The
girl's parents live in Bay City. Bertha
left home three years ago and her
father had heard nothing from her
since she left home until apprised of
her probable death.
Although parents and daughter were
estranged for several years, says a dis
patch received from Bay City last
night, the old man broke down com
pletely while talking of the affair.
The mystery which enshrouds the
disappearance of Miss Bertha Ebert oh
October 4 grows apace each day. That
the body of the young woman is now
floating on the white-capped waves,
perhaps miles from shore, is the theory
of the police and others. Yesterday
two telegrams from the girl's sister in
Bay City, Michigan, were discovered.
From their tone it is probable that
Mies Ebert had a disagreement with a
certain Dr. Hoyle. This may have
prompted her to self destruction.
On October 5 Miss Ebert'a hat and
purse were found on the beach near
Fort Mason by Corporal James Parker
of the Thirteenth Infantry. She was
last seen at her lodgings in the Earl
CHffe, 1201 Gough street, on the even
ing of October 3. Her movements from
that time cannot be traced, but it is
supposed that she wandered out near
Fort Maso-n some time on Tuesday,
October 4, and cast herself into the bil
lowy deep.
Miss Ebert came to this city about
three months ago and sought assistance
from the Y. W. C. A. She said she
came from Australia. She was direct
ed to apartments, but left them later
and went to live at the Earl CUffe. Ac
cording to a dispatch from her native
town, the girl came to this city to work
for a medical concern under the direc
tion of Dr. Hoyle. She left his em
ployment later and it was probably
due to a scene with the medical man. â¢
MIes Eberfs relatives say there is
not a love affair or like trouble in the
girl's life, but a telegram sent by her
sister, which was never received by the
missing girl, suggests that the latter
was tangled up in some manner with
Dr. Hoyle. The sister begs Bertha to
forget him and spare her life. Fallow-
Ing is a copy of the telegram and one
sent the missing girl by the "Western
Union Company requesting her to an
swer it:
BAT CITT. Mich.â B*sÂ»lÂ» W. Efcert. Earl
Clifte, 1201 Goush: Save life for n^ cake.
Forget Dr. Hoyle. (Signed) SOPHIE EBERT.
The dispatch from the Western Union
reads as follows:
Please give quick answer or reason why net
ours date from Bay City, Mich., to you.

Miss Nettie Blackmore, Minneapolis,
tells how any young woman may be per-
manently cured of monthly pains by taking
Lydia EL Pinkham's Vegetable Compound!
" Young Women: â I had frequent headaches of a severe nature,
dark spots before my eyes, and at my menstrual periods I suffered
untold agony. A member of the lodge advised me to try Lydia E.
Pinkliam's Vegetable Compound, but I only scorned good advice and
felt tliat my case "wns hopeless, but she kept at me until I bought a
bottle and started taking it. I soon had the best reason in the -world to
change my opinion of the medicine, as each day my health improved, and
finally I was ent ire ly without pain at mv menstruation periods. I am most
grate'ful/' â Nettie Blackmore, 23 Central Ave., Minneapolis, Minn.
Painful Periods -^
are quickly and permanently overcome by Lydia E. Pinkham's
Vegetable Compound. The above letter Is only one of hundreds of
thousands vrhich prove this statement to be a fact. Menstruation
is a severe strain on a woman's vitality, â If it is painful something:
is wron*r. Don't take narcotics to deaden the pain, but remove
the cause â perhaps it is caused by irregularity or womb displace-
ments, or the development of a tumor. "Whatever it is, Lydia
E. Pinkham's Vegetable Compound is guaranteed to.cure it.
If there is anything about your case about which yon would like special
advice, write freely to Mrs. Pinkham. She will treat your letter as strictly
confidential. She can surely help you, for no person in America can ppeak
f ma a wider experience in treating female ills. She has helped hundreds of
thousands of women bacV to health. Her address is Lynn, Mass., and her
&drice is free. You are very foolish if you do not accept her kind invitation.

Excellent Programme Is Provided for
Entertainment Of the Members
and Their Guests.
The Olympic Club gave a "ladies'
night" last evening and the big gym
nasium of the club was filled wltb^
members and their friends. The pro
gramme, which was arranged by John
A. Hammersmith in the absence of
Leader* John J. Gleason, proved one
of the most interesting the club has
ever held. Captain Rosenfeld was also
instrumental in making the evening's
entertainment a success.
Of the athletic programme there
were so many good things that men
tion of each must be made. First
came fancy pyramids by members of
the Eintracht Turn Verein. They were
followed by George Schlitter and Baby
Cornell on the rings and by catch-as
catch-can wrestling by members of
the club. The Nelson family gave
some fancy ground and lofty tum
bling, and the work of the Olympic
representatives on the parallel bars
was good. Japanese wrestling, or jiu
jitsu, caught the fancy of the specta
tors and many of the trick holds were
appreciated. Indian club swinging by
ladles of the Eintracht Turn Verein
and fencing with foils and sabers
came next. The Chinese pupils of In
structor George S. Miehling went
through some fine dumbbell calisthen
ics. Exercises on the "gym horse," !
bag punching, sparring and swimming
exhibitions ended the evening's en
tertainment.
During the course of the pro
gramme President William Greer
Harrison presented medals to ' three
Olympic men who were representa
tives of the club at St. Louis. They
were Francis Galley, J. Scott Leary
and George V. Finnegan. Sam Berger
was also a prize winner at the fair,
but received his medal before leaving

STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Oct. 13.â
K. L. Fenton, the quarterback, was
elected captain to-night of the Stanford
freshman football team, which plays
the eleventh annual intercollegiate
game on Saturday with the 1908 eleven
from the University of California. Fen
toh's only competitor for the honor was
Cadwalader, left halfback, who comes
from Pomona. Fenton comes from
Portland. Or., where he was quarter
back and half on the strong Multnomah
Club team of that city. Gritty and full
of fight, Fenton has a good head on
his shoulders and will be capable of
running his team to the best advan
tage. He will act as field captain also,
giving the signals.
Assistant Coach C. D. Hauverman
announced the names of the freshmen
who will play against the University
of California at Berkeley Saturday aft
ernoon. The men and their positions
are as follows:
Left end. H. S. Wilson, from Harvard

The freshmen have been resting since
they defeated the second eleven Tues
day and signal work has been
the order of the practice. It is Coach
Hauverman's intention to send a team
on the field that is perfect in team
work and trust the rest to the strength
of the individual players. The men will
go to Berkeley on Saturday morning,
accompanied by a large delegation of,
Stanford rooters. '
The final rally and send-off to the
freshman team was held In the chapel
last night. Five hundred of the car
dinal's best rooters indulged in an hour
of prolonged yelling and singing. Pro
fessor C. Searles, Rev. D. C. Gardner
and C. C. Seeley, left guard for Stan
ford in 1900 and now a member of the
visiting Multnomah team, were the
speakers of the evening.

After the Seals and the Commuters
had \*ainly striven for ten rounds to
entice the winning run over the pan
at Recreation Park yesterday the
shades of night began softly to de
Â¦cend on the Eighth-street lot, and the
two teams were forced to mak'e a get
away without deciding whose game it
vu. Oakland had it all ready to be
delivered In the last two rounds, but
cculd not make good. Score: 2 to 2.
No one will deny that the struggle
was as sensational and as erratic as
was ever pulled off at Recreation Park.
Fancy the Oakland team getting only
one hit and still being on the board
with a pair of tallies. But that one
â¢was called a homer by the umpire, and
it happened in the third round, when
the most dangerous of all the league
sluggers, Oscar Graham, smote the
leather out to deep center. The ques
tion as to whether the ball went over
the fence or not was raised, and the
umpire said it did. so that was all.
Corbett was wild, but he pitched ele
gant ball at that. Outside of that third
inniug nothing that looked like a hit
â¢was secured by the Oakland batsmen.
Joe received perfect support till the
ninth inning, after two were out. Then
Gorton executed a wild throw and the
run that tied it up was ushered In.
Two were fanned in the third when
Graham approached the plate and sent
the first ball pitched on a cruise out to
deep center. It hit either the house or
the fence and then bounded back. Um
pire McCarthy thought it was over the
fence and declared the hit a home run.
Of course the Seals did not agree with
the Indicator man and an awful row
followed, which lasted for several min
utes.
The Seals could not break in with a
run till the seventh. Graham had man
aged to get rid of two men, when he
forthwith passed Anderson and Goch
nauer. Gorton bit off a double that went
straight to the left field fence and An
derson galloped home. Brother Joe
Kent Gochnauer in from third with a
long fiy to Kruger, putting the Seals
one to the good.
It looked good for them, for the Oak
landers could not hit. Dunleavy opened
up the ninth with a dinky one to Cor
bett. Van Buren failed to get the throw
and Dun was safe. He lost no time in
tearing down to second and landed on
third when Schlafley bunted. Then
Kruger laid down a good one to An
derson. The Swede kid gobbled it up
and threw to the pan perfectly, catch
ing Dun by a foot. Kruger stole sec
ond and started for third, when Gor
ton threw the ball away to left field.
Kruger ambled in and it was a dead
lock.
The Seals could not get a man on the
tacks in their half of the ninth. Dev
reaux, for the Commuters, drew a
pass. He immediately went down
after Stark had fouled to Van Buren.
Gorton tried to catch "Brick" stealing
and made another bad throw, sending
the "Red" one to third. Graham was
also passed and he, too, partook of a
tteal. Canley was called out on strikes
and Francks ended the struggle with
a fly to Waldron. The score:

THREE STRAIGHT FOR TACOMA.
BERKELEY, Oct. 13. â There was
a mutiny among the men of the fresh
man football team this afte'rnoon
when Graduate Manager Ezra Decoto
walked on the field and said:
"I have to announce that there will
be no complimentary tickets for the
team members to the game on Satur
day. Captain Allen alone get a
complimentary-"
Nothing was said for a few mo
ments, but Coach Hopper finally
broke the silence. He walked up to
Decoto and said: t
"How much are the tickets, Mr.
Decoto? I will buy them myself for
the men. They've worked hard enough
to be entitled to them and they de
serve them."
Instantly protest was made by the
players against the acceptance of
Coach Hopper's offer. The men
crowded about him, declaring that jf
tickets had to be bought each man
would buv his own.
Manager Deco^o stood aside while
the men discussed the matter. Fin
ally he receded from his original
stand and announced that eighteen
men would be given two tickets and
ten men one ticket each and that ul
timatum settled the affair. It became
a closed incident â on the football
field. Elsewhere on the campus
tongues buzzed and gossips rolled the
story of the mutiny as a sweet morsel
under their tongues.
One week ago Coach Hopper and
Manager Decoto clashed on the ques
tion of applying sawdust to the field.
Hopper insisted that sawdust must be
used. Decoto said it would cost too
much. Hopper said players were be
ing injured by the roughness of the
ground. Decoto said men could be
spared this year as well as any other.
This argument created a stir which
had died down only to be revived by
the fracas to-night over the football
tickets.
Jimmy Britt made a quiet Journey to
the bank yesterday and took out $2500,
which he placed in the hands of Harry
Corbett, the official stakeholder for the
Gans-Britt fight. This coin is the for
feit James threatened to post a few
days ago to bind his coming match
with Joe Gans. Now that it is up no
one will worry on that score, and an
other stone is also laid to pave the way
for the battle.
No permit was issued yesterday aft
ernoon by the Board of Supervisors,
for the reason that the Police Commit
tee did not meet, as was expected. They
have postponed their meeting until this
afternoon, when the matter will prob
ably be settled one way or another.
Just what is going to happen still re
mains to be seen. Manager Coffroth is
as confident as ever, and the fact that
his 51000 forfeit is in the hands of Harry
Corbett would indicate that he has
some kind of a line which promises
much. The Shasta Club people and all
others interested in_the mill were san
guine of the outcome last night and
said that there would be no trouble
about the permit.
If the permit Is not issued the Shasta
Club promoters may attempt to hold
the fight at all hazards. They would
be successful If the police did not inter
fere. Should the latter body decline to
mix with the club officials the Super
visors would be powerless to prevent
the bout and it would then take place
without their sanction. This is only idle
rumor, but such a thing is possible and
strange incidents happen every day,
especially in the prizefight business.
However, the whole thing will probably
be settled for once and all when the
Police Committee of the Supervisors
get together this afternoon and take
definite action.
Manager Willie Britt announced last
night that James would leave his coun
try seat at San Mateo to-morrow and
take to the Seal Rock House to begin
his task of getting into condition. Willie
is afraid Jimmy will go stale if he does
too much' work, and therefore the
champ will not overwork himself. He
has been doing some light training at
San Mateo and can round into form at
short notice.
MORRIS PARK, Oct. 13.â General
regret is being expressed on. all Bides
at the fact that weather and track
conditions are unfavorable for the
complete success of the closing week
of the Morris Park meeting. Horses
are beating others which are vastly
their superiors under normal condi
tions. The heavy track has played 1
havoc with form in some cases. Still,
old turfmen declare that but for Just
such happenings the turf would lose
much of its attractions. The uncer
tainties of the game help some as
much as they hurt others.
Lady Henrietta opened at 100 to 1
and closing at '20 to 1, ran away with
the third race. . For the Ramapo
handicap, the chief race of the day.
Dolly Spanker, with 120 pounds, was
top weight. He was not fancied by
his people, and went to 7 to 1. He
was last all the way. "He never saw
the day he could go nine furlongs and
concede twenty pounds to Wotan, as
that colt is now," was the remark of
one close to the Dolly Spanker stable.
Wotan made all the running for sev
en furlongs, when Woodford Clay's
Outcome made her bid and won v clev
erly. Mineola was. second all the way
and Ormonde's Right third, a head in
front of Ostrich, which got away last.

SMITH SAVES THE GAME.
Seattle Man's Perfect Throw to Plate
Completes Double Play.
SEATTLE. Oct. 13. â Seattle won
from Los Angeles to-day in a strug
gle that was decidedly strenuous. Af
ter getting a good lead Seattle was
relegated to the rear by an attack on
Pitcher Jay Hughes that was wonder
ful to behold. Los Angeles simply
clouted the ball all- over the field,
shooting six runs across the plate.
From that time on until the seventh
Seattle did not have a word to say.
Three consecutive singles off Hall
gave two runs. Flood then put In
Newton. One more hit and Seattle
got the third run, which gave her the
lead again.
Hickey finished the game for Seat
tle and in every inning tied* himself
up but managed to work out without
a scratch, Carlos Smith's throw to

ROME, Oct. 13. â At the next con
sistory, which is to be held Novembej
14, it is not likely that any American
Cardinal will be elected on account of
the conflicting claims of Americarrist
and anti-Americanist prelates. Evi
dently the Pope's opinion of "Ameri
canism" differs from that of his pred
ecessor. After Cardinal Satolli's
American tour it was asserted that no
Cardinal of any nation would be
elected.

: HONOLULU,- Oct. 7.-^-WlIliam Fran
cis Love, a well-known citizen of
Honolulu, committed suicide at about
7 o'clocjc on the morning, of October
5. Love was the secretary and a large
shareholders in the Manufacturers'
Shoe Company of this city. On the
previous afternoon he gave the key of
the shoe store to B. Samraons, the
bookkeeper, and instructed him to
open the store in the morning, re
marking that W. H. Smith, the man
ager, would return from the coast on
the -Sonoma. He then bought a re
volver and a box of cartridges, saying
that they were for a friend but hav
ing them charged in his own name.
He was restless through the night and
in the morning put the revolver to his
breast, shooting himself through the
heart.
Love was born in California on. the
14th of July, 1864. He came to the
islands early in life and has spent
most of his time here.

WTTH BULIiET IX BREAST
WASHINGTON, Oct 13.â That the
canteen is of great moral benefit to the
army Is the claim made by Brigadier
General G. H. Burton in his annual re
port as inspector general of the army,
to the Secretary of War, made public
to-day.
- "It seems to be almost; the unanimous
sentiment of the army," he says, "that
the one thing lacking to meet tha
soldiers' wants and tastes Is the can
teen feature. . The absence of this leads
to sickness, the commission of military
offenses, desertion and other crimes,
as well as impaired discipline, by
driving men to resort to the low
dives and groggeries that have sprung
up like mushrooms around mili
tary reservations since the prohibition
law was enacted. In fact, the canteen
feature Is not only a benefit morally,
but the profits' derived from the sales
of beer and light wines are used to im
prove the mess, as well as for the pur
chase of periodicals, publications, etc.,
all of which add to the soldiers' com
fort and contentment."
General Burton then quotes the In
spector general of the Philippine di
vision as saying regarding the can
teen:
"Its absence is seriously felt. The ef
fect, especially in the provinces, is to
encourage men in the, use of the va
rious native drinks, in some instances
of opium." ~/*- Â¦'Â¦
ST. LOUIS, Oct. 13.â The most im
portant action of to-day's session of
the annual convention of the Associa
tion of Military and Naval Surgeons of
the United States .was the unanimous
adoption of a resolution, recommend
ing that "the sale of beer be permitted
at the army post exchanges, subject to
such regulations as shall be determined
by the general Btaff and tha Secretary
of War."
A resolution was also adopted peti
tioning Congress to reorganize the med
ical departments of the army and navy,
and to give to the medical officers the
dignity and power enjoyed by officers
of rank in the "respective
branches of the service.

The Marblc-Iu-ad will Join the New York 'at
Magdalena Bay. and shortly that battleship
will sail for the Atlantic. She will meet. the
protected cruiser Chicago at Sand Point, near
the Straits of Magellan, where the admiral's
flag will be transferred.
On<? of the ship arrivals yesterday was thÂ«
United States gunboat Bennington, Commander
Kossuth Xilts commanding, from Magdalena
Bay. . This vessel, with the battleship New
York and cruiser Boston, has been engaged in
a great gun target practice, and in the 8-inch'
rifle work the New York's crew beat, their
former fine records. They now have to their
credit four shots with four center hits made in
"Uhty-eeven seconds. ! The shooting of the
other ships was fully up to the mark, showing
that the naval men behind the gun can drop
shells where they will do. the most harm. Â¦

ROME, Oct. 13. â Pope Pius, alarm
ed at the spread of socialism In Italy,
which is menacing the throne and
church alike, no longer insists on the
abstention of Catholics from voting at
the coming election. Bishops have
been secretly instructed to support tha
Government in constituencies favor
able to the socialistic candidates."
â¢ ' It is reported that the new papal
policy was suggested after an inter
view between Von Bulow and Premier
Giolitti by the Kaiser, who is anxious
to diminish the tension between the
Vatican and Quirinal in order to se
cure c,ordial relations between the
Pope and the triple alliance, a state
of affairs which Cardinal Rampolla,
former secretary of state, opposed.
Bishops Are Secretly Instructed to
Support Candidates of the Con
servative Element.

EDINBURGH, Oct. 13.â The Duke of
Connaught, brother of King Edward,
while driving: in a motor car from Edin
burgh to GosfordHouse, the seat of the
Carl of Weymes,* had a narow escape
from death and suffered painful in
juries, from which he was for a time
unconscious. The automobile in which
the Duke was riding with his aid-de
camp, Major Murray, . in paesing a
street car collided with a cart. The
overhanging portion of the cart struck
the rear seat of the automobile and lit
erally carried away that section of the
vehicle.- Th'e Duke was thrown out
with great force.' As soon as the auto
mobile'could be stopped Major Murray
went to the aid of the* Duke, whom he
found unconscious and bleeding from
wounds about the head.
A second automobile carrying mem
bers of the Duke's suite came up, and
the Duke was taken back to Edinburgh
in it. By the time the automobile
reached Edinburgh the Duke had re
covered and was able to walk into his
hotel. After two stitches were taken in
his ear and his hurts had been exam
ined by physicians it was announced
that the Duke would suffer no serious
consequences, but had received a severe
shaking up and shock. Major Murray
was not hurt.

The passenger department of the
Southern Pacific Company Is institut
ing a search for James McCabe. as
sistant to H. R. Judah, assistant gen
eral passenger agent. McCabe's
mysterious disappearance has caused
considerable anxiety among his rela
tives and the officials of the railroad
corporation.
McCabe, who is a man of regular
habits and .who is highly regarded by
his employes and office associates, has
been ill for some time as a result of
overwork. Of late he had been com
plaining of a failing memory, and
several times he had been found
asleep at his desk. He finally yielded
to the advice of his superiors to take
a rest, and on October 8 he quit work
and went to his hdme at 1945 Ban
croft way, Berkeley.
On Monday last he felt much better
and announced his intention of com
ing over to this side of the bay, add
ing that he might visit the Southern
Pacific Company's offices. /That is the
last his family has^seen of him. His
mother fears he has met with some
accident or foul play, and yesterday
she sent one of her sons over to this
city to notify the railroad officials of
McCabe's disappearance. The missing
man is 44 years old, a widower, and
lived with his daughter, mother and
brother. He is well known in local
railroad circles and was formerly em
ployed in the auditing department of
the Southern Pacific Company.

The latter, however, learned of the
plan to take him off the vessel and
succeeded in eluding the officers by
stowing himself away until the China
had proceeded on her course.
Arriving here yesterday and appar
ently fearing that he might be sub
jected to further notoriety, Pearson
secured the services of a tug, which
conveyed himself and wife ashore in
advance of the other passengers. On
reaching the wharf the couple were
driven immediately to the St. Francis
Hotel, where they^ locked themselves
in their rooms and sent word to the
office that they would not receive
any one. During the evening in re
sponse to a call from newspaper rep
resentatives Mrs. Pearson said her
husband had retired for the night and
would not see any callers.
Henry H. Pearson, formerly of thi3
city, but later a resident of Salt Lake,
where he figured as the principal in
a sensational murder trial in 18S7,
was among- the passengers who arrived
from the Orient yesterday on the
steamship China. Pearson was accom
panied by\his wife, and their presence
on the steamer would probably have
not attracted more than ordinary in
terest but for an exciting incident at
Honolulu, which revealed to his fellow
passengers the story of his trial in Salt
Lake, and for the balance of the voy
age made himself and wife the sub
jects of much gossip aboard the vessel.
In 1886 Pearson, then a young man,
was arrested by the Utah authorities
and charged with the murder of a
woman. His father, one ot the best
known hotel men in this country, se
cured the services of Attorney Henry
Highton of this city to defend his son,
who was finally acquitted.
Highton, it is alleged, charged a fee
of $15,000 for his services, but succeeded
in getting only $1000 of that sum from
the Pearsons. Later young Pearson
went to the Orient to live and some
months* ago Henry Highton changed
his residence to Honolulu, where he re
cently learned of Pearson's contem
plated return to the United States.
When the China arrived at Honolulu
Highton was on hand with two Terri
torial officers with authority to arrest
Pearson.

EL PASO, Oct. 13. â The flood wa
ters In the Rio Grande are hourly
getting higher and at Mesilla Park,
N. M., forty miles from here, it is the
highest in twenty years and is two
miles wide on the public road above
there. Several homes have been de
stroyed along the river banks. Berlno,
fifteen miles up the river, reports the
situation improved below there, but
when the present head of water
reaches there it is thought that condi
tions will be worse than ever. The
high water has washed out the head
of the irrigation ditch there and much
other damage . has been done j to
ditches and irrigated fields.

â¢COTTONâ The market is now practically
lack again to the 10 cent basis and I think
it will meet with a better class of buying and
more resistance to any further bearish pres
sure from this level, and we would favor
purchases of late winter or spring months for
moderate turns, especially In the event of any
further decline. The movement of the croo
for the week will be lighter than last week
Â«nd splnnere and exporters will buy more free
ly on any further concessions and it must
also be remembered that the crop could be
fcaflly damaged and the prospective yield ma
terially reduced in the event of cold wet
meather setting in. as it is all open from ton
to bottom of the plants. Price Is now flood

Prospects for Another Good Year
Deemed Flattering.
ThÂ« New Tork circular of Henry Clews
Bays:
â¢'The week ha* bÂ«*a fruitful in favorable
A number of very satisfac
tory railroad report* vert forthcoming, some
ef which Â«howed gratifying gains in gross
'carnlsjrs, others Important reductions In
eper&tina; expenses, while others have Joined
or promised to Join the ranks of dividend
p&j-enT All of these disclosures prove that
the railroad, as a whole, are enjoying- con
tinued prosperity. Nor 1Â» tnls all. Traffic
managers appear very confident In a continu
ance of this prosperity for another season, and
It ir.ust be conceded that euch views are well
supported. All doubt about the crops is now
at an end, and this removes a very important
restraint upoa bullish enthusiasm. We are
f.nally assured cf an abundance of corn, and
this, even If the expected 2,500,000,000 crop is
not culte realized. Is one of our most lm
port&nt sources cf rational prosperity. We are
sure. also, of a h',g cotton crop, some eeti
matÂ«e now reaching 12,000.000, and while early
frost mlffbt cut off lOu.000 to 200,000 bales, it
could not do serious Injury. Evea the wheat
crop is threshing out better than the crop
kiUcrs were willing to let us bellrve, and in
<on?e<juence of these developments the price."
of corn, cotton and wheat are receding from
the exseselve high prices which they not long
..;-Â¦' commanded. It is now demonstrated be
yond a doubt that American farmers â East,
Wes=t and South â are to enjoy another pros1>er-
DU ye&r. which is the all important fact in
the business situation.
MONEY SUPPLIES INCREASING.
â¢"One of the main- sources of buoyancy is
the increasing supplies of money. Several
millions of eold are now on the way from
Australia to be added to our already plethoric
stock of gold, the inflationary effect of which
upon values M not yet fully appreciated. Our
i -irculation increased over $3,S00,OOO In Sep
tember, and is now more than $150,000,000 In
? xeess of October 1 last year. This redund
ancy of money and its effect upon Interest
rates is unquestionably one of the most pow
t-rful elements in the present bull movement.
â¢Â¦Among the satisfactory features of the
weok was continued improvement In the iron
trade. A grood many orders have recently
l-f-^n placed for iron and steel, "so that a par
tial cessation of demand may follow . during
:he remainder of the year, yet the revival of
oosfldence. trade and enterprise which is gen
erally observed promises a continued demand
during lÂ»05. ThÂ« turn in iron and steel bears
the stamp of permanence. The revival of en
terprise Is also etrlkingly shown in the re
oord of new corporations, aggregating $66,000,
<Â«Â«> in September, compared with $32,000,000 in
August, which was the low record month.
Failures aie on the decline and business Is
suffering no Interruption whatever from the
flection, which is somewhat unusual. Strikes
are on the wane. Everything points to a
widespread and moderate recovery in both
tradf and industry. There is no material
tor a boom, ar.d large expectations are sure
to be d:saÂ»pointed. As is always the case
Wall street has discounted this improvement
in advance, because the captains of industry
*.n<i finance are naturally the first to observe
the change in fundamental conditions."

to $1 11!4. During the latter. part of the ses

.heavy sales of May by a leader of the bull
element while the market was , beariahiy af
fected by a Cincinnati-journal-claiming a sur
plus of 100,000,000 bushels of wheat for export
from the Unlted^States . and Canada. Another
factor was a private cablegram from Liver
pool reporting Argentine wheat prospects very
favorable. Before the decline was checked
May had dropped to $1 09%. December 6old
off in sympathy to $1 ,09%. A fair demand
from shorts caused some recovery, t but the
market closed easy, with December at $1 10%.
Final quotations oh May were at $1 10!4#
A firm tone prevailed in the corn market
during the early part of the session. Decem
ber closed at 48%c.

COEBAL TO BE HONORED
Mrs. Moss has large holdings In Ala
meda County, owning many acres
along the San Leandro road, improved
real estate in Oakland and considerable
income property in San Francisco.
For several years Mrs. M^ss had not
mingled In society affairs, because of a
distressing experience when one of her
most ardent devotees ended his own
life in her presence because she had
declined to receive his attentions. For
some time Mrs. Mess has been quietly
residing in apartments in the Playter
block.
The bridegroom prospective has a
wide reputation in manufacturing cir
cles as an inventor and patentee. His
family descends from one of the oldest
colonial Dutch settlers in Pennsyl
vania.
Even after the marriage the Moss
children did not relent. They waited
until .after their father's death and
then attaelied his will, which had made
liberal provision for the surviving wife.
There was contest enough over the es
tate, but the young widow sustained
her ground and was allowed to take
her inheritance.
The weddiny -will take place Satur
day in San Francisco, where, aftef a
short wedding trip, the couple will
make their home.
Ten years ago Mrs. Moss, then as
now a striking beauty, wedded aged
Franklin Moss. The rich old man died
two years after the marriage. Children
of Moss by a former marriage opposed
their father's union.
Mrs. Mary Josephine Moss, the beau
tiful widow of the late Franklin Moss,
one of Alameda County's wealthy capi
talists and landholders, who has fig
ured Jn a romantic story of wifohood
and widowhood, has become the affi
anced of Harry Luokenbach, a mem
ber of the firm of L.uckenbach & Co.,
manufacturers of San -Francisco, and
scion of the Luckenbach family of
Philadelphia. This name Is identified
with the heavy shipping interests of

SUPREME JUDGE
TO BE DEPORTED
Privilege of Crossing the
United States Is Denied
to Hon. Amadee Horville
Judge Coffey is going to decide wheth
er or not two. documents purporting to
be the wills of Mary Rooney were writ
ten by her, as several witnesses testify,
or forged, as contended by "Bridget
Spafford, sister of the deceased, who is
contesting their admission to probate.
The trial of the contest has occupied
two days of Judge Coffey's time and
was concluded yesterday, when the
Judge announced that it was difficult
for. him to conclude that both papers
were written tby the same hand. He
took the matter under advisement and
will analyze the writings. The discrep
ancies in the documents are apparent
even on cursory examination. There are
interlineations in which the- characters
are not the same as those in the body
of the> alleged will, and "Rooney" is
spelled two ways and once with a small
r. The word "one" i is also spelled
"wan" in an interlineation, and there
are evidences of tracing.
In his argument AttorneyW. M. Can
non, representing Mrs. Spafford, de
clared that the second of the papers,
the one disposing of Mary Rooney's
$2000, was a rank forgery. ,He also in
timated that some of the letters in this
document and its signature are very
similar to the writing. of Mary Ryan,
principal beneficiary and applicant for
its admission to probate.
Mary Rooney was a house servant
and worked for twenty-two years in
one family. Out of her savings she
bought property in Oakland, which she
sold for $2650. Of this sum she had $2000
in a bureau, drawer when she died on
January 27. The wills, one of which
only provided for her burial, were both
dated October 8, 1903, some time after
she had left the hospital suffering from
partial paralysis. To Mary Ryan, in
whose house she lived, she left $400; to
Katherine Conroy. Elizabeth Bradley
and Mary Conroy was given each $10.0,
and there were various provisions for
her 'f unyal expenses, masses and small
bequests to clergymen. Her sister, Mrs.
Spafford, was cut off with $1. Mrs.
Ryan, Mrs. Conroy and Mrs. Bradley
were witnesses to the signing of the
wills, and testified that they all signed
at the same time, notwithstanding the
evident 1 difference in the color of the
ink and heaviness of the pen used.
It appeared from the evidence of these
beneficiaries that Mrs. Rooney had a
great aversion for her sister and would
not see her during her illness. She even
instructed . Mrs. Ryan, it is said, to
chop up her trunk and keep the sister
from getting it.
On the stand Mrs. Spafford declared
that she had. had no quarrel with her
sister, but that Mrs. Ryan and Mrs.
Conroy kept them from meeting and in
spired Mary Rooney's feeling of hatred.

I James Rea Was Fishing In Alaska
When Wife Got Judgment
Against Him â Divorce Matters.
James Rea thinks that his former
wife, Lena, or her attorney, played
him a mean trick, and upon his rep
resentations Judge Troutt â¢ has de
cided to investigate.* Mrs. Rea sued
for divorce last January and got a de
cree on February 24 for $25 a month
alimony and # $50 counsel ; fees. On
September 8 an execution was levied
against Rea on the Judgment and he
did not know of it until October 12,
when he returned from a fishing trip
to Alaska. He â¢ says that when she
filed her suit he went to her attor
'ney and told him the action would be
defended. The attorney, he says, told
him that if he would offer no opposi
tion to the suit the plaintiff would
waive alL claim to alimony, fees' and
costs. On that account he made no
answer. Now he wants the judgment
modified.
A writ of habeas corpus was ap
plied for yesterday by Swan Ander

Cure Permanent
"My baby was about six weeks old
xvhen the top of her head became cov- I
ered with thick scales, which would
peel and come off, taking the hair with
it. It would foou form again and be as
bad as before. I tried several things
and- then went to the doctor. He said
it was Eczema and prescribed an oint-
ment, which did not do any good. A
friend spoke of Cuticura Soap. I tried
it and read on the wrapper about Cuti-
cura Ointment as a remedy for Eczema.
I bought a box and washed her head in
warm water and Cuticara â¢ Soap and
gently combed the scales off. They did
not come back and her hair grew out
fine and thick. Sh^ is now a year and
a half old and has no trace of Eczema "
MRS. C. W. BURGES. Iranistan
