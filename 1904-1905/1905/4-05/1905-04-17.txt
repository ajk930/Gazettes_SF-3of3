BOLD THIEF MAKES HAUL
OF RARE JEWELS.
Mrs. Robert Tibbitts Is the Unlucky Victim
A daylight diamond robbery, occur- J
ring in the heart of the Western Ad- |
dition. is reported. A princely, col
lection of gems and jewels belonging
to Mrs. Robert Tibbitts, a well-known
society woman, residing at 563 St'einer
ptreet, was mysteriously' stolen yester
day morning between 10 o'clock and
noon during her absence from home. i
The plunder taken by the thieves ex
ceeds the value of $5000 and "consists'
of one of the finest and most valuable
collections of precious stones : in the
cit >'- . - iÂ« Â,. '..--â¢ v
The detectives have arrested two
Chinamen on suspicion, t but no -evi
dence of a tangible nature has devel- j
cped. The criminals did not \ disturb j
eny of the valuable plate in the house j
end in their haste overlooked- a .coral
necklace valued at $1500. . ; , .
Shortly after 10 o'clock yesterday
morning Mrs. Tibbitts and her hus
band. Robert Tibbitts, of the well- :
known firm of Healy & Tibbitts, went
for a drive through Golden Gate Park. ,
Before leaving the residence at '563
Eieiner street Mrs. Tibbius locked the
dresser drawer containing the' jewels
*nd carried the key with her. She
returned to the house after an ab
Â«encÂ«> of two hours, only to find that
*tll of her jewels .had; been putloined.
The Police Department was notified
r.nd Detectives Bunner and Matheson
Mere detailed on the case. After an
Investigation the Chinese . servant em- j
ployed by Mrs. Tibbitts and a Chinese '
employed in a similar capacity in an i
adjacent house were sent to the City ;
prison pending; further investigation.
Upon returning from her drive in the
park Mrs. Tibbitts, placing the key in
the lock, was . surprised to find that it
would not work. In trying to withdraw
the key the drawer opened easily and
the receptacle was found empty, with \
the exception of the coral necklace. " Â£
Detect! veg made a thorough examin- i
ation of the premises. The doors and j
â windows were found to be Intact and
no marks of a Jimmy were found on
any of them. None of the silverware
â¢was missing and nothing else of value
had been touched. An old rusty com
paÃS was found by the detectives on the
sidewalk in front of the house. This
fitted exactly with the marks on the
dresser drawer and is believed to be the
tool used by the burglars. During the
absence of Mr. and Mrs. Tibbitts the
Chinaman under arrest was the only
occupant of the house. He and the oth
er Chinese arrested protest their inno
cence.
The gems and jewelry, valued at
$5000, were purchased in Europe and
v>rf prized very highly by Mrs. Tib
bitte. She wore the jewels at many
notable social functions and they at
tracted much attention. The following
is the list of the missing valuables:
Powder box sÂ«t with rubies and diamonds,
locket mirror and coin pursÂ« with th* same
6*ttinKe. lorgnette mad* of old English gold '
and attached to a lon* heavy cold chain, gold I
watch with pearl Betting, p^arl. rubles and
diamond set dragon pin. large cluster diamond,
and opal ring, . turquoise and diamond cluster
ling, ring e*t with five pearls, brooch sn with
fifty-three diamonds.* Jade ring, ring set with
three large diamonds.", pearl mounted opera
glaawcs. long heavy gold chain and $50 la
currency. " .
The detectives are inclined to believe
that the burglar^ was an inside job,
and the Chinamen in \ custody will -be
Fweated by Captain Burnett and Chief
Dinan. - : . _

MAY WHEAT
WAR GROWS
EXCITING
Powerful Interests
Arrayed Against
Gates.
Seeelal Dispatch to The Call.
CHICAGO, April 16â John W. Gates
is facing the fight of his life in the
great May wheat deal. More millions
and mystery hover over the big deal !
than over anything/in the history of
grain speculation, not even excepting
the Harper deal, when Standard Oil
millions were supposed to have been
at one time involved.
The line-up on Gates' side is com
posed of wealthy associates and sym
pathizers in New York, St. Louis and
Minneapolis. The Eastern men know
little about wheat, but they believe in
Oates. The Western men involved
know a gerat deal about wheat and
are ranged with Gates because they
have believed, until recently, at least,
that his position was sound.
Opposing Gates are wealthy men of
various sorts. Many have graduated
from the field of grain speculation;
othrrs are now the greatest factors in
it. the world over, and a few unfa
miliar with wheat are against Gates
in the hope of evening up old scores.
The opponents of Gates are looking
forward to a time when the farmer and
the miller will gather all the wheat
available and sell it at the fancy prices
that the Gates deal has created.
Nature 1c working overtime against
the May deal. Clear and cold weather,
following rain and snow, has prevailed
for several days throughout the win
ter wheat belt, making it an ideal con
dition for the crop and putting it in a
position to withstand the rigors of
hot and dry weather as it approaches
the harvest.
The markets of the world are giving
way under the offerings and are now
very nearly at a level at which they
ran lay down contract wheat in Chi
cago at a good profit at May delivery
prices, despite the 28 cents per bushel
duty.

CHICAGO'S
CRUELEST
MAN FINED
Casper Gretch Holds:
Record as Wile-
Beater.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CHICAGO, April IÂ«.â Casper Gretch
was described by Justice Fitzgerald
yesterday as the "cruelest man in Chi
cago." Gretch was arrested on com
plaint of his wife, Mary. The woman
declared that her husband returned
home and demanded money, and, when
ehe refused to give him any, threw her
upon a stove. Then, seeing there was
no fire in the stove, he choked her,
pounded her with his flsts and beat her
with a razor strop.
Not satisfied with what torture he
had already inflicted, Gretch then took
a revolver and, forcing his wife's
mouth open, inserted the muzzle and
pulled the trigger, but the cartridges
failed to explode.
Suffering from her wounds, her eyes
swollen so she could hardly see, Mrs.
Gretch ran to the street and summoned
Policeman Conlon, who arrested the
husband. Gretch was fined $85 and
costs.

TONOPAH, April 16.â There were no
deaths here to-day, and only one yes
terday. Dr. Higgins, who to-day sent
eight specimens of blood and sputum
to Dr. Donald H. Carey of the marimi
hospital service at San Francisco, says
the result of the latter's analysis will
determine the nature of the malady
that has caused so many deaths here
during the last few weeks.
The town Is in charge of six commit
tees, each having a district. The com
mitteemen have been sworn in as dep
uty sheriffs. Their first work was to
order everybody to remove filth. The
committees worked all day Sunday and
far into the night. They admit that the
death rate for March and April is high,
but declare that the reports published
were greatly exaggerated. There is no
danger to persons observing the or
dinary sanitary rules.
Dr. Lee, who was sent here by Gov
ernor Sparks, says there is no cause for

FINE ARTS
SCHOOL IS
PROIECTED
Great Institution for
Columbia Uni
versity.
Half-Million Dollars to Be
Spent in Erection of
Building.
jenius of Americans in Painting,
Sculpture and Architecture
Will Be Fostered.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, April 16.â Plans for a
great school of fine arts, equal to the
Ecole dcs Beaux Arts of Paris, were
made public to-day by Dr. Nicholas
Murray Butler, presider. " of Columbia
University. They are based upon the
consolidation of the National Academy
of Design and the present art interests
at Columbia University to be aided by
the co-operation of the Metropolitan
Museum.
The idea has already received sub
stantial support from public spirited
citizens, who, it is said, contributed
at least $100,000 to finance the enter
prise, and it is believed there will be
little difficulty in raising the $500,000
necessary to insure the erection of a
building for the proposed school.
It is expected that the site which the
Academy of Design acquired at Am
sterdam avenue and Eleventh street,
where the temporary school ' now
stands, will be sold and the proceeds
applied to the maintenance of the pro
posed institution. The Academy will
then, if present negotiations be ap
proved, build on the northwest corner
of Southneld. opposite the university,
a structure in which will be housed
sehoois of painting, scufpture, archi
tecture, design and archaeolc/gy. all
tmder the general direction of Colum
bia .University.
This plan rests largely upon sugges
tions made by Sir Caspar Purdon
Clarke, the newly elected director of
the Metropolitan Museum of Art, who
came here a few weeks ago urging that
the museum must be h living institu
tion and that the genius of American
artists should be fostered.
Under the name c-f the Academy of
Design of Columbia University it is
believed plans for the promotion of
American art can be rapidly carried
forward. The work will naturally di
vide itself into three parts. The col
lege artll teach esthetics and the phi
losophy of art and the Academy of De
sign will teach technique and instruct
the pupils how to create works, while
the Metropolitan Museum of Art will
so arrange its collections as to make
them object lessons to the students.

PHILADELPHIA. April 16.â T. W.
Eckert. a vaudeville actor, went to the
apartments of his married daughter,
Maybelle, hsre this noon and found her
and her husband dead from asphyxia
tion. The husband was Louis Heck,
for years an aejor but of late leader of
the orchestra at Keith's Chestnut-street
[ Theater. Mis. Heck was an actress.
Eckert and his wife, whose home is'
in San Francisco, own the vaudeville ;
I sketch. 'The Two Moons. " They went
from New York last week, where they ,
had been playing, to, fill a week's en
gagement in Washington, and sent ,
word that they would visit the Hecks '
to-day. Eckert asked that his daugh-
I ter and son-in-law meet him at the j
| Broad street station.
The Ecktrts arrived at noon, and as j
neither Heck nor his wife appeared
Eckert left his wile at the station and
went to the apartment-house where the :
i Hecks lived. Failing to gain admit- !
j tance, he called the janitor and an in- j
; vesugation was made.
Mrs. Heck and her husband were
found dead. Tht room was filled with
gas. A physician who was summoned
said death had taken place fifteen hours
previously. All of the windows were
closed tightly and two of the gas Jets
of a bracket were open.
. Deputy Coroner David S. Frame, who
Investigated the case, rejects the theory
of double suicide and says the tragedy
undoubtedly was the result of an acci
dent. He could find no reason why the
I couple should commit suicide.
Mrs. Heck was dressed in a pretty
house gown. She was lying on a couch,
her head resting on a sofa pillow. Heck
had removed his coat and waistcoat.
He was in a sitting position on the
floor, with hie head resting on the
woman's knees.
Henry T. Jordan, manager of Keith's
Theater, says that so far as he knew
the couple lived happily. Heck was at
the theater yesterday afternoon and
seemed in good spirits. He did not ap
pear at the theater in the evening.
The table In the dining-room was set
for dinner and food had been prepared
in the kitchen. The gas stove w&3
lighted. It is believed that the couple
were asphyxiated soon after Heck ar
rived home from the theater. One of
the policemen advanced Jhe theory that
when Meek arrived Mmc he found his
wife dead, and sitting down to weep
over her body was also overcome. Mrs.
Heck suffered from heart trouble and
was at times despondent over it.
Mr. and Mrs. Heck were for years on
the vaudeville stage.

The presence of the Russian squadron
off the Annam coast is raising keen in
terest here in view of the possibility of

i? n<-- information from Vice Admiral
Rojestvensky's squadron, but the Ad
miralty would not be surprised to
learn of skirmishing between scout
ships to-day or to-morrow, as the be
ginning of torpedo-boat warfare soon
1p expected. The naval organ here ex
presses the opinion that Togo was
taken completely by surprise when Ro

entrance of the China Sea, and is now
concentrating hie widely scattered fleet
near the Pescadores, where it is be
lieved a sea fight will occur.
DO, April 16.â The Navy Depart

Â«KKS CHANGE IX SENTIMENT.
Russian < orrespondent on the Atti
tude of Americans.
*T. PETERSBURG. April 17. â The
Novoe Vremya prints* a dispatch from
New York saying that "the yellow
peril" is not now derided. Far-see
ing business men, with their eyes on
the Chinese markets, have, according
to this dispatch, finally awakened to
the growing political influence of Jap
anese over China and the prospect of
complete industrial domination in the
future. Hostility to Russia, the dis
patch continues, is really not against
Russian occupation in Manchuria, but
is due to the belief that it tends? to
monopolise the trade of this rich Chi
nese province. The dispatch says the
existence of a secret Chino-Japanese
treaty is already hinted, and adds:
"The danger threatens Europe as
well as Russia, and. if Rojestvensky is
beaten, all the powers, under the
leadership of America, may join to
make peace."
Editorializing on this dispatch, the
Novoe Vremya says it is no longer the
"yellow peril" which Europe and
America are now facing, and refers to
the words of a French savant, who,
when aÂ«ked how long the war would
last, replied:
"Two hundred years. Europe does
not seem to understand the terrible
truth."
The Novoe Vremya predicts that
"the enigma of the future historian
â will be the hostility of some European
nation toward the great struggle be
tween Japan and Russia, which render
inevitable a conflict between Russia
and Europe." and quotes the words of
the Vice Governor of Jerusalem on the
awakening of the Arabs in Asiatic
Turkey to show the deep-seated
hatred of Asia toward all Europeans
and the eventual menace of Europe â

CHANDLER TALKS OF PEACE.
Former Senator Says t World Moves :
by Controversy.
WASHINGTON, April Former j
Senator Chandler of New Hampshire |
presided and . was the principal i
speaker at a peace conference held j
to-day under the auspices of the j
Washington* branch of the Greenacre
Fellowship Association. Chandler
was rather pessimistic in regard to \
the prospects for/ international peace. .
He discussed the question in its varied {
aspects, and in this connection said: <
My life has not been spent where there was i
universal agreement. I have been used to dif- \
ferences of opinion such as are to be found in \
political societies, such as rule the states of J
mankind more than international council* i
and Greenacres It is through struggle, argu- j
ment and controversy that the world moves on. }
When I began I was pessimistic, but I- am not â 
hopeless. 1 have learned too much to dlsbe- J
lleve in tho future. In my ' lifetime" I have I
been slavery destroyed ana Cuba and the Phil- 5
ippines freed. The labors of â¢ good men, and Â»'â¢
women to put an end to war may. not be fruit- ;
less. It is not more hopeless -than the growth .
of humanity. If slavery was abolished in thÂ« '
nineteenth century, why should . not war be â -
abolished in the twentieth century?

THE MARRIAGE
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CHICAGO, April 16.â Rabbi Emil G.
Hirsch in a sermon at Sinai Temple
this morning, put the stamp of his ap
proval on the coming marriage of Rose
Pastor, the Jewish Journalist, to J. G.
Phelps Stokes, the millionaire settle
ment worker of New York, and mem
ber of an exclusive Episcopalian fam
ily. Although the preacher did not re
fer by name to the Stokes-Pastor en
gagement in the course of his sermon
on 'Intermarriage," he declared there
was nothing immoral in such mar
riages.
"I would not refuse to unite a Jewess
and a Gentile," he said. "The Jews
have been accused of secluding them
selves. This seclusion is the result of
the exclusion to which they have been
subjected by the non-Jewish world.
The right of intermarriage has never
been denied by the Jewish church."

One Thousand Delegates
From 44 Different Countries

ating officials of more than 400.000
miles of railway in forty-four different
countries, constitute the personnel of
the International railway congress

this city beginning May 4 next. At the
close of the congress the delegates are
to make a thorough inspection of the
railways of the United States. Dar
ticularly with reference to equipment
and shops. The congress is somewhat
unique in its organization, purposes
and manner of conducting its affairs.
It was organized in 1885, and has held
sessions every five years since. Its
first session, held ln Brussels, cele
brated the fiftieth anniversary of the
opening of the Belgian railways. Milan.
Paris, St. Petersburg and London have
been meeting places since, Paris having
had two sessions.
At the session in that city in 1900. the
invitation of President McKinlev to

ing the railways of this country, will
be A. J. Cassatt and E. H. Harriman.

COLLEGE GIRLS
ARE LECTURED
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CHICAGO, April 16.â College women
were excoriated for their lack of sym
pathy, courage and initiative accom
plishment of social work and the solv
ing of social problems yesterday after
noon by Miss Jane Adda ins of Hull
House and Miss Marion Talbot, dean of
women at the University of Chicago,
who spoke to a large audience of mem
bers of the Association of Collegiate
Alumnae in the rooms of the Chicago
Woman's Club on "The Relation of the
College Woman to Social Problems."
Miss Talbot declared that the girl of
to-day did not go to college for the
same reasons that drew women to the
college fold a number of years ago.
"There are girls who go to college,"
she asserted, "to improve their social
positions. In certain cases the fashion
able boarding-school plays a more
prominent part in their college life than
their studies. Such a condition among
college women is deplorable and ab
surd."
Miss Addams, who followed, said that
the college girl was not doing her share
in the solution of the social problems
because she lacked courage and initia
tive in approaching the task. She as
serted that a certain lack of emotional
tendencies had put college women at a
disadvantage in efforts for the better
ment of social conditions.

WILL OPERATE
MANY CANNERIES
Special Dispatch to The Call.
TACOMA, April 16.â One hundred
and thirty-nine salmon canneries will
be operated this year on PuÃet Sound.
FraÃer River and the Alaskan coast.
These figures do not include the Colum
bia River packers, because it is im
possible to determine now what can
neries will operate there.
The prospective heavy pack on Pusret
Sound is liable to create havoc among
the Columbia River packers, because
with a big pack on Puget Sound it is
difficult to dispose of river salmon. In
answer to inquiries these packers say
they cannot determine before June or
July whether they will operate. On
Puget Sound preparations are beinr
made on a scale ecftialing that of four
years ago when the pack on Puget
Bound reached nearly 1,400.000 cases.
Labor contracts have been made to the
full capacity of the plants.

proaching train. He was struck by

of thirty feet and then thrown about
forty feet into the air over a bridge
into the county road.

(5) The method of exploitation by sending to each inquirer, express prepaid both

ceived, involving a charge for express alone of about $48,000.
SAVING THE AGENTS' COMMISSION.
The adoption of this generous policy, involving the sale of the books at nearly half
their normal price, has been more than justified by the result. It has established the work
in public opinion quickly. The policy of not employing agents has pleased subscribers, and
the money which would have been paid in agents' commissions has gone directly into
their pockets in return for their good offices in taking promptly the first edition off

This newly completed work has been called the greatest story ever told, the history
of all mankind, 7ooo B. C. to 1904, narrated according to the only satisfactoy and perfectly

thousands of subscribers and by such high authorities as Ex-President Cleveland, Pro- \ V

Grand Opera House
Presents Good
Production.
Parts of Play Show
Real Dramatic
Strength.
There are features in the production
of "Ramona," now being given at the
Grand Opera-house, that make it in
advisable for the theater-going public
to overlook it. True, the play ac pre
sented will not produce a dramatic
furor, but it is well worth seeing, espe
cially by thfcse who have an affection
lM memory of the missions. Por
tions of the play may be said to be
slow, but there are parts that are full
of dramatic strength and thrill the
audience. Of course, as in the book,
sorrow piles up pretty rapidly.
The scenic effects are very good. In
the first act the home of Ramona is
ehown a* it stands to-day, with roses
clambering up its sides and the semi
tropical foliage- about it. To those who
havt never vusitfd it it is recognizable
at once from the pictures that an- so
well known. Allesandro's home at Pala
is an attractive creation, and the inte
rior of the San Carlos Plaza church at
Monterey is well reproduced.
Among the effective scenes the two
that lead are those where Senora Mo
rena makes her final attempt to in
duce Ramona to renounce the Indian,
Allesandro, and shows her the jewels
left by her father as a temptation, and
the weepy one where Allesandro and
his bride are forced to leave thc-ir home
after the burial of their child. Miss
Virginia Calhoun as Ramona does s .me
effective work in both these scenes.
Lawrence Griffith as Allesandro does
come strong acting. He has a melodi
ous voice that rite the part and he per
formed the mad scene cleverly, re
rig applause. The comedy of the
play ie supplied by Mrs. Louis Belmour
as Aunt Ri. She arouses hearty laueh
ter. Lee Willard is a graceful Don
Felipe and Miss Marie Baker a deter
mined Senora Morena.
Ihe costume dance at the anniver
of the wedding of Allesandro and
Ramona is an extremely pretty bit of
the production.
There is not an ordinary number on
the programme at the Orrjheum this
week. It is hard to pick the headliner
from the different acts, as they are

DR. PIKKCE'S REMEDIES.
A CLEAN MAN.
Outside cleanliness is less than half
the battle. A man may scrub himself â¢
dozen times a day, and ' *m \ /
still be unclean. ' Good ML
health means cleanliness W - \
not only outside, but in- Jfc<*>w
side. It means a clean M&B^wElk
stomach, clean bowels, jfllf â¢â ?Â§Â«&
clean blood, a clean J^fÂ§r;jSjÃ
liver, and new, clean, JrMjMV
healthy tissues and S- ffi fl \JT
bers in every organ of â¢ m|&'if?Â§A
the body. The man fl
who is clean in this
way will look it and act W $if *
it. He will work with Â»"t ' â
energy and think clean, clear, healthy
thoughts.
He will never be troubled with liver,
lung, stomach or blood disorders. Dys-
pepsia and indigestion originate in
unclean stomachs. Blood diseases are
found where there is unclean blood.
# Consumption and bronchitis
mean unclean lungs. Dr.
Pierces .Golden Medical
Discovery prevents these
diseases. It makes a man's
insides clean and healthy.
It cleans the digestive or-
gans, makes pure, clean
blood, and clean, healthy
flesh. It doesn-t make the
flabby fat of corpulency,
but the firm flesh of health.
It restores tone to the nervous system,
and cures nervous exhaustion and
prostration. It contains no alcohol
to inebriate or create craving for injuri-
ous stimulants.

PRINCESS SLAIN
IN INDIAN FEUD
Sceciai Dispatch to Tlie Call.
DES MOINES, April 16.â The stolid
silence which has prevailed among the
Tama Indians until to-day gave way
to an excited discussion of the mur
der of Princess Mas-Chf-Qua as the
result of the arrest of Georee Soldier,
her ex-husband and devoted admirer.
Deputy United States Marshal Healv
has thereby been enabled to develop a
chain of evidence that seems to point
conclusively to the commission of the
murder .for the purpose of preventing
the girl from becoming the mother of
an heir to the chieftainship as the
descendant of Puht Onoqua. who might
displace the present dynasty.
An old feud between the Sac and Fox
tribes, who iointly occupied the reser
vation, as to which is entitled to the
chieftainship, is back of a lone series
of crimes. John Sepo, an active parti
san, a relative of the prisoner. Georpe
Soldier, was murdered six months aeo.
presumably by a rival in love. Since
then two squaws have been slain. Mas-
Che-Qua disappeared two months asro.
having last been seen with her di
vorced husband, George Soldier. The
discovery of her dead body on Friday
was followed by Soldier's arrest and
the consequent discovery that he is
probably innocent and that the cold
blooded crime was committed for the
mere purpose of exterminiatine: a rival
dynasty.

WAR BETWEEN
DIVINES ENDED
Special Dispatch to The Call.
VALLEJO. April 16.â 1t is stated on
! reliable authority that hereafter there
will be but one Episcopal Church in
I this city, instead of two as has been
! the case ever since Rev. William Bol
| lard, rector of the Church of the Ascen
! sion, incurred the displeasure of Bishop
Moreland, head of the diocese of Sacra
mento. The long fight between Bishop
and minister has been settled.
Several years ago Mr. Bollard and
| Bishop Moreland locked horns, the
! former preferring charges against his
'â  superior. The Bishop was sustained
: by the Episcopal Conference, but Bol
! lard pluckily stuck to his guns, even
! refusing to turn over the church prbn
| erty in Vallejo to Rev. R. L. Macfar
i lane, who was sent to the navy yard
I town to take charge of the parish.
Bollard continued to lead those of his
flock who remained faithful to him.
and Macfarlane established the Mis
sion of the Holy Spirit for those who
took Bishop Moreland's side of the
controversy. v
It is understood that both Mr. Bol
lard and Mr. Macfarlane are to be
given desirable parishes away from
Vallejo, and that the worshipers at the
Church of the Ascension and the at
tendants at the Mission of the Holy
Spirit are to be once more broueht un
der one pastor at the old church. Mr.
Bollard, it is said, has been guaranteed
the payment of a note Ifor a laree sum
he holds against the diocese.

Time.
LONDON, April 16. â Business on
the Stock Exchange has been inactive
since the close of the settlement, oper
ators being disinclined for fresh busi
ness in view of the holiday and pend
ing the issue of the expected naval
battle. Cheap money has failed to
stimulate speculation, but quotations
generally have been maintained. Pro
longed ease of the money market is
anticipated in view of the large bank
reserve and the production of gold
in Australia, while arrivals from
South Africa, it is thought, will B uf
flce to meet the export demands.
Paris is still absorbing bar gold,
and it is believed will continue to do
so, while Russia withdraws money
from here. Americari securities were
the most active section, though still
largely In the hands of Wall-street

ajrainst the barristers' Congress here
and the prohibition of meetings of
other professional bodies in Moscow
and elsewhere, all of which, it declares,
is in direct contravention of the spirit
of the imperial ukase of March 3.
giving individuals and societies the
right to freely petition the throne on
the subject of the general welfare. At
the same time, the paper charges the
bureaucracy with inspiring the local
authorities everywhere to fight the re
form movement by setting one class of

"All the efforts of the bureaucracy

says, "will be in vain; the other tricks

POSSE SEARCHES
FOR TORTURICI
3lay Have Hidden in Lumber
Pile Near Place Where
Vilardu*N Head Was Found
DISOWNS HEX HUSBAND
Wife of Man Charged With
Brutal Murder Kenonnces
Him for His 111 Treatment
Within two blocks of where the head
and limbs of Biaggio Vilardo were
found, a man resembling Pietro Tor
turici has been lurking for two days
iv a lumber pile. He was seen twice by
Thomas O'Brien, who lives in the vi
cinity.
The police were notified last night
and a patrol wagon filled with police
men was rushed to the lumber pile,
which is at Dupont street, below Bay.
The pile was surrounded and Detec
tives Reynolds and Bell proceeded to
st-areh through the lumber.
After stumbling about fc-r some time
they eamt upon a nook In the pile
where some one had evidently been liv
ing. A pile of rags, an old coat that
had apparently been used as a bed and
a heap of cigarette butts were found.
, The posse lingered in the vicinity of
the lumber pile till an early hour this
morning, but the man did not return.
O'Brien says that he did not get a
good look at the fellow the first time
he encountered him, but last night he
saw him by the light of a street lamp
and was confident that it was Tortu
rici.
Rosa Torturici told a Call reporter
through an interpreter yesterday that
even if her husband were acquitted she
wo-uld not go back to him.
"He treated myself and the baby
shamefully," she declared. "I could
never live with him again. lam hap
pier here in the prison than I have
been for a long time. When I think of
my husband I shudder with fear."
The woman has recovered from the
state of terror she was in when first
arrested. She does not want to leave
the prison. She is afraid, she declares.
A dispatch received . last night from
Gridley announces that a man answer
ing the description of the fugitive in
every particular Is locked In the Jail at
that town, securely guarded.
The man was captured yesterday by
Constable James Porter and John Gar
lick after a hard chase. The suoDosed
Torturici has been hiding in the foot
hills of the Butte Mountains and was
traced to his lair with difficulty.
He came to Butte County last Friday,
leaving the train at Gndley. The man
did not tarry in the town, but struck
out immediately for the mountains.
He kept out of sight for a few days
but when almost starved asked foi"
food at the ranch of John Richardson.
Some Italian laborers, employed about
the place, talked to the stranger. After
he had left they told Richardson that
the man was a Sicilian and was trvingr
to hide from some one.
Richardson immediately notified the
constables and they started after him.
The man was overtaken on the road
near Pennington. He tried to dart into
the brush -that grows alonsr the hleh
way, but the stern command. "Halt Â»r
I fire!" brought him to a standstill.
The man refused to give his name or
to account for himself. On the way to
the jail he sobbed incessantly. When
searched an ugly looking knife was
found on him.

to the emotional, the south, where we look
for warmth; the north, those who study over
matters of emotion before accepting them, and
thÂ« west gates for . those . who have parsed
along in life, for Christ tells us it is never too
late. There la no need of hunting for the gate
at which some other person enter. Enter Into
thÂ» kingdom from where you are.

HORSE THIEVES
RAID RANCHES
LTVERMORE. April 16. â From a
lair in the mountains only a few miles
from Livermoro, from which it would
be difficult to drive them, even with
a large posse, a band of bold horse
thieves is operating against the stock
ranches of the valley, and already
Reveral of the ranches famed for their
high-bred stock have lost valuable
animals.
So bold have the thieves finally be
come that they have ceased to confine
their operations to the more thinly
settled parts of the valley, and have
stolen horses from ranches close to
th<- limits of the town. Not until last
night, however, was Livermore itself
visited, ;^i<l this expedition of the
thieves nearly resulted in the capture
of one of them.
The thief whose daring so nearly led
to his undoing made a raid on the
pasture of George Coughlan and suc
ceeded in getting away with two
valuable animals. Ho was seen by
Mrs. Coughlan, however, and she
quickly sent word to her husband,
who was away from home. Coughlan
at onre 'mounted a 'bicycle and pur
sued the thief, overtaking him on the
Dublin road, just outside the town
limit?.
The horse thief was ' riding one of
the stolen - horses and leading the
other. On being commanded :'.' by
Coughlan to halt the man released the
horse he was leading and attempted
to escape with the other, but Cough
lan 'fired two shots at him and, fearing
capture, the thief slipped from the
horse and escaped 1 in Â«the darkness.:

LOSES FAMILY
AND BUSINESS
Troubles of Confectionery
Man Whose Brother Takes
Management of His Store
MUCH DOMESTIC STEIFE
Financial Distress of Mer
chant Said to Be Aggra
vated by His Relatives
BERKELEY, April 16.â William
Wright has been succeeded in control
of his confectionery store, one of the
show places of the town, by Curtis
Wright, a younger brother, and the
elder Wright has left his home and
family at 2215 Fulton street, taking up
quarters in a rooming-house in another
part of the town. The brothers have
worked together for years, and the
family of the elder Wright is prominent
in the university town. Now Curtis
and William Wright do not Speak. Cur
tis has control of William's business,
and also acts as ex-offlcio guardian of
his brother's wife and children, living
with them, as he has for years, at the
Fulton street residence.
Into the kaleidoscope of events has
come the figure of Dr. Beighle, a spir
itualist healer of San Frtanciseo, who ,
is William Wright's mother-in-law, and
according to his story she is the person
responsible in part for the usurpation of
his place in the Center street store by
brother Curtis, and also for the sepa
ration of himself and wife. The moth
er-in-law held a mortgage on the es
tablishment and was able through a
local bank, which also held Wright's
paper, to assume control of the busi
ness and install- the younger brother as
manager.
William Wright is a brother of How
ard Wright, a former Speaker of the
State Assembly. He has given his
mother-in-law a bill of sale of the
showy candy store on Center street
upon condition that she assume all lia
bilities, amounting to about $7000, and
provide for his tw/> children until he
again engages in business for himself.
Meanwhile the bitterness between the
two branches of the family increases.
Hints of revelations that could be
made, if need should arise, regarding
William Wright's conduct of the big
confectionery bupiness come from the
lips of his younger brother, as he now
occupies William's former seat of power
in the establishment. William retaliates
be referring to Ingratitude, declaring
that for seven years he has provided
the younger Wright with a home and a
position. William Wright says:
My wife and mother-in-law and brother
have fn>zen me out of my business, ami I r.o
longer realda at the Wright h<in:e. They were
able to put me out, b cause if my money ob
ligations to them. 1 |f<se every dollar I have
put into the place, lnt Mentally, 1 have to
start anew and mako a new home for myself
and for the children, too. I phall engage in
buHlnoss here, and my friends, who arc not
slow to express appreciation of my difficul
ties, promise me support. It is a bitter thing
to experience, but I am taking the dose with
nothing mo;e serious than a wry face.
Curtis Wright says:
I have an unenviable position. I am put in
charge of my brother's former business
through no wlfh of mine. Those to whom his
Ddtat are made out appointed me manap^r.
His mother-in-law Is one of the creditors.
ThÂ» University Bank is another. I havo a.
mortgage myself of fSOO on the place. The
creditors were dissatisfied with my brother 1 !?
management and he gave up the business to
satisfy claims and permit of new manage
ment. We are making money now, whkh
was not the case befcre. We hope to save the
business and pay all claims. I shall not talk
now afKHit the claims of my brother William
thÃt lie has b<>en frozen out, but it would be
beal for him to be quiet. There is an abun
dance of niatHrial that could be produced to
disprove all hn says regarding unfair treat
ment or ?nap judgment and we might go back
even farther and cause much more serious
trouble with punitive measures looming in the
distance fnr brother William. He has not
supported me. but the reverse has been true.
Checks and documents will show (hat if nec
essary.

membership is elective and composed
of Master Masons of the universities.
The new chapter in Berkeley expects
to erect its own clubhouse near the
university campus and thus help to
unite Masonry at the university more
closely than it has been in the past.

Be Rich Prize for Russians.
The work of loading the steamship
Manchuria is being pushed night and
day. In her great cargo of 10.000 tons
she will carry a quantity of contraband
goods. In this list are a number of
heavy gun carriages and a big consign
ment of other war materials for the
Japanese Government. These were
brought alongside the freighter on a
barge yesterday. There were many
ponderous pieces of machinery In the
outfit, and Captain Wilson's ingenuity
will have to be brought Into play when
he begins to hoist them on board.
Besides this consignment the u-esael

dise of great value. She will prove a
rich prize should she fall Into the
hands of the Russian fleet.
The Manchuria will take a large num

on board having already been taken.
Although only about one-half of the
had been taken on board yester
day, the big gang; of longshoremen em

schedule time at 1 o'clock to-morrow
afternoon. She will stop at Honolulu

TO TRY MOTOR
CARS ON COAST
OMAHA, April 16.â Railway officials
who to-day made a 200-mile triD in
the Union Pacific gasoline motor car,
which will be placed in commission by .
that road to-morrow, express the opin
ion that tire success of the car will
result in a revolution of suburban and
branch line passenger and freight ser
vice. To-day's test of the Union Pa
cific car was the final one before plac
ing it in practical service between
Grand Island and St. Paul, Neb., where
it will make two trips daily as a
branch train.
The car, which was built purely in an
experimental way, seats twenty Der
sons. and in the forward end. where is
located the gasoline motor, is a space
reserved for baggage. The regular
service car, the construction of a num
ber of which will begin at once, will
be fifty feet long, will seat fifty-five
passengers and accommodate their
baggage. The cars will have a motor
of sufficient horse-power to haul one or
two trailers when it is found necessary
to use extra equipment.
Officials of a number of the larere
railroad systems of the country already
have interested themselves in the idea
which will be exploited at the comiriK
railroad congress at Washington. Prob
ably the greatest feature is the small
expense of operation. This, it is be
lieved, will be about one-sixth the cost
of operating regular passenger trains.
The idea of a railroad motor car ser
vice was conceived, by Vice President
Mohler of the Union Pacific and the
development of the car has been under
supervision of Superintendent of Mo
tive Power McKeen of that road. An
official -to-day said that the motor car
would place the railroads in fair com
petition with electric suburban lines
and give small branch towns a service
equal to that of the main lines. Sev
eral cars "will be placed in service on
the Pacific Coast as soon as they can
be built.

HERO OF SAMOAN DISASTER
COMES FROM ORIENT.
Lieutenant Wiley Returns on Sher
man From Philippines.
NAVAL OFFICER AND AKMY OFFICER, WHO ARRIVED YESTERDAY ON THE
TRANSPORT SHERMAN FROM THE PHILIPPINES. WHERE THEY HAVE
BEEN PROM IX ENTLY IN SERVICE FOR OVER TWO YEARS.
The' transport Sherman, from Manila,
arrived in port late yesterday after
noon. Captain C. J. Bruguiere reports
the trip rough and unpleasant until
they reached Honolulu. From there up
it was fairly smooth.
She brought her full complement of
cabin passengers and a large number
of enlisted and discharged men.
During the voyage, on or about April
5, a soldier named James M. Ward
disappeared from the vessel. The ship
was searched from stem to stern, but
he could not be found. It is supposed
jhe jumped overboard. He had been
suffering from a slight attack of melan
cholia. Ward belonged to Company D.
Seventh Infantry, and was a patient in
the hospital.
Colonel John L. Chamberlain, inspec
tor general's department, was among
the passengers. He has been stationed
In the islands for two years^and a half.
He joined the vessel af Nagasaki.
Colonel Chamberlain will be well re
membered in San Francisco, where he
was for several years connected with
the transport service. He is accompa
nied by his wife and son. They will re
main here a tew days and then proceed
to Washington, D. C.
Lieutenant Henry A. Wiley, U. S. N..
returns home after two years' service
in and about the Philippines. Lieuten
ant Wiley was in the naval catastrophe
in the harbor of Apia on March 15, 1889,
when the terrible hurricane destroyed
or disabled all the American and Ger
man warships in the harbor at that
time. Lieutenant Wiley was on the
Vandalla, which was carried on the
reef near the shore and sunk. He was
the last man to leave the ship. He
rendered great service in getting the
sailors ashore and refused to leave un
til the last man had been started for
the beach. Just as he was about to
jump overboard the ship went down
with a horrible crash and he was left
struggling in the floating wreckage and
foam. He struck out for the shore, but
the elements were too much for him.
The Samoans, seeing his gallant fight
for life, made a sort of human chain
among themselves, one end remaining
on shore and the other end swimming
out to where Wiley was struggling. He
was landed safely on the beach. For
his heroism he was highly praised by
his brother officers who were with him
In the catastrophe.
A MAJOR'S , RETURN.

has seen much service in the reserve
hospital in Manila, is returning home.-
Lieutenant Roy W. Ashbrook.

was on the island of Jolo. and with
Companies A and D of the Seven
teenth Infantry and a squadron of the
Fourteenth Cavalry they were pur
suing a Moro dato and a band of his
men. When they arrived at thf> Moro
fort Uncle Sam's troops Immediately
began an assault. The young officer
climbed upon the wall of the fort and
as he did so a spear hurled with tre
mendous force by a native struck him

home in Omaha, having received his
discharge from the army. He tells an
interesting story of how in May. 1904.
while in Mindanao, he went to the
rescue of Troop G of the Fourteenth
Cavalry, which had got lost in the
mountains. He says that with ten men
of Company L,, Twenty -second In
fantry, he went seventy miles into the
wildest kind of country in search of
the missing Troop G.
ALMOST STARVED.
When they finally reached the lost
cavalrymen they found them in al
most a state of starvation. They said
they had subsisted for fifteen days on
monkeys and water. Cavin had plenty
of food with his searching party to
relieve the wants of the starving men.
Cavin brings back with him a mag
nificent collection of trophies and
relics he collected while in the islands.
Among them are Mindanao bolos,
kampilan or two handed swords, be
heading knives. Moro cloths, wild
boars' tusks, which he took himself,
tom-toms, coats of arms, kris (cap
tured in the valley of Cotto Bato)

as the Need of Society
WASHINGTON, April 16.â The Na

Mrs. Leland Stanford. This declares:
"That the partnership of Interest, re
sponsibility, self-denial and aggressive
effort existing between Leland Stan

their struggle for material success fur
nished an example worthy of imita
tion," that it was in this partner
ship that Mrs. Stanford developed
those qualities which Justified her hus
band in making her sole executrix of
their large fortune, and that in Mrs.
Stanford's demonstration of the pos
session of sagacity. Judgment and fidel
ity which Justified her husband's \^Â»l,
the public respect for women has been
inevitably strengthened and increased.
The resolution speaks of the unparal
leled respect paid Mrs. Stanford at her
death and eaya this was justified by
this woman's life, whose habitual pru
dence, philanthropic service and ideal
fidelity hjtve lifted the standard of
public expectation of womanhood in re
spect to these qualities."
Resolutions touching the questions
of the true family life and other sub
jects were also adopted. They are as
follows:
Believing the progress of humanity is best
furthered by improvement of the individual
and that thr improvement of the individual is
depÂ«ndent ut>on hereditary environment an I
nurture, be it
Resolved. That the perfection of the home.
the insiitution in which heredity is fixed, the
first environment of thÂ» chlKi fjrmed. its firs:

TOPEKA. Kas.. April 16.â 1t develoDS
that the strike of the Santa Fe boiler
makers is an outgrowth of the strike
begun more than a year ago of the
machinists of the road. The strike waÂ»

Manager Mudge has made the following
statement:
The Santa Fe Company will not seek injunc
tions in the court aga'nst the striking boiler
makers at any of thÂ« points involved In the

ask of them Is that they do not interfere with
the operation of the company's shops. If they
do not care to work for us. all riÂ»h;
we can get Â« along without â  them. If thÂ«y

TRADE EXPANSION CONTINUES.
THE feature of trade continues to be its remarkabje expansion
all over the country, as shown by the bank clearings. This has
been going on for several weeks, as already mentioned. Last
week ninety-four cities and towns reported their clearings, and of
these eighty-two exhibited gains in the volume of business, ranging
from 77.5 per cent at New York down. It will readily be seen that
a large increase in speculation in Wall street might account for the
major part of Xew York's increase, but how about those scores of
other cities and towns which have no stock markets to expand the
clearings, and whose gains therefore represent just so much expan
sion in legitimate merchandising? There is only one deduction from
this exhibit, and that is there is a general increase of business
throughout the country, amounting last week to 52 per cent over the
corresponding week last year. The clearings themselves rolled up
the remarkable aggregate of $3,003,700,000.
Other statistics support the clearings. The railway earnings in
March gained 10 per cent over last year, and the gain for the first
quarter of the year was 5 per cent. The failures for the week were
214, against 225 last year. The demand for iron and steel has become
*n enormous that the mills are not able to fill it and the United
States is now importing steel from Europe to satisfy its requirements.
This showing, too. is supported by supplementary reports, as, for in
stance, one from the building industry calling attention to the re
markable activity in all sorts of building throughout the country.
Lumber is likewise improving in demand and stronger markets are
reported in many sections.
Supplementary also to this is a general activity in real estate,
but on this latter score the cautious observer of trade conditions finds
a chance to shake his head dubiously. Thus a well-known New York
financier says : "Just now real estate is experiencing one of those pe
riodic booms for which the United States is noted. Land values are
rising rapidly and new buildings of all sorts are being erected. It can
not be said, however, that the speculation in real estate has yet ob
tained dangerous proportions : much of the activity is perfectly legiti
mate and seems destined to continue for some time to come, although
\\e!l worth remembering that the climax of all great upward
movements in the United States has usually been marked by a real
estate boom. History shows that these movements in real estate
have almost invariably marked the crest of a forward wave, and while
the top may not have been reached, there is no reason to see why this
particular movement should be any exception."
Especially cheering reports are coming in from the South, owing
t" its fine returns from cotton during the past year, and from the
which has been equally fortunate with its great grain crops
and dairy products. The populous States of the East, too. report their
mills and factories very busy, with no serious labor disturbances. In
fact, the labor question, which for half a dozen years was so trouble
some, has apparently settled itself for the time being, and employers
and their wage-workers seem to be working harmoniously together.
This excellent condition in itself may account for much of the cur
rent expansion in trade, for when everybody is fully employed and
industriously at work for himself and family times must necessarily
be good.
The staples, upon which the country depends for its prosperity.
are almost uniformly in excellent condition. We look in vain for
depression in any one of them. Cotton, wheat, corn, oats, hides,
leather, footwear, clothing, hardware, iron and steel, lumber, dairy
products, copper, gold and silver mining, city and country lands,
stock markets, real estate, money markets â all are sending in, week
after week, with almost unvarying uniformity, reports of noteworthy
activity, with prices higher than the normal. The merchant, manu
facturer and farmer are all doing a great deal better than they did
for a long time, while the quantity of ready money, not only in this
country but in Europe, is so vast that it is more or less a problem as
to how it can be profitably employed.
Such is the condition of trade at the beginning of the second
quarter of 1905. If the rest of the year keeps pace with the first
quarter the year will be a banner one.
THE SOCIAL ORGANISM.
THOUGHT work done by the individual mind is an idea with
which we are of old_ familiar, but the conception of the s-.cial
organism as itself a thinking entity, working out mental prob
lems which are beyond the intellectual power of any one of :hat or
ganism's multitude of units, iÂ« of comparatively modern recognition.
There are three recent notable events which taken together suggest
some thoughts on the working of the big co-operative brain of the
newly discovered being, the social organism. One of these events
is the sermon recently delivered in this city by Dr. Henry Van Dyke,
professor of English literature at Princeton ; a second, the address of
another noted divine, Bishop Potter, at the dedication of the new
building of the International Young Men's Christian Association in
.Yew York: and a third, the description of the mechanism of the hu
man brain given recently by the great German biologist, Haeckcl.
Dr. Van Dyke's sermon was a masterpiece. He used as a text
"Our Citizenship Is in Heaven.'' In the splendid picturing of this
citizenship, and setting forth of its honor, obligation, power and
hope, he spoke a few emphasized sentences for unity in religion. He
gave strong expression to the belief that we have to face big prob
lems â problems that he did not know, that no man knew, that no
one religious denomination knew how to solve ; they could only be
dealt with co-operatively by our citizenship which is in heaven.
Dr. Potter said he acclaimed it as one of the most interesting
historical occasions that had occurred in New York in his lifetime
that he stood on the same platform with a priest of the Greek
church and a rabbi of the Jewish church, together with ministers
of all the Protestant denominations, to promote a work in the in
terests of humanity. He said : "This building stands for the decay
of creed animosity."
Haeckel tells us that the human mind is built up of millions of
tmy cells, which receive and register fragments of knowledge : by
means of minute fibers, perhaps analogous to telephone wires, these
cells are formed into groups which intercommunicate with other
groups ; still higher groups have the function of collecting and co
ordinating the various intimations from groups below; and so ever
with the multiplication of knowledge there go telegraph messaged
to more centralized stations where the many sensations received from
the outside world are co-ordinated, until at last they reach the highest
function of the brain, which is the seat of the intellect of man.
By some sort of analogous system we might conceive of the
social organism having a mind capable of solving problems as far
beyond the power of the individual brain as is that brain's highest
functions beyond the capacity of some single group of the cells which
are its components. For part of the co-ordinating work some sort
of wireless telegraphy might take the place of the fibers that serve in
the brain of the individual. It may be that Bishop Potter gave ex
pression to his liberal view only because the times were ripe for it
but the problems Dr. Van Dyke speaks of as being beyond solution
by individuals, or even whole denominations, may be solved by the
operation of some kind of co-operative thought of the social or
ganism.
The resignation of George C. Holden, the Philadelphia postomce inspector
because he had borrowed money from an enterprise whose methods have been
criticised by the Postofflce Department and are now under investigation is
evidence that there is some public conscience left. â Pittsburg Gazette.
Amelia E. Barr says the human family loses 86 per cent of its power
because it does not practice ambidexterity. Still, think of what it saves owing
to the fact that the politicians can't graft with both hands. Denver Republi
can.

Under the changing skies we strolled,
Sunshine and rain above us played,
And the old. old tale was the one I toli
Since I was a man and she a maid.
Many and many a year has gone
And April is smiling in tears again;
I am facing her fickle self, alone.
And proving her blandishments worse than vain;
Much shine and shower have served to let
My heart grow wise and my passion cool;
At length I am even past regret
That she was a woman and I a fool!

MUD GEYSER AT
SHASTA DUE TO
WATER PRESSURE
To the Editor of The Call:
The mud spring at Sisson la not an
uncommon phenomenon attending vol
canic cones with glaciers at their sum
mits. If the mud were hot, accompa
nied by evidences of steam pressure, or
If the opening of the spring had been
attended with vibratory motions of
more or less violence, volcanic disturb
ance might have been presumed, but
around every volcanic peak crowned
with glaciers there are glacial springs.
The Seenegas, some two miles above
Sisson, which is the true source of the
Sacramento River, has a glacial origin.
Mount Shasta and Lassens Butte are
thrown up very loosely. Their sides
are covered with volcanic slides. The
snow melt and rainfall upon their sum
mits and higher altitudes do not flow
over the surface, but sink Into subter
ranean channels â Fall River, Ash
Creek, Mud Creek and the Sacramento,
and on the north Butte Creek. All have
glacial origin.
â Smart Set.
The mud spring, or geyser, at Sisson
is no doubt due to water pressure. This
may be continued until the mud Is ex
hausted or additional openings in the
crevices of the rocks afford larger vent
to the water which la seeking to escape,
and ultimately a clear spring may be
established. The water pressure be
hind this mud. however, may subside
by reason of its finding- vent through
the glacial Bprings already established.
Lassens Butte, or Mount Lassen, as
it is sometimes called, presents more
distinct volcanic manifestations than
Mount Shasta. There is one lake at the
foot of that mountain comprising five
acres of boiling hot water. The vi
bratory motion of more or less violence,
accompanied by the rumbling sound,
are volcanic manifestations often expe
rienced in the vicinity of this mountain.
The Feather River takes its rise in the
vicinity of this Butte, in what is
known as Big Spring, which is the
largest issue of the kind in the State.
Fall River, one of the glacial streams
of Mount Shasta, issues from the earth
the full size of the river from its source
to its mouth. It receives no tributary
and is not subject to flood variations,
except the slight subsidence of the ice
melt in the glacier which supplies it
during certain months of the year.
In addition to the many tine springs
and notable streams with which vol
canic peaks are attended, there are
numerous small springs, the sources of
small streams and rivulets, which
scarcely attract notice.
Briefly considered, the vast deposits
of snow and ice on the summit of these
cones continually move downward and
are melted. The rainfall in the middle
altitudes reinforces this water suppl

sides of the mountains will not adm
of the surface delivery down the d
clivlty of the mountainside it sinks in
the beds of broken rock and sand, sc

fcot of the mountains. The appearance
of mud geysers should not occasio
apprehension, since it is merely an in
dicatton of water pressure In a new di
rection, which may persist or subside
in obedience to the law of the "line of
hast resistance." which governs the
direction of all force. A. O.

The rower that resemblance to one
beloved has over the affections has
been suggested often enough by nov
elists. The man who marries hir wife's
twin sister and the one who falls in
love with the daughter of aa oIA
sweetheart because she is a replica of her mother, appear in fiction as fre
quently and fatlguingly as the names of certain members of the 'four hun
dred" do in the weekly columns of 'What's What and Who's Who?"
The emotional stimulus of seeing on a new face a fleeting familiar
expression which recalls some dear and unforgotten joy is occasionally based
as a poetic motive. But Katherine Thurston has struck a deeper note than
either of these, and one of richer tone.
Nobody knows, or can know, Just how far a man's shell ordinarily
affects either his career or his success in love. We like to regard it as*
a non-determinative factor; for this attitude both consoles and flatters the
men who are not so good looking as it would be pleasant to have them,
and It sets up a masculine ideal of strength and intellect which is in agree
able contrast with the admired feminine types of delicate beauty and yield
ing grrace.
But certainly in this special case under discussion John Loder's
resemblance to Chilcote was more than Just a letter of Introduction which
gave him a hearing with Eve, the disappointed wife; it was a passport to
her favor.

THE POWER OF RESEMBLANCE
Notable Effect of Physical Likeness on the Af
fections and Emotions.
DOROTHY FENIMORE
THE author of 'The Masqueraders" has put new life into the old ques
tion- How far may physical resemblance between two men influence
m favor of one of them a woman who is bound to the other by ties
of close relationship? She has given us a chance to look at this
problem, which Amelle Rives made a subject of discussion some years
ago by her novel, "The Quick and the Dead," from a new angle, and to
study it by critical Instead of intro
spective methods.
Into the life of a beautiful woman,
of fine emotional and intellectual fiber,
came two men, who, so far as form
and feature went, were cast by nature
in the same mold. The one, her hus
band, was, by his own confession,
'born without capacity for love."
And to this lack of his nature was
added weakness of purpose.
The other, the masquerader, whom,
by a trick of circumstance, she be
lieved for a long time to be the man
she had married, was in every par
ticular except outward appearance the
exact opposite of his physical counter
part. The first man she had learned
to loathe and the second one she had
learned to respect and love, while be
lieving him to be the first.
Of course, the question is primarily
one of personality. The real husband,
Chilcote, belonged to what Emerson
called the south, or negative, pole of
character, and the masquerader, John
Loder, belonged to the positive, or the
north, pole. The one repelled and tjie
other attracted. ButA undoubtedly,
the latter's resemblance to the for
mer was a strong factor In effecting
Eve Chilcote's spiritual surrender.
Had she not longed, with womanly
instinct, during the four sad years of
disillusionment to love in som** degree
the man to whom her life was linked,
would she have been so ready -*s she
was to forgive and forget, to trust
him, and to hODÂ« for a better future?

Easily Formed but Hard to Break.
X man down in old Virginia tells of
his experience, which points a simple
and effective way out. He Â»ayÂ»:
"'About fifteen years aÂ«o my wife,
through ueirisr coffee and laudanum
for relief of neuralgia, became ad-
dicted to the habits, continuing until
she had about destroyed stomach,
nerves and mind. This brought on
periods of dementia lasting from one
to two weeks, growing steadily worse
until the Sd of August, last yc-ar. our
family physician called in consultation
another doctor, who had â¢ been resi-
dent physician at our State : Insane
Asylum.
'They decided the onjy hope was to
place her in a sanitarium, otherwise
she would be hopelessly Insane before
the year was out. On investigation we
found the charges for such a. patient
beyond our means, bo it wafi"necessary
to face the worst at home.
"Upon the advice of a friend she
.â  .opped the use of coffee, of which she
was very fond, and began the use of
Postum Food Coffee as a remedy for
the constipation which accompanied
the attacks. The result was more
than we expected. It not only relieved
the constipation greatly, but aided her
to break the laudanum habit, for when
she found herself possessed of the de-
sire to 'take something" a cup of
strong Postum would allay the desire
and soothe and refresh her.
â¢This led to the regular use of Pos-
ium and Grape-Nuts, that also seemed |
to nourish and strengthen the over-
Trougrht nerves, she steadily got bet-
ter and better, and to-day, in-
stead of being in an insane
.iFjium, she is , still with us in i
her own home, sounder in mind and
tÂ»ody than for several years past. The
â¢tt tacks of dementia have steadily
crown milder and less frequent until i
now we have every reason to believe
that she will soon be fully restored â
sound in mind and body.
"I know this has been accomplished
entirely by the aid of Postum and I
Grape Nuts, for not since that consul-
tation over a year ago has she taken
a particle of medicine' of any sort.
"In writing this my greatest desire is
to bring the use of your products to the
notice of some other unfortunate, trem-
bling upon the brink of?that most terri-
ble of all calamities. Insanity, and I
thoroughly believe and know, that leav-
ing off coffee and other drugs and tak-
ing good food and drink is the surest
means by which it can be averted. , I
pive the name of our family physician,
also the consulting physician, who can
vouch â â â 'â¢< * truth or Z wnat I- have
written. You Â«re eit liberty to furnish
name and address to any one really in- J
terested." Nam* given by Postum Co., ]

It is with deep regret that the club
women of the State will learn of the
serious illness of the president of the
State Federation. Mrs. Georsre Law
Smith â than whom no woman in the
State is better beloved.
That Mrs. Smith possesses the warm
friendship of thousands of California' 6
wideawake club womenâ and hosts
without the State, whom she met dur
ing the biennial at St. Louis â is the
natural result of a charming personality
and a splendid poesessibn of tact and
world-knowledge. It is these qualifi
cationsâand premarily her tactâ that
made her administration of the Cali
fornia Club an era to be remembered
; ieasure.
Late last niyht it was learned that
the sufferer was improving and her
physician entertained hopes of her be
ing able to sit up at the weeks end.

The regular monthly meeting of the
department of education of the Califor
nia Club was held on April 7, when an
address was given by Charles B.
Greene, librarian of the Oakland Public
Library-, on â¢'Traveling Libraries, and
the Library Extension Work Under
taken by the California State Library."
Mr. Greene's lecture was instructive,
humorous and full of telling points. He
recalled the time when all visitors to
the San Francisco Public Library were
given a sort of dog check as they en
tered the door, and they could not ob
tain a book without formalities, that
showed they were under suspicion of
desiring to steal books, and could not
go out the door without accounting for
themselves and their checks.
The contrast between the old way and
the new la marked, as libraries not only
have open shelves, but books are sent
cut by freight to borrowers hundreds
of miles away. Even the $3 fee at first
charged by the State Library as pay
ment of freight has been abolished, and
railroad and stage charges are paid by
the State from a surplus fund.
Mr. Greene gave unlimited credit to
women's clubs for their work in behalf
of traveling libraries, and especially to
the California Club, which inaugurated
the work in this State. The club is still
sending out six sets of books to ap
plicants.
The State Library has now 112 such
libraries traveling about, has three
more ready and fifteen more forming.
Nearly all the counties have borrowed
books.
An especially interesting development
at the movement has been the sending
out of books in embossed type for the
blind- Such books are very bulky. "Rob
inson Crusoe" being three very large
volumes and the Bible sixty-five. By a
Vnited States law books for the blind
may be sent free through the mails,
both pning and returning.
Mr. Greene advocates the appoint
ment of a new library officer, to be
called a State library organizer, to con
tinue the work begun by small travel
ing libraries and assist the small towns
In installing libraries of their own.
A final report on the bird day bill
was made to the department by Mrs.
Alice L. Park. Audubon committee. The
bill passed both houses of the Legisla
ture, but suffered a pocket veto.

"A MOST , A-S-T-O-U-N-D-I-N-G FACT!"

publicly testifies: . â  .
"THIS IS TO CERTIFY, that, having been
B-N-T-I-R-E-L-Y D-E-A-F
in one ear more than TEN YEARS, I re- i
ceived 3 short (DRUGLESS) treatments of a
FEW SECONDS each, of REXKAJL>IO, the
HUMANIZED R-A-D-I-U-M Healer. After
I the first, my ear was instantly able to hear a ;
'WHISPER at more than 20 feet, moat dis- ;
tinctly, much to my astonishment, as here- â 
tofore I have been a thorough UNBE-
LIEVER In this treatment "(as many are
who have not TRIED it).' To-day, im-
mediately after the third treatment of 3 .

all such, to try Rexadlo's truly WONDER- â 
FUL - healing power. Respectfully, D. M. I
CASHIN."
Mr. Grant Hammond, relative, of .John
Hays Hammond, witnessed the above phe- i
.. nomenal healing; also was himself by one |
. treatment entirely and Instantly relieved of j
the severe pains of LIVER affection. Since
than, many foremost citizens, on the strong ]
personal advice of Mr. Cashin, have flocked
to Rexadio's offices for treatment; their '
equally REMARKABLE and ASTONISHING
testimonials will here be published later.
Mr. Cashin says he was urgently persuad-
ed to consult - Rexradio by a . prominent
financier, who declared he had been prompt- :
1 ly and almost "miraculously" cured of a
terrible life-long disease, which all others â 
had failed to help, though ha had spent
thousands seeking cure.
SEVERAL THOUSANDS of wonderful ,
testimonials have been received by Rex- â

HUNGARY WANTS
SPECIAL TARIFF
System of Reforms Proposed
to Put an End to Present
Crisis in Dual Monarchy
NEW TREATIES DESIRED
Compromise Possible Where
by Crown May Have Its Way
on Language for the Army
BUDAPEST, April 16.â The movement
to establish a customs tariff for Hun
gary alone as distinct from the present
Austro- Hungarian tariff is graining
strength and popularity here and is
becoming an Important factor in the
serious question of Austro-Hunsrarian
relations. This matter came ud prom
inently in 1898, when Hungary even
â went so far as to prepare a schedule
of rates for the proposed independent
tariff. Hungary to-day is able to take
this step of an independent nation un
der the so-called law of 1899. passed
by the Hungarian Parliament and
signed by the King that year, which
empowers Hungary at her own will to
establish an independent customs tariff
and denounce the existing commercial
treaties in so far as she was concerned
therein.
The supporters of this movement de
clare, first, that all details as to rates
of the new tariff can be prepared with
in a month; second, that a system of
new commercial treaties should be
drawn up; third, that Hungary can
obtain only a successful settlement of
her customs situation by excluding
from her treaties with foreign states
a general application of the favored
nation clause; fourth, a national Hun
garian bank should and can be estab
lished; and, fifth, that Hungarian and
Austrian commercial relations can be
entrusted In the beginning to Hun
garian and Austrian officials attached
to existing Austro-Hungarian embas
sies, legations or consulates.
Hungary's liberty and ability to un
dertake and carry out such steps as
the foregoing are recognized and the
belief here is growing that Hungary
will do this and yield to the crown for
the present on the matter of the use
of Hungarian as the army command
language.

THOUSANDS WON
BY BIG STABLES
Only Three More Weeks of Racing at
Track Across the Bay.
Racing will continue at Oakland only
three weeks longer, the clo .ng day of
the season being Saturday. May 6.
With few exceptions owners will wait
here until thr end and the class of
horses remaining assures high-class
sport, it jp planned to make distance
races a feature of the last day. The
card will include a cup race at two
mile* and a quarter.
Among the features this week will be
two $1000 handicaps. There is one for
"Wednesday at a mile and a furlong, in
which the best horses are expected to
meet. Ob Saturday there will be a
handicap at a mile ana three-six
teenths for four-year-olds and upward.
This should also attract a fine field.
Walter Jonning-s, who left a few
few horses here, will doubtless pass the
$20,000 mark before the season closes.
Dr. Rowell will soon be in second place.
Many owners have shared in the $380,-
000 distributed in stakes and purses by
the New California Jockey Club. The
principal winners are:

TENNIS TROPHY
FOR THE BAKERS
Some extremely Interesting tourna
ment tennis matches were played yes
terday on the court*. On the California
Club courts the first of a series of class
singles tournaments for the new cups
was played. On the park courts the
finals of the handicap doubles tourna
ment, commenced two weeks ago, were
:eted. As a result of this match
the Baker brothers, George and Neil,
become the owners of the cups, which
have been competed for during the past
three years.
The match yesterday was declared by
to \>e the closest and most inter
esting played on the public courts for
some time. I^e Baker brothers (owe
15 3-6) were opposed to Guy Lytton
and Pred Adams (scratch), and the
handicap proved just about right. The
Baiter*, as usual, played a steady, ac
curate game and were declared winners
after five sets had been played. Adams
and Lytton played a fast game in the
opening set and took all kinds of
chances.. They won this set easily, and
nied they would break up the safe
game of their opponents. The Baker
â  re adopted more aggressive tac
â  tht second set and won it hand
ily.
The third set was the closest of the
and the outcome hung in. the bal
ance until the last stroke had been
made. The Bakers finally won by a
10-8. The winners seemed
tired from their exertions, while Adams
and Lytton were getting stronger all
the time. They took the fourth set
vithout the lose of a game. The Baker
~rs. realizing that only one set
â was between them and the trophies,
made a determined effort and captured
the fifth Â»et quite handily. The com
*< ore wa? 3-6, 6-2. 10-8, 0-6. 6-2.
N. Baker was the star of the four, Lyt
iiso played a surprisingly good
game.
The tournament at the California
Club furnished an unusual number of
close matches. The first class vu rath
er unsatisfactory owing to several de
faults in the lower half. Herbert Long
â won the class honors. He first beat
Carl Gardner and then disposed of his
brother. Melville Long. In the lower
half Frank Mitchell beat George Busch
and then defaulted to George Janes,
who drew in the first round. The latter
did not put in an appearance, and the
final match went to H. Long by default.
No second class players were on hand
and play was postponed until next Sun
day. r
EvÂ«ry match played In the third class
requited the full three sets to settle the
question of supremacy. The matches
â were no long that the finals had to be
postponed. Moulton and George
Cutter were the successful players and
will meet in the finals next Sunday.
The surprise in this class wai the de
feat of Albert Ken yon at the hands of
â v\\ G. Knowlton. The "iron man" sur
prised even his most ardent admirers
by downing Kenyon in an extremely
close match. Knowlton also won the
first set from Cutter. The latter proved
too strong for him In the next two sets.
In the fourth class Daniel Volkman
and Edwin Bacon reached the finale.
Volkman and William Johnson fur
nished the beat match of this class. All
three sets were close and Volkman won
by the narrowest of margins.

REJECT AFFILIATION
WITH ENGLISH UXIOX
INDIANAPOLIS, .April 16. â The
proposed plan of affiliation with the
Amalgamated Society of Carpenters,
an English organization, submitted by
the organization after an overwhelm

by the Carpenters and Joiners of
America by a vote of almost 3 to 1.
A committee of six has been appoint

from the English organization to
formulate plans more acceptable to
the interests of both organizations.
The English organization controls
about 7000 members in the United
States and Canada and the Carpenters

SCHUETZEN CLUB IN THE BIG FESTIVAL HELD ON THE RANGES NEAR SAN RAFAEL. THE AFFAIR WAS PRO
NOUNCED THE MOST SUCCESSFUL EVER GIVEN THERE.
TALAGOOS LOSE
LACROSSE GAME
SAN MATEO, April 16 â The first la
crosse game of the season brought de
feat to the champion Talagoos and the
Olympics have gone back to the
metropolis with a clean victory won by
a score of 8 goals to 5. It was a
case of the survival of the fittest, as
the Olympics won the match in the
last seven minutes of play by supe
rior endurance. Up to that time the
score remained a tie when three goals
in quick succession gave the visitors
the victory- The Olympics furnished a
star player In W. O'Brien, who scored
five of their eight goals, while Mike
Lyons scored four for the Talagoos. It
was largely the clever work of his
brother, Martin, the "Red," which
made his scores possible.
The Talagooe took the lead In the
first period with two goals in succes
sion by Mike LyonÃ. When it closed
the Olympics also had two made by
Mlnto and O'Brien. In the second pe
riod Mike scored twice, O'Brien once
and Lynch once, closing the period
with another tie, the score being 4 to 4.
An unusually brilliant play was
made in this period by the three Lyons
boys and Frank Brown, in which the
ball never touched the ground from
the time Martin Lyons secured it at
one end of the field until Mike goaled
it at the other. The feat was accom
plished without an error by passing
the ball back and forth between the
four players. This is the essence of la
crosse. The tie remained unbroken
throughout the third period as neither
side could score. McCarthy had re
tired with a disjointed finger and
Lundqulst took his place.
The scrambles were frequent and
fierce and several knockouts occurred,
but no goals. In the fourth O'Brien
put the Olympics in the lead by a goal.
When this was offset with one by Jim
Lyons and the end was near it looked
like a tie game, but the Talagoos
seemed to break down suddenly, play
ing wildly and making it easy for
Scanlan and O'Brien to up three
more goals, which gave their side the
game. The teams:
Talagoosâ J, Demara, W. Tobin, J.
Pease, F. Brown, Dr. Sissons, Martin
Lyons, W. Demara, J. Lyons, Mike
Lyons. A. Smith, G. A. Bigelow.
Olympicsâ D. McQuaig, T. Wilkinson,
N. Dunn, F. Burden, George Mountz,
D. McCarthy, F. Lynch, F. Scanlan, W.
O'Brien. C. H. Minto.

The most successful shooting festival
held here was closed yesterday at
Schuetzen Park by the California
Schuetzen Club. There were more than
125 riflemen participating And more
than 3500 shots were flred. The club
was organized in 1876 for the purpose of
upholding the marksmanship of Cali
fornia against the world at the Centen
nial exhibition, held in Philadelphia
that year. At this great, contest teams
were sent from all parts of Europe and
America to win the trophies offered for
good marksmanship. The California
Schuetzen Club carried off the first
honors of the day.
The scores made at yesterday's shoot
show how well the California marks
men maintain their skill with the rifle.
On the honorary target A. Hinterman
made 74 rings out of a possible 75, be
ing closely followed by F. E. Mason
with 73.
On the ring target Otto Bremer led
the march for scores with 73. F. Brandt
was second with 72, being pressed hard
by A. Strecker and F. E. Mason with
71 each.
D. B. Faktor proved his consistency
by scoring the highest ten tickets on
both targets, making a total of 695, be
ing an average of nearly 70 rings.
On the ring target A. C. Gehret and
Otto Bremer tied, with 349 each in five
entries.
During the midday banquet, held in
the large dining pavilion, at which all
marksmen and their families were
guests of the club, President Philo Ja
coby, Captain F. A. Kuhls and Vice
President Rahwyler made- remarks in
reference to the encouragement of
marksmanship as a guarantee for the
safety of the Government against for
eign invasion. Each paid a tribute to
the large number of ladies who had
graced the occasion. A novel feature
of the festival was the enthusiasm
shown by the ladies who are. relatives
of members of the club. Some of them
took a hand in the contests and showed
they knew how to handle a rifle. Miss
Ethel V. Ott was high with 46. Mrs. G.
W. Maxwell also made 46 and Miss H.
Blasse 83. Mrs. E. Woenne and Mrs.
H. Scheunert also made creditable
scores and received congratulations for
their skill.
Conniderable rivalry was manifested
for the extra premiums that had been
set out for competition in bullseyes and
center shots, and every shooting stand
was crowded when the hour of opening
the targets arrived. M. F. Marshall of
San Jose had his shooting eyes with
him. As soon as the targets were in
position he steadied his rifle and pulled
at the right time. The red flag waved
by the marker was. the signal that he
had made the first center of the day.
The next premium, which was for the
first was won by F. Schu
macher, also of San Jose. The second
25 was made by Champion F. E. Mason,
the third 25 was carried off by G. A.
Stengel of Palo Alto. The last bullseye
of the morning was made by W. F.
Blagse. The marksmen sent up cheer
after cheer when William Ehrenpfort,
who is past 75 years of age, opened
the afternoon performance by making
a dead center, winning the premium
for good marksmanship. A. G. Qehret
was the lucky rifleman to place his bul
let in the right spot Just before the tar
gets went down on a successful gather
ing of sharpshooters.
Among the visiting marKsmen who
attended the festival from outside of
this city were:
Ban Jor,e Rifle Clubâ M. F. Marshall. Rob
ert Wight. F. Schumacher, Peter Knoble M

STOCKTON HOUND
A FALLEN IDOL
Mr. Zignego, the greyhound from
Stockton, which many thought a world
beater, fell from his high pedestal yes
terday at Union Coursing Park. After
winning two stakes In succession the
son of Fetter Free finally succumbed to

in the fourth round of the open event.
The score was 3 to 2, showing the
Slough City courser made a game fight
for supremacy.

to Uncle in the morning game. 1 to 0.
The Tigers were there with one of
those ancient finishes In the twelfth
spasm of the last game. Both were
battles replete with heart-rending inci
dents and great pitching, but there was
not batting enough in either game to
keep an old-time fan from dreaming of
the bygone days.
Young Henley, who had the honor of
twirling the afternoon game because
Jimmy Whalen was chased by the um
pire, tossed big league ball for eleven
innings. In the twelfth he weakened.
The strain was too much for an untu
tored busher and the Tigers waded in
for two runs when the youngster was
in the lofty altitude.
For mechanical baseball the game
could not be surpassed. Any one who
worships one, two, three and out strug
gles could not have asked for better
ball. But those good old drives and
those daring runs on the bases were
entirely lacking in both contests, the
only incidents to arouse enthusiasm
being a few startling bits of fielding.
For eleven long innings neither team
could get better than three hits, which
is surely weak stick work. Fltzpat
rlck, on the Tigers' slab, never pitched
better ball In his life. Inning after in
ning he vied with Henley for the hon
ors. Fitz managed to weather the
storm in the last Inning, a task that
was a shade too hard for the youth to
accomplish. After stowing one man
away in the twelfth, Henley passed
both Eagan and Casey. Lynch blasted
the hopes of the native fans by driving
a zlnger straight out to deep center
field and chasing Eagan Home. Mc-
Laughlin also had one of his old hits
stowed away. In his bat, and when he
unloaded it over second, Casey scam
pered through. Wilson whipped the
ball to second and caught McLaughlin
at that bag. A return throw by Mc-
Kune nailed Lynch at the plate.
Charley Irwln aroused a bit of en
thusiasm by slapping a swift one over
the third sack as a starter for' the
Seals. Wheeler forced him at second.
Terry McKune managed to hit Into a
double play, so the game ended with
the Seals snowballed.
Uncle was forced to play the game
minus the valuable aid of another of
his stars, Joe Nealon. The lad hurt
his arm while swinging at a pitched
ball in the morning game and was com
pelled to act as a spectator. Wlheeler
was stationed at first and played a
swell game of ball. The score:

STORMY SCENES IN THE SOUTH.
I Game Is Called Unexpectedly and
"... Attacks the Umpire i
1 : LOS ANGELES. \ April ~\ IÂ«.â Stormy
i scenes marked the close .r of - to-day's
1 game between Seattle and Los Angeles,
which ended at the end of the seventh
inning with the score of 7 to 2 in favor
of I Seattle. Up to the seventh inning
the game was as prettily. and as evenly
i contested as any : seen on the \ grounds
j this season. ;: Both scored \ a single . run
in the first inning, and there was noth
ing more in â¢ the run column x until :â  the
seventh, when Flood went to third on a
passed ball and scored when a boy-near
the â¢? grand 3 stand Interfered f with V the
ball before the catcher could recover It.
After 1 a \ wrangle V the â > game j proceeded.
In the seventh Umpire Perrine called
Kane safe !in hit ' attempt ito i steal ] sec
ond. Flood, who i was positive he touch
ed the i runner out, engaged ', in a wordy
war with the umpire. After a brief ex
I EDITED BY '
R. A. SMYTH
change Flood made a rush at Perrln*\
but Dillon seized his second baseman
about the waist and prevented the as
sault. Flood struggled to break loose,
and when he saw he could nut reach
the umpire with his hands he kicked at
him, missing his face but a few Inches.
The disturbance on ttoe field set the blÂ»
crowd on edge. Eventually the play
ers resumed their positions. Flood go
ing back to second, but Perrine ordered
him off the grounds. Flood made an
other rush for the umpire and again
was blocked by Dillon's bulky form.
When the game waa resumed the
Angela were nervous and went to
piecees. Baum, who had managed to
keep the hits well scattered up to this
point, lost his cunning and was batted
all over the lot. When Seattle retired
six runs had been tallied. Suddenly
Perrine called the game, much to thÂ«
astonishment of the crowd as well aa
to Manager Morley. Manager Hall of
Seattle picked up the tall, told his
players to grab their bats and all mads
a run for the clubhouse. The crowd
swarmed over the grounds and Mana
ger Morley strenuously protested '
against Perrlne's action. The um
pire declared Hall and Dillon had
agreed to call the game at 4 o'clock in
order to catch the train for the north.
A crowd of excited fans gathered about
the umpire and voiced Its sentiment,
but no attempt was made to strike me
official, who was finally accompanied
by police officers on his way to the car.
Morley made the following statement:
"I told Perrine before the game, and
; he admits it. that no matter how long Â»
It might take the game must be played 5
out. In the face of this he stopped
play at 4 o'clock because, he says. Hall "
and Dillon had agreed to quit at thai .
hour. I shall protest the game." The Â»

OAKLANDS SCORE SHUTOUTS.
Whitewash the Portlands in Two Con.
tests on Idora Park Diamond. ,
; OAKLAND. April,. Captain. JSUp4:Â«
! Van Haltren and his squad of record V
smashers goose-egged Portland's base
ball band twice to-day, making the
' third successive shutout the Oaklands
have inflicted upon the White Sock
Giants within four days.
Ham Iberg was the twister who *
mixed and . spread the whitewash on â¢ '
the Oregonlans â¢ in the morning meet- . ;'
ing, while Oscar Graham befuddled
and keot the big J fellows away from : .
the plate in the afternoon game. Oak
i land scored one run in the perform- .
ance before luncheon and three tallies
in the contest after the midday meal.
... Portland ; harvested _ eight hits from -
Iberg's coquettish .,. deceivers 'â' In the. ,
morning, but Ham permitted no bingles
when bingles would have been j profit- -
able. Iberg won his own game by dis- â¢
patching a long . liner . out to House
holder in the third spasm, thereby giv- .
ing Devereaux, who was on sack three.
a chance to score. In the fifth session "'
Iberg started a terrific. drive for the left . '
field fence., which was plucked from ]
the azure by Van Buren in sensational
style. Jakey Atz found his V batting l
optic to-day and in the morning argu
ment laced out three singles. Port
land left for home to-night, where they .
will open the northern season with the 9
Los Angeles team next week. Score*: ?.-.-

FOOTPADS MAKE
WOMEN VICTIMS
Jennie Smith, a Domestic, Is
Knocked Down and a Purse
Is Snatched From Her Hand
THUG GRABS A SATCHEL
Edward Barron Lured Into
Yard by Two Who Rob
Him at Point of Revolver
Footpads were busy on Saturday
night * and early yesterday morn
ing. Shortly after midnight yesterday
morning Policeman Hinrichs' atten
tion was attracted by the screams of a
woman on Howard street, near Sec
ond. He saw a woman lying on the
sidewalk, and Edward Feran, a ma
rine fireman, running* away from her.
The woman was Jennie Smith, a do
mestic living at 715 Howard street.
She told Hinrichs that Feran had
snatched her purse, containing $3 65.
and knocked her down. Feran had
joined a crowd of men at Second and
Howard streets, where he was ar
rested by Hinrichs and identified by
the woman. The stolen purse was
found on the street near where Feran
had been standing. Feran was booked
for robbery.
While Mrs. H. Albrecht, 1396 Hayes
stree f w r as standing at Devisadero
and McAllister streets on Saturday
night a man about 24 years old
snatched a satchel from her hand and
ran along Devisadero street, toward
Golden Gate avenue. Mrs. Albrecht
screamed and shouted "Stop thief."
Jerome Hurley, a boy living at 1556
Turk street, and a car conductor
gave chase. They were gaining upon
the robber when he stopped and.
turning round, presented a revolver
at them, threatening to shoot if they
followed him. It had the desired ef
fect. The satchel contained $7, a
bunch of keys and some letters and
receipts. The police have a good de
scription of the thief.
Clem Martin, 857 Washington
street, was found asleep by Police
man T. P. Gibbons on the corner of
Clay and East streets early yesterday
morning. When he came to his
senses he told the officer he had been
robbed of a gold watch and fob valued
at $80 and some money. He had been
drinking, and the last place he recol
lected being in was a saloon at Broad
way and Dupont street.
About 11 o'clock Saturday night
Edward Barron, 1217 Market street,
had a fight with his brother
in-law on Folsom street, near Seventh.
Barron's nose was bleeding when he
met two men. They invited him to
go with them to a saloon at 1028 Fol
som street. They would wash the blood
from his face. He went with them,
and when they reached the saloon
one of the men asked the bartender
for a candle. The trio went to the
yard back of the saloon with the
lighted candle. As soon as they if3t
there the candle was extinguished
and one of the men. pointing a re
volver at Barron's head, told him not
to make a noise or he would be
killed. The other searched Barron's
pockets and took $3, all the money
Barron had. Then they led him
through a gate into Russ street and,
again warning him to make no out
cry, disappeared. Barron met Police
men Farrell and Rooney and told
them of his experience. They started
on a hunt and soon came across the
two robbers, who fled. They were pur
sued and one of them, John Powers,
was captured in a saloon at Morris
avenue and Harrison street. A re
volver, which he threw into the front
garden of 115 Harriet street, was re
covered. Powers was booked at the
City Prison for robbery. A search is
being made for his companion.
REVOLUTION IS THEME
OF NOVELEST LONDON
Socialists Hear Author Tell of the
Oppression of Labor by
Capital.
Jack London, the noted author and
student of socialism, addressed a
large gathering at the Alhambra
Theater last night on "Revolution. '"
The address was delivered under the
auspices of the local Socialist Society,
and London's remarks brought forth
rounds of applause, though the speech
was not as flery and stirring as those
generally heard at such assemblages.
London opened his talk by referring
to the American Revolution and the
triumph of the Continental army. He
gradually drifted to the trouble ex
isting in the Russian empire and told
of the way in which the oppressed
there were fighting for their rights
and how they were abused, malterated
and killed by order of powerful Min
isters. When London referred to the
assassination of the officials who had
oppressed the people It was the sig
nal for the first real outbreak of ap
plause.
The speaker gradually forsook his
topic for a long time in order to quote
variouÃ statistics and facts regarding
the condition of labor and capital in
this country to-day. He referred to
the reports of the United States Gov
ernment on these issues, and cited
many Incidents showing how child
labor is belngr used by capitalists for
their own gain, even though thou
sands of lives are sacrificed.
PICNICKERS STUMBLE
OVER BODY OF SUICIPE
Despondent Ex-Soldier Fires Bullet
Into His Brain on Stairway at
Sutro Heights.
Startled by a pistol Bhot a crowd of
sight-seers at Sutro Heights hurriedly
descended the stairs of the observatory
there and found a man lying across the
bottom steps with a revolver clutched
in his hand. He had fired a bullet into
his brain.
An ambulance was summoned and
the man was taken to the Park Emer
gency Hospital, where he died at few
hours later. The man is supposed to
be Frank Fon, an ex-soldier. A hand
kerchief with that name embroidered
upon it. was found in the coat pocket
of a khaki suit he wore.
The man was seen early in the after
noon wandering about the heights in an
aimless fashion. He finally sat down at
the foot of the stairway and brooded
for some time with his head in his
hands. Poverty is supposed to have
been the motive of the deed, as no
money was found on him. The Dick
nickers almost stumbled over the sui
cide as they hurried down the stair
way.

CROSSES LANCE
WITH DR. OSLER
Rev. G. White Characterizes
Medico's Recommendation
as Pagan in Its Nature
MAN GAINS AT SIXTY
Divine Holds That at a
Ripe Age One Attains
to That Which Is Best
Dr. Osier's "half-jest, half-serious"
propaganda as to man's unusefulness
after attaining his sixtieth year was
the theme of- -a sermon by the Rev.
George W. White, D. D., last night At
the Central Methodist Episcopal
Church.
Dr. White said that Dr. Osier's senti
ment was similar to the pagan princi
ples of exposing deformed children and
helpless old people that they might be
put to death by wild beasts. He did
not hesitate to say that to judge of the
worth of life by the years of itÃ physi
cal or material strength was a great
mistake and a pagan principle.
A man who lives as God has planned
finds his later years his best. After the
years of passion and appetite and greed
had passed away, said the speaker, he
really began to live in the best sense.
Dr. White said that the spiritual de
velopment was of the highest value,
and to secure that for his later years a
man must begin in his youth. That
point, he said, gave the force to the
scriptural injunction "To remember thy
Creator in the days of thy youth."
He understood that Dr. Osier had re
marked that what he had said was half
in jest, but his remarks had been taken
seriously by the people of the land,
therefore it was a topic worthy of dis
cussion.
The only standpoint from which such
a conclusion could be reached, said Dr.
White, was the materialistic one, but
from the standpoint of a spiritual life
and spiritual growth the years after 60
were the best in man's life.
DEATH CALLS
A PROMINENT
BUSINESS MAN.
Otis Freeman Willey, a pioneer busi
ness man of this city and widely known
in fraternal circles, passed away at the
home of his sister, Mrs. T. S. Eastman,
on Stockton street yesterday afternoon.
Mr. Willey had ljeen ill for many
months, and his death did not come as
a surprise to his intimate friends.
Mr. Willey was born at Wheelock,
Vt., seventy-seven years ago, and came
to California in the early days. For
many years he conducted one of the
largest carriage and buggy concerns in
the city under the firm name of O. F.
Willey & Co. He was a shrewd business
man and amassed a fortune after his
arrival in San Francisco.
Mr. Willey is survived by a son,
Frank Willey, who was associated in
business with him, and by four sisters
and two brothers, who reside in differ
ent parts of the country. Deceased was
a member of Occidental Lodge of the
Masons and of California Commandery,
Knights Templar. The funeral will take
place on Tuesday from the Masonic
Temple. Interment will be private.
SOON TO BEGIN BUILDING
OF THE, WESTERN PACIFIC
Sixteen Thousand Men to Be Engaged
for Grading at Tills End of
Line.
Sixteen thousand laborers are soon
to be engaged for work on the west
ern end of the survey of the
Western Pacific Railroad, clearing the
way and grading for rails of the new
transcontinental road. This announce
ment is made on the authority of a
representative of Flick & John, well
known Eastern contractors, who is
now in this city awaiting- the arrival
of J. H. Flick. This firm has been
awarded a contract for building a
large portion of the new road between
this city and Salt Lake, and will be
gin operations between San Francisco
and Oroville in about a month.
Flick is now traveling over the
proposed new route south of Oro
ville on horseback and will reach San
Francisco some time this week. A
corps of engineers from' the office of
Flick & John are expected here later,
when arrangements for the employ
ment of labor will be made. Flick
and his partner have been engaged in
some of the big railroad contracting
jobs in the Bast and built the Rock
Island Road between St. Louis and
Kansas City. They are now engaged
in a big piece of railroad work in the
Southwest. Flick has been traveling
westward along the survey of the
Western Pacific for nearly a month,
covering the greater part of 700 miles
in Utah and Nevada on horseback.
He reached Oroville about a week
ago, and after a short rest started
southward toward San Francisco.
MANIAC'S AMBITION IS
TO , RIVAL THE MAFIA
Lunatic Rouses Park Hospital and
Announces That Hs Is on a
Slaughtering Tour.
"I am a bad man," announced a
wild-eyed individual who roused the
inmates of the Park Emergency Hos
pital at 4 o'clock yesterday morning.
'I kill people and cut them in pieces,"
he said. "The Mafia is a prevention of
cruelty to children society to me."
"This is Sunday," soothingly said
Dr. Hill, the surgeon on duty. "It's
against the law to chop people up on
Sunday. Better come inside and* we'll
fix you up."
"No," insisted the wild-eyed visitor.
"I've got to kill some one. I you don't
want me to do it around here I'll go
somewhere else."
Dr. Hill and Steward Moriarity
jumped upon the fellow at the same
time, but he used all his maniac's
strength and eluded them. He jumped
a fence arid disappeared in the di- I
rection of the Sutro forest. The police
are looking for him.
Small Boys Burglarize Cigar Store. '

o'clock yesterday morning and stole
chewing gum and cigarettes to the
value of $16 45. Policeman Hinrichs

ing gum and cigarettes was found.
The lad admitted boing one of the trio
thaf robbed the cigar store and said
his companions were "Red" Rooney,
who lives near Fourth and Bryant
streets, and "Sharkey," whose address
he did not know. Cullen was booked
ton a charge of burgle rv and sent to
the Detention Home.
MORRIS LEVY
IS INDIGNANT
Hayes Valley Club Manager
Declares His Organization
Has Genuine Membership
CAN SHOW THE RECORDS
Magnate Will Overwhelm
the Supervisors With Lit
erature to Convince Them \
Morris Levy is busy these days :
hauling the archives of the Hayes
Valley Athletic Club out of the lav
ender-scented trunks in the garret- ,
Morris has the dope, the real dope, he j
asserts, to prove that the Hayes Val
ley Athletic Club is a bona fide, simon
pure 18-karat amateur association.
"Me bribe a Supervisor?" exclaimed
the dapper manager with a look of
pained siypVise in his countenance.
4 Quit your kidding. The Supervisors I
and everybody else in this burg know
that I am on the square."
Levy has sorted out over 200 appli- !
cations for membership in his club.
All sorts of professions are on the list, |
from barbers to capitalists.
"Why, mine is the Only club that !
is a club," he declared. "If they want
to find something shady in the boxing
line, there may be a chance, but not
with the Hayes Valley Club."
The subject of medals that could
be converted into real money was
broached.
"We only give medals," said Morris,
"and we don't redeem them even at a
discount. Hereafter I am going to ;
have the boys stick up their trophies
in some cigar store, where they can be
seen.
"We're going tp have a show pretty I
soon," he continued, "and Sam Berger
is going to box for a medal â just a
plain medal. No, I'm not trying to I
string you. You listen to me. Sam |
Berger is going to box for a medal,
and that's all he will get, too."
The Hayes Valley manager has
enough documentary evidence to stock
a library. He will charter a few ex
press wagons to-day and cart all the
literature accumulated by the club to
the Supervisors. There is enough of
it to make them throw up their hands.
Morris blames some of his troubles
to Eddie Graney. The village black
smith has been giving dissertations on
amateur prizefights to the Grand
Jury. \ 'I suppose he tried to knock
me," remarked Levy. "But he has
nothing on me. I am on the square.
"The Hayes Valley Athletic Club is
a bona fide club. We have a club
house in Mowry's Hall and a boxing
annex at Woodward's Pavilion. If the
Grand Jury is looking for phoney
clubs they can find them easily
enough."

Lady Attired In Brown Dress.
Coat and Veil.
There were a number of excited
maids and matrons in Zobel's mil

She took her hat off to try on some
of the new creations in millinery and
placed her hand bag under the old
hat on a table. After her taste had
t-'been satisfied she lifted up the old
. hat to get the hand bag. when, -to her
amazement, she discovered that it had
: disappeared.
She at once made the theft known,
and as the store was crowded the
news spread and created excitement.
One of the saleswomen said she had
observed a tall young lady attired
in a brown dress, long brown coat and
; wearing a brown veil hovering near
1 the table. As she had left the store
; without making any purchase sus
i picion fell upon her. The police were
