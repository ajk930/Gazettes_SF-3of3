(SECOND LESSON NEXT SUNDAY.)
you will be ready for next week's lesson.
Memorize the letters also, so that instinctively here
after you v.-ill recall what letters or keys make up the various
chords.
A knowledge of the chords of keys In which music is com
posed la the foundation stone for future skill in reading- music
fluently.
These charts have floured out for you all these chorda. AH that
you have to do i3 learn them.
You will find after learning: them that you will be able to play
raxy and simple accompaniments to the melodies you or your
friends sing.
This will be a constant source of amusement and delight to
you.
If you are more ambitious than that, and wish to so further,
you will find you have begun right, and the rest will be com
paratively easy.
The teacher of music will at once see that in these charts both
the minor harmonic scale and the major scale are shown with
proper signature and fingering.
Again, what Is needed most are patience and practice.
Every triad in red letters
is marked 1. 3. 5. Always
read triads 1. 3. 5. no mat
ter what position. Triad of

position, 3. the highest;
read Â£ <? and so with
every triad major ox minor.
Place this chart at risht
angles to the keyboard of your
piano or organ, so that the
small black D on the bottom
space of the chart touches the
white key D on the keyboard.
The other white spaces on the
chart will then be aver ' the

FIRST LESSON.
GROVE'S MUSIC SIMPLIFIED
W. SCOTT GROVE,
SCRANTON, PA.
THE SUNDAY CALL'S FREE PIANO LESSONSthe junction with the main road. Hap
pily the last, owing to the lay of the
ground, were out of sight from Grant
ley Imason's windows, \ no less than
from the village itself.
"And that'j? the home of the fairy
princess?" asked Courtland as they
passed Old Myi House, a rambling,
rather broken-down old place, covered
with creepers.
"Yes; she and her brother moved
there when the old rector died. You
may have heard of himâ the Chidding
fold who was an authority on Milton.
No ? Well, he was, anyhow. Rather
learned all round, I fancy â fellow of
John's. But he took .this living and
settled down for life; and when he died
the children were turned out of the
rectory and took Old Mill House.
They've got an old womanâ well, she's
not very oldâ with the uneuphonious
name of Mumple living with them.'
She's been a sort of nurse-housekeeper
compahlon: a mixed kind of position â
breakfast and midday dinner with the
family, but didn't join his reverence's
evening, meal. . You know the sort of
thing. She's monstrously fat, but Si
bylla loves her. And the new rector
moved a fortnight ago, and everybody
hates him. And the temporary curate,
who was here because the new rector
was at Bournemouth for his health,
and who lodged over the postomce, has
just gone, and everj'body's dashed glad
to cee the last of him. And that's all
the news of the town. And, behold,
Tom, I'm the squire of it, and every
man, woman, or child In It Is, by un
broken tradition and custom, entitled to
have as much port wine out of my cel
lar as his. her, or its state of health
may happen to require."
He threw off this chatter in a gay,
self-contented fashion, and Tpm Court
land looked at him with affectionate
envy. The world had been very good to
him, and he, in return, was always
amiable to it. He had been born heir
and only child of his father; had Inher
ited the largest share ln a solid, old
fashioned banking-house; was now a
director of the great joint stdck under
taking in which the family business
had consented to merge itself on hand
some terms: had just as much. work, to
do as he liked, and possessed, and al
ways had enjoyed, more money than he
needed. He was 33 now, and had been
a social favorite even before he left
school. If it was difficult to say what
positive gain bis existence had been to
society, there was no doubt that his
extinction would at any time have been
considered a distinct loss.
, "A country squire with a rosy
cheeked country girl for wife! That's
a funny ending for you, Grantley."
"She's not rosy-cheekedâ and, it's not
an ending â and there's 'the postomce.
Go ln and be as civil as you can to
Lady Harriet"
A smile of pity, unmistakably
mingled with contempt, followed Court
land into the shop. The tantrums of
other ! men's wives are generally re
ceived with much the same mixture of
skepticism and disdain as the witti
cisms of other parents' children. Both
are seen large, very large Indeed, by
sufferers and admirers respectively.-
The -obligation of being as civil as"
he could to his wife caused Courtland
to take three or four minutes in fram
ing his telegram, and when he came out
ho found Grantley seated on the bench
that stood by the inn and conversing
with a young .man who wore a very
old coat and rough tweed knicker
bockers. Grantley introduced him as
Jeremy Chiddingfold, and Courtland
knew that he was Sibylla's j brother-
Sibylla herself he had not yet, seen.
Jeremy had a Eho.ck of sandy hajr, a
wide brow and a wide mouth; his eyes
were rather protuberant and. bis. nose
turned up, giving promlneiu!se 1 'to the
nostrils. .
"No family likeness, I hope?" Court
land found himself' thinking; for
though Jeremy was a vigorous,- if ; not
a handsome, masculine type, the Jlnes.
were far from being those of feminine
beauty. ; : '-Â¦ ;
"And he's enormously surprised; and'
evidently. -rather shocked -to hear I'm .
going to marry hjs sisterâ roh, we can
talk away, Jeremy; Tom Courtland
doesn't matter. He knows all the bad:
there is about me and wants to know;
all the good there is about Sibylla." '
One additional auditor by no means
embarrassed Jeremy; perhaps not a
hundred would have.
"Though, of course, somebody must
have married her, you know," Grantley
went on, smiling and stretching himself
luxuriously like a sleek indolent cat.
"I hate marriage altogether!" de
clared Jeremy. Â¦
Courtland turned to. him with a quick
jerk of his head. ' . V '
"The deuce you do!" he said, laugh-
Ing. "It's early In life to have come
to that conclusion, Mr. Chiddingfold."
"Yes, yes, Jeremy, quite so; butâ"
Grantley began.
"It's an invention of priests," Jeremy
insisted heatedly. *
Courtland, scarred with fifteen years'
experience of " the institution Â¦.- thus
roundly attacked, . was immensely di
verted, though his own feelings gave
a rather bitter twist to his ; mirth.
Grantley ' argued, or rather , pleaded,
with a deceptive gravity: . : :: â¢
"Bu^ if yÂ° u * al * ln lÂ° ve with a girl?','
"Heaven forbid! 1 ; - ~ ;â? 'â¢ â¢ â¢ -'\ ; -
"Well, but the world must';be peo
pled, Jeremy." , Â¥$]& -
"Marriage Isn't necessary tot that, Is
it?"- . Â¦ ' . Â¦''Â¦:'Â¦. Â¦ . ./--Â¦*--â¢Â¦: ' :".â¢Â¦
"Oho!" whistled, Courtland; '.
"We may concede the*" point â in
theory," said Grantley; "ln'practlce It's
more difficult." ,* * _-â¢>"
"Because- people won't think clearly
and bravely!" ; cried Jeremy, ; with a
thump on' the '.-bench. "Because they're
hidebound, and; as I say, the priests
heaven-and-hell them till they don't
know where they: are." .- -- .-â¢.-:â¢. .'..
"Heaven-and-hell them! Good phrase,
Jeremy! You ; speak . feelingly. Your
father, perhapsâ? Oh, excuse me, I'm
one of the family now." : , . â¢â¢' .
"My father? Not. a bit. Old' :- Mumples
now, if you like. : However . that's , got
nothing to do .with it. " I'm going 'on
the lines of pure reason. And what is
pure reason?" 'â¢". . :
The elder men looked at one another,
smiled and shook their heads.
"We don't know; it's no use pretend
ing we do. You tell us, Jeremy," said
Grantley.
. Â¦ "It's just nature â natureânature!
Get back to that, and you're on solid
ground. Why, apart from anything
else, how can you expect marriage,
a3 we have It, to succeed when women
are what they are? And haven't they
always been the same? Of course
they have. Read history, read fiction
(though it isn't worth- reading), read
science, and look at the worjd round
about you."
He waved his arm extensively, tak
ing in much more than the valley In
which most of his short life had been
spent.
"If I'd thought as you do at your
age," said. Courtland, "I should have
kept out of a lot of trouble."
"And I should have kept out of a
lot of scrapes," added Grantley..
"Of course you would!" snapped
Jeremy.
That point heeded no elaboration.
"But surely there are exceptions
among women, Jeremy?" Grantley
pursued appeallngly. ."Consider, my
position!"
"What is man?" demanded Jeremy.
"Well, let me recommend you to read
Haeckel!"
"Never mind man. . Tell us more
about woman," urged Grantley. i
"Oh, lord, I suppose you're thinking
of- Sibylla?"
,"I own f * it,",, murmured : Grantley.
"You kndw her so well, you see." ,
Descending from the heights of
scientific generalization and from the
search after that definition of man for
which he had been In the end obliged
to refer his listeners to another au
thority, Jeremy lost at the same time
his gravity, and vehemence. He sur
prised ' Courtland | by' showing himself
owner of, a humorous and attractive
smile.
"You'd' rather define man, perhaps,
than Sibylla?" suggested Grantley.
"Sibylla's, all right, If you know to
manageher." : ,, Â¦â¢/Â¦ Â¦â¢ Â¦ !
"Just "what old Lady Trederwyn
used to say r to me about Harriet,"
Courtland .whispered to Grantley.
"But it needs a bit of knowing." She's
got the ; deuced of a , temperâ old Mum
ples knows : that* ,* Well, Mumples has
got a temper, too.: They, used to have
awful * rows â do : still, now and <" then."
Sibylla used to fly out at Mumples,
"Wouldn't it have been better to have
a preceptress of more equable temper?"
asked Grantley.
"Oh, there's nothing really wrong
with Mumples; we're both awfully
fond of her. Besides she's had such
beastly hard luck. Hasn't Sibylla told
you about that, Imason?"
"No, i nothing.' â¢
"Her husband was .sent to quod, you
know â got twenty years.
t "Twenty years! By Jingo!"
"Yes; He tried to murder a manâ a
man who i had .swindled him. Mumples
says he , did it all in a passion; but it
seems to have been a cold sort of pas
sion,' because he " waited twelve hours
for. him before he knifed him. And at
"Not content with a quiet conscious
ness of rectitude, as a man would
be?"
"Consciousness of rectitude? Lord,
it. wasn't that! That would have been
all right It was just the other way
round. They both knew they had
tempers, and Mumples is infernally re
ligious and Sibylla's generous to the
point of idiocy In my opinion. So
after a row, when Sibylla had cheeked
Mumples and told her to go to the
devil (so' to speak), and Mumples had
sent her to bed or thumped her, or
something, you know "
"Let. us not go too deep into family
tragedies, Jeremy."
"Why, when it had all settled down,
and the governor and I could hear
ourselves talking quietly again " .
"About marriage and that sort of
question?"
"They, began to have conscience.
Each would have it borne in on her
that she was wrong. Sibylla generally
started it. She'd go weeping, to Mum
plea,' taking all her own 'things and
any. of mine that were lying about
handy, and laying them at, Mumples'
feet, and saying she was the wickedest
girl alive, and why hadn't Mumples
pitched into her a lot more, and that
she really loved Mumples better than
anything on earth. Then Mumples
would weigh in and call Sibylla the
sweetest and meekest lamb on earth,
and say that she loved Sibylla more
than anything on earth, and that she â
Mumples â was the worst tempered and
ellest and unjustest woman alive, not
fit to be near such an angel as Sibylla.
Then Sibylla used to say that was rot,
and Mumples said it wasn't. And Si
bylla declared Mumples only said it to
wound her, and Mumples got hurt be
cause Sibylla wouldn't forgive her,
when Sibylla, of course, wanted Mum
ples to forgive her. And after half an
hour of that sort of thing It was as
likely as not that they'd have quar
reled worse than ever, and the whole
row would begin over again." *
. Grantley lay back and laughed.
"A bit rough on you - to give your
things" toâ er â Mumples V suggested
Courtland. .
"Just like Sibyllaâ just , like any
woman, I expect," opined Jeremy, but
with a more resigned and better tem
pered air. His reminiscences had evi
dently amused himself as well as his
listeners. -
then Mumples sat on Sibylla, and then,
when it was all over, they'd generally
have a new and Independent row about
which had been right and which wrong
in the. old row."
Grantley laughed easily. "My poor
old chap, you can't be expected to taka
a cheerful view. Poor old Tom! God
bless you, old chap! Let's go home to
tea."
As they walked by the parsonage a
bicycle came whizzing - through the
open garden gate. It was propelled by
a girl of fifteen or thereaboutsâ a slim,
long-legged child, almost gaunt in her
immaturity and lamentably grown out
of her frock. She cried shrill greeting
to Grantley and went off down the
street, displaying her skill to whoso
ever would look by riding with her
arms akimbo.
"Another local celebrity," said Grant
ley. "Dora Hutting, the new parson's
daughter. That she should have come
to live In the village Is a gross personal
affront to Jeremy Chiddingfold.* He's
especially Incensed by her lengthy
stretch of black stockings, always, i aa
he maintains, with a hole in- them."
Courtland laughed inattentively.
"I hope Harriet'll get that wire in
good time," he said.
No remark came into Grantley's
mind, unless it were to tell his friend
that he was a fool to stand what he
did from tho woman. But what was
, Jeremy nodded gravely. He was
not susceptible to ridicule on the sub
ject of his theories. The two watched
him stride away \ toward Old Mill
House with decisive, vigorous steps.
"Rum product for a country par
sonage, Grantley."
"Oh, he's not a product; he's only
an embryo. .But I think he's a prom
ising one and he's richly amusing."
"Yes, and I wonder how you're going
to manage Miss Sibylla!"
the trial he couldn't even prove tha
swindling:, so he. got it pretty hot."
"No, he's alive. He's to get out hi
about three years. Mumples is waiting
for him." . â¢
"Poor old woman! Does she go and
see him?"
1 "She used to. She hasn't for ream
now. I believe he won't have barâ I
don't know why. The governor w*Â»
High Sheriff's chaplain at the tlma, so
he got to know Mumples and took Ker
on. She's been with us ever since and
she can stay as long as she likes."
"What things one comes across 1 M
sighed Tom Courtland.
Grantley had looked grarÂ© for &
moment, but he. smiled again as he
said:
"After all, though, you've not told
me how to manage Sibylla. I'm not
Mumples â I can't thump her. I should
be better than Mumples in one way,
though. If I did, I should be dead sura
to stick to it that I was right"
"You'd stick to it even if you didnt
think so," observed Courtland.
. For a moment the remark seemed to
vex Grantley, and to sober him. He
spent a few seconds evidently reflect
ing on it.
* "Well, I hope not," he said at last.
"But at any rate I should think ao
generally."
"Then you could mostly maka her
think so. But if it wasn't true you
might feel a brute."
"So I might, Jeremy."
"And it mightn't be permanently
safe. She sees things uncommonly
sharp sometimes. Well, I must be off."
"Going back to Haeckel?"
"Oh, needn't I?" grumbled Courtland.
He was a rather short, sturdily built
man, with a high color and stiff black
hair which stood up on his head. His
face was not wanting in character,
but a look of plaintive worry beset it.
"You try living in the same house with
a womanâ with a woman like that, I
mean!" ,
"Thanks for the explanation,"
laughed Grantley.
"I znust go and wire when I shall be
back, cr Harriet'll blow the roof off
over that. You come, too; a etroll'll do
you good."
Grantley Imason agreed; and the two,
leaving the garden by a little side gate,
took their vvay along the . steep road
which led down to the village, and rose
again on the other. Bide of it, to join
the main highway across the flowna. a
mile and a half away. The lane was
narrow, steep and full of turns; the no
tice "Dangerous to Cyclitts" gave
warning of its character. At the foot
of it stood the Old Mlii House, backing
on to a little stream. Farther on lay
the church and the parsonage: oppo
site to them was the postofSce. which
was also a general shop and also had
rooms to let to visitors. The village inn
next to the postofSce. and" a dorcn or so
of laborers' cottages exhausted the
shelter of the little valley, though the
parish embraced .several homesteads
scattered about in dips of the downs,

"Yes, you would look an ass," Grant
ley agreed. "Doesn't Bhe give youâ
well, any other chance, you know?"
"Not she! My dear fellow, she's
most aggressively the other way."
"Then why don't you give her a
chance?"
"What, you mean ?"
"Am I so very cryptic?" murmured
Grantley, as he lit his pipe/
"I'm a Member of Parliament."
"Yes, 1 forgot. That's a bit awk
ward."
"Besides, there are the children. . I
don't want my children to think their
father a scoundrel." He paused" and
added grimly: "And I don't want them
to be left to their mother's bringing up,
either."
"Then we seem to have exhausted
the resources of the law."
"The children complicate it so. Walt
till you have some of your own,
Grantley."
"Look here â steady!" Grantley ex
postulated. "Don't be in such a hurry
to give me domestic incumbrances. The
bloom's still on my romance, old chap.
Talking of children to a man who's
only been engaged a week!" His* man
ner resumed its air of languid sympa
thy as he went on: "You needn't see
much of her, Tom, need you?"
Grantley sighed again as he searched
for his tobacco pouch. The eigh seemed
to hover doubtfully between a faint
eympathy and a resigned boredom.
"And no end to Uâ none in sight! I
don't know whether lt*8 legal cruelty

"But v.bat an ass I should look If I

?â¢Stay a bit longer, old chap," urged
his host, Grantley Imason, who lay full
length on his back on the turf, with a
straw hat over his eyes and nose, and
a pipe, Jong gone out, between his
teeth.
"'Back to my wife!" Courtland went
on, without noticing the invitatioo.
With a faint Eigh Grantley Imason
sat up. put his hat on his head, and
knocked out his pipe. He glanced at his
friend with a look of satirical amuse
ment.
"You're encouraging company for a
man who's just got engaged," he re
marked.
"It's the devil of a business â sort of
thing some of those fellows would
write a book about. But it's not worth
a book. A page of strong and indis
criminate swearingâ that's what it's
worth, Grantley." .
The houseâ a large, plain, white
building with no architectural preten
sionsâstood on a high swell of the*
downs and looked across the valley in
vhich Milldean village lay. and thence
ever rolling stretches of close turf, till
the prospect ended in the gleam of
waves and the silver gray mist that
lay ovf-r the sea. It was a fine, open,
free view. The air was fresh, with a
touch of salt in it, and made the heat
of the sun more than endurable â even
welcome and nourishing. Tom Court
land, raising himself from the grass
end sitting up straight, gave utterance
to what his surroundings declared to
be a very natural exclamation:
"What a bore to leave this and go
back to town!" . â¢

Mrs. Raymore when she had finished
reading, "and he says a good deal
Courtland went off early next morn
tlon â no railway line ran nearer Mill
dean â and Grantley Imason spent the
morning lounging about his house,
planning what improvements could be
made and what embellishments pro
vided against the coming of Sibylla.
He enjoyed this pottering both for Its
own sake and because it was connected
with the thought of the girl he loved.
Tor he was in loveâ as much in love.
It seemed to him. as a man could well
be. "And I ought to know," he said,
with a smile of reminiscence, his mind
going back to earlier affairs of the
heart, more or leas serious, which had
been by no mean lacking In his career.
He surveyed tl 'm without remorse,
though one or two might reasonably
have evoked that emotion, and with
no more regret than lay In confessing
that he had shared the follies common
to his age and his position. - But he
found great satisfaction in the thought
that Sibylla had had nothing to do
with any of the persons- concerned.
She had known none of them; she was
Id no sense of the same set with any
one of the five or six women of whom
he was thinking; her surroundings had
always been quite different from theirs.
She came into his life something en
tirely fresh, new, and unconnected
with the past. Herein lay a great deal
of the charm of this latest, this final
affair. For It was to be finalâ for his
love's sake, for his honor's sake, and
also because it seemed time for such
finality in that ordered view of life and
its stages to which his Intellect in
clined him. There was something
singularly fortuf ate in the Â¦ chance
which enabled him to suit his desire
to this conception, to . find the two
things in perfect .harmony, to act on
rational lines with such a full and
even eager assent of his feelings.
He reminded himself, with his fa
vorite shrug, that to talk of chance
was to fall into an old fallacy; but
the sense of accident remained. The
thing hnd been so entirely unplanned.
He had meant to buy a place in the
north; it was only when the one- he
wanted had been snapped up â¢ by
somebody else that the agents suc
ceeded in persuading him to coma
and look at the house at Milldean. It
happened to take his fancy and he
bought 't. Then he happened to be
out of sorts and stayed down there an
unbroken month, instead of comins
only from Saturday to Monday. Again,
Sibylla and Jeremy had meant
to go awav when the rector died, and
had stayed on only because Old Mill
Houso happened to fall vacant so
opportunely. No other house was
available in the village. So the
chances went on, till chance cul
minated in that meeting" of hia with
Sibyllaâ not their first encounter, but
the one; he always called his meetins
with her in hia own thoughts â that
wonderful evenins when all the sky
was red. and the earth, too, looked
almost red, and the air was ao still.
Then ho had been with her In hia
garden, and she, forgetful of him.
had turned her eyes to the heavens
and gazed and gazed. Presently, and
still, as it seemed, unconsciously, she
had stretched out her hand and
caught his in a tisrht crip, silently
but urgently demanding hia sympathy
for thoughts and feelings she could
not express. At that moment her
beauty seemed to be born for him,
and he had determined to maka it his.
He smiled now, saying: that ha had
been as Impulsive aa the merest boy.
thanking fortune that hÂ« could re
joice In the Impulse instead of con
demning it â an end which a priori
Â¦would have seemed much ths more
probable. In nine cases out of tÂ«n It
would have been foolish and disas
trous to be carried away ha an instant
like that. In his case it had. at any
rate, not proved disastrous. From,
that moment he had nerer turned
back from his purpose, and h* had
nothing but satisfaction ln Its . now
imminent accomplishment.
"Absolutely the right thing! I eouMnt
have dome better for myself."
He stood alone in the mlddJa of the
room and said these words aloud.
They exhausted the . subject, and
Grantley sat down at his Â¦writing
table to answer Mrs. Raymore's lat
ter of congratulation. Ha had never
been In love with Mrs. Raymore. who
wan his senior by ten years; but she
was an old and intimate frianxSâ â¢
â perhaps hia most intimate friend.
She had been more or lesa In hia
confidence while he was wooing
Sibylla, and a telegram apprising her
of his success had called forth the
letter to which he now owed a re
sponse.
"If 1 had been a poor man." hÂ»
wrote- in -the course of his reply. "I
wouldn't have married â least of all a
rich wife. Even as a well-to-do man
I wouldn't have married a rich wife.
You have to marry too much besides
the woman! And I didn't want a
society woman, nor anybody from any
of the sets I've knocked about with.
But I did want to marry. I want a
wife, and I want the dynasty con
tinued. It's come direct from father
to eon for five or six generations, and
I didn't want to stand on record 'as
the man who stopped It. I'm entirely
contented, no lesa with the project
than with the lady. It will complete
my life. That's what I want â a com
pletion, not a transformation. She'll
do just this for me. If I had taken a
child and trained her, I couldn't have
got more exactly what I want; and
I'm sure you'll think so to when you
come to know her. Incidentally I ac
quire a delightful brother-in-law.
He'll always be a capital fellow,
but. alas, he won't long be the jewel
he is now; Just at that stage between
boy and man â hobbledehoy, as you
women used to make me so furious by
calling me â breathing fury against all
institutions. . especially those common>
ly supposed to be of divine origin;
learned In ten thousand books; know-
Ing naught of all that falls under the
categories of men. women and things;
best of all, blindlv wrath at himself
because he has become, or is becom
ing a man nnd can't help It and can't
help feelinjc it! How he hates women
and despises them! You see. he has
begun to be afraM! I haven't told
him that he's begun to be afraid: tt
will be rich to watch him as he
achieves the discovery on his own ac
count. You'll enjoy him very much."
Grantley ended his letter with a
warm tribute to Mrs. Raymore's
friendship, assurances of all it had
been to him and a promise that mar
riage should, so far a3 his feelings
went, in no way lessen. Impair or al
ter the affection between them.

about th.e brother-in-law and quite a
let aboot himself. But really, be says
hardly one word about Sibylla!" No-w
it was, of course, about Sibylla that
Htm. Rayn-.cre bad wanted to bear.
Late afternoon found Grantley can
tering over the downs toward Fair
haven. Sibylla had been staying the
night there with a Mrs. Valentine, a
friend cf hers, and tv-as to return by
the omnibus which plied to and from
Miildean. Their plan was that he
should meet her and she should dis
mount, leaving her Iu^^age to fre de
livered. He loved his horse and had
seized the opportunity of slipping in
a ride. When she joined him h-t
would get eff and walk with her. As
he rode bow he v/as not in the cairn
mood which had dictated his letter.
Ke was excited and eagtr at the pros
jxct of sieeting- Sibylla again; he was
exulting in the success of his love, in
stead cf contemplating with satisfac
tion thÂ» orderly progression of his
life. But he had not, and he knew
hÂ«> had not, quite the freedom from
self -consciousness which marks a
youthful passion. The eagemess was
there, but he wns not surprised, al
though he waa gratified to find it
tiiert. His ardor was natural enough,
to need no nursing, yet Grantley was
inclined to caxess it- Ke Laughed aa
he let his horse stretch himself in a
?a.ilop; he was delighted and a trifie
amused to find his emotions so fresh;
none of tbe luxury, none of the pleas
ure giving power had gone out of
then. Ke was stiil as good a lover
as i=v man.
He was wintering over the turf
thirty or forty yards from the roud
when tbe omnibus passed him. The
driver cried his nasne and pointed
back with his whip. Grantley 'saw
ifibylla a long way behind. Ke touch
ed his horse with the Bptxr and gal
loped toward her. Now she stood stiil
waStfas (or him. He came up to her
at full speed. r*ined in and leaped off.
Holding his trial* and his hat in cm
hiLnd. with the other he took hers
and. bowinar over it, kissed it. His
Â¦whole approach was gallantly con
ceived and carried cut.
"Ah. you â you come to me like Sir
Galahad!" murmured Sibylla.
-My dear. Sir Galahad: A banker

"Weil. .*o bankers kirs tbÂ« banis of

'"B^nk-rs of IovÂ« would kiss the

Now and then be cried something

falling in stress. But he did not stop.

said; and added In a whisper: "Good

He walked his horse up ths hill,
leaking back once or twice to the gate
where she stood watching him till a
turn of the lane hid him from her
sight. When that happened, he sighed
in luxurious contentment, and took a
cigarette from his case.

"Is it so complicated as that?

She broke into a fresh laugh, a

"Nov I don't want to think it over.

He gave her bis band; any warmer
fareseell there in the village street was
<;uite against his ways and notions.
He observed a questioning look in her
eyes, bat It did not occur to him that
she was rather surprised at his want

She did not propose to spend any time
with Jeremy.
"Can we always b<? careering ov?r

asked her in affectionate mockery.
She looked up at him. answering
simply:
"Why not?"
He shook his head with a whimsical
imiie.
"Whatever else there i3, our hearts
can bÂ« riding together still."
"And when we're old folks? Isn't it
only the young who can ride like
that?**
She steed silent for e moment or
two. Then she turned her eyes up to
bis in silence still, with the color shin-
Ing bright on her cheeks. She took
his hand and kissed it. Ke knew the
thought that his words had called into
h-r mind. He had made the girl think
that, when they were old, the world
would not be; there would be young
hearts still to ride, young hearts *in
whom their hearts should be carried
stiil tn the glorious gallop, young
hearts which had drawn life from
them.
They parted at the gate of Old
Mill House. Grantley urged her to
come up to his house in the evening
and bring Jeremy with her. and
laughed again when she said: "Bring
Jeremy?" She was confused at the
bint in his laughter, but she laughed
too. Then growing grave, she went
ca:
Graniiey laughed in sheer enjoyment
of her. Amusement rningied with hia
admiration. His balance had quite
come back , to him. A review of the
afternoon, of their wild ride, made him
give part of his amusement to his owa
share in the proceedings. But who es
pects a man. or need expect himself, to
be wise when he ts in love? If there be
a chartered season *or sweet folly, it ir

They came to the crest of th* hill

"Yes, a great thins to look back on.

She waved her hand toward ilill

It waa her Â« him. urged -with the
mc-ck impenousness of a petted slave,
that he should mount again, and she
walked fcy his horse. Thus they
trended iheir vray hunie through the
peace of the evening. She talked now
of how he bad first come into her life.
cf bow she had begun, to â She hesi
tated, ending-. THow I be?an first
to feel you â ** and of how, little

was \vcr:der*ully open and simple
very direct and unabashed; yet there
was nothing that eren his fastidious
and E3uch-testeÂ«i taste found indelicate
or even forward. In glad confidence she
tcld all, careless of keeping- any secrets
or any defenses against him. The seed
had iraickened in virgin soil, and ths
fiower had sprung up in a nightâal
rr.cst by magic, she seemed to fancy.
He listened tenderly and indulgently.
The name cf his emotion had burnt
down, but there was an afterglow
Â¦which made him delightfully content
with her. interested and delighted ia
her. still more thoroughly satisfied with
What he had done, even more glad that
she Â¦a'as different fr-"m all the others
with whom he had been thrown. While
she displayed to him at once the joy
and the spontaneity of her abandon
ment of her whole existence and self
to him. she made him surer of his wis
dom in taking her and all she offered,
more convinced of the excellence of
this disposition of his life. She could
give him all he pictured as desirable â
the stretches cf tranquillity, the mo
menta of szrons feeling. She had it in
her to give both, and she Trould ail
she had to give. In return h* gave her
his love. No analysis seemed needful
there. He gav* her the love of his
heart and the shelter cf his arm; what
more be couid give her ths afternoon
had shown. But in the end it waa all
contained and summed up in a word â
he g-ave his lave.
He swung himself off his horse, and
the ready smiie can;e to his face.
"I hope rou'll find tht necessity a
permanent one," be said.
!?he too laughe<i joyfully as she sub
mitted to his kiss.
He was in a ni/mentary reaction of
feeling; his earnestness was almost
somber as he answered:
"God grant you're doing right !"
"I'm doin^ what I must do, Grant
ley." Â§
She showed him her face. Her eyes
were full of tears: there was a deep
glow en her cheeks, generally so pale.
She sprang to her feet and stood by
hia horse, looking up at him.
'I angry? YÂ«-u rough? It has been
more than I knew happiness could be.
I had" no idea joy could be like that,
no idea life had anything like that.
And you ask me if I am angry and if

'"Yc-u're not angry with me?" he
said. "I wasn't rough to you? I
couldn't bear to stop at first."
and forward to bis side. He held her
thus with bis arm. exulting in the
struggle of his muscles. He held her
close against him and kissed her face.
When he let her go and she reached
earth, she sank on the ground and
covered her face with both bands, all
her body shaken with her gasps. He
rat on his horse for a moment, look
ing at her. He drew a deep inspira

that there seemed now little win(JÂ».

Jeremy bad asked no questions as to
the probable nattire <jt Court land's

with the ether recollections of the
evening, with Mrs. Munajie's story aa<i
the turn they had given to it. with
Grantley's anecdote about himself, and
with the idea of him whicli Jererti's

how Mrs. Mumple herself read tie case.
"Quit a romantic picture: Tee lady

For a girl of ardent temper and
vivid imagination, strung to her high
est pitch by a wonderful fairy ride
and the still strange emDrace of her
lever, It may fairly be reckoned a
trial to listen to a detailed comparison
of the hero of her fancy with another
individual, who has been sentenced to
twenty years' penal servitude for at
tempted murder! Concede circum

point in his sister's spiritual panoply.
He regarded Sibylla's ill repressed ir

with a smile of malicious humor!
"You mi?ht almost as well come up
to Imason's," he whiskered.
"She cn.n't go on much longer!"

"Quite a few thousand years ago
there was no difference between a foot

Sibylla got up and walked to the
window. From It the lights in Grant

Mrs. JIumple went on; "anoT you've

Sibylla broke Into a laagh. Jeremy
relit his pipe with a secret smile.
"But I do call It fine of MumDles."
"Go and tell her you've never dona

"I'm going up to Imason's now. so you
can have it all to yourselves."
"I don't want to cry to-night."
Sibylla objected, with a plain hint cf
mysterious causes for triumph.
Jeremy picked up his cap. showing a
studious disregard of any such indi
cations.
"You're going up the hill now 7 I
shall sit up for you."
"You'll sit up for me?"
"Yes. Besides. I don't feel at all
sleepy to-night."
"I shall when I come back."
"I shan't want to talk."
"Then what will you want? Why are
you going to sit up?"
"I've* ever so many things to do."
Jeremy's air was weary as he turned
away from the inscrutable feminine.

he could. A man met men there.

Grantley looked at bins, smiling.
' "I don't rough it unless I'm obllged.

She paused and stitched at her work
for a minute or two.
"You must leave men alone some
times." she said.
"But, Mumples, you?" whispered
Sibylla.
Mrs. Mumple looked 'up at her, but
made no answer. Jeremy flung down
his book with an impatient air; he re
sented the approaches of emotion â es
pecially in himself.
"He'll be old when he comes out â

But Jeremy welcomed a diversion.
"Rot!** be said. "It's only because

Mrs. Mumple had risen In the midst
of eulogizing the Improvement of her
temper, and now passed by Jeremy,
patting his unwilling cheek. She went
out. and the next moment was heard in
vigorous altercation with their servant
as to the defects of certain exes.

Sibylla. "
"Bosh!" ejaculated Jeremy curtly.
"He liked ; them good-looking, to

A reference to this date was always
the signal for a kiss from Sibylla. She
rendered the tribute and returned to
her chair, sighing . desperately. But
it was some relief that Mrs. Mumole
had finished her parallel, with its list
of ideal virtues, and now left Grant

of his absence (that was the term eu
phemistically employed). The ashes
of their interest suddenly flickered up
at the hint of a qualification which
Mrs./ Muznple unexpectedly intro
duced.
"He wasn't the husband for every

"Thank heave nt" muttered Jeremy,

of comfort lovingly pursued, a comfort
which lay not In g-orgeocsness or In
mere expenditure, but in the delicate
adjustment of means to ends and a
careful exclusion of anything likely to
disturb a dexterously achieved
equipoise. Though Jeremy admired the
absence of emotion, his rough vigorous
nature was challenged at another point.
Ke felt a touch of scorn that a man
should take so much trouble to be com
fortable, and should regard the
achievement of his object 'as so meri
torious a feat- In various ways every
thing', from the gymnastic aocaratus in
the hall to the leg-rest in front of the
study fire, sought and subserved tha

recalling that, though his host might
be fond of elegant Lounging, he was a

Mrs. Raymore was giving a little din
ner at her house In Buckingham Gate
in honor of Grantley Imason and his
wife. They had made their honeymoon
a short one, and were now in Sloane
street for a month before settling at
Milidean for the autumn. The gather-
Ing was of Grantley'F friends, one of
the sets with whom he had spent much
of his timÂ»- In bachelor days. The men
were old-time friends; .as they had
married, the wives had become his ac
quaintances too â in sume cases (as in
Mr?. Raymore's) more than mere ac
quaintances- They had all been inter
ested-in him. ar.d consequently were
turious about his wife â critical, no
doubt, but prepared to be friendly and
to take her into the set. if she would
come. Mrs. Raymore, as she eat at the
head of her table, with <;rantley by her
and Sibylla on Raymore's right hand at
the other end, was thinking that they,
in their turn, might reasonably inter
est the young bride â might set her
thinking, and encourage or discourage
her according to the conclusions she
came to about them. Fhe and Raymore
would bear scrutiny well, as things
v.xnt. Th*Â»re.was a very steady and af
fectionate friendship between them;
they lived comfortably together, and
had brought up their children â a boy
and a girlâ successfully and without
friction. Raymore â a tall man with a
ixddfsh face and deliberate of speech â
\ras always patient and reasonable. He
had never been very impassioned;
there had not been much to lose
of what is most easily lost.
He might have had a few
more intellectual tastes, perhaps, and
a keener interest in things outside his
business, but she had her own friends
and. r>n thi* whole, there was little to
complain of.
Then came the Fanshaws â John and
Christine. He was on the , stock ex
chJinff**; she, a dainty, pretty woman,
given up to society and to being very
well dressed but pleasant, kind, and
clever in a light sort of way. They
liked to entertain a good deal and got
through a lot of money. When Fan
shaw was making- plenty and Christine
had, plenty to spend, things went
smoothly enoughJ In bad times there
was trouble, each thinking ' that re
trenchment ooul(] best be practiced by
the other and in regard to the ex
penses to â¢ which the other was ad
dicted; it was, for instance, the
stables apainst the dressmaker then.
The happiness of the household de
pended largely on the state of the mar
ketsâ a thing which it mifjht Interest
Mrs. Grantley Imason to hear.
Next came the Selfordsâ Richard and
Janet. He was a rather small frail
man. of private means, a dabbler in
art. ShÂ« was artistic, too, or would
have tt/Id you so, end fond of exotic
dogs, which she imported from far-off
places and which usually died soon.
They were a gushing pair, both toward
one another and toward the outside
srorld; almost aggressively affectionate
in public. "Trying to humbug every
body," Torn Courtland ustd to say. but
that was too sweeping a view. Their
excessive amiability was the result of
their frequent quarrels â or rather tiffs,
since quarreling Is perhaps an over
vigorous word. They were always
either concealing the existence of a tiff
or making one up, reconciling them
selves with a good deal of display.
Everybody knew this, thanks in part
to their sharp-eyed, sharp-tongued
daughter, Anna, a girl of Eeventeen.
who knew all about the tiffs and could
always be got to talk about them.
The last pair were the Courtlands
themselves. All the set was rather
afraid of Lady Harriet. She was a
tftllj handsome, fair woman; she pat
ronized them rather, but was generally
affable and agreeable when nothing
occurred to upset her. Tom Courtland
grew more depressed, heavy, and
dreary every day. A crisis was ex
pectedâbut Lady Harriet's small-talk
did not suffer. Mrs. Raymore thought
that the less Clrantley's wife saw or
knew of that household the better.
The party was completed by Souzette
mi^h, a girl pretty In a faded sort of
way, not quite so young as she tried
to look, ami in Mrs. Raymore's opin
ion, quite likely not to marry at all;
and finally by young Blake, Walter
Dudley Blake, a favorite of hers and
of many 'other people, known as a
climber of mountains and a shooter of
rare game In his energetic days; sus
pected of enjoying life somewhat to
excess and with riotous revelry In his
seasons of leisure; impetuous, chival
rous, impulsive, and . notably good
looking. Mrs. Raymore had put him on

and cynical order, but he went even
further. The view which Grantley
bad suggested to him, which had never
crossed his mind till it was put
before him by another, the dis
illusioned view, he represented now
not as Grantley*E, but as his own.
He threw it out as an Idea which
naturally presented Itself to a man
of the world, giving the Impression
that it had been in his mind all along,
even while Mrs. Mumple was speaking.
And now he asked Sibylla, not perhaps
altogether to believe in it. but to think
it possible, almost probable, and cer
tainly very diverting.
Sibylla heard him through In silence,
her eyes fixed on him in a regard grave
at first, becoming, as he went on, al
most frightened.
"Do ideas like that come into men's
minds?" she asked at the end. She
did r.ct suspect that the idea had not
been her brother's own In the begin
ning. "I think It's a horrible idea."
"Oh. you're so high-falutin'!" he
laughed, glad, perhaps, to have shocked
her a little.
She came up to him and touched his
arm imploringly. *
"Forget It," she urged. "Never think
about it again. Oh, remember how
much, how terribly she loves him!
Don't have such Ideas." She drew back
a little- "I thinkâ I think it's almostâ

â devilish!"
That hit Jeremy: It was more than
he wantad.
"De\-i!lEh? Tou call it devilish? Why.
It wasâ" He had been about to lay
the Idea to Its true I ather-mind ; but
he did not. He looked at his sister
again. "Well, I'm sorry," he grumbled.
"It only 6truck me as rather funny."
Sibylla's wrath vanished.
"It's Just because you know nothing
about It that you could think such a
thing, poor boy." said the.
It became clearer still that Grantley
must not be brought in, because the
only explanation which mitigated
Jeremy's offense could not help Grant
ley. Jeremy was loyal here, whatever
he may have been to Mrs. Mumple. He
kept Grantley out of It. But â devilish!
What vehement language for the girl
to use.
Grantley nodded.
"I broke, off all that sort of thing.
I could have gone straight. She's
driven me to; It â by Jove, she has!"
"Take care, old chap. They'll notice
you."
"I don't care Ifâ Oh, all right, and
thanks, Grantley. I don't want to
make an exhibition of myself. And
I've told nobody but you, of course."
Sibylla, never long In coming to con

was entirely negligible; she* ' had
not , spoken save to . flirt very
mildly with Blake. Mrs. Ray
more elicited a liking, but a rather
timid and distant one; she -seemed
very clear-sighted and Judicial. Chris
tine Fanshaw attracted, her most, first
by her dainty ry;ettiness, also by the
perfection of her clothes (a thing
Sibylla much admired), most by her
friendly air and the piquant suffusion
of sarcastic humor that she had. She
seemed to treat eyen her own griev
ances In this semi-serious way â one of
them certainly, if her husband were
one. Such a manner and such a way
of regarding things are often most at
tractive to the people who would find
it hardest to acquire the like for
themselves; they seem to make the
difficulties which have loomed so largo
look smallerâ they extenuate, smooth
away, and, by the artifice of not ask
ing too much, cause what is given to
appear a more liberal Installment of the
possible. They are not, however, gen
erally associated /with any high or
rigid moral Ideas, and were not so as
sociated In the person of pretty Chris
tine Fanshaw. But they are entirely
compatible with much worldly wisdom,
and breed a tolerance of unimpeach
able breadth, if not of exalted origin.
"We'll be friends, won't we?" Chris
tine said to Sibylla, settling herself
cozily by her. "I'm. rather tired of all
these women, except K!ate Raymore,
and she doesn't much approve of me.
But I'm going to like you."
"Will you? I'm so glad."
"And I can be very useful to you.
I can even improve your frocks â
though this one's very nice; and I
cfiilh tell you all about husbands. I
know a great dealâ and I'm represen
tative." She laughed gayly. "John
and I are quite representative. I like
John, really, you know, he's a good
man â but he's selfish, Â». And John likes
me, but I'm selfish. And I like teas
ing John, and/ he takes a positive
pleasure sometimes in annoying me."
"And that's representative?" smiled
Sibylla.
'Oh, not by Itself, but as an ele
ment, sandwiched in with the rest â
with our really liking one another
and getting on all right, you know.
And when we quarrel, it's about some-
. thing, not about nothing, like the Sel
fords â though I don't know that that
is quite so representative, after all."
She paused a moment, and â¢ resumed
less gayly, with a little wrinkle on her
brow: "At. least, I think John really
likes me. Sometimes I'm not sure,
though I know I like him; and when
I'm least sure I tease him most."
"Is that a good remedy?"
"Remedy?^ No, It's" temper, my
dear. You see, there was a time when
â when I didn't care whether he liked
me or not; when I â -when I â we'll,
when I didn't care, as I said. And I
think he felt I didn't. And I don't
know whether I've ever quite got

Ready with sympathy, Sibylla press
ed the little richly beringed hand.
"Oh, Jt's all right. We're- very
. lucky. Look at the Courtlands.".
"The poor Courtlands seem to exist
to make other people appreciate their
own good luck," said Sibylla, laugh
ing a little. .;
"I'm sure they- ought to make you
appreciate yours. Grantley and
Walter Blake are two of the most
sought-after men, and you've mar

said, drumming his "fingers cm the

one word:

at her husband. A moment's silence
fell on the table. It seemed that they
recognized a difference between troub
les and grievances which could bV dis
cussed with more or less good-nature,
or quarreled over with more or less
acerbity, and those which were in an
other category. The moment the Court
lands were In question a constraint
arose. Tom Courtland himself broke
the silence, but It was to talk about
an important cricket match. Lady
Harriet smiled at him composedly, un
conscious of the earnest study of
Sibylla's eyes, which were fixed on
her and were asking (as Mrs. Raymore
would have said) many questions.
When the ladles had gone, Fanshaw
buttonholed Raymore and exhibited to
him his financial position and its exi
gencies with ruthless elaboration and
with a persistently implied accusation
of Christine's extravagance. Selford
victimized young Blake with the story
of a picture which he had Just picked
up; he declared it was by a famous
Dutch master, and watched for the ef
fect on Blake, who showed none, never
having heard of the Dutch master.
Tom Courtland edged up to Orantley's
side; they had not met since Orantley's
wedding. X.
"Well, you look very blooming and
happy, and all that," he said.
"First- rate, old boy. How are you?"
Tom lowered his voice and spoke with
a cautious air.
"I've done it, Grantley-rwhat I wrote
to you. By God, I couldn't stand It any
longer! I'd sooner take any risk. Oh, 1
I shall be very careful I I shan't give
myself away. But I had to do it."
Grantley gave a shrug.
"Oh, well. I'm sorry." he said. "That

ing match with Christine. She took
him to task for alleged dissipation and
over much gayety; he defended his
character and habits with playful
warmth. Sibylla sat by silent; she
was still very ignorant of all the life
they talked about. She knew that
Christine's charges carried innuendoes
from the way Blake met them, but she
did not know what the innuendoes
were. But she was not neglected. If
his words were lor gay Christine his
eyes were constantly for the graver
face and the more silent lips. He let
her see his respectful admiration in
the frank way he had; nobody could
take offense at it.
"I suppose you must always have
somebody to be in love with â to give,
oh, your whole heart and soul to,
mustn't you?" Christine asked scorn
fully.
"Yes, it's a necessity of my nature."
"That's what keeps you a bachelor,
I suppose?"
He laughed, but. as Sibylla thought,
a trifle ruefully, or at least as though
he were a little puzzled by Christine's
swift thrust.
"Keeps him? He's not old enough
to marry yet," she pleaded, and Blake
gayly accepted the defense.

giving the men cigars while their
wives put their cloaks on. Grantley
asked for a cab, which waa some lit
tle while In coming; .Tom Courtland
said he wanted a hansom, too, and
stuck his cigar In his mouth, puffing
out a full cloud of smoke. At that
moment Lady Harriet came back Into
the hall, Sibylla following her.
"Do you intend to smoke that ci
gar in the brougham aa we go to my
mother's party?" asked Lady Harriet.
"I'm not aware that your mother
minds smoke; but as a matter of fact
I'm not going to the party at alL"
"You're expectedâ I said you'd
come." â
"I'm sorry, Harriet, but you mis
understood me."
Tom Courtland stood his ground
firmly and answered civilly, though
with a surly rough tone In his voice.
His wife was still very quiet, yet Ray
more and Grantley exchanged appre
hensive looks; the lull before the storm
Is a well-worked figure of speech, but
they knew it applied very well to Lady
Harriet.
"You're going home, then?"
"Not Just now."
"Where are you going?"
"To the club."
"What club?"
"Is my cab there?" Grantley called
to the butler.
"Not yet, sir; there'll be one di
rectly." Â¦ '
"What club?" demanded Lady Har
riet again.
"What does It matter? I, haven't
made up my mind. I'm only' going to
have a rubber."
Then it cameâ what Sibylla had been
told about, what the others had seen
before now. They were all forgotten â
host and even the ser
vants, even the cabman, who heard the
outburst and leaned down from his high
-seat, trying to see. It was like some
physical affliction, an utter loss of self
control; it was a bare step distant from
It'was the failure of civiliza
tion, the castlng-off of decency, a being
abandoned to a raw fierce ,fury.
"Club!" <she cried, a deep flush cov
ering her face and all her neck. VPret
ly clubs you' go to at hard on'mid
night! I know you, I know you too
well, you â you liar!"
Sibylla crept behind Grantley. passing
her hand through ;hls arm. Tom
Courtland stood motionless, very white,
a stiff smile on his lips.
"You liar!" she said once again, and
without a look at any of them swept
down the steps. She moved srrandlly.
She came to the door of her brougham,
which the footman held for her. The
window was. drawn up.
"Have you been driving with the
windows shut?"
"Yes, my lady."
"I told you to keep them down when
it was fine. Do you want to stifle me.
you fool?" She raised the fan she
carried; it had stout Ivory sticks and
a large knob of Ivory at the end. She
dashed.,the knob against the window
with all her strength; the glass was
broken and fell clattering on the pave
ment as Lady Harriet got in. The
footman shut the door, touched his hat.
and joined the coachman oh the box.
With his pale face and set smile, with
his miserable eyes and bowed should
ers, Tom Courtland went down the
steps to his cab. Neither did he look at
any of them.
At last Raymore turned to Sibylla. '
"I'm so sorry it happened to-nightâ
when you were here," he Bald.
"What does it mean?" she gasped.
She looked from Grantley to Ray
more and back again, and read the
answer in their faces. They knew
where Tom Courtland had gone.
Grantley patted her hand gently, and
said to Raymore: f
"Well, who could stand a savage like
that?"
It was the recognition of a ruin In
evitable and past cure.
"Yes, I think you'd do that very
well â quite well enough. Grantley."
"There's a sting In the tail of your
praise?"
"After all, I'm a woman, too."
"We really needn't fuss ourselves, I
think. You see, she has the great
paving grace â a sense of humor. If
I perceive dimly that somehow some
thing hasn't been quite what It ought
to have been, that I haven't â haven't
played up somehow â you know what I
mean?"
"Very well, indeed." Mrs. Raymore
laughed gently.
"I can put it all right by a good
laugh â a bit of mock heroics, perhaps â
some good chaff, followed by a good
gallop â not at all a bad prescription!
After a little of that, she's laughing
at herself for having the emotions, and
at me for not having them, and at both
of us for the whole affair."
"Well, as long as it ends like that
there's not much wrong. But take
care. Not everything will stand the
humorous asr>ect, you know."
"Most things, thank heaven, or where
should we be?"
"Tom Courtland, for instance?"
"Oh, not any longer, I'm afraid."
"It won't do for the big things and
the desperate cases; not even for other
people's â much less for your own."
"I suppose not. If you want It al
ways, you must be a looker-on; and
you'll tell me husbands can't be look
ers-on at their own marriages?"
"I tell you! Facts will convince you
sooner than I could, Grantley."
He was really very reasonable from
his own point of view, both reasonable
and patient. Mrs- Raymore conceded
that. And he was also quite consistent
in his point of view. She remembered
a phrase from his letter which had de
fined what he was seekingâ "a com
pletion, not a transformation." He was
pursuing that scheme still â a scheme
into which the future wife had fitted
so easily and perfectly. Into which the
actual wife fitted with more difficulty.
But he was dealing with the difficulty
in a very good spirit and a very good
temper. If the scheme were possible
at all â given Sibylla as she was â he
was quite the man to put it through
successfully. But she reserved her
opinion as to Its possibility. The reser
vation did not imply an approval of
"In anything like a doubtful case,"
he complained humorously (for he was
not taking the questions very serious
ly), "the man never gets fair play.
He's not nearly so picturesque. And
if he becomes picturesque, if he goes
through fits hot and cold, and ups and
downs, and all sorts of convulsions, as
the woman does and does so effective
ly, he doesn't get any more sympathy,
because It's not the Ideal for the man
not our national ideal, anyhow. You
see the dilemma he's In? If he's not
emotional he's 'not interesting; if he's
emotional he's not manly. I'm speak
ing of a doubtful case all the time. Of
course you may have your impeccable
Still-Waters-Run-Deep sort of manâ
the part poor old Tom ought to have
played. But then that Is a part â a
stage part, very, seldom real. No; in
a doubtful case the man's nowhere.
Take it how you will, the woman is
bound to win."
"Which means that you don't want to
complain or criticize, but If I will put
Impertinent questions 'â¢
"If you put me -on my defense â " he
amended, laughing.
,"Yes, If I put you ou your defense,
you'll hint "
"Through generalities "
"Yes, through generalities you'll hint.
In your graceful way, that Sibylla, of
whom you're very fond "
"Oh, be fair! You know I am."
"Is rather â exacting â fatiguing?"
"That's too strong. Rather, as I
say, emotional. She likes living on the
heights. I like going up there now and
then. In fact I maintain the national
ideal-"
or on the Impulse of any startling to
cldent. As she went to and fro on her
work and her pleasure, the figures
gradually and insensibly set them
selves in rows, added and subtracted
themselves and presented her with the
quotient. It was against her will that
all this happened. She would bar* had
none of iti there was 'nothing to y*eoxnÂ»
mend it: It was not even unusual. But
it would come â and what did It com*
to? Nothing alarming or vulgar or
sensational. Qrantley'B gallantry for
bade that, his good manners, his af
fectionate ways, his real love for her.
It was forbidden, too, by the moments
of rapture which she excited and
which she shared; they were still un
touchedâthe fairy rides on fairy
horses. But It Is not the virtue of such
things to mean more than they areâ
to be not incidents, but rather culmin
ationsânot exceptions, but the very
type, the highest expression of what
is always there? Even the raptures
she was coming to doubt while she
welcomed, to mistrust while she
shared. Would she come at once to
hate and to strive after them?
In the end It was not the identity her
soaring fancy had pictured, not the
union her' heart cried for, less even
than the partnership which naked rea
son seemed to claim. She had not be
come his very self, as he was of her
very self â nor part of him. She was to
himâ what? Bhe sought a word, at
least an Idea, and smiled at one or two
which her own bitterness offered to
her. A toy? Of course not A diver
sion? Much more than that. But still
It was something accidental, something
that he might not have had and would
have done very well without; yet a
something greatly valued, tended,
caressed â yes, and even loved. A great
acquisition perhaps expressed Itâ a
very prized possessionâ a cherished
treasure. Sometimes, after putting
It as low as she could In cha
grin, she put It aa high aa she
couldâ by way of testing It. Put it how
she would, the ultimate result worked
, out the same. She made much less
difference to Grantley Imason than Bhe
had looked to make; she was much less
of and In his life, much less of the
essence, more of an accretion. She
was outside his Innermost self â a
stranger to his closest fastnesses. Was
that the nature of the tie or the nature
of the man? She cried out against
either conclusion; for either ruined the
hopes of which she lived. Among them
was one mighty hope. Were not both
tie and man still incomplete, even as
she. the woman, was in, truth yet in
complete, yet short of her great func
tion; undischarged for her high nat
unal office? Was there not that in
her now which should make all things
complete and perfect? While that hope
ânay, that convictionâ remained she
refused to admit that she was discon
tent. She waited, trying meanwhile
to smother the discontent.
Of course there was another side, and
Grantley himself put it to Mrs. Ray
more when, in her sisterly affection for
him and her motherly Interest in Si
bylla, she had ventured on two or three
questions which, on the smallest
analysis, resolved themselves into
hints. â¢ Â«
"I'm quite content with my own,"
smiled Mrs. Selford. "Dick and I al
ways agree."
"They must be fresh from a row,"
Tom Courtland whispered surlly to
Mrs. Raymore.
"About money matters the man's
voice must in the nature of things be
filial," Fanshaw insisted. "It's obvi
ous. He knows about it; he makes
it "
"Quite enough for him to do," Chris
tine interrupted. "At that point we
step inâ and spend it."
"Division of labor? Quite right,
Mrs. Fanchaw," laughed Blake. "And
if any of you can't manage your de
partment, I'm ready to help."
"They can manage that department
right enough," Fanshaw grumbled. "If
we could manage them as well as they
manage that " He took a great
gulp of champagne, and grew still red
der when he heard Christine's scornful
little chuckle. " -
Raymore turned to Sibylla with a
kind, fatherly smile.
"I hope we're not frightening you,
Mrs- Imason? Not too much of the
eeamy side?" Â¦
Blake chimed in on the other hand:
"I'm here to maintain Mrs. Imason's
illusions."
"If we're talking of departments, 1
think that's mine, Blake, thank you,"
called Grantley with a laugh.
"I'm sure I've been most consider
ate." This was Lady Harriet's first
contribution to the talk. "I haven't
said a word."
"And you could a tale unfold?"
asked Blake.
She made no answer beyond shrug
ging her fine shoulders and leaning
back in her chair as she glanced across
"Horses!" said Christine, with sharp
pointed emphasis. "You should really
be guided by Mr. Selford, John."..
"Every husband should be guided by
another husband. That's axiomatic,"
said Grantley. â¢
"Are clothes.superflultles?" interject
ed Christine, watching the gradual
flushing of her husband's face with
mischievous pleasure.
"Nothing is superfluous that is beau
tiful," said Selford; he lisped slightly,
and spoke with ait affected air. "We
should retrench in the grosser pleasures
âeating and drinking, display, large
houses "
"Peculiar dobs?" suggested Blake,
chaffing Mrs. Selford.
"Oh, but they are beautiful!" she
cried.
"You've told me nothing about
Sibylla. I shall have to find it all
out for myself."
"That's the only knowledge worth
having; and I'm only learning myself
still, you know."
"Really, that's an unusually just
frame of mind for a husband! I've
high hopes of you, Grantley."
"Good! Because you know me un
commonly well."
She thought a moment
"Xo, not so very well,'" she said.
"You're hard to know."
He took that as a compliment;
probably most people would, since it
seems to hint at something rare and
out of the common; inaccessibility has
an aristocratic flavor.
"Oh, I suppose we all have our
fastnesses," he said with a laugh
which politely waived any claim to
superiority without expressly aban
doning it.
"Dosen't one give up the key of the
gates by marrying?" â¢
"My dear Kate, read your Blue
beard again!"
Mre. Kaymore relapsed into the si
lence that was almost habitual to her,
but it passed through her mind that
the conversation had soon turned from
Sibylla to Grantley himself, or at least
had dealt with Sibylla purely In her
bearing on Grantley; It had not in
creased her knowledge of Mrs. Ima
son as an independent individual.
"Well, with business what it is,"
Faid Fanshaw in his loud voice â a
voice that had a way of stopping other
people's voices â "we must cut it down
somewhere."
"Oh, you're as rich as Croesus, Fan
shaw:" objected young Blake.
"I'm losing money every day. Chris
tine and I were discussing it as we
drove here."
"I like your idea of discussion,
John," remarked Christine in her deli
cate tones, generally touched with sar
casm. "I couldn't open my lips."
"He clpsured you, and then threw
out your tbudget?" asked Grantley.
"He almost stripped my gown from
my back and made an absolute clutch
at my diamonds."
"I put forward the reasonable view,"
Fanshaw insisted rather heatedly.
"What I said was, begin with superflu
ities "

one terrible example â the Courtlands;
but when it comes to throwing things
about, the case is admittedly abnormal.
For the rest they seemed, to the stu- 4
dent of matrimony, fair average Barn
plea of a bulk of fair average merit.
Perhaps there might have been an ideal
union â Just to counterbalance the
Courtlands at the other extreme. If
such were desirable, let it be hoped
that the Imasons themselves wqirtd
supply it. In regard to one point she
decided, the company was really above
the average â and that was the most
Important point. There had been rumors
once about Christine Fanshaw â Indeed
they were still heard sometimes; but
scandal had never assailed any other
woman there. In these days that was
something, thought Mrs. Raymore.
Grantley turned from Christine Fan
ehaw to hia hostess.
"You're very silent. "What are you
thinking about?" he asked.
"Sibylla's really beautiful, and In a
rather unusual way. You, might pass
her over once; but If you did look
once you'd be sure to look always."
â¢ "Another woman's looks have kept
your attention ail this time?"
"Your wife," ehe reminded him
with affectionately friendly glance.
"And I was wondering what she
thought of us all, what we all look
like In those pondering, thoughtful.
Questioning eyes of hers."
"Her eyes do ask question*, don't
they?" laughed- Grantley.
"Many, many, and must have an
swers. I should think. And don't they
expect good answers?"
"Oh, she's not really at all alarm
ing."
"You can make the eyes say some
thing: different, I dare say?"
He laughed again very contentedly.
Mrs. Raymore's admiration pleased
him, since she was not very easy her-
Eelf to please. He was glad she ap
proved of Sibylla, though as a rule
his own opinion was enough for him.
"Well, they aren't always question-
Ing. That would be fatiguing in a
wife â really as bad as continually dis- 1
cussing the Ariaa heresy, as old John
son says. But I daresay," he lowered
hie voice, "Lady Harriet would excite
a query or two " "

"The captive of your bow and

what could ba closer than that? At
this time any criticism of him waa
genuinely unintelligible; he could make

had said, he could always soothe.
"And she's going on quite all right?"
Christine continued.
"Splendldlyl We've got her Quietly

"Call on me?"
"I ventured so farâ and get back ai
soon as I can."
"You must be very pleased?"
"Of course I'm pleased." he laughed,
"very pleased Indeed, Christine."
He was very much pleased, and
laughed at himself, as he had laughed
at others, for being a little proud too.
He had wanted the dynasty car
ried on. There was every pros
pect of a start being made in that di
rection very prosperously. He would
have hated to have It otherwise; there
would have been a sense of incom
pleteness then.
"I needn't tell a wise woman like
you that there's some trouble about
such things," he went on.
"No doubt there is." smiled Chris
tine. "But you can leave most of that
to Sibylla and the favorite old wom
an," she added a moment later, with
her eyes on Grantley'a contented, face
and that touch of acidity in her clear
tone voice.

Her great talent, her strongest innate

impulse her husband had not satisfied.

they fell short of the largest that were
possible. The great satisfaction, the
great outlet, lay in the coming of thq

the head of the child she would at
the same time pour It out at the feet
of him whose the child was. Before

Her presence was Indispensable, and
valued as such, but it had some disad

youth, of beauty and of circumstance
which served so well to soften or to
recommend them. The sort of atmos

her was one which should be diffused

years change youth to maturity, ma

force latent antagonisms of feeling to
an open conflict. Mistress Chance took
a hand in the game. On arriving at the
Fairhaven station from one of his ex
peditions to town.' Grantley found Jer
emy awaiting him. Jeremy was pale,
but his manner kept its incisiveness,
his speech its lucidity. Sibylla had mot
with an accident. She had still been
taking quiet rides on a trusty old horse.
To-day, contrary to his advice and in
face of Grantrey'?. she had insisted on
riding anotherâ the young horse, as
they called It. Â«
"She was in one cf her moods." Jer
emy explained. "She said she wanted
more of a fight than the old horse gave
her. She would go. Well, you know
that great beast of a dog of Jarman's?
It was running loose â I saw it myself;
indeed. I saw the whole thing. She was
trotting along, thinking of nothing at
all, I suppose. The dog started a rab"
bit and came by her with a bound. The
horse started, jumped half his own
height â or it looked like it â and sheâ
camo off. you know â pitched clean out
of her saddle."
"Clear of theâ T'
"Ye?, thank God â but the came down
with an awful â an awful thud. I ran
up as quick as I could. She was uncon
scious. A couple of laborers helped me
to take her home, and I got Mumples;
and en my way here I stopped at Gar
diner's and sent him there, and came'
on to tell you."
By now they were getting Into the
degcart.
"Do you know at all how bad it is?"
asked Grantley.
"Not the least. Kow should I?"
"Well, we must get home as quick as
we can."
Grantley did not speak again the
whole way. His mind had been full of
plans that morning. His position as a
man of land at Milldean was opening
new prospects to him. He had agreed
to come forward for election as a coun
ty Alderman; he had been sounded as
to contesting the seat for the division.
He had been very full of these notions
and had meant to spend two or three
quiet days in re%"iewins: and considering
them. This sudden shock was hard to
face and realize. It was difficult, too,
to conceive of anything being wrong
with Sibylla â always so tine an embodi
ment of physical health and vigor. He
felt very helpless and in terrible dis
tress. It turned him sick to think of
the "awful thud" that Jeremy de
scribed. What would that mean? What
was the least it might, the most it
could, mean?
doubtedly! I â I can't say it isn't se
rious. I Ehould be doing wrong "
"In one word, is it fatal, or likely to
be fatal?" ,
Grantley was nearly at the end of
his forced patience. He had looked for
a man â he had, it seemed, found an
other old woman; so he angrily thought
within himself as old Gardiner
stumbled over his words and worried
his whiskers.
"If I were to explain the case in de
tail "
"Presently, doctor, presently. Just
now I want the result â the position of
affairs, you know."
"For the moment, Mr. Imason. there
is no danger to Mrs. Imason â I think
I may say that. But the injury creates
a condition of things which might, and
in my judgment would, prove, danger
ous to her as time went on. I speak in
view of her present condition."
"I s*ee. Could that be obviated?"
Gardiner's nervousness increased.
"By an operation directed to remove
the cause which would produce danger.
It would be a serious, perhaps a
dangerous, operation "
"Is that the only way?'*
"In my judgment the only way con
sistent with "
A loud sob from Mrs. Mumple Inter
rupted him. Grantley swore under his
breath.
"Go on," he said harshly.
"Consistent with tha birth of the
child. Mr. Imason."
"Ah!" at last he had got to the
light and the nervous old man had
managed to deliver himself of his mes
sage. 'I understand you now. Setting
the birth of the child on one side, the
matter would be simpler?"
"Oh, yes. much simpler â not, of
course, without its â "
"And more free from danger?"
"Yes. though â "
"Practically free from danger to my
wife?"
"Yes; I think I can say practically
free in the case cf so good a subject
as Mrs. Imason."
Grantley thought for fc" minute.
"You probably wouldn't object to- my
having- another opinion?" he asked.
Relief was obvious on old Gardiner's
face.
"I should welcome It," he said. "The
responsibility in such a case Is so great
thatâ"
"Tell me the best man and I'll wire
for him at once."
Even on this point Gardiner hesi
tated, till Grantley named a man
known to everybody; him Gardiner at
onte accepted.
morning; she was reluctant to wait
even for that. Old Gardiner was for
her an all-wise, all-sufficient oracle of
the facts, because he had declared them
to be such as fitted into the demands
of her heart and of her mood. Left to
herself she would have constrained hi%
fears, overborne his doubts and forced
him to her will; he would have stamr
mered all in vain about what was the
British medical practice. As It was,
open-eyed, refusing to seek sleep,
strung up by excitement, all through
the evening she battled against her
husband for her way.
If she had no hesitation in one view,
Grantley never wavered from the other.
The plain unreasonableness of not
awaiting the specialist's verdict was
not hard to enforce. Sibylla, professing
to yield, yet still assumed what the
verdict would be, and pressed for a
promise. At first he evaded her ur
gency by every device of soothing
counsels, of entreaties that she would
rest, of affectionate reproofs. She
would not allow evasion. Then when
his refusal came it came tenderly. In
spired by his love for her, based on an
appeal to that. It was on this that she
had relied. He was puzzled that it
failed of the full effect he had looked
for; and beyond the puzzle gradually a
sense of bitter hurt and soreness grew
up in his mind. He did not know of the
secret connection in her thoughts be- -
tween the child and an Ideal perfecting
of the love between her and him; she
was at once too self-engrossed to allow
for his ignorance and too persuaded
that her hopes must be secret if they
were to remain hopes at all. He saw
only that when he persuaded, cajoled,
flattered and caressed as a lover he
failed. His -power seemed gone. Her
appeal to him was in another character*
and that very fact seemed to put him
on a lower plane. He had not doubted
for a moment what came first to him â
it was her life, her well-being, his love
of her. As she persisted in her battle
foolishness, which he â¢ had been wont
to divide very distinctly from her, and
to consider himself free to deal with
faithfully.
"At best It'll be a most awful disap
pointment to her." .
"Yes, it must be that â and to me,
too," said "Grantley.
"She was Just living In and for the
thing, you know."
Grantley made no answer this time;
a shade of annoyance passed over his
face.
"She never could give herself to
more than one thing at a time â with
her that one thing was always the
whole hog, and there was nothing
else. That's just how lt'3 been now."
Jeremy's words showed true sym
pathy, and, moreover, a new absence
of shame in expressing it; but Grant
ley did not accord them much appar
ent welcome. They came too near to
confirming- his suspicions; they har
monized too well with the soreness
which remained from his impotent en
treaties and unpersuasive caresses.
Again without answering, he got up
and lit his cigar.
"Oh, by the way," Jeremy went on,
"while you were with Sibylla that girl
from the rectory came up â you know,
Dora Huttingâ to ask after Sibylla and
say th?y were all awfully sorry and
anxious, and all that, you know."
"Very kind of them. I hope you told
her so. and said what you could?"
"Tea, that's all right. The girl seems
awfully fond of Sibylla, Grantley. By
Jove, when we got talking about her,
she â she began to cry!"
Grantley. turned round, smiling at the
unaccustomed note of pathos struck by
Jeremy's tone.
"Rather decent of her, wasn't It?"
asked Jeremy.
"Very nice. Did you console her?"
"Oh, I didn't see what the devil I
could say.' Besides I didn't feel very
comfortable â it was rather awkward."
"I believe the girl's afraid of me â
ming eyes and over brimming sympa
thies. That he could not truthfully
have denied the fact increased his an
noyance. It seemed mean to remem
ber the spots- that had been on the
face to which those brimming eyes be
longedâas mean as It would have
been in himself to recall the bygone
grievances and the old â the suddenly
old grown â squabbles which he had
had with the long legged rectory girl.
That old epithet, too! A sudden sense
of profanity shot across him as it
came Into his mind; he stood Incom
prehensibly accused of irreverence in
his own eyes.
Yet the spots had existed and Si
bylla had been wrong â had been wrong
and was now, it appeared, unreason
able. Moreover, beyond question.
Mumples was idiotic. Reason was
alarmed* in him since it was threaten
ed. He told himself that Grantley was
very sensible to sleep. But himself,
he could "not think of sleep and hia
ears were hungry for every sound
from the floor above.
The stairs creakedâ there was a sniff.
Mrs. Mumple was at the door. Jeremy
made an instinctive gesture for silence
because Grantley slept. He watched
Mrs. Mumple as she turned her eyes
on the peacefully reposing form. The
eyes turned sharp to him and Mrs.
Mumple raised her fat hands just a
little and let them fall softly.
"He's asleep?" she whispered.
"You see he is. Best thing for him
to do, too." Hi3 answering whisper
was gruff.
'"She's not sleeping," said Mrs.
Mumple, "and she's asking for him
again."
"Then we'd better wake him up." He
sgoke irritably as he rose and touched
Grantley's shoulder. "He must be
tired out, don't you see?"
- Mrs. Mumple made no answer. She
raised and dropped her hands again.
Grantley awoke lightly and easily,
almost unconscious that he had slept.
"What were we talking about? Oh.
yes, Dora Huttingl Why, I believe
I've beer, asleep!"
"You've slept nearly an hour," said
Jeremy, going back to his chair.
Grantley's eyes fell on^Mrs. Mumple;
a sllirht air of impatience marked his
manner as he asked:
"Is anything wrong. Mrs. Mumple?"
"She's asking for you again, Mr.
Imason." "Â¦"
"Dear me. Gardiner said she should
be kept quiet!"
"The doctor's lying down. But she'll
not rest without seeing you; she's
that. Only it's aâ a little unfortunate
that you should have happened on me.
because Xâ I can't understand beins
like that. To me it seems aomehow
rather cruel. So, knowing you're like
that, I can't believe you when, you tell
me that you think of nothing but your
love for me. I daresay you think it's
true â I know you wouldn't aay it if you
didn't think it true; and in a way it'a
true. But the real, real truth is â "
She paused, and for the first time
turned her eyes on him. "The real
truth is not that you love me too much
to do what I ask."
"What else can It be?" he cried
desperately, utterly puzzled and upset
by her accusation.
"What else can it be? ATi. yes. what
else?" Her voice grew rather more
vehement. "I can answer that. "What
have I been doing these five months
but learning the answer to that? I'll
tell you. It's not that you love. me so
much. It's that you don't care about
the child."
The words brought a suspicion Into
his mind.
"That old fool Mrs. Mumple has been
talking to you? She's been repeating
something I said? Well. I expressed It
carelessly, awkwardly, but "
"What does it matter what Mumples
has repeated? I knew it all before."
"Meddlesome old Idiot!" he grumbled
fiercely.
To him there was no reason In It all.
The accusation angered htm fiercely
and amazed him even more: he saw
no shadow of Justice In it. He out It
all down to Sibylla's exaggerated way
of talking and thinking. He was con
scious of no shortcomings; the accusa
tion infuriated the more for Its entire
failure to convince. "When two women
put their heads together and begin to
talk nonsense, there's no end to it;
bring a baby, bora or unborn, into the
case, and the last chance of any limit
to the nonsense is gone." He did not
tell her that (though it expressed what
he felt) in a general form; he fell back
on the circumstances of the minute.
"My dear Sibylla, you're not fit to
discuss things rationally at present.
We'll say no more now; we shall only
be still more unjust to one another If
we do. Only I must be obeyed."
"Yes. you shall be- obeyed," sh*
said. "But since It's like that. I think
that, whatever happens now. Iâ I won't
have any more children. Grantley."
"What?"
He was startled out of the cold com
posure which he had achieved in his
previous speech.
She repeated her words in a low tired
"You don't blame me?" Jeremy asked
as they came near home.
"You advised her not to ride the
beast; what more could you do? You
couldn't stop her by force."
He spoke rather bitterly, as though
Borrow and fear had not banished an
ger when he thought of his wife and
her willfulness.
Jeremy turned aside Into the garden,
begging to have news as soon as there
was any. Grantley went into his study
and Mrs. Mumple came to him there.
She was pitiably undone and dis
heveled. It was impossible not to re
spect her grief, but no less impossible
to get any clear information from her.
Lamentation altercated with attempt
ed excuses for Sibylla's obstinacy; she
tried to make out that she herself
was in some way to blame for having
brought ca the mood which had in its
turn produced th"e obstinacy. Grantley,
striving after outward calm, raced in
his heart against the fond, foolish old
woman.
"1 want to know what's happened,
not whose fault it'll be held to be at
the Day of Judgment, Mrs. Mumple.
Since you're incapable of telling me
anything, have the goodness to send
Dr. Gardiner to ne as soon as he can
leave Sibylla."
Very soon, yet only Just in time to
fetop Grantley from going upstairs
himself, Gardiner came. He was an
elderly, quiet-going country practition
er; he lived in one of the red villas at
the junction with the main road, and
plied a not very lucrative practice
among the farmhouses and cottaees.
His knowledge was neither Drofound
nor recent; he had not kept up his
reading, and his practical opportunities
had been very few. He seemed, when
he came, a good deal upset and de
cidedly nervous, as though he were
faced with a sudden responsibility by
no means to his liking. He kept wip
ing his brow with a threadbare red silk
handkerchief and pulling his straggling
gray whiskers while he talked. In a
second Grantley had decided that no
confidence could be placed in him. Still
he must bÂ« able to tell what was the
matter.
"Quickly and plainly, please. Dr.
Gardiner," he requested, noting with
impatience that Mrs. Mumple had come
back ana stood there listening: but
Ehe would cry and think him a mon
ster If he sent her away.
"She's conscious now," the doctor re
ported, "but she's very prostrateâsuf
fering from se\-ere shock. I think you
shouldn't see her for a little while."
'What's the injury. Dr. Gardiner?"
"The shock is severe."
"Will it kill her?"
"No, no! The shock kill her? Oh.
no, no! She has a splepdid constitu
tion. Kill her' Oh. no, no-!"
"'And is that all?"
"No, not quite all. Mr. Imason. There
is â er â in fact a local injury, a fracture,
due to the force of the Impact on the
ground."
"Is that serious? Pray be quiet, Mrs.
Mumple. You really must restrain
y$ur feelings."
"Serio-us? Oh, undoubtedly. un-
"Very well, and I'll see my wife as
soon as you think it desirable." He
paused a moment and then went on:
"If I understand the case right, I
haven't, a moment's hesitation In my
mind. But I should like to ask you
one question â am I right in supposing
that your practice is to prefer the
mother's life to the child's?"
"That's the British medical practice.
Mr. Imason, where the alternative is
as you put it. But there are^ of course,
degrees of danger and these would in
fluence â "
"You've told me the danger. might tyÂ»
serious. That's enough. Dr.'Gardiner,
pending the arrival ol your colleague
the only thingâ the only thingâ you
have to think of is my wife. Those
are my definite wishes, please. You'll
remain here, of course? Thank you.
We'll have another talk later. I want
to speak to Jeremy now."
He turned toward the window, mean
ing to join Jeremy in the garden and
report to him. Mrs. Mumple came'for
ward, waving her hands helplessly and
weeping profusely.
"Oh. Mr. Imason, imagine the poor,
poor little child!" she stammered. "I
can't bear to think of It."
Grantley's Impatience bro-ke out In
savage bluntness.
"Against her I don't care that for
the child!" he said, snapping his fin
gers as he went out. ;>.^*
CHAPTER VI.
Xot Teace, but a Sword.
No doubt the bodily shock, the lacera
tion of her nerves and the condition she
was In had something to do with the
way Sibylla looked at the matter and
with the attitude which she took up.
These accidental circumstances gave
added force to what was the natural
outcome of her disposition. A further
current of feeling, sweeping her In the
same direction, lay In the blame which
Ehe eagerly fastened on herself. Her
willfulness and heedlessness cried out
to her for an atonement; she was eager
to make an appeasing sac
rifice and caught at the op
portunity, embracing readily the
worst view of the case, drawing
from that view an unhesitating conclu
sion as to what her duty was. Thus de
duced, the duty became a feverish de
sire; her only fear was that she might
be balked of its realization. She had
risked her child's life; let her risk her
life for her child. That Idea was by
itself and by Its Innate propriety
enough to Inspire her mind and to de
cide her will. It was but to accumulate
reasons beyond need when she remind
ed herself that even before the accident
all her weal had hung on the child,
every chance which remained of over
coming certain failure, of achieving
still the splendid success of which she
had dreamed in her life and marriage.
The specialist was to arrive the next
the feeling grew that she made an in
adequate return and showed an appre
ciation short of what was his due.
Gradually his manner hardened, his
decision was expressed more firmly; he
stiffened into a direct antagonism and
Interposed his will and his authority
to effect what his love and his en
treaties had failed to win. He never
lacked courtesy; he could not, under
such circumstances as these,- desire to
fail in gentleness. But it was his will
against hers now, and what his will
was he conveyed clearly.
A trained* nurse had arrived from
Fairhaven; # but Sibylla vehemently pre
ferred the presence of Mrs. Mumple,
and it was Mrs. Mumple whom Grant
ley left with her when he came down
to his study about midnight. He had
not dined, and a cold supper was laid
out o* the table. Jeremy was there,
trying to read, eying the supper rav
enously, yet ashamed of being hungry.
He fell on the beef with avidity when
Grantley observed that" anyhow starv
ing themselves could serve no useful
purpose. Grantley was worried, but
not anxious; he had confidence In the
specialist, and even in Gardiner's view
there was no danger If the right course
were followed. To the disappointment
which" that course involved he had
schooled himself, accepting It almost
gladly as by so far the lesser evil.
"If you were to talk to Sibylla now,"
he said, "I think you'd be reminded of
those old days you once told me about.
Fate has thumped her pretty severely
for anything she did, but she's mortally
anxious to be thumped more, and very
angry with me because I won't allow
It- Upon my word I believe she'd be
disappointed If Tarlton told us that the
thing wasn't so bad after all, and that
everything would go right without
anything being done."
"I daresay she would; but there'3 no
chance of that?"
"Well. I'm afraid not. One must be
lieve one's medical man, I suppose,
even if he's old Gardinerâ and he seems
quite sure of it." Grantley drank and
slphed. "It's unc6mmonly ~ perverse,
when everything was so prosperous
before."
The day had left its traces on Jeremy.
Though he had not told Grantley so,
yet when he saw Sibylla thrown he
had made no doubt she was killedâ and
she was the one person In the world
whom he deeply loved. That fear was
off him now, but the memory of It soft
ened him toward her â even toward her
she always seems to come here when
I'm away. Is she a pleasant girl, Jer
emy?" -V T
"Oh, she â she seemed all right; and
I â I liked the way she felt about Si
bylla."
"So do I, and I thank her for it.
Is she getting at all prettier?"
"Well, I shouldn't call her bad look
ing, don't you know."
"She used to be a bit spotty," yawn
ed Grantley.
"I don't tjiink she's spotty now."
"Well, thank heaven for that any
how!" said Grantley piously. "I hate
spots above anything, Jeremy." A
"She hasn't got any. I tell you."
said Jeremy, distinctly annoyed.
Grantley smiled sleepily, threw him
self on to his favorite couch, laid down
his cigar and closed his eyes. After
the strain he was weary and soon hid
regular breathing showed that he
slept. Jeremy had got his pipe alight
and sat smoking, from time to time
regarding his brother-in-law's hand
some features with an inquiring gaze.
There was a new stir of feeling in
Jeremy. A boy of strong intellectual
bent, he had ripened slowly on the
emotional side, and there had been
nothing in the circumstances or
chances of his life to quicken the
process thus naturally very gradual.
To-day something had come. He hud
been violently snatched from his quiet
and hia Isolation, confronted with a
crisis that commanded feeling, probed
to the heart of his being by love and
fear. Under this call from life nascent
feelings grew tovbirth and suppressed
impulses struggled for liberty and for
power. He was" not now resisting
them nor turning from them. He was
watching, waiting, puzzling about
them, hiding them still from others,
but no longer denying them to him
self. He was wondering and astir.
The manhood which had come upon
him was a strange thing; the' life that
called him seemed now full of new
and strange things. Through his fear
and love for Sibylla he was entering
on new realms of experience and of
feeling. He sat smoking hard and
marveling- that Grantley slept.
Connected with this upheaval Of
mental conceptions which had hither
to maintained an aspect so boldly fun
damental 'and claimed to be the veri
table rock of thought whereon Jere
my built his church, was the curious
circumstance that he suddenly found
himself rather sensitive about Grant
ley's careless criticism of Miss Dora
Hutting's appearance. He had not de
nied the fact alleged about it. thpugh
he had the continuance of it. But he
resented its mention even as he ques
tioned the propriety of Grantley's
sleeping. The reference assorted ill
with his appreciation of Dora's brim-
!retting so."
"Have, you been letting her talk
about it and excite herself? Have you
been talki .g to her yourself?"
"How can we help talking about It?"
Mrs. Mumple moaned.
"It's infernally sillyâ infernally!" he
exclaimed in exasperation. "Well. I
must go to her, I suppose." He turned
to Jeremy. "It'll be better if you'll
keep Mrs. Mumple with you. We'll get
the nurse to go to Sibylla."
'I can't leave her as she is," said
Mrs. Mumple., threatening a fresh out
burst of tears.
Grantley walked out of the room,
muttering savagely. The strain of ir
ritation, largely induteoN by Mrs.
Mumple's Iachrymosely reproachful
glances and faithful doglike persist
ency, robbed him of the tenderness by
which alone he might possibly have
won his wife's willing obedience and
perhaps convinced her reason through
her love. He used his affection now
not In appeal, but as an argumentative
point. He found in her a hard opposi
tion: she seemed to Icok at him with
a. sort of dislike, a mingling of fear
and wonder. Thus she listened in sil
*nce to his cold" marshaling of the"
evidences of his love and his deliberate
enforcement of the claims it gave him.
Seeing that he made no impression, he
<rew more impatient and more im
perious, ending with a plain intimation
that he would discuss the question no
further.
"You'll make me the murderess of
my child." she said.
ThÂ° gross irrational exaggeration
drove him to worse bitterness.
"I've no intention of running even
the smallest risk of being pa/ty to the
murder of my wife," he retorted.
Lying among her pilh.-ws, very pale
and weary, she pronounced the accusa
tion which had so long brooded in her
mind.
"It's not because you love me so
much; you do love me in a way â I
please you, you're proud of me. you
like me to be there, you like to make
love to me. you like taking all I ha"ve
to give you, and God knows I liked to
give itâ but you haven't given the
same thing back to me, Grantley. J
don't know whether you've sot it to
give to anybody, but at any rate you
haven't given it to me. I haven't be
come part of you, as I was ready "lo
become â as I've already become of my
little unborn child. Your life wouldn't
be 4 made really different If I went
away. In the end you've been aDai t
from me. I thought the coming of the
child must make a.11 that different: but
it hasn't. You've been about the child
Just as you've been about me."
"Oh, where on earth do you get such
notions?" he exclaimed.
"Just the same as about me. You
wanted me. and you wanted a child too.
But you wanted both with â well, with
the least disturbance of your old self,
and your old thoughts: with the least
trouble â it almost comes to that really.
I. don't know how to put it. except like
that You enjoyed the pleasant Darts
very much, but you take as little as
you can of the troublesome ones. I
suppose a lot of people are â are like
voice, but firmly and coolly.
"I think I won't have any more
children, you know."
'"Do you know what you are say ins:?"
"Oh. surely, yes!" she answered, with
a faint smile.
Grantley walked up and down thf
room twice, and then came and stood
by her bed. fixing his eyes on her face
in a long somber contemplation. The
faint smile persisted on her lips as she
looked up at him. But he turned away
without speaking, with a weary shrug 1
of his shoulders.
"I'll send the nurse to you," he said
as he went toward the door.
"Sead Mumples, please, Grantley."
Mrs. Mumples had done all the harm
she could.
â¢'All right." he replied. "Try to
sleep. Good-night."
He shut the door behind him before
her answer came.
On the stairs he met Mrs. Mumple. -
The fat woman shrank out of his p^th.
but he bade her goo<5-nlgh't not un
kindly, though absently; she needed no
bidding- to send her to Sibylla's room.
He four.d Jeremy still in the study,
still wide awake.
"Oh. go home to bed, old fellow:" he
exclaimed irritably, but affectionately.
too. "What good can you do sitting up
here all night?"
"Yes, I suppose I may as well go â it's
half-past two. I'll go out by the gar
den." He opened the window which
led on to the lawn. The fresh night
air came in.. "That's rood!" sniffed
Jeremy.
Grantley stepped! Into the garden
with him and lit a cigarette.
"But is it all right. Grantley? Is Si
bylla reasonable now?"
"All right? Reasonable?" Grantley's
rnnermost thoughts had been far
away.
"I mean, will she agTee to what you
wishâ what we wish?"
"Yes, it's all right. She's reasonable
now."
His face was still Just In the light of
the lamp which stood on a table in the
window. Jeremy saw the paleness of
hi3 cheek^and the hard set of hl3 eyes.
There was no sign of relief in him or
"of anxiety assuaged.
"Well, thank heaven for that mccb
anyhow!" Jeremy sighed.
' ' "Yes, for that much anyhow," Grant
ley agreed, pressing h:3 arm in a
friendly way. "And now, old boy,
good-night."
Jeremy left him there in the rarden
smoking his cigarette, standing mo
tionless. His face was in the dark
now, but Jeremy knew the same look
was in his eves still. It was hard for
the .young man, even with the new
Impulses and the new sympathies that
were alive and astir within him, to fol-
Iojv, or even conjecture, what had been
happening that night. . Yet as he went
down the hill It was plain even to him.
plain enough to raise a sharp pang in
him. that somehow the little child, un
born or whether It shouid yet be bora,
had brought not union but estrange
ment to the house; not peace but a
sword. *

An hour before a dark figure had

through the increasing storm in the

was Dr. Weston. He had thought all

Barclay, looking up from his evening
"Why, I've been telling you for
twenty minutes that we must do some

"Not much!" replied her husband,
drawing the pretty young bride over
to his knee. "We're going to Point

After the pies had come out. the
plumpest pig obtainable waa popped
into their place, followed immediately
by a lusty, gobbler, and finally by a
chicken pie. In the meantime, atop
the kitchen stove, rutabagas, which
Mrs. Barclay called yellow turnips,
potatoes and onions were all to bo
cooked. Nuta from the woods back
of the house were to be cracked, and
in less than no time the young bride
was flitting busily about in a big
apron, helping as earnestly as if she
had known "Uncle John's folks" all
her life. Incidentally she gathered
these receipts:
Roast Pigâ Prepare the dressing for
the pig and the turkey together. Take
two pounds of dry bread and remove
all the brown crust, break it up into
a big earthenware bowl and pour tepid
water over it. Let It stand one min
ute and then, taking it up a handful
at a time, squeeze It hard and dry,
tossing It at once into another bowl.
Mix lightly with half a teaspoonful of
pepper, two teaspoonfuls of salt, two of
summery savory, two of sage or green
herbs mixed fine, a cup of melted but
ter and two eggs beaten light. Take
out the amount needed to stuff the
pig, and add to this an onion chopped
very fine-
Now take the pig, which has been
thoroughly scalded, rinse It inside and
out with clear water, wash the inside
with water in which a teaspoonful of
baklngr soda has been dissolved, and
rinse again in clear water. Wipe dry
with a clean cloth, salt the Inside and
"Aunt Jane,'-' exclaimed Mr. Bar
clay as they burst into.. the dining
room, "something: tells me you are

"John Henry," answered his aunt. In
grim tones belled by the twinkle in
her eyes, "something: tells me that all
the follies of city life ain't cured your
habit of nosing out good things to
eat."
Young Mrs. Barclay stood enrap
tured before the great oven built of
brick, five feet deep, three feet wide
and two feet high, yawning like a
cavern in the very walls of the din
ing-room. It was used but once a
year, in honor of the Puritan feast
day, and for days before all the men
about the place had been gathering
slabs from hemlock fences to feed
the flames. At this moment the oven
was filled with pies. Later it would

And so Mrs. Dlnsmore woke on that
crisp November morning to see a
glistening picture in frost work on the
attic window and to sniff the most
delicious combination of spicy odors
that ever reached her retrousse nose.
She could hardly wait to slide down
the steep uncompromising flight of
wooden stairs, jj

NEW ENGLAND THANKSGIVING DINNER
It was Thanksgiving. In Italy a gay
party of Americans had been charm
ingly entertained at their pension, for
the hostess had ordered their national
dinner, after which coffee was served
in the drawing-room of this one time
palace of the Caesars. It would seem
that every one present, in putting on
his evening clothes, had discarded with
his sack coat all everyday cares, and
the mercurial American rivaled in vi
vacity his Italian neighbor.
Milani's glance sought repeatedly to
fix the attention of Miss Holt; but
whether a perverseness born of In
ward coquetry or a real unconscious
ness made her avoid his could be
known only by a student of that pecu
liar piece of mechanism known as the
feminine mind, and even such an one
might profitably be reminded of the
Â«xpe<llency of the Frenchman's advice,
that in -writing of woman It Is an ex
cellent thing to reserve the right to
laugh at what one has written the day
before. With the slow, sinuous motion
peculiar to the sons of Italy, and which
betokens latent power and passion, Ml
lanl glided over to an animated group
of which Miss Holt was the center.
Obeying an irresistlblo Influence she
arose and went toward the piano. He
was at her side in an instant. Her
fingers swept the keyboard uncon
sciously, for the only sound she heard
was the musical tones of the man at
her side.
"Miss Holt, is it an American trait
to forget?"
Rallying a little from the hypnotic
influence with which his mere pres
ence charged the atmosphere for her,
Ehe replied with a nervous laugh:
"On the contrary, I was thinking it
peculiarly Italian. You seemed In no
hurry to claim the fulfillment of my
promise for the adventure we planned
some days ago."
"Get your wrap and let us hasten,
then, for it Is not safe to be out late.
The air of the Campagna is to be
dreaded at night."
They passed quickly from the lighted
rooms out into the beautiful night, and
Â¦walked in the direction of the Foun
tain of Trevi.
"Now tell me, truly, do you believe
that dropping a soldo In the fountain
lnsurts a return to Rome at some fu
ture day?"
"Surely you cannot doubt that, or
Â¦why should I be bringing you here?"
He turned suddenly and looked into
her eyes. His gaze set a thousand dif
ferent chords vibrating through her. It
was like a peal of clanging bells that
startled and surprised, yet left one in
doubt as to whether the effect brought
In Its train more pain than pleasure.
**I think you know why I am bring
ing you here. I love you."
The langour had gone from, him, and
his whole being was alive to the emo
tion that filled him. Her senses were
steeped in a sort of lethargy, and his
breath, as be leaned toward her,
eeemed to have been blown from a
field of popples.
/ Â» *^f P my father's best friend. Dr.
/ { West on, you have a warm
r"~1 place in my heart. But my
JL feelings are only those of
friendship; eo do not pain us both by
another such scene."
"Forgive me. Alice. I know I should
not be asking the old Question over
apain. But remember, you were a lit
tle thing when you crept into my heart,
and it is hard to tear you out. I shall
cot try. Keep the ring, will you not,
and wear it as before for vour old
friend's sake? Good by, and may heav
en bless you:"
Com Crrcsy Crow is the only

spr-m considerable time abroad. "At
the Fountain of Trevi" is her first
literary effort and is written from a
thorough knowledge of Italian life.
"Say it: 'I love you. Piperno,' " and
. ne repeated the words after him. The
mere sound of her voice saying his
name in soft accents intoxicated him.
"Promise me that you will not go
oack to your cold country; that we
will live together in our land of blua
sfkies."
"No, no â our love grew too quickly,
Piperno; it is only time that can prove
if it be really love. You dazzle and
fascinate me â you are so different from
our men at home! But I do not know
whether it will last, and until that
knowledge comes to me in a way that
cannot be questioned, I shall never
marry you. Where is my soldo? Now,
as I drop it in the fountain, I promise
to return to this spot and to you two
years hence."
His face was pale. He could not see
the reasonableness of her action, but
he felt, as he looked at her, that noth
ing would change her. And, after all,
she was well worth waiting for. So,
dropping in a soldo with her, he, too,
registered a vow to be there on that
night that now seemed rÂ»-reach so far
into the future. There was a chilliness
In the air which accentuated the gloom
that had fallen upon them- To throw
it off she said:
"Let me see the dagger you always
carry with you. Tell me about it
again."
"What, you mean my misericordi?
There is not much to tell except that
there is only one other like it and that
it belongs to my twin brother. Josefa.
They have been In our family since the
fourteenth century, and many super
stitions cling about them. See this hol
low place at the handle: it used to con
tain poison, and it Is said that when
these stones flash brilliantly it por
tends death to one of our family."
As he passed it to her she recoiled.
"Take It away quickly. They seem
to shoot fire now."
He took her hand reassuringly.
" 'Tls only your imagination."
The thought of their parting on the
morrow was with him and it took much
of the passion from him, leaving only a
gentle caress in his touch. He danced
at the dainty fingers, so clearly out
lined against his brown hand, and -saw
a ring sparkling on one.
"This must soon be replaced by one
which will be the emblem of our love."
"No, not replaced, Piperno."
"Is It, then, so dear to you? Why?"
"My father's best friend gave it to'
me â a man who loved me, and I wear
the ring because he asked me to."
His lover's jealousy was aroused.
"Swear that you will never care for
him."
"How impetuous you are! You
frighten me, but I swear it. Here we
are back again. Will you not come
in?"
"Not to-night. I could not be seeing
you with others. Here In the shadow,
come closer to me."
He pressed her to him In silence. As
she passed Into the warmth of the
lighted rooms she turned and waved
him a gentle adieu and he went back
to the Fountain of Trevi, to live over
again all that he had felt there that
evening. The fatal air, which rises late
at night from the fever marshes of the
Campagna, made him its target. It
aimed straight.
That night,- as he retired, there
mingled with his vision of a beautiful
woman the consciousness that the
glassy stones in his dagger were flash
ing fire.
In a lucid hour the patient said:
"Doctor, hand me that dagger. Yes,
I know It. I am going to die. How
long have I to live? Tell me, for it
matters more than the mere dying."
The physician hesitated.
"Answer me. The Milanis are not
afraid of death."
The exertion of speaking brought the
blood to the sallow skin for an instant
in two dull red spots, but the eyes were
wide open and fearless.
"You may recover, Mr. Milani; but
you may not live many hours."
The Invalid's hold on the bedclothes
relaxed and his eyes closed for an In
stant.
"Mr brotherâ oh, that Josef a were
here!" ,
"Can I do nothing for you In his ab
sence? Pray, command me."
It was Just two years since that
party of Americans had met together
for the last evening in the Palace of
the Caesars. The Italian sky was
For an hour or more she sat dazed.
Then, going to her desk, she sat down
and wrote the following: â¢
"This Is no time for maidenly
scruples. I once refused the love of
the best man I ever knew. But the
man who wrote those letters has my
heart. Shall we start over again?
"ALICE."
The beautiful girl looked up eagerly,
and seeing the handwriting which had
been familiar to her for a year, waited
till the maid left the roam before open
ing it, for she knew that it would con
tain the tenderest sentiments coupled
with such thoughts as could
emanate only from a mind
that had attained a high
degree of culture, and she wanted the
joy of it undisturbed by curious Â«Â»yos.
She had expected passionate protesth
tions of love from her Italian lover, but
instead of that he had so interwoven
his love with all that was highest and
best in art and nature that her love
and her noblest ideals seemed one and
inseparable. A smile played about her
lips as she tore open the envelope.
There was no heading.
"I have willfully deceived you for
twelve long months, and God knows I
have suffered so much that I am now
breaking my promise to the dead; my
only excuse was a base one. Your
lover, Piperno Milan!, died shortly
after you left Rome. I was summoned
to attend him. Having no one else, he
told me of his love for you and begged
me to keep his death from you, which
I finally consented to do. Love of you
wrecked my life and he died thinking
only of you. Yet I can not practice this
deception any longer. I do not ask
your forglvenness. I have acted like a
madman. I had learned to do without
you, but your letters, breathing so of
yourself have brought back the past,
and, .heaven help me, I love you still!
"JOHN WESTON."
A heavy fogr hung over San Francis
co. It served but to increase the ap
pearance of luxurious comfort of the
Holt home on Pacific avenue.
"A letter for you, Miss- Holt."
"Such a slight deception can matter
but little. It is a dying man's request."
And the eyes already, with a look not
born of earth, turned toward him ap
pealingly.
There was a long pause, and the de
mons of revenge and jealousy alter
nately asserted their sway over the
physician. This woman, or love of her,
had ruined his life. This dying man's
thoughts were not of the world he was
about to enter, but of her. -Was it -not
right that she, too, should suffer. He
merely said: *
"I promise you."
Milani's hand clasped him as in a
vise.
"My daggerâ bury it with me."
He fell back exhausted, and the color
receding from his face left It a deathly
hue.
"I cannot do this thing for you." The
physician's voice in dissent aroused
him. â¢
"No; go on." . â¢
"She is to return to Rome and to me
in two years. She has sworn it at the
fountain of Trevi. But she wears an
other man's ring. I cannot let him win
her. She must not know that I am
dead; you understand, doctor, she must
not know! For two years she shall be
mine. This is more than a sick man's
fancy. Promise me that you will write
to her for me, and then when it is time
for her to come to Rome tell her I am
dead."
"What is your name? Weston? Ah,
I remember â the American physician!"
He grazed at him steadfastly for an in
stant. "Yes, I will trust you. Doctor,
I have a strange tale to tell you and a
stranger request to make, and not
much time or strength left in which to
do it. I love. Yes, here on my bed,
facing death, I still love, and it ,1s the
only thought that fills me. She is your
countrywoman. Her name is Miss Holt,
Miss Alice Holt. What is it? Are you
faint?"
The sick man hesitated. His keen
gaze was searching the physician's
face. . .

Nature stories, which had their vogus

Thompson Seaton (or Ernest Seaton

been Justly open to the attacks of Â¦ the
parodist. Bom* of the most extrava

have made the thing a faroe by their

Frederick Stansbury, who wrote "A
Klttlwake of the Great Kills," Is one
of these extremists or he Is * very
clever parodist. I am inclined to tha
latter opinion.
The first story of the author's col
lection is one of those typical lachry
mose rehearsals of the woes of a poor
little bird whose life had been harassed
by wicked hunters. At first one is in
clined to believe that tho author really
does belong to the Audubon Society,
but when he speaks of "the little
widow," meaning the bereaved kittl
wake, the doubting reader begins to
detect a Bly wink in the author's-rhet
oric. Then again he tells a story of
a magpie that used to crawl In bed
with the writer every morning and lie
there on his back perfectly contented
while the covers were pulled up be
neath his bill. And then another story
about a little xnousle that lost her rea
son and ate up all of her hopeful
progeny.

Two recent additions to H. M.Cald
well & Co.'s very tasty Red Letter Li
brary are "Poems by William Cowper"
and "Poems by Robert Herrlck," both
edited and prefaced by an introductory
note by Mrs. Alice MeynelL These
handy pocket volumes in red limp
leather, and thoroughly artistic typo
graphically, constitute one of the most
pleasing features of the year's serial
publication of standard literature.
In brief comment upon one of these
volumes n.ote may be taken of Mrs.
Meynell's estimate of that dull drab
poet Cowper. Bhe finds in this poet
one whose natural desire to soar Into
the high realms of exalted posey was
curbed and squared off by the literary
fashion of the times. "And we must
read him," says the critic, "with the
fact present In our mind that no pas
sion was then looked for in poetry, that
no half-thought, no speculation, no
groping, no hesitancy, would have been
tolerated, that no word not in the best
epistolary or conversational use would
have been admitted." Mrs. Meynell
further finds, however, that the heart
which had to voice itself in moderate
phrase and careful exactness was a
human heart, stirring with Intensely
human â¢motions. ,
Wen, after all, the poet who could
writs "To a Sofa" and "On Mrs. Mon
tague's Feather Hangings" only under
the repression of the reigning style In
rvrw may have been capable of better
things,
(H. M. CaldweH & Co., Boiton.)
Miss Knapp Is a close student of the
laws behind the springing of the grass
and the bursting of the bloom, but in
her appreciations of the aspects of
nature she seeks to find, rather, the
poetry that is in every growing thing
and to strike harmonies out of creation
to which the soul of man may make
answer "The keener our realization
of the human love that is in the flow
ers, in the trees, in all the wild life
about us." writes the essayist, "the
richer is our humanity, the fuller our
reception of life and love, the more
thoughtful our use of all the things of
nature becomes."
The publishers have . given "Upland
Pastures" a form well fitted to the

Dr. Mitchell has had paid to him by

compliment which rarely falls to a
writer of fiction. His recent book,
"Now Samaria," la made up in a large
part of an account of the experiences
of a man who threw himself upon the
charity of such of his fellow men as
he chanced to meet In the highways
and byways. For the purpose of his
Btory, as well as for the enforcement
of his Idea, Dr. Mitchell was obliged
to create a situation improbable in it
self. This fact has been universally
recognized by the critics, but likewise
there has been almost universal agree

which Dr. Mitchell has outlined is eji

This would seem to bear upon the
old question as to whether the fact
that a writer knows his situation to

"The -' Masquerader" is one of the
most keenly constructed etories pro
duced In many a month. It is a story,
pure and simple, with no ethical sig
nificance, no didactic ends to be sub
served. Upon the plot, remarkably
unique and developed through baffling;
turns of circumstance, hangs every
thing. Despite the fact that already
readers have been raising mooted
points of ethical contention and moral
conviction anent the author's solution
'of the puzzls in her novel, the truth
remains that this is a story, only, a
story to amuse; all speculation con
cerning the ulterior purpose of the book
is decidedly beside the mark, for thers
is none.
The author has founded her dot
on impossible premises and worked it
out to a logical conclusion. Given two
men of an exact Identity, the one a de
generate under the clutch of morphia
but possessed of a high position, the
other unknown yet the master of arreat
potentialities for action; they chance
places, each entering upon the sphere
of individuality held by the other;
what results are possible? Mrs. Thurs
ton has conceived of results as one
could never guess at. Building; up one
complication after another, following;
one situation with another, perfectly
logical but equally unexpected, she has
constructed a tissue of circumstance
whose every turning brings surprise
,and a feverish desire to gain the next.
The mechanics of her story building
are perfect, yet so concealed as to be
manifested only through the super
structure of even incident which they
support. , â¢
Two lines of interest divide the
suspense of the reader. John Loder,
the man who has usurped the Identity
of the degenerate Chilcote, finds that a
crisis in the foreign policy of England
thrusts upon him opportunities for
putting into play faculties for leader
ship that are madly beating; within
him. Through the seat in Parliament,
which he holds by virtue of his assump
tion of the part of the degenerate Chil
cote, he is enabled to mount by leaps
and bounds to the heights of ambition.
Yet how unstable his foundation i a

of boundless opportunity for surprise
for the author. A situation of some
delicacy, very like that in which Stev
enson's Davy Balfour found himself
with Margaret In the Lowlands, calls
for the author's neatest Ingenuity.
Satisfying Is hardly the word of sum
mation for "The Masquerader," for

be in dissatisfied unrest because of the
fact that he will probably go far be

In the preface (dated April 23.

speare." now Issued in a separate vol

brigandage which may not be gen

"The manuscript of the 'Life' was

1901, and from the beginning of June
to the middle of September was kept
in a safety vault at Cambridge. In
October it mysteriously disappeared
from my library. Though I had lit

evidence was" purely circumstantial;
and for that and other reasons it was
Impossible for me to make any effort
to regain possession of it. The person
who took It intended, after reading it,
to return it without betraying himself,
but he was afterward tempted to put
it Into other hands with a false state
ment of its history, possibly with a
view to its being utilized, in part if not
as a whole. In print. This can hardly
be done with safety, but it has com
plicated the affair and interfered with
the return of the manuscript in time
for it to go to press as promised. I
have therefore been compelled Xo un
dertake the depressing- task of rewrit
ing it, and the present volume Is the
result."
The first edition of 50,000 copies of Mr.
Larimer's new book, "Old Gorgon Gra

Self-made Merchant to His Son." was
placed so quickly that the second edi

we believe that an Increasing sale will
attend this book, which recounts, for
the first time, the real essence of Amer

marks for a single book when for the

And how is one to get time for books
when the struggle for existence hardly
leaves a moment of leisure? Men think
of the existence of books either In rail
way carriages or â in bed, when they
desire to fall asleep with the least de

"the attitude of the publishers toward
scientific men arid authors Is one of
chilly indifference, even of scornful con
tempt. To them everything is stale, an
tiquated, uninteresting, superfluous.
Everything has been said; everything
has been printed and consigned to the
storeroom. A book which can count on
no more than a total sale of three or
four thousand copies is rejected by pub
lishers as a hopeless proposition. They
will not put it out at their risk, even if

/TpHOMAt? MARC PARROTT of the
3 chair of English literature at
Princeton has produced a book of
critical essays upon some of the mak
c:p of English classic literature and
their masterpieces which merits atten
tive reading by all Ftudents of the best
that is in our belles lettres. "Studies of
a Dooklover" he calls his volume. Eight
random critiques upon the character
and literary influence of his several
eulijects comprise the sum of his work.
Pi*orcFsor Parrott approaches his task
not from the standpoint of dogmatic
conviction or carrying the assumptions
of a controversialist; en the contrary,
he but attempts to bring upon common
subjects of literary knowledge the per
sonal interpretation of a close student
and a booklover. He would find In the
well-worn aspects of literature some
new and refreshing thought to broaden
our conceptions of the esthetic value of
the classics.. He would likewise give an
insicht Into the personalities of the
great writers as reflected, consciously
or unconsciously. In their works.
"The Poetry of Matthew Arnold," the

poets is Arnold, according to Professor
Parrott's estimation; didactic also In
the powerful expression of his phllo
eophical conception of life. In his ap
preciation of Arnold as a lyric poet
Parrott departs somewhat from
accepted belief In claiming
classic excellence for his sub
ject in that metier as well. "I
believe the time will come," says the
Â¦writer, "when critics will not only rec
ognize In Arnold's lyrics the loveliest
flowers in his garden of verse, but will
pronounce any anthology of English
lyrics incomplete which does not con
tain more than one or two of these
priceless blossoms of pure poetry."
In the light of this claim it is difficult
to justify Parrott's admissions of Ar
nold's palpable faults. He lacked al
most entirely richness of color and ap
preciation of tuneful words, according
to this commentator. He was deficient

THE ' SAN FRANCISCO SUNDAY CALL
FROM
THE
BOOK
PRESSIN the case of a large Thanksgiving
gathering, the hours which follow
directly on the heels of dinner pre
sent a problem for the hostess.
Naturally the elder prefer to sit
quietly and chat about family affairs
which have arisen since the. last an
nual gathering; but not bo the young
people, who desire more attractive
forms of entertaining. The wise hostess
will plan amusements for the children
and young people, bo that their elders
may be left In peace for an hour's con
versation.
As soon as the dining-room is cleared
of all signs of the feast it can be
changed into a play -room, and some
older girl should be elected as mistress
of ceremenies and should plan the
games so that the children are amused
quietly until the elaborate dinner has
been digested.
A pleasing little contest for children
is laid out on kindergarten lines. Two
bowls, one containing big white pop
corn kernels and the other cranber
ries, are placed at their disposal, with
a supply of toothpicks* threads and
needles. The children are then re
quested to make some article or dec
orative design in the white kernels
and the red berries. It is remark
able how quickly the children will
seize upon the idea and what fetching
little ornaments they will produce.
Toothpicks, run with cranberries and
joined at the corners with popcorn,
will make a frame to lay flat on the
table and inside of this a child will
block out a picture in red and white;
or, strung on the thread, they can be
wrought Into red and white tassels,
balls and odd shaped ornaments, such
as are been on Christmas trees.
The second game is a trifle more act
ive and is merely a variant of the old
pame of pinning a tall on the donkey.
In this case a sheet is fastened against
the wall and on it is drawn or pinned
a representation of a turkey. A tur
key, drawn in colored crayons and then
cut cut and pasted carefully on the
sheet, {rives the best effect. In the old
denkey game a tail was provided and
did service for all the players, but for
the turkey game the housewife may
provide real turkey feathers, saved
from the gobbler which was served at
dinner. Each child is given one of
these feathers and a long pin; then,
blindfolded, he is- started toward the
sheet in search of a proper place to pin
the feather.
If the paper turkey has been pasted
on the sheet it is a comparatively easy
matter for a blindfolded person to feel
around until the bird is discovered,
but It is not so easy to find the exact
spot on %vhich the tail feathers snould
be pinned. As a result, when all have
taken a turn, the turkey is liable to
have tails sprouting in every direction,
which of itself will create fun.
The mistress of ceremonies must keep
track of the game and award the priz-3.
which can be a papier-mache turkey
filled with small candies, to the child
whose feather strikes nearest the mark.
For the third game, start the chil
dren in search of cranberries which
have been hidden all over the room.
For this purpose provide each child
with a small basket of wicker or
crepe paper, and have the cranberries
hidden before the guests arrive . be
hind ornaments, in the crevices of the
table legs, behind pictures, on the
upper sashes of the window â in any
place which will tax childish wit and
ingenuity. When 1 the voyage of dis
covery is over the cranberries can be
counted, and a small prize, such as a
crepe-paper basket, filled with crim
son-coated Jordan almonds, can. be
awarded to the child who has found
the most berries.
By this time the heavy dinner will
be pretty well digested, and the chil
dren will be glad to go for a run out
of doors or a skate on the pond if,
fortunately, the family gathering be
in a country where ice forms early.
If these names be too childish for
the young people who have reached
the ajre of fifteen or more, the hostess
will do .well to plan some formal en
tertainment for the evening, which
will be riven under the direction of a
college girl or boy versed in the
handling of amateur theatricals. This
will afford an afternoon's entertain
ment, for the young people will-need
to be drilled for the evening perform
ance. Even in this blase age, young
people from fifteen to eighteen thor
oughly .enjoy getting up a "show."
New England poetry has suffered
an eclipse, and school boys and girls
of to-day are not so familiar with its
beauties as were their fathers and
mothers. It will, therefore, be some
thing of a novelty if the hostess ar
ranges a 'Dhanksgiving evening with
Longfellow, presenting living: pictures
from his poems dealing with New
England home life.
In preparation for such an entertain
ment she must have a few stage set
tings and costumes. A fireplace or
mantel will do for the background of
most of the pictures. A settle or two,
some old-fashioned chairs, dishes and
a spinning wheel will also be useful.
For costumes, paper, muslin or calico,
in black, gray or dun color, can be
worked cheaply into the Puritan cos
tumes, together with wftlte kerchiefs
and caps for the women, made from
tarletan or tissue paper; and for the
men. there must be broad-brimmed
hats with cone-shaped crowns, made
from- black canvas, and â¢ white turn
over collars. Shoes with Â¦ buckles and
long, black hosiery are worn by the
men, with knickerbockers fulled in at
the knees. The cloak is round and
stiff, and, indoors, a doublet to match
the .knickerbockers Is worn! The
dresses for the women have no trim
ming: except a fichu.
If time is allowed for, making ; the
costume, and some member of the fam
ily is deft at cutting and planning, a
very respectable stage wardrobe can
be produced at the cost of a couple of
dollars.. If the performance is given in
double parlors, folding doors may be
used Instead of curtains; and the ef-
At the commencement of thÂ» sec

sit and muse," curtains fall for a
few seconds, and very quickly & young

On the words, "ThÂ» picture fades,**

a quick change to a gray or brown

of the table, the ; young man at the

as it is depressing, and the seventh
scene, presenting the golden wedding,
will make a much more attractive tab
leau. As an encore (applause is bound
to follow) the two old people may be
seated alone in the settle, just as- they
were in tableau No. 2, but now wear
ins white vriga. They are bent with
age. but she still sits with her head
on his shoulder, his arm about her
waist.
The success of this evening's enter
tainment will depend entirely upon the
heartiness with which the young peo
ple enter into- the spirit of the scenes.
If refreshments are served after the
performance, they should be the typi
cal Thanksgiving dainties served in
New England households â cider, apples,
popcorn and pork fruit cake, or a spicy
gingerbread to which raisins and cur-
tors offer their pantomime, interrupted
by the messenger, also in Puritan cos
tume, who brings word of Standish's
death. The curtain falls on the two
lovers plighting their troth.
The picture from "Evangeline" is the
famous betrothal scene of Evangeline
and Basil, starting "Indoors, warmed
by the wide mouthed fireplace. Idly the
farmer sat in his, elbow chair." The
curtain rises to show Evangeline and
her father seated on one side of the
fireplace, the old man smoking his
long pipe and the girl spinning. As
the story progresses, Basil, her lover,
enters and in pantomime he follows the
reader's recital of the uprising of the
colony. Then enters the notary wfth
a quill pen and his seals to witness
the betrothal. While the two old men
talk In pantomime the younjr people
are seen to withdraw toward the win
dow, where they stand, the younff *irl
clasped In her lover's arms; and the
curtain falls on another. familiar quo
tation:
Silently, one by one. In thÂ« Infinite meadows
of heaven.
Blossomed the lovely atari, tha forret-ma.sota
of the angels.
. In planning this Bet of pictures the
hostess will find many hints in the po
etry which will tell her what proper
ties will be needed to set forth the
scene, such as tankards, lamps and so
forth.
"The Hanging of the Crane" pre
sents the most pleasing possibilities
and gives the children something: to
do. The poem' should be read in its
entirety, and the tableaux should be
changed quietly and rapidly, so that
the speaker's â¢ voice is not drowned
by the noise .behind the scenes. The'
first picture shows a young man ' alone
before the fireplace, in which/ has
been hung a huge black crane, which
may be built from wood or paste
board and stained black. He wears
the Puritan garb and holds rather a
sentimental attitude in the firelight,
which can be simulated by the use of
red paper with an electric light be
hind it. , '- , -
feet of the living pictures will be
heightened if on the side of the door
next to the actors is stretched theatri
cal gauze, which is not expensive, and
gives the . effect of distance to the
tableaux.
Three sets of pictures may be pre
sented â the first scene from the famil
iar story of "The Courtship of Miles
Standish," the second may bet scene
from "Evangeline," and the third, par
ticularly suited to a family gathering,
should be "The Hanging of the
Crane." As the latter is laid rather
on the lines of dissolving views, a cur
tain of dark stuff, which can be drawn
and dropped again quickly, will add
to the effect. These .living pictures
may be separated by music â a number
of Longfellow's poems have been aet
to melodies. "The Bridge," ''The Ar
row and the Song," "The Rainy Day,
"Excelsior" and "The Open Window"
can be found in the cheap collections
of old-fashioned songs.
The first scenes from "The Court
ship of Miles Standish" will be found
under the heading of part III, "The
Lover's Errand," and part VIII, "The
Spinning: Wheel." The setting for this
should be very simple, with Priscilla
Allen seated at the spinning wheel. Be
fore the curtain rises some one who
has been selected as reader or reciter
is heard back of the scenes, starting
with: "So through the Plymouth
woods John Alden went on his er
rand." When he reaches the line, "So
he entered the â¢ house," the curtains
rises slowly and shows John Alden in
the doorway, his hands filled with
flowers. The actors do' not speak, but
as the reader tells the story they act
in pantomime the memorable proposal
by proxy, ending with the famous ex
pression: "Why don't you speak for
yourself, John?". .'
While the curtain is down the reader
recites 'the opening stanzas of ."The
Spinning Wheel," ' and at the words
"So as she sat at her wheel." the cur
tain Is raised. to show the second woo
ing of John Alden, and again the ac-
braided down~tne Ijiujk lend themselves
best to the Puritan costume.
The costumes of the men are most ef
fective when made from chocolate col
ored paper, -with knee breeches and a
round cape. White ruching or pleating
may be introduced at the neck. Black
paper should be used for the shoes
stockings and broad-brimmed, cone
shaped hat. The men carry high, Ira
pressive looking staffs. A good qualitj
of library paste will give better results
In dressing the dolls than the use ol
needle and thread.
Small imitation pine or cedar trees,
which can be bought in boxes of a
dozen each at Email cost, will add much
to the attractiveness of the centerpiece.
They are made In wood or paper mache
and painted bright green.- and they are
most effective when seen through the
snowdrifts. They should be lightly pow
dered with the sugar snow.
Such i. presentation of the first
Thanksgiving celebration was made at
an actual cost of $2, Including the
sugar, and it was an elaborate affair
at that. The cost can be. reduced if
there is a boy. in the family clever with
his knife and hammer, who could build
a little cabin from twfgs. Holes can .
cut for doors and windows and the lat
ter filled in with isinglass or curtains
made of white tissue paper. In the
doorway can be stood a motherly look
ing doll with a drab or chocolate col
ored drefes, white fichu and cap.
If this presentation impresses the
housewife as being: too subdued in col
oring she can change it entirely if she
is willing to sacrifice the old fashioned
spirit. The cabin can be built from
the long, very slender sticks of candy
which will take the place of the logs,
and which can be secured in many
bright colors, and the dolls may be
dressed in the crepe paper to match
the gay little cabin.
In this case the cabin should be filled
â¢with bonbons, or the French mottoes
containing tissue paper favors. These
are attached by gayly colored ribbons,
which run through the chinks of the
candy log cabin and extend to the
AFTER THE THANKSGIVING DINNER - WHAT?
â¢* y EXT to the age and condition of
/ \ I the turkey, no one item of the
I N Thanksgiving dinnerso agitates
\Â» the housewife's mind as does the
decoration of the dinner table. In the
homes of the wealthy, sterling silver,
sparkling cut glass and choice exotics
nave become identified with the na
tional feast day, but where the old
fashioned, homelike spirit still prevails
mere externals cuunt for less, and the
home maker tries to study out a
scheme of decoration suggestive of the
clay and its spirit.
Her purpose will be more than accom
plished if she draws the younger mem
bers of her family into the pleasant
task; and if she will employ for the
centerpiece on the Thanksgiving din
ner table a representation of the first
celebration in Massachusetts she will
surely find young hands eager to assist.
In this scheme the decoration may
be used with either a bare table, or
with the ordinary damask covering;
but it will show to better advantage
ir' the uncovered, highly polished table
is used.
The foundation for the first Thanks
giving celebration in r iniature is a
bank of pulverized sugar or fine table
EaltJ as large as the size of the dinner
table will permit. This bank may be
square, round or oval, according to
the shape of the table, and it should
be arranged in drifts, rising to a prom
inence in the center. Pulverized sugar
'drifts" better than the salt.
On top of the central mound or prom
inence should be set a small log cabin.
It can be bought in sections, ready to
set up, for one dollar, and when in po
sition it stands fully a foot high, with
perfect doors and windows. Shredded
cotton batting can be stuffed into the
top of the chimney to simulate smoke;
or a small pan holding a preparation
of nitric acid and a.iur.onia, which any
druggist will prepare, can be set insida
the cabin and lighted, and real smoke
will issue from the chimney without
any flame, odor or danger of fire. At
irregular intervals among the drifts
dolls dressed in Puritan costume should
be set. These dolls may vary in height,
but should not be out of proportion to
the size of the cabin-
The simplest and most effective ma
terial for dressing the dolls is crepe
paper in white, drab, pale chocolate
color and black. The skirts for the
women are plain and full, and over this
is hung a round, full cloak with a hood
in the back and a fichu issuing from
beneath in the front. The white cap for
the hair is made with a flare or on a
modified Dutch pattern, "with the front
turned back like a fold and fitting
smoothly around the face. The cap and
fichu are of white and the dress of the
drai or chocolate color. The white cap
may be worn alone, or the hood from
the cape may be drawn up over the
white cap. Little dolls with fair hair

plates. Arter dinner eacn guest pulls
a ribbon and as the cabin falls down
it discloses treasures within which are
carried away as souvenirs. .
If the real log cabin is used as a
centerpiece the plate souvenirs may be
small log cabins of pasteboard, which
can be bought in stores which deal
exclusively in favors. They are stamp
ed on bristol board and must be cut
out and set up. They can then be
filled with small candies.
Plate cards and souvenirs go far to
ward breaking the ice when guests are
taking their places, as they furnish an
immediate topic of conversation. If
a permanent souvenir of the day is
desired for each guest then sweet
meats and bonbons are to be avoided,
and the young girls of the family may
use their deft fingers.
As Thanksgiving is presumably the
feast of all good things, fruits and
vegetables suggest themselves for
favors. At those invaluable shoes for
prudent housewives, the five and ten
cent stores, can be bought small silk
and velvet pincushions made ud in the
form of almost every fruit or vegetable
that grows; or they can be repro
duced by clever fingers in silk, velvet
or crepe paper. If velvet or silk is
used, when the cushion is finished the
initials or the monogram of the guest
can be set in with pins.
If the table is rather small in pro
portion to the number of guests to be
entertained, such souvenirs may be in
the way, and a pleasing and convenient
device for distributing favors is the
fairy chrysanthemum ball. r*
This is made .from paper chrysan
themums in the gorgeous autumn col
orings, and in the heart of each some
little souvenir is hidden. The stems
of the chrysanthemums are tied with
baby ribbons, which, in turn, are
lightly woven or pleated together until
the mass of chrysanthemums looks
like a large ball, from which the
braided ribbons dangled. A single
strand of ribbon is used to tie the
chrysanthemum ball to the chandelier,
and the individual ribbons attached to
the flowers swing like a canopy from
the ball to the various places at table,
where they may be fastened under the
plate with a pin. "When the coffee ia
served each guest Is permitted to pull
his ribbon, and the ball separates Into
individual blossoms, each going to the
guest for whom the souvenir was in
tended.
Where many children are present the
popular "Jack Horner" pie. built from
crepe paper and chrysanthemums in
the autumn cole-rings, always creates
amusement and pleasure. The pie may
have a lid which lifts off and discloses
appropriate souvenirs for the guests;
or it may be filled with paper chrysan
themums used for the same purpose.
Souvenirs should be selected to hit
off some fad of the recipient. For-ex
ample, the boy who has yearnings for
automobiles should receive one in min
iature made from aluminum or compo
sition metal. These come In sizes no
bigger than your thumb at five cents
each, and there Is a small whistle In
the hood of the 'automobile. Hansom
cabs, sulkies, bicycles, musical instru
ments can be bought by the dozen In
assorted styles In the same wares.
The girl who can make clever draw
ings with pen or pencil can hit off thÂ«
fads of her guests much more aptly.
These drawings may be made on plain
calling cards and tied to a single chry
santhemum bloom, which Is, after all,
the really effective plate card.

the cowboys across the street brought
up memories of past experiences and
his eyes had begun to grow troubled
and full of apprehension. At length
he stopped and looked back; but It
was too 'ate now. Several of the cow

as he turned, they swung into their

Sound refreshing sleep and good

not conducive to perfect rest, so I
would suggest that you begin reform in

WHITE SPOTS ON THE NAILS
(Nellie). â The' numerous white spots
on the finger nails result from bruises
which need not necessarily be severe;
the careless handling of household or
toilet articles will quickly develop
these blemishes. If they have appeared
in greater numbers since beginning a
regular system of manicuring the nails,
I am convinced that you are applying
the steel' file with too great vigor in
pushing back, the skin around, the root
of the nail. Substitute an orange wood
stick for the purpose, as there is less
danger of bruising the nails; always
hold the finger tips in tepid water for
five minutes to soften the cuticle before
attempting to push the skin back. If
the nails seem very thin and are sensi
tive to pressure, get a mixture of tinc
ture of myrrh and refined pitch at the
druggist's and smear a Bmall quantity
over the spots before retiring, protect
ing the bedding and your clothes by
wearing old gloves.- In the morning
rub sweet oil freely over the nails and
in a few minutes the, pitch will be soft
ened and can be rubbed off with 1 a soft
cloth. Then wash the hands and polish
the nails in the usual way. Repeat the
applications of pitch and myrrh until
the spots disappear, which may be in
several days or weeks, according to the
nature and size of the bruise.

CARE OF THE TEETH (J. B. L.).â
Unless you are a confirmed invalid it
is nonsense to say you are too nervous
to endure dental work; it is unavoid
able, so meet it bravely and do not ud
set the dentist by hysterical outbreaks.
While no sane person denies that work
on the teeth is both painful and
tedious, like many other ordeals "of life
a vivid Imagination magnlfles^the an
ticipation out of all proportion to the
substance of the actual. Unsound
teeth induce extreme irritability, ner
vous and stomach troubles incident to
Improper mastication, hence their
preservation and repair Is imperative.
Avoid needless exposure to either heat'
or cold, for both/extremes are injurious
to the enamel on the teeth, even
though no acute sensation be felt.
Moderately soft brushes ' and
preparations free from grit used faith
fully each day will prolong the useful
ness of teeth almost indefinitely, al
though there are, of course, rare cases
when the teeth are constitutionally
frail and preservation 1b impossible.
The hue of the teeth is also largely a
matter of bodily vigor, those teeth
with a slightly yellowish cast belnc in
dicative of â¢ strength. - 'An excellent
liquid dentifrice which will harden the
gums and; preserve the teeth is made
of a mixture of one quart of hot water,
one and one-half ounces of borax, one
teaspoonful of tincture of myrrh and
two teaspoonfuls of spirits of camphor.
Add the borax to the hot water . and

Just what such a girl is thinking of
Is somewhat of a mystery to me. Every
man hates boldness and loudness, and
he cannot be bluffed into thinking he
is the only one. and that the little ex
periment was tried to see how the
thing would really work. Such an ac
quaintance- may be all very well and
goodâ for a half hourâ but the quiet
little lady who is never heard or seen
on the street is the one be goes to visit
and invites to the theater the following
evening. No one, either man or woman,
considers it a compliment to be ogled,
and, as a consequence, ' waste little
time and no respect jan those whose
chief pleasure Is to attract attention
and to attract it any old way. Â¦; Â¦
The girl who flirts in this fashion is
something like a bull in a china shop.
The mere fact' that she stoops to such
tricks proves that there is something
radically wrong with her somewhere,
and that "something" Is Just the very
thing that all masculinity infinitely
prefers to see in some other man's wife.
To be sure, every mother's -son will
swear and declare that the "Jolly good
fellow" Is the woman of to-day, but let
him catch any of his own family cut
ting up the self-same capers, and it is a
horse of another color. He may not
even be aware that his sister is an
adept at relieving awkward situations
nnd saving the day every time, but he
does know if she is making a spectacle
of herself and resents it in a fast and
furious manner.
Every woman Is more or less of a
flirt, but the clever one is she who dis
covers her strong points and then
makes the most of them, for the sim
ple reason that they are both becoming
and alluring. It stands to reason If a
/ woman wins a man by prettiness and
coquettlshness she can hold him in the
same manner, but -too many wives con-
sfder it' valuable time wasted, and the
very thing that was most admired is
thrown aside as a valueless weapon
that had outlived Its usefulness.
CLEANING FINE BRASS (Bessie).â
The girl who views with, dismay the
fleeting beauty of her pretty candle
sticks and other articles of brass
should know that the labor required to
keep them brilliant Is not so formida
ble as it appears when a number of
tarnished articles have accumulated.
The time-honored preparation of salt
and vinegar for cleaning brass is unex
celled, and so inexpensive that it is
within the reach of every one. The pro
portions are one teaspoonful of fine
factor in ridding the body of unwel
come tissues, hence sedentary habits
and an occasional leisurely stroll
must give way to brisk walks and
vigorous exercise which wlli brine all
the muscles into use and send the
blood bounding through the veins.
Lack of regular and sufficient exercise
brings, besides fat, a host of evils In
its train, while physical training
strengthens the muscles, the body re
sists fatigue and the brain is clear and
alert. Exercise during the cool early
hours of the morning is best. If
postponed until night and hastily per
formed the routine is merely a farce.
Golf affords the most exhilarating
pastime, although rowing or tennis are

(M- N. B.).â The clever woman knows
it Is useless to attempt to wear all her
clothing, which was prepared early, the
entire summer and still look present
able at the close of the season; so, to
avoid looking conspicuously passe, she
manages in this manner. At least one
handsome thin gown is kept in reserve
or a new one is made up during this
month, when pretty fabrics are being
sold at such low prices. If the goods
are wisely selected and the garment
well made it will do for all informal
affairs at home during the winter. Ba
tistes, nets or fine mulles are always
safe to choose- It is false economy to
wear a faded hat; nothing looks quite
so forlorn on a warm day as faded,
dust-stained finery; less should be
spent on v gowns if nee*. be, but a smart,
fresh hat and veil are imperative.
Shoes arid gloves can always be kept
In perfect style and condition, regard
less of the season. For little journeys
into town from the country, or for a
day's Jaunt to the seashore, a modish
tworpiece walking suit of linen or mo
hair is ideal, worn with a dainty shirt
waist of white. Elaborate silk waists
should be sent to the professional
cleaner and worn places concealed by
fresh trimmings. Cotton waists and
gowns which show breaks in the lace
or embroidery should . be carefully
mended before laundering. Discard
crushed ruchings, faded ribbons and
the like, and replace them with new.
Remnants can now be bought for small
sums and. they are Just the thing for
late summer renovating. Just a word
about the purchase of new ribbon^trim
xnings. Select a softer shade than that
originally used on the garment, so that
the harmony may be better in case the
waist or gown has faded some, as it
probably has. To be more explicit, al
ways match ribbon to the garment, not
to a new piece of the fabric.
HINTS FOR THE STOUT GIRL
(M. R. L.).â The girl who has lounged
about on shaded verandas all summer
until obesity Is threatened must chanse
her regimen. Activity U tho principal
THE girl w ho flirts is one of the'
most trying creations that ever
disturbed the peace and tran
quillity of mankind. She is all
powerful, for there is a subtla
something about her that is not only
absolutely irresistible but absolutely
irrepressible as well.
Every man likes a coquette, but there
are flirts and flirts. And there is a vast
difference between the two, let me as
sure you. The lasFie fair who cannot
use her eyes, manipulate her fan and
.smile a smile that means whole chap
ters has been deprived of a certain
part of her "finishing" education. In
fact, there is something radically
wrong with the woman who has not
some instinct of the flirt in her, for it
is absc-iutely and entirely feminine.
There are scores of girls who are
neither beautiful nor witty, but they
are natural born coquettes, and as a
consequence are perfection in the aver
age man's eyes. The beautiful girl
generally banks on her face being her
fortune, but the coquette cultivates the
habit of saying pretty, flattering
things, studying the trick of amusing
half a dozen men at one and the same
time, and of making each, man think
he is the one that is being especially
favored.
Such a woman need not be called a
flirt in the popular usage of the word,
but she is the most dangerous of her
kind. She weaves her spell quietly and
ckillfully and has landed her game
high and dry before he discovers what
she is about. And so adroit has this
exceedingly modern girl become that
nine and ninety times he never realizes
that he has married a flirt, for she
keeps up the romance of life and takes
care to see that the fire on the hearth
stone of love never grows gray and
dull, to finally die out.
This wholesome coquette Is a radiant
being and she sheds her happiness and
sunshine wherever she goes. She
doesn't go about with a chip on her
ehirulder, because it iÂ£ part of her game
to win people over to her side by being
Jolly and genial, and she soon discov
ered that deeper and more subtle im
pressions could be made by tickling a
man's pride than by wounding his van
ity. For woe be unto the unfortunate
who deliberately hurts a man's feel
ings. He immediately erects a barrier
end crawls behind it to smart and burn
afid grow more indignant every min
ute, and it takes an immense amount of
battering tu even so much as weaken
his defense in spots.
The most popular girl is the one who
Is gracious at all times and all places,
for every one feels that her sweetness
has been showered upon them and that
the day is a little brighter in conse
quence. She has either discovered by
chance or been endowed by Providence
that it is just as easy to hand a cup of
tea with a smile and a bewitching lit
tle l'm-so-glad-to-do-this nod as it is
to assume, a haughtiness that is intend
ed to snub. Of a truth, It's far easier,
for every one bows and succumbs to a
radiant, sunshiny smile, and crowd into
their shells Just as fast as they can
when a sudden dash of cold hauteur is
seen coming their way.
This kind of flirting is perfectly per
missible, but when it passes beyond a
certain boundary it is without the pale
of polite society. It is one thing to lift
the eyelids and lower them quietly and
effectively, and quite another to give
glance for glance in a cold, calculating
way. It is quite different to walk down
the street gracefully in a long skirt and
picture hat and to attract attention for
one's sweetness than it Is to mince
along fn ridiculous French-heel stilts,
displaying a bewildering array of fluffy
fluff-fluffs and permeating the air with
the newest and strongest perfume ex
tracts.
The ordinary flirt, so to speak. Is just
about the most obnoxious thing ' on
earth â that Is, of course, the girl who
makes it her chief business in life to at
tract the attention of every one on the
street and who delights In chance ac
quaintances. She may have been well
reared, but there Is a spirit of unrest
about her, and she excuses her follies
and foibles to herself and others by de
claring in a vehement manner that she
"won't be hampered by conventionall-
ties."
On her way to the matinee she talks
to the man who happens to be Just be-
hind her. and while she does not do It
at the tip-top of her lungs he under-
Btands perfectly well that much of it is
for his benefit. Later on she lets her
eyes rove about from seat to seat, and
when she discovers him at last she tries
a thousand little acts to attract his at
tention, and then demurely eyes him
over the to? of her programme. To all
outward appearances she Is a lassie of
gentle voice aod gentle actions, but
those dancing eyes, that follow bo flat
teringly and so persistently, are the key
to her character. Outside the doors she
contrives to drop her handkerchief, to
loosen her violets â In fact, to do any
little Innocent thing to gain time, and
the man who would hesitate to walk
well-directed efforts and particularly
so if you are fortunate enough to have
an available room with windows on at
least two sides. A model bedroom, is
arranged on these lines, and the cost
may be very moderate or not according
to individual means and taste. A
charming and highly artistic color
scheme is formed of the soft, gray
green of the cornflower foliage as a
prevailing color, with touches of dull
blue and pink of the blossoms with
creamy white gilt and a mere touch of
black. The side walls are papered In
plain restful green, with traceries of
gilt in the frieze, which is also a deli
cate blending of soft dull pink and
cream, where it merges Into the soft
creamy green of the celling paper.
Over the wax- finished floor Is scattered
two or three small rugs In green and
dull blue hue, which can be taken out
and shaken daily. The windows are
without draperies, shades and blinds
moderating the glare of light. "When
there are no blinds on the house,
screens, made for the lower sash of art
netting, which suggests a stained-glass
effect and at the same time excludes
inquisitive eyes and summer Insects,
are very pretty. The management of
the bed is a triumph of allâ it is just a
simple, single bed of brass or enamel,
with dainty fittings, cool and spotless.
A mattress elastic enough for perfect
rest and pillows of correct size; no
thick down or cotton-filled quilts, but
light blankets. Instead of standing the
bed in a corner its weight and size will
permit it to be pulled about the room
at night in whatever position desired.
Only necessary furnishings are toler
ated, useless trifles are conspicuous by
their absence and thus the labor of
caring for the room is reduced to the
minimum. At first such a room may
seem stiff and bare, but as soon as you
discover how deliciously comfortable
and dustless it is I am certain you will
be delighted with the change.

"DEODORIZING A SICKROOM (Mrs.

would announce in loud and solemn
tones that the wages of sin are death,
as though that had anything to do
with it.
Having given a faint, far . away
glimpse of the peculiarities of Dio
genes' makeup we shall give our gen
tle readers â we never admit any
other kind â three guesses at that
gentleman's occupation. He might
have been a preacher, except that he
wasn't. A really good preacher usu
ally finds out before he haa been In
the game very long that human na
ture is liable to error and that the
man who starts out on a campaign, of
stone throwing Is likely to discover
before nicr'nt that what he thought
was a solid steel-arched roof over hl3
head is only glass, and poor glass at
that. Perhaps Diogenes was a' law
yer? Guess again! You don't catch
a lawyer who understands his busi
ness doing or â¢' saying anything to di
minish the average annual output of
crime. We won't say why this Is so;
the mere statement of the sad fact
must suffice at the present moment.
The last try Is that he was a doctor.
Wrong again!
Since everybody glve3 it up we shall
have to answer the question ourselves.
Diogenes J. Browna was an operator
on Wall street, who made his living
by selling questionable stocks to peo
ple who were too foolish to ask the
right kind of Question. He not only
sold watered stock, but he adulterat
ed the water. In his hours of leisure
he devoted himself to the building up
of. an establishment In Jersey for the
manufacture of patent medicine which
was warranted to cure anything from
cold in the head to cold feet; from
liver complaint to tuberculosis of the
hair. The principal ingredients were
plne-tar for flavor and old shoes for
body. .
Diogenes may or may not be aware
of any discrepancy between his words
and his acts and It doesn't make any
difference to us whether he is or not.
The fact which we have been en
deavoring: to "establish is that the pop
ular conception of honesty depends on
the scale of a man's operations and
whether or not he i3 caught and that
afellow-feeling instead of making us
wondrous kind often makes us act as
though we were of an entirely differ

against the sacredness of property
should be punished severely.
Diosrenes'a favorite newspaper took
a high moral stand on all such ques
tions and whenever it recounted with
grim satisfaction the fact that Slippery

fessional inmate of Sing Sing, and
other resorts, had been found treading
in his mother's footsteps and had

school book idea .that .", the boy who
starts In life by extending, his surrep
titious sphere of influence to include
the., outlying portions of his â¢ aeigh-
bank or hold up an express train. As

While we have been satisfying the
pertinacious Individual on the back
. c eat Diogenes J. Browne has been
waiting patiently in the winge. â¢ Wo
shall now continue our' lecture. Dio
genes took the position that the only
thing this country needed was more
and better honesty. If this country
were suddenly to receive all the only
things it needs It would be ready for
the kind offices of the undertaker and
the sexton. Fortunately for the .rest
of us the men who know exactly how\
the Government should be saved never
get a whack at it. Our purpose in pass
ing In our usual hurried but graceful
manner over the principal events in
Uie lifp of Diogenes is that we. may
show in what manner the quality of
honesty may be strained.
A great hobby with Diogenes was
attention to trifles. The' descent to
Avernus is not only quite facilis,. he
fTfHE immortal Shakespeare, or
| some other man of the same
1 name, is our authority for the
J^ statement that- the quality of
mercy is not strained. We men
tion this matter at this point merely
by way of calling attention to the fact
that the same things cannot be said
of the quality of honesty. In
fact, some of the latter Is strained so
fine that, there is little left of the
original composition. There are as
many different kinds of honesty as
there are people working at It. Some
people are so honest that they are
afraid no one will find out about it
and therefore they are willing to go a
mile out of their way to explain how
unnecessarily scrupulous they are.
When you meet a man like that you
had better hold your watch with one
hand and yell for a policeman with
the other. Then there is the other
kind of honesty which makes a man
afraid that no one will discover how
big a rascal he is. In such a case you
will be safe in wagering that most of
that man's wickedness consists in get
ting leave to print.
We might run on in this way in
terminably, which would be quite a
while, if It were not that our fell In
tention when we began the collection
of these few choice thoughts was the
revealing of the true inwardness of the
life of Diogenes J. Browne. Mr.
Browne was a Capitalist, with a large
C. If there is any one present who
objects to our devoting so much of our
valuable time to the problems of the
vulgar rich, that person Is hereby In
formed that we are fond of speaking
of the things which we understand and
"that If there is one thing we know all
about It Is the woes and shortcomings
of the capitalist. Haven't we walked
down Wall street many a time and
oft? WÂ«ll then!
oi the use, enjoyment and, ultimate
disposition of a man's own property
in his own way. -Things had come
to a pretty pass,. he thought, when a
man could not .be sure of wearing his
own overcoat or carrying his own gold
headed cane for more than two days
in succession. All such offenses
would point out, but the slope begins
very gently and In a manner not cal
culated to arouse the suspicion of any
one. The young man who begins by
doing the street railway company out
of the 6 cents coin of the realm which
is lawfully due it for services rendered
is. In a fair way to grow up to rob a
bor's orchard is in a fair war to per
ish in a vile dungeon, if not on the
scaffold. . In a voice that quivered
with righteous indignation he would
lecture the young culprit on the enor
mity of the offense, especially, if it
happened to be his own orchard in
which . the youngster was surprised.

on the woman's page. On Saturday
night she gave him a dime for a. shave,
and when he came back with a mani
cured face she sat him down to 'a small
keg of beer In the kitchen.- The keff
was all his. Â¦ Many a night I loitered
with him until the keg yielded nothing
but bubbles. Beer did not appeal to

hours he drank â¢ from f the pail and

of his early, days in England, all of
which was, of 'massive' interest to me.

By and' bv ,when the keg arid stock
of anecdotes ranrdiry. she' helped her
man to bed, where ihe< shook the roof
bellowing 'the songs of his youth until
he fell asleep." Hel had tolled and
IN the course of one day I recovered
from tie Jar occasioned by female
duplicity in the restaurant: forgot
all about it in the great good for
tune of becoming not only an em
ploye but a boarder In a large city like
Orcaha. That was hustling some for a
half-baked kid away from home the
first time. My Job lay in a foundry on
the outskirts of the town, and the boss
laolder. moved to pJty by my youth
fad Innocence, took me to live In his
own select family at the rate of four
acÂ« cotes per week.
My roommate was the Irish rentle
rr.aa who chopped up and melted the
pi* iron at the foundry, and wÂ» were
very good friends Indeed. When we
entered the boudoir together It was
necessary for one of us to crawl under
the bed. In order to make room for
closing the door. Still, I enthused over
my advancement In life. It Isn't often
a mere t>oy can become a boarder and
send out twenty cents* worth of laun
dry nearly every week.
Next to politics and the practice of
law fcundry work is the dirtiest Job I
know cf, but the money Is clean, and
the mclder carries with him that re
spect which Is one reward of honest
effort. Moreover, the unplugged pores
of the worker in molten metal filter his
conscience. He can sleep at night and
eat several pounds of liver and bacon
at 5 o'clock In the morning. To be sure,
this talent doesn't make him rich. He
seldom endows colleges and race tracks,
but he Is healthy and happy, and that
helps some.
The reason I'm able to blow so much
hot smoke on this subject is that the
iron foundry was my alma mater. My
education â good enough what there is
cf it, and plenty of It such as it is â
Broken walls and roof and window
less windows for smoke and heat to
escape in summer and to admit the
cold in winter. Clammy earthen floor,
piles of black, sand, huge gibbet
cranes, with rasping chains and open
molds; great pots of liquid iron swing
in the air, spluttering furnaces that
ehoot constellations of hot stars and
eulphur fumes into the dull atmos
phere, heat that cracks the skin, ex
plosions of gas and choking vapors,
half-naked figures groping and steam
ing â hell with the lid on.
So fervid Is the zeal of youth that
all this was but the limelight of fame
to me, and the dirtier I got the more
popular I was with myself when visit
ing friends of the owners came in to
look at the employes. Sometimes I
wondered what those persons would
say if they Knew I boarded with the
boss. But that was too much to hope
for so earlv In the game.
From candle light in the chill win
ter morning until casting time in the
evening I molded the iron framework
for modern school desks, then coming
into vogue. Thus did the memory of
precious hours wasted at school come
back to me, and I shoveled sand with
increasing ardor to make up that lost
time. The man next to me worked
under a crane, the gearing of which
did the heavy lifting. He made large
iron arches to support the whaleback
masonry in sewers, and I envied the
greater quantity of sand he handled,
with the expert aid of a polish helper.
Frequently Y nen visitors were
around I went over 'and leaned on the
crane in picturesque attitudes and a
pair of overalls, just as if the hoist
belonged to me and was about to
strain Itself lifting the top off one of
my dinky molds. A dopey old age
makes me long for th* foundries of
my youth but, alas, they are gone.
Once I gloried in my open pores, but
now I beef because they boost my
laundry bills.
Not the least exciting Items in my
curriculum were the home and social
Bides of life in Omaha. I found both
pleasure and comfort in the home circle
and plunged into all the gayeties that
came my way. The foreman, with
whom I lived, "was an Englishman, and
his three sons had followed in hi3 foot
steps to the extent of being Enclish
and molders. One of the sons â a bov
of my own age â had trouble with his
vocal chords. He thought he could
sing, which suspicion was shared by
the entire family.
At noon we all went home to dinner.
For that meal the mother Invariably
fcet out to each man a robust Ensrlish
meat pie, or pasty, baked in a crust.
â¢ Our habit was to eat all we could, bite
our monograms on the top crust, and
inherit the same pasty for supper. So
thoroughly was this system maintained
that during a period of four months
I do not recall a single fight at supper.
s
was amassed In those Institutions,
scattered over an area extending from
Maine to California and from Canada
to the Gulf. At one time all foundries
looked alike to me, and it was a source
of great pleasure and some food to be
Identified with one. Any old building
will do for a foundry. .
Each boarder got what was left of
his own pasty, besides other thinÂ«rs,
and if he didn't care for the pasty it
could be placed on file and carried over
to another meeting under the head of
unfinished business.
In "other ways this good wife and
mother knew "|ow to make home at-
tractive. She held the finances, laid in
the provisions and kept her husband
at home on Saturday, night by a scheme
more fascinating than any yet touted
dose by the stove. He talked shop,
and I liked that.
Attired in shirt sleeves and slippers
tho old man sat stiff-backed and alert,
with the keg lying'on a chair In front
of him. One hand held a short-
stemmed garbage burner, and In the
other he supported a half gallon tin
pail with one horny finger hooked
over the rim. His patient wife stood
by bearing a fistful of pipe lighters
made of twisted paper, for the oracle
gotten, and the .tales rolled on until
time to fire up again. Â¦. ' ' ,
When I think of it now that woman
was a marvel. She actually delighted
In turning tho spigot, and stoking the
pipe, and she knew the stories even
better than he, having heard; them
often enough. Sometimes Mommer
coached Popper when he started -a
yarn in the middle or left out an im
portant paragraph. If It were a
funny story she gave me ray cue to
their ammunition back by reaching
Into the shattered panes.
In the mldat ot th2 battle the woman
fell back on her wrongs and burst into
noisy tears. J*hat was Popper's cure,
and, in a voice that dulled the storm
outside, he said he was a ruined me
chanic.
"Disgraced and bulldozed in my own
home, what have I to live for?" howled
Mr. Thomas. â¢â¢Nothing whatsoever. I'll
end it all!"
Tearing off his coat and,hat, the out
raged parent and provider, pale with
the resolve of death by hl3 own hand,
lunged out of the house and slammed
the door.
"Help! Save him â Lewellyn, com*
back!" wailed the wife. "Oh, he's
killing himself. Help!!'
All hands hustled to the rescue. Tha
gentleman who boiled the plglron, two
molders boarding there, one son-in-law,
three grown sons and myself comprised
thÂ« party. We found Mr. Thomas
standing in a drift surrounded by tha
blizzard. One leg, slightly in advance
of the other, was bent at the knee, and
his arms were folded across his chest
In the ghostly light of the storm he re
sembled Mr. Washington standing In
the bow of the boat the night that hero
crossed the Delaware. Snowfiakes fall
ing on Lewellyn's hot bald scalp melt
ed, trickled into his hair and froze. His
flowing: side whiskers . retained the
snow, with lace-curtaln effects, until
his face presented a birdseye view of
a parlor window.
"Don't touch me," Mr. Thomas said.
in hollow accents, as tho rescue party
closed in. "I'm freezing myself to
death."
"Oh. Lewellyn, don't do It," bested
the wife. "Come In by the flre. like a
good man."
"Xever!" hissed Mr. Thomas. "I
freeze to a corpse right here. Fare
well."
Turning so that the blizzard smote
him in the teeth, the suicide waited for
the end. I was appalled, never having
witnessed violent death In any form.
But ere his gentle spirit fled two sons
fell on Popper from behind. The rest
tackled him all over, and in a few min
utes the back yard was cleared of
snow and Mr. Thomas. Snatched from
the brink of the grave and bestowed
by the fire, with the loving arms of his
wife about him, Mr. Thomas shed some
sloppy tears.
He had been cruelly abused In his
own home, but bore no malice. Fortcet
and forgive was his motto, and Lewel
lyn made good by falling asleep and
forgetting that he ever lived. All this
happened so long ago that I forjret lust

With desperate fear at her heart,
Mrs. Thomas shoved her man Into a
corner and searched him. He yielded
nine cigarsâ five of them broken and
the rest bentâ and one half-pound can
of 6almon, with a picture of the fish's
face 'on the can, like that of the man

bang-up time on Saturday â¢ night at
trifling: expense. , He got tanked, did
all the talking: and pulled oft a lot of
goreless mind fights. And during the
spree and when it wound up Mommer
knew where he was, just what he had
been doine: and she had the weekly

her business.
This system made a deep dent" In my
tender Intellect, and. I resolved if des

and become an Ideal toiler. But so far
there is nothing doing. I don't smoke,
. and the man in the white Jacket turns
the spigot for me.
One Saturday night following a snow
fall of three feet, and in the height of
a blizzard of exceeding fierceness, our
gentle landlady sprung a charley horse.
Rheumatism put "her out of the domes
tic game for that evening. Popper
Thomas said he would take a chance
with the storekeepers, so with a list of
verbal instructions covering one hour
he was sent off to do the marketing.
With his side whiskers neatly curried
and the light of noble resolve shining in
his eyes my boss departed, carrying
two baskets and one $10 bill. It was
long after midnight when the shopper
returned, minus the baskets, but bear
ing a Joad that was a peacherlno. The
success of his expedition to busy marts
.#>of trade awoke me and the rest of the
employes and aroused startled interest
in the neighbors.
Every item but one Mr. Thomas had
purchased was concealed under his belt.
, yet. we knew the exact nature of his
contents. His face was adorned with a
beatific smile and two unlighted cigars,
,with red and old gold corsets on them.
' Mr. Thomas never used cigars except
on special' occasions, at which time he
became, a real sport. Removing one of
the cigars, my . boarding boss shifted
the other hard a-port and started to
warble a plaintive ditty about a bloom
ing sparrow that crawled up a bloom
ing spout.
The lady Â¦â¢ of the house grabbed the
shopper and shook him.
"Is this the way I brought you up,"
she demanded. "Trained you by the
kitchen fire, with your keg and your
pipe. Where's the money, the groceries

The beauty and enormous size of the
fuchsia bushes of Kylemore have ex
cited the admiration of all who have
ever visited the neighborhood. The late
Queen Victoria admitted that they ex
celled anything of the sort she had
ever seen in her travels, and she made
several unsuccessful efforts to introduce
the species Into the royal gardens at
Windsor and at Buckingham* Palace.
Queen Alexandra has just had one of
the bushes brought bodily from Kyle
more, and the Duchess of Manches
ter's own gardener has come over to
see it planted -at Sandringham.
The gardener, like a large section
of his countrymen, is possessed of the
popular superstition that Irish-grown
plants cannot flourish in English soil,
and he frankly told her Majesty that
he could hold out no hope of a success
ful experiment in this case. Asked by
her Majesty why this particular spe
cies should not flourish at Sandring
ham the old gardener answered, "Suje,
your Majesty, there's more virtue in
the rocks of Connemara than there i3
in all the fine castles of England."
at Rufford Abbey his host and hostess
treat him much as 1 an ordinary guest
while still observing those points of
etiquette which are always associated
with royalty.
At most places where he is enter
tained a gorgeous flunkey Is at every
door through which he is likely to
pass, to open It for Mm with a pro
found obeisance. At Rufford he is al
j lowed to open doors himself, and can
stroll . about the house or the grounds
without having it thrust upon him at
every, turn that he is regarded as a
special object of reverence and adula
tion.
It is Sir Alfred Jones' prominence In
the movement that more than anything
else inspires the confidence of the Brit
ish public in its ultimate success. He
has a record of never making a failure
of anything he has undertaken. He
owns some Welsh collieries which he
found were not paying. He installed a
new plant at great expense, but the re
sults speedily compensated him for the
outlay, for he saved 75 cents on every
ton of coal mined. He called it bring
ing himself "up to date"â a favorite
phrase of .his. He has. been dubbed the
"Banana King,". though his success in
developing that industry in the West
Indies and the Canaries is really one
of his minor financial achievements. It
is now freely predicted it will not be
long before the title is superseded by
that of the "Cotton King."
Enormously rich, at the head of five
great steamship companies and several
minor lines, he is in no sense a money
grubber. He Is a man rather of the
Cecil JRhodes type, with whom money
is a means to an end, and that end the
development of British trade and com
merce. '
He. is 54 years old and wedded only
to business. .His gospel of success he
tersely summed up as "Work, hard
work," and he practices it far'better
than he preaches it, for he is a man]of
few words.
Sir Alfred Jones has not done milch
talking about the Eritish Cotton Grow
ing Association- heretofore, but ,> the
other day he made this significant ut
terance: "We have got through now
with the preliminary process and diffi
culties, and are rapidly approaching
results which are likely to astonish the
cotton world."
soil is said to be well adapted to cotton
culture. If only one-tenth of it were
devoted to that purpose at the rate of
one-thirjj of a bale to the acre, it would
yield 10,000,000 bales. Cheap labor is
abundant. A conservative estimate of
the population of West Africa places
it at 20,000,000â in Northern Nigeria
alone there are supposed to be at least
10,000,000 natives.
CONFIDENCE IX LEADER.
only hope of getting steady work and
full pay at their trade in the future.
THE 3HX AT THE HEAD.
At the head of the association is Sir
Alfred Jones, one of the brainiest and
most energetic of England's self-made,
captains of industry. As proof of his
own confidence in the British empire
cotton growing undertaking he has
bought 60,000,000 acres in Sierra Leone
and started raising cotton there on a
big scale.
Under Us energetic direction the as
sociation has dispatched agents to spot
out all the likely places in the empire
where cotton can be raised and made
to pay. Large . consignments of cotton
seed have been distributed. Machinery
has been purchased and sent where it
is needed. Expert cotton cultivators
have been engaged, several of them
from America, to show the natives the
best methods of raising cotton. Many
asmples of cotton have been received
from agents of the association that
Lancashire manufacturers have pro
nounced good and some of it quite
equal to the American product.
As a result of all that has been dona
thus far it Is confidently asserted that
in England's possessions all the cot
ton needed for her mills can be raised
and as much more as the rest *>f Eu
rope may need. Indeed, one enthusi
astic member declared that America
would some day be importing cotton
from British colonies.
RICH FIELDS IN VIEW r .
The latest reports of the association
gives a long list of places in the Brit
ish colonies > and dependencies where
cotton is now being grown, or can be
grown. It is . being raised in Malta
and Cyprus in Europe. In Asia, as is
of course well known, it is extensive
ly cultivated in India, but it is also
grown in Ceylon, in the Straits Settle
ments and in North Borneo. In the
Western Hemisphere it is grown in the
West Indies, in British Guiana, in Fiji
and in Australia.
In Africa cotton has long been a sta
ple product of Egypt and is now being
cultivated in earnest in the Soudan.
At Kassala, at Sennaar and Shendi the
planting will be extended as soon as the
Suakim-Berber railway is completed.
Cotton can be grown in many parts of
South Africa, such as the Lydenburg
district, Swaziland and Basutoland.
It is grown In Natal and in the Guama
River district of Cape Colony. . It flour
ishes in Rhodesia,.in British Central
Africa and in Uganda In various
districts. On the West Coast it is cul
tivated in Lagos, Sierra Leone, in Gam
bia, on the Gold Coast, in Northern
and Southern Nigeria, also in Mauri
tius and the Seychelles and in St.
Helena. \
HOPE IN WEST AFRICA.
It is in Africa, and more especially
in West Africa, that the British Cotton
Growing Association expects to en
throne another King Cotton who will
some day rival the American poten
tate. In this district the inhabitants
have been familiar -with the growing,
spinning, weaving and dyeing of cot
ton for centuries â before William the
Conqueror had invaded England. It is
one of the beneficent results of the
oirly spread of Islamlsm, which
taught the virtues of cleanliness and
clothing, besides closing the gates of
Paradise against those who get drunk.
In Mohammedanized British West Afri
ca the weaving of cotton is universal.
Notwithstanding the primitive nature
of the looms, some of the cloths pro
duce*, it is declared, are so beautifully
finished as to defy European compe
tition. But owing to the "care lavished
on their manufacture they are much
dearer, even there, than the imported
Lancashire article. In the great city
of Kano, the "Manchester of Africa,"
with over 100,000 inhabitants, the cot
ton industry plays a leading part and
the same is true of many other centers
of Northern Nigeria.
The total area of the British posses
sions in West Africa amounts In round
figures to 500,000 square miles. The
Thus it has come about that the Lan
cashire folk have "waked up." That
awakening ha? borne fruit in the or
ganization of the British Cotton Grow
ing Association, which has for its ob
ject the promotion of cotton culture in
the British Empire. It has made pro
vision for a fund of $500,000 to carry
on the work. Although the cotton
spinners have had to work for months
on short time, one of their associations
has contributed over $5000 to the fund,
bo convinced are its members that in
the success of the movement lies their
The world's present production of
cotton has been estimated by a Lan
cashire expert at 16,000,000 bales, of
which the United States produces 11,
000,000 bales; India, 3,000,000; Egypt, 4,
000,000, and the rest of the world an
other 1,000,000 bales. In ten years from
now. figuring on the normal increase
â¢jf consumption, it is predicted that 19,
uOO.-JOO bales will be required to keep
the world's Fpindles busy, and in flf
iccn ycarr 23,000,000 bales. That the
United States can come anywhere near
Eatiifytns this demand is considered
impossible. In fact, it is asserted that
v.ith her own' population rapidly grow
ing and her own mills increasing, her
surplus for export must inevitably de
crease.
Lancashire's great industry has been
worse hit by the short supply and high
price of cotton than is generally real
ized in America. According to the
latest estimates the various interests
concerned in it have lost over $50,000,
ftOO in the last twelve months. Experts
have done a lot of figuring on the out
look for the future and they have all
reached the same conclusion. It is that
if England continues dependent on the
United States for the bulk of her cot
ton her colossal Â»cotton- manufacturing
Industry, which directly or indirectly
gives employment to 2,000,000 people,
will be ruined, and that at no distant
date. It would.be a national disaster
almost as appalling as the loss of her
colonial empire.
LANCASHIRE'S AWAKENING.
Some of the Lancashire cotton man
ufacturers will probably accept the
hospitable invitation of the Southern
manufacturers to visit them and talk
thing* over. They and their hosts will
find themselves in genial accord on a
good many things and especially as to
the desirability of hanging the stock
gamblers, who get up corners in cot
ton. But the bulk of the cotton men
tm this side scout the suggestion that
they can best find a way out of their
troubles by lending a hand to increase
the area of cotton culture in the South.
WILL VISIT IN A5IEIUCA.
There has been much talk about
British cotton for years past, and
hints have been pent out from time to
lime that the movement was possibly
a bigger affair than had been realized
in the United States. And now there
i* no longer any doubt about it. Be
fore many years it ;.<$ predicted the
British colonies will be turning out al
most- as much cotton as the United
States and much of it of equal quality."
The demand is increasing so much
faster than the supply, .however, that
it is thought that the only effect in
the United States of the new British
movement will be to prevent corners.
In normal years the English manu
facturers import $200,000,000 worth of
the raw staple, the bulk of which
comes from the United States. They
believe that if the new scheme con
tinues ae well as it has started, it will
r.ot be more than ten or fifteen years
before they will be able to get on
without a penny's worth from across
the .Atlantic.
LONDON, Nov. 1?.â Dan Sully ar.d
tho others of his kind seem likely to
have a bigger mark on the world's
history than one would naturally sup
pose. For at last, as a direct result
of American speculation In cotton, the
Iiritish manufacturers dependent on
the American product have gone seri
ously to work to raise cotton enough
to supply their own mills.
Another house which the King will
probably visit soon again is Rufford
Abbey, the Nottinghamshire .seat of
Lord and Lady Saville. He recently
told a friend, and that friend told oth
ers, why he finds a charm in Rulford

LONDON, Nov. 19. â The announce
ment that the King and Queen will
visit Mr. and Mrs. Willie James at
West Dean Park, Chichester, this
month is regarded as an exceptional
mark of royal favor, for It is a most
unusual thing for the sovereign and his
consort to be guests of a commoner at
the same time. A few months ago the
King spent a week-end with this pop
ular couple and the Queen wa3 enter
tained by them when she was the
Princess of Wales.
Of course Mrs. James plays an ex
cellent game of bridge. She is also a
clever amateur actress and shares with
the King his fondness for Â¦ yachting.
Mr. James, by the way, is of American
descent. - -
LONDON, Nov. 19.â It appears that
the rich and costly furniture which
the late proprietors of Kylemoro left
at the castle when the estate was trans
ferred to the Duke of Manchester is
not good enough for the American
Duchess. She has given instructions
to a firm of Dublin auctioneers to clear
the lot out and sell it at what it may
fetch without a reserve price. The fur
niture is early Victorian and the
Duchess finds that it does not har
monize with the scheme of decoration
which she has decided on.
The best furnishing houses in London
and Paris are now being drawn upon
to refurnish the castle from floor* to
ceiling, and it is estimated that thi3
alone will cost a fortune or as much
as the Duchess intended originally to
expend on the whole transformation of
the castle. The scheme of decoration
is white and pink and the furniture
will have to be made especially to suit
this. The same scheme will obtain in
the new house which the Duchess has
acquired in Grosvenor Square, London,

were present visitors from many of the

was exemplified in a manner that was
perfect, and under "good of the order
all the grand officers were called upon
to speak. On that occasion the grand
president made one of the very best
speeches she has ever delivered before

parlor presented to Mrs. Caminetti a
beautiful crystal perfume bottle, an
elegant decorated crystal bonbonniere
to the grand secretary and a bunch of

Friday in November, was a very in
teresting one. There were present
more than 200 members of the order
and many of the great chiefs. The
work of the evening was performed
with that promptitude for which thia
council is noted, and then followed the
adoption of thirteen of thirty elected
palefaces. This was by the councils

commended. The comments of the
great Pocahontas were compli
mentary, and her address, in which
she told of many official visits she had
made outside of this city, was in .not
only an interesting manner, but onr>
that proved that she is a close ob

PROFESSOR CHARLES MILLS QAYLEY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, THE AUTHOR OF "THE STAR OF BETH
| LEHEM," A MIRACLE PLAY COMPILED FROM EARLY DAY DRAMAS AND RECENTLY PRESENTED WITH MUCH
I SUCCESS AT BERKELEY BY BEN GREETS COMPANY OF PLAYERS.
"Both," Professor Gayley promptly
replied. "Rather, though, we would
turn* out Shakespeares and Sheridans.
I do not wholly admire the pessimistic,
realistic, 'dirtistic' drama. I don't think
we are all going to the 'demnition bow
wows.' I recognize, of course, the bril
liance and momentary persuasiveness
of the plays, but they leave a bad taste
in the mouth."
"If it happens to be truth and art â "
"Of course, it is not the purpose of a
work of art to teach," Proressor Gayley
granted, "but it must rest upon some
vital ethical underpinning, mustn't
it? The problem play is usually as one
sided as the sentimental drama of the
'Old Homestead' type. The world isn't
made up simply of these problems. I
"Do you think the university en
vironment, training, useful to the dra
matist?"
"Yes, to a certain extent," the pro

a very necessary acquaintance with

practical work of such sort as thisâ
modernizing Marlowe's 'Edward II,'
and such like â which was the kind of
thing I set young Tully and Elmer
Harris doing. You know them? I hope,"
he* went on, "to see the tone of college
p'.ays vastly lifted before very long.
Certainly they are better now than
they used to be- We shall have to

eh?"
"Do you hope to make Ibsens or
Shaws here?" I asked.
"What do we hope for in drama
here?" Professor Gayley repeated, stop
ping his walk and looking over at the
gray roofs that cover who knows what
of youthful ShakespearesI "One
thing," the professor began â and I
knew that it was the one thing in his
scheme .of thingsâ "is that some time
soon we*may hold here a dramatic
competition every year, in which stu
dents, alumni and professors of the
university shall all take part. It shall
include every variety of legitimate
drama, and the prize shall be the
staging of the play by the university.
* â¢ * Maybe then we should get once
in five years, say, a great play. Un
doubtedly (he material is here, and I
can think of no better plan to arouse
it into activity."
"For dramatic contrast, too, I took
the liberty of alternating the kings and
shepherds â rich and poor â as they
brought their gifts to the Christ-child.
The old play is very sweet in that
scene. Mary says the child is cold, and
Joseph lays him among the beasts and
folds him in his arms to warm him.
Very pretty, very pretty. * * * Of
course, none of these old plays is suf
ficient in itself to hold a modern audi
ence. There are perhaps ten or twlve
incorporated in 'The Star of Bethle
hem." "
I asked then about the Boston per
formance of thÂ» play. Boston, it seems,
had taken it very seriously. Mr. Greet
and his players had produced the play
there first and it had been very suc
cessful. Modestly Professor Gayley
showed me a few Cf the Boston wise
men on the subject. He liked, particu
larly, I noted, the Boston Transcript's
dictum, that was eulogistic in its usual
conservative fashion.
"What is the kind of thing dramatic
that one may expect from the univer
sitiesâthis university?" I hazarded
then.

This afternoon the new Tivoli re
ceives its baptism of grand opera â a
great event. What the old Tivoli has
meant to us In operatic history we
all know. What the new Tivoli may
mean we can only surmise. So far it
has meant nothing. Curiously this is
the first Tivoli year, for many years,
without a season of grand opera. Yet
one feels that Mr. Leahy has not been
unwise therein. One has felt so sure of
the grand opera, year by year, that
gratitude has been rather forgotten.
With the better and better perform
ances given more and more has been
demanded, and only In the lack of what
we had so freely Is It felt just how
much was so handsomely given. We
shall be very ready for next year's
season, Mr. Leahy, and meantime are
glad that a Tivoli year shall not go by
wholly withbut grand opera.
This afternoon's performance is of
"Lucia," and has the particular inter
est of introducing in the title role
Madame Fannie Francisca, who has
won so favorable opinion in the part in
Europe. One is particularly glad of the
opportunity to hear Madame Francis
ca in opera. Her introduction in con
cert was not fortunate one felt, so es
sentially dramatic is her instinct. At
any rate the singer brings to her work
a voice even wonderfully beautiful,
pure, full, flexible, sweet and of a tim
bre peculiarly fine and. rare. The Ed
gardo will be our old friend, Russo, and
one knows him happy in the role. The
cast is also fortunate in its Henry Ash
ton, that will be sung by Signor Bor
ghese, and Signor Wanrell has the part
of Raymond. Then the orchestra will
be importantly augmented for the oc
casion, and the chorus â well, one wants
nothing better than the Tivoli chorus.
Altogether the performance promises
to be one of exceptional interest. They
have been working like beavers at the
rehearsals, and with Mr. Steindorff at
the baton there is little to fear as to
results. Come to think of it it is a
rather extraordinary condition of
things when an end of the world place
like this can produce a conductor, cast,
orchestra, stage manager at a mo
ment's notice for the production of a
grand opera like "Lucia," and in the
fashion in which it is surely going to be
produced this afternoon at the Tivoli.
Well, every one is to be there appar
ently, to rejoice at the Tivoli's grand
opera christening. This afternoon, at 2.

"That kind of thing should inter
est," the professor began.
"Ethically, and from the literary
sideâ"
"But I think you will find the scene
as a whole not uninteresting dramati
cally," he advanced then. And I did so
find it the day after. Its quaint silli
ness I found delightful, the sheep steal
ing by one of the shepherds, whose wife
cradles the sheep as a new born babe,
and the heavy, naive humor of the
colloquy between the thief, his wife
and the ehpherds. It is, of course, pro
foundly suggestive from the historico
dramatic side, as Polonius would say,
and net less from the literary view
point.

"Why, one of the fellows is a regu

laughed, and instanced the following
very up-to-date grumble of Daw, one

value as contemporary entertainment,
and as aforesaid expressed the opinion
that it would at least interest the

myself I idly wondered if the hundreds

of Madame and Monsieur Mark Mur

laugh for the last time to-night with
"Th*> County Chairman" really cared
whether George Ade did or did not de
scend from the author of the "Secunda
Pastorum." In short, I wondered what
the popular appeal of "The Star of
Bethlehem" wouid be, and had asked
for its compiler's opinion.
"I really think the shepherd scene

began. "The humor, philosophy Â¦*
"Philosophy?"
Th<> professor, tall, loosely suited in
easy pray, was walking: about, hands
behind him, as he talked. Every now
and then he turned a keen and humor
ous brown Â«*ye my way, or stopped his
tramp to hand over some quaint old
English drama to illustrate a point.
He talks easily an<i picturesquely, and
is not at all afraid of a little of the
modernist of idiom which be slang.
Frofessor Gayley is, further, delight
fully un pedagogic, neither spells his
1-atin nor translates his French for

complimentary knowledge in the other
person.
"It should. 1 think," Professor Gay

compilation of plays of the nativity,

novelty of a professorial adventure
into playwriting had tempted me to in

the drama, and I was a class of one in

Miss Laura Kinze von Kisielnicka,

The young woman, who Is a contralto,

taken in the event. The singer will be

Curiously, one of the numbers on
Miss Williams' programme, played
at Mr. Tolmie's studio, was the
Haydn Andante. Oppositely from the
Brandt reading, Miss Williams' concep
tion erred on the sice of prosiness,
that surprised in face of her quite
charming inferpretaiion of the noc
turne and polonaise of Chopin. But
it lacked curiously in the lyric
quality, that in Enia Brandt's ren
dering was so largely exaggerated.
Hardly fair it Is, however, to be
gin in this wise on the admir
ably eonscientic-us and truly artistic
work of this clever young woman. Like
all the Tolmie students. Miss Wiliama
possesses a clean, fluent technique, a
pure and mellow tone and a scholarly
and reverent appreciation of the musi
cal masters. Further Miss Williams i3
strongly endowed with the dramatic
sense, her interpretation of the Rubln
stAn concerto (D minor) in particular
being notable for its picturesque qual
ity. Her Bach, also, was excellent, the
themes and counter themes of the
fugue coming with delightful clarity
and balance. She showed the poetic
sense in comfortable measure in the
Chopin numbers and the Brahms rhap
sody was gt\ en with remarkable
breadth and- grasp. The Scarlatti
Capriccloâ a little heavily designedâ
completed Miss Williams* programme,
highly creditable to master and stu
dent alike.
â¢ â¢ â¢
The child's playing is comically au
thoritative. She knows exactly what
she wants and almost always gets it.
And it Is here that Enid's work is open
to criticism. Take the F minor* varia
tions of Haydn, for example. The giv
ing out of the theme, essentially simple,
you will remember, was sentimentalized
out of all proportion. Notes were
lengthened by a full half without rhyme
or reason, pauses Introduced and the
rubato reigned. It was the same thing,
though in less degree, with the Schu
mann numbers. "Des Abends" and the
F sharp major "Romanze"â that i3,
anywhere where the pathetic opportuni
ty offers. But this is so small a fact in
comparison with the heroic achieve
ments of the little girl, so easily rem
edied that I am sure it needs only a,
little firmness in her direction to be
avoided in future.
Enid's programme, completely mem
orized, included also the Saint-Saens G
minor concerto â only sixty- five pages
of it! â the "butterfly" etude of Chopin,
the Sinding "Fruhlingsrauschen." a
charming serenata by William Ma.son.
presented to the child by the composer,
a theme and variations of her own, the
Nicode 'â¢Tarantelle," and the Liz3t E
major Polonaise. And there was much
of it that you would go far to find bet
ter played.
ridiculously big grasp on her instru
ment. Two years have done wonders
for the child â "wonderful," "astonish
ing," are the words that come most
readily to the pen in describing her.
Her technique is truly astonishing. Her
octave passages, trills, scales, are play
ed with every appearance of ease and
with extraordinary fluency and bril
liancy. Xot only that but the tone
throughout is beautiful and the child's
dynamic control, except where her in
stinct would have a larger forte than
her fingers are yet capable of obtain
ing, is almost absolute. She has devel
oped temperamentally also, almost un
cannily, in fact.
WITH THE PLAYERS AND THE MUSIC FOLK
fT WOULD seem that after the
birth of the world. Nature In a
contemplative and Joyous
mood, created at the land's
end â in what we mortals were
pleased to call California, after
the fair Amazon, Callfria â a
miniature of every part of her
great composite earthâ gray moun
tains steeped in a purple haze; deserts
pale and hot and throbbing, sultrily
caressed by a passionate sun; cool,
green forests, whose heavy trees
chant matins to a turquoise sky; shim
mery rivers, running blue through
sun-browned tules; blood-splashed
marshes stretching away to a topaz
sunrise, and all sloping gently down
to the blue rim of ocean, whose white
naves lap languorously the soft white
band that lures their tenfler embrace.
And in these miniatures of all lands
and all climes have the artist folkâ
they who see the things that nature
hath wrought â caught her moods, felt
them, and put them on canvas for you
and far me. And at Mark Hopkins
Institute of Art are the stories told
of the, summer's whisperings of na
ture. And at this exhibit of sketches
are new names â men and women who
are awakening to the subtle call of
art. the vuigar interprcrer of nature â
and who are aiming to portray their
Jcxed mistress in her best moods.
True, there -are a few artists, and
clever, too. who insist upon unveiling
the negative side of nature â the re
pcllant Fide, and the side that sends
one away heavy of heart and slow of
step. Poets of the brush, is this not
a, prostitution of your divine gifts?
Depression, with its eaunt, gray
shadows, haunts the hearts of us with
out the bidding; then why seek its
gloomy companionship by abiding
with a picture of woe.
That the artist may paint a Calvary,
he must be plunged in wretched gloom
while he paints. And forever after
he paints it, the gloom o'erhangs it,
pervades it â if it be good art â and
glcom enters the spirit of the passer
by. But happily, the keynote of the
Hopkins exhibit is gladness, good
cheer, and budding life and vitality â
all symbols of California, the new
found home of art, the interpreter of
nature. â¢.*',
Among the clever sketches â which,
by the way, are pronounced by Cap
tain Robert H. Fletcher and many of
the directors of the institute as the best
ever presented before in the fall ex
hibitâare those of Matteo Sandona,
Ada Romer Shawhan, Eugen Neuhaus,
James A. Stanton, C. P. Neilson, John
M. Gamble. Will Sparks, Amy Dewing,
Willis E. Davis, G. F. P. Piazzoni, E.
J. Cross, Alice B. Chittenden, Anna
Frances Briggs, Elmer Wachtel, Alice
Richardson, Eva Withrow, Norman St.
Clair. L. P. Latimer, Mary E. Stokes.
Sydney J. Yard, J. M. Griffen, Kate C.
Thompson, J. W. Clawson, A. Altmann,
with Madame de Junosa, Madame
Areales, Lillian O'Ryan, Mrs. Frank
lin K. Lane and Miss Campbell show
ing miniatures. Besides these are some
interesting cartoons for applied art by
Mrs. Albertine Wheelan, likewise some
bookplates.
On the four gray sides of the
Mary Searles gallery are these clever
sketches Ehown. some, to be sure, bet
ter executed and more fascinating than
ethers, but all worth while. And the
dominant note in the work of the new
men and women â even as with .the
deans of San Francisco artâ is orig
inality and spontaneity.
At Claxton's there's a bust that every
lover of the beautiful should seeâ "La
Voluta," by the famous Genoese, San
sebastiano. It is in marble with the
blue veins in the showing hu
manly in the hea\ \ breast, in the
soft, round chin, anu in the half-con 1
cealed forehead, over which is drawn a
filmy veil symbolic , of the subtlety of
women, whose souls are said to lie deep
in, shadows. It Is one of the. two San-.
sebastianvj in the United States.
Cadenasso's exhibit has been a splen
did success, artistically and financially.
So, too, with . Maren Froelich'sâ and
thus do the artists wax happy.
Lillian O'Ryan's miniatures are a joy
â a joy not commensurate with their
size. Her portrait of Miss Marie Wells
is as dainty as a summer cloud reflected
in the azure bosom of a mountain lake.
True, the subject was worthy of Miss
Ryan's art, but the treatment Is soft
and tender and mellow. The same ar
tist is now busy, on a portrait of Miss
Ednah Robinson. Mrs. Franklin K.
Lane is accredited with portraits of
herself and Mr. Lane, both of which are
exceptionally clever.
On December 1, 2 and 3 the Arts and .
Crafts will exhibit it the St. Francis,
and a right clever stunt is expected of
them that compose it. It is presided
over by a charming little woman, Miss
Lillie Tobey, who does. many wonderful
things in leatherâ and they're not
shoes. It holds as members some of
the very best people in town in applied
art as well as in high art, among the
latter Maynard Dixon, Xavier Mar
tinez, C. P. Neilson, John M. Gamble
and a lot of clever chapsâ and equally
clever women.
â for these does the world owe him.
Sydney P. Yard is showing a charm
ing bit of seashore, storm-swept, with
waves washing high on the white sand,
threatening the anchorage of pink and
purple blossoms that rest like bits of
amethyst there. C. P. Neilson, to whom
the sentiment of the Spaniard and his
civilization appeals most strongly, has
some charming bits, notably his ex
quisite "Scene in. Orizaba."
Piazzoni, to whom three front names
were wholly superfluous to a chap
whose cleverness distinguishes him
from his fellows, has an alluring
sketch, "Midsummer," where a flock of
fluffy sheep, a clod of a shepherd, a
great softly swelling hill and a round,
red sun form the features. This farm
er's lad â as he was known at the art
echool some half-dozen years ago â has
in him that which makes great artists.
And It's manifest now in his new work.
Delicacy characterizes him.

MONDAY,
A busy week and a merry one. with
the following stunts on the cards:
Even as the ateliers color the social
life of Paris, so the studios of
Kan Francisco are directly influenc
ing: society in the city by the
Golden Gate. And though the influ
ence grew slowly, even as a dewdrop
percolates into the soil, the fertiliza
tion hay taken place and the blossoms
of appreciation are blooming pay in
the studios the length and breadth of
the town. And that the smartest of
the smart pet, likewise they who fain
would be of the smart set, are desir
ous of rubbing elbows -with artists, i3
shown by the attendance at every stu
dio reception given during the past
three weeks. And in truth the men
and women who visit the abiding:
places of art are really In sympathy
with it and seemingly understand
something about it, save in an occa
sional instance, where the smart set
visitor is the possessor of a Corot or
a Mcissonirr or a Millet, and then, oh
then, the local "atmosphere" vanishes.
But this Saturday afternoon studio
railing is prolific of artistic instinct.
There in the dim candle light, with
walls heavy hung with portieres and
pictures, with the teakettle singing the
j-weet song of the hearthstone â fancy
a hearthstone in a studio â where one
meets other smart people and writers
:ind singers and other artists, they
who deserted their own studios for
the hour â all this is the outgrowth of
years of sincere work by the older
men who laid the foundation of art
life away out here on the ocean's
brim. And then it's grown to be
Fm.'irt to dine in the restaurants fre
ouented by the artists, where mirth
and rare good fellowship hold high
court. At Coppa's. where Maynard
Pixcn. Xavier Martinez. Porter Gar-
Tif-tt. \V. J. McCoy and a score of
other clever chaps gather nightly,
there are to be found groups of smart
fret maids and matrons enjoying the
cartoons that pass about the board â
the song and the jest.
On Tuesday nigrht the directors of
the Sequoia Club dined^there before
the club meeting, making a merry
party. At a table near by were Mrs.
M. EL de Young and party, including
Miss Rrechemin. Miss Helen and Miss
Constance de Young.

Assistant District Attorney Ferral
Baid that it was a mere irregularity
which could not be taken advantage of
on a motion to set aside the indict
ment.
After argument Countryman asked
for a postponement till the evidence
taken at the preliminary hearing was
transcribed, aa if the court ruled
against him he desired to be in a posi
tion to prepare a b^ll of exceptions to
the Supreme Court.
The Judge refused to grant a post
ponement and Judge Cabaniss was
called and examined as to what tran
spired in his court after being served
with a certified copy of the applica
tion for the writ of habeas corpus.
Bernard Conlon, clerk of Judge Ca
baniss' court, was also examined.
Countryman then argued that all
proceedings were superseded by the
application for the writ and submitted
authorities on the point. The Judge
said he understood that, but could
such a point be taken notice of on the
ground that the defendant had been il
legally committed? Could he not have
acted by a writ of prohibition and by
not doing so did he not waive his right
to urge the point?
Attorney George Wright for the
prosecution said that Attorney Hosmer
was familiar with all the points in the
case which had already been disposed
of by Judges Cook and Sloss and he
suggested a continuance till Hosmer
returned from San Rafael. The Judge
continued further argument till to
morrow afternoon at 2 o'clock.
The case of Adolph Steffens. also
charged with fraudulently voting at
the primary election, was called for
the arraignment of the defendant. He
is still a fugitive from Justice and the
case was continued till next Saturday.
When the case of Charles Wyman,
charged with fraudulently voting at
the last primary election was called
in Judge Lawlor's court yesterday for
the defendant to plead Attorney
Countryman objected and filed a mo
tion to set aside the information. The
principal ground was that during the
preliminary examination in Judge^Ca
baniss' court the defendant was admit
ted to bail on an application for
a writ of habeas corpus before
Judge Sloss and that over the defend
ant's objection he was illegally com
pelled to be present at the preliminary
examination when further evidence
was taken pending the hearing on the
application for the writ. He desired
to show by the records what took place
at that time and to examine Judge Ca
baniss on the point. He would show
that the defendant had been illegally
committed.
Instructions have been received from
Washington by United States Attorney
L. H. Valentine for the Southern Dis
'trict of California to arrest and prose
cute S. L. Hogue, formerly a deputy
Internal revenue collector in. the Fresno
district. The charge against Hogue
will be failure to deposit public moneys
in accordance with law.
Special Revenue Agent Bert" M.
Thomas called upon Mr. Hogue a few
weeks ago and Inspected his accounts.
He found a cash shortage of $130.
"Where's the money?" inquired the
agent.
"I'll go out and get It," wu the re
ply.
"Where is it? Where do yoo. expect
to find it?" asked Mr. Thomas again.
"I'll get it from my friends.**
In a short time Mr. Hogua returned
and paid the money to the agent. He
explained that it had been his habit
during the four years in which he had
been acting deputy Internal revenue
collector to keep out sufficient money
to pay his official traveling expenses
and to refund the money when he re
ceived his allowance from the Govern
ment for those expenses. They were
usually $130 per month, which sum he
held out for thirty days at a time by
using It In the manner stated. The law
requires that deputy collectors shall
pay their traveling expenses out of
their private funds and send their bill
to the Government, and it also requires
that all moneys collected shall be turn
ed into the treasury at once.
Mr. Hogue explained that he was a
poor man and could not afford to pay
his official traveling expenses out of
his own pocket. He did not thfcik
there was anything criminal, he said,
in using the Government's money for
that purpose, but the department
thlnk3 otherwise and he will be prose
cuted.
Mr. Hogue is an old resident of
Fresno and hold the office of Justice
of the Peace for several terms. He has
been recently in the real estate and
insurance business. His character Is
above reproach.

are Inadequate.
"In our opinion it is better to hold
to what we are sure of and to that
which our people will learn to re
spect more and more each year."
The report then states that what is
required Is further appropriations,
which will allow the commissioners
to place four more game wardens in

Editor The Call: In view of your ed
itorial in to-day's issue of The Call I
believe you would be giving many of
your readers much needed information
on a current topic by publishing the
following excerpt from Dr. Schaffle's
work, "The Impossibility of Social
ism (1892):
"One cannot be too* careful to avoid
calling any and every development of
the public management of industrial
or social functions 'socialism': in other
words, confusing socialism with sys
tems of national or municipal manage
ment. The collectivism of socialism
means the centralization of all produc
tion on a common footing, with the
object of attempting to attain an equal
or at least a .proportionate share of la-'
bor and enjoyment for all: this system
to be adopted exclusively, univer
sally and simultaneously everywhere,
all trace of the wage system having
disappeared. The development of col
lective management with the obiect of
best realizing certain definite common
ends under a sufficiently stable and
authoritative guidance Is not social
ism; not even if such collective man
agement be established by states, by
parishes or by municipaltles for Iso
lated branches^of production. Such col
lective management stands directly op
posed to pure socialism." For the lat
ter means the entire abolition of money
(as we know it) and of private owner
ship in all the means of production.
Dr. Schaffie continues: "Scientific
criticism can only prove that the en
during realization of the socialistic
state of the future Is entirely out of
the question: it cannot disprove the
possibility of a successful attempt be
ing made to start an experiment In It
through some violent upheaval of the
proletariat."

SCHAFFLE ON SOCIALISM
ANSWERS TO QUERIES.
THE press reports from the Irrigation Congress at El â¢ Paso
have been meager. California is flattered by the .selection of
Governor Pardee as president of the congress, for he is a
practical man, has made a study of irrigation, and does not let
imagination take the place of facts. The location of the next ses
sion at Portland is a proper concession to the wishes of Oregon for
securing attention to the Lewis 'and Clark Exposition of next year.
Had it not been for this'the session should have been held in some
place convenient to the Federal irrigation works that are now under
way, and will begin to make a show of their capacity to effect the
object desired in the next year.
Holding the session in Portland will help spread abroad the
transactions of the congress. General information in that respect
depends more upon the reports published daily in the newspapers
where the meeting is held. The volume of proceedings of each meet
ing is not issued until some time after adjournment, when the sub
ject has grown cold and lost its value as news. The Portland press
can do the matter full justice. It is to be hoped that utility only
will control the location of the session of 1906. It should be in the
arid region, in contact with irrigation work. A majority of the
delegates have never seen such works of great magnitude, and to be
in contact with them will serve to revive the waning usefulness of
the congress.
Heretofore its consideration of the subject has been too aca
demic. It is noticed in the several admirable addresses of Governor
Pardee irrigation is not treated from an academic but a practical
point of view. The irrigation experts of the Agricultural Department
have also enlarged much practical information respecting soils, serv
ice of water and nature of crops. The Agricultural Department deals
in the practice and not the poetry of irrigation, and it is fortunate
for the arid region that it has this steadying influence, to offset the
pyrotechnic treatment of the question.
THE IRRIGATION CONGRESS.
Emperor William wrote a poem once,
which he submitted to a great literary
man who dined at the castle for that
purpose particularly. The critic read
it and found his dual duties in con
flict. He had to adviae an amateur poet
with an exceptional power of resent
ing a hostile comment. He yielded only
a very little to the exigencies of the sit
uation. "This verse, your Majesty." he
began, "seems to require alteration in
certain respects." The author took the
manuscript and conned it thoughtfully.
Then his brow cleared. "Why," he
cried, as one seeing a sudden light. "I
have actually not signed the poem.
Give me a pen." And the only fault he
saw in the work was forthwith rem
edied.
KAISER'S POEM.
The following epilogue is taken from Mrs. Gilbert's part in "Granny."
the play in which the aged actress is now appearing and which will be her
last*
DEAR friends in front â the curtain must not fall
Until a grateful woman says good-by to all-
Just think of all the kindness that I've got of you!
I'd like to be the "Granny" of the lot of you!
Old ago â¢/Â» bear becomes a happy load
When 1 â¢* and friendship line the lengthening road.
And as I've lived long years in this dear land,
I've never lacked the pressure of your hand.
Xor missed your smile the times I tried to Jest.
Nor wanted for a tear when tears were best.
So when the curtails down, the footlights out.
Once and for all for me, I'll turn about
And in my memories live again each day
Tour hands and hearts made glad for me my way.
When with Augustin Daly I acted many parts!
And Jimmy Lewis, bless him. played with me at hearts!
And Ada Rehan. the dear creature, won her brilliant spurs!
And John Drew, cheeky darling, stole my heart hers.
And charming Annie Russell, and more than I can name â
But I'll keep them in my memory, every one the same!
Dear days, so many too. red lettered ones, and gold!
The curtain falls on all of them â I'm eighty-three years old!
Good-by. old friend?, new friends, my children every one of you!
Listen, for it's true, I love each mother's son of you!
For wealth! for fame! my goodness! I don't care a filbert!
If only in your hearts you'll keep old Mrs. Gilbert.
"I am glad to hear you say this,"
replied a well-known woman, "for I
am taking the 'laugh cure.' What
does it consist of? Oh, it is simple
enough and was suggested to me by
the expression doctor. Every morn
ing when I arise I stand erect, smile
and then 'ha! ha!' out loud. It is not
so difficult as one would think. After
I have forced myself into doing this
I feel that the third or fourth 'ha! ha!'
comes very naturally, for I laugh at
myself for doing it. The result? I
am good-tempered for all day. If I
get up with a fit of the blues I feel
I have banished them simply by the
mechanical art of the 'ha! ha!' If I
am feeling good-natured I have inten
sified the emotion. The expression of
my face is changing, my temper is
getting better and my digestion is im
proved. Isn't that worth going to an
expression doctor to learn?"
The expression doctor himself con
firms all this. "There is no doubt
that the woman who cultivates her

marked one of the most successful of
these practitioners, whose office Is
thronged by wealthy women. "There
is nothing more tiresome than a
woman without a sense of humor,
who takes everything seriously, and is
so intense that she misse^ half the
pleasures of life. As a rule, Intensity
and lack of humdr are forerunners of
narrowness of life* and they make tire
some people. Of- course, there are
smiles and smiles. There is the dis

show my patrons how to laugh so that
contour is rounded out, wrinkles are
smoothed and the countenance is
transfigured.

"If you were to ask me what charm
is most potent about women I should
say the ability to laugh, and so the
expression doctor is doing good
whether he knows it or not. Of all
charms which the Creator has be
stowed upon women surely the gift
of laughter is most to be desired. Just
notice that girl over there who Is
lp.ughing. You sec she has drawn all
to her. As friend, sweetheart or wife
she is a tonic on those who love her
and her fund of amusement drives
away care and lightens the heaviest
burdens. Viewed in about every light
the woman who laughs is to be en
vied."
THE latest novelty in the fash
ionable world is a doctor of ex
pression. That is to say, the ugly
woman can be taught to smile
like a benign Mona Lisa, to quirk
her head to one side and look at you
out of large, mournful eyes like a
Beatrice Cenci, or have the upward
penitent gaze of a sorrowing Mary,
and no one save those in the secret
know that this is an acquired art, says
a writer in the Plttsburg Dispatch. On
first sight this seems folly, but if na
ture has not endowed one # with a
shapely head, a determined chin, a
soft, beautifully formed hand, why not
try to cultivate them?
"Nothing interests me so much in

The doctor exemplified this by ask
ing his class of a dozen women to
stand erect, toes out and to " v ha-ha,

instantaneous and genuine smiles soon
took the place of the artificial ones,
with which the lesson began. "Half
the troubles of the world are imaginary

he dismissed his class with a bow.

there are plenty of physiological rea

MRS. GILBERTS FAREWELL
"Kleptomania" is becoming a source
of great annoyance at the social func
tions of the women's clubs in New
York City. For the last two winters
women who frequent these gatherings
have suffered losses, and now scarcely
an entertainment of such a character
takes place that some article of value
is not missing. Jeweled hatpins, purses
and chatelaine bags have been pur
loined. At the recent breakfast of the
Women's Republican Association at
Delmonico's a sable muff was lost, ana
at the federation meeting at the Hotel
Astor an expensive feather boa was
taken. The women are thinking of
having a detective to protect them
from these annoying thefts.
HIGH UFE THIEVERY.
THE "HA-HA" CURE
This. then, is why the present war lord of the German state
hits upon Frederick the Great to typify the essence of German pa
triotism. To sit in judgment, upon the shortcomings of one whose
likeness has been presented us as a gift is at, best ungrateful and
discourteous.
*
AT last the statue of Frederick the Great, the personal gift of.
Emperor William to this country, has been unveiled in Wash
ington and now stands among the other carven notables of the
capital city. All adverse criticism and protest having been unavail
ing, the nation now stands on record as being duly appreciative of
Emperor William's evidence of good will by the sincerity of its par
ticipation in the ceremonies of acceptance through its representa
tives, President Roosevelt and his Cabinet officers.
When first Emperor William announced that he desired to pre
sent this country with a statue of the great Prussian, the cynical sug
gestion was made that we return the compliment with a likeness
of President Monroe. Others were open in protest against the in
stallation of a monarch's effigy in the capital of a republic. Still
others inveighed against our acceptance of the likeness of one who
was the embodiment of war and aggrandizement. Hardly a fit per
sonage was Frederick, said they, to associate even in stone with the
patriots of a free-born country.
All this protest is unfair in that it takes no reckoning of the
German conception of the immortal Frederick. In choosing his
great ancestor to represent the good will of Germany toward the
United States, Emperor William had in mind those qualities of the
greatest of the Hohenzollerns that give him honor in the eyes of his
people and of succeeding generations. For the Germans Frederick
stands as the great unifier, the early builder of the present German
state. He came to the throne only as a small princeling among
other small princelings: when his hand relinquished the scepter he
left Prussia in the forefront of the nations of Europe. "I am the
servant of my people."' said Frederick, and he served the people for
the best whether they would or not.
THE STATUE OF FREDERICK.
The complicated conditions of our
civilization are largely to blame for
woman's subterfuges and deceits in
love. If youths could marry their first
loves We might perhaps have a golden
age of sincerity. But boys are not able
ir. our strenuous days of competition
to earn a living. Why. their best ef
forts could not manage even to furnish
married love with pocket money.
This stern reality, however, does not
inoculate young love against the wish
f> be loved in return. And so it gt>es on
curiously, eagerly, plucking the petals
off daisies.
woman's love is in its reserve pow^r.
not in the force of its expression.
"I wanted you to know what manner
of man I was," he went on. "I had
to tell you, even at the imminent risk
of losing â oh, everything," he ended
vaguely.
"Is poverty such a disgrace?" she
asked.
"Yes," he said, slowly. "It is blight
ing, belittling, mean."
"Is poverty never anything but ig-
f "ttod Help Me, How I Love
I You!" He Cried.
WHILE the German Emperor is drawing cartoons of the yel
low peril and the Russian Czar is dreaming bad dreams on
the same subject, it is instructive to hear the other side of
the story â Japan's side. This comes to the Western world in a book
just published by Okakura Kakuzo, a cultivated thinker and student
of the problems of his native land. "The Awakening of Japan" he
calls his work and the relation between Japan and the rest of the
world occupies a large part of its discussion.
By tracing the influence wielded by the community of religious
spirit between Japan and China since the dawn of time, the author
of this book lays the premise that a war of aggression is foreign to
the very nature of the philosophic thought obtaining in both coun
tries. During its twenty-one centuries of existence China has
evolved no legendary lore of over-sea crusades, of military expedi
tions bent on heroic deeds beyond the great wall. Japan has always
lived within itself, seeking neither power nor possessions .beyond
the seas surrounding itself. The only great war in the annals of old
Japan was that waged to repel the incursions of the Tartar Genghis
Khan. It was only because by threatening the independence of
Korea, and thereby endangering the economic stability of the em
pire, China became a menace in 1894 and Russia in 1904, that new
japan took up arms for a war beyond its borders.
"Who speaks of the yellow peril?" queries the writer. "The
whole history of Japan's long and voluntary isolation from the jest
of the world makes such a cry ridiculous. However changed mod
ern conditions may be, there is no reason for supposing that either
Japan or China might suddenly develop a nomadic instinct and set
iorth on a career of overwhelming devastation."' With keen percep
tion he adds: "This cry of a yellow peril must, indeed, sound ironi
cal to the Chinese, who, through their traditional policy of non
resistance, are even now suffering in the throes of the white dis
aster."'
Indeed, it is not without profit to read what the author has to
say about this "white disaster." and thereby gather some of the de
tails of the reverse side of the picture. Europe, needing markets for
its militant commercial policy, forces its goods upon the nations 01
the East, willy-nilly, according to this authority. The individualism
of the Oriental method of production and manufacture cannot but fall
before the highly organized machine made competitive force of
Western trade. The East has become the prize to be fought over
by the maritime nations of the world, but in this struggle it is tho
East that is worsted at everv turn.
er; but, please heaven, with you I am
honest."
The girl turned her eyes and looked
at him steadily. In the moonlight her
beauty made him faint and sick at
heart with hopelessness.
"Why?" she asked again, simply.
"Becauseâ because," he stammered,
"there was something about you dif
ferent from the rest of womankind
something that touched my respect and
pride and â and â "
He looked at her and smiled. The
girl bit her lips.
Personally. I think that a man has
no right to know what a girl thinks of
him sentimentally, unless he has de
cided to ask her to marry him. The
privilege of keeping her own counsel
beior.gs to a woman as her lawful com
pensation for the lack of initiative In
love affairs which circumstances force
upon her.
Ruskin has expressed my idea very
nicely for me: "When a young man
is fully in love with a girl and feels
that he is wise in loving her, he should
at once tell her so plainly and take his
chance bravely with other suitors."
"No lover should have the insolence
to think of being accepted at once,"
he goes on to say, "nor should any girl
have the cruelty to refuse at .once,
without seven reasons." '
Nowadays only foolish women wear
their hearts upon their sleeves. In
deed, only those who are very young
either in years or in sentimental expe
rience parade the fact that they have
hearts at all. The sex has grown too
worldly wise for promiscuous confes
sions. Who taught them this wisdom?
Why. the men of course â the men,
and sorrow.
There is not the slightest reason
why a girl should -.take any man se
riously until he has proposed and
spoken to her father. The world is full
of trifiers of many kinds of plumage.
Compliments mean nothing; and per
sonal attentions are more often a mat
ter of vanity on the part of the one
who bestows them than of any especial
regard for the one to whom they are
offered.
The reputation of having survived
an unhappy love affair makes a man
appear as a hero in the eyes of his
IS there any sign or signs by which
one may know If a girl Is really in
love?
Certainly this question was put
to me by a masculine reader,
though the note which brought it gave
no reliable clew to Its writer's sex. For
the very fact that a girl does not
usually know her own mind would be
enough to convince her that she can
read the rest of womankind as easily
as she can an open book.
I embark upon my answer with a
feeling that I am venturing upon
treacherous waters. On the^ one side
is Scylla, on the other Charybdis. How
am I to be loyal to my own sex and
instructive to the other? Probably
when I am through I shall feel like

fellows. Consequently a man feels freÂ»
to show his love as he will. He has no
need to hide it. Every one is willing
to concede that it does him credit.
But with a girl the case is different.
Disappointment in love, if known, is a
blot on her 'scutcheon. It hurts her

voice hardened â "current gossip would

THE trend of the shore lay hard
and black and ragged in .the
moonlight. Long even swells lift
ed the yacht like a cork, en their
giant bosoms, poised her there for
a moment, and then went sliding
landward. Far away on a tiny dot
of an island a sleepy little lighthouse
blinked' with lazy regularityâ now
white, now red.
In the cabin the piano tinkled mer
rily, and snatches of ragtime and ex
cerpts from the latest musical farce
were greeted with much laughter and
noisy applause.
There was not even a catspaw of
wind. The yacht lay becalmed, riding
over the swells like a great white sea
bird with folded wings.
In two chairs near the wheel sat a
man and a girl. The girl was dressed
in white; her face was hard and set;
her eyes were fixed on the distant point
where the breaking waves outlined the
shore in frothing white. ' The man's
eyes were regarding the girl gravely.
His mouth was set tightlyâ so tightly
that harsh lines appeared and gave
his usual careless, jovial face a new
and far less attractive expression. But
presently the harsh lines relaxed some
what and the man smiledâ a rather ar
tificial smile and fraught with much
cynicism. He leaned toward the girl.*
"At least." he said slowly, "I have
been thoroughly honest for once."
The girl did not move and for some
time she did not speak. When she did
it was one questioning word in a col
orless voice.
"Why?"
The man laughed as if he were ill
at ease.
(Copyright. 1904, by T. C. McClure.)
Tom Van Remsen came up from the
cabin some time later. He approached
the pair by the wheel with a little de
precating cough of warning.
'â¢Come on down and Join the fun in
the cabin, you two mooners," he said.
The girl sprang up with a happy
laugh.
"Tommy, deaf," she chided. "please

noble?" she persisted.
"Never!" he replied.
lf And you say you've told me the
whole truth?" she still questioned.
He nodded. The girl rose; her eyes
flashed.
"You haven't," she said, with spirit.
"You haven't said a word about why
you are poor. You haven't mentioned
to me that it was because you shoul
dered your father's obligations, which
you might quite as well have evaded,
had you been so minded."
"The cause is immaterial; it is the
effect that counts," said he.
"You shall not say that," she said,
hotly.
For a moment he was tempted to
take her in his arms and tell her that
nothing should matter, nor height nor
depth, nor powers nor principalities.
He was a starving wanderer and here
was food. Then cool, calm judgment
returned.
'â¢Exit your pictured hero," he said,
evenly. "Slow curtain, red slide on the
calcium light, creepy music. You have
overdrawn him somewhat."
They stood facing each other. The
moonlight glinted on the polished brass
work of the rail and binnacle. The
sleepy little lighthouse blinked its red
and white with stoic regularity. The
tinkling piano wes accompanied by
voices raised in gay snatches of song.
The girl's fingers worked nervously.
The tears overflowed her. eyes and ran
unheeded down her face. The man
stared helplessly. In the cabin the
song came to an end amid much laugh

power to broaden the knowledge of
many studies was manifested. The
talk on the use of the solar lantern re

many grammar school studies. In the
work accomplished in the training de
partment the visitors recognized the
value of modern theories which have
been carefully worked out through
practice. Not least of all attention be
stowed on this actual school work was
that of manual training. This work
alike of scholars in the training de

teachers was watched with keenest in

for the early introduction of such
exercises in Amador County.
It was apparent that there were no
dissenting views among the sixty-five
vistors regarding the value of this di

them* voiced her appreciation by say
ing: "To me the greatest benefit of
this trip is its broadening and general
cultural effect" Others said: "I was
impressed with the excellence of the
methods of the primary work," "It

ourselves in the art of teaching," "It

Wanted â Honest farmers! So many
and probably the most successful of
our citizens were reared on the farm.
Many of the homely virtues of truth
fulness and fair dealing were inculcat
ed there. Tet deceptions do not all clus
ter around city halls. Not all farmers
are honest. We may well plead for
more honesty in those agriculturists
who are not over scrupulous.
Wanted â Honest merchants! A mer
chant can to the last item be honest.
There is never any need of falsehood
misrepresentation. Yet how many lies,
were told yesterday over the counters
of our commercial establishments!
While considered insignificant because
relating to insignificant sales, the man
who told them compromised himself
and picked his own pocket.
Wanted â Honest men and women not
only behind the counter, hut before th*.
counter; honest employers and -honest
employes; honest lawyers, honest doc
tors and honest preachers.
"An honest man's the noblest work
of God," sang Pope: and- Burns pufit:
"An honest man, though ne'er sae
poor, is king of men for a' that"
lived to see the folly of his epigram
and was manly enough to acknowledge
it.
receiving from parents far away who
tremble for their sons in this city, it
seems to be taken for granted it Is
simply a vortex of iniquity, sucking in
to their certain ruin the youths who
flock hither. The notion is as false as
it is baseless. Thousands of business
men in our city are prosecuting busi
ness â and successfully â with a sensitive
and Fcrupulous conscience, and there
are here as noble bands of pure and
right-minded young men as can be
found anywhere.
Honest men are in demand. A high
minded, truthful man may not meet
with success immediately, but he is on
the surest road to it. The world is
looking for honest men.
Wantedâ Honest men in politics. For
a time the people will allow themselves
to be fooled, will let the rings of every
party nominate men who belong to
them body and soul, so that when the
voter In the election booth makes ready
to exercise his great prerogative as an
American citizen he finds that he is
limited to a choice between two thieves!
But you can not fool the people all the
time â there will be a demand for hon
est men. Boss Tweed will eventually
wear the stripes. "Honest Abe" will
eventually occupy the Presidential
chair. The United States Senator who
said "that the ten commandments had
anything to' do -with American . poli
tics was only an iridescent dream"
mltted in the name of success. Men
have obtained millions .of dollars by
legal or Illegal thieving and bought
their way into society who ought to
be in the penitentiary. Better to be a
man than merely a millionaire. Get
rich-quick schemes are flooding the
land. Fortunes are offered the people
for nothing. Men prominent in church
and state are published as directors,
used as decoy ducks to draw in the
unsuspecting. The only explanation of
the prosperity of these transparent
frauds Is in Carlyle's concise census of
the population â "mostly fools." If it
were not that the desire for wealth
has become a mania, no one would ex
pect to get a dollar for 50 cents, unless
it be a counterfeit, nor believe that gold
mines go begging for stockholders. As
a matter of selfishness "honesty is the
best policy." But he who is honest for
policy's sake is already a moral bank
rupt. Men of policy are honest when
they think honesty will pay the better,'
but when policy will pay better they
give honesty the slip. Honesty and
policy have nothing in common. When
policy is in, honesty is out. It is more
honorable for some men to fail than
for others to succeed. Rather be like
Longfellow's honest blacksmith, "who
lookad the whole world in the face and
feared not any man," than enrich
yourself at the sacrifice of character
and conscience.

Such young men there are in San

From letters that I am continually
Young men have often a stiff battle
| to fight. It is not an easy matter in
these days to get just into the groove
we would like. Success In any line is
difficult of attainment Competition
is excessive and numbers find it hard
to make a living. But I am bound to
say that given probity and persever
ance, I have never yet seen a man go
to \e wall. I have met with plenty
of young men in trouble, but in most
cases there was some moral defect.
With business honeycombed with
fraudulence, with swindling elevated to
almost a science, with employers who
have one code of virtue for domestic
life and another for business, with so
many cheating all around them, it
takes courageous fidelity to principle
to maintain ri&1d integrity. It is not
soldiers that do all the lighting. A
man may stand without flinching near
the cannon's mouth, or bear without a
murmur acute pain and yet be a poor
coward in the presence of temptation.
To stand with manly firmness "four
square to all the winds that blow," to
refuse to budge one inch across the
line of principle, displays a nobler
quality than all the mere animal pluck
of the soldier, who -
Faces fearful odds
For the ashea of his fathers
The public mind is diseased on the
subject of money-making. The heroes
are fast getting to be those who have
most skill in swallowing trust funds,
in engineering grafts and shady finan
cial schemes. Our young men are daz
zled by the quick success and say,
"That's the way to do it. He was a
poor man a few years ago; now see
what a gorgeous turnout!" Hundreds
of ycung men are being indoctrinated
in the idea that money must be had
quickly, and that the larger the scale
on which they take it, the more admir
able the business acumen. It is to
be feared that the application of our
bankrupt laws often reduces stealing
to a fine art. A man may wipe out his
debts by compromising with his cred
itors and, strange to say, will be treat
ed kindly in proportion to his fall.
Smash on a small scale and the world
will Jump on, you with both feet;
smash on a grand scale and the world
will take you by the hand. He who
steals a vest from a second-hand cloth

without the opportunity of looking out
of the window, but the defaulter as
tonishes Golden Gate Park with his
equipage. Nevertheless, It is still as
true as ever that "he that hath clean
hands shall be stronger and stronger."

HONEST men are not as
scarce as Diogenes would
have us believe. "We have
little sympathy with that
ancient cynic who hunted
the streets with candles at
noonday to find an honest man. Di
ogrenes' nearest neighbor may have had
quite as much difficulty in making such
a discovery. If you think there is not
a true man living you had better, for
appearances' sake, not say so until you
are dead.
Xor have we any sympathy with the
cynic who, as history informs us, be
ing ordered to summon the good men
of the city before the Roman censor,
proceeded immediately to the grave
yard and, standing on a grave, called
to the dead below, saying he knew not
where to find a good man alive. The
saying that "one cannot be honest and
live" and that other one, "every man
has his price," are both as old as the
devil and just as little to be believed.
There are "good men and true" in
every walk of life.
But there never was a greater need
than now of the inculcation of hon
esty in the common affairs of life. Mr.
Froude, the distinguished historian,
said that he had heard hundreds of
sermons on the non-essentials, "but
never one on common honesty, or those
primitive commandments â thou shall
not lie; thou ehalt not steal."

AN important educational ex
periment has been made dur
ing the past week by the
holding of the Amador Coun
ty Institute at the State
Normal School at San Jose.
This experiment is important because
of jtf Immediate fruits; it is more im
portant by reason of its initial charac
ter in the departure from a Ions es
tabiithed custom. For moie than a
generation the Teachers' Institute sec
liun <>t the school law of California has
rigidly required the holding of an an
nual institute ia a large majority of
the counties. Almost without excep
tion this law has been interpreted to
require that at least some of the ses
: ions of these teachc-rs' meetings should
be held in their own county. This has
been deemed a hardship in many coun
ties, which are remote rrom educational
(.enters, particularly the mountain
counties. It is certain that they are
of all drawbacks to successful insti
tutes, it is next to Impossible to obtain
lecturers from the universities. These
lecturers simply cannot afford to spend
the time that is needed to reach moun
tain points.
For ten years past the repeal of the
institute law has been repeatedly dis
cussed in county Institutes and State
associations, the agitation culminating
in several instances in the passage of
resolutions favoring an early change
in the law^ But here all action ended;
no suitable substitute for the local in
stitute was in sight.
Up In the foothills of the Sierras, per
haps 100 miles from San Francisco as
the crow flies, lies the little countv of
Amador. It has less than 600 square
miles of territory and its chief Interest
is mining:. A railroad enters its west
ern line terminating at lone. The pop
ulation is not far from 12,000 and the
school children number 3500. This coun
ty has a school superintendent, George
A. Gordon, of whom it may be said In
brief that his mind for a number of
years was In the condition sometimes
termed a "state of glorious discontent."
Ht recognized the limitations of his
Such satisfaction and so many solid
benefits were realized by this traveling
institute that Superintendent Gordon
determined this year upon a more am
bitious effort. Among his â¢ sixty-six
teachers there are only eight who have
had professional training and an equal
number who have attended a" summer
normal school. Believing that the
greatest gain that could be realized by
his body of teachers would come
through a thorough personal examina
tion of normal school methods he made
arrangements with the officials for a
visit to the State Normal at San Jose.
Concessions were made by the â¢ local
teachers and longed to help them to
larger spheres of thought and practice.
After wrestling with the problem for a
time he took counsel with some of the
leading educators of the State and de
cided upon an expansive movement.
That small county should no longer be
the horizon of his teachers. In 1901 af
ter securing their co-operation and
pledge of attendance he next obtained
the written consent of all the boards of
district trustees to the holding of the
annual institute among scenes of pro
fessional interest in Alameda County.
The time was spent in visiting the lec
ture rooms and library of the State
University and in close inspection of
the schools of Berkeley and Oakland. :
Of the whole number of sixty-six
Amador County teachers, sixty-five
came, one being detained by Illness.
The teachers on. .arriving at San Jose
received a hearty and enthusiastic
welcome from President Dailey and
the faculty of the Normal School. A
programme had been specially pre
pared which gave the visitors a view
of practically all the work carried on
in the school. Lectures were given in
world geography under the super
vision of an experienced instructor
whose broad study , had been supple
mented by a. year's travel around 1 the
world. Primary reading and language
were illustrated by teaching of train
ing classes along the lines of work that
are done In Amador County. Nature
study was similarly shown with chil
dren, whose delightful freedom indi
cated how closely such a subject
touches a child's heart. Drawing; be-
stage lines and by the Mount Hamilton
Stage Line, the liberal round trip 'rate
of 54 35 from lone to San Jose was se
cured from the Southern Pacific Rail
way, with stopover privileges in Palo
Alto and San Francisco,, and special
rates obtained from hotels in San Jose
and San Francisco. Thus the endeavor
to bring the expenses of. railway fare
and hotel charges within the limits of
a week's salary of each teacher was,
successful.

should exhibit in one building, but

BENEFITED BY THE FAIR.
Charles F. Wyer of the Fresno ex
hibit has addressed a circular letter
to the various county exhibitors, ask
ing them two questions: "Do you be
lieve your section has benefited by ex
hibiting at the Louisiana Purchase
Exposition?" and "Do you think it
wise to exhibit at the Portland Fair?"
The exhibitors have been unanimous
in answering that much has been ac
complished by exhibiting here and
that it would pay every part of the
Slate to exhibit at Portland.
A general summary of the results
obtained makes it evident that Cali
fornia will gain greatly by her excel
lent exhibits here and the work of the
Slate and county commissioners. To
go into the many direct instances
where new settlers and capital have
been acquired would be impossible,
but an interest has been created that
will bring money for new enterprises
and settlers to California for a long
time. The efforts put forth at this ex
position have, in fact, been a crown
ing work, a final building of a world
reputation for the State of horticul
tural wonders that cannot be shaken
and will make all future exposition
work certain of profitable results.
A beautiful souvenir volume of
scenes in and around Los Angeles is
being presented to the exposition offi
cials and State Commissioners by the
Lcs Angeles Chamber of Commerce.
The volume Is bound in leather and is
handsomely illustrated on heavy pa
per. It was published through the ef
forts of Mrs. Frank P. Wiggins, wife of
the California commissioner, and Mrs.
Roy Jones of Santa Monica.
CAJjIFORNIANS AT THE FAIR.
Dr. John M. Williamson. Joseph Mag
rier and J. L. Vermeil, all of San Fran
cisco, the two last named being well
known hay dealers, were among the few
Californians at the fair last week. They
did the exposition together and as a
consequence the hay men learned
Fomething they had never known about
surgery, and the physician something
he had never known about hay.
Whsn Dr. A. P. O'Brien was here he
naturally took great interest in the
Board oÂ£ Health exhibit in the San
Francisco building and was amused to
find there the "roast" of Mayor
Schmitz delivered by Dr. Williamson
as president of the outgoing Health
Board. He tolrt of it as a Joke to Dr.
Williamson when he got back to San
Francisco and the latter naturally
looked for the document when he visit
ed the San Francisco building to see
how it would look in print. The "roast"
was missing. Looking over the register
Dr. Williamson found that Dr. D. F.
Ragan, present Health Officer, had
been there in the meantime. The
Health Officer will have to prove that
he didn't remove the report or buy a
dinner when Dr. Williamson gets back
to San. Francisco.
The election to Congress of J.' A.
Yerington, one of the Commissioners
to the World's Fair from Nevada, has
been a source of pleasure to the other
State Commissioners to the fair. He
was president of the Commissioners
Association and his hard work to pro
mote the Interests of that body was
greatly appreciated. When he left here
It was supposed that he was merely
going as a victim for the good of his
party. The Roosevelt sweep, however,
brought many surprises.
The fact not generally known except
in World's Fair official circles that Mr.
Yerington used his owp funds to help
maintain the Nevada building and ex
hibits raised him in the esteem of his
fellow Commissioners. Commissioner
Ed. ITardln also contributed to the
cause from his private funds. Both
served without salary.

CALL BUREAU, ST. LOUIS, Nov.
19.â Belated Californians who are see
ing the glories of the Louisiana Pur
chase Exposition approach extinction,
except as they may live in the store
house of memory, are also getting an
illustration of what California would
be like without its wonderful climate.
They are seeing trees and plants from
that favored land shuddering and
sickening as the season wanes and the
premonitory signs of winter's grasp of
ice are manifest. The tropical prowths
of the-Golden State can't do much here
outside of a hothouse.
The summers, hot as they are, will
not even mature the citrus fruits.
Pomelo, or grape fruit, trees from
Sacramento, which were set out in
front of the Palace of Agriculture, con
tain fruit about one inch in diameter,
which has not increased any in size
for a month. That seems to be the
highest possible attainment for a grape
fruit here out of doors. Those on the
trees will never show any signs of
ripening, but will soon fall off.
The orange trees .planted in front of
the California and San Francisco
buildings did about as well in propor
tion. Some of the oranges on them
grew to the size of a pigeon egg. Not
many appeared on the trees, as souve
nir hunters managed to get away with
most of the blossoms as they appeared.
The orange trees have been taken up.
The struggling pomelos and oranges
have been inspected after the fashion
of nests of young birds. Hundreds of
eyes have peeked between the leaves to
get a glimpse of the immature green
fruit. Nothing horticultural produces a
keener interest among people of *the
snow regions than an orange, even in
its infancy, and to see them actually
growing on trees, though they be but
like bullets, is a treat to many a far
mer.
The Yucca palms set out in front of the
California building look like old Iadie3
with severe attacks of toothache. They
are carefully hooded, that the frosty
nights may not ruin them before some
disposition can be made of them. Only
the hardy shrubs from Golden Gate
Park seem to be holding their own as
the winter comes on. They are bright
and fresh and seem to really enjoy the
snappy weather. The State Commis
sioners have about $3000 worth of trees
and plants on hand .that they cannot
even give away, as 50,000 specimens
are about to be dumped on the market
by exhibitors who find it unprofitable
to take them home again. The Cali
fornia Commission will send the palms
it has to Portland in case it finds the
freight bill will be less than new palms
will cost them there.
It is a result of every big exposition
that agriculturists benefit by each
other's exhibits and carry home many
new ideas that are of benefit to them
selves and their localities. In fruit
and grape growing California has had
little to learn here, while supplying
other sections with a vast amount of
knowledge on the subjects of horti
culture and viticulture, but in the pro
duction of cereals, vegetables and spe
cial crops California farmers have
picked up some valuable points. Some
of the colder regions have made elab
orate cereal displays, exhibiting new
specimens that have attracted atten
tion and advancing some new methods
that have been worth studying. Prac
tical grain raisers from the West have
found a good subject for investigation
in milling wheat.
From opinions gleaned from the
group of California cour>ty exhibitors
here it is certain that most of them
will be strongly opposed to the mak
ing of a mingrled collective exhibit at
the Portland Fair â that is, one in
which the articles exhibited from the
various counties are mingled and dis-.
liitgulshed only by labels â and the in
fluence of most of these exhibitors will
carry in their localities. It has been
stated here that the plan to be pur
sued at Portland was an intermingled
exhibit. All the county commission
ers are willing that the entire State

sglngly. slow flour trade seem to be telling
against the high price of wheat. At cur pres
ent prices we are way out of line of export
business and the trade will need a very urgent
cash demand fcr home consumption to main
tain present level of prices. Tbe selling to-day
had every appearance of liquidation sales
and established a new low level. The only
supi>ort apparent came from shorts and on a
little rally seemed to be for sale. *. The trade
will co home to-night more bearish than for
some time and the natural result of this bear
ish feeling will be. an oversold pit condition
from which a sharp rally can .be uxpected.
Untll conditions as outlined above change we
can but feel that It Is r?asonably safe to sell
wheat en sharp bulges . as the tendency to us
KÂ«Â«mc 'for lower prices. The market U local

Receipts of domestic Poultry were very light,
as usual on Saturday, and all descriptions
cleaned up quickly at steady prices. A car
of Western chickens was marketed,, leaking
the fourth for the week and sold off well at
good figures. Dressed Turkeys were In light
receipt and met with prompt sale at well
maintalned rate?. It is generally expected that
receipts of prime dreseed stock from Califor
nlan points will ' be rather light during
Thanksgiving week, but liberal receipts are
expected early In the week from Oregon. Most
dealers expect a good market and it is not
believed that prices of the best stock will go
below 25c per pound.
Game was in good request anJ. although re
ceipt* were unusually heavy, prices of all de
scriptions were, well sustained. .

One of the most important of the
recent shies in the district south of ,
Market street was closed yesterday
when the southwest corner of Fifth
and Folsom streets was sold by Mrs. ;
Helena Schlessinger, through her Â¦
agents, Davidson & Leigh, to Mrs.
Rosalie J. Colombat. The property,
which has a frontage of 90 - feet on
Fifth street, by 75 on Folsom, with
frame improvements, comprising eight
stores and eight flats, bringing $262 50
per month, was purchased by the late
A. Schlessinger in 1901 for $35,000.
This is the first sale made In this lo
cation for some time and. goes to in
dicate that the intention of investors
is attracted to. this street, where there
stems to be a better chance for profit
than on the higher priced streets, both
east and west. The new owner will
modernize the property to some ex
tent and hold it as a permanent in
vestment. ;

OUTSIDE SALES.
Attorney O'Grady wanted to put
Secretary Welch of the Grand Jury
and Foreman Lilienfeld on the stand,
but Byington objected and the Judge
sustained the objection and ordered
them to proceed with the argument on
the motion to set aside the indictment.
After a lengthy argument the Judge
said he would render his decision to
morrow morning.
The Judge said that the statement
made by defendant's counsel as a rea
son why the court should exercise dis
cretion and proceed anew and allow
oral testimony did not appeal to the
court. It would be refused.
The District Attorney then filed
counter affidavits by Alfred Llljenfeld,
foreman of the Grand Jury; six other
grand Jurors and Assistant District At
torney Weller that Rebstock was not
compelled to testify, but that when
asked if he desired to be sworn and
give testimony he replied in the
affirmative and gave his testimony
freely and voluntarily.
Rebstock's attorneys wanted to put
Foreman Lillenfeld on the stand, claim
ing they had the right to produce oral
testimony in support of their aver
ments, which was objected to by As
sistant District Attorney Ferral on the
ground that the matter was closed by
the filing of the counter affidavits.
After argument the Judge said the
defendant's attorneys had the oppor
tunity of placing the members of the
Grand Jury on the witness stand, but
had not done so. Instead they had
taken the most unusual course of filing
an affidavit under the pains and pen
alties of perjury. They could not now
claim the right to produce oral testi
mony in support of the affidavit and
must be held by the course of procedure
they had adopted.
Attorney Newburgh said he had been
misled by a decision in the New York
courts, and if defendant's counsel had
erred through ignorance of the law, the
defendant should not suffer. He
thought the affidavit was in the nature
of a pleading and after the counter
pleadings had be"en submitted an issue
was formed and oral evidence could be
presented upon that issue.
Ferral pointed out that he had ob
jected to defendant proceeding by
affidavit when the Grand Jury was
brought, into court to testify, but he
was overruled. At that time counsel
did not say that he contemplated using
one witness.
When the case was called yesterday
morning District Attorney Byington
again asked that Rebstock be placed on
the witness stand for cross-examina
tion as to the actions of the Grand Jury
in finding the' indictment, but the
Judge again refused on the ground that
the defendant must not be unduly
harassed.
Through a misunderstanding of the
law on the part of his attorneys,
Joseph Rebstock, charged with violat
ing the election law while an inspector
at the recent primary election, was de
nied the privilege by Judge Lawlor
yesterday afternoon of examining the
members of the Grand Jury on his mo
tion to set aside the indictment against
him.

fenced and offered for sale by Bald
win & Stetson by December 1.
MRS. MARTIN'S PURCHASE.
The real estate market during the
past week, while lacking in striking
features, was nevertheless lively. There
were no transfers of heavy holdings,
but enough' small parcels of land
changed hands to keep the market
moving. Some large deals will, it is
expected,' be made during the coming
week, j
In the neighborhood of the park and
along the ocean beach buying has been
particularly brisk. Boulevard lots are
In demand not merely for speculative
but also residence purposes. Sol Getz
& Son report that the block recently
put on the market by that firm, along
the ocean boulevard, is almost entirely
taken up and that parties are serious
ly considering the advisability of erect
ing apartment houses along the drive
way.
While renting is quite brisk, as is
customary at this season of the year,
there is a decline in the demand for
fiats, apartment houses apparently be
ing preferred. Good sites for apart
ment houses are in demand, but offer
ings are few. Prospective builders of
apartment houses seem to favor prop
erty in the vicinity of Van Ness avenue
and O'Farrell street.
The demand for El CerrltoPark lots
at San Mateo. still continues active.
Several sales have been made during
the lost week.

MUKDEN, Nov. 20. â The position at the front is unchanged. Positive Information received herÂ© contradicts previous reports and says that
the Japanese have decided not to begin a serious operation on Mukden before a definite result at Port Artlrarâ either a fall of the fort

then they Intend to confine themselves merely to holding; the Russians in check. Officers who have Just arrived here from the extreme
right say that the fighting which commenced there' showed that the Japanese apparently were testing both the Russian flanks in turn. Both
armies occupy very strongly fortified positions. All the ranges are carefully marked and whichever army attacks Is likely to suffer severe loasea.

message was received, stating that
four torpedo boats which had been pur
chased by Japan had left the Danish
fjords.
When the Kamchatka left Skagen
she was convoyed by two cruisers, but
lost them on the first night during a
fog. The weather cleared on the sec
ond night and shortly after 8 o'clock
four vessels were sighted, steaming
rapidly. An order was given to man
the guns and the Kamchatka fired
blank shells as a warning to the ves
sels to change their course. They con
tinued to approach, however, where
upon the Kamchatka commenced a fu
rious cannonade.
Two torpedo boats crossed the line
of fire. Under the searchlight. Kooy
says In his letter, he clearly saw two
torpedo boats, and he Is certain they
were not Russian vessels. One of the
torpedo boats launched a torpedo, but
the Kamchatka changed her position
and no damage was done. The torpedo
boat then slackened speed and Kooy
believes she was damaged by the flre
from the Kamchatka. It is stated that
the second torpedo-boat also launched
a torpedo, but he d'id not see It.

ST. PETERSBURG, Nov. 20, 1:40
a. m; â The War Office announced at
a late hour last night that it had no
further dispatches regarding the
fighting near Mukden. In the ab
sence of official dispatches press tel
egrams are regarded as evidence that
Important developments are In prog
ress and it Is not Improbable that a
general engagement Is going on.
General Sakharoff, under date of No
vember 18, reports a reconnaissance on
a large scale on November 17 In the
direction of Malkal and Chitaltse, on
the right bank of the Hun River. The
Japanese showed some resistance, but
were dislodged from these villages and
from the bridges across the Han. At
daybreak the same day the Japanese
repulsed a squadron of Cossacks thirty
miles south of Sintsintln.
General Stoessel, in a dispatch to the
Emperor dated November 2. says:
"1 am happy* to report to your Majes
ty that all the assaults from October 25
to November 2 were repulsed by our
heroic troops. The most desperate as
sault occurred, on October 30. but.
thanks to the bayonets of the reserves
and the bravery of the volunteer sharp
shooters, the enemy was repulsed at all
points. The Japanese did not return to
the attack the same day and left a
great number of dead uninterred upon
the field. .
"On October 31 the enemy twice as
saulted, but each time was repulsed at
the point of the bayonet and with
hand grenades. Several of our officers
and men were wounded.
"The spirit of the troops is excellent.
It is difficult to establish .any distinc
tion as regards bravery. All are heroes.
The bombardment of the fortress con T
tinues without Intermission."
General" Stoessel praised the work of
the Ambulance and Hospital Corps,
mentioned a number of officers for dis
tinguished bravery, and concluded:
"The Japanese losses were enormous.
I estimate them at 10,000."
SHANGHAI, Nov. 19. â The Japan

Inquiries carried on here and In South
America by Japanese agents have
elicited an emphatical denial from both
Chile and Argentine. These govern
ments are said to have stated that
they are anxious to sell certain vessels,
but not at the risk of being . heavily
mulcted for breach of neutrality.
Despite the official denials which
have been transmitted to Tokio, more
than one Japanese diplomat In Europe
Is apprehensive that in- some way or
other these half-doren war vessels may
shortly pass under the control of Rus
sia. Japanese independent Inquiries
confirm the published statement that

An agent of the Russian Admiralty
recently made an offer here to one of
the largest British shipbuilding firms
in which he guaranteed a certain
number of orders and a form of sub
sidy if the firm would ooen a navy
yard on the Baltic. The terms were
unsatisfactory and the ofTer was re
fused. A somewhat similar sugges
tion is now under consideration, by
the Vickers-Maxlm Company, but It
Is not likely to be accepted.
LONDON, Nov. 19.â The Japanese

DENVER, Nov. 19. â The specula
tion which has clouded the life of
Her. Father Michael Callanan and
which led to the plans for building a
Catholic cathedral In this city being
temporarily abandoned, promises to
turn out better than was ever dreamed
of and to pay back to the cathedral
parish all the money that was be
lieved to have been lost and much
more. In addition. Father Callanan's
private fortune will be considerably
â¢nlarped.
A rich strike In the Little Nell mine
tt Cripple Creek promises to accom
plish all this.
Two years apo Denver Catholics de
cided that they must have a new ca
thedral. A larpe eum of money -was
raised and placed in the hands of
Father Callanan, as treasurer. He
was Induced to speculate in mining
stocks, and, thinking to raise more
money for the erection of the cathedral
In this way, he secretly Invested $26,
000 of the funds In his care In stocks.
A slump In the mining- market and a
call upon the priest for funds led to his
confession. The securities were placed
in the hands of Bishop Matz and ap
praised by experts, and it was believed
at the time that they were almost
worthless.
Within the last two days strikes of
phenomenal value have been made In
the little Xell mine at Cripple Creek,
ore samples of which, running as high
as $10 to the pound, have been discov
ered. There is no doubt that the cathe
dral will recover all its money invest
ed, with handsome interest, and the
priest, who also Invested his personal
fortune, will reap a harvest.

"But, Mr. Embassador, in accepting
the statue given us to-day through you

not merely because.lt is. the statue of
a mighty and terrible soldier, but I ac
cept it as a symbol of the ties of friend

the years go on will bind ever closer
together the American and the Ger

between the two nations. We of the

Not only must the military scholar al

only will the lover of heroism read the
tales of his mighty feats as long as
mi.nkind cares for heroic deeds; but
even those who are not attracted by

his unflinching, unyielding determina

SYMBOL OF GOOD WILT/.
the Hollander settled at the mouth of
the Hudson and the Swede at the
mouth of the Delaware. Even in co
lonial days the German element had
become very strong among our people
in various parts of this country; the
Irish element was predominant in the
foothills of the Alleghanles; French
Huguenots were numerous. By the
time of the Declaration of Indepen
dence that process of fuBion which has
gone on ever since was well under way.
From the beginning of our "national his
tory men of German origin or German
parentage played a distinguished part
in the affairs both of peace and of war.
In the Revolutionary war one of the
leading generals was Muhlenberg, an
American of German descent, just as
among the soldiers from abroad who
came to aid us one of the most prom
inent was the German, Steuben. Muh
lenberg was the first Speaker of the
House of Representatives; and the bat
tle which in the Revolution saved the
valley of the Mohawk to the American
cause was fought under the lead of the
German, Herkimer. As all the different
races here tend rapidly to fuse to
gether, itÂ» Is rarely possible after one
or two generations to draw a sharp
line between the various elements; but
there Is no student of our national con
ditions who has failed to appreciate
what an invaluable element in our
composite stock the German Is. Here
on this platform, Mr. Embassador,
among those present to-day are many
men partly or wholly of German blood,
Lieutpnant General von Loewenfeldt
was then presented by the master of
ceremonies and, as the special com
missioner of the German Emperor,
The firing of the President's salute
of twenty-one guns had barely fin
ished when his carriage reached the
west stairway of the War College ter
race. V.ie entire assemblage arose as
he ascended the grand esplanade and
remained standing until the master of
ceremonies, Mtfjor General Gillespie,
had escorted him to his seat in the
front row of.the President's stand.
The Official programme began with
the invocation by the Right Rev. Dr.
Satterlee. the Bishop of Washington.
Major General Gillespie then ad
dressed the German Embassador. As
he closed his address Major. General
GHIespfs turned to the Embassndress,
and. offering her his arm. escorted her
to the edge of the statue, where were
fastened the silken cords attached to
the American and German flags, in
which it was shrouded. Gripping the
cords firmly, one in each hand, the
Enibassadress had but to give one tug
when the silken folds loosened from
around the figure of Frederick the
Great. Straightway twenty trumpet
ers of the army, drawn up in front of
the President's stand, sounded a mili
tary blare of welcome, one prolonged
note, and as the flags slowly parted,
the American to the right and the
German to the ljft. the Marine Band
struck up tho German national
anthem. Instead of. falling to the
pedestal, the flags by an ingenious de
vice, were hoisted to the top of flag
poles on either side of the statue and
unfurled to the breeze amid the in
t-piring melody of the German hymn.
The Embassadress was gowned in
gray velvet and wore a hat of chin
chilla.
SPECIAIj COMMISSIONER.
Within the gates of the Army War
College, along the line of march to
the esplanade, were stationed triops
in attendance. Formed in line to west
of the old main road through the
Washington Barracks were sill the foot
troops participating in the ceremony.
Two batteries of tield- artillery sta
tioned In the south battery of the post,
upon the arrival at the gates of the
several groups, fired the prescribed
salute.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 19.â Hailed by
a military blare of twenty trumpets,
the bronze statue of Frederick the
Great, presented to the American peo
ple by Emperor William, was unveiled
this afternoon by the Baroness* Speck
von Sternburg, the wife of the German
Embassador. â¢ The ceremony was mark
ed by great military and official dis
play. The statue was presented on be
half of the Emperor by his personal
envoy, the German Embassador, who
made- a brief- address/ The â¢ President
made the chief address of the day and
accepted the gift on behalf of the
American people. Remarks were made
by Lieutenant General Chaffee, cliief
of staff; Major General Gillespie of the
general staff, master of ceremonies;
Lieutenant General von Loewenfeld,
one of the special commissioners sent
to the unveiling by the Emperor, and
Charlemagne Tower, American Embas
sador to Germany.
Seldom has the national capital wit
nessed a more brilliant and distinguish
ed assemblage than was gathered on
the grapd esplanade of the Army War
College around the pedestal of the
statue. Immediately back of the statue
on . the President's stand, which was
completely covered with red, white and
blue bunting and decorated with
American flag?, sat the President and
his Cabinet, the German Embassador
and the Baroness Speck von Sternburg,
Lieutenant General von Loewemfeld and
Major Count von Schmettow, the Em
peror's special commissioners to, the un
veiling, and the entire diplomatic corps,
all in full uniform. On stands to the
right and left of the statue were of
ficers of the army and navy in full
dress uniform, the members of the Su
preme Court, members of Congress and
other invited guests. Directly in front
of the oedestal of the statue were
grouped members of German societies
from various parts of the country.
TROOPS IX ATTENDANCE.
"It is not my purpose here to dis
cuss at length the career of the mighty
King and mighty general whose statue
â¢we have just received. . In all history
no other great commander save only
Hannibal fought so long against such
terrible odds, and while Hannibal
finally failed, Frederick finally tri
umphed. In almost every battle! he
fought against great odds and he al
most always won the victory. When
defeated he rose to an even greater
altitude than when victorious.. The
memory of the Seven Years* War will
last aa long as their lives in mankind
the love of heroism, and its' operations
will be studied to the minutest detail
as long as the world sees a soldier
worthy of the name. It is difficult to
know whether to admire most the vic
tories of Leu then and .Prague, Ross
bach and Zorndorf, or . the heart
breaking campaign after Kunersdorf,
when the great King, after having
been beaten to the ground by the band.
"Mr. Embassador: Through you I
wish on behalf of the people of the
United States to th^nk his Majesty,
the German Emperor, and the people
of Germany for tha^gift to the nation
which you have just formally deliv
ered to me. I accept It with deep ap
preciation of the friendly regard
which it typifies for the people of this
republic, both on the part of the Em
peror and on the part of the German
people. I accept it not merely as the
Ftatut? of one of the half-dozen great
est soldiers of all time, and therefore
peculiarly appropriate for placing in
this War College, but I accept it as
the statue of a great man. whose life
was devoted to the service of a great
people and whose deeds hastened the
approach of the day when a united
Germany should spring into being.
"As a soldier Frederick the Great
ranks in that very, very small group
which includes Alexander, Caesar and
Hannibal in antiquity, and Napoleon,
and, possibly, Gustavus Adolphus, in
modern times. He belonged to the an
cient and illustrious house of Hohen
zollern, which, after playing a strong
and virile part in the middle ages, and
after producing some men like the
great Elector who were among the
most famous Princes of their time,
founded -the royal house of Prussia
two centuries ago, and at last in our
own day. established the mighty Ger
man empire as among the foremost of
world powers. We receive this gift
now at the hands of the present Em
peror, himself a man who has mark
edly added to the luster of his great
house and his great nation,' a man
who has devoted his life to the wel
fare of his people, and who, while
keeping ever ready to defend the
rights of that people, has also made
it evident in emphatic fashion thaf he
and they desire peace and friendship
with the other nations of the earth.
GREATER THAX HAXMBAL.
The last notes of "Die Wacht Am
Rhein' were drowned in the enthu
siastic greeting given the President as
ho arose and advanced to the edge of
the stand to deliver his address of ac
ceptance. The President's address fol
lows:
"In order to give this visit, which
hnd terminated under such happy aus
pices, a last memorial. Emperor Wil
liam called on the genius of Ger
many's most renowned sculpture to
create a statue of his ancestor. This
statue he has sent across the seas as
a gift of friendship to the American
people. We now behold it on the
pedestal from which it is destined to
watch the m<?n who in the magnificent
building soon to adorn these grounds
are to be instructed in those sciences
which the military genius of Prussia's
soldier King so marvelously perfected.
"May the spirit of this hero inspire
those men who are to stand as the pil
lars of the future army of the United
States with those qualities which made
the iron Hohenzollern great amone:
loaders and which alone render armies
mighty and invincible.
"Mr. President, by order of the Ger
man Emperor I hav* 1 the honor of
asking you to accept this statue as a
token of his Majesty's and the German
people's sincere friendship for the peo
ple of America." [
OVATION roil PRESIDENT.
"In many addresses with which the
Prince was honored the name of
Frederick the Great was conspicuous.
It was emphasized that the Prince's
ancestor had shown himself a stanch
and true friend of those people who
arc; now welcoming the descendant on
their own soil. It was pointed out
that Frederick the Great had proved
America's friend at a time when the
young republic was in the course of
her formation, weathering many
storms and perils. Thus it was this
dauntless Kohenzollern. the father of
Germany, who laid the cornerstone
upon which the friendship between
the two countries might securely rest.
"Emperor William followed with
keen interest the movement of his
brother in America and was pro
foundly touchetl by the attitude of un
disguised friendship and good will
which characterized every step of the
Prince, who returned to Germany as
the true interpreter of the true Amer
ican spirit.

"Mr. President: The hearty and
i truly sincere welcome which Prince
Henry of Prussia met with through
out the United States durins his visit
in February, 1902, has left a deep and
! Lifting impression on the German Em

transferred the statue to the custody
of his Majesty's personal envoy, Baron
Sternburg,' the German Embassador.
The lieutenant .general briefly ad
dressed the Embassador, saying:
"The Emperor is confident that, God
being willing', this monument will re

tinuance of the friendly relations be

THE VALUE OF CUAKCOAI;.
Few People Know How Useful It Is In
Preservine Health and Rcauty.
Nearly everybody knows that char-
coal is the safest and most efficient
disinfectant and purifier in nature, but
lew realize Its value when taken Into
the human system for the same cleans-
ing purpose.
Charcoal is a remedy that the more
you take of It the better; It is not a
drug at all, but simply absorbs the
gases and impurities always present in
the stomach and intestines and carries
them out of the system.
Charcoal sweetens the breath after
smokinb-, drinking or after eating
onions and other odorous vegetables.
Charcoal effectually clears and Im-
proves the complexion, it whitens the
teeth and further acts as a natural and
eminently safe cathartic.
It absorbs the injurious gases which
collect in the stomach and bowels;, it
disinfects ihe mouth and throat from
the poison of catarrh.
All druggists sell charcoal in one
form or another, but probably the best
charcoal and the most for; the money
ts. in Stuart's Charcoal Lozenges; they
are composed of the finest powdered
willow icharcoal and' other harmless
antiseptics in tablet form or rather In
the form of large, pleasant tasting
lozenges, the charcoal being mixed
with honey. Â¦ Â¦ â¢ -
The daily use of these lozenges will
soon tell in a much improved condi-
tion of the general health, better com-
plexion, sweeter breath and purer
blood, and the beauty of it is that no
possible harm can result from their
continued use, but on the contrary,
great > benefit. . . v
A Buffalo physir'-n. In speaking of
the benefits of charcoal, says: : "I ad-
vise Stuart's Charcoal Lozenges to all
patients suffering from gas In stomach
and bowels, and to clear the com-
plexion and purify the breath, mouth
and throat; I also believe the liver is-
greatly benefited by the daily use of
them; they cost but twenty-five cents
a box at drug stores, and, although
In some sense a natent preparation, yet
I believe I get more and better char-
coal in Stuart's Charcoal Lozenges
than In an- of the ordinary charcoal
tablets." .

T1TL.E TO EMBEZZLED
FUNDS MUST BE SETTLED
Probably the thing that hurt Mrs.
Brown-Potter most in connection with
the failure of her first production at the
Bavoy Theater was the general opinion
on the part of critics that Tier own act-
Ing left much to be desired. And to
Mrs. Potter no doubt the pleasantest
part of the success which she has Just
scored at the same theater Is Whe com
plete reversal of that judgment. Evi
dently the quality of the .material with
which she has to work makes a lot of
difference to Mrs. Potter, for she cer
tainly got the most out of both "For-'
get-Me-Not" and the acting version of
"Cavalleria Rusticana," at the Savoy.
Londoners are looking forward to her
coming .production^ of "Church and
Stage," the play which was written for
he recently by the versatile Vicar ; of
Gorleston.
r.gain to enjoy my youth, but that is
the only reason.
'Tor my first opera, 'Le Villl,' which
v.'as produced at Milan in 1884, I re
ceived 2000 francs. During the four
month?. I spent in writing it I had lived
on credit at a little restaurant called
the Aida. in a slum in Milan. My din
ner usually consisted of a cup of wine
and a piece of badly cooked meat, and
I recall to this day the stealthy manner
In which I used to tell the waiter to
write up the bill, and then I quitted the
place with wicked looks from him be
causa I had no money to lip him. When
I had these 2000 francs I went to the
restaurant and paid the bill, which
amounted^o 200 francs. The proprietor
having heard of the production of the
work, exclaimed that there was no
necePFity to settle the account. 'Let it
run on,' he said. 'No,' I replied, 'I will
pay it now and will never come back
to you because you have made me feel
my position so acutely. You treated
me shabbily.' I suppose the man be
gan to distrust me, but I felt confident
I should succeed, and aa I have told
you I was proud of my name, and
would not have cheated him of his
due." â¢ 'Â¦:Â¦:? V

After congratulating the German

The Emperor's gift is a, replica In
bronze of the statue which stands in
his palace at Potsdam, the original be

size, standing more than seven feet.
It is mounted on a pedestal of mas-
Bive granite. Frederick is standing
erect, his right hand resting on his
military staff, and he looks sharply
ahead. The sculptor has vividly por
trayed the powerful vigor which was
so striking a characteristic of the Ger
man chieftain.

"We lived In an apartment in Milan,
the landlord of which was an individ
ual whose business it was to deliver
registered letters. I don't think you
have such a person in England. On.,
this pittance we had to keep body and
soul alive, in addition to having to
work hard in order to keep pace with
our studies for the Conservatoire. We
ran into debt right and left, and before
the end of the month we often had to
pawn our sticks, umbrellas and over
coats to obtain a little money for im
mediate requirements.
"We were also a little handicapped in
having .to pay our landlord promptly.
When he in his official capacity as a
servant of the state brought us the
registered letter containing the grant
he would wait while we opened it and
he would then ask us to pay our lodg
ing bill at once. This really meant that
we had very little, and sometimes
nothing, left to remind us of the Gov
ernment's generosity except the enve
lope.
"This man was a terror. He prohibit
ed cooking In the room, because, I sup
pose, he wanted to make more profit
out of us. But when we had money
enough to purchase some eggs my
brother would play the pianoforte so
that the old man would not hear me
poactiing them. Then I started teach
ing â or rather wanted to start, for I
only secured one pupil, who paid me a
franc for each lesson, and he could only
spare time to have two a week. Later
I became a pianist at cafe concerts,
and If I had any spare time I accepted
engagements to play at dances, for
which I received seven francs a night.
I tried my hand at copying manu
scripts, having heard that Wagner had
been paid 2d a folio for this work, but
my writing was not good enoughâ and
so I drifted on.
"Would I like to go back to those
old days? Well, I should in order once
"My brother and I began studying
music together," said Puccini, "and so
poor were we that through a friend's
influence we succeded for a year in ob

a month. On this amount we had to
subsist. ' i.
Puccini, the Italian composer, whose
operas, "La Boheme" and "Manon Les
caut," are being sung at Covent Ciar
den, came to London for the first time
the other day In order to rehearse
them. This musician's great reputation
came to him only after the hardest
kind of work, and the story of his early
struggles, confided to an interviewer
the other day, is a striking one.
STRUGGLE FOK FAME.
LONDON, Nov. 19.â Alice Neilsen's
success In grand opera over here has
been a pleasant surprise to her friends.
These shook their heads doubtfully
when the American girl, who was so
great a favorite in comic opera, an
nounced her intention of deserting it
and "aiming at the highest." But t^ere
is no doubt now that the former "For
tune Teller" knew what she was about.
Her debut in London last year in "Don
Giovanni" was so successful that the
Covent Garden management risked lit
tle in selecting her to sing "Carmen"
to the I^on Jose of Caruso, but her in
terpretation of the role at the Royal
Opera-house must have surpassed their
anticipations. Miss Neilsen's singing
of the* principal role in "La Boheme"
established her position still Â¦ further.
Moreover, her appearances at Covent
Garden are being made in connection
with the engagement of the famous
San Carlo orchestra and ,chorus of
Naples, whose reputation as one of the
finest â if not the finest â organizations
of the kind in the world has been fully
sustained by the performances they
have given so far. Besides "Carmen,"
"Alda," Rigoletto" and Puccini's "La
Tosca" and "Manon Lescaut" have al
ready been sung, and among the op
eras el ill to be given are Giordano's
"Andrea Chenler" and "Francesca Cll
ea's "Audrienne Lecouvreur," both of
which are new to this country.
Another American singer who has
won increased renown on this side of
the water Is about to return to her own
country and there make an extended
tour. This is Mine. Ella Russell, who
sang with the Moody-Manners opera
company at Covent Garden last
springâ at the time of Manners'
bold attempt to make unfash
ionable grand opera pay in Lon
donâand who has been sing
ing with this troupe in the provinces
of late. Mme. Russell tells me that she
is now planning to sail for the United
States from Genoa some time in No
vember. Soon after arriving she will
start on a concert tour, which is to
open in New York and take in nearly
all the large American cities. Before
starting for home, however, the singer
will go to Russia, having arranged to
give concerts in St. Petersburg and
Moscow. She expects to be in the
Czar's domain about a fortnight, after
v^hich she will go direct to Italy. By
the way, Mme. Russell made ? an
especially interesting appearance at
Ryde quite recently, when she sang a
song composed by I'rinces3 Beatrice,
the youngest hister of King Edward.

DESCRIPTION OF GIFT.
Led by the President the assemblage
arose and with uncovered heads re
mained standing throughout the play
ing of "America" by the Marine band.
The next address on the programme
was by special request of the President,
who desJrod that Lieutenant General
Chaffee, chief of staff, should speak at
the unveiling. General Chaffee said:
"Two years from now the building
which you note as under construction
here, and which has already been dedi
cated to the acquirement of knowledge,
in military science and "in the art of"
war, will be occupied by the Third Di
vision of the general staff of the army.
Here and then will be assembled nu
merous oflleers of the army for a
course of study of the highest order
pertaining to the profession. *
"As ,these officers ascend the steps
that lead to.,tho entrance, of the War
College they will take notice, of the
ttjrure unveiled to-day, and It will re
mind them of an extraordinary genius
In their own chosen profession. The
science of war, as developed by him,
will be studied and discussed, and his
wonderful success In military. art will
furnish an incentive to effort on their
part."
In conclusion General .Chaffee spoke
at some length of. the deeds of Wash
ington and Grant on thefield of battle.
Their sta'tues, too, he said, should be
reared on the esplanade of the army

animosities among the various stocks.
In both efforts we have met with an
astonishing measure of success. v'As
the years go by it becomes not harder
but easier to live In peace and good
will among ourselves; and I firmly be
lieve that it will also become not hard
er but easier to dwell in peace and
friendship with the other nations of the
earth. A, young . people, a people of
composite stock, we have kinship with
many different nations, . but we are
identical with none of them, and are
developing a separate national stock
as we have already developed a sepa
rate national life. - We have in our
veins the blood of the. Englishman, the
Welshman and the Irishman, the Ger
man and the Frenchman, the Scotch
man, the Dutchman, the Scandinavian,
the Italian, the Magyar, the Finn, the
Slav, so that to each of the great pow
erp of the Old World we can claim a
more or less distant kinehip by blood;
and to each strain of blood we owe
some peculiar quality In our national
life or national character. 'As such is
the case it is natural that we should
have a peculiar .feeling of nearness to
each of many peoples across the wa
ter. We most earnestly wish not only
to keep unbroken out friendship for
each, but so as we can without giving
offense by an appearance of meddling,
to seek to bring about a better under
standing and a broader spirit of fair
dealing and toleration among all na
tions. It has been my gceat pleasure,
Mr. Embassador, in pursuance of this
object, recently to take with you the
first steps in the negotiation of a treaty
of friendly arbitration between Ger
many and the United States.
"In closing, let me thank you, and
through you the German Emperor and
the German people, for this statue,
which ( I accept in "the J name' of the
American people; a people claiming
blood kinship with your own; a people
owing much to Germany; a people
which, though with a national history
far shorter than that of your people,
nevertheless, like your people, is proud
of the great deeds of its past, and is
confident In the majesty of its future.
I most earnestly pray that in the com
ing years these two great nations shall
move on toward their several destinies
knit together by ties of the heartiest
friendship 1 and irood will.

NEW YORK. Nov. 12.â The result of
the Presidential election' was received by
tho*Â« on board the Atlantic steamers by
Marconi -wireless in midoceaxi. Arch-
bishop Chp.pelle. of New Orleans, who
was a pasttnger oa the "La lx>rrainÂ«,"
tent a Marconi^rram congratulating the
President on his election.
The Marconi wireless telegraph 6tation
at Cape Race was completed yesterday.
The Allan Line steamer â¢â¢Tunisian" was
the nrst ship to si>eak with it. The ves-
sel remained in communication with the
station nineteen hours and obtained the
result of the Presidential election and
other happenings.

WASHINGTON. Nov. 13.â Gen. A. W.
Gre*ly, chief jfignal officer ot the United
Btates Army, in his annual rej>ort say*
*"the new Alaskan wireless station
baa daily and uninterruptedly transmit-
ted the entire telegraph business of the
peninsula. 5000 words being exchanged in
one afternoon. The report says it is a
znatter of the utmost importance that
wireless apparatus be installed at the
more important military defenses of the
Atlantic and I'aclflc coasts to permit of
intercommunication between tne army
and the navy." Engineers of the Marconi
Company have muiie a careful survey of
the Pacnic Coast, and have found its pos-
sibilities so promising, not only for com-
XBunication from shiy to shore, but be-
tween the coast and the Hawaiian and
Philippine islands and between polnta on
the mainland, north and south, where
physical difficulties prevent the use of
land line* or of cables, that Installations
at various points will follow at the ear-
liest possible moment.
WASHINGTON. Oct. 26.â The British
Admiralty can now communicate at a
moment's notice with any of its warships
In the Mediterranean. Naturally there is
great excitement over the action of the
Russian fleet firing on the Hull fishermen. !
If it should become necessary for any \
reason for the British Government to j
send order? to Gibraltar or to the British .
fle*t at Venice, they would go by wire- j
leps. because that method is so much Â¦
faster toid ?urer than any other. Eighty
of the British warships are already j
equipped with Marconi long distance
wireless apparatus. Gibraltar has been
tar many months in uninterrupted com-
munication with England, despite the
fact that besides crossing the English
Channel the miffagis traverse lOuO miles
of Spanish territory.
The forcjjoir.g telegrams have recently
appeared in the newspapers of the coun-
try. While the Western Union and Pos-
tal Telegraph ilnes were down last week,
pa a result of h. 5everÂ« storm in the East-
ern States and all business was paralyzed,
â¢wirc]eÂ«s cie.'sasef were traveling bad:
end forth unhampered through the air
between land statior.3 and to and from
steamers at tea. What a genuine triumph
for the wireless, which needs no poles or
ivlres that can break down.
hli~. -MÂ«rconi has announced that he will
return to the United Suites in I>ecem- |
ber to open oa January 1st to the public i
for commercial business the new trans-
Â¦frantic station of Cane Breton, which :
T.iH communicate with the Poldhu trans- I
Atlantic station in England, a distance
of S&jj miles. This great, event in the
Â¦world's hisrory will be followed by the |

The Marconi system has numerous sta-
tlons in operation in the United States,
Alaska. Canada, England. Germany,
Italy. Belgium, Holland, France. Spain,
India, Japan, China, Russia, Chile, Af-
rica, South America. Congo and a groat
many other places. The il.-irconi system j
Is used every day on all i.hÂ«,* steamers of â¢
the American line, the Allan line, the
French line, the I>!g'.an line,' the Atlan-
tic Tram-port line, the Beaver line, the.
Cunard line, the Red Star Hn*\ the Ham-
burg-American line, ihe Holland-Ameri-
can line, the Italian line and many others.
It has been officially adopted and subsi-
dized with hundreds of thourands of dol-
lars, and is prominently in use on all the
principal men-of-war of the ieading gov-
ernments of the wcir'.d. By the Marconi
system wireless tolcgrams are flashed
through the air to and from steamers
thousands of mi!es away. Incredible as
this may seen, nevertheless it Is a FACT.
Eiectrical inventions offer the greatest
opportunities of our age to those who
have the foresight and the courage to in-
vest iheir savings in these latest time,
money and labor saving inventions.
L*rge fortunes have been made by thoise
who invented in Edison Electric Light
find in Bell Telephone. The shares of the
Edison company increased from 5100 to
*4<XÂ«j in one year. The profits of an orig-
inal investment of $100 in Dell Telephone
ere to-day more than C3S.0W. Marccnl se-
curities taken NOW, offer as great an
opportunity.
The cost of installation, of maintenance
and of ooeration of the Marconi system
Js bo pniall compared with that of the
cable and wire systems^that it can afford
to transmit messages for LESS THAN
HALF the price of the old systems.
Therefcre it stands to reason that the
public alleys gives the preference to the
cb'-r<pÂ«?i rate.

Hitherto the crease has been confined
to trousers, but on the j authority of
the Tailor and Cutter, it is now spread
ing to overcoats, where it is supersed

LONDON, Nov. 19.â A machine has
been Invented to crease trousers "while
you wait." It looks like a large pair
of scissors, with two small rollers at
one end. The latter are heated in a
spirit lamp and then the center of the
trousers leg, where the. crease should
be, is placed between ,the rollers and
the machine run down toward the foot.
The advantage of this contrivance 13
that it can be used while crease-re
quiring garments are being worn. The
disadvantage is that In the hands of
the inexpert It may burn holes in the
trousers and raise blisters under them.
But so consuming Is the present craze
for creases that this wouldn't be deem
ed too great a sacrifice, if ultimate
success were assured.- * â¢

To him is due that great revolution
in the training of the personnel of the
fleet which went into effect two years
ago, which is to give to th# navy in
the future admirals who are engineers
as well as sea commanders and sea
men who will be mechanics as well
as sailors. It shows his keenness to
adapt means to ends â to meet
changed conditions with changed
methods. Machinery has superseded
sails on warships and the sailor of the
future, he argues, should be as ca
pable of -handling machinery as his
predecessor of the old days was in
These are the ideas to which, as

He has been at sea for fifty years,
but he has keDt himself free of the
barnacles that are apt to cling to salts
of the old school. None realize better
than he the changes which Ji&ve taken
place which render so many of the old
traditions or the service obsolete and
that new conditions must be met by
new methods. "Our great aim in the
British navy," he said recently, 'must
be to reduce our crews by introducing
labor-saving â¢ appliances. In our fu
ture sea fights with destroyers haunt
ing v us bv night and submarines dog
ging us by day, the chief requisites
will be endurance and nerves. A ma
chine- has no nerves and never gets
tired. In the Nelsxmic days they could
go to sleep at nights. When the de
stroyer arrived we settled to po to
sleep by day. Now the submarine ha3
come, you can sleep neither by day nor
night!"
Sir John Fisher is a great admirer
and profound student of Captain Ma
han'p works on sea power. Indeed he
once said that If he could choose a
motto for his countrymen that should
serve to keep them alive to the su
preme importance of a powerful and
efficient navy, he would select there
words from one of the American
writer's books; In which he tells how
Nelson thwarted Napoleon's ambition.
"Nelson's far-distant, storm-beaten
ships, upon which the Grand Army
never looked, stood between.it and the
dominion of the world."
Vlf we -have -a supreme fleet," he
said in explaining the present day ap
plication of this utterance, "supreme
beyond argument â no "twaddle about
the . two-power standard or the three
power 'pause'â supreme as with Nel
son in the confidence of victory begot

remembrances, that supremacy doesn't

only, no hand can touch us, no combi

of our shores is possible, and no tfnxer
can ' be lifted if we say 'No!' The
frontiers of England are the coasts of
the enemy, and we have got to be thsre
exactly five minutes before â¢ war Is de
clared."
On this text he expatiated so force
fully and convincingly that he carried
his points much to the amazement of
his shore friends who had imagined
that the sailor-bred "Jackey" would
prove no match for old parliamenta

CONVINCING ARGUMENT.
Great hopes are entertained of what
Sir John Fisher will .accomplish at
Whitehall â that museum of hearty of
ficial traditions, circumlocution and
red tape. A cheerful feeling pervades
the country that he is the right man
in. the right place there â -the man who
knows what ought to be done . and
knows, too, how to get it done. As
hip portrait here reproduced shows, he
has a strong face. It bestrays pug
na^iousriess in much the same way as
does the physiognomy of our , own
"Fighting" Bob Evans. The nose i3
short, Hhe eyes large, round and far
seeing; the "mouth . full-lipped and
strong and the chin" masterful. : The
face is dominated" 1 by a broad, high
forehead, crowned' by thick, stubby
hair. It is the head of a man who is
a -deep thinker as well as a hard
fighterâa master of craft and stra
tegy no less than of bulldog pugnacity
and daring. , In fact, with all his
breeziness of manner and sailor-like
brusqueness of speech there is a deal
of Oriental subtlety in his mental
make-up. East and West are blended
in him, for his mother was a Singhal
ese woman and he was born in Ceylon.
So he knows other ways of getting
around men than by riding rough
shod over their opinions.

when as a boy of 13 he stepped on
board the old Victory at Portsmouth
he touched his cap to Admiral Sir Wil
liam Parker, whose chief claim to
fame 'lies in the fact that he was the
last qf the men who commanded a

ADVERT1SKMENTS.
PUTTING IT STRONG.
But Doesn't It Jx>ok Reasonable?
This may .read as though we were
putting it a little strong, because it is
generally thought by the majority of
people that Dyspepsia in its chronic
form is incurable or practically so.
But we have long since shown that
Dyspepsia is curable, nor is it such a
dillicuit matter as "at. first appears. -
The trouble with Dyspeptics is that
they are continually dieting, starving
themselves, or. going to "opposite ex-
treme, or else deluging the already
overburdened stomach with "bitters,"
"after-dinner pills,"' etc., which inva-
ridbly increase the difficulty even if
in some cases they do give a slight,
temporary relief. Such treatment of
the stomach simply . makes matters
worse. What the, stomach wants 'is
a rest. Now. Jiow- can the stomach
become rested,' recuperated, r.nd at the
same time- the, body nourished and
sustained?
Thi3 is the great secret and this is.
also .the secret of the uniform success
of ' Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets. This
is a" comparatively new "remedy, '.but
its success and popularity leave no
doubt as to its merit. . . V
The Tablets will' digest the food
any way, regardless/ of condition of

The sufferer from Dyspepsia, Â¦ -f ac-

abundance of good, wholesome food
and use the tablets ;. before- and after
each meal, and the result will be that
the food will be digested,, no, matter
how bad your Dyspepsia may be/ be-

will digest the food even If the stom-
ach Is wholly inactive. *'To illustrate

Church pave an entertainment at
Btelnway Hall last nitrht to raise funds
for the church. Th* 4 excellent bill drew
a large crowd to the hall and no one
was disappointed. The following com-
mittees worked hard to make the affair
a eucccss:
Reception committee â Hon. E. E.
Fehmitz, T. Boyle. J. J. Dolan, Herbert
Schmitz. W. Haley, Paul Kingston. G.
Hermann. J. Shipp, W. Byrnes. J. Duf
fy. T. M. McCarty. G. Phillips. J. De
necn, E. Duffleld.
Committee of arrangements â T. Boyle.
J. J. Dolan. Herbert Schmitz. W.
Hyrnes, T. M. McCarty, T. Crowley. J.
Duffy, J. Power. D. Brosman, C. Dono
van, Frank Larkey.
Following is the programme that
pleased:
Opening address. Mayor Schmitz;
piano solo. Novelette in E minor
(Schumann). Miss Grace Haley; bari
tone solo, selected, Charley Hay: violin
selection, "Adagio Rellgioso," Fourth
The average man thinks he isn't even
with the world, until he owes others
more than they owe him.
The grand march at 10 o'clock svas
formed by 500 costumed people and
under the able direction of Floor Man
ager John S. Parry maneuvers were
executed that evoked applause from
the assembled audience. Men of
prominence in municipal life were
present and made merry with the rest!
By midnight the large pavilion was
packed to the doors and standing
room was at a premium.
San Francisco Aerie No. 5, Fra
ternal Order of Eagles, pave an elab
orate grand prize carnival ball last
night at the Mechanics' Pavilion. The
affair was largely attended and the
enjoyment of the thing was kept up
till a late hour. The hall was well
decorated and for hours couples in
varied costume swung the dizzy waltz
or tripped the light two-step. '
Katies Make Merry at Ball.
Ills Accuser.
James C. Nealon, member of the 1
Grand Jury, being outpointed in his
effort to establish his charge that As
sessor Dodge favored James D. Phelan
in the matter of assessments, branchsd
out last night at a meeting of the in
quisitorial body and declared that
Dodge's favorites 'were legion. After
Assessor Dodge* had been answering
Nealon's questions for several hours
the Grand Jury decided to submit the
question for a decision to a sub-com
mittee. As the members were leaving
the hall one of them said: "Xealon's
effprt to impeach Dr. Dodge has re
sulted in failure. Everything was ex
plained in businesslike manner to the
satisfaction of all, except, perhaps,
Nealon."
When the meeting opened last even-
Ing Dr. Dodge was called upon to ex
plain why reductions in assessments
and raises therein were not uniform in
the same districts. He explained that
he had proceeded on an equitable re
adjustment of the entire city and
where he found that in one instance
the Board of Supervisors had previous
ly made a reduction and not in anoth
er he would proceed to balance the as
sessments, always taking into-consid
eration matters of improvements and
deterioration from age.
In one Instance it was shown that a
raise, as Nealon said, of 700 per cent
had been made on a piece of property.
Dr. Dodge admitted yiat in this in
stance the raise had been extraordi
nary, but had only been made after
investigation fully warranted the step.
Dj. Dodge was also called upon to
explain the assessment of building and
loan associations, he being the presi
dent of one, but when he showed that
the one of which he is president Is pay
ing taxes on mortgages for $2,500,000
and on all moneys on hand at the time
assessments were made, his explana
tion was taken as satisfactory, and
this line of questioning was dropped.
The Grand Jury then adjourned.
The Transvaal Messenger laments a
state of things that is not peculiar to
South Africa. It says that Midas rules
In that colony and that those who run
their heads against that fact"may exÂ«
pect them to be broken.

INVESTIGATION* OF DODGE
Concerto (Vieuxtemps), Miss Elizabeth

Song," "Violets," "I Love You, Dear,"
Alphonse Hlrsch: comic specialties,

The court then adjourned until Mon
day afternoon at 2 o'clock and Weber
was taken back to his cell.
District Attorney Robinson expected
to prove by Dipendener that Weber
had told him that there was no one in
the house. Testimony of that character
would greatly strengthen the case for
the pro&ecution. The witness would
not make the admission, however, and
to all questions along that line an
swered that he did not know who re
plied to his query. He moreover denied
having told any one that Weber had
answered that there was no one in the
house. Neither would Dipendener ad
mit the fact that the prisoner's life
might hang on his answer had any in
fluence on his testimony. All that could
be learned from him was that some one
had answered in the negative, and he
would not swear that the person was
Weber.
"I do not know that he answered
me," said Dipendener, "but some one
answered 'No'."
"What did the defendant reply?"
'Weber sat as immovable as a piece
of marble while Mrs. Snowden was civ
ing her testimony and to all aDpear
ances was not interested in the t)ro
ceediijgs. He gazed straight ahead of
him and not for an instant did his eves
turn toward the witness. Mrs. Snow
den was greatly affected, and it was
with much difficulty that she restrained
the tears while telling the story of her
nephew's heartless conduct toward her.
The clothing worn by Weber on the
night of the murders and the panta
loons purchased by him a short time
befoFe his home was discovered to be
on flre were identified by Deputy
Sheriff May and introduced in evidence.
May testified that on the knee of one
of the undergarments he found a stain
that appeared to have been caused bv
blood.
Benjamin Dipendener. who was one
of the first of the neighbors to reach
the burning Weber home on the night
of the murder, testified that he saw
Weber at the south end of the house.
"Did you ask him if there was any
one in the house?" queried the District
Attorney.
"I did," replied the witness.
AUBURN, Nov. 19.â The preliminary
examination of'Adolph Weber, who is
accused of the murder of his parents,
brother and sister, -was resumed to-day
before Justice Smith. As on the pre
vious day, there were frequent tilts be
tween District Attorney Kelly Robinson
and Attorney Ben P. Tabor, who repre
"Â¦ sents the prisoner. Robinson finally
: lost control of his temper and an
' nounced that unless the court protect
ed him from the insults of Attorney
; Tabor an unpleasant scene would like
; ly follow.
i Tabor was about to reply when Jus
Â¦ tice Smith checked him and asked Rob
' inson if he did not fear being punished
for contempt.
Robinson njade haste to reply that he
! had no desire to be in contempt of
court, but at the same time he would
Â¦ be obliged to protect himself if the
; nagging on the part of opposing coun
1 sel did not cease.
Justice Smith then cautioned the at
torneys on both sides to display less
; feeling in the conduct of the case and
! the incident closed after Robinson had
I apologized for his language.
The testimony adduced was In ef
i feet the same as that given at the Cor
: oner's inquest. Mrs. Bertha Snowden.
! a sister of the murdered woman, was
the principal witness examined durine
I the day. She repeated the story of the
â¢ threats made against her by the pris
i oner the morning of the murders, when
; he accused her of being responsible for
the circulation of a rumor that he was
I the assassin. She testified that he shook
his fist in her face and ansrrilv ex
1 claimed, "Your turn is coming next."
He repeated his threat while he was
eating his breakfast in her home, and
for a time she feared he was about to
: attack her.
Epeclal Dispatch to The Call.
After the flames were under control '
and had been sufficiently extinguished j
to permit the firemen entering the Â¦
building, the south wall fell without
warning and buried Lloyd Randolph, \
driver of city engine No. 28, and Frank j
O'Connor of city truck No. 9. Several i
streams of water were instantly direct- I
ed upon the debris covering the men i
and they were rescued before the fire j
spread to where they were entombed, j
The men were badly bruised and it is '
believed Randolph is fatally injured.
While responding to the alarm Cap
tain Edward O'Neill of World's Fair Â¦
truck No. 4 was seriously hurt. George j
Carenbach was killed and Jerry Fagin j
of the same company was probably ;
fatally injured. It was necessary for i
the truck to pass through the mining
gulch, and owing to the darkness the I
horses left the road. They separated
when approaching a large tree, the j
pole striking the obstruction with ter
rifle force, upsetting the truck and
hurling the crew in every direction.
Mrs. Belle Hall Small of Sedalia.
Mo., one of the State hostesses, rushed
Into her apartments in the building
to secure some valuables. A fireman
followed her into the smoke and found
her lying on the floor overcome. Plac
ing a wet handkerchief over her face,
he carried her into the open air,
where she revived.
"The building as it stood, with all
furnishings, cost in the neighborhood
of $225,000. There was not a dollar of
insurance. If we had endeavored to
sell the building we could not prob
ably have realized more than $5000."
ST. LOUIS, Nov. 19.â The Missouri
State iruilding was destroyed by fire
to-night, resulting from the explosion
of a hotwater heater in the basement.
Instantly the flames. shot up through
the rotunda and the north wing and
cupola were ablazetwlthin ten minutes
after the explosion.
The loss cannot be estimated ac
curately. The principal loss is in the
contents of the building. The building j
cost $145,000, and contained $75,000
worth of furnishings, the most valuable
of which were portraits of former Mis- ;
souri Governors and Supreme Judges, i
These cannot be replaced.
The flre was the most spectacular
that has occurred in St. Louis in years.
Thousands of persons hurried from all j
portions of the grounds, attracted by
the sheet of flames that spurted fronj
the top of the cupolas, making a fat
greater fcilliancy than the illumination
of all the buildings. A wind was blow
ing from the south and the flames shot
down the northern side of the cupola
and met a sheet of flames which en- |
veloped the northern wing. Instantly \
the building was aflame from top to \
bottom in the northern half. Sparks |
were carried over the United States
Government building as far northwest l
as the Liberal Arts Palace. Bucket
brigades were hurried to the roofa of j
these buildings, preventing their igni- j
tion.
Meantime from all quarters of the 'Â¦
grounds the flre departments had re
sponded and were augmented by ap
paratua from the city department, j
Salvage corps were formed by both
Jefferson Guards and World's Fair '
visitors and as much property as could
be secured within a few moments was
carried into the Louisiana State Pa
vilion, adjacent.
Eight streams of water poured into j
the burning building with little ef- j
feet, the flre steadily eating its way \
until only a portion of the south wing
was left standing.
M. T. Davis, president of the World's
Fair Commission, was in the building !
when the explosion occurred. He ,
said:

For a caÂ«c <^f Nervous Debility. Varicoce'.e. Rheumatism, Lame Eack. Lumbago. Sciatica, any case of Kidney Disease (that has not gone as far as
Bright'* Disea&e), Indigestion. Constipation, or any weakness which I cannot cure with my new improved Electric Belt, with electric suspensory for
men (no charge), the marvel of electricians, the most wonderful curative device that has ever been introduced.
Give me a man broken down iro^j dissipation, hard wurk or worry, from any cause which has sapped his vitality. Let him follow my advice
for three months and I will make him as vigorous in every respect as any man of his age.,
1 will rot promise to make a Hercules of a man tvlio was never intended by nature to be strong and vigorous. Even that man I can make
belter than he i>; but the man who has been strong and has lost his strength I can maite as good as he ever was.
I can give back to any man what he has lost by violation of the laws of nature. I can stop all drains upon his vitality in ten days.
A man who is nervous, whose brain and body are weak, who sleeps badly, awakes more tired than when he went to bed, who is easily dis-
couraged, inclined to brood over imaginary troubles, who has lost ambition and energy to tackle hard problems, lacks the animal electricity which
the Dr. McLaaghlin Klectric Belt >uppiieÂ«.
The whole force of vitality ii your body is dependent upon your animal electricity. When you lose that by draining the system in any
manner my Belt w'til replace it and will cure you.
Mr. Merry I". Jhcksen. Va:iÂ«-ion, t.V .. Tw:tÂ»s Oct'-l*r !: â¢â¢Although you are a stranger to me, my heart warms toward you a * a srreat benefactor .and friend, and I am
more than frrsit^'u! to you. Already I f>e! the vfger of new life in my body; no aches and no pains. I wi?h you every success in your work."
Letters like that tell a story which means a great deal to a sufferer. They are a beacon light to the man who has become discouraged from
useless doctoring. 1 get such letters every day.
My Belt has a wonderful influence upon tired, weak nerves. It braces and invigorates them, and stirs up a great force of energy in a man.
I make the best electrical body appliance in the world, having devoted twenty years to perfecting it. I know my trade. My cures after
everything else has failed are my best arguments.
J. !". nafBey. in; Oak ft., t-an Francisco: "I can sp*ak a good word for your Belt. It has done all I a5kÂ»<j for It. It has cured my lame back, and when I flret cot the

Give :i;e a man with pains in his back, a dull ache in his muscles or joints, "come-and-go" pains in his shoulders, chest and side, Sciatica
â¢In his hip. Lumbago. Rheumatism, or any ache or pain, and my Belt will pour the oil of life into his aching body and drive out every sign of pain.
JCo paia can exi^t where my Belt is worn.
Mr. J. L. r^ird of Orland. Cal.. writes October 13: \"SJy back is entirely well, and I would not take $100 for my belt if I could not get another. It is the best thine on
oarih tot a lame back."
And these "old"' men. these men who have burned the candle at both ends â or even if they haven't â these men who for one reason or an-
other fee] that life has lost its spice that they are petting old too fast. I can make them feel the sparkle and fire of youth again.
I'll never forget when Mr. A. Crawford of Pokegama, Oregon, an old man of seventy, wrote to me and said: "When I wrote to you last I
told you to send me a Belt to make an old man young, and you did. I am seventy years old. and since I have worn the Belt I feel as strong as I
did at thirty-five, and can do as good a day's work as I could at that age. It was two years ago that Mr. Crawford wrote me that letter. Here is
one 1 jnst got from him:

Th.ey come eyetjp day from i-verywhore. Th^re is not a town or hamlet in the country which has not cures by Dr McLauphlin's Electric Belt.
Nov.'. what does this mean to you. dear reader? If you are not what you oiif?ht to be. can you ask any better proof to make you try it? Is there a rem-

It's as pood for women as for men. -^Vorn while you Eleep, it causes no trouble. You feel the gentle, glowing heat from It constantly, but no sting, no
burninp. as in old-style belts.

What Sulphur Does
Fcrtbo Human Body in Health and
Llseasa.
ThÂ« mention oi ealpbur.wili recall to
many of us th* early days v.heu our
mother* anÂ«i grandmothers save us our
dally dox<i of eulphar and molasses
ev*ry spring and fall.
|* It was the universal spring and fall
"blood purtfl>r," tonic and cure-all,
I and. mind you. this old-fashioned rem.
! edy waa not without merit.
The, Idea was good, but the rerrjedy
I was crude and unpalatable, and a larga
quantity had to ha taken to get any
effect.
Nowadays we get all the beneficial
i effects of sulphur In a palatable, con-
| Â«-Â«?ntratÂ«Hl form, so that a single grain
! Is far raor* effective than a tablespoon-
I ful of the crude sulphur.
In recent years, research and experi-
ment have proven that the best sulphur
for medicinal use is that obtained from
Calcium (Calcium Sulphide) and sold
in drug stores under the name of
i Stuart's Calcium Wafers. They ara
i small chocolate coated pellets and con-
j tain the active medicinal principle of
sulphur in a highly concentrated, ef-
fective form. -
Few people are atvare of the value o*
I this form of sulphur in restoring and
[maintaining bodily vigor and health:
; sulphur acts directly on the liver, and
I excretory organs and purifies and en-
! riches the blood by the prompt elimina-
tion of waste material.
Our grandmothers knew this when
I they dosed us with sulphur and nolai-
) ses every spring and fall, but the cru-
j dity and impurity of ordinary flowers
j of sulphur were often woraa than the
I disease, ar.d cannot compare with th*
I modern concentrated preparations of
I sulphur, of which Stuart's Calcium
! Wafers Is undoubtedly tha best and
I most widely used.
They are the natural antidote for
liver and kidney troubles and curÂ© con-
stipation and purify the blood fn a way
that often surprises patient and physi-
cian alike.
Dr. R. M. Willdns while experiment-
ing with sulphur remedies soon found
that the sulphur from Calcium was su-
perior to any other form. He says:
"For liver, kidney and blood troubles,
especially when resulting from constl-
i pation or malaria, I have been sur-
prised at the results obtained from
j Stuart's Calcium Wafers. In patients
suffering from boils and pimples and
even deep-seated carbuncles. I have re-
peatedly seen them dry up and disap-
pear In four or five days. leaving the
i skin clear and smooth. Although
! Stuart's Calcium Wafers is a proprie-
tary article, and sold by drujrsists. and
for that reason tabooed by many physi-
' cians. yet I know of nothing so safe
and reliable for constipation, liver and
: kidney troubles and especially In all
forms of skin disease as thia remedy."
At any rat* people who are tired bf
pills, cathartics and so-called blood
'purifiers." will find in Stuart's Cal-
cium Wafers a far safer, more palat-
able and effective preparation.

to the Supervisors that an ordinance
be passed making It a misdemeanor
for any one to adulterate cream by
putting In borax. The Legislature at
its next session will also be asked to

ship's present illness has caused as
much anxiety to the Queen as if she
.had been one of her own daughters.
She was daily in communication with
Walmer Castle and every morning
brought letters of sympathy and hope
from Princess Victoria. The contents
of these and the cablegrams from her
mother were the only personal corre
spondence which Lady Curzon's doctors
allowed to be delivered at her beside

LONDON, Nov. 19.â From a friend
of Lady. Curzon I have just heard how
the friendship between the American
Vicereine of India and Queen Alexan
dra, which has been so much comment
ed upon, came about. It seems that the
simplic.ty of her character commended
Lady Curzon first to Princess Victo
ria, the Queen's daughter, who is her
self a sort of free and easy sort of per
son. Before the Chicago girl's depart
ure for India and in the intervals which
she was able to appear in England,
l'rlncess Victoria was constantly solic
iting the companionship of Lady Cur
zon. When the Curzons lived at the
"Priory" at Reigate, the Princess often
would come down from London and
after having lunch join Lady Curzon
In a drive through the country. The
Princess would be known on such oc
casions as "Miss MacPherson of Aber

LONDON, Nov. 19.â In order to avoid
a winter voyage, the Royal Zoological
Society of Ireland does not propose to
send out until the early spring two
young lions which it is going to pre
sent to the New York Zoo. The society
has not definitely decided whether to
send out the two cubs, now two months
old", or wait for another pair. The de
sire of the society is to send the
healthiest cubs possible and as the
youngsters that are expected will be
the progeny of . a couple which have
lived out of doors for three years,- night
and day, during winter and summer,
it is anticipated they will oe excep

matic changes. In any case two lions
will be sent out in the spring under the
care of one of the best keepers.

George M. Graham, a boxmaker at a
plant in Armourdale, made the fore
going statement to-day. It was not
said in a boasting tone, but in a man
ner that left no doubt that Graham
was sincere in his conviction that he
should now be absolute master of vast
estates in Scotland.
LONDON, Nov. 19.â Robert Barclay
AHardice, whose claim to the earldoms
of Strathern. Mentelth and Alrth, ln
the peerage of Scotland, will be heard
in the next session of the House of
Lords, will be opposed by George G.
Marshall Graham of Kansas City,
whose interests in England are repre
sented by his cousin, W. M. Graham
Easton. Graham, who was born In
Edinburgh on November 18, 1852. is the
eldest surviving son of the late James
Graham of Leitchtown, Menteith,
Perthshire. The earldom of Strathern
dates from 1371, and the earldoms of
Airth and Menteith from 1633 and 1472,
respectively.
Barclay Allardlce is an alderman of
Lochnithlel, Cornwall, and eldest son of
the late Samuel Ritchie by his mar
riage with Margaret Barclay Allardlce,
whose name the claimant assumed by
royal license in 1888. The titles have
passed through many vicissitudes,
causing the present tangle. James I
of Scotland started the trouble in 1427
by depriving the then Earl of Strath
ern of his earldom because of the lat
ter's claim to royal descent.
In 1633 the seventh holder claimed his
title and asserted that he was of purer
descent than Charles I, who then oc
cupied the throne. His action nearly
ended fatally, but King Charles set
tled the matter temporarily with a new
titleâ Earl of Airth. It is claimed by
Barclay Allardlce that the Grahams, of
Gartmore, are now extinct and that the
way is thus left clear for himself.
KANSAS CITY. Nov. 19.â "I am of

Know the Vnluc of Pyramid pile Cure.
"Gratitude alone prompts me to tes-
tify to the efflcacy of Pyramid Pile
Cure. Last March I bought a dollar I
package at the drugstore, which cured
me of bleeding piles, and I -was a suf-
ferer from them for eight years; but 1
had not been troubled with them since
until last September, when I. gave birth
to a baby girl, and after that I had a
very severe case of protruding piles,
which a trained nurse said was the j
worst case she ever saw, and my doctor
told me to get Pyramid Pile Cure again
which I did and was completely cured
ln three days. I have not had piles of
ony kind since, and It is all owing to
this wonderful remedy. My nurse took
a box. which I was glad to- be able to
give her, for I know she will be able
to help lots of suffering people whom I
could never see or know.
"I recommend 'Pyramids* wherever I
know of any one suffering as I did. It
gives me great pleasure to be able to
say I am entirely cured, which my doc-
tor says is true. I say God bless Pyra-
mid Pile Cure." From a former great
sufferer. Mrs. F. S. Ancott, 1206 Unity

This remedy, which is sold by, drug-
gists generally, In fifty cent and dol-

is applied directly to the parts affected
and performs its work quietly and

Wedding Invitations.
The Scholars' Club, composed of
superintendents and principals of the
various schools in the bay counties,
held its annual banquet- at the Cali
fornia Hotel last evening. Among the
subjects discussed during the evening
was the promotion of pupils.'; J. W.
McClymonds of Oakland advocated
that there' should be no fixed time for
this,, claiming;, that a better method
for advancing children in their studies
â¢would be to leave the matter to the
School Teachers Meet.
Franklin K. Lane followed Dr. Evans
with an eloquent address upon the pur
poses of the institution." "Roosevelt's
words against race suicide," he said,
"are not all that can be said regarding
this problem. It is as necessary that
the child be preserved as it is that it
be given birth. And when you see these
little ones, that you have . saved grow
to manhood and womanhood a blessing
will come upon you that, money ' can
not buy." .
At the conclusion of Lane's address
Rev. Dr. Evans delivered a prayer and
then dedicated the building to its
Christian purpose. ,.
The San Francisco â¢ Nursery for
Homeless Children was founded thirty
years ago. In 1892 it enlarged its scope
and incorporated. Then the building
now in course of construction was pro
jected. Its site, which cost $12,000, is a
block square, and the building, which
will be of gray stone and pressed brick,
will cost about: $40,000.
"To the service of God and humanity
I dedicate this institution," said Rev.
Dr. David Evans of Gra.ce Church yes
terday afternoon as the cornerstone of
the splendid; building that will house
the wards of . the San Francisco Nur
sery for Homeless Children was lower
ed slowly into, place. In the corner
stone had been placed by Mrs. Jacob
Bertz, president of the home, a tin box
containing the daily and weekly pa
pers, a record of the home and silver
coina of the last issue. A note told
that on the day the stone was laid gold
coins were in common circulation, but
in view of the nature of the institution
such coins were not placed in the box
because they could be of infinitely more
use outside than inside- the corner
stone.
Early In the afternoon the philan
thropic people of the city that are di
rectly interested in the home began to
gather on its site at Fourteenth avenua
and Lake street. Then came half a
hundred little childrenâ the wards of
the home that .were old enough to be
out. They strewed flowers and ferns
along the mortar-covered walks ' as
they marched up to see the stone low
ered to its place. This was a little cere
mony of their own, more eloquent, how
ever, to many than the formal cere
mony of their guardians.
The Rev.' Dr. David. Evans delivered
the opening remarks and then called
for contributions. In a momenta snug
pile of gold was placed on the corner
stone, the first piece being placed there
by the minister himself. He said that
in all of San Francisco no minister
could have been found more in sym
pathy with the purpose of the Institu
tion than, he, because In early youth
he had been bereaved of his parents
and for nine years lived in such a
home. "To that home I owe all I have
and all I am," he said, "and so. my
heart beats strongly for such chari
ties." Â¦ ,.. â¢'Â¦â¢ Â¦ &
With reference to methods of getting
rid of rats, the London Globe remarks:
"It is hardly likely that the dish will
ever become a popular one, but It is
an undoubted fact that in Stafford
shire rat pie and rat stew are largely
devoured."
The best some men . can do Is to
place themselves on self-made pedes
tals.

Â¦ ..An overturned coal oil lamp in .the
residence of M. E. Elsworth at 3102
California street yesterday resulted in
slight injuries to Mrs. Elsworth and
Hoseman' Ed Moran of Engine Com
pany 23. Mrs. Elsworth was burned
about the hands and arms. The lady
attempted to extinguish the flames,
which were ignated while she was
cleaning out a closet, in which the
lamp was accidently upset. Moran
was caught by a flare of fire and
slightly burned about the hands and
face. He was treated at the Park Re
ceiving Hospital. The damage to the
property was trifling.

Miss Fanny M. Colby, who was daz
zled by an acquaintanceship with Miss'
Dorothy Morton, the actress, and to
entertain her squandered funds be
longing to the firm by which she was
employed as bookkeeper, is In San Di
ego, seeking the assistance of her
mother to make good the shortage.
Miss Colby left San Francisco Friday
evening on the train Miss Morton took
for the south, where she will Join the
"Glittering? Gloria" â¢ company.
There were not many developments
in the case yesterday. Experts are at
work on the books of Lercari, Pera &
Co., the produce firm of which Miss
Colby was a trusted employe. The
bookkeeper confessed her guilt before
she started for Los Angeles, but said
the amount she had misappropriated
was not more than $3100. It is likely
that after an examination of the books
her estimate will be found to be cor
rect.
The Morse agency is handling: the
case and detectives have accompanied
Miss Colby to Lob Angeles. She will
not be placed under arrest for the time
being, unless she attempts to leave the
State. If Lercari, Pera & Co. are re
imbursed she' will not be charged.
Among the -friends that Miss Colby
treated to automobile rides were Mr,
and Mrs. Jack Pierce, who also had
apartments in the Chesterfield, on Bush
street. But their \ acquaintance was
only casual and was soon dropped.
Mrs. Palmer, one* of the landladies of
the Chesterfield, has been a stanch
friend of Miss~Colby, not' believing- her
to be mentally responsible. Mrs. Pal
mer is also an intimate friend of Su
pervisor-John Connor, who' procured
the ' position of bookkeeper for Miss
Colby. He had also obtained a tempo
rary position for her in the City Hall.
When â¢ she ! admitted the shortage.
Miss Colby exclaimed with' a sigh of
regret, "It went so fast that I cannot
Â¦really tell what became of it." She is
about 30 years of age. The detectives
agree that she is 'not sound mentally.
Former â¢ employes of Fischer's give
more light on the attentions Miss Colby
paid to Miss Morton. It appears that
every night for about three weeks Miss
Colby sent handsome bouquets to the
actress anQ the only writing on the
card was "A Well Wisher." Miss Mor
ton's curiosity led her to ascertain who
her friend was and then the acquain
tanceship was* made.
While it Is admitted that Miss Mor
ton was lavishly entertained by the
bookkeeper; who represented herself as
having an Interest Â¦ in Â¦'; the business of
the firm, it* Is denied that the actress
accepted any- gifts." Â¦

WISH ONE WORD OMITTED.
These paragraphs might well be
omitted.
"But the injustice to women might
be averted if only the word 'sex' were
stricken from the paragraphs. The
pioneer women of the West, who have
labored and suffered' by their hus
bands' sides to .advance civilization,
ought . not to be so unjustly classed,
with felons, lunatics Â» and children,
while their own husbands, equals in
other respects, are enfranchised. The
Congress of the- United States ought
not to set its seal upon the possibility
of the perpetual disfranchisement of
these women, an unmerited disgrace
and punishment. It is true that in
many States women have been taeJt
ly ranked with these. defectives, delin
quent and dependent classes, but
never before has the insult been so
open and flagrant, nor has it been in
an act of Congress. -â¢
"The representative of the United
States Government, the Territorial
Governor of Arizona, once before in
terfered in Arizona legislation to the
defeat of women by vetoing the
woman suffrage bill passed by the
Legislature of Arizona.
"The women of all our great coun
try should now protest against the
women of the Southwest Jieing ranked
with the classes justly disfranchised,
any other member of which may by
effort, behavior or lapse of time,
achieve enfranchisement.
"There maybe other objections to
this part of the bill, that Congress
gratuitously interferes to forbid negro
di^franchisement, or disfranchisement
"tor any other conditions or qualifica
tions,' which latter will prevent dis
franchisement for lack of United
SUles citizenship, a prohibition never
before laid on a State. This wording
will be interpreted by some as even
prohibiting; the future enfranchise
ment of women in these new States.
"The bill proposes to unite Oklahoma
and Ir.diaa Territory into one State
under the name of Oklahoma, and to
combine New Mexico and Arizona Ter
ritories Into a State under the name
of Arizona. This measure . has passed
the Lower House of Congress, has been
read twice' In the Senate and is now
before the Senate Committee on Terri
tories, of which Senator Albert J. Bev
t-ridge is chairman, and the following
named Senators are also members:
William P. Dillingham, Knute Nelson,
Thomas? R. Bard, Henry E. Burnham,
John Kean, "William B. Bate. Thomas
M. Patterson. James P. Clarke and
Francis G. Newlands. Now is the time
to amend, while the bill is in com
mittee.
OBJECTIONABLE PARAGRAPH.
"The portion of the bill threatening
injustice to the women in the proposed
n-?w Svates is found in paragraphs 5 of
sections 3 and 21, which would allow
these States, when organized, to dis
franchise minors, criminals, luna
tics, non-residents, ignoramuses and
WOMEN. This part of the bill reads
as follu-.vs:
' Fifthâ That said Â£Jte shall never
enact any law restricting r abridging
the right of suffrage on account of
race, color, or previous condition of
servitude, . or on account of any other
conditions or qualifications, save and
except on account of illiteracy, minor
ity, sex. conviction of felony, mental
condition, or residence: provided, how
ever, that any such restrictions shall be
made uniform and applicable alike to
all citizens/
'â¢Dear Madamâ A bill is now pending
in Congress which so vitally affects
the interests of women in the great
Southwest that we believe you and
your organization would like to pro
test against the injustice therein
thre?t<Â»ned our sisters.
A strong; letter is beirrj? sent lo mem
bers of women's clubs and others

bill now pending in. Congress. This bill
proposes the union of Oklahoma

NEW YORK. Nov. 19.â To-day's
stock market contested the reaction
ary tendency which 'developed yester
day, but prices showed a reluctance to
advance. There v.as a sprightly up
ward movement after the appearance
of the bank statement, but it was not
held, and the closing was irregular
and generally below the best. During
the first hour many prominent stocks
went below last night's level. The
bank statement seemed to reassure
sentiment to some extent. The decline
In cash was rather larger than indi
cated by the week's currency move
ment, but the Van- contraction reduced
the deposits and the reserve require
ments so as to raise the surplus
slightly. But some misgiving over the
money outlook was reflected In the
late renewal of the pressure to Bell.
The bank statement reflects this
week's gold outgo to France only In
part, owing to the average system of
c&nputation. To-day's shipments, both
to Paris and to Cuba, are not reflected
at all, and go over to next week's
statement.
The bespeaking: of all available gold
bars at the assay office for export to
France next week shows the unsatis
fied requirements from that source, and
the $1,500,000 shipment arranged for
next week to Cuba Is also to be reck
oned with.
The loan contraction was* not unex
pected, but only because the effect of
trust company operations upon the loan
account of Jhe banks Is known from
abundant precedent. x
It is obvious that the week 'hag made
large encroachments on the available
supply of loanable funds by reason of
the active speculation In the stock
market, as â¢well as for subscriptions to
the $30,000,000 of the Japanese loan and
the purchase of $25,000,000 of Rock Isl
and bonds. The closing tone was ir
regular.
â¢ Total sales of bonds, $4,780,000.
The news of the week has offered
much to confirm the expectations that
business and Industry would be stimu
lated by the passing of the election
contest. In the stock market there
have been traces of hesitation based
upon the doubt whether the extensive
rise In prices of securities which pre
ceded the election had not been .suf
ficient to cover the enhancement of
values based on improvement of busi
ness." Very heavy selling to take
profits has been the evidence of this
apprehension and this has caused oc
casional irregularity. But the ab
sorptive power of the market had the
effect of dissipating the fears of specu
lators to a large extent, And the lat
ter part of the week showed a revival
of speculative confidence and some
sensational adva/ices In market values
as a consequence of a rush to buy cer
tain stocks. .
Bonds were very active, but business
was still largely in speculative issues.
United States bonds were unchanged
on call for the week.

LIBRARY ASSOCIATION
MEETS IX SACRA3EEXTO
Â¦ Mrs. Frederick Allardt and Miss Lot
tie Allardt are planning to entertain at
cards next week. -
Mrs. Jennie E. Manuel of this city
and George W. Klopp, a business man
of San * Francisco,- were married this
morning at the bride's home on Four
teenth street, by Rev. Charles T. Walk
ley of St. Paul's. The bride Is the sister
of Mrs. , Charles r H. Rowe.
Mr. and % Mrs. Klopp^will live In San
Francisco, "and after December 1 will
be at home at 705 Van Ness avenue.
The bride is a daughter of Dr. and
Mrs. R. A. Summers. The groom is In
charge of transportation of the North
ern Commercial Company.
Misses Beulah and Miriam Summers,
In \whlte, attended their sister and led
the way to, the bridal bower, unfolding
long garlands of smilax as they went,
thus forming an aisle. The bride was
escorted by both father and mother, an
Innovation seemed to give an
unusual sacredness to the nuptial bless
ing. Mrs. Summers was handsomely
gowned in white and carried pink roses.
Rev. E. S. Williams of Saratoga; an
old friend of Mr. Kincaid, read the
Episcopal marriage service and the
groom was attended by William H.
Jordan Jr.
On their return from their honey
moon trip,- Mr. and Mrs. Kincaid will
reside at. the Hotel Touraine for the
winter.
A blonde of an unusually fair type,
with pale, Bilvery hair, the bride was
a charming picture in her gown of
chiffon satin. The decoration of the
skirt was unique, shirred satin bands
forming "sunbursts," In the heart 'of
each being a chiffon rose. The long
train was outlined with a wide puff.
Rare lace and diminutive sunbursts
ornamented the^- corsage, and over all
fell the long veil that swept to the very
hem of the train. Orange blossoms
from the south- covered the bride's
beautiful hair and she carried a shower
of snowy roses.. "
The wedding this evening of Miss
Julia Summers and William Kincaid,
though a simple home affair, was one
of the prettiest nuptial events of the
year. The decorations of the resi
dence on Hobart street, the handiwork
of the bride's friends, to their credit be
it said, were graceful and delightful
ly . artistic. Portieres of smilax were
draped over each door, and the fairy
like bower where the lovers plighted
their troth was also of smilax. Pink
blossoms were arranged canopylike in
the front drawing-room, and every
where the effect, in pale pink and ten
der green, was dainty as the petite
bride herself. ; ;
Many musical events. In spite of the
auditorium handicap, are being ar
ranged for this winter, but they are all
rather "up In the air" as to dates,' the
projectors seeming to hope against
hope that a suitable hall will suddenly
fall from the clouds. Mrs. Henry
Weatherbee â that always " enthusiastic
patroness of the artsâIs engineering a
couple of operatic affairs for "charity's
sweet sake" that promise to be enjoy
able events of the new year. That old
favorite, "Pinafore," has been dusted
off and given over to the tender mer
cies of a number of young society girls
and men, who have already established
a reputation as clever amateurs. Many
of them have good voices as well as
talents, and when one glances over the
names of the participants â Misses
Marietta Havens, Crissie Taft, Pauline
Fore, Gertrude Gould, Joe Rosborough
and others of that ilkâ one's expectant
hopes rise buoyantly and we eagerly
await the production of "Pinafore," for
we know it is- bound to be good.
A little bird also whispers that Mrs.
Weatherbee is planning to give "Es
meralda," with dainty, winsome Laura
Sanborn in the leading part. Let ts
hope the report is true.
OAKLAND, Nov. 19.â The crying
need of Oakland for an auditorium was
never better exemplified than at the
Redfield concert last night. Maple Hall
is a pretty, comfortable and convenient
place of meeting, but was never in
tended as a music hall. A delightful
programme had been prepared by Mr.
Redfield and the musicians who as
sisted him, and Maple Hall was crowd
ed with his many friends and admirers,
who appreciated the fact that a treat
was in store and had come to enjoy it.
But two or three of the finest numbers
were almost spoiled by the "noise of
dancing feet overhead. Then again,
the acoustics are not good. But what
are we to do? There is no more musical
town in the State than Oakland, and.
we have not a single hall where a con
cert can be given with anything like
satisfaction to, either audience or pro
grammers.
The Home Club is an ideal auditor
ium, but would be too small if in the
heart of town. Perhaps some day some
one v/lth F. M. Smith'3 progressive
spirit and love of the beautiful will
awake to Oakland's need and give us
a building that will inspire every lover
of music with ~ gratitude so long as
stone rests upon stone.

Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1016 Broadway, Nov. 19.
"Most certainly these men are being
punished, and with greater severity
than any judge or Jury could inflict
upon them. Punished with the mental
torture that comes with the conscious
ness of guilt, by the shame and dis
grace that is being "heaped upon their
mothers, wives and little children, by
the contempt that is rightfully
visited upon ' them by good citi
zens, neighbors and friends, in
the realization that a life's work has
been thrown away and the black stain
of theft will hang over them until the
shadows of the eternal land will en
velop them with its everlasting night."
Proseculing Attorney A. P. Leach
has prepared complaints for each of the
four policemen, Clark, Andrews, Stahl
and Hamilton, dismissed from the^orce
by the Police Commissioners. He says
he will Issue warrants for the arrest of
the men as soon as some person suf
ficiently Interested will sign them. "I
do not think the evidence thus far
presented sufficient to warrant convic
tion," he said, "but am ready to pro
ceed as soon as some one will assume
the responsibility." ;
Police Captain W. J. Petersen has
published a signed letter in .which he
deprecates the unsparing criticism
given to the men. He says:
"While with invective, contempt and
horror our good citizens speak of the
men who, under the cover of their uni
forms, robbed those whom they had
sworn to protect, It might be well to
stop a moment and think before giving
vent toVighteous indignation.
"The police of our cities ar5 placed in
more kinds of temptation than any
ot^ier vocation I know of. When our
good citizens will take more Interest
in their police department, when they
get behind good men for officers, there
will be less cause for complaint th.an
there Is at present.

Townsend, the star witness for the
State, fainted when sentence to death
was pronounced upon Gorman, Rob
erts and Sevener, the convicted mur
derers of Jack Welch.
Townsend had been an interested
spectator up to the time when- Judge
Curler pronounced the words: "You
shall hang until you are dead." Town
send then threw up his arms and fell
to the floor in a faint. Townsend,
who was with Jack Welch when he
vas murdered, was a witness to the
crime and gave the evidence that con
victed the men o'f murder.
SEXTEN'CE OF DEATH
PASSED OX MURDERERS
After dressing Sheffield's wounds
Dr. Larkey requested the police to re
move the patient to the Receiving
Hospital. The authorities refused to
do this on the ground that it was not
an emergency case. Dr. Larkey was
Indignant at the refusal of the police
to act and scored them severely for
stupidity. He says that when the
patrol wason arrived the policeman
in charge said he had no authority to
remove the patient.
Derpondent over continued 111
health and because he had been ar
rested on a charge of embezzlement,
E. R. Sheffield, formerly a clerk in
the office of County Assessor Dalton,
made an rftempt to end his life about
9 o'clock this mornine at the Hotel
Touraine. He slashed his left arm in
four places -with a razor, but quickly
repented of his rash act and sent for
Dr. A. S. Larkey. who arrived Just
in time to save the would-be suicide's
life.
Sheffield, who is well known among
iAIameda County politicians, was ar
rested on September 1 on a warrant
from San Francisco charging him with
misdemeanor embezzlement. The dis
grace of arrest combined with de
spondency because of ill health is
thought to have been the cause of Mis
attempt at self-destruction.
As soon as Sheffield's wounds were
dressed he was removed to Fabiola
Hospital. It is not thought his in
juries will result fatally.
Mrs. N. K. Dunning, landlady of the
Hotel Touraine, knows nothing of
Sheffield except that he came to the
hotel at midnight last Thursday and
remained in his room all day yester
day.

hair becomes brittle and
falls out and baldness is
the inevitable result.

every trace of dandruff.

disorders), and -will . v

Rheumatism.
If you zre suffering from rheuma-
tism there is a chance for you to be-
come absolutely cured. You may
cure yourself and do it quickly if you
will lay aside your prejudice and
skepticism.
Every San Francisco druggist sells
Uricsol, the well-known remedy, and
we hereby authorize them to guaran-
tee a cure.
Urusol cures rheumatism in the only
possible way it can be cured.
Uric Acid and Urates are the cause
of Rheumatism. These are deposited
in the tissues, blood .vessels and joints
of the body.
These deposits must be dissolved
and eliminated from the system be-
fore a cure can be accomplished.
Uricsol is a solvent of these and
tones up the system, stimulates the
kidneys, liver ..nd bowel:, and thus
drives them from the system. .
Uricsol is harmless, and no injuri-
ous results can possibly come to any
part of your body.

Mrs. Halvorson conducts a lodging
house at 816 McAllister street and
Hammond was one of her lodgers. The

concealed the money in an old valise

j secured it. When arrested he had
$151 50 in his purse and a gold watch,
valued at $18, which he says he pur
chased yesterday. He admits that the
coin in his possession is the property
of Mrs. Halvorson, but refuses to state
how he disposed of the remainder.

A motion for nonsuit was made
and denied and then the defense
commenced its proof in favor of Lum
Quoia, the woman In Chinatown who
claims to be the widow, but who is
said to have been only the slave of
Quoia. C. W. Dorr, secretary and
counsel for the Alaska Packers' Asso
ciation, testified that he had- often
visited Quoia's home on business and
that Lum Quoia had been introduced
and referred to by the contractor as
his wife. On the Sunday before he
died Quoia sent for Dorr and asked
him to see to it that Lum and his two
children grot what was coming to them
from the association. John WÂ« Wen
den, who was employed by the Chin
aman to guard the ships before they
sailed for Alaska with the contract
laborers, said that he visited Quoia's
house nearly every day and from the
first Lum Quoia was referred to as the
wife. The hearing will be resumed
to-morrow.

The principal business of the Na

ring of degrees. The seventh national
degree was conferred upon more than
1000 members, and the fifth and sixth
degrees upon several hundred.
I PORTLAND. Nov. 19.â The report of
j the executive committee of the N'aiion
! al Grange, which Js now In session in
| this city shows that the affairs of the
(organization are in a prosperous condi
j tion. The total amount of property
â¢ owned by the Grange at present is
j valued at $30,600, an increase of 59,293 57
j over last year.
; The executive committee thinks that
the pov.ers now conferred upon the In
terstate Commerce Commission are not
| ample s enough and the legislation
i necessary to enlarse its powers is rec
' ommended. The report indorses the
! parcels posts, and condemns the effort
i being made to repeal the Grout oleo
' margarine bill. The committee recom
jSnends that the Grange adopt resolu
! tlcns at this session favoring direct
i election of United States Senators. The
! report closes by reindorsing Congress
! man CurrieÂ«Â« bill providing: for Federal
! aid in building roads, which is before
i Congress, and In emphatic terms de
j.nounccs the trusts and urges the in
j'dorsement of present laws and the en
! acting of new ones necessary to that
i end.

Judge Mogan dismissed the battery

witness, Sam Bowley. notified the
court that he had decided to refrain
from prosecuting. Bowley's skull was

in Stlckel's room In the Geary street
lodging house managed by Mrs. Mowry.

that Stickel was his assailant, the
woman claimed that It was she who

Barney Hoffman and George Elstrom,
each about twenty years of age, were
burglarizing a telephone box in a
Powell street saloon whe'n an alarm at
tached to the lock notified the pro
prietor of the place, and he caught the
young cracksmen fairly in the act. In
Judge Mogan's court it was shown that
Master Hoffman recently completed a
six months' term of imprisonment, re-
repeated continuances of your case
were made for the purpose of prevent
ing a renewal of your attack upon the
complaining witness. If you insist up
on being 1 sentenced, however, I must
accommodate you."
"I'm tired of being hounded by the
complainant and his friends," exclaim
ed the woman, and would have said
more if the" bailiff had not silenced
'her.

During the recent political cam
paign Morris Rosenbaum listened to
spellbinding speeches until he became
inoculated with the bacilli of jawltls
and so completely did the habit, en
slave him that he could not break
away from it after election. That was
his excuse for loudly haranguing an
"But you say he struck three men?"
"Struck 'em for "moneyâ struck 'em
for money,".- explained the peace
guardian.
"It's a stand-off between your am
biguity and my obtuseness," said his
Honor to the complainant. Then to
the cringing defendant: "Three strikes
have been called. You're out. Get
out."
"I Biiw him strike three â¢ different
men on Kearny street, between Clay
and Sacramento." â¢'
"But the charge is not battery," re
marked the Judge.\ . ;
"I know it ain't â it's begging," said
the officer.
When the shrinking tatterdemalion
accused of street begging stood up
before Judge Cabaniss the prosecut
inp policeman said:
Jean Pon, who has figured conspicu
ously in connection with the manage
ment of the notorious 1129 Dupont
street, was charged before Judge Mo
gan with having maliciously broken a
window of the restaurant which is a
part of those disreputable premises.
He pleaded great provocation, aver
ring that after being utilized as a cats
paw and a stalking horse and several
other things by Messrs. Marlscano and
Bellinger, owners of 1129. they re
warded his services by throwing him
out of the cafe that yielded him a live
lihood. Frenzied by their ingratitude,
to say nothing of the spleen aroused
by their rough handling of him, he
smashed the glass. Judge Mosran.will
hear further details next Wednesday.
Another feminine figure familiar in
the Hall of Justice corridors was that
of Laura Traver, alias Laura Le Seer.
She, too, is accused of felony embez
zlement, the complainant being the
manager of an insurance firm, who al
leged that she endeavored to collect
the premium on a pianoforte which
she claimed to have been destroyed by
fire, whereas the Instrument was re
moved and concealed somewhere prior
to the conflagration. Judge Fritz will
hear testimony next Wednesday and
the woman will probably conduct her
own case, as she always has done,
whether she appeared as complainant
or defendant.
Discovery of a flaw in the formal
complaint against Miss Lena M. Wal
ton temporarily relieved her of the
charge of obtaining money under false
pretenses that was filed last August.
The clerical defect was quickly rem
edied, however, and the case will be
heard by Judge Fritz to-morrow.
The defendant is known also as "the
Hetty Green of Alaska" and "the
Queen of Nome," and the felony
charge is the outcome of a mining
deal in which she participated. She
cut something of a swath in the local
police news about three months ago
and recently returned from Washing
ton. D. C, with, it is alleged, the of
ficial scalps of several Alaskan place
holders dangling from her waist
band.
Sixteen-year-old Julia Hart, charged
with incorrigibillty, told Judge Conlan
that she did not care what became of
her, but she did object to having Wal
ter Lyons' name flaunted in the pub
lic prints.
"Just because I lost my Job and
couldn't get another," said Julia, "my
father and that mean thing, Belle Bal
len, put up the Job that has landed
me here. Walter is a salesman in Oak
land and I â¢ don't want to have him
lose his job, too. We have been keep
ing company about three months, and
a more perfect gentleman I never met.
I think Belle Ballen's Jealous because
she couldn't catch Walter or any fel
low as nice as him."
The girl was arrested in compliance
with her father's complaint that she
had left her home at 310 Eleventh
street and was occuplng an apartment
with the young man whose "job" she
was so solicitous to preserve. She is
held for further inquiry as to the ex
tent of Mr. Lyons' responsibility for
her waywardness.
Judge Cabaniss dismissed Louis Par
ra's charge of embezzlement against
Miss May Mahena, who prefers that she
be called Miss Gladys Freeman, because
it is a much prettier name. In support
of his accusation Mr. Parra produced
a document purporting to be the young
woman's written promise to return to
him on demand a pair of diamond ear
screws which he had Intrusted to her
keeping, but Handwriting Analysist
Kytka opined that the signature at
tached thereto was not made by her
fair hand. Now retaliative proceedings
are threatened.
â¢ â¢ â¢
Police Judge , Mogan decided that
Mrs. Miller, a middle-aged lady of
Amazonian demeanor, was primarily
responsible for the battery charge on
which her son James, was arrested, but
as she was not formally accused of the
offense her offspring must serve as a
vicarious sacrifice to the ends of
justice.
It was Droved that James had as
saulted M. Sextus of 3138 Pierce street
at 5 o'clock on the afterno"on*of Friday,
November 11, and the defense pleaded
provocation more than ample to Justify
the battery. Mrs. Miller and her young
daughter, It was avered, were passing
the Sextus dwelling when Mrs. Sextus,
wife of the complainant, shouted in
menacing tone: "Mrs. Miller, you'd
better prevent your daughter interfer
ing with my young daughter!"
"Whereupon, according to the prose
cution, Mrs. Miller retorted In lan
guage so profane as to shock Mrs.
Sextus and impel Mr. Sextus to emerge
from his house and sternly command
Mrs. Miller to cease her tirade. The
iittle Miller girl then ran home and told
her big brother James that Mr. Sextus
was saying awful things to her mam
ma, and James promptly responded by
rushing to the scene of hostility and
smiting Mr. Sextus' Jaw.
Various witnesses testified that the
words addressed by Mrsi Miller to Mrs.
Sextus were utterly unfit for publica
tion, and various other witnesses testi
fied that Mrs. Miller's language was
ultra-refined as compared with the oral
outpourings of both Mr. and Mrs. Sex
tus. The Judge, however, held that
Mrs. Miller was more aggressive than
her opponents in the debate, and ex
pressed regret that she was not ar
rested instead of her son, whose action
in defending his mother was entirely
filial, if unwarranted by law. â¢
Sentence was deferred till next Satur
day.
Teresa Hendry informed Judge Mo
gan that she would like to be sentenced
for the offense committed by her last
January, when she bombarded with
rocks the residence of a prominent
business man on whose attention she
professed to hold- a long-standing
claim. She had grown tired of attend
ing court at prescribed intervals, she
added, and was there and then ready
to accept whatever penalty she might
have earned.
Asked if she was prepared to go to
jail, she replied in the negative, and
explained that she wanted to be sen
tenced so that Bhe could appeal to the
Superior Court. Then she was asked
if she were ready to furnish an appeal
bond, and again she answered no. So
the Judge postponed sentence till next
Wednesday in order to afford her time
to get the sureties essential to her sal
vation from imprisonment.
"I have no desire to either fine or im
prison you," said his Honor, "and my
â¢ â¢ â¢
The charge against the young fel
low was pretty thoroughly proved by
the testimony of the girl and the phy
sicians who attended her. but her
mother would not permit her to swear
to a formal complaint because of the
undesirable notoriety It might bring
upon the family. Detective Bailey
then filed the charge, but without the
girl's co-operation the . prosecution
would be incomplete^. That the case
is as good â or as bad â as quashed
was virtually acknowledged by the
District Attorney; permitting the de
fendant's release on $10 bail.
Judge Mogan suggested marriage as
a means of remedying the wrong done
the girl, but her mother scouted the
idea.
Neither 14 -year-old Lorella Camp
bell nor her mother appeared in Judge
Slogan's court to prosecute W. A.
Prole of Oakland, charged with as
saulting the girl on the -night of No
vember 12 in Golden Gate Park, and
the case was continued one week and
the defendant admitted to bail in the
sum of $10. His liberation was cele

He had exhausted Imperialism and

GORED OF ECZEMA BY CUTICURA
I had suffered terrible agony and pain for eight long years
from a terrible eczema on the scalp and face. The best doctors
were unable to help me, and I had spent a lot of money for many
remedies without receiving any benefit. My scalp was covered
with scabs, my face was like a piece of raw beef, my eyebrows
and lashes were falling out, and sometimes I felt as if I was
burning up from the terrible itching and pain. I then began
treating myself at home, and now my head and face are clear,
and I am entirely well. I first bathed my face with Cuticura
Soap, then applied Cuticura Ointment to the afflicted parts, and
took Cuticura Resolvent for the blood. To my surprise and joy
I was greatly relieved after the first application, and continued
use of the Cuticura remedies soon made a complete cure.

Of a cough, especially of infants
and delicate children. Don't wait
until the cough becomes hard, the
throat inflamed and the lungs and
bronchial passages congested.
Avoid cough remedies that contain
opiates, stupefying drugs and dan-
gerous anodynes. They only
quiet the symptomsâ drug the
cough into silence â but that is not
curing. A weak place is left to
cause trouble later. A remedy
must be used to subdue the in-
flammation, stimulate the secre-
tions, soothe and heal the irri-
tated membranes and cure the
cough to stay cured.

without a vote, but this proposition
was defeated by the convention.

A digest of the resolutions before
the convention and the disposition
made of them tells the story of a great
part of the proceedings of the sixth
day cf the convention. The chairmen
of committees were the prominent men
in the convention yesterday.
'â¢Personally, I believe for the freedom
cf the trades union movement â that wo
ought not to have a vote; and I, of
course, concur with the committee on
that. P.ut thÂ»*re Is one thing I do be

to be understood this morning â that
you can't make fish of one and flesh
cf another If it should come up. If one
league Is recognized the other certain
ly has a right to a vote."
It was soon developed that the dele
gates did not wish to have any outside
bo-iy entitled to a vote in the conven

the most prominent delegate of her sex
in the convention. Mary OSullivan, ob
jected to the resolution. She rose di
rectly and sai<1:
'"Coming over to the convention I
said to Mr. Gompers that I did not be
lieve that this organization ought to
have a vote in the convention, and it
is not organized along bona-tide trades
union lines, but there are different parts
of thÂ» country where both leagues
are recognized with a vote. Now,
I think, we ought to have a uniform
law concerning this, and the conven
tion Is the place, I think, to settle it
now â either that we have a vote or
that we have not a vote.

floor of the federation convention. A
resolution was adversely reported that
contained the following words: "The
National Women's Trade. Union

gate with one vote."
A resolution introduced by Delegate
Westoby, favoring a conference with

Samuel Gompers. the famous leader
who has stood at the head of the labor
movement for more than a score of
years, was . given a most cordial re
ception. .
He spoke in part as follows of the
American Federation: of Labor:
"I have often responded to the toast
of the American Federation of Labor.
I feel an additional responsibility to do
it Justice with each succeeding year.
Realizing the development of our
movement I know my own inability and
littleness.
"The American Federation of Labor
âa name, a thought, a hope, typifying
and expressing the hopes of the masses
against the wrongs In modern society!
It stands for their correction.
"The federation was formed at a time
when the hopes of tollers In unity were
nearly shattered. Indifference and op
position were gradually overcome and
the little band of workers has since
been augmented . into millions, who
have implicit' confidence In themselves.
"There are many who remember the
dark days, in -Plttsburg in 1881, when
earnest. and true men met to form the
federation. But don't- Imagine that in
our advent in 1881 one saw the 'first
light of the labor movement There
were others> who had gone before, who
championed the cause; great, good and
true men, such as John Stlney, Richard
Trevelllck. William H. Sylvia, Ira Stew
art, George E; McNeil and George A.
Grant. I. could not fail to mention .the
names, of the pioneers of our move
ment."
- Mr. Gompers paid tributes to William
H. Foster, George- Chance, P. J. Mc-
Giilre,, the great .men In the labor
movements of the past. He further
praised the work, and ambitions of the
men at present working for unionism.
He especially" mentioned the members
of- the local federated bodies and the
work of California for. unification.
SAMUEL GOMPEKS' SPEECH.
'duties in the city of. my childhood I
deeply felt my responsibility, and.
knowing that organized labor as wiell
as my personality was on trial. I was
determined that no act of mine could
be pointed to as wanting either In Jus
tice, honesty or fairness to every ele
ment of our population.
'"No administration of the complex
affairs of a city like this has been
or ever, will be perfect. During my
term'Ihave tried to maintain mv
ideal â a conservative policy In which
the employer and the wasreworker
should receive equal consideration and
fair treatment. I have tried to con
duct the public business of the cltv. as*
well as ,|he relations between canital
and labor, so that, as far as lay In my
power, a friendly sentiment misrht be
created between them.
â¢ "I thought I had done much toward
accomplishing those ends, but now I
am beginning to fear that the
conflict between labor and canital, be
tween aggregated' labor and aggregated
wealth may prove eternal and irrecon
cilable.
"The other night in an adjoining ho
tel, a body of our citizens listened to
the talks of their fellow citizens on the
duties of a citizen: The orators were
selected as men entirely without sym
pathy with the wage-earners and who
could be depended on to assail any of
ficial in sympathy with the plain peo
ple and to regard neither honor nor
Justice in their references to him..
"I mention this because It was pre
meditated for political purposes, not
so much to make trouble for your rep
resentative as for the cause of labor
generally."
Governor Pardee telegraphed from El
Paso, Texas, regrets at his inability
to attend the convention.
- "It would require an entire adminis
tration to set forth the troubles of a
Labor Mayor. He meets with trouble
with his friends as well as with his
adversaries. - When 1 entered on my
Mayor Eugene E. Schmltz spoke of
"The Troubles of a Labor Mayor." He
said:
"The troubles of a labor Mayor are
but small in comaprison to the opposi
tion which the entire labor movement
has encountered from its inception
until now.
In the handsomely decorated and
brilliantly lighted banquet hall the
company was seated at ten long
tables- At the head of one of the tables
was Toastmaster Michael Casey, at his
right was .President Gompers and at
his left Mayor and Mrs. Schmltz.
There were Â¦ many entertaining
speeches during the evening, which
were listened to with rapt attention
and heartily applauded. A splendid or
chestra played while the banqueters
made merry over dainty dishes and
drank to one another's health in glasses
of California vintages.
Toastmaster Casey prefaced his re
marks to the company with reference
to his pleasant duty In welcoming so
many friends of unionism.
MAYOR SCIIMITZ TALKS.
As a fitting climax to the week's
work In the convention, its mass-meet
ings, dances and receptions, . the> two
hundred delegates of the American
Federation assembled last night at the
Lick House and there, with wives,
friends and local hosts, sat down tÂ«
a sumptuous banquet given in their
honor.
"We are of the opinion that a dec
laration of this kind, or of some kind
perhaps not quite so lengthy, would
be a proper declaration from this con
vention for the purpose of giving to
the world a message from this con
vention that we are the natural and
logical protectors of unorganized la
bor.
"It has beer, said very frequently and
truthfully that unorganized labor is
benefited by every Improvement in the
condition of ragÂ« of organized labor
end it is proper that we should make
a declaration similar to this in order
that we may be properly understood a<Â»
the natural, logical and rightful pro
tectors of the unorganized."
Quite a discussion took place over
the resolution. Incidentally the name
of Parry came up. Parry of Indianapo
lis, Â¦who head* th? Manufacturers' As
sociation and who with voice and pen
has vigorously fought the American
Federation of Labor on all possible
opportunities In the last year or two.
The resolution originated with the
Boot and Shoe Workers' Union. Del
egate Tobin, when the discussion was
getting quite warm, explained for the
Introducers of the resolution what he
conceived its scope and purpose to be.
"This reFu'.ution." said Mr. Tobin,
*'ha> be*n Introduced by the delegates
representing the union for the reason
that the Farryites. the Citizens' Alli
tuice and other similar bodies have
been contending for a long time that
they arej,he natural nrotectors of un
organized labor. They undertake to
speak for unorganized labor and to
protect^'.t in its right to sell Its labor
when and where It will.
The resolution was adversely re
ported to the convention by the com
mittee on resolutions, of which First
Vice President Duncan is the chair
man.
TbÂ« American Federation of Labor,
la convention yesterday, refused to
commit Itself to the proposition con
tained In a resolution that "'its ulti
znate object Is the attainment of eco
nomic Justice for union and non-union
l&bcr and that organized labor was
primarily and now is and will be in
futurity the first and foremost advo
cate, friend, protector and promdter
cf the rights, liberties, opportunities
anfi Interests of organized or unor
ganized, union or non-union labor."

i Supervisor James P. Booth of the

sociation" was called to the chair to
preside; .In courtesy to that organiza
tion. It has been defeated in its pur
poses, and day. before yesterday Its
directors met and decided to turn over
Professor William R. Dudley, head of
the botanical department at Stan
ford, pointed out that the practical
value of preserving the park should be
Impressed on the business men of. San
Francisco. The grove of redwoods at
the door of the city would always be
an attraction that could be advertised
with much success to bring tourists
and visitors. The grove could be placed
with other scenic attractions of the
State that are boasted the world over.
Charles Keeler, the poet, came from
Berkeley to assist the women In start
ing their project. He thought it about
time to cease apologizing for sentiment
to the business man. The greatest
need of the world to-day, he said. 13
wholesome, hearty sentiment for good
things and beautiful things. He did not
believe" In making appeal to the hard
head**! business man solely on prac
tical grounds. He urged that the senti
mental side of protecting thÂ« forests
and beautiful things should be pre
sented to them as well. The Redwood
or Sequoia Park in Marin. he hoped,
would be saved to posterity as a great
temple where beauty worshipers might
find happy hours.
Emil Pohli explained the proposal of
the water company. Included in its of
ler is the water-shed of Mount Tamal
pais, which must be preserved . for the
corporation's purpose and its streams
not contaminated. The canyon proper
embraces about Â£29 acres, but the ad
dition of the slope of Mount Tamalpais
will make a reservation of -about 1300
acres. No aid could be expected from
the Federal, State or municipal .gov
ernments, he explained, and the only
course left was that of popular sub
scription.
TO PLAN ORGANIZATION 1 !
HAS PRACTICAL VALUE.
She told briefly but very effectively
of the beauties of the wonderful can
yon that runs southwest from the foot
of Tamalpais to the sea. Her word
painting: was excellent, and as a cam
paign speech in behalf of the beloved
redwoods her remarks commended
themselves for future endeavors to
arouse the public. She pleaded for the
beautiful trees, for the perennial
stream that courses down the canyon
between banks heavy with the tangled
growth of wax myrtle, azalias and
ferns. Besides the redwoods there are
spruce, California nutmeg, maple,
alder, water holly, hazelâ all In a
flourishing race for the supremacy .of
the Jungle. The carpets of wild flow
en (there are flowers In all the sea
sons) were described, and when the
speaker concluded her audience was
stirred to greater enthusiasm.
The North Coast Water Company
owns the forest at the present thne.
With worthy purpose it has kept the
grove intact for many years. But re
cently an offer has been mads by a
firm that would ruthlessly cut the
trees and saw them into valuable lum
ber. The water company has stock
holders anxious for dividends and the
directors were compelled to take ac
tion. They are eager, however, to
have the ft>rest preserved and will a^ 1
low what latitude they can for any
steps afoot toward" this object.
. Mrs. Emil Pohll, chairman of the
forestry section of the California
Club, ascertained that the canyon
could be purchased for JSO.OOO and
she and her colleagues decided to In
augurate a movement in which senti
ment and love of nature should have
p practical battle with rough commer
cialism. Mrs. Pohli called a meeting
of representatives from every woman's
organization in the city and other so
cieties about the bay for yesterday
morning and the attendance indicated
Uiat the forestry section had never
taken up a work that met more gen
eral approval.
"Ther^ Is only one reason why I wish
I had $1,000,000." declared Miss Alice
Eastwood. "The only thing I want
that amount of money for is .to buy
Redwood Park and Mount Tamalpais
and present them to the State of Cali
fornia for a public reserve."
Miss Eastwood's enthusiasm caught.
There was hand clapping that express
ed warmest accord in her sentiment.
WANT TREES FOR LUMBER.
| The primeval forest of redwoods In
' Marin County is to be preserved. The
towering trees are to be spared the ax
that has threatened them. /No lum
berman keen for profit shall invade
the jungle, no chips nor sawdust will
pollute the silvery stream that ripples
down the narrow canyon. One of the
most beautiful of California's wonder
lands is to be retrieved from the spec
ulator and maintained in all its na
tural grandeur.
The women of San Francisco have
so willed. They will preserve the
grove. They want to create a park
In the picturesque canyon that shall
particularly be for the edification of
the people of this city. Within two
hours' ride San Francisco has access
to this rugged, wild and beautiful bit
of scenery that equals some of na
ture's most favored spots that draw
"sightseers from afar.
The women of clubdom have made
up their minds to avert the destruc
tion of the forest. A meeting of rep
resentatives was held yesterday and
the enthusiasm and determination dls
plas'ed means that they will succeed-
True, $80,000. must be raised, and that
by popular subscription, to buy the
canyon. It may take time and much
eftort. but patience and energy will
not be wanting. With erery women's
organization in a solid phalanx, and
with further acquisitions of nower,
which will no doubt be forthcoming
without distinction of sex, the move
ment to save the grove is sure to suc
ceed. It commends itself so strongly
that public approbation will give it
impetus on every hand.

{ Davis Hubbard of San Francisco are
on thair way to Chamocix to revisit
tha spot where Habbard met hi3 bride.
VTtiiles ascending Al*uilleverte last
summer Hubbard Â«u hurt by falling
stones and carried to a hut. where he

SPOT WHERE LOVE BEGAN
STILL DEAR TO COUPLE
Mrs. Uarion Van Horn, who la be!nÂ«
sued fay Professor Rosa H. Van Hora
for a divorce on the grounds of Infideli
ty, wept on the witness stand to-day
while relating how on one occasion her
husband had taken a faniiy yroup pic
ture from an album and mutilated It
by scratching her lUcaness from the
photograph. She also dwelt in her tes
timony upon her husband's friendli
ness for Miss Josephine Brown, who
was a nurse at the Eye and Ear Hos
pital in San Francisco.
Mrs. Van Horn averred that her hus
band neglected to provide properly for
these dependent upon him. and In the
course of her narration Â»aid: "When
we were living at San Rafael he gavtr
us but S-0 a month to live on. He said
we could live on dried apples and wa
ter."
Counsel for the defense sprung a sur
prise by asaertin? that It would be
proved that Van Hora"s motive in en
deavoring to secrrre separation was to
obtain control of community property
in Seattle valued at C3.00a
Oakland O3ce San Francisco Call.

The first fcrJ tiled game of the sea
son was pulled off yesterday at Recre
ation Park, and the Seals were the of
fendersâalso the victims. After Kal
lackey had sent a hummer along the
third-base line in the seventh round the
Seals gathered around Umpire Chris
tie and besan to protest because he had
called the ball fair. He pulled a
vetch and gave them five minutes.
They were 'still disorderly, and the
tame was forfeited to Portland. The
score was 3 to 3 when the game
broke up.
The umpire might have been wrong,
but rtill Captain Charles Irwin should
have been possessed of better sense
than to stand with his teammates sur
rounding him sad argue a point when
the umpire held a watch on him. When
It was all over Irwin was mean and
low cnouph to deliberately throw a
broom at Christie while the latter was
talking off the field. ]f Christie knew
â¢xactly who did the trick he
would undoubtedly have done some
thing, but, not being sure, he let th2
matter pass.
This little act of indiscretion on the
part of Captain Irwin will cost Mr.
Hanis V.wQ. th>j fine imposed by the
league directors upon every manager or
captain who takes his team off the field
v.-hile a yame is in progress. Mr. Harris
was not present when the little side
play was made, but it is safe to say
he will not shower any compliments on
Mr. Irv.in when the pair meet again.
It is too bad the game came to such
an unsatisfactory wir.d-up, for both
teams wore playing- good ball and were
tjying hard to win. The honors were
about even, though the Brownies
seemed to have a trifle the best of the
argument, for they were hitting Bar
ber hartf and apparently were getting
ready to send a delegation of runs over
the plate. The small -crowd in attend
ance was- disgusted with the exhibi
tion.
With the score 3 to 2 in favor of the
Seals. Nadeau opened up the seventh
lor the Brownies with a bunt which he
beat to first. Then Kallackey took a
long swing at the ball and sent it
skimming alons thâ¬ first-base line. It
looked like a foul to some and a fair
ball to others. The umpire said "Fair,"
and Kallackey kf pt on running, bring
ing- Xadeau in and pulling up at third
himself.
Ths San Francisco team immediate
ly surrounded the umpire and tr*e usual
disgustms: scene of a gang of gabbling
tossers all talking at once ensued.
Christie tried to hold aloof from the
mo!>, and when they began to close in
upon him he borrowed a watch and an
nounced that he would call time upon
them. When a couple of minutes had
elapsed the fc^als went back to the
field. Irwin was ordered out of the
game, and came up to argue some
more. Christie then called the game
and declared Portland the winner â 9
to o. The score:

Delaney has had considerable experi
ence with athletes, both in the East
and in the West, and it is from his
close observation of their behavior that
his conclusions are deducted.
CHICAGO, Nov. 19.â Football play
ers, according to Jere Delaney, trainer
of the Northwestern University eleven,
are subject to an ailment similar to
softening of the brain, which leads not
only to the making of peculiar state
ments, but causes strange actions,
which sometimes are amusing.
The 'exact cause of the trouble,
Trainer Delaney says, he is unable to
fathom. He declares, however, that it
results more from the long-continued
physical and nervous, strain to which
the men are subjected during the three
months of rigid training which they
are forced to undergo than from the
blows, kicks and bumps they receive
on their skulls during the games.
Only at rare intervals during the
football season Is a candidate for a uni
versity team allowed any real recrea
tion.; His mind constantly is concen
trated on the theories and facts of the
game, which are pounded into him by
his coaches and trainers.

at 1 o'clock. This is tha greatest

The local theatrical managers have
relieved many of distress and have
stood the expense of burial of several
unfortunate actors during the last
twelve months. Their funds have thus
been depleted to a considerable ex
tent. The public^ always quick and
ready to respond to this really worthy
cause, however, and the bis theater
will undoubtedly be packed to tha
doors. The performance Is always
worth more than the price of admis

the theater box offices.

Captain McPherson jumped over
board to save Dr. Taylor, but was too
late.
Included in the sailing party were
a number of well-known San Diego
people and members of Dr. Taylor's

Taylor came .here from Iowa several
years ago.
SAN DIEGO. Nov. 19.â Rev. Dr. R.
B. Taylor, pastor of the First Presby
terian Church, was drowned in the
bay this afternoon shortly after 3
o'clock. Dr. Taylor was a member
of a sailing party of about twenty per
sons on board Captain McPherson's
yacht. While near the marine ways,
oil North Island, he was walking along
the edge of the boat when he slipped
overboard into the water. The tide
was going out like a millrace and be
fore any of the members of the party
could render assistance he was
drowned.
In a long one-set match George

won by a 6-4 score.

Probably the best doubles of the
day was a^four-set tie between Frank
Stringham and Sidney Salisbury and
S. H. Adams ad Orville Pratt. Each
side had won two 6-4 sets when they
\jere compelled to give up the court
to other players. It was a fast match
from start to finish and an interesting
one for the spectators to watch.
Harold Gabriel and Melville Long,
two promising young players, figured
in a five-set match, in which Gabriel
carried off the honors.
Dr. Phillip and Dr. Younger, two
veteran players, proved they can still
Â¦put -up a fast game. They won both
their matches, beating such cracks as
Long and Janes in one match and W.
MacGavin and Kenyon in the other.
The medical experts play as fast a
game as any youngsters on the courts
and can make a good showing against
any of the cracks in either singles or
doubles.
Herbert Long and George Janes
played two fast sets with Ray Cornell
and Harry Rolfe. The former won
both eets?, but they were exceedingly
close. The losers did some excellent
lobbing. Â«
Duval Moore and Grant Smith
proved a trifle too strong for Arthur
Chesebrough and Paul Jones. Moore
and Smith won the first three sets
handily and their opponents annexed
the fourth.
Players were so numerous at the
California Tennis \ Club yesterday
afternoon that ground rules had to be
enforced. In many cases the number
of sets were limited and the players
were compelled to double up on every
court. Many of the old-timers are
back in the game and are fast regain

Max Weinstock, a soldier, had his
left foot crushed yesterday in a collis
sion between a Kearny and a Union
street car at the corner of Montgomery
avenue and Kearny street.
Mrs. Casterline heard of the accident,
but did not know the victim was her
mother until she returned home'.
Boya Gluhama, an Italian living at
fi>5% Broadway, was struck by a Kear
ny street last night as he attempt
ed to run in front" of it at Broadway.
Gluhama was thrown several feet and
picked up in an unconscious condition.
He was taken to the Harbor Hospital,
where it was found that his skull was
fractured, his left arm broken and his
body badly bruised. His Injuries^ will
probably prove fatal. Gluhama was
employed in the Commercial restau

Mrs. Sarah Carter, a woman 60 years
of age, living at 672 Harrison street,
was ground to death' Deneath the
wheels of a Folsom street car shortly
before 6 o'clock last evening. The aged
woman was frightfully mangled and it
became necessary for employes of the
company to raise the front truck of
the car to extricate the body. The re
mains, were taken to the Morgue and
G. G. Barkdow, the motorman, was
charged with manslaughter at the
Central station.
Mrs. Carter attended a matinee dur
ing the afternoon, after which she went
to meet her daughter, Mrs. E. Caster
line, at a friend's house at 652 Folsom
street. While Mrs. Casterline was talk
ing to her friend Mrs. Carter started
to walk home, crossing Folsom street In
the direction of Hawthorne street.
Apparently she did not see a west
bound- Folsom street car approaching,
for she did not hesitate at the side of
the track when the motorman clanged
his bell. In an instant the heavy car
was upon her, though the man in
charge of the car attempted to stop.
When the terrified passengers who had
witnessed the accident leaped to the
ground they found the woman's life
extinct. Her skull was fractured
and her lower limbs crushed. The em
ployes of the company then raised the
front trucks erf the car and took the
body out. The motorman says he is
blameless in the matter, as he did
everything in his power -to save the
woman's life.
CHICAGO, Nov. 19.â Shot dead In an
automobile by bank robbers, whose
plot the victim of the tragedy had dis
covered and whose plans he had frus
trated, is one explanation of the
mysterious death of William Bate, a
chauffeur, whose corpse and machine
were found on a lonely roadside to
day. The theory was advanced by
Bate's employer after an investigation
of the. circumstances. The idea is that
the men who hired the automobile were
bank robbers and contemplated a raid
on some bank in some small town.
Investigation at the Auditorium Ho
tel to-day developed the fact that a
man giving the name of "Dobbs"had
appeared at the hotel last evening and
had asked Edward Slavin, the hotel
telephone operator, to have Daniel Ca
nary send an automobile to the Audi
torium at once w
That Bate did not commit suicide,
but was shot down by an assassin, is
indicated by the finding of an empty
cartridge. Bhell to-day in the tonneau
of the automobile.
At the Canary Company's office it
was said that when the call was re
ceived last night a machine for two
was asked for.
William Bate, the dead chauffeur,
had been connected with the" Canary
Company for several years and was
well known as a fast driver.
The circumstances- surrounding the
death of Bate were made more puzzling
to-night by the report that a woman
was in the automobile a short time
before Bate is believed to have been
killed.
John S. Eiler, a farmer, gave this
information to the police late to-night.
He said that he was aroused about 11
o'clock by loud , knocking at the door
of his house and when he demanded to
know who was there a man replied:
"Will you let me in if I go to the
rear door? I must get in for I am in
â¢danger."
Eiler offered to open the door if the
man would give his name, but he re
fused to give it and Kiler, thinking It
was a plan to rob him, did not open the
door. The man returned to the auto
mobile, where Eiler says he heard
voices in a vehement dispute, among
them that of a woman.

Hildebrand accepted the mount on
Stroller and received a rousing recep
tion from the crowd. It didii't look
as if Wally Brinkworth's mudlark had
a rosy chance, for the track, while
slow, was in fairly good condition.
Still the presence "of "Hildy" In the

Football Men Strangely Affected.
Yale got her first touchdown by con
sistent rushing in the first half. The
second came throueh a blocked k!c'<c
in the second half. Harvard's most
successful attack was a cross-buck.
which several times opened- holes la
Yale's line through which, singularly
enough, the backs could make no pro*
nounced gains.
When the rame was over the YalÂ»
men beran a celebration of their vic

the eam9 was roush. In every posi
tion Yale had the advantage. Her
linemen outplayed the men against
them. Hoyt outclassed Sperry and
Nichols In punting was a worthy wc
cessor to MitchelL On Harvard's side.
Brill showed up best, although Mat
thewg, who replaced Randall. di<2
finely.
YALE'S FIRST TOUCHDOWN*.
The same as a whole was somewhat
tedious. It vras almost devoid of sen
sational plays, and its one brilliant In
cident was the blocking of Sperry's
punt in the second half, which brought
Yale's second touchdown. Even this
was better appreciated by football men
than by the spectators.
The crowd was probably the largest
that has ever seen a football game in
this country. The weather was that
of an Indian summer day. No such
throng ever Invaded this city. The
means of transportation to and from
the city, ample as it was thought to be,
was notably inadequate.
Amonp the distinguished spectators
were Vice President-elect Fairbanks
and Mrs. Fairbanks, J. P. Morgan and
August Belmont. Miss Alice Roosevelt,
with a party of girl friends, sat in the
Harvard section.
Despite all precautions the game was
a little delayed at the start, and so
slowly did it progress that dusk -was
falling when the end came.
Yale played faster than Harvard,
and went from beginning to end with
out a change in the line-up. Harvard
played many substitutes In places of
men vrho were used up. but luckily no
players were seriously hurt. At times
NEW HAVEN. Conn.. Nov. 19.â Tale
earned a victory which was In every
way satisfactory to her friends over
her old time rival. Harvard. In the
presence of more than 32.000 spectators
on Yale field this afternoon. The final
score was 12 to 0. the same as that in
her victory over Princetc-n a week ago.
The game was one in which the men
in blue proved the superiors of a
brawnier set of opponents, both in the
art of offense and defense, in the first
place through better team work with
a few simple formations, and in the
second . stance through her ability to
stop or break any play, whether of a
plunge character or used as a subter
fuge to turn her flanks. Yale was not
called upon to use a formation which
had nyt been shown in her games of
the entire season and at no time was
there any doubt of the outcomje.
Harvard placed some reliance on
plays which were Intended to gain
ground by runs around the end. In
nearly every instance these failed. The
precision with which Yale moved her
plays all the time and the united action
of her backs with the linemen, stamped
Captain Hc-gan's team as one of the
most remarkable which ever went on a
field to uphold the glory cf the blue.
To Harvard, however, which sent a
team of unknown quality, must be
given the credit of playing a wonder
ful, game cm the defense and of show
ing at times In the second half flashes
of inherent brilliancy on the offensive.

to settle the supremacy of college
j classes and also to decide who will

j made a brilliant showing in the mile

crack who was thought to have the
event a'- his mercv.
Symmes did some excellent pole

A great running sore, or deep offensive ulcer may develop from a slight scratch, bruise or pimples â a harm-

chronic ulcers, but the young, even children, who have inherited weak constitutions or had them contaminated
and tainted by Malaria, or other sickness, are afflicted in the same way. These chronic sores and ulcers are a
constant drain on the system, sapping the vitality and strength- They depress the energy with their foul pollu-

is unable to throw off. Salves, washes, powders, etc., can never be of any permanent service in the treatmentof

The Ban Francisco Ladles' Protective j
and Relief Society celebrated its fiftieth j
anniversary yesterday at Its home,
corner G*ary and Franklin streets.
The halls and assembly room were
festively decorated; greens ln abun- j
dance wound about chandeliers and i
pillars, while flowers and potted plants j
Cjdorned tables and window ledges.
The history of this society Is of in
terest to all philathropiets and pioneers, j
for Its origin dates with the coming of j
the California gold-*eekers. Of this j
history. Mrs. S. W. Dennis, president of j
the society, grave a comprehensive ,
sketch.
Organized ln 1S53 by Mrs. Eaton, wife
of Major Eaton, for the protection and
relief of helpless women, many of
whom, born in luxury, knew nothing of j
â¢work â the first home was established
at Second and Tehama streets. At j
first a wagon was driven to the lead- ,
Ing merchants, from whom were obtain- i
ed provisions cf all kinds, and soon the '
noclety was on a basis of success that
necessitated its removal to larger
Quarters.
An appeal to the Legislature gained |
it an appropriation of $3000. and from
the total amount of funds then a home
was built, still on Tehama street.
The flourishing condition continued. ;
many prominent people lending gener
ous aid, until 1863. when H. H. Hawes
furthered the cause to a greater extent
by donating the building and site where
the society thrives to-day.
Mrs. Dennis' address was followed by :
remarks from Rev. Dr. Wllley, one of ,
the early workers.
Choruses by children of the homo I
were well Bung. There Is no Illness at
the present time among the children,
of whom there are 240. Sanitary regu- |
latlons and conditions are stringently
watched.
The trip to be so full of pleasure, j
planned by Mr. and Mrs. James Follls, !
has been abruptly checked by the sud- ,
den Illness of Mr. Follls. They left j
eomt weeks ago ln company with Mr. I
nnd Mrc Latham McMullln for a lefs- j
tirely visit of the Exposition, to be fol- j
lowed by extended Eastern sightseeing. !
The illness of Mr. Follis has caused ,
h'.s return home, where he and Mrs.
Follls arrived a few days ago.
Dr. and Mrs. Edward Grigsby have ;
been overwhelmed with visitors Bince j
their arrival from Nome a few days .
eince. The trip to that country, being
one for exploration and research, as j
trell as pleasure, ha* been one of sue- j
cess ln both lines. Both Dr. and Mrs. I
Grigsby have entertaining news of their J
Journey, replete with much that es- j
capes the ordinary traveler.
Prince*s Mahomet Ibrahim, during
her visit in New York, will be enter
tained by Mrs. Hermann Oelricha. TljÂ«
Princess ie the daughter of Ishmael
Pasha of Turkey.
The literary Inclination of Mrs.
Clarence Mackay is actively employed
most of the time. She Is preparing an
other novel, but as to its character or
title nothing Is known.
Bin Francisco's memory Is kÂ«pt green
by a tiny but active colony ln the north.
The Vancouver Barracks has claimed
four of our fair maids during: the past
two years, and though their surround
ings are congenial and pleasant, each
arrival from the home city is met with
open arms. We are the losers, but can
ecarcely begrudge the welcome that la
extended from the northern settlement.
Jfow, Mrs. Frederick Kellond (Kathe
rlne SeLfridge) Is the last to join that
jnllit&rr reservation, where she was met
by Mrs. Andrew Rowan (Mrs. de
CJreayer), Mrs. Gilbert Allen (Ethel
Kent) and Mrs. Malcolm Graham
(Mamie Kent)â a happy quartet; be
sides the other army womrti there are
most hospitable and warm-hearted.
Judge Irving Dudley, Mfhlster to
Peru, gave Just a passing glimpse of
himself this week, going on to San
Jose and vicinity to visit with many
old friends.
