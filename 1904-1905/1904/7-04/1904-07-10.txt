ferred to be farther from the station
with that girl's red coat before I got
out. "We've missed our train, anyway,
haven't we? After this, daddy dear,
let's not take this route. If we'd go
straight through on the one road, we
wouldn't have this drive across town
every time. I was wondering, before
I fell asleep, what in the world I'd do
In this big city if you didn't come."
He forgot to withdraw his arm, so
occupied was he by my predicament.
"What would you do, my child. If you
hadâ had missed yourâ your father?"
Wasn't it clumsy of him? 'He wanted
to break it to me gently, and this was
the best he could do.

alone,. and â and without money! Why
â why, how can youâ"

The horses had started, and the car

He was a little Bishop, not big and
fat and well-kept like the rig, but
short and lean, with a little white
beard and the softest eyeâ and the soft

"Lord bless me!" he exclaimed, hur
riedly putting on his spectacles, and
looking about bewildered.
I was slumbering sweetly in the cor-'

that he thought he'd jumped into
somebody else's carriage. ;;:C
The sight of his book and his papers
comforted him, though, and before he
could make a resolution, I let the

âwell, Tom drew off the crowd, having
passed the old gentleman's watch to
me. and I made for the women's rooms.
The station was crowded as it al

had the. cloak all right, but It was a

And what dldjl.do nowt
I stayed and looked a second too long,
for just as I wag pulling the flaring
hat a bit over my face the doors
swung: as an - old lady came in, and
there behind: her was that eame curi
ous man's face with the cap above it.
Trapped? Me? Not much! I didn't
wait a minute, â¢ but threw the ' doors
open -with . a I gesture, that- might ' have
belonged to the Queen of Spain. I
almost ran into his arms.. He j?ave,an
exclamation. I looked aiin straight In
tiie eyes; as I hooked the collar close to

He "weakened.' That coat "was too

too. Ab I ran down the stairs Its in
fluence so worked on, me s that I didn't
know Just which Vanderbilt I was. !
I got out on the sidewalk all right,
and was just about to take a car. when
the turnstile swung round, and there
was that same man with the cap. His
face was a funny mixture of doubt and
determination. But it meant the Cor
rection for me.
"Nance Olden, it's over," I said to
myself.
But it wasn't. For it was then that
I caught sight of the carriage. It was
a fat, low, comfortable, elegant, sober
carriage, wide and well-kept, with
rubber-tired wheels. And the two
heavy horses were fat and elegant and
sober, too, and wide and well-kept. I
didn't know it was the Bishop's then â
I didn't care whose it was. It was
empty, and it was mine. I'd rather go
to the Correctionâ being too young to
get to the place you're bound for, Tom

had.'

ask Tom what he thinks of my style
when I'm on parade. At any rate, it
was the maid's fault. She took down
the coat and hat and held them for me
as though they were mine. What
could I do *cept just slip into the silk-
Hned beaut}', and set the toque on my
head? The fooj girl that owned them
was having: another maid mend a tear
in her skirt, over in the corner; the lit
tle place was crowded. Anyway, I had
both the coat and hat on and was out
into the big anteroom in a jiffy. - A
What nearly wrecked me was the cut
of that coat. It positively made me
shiver with pleasure when I passed
and saw myself in that long mirror.
My. but I was great! The hang of that
coat, the long, incurving sweep in the
bact. and the high fur collar up to
one's nose â even if it is a turned-up
nose â oh!

idea, and left the room only to come
back again to whisper to me:; :

"What name? what name?" I re

"No, nobody "could be out therf,"
she said, breathing hard, "but you

it . Just practice, you know, Tom. A
.girl can never know when she'll want

She made me lie down, on a couch
while she turned the lamp low, and
then left me alone in a big palace of
a bedroom filled with things. And I
wanted everything I saw. If I could,'
I'd have lifted everything in sight
But every minute brought that doc

sure she was gone, I got up, and, hur
rying to the long French windows that
opened on the great stone piazza, I un
fastened them quietly, and inch by
inch I pushed them open.
There within ten feet of me stood
Edward. No escape that way. He saw
me and was tiptoeing heavily toward
me, when I heard the door click be
hind me, and In walked the Dowager
back again. . . ,
I flew to her.
"I thought I heard some one out
there," I said. "It frightened me so
that I got up to look. Nobody could be
out there, could they?"
She walked to the window and put
her head out. Her lips tightened
grimly.

ward with my sad story.

No, my dear Miss Murieson, if this
lady's your mother, why, I must be â at
least, i* ought to be, your father. As
such, I'm going to have all the priv
ileges of a parentâ bless me, if I'm
not" - - i
I don't suppose he'd have done it if
he'd been sober, but there's no telling
when you remember the reputation the
Dowager had given him. But he'd got
no further than to put his arm around
me when both the Bishop and the
Dowager flew to the rescue. My, but
they were shocked! I couldn't help
wondering what they'd have done if
Edward had happened to see the
Bishop In the same sort of tableau
earlier In the afternoon.
But I got a lucid interval just then,
; and distracted their /attention. I stood
for a moment, my. head bent as though'
T_ was thinking deeply.
"I think I'll go now," i said at length.
"Iâ I don't understand exactly how. I
got here," I went on, looking from the
Bishop to the Dowager and back
again, "or how I happened to miss my
father. I'm ever &6 much obliged to
you and if you will give me my hat
I'll take the next train back "to col
lege." â¢ j
"You'll do nothing of the sort," said
the Dowager, promptly. "My dear,
you're a sweet girl 'that's been studying
too hard. You must 'go to Â¦ my room
and rest â " ! 
\ "And stay for dinner. Don't you
"Evening, Bishop. Hello, Henrietta,
back so soon from the opera?" roared
Edward, in a big, husky voice. He'd
had more since we saw him, but he
I Just looked big-eyed up at him.
You know; the way Molly's kid does
when he wakes. I looked a long, long
time, as though I was puzzled.
â¢ "Daddy," I said slowly, sitting up.
"You â you are my daddy, ain't you?"
"Yes â yes, of course." It was the
Dowager who got betw r een him and me,
hinting heavily at" him with nods and
frowns. But the dear old fellow only
got pinker in the effort to look a He
and not say it. Still, he looked re
lieved. Evidently he thought I was
luny all right, but that I had lucid in
tervals. I heard him whisper some
thing like this to the, Dowager just be
fore the maid came in with tea for me.
Yes, Tom Dorgan, tea for Nancy
Olden off a silver salver, out of a cup
like a painted eggshell. My, but that
almost floored me! I was afraid I'd
give myself dead away with all those
little Jars and jugs. So I said I wasn't
hungry, though. Lord knows. I hadn't
had anything to eat since early morn
ing. But the Dowager sent the maid
away and took the tray herself, opera
ting all the jugs and pots for me, and
then tried to feed me the tea. She was
about as handy as Molly's little sister
Is with" the baby â but I allowed myself
to be coaxed and drank It down.
Tea, Tom Dorgan. Ever taste tea?
If you knew how to behave yourself in
polite society. I'd give you a card to
my friend the Dowager up . in the
square. ?Â¦}' .'
How to get away! That was the
thing that worried me. I'd Just made
up my mind to have a lucid interval,
when cr-creak, the front door opened,
and In walked â
- Tom, you're mighty cute â so cute
you'll land us both behind bars some
day â but you can't guess who came In

yes, you've met him. Â¦Â¦'. -.-â¢-Â¦' :
Well, the old duffer whose watch was
ticking inside my waist that very min

necked fellow we'd spied getting full
at the little station in the .country.
Only he was a little mellower than
when you grabbed his chain. Well, he
was Edward, v .V.
I almost dropped the cup when I saw
him. The Dowager took it from me,
saying:

Where not? I looked under the rub

his Job, but that very youth and inno

"Nat," says Mrs. Kingdom, tearfully
pressing half a dollar into the nice
lad's hand, "Iâ I've lost something and
I want you toâ to help me find it"
"Yes'm," says Nat. He's the soul of
politeness.
"It must be hereâ it must be in this
room," says the lady, getting wild
with the terror of losing. "I'm sure â
positiveâ that I went straight to the
shoe-bag and slipped It in there. And
now I can't, find It, and I must have It
before I go^ out this afternoon forâ for

Evelyn will be home to-morrow andâ
why don't you look for it?"
"What is it, ma'am?"
"I told you once. My keyâ a little
flat key that locksâ a box I've got,"
she finished distrustfully.
"Have you looked in the shoe-bag,
ma'am?"
Now, Nat, in blue and buttons, with
his nails kept better than most boys,
with his curly hair parted In the mid
dle, and with a gentle twang to his
voice that makes him almost girlish â
who would suspect Nat of having a
stolen pass-key in his pocket and a
pretty fair knowledge of the contents
of almost every top bureau-drawer in

But her vanityâ ah, there's where we
get her, such speculators as you and

so she borrows her diamonds from the

"Come, dear, let me help you off with
your coat," she cooed, bending over
me.
"Oh, mummy, It's so cold! Can't I

To let that coat off me was to give
the whole thing away. My rig under

"Oh, mummy," 1 went on quickly.

tell you, Tom, when it comes to lying

something stronger than it takes to

I didn't /wait for hi:n to finish, but
â¢waltzed right in. I danced straight up
to that side of beef with the diamonds
Etill on it. and Hinging my arms about
her, turned a coy eye on the Bishop.
"You said your wifo was cut of town,
daddy," I cried jrayly. "Have you got
another wife besides mummy?"
The poor Bishop! Do you think he
tumbled? Sfpt a bitâ not a bit. He sat
there gasping like a fish, and Mrs.
Dowager Diamonds, surprised by my
sudden attack, stood oo!t upright,
about as pleasant to hug asâ as you
ere, Tom. trijea you're jealous.
Oh^the baby! the baby! She was

"My dear Mrs. Ramsay," he began,
confused a bit by his remembrance of
how her face had looked fifteen min
utes before. "I bring to you an unfor
tunate child, who mistook my carriage
for her father's this afternoon at the
station. She is a college girl, a
stranger in town, and till her father
claims her â "
That'll do, Tom.
Girls, if you could have seen Mrs.
Dowager Diamonds' face when she
came down the stairs, the Bishop's
card in her hand, end into the gor
geous parlor, it'd have been as good as
a front seat at the show.
She was mad and she was curious,
end she was amazed, and she was dis
p.rmed: for the very nerve of his bring
ing me to her staggered her so that
she could hardly believe she'd seen
ivhat she had.
He thought it was his scheme, the
poor lamb, to put me In her charge till
my lost daddy could send for me. He'd
no more Idea that I was steering him
toward her. that he was doing the only
thing possible, the only square thing
by his reputation, than he had that
Nance Olden had been raised by the
Cruelty, and then flung: herself away
on the first handsome Irish boy she
inet.
My, but it was a rotten bad move!
I ought to have been strapped for it.
Oh, Tom, Tom. !t takes more'n a red
coat with chinchilla to make a black
hearted thing: like me into the girl he
though I was.
He stiffened ar.d sat up like a prim
little school -boy, his eoft eyes hurt
like a dog's that's been wounded.
I won't tell you what I did then. No,
I won't And you won't understand,
but Just that minute I cared more for
Â¦what he thought of me than whether I
got to the Correction or anywhere else.
It made us friends in a minute, and
when he stopped the carriage to let me
out, my hand was still in his. But I
wouldn't go. I'd made up my mind to
see him out of his part of the scrape,
and first thins; you know we were
driving up toward the square, if you
please, to Mrs. Dowager Diamonds'
house.
"Oh, because of her." I said, smiling
and pointing: to the side where the
coupe had been.
The dignity and tenderness and cour
tesy in his voice sort of sobered me.
But all at once I remembered the face
of Mrs. Dowager Diamonds, and I un
derstood.
"Why, certainly, child. But I'm old
enough surely to be, and I wishâ I wish
â I wish I were."
"You do!"
and htre In the middle of all these car
riages was a bully good time and place
for ma to get away. I turned to the
Bishop. He was blushing like a boy. . I
Hushed, too. Yes, I did, Tom Dorgan,
but It was because I was bursting with
laughter.
"Oh, dear!" I exclaimed in .sudden
dismay. "You're not my father.** Â¦
"Noâ no, my dear, I â Fm not," he
Btarnmered, his face purple now with
embarrassment. "I was Just trying to
tell you, you poor little girl, of your
mistake and planning a way to help
you, when â "
He made a gesture of despair toward
the Eide where the coupe had-been.
I covered my face with my hands,
and shrinking over into the corner, I
cried: â¢
"Let me out! let me out! You're not
my father. Oh, let me out!"
Phew! She wasn't very promising,
but she was my only chance. I took
her.
"I really don't need 'any help, thank
you, Nora," I said, chipper as a spar
row, and remembering the name the
Dowager had called her by. "Aunt
Henrietta is too fussy, don't you think?
Oh, of course," you won't say a word
against her. She told me the other
day that she'd never had a maid so
sensible and quick-witted, too, as
Nora. Do you know, I've a mind to
play a Joke on the doctor when he
comes. You'll help me, won't you?
Oh, I know you will!" * Suddenly I re
membered the Bishop's bill. I took it
out of my pocket Yep, Tom. that's
where It went. I had to choose between
giving that skinny maid the biggest
tip she ever got In her lifeâ or Nance
Olden to the Correction.
You needn't swear, Tom Dorgan. I
fancy If I'd got there, you'd got worse.
No, you bully, you know I wouldn't
tell; but the police sort of know how
to pair our kind.
In her cap and apron I let the doctor
in and myself out And I don't regret
a thing up there In the square except
that lovely red coat with the high col
lar and the hat with the fur on it. I'd
give â Tom, get me a coat like that and
I'll marry you for life.
No, there's one thing I could do bet
ter If it was to be done over again. I
could make that dear little old Bishop
wish harder I'd been his daughter.
What am I mooning about? Oh â
nothing. There's the watch â Edward's
watch. â¢ Take It.
I began to think about the Correction
again as I followed her upstairs, and
after she'd left me I just sat waiting
for the doctor to come and send me
there. I didn't care much, till I re
membered the Bishop. I could almost
see . his face as it would look when
he'd be called to ; testify against me.
and I'd be standing in that ralled-in
prisoner's pen, in the middle of the
courtroom. . where Dan Chrlstensen
stood' when they tried him.
No, I couldn't bear that; not without
a fight, anyway. It was for the
Bishop I'd got Into this part of the
scrape. I'd get out of it so's he
shouldn't know how bad a girl can be.
While I lay thinking it over, the
same maid that had brought me the
tea cairie in. She was an ugly, thin
little 'thing. If she's a sample of the
maids In that house, the lot of them
would take the kink out of your
pretty hair, Thomas J. Dorgan, Es
quire, late of the House of Refuge and
soon of Moyamenslng. Don't throw
things. People in my set, mine and the
Dowager's, don't.
She had been sent to help me un
dress, she said, and make me com
fortable. The doctor lived Just around
the corner and would be in in a min
ute.
"Why, Missâ Miss Murieson. Til see
you back all the way to the college
door. Not at all, not at alL Charmed.
First, well have dinnerâ or, first ril
care. Sometimes I don't know how I
get here ' myself." Edward winked
Jovially. â¢'â¢ Â¦- ..-Â¦â¢-.Â¦
Â¦Well, I did. While the Dowager's
back was turned, I * gave - him the lit
tlest \ one ' in / return for his. It made
him drunker* than ever.
"I think," said the Bishop, grimly,
with a significant 'glance at the Dow
ager, as he 'turned Just then and fsaw
the old cock/ ogling me, ' "the young
lady is wiser than we. I'll take her to
the stationâ" '
.The station! "Ugh! Not Nance Olden
with i the: red coat still on. Â¦
"Impossible, my dear Bishop," in
terrupted the Dowager. "She can't be
permitted to' go back on the train
alone." ,
The Dowager and I passed Edward
In the halL He gave me a. look behind
"My child," he said, taking my hand.

hurried him.
> "Thereâ there.- It's only a Joke. Isn't
it a Joke, Edward?" she demanded^
laughing uneasily. .
"Joke?" he repeated with a hearty
bellow 'of laughter. "Best kind of .a
joke, I call It, to find so pretty a girl
right in your own house, eh, Bishop?"
"Why does he call my father
"Bishop/ mummy?"
I couldn't help it. The fun of hearing
the . Dowager He and knowing the
Bishop beside, himself with the pain of
deception was too much for me. Z
walked straight as the Bishop himself,
and he's a dear little ramrod. "Ah!"
â his eyes â¢ lit up ; at sight \ of meâ "ah,

lady, Henrietta, but hang me if I
haven't forgotten her name."

lady, glibly. "A^â a relative. "
"Why, mummy!" I' said reproach
fully... '...... . :""-- â¢Â¦' Â¦ Â¦ 'Â¦ ;Â¦ \.
I should say good by to the nerve I'd
had since I got Into the Bishop's car
riage â and from there Into society. I
let her take the hat, though, and I
could see by the way she handled It
that it was all rightâ the thing; her
kind, you know. Oh, the girl I got It
from had good taste, all right.
I closed my eyes for a moment as I
lay there . and she stood stroking my
hair. She must have thought I'd fallen
asleep, for he turned to the Bishop
and holding out her hand she said
softly:
"My dear, dear Bishop," you are the
best-hearted, the saintliest man on
earth. Because you are so beautifully
clean-souled yourself, you must par
don me. I am ashamed to say it, but
I shall have no rest till I do. When I
saw you In the carriage downtown,
with that poor demented child, I
thought, for Just a moment â oh, can
you forgive me? It shows what an
evil mind I have. But you, who know
so well what Edward Is, what my life
has been with him. will see how much
reason I have to be suspicious of all
men!"
I shook, I laughed so hard. What
a corker her Edward must be! See,
Tom, poor old Mrs. Dowager up in
the square having the same devil's
luck with her man as Molly Elliott
down in the alley has with hers. I
wonder if you're all alike. No, for
there's the Bishop. He had taken her
hand sympathizingly, forgivingly, but
his silence made me curious. I knew he
wouldn't let the old lady believe for a
moment I was luny, if once he could be
sure himself that I wasn't. You He,
Tom Dorgan. he wouldn't! Well â But
the poor baby, how could he expect to
Bee through a game that had caught
the Dowager herself? Still, I could
hear him walking softly toward me.
and I felt him looking keenly down at
me long before I opened my eyes.
When I did, you should have seen
him Jump. Guilty he felt. I could see
That time he caught the Major's ear
âthe one that wasn't deaf. He looked
from Powers' black face to the bench
and then to me. And all the time the
bell kept ringing like mad.
"Git!" he said to the boy. "And
come back in a hurry."
Number Twenty-one gotâ but leis
urely. It wouldn't do for a bellboy to
hurry, particularly when he had such
good cause.
Oh, girls, those stone stairs. the
servants' stairs at the St. James!
They're fierce. I tell you. Mag. scrub

bad. But this time I was Jolly glad
bellboys weren't allowed in the eleva
tor. For there were those diamonds
In my pants pocket, and I must get rid
of 'em before I got Cown to the office
again. So I climbed those stairs, and
every step I took my eye was search
ing for a hiding-place. I could have
pitched the little bag out of a win
dow, but Nancy Olden wasn't throw

One flight
No chance.
Another.
Everything bare as stone and soap
could keep it.
The third flightâ my knees began to
tremble, and not with climbing. The
call came from this floor. But I ran
up a fourth just on the chance, and
there In a corner was a flre hatchet
strapped to the wall. Behind that
hatchet Mrs. Kingdon's diamonds
might lie snug till evening. I put the
ends of my fingers first in the little
crack to make sure the little bag
wouldn't drop to the floor, and then
dived into my pocket and â
And there behind me. stealthily com
ing up the last turn of the stairs was
Mr. George Mori way!
Don't you hate a soft-walking man.
MagZ That cute fellow was cutec
But Number Twenty-one didn't
budge. His heart was beating like a
hammer, and the ting-ng-ng of that
bell calling him rang In his head like
a song.
"Number Twenty-one!" yelled the
clerk.
Oh, he's got a devil of a temper, has
that clerk. Some day, Tom. when you
love me very much, go up to the hotel

"You! â boy â confound you, cant you
hear?" he shouted.
"I knew It was there. I told you It
was there. If you'd had any sense
you'd looked there first. The boys in
this hotel are so stupid."
"That's all, ma'am?"
She nodded. She was flttln* the key

"Natâ Natâ come back! My dla

Nat could have told herâ btrt what's
the use? He felt she'd only lose **m

lie snug in his trousers pocketâ where
he had put the chamois bag when his
eyes lit on it under the corner of the
carpet. He might have passed it over
to her then, but you see. Tom. she
hadn't told him to look for a bag; It
was a key she wanted. Bellboys are
so stupid.
This time she followed his every
step. He could not put his hand on
the smallest thins without rousing her
suspicion. If he hesitated, she scolded.
If he hurried, she fumed. Most unjust.

stealingâ just then.
"Come," she said at last, "we'll go
down and report It at the desk."
"Hadn't I better wait here, ma'am.
and look again?**
She looked sharply at him.
"No; you'd better do- as I tell you.**
So down we went. And we met Mr.
Morlway there. She'd telephoned him.
The chambermaid was called, the
housekeeper, the electrical engineer
who'd been fixing bells that morning,
and, as I said, a bellboy named Nat,
who told how he'd Just come on duty
when Mrs. Kingdom's bell rang, found
her key and returned it to her. and was
out of the room when she unlocked the
box. That was all he knew.
"Is he telling the truth?" Morlway
asked Mrs. Kingdon.
"Ye-es, I guess he is; but where are
the diamonds? We must have themâ
you know â to-day, George." she whis
pered. And then she turned and went
upstairs, leaving Morlway to do the
rest.
"There's only one thing to do, Major,"
he said to the proprietor. "Search 'em
all and then â "
"Search me? It's an outrage!" cried
the housekeeper. â¢ \
"Search me If ye lolke." growled Mc-
Carthy, resentfully. "Oi wasn't there
but a minute; the lady herself can tell
ye that."
Katie, the chambermaid, flushed
painfully, and there were Indignant
tears In her eyes, which, 1*11 tell you in
confidence, made a girl named Nancy
uncomfortable.
But the boy Nat, knowing that bell
boys have no rights, said nothing. But
he thought. He thought. Tom Dorgan.

The peppery old Major marched us
all off to his private office.
Not much, girls. It hadn't come. For
suddenly the annunciator rang out.
Out of the corner of his eye. Nat
looked at the bellboys' bench.- It was
empty. There was to be a ball that
night, and the bells were going It over
all the place.
"Number Twenty-one!"- shouted the
clerk at the desk.

lyn's boot and In her ribbon box. I
emptied Mrs. Kingdom's full powder
box. I climbed ladders and felt along
cornices. I looked through the pockets
of Mrs. Kingdom's gownsâ a clever
bellboy It takes to find a j woman s
pocket, but even the real masculine
ones among 'em are half feminine;
they've had so much to do with
women.
,1 rummaged through her writing
desk, and, In searching a gold-cornered
pad, found a note from Morlway hid
den tinder the corner. I bid It again
carefullyâ In my coat pocket- A love
letter from Morlway, to a woman
twenty years older than himselfâ
â¢taln't a bad lay, Tom Dorgan. but you
needn't try it.
At first 6he watched every move I
made, but later, as her headache grew
worse, she got desperate. So then I
put my hand down Into the shoe-bag
and found the key. where It had slipped
under a fold of cloth.
Do you suppose that woman was
grateful? She snatched It from me.
THE SAN FRANCISCO SUNDAY CALC.
I put my hand to my head.

"That's right," assented the Bishop.
"I'll go get him myself."
"Youâ you're not going!" I cried in
dismay. It was real. I hated to see

"Nonsenseâ 'phone." It was Edward
who went himsetf to telephone for the

And the goods still on me, Tom,
mind that.
My, but Mrs. Kingdon was wraths
when she saw me!
"Why did they send you?" she cried.
***Why did you keep me waiting sc

Is crazy about that old ball to-night,

"Can't I do- what you want, ma'am?"
I Just yearned to get Inside that door.
"No," she snapped. "I don't want a
boy to fasten my dress in the backâ"
"We often do. ma'am," I said softly.
"You do? Wellâ"
"Yes'm." I breathed again.
"Wellâ it's indecent. Go down and
send me a maid."
She was Just closing the door in my
face â and Moriway waiting for me to
watch me down again.
"Mrs. Kingdon â "
"Well, what do you want?"
"I want to tell you that when I get
down to the office they'll search me."
She looked at me amazed.
"Andâ and there's something In my
pocket Iâ you wouldn't like them to
find."
"What in the worldâ my diamonds!
Tou did take them, you little wretch?"
She caught hold of my coat. But
Lordy! I didn't want to get away a
little bit. I let her pull me In, and
then I backed up against the door
and shut it.
"Diamonds! Oh, no, ma'am. I hope
I'm not a thief. Butâ but it was some
thing you dropped â this."
I fished Moriway's letter out of my
pocket and handed it to her.
The poor old lady! Being a bellboy
you know Just how old ladies really
are. This one at evening, after her
face had been massaged for an hour,
and the manicure girl and hairdresser
had gone, wasn't so bad. But to-day,
with the marks of the morning's tears
on her agitated face, with the blood
pounding up to her temples where the
hair was thin and grayâ Tom Dorgan,
if I'm a vain old fool like that when
I'm three times as old as I am. just tie
a stone around my neck and take me
down and drop me into the nearest
water, won't you?
"Tou abominable little wretch!" she
sobbed. "I suppose you've told every
body in the office."
"How could I, ma'am?"*
"How could you?" She looked up,
the tears on her flabby, flushed cheek.
"I didn't know myself. I can't read
writing â "
It was thin, but Ehe wanted to be

She could have taken me In her arms,

"There! there!" she patted my shoul

a bit hasty, Nat. It's only aâ a little
business matter that Mr. Moriway's

it up this afternoon. I shouldn't like
Miss Kingdon to know of it, because â
about business, you know. So don't
mention It when she comes to-mor
row."
"No'm. Shall I fasten your dress?"
I simply had to stay In that room till
I got rid of those diamonds.
With a faded old blush â the nicest
thing about her Td ever seenâ she
turned her back.
'It's dark to-day, ma'am," I coaxed.
"Would you mind coming nearer the
window?"
No, she wouldn't mind. She backed .
up to the corner like a gentle little
lamb. While I hooked with one hand,
I dropped the bag where the carpet
was still turned up. and with the toe
of my Ehoe spread It fiat again.
"You're real handy for a boy," she
said, pleased.
"Thank you. ma'am," I answered,
pleased myself.
Moriway was still watching me, of
course, when I came out, but I ran
downstairs, he following close, and
n hen the Major got hold of me, I
pulled my pockets Inside out like a lit
tle man.
Moriway was there at the time. I
Icnew he wasn't convinced. But he
:ouldn't watch a bellboy all day long,
md the moment I was sure his eyes
vere off me I was ready to get those
ilamonds back again.
But not a call came all that after
ioon from the west side of the house,
;xcept the call of those pretty, precious
.hings snug under the carpet calling,
:alling to me to come and get them
md drop bellboying for good.
At last I couldn't stand It any long
?r. There's only one thing to do when
rour chance won't come to you; that
s, to go to It. At about four o'clock I
it out, climbed to the second story and

her and Moriway go out togetherâ sh<
all gay with finery, he carrying he:
bag. The lace curtains In 331 wen
blowing in the breeze. Cautiously '.
parted them and looked in- Every
thing was lovely. From where I lay '.
reached down and turned back the flai
of the carpet. It waa too easy. Thos<
darling diamonds seemed just to leaj
up into my hand. In a moment I hat
them tucked away in my pants pocket
Then down the fire-escape and ou 1
through 231, where I told the paintei
I'd been to get a toy the boy In 441 hac
dropped out of the window.
But he paid no attention to me. N<
one did, though I felt those diamond!
shining like an X-ray through mj
very body. I got downstairs and wai
actually outside the door, almost in thÂ«
street and off to you, when a girl called
me.
"Here, boy, carry this case," she said,
Do you know whe it was? Oh, yes,
you do, a dear old friend of mine from
Philadelphia, a young lady whose
tasteâ well, all right, I'll tell you; it
was the girl with the red coat, and the
hat with the chinchilla fur.
How did they look? Oh, fairly well
on a blonde. But to my taste the last
girl I'd seen in the coat and hat was
handsomer.
Well, I carried her suit-case and fol
lowed her back into the hotel. I didn't
want to a bit, though the coat still
wonder how she got it back!
She sailed up the hall and into the
elevator, and I had to follow. We got
off at the third story, and she brought
me right to the door of 331. And then
I knew this must be Evelyn.
"Mrs. Kingdon's out. Miss. She
didn't expect you till to-morrow."
"Did she tell you that? Too bad she
isn't at home! She said she'd be kept
busy all day to-day with a business
matter, and that I'd better not get
here till to-morrow. But Iâ"I â "
"Wanted to get here in timÂ© for the
wedding?" I suggested softly.
You should have seen her Jump.
"Wedding! Notâ"
"Mrs. Kingdon and Mr. Moriway."
She turned white.
"Has that man followed her here?
Quick, tell me. Has she actually mar
ried him?"
"No â not yet. It's for five o'clock at
the church on the corner."
"How do you know?" She turned on
me, suddenly suspicious. *
"Wellâ l do know. And I'm the only
person in the house that does."
"I don't believe you."
She took out her key and opened the
door, and I followed her In with the
suit-case. But before I could get it
set down on the floor, she swooped on
a letter that was lying in the middle of
the table, had torn it open, . and then
with a cry had come whirling toward
me.
"Where 13 this church? Come, help
me to get to it before five and I'llâ oh,
you shall have anything in the world
you want."
She flew out Into the hall, I after her.
And first thing you know we were
down In the street, around the corner,
and there In front of the church was
a carriage with Moriway Just helping
Mrs. Kingdon out.
"Mother!"
At that cry the old lady's knees
Eeemed to crumble under her. Her
poor old painted face looked ghastly
and ashamed from her wedding finery.
But Evelyn in her red coat flew to her
and took her in her arms as though she
was a child. And like a child, Mrs.
Kingdon sobbed and made excuses and
begged to be forgiven.
I looked at Moriway. It "was' the
pay I wantedâ particularly as I had
those little diamonds.
"You're Just in time, Miss Kingdon,"
he said uneasily, "to mate your moth
er happy by your presence at her wed
ding." '*'Â£&.
"I'm Just In time, Mr. Moriway, to
see that my mother's not made un
happy by your presence."
"Evelyn!" Mrs. Kingdon remon
strated.
"Come, Sarah." Moriway offered his
arm.
The bride shook her head.
"To-morrow," she said feebly.
Moriway breathed a swear.
Miss Kingdon laughed.
"I've come to take care of you, you
Billy little mother, dear. ... It
won't be to-morrow, Mr. Moriway."
" Noâ not to morrow â next week,"
sighed Mrs. Kingdon.
"In fact, mother's changed her mind,
Mr. Moriway. She thinks It ungener
ous to accept such a sacrifice from a
man who might be her son â don't you,
mother?"
"Well, perhaps, George â " She looked
up from her daughter's shoulderâ she
was crying all over that precious red
coat of mme â and her eyes lit on me.
"Oh â you wicked boy, you told a lie!"
she gasped. "You did read my letter."
I laughed; laughed out loud, it was
such a bully thing to watch Morlway's
face.
But that was an unlucky laugh of
mine; It turned his wrath on me. He
made a dive toward me. I ducked and
ran. Oh, how I ran! But If he hadn't
slipped on the curb he'd have had me.
A.s he fell, though, he let out a yell:
"Stop thief! Stop thief! Thief!
rhlef! Thief!"
' May you never hear it, Mag, behind
you when you've somebody's dia
monds in your pocket. It soundsâ lt
sounds the way the bay of the hounds
nust sound to the hare. It seems to
ly along with the air; at the same
ime to be behind you, at your side,
:ven in front of you.
I heard It bellowed in a dozen dlffer
â¢nt voices, and every now and then I
;ould hear Moriway as I pelted onâ
hat brassy, cruel bellow of his that
nade my heart sick.
And then all at once I heard a police
nan's whistle.
That whistle was like a signalâ l saw
he gates of the Correction open be-
fore me. I saw your Nancei Tom,, in
neat striped dress, and she was behin
barsâ barsâ bars! There were bar
everywhere before me. In fact, I fel
them against my very hands, for in m
mad race I had shot up a blind all e
âa street that ended in a garden be
hind an iron fence.
I grabbed the diamonds to throi
them from me, but I couldn'tâ l Jus
couldn't! I Jumped the "fence wher
the gate was law, and with that whis
tie flying shrill and shriller after me
ran tp^the house.
I might have jumped from the fry
ing-pan? Of course, I might. But I
was all fire to me. To be caught a
the end is at least no worse than to b
caught at the beginning. Anyhow, i
was my one chance, and I took it a
unhesitatingly as a rat takes a lea]
into a trap to escape a terrier. Only
only, it was my luck that the tra]
wasn't set! The room was empty,
pushed open a glass door, and fel
over an open trunk that stood be
Bide it. =Â»'
It bruised my knee and tore my hand
but oh!â it was nuts to me. For it~wa:
a woman's trunk filled with women':
things.
A skirt! A blessed skirt! And not ;
striped one. I threw off the bellboy':
jacket and I got into that dear dres:
so quick it made my" head swim.
The jacket was a bit tight, but :
didn't button it, and I'd Just got * i
stiff little hat perched on my heac
when I heard the tramp of men on th<
sidewalk,' and in the j dusk saw tht
cop's buttons at the gate.
Caught? Not much, j Not yet. :
threw open the glass doors and walkec
out into the garden.
"Missâ Omarâ l wonder if it would
be Miss Omar?" â¢
You bet I didn't take time to se<
who It was talking before I answered
Of course I was* Miss Omar. I was
Miss Anybody that had a right to weai
skirts and be inside those blessed gates
"Ahâ h! I fancied you might be
I've been expecting you." .
It was a lazy, low voice with a laugli
in it, and it came from a wheeled chair,
where a young man lay. Sallow hâ¬
was and slim and long, and helplessâ
you could see that by his white hang
ing hands. But his voiceâ it was what
a woman's voice would be if she were
a man. It made you perk up and pre
tend to be somewhere near its level.
It fitted his soft, black clothes and his
fine, clean face. It meant, silks and
velvets and â
Oh, all right, Tommy Dorgan, 11
you're going to get jealous of a voice.
"Excuse me, Mr. Latlmer." The cop
came in as he spoke, Moriway follow
ing; the resf of the hounds hung about.
"There's a thieving bellboy from the

My fingers trembled so, the bell clat
tered out of them and fell Jangling to
the ground. But it rang. ; And the
light above me went out like magic. I
fell back into a garden chair.
"I beg your pardon, Mr.â was Mori

me this evening, and I can't bear the

"Thank youâ no. If you don t mind,

That meant me. I moved toward the
gate. ,
"Not at all. Have a seat. M!?s

down. '?Â¦'Â¦Â¦ ,'Â¦-'
"Miss Omar reads to me, Mr. Mori

"It . must be. Particularly if the

He waited. But Miss Omar had
lothlng to say that minute. ." ?
"Yes, that's the name. You've got
t all right," said Latlmer. '.'An un
:ommon name, Isn't it?"
"I don't think I ever heard It before.
Do you know. Miss Omar, as I heard
Â¦our voice Just before we . got to the
rate. It sounded singularly boyish to
ne."
"Mr. Latimer does not find it soâ do
rou?" I said as sweetâ as sweet as I
:ould^coax. How sweet's that, Tom
Dorgan?
"Not at all." A little laugh came
torn Latlmer as though he was en
oylng a Joke all by himself. But Mori
vay Jumped with satisfaction. He
mew the voice all right.
."Have you a brother, may I ask?"
le leaned over and looked keenly at
ne.
"I am an orphan," I said sadly,
'with no relatives."
"A pitiful position," sneered Morl
vay. "You look so much like a boy I
mow thatâ"
"Do you really think so?" So aw
ully polite was Latlmer to such a rat
s Moriway. Why? Well, wait. "I
ant agree with you. Do you know, I
find Miss Omar very feminine. C
course, short hairâ"
"Her hair is short, then?"
"Typhoid," I murmured.
"Too bad!" Mori way sneered.
"Yes," I snapped. "I thought it wa
at the time. My hair was very heav
and long, and I had a chance to sit. I

Rotten? Of course it was. I'd n
business to gabble, and Just becaus
you and your new job, Mag. came t
my mind at that minute, there I wen
putting my foot in it â¢
Moriway laughed. I didn't like th
sound of his laugh.
"Your reader is versatile, Mr. Lati
mer," he said. '
"Yes." Latimer smoothed the sof
silk rug that lay over him. "Povert;
and that sort of versatility are oftei
bedfellows, eh? . ? . Tell me, Mr
Moriway, these lost diamonds ar>
yours?" v .'. a
"No. They belong to aâ a friend o
mine, Mrs. Kingdon." ;Â¦â¢
"Oh! the old lady who was marrie<
this afternoon to a young, fortune
hunter!" I couldn't resist it.
Moriway jumped out of his seat
"She was not married," he stuttered
"Sheâ" â¢ -
â¢ "Changed her mind? How sensibl<
of her! Did she find out what a crool
the fellow was? What was his nami
â Morrison? No â Middleway â :
have heard it." '
"May I ask, Miss Omar"â l dtdn'l
have to see his face; his voice told how
mad with rage he wasâ "how you com*
to be' acquainted. with a matter thai
only the contracting parties could pos
sibly know of?"
"Why, they can't have kept it verj
secret, the old lady and the young ras
cal who was after her money, for yov
see we both knew of It; and I wasn'l
the bride and you certainly weren'l
the groom, were you?"
An exclamation burst from him.
"Mr. Latimer," he stormed, ."may 1
see you a moment alone?"
â¢ Phew! That meant me. But I got up
just the same.
"Just keep" your seat. Miss Omar."
Oh, that silken voice of Latlmer's!
"Mr. Moriway, I have absolutely no
acquaintance with you. I never saw
you till to-night. I can't Imagine what
you may. have to say to me, that my
secretaryâ Miss Omar acts In that ca
pacityâmay not hear."
Â¦ "I ' want to say," burst from Mori
way, "that she looks the image of the
boy Nat, who stole Mrs. Kingdon's
diamonds, that the voice is exactly the
same, thatâ "
"But you have said it, Mr. Moriwayâ
quite successfully intimated it, I as
sure you." â¢ .
"She knows of myâ of Mrs. King
don's marriage, . that that boy Nat
found out atfout." .
"And you yourself also, as Miss
Omar mentioned." -. .
- "Myself? Damn it, . I'm -Moriway,
the man she.was going to marry. Why
shouldn't Iâ".
"Ah-h!" -Latimer's , shoulders shook
with'a.*gentle.laugh. â¢ "Well, Mr. Mori
way,< gentlemen ',: don't ' swear in my
garden. Particularly ; when ladies are
present. Shall we say good evening?
Here comes Mulhill now. . . Nothing,
sergeant? Too bad the rogue escaped,
but you'll catch him. They may get
away., from you, but ' they never stay
long, do they? Good eveningâ good
evening, Mr. Moriway."
. They tramped on and out, Moriway*s
very back showing rage. He whis
pered something to the Sergeant, who
turned to look at me but shook his
bead, and the gate clanged after them.
A long sigh escaped me.
"Warm, isn't It?" Latimer leaned for
ward.. "Now, would you mind ringirfg
again, Miss Omar?"
I bent and groped for the' bell and
rang, it twice.
"How quick you . are to learn!" he
said. "But I really wanted the light this
time. . . . Jus^,ligtit up. Burnett,"
he called to the man, who had come out
on the porch.
.The electric bulb flashed out again
Just over my head. Latimer turned
and looked at me. When I couldn't
bear it any longer, I looked defiantly
up at him. . 'â¢". â¢
"Pardon," she said, smiling; nice
teeth he has and clear eyes. "I was
just looking for that boyish resem
blance Mr. Moriway spoke of. I huld
to my first opinion â you're very femi
nine, Miss Omar. . . ." Will you read
to me now, if you please?" He pointed
to a big open book on the table beside
his couch. â¢ â¢
"I thinkâ if you don't mind, Mr. Lat
imer, I'll begin the reading to-morrow."
I.ROt up to go. I was through with
that garden now.
"But I do mind!" â
i Silken voice? Not * bit of it! I
turned on him sp furious I thought I
iidn't care what came of Itâ when
Dyer by the great gate-post I saw a
man crouchingâ Moriway.
I sat down again and pulled the
Dook farther toward the light.
We didn't learn much poetry at the
Cruelty, did we, Mag? But I know
some now, just the same. When I be
?an to read I heard. only one wordâ
Moriwayâ Moriwayâ Moriway. But I
nust have forgotten him after a time,

mly one spot, and the roses smelling,

book and with a queer smile that mad
me feel I hadn't quite caught on.
"Thank you, that will do." he wen
on. "That is enough, Missâ" H
stopped.
I waited.
He did not say "Omar."
I looked him square in the eyeâ an
then I had enough.
"But what In the devil did you mak
believe for?" I asked.
He smiled.

"Good night, then, and thank you

"Goodnight. . . . Oh. Missâ " H<
didn't say "Omar"â "there is a favo:
you might do me."
"Sure!" I wondered what it could be
"Those diamonds. I've got to hav<
them, you know, to . send them bad
to their owner. I don't mind helping t.
â a person who helps himself to othe!
people's things, but I can't let hin
get away with this plunder without be
ing that kind of person myself. So â '
Why didn't I He? Because there are
some people you don't lie to, Tom Dor

savage, enough. To have ringa am
pins and ear-rings, a whole bagful o!
diamonds, and to haul 'em out of youi
pocket and lay 'em on the table there
before him!
"I wonder, he said slowly, as he put
them away in his own pocket, "what a
man like me could do for a girl like
you?"
"Reform her!" I snarled. "Show hei
how to get diamonds honestly." .
Say, Tom, let's go in for bigger
game.
111.
Oh, Mag, Mag, for heaven's sake, let
me talk to you! No, don't say any
thing. .You must let me tell you. Noâ
don't call the othe/ girls.* I can't bear
to tell this to anybody but you.
You know . how I kicked when Tom
hit on La timer's as the place, we were
to scuttle. And the harder I kicked the
stubborner he got, till he swore he'd" do
the job without me if I wouldn't come
along. Wellâ thirls the rest of it.
The house you know stands at the end
of the street. If you could walk
through the garden with the iron fence
you'd come right down the bluff on
to the docks and out into East River.
Tom and I came up to- it from the
docks last night. It was dark and wet.
you remember. The mud was thick
on my trousersâ Nance Oldens a boy
, every "time ~ when 'It .comes to doing
business.', V
"We'll blow it all in, Tom," I said,
as we climbed. "We'll spend a week
at the Waldorf, and tnen, Tom Dor
gan, we'll go to Paris. I want a red
coat and hat with chinchilla, like that
dear one I lost, .and a low-neck satin
gown, ' and a silk petticoat with lace,
and a chain with rhinestones, and â "
"Just wait, Sis, till you get out of
this. And keep still."
"I can't. I'm so tidgety I must talk
or I'll shriek."
"Well, you'll shut up just the same.
Do you hear me?"
I shut up, but my teeth chattered so
that Tom stopped at the gate.
"Look here. Nance, are you going: to
flunk? Say it now â yes or no."
That made me mad.
"Tom Dorgan," I said, "lUI bet your
own teeth chattered the first time you
went in for a thing like this. I'm all
right. You'll squeal before I do."
"That's more like. Here's the gate.
It's locked. Come, Nance." ,
With a good, strong swing he boosted
me over, handed me trie bag of tools
and sprang over himself. ... He
looked kind o' handsome and fine, my
Tom. as he lit square and light on his
feet beside me. And because he did, I
put my arm in his and gave it a
squeeze. <''â¢ '
Oh, Mag, it was so funny, going
through Latimer's garden! There was
the garden table where I had sat read
ing and thinking he took me for Miss
Omar. There was the bench where
that beast Moriway sat sneering at me.
The wheeled chair was gone. And it
was so late everything: looked asleep.
But something was left behind that
made me think I heard Latimer's slow,
silken voice.^nof made. me feel cheap â
turned inside out like an empty pocket
âa dirty, ragged pocket wih a seam
n it.
"You'll stay here, Nancy, and
kvatch," Tom whispered. "You'll whis
tle once if a cop comes inside the gate,
aut not before he's inside the gate.
Don't whistle. too soon â mind that â nor
100 loud. I'll hear ye all right. And
['11 whistle just once- ifâ anything hap
pens. Then you runâ hear me? Run
ike the devilâ"
"Tommy â "
"Well, what?"
"Nothingâ all right." I wanted to say
;ood-byâ but you know Tom.
Mag, were you ever where you
)Ughtn't to be at midnightâ alone! No,
[ know you weren't. 'Twas your ugly
ittle face and your hair that saved you
-the red hair we used to guy so at the
Cruelty. I can see you nowâ a frec
iled-faced. thin little devil, with the
angled hair to the very edge. of your
agged skirt, yanked in ,that first day
o the Cruelty when the neighbors com
ilained your crying wouldn't let 'em
;leep nights. The old woman had just
ocked you in there, hadn't she, â¢to
;tarve, when she lit out. Mothers are
tueer, ain't they, when they are queer,
never remember mine. .
Yes, I'll go on. - -f/
i I stood it all right for a time, oui
there alone in the night. But I nevei
. was one to wait patiently. I can't wait
â it isn't in me. But there I had to
stand and Justâ God!â just wait.
If I hadn't waited so hard at the very
first I wouldn't "a* given out so soon.
But I stood so still and listened so ter
ribly hard that the trees began to
whisper and the bushes to crack and
creep. I heard things in my head and
ears that weren't sounding anywhere
else. And all of a sudden â tramp,
tramp, trampâ l heard the cop's foot
steps.
He stopped over there by the swing
ing electric light above the gate. I
v crouched down behind the iron bench.
And my coat caught a twig on a bush
and its crack â ck was like a yelL
I thought I'd die. I thought I'd
scream. I thought I'd run. I thought
I'd faint. But I didn'tâ for there,
asleep on a rug that some one had for
gotten to take in, was the house cat. I
gave her a quick slap and she flew out
and across the path like a flash.
The cop watched her, his hand on
the gate and passed on.
Mag Monahan, if Tom had come out
that minute without a bean and gone
home with me. I'd been so relieved I'd
never have tried again. But he didn't
come. Nothing happened. Nights and
nights went by, and the stillness began
to sound again. My throat went chok
ing mad. I began to shiver, and I
reached for the. rug the cat had lain
on..
Funny, how some things strike you!
This was Latlmer's rug. I had noticed
It that eveningâ a warm, soft, mottled
green that looked like silk and fur
mixed. I could see the way his long,
white hands locked on It. and as I
touched it I could hear his voice â
Oh. Thou, who Man of baser Earth didst
make.
And ev'n with Paradis* dertsÂ© the Snake:
For all the Sin wherewith thÂ« Face of
man
Is blacken'd â Man's forgiveness five â and
take!
Ever hear a man like that say a
thing like that? No? Well, it'sâ it's
different. It's as if the river had spok
en â or a tree â it's so â it's so different.
That saved me â that verse that I re
membei<;d. I said It over and over and
over again to myself. I fitted It to the
ferry whistles on the bay â to the cop's
steps as they passed again â to the roar
of the L-traln and the jangling of the
surface cars.
And right in the middle of itâ every
drop of blood in my body seemed to
leak out of me, and then come rush
ing back to my head â I heard Tom's
whistle.
Oh. it's easy to say "run." and I
really meant it when I promised Tom.
But you see I hadn't heard that whistle
then. It set the devil In me loose. I
felt as if the world was tearing some
thing of mine away from me. Stand
for it? Not Nance Olden.
I did run â but it was toward the
house. That whistle may have meant
"Go!" To me it yelled "Come!"
I got in through the window Tom had
left open. The place was still quiet.
Nc-body inside had heard that whistle
so far as I could tell.
I crept alongâ the carpets were thick
and soft and silky as the rug I'd had
my hands buried In to keep 'em warm.
Along a long hall and through a
great room, whose walls were thick
with books, I was making for a light
I could see at the back of the house.
That's where Tom Dorgan must be and
where I must be to find out â to know.
With my hands out in front of me I
hurried, but softly, and just as I had
reached the portieres below which the
light streamed, my arms closed about a
thing â cold as marble, naked â I
thought It was a dead body upright
there, and with a cry. I pitched for
ward through the curtains Into the
lighted room.
"Nance! â you devil!"
You recognize it? Yep, it was Tom.
Big Tom Dorgan, at the foot of Latl
mer's bed, his right hands above his
head, and Latlmer's gun aimed right
at his heart.
Think of the\pluck of that cripple,
will you?
His eyes turned on me for Just a sec
ond, and then fixed themselves again
on Tom. But his voice went straight
to me. all right.
"You are something 1 of a thankless
devil, i must admit, Miss â Omar," ha
said.
I didn't say anything. You don't say
things in answer to things like that.
You- feel 'cm.
Ashamed? "What do I care for a man
with a voice Uke that! . . . But you
should have heard how Tom's growl
sounded after It. ... 7 4 '
"Why the hell didn't you light out?"
"I couldn't, Tom. I Just couldn't,**
r sobbed. '
"There seems Invariably to be a mis
understanding of signals where Miss
Omar is concerned. Also a disposition
to use strong language in the lady's
presence. Don't you, young man!"
"Don't you call me Miss Omar!" I
blazed, stamping my foot.
He laughed a contemptuous laugh.
I could have killed him, then. I hated
dim so. At least. I thought I could:
but just then Tom sent a spark out of
the corner of his eye to me that meant .
âit meantâ
You know, Mag. what It would have
meant to Latimer if I had done what
roms eye said.
I thousht at first I had done Itâ lt
passed through my mind so quick; the
sweet words I'd say â the move I'd
makeâ the quick knocklng-up of the
pistol, and then â
It was thatâ that sight of Tom. biff
Fom Dorgan. with rage In his heart i
tnd death in his hand, leaping on that
.Tipple's bodyâ lt made me sick!
I stood there gaspingâ stood a mo
ment too long. For the curtains werÂ«
rushed aside, and Burnett. Latimer's
servant, and the cop came In.
Tom didn't fight; he's no fool to
vaste himself. '
But Iâ well, never mind about me. I
raught a glimpse of a crazy white face
>n a boy's body in the great glass op-IV.
No â no â no! No more whining from
Nance Olden. Listen to what I've got
to tell you, Mag, listen!
You know where I was coming from
yesterday when I passed Troyon's
window and grinned up at you, sitting
there, framed in bottles of hair tonic,
with that red wig of yours streaming
about you?
Yep. from that little, rat-eyed law
yer's office. I was glum as mud. I
felt as though Tom and myself were
both flies caught by the leg â he by the
law and I by the lawyerâ in a sticky
mess; and the more we flapped our
wings and struggled and pulled, the
more we hurt and tore ourselves, and
the sooner we'd have to give it up.
Oh. that wizened-faced little lawyer
that lives on the Tom Dorgans and the
Nance Oldens, who don't know which
way to turn to get the money! He
looks at me out of his little eyes and
measures in dollars what I'd do for
Tom. And then he sets hia price a
nc-tch higher than that.
When I passed the big department
store, next to Troyon's. I was thinking
of this, and I turned in there. Just
aching for some of the boodle that
flaunts itself in a poor girl's face when
she's desperate, from every silk and
pat in rag, from every lace and Jewel
In the placp.
The funny part of it is that I didn't
want it for myself, but ror Tom. 'Pon
my soul, Mag, though I would have
filled my arms with everything I saw,
I wouldn't have put on one thing of
all the dud?: just hiked off to soak 'em
and pay the lawyer. I 'might have
been as old and ugly and rich as the
yel!ow-s!;inned woman opposite me.
who was 'turning over Taces on the
middle counter, for all these things
ni^ant to me â with Tom in Jail. .
I was thinking this as I looked at
hÂ«*r, when all at once I saw â
You know it takes a pretty quick
touch, charp eyes and good nerve to
get away with the goods in a big shop
like that. Or it takes numething alto
gether different. It was the different
v.ay she did it. She took up the piece
of laceâ It was a big collar, fine like a
cobweb picture in threadsâ you can
guess what it must have been worth
if that old sinner. Mother Douty, gave
me 515 for it. She took it up in a quick
eager way, as though she'd found
just what she wanted. Then she took
out a lace sample from her gold-linked
purse and held them both up close to
her bllnky little eyes, looking at It
through a gold lorgnette with emeralds
in the handle; pulling: it and feeling it
with the air of one who knows a fine
thing when she seees it, and Just what
makes it fine. Then she rustled off to
the door to examine it closely in the
liprht, and â Mag Monahan, she walked
right out with it!
At least she got beyond the inner
door when I tapped her on the shoulder.
"I beg pardon, madam." My best
style. Mag. *â¢;â¢ Â»~ ;
She pulled herself up haughtily and
nked at me. She was a little, thin
y of a v.oman. Just wrapped
silks and velvets, but on the
t nervous, little old body
"I have changed my mind," she said,
"and shall give you the lace back. I
will not keen it. I cannot â I cannot
bear the sight of it. It terrifies me
and shocks me. I can take no pleasure
in it. Besidesâ besides, it will be dis
cipline for me to do without it now that
I have found it after all these years.
Every day I shall look at the place in
my collection which it would have oc
cupied, and I shall say to myself:
'Maria Van Wagenen, take warning.
See to what terrible straits a worldly
passion may bring one; what uncon
scious greefl may do!' I shall give the
money to Mills for charity and I will
neverâ never fill that place in my' col
lection."
"What good will that do?" I asked,
puzzled, while I folded the collar up
into a very small package.
"Ycu mean that I ought to submit
to the exposure â that I deserve the
lesson and the punishmentâ not for
stealing, but for being absorbed in
worldly things. Perhaps you are right.
It certainly shows that you have at
some time been under Mills' spiritual
care, my dear. I wonder if he would
Insist â whether I ought â yes, I suppose
he would. Oh!"
A saleswoman's head was thrust in
the door. "Excuse me," she said, "I
thought the room was empty."
"We've just finished trying on," I
said sweetly.
"Don't go!" The Bishop's wife
turned to her, her little fluttering
hands held out appealingly. "And do
not misunderstand me. The thing may
seem wrong in your eyes, as this young
woman says, but if you will listen pa
tiently to my explanation, I am sure
you will see that it was a mere eager
oversightâ the fault of absent-minded
ness, hardly the sin of covetousness,
and surely not a crime. I am making
this confessionâ"
The tender conscience of the dear,
blameless little soul! She was actually
giving herself away. "Worse â she was
giving me away, too. But I couldn't
stand that. I saw the . saleswoman's
puzzled face â she was a tall woman
with a big bust, big hips and the big
head all right, and she wore her long
train black rig for all the world like a
Cruelty girl who had stolen the ma
tron's skirts to "play lady" in. I got
behind little Mrs. Bishop, and looking
out over her head, I tapped my fore
head significantly.
The saleswoman tumbled. That was
all right. But so did the Bishop's wife;
for she turned and caught me at it.
"You shall not save me from myself
Ohâ Mag! Shame on you not to
know the name even of the Bishop of
the great State ofâ yes, the lean, short
little Bishop with a little white beard,
and the softest, eye and the softest
heart and â my very own Bishop, Nancy
Olden's Bishop. And this was his wife.
Tutâ tut, Mag! Of course not. A
Bishop's wife may be a kleptomaniac;
it's only Cruelty girls that really steal
from stores.
"I've met the Bishop, Mrs. Van
Wagenen." I didn't say how â she
wouldn't appreciate that story. "And
he was once very kind to me. But he
would be the first to tell me to do my
duty now. I'll do it as quietly as I
can for his sake. But you must come
with me or I must arrest â "
She put up a shaking hand. Dear
little old guy!
"Don't â don't say it! It's all a mis
take, which can be rectified in a mo
ment. I've been trying to match this
piece of lace* for years. I got it at
Malta whenâ when Mills" and Iâ on our
honeymoon. When I saw it there on
the counter I was so delighted â I never
thoughtâ I intended taking it to the
light to be sure the pattern was the
same, my eyesight is so wretchedâ and
when you spoke to me it was the first
inkling I had that I had really taken
it without paying! You certainly un
derstand," she pleaded in agitation. "I
have no need to steal â you must *know
thatâ Oh, that I wouldn'tâ that I
couldn'tâ If you will just let me pay
you â "
Here now, Mag Monahan, don't you
get to sneering. She vras straight â
right on the level, all right. You
couldn't listen to that cracked little
voice of hers a minute without being
sure of It.
I was just about to permit her gra
ciously to pay me the money â for my
friend, the dear Bishop's sake, of
course â when a big floorwalker hap
pened to catch sight or us.
"If you'll come with me, Mrs. Van
Wagenen, to a dressing-room, I'll ar
range your collar for you," I said very
loud. And then, in a whisper: "Of
course, I understand, but the thing may
look different to other people. And
that big floorwalker there gets a com
mission from the newspapers every
time he tells themâ"
She gave a squawk for all the world
like a dried-up little hen scuttling out
of a yellow dog's way, and we took
the elevator to the second floor.
The minute I closed the door of the
little fitting-room she held out the lace
to me.
MRS. MILLS D. VAN WAGENEN
"Sh! We don't like any noise made
about these things, and you yourself
wouldn't enjoy â "
"Do you know who I am, young
woman?" She fumbled In her satchel
and passed a card to me.

never guess, you dear old Mag! Be
sides, you haven't got the acquain
tance in high society that Nance Olden

"Butâ 1
of hers there must have been some
spring of good material that wasn't all
unwound yet.
She stood blinking at me without a
word.
"That lace. You haven't paid for
it," I said.
"Oh, mercy! You â you don't â "

She acts the Lady P.- '--oness, come to

diamonds. There's the Lady's coronet
in her hair. Her thin little arms are
banded with gold and diamortds. and
on her neckâ O Mag, Mag, that rose

"There's a girl named Nancy Olden
that could tell you a lot, smart as you
are. She could show you the inside of
the Cruelty, where she was put so
young she never knew that children
had mothers and fathers, till a red
haired girl named Mag Monahan told
her; and then she was mighty glad
she hadn't any. She thought that all
little girls were bloodless and dirty and
all little boys were tilthy and had
black and purple marks where their
fathers had tried to gouge out their
eyes. She thought all women were
like the matron who came with a visi
tor up to the bare room, where we
played without toysâ the new, dirty,
newly bruised ones of us. and the old,
clean, healing ones of usâ and said.
'Here, chicks, is a lady who's come to
see you. Tell her how happy you are
here.' Then Mag's freckled face, her
finger in her mouth, looked up like
this. She was afraid it might be her
mother come for her. And the crippled
boy jerked .himself this wayâ I used to
mimic him, and he'd laugh with the
rest of themâ over the bare floor. He
always hoped for a penny. Sometimes
he even got it.
"And the boy with the gouged eye
he would hold his pants up like this.
He had just come in and there was
nothing to fit him. And he'd put his
other hand over hfe bad eye and blink
up at her like this. And the littlest
boyâ oh, ha! ha! ha!â you ought have
seen that littlest boy. He was in
skirts, an old dress they'd given me to
wear the first day I came; there were
no pants small enough for him. He'd
back up into the corner and hide his
face â like this â and peep over his
shoulder; he had a squint that way,
that made his face look funny. See,
it makes you laugh yourself. But his
bodyâ my Godâ it was blue with welts!
And me â I'd put the baby down that'd
been left on the doorsteps of the Cru
elty, and I'd waltz up to the lady, with
her handkerchief to her nose and her
lorgnette to her eyes â see, like this. I
knew just what graft would work her.
I knew what she wanted there. I'd
learned. So I'd make her a cuhtsy like
this, and in the piousest sing-song
I'dâ"
There was a heavy step out in the
hall â it was the policeman! I'd forgot
while I was talking. I was back â back
in the empty' garret, at the top of the
Cruelty. I could smell the smell of the
poor, the dirty, weak, sick poor. I
could taste the porridge in the thick
little bowls, like those in the bear
story Molly tells the kids. I could
hear the stifled sobs that wise, poor
children give â quiet ones, so they'll not
be beaten again. I could feel the night,
when strange, deserted, tortured babies
lie for the first time, each In his small
white cot, the new ones waking the
old with their cries in a nightmare of
what had happened before they got to
the Cruelty. I could see the world
barred over, as I saw it first through
the Cruelty's barred windows, and a3
I must see it again, now that â
"You see, you don't know it quite all
âyet, Mr. Manager!" I spat it out at
him, and then walked to the cop, my
hands ready for the bracelets.
â¢"But there's one thing I do know!"
He's a big fellow but quick on his
feet, and in a minute he was up and
between me and the cop. "And there
isn't a theatrical man in all America
that knows it quicker than Fred Ober
muller, that can detect it sooner and
develop it better. And you've got it,
girl, you've got it! ... Officer, take
this for your trouble. I couldn't hold
the fellow, after all. Never mind which
Â¦way he went; I'll call up the office and
explain."
He shut the door after the cop, and
came back to me. I had fallen into a
chair. My knees were weak and I
was trembling all over.
"Have you seen the playlet Charity
at the Vaudeville?" he roared at me.
I shook my head.
"Well, it's a scene In a foundling
asylum. Here's a pass. Go up now
and see it. If you hurry you'll get
there just in time for that act. Then
if you come to me at the office in the
morning at ten, I'll give you a chance
as one of the Charity girls. Do you
want it?"
God, Mag! Do I want it!
Do you remember Lady Patronesses'
day at the Cruelty, Mag? Remember
how the place smelt of cleaning am
monia on the bare floors? Remember
the black dresses we all wore, and the
white aprons with the little bibs, and
the oily sweetness of the matron, and
how our faces shone and tingled from
the soap and the rubbinfe? Remember
it all?
Well, who'd 'a' thought then that
Nance Olden ever would make use of
Itâ on the level, too!
Drop the Cruelty, and tell you about
the stage? Why, it's bare boards back
there, bare as the Cruelty, but oh,
there's something that you don't see,
but you feel itâ something magic that
makes you want to pinch yourself to
be sure you're awake. I go round there
just doped with it; my face, if you
' could see It, mut* look like Molly's
kid's when she Is telling him fairy
stories.
I love it, Mag! I love It!
And what do I do? That's what I
was trying to tell you about the Cruelty
for. It's in a little act that was made
for Lady Gray, that there are four
Charity girls on the stage, and I'm
one of 'em.
Lady Gray? Why, Mag how can you
ever hope to get on If you don't know,
who's who? How can you expect me
to associate with you if you're -o igno
rant? Yesâ a real Lady, as real as the
wife of a Lord can be. Lord Harold
Gray's a sure enough Lord, and she's
hands dripping, and not a lie in, her
smart mouth!
He picked up the bills I had dropped,
counted them and ,put them in his
pocket. Then he unhooked a telephone
and lifted the stand from his desk.
"Hello! Spring 310Oâ please. Hello!
Chiefs' office? This is Obermuller,
Standard Theater, j I want an officer
to take charge of a thief I've caught
in my apartments here at the Bron
sonia. Yes, right on the corner. Hold
him till you come? Wellâ rather!"
He put dawn the 'phone. I pulled
the pearl studs out of my pocket.
"You might as well take these, too,"
I said.
"So thoughtful of you, seeing that
you'd be searched! But I'll take 'em.
anyway. You intended them forâ
him? You didn't get anything else'"
I shook my head as I lay there.
"Hum!" It was half a laugh and
half a sneer. I hafed him for it, as he
sat leaning back on the back legs oi
his chair, his thumbs in his arm-holes.
I felt his eyesâ those smart, keen eyes,
burning into my miserable head. I
thought of the lawyer and the deal
he'd give poor Tom, and all at once â
You'd have sniffled yourself, Mag
Monahan. There I wasâ taught. The
cop'd be after me in five minutes.
With Tom jugged and me in stripes
it wasn't very Jolly, and I lost my
nerve.
"Ashamedâ huh?" he said lightly.
I nodded. I was ashamed.
"Pity you didn't get ashamed before
you broke in here."
"What the devil was there to be
ashamed of?"
The sting in his voice had cured me.
I never was a weeper. I sat up, my
face blazing, and stared at him. He'd
got me to hand over to the cop, but he
hadn't got me to sneer at.
I saw by the look he gave me that he
hadn't really seen me till then.
"Well," he answered, "what the
devil is there to be asnamed of now?"
"Of being caughtâ that's what."
"Oh!"
He tilted back again o*n his chair and
laughed softly.
"Then you are not ashamed of your
profession?"
"Are you of yours?"
"Well â there's a slight difference."
f Not much, whatever it may be. It's
your graft â it's everybody's â to take
all he can get, and keep out c/f jail.
That's mine, too."
"But you see I keep out of jail."
"I see you are not there â yet."
"Oh, I think you needn't worry about
that. I'll keep out, thank you; im
prisonment for debt don't go nowa
days."
"Debt."
"I'm a theatrical manager, my girl,
and I'm not on the inside; which is an
other way of saying that a man who
can't swim has fallen overboard."
"And when you go down â "
"A little less exultation, my, dear, or
I might suppose yoe'd be glad when I
do." I
"Well, when you kÂ£ow yourself going
down for the last time, do you mean
to tell me you won't'^grasp" at a straw
likeâ like this?" I npdded toward the
open window, and the desk with all its
papers tumbling outt '*
"Not much." He 'shook his head, and
bit the end of a clgpir with sharp, white
teeth. "It's a fool grart. I'm self-re
specting. And I don't admire fools."
He lit his cigar and puffed a minute,
taking out his watch to look at 4t, as
cold-bloodedly as though we were
waiting, he and I, to go to supper to
gether. Oh, how I hated him!
"Honesty isn't the best policy," . he
went on; "it's the only one. The vain
fool that gets it into his head â or shall
I say her head? No? Well, no offense,
I assure you â his head then, that he's
smarter than a world full of experi
ence, ought to be put in Jailâ for his
own protection; he's too big a jay to
be left out of doors. For five thousand
years, more or less, the world has been
putting people like him behind bars,
where they can't make asses of. them
selves. Yet every year, and every day
and every hour, a new ninny is born
who fancies he's cleverer than all his
predecessors put together. Talk about
suckers! Why, they're giants of intel
lect compared to the mentally lopsided
that five thousand years of experience
can't teach. When the criminal
clown's turn> comes, he hops, skips and
Jumps into the ring with the old, old
gag. He thinks it's new, because he
himself Is so fresh and green. 'Here I
am again,' he yells, 'the fellow that'll
do you up. Others have tried it.
They're dead in jail or under Jail
yards. But meâ just watch me!' We
do, and after a little we put him with
his mates and a keeper in a barred
kindergarten where fools that can't
learn, little moral cripples of both
sexes, : my dear, belong. Bah!" He
puffed out the smoke, throwing: his
head back, in a cloud toward the ceil
ing.
\ I Bprang' from my seat and faced
him. I was tingling all through. I
didn't care a rap what became of me
for Just that minute. I forgot about
Tom. I prayed that the cop wouldn't
come for a minute yet â but only that I
might answer him.
"You're mighty smart, ain't you?
You can sit back here and sneer at me,
can't you? And feel so big and smart
and triumphant! What've you done
but catch, a girl at her first bungling
job! It makes you feel awfully cocky,
don't it? 'What a big man I am!"
Bah!" 1 blew the smoke up toward
the ceiling from my r mouth, with Just
that satisfied gall that he had; or
rather, I pretended to. He let down
the front legs of his chair and began
to stare at me.
"And you don't know it all, Mr.
Manager, not you. Your clown-crimi
nal dem't jump into the ring because
he's so full of fun he can't stay out.

real clown doesâ because he gets hun

stomach and cover his back and get a

create the contrary impression. I de

"An interview with the manager," I
interrupted. "I'm sure Mrs. Van
Wagenen can see the manager. Just
go with the lady, Mrs. Van Wagenen,
and I'll follow with the goods."
She did it meek as a lamb, talking
all the time, but never beginning at the
beginningâ luckily for me. So that I
had time to slip from one dressing
room to the next, with the lace up my
sleeve, out to the elevator and down
into the street.
D'ye know what heaven must be,
Mag? A place where you always get
away with, the swag, and where it's
always just the minute after you've
made a killing.
Cocky? Well, I should say I was. I
was drunk enough i with ! success to
take big chances. And just while I
was wishing for something really big
to tackle, it came along in the shape
of that big floorwalker!
He was without a hat, and his eyes
looked fifty ways at once. But you've
got to look fifty-one if you want to
catch Nance Olden. I ran up the stairs
of the first fiat-house and rang the bell.
And as I sailed up in the ele.vator I
saw the big floorwalker hurry past;
he'd lost the scent. â¢ .V-
The boy let me off at the top floor,
and after the elevator had gone down
I walked up to the roof. It was fine
'way up there, so still and high, with
the lights coming out down in the
town. And I took out my pretty lace
collar and put it around my neck,
wishing I could keep it and wishing
that I had, at least, a glass to see my
self in it just once, when my eye
caught the window of the next house.
It would do for a mirror all right,
for the dark green 6hade was down.
But at sight of the shade blowing in
the wind I forgot all about the collar.
It's this way, Mag, when they press
you too Tsr;and that little rat of a
lawyer had got me most to the wall. I
looked at the window, measuring the
little climb it would be for me to get
to itâ the house next door was just
one story higher than the- one where
I was, so its top story was on a level
with the roof where I stood. And I
made up my mind to get what would
let Tom off easy, or break into jail my
self. â¢
And so I didn't care much what I
might fall into through the window.
And perhaps because I didn't care, I
slipped into a dark hall, and not a
thing stirred; not a footstep creaked. I
felt like the princessâ Princess Nancy
Olden â come to wake the Sleeping
Beauty; some dude it'd be that would
have curly hair like Tom Dorgan's,
and would wear clothes like my friend
Latimer's, over in Brooklyn.
Can you see me there, standing on
one leg like a stork, ready to lie or to
fly at the first sound. Â»
Well, the first sound aidn't come.
Neither did the second. In fact, none
of 'em came unless I, made 'em myself.
Softly as Molly goes when the baby's
just dropped off to sleep, I walked to
ward an open door. It was a parlor,
smelly with tobacco, and with lots of
papers and books around. And nary a
he-beautyâ nor any other kind.
I tried the door of the room next to
it. A bedroom. But no Beauty.
Silly! Don't you tumble yet? It was
a bachelor's apartment, and the Bach
elor Beauty j was out,* and Princess
Nancy had the place all to herself.
I suppose I really ought to have left
my card â or he wouldn't know who
had waked him â but I hadn't intended
to go calling when I lert nonie. So I
thought I'd look for one of his as a
souvenir â and anything else, of his I
could make use of.
There were shirts 1*0 like for Tom,
dandy colored ones, and suits with
checks in 'em and without. But I
wanted something easy and small and
flat, made of crackly printed yellow
or green paper, with numbers on it.
How did I know he had anything like
that? Why, Mag, Mag Monahan, one
would think you ' belonged to the
Bishop's set, you're so' simple!
I had to turn on the electric light
after a bit â it got so dark. And I
don't like light in other people's houses
when they're not at home, and neither
am I. But there was nothing' in the
bedroom except some pearl studs. I
got those and then went back to the
parlor.
The desk caught my eye. Oh, Mag,
it had the lovlliest pictures on itâpic
tures of swell actresses and dancers.
It was mahogany, with lots of- little
drawers and two curvy side boxes. I
pulled open all the drawers. They
were full of papers all right, but they
were printed, cut, from newspapers,
and all about theaters.
"You can't feed things like this,
Nance, to that shark of a lawyer," I
said to myself, pushing the box on the
side Impatiently.
And then I giggled outright.
Why?
Just 'causeâ I had pushed that side
box till it swung aside on hinges I
didn't know about, and there, in a little
secret nest, was a pile or those same
crisp, crinkly paper things I'd been
looking for.
20â40â60â110â16O-210â260â310 !
Three hundred and ten dollars, Mag
Monahan. Three hundred and ten, and
Nance Olden.
"Glory be!" I whispered.
"Glory be damned!" I heard behind
me.
I turned. The bills just leaked out
of my hand on to the floor.
The Bachelor Beauty had come home,
Mag, and nabbed the poor princess,
instead of her catching him napping.
He wasn't a beauty eitherâ a big.
stout fellow with a. black mustache.
His hand on my shoulder held me
tight, but the look in his. eyes behind
his glasses, held me tighter. I threw
out my arms over the desk and hid my
face.
Caught! Nancy Olden, with he
"Get Tern out of Jail."
He shc-ok his head.
"I'm too good a friend of yours to do
you such a turn."
I don't want any friend that lsn t
Tom's." .
He threw the pistol from him and
pulled himself up, till he sat looking at
me.
â¢â¢What's that to you?" I turned to go.
â¢â¢To me? Things of that sort are
nothing of course, to me-me, that

"How did you know?"
"How? The glass. See over yonder.
I could watch every expression on both
your faces. What was itâ what was
it child, that made youâ oh, if you owe
me a single heart-beat of gratitude,

"You've said it yourself."
"What?" .
"That line we read the other night
about 'the luckless po-f."
His face went gray and he fell back
on his pillows. The strenuous life we'd
been leading him. Tom and I, was too
much for him, I guess.
Do you know. I really felt sorry I d

LâJ getting great and far-reach-
JL )Â¦ ing happiness from the ex
%S quislte little Joys of life."
Thus the hero of a short
story in one of our current
magazines is characterized by the
author and what a splendid thing
It is to be able to say that either of
a man in a story or a man in real life.
When you have reached the point
where you do not need a rare piece of
good fortune or a trip to Europe or a
unique relationship to the great and
mighty of the earth to make you happy
you have mastered the secret of con
tented and fruitful living. When the
play of the sunshine across your desk,
the laughter of a little child, the cheery
greeting of a friend .who meets and
passes you In the crowd, a page out of
a new book or any one of the compara
tively trifling experiences which befall
you between sunrise ana sunset can
make you deeply and unfelgnedly
happy you can bid defiance to all the
black bats' of fear and trouble which
hover about your dally pathway.
The little things that together com
prise the life of a single day ought to
yield us joy. In the Bame story from
which I have quoted taÂ» author refers
to the great happiness which comes
"from the blessed continuance of the
unnoticed dally good." Whenever the
routine looks bare and tedious to us
let us think how we should feel if
something interposed to bring It to a
sharp conclusion. If some illness or
disability prevents one from going to
his daily task, how he yearns for a
return to the former routine. Pray,
is it nothing to you that you arose
this morning In health, that you can
take up your duties ia the full posses
sion of your reason, that you have
some honest profitable work to do In
God's' great working world T The other
day a well-known American authoress
was burned out. But instead of crying
over the catastrophe she wrote as fol
lows: "I lost nearly everythingâprice
less books, all my notebooks of years
of work. Well, to be alive and well
is good.".
One can harvest, too, a crop of Joys
by being responsive to the beauty and
order of the universe in which we live.
An elevator boy said to me the other
day, "I ought to be thankful that fes
my car moves f rom floor, to, floor -I can
get such frequent glimpses of the sun
shine and the sky." How foolish we
are to fail to notice the loveliness of
tiny things in nature, the blending of
colors in the violet, the glory of a single
star, the thrilling song which the little
bird pours forth. You can connect with
many of these sources of Joy without
hardly stirring from your tracks, only
thtr* must be the ear to listen, tha
eye to see, the mind to appreciate, and
if you are absorbed in the fluctuations
of the stock market or the perplexities
of housekeeping you are likely to pass
them all by as too small for considera
tion.
The loves of our life may make us
profoundly happy and true love ex
presses Itself In a hundred little ways.
What you really love about your little
boy. is not 'merely the man that you
see he Is going to be by and by, but
the fact that he toddles toward the
door the moment he hears your key in
the lock and gives an exultant shout
when he feels your arms about him.
The man who postpones the pleasure
that he is to get out of his kinships
and friendships to the time when he
can sit down and take In fully and
scientifically the dimensions of that
love makes a vital mistake. Learn to
â¢enjoy your children, your . home and
your friends as you go along.
And it is marvelous, too, how the lit
tle services for others react and pour
a flood of Joy into your own life. That
Is the delight of doing something for
the childâ a penny present often counts
for as much in his eyes as a $10,000
check. And people generally are
helped more than you realize by a
small offering on your part provided
your heart goes with it. And the mo
ment that" we realize how we have
served another's need another fountain
of ; happiness is opened In our own
hearts.
God put us In this world to be happy.
Philosophers have fought over the
proposition whether virtue or happiness
Is the main end of living, but no
system of ethics leaves us any right to
be gloomy and even that stiff old
theological document known as the
Westminster Cathechism affirms that
one of the chief ends of men is to enjoy
God forever. But if we are going to
enjoy God and heaven by and by we
must establish at once here a habit of
forcing little things to yield us their
proper meed of delight.
THE LARGE IN THE LITTLE
By the Parson
Â°m
Clothe this figure in the most unob
trusive of business suits, a little black
tie. and a 6quare-crowned derby, ar.d
yon have the picture of the man whom
a Brooklyn paper In 1902 epoke of in
these words: "Away back in 1S82 a
youug man of small stature and with
a Quick, nervous manner was fre
quently to be 6een passing by the old
office cf the Brooklyn Eagle, on lower
Fultcn nreet. He was cne of the sons
of the big sugar refiner, whose factory
was -t the corner of Dock and Water
etreets. near Fulton ferry." It was
Henry T. Oxnard, fresh from his grad
uation at Harvard, and ready for his
first actual experience in the business
in which his father and grandfather
had engaged before him. At Harvard
while In his sophomore year he had the
friendship of Theodore Roosevelt, then
a senior. When Roosevelt bade good-by
to college Oxnard moved Into the quar
ters which the future President had
occupied, acquiring some of the de-
Parting graduate's belongings in bo
doing.
A combination of English and French
ancestry of the beet sort were the fac
tors in giving to Henry T. Oxnard, him
self born in Marseilles. France. In I860,
while his father's family were traveling
abroad, his qualities of persistence,
thrift and finesse. His English ancestor
came to America in 1740 and settled in
Boston, having been sent by Lord Mon
tague, the father of Freemasonry in
the New World, to further the estab
lishment of that order in its new home
as the provincial master of all Amer
ica. Since then the Oxnard family has
been prominent in New Englandâ
Americans of the most progressive
type.
The mother-of Henry T. Oxnard came
from an old "Trench family of Louisi
ana, whose ancestry dated back to the
Capets. His father disposed of his ex
tensive cane sugar plantations and re
fineries in Louisiana in 1860 and es
caped the dangers of the Civil War by
travel. Shortly after the birth of the
future magnate Thomas Oxnard re
turned to his old home in Massachu
setts. Here young Henry T. grew up.
loving the country and an out-of-door
life and starting in his first business by
raising chickens on an extensive scale.
1 WANTED to see Henry Thomas
Oxnard, one of the manipulators
and dictators of beet sugar busi
nesses and policies in the wide
United States, to draw my own con
clusions as to the personality of a man
who had long occupied so prominent a
place in the public eye. I had some
difficulty in setting track of him. I
missed him at the home of a relative
In the city, who rang the keynote of
the man's life story and character when
she Eaid: "You have to get up early
to catch him. He's small, I know, but
he has always been full of purpose. Â¦'
When you know Henry T. Oxnard
you realize that pugnacious tenacity
of purpose is the dominant trait in his
character. When you simply meet him
his nose and chin cry out this fact at
you. His grayish eyes, set well apart
In a clear complexion, express the
kindliness which Is part of him. Under
the aggressive mustache the straight
lips are those of a man who can say
"no" if need be. The forehead, broad
and deep, which meets a somewhat
eparse covering of slightly sandy hair,
betokens brains of the solid, practical,
achieving sort. His round head is well
Â¦et above good shoulders and a stout,
comfortable looking body of medium
height. Not a brilliant outward make

won the cause which he championedâ
that of the beet sugar men.
Mr. Oxnard erected the first beet
*uxar factory in the southern portion
of California in 1891, when ha pur
chased thft famous Richard Gird
ranch at Ciino. In 1898 he erected
the most complete beet sugar factory
in the world at Oxnard. It cost nearly
$2,000,000 and devours 2000 tons of
beets per day. In these California
factories are Invested $10,130,519,
one-half of all the capital invested in
the beet sugar industry in the United
States. More than a thousand men
are employed by them and more than
$500,000 Is paid out in wages each
year. These factorie- render Mr. Ox
nard the fountain head from which
accrues to the farmers in California
more than $1,500,000 annually.
In the dally affairs of the lighter
side of life, Henry T. Oxnard's love
for fine horseflesh perhaps comesnext
to his capacity for work. Next to
horses he is fond of dogs and is al
ways the owner of some good ones.
When he first started as an owner and
breeder of thoroughbred horses he
purchased only brood mares and had
them scattered among the various
breeding farms of the East, to study
the different strains of blood produced
and so find out what he wanted.
At various times he has owned the
most select collection of brood mares
in this country. Mr. Oxnard has
owned Lux Casta, a speedy fllly; Va
lentino, Invincible and Wealth, cele
brated runners. He owns Hawks
wick, a celebrated English bred stal
lion, and has recently purchased the
two most promising stallions he could
find. Prince of Melbourne and Inflex
ible. His horses have been run in
England, . Saratoga, Bennings, New
Orleans and other racing centers. In
his personal scrapbook he keeps a
record of their achievements. Mr.
Oxnard has a large stock farm in Fau
quier County, Va., called Beverly
Place. In addition to his fine ranch
of 5700 acres In Ventura County, ha
has recently purchased a stock farm
of 11:000 acres in the same county,
where he will keep some of his finest
horses and thoroughbred cattle. In
which he also is greatly interested.
While Mr. Oxnard spenda a larjr
part of his time in California, most el
It at his country home In Oxnard. hÂ«
of necessity travels a great deal, some
times making a round trip to the East
three or four times during the year.
His love of home is strong, and there Is
no time but that, as he says, "my fam
ily are my chief Interest, rather than
business or politics." His love of Jol
lity and fun comes out perhaps most
strongly in his home life, as with many
men of busy lives. His wife before her
marriage in France some years ago
was Miss Marie Pichon, and 1j a very
handsome and accomplished woman.
There are two children, Adeline, a
blooming little miss of 3, a stanch com
rade of her father, and Nadlne, who
has only a little over 6 months to her
credit in the way of age.
One or the most striking character
istics of Mr. Oxnard Is his entire ab
sence of formality, even with a casual
acquaintance. He Is known by the
people in his residence sec*Joa as kind
hearted and democratic, and with the
rare but Inbred faculty of at ones plac
ing the humblest visitor at hid ease.
With his family he has been spending
the past winter In Los Angeles, bavins
rented a handsome home on Figueroa
street, in the fine residence section.
The home at Oxnard 13 not an ostenta
tious one, and the life thera is simple.
that of a country gentleman who lovÂ«s
the quiet by which he is surroun led.
Music is a favorite part of the evenings
of home life. Driving forms a part of
the pleasure of almost every day, and
one of the favorite vehicles, especially
of the little Adeline, to drive out
with .her father. Is a Parisian tub cart
of latest design, drawn by one of the
fine horses for which the Oxnard sta
bles are famous. The large house la
surrounded by beautiful grounds, typi
cal of California, and Is situated not
more than a mile from the factory,
where the millionaire spends much of
his time when at Oxnard. His regis
tered place of residence for the past
few years has been Hueneme, a little
coast town a few miles away.
Oxnard has been the home cf Mr.
Oxnard for most of tho time during the
past six years or more, and many of
his friends, among the best known peo
ple of the hour, are entertained here
and at his Los Angeles residence In the
royal manner which belongs to the
open-hearted generosity of the West.
While more domestlo than a clubman
In his tastes perhaps, Mr. Oxnard is a
member of the California Club in Los
Angeles and of the San Francisco and
Pacific-Union clubs in San Francisco.
With hotel life in New York, as he has
no home establishment there, club life
makers more demands upon him and h<s
is well known in the exclusive clubs of
Washington and New York. He also
maintains offices in the latter city at
32 Nassau street. In the heart of thÂ«*
financial district. Should he ba nomi
nated as a resident of California to
flsht for the post of honor which he
acknowledges he desires, he will Â»nter
the political arena with the triple and
valuable armament of decision, daring
and, last but by no means least, a
goodly supply of practical political ex
perience gained at Washington during
the sugar fight.
Mr. Oxnard and his beautiful wifa
may often be seen among the spec
tators at the various tracks of the
East, notably at tha Chevy Chase
hunts at Washington, T>. C. It was
here that a society reporter gave him
tcÂ« following effusive description:
"HÂ« aeams possessed of tireless ener
gy and no girl can smile more s-veet
ly." As would naturally be expected
in a. man so partial to horses and
dogs. Mr. Oxnard Is an enthusiastic
hunter and t known oj a sure, quick
shot Many of his days when time
permits are spent with his dogs In the
out-of-door life which ha lores â¢â¢
well.
It was In the fight in Congress
against the reduction of duties on Cu
ban sugars that some of the most
marked characteristics of the man were
brought out; his tireless energy when
something is to be achieved; the fact
that with his tenacity of purpose goes
the capacity for being a good hater;
his remarkable knowledge of men and
the almost intuitive art of manipulat
ing them to suit his own purposes. He
had opposed other things, such as the
annexation of Hawaii and the making
of Porto Rico a part of the United
States, but the Cuban sugar fight made
him for the first time almost a na
tional figure and subjected him to ava
lanches of criticism and accusation,
and such titles as "double dealer" and
"promoter," but he gained his end and
After his college career came his first
actual experience In the business of his
life, which was gained. In company
with two of his brothers, In the Brook
lyn sugrar factory. Through observa
tion and study he conceived the idea
that by virtue of soil and climate the
United States should be able to produce
Its entire supply of sugar, instead of
importing over $100,000,000 annually.
"With his brother, James Oxnard, he
spent some time abroad, traveling
through France, Germany and Austria,
Investigating the beet sugar industry
of Europe. In 1S87 the great sugar trust
was formed and the Oxnards sold their
plant for over 51,000,000. In 1SS8 Henry
T. Oxnard constructed at Grand Island,
Neb., the first beet sugar factory in the
United States. Mr. Oxnard is now pres
ident of both the American Beet Sugar
Company and the American Beet Sugar
Association, which represents all the
beet sugar factories In the United
States. He controls with his brothers
five sugar factories in the United
States.
It Is worthy of note, In the light of his
future undertakings, that one who
knew him then describes the outcome
of this first business as "a great finan
cial success, '

"smart" his latest novel could be un
reservedly praised. But this desire to
put into the mouths of characters epi
grams wholly Incompatible with their
several degrees of Intellect and to light
en the dull places in the plot by scin
tillating: aphorisms, bandied back and
forth with utterly Impossible swiftness,
takes away from the convincing power
of the writer's story. The depth and
seriousness in the plot loses by this
froth of cleverness.
The general atmesphere of HIch
ens' book is one distinctly of the de
cadent In modern society. - In drawing
his characters wholly from tha world
tired, open-eyed circle of the ultra
fashionable of London HIchens has
thrown his story Into a plane of life
that Is to most of us unpleasant In its
uglinessâ unpleasant but interesting.
The people who see all, know all, whose
sated tastes strike Inward to blunt the
soul and wither all delicacy of senti
ment and beauty of ideal â these are
the people whose every .breath exhales
a deadening materialism. The air they
breathe is heavy with superficiality,
thinly cloaking the bald animalism of
their hearts. It is into this Dead Sea
barren that HIchens conducts his
readers, revealing to them with ear
nestness and a seriousness of purpose
all the rank growth encumbering the
abnormal social fabric that rears it
self here.
About one woman of this unhealthy
social world the author draws all hia
plot lines. iVdy 'Viola Holme, a
peerless beauty and acknowledged
leader of the very smart London set,
is the typical woman of, the worldâ
of the social world, to be kind to her â
that moves through* HIchens' ' book | as
the personification f of all that Is life
among the decadent elite. . Following
a unique symbolical idea, whence
comes the title of the book, HIchens
seeks to show us this woman,' first as
she lives under ' the â¢ shell of worldll-

come her true self. As we see her
throughout the^major portion of the/
book, Lady Viola Holme is a magniflri
cent animal, such â¢ a 'woman asl
De Maupassant would, picture. She
holds the fealty of her British hus
band and commands the adoration of
other men by. physical attraction
alone. She knows her power, she
glories, in It, she recognizes no other
hold of woman over man save that of
the flesh. Then all Is changed. Swift
misfortune robs her of her beauty,
leaves her nothing but a grotesque
mask of ugliness, from which men
flee. All but one; he, cynic and rep
robate, scoffer at all Ideals, comes to
her In her wretchedness, seeking from,
her grace to live a clean life in the
love .of her true self, the woman of
native purity.
,' Though HIchens . attempts to mark
out strongly the point of cleavage be
tween Lady Holme the worldling," the
frankly animal, and Lady Holme re
generate,, so deeply lined is the char
acter of the woman who rules by the
flesh that when we think or perceive
in her the Inner purity and worth of
character It Is hard to .be quite j con
vinced of Its genuineness. After - her
beauty has been turned into shocking
. caricature and j it j becomes evident to
her that her power to inspire love
through sensuous appeal is gone, the
j Inner self which HIchens would have
us consider resident In his heroine
comes to the fore rather tardily. In
deed, convinced that the world has
nothing left for her, robbed of beauty.
Lady Holme is on the point of self
destruction, when the errant sot and
libertine; Rupert Carey, comes to her
to plead that she may lead him out of
the pit by her love. Rupert Carey is
quicker to see the shimmer of white
wings in the heroine than the reader.
Of the. score of other characters,
finely drawn and all seeming true to
life, Lord Holme, the arrant hedonist,
and Robin Pierce the Idealist, are es
pecially convincing. Were one to de
cide upon HIchens' chief merit as a
novelist it would be this very power
of producing a perfect character por
trait.

A N attempt to expose some of the
y J-X wrongs of the Washington Gov-
â¢*â¢ ernment service Is made in a
novel called "The Other Side of
the Story,"- by Leslie Dervllle.
The name is suggested by the current
opinion that a position in the civil ser
vice of Uncle Sam is a soft snap, and
this book purports to show the other
and the. seamy side of the supposed
semi-sinecure. '
The story tells mainly of the trials
of girls who "go into the Government
service at the capital, and incidentally
of the misfortunes of some and the
meannesses of other of the men who
work with or over the women of the
force. Where these are petty, though
provoking, a story may best serve to
assail them, but if some of the graver
charges are well founded the proofs
should be obtained ana me wrong ex
posed more boldly, definitely and with
accepted responsibility by the maker
of the serious charges. If these accu
sations are. not well founded the book
is a sort of literary fraud, seeking to
excite sympathy for tnose who are
either not so badly hurt as the tale
proclaims, or else not heroic enough to
strike the first blow for their own
grievances' redress.
The graver charge Is something more
than an Intimation that chief clerks
and heads of departments Bhow favor-
itism to women employes of the Gov-
ernment more because they are im-
properly complaisant than because
they are capable. So virtuous women
are "laboring for their oread side by
side and closely associated with the
mistresses of, certain statesmen and
pther officials of the Government,"
"winking their modest eyes" at this
state of affairs. Letters from home to
the struggling girls, implying poverty
of dear ones, show how they stick to
their slavery and stifle down their In-
dignatlon because Circumstances Is
master with a lash. Nor'Is this en-
forced affiliation all they are said to

After following the fortunes of the
Carolinas the reader, is led to the con
sideration of the share in the coloniza
tion of the North accomplished by
France. If the results of that work
are not seen to a general extent in the
institutions that prevail, the actual
contribution of France to the coloniza
tion, or at least the development, of
North America is very considerable.
Mr. Hamilton's story of the founding of
Louisiana, the establishing of French
government there, the extension of
French influence from the mouth of
the St. Lawrence, along the shores of
the Great Lakes, through the Illinois
country and down to the waters of the
Gulf of Mexico, is a tale of magnificent
enterprise and daring, almost match
less In interest and romance. Few men,
either from acquirements or predilec
tion, could so ably tell that story as
the author of the volume we are con
sidering. Beginning with a brief but
clear sketch of the conditions in France
that led to the colonizing policy of that
nation and sufficiently glancing at the
settling of Canada and the policy it
necessitated, the author follows in the
Eteps of Marquette and Joliet, De
Tonty and La Salle, Iberville and
Uienville, and the agents of Law's
great Mississippi enterprise. Then
the story of Louisiana under royal
governors Is given. The telling of all
this vast enterprise of the French dis
closes a wealth of thrilling adventure
and fascinating experience, and opens
up to' the reader a fund of unusual
information not often available and
much authoritative history hitherto un
published.
The author's further consideration of
the opening of the Illinois and Ohio
River countries, the change of owner
ship of the Floridas and Louisiana, the
settlements of the Germans and the
Scotch-Irish, gives clearly and suc
cinctly the facts of history, clothed
with all the romance that comes of the
clash of the pioneer traders, the In
trigues and counter intrigues of the
opposing nationalities in their rela
tions with the Indians and the early
struggle of the settlers. ''

The story of the company discloses
the causes of the conflict between the

recounting the overthrow of the former

the colony.. The political factors lead
ing to the end of the company's term

these the author traces, as well as the
more immediate causes of the termina

Of all uur colonial history, that of
the upbuilding of the southern part of *
the r.a.tion has in it the greatest ro
mance. There the clash of nations
brought into play the actions of the
chivalrous cavalier, the youd, boast
ful Spaniard, the courtly. Insinuating
CJaul. the patient and persevering
Swiss, the unswerving and tenacious
Scotch-Irish and the stolid and Indus
trious German. All of these peoples,
thrown into the strange conditions of
a new world, worked out their desti
nies la ways that were full of the spice
erf pure romance. It is the recognition
of this and the emphasis laid by the
author upon this element of the his
tory of southern colonization that
makes his bo-oks eminently readable.
The author begins by briefly review- '
ins the genesis of the spirit of western '
colonization and the motives that in
ppired the Spaniards to seek a footing
on the American continent; he sum- ;
jnarizes the results of the enterprises ;
undertaken by the earliest explorers,
through whom Florida became some- '
thing more than a dream and conquest ]
and colonization a definite policy of
the Spanish monarchy, with the result
that Tristan de Luna was made Cap
tain General of Florida. The story of '
this adventurer's exploration of the
new territory is told, as well as the
abandonment of the enterprise, which
however, was not fruitless, for some
knowledge of the country, the people,
of some ports and bays of the gulf,
was gained, and a still more important
result* effected by the taking posses
sion of the Carolina coast. The author
then brings us to that extremely inter
esting historic point v.hen France was
to wrestle with Spain for the Southern
possessions, and he traces in vivid out
line the colonization enterprise of the
famous Menendez, who appeared . on
the coast of Florida in 1565 only to
find Huguenots settled at Fort Caro
lina on the St. Johns River. We are
told of something more than the well
known attack on the French colony;
we learn of the exploration made by
Menendez and of the various settle
ments effected by him, among others
that of Helenaâ Port RoyaL The clos
ing pages of this Eubject present us
with a clear understanding of the rela
tions between the Spaniards and the
Indians, and give us an account of
the practical side of the Spanish under
taking in the description of the forts
and of the administrative measures
adopted by Menendez to place the
Spanish settlement on a Eolid basis.
In the same way are presented the
causes and conditions attending the
settlement of French Florida. The
Btory, of course, turns on the ill-fated
expedition of Jean Ribault, who ar
rived with his Huguenot colony on
the river May (St. Johns) in 1562. and
after taking possession for France
railed northward to Port Royal, where
he established his settlement of "gen
tlemen, soldiers, and mariners," men
who we learn from the description be
fore us were 111 fitted to found a colony
In the land of promise they had
reached. We have also a vivid tracing
of thj expedition led by Laudonnlere
which was to supplement the colony
taken out by Ribault; of their arrival
in the May and their building Fort
Carolina; cf tbe.lr lack of thrift and
foresight, and their distress; of their
Euccor by Sir John Hawkins, and,
finally, of the arrival of Ribault, who
had returned to France after making
a settlement at Port Royal.
In the story of the bitter struggles of
the Spaniards and French that ended
in the slaughter of the French colony,
Mr. Hamilton has found a way of tell
ing a well known story which gives
added confidence to the reader. We
confess we can never read of the in
fSmous Incident without bitterness; we
believe In the charge of savagery which
is generally credited to Menendez; his
treacherous conduct we have ever re
garded aa a black spot on Spanish his
tory. The present author manifests his
deliberate and judicial temperament in
discussing this harrowing episode,
while not In any way minimizing the
horrors of the circumstances; and It
may well be that historians have not
given due regard to the motive that
prompted Meh?ndez in the execution
of his eavage act. But revenge could
not be long stayed, and as an offset to
the Spanish cruelty we have the ac
count of De Gourgues' expedition to
Florida and of his destruction of the
Spanish settlement which had replaced
that of his countrymen. With a re
view of the Huguenots In France and
the influence of the Spanish massacre
in Florida on the future colonization
of America the subject doses.
Next are told the various incidental
causes that led to the exploitation of
Virginia under the charter granted to
Gates, Somers and others. The history
of the Virginia Company Is told In Its
expeditions and settlements, the admin
istration of affairs and the exploration
of the colony by Captain John Smith;
the extension of the colony, the life of

]eap â, great. There was no peril in
the chOppy sea over which the boat
was now pushing; the peril was In tho
breakers. Watchfulness could evade
it, but with every boat's length of
progress Jo was plunged In deeper
wonder. He was evolving a new theory
of the tide, which was a subtle dis
traction. Was the spell of this mys
tery to undo him? Thus Jo, as for
Ezeklel, he was afraid of the mon
aters he had conjured up in tho mist,
so âas his people invariably do in
dread and danger âhe turned to his
religion for consolation. He thought
deeply of hell.,
"Is you been good the day, b'y?"
Ezekiel asked dreamily,
"Noa," Jo answered. Indifferently,
"I 'low I hasn't spread me caplin quite
âquite straight."
The wind was stirring Itself In tho
north. The dusk was thick and clam
my. The sound of the surf had risen
to a deep, harsh growl,
"Be you 'feared o* hell?"
"Noa," said Jo. "Lads doan't goa t*
ll."
It was a new riddle in Ragged Har
bor. "Who guve it you, b'y?" Ezekiel
cried.
"Granny Sevior," said Jo. "Iss, sure;
when I took her some trouts. She do
say she heered un when she were a
maid. 'Tis a brook bubblin'."
Ezeklel marveled. .
From the body of fog that lurked be
hind Mad Mull, there dammed in its
course from the north, a thick, gray
mass overflowed and. settled to the sur
face of the sea. A cloud, high lying, at
tenuated, Impenetrable; rounded the
point and crept seaward with the de
viated current, of the wind, its outmost
parts swerving to the south, advancing
slowly. Implacably.
"They be nar a hill t' the say, b'y,".
Ezekiel said, impatiently. He glanced
apprehensively shoreward.
It had come to Jo that the abode of
the tide was hidden of designâ an In
finite, terrible mystery- - In the con-;
sclousness of presumption he quaked;
but he gripped the scull oar tighter and
held, the boat on her course for the sun.'
"They be nar a hill 'tween here an*
the sun," Ezeklel plainted.
They were' sailing, over tha Grappling
Hook grounds, and as far as sight car
ried the graying sea was fiat.
"Us'll goa hoamo now, ' Jo," Ezekiel
sheet and scanned the sea ahead. The
sea was flat; there was no hill to be
seen. He sighed, and said in a dis
tracted way:
As I Trent up t" London Brldg*
I met ma brother Jan;
I cut ofC his bead an' sucked his blood.
An' let his body stan'.
"Jewberry,". said Ezeklel, with lack of
interest.
"Uh-huh," said Jo. Then, bethinking
himself, "Oh!"
As I went up t' London Bride*
I taw a mighty wonder.
Twenty pots a-bllin'.
An' no flre under.
pleaded. " 'Twill be barbarous hard t'
find the goaats in the dark."
"They, do be a hill further out," said
Jo. "Keep a lookout, b'y."
A rift In the clouds disclosed the sun
as it sankâ as it went out like a candle
in a sudden draft. The arm of fog
closed in on the boat; the shoreward
cloud crept past the harbor and reach
ed for Gull's Nest Point, a mile to thÂ©
south, the last distinguishable land
mark. The boys were silent for a long
time. Ezeklel watched a whale at play
to leeward; he wondered concerning
his fate if it should mistake the punt
for its young, as had happened to Uncle
Sammy Arnold long ago, when there
were, more whales and they were
bigger, much bigger, as Uncle Sammy
had said. Jo was sunk in the bitter
ness of realizing failure; he sawnoth
ing but a surface of water that was
flatâ flat as the splitting table.
<M Tis'past the turn o* the tide," said;
Jo at last, like a man giving up hope.
"Iss, sure!" said Ezekiel, blithely.
"Us'll come about."
"'.'Us'll come about," said Jo. â¢
The theory had failed. ", Jo headed thjSj
boat for shore. . He shaped the course
by Gull's Nest Point, measuring thÂ©
shore" fronv its fading : outline to the
probable : location: of the harbor; , then i,

"I'low," Ezekieisaid with some def-7
erence, "he've a hoale t* go to.'*

"I 'low he do," Ezeklel persisted with
deepening, politeness.

"I 'low he heaps hisself up; an' 'twill
be like cllmbln' a hill t' paddle f the

"Iss, b'y?" Ezeklel was patiently
sure of Jo's wisdom.
"The tideâ he do."
"They be nar a hill f tha say," Eze
klel cried with scorn.
"You be oan'y a lad," Jo persisted.
"I 'low heaps hisself up."
"Where do he?"
"T'other side o* the Grapplln' Hook
grounds, where he've no bottom."
" .'Tis barbarous far." Ezekiel regret
fully glanced at the little schooner he
had made. He had Just rigged the Jib
Â¦with pains; he wanted to try the craft
out in the light wind.
" 'Tis not so far as the sun's hoals."
"Huh! . 'Tis not so handy as Tailor's
Nose." T;
Jo stirred himself. "Be your caplin
spread, b'y?"
"Iss."
"Be un all spread, b'y?"
"Iss," plaintively.
"Us'll goa. Cast off!"
Ezekiel hesitated. *Be your caplin
spread?" he demanded. Then, stern as
a prophet, "God'll damn yo t' everlast
in' fire 'n you lie."
"You be cursin' God, Ezekiel Sevior!"
Jo exclaimed. "God'll damn you. 'Tis
marked down this minute â Iss, sure."
.With impatience, "Us'll goa. Cast off!"
Ezeklel loosed the painter and sprang
to the rowing seat, and Jo bent his
strength to the scull oar and sent the
punt clear of a Jutting rock. Now, in
these parts the tide has a clutch; the
Â¦water gripped the boat and drew her
out â swift and sly as a thief's hsthd.
Soon the grip was fast; had the young
strengthâ that now spent itself in
guiding to escape wreck on the Pan
cake â been turned to flat resistance, It
would have wasted itself in vain. But
to the children's sight the sea was fair
âso they were swept on, singing:
"Lookit!" Ezekiel exclaimed, point-
Ing to the shore. He was scared to a
whisper.
"'Tis Bob," Jo said. "Hark!'.*
Bob, a frowsy old dog with the name
of a fish thief, was in the shadow of a
flake, howling madly and pawing the
shingle.
" 'Tis the sign o* death!" Jo gripped
the gunwale. -
The dog howled for the third time;
then he slunk off down tha road with
his clog between his legs.
"Josiah Butts â 'tis he, surel" Ezekiel
exclaimed.
"Noa; 'tisâ"
"Iss; 'tis Josiah. He've handy to
five yards too much t" the spread o' his
malns'L" â
""â¢Tis Uncle Job Luff, b'y," Jo said,
knowingly. "I heered un curse God last
even."
Ezeklel started. "What dld.un say,
b'y?" he insinuated.
"I heered un say â " Jo came to a
full stop, v "Hugh!" he went on cun
ningly. "Think o' all the cursin' you
ever heered." ;
"Noa!" Ezekiel said, quickly. "Sure
'tis a sin t* think & cursih'." .
Jo grinned. Then, sadly, he said:
" 'Tis Uncle Job â Iss, sure. Poor Aunt
'Melia Ann!"
Ezeklel mused. "I 'low 'tls Uncle
Job," he agreed at last. "He've a rot
ten paddle to his punt."
Jo spread the sail, stretched himself
in the stern, with his feet on the gun
wales and a lazy hand on the scull
oar, and began to sing.
The sun was dropping swiftly, puff
ing himself up in his precipitate de
scent to the" ragged black clouds that
were mounting the sky, taking on a
deepening, glowing crimson, the color
of flame in dense smoke. The woolly
clouds in the east were flushed pink,
mottled like a salmon's bellyâ a borrow
ed glory that, anon, . fled, leaving a
melancholy tint behind. Soon the whole
heaven, from the crest of the black
hills, far in the unknown inland, to the
black horizon in the mysterious ex
panse beyond the Grappling Hook fish
ing grounds, was aglow; splashes of
pink and gray and blue, thin streaks
of pale green, heaps of smoky black
and of gold, glowing, and of purple and
violets and fiery red. The coast, high
and rugged, with a low line of frothy
white, and a crest of stunted spruce
sloping to the edge of the precipice was
changed from dull green and duller
gray to blood-red and purple and
black; but this glorious mantle was
soon lifted. In the white line there was
one black space, the harbor mouth,
whence the tickle led to the basin; and
that space was like a rat hole. On
either side, from the tip of Mad Mull
to the limit of vision In the south, tho
coast rocks were like a wall, sheer,
massive, scowling, with here and there,
at the base, great shattered masses,
over which the sea frothed. The boat
was headed for the sun; it was slipping
over a gentle lop in a light wind. Â¦
"Rede me a riddle," said Ezeklel.
The demand â¢ startled Jo. The great
descending * night oppressed him; and
he had been thinking of the tide, now
a cold, frowning mystery. He eased tho
"Hut, b'y!" said Uncle Sammy.
"They be a hape o' curious things
about the say. Sheer off from they.
Iss, sure. The tide do goa in a hoale
in the bottom."
Jo had abandoned that theory months
ago; and so he puzzled, until, one day,
when he and Ezekiel idled together,
the punt slipped, at the turn of the
tide, from under the laden flake, where
the shadows are deep and cold, into
the fading sunshine of the open harbor.
Her shadow wriggled to the dull, green
depths where the starfish and sea eggs
lay; and the wary dories darted, flash
ing, into the security of the black
waters beyond. She tugged at her
painter like a dog at the leash â swing
ing fretfully, reaching, clacking with
a petulant ripple; it was as though she
panted to Join the waters In the race
through the tickle to the wide, free
open. Now, the sea was here restrained
from treacherous violence by encircling
rocks; so, with rocking and ripple and
amorous glitter, Jo was lured to a con
templation of the mystery that lay be
yond the placid harbor.
"Now, b'y,** Jo Bald, abruptly, "I
knows!'*
"Iss. b'y?" little Ezekiel answered
from the bow. '
"Iss?" said Jo. doubtfully. It was
past his understanding, so he crept to
the edge of the cliff to watch the black
waves roll ponderously out of the mist
and Ehatter and froth over the lower
rocks.
"Tha cay do be hungry for lives this
even." Uncle Sammy sighed.
"For me?" the boy screamed. "Iss
xinT' He shrank from the abyss, quiv
ering. : /::!
"He do be hungry this day."
Jo strode forward, as In wrath; then
bolfily he faced the sea, bearding It
It with clinched hands and dilated nos
trils.
â¢"Tis good for un," Uncle Sammy
laughed.
"The say woan't cotch me!" the boy
cried. "I woan't let un cotch me!"
"He've not cotched me," Sammy said,
eerenely. He peered seaward; and for
him it was as though the mist were the
dust of patt years.
"I woan't let un cotch me!" the boy
cried again. He stumbled, in blind
fright, to Uncle Sammy, and took his'
hand. "I woan't!" he sobbed. "I
â¢woan't. â¢ â¢ â¢ I woan't!"
It was the Mystery! ' "Skipper Jo,
b'y," the old man whispered, "you be
one o' they poor folk that can't 'bide
the say. Little Skipper." he said,
crooking his arm about the lad's waist,
"never care. Iss, sure â you be one o'
they the say cotches â like your faw
therâIss, sure."
Thereafter Jo knew the eea for his
enemy.
Thence, to his tenth year, when all
things were suddenly revealed, he won
dered concerning many things; and
chief among his perplexities was this:
V.'here did the tide go? Where did the
waters bide until they ran back
through the tickle to cover again the
slimy harbor bottom?
"Hut, b'y." the old man cried in a
rage. "They be moare quintals f my
name on Manuel's books 'n they be
â 'n they be â folk in theâ the
warlfl!"
They were on Lookout Head, waiting
for the fleet to beat in from a thicken
ing night; from this vantage Uncle
Sammy swept his staff over the land,
north to south, to comprehend the
whole world.
"I Mow," the child pursued stead-
IJy, *'I cotches moare'n you done. Un
cle Sammy."
THE enviable achievement In his
eight was a gunwale load
matched from a loppy sea; he
had never heard of a pirate or a
clown or a motorznan. From
the beginning he was committed to
the tell of the sea, for he was a New
foundlander of the upper shore â the
child of a gray, solemn waste place;
a land of artificial graveyards. The
lean rocks to which the cottages of
Ragged Harbor cling like barnacles
Me. a thin. Jagged strip, between a
wilderness of scrawny shrubs and the
sea's fretful expanse. It chanced that
Joe was the Issue of a springtime ar
rangement â such as the gulls make â
which, happily, had endured to the
coming of a parson of passage four
years later. He had been brought forth
like the young of the seal and the
white bear, and he was nurtured into
hardy childhood â Into brown, lithe,
quick strength â no more for love
than for the labor of his hands. Ob
viously, then, he was committed to
the toll of the sea.
This was disclosed to him â this
and the sea's enmity â while he was
still in a pinafore of hard-tack sack
ing, months distant from his heritage
of old homespun clothes.
"I 'low I cotches mor fish 'n Job
Luff when I grows up," he boasted
to Sammy Arnold, who had fished out
of Ragged Harbor for sixty years, and
was then past his labor. "I 'low I
salts un better, too."
Sammy chuckled.
Ezeklel had forgotten his God. Ha
cried for his mother, who was real and
nearer. God had been to him. Ilka a
frowning shape In tha mist.
How shall we Interpret? Where Is the
poet who shall now sing the sea's song
of triumph? Who shall ascribe glory
to her for this deed? Thus, In truth,
she bears herself in the dark corners
of the earth. These children had fol
lowed the lure of her mystery, which
is, to the peopte of bleak coasts, like
the variable light In fal3e eyes, like
a fair finger beckoning. It was aa
though the sea had smiled at their
coming, and had said to the ml3t and
the wind, "Gather them in." If there
be glory to the sea. It was glory of
hidden mercy; Indeed,. Isolation and
toll are things to escape..

"I knows â Iss, sura," said he.
"Where tha tickle be? Does you?**
"Where the tide goas."
"Where do un goa?" Ezeklel asked
In mournful disappointment.
Jo pointed to the wash In tha bottom
of the boat as it slipped from stem to
stern with the risen lop. Now tha
waters covered the boy's feet and
gurgled and hissed under tha stern
seat; now they swirled to Ezeklel's
boots, sweeping along a chip and a

" "Tls like the tideâ 'tis Ilk* uns." Jo
whispered. . .

The breakers seemed very near. Jo

THE girl with a box of colors reigns
queen of the summer, for It Is the
season of the hand-painted girl.
She who can paint well has at her
finger tips the means of making herself
wonderfully smart, while she who
paints a little can still manage to paint
just enough to be in fashion.
Never have hand-painted fabrics been
60 much tho vesue. There are hand
painted articles of all kinds, from the
tiny fans to the flaring parasols, anJl
there are haml-ralnted fabrics of every
weight, from the hand-painted broad
cloth gown to the light hand-painted
mull.
'. . : - Â¦Â¦Â¦Â¦
To paint a dress fabric well is no
easy task, but the girl of the summer
EToes at It with good American pluck,
and for her It may be said that she
succeeds remarkably well, for, with true
American talent, she chooses her colors
properly and carries them out artis
tically.
There are hand-r>ainted gowns, de
licious hand-painted chiffons, exquisite
laces with hand-painted touch, gorge
ous Batins and lightweight velvets
which are fine enough to be classed as
works of art â and all hand decorated.
Indeed, no less an artist than Sargent
himself was asked to paint a lace
flounce for a leader of American fash-
Ion. He declined, but laughingly de
clared that it was a great temptation
to him.
There are lovely lace flounces of little
Intrinsic value because done by the
hand cf the amateur at home, but
awfully pretty just the same! There is
something so light and feminine about
the colors as they are laid upon the
fabrics that one cannot help being
tempted by them, even though one
knows that they are delicate and not to
be worn more than one season, or two
at the most.
The American girl, who is usually of
economic mind and of durable intent,
has fallen first victim to the hand
painted craze. Its prettiness was too
much for her. She was captivated by
the colors,* and before the fad had be
come full grown across the waters,
where It started, ehe was one of Its
willing admirers at home.
And why not? The hand-painted girl
Is a new girl; she is a pretty girl; her
gowns look feminine, and they are not
necessarily dear, bo why should she not
long to be hand-painted?
The First Painted Gown.
The first oil-painted gown of the sea
son came from Paris. Here, under the
watchful eye of the best, modiste In
France, it grew. Gradually it developed
from a poor little insignificant dress
Into one with all Its straight breadths
done in roses and . with Its yoke and
cuffs all trailing with the same blos
soms and flowers.
It was a gown of chiffon broadcloth
and was designed for a wedding. The
mother of the '--'d?. wishing her to
wear something new and lovely, bar-
tered a small fortune to secure a gown
which Bhould be absolutely noveL It
was a decided success and Its color, a
delicious shade of burnt cream, was
most charmingly brought out with its
garlands and branches of garden roses.
While there is a tendency toward the
wild flower decorations it must be ad
mitted that the American girl has
twice the fondness, for the product of
the hothouse. She likes the rose, but it
is not necessarily the wild rose. She
paints the orchid, not the orchid of the
jungle, but the orchid of the conser
vatory- She paints the violet, but It is
the heavy violet of cultivation, not the
little soft violet of the wildwoods.
These things are Important to know,
for they mark the boundary between
style and no style at all; they show
the difference between the professional
and the amateur.
In Newport there Is a smart set. This
Is the set whose leaders are million
aires and whose debutantes are the
catches of the season. In this set there
is one girl who is a band-painted girl;

This : gown, which was made < with
the plain round skirt. Just escaping the
floor, was .trimmed W around* -, the V toot
with two wide ruffles,' -^ These", ruffles
were ' twelve inches\ deep :' and were
ehirred around the f pot of the ( skirt

there was a band of deep green? taffeta

She"; will need Â¦ a hand-painted sash,

the girl who blushes not deeper than
the poppies with which her parasol is
painted, arid she wears roses that are a
blood red, not the faint, delicate pink
roses of the old-fashioned sort. When
you paint use the brighter tones rather
than the faded, dull tints." So declared,
the artistic French woman.
And there is another rule which the
hand-painted girl would do well to ob
serve. Choose your flower and stick to
it If you select the wisteria vine,
which is an effective pattern If done
upon India lawn, let all your decora
tions be cf wisteria. Do not try to mix
up the flowers.
"Do I like the hand painted idea?"
said an American dressmaker. "Yes,
immensely for the summer girl. It is
a novelty, cheap and pretty." So why
should it not â¢ be the most popular
thing of the year?
'' "As for me, I specially like the
hand painted blouses of plain silk. I
buy them to fit my customers, all
ready made, and then I send them to
the studio to be painted." And throw
ing open a door, this modiste revealed
a. row of young women, all busily
painting silk shirt waists. It looked
more like the studio of an artist than
a room in a dressmaking establish
ment. But it is an innovation to which
we of fashion's world must lovingly
The Colors of the Summer.
The select colors this season are the
vegetable colors. They are onion
green, asparagus green, pea green, let
tuce green and watercress green. Then
in the reds one notes watermelon pink,
'which is very red; beet red, radish red
and carrot red..
In the yellows there Is a very smart
squash colored cloth, and there are
flower yellows galore, buttercup, yel
low rose, daffodil yellow and the yel
low of the cowslips.
It Is strange how many new tones
one can find and. how readily they can
be recognized at a glance. The new
burnt cream tone is quite different
from the creamy tint, and there is
flesh color, which differs from both.
It Is a good thing for the woman of
the season to accustom herself to the
new tints, for she may be able to get
something specially smart by paying'
attention to the Innovations in the
color line.
The woman who clings by prefer
ence to the old shades should be sure
to select tones that hold their style,
for there is nothing funnier, from a
fashionable standpoint, than a gown
that is made up In a color that Is not
popular now. Don't try to be a suc
cessful dresser in old colors and
mediocre fabrics. It cannot be done.
Parrot and onion green are the lat^'
est in Dame Fashion's world to t IS
popularity for themselves, and to be
gowned in these, with trimmings of
a deeper shade or with contrasting
trimmings of coral or tomato, is to be
very smartly.costumed. Indeed.
Girlish Garments Are Worn.
All women want to look younger this
year and here are a few little frills of
fashion which add to one's youthful
appearance. If you want to look girl
ish around the belt you must put on
one of the girdles of crushed satin. Let
the girdle for afternoon or evening be
of pink. Let It be very wide and very
soft and very thin, but decidedly lus
trous. Do not furnish it with sash
ends, but let it be completed with two
rosettes at the back. These can be of
medium size and should be put on
two inches apart, to make the waist
look small and trim. If far apart, these
rosettes have a tendency to make the
belt look too wide.
And there is another way to look
youthful, and this Is to trim with little
ruffles and with frills. Let there be
flounces and tucks, and let each be
edged with a narrow ruffle of lace,
preferably of Valenciennes. There is
gown. And, with the slippers, there
must go a pair of hand-painted stock*
ings. And such stockings â all cuplds
and angels and flying streamers of
ribbon., .
y -The ; fan is a necessity, and its . only
rule is, that it shall be tiny, while the
sticks, : the ) covering jl and they- ribbon
streamers ; that fly from it may all^ be
painted., v . \ â¢ , .
' And you will want a painted straw
hat. This Is the easiest- of all to ob
tain,. for, any. girl with a spark of inge
nuity arid a: paint brush' can take her
old white chip and tint it^; while if it
be a handsome straw, of the expensive
sort she can put a few touches upon it
to bring out the beauty of the straw
and furnish the hand-painted note.
. Iiitjle 1 Additional Touches.
In addition to these things the ambi
tious girl can, at small, expense, paint
herself a stock, a girdle, an adjustable
lace yoke for the neck and another one
for the skirt, and she can have all the
parasols she wants. When it comes to
i lace fichus and flchus of mull and to a
matter of hand-painted lace and hand
painted pocket handkerchiefs of white
silk to tuck in the front of the gown,
she can mabe them for herself. And
she can have sashes and neck chous
with painted ends and wonderful scarfs
for the hat which, give it a very dressy
note. .
The fad of the hand-painted girl,
while an elegant one, is not necessarily
a costly one; for, like many another
passing vogue, it depends more upon
willingness and ingenuity and personal
taste than upon actual dollars and
cents.
"One rule," says a French dress
maker, "must be observed! Don't at
tempt to carry out the colors in pastel
tones. This is old fashioned. The up
to-date hand-painted girl is vivid with
lilacs in their purplest tones. She is
gorgeous in wistaria blue as a plum and
ripe with deepest green foliage. She is
.no yoke that Is Quite bo youthful as
the one that is trimmed with narrow
lace frills. And there is no skirt so
girlishly dressy as the one that Is aec
orated with lace ruffles or with muslin
flounces. Don't forget this in making
your summer gowns. .
And remember that there are several
kinds of Val. lace. There Is dainty
French Valenciennes which Is as
dressy as any other lace of aristocratic
lineage. There is the heavy German
Valenciennes lace. And there Is the
expensive Valenciennes of the Italian
school, with its outstanding pattern.
Tou can get It good enough for frill
ing for from 8 cents downward. And.
really, there Is no lace more popular
for all fabrics.
She who wants to be very youthful
must not wear silk, but fine linen,
though It Is doubtful If there are many
who will feel able to afford this luxury.
A Fifth avenue Importer of foreign
linens. India. French and Oriental
kinds, displays small patterns Just
enough for linen shirt waists. They
are all hand embroidered and are un
made. They are selling for $35 a pat
tern and there are others at $50.
The secret of it is that they look like
thread lace and there are certain pat
terns that are the very image of point
lace. So that for $50 a woman secures
a bodice which is made of point lace or
which looks so much like point that you
cannot tell the difference.
Wide Collars and Other Frills.
A summer feature is the wide collar.
It is made of various materials, one of
the prettiest being of white taffeta. It
has black polka dots applied. Theso
dots are of black silk upon the back
ground of white silk. Around the edge
there is a piping of black silk. and.
underlying the collar, there are points
of salmon pink taffeta. Each point is
trimmed with a lace medallion. Such a
collar dresses up any evening blouse
wonderfully. Worn over black or white
it really makes the whole dress, for it
gives the note which was lacking.
It is the, wide sailor collar effect which
Is liked by those who admire fine dress-
Ing. It lengthens the shoulder, trims
the neck, and, with a pair of cuffs to
match. It makes the gown.
With the large sailor collar laid on
flat one sees the neckless or stockless
gown. Frequently the neck has no
other finish than this wide, flat collar.
And this brings one to a consideration
of the velvet throat band. This is be
ing much worn. It Is wide and is
crossed in the front and fastened with,
a cameo pin. The style is not a new
one and any grandmother of the pres
ent day will tell you how it was worn In
her girlhood.
The band Is sometimes put on plain
and crossed In the back or finished at
the back of the neck with a tulle chou.
In the front there dangles a locket.
The revival of the velvet neck band
is one of the prettiest of the summer
styles and the woman who does not
include a set of these bands of vary
ing widths, and wrist bands to match,
misses one of her prettiest opportuni
ties.
And the best point in these neck
and wrist bands must not ba forgot
ten. They afford the touch of black.
The touch of black is necessary to
everything and no black Is as desir
able as black velvet. Little black vel
vet choux are admirable with every
gown and black velvet pipings and
pipings of chiffon velvet are found
upon the most expensive of foreign
importations.
There are other freaks of fashion.
And one of these is the frayed silk
ruffle looking precisely like a flower.
Take silk and make a ruffle of it.
Fray it upon the edge, using a dull
knife if you have no fraying machine.
Make the ruffle full and you have a
charming trimming. One of these ruf-

cream eilk fan mounted on white
enamel, with no decorations of. any
kind. Then she bought a large cream
colored parasol, also perfectly plain. To
this she added a white cream silk so

finally, she purchased enough cream

ence to the old shades should be sure
to select tones that hold their style,
for there is nothing funnier, from a
fashionable standpoint, than a gown
that is made up In a color that Is not
popular now. Don't try to be a suc
cessful dresser in old colors and
mediocre fabrics. It cannot be done.
Parrot and onion green are the lat^'
est in Dame Fashion's world to t IS
popularity for themselves, and to be
gowned in these, with trimmings of
a deeper shade or with contrasting
trimmings of coral or tomato, is to be
very smartly.costumed. Indeed.
Girlish Garments Are Worn.
All women want to look younger this
year and here are a few little frills of
fashion which add to one's youthful
appearance. If you want to look girl
ish around the belt you must put on
one of the girdles of crushed satin. Let
the girdle for afternoon or evening be
of pink. Let It be very wide and very
soft and very thin, but decidedly lus
trous. Do not furnish it with sash
ends, but let it be completed with two
rosettes at the back. These can be of
medium size and should be put on
two inches apart, to make the waist
look small and trim. If far apart, these
rosettes have a tendency to make the
belt look too wide.
And there is another way to look
youthful, and this Is to trim with little
ruffles and with frills. Let there be
flounces and tucks, and let each be
edged with a narrow ruffle of lace,
preferably of Valenciennes. There is
gown. And, with the slippers, there
must go a pair of hand-painted stock*
ings. And such stockings â all cuplds
and angels and flying streamers of
ribbon., .
y -The ; fan is a necessity, and its . only
rule is, that it shall be tiny, while the
sticks, : the ) covering jl and they- ribbon
streamers ; that fly from it may all^ be
painted., v . \ â¢ , .
' And you will want a painted straw
hat. This Is the easiest- of all to ob
tain,. for, any. girl with a spark of inge
nuity arid a: paint brush' can take her
old white chip and tint it^; while if it
be a handsome straw, of the expensive
sort she can put a few touches upon it
to bring out the beauty of the straw
and furnish the hand-painted note.
. Iiitjle 1 Additional Touches.
In addition to these things the ambi
tious girl can, at small, expense, paint
herself a stock, a girdle, an adjustable
lace yoke for the neck and another one
for the skirt, and she can have all the
parasols she wants. When it comes to
i lace fichus and flchus of mull and to a
matter of hand-painted lace and hand
painted pocket handkerchiefs of white
silk to tuck in the front of the gown,
she can mabe them for herself. And
she can have sashes and neck chous
with painted ends and wonderful scarfs
for the hat which, give it a very dressy
note. .
The fad of the hand-painted girl,
while an elegant one, is not necessarily
a costly one; for, like many another
passing vogue, it depends more upon
willingness and ingenuity and personal
taste than upon actual dollars and
cents.
"One rule," says a French dress
maker, "must be observed! Don't at
tempt to carry out the colors in pastel
tones. This is old fashioned. The up
to-date hand-painted girl is vivid with
lilacs in their purplest tones. She is
gorgeous in wistaria blue as a plum and
ripe with deepest green foliage. She is
.no yoke that Is Quite bo youthful as
the one that is trimmed with narrow
lace frills. And there is no skirt so
girlishly dressy as the one that Is aec
orated with lace ruffles or with muslin
flounces. Don't forget this in making
your summer gowns. .
And remember that there are several
kinds of Val. lace. There Is dainty
French Valenciennes which Is as
dressy as any other lace of aristocratic
lineage. There is the heavy German
Valenciennes lace. And there Is the
expensive Valenciennes of the Italian
school, with its outstanding pattern.
Tou can get It good enough for frill
ing for from 8 cents downward. And.
really, there Is no lace more popular
for all fabrics.
She who wants to be very youthful
must not wear silk, but fine linen,
though It Is doubtful If there are many
who will feel able to afford this luxury.
A Fifth avenue Importer of foreign
linens. India. French and Oriental
kinds, displays small patterns Just
enough for linen shirt waists. They
are all hand embroidered and are un
made. They are selling for $35 a pat
tern and there are others at $50.
The secret of it is that they look like
thread lace and there are certain pat
terns that are the very image of point
lace. So that for $50 a woman secures
a bodice which is made of point lace or
which looks so much like point that you
cannot tell the difference.
Wide Collars and Other Frills.
A summer feature is the wide collar.
It is made of various materials, one of
the prettiest being of white taffeta. It
has black polka dots applied. Theso
dots are of black silk upon the back
ground of white silk. Around the edge
there is a piping of black silk. and.
underlying the collar, there are points
of salmon pink taffeta. Each point is
trimmed with a lace medallion. Such a
collar dresses up any evening blouse
wonderfully. Worn over black or white
it really makes the whole dress, for it
gives the note which was lacking.
It is the, wide sailor collar effect which
Is liked by those who admire fine dress-
Ing. It lengthens the shoulder, trims
the neck, and, with a pair of cuffs to
match. It makes the gown.
With the large sailor collar laid on
flat one sees the neckless or stockless
gown. Frequently the neck has no
other finish than this wide, flat collar.
And this brings one to a consideration
of the velvet throat band. This is be
ing much worn. It Is wide and is
crossed in the front and fastened with,
a cameo pin. The style is not a new
one and any grandmother of the pres
ent day will tell you how it was worn In
her girlhood.
The band Is sometimes put on plain
and crossed In the back or finished at
the back of the neck with a tulle chou.
In the front there dangles a locket.
The revival of the velvet neck band
is one of the prettiest of the summer
styles and the woman who does not
include a set of these bands of vary
ing widths, and wrist bands to match,
misses one of her prettiest opportuni
ties.
And the best point in these neck
and wrist bands must not ba forgot
ten. They afford the touch of black.
The touch of black is necessary to
everything and no black Is as desir
able as black velvet. Little black vel
vet choux are admirable with every
gown and black velvet pipings and
pipings of chiffon velvet are found
upon the most expensive of foreign
importations.
There are other freaks of fashion.
And one of these is the frayed silk
ruffle looking precisely like a flower.
Take silk and make a ruffle of it.
Fray it upon the edge, using a dull
knife if you have no fraying machine.
Make the ruffle full and you have a
charming trimming. One of these ruf-

knack of looking sympathetic when
poor hubby's gout has tha toothacha

his will in her favor.
Of course, a beautiful woman Is love
ly to look upon, but the natural one,
who laughs like a child, loves Ilka a
woman and sympathizes like an angel,
is the one whose love is a dream,
whose life Is a poem and whose death
is a tragedy.
It Is often the saving grace of tha rtry.
homely one.
We have an seen women who w*ra
so uncomely that we pitied them, but
who when they laughed tha whola
face beamed and tha laugh rippled
charmingly. Such a woman Is the
"darling of the gods" and nappy Is
the man who wins her.
A very funny set of pictures Illus
trative of the Saint Cecelia gaze wera
recently taken of a very homely but
very rich society girl of New York,
who imagined that her* craze for Pade
rewski and music, art and Greek drap
eries etherealized her. But, unfortu
nately, she was not built that way.
You can never make a beer stein look
like a peach blow vase. Her face was
cf the good-natured, round type, more
suggestive of sensuality than of estheti
cism. When she wobbled her eyes a la
Saint Cecelia she looked Idiotic; but
when a woman goes "bughouse," as the
boys say, on art nothing less than a
strait jacket will drive out the buzzing.
The Madonna face is born, not made.
It is very beautiful, looks very pure,
but in the records of those figuring
in the most disgraceful escapades you
will find the Madonna face pre-eminent.
It is a deceptive and deceiving face,
the face of an angel and the heart of
a fiend, and you will rarely find the
woman with such a face as Innocent
as she looks. She Is never true, and
the wives who desecrate homes and
drag honor into the mire are more fre
quently of this type.
The beautiful face is often the mask
of selfishness and ignorance. The girl
who is told every day and hour that
she is beautiful learns to regard beauty
as the open sesame to any and every
court. She does not feel the need of
such strenuous efforts to cultivate her
self as does the girl whose attractive
personality proves an Incentive to
greater endeavor to please. â¢ Â£

The baby stare could never in the

may cultivate it with some chance of

The natural woman has the advan
tage of being herself always. She may
not be so beautiful, but she is distinct
ly herself. The rage for. beauty, cults
and the experiments that vanity takes
liberties with as a means of beautify
ing is often a beauty killer rather than
an aid.
The various massage lessons that are
working overtime nowadays are not
as responsive as they seem. Scientific
massage, when one can employ an ex
pert, will in many cases preserve one's
youth, but unskillful treatment ac
centuates the defects it seeks to oblit
erate.
Massaging the face requires regular
and extremely careful treatment, for
which one must have both the time
and the price to benefit thereby, other
wise more harm than good will result.
If one can employ an expert, command
ing all of his time for the one duty, as '
in the case of Bernhardt, its purpose
might be served, but I am very much
of the oDinlon that women who pre
serve their youth have inherited the
blessing. Many women who were pret
ty when cirls are wrinkled and shriv
eled at "0. while others not particularly
attractive in youth develop into charm
ing matrons, and are lovely even when
leng past 50. Disposition really has
more to do with preserving good looks
than all the arts of the dermatologist.
The nonsense that breaks loose at
times on the order of the "baby stare"
and the Saint Cecelia enraptured gaze
is simply the most awful rot, and yet
because young people read the stuff
they quietly steal off and behind
closed doors practice with hand mir
rors â and make fools of themselves.
That she was a beauty there was no
denying; even the most fastidious
would have admitted her claim. An
exquisite white rose complexion con
trasted with the ebon hair, worn a la
Lnngtry. Marvelous eyes of brown,
beautiful mouth, splendid teeth, that
made an entrancing picture. To crown
It all, she carried herself with imperial
grace and dignity. Butâ when she
spoke her voice was like the man with
the oboe in the corner. It was a basso

himself might have envied which made

introduction. I wickedly stood near to
watch th2 expression of those meeting
her for the first time. The look of

the hcrcor depicted on women's was
as pathetic as it waa ridiculous. One
man eald that her "throat should have
been cut when she was a child. " It
eounded like murder, but it was only
the thought of the family physician.
Such a voice would have "gained her
a fortune on the stage, but, coming
from between the lips of a beautiful
girl, moving in exclusive Bodal cir
cles, it was fearfully, wondrously un
canny. Both men and women regarded
her with a kind of grewsome awe that
made them stand aloof. This Is. of

To one who Is observant and always
on the lookout for experiences and
sensations, some queer returns come
in at times. At a large social 'function
at a fashionable resort some time ago
the advent of a famed Southern belle
Â¦was heralded by a proud mother and
a large family contingent with elab
orate grusto. The day that was to
usher In the family pride rolled around
and every one shared the excitement
and curiosity.
"Wall, I should' say!" exclaimed the
mother, as she entered the house an
hour later. "Two fond hearts have
been reunited, and here's an old tramp
bound hand and foot and ready to be
carted to jail, and leave nothln' but
happiness in this family!"
(Copyright, 1904, by T. C. McClure.)
but an hour after noon he was return
ing over the same road. He would not
call, he rtald, but Just drive by tha
farm and give Bessie. a chance to call
him In. He had driven up and 'down
three or four times when the silence
of the house began to mystify him,
and he forgot his dignity and hitched
his horse. As he opened the kitchen
door he saw that the pantry door op
posite was fastened. Crossing the
room, he pulled ,the stick from over
the catch and waa rewarded by a
voice saying:
"Oh, Will, but I'm so gladâ so
glad!" :.Â£_Â¦: ;-,;Â¦;;
"Iâ I meant to kiss that bee sting;,*
he replied, "and I was a brute not to.
In fact, my dear, I was all to blame,
and I beg forgiveness, andâ"
| "And there's a tramp In tha house!"
"No call to git skeert, gal," he said,
as he entered the room and closed tha
door. "I was lyin* under the hedge
when the old folks drove away, and I
know ye are alone in the house. I ain't
half bad, unless I'm riled. When I'm
riled, thenldbk out. Now, 1 then, don't
make-any mistakes. Firstly, put some
wlttles on the table. Do as I say and
you shan't be harmed; do some other
way and I . pity you from the bottom
of my heart."
The girl placed a meal on the table,
and, after ordering her to sit opposite
to him, the tramp fell to and satisfied
his appetite. When he shoved back
from the table he said:
"Now, then, I'm goln* through the
crib. I might ask you to go along and
pint out where the valuables are kept,
but I shan't take any chances. I see
that there are wooden bars outside the
pantry windows, and in there you go
till the old folks come home." .
Bessie entered the big pantry without
a word, glad to be out of the .presence
of the man. He fastened the door on
her and then went on a prowl through
the house. There was another door,
however, which he had closed, but not
boltedâ the outside kitchen door. He
was taking his time to make up a bun
dle of , plunder when the door was
softly opened by a sturdy young man.
Will Burt had gone away angry, as
many a lover had done before, but he
hadn't driven a mile before he wished
himself back. Out of sheer pride he
drove on to the village arid tried to
make himself believe ) he didn't care,
Will Burt don't come back- and say he's
sorry â he can Just go to potâ and I'llâ
yes, I'll marry some one else."
"Good for you, gal." exclaimed a
rough voice at the door; and aha
sprang away from the churn with a
scream, to find herself facing tha
toughest-looking tramp she had ever
seen.
Ever since her sixteenth birthday
the had been "somewhat engaged,"
es she expressed it, to Will Burt. son
of the village merchant, and previous
to her going to Bchool he had driven
out to the farm once or twice every
week. Farmer Martin and his wife
had looked upon It as a case of "calf
love," and had neither encouraged nor
discouraged, but when three years had
passed In the same fashion thlng3 had
begun to look more serious. The en
gagement was announced, with the
consent cf the parents on both sides.
Love did not run smoothly, how
ever. Bessie wanted to put In one
more term and graduate, and Will In
sisted on marriage in the fall. Both
being quick- tempered and impulsive,
they had had many a small quarrel
before, but on this occasion It threat
ened to degenerate into something se
rious.
Will bad driven out to the farm
in the forenoon to urge the matter
from his standpoint, and as Bessie
had that day been chased by a cow,
stung by a bumble bee and fallen
down the back steps, she was In no
mood for gentle argument. It wasn't
long before the pair were at logger
heads, and v.hen the young man left
S ESSIE Martin was the only
daughter, and only child, for
that^ matter, of Farmer Martin
and his wife. She had come
home from the academy on her
rummer vacation, and at ninteen
years old she was handsome enough
and cute enough to turn the heads of
a dozen young men between daylight
and dark.
"He probably forgot." soothed the
mother, as she handed over her ging
ham apron as a tear- wiper. "I know
one time when your father was court-
Ing me I fell off a fence and â "
"But I'm not talking about you and
pa," Interrupted Bessie, as a fresh as
sortment of sobs threatened to stick in
her throat. "Will Burt finds me a suf-
"Oh, come, now."
"It isn't as If I couldn't have forty
other beaux if I wanted 'em. I don't
like his saying that he's going to do
this and he's going to do that, just as
if he ran the earth. He knew I'd cry
when he was gone, but did he ever turn
to .look at the house when he drove
away? He ktoows how It hurts to be
stung by a bumble bee, but when I
showed him the swelling on my 'left
arm, did he say it 'was too bad* and
kiss It?" -,:e
"I don't think he wants to boss."
"He does. He not only wants to boss,
but he's selfish. I told him I'd almost
been hooked by a cow, was stung by a

sit down and hold my hand and pity
me? Not a pity! He Just went on to
tell me that he could buy a house and
all that, and that we'd be married in
October. He talked as if I had no voice
in the matter."

drive furiously away. It was with the
understanding that if he never re
turned no hearts would be broken.
"La me, but how silly," exclaimed
the mother, as she came In from the
kitchen and fcund Bessie kneeling on
the door with her head burled in the
lounge and sobs choking her utter
ance.
The girl slept not only for an hour,
but for three. She was then awakened
by her mother, who explained that she
and the father had to drive to town to
see about some legal business, and that
Bessie must mind the house for the
afternoon. A quarter of an hour later
they were off, and, after taking a little
walk in the garden and reading a story,
Bessie happened to remember that the
cream was In the churn, ready to be
beaten into butter that evening, so she
decided to go ahead with it. The churn
was placed near the open kitchen door
and when she first sat down she had a
book in her left hand. Thoughts of
Will Burt were uppermost, however,
and gradually the book sank down to
her lap and she worked tha dasher and
reflected at the same time:
"If I hadn't been chased by a cow â
and stung by a bumble beeâ and fell
down the steps and rolled over among
the weedsâ and waa feeling all broken
up it wouldn't have matteredâ but he
never pitied me â and he didn't ask to

makes me miserable and drives me into
saying that I could marry some one

"Well now, you go an' He down awhile
until that bee sting gits better and you

son of the fact that Miss Patch was
detained at home, the paper was read
by the president of the California
Federation â Mrs: Georjre Law Smith.
It was written for the conference of
library workers held at the Odeon, St.

presented by a California woman.

the work that has been accomplished
by California Federation control,
through the committee on libraries and
portfolios.
There . are many difficulties which

degrees of latitude, corresponding to
the difference on the Atlantic coast be
tween Edlsto Inlet, South Carolina, and
Cape Cod, Massachusetts. Between the
extreme northwest and southeast cor
ners, the direct distance is 775 miles;
its maximum width Is 235 miles, and Its
area above 158,000 square miles.
2. The splendidly endowed system of
puDllc i BChools and the ever- widening
interdependence of school and univer
sity, imperatively, needing the further

ley Art Club circulated a traveling
gallery of over 300 pictures. In Los
Angeles, the Ebell Club furnishes threa
portfolios of pictures.
At the last session of tha Legislature
the Trustees of tha Stats Library se
cured such an enlargement of their
powers as enables them to send out
traveling libraries. Fifty libraries of
fifty volumes each were immediately
prepared and are now in circulation.
California may. therefore, be said to ba
under a sort of ideal Joint control-
State and Federation. The two organi
zations working together In perfect
harmony have this year 112 traveling
libraries making their beneficent jour
neys about our little world.
All that Federation control In Cali
fornia has done is but an earnest of
the things that it shall do. All agen*
des, all controls are blest, which, seek
ing the sweet diffusion of general hap
piness, bring us into one close and en
larging bond of unionâ the Federation
of the World.
Great Interest was shown last year In
portfolio work and picture study, and
we hope to accomplish fuarther good
In this direction. "We have now fifteen
we hope to accomplish further good
merit the name of traveling galleries.
A year later the executlva board eÂ«
the California Federation adopted tha
work of library extension and appoint
ed a committee on libraries and port*
folios.
The first work of this committed waa
to publish the new library law, with a
list of the Incorporated towns entitled
to its provisions. These wera distri
buted to the clubs, which wera urged
to begin agitation everywhere for ths
free public library. The clubs of tha
six districts responded generously to
appeals for traveling libraries from
their respective vice chairmen. Tet
while these libraries have -dona tha
work suggested by the State Commit
tee, their control and maintenance has
always remained with the club owners,
as the surest means of securlnr tha
interest of clubwomen In tha work
undertaken, and of promptly educat
ing'public sentiment. At the closÂ» of
the first year's work we had forty-ftv*
libraries In circulation, as against
twenty-four libraries maintained by In
dividual clubs.
The quality of these libraries had
also greatly improved since It becama
understood that they were to bo used In
creating an Interest In the free publlo
library- The second year closed with
sixty-two traveling libraries In tha
field, a gain of twelve over the previous
year. Several towns had been Incor
porated in order to secure tha library
tax, and in two or three places tha frea
public library had been established.
The efforta of the State committee
this year, briefly stated, are: To aid la
the establishing of free public libraries
In the Incorporated towns, and to urga
the incorporating of towns for this pur
pose. To this end we have republlshed
the general library law of California,
and revised the list of incorporated
towns, giving their class, population
and Carnegie and other gifts for li
brary buildings.
In 1901 the Leagua of California
Municipalities succeeded In securlne
the passage of the general library law.
The new statute provides for an ap
pointive board cf trustees, with partial
charge of membership yearly, men and
women being equally eligible as trus
tees. It authorizes contracts between
library boards and county Supervisors
for the use of traveling libraries, and
it allows an increase of library tax in
cities, from 1 to 2 mills on tha dollar.
Its distinguishing feature Is tha man
datory provision for the establishment
of free libraries in all Incorporated
cities r: ,n petition of 25 per csnt of
the legal vote.
So far the efforts of our dub women
may be said to have had but one pur
pose, that of sending soma healthful
Instruction and stimulus to tha Isolated
homes in our great commonwealth.
It was fervently hoped that this ben
lflcent enterprise would pass beyond
our small endeavors, as elsewhere It
had so succeeded, and that tha State
would adopt the work and extend It
thereafter as her own.
where naturally encouraged their Cali
fornia sisters to adopt their methods
as a practical solution of their library
difficulties. The credit of having be
gun this work in California is due tha
California Club of San Francisco, which
in January, 1900, sent out in quick suc
cession five traveling libraries. Ths
president of the California Club, Mrs.
Lovell White, also suggested this work
to the convention which met In Los
Angeles January 15, 1900. for tha pur
pose of organizing the California Fed
eration of "Women's Clubs. The sugges
tion was adopted with spirit by tha
Los Angeles District Federation, and
the work systematically organized.
For the following two years traveling
library work was carried on by tha
California Club, with five libraries, tha
Los Angeles District Federation with
ten, Placerville with five and San Diego
with four libraries.

and out of the gay throng at tha

gowns.
He walked across the deserted li

of a small den, stepped into semi
darkness.
On the broad window seat a swirl
of fluffy white stirred and a startled
head arose.

Â¦ The best man was surprised to hear
her catch her breath. He had not

maid of honor, not having realized
that a sharp tongue may give utter
ance to sympathy and gentleness. The
discovery opened new vistas to him.
"But not a treasure we should be

She shook her head dubiously.
"There's no hope for the analytical.

why did I think I cared for him?

merely because It was another chap

"How do you know?" she cried sit

He laughed the low, pleased laugh
of a flattered man.
"It's the way I feel about Elsa," ha
said.
"And the way I feel , about Ralph,"
she gasped.
In the silence they could hear the
talk and laughter of tha wedding

"And yet," she began.
"And yet," he interrupted. "They
are the happy ones. They have found

Apparently Torrington was the only
one who did not notice the fervor
thrown into the rehearsals, and when
it was brought to his attention he
merely smiled complacently and re
marked that he hoped the speaker
might be able to play his part as well
on the fateful night.
Gradually this indifference was ac
cepted as a client admission that Tor

test In favor of his more attractive
rival, and, when he was not around,
the men began to speak of "Poor"

and possibly supplying a foundation
for a building fund, the golf club
crowd decided that he must be crazy.
This belief was strengthened when
Torrington placidly consented to act
as property man and made no effort
to prevent Herbert Ranson becoming
stage manager. - It was well known
that Kittle Clausen favored these two
of her numerous train of admirers.
Torrington was the type of man
who most enjoyed doing things for
others. He was not a handsome chap.
In spite of his bright eyes and clear
complexion. He was rather short of
Etature (dumpy, Ranson called him),
and his favor with Kittie Clausen had
been gained by his qualities of mind
and disposition. Ranson. on the other
hand, was as striking in appearance
as the hero of a cheap novel He made
an Ideal hero for the play and even at
rehearsals he put a deal of feeling into
the love scenes with Klttte.

room with so curt a "good evening"
that even Torrington gasped.
Ranson looked surprised, but there
was no | time then for explanations,
and he went off to the dressing-room
where the professional actor had in
stalled himself.
The shelf In front of the mirror was
covered with sticks -of paint of all
colors, boxes of powder and the va
rious Implements of make-up art, all
redolent of the cheap perfume, added
to conceal the rancidity of the greas*
used as a foundation.
Ranson, to whom the process of
making up was not new, submitted to
the heavy applications of paint and
powder and started back to the stage
to superintend the final preparations.
Presently Kittle emerged from her
dressing-room and he went toward
her. She shrank from him. . While
she knew that make-up was required,
she was not accustomed to seeing men
with paint on their faces and there
was something oddly repulsive In" the
appearance of this man with his
heavily lined eyebrows, rouged cheeks
and whitened. temples. It seemed like
a ghastly mask of the man she knew â
like the badly painted portrait of an
acquaintance.
During the first act the excitement
of playing was too . great to permit
her to turn her attention to other
thoughts. She could not permit her
mind to be diverted for an instant
from her next speech, the next move
across the stage.
With the second act came greater
confidence. It was here that the. love
scenes commenced, but they did not
seem the same as at rehearsal. She
at the completeness and suddenness of
his surrender.
But Torrington was not worried. If
he was aware of the compassion of the
men and the scorn of the women he did
not show it, and his moonllke face was
always lighted by a peaceful smile as
he sat by the prompter's table at re
hearsals and watched the proceedings.
He acted as useful man about the
stage, reading the part of some one un
able to attend rehearsal, holding the
book as prompter or performing any
Blight service asked of him.
Ranson, who possessed considerable
ability as an actor, worked hard with
his cast of amateurs, but it is not easy
to teach the art of acting, and when in
the course of time the repetition of mis
takes drove him frantic he gradually
lost command over his temper and at
the dress rehearsal he had to apologize
to the entire company (Including Kittle)
at various times throughout the even
ing.
The others absolved him, but that
evening Torrington walked home with
Kittle, to the great surprise of all.
Their astonishment would have been
greater had they known that the invi
tation came from Miss Clausen herself.
But If Miss Clausen had transferred
her favors to Jimmie in the hope of
finding in him a ready sympathizer she
was in error. Torrington was sorry
that her feelings had been hurt, but
he was not prepared to admit that
Ranson was to blame. Oddly enough,
his defense of Ranson served to In
crease her sense of injury. When the
night of the performance arrived she
was scarcely civil to the stage man
ager and flounced Into her dressing-
could not endure the touch of this
man, with paint-covered features,, and
the penetrating odor of bergamot,
heavy almost to nausea, sickened her
nostrils. The scene was like a night
mare. Even worse was the last act
with its powerful closing scene. The
touch of his greasy lips upon her
cheek, the unnatural look of the eyes
made brilliant by the dark circles of
crayon, startled her and before the
curtain rang, down she felt that she
should scream.
Leaving the stage after the last tab
leau, Hanson caught her hand, i
"Can't you forgive last night. Kit
tle, and make the 'yes' you have Just
spoken your answer to the question I
have wanted to ask for so long?"
She tore her hand from his grasp.
"Don't you dare speak to me like
that," she panted. "If you do not let
me go I shall call Mr. Torrington."
Ranson threw, a black look at Tor
rington, who was placidly gathering
up small stage furnishings, dropped
her hand and turned away.
"Jimmie," she asked softly, "do you
want to take' me home again, to
night?"
"Do I?" repeated Torrington. "I'd
like to take you to a home of our own.
Kittle."
She smiled demurely. "I think you
may," she said.
That night Jimmie Torrington ad

And Wriggles blinked an approving

only said:
"Don't sit up like that in a Hongkong

"You're horrid, Ralph Dinsmore,"
was the only reply she vouchsafed him.

upon the cushions. One couldn't afford
to look awkward in the eyes of any
man. even a man that one fully intends
to refuse.
The warm gold of the afternoon sun
light was gradually paling and a chi:l
was creeping stealthily into the suave
air. Dinsmore, recognizing the sisns
of late afternoon, looked at his watch.
Just a half hour until the 5 o'clock boat
would bear him away from this corner
In Paradise back to San Francisco.
He drew "a small case from his pocket
and calmly handed it to Miss Chester

"You like old Jewels! See what you
think of It," was his matter-of-fact
comment.
She obeyed him, drawing from the
case a ring of quaint workmanship in
which two beautiful pearls were im

"Beautiful!" she exclaimed, enthusi

Miss Chesterton's glance slowly de

"There was the weather!" she ar

Just a perceptible stress upon the last

resumed the conversation once more.
"All men don't:" was her some

DInsmore had the air of a man sud

She flushed and looked injured. Al

"Don't forget what one's talking

his contrite plea. "You see. I feel like

up and over, step by step, until it

A little scream broke the stillness.
Coming back from a dreamy, sensu

the long, fat, glutinous snail stretched

look back to a golden age when no
doors were barred and all men lived
Â«n honest life under the eight Just laws
of Kl-tse, their first ruler. Kl-tse, or
KitEU, as he is sometimes called, an
ancestor of the great Confucius, was a
brother of the Emperor of China, who.
trowing disgusted with the evils of
Chinese court life, set out for Korea,
where he established a court of his
own, became a powerful King, and was
beloved by all for his humanity and
Justice. This was in the first quarter
of the twelfth century, B. C
Time came when the Blmple code of
laws decreed by Ki-tee no longer suf
ficed for the complex civilization which
had grown up in Korea. Naturally the
ancient legislation of China was drawn
upon to form a more elaborate Juris
prudence. During the ascendency of
the dynasty of Minn (1368-1644), the
Korean criminal code attained the form
and substance of a body of laws which
have been handed down In all their
cruelty from generation to generation
with very little Improvement. Twice
eince ITfej the severity of the Korean
code" was mitigated by royal edict, but
in its main provisions It remained in
force until 1S35.
The recent attempt to graft the dem
ent Jurisprudence of the West on the
crude and cruel Mongolian stock has
go far proven abortive. Having, re
ceived no preparation for the institu
tions of Western civilization, the
classes of crimes which are punished
by death. The following are consid
ered by the Koreans as the most
heinous offenses:
1. Crimes against the state.
2. Crimes against the person, the
nepulchers or the residence of the sov
ereign. A person found guilty even
of climbing the wall of the Emperor's
residence i3 put to death.
3. Disloyalty to country.
4. Crimes against the law of hu
manity and nature, such are parricide,
matricide, the murder of one's own
children, etc.
6. The theft of official documents,
seals, goods or treasures.
6. Insurrection.
7. Burglary, theft with violence,
piracy, etc.'
8. Murder, attempted murder,
homicide committed in a quarrel, kid
naping with | violence a married
woman or a young girl and many
other crimes of a similar character.
Many crimes not mentioned in the
code are also punished by death ac
cording to the method of Interpreta
tion, called by the Chinese "pifuyu
yuanyiri," namely, by a system of an
alogy. As a matter of fact, until the
conclusion of the Japan-Chinese war
In 1S05, capital punishment in Korea
was inflicted much at the will of the
so-called Judge. Persons merely sus
pected of crime were often so cruelly
tortured by their inquisitors that kind
death many times extended the hand
of mercy refused by the officers of Jus
tice.
As in China and Slam, two legal
methods of executing ' criminals are
commonly employedâ decapitation and
strangulation, though the old methods
are frequently used, contrary to the
new code. Until quite recently, 'culprits
who were executed by the sword were
not only decapitated, but their hands
and feet were also cut off, after which
the mutilated body was exposed in a
public place for three days.
Since 1895. the death penalty has been
usually carried out without corporal
punishment anterior to the execution,
and torture has been formally abolish
ed. The present law provides that exe
cutions take place within closed doors,
in a retired room within the . prison.
Criminals convicted of political crimes
are beheaded, while executions for
crimes of common right are by stran
gulation. The gallows was introduced
into Korea by Clarence R. Greathouse
of San Francisco, while he, was legal
advisor to that Government.
Witnesses are still thrown into prison
in Korea together with the condemned
criminals, but a new code is about to
be promulgated (the "Code Penal de
la Korea," drafted by the present
learned legal advisor, M. Cremazy)
which will abolish this last legal bar
barity.
The legal abolishment of barbarity in
Korea does not, however, necessarily
imply the actual disappearance of
primitive cruelties. Though torture, as
said above, was legally abolished In
1S95, It is still practiced to a great ex
tent even in the prisons of Seoul, and
it is the common rule in the interior.
Another vestige of barbarity which is
â¢also met with in the interior Is expo
sure of the bodies. At present there
seems to be a general tendency, all
over Korea, to revert to the old cus
toms regarding punishments.
In conclusion It may be' said that
Korea' now has an elaborate and.thor
oughly modern legal machineryâ on
paperâ but the provisions of Its codes
are daily violated, not only by the
grossly corrupted officials, but even by
tacit consent of the reigning monarch.
highway and an ax is laid by her, with
which all passers by, except noblemen,
are obliged to give her a stroke on

town In which the murder was com
mitted is in temporary disgrace; the
Judges are suspended, the Governor
removed and the town made subordin
ate to another place; or at best only
a private citizen is left in authority.
This punishment is now legally If not
actually abolished.

rea as the personal property of the
husband and her life* Is wholly In his
hands, so much so that he may kill

merely producing proof of his wife's
guilt.
The Korean Jurisprudence permits
no conviction on a charge of felony
unless the man accused acknowledges.
the crime, hence the introduction of
torture. Theoretically the torture is
applicable only in cases where theevl
dences of the prisoner's guilt are very
strong, if not conclusive. Only a light
form of torture > is legally allowable in
cases of misdemeanor. The torture of
witnesses Is not permissible under the
law. But the Korean Judges have sel
dom scrupled to pervert or Ignore
both the spirit and the letter of the
law and Judges have been known to
torture fatally men merely suspected
of a crime." On the other hand,'ac
cused persons are frequently acquit
ted for a consideration, though the
evidences of their guilt are conclu
sive. Since 1895 a mixed commission,
with the constant advice of the dis
tinguished Jurist, M. Cremazy, has
done much to soften the cruelties of
a criminal code which is scarcely
equaled for its barbarity.
There are. still fourteen different
Koreans cling tenaciously to their an
cient customs, borrowed as they are
from the most ancient Chinese sources.
So ancient, Indeed, are some of the
borrowed customs of Korea that even
the tardy Chinese have outgrown them.
Thus we find Chinese elements In
Korean life that are more Chinese than
In China.
As In nearly all' countries where
slavery exists, the slave was subjected
to the most Inhuman punishments.
While it was regarded as hardly a
misdemeanor for a master to murder
a clave, even upon the slightest provo
cation, yet the slave who resented his
master's blows by killing him was
cruelly tormented to death. First
trampling him nearly to death, they
then poured vinegar down his throat
through a funnel. When his stomach
was properly distended, they beat him
with cudgels until he burst. The pun
ishment for theft, until 1895, was al
most equally severe, thieves also being
brutally trampled to death. In spite
of this horrible punishment, theft has
always been a very common crime
among the Koreans. Treason, as In
all absolute monarchies, is still pun
ished with the greatest severity, and
the penalty involves not only the actual
offender but the lives of all his kin.
Desecration of graves Is another capital
offense, which involves in its punish
ment all the male relatives of the of
fender to the fifth degree. The males
are beheaded, while the mother, wife
or daughter are usually poisoned.
There are, indeed, a few cases where
the husband is decapitated without the
wife being officially poisoned. . .

a big one. What you have got to do 13
to teach her their use â to "play" with
your baby until she learns to love the
right kind of play.
The very .beginning of a girl's domes
tic training is the cultivation of the
"mother instinct." If your little girl
does not love her dollies, teach her to
love them. If she looks upon them
merely as pretty trinkets of bisque and
sawdust, teach her that they are her
own babies, just as she is yours, and
as such should "be cared for. Get her a
doll that she can wash and dress and
comb and put to sleep; then teach her
how to do these things for It. If you
wish her to grow up to become a good
THE modern rmall girl is reared
like an ancient Princess. She
is taught all the arts and graces
&nl none of the real usefulness of
life. iÂ»he L* trained to manicure
her little iiink finger nails, to value
her complexion, to wear her frocks
properly, to speak French, to under-
Ftand music, to handle a horse and to
choose without fall the cut and color
most beccrr.ir.s to her.
Her mother plays, alternately, slave
and clown to her whims, sews for her,
trr.usrs her and waits u?on her. Her
father wastes his substance paying her
xnuslc bills, bonbon bills, cab fares anil
boarding-school fees â and wonders if
he ever will "get around" to buy;::s
a new overcoat for himself. She is
sophisticated nt years old and.
at that :.pe. has already decided
whether *^e urill marry or train for ;Â¦..
professiun and what sort of an estab
lishment she would like to keep.
As to how she will keÂ«Â»;> this es
tablishment not a thought once en
ters her pretty, flighty head. She
fancies ih-it modern housekeeping is
merely a matter of getting the proper
servants anJ catching: a husband who
can v.7i<.>:-'i to pay them the proper
wages. She knows the never will be
called upon to bake or fry and she
thinks darning l>as gone out of
fashion. iVt modern housekeeping is.
Just like old-fashioned housekeeping,
an art â the finest of all the feminine
fine arts. Homo making is a science!
end the home that is made by modern
servants is worse than a badly run
boarding-ho-jse. Every real "home"
has its btiry in the soul of the little
woman who is its mistress. It is as
much an exiiressifn of her personality
as is a poem or a sons a reflection of its
author; and. In fact, a "home" should
be something of both a poem and a
There are still a few "old-fashioned"
mothers who fancy they are dutifully

teach them to be frugal and industri
ous, to count the price of butter and
the pennies in a dollar and to darn
a sock until it is difficult to find an

woman to learn. It never yet kept a

too. Is a wonderful talent, but too
znuch Industry has driven many a man
to the club to get away from the
woman who can never get away from
her work and her troubles.
It Is the cultivation of the "home"
spirit in a girl from the days of her
babyhood which makes her a good
housewife. Teach her to love "home
making"; train her to look with inter
est at a dish, with pleasure at a dainty
table, with joy at books and flowers
and brooms and pail?, and with longing
at everybody's baby; and as sure as a
sunflower follows the sun, industry,
frugality, love and domestic success
will follow In her wake. Give her the
right "object of thought" and she will
place her thought, and her talent, too,
upon that object.
It is not necessary, as our grand
mothers.' excellent housewives that
they were, once fancied, to set our lit
tle girl at the daily grind of wielding a
darning needle, making heavy beds
and keeping a tedious account book.
Such horrors alone are enough to make
any baby hate the thought of house
keeping and to make her regard her
future husband as a Prince Charming.
who will come to deliver her from the
ogre of domestic drudgery and carry
her off to the happiness and luxury of
life in a modern apartment hotel, or
even a boarding-house. If you want a
child to love a thing it is a mistake to
make that thing a task. But there are
better and wiser and more effective
ways of turning a little girl's eyes and
heait toward her future "home" and
the making of It.
If any mother will walk through the
toy department of a modern store her
eyes will fall uron a thousand devices
which the wise and wonderful toy
makers have hit upon for training a
child's mind. There are toy musical in
struments for cultivating the musical
instinct of the baby, toy engines to in
terest the boy In the science of me
chanics, toy Jewels, toy golf sets and
toy automobiles. In fact, every inter
esting article that Is made exists in
miniature for the miniature men and
women. Among all these toys there are
none so numerous or so wonderful as
those made expressly for the little girl
who would play at "housekeeping" and
"mother." Dolls are so wonderfully
constructed that one almost expects to
see them come to life. They .talk, sing,
laugh, walk and go to. sleep. Dolly's
bed is ideally built and fitted up; her
bathtub, her*toi!et set. her clothes,
jewels, hats and furniture, from her
kitchen to her :>inzza hammock and
garden hose, are. all as complete as
yours or mine, and all so cheap that
one wonders how they can net their
manufacturer anything. Put your
money in some of these and see the ef
fect upon your daughter.
"But my little girl has a whole room
full of toys," you say, "and yet she
continues to remain a tomboy. I buy
her French dolls and she plays with
her brother's steam engine and base
ball bat. I buy her brooms and dust
pans and she keeps the nursery looking
as though a thunder storm had swept
it."
But merely "buying" things for a
A^dining-table and all sorts of dishes
are, above all. the most Important of
the little girl's play outfit. Some day
she will have to reach a man's heart
through his stomach, and nothing ia
eo conduci\ - e to a good masculine ap
petite as a daintily and attractively
arranged table. Even if your little girl
is a daughter of wealth and expects
to hold a place in society she will need
to learn the art of dinner giving; and
she can begin its accomplishment right
In the nursery. Teach her the value of
table ferns, white linen and shining
silver: teach her to pour tea and make
a salad from babyhood; for there 13
nothing so clings to and distinguishes
a girl as her baby training.
Of course, as soon as your girl grows
large enough to like duties as duties
ehe will put aside her baby toys and
learn to do things in grown-up fashion.
But If she has already gotten the do
mestic fever, if she has already ac
quired the home Instinct, if she has al
ready learned "something about every
thing" in a house, it is very likely that
she will, of her own accord, enter upon
domestic duties with a vim, a delight,
a confidence and a skill that would
Her toy house must, -of course, have
its kitchen and therein every article of
domestic use, from the teakettle to
the washtub, with all of which she
should become perfectly familiar. With
such appurtenances, the making of
mud pies will become a science as well
as a pleasure and the laundering of
her doll's frocks a familiar duty. Shs
will soon understand the use and abuse
of every pot, kettle and pan and will
learn how to handle an ironing board
and a broom. When she has finished
"playing hou3e" she should be trained
to leave her "tins" shining and in their
proper places on the walla of her
kitchen, her stove polished and her
tuba in order.
mother, teach her to love her toy
"child" with that mother instinct that
Is born in every girl baby. Once you
have accomplished this and have in
stilled In your little daughter the feel
ing of responsibility for her dolly's wel
fare you have sown the seed of domes
ticity In her soul and heart and It will
prow as you water it. If the modern
woman fancies her life Is complete
without children it is because as a lit
tle thing: . she was not taught to love
and value her dollies.

that hangs In graceful 'olds and which
may be used on the edge of Indian Bilk
for a fichu.
Although the soft white necker
chief of our grandmothers has evolved
Into an elaborate affair. It Is still quite
as picturesque and apparently quite aa
popular. The fichu has but one fault-
It will "ride" ud the back of one's
neck unless properly folded, and if It
Is loosened, to allow tha folds to
straighten out, the two sides will not
meet properly in front without giving
a drawn look: so it behooves one to
have them properly cut and properly
folded.
Another secret which Is worth re
membering is given upon the authority
of an expert fichu-maker. She says for
a square yard fichu the ruffles should
be at least six yards long before gath
ering. In other words, a yard and a
half of ungathered ruffling should be
allowed for every yard of material.
and twelve inches wide. It is made
pointed in front by a slanting cut
from the outer edge five-eighths of a
yard from the ends. The edge is then
finished with three rows of black
chenille cord, stitched with white silk
thread. Wtfen finished such a flchu
should be fastened to the waist Just
above the bust line with rosettes of
black velvet ribbon.
Handkerchiefs are another material
that should not be neglected, for since
their craze they have been evolved
a chou of white roses dangled.
Pink cherry blossoms may be used
effectively upon such a gown, and also
white roses and marguerite daisies.
Even violets may be utilized. for this
fichu effect, and when perfumed will
please the sense quite as much as the
eye. Flowers for this sort of decora
tion need not be necessarily made of
silks and velvets and fashioned' after
the regulation factory style, for among
the prettiest and daintiest accessories
are the flowers fashioned from bits of
ribbon and made in spare minutes at
home. "J,
The girl who is not blessed with, a
well-rounded out pocket book should
espouse the flchu cause with great fer
vor. Why? Simply because two gowns
will serve for six, and the transforma
tion is made by using a variety of
fichus. A simple white frock trimmed
with one made of pale blue chiffon,
hand painted with a border of pink
rosebuds, looks absolutely different
from the same foundation trimmed
with a soft white mull, with billows
of dainty ruffles all edged with Valen
ciennes. Or again the flchu may be
made of three ruffles of lace and caught
at the waist line with a flower or a
soft bow of satin ribbon.
An exquisitely dainty flchu may be
made of white chiffon. It has two four
and a half inch frills of accordion
pleated chiffon. Aad on* of ita best
O"f QUAINT and picturesque femi
f I nine type made her debut with
Â£ I the early roses. A breath of
X spring always seems to linger
about her and Bhe is as spark
ling and sweet as a rose herself, this
edition de luxe of her great-grand
mother. First she timidly borrowed
ideas from the great attic chest but
now she boldly robs the cedar, and her
latest steal has been the old-fashioned
but altogether charming fichu.
When fche doffed her old furbelows
and donned the new in all its charm
ing simplicity this fichu girl im
personated the Puritan maiden type to
a marked degree, even to cultivating
the low, musical voice and the modest
demeanor. For, you see, to be any
thing else would be entirely out of
keeping with her new badge of sweet
daintiness, which she will wear on any
and all occasions, and if it were but
known she has figured out that many
a masculine heart will be captured and
held by her own and the fichu's
various charms.
This fetching summer girl is a dia
phanous creature in her soft, fluffy
gowns, which are so full at the hip
and flare so broadly at the bottom.
Whether her frocks are of mousseline,
fishnet or bobbinet it matters not but
each one has a fichu that is made on
an entirely new plan, for she brooks no
similarity in any of them. To be sure
this has meant not a little study and
the display of surprising ingenuity, but
once started upon her favorite themeN
no two have been, so far, alike.
The new printed silk mousselines of
the Dolly Varden order, but as much
prettier as modern appliques can make
them, look as though the freshest blos
soms of the season have been dropped
carelessly over them. The latter stands
out in bold relief like panne velvet and
when made over a contrasting shade
of silk the effect of these mousselines
is bewitching.
A pure white one with violets sprink
led over it has been worn by the lassie
whose choice of colors Is Invariably
the same. The one bit of color was the
violet silk which the flchu was draped
over, crossing V fashion in front, fast
ening at the waist line with a baroque
pearl pin. Occasionally the triple frills
of the fichu may be piped with black
velvet baby ribbon to give a little
Frenchy touch, and the ends hang
from the -waist line nearly to the bot
tom of the skirt
The new printed bebbincts are splen
did for fichu effects, and are great fa
vorites with the summer girl. A white
one which has email pink rosebuds
scattered over it dresses up a plain
gown till it scarcely knows itself, and
certainly no one else does. A pretty
way to finish such a one Is to edge
the double accordion pleated ruffles
with a pink chenille cord. This crosses
in the front and fastens at the waist
line in tbe back, falling like sash ends
to the bottom of the frock.
One of the most charmingly original
fichus was made to wear with a mid^
summer frock of printed fishnet The
latter had a seagreen figure and was
made over green silk. The flchu really
was a rose collar. It wars made of small
white botton roses sewed lengthwise
together to resemble sprays, and was
laced in and out with black velvet rib
bons, which had long ends from which
clover, for they can never be used ts)
better advantage.
Spanish' laces made charming ones,
and . the three-cornered mantilla fre
quently served a double purpose. When
worn for a fichu the back should . be
laid in crosswise folds and caught at
the top of the bodice that . it .will
stay in position. The lonsr ends are
then tied In front and are permitted to
bmae gracefully where they will. The
!%Â«â¢ to smart la itself, but black velvet
rwtttea on the ends and a large chou
for the uses of these squares, and
right smart ones they make, too. The
newest fad is to take a man's large
silk handkerchief, cut a circular hole
in the center about eight inches deep,
then slash the silk from the center to
one point This leaves a deep flounce
of black velvet ribbon where it closes,
perhaps a trifle to the left, is a smart
effect that Is well worth, the trouble
and time expended.
Soft point d'esprit is pretty, particu
larly when made circular in three sec
tions, one and three-quarter yards Ions
14
points is that It may be worn berth*
fashion around the top of a bodice with
either a high or a low necked gown, or
it may be worn crossed in front and
fastened with a dainty floral pin.
And, by the way, floral pins are a
new ornament that have been ' turned
out as a finishing touch' for the -fichu.
Not of silver nor yet of gold, are they
fashioned, but of chiffon, to match the
fichu itself. For instance' one was
made to represent an exaggerated edel
weiss with folded petals. A safety pia
underneath keeps the blossom In posi
tion and at the same time "holds the.
fichu itself firmly in place.
The slender girl who can stand-quan
tities of fluff and feather causes the
pleating to stand out gracefully, so that
it really flares at the edge.
When made after this style o.na /
thing must be remembered - and .' that .
is in dry cleaning, them the edge of
the frills "must be tacked so that the
pleatings will not come out. If this ia
neglected the fichu might as well . be
relegated to the darkest corner in the
attic, for it droops .in a pathetic way
and acts as though. it was most woe-.
fully ashamed of Itself.
An Imported fichu, which, by the .
way," Is strikingly Parisian, is made of
wide, white silk lace. Two long plas
trons of all-over lace are made over
pale yellow silk. These cross over the
shoulders and are edged with two rows *
of four-Inch lace. They meet at the
waist line in the back and are closed
with a Jabot of black velvet which
has long ends. The ends In front are
finished in jabot fashion, also with
black velvet, ribbons.
These pretty things are not only worn
with thin white or, daintily colored
organdies, but with other fabrics' as
well, for as an accessory for silk voile
or challie there is nothing more grace
ful or chic for a finish about the
shoulders. Of course, nothing is* quite
as handsome as rare old laces, and the
girl who is fortunate enough to possess

wood, and, , if you're all very good
and don't hinder, we may, find you
something eatable in due time. Now
you," to the flattered major, "keep
everybody, else amused some way
while we get supper."
- "That girl, is aâ aâ brick!" he mur
mured, admiringly, and j proceeded to
obey orders to the best of his ability.
The merry cries from the kitchen end
of the establishment helped him in his
efforts.
"Crackers!" caroled the captain en
couragingly. "Half a barrelful. And a
can of cream frozen almost solid. I'll
have to sweeten some for dessert."
A few moments of laughter and ap
parent investigation.
"Now a girl like that," the major waa
pondering, unable to keep his jealous
glance from wandering.
Then a burst of triumph from the
kitchen: "Oh. see what I've found!
Cans and cans of them! Now for a
feast!"
Then a period of busy silence and
strengthening odors.
In less time than the famished trav
elers had dared hope they were ranged
before bowls brimming with a steam
ing and savory -concoction, the very
sight of which increased their faith in
a sheltering Providence.
"Fall to, fall to!" urged the appar
ently untiring girl, waving a long ladle
like a magician's wand. "There are
gallons and gallons, and I don't want
to see a motionless spoon -till every
drop has vanished." "
They needed no second Invitation. As
the major leaned back after a | fourth
polishing of his bowl, the girl came up
with a platter. "Take this," she whis
pered, "and gather the biggest sort of
a collection to leave in payment for
our entertainment."
And the plate grew heavy as he went
the rounds, supported by the voice of
the girl from her stool pedestal.
yi V AJOR BLACKBURN was pos
f 8ess Â«d of a temperament no
more Irascible than that of the
JL average gentleman of his age.
Moreover, the dignity of that age might
have gone unsuspected by virtue of his
boyish ' face and genial, if somewhat
pompous, manner had It not been for
the tell-tale appurtenances of a veter
an's title and a great grown-up son
of the modern, broad-shouldered type.
.But the major was Inclined to take
it good naturedly. Aspiring to youth
fulness in old age was not one of his
hobbles. He was guilty, nevertheless;
of two: a pet ideal and a pet aversion.
The first was an imaginary picture he
had conjured up of an old-time girl
who scorned "higher education" and
devoted herself to the acquisition of an
endless string of housewifely accom
plishments. The second was tomatoes.
Utterly unfit to eat! He knew it be
yond hope of conversion. Furthermore,
they sickened him unto deathâ upon
his word as a gentleman and soldier I
His thoughts were neither of the vis
ionary maid nor the detested vegetable
as he strode up and down the aisle of
the chilly car. They had been fighting
snow and wind since four p. m., and
now it was ten, and the drifts piled
higher. Something had happened to
the steam-pipes, and comfortable
warmth was fast becoming a more and
more distant memory. Worst of all,
they had not yet succeeded in reaching
the place where the dinner was taken
on; and dlnnerless, the major was
unhappy.
"Where in the world are we, and
what are- we stopping for this time?"
he growled, as a blue-nosed brakeman
swung through.
"Stopping because we can't go no
further," was the answer. "This here's
Graves Station, and we're telegraphing
for relief. Let you know directly," as
he disappeared.
"Comforting, to say the least. Win
dows bo frosted you can't see outâ
probably nothing to see If you could.
How a cup of coffee now would cheer
a man's soul!"
The major's dismal reflections were
interrupted by a clear, ringing laugh.
Irresistibly he stopped by the seat of
the fresh-cheeked, tailored girl in the
wide hat, who had been variously min
istering to the hungry, cold, tired ear
ful. Now she had a youngster in her
lap, stifling his fretting with bites of
juicy orange. It looked inviting.
"I am sorry to say," came the con
ductor's voice from the doorway, "that
the drifts make it impossible for us
to go on. We have Bent for the plow
to release us. and it can probably get
here in two hours. As all trains after
8 o'clock are through expresses, the
station is closed for the night; so I
am afraid â "
A chorus of groans drowned the rest
of the announcement. Helplessly and
hopelessly they looked at each other.
The tailored girl alone, slipping the
child from her knees, held a moment's
consultation with the conductor. Then
she called cheerily:
"I am organizing a foraging expedi
tion. May 1 ask for volunteers, please?
Four men, I thinkâ young ones. We'll
let the rest of you help when we see
what's to be done."
The response was instantaneous. She
had to be firm In accepting the four
who had reached her first. Like a
captain, she managed her crew in un
disputed sway, and before the now
interested crowd could grow impa
tient they found themselves filing
through hastily shoveled paths into
the station's single j building, almost
warm already with a huge fire in the
stove.
"It wasn't a bit hard to get in,"
warbled the captain, now ' playing
Then came the dish washing ("Is
there anything that girl won't think
of?" wondered the major) and a round
of lively games, upon which broke the
welcoming shriek of the snowplow.
And how the winter night was rent
with cheer upon cheer for the captain
as once again they boarded the tra'a
with a fair passage ahead.
The major, by force, _ captured the
seat beside her.
"We can't begin to thank you, of
course. It was a case of salvation, pure
and simple. And that stewâ perfectly
delicious! If I might ask you to ac
cept my card â "
As she took the bit of pasteboard she
started and flushed; then, with a flut
tering apology, was off to adjust the
wraps of an old lady who was trying
to ; get a nap. And when, at the first
stop she left the train, escorted by a
bodyguard six or eight- strong, with a
musical "Good-by, everybody â and bon
voyage!" over her shoulder, the major
felt that his advances had not been
warmly received. .
'During the two days which the major
and his son, who had gone ahead, spent
over the business which had called
them from home the younger man
found his patience tried by the Inces
sant allusions to "the girl who saved
our lives."
"A girl like that. Warren, would make
a wife worth having I Capable to the
last degree! None of your esthetic
ethics about' her. -What you can see In
that college "creation you're so deter
mined.toâ" :,.
"If you please, father, remember that
I am engaged to marry Miss Berkeley,
and \ cannot .countenance slighting re
marks even from you. If you would
only consent to see her you would not
feel so, I know." . ;
"Well, well, never' mind! But a girl
like that I would welcome as a daugh
ter," was the regretful response.
On the return trip, by daylight, the
major grew visibly excited as they
neared the town where the girl had
stopped. â¢ .
"I'll watch closely, Warren. If she
should, happen to be at the train I
could point her out."
"Yc â es," drawled Warren, absent
ly; then he started forward as the
train pulled In. "Marcla! Why, what
in the world â ?"
But his father was peering through
the window. "By Jove, there she is!
And she'sâ noâ yesâ she's getting on!
Don't be excited. Warren, if you can
help it."
And the major turned to see his
dignified son dashing down the aisle:
then he held his breath as he saw him
warmly greet the angel of the mid
night feast
"Father, this is Miss Berkeleyâ
Marcia," began /Warren, persuasively;
when, to his surprise, the maiden said:
"I have met your father before,
though Major . Blackburn did not at
the time know me."
Father and son gazed from each other
to the girl. Comprehension dawned
simultaneously. Then the major put
out both hands, with laughter in his
eyes. Â¦
"But, Marcla," questioned Warren,
as they seated themselves, "I don't
understand yet. Why are you away
from the university?"
"Three days' leave of absence for ex
perimental sociology."
"Marcia," said the major, admira
tion and wonder controlling his voice,
"that stew! I didn't know college girls
ever did such things."
"My tomato-bisque?" she laughed.
"I am famous for that in my chafing
dish, and found just the right things."
"Tomato!" gasped the Major, sinking
back weakly. "That wasn't tomato?
Iâ Iâ guess I never tried any before. It
â¢was very nice."

JL in the millionaire class she
had been plain Tilly and the days
when she went to the county fair and
wore white organdie with blue rib
bons were marked in her calendar
with a large black mark. Matilda's
parer.t on her father's side was cele
brated for the number of worldly
goods that he did not possess. When
he felt like it and wasn't busy saving
the Government he gave a weak imi
tltlon of a man working for a living,
but most of the time it was Matilda's
mother who kept the wolf at arm's
length. Tilly's early occupation was
dallying with a clothes wringer and
holding up one end of a large basket
Friday night when It came time to de
liver the goods. In other words, Til
ly's mother took in washing, and all
because she had been taken in by
Tilly's father.
Having landed on the wrong side of
the money herself, that good lady
took pains to Impress upon her
daughter the fact that it was not only
ungenteel, but also very inconvenient
to support yourself and a husband
with an adult appetite into the bar
rain. Therefore Tilly determined that
Â¦when she had arrived at years of mat
rimonial discretion she would look
around for a long while before she
finally settled down in any particular
nest for keeps. The parental roost
â¢was preferable to any nest that she
had to maintain by her own unaided
efforts. Now it must be known that
Matilda was a long way from being
the worst looking piece of humanity
that ever inhabited a shirt waist. Not
only was. she possessed of the usual
number of features and general attri
butes of the ordinary human being,
but these members were distributed
over her face and person in such a
manner as to secure the best possible
results from the standpoint of a stu
dent of the human form divine.
It follows as a matter of course that
Matilda had the usual number of op
portunities opened to her for entering
Into the matrimonial state. Some men
think that the only way that they can
show their appreciation of a hand
some woman is by asking her to mar
ry them. It's something like testify

we nave intimated, had her own Ideas
as to what constitutes a happy home
and was determined that nothing

the savings bank game; if it was true.
as she had heard, that money talked,
she was determined to hear It speak
up good and loud before she died.
In Justification of Matilda It can
only be said that if money does tallc
for ordinary people It stood on Its
hind legs and fairly yelled for her.
If one of her neighbors gave a thou
sand-dollar luncheon. Matilda counter
ed with a dinner party where each
guest walked oft with a gold-mounted
tooth brush as a souvenir. When she
went to the theater nothing would do
for her but a whole tier of boxes, with
special attendants to serve champagne
between the acts. She could grve the
whole millionaire class points en the
best way to keep your money from
getting rusty and what she didn't
know about the number of things that
could be and were done to her hus

worth any one's trouble to find out.
. Some of the dames whose fore
fathers had walked over In advance of
the Mayflower and were waiting on
Plymouth Rock with a brass band and
an address of welcome were inclined
to think that Mrs. Neucolgn waa
dreadfully vulgar, doncheknaw, and
were for giving her the marble heart
and the chilly mitt and the other com
modities dispensed in polite society for
the purpose of showing you how much
below the average you are â In Income.
That was where they were foolishâ
not knowing Matilda. When she
heard that a bunch of Daughters of
the Revolution were after her with
their tomahawks she simply laid her
self out to make them look like a lot
of. circuit chasers. If one of the bunch
gave a dinner Matilda was right after
her the next night with a spread that
made the dame's look like a free
lunch; as a result Matilda's affair got
half a column, while the dame's waa
let down for half a stick. Every time
they tried to cross her bows she
blanketed them and sent them off on
the other tack looking for a fresh
breeze. Matilda never had any trouble
raising the wind whenever she
wanted it.
The general outcome was that even
the people whose ancestors had been
hanged by Oliver Cromwell had to ad

able to put-up a family tree that

front would do for her.
In the course of time and summei
boarders Matilda got her eye on a
young millionaire, who wore his brain
in a Psyche knot and drove a yellow
automobile with red trimmings. He
had had the good sense to select a
father who could make money faster
than three ordinary men could spend
it, and when the old man died he had
his son carefully salted away beyond
ell fear of want, with a guardian and
three trustees sitting on the lid to see
that he didn't throw any of the coin at
the little birdsâ or the cold bottles. To

FABLES FOR THE FOOLISH
{"T^HREE weeks ago, traveling on
t the underground railway, I met a
I manâ he was one of the saddest
JL looking men I have seen for years.
I used to know him well tn the old days
when we were Journalists together. I
asked him in a sympathetic tone how
things were going with him. I expected
that his response would be a flood of
tears and that in the end I should have
to fork out a fiver. To my astonish
ment, his answer was that things were
going exceedingly well with him. I did
r.ct want to say to him bluntly, "Then
what has happened to you to make you
look like a mute at a temperance
funeral?" I said. "And how are all at
home?" I thought that if the trouble
lay there he would take the opportu
nity. It brightened him somewhat, the
necessslty of replying to the question.
It appeared that his wife was in the
best of health. "You remember her,"
tÂ« continued with a smile; "wonderful
spirits, always cheerful, nothing seems
to put her out. not evenâ" He ended
the sentence abruptly -with a sigh. His
mother-in-law, I learned from further
talk with him, had died since I had last
met him and had left them a com
fortable little addition to their Income.
His eldest daughter was engaged to be
married. "It Is entirely a love match,"
he explained; "and he is such a dear,
good fellow that # l should not have
made any objection even had he been
poor. But, of course, as it is, I am
naturally all the more content." The
boy, having won the Mottle scholar
ehlp, was going up to Cambridge In the
autumn. His own health, he told me.
had greatly improved, and a novel he
had written in his leisure time prom
ised to be one of the successes of the
season. Then it was that I spoke
plainly.
"If I am opening a wound too pain
ful to be touched," I said, "tell me.
If, on the contrary, it is an ordinary
sort of trouble upon which the sym
pathy may fall as a balm, let me
hear it."
"So far as I am concerned," he re
plied, "I should be glad to tell you.
Speaking about it does me good, and
may leadâ so I am always in hopes â
to an idea. But, for your own sake,
if you take my advice, you will not
press me."
"How can It affect me?" I asked. "It
is nothing to do with me, is it?
"It need have nothing to do with
you," he answered, "if you are sensible
enough to keep out of It. If I tell you.
from this tiaie onward It will be your
trouble also. Anyhow, this is what
has happened in four other separate
cases. If you like to be the fifth and
complete the half-dozen of us you are
welcome. But, remember, I have
varied you."
"What has It done to the other five?"
I demanded.
"It has changed them from cheerful,
companionable persons into gloomy,
one-fided bores." he told me. "They
think of but one thing, they talk of but
one thing, they dream of but one
thing. Instead of geitlng over It as
time goes on, it takes possession of
them more and more. There are men,
of course, who would be unaffected by
itâ who could shake it off. I warn you :
against it in particular, because, be
cause, in spite of all that is said, I
am convinced you have a sense of
humor; and that being so, it will lay
hold of you. It will plague you night
and day. You see what it has made
of me. Three months ago a lady inter
viewer described me as of a sunny
temperament. 1/ you know your own
business you will get out at the next
station and take care to avoid me for
the next six months."
I wish now I had taken his advice.
As it was I allowed my curiosity to
take possession of men and begged
him to explain. And he did so. "It
was Just about Christmas time," he
told me. "We were discussing the
Drury Lane pantomime â some three or
four of us-^-in the smoking-room - of
the Devonshire Club, and young Gould
said he thought it would prove a mis
take, the introduction of a subject
like the fiscal question into the story
of 'Humpty Dumpty.* The two things,
so far as he could see, had nothing
to do with one another. He added
that he entertained a real regard for
Mr. Dan Leno, whom he had once met
on a steamboat, but that there were
other topics upon which he would
prefer to seek a gentleman's guidance.
Nettleship, on the other hand, de
clared that he had no sympathy with
the argument that artists should never
intrude upon public affairs. The actor
was a fellow citizen with the rest of
us. He said that, whether one agreed
with their conclusions or not, one
must admit that the nation owed a
debt of gratitude to Mrs. Brown Potter
and to Miss Olga Nethersole for giving
to it the benefit of their convictions.
He had talked with both ladies In pri
vate on the subject and was convinced
they knew nearly as much about it as
did most people. Burnslde, who was
one of the party, contended, that if
sides were to be taken, a pantomime
should surely advocate the free-food
cause, seeing it was a form of enter
tainment supposed to appeal primarily
to the tastes of the Little Englander.
Then I came into the discussion. The
fiscal question, I said. Is on everybody's
tongue. Such being the case, it is fit
and proper it should be referred to in
our annual pantomime, which has
come to be regarded as a review of the
year's doings. But it should not have
been dealt with from the political
standpoint. The proper attitude to
have assumed toward it was that of
innocent raillery, free from trace of
partianship. Old Johnson had strolled
up and was standing behind us. "The
very thing I have been trying to get
hold of for weeks,' he said, 'a bright,
amusing resume of the whole problem
that ehall give offense to neither side.
You know our paper,* he continued;
'we steer clear of politics, but, at the
same time, try to keep up to date; it
is not always easy. The treatment of
the subject, on the lines yon suggest.
la . Just what we require. I do wish
you would write me something.* He Is
a good, old sort. Johnson; it seemed
an easy thing; I said I would. Since Â¦
that time I have been thinking how to
do it. An a matter of fact. I have not
thought of much els*. Maybe you
can suggest something?"
"I was feeling In a good working mood,
and next morning "Pilson," said I to
myself, "shall have the benefit of this.
He does not need anything boisterously
funny. A few playfully witty remarks
en the subject will be the ideal." I lit
a pipe and sat down to think. At half
past twelve, having to write some let
ters before going out to lunch, I dis
missed tha fiscal question from my
mind. But not for long. It worried
me all the afternoon. I thought, may
be, something would com* to ma in
the evening 1 . I wasted all that evening
and I wasted all the following morn-
Ing. Everything has Its amusing tide.
I told myself. Jokes by the- hundred
are built on sudden death. One turns
out comic stories about funerals, about
weddings. Hardly a misfortune that
can happen to mankind but has pro
duced Its comlo literature. An Ameri
can friend of mineâ W. A. Alden. if I
am not committing a breach of confi
denceâonce took a contract from tha
editor of an Insurance Journal to write
four humorous stories. One was to
deal with an earthquake, the second
with a cyclone, the third with a flood
and the fourth with a thunderstorm.
And more amusing stories I have never
read. What is the matter with this
fiscal question? I myself have written
lightly on bimetallism. Home Rule we
used to be merry over in the eighties.
I remember one delightful evening at
the Codger's Hall. It would have been
more delightful still but for a raw
boned Irishman, who rose , toward
eleven o'clock and requested to be in
formed if any other speaker was wish
ful to make any more Jokes on the
subject of ould Ireland, because, if so.
the raw-boned gentleman was prepar
ed to save time by waiting and deal
ing with them altogether. But if not.
thenâ so the raw-boned gentleman an
nouncedâhis Intention was to go for
the last speaker and the last speaker
but two at once and without further
warning. No other humorist rising,
the raw-boned gentleman proceeded to
make good his threat, with the result
that the fun degenerated somewhat.
Even on the Boer war we used to
whisper Jokes to one another, in quiet
places. In this fiscal question there
mast be fun. Where Is it?
For days I thought of little else. My
laundressâ as we call them in the Tem
pleânoticed my trouble. "Mrs. Wil
kins," I confessed, "I am trying
to think of something Innocently
amusing to say on the fiscal
question." "I have heard about
It," she said, "but I don't have
much time to read the papers. They
want to make us pay more for our
food, don't the"y?" "For some of It, *
I explained. "But then, we shall pay
less for other things, so that really
we shan't be paying more at all.
"There don't seem to be much in it,
either way," was Mrs. Wilkins* opin
ion. "Just so," I agreed, "that is the
advantage of the system. It will cost
nobody anything, and result in every-
Exchange.)
body being better off." "Tha pity Is,"
said Mrs. Wilkins, "that nobody ever
thought of It before." â¢ "The whole
trouble . hitherto," I explained, "has
been the foreigner." "Ah," said Mrs.
"Wllkins, "I never heard much good of
him, though they do say the Almighty
has a use for almost everything."
"These foreigners," I. continued? "these
Germans and Americans, they dump
things on us, you know." "What's
that?" demanded Mrs. Wilkins.
"What's dump?" ""Well, it's dumping.
you know. You take things and you
dump them down." "But what things?
How do they do it?" ""Why. all sorts of
things: Pig iron, bacon, door mats â
everything. They bring them over
here in ships, you understand, and
then, if you please. Just dump them
down upon our shores." "You don't
mean surely to tell me that they Just
throw them out and leave them there?"
queried Mrs. Wilkins. "Of course not."
I replied; "when I say tfiey dump these
things upon our shores, that is a figure
of speech. What I mean is they sell
them to us." "But why do we buy
them, if wÂ© don't want them?" asked
Mrs. Wilkins. "We're not bound to
buy them, are we?" "It Is their art
fulness," I explained; "these Germans
and Americansâ and the others, they
are all Just as bad as one an
otherâthey Insist on selling us
these things at less price than
they cost to make." "It seems a bit
Billy of them, don't it?" thought Mrs.
Wilkins; "I suppose being foreigners,
poor things, they ain't naturally got
much sense." "It does seem silly of
them, if you look at it In that way."
I admitted; "but what we have got to
consider is. the injury It is doing us."
"Don't eee how it can do us much
harm." argued Mrs. Wilkins; "seems a
bit of luck, so far as we are concerned.
There's a few more things they'd be
welcome to dump round my way." "I
don't seem to be putting this thing
quite in the right light to you. Mrs.
Wilkins," I confessed; "It is a long ar
gument, and you might not be able to
follow it: but you must take It as a
fact now generally admitted, that the
cheaper you buy things the sooner your
money goes. By allowing the foreigner
to sell us all these things at about half
the cost price, he is getting richer
every day and we are getting poorer.
Unless we, as a country. Insist on pay
ing at least twenty per cent more for
everything we want it is calculated
that In a very few years England won't
have a penny left." "Sounds a bit
topsy turvy," suggested Mrs. Wilkins.
"It may sound so," I answered: "but
I fear there can be no doubt of it. Tha
board of trade . returns would seem to
prove it conclusively." "Well God bÂ«
praised, we've found It out In time.'"
ejaculated Mrs. Wilkins piously. "It is
a matter of congratulation," I agreed;
"the difficulty is that a good many
other people say that far from being
ruined, we are doing very well Indeed,
and are growing richer every year."
"But how can they Bay that," argued
Mrs. Wilkins. "when, as you tell me,
those trade returns prove Just, the op
posite?" "Well, they say the same,
Mrs. Wilkins, that the Board of Trade
returns prove Just the opposite."
"Well, they can't both be right." said
Mrs. Wilkins. "You would be sur
prised, Mrs. Wilkins," I said, "how
many things can be proved from Board
of Trade returns." But I have not yet
thought of that article for Pilson.

Most of the Americans who have ta
ken establishments in Curzon street
lately have done so for the season. The
price of a furnished house there is now
about ten or fifteen thousand dollars
for the so-called "season," which
means three months, and the tenant
has to pay the full term whether he
stays that long or not.' Servants are

two grocers' shops; while exactly be
hind the imposing residence, and evi
dently to be regarded from its back
windows, are a reeking little saloon and
a house which seems entirely given
up to "cheap lodgings."
The Marlboroughs, however, have the
satisfaction, if it is any to them, that
all the nearby houses on the same side
of the street also have the slum at
their back doors and hitherto Ameri
cans more than any other possible ten
ants of these houses have objected to
this strongly.
"How could I possibly take and live
in a house that looks out upon a duck
yard?" an American woman scornfully
asked the real estate agent who was
showing her over one of these resi
dences not long ago. Of course, the
reply to such an objection is. "Well, if
It Is good enough for the Marlbor
oughs," etc.
However, In Epite of the slums and
the shops, land values have Increased

Tradesmen's carts are racing up to
the kitchen entrance all day long, and
huge baskets of meat and vegetables
are being lowered down the great stone
stairs. The wine cellar is receiving
special attention, and when it is fully
stocked It will be one of the best equip
ped cellars in London. The presence of
such a' number of liveried servants
about the new residence has enhanced
the tone and dignity of the whole
neighborhood, and the little local
tradesmen are counting on making
their fortunes. The new house and the
distinguished-looking servants have
obscured everything which had hith
erto been looked upon with a certain
amount of local pride and interest.
Everything in the new "palace," as it
is locally described, will be new with
the exception of some antique stuff,
which is stored away at Blenheim.
Some family pictures and military

beyond this the furnishing will be new

LONDON. "July 3.â Lady Curxon : ' Is
the latest of the American society wo
men in London to take to motoring.
She has been whizzing about from Deal
to the other seaside places in the vicin
ity of Walmer Castle (of which her
husband is now master) during the
past week and exploring all the inter
esting spots. It was only on the advice
of her physician that she rejected cy
cling for motoring. Since the birth of
her latest baby she has been in a deli
cate state of health and it was ex
plained to her that the exertion of
cycling would have to be abandoned for
some time. She loved her brougham and
horses and maintained that if the cycle
was to have a rest they would supply
all she wanted In the way of outdoor
exercise. But her mother Insisted that
she must be in the\ fashion and
straightway provided her wtih a car at
her own expense. It cost 510,000 r.nd is
one of the most luxurious vehicles in
London. It is capable of maintaining
a speed of twenty-five miles an hour
and can seat four persons comfortably
in addition to a chauffeur.
Mr. ard Mrs. A. W. Bright of New
Yi.-rk have arrived in London and are
staying at Claridge's HoteL Mr. and
Mrs. Bright will remain in London for
a bripf time only, as they have planned
to make a Ion? tour on the Continent
in Mr. Bright's sixty-hor3epower
Mercedes car. There are only three
cars of this description in existence.
The Brights' travels will be principally
in Italy. Venice being one of Oxs flnt
cities they will visit.
Our Rome correspondent reports
that the Pope has received In privata
audience Mr. and Mrs. Mason . of San
Francisco, who were presented by
Monsignor Patrick Ludden. Bishop of
Syracuse, and by Mgr. Thomas Ken
nedy of Philadelphia, rector of the
American College in Rome.
Mrs. Christopher Magee of Pittsburg
has left her magnificent villa in Rome
for an automobile tour with her
cousin. Mr?. Steward, in North Italy
ard France. Her house ia one of the
most favored by the American colony
of Rome and by the aristocracy, being,
above all. a rendezvous for lovers of
music.
Count Ward has arrived in London
after enjoying a Continental motor
tour. He has been looking around for
a town house for the season, but could
not see why Americans should be ex
ploited by grasping landlords, so he
has decided Co put up at one of the
West End hotel?. He has already
commenced to entertain on a lavish
scale and it is understood that he will
be one of the '"lion" hosts of the sea
son. The King's personal friends-
Mr, and Mr?. Edward Sassoon and the
Countess of Lutzow â shared his hos
pitality recently. A few days pre
viously Georgiana. Countess of Galld

lunched with him. He afterward
treated them to a motor drive through
Richmond Park and out to Hampton
Court. - V
Mr. and Mrs. Parmalee Prentlcw
have been looking over the fashion
able real estate agents' lists since their
recent arrival in London. They would
not say. however, that they had any
intention of setting up immediately a
London establishment. All that could
be gathered from them was that they
desired to know the rents of houses
to let In the fashionable quarters.
Mayfair and Belgravia particularly.
"When the agents learned that Mrs.
Prentice was a daughter of John I>.
Rockefeller they immediately pictured
to themselves a mansion In Park lanÂ«
or Curzon street surpassing in size
and appointments even the Marlbor
ough mansion. After having given the
agent3 a good "shaking up" with re
gard to rents and grotfnd values. Mr.
and Mrs. Prentice proceeded in a mo
tor through some of the most fash
ionable streets, taking notes as they
went along of houses "to let."
Robert H. McConnlck of Chicago and
his charming young -wife, who were In
Rome all the winter months, have
left for France. Mr, McCormlck was
in bad health when he arrived, but la
now said to have quite recovered and
has gone to meet hi3 father for an
automobile trip.
"Burre-Jcmes Is also receiving' much
American patronage. Mr. Phelps-
Stokes and his sister, who have just
returned from Eg; pt, are to give him
a sitting before they return home in
July, so also will Marcus S. Mayer and
Albert H. Canby. both of whom have
come to London for the season.
The principal drawback to Curzon
street as a place of residence for the
aristocratic, however. Is the fact that
it is sprin:-:3d with stables and unlm
poslngr little shops, and that one side of
it is cheek-by-Jo W. - *h an out-and
out slum. The number of these small
business premises strikes one as soon
as he g^ts into Curzcn street. Where
fashionable Clarges street crosses it.
there are four of themâ a cheese deal
er's, a small livery stable, a grocer's
shop and a saloon, "the York Arms."
Result â when, the other day, the
Dowager Duchess of Marlborough
brought a party of American friends
in motor cars to go over Sunderland
House, the whole street was crowded
with gaping grocers' clerks and other
shop assistants, whose idea it was that
"Mr. Vanderbilt" had come to take
possession of his house, the name of
Consuelo's father, oddly enough, being
much more familiarly Identified with
the mansion in the neighborhood than
that of the Duke himself.
And, sad to say, Sunderland House
backs directly upon Curzon street's
slum. Just before one gets to the Marl
borough palace, going up the street,
there is a sort of dingy archway, and
passing through this one finds himself
in a dirty little square which calls Itself
"Shepherd's Market." and which is
filled with small shops and dwellings
that, from the look of them, might be
in the center of Whitechapel or Bethnal
Greenâ anywhere but Just off the street
where reside the Earl of Crewe; Kath
arine, Lady Letchmere, who is known
as the most exclusive of London
hostesses; the Earl and Dowager
Countess Howe, Lady Mary Foley and
goodness knows how many other titled
folk. It seems that this section of the
neighborhood was leased long ago for
a hundred years or more, and that is
why It will be impossible for a long
time to come to get rid of all the little
rookeriesâ a goodly number of which
are "pubs." as they call the cheaper
sort of saloon over here.
DUKES HUMBLE NEIGHBORS.
Behind Shepherd's Market there are
"mews" and more shops and it is on
following the small street which sep
arates them that one discovers how the
place completely surrounds Sunderland
House on every side but one. and what
a democratic lot of neighbors the ex
clusive Duke and Duchess have. On
one side of the aristocratic mansion are
the shops of a boot-mender, a green
grocer and a clockmaVar; on the other
CABBAGES AND KINGS.
Were it not fc- its reputation as one
of the most stylish streets In London,
the future Fifth avenue of Mayfair
might be described as quite "impossi
ble"â at any rate as a place of resi
dence for the exclusive. Besides being
crooked and narrow, it is awkward to
get at. To enter it from Berkeley
Square you would hnve to dive down
a flight of steps and then thread a
narrow passagewayâ Lansdowne Pas
sage, it is calledâ with brick walls on
either side and so gloomy that on dark
days it has to be lighted with big gas
lamps. And the shortest way Into Cur
zon street from Park lane is up a flight
cf steps and through r-'..her rather
forbidding passageway that is marked
âat the Curzon-street endâ "To Park
Lane and Pitt's Head Mews"; "mews."
of course, being nothing more aristo
cratic than stables.
folk have beenâwilling to- follow-:- so
illustrious a lead by locating in the
street where Thackeray's heroine
queened it and where Disraeli died.
No one who knows Curzon street wili
wonder that the Marlboroughs would
have preferred almost any other fash
ionable street in London in which to
build their new palace. The wonder

It was pluck, pure and simple, or
perhaps it would be better to say ne
cessity, that led the ducal couple of
Marlborough to decide upon Curzon
street as the site of Sunderland House,
or "Blunderland House" as the place
got nicknamed during its construction
en account of the many mistakes made
by the builders in following the elab
orate plans furnished them. True, the
present site was suggested to the Duke
and Duchess in the first place, but
it was not until Belgravia and Mayfair
had been vainly ransacke. by them in
search of a better location that it was
finally decided to build on St. One of
the drawbacks about the site was that
it was occupied at the timeâ this was
in 1S33â by Curzon-street Chapel, an
uncommonly fashionable little church
Â¦which cost the Marlboroughs many
thousands of dollar.- to have pulled

have built the most magnificent private
residence in London, and undoubtedly
it Is the presence there of Sunderland
House, as the impressive pile Is called,
that has led practically every rich
American who has taken a house in
London this season to try to locate
cither in or near the street where, ac
cording to Thackeray, Becky Sharp
abode at the height of her social career
in London. The Bradley-Martins and
Mrs. Adair. it will be remembered, have
been in Curzon street for some time,

Girl â fully as Important a person In Ja
pan as in America â who loves to sit
in the theater as long as possible and
weep over the play. For. to the gen

the place for weeping. Japanese girls
are extremely sentimental, and a play
without harrowing situations would not
appeal to them in the least. The mu
sical comedyâ as presented in America

Japanese women are passionately do
voted to the drama. It la usual for a
party to book a box through a tea
house connected with the theater and
at the same time make arrangements
for what refreshments they wish
served. The Japanese maiden makes
the most elaborate preparations days
beforehand, and when the eve of the
eventful day arrives, she has been
known to sit up all night so as not to
oversleep herself the next morning. To
be at the theater on time, playgoers
must rise with the sun. and all their

not an easy task to reach one's seat*,
and once the family has settled down,
nothing but a catastrophe would in
duce it to leave its box. They eat in
it, smoke in it, nurse babies in It. and
put themselves thoroughly at their
ease. In each box there is a small
stove, at which they light the short
Japanese pipe, and at their side is the
plate of rice and fish with the tradi
tional chop sticks, and a bottle of sake
(rice brandy) and cups of tea. which
are filled as often as emptied. The
women chew candy and the men par
take freely of sake as the play goes

Yone Noguchl. the Japanese poet,
well known locally through his inter
esting Anglo-Japanese verse, con
tributes to the Theater Magazine for
July a fascinating article on "Theaters
and Theater-Going in Japan." He says
in part:
"Modern Japan, despite its ready
adoption of western manners is in
things theatrical still faithful to the
ancient feudal days, and the san
guinary, interminable dramas written
many centuries ago are still the chief
attractions in the Mikado's theaters. It
is true that within the last few years â
in fact, since the triumphant European
and American tours of those distin
guished Japanese players, Sada Yacco
and Oto Kawakamiâ the old school
drama has to some extent lost ground,
and quite recently performances of
Shakespeare's 'Othello* and 'Hamlet*
and Daudet's 'Sappho* have been re
ceived with favor by Tokio audiences.
The explanation of this curious sur
vival of the old form of play at a time
when all Japan Is eagerly imitating the
foreigner is undoubtedly to be found
In the peculiar customs of the country.
The progressive Japanese finds it easier
to change his mode of dress than to re
form habits bred in the bone. The old
plays, lasting as they formerly did from
early morning until nearly midnight,
just suited the Japanese playgoer, who
when he does go to the theater makes
an all-day affair of It. Indeed, theater
going in Japan is a very serious mat
ter, like an ocean voyage or long rail
road journey with the American, and
not to be entered upon lightly or with
out due preparation. Some ten or twelve
years ago the Japanese police limited
the duration of a dramatic performance
to eight hours, and more recently Sada
Yaqco and Oto Kawakami. who learned
a good deal in their foreign travels, in
troduced the comparatively short even
ing performance of three or four hours,

"Perhaps you have never 6een It

"Perhaps notâ I have not in fact."
"But about the restâ now that we

"What about Beatrice?"

that ridiculous for a tall thing like

"Nell G Wynnes and things?"

"And about Shakespeare?"
"Do you think so? I am so glad,"
the girl cried, laughing and blushing
with pleasure. She Is as admirably na
tural off the stage as on. Miss Raw-

again then to explain: "That's my
hobby. I'm crazy about voices. That
is what I notice first, last and all the
time with actors. I used to study w*Uh
a singing teacher in Chicago â just for
the speaking voice â "
"They're the same," I interjected.
"And every time we heard of any
thing new in the use of a voice we used
to discuss it, try it. Reeves-Smith has
a fine voice â all English people seem to
have. He says it is the climate. I
think it must be. I remember going to

"Beautiful!" the chorus at the other
end of the lounge agreed.

Mrs. Campbell's voice that so amazed
me. There was a tiny, frail girl play
ing with her â looked as though a
breeze would blow her away. But
when she came to speak! There was
the same great, beautiful voice, and
they all had it. I said to myself in de-
Epair, 'It's English,' but I went back
just the same to my studies, deep
breathing and the rest."
"Bravo!" I said, ( and after asked how
long she had been on the stage.
"Four years." she confessed, and
then with a sly gleam in her soft blue
eyes repeated: "Four years, and not
a star yet!"
"And what do we want to do?" I
queried, after telling her that I saw
no reason why she should not be a
star some day. *V .
"Yes." she nodded brightly. "I learn

you know, I couldn't even hear that I

and trouble I used to have with it â
"here." 'Heah' is something like, but
what a 'heerrre' I used to give it."
"Did Mr. Reeves-Smith teach you
how to use your voice?â may I say it is
a very charming one?"
"Accounts for what?" Miss Rawson
inquired. Then she laughed, "Oh, my
accent. Yes, I know. It's better than
it was, though."
"But why didn't they tell you about
it at college?"
"I suppose they didn't notice it â

were unusually lucky in having them

evening. She leaned over them then In
a forlorn hope, but was unrewarded
by the smallest sizzle.

in the ensemble shiver and laugh that
followed Miss Rawson and I suddenly
' became friends.
Then from an inner room â the
Rawsons' is a bijou suite of three â
came a voice and a suggestion: "Let
me mako you some coffee."
â¢Oh. do!" Miss Rawson cried, and
as the owner of the voice came in
she presented me to "mamma."
A prettier contrast than the two
would be difficult to find. Tall they
both are, graceful and slender, but
there the resemblance ends. Like
mme oid French miniature is Mrs.
Rawfon, with her delicately precise
coiffure. ca.ineo-like skin, charmingly
dimpled about the mouth, with her
brilliant black eyes. Miss Rawson's
eyes are the "violet blue" that John
Dunsmure claimed for his last week.
Miss Rawson's hair is strong gold,
blowing where it listeth, and instead
of the mother's clear white, all the
rose tints linger on the daughter's
cheek. Perhaps they both own the
meaningful chin that the younger
lady wears, below a little mouth fitted*
with teeth even and white as young
corn â I don't remember. But mother
had asked about coffee, and daughter
and I both echoed joyfully "coffee!"
As Mrs. Rawson left us for the tiny
toy kitchen that "belongs" to the
suite it is to be owned that we talked
of the weather. Tou couldn't help it.
It imposed itself, it was the one bit
ter, nipping fact of the day. Miss
Rawson was so surprised to "find it
like this." I told her with gelid
patriotism that "it wasn't often like
this. She "hoped it wasn't." She had
come from Illinois and I could "imag
ine the difference." I could, but sug
gested It might be "pleasanter to be
irozen alive than broiled." She "did
rot know." But they got only five
minutes* sunshine a day in their rooms
â like truth these are at the bottom of
ia "well"â and perhaps that made a dif
ference. I thought it did, but it was'
*o difficult to get just what one want
ed near town. They had really not ex
pected to bÂ« here this summer.
"No?" I queried.
"So," Miss Rawson said, clamping
her hands over her knees, as I find she
has a way of doing. "I was with
Rr-eves-Smith in 'An African Million
sire.' and we thought the play would
run all summer. I had planned to
ftay in New York for the season, in
fact. It ran a week!"
"It's a way they have," I said from
my vast experience.
"I thought the play good," the girl
avowed with a frank laugh. "I give it
up now. I don't know a bad play from
a good one â on paper."
"Who art thou, to be wiser than the
manager?" I asked sternly.
Ah! the coffee!
Over it. hot and fragrant, we soon
decided that the day was not so bad
after all, and got to chat of Miss Raw

There has long been an analytical dis
cussion in London of the charm of the
American girl, and what do you sup
pose has been the deduction? Why,
her animation as expressed in gesticu
lation! Time was when even American
girlsâ particularly those of the rigid
schools of New Englandâ were taught
to preserve an icy exterior, with a well
bred immobility of feature in conver
sation. But the Creole maid, and her
vivacious sister of the South, with their
magnetism and spontaneity, were car
rying oft the honors of the social world,
and the Northern maid took notice.
And thus to-day is vivacity the keynote
of the charm of la belle Amerieaine
of North and South. So what think you
of a school established in London for
the purpose of teaching the uses in
conversation of the eyes and eye
brows, the facial muscles, and those
of fingers and the hand"
But all gesticulation that is not
prompted by thought always seems
forced and unfit. However, a habit
of animation may be cultivated by this
sort of instruction, and then the Im
pulses of the mind may be expressed
by natural gestures.
My! But what a relief it will be if

A pretty wedding occurred last "vreek,
when Miss Beatrice W. Robinson be

Church in Benicia. The bride and
groom are both of excellent families
and both with hosts of friends.
wretch of a maiden rightfully dragged,
to pay the penalty of having been
kissed, or at least having been sus
pected of it Or perhaps the shameless
thing has wandered off the porch of
sanctity and gone walking down the
lane with a man â a man who is not a
relative â and without a chaperone. Or
ft may be that the scarlet creature
permitted a married man â "a man with
a nice little wife at home"â to walk
with her down to the spring, or to the
lake, or the beach. Now. there's a case
that, were It not for the dear old
"tabbies," might have gone by un
noticed and uncondemned, and there
fore unpunished. To be sure the "nice
little wife at home." having heard the
sad. sad story, might have been spared
many tears and heartaches â which
were of course ridiculous and wholly
unreasonable, because the man and the
maid were simply pleasant acquaint
ances and, in all probability, would
never meet again. Hut for the best in
terests of the human family â which
the dear "tabbies" love devotedly â
these things must be brought to light.
And then there's the stunning young
matron, whose fond provider has sent
her away for recreation, that she may
store up a surplus of enthusiasm and
cood cheer, from which she may draw
when weariness bears her down. Now.
rfttime, she is the rightful object of
solicitation by the censors of morals
and manners at summer resorts, be
cause she will talk with men and dance
with them, and even with married
menâ and she has be'-* known even to
walk off into the' starlight with them.
Of course she would go with a party
of friends, but even then, such conduct
shocks a moral people, and well she
deserves the lorgnette-frappe that
greets her return.
So here's to the tabby â the preserva
line of public morals! And here's to
bÂ«*r rheumatism, that keeps her on the
porchâ may it never grow lessâ for the
fields and forests lie beyond, where the
men and maids may wander at will,
right-thinking and right-doing their
only monitor â and the only chaperone
necessary for the American girl prop
erly reared. And since it is the woman
who holds the gauge of the friendship
valve, the moral situation lies in her
hands. And therein It is eminently

announced that he would propose an

his seat amid loud cries of "Vote!

Senator. John Daniel, chairman of
Uip committee on resolutions, was
then rec'ognized to reply to Bryan. It
"Mr. Chairman â I think you will
bear me out In what I said. This is
the first time In the history of the
United States that a man already
nominated for the greatest office on
silence so deep, so Intense, that, not
withstanding his weakened voice, every
word was distinctly audible in all parts
of the hall. He then handed the tele
gram to Governor Vardaman, who,
after requesting absolute quiet, read
the telegram as follows:
"I regard the gold standard as firm

shall act accordingly if the action of

A ringing cheer went around the
hall, but It was brief, so anxious were
the delegates to see what would fol

The speaker asked Senator Tillman
to read the message that the leaders
had drawn up as a reply to Parker,
but there was a short delay, owing, to
the difficulty experienced by the Sen
ator in deciphering the handwriting
of Williams. The Senator asked for
quiet, saying that he had undergone
an operation on his throat and that
his voice had lost -"that nightingale
quality that it once possessed." He
then proposed to read the telegram.

PARKER'S MESSAGE THAT CAUSED A SENSATION
when Williams interrupted him with
the remark:
"Here is a typewritten copy."
"For which I thank Almighty God,"
retorted the Senator.
He then read the following message
to Judge Parker:
"The platform adopted by this con

monetary standard because it is not
regarded by us as a possible issue in
this campaign and only campaign is

that the motion be deferred until the

ST. LOUIS, July 9. â The conven

delegates and alternates were in their

mally call the convention to order, but
bjb soon as some degree of quiet had

Mississippi arose and without formal

of the mysterious telegram. The con

the surface of the earth has been so
supersensitive about a matter of per
sonal rectitude and personal honor as
to send a telegram asking a friend to
decline a nomination for him if, as he
seems to Have been informed, there
has been something in the platform
which is not in accord with his opin

"My friends, we purpose.ly made this
platform silent on" the question" of the
money standard, because we thought It
was not an issue in this campaign. (Ap
plause.) And we all agreed, further
more, that nothing should be placed in
the platform which was not a cam
paign issue, and the consequence was
that in the resolutions committee mo
tions were made to table, and those
motions were carried, every resolution
on both sides which tended to bring up
as an issue in this campaign the ques
tion of the monetary standard.
"Now, my friends, Judge Parker ex
presses his opinion, for fear somebody
might think that you did not know It.
There was not in all this vast assembly
one single man who did not already
know that Judge Parker was a gold

radical silver men In the United States,
and I knew that he was a gold standard
man, and he never made any attempt

This practically commits
the party to the gold stand

from the platform.
At 1 :30 o'clock the conven

ST. LOUIS, July 10.â The
Democratic National Con
vention at 12:30 o'clock,
by a vote of 774 to 191.
ordered the sending of
a reply to Judge Parkers
gold standard message con
taining these words:
There Is a strong suspicion among;
the opponents of cold that the Par
ker telegram was a trick to commit
the convention to Judge Parker's
views on finance. Sheehan never lost
the teleeram and never had .to make
it public If he desired it to be kept
secret. This telegram became public
property within an hour after It was
received, and even some of those who
worked and voted for Parker suspect
The committee on resolutions was
assembled and the proposition was to
write a new plank. The committee de
cided not to insert a new plank in the
platform, but to suggest that the con
vention, through Sheehan. send an an
swer to Parker stating that the money
question was settled and was not re
garded as an issue, that this was the
reason It had not been Inserted and
that Parker and the party were not at
variance. This was what was done to
night after hours of turmoil.
TRICKERY IS SUSPECTED.
These States did not want a reaf
firmation of the Chicago platform, but
they wanted no reference to gold and
there at once seemed to be some like
lihood that Parker would be taken at
his word and asked to step down.
RESPECT PARKER'S CANDOR.
There was started. . on the other
hand, a strong movement on the part
of Southern leaders to respect Par
ker's views and insert the gold plank
which Hill and Bryan had agreed to
leave out. The programme was helped
by the appreciation in the Southern
delegations of Parker's frankness and
candor in telling them before the con
vention adjourned, instead of waiting
until he wrote his letter of acceptance.

telegram was received the convention
was receiving names for the nomina

likely that Henry G. 'Davis of West

Judge Parker had been nominated
by the Democrats from Virginia.

ST. LOUIS, July 10.â After hours of
turmoil the Democratic convention at
an early hour this morning nominated
Henry G. Davis of West Virginia for
the Vice Presidency and adjourned sine

by acclamation after the first ballot
had shown that, as the choice of the
conservative leaders, opposition to
him would be futile.

subject, as they might desire him to

that his name be withdrawn if a ma

CAUSES CONSTERNATION 1 .
Special Dispatch to The CalL
BEARERS OF THE jrESSAGE.
John Share Williams, Governor Var
daman, Senator Tillman and Senator
Carmack made their way to the plat
form with the mysterious message in
their possession. A short conference
took place among the four and Chair
man Clark, while the delegates sang
"My Old Kentucky Home." Chairman
Clark pounded for order, with John S.
Williams standing by his side.
"I wish to announce in advance," said
the chairman, "that on this important
matter every man shall have a full and
fair hearing. I now introduce John
Sharp Williams of Mississippi."
Williams spoke as follows:
"Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen of the
Convention: All of us were very much
surprised and excited this afternoon,
to use no stronger words, at what pur
ported to be copies of telegrams which
had been sent by our nominee to Mr.
Carmack and others in this city. I want
to tell you that but one telegram has
been received. Mr. Carmack not only
received no telegram to-day of the
character that was published, but never
received a telegram from Mr. Parker In
his life. And nobody received a tele
gram containing the language in that
infamous volunteer production.
"A telegram has come from Mr. Park
er to Mr. Sheehan. however, which I
shall read In a moment, and It Is so im
portant that you should know what it
is that, after I have read It, I shall
hand It to mv friend, the Governor of
my State, Mr. Vardaman, and have
Mm read It over again. When you shall
have heard it you will note that there
is not in it one word about requiring or
demanding or asking or requesting that
anything should be placed in the Demo
cratic platform. (Loud applause.) ,
"You will also note that if there
Is any error in it at all \t Is an error
of judgment from a too sensitive spirit
of honor (applause) ; a too sensitive
wish not to be misunderstood or placed
in a false or in a double position. I
shall now ask Go'vernor Vardaman to
read the telegram to you." (Loud
cheering.) >
PARKER'S MESSAGE IS READ.
Williams' words were heard in a
and he repeated the Injunction at nu
merous intervals.
Bryan then arose and came to the
front of the stage. His face was pale
and drawn with illness. His voice was
weak and hoarse. He spoke with great
effort, but quietly and with self-control.
As the speaker went on his voice
grew stronger and clearer and as he
narrated the story of his effort to se
cure the insertion in the . platform of
a financial plank the flush cjf excitement
covered his face and his gestures be
came more frequent and more em
phatic.
His declaration that the sending of
the telegram to Judge Parker was a
declaration for the gold standard and
Instantly there was an uproar- Calls
of "Bryan." "Bryan," went up and the
galleries cheered. Bryan went to his
place in the pit, but as the cries of the
Nebraskan's name, coupled with the
words, "Platform, platform," con
tinued, Bryan made his way to the
stage.
His face was chalk-white. He walked
rapidly up the side aisle. His lips were
compressed to a thin line and his brows
were drawn straight. He nervously
fanned his face and paid no attention
to hands that were held out to him as
he passed. Senator Newlands of Ne
vada also went to the speakers* stand.
â¢ After a threat of the chairman to
clear the galleries, where most of the
disturbance came from, the noise
ceased.
Senator Tillman continued by saying
that if he understood the present tem
per of the delegates the threats of the
chair with reference to the galleries
would be carried out.
"Look out," shouted a voice.
"You look out, or you will be put
out," retorted Tillman, and instantly
the police seized the offending specta
tor and ejected him.
As the Senator concluded there was
a short-lived burst of applause, but it
was evident the delegates, were in no
mood to waste time in demonstrations.

ard after they had won their fight to prevent a declaration of the kind being inserted in the platform. After a bitter quarrel, lasting many hours, the convention by a vote of 774 to 191 practically indorsed Parker's stand by replying that
his financial views did not render him objectionable as the party leader.

the Parker sections men sat close to

7 o'clock there were signs to the ini

dramatic in the extreme, but the dele- v

Perkins of Illinois secured recogni

to read a telegram from the platform.
The telegram was from William R.

The reading was warmly applauded.
The telegram was as follows:
"A. M. Lawrence, St. Louis â I wish
to thank my friends for their unfalter

my appreciation of their loyalty by

Governor Dockery was recognized at
the conclusion of the prayer and read
a telegram from Senator Cockrell, as
follows:
We commend curselves to thy thought now,
asking that wisdom be sent down from above, j
Thou hast led this convention to the choice of i

midst of wrath thou didst remember mercy. |
and thou hart brought us out of confusion and ;
peril and hast held together this mighty natlcn, j
which only the omnipotent God could have j
wielded.
ST. LOUIS, July 9.â Chairman Clark
resumed the gavel to-day, and at 2:48
o'clock began his effort to call the con
vention to order. Before the formal
opening of the session the band was
signaled for a tune. The delegates be
gan to arrive, making too much con
fusion for the chairman to be heard.
The rumor of a recess had spread,
and every one was anxious to know
the proceedings. The delay continued,
however, waiting for word from the Vice
Presidential conference at the Southern
Hotel. The band was utilized for en
tertainment, and a rousing cheer as it
struck up "Dixie" followed.
Rev. Frank Johnston of the Delamar
Baptist Church was introduced and
pronounced the invocation. He said:
FORT "WAYNE. Ind., July 9.âWil
liam R. Hearst was a passenger on the
Pennsylvania limited to New York to
night. A number of telegrams were \
received by him at stations along the \
road. For some reason he alighted J

the fast train to Chicago to stop for |
him.
INDIANAPOLIS. July 9.â Congress- j
man Bourke Cockran of New York, on ;
hiE way home from the St. Louis con- !
vention, was Intercepted here to-night j
by a telegram from the New York dele- j
gation. Immediately he ordered the car j
detached from the train.
A special train Is now carrying him i
on his return to St. Louis.
"My friends, you have builded a por
tion of a ticket. You havejjqne to the
East for your President. Now come to
the West. You" men who listen to the
tickers on Wall street come across the
continent to the great Pacific slope and
to the State of Washington. The Pacific
Coast will be the battleground in the
next campaign. Rally round your lead
er. You men In the South have the
memories of the past binding you to
the Democratic party. You of the East
have the historic origin of our leaders.
We men in the West are building the
temple of Democracy, and the State of
Washington will produce the keynote,
and all the other Western States will
say it Is a perfect creation, 'f. From
across this great, great continent we
extend the hand of friendship to you
and place on the ticket as a running
mate for {he peerless, matchless citizen
of New York our own splendid friend
and citizen, the first citizen of the
State of Washington, ex-Senator George
A. Turner." (Applause.)
Connecticut yielded to Indiana, and
Delegate SDencer of Indiana seconded
the nomination 'of Williams.
RUMORS DISTURB GATHERING.
By this time the report that a tele-
ROLL. CALL. BEGINS.
The roll call of States was then called
for the presentation of candidates for
Vice President. Even at this time the
galleries were less than half-filled, and
great rows of vacant seats were visible.
Alabama was called several times, with
no response, but finally Russell of that
State announced that Alabama would
give way to Illinois. im ~
Samuel Alschuler of Illinois arose and
announced that Freeman B. Morris
would speak for that State.
Morris took the platform to name
James R. Williams of Illinois. Thanks
to the few people present, he was able
to do what no speaker before him had
been able to do, and that was to make
his voice audible to everybody in the
audience from his first word. Cheers
greeted the mention of Williams' name,
but they did not come in a great meas
ure from the delegates.
Colorado yielded to Washington, and
Chairman Clark recognized Frederick
R. Robinson of that State, who spoke
for George C. Turner. He spoke as fol
lows:
It was 5:37 o'clock when the first
sign of opening the session was man
ifested. Chairman Clark called the
convention to order and directed the
delegates to^take their seats. Repre
sentative John Sharp Williams of
Mississippi was recognized and moved
that nominating speeches should be
limited to fifteen minutes and second-
Ing speeches to five minutes, but
that no more than four seconding
speeches would be allowed for any
one nomination. Ball of Texas offered
a substitute limiting the nominating
speeches to ten minutes, leaving the
time for the seconding speeches at five
minutes and limiting the number to
three. Williams at once withdrew his
motion in favor the substitute and it
was adopted.
ST. LOUIS, July 9. â Chairman
Clark was in the Coliseum ten min
utes before the hour fixed for the con
vention to reconvene this afternoon.
Xot only were there many vacant
seats in the galleries, but a number of
absentees were noticed among the del
egates and alternates.
Outgoing trains to-day carried the
first batch of the departing convention
crowd and many delegates planned on
leaving for their homes to-night.
It was a close, muggy atmosphere
into which the crowd walked this af
ternoon. The setting sun poured in
on the west side of the hall and min- 1
gled unwillingly with the white glare
of the arc lights. The^ajority of the
delegates divested themselves of their
coats, folded them across their laps
and, seizing palmetto fans, flapped
them vigorously, listening to the
music and wondering how soon the
party leaders would reach an agree
ment on the Vice Presidential nomina
tion.
A report that an attempt might be
made to reopen the platform and in
sert a financial plank spread rapidly
in the hall. It- created consternation
among most of the delegates, who saw
an end to their hope of leaving St.
Louis to-night or early to-morrow.
Should such a coup be attempted Bry
an's collapse and consequent absence
was looked upon in some quarters as
lending color to the rumor and the
session opened with an evident air of
expectancy.
Shortly before the session con
vened the rumor that Davis of West
Virginia had been agreed upon by the
leaders for the Vice Presidency went
rapidly through the hall and delegate's
gathered in groups to discuss the sit
uation, i
His motion was put by the chair
man. The vote was, in the opinion
of most people. lost; 'but Chairman
Clark loudly banged his desk, declared
it carried and quickly left the platform
before the convention recovered from
itr "amazement.
The confusion, great before Culber
son rose, was intensified greatly
when he intimated that Judge Parker
might possibly vacate the head of the
ticket. As soon as the recess was an
nounced the delegates, instead of leav
ing the hall, rushed into conferences.
In an instant there were fully twenty
groups in the hall, in the center of
which were two or three very much
excited and gesticulating men, who
discussed the Parker telegram ve
hemently. The police asain and again
passed along the aisles endeavoring to
clear them, but the delegates refused
to move, and the excitement grew
rather than abated. A dense throng,
through which it was impossible to
pass, gathered in front of the chair
man's desk and strove desperately to
learn the exact import of the message.
Their efforts were unavailing, however.
The leaders disappeared and the ses
sion closed with an atmosphere tense
with' expectancy as to what would oc
cur/when It reconvened at 8:30 p. m.
The din and confusion continued
while the Senator was speaking and
he was cordially Invited both to "keep
on" and "sit down."
ing the convention, a recess be taken
until 8 o'clock. His motion did not pre
vail. The convention was in such an
uproar because of the Parker telegram
rumors that the latter part of the roll
call for the presentation of candidates
for Vice was inaudible.
Chairman Clark directed that the roll
be called fc-r the announcement of the
votes. Senator Culbertson of .Texas se
cured recognition. He was visibly ex
cited when he secured recognition and
mounting his chair, said:
"For reasons which are obvious to
all the delegates 'here, it seems to me
that we ought not to prc-ceed at this
time to nominate a candidate for Vice
President and I therefore move that
the convention â ,". here cries of
"Why?" "Why?" interrupted Senator
Culberson.
"I think the delegates understand
vhat I mean," he proceeded. Chair
man Clark interjected. "Proceed."
"And I repeat," cc-ncluded Culber
son, "that in the present exigencies
which confront the convention It ought
not to proceed to the nomination of a
Vice President."
"Right," "Right," greeted this state
ment. "We want to know before a.
candidate for Vire President is nom
inated who will be the candidate for
President." and cries of ap
proval again greeted the Senator.
When he could be heard he made his
motion for a recess until 8:30.

CONVENTION TAKES A RECESS.
A resolution expressing regreat ana
sympathy at the death of Delegate
Jacob E. Border of North Dakota. In
the train wreck at Litchfleld on July
3, was offered by the North Dakota
delegation and agreed to.
Russell of Alabama was on his feet
at once and remarked that on account
of the sad news the convention should
adopt appropriate resolutions, and, to
allow the members of the North Da
kota delegation time to, confer, he
moved that a recess be taken until 5:30
o'clock.
Â¦ Cries of "No," were heard from all
parts of the hall, but Chairman Clark
put the motion, when, a protest was
made that there had been no second.
"Is the motion seconded?" asked
Clark, and amid another general cry
"No, no," and a vigorous protest from
all over the hall, he put the question.
The. vote was overwhelmingly against
the recess, but Clark' declared with a
thump of his gavel that the motion
was carried and at 3:30 the convention
was declared In recess for two hours.

A canceled postage stamp bearing
the head of Washington is all that a
number of citizens in a Kentucky town
have to show for dollars which have
gone in answer to a cleverly written
advertisement in which this offer was
made: "To close out a slightly dam
aged lot of engravings originally issued
by the United States Government, . we
will 6end you a beautiful popular like
ness of Washington for 51." Perhaps
fifty persons thoughtlessly enclosed $1
and were caught. After considerable
delay each victim received a small en
velope containing a regularly Issued
canceled two-cent stamp, neatly
wrapped in wax paper. The stamp
may be the same one purchased at the
local postoffice and used in forwarding
the dollar to the schemer.â New York

Peril In Such Importations.
The ants discovered by the Agricult

said to feed on cotton boll weevils, and
which it is proposed to Import Into this
country may turn out to be as destruct

bits were thought. to be just the ani
mals wanted in Australia, and they
were carried there from England. In
a few years the Australian Government
was offering premiums to those who
would help abate the rabbit pest. The
English sparrow, that has driven the
scng birds out of cities and towns in
this country, is another Illustration of
an imported pest and nuisance. Gypsy
moths were imported into Massachu
setts for scientific purposes. A few of
them escaped and in a year or two the
State government had to inaugurate
a costly war of extermination against
them.â Savannah (Ga.) News.
BRYAN A SICK MAN.
Others of the Leaders Show the Ef
fects of the Jjong Strain.
ST. LOUIS. July 9. â There was no re
gret on the part of the delegates when
they completed their work to-day and
started for their homes to get sleep.
The strain of the past three days has
been the severest in the history of po
l'tical conventions, and it was begin
ning to tell upon many of the delegates,
especially the leaders, on whose should
ers has fallen the bulk of ttte commit
tee work.
William J. Bryan has already suffered
a temporary collapse. He left the hall
at 5:30 o'clock this morning, as soon as
the nomination of Parker was assured,
without waiting for the completion of
the call, and accompanied by his broth
er entrenched himself In his room at his
hotel, where he gave orders that he was
not to be disturbed under any circum
stances. In addition to the loss of sleep
he had undergone, amounting now to
nearly seventy-two consecutive hours,
he is troubled with a bad cold, and his
brother and his close friends are doing
all they can to force him to take some
rest. He was not at the afternoon ses
sion of the convention.
Senator Pettigrew of South Dakota
was among the few persons permitted
to see Bryan, and he made a brief call
upon him at 4 o'clock this afternoon.
After leaving Bryan's room the Senator
said that Bryan's bronchial tubes had
been badly affected and that two phy
sicians had been called In. They found
one of the lungs slightly affected, but
a change for the better had taken
place and the physicians expressed the
opinion that all danger had passed.
They ordered complete rest, however,
and Bryan will go to a place In the
country near here. He will not again
appear in the convention. Senator Pet
tigrew expressed the opinion that Bry
an would later define his attitude to
ward the Democratic ticket, but said
that he would not do so until he could
have time to give careful consi<*eratlon
to what he might say.
David B. Hill was late in arriving at
the hotel this afternoon, and even his
Joy at the success of his candidate did
not hide the fatigue and nervousness
which the long sessions of the resolu
tions committee and of the conven
tion and of the numerous caucuses in
which he was the leader have brought
upon him.
"I am feeling better. I have had
four hours' sleep." said Senator Till
man as he arrived at the Coliseum this
afternoon, but he found few of his con
freres who shared that v feeling with
him.
John Sharp Williams was used up
after his first session as temporary*
chairman and for the last two days
has been suffering from hoarseness.
Champ Clark, the permanent chair
man, at this afternoon's session was
unable to make himself heard beyond
the first four rows of seats, although
he keeps a cough drop in his mouth all
the time. He had his secretary make
the announcements for him through
the megaphone.
<There are only a few of the leaders
who show the strain of the last few
days, and it is the consensus of opinion
that this convention has established a
record for hard work and long hours.
TELLS STRANGE TALE
TO COUNTY CONSTABLE
Stranger Arrested at Sulsun Accounts
for Possession of Span of Mules
With Peculiar Yarn.
SUISUN, July 9. â A stranger giving
his name as Thomas McFarren and
claiming Rutherford, Napa County, as
his home, drove into town yesterday
with a fine span of mules hitched to a
new spring wagon. He drove to a
livery stable and ordered the team
cared for. Constable Dawning learned
that McFarren had offered the team
and wagon for sale for $300 and at
once placed the man under arrest
pending investigation. When ques
tioned the stranger said while walking
along the road a few days ago near
Winters a stranger driving the team
overtook him and asked him to ride
with him. When they reached Vaca
ville the driver turned the team over
to McFarren and told him to drive It
one day south and put the rig in a
livery stable. The driver, claims Mc-
Farren, said his name was Wilbur and
that he hailed from Portland, Or.
The constable is of the opinion that
the team is stolen property.
Â«aa then 11 o'clock and there were
zigr.s that the trouble would pass.
Bryan's speech and that of Senator
Tillman had been listened to attentive
ly. When applause was given there
was no disposition to prolong it. The
deleg-ates were evidently in a business
like frame of mind and determined to
adjust and close the incident that had
been so dramaticaly injected into the
situation.
Senator Daniel was recognized, but
bad spoken only a few words when a
delegate from Arkansas said that he
could hear nothing because of the
noise enr.or.g the delegates and after
some conversation between him and
the chairman the later directed that if
the delegates made any trouble the
police should "Take two or three of
them out and it will do them good."
Senator Daniel concluded at .11:17.
His speech was received with hearty
applause from the pit, where the dele
gates were seated.
J. B. V.'eaver of Iowa, who twelve
years ago was the Presidential nom
inee of the Populist party, next spoke,
being recognized amid calls of "Vote!"
"Vote!" from all over the hall. It was,
he said, an optical delusion to suppose
Parker to be a foot higher than on
yesterday. The illusion ivas caused by
the convention beir.s three feet lower.
To send the telegram was equivalent to
faying "All right, Judge; anything
you want we will accede to."
Weaver punned the name of the
place from where Judge Parker sent
his telegram.
"It is spelled 'Esopus,' " he said, "but
it ought to read 'E-Soup-Us.' "
Vociferous cries of "Question!"
"Question!" "Vote!" followed. The
chair recognized Charles S. Hamlin of
Massachusetts, who urged the sending
of the telegram to Judge Parker.
FIERCE CLAMOK FOR A VOTE.
Afl Hamlin fcnished it was evident
that the delegates were heartily sick
of listening to speeches and were rap
idly losing temper over the constant
succession of speakers who mounted
the platform, and they clamored fierce
ly for a vote; but Chairman CiarlT, true
to his promise that every man should
have a fair show, recognized Senator
Ctrrr.ack of Tennessee.
Carmack declared that Bryan had
â¢eid that the nomination of Parker
would be declaration enough on the
money plank.
"Mr. Chairman," said Bryan, rising
hastily, "I beg the gentleman's pardon,
but I never said that."
John S. WillLairs supported Bryan
in hi<= statement, and Senator Carmack
accepted the correction. The Senator
took occasion to deny that he had ever
received a message from Judge Par
ker, and the chair recognized Bryan,
who presented an amendment to the
reply cf Jud^e Parker as follows:
"But as you will, if elected, be called
upon to act upon certain phases of the
money question, we would like to know
v/hethtr you favor reducing the volume
of silver dollars, whether you favor an
asset currency and branch national
banks, whether you prefer national
bcr.k currency to United States notes."
Bryan then proceeded to answer some
of the statements made by those who
Continued From Pace 21, Column 6.
"God forbid," ejaculated Richmond
Hobson in a loud voice just behind
the speaker. In explanation of his own
attitude on the absence of a financial
plank in the platform, he remarked
of the money question:
"If it is in a trance it will awake, but
if it Is dead I do not want the corpse
in my parlor."
Taking up the question of the reply
to Parker Williams read the first sen
tence.
" "The platform adopted by this con
vention Is silent on the money ques
tion? Does any one deny that â even
Bryan?" asked Williams. "Then take
the next sentence," ho said. " 'Because
it is not regarded by us as a political
issue.' Does any one in this hall deny
that? If there is any one on the floor
of this convention who believes that
the money question Is any Issue in this
campaign let him arise in his place."
Not a delegate arose.
"Now let any one on thÂ« platform
who believes the money question an.
issue arise." Q
As he said* this "Williams turned to
Bryan. But Bryan kept his seat.
Cries of "Question, question," came
so fast that confusion reigned for some
minutes. In the confusion an effort
was made to make an adjournment
motion. This was ruled out of order.
Bryan sprang to his feet and declared
that his delegation was going to sup
port the candidate that New York
wanted for Vice President and If It
would conduce to harmony he would
withdraw his amendment to the reply.
"I am going to withdraw this amend
ment," said Bryan. "Our delegation
will vote for the candidate for Vice
President that New York wants. We
are not going to do one thing to mar
the harmony of the convention."
A roar of applause followed the an*
nouncement.
After some debate a roll call was or
dered on the question of the adoption
of the Williams reply to Judge Par
ker's message to Sheehan.
As the roll call proceeded It was evi
dent that the motion to send the mes
sage to Judge Parker would be carried
by an overwhelming^ majority. The re
sult was announced' to be 744 ayes, 191
noes, and the message was ordered sent
had followed his first address. Great
applause followed his assertion that
lack of harmony In the party could not
be laid at his door.
Senator Carmack undertook to cor
rect a statement made by Bryan as to
the proceedings In the committee on
resolutions and a short debate fol
lowed between the gentlemen, with the
result that neither satisfied the other
as to who possessed the better memory.
ONLY TWO WAYS OCT.
The speaker woke the galleries to
enthusiasm when he declared that he
had expressed a willingness to support
a gold standard man to build up har
mony in the party and again when
he declared that he believed the adop
tion of the gold standard would defeat
the party In the impending campaign.
There were only two ways out of the
difficulty Into which the action of
Judge Parker had plunged the party.
One was to amend the message In the
manner he had suggested and the other
was to amend the platform by the in
sertion of a gold plank.
Leaning far over the rail In front
of the platform, he shook his hand at
the New York delegation and said:
"I will agree to adopt Senator Car
mack's plank. Will that satisfy the
friends of Judge Parker?"
It was five minutes after midnight
v. - hen Bryan concluded and Repre
sentative John Sharp Williams arose.
He plunged without preface Into a
scathing arraignment of Bryan. Turn
ing from time to time he faced Bryan,
who sat with immobile countenance
and fanned himself. His voice trem
bling, Williams declared that Bryan
had presented the spectacle of a man
pleading for harmony, when In all this
great convention his had been the only
voice of discord. The amendments to
the Parker telegram, he characterized
as a "lot of foolish questions." He
spoke satirically, with biting humor
and great earnestness.
In explaining that the telegram from
Judge Parker was simply an expres
sion of the Judge's own Individual
opinion, Williams suddenly wheeled,
and facing those on the platform,
asked: "Suppose we had nominated
Bryan on this platform?"

An interesting investigation now be
ing carried on in Florida by the bureau
of fisheries has for its object the dis
covery and development of methods by
which the valuable sheepswool sponge
may be cultivated artificially.
The method which promises the most
satisfactory results is that of using
cuttings. Large sheepswool sponges
are cut into small pieces, which are
fastened to an Insulated wire fixed in
the water, so that the sponges are sup
ported a few inches above the bottom.
These small bits, placed at close in
tervals along the 'wire, soon heal and
form an organic attachment to it and
very soon begin to grow. It is toosoon
to" predict Just what the results will be,
but the indications are so far very en
couraging and it is believed that the
time Is not far distant when the sponge
fisheries of Florida will be vastly In
creased in productiveness and value.â

Married Women as WaRe-Karners.
The American prejudice against
wage-earning by married women ap
pears in the effort occasionally made
to make the employment of teachers
in the public schools terminate with
marriage. But thousands of Ameri
can married women do earn wages,
thousands more would gladly do so if
they could, and other thousands would
be happier and better off if they did.
The prejudice against it seems disad
vantageous. American men, as a rule,
prefer to support their wives, if they
can. If an American married woman
works for pay it is either because it
gives her pleasure or because her hus
band's income ' is insufficient. She
does not do it as a matter of course.
How long she can keep it up depends
upon what the work is and upon other
circumstances. If she has children
that, of course, interferes with her
wage-earning if it does not stop it al
together, and general ar of
the custom which would restrict or
discourage child Bearing is not to the
public advantage. Marriage tends,
and should tend, to withdraw women
from wage-earningj, but it need not
stop it per so and abruptly. To make
marriage a bar to future wage/earn
ing by a woman operates in restriction
of marriage, and that is at least as
much against public policy as re
striction as child bearing. â Harper's
Weekly.

One of the most singular lakes in the
world is the celebrated Pitch Lake of
the Island of Trinidad. This lake
spreads over an area of 99 acres, and
its surface is composed of one great
floating mass of asphaltum, seamed
with veins of clear water. From it and
a similar lake asphalt Is drawn.
The Pitch Lake is a hideous place as
far as smells are concerned, for the
air all about it Is heavy with. noxious
vapors, and from the center of the lake
gushes a fountain of liquid asphaltum,
in which there float and break bubbles
containing most horrible gases.
The workmen go out on the surface
of this lake and cut great slabs of as
phaltum, which are carried away. But
the next morning the hole they left
is filled up again with the pitch which
has risen during tha night, so that the
supply seems inexhaustible.
This curious lake was discovered by
Sir Walter Raleigh when he landed in
Trinidad in 1595, on his way to the
mouth of the Orinoco in search of El
Dorado.
Another strange lake is situated on a
peninsula which Juts out into the Cas
pian Sea. The whole surface of this
lake is covered with a crust of salt
so thick and strong that a man can
ride across it on horseback with safety.
In Central Asia, near the Caspian
Sea, is a lake of beautiful rose color,
while the banks are covered with salt
crystals as white as snow. From the
waters of this lake there arises a flow
er-like odor. \The color and the odor
are supposed to be caused by the veg
etable matter in the depths. '.
There used to be a curious lake on
the top of the Volcano de Agua, in
Guatemala, 14,000 feet above the level
of the sea. It was not fed by springs
nor by rivers, but was caused by the
accumulations of snow and rainâ in
fact, was an immense reservoir. It
lasted for centuries. Then, one day,
the sides of the lake gave way, and
down the waters rolled, dealing death
and destruction and digging a great
barranca, or ravine, in the mountain
side, which is still visible.â Baltimore

MILL VALLEY, July 9.â M. V.
Lewis, one of the proprietors of the
Hotel Madrona, disappeared last Tues
day morning and his partner, Fred
Schuter. is mourning the loss of a
considerable sum of money. Schuter
had absolute confidence In his partner
and never thought to examine the
books. Schuter Is now of the opinion
that Lewis did not pay bills they
owed, but Instead pocketed the money.
-Very little Is known of Lewis. He
first came to Mill Valley about three
years ago and succeeded In getting
emplojTnent at the Hotel Madrona.
Schuter liked him from the start and
a few months later took him into
partnership. Lewis had no money at
the time, but borrowed $300 and had
Schuter indorse his note. It is pre
sumed that Lewis took the money last
Monday night. He was seen by the
head waiter at about 9 o'clock leaning
over the safe. The room was dimly
lighted at the time, but nothing was
thought of the incident. Tuesday
morning Lewis did not put in a*n ap
pearance and Schuter became suspi
cious. He opened the safe and dis
covered that all the money was gone.
The exact amount taken by Lewis
is not yet known. Schuter has an ex
pert examining the books, but they
are badly tangled.

ROME, July 9.â Very -unfavorable

The so-called "brain fag" is a silly
myth. The brain does not tire; intel
lectual work does not hurt under nor
mal coniitions. It Is eye strain that
causes all the brain fag which the
newspapers have been exploiting of
late. Spencer learned this lesson, arid
escaped the tragedy of Neitzche and
Carlyle by dictating his writings, get
ting others to do his research work for
him, and by being willing to go with
out vast realms of accurate knowledge.
Parkman was driven to similar expe
dients. But all the rest groaned and
suffered even while they wrote little
notes *nd x>ostal cards instead of let
ters to Their best friends.â Booklover.
If we examine carefully the biogra
phies and letters of the fourteen gen
iuses Jsut nientlond. it will be found
that they all suffered in much the same
way. They had headache, sick head
ache, dyspepsia, nervousness, inde
scribable misery, irritability, insomnia
and dejection. Moreover, all of them
learned every day that the use of their
eyes in their occupations caused these
symptoms, and that the only cure was
non-use of the eyes in such work.
If you grlance through the biogra
phies of any twenty-five great literary
workers you will find a strange and
striking difference between the per
fconal lives of perhaps half of the num
ber and of the others. Twelve or fif
teen will be found to be comparatively
healthy, -while the others are constantly
afflicted, and endure lives of intense
suffering. Of this class are George
Eliot, Huxley, De Quincy, the Carlyles,
Parkman, Browning. Wagner, Spen
cer, Whlttier, Margaret Fuller, Lewes,
Darwin and Xietzche.

Is Generally the Cause, of Break'

A SILLY POPULAR MYTH
LOS ANGELES. July 9.â A physical
and mental wreck and suffering from a
disease for which there la no cure
known to medical science, his body
emaciated to ruch a degree that h'.s
friends would not know him, Lawrence
llar>y. once the handsomest man on
the . American stage, escaped from his
curse at the Sisters* Hospital "and an
hour later was a prisoner at police
headstt&rters. His arrest followed what
at the time was supposed to have been
a determined attempt on the* part of
the actor to commit suicide.
Hanley Is afflicted with tuberculosis,
end the doctors eay he has not long
to live. For years he has been a user
of morphine, and during the past year
his appetite for the drug has been bo
great that his daily portion at times
exceeded thirty grains. For weeks he
had been confined at the Sisters' Hos
pital, where, during the periods of his
delirium, he lived over again his tri
umphs on tfie Etage.
This afternoon he entered a drug
store at First and Main streets and
purchased 25 centE* worth of morphine,
telling the druggist not to wrap it up.
When the poison was handed him he
declared his intention of talcing all of
itâ fifty grains. Just as he raised it
to his lips the drug clerk struck his
hand and part of the poison was spilled.
Hariley took what remained and then
in a rage demanded more morphine,
eaj-ins he wanted enough to end his
troubles. A oolieernan was called and
he was taken to the Receiving Hos
pitrj, where he became violent. After
a time he was returned to the Sisters'
Hospital. The Doison had no serious
effect upon him.
Uar.ley has entered into a contract
to appear next month in a magnificent
production at St. Louis, in which
many American stars will take part.
He has also contracted to appear on a
tour with Mme. Modjeska; but those
with v.hom he has made these con
tracts know nothing of his condition,
ted the doctors state he will never
again appear before an audience.

LONDON, July 9.â Latest informa
tion points to the conclusion that only
one boatload of survivors- of the
wrecked Danish steamer Norge was
picked up "yesterday. A dispatch from
Leith, Scotland, says that nineteen
survivors had been, landed at * Thor
haven, Faroe Islands. A dispatch from
Glasgow saying that a boat containing
eleven passengers, eight i sailors and
one child had reached Shetland Islands,
probably' referred Iothe same boat.
The second officer of the Norge, ;who
landed at Thorhaven, says that on the
night of, June 30 his boat sighted, a
large steamer and that he made all the
signals in his power, but his boat was
not obs'erved. All hands then lost hope.
For five days thereafter storms, fog,
sunshine and Â¦ calm were the only
changes in the monotonous wait for
death. Both bread and water gave out.
On the morning of July 6 land was
sighted, but the efforts of those in the
boat to reach it were unavailing. Later

Although Tarpey had proposed and
demanded until turned down by bal
lots that the California delegation

mit the ri^ht of the California dele
gation to tie him to any one or sug
gest for whom he should vote. The

Later in the day it was said that
Fome of the northern men favored
giving Tarpey the complimentary vote
for Vice President, but this suggestion
split the delegation into two factions
of wildly differing ideas. The result
of the wrangle was that when the del
egation met this afternoon it decided
to forego the pleasure of naming a
California man for Vice President and
to plant its standard beside that of
West Virginia in its fight to nominate
H. G. Davis. Tarpey again Jumped the
traces when the delegation sought to
tie him down to Tom Taggart of In
diana for chairman of the National
Committee.
Tarpey was in this amaible frame of
mind when he was approached by the
south of Tehachapi delegates with a
proposition to give James H. Budd
the complimentary vote of California
for Vice President. Tarpey didn't
care to hear the scheme. In hia opin
ion California had already gained a
large sufficiency of prominence if not
notoriety in the convention. Again
Tarpey was npt quite sure that all of
the Californians would be willing to
give Budd the complimentary vote'. It
is conceded that in this Tarpey should
be the best judge, at least so far as
one vote is concerned.
TARPEY DISTURBED.
HEADQUARTERS CALIFORNIA
DELEGATION. ST. LOUIS. July 9. â
Contention is marking the last hours
of the official existence of the Califor
nia delegation. The anger of M. F.
Tarpey over the easy manner in which
the Parker forces disposed of his op
position may be responsible for this
condition. One thing is certain. The
jewel of consistency has ever glittered
from the banner of the Californlans.
They have quarreled without cessa
tion. No rifts of peace have appeared
In the black clouds of strife. With
true Democratic love of contest they
have kept woe's caldron bubbling.
At 6 o'clock this morning after the
defeat of Hearst had been recorded,
Tarpey said:
â¢The odds against us wÂ«re too great
to be overcome, but we enjoyed the
friendship of Bryan throughout the
fight and this is a source of great sat
isfaction. He is the greatest man in
America and it is better to go down
to defeat with him than to go to vic
tory against him. A lot of these polit
ical lice that opposed us will soon
meet their reward, I hope. These ver
min that oppose principle and betray
trust cannot run the country. The
people will prevent them."
To-night the headquarters of the Cal
ifornia delegation are in darkness. The
banners and flags and glassware have
been packed and the delegates are ar
ranging to depart or seek quarters
nearer the fair grounds. M. F. Tarpey
of Alameda and his son, A. B. Tarpey,
will visit the fair for a week or so and
then go East, returning home by way
of the Canadian Pacific. D. M. Delmas
of Mountain View will go to Cincinnati
after taking in the. sights of the expo
sition. D. W. Carmichael of Sacra
mento will leave In a few days for Chi
cago, and from there he will go to At
lanta, returning to the coast in a month
or so. Joseph Simons of Los Angeles
will enjoy the exposition for a week
and will then return v home. R. H. de
Witt of Treka has decided to remain
here two -weeks and then return home
by .way of New Orleans. A. j. McSor

to New York and then to Boston, ac
companied by his mother and sister.
J. B. Sanford of Ukiah will remain

tors. 30 per cent of them women, re
mained until the nomination was
made.
Mr. Bryan left the convention hall
a few minutes before the nomination
was made unanimous, but not before
he knew that Judge Parker was nomi
nated. To several correspondents, who
were waiting at his hotel, he said that
he had nothing to add to what he had
said in the, convention, which was that
he would support any candidate nomi
nated on the platform he had assisted
in making.
"I have not*slept for hours," he said.
"Good night.'.'
Â¦ It may be added that those of a
superstitious turn of mind may be en
couraged by the fact that Judge Par
ker was not nominated on Friday.
After the close* of the convention
many of the figures prominent in the
contest were surrounded "by friends
and heartily congratulated. Notable
among these were. David" B. Hill of
New York, who had been in actual
charge of Judge Parker's campaign.
He laughed and cried alternately.
, In a section of the hall sat Mrs. Hall,
daughter of Judge Parker. With a
party of friends she remained through
out the night. She showed her happi
ness with tears.
William F/Sheehan, who hasdone
the personal work for Judge Parker,
and August Belmont were jubilant
over the : result. One of the' most in
teresting phases of the convention was
the. fact that although early evening
was succeeded by darkness
by dawn and dawnÂ» by rbrdad 'sunlight,
at least two-thirds of all the specta-
The convention took. a recess yester
day until 8 o'clock last^, night for the
purpose of receiving the report of the
committee on resolutions. The report
was received and adopted by a viva
voce vote. Ko far as the surface indi
cations were concerned, there was no
more opposition to the platform than
there had been to that adopted unani
mously by the ltepublican convention
in Chicago a few weeks ago. Nomina
tions were immediately proceeded with.
Alabama yielded to New York, and
Judge Parker's name was the first
presented to the convention. After that
Hearst, Gray, Cockrell, Wall, Wil
liams, Olney and Miles were named In
speeches which nearly took the entire
night. In the end all the claims bf the
Parker forces were proved accurate.
Parker had within a few votes of
enough to nominate, and these ' were
forthcoming. The speeches which had
been cheered so long and loud had
neither made nor lost a vote. The Par
ker fofces, under perfect control, re
mained serene. After the nomination
had bpen m fide the convention ad
journed until 2 o'clock to-dayl .
HTLL. LAUGHS AND CRIES. Â¦
The thousands of cheering persons
apparently converted Bryan to the be
lief that Senator Cockretl's chances of
nomination were greater than any
other favorite son candidate. The Ne
braskan gained recognition soon after
the Cockrell demonstration and in a
Bpeech directed undoubtedly in an ef
fort to defeat Parker, made his electri
fying plea for the anti-Parker forces
to rally. He was given the closest at
tention. The great convention which
the police and sergeant at arms were
powerless to control, livened as though
. every word was a personal message to
each person â as if . a hypnotic spell
had been cast over the throng. But
when it was all over the Parker forces
had not been shaken. The ballot for
President gave Parker C58 votes out
of the 667 needed to nominate, and be
fore the result could be announced
Idaho, Nevada, Washington and others
made changes to the Parker column.
Governor Dockery of Missouri moved
to make the nomination unanimous,
and. it carried amid cheers. The re
sult of the ballot was never announced
officially, and It is not likely that It
ever will' be. ;;.: -..
One of the. features of the long drawn
out session has been the beautiful
tribute paid" to Senator Cockrell when
his name was placed in nomination by
Representative Champ Clark. It was a
spontaneous* outburst, and for that rea
son the more complimentary to the
Senator. The delegates, already weary
by reason of the tedious and trying
session, paused in their labors and In
the guise of a nomination for the Presi
dency, which the Senator's . friends
knew to be beyond his reach, indulged
in a demonstration continuing about
half, an hour. Nearly every delegate
and spectator in the galleries or on the
floor had been provided with a flag,
and the scene was far theVnost im
pressive of all the ovations given dur
ing the session.
BRYAN'S VAIN EFFORT.
ST. LOUIS, . July 9.â Judge Alton B.
Parker of the New York State Court of
Appeals was nominated at 5:45 o'clock
thlsf morning for President of the
United States by the Democratic Na
tional Convention. Only one rorf call
ensued, and so decisive was the result
of that onÂ© that contrary States began
to call for recognition, and the ballot
finally resulted in a unanimous vote for
the New York State man, The scene
was dramatie In the extreme. Darkness
had ..witnessed the gathering of the
Democratic hosts, while broad daylight,
the sun paling the electric light, wit
nessed thÂ© dose.
The convention .was in session from 8
o'clock last night until nearly 6 o'clock
this moaning. In that time eight names
were presented to the convention.
Nominating and seconding speeches In
numerable were made, and as dawn ap
proached it became* necessary to limit
the seconding speeches to four minutes
each. An exception was made in the
case of William Jennings Bryan, who
In one of the most dramatic situations
ever witnessed in a political gathering
addressed the convention and conclud
ed by seconding the nomination of Sen
ator Francis M..Cockrell, the "favorlta
son" candidate from Missouri. Bryan
received the third great ovation ac
corded during the convention. 'His
speech was an Impassioned appeal to

LOS ANGELES, July 9. â Frank P.
Flint, former Unite'd States District
Attorney and politically prominent
throughout this end of the State, has
announced himself as a candidate for
the United States Senate to succeed
Senator Thomas R. Bard. The an
nouncement is the result of the ef
forts by a number of more or less
prominent politicians to induce Flint
to become a candidate. In the for
mal announcement which he made to
day he recites the fact that he has
been ' importuned tb\ become a candi
date and after duly considering the
matter he has decided to make the
race. In his anouncement he says:
"I will make every honorable effort
to obtain the support not only of the
members of the Legislature from
Southern California, but I expect to
address the Republicans of the entire
State and endeavor to convince them
that Southern California is entitled to
have a Senator from the south and
that I am worthy of their favorable
consideration.
"In making this announcement I
deem it proper to say that during the
last two years I have been employed
by the Southern Pacific Company in
general legal business, but in Justice
to myself and my client I have this
day notified the' officers of that com
pany that as they have large Interests

relations that have existed between us,
owing to my candidacy, and that I
will not accept any employment with
that corporation or with any other
corporation or Individual having any
business, directly or Indirectly, with

"This means that I sever my con
nection not only with the Southern

other clients. It will thus be appar
ent that in announcing my candidacy
for United States Senator I am taking
the necessary actions to' carry into ef
fect the spirit of the law and to pro

of this great State, whom I hope
faithfully and honestly to represent in
the United. States Senate and by my
acts try to maintain the confidence
and esteem not only of those men who
have asked me to be a candidate, but
of all the people of California."
The first political office ever held by
Davis was that of member of House of
Delegates in 1865. He was next elected
State Senator, serving from 1867 to
1869. He. was elected to the United
States Senate to succeed W. T. "Wiley,
Republican, and took hia seat March
4, 1871, and served until March 4, 1S83,
declining re-election. Davis has been
a delegate to six national conventions,
including ones in New York in 1868 and
in Baltimore in 1872.
"When the delegates to the Pan-
American Congress were selected Davis
was made one of them. He is a mem
ber of the Intercontinental Railway
Commission. ../.v
In 185S Davis began the business of
banking and mining coal In and around
Piedmont and became one of the most
successful business men and capitalists
in his home State. He projected and
carried on to success the "West Virginia
Central and Plttsburg Railroad, of
which road he is president.
Davis ls the largest Individual coal

station agent at Piedmont, which is
now his home.
The Lieutenant Governorship of his
State is said to have been offered to
him more than once, but if it was he
declined it, preferring to stick to his
chosen profession, the bar or bench. In
1891 he was tendered the nomination
for Governor of New York by a num
ber of gentlemen who represented the
several wings of the Democratic party
In his State, but he declined.
Many other opportunities were of
fered to him for place In State or na
tional administration, high up, at that,
but he always stuck to his choice of
early manhood, and contented himself
with the best his own State offered in
his own particular line.
Democratic national convention which
nominated Grover Cleveland; to which
end he contributed In no small degree.
DECLINES HIGH PLACE.
His larger debut may be said to have
been made In 1S73, when hc> organized
the district and elected his friend. Judge
Schoonmaker. as State Senator. His
own election a* Surrogate two years
later drew to him the attention of the
big men of the day, Tilden, Manning.
Lamont and others, ard his ability and
popularity were noted for. use when
occasion required.
; In 1ES3 he entered a wider field of
irerk and influence as a delegate to the
Judge Parker from the attainment of
his majority began to take an active in
terest In politics, and aside from the
campaigns in which he was the proba
b!e beneficiary, had a hand In most of
the fights made on local. State or na
tional issues.
FOXD OF POLITICS.
In 1S37 he was nominated by the
Democratic party for the office of Chief
Justice cf the Court of Appeals, the
highest Judicial position In the State of
New York, and was seated at the head
of the bench by a majority of over 60 -
009. when the State had gone for Mc-
Klnley the year before by 212,000.
Jufige Parker off the bench is a
farmer and takes much pleasure In
turning the soil that Is to receive the
seed and prow the grain needed on his
place. He was married October 16 1873
to Miss Mary L. Sc'hoonmaker. the
daughter of his friend and partner
Judge Augustus Schoonmaker of
Kingston. N. Y. His family now con
elsts only of himself and wife, but his
aged mother Is a frequent visitor to his
fireside, and his daughter Bertha, wife
of Rev. Charles M. Hall of Kingston,
N. Y.. with her two children, also
spends a good part of her time there
His brother. Fred W. Parker. Is 'in the
Insurance business In New York City
VETVS GREAT VICTORY.
In that year he was appointed by
Governor Flower a member of the
general term of the first department
of the Court of Appeals, where he con
tinued until 1ES5, when appellate divi
elona were adopted under the new con
stitution.
When he was but 25 years of ape he
was elected Surrogate of Ulster
County, after a hard political fight, in
which he was the only one of his ticket
to reach success. Six years later (1S83)
he was re-elected with Increased ma
jority, and two years later he was ap
pointed Justice of the Supreme Court
of New York, to fill the vacancy caused
by the death of the Hon. T. R. West
brook. He entered at once upon the
duties of the office for the current year,
at the end of which he was elected
Justice for the full term. In January,
1SS9. the second division of the Court
of Appeals was created and Judge Par
ker was appointed to a seat on that
bench, being the youngest member that
ever 6at In the Court of Appeals in the
State of New York. That position he
held until the dissolution of the court
In 1S32.
On the conipleion of his term at Al
bany In 1S72 he was admitted to prac
tice at the bar. Settling at Kingston,
he became first a clerk and then an as
sociate in the firm of Sehoonmaker &
Hardenburg, the leading law firm of
that section.
After the high school, at the age of
16. he began teaching at Virgil, N. Y.,
and taught for four years with great
success, his aim being to earn the
money to carry him through the nor
mal school. This done, he taught at
Rochester . for a time and earned the
money to take the two years' course
at the Albany Law School. He had
decided, when only 13 years old, after
listening to a celebrated lawyer speak
at hi3 County Courthouse, to follow
the legal profession.
EXTERS THE LAW.
When he was nine years of age he
began attending the winter sessions of
the district school, helping about the
fanr* when not so engaged, and in his
thirteenth year entered the Cortland
Academy, the same at which Daniel S.
Lamont received his collegiate prepar
ation.
CAREER OF ACHIEVEMENTS.
Alton Brooks Parker was bora in the
old homestead May 14. 1S52, and so is
now in his fifty-third year, the very
prime cf vigorous and useful man
hood.
Alton Brooks Parker, who has been
chosen to lead the Democratic hosts In
the ballot battle to be fought at the

by every line of title, of pre-revolu
tionary 6tock on both sides of his
house. His ancestors came from Eng
land, to Massachusetts in the early
settlement days and helped make good
the advance of civilization on the
western hemisphere.
His great-grandfather, John Parker,
was born at Worcester, Mass., in 1751.
He left his farm fn 1776, entered "Wash
ington's army as a private and served
throughout the whole war. One of his
Eons, JohD second, Jn 1S03 moved to
New York and bought a farm at Cort
land, which farm to-day is in posses
elon of his grandson, Alton Brooks
Parker, the subject of this sketch. John
Parker was a man of high education,
creat intelligence and broad public
epirit. His son, John third, who be
came the head cf the family on his
death, imbibed his father's love of
learning and though not financially
able to give his chltaren all the advan
tages In educational lines that he de
sired, did succeed in implanting in
their bosoms a burning desire to ac
quire learning. Of the value of this
parental care, his son Alton is to-day

Hopes for Son's Election If Best Thing
for the Country.
DERBY, Conn., July 9. â The news
of Judge Parker's nomination was
brought to Mrs. Parker, mother of the
Democratic nominee, to-day by a rep
resentative of the press. Tears came
to her eyes and for a moment she
could not speak. She said:
"I had hoped, if his nomination
would be the best thing for the party,
that he would be nominated, and
now," she said, "if his election - will
be the best thing for the country, I
sincerely hope that he will be elected."
She said that Judge Parker was a
personal friend of President Roosevelt
"Is that so?" replied the Judge, his
ruddy face breaking into a cheery
smile, in which satisfaction was undis
guised. He asked for details of the
final vote and displayed the liveliest
interest in every fact and figure, at the
same time refraining from the slight
est comment. When asked If he would
say anything concerning his nomina
tion, he replied: Â¦
"No, I shall say nothing , whatever
until. I. am formally notified of my
nomination."
He climbed up the steep bank to his
house and cordially received the greet
ings of the other newspaper men who
had, been. waiting there, but again de
clined to make 'any comment upon the
'situation.
', . From 9:45 o'clock last night until
after 6 : o^clock this morning judge
Parker remained In his room; which
he left only to go to the river for his
usual' swim. At' that time he knew

balloting had begun. There is little
doubt that Judge Parker had been
confident for many days that he would

no surprise, unless, perhaps, in some

B. Bekavac, pastor of the SL Nicho

narrowly escaped injury and perhaps
death at the hands of several hundred
infuriated men and women last night.
Through efforts of the police, who
guarded the entrance to the priest's
domicile, the storming of the house
was prevented and the crowd finally
dispersed.
' . The trouble was started by a mem
ber of the church making the allega
tion that the pastor's fees for officiat

threaten that they will tear down the
church if Bishop Phelan decides to re

ST. LOUIS, July 8.â Senator David
B. Hill Bald to-day concerning the nom
ination of Parker:
"Of course, I am delighted with the
result, and the more so because of the
two facts â first, that Judge Parker was
named on the first ballot, and, second,
because with one exception no personal
abuse or vituperation was indulged in.
Each State was allowed to put in
nomination its favorite son and vote
for him, as we had planned. Judge
Parker will, I believe, make an ideal
candidate and will fit the platform,
which also is ideal."

Franklin K. Lane, Frank H. Gould,
James G. Maguire, Charles J. Heggerty,
James H. O'Brien and Washington
Dodge are quite well satisfied with the
nomination. Thomas W. HIckey and
Thomas J. Walsh entertain the great
est admiration for Judge Parker. Max
Popper was one of the Parker "orig
inals." Before 'his departure from the
wigwam of the Iroquols to visit foreign
lands he predicted Parker's nomination.
In the Republican camp the nomina
tion affords pleasure. At the Union
League Club yesterday it was predicted
by former Congressman James A.
Louttit, S. K. Thornton and Charles
Bassett that Roosevelt's majority in
California would approximate 50,000. It
was common remark in Republican
discussion that the trusts and railway
corporations would stand in for Parker
and the people rally around Roosevelt.
The Democratic merchants and busi
ness men of this city regard the nom
ination of Judge Parker with consider
able favor. In the wholesale and Job
bing districts thÂ» comment was decid
edly favorable. It was said that the
selection of a conservative man to lead
the forces of the party would suppress
the ranting agitators of the organiza
tion and assist in quelling the spirit of
anarchy in the land.
Gavin McNab, the leadeV of the Dem
ocratic party in California, is highly
gratified over Judge Parker's nomina
tion. Responding to a request of The
Call for his views concerning the nomi
nee McNab said:
"Judge Alton B. Parker, the Demo
cratic nominee for President of the
United States, as the head of one of
the highest courts on earth has pro
foundly Influenced the Jurisprudence of
America by his w'isdom. His views, as
expressed In his written opinions, are
broad and forceful. His character, pub
lic and private, is the highest. He has
a clear head and clean hands. He is an
ideal American. There Is no reason
why every Democrat should not give
him his enthusiastic support. He should
receive, and no doubt will receive, every
Democratic vote. He Is the splendid
Head of a united Democratic party."
What McNab says will be accepted
as the gospel of the Democratic or
ganization in California. If he so di
rects, the sentiments expressed in the
foregoing: estimate of Judge Parker will
be proclaimed by the Twenty-eighth
Assembly District Democratic Club and
by regular organizations of the party
in other Assembly districts of San
Francisco.

and I hope that the remainder of the
work of the convention will add to the
encouraging prospects of Democratic
success. This is all I can possibly say
at this time. I don't know when I shall
have an opportunity to read the plat
form adopted or to learn of the entire
proceedings cf the convention. In any
event it is absolutely certain that no
further expression from me may be ex
pected at the present time. I hope to
be relieved of further importunities on
this subject."

IN CRITICAL CONDITION. â Mrs. AnnlÂ«
Craven, who was taken to the City and
County Hospital on July 7, suffering from a
criminal operation. Is reported In a critical
condition. ThÂ» police are Investigating 1 th?
case.
A burglar and his son were killed
by bulldogs while attempting to break
into the house of a Hungarian farmer.
It being possible to telegraph and
telephone simultaneously over the same
wire makes the combining of telephone
and telegraph companies probable.
While passing sentence upon two '
burglars yesterday Judge Lawlor said
among other things:
If the Chief of Police, when dealing
with offenders in the winter months,
when these characters come from all
parts of the country to this favored
community, would provide his officers
with shotguns out upon the street to
shoot down such .offenders there
would be less infliction of this class
of crime upon this city.
The two burglars were Joseph M.
Lang, a boy 19 years of age, and Jo
seph M. Wallace. They were each sen
tenced to serve fifteen years in Folsom
penitentiary. They pleaded guilty to a
charge of burglary, and a charge of
robbery against them was placed on
the reserve calendar.
On the morning of February 23 they
opened the window of the room occu
pied by J. R. McMahan at 341 Jessie
street and entered. McMahan was
awakened bv the noise, and on
asking what they wanted was told to
hand over his coin. Lang held a re
volver at his head while Wallace
searched his clothes. McMahan slipped
out of the room, remarking that he
would get some more from the "old
woman." He went to the room of Eu
gene Wright and got Wright's shotgun,
but there were no cartridges. He ran
to the, corner grocery and got some
cartridges. f
Meantime Lang and Wallace had en
tered Wright's room and held him and
his wife up, taking a gold watch and $8
In coin from them. McMahan returned
about that time, and when Wallace
saw him he pulled a revolver out of his
pocket, but McMahan was too quick
for him and fired, wounding him se
verely in the arm. ' Lang had " served
two terms for petty larceny, and Wal
lace admitted having served a term for
burglary committed In RiverBlrla.
The Judge In speaking of the matter
later said: "I am not casting any re
flection upon the Police Department.
The number of police is inadequate for
the proper protection of the city, and
the crooks know it. That is why they
come here. Owing to the hilly nature
of this city it is difficult to catch them
In the act. The only way to deal with
these gentry Is to shoot them when
caught committing a robbery or burg
lary. If a robber held me up I would
shoot him if I had the chance, and
every citizen should do the same. That
Is the only 'way to rid the city of that
class." .
Chief Wittman when Informed of
Judge Lawlor's remarks said he would
be glad if the Legislature passed an
act giving him that power. At present,
he said, his bracers could only arrest
offenders #nd allow the courts to deal
with them.

Miss Trainer said she left Gilroy Friday
night at 8:15 o'clock. Yesterday morn
ing she was talking over the telephone
with her mother, who told her that the
United Undertakers had wired her that
they had Clara's body and wanted in
structions. Miss Trainer had Instruc
tions from her mother to take full
charge, and upon investigation found
that the body of her sister was still at
the Morgue and that her mother had
not given any orders to the United Un
dertakers. Notwithstanding Mrs. Train
er's refusal to do so, the forged order
was presented at the Coroner's office.
Coroner Leland says he will Investi
gate the matter further, and Miss
Trainer may press the charge of for
gery.
Coroner Leland proposes to put a stop
to the struggle for bodies of victims of
accidental deaths, murders or suicides
which are taken to the Morgue. A de
liberate case "of signing a relative's
name to an order by the United Under
takers was called to his attention yes
terday morning by Deputy Coroner
Brown. As a result P. J. Barry and P.
Hansen were on the carpet for fifteen
minutes and received a severe lecture
for their action. The case Is not settled
yet and a charge of forgery may be
preferred against them.
Clara Trainer, a young woman from
Gilroy, committed suicide at 730 Com
mercial street on July 7 by taking car
bolic add. The body was taken to the
Morgue and an autopsy performed.
Yesterday morning P. J. Barry of the
United Undertakers presented an order
at the Coroner's office for the body of
"Clara Traynor." It was signed "Mamie
Traynor, sister of deceased." Barry
was not ready then to take the corpse
away, but a few moments after he left
Halsted & Co. called up the Morgue by
telephone and asked whether they could
have the body to ship to Gilroy on the
evening train. Deputy Brown asked by
what right Halsted asked for the body,
and was Informed that Miss Trainer,
sister of the dead woman, was in their
office at that moment and wanted them
to take charge. Miss Trainer told
Brown over the telephone that she had
not signed any order for the body to be
given to the United Undertakers, and
later she called at the Morgue and
pronounced the signature a forgery.
Later Barry and Hansen were sum
moned to the Coroner's office and con
fronted by the woman. She said they
had asked her to sign the order, but
that she refused. Her name Is spelled
"Trainer," while the record on the book
at the Morgue had the name of her sis
ter "Traynor," and it was signed "In
that way " on the order presented by
Barry. The latter said he had signed
the order on account of a telegram
from the girl's mother, who instructed
his firm to hold the body until relatives
called. '

Captain of Detectives Martin says
that he has not been Instructed to look
for Ackerman or his companions.
When the bibulous captain tires of
treading the primrose path he will
probably return to his ship and square
matters with his employers. He has
a wife, who lives at 6 South Park.
The stories printed of Ackerman being
led astray, by his passengers are en
tirely false.
On his last trip on the Prentiss Cap
tain Ackerman was reprimanded for
bringing three Los Angeles friends â
two of them being of the grentler sex,
to this city. Ackerman was indignant
and croceded to drown his troubles
in a sea of champagne. He is re
ported to be assisted in thi3 task by
the ladies mentioned.
Captain Charles Ackerman, who dis
appeared last "Wednesday with a check
for $600 belonging to the California
and Oregon Steamship Company, .has
not been sandbagged nor has he left

his arrest.

LONDON. July 9 .â Vhen Mascagnl
was in London an organ grinder one
day played under his window the fam
ous Intermezzo from "Cavalleria Rustl
cana." As the man played, he turned
the organ faster and faster until the
air was more like a waltz than an in
termezzo. At last Mascagni could bear
it no longer, antl rushing out of the
house he gave the organ grinder a
shilling and said:
"I have heard that air at the opera,
and I think that you are playing It
too fast. Let me show you how it
ought to be played."
The composer then played the inter
mezzo through in the proper time and
went back to the house.

Another Frenchman who has given
the voluminous tables a great deal of
study says that if there had been no
war in the last century the earth could
not supply food enough for the popu
lation.
In a preface to his volume he sug
gests that the only really effective
method to completely populate the
world Is for all nations to unite to sup
press war fcr at least a century.
When asked if he had considered the
fact that in many places the world is
already over populated he had no ready
reply. ?
PARIS, July 7.â A French statistician
has just made a calculation showing
that in the last century 14,000,000 men
were killed in war. He has read thou
sands of pages In history and spent
more than three years in preparing his

"From a child I was never strong and
had a capricious appetite, and I was
allowed to eat whatever I fancied â
rich cake, highly seasoned food, hot
biscuit, etcâ so it was not surprising
that iny digestion was soon out of or-
der, and at the age of twenty-three I
was on the verge of nervous prostra-
tion. I had no appetite and as I had
bÂ«Â»en losing strength (because I didn't
get nourishment in my dally food to re-
pair the wear and tear on body and
brain) I had no reserve force to fall

cine helped me.

GUAR^T E EED f sr REDINGTON & CO., Wholesale Agents."I used to think," sarcastically and
paraphrastlcally said the Old Codger,

His Improvement.
What comes from the heart goes to
the heart. . '" .
A email boy aged 5 years had a step
mother who was young and nervous.
She had never, had experience with
children, and the small boy's slightest
ailment tortured her Into a panic.
Croup threatened one day, and the
doctor was sent, for in wild haste. As
the doctor entered the room the child
raised his head from his pillow and
croaked hoarsely in apology for the
hasty summons:
; "You must excuse her, doctor; this is
the first time she has ever been a moth
er."âLipplncott's Magazine.
Excused His Inexperience.
"Any one visiting the crypt under
the rotunda will notice a star In the
pavement in the exact center, so that
a plumb suspended from the dome
center would hang over it. From this
point at right angles start the lines
which form the quadrants of the city
plan â N. E., S. E. t N. W.,' S. W. In
182T Congress authorized observations
to be made of., this same north and
south line to ascertain the longitude
of the Capitol in the city of Wash
ington from some known meridian in
Europe and also to establish a prime
meridian for the United States. These
determinations gave also .'atitude 75
degrees 55 minutes and 30 seconds,
longitude 54 west of Greenwich.
"Whatever action may be taken with
respect to buildings on the mall, the
equilibrium of that symmetrical area
in the heart of the city and the base
of its plan should not be disturbed
by any change in its axis, which now
traverses its exast center east and west
between B street North and B street
South. To deflect it either to the
south or north would not only mar its
value at a datum line, but have a de
cidedly unbalanced appearance on the
maps.
Â¦ The grand avenue or mall, as ap
proved by "Washington, has so long
been the chief feature of the city's
park system that to further mar it
with buildings, especially in utter dis
regard of the plans of Washington and
; L'Enfant, seems to be like the deface
i ment of a landmark surrounded by
many associations. The removal of
the rookeries on the south side of the
| avenue would have the double effect
of embellishment and utility and bring
out the historic mall In its full beauty.

With the prospects of a general elec
tion at hand, it is as well to know whom
you may nominate to represent you in
the House of Commons, and perhaps
the best manner in which to do this is
to mention those persons who are dis
qualified from holding office as mem
bers of Parliament.
For instance, no English or Scotch
peer may be elected a member of the
House of Commons, but an Irish peer
may sit, providing he is not one of the
twenty-eight Irish peers chosen to sit
in the House of Lords. A famous peer
who played a prominent part in politics
in the House of Commons in the middle
of last century was Lord Palmerston,
who was an Irish peer.
Clergymen of the English church and
ministers of the Scotch church are not
permitted to become possessors of the
proud title of "M. P.," nor Roman
Catholic priests. But up to the begin
ning of the last century the question of
the admission of the clergy to the
House of was Involved in
considerable doubt.
There was a heated discussion in the
House about 4he time when Rev. J.
Home Tooke was elected for the bor
ough of Old Sarum. Lord John Russell
was returned to Parliament before he
was 21. ;
Strange to 6ay though. Lord John
rang the death knell of the hopes of
ambitious young men who aspired to
enter Parliament before they had at
tained their majority, for he was in
strumental in passing the great reform
bill, which touched on that point, and
since that time the law has been strict
ly observed.
"Aliens" may not sit in the House of
Commons unless they have become
British subjects according to the forms
prescribed by law, nor can any one who
has been convicted of treason or felony,
unless he has received a pardon or
served his term of punishment. A per
son convicted of any minor offense is
not actually disqualified from sitting,
but he can be expelled by vote of the
House.
A bankrupt may be elected, but
while he is undischarged he is not al
lowed to attend to his Parliamentary
duties, and if he remains undischarged
for a longer period than six months the
seat Is declared vacant. A man who
has been found guilty of corrupt prac
tices â such as bribery at a party elec
tion â may never again sit for the place
at which the offense was committed,
nor until seven years after for any
other place.
The holding of certain offices disqual
ifies some persons. Judges cannot act
as members of Parliament, since, by
virtue of their office, they can be sum
moned to attend and give advice in the
House of Lords; neither can a paid
Charity Commissioner, nor a member
of the Council of India, while no re
turning officer can sit for the place for
which he exercises his duties. Like
wise, a number of pensioners of the
crown and persons who hold or under
take any contracts or commissions for
th*e public service may not be elected.
If any of the latter should be returned
the election would at once be declared
void and they would be liable to a fine
of Â£500 for every day on which they
sat in the house. â London Answers.
It's as difficult for some men to sea

Russian Editor Declares His Country
Is Not Seeking Territory.
FIGHTING FOR HER FUTURE.
ST. PETERSBURG, Julv 9.â M.
Souvrin, manager of the Novoe Vrem*
ya, In a leading article in that paper
â¢which is attracting much attention,
declares that it is not Manchuria nor
Korea for which Russia is fighting, but
it is her future position in the Far
East, where covetous hands are
stretched out, not only by Japan, but
by the United States and Great Brit
ain, which is the cause of the Ameri
can and English sympathy for Japan.
Russia, he continues, has been spoiled
by easy, bloodless victories in the Far
East, consequently was not prepared
for the struggle which was only avoid
able by following Tolstoi's teachings
and letting the Japanese take what
they wanted, with the result that Rus
sia would again ""be placed under he
Mongol, destroying the national spirit
and the unity of the empire. The con
test, therefore, was accepted under un
favorable conditions. The Russians as
plainsmen, are out of their element in
the mountains. The Japanese were able
at the outset to put in the field twice
as many men as was Russia, and they
have displayed marvelous skill, but
these advantages are being overcome.
Still the event of the Russian victory
on land will be barren so long as the
Japanese hold the sea. This Is why
the Baltic squadron acquires such enor
mous importance in the destinies of
Russia and why the ardent wish of a
majority of the people is to see the last
division start out to reinforce the Pa
cific fleet.
The Novoe Vremya article tends to
strengthen the belief that the division
of the Baltic squadron which is to
sail from' Cronstadt July 28, under
sealed orders, is to proceed at once
to the Pacific.
STOESSEL SEXDS REPORT.
Confirms Story of Japanese Opera
tions Against Port Arthur.
ST. PETERSBURG, July 9, 2:10
p. m. â Official reports from General
Stoessel, commander of the Russian
military forces at Port Arthur, dated
July 7, confirm the reports of the at
tempt of the four Japanese torpedo
boat destroyers to enter the harbor of
Port Arthur June 27. but do not con
firm the Chefu report of heavy Jap
anese operations of July 4 and 5
against Port Arthur and do not men
tion the alleged sinking of a Russian
cuardship June 27, as reported from
Tokio.
The torpedo-boat destroyer Lieu-
The capture of Kaichou (Kaiping)
throws the Japanese line clear across
the Liaotung Peninsula and from the
Yalu River to the Liaotung Gulf. Kai
chou is about twenty-five miles south
of Kinkow, the port of Newchwang,
â¢which Is on the railway, and about
twelve miles to the southeast of New
chwang.
"It la somewhat singular that the
Congressional committee inquiries,
hearings and deliberations concerning
the fundamental engineering Â¦ features
of the city and particularly the mall,
do not take into account the office
which President Washington, himself
an expert engineer, established for the
preparation of a plan and its develop
ment and where the original surveys
and notes made under his own eye
and with his approval are preserved,"
said an expert engineer familiar with
the topographical history of the Dis
trict.
"During the summer of 1791, while
spending a brief vacation from the
cares of office at Philadelphia, on his
estate at Mount Vernon, the President
met his engineer at Georgetown and
passed an entire day galloping over
the corn fields which then covered' the
site of the future capital and examined
the locations which had been outlined
as what was then known as the public
reservations, seventeen in number, in
certain of which were to be placed the
public buildings.
"Their first objective was the eleva
tion known as Jenkins ' (now Capitol)
Hill. At this point- the engineer called
his attention to the western border of |
the plateau as the most suitable loca- j
tion for the Federal house (Capitol). ]
Then after directing attention to the !
broad stretch of valley encircled on the
nortb by a range of hills terminating
in Georgetown Heights and washed on :
the south by the Potomac, the engi
neer indicated in the distance the site ',
of the President's house and 'to the
south a knoll where he had mapped
the site of the equestrian monument
voted in his chiefs honor by the Con- |
tinental Congress in 1783. Between the
Federal house and this knoll, toward
the west, and from the same point to
the east, a distance of one mile, where
it was proposed to erect an historic
column, It was the purpose of the en- j
gineer to establish the axis of his plan. Â¦
From this base line all surveys were to ;
be measured. The President and his
engineer having determined on this in
itial step, galloped along the Tiber to ',
the knoll referred to, from which point ;
they looked back upon the hill. The
President, at once grasping the situa
tion, not only gave his approval to this
line, but also the point selected for the
statue in his honor. From here they
continued their ride to the site of the
President's house, to the location of
which the President also gave his con
sent 1 i
"The feasibility of the actual work
ing of the plan as proposed by his
engineer was apparent to the expert
Judgment of "Washington as a surveyor,
and not only received his sanction, but
orders to proceed forthwith. The first
step was the establishment of the ini
tial point on the spot which the Presl- ;
dent had Indicated on Jenkins Hill.
For this purpose Major L'Enfant, as
sisted by Mr. Ellicott, also an expert,
drew a true meridional\ line by 'ce
lestial* observation, passing through
the area intended for the Federalhouse.
This line extended north along the cen
ter of a proposed street, now North
Capitol, and south In the same way.
This was, in fact, the prime meridian of
the United States. This line was crossed
by another due $ast and west which
passed through ' the ' same area. This
axis to the west lay in the center of
the mall to a monument on the ground
placed there on December â¢ 2, 1804. by
order of President Jefferson, still shown
by the inscription as a true parallel
on the globe, at the point of intersec
tion of a north and south line, -the
north limb of which passed through
the center of the President's house.
The axial line extending east followed
what Is now the exact center of East
Capitol street. The one mile terminates
in. the center of now Lincoln Square.
."To show the significance of this
point it was proposed that the his
toric column should be an . 'itinerary'
column as well, from which all dis
tances through the 'continent' were to
calculated. All the â¢ east and west
streets are parallel to this line. These
lines were actually measured and made
the bases upon' which: the whole plan
was , executed- All lines as the sur
veys ; progressed â¢ were run by a tran
sit instrument and ; the acute angles
Â¦were determined by actual measure
ment; leaving nothing to the uncer
tainty of the compass. â¢ Around the
initial point referred to in the course

MUST STAY OUT
OF PARLIAMENT
PLAN OF CITY
GENERAL'S OWN
News of the evacuation of New
chwang by the Russians would seem
to be the logical sequence of the an
nouncement of the occupation of Kai
chou by the Japanese.
The occupation of Kalche-u, while it
is not believed that it will exercise
material influence on Kuropatkin's
strategy, is of importance to the Jap
anese, as it brings them within reach
of Newchwang, facilitating General
Oku's juncture with General Kuroki,
who njay already be in touch. How
far the Russian commander in chief
attempted to contest the possession of
Kaichou with the Japanese, the War
Office says will be revealed when the
official report arrives. The Japanese
reports of the severity of the fighting
might Indicate Kuropatkin's desire to
hold Kaichou as long as pos
sible for the purpose of pre
venting a juncture 'of the Jap
anese armies, but the threatening po
sition of the Japanese columns east
ward may have rendered Kuropatkin's
withdrawal farther north imperative.
It would not be surprising after the
juncture of the Japanese armies If
Kuropatkin decided to retire even
from Tatchekiao and Halcheng and
concentrate his forces about his main
position at Liaoyang. This would ren
der easy the Japanese plan to get pos
session of these places, flank the Rus
sians out of Newchwang, fortify a line
from Newchwang across the head of
the peninsula to Takushan and Feng
wangcheng, secure control of the rail
road, establish a new base at New
chwang and prepare <to advance or
retreat or to resist Kuropatkin's ad
vance, as the case might be, at the
close of the rainy season.
ST. PETERSBURG. July 9, 2:10
p. m.â The capture of Kalchou by the
Japanese, announced from Tokio to
day, Is not officially confirmed at the
"War Office, but there is no dis
position to question the probable cor
rectness of the report, aa the latest ad
vices received here make it plain that
the Japanese were advancing in force
along the railroad against the Russian
position. .
tenant Burukoff returned safely to
Port Arthur July 2 from Newchwang.
General Stoessel says that up to the
time his reports were forwarded not
a single fortress battery had fired a
shot at the besiegers on the land side
and that the railroad was then run
ning twelve miles beyond the perl
meter of the fortress.
COMPLICATIONS NOT EXPECTED.
Object of British Warships In Asiatic
Waters Known to Russia.
LONDON, July 9. â It Is said in offi
cial circles that there is no likelihood
of a serious question arising from the
failure cf the British gunboat Espiegle
to reach Newchwang. So long as for
eign life and property . are protected
the British Government'is not disposed
to station a gunboat at Newchwang.
It is stated x moreover, that Russia is
fully advised as to the purpose of
Foreign Minister Lansdowne in re
spect to the protection of British in
terests and subjects.
The presence of a British! squadron
In waters near the Gulf of Pechill has
been the subject of considerable talk
in diplomatic circles, and the order
for the squardon to withdraw south Is
credited to the desire of the British
Government to show Russia that it
has no intention of giving even moral
support to the Japanese fleet by the
presence of a large British force in
the vicinity of the scene of the latter*s
operations.
SKIRMISHES ARE FREQUENT.
Chief of Russian Staff Reports Few
Minor Affairs Near Port Arthur.
ST. PETERSBURG, July 9. â The
War Minister to-day received a dis
patch from General Kuropatkin's chief
of staff reporting a couple of unim
portant affairs between frontier
guards and small ; parties of Chinese
bandits near Port Arthur and adding
that the troops forming the garrison
are in excellent spirits. Skirmishes
occur daily. The Russians captured
fifty Japanese scouts on July 1 and
the chief of police recently captured
240 head of cattle. There is an abun
dance of ammunition at Port Arthur,
the dispatch adds.
Port Arthur Unchanged.
CHEFU, July 9, 8 p. m. â Part of
the staff of the bank of the Russo-
Chinese Bank which was located at
Port Arthur arrived here to-day and
report the condition of the town to be
unchanged. There was heavy fighting:
seven miles from Port Arthur all last
week, and junks which came in here
to-day report having heard firing off
the harbor this morning.
Forces of the Mikado Are Now Within Reach of New
chwang and It Is Thought Probable That Gen
erals Oku and Kuroki Have Formed a Juncture

Twenty Mexicans were arrested for

The only really pood outlookâ that
upon the grounds of the Wharacliffe
House opposite â has perhaps sufficed
for much. As Wharnclilfe House
stands well back from the road, the
gardens are only separated from tha
Marlboroughs' palace by the width of
Curzon street itself, so it might almost
be their own. Last year, too, on the
death of the owner, the house was
bought by no less a personage than
tie Earl of Crewe, so that the Duke
Â«.r.d Duchess of Marlborough had for
opposite neighbors the Earl and Coun
tess of Crewe, the latter being the
daughter of the Earl of Rosebery. But
row yet another disappointment for
the Mariboroughs. Within a year of
their purchase Lord Crewe has put a
notification in the proper quarter that
he win be glad to dispose of Wham
cliffe House. Folks are asking "Why?"
Is it that tho x deep foundations which
have brought about such disaster to
the Marlboroughs' house have upset
any others in the neighborhood?
It is by no means a no\*el thing to
come upon the beds of old rivers in
London, for nowhere did so- many
streams, !arpe and small, meet the
main riv^r on its course to the sea as
round and about where London now is.
Subterranean rivers r.cw flowing under
the metropolis are utilized as sewers,
and the Kdgewarc. which was a ttream
OI considerable dimensions, watered
pans of Mayfair on Its way to Join
Father Thames.
Nor was this startling discovery
n-.ade in time to save the palace or
when plans could have been altered.
The bitterest pill of all comes in the
fact that this monstrous trouble could
have all been avoided. When a chapel
rtoc-i on the very spot where the Marl
borough palact is now erected no one
<evÂ«?r dreamt that a subterranean river
had once run its course beneath its
crypt and at its deepest foundations
there Â¦was no sign c-f such a resistless
element. Had the same depth of foun
dciion satisfied the Harlbcroughs ail
would have been welL But it did not.
To economize space, to give greater
area of state rooms, receptions, bed
rooms, etc.. not one Inch of the pal
ace that appeared above the surface
of the ground was to be given up for
vht accommodation of servants. Re
tainers there would be In plenty, but
these were to be accommodated else
where. As :n many another London
house the basement of this ducal pal
ace in Curzoa street is given over to*
kitchens, etc. And then below* these.
still farther removed from the light
*)f day, comes another floor, which is
divided np to form the bedrooms and
sitting-roccis of the domestics. Where
ordinary pecpl e have their cellars. In
their London horne, the Marlboroughs
lodge their servants. And having dug
60 deeply into the earth, they have
touched not the bedrock, but an ever
moving stratum washed by the ebb and
Bow of the river's tide.
The free use of the pump keeps the
water frcta rising, but the necessity
for the everlasting presence of this use
ful instrument worries the American
Duchees and her Duke bitterly, for it
r-.akes the house damp, threatens to
weaken the foundations and is likely
to introduce germs Into the place.
Why they should have had the mis
fortune to have pitched their tent upon
this very Epot Is beyond their compre
heneic-a, for the site is not the most
desirable in Mayfair.
tbe Marl borough* ncr.e can really ini
ad&e. for weeks and months were spent
scosrins the fashionable quarters in
London for a suitable site whereon
ttey could build their ducal palace.
AnU !t was no easy victory when at
last they obtained permission, backed
by many thousands of pounds, to pull
down the famous and fashionable
church in Curzon street so that they
might erect under their own super
vision a modern mansion of stupendous
luxury. There were drawbacks to the
kite from many points of view; but
what could they do? It was the best
available, and no one ever thought of
looking up the old physical geographies
cf the place.
m bitter is the disappointment of
LONDON, July 9.â Despair has set
tfed u?cn the Duke and Duchess of
Maryborough. Their beautiful London
bora*, the ducal palace upon which
:r.ty have spent J5.000.000 and no end of
pall* Is the source of their bitter dls
appointsieiit. It ig finished, the ma-
jlle occupying: the whole of one
ksaII block, is absolutely completed
tr.i to the smallest detail Its furniah
:r.gs ere perfection. V. T ithin a large re
tlnna ct the most capable servants add
lie last word of comfort to the wealth
cr luxury to be found there; but to the
Marltcroughs all this is as nothing.
Pleasure in their London home has de
parted, for they have just discovered
that they built not upon a rock, but
ir^vciiâ upon the bed of a river.
And into their home now that all is
CsishwS. day by day and hour by hour,
creeps water, so persistently, Â£0 un
ett.s:zigly that a pump must always be

CALIFORNIANS, living in a climate where ex
tremes of heat and cold with an occasional cy
clone for variety are unknown quantities, rarely
comprehend the rigors of the Eastern winter or the
sufferings of those in the cities unable to escape the ter

present contain accounts of people dying from the un
bearable heatâ one victim being the cliild of a well
known pugilist dying in the arms pf its nurse in a street
carâwhile the telegraph has just given a description of
a cyclone blowing an entire, passenger train except the
locomotive from a bridge near Oakford, 111., at the cost
of two lives and a dozen injured.

When one reads the speech of John Sharp Williams,
delivered as the keynote of Democratic . policy in the
national convention at St.* Louis, and reflects upon the
masterpiece spoken by Elihu Root as the exponent of

that Mr. Williams, having neither argument nor sug

Having no case he must abuse the opposing counsel.
It has been suggested to me that
many readers of "Notes and Queries"
might be glad of a few hints as to
the pronunciation of those Japanese
places and Dersonal names now so
prominently figuring in our magazines
and papers. There is little difficulty
in pronouncing Japanese correctly,
since the vowels are all sounded as In
Italian and^the consonants as In Eng
lish. It is' worthy of remark, how
ever, that, although theoretically sh
should be sounded as in English,
some of the best Japanese speakers
reduce it to a simple s. Hence we get
Sikoku for the island of Shlkoku, and
Tsussima for the island of Tsushima.
The reduction of ts to s is, on the
other hand, merely a blunder of our
journalists, some of whom the other
day degraded Tsushima into Susima,
just as some maps degrade the Tsu
gara Strait Into Sugaru. The stress
generally falls upon the penultimate:
Himejl, Osaka, Hakodate, Nagasaki,
Yokohama, Shimonosekl, Utsunomiya.
There are exceptions, such as O'gawn,
Kanagawa, O'shlma, Horoshima, Mfttr
eushlma, Katsura, Komura, Satsuma.

'Answers to Qu*riej<
The first Englishman who is known
for certain to have gone out to India
was, according to a recent correspond
ent in an Indian paper, a certain Thom
as Stephens, a member of a well-to-do
Wiltshire family and an Oxonian, who
landed somewhere near Goa about the
year 1579 and spent forty years In
Jesuit missionary work in Goa and the
neighborhood. Stephens not only suc
ceeded in mastering Marathi and Kon
kan, which were the languages spoken
by the majority of the people on the
west coast, but left behind him among
other works in Marathi of literary merit
the "Purana," an epic, and it Is In his
capacity as the author of this that Ste
phens' name is best known among the
west coa3t inhabitants.
The poem contains over 11,000 strophes
of four lines each. It narrates in a lofty
style the events that led up to the es
tablishment of the Christian religion,
and from the creation to the ascension
of our Lord, who figures as the hero
of the epic. A new edition of the
"Purana" Is to be published In Manga
lore, no printed copy of the work being
now available.â The Athenaeum.

Carlyle's opinion of Herbert Spencer
as "the most unending ass In Chris
tendom" must, of course, be read la
conjunction with Carlyle's derision for
mankind In general. "Mostly fools,'*
he cheerfully thought of us all. Dar
win, we know, he would not have at
any price â not a word of him. Car
dinal Newman, he estimated, had
"the brain of a medium-sized rabbit."
Ruskin was a bottle of soda water. "A 1
bad young man" was his sum-up of
another eminett writer, whom wa
need not name, for he Is still living.
But these hostile phrases were sub
ject to considerable modification If tha
man against whom they were aimed!
came near enough to Carlyla to do
him a personal favor, even to pas;
him a personal compliment. DLstmII,
whom he bad described as a mounts

ach, offered Carlyla a baronstC7 an4

refusal of the title, many tributes to

The following Is the programme of
band music in Golden Gate Park to
day. Paul Stelndorff, conductor:
Music in the Park.
Our foreign immigration instead of being, digested
and assimilated by us is digesting and assimilating us,
and the South will soon turn from the negro question to
consider one that may be of far more importance to her.
We have the negro with us. He is a workman and he
is a soldier. He has absorbed American traits and feels
that this is his country. It may later appear that he is
preferable as an economic and national factor to much of
the foreign immigration that other countries are send
ing to us for their erood and our injury. ."
THE negro problem in this country has been many
sided and each side has reflected alarm to the
whites of the South. The extraordinary fecundity
of the race seemed to indicate its final complete pos
session of several Southern States. The prospect of the
whites being overpowered by sheer numbers was not
pleasant. In Mississippi, Alabama and South Carolina
it seemed sure that the increase of the blacks would in
a few decades leave the whites no choice but to move on
and leave the land to the descendants of their slaves.
A careful sifting of the facts of the census of 1900
materially soothes the alarm. It is proved that not only
is" the negro birth rate decreasing, but the death rate in
creases. The white population of the South shows ex
actly the opposite, an increase of birth rate and. decrease
of death rate, and the process is aided by increasing
white immigration and increasing black migration. The
negroes show an increasing tendency to move into the
Northern States, where they arc distributed in smaller
numbers, are not crowded and thrown back on them
selves so much, and as a result are improved in every
way except the birth rate, which is far lower among the
Northern than the Southern blacks. It would appear
that nature is at work on the problem by securing a bal
ance and that the grim forebodings that the South will
become another Hayti or San Domingo, are not justified.
But there is before the South, a change of feature that
promises to be of the greatest interest to the whole
country. Slavery kept domestic and foreign immigra
tion out of the South. There were only two classes
there, slave labor and its white owners. As all countries
are founded on their labor system the South did not rest
on free labor, and as men go where they can use their
labor freely almost none went South and the great tide
of foreign. immigration rose upon the North.
This had some good effects and some bad. It brought
to us some virile strains of blood from Europe, but it
materially lowered or crowded out the original Ameri
can type in New England and the West. The Northern
States suffered as much as they gained by it in t.h'fe,
classifying of their people by nationality and occupation,
and the planting here of the racial feuds and prejudices
imported from Europe. Saddest of all was the impor
tation of European ideas about a distinct laboring class,
always set apart and exclusive, which threatens to do
finally as much harm to us as chattel slavery did and to
require the same surgery of war to eradicate it.
The South, not getting foreign immigration, has until
now remained the most distinctly American part of the
country. It had less admixture and whatever the occa
sional faults of its people they have kept closely to
American traditions. Now it is probable that all this
will be changed. Unless our immigration laws are
amended and the river of foreign immigration is turned
it will inundate the South, and as the negro retires.it
will take his place, and very soon intermarriage will give
the South the polyglot population that in many impor
tant respects will be less desirable than the excellent
character type which it displaces.
THE NEGROES DECREASE.
Russian critics have much to say in derision of what
they are pleased to call the indecision of Generals Kuroki
and Oku in the Manchurian campaign that the rainy
season has suspended. It might be well for these chuck
ling observers to reflect that the Manchurian campaign
is not yet over and that both of the Japanese captains
have proved their ability to keep their own counsel until
actions justify their words.
Most of these exceptions bar* In thefÂ»
penultimate the rowels 1 or u, which
are always short In Japanese, aad la
many words and namts are omitted
altogether colloquially. The samurai,
or Japanese army officer. Is popularly
pronounced sam'rai.
There are two Japanese loan word*
In English which have been naturalized
in their shorter form, minus the silent
u, viz., the familiar motxsme (Jan.*
musuxne), and the botanical term noÂ«
(Jap., xnagusa). In Japanese oxw
thography the full forms alone are em
ployed. From this It happens that sev
eral names written with four syllables
â e. g., Shimotauke, Tokosukaâ are
spoken with three, Shlmots'ke. To
kos'ka. A good example Is the nans of
the reigning Emperor, Mutsuhlto. la
Its termination hlto the h is excessively,
palatalized, so that, the 1 disappearing:.
It sounds like shto, and the name Is
heard as a trisyllable. Mutsush'to. Ea
revanche, the English reader is often
In danger In taking for three syllables]
a name which really has four, e. r..
Inouye, Nilgata, Terauchl. The secret
Is that each vowel must be separately
enunciated, I-no-u-ye, Nl-1-ga-ta, Te-Â»

Some of the best "prize contests" of
recent years have been started by the

and Pearson's Weekly, and the "five

closed not long ago was particularly
alluring. Week by week the paper

HEADQUARTERS OF THE CALL,
5 HENRIETTA STREET. COVENT
GARDEN. LONDON. June 24.â I won
der if Dr. A. Conan Doyle's numerous
readers In the United States have
heard that he gave a publlo exhibition
of dancing the other day? The dance
â¢â¢done" by Dr. Doyle was a reel, aad
the spectacle of Its execution delighted
the hearts of several thousand people
who probably never had hoped to see
so distinguished an author tripping the
light fantastic Be it explained, how
ever, that Dr. Doyle danced, not as a
distinguished author, but as a political
candidate. The attempt that is being
made by the creator of Sherlock
Holmes to get into Parliament for Ha
wick Burghes took him up to the Bor
der country the other day. Finding In
full blast the open-air festivities which
take place there every year, the liter
ary candidate felt it politic to partici
pate in themâ hence the reeL Whether
Dr. Doyle kissed any babies has not
been reported, but he did promise to
captain one of the teams at a forth
coming cricket match at Hawick. The
national game, however, is much more
in the burly author's line than danc
ing. I am told' that Dr. Doyle's recent
visits to the Border country have pro
vided him with the material for a
novel which he means to begin work
on soon after his political canvass is
endedâ ao matter how It results. In
this, his third attempt to get into Par
liament, Dr. Doyle is trying to oust
Thomas Shaw, M. P., who now sits for
Hawick Burghes.
Doubtless mention has been made in
the cable dispatches of the hard things
that Miss Marie Corelliâ who has a
new novel coining out soon â has been
saying about the English clergy, which
she stigmatizes as "pagan." This is a
strong term, though one that Miss Co
relli probably would not have hesitated
to use in any event. She borrowed it,
however, from Archdeacon Sinclair,
who recently declared that London was
becoming a pagan city, because people
did not go to church. Writing with all
her customary restraint. Miss Corelli
says the trouble Is with the preachers.
"When great dignitaries of the
church," Bhe Bays in a pleasant para
graph which Is characteristic of her
entire screed, "eit wlne-blbbing at
'swagger' dinner parties, relating ques
tionable or 'spicy* anecdotes unfit for
the ears of decent women, they have
not only lost caste themselves, but
have laid all the brethren of thelr< or
der open to doubt."
The Rev. Edwards C. Hawkins Is
best known to fame as the father of
Anthony Hope, but, as most Americans
know, he is also vicar of the historic
old Church of St. Bride's on Fleet
street. This office, which he has held
for twenty-one yeans, the Rev. Mr.
Hawkins is now about to resign. He
Is 77 and a younger brother of the
famous Lord Brampton, who before
his retirement was reckoned one of the
most able Judges on the English bench.
The question of who was Petrarch's
"Laura" has Just been raised on the
Continent apropos of the six hun
dredth anniversary of the poet's birth.
For many years it has been supposed
that 6he was Laura di Noves â member
of an old Provencal family â who mar
ried Hugo de Sade of Avignon. But
upon Investigation It seems there is no
reason whatever for believing this to
be the case except the word of a cer
tain Abbe de Sade, who flourished In
the eighteenth century, and who it is
now suspected only wanted to flatter
his vanity with an interesting geneal
ogy. Among those who have been dis
cussing the subject Is M. Gebhert, the
distinguished French writer on the
Renaissance, who says all his re
searches have confirmed him In the,
opinion that the Immortal mistress of
the poet Is quite unidentifiable, but
was almost certainly of no importance
and of plebeian origin.
Evidently the researches which Eden
Fhilpotts made a year or so ago in
the Dartmoor country, with epeclai
reference to its American associations,
were unusually productive of "ma
terial." His novel, "The American
Prisoner, 0 -which was the first result
of those researches, contained enough
of both plot and local color for two
ordinary romances, but It seems not to
have exhausted the matter in hand.
Mr. Philpotts told an acquaintance the
other day that the new novel upon

Dr. Doyle Dances in Public.
LONDON. June 24. â English folk
were a good deal surprised the
other day when they discovered
that the British Weather Office is
run, not by the Government, but I
by a Joint stock limited liability com
pany aided by a Government subsidy.
That Interesting information was made
public by the report of a Parliamentary
committee, which was appointed to in
quire into the affairs of the company,
and which recommends that the organ
ization be wound up and Its work car
ried on in something like up-to-dato
fashion, as a regular part of the ma
chinery of the state.
The British Weather Office affords a
striking example of the muddling
methods which characterize the man
agement of so many important na
tional Institutions In this country.
Fifty years ago it was created as a
branch of the Board of Trade, with
Admiral Fitzroy at Its head. A few
years later the admiral died and the
Government, anxious to shirk all pos
sible burdens and responsibilities, be
sought the Royal Society to look after
the weather for them, promising to
supply the necessary funds. The Royal
Society undertook the Job and appoint
ed a meteorological council to supervise j
it. In order that the office thus turned j
out of doors by its parent, the Govern- j
ment, might have some definite stand
ing, it was registered as a company
and the council became the directors,
though no dividends were paid, no
trade carried on, and the only source
of revenue was the paltry Government j
&rant of $76,500 a year. John Bull j
takes a long time to wake up, and it j
Is after half a century's experience of j
the utter inadequacy of the system I
pursued that it Is proposed to reorgan- j
ize the office and transfer it to the i
Board of Agriculture. j
As at present constituted the Brit
ish Weather Bureau compares with the
American Institution much as that
antiquated, slow and cumbersome ]
vehicle, a London 'bus, compares with I
a Pullman palace car. It Is housed in
a few little poky offices in Victoria
street, and its scientific equipments
are utterly Insufficient for an under
taking of such vast importance to
commercial and agricultural Indus
tries- Most of the bureau's work is
done by a small staff of underpaid
clerks, totally deficient In meteoro
logical training. On Sundays, up to late
in the evening, the place is closed up
tight as a drum, and during the inter
val the weather may Indulge In what
soever vagaries it pleases, free from
official observation. No efforts what
ever are made to forecast "cold snaps,"
accurate warnings of which would en
able fruit growers and agriculturists
to gave many thousands of dollars.
In sending out storm warnings the
bureau Is much hampered by the In
efficiency of the postoffice, which con
trols the telegraph lines. "Such mes
sages," states the recent committee re
port, "frequently reach their destina
tion fourteen hours after the observa
tions on which the warnings had been
based." Out of 120 warning telegrams
sent out on a certain morning only
nineteen were delivered on the same
evening. As for such storms as are
reckless enough to blow on Sundays,
tidings of them are more belated still.
The postoffice accepts money for such
messages, but the weather office being
a private institution, no exceptional fa
cilities are granted for their transmis
sion and no responsibility Is assumed
for their delivery. If the weather office
were conducted as a department of the
Government messages emanating from
It would be entitled to the exceptional
treatment accorded Government busi
ness and "rushed." But as things are
at present the rules and regulations of
the postoffice admit of no distinction
between a trivial private message and a
telegram conveying Information of an
approaching gale, and which If deliv
ered In time might prevent shipwrecks
and save many human lives. It Is a
lovely example of blind devotion to the
requirements of red tape which is so
eminently characteristic of British of
ficialdom. It was some time ago sug
gested that storms might be forecast
with much greater accuracy If arrange
ments were made for receiving me
teorological reports from Atlantic liners
fitted up with wireless telegraphic ap
paratus. That a system of this sort
would save to the nation annually a
thousandfold what It would cost is ad
mitted. But two obstacles prevent Its
being carried Into effectâ lack of funds
and the absence of any postoffice facili
ties for the reception of wireless mes
sages. And thus the penny wise and
pound foolish policy has again tri
umphed.
The British Board of Agriculture in
its way Is Just as antiquated and In
efficient as the weather office, and there
is little ground for expecting that un
der its control there would be much
improvement in the weather forecast
ing. It is not surprising, therefore, that
two members of the committee dissent
from the recommendation that it should
annex the weather office.
HAYDEN CHURCH.
Special CorrÂ«epo&de&cÂ«.
John Bull's "Old Probs."
The "house" which it is proposed to
found in Paris i3 called a church
house. But there is nothing exclusive
ly churchy about it, though the pro
ject is under the direction of the Brit
ish Embassy Church. British young
men and women of all denomina
tions â or no denomination at all â will
be welcomed to make ,use of it. The
originators of the project want money,
for the acquisition of which they are
holding a bazaar. Just opened by Sir
E. Monson, the British Embassadar,
and Lady Monson. The project was
launched some years ago by Ldrd Duf
ferln during his tenure of the office
of Embassador here. He mentioned
the subject In a speech delivered by
him at tha Guildhall, London. He
Invited subscriptions. He was a per
suasive beggar. Guineas were at
tracted to him like iron filings to a
magnet. So that the result of his Ex
cellency's intervention was a haul of
Â£2000. It was characteristic of Lord
Duff erin that he gave up the luxurious
rooms of the British embassy for the
holding of the first bazaar. The*fcum
mentioned above was made up partly
of the profits of this bazaar, partly of
subscriptions from England. This
year's bazaar is held at 25 Rue Pierre-
Charron. A second sum of Â£2000 is
needed to start the house. The amount
realized yesterday fell short of the de
sired total. To-day the bazaar was
opened by the Countess de Castel
lane, daughter of the late American
millionaire. Jay Gould. The proposed
house is to be a place, as Dr. Noyes
of the British Embassy Church de
scribes it, for "Social gatherings, re
ligious meetings," it will be provided
with books and newspapers. Its "doors
will be wide open, early and late;
should you want an English doctor
you will be able to hear of one there.
Should you require a gentle, skillful
English nurse, you will only need to
apply there. Should you want a gov
erness or a tutor, you will only have
to mention the fact there. British
young men! you will find there a club,
where you can spend your evenings
without spending your money." Dr.
Noyes winds up his description of the
house with a request for contributions.
You will see that the new Institution Is
intended to serve the purposes of a
registry office. It should prove highly
useful to young English women who
come to Paris for employment, and
Â¦whoâ as I pointed out In an article on
the Anglo-American Home, a most ad
mirable institution â are often victim
ized by the ordinary "bureau du place

offices, against which employes and
professional people are agitating in
almost every French town. â London

THE conventions of the two great parties of the
country have been held, their platforms adopted
and their candidates nominated. The issues of the
Presidential campaign are therefore made up as clearly
as it is p.ossible for them to be expressed in words or
embodied in the personalities of leaders; nevertheless a
foreigner studying the situation would find it difficult to
determine what is to be the issue of the campaign.
There is indeed no particular point of national policy
involved in the contest. The real issue is one of charac
ter rather than of any single political feature of the
times. The differences of the characters of the two
parties are noted in the personnel of the two conven
tions, in their methods of procedure, in the platforms
adopted and in the candidates named. It matters not
from what point of view the situation is considered, nor
toward what aspect of it attention is directed, it will ap
pear to every observer that the Republican party pre
sents" a clearly defined and positive policy represented by
men who have a record for statesmanship, while the
Democratic party presents nothing but an opposition,
which, while vehement and wordy, remains always
vague, discordant and confused.
The Republican platform states specifically and dear
ly the policies for which it stands and which it promises
the people to carry out if intrusted with the administra
tion of the government. These policies are not only in
accord with one another, but they are consistent with the
record of the party ever since it was organized fifty
years ago. No voter has any doubt of what a Republi
can administration will do with respect to the mainte
nance of protection and sound money; the extension of
internal improvements, the upbuilding of and pros
perity of all lines of industry at home, the enforcement
of the Monroe doctrine throughout this hemisphere and
the conservation of our national prestige abroad. A
reading of the Democratic platform will on the other
hand disclose such vague declarations and promises on
all these points as will leave the reader utterly at a loss
to understand what is the promise of the party, or what
could be expected if it were entrusted with the gov
ernment.
The omission of any reference to the gold standard is
perhaps the most notable feature of the Democratic
platform, and it is not strange that Judge Parker has pro
tested against it, but it is by no means the most signifi
cant. The statements of the party with respect to revision
â¢of the tariff, the upbuilding of American merchant ma
rine, the government of the Philippine Islands and legis
lation with respect to trusts are all so clouded with a
multitude of words that no one will be able to draw from
them a clear and positive declaration concerning a single
one of those important issues.
The vagueness and uncertainty of the platform is em
phasized by the character of the man nominated for the
Presidency. No one knows what policy or what princi
ple of government is represented by Judge Parker. In
a discussion over the platform in committee Mr. Bryan
said that if David B. Hill were going to nominate a
gold-standard candidate for the Presidency he should
have a gold-standard platform, and Mr. Hill replied that
he did not know whether Judge Parker is for the gold
standard or not. When Bryan, with an amazement,
shared by the country, asked whether Mr. Hill had
never learned Judge Parker's views on finance. Hill re
plied he had never done so. Here then is a man whose
political views are so colorless and indefinite that his
personal friend and political backers not only do not
know what his opinions are upon one of the most im
portant questions of the day, but have never even so
much as thought it worth while to ask. The message
from him, coming to the convention after the nomination
was made, serves but as another illustration of the con
fusion in the minds of all concerned.
In presenting his name to the convention as a candi
date for the Presidency Mr. Martin Littleton, who nomi
nated Judge Parker, was very careful not. to promise
anything in his name or to venture upon even an intima
tion of what his political principles may be. In endeav
oring to evade a question which Mr. Littleton must have
known was on the lips of every one he said: "If you
ask me why he has been silent, I tell you it is because he
does not claim to be the master of the Democratic
party, but is content to be its servant. If you ask me
why he has not outlined a policy for this convention, 1
tell you that he does not believe that policies should be
dictated, but that sovereignty of the party is in the un
trammeled judgment and wisdom of its members. If
you ask me what his policy will be if elected, I tell you it
will be that policy which finds expression in the platform
of his party."
That is all that the country knew of the Democratic
candidate for the Presidency when he was nominated.
If ever a people were presented with "a pig
in a poke" the American people had that pre
sentation made to them in this instance. Here
is a political organization without harmony in its
own ranks, without consistency in its promises or in its
record, without a single definite statement in its plat
form, presenting to the American people as a candidate
for the chief executive office of the republic a man who
was so absolutely without a record upon any political
issue that his sponsors before the people were not able to
say for him anything more than the platitude that he ex
pects to be a "servant of the people."
It is hardly possible that a majority of Americans will
vote for such a candidate on such a platform backed by
such a party. This is a country of positive ideas, whose
people believe in action and who like to have a clear con
ception of what they are going to undertake. It may be
put down as a foregone conclusion that the series of Re
publican victories which began immediately upon the
panic years of the Democratic tariff will go on unbroken,
and that the administration of this country for the next
four years will continue in the hands of Theodore
Roosevelt and a Republican Congress.
first use he will make of his added in

The success of her novel, "The

have been got out of the way and she

published in the Philadelphia Public Ledger of June 29,
where a man, horror stricken at the irreligious dealers
of that city who sell ice to poor families on the Sabbath,
has undertaken their prosecution under an old statute,
a relic of the blue laws. The Ledger says:
"The thermometer registered 95 on Sunday, the hu
midity was unbearable, and that was the day the dealers
were, forbidden under penalty of prosecution and fine
to sell ice to the poor, the ill and the feeble. What is
the object of this peculiar and incomprehensible cru
sade? All that is known of it apparently is that one
George Vail is having the ice dealers arraigned before a
magistrate and having them fined under a statute of 1794
? * * What shall the poor people do? They are not
considered, hence they wondered at the conditions on
that killing day. They besieged the places where ice is
usually sold and surrounded the wholesale dealers' sup
plies and begged for it in vain. Last week thirty-seven
infants, an unusually large number, died from causes in
cident to hot weather and heat prostration." }
Such a picture is indeed a pitiable one. There may be
those who think the prosecutor, afflicted with zeal in a
good cause, has gone mad, or that he would better adorn
a place that cannot boast even as many snowballs as
Philadelphia on a June day. ; Meantime we of California
live on in the perfume of the mingled breath of the pines
and the Pacific and regret that our climatic elysium is
not enjoyed by all humanity.

A two-story frame building on Mis
sion street, near Twenty-ninth, was
totally destroyed by fire yesterday
forenoon. The structure waa used as
a laundry by a French company, em
ploying about seventy-flve hands, the
majority being: girls, all of whom
escaped from the place in safety. The
bookkeeper, v Miss Florence Francis,
showed presence of mind In securing
the books and cash before leaving her
station. She faced the mirror and
adjusted her hat while the smoke from
the burning building was darkening
the office. The cause of the fire Is un
known. The damage amounts to
about $12,000, which is partly covered
by insurance.

the effect that Marty's is still in an un

A. M. Oslo had George Lamont, a
milk distributor, arrested for threaten
ing to shoot him with a pistol loaded
with blank cartridges, and on the wit
ness stand Mr. Oslo showed such small
regard for the majesty of the court that
he brought upon himself a sharp repri
mand from the bench.
After the case had been dismissed
Oslo said in audible tones to Lamont,
"I'll fix you yet," and when the Judge
called him back and asked him what
he meant by the remark he stammered
something unintelligible.
"The first thing you know you'll be a
defendant in this court," Bald the
Judge. Oslo then promised to be good.
Down from Elko, Nev., came Bernard
McCloskey, tall and stalwart, and when
his money was all spent he begged for
food from housewives In the Western
Addition. Those who declined to feed
him he twitted with stinginess, and
when they attempted to escape his
tirade by shutting the door in his face
he prevented them doing so by placing
his foot Inside the portal. Judge Con
lan gave him a scathing lecture and six
months in the County Jail to digest It.
O. Evanson spent one of the recent
cold nights in a Washington street
lodging-house, and the bed coverings
being Insufficient to convey to his
emaciated body the degree of warth
essential to comfortable slumber, he
slyly pilfered a blanket from a neigh
boring bunk and spread It over him
self. Thus protected he slept soundly
until morning, when he Inadvertently
took away with him the extra blanket
and exchanged it for breakfast in a
Kearny street restaurant. Judge Mogan
will hear further details next Tuesday.
That incident occurred less than
month ago, and yesterday Josephine
Mahoney was before his Honor Judge
Conlan again on the same old charge.
She made no attempt to defend her
latest fall from grace. She simply
couldn't stay sober â that's all there wa3
to it, aud what was the use of talking,
anyway?
"Six months in the County Jail,"
sighed the Judge.
"I'll lay odds of three to one that you
can't reform her," said Judge Conlan
to "Rebel George," the evangelist, when
the latter pleaded for and obtained the
release of Josephine Mahoney, chronic
vagrant. George said he was no longer
a betting man else he might take the
wager.
After loving Frank Enos for two con
secutive years with all the warmth of
her Castilian soul, Pauline Gonzales
met Jason C. Russell, an ex-soldier, and
abruptly transferred her affection to
him. Frank â¢ whined, then pined and
finally became vengeful. Meeting the
fickle senorita and her new flame as
they walked arm-in-arm along Stock
ton street, near Pacific, last Friday
evening, the Jilted one struck his rival
a violent blow on the face, and by way
of retaliation was promptly knocked
down. Springing to his feet, Frank
drew a knife and was about to stab
Jason when Pauline's fingers became
entangled in his hair and restrained
him until the policeman came.
"He's ze bad man," chirruped Pau
line, pointing to Frank, who stood be
fore Judge Mogan, "and I fears me for
me life. I lufs heem not, and to jail
you please heem send."
"I'll think it over occasionally until
July .14," said his Honor, glancing at
the defendant, who looked as if he did
not particularly care whether he was
discharged or ordered to instant exe
cution when he saw Pauline escorted
from the courtroom by the stalwart
Jason.
was so weird that the bailiff did not
blame the defendant for desiring to
keep his head away from public view.
"Take him out and get the remainder
of his hair removed," said the Judge,
"and tell him to leave town until he
again needs the tonsor."
Mrs. Helen F. Barry, mother of five
children, told Police Judge Mogan yes
terday, that Michael J. Barry, a ma
chinist, from whom she waa divorced
last March, Is too mean to be permit
ted to roam at large and she would
like to have. his liberty curtailed. She
owns and manages a variety store at
1856 Fifteenth street and Mr. Barry al
leges that her miscellaneous stock In
trade includes whisky. This she de
nies and dares him to prove.
Fifteen years- ago the Barrys were
married and a twelvemonth later were
divorced. After two years of single
harness they were legally reunited and
from that time until they again were
separated by Judicial decree their do
mestic life was a steady succession of
jars. The court awarded the mother
possession of the children, but two of
the youngsters seceded and are dwell
ing with their father.
Ajfter the complaint had painted the
defendant's character a lusterless black
she was taken In hand by his attorney
and forced to say some things that she
evidently did not like to say. Not until
the Judge explained to her the defend
ant's right to have counsel and the
right of that counsel to question her
would she consent to cross-examina
tion and even then her answers were
given with 111 grace. It was true, she
acknowledged, that money given by
Barry established the general mer
chandise business that enabled her to
live and that he did protest against her
selling whisky and allowing scents
of drunken revelry to threaten con
tamination of his fifteen-year-old
daughter. While she denied the liquor
selling and the revelry, she confessed
that she had taken, out a Federal li
cense for the sale of intoxicants.
Barry stated that his object in visit
ing his former wife's place of business
was to see his three children and that
he paid her $5 for the window he had
smashed after she locked the door
against him. Yes, he had been drink
ing, but that was no reason . why he
should be refused permission to see his
progeny. If their custodian were a
total abstainer there might be logical
excuse for her declination to admit him
to their presence. He had it on ex
cellent authority, however, ' that the
flowing bowl circulated frequently in
the "variety store" and that his little
ones could scarcely avoid cognizance
of its effects upon those who sipped.
The Judge opined . that Mr. Barry's
plea was rather debilitated, inasmuch
as it was based upon the theory that
two wrongs make a right â that one
fault justifies another. Even . if the
children in the mother's custody were
"They say that I serve my steaks '
raw," muttered Kolasak. "Ha, ha! This
one will be cooked to a turn." j
Mike seized his hat and took the 30
cents from the till. Then, after locking '
the place, he went south to parts un- |
known. Sheriff Curtis was ordered to
take possession of the hashery for 575
which the proprietor owed his landlady.
While the legal forms were being at
tended to the steak continued to fry. It
scented the neighborhood with an ap
petizlng aroma. Hoboes crowded the .
sidewalk to whiff the odor and wax fat
thereon. And it is still frying.
A deputy sheriff arrived yesterday,
but under the law he may not enter the j
chophouse until Monday morning at 10'
o'clock! Meanwhile the steak will sizzle j
on the pan. It ought to be cooked to a j
turn when removed. j
There is much discussion at the Sher- .
iff's office as to the disposal of this j
well-cooked tidbit If the landlady does
not want it the steak will be preserved
as the longest short-order on record i
and the first chophouse product that
was not underdone. I
On Thursday afternoon Mike's chop
house was deserted and the proprietor
gave up hope. Chipping off a chunk of
the "round," he sftftened it on the an
vil and put It in the pan. Lighting the
gasburner under it, he sat down to
brood over his troubles.
For once a chophouse beefsteak will
not be underdone. In the restaurant of
"Mike" Kolasak, at 8 Union street, a
piece of beefsteak has been frying sine*
last Thursday. It will sizzle on the pan
till Monday morning. The law has
said It.

Ulysses K. Jerome, booked for va
grancy and assigned to Judge Fritz for
trial, sent ,. word from the prison that
he would like to be excused from ap*
pearlng in court, as he knew he looked
like a "guy." and did not desire to be
made â¢ laughing-stock for the bench
warmers.
' "What's the matter with his looks?"
inquired the Judge.
Bailiff Conlan described Mr. Jerome's
appearance. . When arrested early yes
terday morning at Pine and Kearny
streets the ,: defendant was stupidly
drunk and his head bore evidence of
some practical joker having ran a bar
ber's I clipper crisscross through the
thick: hair until the cranium looked as
if it had been platted. Three avenues,
about two inches in width and three
inches apart, were shorn from the fore
head, to the', nape of the neck, and an
equal number of bare streaks extended
across the skull. The general effect
"The 2-year-old baby," said Miss
Fisher,- "has been starved and neglect
e<Sso that. it. is no larger than a fair
sized doll, and its eyes are dilated in a
way that indicates alcoholic poison-
Ing."
"This Is , one of the most distressing
cases that has ever been brought to my
attention," said the Judge, "and I will
continue it till Tuesday in order to as
certain just how much of it the chil
dren's father is responsible for."
Miss Lucy B. Fisher, a visiting nurse
for the Associated Charities, told Judge
Conlan such a story of Mrs. Mary Proc
tor's maternal neglect that his Honor
expressed horror and ordered the
woman into custody for further exam
ination next Tuesday.
Mrs. Proctor and her husband,
Charles, a stableman, live at 260 Ship
ley street, and for years she has been a
drunkard. She has three children-
George, aged 7 years; Edith, aged 5
years, and Gladys, aged 2 yearsâ and
they were naked, hungry and fllthy
when Miss Fisher found them alone in
the house, the mother being absent on
a spree. Gladys, who Is affected with
tuberculosis, was sent to a hospital,
and the other little ones to an institu
tion for homeless children.
permitted to witness drunkenness, that
was all the more reason why their
father should not appear before them
in drunken condition. If he were sin
cerely solicitous that his flfteen-year
old daughter should be kept aloof from
drunkards and drunkenness, why was
he drunk when he went to visit her?
His practice was inconsistent with his
precept. Then the case was continued
till next Friday.

BEAUTIFUL SOCIETY GIRL. AND HEIRESS OF THIS CITY. WHO COMMTTTTIO
SUICIDE IN A TRAGIC MANNER IN NEW YORK CITY WHILE SUFFER
ING FROM AN ACUTE ATTACK OF NEURASTHENIA.
The. news of Miss Bertha Dolbeer's
tragic end comes as a shock to local
society. She was exceedingly popular
and well liked among the members of
the younger set.
Apparently Â¦ Miss Dolbeer had every
thing to live for. On the death of her
father, John Dolbeer, the lumberman,
she Inherited a fortune of over a mil
lion dollars. \ All that money could
buy was within her reach.:
Her beauty . drew . suitors whom the
NEW YORK, July 9.â Though an
heiress to millions and with no ap
parent griefs, Miss Bertha Dolbeer of
San Francisco flung herself from a
window on the ninth floor of the Wal
dorf Hotel. She was Instantly killed.
After an investigation Coroner Scholer
declared it was a case of suicide.
The woman's body fell on the cement
roof over the celling of the red room,
where other women patrons of the hotel
were writing at the time. Â¦
But for a very ordinary mischance
Miss Warren, cousin and companion of
Miss Dolbeer, might have been able to
prevent the fatal leap. Miss Warren's
skirt was caught on the knob and the
key of the door of their apartment as
she was following Miss Dolbeer Into a
corridor. While her attention was at
tracted in disentangling her dress and
before she had succeeded In doing so
the other woman walked across the
hotel corridor, stepped upon the broad
side of a window opening |On the air
shaft and disappeared.
Turing from the door to follow her
cousin, Miss Warren saw her body
disappear through: a window.' She
screamed and started to run toward
the window, but fell In a dead faint be
fore she reached it.
"Suicide while suffering from neuras
thenia," was the verdict of the Cor
oner's jury. That Miss Dolbeer jumped
from the window, and did not fall, was
also the statement of Miss Warren to
Detective Sergeant Cornelius Sullivan
of the' West Thirtieth street police sta-
After the Coroner's Inspection the
body was taken to an undertaking
establishment and prepared for re
moval to San Francisco, where inter
ment will be made. No friends or rela
tives of Miss Dolbeer except Miss War
ren live In New York, or nearer than
San Francisco. Miss Warren commu
nicated with relatives in the latter city.
Miss Dolbeer was 28 years old and the
only child of the late John Dolbeer of
San Francisco.
world called desirable to her feet and
women admitted her graciousness. But
there were times when she became
moody. Once she expressed a con
tempt for mankind to an intimate
friend, saying that she feared that men
liked her only for her money.
One of her most persistent suitors
was Samuel Hewston, now a Chicago
millionaire. Seven years ago he was
an ardent aspirant for the affections of
the young heiress. So marked were
his attentions and so gracious was
Miss Dolbeer to him that tongues be
gan to wag. Suddenly and unaccount
ably he was dismissed. About a year
ago Milton Latham became particular
ly attentive to Miss Dolbeer, but â¢noth
ing came of it.
Friends scoff at the idea that, the
young lady ended her life because of
an 'unfortunate love affair. She was of
a cheerful disposition when not in one
of her moods. She loved the open air
and every form of athletics. She was
an expert golfer and. ran her own auto
mobile. Before she left on her recent
trip to Europe she sold her machine
and ordered one cf a more recent make
to be ready on her return. A few
months prior to her departure fronj this
city Miss Dolbeer complained of sharp
pains across her eyes and forehead.
This fact may throw some light on her
suicide.
Thirteen years ago' her mother was
found dead in a bathtub.
The case did not go before the Coro
ner, but it was whispered that there
were indications of suicide.
Miss Dolbeer was 2S years of age and
a native of California.. Her father,
John Dolbeer, amassed several millions
of dollars in the lumber trade, most
of which he left to her on his death
in 19Q2.
Since his death Miss Dolbeer, who
was an only child, had been living
quietly at the family residence at 2112
Pacific street, until she started on her
European trip in quest of health and
found death on her return to this coun
try. Her only close companion, since
the demise of her father, was Miss
Warren, her cousin. It was at one time
rumored that this lady came very: near
becoming Miss j Dolbeer's stepmother.
The only surviving relative of the
unfortunate heiress in this city is
Mrs. Douglas Sloan Watson -" 2732
Vallejo street. Mrs. Watson, who is
a first cousin to the dead girl, was not
at home last night.
The deep â¢; regret for Miss Dolbeer's
tragic end' is universal in this city and
It, will, be some time -before her friends
in * the younger * set will recover from
the shock
may be misplaced because on one oc
casion when a selMmportant attache
arbitrarily asserted his authority in
holding up bills the directors bor
rowed $25,000 from a well known
bank and paid the creditors. The
banker had faith in the Government
and advanced the money.
In reference to the deficiency, Hugh
M. Burke, chairman of the library
and amusement committee of the
board, remarks: "The canteen, yield
ing a profit of $S00 a month, was abol
ished through a misleading statement
made on the floor of Congress by Rep
resentative Bell; hence the directors
suggested to the Governor the advis
ability of a deficiency for books,
amusements, band and certain help in
the hospital until the Legislature
should convene. The Governor ex
pressed the opinion that everything
possible should be done to promote'
the happiness of the veterans at the
home. It was explained that the can
teen, which paid for the books, the
band, entertainments and waiters in
the hospital dining-room, had been
abolished. There was bo much halr
splitlng at Sacramento and so many
rambling; and verbose objections that
the board cut out the entertainments
and books and resolved to cut out the
band on August 1. The suggestion for
a deficiency is therefore withdrawn."
The directors serve the State with
out any compensation other than that
which comes to a man who Is con
scious that he has performed his duty
to his fellow-man. It is a source of
regret to the board that the subordi
nates of the "State administration are
not satisfied with the management of
the home. In Napa County the sa
loonmen near the home are fighting
for the pensions of living veterans and
the little lawyers of the county are
banding together to exploit the estates
of the dead.
Since Governor Pardee went away
on his vacation an ermy of deputy
governors has taken the field in Sac
ramento and the leaders of this new
army take the view that the old sol
diers at Tountville should be placed
on an exact footing with inmates of
prisons, reformatory institutions and
asylums for the insane. The directors
hold to the view that the best the land
affords Is none too good for the old
veterans. Moreover, supplies will be
purchased to the extent of the Gov
ernment allowance. The directors do
not question the right of the State
Board of Examiners to hold up the
bills until the Government money
comes, but they contend that the
statement wired from Sacramento is
misleading and uncallr for. More
over, the sympathy extended to the
creditors by the Sacramento officials
Five or six weeks ago a dispatch
similar to the foregoing was sent from
Sacramento and it was immediately
contradicted by Mr. Melick. Reasons,
political or otherwise, may exist for
creating a false impression concerning
the management of the institution, but j
the directors assert that "the finances
are not in bad shape and that no de
ficiency exists and none shall be
created without the full consent of the
Governor and State Board of Ex
eminers.
The. directors assert positively that
the Federal and State allowances have
rot been exceeded. The United States
allowance approximates JSO.OOO per an
num and comes in quarterly install
ments. The State Treasurer has not
received anything from the General
Government for the first and second
quarters of 1904. In this respect Cali
fornia fares the same as other States.
The nation is good for the amount
allowed by Congress and when the
authorities cf the Treasury Depart
ment in Washington, D. C, get ready â¢
they will forward the money to the
several States.
FINANCIAL CONDITION.
General S. W. Backus, president of
the board of directors, was asked yes
terday to submit an exact statement
concerning the financial affairs of the
Institution and here are the figures I
presented:
State fund. July 1. 1904â
Credit July 1 â Balance on baud at
Sacramento ? 432 07
DuÂ» from the United States for the
quarter enSini? March 31. 1904 18,646 00
Due from the United States for the
Quarter endlr-g June 30. 1904 17.E23 00
Total 136.061 07
Estimated annual doflclency In Unit
ed States appropriation........ .... 5.500 00
Balance available .$31.461 07
April bills "fll.466 82
May bllli 8.921 80
Juca t:..b 8.973 36
Total $30,362 00
Leaving balance to credit of the
borne in State treasury of 51099 07.
'This slight balance," says Mr.
Backus, "will be regulated more or
less by what the deficiency may be In
the United States appropriations. This
ffeneraUy averages $5500, which sum
the State always gets when Congress
meets and makes its annual deficiency
appropriations."
It should be noted that the Federal ,
allowance is not paid directly to the
Veterans' Home. The general Gov
ernment i ays it to the State of Cali
fornia, hence It was the custom of
previous State administrations to per
mit the use of the State's allowance of
$55,000 per annum pending the re
ceipt of the Government money. Now,
under the decision of subordinates at
Sacramento and in accordance with
the views of a deputy in the Attorney
General's office, only one-twelfth of
the State's allowance can be used each
month. This ruling carried to its log
ical conclusion would deprive the vet
erans of food and clothing until the
Government allowance reached the
State treasury, because the State al
lowance of $55,000 per year to the
Veterans' Home Is Quite meaner.
One of the directors remarked:
â¢"The free-handed, generous appropri
ations made by California for the an
nual support of such Institutions as
the Attorney General's office, the Con
troller's office and the office of the
secretary of the State Board of Ex
aminers do not apply to the Veterans'
Home. If the per capita allowance at
Yountville was equal to the per capita
appropriation for the maintenance of
the Attorney General's office, for ex
ample, the veterans would receive
more than $1,000,000 a year from the
State."

Through the sudden and tragic
death of President General Jose Maria

him the admiration of his countrymen.
General Prosper Morales, an aspirant

Scottish Rite Masonry had a glori
ous outing yesterday, the occasion be
ing the laying of the cornerstone of
the Albert Pike Memorial Temple on
Geary street, between Fillmore and
Steiner. The ceremonies were con
ducted by the Grand Lodge, Free and
Accepted Masons of California, and
the grand officers were escorted to the
site by a large concourse of Masons
of the York Rite and the Scottish Rite.
Albert Pike was grand commander
of the Supreme Council, A. and A. S.
R., with headquarters at Charleston,
S. C. Many years ago he and H. C.
Caswell went to England and con
ferred the thirty-second degree of
Freemasonry upon King Edward, then
the Prince of Wales. Albert Pike, out
side his great services to the order,
is best known by his book, "Morals
and Dogma." It is a comprehensive
system of Masonic philosophy, advo
cating the principles enunciated in the
Scottish Rite motto, "Liberty, equalitiy
and fraternity." The work is used as
a textbook in all bodies of the rite
and has been translated into the lan
guage of every civilized people on the
face of the globe.
The Memorial Temple will be the.
home of the four "California" bodies
of the rite, namely: California Lodge
of Perfection No. 10, organized Octo
ber 1, 1902, Franklin B. Ladd, thirty
third degree, venerable master; Cali
fornia Chapter No. 7, Knights Rose
Croix, organized February 10, 1903,
Walter A. Scott, thirty-second degree,
wise master; California Council No. 7,
Knights Kadosh, organized July 8,
1903, Louis A. Murch, thirty-second
degree, preceptor, and California Con
sistory No. 5, organized August 18,
1903, Fred J. H. Rickon, thirty-third
degree, commander.
The original Scottish Rite bodies,
out of which the California bodies
were taken, turned out a large delega
tion to escort their brethren. There
were represented Yerba Buena Lodge
of Perfection No. 1, Yerba Buena
Chapter, Knights Rose Crolx; God
frey de St. Omar Council, Knights
Kadosh, and San Francisco Consistory,
under command of William P. Filmer,
thirty-second degree, and F. H. Kees
ling, thirty-second degree. ?
. In the van of the parade was Cali
fornia Comandery, Knights Templar,
preceded by a column of Knights
mounted on black horses. Then fol
lowed delegations from Golden Gate
Commandery, Knights Templar; the
Royal Arch and Blue lodges and the
Scottish Rite bodies, whose rich and
brilliant uniforms elicited admiring,
comment.
The ceremonies at the site were con
ducted by the Grand Lodge of Califor
nia (York Rite) ; Charles W, Nutting,
grand master; George Johnson, grand
secretary; Edward Coleman, grand
treasurer; Rabbi Nleto, grand , chap
lain, and others. Fred J. H. Rickon,
commander of the "California" bodies
of the Scottish Rite, made the address
of welcome to the grand master, 'and
the cornerstone was laid with the
usual Masonic ceremonies.
George Varcoe (thirty-second de
gree), San Francisco Consistory, de
livered an address, in which he spoke
with feeling of the principles and work
of Freemasonry and particularly em
phasized the motto of the Scottish
Rite; "Liberty, equality and frater
nity,"
Commander Rickon In his address
quoted the following words of Albert
Pike:
"When I am dead I wish my monu
ment to be bullded only in the hearts
and memories of my brethren of the
Ancient Scottish Rite, and my name
to be remembered by them in every
country, no matter what language
men speak there, where the light of
the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite
shall sh.'ne, and Its oracles of truth
and wisdom be reverently listened to."

Doyle's scratch three-bagger and
Sheehan's single brought in the Tigers'

Tacoma helped San Francisco to its
first run. A base on balls gave them
a start for their second and clean hit

was devoid of sensational features
other than three fast double plays,

Melville Long and Robert Drolla
played the longest and closest match
of the day. After losing the first two
sets by a score of 7-5, Drolla pulled out
the next three. The third set was 12-10
and was the closest of the day.
The public courts at the park were in
great demand and as usual there was
a large waiting list. The feature was
a round robin in which three' crack
teams figured. The contestants were
R. N. Whitney and A. H. Brabant,
Clarence Griffin and Carl Gardner and
Ed Finneg-n and Charles Foley. Each
team won one match and lost two,
making the affair a tie all around.
In the first match, all of which were
one-set affairs, Whitney and Brabant
beat Flnnegan and Foley, 6-4. Foley
and Flnnegan in turn beat Gardner and
Griffin, 6-2. In the third match Griffin
and Gardner, to the surprise of all, beat
Whitney and Brabant, 6-0.
One of the best sets in mixed doubles
ever seen at the park was played in the
afternoon. Miss M. Wocester and Clar
ence Griffin beat Miss S. Fuchs and
Charles Foley, 13-1L Miss Wocester is
a novice at the game but showed con
siderable skill. She is a left-handed'
player and with practice will become
quite an expert.
On the California Club courts there
were some interesting matches in both
singles and doubles. Dr. Harold Hill
and Herbert Long put up the best ex
hibition in singles. The doctor has al
ways been considered more of a star in
the double courts than in singles, but
he has been coming to the front of late
and rarely loses a singles match. He
played a clever game against Long and
won two sets out of three. The score
is a peculiar one, as each be.Â« the
other a 6-1 set. Hill took the third
without losing a game.
Sidney Salisbury and Harry Rolfe
played a fast doubles match with Ray
Cornell and Herbert Long. When dark
ness set in the score stood two sets to
to one and 5-5 in favor of Salisbury
and Rolfe. Â¦>'."-
H. Long and Rolfe played a close
set with Dr. Hill and Charles Kuehn.
Kuehn, although a class below the
other three, played a good game and
supported Hill well. Rolfe and Long
won after sixteen game's had been
played.

SEATTLE, July 9. â It was easy
sailing for Oakland. to-day. , Owing to
Francks being out of the same with
a broken finger, Lohman played
three pitchers â Graham, Moskiman
and Schmidt. Before the lineup was
finally settled Moskiman had tried
three positions, Streib two and Schlaf

Schlafiey's hit with the bases full
was the star feature of the game. He
made three bases without effort, but
in trying for a home run was caught
at the plate. The score:

CHICAGO, July 9.â Without a stake
race on the programme at Harlem to
day the sport was rather tame and un
interesting. "Big Bill" Knapp out of
five mounts rode three winners and
was twice second. "Kansas" Price
sprung a coup In the second race in
his gelding Allen Avon, which he re
cently claimed from "Pa" Bradley and
which won, backed down from 60 to 1 to
25. to 1 at post time. The killing was
enjoyed by only a select few, who got
their money down with a rush at long
odds. The big speculators and form
players could not concede Allen Avon
a chance in his race of yesterday and
Handzarra was well backed at the
short price of 9 to 20. He opened at
7 to 20 and went as high at one time as
1 to 2.
Bearcatcher, the California speed
marvel, with which T. G. Ferguson had
hopes of winning the American Derby
until the colt went lame, made his ap
pearance to-day after a rest of several
months and won the third race easilv
from Fairfleld. It was the first time
the son of St. George-Sallie McAllister
had been asked to go a mile, but he
performed his task wonderfully well.
Helgesen, who had the mount, got him
off flying and at no time was the result
left in doubt. He had a lead of two
and one-half lengths all the way and
at the end was leading by a length, still
full of running. Summaries:

track was, the fastest in Its history to
day. Tire feature event on the card
was the Brighton handicap. Broom
stick, the three-year-old, won the race
from the lame Irish Lad and made a
new world's record, 2:02 4-6. for one and
one-quarter miles, and ran the most
remarkable race ever witnessed upon
the American turf.
The horse which made the pace for
the victor and fell only a few Inches
behind at the finish ran with a ringbone
developing:. He was suffering agony in
those final strides. It was the pain
which at last defeated Irish Lad, and
it is the- belief of many racegoers that
if he had been coaxed and encouraged
toward the last instead of being
whipped he would not have swerved
and thus lost the most valuable handi
cap of the year.
There were cheers for Broomstick and
his wonderful "performance, yet the vol
ume of applause was. hardly less great
.for the son of Candlemas, second In the
race, as he limj>ed back from the sen
sational performance which probably
closes his turf career. Highball was
third, while Waterboy, the favorite of
trie public, failed to defend his last
year's title and his record of 2:03 1-5,
made on the same track.
All attendance records were broken
at the races to-day, for never was so
large a throng seen at the old race
track. Fully 25,000 spectators were
present despite the limited facilities.

Corinthian wins by I â¢ - 07 41
The race was under the manage
ment of the regatta committees of the
two clubs, the representatives of the
San Francisco Yacht Club being Dr.
T. L. Hill. Roy C. Ward and C. M.
Gunn and those of the Corinthian
Yacht Club being T. J. Kavanagh, !
James K. Bulger and Alex J. Young.
The referee was Allen M. Clay of the
Corinthian Yacht Club. The commit
tees and about 300 spectators wit
nessed the race from the steamer Res
olute. Everything passed off without
a hitch, the general expression of
opinion being that no better^ sailed,
better managed nor more interesting
yacht race had ever been seen on the
bay.
The winning sloop Corinthian was
designed by Burgess & Packard of
Boston and was built by Frank Stone
of this city. She is a shallow craft of
the scow type, 56 feet 6 inches over
all, 24 feet on the water line, with 14
feet beam and a draft of 2 feet. She
has a centerboard with a drop of 8
feet. W. G. Morrow's Challenger is
a fin keel sloop designed by B. B.
Crownlnshleld of Boston and built in
this city by Twigg & Spns. She is 42
feet over all, 24 feet on the water
line, with a beam of 9 feet and a draft
of 7 feet. She carries 964 square feet
of canvas. â¢
The winning boat was sailed by
Frank Stone, her crew being Commo
dore T. Jennings, Vice Commodore J.
C. Brlckell, Douglas Erskine, Neill
McLean, J. Short and^ F. E. Schober.
The Challenger wassailed by Com
modore "W. G. Morrow, her crew being
ex-Commodore R. S. Bridgman, Har
ry Helen, Hillyer Deuprey, J. C. Cock*
erlll, W. W. Farrar and W. "W. Haley.
Most bt the race was sailed on an
ebb tide^ but the finish was on a flood
tide, it being low water at 1:52 p. m.
at Fort Point. The supporters of the
Challenger thought that a heavier
wind and rougher sea would have
been more favorable to her. This
opinion was strengthened by the fact
that on the second beat out to, Pre
sidio Shoal buoy, when the breeze was
strongest and the water roughest, she
gained 46 seconds.
In a splendid race sailed on the
bay yesterday the sloop Corinthian,
challenger for the San Francisco per
petual challenge cup, the blue ribbon
of Pacific Coast Yachting, ' defeated
the sloop Challenger by the narrow
margin of forty-one seconds. Only one
race for the trophy has been closer.
In 1901 the Corinthian sloop Presto
beat the Vallejo sloop Helen by forty
seconds. The breeze was only mod
erately strong, though it freshened
somewhat toward the close of the race.
The water was smooth. â¢
At 12:26 p. m. the preparatory sig
nal was given from the judges' boat
and at 12:80 p. m. the starting signal,
the yachts being allowed two minutes
within which to cross the line without
penalty. The yachts had been
maneuvering off the Powell-street
wharf for nearly an hour and at
12:31:14 p. m. Frank Stone sent the
Corinthian across the line. W. G.
Morrow's sloep Challenger followed at
12:31:49 p. m., or thirty- five seconds
later. On the broad reach to the stake
boat Presto, anchored three miles due
north from Pewell-street wharf and off
Point Blunt. Angel Island, the Corin
thian gained one minute seven seconds,
rounding the mark at 12:52:43 p. m.,
while the Challenger rounded . at
12:54:25 p. m.
CORINTHIAN ROUNDS STAKE.
The second leg of the course was
a beat out to Presidio Shoal buoy,
which the Corinthian rounded at
1:41:28 p. m. and the Challenger at
1:43:52 p. m. On this leg the Corin
thian gained forty-two seconds. The
stakeboat Surprise, anchored over the
site of Blossom Rock, was rounded by
the Corinthian at 2:05:58 p. m., the
Challenger rounding the mark at
2:09:01 p. m. The^Corlnthian gained
thirty-nine seconds on the run. On the
second beat out the Corinthian round
ed Presidio Shoal buoy at' 2:38:31
p.m. and the Challenger at 2:40:48
p. m. On this leg the Challenger gain
ed forty-six seconds. On the run home
the Corinthian crossed the finishing
line at 2:55:43 p. m. and the Chal
lenger at 2:59:03. On this leg the
Challenger lost one minute three sec
onds.
The elapsed time of the Corinthian
over the whole course was 2 hours 24
minutes 29 seconds, and of the Chal
lenger 2 hours 27 minutes 14 seconds.
As the Corinthian, the racing length of
which is 29.91 feet, as given in the let
ter of challenge, gave an allowance of
2 minutes 4 seconds to the Challenger,
the racing length of which is 28.60
feet, the corrected time of the Chal
lenger for the whole course was 2
hours 25 minutes 10 seconds. The
Corinthian won by forty-one seconds,
corrected time.
The comparative times for each leg
PORTLAND, Or., July 9.â Such a
roast as Umpire Tom Brown received
from the fans this afternoon was a
caution. Language proved insufficient
for some of them, and empty pop bot
tles flew about like sheila at be
leaÂ§ruered Port Arthur. A wild-eyed
aggregation gathered about him at the
close of the same and told Brown he
was all sorts of a robber and a thief.
Ike Butler was given all he wanted
I in the first inning. He hit Toman and
two singles and a double followed. The
umpire seemed to guard the Loo-Loo
interests with a zealous eye and pre
vented the Portlands overcoming the
lead. Iberg succeeded Butler and
pitched a steady, effective game. The

The Commissioner said such a truck
will have to hold from six to eight
cubic yards, have a steel and water
tight cover and be built low down.
Manufacturers of steam, electric, pe
troleum, steam turbine and even a
liquid air man are trying to win the
prize by producing the best truck- No
time limit has been set, and no detailed
specifications have been given.
"I believe within four or five years
we will be able to do away with all the
present horses and trucks," said Dr.
"Woodbury to-day, "and all we want is
a practical vehicle. We want one -that
will do the work and be no more ob
jectionable than the present system.
"We have now 1165 one-horse carts
which carry one and a half cubic
yards; twenty-seven two-horse trucks
which hold four cubic yards, and 1621
horses.. Our horses cost us about $250
eachâ the last batch 5270. The advan

R. Clement Lucas, the senior surgeon
at Guy's Hospital. London, elves the
details In a recent Issue of a medical
Journal of two cases treated at Guy's,
In which painful operations were neces
sary to remove cancers from the breast.
In the first case the patient worked
at a fur factory, and "for many hours
every day her arm was carried back
ward and forward in her work, and her
pectoral muscle, moving to and fro
while she leaned over her desk, pressed
the soft tissue against the upper edgs
of her corset." The second instance was
similar, and the hard tumor "corre
sponded exactly with the friction level
of the upper edge of the corset as It
crossed the margin of the pectoralia
major muscle."
air. Lucas sets forth these examples
as further proofs of the theory that
cardnamo (cancer) is "apt to attack
those parts whose vitality has been,
lowered or the power of resistance les
sened by chronic Irritation." Doubtless
this Is the reason why "cancer of tho
lower lip rarely occurs except In pipe
smokers." Corset and pipe have much
to answer for. so far as health Is con
cerned â especially corset.
It may be laid down as a general
principle that It Is dangerous for any
part of the body to be subjected to
chronic pressure or Irritation. Stiff,
chafing collars on the bacK of the neck
produce bolls and carbuncles. Just as
Irritating corsets develop cancer of the
breast. â London Globe.

One more overdue ship has come in
and a reinsurance of 15 per cent will be
paid. It was the Montebello, 182 days
out from Swansea. She was reported
in sight outside the harbor and will be
in port early this morning.
Overdue Montebello Sighted.
The Pacific Mail steamship Acapulco
sailed yesterday for Panama and Mexi
can ports. She carried 2600 tons of
freight, among which were 600 tons of
f.our and 1750 barrels of wine. Her
cabin passengers are as follows: Peter
Bryan, A. del Toro, William Roach,
D. YÂ»~. Rohm, J. Hawkins, R. Cabrera,
E. Cabrera, Joaquin Cabrera, A. I*
Scott, W. Bradbury, J. T. Sullevan.
George Ray Xewcomb and wife, S.

The Xewcombs had a run of it to
come from Santa Cruz yesterday morn
ing, procure a marriage license, get
wedded and catch the Acapulco by
automobile before she sailed. As it
was the company obligingly held the
steamer at the wharf forty-five min

pulled away so quickly that the rice
thrown at the couple fell into the bay.
Mrs. Newcomb was Miss Florence

are bound for New York, the home of
the groom.
Sailing of the Acapulco.
The society also furnisnes guards for
stock yards, warehouses, sew buildings
and business blocks. The expenses for
the service of the guards depend upon
the number of visits maae during the
night and also upon the extent of the
property guarded. Ordinarily the
houses are examined at least three
times during each nis:ht and every hour
if required. The schedule of prices
ranges from 59 cents a month for a
house with one entrance and S3 cents a
rncnth for a hou>-e with two entrances,
â¢with a charge of 12 cents a month for
every additional door, to $1 78 per
month for a chatteau and grounds and
$3 Â£7 per month for a large warehouse.
Should a member of the family in
any of the guarded houses return home
during the night without a key it is the
guard's duty to admit the person into
his home, as the guards carry a dupli
cate key for each subscriber's house.
In case the guard discovers fire it is
his duty to arouse the inmates and to
send in a fire alarm.
During the night a guard makes
several visits to the home of each sub
ecriber-ar.d if an outside door is found
open during one of these visits it is
the duty of the guard to see whether
any suspicious person has entered the
house and before he leaves to lock the
dcor, or, if necessary, to arouse the in
mates.
A Eociety has been organized in
Etrassburg the object of which Is to
mutually protect the members from
burglars or visits from suspicious char
acters during the night and to qive the
alarm in case of fire. United tiates
Consul Brittain at Kiel has made a re
port on the subject to the State Depart
ment. It appears that the society em
ploys a number of trustworthy guards,
v.ho are furnished with uniforms and
are required to give bond for the honest
aiid faithful performance of their du
ties. These watchmen, or guards, go
on duty at 10 p. m. and remain on duty
until 6 a. m. during the winter months
and until 5 a. m. during the summer
months.

The Pacific Mail steamship Barra
couta came in yesterday from Panama
and San Diego, she having called in
at the last port to repair disabled ma
chinery, which put her one day late.
Dr. Estes of the wrecked Pacific Mail
steamship Colon was a passenger
from the Central American coast.
The following Is the list of her cabin
passengers: Julius Halle, Arthur G.
Smith, Singleton Husted. Albert Linde
man, Emalla Lindeman, Theodora Pa
dilla, Mary E. Smith, Thomas
Matthews, Minerva E. Lu'dington and
Henry A. Barclay.
Arthur G. Smith is an electrical en
gineer from Lima, Peru, where he has
been superintending the building of
an electric railroad from Lima to
Callao and nearby towns. He speaks
in gloomy terms of the general con
dition of Peru. The existence of the
bubonic plague in the large cities of
the republic is assisting in the busi
ness depression of the country. Five
new cases a day is the general average
of the spread of the contagion. The
people are unprogressive and the
splendid mineral resources are scarce
ly developed. In politics there are
numerous candidates and would-be
dictators ever on top. The guano beds
were , long ago exhausted and ' the
niter deposits of Tarapaca, over which
Peru and Chile fought years ago, are
lying idle. According to the terms of
the treaty entered into between the
two countries the Government which
would comply with certain conditions
and make a payment of Â£5,000,000
should have the deposit*. Peru has
no money and Chile will not dig up
the cash. Like two dogs in. the
manger they will not pay nor will
they permit each other to acquire the
rich province on coinless conditions.
An election In the near future will
probably carry a revolution In attend
ance.

KAXSAS CITY. July 9.-â The flood
waters at Armourdale, Argentine and
lower Kansas City, Kans., on the rag
ing Kaw and west to Manhattan, half
way across Kansas, have fallen stead
ily since late yesterday and to-day con
tinue to recede. The water at Man
hattan became stationary at midnight,
after rising 6teadily all day yesterday,
and then began to go down, eliminat
ing the last danger of further damage
at the mouth of the Kaw or along Its
course.
The Missouri River at Kansas City
and north also receded fast, and no
additional damage to Harlem or the
cast bottoms will result from the over
flow of that stream. On the west bot
toms, on the Missouri side, where the
flood resulted from backwater from
the Kaw, the fall was more noticeable
than elsewhere, and at the big whole
sale houses confidence was restored
and the merchants began to return the
goods hurriedly taken away at the first
eign of danger.
The railroads are recovering and to
day every line west and south of Kan
sas City operated some trains in and
out of Kansas City, although with lit
tle regard to schedule. Railroad of
ficials and business men whose inter
ests were affected cay the damage lo
cally to property is insignificant when
compared with last year's losses.
WICHITA, Kans.. July 9. â The flood
situation In Wichita to-day shows lit
tle change. The Little River receded
shortly after midnight, but an early
rnoming downpour caused the back
water to go back to its old mark.
WASHINGTON. July 9. â Acting
upon a report from General Bell, who
investigated the conditions at KanT-as
City, growing out of the flood. Acting
Secretary of War Oliver has tele
graphed General Bell to issue 1000
tents and five days' rations for the re
lief of the flood sufferers. The supplies
will be drawn from Leavenworth. This
is an emergency measure and will be
followed by further relief, IX neces

The Pacific Coast steamship Queen
made a bray* ehow yesterday as she
passed among the racing yachts in
the bay on her way to Puget Sound
ports. This is her second trip since
her disastrous fire off Tillamook L'ght
February 27, when fourteen persons
were burned to death. She was the
Queen of the Pacific when she first
camearound the Horn twenty-two years
ago, but the name was shortened to
one word. On her first trio north,
with her owner aboard, she grounded
on Columbia River bar and lost a por
tion of her cargo. Once she almost
filled, with water from an open port
and she has been in collision with sev
eral other vessels. With all her misfor
tunes she sails the seas one of the
prettiest steamers that goes in and
out of this harbor.
PAETIALITY IS SHOWS
Clearing Weather and Sub
siding Waters in Wheat
Country Pleases Operators
NEW YORK, July 9. â Prices ad
vanced again to-day " in sympathy
with the prominent stocks and there
was considerable buying of the stocks
that led the market through the week.
The purchase of large blocks of these
stocks kept alive the impression that
there was an organized movement to
advance them. The operators showed
some partiality for the so-called Mor
gan shares, following the large buy
ing of Reading yesterday. In com
pany with the buying of United States
Steel preferred there was a large de
mand for Pennsylvania and the rest
of the list moved narrowly, but held
generally above last night's level un
til the appearance of the bank state
ment, when prices slightly sagged. The
market . hardened In the final hours
and closed steady. Clearing weather
and subsiding waters in the "wheat
country were regarded with satisfac
tion and contributed to the firmness
of the market.

What Jle'd 1 Really Do.
It was a quiet Sunday morning and
the children's voices rang out clearly
from > the corner where they sat side by
side. The little boy was only 3 years
old. and his English sounded some
thing more like "Hawaiian than what
he meant it for, so his sister needed a
large amount of patience to coach him
in his Sunday-school answers. Some
dozens of times she had gone over the
long answers and heard his solemn ren
dering, down to the question of what
he would do if he saw God coming.
"I'd fall down and worship him,"
came the reply, with the perfection of
much practice.
At last the older child laid aside the
book with a contented sigh. Her blue
ticket was assured. She took her
brother's face between her hands and
turning it up to her own asked:
"Now, say, sure 'nough, what would
you do If you saw God coming? Not in
the catechism now. S'pose he was
coming right through the door there?"
The boy did- not hesitate. "I'd run."
he said.
And the father, who choked Just then
over his paper, got no sympathy from
the mother, but only the indignant re
mark:
"Your children make me ashamed." â

World's Greatest Cotton Center.
While large numbers of English mer
chants are visiting Â»he Louisiana Pur
chase Exhibition, many American busi
ness men engaged in the manufactur
ing dry goods trade are making trans-
Atlantic voyages expressly to attend
the exhibition recentl;- opened at Brad
ford, England.
That market holds the record as the
greatest wool center in the world Al
though the Bradford exhibition is com
paratively limited in scope, being
mainly devoted to textile industries, so
diversified are the interests connected
therewith that thousands of wholesale
as well as retail dealers figure it as the
chief attraction of a European trip this
year.
, The display of -wools comprehends
raw materials and yarns from which
such fabrics are produced. The differ
ent processes employed in manufactur
ing are shown in detail, from the time
the wool leaves the sheep until It is
made up In the form of dress goods and
then converted into model costumes

About Wild Indigos.
An attempt has been made during
the past year to collect information re
garding the wild indigos of the Madras
Presidency. It is supposed that among
these there is one at least of great
economic value, and the search has
been commenced for It. A number of
plants have already been received, but,
since their state of preservation on ar
rival has been almost uniformly bad.
little progress has been made in the
inquiry. Such indigos as the Govern
ment botanist was able to collect on
his tour have been carefully examined
and sent for checking to the superin
tendent of the royal gardens in Cal
cutta, and several interesting species
have been found among them.

o Do You Suffer From Lost Strength, Nervous Debility, Vari-
g cocele. Early Decay and Waste of Power? They are
g Quickly and Forever Cured by the Grand Product of Na-
O ture, DR. MCLAUGHLIN'S ELECTRIC BELT. With
| Free Electric Suspensory for WeakMcn
This Electric Suspensory carries the current, direct to the weak
2 parts and cures all weakness of men, varicocele, etc It develops and
Â£ expands all weak organs and checks unnatural drains. No case of
Failing Vigor, Varicocele or Debility can resist the powerful Elec-
O trie Suspensory. It never fails to cure. It is free with Belts for weak
9 men.
Â© No man should be weak; no man should suffer the loss of that
g vital element which renders life worth living. No man should allow
q himself to become less a man than nature intended him; no man
0 should suffer for sins of his youth, when there is at hand a certain
q cure for his weakness, a check to his waste of power.
O Most of the pains, most of the weakness of stomach, heart, brain
Â© and nerves, from which men suffer, are due to an early loss of na-
Â© ture's reserve power through mistakes of youth. You need not suffer
? for this. You can be restored. The very clement which you have
lost you can get back, and you may be as happy as any man that
o lives.
Â© My Electric Belt, with Special Electric Suspensory (free), will
Â© restore your power. It will check all unnatural drains and give back
Â© the old vigor of youth.

J2 DR. MCLAUGHLIN â Dear Sir: I wore thÂ« Belt procured of you ail last wtater.
V until about the middle of February, when I left It off and went to work, fcavlaf
O received complete relief from . the weakness, varicocele and rheumatism I Â«uffered to

a and. notwithstanding tho fact that I am not situated so as to ba abla to give myself
any particular attention. I am still In perfect health. Gratefully yours.
g A. J. MOORE.
5 This drain on your power causes Kidney Trouble, Rheumatism
g and Stomach Ailments. You know it is a loss of vital power and
9 .affects every organ of the body. Most of the ailments from which
O rnen suffer can be traced to it.
Â© I have cured thousands of men who have squandered the savings
â¢ of years in useless doctoring.
O My Belt is^ easy to use; put it on when you go to bed; you feel
2? the glowing heat from it (no sting or burn as in old-style belts),
q and you feel the nerves tingle with the new life flowing into them,
q You get up in the morning feeling like a two-year-old.

An, appeal was taken from the de
cision of the State Supreme Court yes
terday to the United States Supreme
Court in the case of Lee Look, a Chi
nese, who murdered a fellow country
man in San Jose five years ago during
the course 'Trf a highbinder war. The
proceeding upon which the nation's
highest "tribunal will act is a petition
for a writ of error. Lee Look has
been condemned to death three times
and twice his attorneys have secured
a new trial. Several of the wealthiest
Celestials on the coast have advanced
the large sums necessary for the de
fense.
Xee l^ook Is Still Fighting:.
These remnants are comprised of odd pieces and
odd lots of suits, ekirta, waists, jackets, silks.
dress goods, ribbons, laces, pillow-cases, sheets,
draperies, curtains, towels, bedspreads, etc.
The vale begins to-morrow morning and will
undoubtedly be one of the biggest sales that
has been conducted in San Francisco this year.*
It has always been the custom of Strauss &
Frohman to allow the bulk of their remnants
to accumulate during the season until the be
ginning of their remnant sale. This has re
sulted In thousands and thousands of rem
nants which, when properly labeled and re
duced to typical remnant prices, have created
a sensation at their sale.
Experience Is a great teacher, a teacher very
much appreciated by chrewd ehoppera.
For several years it has been the custom of
Strauss & 107 and 109 Post St., to
conduct an annual remnant Bale of great Im
portance. Year after year as these sales be
come better known the crowds become bigger,
until upon eome occasions it was even neces
sary to close the doors In order to insure pro
tection to those who had already entered and
crowded around the remnant counters during
the remnant sales.
Women of San Francisco Profit by
Experience.
THEY. HAVE LEARNED TO KNOW.
Chief "Wittman issued an order yes
terday instructing policemen to take
all Juvenile offenders to the Boys' and
Girls' Aid Society. Officers T. R.
Flinn and W. D. Scott are instructed
to see that the Juveniles arrested are
transferred to and from the Juvenile
Court by the O'Farrell-street patrol
wagon and they are held responsible
for them while in their custody.
-The action of the Board of Health
in refusing to care for Juvenile of
fenders was caused by an alleged lack
of funds. The Juvenile offenders have
heretofore been kept at the, Central
Emergency Hospital pending the dis
position of their cases.
Policemen Are Instructed In Future
to Take Them to the Boys' and
Girls' Aid Society.

BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBThe dissension is said to have oc
curred over the matter of church Im
provement. In a statement prepared by
A. C. Ralston, a deacon of the church
who has withdrawn, he says *that a
week ago the trustees made a report in
regard to contemplated improvements.
Over this meeting the pastor presided,
and "when he heard .the report of the
trustees, upon which they were a unit,
he showed his disapproval by censuring
the entire board and then leaving the
meeting. After he left his suggestions
were disregarded and^the report adopt
ed as submitted.
There was an outward lull following
the speaking of the pastor's mind at
the business meeting, but the caldron
was still boiling. TWe next Wednesday
evening prayer meeting was turned
Into a bedlam, by an announcement
credited to Mr. 'Slaughter in which he
said that there were members ' then
present with whom he would not as
sociate. He asked them to withdraw.
Following this applications were pre
sented from many members for letters
of withdrawal. The insurgents are
now trying to gain a sufficient lead to
oust the pastor from the pulpit.

Mad Ox mine, 4 near Whiskytown, will
be largely developed.
The Los Angeles Mining Review an
nounces that the Salt Lake road has
caused a great revival of mining in
the Searchlight district and in the des
erts generally along the route of the
road. ItWontinues:
Many mines that were abandoned twenty or
more years ago. by Mormons and others, when
silver went down, will bÂ« reopened and suc
cessfully worked, as the cost of operation will
be greatly reduced by cheaper transportation.
Prospects which have lain dormant since they
were discovered will be developed Into mines,
and new strikes made, aft on account of easier
accessibility.
For over a year business has been rather
poor in the Searchlight district, partly #a ac
count of a strike declared against the Search
light mining companies over some trivial mat
ter. The larger companies have, however,
kept steadily at work. The etrikÂ« has bÂ«en
declared off. From now on thÂ« Searchlight
district should rapidly improve.
" NEVADA COUNTY DEAL.
A deal is reported to be pending for
the combination , in one ownership of
several mines on the Kentucky Ridge,
In Nevada County, and fronting on
Deer Creek. The mines included are
the Reynolds. Niagara, Snyder, Ken
tucky Ridge and Hudson mines. Let
son Balllet has been back of the
scheme to unite the properties and use
water flowing through the district to
produce sufficient electricity for the
stamps and other machinery on the
ridge. The announcement is made that
Balliet has nothing to do with the
present enterprise.
The Blue \ Gravel, Deer Creek and
Mooney Flat Hydraulic Mining Com
pany is reported to be about to work
gravel deposits that have been secured
on the Yuba River in the Smartsville
section. The mining lands extend from
the Mooney Flat to the Yuba River, a
distance of two and a half miles, and
include the mineral rights of the Ex
celsior Water Company. The company
will run a tunnel from Mooney Flat to
the Smartsville mining claims.
The American Mining Congress will
convene In Portland on August 22. Ir
ving Mahon gives out the information
that reports from twenty-five States
regarding their geology and mineral
resources will be submitted to the con
vention. Legislation will be proposed
for the consideration of Congress. In
a general way\ Mahon makes a very
good argument in favor of the creation
of a bureau of mines in connection
with the national Government. Some
of his statements are as follows:
The mining industry embraces .not merely
mining for the precious metals and for Iron
and coal* but it also Includes the production
of oil and stone quarrying in all Its various
forms. It covers the entire Union, for therÂ»
Is not * single State In which mining in some
form is not conducted. It represents the In
terest, the welfare* and the hopes of millions
of men and women. Seeond only to agricul
ture, mining is the cornerstone of the nation's
prosperity and wealth. Through the produc
tion of Its Iron and coal mines the United
States has become the chief manufacturer of
steel and steel products In the world and Its
supremacy In foreign . markets would never
have been achieved had it not been for tha
wealth -which nature stored In the mines
whether! of coal. Iron, copper, lead sliver or
gold. -,%. . r fir
Â¦ To refus* i;lo 'establish a Department of Mines
snd Mining, when already we have one of
War. of. the Navy, of Foreign Affairs, of Com
merce and Labor and of Agriculture is to
neglect an industry which Is more to this
country than -the maintenance of either the
army or the navy, for without It we should
be dependent tn both those branches of public
service upon foreign countries. It is more to
us than our diplomatic . relations and yields
first place only to the cultivation of the soil.

ELECTRICITY SUPPLA>TTXG
STEAM IN* EXGLAXD
Rather Slowly.
Following the American Methods In
Train and Equipment, but
Another English railway has changed
its motive power. It was formerly op
erated by steam. Now it is nfn by elec
tricity. The line stretches northward
from Liverpool to Southport. a dis
tance of something like eighteen or
twenty miles. Active steps for equip
ping It with the third rail system began
almost exactly a year ago, and the
conversion was virtually completed be
fore the close of 1903. Service was not
initiated, however, until a few days
ago. Trains are made up like those on
the Manhattan elevated road, partly of
motor cars and partly of trailers,
though only two of each kind are re
quired at present. When a train reaches
either end of the line no switching is
necessary to bring the engine to the
head. It is only necessary for the mo
torman to walk to the other end. move
two or three electric switches and
.everything Is ready for a return trip.
Two "marked improvements have re
sulted from the change. The same thins
was noticed in New York when elec
tricity replaced steam on the elevated
roads, but not to the same extent.
Formerly there were seventy-four
trains a day each way on the division
reaching to Halls road, which is" only
seven and a quarter miles from Liver
pool, and thirty-six went on to South
port. The number does not look large,
but it taxed the facilities of the com
pany to the limit, and that Is why thÂ«
change was made. Now 119 trains run
to Halls road, and sixty-five of them
continue to Southport. In other words,
the capacity of the line has been mul
tiplied about 70 per, cent. The other
gain is in speed. Trains that stopped
at all stations formerly needed flfty-
I four minutes to make the run from end
to end. Now they do it In thirty-seven
minutes. With a solitary exception tha
expresses took thirty minutes, and now
they do It in seventeen. Formerly there
were only two or three expresses each
way daily, and now they run hourly.
The first English company .operating
a steam road outside of London to
make even a limited use of electricity
was the Northeastern. The old motive
power is still retained for most of tha
system, but a, large suburban service
in the .vicinity of Newcastle-on-Tyne
is now conducted by electricity over a
section of track laid years ago. The
Liverpool and Southport is really a lo
cal line, hence the conversion Is com
plete instead* of partial. In some ways,
however, the action of the Northeast
ern company is the more significant.
Pioneer enterprises demand greater sa
gacity and courage than imitations.â

In trying to jump a freight train near
Emeryville this afternoon John Wil
son of Keswick fell under the 'care and
both his legs were taken off. He is
but 22 years of age, and was trying to
"beat" his way back to Keswick when
the accident occurred. He says he
has an uncle, Alfred Olsen, 1768 Cates
crow avenue, Chicago. He was removed
to the Receiving Hospital, where' the
wounds were dressed.
Wilson had successfully boarded a
freight commonly known as "The Can
nonball" at the Sixteenth-street depot
and had gone as far as Emeryville,
when he discovered that the freight
was only a local and tumped off. Either
he wanted to catch another freight that
was passing or did not see it comins
and was knocked doivn. The left leg
was taken off at the knee and the right
between the knee and ankle. He is a
strong, big fellow, and the doctors see
no reason why he should succumb. He
apparently received no other injuries,
and retained his consciousness until
given the anesthetic at the hospital.

:'; According to the Chronicle-Union,
Mono County has good prospects in the
Masonic mining district. Dr. Krebs has
located six claims. H. McCluakey says
â¢ According to the Grass Valley Union
the plant of the Idaho-Maryland prop
erty will be largely Increased. The cost
of putting the old mine in* running or
der has been estimated from 5100,000 to
$260,000. Bray Williams will reopen the
mine. The bond on the property is for
more than $1,000,000, according to' the
same authority. The milling capacity
will be increased" to 260 tons a day and
a large cyanide plant will be installed.
â¢ gome of the vicissitudes of mining in
the deserts of Southern California, says
the Los Angeles Herald, are brought
into notice by the action of the San
Bernardino County Supervisors, who
have Jusf abolished four voting dis
tricts In the mining district east of the
mountain range. The Herald says:
One of the districts had its nucleus at Calico,
which was a thriving town a few years ago,
with a population of from 1200 to 1.100. But
now no more do they sweep up a basketful
of cards In the streets of Calico every morn*
ing; the lizards run riot: up and down th>
deserted straets and over the rusty â¢ mining
machinery. It Is all very pathetic, but It Ja the
common history of mining 'townsâ a thriving
camp or an embyro i city of one year may be
a*, silent and deserted as a graveyard the next
yrar But there Is stllU plenty of silver out
there on the desert. The business of mining
it was suspended simply because It ceased to be
profitable when the price of sliver reached bot
tom figures. Mining on the desert is excep
tionally costly and the market value . of the
output controls operations. > When silver prlc*s
were high the mines were worked profitably,
as they will be again some day. Southern
California is rich In mineral resources of many
kinds. Including gold. Ample capital and the
latest appliances for mining are altke needed
to stir activity in this line In many localities.
IN VARIOUS DISTRICTS.
Nevada County Is much pleased be
cause the '.Idaho-Maryland'- rnlne" is
about to resume operations. The Grass
Valley Tidings sees great things in
store. Editorially it says:
What the resumption of woTk in the Mary
land means to this community it l*not neces
sary to explain to the people of Grass Valley.
The news is definite. Work is to begin at an
early date and there Is nothing to stand In the
way of a restoration of the old times to Grass
Valley. Business will pick up and all the
community wlU feel the Impulse of progress.
The fortunes that still lie burled unHer the
earth are. In the firm belief of mining ex
perts who have studied the conditions of thiJ
district, as enormous as those that have been
taken out. When we recollect the years and
yters that the old Idaho was a regular producer
and the success that attended the workings of
that property, the fortunes made from It, and
when vre know from successful mining experts
of world-wide teputation and proved ability
that the mlnea have not been worked out, but
that' their producing days are still unnumbered,
we cannot but' fefl that Charles E. Clinch
spoke* with the spirit of true prophecy when,
at the banquet given In his honor as he start
ed for the Kast, he said that when the mines
of South Africa had been exhausted and the
fields of Mexico abandoned, Nevada County
would still be the home of the richest minen
In' the world and they would .still be producing.
Concerning the gold dredging indus
try, which one clearly sees will be ex
tended, the following detailed Informa
tion comes in opportuntely in descrip
tion of the great machine that was
built >at "West Seattle to be used to
dredge for gold in Alaska:
It is a combination suction-bucket gold
dredger and was built for'the Bachmaa Djedf
lng Company of Pasadena, Cal. It is entirely
a new apparatus In the field of hydraulic ma
chinery. In Alaska It has proved to be an Im
possibility to secure all the gold with the
Australian or* endless chain backeta. The
disturbance caused by the buckets r digging
and stirring up the sand and fine gold results.
In a great loss of the minute particles car->
ried away by the action of the water. It is
claimed for the dredger that It solves. the
problem and brings to the surface every par
ticle of granular matter -coming within reach
of Its Auction pipe, and all pockets or cavities
hclding the precious metal are emptied quickly.
The sand and gravel are removed by the
buckets without any Injury to the plungers,
and the owners claim that this dredge ts a
saving of S0O horsepower over the centrifugal
pump, and Is a combination of the centrifugal
pump and the endless chain system. At any
time a hydraulic giant can bÂ« attached to
the discharge pipe for sluicing purposes and
requires only six horsepower, with a velocity
at the nozzle of 160 feet per second.
With the power of such a machine
mountains could be torn away, declare the
Inventors. The pKingers of this dredge travel
at a rate of 2C0 feet per second, giving a
velocity to the. water in the suction pipe of
seventeen feet per second, carrying all the
irravel gold or nuggets In suspension. Tne
pump 'is located as close to the water as is
practicable when operating to use all the
atmospheric pressure. j
The dredger Is not heavy and cumbersome
looking, only weighing thirty tons. It cost
$10 000 and is the first dredger put to a
practical use for granular matter. The men
who own the dredger are business men of
Seattle and are interested In the Hudfon
Lumber Company./ They have valuable mining

River Alaska, where the dredger Is on the
way in tow of the tug Irene.

glorious time, so they say, and echoes
from the now deserted little clubhouse
certainly bear out their assertion.
A bountiful Dutch spread tempted
even the man of little appetite, and for
the reveler with a thirst there was
plenty wherewith to quench -it To be
well wined and dined and to commune
In good fellowship with ferilliant intel
lects at their best â what more could
one desire? What wonder that time
passed unheeded!
George de Golia, prince of good fel
lows always, was an ideal host, and R.
M. Fitzgeraldâ Robert of the silver
tongue and ready witâ acted as toast
master. Other shining lights in this
goodly gathering were William Pierce
Johnson, George Greenwood, H. J.
Knowles, Charles P. Hubbard, J. | H.
Ames. J. O. Cad man, C. B. Gould,
George S. Wheaton and Dr. A. M. Car

The long legged bird who is flap
ping his wings over this part of the
country Just now is evidently partial
to girls. Little daughters have ar
rived in several homes recently and
they are til certainly fine endugh to
do credit to the stork's good- taste. Of
the recent newly made parents of
girls, the Parcells were the first to" re
joice. Then Irving Burrell and his
wife â formerly winsome Isabelle Ken
na â were made happy by the advent
of a diminutive Isabelle. Now conies
the news from Sacramento that the
Dan Beldens have a daughter, and
last night the stork left a little girl
at the Piedmont home of the Will
Hushes. Mrs. ' Hush was formerly
Miss Julia Talbot, a dashing and ac
complished San Francisco girl, and
her romantic marriage with hand
some Will Hush a year or so ago cre
ated quite a sensation. The little lady
who arrived last night has her proud
father's dark" eyes and hair.
Mrs. John Connors entertained a
box party at Ye Liberty to-day, . b^er
guests being Miss Anita Thomson,
Miss Loretta Hanley, Miss Pansy Per
kins. Miss Sanborn and. Mrs. George
E. Perkins. Mrs. Perkins' three chil
dren entertained some little friends
from the city in adjoining seats.

THE SAN FRANCISCO GALLi SUNDAY; ; JULY 10,- 1904.
IlEV. MAD1SO.V SLAUGHTER OP
OAKLAND. WHOSE CONGREGA
TION IS RENT BY DISSENSIONS.
The Standard Oil Company, in 1903
supplied 84 per cent of the domestic
demand for kerosene and 90 per cent
of the export demand. Its net profits
for the year exceeded $60,000,000.
In reply to the accusations made
against him the Rev. N Mr. Slaughter
declares that the entire trouble has
been caused bv a few disgruntled mem
bers. "I called a meeting some time
ago," he said, "to find out what the
feeling was toward me, and out of a
total of seventy-two members who at
tended the meeting fifty-eight voted on
a secret ballot for me to stay, while
only fourteen voted against me.
Eighteen members who did not attend
the meeting have since sent me word
that while they were not able to be
present they would have voted to re
tain me. With seventy-six . members
out of a total of about ninety resident
members, I feel that my work here is
no^ done." :-Â¦{'Â¦.â¢,.";'' 'Â¦*'*-=
An attempt was made a few nights
ago to entice the dove of peace once
again to spread its wings over the dis
turbed congregation. To this end a spe
cial meeting was called at the residence
of a member. Exhortations were
spoken, confessions made and apologies
accepted. A woman called for the tak
ing of hands and the singing of "Blest
Be the Tie That Binds." Seemingly the
ruffled spirits were to become calm. But
the gdod work was spoiled by a mem
ber refusing to join in the* ceremony
unless the charge was withdrawn that
Slaughter had said he would spend his
last $100 to break up the church unless
he had his way.
"I did not say it," announced the pas
tor. /
"Yes you did," called out Mr. Green,
superintendent of the Sunday-school.
"You said it In the presence of myself
and my little boy."
"You did say it," retorted Deacon
Gilbert.
The song was not sung,; and the meet-
Ing adjourned with. the wounds gaping
more widely than ever. And the end is
not yet. Â¦--;;. ; ;

CHICAGO, July Â».â Easier Liverpool cables
and proepects of better weather In the South
west caused much liquidation of wheat at the
opening According to the weather map there
had been no additional rains during the night
In Kansas. This fact brought out quite lib

bear side. The market continued weak the re

Improved weather conditions had an equally
depressing effect on the corn market. The

BARLEY â The week closed on a quiet and
unchanged market, as far as the cash grain
was concerned. Futures were rather higher,
the market being advanced by the covering of
shorts, while business In the December option
was brisk.
CASH BARLEY.
WHEAT â The foreign markets showed no
particular change, though Paris futures were
higher.
Fluctuations at Chicago were not as sharp
as during the past several days. The Interest
of the day centered in the weather reports, es
pecially those from Kansas, which were
gloomy. Kansas City wired that the worst
was probably over. The yield would probably
be reduced 20,000,000 bushels, but lt was still
too early for a definite estimate of the damage
Estimates of damage In the Southwest, even
by conservative people, are away up in the
large figures.
In this market futures were somewhat low
er, but the cash grain was firm, with the
market almost bare of offerings. The millers
and shippers are both out of the market and
the . only demand Is from feeders.

', The market was heavily supplied with de
ciduous fruits and, although trade was active,
both for local use and shipping account, prices
of most descriptions ranged lower. Peaches
wero the most plentiful and weakest descrip
tion, there being over 8000 boxes on the mar
ket. The Hale's Early variety, which con
stituted the bulk of the receipts, were very
weak at 3O3x4Oc per box. and backet offerings
of the same variety went begging at nominal
rates. Yellow kinds, such as St. John and
Triumph, were scarce and sold at 5O@65c per
box. Apricots In crates were scarce and firm
at Â£5@90c per crate, while bulk stock was
quiet, although receipts were light. The can
ners were Indifferent buyers and were only
picking up -bargains. Plums and Prunes of
good quality were wanted for shipment, but
supplies were too heavy to permit any ad
vance In prices. Large boxes of Figs from the
river were In light receipt and firm, but or
dinary packages were plentiful and continued
weak. Good Apples were In demand and
brought higher prices. 4- tier packages being
wanted for. export. Fontainebleau Grapes ap
peared from Vacavllle. One crate came In and
found a buyer at $1 50. Berries ruled weak,
with the canners still buying the surplus at

COFFEE â C. E. Blckford's circular gives
the receipts at this port thus far this year at
155.3C5 bags, against 205.755 bags during the
same time In 1903. The sales from first hands
were 119.750 bags, against 136,775. The stock
in first hands July 1 was 55,553 bags, against
94,037. The world's visible supply July 1 was
12.361.26a bags, against 11.90O,173Â« July 1, 1003.
The circular says:
"Depleted stocks in second hands and a har
dening tendency of the guiding- markets re
sulted In an unusually good business during-
June, deliveries from first hands being 30.560
bags, all kinds, against 16,313 for the pre
ceding month. As has been the case for
some months past the call seems limited to
coffees worth not over lie, higher qualities
being taken sparingly and only when either
of more than average merit or when obtain
able at marked concessions from customary
asking prices. Grades from 6c to 9c are con
stantly In requisition and the arrivals of these
have not been more than fairly sufficient to
meet the current demand. Such coffees are
consequently very firmly held, while the re
verse is to be said of the top descriptions and
quotations for the latter are easier.
"Since the middle of June numerous cables
from Brazil have reported inclement weather
In that country â heavy rains In some sections,
severe frosts in others â the majority advising
some to considerable damage to the fruit or
at least foreshadowing lower estimates of the
crop now coming In. No f all authorities agre*
in this, several holding that the season Is not
sufficiently advanced to confirm the assertions
and that the weather conditions described are
not apt to prove Â¦ injurious at this early period
further than to probably delay gathering. The
Immediate -effect, however, has been a rise in
prices In New York of v ' ic and a deeper
interest in the speculative position and the
actual article.

Lower, price* ruled for new Potatoes and the
market, closed weak, with quite a heavy sur
plus unsold. Receipts were over 5000 sacks
and the ! carry-over from the preceding day
was unusually heavy. As previously men
tioned, the new crop in the State of Washing
ton is being marketed and there is no more
demand from that quarter. The weakness In
this market is due largely to the withdrawal
of these northern orders. Red Onions con
tinued to strengthen under steadily decreasing
receipts, while Yellow were quiet, with sup
plies, ample. '
Trade In miscellaneous vegetables was active
under the usual extra demand for Sunday, but
supplies of most descriptions were heavy, and,
despite the increased trading, the market had
a weak tone. Fine Green Corn in crates did
better and Peas continued scarce and firm,
but all other fresh . varieties were quoted
lower.-, The top quotation for Tomatoes in
small packages was obtained only for the Mis.

they have only 21,000 paupers, while

The Los Angeles people have arrived
at their present estimate-of the popu
lation of the City of the Angels by
means of a new city directory. This
furnishes an unofficial census of the
city, and it Is alleged that the returns
are more accurate than are those sub
mitted by the men employed as census
takers for the United States, because
the Government method of paying for
the census taking is not as advantage
ous to the enumerators as is that of the
directory proprietors, the latter employ-
Ing by the day, so that there is no
temptation to shirk work. The Los An

The Fresno Superintendent of Edu
cation has submitted school figures
that indicate the progress of Fresno.
The Fresno Democrat reviews the fig
ures and draws therefrom the conclu
sion that in seven years the population
of Fresno has doubled. The city en
rollment of school children is 3643. The
average daily attendance at the schools
is 2705. The Democrat reasons as fol
lows:
The general statistics for thÂ« past seven
years are interesting from the fact that they
indicate what a remarkable growth la popu
lation Fresno has achieved during that period.
These show that the number of
census children between the ages of 5 and 17
years has increased from 1051 to 4117. or more
than doubled. The total number of pupils en
rolled in the schools has increased from 2103
to 3CS3. or nearly twice as many. The num
ber of teachers employed has gona up from
forty-five to eighty-seven, the total expendi
tures from fS0.120 to $73,190 only. The
average coat per pupil based en the total en
rollment in 1VJ7, \fM $37 31. in 1904 $65 IS.

The Napa Register, giving an ac
count of the enumeration by the letter
carriers, says that it has been evident
to every house owner and business
man in Napa that the city has forged
ahead remarkably during the last two
years, but no one was prepared for the
percentage of gain that has been
shown. In numbering the people \Â«>f
Napa no one just outside of the city
limits, south of Pine street, in the Orn
duff tract, or in North Napa, was
counted. If these were included, so
says the Register, Napa has a popula
tion of 6000. At her present rate of
growth she will soon reach the 10,000
mark.
,'; ' ADVANCE OP FRESNO.
Several California cities have recent
ly adduced testimony to show to what
extent their population is increasing.
Among the number are Fresno, Napa
and Los Angeles. The postmaster of
Xapa caused the letter carriers In
Napa to enumerate the people of that
city. The result is the conclusion that
Napa has' grown nearly forty per cent
in four years, or since the United
States census of 1900. At the last Fed
eral census Napa was shown to have
a population of but 4036, a loss of 259
as compared with the figures of the
census of 1890. There has been much
local dissatisfaction concerning the
manner in which the counting of the
population of Napa was performed in
1D00. A great many inhabitants were
overlooked, so claim the Napa papers,
and there were similar errors in 1S90.
The count of the letter carriers Â«n
Napa, which has just been completed,
gives Napa a population of 5643. If
the figures of 1900 were correct then
there has been a growth of 40 per cent
since they were made. In the latest
count there are 130 Chinese only to be
enumerated. Their number has de
creased and fewar Mongolians are em
ployed in the different industries and
homes of Napa than there were a few
year3 ago.

avoiding, however, the few places In these val

that It has three great Knes of demand: First,

Among other matters mentioned by
the Benicia Board of Trade relating to
Benicia are the following:
Private wharves for larsre factories can be
economically constructed. Their cost of main
tenance is very slight, as the teredo worm is'
unable to live in the harbor of Benicia and de>
etroy the piling, on account of the fact that the
water is largely fresh water from the rivers.
Piling driven over thirty-seven years ago
stands perfectly sound to-day.
The development of electricity by water
power In Northern California has done a great
work for the State in furnishing cheap power.
Benicia enjoys the advantage of being on the
line of one of the largest power companies In
the world, and its factories are largely run, by
electric power. Fuel oil and coal can also be
laid down at Benicia at the lowest possible
cost. v^Â»~
Plenty of desirable land can be had on which
to build homes clcso to the factory sites. Be
nicia has a fine accredited high school, gram
mar and private schools; churches of several
denominations; electric lighting for homes and
highways; in fact, every convenience that goes
to make a community desirable to live In and
bring up families.
San Francisco is the labor market of the Pa
cific Coast and Benicia enjoys the advantage
eX belns able to secure labor at the shortest
This strons collection of facts, con
cisely worded, is supplemented by oth
ers that are well calculated to show
to inquirers the advisability of becom
ing acquainted with Benicia. Among
the additional statements some are se
lected:
"Benicia already has the largest
modern tannery on the Pacific Coast
and two other tanneries, a very ex
tensive factory w r here agricultural im
plements are manufactured and wide
ly distributed, a fruit and fish cannery
of large proportions and a creamery
where evaporated cream, condensed
milk and butter are manufactured in
large quantities. The United States
Government has a large arsenal and
barracks located here. Benicia also
has two ship yards that are turning
out hundreds of vessels. Thus it will
be seen that Benicia has demonstrated
its claim to consideration as a man
ufacturing locality by having so many
successful institutions already In op
eration."
Also it is stated that the steamboat
lines from San Francisco will land
goods at the private warehouses of
any factory. Railroad lines can also
be run from the main line to any fac
tory. "Therefore every possible econ
omy in the handling of freight is ef
fected, which is one of the most im
portant items of consideration in lo
cating a factory. Steam schooners,
bringing supplies from the various
points along the coast of California,
will deliver their cargoes at Benicia at
the same rates of freight thar they
charge San Francisco. For two miles
there is a level stretch of, land lying
between deep water and the railroad,
furnishing the most advantageous
sites that it is possible to secure from
a standpoint of receiving raw mater
ials and of shipping the finished prod
ucts."
HOST OF ATTRACTIONS.
The Board of Trade of Benicia has
prepared a statement of the advan
tages that Benicia possesses, especially
as a manufacturing site. At the same
time an invitation is extended by the
board to all inquirers who are looking
for eligible places for manufacturing
uses to communicate, and the promise
Is made that all needed information
will be promptly and accurately given.
Considering that the claim is made that
"Benicia Is the logical manufacturing
site of the Pacific Coast," much is nat
urally expected to be set forth In JustU
lication.
At the outset it is said by the board
in an authorized statement that Beqi
cla enjoy3 the most favorable shipping
facilities possible. '"The deepest ocean
vessels can land at Benicia. Three
steamboat lines make daily trips be
tween Benicia and San Francisco, and
many railroad trains pass through Be
nicia daily on their way to and from
San Francisco. Thirty miles from San
Francisco by rail and twenty-eight by
steamboat, it is situated on deep water
and on the line of Eastern railroad
traffic. Benicia is a terminal point,
and its factories are therefore enabled
to secure the lowest possible rates on
raw materials coming from the East.
On materials coming from San Fran
cisco the steamboat lines and the rail
roads charge a very low rate."

I A remarkable story of how finger
I prints led to the arrest of a burglar
was told at the Hanley Police Court.
j During the Christmas holidays the
premises of Councilor Bickley, jeweler
of Hanley. were broken into, and jew
elry to the ,value of Â£50 stolen. The
only clew was the linger prints found
on a plate glass shelf in the shop.
i These were photographed and then
! sent by the chief constable to Scotland
: Yard. Shortly after a reply was re
i ceived from London, saying that the
â¢ finger prints were those of a man
! named Davies, and were taken at
. Wakefield. A John Davies was known
i to be in Hanley, so he was arrested
! and charged. At first he denied the
; charge, but on being put in the cells
[ he called Detective Inspector Higgins
j and said, "You've copped me fair. I
\ did the job. You will find the Jewelry
i in the tank in Bath street, tied in a
handkerchief." Detective Inspector
Higrgins went to the spot indicated and
there found the Jewelry.
Davies, who is a collier, aged, 25, was

ANACONDA, Mont., July 9.â What Is
believed to.be a mysterious case of at
tempted murder has been revealed by
the : issuance of a warrant by Justice
Murphy for the arrest of Mrs. A. Fer
guson, whose home is- near Stuart, a
small station four miles from here.
From a complaint sworn to by George
Parrott it appears that the woman at

Great Falls that she would compel
Parrott to dig his own grave, kill him
and then bury v him in the hole.
Parrott swears that the woman lured
him to a lonely spot about three miles

him, and that but for a lucky glance
upward when he felt the 'muzzle of a
revolver touching his neck he would
have been killed.
. The absence of any known motive on
the part of Mrs. Ferguson makes the
affair a very peculiar one. Parrott says
that when Mrs. Ferguson drew a dia
gram of the excavation he was to make
to reach the treasure chest of the rob

a grave struck him as odd, and when
after digging about four feet he noticed
that the ground had never been dis

Five years ago George Parrott's
brother was strangled to death In a re

Ferguson, who was suspected of the
crime, disappeared after the murder,

In the maneuvers contemplated-
Major General Dickinson is charged
vlth the duty of moving the State
troops, to begin August 13. A schedule
cf time for departure of the troops for
the camp grounds was prepared, but
en examination of the same shows
that it would require a number of the
commands to reach San Francisco a
day ahead of the time fixed for de
parture. This would entail consider
able expense to feed and house the
men, who would have to wait for the
trains.
General Dickinson has sent a letter
cf Inquiry to the railroad company
asking for specific time to enable him
to order the troops to move, so as to
make close connection with trains
bound in the direction of the camp
grounds.
Two large commercial bodies have
been asked to take action in the mat
ter of having members of such bodies
grant a leave of absence to their em
playes who are members of the guard
to enable them to go to camp. Many
favorable replies have been received
at division headquarters.
At this encampment there will be
no officer higher than colonel In
charge of the State troops. The na
tional guardsmen will be formed into
two brigades, each in command of a
United States officer. They will have
to follow the routine laid down for
the regulars; they will have to par
take of army rations to be prepared
by the cook of each company, and
there will be no social features. In
etead of being a picnic, as many of
the State camps have been, this is to
be an outing for Instruction, accord
ing to United States army regulations.
Much of the success, so far as the
guardsmen are concerned, will depend
upon the spirit with which the men
enter upon the work.
All branches of the National Guard
of the State are at this time occupied
â¢with preparatory work for the en
campment with the United States
troops in San Luis Obispo, commenc
ing August 13.
General MacArthur, U. S. A., has
issued a long order concerning th*.
encampment, which has been incor
porated in an order Issued from head
quarters at Sacramento. In this the
privates, musicians, non-commission
ed officers and officers who are to take
part in the encampment are directed
to note certain paragraphs referring
to duties they will have to perform.

and go through the maneuvers so
