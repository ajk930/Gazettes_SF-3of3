Officials Postponed.
NEW YORK, Dec 6. â Tiye expected did not occur to-night in the
Cbadu-ick case, and all the predictions , proved at fault when at a late
hour it was announced that no conference between Federal officers and
Andrew Carnegie had been held at the latter'* home. This turn was
mrpr&ns, for Carnegie had announced in the course of the day that
he would be clad to receive a Federal officer, and it was supposed that
F. F. Oldham, representing the Comptroller of the Currency, would
meet him to-nicbt and that the question of the notes alleged to have
been given to Ira Reynolds of Cleveland and said to bear the name of
Andrervt Carnegie would be discussed. > As unexpected as the news that
no conlerence was held was the departure of Sirs. Chadwick from the
Holland House, where 6he resided, for the ..New' Amsterdam 'Hotel. She
was accompanied by her son and a maid and took with her. some bag
gage. Secret Service men who have been at the Holland House for sev
eral dafrs followed Mrs. Chadwick. . .- ,._â¢..
NETS' : YORK, Dec. 6. â Andrew
Squire,' aj Cleveland attorney, repre
senting Ira Reynolds, made the an
nouncement to-night, after several
conferences with Receiver Lyon, | Old
fcam andiothers, that he believed there
â would be no further developments in
the Chadwick case before to-morrow.
He said .that Oldham had returned to
Washington. This announcement was
the fire: indication that there would
jiot be a meeting at Carnegie's home
to-night.
Stories of a possible arrest in the
c:'^e were still current this evening,
but so .far as known no warrant has
yet been issued. It is said that Mrs.
Chadwick's arrest will Immediately
follow Carnegie's statement that the
notes bearing his signature are forg
eries.
Lawyer Carpenter, one of Mrs.
Chadwick's counsel in New York, de
clined to give the results of the num
ercus conferences to-day. Percy W.
Carver, counsel for Herbert D. New
ten, iri an interview said that the
Newton claim had not been paid, and
that np new assurances had been giv
en as lo its payment, and George .W.
Kyall, associated with Carver, gave no
new information besides confirming the

\vjth Mrs. Chadwick to-day.
It v.as about 10 o'clock to-night
v.-hen Mrs. Chadvrick, -with her son
and maid left an elevator in the Hol
land House and took a cab. She
Vf&Xked slowly and her actions Indi
cated that 6he has not fully recovered.
As soon as Mrs. Chadwick's cab left
the hotel secret service men took oth
er vehicles and drove after her.
At the New Amsterdam Hotel she
was helped into the women's reception
room, where she fainted. After some
five minutes the woman was able to
walk apain, and. clinging to her son,
Fhe went to the elevator and was
shown to a room on the first floor. She
did not register, nor did her son or
the maid.
WOMAN'S ILLNESS IS SERIOUS.
The son and maid carried Mrs.
Chadwick's baggage. The son returned
to the reception room for the baggage
after he had taken his mother to her
room and the secret service men held
him in conversation for some minutes
and th'n let him go. He went back to
his mother. "" .
Shorliy before midnight Mrs.
Chadwick's son went to the public
telephone and called up Dr. Albertus
A. Moore. He asked the physician to
hurry at once to his mother, who, he
Bald, was very 11L Dr. Moore said
later: :â  .' - -
"Mrs. Chadwick is suffering from
nervous prostration, the result of her
removal from the Holland House to
this hotel and being: -followed by se
cret service men and reporters."
One of the hotel clerks said the son
had told him his mother was in a
critical condition. The coach used
by Mrs. Chadwick. her son and the
niaid was driven to Gramercy Park
after leaving: the, party.
ADDS XEW PHASE TO CASE.
The startling admission by Presi
dent Beckwith of the Citizens' Nation
al Bank of Oberlin, Ohio, that he and
Cashier Spear of that bank indorsed
Mrs. Cassie I* Chadwlck's notes to the
amount of $1,250,000 and that the
notes bore what purported to be the
signature of Andrew Carnegie has as
tounded the New York lawyers repre
senting the various interests involved
In a case which becomes more sur
prising with every new revelation.
That President Beckwith's statement
brings to light new and important
phases of the case and brings much
nearer the Inevitable uncovering of
the entire affair is the belief of a ma
jority of the attorneys interested.
Attorney Carver of counsel for Her
bert D. Newton said early to-day that
if President Beckwlth believed that
the Newton loan to Mrs. Cassie L.
Chadwick was based on the so-called
missing $500,000 note he was mis
taken.
"When Newton -loaned the money,"
the attorney said, "he had no security,
whatever except her personal note.
The money was loaned in small
nmounts, until finally new notes were
{riven to cover the total amount
loaned. Newton was shown a note for
$500,000. but I decline to say whose
name apepared on it. He also, was
shown the certificate signed by Ira
Reynolds, to the effect that he had
J 5,000,000 worth of securities belong
inr fÂ» Mr?. Chartwfek. . -.
"When I was brought into the case
the first thing I did after a long con- '
ference in New York with Mrs. Chad- !
wick, was to obtain an assignment of
the securities supposed. to be held by
Reynolds. Further developments de
pend on whether Reynolds actually
holds securities to the amount he cer
tified."
PROOF OF FORGERY LACKING.
A gentleman Intimately connected
â¢with the Chadwick cace was asked to

York with Mrs. Chadivick'E securities.
He said that it was for the purpose of j
raising money; so." that a settlement}
might be effected without further legal I

complication!. As to stories of possi
ble arrests, he said:
"So far, no complainant has ap
peared. If the notes said. to bear the
name of a well-known man are forger
ies they must be so declared, and until
he has seen them nothing can be
done." -.*." ; . - . :
The gentleman was asked If Borne of
ficial of the Oberlln Bank could not be
the complainant. The answer was re
turned: 7Â»-- -,-. v â¦-..Â».
"It must be first shown that the bank
has been Bwindled, and until this fact
can be learned matters must move with
exceeding â  caution."
.From present indications every ef
fort will be n^ade by Mrs. Chadwick's
friends .to-morrow to settle the case.
It was said to-night by one Interested
in her affairs that Mrs. Chadwick has
at the present time much more than
enough to, settle those claims which
have been made up to this time.
Andrew Carnegie said to-d&y that he
had nothing to add to his previous de
nials of the signatures of the notes at
tributed to him.

BECKWITH BREAKS DOWN.
OBERLIN. Ohio, Dec. 6.â President
C. T. Beckwlth was practically in a
state of collapse to-day as a result of
the trying ordeal through which he
passed yesterday in connection with
his hearing before the United States
commissioner in Cleveland. Beckwith
Is prostrated and his grief is pitiful-
In discussing: his troubles the voice of
the azed banker is choked with emo
ticn. He said. In speaking of the Car
negie note, that if the signatures were
forgeries then the hand of the law
should be laid upon Mrs. Chadwick.
"Why should I stand the brunt of
all this trouble, which has been direct
ly brought about by the acts of thai
woman t" he cried. Continuing Beck
with said:
"I had every reason to believe that
the notes were genuine. Indeed, Mrs.
Chad wick swore they were. She sol
emnly declared that she had seen Mr.
Carnegia write his signature on them.
To confirm this she brought an attor
ney with her, who declared that he
was the legal representative of Mr.
Carnegie and" this attorney, whose
came I cannot now state, declared that
he knew positively that the signatures
were genuine.
"It is true. that weâ Mr. Spear and
myselfâ did indorse the notes, but. of
course, we had no idea that they were
to be. put to the use that they were
afterward. Then, again, we had the
positive assurance of Ira Reynolds,
secretary of the Wade Park Bankinc
Company of Cleveland, that he had the
securities that Mrs. Chadwick claimed
he held. V ; -* -?â 
"Oh. my God!" exclaimed the old
man, "If I could only have my life to
live again for the past two years that
I might save my name from this crreat
dishonor that has befallen me."

It was unanimously determined that

Professor Christy was added to the
committee on resolutions that hia
counsel and advice might be secured
in drafting the Important paper.

words of advice to the convention,
"address a suitable memorial to the

of the Interior, to include In his in
vestigation of the storage of waters
and the reclamation of waste lands,
the foothill areas of the Sacramento
and San Joaquin Rivers, now. affected
by deposits from torrential streams,
to devise means whereby the waters
may be stored and floods prevented;
and that, second, the sediment car
ried by these torrential streams may
be diverged and deposited on the waste
lands and removed by natural means
before the waters are discharged Into
the navigable waters of the Sacramen
to and the San Joaquin;. and, further,
that the Investigation be begun at
once and prosecuted with all dispatch
consistent with thoroughness, so that
the fundamental Industries of agricul

without Injury to each other or to

This -was the key, as It was the con

marks as formally prepared, but - ha
followed them up with a messaga of
good will when he said: "I would urfa

be burled; and that we all join heart

God intended it to be, the greatest and

mind the extreme acrimony that has

V At the outset Professor Christy de
clared that the anti-debris people had

1900, he said, the population of .the
Sacramento Valley Increased once and
one- half. The population of the San
Joaquin valley Increased three and
one-sixth times, and the population of
Southern California increased ten and
one-sixth times.' In the same period
the land values in the Sacramento Val

eight times hi the San Joaquin Valley
and In the Southern California coun
ties twenty times. Then he. found
that in the thirty years included In

Designed Only to Carry
Out the Law of the Land
CAM. BUREAU. HOTEL BARTON,
"^WASHINGTON. Dec. â¬.â The first of
all the measures aimed at the appor
tioning: of Â«Â»ach State's representation
in the Houpe on the actual voting pop
ulation is the bill which Senator T. C.
Platl of New York will introduce to
morrow. Us purposes are to base each
State's representation on the male
voting population, according to the
last of^eial census. By the operation
cf such a measure, should it become a
law, it Ss estimated that sixteen dis
tricts in the South will be affected. It
Will acutely open the whole Southern
question and will arouse bitter antajf
onism in the South.
Senator Plan says that his measure
is aimed at no paiticunlar section of
the country, an-1 will affect all States
alikf. and is a just and fair, basis of
representation in Congress,
'The bill which 1 propose to intro
duce." said the New i'ork' Senator, "is
cuns?rvative in all its. details and
ought to' pass. It embodies the ideas
of the Republican Club of New York,
alihonph ii is not a partisan measure. '
Senator Plait also called attention
to thp fact that his bill will affect the
Northern States, and amons them
Massachusetts. The measure is said
to have a strong backinsr. not only of
the Republican Club of New York but
of important mem-bers of the Union
Leacrue Oub. General Henry E. Tre
main of fScvr York made his campaign
on this question during the Presiden
tial â¢ anva.'s and is interested in this
measure.
The introduction of such a measure
by Senator Piatt will cause some sur
prifÂ»- ir> and out of Congress, since it
â was nut believed any serious effort
would h*> made in the present session
to limit the Southern representation by
an act <Â«f Congress*.
ThÂ» Crumpacker resolution, provid
ing for an investigation by a seleci
committee appointed by the Speaker
Into the validity of the election laws
of the several fctates and whether the
richt tÂ«. vote is denied ai any election
for President and representatives in
C'ongTPSF ic still pending. Orumpacker
v. ill havp a conference with President
Roqaevctt this week on this question,
iird lat<?r on an effort will be made to
have the resolution brought before thÂ«
House. This, it had ' been expected,
wouM constitute the only serious at
tempt this winter at leducing the
Southern representation.
Senator Platt insists that his bill
conforms to the plank in the Republi
can national platform which favors an
investigation by Congress of this sub
ject, and, after farts are ascertained,
a reduction -of representation in the
several States, according: to the four
teenth amendment to the constitution.
The Republicans contend that in the
Southern states-, where the negro vote
is suppressed, there is a representation
iti Congress entirely out of proportion
to that in other parts of the country,
although, they also say. the national
p!ank and the bill along the lines of
that of Senator Platt does not refer to
the Southern States alone. Several
other States exclude from the elector
ate some cf their citizens by an edu
cational t*st, notably Massachusetts,
Connecticut and California.

Resolution Introduced in
Congress Calling for an
Investigation of the Line
NOW OWNED BY AMERICA
Since It Has Passed Into
Nation's Hands, Believed
All Facts Should Come Out
WASHINGTON'. Dec. 6. â Represen
tative Shackelford (D.) of Missouri,
one of the members of the House
Committee on Interstate and Foreign
Commerce, who accompanied the
Congressional party on the visit to

SCOKES "PULI/ 1 IX XAVY.
Morion Says That With Him Merit
Alone Will Count.
WASHINGTON', Dec. 6- â Merit, and
not political influence of official
prestige, should alone .determine as
signments to duty in the navy, in the
opinion of Secretary Morton. The
Secretary to-day addressed a letter to
Superintendent Brownson of the Na^
val Academy, expressing his emphatic
disapproval of the efforts to influence
the department in the assignment . of
midshipmen from the class soon to
be graduated to certain ships. The
letter reads:
The' department has been approached In
various ways.- directly and indirectly, by In
fluences seeking to control the assignment of
midshipmen, singly or in group6, from the
class about to be graduated from the Naval
Academy to certain ships- â which they or their
frtfnds have been pleased to specify. The de
partment does cot hesitate to express Its dis
approval of the spirit thus evidenced before
even the beginnlne of 8n actlvt career In the
service, which geeks to secure duty in accord
ance with individual preferences rather than
the gocd of the rervice as Interpreted By the
department's order.
The department is of the opinion that "the
young gentlemeS referred to are not fully
aware of the rravlty of the attack made by
Â§uch request* on the principle involvedâ that
the Individual exists for the good of the eerv
k-e. net the eervlce for the Individualâ and
they should be warned that the department
will regard with disfavor the bringing of any
Influence, official, political or social, seekt^^
to control or divert In their behalf Its orders
to duty.
The Secretary has repeatedly ' re
fused to Intervene in the regular as
signment of officers prepared by
Rear Admiral Converse, chief of the
Bureau of Navigation, and this, he de
clares, will continue to be his policy.
The department has the full support
of the President in its position.

conferred ihe office of Senator upon
Knox, empowering him to hold it with
all emoluments and privileges until the

State, '"If he ; shall' bo long, behave

BURTON GETS
NO WHITEWASH
Government Contends for the
Guilt an\(l I'liiiishment of
the Senator From Kansas
WITH SUPREME COURT
Use of "Influence" of This
Type" by: federal Officials
Is Strong^' Denounced
WASHINGTON, Dec. 6.â The supple
mental brief of the Government in the
case of Senator > Burton of Kansas
was filed in the Supreme Court of the
United- -States to-day. It contends
strongly for the guilt of the defendant,
although it Is admitted that the Sen
ator's course in support of the inter
ests of his client,: the Rialto Company,
was not always clear. â¢Â» Speaking of the
use of political influence In the depart
ments, the brief says that it is effec
tive, and adds:
Mr. Burton's ; traces were well covered. His
associates, on behalf of himself and his client,
niade a fair showing:, . but he held up the in
vestigation because he was a Senator, and not
merely because \ he was a general counsel of
the Rial to Company; and the portion of the
Judges' charge animadverted on at bar were
perfectly accurate and Just. If not, the most
dangerous evil In this entire situation, viz.,
that Intangible, subtle and insidious thing,
â 'Influence." can never be reached even where
the receint of compensation is plainly shown.
On the point of punishment, it Is
remarked:
Because a man of his caliber occupies a
high position and the sting of the Infamy may
thereforo be more bitter to him ,1b tio reason
for sayinz that that part of the punishment
should Increase the grade of the offense and
enlarge his protection and rights any more
than If the case put the same stigrma upon a
poor wretch who never held office and could
never expect to. - â -

Time to Complete. ;
WASHINGTON, Dec. 6.â The new-
Chinese exclusion treaty, which Secre
tary Hay and Sir Chen Tung Liang
Cheng, the Chinese Minister, are nego
tiating, presents a serious and tedious
task. When the negotiations were be
gun some time ago It was with the
hope, though hardly with the expecta
tion, that the treaty- could be signed in
time to be sent to the Senate at the
opening of Congress. If the treaty
reaches- Congress -before -the close of
the present session; the negotiators
will feel that their work progressed
rapidly.
To safeguard the country even more
adequately than does the present
treaty - against the- Immigration of
Chinese laborers of any class and to
alleviate as far as can safely be done
the alleged hardships which even the
best people of China are forced to un
dergo at the gateways of this country,
"are two results which it is hoped may
be obtained by the new, treaty. It Is

new treaty; is designed to let down the

immigration. ".:;

Continued from Pa^c 1. Column 7.
In Southern California twelve times.
Speaking further, the professor said:
â .What is the reason for the lack of progress
in the northern part of the State? Governor
Paniee, whose statistics I have quoted, attrib
utes it to lack of irrigation. Human nature is
the frame that it was 2500 years Â«go. The au
thor tWio wrote Aesop's Fables told of the. kill
ing of the goose that laid the golden egg. In
California the Anti-Debris Association killed
the goose of the golden egg.
In the period between liriS and 18S", thirty
five years. California had an average annual
gold output of $31,000,000, or $100,100 for each
working day. This came not all. but mostly,
from hydraulic mining. Marysvllleand Sacra
mento were benefited in the aays of the argo
nauts. They were two of tho business and in
tellectual centers of the State. They had gold
for their farm products. The Anti-Debris As
sociaticn killed the goose and the hydraulic
miner and the farmer â¢ were involved in the
common ruin.
MILLION'S ARE LOST.
Professor Christy called attention to
the fact that in 1885 the investment
In the hydraulic mining properties of
the State amounted to $100,000,000..
This value was destroyed. The energy
of the hydraulic miner was and is the
admiration of the. world. He con
structed mountain i - eseVvoirs and also
mountain- ditches and pipe lines that
were miles long. Now the argonauts,
old and broken, sit by their ruined
cabins and gaze &n the wrecks of their
ruined hopes. They could have had
fortune in their grasp by breaking the
knv, by running a monitor by night.
With few exceptions the hydraulic
miner has respected the law that
ruined him.
Professor Christy paid some atten
tion to the decisions by Judge Lorenzo
Sawyer and declared that they rested
on an incomplete knowledge of geo
logic laws and of the forces or na
ture. In part Professor Christy's re
marks in this regard were as follows: â 
Judge Sawyer's decisions, as strictly Inter
preted, result in a deadlock between the farm
ers and the miners. The anti -debris slogan is,
"All kinds of mining- lock alike to me!" The
growth of Northern California has been para
lyzed. The situation has taken on all the bit
terness of a religious wa.r. When anything
goes wrong In the valley It la attributed to the
hydraulic miners.
Erosion Is a natural and universal process.
There were recently great washouts on the
lines of the Southern Pacific Company and ot
the Santa Fe. Trains were detained In Texas,
New/ Mexico and Arizona. There is no hy
draulic mining to be called to account In those
Instances. In the mouths of mountain gorges,
everywhere, are fan-shaped cones, consisting:
of discharged sediment, etc., hundreds
of feet deep, covering from five to twenty-five
square miles at the mouths of torrential
i" '-earn?. Hydraulic mining has no part in
tbla.
All rivers coming from mountains to a flat
country deposit sediment In their' beds and fill
up their beds between the lowlands. They
run, often, twenty and even more feet above
the lowlands In their borders. This Is true
of the Sacramento River and also of the Mis
sissippi and the Po, along which last named
two no hydraulic mining takes place. The del
tas and bars at their mouths are formed simi
larly.
Professor Christy then went on to
speak of what happens wnen rivers
are permitted to follow their natural
bent and said in part:
JUDGE- IS 3HSTAKEN.
If left to itself a river tends to correct this
In flood times by overflowing Its banks and de
positing fresh soil upon the adjacent lowlands.
How little Judge. Sawyer and Colonel Mendill
appreciated this fact! In a decision Judge
Sawyer said:
"The evils resulting from occasional overflow
or pure water, or water deteriorated only by
natural erosion and causes and which leave
no deleterious sediment behind to permanently
destroy the land, are trifling compared with
those resulting from the enormous amount
from hyaraulic mining.".
Ask the managers of the Southern Pacific
and the Santa Fe what they think of' this
statement. In a decision of January 7, ftt84.
Judge Sawyer, quoting Colonel . Mendell, says:
â¢â¢The preservation of river beds and routes of
drainage requires that effective restraint be
imposed upon mining detritus. Otherwise the
drainage lines may be expected to suffer the
fate which overtook their prototypes, the Plio
cene rivers, which were obliterated by enor
mous deposits brought down by their own cur
rents."
Here are the bane and the antidote. Did
Judge Sawyer and Colonel Mendell charge the
hydraulic miners with filling up the Pliocene
rivers? If not, is the existence of 300 feet of
gTavel an answer to tho charge that the hy
draulic miner is the culprit? ,
Professor Christy then read a state
ment that he had prepared from dat|i
supplied by Geologists Chamberlain
and Salisbury, who have recently is
sued a work on geology from the Uni
versity of Chicago, which showed the
annual deposits of sediment due to ero
sion to be as follows in a number of
rivers, per square mile: Potomac, 4;
Mississippi, 214.4; Rio Grande. 2.8; Uru
guay, 10.6; Rhone, 31.1; Pg, 59; Danube,
93.2; Nile,, 3S.8; Irawaddy, 209. These
figures do not Include the great cones
in torrential streams.
There were no figures relating to Cal
ifornia'in .the publication referred to,
but, taking the same proportion, Pro
fessor Christy found that the Sacra
mento River deposits in sediment by
erosion annually 10.56 feet to the square
n?ile, and that, in fifty-five years, since
1S49, the Sacramento River has depos
ited, in sediment by erosion 580.8' feet
to the square mile. Engineers variously
estimate the area destroyed by hydrau
lic mining at twenty-five miles, five to
ten feet deep. "The figures show," re
marked Professor Christy, "that at the
same rate per square mile of the water
shed of the MississipDi River, the Sac
ramento and San Joaquin rivers would
have dctroyed with sand and mud fifty
eight square miles, ten. feet deep, or
116 square miles, five feet deep."
LAW IS DOUBLE EDGED.
Another quotation from one of Judge
Sawyer's decisions was given and Pro
fessor Christy said regarding ( it and its
consequences:
Restraining hydraulic miners from dlncha'rg
lng bowlders, travel, sand, detritus, clay or
other material In suspension, if taken literally,
would close down not only the business of
every hydraulic miner, but every gold dredger,
drift, quartz and other mine in thiÂ« State;
also every cattle, â¢ sheep and hog ranch and
farm in Californta that, dischargee muddy wa
ter. ' . The Anti-Debris Asaociatlon has been
interpreting the letter ' of tho law. How
would ' the anti-debris people - like a dose of
the same mud?
The human agencies that augment erosion
and injure the navigable waters of the State
include the cutting of \ roads and railways,
cutting of timber, forest - flree, cattle, eheep
and hogs, plowing ' and tilling the soil, liy
draulic and other kind* of mining where tail
ing* Hre not restrained, ' building of levee? and
reclamation of tide and overflowed- lands, the
Oakland, Alameda- and Key Route moles.
"Shall all these industries cease?"
asked Professor Christy. "Literally ap
plied, Judge Sawyer's decision would
stop f armi n g as well as mining : and
anti-farming associations could appeal
to it to stop plowing and cattle raising;
spies could show that clay or .other
substance was discharged by these op
erations into the navigable waters of
the State." , -.
An editorial that appeared In The
San Francisco Call on November 23
was praised for Its clear showing con
cerning erosions. ,
: Rufus P. Jennings was quoted by the
speaker as saying that the river im
provement movers have no intention to
interfere. with the interests of the min
ors. "This," said Professor Christy, "is
too" Important to trust to chance."
;^Those(who are 'interested in the riv
ers and' other $ navigable waters of the
State '.were mentioned as follows: â > The
miners; in^the;. mountains" farmers in
the 'valley,', the mercantile interests of
San Francisco, the United States Navy
Yard:"at Mare Island, i,not only the peo
ple of California, but also.the whole
United States, depending on San Fran
ciscoBay as a naval center.on.the Pa
,cific " Ocean r.-f : ereat , strategic . impor
tance.' ; Figures had been supplied by
Prnfpssor 'â , Davidson from; th*> ciiam
survey* chart of 1900, and these were
quoted.
NAVIGATION' IX DANGER.
The area of San Francisco Bay is 301
square miles, and that of San Pablo
Bay 122 square miles. There are but
100 square miles that have a depth of
four feet of water, eighty-three square
miles in San Francisco Bay and sev
enteen square miles in San Pablo Bay.
Deeper draft vessels are built yearly. The
bay may be Injured for purposes of deep sea
navigation long before It is filled up. Mare
Island Navy-yard Is of great importance to
the Government in time of war and peace. It
must not be filled up -by the scouring of ths
Sacramento River. Great stretches of bay
are already useless. Our river problem differ*
from that of the Mississippi in several Im
portant points. Our rainfall ia concentrated
into a few short months. The flow varies
from one to ten times in the same year. Tho
carrying of sediment varies from one to 10OO
times. Our rivers are fed directly by torren
tial streams. Unless natural and artificial
sediment are kept from the rivers the levees
will simply convey this sediment through the
rivers, whose beds will rise and will-continue
to rise. The levees must be constantly built
higher Â«r.d the sediment will finally mi the
bay of San Francisco.
'"What must be done.?" was asked;,
and the answer was given as follows:
1. Equalize the flow by building storage
reservoirs in the mountains as the hydraulic
miners did, for water for power, mining and
irrigation, and so reduce the floods to a
minimum.
~. Restrain all gravel, grit, etc.. by causing
torrential ftreamj to deposit their burden on
waste lands near the foothills, thus making
tillable lands of the waste lands, and dis
cnarse the clear water to the rivers.
3. Levees may at first be needed to render
the stream navigable at low water, but flood
gateo should be provided to flood the Iowland3
and gradually build up the lowlands with
fresh soil. AVe already hear that valley lands
are becoming exhausted. The game experience
belongs to the Nile, where the new system
of irrigation to clear the water has replaced
the, old flooding system In muddy wa
ter. The old Egyptians learned thÂ« fructi
fying value of the # Ted Nile mud."
The first and most vital measure la to re
move the sediment from the torrential streams
before they enter the navigable streams, by
depositing 1 them on waste lands. If this la
done hydraulic mining may bo on without
injury to other Interests. If thl.x Is not done,
even If hydraulic mining is stopped forever,
the buildln? of levees Js worse than useless,
for It only insure- the conveyance of sediment
into the bay of San Francisco. If this Is done
little else la necessary.
DUTY OF GOVERNMENT.
George J. Specht was quoted to the
effect that the . mountain streams of
Europe, where there Is no hydraulic
mining, have wrought the same de
struction as has been causd at Marys
ville, only worse, for whole villages
have been destroyed by sand and
gravel. The following was said con
cerning the duty of the Federal Gov
ernment in the premises:
A detailed topographic study of the foothill
and valley region to necessary. The Ameri
can Union owes its existence to the hydraulic
miner. The United States courts abolished
this Industry and destroyed the earning power
of the hydraulic miner. Millions lie waiting
his manacled fnslnes. Does not the Govern
ment owe a debt to him? If all sediment,
natural and artificial, can be kept out of the
rivers hydraulic mining can be resumed not
only without injury to the farmer but to his
benefit. This Is a geological problem. It can
be settled only by able and experienced geol
ogists, not on a snap judgment, but after
careful, detailed (study of all the facts.
Congress has already put at the disposition
of the director of the United States Geological
Survey a large rotating fund to be used in
the study of Just such questions as this.
Hence, from these premises, Profes- '
sor Christy advised the California j
Miners' Association to memorialize the :
President of the United States to aid. |
The convened miners followed Profes
sor Christy's reasoning closely and ap- j
plauded him lustily when he concluded
his advice. Last evening the commit
tee on resolutions met and probably a
draft of the memorial to which great
importance Is attached will be sub
mitted to the convention- this morning:
In addition to the proceedings" that
led up to the adoption of the Dlan of
memorializing President Roosevelt, the
miners listened yesterday to instruc- i
tive addresses by L. J. Hohl concern- i
ingr gold dredging and Thomas W. Leg
gett relative to the diamond and gold
mines of South Africa. Yesterday aft
ernoon the miners went about the bay
and visited the Union Iron Works.
PLACES HOPE
IN NEW PACT
LONDON, Dec. 6.â In discussing the
prospects of the Anglo-American arbi
tration treaty, Sir Thomas Barclay,
who has been prominently identified
with the work of promoting amity be
tween the said to-day:
It is quite possible that the treaty under
consideration will be more far-reaching than
the Anglo-French treaty. The treaty of 1897
provided for the settlement of all difficulties
between Great Britain and the United States
without exception by arbitration. It need
hardly.be expected that the new treaty will
be in exactly the fame tfcrms as that signed
by the late Lord Pauncefote and Secretary Ol
ney, but it is most desirable that a treaty be
tween peoples speaking the same language and
having practically the same form of proce
dure should go a step further than the Anglo-
French treaty.
A good loan from the treaty of 1S97 would
be the clause providing that If one of the
parties raises the objection .that national honor
or vital interest is Involved, the arbitrators
f-heukl consist of an equal number of the na
tionality of the parties involved, and that if
the decision is given by a bare majority it
should become final -. If . not protested within
three rnonths. The reference to arbitration of
the Alaskan question showed that some such
clause Is quite workable.
The treaty of ISO" was defeated by twenty
six Senators, many of â  whom were influenced,
by Michael Davltt to believe that such a
treaty would delay the solution of home rule
for Ireland. To-day no one can possibly couple
the question of home rule with the question of
adopting peaceful business-like methods for
dealings with international difficulties. If the
majority of the United States Senate should
thwart the progress of arbitration to-day when
all minds ot men are shocked by horrors of
war in the Far East, and when all realize
how Indispensable it is to promote pacific
methods for the settlement of difficulties be
tween nations, there would be an outcry
throughout the world and the Senate would be
disgraced In the eyes of all mankind.
I know positively that several Senators who
voted against the treaty of 1S97 will now
vote for the treaty of arbitration. I would
cite the case of Senator Morgan of Alabama
who tcld me he had altered his views since
J807. I am perfectly sure that Senators
Money and Bacon are now good friends of the
treaty.

STARVED TO DEATH.
Our text to-day Is the story of thm
miser who taught his ass to' live on
straw, of which he gave him a smaller
portion every day.
Just as the miser had got him so
trained as to eat one straw a day â tho
poor ass died.
He is an ass who starves himself to
death â as thousands are doing:, misled
by foolish teachers â because their
stomachs have become too weak,
through neglect or disease, to do- the
work which nature has provided for
their stomachs to do.
Because the engine is out -of gear,
would you consign it to the Junk heap?
"Why, no-! Mend it! ,
Commit slow suicide because your di-
gestive organs leak?
Certainly not! Take Stuart's Dys-
pepsia Tablets.
One thing is sure as shooting.
You can never get a new stomach.
You must mend it, or it will lead you
a miserable existence.
The only way to mend it is to take
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets.
This has been practically and scien-
tifically demonstrated t>y the many
thousands whom Stuart's Dyspepsia
Tablets have positively cured, after
every other treatment of medicine, min-
eral waters, pills and slow, â¢ suicidal
starvation had failed.
These methods :-re all unscientific*â
therefore false.
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets are scien-
tific â therefore true, and successful.
' Having cured so many thousands â
many of whom doubtless ha,ve suffered
more than you doâ do we claim too
much when we say that Stuart's Dys-
pepsia Tablets will surely do good to
you?
Surely not.
Especially when we make it plain
that no promise is made to cure more
than -one disease â Dyspepsia.
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets are a
positive cure for just thte cne disease.
They are a scientific combination of
ingredients -which search out the weak
spots in all the digestive organs and
them make strong and well.
y They have an immediate digestive ac-
tion on undigested food, and thus,
v.hile curing we ': organs, they at the
same time help them to do their work.
They thus stand for all that 13 good
in the medical t atment of Dyspepsia,
and for nothing that is bad. r
They are not a fad but a. iact.
They .re safe, pleasant* certain and
permanent, and can be taken by the
most delicate invalids without fear of
harmful results.
There's Only One Way to
Get the Best of Whisky
And that is to let it alone. If you try
any other way it will get the best of
you. If you can't let it alone you need
Dr. McKanna's treatment. Dr. McKan-
na cures the liquor habit by destroying
the desire for liquor and putting thÂ«
system in its natural condition, wber*
liquor is' not needed to help the machin-
ery of the body to do its work. Dr.
McKanna effects a complete cure in three
days without the use of dangerous hy-
podermics, annoying confinement or bad
after effects. Dr. McKanna's treatment
is absolutely safe and cannot harm the
most delicate constitution. TVby wasta

Special Dispatch to The CalL
SAN JCSE, Dec 6. â The thirteenth
annual convention of the California
Fruit Gravers began its sessions at
the Unitarian Church this morning.
About two hundred of the leading fruit
and vine cen and those interested in
the auxiliary branches of the industry
were present when Ellwood Cooper,
chairman of the State Horticultural
Commlssbn, called the meeting to or
der. Tht convention promises to be
of much benefit to the fruit industry,
and fot tie next three days all phases
Â«f growng; packing, shipping and
marketiig of fruit will be discussed.
The fortxnost men in the science of
horticulture and agriculture will read
papers ujon the subjects and these
â¢will be dfceussed by those in attend
ance. Tht convention is held under
the auspic<s of the State Horticultural
CommisFioi.

Governor Pardee was to have de
livered an address but he failed to
appear, bekg prevented, as was stated
in a telegram from the Governor, by
Illness.
PRESIDENT'S ADDRESS.
President Ellwood Cooper then read
his opening address. The object of
this convertion. he said, is to better
organize the fruit gTowers in order
that they nay realize a fair compen
sation for tieir expenditure and labor.
One cf thÂ« most important subjects
to come before the convention, he
said, is thtt of finding a market for
their prodicts.
"I need cot call your attention to
the present demoralized condition of
the prune, raisin and orange growers,
and the dned fruit market generally,"
euid Cooper, "for you are already
aware of vhat fact, but the remedy is
in our owi hands. If we can organize,
combine curselves together and work
harmoniously we can control our o\vn
markets and secure fair profits for
our products. With prunes at 1^4
cÂ«Tits, raisins at 2 cents and other
fruits at similar ruinous prices, there
is nothing left for the fruit grower
but a choice between organization and
starvation."
The following recommendation
â¢was made by President Cooper in re
gard to a pure food law: "I recom
mend that a pure food law, or rather
a true label law. be passed after the
pattern cf the German law. For the
first offense a fine of JoO and impris
onment for sis months, and for each
subsequent offense an increase of pen
alty. The national law imprisons
counterfeiters of money. Counterfeit
ers of food products are a thousand
Concerning- insect pests Cooper said:
"Two parasites of the codlin moth
ar* now being propagated at the head
quarters of the Horticultural Commis
sion. They have also secured a lady
bird, which has kept the red scale in
subjection in the citrus orchards of
the Mediterranean. Some relief will
come from these parasites."
Cooper called attention to the re
cent investigation before the Inter
state Commerce Commission at Chi
cago at which Watson, the president
of the Porter Brothers Company, was
shown to have received more than
$2,000,000 in rebates from the rail
road, no part of which ever reached
the fruit grower. He referred to the
trusts and the great proSts they re
alized, and said that he believed legis
lution would be enacted to control
them.
' Messrs. Fowler, Worthen and Wool
sey were appointed a committee to re
port on the president's address.
WORK IX TIIK SCHOOLS.
Dr. Anderson of the State Poly
'technic School of San Louis Obispo
was noticed in the audience and he
was invited to address the meeting.
He sketched the school course on hor
ticulture and viticulture and the fea
tures in the work of the school. Dr.
Anderson said he was trying to make
â¢the- agricultural work the school of
th. sort that every boy performs on a
farm.
Secretary Isaac read his report,
,vhi(h showed the matters that had
tcme uri since the last convention.
At the opening of the afternoon
meeting President Cooper announced
th<- following resolutions committee:
John Markley, Geyserville; B. S. Wal
ton. Yuba City: E. T. Pettitt. Santa
O.ara County: F. L. Kellogg, Colita,
Santa Earbara County, and John S.

" Dr. David Starr Jordan delivered
: an address on the theory of "Selective
Freeding." He said: "Luther Burbank
rat first in this work. He said if there
was need for lap elephants thes*3
orald be produced by select breeding.
The commercial elephant is ferocious,
but if we wanted lap elephants In
time they would be bo pred that we
could hold them in arms, their tusks
would not be dangerous and their
.handling not distressing to them." The
propagation of flowers as carried on
by Burbank was referred to by Jor
dan and he told how it was done and
what selection has resulted in.
"The Cross Pollenization In the Cul
ture of Apples." was the subject of a
paper by A. N. Judd of WatsonvlIIe.
The speaker told of an experiment of

his. a young minister who had been de-
clared by Chicago physicians to be fatal-

yond medical aid. In fact, he was at that
moment in Southern California, where hb

climate would prolong his life.
Mr. Lee Informs us that the nephew
â¢has practically recovered and we learn
from a private letter from him that he is
again about nis dally duties and has ap-
plied for insurance.
If anybody questions this statement a
letter will reach Mr. Lee at Pasadena,
where he and his estimable wife are stop-
ping for th*Â» winter.

In three seasons he had redeemed the
orchard and the fruit produced by the

Frank E. Kellogg- of Santa Barbara
County read a paper on "Needed Leg
islation." The laws that were essential
were noted.
The teaching: of the principles of
agriculture in the public schools was
treated in a paper by John S. Dore of
Fresno.
PARCELS POST.
Edward Berwick of Monterey read
a paper on "The Fruit Grower and
the Parcels Post." The advantages of
the parcels post in other countries was
related and he showed that much
benefit would accrue to the people of
this country and especially the fruit
gTowers if in operation here.
This evening the visitors were ten
dered a reception by the ladies of the
San Jose Grange lf[ the parlors of the
Unitarian Church. A fine musical pro
gramme was presented and a number
of short addresses were made. Re
freshments were served.
The programme of the convention
to-morrow Is as follows:

PASSES FROM EARTH WITH
BUT A SINGLE MOURNER
Eva Ray Hamilton. Who Figured in
Sensational Case, Dies in
New York.
NEW YORK. Dec. 6.â Eva Ray
Hamilton, alleged to be the notorious
woman whose career was linked with
the trade death of Robert Ray Ham
ilton, is dead. She died on November
23 last In a charity ward In St. Vin
cent's Hospital, and was buried in the
common plat in Mount Olivet Ceme
tery. No funeral service was held, and
her coffin, a box of cheap stained wood,
was lowered into its resting: place with
out a word.
Only one mourned her death, a man,
who had been known in the house
where she lived as "Mr. Hamilton,"
her husband, although he frankly ad
mitted that his name was assumed. He
says he knows that she was Eva Ray
Hamilton, and says that at a later date
he will offer letters and documents to
prove it. Those who saw the woman in
her last days say they would have
recognized her from the newspaper
pictures in spite of the fact that her
beauty had faded, her cheeks sunken
and her hair had become a now white.
Forty-seven was her age as given on
the death certificate, although owing
to the lines which suffering and dissi
pation had left on her face, she seemed
to be ten or fifteen years older.
It will be recalled that Robert Ray
Hamilton, her husband, was murdered
in the "West and the woman claimed
his property. The suit was settled for
$10,000.

.Wished to Have Identified
Special Dlacatch to Tbe Call,
LOS ANGELES, Dec. 6. â On a special
train running: as fast as the locomotive
could carry them and having in cus
tody a manacled prisoner three Santa
Fe railroad detectives raced with death
to-day and death won. They had ar
rested a man who answered the de
scription given bv Express Messenger
Roberts of the robber who yesterday
morning shot him and looted ,one of the
express company's safes upon the
westbound Overland train. Soon after
the capture thev learned that at the
Sisters' Hospital in Los Angeles Rob
erts was dying and with all possible
speed they tried to get their prisoner
before him for identification.
While the special was en route from
San Bernardino the doctors at the hos
pital were administering oxygen and
other restoratives in the hope that they
could keep Roberts conscious long
enough to see the prisoner. From time
to time the doctors were told of the
progress of the race and finally when
the train dashed into Los Angeles they
thought they would win. but while the
officers and their prisoner were en
route from the train to the hospital
Roberts' heart failed and he expired.
Unless a confession is secured some
time from the man who shot him, it
will never be known positively who the
robber was. Beyond the fact that the
prisoner answers the description given
by Roberts the officers have little evi
dence against the suspect other than
his suspicious movements, which have
been traced.
The facts connected with the arrest,
however, have been kept secret, but it
is known that the man, whose name
has not been made public, was at Dag
gett before the robbery; that he left
there saying he was going to the borax
mines; that he secretly returned to the
railroad and was at the station when
the Overland rolled in. After that it is
known that he made several wide de
tours touching the railroad only when
necessary for him to secure food.
A posse organized by Sheriff Ralphs
g-ot on his trail, made detour for detour
and finally captured him near Ludlow.
What they found on him the officers
refuse to disclose, but it Is believed
they have strong evidence against the
man.
A negro named "Williams was brought
here last night by railroad detectives.
To-day he -was released, but later was
rearrested and the detectives will per
mit no person not working on the case
to see him.
The rewards for the capture of the
bandits now aggregate $2300. The San
ta Fe and Wells-Fargo companies have
each offered 51000 reward and there
is a standing: State reward of $300. The
booty secured by the robber consists
of two drafts for a total of $5000 and
$300 in gold.
MESSAGE CALLS
FORTH PRAISE
English Press Commend j
Utterances of Roosevelt
in His Latest Document
LONDON, Dec. 7.â "We may see in
this message, the words of Police Con
stable Roosevelt of the International
Police," says the Daily Chronicle in an
editorial this morning.
On the whole, the press of London re
gard the message as a statesmanlike,
highly courageous and notable docu
ment, which the Morning Post ven
tures to think "will do more than any
public utterance of recent years to in
crease sympathy between Britons and
Americans," following- this expression
with the passage from -the message
where President Roosevelt speaks of
his foreign policy as one for which the
English-speaking world will now and
hereafter be thankful.
A majority of the newspapers edi
torially approve of President Roose
velt's advocacy of a strong army and
navy In order to preserve 'the peace
of Justice," and acquit Roosevelt of
any Jingoism.
Some, on the other hand, consider
the message injurious to the ideals of
disarmament- and arbitration. The
Daily Graphic, for example, thinks the
message "will strengthen the advocates
of bloated armaments in every coun
try."
The Dally Telegraph pays a tribute
to President Roosevelt's "courageous
recognition of thorny problems," and
says: "It is a positive relief to con
trast his virile language on the sub
ject of foreign policy with the anaemic
femininities which find shrill utterance
in England."
The Standard says that on the ques
tion of a strong navy President Roose
velt will carry with him the sympa
thetic concurrence of most English
men.
BERLIN, Dec. 6.â German interest
In President Roosevelt's message to
Congress centers peculiarly In the sec
tions that deal with the army and
navy and the trust and labor prob
lems. The newspapers print summar
ies of about 2000 wo^ds and their com
ment generally is faVorable.

Aged Bishop
Will Retire
in England
AGED BISHOP WHO WILL, SOON
RETIRE Fr.OM THE CHURCH
IN ENGLAND.
LONDON, Dec. 6.â When it was ru
mored last August that Dr. Elllcott,
Bishop of Gloucester, was about to va
cate his see, the aged prelate gave a
vigorous denial to the story. His ap
proaching: retirement is now authori
tatively
Born eighty-five years ago, with a
record of forty-one years' service on
the Episcopal bench, he is easily the
doyen of Anglican Bishops. Until a
very recent period his physical and
mental strength seemed little impaired
by the assaults of time. For many years
he was one of the most ardent of Al
pine climbers, and when he was nearly
seventy he crossed the Aletsch Glacier
alone and in a snowstorm. At dinner
that same night he made light of his
adventure.
A hard worker all his life and proud
of his health and strength, he has al
last reluctantly yielded to the persua
sions of his friends that he should de
vote what remains of his life to the
rest he has so richly earned.
To him, more than to anybody, else,
the church is indebted for the "Revised
Version" of the New Testament. |At
Cambridge, in his young: days, he ae
voted himsef to its historical study.
Bringing to his task, as^be, years went
by, the accumulations -of a profound
scholarship and intimate acquaintance
with Hebrew literature, he became
convinced of -the necessity for a,ne\v
translation, but he feared that he
could not arouse sufficient interest and
sympathy in the project to obtain the
sanction of the church for the work,
and it was more or less as a forlorn
hope that he induced Bishop Wilber
force to bring the matter before the con
vocation in 1870. To his surprise and
gratification a committee was appoint
ed to undertake the task, of which, as
the man best fitted for the position,
he was made chairman.
It has been said that he possesses
a gold pass that enables him to travel
free, on any English railroad. This Is
a slight exaggeration, but he has a
silver life pass on the Great Eastern,
which he won, so to speak. In a rail
road accident on that line. On that
unfortunate occasion both his legs were
broken, but while he lay in agony he
administered spiritual consolation to a
fellow sufferer In the disaster. The

More Persons Connected With
Colorado Elections Fraud
Guilty of Wrongful Acts
OTHER CASES W COURT
Grand Jury Instructed to
Begin a Eigid Inquiry
Into the Charges of Fraud
DENVER, Dec. 6.â Six more election
officials were sent to Jail to-day by the
State Supreme Court for disregarding
Its injunctive order at the late elec
tion. The ! sentences were as follows:
William Reid. S. S. Barker. John E.
Dixo-n and John Sullivan, nine months'
imprisonment and $500 fine, with coats
each; W. E. Spencer, four months' Im
prisonment; Charles W. Bunch, three
months' imprisonment. Sullivan was a
Democratic committeeman, Reid, Bar
ker and Spencer Judges and Di*on and
Bunch clerks in Precinct 9 of Ward 5
in this city, the ballot-box of which was
opened in court last Friday, disclosing
many fraudulent ballots.
The court to-day tried the election
contempt case from Precinct 6 of Ward
7. The defendants are: William Berg
man, an election Judge; J. Kitson, an
election judge, and James P. llullins
and Patrick Reid. Democratic workers.
The charges are that no Republican
clerk was allowed; that Republican
Watcher C. H. Sanson was violently
removed from behind the rail; that Su
preme Court watchers were not per
mitted to examine the registration lists
and that the Republican challengers'
book was taken from her.
J. Fred Roberts, one of the watchers,
testified that repeaters appeared at the
polls every few hours In bunches of
from five to a dozen and wefe allowed
to vote.
District Judge John I. Mullins to-day
delivered his instructions to the Qrand
Jury summoned by him in the Criminal
Court. He charged it to "make a thor
ough investigation as to all violations
of the law growing out of the recent
general â  election. He added:
In my opinion the lavish expenditure of
money, as has been witnessed In this county
and State, Is criminal. I believe it to be at
the \-ery root of all the crime and violations
of the election laws which haw accompanied
our recent elections. It ought to be made a
criminal offense for any corporation to con
tribute to any political party.

charged that to carry out this conspiracy It
will involve the unseating:, unjustly and Il
legally, of certain members of the coming
Legislature. It Is also charged that Immense
sums of money have been collected from the
various corporations of this city and State to
aid In this work. It Is charged that even

many counties of the State and certified to

TOKIO, Dec. 7, 11 a. m.â As a result
of the continuous bombardment by the
Japanese of Port Arthur the besiegers,
by using 203-Meter Hill as an observa
tion point, have 'discovered that one of
the Russian battleships in the harbor
has a 'heavy list. Owing to the fog the

BI/ACIC SKA CLOSED.
Russia Will Xot Send Fleet .Through
the -Dardanelles.* . ,
ST. PETERSBURG, Dec. 6.â The agl
iatfon raised in the newspapers on the
question of sending the Black Sea fleet
through the , Dardanelles to Join Ad
miral Rojestvensky's squadron has
been inspired by a faction of the Ad
miralty which is anxious to see the
second Pacific squadron re-enforced to
a point which will insure victory; but
there is not yet the slightest, evidence
that Russia is seriously considering
euch a step. The subject is a. popular
one in Russia, where there has always
existed much irritation against the
manner in which the Black Sea fleet is
bottled up, but Russian diplomats rec
ognize the difficulties surrounding the
vexed question of the Dardanelles and
the press is assured that the present
discussion is without significance.
The present treaties covering the
Dardanelles, it is pointed out, do not
provide for their denunciation. The
only regular way to obtain their modifi
cation or abrogation would be by a
congress of the powers signatory to the
treaties, similar to that of London in
1871, which legalized the maintenance
by Russia of a fleet In the- Black Sea.
The other alternative is for Russia to
simply announce her refusal to be any
longer bound by the treaties, in which
event the powers would be compelled
to adopt the measures which might
seem proper. Although egress from the
Black Sea might prejudice the position
of the Mediterranean powers, it is not
believed that any of them, except
Great Britain, .would act with the view
to continuing what Russia has. always
contended to be an unnatural situation.
Great Britain, how*ever, would probably
base her action .upon the theory that
the Japanese alliance compelled her to
prevent" the abrogation' of* treaties
which inure to the advantage of her
ally's enemy. . â¢ . , v. ;. . â¢ â 
J.n.this connection a dispatch to the
Xovoe Vremya from. London revives
the story of the existence of secret
clauses' in the 'Japanese-British alli
ance, one of 'which, the correspondent
claims, binds Great Britain to keep the
Black Sea fleet locked up, in return for
which Japan agrees not to send Japa
nese ships to European waters.
The Novoe Vremya's argument that
it is only necessary for Russia to ar
range with Turkey in order to. liberate
the Black SeÂ» fleet is pronounced by
the Foreign Office to be absurd, it be
ing pointed but that, Jf true, Great
Britain or any other power could ne
gotiate with Turkey for the ingress of
fleets without the Consent of the other
signatories. ; .?â 
KUKOPATKIX IX PERIjJ
Vague Dispatch Hints lit H^ent At
tempts Upon His IATc. -. â _. ;.'â¢.
ST. PETERSBURG, Dec. 6. â A very
curious dispatch . has. been received
from a correspondent, at General
Kuropatkin's headquarters about the
arrest of a Chinese, who was found
in possession of 500 feet of fuse used
in detonating: high explosives. The
telegram speaks of the' necessity for
providing a larger bodyguard for
General Kuropatkin. The wording of
the. dispatch generally leads to the
inference that an attempt made upon
the. cbmmander-in-chief's . life â  has
be^n foiled. No .confirmation of the
report Is obtainable here.
He drew- pay for all names, putting In his own
pocket thtÂ» amount â¢â¢Hotted' to the -imaginary
soldiers. When ICuropatkin, in his reconstruc
tion of his force*, put this matter of payment
un a business basis th* ofttcers covered their
duplicity by Including the. dummy names In
their lists o' killed. .'.>.--
Bass speaks with admiration of the
Japanese artillery forces. With guns
of 1000 Â£eet less range than those of
the Russians, the little brown men,
under cover of darkness, planted their
batteries near enough to overcome the
handicap an<J then made it so hot for
the Czar's men that in most artillery
duels the Japanese got the decision
and not a few Russian guns.
. Japanese, losses since the beginning
of' thÂ» .war have been much greater,
says Bass, 'than stated .in , the official
reports from Tokio. He says that
berl-beri has been almost as fatal as
Russian bullets. He does not think
there will be much winter fighting in
Manchuria. . . â ; .
Speaking of Port' Arthur. Bass/ says
that ex-Ser>ator Washburn's son.; who
is acting <"'s correspondent with the
Russians for the Chicago Dally. News
syndicate, left .Port Arthur about : six
weeks siRO. Washburn told him that
the Japanese hadnot taken one of the
seventeen permanent forts.-and that
the people in the fortress are confi
dent ,of beine'able to hold.- out- until
the arrival of the Baltic fleet.

MOSCOW, Dec. 6.â A special dis
patch from .Vladivostok; says- that a
steamship which has just arrived there
from Shanghai reports that the Jap
anese armored ' cruiser Adzuma has
been blown up and sunk by a mine.
Thi Adzuma, also referred to aa the
Asuma and Adsuma. was built at St.
Xazairei France, and was launched in
li'01. j She'carrled four eight-inch
gruns, twelve six-inch guns and twenty
four smaller rapid-flre guns, had five
torpedo tubes and a complement of
4 82 men.
The cruiser is said to have been
sunk north' of the Miaoto Islands.
. The Mlaoto Islands are in the Liao
tie Channel, between the Kwantung
Peninsula, . on which Port Arthur is
Bituated, and the Shantung promono
tory. â  â  .- ' . \;U-
; TOKIO. Dec; 6. â The following re
port Â£ias been received from the head
quarters of the Japanese army before
tort Arthur: ,. . >
"On December 8 our naval guns (on
208-Meter Hill) combarded the ene
my's ships. The battleship Pobieda
was struck . six times: On a vessel ot
the type of the battleship . Retvizan
and on eight other ships sixteen of our
shells took effect.
"On Monday, December 6, follow
ing: the same plan,' we hit the Pobieda
seven times, the battleship' Poltava
eleven times, and the Retvizan eleven
times. '. .-. :.--.r-W.:;; :
"At about 3 o'clock on the afternoon
oÂ£ the- same day one of our shells
structc a_ magazine, south of Paiyu
Mountain. .This, caused a heavy ex
plosion and a- conflagration followed,
which, was not extinguished for two
hours. Â« . :.- / â ?:
"On the same day our heavy guns
were directed against the enemy's
ships. The . battleship Peresviet was
struck twice. Two more shells were
lodged on other ships. A vessel of the
type of the battleship Poltava was ob
served to be on.flre, and for one hour
stnt out a great volume of smoke.
"The ... attacking operations against
Sungshu Mountain and the forts to
the eastward are carried on day and
nighu ' Two 36-miiUmeter quiekrfiring
guns were captured on Sunday, De
cember 4, on . the half-moon counter
scarp of Rlhluiig; Mountain." . .
. .The ; effective; bombardment of. the
l,iuti^jan battleships .'.in. Port Arthur
was one of ttl'e results "of the capture
of 2O3.-Meter" ! Hill. Up > to that time
the warships had been able to .seek
shelter from the Japanese fire'under
Ff-iyu Mountain, but the capture of
203iMeter Hill on November 23-30 en
abled the Japanese to train their gruns
on the Russian vessels, with the re
sult that a number of them have been
set on fire and the others must either
put to sea. or suffer irreparable dam
age.
The Russians are nightly attacking
203-Meter Hill at Port Arthur, in a
determined effort to retake it. The
Japanese are increasing the defenses
of the p6sltfon and have succeeded so
far In repelling all assaults. The Rus
sians have suffered the heavier losses
and It is estimated that they have
sacrificed 3000 men in their effort to
recapture the ground which the Jap
anese are confident in their ability to
hold. Observations Indicate that
the garrison is feeling the effects of a
shortage of men.
â¢The works against Sungshu Moun
tain and the' forts to the eastward
are 'progressing: speedily and all indi
cations point -to an early greneral as
sault, although" the date it will be
made is kept secret. It is expected
that the next general assault will
prove successful.

m. â Although the War Office' and Tthe
-Admiralty- are^st'lll â¢without- direct. tfews
from Port Arthur, - confidence in. 'the
ability of.tfie fortress to, hold out con
tinues to be expressed. The reports
'from Tokio of the, shelling of the bat-
Iie3hips : "arid of hea.vy losses' by; the
Russians) In ah Ineffective attempt to
recapture 203-Meter Hill are considered
misleading. ' Accordfhgr to a high offi
cer of the general staff, the Warships
would \>e able to seek shelter from the
fire from 203-Meter Hill: by anchoring
behind; Tiger's Tail peninsula; Reports
that the Russians are clearing the mine
fields outelde the_ harbor are regarded
â¢as the best indication that the squad
ron is. preparing to move out to this
anchorage, where it will be secure un
der the protection of the shore bat
teries. .
An artillerv officer who knows Port
Arthur thoroughly expresses the belief
that the Japanese will be unable to
hold the summit of 203-Meter Hill, on
account of the fire of the Antz and Etz
forts, which are less than two miles
distant. This officer declares that it
will be impossible for the Japanese to
mpunt guns at the top of 203-Meter Hill
until the ammunition of the Antz and
Etz forts is exhausted.
The Tokio estimate that the Russians
lost 3000 in .the attempt to recapture
203-Meter Hill Is declared to be absurd,
and it is pointed out that such a loss
would imply the virtual crippling of the
resistance, yet the reports from Tokio
admit that General Stoessel continues
to make counter-attacks.

Daring Fellow Is Success
fully Landing Contraband
in Besieged Eussian Port
- Lpuis Spitzel, formerly of this city,
where he is well known. Is piling up a
forttme in the Orient by running con
traband articles of war Into thÂ« be
sieged. Port Arthur. Spitzel's opera
tions, which the Japanese have been
trying- to stop for a number of months.
are said to have materially assisted the
gallant General Stoessel in his heroic
stands before the gritty little Japanese.
The information concerning: Spltzel'a
daring adventures was brought hero
yesterday by H. Franket, 'who arrived
from the Orient and is sfaylng at the
Palace Hotel. Frankel has also been
successfully engaged in the smuggling
of goods into Port Arthur and has
mafle a comfortable fortune, which he
haa brought with" ilm to* the United
States to enjoy.
Frankel was one of the first to at
tempt to run the blockade at Port
Arthur before the Japanese took New
chwang. His vessel was the Victoria,
an old craft brought from Australia.
It was condemned at Shanghai and sold
to Chinese for $5000. The first trip was
made with a cargo of petroleum and
came near ending:. In a disaster. The
vfcssel was in such bad condition that
she frequently broke down and it took
her a full eight days to cover the dis
tance from Shanghai to the entrance
of Port Arthur- In discussing: Spltzel
last evening Frankel said: WPS

Frankel said that so urgent is the
need of foodstuffs and ammunition In
Pert Arthur that smuggling has been
made an exceedingly profitable busi
ness and has been the only thing that
has saved Shanghai from a collapse of
Its commercial affairs.
ORDERED AWAY

Marcel de Smet Laberghe, war cor
respondent for Le Matin of Paris, who
ran the blockade into Port Arthur, Svas
a passenger on the liner Siberia from
Nagasaki to Shanghai. He told the
officers of the Siberia that he had been
well treated by the Russians and was
allowed the freedom of the fortress.
He said the Russians had plenty of
food and ammunition, but were poorly
provided with water. He said the Jap
anese shells had destroyed all but one
of the flour mills in Port Arthur. La
berghe left on September 29 in an open
boat. He was picked up by a Japanese
torpedo-boat and . taken to Sasebo. a
â¢prisoner. â 
He refused to tell the Japanese of
conditions in Port Arthur. - He was
given his liberty, -but was kept under
strict surveillance. Typhoid fever then
bowled him over. When convalescent
he was taken to Nagasaki, where he
was ordered to . take the first steamer
for Shanghai.
, He was escorted aboard the Siberia
by Japanese police, one of whom ac
companied him. shadowing his every
movement and lending; an attentive ear
whenever the Frenchman engaged In
conversation. SJMSBBS&iMfiHBi
Sydney Smith erf the London Mail al
so traveled on the Siberia from Yoko

Another passenger in Asiatic waters
was Captain Carthlage, whose ship, the
Ti Shan, was seized by tne Japanese.
The owners of the vessel, through the
British Consul, are making a stiff fight
to Becure the vessel's release.

before Justice Davis. Six of the seven

Up to the last half hour the work of
selecting; men to sit In the trial had
proceeded 'slowly; only two having: been
accepted. . When the change came and
thf sixth and seventh places were fill
ed quickly -Miss -Patterson- showed
every sign of satisfaction, and assured
her father, who sat beside her, of her
confidence' in an early 'acquittal.
As one after another of the talesmen
taker Ma place on the stand to s undergo
a searching examination by the at
torneys for both the prosecution and
the. .defence, . he .- is .subjected to tho
searching scrutiny of the accused wo
man. His\Â«very act Is noted by her,
and to her the attorney for the defense
always looks for a nod. of approval or
a head . shake indicating ,her dissatis
faction before the linal -word .is given.
In the first trial it was said -that
â¢"Nan". Patterson chose her own-jury.
When the case came to a, sudden and
unexpected end she expressed regret.'
.'â¢I v.as *sure*that jury "would acquit
me," she said, as she was. led away. to
her. cell in the Tombs. ; from her atti

will do her best to select twolve men
who will be as acceptable to her ns

, ; AUBURN. Dec. 6.â The - Supervisors
of Placer County are of the opinion
that District Attorney -I^elly. Robinson
is not â¢'capable of conducting the prose
cution of Adolph Weber for the murder
of his mother, and they want; the State
to . furnish . a more able prosecutor. The
sentiment or the Supervisors f was
voiced to-day in a. resolution, adopted
by them asking State Attorney General
U." S. Webb to take a hand in the-pro
ceedings. The resolution; in ' part, is
as- follows: - â .,- ._. -.., :j ,.â¢..â¢
It J.as . been made to appear to this board
that a larpe numtK-r of prominent and substan

opinion that MtdNlJlstrlct Attorney is not equal
to the' cotidv.ct and manasement oC the said
prosecution that 5s represented to this board,
and we p.re sntl*!led -therefrom that the said
Dlttrict Attorney doe? not realize the magni
tude" ef thÂ» undertaking- before him nor of the
ifcsponsibilitles which have been thrust upon
lvs office, and that he intends to assume the
conduct end management of the tame, and
unless stecs are tnken to r-revt-nt it the pub
lic service will suffer great . detriment there
.by." The said District Attorney has refund
and continues to refuse, to accept the aid of
able and efficient counsel which the relatives
of thÂ« murdered family have rendered him,
and such aid as the public generally have de
manded that he accept. We, therefore, know
ing of no other eoutsj cpen to us, as repre
sentatives of the nublic, to prevent a prob
able miscarriage of Justica. for these reasons,
urgently but respectfully request you, ins At
torney General of the State of California, to
comply. with this request. . â¢
A similar resolution, bearing the
names of seventeen members of the
Grand Jury, was adopted by that bedy
and forwarded to Webb. It was ac
companied by a petition requesting
Webb to join in the prosecution of We
ber, signed by nearly every man of
prominence in the town of Auburn.
Weber asked to see both his attorneys
this afterneon, and it Is rumored that
he wanted their assistance In making
his will. The prisoner has not been
feeling well for the; last few days and
fears that close confinement may kill
him.
When Weber is â  called to plead to
morrow the defense will set , rÂ« the
claim that the prosecution has not es
tablished jurlsdicttpjr. because Jj: 1 did
not at the preliminary hearing estab
lish the, fact that Mrs.' Weber was

by Court, the Prosecution
Failing to Implicate Her
PORTLAND, Dec. 6.â After deliber
ating for thirty- five minutes, the Jury
in the United States District Court to
day returned a verdict finding S. A.
D. Puter,; Horace G. McKinley, Emma
L. "Watson . and D. "v7. Tarpley guilty
of conspiracy to defraud the United
States Government out of the title of
a portion of its nubile land?.
1 he day commenced with the argu
ment of Special Prosecutor Francis J.
Heney in behalf of the Government.
It was nopn when Heney had finished
his address. At 2 o'clock Judge Bel
linger delivered his charge, which con
sumed but ten minutes. In his instruc
tions to the Jury, Judge Bellinger
asked for the acquittal of Miss Marie
Ware, who the prosecution admitted
on Saturday was not sufficiently im
plicated in the present case to warrant
her conviction. As the jury retired to
deliberate the court announced a re
cess until such time as a decision
should be reached. â¢'-.?.--'
At 10 minutes to 3 the jury filed back
into the room and the bailiff handed
the verdict to the court, who passed It
to theclerk. . The verdict follows:
"We, the jur>\ find the defendants,
Emma L Watson, S. A. D. Puter.
Horace G. McKinley, D. W. Tarpley
and Frank H. Wolgamot, guilty of the
crime' of .conspiracy^ to ...defraud the
Government out of a part of Its public
lands, situated In township 11 south/ of
range 7 east, as charged. We find the
defendant, Marie L. Ware, not guilty."
Attorney Hall asked that the defen
dants be placed under additional bonds
in this case; but the court decided that
a bond of . $4000 in the present case
would, be ample, and therefore â¢ ordered
that such security be given. Thia will
place the defendants each under $4000
bonds for each of the thiee cases, with
the exception of Tarpley and Wolga
mot, who do not figure in the suc
ceeding cares.
There is -no doubt that an appeal
will be taken. The attorneys for the
defense are now preparing their mo
tion for a new trial, , and will, in all
probability, present it at . the opening
of the next case on December 13.

Annual Report of Prof. Hilgard
Says LTniversity Farm Should
Be in an Interior County.
Berkeley Office San Francisco Call,
1'14 8 Center Street, Dec. 6. 1
Professor K. \V. Hiljjard. in his an
nual report just submitted to Presi
dent Benjamin Ide Wheeler, refers
with special emphasis to the urgent
reed of a new building for the agri
cultural department of the university,
declaring: himself as follows:
It U particularly gratifying that simultane
ously the attendance of student* en the courses
In agriculture hag also materially Increased to
as to tender our former accommodations and
appliances lor instruction painfully inadequate..
Jn several courses the lecture-rooms at our
eommstid have become too small to hold the
classes without uncomfortable crowding; a; â¢
the means of demonstration, which were quite
effective, for smaller classes, now prove wholly
Inadequate to the proper Instruction of the
larger number* or students, of which but too
many find It difficult to *eÂ« or hear with our
present arrangements. j
The largely increased attendance at
the College of Agriculture is referred
to in the report. Regarding the in
adequacy of the field area available
p.t Berkeley for a university farm, for
Instruction and experiment. Professor
Hilpard says:
The unsu-.tablene ?s of the location from cli
matic cause*, situated as it Is within the bÂ«lt
ef extreme coast climate, accentuated by the.
direct Impact of the ccld Eummer fogs pouring
througrh the Golden Gate, has been repeatedly
Adverted to in former reports. Hence the
frround available has been utilized mainly in
the preparation cf plants and the production
cf Â«eedÂ« for distribution to more representative
region* of the State; whence, as wen as from
our substation?, have ccme the practically use-"
ful cultural results from the introduction of
rÂ»w plant* and the testing of cultural methods.
The prospective occupancy of the entire uni
versity site fnr building and ether educational
purposes within a more cr less remote time has
necessarily prevented the full utilization of the
available space for purposes of instruction In
nctu&l field practice, a* well as the inaugura
tion of FVEtematlc cultural experimentation,
even if the exceptional climatic conditions had
rendered the undertaking profitable.
SLOW HEADWAY
IN CHINATOWN
No progress was made yesterday af
ternoon by the Police Commissioners
in the hearing of the charges of corrup
tion in Chinatown. It was the inten
tion of the commission to examine the
contents of the safes taken from the
framing place of Chin Kim You at S20
Washington street, but District Attor
ney Byington refused to sign a stipu
lation, with Jacob S. Meyer, Chin's at
torney, regarding the disposition of the
contents of the safe and the Commis
eioners refused to assume the responsi
bility, with the result that search war
rant proceedings pending before Judge
Cabaniss must be prosecuted to a con
clusion. The stipulation presented by
Meyer for signature showed on its face
that Chin feared no disclosures as a
result < f the examination of the con
tents of the safe.
The stipulation was to the effect that
the money should be returned, though
the papers might be used.
This offer did not tempt the commis
sion to proceed without advice from the
District Attorney, however, so the case
was continued to the regular meeting
in the evening when it was decided to
again take up the case to-morrow af
ternoon at 2 o'clock.
At the meeting of the commission
last evening the license of Ixmis Good
man, a pawnbroker at 19 Montgomery
avenue,- was revoked for irregularities.
The license of Filbert Tomasinl, who
conducted a saloon at Jackson and
Mason streets, was revoked after he
had been convicted of pool selling.
Nicholas Tasiopolls. who conducted a
restaurant at 777 .Folsom street, also
lost his license upon the showing that
he conducted a disorderly resort, â¢â 
Robert L^ass. who conducted the
Bowhead saloon, lost his license for
giving customers ammonia to Bmell
when th?y asked for gin to drink.
A petition requesting the board to In
struct the City Attorney to dismiss the
appeal in the case of Patrolman Harry
Hook, ordered reinstated as sergeant
by Judge Hebbard, was denied.
Patrolman Charles C. T. Russell was
fined $50 for being absent from his

HAVE YOU YOl'R TICKET
FOR PRESS CLUB NIGHT?
The Press Club entertainment com

"King Dodo," if such a thing is nos-
Fible. But those who have ever en
joyed a jinks at the Ellis-street head
quarters of the organization know
â¢what this particular committee can
do. Its function is to provide^ r.'ood
music and other things worth ha&r
ing or seeing. To-morrow evening at
the Tivoli Opera-house the "event of
the Reason" will take place and the
entertainment committee is going to
do its share of "providing."
A large part of the house has been
Bold out and those who desire Â«j;at3
would better apply at the theater to
day yc early to-morrow. The advance
sale of seats has been unusually
large and nearly all of the boxes have
been spoken for. There is sure to be
a representative gathering of news
paper men and prominent people of
the city.
"King Dodo" in itself is an excep
tionally clever opera and has been
highly praised by critics. The Press
Club believes that it can be improved
upon, however, and has undertaken
to introduce local "hits" and "Joshes"
that will undoubtedly create hearty
laughs.
Between acts there will be that
which is typical of the aptitude of the
newspaper men to entertain and this
mak*Â»s it sure that it will be "a great
double bill."
A handsome souvenir programme
will bo nresentefl all who attend the
performance. t
Press Women Jicbre Point.
Another demurrer to the complaints
of Mate H. Cartwright and Marian B.
Foster against the Pacific Coast Wom
en's Press Association was sustained
yesterday by Judse Hunt on the
ground that it cannot be ascertained
from th*Â» complaint what were the
rule* of the association that are al
1Â« ped in the complaint not to have
piNsn observed when the plaintiffs were
â¢spelled from membership. ' Mrs. Fos
ter and Mrs. Cart>vrij?ht are each suing
f<:r S1OO.O00 damage*. They were
river ten days in which to amend their
plrr-dirsr.
With the increase of students In agriculture
proper, and the inerea6ed Interest tn the work
of the college and experiment station among
lhÂ» farming population, together with thÂ« Im
mediate pronpect of the. construction of new
buildings upon the permanent plan, the estab
lishment of a university .farm, such as forms
part of the equipment of nearly all other ag
ricultural colleges of this country, becomes a
matter or pressing need. Such a farm Is as
much nced<d for proper and practical Instruc
tion In agriculture as are the laboratories of
the mining, mechanical engineering and other
colleges.
â  t may, however, be necessary to discuss
more 'in detail some ideas which have been
expressed In this connection by friend* of
the movement, but xrtiich threaten to so far
overshoot the mark really to be aimed at aa
tÂ» seriously Jeopardize the. usefulness of the
contemplated needful addition to our working
appliances. This has arisen, in part, from
a confusion of Ideas in regard to the propet
Â»nd legally prescribed sphere of tbÂ« agricul
tural college, as contradistinguished from ag
ricultural high schools, bearing the same re
lation to the former that the high schools at
present existing, bea- to the State university
at larre. -â  . â 
Wherever college farms exist in the United
States as weir as abroad they are located in
immediate proximity to the college, so that
the college student* can utilize them In their
studie*. juit as they would other laboratories.
The propriety and Importance of such colloca
tion hardly need any dlicusslon. .. .
One of the most encouraging 1 features Â©I
the pa*t year was the Increased attendance
upon the courses of the college of agriculture.
It Is quite obvious that if agricultural topics
were introduced into the rural graded schools
instead of <not in addition to) much tra
ditional Irrelevant matter haoded down from
formÂ«r times and often badly taught In a
perfunctory manner, and if such instruction
were afterward continued in the high school
{trade the' attendance of students would soon
lax to the utmost the provision lor instruc
tion In agricultural science at the university.
This would go far toward solving the problem
now so commonly dlscuesed: "How to keep
the boys on the farm." Let the farm once
be made' , Interesting to the boys and girls
growing up In the country by suitable early
instruction and the tawdry attractions of city
life would soon cease to deplete the rural dis
tricts. -
FURTHER LIGHT
AS TO CHARGES
HELENA, Mont., Dec. 6. â Former
Senator Thomas H. Carter, president
at the national commission of the
Louisiana Purchase Exposition, made
a brief reply to-day to the Interview
with President Francis of the exposi
tion company relative to charges of
corruption made in regard to" about
thirty-five out of 35,000 awards. Ko
said he does not recall when any re
quest was made to the commission to
appear before ! the committee of flve
as stated by President Francis, jnd
claims that if such were the ease the
committee of-flve would assume the
character of prosecutor when ita func
tions were quasi-judicial. After re
ferring to the law In regard to making
awards, President Carter says:
ThÂ« rules governing tbe awarding of pre
miums provide, first, for group Juries; ' sec
ond, department juries, and, third, a superior
j'jry. The law provides that the awards shall
be made by the exposition company and ap
proved by tbÂ» national commission. As I re
call, the charges on file do not apply to the
superior Jury, but to the action of persons con
nected with group Juries and persons attempt
ing to deai with them. When the company
shall have mgds the awards and passed them
to the national commission for approval/ then,
ard only then, , can the commission properly
stid lcgal!> act. - .
I do not recall any request to the commis
sion us appear before a committee of flve to
present charges, as 'stated by Mr. Francis,
but if such ha* been made, the committee
could not as*umÂ«r the character of a prosecutor

Hole Drilled in Treasure

Berkeley Office San Francisco Call,

Amateur safe-crackers made a bun
gling attempt last night to rifle the
strong box in the office of the People's
Express Company, at 2211 Shattuck
avenue. After drilling almost through
the big steel lock on the box they gave
up the job and contented themselves
with opening and stealing goods in the
office consigned to patrons of the ex
press company.
Two men are believed to have been
concerned in the job, as the big steel
box they sought to despoil was carried
by them for twenty feet, through a door
into the store-room of the building.
Marshal Kerna has been informed
that only persons familiar to some
extent with the company's business are
likely to have attempted the burglary,
and he is now searching for the men
who have been hanging about the of
fice of the company for several days.
Agent J. R. Hutlson has given the
names of the suspected men to the
Marshal, and believes they will be ap
prehended very soon. "If strange 1

this job," said Hudson this morning,
"they naturally would have sought to
force open a big steel safe which stood
conspicuously in the office, but which
contained nothing. That safe was
merely in storage. The burglars tackled
our 'wav' box, a big steel affair. 1
suppose they knew that we do a busi
ness of several hundred dollars a day,
and thought the morfey would be in the
box. They were- fooled. The box con
tained only $1.75, and the thieves didn't
get even that."
The express company's office resem
bled a wreck this morning when Agent
Hudson arrived. Boxes and packages
had been piled against the front door
to deaden the sound of the operations.
Packages had been opened and their
contents thrown about the room. The
way box' stood in the rear room, with
a hole drilled for an inch and a half
through the lock. Blankets had been
thrown over the box, it being the in
tention of the operators, apparently,
to use dynamite to blow the safe open,
and have the blankets deaden the
sound of the explosion.
Entrance to the place was made
through a small window in a closet
at the rear.
President J. N. Blaln of the express
company came over from San Francis
co this morning when informed* of the
occurrence here, and inspected the
premises, conferring with Marshal
Kerns regarding measures for the cap
ture of the cracksmen. The company
will not know the exact amount of its
loss until patrons report the non-ar
rival of packages which had been con
signed to them and were in storage at
the company's office. . .
ARTISTS NOW
LIONS OF THE
SOCIETY SET
By Zoc Green ltadcliffe.
OAKLAND, Dec. 6.â Not for years, If ever,
has society been so Interested In art and art
ist* as it seems to be at the present moment;
The smart set is going about seeking whom' it
may lionize, and the man or woman who ha*
done anything worth while in the world of
art or letters must pay the penalty of social
popularity. Not only does the writer find
himself developing unexpectedly into an.ora
tor on a small scale â f/Â»r the faddists must
hear their Idol's voice â but the artist's 'garret
is Invaded by these enthusiasts, and "studio
teas" are among the delightful social func
tions of the hour. Mrs. Guy Waterbury, when
she was Laura Prather, first started the fad
in Oakland, and the pleasant hours spent â¢ in
her studio will be long remembered by those
who were honored with an invitation. , Miss
Flora Bell, Mrs. Jack Hampton's sister, -who
has a cozy studio in San. Francisco, has also
frequently entertained, and Miss Emma Rob
erts Is another artist who is hostess at occa
sional delightful affairs.
Mrs. D. W. Gelwicks is planning an after
noon for the near future and her guests will
be given an opportunity, while sipping a cup
of tea. to view some of the clever sketches
made during the summer. Mrs. Gelwicks has
done a number of tiny pastel , landscapes â¢ that
are little gems.
Miss De Neale Morgan Is exhibiting a fine
collection of water colors at her home, 611
Nineteenth street. Yesterday afternoon a few
friends participated in a little Informal "tea."
Miss Morgan spent^the summer at Carmel-by
the-Sfa and she has perpetuated many charm
ing bits of that picturesque place. Nature in
her placid moods seems to appeal most to Miss
Morgan. The white pand dunes of Monterey,
a vista of dark oaks with the sunshine beyond,
a pale, peaceful sunset â all these and - more
has Miss Morgan caught with water color and
pastel. '
C. P. Nellson has just taken to his San
Francisco studio the bits of Old Mexico which
have been attraotlnK attention at Saake's Art
Gallery. There were many delightful- ; inte
riors and exteriors of historic Mexico,- partic
ularly a fascinating sketch of an old convent
window. He, has several paintings of old
adobe buildings that are exceptionally fine.
Few artists can put into their work the
poetry that distinguishes these sketches.'
To-morrow week, the 14th. the Oakland Club
will "mother" an exhibit of paintings by Mrs.
M. Fancber Pettls. Mrs. Pettis comes from
the north with a reputation that is: already
becoming familiar to us. and as the collection

The 1 Japanese Consul at : San Francisco was
to witness a flight ol my airship to-day, but
was disappointed when . I let him know that
the machine was undergoing repairs and that
I would not be prepared to make another trip
within a week or ten days. Several men,
claiming to represent tha Russian Government,
have also visited me, but as I am with the
Japanese In the preserit war I did not care to

COVER SCENE
OF SHOOTING
Policemen and Prosecuting
Attorney Leach Conduct a
Survey for the ICiniry Case
COLLECT MANY DETAILS
Express Confidence That the
Testimony Will Suffice to
Prove the Thug a Murderer
Oakland Offlc San Francisco Call.
1016 Broadway, Dec. 6.
In preparation for the preliminary
examination of David Klniry, burglar
and thug, on the charge of having
murdered Policeman James H. Smith,
a year ago, police officials have com
pleted their work of gathering and
collecting- the evidence which they
have in hand. The last step in ar
rangement of the testimony to be
presented ., was taken to-day when
Chief Hodgkins, Captain of Police W.
J. Petersen and Prosecuting Attorney
A. P. Leach made a critical examina
tion of the locality in which the shoot
ing occurred.
Leach and the police started from
Fourteenth and Jackson streets, and
covered all of the ground through
that part of the Lakeside district
down to Fourteenth and Oak, streets,
v/here- Goldstein, Kiniry's companion,
fell dead after He had fled from Smith,
who had shot him.
This tour of inspection was made
for the purpose of fixing carefully in
the minds of those who will prosecute
Kiniry the exact location of each of
the important points in the. scene. A
scaled diagram of the locality has
been made by the County Surveyor's
office to help the prosecution in pre
senting 1 its case.
I There is no doubt In the minds of
the police as to thein ability to pre
sent a flawless mass of evidence
against Kiniry. Every detail has been
covered with utmost care, because the
police realize that in the man charged
with the murder they hold an ex
ceptional prisoner. They are sat
isfied from the record Kiniry made fn
Los Angeles that he would do murder
without a second thought to gain Ud
erty or to escape arrest under any
circumstances. The police and Prose
cuting Attorney Leach are confident
that they will, present their fcase in
such a convincing shape that there
will be nothing left for surmise as to
his guilt.
To the end that not a point should
b*Â» overlooked the city has been
scoured for evidence. Many persons
have been Interviewed and, it Is said,
some important facts about the shoot-
Ing will be brought out at the trial.
The examination will be commenced
Thursday morning before Police
Judge George Samuels. Kiniry has
made no move toward getting legal
help. He has said he will conduct his
own case at the preliminary hearing
and will depend upon the . State to
furnish him an attorney when the
trial shall be- held in the' Superior
Court. The' prosecution has no ques
tion that sufficient evidence will be
presented at the examination to war
rant the holding of Kiniry for. trial.
The prisoner is closely guarded and
is seen by no one except the jail of
ficers and policemen in touch with the
case.

CELEBRATION
Big Popular Demonstration
in Honor of the Becent
Pact With United States
TAFT ONE OF SPEAKERS
Assures His Hearers That
the Greatest Good Will
Exists Between Countries
PANAMA. Dec. 6.â A supplemental
agreement signed this morning be
tween Secretary Taft and President
Amador and Foreign Minister Guardia
provides that after December 13 no
cargoes can be landed at the canal
-ports except on presenting a Panama
consular invoice from the port of ship
ment.
The original plans for a popular
demonstration in the public square in
celebration of the ratification of the
agreement was carried out last night.
Secretary Taft made a speech, during
which he congratulated the republic
on selecting the distinguished physi
cian, Dr. Amador, for President, and a
leading lawyer and jurist as Vice Pres
ident, thus Indicating the desire of the
people that the civil authorities should
be superior to ihe military and that
the army should only be an instrument
for the support of the civil Govern
ment.
The Secretary criticized the order
which, he' said, he himself had issued.
putting In force the Dingley tariff bill
mi the canal zone and the isthmus as
Idling a mistake. Friction bÂ«tween the
t wo govemmtnts was undoubtedly
< aused by that order. It was fair to
say that the order was made against
the recommendation of Governor Da
vis. He felt sure that a reading of the
agreement would satisfy every im
partial person that the United States
had no desire to acquire any power
or property in the Isthmus except that
necessary to build, maintain and pro
tect the canal.
Secretary Taft said the agreement
was or.s which had been reached be
cause both sides were desirous to
achieve results.
Pablo Aroaernena. the Liberal leader,
expressed satisfaction at the agree
ment, and added that it was gratifying
to the administration-
Fireworks, music and the distribu

HOW WHITEING
GOT HIS START
Author of "No. 5 John
Street" Tells of Early Ef
forts to Gain Recognition
LONDON LITERARY TALK
William Macdonald Putting
Finishing Touches on a
Biography of Franklin
LONDON. Dec. 6.â Richard White
ing has contributed to the pages of a
new London periodical an unusually
interesting account of how he got his
start as a writer. It is known, of
course, that the author of "Xo. 5 John
Street" first thought he would like to
be an engraver, but Whiteing has nev
er before told just how he proceeded
once he had made up his mind to be
come a writer instead. It seems that
h<v took long chances. He gave up his
calling, borrowed a ten-pound note,
took a front garret â only as a work
shop, however, for he still lived at
home â and began to lay siege to the
magazines.
j "My subjects." he says, "may best
be described by the title of thÂ» com
pendium â 'All About Everything.* The
editors were in no hurry. I assailed
them with great determination, but
my darts were caught in the meshes
of the wastepaper basket. According
to my own test, I ought to have
stopped there, and to have gone back
to the old calling, which was now
as irksome to me as work in the
mines. But, of course, when you are
in the thick of a fight you soon forget
the niceties of its science.
COURTKD IHJPULAR FAVOR.
"So, by way of forcing an opening,
I left off saying what I wanted to say,
and artfully offered one of them what
I thought he might want to have said.
It was most reprehensible, but I was
desperate now. I essayed a history of
clocks and watches for a well-known
local paper published in Clerkenwell.
I worked up the subject from an en
cyclopedia. .Everything was there, in
abstract, yet not a single thing had
a scrap of flavor in it. I took it down
to the office, and was so fortunate as
to find the person in authority behind
the counter. He weighed the manu
script â in his hand â and said that he
might publish it in two or three in
stallments. I was happy beyond words,
yet I lingered for a moment, without
having courage to say that I should
like to hear something on the question
I of remuneration.
" "You understand," he said, " 'that
we don't pay for things of this sort-'
"Certainly,' I gasped. It was not for
me to betray ignorance of a trade
secret."
AUTHOR'S FIRST HIT.
Whiteing made his first hit with an
unusually ingenious newspaper ar
ticle, suggested by James Greenwood's
"Night in a Workhouse. By an Ama
teur Casual," which the Pall Mall Ga
, zÂ» jtte was then publishing by install
i imnts.
"The. smartest of London evening
j papers," says Whiieing, "was sending
one of its smartest young men to pass
a night with the lowest poor, and to
tell us what it was like. The editor
j drove his man down in. a. broupham
j and dropped him in a careful assort
i ment of rags and tatters almost at the
workhouse door.
â¢' 'A good idea,' said a friend, 'but
I it would be a better one still to send
a rough among the swells, and let him
Let] his story.' "We both seemed to see
l:ght. and it was agreed that each
j should write his version of such an
jar tide, and that the better Â«ae should
be sent in the next day. I called on
j him in due course with mine done, but
i his was wanting, for the simple reason
that he had forgotten all about it. So
mine was dropped in the box. It was
copied out in a fair hand, it was even
! neatly bound in paper covers, for we
i were firmly persuaded that this was
| the way things should be done. This
i time the period of uncertainty was
phort and sharp. The next day the
'Evening Star' placards seemed to be
but one huge headline â 'Night in Bel
grave Square, by a Costermonger.' "
ADMIRER OF FRANKLIN.
William Macdonald, who used to be
one of that brilliant "National "Ob
server" gToup known as "W. E. Hen
ley's young men" â a group that includ
ed Stevenson, Kipling and Barrle â has
nearly finished an important work on
Benjamin Franklin, dealing principally
'with that sage as a citizen of the world
and a maker of international history.
Macdonald has been gathering mate
rial for the work for a long time and
is of the opinion that Franklin was the
greatest statesman of his day.

rHE SAN .FRANCISCO CALL. WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 7/ 1904.
CARTER STILL
DEFIES COURT
Governor of Hawaii Eefuses
to Obey Second Summons
to Appear Before Judge
DEFINES HIS POSITION
Says It Is Not Compatible
With Dignity of Office
to Recognize the Order
Special Dis:>atch to The Call
HONOLULU, Nov. 29.â Another stage
of the deadlock between Governor Car
ter and Judge Gear over the refusal of
the Governor to obey a subpena has
been passed. When Governor Carter
disregarded a second subpena Judge
Gear said the jury may be directed to
acquit the defendant.
The question at stake is, whether
Auditor J. H. Fisher is really Auditor
of the Territory,, as the Governor holds
his undated resignation. Judge Gear
decided that, Vthere being no doubt
that Mr. Fisher has been, and is now,
acting as a de facto officer of a de jure
office, his testimony should not be
stricken out, even if he does not hold
the office under a full and legal ap
pointment. The motion to strike cut
on the ground stated will therefore be
denied."
Setting forth his reasons for not an
swering the summons of the court, the
Governor wrote tcr Attorney General
Andrews, as follows:
In response to the Inclosed summons, served
on me this morning, to appear as a witness in
Judge Gcar> court, out of respect to this
court, a co-ordinate department of the Terri
tory, I desire you to appear In person on my
behalf and inform the court that I have mi
information which could possibly be of service
in connection with the case in question, and
do not believe it is compatible with the dig
nity of the office 1 hold to allow It to be
â¢ubjected to the orders of the court, as prompt
ed by the whims or opinions of attorneys. It
is the law that should be obeyed, not the law
yers.
The absence of the Secretary of the Territory
makes the demands on my time for the de
tails of this <if flee far In excess of what Is
usual, and in my opinion high public Interests
might suffer if I admitted that the courts
had a richt to command my attendance. Aj
yet I have never refused to attend voluntarily
and testify In any case where I have been con
sulted and my evidence Ehown to be necessary.

L.OXDOX, Dec. 6. â The Constanti

fore the court from time to time for
more than a year, has ended in an
order bv Sir Francis Jeune against
the wife to make her husband a

When Constantiniili obtained a di

of the late Stephen Ralli, a million

record damages of $125,000. The case
was also remarkable as being the only
instance where the . husband, who
himself admitted misconduct. had
obtained a divorce. .:.,. .
BERLIN SHOWS A HEAVY
DECREASE IX BIRTH RATE
Same Conditions Prevail in AH Large
Cities of the German Em- -
pi re.
BERLIN, Dec. 6. â Official statistics
covering twenty-six years show a
steady and noticeable* decrease in the
birth rate in the large cities in Ger
many, in spite of the fact that
the marriage rate is higher than in
cities of less than 100,000 inhabitants
and in the country.
Berlin, which passed the 2,000,000
mark in December, presents the
heaviest decrease in the birth rate. In
the period from 1S96 to 1900 it aver
aged 28.9, against 44.9 from 1875 to
1880. The highest birth rate is in the
great industrial centers of the Rhein
ish provinces.
Inverness May Be Floated.
LONDOX, Dec. 6. â The British
steamship Inverness, which went
ashore at Muroran while bound from
Tacoma for Yokohama and Hiogo,
haB become imbedded thirty inches in

charged. She is not leaking, and the
chances of floating her are favorable.
I American colony in London is attest-
I ed by the announcement 'of impending
publication of another directory devot
ed to Its members, entitled the "Amer

a list of Americans and American firms
doing business in Great Britain. It is
edited by Mrs. G. C. Bancroft, who, in
conjunction with Basil Bancroft, has
also established a new American Bu
reau in Regent street. It aims at pro
viding a sort of headcuarters for
American visitors and residents in
London and assisting them both in
business and social matters. As re
gards the latter Bancroft makes the
Interesting annoucement that the bu
reau "can supply x any American girls
â¢who are desirous of entering the elite
of British society with chaperones."
SARAH GRAND HEARD FROM.
Madame Sarah Grand has not been
heard from for some time, but she is
to the fore again with an essay in the
London "Boudoir." "Modern Un
graciousness" is her subject, and in
treating it Madame Sarah declares that
1 in her opinion the age of chivalry
j really has passed. She says the stand
ard of manners has been lowered all
over the world.
! "In Germany," continues this writer,
j "the Kaiser's men-machines take the
â  best part of the pavement 'from any
whom ther may safely elbow off; and
since the war there has been a lament
able falling off in France, that had
I the highest reputation for charm of
| manner up to the middle of thenine
l teenth century. . In fact," . says Sla
! dame Sarah, "French politeness has
, been degraded into an article, of com
i merce." â¢ â¢
It's rather' a pity that English news
paper .writers, who lie in wait for
j the chance to do so, get so many op
portunities to exult over slips on the
part of their American brethren. At
present, for instance, the London news.
; papers are having fun with the repre-
I sentative of a Boston newspaper, who
; came over here recently to Interview
several prominent English authors.
j This traveler wrote: "The most in
â  teresting writer I met in London was
, If r. G. K. Chesterton, author of The
â¢ Unspeakable Scot,' " and then proceeds
to give an interview he had with Ches
terton In which, as a. 'London weekly
drily remarks, "the latter is reported to
have kept up his anti- Scottish atti
tude v in a way that is surprising- con
sidering- th^t the real >â  autho> - of â ; the
'Unspeakable Scot' Is quite another
person."
Joan Baldwin
Scores Hit in
Piano Recital
(TALENTED PCPIL OF HUGO *
MANSFELDT. WHO GAVE PER
FORMANCE LAST NIGHT.
Miss Joan Baldwin at her recital at
Steiriway Hall last . night showed
much ability. Her programme was an
ambitious one and at the same time
lengthy. It comprised fourteen num
bers. The fair young pianist is pos
sessed of many qualifications that
should assist her, with patience and
practice, to reach a high place in the
ranks of professional musicians.
While Miss Baldwin Was pleasing in
all her numbers, the feature of the
evening was her really remarkable
rendition of the Rhapsodic Hongroise
No. i), "Carneval de Pesth," by Liszt.
Here her abilities showed at" their
best. The tender passages were given
with much delicacy, and feeling and in
the heavy portions of the composition
she exhibited unexpected strength and
powers of endurance. : She gave the'
diflicult Chopin numbers with much
appreciation of the composer's ideas.
The four selections by Albert I. Elkus
were little gems in their way and
were daintily interpreted. .
Miss Baldwin opened the concert
with selections Irom Schumann, but
was less at home in these than in the
other numbers. Perhaps she was a
trifle nervous. Hugo Mansfeldt should
certainly be proud of" his pupil.

America was devoted principally to
routine business. It is expected by
Thursday the routine work will be
completed and the convention will take
up the important matters that are to
come up before it. Changing conditions
make it necessary to revise some of
the laws of the International body.
A special committee, composed of
Delegates P. Scharrenberg, W. H. Jen
kins and Daniel Sullivan, was appoint
ed to devise ways and means of estab
lishing a home for aged and decrepit
seamen. Unusual interest Is taken in
this question.
An appeal from E. A. W. O'Dell of
the Boot and Shoe Workers' Union was
read, which earnestly requested the
seamen to recognize the stamp of this
union. A like request was heard from
Woodworkers' Union of America, ask
ing the seafaring men to recognise
their trade-mark. Both appeals were
favored by the body.
A , report from Daniel Sullivan, a
third vice president of the union, was
read, which treated of the condi
tions of the American seafaring man.
Another important resolution was
introduced by Delegate F. Scharren
berg, who urged the International body
to affiliate with the Transport Workers'
Union of America.
The Orpheum has been selected for
a theater party, to be given to the vis
iting delegates this evening.
Arrangements have been made for a
banquet Saturday evening at a down
town restaurant. A trolley ride has
been Manned for Sunday, to give the
visitors an opportunity to visit the in
teresting points of this city.
The grand rally, which is to be held
on Saturday evening at Sailors' Union
Hall, will be of interest to all seamen
in this port, and they are urgently re
quested to attend, as many important
topics will be discussed.

dered a most cordial reception by the
President. Mr. Roosevelt showed a
very intimate knowledge of New
Zealand's progressive legislation and
great natural beauties. -In the course
of their conversation Mr. Roosevelt
said:
I take a very great interest in N'ew Zealand.
It has done much to solve the problems re
specting labor; It. has gone much, further In
this direction- than any other country. It has
dealt with social questions in a very bold aijd
conclusive manner. "I have watched Its legis
lation very closely and with considerable inter
eat. In my opinion, it has gone on Found lines,
and I am very pleased to hear of the success
of its (if I may term it so) social legislation.
I cordially approve the granting of old age
pensions. There are many reputable persons
vho. from a variety of causes, cannot make
adequate provision for their old age. and it be.
hooves the state to assist In such cases. These
pensions should bo given as a rnaiter of right,
and not as charity. The world has a great
deal to learn from New Zealand. I am very
much interested In it and 1 am hoping to visit
it some day.

THE PRESIDENTIAL MESSAGE.
#
HP* HE President's vivid and virile message constitutes in its im
| mense scope and in its tone one of the most remarkable politi
cal pronouncements in the history of America. Nothing is
neglected, nothing i^ forgotten, and there can be very few who fail
to recognize that its author is, in the, deepest sense of the words,
President of the whole nation and not of a section only, and that
for him all mere party differences are submerged inÂ»the common
and united needs of the people. No sincere mind can approach such
a message as this without a quickening of the patriotic sentiment
which is as vitailv necessarv to-dav as it ever was.
It is characteristic of the President that he should step at
once into the arena where the much vexed labor problem has held
the stage for so long. His words are those of a strong and judicial
mind, knowing neither fear nor favor, and unerringly recognizing
and indicating the principles of right and wrong which underlie the
transient self interests involved.
The paternal note which is audible throughout the whole mes
sage is especially significant, springing, as it so obviously does, from
a transparent sincerity, a recognition of duty, and an unswerving
courage to perform that duty. The strong are to be encouraged in
their well doing, where such well doing exists, and the weak are to
be protected in their lawful self-defense. The distressing problems of
child labor, of child criminality and of child mortality must be
faced and solved, and there must be a recognition that the "sapping
of the vitality of those who are usually spoken of as the working
classes" can find no commercial justification whatever. A remedy
must be found for the destructive miseries of overcrowding, and
all other questions sink into "utter insignificance when compared
with the vital, the tremendous importance" of guaranteeing the
proper and natural development of domstic and family life. In his
care for the child and for the family the President shows himself to
be a statesman strong enough and wise enough to identify the needs
of the future with those of to-day, and his words will certainly call
forth a sympathetic and universal response.
The President's references to the broad public and commercial
questions of the day are necessarily condensed, but they are none
the less significant. The highways of commerce must be kept open
upon equal terms and "the rebate must be stopped." There must
be some general supervision over railway rate;s, and there must be
a policy of fair and open inquiry into the methods of "many im
portant corporations." The process of naturalization must be reg
uUted, the purity of elections insured, and the arm of the law must
be so strengthened and lengthened that it can reach those who sin
against the nation as well as those who sin against the individual.
The President's conception of liberty is a wide one, but it is not
wide enough to include the liberty to infringe upon the natural
rights of others.
Upon national needs the message is no less explicit and com
prehensive. American armaments must be 'sufficient for American
defense, and the "peace of tyrannous terror" must be shunned. There
must be eternal vigilance against external foes as well as against
those of our own household, and the merchant marine must be en
couraged by appropriate legislation.
Especially welcome are the Presidential references to the agri
cultural interests of California and of the country in general. The
immense irrigation work initiated by the reclamation act must be
carried on, and the forest reserves must be so handled that their
resources may be permanently useful. Encouragement must be
given to the Department of Agriculture with its almost limitless
researches into all the sciences of production.
Not least among the President's recommendations is that which
indicates the need .in every department of national life for courage,
good sense, kindliness and forbearance, a respect for the rights of
others and a sense of broad community of interest. In deep in
sight into national need, in wise and honest courage, the Presidential
message will leave its mark upon the political and social thought of
THE DEMAND FOR POETRY.
MR. BOYXTOX, who has written real literature into newspaper
work, declares that the people no longer buy poetry, and that
it finds an indifferent market. We beg*to suggest to Mr.
Boyhton that he get some one to write some poetry and test the
market with it. Poets and prophets appear at long intervals, and
their product has a permanent market. We think that Shakespeare's
works have an increasing market, and that the product of Tennyson,
Burns, Moore and Byron finds buyers. Among the moderns and
Americans, Joaquin Miller and Rudyard Kipling have a steady
vogue, and their best work does not fail of recognition. i
But perhaps Mr. Boynton means that rhymes do not repay the
cost of printing. That is probably true. Rhymesters we have al
ways with us, while poets appear occasionally and their work is
rare enough to be appreciated. Rhymes, more or less, are always
on the market and usually on the bargain counter: The public taste
is more critical. Even some of the hymns that used to be popular
are omitted from the modern books of sacred song, and tuneful
worshipers demand literature as well as pious passion in their
hymns. It is a reaction from the ragtime in both verse and melody,
that denotes refinement rather than decline in public taste.
â¢ The people want a poet for their money, and will pay when he
appears. We mean no offense to the many genial rhymesters who
mistake a burro for Pegasus. Their work is to poetry what the
foothills are to Olympus, and they are not always productive of
sadness, for they contribute to the gayeties of life by their well
meant efforts. Their work is upon us now like a cloud, which may
serve as a background for the lightning flash of real poetry which
comes unexpected and unheralded, for the thunder follows the
CRIME AND ITS CRITICS.
DR. COX AN DOYLE has contributed so much to the nation's
amusement and instruction that we may well listen patiently
to his monitions on the subject of crime in America. A total
of 32,000 lives lost through homicide within the space of three years
ought certainly to cause some reflection and amendment-
There will of course be nowhere any desire to minimize the
gravity of these^figures, although there may well be a recognition
of circumstances which do not exist elsewhere. Among these the
immense extent of territory must largely enter, as well as the fact
that immigration annually pours upon our shores a vast flood of
human beings for whose good behavior the country cannot become
at once responsible. Many of these new arrivals have never learned
the sanctity of human life, and crimes are thus often' transferred to
American calendars which ought Jmore justly to be debited else
where.
Lord Chief Justice Alverstone, upon the same occasion, paid
what was no more than a debt of justice when he said that Great
Britain had much to learn from America, and that Americans were
working hard to make their system not only humane but truly pre
ventive of crime.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 7, 1904.
ABSENT- MINDED
MARIA
BY CATHERINE BURGESS.
I
r would have been an injustice to
J Doctor Jardine and to his state_of
mind on a certain January evening:
in the year It-doesn't-matter-what
to say that he was in a bad tem
per. It was beyond thatâ a disgust
! with himself, the world and life so
consuming as to make his outward ac
tions almost automatic, so separate
were they from his inner self.
; Yet professional habit was strong.
1 The patients in the long wards saw
Doctor Jardlne watched her
amazed.
no difference as he stopped here and
there in his tour of inspection, and
asked the usual questions. Only one
young Irish girl, with the clearness
of death in her eyes, laid her hand
on his as he touched her tenderly, and
whispered, "You'd betther be comin"
wid me, docther, dear. Things'll be
straighterâ there."
It ; was not the first time he had
thought of it. Really, the inner voice
questioned, as he listened to the report
of the head nurse, what good was his
life to the world anyway? Here he
had gone half way across the conti
nent, this bitter January, to attend in
a great operation â and the man had
died, after all. He was not necessary
in the hospital, there were a dozen
better men; his wife â but he turned
from that thought instinctively; his sis
terâshe would forget he 'had lived or
died, at the sight of a Lafayette plate.
â the head nurse had finished her re
port. He looked at his desk piled with
mall.
"I can't read it to-night," he decided
aloud.
"The top one came yesterday by
messenger," the head nurse said. "It
la marked 'important,' " and she re
tired softly.
Doctor Jardlne broke the seal.
"Dear Brother," the note ran. "1
have heard of some extraordinary old
Staffordshire up in Ulster County, and
I start in ten minutes. Cornelia Frye
knows It, too, so you see there Is no
tome to lose. I may be back before
you return from the West, but in case
I do not, I enclose keys. We have
moved in your absence." (He smiled
at the "we.") "The new apartment is
19 East Eighty-fourth street. The Jan
itor of the old one was impertinent.
It is on the second floor, to the left.
Your room is at the end of the hall.
' "Your affectionate sister,
"MARIA."
The note was so characteristic, the
situation bo fitting a cllma^ to his
week of work and strain, that hl3
sense of humor was touched. "Per
fect," he murmured to himself as he
eent for a cab.
At 19 East Eighty-fourth street the
cabman had to work with voice and
hand to rouse his fare.
"I never knowed any gen'l'man so
far gone before three in the morn
ing." he observed to the area rail
ings.
Unconscious of the impression he
had left behind Doctor Jardine
stumbled up the front steps.
"Jardine, sir? Out, I believe, sir,"
said a sleepy hall boy.
"I know; I am Doctor Jardine."
The boy stared, succumbed to the
voice of authority and dozed again.
In the room at the end of the hall
the principal object of interest to the
weary man was the bed, a four-poster,
with curtains, surprising enough to
one who was used to sleeping on an
iron cot.
"Confound Maria!' he grumbled.
"II 1 she starts collecting antique fur
niture as well as plates I am lost!"
The four-poster wore a very Invit
ing air, despite Its unexpectedness.
Doctor Jardlne slowly pulled off his
shoes and divested himself of coat and
waistcoat.
! "I must lie down a moment," he
murmured, "and â think- â this â ever,"
and the bed received him into its
depths.
, He dreamed. A weird procession
passed before him like the figures In
a frieze â and every one was his wife!
Now she was laughing, now dancing:,
now weeping, now stern as the angel
outside paradise, always g~azlng at
him with unseeing eyes. He struggled
to reach her, but could not; he heard
her retreating: footsteps â retreating
yet sounding always nearer. Striving
to solve the puzzle, he awoke. The
footsteps continued, not loud and omi
nous as In his dream, but light, flit
ting stepsâ they -reminded him of
some one he had known. For' a mo
ment he stared bewildered Into the
darkness of the curtained bed, the
steps seeming to echo from his dream.
Then he remembered-^Maria . was in
Ulster County." "Who was the intruder?
Ho parted the curtains a finger's
breath and looked out. The room
beyond was dimly; lighted. Trunks
stood open, with books ; and clothing
in orderly piles beside them. The
clink of silver came from the room
across the hall.
"Looting the place, by Jove!" the
doctor whispered. He half arose, but
at the sound of returning BteDS he
sank back, his eye at the curtain part-
Ing. \
"Of all things in heaven and earth!"
Instead of leaDins out, he drew the
edges closer. "A woman!"
A woman it was who had entered the
adjoining room, and who proceeded,
with a business-like air, to store an
armful of silver in one of the yawning
trunks. Doctor Jardine watched her,
amazed. Her back was toward him,
and he noted its graceful lines, as she
lifted and bestowed her booty. She
looked a lady. Gradually he began to
feel like a peeping Tom rather than an
outraged householder. How should he
announce his presence? Would she
faint? What should he do with her?
What would Maria say?
At last she lifted the little shaded
lamp and turned straight toward him.
Not four feet from him she put the
lamp down and sighed, like a tired
child. He wondered afterward how he
lived through that moment. That she â
the woman he still loved, who bore hla
name, who had forsaken him â could
she have become a common thief? In
credible! It was a nightmare. The
curtains stifled him. He tore them
apart. The woman saw a pale, gasping
face fronting her, the eyes horror
struck as of one looking on a ghost. An
instant her own matched it, then she
fainted. '
"Molly!" he cried, and sprang to her.
She revived readily; he remembered
she had never been a fainting woman.
She clung to him.
"Robert," she whispered, "that hor
rible man!"
Then, watching his face, she let go
her hold.
"Robert! Were you he?"
He nodded, unable to speak.
"What did you do it for? It was
too dreadful! I thought it was a
burglar! How did you find me?"
"Find you? I opened my eyes and
Baw you!"
"Of course, but how did you know 1
was here?"
"What do you mean? How did you
know I was here?" he demanded.
"Are you trying to make a Joke of
it?" she cried. "You creep into my
rooms like a thiefâ"
"A thief!" he echoed. "Your rooms!
Aren't they mine? They knew my
name downstairs â "
"You are more ungenerous than I
could have expected," she Interrupted.
"Whose name could I bear but yours?
You are strangely forgetful!"
"No," he answered. "No, Molly, I
never forget If only I could! I shall
go mad some day, remembering."
Then, pulling himself together, "For
give this business, Molly. It's queer
enough, but it's some mistake of
Maria's. She has taken a new apart
ment, and â and, evidently this is not
it. I thought it was. Maybe I made
a mistake myself, I was dead tired.
Anyhow, I'll get out. I can go some
where, of course."
"It is hardly 'worth while," she re
plied. "It will, soon be morning, any
how. Jenny and I have been packing
all night, or rather I have, since she
fell asleep taking down pictures. We
sail to-morrow on the Oceanic."
He did not answer. The excitement
had faded from his face and left It
white and haggard. She came closer.
"Robert, I would never have gone
to you. I had injured you too much.
I know now It was my own fault â
my own Jealousy. But that does not
matter. We shall soon be separated,
perhaps forever. Fate â or God â has
brought us together for a moment
first. Forgive me!"
TÂ»o hours later there was a knock
at the door. Doctor Jardine and his
wife looked at each other with eyes
in which laughter and panic mingled.
"And you are a respectable widow,"
he mocked.
But it was only old Jenny who ap
peared upon the threshold. Her hands
and eyes' went up in happy gesticu
lation. /
"Thank the Lawd!" she cried, "the
two stubbornes* folks in the wo'ld
have done come together again! An'
Mis' Molly, the's a tel'phone fer the
doctah from the horspital. Mis' Jar
dlne's jest raisin' New Yawk because
he ain't come home, an' â
"But I have come home!" cried
Doctor Jardlne. "Where'B the tele
phone. Jinny?"
In a moment he returned, laughing.
"This is 19 East, isn't it?" he in
quired. "Well, my slsifir Maria 'jest
natcherly,' as Jinny would say, wrote
East when she meant West. I never
thought I should live to bless the ab
sent-mindedness of Maria, but heaven
knows I do now, with all my heart
and soul!"
And, though Molly was silent, she
felt for the first time that she truly
loved her sister-in-law.

THE PILGRIMS.
UPON the white sea-sand
There sat a pilgrim-band.
Telling the losses that their lives
had known,
While evening waned away
From breezy cliff and bay,
And the strong tides went out with
weary moan. ,
One spake, with quivering lip,
Of a fair-freighted ship,
"With all his household, to the deep gone
down;
And one had wilder woÂ«.
For a fair face long ago
Lost in the darker depths of a great
town.
There were who .mourned their youth
"With a most loving truth.
For its brave hopes and memories ever
green;
And one upon the west
Turned an eye that would not rest.
For far-off hills whereon his Joy had
been.
Some talked of vanished gold,
Some of proud honors told.
Some spake of friends that were their
trust no more;
And one of a green grave.
Beside a foreign wave,
That made him sit so lonely on the
shore.
But when their tales were done,
There spake among them one â
A. stranger, seeming from all sorrow
free â
"Sad losses have you met,
But mine Is heavier yet.
For a believing heart hath gone from
me."
"Alas!" these pilgrims said.
"For the living and the dead.
For fortune's cruelty and love's sure
cross.
For the wrecks of land and Sea! ,
But, howe'er it came to thee,
Thine, stranger. Is life's last and heav
iest loss!

DOORS TO FAIR FEMININITY
Eighth Exhibit of Members Work High Qlass
A fiun-colored catalogrue, emblazoned
â with a naughty-visaged owl, proclaims
to the populace that the "Eighth An
nual Exhibtlon of Paintings by the
Artist Members of the Bohemian Club"
is onâ beginning last night and lasting
until December 21. ;
Clearly the club inclines to be kind |
to women folk, for It opened its seduc- j
tive doors to femininity last night, giv- (
ing to it the freedom of the club â to j
such as were accompanied by members, j
And as further proof of the club's ten
derness to women the following an
nouncement Is maude: i
"The public (including ladies) will be
admitted to the Jinksroom (only),
â where the exhibition of pictures will be
held, upon presentation of cards issued I
by members, on Saturday, 10, Tuesday, j
December 13, Friday, December 16, and j
Wednesday, December 21, from 2 to 5 j
p. m., with last day closing with an ;
evening reception."
Now, all women love the mysteriousâ
the vague and unattainable. Therefore j
do they love to wander Into a man's
club. Just because there's a sort of
"forbidden fruit" fantasy about it. It's
out of the ordinary â hence appealing,
and the reason for the* smart crush of
last night.
Observation would divide the func
tion into two phases, the artistic and
the social, with the latter rather in
the lead.
But the pictures â not the crush, the
cupper, the pretty women, the gowns â
are what we were there for. And well
pleased was he â¢who went about the
jinksroom with his eyes, physical and
mental, alight, for there is a splendid
show of strength and beauty and poet
ry on the walls.
True, Peters, Matthews, McComas
and Welch are missing, but their fel
lows have "made good" as never be
fore â bo eay the artist folk, who real
ly ought to know. Among those whose
pictures and statuary appear are: II.

SOME OF THE PICTURES IN THE

HIBIT.
Interesting exhibit in the form of a
memorial has been arranged by New

1S87. /-â '-.
This remarkable ladâ he was but 20

the world. Versatile, humorous, seri

conception and of nervous dexterity,
he left behind him a wonderful amount
of clever work, and work that will out
live the generations whose follies he
Jeered and ridiculed in his own fan
tastic manner.
Taken all in all, the Bohemian Club

charity either within or without the

LOOSE IN PARK
Australian Quadruped Leaps
Barrier and Is Still on
the Jump When Last Seen
JELUDES THE POLICEMEN
Long-Legged Beast Outf oots
Horses of His Pursuers
and Scares Pedestrians
There was a new "Tale of the Kan
garoo" at the park last night. One
of the Australian natives jumped the
fence of his paddock and successfully
eluded the attempts of two mounted
policemen to capture him. At a late
hour this morning he was still Jump-
Ing, s
A pedestrian on McAllister street,
near Stanyan, about 9 o'clock last
night, was startled by an odd-looking
form sitting serenely on the park wall
at that point, calmly taking In the
surrounding landscape.
The glistening eyes of tha quadru
ped filled him with fear and he left
a trail of dust as he sped for the Park
Police Station.
Mounted Policemen Pidgeon and
Budd started after the escaped curio.
They found him still reclining on his
haunches at the northwest corner of
the park. Carefully they drove their
horses near the animal. Pldgeon
poised his lariat for a moment and
then threw it. The rope sailed square
for Mr. Kangaroo's head, but the wily
Australian, with a great leap, deftly
Jumped through the loop. With huge
bounds he started westward, the po
licemen after him. Like Mark Twain's
coybte, the curio did not seem to over
exert himself, but, after the fashion of
the desert scavenger, easily kept Just
out of reach of his pursuers.
The hunt lasted for two hours; the
kangaroo leading the mounted men a
merry chase up and down hill, around
trees and down embankments. Several
times Pidgeon and Budd attempted to
ensnare the beast, but always he elud
ed the lariat. )
After a long chase the animal seemed
to tire of being pursued and with a
few bounds left his would-be captors
alone In the trees of the park. Up to
a late hour no trace of the kangaroo
could be found.

Pressure for Appointments
of tKe Judges for Newly
Created Courts of Appeal
FIELD OF ASPIRANTS
Legislature Must Provide
Means for Payment of Kent
and Salaries of Attaches
The pressure for the Immediate ap
pointment of nine Judges for the new
Appellate Courts Is very strong:, but
there Is gossip to the effect that the
Governor refuses to be rushed. The fact
Is taken Into consideration that the
Legislature must provide means for
the payment of court expenses for the
last half of the present fiscal year, and
for the. succeeding two years. Apart
from the salaries of Judges, money
must be allowed for rent of court
rooms, the employment of clerks, sten
ographers and bailiffs.
The applicants for the favor of the
appointing power are legion. It la the
impression of leading lawyers that the
nine Judges will be taken from this
list of aspirants:
. FIRST DISTRICT.
Republicans â Ex-Judge Edwari Sweeney,
Shasta; Commissioner N. C. Chlpman, Tehama;
Judge Smith. Sierra; T. -I*"-* Carothers and
Judge Mannon, Mendocino; Judge Buckles, So
lano; W. W. Middlecoff. San Joaauln; Judge
Baxhom and Judge Dougherty, Sonoma, and
Judge Cooper, Humboldt.
Democrats â Judge MoLeughlln, Plumas;
JudgÂ« Rust, Amador.
SECOND DISTRICT.
Republicans â Commissioner Ralph C. Har
rison, Judge Carroll Cook and E. Tauzsky. San
Francisco; Judge Henry A. Melvin and Judge
S. P. Hall, Alameda; Qeorgre C. Roes. San
Mateo.
Democrats â Commissioner James A. Cooper,
San Francisco; Judge Clarke, Santa Clara.
THIRD DISTRICT.
Republicans â Victor E. Shaw, San Diego;
Commissioner W. A. Gray, Tulare; Judge Oa
ter. Ban Bernardino: Judge Allen and Judge
York Los Angeles.
Democrats â Commissioner George Smith. J.
A. Anderson and Judge Track, Los Angeles;
Judge Short, Kings.
According to the constitutional
amendment recently adopted the Gov
ernor must appoint one of the Judges
in each of the three districts as the
presiding Judge.
It is gossip in court circles that Judge
Henry A. Melvin of Alameda and
Judge Edward Sweeney of Shasta are
so highly commended that they will
be appointed. It is said also that the
Governor desires to recognize the pres
ent Court Commissioners and views
with favor the Indorsements in behalf
of Colonel N. P. Chipman.
The forthcoming message to the Leg
islature is now demanding the atten
tion of the Governor, and he may deem
it advisable to defer the appointments
of Judges until means have been pro
vided for the maintenance of tho new
courts.

SCOTSMAN A WINNER
BY FRED E. SI ULHOLL.AXD.
Walter Jennings" smart filly Letola.
carrying 104 pounds and ridden by W.
DavisÂ«. took the six and a half furlong
handicap from Garnet Ferguson's colt
Military Man yesterday at Oakland.
The least speck of ill fortune during
the race would have landed her back
.â¢ notch.
There were half a dozen starters in
this event, with Letola a pronounced
favorite at 4 to 5. At the start Military
Man broke second, but as Helgesen's
ordrrs were to take his mount back he
was soon trailing: the field.
Th*; favorite raced Veuator and Sea
Voyage to a standstill, and was then
called on the stretch to withstand the
challenge of Military Man. which came
\s ith a great rush. Davis had neither
whip n^r wteels, and Letola. finishing
on h<?r own courage, won by a head.
There was considerable bumping the
last 100 yards, and Helgesen claimed a
foul. If the winner bore out some
EfelffCKn started the bumping, and the
numbers were not changed. Judge,
â with Michaels in the saddle, ran a
good third.
Xn better contested racing has been
BÂ»Â»en since the opening of the season,
nearly all of the finishes being close
and exciting. The fields were well bal
anced, and there is no paucity of rid
ing talent. son>e of the cleverest sad
dle artists in the country Deing ob
tainable. Favorites captured three
purses.
K.VAPP LANDS MOLTO FIRST.
On form Molto. from the stable of
H. L.. Shannon, looked best of the ten
maidens in the introductory event.
Hidden by Knapp and 6 to 1 In the
betting, the- gelding made all the run
ning, and, in a driving finish, beat the
12 to 1 shot Emma Reubold more than
a length. Mike Daly's Canonicus fin
ished third. Walter Jennings start
ed Isabutte 5n the race, and the filly
was Installed favorite. She displayed
Bome early speed and then faded away.
Scotsman, piloted by Harry Mi
chael?, earned a lucky victory in the
mile selling number, for which Colonel
Van had a decided call in the betting.
The Colonel was just about an hour
and forty minutes the best, but Frank
Sullivan, who rode him, broke it up in
grand style. Last almost until fhe
stretch \vaÂ« reached, he then waded
through tho bunch, only to be outfin
ished and nosed out at the wire. Meis
tersinger looked to have the show
cinched, when Sherwood brought Gold
finder up, beating the Henshall horse
a head. The going did not appear
heavy enough for Foxy Grandpa.
How much the best Sol Lichtenstein
was cf the big cluster of platers start
ing in the six-furlong selling scramble
will never be known. Sol ruled favorite
in the ring. Helgeson got him away
absolutely last. The blonde rider did
not despair, though, but went to work
and, by a liberal application of the
whip, finally collared the leader. Doc
tor Sherman, at the paddock, and in a
furious drive fairly lifted his mount In
first by a head.
HARD BURNS AS PACEMAKER.
Four lengths behind Doctor Sherman
came Mimo. Bard Burns cut out the
early pace, and had the track been
heavy would have been hard to catch.
Charley Henshall's clever youngster,
lÂ»elham, cleaned up in the 2-year-old
yurse event, for which he went to the
poFt an ll-to-10 favorite. There were
seven other starters, but the only one
to receive any amount of attention was
The Mist, and the filly failed to even
show. Kunz got Pelham off in front
and kept him there, reaching the wire
a length in advance of Davis' mount.
Sea Air. Yada. a 25-to-l sho-t, defeated
Hooligan for third place. McLaughlin
had The Mist down on the rail where
the footing was cuppy, which proved
too preat a handicap.
Jsabellita, the mount of Davis, got
mixed up in a bumping: match at the
start of the closing mile-and-flfty-yard
run, or the mare could scarcely have
lost. Neither Major Tenny nor Moco
lito, the two choices, ran inside of
the money. When MajOT Tenny blew
up on the stretch turn Minder hustled
The Fretter. a 15-to-l shot, into the
leading position, and in a mild drive
downed Bronze Win* more than a
length. Isabeillta finished a good third.
TRACK NOTES.
Helgesen made a remarkably strong
finish on Sol Lichtensteln. . The black
horse must have imagined he had run
afoul of a fireworks factory.
W. Davis was successful with but
one of his mounts. â;.""

A WINNER AT ASCOT PARK
Invictus Scores Over Brooks Course
LOS ANGELES, Dec. 6.â Three fa
vorites, two second choices and an out
sider in the betting: were the winners
to-day at Ascot. There was a big
crowd in attendance, the day being des
ignated "ladies' day.", Ed Walsh car
ried off the jockey honors, winning two
races, finishing second in one and third
in another. Fuller's ride on Tim Payne
in the second race did much to win
the race for his mount from Winni
freda, with Interlude third. The three
horses finished together, each under a
hard drive.
Ralph Reese won all the way in the
third race, El Otros managing to beat
Mart Gentry for the place by a small
margin. Elle was overlooked by the
big ,bettors in the fourth number, and
went to the post as good as 10 to 1. He
led all the way, winning from Judge
Denton and Flo Bob in the order
named by half a length. Golden Light
was the best in the fifth and won
easily from Needful and Helgerson. The
first race over the Brooks course, which
is seventy-three yards short of a mile
and a quarter, was the sixth on to
day's card. The course was named in
honor of Manager J. W. Brooks of As-
He Is no longer connected with the
Summers stable.
After his ride on Colonel Van
Frank Sullivan should have set him
self down for a week or two. He Is
certainly riding in poor form.
Charley - Henshall is reported to
have had a $5000 bet down on Pel
ham.
Sol Lichtenstein was claimed from
Peter Romigh in Portland by Jasper
Madison, the colored owner and ex-
Jockey. Romish got his sprinter
back yesterday by hiking the selling
price from $400 to $900.
Allen Avon, the useful two-year-old
owned by "Kansas" Price, is dead.
Del Fountain has a spanking good
two-year-old in Hooligan, and it

was unable to comply with her hus
band's demand that she make his race
horses break world's records she was
subjected to brutal treatment, and she
was accordingly granted a divorce at
Marshalltown to-day.
Her story, as told to the Judge, was
corroborated by two witnesses, who
are neighboring women. Mrs. Orr had
achieved considerable reputation as a
divine healer in Colorado, but has
never practiced her power much in
this State. It was shown to the satis
faction of the court that she suggest
ed to her husband that if she could
qnly have the influence over his horses
that she has over human beings she
could make them win every race In
which they were entered. He there
upon began to insist that she perform
this feat. She attempted it. but his
horses failed to win. He then abused
her and the divorce suit resulted.

FIVE KNOCKOUTS
ON THE LAST NIGHT
OF TOURNAMENT
BERGER'S OPPONENT MISSING
Intended Victim of the Cham
pion Avoids the Meeting.
The main event at the Olympic Club's
boxing tournament last night did not
take Dlace. One F. Smith, who was to
stand before the mighty Sam Berger,
evidently received a gypsy's warning
bomewhere! : He could not be found
with a search warrant. The announcer
darkly hinted that ihe chill evening at
mosphere had descended into the pedal
extremities of Mr. Smith, compelling
him to linjjei'b'y his own fireside with
his tootsies in a hot mustard high-batl.
As a substitute for the go Andy Gal
lagher and Sam Berger exhibited for
two rounds. The two champs were look
ing for other victims, but amateur
heavies hike to the woods when the
magic names of Berger and Gallagher,
are mentioned. " â  , ' . â¢ .
Kaufman, who pounded the head off
J. Walsh of the Hawthorn Club,
looked as though he might be able to
entertain . Berger for a tew minutes.
Kaufman has a punch that lands with
the force of a mule's kick. Some day
he is going to give some of the ama
teur heavies a little run.
Only two of the bouts went the limit.
Roche and Carroll, the two babies,
broke about even. Dwyer and Berg
kept moving till the gong tapped. Berg
got his In the fourth round and was
tickled almost into hysterics when
the bell chimed. There was no dbubt
as to the results of the other bouts.
The slaughtered had to be carried
away.
E. Tuxedo Graney, the village black
smith, officiated as referee with his ac
customed grace and dignity. ,

BRITT IS IN STRICT TRAINING
Californian Is Settled in Quarters at the Beach
With a Strong Staff of Handlers.
Jimmy Britt. who has been taking
light exercise for some time in antici
pation of a match this month, has
finally plunged into the thickest of
training. He has settled down at the
Seal Rock House at the Ocean Beach
with his retinue of handlers and is
working earnestly.
He took a long run on the road yes
terday morning and after a rub down
plunged into the surf at the foot of the
Cliff House hill. Surf bathing is a new
feature in his .training and he enjoys
it hugely. He also went in the surf
in the afternoon.
In the afternoon he boxed with Char
ley Kreling and Frank Rafael before a
large gallery of visitors. Rafael helped
condition Nelson for his fight â with
Corbett, and if there are any weak
spots in the Dane's armor he will
coach Brltt how to reach them. The
Californian watched Nelson's rough
style closely when he fought Corbett
and has figured out how to offset his
terrible onslaughts. Without condition
SIX-DAY BICYCIJS RACE
IS A CEASELESS GRIND
Riders Arc Fnr Behind the Record
Established by McFnrland and
Elkes.
NEW YORK, Dec. 6.â The six-day
bicycle race at Madison Square Garden
to-day developed into a steady, cease
less grind. Worn by the exertion of
many hours, none of the riders seemed
anxious to set a "killing" pace, and
every hour placed the riders farther
behind the record established In previ
ous contests. The exciting sprints that
marked the earlier stages of the race
were almost entirely lacking during
the night and early hours to-day.
During the night there was only one
spill, and that only affected one rider,
Floyd Krebs, the tire of whose wheel
came off.
During the afternoon Willie Fenn
broke his own record for one-fifth of a
mile, going the distance in 20 1-5 sec
onds. The previous record was 21 4-5
seconds.
Frank Kramer was unsuccessful in
an attempt to break the world's record
for one-quarter of a mile held by him
self, but rode the distance in the rec
ord, time of 24 4-5 seconds.
At 1 o'clock this morning the thir
teen leading: teams in the six-day race
had covered 900 miles. The four other
teams were one laD behind. The rec
ord for this time Is 9S5 miles three laps
made by Bikes and McFarland in 1900.

CORRIGAN MAY
OPEN TURF WAR
Master of Hawthorne Is
at Outs With Western
Jockey Club Officials
TROUBLE OVER DATES
New Circuit of Tracks May
Be Formed to Kun in Oppo
sition to Old Organizations
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CHICAGO. Dec. 6.â If all signs do
not fall, Edward Corrigan will begin
an extensive turf war against the
Western Jockey Club and the tracks
controlled by it.
As a result of Monday's meeting of
the Jockey Club's stewards, at which
dates were refused to the new New
Orleans track, headed by CorriRan. and
the Union Jockey Club at St. Louis, of
which P. J. Carmody Is manager, it Is
believed that Corrigan will form a new
circuit of tracks which will run in od
position to those governed by the West
ern Jockey Club. In this circuit it is
believed would be Hawthorne. Elm
ridge of Kansas City. New Orleans
track. Latonla, Essex Park Club at
Hot Springs, Ark., and possibly Nash
ville. Some even go far enough to
predict that in case of a war Washine
ton Park and Worth might Join the
new circuit.
FIGHT IS OX IX ST. LOUIS.
Union Jockey Club Officials Announce
a ],ons Season.
ST. LOUIS, Mo., Dec. 6.â As a re
sult of the Western Jockey Club's re
fusal of dates to the Union and Pan
ama tracks of St. Louis and New Or
leans a disastrous turf war seems In
evitable. In Missouri the effect may
be to break up the game with an en
tire new deal In the State government.
There is a strong probability that if
the enemies of the syndicates which for
several years have monopolized sport
In St. Louis, made a strong, intelli
gent fight in the Legislature the syn
dicate's monopoly would be broken uo
by the repeal of the breeders' law. un
der which racing at any one track
more than ninety days in the year is
forbidden. The Cella-Adler-Tilles svn
dicate evades thl3 law by owning three
tracks and splitting their dates.
The Union Jockey Club officials threw
down the gauntlet to-day to the "West
ern Jockey Club when they announced
they would race six months next sea
son. This means a test of the breeders'
law and a despe'rate flcht.
XEYV ORLEANS OWNERS STUNNED
Stock In the New Track Is a Drag in
the Market.
NEW ORLEANS, Dec. 5.âStockhold
ers in the New Orleans Jockey Club are
sore to-day. They thought they had a
sure winner in the new track, and the
action of the Western Jockey Club was
a great surprise to them. Stock
dropped rapidly. It Is on the madfcet
in bunches at almost any old price.
All the officers of the new track are
in Chicago, and until they return it
will be difficult to tell just what action
will be taken. The general . opinion
among men who know those most
largely interested In the new track is
that they will take their medicine and
wait for better luck next time. They
are all men who believe thoroughly in
legitimate racing and will run no
chances of their track belnjc put in the
outlaw class. There are a few horse
men here who believe that when the
new track is completed racing will bo
carried on for a large part of the
spring.
Shorter Season for Baseball.
CHICAGO. Dec. 6.â The annual meet-
Ing of the American Baseball League
will be held at the Auditorium Hotel
to-morrow. Little routine business will
be transacted. Before the meeting is
over it is said definite instructions will
have been given to the schedule com
mittee to draft a list calling for but
140 games instead of duplicating last
year's long schedule. The majority of
the magnates have expressed an ob
jection against last season's arrange
ment and will vote for a shorter
schedule.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN BERNARDINO. Dec. 6.â The
first wreck on the Salt Lake Desert

may cause two more. The wreck oc
curred near Barstow to-day. A tank
car, with Henry Rogers on. board, was
being hauled up one of the long grades.
The coupling pin broke and the car
dashed down the grade. Rogers tried
to set the brakes, but they proved in
effective and tte car ran for miles at
terrific speed. At siding 21, ten miles
from where the car broke loose, it
swept around a curve and 'ran into a
locomotive on which were Engineer J.
M. Henderson and Fireman F. U.
Miller. â 
The engine was standing still, and
the men in charge were taken com
pletely by surprise, and were caught
in the smash-up. Both car and engine
were totally wrecked. The Injured men
were placed on board a train and hur
ried to Daggett, Rogers dying on the
way. Henderson and Miller were taken
on the west-bound overland train to
Los Angeles, where it was found that
they are seriously injured.
Rogers* body was brought to this
city. He leaves a widow and family In
Reno, New He was a brakeman.

ulty. Professor Corey, president of the
stndents' affairs committee of the fac
ulty, was present, and said that this
could not be. The students' honor com
mittee then adopted a plan providing
for a students' affairs committee to be
composed of six members from the
student body, appointed by the asso
ciated students twice a year, this com
mittee to act as a court of first aDDeal.
In the case of misconduct on the Dart
of any student the students' affairs
committee of the student body will take
the matter up, and if the action of this
committee Is not satisfactory the fac
ulty committee will then handle the
case. It was originally intended that
the honor committee that met to-nisrht
would only cover the question of honor
in examinations, but the recent
trouble with Captain Nance made the
case take a broader ground, and by the
action of the students themselves it
now covers all conduct of students.
Plans will be adopted on Friday.
The members that met to-nisrht are:
J. P. Loeb. R. Lu McWilliam. R. Gab
bert. Earl D. White, Hugo Miller. L.
D. Bohnett, Miss Ann Thatcher. Miss
Nellie McCarthy and. Miss Flora
Frlckstad.

The Weather and Crops.
The meekly report of A. G. McAdie. section
-director cf the climate and crop aervtce of
the Weather Bureau, is as follows:
GENERAL SUMMARY.
The weather during the week was generally
clear and cool in all parts cf the State, with
Tegs in the eoa*t districts. Light rain fell
In nearly all sectic*s. Forests were frequent
- In Um central and northern., sectiou, Lut
â caused ~o carnage.
A lair* acreage of grain l-.as been sown in
the central and northern districts and plowing ]
and seeding are still in progress. Early. grain I
continues in excellent condition and is making
rapid growth. In the southern districts the
soil has tx^n too dry for profitable cultivation
and but little (rrzin has been planted. The '
recf-Et bho-A-ers in Southern California were too
Sight to be of material benefit. Green feed is
plentiful in all sections except the south, and
cattle ere in good condition. The corn crop
is all gathered.
hi ecial reports on the orange and lemon
crops have been received from the different
sections of the Stat*. The season has been
unusually favorable for these crops !n the Sac
ramento ani San Joaquin valleys and in the
*~!ovÂ»rT5ale <liÂ£tri<"t. but rather unfavorable in
.Hcutbern California. There have been no In- ]
jurious froets nor high winds to damage the
fruit or trees, but in the south the scarcity
of rain has had en injurious effect In nearly
all districts ar.d the crop will he considerably |
lesfc th?n last seasons. In the Porterville. ,
Oroville ard Clovcrdale districts the. oranges
are of excellent quality and the crop Is fully
up to average. Picking and shipping are in
jrogress Jn most places. Vineyard and orchard
prunlnr have commenced.
SACJUMEXT'i VA LLEY.â Generally clear
Â»rd cool weather prevailed during the we*k,
vith light fr<">stÂ«. which caused no damage.
JJcht r*ln !ell Wednesday and Thursday. The
â¢ea>on has been unusually favorable for citrus
truits. oranges liaving colored satlsfactotily
And lrtnon trees being heavily laden with ex
cellent fruit. No damage has been done to
â¦Ither cror by froÂ«t* or high winds. Orange
picking and thliTlng are progressing rabidly.
The yjÂ«>ld and quality are fully average. Grain
continues in good condition and Is making
rand growth. 'â¢ "lowing and heeding are pro
â *fret>in*. Tasturage Is abundant and of good
<iua!Jt> la all sections and cattle are In prime
coalmen.
COAST ANT) BAT SECTIONS.â Th* tem
perature was nearly nnrmaJ and the weather
k<nen.l!y clear during the week, with fogs In
the" ccurt rfisiricts and light to heavy frosts
In raany places. L>lght shower* fell In nearly
all districts and were very twn<-flcial in the
â couth. Killing frost occurred at 1'eachland on
.the 3d but caused no damage. A Urge acre
age cf irrain has been sown in the central
and northern sections and about the usual
â¢acreage will be planted in the south. Much
of the c â .:â .. Is up and making rapid growth.
with indications of a large crop. Plowing and
mr~&\r.g continue. Pasturage Is plentiful In
Â»<ost pis'-** ari cattle, are la good onditlon.
*IÂ» rc:n rroj- hc*< aM been harvested. Oranges
â¢t CloÂ«u'jile f.n 1 Peachland are coloring and
.vilj soon bÂ» ready for picking; the outlook is
rood for a large crop. The olive crop at Clo
â¢verdale !s unusually large. Pruning has com
tat*rv4 In vineyards and - orchards.
FAN JOAQCIX VAJ.LKT.â Cool and parti*
rloudy weather prevailed durir.g the pa*t
Â« - Â«^k. .with rwcasional fogs in the morning.
Ucht fenst* were reported from some sec- i
tlonÂ«. tri caused no damage. Plowing and
t-t+Glni: â  Â«er.tinue In the northern portion of |
the valley where the ground is in fairly good
condition to work, but In the central and
ftfnithem portion* it is most too dry for farm-
Ing operations. Rain Is badly needed In all
eections. Gr^en feed and early sown grain are
looking fairly good. Feed is plentiful and
stock are hraSthy and in good condition. Large
shipment!: of orange* and lemons continue to
Eartern markets. The oranges are particularly
rood this* season; of large sire, excellent
quality and very ripe for this time of the
year. Irrigation water is plentiful.
P'irTIIKRS CALIFORNIA.â The weather
was- cooler than during the preceding week
and, partly cloudy toward the close, with light
rain in snac K-r'.ion*. The rainfall at La
;â '-â â * on tlv 2d was .::<5 of an Inch and was
the first since October fl. Oranre and lemon
Richards art showing the lack of moisture and
Irrigation water is becoming low.'. In the On-
T*rio district it is reported:/ "Orange pack
ing of holiday fruit Is in progress; the quality I
nf the fruit is v<ry good, but the crop is esti
mated Â£* less than last year." A correspond
ent, at Covina reports; "Oranges show the
j-r^d of moisture. The crop will bÂ» about
half of that Of last season. No oranges are I
Â»i<*'.;n: â¦Juj-j^ed for holiday trade." At San '
Ij'.pco and Anah/Im orange* arÂ» coloring I
slowly, vlxtnons are reported in fair condition
Very little farm work is being done owing to
the drvness of the soil and pasturage has al
most f*ilÂ«l.
. LOS- ANGELES SUMM ART.â Oranges are

New York Stock Market.
NEW YORK. I>ec. (5.â Individual stocks
made volatile advance* to-day, but they were
of a character less Impressive to stock mar
ket 6*ntl:nent than some of those that have
shot up in tl'e recent past. There were also
fewer cf them. The Instability of other recent
favorites at the altitude to which they have
i teen forced clso caused wrnw 1 suspicion of
I theÂ«c movements which culminated In the vio
lent bre&ck in prices at the last. Speculators
whj have bourht stocks recently in the hope
that they would hit up the one that was to
enjoy the next movement of this description
or those who have ho;wd that the whole mar
ket would be carried along by sympathy with
the strength of specialties Â»re beginning to
reflect their disaiipointmetit by seeking; to sell
out. The general level of the market has
been refD^r.sive to tbe advancing tendencies
for several dayÂ« past and the steady proflt
taking at different points throughout the. list
haÂ« caused the fear that a reaction is at
hand. News of Â«reneral conditions does not
offer en explanation for a decline in stocks
â  except for the reason that prices may have
b**n sushed higher than was warranted by
actual improvement in conditions. There was
some remaining disquiet this morning over
newly resumed gold exports, but the easier
tone of money, both for call and time loans
made solicitude on this subject seem mis
placed. No borrower* seem disposed to take
!ra:.sÂ» at present rates except for short pe
riods and thÂ« avÂ»rage rate for call loans to
day f*ll to 3>i per cent. Sterling exchange
was firmer here and lower In Berlin while
the price of gold advanced In London, but
the export of gold Is regarded as a transaction
ur.irfluenced by exchange.
Ther* was a disposition among the traders
to ascribe the dull and nealected state of
the market tr> a Jf sire to await the â¢ Presi
dent's message. Tne hour after the mesnage
appeared was the strongest period of the day's
market and resulted In a fairly comprehen
sive advance to above last night 1 * level in the
standard stocks which had hung back up to
that time.
It was after an interval of hesitation that
the market broke to the extreme, low level.,
which was modified only by the scramble ' of
room shorts to take profits, causing sudden ral
lies.' This scramble of shorts gave rise to the
j supposition that .the break was due to a con
certed raid, especially on Amalgamated Ccp-
I per In which tbe. attack was tru/nDeted â  by
: advance advertising. " Others attached ira-
I portance to the discussion which arcae of
I the President's recommendation of authority to
j the Interstate Commerce Commission to fix
; railroad rates, although Â»rae such suggestion
| has come from the railroads themselves, a*
the only means to do away with the anti
trust law provision against agreement on rates.
By others It was inferred that the studied
ignoring of the subject of the tarifT In the
message was to be accepted as an Intimation
of a special message on the subject and a
probable adveracy of a revUlon. >

CHICAGO BOARD OF TRADE.
Future Grain and. Provisions.
CHICAGO. Dec. 6.â A practical denial of
yesterday's sensational report of damage to
the wheat crop in Argentina caused an easy
opening In wheat here. May was oft %c to
%c at ?1 13 to fl 18 W. Those who doubted
the authenticity of yesterday's damago reports
received much encouragement from the com
parative weakness of the wheat market at
Liverpool, where prices were j barely steady,
notwlthstandlns the 2c advance here the pre
vious day. On the initial break short* covered
quite freely and there was fair buying by. the
prominent bull interests. As a result May ad
vanced to $1 13 V4. Persistent selling of pit
traders, however, soon caused another decline,
which carried llay down to $1 12%. Toward
the middle of the session sentiment became
decidedly bullish and the market advanced
sharily. May selling up to $1 14. One cause
of the rally was. a partial â¢ conflrmayon by a
well-known British crop statistician of the
poor crops of Argentina. Another factor part
ly responsible for the upturn was & material
decrease in the world's available stocks â a
decrease of 2,024. (KX) bushels, compared with
an Increase of f>93.(X>0 bushels, the correspond
ing time a year ago. Small primary receipts
also gave additional impetus | to the advance
in prices. Late in the day the market became
weak on liberal proflt taking. Final quota
tions on May were at $1 13%.
The corn market was under strong selling
pressure throughout the entire day. May
ojrened a shade to H@'-4C lower at 449; (jj!
44*Â£c. and sold off to 44*gc, closing at 44?Â£@
44%c.
Liquidation of the December delivers â¢ by
.commission houses was a feature of to-day's
trading in oats. May opened unchanged to a
shade lower at 30*;iS30%e, pold down to 30%c
and' clo.-.ed at the low point. Local receipts
were 138 cars.
Provisions were weak as a result of liberal
receipts of hoes at the yards. At the close
May pork was off 17%f?2oc; ribs were 5<g7%c
lower, and lard was off 6c 'tci"$7 10. ' ~:

Butter, Cheese and Eers.
Stocks of Butter have now got down to a
point where they are no longer troublesome,
and most of the trade report a steady feeling
In consequence, though there Is no Improve
ment In prices. Only a very few dealers now
find their stocks Inconveniently large, and the
demand for fresh goods is better, as consum
ers are coming back to them In preference to
cold storage and Kastern goods, as already
mentioned.
. Cheese Is coming In more freely, as stated
yesterday, and the feeling Is easy In conse
quence. . ;
Esres are being affected by the continued ;
cold weather. Receipts are lighter than for
some time and as the demand Is good the '
market rules steady at unchanged prices.
Receipts were 23,000 lbs Butter, 444 cases
Eebs and 12.000 lbs Cheese.

Deciduous ami Citrus Fruits.
Aside from some narrow fluctuations In â 
rrioes of Berries and Grapes, there is nothing
new to report In fresh fruits, quotations for all
other descriptions being unchanged. Stocks of :
Apples and Oranges are excessive and ara be- â¢
Ing added to daily. and nearly all dealers are :
trying to effect clearances by cutting prices. ;
Oranges are moving slowly, as most cf the of- ;
ferings are lacking In color and the top quota- j
tlon Is obtained only for small lots of well i
known brands of fancy stock. $1 75 being an
extreme price for the general run of offerings. !
.All other Citrus fruits are weak, although '.
th*re has been no actual decline In prices, i
Receipts of Berries and Grapes ara mostly :
poor, and t}s deliveries of the latter are Irregu- |
lar it Is impossible for dealers to clean up from Â»
day to day. Pears and Persimmons are In j
light; b'lt ample supply, and prices are without j
change.

SCENE OF WILD GAYETY
Passing of Kestaurant Be
calls Days of Kevelry When
It Was in Its Prime
The Maison Tortoni, for over thirty
years, a resort for merrv gatherings
and midnight revelry, will soon be ojily
a memory, for to-morrow the strident
tones of the auctioneer's voice will
sound in the rooms where once noth
ing but reckless mirth was heard. The
rich furnishings of the resort will be
knocked down to the highest bidders.
The carpets over which once dainti
ly slippered feet trod lightly will be
torn up and sold â perhaps to a board
ing-house. The pianos that *,Jlngled
gay ditties from midnight lo dawn
may go to quiet homes. The heavy mir
rors that reflected brilliant lights and
the passing beauty of the women who
used to frequent the place will go â who
knows where?
If those furnishings could speak they
could tell tales of the pace that kills,
tales of reckless prodigality. But all
who know are as dumb as these inani
mate things. The proprietors of Tor
toni's always kept the secrets of their
patrons.
In the davs of the mining stock ex
citement Tortonl's stood fod wine, wom
en and sons in San Francisco. Then
the resort was at the height of its pros
perity. But prosperity of the kind that
visited Tortoni's Is short lived and the
maison was crowded out bv younger
competitors. The glamour of the name,
however, helped to keep it up â now
even that must pass. The gaudy fur
nishings will be scattered far and wide
and the glittering lights will never
again lure any one along the "prim
rose path."
The license of the last proprietor. S.
Constantini, was revoked by the Po
lice Commissioners on- complaint of
M. P. Scott of the Cooks* and "Waiters'
Union. Two waiters, both giving the
name of Peterson, gathered evidence
that made the board take that step.
It meant the end of Tortoni's. Tor
toni's \fllhout wine could not exist, so
Constantini was forced to sell out.

TAKES THE OATH IN COURT
BY JAMES C. CRAWFORD.
Mrs. Albert McKinnon, a buxom
housewife, accused of cruelty to her
two-year-old chjld, warmly resented
her husband's opinion that she was
Indissolubly wedded to the cud that
Inebriates. If she did imbibe ar
dent snlrlts once In a while it was
with reluctance, as she had no craving
for sucrt stimulants, and drank them
for medicinal purposes only. As for
noglecting her babe, how her spouse
could stand there and swear to such
a thing without fear of being stricken
dumb was more than she could under-
stand, although she had been taught
by bitter experience that he would not
allow moral scruple to stand between
him and the attainment of his de
sire, which in this case was her in
carceration, for reasons well known
to her, but which she would keep to
herself with a view of averting scan
dal. â¢ â¢ ...
"That's not true, Judge," said Mr.
McKinnon, a middle-aged artisan
with careworn countenance. "I don't
want to have her sent to Jail, but I
would like to have her compelled to
swear that she will stop drinking.
When sober she's a good wife and
mother."
"We can fix that right here," said
his Honor Cabaniss, "provided the
lady prefers voluntary abstinence In
freedom to enforced sobriety In
prison. If it is true, as she states,
that the drink habit has not hopeless
ly enslaved her. she can file no rea
sonable objection to making oath that
she will abjure the use of intoxicants
for a given period."
Mrs. McKinnon promptly accepted
the semi-challenge and Clerk Barney
Conlan was instructed to administer
the oath. With due solemnity he re
quested her to hold up her right hand
and repeat the pledge he was about to
dictate. She obeyed his instruction
most tractably until he said "for a
period of one calendar year from this
date," when her hand suddenly de
scended and she sharply demanded
what he meant by that.
"To swear you off for a year," the
clerk explained. "**
"Not much!" vociferated the lady.
"What do you take, me for? Why
don't you try to make it a century?
The i-dee-ah!" .
With folded arms she stood and
turned deaf ear 1 to both suasion and
Intimidation from Judge, clerk and
husband. She would .rather spend
the remainder of her earthly tenure
behind prison bars, she asserted, than
accede to' the proposed unnecessarily
protracted deprivation of ''malt or
spiritous liquor. Not that she be
lieved herself incapable of living up
to such a covenant â no, Indeed â but
she would never, submit. to -have her
good nature so grossly -imposed upon.
Then the Judge, by way of compro
mise, suggested that the term be re
duced to six months, but the sugges
tion was waved aside with a derisive
hand. . â¢
"Don't you think," she asked, "that
if I worried through three months
without taking a .drink I would be
pretty .jwell ; weaned?"
So three months rwas the period
agreed on, and the lady qualified her
acquiescence by informing the : court
that she wouldn't swear off for one
minute if she hadn't become tired of
the proceedings.
"Don't^ 'urt me character, yer wa
shup," said Henry Mathieson, steward
of the British ship Linton, when Judge
Mogan asked him what he meant by
displaying a large revolver in a Bar
bary Coast dance-hall and thus creat
ing great agitation among the femi
nine habitues thereof. "Wot I means
by that 'ere remark, sir," he continued,
"is that I 'ates f, be jugged, 'cause I
never 'ave bin scragged â in fac',' this
'ere is my first happearance before a
beak. This 'ere bobby can tell] yer
washup that I hoff ered no resistance
w'en he nailed me. Please don't ''urt
me character, sir!"
' "What did you carry a deadly wea
pon forâ to kill- somebody?" the bench
inquired.
"Bless yer 'art, . no, sir. Me . maties
'inted that it would be a wise pre
caution to harm meself afore going
ashore, 'cause there was lots o' 'lgh
waymen halong th' docks. I didn't
hlntend t' 'arm hobuddy, yer washup,
an* ye can talke me word for It."
His word was taken.. ,
â  â¢ ' â¢ â¢;â â â 'â¢
! Manager Ed Ackerman of the Cali
fornia Theater told Judge Conlan that
the newspaper photographer who was
battered by Comedian Charles Dox of
"The Runaways", company had ob
tained his (Mr. A.'s) permission to go
behind the scenes | and . investigate the
j reported attempted suicide of Miss
I Daisy Dale, soubrette. Prior to the
I photographer's arrival, .Mr. Ackerman
i added, a physician had examined Miss
! Dale and declared her swoon was not
I genuine. -
."What's that?" Inquired the Judge.
"The doctor said Mie was shamming,"
replied the manager.
"Ho, ho!" Quqth'. the, Judge,., "that
puts a new aspect on ; the case, â¢; and I
must continue it; for further^ investiga
tion. We'll have Miss Dale here, also
{ the physician â  who . opined she <was
j shamming, and â¢ then '. we may be : better
I able to declderwhether.it; Is Justifiable
! for.' an actor to assault a newspaper
man. who is permitted to go behind the
scenes to obtain the details of a re
ported attempt at suicide."
. The stage manager of "The Runa
ways" told the Judge that Miss Dale
had been much given to fainting spells,
and that for some unexplained reason
he had handed her a two weeks' no
tice to quit. His Honor was not visibly
impressed by the information.
Miss Lillian Stanley, actress, con
fessed to Judge Fritz that she lost her
temper^ arid did induce In fisticuffs
with several feminine habitues of an
O'Farrell street music-hall. But her
act waa~not unprovoked, Miss Stanley
added, as she had been "Joshed" and
"picked, on" by the other ladies until
a saint on earth could not have forbore
doing what she did. Her husband, an
actor, was employed in the music-hall,
she explained, and for reasons which
she did not consider it necessary, to
state, but which probably were obvi
ous, she deemed it proper to await his
dismissal for the night and accompany
him home. She was thus engaged, an,d
saying nothing to anybody, when sev
eral women at an adjoining table be
gan discussing her wifely devotion,
which they ascribed to Jealousy on her
part, and their remarks were appar
ently intended for her hearing. . She
stood the twitting Just as long as her
temper could bear up under the strain,
and then â well, her husband separated
the .combatants.
Case dismissed.
A tardy echo of the Jockeys' ball
wafted into Department No. 1, where
John Mason and Kittie, his wife, were
accused of disturbing the peace of the
200 block on Powell street at, 6 o'clock
last Sunday morning. They were en
gaged in fierce conflict when Patrol
man W. Kavanagh intrepidly dashed
into their apartment and stopped hos
tilities by arresting them. /
The primal cause of the infelicity.
as explained to Judge Mogan, was
Kittie's irrepressible desire to attend i
the jockeys' ball and John's resolute
opposing attitude. Not only did he
decline to escort her to the great terp
sichorean function, but also objected ;
to her proposed enlistment of a mu- !
tual masculine friend to serve In that
capacityi and informed her that if she i
attempted to go unprotected he would
"loosen her slats." But she went
It was 5 o' th* clock when Kittle,
fatigued but fearless, tripped into her
boudoir, and John at once proceeded
to fulfill his threat of slat loosening.
Kittie, however, failed to accept the
promised penalty of her disobedience
with expected supineness. As her
spouse aimed his first kick she adroit
ly sidestepped, deftly picked up an
alarm clock and hurled it at his head.
He ducked and. the missile flew wide.
Then she clinched and hung on while
he vainly endeavored to deliver the
delayed kick, and both of them were
doing some nifty short arm punching
when the policeman, attracted by the
screams of affrighted female neigh
bors, stepped In anfi tore them asun
der. - '
"I didn't go to the dance Just be
cause I wanted to go to the dance,"
said Kittle to Judge, Mogan, "but just
to show him that- he couldn't bluff me
Into staying at home." j
John's promise to abstain from fu
ture . enforcement of his demands by
applying his feet resulted in dismissal
of the case.
Joseph Ellenbok'a face 'â 7 or as
much of it as was visible â bore un
mistakable signs ,of recent and severe
pummellng. His eyes were environed
by mounds of . purple flesh, â  his nose
was lopsided .and his mouth awry,
bandages concealing. the remainder of
his visage. Yet he stood. before Judge
CabanLss a defendant, the charge be
ing assault with a deadly weaoon, to
wit, one knife, with which he punc
tured a leg belonging to Charles Can
ning, blacksmith of 215 Tehama street,
while the twain were engaged In acri
monious discussion of a -future sport
ing event. It was Mr. Canning's
gnarled fists that effected the decora
tion of Mr. Ellenbok's countenance,
and the Judge's opinion that the .de
fendant had been amply punished for
his 'knife play was supplemented with
an O. R. order.

MISS JOLLIFFE
WINS THE DAY
Lawyer Johnson Vanquished
by a Bright Eetort From
Charming Society Belle
CALL MANY WITNESSES
Railroad Agent Is Sure Miss
Dolbeer/Was Sane on the
Horning Before Fatality
In the' Dolbeer will, case yesterday
there was an Interesting contest ' of
wits.. Miss Virginia Jolliffe flashed her
pretty black eyes in vexation as Hiram
Johnson plied questions in cross-exam
ination, but the next moment there
would be dimpling smiles, for the suave
attorney would quickly relent when he
saw that he gave annoyance. A face
tious or pleasing turn to his queries
would quickly restore good cheer. Aside
from Miss Jolliffe's experience on the
stand there was nothing in the pro
ceedings to arouse Interest.
The young society woman â  was a
strong witness for the proponent. She
had known Miss Dolbeer intimately for
several years, and ,was with her in
Paris the few weeks preceding her
death In New York. The witness swore
that Miss Dolbeer was at all times in
normal frame of mind and free of the
suspicion of "melancholia.
While the testatrix participated in
the many diversions offered by the gay
city, she complained that she was not
enjoying herself as much as she had
expected, for the reason that she had
no gentleman friend to escort her to
all the places she would like to visit.
However, Miss Dolbeer was in good
spirits and cheerfully, entered into the
gayeties wherever she went. Sh*e suf
fered from a^cold, but otherwise had
no ailment, so far as the witness knew.
"You say that Miss Dolbeer was a
strong girl, and that there was little
possibility that anything could tire,
her?" asked Johnson toward the end
of his protracted cross-examination,
and in a tone that bordered on sar
casm.
"Oh, yes, there are things that would
tire her," and Miss Jolllfie's eyes shot
a merry glance at the lawyer.
The answer came so sweetly and so
brightly that Johnson soon excused
Miss Jolllffe from the cross-examina
tion that she thought would weary even
Hercules.
W. H. Mangels, a salesman at
Shreve's, testified that on April 23, the
day the testatrix made her will, she
bought a sliver dish from him that
was sent to Miss Wilson of Berkeley.
The witness was positive Miss Dolbeer
was sane that day.
G. M. Koeppel and P. W. Morehouse,
employed in a local railroad office, told
of the sale to Miss Dolbeer and Miss
Warren of tickets to New York. The
witnesses noticed nothing unusual
about the testatrix.
Mrs. Horace Blanchard Chase, who
was an Intimate social acquaintance,
also expressed the opinion that Miss
Dolbeer was of sound mind.

Charles Nelson, John A. Hooper, Hugh

PRESIDENT'S FUTURE POLICY IS REVEALED
TO CONGRESS IN A STRONG MESSAGE
JUST treatment for all citizens, with special privileges for none, in the administration of the laws; a firm foreign policy, combined with advocacy of the principle of arbitration
to promote the world's peace; the upbuilding of the navy and merchant marine, the one to safeguard the Monroe doctrine, the other to carry American commerce to the
remotest portions of the globe; fair dealing with territories and dependencies; the reclamation of the, arid lands of the West; restraint of immigration to the extent of
excluding undesirable aliens; greater uniformity in the criminal laws of the Statesâ these are some of* the important features of the policy of President Roosevelt as outlined in
his message to Congress. No mention is, made of tariff revision. Currency reform is suggested; the President recommending that the Senate and the House join in an inquiry
to determine what changes would be most beneficial. â¢ J \
Document Recommends Much Legislation
for the Nation's Betterment.
PRINCIPAL POINTS OF THE MESSAGE:
CAPITAL â Great corporations should be managed with due regard to the public interest as a whole. Where this can be done un
der the present laws, it must be done. Where these laws fall short, others should be enacted to supplement them.
LABOR â The wage workers have the right to organize and by all peaceful means to endeavor to persuade their fellows to join
them in organizations. They have under no circumstances the right to commit violence upon those, whether capitalists or
wage workers, who refuse to support their organization, or who side with those with whom they are at odds; The Govern
ment can neither discriminate for nor against non-union meen who are in its employ. Where Government employes band them
selves together for the purpose of extorting improperly high? salaries from the Government they are guilty of a grave im
propriety.
REBATES â The highways of commerce must be open to all and it is necessary to put a stop to all rebates.
MODEL. CITY â Washington, the capital of the nation, should be made an example to other American municipalities by enact
ing and enforcing needed laws for the District of Columbia. .
AGRICULTURE â Two thousand specialists in the employ of this department of the Government are making research into all
the sciences of production. Marked "benefits to the tillers of the soil has resulted. ~
IRRIGATION â Plans for the larger problems for the reclamation of arid lands have been solved, and it now remains, to execute
r-OTvicTTT a D^crrDfnrr ai c ? U .* , .. . . ... . . . . .;. ... .v . 4 4 .
t/CJlMtjULAR SERVICE â Salaries should be substituted for fees. A competitive system of examination for appointments is
NATIONAL QUARANTINE LAW â It is undesirable that a State should, on its own initiative, enforce quarantine regula
tions which are a restraint upon interstate commerce.
CURRENCY â Retirement of the greenbacks is urged. Every silver dollar should be made by law redeemable in gold at the
MERCHANT MARINE â Immediate attention is called to the need of encouraging American shipping by appropriate legis-
IMMIGRATION â We should not admit masses of men whose standards of living and whose personal customs are such that :
they tend to lower the level of the'Arnerican wage worker. --â  â * â :-.-. - â -,./:. 'â â¢'â â  â â '::" '-%â  â '-.â¢ -^W^v s-';~-~^5]fÂ£c~ : >.'^'. â -;;â {?
PROTECTION OF ELECTIONS â The enactment of a law directed against bribery and. corruption is recommended.
CRIMINAL PROSECUTIONS â A system of procedure has grown up in the Federal courts which- makes the law. easy of en
forcement against the man who has no money and difficult of enforcement against the man who has money.. In criminal cases ;
the writ of the United States should run throughout its borders. The wheels of justice should not* be: clogged.
FOREIGN POLICY â American rights will be safeguarded at all times. The United States is an earnest advocate of the policy
of arbitration. iK-'S . f

THE PHILIPPINESâ At present the island tribes are utterly incapable of existing in independence. They must be helped
to rise in the higher scale of civilization and the capacity for self-government.
CALL, BUREAU. HOTEE.
BARTON, WASHINGTON.
Dec. 6.â The full text of
President Roosevelt's mes
sage to Congress follows:
To the Senate and House of Rep
resentativesâThe nation continues to
enjoy noteworthy prosperity. Such
prosperity is of coarse primarily due to
the high individual average of our cit
izenship, taken together with our great
natural resources; but an important
factor therein is the working of our
long-continued governmental policies.
The people have emphatically express
ed their approval of the principles un
derlying these policies, and their de
sire that these principles be kept sub
stantially unchanged, although of
course applied in a progressive spirit
to meet changing conditions.
The enlargement of scope of the func
tions of the National Government re
quired by our development as a nation
involves, of course, increase of expense:
and the period of prosperity through
which the country is passing justifies
expenditures for permanent Improve
ments far greater than would be wise
in hard times. Battleships and forts,
public buildings and improved water
vays are investments which should be
made when we have the money; but
abundant revenues and a large surplus
always invite extravagance and con
stant care should be taken to guard
against unnecessary increase of the or
dinary expenses of government- The
cost of doing Government business
should be regulated with the same rigid
scrutiny as the cost of doing a private
business.
Capital and Labor
Have Equal Rights
Federal Government Should Set
Example io the States in En
forcing the Lckv.
In the vast and complicated mech
anism of our modern civilized life the
dominant note is the note of Industrial
ism; and the relations -of capital and
labor, and especially of organized cap
ital and organized labor, to each other
and to the public at large come second
fn importance only to the intimate ques
tions of family life. Our peculiar form
of government, with its sharp division
of authority between the nation and the
several States, has been on^the whole
far more advantageous to our develop
ment than a more strongly centralized
government. But it is undoubtedly re
sponsible for much of the difficulty
of meeting: with adequate legislation
the new problem* presented by > the to
tal change in industrial conditions on
this continent during the last half cen-
tury. In actual practice It has. proved
exceedingly difficult, and in many cases
impossible, to get unanimity of wise
action among the various States on
these Fubjects. From the very nature
of the case this is especially true of
th*Â» laws affecting the employment of
capital in huze masses.
With regard to labor the problem Is
no less important, but It is simpler.
As long as the States retain the pri
marv control of the police power the
circumstances must be altogether ex
treme which require interference by the
Federal authorities, whether in the way
of safeguarding the rights of labor or
in the way of seeing that wrong is not
done by unruly persons who shield
themselves behind the name of labor.
If there is resistance to the Federal
courts, interference with the malls, or
interstate commerce, or molestation of
Federal property, or If the State au
thorities in some crisis which they are
unable to face call for help, then the
Federal Government may interfere; but
though such Interference may be
caused by a condition of things aris
ing out of trouble connected with some
question of labor, the interference itself
simply takes the form of restoring or
der without regard to the questions
which have caused the breach of order
â for to keep order is a primary duty
and in a time of disorder and violence
all other questions sink into abeyance
until order has been restored. In the
District of Columbia and in the Terri
tories the Federal law covers the entire
field of government, but the labor ques
tion is only acute In populous centers
of commerce, manufacturing or mining.
Nevertheless, both In the enactment
and In the enforcement of law the Fed
eral Government within its restricted
sphere should set an example to the
State governments, especially In a mat
ter so vital as this affecting labor. I
believe that under modern industrial
conditions it is often necessary, and
even where not necessary it is yet often
wise, that there should be organization
of labor In order better to secure the
rights of the individual wage worker.
All encouragement should be given to
any such organization, so long as it is
conducted with a due and decent re
gard for the rights of - others. There
are in this country some labor unions
which have habitually, and other labor
unions which have often, been among
the most effective agents In working
for good citizenship and for uplifting
the condition of those whose welfare
should be closest to our hearts. But
when any labor union seeks improper
ends, or seeks to achieve proper ends
by Improper means, . all good citizens
and more especially all honorable pub
lic servants -must oppose the wrong
doing as resolutely as they would op
pose the wrpngdoing of any great cor
poration. Of course any violence;; bru
tality or corruption should not! for one
moment . be tolerated. ' Wage-workers
have an entire ' right to 'organize and
by all peaceful and honorable means to
tndeavor to persuade their, fellows â¢ to
Join with them in organizations. .: They
have a legal right, which, according to
circumstances, may > or . may r not be â  a
moral right, to refuse to work in com-

pany with men who decline to Join
their organizations. They have under
no circumstances the right to commit
violence upon those, whether capitalists
or wage-workers, who refuse to support
their organizations, or who side with
those with whom they are at odds; for
mob rule is intolerable In. any form.
EMPLOYERS' LIABILITY.
Employes of the Government
Should Be Safeguarded.
I The wage-workers are peculiarly en
titled to the protection and the encour
agement of the law. From the .very, na
ture of their occupation railroad men,
for instance, are liable to be maimed
an doing the legitimate work of their
profession, unless the railroad compa
nies are required by law to make ample
provision for their safety. The admin
istration has been zealous in enforcing
the existing law for this purpose. That
law should be amended and strength
ened. Wherever the National Govern
ment has power there should be a strin
gent employer's liability law/which
should apply to the; Government itself
where the Government is an employer
of labor.
In my message to the Fifty-seventh
Congress, at its second session, I urged
the passage of an employer's liability
la;v for the District of Columbia. I now
renew that recommendation, and fur
ther recommend that the Congress ap
point, a commission to make a com
prehensive study of employer's liabil
ity with the view of extending the pro
visions of a great and constitutional
law to all employments within the scope
of Federal power.
MEDALS'OF HONOR.
Acts of Conspicuous Bravery
Ought to Be Rewarded.
The Government has recognized hero
ism upon the water, and bestows medals
of honor upon * those, persons who by
extreme and heroic darinc have endan
gered their lives in savins or endeavor
ing to save lives from , the perils of
the sea in â¢ the waters over which the
United States has Jurisdiction, or upon
an American vesseLr . This â¢ recognition
should be extended to cover cases of
conspicuous â¢ bravery ; and \, self-sacrifice
in the saving of life in private I employ
ments under, 1 the jurisdiction of :the
United States, . and particularly in 'â¢ the
land commerce. of; the nation.
TOO MANY ACCIDENTS.
Casualty List UpomRailroads
Matter of Public Concern.:
. The ever-increasing casualty, list up
on our ' railroads â¢ is a matter ? of ; grave
public concern, and urgently calls for
action by the Congress. In the matter
of speed and comfort of railway travel
our railroads give at least as good
service as those of any other nation,
and there is no reason why this. serv-t
ice should not also be as safe as human
Ingenuity can make it. Many of our
leading roads have been foremost in
the adoption of the most approved safe
guards for >, the , protection of travelers
and employes, yet the list of. clearly
avoidable accidents continues unduly
large. The passage of a law requir
ing the adoption of a signal sys
tem has been proposed to the Congress.
I earnestly concur in that recommenda
tion, and would also point out to the
Congress the urgent nerd of legislation
in the interest of the public safety lim
iting the hours of labor for railroad em
ployes in train service upon railroads
engaged in interstate commerce, and
providing that only trained and expe
rienced persons be employed in posi
tions of responsibility connected with
the operation of trains. Of course noth
ing can ever prevent accidents caused
by human weakness or misconduct;
and there should be drastic punish
ment for any railroad employe, whether
officer or, man, "who by Issuance of
wrong orders or by disobedience ' of or
ders causes disaster. The law of 1901;
requiring interstate railroads to make
monthly reports of all accidents to pas
sengers and employes on duty,' should
also be amended so as to empower the
Government to make a personal Inves
tigation, through proper officers, of all
accidents : Involving loss of life which
seem to require investigation, with a
requirement that â¢ the results of such
Investigation be made public.
The safety : appliance law, as amend
ed by the act of March 2. 1903, has
proved beneficial to railway employes*
and In order that its provisions may be
properly carried ' out, the force of in
spectors provided for .by appropriation
should be largely increased. This serv
ice is analogous *to : the Steamboat In
spection Service, and deals with J even
more important interests. It has pass
ed the experimental stage and demon
strated its utility, and should receive
generous recognition * by the- Congress.
FEDERAL "OPEN SHOP"
Non-Union Men Cannot â  Be
'Discriminated Against.
.There is no objection to employes ; of
the; Government i forming â¢ or belongin s
to : unions ; but / the ; Government can
neither discriminate for , nor. discrim
inate against" non-union men who are in
its "employment, or . who seek 1 to j be em

VELT. WHO HOLDS ALL MEN
EQUAL UNDER THE LAW. j
But their payment must be obtained by
arguing: their claims fairly and honor
ably before the Congress, and- not by
banding together for. the defeat of those
Congressmen who refuse to give prom
ises which they cannot in conscience
give. The administration - has already
taken steps to prevent and ;â  punish
abuses of this nature; but it will be
wise for the Congress to supplement
this action by legislation.
BUREAU OF LABOR.
Requiring Early Solution.
Much can be done by the Govern
ment In labor- matters merely by giving
publicity to certain conditions. The
Bureau of Labor has done excellent
work of this kind in many different
directions. I shall shortly lay before
you In a special message the" full re
port of the investigation 'of the Bureau
of ? ; Labor into the Colorado mining
strike, as this Is a strike in which cer
tain very evil forces, which are more or
less at work everywhereunder the con
ditions of modern industrialism, be
came startllngly prominent. It is great
ly, to â  be wished that the, Department of
Commerce and Labor,; through the La
bor Bureau, should compile and arrange
fcr;* the Congress a list of the labor
laws of ; the various States, and should
be ; given the \ means to investigate and
report , to : the Congress upon the labor
conditions in the- manufacturing and
mining regions throughout the country,
b?th asito .wages, as to hours of labor,
as to the labor of women and children,
and as to the effect in the various labor
centers of immigration from abroad. In
this - investigation . especial . attention
should be paid to the conditions of child
labor and child labor legislation "in the
several j States.^ Such an investigation
must ; necessarily take . Into account
many.,of -the problems with which;thls
question of "child labor : Is .. connected;
These problems can be actually. met. In
most , cases, ,â¢ only by the States them
selves; .-but;, the lack of 'proper legis
lation z in one State , in such : a matter
as â¢ child ; labor of ten renders it exces
sively, difficult to establish 'protective
restriction upon the â  work In another
State, having,; the " same > industries, so
that' the i worst: tends to drag down Ithe
better. 0 For: this reason It would be well
for 'the -nation at ; least to : endeavor: to
secure 5 comprehensive ; information * as
to" the Vconditions of. '.labor of ; children
initbe different States. Such investiga
tion and publication - by the / National
Government would tend toward the se-
curing of approximately uniform legis
lation of the proper character among
the several States. -
Laws to Regulate
Great Corporations
Elimination of Present Abuses
One' Duty of the Washing
ton Government.
When we come to deal with great
corporations the need for the Govern
ment to act â  directly . 13 far ' greater
than in Â« the case of labor, because
great corporations can , become such
only by engaging in interstate com
merce, and interstate commerce Is
peculiarly the field of the General
Government. It is an absurdity to ex
pect to eliminate the abuses in great
corporations by State action. It is dif
ficult'to" be patient with an argument
that such matters should be left to
the States, because more than one
State*: -pursues the policy of creating
on easy terms corporations which are
never " operated within that State at
all, but In other States whose laws they
ignore. The National Government
alone can deal adequately with these
great^ corporations*. To try. â¢ to deal
with 'them, in an intemperate, destruc
tive or demagogic spirit would, in all
probability, 'mean that nothing what
ever would be accomplished, and. with
absolute certainty.' that vif anything
were accomplished It would be' of a
harmful } nature. The> American peo
ple need : to : continue : to ; show - the very
qualities -that they have shown-r-that

desire to avoid doing any damage,' and
yet the quiet determination. to proceed.

step by step, without bait and without
hurry, in eliminating or at least in
minimizing whatever of mischief or of
evil â¢ there Is to Interstate commerce
in the conduct of great corporations.
They are acting in no spirit of hos
tility to wealth, either individual or
corporate. They are not against the
rich man any more than against the
poor man. On the contrary, they are
friendly alike toward rich man and
toward poor man. provided only that
each acts In a spirit of Justice and
decency, toward his fellows. Great cor
porations are necessary, and only men
of great and singular mental power can
manage such corporations successfully,
and such men must have great re
wards. But these corporations should
be managed with due regard to the
interest of the public as a whole.
"Where this can be done under the pres
ent laws it must be done. Where these
laws come short others should be en
acted to supplement them.
Yet we must never forget the deter
mining factor In every kind of work.
of head or, hand, must be the man's
own good sense, courage and kindliness.
More important than any legislation is
the gradual growth of a feeling of re
sponsibility and forbearance among
capitalists and wage- workers alike; *
feeling of respect on the part of each
man for the rights of others; a feeling
of bread community of interest, not
merely of capitalists among themselves,
and of wage-workers among them
selves, but of capitalists and wage
workers In their relations to each other,
and of both In their relation to their
fellows who- with them make up the
body politic. There are many captains
of Industry, many labor leaders, who
realize this. A recent speech by the
president at- one of our great railroad
systems to the employes of that system
contains sound common sense. It runs
In part as follows:
"It is my-belief we can better serve
each other, better understand the man
as well as his business, when meeting
face to face, exchanging views, and
realizing from personal . contact we
serve but one interest, that of our
mutual prosperity.
"Serious misunderstandings cannot
occur where personal good will exists
and opportunity for personal explana
tion Is present.
"In 'my early business life. I had ex
perience with men of affairs of a char
acter to'make me desire to avoid creat
inc a *lik$- feeling of desentment to my
self and the Interests in my charge,
should fortune ever place me In au
thority, and I am sdicitou3 of a meas
ure of confidence on the part of the
public and -our employes that I shall
hope may be warranted by the fair
ness and good fellowship I intend shall
prevail in our relationship.

due to the personal traits of arbitrary,

tion to withhold what is due, to force
by main strength or inactivity a result
not justified, depending upon the weak

have created a sentiment harmful in

sider anything fair that gives gain to

"If corporations are to continue to
do the world's work, as they are best
fitted to, these qualities in their rep
resentatives that have resulted in the
present prejudice against them must
be relegated to the background. The
corporations must come out into the
open and see and be seen. They must
take the public into their confidence
and ask for what they want, and no
more, and be prepared to explain satis
factorily what advantage will accrue
to the public if they are given their
desires; for they are permitted to exist
not that they may make money solely,
but that they may effectively serve
those from whom they derive their
power.

on the Beef Industry.
The Bureau of Corporations has made
careful preliminary investigation of
many important corporations. It will
make a special report on the beef in
dustry.
The policy of the bureau is to accom
plish the purposes of its creation by
co-operation, not antagonism; by mak
ing constructive legislation, not de
structive prosecution, the immediate
object of its inquiries; by conservative
investigation of law and fact, and by
refusal to issue incomplete and hence
necessarily inaccurate reports. Its pol
icy being thus one of open inquiry into,
and not attack upon, business, the
bureau has been able to gain not only
the confidence, but better still, the co
operation of men engaged in legitimate
business.
The bureau offers to the Congress the
means of getting: at the cost of produc
tion of our various great staples of
commerce.
Of necessity the careful investigation
of special corporations will afford the
Commissioner knowledge of certain
business facts, the publication of which
might be an improper infringement of
private rights. The method of making
public the results of these investiga
tions affords, under the law, a means
for the protection of private rights.
The Congress w ill have all facts except
such as would pive to another corpo
ration information which would Injure
the legitimate business of a competitor
and destroy the-incentive for individual
superiority and thrift. \
The bureau has also made exhaustive
examinations into the legal condition
under which corporate business is car
ried on in the various States; into all
Judicial decisions on the subject; and
into the various systems of corporate
taxation in use. I call special atten
tion to the report of the chief of the
bureau; and 1 earnestly ask that the
Congress carefully consider the report
and recommendations of the Commis
eioner on this subject-
The business of Insurance vitally
affects the great mass of the people of
the United States and is national and
not local in its application. It involves
a multitude of transactions among the
people of the different States and be
tween American companies and foreign
Governments. I urge that the Congress
carefully consider whether the power
of the Bureau of Corporations cannot
constitutionally be extended to cover
interstate transactions in insurance.
QUESTION OF REBATES.
Abuse of Carrier Privileges
Must Be Checked.
Above all else, we must strive to
keep the highways of commerce open
to all on equal terms; and to do this
Jt is necessary t^ put a complete stop
to all rebates. "Whether the shipper
or the railroad is to blame makes no
difference; the rebate must be stopped,
th* abuses of the private car and pri
vate terminal-track and Â«!de-track sys
tems must be stopped, and the legisla
tion of the Fifty-eighth Congress which
declares it to be unlawful for any per
son or corporation to offer, grant, give
ftollcit. accept or receive any rebate,
concession or discrimination in respect
of the transportation of any property
in interstate or foreign commerce
whereby such property shall by any
device whatever be transported at a
Jess rate than that named in the tariffs
published by the carrier must be en
forced. For some time after the enact
ment of the act to regulate commerce
it remained a mooted question whether
that act conferred upon the Interstate
Commerce Commission the power, after
It had found a challenged rate to be
unreasonable, to declare what there
after should, prima facie, be the rea
sonable maximum rate for the trans-*
portation in dispute. The Supreme
Court finally resolved that question in
the negative, so that aÂ« the law now
stands the commission simply possess
the bare power to dem/unce a partlcu
â¢ .I ate as unrea *onable- While I am
of the opinion that at present it would
,. e K? dc *i ral ? Ie ' lf lt * cr * noi imprac
.i t b!e : Â« n Â»Â» y <Â° clothe the.commis
sion with genera] authority to fix rail-
road rates, I do believe that, as a fair
security to shippers, the commission
should be vested with the power, where
a given rate has been challenged and
after full hearing found to be unrea
sonable, to decide, subject to judicial
review, what shall be a reasonable
rate to take its place; the ruling- of the
commission to take effect immediately,
and to obtain unless and until it is
reversed by the court of review. The
Government must in increasing degree
supervise and regulate the workings of
the railways engaged in interstate com
merce; and such increased supervision
is the only alternative to an increase
of the present evils on the one hand
or a still more radical policy on the
other. In my judgment the most im
portant legislative act now needed as
regards the regulation of corporations
is this* act to confer on the Interstate
Commerce Commission the power to
revise rates and regulations, the re
vised rate to a' once go into effect,
and to stay in effect unless and until
the court of review reverses it.
Steamship companies engaged in
interstate commerce and protected in
our coastwise trade should be held to
a strict observance of the interstate
commerce act.
â¦
Capital of Nat ion to
Be a Model City
District of Columbia Legislation
Should Seme as an
Example.
In pursuing the set plan to make the
city of Washington an example to other
American municipalities several points
should be kept in mind by the legisla
tors. In the first place, the people of
this country should clearly understand
that no amount of industrial pros
perity, and above all no leadership in
international industrial competition,
can in any way atone for the sapping
of rtie vitality of those who are usually
spoken of as the working classes. The
farmers, the mechanics, the skilled and
unskilled laborers, the small shop keep
ers, make up the bulk of the population
of any country; and upon their well
being, generation after generation, the
well-being of the country and the race
depends. * Rapid development in wealth
and industrial leadership is a good
thinj, but only if it goes hand in hand
with improvement, and not deteriora
tion, physical and moral. The over
crowding of cities and the draining of
country districts are unhealthy and
even dangerous symptoms in our
modern life. We should not permit
overcrowding in cities. In certain
European cities it is provided by law
that the population of towns shall not
be allowed to exceed a very limited
density for a given area, so that the
Increase in density must be continually
pushed back Into a broad zone around
the center of the town, this zone hav
ing great avenues or parks within it.
The death-rate statistics show a ter
rible increase in mortality, and espe
cially In infant mortality, in over
crowded tenements. The poorest
families in tenement houses live in
one room, and it appear that,, in
these one-room tenements the aver
age death-rate for a number of
given cities at home and abroad is
about twice what it is in a two-room
tenement, four times what It Is in a
three-room tenement, and eight times
what it is in a tenement consisting of
four rooms or over. These figures vary
somewhat for different cities, but they
approximate In each city those given
above; and in all cases the increase of
mortality, and especially of infant mor
tality, with the decrease In the number
of rooms used by the family and with
the consequent overcrowding is start
ling. The slum , exacts a heavy total
of death from those who dwell therein;
and this is the case not merely in the
great crowded slums of high buildings
in New York and Chicago, but in the
alley slums of Washington. In Wash
ington people cannot afford to ignore
the harm that this causes. No Chris
tian and civilized community can af
ford to show a happy-go-lucky lack of
concern for the youth of to-day; for,
if so, the community will have to pay
a terrible penalty of financial burden
and social degradation in the to-mor
row. There should be severe child la
bor and factory inspection laws. It Is
very desirable that married women
should not work in factories. The prime
duty of the man is to work, to be the
breadwinner; the prime duty of the
woman is to be the mother, the house
wife. All questions of tariff and finance
sink into utter Insignificance when com
pared with the tremendous, the vital
importance of trying to shape condi
tions so that these two duties of the
man and of the woman can be fulfilled
under reasonably favorable circum
stances. If a race does not have plenty
of children, or if the children do not
gTow up, or if when they grow up they
are unhealthy In body and stunted 'or
vicious in mind, then that race is de
cadent and no heaping up of wealth,
no splendor or- momentary material
prosperity, can avail in any degree as
offsets.
The Congress has the same power of
legislation for the District of Colum
bia which the State Legislatures have
for the various States. The problems
incident to our highly complex modern
Industrial civilization, with its mani
fold and perplexing tendencies both for
good and for "evil, are far less sharply
accentuated in the city of Washington
than in most other cities. For this
very reason it is easier to deal with
the various phases of these problems
in Wpjshington, and the District of Co
lumbia government should be a model
for the other municipal governments of
the nation, in all such matters as su
pervision of % the housing of the poor,
the creation of small parks in the dis
tricts inhabited by the poor, in laws
affecting labor, in laws providing, for
the taking care of the children, in
truant laws, and in providing schools.
In the vital matter of taking care of
children, much advantage could be
gained by a careful study of what has
been accomplished in such States as
Illinois and Colorado by the Juvenile
courts. The work of the Juvenile court
is really a work of character building.
It is now generally recognized that
young boys and young girls who go
wrong should not be treated as crim
inals, not even necessarily as needing
reformation, but rather as needing to
have their characters formed, and for
this end to have them tested and de
veloped by a system of probation. Much
admirable work has been done in many
of our commonwealths by earnest men
and women who. have made a special
study of the needs of those classes of
children which furnish the greatest
number of - : Juvenile offenders, and
therefore the greatest number of adult
offenders; and by their aid, and by
profiting by the experiences of the dif
ferent States and cities in' these mat
ters, it would be easy to provide a good
code for the District of Columbia.
Several considerations' suggest the
need for a systematic investigation
Into and improvement of housing con
ditions In' Washington. The hidden res
idential alleys are breeding grounds of
vice and disease, and should be opened
Into minor streets. ' For a number: of
years influential citizens have joined
with the district commissioners' In the
THE SAN FRANCISCO GALL, DECEMBER 7, 1904.
President's Attitude Toward Unions.
WAGE- WORKERS have an entire right to organize and by all peaceful and honorable
means to endeavor to persuade their fellows to join with them in organizations. They
have a legal right, which, according' to circumstances, may or may not be a moral right,
to refuse to work in company \v*ith men who decline to join their organizations. They have un
der no circumstances the right to commit violence upon those, whether capitalists or wage-work
ers, who refuse to support their organizations, or who side with those with whom they are at
odds; for mob rule is intolerable in- any form. * * * There is no objection to employes of
the Government forming or belonging to unions; but the Government can neither discriminate
for nor discriminate against non-union men who are in its employment, or who seek to be em
ployed under it. Moreover, it is a very grave impropriety for Government employes to band
themselves together for the purpose of extorting improperly high salaries from the Govern
ment. Especialy is this true of those within the classified service.
vain endeavor to secure laws permit;
ting the condemnation of insanitary
dwellings. The local death rates, espe
cially from preventable diseases, are so
unduly high as to suggest that the ex
ceptional wholesomeness of Washing
ton's better sections is offset by bad
conditions in her poorer neighborhoods.
A special "Commission on Housing and
Health Conditions in the National Cap
ital" would not only bring about the
reformation of existing evils, but would
also formulate an appropriate building
code to protect the city from mammoth
brick tenements and other evils which
threaten to develop here as they have
in other cities. That the nation's cap
ital should be made a model for other
municipalities is an ideal which ap
peals to all patriotic citizens every
where, and such a special commission
might map out and organize the city's
future development in lines of civic
social service, just as Major L'Enfant
and the recent Park Commission plan
ned the arrangement of her streets
and parks.
It Is mortifying to remember that
Washington has no compulsory school
attendance law and that careful in
quiries indicate the habitual absence
from school of some 20 per cent of all
chi'dren between the ages of 8 and 14.
It must be evident to all who consider
the problems of neglected child life or
th<Â» benefits of compulsory education in
other cities that one of the most urgent
needs of the national capital is a law
requiring the school attendance of all
children, this law to be enforced by
attendance agents directed by the
Board of Education.
Public playgrounds are necessary
means for the development of whole
some citizenship In modern cities. It
Is important that the work Inaugu
rated here through voluntary efforts
should be taken up and extended
through Congressional appropriation of
fund? sufficient to equip and maintain
numerous convenient small playgrounds
upon land which can be secured with
out purchase or rental. It is also de
sirable that small vacant places be pur
chase! and reserved as small park
playgrounda In densely settled sections
of the city which now have no public,
open spaces and are destined soon to be
built up solidly. All these needs should
be met immediately. To meet them
would entail expenses; but a corre
sponding savins: could be made by stop
ping the building of streets and leveling
of ground for largely specu
lative in outlying parts of the city.
â  There are- certafn 5 Offenders, whose
criminality takes the shape of bru
tality and cruelty toward the weak,
who need a special type of punishment.
The wife-beater, for example, is inade
quately punished by imprisonment; for
imprisonment may. often mean nothing:
to him, while It may cause hunger and
want to the wife and children who
have been the victims of his brutality.
Probably some form of corporal pun
ishment would be the most adequate
way of meeting this kind of crime.
Government Assists
Tiller of the Soil
Splendid Results Achieved by. the
Federal Department of
Agriculture.
The Department of Agriculture has
grown into an educational institution
with a faculty of 2000 specialists mak
ing research Into all the sciences of
production. The Congress appropriates,
directly and indirectly, $6,000,000 annu
ally to carry on this work. It reaches
every State and Territory in the Union
and the islands of the sea lately come
under our flag. Co-operation is had
with the State experiment stations, and
with many other Institutions and in
dividuals. The world 1st carefully
searched for new varieties of grains,
fruits, grasses, vegetables, trees and
shrubs, suitable to various localities
in our country; and marked benefit to
our producers has resulted.
The activities of our age in lines of
research have reached the tillers of the
soil and inspired them with ambition
to know more of the principles that
govern the forces of nature with which
they have to deal. Nearly half of the
people of this country devote their en
ergies to growing things from the soil.
Until a recent date little has been done
to prepare these millions for their life
work. In most lines of human, activity
â¢college trained men are the leaders.
The farmer had no opportunity for spe
cial training until the Congress made
provision for it forty years ago. Dur
ing these years progress has been made
and teachers have been prepared. Over
5000 students are in attndanco at our
State agricultural colleges. The Fed
eral Government expends $10,000,000 an
nually toward this education and for
research in Washington and in the sev
eral States and Territories. The De
partment of Agriculture has given fa
cilities for post graduate work to 500
young men during the last seven years,
preparing them for advanced lines of
work in the department and in the
State institutions.
The facts concerning meteorology and
its relations to plant and animal life are
being systematically inquired into.
Temperature and moisture are controll
ing factors In all agricultural opera
tions. The seasons of . the cyclones of
the Caribbean Sea and their paths are
being forecasted with increasing accu
racy. The" cold winds that^ come from
the north ' are . anticipated and their
times and" Intensity told to farmers,
gardeners and fruiterers in all southern
localities.
"We sell $250,000,000 worth of animals
and animal products to foreign coun
tries every year, in addition to supply
ing our own people more cheaply and
abundantly than any ; other nation is
able to provide for its people. Success
ful manufacturing depends primarily
on cheap food, which accounts to a con
siderable extent for our growth in this
direction. The Department" of Agricul
ture, by careful inspection- of ' meats,
guards the health of - our â - people and
gives clean bills of health to deserving
exports; it is prepared to deal promptly
with imported diseases of animals, and
maintain the excellence" of ' our ? flocks
and herds In this respect.*- There should
be an annual census of the livestock
of the nation, -fgttg
-We sell abroad about $600,000,000
worth of plants and their products
every year. Strenuous efforts are be
ing made to Import from farelpm coun
tries such grains as are suitable to our
varying localities. Seven years ago we
bought three-fourths of our. rice; by
helping the rice growers on the Gulf
coaht to secure seeds from the Orient
suited to their conditions, and by giv
ing them adequate protection, they now
supply home demand and export to the
islands of the Caribbean Sea and to
other rice growing countries. Wheat
and other grains have been imported
from light rainfall countries to our
lands in the West and Southwest that
have not .grown crops because of light
precipitation, resulting In an extensive
addition to our cropping area and our
home-making territory that cannot be
irrigated. Ten million bushels of flrst
class macaroni wheat were grown from
these experimental Importations last
year. Â» Fruits suitable to our soils and
climates are being imported from all
the countries of the Old Worldâ the
fig from Turkey, the almond from Spain,
the date from Algeria, the mango from
India. We are helping our fruit grow
ers to get their crops into European
markets by studying methods of pres
ervation through refrigeration, packing
and handling, which have been quite
successful. We are helping our hop
growers by importing varieties that
ripen earlier and later than the kinds
they have been raising, thereby length
ening the harvesting season. The cot
ton crop of the country is threatened
with root rot, the bollworm and the boll
weevil. Our pathologists will find im
mune varieties that will resist the root
disease and the bollworm can be dealt
with, but the boll weevil is a serious
menace to the cotton crop.- It is a
Central American insect that has be
come acclimated in Texas and has dono
great damage. A scientist of the De
partment of Agriculture has found the
weevil at home in Guatemala being
kept in check by an ant, which has been
brought to our cotton fields for obser
vation, it is hoped that it may serve
a good purpose.
The soils of the country are getting
attention from the farmer's standpoint,
and Interesting results are following.
We have duplicates of the soils that
grow the wrapper tobacco in Sumatra
and the filler tobacco in Cuba. It will
be only a question of time when the
large amounts paid to these countries
will bo paid to our own people. The
reclamation of alkali land is progress
ing, to. give object lessons to our people
in methods by which worthless lands
may be made productive.
The insect friends and enemies of the
farmer are getting attention. The ene
my of the San Jose. scale was found
near the Great Wall of China, and is
now cleaning up all our orchards. The
flg fertilizing insect imported from Tur
key has helped to establish an indus
try in California that amounts to from
fifty to one hundred tons of dried figs
annually, and is extending over the
Pacific Coast. A parasitic fly from
South Africa is keeping in subjection
the black scale, the worst pest of the
orange, and lemon industry in Califor
nia. -
Careful preliminary work ia being
dene toward producing our own silk.
The mulberry is being distributed in
large numbers, eggs are being Imported
and distributed, improved reels were
imported from Europe last year, and
two expert reelers were brought to
Washington to reel the crop of cocoons
and teach the art to our own people.
The crop reporting system of the De
partment of Agriculture is being
brought closer to accuracy every year.
It has 250,000 reporters selected from
people in eight vocations in life. It has
arrangements with most European
countries for interchange of estimates,
so that our people may know as nearly
as possible with what they must com
pete.
Irrigation Projects
and Forest Reserve
Rapid Progress Toward the Re
clamation of Arid Lands
in the West.
During: the two and a half years
that have elapsed since the, passage of
the reclamation act rapid progress
has been made in the surveys and ex
aminations of the opportunities for
reclamation in the thirteen States and
three Territories of the arid West. Con
struction has already, been begun on
the largest and most important of the
Irrigation works, and plans are being
completed for works which will utilize
the funds now available. The opera
tions are being carried on by the Re
clamation Service, a corps of engineers
selected through competitive civil ser
vice examinations. This corps Includes
experienced consulting and construct
ing engineers as well as .various experts
in mechanical and legal matters, and Is
composed largely, of men who have
spent most of their lives in practical
affairs connected with irrigation. The
larger, problems have been solved and
It now remains to . execute with 'care,
economy and thoroughness the work
which has been laid out. All Important
details are being caref ul.y. considered
by boards of consulting engineers, se
lected for . their thorough knowledge
and practical experience. Each project
is taken up on the ground by competent
men and viewed from: the standpoint
of the creation oJ prosperous homes,
and of promptly refunding ' to the
Treasury the cost of construction. The
reclamation act' has been found to be
remarkably complete and effective, and
so broad in its provisions that. a wide
range of undertakings has been possible
under it. ''At the same time, economy
is guaranteed by the fact that the
funds must ultimately be returned to be
used over again.
It is the cardinal principle of the for
est reserve policy of this administration
that the reserves are for use. "Whatever
Interferes with the use of their, re
sourcesls to be avoided by every pos
sible means. But these resources must
be us*d in such a way as to make them
permanent.
The forest policy of the Government
i8/3U8tlnow a subject of vivid public
Interest throughout the West and to the
people 1 of. the United States in general.
The , forest * reserves : .themselves are " of
extreme value to^he present as .well as
to the future welfare of all the Western
public land States. They powerfully
affect the use and disposalof the public
land,?. They are of special . importance
because they preserve the water supply
and the supply of timber for domestic
purposes, and so promote settlement
under the reclamation act. Indeed, they
are essential to the welfare of every
one of the great interests of the West.
Forest reserves are created for two
principal purposes. The first is to pre
serve the water supply. This is their
most important use. The principal users
of the water thus preserved are irriga
tion, ranchers and settlers, cities and
towns to whom their municipal water
supplies are of the very first impor
tance, users and furnishers of water
power, and the users of water for do
mestic, manufacturing, mining and
other purposes. All these are directly
dependent upon the forest reserves.
The second reason for which forest
reserves are created is to preserve the
timber supply for various classes of
wood users.. Among the more impor
tant of these are settlers under the re
clamation act and other acts, for whom
a cheap and accessible supply of timber
for domestic uses is absolutely neces
sary; miners and prospectors, who are
In serious danger of losing their timber
supply by fire or through export by
lumber companies when timber lands
adjacent to their mines pass into pri
vate ownership; lumbermen, transpor
tation companies, builders and commer
cial Interests in general.
Although the wisdom of creating for
est reserves is nearly everywhere hear
tily recognized, yet, in a few v localities
there has been misunderstanding and
complaint. The following statement is
therefore desirable:
The forest reserve policy can be suc
cessful only when It has the full sup
port of the people of the West. It can
not safely and should not In any case
be imposed upon them against their
will. But neither can we accept the
views of those whose only interest in
the forest Is '-temporary; who are anx
ious to reap what they have not sown,
and then move away, leaving desolation
behind them. On the contrary, it is
everywhere and always the interest of
the permanent settler and the perma
nent business man, the man with a
stake in the country, which must be
'considered and which must decide.
The making of forest reserves within
railroad and wagon road land grant
limits will hereafter, aV for the past
three years, be so managed as to pre
vent the issue, under the act of June 4,
1S97, of base for exchange or lieu se
lection (usually called scrip)." In all
cases where forest reserves within
areas covered by land grants appear to
be essential to the prosperity of settlers,
miners or others, the Government lands
within such proposed forest reserves
will, as in the recent past, be with
drawn from sale or entry pending the
completion of such negotiations with
thf owners of the land grants as will
prevent the creation of so-called scrip.
It was formerly the custom to make
forest reserves without first getting
definite and detailed information as to
the character of land and timber with
in their boundaries. This method of
action often resulted in badly chosen
boundaries and consequent injustice to
settlers and others. Therefore, this ad
ministration adopted the present meth
od of first withdrawing the land from
disposal, followed by careful examina
tion on the ground and the preparation
of detailed maps and descriptions, be
fore any forest reserve is created.
I have repeatedly called attention to
the confusion which exists in govern
ment forest matters because the work
is scattered among three independent
organizations. The United States Is
the only one of the great nations In
which the forest work of the Govern
ment is not concentrated under one
department, ift â¢ consonance with . the
plainest dictates of good administration
and common sense. The present ar
rangement is bad from every point of
view. Merely to mention it is to prove
that It should be terminated at once.
As I have repeatedly recommended, all
the forest work of the Government
should be concentrated in the Depart
ment of Agriculture, where the larger
part of that work is already done,
where practically all of the trained for
esters of the Government are employed,
where chiefly In Washington there is
comprehensive first-hand knowledge of
the problems of the reserves acquired
on the ground, where all problems re
lating to growth from the soil are al
ready gathered, and where - all the
sciences auxiliary to forestry are at
hand for prompt and effective co-oper
ation. These reasons are decisive in
themselves, but it should be added that
the. great organizations of citizens
whose interests are affected by the for
est reserves, such as the National Live
Stock Association, the National Wool
Growers' Association, the American
Mining Congress, the National Irri
gation Congress and the National
Board of . Trade, have uniformly, em
phatically and most of them repeat
edly, expressed themselves in favor of
placing all Government forest work in
the Department of Agriculture because
of the peculiar adaptation of that de
partment for it. It is true, also, that
the forest services of nearly all the
great nations of the world are under
the respective departments of agricul
ture, while in but two of the smaller
nations and in one colony are they
under the Department of the Interior.
This is the. result of long and varied
experience and It agrees fully with the
requirements of good administration In
our own case. - 4
The creation of a forest service in the
Department of Agriculture will-nave
for its important results: ',
. Firstâ A better handling of all forest
work, because It wlllbe under a single
head, and because the vast and indis
pensable experience of 'the , department
in all matters pertaining to the forest
reserves, to forestry in general, and to
other forms of production from the
soil, will be easily and rapidly access
ible. ' >
Secondâ The reserves themselves, be
ing handled from -the point of view of
the man in the field, Instead of the man
in . the office. . will be more easily and
more ;. widely, useful to the people of
the West than has been the case hith
erto. :â¢ â '-.' ; â -'â .::â -â¢Â«
Thirdâ Within a comparatively short
time the reserves ,will;become self-sup
porting. -This - is important,] ; because
continually ' and rapidly increasing ap
propriations >will r be \ necessary, for the
proper, care of this ; exceedingly "import
ant â¢ interest ' of the f nation, and â  they
can and should be offset by returns
from the national forests. Under simi
lar circumstances the forest possessions
of other great nations form an import
ant source of revenue to their Govern
ments.
Every administrative officer concerned
is convinced of the necessity for the
proposed consolidation of forest work in
the Department of Agriculture, and I
myself have urged it more than once
in former messages. Again I commend
it to the early and favorable consid
eration of the Congress. The interests
of the nation at large and of the West
in particular have suffered greatly be
cause of the delay.
I call the attention of the Congress
again to the report and recommenda
tion of the Commission on the Public
Lands forwarded by me to the second
session of the present Congress. The
commission has prosecuted its investi
gations actively during the past season,
and a second report is now in an ad
vanced stage of preparation.
In connection with the work of the
forest reserves I desire again to urge
upon the Congress the importance of
authorizing the President to set aside
certain portions of these reserves or
other public lands as game refuges for
the preservation of the bison, the
wapiti and other large beasts once so
abundant in our woods and mountains
and on our great plains, and now tend
ing toward extinction. Every support
should be give to the authorities of the
Yellowstone Park in their successful
efforts at preserving the large creatures
therein;, and at very little expense por
tions of the public domain In other
regions which are wholly unsuited to
agricultural settlement eould be simi
larly utilized. We owe it to future
generations to keep alive the noble
and beautiful creatures which by their
presence add such distinctive character
to the American wilderness. The limits
of the Yellowstone Park should be ex
tended southward. The Canyon of the
Colorado should be made a national
park: and the national-park system
should include the Yosemite and as
many as possible of the groves of giant
trees in California.
Nation Owes Much
to Its War Heroes
Present Management of the Pen-
sion Bureau Is Entirely
Satisfactory.
The veterans of the Civil War have
a claim upon the nation* such as no
other body of our citizens possess. The
Pension Bureau has never in its history
been managed in a more satisfactory
manner than is now the case.
Indians Zrrogressmy
TJoward Civilization
Benefited by Nezv Policy That
Compels Them to Work for
Subsistence.
The progress of the Indians toward
civilization, though not rapid, is per
haps all that could be hoped for in
view of the circumstances. Within the
past year many tribes have shown, in
a degree greater than ever before, an
appreciation of the necessity of work.
This changed attitude is in' part due to
the policy recently pursued of reduc
ing' the amount of subsistence to th-
Indians, and thus - forcing them,
through sheer necessity, to work for
a livelihood. The policy, though severe,
is a useful one, but it is to be exercised
only with judgment and with a fall
understanding of the conditions which
exist in each community for which it
is intended. On or near the Indian res
ervations there is usually very little
demand for labor, and if the Indians
are to earn their living and when work
cannot be furnished from outside
(which is always preferable), then it
must be furnished by the Government.
Practical instruction of this kind won id
in a few years result in the forming of
habits of regular industry, which would
render the Indian a producer and would
effect a great reduction in the cost of
his maintenance.
It is commonly declared that the slow
advance of the Indians is due to the
unsatisfactory character of the men
appointed to take immediate charge of
them, and tu some extent this is true.
While the standard of the employes in
the Indian Service shows great Im
provement over' that of bygone years,
and while actual corruption or flagrant
dishonesty is now the rare exception,
it is nevertheless the fact that the
salaries paid Indian agents are not
large enough to attract the best men to
that field of work. To achieve satis
factory results the official in charge of
an Indlun tribe should possess the
high qualifications which are required
in the manager of a large business, but
only in exceptional cases is it possible
to secure men of such a type for these
positions. Much better service, how
ever, might be obtained from those
now holding the places were it prac
ticable to get out of them the best
that is in them, and this should be
dc-ne by bringing them constantly into
closer touch with their superior officers.
An agent who has been content to draw
his salary, giving in return the least
possible equivalent in effort and ser
vice, nyiy, by proper treatment, by
suggestion a-nd encouragement, or per
sistent urging, be stimulated to greater
effort and induced to take a more
active personal interest in his work.
Under existing conditions an Indian
agent . in the distant West may be
wholly out of touch with the office of
the Indian Bureau. He may very well
feel that no one takes a personal in
terest In ~ him or his efforts. Certain
routine duties in the way of reports
and accounts are required of him, but
there is no one with whom he may
intelligently consult on matters vital
to his work, except after lemg delay.
Such a man would be greatly encour
aged and aided by personal contact
with some one whose interest In Indian
affairs and whose authority in the
Indian Bureau were greater than his
own, and such contact would be certain
to arouse and constantly increase the
interest' he takes in his work.
The distance which separates the
agents â the workers in the fieldâfrom
the Indian Office in, Washington is a
chief obstacle to Indian progress.
Whatever shall more closely unite these
two branches of the Indian service and
shall enable them to co-operate more
heartily and more effectively, will be
for the Increased efficiency of the work
and the betterment of the race for
whose improvement the Indian Bureau
was established. The appointment of
a field assistant to the Commissioner
of Indian Affairs would be Â° certain to
insure this good end. Such an official,
if possessed ' of the requisite energy
and deep Interest In 'he work, would
be^ a" most efficient factor in bringing
into ; closer . relationship and a more
direct union- of effort the ' Bureau in
Washington and its agents In the field;
and with the co-operation of Its
branches thus secured the Indian Bu
reau would, in measure fuller than ever
before, lift up the savage toward that
self-help and self-reliance which con
stitute the man.
In 1907 there will be held at Hampton
Roads the tricentennlal celebration of
the settlement of Jamestown, Virginia,
with which the history of what has
now become the United States really
begins. I commend this to your favor
able consideration. It is an event of
prime historic significance, in which all
the pecple of the United States should
feel, and should show, great and gen
eral interest.
POSTAL SERVICE.
Increased Efficiency Shown
in This Branch.
In the Postofflce Department the ser
vice has increased in efficiency, and
conditions as to revenue and expendi
ture continue satisfactory. The in
crease of revenue during the year was
$9,358,181 10. or 6.9 per cent, the total
receipts amounting to $143,382,624 34.
The expenditures were 1132.362,116 70,
an Increase of abtrut 9 per cent over
the previous year, being thus $3,979,
492 36 In excess of the current revenue.
Included in these expenditures was a
total appropriation of $12,956,637 33 for
the continuation and extension of the
rural free-delivery service, which was
an increase of $4,902,237 35 over the
amount expended for this purpose in
the preceding fiscal year. Large as
this expenditure has been the beneficent
results attained In extending the free
distribution of mails to the residents
of rural districts have justified the wis
dom of the outlay. Statistics brought
down to the 1st of October, 1904, show
that on that date there were 27,108
rural routes established, serving ap
proximately 12,000,000 people in rural
districts remote from postofflces. ar.d
that there were pending at that time
3S59 petitions for the establishment of
new rural routes. Unquestionably some
part of the general Increase in receipts
is due tcr the increased postal facilities
which the rural service has afforded.
The revenues have also been aided
greatly by amendments in the classi
fication of mail matter, and the cur
tailment of abuses of the second-class
mailing privilege. The average in
crease in the volume of mail matter for
the period beginning with 1902 and end-
Ing June, 1905 (that portion for 1905
being estimated), is 40.47 per cent, as
compared with 25.46 per cent for the
period Immediately preceding, and 15.92
for the four-year period immediately
preceding that.
Our consular system needs improve
ment. Salaries should be substituted
for fees, and the proper classification,
grading and transfer of consular offi
cers should be provided. I am not pre
pared to say that a competitve system
of examinations for appointment would
work well, but by law it should be pro
vided that Consuls should be familiar,
according to places for which they
apply, with the French? German or
Spanish languages, and should possess
acquaintance with the resources of the
United States.
The collection of objects of art con
templated in section 5586 of the Revised
Statutes should be designated, and es
tablished as a National Gallery of Art:
and the Smithsonian Institution should
be authorized to accept any additions
to said collection that may be received
by gift, bequest or devise.
It is desirable to enact a proper na
tional quarantine law. It is most unde
sirable that a State should on its own
initiative enforce quarantine regula
tions which are" in effect a restriction
upon interstate and international com
merce. The question should properly
be assumed by the Government alone.
The surgeon general of the National
Public Health and Marine Hospital
Service has repeatedly and convincing
ly set forth the need for such legisla
tion.
I call your attention to the great ex
travagance in printing and binding:
Government publications, and especial
ly to the fact that altogether too many
of theae publications are printed. There
is a constant tendency to increase their
number and their volume. It is an
understatement to say that no appre
ciable harm would be caused by, and
substantial benefit would accrue from,
decreasing the amount of printing now
done by at least one-half. Probably the
great majority of the Government re
ports and the like now printed are
never read at all. and furthermore the
printing of much of the material con
tained in many of the remaining ones
serves no useful purpose whatever.
CURRENCY SYSTEM.
Houses of Congress Charged
With Its Betterment.
The attention of the Congress should
be especially given to the currency
question, and in the two houses
the standing committees on the
matter charged with the duty
should take up the matter uf
our currency and "see whether
it is not possible to secure an agree
ment in the business world for better-
Ing the system: the committees should
consider the question of the retirement
of the greenbacks and the problem of
securing in our currency such elasticity
as is consistent with safety. Every
silver dollar should be made by law
redeemable in gold at the option of the
holder.

consideration which its Importance and
timeliness merit."
In his annual message of 1S99 he
apain called attention to this recom
mendation, quoting it^and stated fur
ther:
"I now renew this recommendation,
as the importance of the subject has
steadily grown since it was first sub
mitted to you. and no time should be
loct in studying for ourselves the re
sources of this preat field for American
trade and enterprise."
> "Hie importance of securing proper in
formation and data with a view to the
enlargement of our trade with Asia is
undiminished. Our consular represen
tatives In China have strongly urged
a place for permanent display of Amer
ican products In some prominent- trade
center of that empire, under Govern
ment control and management, as an
effective means of advancing our ex
port trade therein. I call the attention
of the Congress to the desirability of
carrying out these suggestions.
â J'arQtgn Smmfgrantd
and 7f aiuralization
Citizenship of the United State*
Should Be Guarded Against
Debasement.
In dealing with the questions of Im
migration and' naturalization it is in
dispensable to keep certain facts ever
before the minds of those who share
in enacting the laws. First and fore
most, let us remember that the ques
tion of being a good American has
nothing whatever to do with a man's
birthplace any more than it has to do
with his creed. In every generation
from the time this Government was
founded men of foreign birth have
stood in the very foremost rank of good
citizenship, and that not merely in one
but in even* field of American activity;
while to try to draw a distinction be
tween the man whose parents came to
this country and the man whose ances
tors came to it several generations
back is a mere absurdity. Good Amer
icanism is a matter of heart, of con
science, of lofty aspiration, of sound
common Fense. but not of birthplace
or of creed. The medal of honor, the
highest prize be won by those who
serve in the army and the navy of the
United States, decorates men born here,
and it also decorates men born in
Great Britain and Ireland, in Germany,
in Scandinavia, in France and doubt
less in other countries also. In the
field r.t statesmanship, in the field of
business, in the field of philanthropic
endeavor, it is equally true that among
tb* men of whom we are most proud
as Americans no distinction whatever
can be drawn between those who them
selves or whos*- parents came over in
sailir.e ship or steamer from acrcss the
water and those whose ancestors step
;>ed ashore into the wooded â¢wilderness
at Plymouth or at the mouth of the
Hudson, the Delaware or the James
nearly three "centuries ago. No fellow
citizen of ours is entitled to any pe
culiar regard because of the way in
which he worships his Maker, or be
cause of the birthplace of himself or
his parents, nor should he be in any
way discriminated against therefor.
Each must stand on his worth as a
man and each is entitled to be judged
solely thereby.
There is no danger of having too
many immigrants of the right kind.
It makes no difference from what coun
try they come. If they are sound In
body and in mind, and, above all. if
they are of good character, so that we
can rest' assured that their children and
grandchildren will be worthy fellow
citizens of our children and grand
children, then we should welcome them
with cordial nospitality.
But tho citizenship of this country
should not be debased. It is vital that
we ghouH keep high the standard of
well-b^inp Among oar wage-workers,
an* therefore we should not admit
masses of men whose standards of liv
ir.e and whose personal customs and
habits are such that they tend to lower
the level of the American wage- worker;
and above ail we should not admit any
m*n of an unworthy type, any man
concerning whom we can say that he
will himself be a bad citizen, or that
his children and grandchildren will de
tract from instead of addin? to the sum
nf the good citizenship of the country-
Similarly we should take the greatest
'-arp about naturalization. Fraudulent
naturalization, the naturalization of
improper persons, is a curse to our
Government; and It is the affair of
every honest voter, wherever born, to
*ee that no fraudulent voting is al
lowed, that no fraud In connection with
naturalization is permitted.
In the past year the cases of false,
fraudulent and improper naturalization
of aliens coming to the attention of the
executive branches of the Government
have increased to an alarming degree.
.Kxteasive sales of forged certificate*
of naturalization have been â¢discovered,
as well as many cases of naturalization
secured by perjury and fraud; and in
addition, instances have accumulated
showing that many courts issue certifi
cates of naturalization carelessly and
upon insufficient evidence,
â¢ Under the constitution it is in the
power of the Congress "to establish a
uniform rule of naturalization," and
numerous law? have from time to time
been enacted for that purpose, which
have been supplemented In a few States
by Ftm* laws having special applica
tion. The Federal statutes permit nat
uralization by any court of record In
the United States having common law
Jurisdiction and a seal and clerk, ex
cept-ihÂ«? police court of the District of
Columbia. ;ind nearly all these courts
exercise this important function. ; It
rorults that where so many courts of
such varying grades have Jurisdiction.
therÂ» is lack of uniformity in the rules
applied in conferring naturalization.
Some courts are strict and others lax.
An alion rrho may secure naturalization
in one Â£lacÂ« might be denied it In au
oth^r. and the intent of the constitu
tional provision is in fact defeated.
Furthermore, the certificates of natur
alization issued by the courts differ
widely In wording ar.d appearance, and
when they are brought into use in for
'ign countries are frequently subject to
suspicion.
CITIZENSHIP LAWS.
Problem That Requires In
quiry and Legislation.
There chould be a comprehensive re
vision ot the naturalization laws. The
court* having: power to naturalize
phould hÂ» definitely named by national
authority: the testimony upon which
naturalisation may be conferred should
b* definitely prescribed; publication of
imp*ndfnjr naturalization application?
should t*i required . in advance of their
hearing in court:. the form and wording
< f all certificates irsued should be uni
to^m thrcuphout the country, and the
eonrtr should be required 'to make re-
turns to the Secretaryof State at stated
periods of all naturalizations conferred.
Not only are the laws relating to nat
uralization uotv defective, but those re
lating to citizenship of the United
States ought also to be made the sub
ject of scientific inquiry with a view
fo probable further legislation. By what
acts expatriation may be assumed to
have bÂ«vn accomplished, how long an
American citizen may reside abroad
and receive the protection of our pass
port, whether any degree of protec
tion should be extended to one who has
maile the declaration of intention to
become a citizen of the United States
but has not secured naturalization, are
questions of serious import, involving
personal rights and often producing
friction between this Government and
foreign Governments. Yet upon these
questions our laws are silent. I recom
mend that an examination be made into
the subj*.-cts of citizenship, expatria
tion and protection of â  Americans
abroad, with a view to appropriate leg
islation. " . . "-
The power of the Government to pro
tect the integrity of the elections of its
own officials is inherent and has been
recognized and affirmed by repeated
declarations of the Supreme Court.
There is no enemy of free government
more dangerous and none so insidious
as the corruption of the electorate. No
one defends or excuses corruption, and
it would seem to follow that none would
oppose vigorous measures to eradicate
it- I recommend the enactment of a
law 'directed against bribery and cor
ruption in Federal elections. The de
tails of such a law may be safely left
to the wise* discretion of the congress,
but it should go as far as under the
constitution it is possible to go, and
should include severe penalties against
him who gives or receives a bribe in
tended to influence his act or opinion
as an elector; and provisions for the
publication not only of the expendi
tures for nominations and elections of
all candidates but also of all contribu
tions received and expenditures made
by political committees.

Justice Defeated by Peculiar
Operation of Laws, v j
Xo subject is better worthy the atÂ«4
tention of the CongTess than that por
tion of the report of the Attorney Gen
eral dealing win the long- delays and
the great obstruction to Justice expe
rienced in the cases of Beavers, Green
and Gaynor and Benson. Were these
isolated and special cases, I should
not call your attention to them; but
the difficulties encountered as regards
these men who have been indicted for ,
criminal practices are not exceptional;
they are precisely similar in kind to
what occurs again and again in the**
case of criminals who have sufficient
means to enable them to take advant
age of a system of procedure which
has grown up in the Federal courts,
and which amounts In effect to making
the law easy of enforcement against
the man who has no money, and diffi
cult of enforcement, even to the point
of sometimes securing immunity, as re
gards the man who ha* money. In
criminal cases the writ of the United
States should run throughout its bor
ders. The wheels of Justice should not
be clogged, as they have been clogged
in the cases above mentioned, where It
has proved absolutely impossible to
bring the accused to the place appoint
ed by the constitution for his trial. Of
recent years there has been grave and
Increasing complaint of the difficulty,
of bringing to justice those criminals
whose criminality, instead of being
against one person in the republic, Is
against all persons in the republic, be
cause it is against the republic itself.
Under any circumstance and from the
very nature of the case it is often ex
ceedingly difficult to secure proper pun
ishment of those who have been guilty
of wrongdoing against the Government.
By the time the offender can be brought
into court the popular wrath against
him has generally subsided; and there
is in most instances very slight danger
Indeed of any prejudice existing in the
minds of the jury against him. At pres
ent the interests of the Innocent .man
are amply safeguarded; but the inter
ests of the Government, that Is, the In
terests of honest administration, that
is the interests of thej people, are not
recognized as they should be. No sub
ject better warrants the attention of
the Congress. Indeed, no subject bet
ter warrants the attention of the bench
and the bar throughout the United
States.

Territory's Progress Necessitates
i. Many Reforms in Laws
Affecting It.
Alaska, like all our Territorial acqui
sitions, has proved resourceful beyond
the expectations of those who made
the purchase. It has become the home
of many hardy, industrious, and thrifty
American citizens. Towns of a perma
nent character have been built. The
extent of its wealth in minerals, timber,
fisheries and agriculture, while great,
is probably not comprehended yet in
any Just measure by our people. We
do know, however, that' from a very
small beginning its products have
grown until they are a steady and ma
terial contribution to the wealth of the
nation. Owing to the immensity of
Alaska and its location In the far north,
it is a difficult matter to provide many
things essential to its growth and to
the happiness and comfort of its people
by private enterprise alone. It should,
therefore, receive reasonable aid from
the Government. The Government has
already done excellent work for Alaska
in laying cables and building telegraph
lines. This work has been done in the
most economical and efficient way by
the signal corps of the army.
In some respects ft has outgrown its

have been found to be inadequate. In
order to obtain information upon which
I could rely I caused an official of the
Department. of Justice, in whose Judg

during the past summer for the pur
pose of ascertaining how government
is administered there and what legisla

exist, together with some recommenda

I strongly concur, will be found In thf

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL. WEDNESDAY. DECEMBER 7. 1901.
Trust Abuses Must Be Eliminated.
WHEN we come to deai with great corporations the. need for the Government to act di
rectly is far greater than in the case of labor, because great corporations can become such
only by engaging in interstate commerce, and interstate commerce is peculiarly the field of
the General Government. It is an absurdity to expect to eliminate the abuses in great corporations
by State action. It is difficult to be patient with an argument- that such matters should be left
to the States, because more than one State pursues the policy or creating on easy terms corpora
tions which are never operated within that-State at all, but in other States, whose laws they
ignore. * * * Great corporations are necessary, and only men of great and singular men
tal power can manage such corporations successfully, and such men must have great rewards.
But these corporations should be managed with due regard to the interest of the public as a
whole. Where this caw be done under the present laws it must be done. Where these laws
come short others should t be enacted to supplement them.
ports, issue Thanksgiving 1 - day procla
mations, and appoint Indian police
men and notaries public. I believe it
essential to good government in Alaska
and therefore recommend that the Con
gress divest the district Judges and. the
clerks of their courts of the adminis
trative or executive functions that they
now exercise and cast them upon the
Governor. This would not be an in
novation; it would simply conform the
government of Alaska to fundamental
principles, making the Governorship a
real instead of a merely nominal office,
and leaving the judges .free to give
their entire attention to 'their judicial
duties and at the same, time removing
them from a great deal of the 6trife
that now embarrasses the judicial of
fice in Alaska.
I also recommend that the salaries of
the district judges and district attor
neys in Alaska be increased so as to
make them equal to those received by
corresponding officers in the United
States after deducting the difference in
the cost of living; that the district at
torneys should be prohibited from en
gaging in private practice; that United
States Commissioners be appointed by
the Governor of the Territory instead
of by the district judges, and that a
fixed salary be provided for them to
take the place of the discredited "fee
system," which should be abolished in
all offices; that a mounted constabu-
lary be created to police the territory
outside the limits of incorporated towns
â a vast section now wholly without
police protection; and that some pro
vision be made to at least lessen the
oppressive delays and costs that now
attend the prosecution of appeals from
the District Court of Alaska. There
should be a division of the existing
Judicial districts and-an increase in the
number of judges.
Alaska should have a delegate in the
Congress, where possible, the Congress
should aid in the construction of needed
wagon roads. Additional lighthouses
should be provided. In my Judgment
it is especially important to aid in such
manner as seems Just and feasible in
the construction of a trunk line of
railway to connect the Gulf of Alaska
with the Yukon River through Ameri
can territory- This would be moet ben
eficial to the development of the re
sources of the Territory,' and . to the
comfort and welfare of its people.
Salmon hatcheries should be estab
lished in many different streams, so as
to secure the preservation of this valu
able food fish. Salmon fisheries and
canneries should be prohibited on cer
tain of the rivers where the mass of
those Indians dwell who live almost
exclusively on fish.
The Alaskan natives are kindly, in
telligent, anxious to learn and willing
to work. Those who have come under
the influence of civilization, even for
a limited period, have proved their
capability erf becoming self-supporting,
self-respecting citizens, and ask only
for the Just enforcement of law and
intelligent instruction and supervision.
Others, living in more remote regions,
primitive, simple hunters and fisher
folk, who -know only the life of the woods
and the waters, are daily being con
fronted with twentieth-century civiliza
tion with all of its complexities. Their
country is being overrun by strangers,
the game slaughtered and driven away,
the streams depleted of fish, and hith
erto unknown and fatal diseases
brought to them, all of which com
bine to Droduce a state of abject pov
erty and want which must result in
their extinction. Action in their inter
est is demanded by every consideration
of Justice and humanity.
The needs of .these people are:
The abolition of the present fee sys
tem, whereby the r : native is degraded.
Imposed upon and taught the injustice
of law.
The establishment of hospitals at
central points, so that contagious dis
eases that are brought < to them con
tinually by incoming whites may be
localized and not allowed to become
epidemic, to spread death and destitu
tion over great areas.
The development of the educational
system in the form of practical training
in such industries as will assure the
Indians self-support under the changed
conditions in which they â¢will have to
live.
The duties of the office of the Gov
ernor should be extended to include the
supervision of Indian affairs, with nec
essary assistants in. different districts.
He should be provided with the means
and the power to protect and advise
the native people, to furnish medical
treatment in time of epidemics, and to
extend material relief in periods of
famine and extreme destitution.
The Alaskan natives should be given
the right to acquire, hold and dispose
of property upon the : same conditions
as given other inhabitants; and the
privilege of citizenship should be given
to such as may be able to meet certain
definite requirements. In Hawaii Con
gress should give' the Governor power
to remove all the officials appointed
under him. The harbor of Honolulu
should be dredged. The Marine Hospi
tal Service should be" empowered to
study leprosy in the islands. I ask spe

high-sounding : language to proclaim I its
ourooses.'or to take positions .which arc
ridiculous if unsupported by potential
force, and then to refuse to provide this
force. â¢ If there is no intention of pro
viding: and of keeping the force neces
sary. to back up a strong attitude, then
it < is far better not to assume such an
attitude.
The steady aim of this nation, as of
all enlightened nations, ' should be. to
strive to bring ever nearer the day
when there shall prevail throughout
the world the peace of justice. There
are kinds of peace which are highly
undesirable, wfcich are In the long run
as destructive as any war. Tyrants
and oppressors have many times made
a wilderness and called it peace. MÂ£ny
times peoples who were slothful or
timid or shortsighted, who had been
enervated by ease- or by luxury, or
misled by false teachings, have shrunk
in unmanly fashion from doing duty
that was stern and that needed self
sacrifice, and have sought to hide from
their own minds their shortcomings,
their ignoble motives, by calling them
love of peace. The peace of tyrannous
terror, the peace of cravenâ Weakness,
the. peace of injustice, all these should
be shunned as we shun unrighteous
war. The goal to set before us as a
nation, the goal which should be set
before all mankind, is the attainment
of the peace of justice, of the peace
which comes when each nation is not
merely safeguarded in its own rights,
but scrupulously recognizes and per
forms its duty toward others. Generally
peace tells for righteousness; but if
there is conflict between the two, then
our fealty is due first to the cause of
righteousness. Unrighteous wars are
common, and unrighteous peace is rare;
but both should be shunned. The right
of freedom and the responsibility for
the exercise of that right cannot be
divorced. One of our great poets has
well and finely said that freedom is
not a gift that tarries long in the hands
of cowards. Neither does it tarrS' long
in the hands of those too slothful, too
dishonest, or too unintelligent to exer
cise it. The eternal vigilance which Is
the price of liberty must be exercised,
sometimes to guard against outside
foes; although of course far more oftei*
to guard against our own selfish or
thoughtless shortcomings.
If these self-evident truths are kept
before us, and only If they are. so kept
before us, we shall have a clear idea of
what our foreisn policy in its larger
aspects , should be. It is our duty to
remember that a nation has no more
right to do injustice to another nation,
strong or weak, than an individual has
to do injustice to another' individual;
that the same moral law applies in one
case as in the other.' But we must also
remember that Â»It ia^aa- much' the duty
of the nation to guard its own rights
and its own interests as it is the duty
of the individual so to do.- Within the
nation . the individual has now dele
gated this right to the state, that is, to
the representative of all the individ
uals, and it is a maxim of the law that
for every wrong there Is a remedy.
But in international, law we have not
advanced, by any means as far as we
have advanced in municipal law. There
is as yet no judicial way of enforcing
a right in international law. When
one nation wrongs another or wrongs
many others, there is no tribunal be
fore which the wrongdoer can be
brought. Either It Is necessary su
pinely to acquiesce In the wrong, and
thus put a premium upon brutality and
aggression, or else it is necessary for
the aggrieved nation valiantly to stand
up for its rights. Until some method is
devised by which there shall be "a de
gree of international control over of
fending nations, it would be a wicked
thing for the most civilized powers, for
those with most sense of international
obligations and with keenest and most
generous appreciation of the difference
between right and wrong, to disarm.
If the great civilized nations of the
present day should" completely disarm,
the result would mean an immediate
recrudescence of barbarism in one form
or another. Under any circumstances
a sufficient armament would have to
be kept up to serve the purposes of
international police; and until inter
national cohesion and the sense of in
ternational duties and rights are far
more advanced than at present, a
nation desirous both of securing re
spect for itself and of doing good to
others must have a force adequate for
the work which it feels is allotted to it
as its part of the general world duty.
Therefore, it follows that a self-re
specting, just and; far-seeing nation
should on the one hand endeavor by
every means to aid in the development
of the various movements which tend
to provide substitutes for war, which
tend to render nations In their, actions
toward one another, and indeed. toward
their own peoples, more responsive to
the general sentiment of humane and
civilized mankind; and on the other
hand that : it should keep prepared,
while scrupulously, avoiding wrong
doing itself, to repel -any wrong, and
in exceptional cases "_ to take action
which in a more advanced stage of in
ternational relations would come under
the head -. of the . exercise of the inter
national police. A great free people
owes. it to itself and to all mankind not
to \ sink into helplessness before the
powers of evil.
ARBITRATION TREATIES.
America Takes Lead Toward
Insuring World's Peace.
We are in every way endeavoring to
help on; with cordial good will, every
movement which** will tend. to bring us
Into more ; friendly relations with the
rest of mankind. â _ In pursuance , of this
policy I shall shortly lay before the
Senate treaties^ of arbitration with' all
powers which are. willing to enter into
these ' treaties with us. It Is not pos
sible at this' period; of the world's.de
velopment to", agree to arbitrate all
matters, but - there , are many matters
of possible "' difference [ between us and
other whichtcan.be thus arbi
trated. /Furthermore, at the request of
the Interparliamentary .Union, an emi
nent body, composed of practical states
men frem all countries, I haveasked the
powers ; to.'Join ;,with ' this Government
in a second Hague conference," at which
it;is ; hoped j that; the, work ; already so
happily I begun * at 'The * Hague Â£ may be
carried some.! steps f urther, toward ; com
pletion. This carries " out the â ' desire
expressed by the first Hague conference i
itself.
It is not .true that the United States
feels any land hunger or entertains any
projects as regards the other nations
of. the Western Hemisphere save such
as are for their welfare. All that this
country desires is to ses the neighbor
ing countries stable, orderly and pros
perous. Any country whose people con
duct themselves well can count upon
our hearty friendship. If a nation
shows that, it knows how to act with
reasonable efficiency arid decency in
social and political matters, if it keeps
order and pays its obligations, . it need
fear no interference from the United
States. Chronic wrongdoing, or an im
potence which results in a general
loosening of the ties of civilized society,
may in America, as elsewhere, ulti
mately require intervention by some
civilized nation, and in the Western
Hemisphere the adherence of the
United States to the Monroe doctrine
may force the United 'States, however
reluctantly, in flagrant cases of such
.wrongdoing or impotence, to the exer
cise of an international police power. If
every country washed by the Carib
bean Sea would show the progress in
stable and just civilization which with
the aid of the Platt amendment Cuba
has shown since our troops left the
island, and which so many of the re
publics in both Americas are constantly
and brilliantly showing, all question of
interference by this nation with their
affairs would be at an end. Our nter
ests and those of our southern neigh
bors are in reality identical. They have
great natural riches, and if within their
borders the reign of law and Justice
obtains, prosperity is sure to come to
them. While they thus obey the prim
ary laws of civilized society they may
rest assured that they will be treated
by us in a spirit of cordial and help
ful sympathy. We would interfere with
them only in the last resort, and then
only if it became evident that their
inability or unwillingness to do Justice
at home and abroad had violated the
rights of the United States or had in
vited foreign aggression to the detri
ment of the entire body of American
nations. It is a mere truism to say
that every nation, whether in America
or anywhere else, which desires' to
maintain its freedom, its independence,
must ultimately realize that the right
of such independence cannot be sepa
rated from the responsibility of making
good use of it.
In asserting the Monroe doctrine, in
taking such Pters.as -we have taken in
regard to Cuba, Venezuela - and Pan
ama, and in . endeavoring to circum
scribe the theater of war in the Far
East, and to secure the open door | in
China, we have acted in our own inter
est as well as in the Interest of human
ity at large. There are, however,* cases
in which, while our own interests are
not greatly Involved, strong appeal Is
made to our sympathies. Ordinarily It
is very much wiser and more useful for
us to concern -ourselves with striving
for our own moral and material bet
terment here at home than to concern
ourselves with trying to better the con
dition of things in other nations. We
have plenty of sins of our own to war
against, and under ordinary circum
stances we can do more for the general
uplifting of humanity by striving
with heart and soul to put a stop to
civic corruption, to brutal lawlessness
and violent race ; prejudices here at
home than by passing resolutions about
wrongdoing elsewhere. Nevertheless
there are occasional crimes committed
on so vast a scale and of such peculiar
horror as to make us doubt whether it
is not our manifest duty to endeavor at
least to show . our disapproval of the
deed and our sympathy with. those who
have suffered by it. The cases must
be extreme in which such a course is
justifiable. There must be- no effort
made to remove the mote from our
brother's eye if we refuse to remove
the beam from our own. But in ex
treme cases action may be justifiable
and proper. What form the action
shall take must depend upon the cir
cumstances of the case; that is, upon
the degree of the atrocity, and upon our
power to remedy it. The cases in
which we could interfere by force of
arms as we interfered to put a stop to
intolerable conditions in Cuba are nec
essarily very few. Yet it is not to be
expected that a people 'like ours, which,
In spite of certain very obvious.short
comings, nevertheless as a whole shows
by its principles of civil and religious
liberty and of orderly freedom, a people
among whom even the worst crime, like
the crime of lynching, isrtever more than
sporadic, so that individuals and not
classes are molested in their funda
mental rights, it is inevitable that such
a nation should desire .eagerly to give
expression to its horror on an occasion
like that of the massacre of the Jews
in KIshenef, or when- it witnesses such
systematic and long-extended ., cruelty
and oppression as the cruelty and op
pression of which the Armenians have
been the victims, and which have won
for. them the indignant pity of the.civ
ilized world.
AMERICANS ABROAD.
Rights of Country's Citizens
â¢Must Be Respected. )
â  Even where it is not possible to se
cure in other nations the observance of
the principles which â¢tCe accept as axio
matic, it is necessary for us firmly to
insist UDQn the rights of our own citi
zens without regard to their creed or
race; without regard to whether they
were. born , here or born abroad. It has
proved .very difficult to : secure from
Russia v the right for our Jewish fellow
citizens to receive passports and travel
through , Russian territory. Such con- ;
ductfis not- only unjust and irritating
toward - us, but it is difficult to see its
wisdom' from Russia's standpoint. No
conceivable good is accomplished by i it.
If Can-: American Jew or an American
Christian - misbehaves .himself in Rus
sia ; he can â¢ at ; once be-, driven out, but
the 5 ordinary ; American Jew, . like the
ordinary "American . Christian, would
behave, just. about as he behaves here,
that * is, behave as any ; good citizen
ought to behave; : and where this is the
case - it is >:&"; wrong against which we
are: entitled i to ?protestv to. refuse' him
his; passport i. without regard to his coni
duct and character, â  merely on racial
and i religious grounds. . In Turkey our
difficulties .arise] less Â» from! the .i way ' ij\
which "our. citizens are sometimes treat-
ed than from the indignation inevitably
excited* in seeing such fearful misrule
as has been witnessed both in Armenia
and Macedonia.
The strong arm of the Government in
enforcing respect for its Just rights in
international matters is the navy of
the United States. I most earnestly
recommend that there be no halt in the
work of upbuilding the American navy.
There is no more patriotic duty before
us as a people than to keep the navy
adequate to the needs of this country's
position. We have undertaken to build
the Isthmian Canal. We have under
taken to secure for ourselves our just
share in the trade of the Orient. We
have undertaken to protect our citizens
from improper treatment m foreign !
lands. We continue steadily to insist I
on the application of the Monroe doc- I
trine to the Western Hemisphere. Un- I
less our attitude in these and all simi-*j
lar matters is to be a mere boastful (
sham we cannot afford to abandon our
naval programme. Our voice is now
potent for peace, and is so potent
because we are not afraid of war. But
our protestations upon behalf of peace
would neither receive nor deserve the
slightest attention if we were impotent
to make them good.
The war which now unfortunately
rages in the Far East has emphasized I
in striking fashion the new possibilities
of naval warfare. The lessons taught
are both strategic and tactical, and are
political as well as military. The ex
periences of the war have shown in
conclusive fashion that while sea-going
and sea-keeping torpedo destroyers are j
indispensable, and fast lightly armed
and armored cruisers . very useful,
yet that the main reliance, the main
standby, in any navy worthy the name
must be the great battleships, heavily
armored and heavilv gunned. Not a
Russian or Japanese battleship has
been sunk by a torpedo-boat, or by
gunfire, while among the less protected
ships cruiser after cruiser has been
destroyed whenever the hostile squad
rons have got within range of one
another's weapons. There will always
be a large field. of usefulness for cruis
ers, especially of the more formidable
type. We need to increase the number
of torpedo-boat destroyers, paying less
heed to their having a knot or two ex
tra speed than to their capacity to keep
the seas for weeks, and, if necessary,
for months at a time. It is wise to
build submarine torpedo-boats, as under
certain circumstances they might be
very useful. But most of all we need
to continue building our fleet of battle
ships, or ships so powerfully armed
that they can inflict the maximum of
damage upon our opponents, and so
well protected that they can suffer a
severe hammering in return without
fatal impairment of their ability to
fight and maneuver. Of course ample
means must be provided for . enabling
the personnel of the navy to be brought
to the highest point of efficiency. Our
great fighting ships and torpedo-boats
must be ceaselessly trained and
maneuvered in squadrons. The officers
and men can only learn their trade
thoroughly by ceaseless practice on the
high seas. In the event of war it would
be -far better to have no ships at all
than to have ships of a poor and in
effective type, or ships which, however
good, were yet manned by untrained
and unskillful crews. The best officers
and men In a poor ship could do noth
ing against fairly good opponents; and
on the other hand, a modern warship
is useless unless the officers and men
aboard her have become adepts in their
duties.' The marksmanship- in our
navy has improved in an extraordinary
degree during the last three years, and
on the whole the types of our battle
ships are improving; but much remains
to be done. Sooner or later we shall
have to provide for 'some method by
which there will be promotions for
merit as well as for seniority, or else
retirement of all those who after a
certain age have not advanced beyond
a certain grade: while no effort must
be spared to make the service attrac
tive to the enlisted men in order that
they may be kept as long as possible In
it. Reservation public schools should
be provided wherever there are navy
yards.
MILITARY NEEDS.
Army Should Be Kept at High
Grade of Proficiency.
"Within the last three years the
United States has set an example in
disarmament where disarmament was
proper. By law our army is fixed at
a maximum of one hundred thousand
and a minimum of sixty thousand men.
When there was insurrection in the
Philippines we kept the army at the
maximum. Peace came in the Philip
pines, and now our army has been re
duced to the minimum at which it is
possible to keep it with, due regard to
its efficiency. The guns now mounted
require twenty-eight thousand men. if
the coast fortifications are to be ade
quately manned. Relatively to the na
tion, it is not now so large as the
police force of New York or Chicago
relatively to the population of either
city. "We need more cfficers; there are
not enough to perform the regular
army work. I> is very Important
that the officers of the army should be
accustomed to handle their men in
masses, as it is also important that the
National Guard of the several States
should ' be ' accustomed to actual field
maneuvering, especially in connection
with the regulars. For this reason we
a.re to be congratulated upon the suc
cess of the field maneuvers at Manassas
last fall, maneuvers in which a larger
number* of regulars and National
Guard took part than was ever before
assembled together in time of peace.
No other civilized nation has, relatively
to its population, such a -diminutive
army as ours; and while the army is
so small we are not to be excused if we
fail to keep it at a. very high grade of
proficiency. It must be incessantly
practiced; the standard for the enlisted
men should be kept very high, while
at the same- time the service should be
made as attractive as possible; and the
standard for the officers should be kept
even higherâ which., as regards the
upper ranks, can best be done by
Introducing some system of selection
and rejection- into the promotions.
We should be able, in the event
of some sudden emergency, to put
Into the field one first-class army corps,
which should be, as a" whole, at least
the equal of any body of .troops of like
number belonging to any other nation.
Great progress has been made in pro
tecting our coasts " by adequate forti
fications with sufficient guns. We
should, however, pay much more heed
than at present^ to . the development of
an extensive system of floating mines
for use in all pur more important har
bors. These mines have been proved
to be a most formidable safeguard
against hostile fleets.
: I earnestly call the attention of the
Congress to the need of amending the
existing 'law relating to the award/of
Congressional medals of honor in the
navy so as to provide that they may be
awarded to : commissioned , officers and
warrant officers as well as to enlisted
men. .These Justly prized medals are
given in' the- army alike to the officers
and .the enlisted men, and, it is most
unjust that the commissioned officers
and warrant officers of the v nayy should
"not in this respect have the same riffhts.
as their brethren in the army and aa
tho enlisted men of the navy.
,
S'liipinos Sncapable
of Sclf~Sovcrnmcnt
Islanders Must Be Helped to Rise
to a Higher Plane of
In the Philippine Islands there has
been during the pa^t year a continua
tion of the steady progress which has
obtained ever since our m*>ps definitely
Â«cot the upper hand of the insurgents.
Ine Philippine people, or, to speak
more accurately, the many tribes, and
even races, sundered from one another
more or less sharply, who go to make
up the people of the Philippine Isl
ands, contain many elements of good
and some elements which we have a
right to hope stand for progress. At
present they are utterly incapable oi
existing in independence at all or of
building up a civilization of their own.
I firmly believe that we can help them
to rise higher and higher In the sealÂ©
of civilzation and of capacity for self
government, and I most earnestly hope
that in the end they will be able to
stand, if not entirely alone, yet in soma
such relation to the United States as
Cuba now stands. This end is not yet
in sight, and it may be Indefinitely
postponed If our people are foolish
enough to turn the attention of the
Filipinos away from the problems of
achieving moral and material prosper
ity, of working for a stable, orderly
and just government, and toward fool
ish and dangerous intrigues for a com
plete Independence for which they arÂ»
as yet totally unfit.
On the other hand our people must
keep steadily before their minds the
fact that the Justification for our stay
in the Philippines must ultimately rest
chiefly upon the good we are able to
do in the islands. I <3o not overlook the
fact that in the development of our
interests in the Pacific Ocean and alonff
its coasts the Philippines have played
and will play an important part, and
that our interests have been served la
more than one way by the possession
of the islands. But our chief reason for
continuing to hold them must be that
we ought in good faith to try to do
our share of the world's work, and
this particular piece of work has been
Imposed upon us by the results of the
war with Spain. The ' problem pre
sented to us in the Philippine Islands
is akin to, but not exactly like, the
problems presented .to the other great
civilized, powers wftlch have posses
sions In the O-ient. There are points
of resemblance in our work to the
work which is being done by the Brit
ish in India and Egypt, by the French
in Algiers, by the Dutch in Java, by
the Russians in Turkestan, by the Jap
anese in Formosa; but more distinctly
than any of these powers we are en
deavoring to develop the natives them
selves so that they shall take an ever
increasing- share in their own govern
ment, and as far as is prudent we are
already admitting their representatives
to a governmental equality with our
own. There are commissioners, judges
and governors in the islands who are
Filipinos and who have exactly the
same share in the government of the
islands as have their colleagues who
are Americans, while ia the lower ranks
of course the great majority of the
public servants are Filipinos. "Within,
two years we shall be trying the ex
periment of an elective lower bouse in
the Philippine Legislature. It may be
that the Filipinos win misuse this Leg
islature, and they certainly will misuse
it If they are misled by foolish persons
here at home into starting an agitation
for their own Independence or Into
any factious) or improper action. In
such case they will do themselves no
good and will stop for the time being
all further effort to advance them and
give them a greater share In their own
government. But if they act with wis
dom and self-restraint, if they show
that they are capable of electing a Leg
islature which in its turn is capable
of taking a sane and efficient part in
the actual work of government, they
can rest assured that a full and in
creasing measure of recognition will be
given them. Above all, they should re
member that their prime needs ara
moral and industrial, not political. It
is a good thing to try the experiment
of giving them a Legislature; but it is
a far better thing to give them schools,
good roads, railroads which will enable
them to get their products to market.
honest courts, an honest and efficient
constabulary, and all that tends to
produce order, peace, fair dealing as
between man and man, and habits of
intelligent Industry and thrift. If they
are safeguarded against oppression,
and if their real wants, material and
spiritual, are studied intelligently and
in a spirit of friendly sympathy, much
more good will be doge them than by
any effort to give them political power,
though this effort may In its own
proper time and place be proper
enough.
Meanwhile our own people should re
member that there Is need for the
highest standard of conduct among tho
Americans sent to the Philippine Isl
ands, not. only among the public serv
ants but among the private Individuals
who go to them. It Is because I feel
this so deeply that In the' administra
tion of these islands I have positively
refused to permit any discrimination
whatsoever for political reasons and
have insisted that in choosing the pub
lic servants consideration should be
paid solely to the worth of the men
chosen and to the needs of the Islands.
There is no higher body of men in oui*
public service than we have in tho
Philippine Islands under Governor*
Wright and his associates. So far as
possible these men should be given a.
free hand, and their suggestions should
receive the hearty backing both of the
executive and of the Congress, There
is need of a vigilant and disinterested
support of our, public servants in the
Philippines by good citizens here In the
United States. Unfortunately, hitherto
those of our people here at home who
have specially claimed to be the cham
pions of the Filipinos have in reality
been their worst enemies. This will
continue to be the case as long as
they strive to make the Filipinos inde
pendent, and stop all industrial devel
opment of the Islands by crying out
against the laws which would bring?
it on the ground that capitalists must
not .."exploit" the Islands. Such pro
ceedings are not only unwise, but arÂ«
most harmful to the Filipinos, who do
not need independence at all. but who
do need good laws, good public servants
and the industrial development that
can only come if the Investment of
American and foreign capital In the
Islands is favored in all legitimate
ways.
Every measure taken concerning the
islands should be taken primarily with
a view to their advantage. We should
certainly give them lower tariff rates
on" their exports to the United States:
If this is not done it will -be a wrong 1
to'extend our shipping laws to them.
I earnestly hope for the immediate en
actment into law of the legislation now
pending to encourage American capital
to seek investment in the islands In
railroads, in factories, in plantations
and in lumbering and mining.
