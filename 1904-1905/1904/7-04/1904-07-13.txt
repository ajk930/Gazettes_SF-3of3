umns, which advanced, against the
Russians! ' When the first column ap
proached Chiekuanching. the Russians
retreated southwest through the vaN

they took up a position on the 'heights
west of Chouchiachang. The Russians
were dislodged at- dusk, when the sec

the' road toward Tongchis, .repulsing
small bodies of 4 the enemy en route.
They "attacked the advance line of the
Russians near Siuyanglaku. The Rus

the Japanese to withdraw.

President Donnelly of the Amalga
mated Meat Cutters and Butcher
Workmen of North America, leader
of the strikers, said in a conversation
to-night that he believed the strikers
would have little difficulty in with
standing a siege of more than a year
with the strike funds the unions have
on hand. In Chicago thirty-five local
unions are involved in the strike.
ATTITUDE OF THE PACKERS.
President Donnelly and the presi
dents of the various locals assembled
at the headquarters this morning,
thinking they might receive a notice
of surrender /rom the packers, but no
word; came. The packers took the po
sition that they had replied decisively
to the workers' demand and had noth
ing more to say, except to . emphasize
a refusal to pay the wage scale asked.
Arthur Meeker, of Armour & Co., said
to-night:
"We consider the demand of the
union for an advance in wages of un
skilled labor entirely unwarranted by
conditions. We" could not concede it
and proposed to submit the question to
"arbitration, which the union' declined
to do and called a strike to-day at all
of our plants. Every department is
kept running, however. We have had
applications from hundreds of "unem
ployed men for positions at less wages
than we have been paying, and every
day expect to Increase our output. We
regret extremely, the hardships and suf
fering; that will - be imposed on the
thousands of men who; are thrown out
of work, directly and indirectly,
"How long do you think it will last?"
inquired one of them, looking quite
serious.
"Dunno," a man replied, "except that
President Donnelly says the men man
aged to- hold out fifteen months in
Buffalo, and I guess we can do as
much."
oughf are .0^ the stockyards and were
roundly cheered as they emerged
through ' the gates and distributed
themselves in the crowd of men who
had awaited their coming.
"We are with you to the last," the
girls exclaimed, smiling prettily as they
stood around and talked over the situa
tion with their male companions in the
movement.

GIRLS JOIN IN STRIKE.
Watched .- by cordons of â¢ police, , the
strikers filed briskly "out of the packing
houses, carrying overalls,' rubber boots
and knives, cleavers and steels. The
strikers were greeted by crowds of
women and children, many' of whom
joined hands with the workmen: on the
outward march. , There was absolutely
no sign of disorder.
The walkout here was started by the
employes of j the Â« killing departments
in the various packing houses. The
killers were followed by' the workers
in the other departments as fast as the
current work left by. the slaughterers
could be cleaned up.. Thus, as the toil
ers in each department disposed of
their part of the work, they threw off
their aprons and- departed. This con
sideration was shown to. the packers,
the labor officials announced, because
it was not the desire of the men to
cause the employers any financial loss
as a result of neglecting meat that. was
on hand to be dressed. '.
CHICAGO, July 12.â As the result of
a stubborn disagreement,- chiefly over
wages for unskilled labor, -one of the
most extensive strikes in the history of
the meat packing industry ' of ' the
United States began to-day in Chicago,
Kansas City, Omaha, St. Joseph, and
other cities where large packing plants
are located. If prolonged! the strike is
expected to cause Â¦ Â¦widespread incon
venience, possibly equaling the anthra
cite coal famine of two years ago. -
The unanimity of the strike was com
plete. More than 45,000 employes are
directly Involved. In Chicago alone
18,000 men are on strike.
The effect of the strike on the food
supply of the country and the price of
meat is being earnestly discussed, not
withstanding the announcement Â¦ to
night that the packing houses, contrary
to expectations, will continue opera
tions without any close-down, employ
ing whatever help may S be available.
How much alleviation in the furnishing
of supplies to the* public this course
may afford is a matter of wide varia
tion of opinion. The packers declare
that hundreds of men who ' could not
be provided with places have been ap
plying dally for work.,
NO SIGN OF DISORDER.

Aftt-r many vain attempts they had
to forsake their efforts and wait for
help, which they knew would likely
be sent out from Camp Curry- The
boys kept up their courage until twen
ty-four hours had gone by and then the
situation began to assume a more seri
ous aspect. Their thirst became al
most unbearable and they had almost
riven up hope when the rescue party
came upon them above the ledge.
As soon as the rescue party discov
ered the lads they had a hurried con
sultation and two of the party were
hurried back to the camp to secure
ropes. After the ropes were secured it
was discovered that the boys were too
weak to attempt to scale the cliff, and
after they had been provided with food
and drink in small quantities C. O.
I>unstall. an officer of Santa Fe, vol
unteered to. go down the ropes and see
how they were faring. He reached
the ledge in safety, but It was impos
bible to Bee either of the three young
men, and darkness coming on it was
decided to wait till daylight before
attempting to rescue them.
Brown, for whom the boys were
searching when they became lost, left
the valley this morning without ren
dering any assistance whatever, say
ing: "I have important . business in
San Francisco." He loudly bewailed
the fate of a revolver loaned to one of
the boys. '.
TOSEMTTE. July 12.â Allen Bates of
Palo Alto and Ned Corbett of Fair
Oaks, the campers at Camp Curry who
last Sunday night went out on the
tearch of L. Brown of San Francisco,
end who themselves became lost, were
located this morning on a ledge 200
ffet below the summit of North Dome.
Up to 9 o'clock to-night they had
not been rescued. Two parties
from Camp Curry had been searching
for them all night and early this morn-
Ing one of the party after repeated
calls heard a faint reply, way below
him. It was impossible to reach the
toys, but one of them said that they
Â¦were nearly famished for want of food
and water, water being what they
craved most. The boys had been thir
ty-six hours without food or water.
As soon as they were discovered an
effort was made to rescue them? but
before long the rescuers found they
had tackled a task more difficult than
*as at first supposed. The boys, it
cc-ems. started out together late Sun
day night owing to the anxiety of Mrs.
Erown to find her husband and son.
In traversing the cliffs around the sum
mit they had in some unaccountable
manner slipped to a ledge 200 feet be
low the summit and had found it lm
posfibie to get back to safety.

Â¦ "On - the, tariff .question some little
progress may be ( hoped : for. v But: the
Parker v men on the .'committee were
nearly all in 'favor of a very conserva
tive fplank and : it remains to be seen
"For these reasons I feel .justified in
supporting the. ticket. A Democratic
victory will mean very little, if any,
progress on economic questions so long
as the party is under the control of the
Wall street element. On the money
question Mr. Parker Is as thoroughly
committed to the side of the financier
as Mr. Roosevelt. If he does not go
as far aa the Republicans would in re
tiring silver dollars, in establishing
branch banks, in enlarging the powers
of the. national* banks and in the sub
stitution of an asset currency for the
present currency, it will be because he
is restrained by the Democrats in the
House and Senate. Nothing greater
can be expected from him on the
money question. On the trust question
theyDemocratic platform is very much
better than the Republican platform,
but the nomination of Judge Parker
virtually nullifies the anti-trust plank.
Unless, in "his letter of acceptance, he
commits himself to anti-trust legisla
tion, we need not expect him to'pur
sue a different course from that pur
sued by President Roosevelt.
"So far as the labor questions are
concerned, we must await Judge Par
ker's letter before we shall know
whether the laboring man has any
thing to expect from his electlqn. The
labor plank, as* prepared by Judge
Parker's, friends on the sub-committee.
Was a straddling, 'meaningless plank.
In the full committee planks were
adopted in favor of arbitration and
the eight-hour day and against Gov
ernment' by injunction; also a plank
on tho Colorado situation. If Judge
Parker is silent or ambiguous on" these
subjects it will . mean that the men
back of . him. will not permit him to
take the labor side on these disputed
questions.), ..... â¢ , ,
PARKER'S STAND 1 ON TARIFF.
"Fourth, the Democratic . platform
declares in favor of the reduction of
the standing'. army, and, as this plank
was unanimously adopted, VJiere is
reason to believe that a Democratic
statement on this svfbject would 'bring
some advantage to the people.

result, all the plants are shut down

Many of the men here were opposed
to going out. Some lived in the district
affected by the recent floods and did;
not feel much like losing .time. and.
wages. It is:partly on this account that

their tools and went out on strike. The
packing plants affected " are those of
Armour, Swift, Cudahy and the Oma

A statement of the position of the
local packers shows that they are
unanimous In their refusal to accede
to the demands of the men. They
claim that conditions d/> not warrant
an increase in wages.
Ten unions are affected by the
strike, most of them being affiliated
with the butchering craft It is an
ticipated, that no action will be taken
locally, all. the negotiations being
made in Chicago.
There was no demonstration in the
packing-house district, the strikers
generally going to their homes and fe
mainlng quiet. The packing-house
owners placed a number of additional
watchmen about their plants, but even
this precaution seemed unnecessary. ,
For the packers it was unauthOrl
tatively stated that no effort would be
made to reopen the plants. Both"
sides apparently take it that the strug

In spite of the favorablem-eather ever

the wheat too quickly, especially in the

President Donnelly, the strike lead
er, said:
"I wish to make it clear that we are
not fighting -for an Increase of wages,
but against the decrease. Our original
demand was for a minimum of 20 cents
an hour for laborers. This demand was
amended after our second conference
with the packers, . in June. We then
agreed to a scale of 18% cents an hour,
except in Omaha and Sioux City, where
the scale is 19 cents. The packers, on
the other hand, refused to pay more
than 1?^ cents an hour, and declined
to sign any agreements at all, except
with a small portion of the workmen.
''The question of wages to skilled
men was not discussed. To unskilled
workmen the average wage was 18J4
cents an hour, but when we asked
that this be made the minimum wage
they cut it to 17J4 cents and 16 cents.
Men could live on 15 cents if they
got steady work, but in some plants
men have been able to work only
thirteen hours a week at this wage
scale. They could not live on It No
one could." i V
Wholesale markets that supply
meats to the hotels of Chicago say
they have enough carcases on hand
to keep the guests of all the large

therefore, are not worrying over an
impending famine.
STOCKYARDS NOT AFFECTED.
A feature of the strike that is apt
to be overlooked is the fact that the
strikers' organization does not include
the electricians,, steam '.fitters, firemen,
engineers, carworkers and teamsters.
These make in Chicago alone a total
of 10,000 additional men, who may or
may not be made idle wholly or in
part," voluntary or r otherwise, accord
ing to' the developments in the strug
gle between the direct contestants â
the 'packing-house proprietors on the
one side and the butchers and helpers
on the other. â¢
through the strike and the temporary
inconvenience .caused the public at
large, but we consider the fault rests
entirely with the union, which not only
asked what it was not entitled to, but
declined to submit the question to im
partial arbitration. :

equal to the total bought by the local
packers.
It is not likely that the strikers
will interfere with the small slaugh
terers throughout the country, inas
much &s the more work they do the
more they will injure the business of
the big packers, upon whom alone the
strikers have made demands.
The Union Stockyards men are tak
ing a calm view of the situation, and
while business at the yards undoubt
edly will show a falling off, it Is be
lieved that receipts and shipments
will by no means come to a standstill
at the yards, and the supply will be
sufficient to take care of the local and
Eastern demand.

COUNT KKLLER, Eleven ,MileS W*est
of Liamiiansiaiv : July,12.4-Th'e opposing
armies are .grimly facing Naiot Heights
across the Liank River, ready to en
gage in a death grapple. '^
The Liank crosses the main Liao
yang- Fengwangcheng, _ road,' twenty
eight miles east . of Laioyang. It
flows north into the Taitse 'River,' which
passes through Liaoyang and; empties
into the Llao River.
A correspondent who arrived here af
ter a thirty-five mile ride from Siao
lindji saw long lines of infantry and
transport trains winding up the rough
mountains. At Liandian3ian a lookout
stationed in a tree top pointed out the
way to General Keller's headquarters,
near Niutkiay. T < i /^'; :^ v
There the Russian eastern army was
found, hidden in the hills. In a plain
tent the correspondent saw General
Keller, living like a simple soldier, his
staff being quartered In a native hut
near by. The general' looked cheerful
and was bronzed by exposure. He
talked of the engagement at Hoiyan.
Around the general's tent were many
officers of the/ guard, the pride of St.
Petersburg. To see them as weather
beaten as the Cossack officers one
could scarcely believe them to be the
dashing guardsmen of the â¢ Russian
capital. They have become hardened
fighters, for hardly a day passes with
out collisions between the advance
posts of the Eastern army and the Jap
anese. Hhe whole army is anxious to
fight General Kuroki, whose army is at
.Vandipudze, and whose men are en
trenched on the other side of the river.
The burning question is: Who will be
the first to cross the broad valley of the
Liank River?
LONDON, July 11â The Foreign Of*
fice announced yesterday that an agree
ment had been signed by Foreign Min-
Ssteh Lanodowne and the German Em
bapsador. providing for the settlement
by arbitration of difficulties which may
arlso of a legal nature or relating to
the interpretation of existing . treaties
l><HTvf-en Germany and Great Britain.
The terms of the agreement are iden
tical with those recently concluded with
Italy, France and Spain.
The announcement came as a com
pote and not altogether pleasant sur
prise to the English press and public.
It was against f-uch an agreement that
th^ Spectator and other powerful or
pans urged thÂ» Governnient prior to
King Edward's visit to Emperor Wil
liam at Kiel. By the papers which
echoed that warning the news of the
tignins of the arbitration treaty is
fr-w allowed with palpabledlpllte or with
ill -concealed disappointment.
The only whole-souled appreciation
comes, curiously enough, from opposi
tion papers. The Daily News, the Gov
ernment's most bitter opponent, warm
ly congratulates King' Edward on his
latest achievement. The Chronicle and
the Leader follow suit, while such' a
stanch mouthpiece of the Government
us the Telegraph expresses the belief
that the Anglo-German treaty cannot
compare in importance with the con
vention concluded with France.
A similar method of evading criti
cism is pursued by the Standard, but
ihe Post frankly defcerts the Govern
ment, characterizing Lord Lansdowne's
latest diplomatic stroke as a "policy of
unsettled convictions and of promiscu
ous amiability.'* -â¢ ; "Â»J-.
The Mail and other papers accentuate
the fact that the agreement is very
limited in scope and deals with minor
matters. The Mail declares there "un
happily is no indication whatever on
the part of Germany of such an amica-
Me disposition as exhibited by France,",
and adds that only if German naval
progress were reduced could both Gov
ernments be congratulated on the ar
ransement. '^S^
LONDON. July 12.â Anglesey cast!e
Is slowly giving up Ha secrets. Th*
catalogues of* its contents when pub
lished v.ill form one of the most re
markable documents ever issued from
the printing press. The fictitious
stories arising out of local gossip
which fixed the value of the jewel3 and
other treasures found in the castle at
a million pounds sterling may be dis
missed, but the facts are in themselves
sufficiently extraordinary. The living
rooms in Anglesey castle are furnished
in a manner that la magnificently ex
travagant.
According to the latest computa
tions, thÂ« lewela that have been dis
covered are expected to realize at auc
tion from $100,000 to $130,000. The orig
inal cost was probably double, but
owing to the fantastic settings their
value is considerably reduced.
The approximate value of the "furni
ture and other articles, apart from the
jewels, real and imitation, that are be
ing catalogued, will probably be some
thing like $300,000. In the house and
grounds every fancy of the Marqul9
has been apparently gratified in the
most luxurious manner.
A meeting of the committee of in
spection has been held which lasted six
hours. The result of the conference is
that there Is now every prospect that
ths affairs of the Marquis will not
come before the bankruptcy court. The
liabilities at present ascertained are
about $1,080,000, and it is believed that
under the proposed deed of assignment
the creditors will receive their money
in full, plus 4 per cent interest, within
nine years, providing the Marquis
lives that long.
The deed of assignment has been
agreed to by a large number of the
creditors, including three Continental
jewelers, who hftve claims for about
$2,400,000, andr'certain English money
lenders.
Small Japanese cavalry detachments
have been observed in the vicinity of
Mukden. The weather there is fine.
ST. PETERSBURG, July 12. â The
.idea, that Vice Admiral Skyrdloff has
gone tÂ© Port Arthur finds no believers
here, but it is known that he has sent
dispatches there Indicating' a more ac
tive policy on the part of the fleet and
as a result comes news of the sortie
of the Bayan, the Diana, the Pallada,
the Xovik and the Poltava. ..The result
is covered with mystery, but it Is sig
nificant of the times.
The inhabitants of Vladivostok have
been summoned to make large de
posits of flour, meat and salt with the
authorities, with the understanding
that these will be served out to them
in case of a siege; Those who cannot
make such deposits are compelled to
leave town, j
A special dispatch from Liaoyang to
the Russ says the losses sustained by.
the army in retiring to the northward
are insignificant. The Japanese con
tinue advancing with four Infantry di
visions and one cavalry brigade, the
object of this pressure being to enable
the Japanese to take Yinkow, which
will serve as an. admirable base from
the south from which to attack Kuro
patkin.. .
CHEFU, July 13.â A Frenchman,
who arrived here on a Junk from Port
Arthur this morning, reports that on
July 7 the Japanese captured fort
No. 14.
The vessel anchored off port on her
return and the captain and some of
the men laid the situation before the
British Consul, who advised the men
to return to the Vessel and proceed on
the voyage. The men returned and the
St. Hubert again sailed for Yokohama
on the afternoon of July 2.
at 8 o'clock the *next morning, with
a mutinous crew on board. -Eight men
refused to sail on the vessel. She thus
â¢left here short-handed and, after go
ing a short distance, all the men re
fused duty. Captain Wardale had <o
return to Honolulu. On the vessel's
manifest the cargo was described as
"nitrate of -soda, for fertilizing pur
poses," but the men claimed it could
also be used for manufacturing pow

crease in sickness after a few days'
rain and also a large proportion of
sick and wounded officers compared
with men. The figures are according
to the listed strength of the armv.
Before the rains, to June 26. Ih^
total was: Officers 71 and men 39 per
thousand, of whom wounded officers
numbered 10 and men 6 per thousand;
suffering from contagious diseases. 2
per thousand, of whom one-half were
suffering from dysentery and -one
tenth from typhus. There was one
case of plague and not a single ca3<>
of smallpox.
After the rains. July 9, the figures
were: Officers, 94 per thousand; men,
46, of whom the wounded officers
numbered 29 per thousand, the men
9 per thousand. Contagious cases had
risen to 9 per thousand, with equal
proportions of dysentery and typhus
and introducing scurvy and smallpox,
of which there were. three cases, and
bringing up the plague to* seven cases.
Twenty-two cases of horse and cat
tle plague were reported.
As soon as the Japanese troops enter
Ylnkow and succeed in removing the'
mines from the mouth of the Llao Riv
er, the Japanese gunboats lying along
the coast will come up, but It is not be
lieved that the Japanese will venture
to land a force or send war materials
so long as the Port Arthur squadron
is able to go out whenever it likes.
There is some anxiety here regarding
a report that the cruiser Askold has
been damaged and It is noticed that
she was not mentioned In the list of
warships constituting the squadron on
its last appearance.
ST. .PETERSBURG, July 13.â The
Japanese "advance to Tatchekiao is
shrouded in mystery. No Â¦ telegrams
have been received by the general staff
or the Admiralty since Lieutenant Gen
eral Sakharoff's dispatch of July; 10,
with the exception of a report from
General Kuropatkln covering the
events detailed by General Sakharon%
which was delayed because it had fol
lowed the Emperor on his journey to
the Volga region.
, The special commission of censors sat
for only one hour last evening because
It- was a holiday (the festival of St.
Peter and St. Paul) and left 'without
having received or given out a single
dispatch. The lack of news from
Tatchekiao is not causing anxiety.
,The evening editions of the St. Pet
ersburg newspapers prominently pub
lished the telegram from Tokio, report
ing another appearance of the Port Ar
thur squadron on the morning of July
9th, and this gladdened the hearts of
the holiday crowd.
: The Japanese account of the fighting
"at.Kiachou is offset by the admission
that they are being greatly Worried by
General RennekampfTs Cossacks.
It h3s been intimated by the general
staff that It Is probable the Japanese
will not attempt to take Ylnkow, 'the
port of Newchwang, before .they cap
ture Tatchekiao, as otherwise they"
would be liable to an unexpected attack
from the Tatchekiao force, which is
within easy striking distance, thanks
to the railroad.,
The Japanese' advance north will be
delayed perhaps for some days until
the southeastern columns converging
at Siandian cqmpel Major General
Mitschenko to draw off leaving the
Siuyen road clear to ( Tanchie and
Tatchekiao.

cisco's leading citizens, died yesterday
afternon at 3 o'clock at the Adler
Sanatorium after a serious illness,
which attacked him suddenly upon his
arrival in the city, last Friday from
his home in Mill Valley. So ill was
the sufferer that he was taken to the
sanatorium, where an operation was
performed, but he "never rallied. Mr.
Hinz had been somewhat indisposed
for some time, but until the illness
which proved fatal his family had no
ihought that the end was so near.
Mr. Hinz was born in Schleswig-
Holsteln sixty-four years ago. In 1867
he came directly to San Francisco and
for many years was a partner in the
firm of Haker & Hinz and subsequent
ly became head of the firm of Hinz. &

He leaves a wife and six children
and a brother, A. Frederick Hinz. of
the Hinz & Plagemann Yolo Flour
Mills. Should Henry Hinz, his son, ar
rive in time from New York- the
funeral will take place on Friday from

TOLEDO. Ohio, July 12.â Samuel J.
Jc-nes, the "Golden Rule Mayor," died
at his home this evening at 5:07 o'clock
as the result of a -complication of dis
eases. - The ; immediate â¢ cause of his
death was an abscess on his lungs.
When this abscess broke the Mayor
was not strong enough to throw off
the poison from his system and death
resulted. The Mayor had suffered for
years from asthma and this was the
primary cause of his fatal illness.
The death of Mayor Jones has caused
the greatest sorrow all over the city.
Although many did not believe in his
ideas on sociological problems, every
body loved and respected him. His one
great hold on The people of Toledo was
his honesty. The Mayor was taken ill
two weeks ago last Saturday and for
the last forty-eight hours previous to
his death was in a comatose condi
tion. He did not regain consciousness
during that time. All the members of
his family were at his bedside at the
time of his death. He left a widow and
three sons, Percy. Paul and Mason
Jones. He will be succeeded as Mayor
by Robert Finch, president of the City
Council.
The remains of Mayor Jones will lie
in state at Memorial Hall on Thursday
and Friday until noon. The funeral
services will be held at the Jones resi
dence on Friday afternoon at 1 o'clock.
The remains will rest on the veranda,
from where the addresses will be made.
The lawns will be open to all. The
pallbearers will be selected from his
employees. 'Â¦:.'

PARIS. July 12.â The Chamber of
Deputies to-day held a tumultuous ses
sion over the report of the committee
which has been Investigating the Char
treuse scandal. The report says that
the charges of attempted bribery were
not sustained and expressed regret that
Premier Combes had made such
charges.
This declaration aroused violent op
position upon the part of the friends of
the Premier,* who brought forth a coun
ter proposition declaring that the Pre
mier and Government were above all
suspicion and denouncing their calum
niators. A noisy debate ensued, during
which the 'Premier censured a number
of Deputies for disorderly conduct.
Eventually the Chamber adopted by
a large majority a resolution declaring
that the Premier and Government were
above suspicion and unanimously
adopted a clause of the resolution de
nouncing the calumniators.
During the disorderly debate M. de
Baudry d'Ausson, Conservative, sought
to place a mock crown of laurel upon
M. Combes as the latter was withdraw
ing from the Chamber. The large
Combes majority terminates the ru
mors that the Investigation might lead
to his retirement from the premier

Hulit will visit several European
countries fn search of a hardy breed
of goats best adapted to introduce into
the United States. He believes that he
will find the most satisfactory animals
in Norway, where there are goats tlfcat
combine hardiness with good milking
qualities.
There are at present about 2,000.000
goats in the country. Mulit is setting
about the task of increasing that num
ber by 18.000,000 and his visit to Wash
ington was for the purpose of arrang
ing to have a large number of these
animals imported free of duty under
the provision of the Dingley act per
mitting free importation of animals
brought into the United States for
breeding purposes.
Incidentally, in discussing his plans,
Hulit told what a great thing it would
be if the goat industry could be es
tablished in the United States. He
said it would give employment to more
persons than are employed by the
United States Steel Corporation and
there was splendid profit to be made In
selling goats' milk at 10 cents a quart.

where, with the aid of prominent phy

WHEELING. W. Va., July 12.â At
the close of the first day of the most

history of the State, following the bit
terest fight the party has ever" expe
rienced, William Mercer Owens.Daw
son is the Republican nominee for
Governor of West Virginia. Claims of
accessions from the ranks of the Daw
son followers, made by .Â« the managers,
of Charles Teter's candidacy, deter
mined the Dawson leaders to make a
test of strength early in the day, and
it came when a motion to dispense
with the committee on credentials, re
sisted stubbornly by the Teterites, was
carried by more than 100 majority.
The Dawson faction followed Its ad
vantage and, despite scenes of the
wildest disorder, during which Senator
Elkins threatened to withdraw from
his position as chairman, they forced a
nomination before the platform was
prepared. The resolutions committee '
will not meet until to-morrow morning,
but the candidate is named. The re
mainder of the ticket will be chosen on
Wednesday.
The convention was called to order
at 12:30 o'clock in the Wheeling Ca
sino, four miles east of the city. Sen
ator Elkins was temporary chairman.
In his speech he said:
"The Democratic party, in its de
sire to capture the State, has nominated
for Vice President one of our most
distinguished citizens and the foremost
Democrat in this State; but in this,' as
in most everything else, the Demo
crats made a mistake. Senator Davis,
to whom I am so nearly related and
for whom I cherish feelings of the high
est regard, admiration and affection,
is a man of affairs and an experienced
statesman, having served his State
creditably in the Senate for twelve
years. With these qualifications and
this fitness he should have been named
for the first place instead of a- man
without a record and without business
or political experience. West Virginia
cannot be beguiled into giving up pro
1 tection and sound money to make
Judge Parker President, even if by so
doing they make Senator Davis Vice
President. I have not the slightest
\ doubt of victory next November. There
is no good reason why a Republican
should change his vote on State and
national politics, but many and
> weighty reasons why he should not.
"The Democracy of West Virginia
I advocates the astounding proposition,
! should it come into power, in the State,
! of disfranchising 15,000 loyal colored
Republicans and robbing them of the
rights of citizenship guaranteed by the
constitution and for which many of

The amendment was as follows:
At a recent meeting of the Demo
cratic County. Committee In Native
Sons Hall William Hoff Cook proposed
an amendment to the constitution giv
ing to each Assembly district the right
to prepare its regular ticket for the
district.
When Tarpey, comes marching home
there will be something doing in poli
tics. As the representative of Cali
fornia Democrats In the national com
mittee of the party he will expect to
be consulted on subjects pertaining to
the management of the campaign in
this State. He will confer with James
H. O'Brien and others in making up
Assembly district delegate tickets to
be voted for at the August primary
election. A victory for Tarpey and
O'Brien, such as winning a majority of
delegates to the local and State con
ventions, would not dislodge McNab
from his position as chief director of
the Democratic organization, because
the early convention . of the party at
Santa Cruz selected the 'State Central
Committee or governing body and Mc-
Nab was 'clever enough to seize the
works while Tarpey was fighting for a
Hearst delegation to the St. Louis con
vention.
There will be something else, how
ever, to wrangle over. Candidates for
the Electoral College and nominees for
Congress and the State Legislature are
to be named, and Tarpey has no
thought of accepting the McNab pro
gramme. Neither will the Assembly
district tickets prepared by the organi
zation be accepted as the regular party
tickets.
Mr. Knight, while confident of ulti
mate success in the fight for the Sen
atorship, does not expect or desire
hard and fast pledges from members
of the Legislature. On this topic he
remarks:
, "I do not want the county conven
tions that will meet to nominate can
didates for the Assembly and Senate
to instruct such candidates to vote for
me for United States Senator; I want
all nominees to be free and unpledged,
that they may exercise their own good
judgment for what is best for the Re
publican party. When the Legislature
meets in January next, if after a can
did and careful consideration of .all
the aspirants for the great honor I
am not the favored one, I want every
member of that body to feel he ha3
broken no pledge or promise and that
I will still be a Republican -and will
cheerfully indorse the Judgment
of that branch of the State govern
ment that has honestly carried out
the people's wishes."
Geoge A. Knight's candidacy for the
office of United States Senator is free
ly discussed in political circles. Sen
ator Thomas Selvage left trie city yes
terday for Humboldt County and upon
his arrival in Eureka will preach the
gospel of Knight. It seems that some
early missionary work for Henry T.
Oxnard in that region of the redwoods
must be undone in order to give
Knight the middle of the road.
Senator Selvage will place prompt
denial on all reports to the effect that
Mr. Oxnard is the only Senatorial as
pirant who is close up to the Presi
dent. Moreover the impression that
George Knight cooes like a .dove oa

THE DALLES, Or.. July 12.â On her
down trip this morning the fast river
steamer Charles R. Spencer met with
a bad accident about eight miles north
of this, city near Rowena staUon, break
ing her hog chains and making it
necessary for her captain to beach her
on the Oregon shore.
The accident was due to the exceed
ingly rough water caused by the heavy
gale which had blown all night and
was still high. Owing to the prompt
action of the officers no alarm was
created among the passengers, who
were immediately landed and walked
to the nearby railway station. The
steamer still lies on the beach, from
which position she will be towed to
this city as early as possible for re
pairs. There was little damage besides
the breaking of the hog chains.

To-morrow the surrounding- country
will be visited under the guidance of
the Chamber of Commerce of Eureka.
There is nÂ» programme for to-night.
The local committee, with rare judg
ment and foresight, thought it best to
let the visitors rest. All will sleep with
visions of giant redwoods, stage
drives, fog effects, bands playing, bril
liant electric cars, hospitable people
and at last real bed. Arriving at their
rooms each member found his baggage
awaiting him and also cards of ad
mission to the Humboldt Club, as well
as all sorts of invitations to banquets
and functions prepared in their honor.
The party came to Eureka, where an
informal reception awaited the guests.
It was natural that the party should be
tired when they reached Eureka. A
stage ride of forty-five miles in one
day over mountain roads is no joke.
But that tired feeling disappeared
when the band commenced to play. Not
only did the people of Eureka have -a
band to welcome the party, but a spe
cial electric car, gayly decorated and
brilliant with electric effects, to con
vey them to the Hotel Vance, where
they will be the guests of Mr. Dough

The girl was missed front her home

to the woods to gather berries. There
have been numerous scares of late
from mountain lions, which have be
come very bold, and when Emily did
not return in good season the alarm
was given and the neighbors turned
out to beat the woods. It was while
searching the woods that .news was

found washed upon a bar in a stream
five miles below Millwood In Douglass
County this afternoon. The condition
of the remains showed that they had
been in the Water but a short time.
Ford was a married man, aged about
35, and Emily Bogard was a girl of 16.
It" is the, general belief that the couple
started to elope and fearing that cap
ture would result in disgrace to both,
they plunged into a deep pool In the
stream and were drowned.

DENVER, July 12.â Governor Pea
body to-day received a telegram from
Colonel R. B. Frye of Ouray. a veteraq
of the Civil War, saying:
That thev jean get first-class irrigat
ed orange land for from $50 to $100 an
acre is also a surprise to the home
seekers. Colonel Green and Judge Wil
lis, in charge of the display, say that
many people with enough money to
buy small homes will inspect the
orange lands of Butte, Placer, Auburn,
Glenn, Yuba, Sacramento and other
northern counties. The homeseeker in
the Sacramento Vallev exhibit is like
a woman in a department store â there
are so many, articles that look good
that she doesn't know which to choose.
The display offers a variety of agri
cultural opportunities that causes dal
liance on the part of the man who
wants to settle on a small tract, and
they nearly all come to the conclusion
that there is nothing worth while that
cannot be grown on the rich Sacra
mento Valley land.
Trees growing on their booth is a
novelty by which San Luis Obispo and
Monterey counties attract visitors. On

Enough semi-sunshine oozes through
the immense skylights in the roof of
the Palace of Agriculture to give them
life and growth and they stand beauti
fully green and diminutively majestic
on top of the pillarsâ the only trees ac
tually growing. in the big structure.
GROWING TREES DISPLAYED.
But Commissioner Black and his
wife, who .represent these counties,
have gone even further Into the grow
ing-plant scheme of decoration. About
each white pillar of the booth an ivy
is entwining itself and clambering up
ward to reach the pine and the fig. The
living green against the white pillars
is a very artistic decoration. Growing
sword ferns top the columns not occu
pied by the tiny trees. ' .

Grange, culture in the Sacramento
Valley Is a subject of -much inquiry by
Eastern visitors to the fair. The big.
oranges displayed by the Sacramento
Valley Development Association and
the information that they mature in
the valley from four- to six weeks'ear
lier than in any other part of the.'
State, thus. assuring a good price, are
arousing great Interest among pros
pective ourchasers of small farms,
hundreds of whom visit the Sacra
mento Valley and oth^r California
displays. Orange growing Is already
an important Industry In the valley
and is destined to become still greater.
Surprise is manifested by visitors
that such fine .oranges can be grown
in Sacramento and the more northern
counties, such as Butte, Yuba and
Placer. That northern California
grows great quantities of this citrus
fruit of great size and fine quality is
something new to most of the people^
of thÂ» East, though in some cities
Sacramento Valley oranges are well
known.

hall, which extends the full length of
the rear of the building, seats about 300
people. At the first lecture there were
about sevfenty-five people, who dropped
in casually from those coming and go
ing in the outer part of the structure.
They must have said something good
about the pictures, for at the next lec
ture there were double that many peo
ple, including some who had attended
the first one. At the third lecture there
were about the same number, but the
next day the hall was" full at all of
them and it has so ever since
whenever Erwin gave his tri-daily en
tertainment. Many of the views shown
are applauded. Up to date they have
all been of San Francisco, but the whole
State will be embraced. The lectures
will be given during the remainder of
the fair.

worth 55000 have been found upon the
person of Martha Ellyson Sabin, ar
rested, here yesterday with Henry J.
Kendall for a Chicago diamond rob
bery. The woman objected strenuous
ly to being searched, but finally per
mitted the wife of Jailer Benjamin to
search her. Mrs. Benjamin found the
gems in her stockings and corsage.
There are four rings with diamond set
tings. One is worth $300, two are worth
$200 each and there is a small one val
ued at $100. There are also numerous
brooches, pins and other Jewelry with
magnificent diamonds set in them. Ex
perts pronounce them to be worth
nearly $5000. The Jewels answered the
description of some of those stolen in
Chicago. Kendall Is still In jail, being
unable to secure $5000 ball,. but the wo
man Is out on $2500 cash ball. The two
were held on a fugitive warrant' Â¦ To
day, however, Chief of Police Walker
received a telegraphic warrant and an
officer Is now on the way from Chicago.
â¢ Episcopalians throughout California
are preparing for the General Conven
tion of the church, which meets In Bos
ton early in October, and promises to
be decidedly the most sensational gath
ering the American branch of the
Anglican . communion has ever held.
The delegation from the Diocese of Cal
ifornia includes Bishop W. F. Nichols,
metropolitan of the seventh district;
the Rev. Edward L. Parsons of St.
Mark's Church, Berkeley; Rev. F. W.
Clampett, D. D., of Trinity; Archdeacon
J. A. Emery and the Rev. Mardon D.

man, with A. N. Drown, W. A. M. Van
Bokkelen, George E. Butler " and
Charles D. Havens, laymen. The first
alternates are the Rev. C. F. Sanford of
St. John's and Francis Avery. All
the delegates are preparing to be pres
ent unless unforeseen events prevent.
The coming convention will be inter
esting and Important, and its conclu
sions will mark an epoch in church, his
tory. \ The drastic marriage and divorce
canon, which absolutely prohibits the
marriage of divorced persons, will be
passed at this session, a poll of affirma
tive votes by dioceses indicating a large
majority in favor of the legislation. At
the San Francisco convention of 1901
the canon was defeated by the votes of
one diocese only. This action will give
the- Episcopal church a marriage and
divorce canon equally as stringent as
that of the Roman church.
Â¦ The 1 vote by dioceses on a change of
name for. the church indicate that no
substitute will be adopted at Boston.
Whatever legislation is adopted will be
effective only after three years' delay.

SELF-COXFESSED BURGLAR
. A WORRY TO OFFICIALS
Estimates of damages have not yet
been made. The loss will foot up sev
eral thousands of dollars. Mitchell is
the county seat of "Wheeler County.
Locney's store was the first business
building to succumb. Two livery barns
directly in the path of destruction were
carried away. About forty head of
etock had not been recovered and were
drowned. Everything else on the way
down stream was washed away. The
postoffiee, Oakes' mercantile store and
Waterman's general store were out of
the main path of the flood. The stock
cf these places of business was damag
ed to seme extent. The Mitchell Sen-
Ur.el office was ruined by the mud and
debris deposited. Stories of the death
cf Martin Smith and Mrs. Bettman
vary. Both were aged people, close to
the century mark.
The main portion of Mitchell lies in
a narrow canyon. A storm of un
usual severity had raged in the hills
<5uring the afternoon and the inhabi
tants, mindful of the disaster to Hepp
ner of a year ago. betook themselves
to high ground along the side of the
canyon. About 6 o'clock the roar of
th.e approaching wave could be heard,
trrowing louder with its nearer ap
proach. The crash of the great mass
cf -water as it struck the first build
ings was deafening, drowning the
Ehrieks of terror of women and chil
dren as they strove to climb still high
er cut cf harm's way.
Far dawn ahead of the yellow mass
rode a messenger on horseback, warn
ing those still farther down stream of
Impending death. The buildings in the
path of the flood were swept away like
eo much brush. Of over a score
ecarcely a vestige remains, save where
shattered boards and timbers are
caught by trees and brush far below
the town site. The business portion of
Mitchell was not greatly damaged, be
ing built on ground above the reach
of the main force of the torrent. On
the north side all the buildings, some
twâ¬r.ty-â¬ight in all, were carried away.

Disaster of Heppner Is Al

Tragic Experience of That
City Serves as a Warning
OAKLAND, July 12.â One week ago,
on Wednesday evening, L. R. Emery,
residing at 51S Eighteenth street, made
an attack on Miss A. C. Emery, his
seventeen-year-old daughter, whom he
choked into insensibility before his
wife, Mrs. Sarah Emery, and the other
members, of the family could rescue the
girl from her insane parent On the
following day Mrs. Emery swore to a
complaint against her husband, charg
ing him with insanity, but Emery
learned that a warrant had been issued
for his arrest and disappeared.
Sunday night Emery appeared at the
Advent Christian Church on Thirty
third and West streets, where his
daughter was attending service, and
entered the church In search of her.
The appearance of her insane father
terrified the young woman, who fainted
In the. pew, and in the confusion Emery
escaped before an officer could be sum
moned to take him into custody.
This is the second time that Emery
has been arrested oh Â«a charge of in
sanity. About six months ago he was
committed to the State hospital at
Stockton, but was later discharged as
cured. He has a family of four chil
dren, two boys and two girls.
Emery attributes the accusations
that have been made against him to
members of the Advent Christian
Church who are seeking to poison his
daughter's mind against him. He de
clares that he .is not opposed to his
children attending any. house of wor
ship but is bitter against the Advent
ists. He was an inmate of the asylum
at Stockton for four months last year.
Detective Kyte, who made an investi
gation of the affair, says that there is
no truth in the statement that Emery
was armed when he entered the church
and that he created a scene. Accord
ing to the officer the, affair happened
exactly as Emery states.
Emery is 67 years of age, a carpenter
by occupation and resided with his
family at 516 Eighteenth street.
When seen last night he appeared to
be perfectly rational and made the fol
lowing statement:
The allegations tnad>.Â» against mÂ« to the ef
fect that 1 attempted to assault my daughter
la the Advent Christian Church and that I
carried a. revolver at that time are absolutely
lalse. I knew that my daughter would be in
attendance at the services and I went there
with the sole Intention of ascertaining if my
eldest son. who had run away from home, had
been beard from. 1 took a seat nrax the rear
of the church and gpoke to my daughter, who
was sitting abcut ten feet away. Shortly aft
erward I noticed a vacant seat by her side and
eat down "by her. I asked her if O. C. (that is
my boy's name) had communicated with the
family and ehe shook her head. I then asked
if she would step outside with Mrs. Young,
her companion, but she again replied in the
came manner. I then Inquired if she did not
care to see her father again and, receiving the
same headsha&e, I arose .and walked out of
the church. I then went to the home of John
Vertelli. the astrologisC for -whom I have been
working, and slert there that night. I canw
to fc'an Francisco Monday and visited several
friends. This afternoon 1 visited the office
of Mr. Mots and was prepared to give myself
up when the officers came tn. I never made
any attempt to choke my daughter and at no
time committed an assault on any member of
my family.
L. R. Emery, who Is wanted in Oak
land on a charge of insanity, -was ar
rested in this city last evening in the
offices of Moss & Co., 632 Market street,
by Patrolmen E. P. Ruggles and Jack
Tillman. After being booked at the
City Prison he was transferred to the
detention hospital for the insane at the
City Hall and subsequently taken to
Oakland by Detective Kyte of that city.
The police of Oakland have been
searching for Emery for several days
and the local authorities were also
asked to keep a lookout for him. The
warrant charging him with insanity
was sworn to by Emery's wife, who
alleges that he made an attempt to
strangle one of his daughters last
Wednesday, but was prevented from
accomplishing his purpose by ; other
members of the family.
Emery is sa!d to have created con
sternation in the Advent Christian
Church, Twenty-third and West
streets, Oakland, Sunday night by ap
proaching his eighteen-year-old daugh
ter during the service with the inten
tion, it is claimed, of killing her. It
was said that he was armed at the time
with a revolver.
Game Warden Harry Daniels of
Clallam County cannot help but feel
a little proud of the occurrence. To
him the visit of the elk means that the
game protection under his supervision
is a great success. Daniels says the
game is more plentiful in Clallam
County now than for the -.last fifteen
>fars.
SEATTLE, July 12.â A big bull elk
paraded the main streets of Port An
geles the other day. and after chasing
arcund until he had worked up a nice
sweat, jumped into the salt water and
regaled himself with a swim across
the narrow arm of the sound from the
sand pits to the mainland.
The inhabitants of Port Angeles were
surprised to see the elk so friendly and
unafraid, for not for twenty years be
fore had an elk â of the four-footed kind
âbeen so sociable and friendly. A
number of small boys tried to make
up to the visitor from the forest, but
he was rather proud and offish and
continued his inspection of the streets
of the city alone.

months the arm will be as good as befora the
accident.
Dr. Stratton said this afternoon:
OAKLAND, July 12.â George Hoff
man the young hero who, to save the
life of his six-year-old < sister, allowed
the surgeons to strip from his thighs
nearly one hundred square inches of
skin, with which to cover the terrible
burns on her arm and shoulder, to-day
has the satisfaction of knowing that he
has not suffered in vain.
Dr. R. T. Stratton, who performed
the delicate operation of skin grafting,
announced this afternoon that the girl
was practically out of danger, and
would undoubtedly recover. I
The wounds on the boy's' limbs are
yet very painful, and he still walks on
crutches. He givea little heed to the
pain, however, for he now knows that
through his suffering his sister will
be restored to health. This morning he
said:
I don't see why I should be called a hero
for letting the doctor take the skin from my
Ipss, wh?n it- was to save my sister's lite.
Anybody would do that much for his sister.
Of course, the places where the skin is off are
pretty sore, but I'll be all right before long,
and as long as Alice is going to get well I
don't care about myself.

of even the most energetic of us. A little
luncheon lor two or" three, in Â¦ the garden, a
little ride under the pale stars or a short
spin into the country in a smart "chou-chou

some of our home-staying society folk resting.
Many are planning to visit the World's Fair'

REAL ESTATE TRANSACTIONS.
SUMMERTIME TEAS
The shifting of this money will ne
cessitate the temporary abandoning of
the work on the scenic boulevard which
was to have been pushed along as
fast as possible. This driveway Is to
connect Oakland and Haywards with
a splendid road which will equal any of
the famous drives in the State for
beauty of scenery.
There Is also in the hands of the
County Treasurer the sum of 513,000 as
unpaid salary of Assessor Daiton. HÂ«
has been unable to draw any salary
for the past three years, pending liti
gation over commissions on tax collec
tions. It is likely that this money will
aJso be transferred from the salary
fund into the general fund for current
expenses and in this way all deficits
will be overcome.
By transferring funds from the mines
and foothills road fund to the general
fund, the Board of Supervisors has
averted the threatened shortage in the
county's cash. The work upon these
roads will be allowed to go for an
other year and about 580.000 is thus
made available for general purposes.
By this means many claims will be paid
-which would otherwise have waited
long. *-;:Â¦ Â¦<Â¦Â¦

The compromise having been effected
out of court the contestants made no
appearance to-day and only the widow
and her daughter were present with
her", attornej-s. Testimony in regard
to the â¢wills, however, was necessary to*
phow that the first will had not been
destroyed by fraud and that the one
presented for probate was made to re
place it.
1016 BroadwJto\ July 12.
The will of the late EWbrizio Xigro,
disposing of property valued at $500,
000. was admitted to probate to-day.
The threatened contest has been avert
ed by the widow paying 53000 to the
contestants. According to the testi
mony, given this morning by the widow
end daughter. Attorney Charles F.
Hanlon of San Francisco and Domenlco
and Prancisco Albert!, who had been
named as executors and trustees under
the will, had held. Nigro' s will Cor near
ly two years and that only after Nigro
had made another revoking it did they
consent to have the first testament de
stroyed. After Nigro's. death they filed
a copy of the will they had retained so
long and threatened a contest but a
compromise was arranged.
Nigro was owner of the Poodle Dog
restaurant property in San Francisco,
and other valuable realty, all of which
is divided equally between the widow,
Ellen Nigro, and an adopted daughter
Madeleine. Both widow and daughter
Ftated on the stand to-day that Nigro
had often tried to get the will he had
made from Hanlon but.. never could.
"When it was finally destroyed Hanlon
took it to the Nigro residence at Ninth
and Center streets in this city and
burned it. He refused to let Nigro have
It but insisted upon destroying it him
self.
According to the statement of Reuben
H. Lloyd, who, with Judge Sullivan
and Attorneys Allen & Walsh, is repre
senting the widow and daughter, the
two Albertis were virtually made the
owners of the property and would have
been entitled to endless fees. Hanlon
was their attorney. A boast credited to
the Albertis, that Mrs. Nigro would get
little of the money after Nigro's death,
vas what first caused Mrs. Nigro to
become uneasy, she testified, and she
th*Â»n began to urge her husband to get
the will which he had signed and let
her see it

Johnson said he had been calling on
relatives and had gone to First street
and Broadway to wait for a train to
San Francisco. "While seated on a
bench he got into conversation with a
stranger, a man of twenty years or so.
Johnson wanted to find a retiring place
and the affable young man Invited him
to go to the house upstairs. The police
think a sandbag was used, as the sea
man's head was badly contused where
the weapon had struck him. A good
description of the thug was given to
the detectives. ?
To be sandbagged and robbed of $52
was the experience of Emil Johnson, a
sailor residing at 27 Main street. San
Francisco, while he was visiting this
afternoon in Oakland.
The seaman was decoyed into a room
at the Overland House, First street and
Broadway. As he stepped in front of
his guide Johnson was felled by a ter
rific blow on the head. He dropped
senseless to the floor. When the mari
ner revived' he was minus his purse
and coin. The money represented his
earnings for a short time at a ooai
dealer's place in Sausalito.
As soon as he had sufficiently recov
ered, Johnson left the house and no
tified the police. Detectives Kyte and
Shorey are looking for the man who
took the sailor in tow.

The Iron Mountain Copper Company,
operating an extensive smelting plant
at Keswlck, to-day completed the pur
chase of fifty-five acres of water front
land, near Martinez, as a site for its
works, which will be located on the
newly acquired property as soon as the
removal from Shasta County can be ef
fected. . .
The new site is on Bullshead Point, a
mile and a half east of Martinez. It
comprises a portion of the 140 acre
tract owned by Charles Ettz of the
Bullshead Oil Refinery, which is oper
ated on the land. [ The price paid for
the fifty-flve acres is understood to be
about 560,000. ~._
This purchase includes about one-half
of the water frontage. in the tract. Be
cause of the deep water at the point
the site was selected. Vessels can easi
ly be handled there, as there is fully
thirty feet of depth available at high
tide. ;
According to the information availa

Professor Moses in concluding called
attention to the system of electing rep
resentatives in vogue in the East,
where the people have learned the
value of returning tried men to repre
sent them year after year. The West,
he declared, has not learned that it is
making a grave mistake by continually
shifting the personnel of its representa
tives, so that now much power is
wasted.
The question of electing:. United States Sen
ators by direct vote of the people has been
raised often lately and fome attempts have
beea ms.de to secure an amendment of the
Constitution. I do not approve of the pro
posed change, because I think in the end that
it all amounts to the same thing. We have
always been able to trust the men we elect
to represent us with the power delegated to
them to elect good and efficient Senators. The
Senate is always an admirable bod?, although
It often occurs that many of Its members are
merely rich men. It seems to roe that the
spirit of the whole constitution would be
changed if this one change is made.
I wish also to speak of the habit that has
lately sprung up of instructing our delegates
to perform certain things for us when they go
to Congress or to conventions. I don't believe
the founders of this Government ever intended
that it should be done. The representatives
are chosen by the people for a specific purpose,
with full power to act, and it is not for us to
trammel their free agency.
Professor Bernard Moses of the his
tory department of the University of
California believes that the system of
electing United States Senators is as
good as any that could be "devised and
he is not in sympathy with the agita
tion in favor of electing Senators by
direct vote of the people.
Professor Moses also disapproves of
the plan of instructing representatives
to Congress or conventions, on the
ground that the system is a departure
from the policy followed by the found
ers of the republic.
These views Professor Moses ex
pressed to-day before his class in
"Government" at the summer session
of the university. He said:

it's all mine."
He swung his lasso and it settled
over his adversary's head. For a

permitted itself to be roped in. .
"He'll 'go fine barbecued." remark

Law suit Involving Ownership of $300,

Court.- : ':"'Â¦
BANK AND LAXD COMPANY
STRUGGLE FOR BIG PRIZE
NAPA, July 12. â The case of Simp
son Finnell vs. the James H. Goodman
& Co. Bank began this morning
in the Superior Court before Judge Ges
ford. The case promises to be the most
important ever tried in Napa County
and involves financial transactions
covering a period of fifteen years be
tween John Finnell, a prominent
rancher of Napa and Tehama counties,
and George E. Goodman, formerly
president of the James H. Goodman &
Co. Bank.
In August, 1903, shortly aftor
George E. Goodman severed his con
nection with the bank, he paid to the
bank $307,000 and he claims at that
time. the officers of the bank assured
him that he -would receive for this
sum a proportionate part of 4500
shares of the capital stock of the Fin
nell Land Comapny then held by the
bank. Subsequently the bank refused
to turn over any of this stock to Good
man, claiming that the $307,000 paid
to the bank was for money wrong
fully withdrawn in the course of the
Finnell transactions. Goodman since
assigned his claim to Simpson Fin
nell, a son of John Finnell, and
suit was brought to recover 2S71
shares of the Finnell Land Company
stock, this being the alleged number
Goodman was entitled to for $307,000.
The ' Finnell Land Company, capital
ized for $650,000, is divided into 6500
shares^and owns some 16,000 acres of
rich land In Tehama County.
The case will be hotly contested and
prominent attorneys appear on both
sides. The plaintiff is represented by
Judge C. W. Slack, C. S. Wheeler, Bush
Finnell and C. E. Trower, and Garret

Manager Briggs announced that

The subject of the recommendations
for appointment of Jurors to act In the
departments of agriculture, viticul
ture, horticulture, mining, forestry and
education at the St. Louis Exposition
and to award prizes was discussed. On
motion of Senator Perkins a committee
was named, consisting of W. II. Mills,
Arthur R. Briggs and General N. P.
Chipman to suggest names for Jurors.
Whereas. The Oriental market demands a
strong flour and the flour exported from Cali
fornia would be more esteemed and would
bring higher priors If it contained a larger
percentage of gluten than can now be ob
tained from our wheat;, and.
Whereas. It is believed that we are rapidly
apptoaching a period when home consump
tion and the demand for flour In the Orient
will require all of our wheat, it is important
that the quality be brought up to the highest
po-slble standard, both for domestic use and
Â«Â« meet the demands of the foreign trade. To
th* end that California farmers may maintain
their position in competition with wheat
pnwn in any other State, it is
Resolved, That a. committee of five, of which
the president of the board shall be chairman,
be appointed to confer with the manufacturers
of flour and with the farmers In this State
S'ld with the agricultural college of the Uni
versity of California, with directions to in
quire into the facts related to the question of
growing ar.d marketing wheat in California,
and to report fully the results of its investi
gations.
A preamble and resolutions were
adopted yesterday on motion of Man
ager Arthur Jt. Briggs, at a meeting of
the California State Board of Trade,
for the appointment of a committee of
five to confer with the manufacturers
of flour and with the farmers of this
State and with the Agricultural Col 7
lege of the University of California,
The duty of the committee will be to
investigate the growing and marketing
of wheat in California,
The action was the outgrowth of an
inquiry conducted yesterday by the
State Board of Trade into an emer
gency that has arisen. The principal
speaker was Horace Davis, who, from
the standpoint of a practical milling
man, gave much valuable Information.
Davis said positively that it is now
necessary to Import wheat from South
Dakota and from Kansas into Califor
nia In large quantities to supply the
necessary blend that Is required to give
the California milled flour sufficient
gluten. The California wheat, so said
Mr. Davis, now runs too much to
starch and too little to gluten for
flour making. Starch makes fat, glu
ten makes muscle. Greater strength
is needed in California wheat.
Others interestingly discussed the
wheat situation, among them W. H.
Mills. T. C. Friedlander, Craigie Sharp,
President N. P. Chipman and United
States Senator Perkins. It was agreed
that something ought to be done for
the good of the State. Formerly Cali
fornia wheat was adequate to all de
mands upon it, so it was represented.
The farmers have fallen into the way
of raising club wheat, which has its
advantages, but the grain is devoid of
the necessary percentage of gluten.
Mr. Mills suggested that it might be
possible to hybridize wheat. General
Chipman read a letter from Professor
Shaw of the University of California.
It appeared that the importance of hav
ing the proper kind of wheat raised
was understood by practical men in
and out of the University of California.
President Chipman appointed as a com
mittee to take up the entire matter and
report: Horace Davis, Professor Shaw
of the University of California. T. C.
Friedlander and Arthur R. Briggs.
General Chipman was also made the
chairman of the committee by the
terms of the resolution, which is as
follows:
Whtrrai, It haÂ» come to the knowledge of
the California State Board of Trade that cer
tain descriptions of wbe&t grown in this State
are deficient In gluten content, and that some
of the flourmllls of tha State arc now bring
ing wheat from Kansas and Dakota to be
mixed with the California product In order to
ralee the grade of flour manufactured here;
and.
Mary L Parker, formerly Mary
Ohamplin, one of the belles of Tehama
County, end known in Ban Francisco
foeiety. appeared at noon yesterday in
Judge Troutt's court and obtained an
interlocutor} decree of diverce from
Frederick W. Parker on the ground of
villful neglect. They were married at
the Champlin home, near Red Bluff,
or> March 4. 1S97. Parker is now at
New Brunswick, N. J. Two years ago
fc* sent his wife home to her mother
and since then has forwarded only $20.
Th*> suit for divorce, charging neglect,
was filed a year ago. Parker then
? r.tered a general denial to her charge
and expressed a willingness to support
h?r, but he did not appear in court
yesterday to contest the action.
A stipulation was filed by which Mrs.
Parker waived alimony and secured
custody of their little daughter until
the is S years old. At the latter age
the child is to go to the father and re
main with him until she is 14 and then
Fhe will be permitted to choose her
own pruardian.
Charlotte Madden yesterday filed suit
for divorce against Henry August Mad
den. She says they - were married by
civil contract !n 1SS6 and again by a
minister in Oakland in February of this
year. She accuses him of extreme cru
elty and drunkenness and alleges that
Tvhile he earns $20 a week he has at
times limited her to 25 cents a day for
the support of herself and two chil
dren, one 6 years old and the other IS
month*. She pays that, besides beating
her. he compelled her to care for his
horse and clean out the stable. The
wife asks fcr $40 a month alimony.
Other suits for divorce were filed by
Kmma Jaeobson against Isaac Jacob

<Jehrcke. desertion; E. J. Knutson
against C. Knutson, cruelty; J. W.

JosÂ«=phine Kent against It. W. Kent.
In the last case the husband is said to
\>e a physician and the wife charges
ihat he broke down the door to their
room six days after their child was
born. She declares that he owns lands
in Tuolomne County worth $10,000.
Divorces were granted yesterday by
â¢lu<1fre Graham to Grace Page from
William Page, desertion; by Judge
Hunt to Anna Laura Freudenberg from
Jlenry Freudenberg, desertion: by
Judge Kerrigan to Archibald W. Char
man from Mary Charman, desertion;

The vectry of the Church of the
Advent over which the Rev. Father
Parrish, so successfully presided for
upward of four years, lost no time in
selecting: a successor to its pulpit, and
as soon as the canonical requirements
of the Jurisdiction are complied with
the Rev. Charles Newton Lathrop, A.
B., will be formally called to the rec
torship.
As required. Bishop Nichols was in
vited to attend the meeting at which
the choice of a new rector was to be
made, but did not accept the invita
tion, which act on the part of the
Bishop was considered tantamount to
a consent to any choice that the con
gregation might decide to make. No
opposition to Mr. Lathrop having ma
terialized in any quarter, he will be
duly notified and at an early day in
stalled rector.
The new minister has acted as as
sistant to Father Parrish for three
years and Is fully conversant with the
field. He is a son of Dr. H. G. Lath
rop, a former rector of the church
and later the organizer and founder j
of the .Church of the Advent. Eafet !

Harvard and studied theology at the
Western Theological Seminary in Chi- j

now called him to be its priest. i
Jacob Eppinger. was unable to appear
in the courtroom yesterday , and the
trial of the case was further delayed,
to the apparent gratification of all but
Judge and jury. The attorneys on both
Bides prof e6S to be anxious to finish the
case as soon as possible, but they wel
comed an opportunity to spend another
day in reading over; the transcripts of
testimony. Whether the illness is real
or feigned, it came at a most oppor
tune time for _ the defense, as the at
torneys for the grain operator have had
little time in which to prepare their
case since the prosecution rested last
Friday afternoon.
When the case was called yesterday
morning Judge Lawlor. announced that
he had authorized Dr. Gallwey to con
sult with Eppinger's physician. Dr.
Whitney, and send him a report before
10 o'clock. No report was received, but
shortly after 10 o'clock Dr. Gallwey
communicated with Judge Lawlor by,
telephone, saying that Dr. Whitney was
unable to accompany him to Ep
pinger's residence and with the consent
of all parties" he would. proceed, alone.
Later Attorney Ach received a.tele
phone message from Joseph Eppinger
to the effect that Dr. Gallwey had dis
covered new complications and advised
that the defendant Temain- away from
the courtroom for the morning at least.
In the absence of any written or
direct oral report Judge 'Lawlor ad
journed court until 2 o'clock in the af
ternoon. Before the hour for reopen
ing court arrived Dr. Gallwey appeared
before Judge Lawlor and made an oral
report, supplemented by a written one.
These Judge Lawlor regards as privi
leged communications and he refuses to
give any information regarding them.
It is evident, however, that Dr. Gall
wey does not look upon Eppinger as a
very sick man, as Judge Lawlor, after
i receiving his report, granted a further
| continuance of the case until 10 o'clock
this morning. He. would not say
\ whether the diagnosis of Dr. Gallwey
i agreed with that of Dr. Whitney, but
| was positive. that the case will go on
I to-day.

At 4:30 to-day the wedding of Miss
Mary Bright, daughter of Mrs. James
Maxwell .Wallace, to Lieutenant Gil
bert A. McElroy will take place at the
Swedenborglan church, corner of
Washington and Lyon streets.
Stunning Susan Bixby was wed yes
terday to Dr. Ernest Bryant in the
land of orange blossoms." The wires
were kept hummlr? yesterday, bear
ing messages of congratulation to the
fair bride and the thrice lucky groom.
The ceremony took place in the pres
ence of a few. friends at the ranch of
Frederick Bixby, her brother.
Miss Bessie Palmer of Oakland was
in attendance upon the bride, and
Burely must have been a captivating
honor maid.
After the return of the young people
Mrs. Howard mere will give a recep
tion in their honor.
Miss Norcross, the daughter of Mrs.
D. C. Norcross, is a winsome maid,
chic and pretty. And not less favored
is the'groom, who, as the son of Mr.
and Mrs. John L. Howard of Oakland,
is a popular chap, equally well known
in his business and social relations.
Yesterday Â¦ morning at . .9 o'clock
Miss Edith Norcross became the bride
of John L. Howard Jr., Rev. Burr M.
Weeden of St. Luke's officiating.
Miss Jean Howard and her brother,
Harry Howard, attended the happy
couple and D. C. Norcross gave the
bride away. An informal reception fol
lowed the church ceremony at the
bride's home. Mr. and Mrs. Howard
will enjoy a sojourn at Tahoe before
taking up their temporary residence
in . the Howard mansion - on Vernon
Heights, Oakland.
The groom was attended by his
brothers, T. T. Johnson and A. S.
Johnson. After the. ceremony a re
ception was held, to -tvhich 150 invi
tations had been issued.
A charming home wedding occurred
last evening, when pretty Grace Pln
ney became the bride of Arthur "VV.
Johnson at the home of the bride's
parents, Dr. and Mrs. H. Pinney. The
ceremony was performed by Dr.
Hemphill of the Calvary Presbyterian
Church in the presence of close
friends and relatives.
Thft bride, wearing ah exquisite
gown of white crepe de chine and rose
point, was attended by two college
friends, Miss Queen Lamberson and
Miss Anna Springer of Palo Alto, both
of r whom wore smart frocks of white.
The bride wore a soft veil of tulle and
carried a shower bouquet of orange
blossoms.

THE city of Tacoma, through the Tacoma Ledger,
asserts that it is "the home city of the North
west." It challenges; by means of ah array" of
figures, the cities of Portland, Seattle and Spokane to
contest this claim. To be the city of homes is surely
something very desirable. # A stable . population is there
by insured and a high degree of civic pride, relatively,
ought ;to result from stability. .There is little doubt that
the cities of the Northwest will at once take up the con
troversy that is thus opened" and the outcome will- be
that the attentive observer will learn much that will in
fluence him in the choice of, a home if he has any desire
to locate in the Northwest. " From this point ' of view
there is a business interest concerned that will ;lend
keenness and piquancy to the men who shaH take up the

THE EYE STONEâ Subscriber, City.
What is known as the eye stone is
taken from a species of small shell fish
found principally on the South Ameri
can coast. It is the mouthpiece or
front door, so to speak, of the shell
and Is shaped with a convex surfaee
on one side and Is flat on the other.
Humboldt.Mhe great traveler, found
this little stone used by the South
Americans to remove foreign sub
stances from the eye. It is still col
lected and exported for that purpose.
When put under the lid of the eye the
stone is moved by the motion of tha
eyeball and little particles which It
touches adhere to it and may be re
moved with it.

A Coroner's jury, rising in its wisdom to the considera
tion of a problem important to the community, has de
cided that no one was to blame for the horrifying death
of an aged, paralytic patient who was recently trampled
to death by a lunatic inmate of the City and County
HospitalÂ«Â» If the logic of this jury would not permit of
censure the marvel is why somebody was not com
mended for the tragedy. Surely serious blame must
attach to some one for such an incident in a public in
stitution.
The Legislature of Louisiana has decreed that all

it. Louisiana will probably find â¢ as we have that the

SETTING ON FIREâ A. S., "Wrights
Station, Cal. In the ordinary accepta
tion of the phrase "To set the Thames
on fire" means "to cut a figure in the
world" , or "to become distinguished for
ability." It is sometimes used as a term
of derision. The origin of the phrase is
probably from a corruption of the old
English word temse, a sieve or boltex â
the suggestion being that a very dili
gent and energetic workman might, by
his rapid work overheat the wood'ffTk
of the bolter and so set It on fire. To
"eet the temse on fire" to the modern
phrase "to set the Thames on fire" waa
an easy transition.
Flogged England's Primate.
An, amusing reminiscence of a flog
ging he once gave the Archbishop of
Canterbury was recalled by the Rev.
Canon Bury, rector of Harleston, at
Northampton, yesterday. - Commending
a recent speech of the Primate on
missionary work, ; he incidentally ob
served that he was at school with the
Archbishop. Randall Davidson was one
of the pupils of his (Canon Bury's)
father, and he could not recall that the
futtfre Archbishop was remarkable
for ; anything save his inordinate
Impudence. Though himself con
spicuous for his exceptional for
bearance, â¢ on one occasion 1 young
Davidson provoked him beyond all pa
tience, and he therefore turned on him
and gave him a very severe thrashing.
The future Archbishop did not take it
'lying down." On the contrary,. he at
once complained, and so got him Into
trouble, and, not content with that, he
complained to his own parents, and got
Canon . Bury's father into trouble.
Thus it was that their mutual remini
scences" were not altogether pleasing.
But Canon Bury firmly believedâ if he
were an Archbishop he would say he
was profoundly convincedâ that the
thrashing did the Archbishop a power
of good. It was the foundation of the
character he afterward . displayed ' of
tactj and caution and for
hia , superiors which had led in a great
measure to his elevation to the prim

Anszvers to Queries.
A RECENT report from Chicago says that hun
dreds of applicants for positions as teachers in
the public schools in that city are engaged in a
frantic struggle either, to put on flesh or to work it off
so as to fit themselves for a beauty test. The report
goes on to say: "A rule of the Board of Education that
applicants shall satisfy the medical examiners that they
are of 'proper size, height and weight' and the announce
ment that candidates will be graded according to their
physical development has led to the tissue building
struggle."
It appears the trouble originated in a report from the
"Child Study Laboratory" that experimental investiga
tion and research have demonstrated that mentality and
physical beauty are closely related; or as one of the au
thorities puts it: "The healthy person develops symmetri
cally. Beauty and brains go together. In the test speci
mens it is found that a fine mind generally goes with
a well-proportioned body."
At the time the rule was announced there were upward
of 650 young women enrolled as applicants for academic
examination. Naturally enough the springing of the rule
caused a flutter and a splutter. Some of the applicants
are said to be "scrawny" and others are said to be
"fat," and as they have but little time to fit themselves
for the test of comeliness, they have one and all had to
get to work vigorously, one class eating patent breakfast
foods' and the other doing overtime in massage rooms
and sweat baths.
Out of the agitated and agitating discussion resulting
from the new rule we learn that up to this time the Chi
cago' Board of Education nas had to accept teachers of
a low grade of beauty because there were not enough
beautiful ones to fill all vacancies. With the present
large numbers of applicants, however, it is believed the
board can fill the schools with teachers not one of whom
will fall below the second of the three grades of physical
perfection into which they are to be classified. It is
quite probable the rule will work some benefit for Chi
cago and that in the course of a few years the higher
beauty grade of school teachers in that city may ap
proximate the average standard of teachers in San Fran
cisco, and if so the enterprising authorities of the Child
Study Laboratory will deserve a vote of thanks from the
community.
BEAUTY AND BRAINS.
A few days since a woman of this city, driven to the
last extremity of desperate illness, pleaded vagrancy
that she might be sentenced to the County Jail and there
receive ministration that had been denied to her in the
City and County Hospital. The unfortunate's request for
imprisonment was granted by a Police Judge and the
people of San Francisco must accept her as a humiliating
object lesson of the inability of the municipality to per
form one of the primary duties of its organization.
During the ninetv-four years .of its
existence the American Board has com
missioned 137 physicians;" thirty-eight
of these physicians were ordained men,
and twenty of them were women. At
the present time fifteen of our twenty
missions have one or more physicians
on their staff, numbering in all forty,
of whom twelve are also ordained men
and twelve are women. By the latest
enumeration there were connected with
these several missions of the board
forty-two dispensaries and twenty-nine
hospitals, as follows: In Turkey, eight
dispensaries, six hospitals; in India and
Ceylon, sixteen dispensaries and eleven
hospitals; in China,, tfn dispensaries
and eight hospitals; in Africa, seven
dispensaries and three hospitals, and in
Japan, one dispensary and a mission
ary physician in one hospital. By the
last report there were a little over 230,
000 patients treated the previous year
in these various institulons. This med
ical work is perhaps more\nearly self
supporting than any branch of the mis
sionary- enterprise. For although the
poor are treated In multitudes of cases
without any charge, yet in other cases
those who are able to make payment
either In the form of a fee, or of a gift
out of gratitude for the good they have
received. Many of these hospitals are
entirely self-supporting, and some of
them, like the one in Madura City,
have been furnished with good build
ings by the free offerings of natives,
only a few of whom have as yet pro
fessed the Christian faith. The total
cost of this medical branch of the mis
sionary service to'the American Board,
aside from the salaries of the American
physicians who are In charge, has been
not far from $12,000 a year. â American

"You go to the trouble and expense

lowing letter:
"United Railroads of San Francisco:

A Woman's Time Schedule.
Nile tourists will be delighted with
the results of Mr. Legrain's labors at
Karnak. It Is rear restoration on
which he Is engaged. He has with
him an army of fellahs, who, under
his direction work as the ancients did,
without mechanical appliances, lifting
enormous blocks on inclined planes of
sand. In a short period he will have
finished .his task of replacing the
columns of the Hypostyle HalL
Meanwhile, at Karnak, workmen are
making fresh discoveries daily. From
the black waters of the Nile recently
one of them fished up a beautiful
statuette of Isis nursing Horus, a
superb specimen of the finest eight
eenth dynasty art. Another interest
ing find was a seated statue of a scribe
of the. twenty-second dynasty, carved
in alabaster and as clear as wax. On
the back of this figure is a list of
kings, which Mr. Legrain says will
clear up much that is mysterious in
this period of Egyptian history. An
other unique discovery, made about
the same time, was that of the orig
inal model of the famous statue of
Rameses II, now in the museum at
Turin. It is half life size, exquisitely
carved in green basalt, and in perfect
condition. It is a matter of congratu
lation that all these relics of ancient
Egypt, instead of being scattered far
and wide, will be deposited in the
museum at Cairo.. Spacious and airy
and admirably arranged as the new
building is, it will soon need to be en
larged if treasures continue to pour In
as they have during the last twelve
months.
They come from Thebes, that city
whose temples and monuments, even in
their ruin and desolation, reveal as
nothing else does the glories of ancient
Egyptian civilization. When Ptolemy
Soter II, about SO B. C, decreed the de
struction of the city, the priests of the
great Temple of Amon, in their despair,
collected all their most precious works
of art and buried them underground*.
Mr. Legrain, who has for a long time
been engaged in the restoration of the
fallen columns of the Hypostyle Hall
of Karnak, found two years ago some
fine statues lying under the Nile sand
and mud in a stretch of ground about
100 yards square which had no build
ings upon it. It was just such a spot
as the priests would have been likely
to choose for concealing their treasures.
The extensive excavations begun on
this same spot in the latter half of
December; 1903, seem to fully justify
this supposition. Since that date some
thing like 140 statues or statuettes have
been here recovered. For over 2000
years the waters of the Nile have
risen over them with each recurring
season, but though this has destroyed
the paint and loosened the gold leaf,
no injury has been done to the beauti
ful carving on diorite,- granite, alabas
ter, green basalt or blue slate. Sir Wil
liam Garstin, Under Secretary of State
for Public Works in^ Egypt, chanced to
be at Karnak when some of the best of
them were brought to light, and or
dered their immediate removal to Cairo
lest some wily dealer, aware of their
great value, might tempt the workmen
to purloin them. The work of arrang
ing and labeling these precious acquisi
tions has been postponed until the re
turn to Egypt of Mr. Quibell, one of
the curators of the Museum, who is
now at St. Louis looking after some
specimens of Egyptian art that were
6ent to the World's Fair.
CAIRO. June 14.â Unnoticed and com
paratively unknown, there now are ly
ing at the new Museum of Antiquities
here over a hundred recently unearthed
statues and statuettes, the results of
one of the richest discoveries yet made
of ancient Egyptian works of art. The
specimens range from the fifth
dynasty to the Graeco-Roman period
and their value is greatly enhanced by
the fact that they are all in an ex
cellent state of preservation. Fresh
accessions to the collection are con
stantly arriving.
Great Find of Antiques*
The Athenaeum, the venerable and
dignified English literary review, is al
most as much of an institution in its
way ss the Times, and there has been
a great deal of interest in the fact that
the weekly recently reached its 4000th
number. It was founded in 1S28 by a
writer named Buckingham, who finally
became member of Parliament for
Sheffield and who sold his periodical to
the grandfather of Sir Charles Dilke,
who is the present proprietor, for $2500.
The Athenaeum is by no means pat
ronizing or over-indulgent In its review
of new books and in the last number
the editor sets forth some of his prin
ciples In the matter of literary criti
cism. He denies intentional severity,
but says:
"Immortality is bo frequently and
rashly promised to the writer of to
day that such praise has almost be
come a farce and it is necessary to re
mind readers that restraint in expres-
Eion does not mean disparagement, nor
a high standard a personal grudge. We
are as ready as any," he goes on, "to
Â¦welcome the new man without regard
to cliques or coteries."
The success of the moment in this
country as far as romances are con
cerned is undoubtedly Winston
Churchill's "The Crossing." Fully
twice as many copies were subscribed
for in advance as in the case of "The
Crisis," and the new novel is being
largely ordered by the trade. Of course
this is chiefly due to the reputation
which Mr.'ChurchilT has made in this
country. There is no doubt, however,
that the great demand for "The Cross
ing" over here is owing partly to the
fact that a good many people in this
country Btill believe that Its author is
the English Winston.
It Is hard, as Dr. Conan Doyle may
find out before long, to be both a nov
elist and a statesman. Hall Caine has
managed to combine the two roles
pretty comfortably hitherto, but of late
he has toad to slight the second. Writ-
Ing "The Prodigal Son" took it out of
Mr. Caine so much that he had to go
to the Riviera to recuperate and re
cently the correcting of his proofs has
kept the author bo busy that he hasn*t
had time to appear in the Manx Legisla
ture. His constituents have been pa
tient up to now, but they are becoming
rather restive, for they say that Ram
sey, the district in Man which Mr.
Caine represents, Is practically disen
franchised.
Some day there will be another Im
portant work relating to Sir Henry M.
Stanley, but it is likely to be many
years before it Is published. It seems
that the explorer left behind him not
only a goodly amount of interesting
material concerning himself. In the
form of diaries and letters, but also
documents of ho little historical Im
portance. 'Moet of the matter, how
ever, is of such a character as to
make It impossible that It should ap
pear in print during tha lives of the
persons with whom it is concerned.

Literary Gossip of London.
It was -necessary in the cases of the
Misses Hall to trace their ancestry un
mistakably to an Indian parent. The
romance that has developed began
when their great-great-grandfather
came to America as a French voyageur.
Thomas Condray was a member of a
wealthy, aristocratic French family.
His health failed early In life and the
.trip to America was advised by physi
cians and finally agreed to by the
alarmed parents. He came with the
view of returning to France after a few
months, but a beautiful Cherokee maid
en interrupted his plans. He paid court
to her, married and ever afterward
lived in America with his Indian wife
and children. Through Florida he had
drifted into Georgia, and there met the
Cherokee girl, whose blood still courses
sufficiently in the veins of these two
St. Louis young women to, entitle them
to equal rights with the full-blood
tribesmen of to-day.
The ancestry was trac*d directly by
the Dawes Commission, and upon their
investigation of the alleged rights of
the Misses Hall was established their
title to the land. They have 600 acres
of as valuable land as is included in the
domain of the five tribes. The young
women are but one-sixteenth Indian
blood.â St. Louis Globe-Democrat.
A romance .that has come down
through several centuries has recently
developed as the result of the Dawes
Commission awarding allotments of
valuable land to two St. Louis young
women, the Misses Jessie Mae and
Blanche Hall.
Valuable Indian Ancestry.
Mr. Williams, who is from the first American State
that repudiated its debts, may as well be informed that if
the South is violating the - constitution -the North will
enforce it, though his constituents the North of
every dollar they owe to its merchants and manufac
turers.
After the bloviant effusion over the v South it is amus
ing that- Mr. Williams does not see the humiliation of
his section that is in the admission that it is dependent
on the despised North, for its merchandise and manu
factures. The Southern head seems to need soaking,
as Mills of Texas once advised. The / Democratic posi
tion, as stated by. Mr.^ Williams, is, "If you don't let us
violate the constitution, we won't pay our debts."
The Call said that the opening speech pf the Demo
cratic National Convention would, of necessity, be a
nagging criticism of what the Republican party has
done. It has had to do things. It has had charge of the
Government, by controlling the executive department or
Congress, for forty-four years, except during two years
of Mr. Cleveland's second administration, when the De
mocracy had Congress and the Presidency, and became
responsible for the Government. Now, a party in power
has to administer the Government, and of course has to
do things. In the two years of Democratic control one
thing only was done. Mr. Cleveland protected the pub
lic credit. He forced the repeal of the Sherman act,
and he restrained his party from radical silver legisla
tion. But he did this against his party, and it repudiated
and spat upon him.
Mr. Williams is leader of the minority in the House,
and has sat silent while the Democratic side hissed
Cleveland's name. -It is amazing now that, in a keynote
speech to a Democratic National Convention, the ouly
public act in forty-four years claimed to the credit of
the party, is one which it repudiated, execrated and de
famed 1 Every other act in our public history in that
period has been the fruit of Republican policy. Mr.
Williams addressed himself to a nagging and rather
small smart criticism of that record.
The most striking part of hrs speech is the reference
to the disfranchisement of the negro in the South. He
said: "Disfranchisement of a negro in Mississippi
lor ignorance is a horrible thing; disfranchisement
of a white man in Massachusetts or Connecticut is a part
of New England education." Mark now that sneer at
New England. It reminds one of the piping times of
slavery, when Bob Toombs was calling all Northern men
"mudsills," and declaring that. he would call the roll of
his slaves at the foot of Bunker Hill monument.
Mr. Williams knows the difference between the ' edu
cational qualifications in the ballot laws in the North and
those in the South. He knows that in the Southern con
stitutions the "grandfather" clause provides that no
unqualified voter shall cast a ballot unless his grand
father voted. He knows that this clause is intended to
unconstitutionally disfranchise the negroes, whose
grandfathers were slaves, and at the same time permit
the densely ignorant "mean whites" to vote, though they
don't know "B" from bullsfoot.
Now, note what follows, remembering his sneer at
New England and the North. Threatening that if the
Republican party enforce" the constitution in respect to
counting disfranchised negroes in the basis of repre
sentation the South will retaliate, he said:
"The mercantile class would be the first to suffer,. but
as they owe debts to the North and buy from the North
and as nearly everything they sell is manufactured in the
North, they would not be alone in their suffering."
Which means of course that if the constitution is en
forced they will repudiate the debts they owe in the
North.
MR. WILLIAMS of Mississippi was put forward
by the Democratic National Committee to make
the keynote speech at St. Louis and answer Mr.
Root s speech made at Chicago. This duty was â¢ per
formed by Mr. Williams under circumstances somewhat
unfavorable, due to lack of presence and voice, and more
to lack of attention in the body he was addressing.
Only once did he get from his audience a response
effervescent with enthusiasm. When he denied Republi
can instrumentality in securing the gold standard^ he
claimed that it was established "by the dogged persist
ence and indomitable will of Grover Cleveland." : The
mention of the ex-President's name brought the first
hearty, human and unrepressed expression of feeling.
The same party that in 1896 had called him a thief, in
terms, had accused him of fattening his estate on the
misfortunes of his country, and that has since refused
a place for his portrait in its national, state and county
conventions, and has in every way sought to destroy his
fame, mutilate his record and has even defamed his
family and lied about his domestic life, stood up and
cheered and demonstrated for a considerable fraction of
an hour when his name was mentioned.
After this it was entirely appropriate that Mr Williams
proceeded to praise McKinley, though every one who
heard him knew that, were McKinley living, the Missis
sippi fire-eater would have been denouncing him. But
in order to get a blow at Roosevelt he accused him of
abandoning McKinley 's policy "in twenty respects," and
then proceeded to praise that policy. All that may de
ceive some folk down South, but in the North, where
freedom of opinion is a birthright, it will deceive no
body. \ v

Reiterating that Tacoma is the home city, the Ledger
asserts that Tacoma had. at the last census, the small
est population of male residents of full age to the total
population, and the largest ratio of married women and
children of any northwestern community. In fact, the
males twenty-one years and more old in Tacoma were
but 37.1 per cent of the total population, leaving nearly
two-thirds to be classed as legal infants. At Portland
the males 21 years and more old were 42.2 per cent, at
Seattle 48.9, at Spokane 40.6 per cent.
If Tacoma can make good its statement that it is now
the "home city" among its compeers, it will appear from
the statistics of relative juvenility that it has good rea
son to expect a continuation of its ascendency in this
particular, for young people are naturally the most
numerous home builders.
cudgels to prove that the "homeland" is theirs and not
Tacoma's.
That there may be no misunderstanding relative to the
exact significance of Tacoma's averment, a few statis
tics are supplied from the columns of the Ledger. In
the returns of the last United v States census, as the
figures are construed from the Tacoma aspect, 84.8 per
cent of, Tacoma's total population was found to be in
private families; Spokane was second in this respect,
having in families 80.7 per cent, while Portland had 75.1
per cent and Seattle but 67.9 per cent. The average size
of the families in Tacoma, Portland and Seattle was 4.2
persons. Spokane, so the figures would seem to prove,
had but 3.9 persons to a family on the average. By the
same census, according to the same analyst of statis
tics, the school attendance at Tacoma amounted to 18
per cent of the total population, at Seattle to 12.6 per
cent, at Spokane 16.6 per. cent, and at Portland 14.7 per
cent. S
Since the United States census figures were made up
Tacoma has had a new source of information about its
own population, the facts being supplied by a just-issued
city directory/This contains the names of 26,962 in
dividuals, excluding all names of firms, corporations,
streets, buildings and the like, which appear in the list.
Married women and children are not named in the direc
tory. The multiple applied at'Tacoma to find from the
directory the actual population is 2j^. This makes trie
present population of Tacoma 67,405. The same multi

The peculiar predicament of a man
who, unconscious at the time, did not
know the surgeon that operated upon
him, and has since been sued for fees
by a doctor who did not operate, is set
forth in an interesting affidavit filed
yesterday in support of a motion for a
new trial. The document is also an ad
mission of an attorney's oversight in
the prosecution of his client's case.
Percy E. Fuller, holding an assigned
claim for $750 from Dr. J. A. Sllverman
against David Bernstein, sued the lat
ter for the amount and the case came
to trial, on December 10, 1903, but was
continued until April of this year, when
Fuller got Judgment.
The affidavit on appeal is made by
Leon Samuels, attorney for Bernstein.
In the first place, Samuels says, he did
not believe the case would be tried on
the date set and he did not prepare for
it. His reason for bo believing was
that Silverman was in Alaska and a
deposition obtained from him was sign
ed by a notary, A. M. Randol, to whom
the court had issued no commission.
For that reason he never examined the
deposition and his objection to Its use
In evidence was sustained at the first
hearing. But in April the Silverman
deposition was admitted in evidence,
and it said ' among other things that
Bernstein had promised to pay the doc
tor well for the operation. Samuels de
clares he is in possession of a letter
in which Silverman says that he' only
assigned a claim for $500. In the way
of other new evidence Samuels adda
that when Bernstein was operated upon
he waa unconscious and none of his
relatives was present. It was not
learned until later that the operation

Health Board Receives Report From
Chief In5pectlng Physician Hassler
Regarding Illegal Practice,
In performing: the autopsy in the
case of Daniel Manning, Dr. â¢ Baci
galupi found that the three wounds
were probably self-inflicted. -The
clothing near the wound in the breast
was badly burned, showing that the
pistol was held only a few inches from
the body. One of the bullets was fired
into the man's face, almost tearing
away his Jaw. All the wounds were
powder marked.
Neatly folded with a letter from his
daughter, Mrs. Effie Munroe of Sioux
City, Iowa, was a note, as follows:
"City Coronerâ Dear Sir: Do not
blame any one. I am tired of life."
Manning was about 65 years of age
and had been a heavy drinker and on
that account was for the third time dis
charged from his employment at the
Morrow building Saturday night. Since
his dismissal he told Christensen that
he intended to shoot his late employer
and seemed determined to carry out
his threat.
In the meantime Policeman Winzler
entered the room and found Manning
dead. Detectives Wren and Dinan and
Deputy Coroner Brown made an in
vestigation and concluded that it was
a case of self-destruction. Two shots
entered the man's head and one was
fired into his breast.
Alarmed, Christensen was about to
hurry frdm the room when Manning
ordered him to remain. The frightened
man, however, made good his escape.
As he leftV he heard two more shots
flred. He hastened to the Harbor
Emergency, Hospital and notified the
officials of the occurrence.
Chris Christensen, who occupied the
same bed with deceased, waa awaken
ed by the report of a pistol. Looking
up he saw blood streaming from Man
ning, who was sitting on the side of
the bed. fully dressed.
Peter Manning, an elevator man, un
til recently employed at the Morrow
building, 15 Sutter street, shot and
killed himself in a squalid apartment
in the basement at 538 Howard street
at about 11 o'clock yesterday morning.
At first there was some suspicion that
Manning had been murdered, but in
quiry Boon set aside all idea of foul
play.

he said, he mentally noted every re
port until the fifth shot Indicated that
the weapon was empty. The first bul
let struck the back of his head and
prostrated him, and he lay there count
ing, while other leaden missiles were
fired Into his body. After the fifth re
port he struggled to his feet.
The cross-examination will be re-
Eumed to-morrow morning, and Attor
ney Murphy says he will then intro
duce some documentary evidence in the
shape of letters that passed between
Goldman and Snow.
Glen J. Ross, the juvenile blackmailer
who operated in Jefferson Square, got

Police Sergeant Dunn's squad went
valiantly to protect the bench warmers
in Columbia Square from the hoodlum
ism to which they were subjected by
a gang of small boys, and the result of
the first, round-up was five prisoners
of ages ranging from ten to fifteen. It
was the wont of the quintet and others
like. them, the policemen said, to dis
turbs the wooing of youthful couples
by stealing up behind the'benches upon
which they were seated and violently
pushing them over. In that way the
defendants had abruptly transformed
moments of bliss into moments of
fright for their victims. One pair were
upset with violence and severaly in
jured.
The defendants unanimously declared
that they were guiltless of the offense
alleged, but confessed they knew of
such offenses having been committed
by "other kids." Cases continued till
Saturday by Judge Mogan, and police
instructed to bring "other kids" to
court. /
With an iron bar S. C. Lewis, a stal
wart soldier, cracked the heads of
Faust Musant and another complain
ant, with whom he entered into com
bat in a Pacific-street saloon, and so
seriously was Faust injured that Judge
Fritz continued the case against his
assailant till next Saturday.
Anyone Horezy of 84S Howard street
ordered mush and medium boiled eggs
in a Fourth-street restaurant, and
when the waiter, Dan Vascalles,
brought him fried eggs he refused to
take them. Then he complained of
the quality and quantity of the but
ter served to him, whereupon the
waiter blackened his eye. Judge Con
larf will hear further details to-day.
The women are neighbors in the 600
block of Greenwich street and the bat
tery was committed on June 15. Since
then the case has been called several
times and continued on account of the
reported illness of Mrs. de Grazia.
She was a nervous wreck and unable
to leave her couch, an eloquent young
lawyer paid, so severely had her feel
ings been injured by Mrs. Patton prior
to the felling of that woman by the
clothesline prop. How long Mrs. de
Grazia's excuse would have kept the
court in suspense no man could sur
mise, but the news came that she had
been seen on the street. Then it de
veloped that a bargain sale was the
undoing of her seclusion. She was
unable to resist the alluring announce
ments of a summer stock clean-out by
one of the big dry goods establish
ments and was caugrht mingling with
the crowd of femininity that packed
the store and blocked the sidewalk.
When the Judge heard of her ability
to hold her own in the bargain sale
melee he pronounced her fit to with
stand the comparatively tame ordeal
of a Police Court trial. A bench war
rant accordingly issued.
Mrs. Patton averred that she had
never by word or deed provoked the
enmity of Mrs. de Grazia, It was true,
however, that the little Miss de Grazia
had written on a fence with chalk cer
tain libelous attacks on little Miss Pat
ton and that she (Mrs. Patton) had
informed Mrs. de Grazia that the slan
ders must be stopped. This warning
was given in quiet tone and printable
language as the women stood in their
respective back yards, separated by a
fence. The next thing Mrs. Patton
knew was a severe pain in her head,
caused by the clothesline prop.
Mrs. de Grazia's story, as filtered
through an interpreter, was a complete
denial of everything Mrs. Patton had
testified. v
A clothesline prop, qualified by
length and sturdiness to serve with
distinction as the mainmast of a forty
foot yacht, was the implement utilized
by Mrs. Julia de Grazia to convey phy
sical injury to Mrs. Mary Ann Patton.
Mrs. de Grnzia will be sentenced by
Police Judge Mogan to-day for bat

Edward Woods and Harry Scott, tel
ephone linemen, and Edward Burke, a
Southern Pacific brakeman, were ac
cused of holding up Florian Andralne,
vocation not registered, and robbing
him of. $150 early yesterday morning on
Stevenson street, between Third and
Fourth. Florian, who lives at 951 Six
teenth avenue south, did not appear to
prosecute, and Judge MoganA continued
the case until this morning.
Patrolman W. J. Sheehan repeated
the story told to him by Florian. The
defendants, he said, were eating break
fast in a Fourth street restaurant
when Florian entered and In a burst
of good-fellowship, although he had
never seen either of them before, in
sisted on paying for their food. They
magnanimously allowed him to do so,
and he left them there and proceeded
on his way. Then they followed him
and took his money.
Dottie Kelly and Maggie Smith, who
had been arrested for vagrancy and
released on $10 bail, were attired in
snowy opera cloaks and â¢ towering
masses of white millinery when they
entered Judge Conlan's court yester
day morning, and so disorderly was
their demeanor as they gat awaiting,
trial that they were ordered into cus
tody for contempt.
"Mercy!" exclaimed vNIiss Kelly, in
incredulous tone, "you don't mean to
say you expect us to wear these
clothes in them filthy cells?"
"The matter of prison wardrobe I
leave entirely to you," was the Judge's
response. "It's not the clothes, but
their wearers, that have outraged the
dignity of this court."
After a prolonged and audible intake
of breath Miss Smith indignantly in
quired, "Did any one ever?" No one
had.
Charley Murray, alias, Moore, an es
caped convict charged with grand lar

by order of Judge Fritz. At the time

An echo of the glorious Fourth re
scunded in Judge Mogan's court when
E. J. "Walsh was called and charged
with peace disturbance. The complain
ant was Policeman Suttman. who testi
fied that on the last anniversary of the
nation's birth he was conversing with a
lady at Twenty-fourth and Castro
streets when the defendant covertly
placed a large bomb, with lighted fuse,
between the complainant's feet, and
that the resultant explosion not only
frightened the lady almost to death,
but scorched and tore his clothes.
Walsh declared that some other fel
low, unknown to him, committed the
incendiary act, and his Honor gave
him till next Saturday to prove his
defense.

George Curry, the gripman who shot
and killed his wife in a Turk-street
lodging-house on July 6, was a picture
of absolute dejection when he ap
peared before Judge Mogan for pre
liminary examination. The testimony
wos a repetition of that given at the
inquest and will be resumed at noon
to-day.
Annie, Brown, a middle-aged siren
of the Barbary Coast, was held by
Judge Fritz to answer a gTand larceny
charge in the Superior Court The
complaining witness was a gray
haired farmer. N. N. Robinson, from

woman of having robbed him of a
purse containing $20<h while he was in

Six months in the County Jail was

Proctor for cruelly neglecting her
three young children. Her husband,
who is a stableman, was ordered into
custody and will be tried to-day for

visiting nurse for the Associated
Charities, testified that within three
weeks she had gone to. the Proctor
home on Shipley street thirty-one
times, and on each occasion found the
woman drunk and the children hun
gry, ragged and fllthy. Photographs
of the little ones were exhibited to

TEN ROUNDS AND A VICTORY
FOR McGRAW'S NEW YORKERS
NEW YORK. July 12.â Highball, the
American Derby winner and one of the
best of the three-year-olds, broke his
leg at the ankle during the running of
the Seagate stakes at Brighton Beach
to-day. As Highball is insured for
$25,000, a message was sent to a rep
resentative of the Insurance company
In New York to come at once to look
at the Derby winner and end his agony,
and Bud May, half owner of the horse.
finally consented to have him shot.
Only three faced the starter for the
Seagate stakes, with Highball favorite
at 11 to 20. Highball showed in front
to the first turn, when he bore out, and
Odom had to hit him over the head to
keep him in. Knight Errant then as
eumed the lead and showed the way to
the finish, winning, easily by two
lengths from St. Valentine.
As the field swung into the stretch
Highball was seen to falter and Odom
et once pulled him up and dismounted.
After several attempts to walk him off
the track a man held the broken leg
while a half dozen others pushed him
to the Infield, where his leg was
strapped up so it could not touch the
ground. He was then led to his sta-
Lle.
The famous horse, winner of many
good races last year and of the $26,
000 American Derby, at Washington
Park, Chicago, on June 18 last, was de
stroyed, his owners having taken pro
fessional advice from two veterinari
ans, who declared that the double frac
ture of the pastern was so bad that it
was useless to attempt to save him.
Highball was Insured by Lloyds of
London.

Past Grand Master William H. Barnes,
Grand Treasurer J. W. Harris and
Grand Secretary George T. Shaw, be
eldes several specially Invited guests.
The tables, three in number, were
most tastefully decorated with flowers,
the main feature of the decoration,
however, being hundreds of sweet
smelling magnolias, symbolic of the
name of the lodge. The menu card, a
pretty souvenir, was made more in
terestiiifr by appropriate Quotations
from the poets, following the an
nouncement of each course.
Edward R. Moss was the toastmaster
Â¦nd after the excellent supper he
called upon the following to respond
to toasts, after announcing that Grand
Master J. W. Llnscott of Santa Cruz
was unable to be present by reason of
illness: Past Grand Master Barnes,
Grand Secretary Shaw, Grand Treas
urer Harris; J. K. Phillips, the only
living member of the lodge of fifty
years ago; Harry K. Wolff, noble
grand of Bay City Lodge; Past Grand
Frank D. Worth and E. C. Stock.
From the talks It appeared that the

fly gave Portland the game this after
noon and practically killed what little
chance Seattle had of winning the lead
for the first half of the season.
Seattle made a desperate rally In the
eighth, but closed one run short of ty

a magnificent game for the home team,
striking out eight men. In the last
two innings he fanned fiver Butler
used nothing but a slow ball, yet the
Siwashes could not hit if safe. Dren

San Francisco and Oakland will fur
nish the attraction this afternoon. The
game will be called at 3:30, the usual
Recreation Park will be thrown open
once more this afternoon and the fans
who have been longing for the time to
come when they might see baseball on
the home green will feel glad that the
month of agony Is up. It seems a long
time since that old familiar cry of
"Play ball" has resounded in the neigh
borhood of Eighth street and it will
undoubtedly sound sweeter than ever
when Umpire Tom Browne sings It out
for the first time In his life to a San
Francisco crowd. *
But the homecoming of the San Fran
cisco team will not carry a bit of Joy
with it. All the honest, hardworking
fans vow they will not be on hand
to Bee such a bunch of tramps perform.
The record of the locals In the north
has been worse than disgraceful. The
team was bad enough when at home,
but managed to win once in a while.
Since leaving here it has acted almost
criminally.
Uncle's bunch comes home Just two
games shy of being in the cellar. It is
only a question of a few days when it
will land there and there it will stay
as sure as fate. It's curtains with
San Francisco and every local fan
knows that much. For a time many
thought we might be saved from the
disgrace of being tail-enders, but there
is no chance now.
Oakland did not do so awful well in
the north, but at that, it played a lit
tle baseball occasionally. Peter Loh
man has no chance to be a headliner
when the first half of the season closes
July 25. but still he may make a bid
to oust Los Angeles from third posi
tion. Lohman has suffered a lot of
hard luck and if Dunleavy gets Into
the game this week there may be some
fun.
Mike Fisher is to be congratulated
on his success. His team is a wonder
and every one knows it now. The Ti
gers have proved the sensation of the
season. They have played the kind bf
baseball that wins pennants and the
kind that the public likes to see. Every
fan is willing now to doff his hat to
Fisher and Charley Graham as well as
to big Overall Eagan, Doyle, Casey,
Sheehan and the rest of the layout.
Seattle struck its winning gait too
late. The league sluggers slumped
when they should have been playing
the game and now they are paying for
their foolishness. Portland has proved
a surprise. The Brownies never quit
even when they seemed to be down and
out and now their gameness is begin
ning to assert Itself. Â¦
Los Angeles is Just about where it
belongs. The southerners never could
strike their batting gait and you can't
win ball games without numerous base
hits. The Angels were lucky to be in
third place. Their fleetness of foot while
on the bag3 was the only thing that
saved them.
Wonderful Racer Meets
With the Fatal Accident
While Coming in Stretch
On Thursday Hanlon will commence
his regular gymnasium stunts. He will
punch the bag for fifteen minutes,
skip the rope for the same length of
time and wrestle and box with his
training mates. Eddie has had a new
punching bag installed in his gym
nasium. % It is of the pattern that is
fastened at the top and bottom with
elastic jiords and' is much faster and
harder "to Judge on the rebound than
the bag that is hung by a single cord.
Hanlon expects the new bag will maka
him quicker and more accurate in de
livering: blows.
Battling Nelson put In another stren
uous day at his training quarters at
Larkspur yesterday. This morning he
took/ a run around San Quentln Point,
a distance of about ten miles, accom
panied by Ted Murphy and Dava
Barry.
"Smiling" Metzner started with the
boys, but did not put in an appear
ance until many hours later. It was
one too many for him. The greater
part of the afternoon was devoted to
boxing and shadow fighting. Nelson
boxed four rounds each with Frank
Newhouse and Frank Rafael, ,who Join
ed the camp to-day.
The weather was very warm yes
terday and Nelson perspired freely. He
is taking off weight rapidly and seems
to be In the pink of condition. If the
weather continues warm to-day he will
ease up work and take a swim at
Escalle baths.
Road running, baseball playing and
swimming constituted Eddie Hanlon's
first day's training in Alameda yester
day. In the morning the little boxer
went out for a long spin on the high
ways with Toby Irwin and Fred Land
ers, traveling as far east as Fruit
vale. In the afternoon Eddie partici
pated in .a game of ball on the big
field in the rear of Croll's Hotel. He is
almost as expert In swinging the
bat and handling the sphere as he Is
in wielding the fists that have won him
fame In the roped arena. Alter the

CHICAGO, July 12.â Bragg and Hel
gesen formed a killing combination in
the fourth race at Harlem * to-day.
Backed from 9 to 2 to 5 to 2, Curl's
"rogue," under severe punishment, got
up Just in time to win by a head in the
final stride from Action. The struggle
between these two lasted the full
length of the stretch and Action had
the advantage to within three jumps
of the wire, where Helgesen's superior
finish asserted itself.
Bondage, always favorite at 9 to 5
backed from 2 to 1, was slow to begin.
He could not make up the lost ground
and finished tired, four lengths back.
Ahola, an outsider at 17 to 1, and
Warte Nicht set an early pace to the
far turn, where Action took command
and led by a length and a half into the
stretch. Bragg had moved up from
fourth to second place at this point,
and then the real struggle began.
It was one of the hardest and gamest
finishes of the meeting and showed
conclusively what a good boy can do'
when the pinch comes. Beau Ormonde
drifted up in the betting from 4 to 8
to 1 on account of the slow condition
of the track, as he doesn't like' anything
but a fast track. The weather was
pleasant, and track in fair condition.
Two favorites, two second choices and
two outsiders captured the money.
Jockey Helgesen was fined $50 for fail
ing to ride out Moorish Damsel in the
fifth race.
Patrol Judge Hughey Keough was
thrown from his buggy at the head of
the stretch during the running of the
second race. He fell beneath his
horse's feet and received a fractured
jaw. Summary: '

NEW YORK, July 12.â From start
to finish the handicap at^ nine fur

much criticism. There was no pace
whatsoever. The Cricket beat â¢ the
barrier with "WildAThyme oft very
badly. She caught the others on back
stretch and with "Jack" Martin sitting
straight up in her saddle everybody
shouted, "Wait until they reach the
stretch. Wild Thyme will walk in."
But she didn't walk in, at least not
in front. The Cricket was never headed.

NEWS OF THE OCEAN.
The Levee Break Unfilled.
The tug Resolute, which has been at Bouldln
Island on the Sacramento Ulver for several
months, returned yesterday. She has been
engaged towing barges of rock from Point San
Pablo 'to the island, where the work of filling
in the levee-br^ak has been going on. Over
ilSu.OuO has been spent and there is still a
breach over 200 feet wide and .thirty- six feet
of water to fill up. Tho San Pablo quarry U
exhausted and the work is checked for veveral
months. ,
ders tended to scare Cervera out of
Santiago, but the noise they made kept
the men of the other Vessels awake
during their watches below and broke
all the wineglasses in the officers'
wardrooms fifteen miles away.
After peace was declared 1 the Navy
Department turned the guns of two
wars Into the scrap heap and the Cid-
Nictheroy-Buffalo into a peaceful
training ship where the young recruit
learns to i_f>h his hammock and scrub
paint-work. But she is fast. She started
up from Brazil to Cuba with the Oregon,
her gun charged to use on the Span
iarda ( that menaced the peerless Cali
fornia battleship, and easily kept pace
with the big white battleship until
her machinery broke down. As she
is never loaded down to a freight-boat
depth she sits high out of the water
and in a sea rolls deeply. She is of
quick movement' even in her wallow
ings and will make a complete swing
from starboard to port and return in
eight seconds.
The Buffalo is of 6680 tons burden,
and 408 feet long and forty-five feet
beam. Her draft is about twenty-two
feet of water aft and seventeen feet
forward.^ Her long,- roomy decks ,are
promenades for her officers and crew,
especially the spardeck with its beauti
ful white narrow planking.- There are
ample accommodations aboard this fine
vessel for 500 men and 600 may crowd
into her. Like those of the merchant
vessels, the officers' quarters are on the
spardeck. .Where the dynamite gain
stood, there are now two five-inch rifles
âbeauties they are, too, and their ef
fect in action would be more than 1
moral. She also has four four-inch
rifles On the gundeck and a secondary
battery of six and one pounders.
COALING UP THE DUCKLINGS.
Going out to Manila she had an en
joyable time convoying the five de
stroyers. She swept along at about ten
knots* with her brood trailing in her
wake. A destroyer is aT coal-eater and
every little while one of these ducklings
would signal for fnore fuel. If it was
rough weather the mother-ship would
stop and the whole fleet-would roll over
the seas till the water became smooth
er Then the destroyers with empty
bunkers- would come alongside and
coal. The Buffalo carried fuel for. all
her small convoy fleet. Each destroyer
consumed about fifty tons a day and
as their bunker spaces are only corners
not filled with machinery the distress
signals for coal flew often from their
flag staffs.
The Buffalo, may, remain on this coast
several months, but she must finally
return to the Atlantic, where newjboil
ers are being built for her. Captain
Everett. was in command of the little
lighthouse tender Mangrove when she
caught the big Spanish liner and auxil
iary cruiser Panama Just outside of
Havana on April 28, '.-1S98. The Span
iard carried a crew of seventy-two
men, "twenty-nine passengers,; a cargo
of corn and other .provisions for "the
beleaguered city. Captain Everett took
him prize by, a rare combination of
skill, intrepidity and pure bluff.
In Trouble for Forgery.
Geronimo Rodriguez and Alfredo
Perez are in trouble with the United
States authorities over the forged dis
charge of a sailor. Rodriguez is un
der arrest and the United States Mar
shal is searching for Perez. It ap
pears that Perez was regularly dis
charged Irom the steamship Sierra
and received a certificate to that ef
fect. His friend Rodriguez, being
sick and not having a certificate which
â¢would entitle -him to treatment in the
United States Marine Hospital, In
duced Perez to give him his certificate
and forged Perez's name to it. The
forged name was written by Rodriguez
in the presence Â« f an oflicer of the
hospital.
Almost Wrecked at Sea.
A dispatch from London, dated July 12.
says that the Norwegian bark Rokeby. from
Whatcom to that port, via Saa Franctaco. haa
arrived at Delagoa Bay in a wrecked con
dition. She lost her boats, the bulwarks wera
damaged by boarding seas and she lost a
large portion of her cargo.

The United States naval transport'
Buffalo, famous for her record of serv
ice, in other navies, arrived late Mon
day night from Magdalena Bay. She
left New York for the Philippines,
steaming through the Suez canal and
calling at Bombay and Singapore. She
returned to Singapore, where she was
ordered to Guam, Honolulu, Panama.
Magrdalena and San Francisco.
The Buffalo is a naval training ship
for landsmen and carries an unusual
number of warrant officers. Her com
mander is Captain W. H. Everett, U.
S. X., and her officers are as follows:
Lieutenant Commander T. D. Griffin,
executive officer; Lieutenant Command
er V. S. Nelson, navigator; lieutenants,
J. P. McGinnis, A. H. Robertson, Louis
Shane. W. R. Sayles; ensign, O. W.
Fowler; surgeons, L. W. Curtis and
D. B. Kerr; chaplain, J. F. Flemming,
and Assistant Paymaster G. T. South
gate. Added to her complement are
three engineers and eleven warrant of
ficers.
The Buffalo carried a number of men
for the naval station at Manila, but
her principal mission to the Orient was
to accompany five torpedo-boat de
stroyers to the Asiatic fleet. She started
homeward from Manila, but was turned
back at Singapore. After a call at
Honolulu and. Panama her orders read
to proceed to Magdalena Bay and bring
the body of the late Captain W. W.
Reisneger. who died in that port two
years ago while in command of the
cruiser Philadelphia. The remains are
now on board the Buffalo and will be
sent to Arlington, near Washington,
D. C. for burial.
The transport has a history all her
own. She was purchased by Brazil
while she was the Eteamship El Cid of
the Morgan line. Then she was turned
loose at the rebels of the revolution of
1Â£98 as the dynamite cruder Nictheroy.
The Brazilian never. fired her one gun â
probably they were afraid it would
shake Rio Janeiro downâ but its moral
effect smashed the insurrection. When
the rebels saw the muzzle of that aw
ful gun pointed at them they dropped
their arms and "took to the tall tim
ber."
Then the moral cruiser Nictheroy
lay gathering seaweed and barnacles
in the harbor till the Maine settled un
der Havana bay. Then the United
States Navy | Department rubbed the
rust off the gun, polished up the ship's
bright- work, called her the Quffalu
and sent her down to try her famous
moral effect on' the Spaniards, who
were using smokeless powder on Ameri
can soldiers In Cuba. She was joined
by the Vesuvius and the two vessels
shook up the old pirate wrecks lying
in the 8panish main.

NEW YORK, July 12.â Among a num
ber of strange tales related by tha
crew of the steamship Shlmo8a, Just
arrived from Japan and China, and
which reported having: run over a large
whale a few mile* outside Sandy Hook,
is'one to the effect that while the big
freighter was speeding through the
Red Sea a Lascar sailor was picked tip.
The swarthy heathen declared he had
been swimming three days and nights,
having fallen overboard from an In
dian trader bound for Antwerp. Cap-^
tain Champlin is certain that the man
was at least thirty-six hours In the
water before the Shimosa picked him
up. i
"It was about 5 o'clock on June 13."
he said. "We were steaming through
the Red Sea and were three or four
days from Suez when the lookout sight
ed something in the water on the port
bow. The ship waa stopped and a few
minutes later the chap came swim
ming alongside. We got the sea ladder
over and he climbed on board without
help.
"We gave him a wash down with
fresh water and a peg of rum to liven
him up and then, after giving him
something to eat, sent him to bed. He
seemed all right when he woke up the
next morning, but we coold get little
out of him except the name of the ves
sel'from which he had fallen over
board and his statement that he had
been three days and nights swimming.
"On reaching Suez we found that the
Imaun, to which the Lascar belonged,
had touched there Just thirty-six hours
before we arrivod. From this I Judge
that the man had been that length of
time in the water. I sent him to the
British Consul."
Some but not all of the awards of

REAL- ESTATE TRANSACTIONS.
The Ions contest over the estate of
Charles "Watson was ended yesterday
when Judge TToutt ordered a final de
cree of distribution in favor of the
daughters, Mattie, Elizabeth, Esther,
Eva and Emma, in equal shares. The
estate In California was worth about
$20,000. Watson left al>out $30,000 in
the East. The will was contested by
Charles Arnold and Ellen Davis, who
declared themselves to he son and
daughter of the deceased. They . al
leged that Watson's true name was
Charles Arnold and that in 1849 in Lon
don he married Emily Nightingale.
They said he came to California and
assumed the name of Watson. The
daughters opposed the contest and gave
proof of-' his marriage to Jane Ann
Kerr in 1861. The property of the Cal
vary Presbyterian Church, at Fillmore
street and Pacific avenue, bequeathed
by Watson, was also involved in the
contest.
Watson Estate Settled.

The Drison keeper did so and In a
few minutes Alexander was behind
the bars with the bolts shot back into
plage.
"Well," said the prison-keeper,
"we'll handcuff you and see what you'll
do then." The cuffs were Dlaced on
his wrists and the cell doors again
locked. â¢ In a few minutes the man
was once more at liberty with the
cuffs unlocked and the cell door
standing open. Alexander refused to
explain the trick. "I did six months
for this once before." he said.
- From that time until the prisoner
was removed to the Hall of Justice
a close watch was kept on him lest
he escape.
Claude Alexander, who assaulted
W.-H. "Nicholson at the Chutes on
Monday nisrht, outwitted the prison
keepers at the park police station,
where he was taken after committing
the offense. When Alexander was
charged and placed in the 'cell he
groodnaturedly told the prison keepers
that it would be useless to lock him
up as he cojuld set out at his pleas
ure. His defiance was laughed at,
but he requested his keeper to turn
his back toward the cell and see
whether he was telling the truth. It
required but a few minutes for the
prisoner to stand in front of the of
cer a free man. When asked how he
did the trick he replied. "Just turn
your back and I'll get inside the
bars." /

NEW YORK, July 12.â The wavering and
uncertain fluctuations in to-day's stock market
gave place to some positive . evidences . of
strength late In the day. with considerable in
crease in .animation of the dealings. | As a
reflection of sentiment" over the outlook for the
bUkiiK** lndufctry the movement may be' con
strued as an expression of hopefulness,* still
tempered by uncertainties. The * immediate
rnoverrcr.t wa* mostly professional and was
laristly induced by "characteristic trade mo
tives, bat the underlying conditions in the
nv.rktt which mad* such professional opera
tions successful must be considered,- and glvÂ«
the true value to the action of the securities
market aÂ« an Index to conditions of- a com
prehensive ecope. The motives which actuated
thÂ« trading were plainly made up in large
part of supposition^ as to the source of the
transactions in the market and suspicions
au to the market operations which might be
going on under cover of the more open orders
given. 5 The easing off Of prices after the
opening, in face of the encouraging color. of
the 'jovcrnment's monthly crop report, was a
source of much disappointment and was taken
to indicate ctearly that the speculative party
which took proflits on so large a scale yester
day were *tili eager to realize on their hold

Trade in miscellaneous vegetables was nor

Poultry and Game.
I
No more We#tern poultry was put on sale I
and the receipts from domestic sources wer* Â¦
moderate, but trade waa quiet and the market '
still had a weak tone. Fryejs were quoted [
lower and Broilers were Inclined to easiness, Â¦
with some dealers offering concessions In order I
to clean up. A car of Western falls due to- '

Butter, Cheese and Eggs. ;
Conditions in Batter remain unchanged. Re- |
celpts are liberal, stocks are heavy, Eastern i
cubes are cutting into the trade in the State
product and almost every house is making
concessions to gat rid of its surplus. The feel- '
ins is naturally weak under these conditions. ;
Cheese Is not as firm as Just before the re- i
cent advance. Dealers report that posted buy- j
era want the best In the market at not to ex- I
ceed 9c. and If they cannot get It leave the ';
store Â»nd do not come back. The inference, i
therefore, is that they get it somewhere at this '
figure. The supply is large- and the market Is '
lew active. â¢ ' \
Eggs are firm and are again apparently mov
ing upward, the majority of houses quoting
27c for the best ranch, which are in light j
supply. The medium and lower grades are also I
steadying in sympathy with ranch.

Deciduous and Citrus Fruits.
The fruit market was still badly congested '
with common offerings of Peaches, chiefly of
the Hale's Early variety, which moved very
slowly at 2."<s:>.->i; per small box. The abun
dance of poor fruit had a depressing effect on
the sale of superior quality offerings and the
St. John variety of yellow, which were in com
paratively light supply, were weak, with 50c
per box an extreme figure. Receipts of baskets
from the river were light and some exception
ally fine lots of yellow commanded a small
premium on the wharf. Plums, Prunes and
common Pears were abundant with prices Ir
regular, while flne offerings of Apples and good
Bartlett Pears were steady under a good de
mand, both < for local use and /shipping ac
count. Apricots and Figs did better under
decreased receipts and the first erop of tha
latter is about exhausted In some sections.
Cherries were Â¦ offering at 50c@|l per drawer
and 5@6c per pound in bulk, but sold very
slowly. The White Nectarines that came in
on the preceding day were still held at 50i@65c
I per box or crate, but were slow sellers, as
i the fruit was I too hard and green to invite
; trade. Cantaloupes from Bakersfleld were more
; plentiful and lower, while other Melons were
Â¦ unchanged. The demand for Long worth Straw
! berries showed some improvement and price*
ranged higher, but the other Berries continued
to drag.

CHICAGO, July 12.â Hopeful speculators
were misled at the outset by a more promising
outlook In the Weather conditions in the Mis
souri Valley and offered wheat for Kale, al
though they . believed the worst was over. :
â¢Opining sales for September were at 84 %c tÂ» |
bi'Hc a decline of i/i/ lio to %@ 1 ,i t c, and' for:
a time there was sharp rivalry among traders !
to rid themselves of their long holdings. Tha j
Government crop estimate, showing a liberal
increase in production, helped to produce the '
Short lived bearish tone. Before the rise was
fairly digested, however, other crop reports
from the Northwest, together with predictions
Of rain in the Southwest, created A Â«cleslre to
buy which became contagious. September sold
up to M%e and 0 caused earlier sellers to regain
.the lines disposed ot. on the decjine and. Uie .

wheat prices. The close, however, was steady
at 4H^Â©48%c for September.
Trade In oats was dull, fluctuations being
within a narrow 'range. September closed at
the opening figure, 31%e32c.
The strike at the stock yards created an .un

there was a Jclr demand. Prices held

BARLEY â The feeling is firmer all around.
Futures are higher, the cash grain is strong
under light offerings, the brewers are now ac
tive buyers of new brewing, several shippers
are- look in* for supplies in the country, and
one at least is trying to make up a cargo for
England at $1 Port Costa, but with indifferent
success, as the holders are asking $1 05. In
addition, the millers are looking about the
country for supplies so the situation seems
to be assuming considerable strength. There is
a good deal of talk to the effect that both the
Wheat and -Barley crops will probably turn
out lighter than expected, owing to the larger
quantity of . pinched and i otherwise Inferior
grain -this year, and this impels buyers to en
ter the Held for supplies in order to forestall
a possible advance" in prices later on.

from Illinois three months ago, and
went to work as a hostler for Pierce
on the day of the strike, testified that
tw,enty-flve men or more marched in
the circle daily for at least ten days,
and in the calling out of the leaders
he heard the phrase "scab stable" used.
The large crowds came between 5 and
7 o'clock in the evenings. On account
of the gatherings drivers of rigs en
tering the stables would have to halt
until the pickets opened the lines. T.
A. Pearson, who had frequented the
stable since his arrival here on April
23, told a like story of the con
duct of. the union representatives. He
had seen as many as fifty men march
ing In the circle, and eight banners
carried in the line.
H. Mortensen, connected with the
firm of Varney & Green, said that his
firm ,kept" twenty horses at the stable
and he had been waited upon by two
representatives of the union who asked
him to remove the animals. They de
manded an Immediate answer, but he
did not give it. They returned a few
weeks later and he told them that Mr.
Varney was in the East and he could
give them no reply. They did not call
again.

The case was a flagrant one. Aiken
was placed under arrest by the com
manding officer of the Twenty-eighth
Regiment, Colonel William L. Pitcher,
for disobedience of orders and while
under arrest deliberately left the post
and absented himself for two days.
He was found in a maudlin condition
outside of the post by some of the men
of his company and taken back to the
cantonment. He was tried by a court of
his superiors, all officers of high stand
ing in the army. Following was the
personnel of the court: Colonel Alfred
C. Markley, Thirteenth Infantry; Lieu
tenant Colonel Luigi Lomia, Artillery
Corps; Major William Stephenson,
medical department; Major Alexis R.
Paxton, Thirteenth Infantry; Captain
Samson L. Faison, Thirteenth Infan
try; . Captain Charles^ H. Hunter, Ar
tillery Corps; Captain Arthur Johnson,
Thirteenth Infantry; Captain Ira A.
Haynes, Artillery Corps; Captain Mar
cus B. Stokes, Tenth Infantry; Captain
John B. Christian, Ninth Cavalry, and
Captain James V. Heidt, Tenth In
fantry. Captain John J. Bradley, Four
teenth Infantry, was judge advocate.
While these officers brought in a ver
dict of guilty of the charges preferred,
Aiken is allowed to go practically un
punished.
This was not the first offense com
mitted by Aiken. Twice before he had
been tried by a court-martial, but each
time managed to slip through with only
a reprimand.
.Lieutenant Aiken left last night for
Knoxvllle, Tenn., on a two months'
leave of absence. During this period
he will gradually disappear from the
ranks of army life.
The officers and men of the Twenty
eighth Infantry are pleased with the
orders sending them to the department
of Dakota, for which statipn they will
leave early in October. While they en
joy life at the Presidio and the advan
tages of San Francisco, they have
never been satisfied with their quar
ters at the cantonment there. The
barracks at Fort Snelling, ' near St.
Paul, are among the best In the coun
try. The entire regiment will, go there,
excepting two* companies, which will go
to Fort Lincoln, North Dakota. The
place of the' Twenty-eighth will be
temporarily filled here by the Twenty
first Iiif antry. This regiment will in
all probability only remain at the Pre
sidio for a Bhort time, as it la sched
uled to go to Samar. There they will
relieve the Fourteenth. Infantry,- which
will come back. to the_ post here.

briskly on, preparatory to receiving- the

The findings in the court-martial of
First Lieutenant William B. Aiken
seem to have had very little weight
with the War Department at Wash
ington. Lieutenant Aiken was tried
at the Presidio on a charge of breach
of arrest and was found guiltyl Ac
cording to the law of the country there
is only one penalty for this offense,
and that is dismissal from the army.
This regulation seems to have been
overlooked, as Aiken has been permit
ted by the authorities at Washington
to hand in his resignation, which is
to be accepted, and he is to be retired
with an honorable discharge, whereas
if the verdict of the court .was carried
out he would be dishonorably dis
missed.

The ctirs were rumpling a cage full
of tender squabs as the policeman
burried to a phone and rang up Frank
Bianchi at 1900 Twentieth street.
"Three dogs are eating a chicken
â¢Winner on you." said O'Brien.
Bianchi could not understand at
first- "O-h-i-c-k-e-n," sang the po-
Jiceman to make himself clear.
'That am the way to spell chicken."
Bianchi rushed coatless from the
house and jumped on a car. An au
tomobile drew near and Bianchi hail
ed the chauffeur. Into the benzine
buggy he leaped, holding a twenty out
to the tillerman. With a rapid suc
cesion of "toots" the car whizzed down
Market street and over Montgomery.
The carnage at the poultry store was
awful. At first Bianchi thought that
he was entirely chickenless. But a
few of the toughest roosters were
perched on the gaspipes. A lean
Plymouth Rock took refuge on the
cash register and rang up $105 95.
This sum will not cover half the dam
age. The dogs will be executed to
day without trial.

."Washington street. Theee rats, he ex
plained, are in his cellar and not in

dogs that would only bring half price
at a sausage factory and installed
them as night watchmen over his
poultry-
Soon after he left the mongrels be
pan a course dinner. They broke into
;i coop of Shanghais and chewed
Â« hoice cuts out of six. They bit the
heads off the rest because their combs
were lopsided.
The other dwellers in the poultry
store began to equawk for assistance
and a boy ran to the Central police
station. Policeman Pat O'Brien hur-
; ried to the rescue, but the doors were
'locked.
This circle was referred to by the
witness as "the merry-go-round" and
the "session" of the union. The union
men were alleged to have said that
Miller would never get out of the sta
ble alive; that he was. a skulking cur,
and that they would "sandbag him and
beat him to death." Miller declared
further that Secretary Tom White of
the union stood in front of the stable
and said that the watchman was a
State's Prison convict ' and had been
wearing stripes at Folsom/' six weeks
before.
Miller testified that the pickets num
bered from thirty to fifty for several
days, whereas Monroe had previously
testified that he only had a large num

The hearing yesterday In Judge
Hunt's court of the case against the
Stablemen's Union occupied all of the
day. The witnesses were a watchman,
two non-union employes and two
spectators who, under examination by
T. C. Van Ness, attorney for plaintiff
Pierce, told in detail of various acts
of the union's representatives in the
effort to divert patronage from the Ne
vada stable. A patron of the estab
lishment also described an attempt by
the union to have him withdraw his
horses from the barn, which they said
was "unfair."
' The examination of C. P. ' Monroe,
captain of pickets for the union, was
concluded after .Van Ness won from
him an admission that after yester
day's hearing he visited Judge Ma
guire's office and, talked of the case.
Maguire's cross-examination of the
witness brought out the fact that he
was never "attorney" for the union, the
fact having a bearing on Monroe's ex
pressed views as to the legal rights
of unions and employers. Asked con
cerning his Idea of a boycott' Monroe
said it was simply to declare a place
"unfair" and not to do injury, or "slug
or kill a man."
J. E. Miller, watchman for the Ne
vada stable during the strike, was next
called and related various acts of the
pickets and union representatives: He
said he carried arms in the stable be
cause his life had been threatened on
several occasions. He did not know
the names of the men who threatened
him but they had marched in the cir
cle in front of the place.
A MERRY-GO-ROUND.
When General Lauck was made to re
alize, the predicament of the guard. he
at once sought a conference with the
heads, of the traffic department of the
company, but it resulted in no relief
for him.
It was suggested by the railroad of
ficials that the guardsmen leave for
Camp Atascadero Friday evening or
early Saturday morning, which would
permit the company to have its cars
back here in time to take out -the ex
cursionists on Sunday morning. This
proposition met with a protest from
General Lauck, who stated that the
majority of the guardsmen will- be un
able to get away until the closing hour
of business on Saturday. Strangely,
although morchants favor the main
tenance of a State guard, it was shown
yesterday that few of them will grant
their employes, who are members of
the guard, any extra time for instruct
ing themselves in military duties and
would not consent to their men getting
away from their; places of business a
few- hours earlier. â¢ The j orders for the
encampment and the movements of the
regulars and State forces have already
been issued by General MacArthur,
woh is now in the north, and General
Lauck is at a loss for a suggestion as
to how the difficulties can be over
come. <
After two hours' talk it was. agreed
to hold another conference this morn-
Ing at army headquarters at' which
representatives of the ; regular . army,
the National Guard and the railroad
company will be present. Â¦ General
MacArthur has been advised by. wire, of
the troubles here and It is possible that
he may by changing his orders find a
way out of the difficulty.
The national guardsmen have been
planhing^to leave their respective,dis
tricts Saturday for the camp and while
Adjutant General Lauck had not made
any definite arrangements for their
transportation he had reason to believe
that the railroad company would be
fully prepared to accommodate the of
ficers and men. When he called, at the
Southern Pacific offices yesterday, how
ever, he was surprised to learn that
the company wouid not be able to han
dle the men from this cjty and adja
cent country on Saturday evening, Â¦ as
had been planned.
It was explained by the railroad of
ficials that the company had long ago
contracted with various local organiza
tions for numerous excursions on Sun
day, August 7, and that these contracts
would demand the service of all the
available rolling stock of the corpora
tion early Sunday morning at this end
of the line.
Adjutant General J. B. Lauck of the
State National Guard was in conference
yesterday with Passenger Traffic Man
ager Fee, l General Passenger Agent
Goodman, Assistant General Passen
ger Agent Judah and Master of Trans
portation Richardson of the Southern
Pacific ' Company : regarding the hand
ling of the. State troops on the occa
sion' of the coming maneuvers at Camp
Atascadero., It has suddenly. . devel
oped that the railroad company will be
unable to "move the State troops, about
2500 in all, at the time wanted, and as
a result the adjutant general . of the
State is confronted with the perplex
ing question as to how he will get his
forces into' camp on the date prescribed
in .the order issued by General - Mac-
Arthur. Â¦' -Â¦â¢Â¦Â¦Â¦Â¦'.

Julius C. Rels, executor of the estate
of Samuel Davis, filed an appeal from
the arbitrary assessment of $450,000.
Reis states that Dodge had no author
ity to assess the Davis estate arbitrar
ily because the latter had died prior to

to make a statement "was noted by the
Assessor. Reis says that besides stocks
and bonds of unknown value Davis
had $72,000 in bank and $37,138 in prom

The following reductions .were
granted: Â¦ '*
The following petitions were denied
Nellie Pike wanted a reduction on a
lot on Taylor street near O'Farrell
street from $16,050 to $10,000. The As
sessor stated that $25,000 was refused
for the property and the assessment
was reduced to $15,000.
O. H. Von Rhein objected to assess
ments of $26,820 on a lot on Turk street,
near Jones; 32,600 on a lot on Third
street, near Jessie, and $19,820 on two
lots on Jessie street, near Third, claim
ing that the assessed value was three
and a half times greater than last year.
Von Rhein thought the raise should be
more gradual, as leases had been en
tered into based on the old assessment.
Dodge argued that the raise was made
toj agree with the assessment on sur
rounding property and that heretofore
the property had escaped just taxation.
Dodge said that experts had reported
that property in the vicinity had sold
for $2600 per front foot, but he re
fused to disclose the names of the ex
perts, claiming they would be subject
to criticism. The only reductions al
lowed Von Rhein was on the Jessie
street lots from $19,820 to $15,720.
PETITIOXS DENIED.
The first application was Mrs. Julia
Schwartz, who wanted a reduction
from $2530 to $1500 on a sand lot on J
street near the ocean. Upon Dodge's
recommendation the assessment was
fixed at $2000. Dodge said that prop
erty in the locality was unproductive
and the assessment was a little high.
Before proceeding to business Asses
sor Dodge made the following state
ment:
"The assessment is as near uniform
as it was possible to make it, and has
resulted in the raising of more than
one million dollars in taxes for public
improvements without a raise in the
tax rate. If a special tax had not
been levied for bonda the tax rate
would have been so small that I am
sure no property owner would have
appeared here to have his assessment
reduced. I will say that if anyone can
show that he is assessed more than
his neighbor I am prepared to recom
mend a reduction. In all likelihood
the combined State and city tax rate
will be $1 60 on every $100, against
$1 63 last year."
ASSESSMENT TOO HIGH.
The Board of- Supervisors met yes
terday as a Board of Equalization to
hear applications from property own
ers for reductions in assessments as
fixed by Assessor Dodge. The four
members of the State Board of Equa
lizationâMattison. Alford. Beamer and
Brownâ and State Controller Col
gan were present as observers of the
proceedings. In most cafees where re
ductions were wanted on real estate
Assessor. Dodge produced the reports
of experts showing that the market
value of the property was largely in
excess of the assessment.
