SURPRISES
IN EASTERN
ELECTIONS
Democrats Make a
Clean Sweep in
Ohio.
Even the Legislature
Is Wrested From
Republicans.
Supreme Court Will Decide
Who Is to Be Mayor of
New York.
WASHINGTON, Nov. g.â The election
ef John M. Pattison (D.) as Governor of
Ohio, by approximately 65.000 plurality
ever Myron T. Herrick, the present Re
publican Governor; a Democratic work-
Ing majority in both house of the Ohio
Legislature: an immediate appeal of "W*.
R. Hearst, the Municipal Ownership
candidate for the New York Mayoralty, to
the Supreme Court to contest McClellan's
â¢lection in that city on the basis of al
leged evidence of wholesale Illegal acts
at the polls; a plurality of S4SS votes for
"McClellan. and an immediate contest
by the fusionists In Louisville in. the
courts against the election of Democratic
municipal officers and members of the
Legislature, were the developments in
to-day's election aftermath.
McCiellan's plurality is the minimum
Â©n record for a successful Mayoralty can
didate in New York. Hearst's managers
claim evidence of illegal acts against
IPOO inspectors of election and that 30,003
of his adherents wÂ»w- turned- bade -from
the polls because their names already
had been voted.
District Attorney Jerome announced
that fee would make a searching investir
ration of the alleged wholesale frauds
and has ordered the returns from the
Eighteenth and Sixth Assembly districts
to be carefuliv guarded. These are the
home divisions of the Tammany leader.
Charles T. Murphy, and Timothy Sulli
van.
ALLEGED FRAUDS IN KENTUCKY.
In Louisville the fusion party man
agerg claim a non-election in fourteen
precincts because of the disappearance
ef election paraphernalia: that Demo
cratic workers confiscated the ballot
boxes in fourteen other precincts and al
lowed falsification of returns, and allege
activity of "thugs" and repeaters.
All through Ohio the belated returns
ehowed Republican losses and the Re
publicans concede that Pattison's plural
ity reaches 25.000. The Democrats claim
that Pattison's plurality approximates
65,00", which would olect the entire
Democratic ticket. Republicans concede
the Democrats between two and five ma
jority m the Senate and from ten to fif
teen in the House, while the Democrats
claim five in the Senate and twenty-seven
In the House.
The City <refortn> party plurality in
Philadelphia is 43.333 for Sheriff, and the
fusionist candidate for State Treasurer
carried the cily by more than 36,000 plu
rality. The upheaval was the greatest
In Pennsylvania in many years.'
The Maryland legislative situation Is In
doubt.
In Rhode Island the Republican guber
natorial candidate has a plurality esti
mated at 5000, and Providence elects a Re
publican Mayor for the first time in many
years.
MAY DEMAND A RECOUNT.
In Massachusetts Democratic threats
are made for a recount of the vote for
Lieutenant Governor. The Republicans In
Massachusetts gave Â£3.116 plurality for
Guild for Governor, though Draper for
Lieutenant Governor got less than 2000
plurality. The Democrats gained three
Senators and one Representative in the
Legislature.
In Salt Lake the anti-Mormon victory
U made complete by the election of the
entire American party city ticket.
The Kentucky Legislature, which will
â¢lect a successor to Senator Blackburn,
apparently will Include thirty-one Demo
crats, five Republicans and two doubtful
In the Senate, and seventy-nine Demo
crate, fourteen Republicans and seven
doubtful In the House. The Democrats
elected a Mayor In Louisville by about
2500. :..";' : ,
Nebraska, was carried by the Republi
cans. Returns from other States and
cities show no notable changes.
President Roosevelt and members of the
Cabinet received the latest returns from
the various States and cities from differ
ent sources during the day and to-night
and showed keen interest in the results.
Some surprise was evinced here at * the
political revolution in Pennsylvania and
Ohio, and at the close margin of the
Mayoralty vote in New York.

HEARST BEGINS LEGAL CONTEST FOR NEW YORK MAYORALTY
DEMOCRATS OF OHIO ELECT TICKET AND WIN LEGISLATURE
BALLOT BOXES ARE TAKEN
FROM GOTHAM POLICE,
Recount of the Vote East; for Â£ari
didates for City Executive,; -;â¢
GROSS FRAUDS ARE .ALLEGED
NEW YORK. Nov. g.-With the grant
ing of an order by Supreme Court Justice
William G. Gaynor in Brooklyn to-night
compelling Police Commissioner McAdoo
to remove every ballot-box from all the
precincts in Greater New York to the
Bureau of Elections. William B. Hearst,
the defeated Municipal Ownership League
candidate, took his first legal step In a
fight to secure a recount of the votes
ca:->t on election day-
The. order was granted after Justice
Gaynor had reviewed affidavits submitted
by Hearsts attorneys, and a half hour
later CVlouel W. A. S. Bacon and F. W.
Brown, .representing Hearst, served the
cfdtr on Commissioner McAdoo, who sent
out a general order to every precinct in
Greater Ktw York instructing the cap
tains or other officers in charge to send
the ballot-boxes straightway to the Bu
reau .of Elections in Manhattan. Jn sign
ing the order Justice Gaynor said:
The pollcf liave nothing whatever to do with
the ballot boxes, and It is most astonishing
that they chould ha\-e possession of them. They
hay*> no right to even touch them. The orfler
i& granted.
The granting of the order came unex
pectedly and caused much surprise, and,
with the opinion of Justice Gaynor that
the police have no right to the ballot
boxes and should not even touch them, a
new Aspect is placed on the case. This is
the first time such an order was ever is
sued, as heretofore the police have always
bad charge of the ballot-boxes after the
count has been taken at the polling places.
They are removed to the station houses
:mrned!atrly after the inspector* and
clerks have counted up the ballot*.
IVIXS sn)E.Â« WITH HEAnST.
Jvins, the defeated Republican Mayor
alty candidate, was asked to-day by
Hearst to act as his counsel in the light
lie will wage to be declared Mayor. Ivins
refused, but said he would gladly co-oper
ate v.lth the attorneys who will conduct
the right as a.n associate counsel.
Hearst's action met with warm approv
al in many quarters, even among those
who opposed his election, and he received
many assurances of support. District
Attorney Jerome expressed himself in
terms of strong approval of Hearst's pro
gramme'and declared that-he would Im
mediately institute a searching investl
. nation of the alleged" Democratic f rauas.
He also ordered the returns from the
Illghteenth and Sixth Districts to be care
iully guarded.
Ira C. Dan in. the newly elected District
Attorney of Queens County on the Re
publican ticket, made a similar statement.
William M. Ivins, the defeated Repub
lican candidate for Mayor, also commend
â¢ d Hearst's action and expressed. the be
lief that a recount would show that
Hearst had been elected.
TAMMAW ISSUES A PROTEST.
After a 6ecret session of the executive
committee of Tammany Hall this after
noon the following statement was Issued:
The executive committee of the Democratic
â¢â¢rgatiizatlon protests against the outrageous
jublished threat of the defeated candidate of
the Municipal Ownership League to overthrew
;he will of the people as expressed by the
\u25a0v ote cast on election ' day and directs Its law
. ommltte* to exert its oest effort* and takÂ«
.-uch steps and institute euch proceedings as
Mil t=af<-g^iard the ejection of George B. Mc
:'Ulen as Mayor of New York.
We also rail on the Commissions of PoUcw
r ad -the custodian of the ballots to preserve
\,i- tame intact from all interference by any
. n<Â» from any unauthorized eource.
EomÂ« of the Tammany leaders after the
rieeting expressed the opinion that the
! eturns showed censure of Murphy's lead
< rship, and that he . should as a result
i tcp <sÂ«wn and out and make room for a
nan against whom nothing could be
< harged. They thought that it was time
for George B. McClellan- to assume the
leadership himself.
The Hearst leaders said to-day that in
lass 'than twenty-four hours after the
rolls closed the Municipal Ownership
league had secured more than 1000. affi
davits charging illegal acts against about
5000 election inspectors. These affidavits
r late that the inspectors in question were
Vammany men. Hearst himself said that
rrithln a year "a chain of these men
would be Bent to Sing Sing. ~ V^-'

raid to-night that, while doubtless many
:11c gal vctcÃ were cast, he would express
no oDhiion on the contention made by
-.h* .Municipal Ownership league man
agers that they amounted to 30,000. He
'tad made, he said, many arrests, but only
â¢.Dirty of the prisoners were held by the
jnagisi rates. :
Attorney General Mayer paid that he
had information that Illegal votes were
cast in several Assembly districts.
"In any event, however," said the -At
torney General, "even should we discover
thousands of cases of illegal voting it
would not affect the count, for the reason
that the ballots cannot be deducted. So
far as we are concerned our jurisdiction
ends with the prosecution of the criminals
where the crime of illegal voting has been
committed." . ,*v^ Â£-?.

SMOOT'S POWER
WANES IN UTAH
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SALT LAKE,. Utah, Nov. 8. â Senator
Reed Smoot's. political fortunes are â¢be
lieved to have received a death blow in
the Salt Lake City election, which result
ed' in a victory for the Gentile ticket.
The Republican ticket, supported by
Smoot, is a bad third, although the Re
publicans carried the city last fall by
pluralities of more than 3000 on local
candidates . out of. a vote of 23,000.
The Gentile victory is attributed solely
to Smoot's activity,_in the. campaign, dur
ing which he alienated hundreds of Mor
mons and practically all the Gentile Re
publicans of the city. He also has become
a party to a bitter quarrel with his fel
low apostle, Charles W. Penrose, and hag
openly \u25a0 accused Penrose' of prevarication.
The quarrel came as a result of the pub
lication of an official announcement in
the Deseret News, the church organ, of
which Penrose is editor. :
Last Sunday members of the | Smoot
ring scattered thousands of circulars
among the Mormons in an effort to win
support for the Smoot ticket. These cir
culars involved \u25a0 the Mormon Relief So
ciety, a charitable organization which' had
never before figured in politics. Mor
mons resented the action which compro
mised the relief society, and made so
strong a protest that President Joseph F.
Smith of the Mormon church issued . for
mal directions to his people to disregard
the political advice of their church lead
ers. This announcement proved a strong
campaign argument for the Democrats
and aroused Smoot's wrath. He raced
through the voting' districts in an auto
mobile, calling upon the Mormons to
rally to his support, but they spurned
him. It was the first time in the history
of the Mormon church that an apostle
was openly flouted. The circular sent
hundred* of Gentiles from the Republican
party to the Gentile organization, while
the Mormons, rallied behind' the Demo
cratic candidate to rebuke Smoot. ,
It -is understood that charges of , un-
Christian conduct are to be preferred
against Smoot in bis church, based on
his language, his attacks on Apostle.Pen
rose, and the compromising position in
which he placed the church through the
Relief Society circulars. Prominent Mor
mons are openly rejoicing in the victory
of the Gentile ticket, assuming that : it
means the elimination of Smoot as a-po
litical and ecclesiastical factor in . the
State. Republican leaders no less openly
declare that he will" be- relegated by. the
party.

PHILADELPHIA;; Nov.' B.â The' politi

occurred in Pennsylvania in nearly, a gen

heavals, but this is the^tirst time in years
that, every office for. which there was any.
semblance of a contest has been lost to
the regular Republicans. It also; is: the
first time in a" quarter of a'century that
the regular: Republicans I have been /.de
feated for control of the^ State treasury.
Memorable contests ' have been : waged
against the Republicans for the office,
but without success, \ and it is worthy of
note that yesterday's election was the
first that has been held for the place since
the death of former United States Senator
Quay. -/. . . ' ;
The plurality of William H: Berry, who
was nominated by the i Democrats, Indef.

nearly 100,000 and may go above those
figures. J. Lee Plummer, Republican
candidate, ran behind his ticket in, nearly

Department Is
Destroyed.
The Chronicle clock tower, a land
mark by day and a beacon by night,
which was destroyed by fire on Tues
day night, will be rebuilt. The new
structure will be erected on exactly
the same lines as the old one.
But the v/ooden framework, which
WAS fo spectacularly sacrificed to the
fliitnes, will be replaced by v steel edi
fice, copper sheathed â proof against an
other catastrophe such a*3 played. havou
with Sa.n Frax.cisco's i>ioiieer tall build
ing: â a pioneer though it is less than a
score of years old.
Plans for a new steel tower to sur
mount the Chronicle building had been
in hand in connection with the Kearny
strett addition of seventeen stories. M.
U. de Young 1 , proprietor of the Chron
icle, had intended shortly to remove
tJie old tower, but the destruction by
rrc- has hastened his plans in that re
gard.
From the lofty roof huge derricks
were raised yesterday to aid in the dis
mantling of the ruined tower. Throngs
of sightseers pressed against the ropes
strung around the Market-street front
to prevent pedestrians from being hurt
by falling debris. Despite these pre
cautions Hattalion Chief Waters of the
Fire Department and Colonel Smith of
the California Northwestern Railway
narrowly escaped death. A tall chim
ney that stood on the east side of the
tower fell with a crash at noon into
the street, striking the sidewalk and
crashing- through into the basement in
front of the railroad offices at C5O Mar
ket street. Waters had been standing
a moment before the mass of debris
plunged downward ou the spot wheru
:t landed. He was talking with Colonel
Smith; but the pair stepped Into the
office doorway, and suffered only from
being covered by soot, dust and cinders.
TOWER IS IS RUIXS.
When daylight broke yesterday
morning: all that remained of the lofty
clock tower were a few blackened tim
bers and sheaths of copper, skeletoned
in silhouette against the sky iine of
which the high edifice had been once so
prominent a figure. Outlined on the
cast side was the n;etal work of a clock
dial, the hands still hanging on the
!-pindl<*. asTf reluctant to cease their
revolutions. Thin blue smoke, driver,
out of the crevices abound the base of
the tower, blew into space, while gusts
of wind tore around the charred cor
nices, uendins masses of debris flying
into Market street.
The firemen finished their work to
ward daylight, and then places were
taken quickly by salvage crews, a host
of men busy In clearing out the debris
and the water that had piicd up on
every floor In the building.
Clad in heavy rubber boots and coats,
1L H. de Young took personal charge
of things. With his son he arrived in
the morningo nth c first boat from San
Rafael, where word of the fire had
been sent. Survey of the building- dis
closed the satisfactory fact that fire
had done much less damage to the
structure and the newspaper plant than
had been feared when the flames were
licking their way Into the tower and
around tne roof.
The photographing and the etching
department which were established in
a large frame structure on the roof,
were destroyed. Nothing- was left of
the equipment In either one of these
departments, except cameras and lenses
that were saved by employes of the
Chronicle before they were driven out
by the encroaching flames. The fire
was confined to the roof and tower,
De Young: declared yesterday. When
the composing room on the tenth floor
was inspected the linotype machines
were found uninjured. Heavy covers,
reinforced by the tarpaulins of the
underwriters' salvage corps, had saved
the valuable equipment. Even where
fire had burst through a large skylight
in the composing room, firemen work
ing from the Inside had checked its
course.
Much of the water thrown on the
roof leaked through into the compos
ins room, but by afternoon the depart
ment was In working order 6o that
the band typesetters had gone back to
their cases on advertising matter.
Strangely enough, amid all of the fire
and water, not a printer's case was
"pied."
FIREMEN* SAVE THE LIBRARY.
The fear of the Chronicle editors that
the library had been burned was not
realized. Water had seeped into the
room and had done some damage
around the floors, but everything of
value in the large reference room, rep
resenting a systematic collection of
materials for thirty years, was intact.
In the burning: of the zinc room all
of the apparatus, as < well as 25,000
cuts that had been used in the paper,
were burned. This locs Is not Irre
parable* as duplicates of the destroyed
zincs can be made from the reproduc
tions In the files of the newspapers.
One loss that cannot be replaced, and
cannot be measured In pecuniary dam
ages, was^the destruction of forty
years' flies of the Chronicle that were
stored in rooms at the base of the
tower. It bad been the practice to re
serve several copies of each day's issue
of the newspaper, and put them away
for future use. This vast accumula
tion, for lack of other 'storeroom, had
been piled In the tower. . They fur
nished food for the flames for hours.
There was no saving these valuable
archives, and .the proprietor of the
Chronicle said yesterday that he de
plored their destruction more than any
thing else that was lost
That the fire was mainly confined to the
roof and tower was due to the fireproof
construction of the roof. This was built
of cement and tiles, laid, over -. iron' .T
beams. At the upper portion of the ele
vator shaft the burning debris from the
tower made Inroads and burned out some
of the machinery that operated the lifts.

damage from it w^ averted by the play

men having been put at work -to clean
out the shafts and replace the destroyed
parts of the machinery.
WATER DOBSi MUCH. DAMAGE.
Water covered every office floor in the
building, including the business office,
yesterday morning, and i had seeped
through, working considerable damage to
furniture, walls and ceilings. Pumpa
were set at work to clear the submerged
parts of the furnace and press rooms in
the basement. Much of the water that
poured In there was drained off in the
excavation on- the Kearny street side
where the. new building operations are in
progress. M. H. de Young said he could
give no estimate as to the damage to the
building. In conference with John. P.
Young, managing editor of the Chronicle,
he concluded that $10,000 would cover the
loss to the newspaper plant, outside ol
the destruction of the flies and cuts. V
Many of the tenants 'were more or less
damaged by water, but none of them
seriously. In the' stores on the Market
street frontage, Peter Wobber, proprietor
of the Chronicle bar; Henry t Stall &' Co.,
tailors, and Henry Kahn, optician, suf
fered small losses by water.
On the building the losses by, fire and
water will ngure, possibly, well : into
(50,000, as a large amount of repairing
and renovation will be required to. restore
the walls, - ceilings C and floors, besides
the reconstruction of; the roof and tower.
This work, however, wiir be done in con
nection with the â¢ remodeling of portions
of the Chronicle building, .as ; the Kearriy
street addition progresses. So far as can
be learned by the ! Fire Department' the
fire In the tower \u25a0 was â¢ caused by sparks
from exploded bombs and other pyrotech
â¢nics. There were two small flres^ discov
ered on the tower early in the evening,
but these were extinguished' by. employes
of the newspaper. As the wind increased
during the night it fanned lurking sparks
that had lodged in crevices of the wooden
structure. Before attention was' again at
tracted the flames had gamed 'great head
way. As they ate into the - woodwork
they had free swing, for; water could not
be thrown to the top iof the structure.
The â¢ mass of j newspapers gave : the H flre
great headway and the best efforts of the
department were directed toward - pre^
venting \u25a0 the flames from working through
the building. -
TROUBLES OF THE EDITORS.
The editorial of the
Chronicle, headed by Managing Editor
Young and City Editor. Ernesr Simpson,
held \u25a0 forth ; under difficulties ' yesterday
In the Chronicle's business office,' which
was dripping, wet. ? ; Arrangemen ts were
made with 'the publishers of the Bulle
tin to use their plant until normal "con
ditions ; were restored at: home. 1 Young
was of ; the ; opinion-, that; the 1 ". Chronicle
would â¢ be : published as usual in Its own
offices by, to-day."
. "We are : going.; to print ' the ! weekly
edition of .the Chronicle, on. our , own
presses 'to-day," said Young -yesterday,
â¢THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, .THURSDAY, NOVEMBER <>. 1905.
"and I feel satisfied we shall return to
our own offices ready : for operations
to-morrow. Our fears that the median <
ical plant. on. the upper floors had been
destroyed have happily: not been real
ized. What seemed last night to be
masses of flame sweeping through the
upper floor was only the glare and .re
flection of fire. on the. large. glass sky T
lights in the composing rooms. Every
department of, the paper, has been dam
aged somewhat by water, but this" is
being speedily - remedied. We are
working under, some difficulties to-day,

greater."'. part of the afternoon.
At His morning* session Emory Mc-
Olintock. actuary t of the Mutual Life In
surance Company,; who has- been exam
ined, in ;part at previous sessions, was
called 'and continued- his ' testimony on
technical insurance. .
\u25a0In answer to a question, McCllntock
could not -remember a case in wlrtch the
actuary's "department has ever been con
sulted by the officers of the company as
to the amount of Â» money; to be expended
for new business. He was . of the opin
ion the agents' commissions were
larger ' for the endowment policies than
on ordinary life policies with annual divi
dends. Hughes asked Mr. McClintock:
"In 1903 the amount realized by the com
pany wa5? 55,563,861 -'- and \u25a0. the .amount of
dividends; paid; was $725,047; in 1904 the
amount : realized was $6,621,677 and tne
amount of dividends; paid $538,501. Why,
when the ; amount realized ; was V over,
a million .more was the amount set
aside for actual dividends nearly $200,000
ies3? r \u25a0" 'â¢â¢;.â¢ '\u25a0 I"/-*'- 1 : .": \u25a0 \u25a0\u25a0\u25a0.-\u25a0' \u25a0 - ;
McClintock said that the reduction of
interest must be taken into "account. He
also said that as the estimate for the
year's earnings j was made \u25a0in November
and the dividends to be paid were ' cal
culated on the estimate, it was impos
sible to. get accurate results.
\u25a0 In reply to questions, McCUntnck said
that one of the factor 3 considered in
computing"; the diWdends was the "load
ing" of the. premiums so as to provide
funds for the conduct of the company.
What remained of the "loadings" after
payment of 'expenses, he said, .was .de
voted to dividends." The amount of the
"loadings"/ was estimated by the experi
ence^ of- previous years. â¢ .. .. .
McClintock was asked if there was any
way the cost of procuring new business
could" be lessened. ( He replied that the
company "might adopt an ew. method of
valuation. 'He said the ratio of expense;
to the; total Income, of the Mutual Life
Insurance > Company was \ 20 \u25a0 per cent for,
the'year 1904. Â» This, he, said, is also true:
of Othe "New : York : Life . and i Equitable
Life Assurance Society. In the smaller,
companies the \u25a0"\u25a0 ratio was much lower,
in ; some / instances as. low as 13 or 11
per cent. './â¢'. - . '. . \ . '\u25a0 '
The ratio of expenses to the amount
paid to policy holders of the -Mutual'.was
shown to be 19 per cent. In the New
York; Life it is the. same, while in the.
p:quitable it ;is but:4s per cent. In some
smaller companies it is as. low as 29 and
30 per cent.

SUES TO CLEAR
HIS GOOD NAME
Kesenting Accusation That
He Started a* Fire, Harvey
Beckwitn Brings Action
ASKS $5000 DAMAGES
Says George McDonald Has
Spread Bad Reports About
Him Without Good Cause
' OAKLAND, Nov. ' S.â Resenting the
statements that he was the Incendiary
that started the fire on September 19 that
burned out the block between Second and
Third and Clay and Jefferson streets,
Harvey Beckwith, a stationary engineer,
brought a $5000 slander suit to-day against
George McDonald, who, he states, told
Gc-orge Roeth, his former employer, and
George C. Pape of Berkeley, for whom he
is working at the present time, that he
was the man who had starteu the lire.
Beckwith says that McDonald has in
jured his reputaUon as far as his state
ments have spread, and he wants vindica
tion at the hands of the court and dam
ages for the injury done him. He ex
plains that he was employed at Roeth's
mill, where the fire started, and that Mc-
Donald toM Roeth â¢â¢Beckwith is the man
who started the fire and burned you out."
He says he also told Pape, "You had bet
ter look 'out, for that is the man who
burned out Roeth's mill." After the fire
Beckwith says, he went to Berkeley and
worked for Pape in his planing mill.
Fire Warden George McDonald said
to-nipiu when asked about the suit In
stituted by Beckwith: J
Never itv the ..roan In myilife to know him,
and did not know that he was employed In
any. of the building* destroyed In the. fire. If
1 lad ever had any reason to believe that he
was guilty of having: been the cause of the
tire, either through carelessness or intent, I
would not have told any one what I thought,
but would have arrested him at once and found
out whether or not he was guilty by a trial in
court. '
I have , never told Pape "nor any one else
that .Beckwith waa the cause of the fire, and
as for this suit t have 'no idea what caused
him to bring it against me.

GEAHAH SEVERELY
DEALS WITH EROUSE
Holds He Acted in Col
lusion With George D.
' Exposed in his dishonorable attempt to
defeat the- effort of "Mrs. Charlotta E.
Collins to compel. her bigamous husband,
George.D. Collins, to contribute to her
support, Attorney H. A. Krouse . was se
verely dealt with by Superior Judge Gra
ham yesterday. 'Krouse appeared in
court prepared to proceed on the motion
directing Collins to show' cause why he
should not be punished for contempt for
failing to supply Mrs. Collins with funds
for, her maintenance, which motion was
devised by Krouse to betray Mrs. Collins
into the hands of her accused husband,
enabling - him to carry the case to ; the
Supreme r Court. Judge Graham, how
ever, refused to hear him further, and to
his astonishment turned upon him and
said: -
. I simply say, Mr. Krouse, that after a care
ful-consideration of all the evidence adduced
at the formar hearing of. this matter, I find
that thÂ« \u25a0-, proceeding instituted by you was
undertaken by you In * collusion with GÂ«orge
D. Collins, the defendant in . this case, and
that white - you .were ostensibly representing
Mrs." Collins I think, as a matter of fact,
you were ( actlnar [In conjunction with the de
fendant Collins, ; and with this situation con
fronting me. I am 'of the opinion that: the
dignity of. this court, as well as the Interest
of justice demand that this proceeding should
be dismissed and the . order to show cause Is
discharged. ?\u25a0;./ . â¢ ' - â¢ - .\u25a0
Krouse, unabashed, then . sought to
place on the record \ copies of affidavits
that were . mysteriously , lost : after the
last hearing . of ; the ; case, but as the dis
missal of j the order to : show cause oper
ated to end all proceedings, they were not
accepted. Krouse took' an exception to
the ruling of the court and stalked from
the room. ' It is now probable that At
torney Hiram Johnson will again take up
the case against the indicted attorney in
an effort ; to ' compel him to aid the un
fortunate woman and the children jhe so
heartlessly - abandoned. \: ;. ; ..-:..

clared forfeited and a bench warrant

sel for Wright informed the court that
he knew absolutely nothing about
Wright, save that Partridge and Ja
cobs of counsel had Informed him that
Wright, several days ago. had gone to
San Francisco to look for witnesses In

ing about Wright's flight until, in
formed of it by a reporter. He tele
phoned to Partridge at San Jose, and
the latter said he had heard the rumor,
but could not. verify" lt.
district Attorney A. M. Seymour then
read the sections of the codes bearing:
upon the forfeiture of bonds and bail
in criminal cases, and asked that
Wright's bail be declared forfeited.
Johnson asked that action by the
court be deferred till to-morrow to give
Wright a chance to appear, if he U in
the State. Some mistake as to the
date of the trial may have been made
by Wright, Johnson urged.. '
Judge Hart said the court has the
power to set aside an order of for
feiture within twenty days of its en
try, and should Wright appear within
the twenty days he ' could easily set
aside the order asked for by Seymour.
The court then directed that an or
der be entered .declaring Wright's bond
forfeited, and for the present the
Wright case is a closed Incident, from
its legal aspect.
The case of former ' Senator Frank
French, accused of boodling with
Wright, Bunkers and Emmons, was
continued to December 18,, neither side
being prepared to go to trial.
This afternoon Harry Bunkers, a for
mer Senator under sentence of five
years for bribery, was released on
bonds brought to this city to-day by
his wife. The bond was furnished by
the Aetna Indemnity Company of San
Francisco, and was approved by Judge
Hart. _. Bunkers and. his wife, and' child
left for San Francisco in' the afternoon,
after the convicted ' Senator .had ex
pressed his thanks to the* Sheriff's offi

his confinement.

ANARCHY RAMPANT IN CAUCASUS
LOXDOX, Xor. 8. â The Bucharest
correspondent of the Dully ilail says
that atrocities continue In Bessarabia.
The towns of Irmliat and Calariase
have been burned and all the Jews per
ished la the flames.. Iszuaell, the cor
respondent also Â»njÂ», Is In flames and
martial law has been declared. Sixty

ODESSA. Nov. B.â The City Council has
taken measures looking to the investiga
tion of the recent massacres. The coun
cil declared its intention to prosecute
those responsible for the massacres and
appropriated $26,000 for that purpose.
ST. PETERSBURG, Nov. 8. â Pros
pects are growing brighter for a work-
Ing combination between Count de
Wltte and the Conservative faction of
the Constitutional Democrats and tha
wing of the Zemstvoists which was left
behind in the rapid development of ro
form ideas.
The resignation of General Trepoff
and his nomination as post commander
of the imperial palace is generally re
ported in the city to-night. Count le
Witte, who has been In constant com
munication with prominent members
of the Constitutional Democratic party
for several days, and who has steadily
been informed that the dismissal of
Trepoff is an indispensable preliminary
to any co-operation ot that party,
seems finally to have yielded this con
dition.
Count de Witte was favored by a
split which manifested itself in a
meeting of prominent St. Petersburg
members of the party this evening.
While a strong faction declared for a
hard and fast union of Radicals and
Social Democrats until the work of
freedom shall have been completed by
the convocation of a constituent as
sembly, a majority seemed inclined to
oome to the support of Count de Witte,
provided that sufficient guarantees be
given for the carrying out of the
promises contained in the Imperial
manifesto and of Count de Wltte's an
nounced programme in full and in good
faith.
The central figure of the gathering
was Peter Struve, editor of the Osvo
logdenie, the editions of which for
years had to be printed on tissue paper
and smuggled Into Russia in the form
of letters, the mere possession of which
constituted a crime. M. Struve,
strangely enough, is aligned with the
â¢Conservative Democratic party.
Prince Sviatopolk-Mirsky, former
Minister of the Interior, left Kharkoff
to-day for St. Petersburg in response
to a summons by Count de Witte. This
fact has aroused gossip that the Prince
â¢ will be offered a portfolio in the new
Cabinet, but in well-informed circles
doubt is expressed that he will become
one of the Premier's advisers.
M. Guchkoff. a prominent member of
the Moscow Zemstvo. will probably be
named as the first bead of the new
Ministry of Commerce, a ukase creat
ing which was gazetted to-day.
An imperial rescript published this
morning nominated the retiring Minis
ter of Finance. M. idokovsoff, a Privy
Councilor, and announces the bestowal
on that Minister and on Grand Duke
Vladimir and Prince Hilkoff of the
Alexander Nevsky Order in brilliants.
The rescript also announces the reslg- j
nation of General Lobo as Controller ;
General of the empire and his appoint
ment as aid-fie-camp to the Emperor.
Grand Duke Vladimir's resignation
from the post "ot commander of the
eruard and of the military district of
St. Petersburg-, which has been in the
hands of Emperor Nicholas since the
degradation of Grand Duke Cyril, his
eon, on account of his marriage with 1
Grand Duchess Victoria, divorced wife
of the Grand Duke of jiesse, is an
nounced by the Emperor to-day In a
cool and formal manifesto, which re%
fers briefly to Grand Duke Vladimir's
appointment at the wish of Emperor
Alexander 111 and to his desire to re
sign en account of 111 health.
In closing the manifesto contains the
stereotyped expression of thanks for
the Grand Duke's long services.
Another Zemstvo Congress has been
called to assemble at Moscow on No
vember 14, at which the attitude of the
party will be defined. There are indi
cations that it will result in a split
and that the supporters of a constitu
tional monarchy will join Count de
Witte, -while the extremists will lean
toward, if not unite with, the Social
Democrats, who will continue the agl*.
tation for a democratic republic.
The revolutionary wave is beginning to
subside except in the Caucasus. In South
western Russia hardly a city or town es-,
caped Jewish massacres.
At Tomsk, Siberia, according to. the
latest reports received here, the whole
population of 40,000 and the military stood
by while 600 men. women and children
Were burned In a theater. The court
house at Tomsk and the Mayor's resi
dence, where the students and revolution
ists took refuge from the . mob, were
burned, anfl those who tried to flee were
killed in the streets.
The descent of the butchers of Mos
cow with their knives ana axes upon the
students waa onÂ» of the most horrible
chapters, bat not as pitiful, however, as
the attack of the Black Hundred on a
procession of school children carrying red
flags. When the children sougnt to es
cape the police barred the way and the
youthful martyrs were beaten into in
sensibility and in some cases were ac
tually torn to pieces.
Th reports from the Caucasus show
there is no Immediate prospect of sup
pressing tie present state ot anarchy.
Bj.tv.es between Tartars and Armenians
continue and the destruction of the rail
roads and the lack ot troops make it im
possible for the authorities to cope wltn |
the situation.

Root to-day addressed a letter to Simon
Wolf of this city in reply to the-latter's
letter. Secretary Root said:
In reply to your request that/ although you
are cognizant of the fact that the present is
not a lavorable time for intervention or repre
sentation by the United States, the dfpart
ment will, if it can, point out a way in which
it can be of service to these unfortunate peo
ple, I have to say that I quite concur in your
view thst at this Juncture any action by this
Government, looking to the relief of your co
religionists in Russia, would be inopportune
and unavailing. With the hoped-for establish
ment of a more liberal form of Government
and the restoration of administrative control
over the remote \u25a0 scenes of the occurrences
which are so greatly to be deplored, this Gov
ernment may look for a practical resiwnse to
its repeated solicitations of freer treatment of
American Hebrews, and may be in a position
to exert efficient good influence toward the
more liberal treatment of all Jews in* Russia,
and their better protection from the conne
quences of deep-lying racial antagonism. The
problem is one which strongly attracts the
sympathetic attention of this Government.
CHICAGO, Nov. B,â To Insure united
action In giving: financial aid made neces
sary by the massacres of Jews In Russia,
a call to the Jewish people of America
was issued here to-night by Adolph
Kraus, president of the Independent Or
der of B'nai B'rlth, who asks that
funds be sent to Jacob H. SchlfC of New
York.
ST. PETERSBURG, Nov. 8. â Lord
Rothschild of London and Jacob H. Schiff
of New York have cabled $50,000 to St.
Petersburg for the relief of the Jews who
suffered from the recent disturbances.
COACH REID OF HARVARD
> ' ATTACKS COLLEGE FOOTBALL
Famous Player ' Believes the Game
Should Be Radically Changed
or Else' Abandoned.
CAMBRIDGE. Mass., Nov. B.â Coach
William Reid of Harvard, in an open
letter sounds the death knell to-night
of American college football. 'Coach
Reid finds the game too brutal and ap
peals to the alumni of the crimson uni
versity to change it. The letter fol
lows, in part:
To. Mr. D. Merrill. Secretary Harvard Grad
uates' Athletic Association â Dear Sir: After
several years of experience with Intercolle
giate football, after careful consideration of
criticisms which have been made of the game,
and after many honest r. but fruitless efforts to
change it so that these criticisms could be
avoided. I have become convinced that the
game as it is played- to-day has fundamental
faults which cannot be removed by any mere
technical revision of the rules. Although I am
willing: to admit that the necessary roughness
of the game mar be objectionable to some
people, that appears to me to be much less se
rious than the fact that there is a distinct ad
vantage to be gained from brutality . and eva
sion of rules â offenses which, in many in
stances, officials cannot detect, because they
are committed when players and ball also are
hidden from the eyes of the umpire.
Jn addition, it seems to me the influence of
the game and of the conditions which accom
pany the important contests is treason, on play
ers, students, graduates and the publio gener
ally, and is not, on the \u25a0whole, an influence for
(rood. For, these reasons I have come to be
lieve the game ou^ht to bÂ« radically changed
or else abandoned.

ation to one delegation that he was in
thorough sympathy with protecting
Canadian Industry. \u25a0
Cotton manufacturers requested that

said no high-grade pianos were manu
factured in Canada and that the pres
ent duty of 85 per cent was oppressive.
They asked for a reduction.

Fido, Towser, Jack and Bruno have

Something more than race suicide is
depleting j the canine population ) of j the
city and two policemen are detailed to
watch over the stewpot at the Igorrote
village. .
The poundkeeper recently refused an
offer from, the managers of the Igor
rotes to keep the stewpot full.r Fatal
error. The aborigines have been-work'
ing on their own hook and from North
Beach to the Mission comes the wail of
"Where is Fido?" "Where is Sport?"
The stewpot holds the answerâ but not
for long. . . ..

Interesting Exhibition of
the Winton Company At
tracts Many Spectators
Down at Fourth and Townsend streets
the -Winton Motor Carriage Company is
holding a novel automobile show in a
palatial railroad car: which has traveled
4000 miles in the last few months,; being
exhibited at the principal cities of the
United States. The show .here is being
conducted by local distributors of the
Pioneer Automobile Company, of which
E. P. Brinegar, is manager. :
The object of the exhibition is to teach
the public the workings of an automobile.
Every part of a machine is shown :to
visitors. There are two cars, one su
perbly . finished chassis and a full line of
the component parts., Two experts are In
attendance explaining every part of the
vehicle. It is a rare^ opportunity for en
thusiasts to obtain ;an excellent"- knowl
edge of the workings of the machine.
The railroad car in which the exhibition
is being held is palatial in the interior.'
It is richly \ finished in dazzling white,
trimmed with gold. When the 300 electric
lights are turned on it gives' the place an
appearance of regal splendor.
"We are holding these shows," said
Charles B. Shanks of Cleveland, general
sales manager, purely for educational
purposes. We have visited nearly every
large city in the United States and have
instructed thousands of persons. We will
be in this city for four days. Our shows
are given night arid day. We leave Sat
urday night for San? Jose. ., We will also
visit Los Angeles, Fresno, Stockton, and
then on to Cleveland. -> This system of in
structing the public has been a greathelp
to the industry. 'Thousands of. persons
owning automobiles jdo I not Â£ know : \. the
first thine about their mechanism.: It
often - happens an owner ;bf ; a machine
meets with a. mishap on. the road and he
is unable to get assistance ; and. might
have to leave his machine there and walk
many miles for assistance. - With a" little
practical knowledge :he -could make *the
necessary repairs. This is what our show
is for. It is to teach the public and give
them some knowledge as ; to the construc
tionof a machine. ; ,; . }

The Seals are having lots of fun with
the Siwashes. Making runs these days
Is so easy that Uncle's brigade seems
to be tiring of the Job. The article of
baseball the northern stars handed out
at . Recreation : Park yesterday should
be supressed by the Board of Health
as unsanitary. It was more .than a
shame to charge admission for such an
exhibition.
, In the first Inning the Siwashes fell
down. . Miller was slammed for a
couple of hits and . then the fielders
went astray. They began to boot the
ball around the lot to the disgust of
every fan in the place. Two runs came
through quickly and gave the Seals a
start which they seemed to appreciate.
The 'game broke up for fair in the
second spasm. Miller was again tapped
and again his fielders fell down on him.
The Seals stung the ball pretty hard
at times, yet they were not entitled to
the four runs they piled up. Not one
of the Siwash outfielders and but few
of /the Infielders could wing the ball
around. Even the reliable Julie Strelb
had a bad day, making two errors that
helped runs along.
The Siwashes were lucky to get a
run off "Williams. He had everything
required of a pitcher. Miller saved the
honor of his team In the third round,
when he walloped a long two-bagger
to the right field fence, scoring Russ
Hall from first base.
Joe Nealon was again out of the
game with a sore arm. "Wheeler, who
played first, committed three errors.
The Seals did not field as well as they
might, making 1 five mistakes. , None of
these counted, however, while those of
the Seattle bunch all told. The score:

of Supervisors for Line
on Nineteenth Avenue
PEOJECT NOT FAVOEED
Thoroughfare Is Eegarded as
'Boulevard and Only Out
let to Proposed Driveway
It the Parkside Realty Company is!suc
cessful In : securing a franchise from the
Board of Supervisors, | a new; street rail
way. will soon built near the park.
The Parkside concern is >vefy anxious to
run an electric line along Nineteenth ave
nue,: so as to tap a big : tract of land
which it has Just opened bas a residence
district. \" \u25a0\u25a0', '; '"..,. :: ': v ~~'.'v
The proposed road is to . extend along
I street, beginning at j Stanyan street and
run from there to Nineteenth avenue and
to thevOcÂ«an road near Ingleside. : ".
It |is proposed to make Nineteenth ave
nue a boulevard soon, and ;if "this is
done the franchise cannot' be granted.
The avenue has not yet been declared
a -boulevard, though it Is looked upon
as one by, the majority of the residents
of the district and they seem to think
the: Supervisors will soon pass the or
dinance declaring the thoroughfare such.
H. A. Fairchild, , representing the com
pany, . has : been quietly . pursuing : an \u25a0 in
vestigation (with a view to ascertaining
if there was any chance of sueh 1 , a fran
chise being granted by Â£ the ! Board ? . of
Supervisors before formal petition "was
made 'therefor: The company Is opening
a lot â¢of streets south of : the park from
Q to vV streets and Is "â¢ desirous . of " se
curing " transit facilities to a' large tract
which it owns, with a view to Its imme
diate settlement by home seekers. : .
Fairchild has learned during his in
quiries that while Nineteenth avenue had
not . been ; formally - dedicated \as \u25a0\u25a0 a '= boule
vard,' it "is regarded as such / by com
mon consent. It Is highly probable' that
steps will be taken soon to declare Nine
teenth " avenue a boulevard and in that
event no street railroad could be legally
permitted to run thereon. . , .: :
Nineteenth avenue is the only thorough
fare leading to the new driveway to "be
built by the city across . the Laguna de
la Merced Rancho. the land for which
has been deeded to the city by \u25a0 the
Spring Valley Water Company. This is
assigned as an additional reason why
the Supervisors would not allow a street
railroad to run thereon. â¢
I Back of the Venture are Charles E.
Green, secretary and manager of :the
Crocker Estate Company; "W. P. Cope and
Joseph O'Brien, and judging from the
names there is â¢no lack of capital to # ln-f
sure the construction of the proposed
road, that is, if a franchise were to be
put up for sale by -the Supervisors.
TABOO THE USE
OF "FRISCO"
A dozen members lof the^San, Francisco
Real Estate Board ' listened ,' in : open
mouthed astonishment^ yesterday. Â£ after
noon as their" secretary^; Mr. Cadwalader,*
read a communication j from *a; steamship
company in which it was denied j that /on
its passenger lists the name of Ban Fran
cisco had been contracted to ' "Frisco," for
the' board ; has in its possession two lists
of this line -on which the cognomen Vof
this city appears in black : type as .''Fris
co," and they also | had tbe testimony- of
one of ,the ' members ot ; the board I and
Secretary Cadwalader that, they had per
sonal knowledge iof ; lists ' posted in the
smoking rooms of different steamships on
which the unwelcome : andT undescriptive
"Frisco" figured in : connection with the
name of a passenger from this place.
The most interested I member of \' the
board seemed to be President Joslah R!
Howell, .who j had prepared a somewhat
caustic answer to : be forwarded to â¢ the
steamship company! with . the request that
when: San Francisco is mentioned in pas
senger lists it shall be accorded the same
courtesy . that ' is given ', to all other large
cities of the world, j. The value of adver
tising San Francisco was thua brought
forcibly, tp the 'front; and; the members
talked strongly. A communication . was
also before the . board from a local repre
sentative ;of , the steamship line in ; ques
tion, in which assurance] was given that
it should.be San Francisco on the passen
ger lists and not "Frisco" j hereafter. "- :
The Real Estate Board held its. regular
monthly,; meeting "and received a report
concerning . the preparation J of . the general
contract for use in all real estate sales in
the offices of members . of : the board in
this city. President "Howell., urged upon
the â¢ members that J they should be present
at the City Hall' whenTthe elevator ordi

RANDALL MUST
TAKE VACATION
Local Inspectors Punish
Him for Wreck of the
Coasting Steamer St.^Paul
THIED MATE SUSPENDED
Their Licenses Taken Away
for Eighteen Months to
Give Time for Eeflection
Eighteen months' suspension, of li
cense, was the penalty imposed .by
United , States Local . Inspectors Bolles
and Bulger upon Captain C ' Randall
andf.Third Mate William Holmes for
wrecking the steamship St. Paul near
Point 'Gorda, on the California' coast,
October. 5/ 1905. "In their decision; the
inspectors say: ' '\u25a0\u25a0'. '\u25a0'\u25a0. '\u25a0'"' .' . /
From tha evidence we â¢ find that the St.
Paul wat- well found and: In a cood and sea
worthy..-condition; the sea was smooth' and
tha wlnd;l!grht and .that .there waa no: reason
why this ' ship ; should have been , ; run ' on- v.
course \ that \u25a0 would take \u25a0;. her ; so near ito the
land aa was dona on the trip she stranded.
Alter a careful consideration' of the evi
dence In this case -we are satisfied that Cap
tain C. Randall was negligent and unskillful
in navigating the steamship - Qt. - Paul on Oc
tober 6.1W6. in shaping the courae that would
take the vessel so near â¢ to tha \u25a0 land - about
Point : Gorda, and â¢ trusting . that this course
would take * her clear because it i had done so
some trips before and In relying on the Judg
ment or knowledge oi ' the ' mate on the bridge
concerning \u25a0 thÂ« state of the weather andithe
distance ot * thÂ« vessel from - the beach. Also
In not ordering the. Â» course of \u25a0 the steamer
changed mora oft-shore and ; In : neglecting to
take a cast 1 of the lead when he was called
at 2:05 a. m. :by the third mate and , told
by ; him 'that It was rainy ; that he could only
see the loom of the land and that the ship
had run seventy-four miles from Point Arena;
especially .as â¢ he has stated that he knew
tho currents along I this coast i were unreliable
and uncertain; and alsÂ«k in that -the log book
slums that on September 5, when the vessel
had run . sixty-six- mllea from Point Arena
the couree had been changed 12 degrees more
to the westward, evidently T to clear, the ifad-
For reason of such - negligence \u25a0 and^ unsklll
fnlness we hereby suspend the license of Cap
tain C. Randall as maater and pilot of eteam
vessels for the period of eighteen montha. Ves
sel a total loss, value $284,000; cargo a total
loss, .value $168,000; 1M passengers, all saved.
We are satisfied that â¢William Holmes, third
mate. ' was negligent and I unskUlful while _in
charge" of the- watch -on the steamship St
Paul on OctobÂ«r 8.1905. in not being more
vigilant and In not calling the _ master the
second time â¢ when the \u25a0 rain got heavier and

CHINA ON VERGE
OF REVOLUTION
Movement to Overthrow the
Present Dynasty Spread
ing Throughout Empire
PANIC AT TIENTSIN
Japanese Papers Announce
That Emperor Is Being
\u25a0 ; Kept in Close . Confinement
VICTORIA, B. C.. ; Nov. 8.-Telegrams
from Peking to * Japanese papers say
movements to overthrow the 'present
Chinese dynasty are developing with in
credible rapidity. - On October 18 a portion
of . Peking \u25a0 was closed. Foreigners were
allowed to. pass the guarded - gates, but
natives were closely scrutinized. Great
activity of .: revolutionaries is reported
from several sections. A Shanghai paper
cays : a panic * exists at Tientsin . among
native servants, many of whom are leav
ing foreign ; employ \u25a0 owing to the trouble
that is expected. ; ; ;,
Advices from Peking published by Jap
anese'papers received by the ' Empress of
China state that when the Empress Dow
ager of China, returned hastily from her
summer palace because of the bomb out
rage'at: Peking, she summoned the Em
peror and' asked ; what ; he knew of the
outrage, whereupon , the Emperor showed
much , confusion. At ' a . signal from' the
Empress a party, of guards appeared and
led the Emperor to a hall, where he has
bÂ«en sinee 'confined, no one having access
to him' and food being thrust In through
a window. The Hlchi Shimbun says the
Emperor occasionally raises shrieks like
those of a lunatic. ..- .
MINES ARE CLOSING DOWK
BECAUSE OF LACK OF WATER
Unless Rain Fall. Within a Short Time
Many Men Will ' Be Thrown
Out of Employment.
STOCKTON, Nov. B.â Unless rain
falls pretty soon, nearly every mine on
the mother lode will have to close
down, owing to the scarcity of water.
In j many cases .the mines depend upon
water power to .operate the mill ma
chinery, and even where electric power
is- used water is required in the mills,
anyway.
The storage reservoirs upon which Is
dependent the generation^ of electric
current , are getting low, and through
out tho mining region there is grave
apprehension that the worst is to be
expected. In some of the storage reser
voirs the stage of the water,' as It be
comes lower and , lower, is taken with
as much care and anxiety as the rising
of water in the rivers during flood
time. \u25a0 It .'ls declared that in some of
the storage r%pervolrs there is not
enough water to last more than four
weeks longer. ;. â¢
Mills are being shut down dally at
Jackson/ Angels. Amador and other
places along | the lode, and hundreds of
men. are. being thrown out of employ
ment. 'Feed is. also getting scarce,; and
unless - rain falls pretty soon cattle
will suffer.
BODY OP. DEAD PROSPECTOR '

â¢ TACOMA. ' Nor." B.â Nearly half
starved and completely exhausted,
William Kelley, a prospector. ! gave up
his life on Quick River, a tributary of
the Kayuk, which empties ' into the
Norton. Charles Gumper, another
prospector, found . Kelley"* body, â¢ to
gether with a gold watch, a imall
amount of money and a certificate of
membership in the Woodmen of the
.World. , Gumper. covered the: body^with
logs so the wolves would not devour it.
Gumper believes â¢ Kelley was, deserted
by his two partners. Gumper^met a
party several days before the body was
found. The men were then out of pro
visions, but had a rifle and were living 1
upon what they could : shoot. He di
vided his - provisions with them. Aa a
rifle' was not found near the body,
Gumper concluded that Kelley became
exhausted and was deserted.

ROCKING THE BOAT.
SOMETIMES a boat gets stuck in the mud and cannot be
moved by the oars. A good boatman,, under such circum
stances, rocks the boat to let the water under the. keel; and
force the mud out and finally dear the craft so that it may -pass
into deep water. Rocking a boat so situated is good policy and a
proper proceeding, but we, of ten read of the fellow who rocks the
boat when it is in deep water and perhaps in a rapid current. ; The
rocking is not necessary to clear the boat from the mud, for it is
in water deeper than its draft. To rock it is to risk the Hves-of its
passengers. There is always somewhere, however, a fool who will
rock a boat on deep-water, and many women and children' and
some men are drowned because the fool rocks the boat.
Russia is a boat long stuck in the mud. She has not moved
for a thousand years. Motionless in the mud,' her people have seen
in that time the other nations go sailing past, with plenty of water
under their keels. England, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, : once
stuck in the mud, had wise boatmen who rocked them at the- right
time and got them into navigable water, and they* have sailed into
modern civilization and freedom, into parliamentary government,
into popular institutions, and most of them into a separation be
tween church and state, meaning freedom of conscience. But^while
this gallant argosy of nations, rocked out of the mud, has sailed on,
Russia has remained stuck in the mud. Church and state joined,
no habeas corpus, no trial by jury, no freedom of conscience, no
popular institutions, no general education, on that Russian boat
stuck in the mud. Now the passengers have gone to rocking the
boat themselves. They are doing it with frenzied energy and fight
among themselves while they rock. They are not agreed as to many
tilings they want, but they all agree that the boat must be rocked
and get -water under her keel and be made to move out of the mud
that has held her motionless for a thousand years.
These people who are rocking the Russian boat may be frenzied,
they are surely red-handed and murderous, but through the blur of
blood and ashes shines one element of wisdom. The boat needs
rocking and they rock it The water is working under it, and the
embracing mud is becoming solvent and is, washing away/ When
the boat gets in motion > murder will cease, arson .'will' cease, the
crimes of frenzy will cease, and those who rocked the boat will
guide it upon the deep water, and will sail it into the peace and in
stitutions of liberty, like the other nations whose boats rocked
The United States was never fast in the mud. As royal colonies
we had the benefit that came to all Great Britain from being rocked
out of the mud in 1643 and 1688. As colonies we wanted to sail faster
toward a larger freedom, and taking the boat in charge we accom
plished our purpose. Since then we have been on the broad blue
water, with plenty of leeway. But now there are fools who want
to rock the boat. During the recent municipal campaign in New
York Hon. William Randolph Hearst wanted to rock the boat. In
his fight Russia was pointed to as a present example -.worthy to be
followed, and the thousands of recently imported foreigners, but
voters on the East Side, were. told by his speakers that American .and
Russian conditions were similar, and the time had come to rock our
boat.
But Russia is in the mud and we are in deep water. The man
who rocks the Russian boat is wise. He who rocks the American
boat is a fool. In humanity there is am imitative streak.. Some
one commits suicide in a novel manner. Immediately somebody
else, weak of will, who never thought' of suicide before, indulges in
self-slaughter by the same means. People with a just 1 grievance
revolt against tyranny and repression. Others living under free
institutions controlled by themselves rise, wailing that they are
slaves, and chatter of blood and fire. Because one rocks his boat
that is stuck in the mud another rocks his boat on deep water, and
either drowns others, or happily is himself drowned.
This country has stood a good deal of boat rocking since 1896.
Mr. Bryan rocked the boat and scared the passengers. Now Mr.
Hearst is at it, in imitation of Bryan and inspired by the proper
boat rocking in Russia. The passengers are uneasy but are not yet.
in a panic.
NEW PHILADELPHIA.
IN the general political mixup of Tuesday one result gratifies all
decent men. Philadelphia has broken the yoke of the grafters
and emerged into decency and freedom. Many efforts to do this
have been made before, many campaigns for it have been hard
fought, and lost. Repeatedly the reform element has been snowed
under by majorities of 100,000 and the case seemed hopeless. Men
were in despair. The grafters and boodlers spitefully defended them
selves by attacking those who opposed them. So for twenty years
the fight has gone on and boodling and graft won every time and
were "vindicated." But the pitcher that goeth often to the fountain
gets broken at last. Philadelphia is redeemed, because Mayor Wea
ver's conscience revolted and he turned on the crowd that elected
him. When he turned the decent people immediately fell into line
behind him. They hastily organized and nominated a ticket with
out reference to the old parties or their wishes. They' turned
neither to the right nor the left, but went straight ahead and have
redeemed the city by a majority 0^50,000.
In view of all the circumstances this result is .remarkable, and
it will encourage San Francisco and other graft-ridden cities to
persist until deliverance comes. No one can telLthe time of such
upheavals. For many years efforts much stronger and much' better
organized have been made in Philadelphia, but could hot overcome
the indifference of the people. Many concluded from past experience
that success for reform was impossible and refused to take the trou
ble of trying. Suddenly the public conscience is touched, indigna
tioa is roused, and the people who had let many a strong move
ment perish put themselves behind a weak movement and push it
to victory. The time comes, some time.

Story of* an Old
Showman.
( ( rp HE slightest accident will some-
I times wreck the whole evening's
A work of a conjurer," said the old
showman.
"I remember a knockout blow I got in
a small town in Kansas when I was do
ing a bit-in the line of; magic.,; I was
performing the well known trick of pass
ing a marked coin into the center of an
apple-^at least that's what a good many
people were under the delusion I was do
ing. I used a silver dollar, and empha
sized the trick- by passing the coin * into
the pocket of some boy whom I had en
ticed onto- the staee. -\u25a0"-\u25a0"\u25a0.
"Of course, I may as well confess right
here that the boy had to bÂ» a confederate
and that the marked dollar had its fellow
in one previously prepared by me. Ab I
entered the . 'opry : house' . that â¢ night I
looked around for a likely youth to aid me
in my double dealing. I selected my boy
and promised to pass him in if he would
follow my instructions... J
. " 'Son, said I, 'I am a conjurer. I. want
you to put this dollar; in your trousers
pocket," right side. I'll get you a seat in
the front row. When I ask for somebody
to come on the stage you- must come.
Then I will ask you to produce this dol
lar.' i%
"The boy promised to do just as I had
instructed him, and after making arrange
ments for him .at the door, I left him.
When I was ready for the dollar trick -I
saw my young confederate sitting open
mouthed In the. front row. I had pre
vailed upon another; member of the audi
ence to lend me a dollar marked exactly
as the one I had given to the boy.
"I passed that borrowed dollar into. the
apple, cut the fruit open and dropped out
the coin. Then I addressed the house as
follows: - \u25a0 : '
" 'Ladies and gentlemen, I will now per
form a still more difficult feat. I have
passed that dollar Into an apple. Now I
will ask some one in the audience to step
up on the stage, and; without- going any
where near him, I will pass the same dol
lar, ma rked as you have seen! .; into his
trousers pocket' . i / =
"In accordance with hiÂ» instructions the
lad stepped to the stage. I took a position
opposite and! asked:' â¢.-.
" 'Now, young man, have you ever seen
me before?" . - . ,'-\u25a0',: .... \u0084 .. .
" 'No, sir,' was the "answer. , ."
" 'I have here \u25a0 a dollar,' : I continued. . 'I
am -going to pass it into your,; ; trousers
pocket,' right . sidÂ». Oneâ twpâ threeâ go !'.

your hand in your right poc'&et: and. give
me the dollar-, \u25a0 V .-/. \u25a0;';-.\u25a0,-.
"At this juncture, the boy began to look
a little sheeptEhvbut down' he dived Into
his pocket. . Then : to my 2 unutterable , hor
ror and to the unspeakable amusement of
the audience,'. he produced! a handful. of
silver, saying: ~ <

Gentlemen's Sodality of St.
Ignatius Cliurck Prepares
for "SibyPs Prophecy"
PRODUCTION IS LAEGE
Michael O'Sullivan Paints
Beautiful Scenes Showing
the Historical Jerusalem
"The Sibyl's Prophecy," a historical re-
Lgious drama in four acts, adapted from
the classic novel, "Dion and the Sibyls."
by General Miles Keon, will be produced
by the Gentlemen's Sodality of St. Igna
tius Church In the college hall. Van Ness'
avenue, on Monday, Wednesday and Fri
day eveningrs, November 13, 15 and 17.
The first night of the production -will be
under the auspices of the sociality, the
â¢econd niffht under the auspices of the
Young Ladies' Institute, and the third
representation will be taken charge of
by Ignatius Council, Y. M. 1. Xo 33.
The music on all three nights will be
played by Hinrichs' orchestra.
The production is to help to pay oU the
heavy debt contracted by the sodality on
the gymnasium.
The principal scenes of the play are laid
In Rome and Jerusalem.
Michael O'Sullivan, a former student of
St. Igruuios College, has painted a series
of beautiful stage pictures which show
him to be possessed of considerable talent
Jn producing scenes m every way sug
gi stive of rcJinement in color, exactness
In drawing and atmosphere.
The scene revealing the City of Jeru
eaicm from the Garden of Olives is 'a
work of art. The Holy City appears be
yond and the temple with its great dome
er.d many columns and inner and outer
courts is plainly in view.
The palace of Herod and court of Pilate
fere prominent and are surrounded by
irere or less pretentious buildings.
O'Sullivan at all times shows a good
appreciation of color value.
He has done some rare painting and
has tome tine effects, especially in the
ccene of the crucifixion. He is particu
larly strong, too. in his treatment of a
Roman street showing the forum tower
ing ever many other classical buildings.
The transformation scene is especially
effective and presents through an opening
In the clouds the golden gates of heaven
vanishing and disclosing circles of iri
descent angels who disappear while a
group of other angels ascend, revealing
& large golden crucifix, around which are
clustered masses of cherubims and sera
phims.

Evans Writes From South
That Chances Exist in
Chile for New Business
The Pacific Commercial Museum has
embarked energetically on a campaign
to secure to this city trade in South
America and also in Central America.
Acting Director Furlong has collected
and forwarded to Mr. Evans, who is
traveling in South America as the rep
resentative of the membership of the
commercial museum, catalogues of
business houses, printed in both Eng
lish and Spanish, and has entered into
active communication with leading
wholesale houses and manufacturing
establishments in San Francisco to in
form them of the results of Mr. Evans'
inquiries as to the prospects for pro
moting: local Interests abroad. This
was the prime purpose of. the.^ riluseum,
and It" is getting'a great "deal of' atten
tion. *
Mr. Evans has written several let
ters from Valparaiso, in which he sets
forth that the competition of American,
German and British manufacturers and
merchants in South America is now
unusually keen;, and has also impressed
upon the local representatives of com
merce that, while there is a chance to
do business, the prices asked for wares
from this port must be as lo.w or lower
than those afforded by other, localities
to Insure any volume^of business. The
market for sanitary j supplies, for ma
chinery and for meat products and
tinned meats Is described by Mr.
Evans in his latest letter u.b offering
something worth attention In San

OLD CUSTOM-HOUSE. BKING TORN
DOWN TO MAKE WAY FOR NEW
BUILDING.
The old Custom-house has been
turned over to the hands of the de
stroyer. Yesterday j the work of tear
ing' down this famous old landmark
was begun, and it will be continued
until jevery bit of the wood and brick
which was put into the structure with
so much pains and pride by the citizens
of San Francisco in 1854 has been
taken away. Then a new structure,
more magnificent in its architecture
than any of its predecessors, will be
built In its place. The old building-,
hallowed. by the memories- of . pioneer
days, will soon be forgotten. Thus
rules the inexorable law of modern
times. -The old must succumb to the
new, the common give way to the mag
nificent. . -
Happy- has been the history of the
old | Custom-house. , The ouilding was
started in 1853." "The: water's edge was
just at its northern extremity and deep
sea vessels anchored a stones-t hrow,
away. The actual construction was
done by the Government, but! the'citi
zens of San Francisco were bo inter
ested in its welfare that they helped
select the materials and even assisted
in the actual work.
â¢ In 1854 the building was completed.
To San Francisco it was the most mag
nificent of buildings, far surpassing:
every other structure in the city. The
ceilings were finished in handsome
stucco work. The outside brick 4 walls
were covered with brown mastic, a
very popular and handsome exterior in
those days. R. PÂ» Hammond was the
first Collector of Customs to take of
yiuce In the new building.
The groat earthquake of 186S shook
down the llne.stucco ceilings and weak
ened the wall's. The offices were moved
out for a time and the building
strengthened .'with steel stringers.
Wooden ceilings replaced the stucco. :
Those were the days of the free and
easy customs officials. The men did their
work well, but they found plenty of
time to play pranks and entertain their
friends with lively narratives of min
ing experience^. Poker- games were
not Infrequent and a general spirit of
revelry prevailed. As; time wore on
these conditions were slowly changed.
New officials came,, and sterner disci
pline was Instituted. ,
On Saturday at noon the employes
moved over to the new quarters on San
some street and turned over the build
ing to the contractors. Many of them
were young* men,'.'. but some could re
member far back Into .the ; early, days.
The oldest of these was J.VWV Brobas
co, who came into the office in 1861. To
him the leave-taking' pulled -at ; the
heart strings. It seemed like the final
passing: away of f the silent reminder
of the early days. :
The customs , offices now. occupy the
third floor of the Appraiser's building
on Sansome street.? They will, re&iain
there until the new. structure is com
pleted. ;

BTeir York Cotton Market.
NEW YORK. Nov. &.â COTTONâ The fea
ture'of to-day's market was the census report,
which showed 6,544,000 bales ginned to Novem
ber 1. This was plainly more- than the mar
ket had expected, and prices broke 'sharply.
The market held'^falrly well, 'however,, alter
the first drcpt. The trade 'had. beep expecting
no more than 43.000.00C- bales, and -the. showing
of nearly half a million bales more is likely to
bring about a readjustment of crop . ideas In
the near future, and -. estimates were getting
well, under 10*000.000 bales. It is believed
about 50 per cent of the' crop has been ginned
to November 1. and, lt this view is accepted
the Indicated crop Is 10,600.000 bales. It will
be borne In mind 'that- the National Giuners'
Association eald that 45 -per cent of the. crop
had been ginned Up to October 18. . .'Liverpool
is expected to take -the report i somewhat more
bearishly than did the. local market. * \u25a0 V

MORBID CROWDS
VISIT MORGUE
Men and Women, Old and
Young, Stare at Bodies of
Andrews and Nulda Petrie
Crowds of people imbued with mor
bid curiosity stood in front of the
Morgue all day yesterday, waiting their
turn to view the bodies of Milton
Franklin Andrews and Nulda Petrie,
victims of the tragedy at 7^ McAl
lister street on Monday night. A large
proportion were women, young and old.
Borne of whom shed tears as they gazed
upon the body of the unfortunate
woman. The Coroner has not yet. fixed
a day upon which to hold the inquest,
but he will probably do so to-day.
P. B. Johnson, proprietor of tiie lodg
ing-house at 114 Turk street, called at
police headquarters yesterday and told
Captain Burnett that when Andrews

house a month ago last night and en
gaged rooms Andrews pulled a roll of
bills out of his pocket to pay him the
rent. Johnson said he could not say
how much was in the roll, but it was a
very thick onÂ«. They remained in his
house only two nights.
This statement of Johnson cor
roborates the statement of William
Ellis, the Australian, to the effect that
when -Andrews tried to murder him In
the house at Berkeley Andrews stole a
roll of bills of the valu^e of S5OO from
him. The police had been skeptical as
to the statement of Eillis. but Captain
Burnett said yesterday after hearing
Johnson's statement that he believed
Ellis had spoken the truth.
Chief of Police Dinan received a dis
patch yesterday morning from Sidney
Wright, Chief of Police of Holyoke,
Mass.. to the following effect: "Did An
drews leave money or diamonds? Write
answer in detail." Chief Dinan wrote
in reply, detailing what had been found
in the" possession of Andrews. It is
supposed that Chief Wright wrote at
the request of Andrews' brother, who
lives Sn Holyoko.

Clothing*.
BERKELEY. Nov. S.â All the Eteamer
trunks, handsome clothes and other
personal effects left by Milton Frank
lin Andrews when he and Nulda Petrie
fled from Berkeley were taken -ifom
Berkeley to-day by Public Administra
tor Gray and removed under his orders
to a storeroom in Oakland.'
William C. Ellis has laid a claim to
the clothing and trunks which belonged
to the man who tried to murder him.
This claim is in the hands of an attor
ney of Oakland and is to be prosecuted
in the courts when the Public Adminis
trator seeks the" sanction of the court
for the pale' of the property.
I/llis has no documentary evidence'
to prove that these transactions oc
curred, but he insists that lie can
demonstrate his right to all of An
drews' effects, including not alone the
clothing and trunks which Public Ad
ministrator Gray has taken, but the
money and jewelry found on Andrews
and the woman after their death last
Monday night.
The Australian is bankrupt, having
expended all of the $500 he retained
after Andrews* assault upon him in
paying' for the operation upon his frac-^
tured skull and for hpspital and nurses'
charges. He still owes the Roosevelt
Hospital money and is trying, to get
enough to pay his bills and get back
to Australia on the next steamer. -â¢
The clothing left by Andrews in
Berkeley C9nsisted of several trunks
full of expensive suits of clothes,
tailored in LÂ«ondon. all of the highest
class. There are about twenty fancy
vests, each having cost about * $25
apiece
Andrews, in his long: statement ad
dressed to the press before his death,
referred to Ellis* claim on these rlothes
and bitterly resented the idea of Kills
petting possession of the 3tu.T.' An
drews valued the lot of clothing' at sev
eral thousand dollars.* Marshal Voll
merE" estimate is 'that the clothes and
trunks are worth about $1200, although
if sold at auction they might not bring
so much money.

MYSTERIOUS
MURDER OF
SALOON MAN
Patrick McEaughlin Shot l>y
an Unknown iAssassin as
He Watches
Beale and Bryant Streets
DETECTIVES TOABLE v
i : TO SECUKE CLEWS
Several Tlieories ? Incliuling
Attempt at Kobbery and^a
Quarrel Are Advanced, but
Nothing Certain Is Known
The murder of McLaug-hlih,
a saloon-keeper *at 500 Beale street,
which occurred shortly .aftÂ«r,'-7- o'clock,
last ,nig:ht, is. engaging- the attention of
the police, and thus ; far the detectives
have been working In a realm r of my
stery, linable to ascertain who com
mitted the crime or to learn why the
llfe^ of the ; man should have' been
taken. McLaughlin was alone in .his
place of business when he was shot.
The report of ; the pistol was'heard. by
several people, but,' with' one exception,
no person ; witnessed the murderer's es
cape or. can;, throw any flight on-, the
tragedy.â¢ ,"'--.l^-~_~ ': \u25a0>
Perhaps ; the best - , information . the
police have been able to secure is given
by George Cramer/ a cook, who was. at
work in the kitchen" of the" establish
ment, when the' shot was^fired. - Mc-
Laughlin staggered toward the room
in. which ; Cramer, was working and
asked â¢ him to call' assistance from a
coal : yard next door. . Before . Cramer
returned the victim of the assassin's
bullet : had fallen to the floor and con
sclousness gradually left \u0084 him. ; -;, In
twenty minutes he' was dead, lle'made
no. statement nor did he tell anything
that would' give a'clew as to the iden
tity of,his: : murderer. .'
THEORIES OF KILLI.NgV
Several theories' have%becn advanced
as to why McLaughlin was killed. , His
place of business is located on ,a dark
corner, passed ; by, few,; people at... that
hour, of the eveniug.and it is-probable
that ! a* highwayman , committed^Tthe
crime. The last '] people.; tlie detectives
iiave been, able to; interview who were
in the,- place were; two: brothers bf^thef
deceased, .at me _"corner * of
Fremont and Harrison strÂ«ets,"but they
left nearly^ half an hour v . before . the
shooting.' , There is" a ; rum6r. that two
coal Y passers were engaged" in"*'angry
conversation at the bar/just before the
'Shots jj were . fired, but a "sponsor for
this report cannot be found. Relatives
of the deceased are positive tnat the
saloon;-' man -had -no -personal enemies
and scoff at the idea that lie'was killed
by. reason of ; trouble' 1 with any person. \u25a0:'\u25a0'
After ;, the. shot y/as flrcti '. and r . Me
ljaughllri stumbled through the din
ing-rooni " to where Cramer was .at
work, ' the later came back. '.with ; him
as far -as the- front- door of the saloon
and ! left / hlm.S-;,; Cramer rushed ; toY the
Pacific Coast' Coal I Company's yard and
John" Devlin v and 'George : 'Jensen re
sponded to his '"call \u25a0' for assistance. 'They
were hear! by. and heard the shots.' De.v-,
lin- says he saw a man' about' six-feet
tall leave the* saloon immediately, after
the murder and run down Bryant street
to Main. . Several others .who heard the
shot isay thiÃK saw no one 'leave i the
place. \u25a0 . . - . \u25a0:' \u25a0'\u25a0
DETECTIVES IX DARK.
.'Detectives .Bell, Braig, .Taylor, Conlan
and McGowan were detailed on the case'
and questioned - ; tw.o _ brothers -of | the
murdered . man) Charles \ and Â» Daniel.
They had , supper in, the rear of. the
place with their; brother, but they left
about 7 o'clock.- Charles states that he
-was the' last to \u25a0 leave and : that a sailor,
w'hohad been, in the place on the; pre
vious evening, -was standing at; the bar
when he went away! He" does not know
this man's name or. what: ship, he'be
longs :to. He.- had only, a barroom
acquaintanccwith.theman and his.de
scription .is : vague.' "Another witness
has beenfound whosaw.a man sitting
on a" watering; trough near the'i place,
but, -as in the^" first J_ instance/ the' 'de
scription is; so -indefinite that nothing
can be; gained frbm.it. ';
