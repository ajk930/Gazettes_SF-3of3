PREPARING
HIS REPORT
After the exposure Blair's health gave
way. While the trial was pending he
was taken to Florida. He rapidly grew
worse and died there. It was asserted
that Blair took his own ' Hfe, but never
absolutely; proved. All that was -. left to
the widow was the Insurance policy.
ST. LOUIS, , May; 19.â The suit of the
Mutual Life Insurance Company ot New
York 'against Mrs. ' Appolline M. Blair,
widow of the late- James., L.. Blair,' and
other- heirs, of Blair to cancel insurance
policies on Blair's 'life aggregating $200,000,
which the Mutual Company alleged were
obtained under false ; representations,'* has
been dismissed.- This- disposition of. the
suits is believed to indicate; that a settle 1
ment has been reached out. of court. '
James L. Blair was attorney for. the
Louisiana Purchase* Exposition > and was
held in high esteem by. the 1 legal fratern
ity throughout the 'â¢' country before .--his
downfall. His wife, as head of the Board
of Lady Managers, ; also held an enviable
position. Revelations made last * year
shortly before the opening of the fair
Involved Blair in | several questionable
transactions, which indicated: that, his
great fortune had been obtained by fraud.
He was - deprived ; of his position and in
dicted. His wife resigned from the Board
of Lady Managers and in an effort to
right the wrong that had been done sacri
ficed her home, horses, carriages, jewels
and personal effects^

"What does this mean, Is my wife
Uir* I said to Curtis. " 'No,* he an
swered, 'it means that your wife is. In
Omaha and that we've got you where
we want you, and unless you sign the
contract entered into by your wife with
my wife we will have her jailed for
debt and we will throw you Into prison,
too.' Of course, I was alarmed, and,
wanting to get to my, wife's side as
<juÂ£ckly as possible, I signed, the con
tract. Then I asked them to let me go
to my wife, but they told me it was
impossible, as it was against the rules
of the theaters in America for husbands
to travel with their wives. Finally,
however, they gave me a ticket and I
went to my wife, when I heard of ail
that. had happened to her.
"She told me Curtis and his wife had
been maligning me and said that i the
absence of letters from ; me was due to
an affair of mine with another woman
in far away Australia. When I ac
cused them of their perfidy they told me
my wife was drunk every night and
didn't know * what she was saying.
Here -was a pretty: predicament. .1 ac
cused of .. unfaithfulness, â¢my wife * ac
cused of inebriety.' But we had known
each other too long and their, malicious
charges did not convey to either 'of us
even a suspicion of truth.
"Then I found how the financial mat
ters were going. Madame"" Slapoffski
was receiving a salary of $1700 a week.
Curtis took. this, cut it in two, put $850
a week ;In his \u25a0 pocket "\u25a0 and ' then ' paid
ali;of |the traveling and hotel expenses
for. himself, hiswife and Madame Slap
offski-out of her; halfâ at, least , he let
her half go as f ar. as It would.
"We .met Curtis in Auckland, and
knowing nothing about him believed all
he told us. He said he had entered into
negotiations with George Abbott to pro
dute comic operas In Australasia and
â¢w aited Madame to be the prima donna.
I consented â¢ that she should come to
America to sing in concert and see all of
the new comic operas, that she might se
lect those she desired to present. When
Curtis got her over here, however, he told
her that Abbott had repudiated his agree
ment and that Madame Slapoffski, being
without funds, would have to sign a con
tract to tour the United States, Canada
and British Columbia. This was In 'May
of 19M, and in October of that year Cur
tis substituted his wife -as the party of
the first part to the contract.
"Then the trouble began. I received no
letters from my wife and she received
none from me, though we wrote regular
ly. My letters were addressed to my wife
in care of Curtis, and hers were given to
him to mail, so you can draw your own
inference. Finally, becoming alarmed, I
started for America to find out what was
the matter. I went to New York - and
there I met Curtis. He told me ray wife
was in New Orleans and we took the boat
for that city, he paying the fare as I
was without funds. When we drew Into
the pier at New Orleans I observed Mrs.
Curtis awaiting her husband, but my wife
was not there.
THREATENED WITH ARREST.
Sam'l o* Posen. as he was known in
the olden days, M. B. Curtis of to-day,
has grappled in the courts with Elizabeth
Frances Slapoffski, the noted English
prima donna now appearing at the Or
pheuni. Before the judgment comes there
will be told on the stand a tale astound
ing to the histrionic world, for Madame
and her husband are prepared for the
fray. Marie A. Curtis, wife of Sam'l o'
Posen, his alleged . successor to a con
tract under the terms of which Madame
Slapoffski was to sing, when he gave the
nod. up to January 13, IDO7, sued Madame
yesterday for $5000 damages for breach
of agreement. It is alleged that Madame
SiapofTski repudiated the contract on the
Ist inst., retusing to accept an engage
ment to sinÂ£ for seven days in Stock
ton and that hence her agreement to for
feit $5000 should she break the contract
is now in. full force and effect. But
Madame Slapoffski and her husband,
Gustav, known for his genius as an ex
ponent of the great Wagner, have a de
fense' that is startling.
"Repudiate the agreement with Curtis?
Of 'course, we have," said Gustav Slapoff
ski last evening. "My wife has been ter
ribly deceived. Poor little woman, she
was no match for them," and Madame,
who was preparing . in her dressing . room
at the Orpheum for . appearance before
the footlights, nodded agreement with his
view. Madame Slapoffski has given her
years to art. and it was evident from
the most casual observation that . she
would stand as little show with one that
had. rubbed elbows with American fren
zied financiers as an icicle on the beard
of Beelzebub. Slapoffski continued: j
BOOKED FOR TEX-CEXT HOUSES.
"Madame Slapoffski has earned $7000 in
nineteen working weeks and though
Curtis has received all of the money he
says she still owes him $400. Here's
finance for you. My little wife' earn
ing all the 'money, receiving none of it,
and still in debt. And <io you know why
we broke the contract? Because Curtis
booked her to Eing three times a day
for seven days in the Novelty 10-ceht
theater at Stockton. Oh horrors! Seven

The Governer General had recently
been threatened with a bomb attack, par
ticularly since the Mayday disturbances.
Then police accordingly exercise the great
est vigilance whenever he leaves the
castle. After the officials had entered
the cathedral detectives observed a poor
ly dressed man loitering near by. When
be saw the detectives he ran toward
the entrance of a confectionery store,
when he either tripped or threw the
bomb backward at the detectives. The
explosion occurred only a moment before
the people commenced to pour out of the
cathedral. Three minutes later the Gov
ernor General would have passed the
spot. Cossacks who were hastily sum- i
moned soon cleared the streets and the
Governor General drove by another route
to the castle.
The number Injured by the explosion is
twenty-thrpe. Including three women, one
ptudect and two school boys. One of the
latter is detained at the police station,
having been noticed warning" people
against going into Miodowa street. Many
reports are current of straifgers having
stopped poorly dressed persons going in
that direction. Shopkeepers assert the
street was unusually empty at the time
of. the explosion. > \u0084 -
To-day's outrage is the sixth of a simi
lar character in Warsaw, since the Janu
ary disturbances. The editors of Polish
papers here have decided to publish to
morrow, if the censor will permit it,
ttrong articles- denouncing such attacks.
Govefrsor General Maximovitch sent
his adjutant to the hospital this afternoon
with a message of sympathy for the
\u25a0wounded and an offer to take care of the
injured.
Dobrowolski was a member of the vie- !
lent section of the Socialists. Latest re- I
ports stat* that the detectives were In the
act of arresting Dobrowolski when the
bomb exploded and all three were killed.
A revolver and a bundle' of papers were
found in Dobrowolski's pockets.
Many arrests have been made since the
explosion and the police are now busy
rr.&kinsj domiciliary searches.
It is stated that Governor-General Maxi
movitch recently received an anonymous
letter threatening that as he had allowed
men, women and children to be shot down
on Mayday, so he would be killed with
his wife and children, the writer adding
that even remaining within the castle
would not save them from that fate. â¢
WARSAW, Russian-Poland, May 19.â A
Polish shoemaker named Dobrowolski
who was. trying to avoid two detectives
on Miodowa street at noon to-day
stumbled on the curb of the sidewalk and
a bomb which he was carrying in his
pocket exploded, killing him and both the
detectives and injuring many persons who
were passing. It is believed the bomb
was intended for Governor Maximovitch,
who was at the cathedral attending the
services in honor of the Czar's birthday.
A cafe near the scene of the explosion
was demolished, all the windows in the
neighborhood were smashed and a iamp
post was torn out of the ground.
The first report was to the effect that
a bomb had been thrown among local
officials who we^e on their way to or re
turning from the cathedra?, and caused
intense excitement.

PARIS,^ May'l9.â M.' Francois de Loncle
(Republican); Deputy for Indo-China, has
submitted to . the . special Parliamentary
Committee on Naval Affairs' a remark
able > report â¢on the : urgent necessity for
strengthening the " defenses of Indo-China
against the peril. of a Japanese invasion.'
vindo-Chlna," he.says, "has only two
enemies to fear, namely, Japan alone or
China encouraged and supported by Ja
pan. The", former constitutes a real dan
ger, for Japan has much to i gain and
little' to risk, . and her isolated position
makes her almost invulnerable to us. She
could la a few weeks throw 100,000 men
into -Indo-China, and easily reinforce this
first landing j party. The first \u25a0 phase of
such a struggle would consist of Japan's
efforts \u25a0to secure mastery, of/ the sea f in
order to "reinforce her troops. Owing to
Japan's gf eat superiority in naval force
in .. Far' Eastern 'waters our . feeble ..divi
sion would not risk a decisive battle, but
would fall back on our only naval base,
Saigon. â¢; There It would be blockaded as
the Russians were blockaded within Port
Arthur. \u25a0\u25a0 ;
"With our division thus bottled up Ja
pan could oppose the ' junction . of. the
blockaded warships \wlth the relief
squadron, and having - secured the mas
tery Vof the sea .Japanese transports
would be free to land : invading forces." '
The report then examines the : means
which it Is necessary to adopt for the de
fense of the colony, . and . says the best
solution or the problem is to strongly r^
inf orce Indo-China : so "that the colony
may be able to. defend itself for several
months against the ? Japanese until the
French naval divisions reach the theater
of operations/The programme to accom
plish this consists of a large augmenta
tion .of the ; naval â¢ force in the Far East,
an increase of the military force of. oc
cupation to a minimum of 53,009. men, the
establishment of strong naval bases at
Saigon, Kamrarih Bay; Allong Bay and
Pulocondor and tfie establishment of tor
pedo-boat and 'submarine-boat stations at
Cape St. Jamesr, Kamranb Bay arid Tu
ran.-: -'\ ; - ; -â¢-'' ..-'-. .- ".- .â¢\u25a0- .; ' \u25a0â¢' .
. The ..report, concludes by. asserting that
it would be puerile to disregard the grav
ity of. the situation. Therefore it is
necessary to make large sacrifice*' to
place Indb'China in readiness to meet the
shock. , . '. 7
Detallfd estimates are given of the cost
: of the work, the total amount being ?42,
000.000.' \u25a0 -,' â¢ .

Admiral Birileff, who, "in bpite of his
sixty-four, years, is overflowing _wlth en

disciplinarian/ He .expressed ' himself
hopefully over the prospects for the Rus
sians In the coming naval encounter. He
said he believed the Russian Pacinc fleet
was destined to restore, the supremacy of
the sea which* was 'lost at the j very out
break of the war. The departure of tho
new reinforcing I squadron; consisting . of
the battleships Slava and Alexander 11,
two cruisers and a number, of torpedo
boat destroyers and gunboats, the admiral
said, Is fixed forthe middle bf June. /
Vice Aamiral - Verelago has succeeded
Birileff In command of the Baltic station,
but it has not been determined whether
he will take out the new squadron. _â¢
Vice Admiral Birileff' s own departure
will lack the spectacular feature of-thbse
of Vice Admirals Makaroff and Skrydloff

claring his intention \u25a0 of leaving .the city
quietly and without ceremony.

breakdown and of his surrender' of his
command continue in circulation, 'one ru
mor saying that Vice Admiral Nebogatoff,
though Rojestvensky's junior in rank,

mand, but Admiral: Birileu said he had
no Information to that effect.

GIGGLING DISTURBS HDI
Climax Is Interrupted by
Crowd in Dress Circle,
Where, Peace Is Broken
All the indignation in the breast of
talented J. H. .'Gllmour was aroused
Thursday 'evening. while he was play-
Ing Ivan, the character made famous by
Richard Mansfield, in "Ivan the" Ter
rible"at the Majestic Theater because
of the : misconduct of some persons in
the. dress circle. " "*-.-Â£*Â«â¢*'
Refined, serisitlve, polite, Gllmour.
with proper respect for the intense and
dramatic in the character which ho was
portraying-, was interrupted in the mid
dle of the fourth act. the climax of the
great vision scene, by the conduct of
certain young people who were more
familiar with burlesque than with this
masterpiece of the actor's art. Tha au
ditors were so closely interested^ the
play, that they did not notice the ac
tions of a few in the orchestra section.
Not so with Gilmour.
In this scene a terrible ; storm
arose. Reclining on a couch -was star
Gilmour, as Ivan. ..Ghosts of the many
victims of Ivan's cruel hand stalked
across the stage, making the climax of
the play , one of most intense interest.
Then; the giggling broke out^ afresh,
and. with a look of contempt on his
face, Gilmour deliberately walked from
the stage, pausing when near the wings
and repeating tne Shakespearean quo
tation, "What fools these mortals be."
Stage Manager and actor were soon in a
hurried . consultation, but to no purpose,
for Mr. Gilmour would \u25a0 not consent .to
appear before that audience again., and
with this, the ghosts still alone before tha
footlights, the curtain was rung down.
As an explanation ,wa3 due the innocent
people dn actor told the audience that
Misa Adele Block, leading lady with Gil
mour, had Just received a telegram that
her father was dead and that she waa
prostrated with grief, her illness pre
venting a continuance of the play. |As
Miss Block has always been a favorito
the audience left the theater without
complaining of the interruption. .
v Yesterday Manager Bishop and Gllmour
held a council, when the former expressed
his admiration of the actor's courage, so
hereafter ushers will be stationed in tho
playhouse to eject those who have no re
gard for theater etiquette, as well as
those who mistake tragedy for burlesque.

a memorial from the National Fraternal
Sanitarium' Association, the . Supreme
Council, Royal . Arcanum, was to-day
asked to lend â¢ its power and financial
assistance to the , erection of a tuber
culosis sanitarium in New Mexico.
SPRINGFIELD, 111., May 19.âGov
ernor Dlneen has vetoed the bill ap
propriating $25,000 for a . State sani
tarium for the treatment of tuberculosis
patients/ Economy was the ground on
which the bill was vetoed.
WASHINGTON, May 19.â The Nat
ional Association â¢ for the Study and
Prevention of Tuberculosis to-day dis
cussed many phases of treatment and
sociological problems entering into the
disease. One of the points of interest
brought out in this discussion was that
every effort so far made to: establish
self-supporting communities or. settle
ments of tuberculosis patients had
proved a failure.
Nevertheless a partial- support : had
been accomplished under,' carefully di
rected industries in the open air.
It. was the general opinion that 'all
cases of tuberculosis should be allowed
to remain at large where proper <;are
of the patient was maintained and
proper sanitary requirements observed
to protect members of the family In
which the patlenx resided. Nowhere,
except in New York, is there legal 1 au
thority to compel 'the retention of a
patient against his will. Such author
ity, it was argued, is most desirable.
When, Sankey learned from famous
oculists three years ago that his blind
ness : would be â¢\u25a0' permanent, his- old-time
chee rf ulness left him and he became . de

The report of the committee on fra
ternity and union was referred to the
special committee of five appointed this
morning. It will report on Monday, as
no business session will bo held to
morrow.
Rev. At N. Eshman. a prominent
leader of the opposition, said to-day
that the union might as well be con
summated at once, as many would
never *ro into it so long as a line of
the Westminster confession remained,
and stated that ff the union was not
consummate now its opponents would
raise n campaign fund of $25,000 to
defeat it. r
The opponents of union are divided
among themselves, there being radical
and conservative parties. The numer
ous conferences are for the purpose of
laying- plans on which all can agree
It has leaked out that if they cannot
defeat the union they would prefer to
consummate it at the earliest possible
date.
I can annuonce to yoa that the Cumberland
Presbyterian church will bÂ« continued intact
with ltÂ» present doctrine*, whatever the ac
tion or the General Assembly may be. We do
not believe the confession of faith of the Pres
byterian church has been revised, but It Is the
Â«ame as It has been for the last 400 years,
which is fatalistic and predesttnarian.

It is understood that consideration
of the auestion of church federation

appears to be paramount and many
members of the assembly believe it
will carry. Just before adjournment
the resort of the committee on federa

FORT WORTH, Tex., May 19. â Dr. J.

elected moderator, was in the chair
when the second day's session of the
General Assembly of the Southern
Presbyterian Church was called to or
der. .â¢â¢:'. 'A,
The committee on Sabbath observ
ance urged that all forms of sports
and railroad excursions be abolished
on the Sabbath and that Presbyterians
refuse to subscribe for Sunday news
papers. The committee on Christian
\u25a0work among seamen asked that more
chaplr.ins be secured for the navy.
The committee on marriage and di
vorce urtjed that the rule that min
isters refuse to perform marriage cere
monies between divorced people unless
the causes for the divorce are script
ural be continued.
The board suggests that the proper
way to bring about a change for the
better is to disabuse in the minds of
young mea the notion of an over
crowded ministry Every effort should
be put forth, the report says, to bring
about a revival of family instruction
and family worship. A sense of the re
sponsibility resting" upon the church
for the giving of the gospel to all man
kind through the agency of the ministry
should be diligently taught, so that
heads of faiailies, and pastors of
churches, under a sense of this re
sponsibility, may begin to pray wlch
sincere <i*>sirÂ«- and earaestness for a
great .enlarsement of this agency!
Young men should be educated under
influences favorable to piety and not
calculated to shake their trust in the
pJ^tfnry inspiration- -and authority of
the Holy Scriptures.
QIESTIOX OF DIVORCE.
The board believes that there are some
indications of an awakening of the church
to a sense of peril in the present sltua
ttpn. This appears, the report says, from
the appointment of ministers to prepare
papers on the subject and the applica
tions made to the board for accurate in
formation; and further from the way In
which the matter has been presented to
the synods.
A falling off of nearly 33 per cent In
the supply of suitable educated ministers
was reported by the Board of Education.

WASHINGTON/ May 19.-All hope of
the success of the pending negotiations

'Since it became- known 'that' It" was
planned â¢ to" transfer, , the -negotiations' to
Peking and that the Department of Com
merce and | Labor was ; insisting i upon its
own interpretation of the exclusion law.

Two weeks ago last Tuesday he told, his
partners he was not feeling well. He said
he would go away and would be back on

have been rumors that he departed- with
a woman. -
When E. A. Heron, now vice president

fidential man. When Heron withdrew
from active operation Holcomb succeeded
to his business. . He then' organized the
present firm of Holcomb, Breed & Ban
croft, with City Auditor A. H. Breedand
Harold P.' Bancroft as his : associates.
Lately Holcomb has not paid much at
tention to the affairs of the office. -There
is no trouble in the firm and his business
affairs are in good condition. . Holcomb is
possessed of considerable property. :.--.-.*.
Mrs. . Holcomb- has not been seen for a
week and Holcomb's partners are in the
dark as to . the movements of both.; For
years Holcomb was superintendent of the
Sunday school of the First Methodist
Church. ;
City Auditor A. H. Breed, one of the
members of the . firm, said to-night: "I
have not seen Holcomb for two weeks.
At that time he told Bancroft -he: was
going away for a. week. He has been con
nected with our company from its begin
nings but has not given much attention. to
it for some time. His disappearance will
make no difference with the' company,

HALFMOON BAT, May 19 Joseph
F. Francis, Fred Valleio and Manuel
Francis, trustees of the Halfmoon Bay
School District, have decided to call a
mass- meeting of citizens to determine
the propriety of bonding: the district to
erect a new public school building: ade
quate, to the needs of Halfmocn Bay.
The present building is more like a
barn than a schoolhouse and Is detri
mental alike to the Interests of tbe
children and tbe Instructors. Residents
are urging the Immediate need ot a
modern structure.
It is proposed to bond the district
for $20,000, with -which to- purchase
proper grounds and erect a suitable
building. As citizens favor the plan it
is likely that the trustees will be au
thorized to proceed and call' for * spe
cial bond election.
James Seymour, census-talcer for
the Halfmoon Bay district, reports that
there are 312 children In the district.
Of these 294 are native born.
The other speakers and -their subjects
were: The Rev. Dr. George \u25a0 Sweeney,

a magnificent harbor has sprung a city, a
city In name, a city in fact.

BOY OF A'IXETEEA* GIVES SKIX
TO BADLY DI'BXED COMRADE
SAXTA CRUZ. May 19.â The new law
requiring both the prospective bride and
groom to appear before the County Clerk
wnen a license Is wanted, caused Walter
E. Newell; who resides near the summit
of the Santa Cruz Mountains, a great
deal of trouble yesterday.
The bride-to-be was Miss Xellie Beatty,
a niece of Rev. George Beatty, a promi
nent minister of the Methodist church.
The ceremony was to have been per
formed at her home on the mountains,
within 100 feet of the Santa Clara County
line, on the Santa Cruz side. Newell
went to San Jose for his license. There
the officials told him It was necessary to
secure a license In Santa Cruz, as he was
to be married In this county. He took
the train and appeared before County
Clerk Miller, but was disappointed when
he found the license could not be granted
unless the prospective bride appeared. It
was too lat<Â» and there .was no way. to'
communicate with the bride's home,
where everything -was in readiness for
the wedding. ,
The County Clerk advised*- Newell to
take the young lady to San Jose, which
was much nearer the Beatty home. This
Newell would not do. Instead he traveled
to his charmer's home and explained the
circumstances. The bride cheerfully gave
up her plans for a pretty home wedding
and, with her bridesmaid, made the long
trip to Santa Cruz. At the Methodist
parsonage she became the wife of her
persevering iover.

The particulars related by this rep-
resentative citizen of San v Francisco
are similar to hundreds of others in
this city. When there are scores of
people all anxious to tell about the
benefit received from the use of
Doan's Kidney < Pills, the greatest
skeptic in San Francisco must be
convinced. Read the following:
Mrs. V. Powell (.V. Powell.- night
\vaichman) of 272 Harriet St.. says:
"I know of a case of kidncv complaint
- probably due to the contraction of a
cold where Doan's Kidney Pills were
used, and the treatment stooped very
severe aching across the small of the
back. This was some months aeo
and since then there has not been any
indication of a return. I have seen
accounts in our newspapers in San
Francisco of others who were iust as
pronounced in their estimation of
Doan's Kidney Pills as I."

"With the annual tennis tournament for -
the championship of "San Francisco only
ten days off. but little time remains for
thÂ© cracks to get into form. All of the
prominent candidates are practicing daily
and the ' first championship tournament -
of the year shouM be preductive of somÂ«~
clever tennis. -
At Golden Gate Park the cracks aban- '
idoned tournament play some . weeks * ago
and are putting. in every spare moment,
before the- nets. The* honors have- -never
trone to a public court player, but this-,
year George Baker of the Golden- Gate -
Club seems to ,have the best chance " to
wrest the title from Percy â¢ Murdock. ,
Baker will have several clever players to.
[dispose of before he earns the right to. .
challenge , the champion. George Jane*
and Carl Gardner look to be . Baker's .
most dangerous rivals. - â¢ V**Â£
Herbert Long is another young* player,
entitled to consideration. He plays, .a
great same at times In practice, but with
anything at stake' he goes to pieces. " ~,7
. Lonp played a wonderfully " clever
game when , he beat Foley in the- Aca
demic Athletic League tournament. rAs-
Foley Is considered .by many to rank next 8
to Baker at the park. Long looks to have
a chance. Gazdner'ls another player who
does not do cis best in a tournament.
He has .overcome this to an extent^ of r _
lats and plays with, a great deal mora
confidence than formerly.
Neither Janes, Long nor Gardner has
ever beaten Baker in a tournament. .'Ba
ker la a .veteran, whose grams does not '
improve to any extent. Janes has nearly
all of the* qualities necessary to, success
in .tennis. . He has strokes, nerve and
stamina, but lacks delicacy and head
work. When \u25a0he learns that direction is
more Important than speed he will unr .
doubtedly; graduate into, the champion-.;
ship class.' â¢ â r \u25a0 \u25a0 .â-. "
Murdock. the champion,' has had but
little practice of late, but it is. figured he
outclasses, the .other players enough, to
successfully- defend -his -title even if not -
at his -best, if Baker wins the tourna
ment Murdock will have a hard time win
ning if not at his best. If any of the
ether players dispose of Baker, Murdock
should have little trouble winning*. Last
year Schmidt beat Baker, but otherwise
cut little or no figure in the tournament.
The eomingr tournament â¢ will be the
fifth for the championship of the c,ounty.
As yet the title nas>>vÂ«r"beeTt'woti > more "
than once by any player. George "Whit

The baseball committee of the Aca-
J-mlc Athletic League decided' on Thurs
day that the Lowell High School had
not sufficient grounds on which to base
its protest against the Lowell-Wilmer
ding game. This game was won by
Wilmerdlng with a score of 4 to 3. The
chort notice upon which the game was
played made it difficult. for both teams
to procure their scholarship blanks.
The Lowell delegation based, their ob
jection to the game upon this point.
As neither team complied with the reg
ulation of the league Lowell declared
the' game was not an official league
vontest and must be replayed. .The
committee took the stand as '. the non
exchange of blanks was mutually
agreed upon before the game the los
ing team must stand by the result. '

on the card at the Fair Grounds track.
Monte's bad race caused much unfa
vorable comment, but the judges took
no action. Two favorites won Tor the
talent.
NEW YORK. May 19.â August Bel
xnont's grarne filly Tiptoe found new ad
mirers when Ebe carried 122 pounds to
day, conceding ten pounds â¬6 each of
four opponents and then won the Gay
ety stakes under one of the most ter
rific drives ever seen. Her closest op
ponent was Belle of Pequest, and be
tween Oflom, on Tiptoe, and O'Neil, on
Belle of PeQuest, the riding was of the
most vigorous kind. Belle of Pequest
being nearest the outer rail was under
the disadvantage of O'Neil not being
able to whip her with his right hand,
while Odom had full swing on Tiptoe.
Just* near the finish after O'Neil had
Whipped the Belle of Pequest with the
whip in bis left hand, he stopped rid
ing and Tiptoe gradually drew away
from the Belle, finally winning by a
neck. The stake was worth $1610.

SAME DISEASE.
'T^HE Supreme Court of the United States in the case of Ju Toy
I has made the most remarkable decision in the history of that
bench. Ju Toy was born in this country, and had gone to
China to receive an education. On returning here it was judicially
established that he.was*borh here and therefore under the consti
tution is a citizen of the United States. But the -immigration au
thorities ordered him deported, and this order is sustained by the
court.
The decision in effect refuses the writ of habeas corpus to any
one accused of being a Chinese, whether born in this country' or
not, and empowers a merely subordinate ministerial agency like
the Bureau of Immigration to deny a native^of this country his right
of domicile and citizenship and . to penalize him by exile. "This
strikes down the protection of habeas corpus.* No one will pass
judgment on the decision because of its effect on Ju Toy, the victim
of it. But the power which it puts in the hands of ministerial offi
cers may as well be used against any other class of citizens.
The court holds that the decisions of the Bureau of Immigra
tion are not subject to judicial review.! Under that decision a white
man borri in this country can be sent into exile by the immigration
authorities. Thej r have only to say that he is a Chinese and send
him away. The only way? in which he could prove that he is not
a Chinese is by applying for a writ of habeas corpus, to be taken
before a court of law% there to have his status judicially determined.
But this decision denies the writ, and a white native would be en
tirely powerless to prevent his deportation as a Chinese.
The writ- of habeas corpus was devised to prevent just such
things. It put" life, liberty and property" rights in the keeping of
the judicial courts, and was intended to prevent the subjection^ of
either to the authority of ministerial officers. The constitution says
that/ho pefsoh," not "no citizen," but "no person shall be deprived
pf life, liberty or property without due process of law." The Su
preme Court has held time and again that due" process of law is the
judicial process. But it now hands dverfdue process of law. to "\u25a0 d
minor, ministerial iristrurnent of the Government, with authority to
deprive a native born citizen. of his liberty In this ; : country. Sucri a
decision cannot long remainthe law of "the land.

TELEPHONE EAR.
It is discovered that the telephone
is ;: responsible^. for a peculiar develop
ment- of the:- sense of '.hearing. /Most
users of the ' instrument place the; re
ceiver to the left ear, and although the
extra ; receiver f or. . the other ear is to
bet found j in | thousands of offices ; it is
the left ear which I; receives the sound,
and the receiver at the other ear serves
mainly to keep away exterior sounds.
It will be found that an extensive use
of 'the telephone sharpens the left ear
at the- expense of. the right, or vice
versa if you generally make use- of ..the
right ear. ; In the majority' of ; cases
the difference' between the two organs
of hearing is not very great,' but in
some persons it .is alarmingly so. > The
sensitive nerves are so irritated by the
sound coming so directly on them aha
In a tone which is strange that it sets
up "a" reaction which, although 'unno
ticed at the time in all probability, has
accumulative effect and upsets them. U'

The new administration seems determined to devote itself to
the fulfillment of its pledges in that respect. The people are full
of individual enterprise. The residences of Oakland are not second
to any in the State. The private homes are attractive, some of
them exquisitely so. Strangers who drive through the city warm
up to the scene. But fine private residences and grounds should
not be injured by fronting on a dirty street, with unclean gutters,
filled with weeds. The palms set out on the streets,^ to be cared
for by the city, should have attention, and no mean or squalid fea
ture should escape the besom of the new administration."
Heretofore there has been an obstruction to street paving in
the policy of the city government in refusing to accept streets, after
they are paved under official oversight. As the property
pays for laying the pavement for the public to use, it is equity that
the public keep it in repair. As the law puts the means of defense
in the hands of property owners, they natural]}' resist street im
provement which adds to first cost the burden of maintenance. A
public spirited city will encourage citizens to improve their streets
by accepting the work when done and maintaining it at the public
expense, because public use subjects it to wear and tear. With this
policy of equity in force in Oakland, backed by the Mayor's deter
mination and energy, there is no doubt that the next two years will
eclipse the great development of the last two.
This cannot come by playing favorites. The right policy in
municipal improvement is to seek out the parts of a city where
squalor lurks, and purge and cleanse and beautify them. It is ac
cepted as a fact that must be everywhere established, that in the
modern city there must be no encouragement of the slum by filthy
streets or any unsightly surroundings which it is the duty of the
government to remove. It will avail Oakland but little to have
a few blocks of modern streets and perfect sprinkling and gutter
cleaning in a few districts. A town is lifted by treating all of its
parts alike. Oakland has had an object lesson, now let the people
fail in behind the Mayor and march into an attractive future.
npHE people of San Francisco who have civic aspirations look-
I ing to a better future and to a municipal government responsive
*\u25a0 to the public needs and wish cannot be indifferent to the
demonstrations of civic spirit in our neighboring cities. The mu
nicipal government of Oakland during the last two years gave
much attention to the essentials of city administration which are.
v too often neglected. A considerable mileage of the streets was
treated with modern pavement, the streets were more carefully
swept, after the plan inaugurated in San Francisco by the Mer
chants' Association, and the residence streets were lined with palms
and other trees.
These and other items of garnish were immediately followed
by the greatest building boom that Oakland has ever known. Now,
the extension of building in a city is caused by increase in its popu
lation. This requires more residence and business buildings. It is
plain that Oakland received a large accession of population. If one
ask why more people came, the answer is that the city was made
cleaner and more attractive. It had the same mountain and. water
border that it always had. The same sky was above it, and the
same sunshine lit its streets. These things had not changed for
better nor for worse. The attractive change was effected by man,
not nature.
There is nothing in the natural, unchangeable physical features
of a city that can overcome dirty streets, poorly paved, and 'squalid
and untidy conditions. The destiny of every city is in the hands
of its people. They may raise or lower the value of their property
as they please. They may attract or repel population as they please.
They may be sure that so-called natural advantages will 'not alone'
make a city. These are the background and setting for a city, but
/ ma:i must make it. Oakland seemed to proceed for many years
upon the assumption that she was favored of the gods, and men
need not even clean the street gutters. But all this is changed, and
the change produced such astonishing results that the people want
more of it. It built so many new houses, brought into market "so
many building lots, employed so much labor and made a sale for
so much material, that the people do not wish to consider it spent
as a force in their progress. ]
It has induced them to look about and see so much more that
may be done, that what has been done seems inconsequential com
pared with the opportunity to do more. This being so, the little
that seems to have been accomplished, having been so wisely done
that its praises have been sung continuously in the stirring music
of the hammer and saw, the people wanted more, and in electing
another municipal administration they listened to the pledge of the
successful candidate for Mayor to continue the betterment of the
streets and the garnishment of the town. They did not ask any
novelties and experiments, but only that the city government pro
ceed to govern and procure the progressive expansion of the policy
that for two years had made the city a stirring scene of building
activity. â¢ Â»

BANKERS' DEVICES
â¢Some amusing anecdotes are being
told of the devices resorted to by bank
ers, to gain time' and inspire confidence.
On one memorable occasion the excited
subscribers of a Chicago bank, much
to ;their indignation, were only able
to enter the ; bank one by one. except
at the cost of spoiled coats, as the cute
manager had caused the doorposts to
be freshly painted.
.Another .bank . prevented a crisis in
its affairs by exhibiting in the windows
large tubs apparently brimful of sov
ereigns. 'These tubs, however, simply
were upside down,; and only a small
quantity of gold was piled up on their
bottoms. '
But the most ingenious dodge of all
was successfully carried out in , Buenos
Ayres recently. There was a run on
a large bank and for several days sub
scribers besieged the premises, with
drawing money and placing It in an
other bank on the opposite side of the
road. It happened, however, that these
two institutions have a private under
standing, I and as fast as . the "safe"
bank received "the deposits they were
returned to the "unsafe" one by an
underground passage, with the result
that every one marveled at- its con
tinued ability to! meet its demands.

wells: ( '\u25a0". â¢â¢ ' -, '"â¢;â¢;
: "The , world's firsts oil well,"/ he said,
"was sunk in Pennsylvania nearly forty
', years ago. and Pennsylvania has had in
i her time "some wells "of enormous yield.
Compared with the wells of Russia,
though, ours become mere thin dribblers.
"The greatest oil well in the world is
the Droojba of Baku. When this Russian
well began to .yield it .gave forth from
1.500,000 1 to 2,000,000 gallons of oil a . dayâ
an output worth $55,000. ( The oil soared up
to a height |of over 200 feet, a dark-hued
! fountain ' that hissed \ and roared like a
\u25a0 Niagara. With the oil, so much sand was
mingled -that 1 a number of houses and
workshops in the vicinity were buriedâ
vanished out of sight under a mass of
grease-soaked Â« sand. :- Â»}'
"TheDTOOjba oil collected in the form or
lakesâ great, dark lakes, thicker than
cream, on which men rowed in boats and
even hoisted sail and sailed.
\u25a0Â» "The Droojba .well cpuldn't - be con
trolled. For three months its output
couldn't be stored. Hence all that oil
about 150,000,000 gallons-flowed into the
sea and was lost. \u25a0 \u25a0

PIPE SAVES HIM.
Bob Chestnut's visit to town Thurs
day recalls the story of how his cool
ness saved' his life in an altercation
with an Irishman in a Western cattle
camp many years ago, says the Coffey
ville. (Kans.) Journal. The Irishman
was a bully and a bad man. While the
latter always wore a brace of six-shoot
ers in his belt.- he also carried a sud
den emergency Derringer in his outside
coat pocket. The Irishman had an
eleven-inch Colt already in his hand.
Bob thrust his hand in his pocket for
his T * Derringer, but the weapon -\u25a0 had
slipped in a hole in the lining. His
hand coming in contact with his pipe,
he Quickly drew it out and placed It in
his mouth. The Irishman lowered his
gun, which he had elevated when . Bob
thrust his hand into his pocket. Bob
reached for his pocket again, presum
ably for his tobacco. Fumbling around,
he secured * the Derringer, brought it
into play like a flash of lightning â and
they carried the Irishman away. Bob
took a trip' to the British possessions
for his health, although this was hardly
necessary, as the shooting was a nlala
case of. self -defense. *. . â, ..

Delia Fox, the well-known comic
opera star, will make her first vaude
ville appearance in this city at the
Orpheum next Sunday afternoon.
There was\a time, not so very long
ago, when De,\v"olf Hopper, nnd "Wang"
were all the rage in comic opera.. In
the heyday of their glory at that time
Miss Fox, in the role of Prince Mataya,
divided the honors with De Wolf Hop
per. After that Miss Fox starred in her
own company, but was compelled to
retire for a while on account of. a
nervous breakdown, 'fc'he is now thor
oughly recovered, however, and Is one
of the greatest cards in vaudeville.
A prominent Eastern critic said 'of
her a; Tew days ago: "Delia Fox re
tains the piquant mannerisms, the mis
chievous smile the dainty grace and
the Irrestlble -magnetism which j com
bined ;to make her an operatic triumph
as the most: charming and the most
bewitching of all comic opera sou
brettes." , i> '\u25a0 '

The committee agreed that it would be
ultimately necessary jto acquire the
Sjring Valley Water Works plant as a
supplementarj- . system to a municipal
Fupply. Marsden Manson addressed thfc
committee in favor of the proposition,
which he said would have to be submit
ted to a vote of the people, and he ad
vised that course at an early date. Man
sen said the city would certainly have
to go to the Sierras for an abundant
vater supply. Braunhart said that if the
proposition to incur a bonded Indebted
ness to acquire the Spring Valley works
shouia fall at the polls it would be the
death knell of municipal ownership, and
the committee expressed itself as op
posed to its immediate submission.
The committee requested City Engineer
Woodward and Engineers Luther Wag
poner and Marsden Manson to report the
cost of investigating the two offers de-
Fcribed. and also that of the Grant Gap
Company, with a view of determining
their availability as sources of water sup
ply for San Francisco.
J. E. Russell renewed his offer to sell
Â£00 acres at the Junction of the' north
and middle forks 'of the American River
for $4,000,000.

The water rights of the Sierra Nevada Com
r-any embrace tn*; storage of the Blue lakes,
together with the rights on the north, south,

thp Mokclumne River, which Â«treams drain a
water shed of 501 ** so_uare miles and are slt
u*?<>d in a zone of maximum rainfall averag

The storage capacity of these reservoirs is

added the continuous flow of the Blu* lakes,

Attorney A. H. Barendt submitted the
following statement: ,*
ThÂ« Supervisors' Public Utilities Com
mittee yesterday considered the offers of
tlfe Blue I^akes and Sierra Nevada Water
and Power Company and Edward F. Cra
Â£in to furnish a source for a municipal
water supply to San Francisco.
City Attorney Long said that efforts
ere now being made to get from the
United States Government the rights to
a water supply on the Tuolumne River.
Supervisor Braunhart said that the sup
ply named Is deemed the best and most
available and the committee would re
gard it as a fact that the petition for
the Tuolumne rights had not been de
nied, as a new bill on the subject will be
introduced in Congress, which Long said
would be actively pressed, as the PreEi
dent was in favor of It.
Garret McEnerney, attorney for Cra
pfh, said that he did not desire to argue
the merits of the latter's offer, but he
would like to have the properties exam
ined by the Supervisors or their repre
sentatives, who could determine for
themselves whether the supply is a de
eirable one.
Cragin's proposed source is situated on
the headwaters of the South Fork of the
American River, in El Dorado, Amador
and Alpine counties. Just south of Lake
Tahoe. The watershed includes Silver
Lake, Twin Lakes, Audrain lake, the
two Echo Lakes, Lake of the Woods, the
numerous lakes in Devils Basin, called
the Medleys, the Glacier Lake^ and oth
er natural storage basins, cragin says
the normal capacity of the water supply
15 100.000,0000 gallons per day. About $2,
000,000 have been expended on the prop
erties in building . dams, ditches, etc.,
which are largely available for future
use by the city.

The board agreed to take : the subject
under advisement: >Mr. Schwerin pre
sented the regulations as '- recommended
by the automobile Club.; It will be 'the
duty of Commissioner, Rueben.Ji. LJoyd.
to prepare the ordinance. The draft
presented by Mr. Schwerin provides that
the use of automobiles shall be permitted
on the Panhandle main driveway, south
driveway and middle driveway. The ma
chines are not to use the road to Straw
berry Hill, the road to the music stand,
nor tne north bridge driveway. The regu
lations as a measure of safety provide:
"When passing a carriage or pedestrian
from rear to front, it must ue done to
the left and at moderate rate of speed."
Announcement was made by the presi
dent that John Martin of the Bay Coun
ties Electric Power Company had gener
ously agreed to give the park. free of

President Spreckels reported that the

supply Lobos square with water until
June 30, 1906, at 180 per month. The offer
was accepted.
Report was made to the board by Com
missioner Cummings that a plaster-made
Sphinx at the entrance to the Memorial
Museum collapsed yesterday. The Sphinx
was a heritage of the Midwinter Fair,
and went to smash on account of Interior
decay. A companion Sphinx will be re
rroved. The figures of so-called orna
ments in plaster when in a good state
of preservation added nothing to the
beauty of the entrance to the museum,
and the collapse is not regretted.
BIOS ARE CONSIDERED.
Addressing Mr. Spreckels, the delega
tion said: "We hope you will stand by
us, as you have done more than any
one else for the horse. If you desert the
horse we might as well give up and buy
an automobile."
Mr. Morshead remarked that a good
horse could not be driven with safety on
the same road with an automobile.
The delegation of horsemen agreed with
Mr. Schwerin that the automobile had
come to stay, but the point was made
that the horse should not be driven out
by the machine.
President Spreckels said it was proper
that both sides should have a full hear
ing. The Board of Park Commissioners,
after the hearing, would have to act as
referee. >;>â¢ ;
R. P. Schwerin, representing" the Auto
mobile Club of California, was amazed to
hear of the accidents reported by the
horsemen. He fancied that there was
some mistake.- He said that the purpose
of the club was to punish chauffeurs that
violated the ordinance and disregarded
the rights of people on root and in car
riages.
WAXT TO HEAR ALL.
Messrs. Colnon, Magner, Morshead and
White of the delegation addressed the
board, entering .protest against the grant
of unlimited privileges to the automobile.
They insisted that they had no prejudice,
but predicted that the horse would be
compelled to go if automobiles were per
mitted to use every road. It was said
that horses of good blood such as were
frequently driven in the park could not
stand the contact with automobiles.
The Board of Park Commissioners met
at the Palace Hotel, room 1000, yester
day afternoon. President A. B. Spreckels
presiding. Commissioners William J.
Dingee, W. H. Metson, Earl Cumminga
and Superintendent McLaren attended the
session. J \u2666
A large delegation of horsemen, headed
by W. R. Pease, urged the board to
grant no special privileges to automobiles
In the Golden Gate Park. Mr. Pease
spoke of the terrific speed of the autos
in the park, of the odors of gasoljne and
the deposits of grease from the machines.
He said in substance: "In the interest
of the horse I seriously object to giving
up the use of the park to automobiles.
The chauffeurs abuse the privileges grant
ed. They run at a speed of twenty-five
miles an hour. Let us have one road
for horses where automobiles cannot
come. We have been compelle- to aban
don the Ocean boulevard. The talk about
tourists using the machines to view the
beauties of Golden Gate Park is non
sense. Bundled up like Esqu.maus and
going at a fearful rate of speed, the
passengers see nothing."

The trial of. Joseph Rebstock, indicted
by. the Grand Jury for violation of the
election law. by an officer of a primary
election -precinct, was -resumed '.before a
.\u25a0jury, in Judge La wlor's court yesterday.
Most ! of the time was occupied in discus
sions of objections made by an attorney
for the defense to parts of the testimonyj
Frank A. Maestretti," Commissioner .'of
Public Works, was ah interested specta
tor, during the , afternoon. . His presence
seemed to give encouragement to the de
fendant and .his attorneys.
i- '..William H.} Hazel! was called for re
examination. The "Judge overruled an ob
jection that no", questions : "could be asked
the witness regarding defendant's /re
, fusal to administer "the. oath to other
j voters than Owen ,W. Frankum.' Hazell
i then gave the names of several voters
i whose votes he had challenged Sand to
whom ;Rebstock refused . to-, administer
the oath. One of them, named Ahem.
when, his vote was challenged, dropped
his. ballot on the floor and walked out of
the booth. It was objected that this
evidence was irrelevant, but; neither the
attorneys for the \u25a0 defendant , nor the Dis
trict Attorney would move to strike It
out, and after a pause of a minute or
two the Judge ordered it stricken out. .
Owen W. Frankum wanted a. fee of %2
for testifying. He is an inmate, of the
Almshouse. He testified to his , votes be
ing challenged and that no oath was ad
ministered to I him. He said he was a
Democrat, but had. changed to'Schmitz. .
Daniel I* , Fitzgerald and Edward .C.
Harrison corroborated Hazell's . testi
mony as to Rebstock's refusal to admin
ister the oath to 'voters and as to : the
flllhy language - used by . him toward
voters. -. When remonstrated with for not
administering the oath Rebstock would
say, "I'll bedâ d if I'll do it." -
Huber Burr was on the stand when a
long argument ensued as to whether an
inmate of the Almshouse had a right to

Before Coffee Did It's Work.
When you get from food that power
which keeps the heart beating high,
full and regularly, and the nerves firm
and steady, you may say with Monte
Cristo, "The "World Is mine!" â¢
All things that may be attained . by
human endeavor are possible to you.
But if you fill the stomach with
drugs instead of food, you get only an
unnatural stimulation which leaves
you in worse condition than you were
before. Coffee is a drug. In time
that eort of thine wears on you and
wrecks the whole nervous system.
Sure, sure, sure! A lady of Mamaro-
neck, N. T.. tells how she became a
nervous wreck through the use of cof-
fee: , .
"I had 'been, a sufferer," 6he says,
from nervous indigestion for a number
of years and doctored for the same
without result. I was in part to blame,
for although the physician forbade me
the coffee, and limited me to a small
allowance of tea, I failed to obey him,
and continued to use coffee until I
became a nervous wreck. My diges-
tion got to be bo poor that. l was unÂ«-
ablÂ» to oat scarcely anything. I be-
came very much depressed and dis-
couraged over my condition, for I had
no hope of relief, until a little more
than a year ago a friend recommended
Postum Food Coffee.
"I was greatly surprised to find that
the new beverage acted almost ; immedi-
ately and most favorably, upon â¢my
nerves. It certainly is a nerve"; build-
er, at least it has been in my case.l :In
an incredibly short time my nervous
indigestion disappeared entirely, j and
with It has gone the depression "and
"blues" that follow in its train. '
"I am careful to boil Postum ! Coffee
from 20 to 30 minutesâ then,, using
either boiled or condensed milk,, or
cream, the latter preferred, I have , as
delicious a beverage as the old: coffee
at its best, and never feel anything
but pleasant effects from Its use 'and
the old. delight of being, well." Name

APPROXIMATIONS.
"He saJd he loved me," murmured Mrs.
Kate O'Neill, aged 4S years and unable
to conceal a minute of It. The "he" to
whom she alluded ; was Axol Sederholm,
a ; brawny longshoreman, who stood ac
cused of falling to provide for his wife
and three young children, while he be
stowed his wages and smiles upon the
matured Mrs. CNeilJ. She was charged
with having threatened to "fix" Mrs.
Sederholm. lf that lady persisted in de
manding Mr. ' Sederholm's ; exclusive at
tention.
Mrs. Sederholm and her 'babes lived at
25S Shipley street, while Mr. Sederholm
and Mrs. O'Neill dwelt In a Sixth street
lo3ging-houÂ£e. Mrs. O'Neill, who is relict
of a" Chief of Police of Stockton, was ac
companied In Judge Mogan's court by
her married (laughter, and, the younger
woman tearfully implored the "Judge to
deal gently' with her maternal relative/
"It's one of^the'most disgraceful cases
lever heard of," said his ' Honor.' "How
did you become acquainted- -with this
man?"* he asked Mrs. O'Neill.
!'He 'maehedV me': in Columbia : square,"
she reptled,' ."and said he loved \me at
flret eight and \. would . marry ; me "as soon
as he could get a" divorce." , ."
"And you . considered it proper to live
with him , while he allowed â¢ his wife and
children -to starve;
"Ah. Judge,> we" women are weak when
w"8 love." ' sighed . Mrs. O'Neill. "Besides,'
he said If I went back on him he'd kill
me and himself. 7
"And the world would -be better off
After his release from the accusation
of burglary filed against him by John W
Green, veterinary surgeon, Al Howeli
formally charged his accuser with per
jury, but Judge Cabanlss pronounced the
complaint not proved by the testimony.
Mrs. Mary Stowe's husband escorted a
younger and prettier woman to the
butchers' picnic, and when he returned
from the festival to his home on Market
Btree *. between Larktn and City Hall
square, his wife flred potted palms and
other missiles at his head, and Patrol
man Kruger arrested her for peace dis
turbance. Judge Fritz will hear more of
the details next Friday.
Mr. Wallace then testifled that he was
seated upon the back balcony of his
home and engaged in the peaceful pur
tun of cleaning his shoes,- when there
abruptly descended a volume of water
that drenched him. Imagining that an
overhead pipe had burst, he hastened to
his yard with intent to notify the dwell
ers above of his belief, and how the fence
post came to be in his hand was more
than he could explain. When he per
ceived Madame Decotah recklessly delug
ing her plants he chided her for being so
careless cf consequences to the residents
underneath, and she retortea with words
that he would prefer to refrain from
quoting. It was the disgust provoked by
her tirade that prompted him to throw
away the club, which was aimed neither
at \he lady nor the window which It un
fortunately shattered.
"To disbelieve your statement," said
the Judge to the defendant, "would be
to question the reputation for accuracy of
marksmanship enjoyed by the men behind
this nation's naval guns. What is your
present occupation, may I ask?"'

Clements spoke sarcastically Â«f the

knowledge necessary to make rates, and
declared that in the \u25a0 hearings an ; effort
had been made to turn the investigation
into a, criticism of the commission, Clem-
ents. saying that it was not intended in
the proposed legislation to confer general
rate-making - power on the commission.
In answering a. question of ; Senator ' Dol

sion In the maximum: rate; case,* which
held that the power allowed to be exer
cised would give authority; to; fix all

Judson Clements detailed the difficulties
that confronted the commission in its

on that body, particularly "answering a

Gates pointed to the evils that : would
accrue . from the confusion* of "..laws arid
the natural conflict with the Federal
Government in the event of a commission
at Washington attempting to adjust rates

ferent. The railroads, said the speaker,

Gates said that It seemed to be the
policy of some of the Â£tate Railroad Com
missions to manipulate interstate railroad
rates so as to give the wholesale mer
chants and certain kinds of'manufactur

of the business of the' State, thus placing
at a disadvantage, the 'merchants and

of the sentiment of the railroads in .the

road legislation and said to-day before

merce that in his opinion the railroads

crossed in over the bar under pail and
threw out her anchors abreast of Black

down on to the Rlthet, which was lying
at anchor just off Alcatras Island. The
two vessels grot twisted up In great
shape for a while, despite the efforts of
their crrws. . The stmng currents carried
them apart for a moment and then would
swing them together again with great
force. At one period it looked as if the

Alva Udell has again been defeated
in an' effort. ; to gain control of the
estate of aged Juana Marshall, who re
cently startled: the '"police with i~ tale
that unknown enemies had attempted
to poison'^her.* After a hearing in Judge
Graham's "court, at.' the conclusion of
which. th.e ; old .woman .was declared In
competent and the Union Trust Com
pany â¢ named her: guardian, Udell pre
sented a petition, to. revoke- the letters
'of guardianship, claiming that he held
a deed of ."trust \to 'Mrs. Marshall's
estate, in . which one. .'-TV. J. , Gray,. was
\u25a0named with him as co-trustee. ...
â¢ Yesterday 'Udell's "petition ll came up
for hearing before Judge Kerrigan, and,
to' the astonishment of -the petitioner.
Gray appeared and testified' that the al
legation that he was named in any
deed of trust with, Udell was not based
upon fact. He had met Udell but once,
he said, and had never authorized/any
one to use his name as a trustee of
Juana Marshall's estate.
'The result was that tha court prompt
ly denied Udell's petition. Udell still
has one card left in tltte nature of a!
petition to revoke the letters of guar
dianship* over the . person of the , aged
woman. " He saysshe is of sound mind
and body and anxious , to ' take up the
active management of her estate., and
this in 'the face of the -fact that when
she comes to court the old woman . is
supported between two friends, for her
80 years have, deprived her of the
power to, stand alone.' "This last peti
tion will come up: next week..
SUED FOR DIVORCE IN
HIS DECLINING YEARS
Aged Man Hakes Pathetic
Defense to Charges of :
* His Spouse.
After \ forty-three years of married
life, aged Daniel Harris, 111 'and with
out funds, has come Into court to "de
fend the .suit for divorce brought
against him by his wife, Hannah, who
charges him -with failure to provide,
willful neglect and cruelty. The suit la
remarkable in the fact that the' liti
gants have grown from youth to tot
tering age together and have six chil
dren, who are now men and women
well along In years.
Harris expresses astonishment that
his wife -should have sued him for di
vorce, for, he sd!ys, she well knows that
he has been ill and unable to work for
six years and that long ago he retired
from business and since, then he and
his wife have been .\ dependent upon
their children for maintenance. During
the almost half a century of their mar
ried life,- the aged man says, he never
once * treated his wife cruelly \ nor did
he '.neglect her. , his â¢ only offense being
that age and weakness compelled ' him
to " cease '\u25a0' in ; his " efforts to accumulate
worldly goods. ' He asks that her peti
tion for j divorce be \u25a0 denied, believing
that . she soon will repent of her act
and take him back to live with her dur
ing the few years that remain on earth
for them. "â¢;. -. ; ' -.-'\u25a0

I'j- AGAINST APPROPRIATION
Long; Holds That City Cannot Snpple-
ment State's Allowance for
Normal School.
.City Attorney Long filed an opinion
with the Board of Supervisors yester
day in which ha holds that the board
has no right to appropriate'. sso,ooo to
supplement an appropriation , of $150,
000 by the Legislature for the new
State Normal School building and site.
The opinion says: I
In the absence of any State or local law em
powering the municipal autnorltles. much less
obligating them, to contribute to the support
of the State Normal School. I am firmly of. the
opinion that no such contribution can b* made.
Putting aside the matter or location, which I
consider a false equation, no on* would con
ceive it possible for . this city to contribute
from, the revenues to any such purpose. Cer
tainly, no such contribution could be made to
the support of the State Normal .School In San
Jos*, In Loa Angeles, In San Diego or in Cfclco.
No one would have the hardihood to suggest It,
and yet those schools owe their establishment
and maintenance <to the same . authority, the
laws governng them are the same, their course
of study and purposes are the same; and no
doubt they contribute 'as competent teachers
to the State's corps of Instructors as the school
located in San Francisco. \u25a0 . .
The maintenance of a State Normal School
existing under the direction and control of tho
State, as la ' a â¢ State : asylum . or a State fair,
is not related :' to ". the public business of the
city, and county. of San Francisco, - nor a prob
able expenditure of the city and sjpunty - gov
ernment. Not being such it cannot be provided
for In the budget. " â¢ : â¢ \u25a0 - .

effect of considerable orders to sell out. The
f.irt hour proved the most active of the flay.
Tne sharp break In the wheat market save
riFf to the surmise that some of yesterday*
Elerm over the crops may have been unfound
ed or premature. This wu a factor In steady
ing the market for stocks. There mt a dis
position to revise yesterday* ertlmatec of thÂ«
ripnlficance of the withdrawal of the Harrlman
rer-rcsontatlvps from the board of directors in
thÂ» Northern Padfle. Mere Impression was
<-ausfMi by the fact that It was already known
yesterday, indeed, that the Harrlman stock
holdings had been voted for the new directors.
An effect was produced by the report circu
lated during- the session that a. settlement had
rieÂ»n reached of the Chicago teamsters', griev
snes ar.d the strike ended. There were evi
dences of renewed weakness from time- to time.
r>ut (rood support vu encountered. A marked
feature of the movement toward recovery.
however, was the almost total dying out of
the demand before- the general level of prices
rÂ«d quite recovered the losws. This was nota
k!v true of tho United States Steel stocks,
tvhich <-ontlnued a conspicuous center of depres-
Fff>Â» end showed poor resiliancy. There, was some
Â«!lÂ«r<iE!tlon late In the day to discount a poor
Var.k statement for to-morrow. The taking up
oT Government deposits has Involved a loss to
the Gub-trea*ury by the banks of upward o?
58.000.000. while the offsetting sain on the
Interior movement is estimated at only about
t2.000.WV). Some large changes lin the loan
and deposit items are probable, owing to the
larpe financial transactions that have occurred
Â«urtn(t the week. The extreme Â«ase of the
money market to-day, however, precluded any
furious uneasiness over the showing' - by the
rianks. The persistent weakness of the United
Stales Steel stocks infcalred the influence of
thÂ» support In the rest of the market and their
decline to the lowest of the day made the

N'FW YORK. May 19.â Tbe stock market
\u25a0ass subjected to considerable farther liquida
tion to-6ay, but It showed evldeno* Â©f. relief
from the prices and offered some effective re
sistance lo the degression. In the course of.
the declines tbe low prices reached In many
cases were below those touched on the violent
decline In the latter part of April. In no case
was th?re a great extension of the loss beyond
that point and a large proportion of stocks
â¢tt-erÂ» held abova It. Professional operators in
stocks are accustomed to pay great attention
to such aa evidence of renewed pQwer of re
sistance in the neighborhood of the same level
at which a decline was checked not locs be
lore. The trreet of the liquidation durinjr the
course of to-fley for this reason proved very
encouraging- to the professional element. The
*>ar!y liquidation was larce and quite . urgent
and that for foreign account made up an Im
portant element In the market's weakness. It
is - supposed that the extension of sensational
advertising "Smetho<H' followed tn - a recent cam
paign against . stocks' prices -tn this oountry to
the colurrns of foreign advertising mediums
helps to explain the foreign selling and some
special pressure upon thÂ« market attributed to
a Boston orlrln roes to the same source of ex
planation. Yesterday's Tlolent decline* had
