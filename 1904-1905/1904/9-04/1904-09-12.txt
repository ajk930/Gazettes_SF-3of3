The unexpected appearance of ..the
Russian cruiser Lena in San Francisco
bay about noon* yesterday excited un
usual interest and i gave rise to many
questions of international law.
As soon as the news . of the Lena's
arrival became generally known- the
event was the one topic of conversa
tion. There were many guesses as to
her mission and many fears of diplo
matic complications Â¦ between Russia
and the United States.
The big elate colored vessel steamed
Into the harbor with twenty-three slen
der looking rifles looking over her rails,
the blue cross of St: Andrew . on her
white flag waving ominously from, its
staff. She stole slowly out of thethin
fog that hung over the Golden Gate,
her huge hull looming over the water,
and came to a standstill as her anchor
vrcnt down on the bay -bottom off
Meiggs wharf.- , ' :
That flag Is the war standard of holy,
Russia and those : guns, are ' a part of
the Vladivostok raiding batteries. Many
cases of freight along the^ wharves are
shrinking Into the â¢ darkest corners of
the sheds and the exultant ;"banzais"

It was a surprise' that .a Russian
cruiser slipped to the northward of
Kamimura, carried -away; from . the
danger Â¦ zone and \ fotjndt.'a : safe â¢ berth
in San Francisco's open . port. ';,Â¦ Her ap-;
pearance was the * signal for ' all \ kinds

mounted â¢' on . the ; spar ""'deck . = without

BRIEF STOP "AT LJBAU.
WASHINGTON, Srpt. 11.â The Gov

mixed school problem In Indian
Territory. Reports have reached the
Interior Department that some of the
Indians of the Five Tribes are threat
ening to boyiott the new schools which
will bÂ« established in the Territory
this fall if negro children are permitted
to attend. It i3 sr.id that protests from
influential- men in the Territory will
be filed with the Secretary of the In
terior against mixed schools and that
much feeling exists. '
The objection to mixed schools first
came from the ChlckaSaws, who are.
said to take the position that Con

that - the appropriation should be ex
pended on the education of Indian chil
dren alone. -

PHILADELPHIA, Sept. 11.â The Del

from thl3 city to Bristol. Pa., to-night
crashed into a. steam launch ten miles
north of here, grinding it to pieces and
causing the drowning of eight of the
twelve occupants of the small boat. AH

The launch was owned . by Joseph
Fortescue and the party had been
made up of. his friends. The day was
spent in a cruise up the river. The re
turn trip was begun after nightfall,
the pilot keeping close to the Pennsyl
vania shore. When a point near Anda
lusia was reached the Columbia sud
denly loomed up in the darkness. For
tescue jammed his wheel to starboard,
but Just a moment too late. The big
steamer struck the launch squarely
in the middle and cut it in half, throw
ing all the occupants into the water.
.- A panic ensued among the passen
gers on the Columbia. Dozens of life
preservers " were thrown overboard to
4hose -III the -.water and a boat was
quickly lowered. When the rowboat
reached the "spot only, four persons
dould be found in the darkness. It is
believed that several of the victims
Â¦were .crushed by the paddle wheels
on the Columbia.

VANCOUVER, B. C. Sept lLâTo
day's developments in the case of the
robbery of $7000 from a Canadian Pa
cific Railway train fifteen miles east of
here on Saturday night show that the
robbers Bed fur the United States and
are probably now safely across the bor
der.
The robbery was planned to the
minutest detail. After having robbed
the express and mail cars the robbers
forced Fireman Freeman to uncouple
the engine and with it they started for
a point which they named two miles
down the track toward Vancouver.
When they approached the place the
leader said. "Th's is the place," and
ordered a sto;Â». The" robbers clambered
on* together, the leader backing: away
and covering the engineer with his re
volver. "Xow go back to your train," he
commanded, and the engineer and fire
man started back to where their cars
had been left.
This morning' the special train "carry
ing the posse arrived at daylight on the
scene and went over the vicinity with
the firemoT.. The latter showed where
the robbers jumped off. From there the
tracks led plainly along: the railway for
100 yards, then through a field to the
bank of the Fras or River, dose at
hand. Thpre the three had jumped fnto
a boat, which they doubtless had pre
viously preyiuivd. and crossed the river/
On the other side they started for the
international boundary by the Mount
Lehman roa<2, a distance of eleven
ralles. They may have had horses, and
i-c;uld have reached American territory
by daylight to-day.
BANDITS TAP THE WIRES.
The police are watching this district
and inclosing th* roads on all sides, so
that there Ij ttiil a chance of the men
being captured before they reach Blame
Â«r BelUngham. They left nothing be
hind to giv<> the slightest indication of
their identity. Their masks and outer
clothing were either taken away or
runk in the river. The registered mail
sack was carried away.
The mystery is inc: eased by the re
rcipt of a ulegram yesterday from an
unknown sovroe directing the telegraph
operator at Mission to have the express
i 3 gent open the safe. The scheme of this
message was evidently to suggest that
the agent at Vancouver was away, or
for eorae ether reason that the com
bination could not be oo^ned here. The
telegram was signed "D." for the dis
patcher, and is thought to have been
cent by the robbers tapping the wires
and usins their own instruments. The
message was sent from no station
along the route.
The safe was opened, but contained
nothing. The robbers had a bag of dy
namite with which to blow it open if
necessary- The sending of this tele
cram, together v.ith. other circum
stances, Ehows that the robbers were
familiar with local conditions. It is be
lieved the robbers climbed on the blind
baggage at Mission.
Neither the fireman nor the engineer
lieard a sound until the revolver in the
hand of the leader touched the driver's
*-bou!der. When the engineer turned he
found this revolver and two rifles lev
eled at him from the coal tender. The
only man in the train crew who had a
pun was the express messenger, and
lie promptly put it away when the rob
bers appeared at his door with the
muzzles of their rifles sticking into the
ribs of the fireman and engineer.

SAN FRANCISCO," MONDAY, SEPTEMBER -12, ,1904:So. far as, the rights of the individual wage
worker and the individual . capitalist | are con
cerned, both . as . regards one another, as
regards â¢ the Â¦ public, . and . as' â¢ regards organized
capital v and labor, . the < position of .' the ' ad
ministration has . been so clear that there . is
no excuse 'for .misrepresenting it, - and no
ground for opposing it unless misrepresented.
Within the limits' defined by the .national
constitution the national Â¦ administration r has
sought to . secure , to each man " the full ,' enjoy
ment, of his right, to live his life and dispose
of his property and his Â¦ labor as he ' deems
beat, so long . as ; he , wrongs , no one I else. It
has shown in effective fashion that In endeav
oring .to make good this guarantee, it treats
all men; rich or - poor, whatever their creed,
their color, or their i birthplace, as standing
alike before the law. Under our form of gov
ernment the . sphere In Â¦ which . the nation aa
distinguished Â¦ from the - State can f act ' is nar
rowly circumscribed ; . but within ; that sphere
all that could- be done has 1 been 'done.^ -.All
thinking men are aware of the. restriction
upon the power of Â¦ the , National Oovernment
in such matters. Being ourselves mindful of
them, -we' have been scrupulously careful on
the one hand to be moderate in > our promises,"
and ou' the other hand to keep these promises.
In letter - and ' In - spirit. ' t Our , opponenta , have
been hampered - by no such., considerations.
They have promised, and ' many 'of them " now
promise,' action Â¦ which they Â« could â¢ by no ; pbs-"
elblllty take In the exercise of constitutional
power,, and which, â¢ if, attempted, .would : bring
business to a standstill;' they have used, and
often now ure,- language of. wild invective and
appeal: to all the baser passions which tend I to
excite ono set of -Americans against their fel
low-Americans;-and-yet whenever they have
bad- power they have flttinrly supplemented
PROTECTION ABROAD
DEMANDED FOR ALL
AMERICAN CITIZENS
; In closing .what I- have to say about the
system of promoting American Industry let me
add a word of cordial . agreement with the
policy of in some way -' Including within, its
benefits,- by. appropriate legislation, . the Amer
ican merchant marine.. It Is not creditable to
us as a nation that our great export aad Im
port trade should be well-nigh exclusively . In
the ' hands of I foreigners.
It Is difficult to know If <mr opponenta are
really sincere in : their demand for the redac
tion of the army. If Insincere, there is no
need for comment, and If sincere, what shall
we Â»ay in speaking to rational persons of an
appeal to reduce an army of 60.000 men which
Is taking care of the â¢ Interests Â¦ of over
SO.OtiO.OOO people? .The army is now relatively
smaller than it was in the days of Washing
ton, /when on the ptfaoe esUbllslftnent there
were 3C00 ' soldiers, while there were -a little
less than 4,000.000 of population; smaller than
It was In the peaceful days of Jeffers.on,
when there were 5100 soldiers to S.'fOO.coo pop
ulation ' j There Is now one soldier to . every
1400 pecple In this country-r-less than one
tenth of l.per cent. We cannot be asked
seriously to argue as to the amoupt of pos
sible tyranny contained In these figures. The
army as It is. now, Is as small as it Can pos
sibly be and serve t Us purpose as an effective
nucleus for the organization, equipment and
supply of a \Â»lunteer army la time of need.
So it is as between the capitalist and the
wage-worker. Here and there there may be
an unequal sharing as between the two tn the
benefits that have come by protection; .but
benefits have come to both, and a reversal tn
policy would mean damage to both, and - while
the damage would be heavy to all, it would
be heaviest, and it would fall soonest, upon
those who are paid in the form of wages each
week or each month for that .week's or that
month's work.
- Conditions change and the laws must be
modified from time to time to, fit new exigen
cies. But the genuine underlying principle of
protection, as it has been embodied in all but
one of the American tariff laws for the last
forty years, has worked out results so 'benefi
cent, 'Â¦â¢ so evenly and widely spread, . so advan
tageous alike to farmers and capitalists and
worklngmen, to commerce and trade of every
kind, that the American people,' if they show
their usual - practical business sense, will In
sist that when these laws are modified they
shall be modified with the. utmost care and
conservatism, and by the . friends and not , the
enemies of the - protective system. . They can
not afford to trust the modification to those
who treat protection and robbery as synony
mous terms. Â¦
REVERSAL OF POLICY
WOULD INJURE THE
AMERICAN WORKMAN
Similar misrepresentation Is the one .weapon
cf our . opponents^ . in rerarfl to our ' foreign
policy and la the way the navy has been made
useful in carrrinr out this policy. "Here again
all that we ask is that they truthfully state
Â¦what- has been dene, and then say whether or
rot they cbject to it; for If continued in power
wÂ« ehcll continue cur foreign policy and our
handliuc of the naiT en exactly the same lines
In the future as in the past. To what phase
cf our fortiori policy, and to what use of the
cavy, fio our opponents object? Do they object
to the way in which the MorJwe doctrine has
been Strengthened anC ' upheld? Â¦ Nev*r before
has tlris fioctr.ne tÂ»eÂ«a ncquiesced In abroad
us It is now; end yet, while upholding the
rtj-lits cf the weitkcr American republics
against foreign aggrefision, the administration
lain lost no opportunity to pcint tun to these
republics that those . who seek equity should
come with dean hands, and that whoever
< li.in.s liberty as a rig.ht must accept the re
6j on-ilbintU'S that go with the exercise ot the
rig'.it. Do cur opponent* object to what wat

citizens esatnst the Kishinev massacre? or to
the pruteÂ»t aitain&t the treatment of the Jews
In Itoumania? or to the efforts that have beer

No other admin Islration in our history, no

corsiatcrtly stood for the broadest
spirit of brotherhood In our cora

actly as it Is Impossible to call attention to the

Impossible to compare their Â¦ platform with
their other .and later official utterances ' and
not create doubt as to their sincerity. In their
private or unofficial utterances nfttny of them
frankly advance this insincerity as a merit,
taking the position that. as regards the points
on which, I am about' to speak they , have no
intention ot keeping their promises or of de
parting from the policies now established, and
that therefore they can be â¢ trusted not to
abuse they power they seek.
; When we take up the great question of the
tariff we are at once confronted; by the doubt
as to whether our opponents do or do not mean
what they say. They' say that "protection
is robbery." and promise - to carry themselves
accordingly if they, are given â¢ ' power. Â¦ Yet
prominent . persons among' them, assert that
they, do not really mean this and that if they
come Into power they, will adopt our policy
as regards the tariff while , others ;. seem
anxious, to prove that it Is safe to give them
partial power. \ because the power â¢ would ; be
only partial;' and therefore : they would not be

seeking to. obtain control" of the government.
At the outset It is worth - while to say . a
word as * to the attempt to identify : the ques
tion of tariff revision- or tariff reduction with
a solution oftho trust question. This la al
ways a sign of desire to avoid any real. effort
to deal adequately with the'trust question. In
speaking . on this â¢ point at Minneapolis on

"Of. course? If our opponents are not sincere
in j their proposal to abolish -the system of a
'protective/ tariff 'there Is no use. in arguing the
matter at ail; savebypolntlhÂ» out again that
If .on' one* great Issue they do not 'mean what
they say it Is hardly, safe to trust them on any^
other Issue. "But If they are sincere in this
matter, \ then', their -advent , . to , power would
mean domestic misfortune and misery as wide
spread .and far-reaching as. that which we
saw. .ten -years Â¦ago.'-' .When they. speak of pro
tection ' as .''.'robbery," they. of. course must
mean that it Is Immoral to enact . a , tariff de- .
signed (as Is the present protective tariff) . to
secure to the American wage- earner the benefit
of the high standard of living which we desire
to see kept up In this country. Now to speak
of the tariff in this sense aa "robbery," there
by giving it a moral relation, la not merely
rhetorical; It ; is ; on tits face false. . The ques
tion of what tariff Is best. for. our people Is
primarily one of expediency,' to be determined
not . on abstract academic grounds, but In the
light of experience. It Is a matter of busi
ness; for- fundamentally ours is a business
people â manufacturers, '. merchants, j i farmers,'
wage-workers, professional men, all alike. Our
experience as a people In the past has cer
tainly not shown us .that we could
afford -in this / matter to follow those
professional 'counselors who . have con
fined themselves to study in the closet; for
the actual working of the tariff has emphati
cally contradicted their theories. .From time
to. time schedules must undoubtedly be rear
ranged . a-nd readjusted to meet the shifting
'needs of the country;. but this can with. safety
be done only . by those who are committed to
the cause of the protective system. To uproot
and destroy that system would be to Insure
the prostration * of business, the closing of fac
tories, the. impoverishment of the farmer, the
ruin of the capitalist end the starvation of the
wage-worker. Yet, if protection Â¦ is Indeed
"robbery," and if our opponents really believe
what they say, then It is precisely to the de
struction and uprooting of the tariff, and
therefore of - f-ur i business * and . Industry, that
they are pledged. 1 -; When our 'opponents last
obtained power it- was on a platform declaring
a protective tariff "unconstitutional"; and the
effort to put this declaration Into practice was
one of the causes of the general national pros
tration lasting from 1893 to 1697. If a protec
tive tariff Is either "unconstitutional" or "rob
bery," then- it Is just as unconstitutional, just
as much robbery-to revise It down, 1 still leav
ing it protective, as it would be to enact it.
In other words, our opponents have committed
.themselves to the destruction of the protect
ive principle In the tariff, using words which
if honestly used forbid them from permitting
this principle to obtain In even the smallest
degree. '
Our opponents assert that. they believe In
reciprocity. Their action on the most Impor
tant reciprocity treaty recently negotiated â
that. with Cubaâ does not bear out this asser
tion, y Mor<>ovÂ«?r. I there Â¦ can I be no reciprocity
unless there is a substantial tariff; free trade
and reciprocity are not .compatible. We are on
record as favoring arrangements for reciprocal
trade relations with other countries, these ar
rangements to b'.- on an equitable basis of
benefit to -both the contracting parties. The
Republican party stands pledged to every wise
and . ponsl&tent ' method of increasing the for-,
elgn - commerce â¢ of the country. That It has
kept Us pledge is proven.- by the fact that while
the domestic trade of. this country exceeds, in
volume -t>>Â«' entire exDort and Import trade of
all the nations of the world, the United States
has In addition secured more than an eighth of
the exoort -trade of the world, -standing first
among the nat'nnn in thla respect. The United
States has exported during the last seven years
nearly ten Â¦ billions of. dollars' worth - of goods
â on an -average Half as much again annually
as during the previous Icur years, when many
of our people "were consuming nothing but nec
essaries, and ' some '. of . them, a scanty supply
even of these. . - Â¦ . . â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢
Two years aco, speaking at Logansport, In
diana, I said :c - "- Â¦ Â¦ .
"The one consideration which must never be
omitted In - a . tariff - change is the Imperative
need of prtsarvlnir. the American standard of

IRRIGATION PLANS
ARE FRAUGHT WITH
FAR^EACHING GOOD
In addition to those acts at the administra
tion which they venture to assail only after
misrepresenting them, there are others which
they dare not overtly or officially attack and
yet which they covertly bring forward as rea
sons for the* overthrow of the party. In cer
tain great centers and with certain great In
terests our* opponents ' make every effort to
show that the settlement of the anthracite
ocal strike by the individual act of the Presi
dent and the successful suit against the North
ern Securities Company â the merger suit â un
dertaken by the Department of Justice, were
sets because of which the present administra
tion should be thrown from power. Yet they
dare net openly condemn either act. They
dare not in. any authoritative or formal man
ner say that In either case wrong was done
or error committed in the method of action
or In the choice of instruments for putting
that action Into effect. But what they dare
not manfully assert In open day they seek to
use furtively and through special agents. It
is perhaps natural that an attack so conducted
thould be made sometimes on the ground
that too much, sometimes on the ground that
too little, has been done. Soms of our op
ponents complain because under the anti-trust
ar.d interstate commerce laws suits were un
dertaken which have been successful; ethers,
because suits were not undertaken which
would have been unsuccessful. The Demo
cratic State Convention in New York dealt
with the anthracite coal strike by demanding
In deliberate and formal fashion that the Xa
tiocal Government should take possession of
the coal fields; yet champions of that con
vention's cause now condemn the fact that
there was any action by the President at all â
though they must know that it was only this
action by the President which prevented the
movement for national ownership of the coal
fields from gaining what might well have
been an Irresistible Impetus. Such mutually
destructive criticisms furnish an adequate
measure of the chance . for coherent . action
or constructive legislation If our opponents
should be given Dower.
So much for what our opponents openly . or
covertly advance in the way ot an' attack on
the acts of the administration. When we
come to consider the Dolicles- for- which they
profess to stand we are met with the difficulty
always arising when statements of policy are
Â«â¢â¢> made that they can be interpreted in dif
ferent ways. On some of the vital questions
that have confronted the American 'people in
the last deqade our opponents take the posi
tion that silence Is the best possible way to
convey their views. They contend that Â¦ their
lukewarm attitude of partial acquiescence in
what others have . accomplished entitles them
to be made the custodians of the financial
henor and commercial interests . which v they
have but recently sought to . ruin. I Being un
able to agree among themselves as to whether
the gold standard is a curse or a blessing, and
as to whether we ought or ought: not to have
freÂ« and unlimited coinage of silver, they have
apparently thought it expedient to avoid any
committal on these subjects and individually
each to follow his particular bent. Their
nearest approach to a majority Judgment
Keems to be that It is Â¦ now Inexpedient to
assert i their Â¦ convictions one way or the I other
and that the establishment of the gold stand
ard by. the Republican Â¦ party should not be
disturbed unless. there is an alteration in the
relative quantity of production of silver and
gold. . â¢ -' .
This order was made In the performance
of a duty Imposed upon the President by an
act of Congress, which requlresvthe executive
to make regulations to govern the subordinates
of the Pension Office in. determining who. are
entitled to pensions. President Cleveland, had
already exercised this power by a regulation
which declared that "seventy-five should be
set as the age at which total disability should
be conclusively presumed. Similarly President
McKInley established sixty-five as the age at
which half disability should be conclusively
presumed. The regulation now In question, in
the exercise of the same power, supplemented
theEe regulations made under Presidents Cleve
land and McKInley.
The men who fought for union and tor
liberty in the years from 1881 to 1S65 not only
saved this nation from ruin, r but rendered an
inestimable service to all mankind. We of the
United States owe the fact that ; to-day -we
have a country to what they did; and the na
tion has decreed by law that no one of them.'
If disabled from earning his own living, â¢shall
lack the pension' to which he' Is entitled, â¢ not
Â«nnly as a matter of gratitude, but as a matter
of Justice. It Is the. policy of the .Republican'
party, steadily continued through many ! years,
to treat the veterans of the Civil War .In a
spirit of broad liberality. - The order in ques
tion carried out this policy . and is justified
not merely ! on legal grounds,- but also- on
grounds of public morality. â¢ It is & matter of
common knowledge that when the- average
man who depends for his wages : upon bodily
labor has reached the age . of sixty- two his
earning ability Is in all probability less by
half than It was when he was In his prime;
and that by the time he has reached the age
of (seventy he has probably lost all earning
ability. If there Is doubt upon this point let
the doubter examine the employes doing man
ual labor In any great manufactory or on any
great railroad and find out how large Is the
proportion of men between the ages of sixty
two and seventy and whether these men are
still employed at the highly "paid tasks which
tbey did in their prime. As a matter of fact.
many railroads pension their employes when
they have reached these ages, and In nations
where old age pensions prevail they always
tx-cln somewhere between the two limits thus
set. It is easy to test our opponents' sincerity
in this matter. -The order in question is re
vocable at the pleasure of the executive. If
our opponents come into power they can re
voke this order and announce that they will
tieat the veterans of sixty-two to seventy as
presumably in full bodily vigor and not en
titled to pensions. Will they now authorita
tively state that they intend to do this? If
so, we accept the issue. If not, then we have
the right to ask why they raise an issue
which, when raised, they do not venture to
meet. ' Â¦ - â¢
BROAD LIBERALITY
FOR THE MEN WHO
FOUGHT FOR UNION
t Our opponents have now declared themselves
In favor of the civil service law, the repeal of
which they demanded In 1900 and In 1806. If
consistent, ! they should have gone one step
further and' congratulated the country .upon
the way in which . the civil service law is
now administered and the way In which, the
classified service has been extended. The ex
ceptions from examinations are fewer by far
than ever before and are confined to Individual
cases, where the application of the rnles would
be impracticable, unwise, unjust or unneces
sary.
Under such circumstances, .the ..demand of

It la a striking evidence of our opponents'
Insincerity in this matter that with their de

our small military establishment. Yet they
must know that the heed paid to our protests
against Ill-treatment of- our citizens will be.
exactly proportionate to the belief In our abil-_

need arise. Â¦ â¢ . â¢ " ' . '-
This" Government Is based upon' the funda

is entitled to be treated on his worth as a man,
and .'neither favored nor discriminated, against
because of any accident'in his position, p Even

pertain American citizens of â¢ foreign birth, or
of particular" .creed, who -desire to ' travel

This government has consistently demanded
equal protection â¢ abroad for 'all 'American citi
zens, whether 'â native Â¦ or naturalized. ' On
March 2T, 1899, Secretary Hey sent a letter
of instructions to all- the diplomatic and con
sular officers of .the .United States, ' in which
he said:- "This department does not discrimi
nate between native-born and naturalised citi
zens Â¦ In 1 according' them Â¦ protection while I they
are abroad, equality of treatment being re
quired by the laws of the. United States."
These orders ; to our agents abroad have been
repeated again and again,' and are treated as
the fundamental rule of Â¦ conduct laid down
for them,' proceeding upon the theory "that
all naturalized citizens of the United States
while In foreign countries are entitled to and
shall .'receive from thlB government the same,
protection: of v persons and property : which '< is
accorded to native-born citizens."- In Issuing,

passport, so far. as.lt has -power It insists that

The attempt was entirely successful.' The
tariff law -of that -year was among the causes

of making such a sweeping change in the
tariff as to paralyze the industries of the
country. S The Â¦ trusts - would cease to prosper,
but their 'smaller competitors would be ruined,
and the wage-workers would starve, while It
would not. pay ; the farmer to haul his produce
to market. The evils connected with the trusts
can be reached 'only by rational effort, step by
step. - along the lines taken by Congress and
the Executive during the past three years If
a tariff law is passed under which; the country
prospers, as the country has ' prospered under
the present tariff' law. then all classes will
share Â¦ In . the prosperity. If a.'tarlff law Is
passed .aimed at preventing the prosperity of
some of our people, it Is as certain as any
thing can be 'that this aim will be achieved
only by cutting down the prosperity of all of
our people. < .' â¢-. .
solution of the trust problem such a chaaÂ«Â«
would therefore merely mean that the trust
was" relieved of the competition of Its weaker
American competitors, and thrown only Into
competition with foreign competitors, and that
the first ' effort ' to meet - this new competition
would-' be made by cutting down wages,
and would therefore be primarily at the cost
of labor. In the case, of some of our greatest
trusts euch a change might confer upon them
a positive benefit. 'Speaking broadly it Is
evident - that the changes in the- tariff will
affect the trusts for weal .or for woe. simply
as they affect the. whole country. ' The tariff
affects trusts only as- It- affects- all other in
terests. It makes all these interests, large or
small. Â¦ profitable, and Its benefla can be 'taken
from the large only under penalty of taking
them, from the small also."
Undoubtedly, the multiplication of trusts
and ' their increase in power has been largely
due to the "failure of officials charged with
the duty of enforcing the law to -take the
necessary procedure." â¢ Such stricture . upon
the . failure of the officials of the National
Government to â¢ do their duty In this matter
is certainly not wholly undeserved as far as
the administration preceding President Mc-
Kinlcy's Is concerned; but It has no.applica
tion at . all to Republican administration. It
Is also ' undoubtedly true that what . Is most
needed Is "officials having both the disposi
tion and the courage to enforce existing law."
This ' is precisely the need that has ' been met
by the consistent and steadily continued action
of the Department of Justice under the pres
ent administration.
â¢ We, on the contrary, believe In the . gold
standard as ftxed by the usage and verdict
of the business' world, and in a sound 'mone
tary system as matters of principle; as mat
ters not of monetary, political expediency, but
of permanent organic policy. In'lS96 and again
In 1900 far-fiighted â¢ men, without regard to
their party fealty In the past. Joined to work
against what they regarded as a debased mon
etary system. The policies which they .cham
pioned have been steadfastly adhered to by
the administration; and by the act of March
14. 1900, Congress established ; the single gold
standard as the . measure ' of our monetary
value. This act received the support of every
Republican In the House, and. of .every Repub
lican except one in the Senate. Of our oppo
nents, eleven supported it In the House and
two In ' the Senate; and one hundred and
fifty opposed it in the House and twenty-eight
in the Senate. ! The record of i the last seven
years proves 'that the party/ now in power
can be trusted to take the additional action
necessary to improve and strengthen'our'mon
etary system, and that -our opponents cannot
be so trusted. The fundamental ' fact is that
In a popular government such as ours no
policy is irrevocably settled by . law unless
the people" keep in control of the Government
men Who believe In that policy as a matter of
deep-rooted conviction.' Laws can always, be
revoked; it is the spirit and the purpose of.
those responsible for their enactment and ad
ministration which must be .fixed and un
changeable! It is idle to say that the mone
tary standard of the nation is Irrevocably fixed
so long as the party which at the last elec
tion cast approximately forty-six per cent of
the total vote, refuses to put- In its platform
any statement that the question is settled, A
determination to remain silent cannot be ac
cepted as equivalent to. a recantation. Until
our opponents as a party explicitly adopts tthe
views which we -hold- and upon: which' we
have acted and are acting,, in the. matter of a
sound currency,, the only real. way-. to keep
the question from becoming : unsettled la. ~ to
keep the' Republican" party In power.
As for what our . opponents say In refer
ence to -capital and- labor, individual or cor
porate, here again all we, need by way of
answer .Is to point to what we have- actually
done â¢ and to say that â¢ If 1 continued In power
w e shall continue to carry out the policy wÂ«
' have been pursuing, and to execute the . laws
as resolutely and -fearlessly In the future as
we have executed them in the past. In my
speech of acceptance 'I said: â¢''.' ''-.:. â¢ . . :-â¢'â¢- â¢
â¢- "We 'recognize the organisation i of- capital
and- the organization of labor as natural vut
comes> of our. Industrial system. Kach.klnd
-of organisation. Is.- ttf'.be' favored: so. long as
.it acts in a spirit of Justice and of regard
for the rights of others. Each la to be granted
the. full protection- of the law," and ; each â¢ in
turn is to be held to a strict obedience to the
law; ' for' no , man I> above - It and no man
below it: The humblest Individual Is. to have
his rights safeguarded aa scrupulously as
those of the strongest organization, . for ! each
is to receive Justice, no more and no less. ,ThÂ«t
problems with which we have to deal in our
modern industrial Â¦ and social life are mani
fold; but the spirit in which it is necessary
to approach their solution is simply the spirit
of 'honesty, of courage and of common-sense."
The action of the Attorney General in .en
forcing the. anti-trust and Interstate commerce
laws, and -the action of the. last Congress in
enlarging the scope of the Interstate -. com
merce law,- and In creating the Department of.
Commerce and -Labor, with a Bureau of Cor
porations, have for the first time opened a
"chance for the National Government to deal
Intelligently and .adequately with the ques
tions affecting society, whether for gool
or for evil, because of . the accumulation' of
capital in great corporations, and because of
the new relations caused thereby. These laws
are now being . administered with entire effi
ciency; and as, in their working, need Is
shown for amendment or addition to them â
whether better to secure the proper publicity,
or better to guarantee the rights of shippers,
or in any other direction â this need will be
met. It Js now asserted "that the commqn
law, as developed, affords a complete legal
remedy against monopolies." But there is no
common law . of the United States. Its
rules 'can be enforced only by the State courts
and officers. No Federal court or officer could
take any action whatever under them. It
was this - fact, -coupled with the Inability of
the States to control trusts and monopolies,
which led to the passage of the Federal stat
utes known as the Sherman anti-trust act and
the interstate commerce act; and It Is only
through the exercise of the powers conferred
by these acts, and by the statutes of the last
Congress supplementing them, that the Na
tional Government acquires any Jurisdiction
over the subject. ,To say that action against
trusts, and monopolies should ' be limited to
the application ot. the common. law is equiva
lent to saying that the National Government
should take no action whatever -. to regulate
them. . . - â¢ ' â¢ / .
But it is difficult to respect an attitude ' of
mind such as has been fairly described above,
and where there is. no respect there can be no
trust. A policy with so , slender a basis of
principle -would not stand- the strain of a
single ' year of business adversity.
Opposition's Lack of Â¦'{ Policy on the Question of National
Finance Is Held Up to Ridiculed
Beyond question this prosperity could not
have convj if the .American people had not
pocsessed thej necessary thrift, energy and
business intelligence to turn their vast material
resources to account. ' But It is no less true
that it is our economic policy as regards the
tariff and finance which has enabled us' as a
nation to make such good use of the Individ
ual capacities of our citizens, and the natural
resources of our country. Every class of our
people Is benefited by the protective tariff.
During the last few years the merchant has
seen the export trade of this country grow
faster than ever in our previous history. The
manufacturer * could not keep his factory run
ning |f : tt were not for the protective tariff.
The wage worker would . do well to . remember
that if protection Is "robbery," and - is to be
punisrfed accordingly, he will be the first to
pay the penalty: for either he will be turned
.adrift entirely, or his wages will be cut down
to the starvailon point. As Conclusively shown
by the bulletins of the Bureau of Labor, the
purchasing power of the average, wage re
ceived by the wageworker has grown faster
than the cost of living, and this tn spite of
the continual shortening of working hours.
The accumulated savings of tha workingmen
of the country, as shown by the deposits in
the savings banks,' have increased by leaps
and' bounds. At no time In the history of this
or any other country has there been an era.
ao productive of material benefit alike to
worklngman and . employer aa ' during the
seven years that have just passed. ".:.-Â¦
The farmer has benefited quite as much as
the manufacturer, the merchant and. the wage
worker. The most welcome and Impressive
fact established by the last . census Is the
wide and even distribution of wealth among
all classes of our countrymen. The â¢ chief
agencies . In producing - this distribution . are
rtiown ' by the censua to be the development
of manufactures and the application - of new
Inventions to universal use. The result has
been an .- increasing Interdependence - of agri
culture and manufactures. Agriculture is now,
as it always has been, the basis of civiliza
tion. The G.000,000 farms of the United States,
operated by men who, as a clasa, are steadfast,
single - minded, . and industrious, . form the
basis of all the other achievements of the
American people and are more fruitful than
all their other resources. The men on those
8,000,000 farms ' receive from the protective
tariff what they most - need, and that is the
best of all possible markets. All other classes
depend" uoon the farmer, but the farmer in
turn depends upon the market they furnish
him for his produce. The annual output of our
agricultural products is nearly four billions of
dollars. Their Increase In value ' has been
prodigious, although agriculture , has lan
guished In moat other countries; and the main
factor in' this Increase is the corresponding
Increase- of our manufacturing Industries.
American farmers have prospered, because the
growth of their market has kept pace with
the growth of the farms. The additional mar
ket continually furnished for agricultural
products by domestic manufacturers has been
far in excess of the' outlet to other lands. -An
export trade in farm products -is necessary, to
dispose of our surplus; and the export trade
of our farmers, both In animal products and
In plant products, has very largely Increased.
"Without the enlarged home market to keep
this surplus down, we should have to. reduce
production** or else feed the world at less
than tiie cost of production.' In the forty years
ending in 1900 the total value of farm prop
erty increased twelve and a half . billions of,
dollars; the farmer gaining even more during
this - period than the manufacturer.' Lorn; ago
overproduction (would have checked the mar
velous development of oar national agriculture
but for (be steadily Increasing * demand of
American manufacturers for- farm' products re
quired as. raw' materials for steadily expand
ing Industries. The farmer has become depend
ent upon the manufacturer ' to "* utilize that
portion of his .produce -which does not go di
rectly to food supply. - In- 1900 62 per cent,- or
a little over half, of the total valne of the
farm ! products of I they nation - was consumed
in manufacturing industries as the raw ma
terials of the factories. Evidently . the . manu
facturer la the farmer's best and most direct
customer. ' Moreover, the American manufac
turer purchases his farm supplies - almost ex
clusively In his own country. Nine-tenths of
all the raw materials of every kind and de
scription consumed Â¦ In 9 American manufac
tories are of American production. .The manu
facturing establishments tend steadily to mi
grate into the heart of the great agricultural
districts. The center of the manufacturing in
dustry In 1900 was : near the middle of Ohio,
and It- Is moving westward at the rate of
about thirty miles- in . every decade; and this
movement is Invariably accompanied by a
marked increase In the value of the farm
lands. Local causes, .; notably the competition
between new farm lands and old farm lands,
tend here and there to obscure what Is hap
pening; but It is Â¦ as certain as the operation
of any economic law that In the country as
a whale, farm values will continue to Increase
an the partnership between manufacturer and
farmer grows more intimate through further
advance of industrial science. The' American
manufacturer never could have placed this
nation I at the head of the manufacturing na
tions of the world if he had not had behind
him, . securing htm every variety of raw ma
terial, the exhaustless resources of the Ameri
can tarm. developed by the akin and the en
terprise of intelligent and educated American
farmers. On the other hand, the debt of the
fanners to the manufacturers Is equally heavy,
and the ' future of American - agriculture Is
bound up In the future of -American manu- !
factures. The two Industries have become,
under the economic policy of our Government,
so closely Interwoven, so mutually Interde
pendent, that neither can hope to maintain
Itielt -.t the high-water mark of progress with
out the ether. Whatever makes to the ad
vantage of one IÂ» equally to the advantage of
the other.

A party whose members are radically at

at all are ocry united on issues where their

othtr words, our ' governmental efficiency

anticipated, but to doing each unanticipated
U>sk a* it aruae.
Wh'n the contert of 1836 was decided the
â¢iuwtion Â¦*Â¦ f the war Â«ith Spain was not an
Issue. When the contest of ltfOO was decided
the shape which .the Isthmian canal question
ultimately took cculd not have been foreseen.
Ilut the same qualities which enabled those
rr-rpcnsible tor making and administering the
laws at Washington to deal successfully with
tjÂ»e taria and the currency enabled them also
tn Â¦:â¢ Â¦: with the Spanish war; and the name !
qualities which enabled them to act wisely
in the Philippines and in Cuba also enabled
tbcm to do their duty as regards the prob- :
l<-ms ' connected with the trusts and to secure
the bulldtne of the Isthmian canal. . We are 1
cement to rrct our case before the American
;â¢;:-. on the fact that to adherence to a
lofty id*al we h&v* added proved govern
mental efficiency. Therefore our promises may
surely be trusted as regards any Issue, that is
now before the people: and we may equally
be trusted to deal with any problem which
tr.ay hereafter arise.
Po wtll has the work been done i that our
exponents do not venture to recite the facts
aixwt our policies or acts and then oppose
them. They attack them only when they
have first misrepresented them; for 'a truth
ful recital .would leave no room for adverse
comment. .
I'anama offers an Instance In point. Our
opponents can criticize what we did in Panama
only on condition of misstating what was
dene. The administration behaved throughout
not only with good faith, but with extraordi
nary patience and large generosity toward
those with whom it deaJt. It was also mind
ful of American Interests. It acted in r.triet
Â«*emp!lance with the law passed by Congress.
I!.-'i not Panama been promptly recognized
and the transit across the Isthmus kept open.
In accordance with our treaty rights and ob
ligation*, there would have ensued endless guer
rilla warfare and possibly foreign complica
tions; while all chance of building the canal
vrould have been deferred, certainly for years,
perhaps for a generation or more. Criticism
of the action In this matter is simply criti
cism of the only possible action which could
have secured the building of the canal; as
well as the peace and quiet which we were,
by treaty, bound to preserve along the line
of transit across the isthmus. The service ren
dered this country In securing the perpetual
rirht to construct, maintain, operate and de
fend Che' canal was so great that our oppo
nents do not venture to raise the Issue In
straightforward fashion: for If so raised there
â¢would be no Issue. The decisive action which
brought about this beneficent result was the
Â«xerdsa by the -President of the powers vested
tn Mm, and In him alone, by the constitution;
the power to recognize foreign Governments by
enterlnr Into diplomatic relations with them
anfl -the rower to make treaties which, when
ratlSed toy the Senate, become under the con
stitution part ef the supreme law of the land.

tiiip of war off Colon when the revolution
Lroke out in Fanama, and when only the

a higher gtancard than ever before in marks
manship and in seamanship, as Individual
units and as component part* of squadrons
and fleet* ? If they object to any or all of
there things, ive join issue with .them.. Our
foreign policy has been not only 'highly ad
vantageous to the United states, but hardly
less advantageous to the world as a - whole.
Peace and good will Jiave followed In its
footcteps." The Government has shown its-lf
no less anxiciis to respect the rights of others
than lnslrtent that the rights of Americans
be respected In return. As for the navy, it
has been and Is now the most potent guar
antee of peace; and it is such chiefly because
tt is formidable, and ready for use.
When our opponents epeak of "encroach
ments" by the executive upon the" authority
of Congress or the Judiciary, apparently the
act they ordinarily have In view la Pension'
Order No. 7S. Issued under the authority of
existing law. This order directed that here
after any veteran of the Civil War. who Mkd
reached the age of â¬2 should be presumptively
entitled' to the pension of $6 a month, given
under the dependent pension law to those whose
capacity to earn their livelihood by manual
labor had been decreased 50 per cent, and that
by the time the age of 70 was reached the
presumption should be that the physical dis
ability war complete, the age being treated,
as an evidential fact In each case.
Our opponents contend that the government
is now administered ' extravagantly, and â¢"?Â»*Â¦
whereas there was "a surplus of $S0,0C0.90O
in 1900"' there is '-a deficit of more than
VIO.OOO.OCO". In the year that has Just closed.
Thi* deficit is imaginary, and is' obtained by
including in the Ordinary current expenses. thÂ«
sum of 55O.00O.0CO; which ras paid for the
right-of-way, of the Panama Cana* out of the
accumulate. Surplus Jn the treasury. Compar
ing the current or ordinary expenditures for
the two years, there was a surplus of nearly
$SO.0C0.0OO" for the year 1900, and of only a
little more than *s. 000,000 for the year that
has Just closed. But .this diminution of tne
annual surplus was brought about deslgnediy
by the abolition of the war taxes in the la
terval- between the two dates. The acts ,, of
March 2Â» 1901, and April 12. 1303, cut down
the Internal revenue taxes to an amount es
timated at $105,CCO,000 a year. In other
words, the reduction of taxation, has been con*
siderably' greater -than the reduction- la tne
annual surplus. Since the close of the war
with Spain there has been ho .substantial
change in the rate of annual expenditures, as
compared with the fiscal year ending Â»n June.
1001. for example, the fiscal year that has. Just
closed showed a relatively small Increase in
expenditure (excluding the canal payment al
ready referred to), while the year previous
shewed a relatively small decrease. - â¢-â¢""*
The. expenditures of the nation have been
macazed In a spirit of economy as far re
moved from waste as from niggardliness; and
In the future every effort will be continued to
secure an economy, as â¢ strict as -is consistent
with efficiency. Once more our opponents have
promised what they cannot or should not per
form. The prime reason -why the expenses
of the Government have increased of recent*
years Is to be found in the fact that the peo
ple, after mature thought, have deemea it
wise to have certain new forms of work Tor
the public undertaken by the public. This
.necessitates such expenditures, for instance, as
these for rural free delivery. Â«r for thÂ« In
spection of meats uitdor-the Department ot
Agriculture, or for irrigation. But these new
expenditues are neces?ary: nn one wuni se

effect. If this Is the case, if, in other words,
they are Insincere in the promise they make,
it is . only necessary to say again that it Is
unwise to' trust' men -who are false In;. one
thing to deal with anything. The mere con
sciousness cf broken faith would hamper them
iu' continuing our policy In the Islands, and
only by continuing unchanged this policy can
the honor of the country be maintained, | or
the Interests of the islands subserved. I:, on
the other hand, our opponents came into power
and attempted to.carry out their promises to
tne tuipinoK by giving them Independence and
withdrawing American control from the Is
lands, the result would be a frightful calamity
to the Filipino* themselves and In Its larger
ai-itct would amount to an international crime.
Anarchy would follow, and the most violent
ai. archie forces would, be directed partly
against the civil . government,, partly against
all forms of Â¦ religious and educational civiliz

such course of action â such a ' "policy ' of

would, 'be . found, well nigh . insuperable.- -j If â¢ It
is morally. Indefensible. to hold the archipelago

PRESIDENT'S STIRRING MESSAGE TO VOTERS
Captain Hunker of- the New York
said last night that it was more than
probable that the poor condition of the
Lena's machinery was due -to inexpe
rienced engineers, or possibly to. the
consuming of a low grade of coal.
As Admiral Chadv.lck was absent
from the New York it was impossible
to ascertain his views on the subject.
Lieutenant Sargent said that the on'y
question put to him by the Russians in
regard to news of the war was wheth
er Port Arthur had fallen. He says
that when he told them the Russian
stronghold was still in the possession
of the Slavs the Russian officers seemed
surprised.' They asked no questions. in
regard to the doings of the army, and
seemed, to care little about-what was
going on. The officers of the New York
thought this action on the part of the
Russians singular, inasmuch as. they
had been at sea for over a month with
out news.
Captain Hunker, says that from what
he has learned of the condition of the
Lena she will have to be dismantled,
as required by international law, after
she has been here twenty-four hours.
Once dismantled she will be compelled
to stay, here until the war is over. Her
crew will enjoy the -San Franfcisco cli
mate for some time unless they go back
to Russia by way of Xew York. ...
The Lena is.very.fotM of bottom and
her engines and boilers are nearly out
of commission. She does not present
the . spicU and span appearance of .the
American man-of-war; and her officers
and men are. poorly uniformed. The
sailors are scantily, attired and. their
clothes are old and. torn. - . .
Shortly after the Lena came to an an
chorage Captain Berlinsky 'and his of
ficers visited the United States flagship
New York and were received by Flag
Lieutenant Sargent, as both Admiral
Chadwick and Captain Hunker were on
6hore>
He Is Gracefully Received Aboard the
Flagship New York.
LENA'S CAPTAIN VISITS.
"I was greatly surprised when, at 4
o'clock tais afternoon. I received a tele
phone message from the Merchants'
ESxdiaage stating that the Russian
traneport Lena had ccme into port. I
had no idea that she was in this part
of thf world and I cannot imagine what
*ht is doing here. Perhaps she came
across to harass the merchant marine.
Her appearance here is an absolute
mystery- to me. 1 understand * put
into this port to have her boilers and
engines repaired. I am awaiting with
Exeat interest to hear what the author
ities in Washington will do in the
premises."
At both the offics and the residence
of Paul Kosakevitch. the Russian Con
sul, it v,as stated that the Consul was
away and would not be in again until
10 o'clock Monday morning.
Kisaburo Uycno, the Japanese Con
sul, said:
KUaliuro Uycno Can Offer No Ex
planation for Lena's Appearance.
CONSUL IS SURPRISED.
Admiral William H. Whiting, com
mandant at Yerba Buena Island,, said:
"The arrival of the Russian trans
port Lena was wired at once : to the
authorities at Washington. No action
can be taken until a reply comes from
there. I do not know what action the
department will take, but I doubt very
much whether the Lena will be al
lowed to remain in this port for any
extensive repairs."
WASHINGTON' MUST ADVISE.

ST. PETERSBURG, Sept. 11.â The
Official Messenger' to-day published
the following resolution, . which was
adopted by the Holy Synod: v
By virtua of an imperial ukase to thÂ» effect
that during the present trials of our dear
country more ardent prayers should be offered
for the victory of the BusMan troops, who are
worshipers of Christ, over a cruel . enemy, full
of guile, the Holy Synod pronounces the time
ripe for special prayers to be offered In all of
the churches in the Empire on Sundays and
holy days after mass, beseeching that heavenly
aid Should be sent to tho Russian army, which
is satrtfichig Us life for Its faith. Its Em
peror and Its country, for long life for the vic
torious troops and for the repose of the souls
of the warriors . who falL ,
tempted to blow, up a wall behind which
the Russians waited. The Japanese sol
dier calmly left Redoubt One. carrying
two boxes and deliberately marched to
ward . the Russians,, who suffered him
to, approach. When he was quite near
sharpshooters â¢ killed him. On investi
gation 'Â¦. it '.was found; that the boxes he
carried contained lyddite, -with fuses
carefully affixed.
SAN RAFAEL, Sept. 11.â The forest
fire which has been burning on the
Bolinas ridge for the past four days
is still raging, notwithstanding the- re
ports that the fire is under control.
Sheriff Taylor returned from the
scene of the tire thia afternoon and
reported it under control, but he bad
not been. here but a few minutes when
word was received from Liberty Farm
that the fire had broken out again at
Little Carson Canyon between Liber
ty Farm and Lagunitas.
Sheriff Taylor Immediately gathered
twenty men and .returned to the burn
ed district, although he nas taken no
rtst for twenty-four hours. The fire
Is practically under control on the
Camp Taylor side of the ridge and un
less the wind rises the blaze will be
entirely extinguished by morning.
Pedrini Brothers, lumber merchants,
whose camp is In the John Enos Val
ley, managed Â¦ to save many corda of
cut wood, but the flames devoured two
hundred cords of tan bark and as many
cords of cut. wood. The fire Is now
burning through Little Carson Can
yon toward Lilly Lake and Milliards*
ranch.
Milliards has every available man oa
his ranch at work and a desperate at
tempt will be made to save it from tha
flames. Many thousand acres of Umber
have been destroyed since tha- fir*
started, the Howard and Shafter tract
alone constituting twelve thousand:
acres, all of which was burned, Â¦
Many ranches and cattle have been
destroyed by the blaze and people re
siding pear the burned district Â¦ havÂ«
shipped their valuables to a place of
safety. No word has been received fro*m
Boll nas. Inverness, Olema. or Point
Reyes - for four days, as . all telephone
and telegraph wires are dawn, owing
to the fire. T
Special Dispatch to The Call.
| WASHINGTON, Sept. 11.â Secretary
Morton said to-night no word had been
.received from Admiral Whiting re
garding the Lena, but that he asked
for instructions his telegram would be
referred to the State Department. It
is thought here that the Lena would be
given a reasonable, time to make re
pairs, especially as she is not a fight
ing vessel and is far removed from the
theater of war. With no- Japanese
ships in close pursuit Navy Department
officials are puzzled to. know how. the
Lena came to put in at San Francisco,
as the Bureau of \N aval Intelligence,
which is watching, closely the move
ments of ships of .various nations, had
not received information. that she was
expected in American waters.

TOKIO. S^pt. 11.â An approximation
of tlie Japanese casualties in the battle
of Liaoyang, based upon reports of the
chiefs of the medical corps of the three
Japanese armies, was concluded to-day.
It or.vers the fighting from August 26.

In the right army, under the com
mand of General Kuroki. 4860 men.
In the center army, under the com
mand of General Nodzu. 4992 men.
In the left army, under the command
of General Oku. 7681 men.
These casualties include 1S6 officers

Liaoyang.
LONDON. Sept. 11.â The correspond

army reiterates his statement that
< Â»ku : s losses in two days' fighting at
Liaoyang were close to 20.000 men,
v.hih- in the entire battle they far ex
credtd that figure. He says that the
losses of the center and right armies
were not as great in proportion, Oku's
rasualties being: the greatest because of
his repeated terrific assaults upon the
Russian fortifications. The correspond

The twenty-four hours* stay in a neu
tral port will expire about noon to-day
and the question of her remaining here
will be a matter for the American and
the Russian Governments to settle,
with Japan doubtless having consider
able to say on the subject. It seems
to be the general opinion that the Lena
must dismantle herself and remain in
this port till the close of the war or
leave the harbor.
'Collector Stratton, asked as- to what
the department would do in the mat
ter, was less. communicative than the
Russian officers, who'acknowledge that
possibly to remain here the Lena may
have to dismantle. The Collector says:
This ii> a matter of great delicacy Involving
diplomatic considerations, and I am therefore
not in a position at this time to discuss it.
Until the arrival cf the steamer has been re
ported to nie officially I cannct say what ac
tion I shall take in the premises. It Is more
than probable that both the Japanese and the
Rus*!an Consuls will call on me to-morrow tn
relation to the action I shall take concerning
thÂ«s transport's stay in San Francisco. It
would be highly indelicate for me to say In
advance of official advices what the action will
be or what law can be applied to the vessel
and her movements.

came from Odessa on the Black Sea. I

Islands. The usual trip " consumes
about twenty-six days, j y
Her way from the Siberian port was

the ship to the effect that the Russian
crossed tfle ocean for the purpose
of placing herself in. the track of the
America Maru. but the failure of her
boilers drove the raider into harbor.

The Russian Consul's .apparent
eagerness yesterday after the captain
of the Lena had visited him, to.dis
cover the whereabouts of Captain Hav
rer, naturally aroused- the suspicion
that possibly the former pilot of .the
Vladivostok fleet is in some way. con
nected with the sudden- appearance in
this port of one of the Czar's trans
ports'and that the latter vessel may
have been the one Captain Havner had
in mind when he told his friend, that
he expected a Russian vessel'here and
was hopeful of returning to Vladivos

empire for a number of years.
If was generally understood. by Cap
tain Havner's fellow passengers during
the voyage across the Pacific that he
was on a mission to this country and
his quiet movements during his stay
in this city strengthened the existing
suspicion that he was here in the in
terest of the Russian Government.
When it first became known that the
Japanese Government was receiving
large cargoes of contraband articles
from San Francisco by the Pacific Mail
and Toyo Kisen-Kaisha liners the cap
tain remarked, in a rather, significant
way, that Russia would soon -be ship
ping to Vladivostok.
Later he grew confidential with one
acquaintance, to whom he said that
he was awaiting a Russian -vessel to
arrive at .his port, and added that he
expected to return to Vladivostok be
fore .many months had passed.
During his stay in this city he made
frequent trips into the wholesale dis
tricts, where it was supposed- that he
talked with merchants regarding ; the
purchase of large 'â¢ stocks Â¦ of their
goods. He finally left here, saying that
he was. going to a northern resort for
a short rest. â¢
The Morning Post's correspondent in
the field with General Kuroki describes
the operations against 'Liaoyang as
twelve days : of the; hardest possible
fighting and marching on short rations,
with a. temperature of 100 decrees In
the shade and frequent falls of rain.
All of this, he. says, has been ', borne
splendidly, Â» though- the men-were worn
out after the tense struggle. He
adds:
-"General Kuropatkin's retreat was
masterly. He held the northeastern
heights to the last ' possible moment
and secured ' a safe retirement for \ his
army and his guns."
LONDON, ; Sept. 12.â The situation at
Port i Arthur, especially -in view of the
sailing from . Kronstadt on Sunday of
the Baltic fleet, - receives new attention
in the newspapers. ' Spencer Wilkinson,
in the Morning Post, says it depends
entirely . upon . how long Port Arthur
can hold out whether the Baltic fleet
will" be of any effect.
The Standard declares that the fleet
will never get beyond Suez, but says if,
by any inconceivable chance, it . should
reach Chinese . : waters, it would . only
give Togo fresh opportunities for add
ing: to his'- category of successes. The
Standard adds: i_ Â¦
, "We "cannot credit the ' Gov
ernment : with any Intention of sending
its ; last , maritime reserve, to destruc
tion." â¢ Â« .
:. The Telegraph devotes a lengthy edi
torial : to \ a witty protest against the
Japanese'treatment of war. correspond
ents' and â¢ attaches, - based on Bennett
Burleigh's strictures.' The editorial de
clares that "Great Britain's ally," solely
from the point of view of 'her own in
terests, committed a profound "political
error in allowing correspondents Â¦ to go
to the. front and then reducing their
presence to a nullity."
i .The paper.', also warns Japan : that
Western ' , sympathy is not ; encouraged
by -the "superfluous evidences of Jap
anese distrust." -'.
"The Muscovites presented a most
dejected appearance in the retreat,"
continues Burleigh. '.'The men are of
good material, but the officers lack
many necessary qualities. The war is
most unpopular with all the Russian
soldiers. In Japan' it is just the reverse.
"The dread Cossack, cavalry is a
myth which the Japanese infantry de
spise. The Russians made absolutely
no use of their masses of horsemen.
"I fear the losses to both the Rus
sians and the Japanese are near 30,000
men each."
Bennett Burleigh sends to the Dally
Telegraph from the Japanese head
quarters a long description of the
fighting. He says:
"General -Kuroki, who was hotly at
tacked by Kuropatkln and was for a
time In Jeopardy, was unable to get
astride of the railway, otherwise Liao
yane would have been a Sedan for the
Russians.
"What surprised me more than any
thing else was the wonderful manner
in which the Japanese continued for a
whole week their awful . bombardment
of the -Russian positions. It was the
fiercest artillery attack, perhaps, in
history. Tens of thousands of . shells
were thrown daily., but the supplies of
them seemed Inexhaustible. The Rus
sians only replied spasmodically, but
their rifle fire was often the heaviesjt.
"It must be said for the Japanese
that, although they fight with the ut
most fierceness, daring and courage,
they battle not like mad men, but with
their heads, and they obey their of
ficers in all straits."
Burleigh testifies, as other corre
spondents have done, that the Japan
ese are continually drafting fresh men
in the fighting ranks and remarks
how marvelously they took fortifica
tions whose capture appeared to be im
possible. He asserts that it was
Kuroki's dangerous position that com
pelled the* other Japanese armies to
force the fighting.

the buiidlns. â¢ - - â¢- â¢ â¢ Â¦ . â¢ -,
The foundation of the spiritual church Is
composed ol three esfcentlals-^the Word of God,
Jesus Christ and Urothrrhcod. The Bible, the
Word of Gcd Is the one and only book for
Christians. ?* Many Â¦-â¢books have: b*en â¢ wflttf-n
about it and ma a.v more< w!4l be. written, but
thÂ»>. Elb'.t like Mount -Shasta, -which points
ever to ' heaven, â¢neve'r' changes. â¢ Our fore
fathers umeraily referred to It as the Word of
God, btcauwj they firmly believed In It. That
designation is tun so . comnymly . used nowa
days, and e^me, I am sorry to say, do not re
gard it ?Â¦ authoritative. It is a r'ty that such
a rreat mind as that of the late i Herbert.- Spen
cer nÂ»ver appreciated â¢Â¦ the -Word of God, but
exit-ted in a. state bordering on. Infidelity. If a
mari thinks of nothing, but machinery arid ma
terial belnss he . will -become, somewhat Â¦ me
chanical and materialistic But we miKht aiÂ«
w*ll. try to reason ourselves away as to.at
tempt to rpason Go<] away. The Word of God
tells us about Gc3 -am! is' *ah Important part'Of
the foundation of cur faith. â¢ ' '. Â¦
Brotherhood is another strong; element, .of
Christianity and v,-e have had a splendid eje
empllticatlun of it hereabouts during the last
ten Â«iavfi. when a' powerful fraternity met. In
conclave, in San Francisco. The .Inslenla of
that society Is the cross and the crown, em
blem* of Christianity. It Is rare that a society
gets higher than .the motives wnlch called: It
into h<t inc. Are 'we Christians for Jiy or com
fort? There is BomethinR-ln it'bVtter- still. It
is the privilege. every .ChriHtiap- has of taking
up the cress "of Chrift iinA carrying It with
him. The best brolfccrhood is that' which flnds
Its iource in iymnathy. Whei) we have such
fellowship in our s'oulw and Iri pur churththen
we have a Taith nnfl'a church that Â¦wHMIve. Â¦-.
It I* said that this year, with Bryan
and free silver out of the campaign,
the Democrats are again unanimous.
This statement, however, is contradict
ed by some of the radical among the
party. There are many Bryan Demo
crats in Maine and the name of Parker
has caused no enthusiasm among them.
It may btf fair to assume that many of
the Democrats will now take occasion
tc- retaliate upon the gold Democrats
who forsook Bryan and this year either
remain away from the polls, or else
vote the Republican ticket.
In the campaign just closed the na
tional issues have occupied a minor
place. From one end of the State to
the other there has, been discussion of
various local Issues. . If. the vote to
morrow should be entirely on national
issues It Is believed that Maine would
show a plurality of 25,000 or 30,000 for
Roosevelt. With State issues and local
contests involved it Is difficult to esti
mate what plurality William T. .Cobb.
the Republican candidate for Governor,
will get. He expects not less than 15.
000 plurality.
Representative Burlelgh said that he
believes that the plurality will be from
12,000 to 15.000. Representative Powers
places the figures at from 15,000 to 18,
000. The Republican State Committee
believes that Representative Powers'
flgures will be realized. .
George E. Hughes, the Democratic
member of the national committee, be
lieves the Republican plurality is to be
largely reduced and he would not be
surprised, he says, if the figures fell
below 5000."
AUGUSTA. Me. Sept. 11.â The Maine
State election tukes place to-morrow.
The campaign has been hard fought
by both sides and it is expected a large
total vote will be polled.
Politicians of both parties agree that
the Republican majority will not be so
large as it was in recent years. A dif
ference of opinion, however; exists as
to which electic/n should be used for
comparison with the present one. The
Republicans Insist that the only true
basis- for comparison Is the vote of 183Â£.

That the proposal to issue bonds for
the improvement and adornment of

Young Spencer had been trying to
climb on one of the cars when he
slipped and fell under . the wheels.
The boy managed to cling to a hand
rail and save his body from being
crushed, but his efforts did not avail
to save his life. The shock from the
accident and from the operation was
too severe ,and the injured youth did
not rally.
Spencer was the eldest of- seven
children. He attended a public school
and -was a newspaper carrier. His
father, a miner, is absent from home.
Mrs. Spencer is prostrated. The boy
lived at 122S Filbert street.

I found that the navy and its splendid ma

corps were concerned, quite have a. feeling of
absolute dependence upon the person of the
supreme war ; lord. . It could not. Indeed be
otherwise, â¢ In view ' of the historical military
and political development of our forces, and a-
I look at It to-day I feel mat I have suc
cessful In every respect. The officers' corps
of the navy Is my officers' corps, and Its mem
bers become my officers and my comrades. It
Is owing to thai attainment of this clcse and
Intimate connection, .which is similar to that
which for centuries part has existed between
the officers' corps of the army and Its King,
that It has become possible to entrust great
achievements to them,' for It in also true In
this case that "the letter kllleth. but the

The words your Excellency has just ad

have deeply moved me. and It Is with Joyful
assent and from the bottom of my heart that
I reply that the navy and my fighting- fleet are

to see them Imbued, and an regards the rela

. In the course of time their engage
ment was formally announced, .but' for
some reason that was never explained
it was broken off. It has been suggest
ed that the good Bishop came ' to the
conclusion that . the life of arduous
labor, he had mapped out for himself
allowed scant room ' for domestic bliss
and if called on to sacrifice one or the
other the church had the superior claim
upon him. 'As? regards Lady Ulrica,; it
has. been hinted that devout and kind
hearted though she undoubtedly is, she
discovered that she. yearned for some
thing different fronvthe life of a min
istering angel of the slums. The Bishop
is still single and likely^ to continue so.
It was in India, as the guest of Lord
and Lady Curzon, that Lady -Ulrica
met her future husband, who was then
on the viceroy's staff as: military sec
retary- The soldier : on .whom she â¢ has
bestowed the*., place in her affections
that, was once held by the Bishop, is a
good one.- Though not yet forty he saw
a deal of service in; the Soudan, taking
part In .- the fighting at Atbara . and
Khartoum ; and . winning a .brevet ma
jority and' two "mentions." Now he is
lieutenant colonel ' of that I crack â¢ regi
ment, the Tenth Hussarsâ the ""Don't
Dance Tenth." He is distinguished for
his sound sense ; and practical ability
as well as pluck.
It is said that they â¢ wore gauze
veils to escape freckles,, bathed their
faces in dew in the early morning, had
stated. hours. for exercise arid rest dur
ing the day, and that their food waa
carefully selected, weighed and meas
ured in' accordance with directions
given by an eminent physician, that
they might attain beauty of* form and
perfection, of coloring.
â¢ This sort of training alone might
have produced vain and frivolous but
terflies of fashion, but their studies
were planned with equal care. . In the
case of Lady Ulrica, who was by na
ture the most serious min/led and in
tellectual of the four, this was at
tended with the happiest results.
After a course of home education she
went to Glrton College, Cambridge,
where she remained for two years.
Later on, of her own volition, . she
took up the career of nursing and fol
lowed the example of Lady Griselda
Cheap (then Lady Griselda Ogilvy)
by qualifying in a- hospital as a fully
trained nurse. She made practical
use of the knowledge thus acquired
among, the poor of the East End.
. It was while engaged In this good
work that she met the present Bishop
of London, who, as Bishop of Stepney,
one of the most poverty-stricken bor
oughs of London, was then ardently
devoting himself to Christian and phi
lanthropic work among the slum
dwellers under his charge.

the Durbin family of the affair until the
result of their search was known.
The Governor is camping with a par

and set out for a ride. He underesti
mated the speed at which he was trav

the camp was not. In sight and no fa
miliar object was' in view..
.' He had taken no account of the di
rection Jn which his horse had traveled,
and after, wandering about for several
hours was forced to camp out alone for
the night. : . Thinking his friends would
start a search for, him and fearing that
he would get farther away from the
campi he remained a,t the place where
he had tethered ' his horse until late
next, day, but none, of his friends ap

A NECKLACE OF LOVE
DISPATCHES from Helsingfors, the capital of the Russian
Grand Duchy of Finland, state that Prince Obolensky, the
successor of the assassinated General Bobrikoff, has entered
upon his tenure of office as Governor of that turbulent district of
the Czar's realm. The advices further add the significant fact that
already the new Governor has received threats that he would not
be in Finland a week before being made the victim of an attack
similar to that which removed his predecessor from office so violently.
The. new lieutenant of Nicholas, therefore, like the successor of
Minister von Plehwe, goes into office with his eyes open to the ele
ment of personal danger which intervenes to complicate the dis
charge of his already difficult task.
â¢ The series of assassinations that have struck down officers of
the Czar's Government, first in Armenia, then in Finland and finally
at the very seat of authority in St. Petersburg itself, is grave portent
of what is to come to Russia, now staggering under the weight of
defeat in the Far East. Those terrible spirits of unrest and disorder
that arc classed under the generic term of Nihilists need only a
tremor to manifest itself in the stern outward mask of the Govern
ment to push their fanatical creed to bloody consummation. When
now they find that the hand which was wjDiit to weigh upon them'
so mightily is paralyzed by the blows of an armed enemy the repres
sion that comes with fear is dissipated, and undaunted they pursue
their tenets of murder and revolution.
It is to be observed by a study of the nihilist movement in Rus
sia that war and terrorism go hand in hand in that unhappy land.
Paul I, who held the throne during the early stages of the Napoleonic
regime, allowed the country to be dragged into a coalition against
the French and was stricken by the hand of an assassin on March
23, 1 801. Alexander I, the visionary who divided the world with
Bonaparte on the raft at Tilsit and lived to enter Paris at the
heels of the broken Emperor, narrowly escaped death at the hands
of his people so many times that near the end of his life he lived like
a hunted beast and died broken-hearted. Alexander II, of emanci
pation fame, suffered a revolution of the Poles and forced his realm
into the Turkish war of 1877-78. On March 13, 1881, a nihilist bomb
snuffed out his life.
Difficult it is for us of the republic to conceive of the animus
that fires the hearts of these reactionaries of the great despotism. In
the cases of the majority of them that blind adoration of things re
ligious, which is the characteristic of the Russian people, is wholly
displaced by an equally slavish adherence to the principles of revo
lution. Nihilism is a religion no less than the orthodox Greek
creed. Its votaries court martyrdom with a zeal as fanatical as that
of the Christians under Nero; they preach death as no ante-Nicene
father preached life immortal. Now that war has again brought the
terror to Russia, who is .to prophesy what the events that are to
befall and what the ending? N

BY F. P. DUNNE.
MR. DOOLEY
HAS HIS SAY ABOUT
THE LABOUR TROUBLES
np HE country seems to have turned a corner in trade conditions
I and the depression of the past several months has been suc
1 ceeded by more activity and cheerfulness, especially in the East.
The bank clearings are making a better showing, railway earnings
are increasing, labor troubles arc being settled, crop prospects have
ceased to diminish, retail and jobbing trade in many sections is bet
ter, wholesale distribution of merchandise is reported larger and ex
panding and, in brief, commercial conditions all over the country are
much brighter than for some time back.
As for the statistical situation, the bank clearings last week
were 22.6 per cent larger than for the same week last year, with all
important cities except Pittsburg and Cleveland ranged in the in
crease column. This is the best showing made by the bank clear
ings for many months, and is highly gratifying. The gain at New
York was 33.2 per cent and at Chicago 7.4 per cent. The failures
were 200, against 172 last year.
Another cheerful feature is the strength shown by prices for
staple commodities. According to Bradstreet's index number quota
tions as a whole showed a small increase September 1 over August 1,
the principal strength being shown by groceries and provisions,
hides, leather, fruits, oils and breadstuffs. Reports from the iron and
steel trades say that recent reductions in quotations have stimulated
demand, that consumption has again overtaken production and that
stocks of crude material are much smaller than of late. Predictions
are being freely made by New York financial leaders, who are pre
sumably in close touch with the situation, that there is an impending
revival in this industry, and they are placing large sums in standard
dividend-paying stocks in proof that their co'nfidence is genuine.
This is having a stimulating effect on the stock market, which now
wears a bullish aspect, with the general tendency in prices no
longer downward, but upward. The public, too, are regaining con
fidence and are slowly re-enter;ng the market. This in turn, is
drawing on the supply of idle money so frequently mentioned during
the past few weeks and which is. now much less of a bugbear than
hitherto. The New York banks still report more funds on hand than
needed for all visible requirements and that there is therefore no
danger of any cash shortage, even in the moving of the crops, now
commencing.
The settlement of the packing-house strike in the West is an
other cheerful feature at the moment. It has been a sinister cloud on
all the markets of the West for two months and its disappearance
as an adverse factor cannot but be highly beneficial to business
throughout two-thirds of the country.
The manufacturers are also sending in better reports. Mills
heretofore idle are starting up, and while no great improvement in
the demand for manufactured goods is expected, all current indica
tions point to an enlargement in the general movement. Another
good sign is the return of 15,000 employes of the Pennsylvania sys
tem to full time. It will be remembered that some months ago sev
eral of the great railway systems sent a cold shiver through the
country by announcing a wholesale laying off of employes and a
corresponding reduction in wages, but this movement turned out
to be magnified, and half of it was not realized. So this bugbear, too.
has passed from the scene.
Domestic trade is making the best showing in the current ex
hibit, but the foreign commerce also seems to be improving, as the
figures of the export and import movements now coming in point to
a slow and healthy expansion over a month or so ago.
Conditions on this coast continue bright- While trade in many
lines shows a falling off in comparison with the past five or six years,
it is still good, with almost all farm and factory products passing 1
readily from first hands. into consumption, and, with the exception of
hay, prunes and raisins, there is no overstock of anything, while
most lines are showing a deficiency. Few complaints are heard, the
supply of money continues abundant, labor is completely employed,
real estate and building operations are ( active, the crops are good
and generally bringing prices above the normal, collections are easy,
and the foreign demand for our products is still excellent. There
is no trade depression anywhere on the coast, nor from present in
dications is there likelv to be.
BUSINESS BRIGHTENING.
THE MAN AND THE PURSE.
Rumor claims that a Washington
belle bjroke her engagement with a cer
tain Washington clubman "Just be
cause he carried his money in a purse,"
says the Washington Post.
"I can't abide," see Is quoted as say
ing, "a man who carries his change
in it. he 13 simply beyond hope, and
it's sure to follow that the man with
the little purse will be close about
everything. You may not notice It dur
ing your engagement, but be sure it
will come later.
"Fancy asking a man for money and
have him extract a miserable little
purse and begin digging down Into It,
half the time the little piece of leather
not being capable of holding the
amount" that one would ordinarily pay
for a simple frock." :;â¢-, ~ r .
And the matron to whom the young
belle confided the cause of the broken
engagement was heard to remark after
ward that she thought there was con
siderable truth and much wisdom in
the girl's idea of the thing.
FOR THE TABLE.
Molasses sauce for puddmgs â Cook
together for five minutes one cup of
molasses and one rounding tablespoon
of butter. When taken from the flre

Chocolate layer cakeâ Cream one-half

beat again, then add one cup of cold
water, one teaspoon or vanilla flavor

four level teaspoons of baking powder,
one-quarter teaspoon of salt and the
whites of three eggs beaten stiff. Bake
in layers."
PERFUME FOR THE BOW-WOWS.
One of the affectations among fashion
able women nowadays Is to hare some
distinctive note about their dress or
coiffure or little accessories of ward
robe, even if It be only some special
perfume which they endeavor to asso
ciate with their note paper, their visit
ing cards or their carriages, as well as
their dress. One would fain think this
Is enough, but according to the latest
advices some women even perfume
their pet dogs, %and their aim is to dis
cover some unique perfume and guard
its name as a jealous secret.
BEAD FRINGE.
Fringe of crystal or Iridescent beads,
sometimes interspersed with chenille or
silk threads, is effectively employed on
evening gowns. A tulle gown whose
flounces shaded from palest yellow, to
orange had between the flounces lines
of bead fringe repeating the same
tones.
COATS, TAFFETA AND IiACE.
A prevailing autumnal fashion will
be the closely fitting waistcoats. They
are now shown in delicately embroid
ered muslins and cambrics. As the sea
son advances silk and brocade will be
seen In conjunction with smart little
cutaway coats.
SHAM ROCK 'GO\VX.
A Brooklyn woman wears with much
pride a gown made from the sails of
Shamrock II. It is a yachting suit.
made with a bit of embroidery here
and there, shamrocks In shaded green
silk being the design. The costume is
a very attractive one.
The taffeta gown Is an Indispensable
change from the muslins and laces of
summer. Everybody has at least one of
these dresses In her wardrobe.
The owner of even a bit of real lace
Is nowadays making the most of her
possession, for scarcely any costume Is
seen without some lace decoration.

In order that they might be a great spirit
ual people, Moses exhorted. the Jews to strive
forever after eternal Ideal* of purity. Justice
and charity. A nation la exalted only by
righteousness and perpetuated by , the Ideals of
purity and Justice.
In the study of Jewish history we are Im
pressed with one great fact. The highest aim
at Moses, the greatest man in the history of
Israel, was to make Israel the greatest spirit
ual and ethical people. He sought to. havA
Israel forever as living witness of God. la
sacred literature the JewÂ» r are called witnesses
of God. Frederick the Great, who was under
the skeptical Influence of Voltaire, at one
time said to his chaplain: "'You talk all tho
time of. God and religion. Can ycu prove the
existence of God?" Th* reply was: "Tho
existence of ' the Jew proves the existence of
God.". ' j t V .-.-'
At the Bush'street synagogue Rabbi
Kaplan addressed a large audience.. His
subject was "Lest We -Forget." He
referred particularly to the ideals of
the day, saying in par t^:
Our meeting Is an emphasis 'of our belief
la a supreme God. We deem ourselves mem
bers of the great fraternity that has weaned
the rntran wcrlil of Its observations and has
brought the principles of a pure ialth within
the .reach of the nations of earth. We ac
knowledge tho call of God upon us. We make
solemn proclamation that he is our king- and
ruler and that there Is no power on earth
that can Induce us to compromise the solemn
truths ve have Inherited, for the reason that to
Christian arA. Turk aa well as to the Jew
these truths nave become the historic witnessed
of the conversion of the world to the sover
eignty of tha living God.
In the union of Israel .ind God lies one of
the world's greatest historical motives. We
do not insolently assert our existence to, be th3
only motive, but In thu intellectual iirog'res>8 of
humanity Israel has had and has Its appoint
ed place. Our political history is one of vlcls
situdps; cur social history one of scattering
and the constant removal of tents and homed,
but our spiritual history Is bright, exalting, a
page of the world's records that has no equal.
At sunset last night the celebration
of the Jewish New Year came to an
end. Services were held in the morn
ing in the different 'synagogues, with
the exception of Temple Emanu-El, and
throughout the afternoon calls were ex
changed. In the synagogues the chief
feature out of the ordinary was the
blowing of the ram's horn or shophar.
This is usually a feature of the first
day's celebration, but as the New' Year
fell on the Sabbath day it was post
poned until yesterday.
The reformed Jews celebrate but one
day and Rabbi Voorsanger of Temple
Emanu-E!,- as has been his custom,
preached yesterday tV> the Congregation

gogue. Dr. Voorsanger's subject was
"Where Art Thou?" He said in part:

Take your stand for a manlier, purer sim
plicity in living-, not in this thine only, but
all through. I tell you the heart of modern
lifn Is being eaten out of it by all this display
and catering to self-indulgence and measure-
Ires luxury. There is an immense deal to be
done. Have the laws obeyed, prevent men
from making a Kaln and profit cut of vice,
take your part in the struggle, and let tt be
the intelligent and fearless part of Christian
citizens.
! There are some persons who think they
know better than others how to live, and they
waste valuable time trying to make other*
live their way. Now, we have no right to com
pel others to live our way. What is meat for
one man may be poison for another. Thou
sands are harmed by the misuse of tobacco
and alcohol who have not the pluck to give
them up. There are those who* Insist that be
cause misuse of these things harms others,
no cne should use them. In a word; you must
not marry, because the man who is too poor
to marry is tempted. You must not drink tea;
because It excites that hysterical person, or
coffee, because It congests the brain of that
bilious one. You must not use cards ur bil
liards; you must not play, because some, it
they play, play too hard, and you must not
work, becauee some men work too hard. In
deed, there nevtr Â«was a cleaner example of
the argument "ad absurdum" than this theory,
which alwaj-6 has St., Paul's ."wherefore if
meat make my brother Mumble I will cat no
flesh while the world standeth" tacked on it.
as if this passage from that soldier of Christ
had anything to do with the matter.
It is not meat, but gormandizing that ruin*
the weak brother, it Is not drinking but guz
zling. Almost everything we put In our
mouths may be taken as a food or as a stimu
lant. Intemperance is never to be stopped,
Â«ith*r by law â which is the prohibition remedy
â or by tlie non-use of what may not be
harmful when not abused. Then we must re
member that to the laboring man alcohol sup
plies uomethlns which others get In other
ways and will not co without. _ Asking him
to Rive It up is like asking- the well-to-do not
to eo to the theater or concerts, not to read
novels or go to evening parties, but te sit at
home reading religious books. That is, it lifts
him for a moment Into another world, where
things s'em brighter and more beautiful.
Thero are- many things we- can all do for
temperance; we can offer every facility for
education, for cleanliness, for - i well-cooked
food (many children get a taste of alcohol In
the sour bread they eat), for well ventilated
dwellings, fcr whoUsome amusement. I do
not believe everv form of alcohol is a poison
from hell, but I do believe the saloon door,
wherever found, is an entrance way to perdi
tion. It is th-tse fermented loafing places that
tempt men and destroy them.
There "arc men smoklns or chewinz them
selves to death and eating themselves into
dydpeprla. and women drinking themselves
bilious with coffee and hysterical with tea, who
yet claim the -name "temperance." We have
not yÂ«t learned the alphabet of success In deal-
Ing with this matter.
It is the men we must change, 'and we must
do thut by - cractlcal methods. What I am
most anxious about is that those who so
believe in total abstinence should not feel
that is all that ran be don*, and that those
who do not bJlieve in It should not therefore
think they can do nothing. You may not be
able to believe these things are poisons, and
yet be sure the uxe of them Is a great deal
too common, rnd that the best thing is to let
th.-m alone.
The /act that a Bishop should assist In tht
formal opening- of such a place has shocked
many good people, and It is clear that the
great majority of clergymen and church lead
ers In this country are utterly out of sym
pathy with efforts to Christianize the saloon.
The newspapers are divided In their opinions.
Of course those who believe all drinking is
wrong have nothing but disapproval of the
j'lan. 1 But there are a good many other people
of alert conscience who do not share this
conviction. Bishop Potter believes saloons are
here to ntay. that they cannot be got rid of,
and that the next thine to do is to make the
bad yaloon a good saloon. Personally I da
not believe the thing can be done. 1 do not
believe there can be such a thing as a "good
saloon." I do believe a youth or a man could
get drunk at the Bishop's -bar as well as al
any other bar. And yet I would not Join the
hue and cry raided by fanatical men and
women who are not worthy to stand In the
good Bishop's shadow, and who have never
donated a tithe of the time and study to this
great problem that he has. Bishop Potter has
lived in the slums all through a hot summer,
and has devoted years of study to this whole
matter- of temperance. It seems to me the
part of wisdom to wait and see how the ex
periment will turn out.
"The Bishop and the Saloon," a sub
ject which has evoked volumes of com
ment from press and pulpit since Bish
op Potter dedicated the Subway saloon
in New York, was the theme discussed
yesterday morning by the Rev. Brad
ford Leavitt at the- First Unitarian
Church. Dr. Leavitt, while not express
ing an abiding faith in saloons as a
civilizing^ influence, dealt rather se
verely with the critics of the Bishop.

.Apropos to Junipero- Serra, Monterey
has announced to <the visitors, therein
the. name of the founder of California
as Funipero Serra. 'Tis so writ. on the
white cross that marks the spot where
he landed in the surf in 1770. Ye gods!
Is there no;one in Monterey who can
spell and print?
Now. as to the other name to be hon
ored, Starr King is mentioned, likewise
Leland Stanford, James Lick, James
Marshall, General John Sutter, Colonel
Baker and hosts of others of later date
âand no doubt tho list will grow with
the proverbial California virility.
OTHER NAMES -MENTIONED.
Right in the opening chapter of the
great California drama the seraphic
face of Junipero Serra rises above the
mistsof time. In all the pages of his
tory there are few such types as he,
combining in his great soul the quali
ties of courage, zeal, energ"y, faith, ab
negation, joyousness of heart, love of
mankind and absolute and unswerving
devotion to duty expressed in. his lov
ing allegiance to his Maker.
The occupation of Alta California was
the direct result of the ceaseless plead
ings of Junipero Serra before Carlos
HI. Won by his eloquence and zeal, the
King empowered the monk to enter the
unknown land and to take, the country
in the "name of God and the King,"
thus .directly influencing the political
complexion of the country. Soon after
the perilous voyage to San Diego Serra
dispatched Gaspar de Portola north
ward' with a band of .soldiers to find
the bay of Monterey. How the wan
derers passed it. without recognition
and going farther north discovered the
great bay of San- Francisco is an old,
old storyâ another triumph of Serra's
band.
The founding_pf the missions of San
Diego de Alcala.San Carlos de Borro
meo, San Antonio de Padua, San Ga
briel Archangel, San. Luis Obispo, San
Francisco de Asls, San Juan Capistra
no, Santa Clara/ San Buenaventura,
and the presidio of Santa Barbara were
likewise the direct results of Serra'a
labors as he journeyed from San Diego
to San Francisco twice or thrice a year
to visit his loved neophyte children.-
Thus have we a spiritual and moral
ideal in the brown-robed monk, and a
visual, physical influence upon the his
tory of thfc Westâ the first white leader
to come into the wilderness, where he
labored lovingly until the angel of
death stilled his voice and laid him to
rest in his beloved Carmel.
SERRA WORTHY OF PLACE.
Now the logical thing to do will be
to appoint a committee of men and
women familiar with the several
epochs â¢ of Calif ornian history, begin
ning with the landing of Fra Junipero
Serra at San Diego In 1763. to the pres
ent dayâ although a hero seldom
sprouts a halo till he's a long time
dead. However, the review of the
drama should be made from beginning
to end and made on broad lines, elim
inating religion, race and politics, and
basing the choice solely upon the char
acter of ~ man, his worth as a national
ideal and his direct lniluence upon the
State.
' There are some historians who would
go back to Sebastian Viscainoâ he who
landed at San Diego ana Monterey in
1602, pausing some days in each. port,
where religious services were held by
two Carmelite friars. While It Is' true
that it was Viscaino's description of
the country that guided Junipero Serra
160 years later, still the early voyager
left no direct influence upon the coun
try, save this diary. Therefore, it would
seem logical to "open the entries" in
1769. . . r
Now comes the all important ques
tion â whose memories shall .be perpet
uated in the eilent hall? â Shall they
be men of peace or men of war, men
of the soil or men of letters, men of
the pastoral days or men of the stars
and stripes? Ah! there is the question
â in fact, two questions, because there
are to be' two statues.
United States Senator Perkins has
been the promulgator of many a clever
coup for California, not the least of
which was the timely suggestion made
to the Pioneer Women at their annual
reception, that as the space allotted
to each State in Statuary Hall at
Washington has not yet- been claimed
by California, the Pioneer Women
take immediate steps toward filling
the two niches. For that suggestion,
publicly made, Senator Perkins, here's
to you!
Before the words were cold Mrs.
Anna Mclntyre, the president; Mrs.
Louise Shepheard Chase, and other
interested Pioneer Women had
gleaned from the Senator every de
tail of procedure In the matter, and
the mails a few days thereafter bore
to Washington a request for the pa
pers necessary to begin proceedings.
These state papers are now en route
to California, and thus will the way
soon be open for the queen Statue of
the West to present to the , hall of
fame her two most famous sons.
The strange apathy of Califprnians
in this matter has always been a sub
ject' of marvel to those who have
strayed through Statuary Hall, and
many sporadic discussions of it have
been heard. In fact, nearly, two' year3
ago, in the California Promotion Com
mittee's rooms, a sub-committee of the
California Landmarks League held >i
meeting, with Rufus P. Jennings, .Jo
seph R. Knowland, J. J. Lermen And
the secretary of the league jpresent.
at which this matter was vigorously
discussed. But there was at that time
much for the league to do and the
matter was dropped temporarily.
TAKEN UP AS SOLE OBJECT.
But now that some one organization
has singled out this duty, specialized
on this one phase of activity, success
will follow. â¢ And what body is more
fit to carry out this work than the
Pioneer Women â they who toiled
sturdily to shape the destiny of the
State?

Water Front Notes.
The. scow schooner Emily Mark, with a deck
load of wood, sailing up the. bay late yester
day afternoon, -collided with a sailboat. The
scow, caught the smaller craft, on her. broad
bow.atid took it with her on her way. The
sailboat did not fill or capsize and as it could
not get . away from the . other vessel it was
pushed up the bay till the schooner anchored
and her motion- was checked. The skipper, -who
was .very j much intoxicated, was too- helpless
to make an effort I to Â¦ txtrlcate himself, so he
simply looked on.
An Odd Collision.
I The pilot boa^ Grade S, while coming
around for her trip to sea yesterday
afternoon, was : caught. by , the tide and
plunged into Mciggs wharf. 1 Her, sharp
wooden stem - cut through" the heavy
timbers and * - planks like . a . ' . knife
through Â¦ cheese, for about ten feet.
There were many people on the wharf
watching the Russian cruiser and when
the ; Gracie went alicing into the floor
ing, under their feet there was a scat
tering. When the jaunty little craft
backed away -from ' the wreck it was
seen that she was not damaged 'at all.

THE SAN FRANCISCO -'CALLJ] MONDAY; /SEPTEMBER ,12, 1904.
The cause of the catastrophe) la not
known, although B. B. Whitney, local
Inspector of hulls and boilers, believes
that some one maliciously left open a
port hole or dead light.
At 5:15 o'clock this afternoon tho
Topeka was moved from her berth at
the Ocean dock to Pier A to finish
loading her cargo. At 6 o'clock some
bystanders on the wharf noticed that
she suddenly listed to the starboard
slightly. At first they thought they
might be mistaken, but a moment later
she went over about a foot. -There
could be no mistake about it now.
The men who were working aboard
the vessel came ashore with a rush.
Soon the Topeka went down faster
and her guy ropes snapped with a
crash. By this time an immense crowd
had congregated, .but there was noth
ing to do but watch and see what
would happen.
Pretty soon the water was up' to the
deck. Then the action was faster, and
in forty minutes from the tfme the list
was first noticed the Topeka was un
der water. Prior to the time she com
menced to take water she was well
balanced and there was nothing to in
dicate that .ler cargo was not loaded
properly. She took water from some
point below the water line, but exactly
where no one knows.
Only a short time ago the Topeka
was overhauled and put in perfect
condition. She passed inspection only a
month ago. Inspector Whitney says
that his assistant said that the To
peka was in first-class condition. The
loss will probably be about $100,000, in
cluding the cargo, which consisted of
500 tons of general merchandise.
SEATTLE, Wash., Sept. 1Lâ The>
steamship City of Topeka went down to
the bottom of the bay this evening 1 .
Nothing: but her smokestack is above
water and her cargo Is floating about
In the water. No -lives were lost.

Defeat the Pacific Eleven
in a Well-Fought Contest
ENCINAL TEAM
IS VICTORIOUS
After ten days of hard tournament
play most of'.the" tennis experts took.;a
day oft : yesterday for a needed rest.
Few matches were played on the Cali
fornia Club courts, and. even the pub
lic courts at Golden Gate Park were
not as well attended as usual.
The announcement that- the Sutton
sisters would play at the > park yester
day afternoon brought an. unusual
number of spectators â¢ to . the courts.
They were doomed to disappointment,
however, as the Suttons decided a pub
lic exhibition on Sunday would not
meet with the approval of their father.
The spectators had' to satisfy them
selves ' with an *t impromptu Â¦ doubles
match between four of the public court
experts.
R. N. Whitney and Clarence Griffin,
who defeated Charles ; Dunlap and
Charles Foley In a close five-set match
at San Rafael, lost" to their opponents.
It was in the nature of a return match,
but there was nothing at stake and the
players did not exert themselves as
they. would in a tournament: It was a
pretty match to look at, and. those who
Journeyed to the park specially to,Â»ee
the Suttons almost forgot the non-ap
pearance of the famous sisters.
Three of the five sets playea went to
7â5. Whitney and Griffin won the first
Bet, but their opponents took the sec
ond set without losing a game. The
fifth and deciding set. Foley and Dun
lap won rather easily. The score was
5â7, 6â0, 7â5, 5â7, 6â2.
On the California Club courts Harold
Gabriel, .one of the coming, younÂ£ ex
perts, took the veteran Harry Haight
Into camp." 'Gabriel is fast- developing
Into a crack and can give some of the
first class men a Vub. Gabriel won tw.o
sets, 7â5 and 6â0, and Haight took the
third set, 6-^0.
Frank Mitchell and ' Harry Butler
played a close one-set match with the
Smith brothers. The latter were, ahead
almost all th"e ' way. ' but .Mitchell arid
Butler won out, 11 â 9. . â¢ :
Melville Long was in'goOd form, and
after lo'sing the first set won the next
two from Robert Drolla. - . \>
W. Knowlton and Edwln-Robbins
played the closest match of the day.
Robbins won all three sets., the first
two of which went to 10 â 8.
The following matches were played:
Melville Long beat RobÂ«rt D. Rolla. 3-6,
0-2 C-4; W. G. Knowlton was beaten by Ed
win Robbln*. 30-3, JO-S, C-3; Frank MltcheU
snd Harry Bi'-tler bent Grant and Chester
Smith 11-9: Hnrrv Gabriel beat Harry Haight,
7-5 <M) 0-0: H. E." Punnett tied Dr. Younger,
0-4 5-7: Gabriel beat W. Little. 0-2: Knowlton
beat UttK 6-4, 8-6. .
The championship tourna^nent will be
brought to a close this morning at San
Rafael, . The : challenge Â¦ match between
Alfonzo Bell, the champion, and Drum
mond MacGayin; the challenger,. which
was commenced ! Saturday afternoon, j
will be completed this morning. Mac-
Gavin has two sets* 'to his '.credit and
needs but one more to win the'eham
pionship. On the other hand. Bell must
win three straight sets to retain his
title. i
The champion will undoubtedly play
better than he did on Saturday, when
he was fatigued from his long trip.
MacGavln was playing the game of his
life when the match' was postponed. If
he can play as well as he did Saturday
Bell's chances of retaining the cham
pionship are slim. Bell cannot beat the'
game MacGavln was playing, but the
latter may not do so well this morning.
If Bell gets a good start MacG&vin wilJ
have no easy time getting the set he
needs. It seems likely MacGavin. will
be the 1904 champion of the coast. .. ;

In the open stake honors went to

extra course in the final, as Ouida was
unsighted on the first hare released.
Loretta raced after It ajone, taking the
steam out of her. Loretta sold favor
ite, but after the first trial the talent
switched to Ouida. The pikers had a
hard day of it, as short ends could be

Pocatelli, the great son of Emin
Pasha, defeated the best greyhounds.'in
training yesterday and won the Cham
pion stake at Ingleside Coursing Park.
Xethercott's courser is undoubtedly the
fastest dog in training at the present
time. He defeated in succession Tom
King, Rector, McVey and ValleyPrlde,
the pick of the coast greyhounds. When
he led McVey in the third round he
was heartily cheered, as he gave his
opponent but-, one point against the six
teen he had scored. In the deciding
trial the ' talent made him an over
v helming favorite over Valley Pride;
which he defeated with. ease in a trial
extending two minutes.
The running of three stakes furnished
some excellent trials. The dogs- were
evenly matched, and in many of the
races it was hard to separate the dogs
in the run up to_the hare.
The Referee defeated Lucy Clair in
the deciding course of. the class stake
after the latter had done the early
work in the course. - '

and it was curtains with the Com

Schmidt then took the slab, and after
that the Seals kept away from the
plate. It might have been a blank all
the way for them had the smiling
pretzel shooter been officiating all the
way through. As it was, Schmidt com
pleted twenty-three innings for the
week without allowing a run.
Wheeler was rather wild at times, but
his glow ball was'a mystifier, to which
the Commuters never could get Jerry.
Dunleavy ran back and* took Hilde

1XGEL5 FAST OS THE BASES.
Uncle and the Seals had a good day
yesterday on the baseball diamond.
They played the fame twice and nosed
the Commuters to the finish in each in
stance. They hit the ball cleverly, ran
bases like big leaguers and fielded bet
ter by far than Oakland. Scores: Morn
ing game â San Francisco 5, Oakland 4.
Afternoon game â San Francisco 7, Oak
land 1-
The afternoon game gave the Seals a
chance to show the fans how they can
wallop the leather sometimes. After
starting with a lead of a pair in the
first spasm, they resumed their batting
carnival in the fourth", and no one
etopped till five tallies had been chased
over and the game was broken up for
a fair-ye-well.
Dr. lloskiman got his, and it was
that old fatal bases on balls which put
him out of the going. After Irwin had
been retired in the fourth Anderson
waded into a curve and chopped it out
to left Held for a couple of bags. Then,
with two strikes on Gochnauer, Moski
man got erratic and passed him. Gor
ton made the second out with a fly to
Kruger.
Wheeler was there with his little old
hit to the left garden, chasing ''Wooden
Shoes" to the pan. Van Buren bit off a
two-packer down the first base line
and Gochnauer arrived. Moskiman
fitew bad again and hit Hildebrand in
the slats, creating a full house. Wal-

scores:
In the prize pistol contest of the Gold

rings, being the possible, and carried
off the handsome bronze statue given
by Captain LÂ». Siebe. He was closely
followed by G. Frahm, with 97 rings to
his credit. . â¢
August Pape made the excellent score
of 11 red flags on his thirty-shot ticket
and carried off the premium for this
event;
Shell Mound Park was crowded yes
terday with marksmen. The day was
an ideal one for rifle shooting, as the
light was soft, with just enough wind
blowing to carry off the powder smoke.
There were two big events on the cards,
the forty-sixth annual public prize com
petition of the San Francisco Schuetzen
Verefn and the open-for-all pistol
match of the Golden Gate Rifle and
Pistol Club. In addition the veterans
of Company A, National Guard of Cal

pany and the Independent Rifles
brought out a large contingent for their
regular monthly shoots.
In the point shooting of the San
Francisco Schuetzen Verein David Sal
field carried off the honors, scoring 431.
He was followed by A. Pape with 423.
Max Kolander was the man to win the
prize for scoring the first 100 points. It
took him Just one hour, during which
he fired 120 shots.

The two-mile handicap was the most
spectacular race of the day. It was
the only one in which there was a bad
looking fall. Some rider went down
on the first turn of the second mile. A
number of others who could not dodgo
the prostrate rider were also thrown.
A number of them lost some cuticle,
but no bones were broken. Mershon of
Reno worked his way into a good posi
tion and when sprinting commenced
he was ln the front and had a clear
track. He won by half a wheel's
length.
The motor races attracted small
fields and the competition was not
keen. Frank Carroll won the most ex
citing of these races. Three men were
started a third of & mile apart. Caf
toII overtook the second of his op
ponents after traveling seven miles.
The dull weather had a depressing
effect on both the attendance and the
competition. The average time was
slow. The resuUs in detail:

The five mile championship was run
under navel conditions. There were six
starters and it was agreed the last man

The arts of diplomacy may be called
into play to avert international com
plications between Germany and the
United States in connection with the
arrest of a sailor on board of the
German ship Hathor, lying at Union
street wharf.
The sailor, Oscar- Beine, was in a
saloon; it is alleged, at 1 Vallejo
street about 3 o'clock yesterday morn
ing. He quarreled with Charles
Schmidt, the bartender, and threw a
heavy beer glass at SdhmidL The
glass hit Schmidt on. the head,
inflicting a wound . two Inches long.
Schmidt was taken to the Harbor
Emergency Hospital, where the wound
was stitched and dressed.
Beine, after leaving the saloon,
went on board ship. Acting Lieuten
ant Cook at the Harbor station in
structed Sergeant Ellis to board the
ship and arrest Beine, as he had com
mitted a felony. Ellis took with him
Policemen Becker, Hightower and
Morris.
When the policemen reached the
wharf the watchman told them that
the captain of the Hathor and First
Officer Miller were 'on shore. While
they were talking Miller appeared and
Ellis explained to him what they
wanted. Miller replied that they
could not â¢ get aboard the ship till 8
o'clock in the morninsr. Ellis tele
phoned to Cook, who ordered him to
board the vessel at once and arrest
Beine.
Ellis and his men went on board,
and after knocking on the cabin door
for about five minutes, Miller opened
it and ordered the police to leave the
ship. Ellis refused and told his men
to search the forecastle- for- Beine.
Miller ordered the crew to haul in the
gangplank, and turning to Ellis, said:
"This is a German ship, flying the
German flag, and no one can take a
man off -without a written order from
the German Consul. I will pull in the
gangplank and 1 keep you on board."
Ellis replied that he could pull in
the gangplank ; if he felt that way,
but if Beine were found he would be
taken ashore as a prisoner. . Beine
was discovered in the forecastle and
placed under arrest. . Miller . con
versed with 'Beine in German and then
said to Ellis: "You can- take him
ashore, but I will report you tÂ© the
German Consul.'' ". - .
Beine was taken to the City Prison
and booked on - a charge of assault
with a deadly weapon. He denies that
he was in the saloon at : 1 Vallejo
street and asserts that he returned to
the vessel about midnight.

The police are industriously searching
for the rest of the card sharps and
hope soon to land them behind the
bars. They have received other com
plaints from people who were victim
ized by the card sharp gang, but re
fuse to make them public.
It is rumored around the Hall of Jus
tice that Joe King will be cited to ap
pear before the Police Commission to
show cause why his liquor license
should not be revoked, and that the
commission will investigate the playing
of poker in the hotels about town.
Quallo and Kenworth have been posi
tively identified by King. Ryan and
Taylor are now searching for the other
members of the gang. It is said that
a miner named Steele from Tonopah
was also induced to Join the game and
dropped $1000 before he concluded that
it was too one-sided for him.
Kenworth was arrested on Saturday
night at the -New Western Hotel by
Detectives Ryan and Taylor. Quallo
was found yesterday morning in his
wife's rooms at 17 Third street by the
same officers. His wife is a profes
sional fortune teller and clairvoyant.
The police say that Quallo was the
leader of the gang and may. have re
ceived the information from his wife
that King was a likely subject i for
fleecing. Kenworth and three others
who took part in the games came from
Tonopah, Nevada, It is supposed at
Quallc's suggestion, j
Two of the men who relieved "Joe"
King, proprietor of the New Western
Hotel, of $4000 by means of marked
cards at a series of poker games are in
"the tanks" at the City Prison. They
will be charged* with grand larceny by
trick and device, and the marked cards
will be booked as evidence against
them. They are J. C. Kenworth, known
as "Colonel," and R. H. Quallo, known
as "Count."

WELL-KNOWN
EDUCATOR IS
CALLED TO REST
James H. Garrick, watchman on
the wrecker Catalina. which lies in
the bay:at South â¢ San Francisco, off
Krohnln's shipyard, was drowned
early yesterday morning. He and a
friend, John Lynch, were drinking on
shore till late Saturday night. They
took a . small skiff from the shipyard
and rowed to the wrecker to get a
book that Garrick wanted.
On their return the skiff struck
against a breakwater and began to fill
with water. Garrick ' called out to
Lynch: "The boat is sinking; swim
for your life." Both Jumped into the
bay and Lynch, after swimming nearly
a quarter of a mile, reached the
shore exhausted. As quickly as pos
sible he raised , an alarm and several
residents in the neighborhood put off
in boats }n search ; of Garrick. The
body was not discovered x till day
break. It was lying in the mud off
Watt's Point, about a quarter of a
mile from where the skiff struck the
breakwater. Garrick had apparently
struck out in the wrong direction and
swam until he . got entangled in the
mud. The body was towed ashore.
i The Morgue was notified and the
body removed there by Deputy Coro
ner Meehan. Garrick was a married
man and lived "at 212% Perry street.
He was on -board the steamer Pro
greso when the explosion took place
about three years ago, .while she was
lying at- the Fulton Iron Works. He
lost his right eye at that time.

AND SMALli BOY â¢ IS [ HAPPY
If the amusement seeking public is
anxious j to enjoy a juvenile perform
ance the opportunity is, afforded It this
week at the Grand. Opera-house, where
the musical extravagansa, "Princess
Fan Tan," opened yesterday with
the unqualified / approbation of two
very enthusiastic audiences. The
production .is an Interesting . ? one,
the scenery and costumes be
ing very picturesque and elaborate and
the cast of children "is 'decidedly, the
best. The lyrics are bright and catchy
and the dialogue is profuse with clever
witticisms/ Eunice Â¦ Gilman makes j a
great j hit in the title roleJ I The little
miss sings and dances herself into the
good graces of the audience and is lav
ishly rewarded In the way ; of applause
and encores. . Marie Nichols is also
very fetching in Prince Co , Co and a
pleasing, feature of the performance.
The ballets, "The Feast of the Chrys
anthemums," "Love's .. Triumph" and
the "Early Day* , ' of California" i are
also deserving of praise, for the host
of children who dance them exhibit a
degree of grace, precision ; and â¢ agility
that would do credit to " their elders.
A . marvel in .Terpslchorean way is
little Jasmine Sldlowski; whose feats
of .toe dancing; are I very -creditable" to
one of her, years. Â¦ One is - readily im
pressed with the- freshness of the chil
dren's voices, , which, are. heard to j par

' The Orpheum last night played to Its
usual crowded house. The best of; the
new . sketches is "The \ Sailor and the
Horse.',' in which Harry LaRose and
"Will Halliday shine, but 'the new fea
tures are not brilliant. /
Leo Carrillo, who made his debut last
night under favorable circumstances,
pleased the large audience with his
imitations and showed a great .deal of
repose. His work suffers, however, by
the poor sketch in which it is served
up. His encore story was the cleverest
and might be used among his intro
ductory jokes with better result. Mar
ion Bent and Pat.-Rboney showed to
advantage in some graceful dancing.
Miss Bent was winsome and pleasing
and Rooney is an expert clog dancer.
The remainder of the new bill is only
fair, but the leftovers from last' week
are all good. ,.'..'
There is enough good in the play
to make something worth while. One
wonders whether the . author-angel,
Guimera, did it. all. ; Some of those
lines were specially written for Flor
ence-Roberts â that is evident. The
star is lust as tumultuous - and con
vincing in the fallen woman as of old.
The tale is of a tyrannical Spanish
landlord, who has among : his vassals a
girl, Marta. Â¦ To conceal his passion he
secures a husband of convenience for
her, Manellch, a goatherd from the
hills. 'Marta and the husband rebel and
go back to the hills after Manelich has
strangled Sebastian in approved Zola
esque fashion in the presence of Marta.
Beautiful as bits ..of â¢ the "Sunken
Bell" are some; of the lines given to
Manelich. "I prayed for a good wife.
One day I whirled my sling about my
head, and the rock fell into the low
lands. I; knew then she would come
from . the lowlands." . . x
If there is such a thing as a child
actress, . Ollie â¢ Cooper was one last
night. She was the "chee-ild" in
'"Zaza" in the Alcazar days. Then she
was a little automaton with a black
smith's voice. But last night she was
remarkable. Â¦ â¢
The star was the star of "Saphb"
and "Zaza." Marta gave the same
whine emitted , by' the other/ two,
"I am not wholly dead." Florence
Roberts . can do that well. It caught
the gallery at the California as it did
the uDper:circle.at the Alcazar. .
' Marta received the beating â was
hurled to â¢ the ground j by both her
good and her bad lover. All Roberts'
heroines are beaten. "Strike me,"
she implores, even as did Sapho, Zaza
and Carmen. . .
"Sapho" is a tract and "Zaza". a
sermon compared to- "Marta: of -the
Lowlands." It is. the climax. of Rob
erts-Nethersoleism.
?There is no disrobing act, no enter
ing of bedroom, but the intimations
are as clear and artistic as a bit 'of
thp Decameron.. The husband of con
venience and -the hurling to , the
ground business, which was also in
"Sapho" and VZaza," should have been
enough. Miss Roberts' clientele,
who must have a fallen woman, would
have been satisfied with*those. "Marta
of the Lowlands" gave them more
than' enough. ..-. â¢
Part of that first scene â those who
were there, knqw what partâ was sug
gestive of some pages from the paper
covered' books that Uncle Sam's mail
refuses to handle. *A scenes in an
open-air: bridal chamber â -that aeema
a trifle more than risaue. \
Bits of .the play were strong, bits of It
were pretty, and bits of it bordered on
the ; melodramatic. \ Lucieh Henderson's
"So you were going to runaway, eh?"
brought back fond memories;of Legree
in "Uncle Tom's. Cabin."
Hobart Bosworth as the goatherd who
had { been picked ' for the husband of
convenience. made the house listen and
look at all times. His simple, giant im
personation i was a little too simple at
first, but'afterward it was wonderful. â¢
