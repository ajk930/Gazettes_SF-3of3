Attorney Dibble began with - a compli
ment to Ferral on his eloquence.
"No more effective edvocate evar ad
dresed a jury than Judge Ferral," he.be
gan. "I Indorse everything he has said
about keeping the. ballot pure and about
the duty of the Jury.
"But the ballot is not the only one of
our Institutions that needs protection; :lt

;"The Jury i stands between' oppression

During the denunciation, Ferral wheeled
about . several times, pointing ; to Maes

and pretended to be writing.

"If the president of the Board of

office?
"It Is no longer a farce to send cor
rupt election officers to San Quentin.

use.

"Wouldn't anybody under those circum
stances erect a magnificent statue on the
eltar of "friendship? Friendship may cut
come figure in this case, but self-protec
ticn had much more to do than friendship
in Maestretti* s standing by Wyman.
"Gentlemen of the Jury, a technicality
fcas been advanced by the defense. Pub
lic officer, gentleman, man of influence to
make that fight? "The. thing wasn't done
before the preliminary examination, and
therefore he must be acquitted.' "
"When they made that defense, l caw
that it was a dangerous admission. They
could not etand up and meet the issue
without resorting to technicalities."
At this point Governor Budd jumped up
and interposed a sharp objection. He was
rebuked by the court. *
"Firstâ Maestretti was the master spir
it, the engineer, the boss of that precinct.
"Secondâ Maestretti In the Wyman case
acted like a guilty man. In trying . to
shield Wyman he was ehieldlng himself.
"Wyman knew when he voted fraudulent
ly that it was done in the interests of
Maestretti. He would have Maestretti in
his power if be should choose to talk.
"We find whom rushing to Wyman's
rescue? This defendant. Himself a sworn
public officer, one Intrusted with large
powers, yet he Is the first to rush to the
rescue of the accused stutter. If one's
friend becomes a malefactor, friendship
ceases. Putting a premium on that crime
â that Is what Maestretti was doing. Wy
rr.an acd Maestretti are like the Siamese
twins: . if you separate them they die.
Perhaps tfceir separation will not be long
"I lay these tdcts down:
"That primary election precinct of the
district in which this defendant was the
boÂ£s was corrupt to rottenness. It was a
stench to this city and county and to the
people of the entire State.
"Who appointed men like Silberstein
end Podd as officers in an American elec
tion? They could not have been appoint
ed without the influence of tWg defend
ant. Eiiberetein declared openly that he
was appointed through the influence of
Maestretti and Ruef.
â¢â¢The crime strikes at the foundations
of the Government itself. The man
who attempts to outrage the purity of
the ballot, the man wbo engage* In
what I* known an stuffing/, tries to
prostitute the onilot, Is more dangerous
than any footpad. â¢
"This crime reaches to courts, Judge*
and juxie*. It paralyzes administra
tions and makes self-covernment a
farce and sometimes a curse.
ISES STRONG LANGUAGE.
*"There has been much outside matter
dragged into this case," began Ferral.
*Sluch levity has bee*n thrown in, all
in an attempt to affect this jury, and
an effort has been made to laugh this
case out of court. But despite all this,
despite my athletic and vociferous
friend, the fact remains that this is one
cf the most important cases that ever
came up In any court.
"I don't mind looking at you. Gov
ernor," replied Ferral, "but I've seen
handsomer men.** ' â¢
Judgre Lawlor's courtroom was jam

Axtorney Ferral rose to open the ar

pausing to banter with Governor Budd.
tut when he "warmed up," denuncia
tion that stung and smarted poured

character of Maestretti to shreds.
As Ferral stepped inside the rail to

chair, remarking-. "I want to be where
I can face you. Bob."
Assistant District Attorney Ferral
made tte opening argument for the
prosecution. There was no mincing of
words in his spetch. In a snappy, vi

The fact that some- of the relatives of
the deceased were notified of the acci
dent twenty-four hours ahead of the
Treasury Department was explained as
follows: %
"The officers of the service. In the event
of an accident or death, out of sympathy,

wife, mother or other relative of the de
ceased, and later report to the depart
ment, i Wo received a report on the morn-

on j the evening of the 6th. If there are
any suspicious circumstances attending
this accident, of which we have been ad
vised and are unwilling to believe In the
absence of information. thÂ« board which

Into them." Â«
Mrs. 'Louisa Blasdal and her son win
remain in Washington until a report has
been received by the Treasury Depart

the meantime that the body has been re

"Lieutenant Blasdel certainly had no
enemies aboard the Rush." said another
official, "and his duties must have been
very., pleasant, for only recently a deaira
was expressed that he should continue on
that vessel instead of being given an
other assignment."
Officials of the revenue cutter service

tenant Blasdel was purely accidental, and
they scout the Idea that the officer had a
single enemy aboard the vessel. Not
long since a sailor fell overboard near
the same spot In daylight and was
drowned -In the swift undertow before
help could be rendered. There is, much
doubt that Lieutenant Blasdel's body caa
be recovered.
FULL INQUIRY PRO3IISED.
When Mrs. Blasdel. the mother of de
ceased, accompanied by a younger son,
visited the Treasury Department to-day
Assistant Secretary Keep showed her the
following report from Captain Tuttle of
the Rush, which was received yesterday:
"SAUSALITO. CaL. June 7. 1305.âSec
retary of the Treasury. "Washington, I>.
C: At 1:30 a. ra. June 6 Blasdel said to
Rldgely, the first lieutenant. 'I am going
on deck for a moment and shall then
turn in.' After some minutes, as he did
not return. Ridgely went up to see where
he was. He was not found. Inquiry from
the quartermaster on watch showed that
Blasdel had not been seen on deck. The
only theory we have is that he went to
the port gangway and on the slippery
brass lining lost his foothold and on fall
ing struck his head, making him uncon
seioes and unable to call for help. When
missed every effort for several hours was
made to find If be was floating In the
harbor. The search was unsuccessful
Report has been mailed to department.

rigid investigation of the facts pertain
ing to the mysterious death of Lieutenant
Blasdel of New Orleans at Sausallto
early on the morning of June 8. The rev
enue cutter Rush had returned from
Seattle only the day previous and was
lying In Richardsons Cove, when at 1:33
o'clock In the morning Lieutenant Bias
del was reported missing. It was sup
posed that he fell from, the port gangway
of the vessel and was drowned, his body
being carried away In the swift current.
t Because no one saw the oi3cer leave the
deck and because Intimations that he
may have had an enemy on the vessel,
as well as to soothe an anxious mother
and brother, who are in Washington to
learn the particulars of the tragedy and
who ' Suspect foul play. Secretary Keep
decided to anpoint a board of officers not

The subject of Benn's address was
"muzzles In Pennsylvania" and his at
tack was directed against the late Sen
ator Matthew S. Quay and his bio
grapher, Governor Pennypacker. His
action took Quay's friends In the conven
tion completely by surprise. To-night F.
B. McKee of Freeport, T. H. Harter of
Bellefonte and F. B. .Phelpsof Erie, Pa.,
assert that they will present a resolution
to-morrow condemning Benn's course.
Benn, in his address, reviewed the or
ganization of the Quay machine and the
events leading up to the passage of the
Penuypacker libel law. He blamed Quay
for this severe law, claiming that .it
was Quay's Governor that instigated it.
He closed by saying: -. ,
There never wu Â« Quay or Pennypacker
born who could form or invent a measure that
would restrict the liberty of the press or ham
per, it In its constitutional right of public
utterance. If th-s Quays of . Pennsylvania de
sire unemlrcned biographies, let them leave
behind th*m records free from stain. If \u25a0 the
Pcnnypackers of Pennsylvania or any other
commonwealth in the Unllon desires to ef
fectually muzzle the press, they must hie them
selves to some other land than that' in the
fundamental law of which It Is written: "The
freedom of the press ought not \u25a0 to be re
stricted." ?

While officially the matter has not' been
turned over to Newell' s departmentv by the
Secretary ot the Interior as yet. the District
Attorney found it necessary to confer with the
chief engineer upon technical issues which
will arise during the hearing of the suit.
"Reclamation work is now under way to thir
teen States and three Territories," said Xewell.
"and I do not believe any other great projects
will be outlined within the next ten years.
The work already projected contemplates the
expenditure cf the appropriation for the .next
five years, an aggregate of $30,000,000, which
means the reclamation of 1,000,000 acres of
arid land."
United States District Attorney Cranston
and Chief Engineer F. H. Newell of the recla
mation service were in conference for two
hours to-day, discussing the technical and
Ircal phases cf the Gore Canyon controversy
between the Federal Government and the Mof

Domestic service, compared to factory
and store work for girls, was presented
by Mrs. Rita C. Dorr of New York. She
deplored the conditions affecting work
ing women, and especially waitresses, and
as-ked the clubwomen to petition Congress
to conduct an investigation of these con
ditions. In spite of the prevailing evils,
she claimed girls preferred factory and
store work to domestic service.
Miss Susan Hayes Ward of Newark
made an address last night on "Arts and
Crafts as Applied to Home Industry."
She took occasion to make a strong plea
for the return of hand work and severely
criticized the women of to-day for their
inability -to originate and complete ar
ticles made by hand. She declared that
the foremothers of the women of to-day
were really more intelligent than present
day women, though the latter had more;
book knowledge and mental culture. '..â¢ ' \
There was a warm discussion of the
question of whether to eliminate the so
cial feature at the next biennial. Mrs.
Philip N. Moore spoke strongly for the
social element at biennials and was fol
lowed by Mrs. Charles B. Yardley of
East Orange, who urged that the social
feature was indispensable as a break to
the business session. In speaking against
this feature, Mrs. Evelyn A. Flake of
Illinois asserted that "We . should eppy
after our brothers, who do not dissipate
their time with frivolity," and attend to
business first.
The councU adopted resolutions pre
sented by Mrs. (Florence Kelley, secre
tary of the Consumers' League, recom
mending to the clubwomen of the coun
try concerted efforts to obtain legal pro
tection for working girls under 18 years,
by striving to nave lawn passed restrict
ing employment to eight hours a day, or
forty-eight hours a week. Mrs. Kelley
told of the success of such laws in Ohio
and Colorado, and of t-e direful results
to hundreds 6f girls in other States not
having such protection.
ATLANTIC CITY, June B.â Questions of
vast importance to clubwomen through
out the country were discussed at the
council of the General Federation of

broader worn and more vital results were
made. The "yellow peril" and "graft"
are among some of the questions which
came up for discussion.
That the woman's club is a non-profes
sional university for women in their sec
ond youth was the burden of an address
by Mrs. Anna Garland Spencer of New
York, who wat the first speaker at the
council meeting to-day. She declared that
the club movement was two-fo-ldâ the
first, for self-culture; the second, for the
betterment of social conditions.

CHICAGO, June S.â The teamsters'
strike has, reached the point where its
further . progress and its further In
crease- â¢ are dependent upon the action
taken by the members of the Chicago
Team Owners* Association. This or
ganization has from the first declined
to make deliveries to. the boycotted
houses, and has constantly urged the
teamsters to arbitrate the auestioh of
making such deliveries. The team
sters have positively refused to deliver
or receive goods, and now, - the last
chance of securing any concessions
from the teamsters haying faded away,
the members of the Team Owners' As-^
sociation must either decide to deliver
goods or allow the teamsters to have
their own way In the matter.
Opinion among. the members of the
Team Owners' Association is strongly
divided, and the result may be a split
in its ranks. A meeting of the organi
zation will be held "to-morrow night,
and the action taken at that time will
largely determine the future scope of
the strike. â¢ If the Team Owners' As-:
sociation . decides to make deliveries
and discharge all of its men *who re
fuse to obey orders, the ranks of the
strikers will be increased about 8000
men. - - "'" ' . '

PR. PIERCES REMEDIES.
WELCOME WORDS
TO WOMEN.
Women who suffer with disorderspeca-
iiax to their sex should write to Dr. Pierce
and receive free the advice of a physician
of over forty years' experienceâ a skilled
and successful specialist in the diseases
of women. Every letter has the most
careful consideration and is regarded a.l
sacredly confidential. Many sensitively
modest women wrfte fully to Dr* Pierce
what they would shrink from telling to
their local physician. The local physician
Is pretty sure to say that he cannot do
anything without "an examination." Dr.
Pierce holds that these distasteful exam-
inations are generally needless, arid that
no woman, except in rare cases, should
submit to them. \u25a0
Dr. Pierces treatment cures in the
privacy of your home. His "Favorite
Prescription" has cured hundreds of
thousands of bad cases. It is the only
medicine of its kind that is the product
of a regularly graduated physician. Some
unscrupulous medicine dealers may offer

The explosion at first reported was

Count . Cassini, the Russian Embas

President, and it is impossible to ob
tain any Information regarding the ca
blegrams that have reached the em
bassy from St. Petersburg in, the last
twenty-four hours.
* Strong - hopes were entertained here
In . the highest circles that London
could be relied on for active assistance
in counseling moderation to Japan.
These hopes have not yet been realized,
although Information has- been re
ceived-that, Great Britain will, welcome
peace. *It Is still hoped, however, that
some assistance from that quarter may
yet be forthcoming. Berlin and Paris
aro both giving loyal assistance to the
efforts initiated In Washington, and the
result- of Berlin's activity is already
being felt. â¢ Further j Instructions have

Later In the afternoon Sir Morti
mer Durand, ' the British Embassador,
saw the President, and to-night Baron
Speck yon Sternburg:, the German Em
bassador, was at the White House for
nearly an hour. None of. the callers
would discuss their visits, and it can
be stated that, with the exception of
the call of Takahira, none of these
visits, was of great importance.
It is not expected that the situation
will change radically In the next day or
two., Until some indication comes from
Japan of her attitude, in the light of
the spirit shown by the Czar, the nego
tiations can hardly be expected to pro
gress. Meantime,' powerful, though
friendly, influence Is being' brought to
bear on Japan to be moderate in her
demands. It has been pointed out that
Japan and Russia must always be close
neighbors, and that if Japan Is unrea
sonable now In her great triumph she
might again be Involved In war with
Russia. What effect these representa
tions may "have on the Mikado is, of
course, only" conjectural. \ . \'-
Early In the afternoon Baron Ka
neko, the Japanese financial adviser,
was received by the President and dis
cussed the whole situation for some
time. Baron Kaneko to-night said that
Japan had not received, directly or In
directly, any request from Russia for
a statement of peace terms.. It was In
timated that Japan would be loth to
give any such statement until con
vinced that Russia was prepared to
take. up the question of peace with the
intention of ending the war.
WASHINGTON. June S.â The Czar
has at last been hea,rd from- here, and
the result is not unfavorable to peace.
In his recent audience with Meyer, tae
American Embassador, the Czar-indi
cated a willingness to take under ad
visement the subject of peace and ex
pressed a warm appreciation of the
friendly words of Meyer, speaking as
the personal envoys of the President.
The reception of Meyer was character
ized by the greatest cordiality and
friendliness, and the Ambassador's ca
blegram to the-Presldent, giving a gen
eral account of the audience, is of a
distinctively hopeful tone. Meyer did
not bring: to the St. Petersburg Gov
ernment an offer of mediation, but a
"friendly offer of good will." as It was
described by Count Cassinl, which ap
parently was gratifying to the Czar.
Further than this, it is impossible to
record the character of the cablegram.
Takahira, the Japanese Minister,
called by appointment at the White
House this afternoon and spent a half
hour with the President. He was Etill
unable to give the President the slight
est Indication regarding Japan's peace
terms, but it is believed he was ac
quainted In a general way with the
hopeful tone of Meyer's dispatch, and,
with this as a lever, the hope is ex
pressed here that he Mikado will meet
the President half way in the earnest
efforts he is making to assist in bring
ing about an early peace.

BERKELEY. " Jane 8. â Reports that
the PresSyfcrian synod of Northern
California was to Interfere in tbe se
lection of a pastor by parishioners of
the First Presbyterian Church ,of.
Berkeley were oCscialy denied to-day
by a <sOmirfttÂ»e reeeutly appointed to
arrange for the appearance of pastoral
candidates in "the church pulpit, the
corcralttee including J. -W. Richard,
president of the- University Saving's
Bank, and H. X. Baldtrio. ...-
Member* df the congregation have
been greatiy disquieted by the circa
lation v Etafements that, because of
the churebV failure -td - unite upon a
pastor, .he synod had asbed President
Mcln:oÂ«h of the San An?--iao Theolog
ical Seminary *to assist the Presbyteri^
ans here in setting. a suitable minis-*
ter. It ia to restore the peace of xnind
of the con =re nation that the official

isade to-day. * .. ... . , ..'
The situation of the First . Presbyte
rias "Church, fs regarded as peculiar.
the congregation having: been unable
to decide upon a minister, in spite of
persistent attempts to call various ntÂ«fn
to the pulpit. A. year ago the* 'Rs7.
E. W. r Work resigned the pastorate
here, and 'since then the pulpit has
been vacant, except for.tbe services of

Pain in the
Head
Is a danger signal, warniag
you that the brain nerves are
exhatistedâ irritated, and are
undergoing an unnatural strain.
Frequent and prolonged at-
tacks of pain "weaken: the gen-
erative power of the nerve*
cells bÂ£ the brain, and lead;to
loss of -'memory, melancholy,
spasms, epilepsy, and frequent-
ly insanity.
iWhen- the ; brain nerves are
weakened they, are unable to
supply sufficient nerve force
to the nerves that control the'
lungs, heart,- stomach and
other organs, and these organs
are thus robbed of energy, and*
unable to meet the demands
upon them.and they ' get sick.

SIOUX CITY. lowa, June S. â Because
the could not resist the temptation to
open letters written by the wife of C.
W. Coats, a business man, to two men,
both prominent in their sphere, Mrs.
Sadie P'ord. postmistress of Hill City,
S. D.. is under sentence for violation
of the postal laws. It was only through
the leniency of those with whose mail
she had tampered and through the in
tercession of Congressman E. W. Mar
tin of Deadwood that the Judge of the
Federal Court was induced to impose
the lightest possible sentence and to
suspend that.
"1 feared those letters wxjuld lead to
wrongdoing:, and might break up two
or throe homes." Mrs. Ford explained
on the witness stand in Deadwood. "and
I thought It my Christian duty as
postmistress to open them. But even
If I had not. surely the thought would
have occurred to me that the United
States would not wish to become a
party to a scandal. Nothing but cu
riosity? No, indeed.* I jus.t couldn't
bear the thought of the Coatses getting
info the divorce court./
Letters addressed to F. C. Crocker, a
mine owner, and C. E. McEachron, pro
l>roprietor of a department store, were
opened by Mrs. Ford repeatedly. They
bore an Omaha postmark, and, as Mrs.
Coats was visiting in Omaha, Mrs.
Ford scented scandal. She jumped at
the conclusion that bits of gossip she
had heard were well founded. After a
brief wrestling with her conscience she
opened the letters. Crocker and Mc-
Eachron confronted her with the
charge, and she dfd not deny it.
Had she stopped with her first of
fense, it would not have been so diffi
cult to adjust tne differences with Uncle
Sajn. but friends who championed her
cause were informed by a postoffiee in
spector that after opening the letters
first received from Mrs. Coats she care
fully resealed them and sent them to
Crocker and McEachron. They an
swered them and Mrs. Coats replied in
turn. The correspondence of the trio
was carried on for several weeks with
out suspicion being aroused.
But Mrs. Ford could not repress an
occasional "I told you so" to her neigh
bors, and so tr?2 story leaked out. -

later the celluloid cubes were merrily

before the cutting occurred. To the
policeman who arrested Mr. Perkins it
was positively stated by Mr. McClain*
that the carving was committed in

Clam arÂ»ived at the conclusion that he
had been mistaken as to the knife

TWO rather antagonistic relations between Russia and the
United States are believed to exist. The official organ in St.
Petersburg denounces President Roosevelt for interning the
Russian warships at Manila, and the Czar chooses- the President
as the medium through which to get Japan's views as to a settle
ment. In interning the Russian ships 'President Roosevelt has
international law and the rules of neutrality on his side. The ship
of a belligerent, driven into a neutral- port- by storm -and stress,
has the right to make herself 'seaworthy before departure. But she
has no right to rush out of battle into a\ neutral port and there re
pair the injuries of war. To admit this would be to make every
neutral port a naval base for belligerents. The St. Petersburg paper
ip simply uttering its anger and does not speak in terms of proper
construction of international law.
There seems no doubt that the war party among the Grand
Dukes is losing its influence with the Czar. His uncle, the grim and
savage Vladimir, has deserted it and wants peace, and so does
Alexiefl, who is more responsible for. the war than any one else.
While these rumors of. peace are flying around the. world, the Rus
sian army in Manchuria is preparing for "battle with- the -forces of
<*)yama, Kuroki and Nogi. 'If an inquiry as to terms be' made
through President Roosevelt Japan will no doubt reply that Russia
must first ask a truce and observe it This can be followed by pour
parlers that may end in a protocol, and that in a treaty to be made
by commissioners. The President is an intermediary, for the pur
pose of enabling the contestants to take the first step. The-method
adopted means that the settlement will be between Russia and
Japan solely, and that there will be no intrusion by, other- nations
such as cheated Japan at the close of her war with China.
PEACE, PERHAPS.
T was to be expected that the discovery of great bodies of petro
leum in California would lead to an attempt to control the out
put by the Standard Oil Company. That trust is the largest
<kaier in oil in the world, and immediately turns its attention to, the
control of every new source of supply, lest its monopoly be broken
by competition. In one way and anotlier, some said to be devious
and indirect, the Standard has monopolized the oil of California.
The significance of this to the consumer may be estimated
when it is known that this State is the largest oil producer in the
world except Russia. We produced in 1903, the latest statistics
available, 24,340,839 barrels of petroleum, valued at $7,313,271. In
the order of quantity produced the oil counties are. Kern, Fresno,
Los Angeles, Orange, Ventura, Santa Barbara and Santa Clara.
The Standard secured control of the Kern County district, produc
ing over 18,000,000 barrels, but the Coalinga Wells in Fresno Coun
ty, with a product of over 2,000,000 barrels, maintained independence
by the building of a pipe line to Monterey owned by the Coalinga
Oil and Transportation Company. This concern was able to com
pete, and its existence would naturally mean the extension of 'its
operation to new fields if such were discovered in its territory.
The first lesson learned by Mr. Rockefeller in the evolution of
the Standard Oil trust was that whoever has unrestrained control,
of transportation has absolute control of production. The Coalinga
Company took this lesson from him and built its profitable pipe line
to Monterey. Then appeared the other card in Mr. Rockefeller's
hand, which he has played so often, and which has seldom failed to
take the trick. He threatened to put a pipe line to Monterey from
the Kern County field and use it to crush Coalinga competition by
reducing rates. It was plain that he could do this easily. His pipe
from the field on Kern River runs through Fresno County, and a
branch not much longer than the Coalinga line would put his oil
into Monterey.
It is said that in working this scheme he has the assistance
of the Southern Pacific railway. This is probable, for his immense
resources enable him to subject railroads to his will. Any way,
whether in alliance with the railroad, or alone, his threat has ac
complished its purpose and the stock of the Coalinga Company is in
escrow, under an option of sale that matures in a few weeks. When
this is accomplished it* is the end of independence in the oil fields.
One needs only to visit the producers in Kern County to be im
pressed by the blight that has* fallen upon them and the ruin of their
fortunes that has come through this monopoly of transportation.
The Standard has the producer and the consumer by the throat and
can do as it pleases with both.
The matter affects California more profoundly than anything
else in our local economy. Crude oil is in universal use as a sub
stitute for steam coal. Power jn all of our cities depends upon it.
The vast pumping plants on the reclaimed delta lands of the Sac
ramento and San Joaquin are built and adjusted to its use. In the
middle and upper stretches of the San Joaquin Valley, where rfon
flovving artesian wells offer abundant water for irrigation by pump
ing, the gas engine distillates of petroleum are used on thousands ;
of pumping plants which cannot be run without them. \ These
plants irrigate tens of thousands of acres and make them product
ive. So we have involved in the oil question, as far as it relates to
our rural industries, the great industries of drainage and .irrigation.
Beyond that are the interests of the manufacturers of pumps t ancl.
engines that depend upon the use of the oil and its distillates. In'
these rural industries that depend upon the use of power the margin
is so narrovv between .the possible and impossible that the control of
the oil ma}' bring it to a balance which means misery or to an over
balance which means ruin over an immense area of land that is
now producing. The population on that area . will hear of the
monopoly with the keenest apprehension and discontent.
Perhaps there is no present remedy. But one way appears in
the future. This transaction is so clearly a matter of transportation
that it will bring into focus the question of the legal status of an
oil pipe line. Stages and steamboats were common carriers. .When
they were substituted by the railroad no statute was required to
make of it a common carrier. It was such in the nature of things.
Now in respect to the transportation of oil, a substance of prime
necessity in our industriaf^scheme, the pipe line in its turn is a sub-,
stitute for the railroad. Is it not, by parity of reasoning, a common
carrier?
At one end of the stage route, the steamboat and rail routes
were the producers, at the other the consumers. In the same rela
tive position are the same parties at the termini of the pipe line.
It has every legal and, economic feature of a common carrier.. If it
be such, every oil producer can deliver to it his oil freight at the
intake and receive an equivalent quantity at the delivery outlet.
The rate of transportation charged to him will be under public su
pervision and regulation and that rate must; be equal in all cases.
This matter is of such transcendent importance to California
that it cannot rest where this last deal puts it. The people will de
mand an adjustment that, will take their large group of interests
out of the hands of a monopoly. We have no war to wage against
business combinations, but we do insist that they be compelled by
law to conform their policy to the interests of the public, which
far outweigh the interests of the fevy individuals who seek profit by
monopoly. ..-\u25a0-. .

send out experts to Cornwall,' where
radium has been found, as the supply
of the wonderful substance, which is
daily finding: new uses, is . practically
exhausted in; Englandâ while Austria,
the only country where radium is found
in quantities, has forbidden tho export
of it. An ounce of radium is at present
worth 5900,000. â¢
"Radium is almost priceless . how,"
said Sir William, "for the simple reason
i At present the. radium clock is made
in two forms, one for the magic lantern,
the other for the lecture desk to demon
strate the peculiar powers of radium.
A considerable number of these clocks
have already been sold and Mr. Martin
dale is confident that radium will soon
have an extended commercial use.

â¢ The great event *of the Florence Rob
erts season at the California Theater
up to date is the production of Vic
torlen Sardou's; wonderful play, "La
Tosca," announced for the week com
mencing Sunday "night, with matinees
on "Wednesday and Saturday.' "La
Tosca" is- one 1 at the 'classics of "the
stage and one of the- severest tests of
the powers of a female star." .Florence
Roberts is an exceedingly gifted wom
an and ought to make a notable'Tosca
because she is full of latent ' force,
strong emotional quality and has.' 'a
keen and delicious sense of comedy.
â¢ The character |of La " Tosca ' is all
comedy and coquetry at first, and that
is where most of Miss Roberts' prede
cessors'have lacked in the role. They
have nearly ; all been of the trage
dienne type and lacked the volatile dis
position of which La Tosca was full.
Before being aroused she was an rn
genuous character, with all the fas-;
cinations of a . beautiful and gifted
woman with an absorbing passion foT
her artist lover. Afterward, however,
her fury is all powerful and brings out
the tragic strength of the player. Miss
Roberts has every essential for - the
character, in temperament and .talent
and ought to achieve the success of her
career on Sunday night.
The cast will be especially strong, !
and Herschel Mayall will appear, as Le
Baron Scarpia, \( the Regent of Poflce,
and Lucius Henderson as the artist,
Mario Carvarodossi.
. The scenic effects will be exception
ally handsome, notably', the scenes
showing the Church of St. Andrea; at
Rome, the Fames Palace, Scarpia's
room in the castle of St.' Angelo and
the ramparts of St. Angelo, overlook
ing Rome and the Tiber.

The bids for the building of six ad

plans will have to be modified, as the
Supervisors say they have no funds
with which to make up the difference.

homegoers. The entertainers had evi

play wine* had flowed bountifully, and by
the time the two ."were ready to hail the
car at the- Mason street crossing they
were ; totally oblivious to any but their

drowsy helpmate. "Thash ; the sun.

; The audience gasped. "Grapes,;' said a
wise one. \u25a0 ."v." '//
By this, time. the gaze of the masculine
section of the duo had become fixed on

beamed with 'the brilliance of his as yet

on his willing shoulder. '"Dearie,"'he gen

You know any one in perfect health never "feels" at the stom-
ach; it's forgotten like any other part of a perfect running ma-
chine. No jar, no shock, no sensations at all; just easy, pleasant,
lies in tne proper selection of food and drink, gettinj? down to
Nature's principles, plenty of good air, good water, and particu-
larly plenty of good food that will easily digest, and nourish and
rebuild, pot clog up.

elements it required to rebuild itself, used this knowledge in : a

Then, again, . in Grape-Nuts the starchy part of the "Wheat and

Upon the presentation of the cup the
volume of cheering and general joli.Â»;
cation threatened to jar the foundation
of the building. Following this' ex
pression of enthusiasm.- Mr. ,Boobar of
the Academic' Atnletic- League congrat
ulated the team and the students. Mr.
Mikel, chairman of the committee on
baseball of the Academic "Athletic
League, responded to the call for a
speech, and in a few words outlined- the
policy of the athletic association.
Those of the student body who spoke
were Freeman W: Bowley, yell leader;
George White, captain of the winning
baseball team; Henry Snell, manager of
baseball and football teams; Herbert S.
Johns, captain of the . championship
track team; Walter Heitmuller, cap
tain-elect of the track squad; Marlus
Hotchklss, captain of the victorious
football team, and Donald Day, leader
of tne champion swimmers. These
youths, all leaders of some victorious
squad, responded either to the future
prospects of the black and gold or
dwelt upon the trials and triumphs of
the present and past years. .
George White, the speedy pitcher,
spoke of the hard struggle of the base*
ball teams of previous seasons," how
they won the highest honors In the
semi-finals only to lack the little to
turn out winners. In his .estimation
the- baseball career of Lick was still
in its infancy, and that the cup, which
has to be won three times, could be
called the property of the Lick School.
The track victories .of the Lick
School have been of "a 'nature unheard
of before. Lick has .in the "last year
and a half won seven field days out of
a possible nine.
George A. Merrill, In the name of the
team, student body and faculty, accept
ed the trophy and" in a clear-cut speech
expressed his stand on the subject of
athletics.-" -' . "' " ' "â¢. 5
Great was the jubilation yesterday at
the Uck School. Cheers followed con
gratulatory speeches and the rooters
made the walls ring with their cries.
Sparkling: before the eyes of the stu
dents, the alumni and the faculty stood
a trophy, won by pluck and prized ac
cordingly. A cup of silver inscribed,
"Won by LJck. 1905," was the object,
and It signified the Academic Athletic
League baseball championship.
All l.'.rk was there, and all Lick was
happy and exultant. President Scaife
of the Academic Athletic League,
in presenting the prize to â¢ the
winners, stated it gave * him great
pleasure to bestow the cup upon
the Lsck School, as by a plucky
and square uphill light they haM estab
lished a record for other schools to
live up to. Mr. Scaife went on to. say
that in his estimation the athletics of
a school were its life, and one of the
benefits to be derived from such an ed
ucation. Athletics are to be for all
equally and all should derive equally of
the enjoyments.

SUMMARY.
XaiwwSy cut In with a.ny speeches or
Â«Â£sHb j-BsterdJor at Kecreation Park and
jawbsir tried to stop the game either
itISS TtsrJia 'Wlleon alaniraÂ«d tnroHga
wSd a. twtt-cnshlon swipe In the tenth.
His effort was prompted bx *\u25a0 nobJe
lÂ«aÂ»flTe cad It wea the gr&ma tor thÂ«
6Â«Â£ls by bringing Joe ICealan ail the
way hers o from first.
Every cos era the fleJd "Â«ras -well be
hETed isi QisJeX *nd noziixas but basl
seu iru ior them. Old Slat Davis w*s
'the ori>sr Â£2>oxit kid Â£.nd he had tbejn
mil mtepj&ag en their feet ia order to
graft *racnd llTely. They reeled off alsc
fn an hour and tUxteca n~iln
â¢utes and it only took: seven more to
a?eaJc up it c sÂ«sae.
Tie jComnmtern never h&d a license
to Jay any cJÂ«<r" to a run. Hen
ley h&A ererx one of them on his staff
and tbey could not &et <on those sacJu
at &ZL Besides shooting up the proper
kind of dope in his headers. Hen
ley vtcffsd I^nleavy, Francks and
Krc^er oS the bags. I>nn fell mt sec
ond, whiie Francks and Kruger sot
theirs at first.
With one cone in the tenth. Joe Xea
lan ripped off one to left that barely >
got a*pray from Fxanclts. Parke Wilson
â¢OttSad the first bail pitched out to left
field. It etruek right along the line
and kept breaking away from Dun
lea vy ail the time. Xeolon hotfooted
to the pan and beat the relay throw josr
abont enough to give the umpire a li
cense to yell -"Safe."' though Jimmy
Byrnes thought differently.
The Seals might have grabbed one in
the ninth, but "W'aldron's bad judgment
put the Queer on it. "Wally started it
off with a double over first base and
"Wheeler sacrificed. Hildebrand chopped
one at Francks, who threw WaJdron
out at the pan by many feet. He did
not have a chance to make the play, but
started as the ball was hiL
The Trork of both infields was fast
and right up to the limit. Gochnauer
pulled off a few plays that made the
fans howl, \u25a0while Francks was also
there with some himself. Both catch
ers pegged as they never pegged before
and not a man got away with a stolen
base.
Old Doc is back at his post and
rhases the balls faster than ever be
fore. Doc says he will never go on a
strike again and promises to stick this
time till the leagrue breaks up. The
score:

SEATTLE, June B.â Fair weather
brought out the best crowd sinc^ Decora-
I tlon day at The Meadows this Afternoon.
The defeat of two odds-on favorites. In
terlude and Joe Frey, were the sensations
of the day. In the four and a half fur
longs Interlude was badly bothered from
the start. Last away the horse was in
| second place at the three-quarters post,
but could not better his position, finishing
one and a half lengths behind Charles
Lamar.
With Frey It was different. He opened
at 3 to 5 and went to 2 to S. Third away
from the stand which one of three horses
being badly ridden by Hoaman and the
impression prevailed that the Jockey did
not want to finish in the money.
In the mile race it_was impossible to tell
from the stand wftfen one of three horse*
won. Judge Egbert rang up Golden Ivy.
â¢Canejo and Eleven Bells. For the last

CONSIDERS AN" AMENDMENT
TO BUILDING ORDINANCE
Supervisors* Fire Committee Takes Up
Proposition to Extend Distance
Betweea Hrlck Wall*.
The Supervisors' Fire Committee yester
day considered a. proposed amendment to the
building ordinance permitting the distance be
tween the brick walls of a building to be
137 .4 feet instead ot ICO feet, as at present.
The committee ascertained , that the Fire De
partment of flcials considered the â¢ amendment
objectionable from a nre point of view and
postponed action on the matter ror two weeks,
when Chief Engineer Sullivan. Fire Marshal
TowÂ» ami City Architect Shea will be present
to give - their views -on the amendment. The
committee also postponed action for one week
on the petition of August Raynaud for a per
mit to operate an engine and boiler In a laun
dry on H street, between Ninth and Tenth
avenues, fearing triat the residents In the
vicinity misrht object. . A petition, however,
was subsequently filed by Emma Harrington
and other property owners that the petition be
granted.- . *
Manager Morris Levy is still waiting
to sisn a couple of fighters to mix it at
the Hayes Valley Club show during
July. Pie says he wants to see Brltt
and Kid Sullivan put up their dukes,
\u25a0 but he has 'not yet given the 'anxious
Mr. Herford of Baltimore his answer.
Herford wired yesterday, stating he
wanted to know immediately, as he had
an offer to take his charge to Butte for
a meeting- with Herrera on July 4.
Jimmy Britt is anxious to get on
with Sullivan, as is also Brother "Willis.
They would sign up right away in a
hurry, but" Levy sees no object in rush-
In?? the thing along. Britt received an
offer yesterday to meet Herrera on the
same day Sullivan was to meet the
Mexican and in the same town. Willis
has no longing to take another trio to
Montana. His memory is still fresh,
and he has not forgotten what hap
pened there a couple of years ago,
when he Jqurneyed In company wltu
Jimmy to Butte, but did not even get a
meal ticket.
Dick Hyland was on the line- last
night with a challenge for Eddie Han
lon. Hyland wants to meet. Eddie, at
any old weight, and before any old
club, at any old time. Eddie says he
would be willing to take Hyland to
some, secluded spot and there teach
him a couple of things about the manly
art. Eddie is going to the country for
a rest within the next few days.
Britt and Kreling leave to-day for
their walk Into the Tosemlte.
Tbe San Francisco Special Messenger Service
yesterday petitioned the Supervisors* Elec?
trtcity Committee for permission to continue
operating the messenger service now conducted
over wires on Glasgow, Eddy. Ellis and Mar
ket streets. The copartnership of the concern
has been increased by the addition oÂ£ two /"
members, and the committee directed It to
file affidavits to that effect. The commutes
reminded the representatives of the company
that all wires must be put underground by ne.xr
Hay and that no new overhead wire* may bs
Installed.
Would Continue Messenger Service.

sociation adopted a' resolution /to-day
fa vpringr -reciprocity " treaties with the
principal European nation^ and'provid
ing: for- the appointment of ' a committee
to urge Congress to adopt them and to
solicit the? Co-ope ration of ot^er commer
cial bodies in the movement. . *
â¢A resolution was also adopted declaring
tliat "as the present foreism outlet for
American manufactures, particularly cot
ten goods and the market which prom
ises an Immense expansion In the near
future is China, ft Is the sense of this as
sociation that existing laws of the United
States excluding Chinese subjects; to a
class whose immfsration Is not subject
ed to restriction by the terms of the
treaty are harsh, unreasonable, wrong
fully invioJative of the sacred obliga
tions cf a treaty, and are detrimental to
thft^btst Interests of the people of the
United States and that this association
therefore earnestly urges upon Congress
their repeal and recommends the nego
tiation of a new treaty with China which
while providing for the proper regulation
of undesirable' Chinese immigration,' shall
likewise permit freedom of entry and of
domicile upon the part of the Chinese not
of the laboring class and with whom the
maintenance of- friendly relations is of
prime importance to the development of
the business interests of this country."

N'EVi" TORK. June 8. â Tnere was an abor
tive efTort to Â»tir up activity en the stock mar
koi in the first hours of to-cay'Â« eenEion, which
resulted in lifting a few stocks to a ccnsHer
ab!y higher level than yesterday's closing.
The movement fl&tUntai out completely and
the subsequent Bett'.ir.g of prices to a lower
basis vac due as much to Inanition In tbe
market as to any active preÃÂ»ure to cell. The
oi>en!ng advance had its incentive in the higher
lex-el for Loncon prices, based on the belief in
a hopeful outlock for peace. Although the
prospect for peace is attributed to the Initia
tive of the American Government, the interest
rr.ani fested in the matter by the etock market
is of the most languid character. The uplift
of prices was purely eyrapatbetic with London,
an 3 the actual transactions for foreign account
l*er. v.-ere insisr.lncant in amount. The 6mall
â¢ejiing attracted by the higher range of prices,
however, invited seme additional attempt .to
move the market upward. The effort* centered
en & handful of stocks among the coalers and
Southern railway! snd Including Amalgamated
Ocpper. The operations In tne Southern group
were attributed to a newry ronned pool or a
irvival of aa old pool. Very favorable show
ings cf $rosÂ« earning* being made by railroads
in that region were* made the basis of the
rnovernr-r.t. The large procuction of anthracite
is a favxraMe factor for the coalers. The
movements attracted no lmixirtant following.
Very favorable conditions In tne growing crops
v*r* rerwrted, but a sufficient period of un
cÂ«*rta!nty remains before the narvest to prompt
a dc-'.ay'in r'cnnlng definite cendosions on the
outcome. Trie inertia of the United State*
Fteel mock* was almost complete. Influenced
by the absence cf any indications of revived
activity in the iron mantcts. This proved a
burdfn on eentiment toward the whole market.
The slow flgbt â¢which is being dragged out in
the Equitable Life still exercises a repreerlve
influence en the stock marxet and causes a
dread cf possible unfavorable results of a far
reaching character In the investment demand
for aecurlties in the future. The rise In call
money rates was attributed to the redistribu
tion of funds on deposit, which ere the proceeds
cf the Japanese loan subscription among vari
ous Cnarrial Institution*, and the Intimation
v:b.* conveyed that theÂ«e funds are likely to be
left on deposit here for an indefinite period.
Discount rates declined In London, and foreign
banking houses were reported as placing loans
in this market. Stock commission houses also
have funds to lend, owing to the extreme dull
ness of the stock market. The hardening of
the call money rate was rerarded as purely
temporary. Only a remnant of the day's gains
*-as preserved and the average level of prices
â¢was Insignificantly changed rrcm last night.
The peace rumors nutde tr.e Japanese bones
strong. The l>cr.d market generally wae dull
end eteaiy. Total sales, par value, 13.730.000.
United States 3s registered advanced \i per
cent on call.

doing, especially in tbe real estate field and
hi a few of the minor manufacturing indus
tries, but nothing to casse general uneasiness.
So far as the etock market is concerned the
failures which occurred in May have elim
insted weak epots and Imposed a test upon
values which should offer a basis for at least
a partial revival of confidence. It Is true
that the big holder* have sold many stocks

it ea*j- and will probably co remain until,
the autumn demands for crops begin. Bank
rvaerves should continue to rise and gold ex

course of our International trade balance. The

The charge of E. Clemens Horst. that the

returned false weights on grain placed by him

Straits of Carqulnez was" substantiated yester
day when a Jury In Judge-. Kerrigan's court
returnvd a verdict against the * corporations
narhed and In, favor -of \u25a0 Horst -for $1771 87.
In answer to the charge- that-" they had
returned false weights the companies set up
the claim that the apparent shortage. had been
caused by screening the grain for .the purpose
of cleaning it. i Horst answered this, defense by
alleging that if the grain hnd been screened
the screenings were of value, .but that no re
turn -of the same had been: inadi. to, him. and
further if this wÂ«re true the loss of the grain
would not.be so great as the returns showed,

'â¢Such conduct on the part of a man handling

Kindler has an invention which enables
his craft to avoid the. 'dangers usually, en^
countered by airship exploiters." This Is
a device for throwing; heated air. into the
balloon so that it will rise of Itself. above
a possible storm.. Ordinarily It will' be
propelled upward by ; the motor. The
regular gear only steers the craft in" a
horizontal direction, but by means. of a
shifting weight on the bottom of the car
the balloons are pointed vertically -and
the cars follow. - â¢
There are three coaches attached to the
balloons. One of these will . contain the
machinery. The foremost one .will be
used â¢to run the steering -wheel and for
the carrying of, supplies. The center car
is to be the one for passengers. It. will
be fitted up like . v a\u0094 palatial; car. There
rvill be j beds,' a dining-room and 'a ' gal
lery. Connecting the cars is a long prom
enade walk giving the bccupantÃ ample
room to move around. )â¢; r .-: Â»
The total weight of the new airship will
be 6000 pounds. The balloons will ; carry
21,000 yards of silk. ThÂ« i inventor , claims
to', be backed by .several ., capitalists' in
San Francisco and in - Germany. ; He ; fig
ures that the total cost"Tof the machine
will be \u25a0 v â¢ â¢ \u25a0
There Is also a safety appliance. so -that
In case the machinery, suddenly to
work or one of the balloons becomes rent
the car will not dash to the ground, vAn
aeroplane is attached to the ship capa
ble in size of supporting the craft and
6000 pounds freight, jj This plane will hold
the vessel poised In the air and the oper
ator can lower it tenderly toithe ground;
In case the enemy should be below there
is no necessity of descending, and r the
machine will remain stationary for- two
weeks.
HAS SAFETY APPLIANCE.
The new airship will be propelled by a
gasoline engine of 300 horsepower and
will be able to travel in a windstorm.
It carries Its own fuel and. gas enough
to run for two months. The machinery
will be made in Germany. There will.be
three propellers. The gas Is to be manu
factured out of a new -process of filtra
tion. It Is run through water, thus puri
fying it. This purifying process keeps
the- interior of the balloons from becom
ing coated with the refuse from the gas.
The ideas which Kindler t has -put Into
the, plans for^ the real air ship are new.
Instead of the old rudder steering gear^
this machine is to be pointed by means of
the front balloon, which works on a pivot.
This balloon is encased in an aluminum
covering and the whole fastened to a steel
spar. This spar is moved by a wheel as
on a salline- vessel and ' it is so con
structed that it, can be moved no matter
how great a gale of wind is blowing.. The
other . balloon â¢is stationary and : carries
most of the weight of the vessel.
The plan of the Inventor Is to make
this niaiifllne a ..; weriptiii tit warfare.
Kindler says that he will be able' to
drop a bomb from a height of 5000 feet
into a space half the size, of a battle
ship. The machine will make seventy
five miles on hour. \u25a0 \u25a0
>OVEL STEERING GEAR.
E. A. Kindler oÂ« 1524; O'Farr'ell \u25a0treet
baa invented on nirwhip which, if the
Inventor's .' expectations are realized,
Tvill revolutionize the modern method of
warfare. With this machine it will be
possible for a single man to travel In
an air ear and drop death-dealing? mis
siles upon an army. The' inventor made
the first trinl with n model at Glen Park
yesterday afternoon frith success. . The
demonstration was carried on inside the
pavilion becaqse the experimental ship
was too light to weather â¢ the strong:
wind that 'was blowing; outside. . â¢
The iriveritor of this train, for there are
three cars attached to the balloons, Is a
German. His first success came last year
in Denver, when he made a demonstration
of a model ship. Colorado promised to
send him to St. Louis, where .he could
vie with, the heralded Baldwin., But for
tune was not to be his for long. Before
his start was undertaken a fire destroyed
the creature of his bands. Kindler then
came to San Francisco, and yesterday's
trial marked the completion of his year's
work. Yet it showed all' of 'the clever
mechanism, in the development of which
the man had given his whole j min,^. ... It
was thirty feet long and. weighed twenty-,
one pounds. At that it carried morethart
its own weight. The power .was .fur
nished hy an electric battery.''.

"Arnold" Ribbed Knit
Umbrella Drawers.
The ideal garment for travel-
ers.
Don't go to the mountains or
seashore without two or more
pairs of these delightfully cool
garments in your trunk. They re-
quire but the ruffle laundered, and
can be rolled up, occcupying litfle
space. The knit cotton fabric is
cellularly porous and highly ab-
sorbent, to which its non-adhesi\'e
qualities are due, and at the same
time overcomes that "damp" and
chilly sensation which accompa-
nies woven materials when worn
next to the skin. #
The ruffle, when laundered,
causes the fabric to stand away
from the body, hence a perfect
circulation of air is obtained, mak-
ing it the coolest garment ever
devised for summer use.
There are three . styles, French
band, button band and jersey top,
and four sizes, according - to
lengthâ 23, 25, 27 and 29 inch.
