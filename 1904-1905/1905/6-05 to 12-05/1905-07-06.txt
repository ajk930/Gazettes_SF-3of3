* FORT WORTH. Tex., July 5.â A tor
nado, which struck Texas in the upper
edge of Montague County, coming from
tlie northeast and swinging far to the
eoutheast this afternoon, caused the
loss, it is believed, of sixty lives, in
jured v. large number of people and did
untold damage to growing crops and
cattle.
Fortunately the tornado missed the
small towns in the section through
\u25a0which it swept, but It zigzagged in
such a. way as to take in the homes of
many farmers and stock raisers in the
-â¢"oijpn. - , - ....... - â--.-
At JJigksboro fue force of -the * wind
was terrlnc. -"The Baptist church and"
twenty other buildings were blown off
taeir foundations and a number of
buildings totally destroyed.
Mrs. Travis Calhoun was seriously in
jured. Travis Calhoun. Mrs. Thomas
Horton and Henry Wesser and family
were also injured.
At Montague no lives were lost in the
town, but in the country great loss of
life is reported. The wires are down in
all directions and It Is difficult to get
particulars. Ten persons are known to
be dead In the neighborhood of Mon
tague. Most of the killed lived on Salt
Creek, along which the tornado swept
with special force.
At Nocona the tornado passed a few
miles to the south, where â¢it killed four
teen persons. A reliable man at Nocona,
who has been over the scene, saya that
reports were being received of the dead
when he left there and he places the
loss of life at sixty.
Owing to the widely separated homes
and the fact that in many instances whole
families were wiped out details and
names are difficult to secure.

ASBURV PARK, X. J., July 5. San
Francisco wins the honor of entertnln
lukt the "schoolntariuV* inrtJ occasional
\u25a0cholmasters next year. Her delegates
came like Hie Greeks, brnrlns kIKs,
such as tlie Golden Gate knows hovr to
offer, and the trustees irerÂ« overcome.
The claims of Chicago, Atlanta, St.
Louis, Denver and Minneapolis were
sidetracked.
The. chairman of the California dele
gation,. Professor "Alexander '.Holmes
McQanald, . offered everything- the com
mittee demanded .and anything:; else It
could- think^uif.bttwlxt; this-, andinext
June/" He <-brought 'along Â«"a? carload' of
gorgeous silken yeilow > poppies,. the
State's , floral i emblem, which -Mrs/iMc-
Donald pinned. upon the, breasts of all
the women and stuck In the coats of
all the men. There are apparent to the
eye no delegates save those from the
Occident, a master stroke of diplomacy.
While these floral seductions were be-
In? resorted to. Professor W. H. Lang
don. City Superintendent of Schools of
San Francisco, concluded his heavy ar
guments and California won.
Electioneering was resumed v to-day.
"When Dr. Thompson,, president of the
University of Ohio, arrived In Ashbury
Park this morning he read in the news
papers that Professor Charles D. Mclvbr
of Greensborough,'N..a, had him beaten
for president of the association. He
straightway withdrew from the race, but
requested all his friends to support
Nathan' C. Shaefer of Harrlsburg, Pa,,
the vice president of the national council.
Tuesday at midnight Professor Mclvor
had pledged a, majority, of the directors.
Nothing daunted, the friends of Thomp
son and Shaefer set to work this morning
to undermine Mclvor and for a time it
looked sultry for the South, which for
twenty years has not been honored by the
presidency of the association. As night
drew on, the Mclvor forces announced
confidently that their man had retained
substantially his majority. .*
Never within the history of the associ
ation has practical politics played so
prominent a part as at this convention.
It is the West against the South. The
North and East are out of the running.
Uy many the fact that San Francisco
won the next convention is regarded as
an additional " reason' for Professor Mc-
Ivor's victory. Professor James .W.
Crabtree of Peru, Neb., declined this
afternoon to accept the treasureshlp for
another term and Dr.. John N. Wilkin
son of Emporla, Karis., was slated for
his place. The re-election of Professor
R. Irwln Shepard of Wlnona, Minn., to
the secretaryship Is assured, there being
no competitor - for the office.

THEODOSIA, Crimea, July 5--The mutineers qf the KniazPotem
kine to-day formally raised the standard of rebellion and issued the
following declaration : - :^" i
"The crew of the Kniaz Potemkine notify the foreign powers that
the decisive struggle has been begun against the Russian government.
We consider it to be our duty to declare that we guarantee the complete
inviolability of foreign ships navigating the Black Sea, as well as the
inviolability of foreign ports." . .-- /. fe-
ST. PETERSBURG. July 6, 2:10 a. m.-
The Admiralty has received news that
the Kniaz Potemkine, after shipping coal,
Frcvisions and medical supplies. Is again
at large in the Black Sea and that her
destination is unknown.
The crew took a remarkable step yes
terday when, with all the solemnity of
â¢ 4 .provisional government, it issued a
..manifesto addressed to the powers, an
. bouncing that civil war had been bfgun
*â¢ against the existing regime In Russia.
and pledging the inviolability of foreign
â¢hipping and foreign ports.
* This action doubtless was taken to quiet
the apprehensions of foreign powers 4n<l
â¢â¢ to leave no excuse for the sending of
. warships through the Dardanelles to ef
,fect the capture of the battleship, which
.â¢"until now Russia's Black Sea fleet has
\u0084' not -dared to attempt. It is considered
. a shrewd move on the part of the muti
\ neers .and stamps the commandtr or trie
â¢ crow as a leader far above the class of
th# ordinary sailor and strengthens the
â¢ tpinion that he is not a member of the
original crew, but one of the revolu
tionaries who went on board at Odessa.
â¢ j " The issuance of the manifesto lends a
'certain dignity to the mutiny and proves
iJiat the crew and their commander have
no desire that the world should believe
them to be mere outlaws, but that they
should be looKed upon as men seriously |
raising the standard of revolution. *
Nothing has been received to confirm
the supposition that the request for a
doctor at Theodosia indicated a struggle
'for supremacy on the way from Kustenjl.
* According to a rumor printed in an
afternoon paper the ship's strong box
contained J275.000 and the mutineers,
therefore, would be well supplied with
* mdiv jr. ' ' : '_ - '
.In circles clcsely in touch with the
, revolutionists It Is regarded as a fore
gene conclusion that the commander of
the Kniat Potemkine, knowing the situ
ation in the Caucufius. will head for Poti
or Batoum, where the revolutionists are
exceedingly strong, in the hope of pro
<juf-:ng a general rising- With the au
, thorities In the Caucusus almost power
less to prevent it. such a contingency is
by no means impossible.
* Dispatches from Tlflls, received I last
night, say that reports of rioting at
Odessa and the action of the Knlaz
- Potemkine have aroused the most intense
. Interest and the wildest joy among the
"revolutionists. The receipt of the reports
\u25a0uas followed, immediately by a complete
strike, even' the lamplighters quitting
work. The city ie in darkness and the
'â¢inhabitants generally are fleeing to the
northward. *
'The Emperor Nicholas 11. the crew of
"which is reported to have mutinied at
Constantinople, is a Russian merchant
man.-\u25a0'â¢*.-'*Â«
Considerable anxiety is felt because the
* cruiser Chernomoretz, which was due at
"Sfcb&stopol to-day, has not yet arrived.
Order has not been restored at Bielo
* etok. A censored telegram received last
night reported that shooting had been
* heard, that crowds were fleeing and that
wild excitement prevailed, but no details
were given.
MUTINEERS OBTAIN FOOD.
I Tbrrat to Bombard Tbeodosla Has the
*, , . Desired Effect.
: THEODOSIA, July 5. â The Russian
battleship Kniaz Potcinkine to-day.ar
rived here and asked for provisions,
medicines, coal. etc. The mutineers de
manded that the authorities guarantee
their safety during the stay of the ship
here.
Summoned by the Knlaz Potemkine,
representatives of the Town Council
went on board tbe battleship and were
received iri the admiral's cabin by the
commission commanding her. The com
mission demanded the delivery of 500
tons of coal and provisions of various
kinds within twenty-four hours and
threatened that In the event of non- |
compliance, after a warning to the ln
habltahts. the town would be bom
barded. The commission also proposed
that the Mayor should transmit to the
population a proclamation demanding ;
Use termination of the war. a convoca- i
tion of Zcrastvos, etc.
I^earning of these demands, many in- :
'habitants fled the town. The workmen
Insisted that the demands be granted.
A special meeting of the Municipal
Council was called and the Council con
sented, to deliver the provisions, but
refused to comply with the demand for
coal. for the reason that the town had
none.
BLACK SEA SQUADUOX SAII^S.
$>ald to Have Gone In Qurxt of the
Mutineer Battleship.
L.OXDON, July, 6. â It is understood
that the movements of the Kniaz Po
temkine are engaging the serious at
tention 'of the powers, which are ex
changing views on the possible neces
sity of taking Joint measures to pro
tcrt neutral commerce on the Black
Sea. According to a dispatch from Vi
enna, however,- nothing will be done
even in the shape of joint representa
tions to the Russian Government, ex
cept in the' last extremity, it being de
sired.to avoid wounding Russia's sus
ceptibilities.
Special dispatches from Constanti
nople give an 'unconfirmed repori;'that
the Knlaz Potemkine engaged \u25a0 two
British:. officers at Kustenjl.
According to a dispatch to tho. Stan

Standard asserts that* the'- .Black - Sea

COSSACKS FIRE IXTO CROWDS.
V.nnton . Slaughter Occura on the Har-
bor Front of Odessa.
ODESSA, July b: â Hie mutinous bat
tleship Kniaz PotemKine scouring ' thj
Black Sea strikes more terror to Ode6
fca's citizens than when she lay in this
harbor. Then they knew where ' the
rebel was, at least. Now her absence,
her flight here and there, provokes fears
that are augmented by wild rumors.
These fears are well founded, for the
mutineers on the Potemkine are in d>re
straits, lacking coal - and provisions.
Trie greater the mutineers' desperation,
the more danger to the city. The' mu
tineers' lives are doubly forfeit. The
charge of murdering their officers alone
would necessitate their extradition from
any port. Their only apparent chance
to escape as long as the other vessels
of the Black Sea tieet remain loyal is to
demand lenient treatment, perhaps full
pardon, under the threat or alternative
of destroying this or some other city on
the Black Sea coast. Besides, unless
they are starving, the rebels can hold,
up all Russian shipping/on Uie Black
Sea. Communication between Odessa
and the ports of the Caucasus is still
suspended. Sixty-seven \u25a0 of the muti
neers from the Georgi ' Pobiedonosetz,
Including the ringleaders, were impris
oned to-day. It is expected that all
will be shot.
The Georgi Pobiedonosetz was
aground in the harbor last night. Ad^
miral Kruger sent two tugs to pull her
off, not wishing to put another warship
under the mutineers' guns, 4 ' The \ tugs
succeeded in pulling off the" Georgi Po
biedonosetz, and, ,â convoyed j by_ three
warships, she sailed for SebastopoL
Tormented by fears, several thousand
persons crowded. the heights at Cape
Fontaine last night and to-day, /and
from that vantage ground . anxiously
looked out on the sea for the.Potem
kine. The rebel vessel was the last ob
ject they wished to see, but a troop of
Cossacks, pretending to think the
crowd was there to welcome the muti
neers, charged upon It.
I'alnff knouts, swordx and piatol*,
they brutally scattered the people, kill-
Ing' or grounding thirty. The Cossacks
did more tfbootlni? In PeressVp, a suburb
of the city, last night, and it is reported
that twenty-seven persons, including
four women, were killed there.\ '
The naval authorities, here and .at Se
bastopol declare emphatically that tho
Potemkine has a very small amount of
amunitlon on board, having expended
most of it during the maneuvers off Se
bastopol before the mutiny broke oul.
But this statement is doubtful: Military
control of the city is relaxed slightly,
but the air is filled with alarming ru
mors.
GORKY DEPLOnES PEACE PLAN.
Says Continuance of War Means Free
dom" for Russia.
ST. PETERSBURG. July 5.-Maxim
Gorky, the novelist, who Is' living at
Kokula, a small village on the coast of
Finland, has refused a flattering offer
to go on a lecture, tour in the United
States, preferring to remain for the pur
pose of aiding in the work of emancipat
ing Russia. He is one of the recognized
leaders of the constitutionalists, and is
visited daily by "person's from all parts
of Russia. He has a large income, but
gives the major portion of it to the cause
which he has at heart. â¢ â¢
Gorky, is a great "admirer of the United
States and of President Roosevelt, but
while-he gives unstinted praise to the
President's effort? toward .bringing , the
war to an end he believes : that, from j a
Russian standpoint, peace would -be a
misfortune.
"In solte of the cost of the' war." and
the great loss of life, the struggle with
Japan has proved to' be an unmitigated
blessing, to .Russia," said the novelist in
an Interview to-day. "It has* opened the
eyes of the country to the impossibility
of the present regime and has already
produced changes : which were . hardly
dreamed of two years ago! If peace
should come now, the Government would
be able to turn its attention to the inte
rior and poMlbly check the tide of re
forms." ......
Maxim Gorky's health, has much im
proved. His attorneys are making exten
sive preparations for his .trial on .the
charge of. participation in alleged revo
lutionary plots last January ,-yhich they
hope to convert Into a political demon
stration., and they are subpenaing' Minis
ters of State and other high personages.

RESCUES THIRTY
BOYS FROM SEA
Lighthouse. Keeper ' Saves
â¢the Lives of a Cap
sized Vessel's Passengers
BRINGS ALL TO SHORE
Ventures Forth Alone in a'
Light Catboat While a
Fierce Storm Is Raging
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW ORLEANS, .July" s.â Martin
Green, keeper of the lighthous off
Beauvoir, near Pass Christian, Miss.,
single-handed, in a tiny catboat. res
cued thirty, boys, 10 and 15 years old;
four men and two sailors from the cap
sized schooner on which the party from
the Young Men's Christian Association
summer camp had embarked to attend
the Blloxi regatta yesterday morning.
A squall - wrecked the schooner two
mile 3 off Beauvoir, in sight of thou
sands of summer excursionists on the
beach. Then a boat was seen going to
the rescue from the lighthouse. Un
der every inch of canvas, the little boat
heeled over at a fearful angle and
fairly fle.w over the waves. Once or
twice a groan went up from the watch
ers, as \u25a0 the storm concealed the vessel
from sight for a moment.
The man in the rescuing craft was
seen to round to under, the protecting
lee of the, c6llapsed canvas and hull
of the schooner. The waves were run
ning from six to eight feet high and
all on shore believed it was merely a
question of how many of the little pas
sengers had been swept away. Then
the catboat was seen to head straight
for shore under shortened. sail. .
Every, parent pushed out Into the
surf to catch the first glimpse of the
rescued, children. As the catboat
neared the shore it was seen to be
loaded down with passengers. "When
the boat slipped alongside the wharf a
dozen called out:.
"How many are lost?" ; â¢\u25a0 . .
- "There ain't nobody hurt," laughed
the skipper. "All they want is a towel
and some fire." - Â»
His answer broke the tension, and
as fathers and mothers and friends
hugged and kissed the rescued boys,
Captain Martin Green slipped out to sea
in his catboat. He does not yet know that
he will be recommended for the Gov
ernment life-saving medal and for the
Carnegie medal and that he will be
given a testimonial here.

MANY v-JTAEROW ESCAPES

BALTIMORE. July 6.â Great dam
age was done in Baltimore city and
county to-night by heavy rains, cul
minating in a cloudburst in the vicin
ity of Timonium, a small station on
the Northern Central Railroad about
ten miles from Baltimore. Bridgea,
houses and barns have been washed
away, livestock has been drowned,
railroad tracks have been destroyed
and telegraph and telephone lines have
been broken. So far as can be learned
to-night there has been no loss of hu
man life." i
An immense volume of water rushing
down the hills was met by unusually
high water in the harbor caused by con
tinued southeast winds and this hastened
the flooding of the streets. So rapidly
did the ; water rise in . Harrison street
that fathers bearing children on their
backs were compelled to wade in water
up to their shoulders. A young woman,
attempting to get to her home in the
eastern'section of the city, was swept
into the harbor but was rescued by th*
police.
A car on the Gay street line was over
whelmed by the flood and the passengers
were rescued by a police patrol wagon
with considerable difficulty. When at itÂ»
highest, the water extended nearly as far
west as Calvert street and to within half
a block of the City Hall on Hoillday
street.
In the basement of the building in
which the offices of ths Associated PresÂ«
and the "Western Union Telegraph Com
pany are located, the water was two feet
deep and the^delivery department of tha
Western Union was compelled 'to movÂ«.
, Mayor Timanus came from his home to
the City Hall and at once began arrange
ments for caring for sufferers from the
flood and in this he was assisted by the
chief city officers. Later the Mayor's
headquarters were transferred to a point
nearer the flooded district and every
thing possible was done to relieve dis
tress.
At 3 o'clock this (Thursday) morning
the waters are receding slowly and there
is little likelihood of further damage be
ing done. Estimates' of what has already
been done would be the- merest guesa
work.

CEREMONY IN CLEVELAND CEMETERY.
John Hay, the late Secretary of State, was buried
yesterday with simple services in Lake View Ceme
tery in Cleveland. The cortege was devoid of all
display as it moved through 'the streets of the city.
President Roosevelt, Vice President Fairbanks and
present and former members of the Cabinet at
tended the funeral.
President and Vice President With the
Cabinet Members Attend Funeral.
ALL OSTENTATION AVOIDED
Fitting Services Held in Small Chapel
at the Lake View Graveyard.
MANY FLORAL OFFERINGS
CLEVELAND. July 5.-The body of
John Hay rests to-night in his family
burying ground in a corner of Lakeview
Cemetery. Five hundred feet to the west
of where the Secretary lies is the great
memorial to James A. GarfieltJ; 200 feet
to the north rises the monolith of the
Rockefeller family; closer still are the
Craves of the Otises .and the Busts. Most
of these men were buried with funeral
pervices far more elaborate than was
John Hay; certainly none of them could
have been interred with ceremony more
simple.
Sir Mortimer Durand, the British Em
bassador, came direct to Cleveland from
his summer home at Lenox, Mass., and
was, owing to delays experienced on the
road, able to reach the Chamber of Com
merce buildine only a few moments be
fore the funeral started for_the cemetery.
Robert T. Lincoln and Lyman J. Gage
had been misinformed as to the hour at
which the body was to be removed from
the Chamber of Commerce, and they
joined the funeral cortege after it had
gone only a short distance.
President Roosevelt's train on the
Pennsylvania Railroad rolled into the
Union Station this morning exactly at the
time setâ 9 o'clock. A committee of
twf-lve prominent citizens of Cleveland
was in waitinz to receive him, headed by
Governor Herrick. Vice President Fair
banks, Associate Justice William R. Day
of the United States Supreme Court, and
Samuel Mather, a brother-in-law of Mrs.
Hay, were also present.
ARRIVAL OP PRESIDENT.
When the train came to a stop, the
President was entirely ready to leave.
The party passed through the station
archway to the line of waiting carriages.
Troop A <?f the Ohio National Guard,
\u25a0which was to act as the President's
escort, was drawn up in line opposite
the doorway, and the sabers flashed in
a salute as the President appeared. He
raised his hat in acknowledgment and
bowed repeatedly in approvaJL.of the fine
appearance presented by the' youthful
â¢ As soon as the Tnembers of the Cabinet
had entered their carriages, the cavalry
passed to the front of the column with
the exception of four troopers, who rode
two on each side of the President's car
riage. The drive from the station to the
Chamber of Commerce building was com
pleted in twenty minutes. A large crowd
was gathered around the building, but
there was no demonstration and no ap
lause.
The President and Vice President Fair
banks entered the -hall of the Chamber
of Commerce. There was a brief wait
until the members of the Cabinet and of
the local reception committee had formed
in column behind the President and Vice
President and then the doors of the audi
torium were slowly turned back and the
party, passing between rows of sentries
s\ - ho stood with presented arms, entered
the room where the casket lay.
CABINET IX ATTENDANCE.
' Mrs. Hay had expressed a desire that
the casket be not opened unless President
Roosevelt should express a desire to gaze
upon the face of the Secretary once more.
This was explained to the President on
the train and he at once expressed him
self as unwilling to disturb. the arrange
ments already made.
The President, Vice President and Gov
ernor Herrick passed around to the head
of the casket while in a semi-circle around
the hall stood the members of the present
and of former cabinets.
Those present were, besides the mem
bers of the local reception committee,
Elihu Root. ex-Secretary of War; Secre
tary of the Treasury Leslie M. Shaw,
Postma6tcr General Cortelyou, Attorney
'General Moody. Secretary of the Xavy
Charles J. Bonaparte, Secretary of the
Interior Hitchcock, ex-Attorney General
Knox, ex-Postmaster General Charles
Emory Smith. ex-Secretary of the Navy
Paul Morton, Secretary Metcalf of the
Department of Commerce and Labor;
Secretary of Agriculture Wilson; Ekl
Hiokl, secretary of Khe Japanese lega
tion at Washington; Secretary to the
President Loeb, Supreme Court Justice
Day and Colonel Webb C. Hayes.
The party remained grouped about the
casket for nearly forty minutes and
during the time a band of crepe was
placed around the left arm of each man.
CAVALRY WITH FUNERAL.
At Just 10 o'clock thÂ« funeral left the
Chamhber of Commerce building. The
casket, carried by six non-commissioned
officers of the cavalry troop, was borne
to the hearse between two lines formed
by the present and former Cabinet offi
cers, who acted as honorary pallbearers.
The. Prmident. Vice President and Gov
ernor Herrick entered the first carriage
and the honorary pallbearers and mem
bers of the local committee occupied the
remainder of them. There were twenty
four carriages In the column as, headed
by the cavalry moving at a quick trot,
it passed along Park place and turned
east on Euclid avenue.
None of the members of the Hay family
was at the Chamber of Commerce build
ing and in company with a few friends
they awaited the arrival of the funeral
cortege at Wafie Chapel Inside the ceme
tery grounds.
ExacUy on the minute of 11 o'clock
Troop A halted opposite the chapel door.
Mm Hay, Clarence Hay, Mr. and Mrs.
Samuel Mather and Mr. and Mrs.. James
W. Wadsworth Jr., son-in-law, .and
daughter of Secretary and Mrs. Hay, with
a few of their friends, were already in
the chapel.
The casket, covered with the national
colors and the beautiful wreaths sent; by
President and Mrs. Roosevelt and by
the members of the diplomatic corps, was
carried in. the President, Vice President
and honorary pallbearers following , with
uncovered heads. The "chapel is not large
and there were not seats ; for ; all, fully
thirty men being grouped around the
doorway.
SERVICES AT CEMETERY.
The services were opened by a quar
tet of male voices, which 1 sang
"StilL Still With, Thee." and
then Rev. Dr. Hayden, pastor emer
itus of the Old Stone Church, delivered
a brief prayer, after which Rev. A. B.
Meldrum, active pastor, read extracts
from the Scriptures beginning with :"I
am the resurrection and the life, saith
the Lord," and including portions of the
fifteenth chapter of First Epistle to the
Corinthians and the fourteenth chapter
Of St. John.
The pallbearers, at the conclusion of
the scriptural reading,' carried the cas
ket through' the door to the hearse,
while the quartet softly sang Tenny
son's "Crossing the Bar." *
The funeral, leaving the chapel,
passed along the beautiful and wind
ing driveways of the cemetery until
the Hay burial lot, one-fourth of a mile
distant, was reached.
Mrs. Hay. Clarence Hay, Mr. and
Mrs. Wadsworth and Mr. and Mrs.
Mather stood at the head of the grave.
President Roosevelt, with Vice Presi
dent Fairbanks at his side, was a few
feet to the left of Clarence Hay.
The quartet sang two stanzas of the
hymn "For All the Saints Who From
Their Labors Rest" and then." while
inch by inch the casket was lowered.
Dr. Hayden recited the committal serv
ice of the Presbyterian church. When
he concluded, the quartet sang the final
stanza of the hymn and the benedic
tion by Mr. Meldrum brought the serv
ices to a close, __ '
There was a brief_ pause after Dr.
Mcldrum's voice had ceased and the
first move to leave the place was made
by Mrs. Hay. She turned away from
the grave and as she passed President
Roosevelt reached her hand to him. He
took it in both of Jiis own, bowing
deeply as he did so.
3IAXY FLOR.iL TRIBUTES.
Mrs. Hay, with the members of her
family, returned to the residence of
Samuel Mather, while the President and
his party, the carriage of the executive
surrounded by the members of the cav
alry troop, went at a rapid pace direct
ly to his train, which. he reached at
about 1 o'clock. After a short wait in
the yards of the Pennsylvania' Railroad
the train started on, the entire party
returning with him, except Secretary
Metcalf, who will remain in the West.
The Brave and the balance of the
Hay family lot were fairly . covered
with flowers. A few of the tributes
were as follows: President and Mrs.
Roosevelt, a wreath of orchids, maiden
hair ferns and cycas leaves; King Ed
ward VII, a wreath of orchids; the Jap
anese Government, a wreath of iris
flowersrthe President's Cabinet, wreath
of sweet peas, a cluster of orchids and
a base of Easter lilies and American
Beauty roses; the Diplomatic Corps, a
standing wreath of green emilax, with
sprays of lilies of the valley and of
lavender orchids and a base of Easter
lilies and American Beauty roses.
â¢ A memorial service was held In the
Chamber of Commerce building this
afternoon at which Governor Herrick
and a number of others spoke.
ROOT TIED TO EQUITABLE.
Reported That He Will Be Unable to
Succeed Hay.
NEW YORK, July s.â lt was declared
during the day in Wall street that it
willbe impossible for former Secretary
of War Root to succeed John Hay in
the Cabinet because of his engagements
with Thomas F. Ryan and the Equitable
Society.
There have been expectations that
President Roosevelt would ask him to
become Secretary of State, but it Is now
_said that he has accepted retainers to
"the amount of $200,000, the larger por
tion of which Is payment for his ser
vices in connection with the Insurance
company's troubles. Ryan and the'men
of the Equitable management ' have be
come so dependent upon Root's great
knowledge of law that they feel they
cannot get along without him. : /
The question has'often been raised as
to the legality of the action of Ryan in
purchasing the control>of the stock of
James Hazen'Hyde and of. the appoint
ment of a board of trustees to manage
it. It is insisted that all these things
were done on the advice of Root, and
should legal complications ensue he is
expected to defend his clients. â¢ That he
pledged himself to guide. the affairs of
the insurance company to a successful
Issue is asserted on the best authority,
and it was stated by one of his friends
that this would keep him from return
ing to the Cabinet even if he were urged
to do so. ' - /
A prominent lawyer, who is convers
ant with Equitable affairs, said that the
story ; that the policy holders miy{ di
vide the surplus of the society oaring to
a "slip" in the legislative bill of 1868
was misleading. The policy holders, he
declared, can do nothing to recover on
any policy. , The policy holder will find
that he must live up. to. his tfonkract.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
'PITTSBURG, July ,s.â Robert D. Me
"Goniglc. famous throughout the United
States as author, phllanthrophlst, club
man and lecturer, was found dead at 11
o'clock this morning in B the fashionable
Hotel Lincoln. Every effort was made to
keep his death a secret. The Coroner's
office ' refuses to" say whether or not he
committed suicide. Everything points to
theconclusion that he killed himself. An
inquest, will- be held to-morrow.
Several years ago McGonigle went to
California, in company with R. J. Tlndall,
son-in-law of United States Senator P. C.
Knox. He spent many months in San
Francisco, Los Angeles and Pasadena.
While there he wrote a book, '.'When I
Went West," which he dedicated to Tin
rtall. Afterward he delivered many lec
tures in 'California, illustrating them with
: views of the country. - . - â¢â¢ â¢ _^Â» ':
\u25a0' McGonlgle was last seen alive when he
went to his room last evening. When he
failed to leave his room this morning the
door was forced , open and he was found
dead, an empty* vial that had contained
a solution of chlorate being found.
Coroner Joseph G. Armstrong said to
night that the case was a mysterious one.
He would commit himself, no further.
McGonigle was 53 years of age. A few
years ago his fortune was estimated. at
several million dollars. " He was â¢ the
founder of the Alleghany Light Company,
afterward absorbed by the Philadelphia
Company. \u25a0 .
McGonlgle devoted almost his entire life
to~ charity. He founded the Kingsley
House, the Pittsburg Golf Club, the Pitta
burg Country Club and the Duquesno
Riding Club. He gave away; the greater
part of his x money, and recently he lost
$300,000 in an unwise speculation. Then
his friends. deserted him and he became
morose. He frequently threatened to end
his life. ... \u25a0 - ' . . .

PROBING WEST VIRGINIA GRAFT
Governor and Ex-
Governor Are
Accused.
Division of Fees
the Offense
Alleged.
Witnesses Refuse
to Testify for
State.
Special Dispatch to Tbe CalL
CHARLESTON, W r . Va., July 6.â West
' Virginia is still echoing with 'the expos
ures of political graft made during the
recent session of the State Legislature.
Some of thÂ« exposures have been ' held
before the limelight of probing tribunals
and are now a closed book. There are
several graft investigations still hanging
In the balance, with the most Interesting
chapters yet to be written.
One of these Investigations, "which is
yet to be terminated and from which In
teresting developments are expected. Is
to probe Into the charges made against
ex-Governor A. B. White, while he was
still Governor cf the State, and ex-Sec
retary of State William O. Dawson, who
is now Governor. The charges were that
these two officials divided the enormous
fees of the Secretary of State's office and
were guilty of other malfeasance in of
fice. The Secretary of State was an ap
pointee of the Governor and It was
claimed that the division was made In
consideration of the appointment.
As the former secretary is now "Gov
ernor, the charges place him in an ex
ceedingly embarrassing position. They
\u25a0were made on the floor of the Senate by
State Senator Caldwell, and an investi
gation was Immediately ordered.
The committee held a meeting In this
city several days ago, but up to the pres
ent time has been unable to secure wit
nesses, i Those who were summoned,
among whom was Caldwpll, refused to
obey the mandates of the investigation
â¢\u25a0committee, and, when placed under ar
rest, sued out writs of habeas corpus,
and went Into the Federal court of this
district, claiming that the committee had
no power to 6ubpena them during a re
cess of the Legislature. Their conten
tion was upheld by the District Federal
Court and yesterday an appeal was
taken to the United States Supreme
Court by the State's Attorney, ex-Gov
ernor William A. McCorkle. Until the
higher court hands down a decision in
this case., the work of the legislative
investigating committee is at a stand
still..
CONFESSES BLACKMAIL
Wltness In Chicago Tunnel Scandal
â¢ Implicates Former City Official.
CHICAGO, July s.â Edward J. Judd,
State witness in the Illinois Tunnel
Company forgery case, virtually con
fessed on the stand to-day to having
blackmailed Albert S. Wheeler, presi
dent of the company and one of the
defendants. Judd's recitation on this
part of the scandal was dramatic. He
talked with great rapidity and scarce
ly halted for breathing spells. His"
"tale of woe," in which he admitted
lie had threatened Wheeler with crim
inal court prosecution unless Wheeler
settled with him and paid . him the
$42,000 he demanded, had the jurors
and court spectators spellbound.
In the course of his recital Judd told
of a letter he had written to former
Clerk Loeffler from New Orleans and of
Loeffler having gone to New Orleans
to quiet him and prevent his making
the threatened expose. He said Loef
fler gave him $100 on this occasion and
agreed to look to Wheeler for pay
ment.
'"I told Loeffler," said Judd, "that he
was not treating me right and that I
â¢would be compelled to expose him. I
had nothing against Loeffler, but I told
-him that I might have to injure him to
get back at Wheeler. Loeffler said I
must not do that and he would see
jWheeJer and make him treat me
â¢'white,'"
â¢ State's Attorney Healy at this junct
ure served notice on Loeffler and the
defense to produce the letter Judd tes
tified he had written to Loeffler from
New Orleans.
It was also disclosed by Judd's testi
mony, during which he never removed
; his eyes from the coterie of defendants
and their counsel, especially President
Wheeler of the Tunnel Company, that
"Wheeler, from the inception of the
* tunnel scheme, had plans to secure
legislation from the Council enabling
him to utilize the tunnel bore as a sub
way for traction purpose, which legis
lation he ultimately secured so that
the bore was* enlarged sufficiently to
enable the safe passage of merchan
dise cars. It appeared, however, that
'the entire scheme contemplated the
using of the bore for passenger serv-
Ice.
The latter part of Judd's testimony

SHARP BREAK IS WUKAT

Favorable Crop Reports Cause Decline
- In September Option in Chicago
and Xew York.
CHICAGO, July 6. â After selling
within a four cent range here to-day,
.wheat for September delivery closed
at a net decline of 202 % c, compared
with Saturday's final figures. The wide
fluctuation Jn price was due almost
wholly to conflicting reports as to the
condition of the spring-sown crop. At
the start the market was decidedly
strong as a result of Influential buying
brought out by damage reports from
private sources. Initial quotations on
September were up He to l%c at 90
to 91 %c. Later a sharp break In
prices occurred, September dropping to
87Vic. An official report asserting that
spring wheat is in excellent condition
was the occasion for the severe drop.
' NEW YORK. July s.â The New York
wheat market broke 3VÂ»c,a bushel to
day, September selling from 94% c to
JlSc. It was duo to conditions re
ported In the Trade Meeting, a weekly
Government report that failed to con
firm private advices as to - the' North

CHICAGO'S RAILWAY
PLAN IS MODIFIED
City Will Not Absolutely
Own the Traction
CHICAGO, July s.â Mayor Edward F.
Dunne told the City Council to-night his
plans for municipal ownership of traction
properties. It was not municipal owner
ship absolutely, but, as the Mayor ex
plained, the nearest thing possible under
existing conditions, and he asked the
Aldermen to consider It carefully. Abso
lute municipal ownership and operation,
the Mayor saii he did not 'consider prac
tical Just now. . ' .
The plan which the Mayor offered pro
vides for the incorporation of a company,
managed by five . men who command . the
confidence of the people of Chicago. \u25a0 To
this company Is to be granted a twenty
year franchise covering the streets on
which the rights of the old companies
already have expired or soon will expire.
It is to be shocked to the amount neces
sary to establish a street car system on
these streets, roughly estimated at 240
miles. No bonds are to be sold. The
stock is to be deposited with a trust
company which the five directors are to
select, so as to prevent a purchase of
it and consequent control by outside in
terests. The stock is, to be sold at popu
lar subscription.
At any time the city may elect It can
take over the property ' on an appraised
valuation.

fenses reported, however, is traffic in

Delano i said it was simply the inten
tion 3 on' the company^s part to abolish
the system i and thereby save $75,000 a
yea*r. .-.- ";" .. - " ' ;V y.
"While the secret service system in
its incipiency, was a small' affair,"^con
tinued Delano, "the head of. the depart
ment'^ gradually \ arrogated to himself
powers which : left him in a positibp
absolutely independent- of any official
or the^ road. Mr.; Eames formerly re
ported,! theoretically, to President Ram
say, until; I issued an order ; that such
reports are to go , to the office of Gen
eral Manager Mtller lit St. Louis."
In explaining the "methods of the de
partment affected, Delano said: ' .
â¢ "There was in the special service
department, as the secret service was
officially known, another departmentâ
that of collections. The , change by
which 121 'employes were discharged
involves % the t discontinuing of collec
tors on trains. -Fares will hereafter be
collected ; by_ individual collectors. Mr.
Eames'not, alone employed the collec
tors, but also ' the operatives who were
watchingthecollectors. -Under his su
pervision' there came also -watchmen,
gate tenders; and. crossing" men. grades
of .labor which, really : had. no connec
tion with secret service work. By hav
ing â¢ direct charge of these' '< men, the
division superintendent will be able to
get more effective, service, we believe."
The story as to' passes, is to the. ef
fect that some of the secret service
men would arrange such privileges for
scores of city^detectives and. other em
ployes of the municipality and later
ask for small loans from these men as
a return favor. This practice, it is
said, became a scandal. The action of
the^higher officials is taken by some as
a step toward -reform not only' in that
systembut in others.^ . '

smallpox, yellow lever and malaria, and' there
wad one case of bubonic placue. The "dead"
trains run r rom Colon to Monkey Hill, a mile

sometimes asÂ» many as fourteen times a .day.
and they sometimes have as many as four
cofrins aboard. In fact there m' so much, yel
low fever about that the authorities keÂ«p
ten zraws always ready for emergency case*.
- The . workinx clerical force on the- isthmus
Is about 00 i>er cent short. One district su
perintendent ' has work for seventeen clerks
and' so : far has only five. The Government
seems to be delaying paying off the men.
Forty-one cf my mates were waiting for their
money In order to catch this steamship, but
only six were paid In time to Ball.
Miss A. A. Robinson, of New York,
who was a hospital nurse on the isthmus,
also returned on the Advance. She spent
a year on the isthmus. She said:
The supply of nurÂ»>9 Is beginning to fall
off, and soon the hospital at Panama will be
very short handed. None of those who are
leaving now will return to Panama, and
many others will leave as soon aa possible.
The pay Is not sufficient. Sickness there Is

SEES NO HOPE OP CANAL.
Yeomana Snym I'nnnmn Frojeet Is Btff
' seat [II ambus of Age.
SIOUX CITY, lowa, July s.â "Wallace
was right when he resigned as chief
engineer of the Panama Canal Commis
sion." said J. D. Yeomans of this city
to-day. Yeomans was relieved by
President Roosevelt six months ago,
after having served more than a decade
on the Interstate Commerce Commis
sion. Continuing, he said:
AVallce made a fool of himself trying to tell
why. AH he should have said was. "I have
had enough of Panama aad I resign." It Is
no place for any one. to want to stay. Before
I was moved off the Interstate Commerce
Commission It was Inttmated td me that I
would be a valuable man In Panama. No
Panama for me, not for $10WT a minute. 1
didn't come to -this world to die; I came to
live. "â¢*\u25a0'. - \u25a0: isr'."*
The Panama canal is the biggest humbug of
the age. I have no hesitancy In saying that in
my \u25baopinion, there will never be a canal built.
Xo Important American engineer, who was not
paid for It. 'ever hazarded thÂ«- opinion that
there would be a canal all , the way through.
The last | monthly report of work done show*
that It. will take 110 yean to finish It. The
weeds grow ln'-onÂ«Â«nd faster than-they carry
the dirt ouf of the other*- .... .-, ; -
No engineer has ever found a rock or clay,
bed in that celebrated Cutebra. cut. where ' the
United States has done the most of its work.
There ' has â¢ been a cut 0f'350 feet there and
thirty inches of rain falls In thirty hours down
thpse banks. Do* s any one suppose that the
alluvial sell won't wash down In there to
make a mud canal too thick for a Government
dredgeboat to. keep afloat In? -
The Nicaragua route, was. feasible and for
that reason it was abandoned. I was a mem
ber of a syndicate prepared to build a canal
there for " 5120.000.000, which would have car
ried 27,000,000 tons of merchandise annually.
We were â¢ prepared to do the work In four
years. This looked too much like a canal and
the great Influence behind the present trans
continental transportation business suddenly
ceas#d opposing the canal project and pushod
the clamor over to Panama, j The men wno run
our big railroads know what Panama Is. By
the Nicaragua route as projected a ship could
leave New York harbor and : arrive In San
Francisco in eighteen days. \u25a0 No freight train
is now acheduled to go overland Inside' of
twenty-three days. That's what struck in the
Nicaragua project. Red tape, civil service re
form anil yellow eyes wilt do the rest.
| Do you suppose Congress will go on putting
up ' monej" ' for : gravestones and quinine down
there? '.â¢Â» lam glad I am not In It. Everybody
dnwn^there wants to do what "Wallace did or
what the hops of the .whole works is doing
live in New York and run It by proxy. Why
should -Shonts or. Wallace be chosen ' to dig a
canal anyway? They, never ~ did a- piece -of
work in their lives o \ f this sort " or anything
calculated - to ' equip \u25a0" them for doing It. Every
man selected so far to do : the work . has be*>n
picked from a transcontinental railroad. . Would
you pick a competitor to \u25a0\u25a0 build a competing
business? They may.be all right, but none of
It looks like \u25a0 a canal trÂ» me. -. ; .

FINDS A CURE
FOR MENINGITIS
Torino Physician in New
ark^ City Hospital Con
quers the Dread Malady
HIS METHOD IS NEW
Draws Fluid From Spinal
Canal of the Victim and
Administers No Medicine
Special Dispatch to The Call.
. NETV YORK. July 5,-Cerebro spinal
meningitis has been cured in two cases
recently In the Newark City Hospital and
three more victims of the. disease are on
the road to recovery.
Dr. Paul E. Kauschenbach, an 'interne,
who has been on the house staff only,
since December last, became the assistant
house physician on May 1 and took
charge . of the medical wards. Deciding
upon experiments of his own when bis
increased authority permitted he took a
course opposite to much that has been
done. The result Indicates that he has
found a successful treatment for the
disease.
It consists of drawing one to two ounces
of the fluid of the spinal canal from the
victim as soon aa the case comes under
his observation and as often thereafter
as he believes necessary; two hot baths
dally, the water at a temperature of 113
degrees Fahrenheit: all the natural light
and fresh air possible: absolute quiet:
first a fluid, ihen a soft and then a full
diet; good nursing and no medicine.
"I took tho patients from a darkened
room, on the theory that germs thrive In
the dark." said he. "Annie Beck, 33 years
old, came on May 1, unconscious and de
lirious. She "went out cured on July 1.
Raphael Linfondl, 25 years old. came on
March 21 and went out cured on June 23.
The fluid first taken from the spinal canal
was cloudy and filled with germs."

SACRAMENTO. July 5. ; â Juan'Fuebla.
alias Antonio Martinez, a Mexican. .13
serving a life sentence In the State

matter to the District Attorney of LO3

IN OLD MEXICO
Southern Pacific Engineers
Are Planning to Tap Main
â¢ Line at Douglas, Arizona
TO EXTEND COAST LINE
'iJoth Boads Will Join After
Passing the Yaqui River
and Enter Guadalajara
\u25a0 Information has reached Ban Fran
cisco that the Southern Paclflo has
been surveying Mexican territory and
that perhaps within a year it will be
running through trains to Guadalajara
and Mexico City from San Francisoo
and Eastern points.
For over a year the Southern Pa
cific's engineers have been eurveylng
the country along the coast line from
GuaymaÃ, the present terminal, to
Guadalajara. Word comes that the
"Southern Pacific's engineers have also
been surveying an interior route that
will leave the main line at Douglas,
Ariz.,' on the Mexican border, head due
south through the Yaqul country and
follow the Yaqul River until it Joins
the coast line.
J. C Naugle. general manager of the
Sonora Railway and agent of the Har
riman interests, has had several Cali
fornia engineers go over the coast road
and the proposed Interior road. The
territory traversed by the lines will be
eelf-supporting and the connection of
the -port of Guadalajara with Mexico
City will be a matter of only a little
time.
The proposed Interior route will tra
verse a section rich in agricultural and
mineral wealth. After leaving Doug
las on the main line of the Southern
Pacific the road will head due south,
following the eastern bank of the
Montezuina River. From there It will
( ontlnue through the territory of the
Yaqui Indians, opening up a fertile re
gion-
After leaving Yaaul territory the
road will swerve southwesterly along
the course of the Yaqul River and be
fore reaching the coast line will cross
the tracks of the Kansas City, Mexico
and Orient Railway. From the point
of Junction with the coast branch one
line will continue to Guadalajara.
Another extension of the line is also
proposed. It is argued by engineers
that better service can be secured by
the building of a road to connect
Guaymas. the present terminal of the
Southern Pacific, with Onavas on the
Yaqui River. In this way the country
could be tapped by the Southern Pa
cific without the expense of running a
line from Douglas.
VACUU3I METHOD USED
IX TRANSPORTATION
Decay of Perishable Goods
Prevented. Doing Away
With Refrigerator Cars.
A new process in the preservation of
perifhable food products which, it is
caid, -Kin revolutiomze the transporta
tion of iruits and vegetables^in Califor
nia, has been invented and successfully
tested by Charles Blagburn of Antioch.
Use cf the vacuum is made in keeping
the food from spoiling and the pro
moters of the scheme say that by this
\u25a0 means products can be packed for three
months without decay.
The inventor says that by this means
fruit can be shipped ripe which will not
necessitate picking before the conditions
are the best, and that the fruit will not
ripen farther, once it is put In the
vacuum. Refrigerator cars arA much
ice is required now in the transporta
tion of perishable commodities, causing
great expenditure and lessening . . the
profit in the trade to growers, but with
the packing of the articles in. these air
tight boxes tiiey can be shipped in or
, dinary freight cars with more dispatch
and less cost. A refrigerator car, from
Kan Francisco to New York calls for
an expenditure of $750, while the pro
moters of the new scheme say that their
way will cost only $200.
Tne company's plant at Antioch is
fitted for the unlimited production of
these vacuum boxes. They have Inves
tigated the possibilities of the scheme
and say that by the new way fruit men
will be able to get a great deal" more
of their products on the- market, making
the cost to the consumer less and at
the E&rr.e time giving a greater profit
to tlie grower.
The process Is the old scientific one
that a vacuum promotes longevity. Air
tight boxes of practically any size are
manufactured, and when the fruits or
other products are placed in them, the
vacuum producer is applied and the air
within is exhausted. Then pura nitro
gen is forced in to produce equilibrium
â¢60 the atmospheric pressure will not
cause* a collapse. Nitrogen alone has no.
effect whatever on the substances to be
preserved, while nitrogen and the many
.elements in the atmosphere which were
in the brx before a vacuum was pro
duced are detrimental to preservation.
DoinsÂ« of Sneak Thieve*.
Trlcksey Roberts, 9 Hinckley alley,
reported to the police yesterday that
during her temporary absence from her

LEAVE FOR CAMP
IN REDWOODS
Youngsters Begin an Outing
Amid Trees of Cazadero
Under Charge of Y.M. C. A.
At 7:30 this morning 120 boys will leave
the heat and dust and wind of San" Fran
cisco, take the early train on the North
Shore Railway, and in the free wilds of
the beautiful Cazadero redwoods, where
they can fish and climb trees to their
heart's content, they will camp for four
weeks under . the guardian care of the
Young Men's Christian Association. .
They will grow strong and healthy In
the pungent atmosphere of the moun
tains, their little muscles will become
taut by outdoor climbing, and one month
from to-day they will- be brought back,
sunny and rugged, to fond parents, who
will have enjoyed the rest given them by
having their youngsters oft in the moun
tains during July. :
Each year the Young Men's Christian
Association takes a crowd of boys for a
vacation Into the mountains. Camp Mc-
Coy, their destination Is always named,
after their veteran leader, H. J. McCoy.
This is the sixth season that has . been
spent in the woods, sometimes at one
place, sometimes at another, but the
number of children who attend has been
steadily Increasing from the first. The
cost is slight to the boys, $17 paying the
entire expense of the month's outing.
Bach boy who goes promises to obey
the rules of the camp. He does simple
duties around the tents, carries wood for
the evening fires, and studies a little each
day. He wears a red Jersey with the
emblem of the Institution across his
bosom and on his head flaunts the little
trl-colored Jockey cap which marks him
as one of the camp boys. For every ten
little men there Is a leader, and in charge
of all -is Carl Coloneus, boys' di
rector of the Young Men's J?hrlstian As
sociation. Medical care is provided.
Another delegation of campers will.be
sent two weeks from to-Klay.
Able people are seldo*m envious.

NEWS OF THE COUNTIES ABOUT THE BAY
HOUSE WRECKED
BY LARGE BOMB
Poor and Windows JJlown
Out and Mrs. J. Mac Donald
Narrowly Escapes Death
'REVENGE THE MOTIVE
Woman Says That Deliberate
Attempt; Was Made by Ene
mies to' Destroy Her Home
OAKLAND. July 5. â Mrs. John Alac-
Dor.ald, residing: nt 522 Twenty-second
street, narrowly escaped death or seri
eits injury early yesterday, morning
when a large bomb, which had been
placed on the front porch of the dwell
ing Uy some ono at present unknown,
exploded, tearing the front door from
Its hinges and partially wrecking the
house. Mrs. Mac Donald had been
awakened about 1:SO n. m. by a mys
terious noise at the front of her homo,
and 'altboHsrh only herself and two
daughters, Miss Jean and Miss Stella
Mac Donald, were in the house at thy
time, she arose and went downstairs
to investigate.
* Just as Mrs. MacDonalu reached the
fo.ot of the stairs close to the front door
the bomb exploded, hurling the front
doorslnto the hallway and breaking ev
ery window in the front of the hours.
The falling door just missed striking
tlrs. MacDonrdd as it was lung from
Its hinges, and the explosion filled tha
hall with clouds of stifling powder
EmoUe. The flames of the burning ex
plosive set firÂ« to the hangings in the
\u25a0hallway, and for a few . moments thÂ«j
dweihng was threatened with "further
damage by fire. -â¢ \u25a0â¢ \u25a0\u25a0\u25a0-\u25a0\u25a0>
Mrs. AlacDonald's daughters were
awakened by the heavy explosion and
hurried down the stairs. to ( find their
mother lying stunned oh the floor. In
danger ot fa'.llnu a victim to the ftre.
After carrying their mother beyond the
-frea<:h of the flames the young: ladies at
tacked the f.m and extinguished ,lt
Vithout much damage to the dwelling.
Mrs. Mac-Donald declares that shÂ«
does not bellÂ«w that the explosion wa.l
the result of a Fourth of July Joke, but
Bays that she Is certain that an attempt
_fcras made to wreck her home. She
say.s that her' daughters conduct a
dancing: school on San Pablo awnue.
and that several weeks ago a number
of young hoodlums, who were refused
Admission to 'ihe hall where the classes
are held, made threats th.it they would
"get square" with the girls for not
allowing- them to enter the hall. Both
Mrs. HacDonald and her daughters ex
press the belief that some members of
.the crowd ate responsible for the dam
age to their home, and this morning
they placed the matter in the hands of
the police.
An examination of the remains of the
exrlodcd bomb shon- that It must have
(j been about twelve inches long by about
cix in diameter, and the effects of the
explosion indicate that It was loaded
much ,morÂ« heavily than Is customary
. by manufacturer? of fireworks.
SCORES THE OWNERS
OF DAIRY ANIMALS
Berkeley Health Officer Is
* sues Statement Regarding
' . Spread of Tuberculosis.
BERKELEY, July S.â According to Dr.
George Reinhardt, health officer of Berke
ley, tuberculosis In cows has become
lo general around the bay that dairymen
regard the stamping out of the disease
is impossible. Dr. Reinhardt Bays it is
.this belief that has inspired a score of
lalrymen in Berkeley to enjoin the
iutborities of Berkeley from enforcing
Ihe ordinance retiring them to submit
their herds to the tuberculin test. Dr.
Reinhardt to-day issued a statement re
tarding the injunction and the spread
it tuberculosis in cows in this vicinity.
ft Is in part as follows:
Experience has ehown that where careful
mention has not been paid to the health of
the herds from 16 to 20 per cent are tuber
Â»u!ou*. The. use of. tuberculin In cows a
test that Is absolute in Its findings 'bÂ«s
poused the ire of dairymen. An animal may
C>e seriously affected with tuberculosis and not
reveal that fact by outward appearance. Con
frequently tuberculosis is a disease that can
fiever be eradicated from a herd without the
ese of the tuberculin test.
On account of the high percentage of tuber
culous animals around San Francisco Bay
Jairymen have come .to regard ft as*a neces
tsry evil and one ' that cannot t>e eradicated
rhe belief that the eradication is impossible
la not true. " . â¢ \u25a0â¢
What the ordinance require* is that no cow
iufferinr 'with the Alsease of' 'tuberculosis
ffcall be retained, la â the herd. Owners are
thus left free to dispose of their tuberculous
cnimalj as they see flti â¢ â¢

CAPTAIN C. H. COLE YfsP^U^tM-M^^P^
T^ ; : Â» ;
NEWLY MARRIED COUPLE,* FOR WHOM THERE IS YET SWEET ROMANCE
IN LIFE. THOUGH THEIR YEARS ARE COUNTED BY THE SCORE. THEY
WERE MARRIED YESTERDAY AT OAKLAND.
OAKLAND. July s.â Despite his
sixty-five years Captain : Claude H.
Cole, a leader in the ranks of
the Independent Order of Odd Fel
lows, has succumbed to the wily arts
of the saucy love god. The bride he
has won was Mrs. Mary Etta Gordon,
for many years in charge of the busi
ness of E. L. Sargeant, dealer in sew
ing machines. The gallant captain led
his choice to the altar last evening at
the Gordon residence, 1233 Myrtle
street. There in the presence of a few
intimate friends the marriage service
was read by the Rev. Dr. Morrison of
St. Mary's Church. The news of the
wedding comes as a great surprise to
many who know Captain Cole and his
bride.
Mrs. Cole is her husband's Junior by
nine years. Their acquaintance .had
been for years on a bowing -basis.
Shortly before the burning of the Ba
con block at Twelfth and Washington
streets Captain Cole, was observed to
show much interest in the business
which Mrs. Gordon was conducting.
He was smitten, but he kept his secret
until a few months ago, when the
words were spoken that won the
widow for his own. Cole was a wid
ower.
The groom has been retired from the
Police Department for years." He is a
major "in^the canton .of the Odd Fel
lows and was formerly captain j of Can
to"nT'Oakland" No.~IIT *
TALKS HIMSELF INSANE.
OAKLAND. July s.â August A. Wie- v
senhaven, a barber, has talked himself
insane, according, to.'Uie allegations of
his wife. k - He was taken to-day to the
Receiving .Hospital, where he will be
held pending his examination by the
Lunacy â¢ Commission. -
Mrs. Wiesenhaven alleges that the
barber's habit of talking to customers
took possession of her husband and he
talked and talked till all his customers
deserted him. Then he turned his vo
cal batteries urwn his wife and two,
children until finally the* wife, in sheer
desperation, swore to an insanity com
plaint.
In his own behalf .Wiesenhaven ad
mits that" his reason is dethroned and
declares that it is the result of a, fall
fr6m a scaffold sixteen years ago. .lie
declares that" he do.e^ not wish to talk,
but the words;come;to his lips and he
has not the power to repress them.

Parks has completed the assessment
roll for. the fiscal year 1905-1906 and
turned it over to the County Board of
Equalization. The figures show a net
increase in valuations of . $342,000 over
the last ilscal year after deducting
$100,000 allowed for. the exemptions on
personal property under the act passed
by the Legislature. This great increase
is caused by the cutting? up of a large
acreage in Southern Murln Into small
holdings, which have been rapidly
boujrht and improved by San Francis
cans. ' It is safe to say that the valua
tion of real estate and improvements in
Ross Valley, starting from Corte Ma
dera and running to Fairfax, has been
increased nearly $200,000. Mill Valley.
San Rafael and Sausallto have added in
the order named to the increased valu
ation. From the present outlook in real
estate circles the. fiscal year of 1906-7
will exceed 1905-6's increase.

TROUBLE AHEAD
FOR HOSPITAL
Objection Is Raised to Con
tinuance of the Stanford
Students' Guild Sanitarium
PETITION TO BE FILED
Palo Alto Residents Will
Request Town Trustees to
Take Action in the Matter
Special Dispatch to Tha Ca!L
PALO ALTO* Jnly B.~TherÂ« Is trou
ble in store for the Stanford Students'
Guild Hospital, which la located in
Palo Alto. The Board of Health has
called attention to the fact that the
State law forbids bringing Inside a
municipal corporation any person hav
ing a contagious or infectious disease,
and the Town Trustees at the meeting
to-morrow night will ba petitioned: to
take some action In the matter. Per
sons owning 'property adjoining thÂ«
hospital will also file protests against
its continuance, while citizens feel that
its proximity to the new grammas
school building makes It a source of
danger. It Iras-happened several times
at the opening of the fall semester that
among the students returning from all
parts of the country there have been
cases of contagious diseases and
der the State: law these could ' not' be
brought from the campus? to the hos
pital. It is danger from this ' source
which the Board of Health : seeks to
guard against.
Dr.* W. F. Snow will present a letter
asking, that the Town Trustees defer
action until the hospital board of man
agers ' can â¢ be convened, most of the
members now being absent.
The guild two- years ago purchased
a : large-residence and lot at the corner
of ; Lytton avenue and Cowper street
and his since had . another building
erected and the whole fitted with the
best.hospitai appliances. The Invest
ment amounts to about $12,000. Many
students have been cared for during
the two years and even townspeople
have been admitted. Any stringent re
strictions 'would work a great hardship
to the students. . ""> - "
.Mrs. Stanford always refused to al
low a hospital to be located on the
university property and ft was for this
reason that the guild established its
headquarters in . Palo . Alto. . r '.; v '
PAL.O ALTO IS AROUSED.
Residents Will A'ot Permit Optntns of

PALO ALTO. July 5. â The fact tba^
two Chinese restaurants are about -to
be opened here la arousing much pub
lic indignation. The citizens have never
permitted a Chinese business place of
any sort to become established in Palo
Alto. . This - has ordinarily been pre
vented by peaceful means, but on one
occasion * both the Chinaman -and -the
landlord were given twenty- four hours
to 'leave townâ *nd their went. TfcrÂ«ats : Â«v.

Committee on Enrollment
Reports That Satisfactory
Progress Is Being Made
PORTLiAND, July E.â The National
Woman's Suffrage Association brought
its meeting to a close to-day after one
of the busiest sessions of the conven
tion.
A vast number of resolutions and re
r.crts were attended to, besides listening
to the address of Rabbi Emil G. Hirsch
of Chicago In the afternoon, and the ln^
coreement of woman suffrage by & num
ber of prominent men of Portland in the
evening.
Dr. Hirsch made a forceful argument
for woman suffrage, showing the anomaly
of trusting the training of our future
citizens to woman teachers and refusing
â¢to these teachers themselves the highest
privilege of citizenshrp.
Mrs. Florence Kelley in her report on
â¢Industrial Problems Affecting Women
and Children," to-day made the strong
point that the weakness of the suffrage
movement has been that it has not en
listed the active support of the working
men, and urged that the two great forces
jojn hands to work for the protection of
women and children breadwinners, and
for woman suffrage through which this
can be obtained.
Mrs. Maud Wood Park, president of the
Massachusetts Woman Suffrage League,
and Mrs. Charlotte Perkins Gibman were
the- speakers of the evening.
The convention closed with a sym
posium of prominent Portland men who
put' themselves on record as favoring
woman suffrage and ready to aid the
campaign. They were introduced by Dr.
Henry W. Coe, president of the State
Medical Association, whose wife is presi
dent of the State Woman Suffrage Asso
ciation. They included Dr. Harry Lane,
Mayor of Portland, for the Democratic
party; Dr. Andrew C. Smith, a well
known surgeon, for the Republican party,.
and B. Lee Paget for the Prohibition
party.
' At the afternoon session the committee
on civil rights reported amendments to
the child labor laws of New. Yotrk and
Pennsylvania; suffrage for/ women at
Fchool elections had been secured in
Oklahoma; compulsory education in Cali
!<*rnra; participation in the control ot
charitable institutions in Kansas ,
California, and raising the age of con-
Bent in females in Oregon and Illinois.
The committee on enrollment reported
satisfactory progress, Jhe increase of con
verts enrolled in the principal States be,-
Ir.g: Massachusetts. 13.759; New York,
11.703, and California 3000.
â¢ Memorial services were held for dis
tinguished advocates of woman suffrage
"who have died during the past year.
among them Senator George F. Hoar,
former Governor William Clafiin, Mrs..
Mary A. Livermore, Mayor Samuel M.
Jones of Toledo, Bishop Huntington of
New York, Mrs. Jane L. Stanford, Col
onel D. R. Anthony of Kansas, Rev.
George C. Lorimer. Hon. George S. Bout
well and many others.
Mrs. Carrie Chapman Catt, president
of the International Suffrage Alliance,
reported associations of nine countries
now in the federation â Great Britain,
Australia, Norway, Sweden, Denmark,
Holland, Germany, Austria. United
States. Seven others are preparing to
uniteâ Switzerland, France, Italy, Bel
gium, Finland, Iceland and Canada.
In Australia women have full suffrage
tut are organized to help those of other
countries. In Great Britain and Sweden
women have all but the parliamentary
franchise. In Norway they have the
\u25a0municipal vote and a number sit on the
beards of aldermen.
This international suffrage alliance,
which was formed in Berlin last silmmer,
will hold its first meeting In London next
June.

when he- said, fl am not prepared to recommend municipal owner
ship in Chicago."' He then described, the conditions In Glasgow
tssder wfacfi municipal ownership ts a suefcess. All who heard
understood him. They recognized at once the absence of every such
corwStxcn ra Chicago," and understood that if such conditions were
cecesiary to success the plan for Chicago must be abandoned, be
cause it xs impossible to fit the Glasgow conditions to that city.
Our,- readers will remember that when Mr. Dalrymple landed
The CaO said he would Â£nd a difference In conditions that would
make the Glasgow system Impossible in Chicago. He was unsparing
m poinrtng out the defects in the existing street railroad operation
there, feet, when, it came to passenger rates, said frankly that the
people of Chicago get more for their money than Glasgow gives.
Â£Â£^1L might have been said that all of his statements were local to
. Chicago and would not apply to other American cities. This crumb
of concfort would have been left to the advocates of municipal own
ership is San Francisco, and their approaching campaign wotrld not
have teen mjcrett (Baf^Ir. Dalrymple seems to have Improved
fci3 ti-m* getting the facts about other cities than Chicago. He found
la them all the same conditions impossible of adaptation to munici
pal owr*ershJp. There are no Glasgo-ws in the United States and
no Chicago* in the British Isles. Citie* there and here^are exactly
antipodi.i in spirit, system and administration. What fits one will
rms5t the other, and' so the hopes founded in the visit of Mr. Dal
rymple have gone, without glimmering even. There^Is nd impulse
given by Etxxa to any sort of public ownership. He advised that the
operative defects In the Chicago street car system be remedied by
ptrbiic regulation, by the exercise of the legitimate powers of gov- ;
tmmenii and that was all. When Mayor Dtmne asked him how ;
the overloading of the street cars cotild be avoided at certain hotrrs
of the dary when travel 15 congested, he replied sententious!}-, "Make
Jast 'before he left he said : "^fy mvestlgatioti has borne in
trpon rne<with finality that there is r.o greater menace to yotrr re
pcblic than this Idea of municipal ownership. Understand me, I

.â¢America.. Yon are too impregnated with politics. Your government
This, statement is not confined to Chicago, it will be observed, j
nor to ownership by cities, but applies to the whole public owner- :
ship programme, municipal, State and national. It is of as much
interest in San Francisco as In Chicago. He left it without any
'elaboration or argument, leaving that to those who choose to find
for themselves the reasons that compelled him to make it,
CoILa-tera! to the main question, Mr. Dalrymple discussed the
question of fares. To the surprise of his hearers he declared trans
fers on saxeet car lines to be the equivalent of cheap fares. In the
business operation of the roads he said that lower fares and trans
fers couM not go together. Thai would be burning the candle at
both endb. He found the American method of transfers cheaper
to the people than the low fares In 'England and Scotland. This is
an enlightening statement. But who expects that in any American
â¢ city tmdff municipal ownership and operation there will be any at
tention given to the principle involved in It? The advocates of
public ownership promise cheaper fares. The public will refuse to
give trp the transfer privilege. Here is an American condition to
which the Glasgow theory and practice cannot be adapted. If we
had municipal ownership In San Francisco, what politician In the
city government would dare refuse a lower fare, and what one
wotild dare take away the transfers?
As for the mechanical and engineering features of street ra.Il
,road operation Mr. Balrympie said that nearly all they knew in
â¢Europe had been learned from the street railroads of the United
States, and by way of caution said to the people of Chicago: "Even
if votrr street railroad facilities are not just what you want, be care
fuf about changing-. It may be that the cars are not just what they
should be, but don't let that prejudice you. The time will never
come when a street railway company v/ill be able to guarantee you
2 seat in the cars. That is an impossibility." , *
He seems to have dissolved into thin air the vision of a mil
lennium under public ownership. His impartial observations are
equally admonitory to the people not to rush into public ownership
and to the corporations operating street railways to consider always
the interests arid convenience of the public So in all directions Mr.
Dalrymple has effected good by his visit.
THE DEATH OF GENERAL GREEN.
THOUGH General Will S. Green had passed the allotted three
score years and ten, his strength and activity were so little
abated that his death startled the State like the passing of a
younger man. He W2S a great Californian, a pioneer before wh;om
had parsed in panorama the marvelous progress of the State, from
a picturesque wiJderae&s to a great commonwealth.
No one man had a more devoted and unselfish part in all this
development. As a private citizen, an editor, legislator and admin
istrative officer, manager of the State Board of Trade, president of
development organizations and civil engineer, he -was ceaselessly ac
tive in the interest of California. He was a partisan without rancor,
a dtizeai without guile. Hardly any other has left as great a feeling
of loneliness as he. He was a gentle and kindly man, self-educated
and thorough. Opportunities for getting wealth appealed to him
much less than opportunities for doing good, and his own interests
were always secondary to the interests of others and of the State.
He' had a; grasp of the great physical problems of California
that made his counsel of the highest value to all those" concerned in
their solation. He loved the State better than himself and counted
nothing, as a sacrifice that he could do to enhance the greatness of
California and 'the happiness of her people. In any State of -the
Union he would have been a man of mark, and. had he been : at r all "r*
self-seeker here, preferring glory to the doing of good, he could have
achieved more conspicuously for himself, but the debt of the State
to him would have been less. , :
The press of the State owes to the character of the people the
commendation of his example as an influence in the moral education
of the generations to be.

MANY MEDICAL VISITORS
Yearly Meeting Draws Prom
inent Members of Profes
sion From Many States
The American Surgical Association
jopeÃ*d its twenty-sixth annual meet
ing at the St. Francis Hotel yesterday
morning under the presidency of
Dr. George Ben Johnston of Rich
mond, Va.
After a brief executive session, dur
ing which it was decided to increase
thÂ« membership from 125 to 150, the
reading of papers was begun. The first
paper was the address of^ihe president,
Dr. Johnston, who c^iose for his sub
ject "John Peter Mettauer."
Dr. Johnston recounted the surgical
achievements of this great man. who
was born in 1787 in Prince Edward
County. Virginia, and died in 1875, and
described some remarkable operations
reformed by him In the days before
Â«ther or chloroform were discovered.
Dr. Johnston showed that the opera
tion known to the medical profession
es that for vesico-vaginal fistula and
credited to Dr. J. Marian Sims was
really performed by Mettauer years be
fore Sims either performed the opera
tion or put his work on record.
He said that there was nothing to
be found in medical literature after
Sims' time In regard to this particular
operation as having been performed by
Mettauer, but early medical history
ehowed conclusively that Mettauer was
entitled to priority.
Dr. Johnston told the convention of
his possession of 3000 pages of closely
written manuscript, foolscap size, by
Dr. Mettauer, which embraced every
phase of surgery. Why the manuscript
had not been published In book form
be did not know, as it w^as Intensely
Interesting and practical. ">
Mettauer, said the doctor, had per
formed operations as skillfully in his
day and secured results almost as re
markable as did surgeons In these mod
ern times.
METTAUER WAS ECCENTRIC.
Mettauer'e eccentricity was marked
and one of his Idiosyncrasies was to
Jv^ep- his hat on in church or when
griving evidence in court, in spite of a
remonstrance from the Judge.
In his peroration. Dr. Johnston said:
I stood in en old sravey&ra beside the ppot
Â«-here, his triumph and his labors now long
part. Mettaufr lies burled. One needed not
th<> moralizine strain of Denmark* Prince to
r-fle-t, beside that sunken and neglected
Erav<>. how swift the waters of oSlivlon now.
<Jr*>at as he was, untiring, bold, resourceful.
e^aJous, a jrodiey In his aÂ«e and a prophet
of the time to come â he leaves behind no mon
urr.T.t more durable than this flight tribute
which your courteous attention enables me to
pay to the memory of John Peter Mettauer.
The papers read were:
"EnJ Results in Surgery of the Kidney," A.
\fi!}dftr Veer. M. D.; "Excision of Portions of
th* Chest Wall for Malisnant Tumors," Em

CniEP SULLZVAX PRAISES
THE WORK OP HIS FIRE3IK.V
By Their Quirk Action Many Serious
ConflasratloiiÃ Were Prevented
, on the Fourth of July.
That more serious results were not
forthcoming from the record-breaking
r. umber of fires on the Fourth of July
was due entirely to the remarkable ef
ficiency of the San Francisco Fire De
partment. The air was dry and flames
were started often within the city, yet
very little damage was done. Chief
Sullivan praises his men and has ad
cressed the following letter to them:
t : ;<~ n the cloee of the most eventful and ac
tive Fourth of July period Jn the history Â©i
this department, during which time fifty-six
bell aianns, including two second and one
third alarm, fires wer* responded to, irrespec
tive cf the many still alarms of fire, making It
by fer the greatest fire record of this depart
ment, as compared with . former years, it is
with the greatest pleasure that I now desire
to publicly express my thank* and praise to
the c'ficers and members of this department
for the rr.ost commendable and efficient man
ner in which they performed their , respective
duties during this trylns; period.
Also to Â«he Chief and employes of the De
partment of Electricity for the admirable man
ner in which this large number of alarms were
received and sent out to thÂ£ department with
out a.f-fr.eU: *rror or fault, and to the Under
writers' Fire I'atrcl service for the prompt and
effective aE*trtaace rendered great in
likewise due. Very respectfully,
D. T. SULLIVAN, Chief Â«f Department.

Screen After, the Occurrence.
Fatigued Felix, the "wine bum," was
slumbering peacefully In the plaza.
While the cannon boomed and the fire
crackers popped, Felix snored steadily
on. A gallon of Barbary Coast paint had
wafted him to dreamland. ââ¢"
Little Ah Tie tripped along the pa,th
with a giant firecracker In his hand.
Little Ah Tie is the Peck's bad boy of
Chinatown.
The young heathen Chinee gazod at the
recumbent form of Felix and then at the
giant CTacker. His smile .was childlike
and bland. . ! -^-
Etealthily Ah Tie crept up and attached
the cracker to Felix's frayed coat tails.
He touched a punk to the fuse.
There was an explosion and a yell ot
anguish. Fatigued Felix rose several
yards into the air, unassisted. When ho
alighted he was shy a coat tail and a
large section of trousers.
Policeman Nelson heard the wail and
rushed to the place. "For decency's sake
hide yourself in the bushes," ordered
Nelson.
But Felix continued to dance up and
down in painâ a. scandal to the neigh
borhood. Nelson finally thrust him Into
a clump of shrubbery and went to look
for the cause of the disturbance.
Ah Tie was doubled up in the grass
laughing In Cantonese. His hilarity stop
ped abruptly when Nelson picked him up.
Breaking off a heavy branch of shrub
bery. Nelson gave It to the half-clothed
Felix.
"Hide yourself in this and come with
me to the station," he said.
"What for?" asked Felix.
~For indecent exposure, of course," said
Nelson. "Come along."
When Felix was called before Judge
Mogan to tell his sad story, the bailiff
offered him a chair. . ;" -^
"Not for me, Judge," said Felix,
mournfully, "I haven't sat down since.
I don't think I will ever be able to sit
down again." \Cf**
Ah Tie sobbed without cessation when
Felix made his accusation.
"Me good CHstan boy; me go Mission
schoolâ no shoot em fl* clacker. This man
liar." iâ¢-..::i â¢-. .::
"Well, it la just this way. Ah Tie: I
wouldn't discourage patriotism. I think
It ought to be boosted along. It's all
right to hurray for George Washington
and the rest, but "
Ah Tie saw that Judge Mogan meant
to be merciful and his tears dried. "Who
this Georgle Wah Sing Tong? Him China
man?" he asked.
"He was the boy who cut down his
father's cherry tree and when the father
asked him who did it he said, 'I did It
with my little hatchet I cannot tell a
lie.' "
Ah Tie looked incredulous for a mo
ment, then he exclaimed: "What a fool
Georgie was."
Ah Tie was released on probation after
a lecture on the evil effects of too much
patriotism. Fatigued Felix was sympa
thized with and sent out to walk the
streets until his injuries are sufficiently
diminished to permit his sitting down.
Five sorrowful sons of Sweden were tie
fore Judge Mogan on a charge of dis
turbing the peace of the water front dur
ing the glorious Fourth.

"Yas," we ban and got our papers,

â¢â¢We ban and got our papers, too," said
the other, producing certificates of
naturalization. . "â¢
"Well, I guess you have : the license
to butt in air right," said a the Judge,
"but the policemen tell me that you
were cruising along the front like a
Japanese squadron getting busy. How
about It?"
"Yudge," protested Hansen, "We Just
been having a jolly. time. We ban and
got our paper. , We take a glass of
beer or two. We ain't ban drunk."
"How many glasses did you take?"
asked the Judge.
"I tank I take about twenty-seven,"
replied Hansen.
"I only take twenty-one," said John
son.
"You would have saved money \u25a0 had
you^bought it by the barrel." said the
Judge. "Now look here.' Oscar 'and

Police . whistles began to burr around
the quarter. The two Japanese ? boys
were taken to the City Prison. They
explained that they .were "honest; in
dustrious, good, reliable,' flrst-class
boys and Judge Mogan took their
words for . it. After warning them
against sake the Judge let them go.
M. A. 'Sampson, the. bad man Â£} from
Reno,*- was - before Judge Cabanlss
charged with carrying a concealed wea
pon. ( .When the pistol was s exhibited.
Judge , Cabanlss, marveled. "How" could
anybody keep j that concealed ?" he lisked.
It was almost as, lone as a' rifle. 1 : r ' \u25a0
Sampson ..was carrying \ the young ar
senal in his hip 'pocket when Policeman

"Give me that ' gun," said the \ police

It Js claimed that Sampson is a pro

Attorney Thomas Hlckey. Judge Ca
banlss continued the case for one week.
Amos H. Northrup |of 931 Buchanan
street resented the "butting: In \u25a0 of. a
cop" who arrived at Northrup's resi
dence just in time to prevent North
rup from pulling: the roof down on
him. Northrup was saturated with
patriotism and started smashing: fur

like a Cossack with a, brown dwarf
after him. " Policeman' C. J. Ward en
tered the house and tried to convince
him that he could: be patriotic without
tearing his iiome down. :.\u25a0-.; ,
Northrup's ; reply was a punch that
almost staggered the policeman. Ward
pulled out his club and. brought It
down on" the quarrelsome Northrup's
cranium . several times. /, Northrup soon
became lamblike and sober.' ; :
When Northrup â¢ faced Judge Caban

The Board of Public '"\u25a0 Works yester

the terms of. a' contract awarded by , the
Board of â¢Supervisors to A. B. Clute for
furnishing -teams to the city . at ; $4 68
each. ,;; Clute i filed '\u25a0 formal notfee that; he
was i ready ; to furnish the teams in con
nection with v^the sweeping of ,the
streets, but his notice; was .-given scant
attention.'- ".'...â¢ 'â¢' \u25a0
V Commissioner f Eagan : telephoned to
Mayor Schmitz and ascertained that the
latter Ihad t not f signed ,_ the ' contract
awarded -to Clute." The board took the
ground- -;that its powers had been
usurped by;' the "Supervisors in : the
award. Its - action .was taken despite
the fact that. the city^wlll effeot a sav r
ing of $1 32 on each team, as under the
former contract the > price charged was
$6 ;per, team. > -'As thirty ' teams are used
to .remove the ' debris \ from ' streets that
have ; been swept, 1 ,,"50 me,;" 50me , ; 116.000 yearly
would be saved,-' which could be ap
plied %to - : the actual 'cleaning of "the
streets. '.The - controversy means that
the sweeping 'will be discontinued un
til it is settled.
The t Board 'of Works notified ,J. O.
Harney; that his teams would be hired
at the , old rate of $6 per day, but he
felt dubious about receiving his money
for \ the work." "Harney and Commis
sioner ['('[ of ;.- .Works .Algeltlnger ap
peared ; before iyk the Street . Com
mittee , later; rin . the day, but
no 'action was taken. Supervisor
d'Ancona said that Harney's teams
would be paid for a day or two pend
ing {the signingof the = Clute contract,
but that after that the rate of $4 68 un
der \ the , Clute contract would â¢ be~ in
sisted upon. Clute is' preparing to
bring suit against the Board of Works
to compel recognition of the contract
In that event the sweeping *of the
streets will be delayed a long time, as
Harney '\u25a0 will not supply teams at . the
price agreed upon 1 by Clute.
The board recommended to the Su
pervisors ;that> the offer of the Mer
chants'. Ice and Cold i Storage Company
to furnish 1,000,000 gallons of salt wa
ter daily to : the city to sprinkle the
streets be accepted. The water will be

FRANCHISE PETITION
City Engineer Directed to
Examine Proposed Eoute of
Ocean Shore Eailway.
The Supervisors Street Committee
yesterday referred to the City Engi
neer the petition; of the Ocean Shore
â¢Railway Company for a franchise to
operate a street railway system in the
vicinity of Illinois and; Army streets,
together with branch -lines in the Sun
set and Richmond districts. The City
Engineer was requested to examine
the proposed route and method of con
struction and to make such recom
mendations as he may deem advisable.
Several officials*, of the company were
present and. stated that they had been
negotiating with property owners
along the proposed road with a view
to agreeing on damages and expected
to, settle everything before any action
is taken : by the committee after the
City Engineer's report has been re
ceived. '
;The committee also referred to the
City Engineer the deeds filed by the
Southern Pacific . Company for, the con
veyance of lands for the widening of
Fourth, Kentucky and "Sixteenth
streets as agreed upon In Its franchise
for : the bay' shore road.
The committee decided to inspect the
scene of a spur track desired to be
built on Berry; street, south of Seventh,
by Harron, Rlckard & McCone before
reporting on the petition.
The . committee . reported in favor of
the petition of the Board of Works for
authority \u25a0to enter into contracts for
the paving of Valencia street, from
Eighteenth* to Army, .for the repair of
bituminous streets and cleaning of
sewers, for which funds are now avail
able.
'. The contract for. . furnishing three
street-sweeping, machines was award
ed to Henshaw, Bulkley & Co. for
$1005. "

almost as rare as a well-spent one." A
well-advertised store is quite as rare as
a well-managed oneâ -for the one thing
implies the other. ;

c Dr. John Hemphill filed: a petition
before Judge Coffey yesterday for per
mission to sell the Alameda County real
estate belonging to the estate of his
late v wlf e, ; Lizzie ,J. Hemphill. Dr.
Hem'phlll says the sale of: the property
is "necessary to raise money to pay
debts standing against the estate and
the concentration of the assets of the
estate will also simplify its adminis
tration. .

World's Champion Shot-Patter Goes to
Windy City In Rettponse to Call
of Manager Baird.
HEALDSBURG. July s.â Ralph W.
XtO6e, Healdsburg's phenomenal young
.athlete, who holds the world's records
for putting the twelve and sixteen
. pound shots and throwing the discus,
departed suddenly for Chicago this
morning in response to a telegram from
Manager W. Baird of the Ohicago Ath-
Jetic Club.
Rose has been rusticating at his home
in this city for 'the past month and has
*been training for the A. A. U. cham
â¢pionshlps, which will be held ln Port
land, Or., on August 4 and 5.
Rose will represent the C. A. A. ln
â¢ the coming meet. The young cham
pion weighed more than 268 pounds
when he departed.
OLD SORES
ROOTED IN THE BtOOD
Old Sores are the result of a deeply
polluted, foul blood supply. The blood
is filled with poisons, and as it finds an
outlet through the ulcer, the surround-
ing parts become diseased and the sore
eats deeper into the tissues and flesh and
becomes a permanent trouble.
Some years apo while at work, I fell
over a truck and severely injured both
of my shins. My blood became poisoned
as a result, and the doctor told me I
would have running sores' for life, and
that if they were closed up the result
'would be fatal. Under this discourag-
ing report L left off their treatment and
resorted to the usa of S. S. S. Its effects
"were prompt and gratifying. It took
only a ehort while for the medicine to
entirely euro up the sores, and I am not
dead as the doctors intimated I would
be, neither have the sores ever broken
out agrain, and some twelve years have
elapsed since -what I have described oc-
curred. Havinsr boon so signally bene-
fited fey its use I can heartily recom-
mend it as the ono great bloodpuriner.

Care Schmulback Brewing Co.
Salves, powders, plasters, etc., do no
good, and the sufferer gets disgusted and
often despairs of curing au old sore. The
trouble is in the blood and until the poison-
ous matter that is keeping up the ulcer is
driven out the place cannot heal. S. S. S.
reaches these old sores through the blood
by removing every particle of poison or
impurity from the circulation and ' build-
ing up the S3'stem. It makes the blood
healthy so that

wish. We make no charge for either.

There were only four starters in the
Brighton mile and many players went

choices, but neither of them could get
ay.-ay from Ort Wells, who Is now in
his best form.
There was little delay at post
and when the barrier went up they
were oft* together. Beldame at once
went to the front and held the lead,
with Ort Wells a good second and go
ing easy until they reached the stretch,
when Ort Wells came on and passed
Beldame, winning in a drive, while
Beldame beat Delhi seven lengths for
the place. The latter was never -better
than third. The time was a fifth of a

BY A LENGTH
Make Game>Eff ort to Pass

Short in the Final Spurt
CKEW r S N FINISH STKONG
Englishmen Maintain Steady'
Stroke, While Opponents
Are Nervous at the Start
HENLEY, England, July s.â The Le
anders defeated the Vespers of Phila
delphia in the second .heat for the
Grand Challenge ' Cup. The English
men won by a length. Time. 7 minutes
1 second. : "*
The" weather clerk provided splendid
weather for the keenly anticipated
struggle between : the Vespers and the
Leanders. This ; was the flrst race of
the . day. and the wiflespread Interest
taken- In It: was evinced by the great
crowds which thronged all the vantage
points /along the: course and congre
gated In the vicinity of the winning
post long before the hour for the start.
The Philadelphlans arrived at. the
boathouse at 10:30. "They launched
theirboat and set off on a paddle at
11:45 a. m. amidst encouraging shouts
from a big gathering of their com-,
patriots and the friendly cheers of the
British. The breeze toward the Berks
shore gave the Leanders, who had the
Berkshire side, a ' little advantage
In position. The Americans, shortly
before 'the time set for the race, rowed
up to the starting line, but the Lean
ders' shell was brought up by the out
siders, the British crew driving up to
the starting point in carriages.
In the second heat, of the semi-finals
for the Grand Challenge: Cup the Bel
gians beat the London Rowing Club by
three lengths, j Time, 7 minutes 20 sec
onds. As the boats came up to the line
preparatory to the start, the British
oarsmen seemed the more composed of
the two ' crews.
The boats got away together, but the
nervousness of the Phlladelphlans was
shown by , the â¢ splashing which, marked
their first half dozen strokes. The Le
anders started with a stroke of forty
one to the minute and the Vespers with
thirty-nine. The nose of the British
craft forged slightly to the front, but
there was not much to choose between
when they passed Temple Island In the
record time of 47 seconds. \u25a0995
The Philadelphlans, however, soon
began to give signs that the hard work
was telling on them. The Leanders
dropped their stroke to 37, but the Ves
pers could ; not do much with the lead
of half a length which the homo crew
had already obtained.
This increased to a full length. When
three-quarters of a mile had been cov
ered the Leanders again slowed down
their stroke to 34. but they always
maintained a safe lead. In . the
last quarter the Vespers made a
desperate spurt and - Early quickened
his stroke rapidly. J
The 'Americans responded and their
boat : gradually v forged up. until ;only
three-quarters ; of a' length separated
the two prows. The effort, however,
was futile. The Leanders had 1 plenty
in hand. ,They responded to the spurt
of their opponents and passed the
winning post a full length ahead. Both
crews finished strong.

again established her supremacy in an

pion, Lancia. An enormous crowd wit
nessed tbe race and gave an enthusias

line a winner.
Soon after the start Lancia began
to draw upon Thery. finally passing
him and securing six minutes* lead,
when his machine broke down. There
after Thery had the race his own way,

with "Cagno, another Italian, second;
Nazzari. third; Callois, fourth. and
Earp fifth. . . ..
Three Americans started, but they
did not make a notable showing. There
was much surprise among the contest
ants at this. Lyttle. who was placed
twelfth, and who was the only.Ameri
can to finish, ln reply to a question
said: .
-"I had almost completed' the first lap
at good speed when, while crossing a
rut. the principal lubricating tube of
my machine burst beyond all possibil
ity of repair. I continued the . race,
however, my mechanician holding the
tube together with his fingers, for a
distance of 40(> kilometers. "We were
both soaked arid nearly blinded by the
escaping oil and were compelled to re
duce our speed. This accounts for our
bad position in the race. Ido not know
what became of the other Americans.
Dlngley completed the first lap and
Tracy three laps; but neither has re
turned to La Champ. None of the
American motor cars participating In
the race was sufficiently speedy or ap
propriate for the course and there was
also much trouble with the tires.
Otherwise we would have been better
placed."
GHA3IPION SCHAEFEE
DEFEATED BY SPINKS
Coast Man Takes the Billiard
i. Laurels of the
World.
...Jake Schaefer. the champion billiard
player of the world, was defeated last
night at Morley's parlors by William
Spinks, the Pacific Coast champion. The
final score was 400 to 366. Spinks won out
by making a run of 33. -after falling
down several. times on easy chances. .-
-\u25a0 \u25a0 Schaf er : did not arrive in town . till lat a
hi the afternoon and was not in his best
form, but at that Sptnks played phenom
enal billiards during the earlier innings of
the game. Splnks started out with a lead
and soon was more than 100 points ahead
of Schaefer. He made a high run of 177.
and seemed to be winning easily, while
Schaefer was unable to get Into the going.
But in the nineteenth inning Schaefer
began' to rally and closed in on Splnks
by making the . highest : run of the night.
IS2.- Spinks was playing in poor form at
this time and seemed overanxious to win.
It looked as though Schaefer would man
age to run out on the Pacific Coast ex
pert, but Spinks got a start in the twen
tieth - Inning and ran out ; from the 353
mark, leaving his ran unfinished.
It was Schaef er's first appearance ta
this city in fifteen years, and he was
warmly greeted by an immense v crowd.
He made some phenomenal shots which
brought forth rounds of applause. The
game was ref ereed by Chick "Wright. This
evening Schaefer will meet Ben Say lor in
a match game at Morley's. The billiard
fans are very \u25a0 anxious to see Schaefer
and Wright come together, and an effort
will be made to arrange a match between
the crack young amateur and the cham
pion of the world. ; *

BANK'S AFFAIRS
BEFORE COURT
Creditors Ask That Devlin;
the Operators of Topeka,
Be Declared a Bankrupt
OFFICERS IN TROUBLE
Han(lling of Deposits Just
Prior to Failure May Lead
o to Action by Government
TOPEKA, Ivans., July s.â The af
fairs of the First National Bank, which
closed Its doors on Monday, assumed
a different phase.to-day, when the Kan
sas City, creditors petitioned the United
States Court ; to declare Charles J Devlin
a ; bankrupt. ' The petition was made
returnable' on July 20 and : its effect is
to prevent any } further: attachments of
the Devlin property and to .set aside
real estate "valued at' s7oo,ooo; which
Devlin : on Monday, transferred to .the
failed --, bank. The action does not | af -,
feet S the : life \ Insurance, 1 iwhlch is . In.

the - bank, y; ?fi r '*ti---j.H'-~Â£u
.- Devlin's business, associates declare
that he is far from a bankrupt and
still -Insist that the bank will be en
abled to pay dollar for dollar.
;"i Receiver who began an ex
amination-of the books of the bank to
day, that It "would be' ten
days before he could make a statement
of the bank's condition.*. He announced
that it was dbubtfurif the State, which
had $500,000 in the bank, would be con
sidered v preferred; creditor. Governor
Hoch, late to-day, announced that "the
executive council would to-morrow con
sider the action of State Treasurer Kel
ley in. placing so ; much of the State's
money ; In 'one bank.\. ' \u25a0:
There was no show of a run to-day
on any of the other banks, all fear ap
parently having been allayed. It was
estimated to-day that,J346,000 had been
withdrawn on: Monday, by - frightened
depositors from the -Central 'National,
the Bank of Topeka. the State Savings
and, the Merchants' National banks. Of
this amount 80 per cent was in checks
of less than $100 and was distributed
among ISOO depositors.
Receiver Bradley of the , First Nation
al Bank says there is some doubt as to
.the^legality. of- the action of the officers
of the bank in making, special' deposits
of ; all money., paid in on .Friday and
Saturday; and not 1 turning the money
in with the regular accounts. Thldac :
tion was taken In order to save the de
positors and at the' same 7 time riot cre
ate alarm by refusing to receive de
posits. Tho law: makes It a crlmiaal
act for officers of a bank to receive de
posits ' when I they have reason to sus
pect that ! the . bank is unsafe. On Fri
day and Saturday j all . deposits received
were laid aside to be -returned 'to the
depositors untouched If the bank
should fall. ,
\% "This matter has been submitted to
the department at Washington," Brad
ley said to-night, o ''The officers there
will have to decide whether or not the
ofllcers of the bank had the right to
do as they did and whether or. not this
action releases them. from responsibil
ity for taking the deposits.":
.The opinion of business men -is that
the bank- will be able .to > pay .nearly if
not quite 100 cents on .the- dollar, but
that there is little possibility of Its be
ing able to resume: business. -
KANSAS CITY. July';s.â The credit
ors' committee of the C.J.; Devlin es
tate' to-day drafted; an 7; address, which
was immediately forwarded r t6 all cred
itors of the I Devlin properties, asking
that they meet at Kansas City, on July
31 to considerthe situation and urging
that In the meantime no legal action
bo taken. V :
Alexander New, of the firm of attor
neys for the creditors,^ who to-day filed
bankruptcy proceedings ,at Topeka.
said that the situation was so compli:
catedthat ; it- would be impossible to
mako\ny intelligent forecast as to the
final result. It was absolutely neces
sary, ho said, to -take someV steps to
preserve the assets and prevent prefer
ences by attachment or otherwise, and
for this reason the bankruptcy proceed
ings' were broujrht.

ASASKA PACKERS' ASSOCIATION.
Oprntnff Price* .Vnined and Market
Conditions Stated.
The J. K. Anr.sby Company, general dls
tubur.fjg agents for the United States of the
Alatka Packers' Association, announce opÂ«n
;zs prices en the association 1905 pack Alaska
salmon as follows:
A:aska Red. 1-lb tail cans $1 CO per dozen
Alaska King, 1-lb tall cans 85 per dozen
Aiatka Cohoe, 1-lb tall cans... 66 rer dozen
Alaska P;r.k. 1-lb tall cans 75 per Cozen
In addition they state that all grades of
Alaska Salmon of 190* association packing
are entirely sold cut. with the exception of a
limited quantity of Alaska Red.
The scant supply, the strong and growing
demand for spot goods and the almost abso
lutely bare markets are the causes for thli
early naming of prices. Most of the Salmon of
the 1905 pack will on arrival at once be
delivered to Jobbers, as large orders subject
to these opening prices have been booked from
e!I parts cf the world.
" The Salmon trade in the- Orient. Australia,
South America and the United Kingdom Is in
excellent condition, with stocks low. Llwr-
I>ooJ putlic warehouse returns of June 1, ?905,
rfcow 550,084. cases en hand, as against 655.161
cases on the corresponding date last year, anl
<-^4.TC9 cases en June 1. 1903. \u25a0 Reports from
London and other centers show the came pro
portionate deficiency.
\u25a0 In tho United States, on account of the
backward season (although stocks In jobbers'
hands ere low), the markets have been rather
dull, but during June sales have been abnor
>n;a!!y heavy and demands are setting in with
â¢f. rush.
Favorable news has already been received
'rcrn all of the association canneries. ThÂ»
vessels had no ice to contend with this year,
â¢-verything was found In good shape and can
making ar.3 other neceesary preparations will
be eoirpletfcd in ample time, before the run of
Salr.'.cn sets In.
Many of the Pacific Coast Salmon canneries,
which could rot be economically operated, are
closed thi* year, and, notwithstanding the
rrcbable heavier output of sockeyea, the total
jack is not likely to bÂ« over the average. The
Sacramento River canneries have not put tip
a single case tr.it> seeson. and on the Colum
bia River. thÂ« run being: light, the canners
are getting but few Salmon, as the fresh flih
dealers are paying prohibitive prices for all
good-sized fish.
The Salmon canning companies on the Co
lumbia RivÂ«r are all heavily oversold and
Efaort deliveries are sow a positive assurance.

I\EW TOIUC. July 3.â ln *plte of a' relapse
j, price* late in tie day there waa no mli
ttklnif the aetreoiv* ttrength Â«sf . the force*
behind to-day" \u25a0 continuation of speculation la
w â¢tocks. Tbe valuta* of dealing* rose well over
* Monday's unexpectedly larre totals. As to
now xtr the stimulated advance la prices, has
*vicaee6ed In attracting an \u25a0 outside demand
ert!matea and opinions vary. The market waa
particularly trader thÂ» Influence' of â¢ organized
r '-~*s which bare condncted the present ad*
vance for its completion. It was believed.
In fact, that there had been some influential
recruits to the ranks of the market leadera.
The large congestion of the dealings In special
stocks, the orderly manner in wnich opera
tions were shifted from one quarter to an
other and the skill displayed in the selection
oi stocks in these movements with a view to
Influence on sentiment and to help celling to
advantage of stocks previously advanced leri
no room for doubt -of the continued control of\
the market by organized leadership. The con
tinuance of maneuvers of stocks accumulated
in the course of the late rise is not completzd,
although the digestive process was going on'
actively to-day. NeÂ«s matter was disregarded
at the outset, so far as it was adverse to
the campaign for the advance. The trouble
precipitated among a chain of Western banks
by the Topeka bank failure is of a kind
which would upset the stock market In some
of its moods, but it seems to have been totally
disregarded by the present market, and this
notwithstanding the widespread discussion
given to the present great volume of bank
loans outstanding and the importance of the
maintenance of perfect conridence in. their
quality. Much more Importance was attached
in the view of the active speculative party
t> the relaxing tone of the money market as
an evidence of the release of funds accumu
lated for July disbursements. The bond mar
ket showed little effect from any deal foi
investment. There was, however, some ac
tivity in new issues of bonds convertible into
those stocks which have been made active in
the present movement. The resumption of the
gold export movement late in the day dis
couraged the flagging efforts to keep up prices.
The definite announcement of the offering here
of a one-third installment, or $50,000,000 of
the Japanese loan, the withdrawal un the
â¢15th of Government deposits and the per
sistence of the Parts .demand for gold cloud
the future of the money market. The rush
to sell on the gold announcement shook the
market badly and left remnants Of gains In
only a few of the strongest stocks. Losses
of 1 to 2 points resulted for some of the lead
ir, stocks.
Bonds were steady. Total sales, par value,
$0,386,000.

Japanese Bonds and Cotton.
The New Tork wires of E. F. Hutton & Co.
yesterday said:
The $150,000,000 of 414 per cent Japanese
bonds of the new loan, now being offered. Is a
eecond Hen on the tobacco monopoly of the
country an* is being made on turns precisely
the came as the first Issue. The terms are
at 57% and interest. This new loan not only
provides an additional large amount of funds
for Japan in case the war is continued, but
will supply the country with over f 100.C00.000
of cash In London and New York and $200.
000.000 In surplus at Ik'iklo and give it a suffi
ciently large surplus to take up its internal
t> per cent loan.
COTTON â To-day's market was active and
erratic. The large advance of the \u25a0 last ' few
days has somewhat demoralized trade condi
tions, and it will take a short time to adjust
them to the advance. The Government report
issued to-day Indicated a crop below normal,
and If this is borne out cotton will sell much
higher V
A brokerage house says: "Twelve cents we
regard as inevitable in this market. This Is
not based upon any speculation or any specula
tive buying of contracts, but simply because
the demand will exceed the supply in the next
eighteen months."

Dried Fruit 1m Sevr York.
Mall advices from New. York say:
"A better feeling is developing In this mar
ket as a result of an increasing disposition
on the part o* buyers to enter into negotia
tions for future supplies in the - principal
staple lines. . While orders were much more
numerous yesterday Â» than heretofore this sea
pen, they Involved no large blocks. Buyers are
reluctant to anticipate their : wants to the
same extent -as In former years, their unfor
tunate experience of falling markets after they
had loaded up in paÂ«t seasons tending to a
feeling, of extreme conservatism, even In the
face of vnquet tlonably short crops In rome
varieties and* 1 the probability â¢of - a material
advance in prlceg on the*e. Already there is
a strong upward . tendency of the market for
future Prunes. Advices from- the coast Indi
cate that the crop of Peaches -Is turning out
to be much lighter than anticipated and the
tendency of the market on that variety is up
ward. Buyer?, however, seem Inclined to re
siet the advance and are not taking, hold
with the freedom expected, though the de
mand as above Intimated Is improving. The
distributing trade does not seem to like the
samples of Apricots to far submitted very well,
the fruit, while bright In color, being thin
and small. â¢ " Still orders for this variety also
are more numerous than they were a week ago
and the market is quite firm. Neither buyers
nor coast sellers item much '- inclined ;to do
business in future Raisins subject to approval
of prices when made; and the 'sellers ceem to
be In no hurry to announce opening prices on
the coming crop. Spot seeded Raisins are in
limited supply: and with increasing - Inquiry
the market is very firm."

BABY DROWNS IN MOTHER'S ARMS
BEFORE RESCUER COMES.
Lighter San Lorenzo
sprang a leak while" be
ing towed from Point
San Pablo to Fort Point
yesterday and the family
of Captain Peter Larsen
of 13 14 Dc Haro street
was precipitated into the
bay, drowning the infant
child- Thomas Moore,
an employe on the scow,
helped the captain and
children to a place of
.temporary safety and
then sprang into the
water and held Mrs.
Larscn above the waves
until help arrived.
Lighter Starts to Sink
and Family Falls
Into Water.
Thomas Moore^s Proven
Hero by Noble Work
of Rescue.
Another tale of bay drowning and
heroic rescue was brought to the Harbor
Emergency Hospital, yesterday evening
at 7:10 o'clock when seven occupants of
the brick schooner-scow San" Lorenzo
landed at the Mission-street wharf. "The
dead is Elwin, the four-month-old daugh
ter of' Captain Peter Larsen of J314
De Haro street, who slipped from her
mother's arms after the family was pre
cipitated into the water.
The rescued were: Captain Peter Lar
sen. his wife and their childrenâ Henry,
age eleven years; Myrtle, age seven
years; Walter, age five years; Mabel, age
three years, and Thomas Moore.
The Larsens had been on a picnic up
San Pablo Bay and were returning with
a load of brick bound to Fort Point in
tow of two of Crowley's launches in
charge of Peter Flgari and Nicholas
Dagvani. The craft listed and sprang a
leak In the entrance to Raccoon Straits.
Larsen tried to pump it out, but was un
successful. The rowboat tied alongside
was used to place the family in, but It,
too, was found to be leaking. Thomas
Moore-, who was at the wheel on the San
l/jrer.zo, saw the predicament of the fam
ily and hastened to get the father and
children from the water-soaked shell to
a place where they could be picked up
by the hands on the launches. But be
fore they were all safely landed Mrs.
Larsen and the baby girl fell over the
side. Moore jumped In the water after
them and succeeded in holding her up
until they were rescued by the launches,
although the child was drowned.
Captain Larsen placed his family in the
frail rowboat with the intention of get
ting away from the scow before It sank,
but no sooner did they all get seated
than it, too, was found to be leaking.
The children attempted to bail it out,
but the inrushing water was rapidly fill
ing the boat when Moore came to the
side and pulled the family back to the
scow in a position where they could be
easily picked up by the launches.
Mrs. Larsen was unable to get back to
the scow, and \u25a0with her youngest child
in her arms she fell into the water.
Father and children became panic
stricken when they saw her falL To the
coolheadedness ' of Moore they owe her
rescue, although the child was lost. . . :
While the remainder of the family
watched and hoped for the safety of their
beloved, Moore swam to her side and
held her head above the water. As he
came up to her he caw the Infant girl
float by dead as it Is supposed to have
been smothered in the drowning grasp of
its mother. Mrs. Larsen was not told ot
the fact last night that her child was not
rescued with her, and she thinks she
saved its life when the launch' dragged
Moore and herself from the bay.
The launch in charge of Figari cut the
towline and put about in an attempt to
save the lives of the capsized, but the
men on Dagvani's launch were unable to
get in a position to do the life-saving act.
During this time the father and children
were swaying with the unsteady and
rapidly sinking scow and when pulled oft
they fainted from exhaustion.
Dagvani and two men were left to tow
the brick-laden craft to the nearest
beach, while the other launch steamed
for the Harbor Hospital with the sub
merged victims. After they were resusci
tated it was nearly an hour before they
were able to coherently tell of the ac
cident.
Moore has a reputation along the water
front as a life saver and long distance
ewlmmer, as he made the trip through
the water from Goat Island after jump-
Ing from the old schooner Sea .Breeze
fourteen years ago. He was then picked
up when 200 yards from chore by the
terry Piedmont.

Prominent Man From Hono- j

While at -the Occidental!
Z. G.'Dunn, said. to be a prominent of
ficial of the Pacific Mall Steamship Com
pany at Honolulu, began his celebration
of ithe Fourth of July in lively style,
and by the time iaylight of the fifth
had 'dawned he had had several fights :
and acquired 'a*>... state of mind that [
verged upon What is commonly called |
the y d. t/s.. The \u25a0 first encounter took j
place in the office of the Occidental Ho
tel,'where he and his family are stay
ing.; In the melee it took one porter and
two outsiders to effectually subdue the
pugnacious/Mr. Dunn.
After his bout Dunn left the hotel
and, still thirsting for gore", became In
volved with two bootblacks at Sutter
and Montgomery streets. They were
Just going. to work. .After being pum
meled by the shine artists Mr. Dunn is
reported to. have fled up Market street,
bumping -into early- morning pedestri-.
ans and knocking others out of his path.
Tiring of this exercise, he later return
ed to the hotel, bearing sundry cuts and
bruises as souvenirs of his affrays, then
noisily went to his room.' There he went
to bed and late last night was sending
out: bellboys for drugs.
Dunn arrived at the hotel on the first
of T July. Although ' from . Honolulu, \ he
registered as from this city. . He was
assigned to rooms 91 and 93 and noth
ing was heard from him until the night
of,, the ' Fourth. - The pyrotechnlcal dis
play, bred emulation and Dunn was fre
quently noticed, making his wafto the
bar. An early alifm of fire .was turned
in:, on' the morning of the fifth,' and
Dunn, Vwith many, other guests, turned
out- to see the blaze. .' He was minus his
shirt* and collar and on his return his
condition .was : first noticed. The hotel
porter,' Tony, attempted to persuade him
to go to his room quietly, but he turned
on Tony, and now a pair of trousers will
be one of the items of his bill when it Is
presented. \u25a0' Two , passers-by, attracted
by' the : struggle, responded, rand after
subduing ! the crazed . man; allowed him
to. depart. Then Dunn began his sen
