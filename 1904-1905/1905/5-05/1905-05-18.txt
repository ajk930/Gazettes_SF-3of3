retary, both of whom are familiar with
the case and with the documents which
have come to the State Department, were
called into conference/ Following it
Bowen went to Judge Penfield's office
and had a long talk with him.
Hay turned the mlnsingr papers In the

Isoomts a /ew days before the" latter
ntarted on hfs trip to the Pacific Coast
about two months ago. <
The investigation which. has been un^
der way for, the -; last few days has
taken a more serious -phase, and :it is
understood that the administration will
make, a deep and thorough investiga
tion into. the case, leaving no stone un
turned to get the truth.. It is now pre
dicted that the investigation cannot be
completed this week or even next week.
One man says he would hot be sur
prised if it should run on for" a month
or more. This indicates very plainly
that Secretary Taft intends to get to
the' bottom of it all. t ; I ;

Dr. Crawford has had a cold for sev

will be able to start for Chicago.
As regards' the ChicagbV municipality.
Dr. Crawford say's "he recognizes that in
Chicago ; there may be powerful rival in
terests, which will clash, but if Chicago
is determined. to have sound city govern
ment he is with" Chicago." ' \u25a0' . '
LONDON, May 17.â Another great stride
has been taken in municipal ; ownership.
The London' County Council has decided
to buy the North. London tramways and
electrify them. The Council will spend
$93,000,000 on the . project, which . will add
another ,100 â¢ miles to the s lines - already
owned and managed by the- people -of
London and Glasgow. . *;/
Dr. Robert Crawford, - whom Mayor
Dunne has" Invited to Chicago, in speak
ing of municipal ownership, said to-night:
j "During all my^life I have devoted my
self to the consideration of the .problem:
Jiow. can a municipal institution be' safe :
ly and sanely developed to secure, as, far
as possible, advancement of the comfort,
convenience , and prosperity | of /.citizens
without regard to class, distinctions? 83
have had a .belief concerning"' life, in "great,
cities that ;the "prosperity, and > happiness
of :' their, inhabitants, largely, depend -upon
â¢ the. i application 'â to ,\u25a0 vast>'-JpprLu|a tions. "/of \u25a0
souncJr ;â¢ ' municipal i': "socla.lism--sociail3m
which aims '[not at breaking dqwn^lndi
vidual;, effort,"; but :. works for the "creatioft
bf/tho .best," possible conditions j arid^for
the .exercise of 'individual.'effort." * -
But ail this is to be changed during the
rest of Mr. Roosevelt's term. Although
every railroad company in the United
States has made big efforts to get the
honor and advertisement of carrying the
President, hereafter the President ex
pects to pay for it all out of his own
pocket.
\u25a0 It it- suspected that the President bore
the expense of the bear hunting trip com
pleted a week ago. This is inferred from
the fact that the special train which car
ried him to Colorado did not wait for him.
It was not at the disposal of the party
tvhich accompanied the President. Here
tofore xi-h^cever the President of the
United States has gone on an outing, the
train which bore him remained on a. side
ti'ttk ond was at his disposal Â«ver>%min
ute of the time. Of course. If the Presi
dent were paying for his transportation
this time, as is supposed, he would have
to pay the $50 a da^ that it costs to keep
a Pullman at one's disposal.
Heretofore the trips by the President
have been made at the expense of the
Pennsylvania Company, as a rule. That
company has supplied everything. It has
been most lavish in its preparations for
the* entertainment of its chief guest and
his friends. It is said the Pullman Com
pany has always insisted that the railroad
company should reimburse it 'for the ex
pense incurred and that the company has
done so. The Pennsylvania, nine times
out of ten. has been the road that car
ried the President out of Washington,
no matter where he desired to go. Gen
erally it has been able to carry him to
the point he vrished to reach, but some
times it had to deliver the train to
another road. Even in cases of that kind,
there was no change of cars. . The result
of its generosity was much free advertis
ing for the road and to that account the
expense, was charged.
"WASHINGTON, May 17.â President
Roosevelt will accept no more free rides
froni cither railroad or sleeping car com
panies. Hereafter, when he goes on a
trip he will pay his way. If he has guests
he will pay for them. The only trip lie
eoxt has in mmd â tn fact, the only trip
he expects to make during the rest of
bis Term of omce â is one to Florida and
Arkansas. These are the only States he
has not visited, and it is his purpose to
visit them in October.

Sjieaker Cannon is so angry that he has
decided not to accompany Secretary TaXt
and party to the Philippines.
"LTncle Joe" Cannon is just as mad as
the. other high protectionists. He arrived
in town to-night and added this to tbe
party flame:
"I do not know the necessity for the
purchase of supplies made or produced
abroad. We have here in the United
States the greatest market in the world,
making one-third of the whole manufac
tured produce of the civilized world. I
take it for granted that 'all the supplies
needed should be, and tvIII be, the product
of our own manufacture wherever prac
ticable."
"The triumph of free trade has come
quickly. If the Government can go to the
cheapest market for the material for its
canal, why should not the individual be
allowed to bo there for the material for
his house?" â¢
"The announcement of such a policy is
to be regretted. It seems probable that
we shall have to employ coolie labor in
the construction of the canal, but we
have never supposed that it would be
necessary to buy material made by the
pauper labor of Europe."
Senator Carmack of Tennessee (Demo
crat) said: /

Representative Joseph Sibley of Penn
sylvania, said:
Wlnthrop L. Marvin, secretary of the
Merchant Marine Commission, called upon
Secretary Taft to-day and said, later:
"I have dropped in to your political
luneral, Mr. Secretary," said Scctt '
"Ycu can't come tÂ» my funeral with
out bringing flowers, and I see no flow
ers." replied the Secretary.
At the same time, Taft said that he
would stand by the President's action to
the end, funeral or no funeral. He told
his callers there was no reason why the
Government should pay for two ships
hero a sum that would buy four ships in
Europe.
Senators Scott and Burrows, both high
tariff Republicans, called on Secretary
Taft to-day and criticized the administra
iion'6 policy.
At ; the same time many protests are
coming toj especially frcm American ship
builders.
Representative Dalzell of Pennsylvania
came out in an interview to-night scor
ing the action in most vigorous terms.
He called it "free trade" and "a sight
for gods and men," and said that Con
gress had never acted and never intended
to act
This frank assumption of responsibility
has not quelled the rebellion within the
lines of the Republican party. On the
contrary, the family row continued to
grow to-day. Criticism of the action is
riot entirely outside of the Cabinet. There
has been plain talk to-day about "such
a policy, if persisted in, disrupting the
Reiublican party" or at least making
difficult the path of the next Republican
candidate. .
At any rate the question was up to
Congress. That body had an opportunity
lo act once and would have an oppor
tunity to act aeain.

of his callers who talked with him on the

will then be agreed by the 1 team owners
and the Teamsters'. Joint Council that the
demand of the team owners to make, de

arbitration is to concern only the Team

in an official sense. Pending the decision
of this board of arbitration the strike ) is <
to be called off, and such members of the

their old positions will return to work. V
This will end the strike entirely with

schooner Atlantic leading the way headed

$5000 ;- cup offered , by,. EinpeVor; William of

A quarter^of a -mile Tastern of the At

Ailsa, which was having a hot brush with
the German schooner Hamburg, while all

ping the. Philadelphia ' schooner Hilde
'Earde: Next was the \u25a0 Endymionj holder
of the trans-Atlantic yachting record. Al
most;a mile -astern of the Atlantic and
more than half a mile astern of the En

de-Lis. Strung out behind 'were the Amer
ican bark -Apache, the British topsail
schooner Sunbeam , and five miles astern
of the, leader the American three-masted
schooner Utowana: Bringing up the rear,
was; the . British clipper ship .Valhalla.
These two had ' been delayed by a bad
start. --V-
Leaden skies, - low-hanging, mist-laden
clouds and a r moderate east wind were
the : unfavorable conditions under which
the great ocean race was. started, and the
three ; big squire-rigged vessels were
handicapped at â¢ the : very start, :for at
beating to windward in a light air their
spreading canvases and bulging topsails
were not to be compared with the' hard
fitting fore and aft canvas of the trim
schooners. Weather prophets declared it
not unlikely that -the racers were jn for
a day or. two more of moderate head
winds. If the forecast be f ulttlled nothing
but half a Bale of wind, from astern will
save the big Valhalla from defeat. '
START AN IMPOSING OJfE.
Despite the lowering weather conditions
the start of the great and "heterogeneous
: fleet was inspiring. , After the ; postpone
ment of the day before the yachts lay in
their anchors within the shelter of Sandy
Hook last night. The fog of the day pre
vious K had lifted -considerably, but still
hung low and obscured the vision beyond
a few milesf The German schooner Ham
burg was the first to leave the anchorage
and pass out through Gedneys Channel.
The Valhalla, Ailsa and Thistle followed,
and before 10:30 the fleet was streaming In
tow out â¢ through the \u25a0 channel toward the
lightship and past the" stranded Cunard
. liner Caronia, whose passengers crowded
;to the rails to "witness the procession.
; The "Committee â¢, boat;' with - Commander
Hebbinghaus of the German -navy, Com
mander/. H. .H..-Hosley, -of ; the United'
States Navy ;~ Oliver E..'Cromwell,; New
â¢bury D." Lawtoni r H. Deb ' Parsons and
! Edward H.W ales of the New York Yacht
Club on board, : anchored \u25a0 an , eighth of \ a
mile- east of Sandy; Hook lightship and
established the starting line between them,
shortly after 11 o'clock. A fleet of yachts
and ships began to assemble.. As the
racers began . to arrive they were towed
to" the north' and windward' of the start
ing line. '.'.;.-.
Most of the schooners soon after reach
ing the starting , line dropped their tows,
set'their sails and began to wheel about
in and out through the fleet like \ high
stepping horses/displaying their paces for
the admiring spectators. Meanwhile the
wide top sails of the Valhalla were' un
furled arid sheeted home, and . one after
another the tall top sails,' topgallant sails,
royals and staysails of the square-rigged
craft were, spread to the soft breeze. V
The court would not regard as controlling
either the large amount of money involved or
the fact .that the claimants added the duties
to the price of their goods. But it is worth
while to point out (as accentuating the great
importance of this case) that the refunds
called for under the decision ot the court will
reach the eujn of (7.000, 009, and, that this ..vast
sum will |be paid . in large part to. claimants,
many of them aliens, who as public records'
show,' were, on the whole, opposing rather than
supporting the authority of the United States."
Without magnifying the case it is possible,
I think,- that while the opinion of the court
strikes down only the tariff on merchandise,
from the' United States, the legality of the en
tire structure of clvjl government after the
ratification of the treaty is involved and may
be denied hereafter relative to other features
not now presented or foreseen if the. court ad
here unqualifiedly to the logic of this opinion.
It is difficult to see why, because the ex
ercise of the war power was initiated under a
foreign war. it ceases at the end of that war
and does not extend on into a much more se
rious war, simply because the territory was
domestic To entertain this view, it seems to
me. is to disregard the doctrines laid down in
the Civil War cases,- which unqualifiedly sus
tain the exercise of executive power for which
the Government contends' in dealing with an
Insurrectionary war in domestic territory. The
President consciousVy and -intentionally im
poeed the order on the new war and was not
misled into unknowingly giving an authority
in blank.
In his petition Holt recalls the fact
that the decision was based upon the
fourteen diamond rings case, but contends
that the cases are fundamentally differ
ent. The court held that the President's
order expired by its own terms, when the.
war with Spain came to an end, but the
Solicitor General says:
WASHINGTON, May 17.â A petition of
the Government for a rehearing in the
cases of the United States vs. Peabody &
Co. and the United States vs. Warner;
Barnes & Co., involving the construc
tion of the President's Philippine tariff
order of July 12, IS9S, was submitted to
the Supreme Court of the United States
to-day. The petition was presented by
Solicitor General Hoyt and was supported
Jn a brief by Attorney General Moody.
The case was decided a few weeks ago
adversely to the contentions of the United
States, and the decision was regarded by
the Government as calculated to impose
a heavy burden on the treasury. The At
torney General concludes his statement
as follows: \u25a0'\u25a0*'
The reaaan lor the importance to the Gov-r
e-rnmer.t of the rround on which this case is
to\ be decided, if it must be decided in favot
of the complainants, is that there are doubtless
claims amounting to more than a million dol
lars, on which euit was not brought BSfore
July J, 1302, the date of the ratifying act, but
on it cults have been and will be brought in
view of the present decision of the court. Fo*
these reasons we think it of the utmost im
portance to the Government that an oppor
tunity should be given for a reargument. in
which the question of construction and ratifi
cation may be riven a much fuller considera
tion, in view of all the hl6tory of this legis
lation, than, as it is respectfully submitted, it
has heretofore had. ;

ST. PETERSBURG. May 17.â Very
disquieting reports were in circulation
here to-day about Vice Admiral Rojest
vensky's health. It was said that he
had telegraphed to the Emperor that
It was impossible for him to proceed.
An evening paper printed a report that
that admiral had suffered a nervous
breakdown.
The admiral suffered from kidney
trouble before leaving Kronstadt and
throughout the long voyage to the Far
East he was so ill at times that he had
to be carried about on a stretcher; but
the Russian commandex stuck bravely
to his post. If he is now compelled on
the eve of battle to give up his com
mand the Admiralty would regard it as
little short of a national misfortune.

ST. PETERSBURG,- May, 17.â There "is

rial rescript issued yesterday modifying
the restrictive decrees in nine of the west

Poles greater freedom' for acquiring
farming lands and purchasing landed
properties and ; industrial premises and
giving permission to introduce the Polish
and Lithuanian languages in the primary
and secondary schools where the major
ity "of the inhabitants are non-Russian.
Almost at one sweep the whole burden of
the vexatious restrictive' laws in Poland
and the Baltic provinces has been re
moved and the privileges for which the
natives have been fighting for years are
restored, the assemblies of the Polish no
bles are re-established and all the harsh
administrative measures .'introduced at

ST. PETERSBURG, May IS, 2:40 a. m.â
With a suspicious stoppage of dispatches
from Manchuria and a strong possibility
that Vice Admiral Rojestvensky has cut
his last communications with home and
set forth on the final stage of his journey
to hie goal, either Togo or Vladivostok,
keen Interest is manifested in naval and
military circles here on the twofold field
of war. Though the Admiralty, which
has been completely silent since the ad
vent cf Rojestvensky In the Chinese Sea,
publishes no dispatches, the conviction is
growing that the united squadrons de
parted from the Annam coast im
mediately after their juncture, and naval
officials are anxiously expecting news of
the first skirmishes between scouts of the
hostile fleets.
Captain Clado confirms the statement
that the vessels of both squadrons are
equipped with apparatus for cleaning
their bottoms at sea. He said to-day that
It was entirely possible for Vice Admiral
Nebcgatoft to put the last finishing
touches to the vessels of his division dur
ing the mysterious interval when they
were lost to sight before passing the
Straits of Malacca.
â¢ The press was informed late last night
that Vice Admiral Biiileff, now com
mandant at Kronstadt, would be sent to
Vladivostok.
On the military side, the indications are
that events are rapidly shaping for the
preliminary stage of another great bat
tle. The Russian army has been refitted
and is ready for action, and it is asserted
that General Unevitch Is not the man to
waste days In inaction.

ST. LOUIS. May 17. â Just as the
Baptist contention was 'about to ad
journ to-d&y Rev. Dr. CushingT, presi
dent oft the Baptist University at Han
coon, India, was : stricken while occu
pying: a seat upon the rostrum and fell
dying on the floor.; While waiting. for
the arrival of an ambulance a prayer
was offered -for Dr. Cushing, the dele
gates standing with , bowed heads. Be
fore the arrival of physicians Dr. Cush
ing v died.. He had been carried from
the speaker's stage to the vestibule of
the 'Third'jÃaptist Church, where the
convention" is being held, and cushions
from the pews had; been "hastily pro
cured to make a temporary resting
place/for the stricken divine. Dr. Cush
ing did not regain consciousness.
>! The; organization of a permanent
body to be known as the General Con
vention lof ' Baptists of North America
was perfected to-day by the , election
of the' following officers: President.^E.'
W. Stephens of Columbia, Mo. ; - secre
retary.' J. J3. Prestrldge of Kentucky;
treasurer,' H. Lirk Porter t of Pennsyl
vania, and an' executive committee, one
of whose members is C. H. Hill of Cal
ifornia.
After the business incident to the or
ganization â¢of the ' general : convention
had been concluded , Rev. Dr. L. Call
Barnes, D. D., of Worcester, Mass., In
an address on "The Unity of the Bap
tist Mission.'.' made what Is regarded
by;his fellowÃaptists-as a radical ut
terance on the question of infant bap
tism, which is opposed by the Baptist
teachings.\ ' ; .
"We have insisted." said Dr. Barnes,
.''on Individual instances of collective
obedience to God and so ". have had to
insist on baptism .by personal action
instead of baptism by proxy. But at
the mouth of the whole world's schol
arship and at the^ point of the bayonet
of common sense the forces of infant
baptism * have been turned until there
is nothing left for them but an act of
infant" dedication and the sooner we
turn to publicly dedicate our children
the sooner we shall have taken away
the last prop of pedo-baptism.".

"The total Issue of bonds was $17.
174.000. of which J4.673.600 have been
Bold." said Clerk Fay of the Board of
Supervisors. "The bonds remaining un
sold are long term bonds, running from
ten to forty years, and are considered
valuable as an investment, paying 3sÂ£
per cent free of taxes. None of these
have "been sold cs yet, as the city Is not
prepared to use the money to be real
ized from their sale. The indications
are that but few of them will be placed
on the market during the next fiscal
year, as it. is not intended to pay inter
est for. the money until it is actually
required."
City Attorney Long is of the opinion
that the law eigned by Governor Hig
gins of New York permitting the sale
of municipal bonds issued'by San Fran
cisco to New York banks will result
in the eale of a large block of the bonds
remaining unsold. When the bonds
were first put on the market last year
the leading bankers of New York in
formed the Board of Supervisors that
they would purchase large amounts of
the bonds if the law would permit them
to do so. When Long was in New York
last February he had the law placing
Ean Francisco bonds on par with those
of favored cities introduced at Albany.
The law was passed and signed by
Higgins.

Mahoney, accused by -Mrs. Annie Burns
of 717 Fifth avenue of having made an
assault upon her on the evening of
April 4, was finished and decision re
served until \u25a0' next Friday evening.'; The
defense offered an abundance of testi
mony detrimental to the j character of
the complaining witness' 1 and there
seems to be a question in the minds of
the Commissioners -as to whether < the
policeman is not the victim .of a con
spiracy.
Before the meeting . adjourned - the
license of the Art saloon at. 1410 Mar

of the proprietor, Peter McGuire/ that
no machine displaying indecent pic

the premises.
Mayor Schmltz attended the meeting
of the Police Commissioners last night
and at his' suggestion a resolution was
passed that will accord liquor dealers

Norwegians Mark an Important Anni
versary In Their Country's History
With Elaborate Ceremonies.
Norway's day of independence- was
celebrated in fitting fashion by the
Norwegian clubs of this city, last even
ing at two different places. The Fram,
Nora and Viking clubs combined for
their celebration at Golden Gate . Hall,'
where a varied programme of enter
tainment was offered. The hall was
decked with a profusion of the flags
of America' and . JJorway entwined to
gether. , P. O. Aune was president ' of
the occasion. Addresses were made by
Faste Svendsen' and ' David Starr Jor
dan. Miss Ingeborg Resh-Petersen'
andCarolus Lundine rendered vocal se
lections, J. M. Olsen's orchestra sup
plied the instrumental music and the
national anthem was sung by the audi
ence.. A supper and dancing followed.'
The Norwegian Singing Society held
its celebration' at Saratoga HalL About
the hall were displayed the national
colors of America and ' Norway. I : The
exercises were of an interesting order
and highly appreciated by a large au
dience. Pastor P. N. : Melby delivered
the oration. The society sang, a num
ber of choruses in rattling, good style
and evoked great enthusiasm. .Orches
tra music was furnished by J. S. Lindt
ner's band. A little dramatic idyl, "Til
Saeters," was capitally played by ama
teurs. -?;^^,
celebrate: independence
day with festivitd3s
"When the diplomatic history of this
epoch shall be written two names will
shine forth more brilliantly than all those
who Have contributed to make itâ those
of Theophile Delcasse and of John Hay."
Watterson made a characteristic speech,
which, after a glowing tribute to General
Porter, took up the achievements of Paul
Jones. His closing words, hurling back
the taunts of the British press that Jones
was a pirate, aroused great enthusiasm.
"It waÂ« the hands of Paul Jones." said
Watterson, "which first loosened the flag
which we adore and which carried this
flag defiant and triumphant- into English
waters, Into the Irish Sea and into the
North Seaâ yea, into St. Georges Chan
nel; not merely bearding the lion in his
den, but coming away with those same
hands stuffed with indisputable trophies,
with actual and visible fragments of his
mane and tail. I do not wonder they call
him a pirate; but if 'he was a pirate.
Washington -was a highwayman and
Franklin a lobster."
"Whatever measure of success has been
attained 13 largely attributable to the
able direction and effective policy of our
home administration and the full support
and confidence it has Invariably given its
representatives. It is some satisfaction to
feel that all the affairs intrusted to the
embassy have been completed and that
there remains no unfinished business." .
After referring in eulogistic terms to
the Minister of Foreign Affairs, General
Porter said:
distinguished character of the guest*
present It has not been exceeded by any
thing of the kind held in recent years in
Paris. Practically the entire diplomatic
corps was represented. The American
guests, who numbered several hundred,
Included Henry Watterson, J. Pierpont
Morgan and President Dallieba of the
American Chamber of Commerce, the lat
ter acting as presiding officer.
A letter from Secretary Hay, In which
he paid a tribute to General Porter's
brilliant career, was read.
The speech of General Porter brought
out a tremendous ovation, the entire as
semblage rising and cheering. General
Porter, speaking in English, said in part:
"Eight years ago I was sent abroad. 1
do not know exactly why, unless it was
in consequence of the proverbial ambi
tion of our Government to increase its
exports. Thinking that I could not make
my soioum here immortal by making it
eternal, I gave notice last year that this
year I should go home to obtain for the
first time in my life a period of repose
after twenty-five years of public service,
and, surrounded by my children and the
friends of my youth, try to grow old
gracefully. I can at this moment say In
the words of another: 'I have thrown off
the robes of office and have now no rank
but that of fellowship, no title but that
of comrade.*
PARIS. May 17.â General Porter, the re
tiring American Embassador, was given a
notable farewell banquet to-night- For
eumptuousness of appointments and the
Choice of the next meeting place will be
made to-morrow. San Francisco and New
York are the rival candidates. " V^j,^ '
The association to-day passed a resolu
tion upholding the stand taken by Presi
dent Parry against the exercise by the
National Government tof rate-making
power over the railroads. .â¢ . . , : .â¢ '
James E. Emory of San Francisco de
livered a strong address upon "The Nec
essity of Organization of Employers to

Resolutions were adopted for the en
forcement of the "open shop" as embody
ing the true spirit of American liberty;
deprecating "the crimes and outrages on
personal liberty daily occurring" during
the Chicago teamsters' strike; commend
ing the utterances of President Roosevelt
when he declared that the State is back
of the city and the nation is back of the
State, and commending the position taken
by' Chicago citizens regarding the strike;
calling on the Department of Commerce
and Labor to make an investigation of
the laws of other countries which have
preferential duties and. demanding that
Congress and the President act quickly
to protect our markets from the rising
tide of discrimination; commending the
work of the Merchant Marine Commission
and approving the passage of a bill for
the upbuilding of American - shipping in
foreign trade. '.\u25a0â¢>] - .i ;- \u25a0."-."
ATLANTA, Ga., May 17.â The important
features of the second day's session of
the National Association of Manufac
turers were the addresses of President
Samuel Spencer of the Southern Railway;
the address of Eugene N. Foss of Mass
achusetts on reciprocity; the report of thÂ©
committee on resolutions, which caused a
lively debate, and the rejection of one
part of the report which called upon the
Isthmian Canal Commission to use Ameri
can-made goods in connection with the
canal construction.
. SANTA CRUZ, May .17.â There were
more sensational \u25a0developments in - the
family'^troubles of ; Millionaire Noel , and
his wife to-day. . Noel's attorney went to
the house on Noel Heights this morning
and secured , a surrey which Noel: claims
as his own. ; He also brought' suit in the
Superior Court for the possession of some
books, guns,; a -typewriter and other per
sonal property, which Mrs. Noe^is said to
hold. Mrs. - Noel was served Wiih papers
In the case to-night by Sheriff Traf ton,
who /secured two empty trunks. ; Noel's
clothing and some books. . â¢-â¢,'\u25a0:
On advice of District Attorney: Knlkht.
who'is her attorney, Mrs.,- NoelSU.wo'
weeks ago, filed a homestead bn\> Noel
Heights, which, with <\u25a0 the:: deed -â¢from
Theophilus Noel to his son, ties up the
property until; the parties come to a set
tlement. It seems to be a 1a 1 war between
the couple which cannot be : patched :up.
The community property consists of real
estate in Toronto. Canada, and a, large
interest in a medicine business running
into the millions. â¢
; SACRAMENTO, May 17.â Frank French,

and Al: Barnard.'-: While' Clerk - 1 Martin
According to the detectives of the
Pinkerton agency, .two cities are prom
ised the questionable honor of possess
ing a share of the plunder of defaulting
Tax Collector /; Edward J. â¢ Smith
"planted" within their limits. They j are
Denver and Los Angeles. The former,
the detectives assert, has the greater
part of the loot. It'is alleged to have
been taken to Denver by Leona Brooks
on a flying trip made by her before she
left with Smith on his; absconding,
flight. Nearly all of the remainder was
hidden , in' Los Angeles on April, 21,
where Smitl} stopped for five hours dur
ing, his flight from San Francisco... *
After careful inquiry and a searching j
investigation by . the -Pinkerton detec
tives in New York -the ; Pinkerton
agency has practically proved 'that de
faulting Tax Collector I-M ward J. Smith '\u25a0
did . not_pUinge..heayily_in the Wall
street stock market. Smith," from trie
moment of his capture; has repeatedly
asserted that a greater, part of the sura
taken by~ him ...was. lost jn .Wall street.
The yiquiries of the detectives have
persistently 'turned *to Lcona' Brooks,
the companion; of Smith. .The woman
made a 'particular, point of visiting
Denver and the detectives and local au
thorities afe'eonvinced that the .greater
portion'of the embezzled money is' hid
den there' So sure arc they ofthis fact
that it 'is' asserted, they are~nearly ready
to put their hands on a. large share of
the treasure. .'\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0 \u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0^-: :. â¢ . .
The local branch. of the agency has
had its men," at thedirection of the Na
tional Surety Company", visiting- every
broker representing a new York firm in
this city in the endeavor to -ascertain
whether â¢ Smith had- used their offices
for the. purpose of plunging in stocks.
The inquiry was. made so exhaustive as
to include .even the bucket ~ shops that
Smith might .have : used to cautiously
play the; market -with a few- hundred
dollars at_ a , time. All inquiry has
shown that Smith . has not done any
stock plunging in San ; Francisco and
the local .officers^ are convinced that
Lcona Brooks disposed, of a. portion of
the money on her visit to Denver. .
WOMAN VISITS â¢ â¢ DE.VVEIC
Leona 'Brooks- before "accompanying
Smith showed great anxiety to go to
Denver. There she; tarried for a day
before leavinsr-for New York. ;_ It is al
leged that, at that time-she disposed. of
some of the money." j It is asserted .that
had not Smith' presented Leona' Brooks
\u25a0with a ticket to Â»the coast' she would
have returned "by way l of Denver and
possibly-disclosed the hiding place.'. -
The detectives have been Investigat
ing the - : statement that". Smith save
money ami jewelry to .the amount of
Jls,ooo'to Miss' Lillian Leslie and Leona
Brooks. These -.statements-'. the police
and detectives have proved . to be . false.
The finger of suspicion' still points more
persistently at "Smith "as "having still at
his command...the sums of , which he
.mulcted the city's' taxpayers. . ,
â¢ From the' extreme reticence of. thÂ«
Pinkerton 'officials in" Los Angeles, it is
believed that .-important discoveries in
connection- with a portion, of > the
ing money -have, been, made and that
within a. very short time its actual loca
tion may: be. revealed. It is the opinion
of pariies. who. have reliable informa

der Is in a pafe deposit 'vault in thecity.

Sailors From Seattle.
TACOMA. Wash.. May 17.-A desperate
battle occurred last night on the decks
of tfce steamer Centennial in which sev
eral men were slightly injured and three
are thought <o have been drowned. The
Centennial, from San Francisco via Seat
tie, brought from the latter port a gang
or eighteen men to work the ship's cargo
here. Owing to existing trouble between
the Sailors' Union and the Longshore
men's Union, Captain Pierce had been
threatened with a boycott by the sailors
if he employed Tacoma longshoremen and
hence had hired a srew at Seattle.
When the steamer arrived in port about
230 longshoremen boarded her armed with
clubs, billies, pistols and other weapons.
The Seattle men were beaten wherever
found and some thirty shots were fired
before order was restored.
Of the sailors from Seattle who were at
tacked all have been accounted for but
three. These undoubtedly were forced
overboard and were drowned.

"What is believed to be the old Anvil
channel has been located opposite Dis

is very coarse and the ground is report
ed to be as rich as that found on the
famous Brown claim, Little Creek.
A strike has also been made on Elk
fraction, between Little and Moonlight
creeks, but no details are known other
than that it is one of the richest strikes
made in the history of the district.
SEATTLE. May 17. â Strikes of fabu
lously rich claims continue to be made
in tee Noise district and it is now an
undisputed fact that there are vast de
posit* of gold-bearing gravel lying be
neath the tundra in almost an unbroken
line from Penny River to Cape Nome. In
a cablegram received to-day by J. E.
Cfcilberg, the Information is conveyed
that the Portland Bench, on Little
Creek, is much richer than first report
ed, although the original strike was a
phenomenal one. Pans running from
540 to $100 had been taken out of this
rinfTp Chilberg's cablegram states that
ten pans amounting to 11400, and one
pan naning $1200, were taken out. This
is undoubtedly the richest pan of dirt
uncovered on the Seward Peninsula.
The property is owned by the Pioneer
Mining Company and is operated on a

OAKLAND. May 17.â ""That tired l eelins"
that follows in the wake of the first .warm

who consider their club duties first and per
sonal comtort next, are beginning to feel that
a day . of . rest is about due jinrt to <2rae th-ir

WUMam W&keSeld Whitton, of the col
lege of mining, had for his tbeme: "Pure
and Applied Science."
Miss Ethel B. Richardson of the college
of social sciences devoted her address to
a discussion of "The Unification of Ideals
Among College Women."
"The Duties of an Attorney at Law"
constituted Hugh Goodfellow's subject.
He is a graduate of Hastings College of
the Law.
The last of the seniors to speak was
Herbert H. Powell of the college of let
ters, whose subject was, "The Place of
Research Work in the University."
Captain Nance summoned the university
caflets who were entitled to military com
miasiocs upon the stage, and they formed
in line, backs to the audience, facing the
people on the stage. Governor Pardee ad
dressed them, saying:
"Yoonr gentlemen, it is to be hoped
that ytrar country will never again feel
the throes of warfare. It is to be hoped
CEkt not one of you, or any other citizen;
will be asked to lay down his lift to pre>
serre the Institutions of our country. It :
is Toecessary, however, to have men who j
arp ready for such a contingency. It win
be necessary to have either a large stand
ing armyâ which God forbidâ or to have
private citizens prepared to do their duty A
in military service, prepared as you are to
take part in commanding men in time of
war. The State, through me, its repre
sentative, now confers upon \u25a0 you these
coxnmisslox-s. They can be shown, if there <
should be need, to those who may require
sight of them to prove your right to as
sume command, as described in the com
missions. Gentlemen. I congratulate you
upon your preferment."
Captain Nance then called the roll, and
as 'the cadets responded the commissions
were handed them by Governor Pardee. .
?\u25a0 BERKELEY. May 17.â With impoeing
ceremonies, surrounded by dignitaries of
church and state, and faced by a vast
audience which completely filled the great
Greek Theater, members of the class of
05 of the University of California to-day
received their decrees, listened to care
fully written addresses of a select few
of the class and heard President Benja
min Ide Wheeler deliver a parting word
of counsel.
The commencement day exercises were
fiijtinguished by the presence on the
stage of Governor George C. Pardee. He
presented military commissions to those
of the university men who had "been
chosen for such honors and prefaced the
presentation wtth congratulations.
President Wheeler's address to the class
had lor its keynote the necessity of
patience on the part of those who now
be-nn their life-work. He decried the
â¢â¢â¢ret-rich-quick ' spirit and counseled his
"children" to build slcwly and advance
fcurtly, but urged them to swing quickly
out upon the sea that would bear them
from alma mater, that they might the
fcooner accomplish the journey for which
they had bctn preparing during their col
lege years.
At r o'clock the procession of candidates
for degrees formed under the direction of
C*ptain John T. Nance, military instruc
tor cf the university, in front of North
Hall.
Regents, ex-regents, guests of the uni
versity, the faculties and officers of
alumni bodies met in the Bacon art and
library building. The processions moved
at 2:Jh o'clock, the candidates leading un
-til the entrance to the Greek Theater
was reached, when the seniors formed In
double file, permitting the second proces
sion to pass through into the theater.
The theater had been appropriately dec
orated, the stage covered with blue and
gold festoons, while pennons floated from
the auditorium supports.
Governor Far dee asked the assemblage
to stand while the invocation was de
livered by Rev. Charles Newton Lathrop,
rector of the Church of the Advent In
San Francisco.
A choir under the direction of H. B.
Pasmore then eang "Gloria, California."
OX COLLEGE ACTIVITIES.
"â¢The Value of College Activities" was
discussed by W. H. Dehna, president* of
the Associated Students of the university,
whef was first of the seniors to deliver his
graduating address. He said In part:
"Every term we hear of men who have
been dropped from college because they
had engaged too recklessly in student
activities and meanwhile let their
scholarship suffer. Their mistake was in
the judgment of the proportion of things.
The fault was not In the activity, it was
in the man. If ono form, of student ac
tivity takes t-o m-.ich time, riroji that
and take up some other to which less
time need be devoted.
"Another criticism is that our college
life Is becoming too strsnuous. Tco much
la going on. The student is asked to give
up tec much time to games and plays and
dances. Toe list is increasing every term
and if the present rate keeps up. the
student will soon have no time for study.
This condition is not conducive to the full
<ievelopiaent of the college man. Too
much is often worse than not enough.
Ifce time has come when there should be
Gome regulation by the authorities, for
the university suffers as well as the In
dividual and tho university must protect
its reputation. Moderation in non
acaden-Jc activities la what I would
preach, above all things."

mitted to the directors of the board the
following programme of toasts and re
sponses:
Covers will be laid for 500 guests ] \u25a0 and
from the number, of favorable replies to
invitations already received there seems
to ;be no doubt that every place at the
board will be occupied. Owing to his ab
sence from the city it is feared that John
A. Britton, who has .been invited :to - re

unable 'to attend, but this has not as yet

GOOD TIME IS ASSURED
WELCOME BY JHE MAYOE
Graduates of State

"And now you set forth oorn r your? long
voyage. It is a long unity. Every part
belongs to the whole. Every mistake will
count in the final balance, and so will
every success; and both mistakes and
successes will roll up by compound inter
est. In terms of the total result you wjll
find that the patient doing of duty will
count more than the brilliant strokes . of
wit. It is patience, patience, and yet
again more patience that you will need;
for your life is one long account, and you
must give compound interest 'time- in
which to do its perfect work. Some "one
of the class will report alter the first year
a stately salary or a' brilliant opening in
business. Respice finem. I would rather
have the chance of some other one -who
is quietly doing day's work. After; fit
teen or twenty years that other will forge
to the front with his steadily accumulated
stock of sound reputation and public con
fldÂ»nee. I. tell you it is patience you will
need: patience. to 'do the little things thor
oughly and well ; patience to keep â¢ you
digging en your . own claim, to \ keep '\ you
at, work; on what comes next-j to your
hand, to keep you from 'skipping over, to
glittering deceits beyond; patirnce to hold
you to the gaining of results by processes
that naturally produce them, and the win
ning "of success by ; the I plain and simple
deserving of it- * The : man' who seeks a
position by the use '"of the- vulgar thing
vulgarly., denominated 'influence' and ; by
assembling indorsements * from men who
do not know him, the , man who seeks
business . and : conciliates .'standing* ;. by.
Joining societies he has no inner, use for,'
and wearing buttons his coat has no out
ward use for, the man -who \u25a0 covets an
office he has no preparation or fitness. for,
the man who hastens to get - rich-; by
methods that ;'do^ not 7 naturally w create
wealth,* each and all of them are drawing
checks with '% a false - signature ; they
sooner or later will bÂ« found out, and so
ciety will In- one' way] or ' another -return
their paper ; stamped ;v *no : funds.* The
trouble with' all such men is lack of moral
patience,!: and : this -great :, immorality of
impatience \u25a0 has its ultimate source* in ; the'
great irrellgion, " whose, devotees 'consume
each day. as if it were'the whole'of \u25a0 life;
mwi* whasA creed distrusts the' power; that
"The sooner a .man learns that only
what one gets for himself is really one's
own, the better. This consciousness of
absolute self -responsibility, * this ' sure
knowledge one's fate is at the cer
tain mercy of one's own acts and choices
brings with its first unfolding the appall
ing ionesomeness of the mighty deep
alone with one's fate and one's power to
control it; bu>. until one has thus been
once alone, he has never yet been once
a man. You have heard good advice al
ready to the full; you have had your
minds made up for you already too long.
You have now got to decide for your
selves, and having decided take for your
selves the consequences. You will still,
if you are wise, collect from those who
have had experience of life various guid
ances and advices, but they will be only
the data for the solution of a problem,
which is after all your problem. After
you have assembled the data, you will
have to decide yourself. You cannot, if
you are to be strong, flit from one ad
viser's solution to that of another, and
finally settle upon one of them. You
must create, as a new creation of your
own, your own solution. . The real uni
verse in which these souls of ours live is
not made of materials and mechanisms,
but is created clean and fresh in the de
liberate choices of mind and will. You
make your world as surely as the mold
er*s hands fashion clay. . You can rely on
no other person, however near and true,
to make it for you. Every strong man
who has achieved the . great i success of
life will surely tell you that at one and
another of the crises of his life he has
won his victory by acting independently
of, if not directly counter to- the advice
of every counsellor. It is . only through
the valley and the shadow of the al
mighty loneliness of' personal responsi
bility that any man has won the eternity
of character and strength.

PRESIDENT WHEELER TALKS.
President Wheeler called upon the
class of 1905 to stand and then ad
dressed its members is follows:
"When an army has captured the
enemy's camp, it is better not to fall .
upon the spoil, but to continue falling
upon the enemy. When a man has
achieved something:, it is better not to
stop for congratulations, but to move
on. The achievement is to be treated
as so much gathered headway, and the
moment of victory is the moment of
opportunity. . Stopping* to look at one's
self means loss to momentum, and In
the race of life it is at any given time
momentum more than distance that
yields the r^koning, for in the things
of the spirit Is it tension and quality,
not weight and quantity, that count.
The leading runner in, the dash dare
not turn to watch his antagonist with
out periling the victory. Eyes were
with purpose set in the front of heads,
and they that make for the mountains
must waste no time in gazing back
toward the cities of the plain or meas
uring the way they have passed. Salt
is good, but salt is the pillar and em
blem of the static, not the strenuous
life. Remember Lot's wife. They that
really run the race, they that really
live the life, set their eyes on the goal,
and press on toward the prize of their
high calling.
"Commencement day marks a begin
ning rather than an end. The ship
has made the run down the barhor and
is now going out over the bar. The
diplomas are not awards,- but they are
your clearance papers. The college
course fitted the ship, towed you down
the harbor and gave you your bear- :
ings. Now spread your own sails, get
out your sextants and peel your
weather eye. And one word further;
much as we shall miss you, we cannot
withhold i from you the urgent * advice
to quit sight of harbor and lighthouse
and land with all speed and make for
the open sea.

FOR UNIVERSITY FARM
Nothing had been stolen, which leads
to the belief that the loot the intruders
were after was the silverware, which
is kept in a secret place. . As there wera
no marks on the doors, which have
spring locks, it is supposed that the
burglars had been in the church at Sun
day night's service and had hidden
themselves till the congregation, had
dispersed and the sacred edifice had
been closed. They had left by the front
door. Detectives have been detailed on
the case by Captain Burnett.
When Sexton Branchflower opened
the church on Tuesday morning he was
soon made aware of the fact that bur
glars had been there. The floor was
strewn with partly burned matches the
burglars had used in finding their way
about the building. The vestment
locker and a desk had been opened with
a screwdriver and their contents scat
tered on the floor. The door of the
music closet in the basement had been
removed from its hinges and the music
thrown out. ' . .
St. Luke's Episcopal Church, Van
Ness avenue and Clay street, has been
desecrated by the presence of burglars,
who were evidently after two sets of
silverware used in the communion ser
vice. Their efforts were fortunately
useless.

REDWOOD CITY. May 17.â The final
meeting: of the Tertulio Whist Club was
voted the success of the season. It was
held at the borne of Dr. and Mrs. Maine,
â¢who welcomed the following guests:
Dr. and Mrs. Stineman. Captain and
Mrs. Nippert, Mr. and Mrs. E. B.
Thomas, Mr. and Mrs. Carl Muller, Miss
Beeger'and Carl Beeger.
WHIST CLUB A SUCCESS.
The trial of the case was begun before
Judge Ellsworth to-day, Niison claiming
that bis wife had no right to sell the
property and Sarment that he had paid
the money over to her in good faith.
The whereabouts of the woman is not
lenown.
OAKLAND, May 17.â Deceived by his
wife, who, he says, has sold his home
over his head. Carl A. Niison of 162S
L:ghth street began a fight to-day to try
to recover thÂ« home in which he has
lived fcr twenty years. He says that his
wife has left with a younger man and
taken 52300 she got for their home, with
out his knowledge.
Niison cays that he bought the place
in ISSI and put it in the name of his wife.
They have three children and lived there
until a short time ago, when his wile left
him. She had become infatuated with a
young man. he alleges. A week after her
disappearance, A. Sarment, a grocer liv
ing at Third and Campbell streets, served
notice on Niison that he had purchased
the place and gave Niison notice to move
out.
If the intruders fancied that. the church
officials keep large . sums . lying around
loose in the church buildings they suf
fered a. disappointment last night. . Al
though they searched each of the four
big ediilcc-s with care, opening, every
drawer and peering Into every nook, they
found no more than $3 40. About half of
this sum came from St. Mark's Church.
| Marshal Vollmer is sure that the work
was done by professional thieves. As ad
ditional proof that the burglars were pro
fessionals, the Marshal cites their ignor
ance of church folk's customs in the mat
ter of handling- moneys.
BERKELEY. May 17.â Thieves broke
Into four of the most prominent churches
of Berkeley last night, rifling the drawers
and overturning the furniture In the First
Congregational. St. Mark's Episcopal.
First Christian and Unitarian churches.'
Skeleton keys and "jimmies" were used,
according to Marshal Vollmer, who ex
amined the evidences left by the sacri
legious marauders.
The same gang is believed to have
broken into; the 'home' of Rev. E. L. Par
sons, rector of St. .Mark's, last night.
The thieves got only $5-40 from the four
churches. and the home of the Episcopal
minister. \u25a0

LIVING EXAMPLE.
MIRROR OF DAME FASHION
THE names of men- and women are the hardest words in the language
to remember, chiefly because they all come' by chance rather than
through anyVreal relation, be' ween the person owning them and their
spelling and sound. -. ...
As they are generally the last thing to be >ired in the memory,
so they are the readiest to drop out, having little or nothing to hold them
in. '- '. . '-,-'> # st; \ \' /." i ' ; ' : /. " ' \u25a0 '
Everybody knows an occasional family^ name that flt3. as where Mr.
Small chances to be of no great stature, or Mr. Black has dark hair and a
darker skin. There are others which go by contraries, as when ' MrMJttle
attains a stature of several inches over six feet, oc Mr. Reed â which is sim
ply the, older pronunciation of "red"â is -prematurely, gray. Such, names
find lodgment in,' the memory for/obvious reasons.
So, too, Christian names, especially when, they degenerate into nick
names,- fit into the scheme of things pretty well, because they'are individ
ually bestowed. "
It is a good deal of a guess with any parent just how a baby is going
to turn out when it is christened, but the name is at least intended for that
particular individual, and not, as in the case of a-family name, for a num
ber of the most diverse of t individualities. Nicknames come even closer to
fitting, since, triey are accorded their wearer after he has grown up wholly
or in. part. "/. *. â¢"*;-v^ ., '.".. â¢\u0084 ' . - i..r> ' \u25a0 \u25a0-â¢
A little care in fitting first names to the family name will make the
'whole of them more quickly memorable. Three monosyllabic names to
gether, like James Knox Polk, are difficult to hold in mind. *Names where
; the rhythm is. varied, like Oliver Wendell Holmes, and Elizabeth Stuart
Phelps. 'are better. "Such i names as Jonathan / Edwards, William McKln
ley, Benjamin; Harrison, Whitelaw Reid, where the first name practically
has three/syllables of which the. first is accented, are more readily kept in,
mind than others. \u0084 : - " â¢
Unusual names. " like Rudyard .Kipling and J^ider .Haggard, have little
or no advantage. In fact, three/similar names, like Edmund Clarence Sted
man, eeem -easier/ to recall than two.' On the "other." hand, such a combina-*
tion of two asÃret Harte or John Hay. stays longer than three. /-
The habit of remembering names, as i; of memorizing generally, can be"*
â¢readily cultivated, with 'a little pains taking. Public, men ;and -hotel clerks
do not enter' public life .or "the" hotel business because they have excellent
, memories/ in that .particular ; respect, but acdulre the faculty because it is
;so necessary to them. It is an accomplishment worth having.

REMEMBERING PROPER NAMES
, We chaperon our/girls' arid carefully
guard them' against unworthy boys, but
we leave; the iboy.' to- choose fori himself
his. associates' and -his achleyements,,
- Girls are naturally winsone, gentle,
companiohablel. They win their. way in
homes and j hearts.' But the boy, ; noisy,
awkward,- mischievous; is , invited ; into
few homes and feels none too" much at
home in his own. About the only door
that swings Iwith"1 with" sure j.welcomo to the
boy, about the only chair that is shoved
near the flre especially for the boy,
about the' only place where -he is sure
of cordial greeting isâ where he ought
not to go. . -, \u25a0 .
; It is one of the hardest things in the
world to get hold of a boyâ to get a
sure grip on him. 'He is. hungry for
companionship and hfe will have it. You
can't chain him away from it.: He
wants/the companionship' of boys, and
nothing will take its place. ' If the rime
of selfishness has so encased your heart
that the. joys and of your, boy
cannot enter into it, the boy is to\be
pitied, but so are; .'you. â Milwaukee

ANSWERS TO QUERIES.
* r "p*HE arrival of Mr. Gompers in Chicago, apparently for the pur-
I pose of helping Mr. Shea let go, was made the occasion for dis
* closing the cause of: the strike. It is worthy of study. A num
ber of the indoor employes of Montgomery Ward & Co. ordered
..their employer to cease dealing with certain firms. The employer
declined to take orders from that source. As Montgomery Ward &
Co. did not claim the right to dictate to employes where they should
deal for what they buy, it was not plain to the firm that law or
ethics subjected them to such dictation from their employes. But
the latter claimed the right and struck to enforce it. That was the
beginning of the trouble. Mr. Shea used the teamsters employed
by the firm to back up the strikers, and the affair spread until it
assumed the character of an insurrection which justified the Presi
dent in declaring that if the government of Chicago and the State
â¢of Illinois could not compel obedience to the law the United States
would.
There was no question of hours or wages involved at any point.
The sole issue was the right of an employe to dictate, to his em
ployer where he should trade and wifh whom he should do business.
To enforce that issue several murders have been committed and a
\u25a0 large number of men have been maimed for life. It should not be
necessary to say that an employe who slavishly submits to hi^
employer's dictation as to where he will spend his earnings or with
\Vhom he will trade is a serf, a poor citizen and a bad American.
Such submission to the arbitrary will of another .is a surrender of
natural, inherent rights, and it affects the whole community, for
,when one man surrenders his rights he weakens the rights of all.
These truths, being self-evident when viewed from the standpoint
of the wage earner, are no less seif-evident when considered from
the standpoint of the wage payer. It is safe to say that no labor
strike will ever be supported by public opinion when its object is
the coercion of the employer and abridgment of his,' freedom to do
business with whom he pleases*.
',1 Mr. Shea has shown plenty of*the spirit of the persecutor, but
fortunately has not the power to carry it out.- His order to hack
drivers to dump their passengers a block away/from their destina
tion, subjecting ladies to exposure to the storm and ;the pefilsVof
a mob, is evidence that he thought he could use the slavish obedience,
of his men to coerce. the second dry of the Union to submit to his
will. * It would not be an American community that: would surren
der to such dictation, and it is;wdlfor>he;s^ilÂ«rsAhemselves that

CAUSE OF CHICAGO STRIKE.
A few years ago the corn raisers of Nebraska, finding a big
crop on their hands, demanded a reduction in freight rates to Chi
cago. The railroads granted the reduction and the producers ex
pected to add it to their price. But immediately the price of corn
in Chicago fell the exact amount of the freight reduuetion, and the
producers were just where they were before.
We have many economic students among the producers of Cali
fornia and the railroads have experts. Can any of them account
for exclusion of the cost of production from the final price of any
article and the inclusion of everything else?, -I;-
Fruit shippers everywhere have a complaint against these pri
vate lines. While it is denied that they have an exclusive contract
covering the California business, it is admitted that they have been
giving rebates here to the injury of such producers as are denied
equality of treatment. Our California fruit growers are not the
only people in that business who suffer and complain of misfortunes.
The Madrid "Correspondencia de Espana" publishes the story of
the shipment of grapes from the Spanish province of Almeria in
1904. Our own growers will be interestel in the many familiar
features of the narrative. In 1904 Almeria shipped for export
1.900,000 barrels of those fine grapes, which appear in our Eastern
cities about holiday time. The fruit is packed in cork waste. The
stems are dry, but the berries are plump and sound. It was sup
posed that such a large export meant prosperity for Almeria, but
the Correspondencia declares that it was a misfortune, and is re
sulting in the ruin of Almeria. Taking a shipment of twenty arro
bas, or ten barrels, as the unit, the grower paid for the barrels, cork
waste and packing, 35 pesetas, or $4 90; hauling to railroad and
freight to Almeria, the seaport, and loading on the ship, bring the
cost up to $5 74. The fruit is shipped to London and sold in Pud
ding Lane, and the average price of the crop of 1904 was 5 shillings
a barrel, or $1 22. But as one barrel must be opened for sampling
it brings only 61 cents, which makes the whole shipment bring
I! 55- Out of this must be taken the $5 74 accrued before the
fruit left Almeria, and from the balance is taken embarkation dues,
insurance, dock charges, unloading, wharfage, warehousing, seller's
commission, broker's fee, all amounting to $5 82. Add this to the
$5 74 and we have the total cost of the shipment to the producer
?n 56 for property that brings him only $11 55.
We think many a California producer will recognize brethren
in distress in these Almeria vineyardists. The Correspondencia
says that Almeria's grapes shipped to the 'United States in 1904 paid
a profit, and the results were favorable, but gives as a reason for
this "the fact that the California crops were a. failure " on account
of the cold season. But we cannot always count upon the North
American markets, and the very fact that the freight .was saved by
such a contingency gives an idea of the great instability, of : the
principal Almerian industry."
If it will comfort the Almerians who toil in the vineyards on
the slopes of the Spanish Sierra Nevada, let them be assured that
the California crop did not fail last year, but was above the average.
This story of the Almerians is interesting. â¢ It seems that the
price in the final market was apparently made by the cost of pack
ing, shipping, brokering and everything except the cost of produc
tion. The producer came out in debt to those who handled his
property after it left his hands. Everybody who touched it made
a profit out of it except the producer. All costs, except that of pro
duction, followed it and were paid by the consumer! Can any one
tell why this is so, as an economic proposition? Some may say
that Almeria grapes are a luxury. But luxuries get their character
as such by their rarity and high price. The necessaries of life
share misfortune with the Almeria grapes. The cost of. their pro
duction does not follow them to the consumer, but freight and other
intermediate charges do.
IX reviewing the investigation of the Armour private car line by
the Interstate Commerce Commission, we said that the issue
would be made that such lines are not under the interstate com
merce law. But we insisted that thej' were under the law of com
mon carriers and must give equal service at equal price to all.
Another investigation is being made by a committee of the.
United States Senate, in which Mr. Robins, president of the Armour
car lines, is a witness. He has made the issue that we foresaw, and
denies that his private line is subject to the interstate commerce
law or to the law of common carriers. Yet he admits that his line
has exclusive contracts with various railroads, and thereunder the
power to charge the shipper any tariff it pleases. He admitted, fur
ther, that the roads that enter into. this exclusive contract are
thereby forbidden to carry in their own cars any of the merchandise
that the Armour cars carry.
It will be seen at once that the plea of non-liability under the
interstate commerce law is not good. If a private line can make
an exclusive contract with a. railroad to carry one or ten classes of
freight, it can make such contract to carry the whole classification
of freight. Then if, as Mr. Robins claims, the private line is not
amenable to any law, it can charge what it pleases, give rebates and
pool with other private lines, and with impunity do any and every
act that is penalized by the interstate commerce law and the law
of common carriers. Such a claim is preposterous, and we are con
vinced that the courts will not sustain it.

IT was such an Inspiration
As but rarely comes to man;
For. the Muse had whispered to me.
And to frame it I began. .
Aiid there was no studied meter;
It was rhythm so divine \u25a0
That the simple words made music
As they swung themselves In line.
So I welded fast together,
As they came, each golden link.
They were Btraight from Natures foun

And my heart's blood was the ink.
Then I thought this true-born offspring
By the favored Bhould be seen. \u25a0
So I sent it, as my duty,
" To a high-class magazine.
For a month I watched and waitedâ
-One long month of hope deferred-
Then a line: "With' thanks rejected,
Came the only printed word.
So I sat In meditation
At this most perplexing news,
And I got my pen and paper,
But I didn't have my Muse.
Then V chopped and sawed and ham
mered.
As I might a piece of wood:
There was nothing. in the matter.
But the workmanship was good-
Save the theme, the rhyme and .meter,
For such little things, I thought.
Were a hindrance to acceptance,
And 1 made this to.be bought. â
And, to make an obscure meaning. ','...
. (None, in fact), much pains I spent;
So that, when my work was finished,
I did not know what it meant!

And It brought "a check toTttn.

J. J. Clausey, chief gunner's mate
aboard the gunboat Bennington, has
been posted as a deserter. He had
been away from the vessel for ten days
without leave. Clausey is supposed to
have decamped because of certain Illegal
financial transactions charged against
him.
The missing man was caterer for the
chief petty officers* mess aboard the Ben
nington. In this capacity be acted as pur
chasing 3gent for the mess and was also
delegated by the sailors to transact busi
ness for them. Since his departure It is
said that unpaid bills aggregating nearly
$2000 have been presented at the ship. "It
ls^also said that the amount will not ex
ceed $700.' Clausey was given money to
pay - all bills contracted by him for Â£ne

Court, with bail fixed at $5000, by Judge
Mogan.
George M- Harrington, who was ar
rested while running amuck and brand
ishing a raxor In a Salvationist refuge on
Xatcma street, attributed his conduct to
the Â«atanlc Influence of rum, of which
beverage he had Indiscreetly drunk two
glasses for medicinal purpose only. "Ex
hibiting a deadly' weapon. In a rufle and
threatening manner" was the : charge
booked against him by Patrolman CoglU,
and Judge Mogan will dispose of it to-fiay.
Mrs. Jennie Rosky told Judge Fritz that
divorce was likely to be resultant of her
arrest If the bay mariner whose name she
bore should cither read or hear of it. He
was skipper of a hay-laden scow schoon
er now en route from Sonoma Landing to
Ban Francisco, and If she were not at the
wharf to greet his return he would sure
ly Institute incjuiry as to her whereabouts.
Hss discovery that she was incarcerated
for drcnktnsess would certainly be fol
lowed by tbe filing of a suit for sever
ance of bis marital tie. If he had not re
fused to allow her to accompany him on
bis voyage she would never have thought
of such a thing as drinking more than
her accustomed daily gallon of beer, but
in her loneliness she sought solace by
consuming double that quantity of the
beverage. Asked by the court if her hus-
Tiand had excusable' reason for excluding
her from his vessel, she answered in the
negative. All she had ever done to pro
voke such treatment, she explained, was
to Quarrel with the officers and crew,
consisting of Hans Peterson, who was
also the cook. Hans never knew how to
brew coffee as it Ehould be brewed, and
as his captain's wife ehe had considered
herself entitled to tell him so to his face.
Patrolman J. J. Cameron testified that
when he gathered in Mrs. Rosky from a
corner of Third and Mission streets she
was uttering language most frightful to
hear. It frightened horses and made win
dewe rattle. In response to his Honor's
Inquiry if she had visited profanity upon
Hans, fche said she might, in beat of
anger, have dropped a swear word or
two. " Then the Judge opined â¢ that an
explosion of oaths such as tbe prosecut
ing policeman had quoted as emanating
from her would be dangerous to a cargo
so inflammable as that carried by her
husband's craft, and that thÂ© question
of obtaining fire insurance might have
cjit some figure in hla determination to
leave her ashore. However, the twenty
four hours which she had already spent
in prison sufflced to satisfy justice, and

The letter was not signed, but "Jack"
was on hand. It is stated that he had
been led into believing that he was the
only one the fair Etta had ever loved,
and for many months most "of his earn

When he found out that he was not the

awful ruction. He went into her rooms
and tore up the dresses he had helped
to buy and cut up her hats and her rib

OAKLAND, May 17.â T0 get even with
a woman he says played him false, John
Scott gave a love letter written to him
by Mrs. Etta Larsen, a pretty and petite
blonde, whose husband is away at pres-^
ent, into the hands of her enemies, and
the letfex was read In court to-day, to her
confusion. She was the proprietor of the
Davis HouÃe, at 419 Sixth 'street, 1 and has
been turned out of the place through
foreclosure proceedings. In" combating
this she said that the money paid for the
house was her husband's separate prop
erty, and then the following letter was
sprung by the other side:
"Friday, Oct. 3.â My Own Jack: The
girls are not going to Oakland to-mor
row night, so you come over here and
meet me at Third street at Lotta's foun
tain. I must gt-e youâ the most Important
thing to us and our welfare.
The resolution will make a special
appeal to the Police Department to con
stitute each policeman a truant officer,
whose aim it will be to compel the at
tendance of all children of school age,
â¢This resolution is Important," said
Roncovieri, "and I trust that it will re
ceive attention- Our average daily at
tendance is now about 40,000 in a total
of 208,000 pupils for "the entire State.
There is no doubt" that the other flfty
six counties will make extraordinary
efforts to increase the * attendance In
schools, as the school revenue will be
computed on the attendance. Now It
behooves San Francisco to make ex
traordinary efforts to Increase the num
ber of pupils from 40,000. If we do not
and other counties make an \ increase
it will reduce our pro rata of. the State
funds. We ought to have an average
attendance of 50,000 or 60,000 and we
can have it if we work together. Bach
city department Is interested in *the
matter, as the more money we receive
from the ; State the less -will the, city
have to- provide , for - schools - and thÂ«
money so. saved can be utilized to pave
streets or for other public Improve
ments. The Supervisors, however, "must
certainly give us the funds to establish
the extra clases which will be required
to accommodate any largely increased
i attendance of pupils."-
The resolution is in the nature of an
appeal to all the municipal depart
ments, including that of the police, and
to citizens generally, .to co-operate , in
the enforcement of the law that > re
quires all children under 14 years of
age to go to school and prohibits them
from working under ths child labor
law, : which is - also a new measure
passed by the last Legislature.
It is said that the law will compel
the dismissal of several thousand chil
dren under 14" years, of age who have
been; employed in the " department and
other stores. It is with the purpose of
compelling: thesa children to go to
school that the Board of Education in
vites the assistance of the public at
large to. Increase the daily attendance
of pupils. Children between 14 and 16
years of ag-e will only be permitted to
work by. special permission from the
Juvenile Court on condition that their
parents are invalids and. require their
support. Some of these children also
\u25a0will therefore be compelled to go to
school. , . ;
. School Director Roncovieri, president
of the Board of Education, . was busy
yesterday preparing: a resolution which
will be adopted at to-day's meeting of
the board and having for its object
the increase of the average dally at
tendance 01 pupils in the public schools.
The fact that the State apportion
ment of the common school funds it
based under a recent act of the Legis
lature on the actual attendance, instead
of the school census, as formerly, -will
cause a .loss of some $250,000 in the
school revenue of San Francisco. It is
therefore, with "the Idea of increasing
the attendance of pupils in order to
make up some of'tbo loss in revenue
that, the resolution prepared by Ron
covieri will be adopted.

SEATTLE, Wash, May 17.â Rcscoe Mil
ler still had his hoodoo with him to-day
when he pitched his first game for Seattle.
He* twirled fine ball, but the men be
hind him- could not hit when hits; were
needed. Oscar Graham* also pitched swell
ball,' and Oakland got a big 'start, in the
first inning when Miller issued his only
pass and r Kruger Strieb and Devereaux
hit safely. After, that , Miller, settled nicely,
and was master of the situation..; Graham
staxted-out steady and he kept up his
gait to the end. The men behind him did
not have many chances, but : they .^ took
what was offered. The day was cold- and
raw; and ,the. players shivered' as. well as
the spectators. Score:- ; ,'-:>V -.'i^

Tb<Â» annual butcher day was
celebrated in royal style yesterday at
Emeryville race track and at Shell Mound
Park. At the former place seventeen
races, ranging from, those for stately
thoroughbreds down to the lowly mule
and the steer, Vwere witnessed by a gayly
dressed holiday throng winch taxed the
capacity of the huge stand and over
flowed on to the clubhouse lawn and the
infield. To give full measure of excite
ment^ a bronco buster went through feats
of horsemanship and rough riding.
The day passed without any one being
injured, although two horses tried to
break into the accident list. F* f Guiliani's
Chief bolted after a race, but was stop
ped by Dr. Dalziel, who caught and held
him when his driver was nearly ex
hausted. R. Cansanis' Kreuger bolted
through a sate leading from the track
and then overturned his sulky. Both
horse and <lriver escaped with minor
bruises.
The bookmakers did aland office busi
ness, even if tiiey did keep- a strangle
hold on the prices. They paid $1900 for
the privilege' for to-day and ran things
In free and easy style.-- In one race
there were six horses in the bands of
the starter while the names of only
three ornamented the slates of the syn
dicate.
The public usually finds much to crit
icize, but there â¢was not the usual
chance yesterday. In one of the mile
races Toledo was a hot public choice.
A good start was expected, but Jockey
lloody pulled him up. There were cries
for the judges to call all bets off, but
the race was allowed to stand. In an
other mile race Celeres, also ridden by
Moody, finished third. The mile was
covered in' l:44%. Celeres was recently
purchased lor $5000 by Ed Gaylord, the
Denver turfman, and is a candfdate for
the Colorado Derby.
The steer race and the race for mules
furnished the comedy part of the pro
gramme. The steers were undersized,
but they had broncos backed off the
board for bucking:.' Each was equipped
with a halter and a. stout surcingle, to
which the riders clung with despera
tion. The steers would trot a short dis
tance and would then unseat th-eir
riders. One went over the fence, scat
tering the crowd. F. Mora's Spot finally
won.

Much credit is due the various commit

was handled. Every convenience was of
fered the crowd from the time it left
this city until it returned home in the
Over at Shell Mound Park thousands of
pleasure-seekers - enjoyed themselves to
their hearts' content. A more orderly or
good natured crowd could not be select
ed. The favorable weather conditions and
the execllent management made, the af
fair a pronounced success.
The athletic programme was an elabo
rate one, and afforded amusement for
both young and old. Dancing was per
haps the most popular pastime. - From
early morn until after sundown the pa
vilion was filled with' a merry gathering.
The races and games also attracted
many competitors. Several hundred dol
lars' worth of cash prizes were distrib
uted to the winners in the various events.
Cash prizes were also given to amateur
performers, which included singers of
coon songs, buck and ! wing dancers and
cakewalkers. The judges had , a 'difficult
time in selecting winners, as many of
them showed unusual ability. -

Richard Havey sent all the fields away
well, being ably assisted by William
Fieldwicit- The last race was not' run
until after 7 o'clock.-
Among the entries for the mile race
was Master L. Miller's Young America,
which was hardly as large as â¢ a good
sized dog. He was finally boaten out for
fourth place by Maud, a bis but demure
mule, which refused to set a fast pace.
The bronco buster took up a. collection,
which he tad taken care to announce
frequently, after his performance. %He
was not allowed to invade the grand
stand, and his returns were only $4 20.
The more he looked this over the more
angry he became. He finally harangued
the crowd and wound up by tossing the
handful of silver into the air. The small
boys eyed the coin on the track, but the
special police would not let them take it.
Finally some one to!d them to help them
selves. For a few moments it seemed
there would be a part of Bill Fieldwick's
favorite track missing. When the dust
finally cleared away the boys came out
of the scrimmage with pieces of the coin
to show for their efforts.

NEW YORK, ; May 17.â Bewildering to a

Park to-day was the decision of the stew
ards that Hy las should not be disqualified
after winning: the steeplechase. He had
p/amly swerved^ to the left before reach
ing the last jump and interfered so no
ticeably with Sandhurst that all over the
grounds there were instantaneous offers
of 2 to 1 that Sandhurst would be award
ed the race. Despite all feeling engen
dered by the ruling, however, tribute was
paid the game, and j persevering race run
by | Hylas .up to the - time he swerved.

When Uncle grabs a tosser from some
other team he is sure to be a winder.
That sort of dope has always gone here,
and it was made a bit stronger yesterday
when Dick Williams put .the'. Giants' out
of commission. Dick had been a Seal but
a few hours, yet the change did him good.
Scoreâ San Francisco 2, Portland 1.
\u25a0 Williams, was.; about the only man. on
the team \u25a0 who played baseball at- that,
with the possible -exception of . Spencer.'
The rest of the gang were awful. They
did not cpmmit errors or, any thing like
that. They simply refrained from mak
ing runs when chances looked good, and
unless Williams was twirling big league
ball Uncle would have run second.
Jones was hammered and banged
around in every winning, yet the eleven
hits, that came mostly in -bunches, pro
duced but three runs. During the first
two innings a couple of men were caught
off the bags â Ir win at second and Spencer
at third. After that hits came with reg
ularity, but' the base runners did not seem
to be there. , \u25a0 \ . ;
If Jones had any, stamina he might
have carried off the game. He fell down
in the fifth, as he always does. After
Nealon had torn loose a double, Wilson
fanned. . I Jones, without ' any provocation,
passed the next two men and then in
duced Waldron to pop up a fly. Itevcn
looked good for .him then, but Spencer
went after a wide one and it dropped
back, of Atz. letting Nealon and Goch-r
nauer come through. \u0084

The young: women of the Lowell
High School , basket ball team went
down to defeat before the ; experts of
the Berkeley High School yesterday at
the g-ymnasium of the "Young- Men's He
brew Association by the score of 3 to 1.
The game was extremely' close; from
beginning until the final blast of the
referee's whistle.
Throughout the game it would have
taken but a single throw from the field
on the part of Lowell to have evened
the score To get \ around; their oppo
nents for a moment was next'toim^
possible for the fair wearers of the
red and .white, and the' Berkeley girls
found the same- difficulty. All â¢ the
points scored by either side were made
on free throws resulting' fronvfoulsj by
their, opponents. This defeat' is fatal
to the aspirations of Lowell for the
championship, "but tbe~ local?girlsitake
the small end of the score \wlth: the
â¢ouowledg'e of having played their best.'

KANSAS CITY SELECTIOXS.
Walter Scribner was arrested for racing his
new Cameron gasoline automobile down Mar
ket stref t at a furious rate of speed yesterday,
and landed up at toe Harbor Police Station.
Scribner was locked behind the bars, and the
machine stood in the middle of' the station.
It was an unusual thing- to have -an auto
under arrest in that part \u25a0 of town, and \u25a0 at
tracted great attention. Scribner said he was
trying to make quick â¢ time to the- ferry, so
that his two friends with him would not miss
their boat to Oakland, and that perhaps he
did go a little faster than the regulation eight,
mllee per hour as prescribed by city ordinance.
His friends caught the boat and he got locked
up. Later be was bailed out.

CHICAGO, May 17.â Heavy profit taking re
sulting from improved : weather \u25a0 conditions In
the Northwest caused a setback in wheat. prices
here to-day. At the close the price of wheat
for July delivery was oft 1"4@1%c. July corn
Is up %c. oats and provisions are practically
unchanged: â¢:.\u25a0.':'.:'\u25a0 : \u25a0 \u25a0â¢â¢ .â¢
Weakness waft manifested in the wheat mar
kef throughout the . entire ; session. At" * the
opening "July was down , %c , to :%c at 87 % c to
87% c .". Two main factors entered Into the sit
uation to contribute . to the initials decline. One
of these Influences was ; the weakness of the
wheat market at Liverpool. More significance,
however, was generally i attached .to the pros/
pects . cf clear weather ,.- In the . spring i whe/t
countrj", official reports Indicating, clear i^W
and higher temperatures throughout the \u25a0Nqfcim
west." . Soon r after \u25a0 the i opening \u25a0 covering^by
shorts forced :. up ; tbe ,; price â¢ of. July Jto s 87*^"@
87"& c but a reaction quickly followed.
the early: part' of ; the session . the . trading was
active, several large i, holders *? being -' liberal
sellers. .- Sharp .declines ;; at i Minneapolis - and
Duluth encouraged? the bears here/ * Later -th<
selling pressure .was checked- materially by lan
unfounded report? of 'a -Chicago crop. .expert."
Outside this : report there ; was little :\u25a0 news â¢of
a bullish nature. S During the last half . hour of
trading shorts '\u25a0 were fair ~ purchasers,^ but ; this
demand - caused ' only a slight rally. The mar
ket . was weak < at ' the close - with . final quota
tions : on \u25a0 July |at 86%@SÂ«%c. .
The May option ;was again the star attrac
tion In the corn s market. The : market. opened
exceedingly strong ; and â¢ closed -â¢ strong. - . May

E. F. Estton & Co.. 490 California street.
Fan Francisco, members of the New. York
Etock Exchange, furnish the following ofSclal
quotations of that Exchange:
""The feeling is abroad." Bays the Iron Age,
'"that a fresh baying movement cannot well
be expected until well znzo June, and that
the crop prospects will have a decided Influ
ence apon the movement." This broke the
market and wiped out the Cay's gajss for the
most part. There were some ralliÂ«k on short
coverings, but the closing was unsettled.
Bond.' were steady. Total tales, par value,
f1.9f5.000.
United States bonds were all unchanged on
call.
TCEW TORK. May 17.â There were a few
xnor* scarce dealt tn on tie Stock Exchange
to-day tlian yesterday, bat the listless char
ncter of taÂ« tracing was not altered. The
market showed the urn* deposition to yield
the day's extreme changes, the only difference
belEff thatT yesterday those changes were de
c Uses znada In the first hour and followed by
a slow mc-reraeat of retrleral. -while to-day
the on!; contlderable galss were established
tfarlair the first ho-ir and were elowly yielded
afterward. The exceptica waÂ» St. Paul, which
rr-arie Its highest prices later In the day. re
sponding to several distinct buying movements
which lifted the price a stage higher each time.
The effect of this apeciat movement on the
general list steadily demolished throughout the
day and practically lost :tÂ» Influence in the
later trading. Union PadSc showed a epeclal
rymp&thy at first and was almost as active as
Ft. Paul Itself, but itÂ» price arooped and Its
activity demolished before the operations in
Â£t. Paul closed. Thota operations were at
rributed very largely to professional account
fend tbe B&sjr ruracre aOoat to account for
them Associated Â£t. Paul and Northern Pacific
In one way or another. The assertions re
garding these two companies pointed to ab-
Borpticn of one by the other, thej absorbing
corr.pany varying in the rumors. 4 Meantime
Northern Pacific Itself ana Great Northern
showed evidence of some pressure, and Miis
largely deprived the St. Paul movement of Its
influfnee. ThÂ« market has some help from a
renewal of reports in circtuation iln European
: \u25a0'.:\u25a0â¢.. 1 1^1 centers of a revival or efforts among
ti-.e powers Indirectly Interested to bring about
3^*fcoe in the Far East. The London stock
rr.arket showed sensible relief from | .c pres
fure of be;ated liquidations, which has caused
dcprÂ«ssloa there Xor -several days past. The
veakenljsg of the price of wheat oa account
of the weather reports 6howicg clearing condi
tions and roore favorable prospects In the win
ter whÂ«*tt>eir "helped the market. Reports of
a project- on tbe part of Kansas City Southern
for securing an independent outlet to Kew
1 T'.'-ir.s gave sctne strength to its stocks. The
Trost effective check to the Influence of the St.
Paul n>ovÂ«ment was the heaviness of the United
Spates -. Eteel stocks, which were depressed
throughout on tne fear that the Iron Age'e
weekly review of trade conditions would make
An unfavorable showing. The appearance in
"U*Â£li street of tlie advance sheets of that re
view were fcllexred by an active Belling move
ment, which Treakesed all of the mtal stocks
and especially the United States Steel Etocks.
Anxiety was caused by the statement that the
buying movement of pig Iron had been almost
arreeted. while indications were that the Job
bing trade had overbought early In tbe year
in the lighter lines of finished Iron and steel,
and that the offering of concessions was of
j>rcib!<;u!a.t!cal success in moving goods.

Howes, with 2240 tons. There are two cargoes

ducers. Shipments from British Columbia are
of sufficient volume to make good the deficit
created' by ''the email arrivals from Australia.
There is a growing. disposition to charter grain
carriers at improved prices for future arrivals;
this should lead "to a reduction on Coal rates

About 2000 men. women and children,
most of whom were on their way to the
St. Dominic's picnic at Camp Taylor,
added to the momentum of the big
craft and made her blow against the
piling a.s resistless as an avalanche.
M nn y of the passengers, as usual in
such cases, crowded forward when the
landing was approached, all eager to be
the first to alight and hasten to the
train for seats. The pressing forward,
of hundreds co crowded the bow of the
vessel thatvÂ«scape from the impact was
impossible.
The coolness of a score or two in
front of the crowd, who refused to
rush for the shore, saved a stampede
that must otherwise have resulted in
the killing of many people. The frantic
efforts of a few young men to reach
shore added to the fear of the women.
A number were more or less hurt and
many women fainted. The following

less of the signals of the pilot to re

not in order and the engines would
not respond.
There was a terrific crash, which
â¢wrecked the forward part of the boat,
tore and injured the Blip and hurt some
of the passengers. A bad panic, was
averted by the presence of mind of
many passengers and of the officers and
crew. Captain Charles Bagge and En
