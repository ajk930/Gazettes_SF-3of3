WASHINGTON, March 12.â Contracts
are about to be let for the office palace
erf the House of Representatives. â  The
obstruction of a solid block of fir old
Washington residences to make room
for an office palace for the Senate has
been begun.
The Fifty-eighth Congress smothered
an omnibus public building bill
amounting to $3,500,000, and excised it
f-elf to clair.orir.g and disappointed con
stituents by saying President Roose
velt prevented the appropriation be
cause he insisted upon a -new navy.
The real reason was that the Represen
tatives and Senators had entered upon
o tcheme to provide themselves with
private quarters rivaling in magnifi
cence the Library of Congress and at
<>a c cost which probably will exceed $10,
000.000.

"What is a deficit between friends?"
has become The watchword of Con
gress. The entering wedge was driven
years ago, when a building was-ac
quirer! for offices for the Senate and
House. When the Representatives
went to the building to get their share
of th^ offices they found the Senators in
possession of every one. The House
chafed under this until it was decid-d
two years ago that the House should
erect a building of its own. Th Sen
ate- approved of this measure and
promptly came forward with a sugges
tion that the Senate also build a pal
ace, because several Senators now have
only two or three small rooms in their
private suites and pome have fto be
content with one room.

ROCHESTER. N. V.. March 12.
' Boxing is foot exercise for ministers
to get their wind up on," said Rev. S.
Banks Nelson, when interviewed as to
why he acted as Time-keeper at a box
ing bou' here on Friday night.
â¢'Boxing Is one of the best exercises
for the lungs," he continued. "Our
boys in the parish houses frequently
put on gloves for friendly bouts. As
to my acting as time-keeper, that was
all a Joke. I was th* guest of a friend
at a Masonic entertainment in the Ma
sonic Temple. The manager of the
entertainment called a boxing bout aivl
as a Joke announced me as the timr
keeper. I accepted the situation in the
spirit in which it was given and held
the watch. It was a wholly innocent
and rr^per affairâ a part of the enter
tainment.
1 I don't see why a little incident
should makp such a stir. Boxing, prop
erly conducted, is a healthy exercise.
What's wrong with it? I used to put
on the gloves myself I recommend air
for ministers; it ia good for them to
g^? their wind up on."
Dr. Nelson is a fine specimen of
physical ability, as well as ministerial
manhood. He is about 37 ; years' of
age, Scotch born and is an' advocate
of the strenuous life. His topic to
day was "Some Old Fossils."

JOY IN TOKIO
Tie Pass Will Be
Scene of Next
Big Battle.
TOKIO, March 12. â Field Marshal
Oyama's official estimate of the Jap
anese losses in the recent battle places
the number at 41,030. The Japanese
captured a retreating column of Rus
sians at the Pu River on Saturday.
ST. PETERSBURG, March 12. â
General Kuropatkin's dispatch, an
nouncing that 1190 officers and 46,391
men are missing from roll call, is
taken to include only the killed and
prisoners, the Commandcr-in-ehief
adding: "'The wounded have been sent
north." It Is believed the Russian
losses will aggregate 130,000 men.
While General Kuropatkin appar
ently has succeeded in saving more of
his artillery than seemed possible, his
losses in men, ammunition and com
missariat supplies in the battle of Muk
den are far greater than earlier reports
indicated and even that portion of his
army which succeeded in extricating
itself from the positions around Muk
den is still in serious danger. The
Japanese generals realizing that with
a little more speed they could have in
flicted a crushing defeat on the Rus
sian army after the battle of Liaoyang,
determined not to allow again an op
portunity to pass and are following
after the defeated and sorely tried Rus
sian forces. While a small portion of
Kuropatkin's army has reached Tie
Pasfc, the greater part of thoae who
escaped from the battle of Mukden are
still struggling onward, being at last
accounts between twelve and sixteen
miles from their goal, with the Japa
nese harassing them from all sides.
Even should the remnant of the army
reach Tie Pass it is hardly possible for
it to make a stand there against the
overwhelming force opposing it, es
pecially as the Russians must be worn
out and weakened by the loss of men,
guns and ammunition.
It is more likely that General Kuro-
FP.tkin will fall back to Harbin with
what he can save and wait there for
the reinforcements that St. Petersburg
has already promised him. A possible
-ftstacle to the plan is General Kawa
inura's army, whiih has not yet been
located and which may also be heading
for the northern capital.
General Kuropatkin admits that 1190
officers ana 48.931 men are not respond
tng to roll calls. This is rather vague.
It may or may not include the thous
ands of wounded who have been sent
north, and again it may not include
the losses suffered by the third army,
with which the commander in chief
was not in communication for some
time. The figures given by the Japa-
IM se war office appear more reason
able; namely, 40,000 prisoners, 26,500
dead left on the field and 90,D00 killed
or- wounded, the latter figure, of course,
including tne dead found by the Japa
nese. The Russian losses, therefore,
trta'i about 130,000 menâ more than one
third of the whole army.
The fact that the Japanese report
the capture of only sixty guns indicates
that Kuropatkin, at the last moment,
io^eeeti^d in sending a considerable
portion of his artillery northward on
the railway.
The Japanese losses up to this morn
trig were reported as 41,222, not includ
ing the army which pushed north be
tween Mukden and Fushun.
TOKIO, March 12, 7 p. mâ The fol

Richmond.
Police Strike Fresh
Clew in Stanford
Case.
Woman's Admissions Starts
Detectives Out on a
New Sceat.
Elizabeth Richmond, the former maid
of the late Mrs. Stanford, h^s made a
startling admission to the police that
has suddenly heightened the interest
of the city's sleuths in the mystery sur
rounding the death of the philanthropic
lady and started the authorities on a
fresh hunt for clews that may result
in the arrest of the person or persons
guilty of the cowardly murder.
Under the terrible strain of cross
questioning to which she has been sub
jected by the head of the city's de
tective force, Miss Richmond had ad
mitted that she has been using strych
nine tablets for the purpose, so she
claims, of stimulating a weak heart.
She made the admission in the prea
ence of several officers detailed on the
strange case, but later, when shÂ« ap
parently realized the importance of the
statement, she suddenly added another
to the effect that she had )ieen/<rce\lsÂ«
tomed to the use of the strychnine tab
lets ever since she came to this coun
try, but had not used them since she
entered Mrs. Stanford's employ Her
exact words were to the effect that she
had a box of strychnine" tablets only
a short time before she was introduced
to Mrs. Stanford by Butier Beverly,
but destroyed them just before enter-
Ing upon her duties as maid.
DOUBT HER EXPLANATION'S.
Why Miss Richmond should have co
suddenly abandoned the use of the
drug, which she says had helped to
sustain her weak heart, she has not
fully explained to the police officials.
But, as a matter of fact, the police
claim that they are in possession of
facts to prove conclusively that Miss
Richmond did not abandon her strych
nine tablets unon becoming a member
of the Stanford household. On the con
trary, it is claimed by the police that
if the circumstances necessitate it
they will be able to prove that Miss
Richmond used, or at least had in her
possession, after beginning service with
Mrs. Stanford, a box of strychnine tab
lets.
What became :of this partially
emptied box of tablets? ,is one ques
tion over which ; the . police , are â¢ ponder
ing and are displaying a 'great deal: of
physical 'energy !to : ' determine. ' And
while working on this ; matter they are
trying to conceive some theory ; that
may eventually . â  connect Miss , Rich
mond's strychnine tablets with : the
death of her former mistress. ( *?"
Each additional day's investigation
of Mrs=. Stanford's death seems to re
veal some new and Ftrange circum
stance relating to Miss Richmond's
connection svith the Stanford house
hold, but the more the Investigation
proceeds the more frequently thÂ« de
tectives have to admit that they have
yet to gain a direct clew that will war
rant them in any way involving the
maid.
STILL UNDER I SUSPICION.
The fact is the police, so far, are
working only on the bare facts that
Miss Richmond was one of several
members of the household that
could easily gain , entrance to the
apartments of her mistress and that
she has made many contradictory
statements during her examinations
before the chief of detectives.
The latest development, the use by
Miss Richmond of strychnine tablets,
might prove a valuable piece of cir
cumstantial evidence were the maid on
trial for the poisoning of Mrs. Stanford.
but under present circumstances it does
no- "carry the weight that it would
had other and stronger evidence been
found against her. The strychnine dis
covered in the bottle of Poland water
was of a crystallized form, while the
strychnine In tablets Is in a powdered
condition and so infinitesimal in quan
tity that it would require a number of
the tablets to constitute a sufficient
poisoning dose to be administered In a
quart bottle of water.
SEARCHING DRUG STORES.
Nevertheless, the police dÂ«em it their j
duty to thoroughly investigate the cir
cumstance, and with that purpose in
view Detectives Wren and Dinan are
now making the rounds of the city I
drug stores and other places where
strychnine is sold, carefully looking
back over the registers for clews to
purchasers of strychnine tablets. They j
have already found many purchasers, >
but an investigation has satisfied them \
that the persons had no connections |
with any member of the Stanford
household or with any one who is re- â¢!
lated in any way with those who are |
under the shadow or police suspicion.

"I feel the position of the two wom
en keenly." he said. "I can imagine
how oppressed they must be living in
the same rooms where Mrs. Stanford
died."
Mrs. Stanford's trunks were also
brought to the Young Hotel. In re
gard to the suicide theory Mr. Hopkins
t*aid: "That idea is outrageous. I have
known th/> Stanford family for forty
years and I know that such a theory
is preposterous."

COTTAGE GROVE, March 12.â John
T'ranton, who wad arrested for the at

the morning of March 9, is believed to
tie another John Hoch. His three
wives all died under suspicious cir
cumstances, the first two bearing in
surance, the third having refused to
have her life insured on account of
i lie ugly rumors which circulated at
the time of the death of Branton's
fi 'finer wives.
Fletcher, who was found wounded on
the trail to Branton's ranch, also had
J^OOO insurance payable to Branton.
Branton has always been considered an
honest man, ,but suspicion rested on
him at the death of his third wife, who
is supposed to have died of strych
nine poisoning. A warrant for his ar
rest was issued at that time, but was
never served.
It was not until a day or two after
Fletcher had recovered sufficiently to
sty that he had attempted suicido as
Branton had reported, that the various
facts regarding Branton's history be

Linn County is aroused against him.
A great deal of circumstantial evi

to Branton as a seeker after dead

circumstances is held up against him
r.ow that he has been arrested for the
attempted murder of Fletcher for his

Kuropatkin Announces the Nuniher of
Men That Are Missing.
ST. PETERSBURG. March 12.â A
dispatch received here from General
Kuropatkin, dated Saturday, says:
"The night of March 10 (Friday)
passed without fighting on the front
of the Second army, which I am ac
companying. The rear guard of this
army, under General Guerschelman. is
holding the positions in the neighbor
hood of Chuchital station. T'p to 7
o'clock this morning no reports had
been received from Third army. The
positions of the First army were this
morning twenty-five to thirty versts
(about 17 to 20 miles) south-southwest
of Tie Pass."
Telegraphing at 30:40 o'clock on Sat
urday night General Kuropatkin re
ported as follows:
"To-day the enemy's attack was con
fined to the rear guard of the Third
Siberian corps. The First army.
echeloned in front of the other armies,
continues to retreat toward positions
indicated for all the armies. Accord-
Ing to a report from the commander of
the Third army, received to-day, his
rear guard occupied a position on the
Mandarin road sixteen and a half
miles from Tie Pass. Only a small de
tachment of the Japanese, mainly
cavalry, confronted this rear guard.
"From February 28 to March 11. in
clusive, 1190 officers and 46,391 men are
missing from roll call. The wounded
have been sent north."
ASKS TO BE RELIEVED.
Kuropatkin Pleads the Need of Physi
cal and Mental Rest.
LONDON. March 13.â The St. Peters
hure correspondent of the Times says:
"General Kuropatkln has asked the
Emperor's gracious permission to turn
over his command, alleging that he Is
in urgent need of physical and mental
rest.
"I learn on the best authority that
the Japanese twice have approached
Russia, through informal channels, on
the subject of peace negotiations, but
that in each case the proposal failed
because Japan demanded an Indemnity
and a pledge that Russia would not
keep warships in the Pacific for twen
ty-five years.
"The JapanecÂ© insistence on indem
nity convinces the Russian Government
that her pecuniary resources are ex
hausted and that, by continuing the
war only a few months longer, Russia
will get better terms.
"When Kuropatkin heard of the cap
ture of Kiousan on March 10 he real
ized that he had delayed retreat too
long. One desperate chance remained,
however. It was the sacrifice of his
artillery by massing the batteries so
ac to paralyze the enemy's fire. The
Russian gunners did their duty and
saved what is left of Kuropatkln's
army."

RUSSIA IS TO RAISE NEW ARMY
DEFEAT DISPELS
HOPE OF PEACE
Czar Orders Baltic Fleet to
Give Togo Battle.
ST. PETERSBURG, March 13, 2:30 a.
m.â The immediate answer of the Rus
sian Government to the defeat at Muk
4< n is the announcement that a new
army will be raised and the forces in
the Far East reorganized; that Vice
Admiral Rojestvensky will be ordered
to sail on and try conclusions with
Togo, and that the war will be prose
cuted to the bitter end.
This is the present temper of Emper
or Nicholas and his dominant advisers,
voiced in a firm official announcement
that the position of Russia is un
changed and that the initiative for.
peace can only come from Japan.
Should the island empire choose to
tender moderate terms and recognize
its adversary as the dominant Dower
Tn the Far East, peace could be easily
arranged; but the voice of her diplo
mats in various parts of the world in
dicate that she is not ready to do this
and the Russian Government, with the
full magnitude of the disaster at Muk
den still undetermined, but with the
1905 campaign seemingly already hope
lessly compromised, retreat to Harbin
inevitable and Vladivostok practically
lost, declares that the time has not
yet come when Russia can be forced
to humble herself.
It is reported that the dispatch of
two new army corps, including the
Fourteenth from Poland, and several
smaller units has already been de
termined upon and that plans for fur
ther mobilization are under discus
sion.
MUCH TALK OF PEACE.
But while this is the official attitude,
nothing but peace talk is heard In St.
Petersburg. The difficulties of another
mobilization on a large scale will be
enormous; in fact, it is stated in some
quarters that it will be impossible.
Nevertheless, it might be accomplished.
The real hope, however, for anything
; like a successful termination of the
! war is admitted to rest upon the pros
| pects of the financial exhaustion of
Japan. Russian resources, it is figured,
can stand the drain better than those
of Japan, and a protracted campaign,
it is hoped, will bring about Japan's
, financial ruin. Finance Minister Ko
: kovsoff, at the conclusion of a confer
ence of the national finances a few days
ago, is said to have tapped the table
before him and exclaimed:
, "We can win the war at this desk."
The Russian capital is still in
ignorance of the nature and extent of
the reverses in Manchuria. The only
information of its magnitude is that
which has been derived from the few
Tokio telegrams that have been -al- 1
lowed to be published here. To t,hÂ£
censor at Tie Pass the word "prisoner"
does not exist and not the slightest
intimation of what, if any. units and
organizations have been cut off and
captured has reached this city, either
in General Kuropatkln's official dis
patches or in reports from corres
| pondents at the front.
! LOOKING FOR ANOTHER CHIEF.
I Aside from the reports given out by
I the War Office there is practically no
further information of the progress of
: events, the newspaper dispatches re
ceived yesterday being principally
those filed before the retreat began and
transported to Tie Pass among the
papers of the telegraph office. It is
declared that the moment that General
Kuroki's wedge, aided by the dust
storm and taking advantage uf the
failure of several Russian organizations
to occupy appointed positions, drove
itself dppp into the Russian flank it
disarranged all the plans of General
Kuropatkin, who was on the point of
launching a momentous counter
Stroke; but where or how it was to be
accomplished is not stated.
General Kurnpatkin telegraphed to
Emperor Nicholas, assuming himself all
the responsibility for his defeat, mak
ing no excuses except that the strength
1 of the Japanese was miscalculated, and
refusing to place any of the blame
upon the council of generals, upon
whose advice he determined to give
battle. This manly course and the
general's personal exertions in direct
ing the retreat will, however, hardly
save him. His reputation as an offen
sive strategist is gone, and though the
Emperor's military advisers know not
where to look for a better general, his
I resignation will be accepted.
KI'ROPATKIN'S SUCCESSOR.
Tt will be difficult to find a capable
successor, but it is said now that it
probably will be General GroUekoff,
Governor of Amur, although in
casting about for another commander
in chief some military officials are
turning to General Dragomlroff, who
is considered to be Russia's greatest
strategist; but he is a feeble old man.
suffering with a heart affection, and
it is highly improbable that he would
be able even to make the long trip to
Manchuria.
In losing General Kuropatkin the
army will lose the Idol of the private
poldiers â an officer who, in spite of
the Intrigues of his generals and his
failure to win a battle, has won their
confidence and affection.
CAPTVRE OF KANKYACHTEN.
Successful Attack That Turned Rus-
sian Positions at Mukden.
GENERAL OKU'S HEADQUAR
TERS, Monday, March 6. â Kankya
ahien was captured this afternoon.
From a small hill two miles to the
west the advance and attack was
plainly visible. Kankyachien is a small
village in an angle two miles north and
fuur miles west of the railway.
At 3 o'clock General Oku left his
shelter tent and, mounted on his horse,
took his place on the summit of the
hill with his big field glasses. A few
minutes later the infantry attack be
gan. The lead had been given to a
famous division from Northern Japan.
The attack began with the advance
of a dozen men from Hankyach, the
village to the north, who rushed sev
eral hundred yards across the plain and
dropped behind a cover. They were
followed by another small section and
then by another. When about a com
pany had been assembled the advance
was continued in the same manner.
The Russians threw hundreds of
shells at the advancing men, cutting
them up badly, but not stopping the
advance. Scores of men dropped and
remained where they fell, while others
advanced, after which some painfully
returned to the starting point, braving
the Russian shells again. One party
of five started to return, but only one
of them arrived at the shelter.
At the same time an advance began
from the western village, men going
forward in the same manner. From an
old railway embankment a long column
straggled forward at wide intervals to
reinforce the western village. The
Russians shelled all the advancing men
unmercifully, killing or wounding
scores, but the advance never stopped.
A rifle flre from the village cut wide
gaps in the advance, but still the Jap
anese did not halt. The last third of
the distance the men could advance
only in shore rushes. Finally after the
last rush came the men disappeared
into the village. A few moments later
the telephone operator on the hill re
ported that the village had been cap
tured.
The Russians heavily bombarded
Kankyachien and a heavy fire was de
livered on several places, but with
out succeeding in dislodging the Jap
anese, who continued the attack on
other villages.
At nightfall, because of the taking of
this and nearby villages, Mukden was
as good as captured.
REORGANIZING THE ARMY.
Difficult Task Confronts Russian Of-
ficers at Tie Pass.
TIE PASS, March 13, noon. â The
Japanese, it is reported, have ceased
their pursuit, at least temporarily.
Some of the Japanese are twenty-five
miles below Tie Pass. A resumption
of their advance Is expected. Rumors
are in circulation that the Japanese
are already attempting another turn
ing movement to drive the Russians
from Tie Pass.
The- Russian troops here have been
arriving with hopelessly mixed units
in consequence of the change in the
front. The troops are being sorted out
and organizations reformed and as
signed to places to defend new posi
tions, but whether Tie Pass will be
held or abandoned probably will not
be decided for several days.
It is still too early to tell the extent
ot the Russian defeat, because not all
parts of the army have been assem
bled and the losses during the retreat
are no small proportion of the casual
ties. Up to the time of the beginning
of the retreat, it is probable the Jap
anese losses were heavier than those
of the Russians, and at the time the
Japanese broke through Fu Pass the
Russians appeared to be holding their
own and even gaining a little. Prepar
ations were then being made to
launch a counter stroke. The Japan
ese success was largely aided by the
weather conditions, which enabled
them to approach unobserved, but it
v.as chiefly due to the failure of some
of the organizations of the left flank
in the retirement from the Shakhe
River to occupy the positions marked
out for them. Thd Japanese quickly
discovered the intervals, scouting
columns having followed the retreat
closely.
A heavy column which had been
held in reserve for this eventuality
was quickly directed into the breach
an,<l burst asunder the Russian line,
rendering retreat inoperative. The
wonder is that the retreat did not de
generate into a panicky flight. In con
sequence of the rapid change of front
necessitated by the western attack, the
units of the army had become inextri
cably confused. Battalions were not in
their proper regiments; regiments
were not In their own divisions and
divisions were not In the corps to
which they properly belonged.
It Is easily to be comprehended that
the forced retirement became disor
dered to an extent by the sudden and
unexpected fire of a small detachment
of Japanese, probably not more than
two squadrons of a mountain battery,
which had slipped far inside the Rus
sian lines and opened on the retreat
ing transport, causing a temporary
panic. The panic, however, was chief
ly confined to the drivers and some
artillerymen, whose nerves had been
weakened by the strain of the twelve
days' battle and who cut the traces
and abandoned their wagons and guns.
A further detachment of the army,
however, came up and a portion of the
wagons and guns were saveU.
In the retreat of the first army, Gen
eral Rennenkampff, upon whose corps
fell the brunt of the fighting in the
TMnkhetchen operations, displayed
brilliant generalship, causing consider
able loss to the pursuing Japanese.
The decision of General Kuropatkin
to offer battle on the Shakhe River
was taken against his own best Judg
ment. He had been constantly blamed,
both in army circles and at home, for
operating without decision and the de
mand that he take the initiative and
abandon the policy of retirement was
voiced on all sides. It appears that
General Kuropatkin yielded to this
opinion, which was that of many of his
principal generals, and decided to give
battle, thereby losing the opportunity
for a more successful retreat before
the Japanese forces, which largely out
numbered the Russian army.

advancing. The Japanese are already
in touch with Tie Pass.
The Russian forces evidently are con
fused and exhausted and are possibly
short of food and ammunition, and it
is believed here that they will be un
able to resist a strong attack. Succeed
ing reports from the field increase the
extent of the Russian disaster, and it
is believed that it will require months
to resupply and reorganize the Russian
armies.
It is estimated that the Russian cas
ualties and captives will reach 40 per
cent, of the number engaged in the re
cent fighting. Their artillery losses es
pecially are heavy. The numerous
stores and munitions of war captured
are valued at millions of dollars. The
Russian loss materially adds to the
crippling of their armies.
The Japanese people are receiving
the details of their victory with calm
ness. Tokio and other cities are ex
ceedingly quiet. A recent admonition
to refrain from spending money in
celebrations and devote it to savings
and war charities is being generally
followed.
NO PEACE TERMS TO OFFER.
The press and leading men, discus
sing the possible effect of the recent
victory upon peace, declare that Japan
will continue a vigorous prosecution of
the war and that she has no sugges
tion to make to Russia, either directly
or 'ndirectly.
In the general elation over success,
the Japanese find a special source of
satisfaction in the celerity in flanking
operations, the quick seizure of advan
tages and the speed in pursuit mani
fested by their armies. After last
summer's campaign there was a gen
eral admission of the truth in the re
peated criticisms that the Japanese
troops failed In those respects, and
there was a general avowal of a de
termination to redeem these faults
during future operations.
Against the Russian left a portion of
the Fifth army marched forty miles in
one day, greatly aiding in the achieve
ment of victory.
The captives taken in the recent bat
tle will make the total Russian pris
oners taken during the war 75,000, and
the care of these prisoners is becoming
a large and expensive problem for the
Japanese Government. Plans are be
ing considered to establish military
prisons on the islands of the inland sea
to remove all the prisoners to them.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
KANSAS CITY. Mo.. March 11â
Cuthbert Powell, the commercial editor
of the Kansas City Journal for more
than a quarter of a century, in close
touch with the packing-house and live
stock interests of the WeÂ»t has pre-
pared an extended article based on ac- "
curate figures, showing that Commis
sioner Garfleld was In error when he
reported that the packers made a
profit of only 99 cents a head on cattle.
Powell shows that the average net
profit to the packers la $7 41 a head, or
15 per cent on the price of tha cattle,
and that this profit is turned every two
to four weeks, twelve to twenty-four
times a year.
"The following figure*," says Powell,
"are based upon the year's killing of a
big Western packing plant and repre
sent all grades coming to it during that
time. The by-products are as follows:

Powell figures that on each animal
: there remains a gross profit to
; the packer of $9 91 per head. There
is the general expense of the plant to
be accounted for, and $1 50 per head on
cattle must be allowed for this. There _*
Is still a net profit to the packer on his 1
cattle of $3 41, but to be absolutely fair "
with the packers, a further allowance
of $1 per head for maintenance of
| plants and extraordinary expenses is
made. Still there remains $7 41 per
, head net profit -to the packers.
"Applying the average profit of $7 41
on cattle. 20 cents on hogs. 50 cents on
sheep and 50 cents on calves to the
total number of head killed in a year
by the combined packing houses." says
Powell, "gives a total profit of S-T
412. Figuring upon their total caDitall
zation undoubtedly heavily watered of
$110,500,000, we have 43 per c^nt. which
is ten times what such money would
produce If loaned in large blocks upon
th? open market."
Besides this, the trust Is heavily In
terested in the stockyards at Kansas
City and Chicago, and owns outright
ptockyards at numerous other cities
together with private car lines, the
profits from which are undoubtedly as
large.

taking with it all the trunks of the pas
sengers, a lot of household furniture, â¢
piano and two locomotive trucks. At
the moment the steamer was actually
on her beam ends, and in another in
stant she would undoubtedly have gone
down. As soon as the weight on her
bows was released she righted, and the
frightened passengers, who had been
pitched about miscellaneously in their
stuffy staterooms, were enabled once
more to hold themselves in their berths.
SAFE ASHORE.
The steamer docked at Mission-street
wharf shortly after 2 o'clock. The woe
begone passengers presented a surry
aspect as they clambered down the
shaky gangplank to the dock.
The women passengers were very
much exhausted as a result of their
startling experience. While all were
grieved over the loss of their trunks
they were glad to reach land in safety.
Many of the unfortunates lost every
thing they pOMcased. Some of them
had their furniture with them and had
come prepared to settle in this city.
Mrs. John Manchester, who is an
invalid, had to be carried ashore. She
was made as comfortable ag possible
in the freight clerk's office on the
wharf, pending the arrival of an am
bulance, when 6he was conveyed to the
Lane Hospital. A great crowd had
collected on the dock, and viewed with
interest the debarking of the demoral
ized passengers.
Captain Charles Ellefsen, master of
the Brunswick, made light of his ex
perience. He said:
"Oh, it wap nothing out of the ordi
nary. We had a little wind, but the
sea was not rough. I don't want to
Bay anything about the trip. I sup
pose the passengers will all be coming
in for big damages for the loss of.
their trunks and their belongings. That
the baggage went overboard was no
fault of mine. It is all bosh to say I
ordered the lashings cut to save the
boat from sinking. She listed a little
and the forward deckload went over
board."
TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE.
Mrs. S. A. Kapple, one of the pas
sengers, said: "Oh, it was something
terrible. I thought at 2 o'clock this
morning we were all going to the bot
tom. I was awfully seasick, but I was
aware of the danger we were in. I
have lost everything. All my trunks
and my furniture were swept over
board. I don't know what to do."
Charles Kapple, another passenger,
said: "I don't know how to relate the
story of this trip. Some of the crew
told me the boat was overloaded. Of
course, I don't know about that, but 1
do know that she almost stood on end
at times, and until the load on her
bow was cut away she was flooded
with water."
The Brunswick was twenty-two
hours from Fort Bragg. Her usual
time is about fourteen hours. She is
2T5 tons burden, and brings lumber
and ties to the Union Lumber Com
pany. She had forty-one passengers.
SEVERE .STORM VISITS COAST.
Much Damage Is I>one tn the Interior
of the State.
One of the liveliest storms of the
season visited the Pacific Coast from
Pupet Sound to Los Angeles yes
terday. The wind blew at the rate of
100 miles an hour in some localities.
Heavy rains fell throughout the day
?nd night. The heaviest precipitations
vÂ«?re recorded at Red Bluff and Los
Angeles.
The storm came from Western Ore
gon, and quickly blew along the entire
California coast. The wind was un
uf-uaily strong and blew from the
southeast. Much damaee was done In

the interior, especially to the telegraph
lines, most of which were blown down
by the high wind that prevailed all
through Saturday night and yesterday
norning and afternoon.
Weather Forecaster McAdie reported
severe windstorms, accompanied by
heavy rains, in the Sacramento and San
Joaquin valleys. He says the Sacra
mento River is sure to run high this
afternoon and may overflow in the
vicinity of Red Bluff, where the rain
has been unusually heavy, one inch
and a twentieth having fallen there in
twenty-four hours up to 6 o'clock last
night.
In Los Angeles and San Bernardino
the rainfall was very heavy. One inch
Cell in Los Angeles up to 6 o'clock last
night and nearly that much in San
Ltrnardino. The wind in the two
places blew at the rate of thirty-six
miles an hour. No reports were re
ceived from Fresno or San Diego, ow
ing to the wrecking of the telegraph
v.l res.
The wind in this city blew at the
rate of thirty-eight miles an hour and
kept up steadily all day. Off Point
Reyes the gale developed a velocity of
li><> miles an hour, at Mount Tamalpias
seventy was registered, while off the
Farallones the gale averaged seventy
two miles an hour. Reports from the
southern part of the State show the
velocity there to have been from thirty
two to thirty-eight miles an hour.
McAdie looks for more rain to-day,
accompanied by heavy winds. The
storm prevailed throughout Washing
ton and parts of Oregon as well as in
this State. It is expected that the
rainfall to-day in the southern part of
the State will be heavy and that sec
tion will receive its much needed
drenching before the storm breaks up.
FURY OF THE SEA.
Several Hundred Sightseers Brave
Elements to Visit Beach.
Huge masses of flying scud, a heavy
surf that broke in spray over the Seal
Rocks and along the shore furnished
the attraction at the beach yesterday,
and those who took the windy jour
ney were well repaid for their trouble.
A steady southeaster that whipped the
ocean into a fury at times, blew all
day long and being an off-shore breeze
precluded the chance of any wreck.
Captain Varney and his staunch men
of the Golden Gate Station were on
the alert for the unexpected, but It
failed to appear.
A few hundred sightseers braved the
.weather to reach the beach, while a
straggling few wandered over the ball
grounds in the park hoping to see a
game. Automobilists and those hav
ing trotters spent the greater part of
their time in the beach taverns.
GRAIN MEN SMILING.
Storm Hurts Fruit Trees, but Bene-

FRESNO, March 12.â The most op
portune and at the same time the most
destructive rain of the season began to
fall this morning. During the after
noon the storm increased. Rain came
down in sheets and a heavy wind cre
ated havoc with fences and fruit trees.
The greatest damage is to the decidu
ous crop. The apricot and peach trees
are in blossom and the rain and wind
have united in littering the ground
with petals. Horticultural men say
that while the damage is heavy the
havoc has not been sufficient to permit
the statement that the crop is entirely
ruined. Many trees are not yet in
bloom.

AID FOX IMMIGRANT
Chief Executive Points Out
Necessity of Spiritual
Help for the Newcomer
WASHINGTON, March 12. â The
Washington meeting of the American
Tract Society was held to-day in the
President's church, the Grace Re
formed Church, Rev. Mr. Schick, pas
tor. Justice Brewer, honorary vice
president, presided and made a brief
address, setting forth the important
work carried forward by the society.
President Roosevelt delivered the ad
dress and the Rev. Judson Swift, field
secretary at New York, made a report.
The report stated that the society
would celebrate its eighth anniversary
in May next; that the immigrants were
coming to the United States in in
creasing numbers and if the average
for the last month continued, the mil
lion mark would be reached for the
year. The society takes a special in
terest in the spiritual welfare of the
immigrant.
The call for the society's special and
unique work, the report says, is greater
than ever before in its history and its
rt sources are greatly overtaxed. A
most earnest appeal is made for in
creased gifts.
The President spoke in part as
fellows:
ADDRESS OF PRESIDENT.
I am glad, on behalf of this church, to say
I amen to the appeal that has been made by
i Dr. Swift on behalf of the great society. Mr.
; Justice, you quoted the advice of a poet, to
Ibe "doers rather than dreamers." In the
I book of all books, there is a sentence to the
same effect: "Be ye doers of the word and
net hearers only." Let us show ourselves to
! day doera of the word, upholding In fact what
i has been preached to us by Dr. Swift.
This church, more than others, should ever
keep before It' as on? of the chief parts of Its
I duty, that of caring in all ways, but especially
j In spiritual ways, for the people who come to
us from abroad.
The United States Government does en
deavor to do its duty by the immigrants who
come to Its shores, but unless people have had
some experience with the dangers and diffi
culties surrounding the newly arrived Immi
grant they can hardly realize how great
i they are. He is exposed to innumerable temp
tations, innumerable petty oppressions, on al
most *vÂ«ry hand; ana unless some one Is on
* hand to help him he literally has no idea
where to turn.
No greater work can be done by a philan
thropic or religious society than to stretch out
the helping hand to tlve man and the woman
who come to this country to become citizens
and the parent? of citizens, and therefore to
I do their part in making for the future of our
land. If we do not take care of them; if
' we do not try to uplift them then, as sure
I us fate as our own children will pay the
penalty. If we do not see that the Immigrant
and the children of the immigrant are raised
] up. most assuredly our own children, and our
' children's children are pulled down. Either
wheat and barley, already suffering,
would have been past redemption. The
rain means money for the grain men
and loss to the fruitgrowers.
RAIN IN NICK OF TIME.
Sacramento Valley Farmers Welcome
Heavy Downpour.
SACRAMENTO, March 12.â About
three-quarters of an inch of rain fell
to-day. The storm extended over all
this part of the Sacramento Valley,
doing great good to the farmers and
fruitgrowers. The season thus far has
been ideal in every- respect and this
rain comes exactly in the nick of time,
suiting all interests.
The river is quite low, being only
eighteen feet and six inches, and there
is not the slightest danger of any de
structive freshet this year, as it could
easily stand twenty-seven feet without
straining the levees. Less damage was
done by high water this season than
for many years. The outlook for abun
dant crops is good.
BIG SHIP ADRIFT.
U. S. S. Relief Blown From Moorings
Off Mare Island.
VALLEJO, March 12.â One of the
fiercest gales that has ever swept over
San Pablo Bay made the lives of ship
ping men anything but pleasant to
day. The United States steamship Re
lief, which has been moored in the
channel off Mare Island Navy Yard,
broke from her anchorage this after
noon and was being swept by the wind
up Napa Creek when a tug sent out
from the navy yard fastened te. line to
the big ship and brought her back to
her anchorage.
GOOD CROPS ASSURED.
Visalia Farmers Welcome Storm
Though Some Damage is Done.
VISALIA, March 12. â A wind and
rain storm of unusual severity broke
over Visalia at noon to-day. Trees
were blown down, several skylights
were â wrecked and many frame build
ings were damaged. About two inch
es of rain fell. The Mount Whitney
power company's lines were damaged.
It required six hours to make repairs.
This rain insures good crops and the
farmers are accordingly jubilant.
FARMERS ARE PLEASED.
Thirsty Soil in San Joaquin Valley Gets
Drenching.
STOCKTON, March 12.â The storm
which has been brewing for several
days burst furiously over Stockton this
forenoon and the thirsty soil received
the drenching it was greatly In need of.
Reports are to the effect that the storm
is general over most c-f the San Joaquin
country. Crop prospects have been
bright all along, but the present storm
makes the outlook even brighter.
TRAINS ARE DELAYED.
Heavy Storm Damages Railroad in

BAKERSFIELD, March 12. â It has

downpour has been general all over
the country. From points in the Te

ceived that the rainfall is very heavy.
Damage has been done on the rail
road. At Keane a washout has oc

tions no train will move south of
Bakersfleld this evening.

WILLOWS, March 12.â This after
noon the wind became so fierce that it
blew down a large 4000-ton warehouse
at Logandale switch, six miles below
Willows. The wreckage blocked all
traffic for some time and delayed the
Oreeon exsress.
OLD MAN KILLS
FARM LABORER
Midnight Tragedy in a Sa
loon Three Miles East of
the City of Marysville
XO WITNESSES TO DEED
Slayer, When Arrested by
Sheriff of Yuba County,
Says He Shot in Self -Defense
MARYSVILLE, March 12.â Shortly
after midnight last night William P.
Slusser, a bartender at the Yuba Dam
saloon, three miles east of Marysville,
shot and killed Schuyler C. Douglass, a
farm laborer employed in the neighbor
hood. There was no witness to the
tragedy.
Slusser claims he shot in self-defense.
After the shooting he called "Jake"
Morrison from his ' room and left him
with the body of Douglass while he
came to his home in Marysville. Sheriff
Voss and Police Officers Sayles and
Becker arrested him a few hours after
his arrival.
Slusser is past sixty years of age and
his victim was about forty. Douglass

they will rise or we shall sink. The lerel of
v.ell being in this country will be a level for
all of us.
We cannot kÂ»pp that level down for a part
and not have :t sink more or lees for the
whole. If we raise It for a part, we shall
raise It to a certain extent for the whole.
Therefore It means much, not merely to the
immigrants, but to every good American, that
there should be at Ellis Island the colporteurs
of this city, and the representatives of other
religious and philanthropic societies to try to
ear* for the Immigrant's body, and above all
to try to care for the Immigrant's soul.
It Is. of course, unnecessary to say that the
things of the body must be cared for; that
the first duty of any man, especially of the
man who has others dependent upon him, is
to take care of them, and to take care of him
self. Â£>.eh man must be able to pull his own
weight, to carry his own weight; and there
fore each man must show the capacity to
earn for himself and his family enough to
secure c certain amount of material well being.
That must be the foundation. But on that
foundation he must build as a superstructure
the spiritual life.
It Is a good thing to have had the extraor
dinary material prosperity which has followed
so largely on the extraordinary scientific dis
coveries alluded to by Justice Brewer. If we
use this material prosperity aright. It is not
a good thing, it is a bad thing, If we treat
it as the end of all of our life. If we make
it the only Ideal before this nation, If we per
mit the people of this republic to get before
their minds the view that material well-being
carried to an ever higher degree Is the one
and only thing to be striven for, we are lay
injr up for ourselves not merely trouble, but
ruin.
BIG PROBLEMS BEFORE CS.
I, too, feel the faith and hopes that have
been expressed here to-day by the vice presi
dent and the secretary of the society, but I
feel because I believe that we shall not permit
mere material well-being to become the only
ideal of the nation, because I believe that
more and more we shall accustom ourselves
to looking at the great fortunes accumulated
by certain men as being nothing In themselves,
either to admire, to envy or to deplore, save
as they used well or ill. If the great fortune
is used well, if the mai? who has accumulated
it has the strength necessary to resist the
temptation either to use It wrongfully or, what
Is nearly aÂ» bad, not to use It rightly, he Is
entitled to the praise due to whoever employs
great powers for the common good.
If the man who accumulates that great for
tune Ã¼bcs It 111 or doss not use It well, then so
far from being an object of envy, still less an
object of admiration, he should take his place
among those whom we condemn and pity. If
he uses it aright, then he is entitled to our
admiration, our respÂ»ct, exactly as every man
is entitled to it if he has special talents and
uses those special talents for the welfare of
the people as a whole, for the uplifting of
mankind.
Wonderful changes have . come In " the last
half century. It may. be well, as Mr. Justice
Brewer has said, | that we tremble on the verge
of .still greater changes In ; the future. The
railway, the telegraph, the . telephone." steam,
electricity, all the marvelous mechanical In
ventions, have changed much In the superficial
aspect of the world and have, therefore, pro
duced certain great changes in the world it
self. But after all. In glorying over and won
dering at this extraordinary development, I
think that we sometimes forget that, compared
to the deeper things. It Is Indeed only super
ficial In its effect. The qualities that count
most- In man and In woman now are the quali
ties that counted most 2000 years ago, and as
a nation we shall" achieve success or merit ac
cordingly :as we .do or do not display those
Qualities. â¢ â  â¢ * Â«

WOUND FATAL
Tragedy Occurs on
Farm in Pfacer
County.
Special Dispatch to The CmlL
LINCOLN, March. 12. â M. S. Nls
sen, a fruit rancher near Lincoln, was
shot this afternoon by his fourteen
jvar old son Claus. Nisson, who was
in the habit of abusing his wife, was
in pursuit of her when her screams
attracted the attention of her son who
was near by. The boy hastily grabbed
a double barreled shotgun and from
a distance of twelve feet deliberately
fired at his father. The shot took ef
fect in Nlssen'a back, inflicting a mor
tal wound.
After the shooting the boy ran to a
neighbor's house and told of his deed.
Several persons were soon on the scene
ot the tragedy. Doctors were sum
moned and the wounded man was re
moved to the county hospital. There
is no hope for his recovery.
The boy surrendered himself to Con
stable Lasswell. He has the sym

dren.
Nlssen senior is about 50 years old
and has a family of six children. The
son Claus warned his father that he
would kill him if he continued to
abuse his wife.

INQUIRY INTO
LANDS IN UTAH
Hundreds of Thousands of
Acres Said to Have Been
Grabbed by Corporations
QUESTIONABLE METHODS
Valuable Coal Property Has
Been Secured at Prices
of Agricultural Holdings
SALT LAKE, Utah, March 12.âSpe
cial agents of the Federal Government
are reported to have been engaged for
some time past in investigating publio
land frauds in Utah. The Salt L*k*
Herald to-day states that hundreds of
thousands of acres of valuable coal
lands have been acquired by corpora
tions by questionable methods. Vut
tracts of coal land are said to have
been filed on and patented as agricul
tural and grazing lands and then trans
ferred to coal companies. In many in
stances, it is stated, lands have be* a
filed on as coal lands, under the law
which permits every adult citizen to
acquire 160 acres of coal lands by pur
chase, upon payment of ten dollars &a
acre for such lands, when situated
more than fifteen miles from any rail
road, and twenty dollars an acre whan
situated within fifteen miles of a rail
road. Later these filings have beÂ«n
allowed to iar>se and the same lands
have been acquired as agricultural or
grazing lands at $1 50 an acre. MorÂ«
than two thousand of these coal entries
have been made tn tna Salt Lake land
office, but not more than one In fifty
of the persons who made the filings
have completed the purchase, the fil
ings lapsing and title being secured as
agricultural or grazing land from the
State land office through State land
selections.
Forty filings made in 1901 within a
period Of sixty days have recently
been investigated and thirty of the
forty claimants are found to have been
represented by an employe of a big
coal corporation, exercising a power of
attorney. The land was filed on and
held for fourteen months, as is permit
ted under the law, without being paid
for, but In none of these cases was
the purchase completed, title being
acquired through theNState land office
at a nominal figure under proceedings
instituted while th<Â» land was covered
by the coal lands tilings.

MRS. WHEELER WILL
TALK OF CHAPERONS
To ConferWitJiSamuelson Wisdom
of the Sacramento Tour.
Berkeley Office San Francisco" Call, |
2148 Center street. March li.', j [ ]
Arrangements were made to-day for \
a conference between Mrs. Benjamin 'jj
Ide Wheeler, wife of th president of
the university, and MervynJ. Samuels, j
manager of the Prytanean .Society's
production of the "Mikado." to take
place at Mrs. Wheeler's home at 10
o'clock to-morrow morning, when the ,
vexed question of the co-eds' trip to
Sacramento will be discussed, and per
haps settled. ;
: Mrs. .; Wheeler:_vbiced her opposition I
yesterday to the proposed journey of
the' "Mikado" cast Miss Ethel Rkh- :
j urdson and Miss Florence Fortson, who
are respectively : president of the As- :>
sociated Women Students of th? uni,-, ,
veraity and president of the Prytanean I
Society. Her disapproval was couched
in the form of a question, contained
substantially in the following words:
"Do you young ladies think it well
for women students of the university
to travel about the country, away from j
I the ' university, to give operatic per
formances, such as you contemplate I
giving at Sacramento?" .
That question, tentative though, it
was, served to start the agitation now
on, regarding the co-eds' trip to the
capital city, and the agitation prom
ises to embroil pretty nearly every
section of the university.
It is largely a question of chaperon-
I age, apparently, though Mrs. Wheeler
declines to commit herself on that
point. She said to-day: . â¢

Collegians Bring Their Com
rade Dp From S*ik Jose
in Flying "Devil Wagon"
Berkeley Office San Francisco Call,
2148 Canter street. March 12.
Undaunted by his arrest i>n a criminal
charge preferred by Miss Corine
Barry of Berkeley, Lewis E. Bulkeley
rode into town in an automobile this
afternoon, having made the Journey, m
company with a party of college men.
fiom San Jose, where he was arrested,
yesterday. The collegians repreÂ»ented
friends of Bulkeley and Miss Barry.
They rode to 9an Jose last night in an
automobile hired in Oakland, their mis
sion being to persuade Bulkeley to re
turn to the university town and make
Miss Barry his wife.
After conferences to-day, lasting {or
hours, Bulkeley consented to wed Cor
inne Barry, and the ceremony was per
formed during the evening by Justice
Edgar at the home of Miss Barry's
mother, Mrs. Ada B. Hent, 1338 Shat
tuck avenue.
Always calm and self- possessed.
Bulkeley listened thia morning; in San
Jose to the arguments of the college
men who had taken the midnight ride
in an automobile, and discussed coolly
the reasons why he should and why he
should not hasten back to Berkeley and
become a husband.
Bulkeley finally consented to return,
and by the time Berkeley was reached
was as before the swaggering Beau
Brummel of the college town. The
gravity of his position seemed to bother
him but little, though his friends re
minded him that at 10 o'clock on Mon
day morning he was due to face a
felony charge in the court of Justice
Edgar of Berkeley.
When urged to wed Miss Barry at
once. Bulkeley declared that he must
first see his attorney, an Oakland law
yer, whose name he refused to reveal.
Ho promised to meet the delegation
which brought him up from San Jose
at Berkeley this afternoon, after con
sulting with his attorney. At 3 o'clock
a conference between Bulkeley and his
personal friends and friends of Miss
barry's family was held and for two
hours the subject of the marriage was
debated.
Miss Barry, critically |U, awaited the
result of this conference. She denied
herself to all inquiries, her brother,
Arthur, assuming charge of the house
hold.
At 5 o'clock word was sent to the
Barry home that Bulkeley had agreed
to wed, and that a licenae would be ob
tained at once. Justice Edgar was sent
for, and the ceremony waa performed
at the home of the bride.
- - Bulkeley . explained â  that . most of . the
delay was due to his desire to
straighten out an affair between him
self and Miss Marjorie Fargo, of Red
lands, to whom he was engaged. Ap
parently he satisfied himself that all
v as clear in that quarter, and then the
marriage ceremony with Miss Barry
was accomplished.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, MARCH 13, 1905
FUGITIVE TAKEN
BY OAKLANDERS
Deputy Sheriff Moffat Cap
tures Harry Richards, a
Desperate Escaped Thief
18 GIVEN TWO DOLLARS
â  â â¦â -- â
Cobuin K cwards the Hero
Generously According to
His Own Idea of It
Sheriff Coburn, the alert official from
Riverside, will not return to his town
folk with explanations as to why Con
vict Harry Richards was not recap
tured after having jumped from a train
on Saturday morning. Thanks to the
fleetfootedness of Deputy Sheriff Wil
liam J. Moffat of Oakland, Richards
was run to earth in the marshes near
San Mateo several hours after his es
cape and now languishes behind the
prison bars at San Quentin.
Moffat was a passenger on the train >
and when he saw Richards loosen his '
handcuff anft jump through the win- '
dow, he was the first to follow. Co- |
burn and his yosse were left milea be- j
hind by the alert man from Oakland. :
For two hours he trudged through the
marshes and finally spied Richards
hiding in a deserted lagoon near San â 
Mateo.
iloffat ordered the man to surrender.
emphasizing his command with a
couple of shots into the air. Richards
yaw i he game was up and decided to
surrender \\ ithout making a fight.
Moffat returned to San Matea and
there found Coburr., who insisted that
the Oakland man hold on to the fugi
tive till the Tiburon ferry was reached.
Then the Southern official developed
a generous streak that surprised every
body, especially the brave man who
brought back the prisoner. Digging
down into hie pocket the kind-hearted
Coburn sorted out the fabulous sum
of $2 and with profuse thanks handed
It to Moffat. The latter was so over
come with gratitude that he could not
find words to thank his benefactor for
su<-h a magnificent gift.
Richards is but 24 years of age and
is a veritable giant, weighing 190
poundr. He will be compelled to serve
two years at San Quentin for the theft
of a bicycle in Riverside about three
weeks ago. It was thought Richards'
pals were waiting here to aid him, but
no trace of them has as yet been dte
covered and th^y failed to render hl\n
any aid.
FIND SURE CURE
FOR DYSENTERY
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, March 12.â 8y util
izing the despised vermiform appendix
to Introduce a quinine solution dh-ectly
ir.to the intestines, the surgeons in the
Washington Barracks Hospital believe
they have found a sure method of cur
ing tropical dysentery, the scourge of
the army in the Philippines.
This mysterious organ is reached by
means of an incision in the walls of
the abdomen. It is then drawn out
through the incision. The next step Is
to Inject through the appendix into the
large intestines a solution of quinine,
flushing the lower intestines with the
germicidal and healing stream with
out affecting the stomach or interfer
ing with its functions.
The treatment has been employed
successfully in the case of Sergeant
Mould of the engineer corps, who is
recovering in the Barracks Hospital
here from a Severe attack of dysentery,
contracted in the Philippines.

MANY BILLS IN HANDS
OF GOVERNOR.
SOME OF IMPORTANCE
MUST ACT IN PEW DAYS
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO. March j 2.â There is
no one in California who would envy-
Governor Pardee the job now before
him end with which he must wrestle
for the next few days â that of passing
upon the several hundred bills from the
last LegiÃlature still In his hands and
approving those he deema worthy. Some
of the measures may be very bad ones
and the Governor must know that each
Is keenly scrutinized before his name
goes on it. Some are very good ones,
and it is just as necessary that their
merits be not overlooked.
As pointed out by Governor Pardee
in his closing message to the Legisla
ture, there is no question that the
greatest work accomplished will inaug
urate the gigantic engineering feat of
reclaiming the inundated lands of the
Sacramento and San Joaquin valleys.
Though this bill has not as yet been
siyned by Governor Pardee it will be
within the next few days. This bill
establishes a board of trustees of a
great reclamation district, carries a
sufficient appropriation to insure the
proper inauguration c-f the work and
provides for v system of assessments
that will in time insure the reclamation
of hundreds cf thousands of acres that
surpass in richness the famed valley of
the Nile.
11YDROGRAPHIC WORK.
Another bill of almost equal impor
tance to the State is that carrying an
appropriation of $75,000 to balance a
like appropriation by the Federal Gov
ernment for carrying on the work of
tin- hydrographic, topographic and for
estry departments of the State. This
work deals essentially with the ques
tion of the reclamation of the arid and
semi-arid lands uf the southern portion
of the State.
Appropriations for the carrying on
of the horticultural, viticultural and
agricultural experiments are also im
portant, including a plan for the inves
tigation of the growth of the walnut in
various portions of the State and the
ravages of pear blight. But they are
not more important than the plan pro
vided'for the investigation of the condi
tion of the creals of the State. The bill
providing for the latter work estab
lishes a commission to investigate the
causes of the small percentage of glu
ten in the California cereals and pro
vides for the remedying of the evil as
soon as a remedy can be suggested by
the scientists that will carry the inves
tigation through to a definite result.
And bills providing for the educa
tion of the rising generation that will
till the lands that are to be reclaimed
for the use of man are among the im
portant measures adopted. One pro
vides for the appropriation of $150,000
for the purchase of an agricultural
farm to be operated by the agricultural
department of the University of Cali
fornia. Another provides for the ap
propriation of $ir,0,000 for the erection
of a building on the campus at the Uni
versity of California for the use of the
theoretical department of the college
of agriculture. Still another carries an
appropriation to rebuild the station of
the forestry department of the univer
sity at Santa Monica.
PRISON IMPROVES:. Â»TS.
The decision of the Legislature to re
vise the State Prison acts and to re
construct the two great penitentiaries
of the State will also meet with general
approval. Governor Pardee will sign
the McKenney bills, covering these re
forms, without question, as he strongly
favored the polfcy that resulted in
their passage. One provides for the
appropriation of more than $500,000 for
the construction of 800 additional cells
at each of the prisons, the extension
of the wall at San Quentln and the
construction of a new wall entirely
around Folsom prison. The prison acts
were also changed so as to make San
Quentln a prison for first offenders be
yond the age of 30, Folsom a prison
for incorrigibles and the Preston School
'of Industry the place of confinement
for all male offenders over the age of
16 and under 30, and Whittier School
an institu^on for the training of lads
under 16 years that have offended. An
other bill In the Governor's hands pro
vides for the placing of the girl in
mates of Whittier in private institu
tions and humej.
Interesting to all taxpayers are sev
eral bills that will receive the approval
of the Governor. A tax commission has
bÂ»pn created, and during the two years
that intervene between now and the
next session of the Legislature this
commission will busy itself with an in
vestigation of the revenue laws and
suggest advantageous changes. The
Legislature that has just concluded its
labors provided for a direct inheritance
tax, a life Insurance tax and a corpor
ation license tax. It Is certain that
these acts will yield a large revenue,
and that the commission will find other
mean?? to Increase the revenue of the
State when the next session convenes.
EDUCATIONAL. BILLS.
. . From the : standpoint of ; general : in
terest the educational bills, perhaps,
are in : the , lead. One of : wide Impor
tance is that providing for ; the redis
tribution :of the moneys of the State
among the counties. Another appropri
ates ; $150,000 . for ? the t construction \ of r a
new building 1 for the ,; ; State .- Normal

by both houses and ; that are now in the

proval are ; the â¢ following: v
_-' An act to legalize the titles to . State lands

NIGHT SCHOOL FOR BOYS
EMPLOYED BY TURFMEN
Coney Island Jockey Club Will Give
the Lads a Chance to Get
an Education.
NEW YORK, March 12.â The Coney
I&iand Jockey Club will start a night
school next winter for exercise boys
employed at the various stables quar
tered at the Sheepshead Bay track.
Ac there is no night school in that vi
cinity, the managers of the club be
llove it advisable to give the sprouting
minds of the stable lads a chance to
shoot. They believe education will
improve the morals of the stable at
tendants and prepare their walks of
life when the boys become too heavy
to ride.
The Coney Island Jockey Club has
purchased the old Dutch Reformed
Church, situated on th<> Neck road,
and it probably will be in this building
that the scholars will meet.

BOOTH'S NEPHEW
IS GOOD ACTOR
He Stars With Great Credit
in "Monsieur Beaucaire"
at the California Theater
PLEASING HIGH COMEDY
Those Desiring to Enjoy
Skillful Presentation of
Play Should See Clarke
Those that stayed away from the
California last night â and they were a
large and canny crowd â missed in
Monsieur Beaucaire" one of the pret
tiest high comedies seen here for a
long space, one does not blame the
absent crowd. The gods have dealt
hardly with the California of late.
There has been much of nothinK that ;
one wanted to see, and the Sunday
nighter haÃ "got on to' the fact. But
with "Monsieur Beaucaire." excellently
acted by Creston Clarke and his com
pany, the long lane has turned. The
rankest lbsenite will enjoy, and the I
matinee lass adore it.
matinee lass adore it.
Of course everyone knows the
sprightly story of Booth Tarkinston.
The piay follows it closely. The
serious-minded person will no doubt
object to the happy ending that is
thrust upon him, and the rest of us
would not mind seeing the snobbish
Lady Mary get her deserts. At least
one would have enjoyed her barber
duke lover insisting on introducing a
shaving brush rampant into the family
coat of arms! However, the whole
thing is in a very pretty and witty
spirit of romance. Bath, the one time
cmter of fashion and foppishness, is
the scene of the story; a French Duke
in disguise is its hero, and the
â¢proudest lady in England" its hero
ine. The Duke has run away from"
France to escape a made-to-order mar
riage, accompanying a French noble as
his barber. He is recognized in Bath
as the barber, becomes then a gambler
in order to entrap the cheating Duke
of Winterset, whom, on discovery, he
compels to introduce him into polite
society and to Lady Mary Carlisle. He
romantically imagines that the lady
will forgive his supposed low birth for
his courage and charm â but she de
clines the honor. However, as the
Duke, he wins her. The play is excel
lently put together, deftly, adroitly
made, and the lines are clever and
piquant throughout.
Crestofi Clarke, v.ho essays the title
role, comes by his decided dramatic
gift with all honesty. He Is a net hew
of Edwin Booth, and himself very fa
vorably known as * a Shakespearean
actor. His Beaucaire is delightful. To
begin with, Mr. Clarke's French seems
to have been made in France, and not
in Hoboken where so much of the staee
French seems to come from. The
whole thing is vividly French, supple,
flexible, elegant, distinguished. Mr.
Clarke, too, contrives to give very hap
pily the poetic side of the disguised .
Duke, the charming romanticism, the '
gay lovableness. and altogether shows
himself an actor of exceptional ac
complishment. In the pointed, witty
and easy delivery of the lines this is
particularly evident.
And the supporting company is Rood, !
excellent In the case of Frank McDon- I
aid, who gives a capital and hierhlv
convincing portrait of the scamp and
bully, the Duke of Winterset. Roy
Clements is a sincere and realistic
Molyneaux, and the men of the cast all
have manner, working together most '
harmoniously for the ensemble. Miss
Agnes Ardeck lacks something of in
dividuality as Lady Mary, but neverthe
less posseses considerable charm and
importantly, here, good looks. Blanche
Moulton is pungently amusing as the
scandal-mongering Countess, and the
rest of the cast is useful. There is
some pretty dancing and a truly excit
ing fight among the play's other at
tractions, with mountings that would
do every credit to the Columbia. In
fact the box office could safely offer
money back for "Monsieur Beaucaire"
and lose nothing.
BLANCHE PARTINGTON.
â r Â» â¢
Two "stunts" on the Orpheum pro- '
gramme are well worth the price of
admission, with the others thrown in
fcr good measure. Murphy and Fran
cis, a negro comedy couple, are top- 'â 
liners in their work. With Willy Zim
merman, in impersonations, they are
the hits of the evening. Mabel Me- I
Kinley introduces a new song, written
by herself, entitled "Arcadia," mean- '
I ing, of course, California.
Two new sketches are also in the list
pf attractions. The first to appear was
thai of Arthur Borani and Aanie Ne
varo, in "Weary Waggles, " in contor
tionistic and acrobatic work of no
mean ability. Clayton White. Marie
Stuart and Adelaide Knowlton were
clever in a fair sketch, entitled
"Dickie. "
The four sensational Boises. in aerial
acrobatics, and the motion picturng,
depicting automobiles breaking rec
ords on the beach in Florida, occupied
the entire third act. The holdover
acts from last week are thr Mnllory
brothers; Brooks and Holliday; P

BETTER BUSINESS METHODS.
COMMERCIAL conditions are still monotonous and featureless
throughout the country. There is nothing anywhere to call
for particular comment. For some weeks the United States
has been doing business in the European way â without hurry or
bustle. The recent traffic blockades due to the February storms have
al! been lifted, once more permitting a normal distribution of gen
eral merchandise, and the improved weather conditions have been
exhibited during the past fortnight in very large bank clearings
from one end of the country to the other. Those for the past week
were 57.5 per cent greater than for the corresponding week last year,
with all the important cities except Xew Orleans and Milwaukee
showing a gain, but the aggregate clearings, while large, exceeding
52.750.000.000. did not reach the record figures of $3,500,000,000 of
the preceding week. The failures for the week were 244, against 259
last year, and there were none serious enough to attract attention.
The best reports are being received from the iron and steel in
hongti the production has increased enormously during
the past year quotation* are maintained and the furnaces and mills
â  adilv booking new orders, sufficient to keep them running for
months yet without any new business. This excellent condition
of the leading manufacturing industry of the country is serv-
M a powerful credit tonic and is in itself sufficient to main
lie spirit of confidence which prevails throughout the whole
I to it the remarkable supply of all sorts of ready money
\ eminent and bank vaults and private hands, and we find the
bane conditions for all the expansion in business during the past
Nor must the fine crop prospects be overlooked in this con
>n.
During the past year or two a new commercial procedure seems
to have been developing in the United States â that mentioned in the
â¢ aragraph as the European way. We have not been chasing the
we did up to a year or two ago. We are as keenly alive to
the necessity for industry, activity and general enterprise as we ever
â  we arc less feverish and hysterical in our daily business
life. This ma\ prove a merely transitory or a permanent condition ;
C will tell. Hut it is certain that while we are doing more
real legitimate business than ever before, and steadily expanding
nerce in all directions, we are more deliberate and conserva
â¢ it than for many years. There is less speculation and
more Fashioned careful mercantile spirit of our fathers.
Stable condition to be in. We will amass as large
bat we will live longer and enjoy life better.
A survey of the field of general business fails to reveal any
disqtr g - gits at the moment. Labor is fully employed, and at
C g - tad waÂ£e-earners are not so ready to strike on the
smalk cation as they were up to a couple of years ago. The
vast financial interest";, too, after having their fingers burned a num
ber of time*, are more cautious about exploiting all sorts of new
enterprises, which, while presenting a glittering aspect from a dis
tance, prove hollow bubbles on closer acquaintance. The farmers
â ng so well for some years that they are now in most
excellent condition. The manufacturing plants of the country are
fully employed, and there is hardly any idle machinery in any line.
The banks all over the country report an abundance of ready funds,
and interest rates are consequently moderate. The merchants in all
sections are sending in reports of active trade, with collections aver
age and profit margins fair. Legislature*, national and State, think
twice before passing laws which frighten capital and embarrass trade.
In brief, the change from the conditions immediately following the
Spanish war i^ so marked that we may reasonably ask if the country
i<Â« really discarding its old feverish methods, known to foreigners
as "American hurry." and falling more and more into the quiet Euro
pean way of doing business.
In any event, we are all right at present from a financial and
commercial point of view. How long we shall continue SO rests
very largely with ourselves.
MERCHANT MARINE AND SOUTH AMERICA.
TH E recent rapid development of trade between Europe and
South America teaches this country a rare lesson upon the mer
chant marine question and shows plainly that if we expect com-
mercial relation> with the latter country we must create those re- !
lations. It is not enough that our great variety of surplus products '
finds a natural outlet along well beaten ocean paths. To properly
place them it is necessary to use energy in locating new markets.
It is not enough that foreign ships bring goods to be sold to us for
the profit of foreign countries and take away our surplus products.
"\\ c must reach out for ourselves if we expect to share in all of the
benefits.
Europe wants our trade and sends her subsidized ships to get
it. We have no ships, and accept them, the only means at hand.
South America, a country of enormous possibilities, but without
energy or initiative, is yielding up her trade to Europe in the same
passive way. That continent is on the alert, has recognized the im
mense value of the South American trade and is fast building it up.
There are English. German. Italian and French steamer lines to all
the principal ports, while we have practically nothing but a few inter
mittent tramp steamers in either ocean. To establish steady com
mercial intercourse our goods must go first to Europe with an added
expense and a lost of time, and thence to destination in subsidized
foreign bottoms. We give South America police protection by the
Monroe doctrine and in return see her trade given to others.
r steamship companies will not undertake experiments un
less encouraged to overcome the difference in conditions. They will
not take the initiative in so important a question without a guarantee
of support while building up sufficient traffic to maintain the line.
1 hey must at least partly overcome the original difference in the cost
of ships, in present wages and in the standard of living on our ships
as against foreign ships.
The natural productions of South America exceed those of any
other continent. We need her raw material and she needs our man
ufactures. We need her hides, nitrates, coffee, skins, rubber and
she needs our agricultural implements and the general
output of our mills, factories and foundries. The present annual
value of the agricultural products of the Argentine republic alone
H enormous, yet that country has hardly i per cent of her area under
cultivation. She has more than a score of steamship lines with Eu
rope, while her trade with us is merely nominal.
We cannot hope to establish trade with South America in for
ng from European ports. To get into that market
we must meet the European delivery price at destination. It must
be American goods in American ships. When we have that, char
acteristic American energy will take care of itself and a reciprocal
condition will be established between the two Americas whichwvill
bring them into better relations commercially, socially and politi- !
callv. i

MEN, WOMEN AND CHILDREN STRETCH THEIR
NECKS WHEN THIS GIANTESS MAKES HER
APPEARANCE ON THE STREETS OF COLOGNE
THERE has recently appeared in Cologne a woman
from the provinces who is remarkable in several
particulars. Her actual height is seven feet ZVz
inches, and according to the physicians she is still
. growing. She is 22 years old and described as very
beautiful. She has blue eyes, fair hair and is very good
tempered. She was born in 1882 in a village near Hel
singfors.\ Her parents and sisters are only of a normal
height, and nobody would have-expected that Rosa.Wed
sted, which is her name, would grow so tall. When 6
years old she was like the other children, quite normal,
and it was only from that date that she grew rapidly,
WHY DOES A WOMAN WORRY?
Woman is not only a spendthrift at
the bargain counter, but she is a
spendthrift of strength. She makes the
most ruinous overdrafts on her nerves,
vitality, and endurance. Few of us live
the port of lives that keep us youthful
and buoyant. It is either a matter <>f
extreme idleness or extreme activity.
There seems no medium, balance or
between condition, says a writer in the
New York Globe.

A blue-eyed girl was with her.
"I have came to see you about this

Baltimore, who told all the old doctors
that we're no pood at forty and ought
to be chloroformed off at sixty "

Meaning of "Â«p."
The word "tip" originated in the old
English coffee-house. At the door of
these coffee-houses was a box made
usually of brass, with lock and key.
It had engraved upon it the letters,
"T. I. P."âobserve the stops between
the letters â"To insure promptness."
Customers, as they passed rnjt, dropped
a coin in for the waiters. Hence the
word "tip."
THAT OLD SWEETHEART
OF YOURS.
If Fate Has Kept You Far Apart Shun Meeting
Him and Cherish Youthful Illusion.
DOROTHY FENIMORE
IF you wish to cherish as a romantic
figure that old sweetheart of yours,
whom you would have married had
some circumstance been other than
it actually was, you had better not
spoil your early impression of his over
powering personality by a less Matter
ing later view, if fate has been kind
to both of you, and kept you far apart.
Shun renewal of the old acquaint
ance, and store away your fancy pic
ture of Mm in the lavender of senti
mental memory, appreciating as an
added charm the golden luster it has
gained beneath the yellowish touch of
time. Otherwise you may lose some
thing that is dearer to you thanâ
possessing it potentially â you now
know, the last ecstatic flutter of which
your weather-beaten heart is capable â
and make your life poorer by a wealth
of sweet illusions gone.
For the years are so outrageously
hard on our old sweethearts. And it is
a harrowing experience to find that the
hero of our youth, who has been dom
inating our tender recollection as an
Adonis, has grown stout and bald
headed, and has a game leg* from the
gout. It is mortifying to find him
whom we have been saluting mentally
as a prince of conversationalists, as
witty as gallant, as appreciative as
sincere, nothing more or less than a
commonplace purveyor of cold-storage
compliments, which, to be edible, must
first be thawed out by the sunshine of
our smile.
But neither of these disappointments
can compare with that hollowness of
spirit which you endure when you
meet the woman whom your old sweet
heart married. Can it be that you are
like her in any wayâ that he should
have been attracted to you both? The
fact that she is as much too fat as
you are too thin is slippery consola
tion after your first flush of self-con
gratulation that you are not as some
other women of thirty are, but are still
lithe, svelte, and eighteen inches
round, for avoirdupois, more or less, is
not a test of personal magnetism. And
the fact that she is regarded by her
neighbors and the members of her
church as "the salt of the earth." does
not win your commendation, since you,
yourself, have never felt a hankering
THE DUKE SCORED.
An English nobleman was once
present at .a church service when a col
!ec tion was announced for some charit
able object.
The plate began to go round, and the
duke carefully put his hand into his
pocket and took out a florin, which he
laid on the edge of the pew-desk before
him ready to be transferred to the
plate.
Beside him sat a little snob, who,
noticing this action, Imitated It by
Â« stentatiously laying a sovereign along
side the ducal florin.
This was too much for his Grace,
v.ho dipped his hand into his pocket
again and pulled out another florin,
which he laid by the side of the first.
: The little snob followed suit by laying i
i another sovereign beside the first.
His Grace quickly added a third
fibrin, which was capped by a third
sovereign on the part of the little snob.
Out came a fourth florin to swell the
dukes donation, and then the little
snob triumphantly laid three sovereigns
at once upon the board.
The duke, not to be beaten, produced
three florins.
Just at that moment the plate ar
rived. The little snob took up his
handful of sovereigns, ostentatiously
rattled them into the plate, and then
turned defiantly toward his rival as if
he would say, "I think that takes the
shine out of you."
The duke, with a grim smile, put one
florin into the plate, and quietly swept
the remaining six back into his pocket.

BED BUGSâ Subscriber. Oakland.
Cal. Benzine or gasoline will kill bed
bugs as fast as they can be reached.
By using a spring bottom oiler the
fluid may be forced into cracks or
crevices more thoroughly than by any
other means. As these fluids are highly
inflammable, coatact with fire or flame
during the operation must be avoided.
Vapor escaping from an uncorked bot
tle of benzine will ignite m>m a flame
several feet away. After a room in
fected with the bugs has been treated
with either fluid it should be wÂ«l] aired
and ventilated until the gas passes
away. If the bugs are in bedsteads
such should be examined thoroughly
in March and April in order to de
stroy the eggs.

which is considered a great delicacy
by the Chinese at "dinners of state," is
used for the making of soups exclu

a. species of swallow, which builds in
caves and on damp rocks on the
Elands ,of the Indian Archipelago.
This bird macerates a kind of seaweed
in its crop and constructs the nest by
drawing this food forth again through
its mouth in gelatinous fibers, which
it attaches to the damp stone with it 3
bilL These nests are of the same shape
at those which the chimney swallows
build, and hold the eggs and young
of the bird against the lift in the same
manner. They are usually about three

preparing these nests for food involves
considerable - labor, for every particle
of dirt or feathers must be carefully
picked away and the whole washed
several times in cold water. When the
nests are perfectly free from Impurl

etc., into a soup. , The nest itself is
almost tasteless and greatly resembles

Investigation .Body Charges
'Dint a Fraudulent Traffic
Is Conducted in St. Louis
MEN OF UTAH REPORT;
Delegation Also Finds Gross
Irregularities in Finances
of the State Commission
SALK LAKE, Utah, March 12.â The
special committee recently sent to St.
Louis by the lower house of the Utah
Legislature to investigate irregularities
in the accounts of Utah's commission
to the Louisiana Purchase Exposition
has presented a report that is severe
in its criticism of the management of
the exposition. The report says:
We dre unanimous In reporting that, accord
ing to our knowledge and belief, the so-called
.iv. ards. consisting of medals, ribbons, etc.,
.^u]>. seffijr given as marks of merit by the St.
â¢fncial award and ribbon committee, by
authority of the Louisiana Purchase Exposi
tion to the so-called successful exhibitors, are,
in our opinion, an Immense and gigantic fraud.
The report charges that so-called
awards of merit are being issued "by
a straw incorporation" for the sole
purpose of being sold to be used in a
commercial way as advertising matter.
The committee reports the substance of
a conversation with an agent alleged
to be employed specially to sell these
awards on commission. The alleged
agent, the report says, exhibited one
award "of special merit" that he said
he had sold for $500 and stated to the
committee that a certain well known
manufacturing concern had paid as
high as $20,000 for a so-called official
award to be used for advertising pur
poses.
The committee further charges that
legitimate medals are being held back
by the exposition management to pro
mote this traffic In awards.
In its investigation of the Utah com
mission the committee verified various
charges of Irregularities, including
forgeries of vouchers aggregating $2108.
The Legislature will be asked to ap
propriate $7000 to cover the deficit In
the funds of the State commission.
Representatives S. J. Stooker, W. N.
Gundry and H. S. Joseph composed
the sub-committee which reported oni
I conditions at St. Louis.

i into the charges of brutality against ;
I two policemen who arrested the nine
I women for visiting a poolroom at 581

i not concluded till yesterday afternoon. :
He heard the statements of ';' Mrs. E. I

Alice Carr, Mrs. Josle Murphy and i
i Miss Helen Grant. -. \
j The women exonerated Policemen i
' Donald R. Campbell, W. T. Hooper
! and E. J. McNamara, but they blamed
, Policeman G. W. . Harrigan for using
undue violence. Mrs. Murphy com- j
plained that when she attempted to
run out of the room Harrigan pulled
her back so roughly that her face
struck the wall, bleeding her nose. â¢
They all admitted calling Harrigan
names, and Miss Grant said that he I
was excitable but not insulting till af
: ter he had received provocation. His
: language was not insulting, but it
was his manner. |
Acting Chief Spillane says he does i
not believe that Harrigan, in the cir- I
I cumstances, used unnecessary vio- \
lence, but he has not yet decided i
what to do.
It is likely that charges will be pre
ferred against Policeman McNamara
for not taking Mrs. E. Berlin of the
Rosalind Hotel to the prison. His
principal offense is in denying that
he knew anything about Mrs. Berlin '
when first questioned by Captain
Duke. Mrs. Berlin will be arrested on
a warrant this morning. |

CHANGES HIS DRINK
TO A FATAL POTION
Michael Swift Consumes Carbolic
Acid After He Imbibes Freely
In Saloon.
Michael Swift, a laborer, about 40
years of age, committed suicide by ,
drinking carbolic acid in a saloon at !
Thirteenth and Bernice streets last
evening. He had been drinking heav
ily and probably was despondent.
Swift. with his brother-in-law,
Charles Kloss of 24 Norfolk street
and a man named W. Porter, had
spent a couple of hours in the place,
which is conducted by a Mrs. Herllhy.
Several drinks were served and, ac
cording to all accounts, there was no
quarreling. Finally Smith passed out
to the sidewalk and his companions
awaited his return for some time.
Just as they were about to start in
search of the missing man an empty
carbolic acid bottle was tossed inside
and SToans came from the street.
Kloss and Porter went outside to
investigate and found Smith writhing
in pain on the sidewalk. In answer
to his brother-in-law's question he
said he had drank the acid and wished
to die. The ambulance was called as
quickly as possible, but the poisoned
man died before he reached the Cen
tral Emergency Hospital. His body
was removed to the Morgrue.

SAVE THE SPANISH
NAMES IN THE STATE
Legislature Passes Resolution
ReGommenfliir Movement.
CLUBS INTERESTED IN NOMENCLATURE
LAURA BRIDE POWERS
A movement in which every patriotic
Californian should show a vital Inter
est is that originating with Zaeth S.
Eildridge, providing that all original
geographical Spanish names In Califor
nia be perpetuated, and in their uncor
rupted form.
The resolutions as before the Legis
lature may have little force as a co
eisive measure, but it certainly has
force as an educative measure.
To all people of a harmonious and a
cultivated mind, euphony is an essen
tial element. They love the vowels of
the L-utm tongue, because they roll
luxuriously from the lips, and are sug
gestive of ease, warmth and comfort.
And since, by a disposition of Provi
dence, this sunny country of ours
originally fell Into the hands of the
Spanish, and by them fitted with musi
cal and appropriate names, it is our
business to KEEP them.
They are bound .to these valleys,
rivers, bays and the cities and towns
in and around them by ties of euphony,
romance and history, and they essen
tially belong to California as a part of
her glamourous personality.
Likewise does It recall her pic
turesque past, and in the days to come,
when the descendants of the early
Spaniards will have passed away, then
will the names call up the picturesque
days of the pastoral era, when peace
and plenty ruled the land, and calm I
content was king.
That there is an eternal fitness of
Spanish names to California, with her
turquoise skies, her sunlit days, her
silver nights, is apparent to any who
can feel intangible things.
In truth was California, the land of
Califria, the beautiful queen of the
Amazons, lineal daughter of Spain.
And thus must we rally to the saving
of her names, for In them are writ her
history.
For the splendid work in behalf of
this matter the clubwomen who are in
terested â and I am yet to find those
who are not â are deeply indebted to
Mr. Eldridge. So should all Cali
fornians tender their support, before
the Easterners, who know nothing of
our picturesque history, pervert or de
stroy our native names.
They are a part of us, even as is our
climate, as are our hills, our valleys,
our mesas, and we cannot lose them,
else we lose part of our personality.
The fate of the bill attempting to aid
in the matter is of vast interest to all
the clubs in the State.
But whatever happens to the bill, the
education "still goes marching on."

The Cap and Bells will make
merry Thursday evening, March 28,
when a variety of Interesting and sur

That something's going to happen is
evident from the lot of rehearsing

upon it that the stunts will be worth
while. The Cap and Bells never does

And by the way, the men are in

The triennial conclave of Mothers'
Clubs Is now in session at Washing
ton, discussing problems that relate to
children, the marriage relation and
public morals â and incidentally warm
ing over the hash of the Smoot matter.
Isn't it about time they hunted up
something more modern to grow hys
terical over? That Smoot question has
long ago passed the debatable stage,
but the dear ladies don't seem to know
It.
What they did do that was worth
while was their declaration for uni
form divorce laws in the United States
and the discussion of laws for the
protection of children.
The fact that this convention is
really composed of mothers gives it
some additional weight, since it's
usually maiden ladies who know best
how to manage husbands and children.
And by the way, why is it that we
have never had a Congress of Fathers?
They might throw some light upon the
unsolved domestic problems.

On Monday afternoon, February 27,
the Outdoor Art League held a sym
posium, given to Individual expressions
of ideal art, as* exempliflpd by what the
members regarded as the most beauti
ful sights viewed in this country and
foreign lands. The cathedral of Milan
was graphically described, also the in
terior courtyards of Spain and Italy.
Golden Gate Park was highly praised
as being one of the most beautiful
spots in the world.
The ladies of the league have been
much gratified by the recent action of
the Supervisors approving their plan
for four small parks in the center of
Dolores street, between Fifteenth and
Seventeenth, also for the construction
of grass plots along the outer edge of i
the sidewalks on both sides of the '
street between the streets named, and
arrangements for the care of same.

programme was a fascinating lecture
on Venice by Henry Payot. The beau

by the scenes on canvas. The pro
gramme concluded with two well ren

The next meeting of the California
Club is to be "bird day," on March 21.
A lecture on "Bird Protection" will be
given by Georgre Wharton James of
Pasadena, who is well known as a wri

of great merit.
The State Federation of Clubs in Los
Angeles in February discussed the Au
dubon movement and passed a resolu
tion indorsing the bird day bill which
the California Club had sent to the !
Legislature. This bill relates to an an
nual school bird day.
The federation also recommends that
all the clubs have an annual bird day.
The California Club had one such day
in December and the one on March 21
will be its second. For the second time
an invitation is extended to the teach
ers of the public schools to be the
guests of the club on that afternoon.
The Browning Club is doing some

Her first letter:
' Dear Mrs. Pinkham :â: â
" I have been a sufferer for the past eight
years with a trouble which first originated
from painful menstruation â the pains were
excruciating, with inflammation and ulcera-
1 tion of the womb. The doctor says I must
have an operation or I cannot live. Ido not
! want to submit to an operation if I can possi-
bly avoid it. Please help me."â Mrs. Mary
Dunmick, Washington, D. C
Her second letter ;
Dear Mrs. Pinkham :â
"You will remember my condition when I
1 last wrote you, and that the doctor said I
must have on operation or I could not live.
: I received your kind letter and followed your
; advice very carefully and am now entirely
I well. As my case was so serious it seems a
miracle that lam cured. I know that I owe
not only my health but my life to Lydia E.
, Pinkham's Vegetable Compound and to your
advice. I can walk miles without an ache or
' a pain, and I wish every suffering woman
would read this letter and realize what you

i PLOT IN PHILADELPHIA
j - TO OVERTHROW CASTRO
>
1 Complaint Said to Have Been Made
to the President by Venezuelan
' Consnl.
PHILADELPHIA, March 12.â The
Record to-morrow will say: A formid
able insurrectionary movement against
the Costro regime in Venezuela has
been uncovered in this city by agents
of the Venezuelan Government, and so
alarming is the nature and strength of
the revolutionary "plot that a formal
protest has been sent to President
Roosevelt by F. Salecedo Ochoa. the
Venezuelan Consul here. Senor Ochoa's
complaint is based on the discoveries
of Venezuelan secret police, who have
been keeping a sharp watch on revolu
tionists now living in this city.
The machinations against Castro,
according to evidence discovered by
the detectives, have reached a climax
and unless the plot is overthrown a
steamship, under surveillance, will
shortly leave this port on a secret mis
sion, which is said to be no less than
an armed move against the South
American President and his Govern
ment.

LOS ANGELES, March 12. â Late

TUBERCULOSIS HOSPITAI.
BILL WILL BE VETOED
Governor Opposes Measure Because j
the State Cannot Afford the
Cost of Institution.
PACRAMENTO, March 12. â Gov- j
ernor Pardee says he will veto the bill j
for the tuberculosis hospital. He said:
I resret Ihet I am unable to sign this bill, j
We ought to have the hospital but can't afford !
it. 1 believe that if we go at it right in fifty j
years we shall be able to stamp out tuber- |
I'Ulusis and there would be no such thing as
that malady In our country. That's one rea
son I am so sorry the hospital must be sacri
ficed, but it cannot be helped.
In a letter to the advocates of the
new hospital. Governor Pardee said:
rii.Te is something to be Bald at the present
time with regard to appropriations: The Leg
islature has been very good to me this time
for It has sent to me only about $1,000,000
In spocial appropriations more than 'the
finances of the State win permit me to sign. ,
And as these appropriations are mostly for '
th. btnelit of institutions already In existence,
you will see tHat if we did justice to our
present institutions it would be necessary to
sign for $1,000,000 more than we could afford
before anything could be done tor new In- I
ati tut ions. I

blew throughout the game, causing the
baJl to go out of the field several times.
In the first half the Rovers scored
three . goals and in the second period
added four more, two of them being
from penalty kicks. During the inter
val between ' the two periods of play
the Eagles complained that the ball
with which they were playing was too
light and lodged a protest on this
ground with the referee. Later, how
ever, they decided to continue playing
with the same ball. The game was
somewhat rough and' fouls were fre
quent. In the second period Bennett of

OUTDOOR LIFE
TO BE SHOW
Â»
Wide flange Which Coming
. Forest, Fish and Game
Exhibition Will Assume
The opening night of the Forest.
Fish and rjame Association Exhibi
tion on the 31st inst. will be a gala
nffair. It is the Intention to make it
a complimentary social evening and
reception night, for which no tickets
\\i\\ be sold. Directors, stockholders
and shareholders will have the distri
bution of tickets in hand, and a spe
cial invitation will be extended to such
of the smart set as are interested in
the movement for which the associa
tion is sponsor â to bring out the
touch of nature that makes the whole
world kin. Just as the evergreen
mountains and valleys of California
are breaking out in their greatest
beauty, many of the stately trees and
dwarfed shrubs will be brought into
Mechanics' Pavilion. Pine needles
will litter the floor; country lanes
will be reproduced; patches of rus
tic fences will carry out the general
effect: the odor of wlldflowers will
fill the air.
Scattered through this profusion of
nature's endowments will be found
exhibits of a sort that will be educa
tional without being dull. Charity is
to benefit by the labor of a band of
energetic nature enthusiasts, and the
whole community must reap a harvest
of moral and mental instruction. Simi
lar affair* have been a great success
in Rfistern cities under the guise o f
sportsmen's shows. The same idea
will be carried out here with a greater
dash of the nature element because
the natural advantages are so close at
hand and so easy of access.
Although the setting will be so elab
ornte and the whole effect so entran
cing, the association has not lost
track of the fact that the entertain
ment must also be diverting. A band
of thirty-five pieces under the lead
ership of Dr. Stewart and Theodore
Vogt will render appropriate concerts
both afternoon and evening during the
two weeks the exhibition will run.
An art gallery of generous propor
tions will contain the best work of
California artists on subjects only per
taining to the general scheme. It will
be a feature in itself. On the ath
letic field will be constant amuse
ment of a diversified character. In a
portion of the gallery will be the only
departure from the idea of outdoor
life, and even that will conform as
nearly as possible with the plan â a
society midway without the features
that have brought odium on the word.
Under the guidance of Albert Van der
Xaillen Jr. this little highway should
be attractive. In a word, the able
management is doing everything
within its -power to create interest and
provide an exhibition that will be
come permanent and will be looked
forward to from season to season as
it is in the Eastern cities.
Noted Distance Runner Coming.
Alfred Shrubb, the famous long
distance runner, who won the one
mile championship of England, Wales,
Scotland and France last year and who
holds several world's records, will
visit this country this year. He is in
Australia and will reach this city about
midsummer. Shrubb'e time for two
miles Is 8:08 1-5.
Score Ten Goals
to Four for the
Home Men.
The pololats sporting the colors of the
liurlingham club of England defeated
a four from the Burlingrame Country
('liib by a score of 10 goals to 4 yes
lerday In hollow fashion on the pri
vate field of Francis J. Carolan. The
English visitors played better polo
than at any time during their visit
while the Burlingame men seemed un
able to work up to their usual stand
ard of play at any stage of the con
test.
The game brought out strongly the
value of team play. The Englishmen
worked with the precision of a ma
chine, passing the ball along from man
to man and with everyone in his
place. Three of the Burlingame men
ar. j accustomed to playing the posi
tion of back. This was soon appar
ent, as they did not engage the men
playing opposite them with the re
quired skill.
Both teams were exceptionally well
mounted, their ponies playing the
game w.e)l and showing a lot of speed
and quality. Mr. Mackey, who de
serves all the credit for bringing over
the English team, rode three ponies
which flitted about the fields like
gray ghosts. Their sire, Grandee, a
thorough hred, which was famous on
the track some years ago as a mud
runner, transmitted speed and game
neps to them. Their gray color is
against them and they would never
win a medal in a beauty show. They
were bred by Captain MeKittriek of
Bakersfleld and were thoroughly
broken for polo by Dr. Boeseke, a
pony enthusiast of Santa Barbara.
The outcome of the game could be
readily forecast after the first period,
in which Menzies made three goals.
The visitors followed up this advan
tage in the second period, Prescott
scoring one goal and Mackey two.
De Crespigny added another goal in
the third. McCreery broke the ice
for the Burlingame men in this period
by scoring their first goal.
In the fourth period Walter Hobart
scored two goals. These were quickly
offset, as both Prescott and Mackey
scored. The score board read 9 to 3
at the end of the period. Mackey
made the last goal for the visitors in
the fifth period. Walter Hobart
placed the ball between the posts in
the last period. When the umpire's
whistle sounded the score was 10 to 4.
Captain de Crespigny and Sir
George Prescott are members of the
Horse Guards Blue, the crack Eng
lish household cavalry regiment.
While they played a brilliant game
their work proved no more effective
than that of Mackey and Menzies.
who seldom missed a stroke at the
ball.
As the players rode off the field
Walter Hobart called for three cheers
for the visitors. These were given
and then Captain de Crespigny called
for cheers for the Burlingames.
Despite the rain of the early morn
ing the field was both safe and fast
and a large gallery turned out to wit
ness the game. The teams lined up:

VIGILANCE FOILS PLANS
OF OREGON WRECKERS
Several Attempts Are Made to Bring
About Disaster to Trains and
Street Cars.
PORTLAND, Or., March 12.â News
of a series of attempts to wreck trains
and electric cars near Oregon City was
telephoned from that place to-night.
It was reported the attempt to derail
a Southern Pacific freight train had
been in a measure successful, the
tender leaving the track. No one was
injured. The freight, which was an
extra following the southbound pas
senger train for Southern Oregon and
California points, was approaching
Oregon City when it is reported to
have struck an obstruction.
About the same time, and almost
opposite the spot where the attempt
to wreck the freight train occurred, the
motorman on an Oregon water electric
line, which parallels the Southern Pa
cific tracks, discovered an obstruction
en the track and bringing his car to
a sudden stop averted what might have
been a serious disaster. An examina
tion disclosed two heavy timbers across
the track. A short distance further on
another obstruction, consisting of three
timbers, was removed from the tracks
and still further on a third obstruction
was encountered and removed.

Too Much Wind For Model Yachts.
The Dickie cup race which was
scheduled for last Sunday was again
postponed yesterday. A week ago the
wind was too light to permit of the
race being held and yesterday the wind
was too strong. A few of the model
yachts were sailed, but the strong wind
made it almost impossible to keep them
right side up. The following boats
were out on the lake: William Roeck
ner's Alliance, Brown's Surprise, J.
Brannan's Alice, G. W. Hays 1 Amelia
and Cookson'a new sloop Corinthian. i
CRACK DISTANCE HORSES
IN THE THORNTON STAKE
ORCHAN A LIKELY STARTER
Daly and Jennings
Still Leading in
Money Won.
An event which annually attracts
much attention will be decided at the
Oakland track next Saturday. It is
the Thornton stakes at four miles, and
doubtless one of the largest crowds
of the season will be in attendance.
Races of the kind are rare in this
country, there being only two each
year.
It is expected there will be six or
I seven starters on "Saturday and the
field will be the best that has com
peted for some years. Among the
prominent elieibles is Horatlus, win-
I ncr of the Waterhouse cup at two
miles and a quarter. Orchan, which
took the Ascot cup at Los Angeles on
Saturday, is also entered. Other can
, didates are Flying Torpedo, Nitrate,
1 Stilicho, Veterano. Colonel Anderson
1 and Barrack. These horses show to
â  advantage over a distance of ground
and a good contest should result.
The New California Jockey Club
adds $-jrÂ»oo and the stake will have a
value of more than $3000. â¢
The programme for Saturday pro
vides that all the races shall be at
a mile or over.
The main attraction on Wednesday
will be a $1000 handicap at a mile for
three-year-olds and upward.
Walter Jennings may soon take the
lead from M. J. Daly in the matter of
winnings. He is a close second. The
New California Jockey Club has dis
tributed about $292.00*) in stakes and
purses and many owners have shared
this =urn. Those winning more than
$2000 are:

A preacher calling himself Rev. D. E.
Kaywood \va? taken from the Bu'pit of
the Free Methodist Church her*; this
â¢ vet, ing. escorted to the river by fifty
men and there treated tn a coat of tar
and feathers, after which he was told
to b aye town f. >r K'>"<l.
It is said that Kaywood was formerly
a "Holy Roller." and was once a den
ti?t in Portland. Several women who
have been attending his meetings in the
church are on the verge of insanity
through his wild exhortations, threats
and denunciations. Before the services
closed this evening ten yc.-ung men,
masked, entered the church and seized
Kaywood. Outside were forty more
men. He was given no opportunity to
explain matters and was ducked in the
river aft^r the tar and feathers had
been applied.
BEKGKII DEVKLOPS SPEED
WITH THE BOXING GLOVES
Cuts Out the Severe Work on the
Rood. Which Most Fighters
, Think Necessary.
Coast champion Sam Berger and
Middle West Champion Bill Rickards
will settle a dispute as to which is the
best heavy-weight boxer before the
San Francisco Athletic Club at Wood
ward's Pavilion o-n Wednesday even
ing. Rickards, who hails from Chi
cago, on account of his sise, strength
and skill, has made those who were of
the opinion that Berger was the best
of. all the heavies sit up and take no
tice.
Even a bad judge of fighters would
be quick to notice that the 210-pound
Chicagoan has a style far above the
average heavy-weight. He handles his
immense bulk with a skill born of long
experience. He is well educated and
a good conversationist, though never
bcastful. His trainer. Dick Green, is
so confident of Rickards ability to
beat Berger that he is risking the
chance of traveling fourth-class back
to Chicago, which means walking the
ties.
Berger will be in rare condition
when the two enter the ring and will
be faster and more confident than ever
before. He has been training along
lines that tend to develop speed, de
voting most of his time to sparring,
having eliminated the heavy road
work.

RISE IN LEVEL
OF THE LAKES.
Xo Explanation Offered M
Remarkable Phenomenon
Presented by Great Bodies
Special Dispatch to ThÂ« Call.
CHICAGO. March 12.â Shipowners
are puszled over the phenomenal rise
in the levels of the great lakes In the
last ten years, and are at a loss to ex
plain it. Every foot of added draft for .
their ships means the addition of thou
sands of dollars to their freight earn
ing capacity, and as a natural result,
they are pleased. So far as known no
theory yet has been advanced by men
of science which explains the increased
volume of water in the lakes.
The following table shows tbÂ« rise
in the lake levels during the last ten
years, the figures being the number
of feet above mean sea level:
, 1803. 1904
Lake Superior Â«08 1-1* 604 1-4
Lain Huron and Michigan... 580 1-1Â« SSI 2-3
Lake Erie 5711-2 573 1-4
Lake Ontario 245 248 ;
In each case the comparison is taken â ,'
at high water mark for the year.

Ing and rendered many beautiful
hymns in such excellent manner as to

At the close of the service the mem
bers of the congregation expressed
hope that Mr. Hough would have
the services of the bright boys at no

the congregation on behalf of the boys
for its appreciation and extended to all

TFAMSTKK TAKES A FATAL
DRINK OF CARBOLIC ACID
Brother of .Joseph Cooney Says HLÂ«
JVath Was Due to Accident and
Not Design.
Joseph roomy. I teamster, who
lived at 208 Folsom street, died from
taking a draft of carbolic acid yester
day morning. He was a single man,
35 years of age. and lived ' with his
parents. Whether his death was ac
< identa! or intentional is a "matter of
conjecture.
"Walter Tooney. a brother of the
dead man, told Deputy Coroner Fen
nell that Joseph had been subject to
fits and violent pains in his head ever
since he fell off the City Hall about
two ye^rs ago. He was in the habit
of drinking diluted carbolic acid and
whisky to relieve the pain in his head.
Yesterday morning Joseph ate his
breakfast and seemed to be in good
.spirits:. Then he complained of the
pain in his head, and Walter supposes
he swallowed too big a dose of the di
luted carbolic acid. His mother
bought the acid about four days ago.
The body was removed to the Morgue.

SAY CLARK HAS
CORRECT IDEA
Sau Francisco Artists Are
Relighted to Hear About
NV\\ Director's Schemes
Local artists are enthusiastic over '
the remarks made by-Sir Carpar Clark
I in London Saturday. : His t scheme" ; to *.'
I encourage American art through his
I position of director of the Metropolitan
Museum of Art in New York is hailed
1 with the greatest satisfaction. San
Francisco's painters have > unlimited
I confidence in the development of their
I art; in this country and feel that the
j time is near when the ,'canvasers of â¢
j native Americans shall equal and out
shine the' more matured works' of the
'..! Old World. 'Amandee JoulUn said.yes-
, terday : i
i I think Sir Caspar Clark comes pretty near
'to the truth. Too many Americans buy th<-!r
pictures' abroad because the European trade
. mark has an v attraction for them. .There: are .â¢
I some Americans, -however, who know how to
; appreciate paintings without 1 : respect to the
nation from which they come and who will pay
â¢prices " commensurate with, the, character of
thÂ» !, work. ' â¢ -; . ' ; *
1: We must remember that the country is young:
yet and that perhaps art has not, had" the op
1 portunity to grow proportionately with other,
I thinss. I believe that the artist should always
depict his own country. â * We Americans should
! paint American history,' American landscapes .
I and American marines. ' Ther? Is here as much :
wealth in crt subjects as in anything else. '
:â '; There is not sufficient -discrimination . exer
â¢ciscd in the purchase of pictures. ! I know of
J collections 'â â  â ' â¢- city that ire mainly copies. I

Francis .' McComas said: ;
-, 1 am delighted to learn that new blood is to'
I 1, . ; introduced into American art. by securing
' Sir Caspar. Clark's services; as director- of the

G. Cadenasso said:
I \vi?h Sir Caspar Clark the best of luck in
h'c right to uplift Amefican art. I do not
agree that It Is absolutely necessary for an
artist to have a European stamp on his work
t'i have It properly appreciated in this country.
There are many people In the United States
who have ths finest artistic taste. The trouble
lies, I think, with the artists themselves.
They ko to Europe, paint European scenes and
the majority of the public, relying on the
tastes of the painters, wants Europe In the
work. I know that many people, when they .
learn that an artist has not painted abroad,
think that his â  work must be Inferior. It is
not necessarily so. TVe have a wealth of ma
terial here and thÂ° genius to go with it.
Dan Leno, the comedian, left his es
tate to his widow and six children. His
property included shares in three the

life insurance policy for $50,000.

BOY FOOTPADS
ARE CAPTURED
Joseph Jackson Assaulted
and Robbed on Stevenson
Street in Regular Style
CALLS LOUDLY FOR HELP
Youthful Thugs Run Into a
Lodging - House Where
They Are Found by Officers
William Bray, 18 years of age, and
Leslie Quinn, 17, were arrested for
robbing early yesterday morning by
Policemen Nolan and Cameron. Quinn
gives his occupation as a messenger
boy, and Bray says he is a teamster.
Joseph Jackson, an electrician, living
at 31 2 A Clementina street, was their
victim. He was on Stevenson street
between Third and Fourth when the
two youths approached him. Bray
struck him on the face and held him
while Quinn went through his pockets,
taking $4 in silver. Bray told Jackson
if he made an outcry he would shoot
him, but no weapon was displayed.
As soon as they disappeared Jackson
shouted for help and his cries were
heard by Nolan and Cameron. They
hurried to the scene and Jackson told
them that the youths who had robbed
him had run into 255 Stevenson street.
The police searched the house and
found Bray and Quinn in a room occu
pied by Mr. and Mrs. J. S. Arnold.
They were arrested and Jackson at
once identified them. When searched
Jt.2o was found in Quinn's pockets and
it was booked as evidence against
them.
The police think that Bray and Quinn
were two of the three youths who held
up Jacob Bryer, a brewer, at Fourth
and Mission streets, late Saturday
night and after beating him into un
consciousness robbed him of $1. As
soon as Bryer is well enough to visit
the prison he will be asked to take a
look at Bray and Quinn to see whether
he can identify them.

DECLARES WINE
WAS HARMLESS
Mrs. .T. Marshall Asserts She
Felt No Evil Effects
From Drinking Sherry
Though Mrs. Juana Marshall, the
aged Mexican woman who was alleged
to have been poisoned last December
from drinking sherry, denies that she
suffered any ill effects from the stuff,
the police have sent the bottle of. wine
to the City Chemist.
According to Mrs. Leonie Lucich. the
nurse who had been attending Mrs.
Marshall until January 9, the wine was
left at the door of the old woman's
home, 1112 Powell street, by Robert
Donahue, a relative of Mrs. Marshall's
deceased husband. Mrs. Lucich says
the took the sherry to the old woman,
who'drank some of it and immediately
afterward became ill.
Mrs. Marshall drank from the bottle
on the next day, and again became ill.
Mrs. Lucich became suspicious, and
when she left Mrs. Marshall's employ
on January 9 she took the bottle with
her. Last Thursday she took the stuff
to Dr. D. Trevino. The physician
forced some of it into the mouth of a
kitten, which in seventeen minutes died
frothing at the mouth.
The physician believes that the
symptoms were those of corrosive
sublimate poisoning. The bottle had
been in Mrs. Lucich's possession, ac
cording to the nurse, since January 9.
On Saturday she gave a bottle of
wine to Detective Bailey, saying that
it was the one that made Mrs. Mar
shall ill. The wine was analyzed, but
no traces of poison were found in it.
Yesterday Mrs. Lutich handed over to
Detective Bell another bottle. The first
bottle she declared ' was not the one
that contained the poison. The second
bottle is now in tht hands of the City
Chemist.
The tale of the alleged poisoning
came to light through a squabble over
the management of Mrs. Marshall's es
tate. The old woman owns prop^rty
v.orth about $30,000. which was left her
by her husband, Joseph Marshall, a
former restaurateur. James McMur
ray was administrator of the estate
until January 30. Then Juan Azarve. a
barber, obtained from the old woman a
power of attorney.
Rirhard Marshall, a nephew of Mrs.
Marshall, and Robert Donahue hay
filed suit to have the power of attorney
dissolved, and to have a guardian ap
pointed. The case comes up in Judge
Kerrigan's court to-day.
Mrs. Marshall said yesterday: "I was
not made sick by the wine. I don't
think that Donahue would try to poison
me. My husband told me to take care
of him. He has been living with me
for eight years. I don't think he would
try to harm me."
When Azarve heard of the filing of
the suit he delivered up to Mrs. Mar
shall the key to her compartment in
the safe deposit vault. The amount
deposited there cannot be ascertained
until Mrs. Marshall can go to the p!ai'Â»
herself or a legal guardian is appointed.
Richard Marshall and Donahue allege
that Azarve has been imposing on th*Â»
old woman. Donahue declares that he
is afraid the Azarve faction will mur
der him.
