PHYSICIANS
SAY HANNA
MUST REST
Doom the Patient to
â¢ Months of In
activity.
Dangerous Crisis in His
Illness Has Hot Yet
Been Passed.
Senator Is Completely Worn Out and
Must Go Into Retirement Should
He Recover.
f peciaJ Dispatch to The Call
CALL HEADQUARTERS. HOTEL
BARTON. WASHINGTON. Feb. 4.â
Senator Hanna is In a precarious con
dition. It was clear to-night that the
crisis in * his illness had not been
reached ard the best that could be
held out to his friends was that, Bhould
he recover, he would be compelled to
abstain from business and other ac
tivity for months. It was feared this
morning: that Senator Hanna was going
to develop symptoms of Bright's dis
ease or, that his heart weakness might
add to the complications of his Illness.
It was also c thought possible that he
had malaria. o
When cDr. Brewer arrived from
New York this morning a consultation
was held by him with Dr. Rixey and
Dr. Magruder of this city. The con
euitation lasted during most of the
forenoon. The result of it was that the
doctors were considerably puzzled.
Hanna had all the symptoms of suf
fering from a long attack of the grip
and exhaustion. A thorough physical
examination was made. It revealed
that while most of, o the "organs were
â without Any pronounced disease, all
were more or less affected.
COMPLICATION'* OF AILMENTS.
Senator Hanna's heart action was
found to be bad;' his kidneys were not
working well; Tiis liver was in very bad
condition; his Etomach was not work
ing at all, and would not even assimi
late i&llk; his lungs were slightly af
â¢fected and there were otfcer ail
ments which tended to complicate the
case, in addition to loss of strength and
nervous energy.
The doctors issued a bulletin in which
they announced tJbat Senator Hanna
â wae suffering from a recurrence of the
grip and with an unusual amount of
depreesion, but tha.t there were no
alarming symptoms and no reason to
believe that recovery would not take
place in reasonable time. This rather
negative bulletin failed to inspire con
fidence when It became known that
camples of Senator Hanna's blood had
been obtained for bacteriological ex
amination and that other examinations
were to be made.
OPIATES TO IXDCCE REST.
There was no change in Senator
Hanna's condition this afternoon. He
rested under opiates. The Senator's
condition led his friends to believe that
typhoid fever was developing. Dr.
Rixey would not express any opinion
on the case.
The Senator's family will feel much
relieved if the Eymptoms which he has
now should develop Into typhoid fever
andynothing worse. Last night they
were^ much alarmed lest his illness
might be absolutely helpless. While
his system is run down, the Senator's
temperament is such that they believe
he could combat an attack of typhoid
fever.
The doctors do not appear to tak'e
sanguine views. They regard Senator
Hanna as a man who is completely
worn out, in addition to being ill. His
whole constitution . is near collapse.
They Bay that if the crisis can be
averted the Senator will be lucky and
that his restoration to complete health,
will be a matter of months, which will
require complete avoidance of work
of all kinds.

WRECKING
TRAINS IS
HIS MANIA
Utah Lad an Accom
plice of Vengeful
Tramps.
Special Dispatch to The Call,
SALT LAKE, Feb. 4.â Three persons
accused of having attempted to wreck
an east-bound passenger train on the
Oregon Short Line eight miles north of
Bliss, Idaho, on Monday night have
been captured and are declared by the
secret service agents of the railroad to
be the guilty ones. One of the trio is a
lad of 16 years, a Salt Lake boy, who
has a mania for wrecking trains. That
he has not before this been -the cause
of a raijroad horror is not his fault.
The two men are tramps, it is said, who
were put off a train and in revenge at
tempted to cause wholesale loss of life.
.The men are in jail at Bliss. Superin
tendent Mason of the Idaho division
has sworn to complaints against the
three. The names of the tramps could
not be ascertained here to-night.
The arrest of the trio of would-be
train wreckers was the result of 'quick
and clever work on the part of the
railroad detectives. As soon as word of
the outrage was telegraphed Special
Agent Jones of the Short Line went
to the scene and began an investiga
tion, assisted by two other company
detectives and local officers at Bliss.
From persons living in the vicinity of
the attempted wreck good descriptions
of two men and a boy that had been
seen in the vicinity were obtained, and
within a few hours all three were in
custody.
The boy is Gus Nelson. His father
is dead, but he has a brother who re
sides here. The lad has been working
in Idaho, and it is charged that he has
developed a strong mania for wrecking
trains. He is accused of having several
times lately placed obstructions upon
the track of the Short Line and of hav
ing turned switches in an endeavor to
gratify his insane desire to see a
smash-up.

Special C^blc to The Call and New York Herald. Copyright, 1904, by the New York Herald Publishing Company.
ST. PETERSBURG, Feb. 4.â To-day is reckoned as the eve of the end. To-night Russia's answer
started to .Admiral Alexieff, to be handed by him to Baron de Rosen for presentation . to Baron Komura.
From now on the question of war or peace lies in the hands of the Mikado's Government.
This critical moment is one of defiance. One paper here represents the public mind in a sinister para
graph, quoting a Vladivostok telegram, which is emphasized, by being printed in the official Pravitelstvini
Viestnik, to the effect that the Russian fleet at Vladivostok has been painted black, which conveys realistically
the idea that, all her ships are ready for immediate action.
Russia" to-day is like a big bear, aroused with difficulty from his winter sleep and very angry at having
been prodded into action. The bear/is feeling mighty like -fighting and fully realizes now that, as an august
personage stated, "there is a limit to patience." . ,, y
Among the items of the day of exciting interest was the statement that if war broke out nearly a half
million Russian troops would be found spread about Vladivostok^ Port Arthur, Dalny and Nikolsk. Another
from Vladivostok stated that the Japanese mobilization was disappointingly slow; that the commercial classes
were clamoring for war in the face of an absolute stagnation of trade. Another told of anonymous circulars in
Shanghai calling upon merchants, inthe name of patriotism, not to" supply Russian ships with victuals. Another
reported the flight of Japanese merchants from Vladivostok.
There was a violent anti-American article in the Novoe Vremya, following upon one of the same tenor
yesterday. The Novoe Vremya publishes a long editorial article on its Port Arthur correspondence of yes
terday. The views of this correspondent may appear fantastic, the paper says, but nevertheless America is the
real foe screened behind Japan. The British, the paper continues, have assumed the act of betraying Europe
by truckling to the United States, and speeches at the recent banquet of. the Pilgrims' Society are cited as ex
amples of British servility. In conclusion the Novoe Vremya says: :
"When Great Britain has quite gone over to the United States the rest of Europe will realize the" ur
gency"of united action against America."
The Bourse pulled through the day upon buying from Berlin, whence a telegram was received saying
that optimism had returned there upon a report of the possibility of war being postponed till April." In official
circles it is hoped that the display of readiness for war shown by Russia will have the effect of cooling the
ardor of those of the Japanese who treasure the hope. that they had caught Russia napping.
In this, coupled with the diplomatic yet firm tone of. the reply, lies all the most serious hopes of peace.

AT AN END
Warring Interests
Compromise Dif
ferences.
NEW YORK, Feb. 4.â After frequent
conferences, the long fight between the
Sheldon reorganizing committee in the
United States Shipbuilding Company,
and the bondholders* protective com
mittee, represented by Samuel Unter
meyer, was settled to-night by the
formulation of a new plan, which has
been agreed to by both sides, and the
litigation in which Charles M. Schwab
has been the central figure will end.
Max Pam has been removed from the
reorganization committee and Pliny
Fisk, the banker, whose house will
take part of the work of financing the
new company, takes his place. Max
Nathan of the International Pump
Company has been agreed on as an
additional member of the committee to
represent the protective committee.
The new plan made public by "Wil
liam Nelson Cromwell is put out as
coming from Receiver Smith and pro
vides for a new company with a capi
talization of $30,000,000, ,half preferred
and half common. Schwab, as owner
of the Bethlehem bonds, will get $9,000,i
000 of preferred and J6.000.000 of com
mon stocky and the first mortgage
bondholders get the remainder, pro
rata. Schwab gives up his prior lien
on Bethlehem and all the present
stock is wiped out. The preferred
stock is to be 7 per cent non-cumula
tive.
There are to be issued $3,000,000 of col
lateral trust sinking fund 6 per cent
ten-year gold bonds, which are to be
taken up by a syndicate of which the
Morton Trust Company and Thomas F.
Ryan are to be managers and Harvey
Fisk & SOns participants, the latter to
market the bonds. These bonds are to
be Bold to the syndicate at $S75 per
510C0.
Former Secretary of "War Root Is
counsel for the syndicate managers.
The new organization committee will
consist of George R. Sheldon, chair
man; Charles S. Falrchild, John E.
Borne, Pliny Fisk, Charles "W. Wet
more and Max Nathan. â¢ -Â«?â¢- â .;;
Other terms of the compromise, to
which both sides gave up many things
which they had fought for up to the
last moment, include a provision that
the expenses of the fight of the bond
holders' protective committee shall be
paid as a part of the expenses of re
organization.
The pending case in court will have
to go on formally, and the matter of
testing the validity of the so-called
"fraudulent" bonds will be taken up in
earnest. No mention of these bonds is
made In the compromise plan. Crom
well refused to say whether this left
assenting bondholders free to attack
their validity. Untermeyer declared
that It did. At any rate they may be
attacked by non-assenting bondholders,
and some bonds may be left unassent
ing for the purpose.

Assure!
Backers of the Enterprise Are Believed
to Be George J. Gould and John
D. Rockefeller.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SALT LAKE. Feb."4. â A J60.000.000
mortgage to secure a bond issue of
an equal amount was filed by the
"Western Pacific Railway Company
with County Recorder Meeks this aft
ernoon. The papers were filed by L.
H. Farnsworth, cashier of the "Walker
Bros." Bank and agent in Utah for the
Western Pacific company. The pro
ceeds of the bond Issue are to be used
for the purchase of existing railroads
and the construction of a new road
between Salt Lake and San Francisco.
The enterprise is generally believed to
be backed by George J. Gould and
John D. Rockefeller. It is believed
the filing of the mortgage is prelim
inary to active construction work all
along the line.
The Western Pacific is looked upon
as the westernmost link of George
Gould's projected seaboard-to-coast
system. It will connect at Salt Lake
with the Rio Grande Western.
The mortgage is made to the Bowl
ing Green Trust Company, trustee. It
is a first mortgage on the railroads
and terminals acquired and on the eo
tire system, with branches hereafter
to be built. The mortgage is dated
September 1, 1903. The bonds are for
thirty years, bearing interest at 3 per
cent. The mortgage was filed here be
cause the Western Pacific is a Utah
corporation.
Although Gould has given an eva
sive denial that he Is connected with
the road, it is known that Gould men
are directing the operations from be
hind the scenes. Virgil G*. Bogue.
who is Gould's consulting engineer, has
exercised general supervision over the
surveys so far made. Other Gould
men have figured quietly in the work
from time to time.

RUSSIA'S FINAL RESPONSE
TO MIKADO IS FORWARDED
it is beiieved that their destination is Seoul. The troops will land at or near .Chemulpo.
The foundation for this report is exceptionally strong. Four companies of Russian troops have left Port
Arthur for Yongampho and points along the Yalu River. The Russian commander at Vladivostok requested
the Japanese authorities to remove all Japanese subjects immediately. These measures, in conjunction with the
dispatch of troops from Port Arthur to Seoul, have been taken while the Russian central Government is still
negotiating with Japan.
TO-DAY WILL DECIDE THE QUESTION OF PEACE OR WAR,
IS THE BELIEF OF THE DIPLOMATS IN WASHINGTON
WASHINGTON, Feb. 4.â "War or peace will come, with to-morrow."
This is the general opinion in the diplomatic c^rps." Both at the Russian embassy and at the Japanese
legation the situation in the Far East is-described as grave. ptÂ£m
It is stated at the Russian embassy that the St. Petersburg Government has made a determined and ear
nest effort for peace, even going so far as to offer magnanimous concessions in Korea.' The'question of Man
churia Russia is unwilling to discuss, taking the ground that .this is a subject for negotiations between St. Pe
tersburg and Peking and not between St. Petersburg and Tokio. In the opinion of the Russian Government
Japan's legitimate interests in Manchuria do not exceed those of the United States and Great Britain or of the
other powers signatory to the peace protocol of 1900. For this reason Russia lias declared her un-tyillingness to
discriminate among the powers and enter into a special treaty with Japan. ' ' â¢ v
In the event of war it may be expected that the Russian Government -will address the powers, setting
forth her -position and briefly reviewing the vapious steps in the negotiations. It is expected* by Russia that a
war manifesto will be immediately followed here by an official declaration of neutrality, on the part of the United
States.

RUSSIAN FLEET OFF KOREA.
Muscovite Army Is Moving Southward
From Mukden.
LONDON, Feb. 5.â The news that
Russia has already dispatched her re
ply to Japan has not yet reached the
English newspapers. The most pessi
mistic views are taken of the situation.
Reports are current that prominent
commercial houses having relations
with Japan have received private dis
patches intimating the belief that a
rupture in relations between Russia
and. Japan is imminent, but nothing of
an official character is obtainable, the
alarmist views of this morning being
based solely upon the reports of yes
terday of the sailing of the Russian
fleet from Port Arthur and the rumored
Japanese move upon Korea, which are
repeated from different points in the
Far East. â .. .
The correspondent of the Daily Mail
at Chefu says a Russian fleet, com
prising all the battleships excepting
the Sebastopol and six cruisers and
two destroyers, is cruising along the
coast of the peninsula.
The Seoul correspondent of the Daily
Mail says in a dispatch that a Russian
army is moving south from Mukden,
while the correspondent of the same
paper at Port Arthur says that both
Russia and Japan have placed an em
bargo upon coal shipment
A telegram received here'frpm Copen
hagen declares , that eighteen foreign
steamships have just been chartered by
Russia to convey war material from
Odessa and Libau to the Far East.
No confirmation of the alarming war
reports current here can be obtained at
the Japanese legation and a legation
official professes ignorance of any new
decision on the part of the Japanese
government or fresh departures in the
negotiations. The official admits, how
ever, that the legation has received
official confirmation .of the reports of
greatly increased Russian naval and
military activity in, Manchuria.
English correspondents in St. Pet
ersburg refer to an exceptional honor
which has been acco'rded the Ameri
can press. The correspondent of the
Times in St. Petersburg, who consid
ers war inevitable, declares that the
Czar's hesitation has been overcome
and thai Russia will make no conces
sion. He says:
"Up to the present time not a line
of information, or apparently a word
of inspiration, has been given the
Russian press on these- serious nego
tiations, although the American press
has been honored by the granting of
an audience by the Czar to the repre
sentative of a trans-Atlantic news
agency."
POLICE "OF NICE MAKE
A SERIOUS BLUNDER
Â» â â â
Arrest an American Named Hurt,
Mistaking Him for Man Wanted
by Parisian Authorities.
PARIS. Feb. 4. â Inquiry concerning
the detention of Hurt and Ireland,
two Americans, at Nice, has brought
out the following facts: ,.,*
On January 26 the police of Nice
arrested Hurt, considering him to be
a man named Hurst, who was wanted
by the Paris police. Ireland, on
hearing of this, went to identify Hurt,
when the former was also held as an
accomplice. The United States- con
sular office demanded proofs of
Hurt's identity. The authorities re
plied that two days would be required
for .this.
Hurt and Ireland were brought be
fore the examining magistrate at Nice
to-day, and their examination, which
was conducted in the presence of the
consular lawyer, resulted in establish
ing the fact that there were no specific
charges against them, and that their,
original detention was due to the au
thorities having mistaken Hurt for
the man Hurst.
The United States consulate imme
diately urged the prefectorial officials
to liberate them.

WAR SEEMS A CERTAINTY.
Gloomy Advices Received by the
Washington State Department.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 4.â The State
Department has received gloomy ad
vices from various points touching the
Russo-Japanese situation. One of the
most significant confirms the press dis
patch from Tokio respecting the noti
fication to Japanese at Vladivostok to
prepare to leave the town, a measure
which is rarely resorted to except when
war is regarded as an absolute cer
tainty.
Confirmation also comes of the re
ported disappearance of the Russian
fleet from Port Arthur. The destina
tion of the fleet, \s unknown, but the
surmise Is thai, the fleet has gone to
Vladivostok.
An unconfirmed rumor that six regi
ments of Russian troops have departed
from Newchwang for Korea is afloat.
It is said that, in anticipation of hos
tilities, the Japanese Government has
for months maintained a secret service
system throughout Manchuria and that
Japanese spies are now in position to
sever the Russians In Manchuria from
their base in case of war by destroy
ing every culvert and bridge on the
Manchurian Railway.
IMMENSE CHINESE ARMY.
Enlistment of Five Hundred Thousand
; ...-,. Recruits /is' Ordered.
LONDON. Fob.; 4.â It has been re
peatedly intimated by the authorities
in Peking, according to the London
Globe's Shanghai correspondent, that
in the event of China abandoning
Manchuria the powers would be com
pelled to safeguard their respective
interests in the remaining provinces,
"regardless of China's pseudo sover
eignty."
The revolutionists, continues the
correspondent, promise to raise a re
volt in Kwangtung inÂ»the middle of
February and to expel the Manchus
in the event of Manchuria being
abandoned. The Dowager Empress is
said to be wavering between Russian
offers of protection and promises of
other powers to support China against
aggression, but the predominant party,
it is asserted, is preparing to Strenu
ously resist Russia and has ordered
the enlistment of a half million new
troops and the massing of regiments
in the north. The court, in- the mean
while, It is added, continues its prep
arations for flight to Sianfu. '''<

WARNS JAPANESE TO LEAVE.
Commander of Vladivostok Garrison
Intimates War Is at Hand.
TOKIO, Feb. 4.â Premier Katsura
and his associates in the Cabinet gave
a" dinner to-day to eighteen represen
tative peers and communicated to them
the nature and progress of the dip
lomatic negotiations with Russia, The
Marquis Ito had a private audience
with the Emperor, at which the situa
tion was discussed. These and other
incidents clearly indicate the serious
ness of the situation.
It Is generally believed that Russia
is massing troops north of the Yalu
River, so as to be prepared .to resist a
possible Invasion by the Japanese.
The Cabinet, the Elder Statesmen and
commanders of the army and navy are
in almost constant conference or com
munication. There is, however, no in
dication of the course they intend to
pursue. The ' belief is prevalent that
Russia is seeking to provoke Japan to
take the initiative.
The first break in the reticence of
the Japanese Government was the pub
lication to-day of four official dispatches
from Manchuria and Siberia, which are
significant . as showing the trend of
events. . â¢"â 
..The Japanese commercial agent at
Vladivostok was. notified on Wednes
day by the commander of the Russian
garrison that he might at any time, in
accordance withÂ»orders from St. Peters
burg,'have to proclaim a state of siege.
Consequently he desired the agent to
make preparations for the eventual de
parture of Japanese residents. Should
any wish to remain they will be ordered
to repair to Habarovsk.
Japanese official reports confirm the
news of marked military activity in
Manchuria. Houses have been pre
pared at Liaoytang, Halcheng, Kai
chow and other places for the accom
modation of Russian soldiers. Carts
have been requisitioned to transport
ammunition and stores.
Troops are steadily moving in the
direction of the Yalu and the Chinese
residents of Yingchou are preparing for
flight. .
The Government has been informed
that the Russian fleet has left Port
Arthur. Its destination is not known.
Monterey Ordered to Canton.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 4. â The Navy
Department announced to-day that
the monitor Monterey has left Hong
kong for Canton. It is believed here
that the departure of the Monterey
for that place- may have been influ
enced by the report of unrest there.

traordinary facts recorded hi the, annals of
universal historyâ the departure from our
shores of the last troops the United States
had kept in Cuba after helping us to secure
our Independence and the blessings of free
dom. They could stay longer, under tome
pretext, or an unjust demand could be Im
posed upon us; but on the contrary the Gov
ernment of the United States, identified as it
is with the liberal spirit and noble character
of the American people, willingly proves its
disinterestedness' and sincerity Of the aid It
rendered urn by taking these men away and
showing us at the same time that we have, as
an Independent people,, the confidence of one of
the most powerful nations on earth.
This act of the United States In withdraw
ing its troops from Cuban territory reflects
upon it everlasting glory and makes us proud
of ourselves, for It means that nobody doubts
our ability to govern ourselves or to main
tain peace and order and guarantee the rights
of all the inhabitants of (his island.' This
new consideration Fhown ur. together with the/
services we have previously received at their
hands, will bind the Cuban people to the
American people forever In & strong tie of
sincere cratftude.
Major Brown replied to President
Palma and thanked him for his kind
ness to the American officers and sol
diers.
There were many more American
spectators present than Cubans, and
the only diplomat besides Minister
Squiers to witness the departure of the
Americans was the Chinese Minister,
who was accompanied by his staff. The
British Minister sent his regrets.

This movement hajs helped to accen
tuate the necessity of "seed grain Im
provement," and good results may be
expected shortly from planting seed
that Is uniform In size and as to time
of germination and ripening, to which
little care has been given heretofore.
The results of the late Federal elec
tions are causing much talk among the
people and discussion. in the press. The
Melbourne- Argus in an editorial lately
summed these up as follows:
The Federal elections have resulted In a de
cided accession to the ranks of the labor mem
bers. In the Senate they have gained no fewer
than six seats,' four at the expense of the Min
istry.- two at the coet of the Opposition. In
thÂ« House of Representatives the supporters
of the Ministry have dwindled from 32 tQ 26.
the Opposition remaining at 27, while the
Socialists have mounted from 10 to 22. Tha
Ministry is thus rewarded for Its submission
to the labor leaders in the last Parliament.
Far as it went. It did not go far enough; and
the commonwealth has now learned that noth-
Ingr will satisfy the extremists but the return
of men pledged to the strictest party disci
pline and bound to carry the socialistic pro
gramme to its furthest limits.
The Sydney Morning Herald says:
The position of the Ministry in the now
Federal Parliament does not promise to be a
comfortable one. The result of the Federal
elections has placed Mr. Deakin, Premier, and
the party he leads In a clear minority, both
the Opposition and Labor being: numerically
stronger. Ministers depend, no doubt, on the
6upport of Labor members, but that is not a
condition of things which either Ministerial
ists or the country can view with much com
placency. The terms of such 'support were
laid down, in the L>abor manifesto, and it it
difficult to see how any Ministry, with the
least ehred of self-respect or sense of consti
tutional responsibility could accept them, or
how a wholesome public opinion could tol
erate a government which surrendered its au
thority on euch term*.
The Argus again says:
The issue of the triangular flght which
must take place between parties In the Fed
eral Parliament Is very difficult to predict.
On the one side there is Mr. Deakin. with a
party In the House of Representatives of
twenty-six members (Including Mr. Kingston),
and In the Senate of six or seven. Opposed to
him is Mr. Reid, with a party of twenty-seven
straight-out Oppositionists (we are presuming
that Mr. Blackwood wins the Riverlna seat),
and In the Senate a following of fifteen. Be
tween these is the Labor party (and Mr.
Kingston;, the Labor party numbering twen
ty-two in one Hause and fifteen in the other.
There is little doubt that Mr. Deakin will try
to gain the support of the Labor party by
conceding all that the constitution allows him
to Â»ive.
After discussing the probable pro
gramme as to the arbitration, old age
pensions, high commisisoner, and
Federal capital bills, which will be
among the first considered, the Ar
gus winds up by saying: "The out
look is most uncertain and far from
reassuring."
The- Prime Minister in a circular
has invited joint action of all the
States of the commonwealth in the
mattter of again attracting immi
grants.
Speaking of this action, the Sydney
Morning Herald says:
There is much reason for the recommenda
tion of the Premier of the Commonwealth that
the question of immigration should receive
the attention of the .State Premiers prior to
any consideration of the debts. Where G75.-
OU<> represented the net immigration of the
Commonwealth in the ten years ended 1891,
only Â«13G were added to the population in the
following- decade. " And no improvement lipa
since set in. Well, therefore, may the ques
tion of the causes of the cessation of immi
gration be considered.
The Melbourne Argus lays the
blame for the condition of affairs on
the Government in the following:
That the tide of immigration Into Australia
from Europe has ceased to flow Is a fact to
which the Prime Minister has drawn special
attention. It will occasion surprise, as well
as satisfaction, to find that Mr. Deakin re
grets that the human stream which has its
source in Britain and other lands is no longer
attracted to our shores. Several recent events
might have led people to suppose that he
would be glad that our own countrymen and
enterprising foreigners po longer desire to
enter Australia. For the past three .years the
Government with which he has been con
nected has been building a wall to keep people
out. Now that Australia is thoroughly in
trenched he peeps over the barricades and
notes with dismay that no one, desires to
come in. ,
The Russo-Japanese imbroglio and
the outcome thereof is a matter of
great interest in Australia. The Brit
ish Government is apparently .prepar
ing for every contingency and is keep
ing in close' advice /with the defense
department. A mobilization order for
the naval reserve would surprise few
people in Australia if war becomes
imminent
â¢ In an editorial entitled "War and
Australian Defense," the Argus says:
The considerations suggested by' these
things easily raise the question as to what
Australia is ready to do in her own defense
in the event of war being declared and Great
Britain being drawn Into the conflict; or, sec
ondarily, in the event of Japan emerging \-lc
torlous from a single-handed conflict Â° with
Russia. There is a certain amount of menace
to Australia involved In either contingency.
Are we prepared to defend ourselves If at
tacked, and are we able to withstand a Jap
anese attack later on our scheme for a "white
Australia T' The questions resolve themselves
In the KimpIeNme of capacity for defense, and
with our curtailed defense expenditure and
diminished numbers, the absence of ammuni
tion factories on an adequate scale, the at
tacks of Mr. Watson and the Labor party on
the Federal military estimates, and Sir Wil
liam Lyne's ready submission to Labor dicta
tion en that subject while acting during the
absence of Sir John Forrest in England, we
have a situation which, to say the least, is
not reassuring.
Commander Colquhoun haj been
granted leave of absence by the Min
ister of Defense to go to Tokio as cor
respondent for the Times in the event
of war. The Prime Minister has stated
that Commander Colquhoun would 'also
act a* Australia's naval representative
at the front and that the special knowl
edge which he might acquire In actual
naval warfare would be placed at the
disposal of the commonwealth upon his
return.
A resort has been received by the
Minister for Mines and Agriculture
from J. B. Suttor, Government com
mercial agent in the East, on the sub
ject of trade with the Philippines. He
says the outlook certainly appears very
good for Xew South Wales' products,
and in all interviews It was impressed
upon him that the New South Wales
manufacturers should have a commer
cial museum at Manila, so as to show
our products to the best advantage.
In .the report Mr. Suttor remarks: "The
trade of the Philippines Is worth mak
ing a great effort to capture. During
the next twelve months no stone should
be left unturned to obtain a proper
footing."

PARTY POLICIES
ARE CONTRASTED
â¢ i
Senate Chamber the Arena of
an Interesting Debate on
the Day's Political Issues
LODGE VERSUS GORMAN
Harrison and Cleveland Ad
ministrations Are Compared
by the Rival Spokesmen
WASHINGTON, Feb. 4.â The Senate
chamber again to-day was the arena
of an interesting political debate, with
the provision in the urgent deficiency
Appropriation bill for a loan of $4,600,
000 for the St. Louis Exposition the
basis for the discussion.
The controversy was precipitated by
Lodge, who quoted many official figures
to demonstrate that Republican policies
had not been a failure in the United
States. Foraker also spoke, devoting
himself largely to a comparison of con
ditions under th^e Harrison administra
tion and those under the administration
of Cleveland, to the advantage of the
former. '
On the Democratic side Gorman and
Bailey were the orators. Gorman ex
plained his attitude toward the army
and navy and charged that at the close
of the Harrison administration the
treasury of the United States was in
a very bad way. Bahey followed up
this charge with an elaborate presenta
tion of statistics and contended that
the export trade of the United States
under Cleveland was greater than un
der Harrison. The exposition amend
ment had not been disposed of when
the Senate adjourned.
Newlands of Nevada denied Spoon
er's charge that In his speech at Omaha
he had repudiated the anti-imperial
istic issue. Speaking of the recently
negotiated treaty with Cuba Newlands
said that we were seeking exclusive
privileges in that island, because trust
prices were such in the United States
that we could not compete with other
countries in our Cuban, trade on a
natural basis.
FAVORS A STRONG NAVY.
Lodge defended the Republican ad
ministration against the charge of neg
lecting other afeairs in the interest of
the army and navy. He considered
that the navy outweighed all others of
our institutions in importance and that
It was the "last place to economize and
the first place to spend." He would
economize, if economize we must, In
expositions and fairs and not on the
defense of the country.
Gorman disclaimed any intention to
follow Lodge in comparing the Cleve
land administration with others,' for it
could not be made fairly. Yet it was,
he said, fair to say that Cleveland had
been compelled to. meet. a condition in
the treasury so serious that a Repub
lican Secretary of the Treasury had
said that bankruptcy was threatened.
Certainly the Democratic administra
tion was not responsible for that con
dition.
Commenting on the present condition
of the country's finances Gorman said
that it was due to the immense ex
penditures made In preparation for war
â$82,000,000 last year for the navy and
$118,000,000 for the armyâ m a time of
profound peace. He denied that he
had been an enemy of the upbuilding
of the navy. 6n the contrary he would
have a navy ample to guard American
interests everywhere. But he had no
idea of a navy to compete with that of
Great Britain or Germany, because our
conditions did not require such a navy.
He did not want a navy for display,
but for service.
"I want economy in it," he said, and
he called attention to the effectual aid
given to Venezuela during the Cleve
land administration.
COST OF OUR SEA FORCE.
"We did that," he said," as a cost of
$16,000,000 a year, and now we pay
$82,000,000 a year for a navy which is
to threaten Colombia."
He would reduce the expenditures
in the navy and he would scale the
army down from 100,000 men, as now
authorized, to 50,000 men.
Gorman commended the removal of
our fleet from the scene of trouble in
the Orient by order of the President,
saying the brave commander of the
fleet would like a part In any trouble.
It was rumored, he went on, in
high naval circles that the United
States was marching around the globe
with a chip on its shoulder with a
taunt to Germany to knock it off.
Foraker announced his support Vof
the exposition amendment and ex
pressed regret that the question should
have been given a political hue. He
expressed surprise at Gorman's re
marks concerning the condition of the
finances of the country at the close of
Harrison's administration. He re
called the panic of 1893, which, he
declared, was precipitated by the elec
tion of Cleveland on a platform pledg
ing the repeal of the McKinley tariff
law and the substitution of a tariff fpr
revenue only.
Patterson of Colorado asked For
aker how he accounted for the cut In
the wages of the textile and steel
workers and the miners of the bitu
minous coal fields, in view of his con
tention that prosperity was uninter
rupted.
FORAKER DEFENDS THE ARMY.
Foraker replied that the reduction
of the wages In textile workers was
due to the advance in the price of
cotton. As for the other reductions,
it was no unuffual thing to make
changes in wages. He defended the
army and said" it cost relatively more
than that of other countries because
it v/as composed of citizens temporar
ily serving their country, but still citi
zens.
Bailey said that no one party was
responsible for all that was good in
the times â that was the joint product
of God and man. It was not true, he
said, that the Democratic party was
the party of hard* times.
He added:
"Unpopular as was Mr. Cleveland,
he was not more so than will be the
man whom you will elect next Novem
ber, if you elect one. In fact, I have
never known of a candidate whom
so many favor and so few want as the
present occupant of the White
House.'! :

Moving an Adjournment
DIPLOMATIC BILL PASSES
Measure Carries a Trifle Less
Than Two Million Dollars
and Is Not Amended
WASHINGTON, Feb. 4.â The anima
tion of yesterday was completely lack
ing in the proceedings of the House to
day. The principal feature of the day
was the rivalry between Republican
leaders for the honor of moving an ad
journment. The diplomatic and consu
lar appropriation bill had been disposed
of, and Chairman Hitt, in charge of the
measure, left early, as did Payne, the
floor leader. Hitt requested Dalzell to
"watch things" and move to adjourn
when the proper time came.
Payne met Grosvenor in the corridor
on going out and asked him to "watch
things and move to adjourn."
Several bills were passed by unan
imous consent- after the diplomatic bill
had been disposed of, and after each
Dalzell tried to make the adjournment
motion. He was finally recognized by
the Speaker and had the motion on his
tongue's end when Grosvenor, with a
twinkle in his eye, bounded to his feet
and frantically addressed the chair.
"For what purpose does the gentle
man arise?" queried Speaker Cannon.
"I wish to move that the House ad
journ," demurely replied Grosvenor.
His motion prevailed.
The diplomatic bill, carrying $1,995,
600, was passed without amendment.
Everything but the bill was discussed
during Its consideration. Morrell of
Pennsylvania led with an argument for
some system of building up the Ameri
can merchant marine. . A Democratic
political speech by Hamlin of Missouri
followed, and received a. brief reply
from Fuller of Illinois. Lind of Minne
sota spoke for Canadian reciprocity.
Government Owns One Automobile.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 4.â Secretary
Cortelyou, in replying to the inquiry
of the House as to the number of car
riages, etc., maintaned at Government
expense for the use of heads of his
department, discloses the first auto
mobile thus far revealed as belonging
to the Government in answers made
to the Government Vehicle query.
There are eight carriage horses used
in his department, the Secretary says,
costing $4260, and harness costing
$985. Four men are detailed to drive
and care for the livery at an annual
salary of $2850.
. Agricultural Bill Is Reported.
â¢WASHINGTON, Feb. 4. â The agri

to the House to-day, carries a total
of $5,711,240, an increase of $233,000

PERKINS MAKES
STRONG SPEECH
Senator From California Ad
dresses Committee on Matter
of Selection of Camp Ground
OPPOSES NAMING- OF SITE
Believes That War Department
Should Be Allowed to Deter
mine Most Desirable Location
Bpecial Dispatch to The Call.
CALL BUREAU, HOTEL BARTON.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 4.â A hearing
took place before the Committee on
Military Affairs to-day on the matter
of the selection of a camp and maneu
ver ground in California. Senator
Perkins made a " strong argument
agrainst naming either of the ranches
that have been referred to, but advo
cated instead that the matter be left
to the War Department to make the
choice. He advocated that the site be
recommended generally to be located
within an area embraced in Monterey,
San Luis Obispo, Santa Cruz and
Santa Barbara counties. He warned
the committee against being influenced
by the arguments of real estate deal
ers or persons interested individually
in either ranch. He also referred to
the fact that the appropriation for the
purchase as contemplated amounted to
$300,000^ while the Henry ranch will re
quire $500,000. Without regard to this,
however, he said the responsibility for
the choice should properly rest with
the War Department. Insistence on
naming any particular location would
doubtless result in opposition and dis
sension and cause delay in determin
ing the matter.
Representative Daniels also spoke
along the same lines.
Judge Stevens of Iowa made the ar
gument inbehalf of the Henry ranch.
He is a brother-in-law of J. H. Henry,
owner of the ranch.
Ex-Secretary of the Navy Herbert
appeared as attorney for the owners
of Nacimlento. He dwelt particularly
on the sanitary conditions of the prop
erty in contradiction of reports to the
contrary. The hearing was postponed
for one week.' - : â¢
Senator Perkins submitted a report
from the Committee on Fisheries to
day authorizing the establishment of a
scientific fish station at San Pedro, as
recommended by Professor Ritter of
the California State University. This
bill was introduced last session also,
but failed at that time to secure a
favorably report.

POSTAL TRIAL
MOVES SLOWLY
George E. lorenz Tells of His
Dealing's With Â°Machen and
Explains Money Transactions
STRANGE REQUEST MADE
Attorney Conrad Asks Court to
. Instruct Witness Not to Talk
to Any One During Recess
WASHINGTON. Feb. 4.â George E.
Lorenz was on the witness stand in
the postal trial to-day. He produced a
number of drafts, checks and sight
drafts which passed between Machen
and himself, and declared that they
were ail In payment of his note for
$25,000. which he gave Machen when
the latter in 1S93 assigned his Interest
in the oil properties. Settlements with
Machen. he said, were made annually,
the note finally being canceled as paid,
on December 16, 1903. All the money
transactions, he said, between Machen
and himself referred to by the Govern
ment related solely to this Indebtedness
to Machen. When the money com
menced to come from D. B. Groff in
1S95 Lorenz said that he determined to
turn over to Machen one-half of his
profits in the fastener. This he did, he
testified, until he became pressed for
money, and then he sejit Machen only
what he could spare, and when he be
came easier financially Machen got his
remittances as on previous occasions.
Just before the recess Attorney Con
rad provoked a heated argument by
requesting the court* to instruct Lo
renz not to talk to any one, not even
hi3 counsel, during the luncheon hour.
The court denied the request. Attor
ney Douglass of counsel for the de
fense vigorously resented what he said
was a reflection on him and his asso
ciates, and called attention to the fact
that in all the history of the District
Courts this was the first time any such
request had been made.

DR. ALBERT SHAW LECTURES
AT THE STATE UNIVERSITY
"Morals of Trade"
Is Editor's Sub
ject.
In the presence of a large audience
that filled Hearst Hall last night Dr.
Albert Shaw, editor of the Review of
Reviews, delivered the first annual lec
ture under the Barbara V.'einstock lec
tureship on "The Morals of Trade."
This lectureship was founded by
Henry Weinstock of Sacramento, with
an endowment <rf $5000. a sunv suffi
cient to allow of one lecture a year.
The general subject for all the lectures
is "The Moral j of Trade," a theme that
will provide many thoughtful discus
sions in the future. In order to under
stand Mr. Weinstock's object in creat
ing this lectureship, his statement to
President Wheeler at the time of its
founding may be taken into account.
It reads a* follows:

AGK OF (OMMKKCIAMSJI.
Dr. Shaw declared that he did not
propose to warn his hearers to study
jiemil codes or to Ftudy the definitions
of prand and potty larceny in order to
fully understand the moral? of trade.
He then referred to the various recog
nized professions and the ethics that
povern them, and said that no man
was a true member of a profession
â who did not admit, both in theory and
in practice, that he had a public func
tion to serve and that he must fre
quently be at some discomfort or dis
advantage because of the calls of pro
fessional duty.
"The lawyer bears an important pub
lic relation in the dispensing of jus
tice," said Dr. Shaw, "and to the pro
tection of the Innocent and feeble. The
physician's public obligation is in part
prescribed by the laws of the State and
by the codes evolved by the profes
sion itself for its own guidance. I need
not refer to the unselfish devotion of
most of the members of tie clerical
profession, for this is evident to all
observant cersons
"It is clear enough, in the case of a
professional man. that he is false to
his profession and to his plain obliga
tions if he shows himself to be ruled
by the anti-social spirit: that is to say,
if h> considers himself absolved from
any duties toward the community about
him "
In the category with the three pro
fession? above mentioned the speaker
added those of teaching, architecture,
chemistry, engineering and electricity,
mining and Journalism.
POSITIVE ETHICAL STANDARDS.
In speaking of the professions men
tioned Dr. Shaw went quite deeply into
the subject. In part he said: â¢
In Â«II the** callings It Ik demanded not
merely that men fhall be mbject to the pri
vate rulen of conductâ that they muM not

standards that relate to the welfare of the
whole community, and that require or then*
the exercis* of a true public spirit.
After a scholarly analysis of the
*Â»thical characteristics of professional
life. Dr. Shaw said:

CAPITALISM A BOON TO MAX.
Dr. Shaw then said that the eco
nomic progress of the past century,
often termed "capitalism," was an im
measurable boon to mankind. He
said that the progress of the last cen
tury h;td swept away many evils by
forcing itself into a world of poverty,
of disease, of depraved public life, of
low morals pervading the community
â a world of class distinctions in
which the BUÂ»tÂ«Â» of the vast majority
was little better than that of serfs

that followed a development of wealth

law of wages." and then described the
gradual betterment of affairs due to
th* sheer creation of capital and the
discipline and training of workers.
In referring to the vast system of
transportation in this' country, Dr.
Shaw sai.i that the roads were passing
out of the hands of stockjobbers and
speculators into the control of trained
men who recognized that their duty
was to work for the public and not
against it.
"We have reached a point." he said,
"where their relations to all the elab
orate interests of the community are
such that their public character be
comes more and more pronounced and
evident."
DUTIES OF COUPOBATIOXS.
Quoting President C. P. Slellen of
the Xew York, New Haven and Hart
ford Railroad, that "publicity should
rule the roads, and that they must
take the public into their confidence
and ask for what they want and no
more," the speaker said:
Mr. Mellen's state of mind is that which
ought to 1 lev.-iii among all the managers of
corporations which enjoy public franchises
and perform functions fundamental to the
welfare of the community. There will at
times lie prejudice and passion on the part ot;
the public, and unfair demands will be made.
The t=ame thing is clearly true when one
considers nowadays the delicate and important
functions of the world of banking and finance.
The banks are not merely private money
making institutions, but have public functions
that admittedly affect the whole social or-'
gani*=ir. from the Government Itself down to
the humblest laborer. ThÂ»y must concern
themselves about the soundness and the suf
ficiency of the monetary circulation: they
must protect the credit and foster the welfare
DUCHESS HELPS
MRS. MAYBRICK
Prisoner's Release From Ayles
bury Due to the Mediation
yof a Kindly English AVonum
LONDON. Feb. 4.â Mrs. Florence
Maybrick is now in a home In a distant
part of England and under the care of
the members of a religious sisterhood.
She has not been released' and she is
kept under surveillance, but to all In
tents and purposes her. life now, com
pared to hÂ«fr existence in Aylesbury
prison, is that of a free woman. She
will remain where she is until next
July, when her punishment will be end
ed under special license and she will be
allowed to go free, subject to the usual
conditions â  governing ticket-of-le.ave
convicts.
The transfer of Mrs. Maybrick from
a penal prison to a quiet country home
constitutes an almost unprecedented
action on the part of the authorities. It
was due to the mediation of Adeline
Marie, Duchess of Bedford, who as a
visitor to Aylesbury prison for many
years has taken a keen personal inter
est in Mrs. Maybrick and finally suc
ceeded in obtaining the mitigation of
punishment to the extent of her being
allowed to spend the last six months
of her confinement outside the prison
walls. The Home Office several months
ago agreed to meet the request of the
Duchess of Bedford, although it Inv
posed a pledge of secrecy. Therefore" in
order to permit her hair to grow. out
again and for the recuperation of her
health Mrs. Maybrick was quietly
transferred to this private institution,
where, although she Is still actually a
convict under a life sentence, she lives
in a freedom that belies her real status.
Her exact whereabouts is guarded
with extraordinary secrecy, chiefly for
the purpose of preventing criticism of
the Government for having taken the
foregoing exceptional steps In her case.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 4.â In view of
the suggestion that has been made in
the press to the effect that Mrs. May
brick when released from, prison will
not be permitted to land in the United
States on the ground that she has been
a convict. It is learned that that. issue

DR. SENN'S AID
Chicago's Famous Surgeon Will
Head Japan's Field Corps If
War With Russia Is Declared
UNDERSTANDING EXISTS
Noted Authority Returns From
a Visit to Tahiti, the Land
of Sleep and Contentment
Dr. Nicholas Senn,' one of the most
eminent surgeons in the United States
and professor of surgery of the Uni
versity of Chicago, arrived here yes
terday on the steamship Mariposa
from, Tahiti, where he spent his mid
winter vacation. The gentleman is
hurrying back to Chicago to arrange
his private affairs and prepare him
self for an expected call to Japan to
assume charge of the surgical depart
ment of the Japanese army. Two
years ago, while visiting Japan, Dr.
Senn was the guest of the highest
medical officials of the Government
and was given a banquet by the of
ficers of the Red Cross Society of the
empire, under whose charge the army
medical department is directed. The
late Prince Kumatsu. who was then
president of the Red Cross Society of
that country, acting on beh'alf of the
Government, solicited the services of
the noted Chicago surgeon in the
event of war, and an agreement was
entered into that Dr. Senn should go
to Japan if hostilities were declared.
In speaking of the matter at the Pal
ace Hotel last evening the doctor said:
liAHGE MEDICAL COUPS.
"If my services are needed I will
quickly respond and will probably
take a corps of surgeons with me: It
must pot be understood, however,
that Japan is wanting in" the way of
surgeons. On the contrary, she has a
large vand most proficient .corps, men
who studied abroad and graduated
with high distinction. The Red Cross
Society of Japan, of which I have the
honor to be a member, .is composed
of 8000 members and is the strongest
organization of its kind in the world.
It is absolutely ready for war and
its ambulances and field corps could
be called to a battle-field on the very
shortest notice. When 1 was in Japan
I saw plainly the treYid of affairs and
readily predicted war in the near fu
ture and remarked the fact at a ban
quet given me } by Prince Kumatsu,
who has since passed away."
Dr. Senn, during his stay in Tahiti,
made' a close study of the conditions
and the customs of the natives of the
islands, and recalling his observations
last evening he said:
I have visited many countries during my
tlmÂ» and have been interested in many differ
ent people but none have so deeply interested
me aTthe 1 .simple native* of Tahiti, a race of
happv. honest, forbearing, but dreamy j^ople.
which is, fad to relate, doomed to extinction
by civilisation. When Cook landed at TahKl
In 17fl!> he found a population of 200.0W 10
day it numbers only ll.ooo. of which 800 are
whites and 300 Chinese. Infectious dl"*"^
Huch as measles, whooping cough and the like,
have in the last few y*Â»rÂ» spread among the
people in epldejnics with fearful devastating
results. Diseases of the simplest forms, which
ha've no apparent effect on the whites, cannot
be combated by the natives- who knew noth
ing of these ailments during their primitive
state.
The causes and effects of. these dis
eases were closely studied by Dr. S&nn
and he readily arrived at the conclu
sion that the natural indolence of the
natives had much to do with it and
that civilization has greatly tended to
aggravate the " sickness prevalent
amons- the. people. Upon this subject
he'Tsaid:,
Such absofute Indolence I never observed be
fore In all my travels. A man is compelled
to perform no manual labor to provide himself
with food, for It in furnished by nature In the
woods adjoining his habitation. Aljout t'2 a
year will furnish him with the* necessary
clothing, which Is nothing more than a breech
clout. There is no abject poverty, no begging
and no crime. The people are happy and con
tented under the administration of tfie French
Government. -They dislike the French lan
guage, preferring their native tongue, and for
that reason they have taken more* kindly to
the parochial s-cJiools, where they are taught
their own language. Much of the present
sickness among the natives will, I believe,
soon be remedied when the commission of
French .doctors, now there, has determined on
a plan for sanitary relief, which I think wyi
begin with vaccination, against which, of,
course, the natives will at first rebel, for they
know nothing of modern methods of physi
cians.
A I4AND OF REST.
One thing that deeply impressed me while
In Tahiti was the restful condition of the In
habitants, p|vieclally the whites. In fact,' *I
know of no better spot on earth where the un
fortunates, suffering from nervous diseases,
can obtain more ready and permanent relief
from this affliction than at {Tahiti. In fact,
it Is the land of sleep and contentment, and I
.purpose tor auvlse my future patients to make
the trip for- the Bake of their health, to say
nothing of â  the other attractions that will
await them there. The sea voyage on tne
steamer MaripQsn, fitted as' she is like a
floating hotel. In Itself Is a cure .for the ner
vously afflicted and will well repay them In
health of both mind and body. The surf for
ever beats upon the beaches, where plumy
palms abound, the drives, mountains and riv
ers are picturesque, and nowhere bn earth is
there so close a duplication of paradise.
Says He Was Robbed.
M. T. Smith, a laborer living at 323
Jessie street, wasjlound at Third and
Townsend streets "on Wednesday even
ing intoxicated and bleeding from a
wound on the forehead. He was sent
to the Central Emergency Hospital
and after his wound was dressed he
complained that he had been robbed

Regan and O'Cbnnell took him to

was unable, to say how or by whom

Alexander Murdock filed a suit yes

D. Collins. The plaintiff alleges that
Kehrlein deposited the money with Col

ploy a substitute for a short time and
see if it will not more than repay you
in results.
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets are a
willing ami most efficient substitute. "
They themselves digest every bit of
food in the stomach in just the sam f >
way that the stomach itself would
were it well. They contain all the es-
sential elements that the gastric Juice
and other digestive fluids . of the
stomach contain and actually act just
the same and do just the same work aa
the natural fluids would do. were ths
stomach well and sound. They there-
fore relieve the stomach, *aSt as one
workman relievos another, and permit
it to rest ar^ recuperate and regain its
normal health and strength.
This "vacation? idea was suggested
by the letter of a prominent lawyer in
Chicago. ' Read what he says: "I waa
engaged in the most momentous un-
dertaking of my life in bringing about
the coalition of certain great interests
that meant much to me as well as my
clients. It was not the work of days,
but of months; I was working night
and day almost, when at a very critical
time my stomach went clear back on
me. The undue mental strain brought
It about "and hurried up what would
have happened later on.
"What I ate I had to literally fo^Â«
down and that was a source of misery,
as I had a sour s.tomach much of the
time. My head ached, I waa sluggish
and began to lose my ambition to
carry out my undertaking. It looked
pretty gloomy for me and I 'confided
my plight to one of my clients. He
had been -cured by Stuart's Dyspepsia
Tablets and at once went down to a
drug store and brought a box up to
the office.
"I had not taken a quarter of that
box before I found that they would do
i all the work my ' stomach ever did;
a. id as a rest or vacation was out of
j the question for me, I determined' *.o
I give my stomach a vacation. I kept
; right on taking the tablets and braced
I U[. and went ahead with my work with
renewed vigor, ate Just as much as I
ever did and carried out that under-
taking to a successful issue. I feel
that I have Stuarts Dyspepsia Tablets
to thsnk for saving me the handsomest
fee I ever received, as well as my repu-
tation, and, last but not least, my
stomach."
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets, are for
sale by all druggists at 50 cents a box.

In tfce interior of '.California the
wind was less rtolent. In Ne
vada a velocity of fifty-tvro

Snow was faUlnz on the Coast
Range and hi the Sierras last
night. Forecaster McAdie says
there win probably be a ll^ht
snowfall on Mount Tnm.tlpals
to-day.
The storm first appeared on
the 'Washington coast last Tues

very slowly and had reached
the Tehachapi at 5 o'clock la*t
evening- The barometer pres
sure was very low. At some
points in the State the twenty

been reached. The heaviest
rainfall was at San Lot* Obispo
and amounted to .68 of an inch.
The rainfall In San Francisco

SPRINKLE IN SAX JOAQUIN.
STOCKTON. Feb. 4.â The rain to
day was general throughout the coun
trv, the fall varying from a mere
I sprinkle to nearly half an inch. In
1 this city the fan was but .02 inch,
j while Tracy had not enough precipita
! tion to lay the dust- Lcdi and Farm
! Ligton had nearly half an inch, while
â¢' a OiUartT of an inch fell to the south
I cf Lookefnrd. With the exception of
i the crops about Tracy en the west side
j the grain in this county Is doing nicelj.
â¢ but the counties to the south of here
] are very much in need of moisture.
MILTON. Feb. 4.â Rain has fallen at
i interval; here to-day and with a brisk
! southeast wind and a heavily overcast
.â¢ alcy the prospects for a considerable
' storm are excellent. While the ground
1 is not particularly dry in this section
j the cold weather and heavy frosts have
I set feed back, and chie*y for this rea
; son the tueiiuit storm is very welcome.
HOLLISTEP.. Feb. 4.â Rain com
menced ta fall at He Ulster at 1 o'clock
this afternoon- Twenty-six -iiundredths
fell In three hours. It is raining heav
ier. Feed will start up again and hay
and graia crops with the usual spring
rains ar<? assured. No stock has c^m
moved frcm the county.

SHOWERS IX SAN JOSE.
SAN JOSE. Feb. 4.â There were a
number cf showers to-day, and there
is every indication fc-r a gocd rainfalL
A south wind brought a number cf
light showers this morning and thi3
afternoon there was a gocd ehower.
Up to this date Jast year 3.rr inches
had fallen, while this season but 3.42
inches are recorded. Last year during
the month cf February 2.04 inches fell,
but in 1302 during February the pre
cipitation amounted to 6."5 inche3.' A
geed rain new would be beneficial and
place the farmers in a pleasant frame
cf mind. The last rain the
grain up and" a atorm will make it
grow fast- Rain Is needed more en
the cattle ranges and in the foothills
than anywhere else. Feed en the
ranges is shcrt. but a heavy stora, fol
lowed; by some warm weather, will
make the grass grow rapidly. There
has been plenty of rain so- far for the
cultivation cf the orchards and good
rains during this menth and March will
bring the trees oui fine- While the
rainfall In Santa, Clara County Is be
low the average so far this year, the
farmers and crchardist* still believe ,
there will be plenty cf rain yet In sei
ioa and they are not inclined to the cry
that this win be a dry year.

WOODLAND, Feb. 4.â The first rain
for more than a moata began falling
here to-day. It began raining at I
o'clock this morning- and rained stead
ily until noon and at intervals all dur
ing the afternoon. Tee precipitation
ha3 not been much, but what has fallen

DEXON, Feb. 4.â Rain began falling
at 7:20 o'clock this morning and con
tinued for four hours. It came just in
the right time- Farmers are rejoicing,
as the prospects for ?t?od crops were
never better in Solano County. If they
have one or two more good downpours
they will reap a golden haxvest from
their growing grain.
SAN RAFAEL. Feb. 4. â Marin
County has received a copious rain
fall within, the last twelve hours.
From all points in the county reports
come that the precipitation has been
heavy and attended by strong winds.

wind was blowing a gra.le in this vicin
ity. The precipitation for San P^afael
and vicinity for the present storm has
been about half an Inch; for the sea
son sixteen inches. While rain 13
not seriously needed In. Harin Coun
ty, an inch or so will cau3e no dam
age. The precipitation for this season
is not e<iual to that of last year up to
same date. Indications point to .con
tinuation of storm, during the night.
SACRAMENTO, Feb. 4.â While the
rain, which started in at S o'clock this
morning. Is welcomed in Northern
California, it is not a necessity in this
portion of the State, where the green
feed 13 ample and plowing has been
going on without interruption. Weath
er Observer J. H. Scarr said that while
the total precipitation this season Is
a little less than half the normal
amount, nevertheless that half has
been so distributed as to do the max
imum amount of good. Besides the
rainfall. November and December
had an unusual amount of fog. which
not only prevented evaporation from.
the soil, but actually deposited 5fteen
hundredth3 of an inch of moisture.
Observer Scarr said the indications
favor a generous downpour in north
ern and Central California.
Showers Brinz Delisht.
OAKLAND. Feb. 4. â The showers of
to-day have brought delight to Ala
meda and Contra Costa counties. The
western valleys of these two counties
are more favored than some sections
of California and they get more rain
and need less than the southland. The
Uvermcre Valley, to the south, of
llount Diablo, and the San Ramon
Valley, to the west, and the Alameda
Valley, en the shore3 of San Fran
cisco Bay, have not suffered for rain,
but. at the same time, the precipita
tion to-day was decidedly gratefuL
At Livermore it is reported that
nearly half an inch of rain has fallen
during the day. with prospects of
more. Thl3 is ample for the agricul
tural sections, while a little more
would be useful to the grazing re
gions.
Through the San Ramon Valley
fruit is in gocd condition. W. A. Rog
ers, at 'Walnut Creek, reports that if
the ordinary amount of rain falls from,
now on that the crops will be the larg
est in the history of his section.

FALL OF SNOW
STOPS TRAVEL
Storm Basres in the "Thumb"
District of Michigan and
Railroad Lines Are Blocked
DETROIT, Feb. 4. â Storm reports
from the "Thumb" district of Michigan
to-night are disappointing. A snow
plow which succeeded in working
south from Harbtir B<each to Port Hu
ron yesterday was started northward
to-day, but on the return trip made lit
tle progress. The Pere Marquette line.
being exposed to the winds from Lake
Huron, Is buried In snow drifts before
the opening made by the snow plow
can be made use of.
It Is ninety miles frcm Port Huron
to Port Austin and reports received to
night shew that the snow plow and
relief train which started at 2 p. in.
had worked northward only about
twenty miles.
At Palm station, fifty miles from
Port Huron, there is a Junction and
the snowbound village of Harbcr
Beach Is situated eighteen miles frcm
Palms, on the branch line.
The Sagi-''aw-Port Huron branch cf
the Pere Marquette i3 blocked between
Harlette and Brown City, where the
eastbound train that left Saginaw for
Port Huron at 7 a. m. Is snowed in. The
westbound train that left Port Huron
at 8:5') p. no. is at Brown. City, unable
to proceed until the eastbound trafn i
released.
Earlier tn the day it was thought
that the Port Huron-Saginaw line was
open, but the cuts were filled with snow
before to-day's trains could get
thro-ugn.

Is of Great Benefitâ Approve Webster-Street Fill
PRESIDENT OF THE ALAMEDA COUNTY REAL ESTATE DEALERS*
ASSOCIATION. WHO APPROVES ACTION OF THE CALL IN RUN
NING OAKLAND NETWS THROUGH ALL EDITIONS.
OAKLAND, Feb. 4.â The Alameda
County Real Estate Dealers' Associa
tion to-nÂ«sht took up several matters
of interest to Oakland, the principal of
which was the running of Oakland
news through all editions of the San
Francisco prees. President F. J. Wood
ward of the association brought the
matter up and there were numerous
speeches made indorsing the action of
the San FranciÂ«co Call for giving its
Oakland news publicity to the world.
George Austin, the' Taylor brother?,
Edward Laymance and many others
addressed the association upon the ad
vantages that were to be derived from
this move of the San Francisco Call in
FEDERAL JURY
INDICTS AGENTS
Learns That Kansas Express
Companies Have Been Vio
lating the Prohibition Laws
KANSAS CITY, Mo., Feb. 4.âWhole
sale indictments by the i'ederal Grand
Jury of express agents in Kansas City,
throughout Kansas and in the prohi
bition counties Of Texas and of liquor
dealers- who have been shipping liquor
into these prohibition States are. im
minent, the result of a movement start
ed by John W. Tcrkes, Commissioner
of Internal Revenue at Washington.
. The local agents of three large whole
sale liquor houses, it was announced
to-day, were indicted and arrested yes
terday, but released on their own* re
cognizance. Additional bills, it Is said,
will be found against the agent of
every express company in Kansas City,
in the State of Kansas and in the pro
hibition counties of Texas who have
acted as agents for liquor houses in
selling whisky.
For years practically every express
company in this part of the Southwest
has acted as the agency for liquor com
panies that have sold liquor in Kansas
and Texas, the express agents of the
different companies acting nominally as
agents at the various points, thus prac
tically nullifying the prohibitory law.
To avoid the law the whisky wag sent
in sealed packages addressed to Ficti
tlcrus names and sold by the agents for
"express charges." Millions of cases
of 'whisky have been sent Into Kansas
yearly, and for each case disposed of
the express agents were allowed 50
cents. This naturally has proven not
only a violation of the prohibition laws
of the States named, but has deprived
the Federal Government of an immense
amount of revenue.
It was stated to-day that the Fed
eral Government has sent dozens of
agents into Kansas and parts of Texas
affected to gain evidence upon which
to convict the offenders.
The three Kansas City liquor deaTers
were indicted by a Federal Grand dury
sitting at Wichita. Kans., and the in
dictments sent to the office of the
United States District Attorney here
for service.
LOS AKGELES. Feb. 4.â TbÂ« Coroner 1 *

givin? the entire circulation of the
pa&er the full benefit of the Oakland
news.
At the conclusion of the discussion a
resolution was adopted indorsing the
action of the only San Francisco paper
that has recognized the advancement
of the interests of the eastern side of
the bay-
The association also indorsed the Im
provement of the Webster street fill
betueen Oakland and - Alameda and
recommended the passage of a definite
building ordinance for the city of Oak
land. The excursion to Los Angeles
was also approved and nearly all of
the members will avail themselves of
the opportunity to visit the boomland

ProfrÂ«sor Irving Strinsham Says
Methods in Vogue Arc Away Be-
hind the Times.
BERKELEY, Feb. 4.â Professor Irv
ing Stringham. head of the department
of mathematics at the University of
California, says that the methods in
vegue among the teachers of the public
schools' of the State are obsolete. In
his classroom yesterday he said that
the pedagogues teach the same methyls
that they learned when they went to
school years ago, regardless of the fact
that there has been large Improvement.
Most striking of these derelictions, he
says, is that in regard to the method
for extracting the cube root The
roundabout way used in the schools
may be good training Tor the mind.
Professor Stringham saye. but it is not
economy. "When the graduates of the
secondary schools enter the university
they have to be taught all over again.

draped in violet and gold, the carnival
colors of 1904.
Over the vast skylight hangs a drape

PROMINENT ENGINEER GONE.
Captain Stevenson of Pacific Mail
Company Dies at Livermore.
. LIVERMORE. Feb. 4.â Captain John
Stevenson, who was for thirty years
chief engineer of the Pacific Mall
Steamship Company, died this morning
at his residence two miles south of
here from cancer of the throat. He
was 68 years of age and up to three
months ago was the head of the me
chanical department of the big steam
.shlp company, a position of great
trust.
Captain Stevenson was a native of
Liverpool. England, and came to this
country early in life. In the early days
of the white occupation of this coast
he was seized with a desire to make his
fortune on this side of the continent
and he entered the employ of the Pa
cific Mali Steamship Company, then
the greatest carrier of freight and pas
sengers on the Pacific Ocean. He made
himself so valuable to the company that,
he was soon made chief engineer, with
headquarters in San Francisco, and
was given general supervision over all
of the vessels of the company plying
on the Pacific Ocean.
Captain Stevenson became afflicted
with caaicer of the throat, the same dis
ease that attacked President Grant,
and just before the new year he was
compelled to retire to his ranch near
this city. Death came quietly this
morning.
The deceased leaves a wife, Mrs.
Sarah Stevenson, three sons and one
daughter. The funeral will take place
Saturday in San Francisco under the
auspices of California Lodge No. 1,
of Masons, of which he was a member.
He was also a member of the Knights
of Honor and the Marine Engineers'
Association of the United States.
Passing of Professor Fellner.
LOS ANGELES, Feb. A.â The re
mains of Professor Alexander Fellner,
who died at Santa Monica and who un
til ten years ago was one of the most
famous teachers of music In the Mid
dle West, were brought to this city

Professor Fellner dropped dead of
apoplexy while he was entertaining a
friend at his home in Santa Municar
He had gone to the kitchen for some
refreshments. While returning he
stumbled and fell and when assistance
reached him he wÂ«s dead. He 's the
third of his immediate family to die
in that manner.
Born in Budapest, Hungary, Alex
ander Fellner tarly began his musical
studies and soon attracted attention to
himself by his proficiency. He became
a pupil of Marches! and pursued the
study of music, science and languages
throughout Europe. He spoke seven
languages fluently and was a deep stu
dent in Latin. Greek and Hebrew.' His
greatest bid to fame was as the com
poser of oratorios and in his presenta
tion of "Pinafore" he' made himself a

CYCLONIC
WIND LIFTS
THE HOUSES
Damaging Gale Strikes a Por
tion of a Nevada City and
Some of the People Run to
Their Cellars for Safety
HOTEL IS SWITCHED
FROM THE FOUNDATION
One Barn Is Turned Upside
Down and Many Fences Are
Wrecked, but the Total
Loss Is Not Very Large
Special Dispatch to The Call.
RENO, .New, Feb. 4.â This city was
visited by a small cyclone early this
morning. It aroused the populace from
slumber and drove many in the west
end of the town to their cellars. The
damage done in this city was com
paratively small, however.
The gale spent its fury at East Reno,
the new railroad town two miles east
of here, where the loss runs well Into
the hundreds. The Stone building, a
structure 70 by 30 feet and two stories
high, was torn from its foundation and
"the walls were crushed together. The
occupants had a narrow escape, barely
getting out before the walls collapsed.
The proprietor was the last to leave
the building and was slightly injured
by the flying timbers.
The Wah Hoo Hotel was lifted from
its foundation and carried several feet
eastward. There it collapsed and is a
total loss. The U and I saloon was
moved nearly a foot from its former
position, but can be repaired with little
loss. Many structures in addition to
those named were more or less dam
aged.
At this time the loss has not been
definitely stated, but is probably in the
neighborhood of $2000. Upson's barn
in the eastern part of the city was
turned completely upside down. Joe
Williams suffered considerable loss at
his ranch west of town. A large hay
stack containing 200 tons of choice al
falfa hay was blown over and scattered
over an area of a quarter of a mile./
Fences throughout town suffered and
branches of trees were strewn about
the streets.
The wind at this point attained a ve
locity of seventy miles an hour and at
East Reno it was reported at ninety
miles an hour. A welcome rain and
snow storm followed the blizzard.

STANFORD STUDENTS HOLD
FIRST GENERAL ASSEMBLY
President Jordan and Dr. Harry B.
Reynolds, President of the Alumni,
Deliver Interesting Addresses.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Feb 3.
The first general assembly of the
semester was held in Assembly Hall
this morning. Dr. Harry B. Rey
nolds of San Francisco, president of
the Stanford Alumni Association, and
President Jordan addressed the stu
dents.
President Jordan introduced Dr.
Reynolds, who is a former Stanford
football player, as a man who was
while at "Stanford "in the frdnt ' in
scholarship and In the back part of
the field in football." \ Dr, Reynolds
spoke of the Improvements and
changes at the university since his
day, and in speaking of the Stanford
spirit, which, he stated, was the same
now as in the days of the pioneer
class, he said: "If there is any one
message from the San Francisco
Alumni it is one of sincere, absolute,
unqualified approval. I advise you to
keep in the same course you are go
ing. Continue your work after you
have begun until Stanford will be
known as much by its undergraduate
body aa by its buildings, its architec
ture."
President Jordan gave an interest
ing account of his recent trip East,
touching on his visit to St. Louis,
where he addressed the meetings of
the American Association for the Ad
vancement of Science and the Sigma
Xi scientific fraternity, and his sojourn
at Washington, D. C, where he con
ferred with President Roosevelt with
reference to seal and salmon ques
tions and other topics.
Speaking of President Roosevelt Dr.
Jordan said: "He Is *& man of the
same sort all the way throughâ^you
always know where he stands. The
prinicipal objections to him come from
the people who know where he
stands. (Laughter.) I was asked if
the West did not wish a 'safer' man
as a candidate for President and my
reply was 'no.' I happened to share
my section in the car- coming from
Vew York to Nebraska with. William
Jennings Bryan, and' had politics
talked to me all the way out. I. will
not tell you what I learned." (Laugh
ter.)
President Jordan also mentioned
the meeting called by John W. Foster
to discuss a treaty of arbitration to
be arranged between -England and the
United States. His Idea was that there
should be a high court of arbitration
comprised of lawyers, who should deal
with international disputes in the
same manner that civil causes are,
dealt with under any good legal sys
tem and decide the question after a
careful investigation of facts and evi
dence. â¢-â¢'â¢â¢ â  J â¢. '"â¢"â¢â¢ .' "

BITTER ATTACK
UPON BALFOUR
Liberal Member of House of
Commons Assails the Pre
mier and Joseph Chamberlain

Charges Gross Mismanagement
and Asks If Ministry Is
Fit to Continue in Office
LONDON, Feb. 4.â John Morley an
nounced to-day in the House* of Com
mons hia intention to introduce, on
February 8, his fiscal amendment to
the address in repl>f\to the speech from
the throne, even if Premier Balfour
were< absent. -
Several questions were put with the
object of eliciting information regard
ins the Far Eastern situation, .the
steps taken to avert war and whether
the Government, alone, or in conjunc
tion with the United States Govern
ment, had pressed Russia to evacuate
Manchuria, etc., but the questions
practically were without result.
Earl Percy, Under Secretary of the
Foreign Office, declared that, . in view
of the present state of the negotiations
between' Russia and Japan, it would
be manifestly improper to make any
observations on the situation. The
British Government, he added, had
made frequent representations in re
gard to the delay in the evacuation
of Manchuria..
Earl Percy confirmed the reports
that the Russians had removed sev
eral of the employes of Sir Robert
Hart, the Inspector' General of Cus
toms and Posts in' China, from the na
tive customs office at Newchwang and
had replaced them with Russian nomi
nees. Representations, the Earl added,
had been made on the subject to St.
Petersburg.
Robson (Liberal) moved an amend
ment to the address setting forth that
evidence presented to the war commis
sion disclosed srave mismanagement
and negligence on the part of the Gov
ernment during the South African war.
In a lengthy review of the prepara
tions for the earlier conduct of the
war, Robson severely criticized Premier
Balfour and Former Colonial Secretary
Chamberlain, and at the conclusion of
his remarks asked if Ministers capable
of such conduct were fit to conduct
the affairs of the nation.
j MacNamara (Radical) seconded the
amendment.
Wyndham, Chief Secretary for'Ire

ment. He admitted mistakes had been

Two Meals Daily for Student?.
College students have so long been

"in better health and spirits and better
prepared for hard mental work" when
eating only two meals a day. The col
lege authorities are therefore requested
to cut out one. meal.- The news should
be carried to New Haven, where the
Yale students not only want three rec
tangular meals a day. but have re
cently set up a vulgar howl for "more
pie!" Instead of pie the Yale steward
should try Scotch scones on the boys.

<Cbpyrtsfct. 15X4. by Jowph B. Bowles.)
(NOTEâ This i* the first of i.evtrÂ»l article* by
Mr. d'Arr.alie en the art of singing.)
In the study of the voice one of the
principal ideas to be considered is the
fact that it is a musical instrument.
Therefore or.e should use the same
practical common sense in its develop
ment that one would apply to the me
chanical building of any other Instru
ment. It is difficult to differentiate
the purely physical from the psychical
in voice production, and yet the intel
licent singer must be able to accom-
The vocalist depends upon two great
guiding principles, nar nely. sensation
and hearing. And in the development
of the voice it must become h'.s re
ligion t{^do nothing that violates the
sense of beautiful tone or the feeling
of natunjlnffs in the use of that organ.
Roughly speaking, thr voice may be
divided into three compartments â a trio
of graces: Breath, the control of the
throat and the use of th? resonance
cavities. The greatest of these three
is breath. In fact, a majority of the
faults in voice production may be at
tributed directly to poor breath contra!
And here the same practical principles
guide us which we would use In the
building of a satisfactory bellows for
a wind instrument.
First, for a good bellows, we demand
the power cf taking in a large amount
of air in the shortest possible time;
then the power to hold that air, without
allowing it to escape, and third, the
power to economize as much as pos-
Fib'.e in giving it out. These three
principles GÂ»ve call, first, inspiration;
second, poise; third, expiration.
As to the mechanical act of breathing
much has been written, und discussed.
Proper breathing means natural
breathing, and is as much a means of
health as it is the cardinal principle of
voice production. A prominent phy
cician recently said to me that if he
did not pity my musical ears so much
he would send me at least 150 patients
whose physical condition required prop
er breathing more than medicine.
Now, as to the faults commonly en
countered in the use of breath. First of
all, we are faivAliar with those singers
who when talcing: a breath elevate their
shoulders and chest with great physical
effort and who as a result are always
short of breath. This use of the upper
chest and ' the, shoulders, commonly
known as "clavicular breathing," is
most detrimental to the voice and is
productive of serious faults otherwise.
Then comes the "breathy" tone, where
the air seems to escape over the vocal
chords. And. third, the worst of all the
vocal faults, the deadly tremolo. The
causes for these defects are many, but
the most usual cause is an overloading
of the lungs with breath in the act of
inspiration. In the case of the tremrlo
besides being the result of bad breath
control and a weak diaphragm it may
sometimes be produced by relaxed
muscles in the throat itself.
But now. as to correct breathing. Na
ture has constructed the upper chest
otX of firm bones and cartilagss, which
are more or le,ss unyielding. Below the
chest proper the ribs branch out, thr
breast bone stops and the abdomen,
composed of muscles which are capable
of â¦enslon as,d relaxation, begtrs. Be-
Fldes this the lower lobes cf thÂ° lungs
are more spongelike and capable of ex
pansion and contraction! It is the sing
er's first aim to acquire control of thes?
muscles in deep breathing. This is njt
difficult to do. and the rewards, both
vocally and physically, are very great.
In singing tile singer should elevate
his chest and strive to keep it elevated
always. A good practice is to put both
hand? behind the head and take in
rtowly a full breath without overload
ing the lungs. In contrast to this an
other useful practice is to gasp a breath
and hold it awhile. Again, to take a
long, slow breath through the nostrils,
hold it awhile and expel the air sud
denly. In the act of Inspiration the
greatest care should be taken not to
overload the lungs and not to raise
the shoulder*. The body while taking
the air should be relaxed, and especial
rare should l*Â». taken that the muscles
around the neck and chest are not con
tracted.
Ancrther much neglected point In*
breath control is holding the breath.
By practicing how to maintain the
lungs full of air their elasticity and
strength are much helped. It is useful
for a singer to practice holding his
breath continually. But the great art
of the singer lies principally in know
ing how to give out breath properly.
Taking it for granted that he has taken
Jn the air properly and filled the lower
lobes of his lungs, then comes the
proper emission of breath. The mus
cles of the dlaphfbgm and the ribs
should be so controlled as to quietly
and steadily supply a stream of breath
to the vocal chords. Having reached
the vocal chords, breath turns into tone
and must be properly guided to the va
rious resonance cavities,' such 'as' the
roof of the mouth and the nasal cav"
ity. besides many other auxiliary cham
bers-
â¢ â¢ â¢
.By overcharging the lungs it will be
rapily seen how one loses control of
the muscles and blows out too^much
air for the vocal chords. This will pro
duce frequently cinging off the key*
or a tremolo. An excellent practice for
the control of breath emission if to
take a full breath, hold it a while and
then blow through the teeth quietly
and steadily, producing a sound like
the emission of steam. Another prac
tice is to take a breath and count in
whispers quietly and staccato as many
numbers as possible. Still another good
practice is to take the breath and hum
very quietly, watching the steadiness
of tone and the sensation of having the
hum upon the lips.
Besides this, there are many useful
exercises for the singer, such as hold
ing the chest firm and panting quickly,
taking care that the muscles of the
diaphragm do the work. There is also
a most important practice for the sing
er in getting control of the muscles
of the diaphragm. First take in a
breath and give it out in short puffs.
At each puff let him put his hand just
below the chest and press outward with
thtise musch?s. This has been called a
"lung sweeper." and has a great influ
ence in producing a proper vocal at
tack. '
â¢ â¢ â¢
The physical side c/f breathing is the
great limitation to the singer's art.- It
behooves, therefore, every conscientious
singer to study how best to gain con
trol of breath and to develop its pos
sibilities to the highest perfection. It
is the fc-undation of all good vocal pro
duction, and may either make or mar
frequently his artistic interpretation.
Just as one might build a magnificent
organ witl^an inferior bellows, so the
most splendid vocal mechanism is
valueless and may In time be destroyed
by the failure to breathe properly.
Besides quality of tone the equaliza
tion of vocal registers and the exten
sion of range depend upon a steady
breath supply. Above the purely me
chanical side of voice production, it is
essential for the proper delivery of
musical phrr^cs to have at one's com
mand enough breath to successfully
accomplish the composer's intention.
One is frequently impressed with the
fact that singers, above all classes of
musicians, cut up and mar the beauty
of musical phrases in their failure to
secure a proper breath supply.
Another point in the art of breath
ing properly is to breathe noiselessly
,,ind reposefully. Nothing is more dis
turbing for the" public than to feel the
effort of the vocalist to secure a breath
supply. Such exhibitions show im
proper training on the part of the
singer and will ,;n time impair the
voice. A great blessing to the singer,
preacher or man in public life is the
fact that a full, deep breath does much
toward establishing a mental poise and
giving them a sense of repose before
the public. The healthful effects of
good breathing recommend themselves
.to us when we look over the list of
great singers. The artists of the opera
who visit us yearly are almost as
Splendid physical specimens as one
, woulc care to see.
Tho student of voice will find out
door exercise most valuable, especially
long walks, and he should cultivate
holding his chest high, breathing slow
lythrbugh his nostrils and occasional
ly walking a few paces in one breath.
He will find himself invigorated all
day by a short walk of this kind.
Games and outdoor exercises are all
valuable., provided they are not over
done, and provided further they do
not cause him to use his voice in calls
and cries.- - â *-*â 
Indoor exercises are most valuable,
especially in cold and disagreeable
weather. The best attitude for the
body i* breathing is to lie flat on one's
back with the hands under one's head.
The chest, through this means, is ele
vated and the muscles or the abdomen
are brought into play. Another pop*
for the body during breathing is to
put a stick on the shoulder and hold
it with both hands, thus throwing the
chest out. Still another good practice
is to stand with the back and the heu-J
against the wall and go through the
exercises above mentioned. Besides
the actual act of breathing, there arÂ«s
some good exercises for strengthenin<
the muscles of .the diaphragm. In
general, there is very little danger of
breathing too much, and the student
or voire will find in case of cold or
hoarseness that he will still occupy
himself with his breathing exercises,
which in many cases will be of benefit
to the cold itself. In singing his
songs the student should cultivate the
art of reposefully giving out his
phrases and should try to make his
hearers feei the same sense of an un
limited breath supply.

list two j-Jatforms of the party will be affirmed. He
graciously concedes the right of the coming convention
to make additions, but they must be merely lean-tos,
built against the weatherworn wrecks of 1896 and 1900.
This command of Bryan has been hailed by a roar of
rage from the reorganizes, in which the practiced ear
hears the admission that Bryan has the power to carry
out his plans, and effect his purposes.
He knocked Judg'e Parker out at one blow, and now
with confidence lays down the future law that no man
shall be nominated who t d\d not support the ticket in
both of the last campaigns. That disposes of Olney,
Judge Gray, Cleveland, Governor Francis, Gorman, Mar-,
shall Field, and every one that has been mentioned ex
cept General Miles, William Randolph Hearst and
Brvan himself.
The Iroquois of Chicago â not the theater that was
burned, but the Democratic club that is still burningâ has
dropped Field and taken up General Miles. He has cer
tain elements of eligibility. In 1894, while he was gen
eral of the army, he rebuked President Cleveland for
calling out the troops in the railroad strike. But this
makes him a direct rival of Hearst for union labor sup
port, and Hearst's backers in the South* are already in
the field, reminding the ex-Confederates that Miles put
Jefferson Davis .in irons in Fortress Moqroe, where he
was a prisoner. That affair, with its painful incidents of
the aged prisoner's forlorn fight with his jailers to re
sist the indignity, disposes of Miles, and only Hearst
and Bryan are left in the eligible list.
The only remaining question is, What will they do with
and to each other? Will Mr. Bryan vaccinate Hearst
with his brand of conscience and moral sense, which he
is now advertising as a national antitoxin, warranted
to cure all the evils which are flecking the skin of the
body politic, and present him as the incarnated con
science and moral sense of the United States, warranted
to wash, not to crock, rip or fray and to stand in all
weathers, as an example, domestic and public, of what
the nation ought to be?
There is no doubt that Mr Bryan is expected to do
this, and the party has its eye fixed on the mount of
transfiguration, expecting to soon see the white robes of
Mr. Hearst fluttering on its summit, to be introduced
by Bryan as the national conscience. Those who know
Mr. Hearst well are ready to affirm, from information
gained in his own newspapers, that he is already sub
limated and fit, even without receiving the chrism at the
hands of Bryan. But these admit that a little painting of
the lily will not hurt it. and that the fine gold of Mr.
Hearst's character may be gilded and still not be mis
taken for brass.
The party should be thankful. Its course is marked
out for it, and it needs only to walk humbly therein.
Wherever there is any disposition to side-step Mr.
Hearst will start a newspaper, as an organ of the gospel
according to Bryan, and the platforms of 1896 and 1900
will need only the addition of Hearst himself to make
them political structures superior to Magna Charta and
the Declaration of Independence.
As far as known this is the single new idea that Mr.
Bryan found abroad. It probably came to him while he
was hobnobbing with the immoral monarchs of the Old
World. There must have dawned upon him the vision of
his country's need of a man whose detergent character
would serve as sapolio to scour clean the national
morals, and he said to himself, "Hearst is the sand soap
which in my hands will scrub my country clean."
So we have this combination that is going to clean up
the Temple of Liberty and make it^an abiding place for
virtue.
General Wood, in explanation of an apparent indif
ference, says there are some islands in the Borneo group
that we do not want. Let his opinion thrive to a con
viction. It is a safe wager that we can find a few more
islands in the South Seas that we don't want,, although
they now owe nominal sovereignty to the United States.
And it won't require the services of an exploration
party to discover the fact.
WOLSELEY ON CHINA.
LORD WOLSELEY has ceased to be a notable fig
ure in the world, and China is not supposed to
count for much more than the, spoil of battle in
the approaching conflict between Russia and Japan;
nevertheless the former eminence of Wolseley and the
undoubted possibilities latent in the Chinese race and
empire are sufficient to give interest to the opinions of
the one concerning the probable military development of
the other. The British general passed some time in the
Far East studying the races there,' and came away with a
high degree of admiration for the Chinese and a great
respect, for the part' they may yet be called upon to play
in the politics of the world in the immediate future.
The London Mail has recently published -some ex
tracts from the writings of Lord Wolseley on the sub
ject of China, and prefaced them with/ a note from him,
saying:
"I feel quite confident â knowing from my own experi
ence what, a brave and clever fellow the Chinaman isâ
that were I acorded the necessary, power and given an
absolutely free hand in the Chinese Government, â¢ I
could, in the space of two or three years, provide the
Chinese Empire with an army that would be second to
none in *he world." a
This declaration recalls to mind that in his autobi
ography Lord Wolseley, in commenting upon the possi
bilities of the Chinese, says: -
"There is no nation numerically as great as China
whose customs and modes of life arc so generally com
mon to all parts of their vast empire. *To me they are
the most remarkable race on earth, and I have always
thought and still believe them to be the great coming
rulers of the world. They only want, a Chinese Peter
the Great or Napoleon to make them so. They have
every quality required for the good soldier and the good
sailor, and in my idle speculation upon this world's fu
ture I have long selected them as the combatants on one
side at the great battle of Armageddon, the people ' of
the United States of America being, their opponents."
. That estimate may be nothing more than the specula
tion of an old soldier dreaming on wars' to come, but it
is of at least a passing interest at this time when the na
tions appear, to have, reached the, conclusion that China
is an exhausted empire, fit only to be.the prey of such
strong nations as ; choose to seize upon any part of it.
The speculation" that we' may be called upon to fisrht
the, battle for civilization against an armed and aggres
sive China' is curious, but not devoid of reason. Should
Russia rule China the military control needed to arm,
drill and set her millions marching would be furnished
from St. Petersburg. Perhaps, too, in the not distant
future the successor of Caesar and Napoleon might arise
to use that immense power for the conquest of the
world. It is at any rate an issue quite within the range
of probability, should the Russian establish himself
firmly in Manchuria, and for that reason this specula
tion of Wolseley is not without its valt\e and pertinence
to the news of the day.
Observers of the complicated affairs of Russia and
Japan, shedding a little of their radiant wisdom upon
the situation, gravely announce the expectation that
events will soon move rapidly in the Orient. Most
of us have been laboring under the impression that'
events have already moved so rapidly that it has been
only by the exercise of the most critical diplomacy . by
one or both of the contestants that the crash of war has
been postponed.
IN OUR NAME.
WHILF. the political opposition to protection is
prying out against our "robber tariff," and ask
ing the country to give it a chance to "revise"
protection out of our national policy, other countries are
looking upon our condition with envy and demanding
for themselves the advantages which good policy has
given to us.
Notably is this the case with our nearest neighbor,
Canada, like unto us in institutions and in the genius of
her people. Her resources of soil, stream and forest are
like ours. Over most of her area nature duplicates the
climate of many of our prosperous States, and she pre
sents the same field upon which to exhibit the results
of industrial encouragement.' Under these circumstances
the Canadians desire to develop their country, as we
have ours, and they turn to our example and look upon
our methods, and flatter our industrial policy by de
manding that the Dominion adopt it.
The leading Canadian press keeps standing on the
editorial pages, well head-lined, an address "To the
Government of Canada," asking that it "Give the manu
facturers, workingmen and farmers of Canada the same
kind of tariff as that which has made the United States
the home of the most prosperous manufacturers, work
ingmen and farmers in the world."
It continues: "To the manufacturers of Canada â
Force the Government to give you as good a tariff as
that which has made the American manufacturers rich,
and then pay your Canadian workmen American wages."
"To the workingmen of Canada â Take a leaf out of the
book of American workingmen. Help your employers
to obtain for themselves and for you a Canada-for
Canadians tariff." "To the farmers of Canadaâ Profit by
the experience of the American farmers, the wealthiest
farmers in the world, who support a high tariff and
prosper under it and because of it,"
That is very direct. The classes in Canada to whom it
appeals arc as intelligent as are the people on this side
of the line. They know keenly their domestic condi
tions, as keenly observe ours. They have the same ma
terial resources, a form of government that is as liberal
as ours, industry and genius equal to ours, and yet we ex
ceed them in the volume and general distribution of
prosperity and our rate of progress. They have studied
us and know why this is. They pay no attention to the
free trade doctrinaires who want to revise the vital prin
ciple out of our tariff system. They have the means for
comparison of results. They see themselves lag behind
in manufactures, in wages, in rural development, while
we go forward irresistibly. Therefore this concerted
address demanding tha^: our destiny be duplicated in
theirs, by duplicating the means. All over the Do
minion 'the cry is, "The present affords the opportunity
of a nation's lifetime."
Suppose that some of our free trade doctrinaires go
over and tell them how wrong they are, and see what
sort of hearing will be granted! The Canadians are right
in believing that, given like conditions, like causes pro
duce like effects. They have the like conditions and de
sire that like causes shall touch them into the vigor of
life that they see on 'this side the line. Their movement
is a loud call to the people of the United States, and a
reminder of the final cause of what they have accom
plished.
In testimony recently submitted in a local case an
effort was made to prove that a man was weak-minded
because he clung to a belief that he had a chance of some
day marrying a young and beautiful heiress. This is one
of those affairs where the hopes, if not the rights, of an
individual become the concern of the community.- >; In
this ambitious age of ours many men must be weak
minded.
Russia, it is said, has been playing fast and loose with
the opinions of the world and having taken . her own
good time is now prepared/and ready to fight. There
seems to be much. of the fox in the constitution of this
strange bear of the East. Among all the monarchs, of
the Old World the Czar of Russia more than any other
seems. to. pin his hopes and perhaps his honor to the
morrow. . â¢/: â¢â ;â¢
The final word appears to have been spoken in refer
ence to the Alaskan boundary dispute, over which our
Canadian friends displayed such unseemly petulance!
Lord Lansdovvne says that the islands we gained in
Portland Canal are strategically, worthless. He therefore
is pleased, we will give every assurance that we are,
and the Canadians will have to be.

TALK OF THE TOWN
AND TOPICS OF THE
TIMES
The Persian Cat.
To the truth of this story there stands
ready to attest one Robert Wells of
2546 Hyde street. It is only upon strong
urging that he has consented to allow
the following remarkable circumstance
to appear upon -the authority of his
sworn word.
Near the western crest of Russian
Hill there stands an ancient mansion,
relic of the early sixties. Until the last
few months it was occupied by a cer
tain Mr. Blank, a wealthy Australian
who had come to San Francisco with
his young wife five years ago, and with
her, Robert Wells, his servant and a
Chinese cook he had lived in this old
mansion on Russian Hill In great se
clusion. According to the statement of
Wells, the Australian seemed to be
passionately fond of his wife, a beau
tiful young woman who spoke a for
eign tongue. From her appearance, the
strange ornaments or gold and jade
which she wore and the peculiar stamp
whichwas borne by the letters she re
ceived', Wells conceived her to be an
Indian woman of high caste.
One of the members of this peculiar
household, and the one which came to
play a weirdly terrible part in Its his
tory, was a great Persian cat. the in
separable companion of the woman. So
fond of it was she that she was rarely
without it either sleeping or awake.
A full length oil painting of the mis
tress of the household which had been
brought frcm across the seas incor
porated the great Persian cat in its
rich canvas.
On the 3d of last Novemberâ Wells
remembers the date well â a remark
able thing happened in that old man
sion on the hill. It was foggy and the
bell upon Alcatrazâ that j weird gong
like bellâ was tolling off the spaces of
the night. It was about 11 o'clock.
The lady had retired with her precious
Persian and "Wells had jost entered
the library to carry to his master, sit
ting there, his bedtime toddy, when
there came from the dark hall upstairs
the queer, clicking cough of a cat. It
was repeated again and again in an
incessant" monotone, and then sudden
ly there came a scream, fearful, rasp
ing like the grate of a broken bone.
Wells and his master leaped up the
darkened stairs and into the dimly
lighted bedroom. There, half seated,
half reclining upon a divan, was the
mistress, clad in her night clothes. Her
head, with its great pile of raven black
hair, was bent back upon her shoul
der. Upon the whiteness of her bosom.
Just over the heart, there were the
tiny marks of three t|eth, each with
Its trembling Jet of blood. The woman
was dead.
Crazed into the frenzy of a wild man,
the master seized a pair of iron tongs
from the grate and began to search
the room for the Persian, muttering
meanwhile some words which Wells
took to be Indian. The cat had disap
peared absolutely.
As the master approached that dark
ened portion of the room where hung
the oil portrait of his dead wife, he
suddenly stumbled back with a shriek
of fear and waved frantically to Wells.
The sen-ant approached and the sight
which he saw is what he is willing to
swear to. '
The eves of that Persian in the oil
portrait were lit up by a lambent flame
of green and smoked as if with phos
phorus.
Metcalf Hoaxed.
In the old days, when a lot of law
yers, newspaper men and other good
fellows used to assemble dally for lunch
eon around a huze table in* the back
yard at Barnum's restaurant, Oakland,
there was a. constant effort to "stick"
some member of the party for liquid
refreshments. It was the law of the
table that he who "bit" at a "sell"
must buy. Hon. Victor. H. Metcalf. on
reaching the table a little late one day,
found a number of his companions
humming the air, but not the words,
of a popular tune. This occurred be
fore Mr. Metcalf had been chosen to
represent the Third District in Con
gress and he did not regard It beneath
his dignity to raise his voice (a very
good one, by the way) in merry song,
so yielding to the natural impulse to
join the wordless chorus he caroled
forth in hi3 manly barytone, "O, give
us a drink, bartender!" and then the
crowd howled to the expectant waiter:
"George, Mr. Metcalf wants you to
take the orders!"
Our Panama Bargain.
What has Uncle Sam actually bought
or contracted to buy at Panama? Let
ui take account of the stock. - These
are the items'
Thirty thousand acres of ground at
terminals and along the route.
. Two thousand four hundred and thir
ty-one buildings, including offices,
quarters, storehouses, shops, hospitals
and terminal sheds.
An immense collection of dredges
tugs, barges, excavators, cars, loco
motives and other machinery and ap
pliances, not considered of much pres
ent value.
Work done by the old and the new
French companies, with an estimated
removal of about 36,000,000 cubic yards
of material at a cost of a little more
than J88.600.000.
Maps and drawings, and the records
gathered by the French engineers val
ued at J2.000.000.
The Panama Railway, including
three steamships.
For these several items the second;
or. new, French company is to receive
$40,000,000. Twenty-four millions of
this amount, less obligations, will be
turned over to the old company,
which had spent at the time of Its col
lapse nearly $250,000,000. largely in pro
motion.
The Republic of Panama is to re
ceive immediately -410,000.000, and an
nually after nine years the sum of
$250,000. The United States receives
fron- Panama the grant of a strip of
land five miles wide .upon each side of
(the canal; We- are also to become
sponsors for the continuance of good
order throughout the new republic.
The total excavation yet to be done
is estimated at' about 95,000,000 cubic
yards, not including the work at the
Bohio dam and the Gigante Spillway.
The completion of the canal to a depth
of thirty-six feet from ocean to ocean?
Â«. distance of forty-nine miles, is ex-
pected to cost about $143,000,000. Ves
sels will navigate this channel at a
rate, Including lockage, of four 'miles
per hour. All sailing craft will be
towel not only through the. canal, but
upon the Pacific side for a long dis
tance out to sea.
The aggregated probable tonnage is
placed at about 10,000,000 tons. Of this
business 20 per cent will consist of coal.
To what extent the canal will prove
profitable above the cost of administra
tion, cannot now be stated. The Sues
Canal, under British control, repays its
cost every five years.â Booklovers*

Taft's Plain Duty' .
. A. Maurice Low. writing in the Jan
uary 20 issue of Harper's Weekly, re
calls some interesting reminiscences of
William H. Taft. the new Secretary of
War. Mr. Low tells of the way in
which Judge Taft came to be Governor
of the Philippines, as being a typical
instance of his lofty conception of duty:
"Judge Taft was asked to come to>
Washington. In Washington a con
vers_t!on somewhat like this took place
between Secretary Root and Judge
Taft: 'You are at present on the Cir
cuit bench, where you have a life posi
tion at a fair salary, a dignified and
honorable place, with a pension for
life after you reach the retlrUisr age.
You can count with a reasonable de
gree of hope on being appointed to the
bench of the Supreme Court of the
United States, the ambition of every
lawyer. We want you to go to the
! Philippines. The work is difficult, la
borious, perplexing; there is little that
can be offered you in the way of re
ward, there is much that will be un
pleasantâwhich will you take, the easy
place or the hard one?* " As all the
world knows, he took the bard one.

TAX DEMANDS MAY AVERT
PENDING WAR IN ORIENT
Japan May Be Called Upon to Deplete Her Store
of Gold to Rescue Sakauria From Ruin â Howl
ing Hyena Makes â¢ Ferocious Threats in Court
Perhaps the threatening war cloud
in the Orient will pass away, as a
shadow from a glass, through the In
tervention of Tax Collector Edward J.
Smith. If Japan's attention can be
called to the assistance of one of her
subjects in this city and if proper in- j
terest is taken in his case It will re- j
quire nearly all the contents of the
war chest to square up what is coming
to thP Tax Collector. Without money
Japan cannot possibly go to war.
The citizen in trouble is Omauri Sa
kauria, and he was before Judge Mogan
yesterday. He cor.duc\s a place at
4?3 Dupont street under a permit Issued ;
for a phonograph establishment. The
police complain that under one license
he operates a lifting machine, a muscle |
tester, two punching 1 machines, a j
weighing machine, an electric nerve
tester, a lung tester, one name printer,
tvro machines for measuring the ex
pansion of the chest, four phonograph
machines, thirty-four picture machines,
a whistling machine and a machine
which takes ones picture while one
waits.
Under the ordinance it Is claimed that
he should be compelled to pay S3 a 1
month far each and every one of the
contrivances he maintains ror the be
guilement of nickels from the pockets
of his customers. Space prevents the
computation hastily jotted down by
Judge Mogan regarding the import of
gold Into the city treasury that would
occur if Sakauria should be enforced
to pay license fees for all of the things
that are running in his establishment.
The defendant was present in court |
and wrung his hands. His son also
was present as an interpreter and j
wrung his hands. Bailiff Hickey wrung I
a towel in the washroom about the
same time and a man in the back of
the courtroom broke a rung of a chair.
The scene was pitiable.
The case was continued until to-day
so that the prosecution could secure
the testimony of Tax Collector Smith
as to the amount of the licenses whiqh
Sakauria should be compelled to pay.
George Sterling, the howling hyena,
who threw his breakfast into the face
Of an interviewing reporter, tore up
the warrant for his arrest, fought a
turnkey, threatened to chew the bars
of his cell into iron filings and was
finally subdued by a stream of cold
water in the jail at San Bernardino,
was an interesting figure in Judge Con
lan's court yesterday.
He is wanted in this* city on charges
of robbery and assault with intent to
murder. About two months ago he
entered the bedroom of Frank Evans
en Third street, stuck a revolver barrel
in his victim's mouth and robbed him
of a watch, a revoH'er and $20 in cash.
When he was* arrested by Detective
Ed O'Dea he attempted to kill the po
lice officer with a pistol he grabbed
from Evans' untutored hand.
In court yesterday he confided to
Bailiff Walsh that if he had a couple
of guns he would clean out the court
room and make his escape. The bailiff
said, "Pooh! pooh!" with a couple of
"Fuls!" and told the fighter that a good,
swift punch on the jaw would be com
ing his way if further he "oped the
purple testament of bloody war." The
old, dead days of San Bernardino will
never come again to Sterling until he
has acquitted himself in some manner
from the two charges of felony against
him. They do these things better to
b-a-d men in a large city than can a
town which looks on the desert from
one side and a peaceful agricultural life
from the other.
Joseph Grannucci was sentenced to
six months yesterday by Judge Mogan
on a charge of petty larceny. He is a
recent arival from Italy, and a country
man of his named Joseph Pesa gave
bim a lodging place in his room on
Mason street on the night of January
24. When Pesa awoke the following
morning he found he had been robbed
of a gold chain, a silver watch and a
pistol. The disposition of the a'rticles
was traced to Grannucci and a clear
case waa made.
Judge Cabaniss had before him yes
terday a string of Chinese, which polled
thirty-two in number, who were
charged under a recntly enacted ordi
nance with the crime of barricading their
houses. The ordinance was passed In
order that the police might be facili
tated in their efforts to prevent gam
bling in Chinatown. By it the right of
the Chinese, or anybody else, to lock
their doors by whatever device they
ch<ose was attacked.
George Collins appeared for the de
fendants and intimated that the ques
tion of the constitutionality of the or
dinance would be challenged and car
ried to the Supreme Court of the United
States if necessary. Jridge Cabaniss
was inclined to avoid such uncalled-for
trouble by dismissing the defendants at
one*, but finally took the matter under
advisement until Saturday.
Harry Randall, who also sports the
name of Edward Pererson when occa
sion rails, was held by Judge Conlan
yesterday in bonds of- $3000 on each of
two charges of burglary and assault to
murder. He is accused of having stolen
$5 50 from the cash drawer of a restau
rar.f at SS Seventh street. While trying
to escape with his booty he rapped
Henry Tietjen, the cook, over the head
with an iron bar, inflicting severe in
juries.
*-â '"â  '.â  ..
Four bunrlnrs were held *to answer
J to the Superior Court yesterday by
j Judge Fritz in bonds of $2000 each.
i Three of them, named John McCor
! mick. Edward Cunningham and Rob
ert Martin, are accused of entering
the room of Joseph Platz at 348
Fourth street on the morning of Jan
uary 22. Before they secured much
plunder the sleeper awoke and gave
such a loud alarm that the burglars
ran into the arms of three police of
ficers in their endeavors to escape.

1 burglarizing the room of William J.

: George Lorenzo is the town Con
stable out in the direction of Satro
Heights. He Is employed by the Su
â tro estate to protect Its property, bat
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL/ FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 5. 1904
he has arbitrarily extended his Juris
diction over the" public roadways
thereabouts, the shingle that holds
the ocean in check, the Cliff House
and even the seals that dive and sport
for the amusement of the visitors.
He was before Judge Mogan yes
terday on a charge of battery. The
complaining witness was H. J. Lewis,
a Chinatown guide, whp, in pursuit of
his lawful occupation, escorted a party
from Des Moines, Iowa, to view the
beauties of the ocean beach.
According to the testimony, Loren
zo found the guide on a public road
with hi3 party of tourists and called
him nameless names. Then he tried
to make a bowknot out of a section
of gas pipe by tying it forcibly over
Lewis' head. The crafty guide dock
ed and side-stepped so adroitly that
he escaped serious injury', while the
Des Moines party ran to the ocean's
edge and dipped their tippy-toes in
the surf to scape the wrath of the
town Constable.
Lorenzo told the Judge that his in
structions were to prevent all guides
from showing visitors the beauties of
Sutro Heights, and he really believed
his jurisdiction extended to the road
ways and the beach.
"We have a few stray laws enacted
under the constitution of the United
States," said the Judge, ''which may
possibly conflict with your instruc
tions. Some of them relate to the
rights of a private citizen and others
appertain to the highways. If you can
show me an extraterritorial right
that makes" you a governor and pleni
potentiary on the ocean beach, with
a three-mile sea limit, I shall be glad
to examine it. I will give you until
February 9 to produce the goods and
if you fail I shall certainly find you
guilty of battery."
James Bailey, the cocaine fiend who
escaped from the custody of a police
man Tuesday morning and did a
swallow act around the Morgue build
ing, being finally captured by Deputy
Coroner Jim Murphy, appeared before
Judge Mogan yesterday on charge of
vagrancy.
"You may not be the 'get-away
kid,' " said the Judge, "but you are
certainly a hurdle racer. You remind
me of that fireman in New York who
fell from a twelve-story building, with
rubber boots on, and kept bounding
for five days, until a policeman shot
him to keep him from starving to
death." The crowd in the courtroom
drifted out sadly after this and the
Judge continued the case until Sat
urday.
â¢ â¢ â¢
Arbitration was the keynote of
Judge Mogan's decision yesterday
when Charles Nelson was brought be
fore him on a charge of battery. Nel
son is a walking delegate of the Paint
ers' Union and he was accused of bat
tering the face and figure of J. B.
Thielmans. The scene of the plot is
laid at a new building being erected
at Sixteenth street and Julian avenue.
Thielmans is the superintendent of
construction and had in his employ a
painter who was claimed to be a non
union man. Thielmans was asked
to discharge the doubtful man.
Hhe refused, and during the ar
gument Nelson landed an effective; left
on Thielman's eye. The foreman sent
in a call for the police and a squad
from the Mission station was hurried
in a patrol wagon to the scene of the
trouble. Nelson was the only one ar
rested. â¢
"Hasn't all this difficulty been set
tled satisfactorily to you?" asked the
Judge of the complaining witness.
"Yaas, I tank it ees," said Thielmans.
"Then the case Is dismissed," said the
Judge.
A bench warrant which was issued
for A. G. Schumacher for failure to
appear, by Judge Conlan, Wednesday,
was recalled yesterday on a showing
made by the defendant's bondsman
and his wife. The truth of their
statements was further strengthened
by a doctor's certificate and the testi
mony of Detective Mulcahy that the
defendant was suffering from conges
tion of the lungs and that his appear
ance in court would be suicidal.
Schumacher is accused by Leon
Carrau of obtaining Jewelry to the
amount of about $700 and disposing
of the same without making due re
turn. Technically it Is called felony
embezzlement. Other warrants were
issued one year ago, when the defend
ant was conducting a Jewelry store in
the Palace Hotel building, wherein he
was charged with defrauding his
creditors to an amount approximating
$40,000. All of these charges are un
derstood to have been dismissed, and
the only criminal accusation is the one
now pending in Judge Conlan's court.
Osborne Is Fined.
A. G. Osborne was sentenced by
United States Judge de Haven yes
terday to pay a fine of $500, or in de
fault to be imprisoned until the fine
shall have been paid. Oaborne was
convicted last Wednesday of having
forged a postal money order for $5
at Calistoga- After having been im
prisoned thirty days Osborne may be
released upon taking the "pauper's
oath" as to his inability to pay the
fine.
Wong Din Convicted.
Wong Din was convicted by a Jury
yesterday in the United States Dis
trict Court of having conspired with
John Duffy to land Ma Foo illegally.
He was remanded to the custodv ol

MURDERED MEN
ARE AVENGED
One of Robert Sample's Slay
ers Gets Imprisonment for
Life, the Other Ten Years
JUDGE CHARGES JURY
Joseph 3Iajetti, for Shooting
and Killing Edward Short,
Sentenced to Nine Years
Three defendants who were tried be
fore juries In Judge Lawlor's court on
charges of murder and convicted of
minor offenses were sentenced yester
day. Charles Sullivan was sentenced to
Imprisonment for life in San Quentin
and John H. Powell to serve years
in* Folsom penitentiary. Sullivan was
convicted of murder in the second de
gree for shooting and* killing Special
Officer Robert A. Sample on Folsom
street, between First and Second, on
the morning of August 11, and Powell
was convicted of manslaughter. Each
got the limit.
After Powell's conviction he filed an
affidavit declaring that he fired the
shots at Sample in self-defense and
that Sullivan was not near him at the
time. Sullivan also filed an affidavit
In corroboration of Powell, which was
followed by an affidavit by ex-Bailiff
Mann regarding a statement to that
effect which Powell had made to his
attorneys in his presence. The affi
davits were filed on a motion for a new
trial.
Before passing sentence the Judge
made reference to the affidavits. He
pointed out that Sullivan testified in
his own defense that he and Powell
were abont fifty feet away from Sam
ple wh<yi they heard the shots, and
either Sullivan perjured himself In so
testifying or Powell committed perjury
in the affidavit. It seemed a bold at
tempt to interfere with the administra
tion of justice, shown furthermore by
the circumstances under which th?
former bailiff of the court is supposed
to have overheard Powell's statement.
Whoever fired the shots was guilty. of
a diabolical murder and was lucky in
escaping the severest penalty. Motion
for a new trial was denied.
Joseph Majetti, convicted of man
slaughter, was sentenced to serve nine
years in San Quentin. During a quar
rel with Edward Short, over an opium
pipe and a dog Majetti shot and killed
Short. This was in the Baltimore
House on April 2. The prosecution
agreed to withdraw the prior convic
tions against Majetti and Attorney
Murphy thereupon withdrew his mo
tion for a new triaL Majetti has al
ready spent more than ten months in
the County Jail.

SEEKS IIABEASCORPUSWRIT
Charges That Husband She Is
Separated From Took thf
Child From Her by Force
Habeas corpus proceedings were In
stituted yesterday by Grace V. Tag
gart, wife of Captain Elmore F. Tag
gart, U. S. A., attached to the trans
port Sherman, to recover possession of
her little son Elmore. aged 5 years,
who she claims Is illegally restrained
of his liberty and kept from her by
her husband. She alleges in her peti
tion, signed by Judge Hebbard and
made returnable before him this morn-
Ing, that on Tuesday Ia3t Captain Tag
gart forced his way Into her apart
ments at her hotel, removed the little
boy and took him to the Union Iron
Works, where she says he has ever
since kept him confined in a shed on
the docks. Mrs. Taggart claims that
the boy is in delicate health and in
need of a mother's care and that his
father should be compelled to restore
the child to her care.
The Taggarts have been separated for
more than seven months. The attor
ney for Mrs. Taggart said yesterday
that previously to the separation Cap
tain Taggart had treated his wife with
great cruelty, and that after leaving
her he did not contribute toward the
support of his wife or their two chil
dren. He said further that Mrs. Tag
gart did not want any of her husband's
money, but that she did wish to be
left in undisturbed possession erf her
little ones. Mrs. Taggart was too ill
to be seen yesterday, her troubles hav
ing brought on prostration.
ASSERTS HER HUSBAND
STOLE THEIR CHILDREN
Mrs. Gay Elliott Covey of Stockton
Arrives at Seattle In Quest of Her
Two Young Sons.
SEATTLE, Wash.. Feb. 4.â "I am ;
following my husband, who cruelly left
me in Stockton, California, last fall.
But I am not after him because I want
him to come back to me. It is because
I want my two little boys whom he
has stolen from me. When I *et the
boys he can go where he pleases."
This declaration was made to-dav
by Mrs. Elizabeth Covey, the wife
of Guy Elliott Covey, a big black-'
smith, who lived with his family at
Stockton, and who, according to her
story, disappeared with their two boys,
aged 5 and 3 years, on September 22,
1903.
"If I can find him and the children
I know there is no court in the land 1
that would refuse to give me the chil
dren." said Mrs. Covey.
"Guy Covey will be punished yet. He
has treated" me wrongfully. I know
niy babies want me and I know that
every night the little dears offer ud a
prayer for me. I shall stay in Seattle
until I can learn where Covey Is: then
I shall take steps to have him ar
rested." â  :
Ro**i'Â» Widow Seeks Damages.
Maria Rossi, widow of Antonio
Rossi and administrator of his estate,
sued the Southern Pacific Railroad
Company yesterday for $55,000 dam
ages for her husband's death. He
was run into by a train at Valencia
and Twenty-fifth streets last Septem
ber.
A suit for $S50 damages was also
filed against the railroad company by
the firm of G. Ghiotti Co.. of which
Rossi was a member. The firm de
mands that sum for the death of the
two horses driven by Rossi at the time
of the accident. Both suits are based
on the ground that the train was trav
eling at a speed greater than allowed
by law.

SPORTS OF THE TRACK, THE PRIZERING AND THE FIELD
BRITT CEASES
TRAINING WORK
Practically Abandons His Match
With Young Corbett and Will
Seek Other Engagements
NO ARTICLES SIGNED
Only Document in the*Case Is
the Agreement of the Hayes
Vallev Club to Promote Fight
Jimmy Britt abandoned his training
yesterday and apparently gave up all
idea of fighting Young Corbett in
March. His brother, who manages him,
said they would make other engage
ments.
The Britts and the Hayes Valley
Club managers are of the opinion that
Corbett made a foolish move from a
business standpoint in signing for a
fight prior to the other contest. Toting
Corbett, on the other hand, feels sure
he can pick up 52500 this month and
considers this good wages, especially
in view of the fact that there were
times when he was fighting for $30.
It will give him an added incentive lo
train, something he usually needs
badly and will lure him from the race
track.
There has been no conference be
tween the various parties at interest
and there seems no likelihood of their
heing one. Britt intimates that after
the Corbett-Sullivan fight he will re
open negotiations for a fight with the
winner.
It developed yesterday that when the
<"orbett-Britt match was made the
agreement signed by the parties was
a brief memorandum, in which the
men agreed to fipht and the club to
promote the contest. The forfeits of
the men were put up as an evidence of
srood faith and were to bind more com
plete articles of agreement, which were
to be drawn up subsequently and
These were duly drawn up and were
presented to Young Corbett for his sig
nature. After looking them over he
declined to sign them, as he did not
approve of one clause. This was one
binding the men not to take part in
â  contest prior to the date of the fight.
Since then Corbett has steadily re
fused to sign the paper. Under these
conditions the forfeits of the men mean
nothing and will undoubtedly be re
turned to them.
HAXLOXS I1RST MANAGER
PASSES AWAY IN THE EAST
Iloxer Is One Day Too Ijate to See
Old-Time lYiend in the
Flesh.
Eddie Hanlon. who left here last
Monday en route East, will not have
the expected pleasure of seeing Mike
.^hort, the man who brought him into
prominence, alive. .His ex-manager
succumbed to consumption yesterday
morning. Hanlon will hardly hear
of the death of his friend until he
reaches Short's home in Pittsburg to
day. . â 
Before Hanlon fought Young Cor
bett it was reported that Short had
succumbed, but this was corrected
later on. It will be some small conso
lation to the Calif ornian to be able to
pay a last tribute of respect to his
old friend.
No Action on March Boxing Permit.
â¢ The Supervisors Police. Committee
postponed action yesterday for one
week on the petition of the Hayes Val
ley. Sunset, and Pacific Athletic clubs
for a permit to give a professional
boxine exhibition in March.
The Shasta Athletic Club, by H. L.
Fortreide of 26 "Drumm street, has
petitioned the Supervisors for a per

organizations which want to promote
professional contest*.

CHUB DEFEATS
FORTUNATUS
Comes on Strongly in the Last
Sixteenth and Wins Handily
at the Ascot Park Track
TALENT MEETS REBUFF
Establishes Redan, the Artil
lery Geldi/r^, Warm Favorite
and Sees Him Lose to Ocvrhe
LOS ANGELES, Feb. 4.â Favorites
had an unfortunate time of it at Ascot
to-day, Stemwinder being the only one
to lead the field at the finish. The other
five races went either to second or third
choices excepting the first* which was
won by Flourish at_ odds as good as 10
to 1. It was ladies' day, and despite
the cloudy, threatening weather there
was an attendance of 4000, and the
twelve books were never lacking for
something to do.
The best race of the day was the
fifth, at a mile and a quarter, with five
starters. Fortunatus was held steadily
at evens, with Chub at 2 to 1 and Dia
mante at 4 to 1. Platonius and John
McGurk were 8 and 12, respectively.
Fortunatus held the lead most of the
route, but Chub came on and won
handily* in the last sixteenth. Platonius
was third.
Flourish. Laocoon and Dr. Bernays
finished in the order named in the first
race, at one mile. Laocoon was a strong
favorite!
The second race was a three-horse af
fair â Stemwinder, The Fog and Ameri
cano. Stemwinder, at 4 to 5, won all
the way from Americano.
Corrigan's Ben Heywood won the
third number from Huapala, and the
owner of the latter horse ran the win
ner up to JTOO. $400 above his entered
selling price. The customary $5 retained
Heywood for Corrigan. Fox Lake, the
favorite, was third in this race.
Mainspring was plunged on by the
talent to win the fourth race, but fin
ished third. El Fonse won and Iras
took the place.
The last race of the das r was an upset
for the talent. Redan was the red-hot
favorite, with Dolly Hayman at twos
and Tower of Candles at 4. Ocyrhe went
to the front and won by two lengths
from Hayman, Redan third. Ocyrhe
was C to 1.
Among the prominent visitors at As
cot to-day were S. S. Howland, princi
pal owner of Bennings track, at Wash
ington, D. C, and of Kenilworth track
at Buffalo; James Howard, secretary
of Washington Park track, Chicago,
and Captain W. M. May of Lexington,

THE SAN FRANCISCO. CALL, FRIDAY. . FEBRUARY 5. 1904
JUDGE RUNS A MILD RACE
AND FORMASTER WINS EASILY
Four Choices Are
Defeated at
â¦* â¢ Ingleside.
Rain fell at intermittent spells* and
the course at Ingleside yesterday was
almost sloppy enough for boat-racing.
In fact, the race won b'y Formaster
looked like a national sculling cham
pionship contest. The Boots & Holien
beck three-year-old is a useful piece of
horseflesh and for that reason was as
signed 112 pounds in the six and a half
furlong handicap. Long Shot was In at
the same weight, and The Mighty with
a couple of pounds less. Formaster
went to the post at 8 to 5, with Bull
man In the saddle. Long Shot, Ananias
and Solanus were the early pace setters.
At the head of the stretch Bullman got
through on the rail and at the close
downed Judge without difficulty. The
latter colt lay so far out of it early in
the game that it looked as if he might
have broken down. Otto Wonderly on
The Mighty, a fast breaker, got away
from the post poorly, of course, losing
the show to Solanus.
TWO FAVORITES SCORE.
Besides Formaster the only other
winning favorite was Brennus, and
Steve Judge's gelding was a tame one.
Considering the unpleasant climatic
conditions the attendance was good.
Oliphant may be a good handler of
long shots, but when seated on a fa
vorite Sidney Bender's apprentice can
without effort ride a dreamy, drowsy,
languid race. He had the mount in
the opening seven-furlong event on Op
timo and succeeded in finishing third.
"Medicine Man" Hildebrand broke
away in the lead with Constellator and
won all the way, galloping* by the
judges nearly three lengths ahead of
El Piloto.
Barney Schreiber's Speaker Fontana
was sent to the post favorite over Bill
Short for the kindergarten scramble,
but cojild not deliver. Johnny Daly,
who rode Bill Short, got Al Dobson's
youngster away in front and, holding
Speaker Fontana's measure through
out, beat the latter by two lengths at
the wire. Eduardo, from the Burns &
Waterhouse stable, finished an indiffer
ent third.
In the mile and fifty-yard selling
event Bill Massie, ridden by Hilde
brand, showed surprising improvement
over his previous race. Figuring on
the race mentioned. Pierce J looked a
good thing for the race yesterday! and
waÂ« accordingly played down to 6 to 5
favoritism. Â«
PIERCE J IS PACEMAKER.
Larsen had the mount on Pierce J
and cut out the pace for about seven
eighths of a mile. Then Hildebrand sat
down on his mount and Bill Massie
simply rolled home first. . G. \V. Tra
hern ran third behind the favorite.
Oliphant distinguished himself
again in the five and a half furlong
sprint, for which selection Rustic
Girl, Glendenning, The Pride, Aunt
Polly, Titus and Fort Wayne declined
the issue. This made Lady Bimbo
look the most eligible of those left in
and the filly opened a 3 to 1 "chance.
Despite the play on her the odds re
ceded to 4, the most play being '.on
Brennus, -which was backed from 6 to
4. Brennus won galloping from
Flyer, with Goddess of Night third.
Oliphant got left at the post almost
with Lady Bimbo and was never in
the running.
Scherzo opened equal favorite with
Creole Jim for the final mile selling
run. In a previous race Scherzo had
shown a dislike for sloppy going and
Tommy Burns was fortunate to finish
third. By a close turn into the
stretch Hildebrand on Bombardier
shook off the bunch and at the wire
finished more than three lengths In
front of Creole Jim, the post favorite.
NOTES OF THE TRACK.
The stable of Charley. McCafferty
was restored to good standing by the
stewards yesterday.
. For assaulting H. Magill in the pad
deck on Wednesday, 1 Hiram Pierce
was suspended and denied all privi
leges of the track until May 1 by the
stewards.
Schwalbe pulled -up lame yesterday
morning after a workout, and Barney
Schreiber said his mare would not
go to the post, for the Burns handi
cap to-morrow. ...
Sacredus, from the Jennings stable,
is a shifty mudlark and will undoubt
edly be a starter in the *big race Â±o
morrow. His weight is 100 pounds,
and Charley Corinell has the mount. -
Mike Daly welcomed the downpour
of rain as the maiden lady does leap
year. Claude is a notorious mudlark
and had he not. lost a plate might
have captured "the Burns" last year.
Hildebrand rode three winners. Joe
Teager'8 lightweight had * but four
mounts, which makes the feat a very
creditable one. Â» /

YOUNG GRAYSON MAY
SOON GAIN FREEDOM
Father of Check Passer Relents and
Telegraphs Friends to Assist Son ./
Out of Trouble.
Temple Grayson, the gay young
man from Portland, who now occupies
a cell in the City Prison, awaiting a
hearing on a charge of having issued
spurious checks, is likely soon to re
gain his freedom. Yesterday his
father, Colonel James . T. Grayson,
who, several days ago, announced
that he had disinherited his son and
would have nothing further to do with
him, telegraphed to a number ' of
his friends in this city to do what they
can for his wayward boy and help
him out of jail. Apparently the fath
er has relented, as he has done be
fore. Friends are now endeavoring
to settle with the vari<Tus persons who
were duped by young Grayaon and
thus stay the prosecution " of the
charge, and of other like ones. An
aunt of the young man is also report
ed, to have interested herself in his
behalf and has promised^to make good
the amounts of money he owes in the
event of the father failing to do so.
Killed by Gas.
James Sherman, a sailmaker, 59 years
of age, was asphyxiated ln^a lodging
house at 334 Bush street ' yesterday
morning, and Vincent McDonald, sec
ond, mate of the Olive Bank, narrowly
escaped death in the same manner. The
men went to bed at about 3:30 yester
day morning in an Intoxicated condi
tion. A few hours later Thomas Fer
guson, one of the proprietors of the
place, smelled gas -in the hallway. He
opened the door of the room and found
Sherman dead in bed and McDonald
unconscious on the floor. McDonald
was taken to the Harbor Receiving
Hospital, where he was revived. Later
he was taken to St. Thomas'. Hospital.

DR. MICHAEL LA FERE . V
ENDS niS EXISTENCE
Kills Himself Because a Woman
-Leaves Him for Another
Man.
,-Dr. Michael La Fere. 40 years of
age, committed suicide yesterday
morning in his room at a lodging
house at 117 Eddy street, death evi
dently being caused by poison. La
Fere was found undressed, his head
resting on the floor and his feet on
the side of the bed. r %'t*
On a chair near the bed were
two glasses and a number of brief
notes written by La Fere before he
ended his life. The notes were as
follows: "To the Coronerâ Please
do not dissect my body. M. La Fere "
"I wish she will be happy, my dying
wish." "I promised to be here In the
morning; I am here." "I, W i sh to
leave something after me- never trust
a woman."
The reason that La Fere committed
suicide is supposed to have been be
cause his consort. Mrs. Jennie Little,
had decided to end their relations.
A note written by La Fere was
found by Mrs. Little in her purse, but
she could not say how the note was
placed there or when. The note was
in La Fere's handwriting and said:
,"The bearer is not responsible for my
death." Mrs. Little thinks that La
Fere placed the note in her purse
while she was visiting his. room on
Wednesday night.
La Fere came to California from
Sweden two years ago and found a
position with the North Alaska Sal
mon Company as a physician at ; the
company's fishing grounds.
Superintendent C. T. Hale of the
North Alaska Salmon Company was
surprised' to hedr yesterday of La
Fere's death. Hale stated that La
Fere had given every satisfaction and
was re-engaged as a doctor _for the
coming season. La Fere had in
formed Hale that he was residing with
his wife at the lodging-house' at 117
f Kddy street. /
A bottle of corrosive sublimate was
found in La Fere's room and. it is
thought that he used the deadly
poison. / .

RELIABLE INFORMATION' v ' 'â -
FOR INCOMING ALIENS
California Promotion Committee
Forms Plans to Supply Facts to
New Arrivals.
To attract attention of desirable im
migrants to this State the California
Promotion Committee has communi
cated with the Bureau of Immigration
of the Department of Commerce sug
gesting the establishment of bureaus
of information at the principal immi
gration stations for the benefit of ar
riving aliens. Commissioner General
W. P. Sargent of the Bureau of Immi
gration has written the following to
the Promotion Committee:
Slnc*<5 assuming the duties of Commissioner
General of Immigration and becoming ac
quainted with the conditions of the cervlee
I have realized the need of reliable information
being accessible to arriving aliens In regard
to conditions in different sections of the coun
try, especially where Immigration Is desired.
Of course it will be necessary for CongresS tr.
take action before such a plan could be put
into operation. My idea Is that a opace suf
ficiently* large be assigned for the purpose
of placing on exhibition sampler of the prod
ucts ot the several States, as well as giving
to the aliens all available information as to
rents, cost of land, etc. This Is not Intended
to In any way encourage Immigration, but
rather as a means of more evenly distributing
the largp number who annually come to the
United States.
Rufus P. Jennings reports that the
Promotion Committee will work un
til the bureaus are established.
Marsh Shootln?.
One sad feature of marsh shooting is
the destruction J of herons and the
larger . marsh birds. Only a rigid ad
herence to decency of conduct can pre
vent that, for. it is after all sometimes
a temptation on a blank day. But It is
wrong, all wrong, and unless a man
sticks to the principle that nothing ex
cept a game bird is excuse for shoot
ing our marshes will lose some of
their most picturesque and beautiful
inhabitants. I know that anglers
howl intermittently for the ex
termination of all heron, cranes
and kingfishers; I know also
what damage the latter birds do, and
also certain species of heron, . such as
the little green heron. Yet I have no
desire to drive out these feathered fel
low-flshermenâno wish to fish In soli
tary hoggish comfort. Where herons
and kingfishers become too numerous
there Is no reason why their numbers
should not be thinned out. But as for
a wild and general fusillade upon the
appearance of these birds, it is brutal
and needless and a policy which never
can appeal to me.â Baltimore American.

has already arrived.

"LADIES' NIGHT"
A BIG SUCCESS
Varied Programme Is Rendered
at the Olympic Club in
Honor r of the Gentler Sex
LARGE CROWD PRESENT
Boxing, Wrestling and Vocal
and Instrumental Selections
Entertain the Audience
The popular ''ladies* night" enter
tainment at the Olympic Club last
night brought out. a , crowd that
thronged the large gymnasium. The
programme was one c* exceptional
merit and the fair ones who were at
tracted to the home of the athlete had
a chance to divert their thoughts from
knockout punches and half .Nelsons
while the musical portion of the pro
gramme was being rendered.
Sam Berger and Harry Chester, the
heavy-weight boxers cf the club, fur
nished the main attraction in the man
ly art line. The big fellows went three
lively rounds, and the way they de
livered Imaginary finishing blows and
ducked and sidestepped wicked swings
for the jaw all seemed to amuse and
please the ladies In attendance.
The Lundle brothersâ Bob and Joe-7
did a three-round stunt with the mitts,
which w.as full- of life and action. The
tiny Rittler brothers and Steve Mc-
Xally brought forth rounds of aj>plausÂ«
with their tumbling work on the mat.
Richard Hunt, the tenor, favored the
audience with several selections. Maude
Amber sang "Bedelia" in her own clev
er way and made a great hit with
those in attendance. She was presented
with a beautiful bouquet of pink roses
as she left the stage.
Charles Jenkins, George Hensley, B.
Riordan and -M. Veckl furnished the
wrestling attraction of the night. They
showed how the strangle hold Is ex
ecuted, and also all the other tricks
peculiar to the game. Charles Slngler
and Adclph Hanlon did some difficult
work on the Roman rings.
The Misses Pasmore won rounds of
hearty applause with their musical se
lections. One played the cello, the other
the violin, while the third performed
on the piano. George BorneHian and
William Sieberst did the comical part
of the show to perfection when they
appeared in their short sketch entitled
"Paderewski and His German Friend."
Seed Is Nature's Gem.
In nature's great treasure house the
seed is the one priceless gem. Com
pared to it the great deposits of con!.
the mines of silver and gold and of
diamonds and precious stones are as
nothing. Man counts his wealth in
dollars and cents, in mining and rail
road shares, and in houses and lands;
while his primal necessities are limit
ed to food and clothing. Without
these all other tokens of affluence are
void. These indeed are the sources of
true wealth, and the grass of the field
supplies them all directly or Indi
rectly.
The cereal grains â wheat, rye, oata,
barley, rice and Indian corn â which
are the seeds of true grasses, are con
vertible directly into food. The suc
culent leaves and culm of the wild
grasses furnish sustenance to mil
lions of cattle, sheep and goats, and
are transformed by them Into
flesh, milk, wool and hides; thus In
directly providing meat and clothing.
They also protect the soil from flood
and drought and landslide. Sendinx
"their fibrous roots down among Uv?
shifting sands of the seashore, they
bind the unstable particles into a mass
so dense as to check the erosion of
the waves. Thus grass, the synonym
of frailty, is able to raise Its tiny green
scepter against the destructive power
of the elements. â Outing.
Moving a Lighthouse 1 .
The Government is engaged in a
novel undertaking at Benton Harbor.
Mich. The lighthouse has been set on
rollers and is being moved about 1000
feet in the lake. The work was occa
sioned by the extension of the main
pier 1000 feet Into Lake Michigan, and
the lighthouse will be moved out to the
end of the pier, providing It does not
topple over and slide into the lake.
When in position it will be possible
to see the range lights from fifty to
one hundred miles along the Michigan
Shore. â Indianapolis News.

Newspaper work in Russia Is a
pleasant sort of life, and the Govern
ment spends more money on its press
censors than on its schools. Last year
eighty-three papers were suspended for
various periods, and twenty-six were
forbidden to accept all advertisements,
â while 259 editors were told they could
have a short vacation in Siberia if they
continued their methods of revivinjc

Health Board Committee Files
Report on Alleged Shortage in
Funds of the ' Almshouse
The special committee of the Health
Board, consisting of Drs. Poheim, Har
vey and Hughes, appointed to investi
gate the accounts of ex-Superintendent
Kelly of '.he Almshouse, filea a report
at yesterday's meeting of the board,
and as a result the books of the in
stitution will be exDerted.
'The committee finds after investiga
tion that "carelessness or worse seems
to have controlled the system of ac
counts of the institution." The report
continues:
In general the books are in such a state
that only an expert will be able to unravel
the mistakes and confusion. The superin
tendent has a letter on hand from Attendant
J. Cuddy, in which it if stated that Inmate
James Murphy demanded >-2 which Mr. Cuddy
paid over to Mr. Kelly for him and which
Mr. Kelly un two occasions promised to pay
later, hut as yet Mr. Murphy l.as not re
ceived his money. On the books of the in
mates' account*, and nowhere else. Is there
any account whatever of this transaction.
MIST EXPERT BOOKS.
It Is the opinion of this committee that only
a thorough exporting of the bocks will
straighten out the Almshouse accounts. We
recommend a thorough going over of ths
financial accounts of this institution.
Incidentally, your eorrmitte* has discovered
many other circumstances and conditions
whlÂ«"h under proper reulatlor.s Fhoirfd ' not
prevail at any municipal Institution and on
these matters your committee will report
hereafter.
The apparent shortage of $72 of the
moneys tx-longing to an incompetent
inmate, Mary O'Neil. was made up by
Mrs. Kelly, who deposited the money
with Superintendent Schmitz. who ac
cepted it, without, however, the official
sanction of the committee.
The next item taken up wag the Hearst
fund, consisting of a. yearly donation of $250
to be used for the benefit of the inmates of
the Almshouse.
When ex-Assi?tant Secretary Cameron was
a?kÂ«-<i to explain the apparent discrepancies In
the Hearst fund he protested that the board
had no Jurisdiction o\-er the ?ame, holding
that Kelly had a right to expend the money
at pleasure, without accounting to anybody, !
In spite of the fact that a partial accounting ;
had already tx-en attempted on turning over
the keys to the new euperintendent. and In
face of* the fact that the last check had been
made out to the City and County AlmÂ«house.
NO i:iX'i:iPTS FOR MONEY.
Your committee find that the rule has been
not to give receipts for money turned over by
the Inmates to th<? superintendent for safe
keeping. The superintendent simply marked
it down In his own book. The chief clerk also
had a l>ook In whlrh the same was done. On
comparison of these books we find that many
of the accounts do not agree, as for example,
the account of Jane McOown. The superin
tendent has been unable to find any receipts
for money claimed to have been paid back to
the inmates. There are many accounts ap
parentlv closed, according to the books, but
nÂ» receipts on file showing that any one has
received the money on inmates' account.
The Health Board complied with the
order of the Civil Service Commission
by restoring Edward Coffey to his po
sition as clerk from which he was re
moved. Percy Hennessy, who was re
tained at the time, and stands lower
on the iligible list than Coffey, was re
moved to make ropm for Coffey, though
his efficiency is recognized by the
board. Coffee's salary was fixed at
$100 per month. He formerly received
$150.
PAY OF NURSES.
The board rescinded its former action
fixing the salaries of nurÂ«es in training
at the City Hospital at $9 per month.
1 The new schedule fixes the freshmen's
class at $8. juniors $10 and seniors $12
per month.
C. M. Cooper, M. D., was appointed tf.
! the City Hospital as visiting physician,
to have charge of the X-ray and electro
therapeutic department, without pay.
The receiving secretary at the City
Hospital was ordered to make a diag
nosis of ail cases of applicants for ad
mission to the hospital. The secretary
shall be a physician in good standing.
' This rule will prevent the restoration of
former secretary Wolf to the position.
The complaint of E. Hintz, superin
tendent of the French Cemetery, that
Cemetery Inspector Walsh jvas infring
ing on his rights in the exhuming of
bodies was referred to the health officer.

The appalling tragedy recently enarfed at
the Iroijuole Theater conflagration In our sister
city of Chicago jrnt a thrill of horror through
out the civilized world; and
Subsequent investigation by the municipal

tributed to the gross neglect of the managers
of the theater in question in observing the
municipal ordinances governing the construc
tion and management of public buildings; and
The Board of Education of San Francisco
contemplates with horror the dangers that
might ensue in thc event of fire in one of our
Fohools, and mindful of their responsiblllty.

City Attorney Long advised the Po

CHAN'S YOUNG
WIFE UNHAPPY
Appeals to Court to Annul
the Bonds Uniting Her to
Young Chinese Native Son
Grace Catherine Chan Ah On, a Chi
nese girl who in March of last year
became the wife of Chan Ah On, a
young Chinese Native Son, has tired
of life as a matron and wants the bonds
annulled. She filed a suit for that
purpose yesterday, alleging as cause of
action that when she became his wife
she was only 17 years of age, and did
so without the consent of her parents
or guardian. She charges that, though
her husband well knew because of his
birth here that a marriage to a minor
was illegal, he kept the knowledge from
her and by falsely representing to her
that there was no obstacle to their
union prevailed upon her to become his
bride.
Marguerite Dickinson Booker, who
was married to Ernest F. Booker at Ju
neau, Alaska, in 1889, has sued for a
divorce on the ground of desertion. She
charges that Booker left her three
months after their marriage. Intem
perance is alleged in the complaint for
divorce filed by Giuseppa Protomastro
against Mary Protomastro, and in the
action commenced by J. J. Taylor
against O. M. Taylor desertion is
charged.
Attorney J. H. Meredith yesterday
filed notice that he would represent
James C. Dunphy in the divorce pro
ceedings brought against him by Edith
Dunphy.
The suit for divorce of Trinlta C.
Brewer against W. W. Brewer was
partially heard by Judge Murasky yes
terday and continued until the 18th.
The plaintiff and defendant are New
York stage people. Mrs., Brewer, be
fore leaving here for New York, Insti
tuted the suit on the ground of deser
tion.
Judge Hebbard granted Viola Rodg
ers an interlocutory decree of divorce
from Joseph J. Rodgers. The suit was
Instituted by Rodgers, but he did not
prove his charge that she spent too
much time running about with other
men. Mrs. Rodgers, however, fur
nished ample evidence that Rodgers
has deserted her, as she charged in
her cross complaint.
Divorces for desertion were also
granted to Richard S. Northey J from
Anita Northey, Kate C. Bailey from
John J. Bailqy and A. B. Saunders
from M. B. Saunders.
Mayor Means to Fight.
The officials of the- Humane Society
received word yesterday from Secre
tary George Keane that Mayor
Schmitz would not approve the bond
of Charles Holbrook as Poundmaster.
The reasons given are that the office
was not vacant and that the charter
does not allow the appointment of a
society to any position. The Humane
Society people are undecided just
what steps to take to secure the place
to which they have been formally ap
pointed by the Board of Supervisors.
Irwin still claims to be Poundmaster.
Involuntary Insolvency.
Hooper & Jennings, Levi Strauss &
Co. and the Dunham, Carrigan & Hay
Â«ien Company filed a petitio'n yester
day in the United States District
Court to declare the Coos Bay Mill and
Lumber Company an involuntary
bankrupt. It is alleged that that com
pany on January 30 last committed

ASK CONGRESS
FOR MAIL TUBE
Commercial Bodies of City Ask
for Better Mail Transmission
Through Business Section
Resolutions have been adopted by all
the commercial organizations of the
cfty urging the adoption of the pneu
matic tube service for mail delivery in
San Francisco. A copy of the resolu
tions has been sent to each of the Cali
fornia Senators and Representatives in
Congress. The signers of the resolu
tions for the organizations are: Presi
dent Frank J. Symmes of the Mer
chants' Association, President George
A. Newhall of the San Francisco
Chamber of Commerce. President A. A.
Watkins of the San Francisco Board
of Trade, Vice President E. W. Hop
kins of the Merchants' Exchange and
President N. P. Chipman and Manager
Arthur R. Briggs of the State Board
of Trade.
In addition to these signatures Post
master Fisk added at the bottom of the
page bearing the resolutions the fol
lowing over his name: "The installa
tion of this system will undoubtedly
furnish a quick and reliable means of
mail transportation."
The resolutions are preceded by a
preamble, in which reference is made,
to the fact that a commission appoint
ed by the Postmaster General has made
recommendations for a pneumatic tube
service for the transmission of mails
after taking into consideration the bus
iness of eleven cities, including San
Francisco. The essential part of the
recommendation contained in the reso
lutions is in a repetition of the report
of a special commission relative to the
tube service in San Francisco as fol
lows:
Th* situation is therefore most opportune
for the Inauguration of a pneumatic tube ser
vice on Mission street Irom the. new gen
eral Fostofflce. via Station K, to Station D
and the railroads at Market-street ferry â a.
distance of 1.5Â© miles â and on Third street to
Station E and the trains at the Tbird and
Townsenrt street depot. The latter line can
be provided for from Station K,- the Interme
diate station on the main route from the gen
eral Postofflce to Station D, which Is now Jo
cated on New Montgomery street, near Mis
ylon. but on which a change in location to
Mission streÂ«t in that \-iclnlty is under con
sideration, and the distance on that line will
bo about one ml^ The two lines of tubes),
involving 2.50 miles, are recommended. It be
ing jur belief that its introduction will pro
vide a quick and reliable mail service between
the points named, which is actually demanded
by present conditions, and which are certain
to become more pressing in the- near future.
An appropriation for the tube service
In this city is urged upon Congress at
?ts present session.
threatens the life
of jasper . McDonald
Former Park Commissioner Swears
Out a Warrant for the Arrest of
William J. Bell.
Jasper McDonald, ex-chairman of
the Democratic County Committee
and ex-Park Commissioner, swore to
a complaint before Police Judge Caba
niss ' yesterday charging William J.
Bell with threats against life. The
warrant was handed to Detectives
O'Dea and Mulcahy, who began a
search for Bell.
Bell was employed as a painter in
Golden Gate Park and was discharged
while McDonald was a Park Com
missioner. About four months ago
Bell met McDonald on Market street,
and after asking .him if he could give
him a job at painting some of his
houses suddenly called McDonald vile
names, and said he would meet him in
the Western Addition some night and
cut his throat from ear to ear.
McDonald paid no attention to
Bell's threat, but when he met Bell
at Montgomery and Bush streets on
Wednesday afternoon and Bell made
the same threat he telephoned to Cap
tain Martin and was advised to swear
out the warrant for Bell's arrest. Mc-
Donald says he is a/raid Bell will
harm him. The painter believes Mc-
Donald was the cause of his discharge
from the park.
Palm Loses on ApncnJ.
The Supreme Court decided yester
day that Jennie M. Heaton was en

MOKELUMNE HILL, Feb. 4.â In the
Kaiser and Magulre mine <>n French
Hill, a suburb of this town, prospectors
found a four-ounce nugget o* gold.
To this chispa, particies of quartz, ad

of quartz of fabulous richness must

This mlrle is contiguous to the old
placer mine which made Mokelumne
Hill famous in the early history of
California, when gold was carried into
town by the panful. This snot unrii
recently was covered by thick trees
and consequently escaped exploration
by prospectors. .
In a single pan at the Stockton Hill

CONDITION OF TRADE.
The Situation From a Banker's
Point of View.
The New York circular of Henry Clews eaye:
â "Clique operations infused a fair degree. of
activity on the Stock Exchange. Of strong
and substantial leadership there are few signs;
>*t it Is quite apparent that the heavy buy
er* who took stocks during the liquidation of
15O2 have bern holding for better figures, and
ilÂ«t to this extent at least thÂ»v were working
In harmony with the lesser cliques. The re
cent advance, however, was sufficient to in
duce profit-taking at the first signs of weak
ness, and this explained the reaction which
followed in the latter part of the week.
"A powerful leverage was available In the.
crest abundance of money offered on call on
Â«>a*y terms which makes 5 per cent stock look
fairly eh*np at present figure*; Â«f>peeially in
view of the uronrer foundation resulting from
\+*i liquidation. It is quite- evident that these
are the two principal factors in the market
at prtsent. and It is premature to assume that
their force has yet been expended. No doubt
Â«e should see a much stronger market were
it not for the probability of war in the Far
na*t. the chances of an unfavorable Northern
Securities derision anÂ«l the deterrent effect c.l
an approaching Presidential campaign. These
Â«-Â©nsideratlons wen quite sufficient to hold
speculation within safe limits; for disturbing
developments in any of these uncertainties
*ould pr^-lpltate more or less reaction. The
cotton speculation Is also a disquieting fea
ture, as it not only deranges trade in the
staple buV seriously affects manufacturers and
distributors of cotton goods.
GENERAL CONDITIONS.
"The condition of the country, es a whole. '
is both satiefactcry and sound. Our farming
classes are exceptionally prosperous, because
demand generally >ac overtaken supply. High
price* are being obtained for nearly all agri
cultural product*, and the situation Is such
that the American farmer seems assured of
another prosperous year. As for our indus
trial classes the? are certainly better off than
Â«-ver in their history. The only difficulty
hetf is that wages have risen to an almost
prohibitive point, and enterprise la consequent
ly checked until necessary concessions are
made; concessions which would mean no hard
ship to labor but Elmnly diminish the number
of unemployed. Among the mercantile classes
the situation is exceptionally sound. In this
<juartw there has been little overtrading, and
our merchants, as a class, have been singu
larly conservative acd fortunate In avoiding
too rapid expansion. Of course they have
been highly favored by the wonderful growth
rf the country in population and resourcee:
nevertheless the comparative absence of the
cpeculatlve ppirit among our trading classes
has been a wholesome and encouraging feature.
THE MANUFACTURING SITUATION.
"When we come to. the manufacturing situ
ation we tcuch the weakest spot in the nation.
Our great industrial combinations may be the
fÂ»st ever made to do the world's work; but
th*y have been seriously handicapped at the
nart by the financial abuses which are too
:amillar to even" one. In many cases they are
100 big ar.a cumbersome to adjust themselves
readily to ohanping condition*-, and in nearly
all' cases they are so weighted down with
watered securities as to make their future
â till the most #friou* financial problem of the
futurr. Some day the readjustment here must
be made more complete; but that contingency
will probably be postponed to a later date
-hr.-uH tnÂ» country continue otherwise pros
perous, and in all probability will then come
*o gradually as to avoid shock or panic.
Further, (t mÂ»Â«t not be forgotten that, as said
above, the vituatinn in this respect has been
immensely rtrenglhrned by the forced liqui
dation of I&03. which effectually removed many
cf the weakest *pots.
STOCKS AND BONDS.
"Theie has teen a surprisingly rood demand
for bonds, and many of the recent new issues
have been readily taken. Our railroads show
a disposition to go flow in their improvements,
owing chiefly to the unsettled condition of
thÂ»> Iron and Â«te<;I markets. As steel comes
down, hewever. to a more normal level orders
are likely to Increase and the railroads will
no doubt continue their outlays. At a later
period, therefore, it would cause no surprise
if tbelr demands upon thÂ« money market were
to expand. The effect of war would unques-
Tlonably be temiorarily depressing, because of
thÂ«* rtraln which any new war loans would
impose upon the international money market*.
American eheres In common with others would
be sold to provide funds. The decline, how
ncr. would not bÂ» serious, and might as usual
be discounted in advance. Just now the Pres
idential compaign does not cut much of a
figure. This is probably explained by the be
lief that a revival of the issues of the last
two campaigns is impossible, and that In com
parison with them it will be a quiet affair.
"The general outlook for the market is con
*eÂ«ruently favorable. There are some lm
poitant uncertainties, however, and prices have
already had an important recovery: Â» that
unfavorable developments might easily precipi
tate sharp reactions. This means a pood
trading market and a profit onvall good stocks
purchased on the sharp break."

Nerv York Stock Market.
NEW TORK, Feb. 4.â Stock market opera
tions to-day were under the same constraint
as fcr several days past, and the movement
of prices again became wavering and uncer
tain aJter yesterday's decided downward move
ment. The sharp break in the morning while
prices of cotton were slumping and the sub
sequent roily with cotton, pointed to a sym
pathy between the two movements which leaves
little doubt that the collapse in cotton is view
ed with rrore or less apprehension In Wall
street. The general apprehension that the
long-deferred crisis in the Russo-Japanese con
test was at last at hand was a factor In the
rta^natlon of stocks here as well a* In for
eign ptoc-k markets. The further jump In
(Train and tho drop in cotton are the empirical
condition? of a warlike outcome. The highly
artificial conditions in the commodity market*,
dus to the excessive speculative commitments,
Kivf- them a feverish sensibility that robs them
of safety- as an index of conditions. The most
imrortant event of the day to the financial
markets was the ten days' notice given by
the. Secretary of the Treasury of a demand
for payment or 20 per cent of Government de
ports with national banks. This calls for about
$30,000,000 payable at New York. It is highly
probable, therefore, that interior Government
depositories wUl draw on their deposits with
New York banks to meet the Government's
call. As the Secretary's call says nothing of
further withdrawals or deposits in contempla
tion. Boms relief was afforded from the effect
caused by intimations heard yesterday that
the first call was soon to be followed by an
other for 10 per cent more of deposits. The
conjectural estimates of the effects upon the
money market here of the Panama canal pay
ments have counted upon the portion to be
paid directly from the United States treasury
as so much additinonal resources released to
the money market. The realization has been
growing that a larger portion than at first
supposed would have to be met by withdrawal
of Government deposits, and the quiet ac
ceptance given by the markets to the Secre
tary's call shows that itÂ« amount had been
pretty accurately foreseen In financial rirrles.
As to the effect on the money market of thes*
withdrawals. It is clearly dependent upon the
â¢"kill with which the banking in connection
with the payment Is carried through. A re

NEW YORK. Feb. 4.â The cotton market
opened weak at a decline of 47Â®59 points on
the old and 15@20 points on th* new crop
months, under continued liquidation and sell
ing for short account, accompanied by the
wildest excitement and confusion. Cables re
ported a net decline of 20^26 points at the
hour of .local opening and with no show of
bull support, the news from the Far East
threatening and bear confidence strengthened
the market after some little Irregularity turned
very weak. After March had been forced
down to 15.30c, May to 15.59c and July to
15.74c, a net loss on these months of about
61 to C6 point*, the entrance Into the ring
of the bull leader, who bid for May and July
restored confidence to some extent. The N#v
Orleans rrowd began buying in volume and
the market steadied up until it was within
10 or 16 points of yesterday's close. Follow
ing this the market in the late trading exhib
ited the most sensational fluctuations of the
day or season, or for â  that matter in the
history of the exchange. Shortly before clos
ing a rumor wan circulated that war had been
declared between Russia and Japan, and this
precipitated the market Into the wildest con
fusion. Long cotton wan fairly,, poured out
from alt Â»ideÂ». July broke about 70 points In
20 minutes, while In New Orleans It lout
nearly 106 points in the same time. From
15.83c, the high point for March locally, that
option was depressed to 14.77c: May sold down
from 16.12c to 15.0!>c, and July from 16.22c to
15.23c, these, prices representing net de
clines of lMfillO points. The market closed
at nearly the lowest, or at a net loss or 104
to 132 points on the old and of 30 to 50
points on the new cro:> months. Sales were
estimated at SOO.000 bales.

Future Grain and Provisions.
CHICAGO. Feb. 4.â All cereals made new
lilgh-r^cord marks to-day. Active buying on
the apparent certainty of war was the cause.
Owing to the critical state of affairs in the
Far East wheat traders were keyed up to a
high â¢ pitch at the opening. Shorts were so
energetlo in their efforts to get under cover
and the pit was so bare of offerings that before
the Initial demand was satisfied the price or
May was bid up %@%c to 1%@1%c above
last night's close, sales being made at 94>.4c to
Â»5%c. July was up V 4 c to lc at 85c to 85*4c
When May reached 95%c, which is a new high
record mark 'for the crop, active profit-taking
set In. Large quantities of wheat were put
out by commission houses and there was con
siderable' short selling. There was also some
selling In July, which was credited to the
leading long operator. The bull trader, how
ever, did not open business at any time dur
ing the day. As the session advanced the
market became quieter. Prices eased off under
a load of liquidation .until at one. time July
sol dunder yesterday's final figure, or at S4*4c.
a decline of l%c from the top. May sold off
to 94c, with. little, demand at the decline. The
market remained quiet and comparatively
steady until near the close, when another sharp
rally occurred. On renewed* rumors -of, warlike
moves commission houses became active buy
ers and shorts again started on a wild rush to
cover. The last few minutes of trading were
almost as tumultuous as were the opening ones,
and the volume of business was exceedingly
heavy. Prices at the close were near the top.
May being at 95*8@95%c. a net gain for the
day of lÂ»4c. July closed %@lc higher at 85%<5
85*ic.
The opening in corn was full of excitement,
as was the early trading in wheat. At first it
was all rush to buy. May was up %@%c to
Hi@l%c at 55%c to 56Vic. Within the first
few minutes of trading May sold at 56*4c. but
at that price the market ran Into heavy offer
ing from holders. Under heavy realizing sales
prices gradually worked their way down until
May had declined to 55c. Shortly before the
close a renewed demand sprang up, which car
ried prices well toward the top, final figures
on May being at 5t!c. a net gain for the day of
l@l%c.
Oats had the same wild experience as the
other markets at the opening, prices going up
sharpl" on general commission house buying
and active covering by shorts. May opened
Uc to *ic higher at 46%c to 46Vic. and within
fifteen minutes had advanced to 46%c. The de
cided rise brought out heavy liquidation. May
went back to 45 %c. Another rally occurred
near the end of the session and May closed %c
higher Â«t 46\4c.
Trading In provisions opaned with a big move
ment similar to the conditions witnessed In the
grain pits. Offerings were very Uht at the
start, which resulted In a considerable ad
vance In prices. Later there was heavy selling
of May lard by a prominent long. With the
break in grains the selling became general and
most of the early gain was Â»ost. The market
rallied later with wheat and corn and the close
waÂ« Htrong, with May pork up 7%c.

Potatoes, Onions and Vegetables.
All descriotions of table Burbanks were
firmly held at the previously quoted rates.
Stocks were plentiful and the demand was
light, but the market was controlled by a few |
dealers, who held the bulk of the supplies and '
prices were maintained. The steamer Oregon. |
which whs expected yesterday with nearly
10.000 sacks, is barbound on the Columbia
River and Is not expected to reach here before
Saturday, in which event there will bo no
fresh supplies on the market before Monday.
Sweet Potatoes were held at flrrrfer prices, but
moved rather slowly. Onions were in good re
quest and dealers were obliged to pay the top
quotation for the best Oregon stock.
New Potatoes from Alameda County were
offering at 3Â©4c per pound and were easily
disposed of at those figures. Receipts of String
Beans, Peas, Egg Plant and Green Peppers
from Los Angeles continued light and choice
lots were readily marketed at steady rates. '
Summer Squash and Tomatoes from the same
region were moro plentiful than usual, but
prlceÂ« were well maintained. There was not
much demand for Rhubarb and prices were
shaded, although only a few Doxes were re
ceived. No Asparagus came In.

Poultry'and Game.
Two cars of Western Poultry were marketed,
making four for the week, and moved off well
at good prices. Receipts of domestic stock
were moderate and younÂ«r fowl continued to
meet with a srood demand at previous prices.
Old Hens, and Roosters we.re weaker owing to I
the liberal offerings of Western, but prices were I
no lower. About 50 cases of dressed Turkeys I
came In and met with a fair Inquiry at the
previously quoted rates.
In the. market for Game Ducks had the most
call, and desnltc the fact that the birds were
poor and thin all descriptions were quoted
higher. Hare were abundant and lower.

. -Butter, Cheese and Eggs.
Most dealers reported a decline in Butter,
which wax dull with larger supplies than
have existed of late, while the demand was
correspondingly slow. It Is believed that the
top has been reached for this season, and that
if the State gets a good . wetting prices will
recede from now on. Some houses continued
to quote 31c for fancy creamery. . but this
figure was realized only in a small' way '
Cheese remains as previously quoted ' with
the rriarket still overstocked.
Those brokers who have been shipping Eggs
to the East and north reported yesterday that
the shipping ' demand was now about satis
fled, ' and that any further business in this
direction was out of the question at the pres
fnt high .prices. The second of the two cars
or the East was reported finally made up
yesterday, but the broker had a hard job get
ting the Eggs together, owing 1 to the scarcity
of stock. Prices showed no change. Receipts
were again in excess of 1000 cases, as will be
seen. . . ,
Receipts were 31,400' lbs Butter. 1079 cases

Deciduous and Citrus Fruits.
Local trade in Fruits was quiet owlnff to
the rainy weather, but a better feeling pre
vailed, particularly among handlers of Citrus
fruits, as It was generally expected that the
rain would 'be followed by a period of warm
weather, which would materially Increase the
demand. Aa it was. trading was confined
chiefly to large Navels and fancy 96a were
held at a substantial advance over the quota
tions. Fine large Grape Fruit was also held
at a premium, but the general run of offer
ings sold within the quoted range. The other
Citrus fruits were dull and featureless. Four
cars of Oranges are expected for to-day's
auction.
There was nothing new to report in Ap

â  NEW. ORLEANS, Feb. 4.â About the
â v <j;~t break in the history of cotton fu
tu:vs trading in New Orleans occurred
t^-ciay, svhen on vague war rumors
prices were rent down until they were
from 166 to ISO points lower than the
close of yesterday, and May was $3
cheaper. At the dose Â«jÂ£ the market,
however, there was little excitement
about the Cotton Exchange and no fear
was expressed that any of the local cot
ton firms would fail.
At the opening price? broke sharply,
March pcing off 106 points from yester
day's close to 15.T-0 cents. Prominent
bulls supported the market and prices
recovered. Toward noon the market be
< arm; quiet rind uninteresting, and the
general opinion v. as that the trend of
prices orould continue upward.
Soon after the noon hour and while
:any brokers were at lunch a telegram
\ as received from Chicago by a firm
saying that cables had been received
there telling of the declaration of war
between Japan and Russia. Values
commenced to slide downward swiftly.
2nd in five minutes the ring was in a
j-'ar.it. Traders and brokers who a few
minutes before appeared to be the
tancst and calmest of men suddenly
became crazy in their efforts to sell
-irli'-r their own or their customers'
cotton.
Hundreds r>f thousands of bales of
cotton w<-re thrown into the ring, and
the sellers exceeded buyers te-n to one.
A r.iad scene continued until well on
toward ihn <--lr>p<> of th<* market, vh^n
:*-<=â  rins finally had a ? old-out appear
ftrre. At this stage the bull leaders
again t>>ok a hand in ihe operations,.
and by buying everything offered and
l>y a strenuous bidding; quickly sent
rr\<-(*- tip fifty point?. The market,
however, had a weakened tone and the
irices attain sacsr^d toward th<3 close.
At the closing prices were from 147 to
168 paints lower than the close of yes
terday. On the curb the weakness con
tinuf-ii, and at the close of trading;
i lice? wrere agrain at about the lowest

LINER'S PASSENGERS SAY
THEY FEEL LIKE COLUMBUS
Eastern Tourists Return From Tahiti on the Steamship
Mariposa and Proclaim the South Sea Island a Par
adise Where Health and Rest Await All Comers
BRITISH SHIP MARATHON. BOUND FROM ANTWERP FOR THIS PORT*, WHICH WAS SPOKEN AT SEA
fflO MILES FROM HERE BY THE OCEANIC LINER MARIPOSA AND WHICH WISHED TO BE REPORT
ED ALL WELL.
The Oceanic Steamship Company's
liner Mariposa. Captain Rcnnie, which
arrived Wednesday evening from Ta
hiti, docked early yesterday at the Pa
cific-street wharf. Among the passen
gers were some Eastern people, who de
clared that they experienced all the
thrills which may with reason i>e sup
posed to have fallen to the share of
Christopher Columbus. 'Columbus dis
covered America." said one of them,
"but he found paradise. If the people
of the East knew of Tahiti as we do
now there would be a rush of travel
that even tho Mariposa could not carry.
If the timf at our disposal would allow
us to return to Tahiti when the Mari
posa goes back nothing could cause us
to forego the voyage. As it Is, we must
return to Chicago. Our trip has given
us something to talk about for the re
mainder of our lives. We have discov
ered the ideal vacation. The Mariposa
is as comfortable as any big, well-found
private yacht, and the memory of that
voyage through those wonderful sum
mer seas will never fade."
When the Mariposa returns Tahiti
will be at its best, and a large number
of passengers have been booked for the
next and subsenuent trips. Tahiti is
the only place within convenient reach
where the South Sea conditions of ro
mance can be seen and enjoyed at their
best, and this trip is growing in popu
larity among well-to-do Easterners in
search of novelty combined with rest.
The Mariposa's cargo consisted of
tropical products and included 73,526
cocoanuts, 207 barrels of pearl shell,
vanilla beans, alligator pears, pineap
ples, dried fish and candle nuts.
Captain Rennie reports that on Feb
ruary 1, in latitude 27 37 north, longi
tude 128 54 west, or about 600 miles from
this port, he spoke the British ship
Marathon, bound from Antwerp to this
port. Captain Rennie gave tho Mara
thon's captain his correct position. The

Fractures Her Hog-Chain..
The river steamer Columbia had a serious
miiha? en Wednesday â  afternoon while load
'.ng Irrn ai the Pacific Mail wharf. Under the
strsir of th<Â» heavy Ircipht piled at both ends
of the ves^*"l th*> hog chain on the starboard
side imactxvl with a loud report. Free from
thi* support, the h^-aTily laden ends of the
river su-amcr yielded to the pressure of the
iron's wriglit, and the Columbia developed a
nfrif-v!' case of hocback. The prompt rigging
of temporary taokl? prevoited the breaking
of the *t*amer*s back, and it may be possible,
with titw and stronger hog chains, to restore
the lort curve.

CAPTAIN LOSES

French Presbyterian Missionary
Schooner 3Jakes Pitcairn Isl
and After an Eventful Trip
VAIX SEARCH FOR LAND
Passengers Suffer Greatly
From Hunger and for Seve
ral Davs Are Without "Water
PAPEETE, Tahiti, Jan. 22.â The
French Presbyterian missionary schoon
er Croix du Sud, which touched at Pit
cairn Island on December 15, narrowly
escaped being lost with all on board
previous to its arrival at that port. The
story of its eventful voyage has been
told by Rev, Mr. Cody, a missionary,
who returned from Pitcairn.
About the middle of October the
schooner sailed from Malta!, Tahlt^
having on board a missionary party
headed by M. de Pamaret, president of
the Presbyterian Theological Seminary
at that place. The party was to make
a tour of the Protestant missions in
various islands, involving a trip of
more than 2000 miles. The vessel was In
charge of Captain Tore-a-nita, a na
tive, who even at the start distrusted
his own ability as a navigator. How
ever," he had previously skirted the
coast, taking United States Consul
Doty and Professor Aline from Papeete
to Maltai, and the missionaries em
barked on their long trip without mis
givings. It soon developed, however,
that the captain had lost his reckoning,
and. for many days the schooner en
gaged in a vain search for land. All on
board suffered greatly from hunger and
thirst, being at one. time for three days
and a half without" water. The three
small children of M. de Pamaret very
nearly succumbed. The schooner flew
a flag- of distress, which was sighted
on December 13 by the American bark
I. F. Chapman, Captain Kendall. The
little schooner was supplied with water
and stores and directed to Pitcairn Isl
and, where the suffering missionaries
were most kindly treated. There Cap
tain Young, a competent navigator,
took command of the Croix du Sud,
which then proceeded on its voyage.

HEAVY DRILLS
ARE IN ORDER
Infantry Troops at Presidio
Will Soon Begin Series of
Active Service Maneuvers
ARDUOUS WORK PLANNED
General 3IacArthur Will Call
Officially on Captain Piscetto
and Display His New Colprs
General MacArthur has practically
completed arrangements for the ac
tive service drills at the Presidio, In
which both the Tenth Infantry and
the Twenty-eighth Infantry are to
take part.
These drills will in all probability
bepin about March 1 and will con
tinue for a period of six months, there
being daily drills, excepting on Satur
day and Sunday during: that time.
Half of the time will be devoted to
what is called administration day, and
the remaining hiiif to what is known
as military day. These drills will take
place all over the different grounds at
the post, including the lower parade
ground, tha high lands back of the
point and the golf grounds. It is the
intention to conduct these drills just
as though the troops were participat
ing in actual warfare. Bridges will
be constructed, embankments thrown
up and every part and adjunct to mili
tary warfare to the minutest detail
will be entered into with all attention
j'ospible. It will be a case of arduDus
duty and will in some respects smack
of the training: and schooling that is
taken up at West Point. Both Colonel
Noble of the Tenth and Colonel Sweet
of the Twenty-eighth infantries are
entering into the spirit of the plan
with great enthusiasm.
MACARTHlirs NEW FLAG.
General MacArthur will make his
official call on Captain Ulrico Piscetto,
commander of the Italian cruiser
Puglia. to-morrow morning. Accom
panied by his aid. Major Parker W.
West, he will board the transport
Sherman's launch at 11 o'clock at the
foot of Folsom street and proceed to
the war vessel. General MacArthur
will use for the first time his new
major general's flag, which will float
from the stern of the launch. It is
brilliant red in color, relieved by two
!ar,7<| white stars. This flag is a recent
addition to army regulations. After
the general has paid -his respects to
the foreign visitor and departed from
the cruiser, the Puglia will fire a
salute of thirteen guns, while the gen
oral will s(and uncovered until the sa
lute is concluded.
The funeral of the late Captain Wil
li.im McCleave will take place from
his residence in Berkeley, after which
the remains will be brought to this
city for interment in the National
Cemetery. The funeral party will ar
rive at the Lombard-street entrance to
The post to-day shortly after 2 o'clock,
where it will be met by one com
pany of infantry from the cantc-nment.
which will act as escort and firing

chargers will be in waiting to bear the
body to its final resting place.
The aged captain left two sons. Cap
tain Edward G. McCleave. Twenty

and Captain Robert McCleave, sta
tioned at Fort D. A. Russell, Wyoming.

BOLTON, DE RUYTER & CO.
FACE HOST OF CREDITORS
Lay Blame for the Failure Upon Unwarranted Favors
Granted by Employes and Claim to Have Assets
Enough to Pay All Debts in Full on Basis of Showing
The creditors % ot the suspended
ployes of Bolton, de Duyter & Co.
& Co. met yesterday. They appointed
a committee of three to investigate and
heard a preliminary statement of the
financial condition of .the house, which,
as summarized by Thomas C. Van
Ness, attorney for the brokers, shows a
net indebtedness of $90,000 and net as
sets amounting to $98,000.
After the meeting Attorney Van Ness
made a statement. He said the fail
ure was due, as reported in The Call
yesterday morning, primarily to the
failure of Sharp & Bryan and sec
ondarily to the actions of trusted em
ployes of Bolton. De Ruyter & Co.
The employes referred to by Mr. Van
Ness are Richard Genung, manager,
and Daniel O'Connell, the former book
keeper. Mr. Van Ness estimated the
loss by manipulations of Genung and
O'Connell at *40,000.
Later in the afternoon, being inter
viewed by a reporter of The Call,
Genung, after having the statements
of Mr. Van Ness repeated to him and
being offered a chance to make a reply,
positively refused to say one. word for
publication. Mr. de Ruyter, who was
present at this interview, said In an
swer to a question that the firm had
no intention of proceeding against
Genung or O'Connell.
The creditors, after their meeting,
were not very sanguine, as. they openly
expressed their opinions that they
would not receive any large percentage
of their total claims. The assets are
largely book accounts against persons
in this city who have done business
with the firm in ordering purchases of
stocks or other securities on margins
and who are owing sums of varying
Eize to make goqd;' stocks that are re
ported to be held by brokers in New
York and office fixtures. There is also
a claim for $38,000 held by the firm as
an asset that is based on chattel and
second mortgage on land and crops in
California. One person, whose name
was not" given out by the firm, is re
ported to owe the sum of 510,000 'on
margins. This claim is reported to be
good. The stocks that are in the East
were purchased in the names of New
York brokers, but are reported to be
available as assets.
Mr. de Ruyter claimed yesterday af
ternoon that his firm would be able
to eventually pay every dollar to cred
itors, but time would be needed to ac
complish this.
VAX XESS EXPLAINS.
The chief interest In the proceedings
of the day was attached to the detailed
statements of Attorney Van Ness, in
substance as follows:
1 called the meeting of creditors to order
tcday and explained what the cause* of sus-
I>enÂ£ion were. These were the failure of
Sharp &. Uryan, which taxed the resources of
Bolton. de Ruyter & Co.. and the reduction
of the cash capital by Genung. who allowed
credits to run on the books of the firm, on
which there are losses of $40,000 to *50.000
to pay, without any return to the firm. The
partners found that there was no cash re
maining with which to carry on business and,
as to go on would be operating In the marks
against their customers, I advised suspension.
The preliminary report of the bookkeeper*
was submitted at the meeting of the creditors.
This made the net liabilities about $1KV.iÂ»kÂ»
and the assets about $116,000. of which $18.
000 on the books is bad, but $98,000 Is proba
bly good. The present available net asset*,
excluding chattel and second mortgage for
$38,000. is about $60,000. If the $38,000 Is
realized the creditors will be paid about dol
lar for dollar. The liabilities and assets as
cjuoted, I would not be understood as saying
are the total liabilities and assets, but they
are the net ones. The real figures might be
$300,000 and $200,000 as represented on the
books. The net figures are representative of
the conditions existing If the assets were to
be sold to-day.
I will explain how Genung could operate as
he has done. Suppose a friend of his came in
and asked to have a chance to gamble and
Raid that he had no money, but asked Genung
to put up. the friend promising to make good
for any lots. Possibly the friend might prom
ise to give Genung half of the profits. for the
credit. Genung would then take the money of
Bolton, De Ituyter & Co. and put It up. If
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 5, 1904
the market went against Genung's friend
then the loss would fall on Bolton, De Ruyter
& Co.
FIRM STILL IX DARK.
The firm dees not know how long this sort
of thine has been going ,on. The partners
have been together about three years and
Genung: has been with them all that time.
Probably Genung expected to make good, but
he got In deeper and deeper. Finally the firm
made the discovery that stocks that were
supposed to be to the credit of customers had
been sold. They found out that the accounts
had been Juggled with. Genung will not prob
ably be criminally prosecuted, for Bolton, de
Kuyter & Co. think the offense was a misuse
of credit rather than of money.
Mr. de Ruyter said that the losses
were entirely due to the work of Ge
nung and Daniel O'Connell. The former
would sell the ' stock and O'Connell
looked out for the books. "We had
absolute confidence in Genung," said
Mr. de Ruyter yesterday afternoon.
"If he had been a brother we could
not have trusted him more fully. I do
not feel inclined to prosecute him.: I
leave it to his conscience."
Late yesterday afternoon Mr. Van
Ness- said that Bolton and de Ruyter
will dissolve partnership and will liqui
date. Mr. de Ruyter, so said Mr. 'Van
Ness, has exhausted his resources. Mr.
Bolton has a membership in the Stock
and Bond Exchange. He will probably
continue' in the board and de Ruyter
will probably engage in some other
business.
From the opening business hour yes
terday morning the offices of Bolton,
de Ruyter & Co. were the center of in
terest on the part of creditors. All day
the partners were busily engaged until'
after the meeting of creditors had been
held. The accountants were working
all Wednesday night and had ready a
statement yesterday morning that was
presented to the creditors yesterday
afternoon. A detailed statement con
cerning the names of the creditors and
the amounts due to them respectively
was not made up.
Attorney Van Ness declared that
there were no large creditors. The. ap
pearance of the^ creditors when they
gathered in meeting in the afternoon
carried out this assertion. While there
were present among the assembled
creditors a few lawyers of- moderate
means and a few men whose business
standing Is good for considerable
amounts, the majority of the creditors
who were in attendance when Mr. 'Van
Ness called them, to order were men
unknown either in business, banking
or commerce. Their claims, ran not
more than a few hundred dollars each
on the average. The brokers refused to
give out any names or amounts In re
ferring to either their creditors or then
debtors, saying. that the business was
purely confidential.
CREDITORS' CO3IMITTEE.
On the whole the creditors were good
natured after the meeting. One of the
number, however, went down California
street exclaiming excitedly something
about handcuffs, but did not explain
what he meant. The creditors elected
J. H. Jellett as chairman of their com
mittee to investigate and report "con
cerning the transactions and standing
of Bolton, de Ruyter & Co.
The committee will make a report
at a meeting of the creditors to be
held one week from next Monday.
Mr. Jellett is an attorney of the firm
of Jellett & Meyerstein and is con
nected in a legal capacity with the
commercial agency of R. G. Dun &
Co. Jellett Bald last evening that the
committee will first obtain from Bol
ton. De Ruyter.& Co, a detailed state
ment and then will investigate- on
that basis, finding; out whether the
MAN* WHO IS BLAMED FOR
THE FAILURE AND CRED
ITORS' SPOKESMAN. - . .
statement is correct and learning
what can be- realized for the, benefit
of the creditors.
No brokers in this city have been
affected by the suspension of Bolton,
De Ituyter & Co. Only one member
of the firm belonged to the San Fran
cisco Stock and Bond Exchange/this
being Bolton. De Ruyter says that
no bank is concerned as a creditor.
While the suspension was discussed
by the brokers of the Stock and Bond
Exchange yesterday, before and after
meetings, there was no action to be
taken by the board, as the firm was
not a member. â¢ The volume of busi
ness transacted by the Stock and
Bond â¢ Exchange was not disturbed
visibly by the Bolton, De Ruyter mis
hap. Xo business was transacted by
Bolton. De Ruyter & Co. yesterday.
The experts . toiled j all day over the
books of .the concern. Until this work
is completed it will not be known how
long Genung and O'Connell operated.
O'Connell has hot been employed by
the firm for soine* months. He was
dismissed -about three months ago..
Since then he has been East and re
turned* toy this city .only recently. He
has played the races more or less.
That was the reason assigned for dis
missing him.
The firm of Bolton, De Ruyter & Co.
had no idea that O'Connell had any
thing to do with the shortage that has
been 'â¢ discovered until "Genung, being
questioned, , mentioned O'Connell's
name.'. â  To his friends O'Connell de
nies that he has operated In connec
tion with Genung and also denies
that he : was in any way-responsi
ble for: the shortage and the troubles
that, have befallen his former em
ployers. â  â  : .' f?;5?/ : .
CROCKER- WOOLWORTH BANK
The suspension of Bolton, de Ruy
ter & Co. caused surprise' at the
Crocker-Woolworth National Bank.
The first intelligence of the failure
was received at the bank late Wednes
day afterrioon.
"When I heard the news," said
Wellington Gregg, was utterly sur
prised. Bolton, de Ruyter & Co. have
an account with this bank, but they
do not owe us a dollar. The firm sim
ply had a balance here and checked
against it. When the firm began
business Will Crocker, who enter;
tained personal friendship. for Jack
de Ruyter, promised the latter to help
along in a business way, but the bank
had no Interest in the firm of brokers
beyond that."

ITALIAN MUSIC
RETAINS CHARM
Fills Lyric Hall With the At
mosphere That Permeated Old
Tivoli During Grand Opera
CONCERT AT ALHAMBEA
Neat Sum Is Netted by Event
for- Benefit of the Sacred
Heart Presentation Convent
Lyric Hall had an'atmosphere last
evening that was strikingly remindful
of the grand opera season at the old
Tivoii. Some of the Italian artists
were on the stage and many of the
former patrons were in the auditori
um. The music, too, strengthened the
remembrance, for the programme was
largely made up of selections from
the favorite Italian While the
glorious sextet from "Lucia" was be
ing sung, it required no severe strain
on the imagination to fancy oneself
back in the old house that for thirty
years was a shrine for San Francis
co's music worshipers.
The concert was given by a new vo
cal organization, the Verdi Interna
tional Sextet, composed of Miss V. C.
Hickey, soprano; Mrs. W. Briggs, so
prano; Miss M. Judson, contralto; Sig
nor, C. Cortesi, tenor; Signor C. S.
Wanrell, basso, and Signor D. Borghe
se, barytone. Professor S. Martinez
played the accompaniments. In the
concerted numbers the voices were
fairly well balanced, the tenor being
the only one that showed comparative
weakness. Cortesi's vocal equipment
is timeworn^nd harmonized but poor
ly with the young and flexible contral
to of Miss Judson, with whom he sang
a Verdi duo. Signor Borghese's sing
ing of the "Pagliacci" prologue was
the best executed solo of th.e pro
gramme. Every number was applaud
ed, however, and encores considerably
extended the ; previously prescribed
time. The audience was not as large
as the fame of the artists and the
make-up of the bill would have led
one to expect. The programme was
as follows:
Prologue of "PaicUacci" (Leoncavallo). Slg.
D. Borghese; duo from "11 Trovatore" (Verdi),
Miss M. Judson and Slg. O. duo from
"Forza del Drstlno" (Verdi). Mrs. \V. Briggs
and Si*. Wanrell; aria of -"La Cieca" from
"Gloccmla" (Ponchlelli), Miss M. Judson;
quintet from "Mose"' (Rossini). Mrs. Briggs.
Miss Judson and Slgnorl Cortesi, Borghese

(from "I Vesprl Siclliani") (Verdi). Slg. Wan
rell: rextft from "Lucia" (Donizetti). Miss
Hickey. Miss Judson and Slgnori Cortesi.
Borghese, Wanrell and Evans.
Rather a disappointing house
greeted the musical and dramatic en
tertainment at the Alhambra last
night for the benefit of the Sacred
Heart Presentation Convent. The de
serving institution owes $1100 for taxes
and the alumnae organized the ben
efit in the hope of raising the burden
from the shoulders of the meek women
who have given their lives to the high
er education of girls who otherwise
would be obliged to forego the ad
vantages of advanced courses. Nearly
half of the amount needed was raised,
from the proceeds of the entertain
ment. The programme was as fol
lows:

Drady; recitation (selected). Silas Alice Dono
hue; vocal duet, the Misses Kottanzl; violin

Miss Mary Carrlck gave a piano re

which 'brought out a large audience
composed of the music lovers of the
city. While at her last concert she
achieved a marked and pronounced
success, she showed last night that she
had made great strides over her pre
vious efforts. Her playing is clear cut
and facile. She interprets with intelli
gence and a thorough understanding of
the subject she is handling, and in
many instances her execution is of un
usual brilliancy. Her auditors were en
thusiastic and she was recalled after
every number. Following is the pro
