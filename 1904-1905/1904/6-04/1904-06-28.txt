TIENTSIN, June 27.â A correspond
ent has seen a translation of a private
letter from' an officer hign in command
under General Kuropatkin to a brother
officer, giving a gloomy view of the
situation for Russia and making dis-*
closures. The writer said:
. ','It^is a shame to see officers con
stantly quarreling, divided into cliques
and' fighting for their own Interests,
until ; Japan, the common enemy, is
forgotten. Every one, from the Vice
roy, and Kuropatkin to Insignificant
subalterns, is quarreling and unwilling
to obey orders. Until the whole systenf
Is changed we cannot hope for victory."

FEUDS IN RUSSIAN AR3IY.
WASHINGTON, June 27. â By order
of Cardinal Gibbons, who is one of the
most bitter denouncers of divorce In
the Catholic church, Roberta A. Dab
bin of this city, who- was recently mar
ried to George W. Fleckenschildt by
Rev. William Carroll of St. Patrick's
Church, has been excommunicated for
having deceived a priest In regard to
a former marriage 1 of Fleckenschildt.
Insofar as the Catholic church is con
cerned the marriage is null.
The order is the result of an in
vestigation which has been made by
Cardinal Gibbons of the charge that
Father Carroll was bribed by a sum of
money to perform the marriage cere
mony.
Father Carroll says he returned the
wedding fee' of $5 after discovering
that Fleckenschildt had been divorced.

According to a "press dispatch from
Tatchekiao to-day a large force has
pushed southward from Tatchekiao
against Oku. While Kuropatkln is thus
extending himself the Japanese, with
great mobility, "seem to.be trying to
concentrate for the purpose of striking
the Russians in flank and rear.
NAVAL LOSS A SEVERE BLOW.
Viceroy Alexieff's message, to-night,
with a brief dispatch from Rear Ad
miral Withoeft, naval commander at
Port Arthur, throws little, additional
light on the sea fight off Port Arthur._
The Admiralty and the Emperor are
awaiting' further details with the same
eagerness as the general public. The
latter to-day for the first time ; re-'
ceived information through the me
diums of foreign telegrams that a fight
has occurred. \ .'.. . .
The loss of "three vessels "of the. Port
Arthur fleet is admitted to be a severe
blow, especially if not purchased "( by
The main Japanese advance contin
ues along the main Fengwangcheng-
Liaoyang road, avoiding the Maotlen
Pass by a detour to the northward. The
advance in all points is being attended
by skirmishing.
Nothing Is known here of the exact
point at which Kuropatkln's main force
is concentrated, though It is believed
that a large part of the Llaoyang force
has been moved Jo a point between
Kinchou and Tatchekiao. .
ST. PETERSBURG, June 27.âLieu
tenant General Sakharoff's dispatch-re
ceived to-night confirms the belief that
the great decisive battle of. the cam
paign between General Kuropatkln's
main army and the armies of Generals
Kurokl and Oku is imminent. The three
armies aggregate 300,000 men, and their
outposts are to-day r in touch all along
the line. The Japanese evidently tried
to draw Kuropatkin as far : south as
possible, holding out as an incentive a
check to the advance of Oku's main
army.
Meantime Oku swung sharply to the
eastward to join Kuroki toward Cha
pan Pass, Kurokl at the same time
moving a strong force by the right
flank toward Haicheng.
greater loss to the Japanese than re
ported by Vice Admiral Togo. â¢
The meagerness of the report Is myj
tifying the authorities, .who continue to
believe there has been a later fight,
which has not been .reported.
In the absence of further Information
the Admiralty Is not disposed to criti
cize, although ; it ; is admitted to have
been unfortunate for the squadron at
such a critical time that its command
er should be 1 an officer like Withoefti
who, though personally a brave sailor,
never before ' blew hla flag over a
squadron. 'It is pointed out that he
could not- have been 'forced, to get" out
of Port Arthur, as the situation there
Is not yet by any j means desperate. If
he fought his " way back j through the
Investing fleet If was because, one of.
his patched-up ships had broken 'down
or for some other urgent reason. If
he arrived at the outer harbor at' night
he probably did not want to go into the
Inner roadstead,- because the narrow
ness of the channel made night naviga
tion dangerous, or, possibly, because
one of his "ships "stranded" at the en
trance of the channel. Nothing else
could account 1 for his remaining, in the
outer roadstead, where he would be ex
posed to the 'attack of the Japanese
torpedo-boats at night. ,
SKRYDLOFF MAY BE RAIDING.
There Is 'a- belief that the Vladivor.
stok squadron' put to sea on Saturday
and is .likely to. be; next heard of In
the Korean Straits. The Associated
Press has received a, curious dispatch
from a Russian correspondent at Vlad
ivostok, 1 -who took pains to sav that
Vice Admiral. SkrydlofTs squadron
probably * would s be . .unable to go , out
again for. weeks," as '. the ships , had to
go into *drydock- for the .purpose of
thoroughly - overhauling .their , boilers
and- cleaning . their hulls,' preparatory
to putting, to sea v , to; meet the Baltic
squadron. -The --> dispatch -added that
some of- the V torpedo-boats " had , been
battered 'by storm" during -the last ex
pedition to the Japanese coast. In con
clusion,^. the_i correspondent^savs 'that
nothing - has , been '; heard - of .-Vice Ad
miral Kamlmura'* ; squadron.** . . Â¦'
The statement ) that 'Prince "Jaime of
Bourbon was.an eye witness to the
killing of Russian wounded at Vafan
gow attracts considerable attention in
official circles, as the character of such
testimony cannot be ignored. Official
aqtion, . however, is likely to be de
ferred until the ' reports of the Rus
sian commanders have been received.
War Office officials are disposed to re
gard the acts as the work of individual
frenzied soldiers and they cannot be
lieve that Â¦ it Is the Intention of the
Japanese commanders to countenance
a : programme of "no quarter."
SALT LAKE. June 27. â Sudden

heard from off the Japanese coast or in the -vicinity of Port Arthur. .-:-

only four battleships, live cruisers ancV the torpedo-boats left the harbor on June 23.
Of these three returned badly damaged,but none sank. The several large ships pre
viously damaged carried no I guns. On June 24 the Japanese main army was within

Governor Pardee Is said to have
urged Willis to reconsider, and met
with a firm refusal. The resignation
goes Into effect on July 11. The place
is worth $200 a month and expenses
and lasts till January next. Governor
Pardee is silent as to Secretary Willis'
successor. ,-, <-. ,
Clarence Willis, son of the secretary,
who has been attached to the commit
tee as draughtsman, also resigned. The
entire Willis family will withdraw from
the State building. The only, statement
that Willis would make was this:
"I am tired out and want to give up
the job. I have worked as long as I
thought I could do the State any good.
I leav> all the befoks posted up and all
the work finished to the present time,
and my successor will have a clear
field. I have wanted to resign for a
long time, but out of courtesy to the
Governor, who has been my friend for
tw*nty-seven years, I waited until he
came. I am going to New York with
my wife and son on a visit to relatives
and will then return to California and
re-enter the newspaper business, which
is congenial to me. I want to say that
I leave here friendly with all and have
no ill will toward any one. My only
complaint is that I have been over
worked. I have not had one day to see
this fair since it opened."
Secretary Willis said nothing about
Fome things that have been gossip
among a few of the California colony
for weeks. One of these Is that there
have been strained relations between
Mrs. Wiggins, wife of one of the com
missioners, and Mrs. Willis, and that
for more than a fortnight they have
not spoken nor taken their meals at
tbe same time in the upper part of the
Ftate building, which is reserved for
the exclusive use of the official family.
This trouble did not prow out of a ques
tion of social precedence, as sometimes
occurs at th^ court of King Edward,
but because Mrs. Wiggins thought, so
it Ik said, that Mrs. Willis should de
vote more of her time to talking to vis
itors downstairs, though Mrs. Willis
declared she could not stand the strain
of giving the glad hand all day long.
The coldness spread to Wiggins and
Willis, it is alleged, and there has been
little cordiality between them. Willis
has been dissatisfied with affairs In
general.
ST. LOUIS, June 27.â Troubles which
havfc been brewing in the California
Worlds Fair committee official family
almost eince the opening of the exposi
tion,- but which have been known to
but a few outside the Mission building,
culminated to-day in the resignation of
K. B. Willis, secretary of the commit
tee. He chose the time when Governor
Pardee was here to sever his connec
tion.

INDIANAPOLIS. June 27.â The Pro
hibition leaders who are gathering for
the national convention are still "up
in the air" on the Presidential prob
lem. It Is General Miles who Is keep-
Ing them there. National Committee
man Metcalf said to-day that when a
party of ten Prohibitionists, of which
he was one, called upon General Miles,
the general was evasive and wished
the convention postponed until after
the Democratic convention. Thia, it
is said, ha? been his policy since that
time. Metcalf asserted that, in hla
opini m. : the New England' States
would demand a man who would make
a positive statement of his' position,
and unless General Miles made one
they would vote against him. National
Chairman Stewart said to-day:
"General Miles is a very able man.
He has been a consistent friend of the
anti-liquor movement and in a broad
sense a prohibitionist, but even those
who are pressing forward his name for
the nomination by our party this year
do not say how he stands on the meth
ods of the Prohibition party."
Alonzo E. Wilson of Chicago, Charles
D. Jones of Pennsylvania and John G.
Woolley, the candidate for President
four year3 ago, are prominent In tha
management of the Miles boom. Wil
son has shipped to Indianapolis a lot
of Miles lithographs and a barrel or
two of Miles campaign buttons.

gelist; James A. Tate of Tennessee.

of Rogers and he is now in Jail.
FREQUENTLY HEATS FILE.
HOUSTON, Tex., June 27. â Mrs.
Julia Rogers, a comely young married
woman, appeared before Justice of the
Peace Matthews to-day with a face
that bore evidence of intense physical
suffering. To the magistrate she ex
hibited proof of inhuman cruelties
heaped upon her last night by her hus
band, Monroe Rogers. The story she
told would have done ample Justice to
the torture chambers of the dark
ages. The jealousy of her husband,
which, she claims, was without foun
dation," is responsible.
With eyes streaming with tears, Mrs.
Rogers exhibited her arms, 'upon
which were frightful burns, arranged
so as to distinctly form the letters of
a" man's name, and he the one who
the jealous husband' believed had in
vaded his home. With his wife gagged,
bound and hung up by the feet, the
jealous husband took his time at heat
ing irons and branding the flesh of the
helpless woman. After 'completing his
fiendish work he left her in her sus
pended position, but removed the gags
that she might cry for help.
Tn p'.aces th*. burns reached to the
bone and' nothing but death will erasja
the name of the imagined rival.
TORTURED FOR HOURS.
Two weeks ago Rogers left home on
a business trip to Sour Lake. His wife
went to live with her sister during his
absence. Yesterdayfetogers returned,
went for his wife and escorted her
home. There was no warning of the
atrocity he was about to perpetrate.
, He procured a quantity of rope, en
tered his wife's room last night, and.
overpowering her, tied her hands and
feet and then gagged her. Removing
her clothing, he suspended her by the
feet with a rope looped through the
transom of a door. He then lighted a
lamp and secured an old file twelve
inches long. He held the file over the
oil blaze until it was red hot and be
gan burning the fiery letters. Smoke
and the fumes of burning flesh filled
the house. He started on the "bare
shoulder and wrote down the arm to
the wrist.
Special Dispatch to The Call
On the other hand, the figures show a
decrease In deaths from consunjptlon
of nearly 55 per cent.
The mortality statistics shoNv that
the increase in pneumonia deaths from
1890 to 19'0 was 5 per cent; of heart
disease, 12 per cent; of kidney disease,
44 per cent; of apoplexy, 17 per cent; of
cancer. 12 per cent.
COAST WOMEN MARRY.
Judging from the figures, the Pa
cific Coast States are the best for mar
riageable women, 60 per cent being
wives, against 59 per cent in the Cen
tral West and 54 per cent in the East.
Contrariwise, the Pacific Coast shows
the smallest percentage of married
men â 45 per cent, against a general
average of 55 per cent in the East and
Middle West.
The average number of persons to a
family in the United States is 4.7. In
1900 the percentage of married among
all persons 15 years or over was 55.5;
of single, 36; of widowed, almost 8 per
cent, and of divorced, four-tenths of 1
per cent:
New York State has the unpleasant
but natural pre-eminence of having
more persons to a dwelling (seven;
than any other State In the Union.
This, of course, is due to the tenement
houses of the metropolis.
Not so agreeable as a national show
ing Is the fact that the number of fam
ilies owning their houses is decreasing.
It is worthy of note that the percent
age of homes owned rises generally
with the Increase of the farming popu
lation and falls with the growing pre
ponderance of the industrial classes.
While the negroes in the South are
largely responsible for this, huge total,
there are still 3,200,000. whites In the il
literate class. Of foreign born illiter
ates New York State has 258,000, or al
most 20 per cent of the total in the,
country. But the Empire State has in
addition 47,000 natives who cannot read
or write. In view of the immense
throng of immigrants that settle in
New York State, it is one of the sur
prising facts that the percentage of
increase of native born In ten years
slightly exceeded the percentage of in
crease of 'foreign born. The showing
Is contrary to that of nearly every
other populous Eastern State.
What might be called family statis
tics present some novel phases. An ex
hibit pleasing to the social reformer Is
a demonstration that the average num
ber of persons to a dwelling is falling.
Thus, in 1900 it was 5.3 persons, while
In 1890 It was 5.5.
XEW YORK HOMES CROWDED.
JfANY. JIXITERATE WHITES.
As a matter of fact the actual num
ber of English, Irish, German and
French residents of the United States
decreased in these ten years, while
Poles, Hungarians, Russians and Ital
ians Increased by a large percentage.
Not entirely disconnected with the
decline in immigration is the pleasing
demonstration by figures that illiteracy
in the United States is decreasing.
Even with the increase in population
of more than 20 per cent from 1890 to
1900, the number of illiterates fell nearly
150,000 in the decade. Yet, even in 1900.
there were 6,180,000 persons 10 years old
or more in the' United States unable to
read or write.
Few realize that the native born
population in ten years rose 22 per cent
and the foreign born less than 12 per
cent. It is apparent "hard times"
were the chief cause of the comparative
decrease of the foreign born population.

"Not the least interesting revelation
of the war," says the correspondent,

Japanese cavalry.^whlch hitherto has

it has shown itself superior, especially
in the hilly districts."

QUARTERS IN THE FIELD. FENG
WANGCHENG. SUNDAY, June 26.â A
party of eighteen correspondents and
military attaches has been -conducted
on a tour of the main Japanese 'works
beyond headquarters. It was seen that
great care had been taken in building
these works and the attaches remarked
that the temporary defenses had been
constructed with more pains than most
European armies would take under
similar circumstances.
At Liaoyang, where it was hitherto
thought the first meeting between the

Russians have guns in. position mount

WELL BUILT ENTRENCHMENTS.
All day yesterday Russian troops
were hurrying southward from Tatche
kiao. and as night fell battalions were
continuously moving out briskly to the
accompaniment of their battle songs.
Clouds at dust hun^.over the marching
columns, and the chorus of the In
fantry singers was occasionally inter
rupted by the rattle and clang of guns
drawn at a ptr.art trot and followed by
giilloi'fcr.g Squadrons of cavalry. It was
a stirring spectacle to see the Russian
fenny eagerly hast^niiig. singing, into
battle. The old battle hymns last heard
in the Balkans res-ounded among the
hills and valleys as v ith bayonets glis
tening in the sun the regimental colors
were borne majestically forward. For
hours after darkness fell over the scene
one could still hear the rattle of mov
ing guns, the creaking of commissariat
wagnns and the tread of inarching
men, while occasionally in place of the
war songs of the soldiers homely melo
dies recounting the joys of village life,
which, carried the minds of the men
back to their distant homes in Russia,
echoed through the air.
As this dispatch is filed news has
leached here that General Kuroki is
marching upon Haicheng.
Sharp firing was heard in the hitts
yesterday at daybreak and severe fight
ing is recited to be In progress near
ihe village of Touches. An officer who

June 27.â A great battle seems to be
impendir4gk A portion of the Russian
army has assumed the offensive against
the Japanese forces commanded by
General Oku. and it is reported that
General Kuroki is moving along the
Russian left flank against Haicheng.
According to a high personage General
Kuroki'p army is strong enough to take
the offensive, and he presumably is
anxious for a decisive action before the
rains begin.
says:' . - Â¦ Â¦ ... Â¦Â¦ ' Â¦ ' -â¢
"The effect of the attack and the
small loss must be- attributed to the
Illustrious virtues of his MaJeBty." ,
"At dawn on Friday a 7 reconnais
sance of the entrance was made by the
fourth and fifth flotillas.* whose report
confirmed that of the patrol ships as
to the Russian loss."
Admiral Togo says the moonlight and
the narrow line of the enemy "prevented
his fleet inflicting greater damage. The
Japanese loss was unexpectedly, small.
The destroyer Shirakumo was â¢ struck
in the .cabin and three of her crew
were killed and three wounded. The
first-class torpedo boat Chidori was
strucR-- In the engine-room. Torpedo
boats 64, 66 and 53 were damaged. The
others engaged were uninjured. . Vln
concluding his report Admiral .Togo
"At 8:22 p. m. the small flotillas
swung around the rear of the Japan
ese fleet' and headed toward the Rus
sians at full speed.
"At 9:30 p: m. the fourteenth flotilla
delivered the first attack on the Rus
sian fleet, now in the rear of a point
five miles outside the entrance to Port
Arthur. Immediately after\fard the
fifth flotilla delivered a second attack.
The Russian fleet was confused and It
was impossible for it to retreat quickly
into the harbor on^account of the nar
rowness of the channel and, possibly,
the low tide.
"At 10:30 p. m. the Russian fleet
anchored in a single line extending
from the Xpot of Wantsucing fort to
the base of Chentaorhan. During the
night the torpedo flotillas kept up con
stant attacks on the Russian fleet, go
ing in eight times.
"The most effective attack was that
of the sixteenth flotilla, which, at 11:30
p. m., caught the Russians rounding
Shenshen. The first-class torpedo boat
Shirataka, Commander Wakabayashi,
sent two torpedoes into a battleship
of the Peresviet class. She was seen
to sink in a volume of smoke and fire.
Other effects . of the attack were not
observed, on account of the heavy fir
ing which cast volumes of water over
the flotilla and the .heavy cannonading
which rent the air* The searchlights
from the ships and~forts also blinded
the Japanese.
RUSSIAN LOSS CONFIRMED.
"The vessels engaged In clearing the
harbor finally made a passage and the
Novik led the Russian fleet seaward.
In the meantime Admiral Togo con
cealed the positions of his ships and
at 4 o'clock sent the third squadron out
into the vision of the Russians, with
the object of drawing them seaward.
The Russian fleet stood southeastward
and then southward. During this time
Admiral Togo concealed his first
squadron south of Gugan rock. As
the Russians approached Admiral
Togo assembled his fleet and prepared
to attack. At 6; 15 p. m. the Russians
were in plain sight eight miles north
west of Gugan rock. The Cesarevitch
led and the nine others followed in a
single line. The Novik and seven de
stroyers were placed at the right of
the line. Admiral Togo waited, with
battle flags flying from all the tops.
The Japanese fleet formation repre
sented the first letter of, the Japanese
alphabet. Inverted.
"At 7:30 j). m. the Russians headed
for the Japanese and Admiral Togo
veered slightly to the right, in order
to bring pressure against the "head of
the Russian formation. At 8 p. m. the
Russians changed their course and
headed northward. Admiral Togo fol
lowed in a long single line, ordering
the destroyers and torpedo boats to
prepare for an attack after sundown.
SMALL FLOTILLAS ATTACK.
"Captain Asai, commanding the Jap
anese torpedo flotilla, attacked the ves
sels erigaged in clearing out the mines
and hariipered the work. At ; 3 o'clock
seven Russian destroyers appeared und
the Japanese vigorously attacked them.
One of the Russian destroyers, which
was hit and set on fire, retreated to
the harbor burning. The Nov'.k at
tacked the Japanese, who scurried
away.
The entire 1 Russian fleet steamed out
to sea in line of battle. Suddenly when
within 14,000 meters of the Japanese fleet
the Russians refused battle and steamed
I back to an anchorage outside the har
bor. Where during the night the Japanese
destroyers and, torpedo-boats made
eight desperate attacks upon It.' The
Russian vessels re-entered the harbor
on Friday,, since which time it has
failed to appear.- In his report Admiral
Togo says: ;
"The exit: of the Russian fleet from
Port Arthur harbor began early Thurs
day., The battleships Peresviet, Pol
tava arid Sevastopol, the armored
cruiser Bayan and the protected cruis
ers Pellada, Diana, Askold and Novik
came first, a steamship leading them,
clearing mines.
"A warning^flashed by wireless tele
graph by the Japanese patrol brought
up Admiral Togo's fleet at full speed
to a series of prearranged stations.
Three flotillas of Japanese destroyers j
and torpedo-boats steamed close to the
harbor entrance and watched the Rus
sian vessels. At 11 o'clock the Russian
battleships Cesarevitch, Retvizan and
Pobieda Joined the other Russian ships
outside the. harbor. Several steamships
and boats were engaged in clearing
and exploding mines, in order to make
a passage seaward.

TOKIO, June 27.â Togo's detailed re
port of his attack on Port Arthur last
Thursday night has reached Tokio. It
confirms the reported destruction of a
Russian battleship of the Peresviet
type/fiha disabling of a battleship of
the Sevastopol class and a protected
cruise*- resembling the Diana and the
damaging of a torpedo destroyer, but
throws no, light upon the Russian plan.
ST PETERSBURG, June 27.â The
Japanese have evacuated Senuchen,
apparently with the object of enticing
General Kuropatkin southward. In the
meanwhile General Kuroki is advanc
ing on Haicheng. ready to attack the
Russian left, and is again moving
troops north from Fengwangcheng.
The Russians lost eighty-one men in
the recent fight north of Aiyangpien
men, about sixty, miles northeast of
Fengwangcheng, Â«n the Mukden road.
-Not since the war began has such an
air of excitement pervaded, the War,
Office and Admiralty. The news re
ceived during the next few days is ex
pected to largely determine the fate of
the present campaign on land and sea.
The spirits of the Russians have appre
ciably risen at the prospect that, after
all, the sortie of the squadron of 'Rear
Admiral Withoeft, in command of the
naval forces at Port Arthur, while it
may have resulted in the loss of some
of the Russian ships, has been success

CHEFU, June 27.â While cruising off
Port Arthur on Saturday morning the
Chicago News' dispatch-boat Fawan
heard continued firing from 3 to 6
o'clock. It was concluded the Japanese
were making another reconnaissance.
At 2 o'clock that afternoon a Japanese
cruiser, four destroyers and four tor
pedo boats approached from the east,
but retired at 5 o'clock withcrut ac
tion. One of the destroyers evidently
had been recently in action, as two of
her funnels were patched and knocked
out of line. The cruiser sent a boat
to board and search the Fawan. An
officer said the fall of Port Arthur was
expected at about the middle of next
month. He indicated,- that the shore
fighting was progressing steadily. He
said the Russian cruisers Askold and
Diana were injured in the fight on
June 22.
Intermittent firing was heard from
behind the fortress all Sunday as the
Fawan cruised off the coast. The at-'
tack appeared especially heavy be
tween 4 and 5 o'clock in the afternoon,
after which it ceased.
The Fawan found a mine adrift near
Miaotao- Islands. On examination it
proved to be a Russian electro-contact
mine. The Japanese mines are en
tirely different.
Several bodies of Russian sailors
came ashore on the islands within the
last few days. It is supposed they
came from the battleship that was
sunk in the naval fight last Thursday.

without result.
"At this moment our Infantry came

TACOMA. Wash., June 27. â After
seventy-two straight trips to Honolulu
without a break, the barkentine
Klickitat will enter the California lum
ber trade. She ia now loading lumber
at Port Gamble for San Pedro and
will probably remain on that route for
some time. This change is due to dull
ness in the Hawaiian lumber market.
Captain Cutler has spent a number
of years aruiding the Klickitat back
and forth between Port Gamble and
Honolulu. Water front men claim
to be. laying wagers that the old
barkentine will ado^t the tactics 1 of
a frisky bronco when she gets down
the coast and refuse to be ' headed

holds the record for the number of
voyages made by a sailing vessel be

EMINENT JESUIT DEAD.
Yesterday Durkin told his wife that
he was going tp San Jose and to
Oakland to attend to some business.
Later In the afternoon it was reported
that both he and Miss Starr had
been seen together in Oakland. Dur
kin had signed a contract with the
Alcazar management to play leads for
next season, but owing to his conduct
with Miss Starr the management has
canceled the contract. Miss Starr
closed her engagement Sunday night
She was to have returned ln two weeks
for another season, but ahe was not
re-signed.
It is reDorted that Mrs. Durkin
went to the Alcazar one evenfng. after
she knew of the affair, and had an
Interview with her husband and Miss
Starr. She pleaded with the latter
not to wreck her happiness and bring
disgrace upon Durkin's ( widowed
mother and her own (.Miss Starr's)
family. Then it Is claimed Miss Starr
said that they had both tried to break
off the intimacy several times, but
had failed; that she loved Mr. Dur
kin and would not give him ud.
After five years of happiness the
husband's weakness had shattered the
dream. Still the wife maintains- amid
sobs that she cannot understand it
all; she was a loving and true wife,
took care of him when he was suffer
ing from a painful accident, and still
half doubts his fault. At the Al
cazar Mrs. Durkin is spoken of as a
quiet, modest little woman, and some
of Durkin's personal friends are out
spoken in condemning his treatment
of her. Mrs. Durkin Is a Pitts
burg girl and is practically alone here.
She is of a retiring disposition and
has few friends to stand by her In her
trouble.
spies about him. Never had she
dreamed of following her husband to
the theater; he had her trust and
faith. Later, however, a chance re
mark in her hearing opened her
eyes and she left her husband In the
vain hope that her absence would
show him his folly. When she left
him he removed to an apartment
house on Post street.
she should get any judgment against
the property. She says that Marchand
has gone to France and that Priet is
planning to sell the business and go
there too. This, she says, is with the
intent to evade and defeat the order of
the court.
Jlr. and Mrs. Marchand were married
in Alameda County September 9, 1SS4.

When the Rev. Dr. John Hemphill
had pronounced the benediction and the
newly wed couple turned from the altar
to leave the church, the venerable com
mander of the assciatlon stepped Into
the aisle.
"Attention'." rang out hla soldierly
voice; "salute!"
Instantly every veteran's right hand
came up and the pretty bride passed
between rows of gray haired men who
wished her long life and happiness.
After the ceremony a small recep
tion was held at the home of the
bride's mother, to which the bridal
party and a few intimate friends were
bidden.
An Incident full of dramatic pathos
occurred at the conclusion of the mar
riage service. The bride's late father
was_ a soldier In the Mexican war, and
when she was hardly more than an in
fant the local association of veterans of
that war adopted her as "a daughter of
the regiment." Last night the asso
ciation turned out In force to do honor
to the child of their dead comrade.
The attendants upon the statuesque
bride were Miss Alice Ludlum of Den
ver, maid of honor, who wore a dainty
white frock with a half-wreath of
white rosebuds in her hair; Miss Eu
genie Hawes. Miss Beatrice Splivalo
and Miss Imogen Ludlum of Los An
geles, all of whom were smartly frock
ed in white, wearing pink wreaths.
The bridal party in the processional
was grouped effectively, Mr. and Mrs.
J. B. Shroeder Jr. leading the way.
Then followed the ushers, A. W. Fol
lansbee Jr. and Thomas Dening and
the bride's mother. Mrs. M. V. Ting
ley-Lawrence, on the arm of Ransome
Carey Van Fleet.
The bride was escorted to the altar
and given away by General Lucius
Harwood Foote, an old friend of the
family.
Mr. Dean was attended by Lucian
Knight.
Gayly the wedding bells rang last
night, when Miss Catherine V. Law
rence plighted her troth to Robert
Armstrong Dean m the presence of
hosts of fond friends at Calvary Pres
byterian Church.
The bride, a maid of distinctive style,
Â¦wore a robe of white mousseline satin,
with a bertha of rose point. Proudly
upon her brow a wreath of orange
blossoms lay, holding in place a soft
tulle veil. Lilies of the valley formed
the bridal bouquet.

James I>u.rkin. formerly leading man
at the Alcazar Theater, to break faith
with his sweet little wife and to lay
at the feet of Miss Frances Starr the
devotion he owes and once paid to
the woman that bears his name. The
story dates back to the time that Miss
Starr and Durkin were cast to play
parts that had very stron? love
scenes. Almost before they were
aware of their danger their feelings
got beyond control. Engagements
were made for meetings outside the
theater. The little wife who was be
ing left alone began to wonder at the
change in â¢ her hustnnd's i manner
toward her. Members of the Alcazar
company began to notice. The men

filed in the Superior Court a volumin
ous complaint, in which the allegations
are numerous and speciac. Its basis is
domestic differ^Eces. upon which she
founds her charges of business frauds
and financial complexities.
Mrs. Marchand asks for a divorce
from her husbind. Edward llarchand.
who is in France-. She also asks for
an injun-::ioa preventing Priet & Co.
from selling the Marehand restaurant;
she asks the court to appoint a re
ceiver tor the restaarant business in
order that its profits may be kept
r.ithin reach of the court, and de
mands an accounting from Pierre Priet
of his business dealings with her hus
band, both in relation to the restau
rant and their interest in the property
on O'Farrell, street, near Powell; she
asks that Priet be declared indebted
to her husbani for 510.000 of the tatter's
money, which he used to pay off a
mortgage; she asks the court to assign
as community property a third interest
in the property and income of the busi
ness and the $-5.<XW of Marchand's
money which she says Priet invested
for him in the O'Farrell street pro-p
erty. And Finding the hearing of this
litigution Mrs. Marchand wants $3i)O a
month alimony. S~50 for costs and $750
for attorney's fees.
Preliminary to these demands the
plaintiff recites that her husband is
puilty cf desertion, in that he left her
en July 2C. 1902: of willful neglect. In
that since then he has failed to pro
vide her with the necessaries of life,
and of extreme cruelty, in that he
caused to be published in the San Fran
cisco newspapers a notice that he would
not be responsible for her debts. This
latter act, she says, was done for the
purpose of humiliating her before her
friends, and since then he has taunted,
maligned and slandered her and held
her up to ridicule by circulating false
statements affecting her treatment of
him.
Sir Tatton Sykes. th- we!l-kno-^ii

been traveling ever since. Countess de
Lkhierwe'de is well advanced in years
and -lurin? her last visit to S'an Fran
cisco with ?ir Tatton Sykes acted both
for herself and him in all matters con-
Câ¬rning' the welfare at thÂ«? Palac-
Hotel, -where they occupied the best of
apartments adjoining each other, and
remained secluded during the better
part of their stay here. Their close at
tention to each other Ln the colonies,
according' to the stories received here
yesterday, caused a report to be circu
lated there that they had been secretly
married. but this rumor v.-as soon dis
pelled when it became generally known
that the court of Er.?!and, which heard
Sir Tatton's suit against La.dy ijyie3.
simply granted him a separation and
not absolute divorce.
Much to the surprise of the passen
gers v.ho embarked on the Sierra with
Sir Tatton Sykes and Countess de
Lichterwelde in the colonies, the Baro
â¢net registered the Countess as "Lady
Sykes," and she continued to be known
as such untit the couple arrived at the

under their respective titles and were

NEW YORK, June 27.â Frank Henry
Burness, one of the most remarkable
prisoners that ever occupied the death
Â¦house at Sing Sing Prison, went to his
death in the electric chair to-day.
With a smile on his face, he walked
from his cell and, seating himself in
the chair, assisted the men in adjusting
the straps which were to bind him.
Four shocks were given before he was
pronounced dead.
The crime for which Burness was
executed was the killing of Captain
George B. Townsend of the schooner
Charles Buckley last November, but
he also had confessed to having mur
dered no less than four persons. Town
send was killed during a dispute over
wages amounting to about ?20, which
Burness claimed was due him. When
convicted of the latest crime he an
nounced that he was willing to waive
the six weeks that the law requires to
elapse between the time of sentence
and the execution. .Despite his ob
jections the case was carried to the
Court of Appeals and after a long de
lay the sentence was affirmed. When
informed that the end was to come at
last, Burness expressed himself as
pleased that there would be no more
delay.
"I deserve to die," he told the prison
officials, "and the sooner they put an
end to my troubles the better. I've got
an uncontrollable temper and if re
leased would only commit more vio
lent crimes. I would kill a man for
five cents as quick as for anything
else." ,
Burness was born in Butler, Pa., 44
years ago. He had refused religious
consolation.

J. Henderson Jr. of Jersey City and
Joseph M. Newlln of Philadelphia,
counsel- for V George Rice of Marietta,

Standard Oil Company, New Jersey

States and of the decisions of the State
courts relating to-rnonopolies. '
The bill charges that the Standard Oil
Company of Ohio was declared illegal by
the courts of that State, but that the
company, instead of dissolving in obed
ience to that decision, has, by^ subter
fuge,, evaded the Ohio decision, and that
the New Jersey corporation is merely

The fireworks concern occupied the
firet floor of the building. The second
floor was vacant and the third story
was occupied by tn,e French Hat and
Bonnet Frame Company. Jancovitch
Â¦was the proprietor of the hat and bon
net concern, and Berman and Miss
Betnpeoa were his employes. These
three were the only persons above the
first floor. About a dozen persons were
employed by the fireworks company.
The cause of the fireworks explosion
is not known. Thomas Conway, one
of the fireworks firm, was wrapping a
small bundle of fireworks for a cus-,
tomer when it exploded. . Almost in
stantly the entire roomful of fireworks
hecarne ignited from flying rockets and
firecrackers. All the employes on the
first floor escaped without serious in
jury- The front of the first floor was
Mown out by the explosion oL. powder,
and soon the entire building was in
flarnes. Every effort was made to res
cue those on the third floor. Firemen
climbed ladders in the midst of the
pyrotechnics and finally reached those
on the third floor. Miss Rernpson and
Jancovitch were found aJive. but died
in a hospital. Berman was dead when
he was taken from the building.
During the fire's progress three fire
men were injured and three other per
sons were also cut and burned, but
their injuries were not pfrious.

Mr. St. John- and the inspectors de

Judge de Haven took the case un
der advisement.
Mrs. Haley in her deposition said:
DISCOURTESY ALLEGED.
The women contented themsÂ«lves
with entering upon their declarations
simply the number of pieces of bag
gage and trunks in their possession.
When asked by customs inspectors as
to whether they had any dutiable
articles in their baggage they replied
in the negative.
Inspector L. Lorentzen swore yes
terday that Mrs. Boettcher in answer
to his question as to whether she had
any silks*, cloisonne or other dutiable
goods in her baggage, had said flatly
that she had not. He_told about hav
ing found bolts of^iHk basted into the
shape of garments in her trunks.
Deputy Customs Surveyor Chauncey
Milton St. John testified that he had
asked the ladies whether they had any
dutiable articles in their baggage and
that they had replied that they did not
have any.
Inspector A. Sti%*ers said that Miss
McMurtrie had denied the possession
of dutiable articles. Nearly every, gar
ment of hers that he had found had
something dutiable sewed up in it, he
added. In one of her trunks he found
several dutiable articles concealed be
tween the. lining and the bottom of the
trunk. The lining had been ripped to
allow the goods to be placed there and
had been sewed up again.
Depositions from the women were
read, in which it appeared that they
had omitted to make the necessary
declarations, because they could not
remember every item and . its price,
and that they stood ready to pay what
ever duties might be found due. They
complained that their clothing was
thrown upon the dirty dock and soiled
and ruined.
Notfc? to Passengers: It will be necessary
for you to make a declaration, under oath be.
fere a,cuj>tome officer, before leaving this ves
sel. etatlnR the number of your trunks and
other packages, together with their dutiable
contents.
Residents of the United States returning
from abroad should prepare a, detailed list of
all articles purchased or otherwise obtained
abixad and the prices paid therefor, or the
value thertof. specifying separately wearing
apr>ar*l. articles of personal adornment, toilet
articles and Kimilar personal effects. The ex
emption of $100 allowed by law will be made
by the appraiser at the dÂ«>ck. Articles, includ
ing we&rlr.g apparel, will be appraised at the
market price In the country where purchased.
To All Passengers: a failure to declare any
dutiable goods in your possession will render
the Â«arrte liable to seizure and confiscation, and
yourself to the full penalties o f the law, sec
tion 2S02. RevisM Statutes, providing that
"Whenever any article subject to duty is found
in the baggage of any person arriving within
the United States which was not, at the time
r.f making entry for such baggage, mentioned

made, by the person making entry, such article
fhall be forfeited, and the person in whose

The testimony |howed that upon the
arrival of the steamer at this port the
two women, as well as the rest of the
passengers, were served with a printed
notice, from which the following are
extracts:
AN UNHEEDED WARNING.
Mrs. Fannie A. Boettchcr and Miss
Nettie McMurtrie, now Mrs. Nettie B.
Haley, believe that $6786 is a sum well
worth fighting for, and the time of the
United States District Court was taken
up yesterday in the hearing of their
contest for the recovery of the money
from the coffers of Uncle Sam.
The money was paid by them two
years ago as a treble value penalty
for having failed to declare dutiable
articles in their baggage when they
arrived on the Nippon Maru in July,
1902. after visiting the Orient.
CALL BUREAU, HOTEL BARTON,
WASHINGTON, June 27.â Reductions
in the rates of duty now charged by
the United States on importations of
Ilquor3 were announced to-day which,
it is estimated, will double the impor
tation of French absinthe alone, to say
nothing of other liquors and cordials.
The ruling affects all fancy drinks,
the most of which come from the Latin
countries. It follows the decision of
the customs board of appraisers of
New York recently announced, in
which it is declared that cordials im
ported from France are entitled to
much lower duty than that levied
upon them in the past-
Because of this decision the Treasury
Department to-day announced it had
decided that the same privilege was
deserved by Germany, Italy and Portu
gal, and that these countries may now
export their cordials, liquors, absinthe,
arrack, kirchwahser and ratafia into
the United States at a duty of $1 75
per gallon instead of $2 25 as before.
It is generally conceded that the new
ruling means a large increase in the
amount of cordials brought to this
country, as all retail dealers in this
class of liquors will now be able to
obtain them at a much lower price.

From the. Union. station the Jefferson-

Around this, just after temporary
organization, when the committees are
busy with their reports, Colonel Mar
tin will permit all the members of
marching clubs (and every one, as he
naively says,' can be a member of a
marching club on th:s occasion) to
pass, two by two, while the band plays
the huzza music of politics. "If it takes
till eleven at night, they'll all go
through,', 1 says Martin, and his round
face beams with pleasure at. the
thought of so: many people having their
era vlqg to see a .national political con
vention in session gratified. Of course,
though, this will' all be done by grace
of the National Committee. Colonel
Martin is an old time St. Louis law
yer.
ALL CAN Â£EE PROCEEDINGS. .
The crowd that will try to get a
view of the nominating body at the
Coliseum will be one of the greatest
that has ever sought admission to a
convention. Not only it is World's
Fair time, but a battle is promised
that it is worth any one's while to
swelter through. It will be a memor
able convention. The total seating
capacity of the structure where the
convention is to be held is not more
than 11,000, including delegates, al
ternates and the press representatives,
who are all on the main floor. AH
around the elliptical floor space rise
tiers of chairs for the spectators. The
structure is a part of what is known
as the St. Louis Exposition building
and has been used annually for the
horse show. As a comparison it may
be said that the Kansas City Coliseum,
where the preceding Democratic con
vention was held, seated 23,000 per
sons.
Colonel John I. Martin, the sergeant
at arms of the convention, attended
to the arrangement details. He has
had much experience in just this s6rt
of work and the National Committee
leaves it to him entirely. It knows he
can be depended upon. Aisles are so
arranged throughout the floor and
spectators' space and pasageways are
so arranged under the platform and
tiers of chairs that in all that tre
mendous throng there will be no
crowding, no jostling. Every one en
titled to a seat, no matter where It
may be, will be able to go to and
from it without inconvenience.
Colonel Martin has arranged one
feature that is entirely new and will
be his trea^. t0 the American public.
There will be thousands of persons
wildly anxious to see what a great
convention looks like, who will be un
able to get a card that will even per
mit them to look inside. There will
be members of marching cli'bs alone
from various cities to the number of
25.000 men. Martin intends that all
these people shall see the sight in the
Coliseum. He has left an aisle around
one-half of the floor space, running
next to the front row of spectators'
seats and leading from an entrance at
one end of the building to an exit at
the other, around back of the sections
set aside for the delegates and alter
nates. One following the courste of
this aisle will get a view of every part
of the interior. His eyes will rest on
the delegates, the speakers' stand
and the thousands of spectators.
LARGE CROWD EXPECTED.
There will be something doing when
the California delegation gets here.
The State's exhibit at the fair will re
cline in the shade for a few days.
The Californians are expected to ar
rive here at 5:30 on the evening of
July 1. They will be met at Hannibal,
Mo., by Lee A. Day of San Francisco,
who is connected with the National
Committee headquarters here in the
capacity of a stenographer. He will
lead them through the madding crowd
of World's Fair visitors, and those ex
pecting visitorsâ a still more numer
ous class â and escort them to the Jef
fersoii.
ST. L.OUIS, June 27.â Pretentious
headquarters have been selected for the
California delegation to the Democratic
National Convention. The reading
room at the right of the main entrance
to the Jefferson Hotel has been secured
for its use. This is a spacious room,
furnished with all the elegance de
manded in a modern, first-class hotel.
It will be handsomely decorated. The
simplicity that gave "Washington and
Jefferson good digestions isn't going
to be at home so you could notice it
when the California pledged Bourbons
begin doing politics for the man they
have decided should be President. This
candidate, William R. Hearst, has re
served the two top floors and t-.vo
thirtls of the next one in the Jefferson.
Manager Hay didn't think the top
f oors and the roof would be safe if
he grave him quarters any farther
down and opened them to the Califor
nians. There are ninety-two rooms in
the reservation. The California dele
gation will probably occupy some of
these apartments, as Hearst and his
stenographers will have a few to spare
and it would be a shame to have them
remain empty.
and Twelfth streets, is easiest reached
by the Market street cars, which
transfer to Twelfth, that is, easiest for
those who prefer - to j take a car. The
Exposition building, and this must in
no way be confounded with the world's
fair, is only two â or: three 1 minutes'
walk from the Jefferson..
The convention headquarters of . the
National Committee are on the first
floor of the Jefferson, rooms 117,. 118
and 119.= W. A. Deford of ..Iowa, as
sistant secretary, . has been in charge
since the rooms were secured. â¢

Martin Oakes, an ex-convict and
known to the police as the cleverest
tilltapper in the city, went into the
grocery and saloon of John Plath,
corner of Steiner and Ellis streets,
about 10 o'clock yesterday morning
and asked for a drink. Plath served
him with the drink and then walked
into the grocery to attend to a cus
tomer. When he returned to the sa
loon he saw Oatps coming from be
hind the bar. Ptath glanced quickly
at the till and saw that a sack con
taining $22 25 was missing. Oates
ran along Steiner street and Plath
started in pursuit. He overtook Oates
after running three blocks and later
turned his prisoner over to the police.

were kept busy yesterday explaining
the matter to Clerk Charles W. Fay

Another suit to prevent the award
of contracts for the supplying of but
ter and cheese to the State's insane
was commenced yesterdav In the Su
perior Court by the A. L. L.undy Com
pany. The proceedings last week were
against the board of managers of -the
asylum at Napa. Yesterday's suit,
nearly identical in its allegations, is
against the board of managers of the
ayslum at Stockton.
The court is asked to restrain the
authorities named from awarding the
contract for butter to Hilmer & Bred
hoff and that for cheese to Wheaton,
Pond & Harrold. The last named firm
was the one- to which the Xapa con
tract waa awarded. The complaining
company alleges that its* bids were the
lowest of eleven submitted for 10,000
pounds of creamery extra butter,
4 0,000 pounds of cold butter and
2500 pounds of cheese. It is averred
that the bid of Wheaton, Pond & Har
rold was unsigned and unidentified at
the time the bids were opened accord
ing to the advertisement on June 15
and that the ' bid ,,w-as not signed or
identified until after the bids of the
eleven other firms had been seen. The
plaintiff says that the State will lose
$500 if the contract is let according
to the award of the asylum managers.

and two were injured yesterday fore
noon. The dead msn was August Ar
mand. He was unmarried and lived
on Jackson street, between Montgom
ery and Sansome. W. A. Wilson was
severely bruised and received internal
injuries. He was removed to the City
and County Hospital. Henry George,
another laborer, received slight bruises.
The accident occurred at 141 Prospect
avenue, where the men were employed
by Charles Gish, a contractor, In mak
ing an excavation for a building. The
bulkhead had been propped with tim-
bers and it was necessary in the pro
gress of the work to remove the props.
There was no .thought of danger; for
it was believed that the cement facing
of the bulkhead was strong enough to
support the -/wjMEht of the earth be
hind It. But the , wall .yielded to the
pressure and crumbling Into thousands
of pieces fell upon the unfortunate
workmen. Spectators of the accident
said that there was not enough cement
in the bulkhead and that if there had
been present the proper proportion of

have stood.

years old.

fruit shipments. Therein It Is set forth
that "If the fruit is wisely selected
there ought to be returned a gold
medal for nearly every shipment."
The last lot of exhibits for the San
Francisco building goes on to-day. In
cluded In this lot are models of bat
tleships, photographs of San Francisco
and elsewhere and 10,000 canes made
of the bark of the redwood tree for
gratuitous distribution.
Vproducts of California from San Fran
cisco to the St. Louis Exposition, with
the exception of the fresh fruits and
sheaf grains that are to be sent on.
Up to June 5* the California commis
sioners had put on exhibition 3150
plates of California fresh fruits, rep
resenting eighty-seven varieties, in the
Horticulture building. It Is expected
that 1000 pounds of fresh fruit per day
will be forwarded from now to the
close of the exposition setison. As the
commissioners provide that the fruit
producers shall pay the expense of
sending on their own fruit for exhibi
tion purposes, it is possible that some
work will have to be done in the in
terior to collect the necessary supplies.
A rate of $3 50 per 100 pounds by
express has been made for the trans
portation of fruit.
FRESH FRUIT SHIPMENTS.
This means certainly that a round
million pamphlets are now in St.
Louis, have been distributed to peo
ple inquiring about California or are
ready to be shipped. To-day marks
the closing of the shipping of all
Fifteen tons of literature will be
shipped to-day from this city to the
California commissioners at the St.
Louis Exposition. More than ten tons
of this matter relates to the counties
lying south of Tehachapl. The re
mainder deals with the counties lying
north of the Tehachapi Pass. One
thousand copies of the California
State Board of Trade's annual report
are included. The shipment does not
by any means represent the total sum
of the literature with which California,
by counties", cities, boards of trade and
other organizations, has prepared to
enlighten the world concerning its
wealth and resources. J. W. Barry,
who is shipping _ the goods and ex
hibits to the California commission
ers'from this city, says that at least
ten tons of reading matter have pre
viously been sent on for gratuitous in
formation.
A MILLION* PAMPHLETS.
At the suggestion of Inspector Bolles,
Captain Irvine questioned Carey as to
who it was that said the captain hail
been notified about the doings in the
storeroom. Carey could not remember
the Quartermaster's name, but First
Officer Wilson gave it as Salingsy. Cap
tain Irvine said such a statement was
false, as not one word had been said to
him about It. He. had turned in at
8:30 that night, but got up at 3:30 in
the morning and as he stepped on the
deck he saw the storekeeper going into
the first officer's room and thought it
rather Queer. He at once summoned
the watchman and asked what was
going on and was told "nothing, "J to
which he replied, "That's a He. for
there has been something going on all
"That fs not eo," broke in Captain
Irvine. "He did ask me If he could
give a little dinner, but I did not tell
him he could Invite the steerage pas
sengers or the crew."
Although Carev had given the store
keeper orders .not to issue any, more
liquor, wine was served at a dipner
given Sunday night by First Officer
Wilson. Carey was told by Wilson
that he had asked the captain for per
mission to give the dinner and invite
the clergyman and his wife, who were
in the steerage, and also the first, sec
ond *nd third assistant officers, 'and
that the captain had given him permis
sion to do so.
After the ship had been beached and
the passengers and some of the crew
were ashore, Stevens sent out an order
for a keg of beer, but Carey would not
allow it to be taken ashore, as the
captain's name had been forged to the
order. . v
FORGED ORDER FOR BEER.
In direct contradiction of Storekeeper,
Stevens, Carey swore that none of the
officers were drunk, and, further, that
none of the engineers had taken any
strong drink of any kind
Sunday morning prior to the disaster,
and while the ship was still at anchor,
Carey gave orders to the storekeeper
not to Issue any more liquor to any
one, as he thought the thing had gone
far enough. In answer to a question
by Inspector Bulger he said he did not
know the mate was married until after
the ceremony had been performed, as
he had turned in, and was called by
the groom shortly after the knot had
been tied. Then it was that the dif
ferent officers repaired to the store
ro'^m and began to enjoy themselves,
quietly, very quietly. There was not
the least bit of noise, for if there had
been the captain would have known
it, as his room was directly overhead
and he was In bed. ,
Inspector Bulger wanted to know how
First Officer Wilson came to be charged
$74 for wine. Carey said that was the
bill handed to him by Storekeeper Ste
vens, and although he believed the bill
was excessive \^ilscn had told him to
pay il rather than make any fuss about
it. Carey said he had understood that
part of the $74 was for the services of
the minister who tied the knot which
caused the jollification.
Carey was not present when the first
hearing was held, hence Inspector Bul
ger informed him that the first officer
had testified that he paid the $74 for
liquors, and rather startled the witness
by saying: "We want the facts in this
case J We have been fooling long
enough." Carey proceeded to give the
nature* of the duties of the storekeeper,
and brought out the fact that that of
ficial was directly under the orders of
the purser. To his positive knowledge
there was no vhisky ordered during the
night. He had inspected the storeroom
and wineroom, and there were only
twenty quarts of wine on the ship
wh<*n she left San Francisco. To the
best of his knowledge there were eight
or nine quarts of wine and seven or
eight pints consumed up to the time
the ship was lost. Every one who saw
or heard of the bill for $74 considered
it excessive, but as Wilson had told
him to pay it. he did so without any
further question.
CONTRADICTS STEVEN'S.
A question of veracity arose when
Carey testified that the captain knew
of the drinking going on. as one of the
quartermasters had notified the mas
ter the day before putting to sea. -That
statement Captain Irvine emphatically
denied, and with such force that In
spector Bolles warned him to confine
his remarks to the case and avoid all
side issues and references.
QUESTION' OF VERACITY.
When former Storekeeper Harry G.
Stevens of the lamented Colon gets
back in ;>ort he may have to face a
charge of perjury, if the feelings dis
played by Purser George J. Carey, Mate
J. L. Wilson and Chief Engineer W. D.
E. Sullivan continue along the lines dis
played at the continued hearing into
the causes of the wreck of the steamer
April 10.
Purser Carey was on the "stand yes
terday morning before United States
Inspectors Bolles and Bulger, and ap
peared to have been familiar with all
that happened prior to the going ashore
of the steamer. As the man indirectly
in charge of the liquors on board the
Colon, he swore positively that there
was no drunkenness among the officers
or crew prior to the wreck. Under close
questioning by both Inspectors Carey
said there had been drinking on board
in honor of the marriage of First Of
ficer Wilson, but that the chief en
gineer had not taken anything stronger
than ginger ale, that he himself had
three or four glasses of wine, but was
not intoxicated. He was positive the
first officer was not drunk, nor even
affected by the two glasses of wine he
had taken. As to Chief Engineer Sul
livan, he swore positively that that of
ficer had not taken anything stronger
than ginger ale, and in all the years he
had known him he was positive that
Sullivan had never used intoxicants.
Aiftong the more notable of the paa
eens>rs who. arrived on the steamship
Sierra" yesterday was Hugo Gerald de
Bathe, sou and heir of General Sir Hen
ry Percival de Bathe of England, and
more familiarly known to the American
public as the second husband of Lily
Lanjjtry. Â¦â¢' He is accompanied by his
brother. Captain Max de Bathe, who
recently resigned from the British army
after " fifteen years' service, and Cap
lain* C IS. Davis, also of the British
army. The- trio came direct from Sa
*t,q4 for the purpose of securing proper
surgical attention for Hugo de Bathe,
Vhois suffering from a slight attack!
of ijjjobd jioisoning resulting from a tat- |
toolng operation performed by a native ;
iflasder- -during their visit to Pago :
Pa#a;
H-iigo de Bathe's body bears numer- j
ous artfuldesigns in india ink, imprint- j
*d uoon his skin by the clever tattooers
of various countries through which he j
h&s ' traveled during the last ten years. ;
One of his purposes in going to Sa
moa was to submit himself to a tattoo
ing er-eration, which was performed
upoR his. left leg. Later the limb
eweiled to such proportions and the
p^in from the operation became so in
tolerable that he was forced to seek
medical assistance upon one of the
American men-of-war lying In the har
bor of Pago Pago. It was plain to the
Burgeon who attended him that De
Bathe was suffering from blood poison-
Ing resulting from the use of an un
clean geedle, and he was advised to
hurry to this city, where he could re
ceive better attention. For a time it
Â¦was feared : that De Bathe's injury
might prove fatal. Arriving here yes
terday he was apparently in Rood
health, although he used a cane to as-
Fist him in his movements about the ;
Palace Hotel, where he and his fellow
travelers are staying.
It is his intention to place himself |
under the care of a surgeon here, and if
the latter can assure him that danger ;
of further trouble has passed he will <
Join his brother on a trip to the City
of Mexico, to which they have been in- '
vited by President Diaz.
H'jc-o de Bathe and Captain de Bathe
left England on their present tour
around the world shortly after Lily j
Langtry fnt^red on her recent theat
rical ensragpmpnt in this country. Th^y
drifted slowly across the oceans to the
South Sea Islands and were enjoying ;
themselves among the natives whon .
.Hugo was taken ill. â¢- â¢- : |

* Your wonderful medicine. " Favorite Prescrip-
tion;' has helped me greaUr ia time of suffer-
ing." writes Mrs. Miata wnsrfct, of Edwards,
Ind. "Last winter I was usable to do xay work,
was to be cocfined in February, and a lady in
Iliisoi* wrote and told me about your medicine.
I used three bottles of ' Favorite Prescription.'
end will say I had the easiest and quickest con-
fiseiaeet I tur had. Had three children be-
fore, and would snlfcr from twenty -four to thirty-
six hoars before birth, but this time only two
'bocn. Have a fine baby girl and Â«he is the
cost healthy one of all. ' I am still uaiaj the
' Ffcrerilc Prescription ' &s a tosic."
DB. PIEBCE'S ItEiaEIJEES.
The first Ies6on that the yoacg girl has
of womanhood is usually a painful one.
She learns to know what heaoache means,
&&d . backache, and sometinies is sadly
borne down by this new experience of life.
All the pain and misery which younjf
fjirls ctnatnonly experience at such a time
may, in almost every instance, be entirely
Â¦ prevented or cured by the use of Doctor
Pierce's Favorite Prescription. It estab-
lishes regularitT. It tones up the general
health, and cures headache, backache,
nervousness and other consequences of
womanly weakness or disease.
The anxious mother of the family often-
times carries the whole burden of responsi-
bility so far as the home medication of
common ailments of the Rirls or boys are
concerned. Toe cost of the doctor's visits
it very often much too great. At such
times the mother is invited to write to Dr. :
R. .V. Pierce, of Buffalo, N. Y., for medical
advice, which is given free. Correspond-
ence is held strictly confidential.
Sacked up by over a third of a century
or remarkable and uniform cures, a record I
such as no other remedy for the diseases !
and weaknesses peculiar to women ever j
attained, the proprietors and makers of Dr.
Pierce 's Favorite Prescription now feel
fully warranted in offering to pay $500 in
legal money of the United States for any
case of Leucorrhea, Female Weakness, Pro-
lapsus, or Falling of Womb, which they
cannot core. All the World's Dispensary
Medical Association, Proprietors, of Buf-
falo, tL Y., ask is a fair and reasonable
trial of their means of cure.

Professor Bernard Moses ' followed
with a review of the educational value
of summer schools and the educational
system' of the United States.
Professors Stephens concluded by
welcoming the students and the'visit
ing members of the faculty.. Of the
faculty he said it. was composed' of
some of the gre'atest minds, leaders of
the highest thought in the world, to
whom it would .be a privilege to lis
ten/' . : Â¦ â¢ .y Â¦ '
Professor Stephens â¢ warned the stu
dents not to undertake too much work
at- the session, on the ground that they
would'.suffer mental, indigestion. .Tak
ing one or two courses and applying
to them studiously, leaving the other
courses to visit merely as auditors he
said is the best way to achieve results.
"You jj must remember," continued
Professor Stephens, "that the functions
of a summer school are different from
the University. You may go to fifty
summer schools arid yet not get what
you .will from the university. Teachers
-come' here to' get in' touch with new
ideas and new methods^ They wish to
knowhow educational subjects are "be
ing handled. It is not so much a work
of learning as it is of stimulation and
direction. So be moderate and get
some real good out of the summer
school." ."
BERKELEY. June 27.â The summer
session was formally opened \ at the
University of California this morning.
When the Recorder's office was opened
at 8:30 o'clock there was a lo*ng line of
men and women waiting to register
as students. All day long the line
moved past the counters, while clerks
worked hard- taking names and en
rolling them in the great book. At
the closing this afternoon 701 students
had become enrolled. Recorder Sutton
says that another 150 will be added to
_this numb#r before the session Is over.
With the arrival of the faculty and
students the university campus has
taken on its wonted animated appear
ance. Excepting for the fewer num
bers moving between buildings in the
Intervals between lectures it looks the
same as. when the regular session is
on. The stYange faces among the fac
ulty attract the attention of everybody
and many inquiries are going about
the Eastern and European members.
Most interest centers in Professor de
Vries of Amsterdam and Professor Ar
rhenius of Stockholm, whose old-school
appearance and fame as scientists pro
voke inquiry from all.
The university' meeting this after
noon in Hearst Hall was the first func
tion of the session. There was a Jarge
audience there, which was eager to
hear words of wisdom dropping from
th<Â» lips of two speakers-r-Professor H.

Last night four thugs roaming about
Ictyra Park showed Roque C. Reyes,
3cion. of an aristocratic Filipino fam
ily, how the Mores of America do
things. The quartet decoyed Reyes to a
dark spot on the grounds near the
Japanese i tea garden and sifted his
pockets of every cent of his money,
amounting in all to about $5.
Like all of his countrymen, Reyes is
small in stature. Each of the four who
held him up seemed to him aa husky
as Jim Jeffries, and he saw that it was
useless to* resist. While they slipped
their fingers into his pockets he stood
perfectly still, and when they got
through he went his way.
.'"They got me while I was walking
around the Japanese tea garden," said
the victim to-day. "They told me they
would kiU me if I said a word/and I
kept still."

IN SUMMER DAYS
At ninety, and a great-grandfather.
Franz L. Llndermann of Alameda is
able to woo and wed. and to-day he
obtained a license to marry Fredericke

lotted three score and ten.
They were married by the Re"^. TV.

Llndercnann'3- home on Taylor avenue,
between Seventh and Eighth streets,
in Alameda. â¢ ~.vj
The courtship of the aged groom
was as well directed and brief a8 if
he had been a young man.
The pair met at a German picnic two
weeks ago. Lindermann has not been
getting alons very well with a mar
ried daughter and was feeling lonely
when he was introduced to the woman
who is now his wife. They sat and
watched the youngsters* dance and play
under the trees. This drew from them
reminiscences of other days, when un
der the lindens in the Fatherland they
indulged in like pastimes. The ac
quaintance of that afternoon ripened
and a few days later found Linder
mann making his first call on his
sweetheart of seventy-five.
Yesterday was the third Sunday the-y
spent together and to-day the mar
riage license was bought and the cere
mony performed. Each has somft
property and the couple are indepen
dent of the support of others.

Franz L. Lindermahn Wins
an Aged Bride After Brief
but Romantic Wooing
The usual preliminaries having been
disposed of there was a very short ex
ecutive session, and then the work of
the meeting vas rushed through in
short order. The necessary legal mo
tions were made to apply for places
upon the primary and regular tickets,
the primary election to be held on Aug
ust 9. The date of the convention was
fixed for August 16 at Vallejo.
Then came the all-important motion
â that delegates outside of the four
<ities where the primary law is manda
tory be appointed by the committee.
This motion was made by Dr. C. L.
Tisdale of Alameda and was seconded
by H. F. Stahl of Solano. There was
very little talking over the motion.
<"hairman Henshaw announced that- no
petition or request had been filed with
the committee for any other course. Dr.
Tlsdale said that this procedure was
usual for outside districts and the mo
tion was carried with but one vote
against it, that of Everett J. Brown.
<"hairman Hfr.shaw announced that
the commit teeman from each district
would bring the names of his delegates
to a meeting of the committee to be
held <>n Friday next at the same time
:\r,d plrce. The basis of apportionment

up at this mee.ii,;.
The Alamedi County Hoard oT Su
pervisors was in session this morning,
but n<j petition was presented to them
askinr that primaries be called in the
country districts.
No protest or petition was received
from State Senator G. R. Lukens or
his friends and the action of the com
mittee went without a challenge. There
was a conference of a number of Sena
tor Lukens' friends just prior to the
committee meeting. The conference
was purely informal and none of those
present at the little gathering appeared
at the meeting of the committee. There
was quite a gathering of those promi
nent in State affairs. They were look
ing for points, as the meeting will have
en important bearing upon the affairs
of the entire State. Contra Costa Coun
ty sent down quite a delegation, in
cluding State 'Senator C. M. Belshaw
and Superior Judge W. S. Wells. Sen
ator W. C. Ralston of Calaveras was
also present, with a large number from
Oakland. Alameda and Berkeley.
There wpre five absentees when
Chairman W. G. Henshaw called the
committee to order, one of whom was
not represented by proxy. W. H. Chick
ering has been ill for some time and
was not present and sent no proxy. W.
L. Crooks of Solano and C. L. Crellin
of Pleasanton are both in the East.
Mr. Crouks sent hie proxy to Dr. C. L.
Tisdale of Alameda and W. G. Hen
efcaw held that of C.^L. Crellin. John
Birmingham Jr. of Contra Costa Coun
ty gave his proxy to G. E. Milnes,
chairman of the Republican County
Central Committee of that county.
Those present were: Forty-seventh
Districtâ Dr. C. L. Tisdale and E. E.
Johnson; Forty-eighth Districtâ Rod
W. Church and Frank Barnett; Forty
ninth Districtâ Morris Flynn; Fiftieth
Districtâ Everett J. Brown: Fifty-first
Districtâ William G. Henshaw; Fifty
second District â George D. Metcalf;
Contra Costa Ccunty â James M. Stow;
Solano Countyâ H. F. Stahl.
The Republican Committee of the
Third Congressional District, compris
ing the counties of Alameda, Contra
Costa and Solano, to-day settled the
question of the manner of the selection
of delegates to the Congressional con
vention, and in doing so settled the
question of who should be the next Re
publican nominee for Congress. The
committee decided to appoint the dele
gates from the districts outside of the
cities of Oakland. Alameda, Berkeley
and Vallejo, and as nearly every mem
ber of the committee favors State Sen
ator Joseph R. Knowland it is a cer
tainty that he will be nominated.

"The Republican convention waa thft
most interesting thing I saw. It
brought together all the great minds
of the party, and I liked to study them.
I had intended to stay in Chicago two
days, but I lingered to get it all. Of
the speeches I think Mr. Knight's was
the best delivered and best understood.
The instant he began to talk the con
vention was all attention. It was such
a relief to hear him thunder. Mn
Black's speech was scholarly and epi
grammatic, and I should say that it
was an addition to English literature.
The only trouble was that it could not
be heard. Ellhu Root's speech I con
sidered one of the finest documents the
Republican party holds. It was a mas
terly effort and will be preserved."
President Wheeler's trip carried him
all over the East. At Brown Univer
sity, his alma mater, he attended the
dedication of a ,new hall built by his
fraternity. He could not attend the
convention of the National Educational
Association, -which is about to convene
at St. Louis, but saw President Butler
of Columbia University and delegated
to him the powers of president.
"I called on President Roosevelt. He
has not changed at all, but romplains
that he is taking on more flesh than
he wants to carry. This forces him to
take long walks in an effort to reduce
the tendency to obesity.
President Wheeler returned to the
University of California this afternoon
from his annual summer visit to the
East, having fulfilled to the letter his
plan to rejoin Mrs. Wheeler in Berke
ley on the anniversary day of their
wedding. During his five weeks' ab
sence President Wheeler met and was
entertained by men leading in the
thought and policies of the nation, of
whom he talked freely to an inter
viewer. He said:
Berkeley Office San Francisco Call,
2148 Center Street, June 27.
Justice Edgar said that when the
proper data is furnished him he will
issue a warrant, as binder ordinance
No. S2 it is a misdemeanor to cut down
street trees.
The women of the Town and Gown
Club are going to have somebody ar
rested for cutting down five trees on
Center street last week, thus destroy
ing some of the town's beauty. Just
whom the punishment will be visited
upon nobody knows, but . the club is
bound to have the law on the guilty
party. It may be Mr. Lindgren and
it may be Mr. Hicks of the firm of
Lindgren & Hicks, contractors, for it
is one of the members of the firm who
is said to have committed the deed.
To say that the Town and Gown
Club is indignant over this alleged
desecration is ' giving employment to
the mildest term in the dictionary. No
doubt some of them would like to tear
the eyes out of the man or men who
cut down those five trees. It would be
a brave man who could muster up
courage enough to confess, like the
Father of his Country, that he did It
with his little hatchet.
It is a criminal offense to cut down
trees in Berkeley. The destroyer may
be fined as much as $100 or sent to
jail for 100 days. Perhaps if the de
stroyer knew the penalty he would not
have taken the risk. At any rate the
Town and Gown members have dug
up an old ordinance bearing: on the
subject and by way of protest against
any more ruthless tree cutting they
intend to prosecute either Mr. Lind
gren or Mr. Hicks. It will be an ex
ample to somebody.
The civic section of the Town and
Gown Club Â»has. taken the initiative.
Mrs. Alan G. Freeman, chairman of
the- section, and Mrs. Frank Howard
Paine, "a member, went before Justice
Edgar this afternoon and applied for
a warrant for the arrest of one of the
firm of Lindgren & Hicks. There was
a flaw in the proceedings, however, for
the complainants could not say which
one of the firm is responsible for the
deed^and a postponement until to-mor
row was advised. Mrs/Freeman said:
. It was a fhamÂ« to cut those trees down and
somebody will be pun'.stfed. There Is a town
ordinance that forbids cutting trees on the
Ftreetr. - A great many people are indignant
ovfr the desecration. The whole Town and
tsow-n Club Is Interested in thte matter and so
is the North Berkeley Improvement Club, which
has delt-frated Mr. E. J. Martin to assist us In
the proFecution cf the vandals.
The trees stood on Center etreet, in front of
the schoot property that was lately leaned
for building purpose*. The trees were great,
spreading menarchs that made the street beau
tiful. . Nobody thought they were to be cut
down and noboCy protested while the \ andal- 
ifiti was going on. It is a shame, but 1 wish
to repeat that somebody will be punished for it.

The defense introduced letters from

that there was neither money nor pass
for her. Then a' newspaper was pro
duced showing that the woman had
been arrested in Joplln, Mo., while sit

that this was the. reason he had in re
turn refused a reconciliation.
Jennie R. Cassell, a pretty young wo

EUREKA, June 27.â The damage done
to the plant of the Eureka Lighting
Company by last night's conflagration
has proved less serious than was an
ticipated. The corrugated iron parti
tion separating the furnace-room from
the dynamos confined the i fire to the
room in which it started. The fire de
partment spared no effort to keep the
fire from spreading to the dynamo
room. The dynamos were all covered
to protect them from the heat.
This morning it was discovered that
the machinery outside of the furnace
room was all in perfect condition. The
cars of the Humboldt Transit Com
pany, which receives its electric power
from the lighting company, began run
ning at 3 o'clock to-day. The lights in
the business places and residences were
all turned on this evening. Most of the
lights were run by the sub-station, and
would not have been interfered with
had the fire been more serious.
It is thought that J5000 will cover the
damage. The only business concern
that will be affected by the fire is the
Occidental Mill Company, which plant
will be shut' down for a few days until
the pipes leading from the mill to the
electric plant can be repaired. The 'city
at large will suffer no inconvenience
whatever.

SAN" LUIS OBISPO, June 27.â Five
prominent young men were arrested
here to-day on a charge of disturbing
the peace, and it is believed the exam
ination will lead to further and more
serious charges.
Last Saturday night about 9 o'clock
A. J. Hill, a Southern Pacific brake
man, was chatting with Miss Antoin
ette Lamy on her mother's doorstep in
this city, when Sam Cook and George
Faulkner came along and spoke insult
ingly to the couple. Young Hill re
sented the Insult and the boys went
Â¦-away. Shortly after they returned
with three comrades and renewed the
insults. Seeing that he could have no
peace, Hill bade his sweetheart adieu,
after pr6mising her to avoid trouble.
Hill went into the street, passed his
five adversaries and was again insult
ed. '. He turned and faced one of the
young men and received a blow on the
head. Then he was knocked Insensi
ble. â¢ A moment later Mrs. Lamy came
upon the scene and saw the five young
men by the moonlight peering into the
face of the reviving brakeman. ' The
assailants disappeared and Hill was
cared for and sent to the Railroad
Hospital in San Francisco by the next
train. Hill's Injuries consist, besides
bruises, of a compound fracture of the
left ankle, from which it Is stated he
cannot recover for some months. The

SALT LAKE, June 27. â Charles
Sherwin and Montgomery Fisher,
prominent young men of Salt Lake,
quarreled over a woman and fought a
vicious fight with bare knuckles to set
tle the dispute. The fight took place
this afternoon. Sherwin was the chal
lenger. He is an Englishman and con
strued a joking remark made by
Fisher to be an insult and demanded
satisfaction. When asked to name
weapons he chose boxing gloves, and
the pair at once adjourned to a local
gymnasium.
The police got a tip. raided the placa,
and prevented the fight.
Sherwin and Fisher then agreed to
meet at a point across the Jordan
River, west of the city, and were driven
there with about a dozen friends, who
acted as seconds. The gloves had been
forgotten, bo the two men stripped to
the waist and went at it with bare
fists. They agreed to fight to a finish
and objected to the efforts of their
friends to 8top the mill, which soon
became a wicked one.
Almost every blow was damaging.
Both men were knocked down within
a minute and they were soon bathed
in each other's blood. Again and
again the friends endeavored to per
suade them to call it off, but the fight
ers steadily refused and kept at It until
both fell from exhaustion. They were
carried to the Jordan River, bathed
and their injuries dressed.
Sherwln's head was one mass of
bruises. His lips were cut and swollen
and both eyes were black. Fisher has
an ear torn, a black eye and a large
swelling on his cheek. Both, are In bed
under the care of a doctor to-night.
% The men had been friends prior to
the fight and lived in the same apart
ment-house.

In speaking of this Judge Greene
said: "A number of Judges held
when the present divorce law
went into effect that the provision for
holding up the judgment for a year
was unconstitutional. Judge Rhodes
of San Jose wrote an opinion, in
which a number of others concurred,
I among them. In this case I granted
an absolute decree. Here was one
error. The judgment entered was not
such as provided for, and there was
another error. I am not prepared to
say offhand whether that decree can
be changed or not. The time for ap
pealing from it has passed and that

Far out in^ the sea about midway
between Cape Horn and the Cape of
Good Hope there is a little island
called Tristan da Cunha. Almost en
tirely separated from ' the external
world, the annual visit of an English
warship, which conveys the news from
the rest of civilization, is the greatest
event during the year in the life of
the inhabitants. The Tristaneans, who
number some seventy-five souls, are
descendants of an English non-com
missioned officer, Glass by name, ivho,
when the island was depopulated of
its native dwellers some eighty years
ago, received permission to remain.
Lately an English officer was ordered
by his Government to make a propo
sition to the Tristaneans to emigrate
tp the Capeland, where they v/ould re
ceive a much larger area of land. The
official has now received their answer.
In which they state that while they
are deeply grateful to the Government
for Its kindly interest in their well be
ing, they feel obliged to decline the

For her cats, when in health, the
Queen has prescribed a diet of fish
nnd milk, and as she Is quite unwilling
to trust the discrimination of the ordi
nary London milkman as to the qual
ity of the latter the royal cats are fed
on milk which comes fresh from Sand
ringham every morning, while a fish
dealer of repute is intrusted with the
supply of the fish known to be the
best for feline consumption. When

tastes or habits. She was also ignorant
of the points of the different breeds,
but Louis Wain, whom she had pre
sented to her for the purpose, was
able to convey so much information
that now the Queen can discuss cats
with the greatest expert in Europe.
Now that the Queen has gone in for
cats, society, ever eager to 'follow a
royal lead, is sure to take up the fad
and puss will be in clover for some
time to come. In fashionable circles
there are, however, already. many cat
devotees.' Most conspicuous among
thern is Lady" Marcus Boresford, foun
der of the Cat Club. She possesses
what Is said to be the finest "cattery"
in the world, in which something like
150 cats of the ; choicest breeds, from
the tailless Manxman to the bushy
tailed chinchilla, live in a veritable
feline paradise. "Many of them reside
in a picturesque, creeper-clad building,
known in the neighborhood as "Cat
Cottage." Here no expense has been
spared in adapting the rooms to their
requirements, and the most elaborate
provisions are made for warmth and
ventilation. One room is set apart for
a woman, who is held responsible for
the conduct of the establishment. A
small kitchen is provided for prepar
ing the meals of the cats. On the
walls are racks to hold the white
enameled bowls and plates in which
their food is served. Variety is con
sidered an essential part of their
dietary. One day their, principal meal
consists , of appetizing , bowls' of fish
and rice. On another their fastidious
palates are regaled with mincemeat
of the choicest quality, .in hot weather
a good deal . of vegetable matter is
mixed with their food. For liquid re
freshment they, have an abundance of
Swiss milk. Some goats, too, are kept
on the premises to furnish milk for
young and delicate kittens. A medi
cine chest is at hand, which contains
everything that is needed for prompt
and efficacious treatment in case any
cat becomes sick.

â¢ In his review of the progress achieved by the va
rious organizations composing the union the president
said the growth of the movement as a whole amounted
"almost to a social miracle." Even the most adverse
conditions of industry and of politics have never checked
the steady progress of the societies. . Statistics were
given showing that the business of the last fiscal year,
for which full returns were in, reached a total of
89,216,223 pounds sterling. It was added that the so
cieties are to-day transacting a far larger yearly turn
over than the - whole export trade of Great Britain
amounted to when the movement commenced. They
had now 2,116,127 members registered in 1701 societies,
and probably each* member represented in most cases
a family.
A notable feature of the work of the societies is the
amount of money devoted annually to education and to
charity. It appears that the founders of the original
associations aimed at mutual helpfulness in every direc
tion, and from the first adopted rules devoting 2J4 per
cent of all profits to educational and charitable uses.
These rules have been maintained unbroken, and as a
consequence .the union devoted last year 78,499 pounds
sterling to education~and 45,649 pounds sterling to
charity. At the present time there are about 800 cen
ters where co-operative educational funds are 'being
administered by committees numbering altogether % about
10,000 persons.
Concerning the programme of future work the presi
dent said: "With all that had been done the co
operators were only at the beginning of their, work.
They had *to house their members in places of
the name of home; to carry co-operation to the reach of
the very poorest; . to adapt it to the needs of depressed
agriculture; to bring the rural laborer back to. hope; to
conquer the heart of London, where only one in 250
people were co-operators; to introduce art into their
work; to wipe out all stain of corruption of their em
ploycs-by their tempters; to reverse the policy which
shut out capital from flowing into their movement with
full measure; to "get labor back to the land, and to
give their people city gardens and garden cities. The
admirable work of their women's guilds had to be fur
ther'developed, and the links which bound them to'co
operatprs in other lands had to, be strengthened."
i That is I certainly an ambitious platform, but the
great successes of the past justify the hopes of those
who expect greater things in the future. Certainly there
is nothing impracticable in the plans outlined, and al
most the whole programme may be carried out in a
comparatively few years by the force which seems to
be inherent in earnest co-operative endeavor.
FOR a long time past co-operative societies in Great
Britain have commanded the attention of econo
mists and of sociologists by reason of the rapidity
of their growth, the increasing magnitude of business
done and the almost uniform success attained by them
year after year. The most sanguine hopes of the found
ers of the first associations of the kind have been more
than fulfilled, and reports submitted at the recent annual
congress of the Co-operative Union show that the
movement has by no means reached its limit, but is stfll
going forward with the same extraordinary vigor that
marked its early stages.

This is a grand prize in the lottery of
the excavator, Just such a prize as the
Louvre or the British Museum would
like to draw, since neither In their mar

the many museums of Italy, is its equal
to be found. Twenty-five, perhaps thir

long-forgotten fashion in war lain be

parts under the bronze rotting slowly
away, the weight of the earth above
gradually crushing in the shell, and
only the protective layer of oxidation
on the surface of the bronze prevent

wheels and pole. Near it lie two curv
ing sheets of metal, all that remains
of the wooden yoke with bronze cov
ering platea. and in a dish a shimmer
ing mass of ivory flakes hint3 of a rail
that graced the curving front.
In such a car, so small, yet so lavish

deftly fitted bronze reliefs, may Lara

many a triumph which the narrow
pride of Roman historians has sup

The relic was found last year in a

were best preserved by their sheathing
of bronze, but elsewhere the wooden

the fronts and side wings of thin

JN every town in the agricultural States of the East
there are cash buyers of wheat, corn, oats and the
staple field crops and of live stock. The seller is
made aware of the state of the market every day. Me
knows the freight on his product, and therefore has the
means of knowing whether the buyer's offer is right or
not. Under such circumstances the farmers who wish
to sell for cash at that day's offer dispose of their prop
erty. If any wish to. hold for a higher price they hold.
In such case they become speculators in. their product,
and may win or lose, like all speculators.
The' California fruit growers need such a system of
marketing. They cannot become speculators by holding,
for the product is too perishable. But they need a daily
cash market in which they will meet the buyers and
from which they will take the cash home for that day's
transaction. Under the present commission system the
producer takes undue risk. He must in the nature of
things take the risk of wind and weather. He must fight
the insects and fungi which attack his crop, and in ad
dition he must take all the risk of shipment. .-'
As a shipper his risk is the greatest. The commission
man takes jione of it. The producer must pay the
freight, the commission, and lake what he can get, for
the buyer is 2000 miles away and does as he pleases
with the producer's property when it gets within his
reach." It :s obvious that if the producer get, throughout
the fruit harvest, the lowest average price that pays
him a profit at all, he is better off at the end of the sea
son than if he take all the risk and s pay.all the freight
and commissions and stand all the loss, as he is com
pelled to under the present system.
As citrus fruit was the first and is the oldest of our
orchard industries it is proper that it should lead in this
conspicuous reform in the method of marketing our
fruit. The effort to merge the whole citrus industry in
the control of one organization has resulted in forming
the citrus union, which includes the product of the
whole State. We are unable to say, from the facts now
made public, whether this organization has been success
ful in including all of the producers. But there is.evi
dence that it includes a majority of them, and if its wise
ly laid plans are as wisely carried out it will surely de
serve the allegiance of every grower, an'd will no doubt
get it.
Its prospectus has been issued and we repeat this
part of it, 1 which expresses the whole policy by which it
intends to be governed: ''It will be the policy of the
California Citrus Union to advocate and secure as many
cash buyers to buy their fruit in California as possible.
In order to do this we shall use every effort to adver
tise to the Eastern dealers that they can buy the fruit
at a fair price by paying cash in California. It will also
be our policy to sell free on board. California, usual
terms, which means with privilege of inspection by the
buyer at the other end. This was the method operated
by the successful shippers during the most prosperous
periods, and proved to be the most successful method.
It was, in fact, the method which gave and always will
give support to all markets, : regardless of the plan of
selling.
"The California Citrus Union will establish in every
Eastern market a personal representative of experience
to look after the interests of our growers. These
agents will be constantly soliciting the buyers to pur
chase the fruit free on board, California, for cash, or
free on board, California, usual terms. They will be
able to make inspection and report upon the arrival of
all cars, thereby doing away with the probability of the
buyer making unjust rejections."
That seems to us to efficiently safeguard the interests
of the producer. The California citrus crop has estab
lished its market in the East. The consumers there re
quire it and must seek it of the Eastern dealers. These
naturally try to get possession of it at the lowest possi
ble rate, and they do this often by means that are very
unfavorable to the interests of the producer. When the
whole crops is kept in hand by the agencies of the pro-,
ducer untif the f buyer presents ihmself, the margin
heretofore left for the tricks of the trade disappears,
and a market is made solely on the merits of trie
product.
When the buyer finds that he must face the agent of
the producer, and that tricks of inspection are no longer
possible, and that the price he must pay includes the
cost of the system by which the producer safeguards
his interests, there appears at, once an inducement." for
the buyer to economize by meeting the producer face
to face in California, and paying) him cash in hand for
his property. When that system appears the California
citrus grower will be in the same position enjoyed by
the Eastern farmer.
When this system is installed in the citrus industry,
it will necessarily follow : in the case of our deciduous
fruits. When the season opens the buyers will meet
the producers and the fruit planter will get his cash for
each dayVi shipment and there his risk ceases. The
buyer is the middleman between the producer and the
consumer. At present the middleman takes no risk.
The producer takes it all. This docs not. mean only the
natural risk of transportation, but the risk of chicane and
dishonesty in the distant inspection and the method of
selling. In his^shipment there may naturally be a bad
box that has "whiskered" in transit. It is known to be
a fact that all the rest, of a lot entirely sound and ex
cellent is rated with the one bad box. and the middle
man, who by a third party as agent is perhaps the
actual buyer, gets the wjiole lot practically for nothing,
because inspection stopped at the one damaged box,
and the producer pays him his sevea per cent commis
sion and the freight. . â¢ .â¢ â¢ , .. Â¦
The beginning of reform will be" the ; formation of a
deciduous fruit union on the lines of the citrus union,
with an inspector at each Eastern Â» terminal, who will
make this' inspection fraud impossibje. As soon as the
middlcmeij are thereby compelled to, adopt legitimate
methods it will be to their interest to buy and pay cash
in California, and then his undue risks will be lifted off.

now -holds for being a college for, study on liberal lines;
the reduction of the number of units required for the
term's work strengthens the stand she has made for a
full four-year course.
The alterations that" Princeton has made in entrance
requirements and in the grouping of studies given in
her various coheres has significance to the educational
world, for it show^ that' the very liberal spirit born in
the Western colleges and State universities has begun
to take root ir>-ine older and more conservative institu
tions of eststflis-hed prestige. The break from the iron
clad rule' 01 classicism in college education came not
from the oldest of bur universities, but was the inspira
tion of growing colleges in the Mjddle West and on our
own Pacific Coast. When first it began to be recog
nized that a university had a place for the study of
bridge construction as well as the scansion of the bu
colics'of Virgil the revolt against the rigid adherence
to the standards of the English universities was vig
orously fought out all along* the line until now the new
idea has triumphed almost completely and the erst
while adherents to the old are themselves setting the
pace for progress.
It is a fortunate thing that Princeton has emphasized
its position in the matter of the four-year course and
has not been led into the extremely radical position
taken by Chicago University. A three-year course â
or rather the option of a three-year course such as ob
tains at the institution by the lake â is, in the minds of
most educators, putting a college course on too busi
ness-like a footing. That a young man. by denying
himself vacations and exerting himself to his utmost,
should be able to race through a college curriculum is
surely. too hard: and materialistic a thing to be termed
an academic training. That smacks too much of the
rapid correspondence school method of- education.
Freedom in the selection of studies and great latitude
in the choice of a general trend of academic endeavor
probably has no better illustration of its practicability
and sound principle than in our own two universities,
California and Stanford. In the latter especially 7 does
the latitude allowed "in these matters reach the high
plane of liberalism. In both institutions the beneficial
influence of this enlightened order of things is making'
yearly stronger justification for its adoption.

Xine suits were filed in the Superior
Court yesterday by as many heirs of
the estate of Hugh McDermott, who
died in San Mateo County on January
9, 1890. The action is brought against
James Maguire, as administrator of
the estate of Bridget McDermott, and
demands the payment of sums ranging
from $1000 to $5000 to each of the
plaintiffs on the ground that they did
not get all that was -coming to them

the administratrix of her husband's
will and it is alleged that before she
died she secured a settlement and dis
tribution of rhe estate. by false repre
sentations to the San Mateo Superior
Court. .
The heirs declare that she reported
to the court that McDermott's estate
consisted of ?6030 in realty and six
teen promissory notes, secured by.
mortgages worth $16,472 26. When
she obtained a decree of final settle
ment she was awarded three-fourths
of the estate and given $2500 in trust
for a legatee, leaving 51592 to be dis
tributed among the nine heirs, who
had been beruieathed sums ranging
from $700 to $5000.

Member? of the congregation have no
fear of ability to raise the amount
necessary, as the order has grown from
a rr.emhership of 5 in Ii95 to 700 at
the present time. At first meetings
were held in private houses, and as the
membership, increased halls were hired
to accommodate the weekly gather
inf-s. Steinway Hall is the present
place of meeting, and it was there the
plans for an edifice worthy of the sect
were ajrreed upon last Sunday.
In February. 1901, the lot at Scott
and Sacramento streets was purchased
and an order given John Galen How
ard, the architect, to prepare plans. The
plans submitted were in keeping with
the desires of the managers, but It waa
found that the lot was not large
enough to accommodate the building
contemplated. An additional 22:6 feet
on Sacramento street was purchased,
brirjrin? the total cost of the ground
up to ?23.30O.
Plans for the buildins to be erected
at the southwest corner of Scott and
Sacramento streets for the First
Church of Christ, Scientist, have been
approved and the construction will be
gin n.s -?oon as funds are accumulated
to warrant the laying: of the -corner

description of the wonderful scenes
and life of the country. The Rev. Mr.
Bevier presided.
A review of a journey East and the
condition of the Congregational church
in the Eastern part of the States com
posed an address by the Rev. Dr. C.
R. Brown before the Congregational
Ministers' Association yesterday morn
ing. Dr. Brown informed his audience
that there had come a change in the
attendance at the old churches of their
denomination in Xew England, which
he. attributed to" the strenuous life of
men who took the Sabbath for outdoor
recreation, and. also, because of the
circulation of secular ar\d senii-secular
Journal?.
The Christian Church Ministera* As
sociation met yesterday afternoon,
when the Rev. P. C. Macfarlane was
elected president of the association for
the next half year. The Rev. T. A.
Boyer was elected vice president and
W. F. Stafford treasurer and secretary.
Dr. Van Kirk announced that re
markable progress had been made in
the construction of the Christian
church building in Berkeley.
A Yogi, explained Dr. Scott, is one
who seeks to entirely obliterate all his
faculties and senses by acts of pen
ance, but both Christian Science and
Yogism, he said, are repugnant to the
higher instincts of mankind.
In reply to a question as to the con
nection between Christian Science and
the Vedant philosophy, as believed in
India, Dr. Scott replied that "there is
a very apparent similarity between
them, in that both teach the funda
mental doctrine that there is nothing
real in pain and that by. mental
abstraction and Yogi practices there
may be entire exemption from all hu
man ills.
DOCTOR IS QUESTIONED.
These priests have come to America. wh?re
very slliy women have been greatly Influenced
by them. a3 has been graphically depicted in
a booklet 'called 'â¢The Little Green God."
S'.ar.i Vivekananda. who made a stir at the
Parlicment of Religions in Chicago, and in
many other cities of America, and waa feted
bv many ladles in high social circles, was
Â¦either Igr.orast of the true Inwardness of the
religion he so jealously tried to prcpasate in
America cr else he purposely sought to de
ceive these who attended his lectures.
Oth;r pundits, otherwise religious teachers,
have since, visited America arrayed in their
mognlficeut y*llow priestly robes and with
great fluency of speech have nought by their
teaching cf occult science to make disciples.
There !Â» danger in all this, and no one with
a knowledge of Oriental religloa3 would for a
moment listen to such visionary and Imprac
ticable rubbish.
Sensible people must know that a re!r?ioa
practically so corrupt as the Krishna cult U
not wcrthy of credence by any p-x>p!e, and that
ths so-called occult Â»elesce. cr thsosophy. has
no practical Influence whatever In raisins the
pÂ«opl-?, !n the very land of Its origin, to a
htzh-rr plane of moral lif-f.
A CORRUPT RELIGION.
In view at these factÂ£. well known to any
one who has lived in Muttra, it seems sur
prising that any one Â«h<rc!d endeavor to spread
abroad as wurtfcy of b^tne accepted the doc
trine and teachings of the Krishna cult, as has
been done br Mrs.* Besant, Madame Blaratsky.
Swami Vlvekananda and others.
Many of the modern priests are looked upon
as the incarnation-s of Krishna and are wor
shiped with licentious rites and the people,
through toe teachings of theaÂ« prtists. have
become corrupt In thought aad practice.
"Unveiled Hinduism" was the suh-
Ject of a spiritual address by the Rev.
Jefferson E. Scott before the members
of the Methodist Ministers* Association
yesterday morning at Epworth Hall.
Dr. Scott is the presiding elder of
the Ajmere district, India, and his de
sire yesterday was to show the cor- i
ruption of the Krishna cult. , He con- j
demned those of America who give It i
a serious thought. Dr. Scott said in*
part:
Hinduism Las deteriorated Into the worship
of many sods, and among these may be men
tioned Rarn and Krishna. The latter was. bom
in Miiitre. a city situated on the Jumna River
thirty mlÂ«ra above Asm.
The modern form of Krishna worship^ Is the j
tnest corrupt form of Hinduism. Krishna. Â¦
hlT.self. had more than 1Â«.C*Â» wives.
The prosecution of the case of Jacob
Eppinger, charged with fraudulently
obtaining money from the Inter
national Banking Corporation, spent al
' most the entire day yesterday in try
| ing to connect the transaction when
money was borrowed from the Inter-
I national with other alleged fraudulent
Â¦ dealings. Attorney Campbell had prom
ised Judge Lawlor that all the evi
dence would be in by last night that
' the defense might begin its case this
; me ruing. As, however, almost the en
tire day was occupied in the examina
tion of one witness. Judge Lawlor sug
gested that night sessions be held in
order that the case may be finished
; before the dawn of the millenium.
. MA.VY QUESTIONS ASKED.
The first witness called was Josua
Eppinger. who failed to answer to his
; name last week. Josua, the defense
claimed, knew all about the disappear
; ance of the books from the Pacific
Coast Warehouse Company at the time
; of the Eppinger failure and his testi
'. mony proved that the surmise was
| correct. The following line, of ques
! tioning shows the situation:
Do you Keow Junes Demies?

! books oÂ£ th* Pacific Coast Warehouse Ccin

, p!r.rÂ«r. - ,
Where are they enr?
I believe he stilt has them.
The defense f i not care i to cross- <
examine and the witness was excused. !
A. L. Black, cashier of the London â¢
: and San Francisco B&nk, next took j
the stand. He told of the various deal- j
ings Jacob Eppinger had had with the i
bank, both as to borrowing money on â¢
%vheat receipts and buying drafts, se- j
cured by bills of lading, warehouse re- :
! cefptÂ« and insurance policies. The ;
; bank had never to his knowledge re- !
i ceived any w heat or barley for the re- ]
i ceipts. He could not without referring
I to the books of the bank teil if money
| Sorrowed by Eppinger had been repaid,
j but kne*r that certain promissory notes i
had been renewed.
RECEIVED XO GRAIX.
On croFS-examination by Mr. Ach the ;
witness said he did not know that any â¢
demand had ever been made for grain i
cr for the payment on the- promissory \
notes. On redirect examination the '
witness recalled one occasion in which |
he took an active part in the negotia
tfoa of a loan with the defunct firm. \
j but never investigated as to whether :
the grain existed or not, taking the :
warehouse receipts as absolute evi- j
dence.
'Did Jacob Eppinger ever say why I
he wanted to exchange warehouse re- i
ceipts already placed with you for j
others?" asked Mr. Camnbell.
"Xo. '
"Kow much money did he owe the ,
bank with which rou are connected on ;
June 1, 1503. and by what wheat re- I
ceipts was it secured?"
CONNECTING LINKS.
This cuestion was objected to and in j
explanation Mr. Campbell said:
"We wish to show there was not one j
kÂ»rne! of that wheat in the warehouse
at that time. We contend that they!
took advantage of this bank when they j
were gambling on the future. They j
owed the bank at that time $100,000 >
and their transactions with it were
part of a scheme to defraud."
L. D. Stephens, president of the Bank I
of Woodland, was examined next. He !
told cf bavins: made loans to the firm j
of Eppinger & Co. and identified sig- j
matures or. documents.
The case goes on at 9:30 this morn- !
ing.

The prodigal son's body is yet in the

Immediately send the San Francisco
ctiorneys full particulars.
OTTAWA, Ont., June 27Â«â Chief of
Government Detectives Sherwood to
day received a letter from a San Fran
cisco legal finn Inquiring for Samuel
Larsen, who Is wanted as an heir to
considerable valuable property near
that city.
The inquiry comes too late. After
Â¦working as a common laborer for years
Lsirsen lately started driA-lng for J. RÂ»
Booth, the millionaire lumber Â» king.
"While backing a wagon full of dirt
into a river he disappeared and has
Â¦r.ever since been heard of. It is thought
lie fell out of the wagon and Avas
drowned. He had a weakness for drink
and though occasionally he received
meney from rich American relatives he
vould ne\'er diA-ul&e their names.
CHICAGO, June 27.â Coming as if
from the dead, after he had been re
ported as murdered, and after his wife
had been held by the police several
days on suspicion of knowing some
thing of her husband's disappearance,
Stefan Biszak has unexpectedly re
turned to his old home.
When a body weighted with railroad
iron was taken out of the Illinois and
Michigan canal May 13, it was identi
fied by Mrs. Biszak as that of her hus
band, who had disappeared some time
before. Finally she Avas placed under
arrest as apparently the body Avas that
of a man who had been murdered. The
most rigid investigation by the police,
coA-ering several days, failed to estab
lish any eA'idence to connect the woman
Avith the murder, and as she showed
that she was in error as to her first
identification she was released.
The return of Biszak, who says he
has been in St. Paul, deepens the mys
tery surrounding the tylentity of the
body found in the canal and the man
ner of that man's death. The police
belieA-e there is no doubt the man Avas
murdered, but the body and its secret
ha\-e been buried in the potter's field.
Mrs. Bissak was startled when Bis
zak appeared at the door and for a
moment refused to belieA-e he Avas her
missing husband. Then there was an
affecting greeting and an explana
tion.
The majority recommendation of
Supervisors Boxton and McClellan of
the Police Committee that the Hayes
Valley Club be granted the August
permit for a professional boxing exhi
bition was not considered by the
Board of Supervisors yesterday. The
matter was referred to the commit
tee owing to the receipt of communi
cations from two rival clubs.
The Shasta Club sent a communica
tion to the board waiving any claim
to the August permit. The club stat
ed that its action Is prompted by the
fact that the Tosemite Club, which
had arranged to bring off a contest In
June was prevented from doing so by
accident and unless given the oppor
tunity during the month of August
will be put to the loss of a large
amount' of money.
Harry Corbett of the Yosemite Club
filed a petition for the August permit,
claiming that the club had paid the
license fee of 5 1200; that It has de
posited a bond of $2500 to give its
exhibition in August, and that ar
rangements â¢ were .made in the belief
that the rule of the board granting
permits to clubs In rotation, which
has been in operation for five years
past, would be followed.
Supervisor Boxton said the .clubs
would be given a hearing, but he ques
tioned the right of one club transfer
ring its alleged privilege to another
club.
Harry Foley, the local middle-weight,
returned from the East Sunday night.
He had several meetings in Philadel
phia and while here will try to ar
range a try-out with Twin Sullivan.
After enjoying for months popular
adulation in a land where there Is no

buses and restaurants declined to feed
him.
Taylor was a passenger on the Sierra.
During his long stay In Australia he
was the star attraction at many im
portant meetings. He won all the prizes
in sight and was much made of wher
ever he went. Australia Is a sport
loA-ing land and the good performer In
any line of sport Is the popular Idol,
whether his skin be white, black or
yellow. Taylor was extensively enter
tained. He was the guest of people
who stand high in Australia's social
life. He made lots of money and ac
quired the best-that-money-can buy
habit to the full extent of his ample
means.
After months of life under these con
ditions It was something of a jar when
he climbed Into a hotel bus at Pacific
street wharf yesterday, to be Invited
to step out. Another bus was tried.
Same result.
"No use taking you up; there will
be no room for you at the hoteV was
the invariable answer to the cham
pion's demands for an explanation.
Police Sergeant Mahoney went to
Taylor's rescue and gave him the
names of several hotels where colored
guests- are received.
The suggestion was not received
kindly.
"Not my kind of hotels." said the
wheelman, dismissing the policeman
with a haughty glare.
Taylor had intended ,to stay In the
city for some days, but late yesterday
afternoon purchased his ticket for last
night's overland. "When he secured his
transportation he said that not only
could he get no room for himself and
wife at any hotel where he would care
to stay, but that at no restaurant
where he would care to eat would any
body take his order.

CHICAGO, June 27. â The unexpected
happened in the steeplechase at Haw
thorne to-day, when Donami, the out
sider at 20 to 1, won all the way and
beat out the "good thing," Cardigan,
by a neck. The latter Avas played for a
killing, pounded from 10 to 1 down to
5% . at post time. Sweet Jane,
played from 8 to 5%. to 1, was third,
four lengths back. Had Cardigan won
hia backers would have cleaned up
handsomely. Not an accident occurred
in the big field of eight, and the race
was a spectacular one.
The fourth race was ruined by
scratches, leaving Bad News a pro
hibitive favorite at 1 to 4. He led from
start to finish.
A well-balanced card, a fast track

SHEEPSHEAD BAY. June â¢ 27.â In
strong contrast to the sport furnished
on Saturday, the majority of the races
run to-dav caused backers of public
form" much mystification. Open dis
satisfaction was expressed at the de
feats of Savable and Auromaster,
neither of which ran within many
pounds of Ills recent form.
Then, too, the disqualification of
Cascine in the second race was not at
all relished by those who could not see
where the California colt had given
sufficient cause for being disqualified,
although they did see Cascine run
across the track from the outside as
the stretch turn was made. Whether
he actually impeded Tepee, who fin
ished second, was "an open question
with even the most critical.

abused bv Police Officers Kruger and
Rice, who conveyed them in a patrol
tv'agon from Second and Folsom streets

The boys were arrested and charged

them aver to the custodv of Kruger

d*iendants said, they were cuffed and
beaten in a brutal way, although they

said, the Judge, surveying the rather

Adolph instantly responded by slashing
wickedly at Silvio with a large knife.
Then the fight degenerated to a foot
race, with Silvio maintaining the lead
until he ran into the arms of a po

Motor-man J. Keyes was the real hero
of the street car hold-up on Eddy street
the night of June 14, for /which Gert
Hurnell, a railroad laborer, was arrest
ed. In the court of Judge Mogan yes
terday the mctorman told of how the
car was boarded at Gough street by
Burnell, who after robbing Conductor
Campbell of J1S at pistol point com
manded the man at the lever to stop
the car.
"He pointed the gun at me," Keyes
testified, "and shouted, 'Stop her.' I
screwed down the brake, but left the
current open, and there was jio appre
ciable decrease in the car's speed.
When the defendant stepped to the
side of the dummy, with the evident
intention of Jumping off when we
slowed down, I released the brake and
crouched behind a seat, and as I did so
the car started down the steepest de
clivity on the route. It went so fast
that I was afraid it would leave the
rails, and the defendant could not Jump
without killing himself, so he stayed
until we struck a level stretch between
Buchanan and Laguna streets, when he
leaped off and went sprawling. Then I
lesumed control of the machinery and
stopped at Fillmore street, where I got
a bartender to blew a whistle until Of
ficer Wren ran up to us. I took him
on the car, reversed the trolley and
rushed full speed back to Buchanan
street, where the arrest was made."
Keyes fully identified Burnell as the
highwayman, as did Conductor Camp
bell and a citizen who saw him after
he leaped from the flying car.
The hearing will be 1 resumed, to-day.

Harry Hoffman, a plumber from Sac
ramento, was among those present at a
select Saturday evening hop in one of
the Market street dancing academies,
and after the ball he and John Sweeney
were arrested for disturbing the peace
at the foot of the stairway leading to
the ballroom. The testimony before
Judge Mogan showed that Sweeney was
not very aggressive and he was dis
charged, while the gentleman from Sac
ramento was pronounced guilty and
ordered to appear to-day for sentence.

James Kelly, a negro who speaks
with Hibernian "brogue" and claims
County Clare. Ireland, as his place of
birth, was before Judge Mogan for the
eleventh time on the charge of va
grancy. Bailiff Hickey, who proudly
proclaims himself a native of "Sweet
County Clare," looked unutterable
things at the dusky defendant, whom
the court rules compelled him to handle
with gentleness.

K. C. Gardner was the latest victim
of the mysterious and mischievous per-
son who pushes lottery tickets into the
pockets of Caucasian wayfarers in the
Chinese quarter. There was no less
than six of the prohibited mediums of
gaming, each costing the buyer Twen
ty-five cents, in a pocket of Mr. Gard
ner's vest when he was stopped and
searched by an inquisitive policeman.

William Murray, who recently was
liberated from prison after serving a
six months' sentence for beating his
mother, will be sentenced for vagrancy
to-day by Judge Mogan. Since his res
toration to freedom Mr. Murray has
been consorting with one Roele Ritch,
tailoress, at 132 Sixth street, and while
quarreling with the woman last Sun
day morning he was arrested.
â¢ â¢ â¢
Charles McCarthy, who keeps a fruit
store at Eighteenth and Tennessee
streets, explained to Judge Mogan that
is was in celebration of his birthday
that he drank to excess and behaved
in such a disorderly manner last Sat
urday evening that a passing police
man casually picked him up and took
him to prison. He was dismissed with
a reprimand.
Four times wfthin the past two
weeks has Charles McKenzie Garcia
been arrested in Chinatown and booked
for vagrancy. For each^ojLhls prior
offenses he was punished with twenty
four hours' imprisonment, but thÂ« one
for which he is to be sentenced to-day
by Judge Mogan will probably bring a
longer term.

NAPA, June 37. â The City Board
of Health of Napa has passed strong
resolutions in regard to the vaccina
tion of school children and the use of
toy pistols. On the first subject the
resolution directs the trustees of Napa
school district to exclude from the
schools any child who has not been
vaccinated. Owing to the serious dan
ger of lockjaw resulting from the use
of toy pistols on the Fourth of July
the City Marshal and police are em
powered to confiscate all such fire
arms.
City Trustees Adopt Precautionary
Measure as Safeguard Against
Accidents.

Chabot. as executrix of the will of
the late Anthony Chabot, who died in
1888, leaving a fortune appraised at

count of her administration and asks
to be discharged. Almost all of the
estate has been distributed but two or
three pieces of real estate belonging to
the Contra Costa Water Company,
which she asks to be set apart to ths
company.
Property of the Builder of the
Contra Costa Water Works
Given to Heirs.

CHABOT IS DISTRIBUTED
STOCKTON, June 27. â The labor
troubles on the Stockton water front
were settled to-day at a joint meeting
of the longshoremen and the feed and
flour packers' unions. The men, who
had been locked out, .decided to re
turn to work as individuals, there be
ing a tacit understanding that the old
hands would receive the preference of
work. Hereafter the mills and ware
houses will be run on the open shop
plan. This is a complete victory for
the mill and warehouse men. The
cause of the return to work is the fact
that a few of the feed and flour pack
ers out on strike went back to work.
The lockout occurred May 16. The
boycott on the Sperry mill has been
raised. The action taken does not af
fect the situation as far as the Holt
Company is concerned.
Employers at Stockton Win the Fight
and Open Shop Rule Will
Prevail.

Ted Melone", the hero of the wreck,
is in a hospital at Jamestown. He is
more seriously injured than at first re
ported.
Saturday afternoon the work train,
consisting of five flat cars heavily
loaded with gravel and hauled by a
light locomo'tive, was ordered to go to
Jamestown. It met the Angels-bound
passenger train at the Elrico mine and
went on a sidetrack.
The passenger train picked up an oil
car and attached it to the rear of the
passenger coach. Crackenbush then
pulled out on the main line and started
up the long steep switchback. He al
most reached the top and there his
locomotive was overcome by Its load.
The brakes were applied, but they
failed to hold and the heavy train ran
away down the grade, crashed into the
rear of the passenger train, butted the
oil car through the passenger coach
and spread death, injury and destruc
tion.
STOCKTON, June 27.â Exonerated by
the Coroner's jury and discharged by
the railroad company lsB the fate that
the railroad company is the fate that
which wrecked the Sierra passenger
train a few miles from Angels Satur
day night, killing Mrs. Joseph Demar
tirii ;and Mrs. Frank Valente of this
city.- The inquest into the deaths of
the two women was held at Jamestown
this morning. The following verdict
was returned by the Coroner's Jury:
"To the best of our knowledge and
according to the testimony we have
heard, we find that the work train was
too heavily loaded for Its brakes on a
grace such as the one It was operated
on." (
Tlje.crew of the work train wu made
up Of John Goler, conductor; E. W.
Crackenbush, engineer; Sam Lock
wooi'l, fireman; A. Ford, brakeman.
The railroad officials discharged the
entire crew this morning. Cracken
busri is said to be an expert locomotive
engineer and is well liked by all who
know him. -

The Oceanio Steamship Company's
liner Sierra, Captain Houdlette, which
arrived yesterday from the Antipodes,
encountered a heavy storm shortly
after leaving Auckland and for thirty
hours was given every opportunity to
prove her worth as a heavy weather
boat. The wind, which blew In fre
quent squalls, developed hurricane force
and for twelve hours the Sierra made
her way at reduced speed. The liner
weathered the storm In splendid shape
and without much discomfort to those
on board. Several seas were shipped
and one of them knocked down a mess
boy, who picked himself up when the
water receded, with several painful
bruises to show for his eticounter with
the wave.
Among the Sierra's passengers was
Sir Tatton Sykes, the British horse
man. Major Taylor, the negro bicycle
rider, also returned on the liner.
E. W. Darling, the Stanford student
who went to Honolulu to get closer to
mother nature, returned on the Sierra,
The semi-nakedness, which is part of
his plan for securing health in its
primitive vigor, did not meet with ap
proval In the Island capital, and Dar
ling, after having been arrested for va
grancy, was given his freedom on the

Much better than the original Hope
Langham was Miss Virginia Brissac,
and Miss Brissac has done pretty
things of the kind before. Given* a
little more vivacity and her girlish.
Winsome picture of the young Ameri
can girl would be of unusual value.
Again competing favorably with the
original is Fred Butler's MacWilliams,
whose primitive virtues were excellent
ly exploited by the actor. The best two
bits of work in the piece are, however,
John B.\ Maher's Captain Burke and
George Barnum's President Alvarez,
both admirably -fitted In. Miss Bel
garde's Mmei Alvarez is another figure
more convincing that the original play
er's. The rest fill In -without much
conviction, Miss Ellsmere's Alice 1 Lang
ham,. Mr. Cohners' Captain Stewart
and Mr. Johns' Reginald King being
all notably but; of pitch. 53 But the aver
age-, of the Â¦ performance is high and
the piece will* be "enjoyed by' all who
like a bit of j wholesome, boisterous,
sunny Americanism. Â¦' Â¦ . * ' Â¦Â¦-
BLANCHE PARTINGTON.
It is a matter . of personality, the
disagreement of Mr. VWhittlesey and
his part, that of the, square-jawed,
practical, resourceful American, Rob
ert Clay. One does not believe him, for
example, when he ,' pictures himself
fighting with "greasers" for his last
dollar on the floor of a Mexican mud
hut. Nor does he persuade ' to belief
as the mining engineer, who bullies,
blarneys, bulldozes 2000 lazy Mexican
workmen Into a contented obedience.
As a lover, yes, Mr. Whittlesey makes
eloquent love to the Hope Langham â
nice girl! Yet even his loses
point from his failure to catch the vital
Americanism of the character, for it is
herein that the portrait of Robert Clay
is distinctive. In good sooth the Whit
tlesey Clayâ "He might have been a
Roosian, a Turk, or French, or Proo
sian, or an I-tal-i-an!"â in spite of all
Mr. Davis 1 temptations to him to be
come an American. Yet the perform
ance â¬ <loes not lack power. Mr. Whit
tlesey's grip on the breathless climax
of the third act, where Clay's friend is
shot dead at his side, is a compelling
one. The scene is vigorously sincere
and persuasive. Yet the portrait as a
whole Is not the actor's best work.
White TVhittlesey's standing with the
Alcazar, clientele must be flatteringly
adjudged from the house that greeted
the popular actor last night. Mr. Whit
tlesey began his usual summer season
on O'Farrell street last evening in
"Soldiers of Fortune.' the Richard
Harding Davis play Introduced here by
Robert Edeson, and an audience the
size of the theater made a festival of
the occasion.
To leave Mr. Whittlesey for a mo
ment, it may be truly said th'at the Al
cazar produced the play admirably.
There are some in the castâ Mr. Whit
tlesey not of them, unfortunately â that
equal the original players, and the pic
tures are excellent.
The contract for furnishing absorb

motor for the sterilizer. The commit
tee promised to pay $2600 for the ster
ilizer out' of next year's urgent neces

ENG-AOEMEXT LAST XIGHT AT
THE ALCAZAR.
Policemen Hook and Carr and Messrs.
Baldwin and Piths and others corrob
orated the woman's story of the shoot
ing. The Jury's verdict was suicide.
Miss Hunt told her story in a tone
that contained more indignation than
Borrow. She said she had never given
Black the least encouragement, but
had always turned aside his advances.
Kear Powell street the attention of
Policeman Carr was attracted by the
wrangling. At sight ot the officer
Black drew his revolver. "Don't come
near me," he shouted, "or I will kill
myself." â¢
The tailor ran up Powell street and
Policeman Harry Hook, who was on a
passing car. leaped off and joined in
the chase. Hook drew his revolver and
fired a shot into the air. Almost at the
same Instant Black's pistol spoke and
thÂ£ tailor dropped to the sidewalk. He
had carried out his frequent threat of
suicide.
Baldwin and Piths started down Sut
ter street with Miss Hunt. The tailor
followed endeavoring to get near the
young woman and begging her to meet
him that night.
POLICEMAN" ARRIVES.
On the Tuesday morning of the sui
cide Miss Hunt boarded the dummy of
a Sutter street car. As she neared
Taylor street she saw the white pas
sionate face of Black peering intently
at her through the car window.
She dismounted and Black followed
her. "Come with me," he pleaded. "If
you do not I will kill you and then
myself. Promise to meet me to-night."
Badly frightened. Miss Hunt gave
the promise and asked him to give her
the revolver. She threw the weapon
irlto the street and shouted to two
passersby. Monta Piths and A. M.
Baldwin, to secure' the weapon. Before
They could do so Black seized it and
placed it in" his pocket.
c On the evening before the tragedy
he lurked in the doorway of Miss
Hunt's home and as she entered clutch
ed her roughly by the arm. "Come with
me." he panted, "or I will kill myself."
c The young woman broke away and
called a policeman, at sight of whom
Black fled.
When she took trips to this city the
ir.fatuated tailar followed her with the
eternal entreaty, "Come away with me,
anywhere:" In March of the present
year the young woman left Black's
employ and moved to this side of the
bay. The ardent tailor continued to
haunt her.
FOLLOWED LIRE A SLEUT1L
At the Coroner's inquest on the death
cf James Black, who shot himself last
Tuesday because of a mad infatuation
for Ethel Hur.t, the woman in the case
told a clear cut story of persecution.
For two years the tailor had dogged
her footsteps, breathing into her ear
jiassionnte entreaties to flee with him.
Wherever she went he followed, hang
ir.g about her as persistently as the
Old Man of the Sea clung to Sindbad.
He haunted her with his longing eyes.
Miss Hunt testified that she met
Black two years ago in Oakland when
f?he entered his employ as a seamstress.
Her employer soon made advances to
her. which she tried to turn aside,
knowing that he was married. But he
would not be rebuffed.
He would follow her to restaurants
end sit beside her while she ate. \

OTHER FAMILY TROUBLES.
Judge . Graham yesterday granted a
divorce to Adeline Payne from Herman
T. Payno, mate ot the steamer Cres
cent City. The mother was given the
custody cf the three-month-old child,
$1000 in lump alimony and an allowance
cf $.",0 a month for the support of the
child until it reaches the age of 10
years. In her complaint Airs. Payne
alleged that prior to the birth of the
babe the husband left her at horn*
alone, and that after the little one
came into the world he continued to
spend his time with other persons and
made her dependent upon her rela
tives for support.
An order dated June 24 from Superior
Judge Hebbard, who is on a vacation,
was filed yesterday, granting Mrs.
Edith Madden actual custody ef her
child on Monday and Friday of each
week between the hours of 10 a. m. and
6 p. m. The order is to apply perld
ing the hearing of Captain John P.
Maddcn's suit for divorce. The child
is now at . the home of his grand
parents, Mr. and Mrs. Jerome Madden,
and the mother is to be permitted to
visit him .there In the hours named
without hindrance or interference from
any person, and she may take the boy
away from the home wherever she
pleases in this and adjoining counties,
but must not take him out of the juris
diction of the court.
ALIMOXY IX LUMP.
John Anderson's wife, Johanna,
caused his arrest on June 22 on a charge
of insanity, and he was confined for
two days in a cell "at the Central
Emergency Hospital. An examination
proved him to be sane, and yesterday
he sued her for divorce. If the numer
ous allegations of cruelty made by him
against his wife are true it might be
imagined that he is fortunate in not
having gone insane. He declares that
Johanna often remained away from
home until unreasonable hours; that
she void him the family would Be bet
ter off if he would take poison and die;
that the reason she did not thrash him
was because she "did not want to dirty
her hands"; that she shook and shoved
him around the house and that she
accused him o? trying to poison their
eldest child. Agnes, thereby "prejudic
ing the child against him." He charges
further that she has been guilty of in
fidelity with one Gustave Adolphson.
Anderson says that his wife has be
tween $2500 and $3000, which he has
giv^n her at various times, and that
this, with the household furniture at
1304 Powell street, is community prop
erty.
The night elevator boy, Sears, tes
tified that Hislop had not remained at
the house all night.
HE IS" NOT IXSAXE.
Mrs. Hislop is said to have opposed
the arrangement and to have said that
she could "get along without him."
Peter P. Lemperle, stepfather of Jaiser,
the detective who shadowed Hislop.
was called to declare against the
young man's reputation for truth and
honor.
The affidavit of Violette Griswold,
named as co-respondent in Mrs. His
lop's complaint, was read in court. The
young woman is now at Victoria, B. C.
She says that she is 22 years old and
has been divorced from a man named
W. D. Hastee at Seattle. She says
that in three years she has met His
lop in the Xorth about ten times, but
there has been nothing Improper be
tween them. She declares that she
came to San Francisco with William
Griswold and that Hislop took them
to the Raleigh. Hislop used to spend
some of his time there, but it was Gris
wold who shared the room.
On the side of the defense were Wit
nesses Morris J. O'Callaghan, a police
man, and L. A. Sayes, a commercial
traveler, who told of futile efforts they
had made, as friends of^the family, to
effect a reconciliation between the
couple.
MRS. U1SLOP SAID NO.
The Hislop divorce case again occu
pied the greater portion of Superior
Judge Sloss' time yesterday and Louisa
K. -Hislop's side of the controversy
was finished with the testimony of
Elizabeth V. Keeker. Mrs. Becker Is
proprietor of the Raleigh Hotel at 319
Sutter street, wherein, on September
17, 1902, George W. Hislop is said to
have given his wife cause for a legal
separation. The witness testified, in
the morning, that on the date,.men
tioned Hislop appealed at the house
with a woman and engaged a suite for
one week. He registered as Mr. Gris
wold and introduced the woman as his
wife, according to the testimony. Mrs.
Becker said that some months later
liislop acain came to the house and
she. Mrs. Becker, asked him "how his
wife v.ns" and he threw up his hand
and said, "Oh, she was not my wife; my
name is Hislop." At the afternoon ses
sion Mrs. Becker produced the house
register showing the entry of Gri3wold
and wife. \
When the ordinance came up before
the Board of Supervisors it was re
ferred to the Joint Committee on Ju
diciary and Police for a report.
Under Long's ruling the only way to
bring about the relief proposed by the
ordinance is to submit a charter
amendment to the people. Hocks de
clares that this course will be taken
by the Liquor Dealers' Association, at
whose request he introduced the ordi
nance and the amendment will be sub
mitted at the enection next November.
If such limitation as is intended to be im
posed upon the Police Commissioners by bill
No. 1 410 were adopted, the power now possessed
by the Commissioners and conferred upon
them by express charter provision would be
so limited as to deny them the power to grant
permits to any lwrson whose application
therefor, when added to the number already
enjoying permits, might be found to be in ex
cess ol the number possessing nuch privilege on
January 1, I!*i4. l.'nd^r the charter provisions
as now in f<->rce no such limitation can be pro
vided by ordinance.
Long further says that the section
of the ordinance limiting the number
of saloons to the number in jtpsra
tion on January 1,1904, is also illegal, as
the power conferred by the charter on
the Police Commission to grant liquor
permits to "any person" is without
limitation. On this point the opinion
says:
WOULD LIMIT POWER.
The contemplated provision would be void
upon the further ground that it assumes to
deprive thÂ« Police Commissioners of a power
conferred ui>on them without limitation. This
m-y not iw* done legally. No ordinance can be
legally adopts, the terms of which are In con
flict with the constitution or the laws of thÂ»
State. No pow<r is conferred upon the Board
of Supervisors to grant permits to carry on
the liquor business. On the contrary such
power is conferred upon the Board of Police
Cmpatlrstoaen, and -without change In the pro
visions of the charter authorizing the Super
visors so to do no valid ordinance can bi
pdsse-l under the terms of which such permits
may be granted..
The charter assumes to reRUlate this matter
in s^ttion 1 of chapter a of article VIII by
conferrinB the power upon th? Board of Police
Commissioners to srant such permits, and ex
pressly declares "without such permit none
of such persons shall engage in the selling of
liquor." A pcrmtt granted by the Board of
Supervisors would not confer the privilege
upon the appellant to carry on the liquor
buslne.s. Such a .privilege can be secured
or.ly through a permit granted by the Ucmrd
of Police ComnjitriontTE.' since the chartt-r ex
prvssly provides that without such permit no
person desiring to engage in such business
shall engage therein.
PKOVIS1OX IS VOID.
It is couunjplated by tectlon 3 of bill No.
1410 that en appeal may bs taken from the
action of the Board of Police Commissioners In
rejecting an application lor a permit to the
Hoard of tiupervisors, upon which appeal the
Board of Supervisors may pase, and if In the
judgment of the Bc:rd of Supervisors the per
mit should be granted, they may authorize the
Tax Collector to Issue a license therefor.
City Attorney Long yesterday sent
an opinion to the Board of Super
visors in which he holds that the pro
postd ordinance introduced by Super
visor Hocks to allow of an appeal being
taken to the Board of Supervisors in
cases where the Police Commissioners
refuse to grant permits to sell liquor
is in conflict with section 1 of chapter
3 of article VIII of the. charter and is
therefore void and illegal. The opinion
says:
The California delegation to the
Democratic National Convention will
leave this city for St. Louis at 10:30
a. m. to-day. In the worK of prepar
ing his great speech Mr. Delmas is
making fair progress from day to day.
After the shouting and tumult incident
to- the departure of the delegation from
San Francisco shall have subsided. Mr.
Delmas will seek the seclusion of hi3

It is urovided that the delegates

tion on Tuesday, August 9, at the same
time that the delegates to the State
convention, called to meet at Santa
Cruz, are elected. Separate delegations
must be chosen, as no delegate can
serve In both conventions.
The local convention will nominat*
four candidates for Judges of the Su
perior Court, eighteen Assemblymen
and a State Senator for each of th<*
odd numbered Senatorial districts and
a State Senator for the Twenty-fourth
Senate-rial District to fill the vacancy
caused by the death of George H. "Wil
liams. Thomas H. Lindsay stands
ready to receive the Republican nom
ination in the last named district and
his supporters are active.
The Fourth Congressional District
Republican Committee will meet to
night at 16 Geary street. It is under
stood that the delegates to the State
convention from the several Assembly
districts' of the Fourth Congressional
District will come together at Santa
Cruz or in this city and nominate a
candidate for Congress. The same rule
will probably be applied in tha Fifth
District.
The Republican local convention to
nominate candidates for Judicial and
legislative positions will assemble at
8 p. m. on Monday, September 26. The
county committee, Thomas D. Riordan,
chairman, and Thomas Atkinson, sec
retary, met last night at 16 Geary
street and adopted a call for the con
vention. The meeting was well at
tended. The call, which was presented
by Colonel Charles Sc-nntag, provides
that the convention shall consist of 212
delegates, apportioned as follows to the
several districts:
The proposed clause limiting the
number of stories of wooden buildings
to three was eliminated from the pro
visions of the ordinance, the height
limit being deemed a sufficient reduc
tion.
J. Humphrey and L. Leffler opposed
the amendment, saving that It would
be Impossible to build flats with the
restricted height limit.
The board also passed to print an
other amendment to the building or-
The Board of Supervisors yesterday
passed to print the amended ordinance
limiting the height of all wooden build
ings to forty-five feet. The limit under
the old ordinance has been fifty feet,
but the, reduction is in the line of bet
ter fire protection and is favored by
the Fire Wardens and insurance men.
The latter appeared before the Joint
Finance, Fire and Building Committee
previous to the meeting of the board
and urged the adoption of the lower
limitation.

If the rate of $1.2053 were put into ef
fect it would result in the collection of
more than $400,000 for which no appor
tionment could be made, and as a con
sequence the surplus would lie idle in
the city treasury until July 1, 1S05.
Rather than collect this surplus, which
could not be used, the board decided to
adopt a lower rate, which will result in
a revenue of $7,392,386 to meet the bud
get expenditures. The segregated items
and funds follow:
The Board of Supervisors yesterday
passed to print an ordinance fixing the
city's tax rate for the next fiscal year
at $1 12 'on every $100 of assessed valu
ation. This is a reduction of S.53 cents
on the rate of $1.2053 as originally con
templated in the municipal budget just
adopted owing to the fact that t*he lat
ter rate was based on an estimated as
sessed vaulation of $465,000,000, when in
point of fact. Assessor Dodge will re
turn an assessed valuation of more
than $500,000,000.
