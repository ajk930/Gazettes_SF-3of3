SAN FRANCISCO," THURSDAY, JANUARY 14, 1904.
Miss Catherine Flatley Tells Chief Wittman That Brother-in-Law of Joseph Blaise Told Her, as an
Inducement for Her to Marry Him, That He Would Soon Have $7000 Coming From
Germany â Officers Find That Suspected Man Took Life Insurance Policies
From Dead Man's Valise on Morning Body Was Found.
POLICE SECURE STRONG EVIDENCE AGAINST SOEDER
FROM THE YOUNG WOMAN HE TRIED TO MAKE HIS WIFE
Detective Thomas Gibson
found that Soeder did not re
turn to his room, on the night
of the murder. On the morn
ing the murder was discovered
Soeder went to his room and
took from Blaise's grip the in
surance policies on his life.
These were found on him at the
time of his arrest.
toward justifying the po
lice in placing 'a charge of mur
der against Leon Socder. Chief
Wittman claims to have re
ceived some very damaging tes
timony from Miss Catherine
flatley, the woman whom Soe
der sought to marry. It' is al
leged that Soeder told Miss
Flatley a short time ago, as an
Inducement for her to marry
him. that he would have $7000
coming from Germany in about
three weeks. This t fact accounts
for the anxiety Soeder displayed
at the delay in the issuance of
the Insurance policies on the life
of his brother-in-law. Chief
Wittman says that Miss Flat
ley has also given him enough
other evidence, the nature of
which he refuses to disclose, to
make a strong case against Soe
der.

In Sergeant Bidwell's office in the City
Prison in the afternoon. There he un
derwent a vigorous fire of questions
from Detectives Hogan and Martin.
Captain Martin refused. to state what
took place at the Interview.
Late last - night District Attorney
Byington. it is alleged, met with Cap
tain Martin, Detective Gibson and Boe
der in his office in the Hall of Justice.
What took place at this meeting is not
known, but It is understood that Soeder
skillfully evaded all questions that
would tend in any way to strengthen
the case against himself.
The $7000 that Soeder expected to
get and use as an inducement in the
gaining of the hand of Miss Flatley is
most likely the money represented in.

ed to obtain from the Hartford Issur-
The statement that Miss Flatley made
to .Chief Wittman in regard to Boeder's
statement about the $7000 he expected
to get will be the strongest link toward
his conviction. Chief Wittman refused
to say much about the case yesterday.
He said that they had secured all that
tbey wanted from Soeder for the time
being and that they would now devote
their time to running down clewÂ» they
had. He said that the statements of
Miss Flatley had been of most impor
tance to them in their effort to place
the responsibility on the . shoulders of
Soeder.
SOEDER AGAIN QUESTIONED

stains on it, thus wiping out all pos
sibility of securing what might have
been the most Incriminating piece ot
evidence against the supposed murder
er. To-day Detective Gibson will take
Soeder to the cleaning works to sea
if the clerk can identify him as the
one who brought the suit to be clean
ed. They are anxious to know if tha
alleged murderer received any assist
ance., either in. the crime itself or the
subsequent destruction of everything:
that might tend to serve as circum
stantial evidence against him. The
police, however, .believe that Soeder
took the suit to the establishment
himself. .

policies. These were found on Soeder
at the time of his. arrest. This Is
deemed a valuable piece of evidence.
Joseph Nieblas and wife of 827 Jack
son street, at whose house Soeder and
Blaise roomed, yesterday stated that
they did not believe that Soeder came
to his- rooms until late In the morn
ing following the night on which the
murder was committed. Soeder has
stoutly maintained since hts arrest
that when he got up on the morning
Blaise . was missing: he went out to
the house of his friends at 4S00 Mis
sion street to see If Blaise had stayed
there over night.
CLEANING OP THE SUIT.
The detectives working on the case
did not believe the man. however, and
claimed that he spent Monday morn
ing in getting rid of his gray suit and
in the selling of his revolver. This
hft must have done before going out
to the Mission, as Moritz Meienburg
an uncle of the girl who came over on
the steamer at the Â¦ same time as
Blaise and Soeder. and whom Blaise
and Soeder used to visit, confirms his
statement. Meienberg says that on
the morning the dead body of Blaise
was found with a gaping wound in
the neck on the side of Russian Hill
Soeder came out to his house and
asked if his friend Blaise had stopped
there over \ night. Later on in the
afternoon of the same day Meienberg
says, Soeder again came out to the
house and showed them the evening
paper .with the account of the mur
der, of Blaise.
This statement from Meienberg 1 Â¦will
tend to help Soeder, bt : the other evi
dence against him wi ;.ove too con
clusive. One thing is certain, that if
he d!Â« goto the Mission on the morning
of the. "murder" he got rid of the gTay
suit . he Â¦ wore . on Sunday and sold his
revolver, before he went to his friends'
house. The former, statement, made by
the proprietors of the Native Son3

strongest testimony, against herformer

told /Wittman that . Soeder,* about : a

The police have obtained new evi
dence of, a damaging nature against
Leon Soeder, accused of murdering. Jo
seph Blaise, his brother T in-law, to se
cure the latter's life insurance. The
new evidence materially strengthens
the ' case against Soeder and to-day
there may. be a charge .of murder
placed against him. Yesterday Detec
tive Tom Gibson discovered that Soe
der did not return to his rooms at the
house of Mrs. Nieblas at 827 Jackson
street until early Monday morning. It
was also found that Soeder, as soon as
the murder was discovered, went again
to the room he and Blaise had occu
pied and took from Blaise's grip the
insurance policies on the life of the
last named. He ate breakfast in the
Original Mexican Restaurant at 721
Broadway, and after getting rid of his
gray suit and revolver "went to the
house of the girl he met" coming over
on the steamer from Germany and pre
tended to be looking for. Blaise.
Chief Wittman says he now has a
strong case against Soeder and is posi
tive of his guilt. He claims to h,ave
secured damaging evidence against
Soeder yesterday from Miss Catherine
Flatley, the woman whom Sped er was
at one time going to wed, but who
afterward jilted him.
Hepburn declared that if the Repub
lican party was responsible for the ad
ministration of the affairs of the Gov
ernment the friends of that party
should hold all of the available places.
Hepburn referred to an interview he
had had with the head of a department
having more than BOO clerks, who had
stated that he had fifty clerks who
could not get to their.desks if the ele
vators in the building were not running
and that should he be permitted to
select his own force he could do all
the business with 200 clerks.
Spooner warned the Democrats that
a "platform which imputes dishonor to
the administration ;and^ to the brave,
true " man" In th"e "White* House would
find no sympathy with the people of
the United States north or south."
Spooner declared that Â¦ the President
had acted within the .constitution and
the law in all that he had done in
Panama. He said that he. for one. re
sented the imputation that the Presi
dent had been unscrupulous In his deal
ings with this question. This last state
ment was made after Tillman had ex
pressed the opinion that the American
Consul had bribed the Colombian forces
to withdraw from the isthmus.
In opposing the civil service appro
priation Grosvenor said:
"When this law went into effect the
expenditures under the bill now pend
ing here amounted to about twenty
million dollars. To-day it amounts to
thirty millions and' we are told that
the reason for'that is that 16 per cent
of this amountâ that is the estimate
given to me yesterday â is paid to men
absolutely worthless to tne public ser
vice, so that we have practically a
civil pension. It is enough to say that
the expenditures under .this system
have increased. 30 per cent; that the
wrongs and outrages and irregularities
and crimes that are charged to-day, if
they did not originate under the civil
service administration, have been cov
ered through the administration of that
system up to date."
Hepburn declared that he was not
inclined to criticize the methods of the
commission, "but the civil service as
it is administered is a fraud and hum
bug." This statement met applause on
both sides of the House.
Notice was given by Bingham, In
charge of the bill, that an aye and no
vote would be demanded when the bill
is presented In the House. No conclu
sion was reached on the bill in com
n-.ittee.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 13.â After a
lively debate lasti: j three hours the
House to-day in committee of the
whole, by a vote of 78 to 65, struck out
of the legislative, executive and Judi
cial appropriation bill the paragraph
providing for the salaries and expenses
of the Civil Service Commission and
clerks employed under the commission!
The action was taken' on motion of
Hepburn of Iowa. He was supported
by Republicans and Democrats both in
speeches and the vote.
Those who spoke in opposition to the
civil service system, as it now exists,
were Hepburn (R.) of Iowa, Grosvenor
(R.) of Ohio and Bartlett (D.) of Geor
gia, while among those speaking .for
the service were Cooper (R.) of Wis
consin and Gillette (R.) of Massachu
setts.
After a. period of fourteen months,
during which Estill is said to have de
frauded hotels in nearly every town
within a radius of 100 miles of Chi
cago, and had secured money under
aliases of II. T. Elliott. H. T. Ebcrsteln.
n. H. Thompson, R. S. Hammond, J. V.
Carson. George P. Harris; R. L. Alex
ander and others, he -was tra"ed to San
Francisco. Estill was accused of <L >
Ertill 5s reputed to have used a clever
Ftrategt-ni to throw his victims off their
Kuan', by pjvtendlnK to safeguard hfs
checks against swindlers. He once rep
resented a house that sold a:: improved
checl. protector, and. It is said, he al
ways used this device, ostensibly ' to
k^ep* those lo whom he gave his checks
from increasing amounts Â»or which
they were drawn. â¢ '

His social standing enabled him to

of Cleveland, O.. for which he traveled.
IIÂ» was ( provided with a large number
rf blank checks, drafts and other sam
ples of his firm's work, which he is
said to have used to his own advan
tage, fining out checks to his credit.
He also obtained a . large supply of
blanks from the Pioneer Press Com
pany of St. Paul, Minn., for which he
worked long enough to replenish his
Fiork of stationery. Detectives who
v.orkrd on the case say his seeking
employment was merely for the pur
pose of securing blank checks, which
he f:llf-d out with various names and
obtained cash from the uns-ispectlng,
!;ot*l managers being his Principe' vic
tims. Most of the money he secured
by these transact lors probably went to
bookmakers.

Governor Pardee yesterday honored
the recuisition of the Governor of
Michigan tor the return to that State
of Estill, and Sheriff Shipman will start
back to Kalamazoo with his prisoner.
Holbrook T. Estill is said to be the
ton of J. Holbrook Estill, millionaire
owner of the Savannah Morning News,
vice president of the Associated Press
and candidate for Governor of Georgia-
Detectives say they have the man who
hat= swindled at least two Chicago ho
teTs.
While in Chicago last May Estill.
under the name of J. V. Carson, is said
to have obtained $75 frcrj the Great
Northern and 550 from the Stratford.
Tiring of the woman he married short
ly after entering his father's employ
en the Morning News. Estill left his
home, deserting his wife and three chil
dren.
He is regarded as one of the greatest

roast to coast. He committed forgeries
in Grand Rapids, Mich.: St. Paul,
Minneapolis and Chicago. He has three

and remained there but a day and a
half. In that time, however, he passed
a worthless check for $50 on the Amer
ican Hotel. The proprietors believed
hÂ«? was with a theatrical company then
playing in that city.
The truth reached the ears of the
Grand Rapids family, and they^aic^
<hÂ«.case before 6fiPrtff : Snipman. He
immediately started for Kansas City,
but arrived just after Estill and his
wife had left for this city. The Sheriff
succeeded, however, in stopping pay
ment on three worthless checks that
Estill had palmed off to replenish his
diminishing Ftock of money. The Sher
iff then continued his pursuit.
WORKS KAJ^AMAZOO.
It is understood that Estill recently
added bigamy to his other crimes, and
for this he will be obliged to stand
trial on his return to Michigan.
By his suave manner Estill won the
affections of the daughter of a prom
inent citizen of Grand Rapids, and
after a brief courtship made her his
wife. She accompanied him on his
trip to this city and was unaware of
the nefarious business in which her
husband was engaged until told by the
detectives. The officers of Kalamazoo
Â«ate that Estill is guilty of bigamy,
as he is married to a woman of Sa
vannah, Ga., by whom he has three
children.
In arresting J. Holbrook Estill. alias
R. S. Hammond, the San Francisco de
tectives in charge of the case may well
feel that they have landed a cele
brated criminal of a dangerous type.
Fictitious drafts are his stock in trade.
Estill was arrested on Tuesday by a
representative of the Pinkertons. by
Detective Tim Bailey of the local de
partment and by Sheriff Shipman of
Kalamazoo. Mich.

city from Washington to the. effect that
Judge Advocate General Davis has re
ceived the record of the court-martial
from the case of First Lieutenant H.
A. Roblchon, Seventeenth Infantry,
charged with . conduct unbecoming an
officer, and a gentleman while stationed
with his company at San Francisco. It
Is said that Lieutenant Robichon was
found guilty and sentenced to dismis
sal, which would require the action of
the President.
The cou/t-martlal " "proceedings
against Lieutenant Roblchon, as well
as the suit for divorce filed against
Mrs. Madden by her husband, created
considerable comment : ln this city a
month or so ago. The two cases were
indirectly interwoven- and one might be
said to be the direct outgrowth of the
other. I . i . .< . â¢ i Â¦ . :
When Mrs. Madden arrived in this
city from the Philippines last fall she
was immediately served with papers in
a. divorce suit filed .against her by her
husband on statutory grounds. At that
time no names were mentioned, but as
Mrs. Madden showed a disposition to
fight ;the case,' ah amended bill, of com
plaint w ; as filed. This directly charged
her with improper conduct with Lieu
tenant Hector A. Robichoh and many
others whose names' were not men
tioned.
The direct result of this was the is

Roblchon. to appear before a general

give testimony in his behalf. The most
damaging evidence, however, was given
by: one of the nurses at the Presidio
General- Hospital, where the lieutenant
was for a time confined. .. Her sworn

that he had felt regret at hearing the

136 m'les from San Francisco.
A dispatch from Fresno says all the
passengers were badly shaken up and
two mail clerks were bruised, but not
seriously Injured. There was a dense
fop. Ties had been piled across the
track about 200 yards east of the Volta
station.
Superintendent Palmer -aid the delay
to the train would depend upon the
speed with which the derailed cars
'were replaced. As to the accident it
cclf t.ie euperintender* said: "The owl

derailment blocked the west side tracks
and "snowed" the train dispatchers
As the Owl is one of the fastest
trains on the Southern Pacific Com
pany's lines, it was the result of cool
headed work to bring the train to a
stop before more serious results oc
curred. The deraiiÂ«*d engine and cars
ran some distance pounding: over the
ties and tearing up road bed before the
Ft op was made. Passengers were given
a lively shaking up. The railroad men
at division headquarters said no dam
age vras done that v.ould prevent the
train from continuing en its interrupt
ed Journey pouth soon after the derailed
rars and locomotive were replaced on
the track.
The engine, tender and four cars
were derailed at the switch and were
run off the tracks, but neither the lo
comotive nor anv of the coaches or
baggrage cars was overturned. Accord
ing to the brief rcoort filed at Division
Superintendent W. S. Palmer's office at
Oakland Pier, none of the passengers

Soeder wrote his name and Blaise's

PEKING, Jan. 13. â The forecast of
Russia's position regarding Manchu
ria, cabled from Berlin on January
11, coincides with the information re
ceived by the foreign legations here,
and also strengthens the impression
that war is unavoidable. At the Jap
anese legation no effort is made to
conceal the belief that war is ex
pected.
The crux of the situation is still
Russia's refusal to admit the right of
Japan to a voice in the settlement of
Manchurian affairs, which Japan con
siders one of Its most vital Interests,
and to sustain which the Japanese
Government is determined to resort
to arms if necessary.
The maintenance of Chinese neu
trality would banish the specter of a
Russian occupation of Peking, which
is greatly alarming the Chinese and is
causing some uneasiness at the le
gations, since, in anticipation of Rus
sia's approach, the court would "leave
Peking and the capital would? be re
moved to the Interior. 7: yj'ti

The St. Petersburg correspondent of
the Paris edition of the New York
Herald and the special cablegrams from
other correspondents at the Russian
capital say that the opinion is held
that the ratification of the Japanese
and American treaties came as a shock
to the Russian Foreign Office.
The Datlv News thinks that China
"has displayed ominous courage in her
recent diplomacy, which will make for
peace owing to the tremendous hazards
which war under the present circum
stances would involve."
"This is precisely the point for which
Japan has been contending and which
Russia declined to discuss with her.
Japan is now in the advantageous po
sition of championing a cause which is
also that of the United States."

LOS ANGELEo/ Jan. 13.â Hanging
over the dashboard of what remained
of his automobile and burned to a crisp,
the bodv of C. L. Caldwell, who had
been missing since the evening of the
Eth inst., was found late to-night in
the middle of a field two. miles from
the southwestern corner of the city.
The front wheels of the machine were
in a deep hole and the rear wheels
were -hanging over the edge, showing
that the automobile had been wrecked.
The fuel tank had exploded, and Cald
well had been burned - to* death pre
sumably because he had received in
juries that prevented him from saving
himself. The position of the body
showed that Caldwell had been thrown
from the seat, and after the bursting
of the gasoline tank the inflammable
fluid had run in'a pool about his feet,
placing his body in the center of the
fire.
Caldwell was last seen a week ago
yesterday, when he .started ,for his
home at the Dominguez ranch. He had
been drinking and could hardly con
trol his machine. How he jcame to the
place where the body was found will
never be known, but he had left the
main road and ridden through a field
a cruarter cf a mUe before the acci
dent happened. The decease4 was a
man of considerable wealth. He mar
ried a 'daughter of the late George Car
son, a pioneer of this section, and was
a member of the Dominguez family,
branches of which reside in various
sections of the State. He leaves a wife
and one child. â¢

The reports circulated to the effect
that M. Bezobrazoff, a leader of the
war party, whom the Czar recently
made a Secretary of State, had fallen
into disfavor, appear to have been un
true. He is going to Switzerland to
visit his family, but the appointment
of his associate, M. Matunin, the former
Russian Charge d'Affaires at Seoul, as
assistant of Admiral Abaza, executive
chief of the committee of the Far East,
is regarded as proof that M. Bezo
brazoff's influence, or the influence of
the party to which he belongs, has not
ceased to have weight In the councils
of the Russian empire. On the other
hand Matunin's appointment is re
garded as a gain by the opposition to
Foreign Minister Lamsdorff.
There is strong discontent with the
Government's policy among the ma
jority of the reading public, except in
army and navy circles, and even these
are not particularly anxious for war.
The general public considers that the
country's honor would be unsullied
even were no attention paid to Japan's
demands.
Conclusions favorable to peace could
be drawn from these sentiments only
if the popular discontent had reached
the masses, which hitherto have been

PARIS, Jan. 14.â The Matin claims
to be authoritatively informed that
France and Great Britain are contem
plating a Joint offer of their good of
fices, which diplomatists believe will be
successful. The two powers will ad
dress themselves especially to Japan.
The Japanese legation expressed the
opinion that these good offices would be
favorably received at Tokio, but it is
feared that Russia will profit by the
delay and complete her armament.
At the Russian Embassy such fears
were declared to be unfounded, Rus

A diplomatist interviewed by the
.Echo de Paris says that the French
engagement with Russia does not in
clude military intervention in the Far
East, but in the extremely unlikely
event that Great Britain would be
obliged to help Japan, according to
their treaty engagements, France and
Russia would take measures to safe
guard their interests, as provided by
the convention signed in March, 1902.
Thus far the representations which
Great Britain has made to Japan and
which France has made to Russia have
been in the way of advice that some
pacific means be found for determining
the dispute, rather than in the direc
tion of mediation. It was said posi
tively to-day that no representations
of a mediatory character had yet been
submitted, nor was it expected that
anything of the kind would be done
until after the contents of the Japan
ese reply to the latest Russian note
had become known. If the situation
warrants then, efforts at mediation
will be made. There seems no doubt
that such a step will be permissible

have made, according to reports pub

prise In Toklo, according to the dis

Herbert Schmitz of the Board of
Public Works had this to say con
cerning the injunction: "We rather
resent the idea of a civic body plas
tering us wlUi an injunction of this
sort. The board has done nothing: to
occasion it. and we contemplate doing
nothing. The action is entirely pre
mature and uncalled for, and our an
swer, which will be made on the 22d
day of this mo'ntH, will so state.
"We have discharged- no civil ser
vice employes, and to do so was most
remote In our minds. What reason a
civic organization such as the Mer
chants' Association would have for
enjoining us can only be explained by
the fact that its members have been
influenced by misleading newspaper
articles. The injunction will not af
fect us. as we have never had any
idea of doinjr what it forbids, and we
will appear in court with our answer."

In the complaint upon which the
deputy poundmen were arrested it was
alleged by Wong Kim Hong that the
defendants had 'entered his potato
patch, cut tlje* rope to which his horse
was tied and attempted to lead the
brute to the city pound. Seven of the
Mongolian's countrymen grasped the
rope that hung from the horse's neck
and pulled all together one way while
Newgard and Weinhardt pulled the
other way with a riata they had thrown
over the animal's head. While the in
ternational tug-of-war was in progress
the horse was nearly^choked to death.
Victory finally rested, with the Chinese
and Hone then swore to warrants ac
cusing the poundmen of . disturbing the
peace. In the testimony brought out
the defendants claimed that the. rope
During the progress of the open air
hearing Thomas Pellow, a Caucasian
witness, . had' the .. temerity to appear
before the court in the open lot ,with
his hat on and was reprimanded by
Justice Tappan, who remarked that if
the headgear were not removed he
would order the bailiff to eject the
offender from the "courtroom."
ALAMEDA, Jan. 13.â Chinese wit
nesses, with a Chinese interpreter, a
spavined .plow horse, two deputy pound
men and' City Justice R. B. Tappan,
the* only magistrate in California who
is able 'to â¢try a case in the Chinese
tongue, we're the leading characters in
a trial that was held to-day in a potato
patch at the corner of -Park street and
Blanding avenue. The horse's tall,
which was introduced in evidence,/ was
the determining factor in bringing
about ' a dismissal of charges of dis
turbing the peace, which had been pre
ferred "against the'two equine catchers,
A. C. Newgard and>C -3* ~ Weinhardt,
by. Wong Kim Kong, a Chinese -truck
farmer.
The trial of the case was greatly
facilitated by Justice Tappan's knowl
edge of the Chinese tongue. The Jus
tice is a student of this ancient lan
guage and Is reputed . fo have more
actual knowledge of the grammar of
Chinese than most of the coolies who
learned their mother tongue by word of
mouth and not by rule of grammar.
When there was any doubt of interpre
tation Justice Tappan took a hand and
a tongue in the case and proceeded to
question the Mongolians in their own
language. The a%ve of a Judge coupled
with the awe of one who could talk to
them in their own language was more
than the yellow men could stand, and
they were. only too glad to get out of
the presence of the white Mandarin
who knew a yellow language, even if
they lost their case.
Punks and joss sticks were burning
in all parts of Alameda's Chinatown to
night, to drive away. the devil who had
told the white Mandarin all about
China, Its men and its language, and
there will be no Chinese law in Justice
Tappan's court from now on.
was so long that it permitted the horse
to graze on the sidewalk, which is pro
hibited. The Chinese farmer, on the
other hand, asserted that the rope
would not allow the horse to reach the
sidewalk. To satisfy himself Justice
Tappan held court in the potato patch.
It 'was found by arranging the horse
and the rope that if the horse took a
notion to stretch his tail in a horizontal
direction it would reach across the for
bidden sidewalk line. On" this showing
Justice Tappan held that the animal
had overreached the limits prescribed
by, the law and was liable to capture
by the poundmen. He considered that
the defendants were justified in trying
to | catch the horse as an encroacher
upon the public street and that the
peace of Wong Kim Hong had not been
disturbed. .

Le Carvey was taken to the Central
Police station by Policeman Henne
berry of the Harbor station. He made
no resistance when arrested. He said
his victim had insulted a woman he
knew and brought on the hostilities.
He was arraigned for murder in the
Police Court yesterday morning.
The injured man was conveyed to
the Receiving Hospital and later to
the City and County Hospital, where
he died.
A quarrel Tuesday night on board
the French ship Vercinger, lying at
the Vallejo-street wharf, resulted in
the murder of Vincent Le Meur by
Vincent Le Carvey. Both men were
sailors and the trouble arose over an
insult which the murdered man is al
leged td have hurled at. the other.
Both men left the ship andÂ«drank a
great deal along the Barbary Coast
and in water front resorts. When they
started to return to their bunks the
first fight occurred, but both were
separated and agreed to part in peace.
As quickly as the pair was on the deck
of the vessel the fight was renewed
and after a brief struggle, in which
the combatants rolled over and over
on the greasy planking, Le Carvey
drew a long knife and plunged it into
the breast of Le Meur.

AND MUItDEIl IS RESULT
"It's all a lie about the pistol," said
the doctor. "I never intended to kill
Schmidt at all. But I wanted to call
him down for what he has said and
done in regard to many things. That's
all. I think I've had satisfaction, and
that's all I want."
This Is not the first time the doctor's
bellicosity has brought him into the
full glare of the calcium. His contro
versy with Coroner Mehrmann fills a
page in the annals of Alameda County.
It was all over the cause of a woman's
death, about which Dr. Gladding knew
all, but would not answer the Coroner's
summons to testify at the inquest.
Threats of blood and death were ban
died about and it was generally .con
ceded that when the two met there
would be a duel right then and there.
But it happened otherwise. They met
in a place where ginger ale is served,
with the result that they have been
friends ever since.
But those who had counseled peace
ha$ their -way at last. Foremost of
these was Edward .Schmidt, who is al
most as much a friend of Dr. Glad
ding's as he is of his brother's. By a
little -maneuvering he succeeded in
bringing the belligerents together this
afternoon. They talked it all over
with their seconds and trainers, the up
shot of it all being an- agreement to
call off the dogs of war, at least tem
porarily. â¢--
' Dr. Gladding denied the pistol
incident part of his interview with
Postmaster Schmidt. The doctor says
that he had a real not a fancied griev
ance against Schmidt, else he would
not have gone to Interview him.
DENIES HE HAD PISTOL.
.The postmaster spent- the rest of the
night arming himself, and this morn
ing summoned his friends to a council.
Some were for having the flery-doc
tor arrested right away. Others coun
seled peace. .The postmaster couldn't
see where the peace came ; in while
there wa? a man out gurming for him.
Neither did he care vto venture- out of
doors unless he was furnished with
a coat of "mall or a truce signed by Dr.
Gladding, with the requisite number of
witnesses.
When I saw Gladding and Larson at the door
I said. "Good evening," and asked them to step
into the house. Gladding said they would talk
there. My little girl waa there, and I told her
to no In and she did. ,
GUdrtiUK talked about Imaginary grievances
for some time. He accused me of being Instru
mental in having Fisher's license taken away
from him. I denied having anything to do with
it. Then he drew a pistol and threatened me
with it. cursing me all the time. Ho swore he
would kill me it I did not secure a renewal of
Fisher's license or pay him J50OO. j
As Gladding kept brushing the pistol across
zay face I did not dare to move or reply. I tell
you what, that pistol was as big as a cannon
and I could see a bullet at the bottom of It as
if it hail started to come. All this time Nlei.
son stood by and said nothing. But after
awhile Gladding went away and left me, thank
ful that I was not dead. . -
COUNCIL IS CALLED.
With his anger fired up to the boil
ing point, the doctor called on the
postmaster at his home on University
avenue early in the evening. He was
seconded tiy his friend, Lars Nielson.
In response to their ring, the postmas
ter came to the door and a war of
words, . to be followed a little while
later with a promise of heavy cannon
ading, began. Here "is Postmaster
Schmidt's version of what happened:
BOILS WITH AN'GEK.
George' "Schmidt, Berkeley's rotund
postmaster, is thanking his lucky stars
because he is hot merely a. lump of
cold, soggy' clay, a remnant of other
days, blood-spattered on the grass. The
postmaster is not devoting all his grat
itude to the stars, however, as he feels
that he, owes just a*little, a very little,
to Dr. Charles F. Gladding, the fire
eating Kentucky colonel from West
Berkeley, for it was this same colonel
who forbore after he had made all the
necessary preparations \ to send hjs
enemy, the postmaster,' to a: hotter
postofllcfe than the one in Berkeley.
The postmaster and the doctor have
never been very good friends, their dif
ferences having begun with politics in
the long ago. Matters between them"
were not \ helped muelv either, when
Sam Fisher's saloon license was taken
away from him awhile ago because he
attacked some church men and women
at a "rummage sale." The doctor
thought the attacks on Fisher were in
spired by the postmaster and last night
he received Information that confirmed
his belief.

MAGNIFICENT VIEWS.
There was enough martial ardor
though on a 'simple white screen, to
give a reasonable idea of what is to be
found in Russia.
The lecturer's description of the
Czar's army prompted the mind to re
vert to the little brown man and his
comparatively new army, and in com
parison one could not help pondering
over the precocious little fellow's sa
gacity and quick-borrowing propensi
ties where borrowing can be advan
tageous.
Of course there were other subjects
portrayed, such as wonderful cathe
drals and public buildings and life on
the, streets of St. , Petersburg. .
To-night Holmes will lecture on and
show "Yellowstone Park."
ed escort,
The moving pictures gave an accu
rate and vivid idea of the result of the
Russian soldiers' drilling. They showed
the cavalry, artillery and Infantry and
they exhibited furthermore . thousands
of mounted troops coming forward at
full gallop.
Not least among the clever picture
groups were, those which presented the
Czar mounted upon a noble charger
and attended by nobles In magnificent
uniforms riding prancing blood horses.
The Czarina in her splendid carriage
drawn by four milk-white cobs was
shown whirling along, and at her side
was- the Empress Dowager and behind
the equipage came the dashing mount-
Whether ft is the scene of life in the
Ghetto, the fish market or the palace,
where enchanting surroundings bewil
der, or the review tableaux of 28,000
soldiers in drill before the Czar, it i3
all interesting to those who would be
come acquainted with lands and man
ners other than their own.
KUSSIAX SOIiDIERY.
Burton Holmes was greeted by a
large audience last night at Lyric Hall.
His subject .was "St. Petersburg,"
which, in view of complications be
tween the Russian and Japanese na
tions, was apropos. The lecture, and
the pictures, stereopticon views and
moving pictures, afforded, an oppor
tunity of judging something of the cali
ber of the Russian troops. -
Burton Holmes' illustrations on the
canvas are intensely picturesque, his
discourses are sound, graphic and
learned. He gives his hearers an in
sight into the life of nations; he tells
of the characteristics of peoples of the
world and what he imparts Is therefore
educational and broadening.
Regarding Mrs. Sherwood's late ac
qaintance with Mrs. Pleasant and the
removal of the sipk woman to the Fil
bert-street house, where she died, At
torney Morehouse made some rather
severe criticisms and intimated that
if the Sherwoods come into court
with a will later than the one in his
client's possession a bitter fight will
be the result.
Attorney Morehouse said this appar
ently in refutation of the statements
previously made by Mrs. Sherwood to
the effect that Mrs. Pleasant was con
scious and sound in mind up to the
very last. Regarding the former will
executed by Mrs. Pleasant, he said:
"The executors of this document are
Sam Davis of Carson City and Fred
Bell of this city. The will devises her
whole estate to Davis and Fred and
Reginald Bell, sons of Mrs. Theresa
Bell. We have a suit entitled Roberts
against 'the Donohoe-Kelly Banking
Company, which is set for trial before
Judge Sloss of February 2. It is an
action to recover on a box of diamonds
and jewelry valued ai $120,000 which
was deposited in that bank by Mrs.
Pleasant and subsequently delivered by
the bank, without authority of her, to
Mrs. Teresa Bell and R. Porter Ashe,
deputy district attorney. In the event
of the assignee, Roberts, recovering
these diamonds and jewelry Mrs. Pleas
ant's estate would receive a large sum
of money after the claims of the cred
itors were satisfied, and this money,
together with whatever other property
she owned at the time of her death,
would go to the devisees under her wilL
"If Mrs. Pleasant 's rights to the prop
erty can be preserved her estate is
worth over 5300,000, which would in
clude the Bell mansion and a ranch
in Sonoma County, both of which
properties were deeded to Mrs. Bell.
Suits are now pending to set aside
these deeds as having been made with
out consideration."
"About three weeks ago," said the
lawyer, "Mrs. Pleasant executed a
power of attorney to Mrs. Sherwood.
During her sickness Mrs. Pleasant
was supposed to receive an allowance,
which was paid over to one of the Bell
boys. The latter, it is claimed, failed
to turn over the money regularly and
Mrs. Sherwood was deputized by Mrs.
Pleasant to receive it thereafter. Later
I was informed that Mrs. Pleasant had
made a holographic will in favor of
Mrs. Sherwjood. As the story reached
me, Mrs. Sherwood claimed that. she
entered her patient's room and found
the will lying on the bed. Three weeks
ago, and for that matter, for the last
three months, which will be easily
proven, Mrs. Pleasant was mentally
incompetent to execute a will."
Last evening, however, both he and
his wife declined to deny or affirm the
story, but the suspicion that they know
about a second will has spread to those
interested in the other document,
among them Attorney H. V. Morehouse,
who was Mrs. Pleasant's counselor. In
discussing the matter last evening At
torney Morehouse "said that he had
heard of the will and was expecting
that the Sherwoods would produce it
in a few days. <
A lively contest is expected to at
tend the distribution of the estate
left by the late "Mammy" Pleasant. A
report has gained . circulation that
Mrs. Pleasant, a few days before her
death on Monday, executed a holo
graphic will, in which she bequeathed
all her interests to Mrs. L. M. Sher
wood, in whose house on Filbert
street she passed her last days. It
is known that another will, signed by
Mrs. Pleasant about a year ago, is in
existence and will be filed for probate
during the next few days. , It is ex
pected that If the Sherwoods have
the other will, of a later date, ' they
will waste no time in- producing it and
the legal fight '' will ensue. On the
day Mrs. Pleasant died Lyman M.
Sherwood admitted at his home that
the colored woman had made a will
during the time she was lying 111 at
his home. Further than this admis
sion, however, he declined to give
information concerning the document.
"I may have something to say later,"
said Sherwood, "concerning this mat
ter, but I am not in a position to dis
cuss it now."
Among telegrams sent from this city
yesterday were several to Senator Mark
Hanna, congratulating him upon his
re-election to the United States Senate.
It is .the general talk in political cir
cles that the Republicans will open the
Presidential campaign in enthusiastic
style. Leading orators from every sec
tion of the State will attend the con
vention and address the people. The
biennial meeting at Los Angeles in 1900
and the rally at Ran Jose in 1902 were
notable demonstrations. Elaborate
preparations ivere made by each city
for the reception and entertainment of
the guests. Some of the functions ar
ranged by the San Jose committee were
'Â¦ancp'fd because the delegates were so
intensely Interested in gubernatorial
wire pulling that they dared not take
the risk of absenting themselves from
the convention hall.
The biennial convention of the Cali
fornia League af Republican Clubs will
be held at Sacramento in May. The
celebrated San Jo=e convention of 1902
selected the capital city as the meet
ing place. Alden Anderson, president
of the State League, will shortly issue
a call for the meeting of the executive
committee to consider preliminaries. It
is probable that a date two or tb.rt?o
dais ahead of the time fixed for the
regular State convention of the party
will be designated as the time for club
delegates to assemble in Sacramento.
"The men did not seem Inclined to
move away, so I persuaded them to go.
That is all there is to the trouble."
Emig exhibited a lacerated scalp to
Judge Samuels as evidence of the"
truth of his story that he had been
struck by the grocer. Wixson asserts
that the ax handle is still in commis
sion.
v In an altercation with pickets of the
Bakers* Union who were posted at the
doorway of his grocery, 231 B
street, former City Councilman J. S.
Wixson this afternoon drove off the
union watchers by the liberal swinging
of an ax handle. During the entangle
ment Henry Eralg, one of tlfe pickets,
claims he was struck on the head by
Grocer Wixson. Emig swore to a com
plaint before Judge George Samuels,
charging Wixson with battery. The
grocer surrendered himself at the City
Prison after giving a bond for his ap
pearance In the Police Court.
Wixson claimed that the men were
attempting to interfere with his busi
ness because he was handling Log
Cabin Bakery bread, the bakery at
present being the scene of a strike of
bread bakers.
"The pair of men were standing at
the doorway of my store," said Wix3on,
"and every customer who came In waa
stopped and the men said to them:
'Don't go into that store; It sells unfair
bread.'
"I told the men to leave the store en
trance and I said I had been in busi
ness fourteen years at that stand, and
If only one customer a day came Into
my place I should serve that patron
with what he wanted.

ANOTHER BRIBERY
SCANDAL IN ST. LOUIS
The manaeers of the Iroquois Thea

made a demand upon Coroner Traeger
for the possession of the theater build
ing. They declared that there were
insurance losses to be adjusted and re
pairs to be made and they desired to
get about this work as soon as pos
sible.
Assistant State's Attorney Barnes, re
plying in behalf of the Coroner, said
that the insurance adjusters could visit
the theater at any time, but that neith
er they nor any other persons would
be permitted to alter existing condi
tions in the building until after the
conclusion of the Coroner's inquest.
The South Congregational Church, a
handsome edifice on Drexel boulevard,
was to-day ordered closed by City

no action had been taken upon it by

FEW RECORDS KEPT.
The remarkable condition which ex
ists in the community was brought
ebout by an attack by a negro upon a
white woman, followed by a visit of
a vigilance committee of forty citizens
to the homes of the negroes, all of
whom were ordered to leave Normal
City within ten days. This order
caused consternation among the ne
groes and some of them prepared to
leave, but a meeting was held and
money was raised for buying arms and
all are now prepared to resist the at
tempt to drive them away.
There are thirty-five negro families
in th? suburb and it is said all are act
ing in concert. No demonstration
npainst them has yet b^en made, but
the whites appear determined and
trouble is expected.
INDIANAPOLIS, Jan. 13.â Negro
residents of Normal City, a suburb of
Muncie, have armed themselves and
have notified the whites that an at
tempt to drive them out of the place
tvill be resisted to the death. They also
have published notices in the local pa
pers that they will not leave and that
it is as unjust to hold them as a people
responsible for the acts of one member
of the race as it would be to drive
away all whites because one white man
commits a crime against society.
It Is confessed that a3 thp Republican candi
date for President he could carry New Tosk
State, but Democratic opinion does not confess
that any other Republican could do It. And.
while he has :iot consented to be a candidate
for that office, .the admission Is most signifi
cant. Hanna's strength lies with the working
men, whose cause he always espoused and with
whom, as the employer of thousands, he has
never had any friction. He Is truly a grand
old man.
SALT L.' VIE, Jan. 13.â Perry Heath's
paper, the Tribune, is booming Senator
Hanna for President. Editorially it
says in part to-day:
Frank M. Platt, son of United States
Senator Platt. has requested certain
influential Californians to look over
the California field and ascertain the
sentiment as between Roosevelt and
Hanna, and to do what they can for
Hanna. This is believed to be signifi
cant of Senator Platt's.own attitude.
HEATH BOOMING HAWA.
Governor Durbin is also said to have
told the President- that If Hanna be
came a candidate for President the In
diana and Illinois delegates would be
for Hanna.
Senators Quay and Penrose of Penn
sylvania, having waited for more than
a month for Senator Hanna to issue
the call for the Republican National
Committee, decided that, so far as
Pennsylvania was concerned, the
Roosevelt boom should no longer be
blocked, which fr/ends of the President
assert is the case by reason of the non
issuance of the call. Ignoring the Na
tional Committee, Senator Penrose, as
chairman of the Pennsylvania State
Committee, issued the call for the
State convention which will elect dele
gates at large to the Chicago conven-
"If the President goes at Hanna that
way there will be trouble. If he tries
to make Hanna fish or cut bait he will
find that Hanna will begin to flsh right
away."
Learning of the remark ascribed to
the President Governor Durbin of In
diana called upon Secretary Root and
said:
DURMX GIVES ADVICE.
Another indication that a political
rupture is imminent is a story which
was told to-day by. some friends of
Senator Hanna, who are politically in
imical to President Roosevelt. The
story is this: A party of Indiana pol
iticians were at the White House last
week and the President said:
"When Senator Hanna comes back
from Ohio 1 am going to make him
either fish or cut bait."
CALL BUREAU, 1406 G STREET, N.
W., WASHINGTON, Jan. 13.â A com
plete political rupture between Presi
dent Roosevelt and Senator Hanna is
imminent now that the latter has been
re-elected to the Senate. Many of
Hanna's friends In Congress, in New
York, in Ohio, and in. fact throughout
the United States are .predicting that
the Senator will announce his" candi
dacy for the Presidential nomination
within a few. days.- An evident sign
of this break between,, the President
and Hanna was seen to-day, when Sen
ators Quay and Penrose. decided to
issue the call for . the , Pennsylvania
State Convention, before the national
Republican committee . sends put its
call â an action that is a violation of
precedent and is significant of war be
neath the surface. '

NEW YORK, Jan. 13.â John A. Ben

A petition was adopted and directed
to the Traffic Managers' Association at
Chicago asking that their action in
denying transportation to stock ship
pers be rescinded else the stock men
would be forced to ship their stock as
perishable freight, thus putting the
railroad to extra expense and trouble
to care for them.
A resolution s was adopted opposing
the bill creating a national humane
association on the ground that it would
mean unwarranted interference with
stock shipping. Another resolution was
adopted urging that the railroads make
special rates on pure bred animals &s

class of stock.

A number of Important resolutions
were passed by the convention â¢ during

commission power to adjust shipping

against Bertha Leibbrandt to recover
possession of a portion of the beach
occupied by her bathhouse and $500
damages. The defendant paid $90 for

mistake. An offer to return the money
paid was refused. Legal complications

The Attorney General may take a hand,
for it is claimed the State owns a por

railroad company nor the city of Santa

Colonel W. E. Skinner of Chicago de
livered an address "on "Livestock Ex
positions." ' Â¦ "' *â¢<Â¦ .-â¢ >" - - <-
Colonel c:e. Wantlarid spoke to the
convention on the subject of "Winter
Feeding on the Ranges.!'
The address of *C. .E., Adams of .Ne
braska was read by Colonel .Wilson 'of
Texas,, in the absence, of Mr. Adams,
who; was unable to attend the conven
tion.' The. address, "which was'well'rer
ceived by the";' delegates,; 'explained*. to
the -convention; somef of 'the ''Injurious
effects of a packers', comblnationrupdd
Two sessions of trie day were de
voted to addresses upon this and other
matters of importance to' the stock
men. The afternoon was given over
almost entirely to the packing-house
question. . L - / - f .
This evening >the j were
taken through Portland's .Chinatown,
where the Celestials greeted them with
a brilliant exhibition of fireworks. The
ladies in attendance upon the co'nven
tion were entertained at the Portland
Hotel during the afternoon by the la
dies of Portland.
The business sessions of the conven
tion opened this morning in the Baker
Theater. There was a large attend
ance of stock men.
The feature of the morning session
was the flattering annual report of
Secretary Charles F. Martin. It show
ed the association to.be in a.prosper
ous condition and recorded the ac?
eomplishment of much work of benefit
to the stock raisers. Attention was
directed to ways of accomplishing
more than has been, and active co-op
eration was urged. . â¢
Much time was devoted to the con
sideration of livestock .conditions in
the various States. Among those who
spoke were: E. S. Fosney of Arizona,
Mr. Howard of California, Mr. McMil
lan of Idaho, H. W. McAfee of Kansas,
Charles Wright of New Hampshire
and Jerry Simpson of New Mexico, v
SHORTAGE OF THE RANGE.
The burden of the report of each
speaker was that while conditions of
the market and range are not aa they
would like to have them, yet the live
stock Industry is in good condition. The
majority of . States had grievances on
account of the shortage of the range.
The greatest grievance of the stock
men appeared to. be against the rail
roads. These corporations, -" it was
stated, have caused great suffering to
the stockmen by their- dilatory meth
ods of handling stock, trains.* Stock
cars have been sidetracked to permit
the passage of empty cars and: other
sources of delay- have been permitted
to interfere with the transportation of
stock,'- until the .producer cannot get
his product to market in any sort of
condition. . " , , Â¦
The consensus, of opinion was. that
the interests of the livestock industry
demand the passage. of a law requir
ing railroads .. to handle livestock in
train load lota and make not less than
fifteen miles per hour, including stops,
from point of loading to ' point of de
livery.
It was "suggested that the great. need
of the livestock men is a representa
tive in Congress to take care of: the
interests of the stockmen. The inabil
ity of cattlemen to raise money on their
cattle was .attributed to speculations
in Wall street and the action of East,
ern . capitalists , in drawing in money
from the West. The leasing of. reserve
lands for grazing purpqses .was advo
cated 1 ; by. almost every speaker.
E. P. Lowe of Honolulu, Hawaii,
gave a report of the efforts being made
inthe islands to. develop the cattle In
dustry. He stated that \ a good start
had been; made, but that .there -are
many conditions that are disadvan
tageous to the raiser. ..
PORTLAND, Jan. 13.â The proposi
tion to incorporate a company of live
stock men for the purpose, of estab
lishing Independent packing-houses in
the stock centers of the country to com
pete with the packers', combine and re
store prices on livestock was the all
absorbing topic of discussion in' the
National Livestock Conventlon"to-day.
By unanimous 'vote the convention in
dorsed a sesolution favoring the incor
poration of such a company and the
establishment of the independent
houses. Steps will now be- taken to
raise stock subscriptions to the amount
of $5,000,000 for the purpose of capitaliz
ing the corporation and placing it upon
a financial footing to proceed with the
work of establishing plants for the
purpose, outlined in to-day's discus
sion. (
The ide t . of the' stock men is to have
a co.-poration composed entirely of
livestock raisers who shall be share
holders in the company and directors
of its business affairs. The "plants of
this company are to compete with the
combination plants, giving. the producer
a better price for his stock and main
taining, reasonable prices to the con
sumer. In turn these , independent
packing-houses are to be supported by
the livestock raisers against the^com
bination. Now that the association has
indorsed the plan, which is entirely sep
arate from the organization, the matter
of interesting livestock men in the pro
ject and of securing subscriptions to
raise the necessary capital will be
placed in the hands of committees to
be appointed for that purpose in the
stock-raising States.
Addresses made on the convention
floor indicate that the stock men are
willing and ready to use their money
and. energy in unlimited quantities to
bring about the desired result. The
packers' combination was denounced
as a greedy combine that had not only
taken the profit from the stock raiser,
but now was reaching out to try to
absorb his ; principal. The unanimous
opinion was that the time has come
when the stock raisers must rise and
overthrow this oppressing foe to the
industry.
LIVESTOCK CONDITIONS.
LOS ANGELES, Jan. 13.â Safe blow
ers, whose work proves that -they an
not novices, forced an entrance into th<
bank of Sawtelle, near the Nationa
Soldiers' Home, some time before day
light this morning, blew open the safe
with nitro-glycerin and carried awaj
the strong box containing more ' thar
$1300. The quantity of explosive was
measured so exactly that, although thÂ«
front; door of the safe was blown out,
the windows of the building were not
broken and the interior of the bank
was but little wrecked.
After blowing off the front doors ol
the safe the robbers removed the inner
chest, a steel box weighing 500 pounds,
and taking it on a hand truck three
blocks through the town stole a horse
and buggy from the stable of O. W.
Jewett and made their escape. What
remained of the strong box was found
this evening in a field several miles
from Sawtelle. The box had been blown
open and the money removed. Nearly
$150 in silver was picked up near by.
Some of the money had been blown
a considerable distance. Â¦ V iS'Â« : .
The robbery was committed by three
men who were seen to get off the last
electric car frc-m this city at Sawtelle
last night. The town has no police
protection and the robbers could have
worked all night without being dis
turbed." Complete descriptions of the
men have been supplied to the authori
ties, but no trace either of them or of
the stolen rig has been found.
The bank which was robbed is a
branch of the bank of Santa Monica,
of which a son of United States Sena
tor Jones is president. As a result of
the robbery a general warning was
sent out to-day to all the banks in the
smaller towns throughout this section
of the State. A year ago, when it was
known that bank robbers were in this
part of the country, many of the banks
placed special .guards on duty, and this
plan will again be followed. The detec
tives believe that the crime was com
mitted by the gang. which so success
fully operated In the Middle West last
year.
LOS ANGELES, Jan. 13.â J. A. Bar
nett, who attacked his 14-year-old son
and cut and beat him almost to death
because he objected to the boy joining
the navy, has been found guilty of
"assault with a deadly weapon with
intent to commit murder." According
to.. the testimony given by the boy at
the preliminary examination, his fath
er attacked him while he lay sleep,
slashed him several times across the
face and throat with a razor and beat
him on the head with a hammer. The
lad did not testify at the trial, as the
prosecution was unable to locate him.
His mother, however, who. Is separated
from Barnett, testified against her hus
band. No evidence was offered by the
defense , excepting some expert testi
mony showing that Barnett may have
been insane at the time he committed
the deed. .
John J. Howley, Wynne's chief
clerk, occupied the stand for a brief
timr\ the principal part of his testi
mony relating to the fact that he
suggested to his superior officer the
advisability of examining into the
legality of aipchen's initials and sig
nature placed on leters and requisi
tions by Machen's subordinates.
Wynne said that in the matter of
the purchase of supplies he always
transacted his business with Machen,
the general {superintendent. He said
it was not a part of his duties to per
sonally attend to the direction or
preparation of orders for Groff fasten
ers, or other supplies, nor did he de
termine the question as to whether
the supplies were absolutely neces
sary or not unless particularly
brought to his attention.

rigid cross-examination by Charles A.
Douplass, counsel for the defense,
during which the opposing attorneys
had several tilts, necessitating a word
of admonition from Justice Pritch
ard that they must conduct the case
in peace. The First Assistant Post
master General was i>lic-d with ques
tions designed to lest his knowledge of
the duties of his office. Witness
stated that he often had sisned pa
pers prepared in Machen's division
without examining into their con
tents, because they came to him in
official form and because of the fact
that he regarded Machen as one of
thÂ»? most expert men in the service
and relied on him.

FIGHTING BEEP TRUST.
"The Senator from West Virginia
will admit* that he is one of the mine
owners," said Patterson, and Scott ad
mitted that such was the fact.
Patterson then proceeded to say that
the Colorado Mine Owners' Association
had been more directly responsible
than all other influences for the course
of Governor Peabody in connection
with the recent strikes in the State.
The organization, We said, devoted its
energies to securing the extermination
of union labor, and he asserted that
great injustice had been done by the
use of the militia in imprisoning men.
establishing a press censorship, etc.
Scott said in reply that he had al
ways been a friend of organized labor,
but there never had been "a more tyr
annical or despotic organization on the
face of the earth than that which the
Colorado Senator is championing here
now."
The resolution was referred to the
Judiciary Committee.
Scott then asked for the reading of a
reply from the mine owners of Colo
rado, but subsequently withdrew the
request, contenting himself with asking
to have the reply go to the committee
and be printed and considered with
other papers bearing upon the ques
tion.
The presentation of the papers was
made the basis of a sharp colloquy
between Patterson and Scott.
WASHINGTON. Jan. 13.â To-day's
session of the Senate began with the
presentation by Patterson of Colorado
of a telegraphic petition from the Fed
eration of Labor of Colorado, in session

SCOTT'S EMULSION.
SEVEN FROM ONE.
It has been shown that one
bottle of Scott's Emulsion is
capable of building seven
times its weight of solid,
healthy flesh.
How is this possible? vj:
Because Scott's Emulsion
is one of the richest and most
digestible of foods.
Because Scott's Emulsion
"makes all good food do good.
Nothing of value to the body
is allowed to go to waste.
Because Scott's Emulsion
makes the stomach strong,
the appetite keen- and the
digestion perfect.
- Because Scott's Emulsion

puts new blood in the veins
and feeds the fires of life

FIFTEEX-YEAR-OLD GIRL
IS SUFFOCATED BY GAS
After some days had passed and Por
ter did not return and nothing was
heard about him the Typographical
Union of Fresno engaged Jones to
i search for Porter. This search was un
j availing. No trace was secured and
Jones was compelled to report that Por
ter's absence was as much of a puzzle
to him as it was to any other oeraon.
Since Porter went away Jones has
had Porter's trunk, there being no
claimant for it. This trunk is opened
and has on it a Yale lock, the key of
which was carried away by Porter
when he started out on his unfortunate
trip. By the skeleton that has been
found in Pacheco pass there was dis
covered a key to a Yale lock. Much
more significant, said Jones last even-
Ing in this city, is the fact that the
number and make of the bicycle that
was found in Pacheco pass correspond
exactly with the description supplied
by the bicycle agent in Fresno who sold
the bicycle to Porter. Jones has hunted
this matter up and has made sure of
this fact, so he says.
As there was no reason known to
his friends why Porter should have
committed suicide Jones is convinced
that a* murder has been committed, but
he has no information that leads h!m
to a definite suspicion as to the mur
derer. Since Porter went away it has
been necessary. In the search for evi
dence to locate him that -his trunk
I should be broken open. The trunk con
taired nothing that would throw any
light on the matter in any way.
T, E. Jones of Fresno, who was form
erly a Deputy Shsriff In Fresno Coun
ty, is certain that the skeleton found
recently in Pacheco pass is that of T.
F. Porter of Fresno. Porter left his
home, which was In Mr. Jones' house,
in November, 1397. He was known to
have been In San Benito County di
rectly afterward. He rode on the cars
to Los Banos. Then he mounted his
bicycle and started off 4ooking for a
gcod hunting ground. Since then hs
has never been seen alive by any of his
friends.
James Keenan. a saloon-keeper at
Fifth and Clementina streets, testified
to having seen Lervy and the defend
ant together in his saloon several times
during June and July, and Frank T.
Barns?, a grocer on Clementina street,
testified to having seen them often to
gether. The case will go on this morn
ingr.
After Martin died she told the de
fendant, and they went together to
Mrs. Sutton's home. From there they
w^nt to a grocery on Clementina street,
near Fifth, where the defendant met
Patrick Lervy, and the three went from
there to a Ealoc-n at Fifth and Clemen
tina strcetp, where they had a drink.
The defendant asked l^ervy to stay
up with her all that night. They left
the saloon and went to defendant's
house. Defendant f-ent Lervy on a
message and witness left. The day that
Martin was taken to the German Hos
pital she saw the defendant ta.ke some
thing from his bed and throw it un
derneath. In cross-examination she ad
mitted that at the request of the de
fendant she had got a* prescription filled
st the drug store at Fifth and Fo-lsom
streets.
.SEEN* WITH LERVV
Mrs. Sadie Bower.", sister-in-law of
the deceased, testified to having called
at the defendant's residence with her
husband on August 16 and subsequent
days till Martin's death on August 25,
and she detailed the condition of the
patient. She denied that either she or
her husband had given Martin any
medicine, which was always given by
the defendant except once, when, at
the request of the defendant, she gave
Martin some. Her husband stopped
with the patient all of Sunday night,
August 23. and she and her husband
were there all of the night of August
24. Her husband went with Martin in
the ambulance to the Oerman Hospital
on the morning of August 2*>, and she
wss there when Martin died.
Kytka was asked if he did not tes
tify et the Coroner's inquest that there
had been no attempt to disguise the
handwriting on the prescription, and
he replied that if the transcript said
â¢o it was wrong:.
Expert Kytka was the first to testify,
.And he swore positively that the sig
nature "McLaughlin, M. D.," was made
by the defendant. Elsenchimmel also
testified to' the same effect, but In cross
examination by Attorney Frank G.
Drury he said there had been no at
tempt to forze the name of Dr. Mc-
Laughlin. but only to disguise the
handwriting of the defendant.

SYMMES' COMPLAINT.
Brandenstein wanted to know if
Ward had seen any typewritten reso
lutions relating to the removals before
the meeting of the Health Board. Ruef
advised Ward not to answer the ques
tion, b*Â»cause it was designed to put
the matter in a false light before the
public. Brandenstein wanted to know
if any suggestions had been received
from Mayor Schmitz and A. Ruef, and
the latter objected, as he was not a
public official on trial.
Brandenstein said he would show
that the Mayor was instrumental in the
framing of the resolution, and asked
Ward if he had received instructions
from any one, but Ruef told Ward not
DECLINES TO ANSWER.
Replying to a question of Ruef, Ward
said that it was the intention of the
board to obey the civil service law
and restore to their positions the men
who stood first on the eligible list, even
though they are less efficient than
those belc-w on the list.
"The Health Board !n removing four
inspectors," said Dr. "..'crd, president
of the board, who was on the stand all
afternoon, "was guided by the efficien
cy of the incumbents. There was one
food inspector, John Durham, who was
doing clerical work in the general of
fice and he was removed. The inverse
order o? the standing of the men on
the eligible list was followed in remov
ing them so far as I have any knowl
edge of the same, but if it has not been
I suppose it can be modified. We re
tained the men deemed most efficient
upon reports filed thereon." '
Ward declined to answer a question
of Brandenstein as to the party from
whom he had received information as
t / the efficiency of the inspectors,
claiming, on Ruef's advice, that }t was
a privileged communication from trust
ed officials.
Ruef claimed that the rule of the
Civil Service Commission provided that
employes shall be laid off .n the inverse
order of their appointment - ud not of
their standing on the eligible list.
Ward said that, although four food
inspectors had been removed, the posi
tions of two milk inspectors had been
created, which had not yet been filled.
It was intended to appoint the milk
inspectors from the food inspectors' list.
Ward said.
Judge S'.ack drew from Ward that
Durham was removed for inefficiency,
but the provision of the charter re
quiring written charges to be filed with
the Civil Service Cc-mmlssion against
an inefficient employe had been disre
garded.
Slack stated that Food Inspectors
Durham. Riordan. Mish and Mackey
were removed and Lydon, Murphy, Sil
veira and Clashy were retained, al
though Durham and Riordan were ap
pointed in 1901 and Silveira and Clashy
in 1903. Ward admitted that the se
niority cf service had been ignored in
making the removals, but said the four
removed were loss efficient, than the
four retained.
The Joint Supervisors' Committee on
Finance and Health met yesterday and
began the investigation ordered by the
Board of Supervisors Into the alleged
violation of the civil service law by
the new Board of Health appointed by
Mayor Echmitz In making wholesale
removals among employes in the va
rious departments under its control.
There were present at the investi
gation C. W. Slack* to;. _.nting the
ousted civil service employes; Franklin
K. Lane, attorney for the Merchants'
Association: the new members of the
Board of Health, who had put the
changes Into effect, besides a number
of civil service eligibles, who had lost
their positions.
Abe Ruef informed the committee
that he had been requested to repre
serft the Health Board Jr. the investi
gation instituted by the Supervisors.
"I desire to state," said Ruef, "that
we waive any 'claim as to the legality
of th.3 investigation. There is a grave
legal question involved as to the right
of this committee to review the acts of
the Health Board, but that body de
sires to aid in this investigation."
t Deputy Health Officer Levy then pro
duced the. records of the meeting of
January 9, at which the sweeping
changes among the employes were car
ried out. Levy read 'the resolutions
abolishing the positions of secretary
and others, also creating certain new
positions, raising and- reducing the sal
aries of various employes, and.declar
ing vacant a number of positions.
Chairman D'Ancona said that the
first point to be inquired into would be
the reason for reducing the number of
food inspectors from eight to four, and
whether the civil service rules had
been complied with in so doing.
GUIDED BY EFFICIENCY.
Legal proceedings calculated to pre
vent the Board of Public Works from
removing its employes and filling their
places with friends of the city ad
ministration were instituted yesterday
by Frank J. Symmcs, president of the
Merchants' Association. He filed an
action for an injunction restraining the
board from following in the footsteps
.of the Board of Health and discharg
ing the clerks and others' employed by
the board. When the suit was present
ed to Presiding Judge Kerrigan, he re
fused to issue the -Injunction prayed
for "and assigned the case to Judge
Sloss. The latter also refused to i^sue
the injunction, but issued an order
directing the board to appear before
him a week from to-morrow and show
cause why the prayer of the complain
ant should not be granted.
The complaint contains the allega
tion that the Board of Works intends
and will, unless prevented by the court,
violate the â¢ charter provision govern
ing: civil service, thereby doing irre
parable injury to the city government.
It also recites that the board, unless re
strained, will, by its threatened action,
cause a needless waste of funds by re
rroving competent men and filling their
places with men who will prove'negli
gent and incompetent. Symmes al
leges further that the removal of the
men after the fashion set by the Board
of Health, that is, by abolishing the po
sitions and then creating them under a
new name, is a lawless proceeding,
in that it doe3 not give the men threat
ened with removal an opportunity to
defend themselves and enter a protest,,
It is lawless, also, says Symmes, be
cause the charter provides that no one
shall be removed without first having
ANOTHER BAKER IS SENT
TO THE CITY HOSPITAL
Replying to a question regarding a
conversation Dr. Ward had with ex-
Secretary Emery and ex-Assistant Sec
retary Cameron, In which it is alleged
the doctor said that they had suc
cumbed to the turn of the political
wheel. Ward denied that he meant that
politics was the cause of their removal.
Ward said that Louis Levy, who was
appointed deputy health officer, would
perform the duties formerly fulfilled
by Durham, Emery. Cameron, Clerk
Stanton and Statistician Coffey. Ward
said in answer to Judge Slack's ques
tion that either Ruef or the Mayor had
vouched for Levy, but he did not re
member which, and there was a gener
al laugh.
Brandenstein wanted to know if
Levy,, who filled five positions, was
designated as "Pooh;Bah," and Ruef
replied that his title was "economizer
of salaries."
Ward stated that the board had abol
ished six sanitary inspectorships on the
civil service list and had appointed four
inspecting physicians in their stead,
.who are not civil service eligibles.
Brandenstein informed Ward that one
of the latter â Dr. .Jacksonâwas a den
tist, and Ward said thct fac** would be
sufficient ground for his removal.
, Ward said that larger d-.ties were
designed for inspecting physicians, but
would not say that the sanitary in
spectors were inefficient, Ii ugh they
were not giving all their time to their
duties, which was deemed sufficient
ground for* their removal.. Ward could
not remember who had suggested the
names of Drs. Goodale, Jackson, Glover
and Walsh for appointment as inspect
ing physicians. '
Attorney Lane drew from Dr. Ward
that the Health Board, three of whom
were new appointees, ' id determined
the efficiency of the 'removed employes,
but that Ward and Dr. Stinson had
been on the board for. some time and
had pursued investigations on their
own account. Dr. Ward admitted that
he had not attended any of the. meet
ings of the board: between April 1, 1902,
and January 1, 1900, out of courtesy to
the Mayor, against wl om proceedings
had been issued by the board.
"I did not attend any of the commit
tee meetings," said Ward. "They were
only 'cinch' committees, anyhow."
The removal of twenty-two civil ser
vice men out of twenty-three employes
removed was done only in the light of
efficiency and retrenchment, Ward said.
J. D. Phelan asked Ward if he would
retreat from his position If it were
shown to him that the charter had
been violated in removing civil service
men to make places for friends, and
Ward said that his desire to comply
with the charter was paramount to
1 crsonal feelings.
The investigation will be resumed
this evening at 7:30 o'clock.
* â * +
to answer.
."I object to this line of questioning,"
said Ruef, "as this investigation is re
solving itself into a direct attack on
the Mayor and goes outside its prov
ince of ascertaining whether the civil
service law has been violated."
"This board is not here to be dictated
to nor insulted by air. Ruef," said
Brander.stein. "He is here by courtesy
of the committee and must confine him
self to parliamentary rules. We de
sire to keep the civil service system
intact and we have a right to know
if. the Mayor had anything to do with
the removals."
"I never dictated to anybody," said
Ruef, "and I am the last man to insult
anybody, even a Supervisor."

Why an Injunction Should Not Issue.
TIFE action of the ' new
Board of Health In dis
placing from positions
several employes, who
were appointed from the civil
service list and against whom no
charges of inefficiency were pre
sented in the manner prescribed
by the charter, is the subject of
investigation by the joint
committee of Finance and
Health of the Board of Super
visors. The inquiry, which began
at a session of the joint commit
tee yesterday, promises to take
a wide range. Pointed ques
tions were asked conccrnlnj; the
attitude of Mayor Schmltz and
Abe Rucf . The latter was pres
ent by courtesy of the investi
gating committee and advised
Dr. .Ward, a leading witness, not
to reply to certain questions put
"by Supervisor Brandenstein. The
ousted employes were represent
ed at the session of the joint
committee by Charles W. Slack.
The ilerchants' Association was
represented by Franklin K.
Lane. It is yet an open ques
tion whether the Mayor will
recognize the right of a commit
tee of Supervisors to inquire
into the causes which Impelled
him to assent to the dismissal
of Health Department attaches.
There was a meeting of the
Merchants' Association last
Tuesday evening. The opinion
was expressed that, the recently
reorganized Board of Public
Works intended to remove many
civil, service men. In view of
the danger the association di
rected its president, Frank J.
Symmcs, to appeal to the courts
for an order enjoining the board
against such removals. The pe
tition for -the injunction was
heard yesterday by Judge Sloss.
He declined " to issue the re
straining order, but directed the
Commissioners â¢ of the Board of
Public \Vorks to appear in his
court on Thursday, January 21.
to show cause why the prayer
of. the Merchants' . Association
should: not.be granted. In this
proceeding the Mayor no doubt
will- be ably' represented by
counsel. It Is probable that a
vigorous remonstrance against
government by, injunction will
be submitted to the court. In the
recent political campaign the
charges were freely made that
the Board of Works was top
heavy with high-salaried at
tache?, who rendered the city
very â¢ little service of practical
value. In a sense the Inefficiency
of the board was a municipal
campaign Issue and all the can
didates for the office of Mayor
promised ' to give the subject
special attention.

comes as a confirmation of the reports of. the labor trou

all who have had any thought of leaving their present
homes in the vague hope of profiting by great opportu

South Africa in the immediate future.

A WORD OF WARNING.
German newspapers, of anti-American- tendency, are
deriding their Government and abusing us because we
have not accepted with what they deem becoming alac
rity the statue of Frederick the Great given to the United
States by Emperor William. It is in such incidents
as this that^our experience with yellow journalism
teaches us to be patient with our misguided friends. We
know that the yellow pest has invaded their, dominion
as well as ours and we understand.

- For the sum of $3 he had in cold

cell companion killed a large rat
which had made her way out of a
hole in the flooring. Portalla whittled
away the edges of the hole with the
edge of an old can and there, snug
gled In a pile of chewed newspapers
he discovered four tiny, motherless
mites. Then began the remarkable
affection of this brutal murderer for
these squeaking: bits of animals.
Day by day Portalla nourished them
with scraps saved from his own food.
At night he would keep them warm
by stowing them away next his own
body. As they grew older the rats
came to make this friend their only
playmate; hours at a time they would
spend running in and out of the folds
of the man's clothing, he looking on
meanwhile with a face which was
almost gentle.
At last it came time for him to go
where the prison doors would close
upon him forever. The rats went with
him in a little hand satchel, but at the

A Murderer's Heart.
So far as can be inferred from what
Is known of humankind in former
ages, and of primitive peoples to-day,
there were no business methods either
to men's or women's work in the begin
ning nor for many centuries afterward.
The division of labor seemed to be that
man should bring in the raw material
when necessity called, and woman
should adapt it as beef" she could to
the service of the family. For many
generations mankind simply lived from
day to day. but as experience and need
taught man he gradually grew to think
cf a possible to-morrow and to make
to-day serve by its abundance the to
morrow wherein he should be unable to
be a producer. From this appreciation
of the demands of the future and from
a desire to meet them fittingly has
come the evolution of the modern busi
ness man. keen to make every dollar
count and every step te'.l.
Has woman made like evolution in
her half of the partnership? Has she
bf-en alert to adopt new methods to
simplify her work or to produce the
finished result with less cost? Though
there are more exceptions to the rule
at the present time than ever before,
it still remains the law of custom, as
at the beginning for the man to pro
vide the material or its eauivalent and
for woman to use it as best she mav
for the welfare of the familyâ and so
it must remain. Does woman know how
to use what she has to the best ad
vantage?
Running a house, even of the hum
blest kind, admits of as much business
sense and as much system as is de
manded for the increase r of the mer
chant's trade. That homes are kept
without the use of such mental power
does not change the proposition. There
are- curbstone merchants * â¢ who* carry
their stock in trade-in a 4ray : about
their necks as well as there are mer
chant princes, and more of them.
The carrying on of a house with the
many divisions of labor arising from
It may veil, be likened %o the carrying
on of a large store, and woman may
study the methods jn the one and find
herself benefited thereby in the other".
She has a certain -income. -i on, which
she can depend and which she wants
to stretch to its full capacity. It makes
no difference in this, so far as the fact
goes, whether she has a fixed allowance
of so much a week or whether she buys
as she needs. A certain definite amount
will fce necessary to provide the fuel,
lights, clothing and food during the
year, likewise a certain amount must
be provided for repairs, breakages, new
supplies in furniture, and for labor.
How many women know what propor
tion of the sum allowed them by the
men of the family goes to these various
calls? Yet every business man has like
expenses figured to a fine point, and
so he knows whether he is conducting
his store or factory on the best basis or
not He knows what it costs him to
produce an article, and whether he can
more profitably buy its parts already
made or manufacture them himself
How is It with women? Can they tell
whether It is cheaper to buy bread
ready baked or to make It themselves,
though this is an article manufactured
by women from time immemorial and
used in all households. How many
women know how many loaves of bread
should be made from a barrel of flour?
Probably not one in a hundred, and so
she does not know from what brand
she gets the most for her money.
How many women know what is the
cheapest fuel to be used In the home
for cooking: and heating? Upon the.cost
of fuel often depends the cnawer to the
question whether to r.-.ake for one's self
or to buy ready mad-. It snay be a

kitchen range to buy her bread and all.
foods requiring long cooking, while it
would be an extravr ranee for her sister
to do the same, since Ler range burns
coalman day for heating the room quite
as much as for cooking.
These may seem small things to a
woman, but It is on the attention given
to trifles that prosperity . rests in the
home, and there Is much more waste

The agony must have lasted for only
a few minutes in reality, l>ut It seemed
an eternity before I felt the clutch on
my legs loosen. I kicked with all my
strength, struggled, twirled, and then
felt myself free. I think my zolld boots
must have injured the arms of the oc
topus and compelled him to let so.
It was not until an hour and a half
later that my friends noticed that my
boat was motionless on the water and
came out to see what was the matter.
They found me more dead than alive.
The skin was nearly all gone from my
feet to my knees, and above that It re
mained for weeks as black as a man's
hat. For two months afterward I lived
only on milk.
Altogether I was laid up for seven
months as the result of my encounter.â
Youths' Companion.
I felt his grasp tighten. The pain was
excruciating. With every movement
that I made my flesh was lacerated. I
began to grow weak from loss of blood.
But I never relaxed my hold on the
boat.
that, and I laughed. But this was to
be my last laugh for a Ion. time, for
Just as I had swum tack to the boat
and laid my hands on. the upturned
keel I felt myself seized around the legs
half-way below the kneesâ seized with
such strength and suddenness and
pulled down with such tremendous
force that the boat was Jerked clean
over, and came dow-n on the top of my
head. , -
Like lightning came the truth. I was
in the arms of a devil-fish.
I knew that the water swarmed with
the decdly octopus. I knew- that one
had got me. There was no mistaking
the crasp. Every one ' the devil-fish's
eight powerful arms closes upon his
prey, and he pulls dow- down, until he
drags it to the bottom.
With a desperate kick I freed myself
from "the creature below me. Seizing
the boat, I had my arm under one of
the thwarts when the Cevll-flsh caught
me again.
The extent of these deposits over the
United States is" very surprising. While
they appear at the surface at compara- .
tively few places, they are penetrated
by deep drill, holes almost everywhere
in 'the Mississippi basin, and in the
Hudson River and Mohawk valleys.
From what we have already said of
the origin of chalk, and of the penin
sula of Florida," it is easy to see that
this extensive limestone stratum over
the Mississippi Valley implies in early
geological ages an equally extensive ex
panse of ocean, which was slowly fill
ing up with the "sediment in .some
places, but with sea shells in others.
This limestone is also sought for very
widely for the flux in smelting iron, its
freedom from impurities giving it spe
cial value.:.'.- .
Among the most interesting limestone
strata of the earlier ages are the cor
niferous and the Trenton limestone,
which appear in special development in
the islands of the western part of
Lake Erie, and in an area about Cin
cinnati, though the name was derived
from Trenton, N. Y., where the rocks
were first carefully studied. The cor
niferous and Trenton limestones are
favorites everywhere for burning lime,
while the solid blocks make the most
substantial building material. The
great locks at the Soo were built ,of
corniferous limestone from Kelley Is
land in Lake Erie, like Solomdn's tem
ple, every stone being fashioned at the
quarry and carried directly to its place
in the great structure, many hundred
miles away.
The chalk formations lie in about the
middle of the geological horizon. and
are several million years old.
Coming down to our own time, we
find the process of limestone formation
still going -on with - great rapidity in
certain localities. The peninsula of
Florida illustrates this. in. the most
striking measure. Sea shells are so
abundant all aloiig the east coast of
-Florida Ufa}, they are washed upon : the
shore in windrows, forming indeed the
entire shore line. .-here, as one pro
ceeds to the interior of the State he
finds successive windrows of shells that
have formerly formed the shore line,
showing how the land has grown by
these slow increments. These shells as
they are rolled by the water are broken
up and much of them ground into fine
p'owder, when they, all together, be-
Qome cemented into. a loose rock. The
buildings of that regionâ especially the
old fort at St. Augustineâ are con
structed of this rock, known as co
quina.
In striking contrast with the older
limestone rocks, this on the coast of
Florida is but slightly cemented, and
forms a mass that would not endure the
pressure which rests upon the founda
tions of very tall buildings. But on
going to the other end of the geological
scale, we find in the older formations
limestones originally formed in Uho
same way with those In Florida, but
now compacted into most solid blocks,
having been, as the geologists say,
"metamorphosed" through long subjec
tion to heat and pressure. Still In many
of these very old limestone rock forms
of the shells of which they are com
posed are perfectly preserved, and the
age of the rock is determined by the
character of these shells, the earlier
rocks having been produced by the
more primitive forms of life.
Another interesting locality where
chalk is found is over the hills of Pal
estineâMount Olivet and many of the
summits of mountains farther south in
Palestine, and the hill on which Naz
areth is built, being of that age and
consisting, in considerable part, of pure
chalk.
Rocks of corresponding: age In other
portions of the world are known as cre
taceous, the word being derived from
the Latin word creta, signifying chalk.
These formations occupy^_a wide belt
in the States west of the~liiissouri Riv
er, extending from Texas j into British
America, but there is not very much
true chalk such as we are familiar with
in the schoolroom in this area. The
rocks, however, are made up of a spe
cies of shells, which are very beautiful
and preserve still their iridescent color.
: One oÂ£ Professor Huxley's most In
teresting lectures was entitled "On a
Piece of Chalk." Chalk is a species
of limestone made up mostly of the
shells of minute organisms, which ap
pear to good advantage only under the
microscope. The northern portion of
France and the southern shores of Eng
land are wholly made up -of chalk cliffs,
which present a very striking appear
ance7~the old name for England, Al
bion", being derived from a word signi
fying this white appearance. It is found
that In the deep sea dredgings these
minute organisms which constitute the
chalk formation are still accumulating,
though at a very slo-w rate. Chalk is
therefore supposed to be a deep sea
â¢formation. " I " Â¦

The Story of* Limestone.
Are they who have not the table of plenty the victims
of the incidents of mortality, of weakness and accident?
If so. they are the defective children of the family of
man, and as such in the present social order they are the
heirs of our affection and the free sharers of our plenty.
If is one of the fine elements of" humanity that a defec
tive member of a family enjoys the richest parental and
fraternal love and care. The strong brother and sister
count it no sacrifice to watch and care for the pitiful
weakling.
Society in the same sense is the father and mother, the
sister and brother of the mental or physical weakling
and of the victim of misfortune. What is done for them
is .not charity at all. It is a duty enforced by all that en
nobles those who take it upon them.. No reorganiza
tion of industry and .society can increase or diminish
the affluence of this sweet fountain) of humanity. If
judgment cannot be given to all in the use of equal op
portunity, and if pity's fountain will get no access of
flow and force by reorganizing industry and society, why
should they be reorganized? . .- â¢
The preacher declared that the form of selfishness we
are considering is against the command of the founder
of Christianity. This we doubt. If every industrious
man adopt the policy of dividing with his neighbor every
night the gains of his day's labor, will he have any indus
trious neighbors? But if he, by his gains, increase the
comforts of his own house and the plenty of his own
table and the warmth of his own hearth, will he not be
teaching his neighbors that they can get these things
which he has by earning them as he does? Now, who
is doing the most good in the world, the man who de
prives himself and makes others thriftless, by dividing
with them, or the man who uses his own for himself
and teaches thrift by example? --
We do not cast out the obligation to care for those
who are disinherited of fortune, who with equality of
opportunity have been incapable of equality of achieve
ment. But before we make their presence in the problem
the reason for destroying our industrial and social
structure, let us inquire into the cause of their condition.
Have they gained by industry and lost by deceit of oth
ers? Their judgment was bad; It misled them into spec
ulative ventures, relying on promises of the crafty, to
increase their possessions. No reorganization of society
can artificially create soundness of judgment, or elimi
nate the speculative instinct, or destroy the craft of the
tempter.
The advancement and civilization of man have been
led by the individuals whe had the greatest individual
power over^the resources of nature, and used it to their
own advantage. -This excited the emulation of their fel
lows to go and do likewise; but socialism would have de
manded that the leader divide the avails of his enterprise
equally with those who had not put forth exertion to
imitate him, and progress and civilization would have
been arrested right~there, and would have ceased.
ONE Oakland clergyman recently preached upon
the effect of excessive organization, in labor and
finance, and made an able plea for the fostering
of individual qualities of self-respect, self-confidence and
independence, and for enforcement of the laws which
protect personal rights. Now another . Oakland clergy
man has ably defended organization and combination,
and has expressed the hope that it will extend to the re
ligious world and induce many of the separated sects to
kiss and make up and march on in step. He stated part
of th'e programme of socialism by saying: "There must
come an insistence upon social justice and a reorgan
ization of the industrial structure until every active and
right meaning life shall have its olace at the, table of
plenty. Selfishness, as a social policy, is doomed."
This is the pessimistic view of present conditions pre
sented by the socialist propaganda, and uttered M>y
Laurence Gronlund and Morrison I. Swift. It is an im
peachment of the existing industrial and social scheme,
as inimical to the welfare of man. It omits the personal
equation entirely. It is the antithesis of Dr. Jordan's
declaration that government, civil institutions and soci
ety can only guarantee equality of Opportunity, while
no conceivable system can guarantee equality of achieve
ment. The active and well meaning life is not sufficient.
Added thereto must be the quality of good judgment,
without which the avails of well meaning activity are
not made permanently useful. â¢'
Hoping not to be misunderstood, we affirm that at
that point what is usually called selfishness be
comes the conservator of the gains and benefits of well
meant activity. That kind of selfishness is entrenched
in the scriptural saying that' "he who provideth not for
his own house is worse than the heathen." The table of
plenty which is the vision of socialism carries with it de
pendence upon collective and not individual provision.
Jt has been worked into the socialistic schemes of the
Australian colonies and New Zealand, and there is being
revealed as an influence in the decay of individual qual
ities of thrift and foresight.
Any artificial plan which substitutes collective depend
ence for individual independence takes out of man his
capacity for entire self-support. The law is universal
and applies to man and bird and beast. The bird of
boldest wing, that has sought its subsistence by 4 its
power of wing and beak and claw, if fed and pampered
without its own exertion finally loses its initiative and
becomes a helpless thing. The swift trout of the moun
tain stream that leaps, like a dagger of silver, into the
air. for the insect prey which is its food, if kept in a
pond and fed on raw liver becomes a sluggish and de
pendent creature.

The reporter remembered the card.
He had picked It up from a table in
the. v/aiting-room of the student's of
fice to be sure that he would have the
name correctly. During the interview
the reporter did nervously twist the
pasteboard. To this day he has the
little bit of cardboard, the memento of
a stern chase that ended in a victory.
"You were toying with one of my
professional cards," explained the
young man, "and I thought that It had
been given to you by Detective Bohen.
1 thought, too, that he must have sent
you to me after all and that it would
be all right."
Ten years ago the Addie Gilmore
murder case, with its mystery of the
woman's decapitated head found at
lime Point and the recovery of the re
maining portions of the body In Oak
land Creek, gave the police detectives
and the metropolitan newspaper men
weeks of incessant labor. To the re
porters the searching . for the many
ends to the story was work that called
for severest taxing of mental ability
and physical exertion.
At one stage of the hunt a, certain
young medical student was the object
of pursuit. His testimony was the all
important missing* link, for it "carried
the murdered woman straight to the
house out' of which she never ap
peared alive^ The detectives had been
particularly anxious to hold this evi
dence from the public.
One forenoon the student's name
and his relation to the mystery leaked
out at police headquarters. In an
instant half a dozen newspaper men
were out in hot chase. One of them
found the young man at his office.
Then commenced a siege, The Inter
viewed student refused point blank.
The interviewer pleaded, cajoled, coax
ed, begged and threatened. For an
hour the men's wits measured forces
and at- last the student succumbed,
cast aside police injunction, and told
his story. It was the great chapter
in the mystery from a newspaper point
of view. The story was golden to the
successful reporter.
After it was all over the reporter
one day asked th'e student why he sur
rendered the story.

the recent overwhelming defeat o1 Tom Johnson in Ohio
leaves them without a successful leader of any reputa
tion whatever.
The leadership of Olney means of course a tariff cam
paign. We shall have to fight over again the obstinate
free-traders who persistently desire to "smash tariffs,"
no matter how beneficial may be their effects upon the
country, of what degree of prosperity is enjoyed by all
classes of workingmen under their operation. It will be
sqmewhat curious' to have a fight for free trade in this
â¢country again at a time when in Great Britain itself, the
home of Cobdenism, the common sense of the people is
awakening to an understanding of the folly of the
dogma, and a fight is even now going on for the estab
lishment of a protective system.
In the course of the tariff fight in Great Britain many
things are being said that are. of value to us, and it will
be well to hÂ«*d them now before the excitements of the
approaching campaign distort the public mind into a
condition of such partisanship that comparatively few
voters will be able to impartially weigh. the arguments
of thci opposing parties/ The free-traders in Great
Britain; call themselves "Free Fooders," and assert that
1 the workingmen of the kingdom would be worse off un
der protection than under the present system. They also
assert that many millions of the British people are now
so near the verge of starvation that the lightest tax that
could be placed on imported foodstuffs would be felt by
them as the most distressful of burdens;
Such statements of course carry, their own answer
I with them, for it is self-evident that if free trade has
brought so large a percentage of the British people to
the verge of starvation it is high time to make a change.
: However, the protectionists have not relied wholly upon
that obvious truth to refute the argument of the opposi
tion. They have sought information from Charles
: Booth, who certainly knows as much about the condition
of workers 'of the great cities of England as any man
living, and they have found in him a staunch advocate of
protection, on the ground that even if.it should some
what increase the cost of food, it would nevertheless
help the* masses by providing them with better wages
with which to buy food. ' .
. In his address at Leeds Chamberlain quoted Booth as
saying: "You ask for rhy answer to the question â will
the fiscal proposals you -have laid before the country add
to the cost of living of the. poorest of the population?
My reply is that I do not think they would do so at all/
But if to some extent they should have that result, it
would not affect my opinion of the merits of your pro
posals, since the well being of the poorer classes, not
less than that of the more regularly employed. and well
to-do, depends much more on the general conditions of
prosperity and the fluctuations of employment than on
changes in the level* of prices; and your proposals, if
carried out with reasonable prudence, seem to me likely
to add to national and imperial prosperity."
It is along such lines the movement toward protection
is advancing in Great Britain, while the unteachable
tariff smashers in the Democratic councils are preparing
a retrograde movement toward free trade in this coun
try. The situation is interesting and merits the careful
study of the American people, for it is likely to develop
the dominant issue of the coming Presidential cam
paign.

ran into his. boat. The Maggie was
one point on the port bow of the fer
ry steamer when the San Jose gave
two whistles and starboarded the
helm. He was answered with two
whistles from the Maggie, which
swung on a ported helm, striking the
San Jose on the starboard bow, caus
ing slight damage to the boat's dav
its. ' The witness then backed the fer
ry steamer at full speed and gave,
three short whistles, which were not
answered by the Maggie.
â¢ The case was taken under advise
ment.

Brisbane, well known to most mining
men, has awakened to a new discovery
in gold ore. A rich discovery is re
ported In the "Welcome Stranger" mine
in the Warwick district and holders of
claims thereabouts are muc'.i encour
aged. At a depth of thirty-five feet
a vein was cut which was literally
studded with gold, said to average over
$8000 .to the ton. It is also said that
renewed activity in mining operations
has followed the recent discovery.
New Zealand, as well as California,
is wrestling with the wine adulteration
problem. The Government is attempt
ing to pre/ent doctdring of native
wines, but is not getting
necessary support from the press. A
recent issue of the Sydney Morning
Herald says:
The Minister for ArrlcuUure, Mr. Kldd,
states that the examination of wines under the
provisions of the wine adulteration act is car
ried out under the direction of. the Agricultural
Department. Since that measure became law
no analyses of Australian wines have been
made by the. Health Board officers for the Ag
ricultural Department. Â¦
This explanation Is considered necessary in
order to clear up a misunderstanding which
appears to have arisen in reference to certain
evidence j given by Mr. Hamlet, Government
Analyst, before the select committee of the
Legislative Assembly appointed to inquire into
the use of preservatives Jn food and drinks.
Mr. Vesey R. Gosche, In a letter published in
these columns, stated that Mr. Hamlet was re
ported to have said in the course of his evi
dences "He had found as much 'as 60 grains of
salicylic add to the pint In colonial wine and
23 srrains to the pint is very frequent." Mr.
Goache remarked that this was a most sweep
ing condemnation of our wines, and In the
Interest of the wine industry he desired to
know whether Mr. Hamlet arrived at that
opinion prior to or after the enactment of the
wine adulteration act. We learn, on the au
thority of the Minister for Agriculture, that
Mr. Hamlet In his evidence referred to analyses
he made eight or nine years ago.
Lord Tennyson, the sou of the poet,
has left Australia for good. He has
been holding a colonial appointment
in Sydney for the past seven years, and
according to reports, was rather popu
lar there. On December 7 he sailed
with his wife and two sons for ."merry
ol 1 England," where hereafter he ex
pects to make his home. The expres
sions of regret at his departure were
universal and the loss of Lady Tenny
son to the islands was voice ! far and
wide in the press. It is understood that
Lord Tennyson is to have an appoint
ment under the Crown in either Eng
land or Ireland.
NEW GOLD DISCOVERY.
Cardinal Moran, the head of the
Catholic church in Australia, was
given a most enthusiastic reception on
his return from Rome to Sydney. While
in Pome he was loaded with special
honors by the Supreme ! Pontiff and on
his return he received no less gratify
ing testimr.ials from the people of
Sydney. He arrived on the steamship
Orizaba and was taken in a launch to
the pier. Every vessel in the harbor
whistled him a welcome, and the Lord
Mayor of Sydney went personally out
in a launch to give him a greeting.
A special steamer, loaded down with
children in holiday gowns, and gar
landed with flowers, met the Cardinal's
launch in the bay and escorted him to
the pier. On shore reception, followed
reception. He listened to addresses
from clergy and laity, merchant and
lawyer, and three days were consumed
in assuring the Cardinal that hie was
thoroughly welcome to his home again.
Captain Daniel Evans is dead. This
will be sad news to his many friends
who knew him from the white cathedral
of Callao to the ice-breasted shores of
St. Michael. He was taken ill in Mel
bourne, Victoria, while captain of the
sailing ship Dimsdale, and died in a
private hospital from pneumonia. His
wife survives him and has a residence
at Plymouth, England. â¢â¢
CARDINAL IS POPULAR.
According to the latest papers arriv
ing from Sydney the wheat crop of
Australia this year is exceptionally
heavy. The Berrigan and Finley dis
tricts report crops averaging twenty
five bushels to the acre and the yield
in the southern part of the island is
reported equally heavy. Many farmers
who were mortgaged to -their full lia
bility have managed to clean up all
their debts and the general tone is one
of satisfaction among wheat growers.
Cattle reports fom New Zealand are
not bo favorable. There is a general
complaint that cattle raisers are neg
lecting opportunities. The methods 6f
butchering are said to be crude and
expensive. There is, too. a complaint
in the papers that American beef is
taking the place of Australian raised
meat, notwithstanding that splendid
faciltles are afforded for the shipment
of frozen meat to England. The blame
is latd entirely on the butchering of the
cattle and underneath a bundle of ver
biage one may read a cry for a thor
ough American packing-houce, with its
various processes for treating cattle.

And that cause is \
Care to. know how it works with some people?
A professional Nurse of i5 years' experience and who studied for three
years under one of the most eminent specialists of Springfield, III., speaks of coffee
drinking and its effects, citing particularly the case of her own husband;
"When I married him he was a confirmed coffee drinker, and it had. to be strong or he
missed the stimulant and had headache ; as the years went on the headaches became more and
more frequent, sometimes lasting two or three days, and the coffee must be made stronger.
His stomach became badly affected, headaches became chronic and rheumatic paralysis came on,
commencing with the little finger of the left hand and gradually extending to every finger until
the entire hand was helpless; then the right hand was affected in the same manner, then extended
to his elbows, shoulders and joints of his limbs. His muscles seemed to slowly contract and
stiffen, and at times the pains were so intense strong opiates had to be administered.
"For over 4 years I dressed and undressed him as I would a child; he was so helpless
he could not even remove his slippers or stockings or bathe himself. - After 6 years of such ter-
rible suffering a bad cough set in, coming from, bis stomach, not from the lungs, and he raised
the most corrupt matter I ever saw.
/'The incessant coughing and straining strained the main artery of his throat, and I found
a growth or hard substance coming on the lower part of his neck, which gradually enlarged until
it protruded outward as large as a turkey egg and pressed on .the windpipe so much he could
only breathe or swallow sitting up in a padded chair, a hopeless invalid. The best physicians and
specialists attended him, and the Verdict of all was the sameâ he must die; nothing could save
him. " 'C.-
"I thought coffee made matters worse, and I resolved, unknown to my husband, to try
Postum and drop coffee, so I purchased a package and prepared it according to directions, boil-
ing it 20 minutes after it commenced to boil, then 'scalded a little cream and prepared a small
cupful. I gave him two teaspponfuls and no vomitirtg followed or nausea, and after waiting.
an hour I gave him two more spoonfuls, and he said it tasted good and "did not burn his stomach-
"For a week I continued the Postum, gradually increasing the quantity, and then I be-
.gan to add to each cup of Postum a spoonful of Grape- Nuts food; The doctor said my struggle
was useless â that the aneurism in his throat would grow until it choked him to death. But I
would not give up. He drank nothing but Postum, and the vomiting ceased entirely, the burn-
ing in the stomach was allayed and the cough much easier, with the discharge from the stomach
"At the end of three months, after I began to. give him Postum in place of coffee, he was
actually able to leave his chair and, leaning on my shoulder, walk a few steps, That was over
a year ago, and to-day he can walk to the postoffice, nearly a mile, and back every day, takes
"The aneurism is reduced so much that he lies in bed and sleeps with comfort, while the
stomach trouble has entirely disappeared. His case is considered one of the most remarkable
that has ever been know here in medical surgery.
"You may be. sure coffeehas been banished fronrdur home and Postum, the life-saving
friend, is served at every meal." ( - ~r â¢

W. Van Arsdale's English setter dog
Bell Boy, handled 1)y Babcock, were the
next brace, and ran forty-three min
utes. Bell Boy showed best in speed
and style, and ranged out well. He was
thÂ« first to find birds, pointing in heavy
weeds. Three birds were flushed to his
point- He followed this with two other
good points, but was a trifle overcau
tious in his work. Zep made a num
ber of false points, but later redeemed
himself by . making three points to
which birds were flushed.

.Â«, .j.
Van Arsdale's English setter dog Mc-
Cloud Boy, handled by Babcock, ran
thirty-six minutes in good cover, con
sisting mainly of stubble some twelve
or " fourteen inches high. Both dogs
started fast and ranged well, maintain
ing their pace to the end, although it
was exceedingly warm at this time.
Making a cast through a stretch of
stubble, McCloud Boy winded birds
along a ditch bank and Jumped into a
pretty point on a bevy.
He was a trifle unsteady to shot, but
the find was a meritorious one. Some
of the birds took to cover in weeds .on
the other side of the fence and in the !
stubble, but the dogs failed to estab
lish any further points. Â» Policy Girl
pointed several times, but no birds
could be flushed to her stands.
After luncheon Stockdale Kennel's
pointer Marguerette; handled by Dodge,
and J. W. Flyiin's pointer Nelly Bang,
handled by Coutts, were put down in
open ".country containing good cover
and were worked thirty minutes. It
was quite warm at this time, but both
dogs made a creditable showing in
point work. Marguerette was first to
point In a weed patch, and a number
of birds were flushed ahead of her.
She followed with two more points.
Nelly Bang made two stylish points
meanwhile. Neither dog ranged widely,
but Nelly showed considerable style
and speed, excelling her brace-mate in
these respects.

J. E. Terry's English setter dog Kil
carif, handled by Coutts, and Van Ars
dale's English setter dog Oakley's
Pride, handled by Babcock, were the
next brace to run. and were put down
after the birds had been driven to cover
in a corn field, where they could show
their epeed and range. Kilgarif showed
to advantage here, making several
clever casts. Oakley also ranged out
Â¦well, though not the equal of his brace
xaate in this respect. Swinging back
to the corn, field, the dogs were sent
to find, and it was not long before
Babcock called "Point" for Oakley and
flushed the bird. Kilgarlf next made,
a false point and followed with a point
â¢which he established just as the bird
flushed wild. Next he snapped to a
point on a single and was steady to
fiusb and shot. Oakley concluded the
bird work with a snappy point, after
which the dogs were taken up. Condi
tions in this heat were bad, as the birds
would not He to the dogs and flushed
â¢wild at the slightest noise. The dogs
were down thirty minutes.
DOGS RANGE WELL.
BY <:. W. IIIBBARD.
BAKEIIPF1ELD, Jan. 13.â The all
age stake in the field trials was com
menced this morning on grounds with
in six miles of town. The first brace of
dogs, consisting of C. E. Worden's Eng
lish setter dog. Harry H, handled by
CoottS, and the same owner's pointer
bitch. Pearls Jingle, handled by Lu
cas, v.ere cast off in the field where I
Northern Huntress and Dr. Daniels ran i
their famous race last January. Harrjr j
H started at great speed and ranged ,
out wide, making long casts to likely J
ground. A bevy was flushed, and when
the birds scattered Jingle showed to
pood advantage, scoring four points in
Fhort order. Harry H was unlucky in
finding and failed to make a stanch
point during the beat. Jingie showed
good, perviceable speed and range, but
was hardly up to her form of other
years. Down forty minutes.
The second brace consisted of,W. Â¦W.
Van Arsdale's English setter dog, De
troit Joe. handled by Babcock, and C.
E. Worden's English setter dog, Jay
M, handled by Lucas. They were down
thirty minutes in open territory- Both
dogs started at a good clip, but Joe did
not show the speed of last season and
Jet down considerably before the heat
was over. Jay M proved a fast and
stylish worker and ran well to the end
of the race. No bird work was per
formed by either, although a few birds
had been driven to the weeds and af
forded the dogs limited opportunities
on game.

cast off in an adjoining field and ran
33 minutes. Clip showed a 'little the
better in speed and range, . but the
pointer ran in creditable form, finally
locating a bevy in a patch of alkali
weeds. Clip coming up, established a
point on the same bevy, but com
menced moving up when the birds
flushed, llidget made two more stanch
points and Clip had two rather unde
cided points to her credit.

worked through a patch of sun
flowers and heavy cover and both com
menced to alternately road and point;
on footscent of a running bevy. Finally^
the birds commenced to flush singly at
the edge of the weed patch. Petronella
then established three good points.
Destiny also pointed in a decided man
ner several times, but no birds could
be flushed to her points. . Down 30
minutes.

Negotiations for a fight must now
begin all over again. Young Corbett
has offe-' to fight Dave Sullivan at
Colma. Sullivan lost to McGovern in
seventeen rounds and beat Briggs on
Tuesday night. The latter gave Mc-
Govern a great battle.
Alex Greggains is out of the bidding,
as he has matched Hugo Kelly of Chi
cago with Billy Woods for the 29th of
this, month. Kelly fought a draw with
Jack O'Brien recently^
This leaves only two bidders for the
fightâ the Yosemite Club and Hayes
Valley. Club. The former will prob
ably have the February permit and
the latter the one for March. The box
ers have already expressed a preference
for March and the play may fall to
Morris Levy.
Young Corbett said last night he
would accept a theatrical engagement
If he did not make a match before the
end of this we''-.
On Monday night Mr. Brandon, the
sportsmanlike backer of the Colma
Club, deposited a $1000 check. He in
creased this to $15,000 yesterday after
noon and the money was placed in
bank to the credit of Eddie Graney,
the stake holder.
When they met at Harry Corbett's
last night, while it was understood
Young Corbett would gladly get out of
the Colma affair, he was ready to sign
the articles of agreement. Britt gave
his ultimatum and the Colma Club
people had no redress. Jim Neil said
they had purchased all the chairs from
the old Tivoli to put in the Colma pa
vilion and had gone to. other expense.
OXIiY TWO CLUBS WlJAj BID.
Britt knew of Corbett's demands and
gave the promoters to understand that
he considered himself as great a draw
ing card as Corbett. The Calif ornian
did not want a bonus, but he main
tained that Corbett was not entitled to
one. The club managers took this view
of the case and would not allow the
featherweight a bonus.
In a moment of pique Corbett accept
ed the Colma offer, which was a lib
eral one, and Britt fell in with his
views. The selection of Colma was a
shock to the men who attend all the
important fights. Some of this com
f ment reached Britfs ears! ' It did not
have much effect on him. however, un
til he went to Colma Tuesday night
and took a survey of the place. This
had its effect and he decided he would
not fight there.
If the selection on ( Monday night of
the Colma Athletii Olub by Young
Corbett and Jimmy Britt as the scene
of their proposed battle was a surprise
to the sporting fraternity, a greater
one was in store for them last night.
At the time when it was agreed that
articles would be signed and forfeits
posted, Britt quietly said that after
mature deliberation he had ' decided
that he would not fight at Colma. His
reason was that the building would
not accommodate the people who want
ed to see the fight. In addition he said
it would put the men from, this city to
too great an Inconvenience to reach the
scene of the fight, and when they were
there he doubted if ticket holders could
get the seats for which they paid, ow
ing 'to the lack of accommodations.
Britt had no fault to find with the
club's bid, saying it was a liberal one.
The architect's plans show 4317 seats
in the pavilion, although the club man
agers claim that 5100 people can be ac
commodated. Only 1934 people wit
nessed the Britt-Canole fight and yet
the pavilion had a crowded appear
ance.
The story of why the fight went to
the Colma Club on Monday was com
mon gossip last night at the sporting
resorts. From first to last Young Cor
bett has felt that he. as the champion
featherweight, was a great drawing
card and, as such, was entitled to a
bonus for affixing his name to a con
tract with any club. Morris Levy al
lowed him V/ 2 per cent of the gross re
ceipts for signing to fight Hanlon be
fore the Hayes Valley Club. This
bonus amounted to $1600.

NOTES OP THE TRACK.
Saul of Tarsus, a 10 to 1 shot, should
have won the first race by himself.
Willie See, however, got the big horse
pocketed and cut off on \ the back
stretch, falling back and losing at least
a dozen lengths. He then made a splen
did run from behind, finishing third.
Sir Preston on this occasion met with
more luck, winning. easily at odds of
5 to 1 from Hilary. Hildebrand on the
'favorite Lustig was sadly messed ;
about/running back in the ruck.
Trainer '-'Bill". Murray, the portly
Sacramentan, thought Puss in Boots a
certainty for the third event, a Futur
ity course run. The filly closed an 11
to 5 favorite and after displaying an
encouraging stanza of speed ran fourth.
Kunz on Nullah, a 15 to 1 shot, came
banging along at the end, downing
Modder a neck. Alice Carey ran into
the show. Bell rated Waterpower to
excellent advantage. -
Leash, a 15 to 1 outsider, captured the
mile selling fixture! Hildebrand rode a
weak finish on the favorite, Billy
Moore, losing by more- than a length
In slow time. MacGyle was third. â¢Â¦
Travers must be a far better rider
than Bell, for Colonel, Van did a re
freshing turn in the final six and one
half furlong run. Well backed at 8 to
1, the Colonel made air the pace, scor
ing quite easily ; from Stilichb. Ster
ling Towers, at 20 to 1, ran into the
show. Mocorito, the favorite, lacked
speed, making an indifferent showing
after being slightly bumped on the far
turn. â¢
SAULi OF TARSUS IS BEST.
Seven started in the $1000 handicap
at one and an eighth miles. Oars
man, assigned top weight, 118 pounds,
and ridden by Otto Wonderly. was
played down to 6 to 5 favoritism.
When sent away by Dick Dwyer Faul
conbridge, a 105-pounder. with Lar
sen' up, went out in front and was
never headed, winning cleverly from
Oarsman by a length in 1:51%, a new
coast record. Leader ran third, only
half a length behind the favorite.
Our Bessie came in for substantial
support, but found the company too
aristocratic.
BETTORS ARE SHOCKED.
A downpour of umbrellas, Chinese
lottery tickets and twenty-dollar
pieces would have caused no more
surprise than the defeat of Prince
Brutus. The slashing youngster was
a 1 to 3 choice for the three and a
half furlong scramble, and if the ef
fort Hildebrand furnished is the best
that rider has to offer the judges
should never permit him to ride an
other race. It was a criminally care
less exhibition. T6 be sure the colt
was inclined to run out on the turn,
a thing he never did before, but this
did not appear to discomfit Hilde
brand. 'even with Marie J nearly two
lengths ahead of him. He took mat
ters leisurely, throwing out the im
pression that he could nab Marie J
whenever desired. At the wire the
latter filly, piloted by Johnny Daly,
scored easily in 41% seconds. This
is the coast record, . but it goes for
nothing and does not explain away
the favorite's showing.
So fast is the track just at present
that a fresh milch cow plated with
roller skates could be shoved along by
a one-armed programme seller and
cover the distance 'in 41%. It is the
city of New York to a Chinese junk
that Prince Brutus can carry a ton
of coal and beat Marie J, and this
race goes for those who argue that
Hildebrand was' too light to do jus
tice to the colt.
Flushed with victory, gained in many
a savage onslaught on the bank rolls of
the unfortunate bookies, big and little
bettors alike were caught in an en
filading fire at Oakland yesterday, and
were fairly riddled.
"When the massacre .of the six favor
ites had been made complete and the
smoke from the battle field had cleared
away, the winnings of the ring were
estimated at 5S0.000. It was one of the
most disastrous innings ever experi
enced on a California track by the so
called talent*
For days and days, many .of the
books have patiently suffered severe
reverses, waiting for the "eagle bird"
to hover near, and at last he came.
Twenty-one- books laid odds and
among the big Avinners were: Joe Yea

Right in rotation Lustig, Prince Bru
tus, Puss in Boots, Oarsman, Billy
Moore and ' Mocorito were carried off
the field by the ambulance corps. One
dollar parlayed on the first five win
ners, Sir Preston, Marie J., Nullah,

M m^2 Â«XHE PAIN ICIISTOir
Those who have ever felt its keen, cutting pains, or witnessed the intense
suffering' of others, know that Rheumatism is torture, and that it is right-
ly called " The King of Pain. "' V' . â¢ .
All do not suffer alike. Some are suddenly seized with the most excrucia-
ting pains; and it seems every muscle and joint in the body was being torn
asunder. Others feel only occasional slight pains for weeks or months, when
a sudden change in the weather or exposure to damp, chilly winds or night
air brings on a fierce attack, lasting for days perhaps, and leaving 'the pa-
tient with a weakened constitution or crippled and deformed for all time.
An acid, polluted condition of the blood is the cause of every form and
variety of Rheumatism, Muscular, Articular, Acute, Chronic; Inflammatory
and Sciatic, and the blood must be purged and purified before there is an
end to your aches and pains. . External applications, the use of liniments and ,
plasters, do much toward temporary relief, but such treatmentdoes not reach
the real cause or cleanse the diseased blood ; but S. S. S., the greatest of all
blood purifiers and tonics, ddes cure Rheumatism by antidoting and _ neutraliz-
ing the poisonous acids and building up the weak and sluggish blood. It is
-, safeand reliable in all formsdf Rheumatism. Itmakea
/^Â¦^ /^â^ /f-.^ the old acid blood rich, and the pain-tortured mus-
NL^y cles and joints are relieved, the shattered nerves are
hwNi h*wy h^O made strong, and the eziiresystem is invigorated and
**Â«-^ ***m^ toned up by the use of this great vegetable remedy.

the musicians included the principal
towns and cities between Stockton,
Cal., and Vancouver, B. C. The va

LULL IX RIGHT OF WAY
FIGHT AT GARDEN CITY
Contending Railway Corporations
Await Result of Injunction Pro
ceedings Commenced Tuesday.
SAN JOSE. Jan. 13.â There is a lull
in the controversy between the Inter
urban Railway and the Southern Fa
ciflc Company pending the hearing of
the restraining order issued last night
by Judge Tuttle enjoining the Inter
urban Company from proceeding with
laying a crossing at San Carlos street.
The hearing is set *Â°r Friday morning.
Senator Louis Oneal, who represents
the Southern Pacific, stated to-day that
the point at issue is that the Interurban
Company had not proceeded in a lawful
manner fo get the right to cross the
Southern Pacific tracks. He thought
the material taken last night by the
Southern Pacific would be returned, as
Vhe railroad had no use for it.
G. I. Battelle. the roadmaster of the
Southern Pacific, who was arrested last
night on a charge of grand larceny for
taking material belonging to the Inter
urban Railway, was arraigned before
Justice Davison to-day. His prelim
inary examination was set for January
21. He is at liberty on $2000 bonds.
The sympathy of many of the people
of San Jose is with the Interurban Rail
way. Ever since the construction of
the mad between San Jose and Sara
toga and Los Gatos obstruction after
obstruction has been placed in its way.
It had no sooner won an injunction suit
on South Market street than the citi
zens on North Market street tried to
etop the road from going down that
thoroughfare. For the past month work
on the road on North Market street has
been tied up because of an injunction
secured by the San Jose and Santa
Clara Electric Railway, which claimed
that the Interurban by refusing to lay
a third rail for it on that street had
violated a contract. This case was sub
mitted for a decision to Judge Tuttle
yesterday. Now the company is again
tied up by the action of the Southern
Pacific at the western limits of the city.

The label of the Painters* and Dec
orators' Union was adopted and will
be recognized throughout the State.
This action followed the difficulty over
the Acme Theater curtain In Sacra
mento some weeks ago, it being claimed
that it did not bear the, union label, al
though it was said to have been paint
ed by union workmen in San Francisco.
It developed that the trouble was due
to the absence of a label recognized by
union painters in different parts of the
State, and to-day's adoption of an of
ficial label for the craft will prevent
misunderstandings in the future.
Various changes in the by-laws were
proposed and adopted, especially one
regulating the matter of apprentice
ships. Resolutions of appreciation
were passed for the hospitality ex
tended by the Sacramento Building

in declaring the convention was one of
the most profitable heM since the coun

Special Dispatch to The Call
NEW YORK, Jan. 13.â The Noord
land ordinarily makes the run between
Liverpool and Philadelphia In about
eleven days. Steamers which have ar
rived "during the last few days have
experienced severe gales nearly air the
way across the Atlantic and under the
circumstances the Noordland is now
about two days behind * her regular
schedule.
â¢PORTLAND, vMe.,> Jan.' 13.â The
Â¦seamer Cornishman, which arrived to
':day from Liverpool, reports that on
January 2 she sighted, the. Red Star
Line" steamer Nbordland. Liverpool- for
Philadelphia, in a disabled condition.
The Noordlarid was hove to during 'a
.gale and displayed two red llghts,*slg
naling that she was unmanageable.
Owing to the heavy.seas, the Cornish
man lost sight of her. The captain of
the Cornishman said that the Noord

gale safely and he believes she must
have made temporary repairs. The
Noordland sailed from Liverpool De

The Supreme Court's decision leaves
undetermined the Question which was
raised as to whether or not the Ha
waiian Legislature had the authority
to establish an elective county govern
ment system.
This decision, which was rendered in
a test case, invalidates the results of
the November election for Supervisors
in the five counties of the Territory.
All of the boards of Supervisors have
held sessions since the 4th inst., and
most of the officials elected have as
sumed c-fflce. An exception is Curtis
Iauuea, Assessor-elect of Oahu County,
whose bond of J150.000 was rejected by
the Supervisors on account of its ille
gality.
Governor Carter is considering the
question of calling an extra session of
the Legislature to remedy the present
conditic-n tff affairs. The Territory is
without appropriations. There is no
provision for the police, as the taxes
for this bureau and many Withers were
intended to be raised by the various
counties.
HONOLULU, Jan. 13.â The Supreme
Court cf the Territory of. Hawaii to
day decided unanimouply that the
county government act. which went
into effect on January 4, is void in
fts entirety. The court declares that
taxation features were illegally incor
porated in the measure and that the
act cannot be made operative without
them.
Representative Baker of New York
offered a resolution looking to the.dis
armament of the armies and navies of
the world. \ This resolution was re
ferred to a committee of five, to be ap
pointed later. The committee will draft
a platform and obtain the signatures
of the members present.
Representative Hitt of Illinois, chair
man of the Committee on Foreign Af
fairs, predicted that the movement for
peace would find enthusiastic favor
"with the people of this country.
He said he believed that the House
would agree to Bartholdfs resolution
when it was explained. It meanCrellef
from jthe great burden of taxation for
supporting armies.
Representative Hepburn of Iowa sup
ported the idea. He said that fully one
fourth of the Federal taxation had been
expended for war. Over 400,000 of the
youth of the country had died in, a sin
gJe war. This war cost in treasure six
billions of dollars and since that time
three and a half billions had been paid
in pensions.
It was decided not to adopt the ex
act language of the Bartholdt, resolu
tion, but to indorse its purpose and au
thorize him to introduce it in the
House.
Thomas Barclay of London, formerly
a member of the English Parliament,
was heard briefly. He explained^ that
the British House of Commons' had
formed a "committee" instead' of a
"group", and suggested the possibility
of sounding the American Congress and
the British Parliament on the subject
of a joint session of the parliamentary
"group" just organized here and the
"committee" of Great Britain to estab
lish even more cordial relations be
tween the two countries.
Bartholdt made the statement that
President Roosevelt was in hearty
favor of the organization of the group.
he said, was the only nation not having
a "group" of parliamentarians affili
ated with the Inter-Parliamentary Un
ion for International Arbitration. This
union, he said, has decided to hold its
twelfth annual conference at St. Louis
during the first week in September
next. It was, he said, not only fitting
but necessary that a group of parlia
mentarians, consisting of Senators and
members of the House of Representa
tives, be organized and to have a reso
lution extending an invitation to the
union and making an appropriation of
$5000 to defray the expenses of the ses
sion agreed to by Congress. The first
business, he said, was to organize a
"group."
On motion of Representative Shafroth
of Colorado the meeting resolved to or
ganize a group.
Bartholdt presented a concurrent
resolution for adoption by the "group"
to be Introduced in Congress. The reso
lution extended the invitation to the
international union to met in this coun
try and made the necessary appoint
ment.
TJie session was called to order by
Representative Bartholdt, who was
elected chairman. The United States,
WASHINGTON, Jan. 13.â An Ameri
can "group" to be affiliated with the
Inter-Parliamentary Union for Inter
national Arbitration was organized to
night at a meeting held In the lobby of
the House of Representatives. About
forty members of the Senate and the
House of Representatives became mem
bers.
VICTORIA..B. C, Jan. 13.â The up
per works of the lost steamer Clallam,
including the main deck, which appears
to have been torn apart from the hull,
with the deckhouses and saloons and
staterooois, is at Sidney, having been
taken there by the United States reve
nue cutter Grant, which took over the
wreckage from the steamer Maude.
On the way to Victoria the Maud?
picked up a body near Trial Island,
which is believed to be that of Colonel
Thompson, a well known Tacoma min
ing man.
At the Coroner's inquest, which com
menced tcr-day, evidence was given by
Edward Lannon of Montana that no
distress signals were made by tha
steamer Clallam. He testified that
about 4 o'clock, an hour after the wom
en and children and those in the boats
with them had been drowned, a steam
er had oassed within a mile of the
sinking vessel, whose fires had already
been put out by the .inrush of water.
No attempt was made to attract the
attention of the vessel. When the tug
Holyoke picked up the Clallam about
10 o'clock a number of passengers ask
ed Captain Roberts to put them on the
tug, but he refused. The sea had gone
down somewhat and the passenjjers
cculd have been transferred. No ore
was taken from the steamer when she
careened and rolled over at the climax,
all who were rescued by the tugs be
ing taken from the water.
The British cruiser Grafton has re
turned from a cruise and reports hav
ing found the botiy of Bruno Liehman,
the customs officer of the Clallam. off
Rare Rocks. Lehman sprang from the
upper deck of the steamer Into a boat
which was filled with passengers, most
ly women and children, and was swept
out with the boat when she swamped
almost immediately afterward.

SALT LAKE, Jan. .13.â Another r6

combined snow and thunder storm has
occurred at Park City. In "the . Scot
tish Chief mine two ,men, while Â¦ at
work 500 feet under ground,- were
struck by lightning arid badly injured,
though they will recover.
Following an all-day . snow storm'
there was a momentary lull and then
an electrical disturbance of great fury
burst over the Rocky Mountains. Great
flashes of lighting turned night Into
day temporarily and terrific .peals of
thunder were heard. ' .: '
James Malone and John Roberts were Â¦
at work on the 500-foot ' level of the
Scottish Chief. . Following en unusually
loud peal of thunder a bolt of light
ning struck the underground track at
the mouth of the tunnel, and, following
the rails, passed In a flash to" where
Malone and Roberts were at work.
Both men received a terrific shock.
Roberts was rendered unconscious. Ma
lone fell to the floor of the tunnel and
both were very badly burned. They
were unaware of the storm and were
under the impression that an explo
sion had occurred in the mine,.
When Roberts had recovered con

NEW ADVERTISEMENTS.
If you see a woman or a man with lux-
uriant glossy hair, you may. be sure nei-
ther has dandruff to amount to anything.
In, nearly every case where, women and
men have thin brittle hair, they owe it
to dandruff. There are hundreds of prep-
arations that "claim" to cure dandruff,
Â¦hg^tint one but Newbro's Herpicide' tells
you that dandruff is the result of a germ
burrowing into the scalp, and that per-
manent cure of . dandruff . and . its . conse-
quent i falling and. baldness, can only be
had by killing the germ; and there Is no
other .preparation that 'will destroy that
germ " but - Newbro's â¢ Herpicide. ; "Destroy
the causo^and. you remove the effect,.'

PRESERVE THIS SERIES TO BE BOUND IN PORTFOLIO FORM Â£
Greater San Francisco's Greatest Dally scores S3
again with an entirely new Sunday feature. 3
By an exclusive arrangement, secured at an enor- jâ¢
' mous cost, THE SUN'DAY CALL will be the first to S
issucthe WORLD'S FAIR OFFICIAL ART SERIES, |j
* reproductions In color of the grounds and buildings ?
of the Louisiana Purchase Exposition.- ' U
7 '' '.'"/' , ~ "~~'"~~ ~7T7^ b
- SIACHINERY HALL. Â§
THE FIRST OF THIS SER IES WILL BE ISSUED |
I SUNDAY, JANUARY 31st | | Â¦
The original of that Sunday's Art Supplement Is â¢ 9
the first artistic reproduction showing the arcliltec- jj
tural beauty of the Ivory City, and is selected as one pf
of the best of | the many views submitted, it being the B
object to combine in a limited series the most import- H
ant and interesting features of the St. Louis World's
Fair. > .^ g
The Palace of ( Sfachlnery, representing power, R
force, in reality the pivot on which this immense ex- H
hibition revolves, is the ina neural issue of what will ~
doubtless prove the most Interesting series that was S
ever given free by a publication. g
The main entrance to this building shows a triple B
arcade, with large pavilion in the center. The north Â®
front, which is thirteen hundred feet in length, bas an/ Â§
arcade'of nine arches as a center feature. j^j
Following the classical In nrchitcctnral effect,
there are fonnd several beautiful examples of the Ital- S
ian and Spanish Renaissance styles. The brilliancy of Â»
color, the realistic scene, with the moving crowds of rj
sightseers, give variety and animation to the picture. 0
Nothing is so universally attractive as power. Men,
animals and nature are most fascinated when, by
its exercise, they, demonstrate possession of cxtraor- g
dlnary power. Admiration . for might and. theydeslre a
to see it in evidence, to feel it and sense it, to remem- â¢ B
ber it and to tell of it, are instinctive . factors with B
men, women and children. This is the keynote to the O
collection and aiTangemcnt of the exhibits hi the 3Ia- 5j
chinery Departmentâ Power. Here are shown the |j
methods and means for creating every variety of ma- a
chinery for the generation, transmission and use of S3
power. 5J
Forty thousand : horses harnessed together and S
pulling! with one mighty concentrated effort convey Â¦
the idea of the total power which makes the wheels 51
of this World's Fair go round. The engines, con- El
densers, pumps, moving machinery and accessories B
making up the power plant, which Is the largest ever Â§
shown at an exhibit, are installed on the main floor H
of 3Iachinery Hall and occupy the entire westerly half â¢ H
of â¢ that .- building â an area of something over 200.000 Â» a
square feet, or about the size of an ordinary city
block. Â»
There will doubtless be an unprecedented demand w
for this SERIES. Nearly every one will want to pre- a
' serve them to be bound In PORTFOLIO FORM. U

The Pacific j Coast Steamship Company'*

Humboldt River bar, was found to have
knocked a. small hole In her bottom.
Somebody, supposedly a discharged employe
of the Hunters Point Drydock Company, cut
some of the ropes attached to the bilge blocks
prior to the docking on Tuesday afternoon ot
the army transport Meade. The blocks had to
be put in place by hand, which considerably
delayed the operation. The transport was not
endangered by the act of vandalism, but the
perpetrator will be prosecuted If his identity
can be positively established.
The- Pacific Mail Company's big- freighter
Algoa is due in a few days from the, Orient

The bark Santiago was docked yesterday at

before going on the dry dock to repair, the
damage done her port Quarter by the steamer
Rainier.

The army transport Sheridan is due to-day
from Manila.
The Commissioners instructed the
chief wharfinger to enforce the rule
compelling wharfingers and collectors
to wear full uniform while on duty. The
board ordered the payment Â«.f $1000 to
ex-Covernor Budd as a fee for services
rendered in the suit of Holmes and
Uhlig against the State. The chief
wharfinger was authorized to spend $250
for a new horse and $200 for a buggy!
The old horse and harness were sold
for $55.
The Harbor Commissioners yesterday
awarded to John F. Rooney, brother-in
law of President ' Charles Spear, the
exclusive privilege of conducting news
stands at the ferry depot at a monthly
rental of $1200. Foster & Orear, the
present tenants, whose tenancy dates
back twenty-three years, were Â§riven
thirty days* notice to vacate. The adop
tion of the Rooney resolution was by
unanimous vote, but the matter is not
yet closed, for at. next Wednesday's
meeting: Foster & Orear .will be on
hand, they say, with good and suf
ficient reasons for setting aside the
Rooney proposition.
When President Spear first tried to
secure the news-stand privileges for
his brother-in-law, Foster & Orear
were paying a monthly rental of $430.
In a resolution introduced three weeks
ago by Spear the rent to be paid by
Rooney was fixed at $600. Foster and
O'Rear saw Rooney's $600 and went
h m 5580 better, offering a rental of
$1180 a month and asking the privilege
of bidding against any higher offer
that might be made. President Spear
eagerly declared the Foster & Orear
o.Ter an absurdity and moved the
adoption of the $600 Rooney resolution.
To this Commissioner Kirkpatrick
would not a'gree and the matter went
over until yesterday.
Meanwhile Foster & Orear sent
to the Commissioners a certified check
for $1180 for their first month's rent
under the new arrangement. They fur
ther offered to put up a $10,000 bond as
security for future payments. In spite
of this evidence of good faith, however,
the board yesterday gave Foster &
Orear no opportunity to bid against
the Rooney offer, but awarded the
privilege to the latter at $20 advance
on Foster & O'Rear's bid of $1180 a
month, making the rental $1200 a
month.
Whoever gets the much-sought priv
ilege the State will benefit by $770 a
month and the Harbor Commissioners
have some basis for finding out how
much the tax-payers have lost by the
board's failure to realize the commer
cial Klondike developed by the indus
try and sagacity of one of the State's
tenants.

vThe firmness In Hay and FeedstufTs con
tinues, but prices show no further change of
importance. Straw is higher. Dealers report
that there ts more Choice Hay on the market
at precent than ;lower trade, as buyers are
taking the latter In preference, owing to it3
cheaper nrlce, and H glvlng fine Hay the go-by
as far as they can. .
The circular of Somers & Co." says:
â¢"The total arrivals for the past week
amount to 2550 tons, 750 tons more than for
the preceding week.
. "TrHde, both local and foreign, is very brisk
and this activity, with the long-continued dry
spell, has forced prices up again until now they
range from $11 ; qer ton on the cheapest Hay
to $17 60 rer ton on choice Wheat Hay. From
Los Angeles and all southern counties there Is
a big demand for Hay and reports come to us
from interior points that much Hay is being
shipped'to the south' of us. Iflg a certainty
now * that : there will be no hold-over stock on
hand at the end of tho season, and should this
prove to be a dry year there will be a serious
Hay .famine:, in thia State. The market at
present is very sensitive; in fact much depends
on the' weather. ..If . it rsbouidc continue dry
and cold fof a week or two longer prices un
doubtedly will make another material ad
vance, although 1 we think . that Â¦ , .even . If it
should rain shortly prices will not drop, as we
hive Â¦ enough export orders . before us to 1 war
rant the '. belief - that arices will not decline
from the present range. Â¦Â¦ , ..r. ->Â¦ .Â¦
Â¦Tit has been reported that the Government
Is .in the market* for 1000 tons more of. Hay
but as yet .we have Â¦ heard nothing officially
in this connection. Â¦Â¦' Â¦ .Â¦ Â¦ - .-./.
.>"As. we have reported above, the regular
quotation on choice Wheat. Hay Is $17 50 per
ton.* but an especially fancy car will sell for
$18 Â¦ oer "ton. From ; present Indications we
would > not- be'- surprised to see â¢ this ' latter
figure the regular price for the choice grades of
Wheat Hay in a" very short time."

STOCK MARKET.
CHICAGO, Jan. 13.â The pit was generally
bearish in wheat to-day and sold on the
slightest provocation. As an offset to this
selling pressure, the leader of the longs was
an active buyer throughout the session. B6
fore the opening Liverpool' cables showed
losses, while British conso s were higher The
Inference was that peace between Russia and
Japan was etill within the possibilities, as
a result of these Inferences the market here
opened easier, with May tt@%c to- V4@%c
lower Rt 8ti"Â«c to 87c. Commission houses
were liberal sellers and offerings were taken
largely by the prominent bull Interest. Dur
ing the first hour the demand from this source
carried May up to S7Â«,Â©87V4c. but when the
buying lessened the price slowly sagged until
86%c was reached. There was good. buying
â¢on the decline by a number of commission
houses and elevator interests. Within the
last few minutes of trading the firmness
changed to decided strength on renewed pur
chses.by the big long. Closing prices were at
about the top figures, with May at 87Vic.
The domlnÂ«mt_influence : in corn was the
small receipts, poor grading and good cash
demand. The market was firm all day, May
closing %"5 %c higher at 47%c.
Oats were very strong. May closed at 40>4c.
Light receipts of hogs, an advance in prices
at the yards and liberal shipments of prod
ucts maintained a etronir tone in- provisions.
Closing price* were near the top, with May
pork up 17^4c to 20c, lard 7%c higher and
ribs up 10c.
The leading futures ranged as. follows:

The jCltrus market was heavily stocked and
trade continued quiet owing to the cool
weather. Oranges are running rather small
this year and large sizes of fancy Navels are
comparatively scarce. Such sizes of well
known brands of extra' fancy are firmly held
at the top quotation, but it Is difficult to ob
tain $2 per box for the ordinary run of fancy
stock. At the auction sale 4 cars of Navels
were sold as follows: Extra fancy $1 75tf?2
ordinary fancy, $1 40<gl 00; choice, $l@l 40
standards, 75cj?$l 30. The attendance at the
sale was fair, but the bidding was slow and
less than half a car was sold to outsiders the
balance being bought in by the promoters of
the auction. The prices obtained were ficti
tious and not Justified by market conditions
or the quality of the fruit.
The licai demand for Apples showed some
Improvement and dealers reported the market
gradually working into shape. Should receipts
continue light for a while longer the market
will clean up and prices may strengthen. Pine
apples are quoted lower, the demand being
light, owing to the cool weather

weak at the decline, with buyers holding oft
and looking around for bargains.
Receipts were 25,300 lbs Butter, 8S0 cases
Eggs and 3000 lbs Cheese.
The demoralization in Cheese continues but
prices are no lower. The demand is very
poor.
Owing to insignificant receipts from Hum
boldt at nresent the Butter market is but
meagerly supplied with fine creameries, and
these descrlptior.3 are accordingly firm and
tending upward. Most of the smaller houses
quoted 20c yesterday, but the larger ones did
not quote over 27H ( 928c. The general opin
ion was that quotations would make a furthar
advance.
Butter, Cheese and Eggs.
"Market about unchanged. It developed a
llttie weakness through the early part of the
day on shade lower consols and lower Liver
pool, but on the eoft spots it had Armour sup
port. â¢ There is the name c(ash situation as
heretofore, consisting of large receipts, poor
! demand and accumulating stocks. Advices re
garding the Eastern situation are still in
definite and matters have no doubt reached
the critical point. Scattered interests in this
market on both sides have been largely.elim
inated. With two such incendiary influences
working as war and the heavy Armour trad
ing commitments either way are being ma
terially restricted. This Is no doubt wise, and
until the ordinary commercial Influence ?Â¦be
comes operative we advise conservatism and
think that Interests whether long or short'

NEW YORK. Jan. 13. â The Inert stock mar
ket to-day seemed to reflect no development in
affiir.-, but the stagnation of the market was
In itself a result of the uncertainty over ,the
outcome of the Far Eastern crisis. The same
effect was caused in the various commodity
markets, .which have shown themselves under
the influence of the war news, and the for
eign securities market was practically idle to
day. These markets were evidently waiting,
all of them, for some more definite shaping
of the luture of events. The constantly vary
ing rumors of each day regarding the chances
of peace or war seemed to-day to have lost
their power for Inducing active operations in
the markets. The serious possibilities involved
In the situation are abundantly realized, and
the conclusion seems to have been reached to
shut down and await the outcome. In the ab
sence of speculative demand tor loans the
offerings cf call money became so large to
day an to suggest an early stage of . plethora
in the money supply. Funds still continue
to pile up at this center by Tecelpts of cur
rency from the interior and by some belated
arrivals of foreign gold. ' Only a handful of
miner etocks moved widely to-day, with rather
palpable evidences of manipulation to account
tor the movements. At the same time there
was a conspicuous falling oft In the rate of
activity of the few prominent stocks which
have made up the bulk of the dealings in the
recent dull markets, euch as Amalgamated
Copper, Pennsylvania and United States Steel
preferred. The uncertainties of the war out
look are contldered sufficient explanation of
the indisposition to trade, but Influence is ex
erted alMi by. the large amount of railroad
borrowings banging over the market, and
which are competently estimated at above
$300,000,000. The possibility or an unheralded
decision being unexpectedly handed down in
the Northern Securities case Is another factor
making for conservatism In speculative com
mitments. Prices to-day gravitated to a lower
level from sheer inanition, and the closing
was on the down grade.

"Fa^ying of the dividend on Steel common
T\as a foregone conclusion. It was the fall In
earntnff Trcm $13.<i00.G00 in June to something
over $3.<X)0,O<X> in December that caused frt*h
telling in the stock -market, s This was less
than half the earnings in the same month last
yr*r. It was areuvd that if the iron trade
buffered to that extent in December, how about
oth<T lines of industry? This, however, is fal
lacious reasoning. It must be .remembemi
thet an Imrocnw.amount of business waÂ» held
up tcwarci the close of the year by uncer

fipares and wage* had to be reduced. These
difficulties have since been partially adjusted.

' The market ruled firm for all
of table Potatoes and prices were without
quotable change. There were no fresh arrivals
of Oregon or Salinas Burbanks, and conse
quently there was no new business to report.
The lack of moisture in the southern part of
the State has a depressing effect on the sale of
seed â¢ Potatoes. ] Early Rose. Garnet Chiles and
Early Jackson are offering freely for that pur
pose sit prices rnnglnK from R5e to $1 per

disposed to sr>eculate at present. No fr<>?h

LONDON CLOSING STOCKS.
A local house thus reports on Wool: " "Al
though trading In the locaK Wool market has
lacked buoyancy and vigor, the output of the
State has been so limited, especially that por
tion of it seeking San Francisco for a market,
that thÂ«? clips have been pretty well absorbed.
At the beginning ' of the current year there
was not over 3.000.000 pounds of unsold Wool
in the San Francisco market. .'Since then sales
to the extent of a full million pounds have
been consummated and there is barely 2.000.000
pounds to be drawn from and still unsold In
thia market. Prices have not changed for
son:e time and have been maintained with a
good degree ; of Htcadlness. The first London
auction sale for the season takes place on thÂ«
19th ln*t. and a strong market is looked for."

Thieves with a thirst have been bold
ly operating in the ferry building and
Hawkshaws are trying to locate the
guilty parties. The ferry building
shelters various State bodies, one of
w hich is the State Board of Trade. By
reason of the public promotion work
that the Board of Trade Is carrying on
for the good of the State it has been
assigned space for exhibits on two
floors. One of the spaces adjoins the
grand nave, in which several public
functions have taken place. In this
space, which is open all night to all
comers, the State Board of Trade,
something like a year ago, placed an
elaborate show structure, highly orna
mented, and provided with conven
iences for holding selected special ex
hibits illustrative of the resources of
California counties. Among these, are
sundry bottles of different varieties of
vines and brandies of high quality.
For a long time these bottles, con
taining seductive fluids, have been fa
mcus all along the water front. They
have, however, been safe from attack
until lately. Within the last few weeks
some one has evolved a system to get
the bottles out of the show case and to
remove them in safety from the ferry
building notwithstanding the fact that
there is a watchman in the building,
tvho is supposed to have charge of pub
lic property after dark, when the peo
ple who occupy the offices in the build
ing have gone away until the following
morning.
The system of attack is uniaue. To
open the case it has been necessary to
climb to the top of them on a tall step
ladder in order that plugs, tightly
driven into the tops of the cases might
be removed. While the plugs are In
position it is impossible to get into the
cases except by smashing the glass
fronts. The glass has not been broken
in any instance, but the exhibits have
quite regularly disappeared of late.
Jerome. A." Hart took the stand yes
terday morning and' gave 'testimony
regarding the sanity of Miss Isabel
Clark, who committed suicide in'JDr.
McNuttjs hospital, and whose will is
being contested. Mr. Hart made a
splendid witness for the prosecution,
but his ' direct examination was not
completed before the hour of adjourn
ment. His testimony was in the form
of a narrative of events connected with
the life of decedent from the time he
first met her until the time of her
death.
According to the testimony ,of Mr.
Hart Miss Clark was always of a
moody disposition and inclined to be
pessimistic. When her brother, to
whom she was devotedly attached, died
on .August 1, 1898, she collapsed and
from that time on grew gradually
worse. He was" constantly in fear that
she would end her life, and was not
surprised when he found that she had
committed suicide. The witness related
a number 'of instances in which Miss
Clark showed what he considered men
tal derangement. Prior to entering the
sanitarium and while quartered at the
Palace Hotel, the witness testified, Miss
Clark would go around for days with
her hair down and a glassy look in her
eyes. She refused to take food and
would not answer questions addressed
to her. "When it was suggested that
she should go to Dr. Mclvutt's hospital
she did not demur. Witness thought it
perfectly natural that she should go
to Dr. McNutt's hospital as Dr. McNutt
had been the family physician foj
years. .
WAS ALWAYS 3IORBID.
During the period of Mr. Hart's ac
quaintanceship with Miss Clark she
had always been morbid and melan
choly. She never enjoyed the ordinary
sports, such as riding, golf and tennis,
as the others did, but preferred to shut
herself indoors. She would sit around
in neglige costume and request others
to attend to the social duties.
Hart called on her shortly after she
entered the hospital and found her
very much emaciated. She told him,
he says, that her sisters, Grace and
Ann, were soon to be married, that no
one cared for her, and hinied that after
their marriage she would commit sui
cide. He did his best to cheer her up,
but his efforts were fruitless. Among
other things, he claims, she requested
Mr. Hart to marry her sister Ann. She
wished to have the marriage performed
in front of the fireplace in the hospital
and said that* later Grace and Mr.
Strohmwould be married in the same
place. Then she could die in peace.
NEVER RALLIED FROM SHOCK.
In answer to a Question as to his
opinion regarding the condition of Miss
Clark the witness' said: "Her conduct
after the death of her brother showed
she had received a severe shock,, which
disturbed her mental balance, and later
1 saw she had not recovered from the
6hock. She would send for me fre
quently, her only object being to insist
upon her absurd demand that I marry
her sister in the room she. occupied at
the hospital. I saw finally that this
v.as a fixed idea in her mind, not merely
a passing fancy. Her long stay in the
hospital also . tended to convince me
that her mind was deranged, because it
seemed unreasonable that, a woman of
her wealth and social position should
shut Herself up as_^ a recluse. in a hos
pital when she might house herself
more comfortably. Another phase. which
arrested my attention very, much was
the deep concern she manifested over
the illness of her sister Grace, who was
suffering with an affliction of the eyes.
I was visiting the family at the time
and Miss Belle dragged me into the
sickroom against my will."
The witness, also .related a number
of other instances tending to show that
Miss Clark, during her lifetime, was
subject to strange moods and fancies.
He said he had never known her to
transact business of any kind. Mrs.
Hart, who is one of the litiganVs,. was,
according to the statements of the wit
ness, on the best of terms with Miss
Clark and frequently visited her, al
though he always discouVaged such
visits as they seemed productive of no
good.
The case will be resumed at ll.o'clocl
this morning, when the direct examina
tion of Mr. Hart will.be concluded.
The first of the preparatory reviews
to get the troops in shape for the grand
review that is to be held in honor of
Secretary of War Taft will take place
to-morrow, at 10 a. m. on the golf links
at the Presidio. Of course the move
ments of the secretary are uncertain.
However, preparations are being car
ried on with the presumption that he
will stay over at least a day In San
Francisco to get a view of the post and
its environments. The Korea, on which
he is a passenger, is due here on Jan
uary 23. He will only, receive the con
firmation of his appointment when he
arrives at Honolulu; about the l?th
inst., and from that place will undoubt
edly cable to General MacArthur what
his desires and intentions are. Natur
ally San Francisco is very desirous to
have the new secretary partake of her
hospitality and great inducements are
being held out to have him remain for
at least two days. The banquet which
is. being planned by the citizens is in
tended to be a notable affair.
At army headquarters there seems
to be an impression prevailing that the
secretary will rush through the city
and make the fastest time possible to
Washington. General MacArthur has
been, ordered to proceed outside the
heads on' the Slocum and there receive,
the secretary and bring him with all
possible dispatch to the city.
THE GRAND REVIEW.
The grand review as planned now
will include the Tenth Infantry, Colonel
Charles H. Noble; Thirteenth Infantry,
Colonel Alfred C. Markley; Third
Squadron, Ninth Cavalry, Major John
Bigelow Jr.; Twenty-eighth Infantry,
Colonel'Owen J. Sweet, and the Artil
lery Corps, Colonel Charles Morris.
Altogether the review as planned will
be an imposing affair and as thorough
and complete as the review held on the
links when President . Roosevelt was
here.
UnclefSam may not be preparing for
war, but there is one thing certainâ he
is keeping the army transport service
officials here in a lively state of action.
The Meade,. which went on the "dry
dock Monday, comes off at dawn to
day. The transport Warren," which has
been lying up here for the last year, is
scheduled to take her place on the dock
and like the Meade is to be put into
commission at the earliest possible mo
ment. This will put every transport in
these waters into seagoing condition.
The Sherman, Buford and Crook are
now ready to sail at a moment's notice.
These three, with the addition of the
Meade and Warren, will be able to
transport at least five regiments if
trouble brews in foreign waters.
ARMY "HAS1- TESTED.
The army "hash" has been receiving
a three-days' trial by the enlisted men
of the Tenth Infantry. This trial end
ed last night. Colonel Noble stated
that the test was satisfactory. This
hash is not intended to take the place
of the .army rations as prescribed at
present, but is intended to be used in
conjunction with .bacon and â¢ beans,
which have formed the principal arti
cles, of diet in campaigning.
The Twenty-eighth Infantry, which
is returning from Manila, is due to ar-
N. H. Foster, manager's assistant of
the Pacific system of the Southern Pa
cific Company, is to retire shortly from
the corporation with which he has been
connected for nearly twenty-five years.
Yesterday Mr. Foster handed in his
resignation to General Manager Krutt
schnitt, with the request that it be ef
fective by January 20, by which time
Manager Agler will have returned
from an inspection tour of the com
pany's southern branches.
The resignation of Mr. Fester came
as v a surprise to the majority of the
employes of the company, who did not
learn of it until late in the afternoon,
and !iis departure caused no small
amount of regret among those who had
been pleasantly associated with him in
a-business way for many years.
Following the filing of his resignation
it was announced by Mr. Foster that
he had accepted the appointment of
purchasing agent of the San Pedro,
Los Angeles and Salt Lake Railroad,
conferred on him by J. Ross Clark, vice
president of that line. The po
sition was offered him several
weeks ago, but he asked time to
give it consideration. His headquarters
will be in Los Angeles, for which place
he expects to leave as soon as he is
formally relieved of his duties with
the Southern Pacific Company. He goes
to his new post with an advanced sal
ary and a broader field of operations.
Mr. Foster is one of the few remain
ing old guard of the Central Pacific
Company, with which he began work
ing more than twenty-four, years ago
as clerk to the master mechanic of the
road at Winnemucca. Ke was later
made chief clerk of the Sacramento
shops, and his next promotion was to
the position of chief clerk of the mo
tive power department, and later he be
came the auditor of the same office.
Ten years ago, about the time that the
Southern Pacific offices were moved
from Fourth and Townsend streets to
their present location, he was trans
ferred to the office of the manager of
the Pacific system and given the title
of "manager's assistant." In this posi
tion, he has continuously served the
company and has earned for himself
the friendship of every one with whom
he hae come in contact either in a bus
iness or a social way. His successor
has not yet been decided upon by Gen
eral Manager Kruttschnitt. According
to the statement of one of the promi
nent officials of the road yesterday Mr.
Kruttschnitt is undecided as to wheth
er the position will be filled or abol
ishec!.
