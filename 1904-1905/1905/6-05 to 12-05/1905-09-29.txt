TWO LEADING PARTIES JOIN HANDS TO DRIVE CORRUPTION FROM SAN FRANCISCO
Enter Enthusiastically, With Upright Men on Fusion, Ticket, Upon Baffle City of Graft
Complete coalition of the Republican and iDemocratic politicaLorganizations'in the great "conflict to redeem San Francisco from
graft and misrule was accomplished last night. In the patriotic cauise^
John S. Partridge for Mayor, is presented to the electors of and hopes
for the welfare and prosperity of the city of San Francisco w^
PARTRIDGE URGES ALL VOTERS TO
JOIN FOR CIVIC HONESTY.
Makes a Strong and Stirring
Speech Against Debauchery
of Office.. ''
EXCERPTS FROM JOHN S. PARTRIDGE'S SPEECH-
Vur enemies are driven back into their last stronghold, and with
the, black flag at the staff they arc fighting the tight of the Chi
nese, zvith empty shouts and the beating of tomtom's. '\u25a0')
graft is as contagions as leprosy, and ,a thousand times : more
fatal, because it destroys the soul as well as the body.' .
The great majority of the people of San Francisco arc honest in
their desire for better things. Partisanship is forgotten as if there
were a hostile fleet outside the Golden Gate.
/ would like to meet every ygung man -'who is tempted to graft
and say to him h e had better strike his right hand off than stretch
it forth to receive the wages of corruption. Easy money makes
i liard bed. .
"', After Mr. Partridge had received the
nomination of < UeJDcmoccatie^ convent! ou
and* when the cheering had subsided, he
tpoke as follows:
"Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen of the
Convention: In ail modesty, and with no
personal reference, I think you deserve
well of the people of San Francisco, be
cause you have shown that you can put
patriotism above partisanship and sink
personal politics in the public weal.
Nothing but success can come from such
unselfishness. We have beaten the
troops of corruption at every turn. They
boasted, first, that they would win the
primaries', but the people turned out and
overwhelmed them. Then they cried that
they would capture enough of our men
to control the Republican convention.
Again "they lost. Foul creatures 'in
Â« hose hand is mischief, and their right
hund full of bribes.' sought in vain to
seduce our delegates.
"Standing like the stalwarts they are,
in spite of threats and offers of every
kind, in. spite of the most brutal assaults
ever attempted in any gathering of free
American citizens, our men held their
ground: and thtn turned upon our foes,
and b^at them back. Again they shouted
loudly that they would prevent fusion.
But fusion, to-night is an accomplished
fact.
"Even last week they were all smiles
and hope: to-day, their brows are dark
with gloom and despair. Their most de
vrned followers are asking strange ques
tions. 'What docs it mean?' they ask.
'We * were told that we would win the
primaries: then that we vould organize
the convention; then that there would be
rib fusion. If our masters were wrong
in all these things, isn't their confidence
in the outcome of the election mere idle
fcoasting now?'
Doubt Makes Cowards.
"That dcubt is driving the blood from
their cheeks! is making them fearful even
of one another. There \u25a0is confusion in
their councils," and vacillation in every
move of their shifting policy. They are
driven back into their last stronghold,
and, with the black flag at the staff,
they are fighting the fight of the Chinese
with tmpty shouts and the beating of
tomtoms. We want that flag and we
are going after it hard. We want to tear
It down and put up in its place the ban
ner of honesty and a square deal. And in
the last assault I want to be up in the
front, where the blows are thickest. You
have given me the opportunity and for
that accept my thanks. This isn't going
to be any pleasure excursion, and if there
are any faint hearts among us, or dainty
nostrils that are offended by the smell
of powder, they had better not .enlist.
We uon'i want a gun-shy man on the
nrinr line.
"Gentlemen of the convention, I am out
of politics. Two weeks ago. when the
Rcpubi.^an caucus named me as their
choice for Mayor. I abandoned politics
and entered upon this light for decency
and clean government. I believed then,
and ' assert now, that the great majority
of the people of San*-.' rancisco are hon
est in their desire for better things. , and'
are sternly resolved that better condl-'
lions shall prevail. Partisanship is for
gotten as if there were a hostile fleet
outside the Golden Gate.
People Demand Purity.
"The whole people seem to have organ
ized themselves into a gigantic committee
of safety. At such a time how cheap
the desire for political prefer
ment. How trivial are men's opinions
even on matters of great national, con
cern in comparison with the city's honor
and fair, fame. 'Yet, the; foul disgrace of
it. the loss of business through the loss
of civic reputation - and '. maladministra
tion of : our ' public affairs, are I the â¢ very
least of the eviL Graft is as contagious
as leprosy and . a thousand times 'more
fatal, because it ; destroys the ' soul as
well as ' the . body. - I would like to' meet
every young man who is tempted to graft
and say. to him. that he' had better strike
his right hand. off than stretch it forth
to receive the wages of corruption; that

that one dollar honestly earned brings
The San Francisco Call.
more real happiness than a fortune
founded on. bribery, or extortion.
"Gentlemen, this is a clean-cut fight.
There is no issue but graft and anti-
graft. I have been a Republican all my
life, yet 1 stand before you to-night as
the proud nominee of a Democratic
convention. I indorse your platform
because it stands for common honesty
against corruption. I deserve nothing
from you or from the people of San
Francisco, unless you believe that I
am going to bend all the energies of
my soul tt> the task of regenerating
our municipal government.
Honesty His Only Creed. V
"1 ask no man's support, except' upon
the broad ground of civic and political
righteousness. If any man wants a
government where favors are bought
and sold,' l give him fair warning to
vote against me. "I am going totry
the experiment of making a campaign
with no promises except to the people,
so that if I am elected, I can be Mayor
of the whole people, so that I can be
not only Mayor, but the, Mayor's attor
ney, and .the Mayor's manager and -the
Mayor's closest' and most confidential
adviser. When I appeared before' the
Republican convention, I enumerated
certain things which -it seemed to: me
the people had, a right, to demand. One
of the pledges I made pertained to that
portion of . the charter which declares
for, the acquisition of public utilities.
As a practical question, at 1 the present
time, that means the construction . of
the Geary-street Railroad and a munic
ipal water supply. The former has
passed beyond the domain of specula
tion or debate, and should be vigorous
ly hurried to completion, 1 in accordance
with the excellent plans of Engineer
Stut. It will not only be a good thing
in itself, but it; will teach us the' busi
ness of municipal ownership, and 'show
the people of Glasgow ' that" out ? here
; in' the West, we are as: capable of hand
ling that business as themselves..
For Public Water
- "So far as the water question is con
cerned. City Attorney Long has been
engaged for. nearly twVyears in shap
ing plans for the acquisition of \ Lake
Eleanor ; and the Hetch ' Hctchy Valley,
and, I do 'assure you; he has. no: inten
tion" of stopping, now. It has beenjmy
privilege" to assist him" In ; that. : worK,
and ;:T. do unequivocally "declare "that" I
consider *a municipal \u25a0. water/ supply one
of ' our ' most^ Immediate ; necessities,* 1 , and
that I \u25a0 will 7 dor my best* to 'â¢make it -a

DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION NOMINATES JOHN S. PARTRIDGE FOR MAYOR
WITH TREMENDOUS OUTBURST OF APPROVAL OF HIS CANDIDACY.
Fusion Ticket Is Completed and
Campaign Opens With All
Confident of Success.
FIGHT FOR HONESTY IS ON
Patriotism and determination to wage
successful battle against the forces of
corruption marked the proceedings of
the Democratic Convention at Lyric
Hall. The adjournment was preceded
by a remarkable demonstration, unpre-'
eedented Jn the political history of San
FTHnciseo. Stirred by the 'words' of
John S. Partridge, Chairman Thomas
W. nickey and Daniel A. Ryan, chair
man of the Republican Convention, the
delegates on the floor and the spectators
in the gallery sent up a mighty shout
of approval for the men that will lead
the campaign for common honesty. The
clpsing words of Chairman Hickey tell_
of the splendid campaign 'that Is to
come. He said:
Tbe Â«nd of cur deliberations is at .hand. , Go
lottjj with strong beartti. lor victory will be ours.
Thifc-'in largo mens-ure will l>e a young man's
cair.jiaipn *?id lo all of ttiose that will oppose
tit 1 u:ll say now tbat we wiU exercise the
constitutional lisht of iree. speech to the
funhett, limit. Wo will tpeak on tlie street
coiners nnd on the by-<iays, and wÂ« will not
be sllmccd." Thi6 is our city, and to save uer
trom the spciismen we \rl;i battle with all our
oijrfct. The Dem<Â»eratic and ReputJican par-.
lies ha\c In this campaign forgotten what have
b*Â«n their <Jiti*renceÂ» -.n the past, and 10-r.lght
the feooJ ntws will spread tnroushout the city
that tfce two grand old i>a.rUes have girded
en their earner to go torÂ»h and at any cost
tavt tbo city from its debauchers.
With three cheers for t!re ticket and
then three Units three cheers the con
vention iidjourned when Hickey con
cluded.
Monotony, however, held the platform
at Lyric .Hall, where the Democrats
convened, until long after 10 o'clock.
Though it had been announced that the
bcarbort wing would rrot take up the
work of completing the fusion ticket
until after the adjournment of the Re
publican Convention, many of the dele
gates preferred to remain in~the hall
and speculate on the campaign rather
than to witness the turmoil at the Al
nambra. The most interesting subject
of discussion 'was the news that- during
the hours of the afternoon the confer
ence committee of the Democratic Con
vention had struggled hard to fore* the

finer specimen of American manhood. No
roan, because of Mr.- Partridge's character,
splendid nccomplishments and achievements,
could be ' mdre acceptable to"* the Democratic
party. I wish to say that I firmly believe in
the coalition of the Republican* and Demo

way by which the city can be wrested from
the --hands of the freebooters who- owe alle

lawful than "those followed by th< pirates that

We who have fought for years for good

IS AUSPICIOUSLY OPENED.
ARCHBISHOP DISCUSSES LIFE OF FARMER
The opening of the Youths' Directory
Festival in the art gallery of the Me
chanics' Pavilion last night for the \
benefit of the Rutherford farm school
was an event which attracted a large
attendance. The booths, a full list of
which' has already appeared in The
Call, presented a beautiful scene, their
arrangement being artistic in every
i egard.
Archbishop Montgomery attended
and in his address said:
First -irid above all I want to thank the
pres6 of San Francisco Jor the encouragement
li has given to the Youths' Directory and iv
purpose* almost from its foundation to the
prrfe^nt.
We pride ourselves en being: a practical age,
ar.d though we may sometimes exaggerate out
achievements In the matter, there la certainly
r.o -exaggeration :n saying that the Youths'
\u25a0Directory is oce of tiie zziott practical works
in the State jnd this, we think, ,1b the reason
wttf it baa appealed to both press and public. I
- There. 1* "a<aÂ» ttmÂ« it* time -heard . the cry;
â¬f "back to the land." and Father Crowley \u25a0
ts trylnr. at least on a mod>9t scale to i
realize that Idea. ' / . \u25a0
The -tr^nd of the population is constantly
tovard tho cities. This seems to be by some
â¢ort of natural tendency If not by a natural
law. so I suppose, there is scarcely any use
o? moralizing on the comparative merits of tht.
city and the country. 5
If I were to speak a word that could in-Â»*
fluenc*. the political economist or the powers
that shape the laws aftd Influence great move
nir-Bts I would say that the reason why we
see the trend toward the cities !s that in
the ordinary coarse of things the farmer Is
the poorest paid of any worker, though his
lsbor is the harden, his hoars the longest,
with the least diversion in his laborious life.
During the evening Miss: Julia Sul
livan and Denis O'Sullivan delighted
the assemblage with vocal numbers, ac
companied by Fred llauer. James R.
Kelly presided at the entertainment.
The festival is to continue for two
weeks and each evening there will be

CLEVER FORGER
STEALS FORTUNE
NEW YORK, Sept. 28.â The details of
a scheme whereby the National City
Bank was recently victimized by a clever
forger came out to-day. The forger pre
sented a bogus check bearing the name"
of a well-known stock exchange llrm
and received In return securities valued
at $360,000.
Pearl & Co., stock brokers at 27 Wil
liam street, recently negotiated a one
day loan for $300,000 with the bank. On
Wednesday a check for the amount of
the loan, plus $37 60 for the one day's
interest, was presented at tne bank by
a stranger, who received the securities
deposited by. Pearl & Co. for their loan.
The bank on which the brokers' check
was drawn is one 'with which Pearl &
Co. never han an account, so the
forgery was not discovered until the
check had passed through the clearing
house Exchange, when it was promptly
branded as . fictitious. A private detec
tive agency was called in and transfer

HOAN'S KIDNEY
U\JJt\lHO PILLS
lyier
The Real Cause of Backache, Urinary Ills, Dizzy Spells,
Etc., is Weakness of the Kidneys. DoanV
Kidney Pills Cure Weak Kidneys.
' ' Bick kidneys, like any weak link in a
chain, weaken the whole structure of
the body and hasten its final breaking
down.
Overwork, strains, colds and -other
causes injure the kidneys, and when
the activity of the kidneys is lessened
the whole toody suffers from an excess
of -uric acid circulated with the blood.
Backache, rheumatic pains, urinary
ills and languid or nervous spells fol-
low, and there' Is an ever-increasing
tendency toward fatal diabetes or
Brlght's Disease. There is no real help
for the sufferer at any time except kid-
ney help.
Doan's Kidney Pills is the one kidney,
specific that acts directly, upon the kid-
neys.- makes lasting: cures, and Is in-
dorsed by people you know. It is pure-
ly vegetable and contains no dangrerous
drugs. It relieves inflammation and
f ongestion, restores . healthy .kidney,
tissue, and rjJt the. sufferer permanent-
ly- of -those, aches' and pains that come
from sick kidneys.

Colonel T. H; Hanbury -and Captain -Wil

such ~. a' construction would ' seriously im
pede the. traffic of the small 'fleet of, river
boats .'which carry -the - products Tof . the
interior to 'thÂ«' markets on^ the sea; ' ".This
decision means that : if : the : Southern
Pacific Company .'desires .to . shorten the
ruhnlng. time of ' Its'. 'train's by abolishing
thej ponderous ferry 'at.. Port : Costa, "It
must do ' so .by. the{ erection vof abr idge

â¢ -It now seems',* likely .that if '"a ' bridge

The objection of i the Southern Pacific
to this high-bridge is. that the expense
would be tremendous, necessitating , the
construction of- a. Jong .grade " and^ the
tearing out and rebuilding of the' tracks.

of representatives -of the invested inter

the-erectiou: of -a-pile. bridge ..across the
straits were -plainly pointed out; to him.
At the end of the journey he eaid: ;
The river- traffic -1b- very important and I
realize the. necessity of its protection. It must
not be'endangrered merely to save money for;a
laJlroad company. ' On the other hand, a bridge
Is necessary for the railway aÂ« a convenience

WHOSE N AMES GUARANTEE HONESTY OF PURPOSE
Anti-Ruef Ticket Is Made Up
: of Opponents of Graft.
IS CERTAIN OF SUCCESS
Fall of i the Gangsters' Regime
Is Assured by Union.
The work of fusion has been completed. The result has
been the selection of a ticket that will end the regime of
shameless graft once and forever in San Francisco. Every
man on the ticket has a record that not only entitles him to
the vote of every honest citizen, but demands that every one
â¢who has the municipality's interests at heart should vote for
him. From the candidate for Mayor down they are the best
men for the places for which they have been selected. San
Franciscans of both of the great national parties areljustified
in taking a pride in these nominees.
JOHN S. PARTRIDGE
IS A SELF-MADE MAN
Candidate for Mayor Has a Rec
ord That Should Win Re
spect of Honest People.
John S. Partridge, the Fusion candidate
for Mayor, is. above all. a self-made
man. The story of his life Is a record
of determination, perseverance and In
tegrity. Thrown against adversity from
childhood, he proved himself master of
circumstances that would discourage any
ordinary epirit.
He was born in Susan vtllÂ©, Lessen
County, on June 22, IS7O. His father .was
John C Partridge, a well-known civil en
gineer. Until he was IS years of age
yocrg Partridee attended the country
school at Susanville, and then he came
to San Francisco, where he became a
pupil at the Boys* High School. There
he proved himself an earnest student. By
close application and diligence he man
aged to complete the three years* course
In two years, graduating with high
honors. . .
Yocng Partridge was unnble to enter
the university Immediately because of
slender means, so he returned to Susan
ville, where he conducted the Lassen
County Advocate for a year and raised
the necessary funds to complete his edu
cation. He returned to this city, where
he lived with his mother and sisters and
bpgan his course at the State University.
"While there he earned his living by con
tributing to San Francisco weeklies and
Eastern magazines, and made something
of a name for himself in literature, but
he decided to abandon letters for the law.
After graduating from the university
be became an Instructor at the Cogswell
Polytechnic College, and. later at the
Lowell High School. "While engaged in
this work the undefatigable young man
took a post-sraduate course at the uni
versity and became a master of. arts. * .'
Ail this time Partridge was hard at
wcrk studying law. and was admitted to
the tar in 1537. As soon as he was made
as attorney he began to practice and
quickly made a name for himself. City
Attorney Percy V. Long appointed him
his first assistant two years ago because
cf his recognized ability. Partridge was
selected to fight the city's case against
the Spring Valley Water Works. His
record in this case is the best proof of
his knowledge of the law. The suit is
stJll pending, but it is written that Part
ridge is the only attorney who ever
worried the corporation.
Mr. Partridee has been a resident of
th<Â» Mission for more than fifteen years,
and is well known in that section of the
city. He .lives with his mother. Mrs.
EL E. Partridge, at 1125 Guerrero street.

NEWS OF THE COUNTIES ABOUT THE BAY
POLICEMAN SLAYS THUG
IN THE EARLY MORNING
Officer .Lestrange Is
Attacked by.
Robbers.
Kills One and Es
capes Bullets
of Others.
Cracksman s 1 ools
Found on the
Dead Man.
BERKELEY. SÂ«pt. 2S. â Facing four
desperate thugs, who sought to murder
a. man they evidently believed might
interfere with their criminal plans. Po
lice-man John" J. Lestrange gave battle
lor his life 'in West Berkeley early thib
morning, and in an exchange of shots
sect a. bullet straight to the heart of
the gang's ringleader, killing him al
most Instantly. Lestrange escaped
without a sefiitcii, reversing thereby a
common happening around, the bay,
whereby policemen are killed Jind
c'rotiks escape.
Four shots were fired at the police
nuui in the battle of bullets, from which
he came out unscathed. He stumbled
aad fell in the excitement of the con
flict and was precipitated into a ditch at
the edge of the sidewalk. This accident
may have saved his life, for the desper
adoes with whom he fought believed
when he fell that they had killed their
taasL
One yelled in triumph as he fled: "I
ifot the 1 ." Lestrange lay
for a few seconds in the ditch, and
when be arose the murderous thugs had
rled. They left behind their dead com
rade, - He lay with face upturned on the
tidcwiilk.
The man 'who was laid low by Le
btrange's shot has been inspected to
day by hundreds of curious persons at
the Berkeley Morgue, but none has
identified him. His appearance indicates
refinement, but the equipment found on
bis person showed conclusively his des
perate character.
< No doubt exists in the minus of the
officers that Policeman Lestrange. in
killing the man, foiled the plans of a
taiip of crooks who contemplated car
rying out one or more extensive safe
cracking jobs during the night.
TOOLS OK HIS TRADE.
The dead man carried a revolver,
â¢even Morse drills, a chisel, a * black
mask, punches and skeleton keys. If
the ringleader carried ao extensive an
equipment for safe-cracking work, his
Confederates, the officers say, doubtless
were loaded down with other t ools.
"Lestrange encountered the four men
at -University and San Pablo avenues at
ab_mu 1:30 o'clock this morning. They
inquired of him the time when the last
car would go to the county line. He
acswrred the" question and the quartet
jnoved away. Lestrange remained at
the corner, watching 1 the strangers. All
â¢wore overcoats. They were grown men.
"of ordinary appearance. The ringleader
or spokesmen was clean shaven, well
set and soft spoken. He walked a few
feet ia advance of his companions as
they started to return to Lestrange, the
g^ag apparently suspecting that the
latter, whom they may or 'may. not have
known .was* an officer, might interfere
with tlfeir work, and would be better
muzzled, or dead.
When wit hi v ten feet of the. police
man the â¢ leader suddenly drew his revol
ver and 'shouted: "Hold up your hands,
you \u25a0 â â , -if you don't want
your head blewn off!" -.'
Lestrange had his gun- cocked and
ready r for, action in hie overcoat pocket.
He instantly drew the weapon, and be
fore the thug- facing him* could carry
out his threat the officer fired. The bul
let went straight to the heart. The
criminal staggered and fell dead. Then
his companions opened fire on Le
strange. Two bullets whizzed by him
and then Lestrange stumbled Into the
ditch while making 1 for the open road
way. Two more bullets came in his di
rection, and he lay prone, while the
thugs, believing they had killed their
man. fled in the night down San Pablo
avenue, turning on Bristol street. No
trace of them has been" found.
CROOK OK HIGH DEGREE.
The dead man was about 32 years old,

Pain in the
Mead
Is a danger signal, warning
you that ' the brain nerves are -
exhausted â irritated, and are
undergoing an unnatural strain.
Frequent and prolonged at-
tacks of .pain weaken the gen-
erative power of the nerve
cells of the brain, and lead to
Joss of memory, melancholy,
spasms, epilepsy, and frequent-
ly insanity.
When the brain nerves are
weakened they are unable to
supply sufficient nerve force
to the nerves that control the
lungs, . heart, - stomach and
other organs, and these organs
are thus robbed of energy, and
unable to meet the demands
upon them,and they get sick.

OAKLAND. Sept. 2S.â Mrs. Mary G.
Rossler. who ten years ago. as Miss
May Pope, was on^of the leaders of
society on this eide o. the bay and whose
marrlaee to Charles A. Rossier was the
biggest event of Its kind ever held in
Oakland, began divorce proceedings
against him to-day on the ground of-ex
treme cruelty., charging - that he has
abused her, calling hpr "vile names both
alone and In the presence of her Darents
and children. He is in the insurance
business and she asks for $100 a month
alimony and the custody of their tvo
ch.Jdieii, a boy and a girl.

weighed about 150 pounds, and was at
tired in a black slouch hat, black coat,
striped vest, striped trousers, blue tie
and canvas shoes with rubber heels.
Nearly all Of his front teeth were filled
with gold. His hands were soft, per
fectly manicured and his hair carefully
brushed, all of the details seeming, to
indicate that he was not of the common
criminal type. >
On his person, besides the drills, keys,
chisel, mask, revolver and punches, was
a coil of rope about five feet long,
which was identified to-day by J. Galan,
a winery proprietor, at Ninth and Uni
versity ..avenues as belonging to him.
Galan reported to the police to-day that
he found his horse harnessed in the sta
ble when he arose this morning, and
that' some person or persons had evi
dently tried to steal âthe. animal,, but
could not harness the beast because of
its bad temper^ 'The thief, who attempt
ed this horse stealing job took rope
from the stable, and the stolen rope was
found on. the body of the dead crock.
It Is supposed that the gang:. In plan
ning the night's work, figured on the
necessity cf a quick "get-away," and
purposed stealing a horse and buggy to
use later in the night in making their
escape.

have had any considerable sum in its

MRS. ADA HENT
FOUND INSANE
OAKLAND, Sept. 28.â After an intensely
dramatic Mrs. Ada B. Hent,
mother of Mrs. j Corinne Barry Bulkley,
whose marriage to the former yell, leader
of the University, of California and his
desertion o^ her after the birth of their
child was a sensation of the university
town, was committed to Â»the Napa Insane
Asylum this: morning.
Charges and counter . charges passed
between insane woman and her
daughters ; during the hearing, lending a
bitterness; to- it that was a sad climax
to the misfortune of Corinne. "
A quarter, of a century ago Mrs. Hent,
then Barry, knew the McAllisters,
Tevises and other people then prominent
in San Francisco society. Her daughters
married well and are j prominent among
people of ' worth. Mrs." Ada"; B. Newell,
her eldest daughter,:. is the wife of Mar
shall^-A. 'Newell, high up in insurance
circles In San' Francisco: another, daugh
ter is" Mrs. Minerva B. Dickson; a third
is Mrs. Husband of London, England; a
son jia William Barry; a Honolulu con
tractor, and' her youngest' child is Mrs.
Bulkley.' who 'five; months ago was the
principal figure in a sensational affair
that threw \u25a0 the university town into a
furor. V.
ACCUSES THE DOCTOR.
The initiative in the matter of having
Mrs. Hent sent to the asylum' was taken
by ;Dr. J." W. Stitt of ; Berkeley, who
stated \u25a0 that he had done so for the . pro
tection of the good name of his own
family. The \u25a0 children '* of Mrp. He'iit
simply v told ,wh'at^they," Rnew.of terrible
tirades on the part; of. their mother that
have kept them in. terror since they were
children.. It, however, \u25a0 needed no* testi
mony on their part to convict the mother
of Insanity^ for her own talk, \u25a0< once she
started, was conclusive that age and re
cent trouble had only made her vagaries
more 'pronounced. ",
"Dr. '... Stitt stated that he had attended
Mrs. Bulkley , and that her., mother, was
spreading -scandalous s stories about' his
attendance and had' threatened to kill
him.',- â¢/ .v'-''- ; \u25a0â¢â¢,â¢:,.\u25a0 .'\u25a0\u25a0 "â¢â¢-'\u25a0\u25a0 :..-.;" .\u25a0-â¢'.-':
â¢ .Mrs. Newell read, letters received from
her mother ,in which t Mrs. \ Hent made
charges of .immoral conduct on the part
of her entire family. She accused her
son, William Barry, \of being connected
with the Bessie Bailey affair at Agnews
Asylum and said' he also <knew why Amy
Murphy had . been put out of j the way in
San Francisco,; and stated 'that she had
not committed suicide, as had been re
ported, but had; been killed..
MR9./BU I.KLBY DEJECTED.
When Mrs. Corinne Bulkley was called
upon to take the; stand she was hardly
able to talk. The gaze of the throng and
her own "emotions -almost caused & col
lapse, but she pulled herself together with
an effort and , toM what she knew of
her mother's acts.' She 3poke of her with
much .tenderness, stating that in her
trouble;she- had been * kind to her. \ On
theother hand she said that only a short
timerago her mother broke a piece of
crocked over, her- head and told, her
that she had negro blood in her because
her head was so haad. ; She stated that
her mother at times would go % Into a
china closet and break: every dish in it.
She had-" created scenes! about the Newell
home in" San : Francisco until warrant
had to be got out to keep her. quiet under
threat" of arrest \u25a0
'The case was heard before Judge Ogden
In the probate department of the Superior
Court ; and occupied' an entire morning
and â¢' attracted unusual : attention. When
Judge Ogden- told Mrs. Hent of â¢ his de
cision she exclaimed; "God have mercy
on I their; souls." She then declared that
she was, not insane anU demanded a trial
by jury," which it is possible' may have
to be allowed her. , ' . , '

EXPELLED FROM
THE DORMITORY
Forty Students at Stanford
Ordered -to Leave Encina
Hair as Eesult of Hazing
MUST LIVE ELSEWHERE
Nightly Disturbances Cause
the Faculty to Discipline
Many Prominent Collegians
- STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Sept. 28.â
Forty Stanford students, residing: in , th^
men's dormitory, Encina Hall, were to
day ordered to give up their: rooms and
find living accommodations elsewhere.
This order was made by the faculty com
mittee, on student affairs of which P*o
fessorÃ. L. Green of the department of
mathematics is chairman. The order af
fects the most. prominent men in college,
including -B. A. | Cunha, the president of
; the student body, and members of the
athletic teams.-
Ever since college-opened this year
there has been more or less disturbance
in the dormitory every evening as a re
sult of the action taken by the faculty
to prevent* the hazing of freshmen. The
older /men in the hall have been -the lead
ers in the disturbances and it was to
weed out the cause of the nightly
"rough-houses'.' that the forty men have
i been removed. â¢\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0..' â '\u25a0\u25a0-\u25a0â¢
The action. of the : faculty Is. without
precedent. The sympathy, of the student
body seems to be with the students who
have _ been deprived of the dormitory
privileges, especially since several of the
men removed are said to have been guilty
of . no breach of dormitory rules and to
have been refused an audience before the
faculty committee.
Professor Green, who issued, the order
to the students, told them that ' the dis
turbances had caused complaints and that
some one had to be. removed.'
The . faculty took no notice of the dis
turbances In the hall until a score of
students . locked the night watchman in
his room and then buried him under/chairs
thrown through the transom. Palo Alto
is flooded with students who are looking
tor new accommodations.
. Some of the more prominent students
who have been ordered from the dormi
tory are: F. H. Abbott, J. Rellly, the
tennis player; B. Nordman, the baseball
catcher; R. F. Myers," a tennis crack;
F. G. Mugler, E. A. -Cunha, president of
the student body;Â«^. F. Laumelster,

REDWOOD CITY. Sept. 23.â Tha pebpte
of this city are . celebrating one of tha
most important and significant improve
ments ever undertaken in the history ot
the town. The streets throughout tha
business section are now .-well and per
manently paved with asphalt and* com
pare favorably with any others . ta tha
State. The problem of proper pavement*
has long been a perplexing one for tha
City Council. Tear after year expensive
experiments were made, but to no pur
pose. Various kinds of rock were used,
but they proved useless aa a. city -pave
ment. Conditions were drifting from bad
to worse and tile complaints of. the mer
chants were added to those of the travel
ing public. , . . â¢\u25a0-. s :\u25a0.\u25a0\u25a0â¢\u25a0'.
Nothing apparently, however, could bÂ«
done. The city was heavily bonded, for
sewers, new grammar schools and a high
school. The tax rate was high and the
city authorities hesitated to make it
higher. Drastic 'measures were s.een to
be inevitable, however, and at the last
election a bond issue of $100,000 was voted.
Of this sum $35,000 was voted for water
mains and $65,000 for the j>avinjr ; of the
streets. This money has "now been ex
pended, the improvements are practically
made and the people of the city" are con
gratulating themselves.

received" serious Injuries to her spine, a
broken arm and a severe shock to hÂ«r

With another lady and a young: slrl the
injured woman was climbing along \u25a0 the
side of the hill near the soda spring.
The loose earth under her gave way and
she fell. Midway between her starting
point and the creek- is a path, and the
woman rolled on this, thus ' breaking her
fall. Had It not been for the path she
would' have been instantly killed. As It
is it is feared the Injuries to her spine
may prove fatal-
Workmen at â¢ the â¢ park : were attracted
by 'the cries of the women, and they
rushed to the point and picked .up the
unconscious body. She was carried down
to the bath house. She soon regained
consciousness, but was. unable to walk.
The .injured woman and her friends
were brought to this city on an electric
car and were met at the corner of Sec

took them to the depot. They left on
the 2:40 train for San Francisco.
To every one who asked them the

ACCORD SIGNED
Gr^at Satisfaction Caused
. by the Amicable Settlement
of the Moroccan Dispute
COMPKOMISE MEASURE
Suspense of Months, Which
Threatened the Peace of
Europe, Is Now Terminated
PARIS. Sept. 28.â The Franco-German
accord upon Morocco signed to-day by
Premier Rouvter and Prince Radolln
arouses the keenest satisfaction not only
on account of Morocco, but chiefly be
cause It terminates the suspense of
months which threatened to disturb the
peace of Europe. Both the Foreign Of
fice and the German Embassy were
equally gratified to close ttie controversy.
The final formalities brought out an ex
change of cordial felicitations between
Premier Rouvier and Embassador Radolin
and the plenipotentiaries. Dr. Rosen and
M. Revoll. The accord Is interpreted as
a compromise in which each side secures
concessions. Chancellor yon Bulow*s
proposition to submit Moroccan questions
to a conference is finally realized, and
M. Rouvier has carried his point of keep-
Ing France's special Interests from the
conference and restricting the remaining
Questions within exact limits. The diplo
mats consider the result highly advan
tageous In removing obstacles to a rap
prochement between France and Germany.
Commenting on this view the semi-official
Temps this evening says:
France does not want an alliance outside of
that with Russia, but nbe is cone the less
ready to welcome closer relations with other
nations. Germany's conciliatory attitude and
final concessions for a number of contested
points is attributed to a desire to promote a
better feeling . with France and Russia, thus
counteracting on the continent the advantages
\u25a0which Great Britain gains through her new al
t!ancÂ« with Japan.
' The agreement makes a special reserva
tion of the frontier region between Al
giers and Morocco, where the maintenance
of the policy will be regulated directly
between France and the Sultan without
submission' to the conference. The regu
lation of contraband in the fame region
also remains for France to determine with
the Sultan. '\u25a0''-. -:/::*â¢;
The two governments unite in asking
that Spain accept Algeclras as the place
for the conference. '.V-^'.'M \\^rw i'\u25a0
On the question of -the recent German
loan to Morocco it is agreed: that French
bankers shall participate, vxvithy the -.Â£&?
mans, and there is to fee a similar particiV

Finally the accord provides for thejsub-!

MEXICANS RIOT
AT CELEBRATION
Grossly Insult Americans
and Other Foreigners and
Stove Their Eesidences
APOLOGY IS DEMANDED
United States Consul Will
Take Action in Matter
and Seek Adequate lledress
EL PASO, Tex., Sept. 28.â During the
celebration of a Mexican holiday in
Parral, State of Chihuahua, some Mex
icans grossly insulted the Americans
and other foreigners on the streets and
even stoned the houses of the foreign
residents. The better element of Mex
icans, however, did not participate in
the demonstration. The foreigners held
mass-meetings and put the matter in
the hands of United States Consul* Long,
who is the only foreign Consul in that
city. He will demand an apology.
Parral is in . a rich mining section,
with several hundred foreign residents.
The Mexican police failed to make any
arrests and afterward explained that
their force was insufficient-find that it
would have precipitated'a riot had they
attempted to make any arrests.

Bonuses Paid to^Agents of
Company Are MeretyLoans
NEW YORK," Sept" 28.â Several sensa
tional incidents . developed; at ;the session'
of , the legislative committee on life Insur
ance investigation to-day. '; The < first was
when George W: Perkins;* vice \u25a0president
of the New York ; Life Insurance \u25a0' Com
pany and member of the -firm of r-J.r -J. P.
Morgan 1 & Co., objected to producing the
books of his firm showing -i a certain
transaotton of that firm with the New
York : Life. Perkins offered . to ; present
a copy of- the entry In question from the
books, i but Prosecutor Hughes demanded
the books after several refusals on . the
part of Perkins. The books will be pro
duced later.
In the course of his testimony Perkins,
when asked concerning the difference in
the statement of "profits from' securitieÂ«"
in the Massachusetts report of the Y com
mittee and "of no proflta from securities"
in the New. York report, said: "When we
get national supervision we won't '\u25a0â¢.have'
these conflicts betwen-.the; different
States." ". < * t, ' , V; \u25a0". - - ,-,
Perkins, testified to a number of trans
actions In which he represented -Morgan
& Co. as sellers and the New York Life
Insurance Company as ; purchasers.
Another sensation ,was ' sprung later in
theday when Vice President Thomas A*
Bucknerjof the New York Life Insurance
Company detailed' the advances made -to
agents and which were carried In the re
port to the State Superintendent < of In
surance as "computing renewal \u25a0 prem
iums." It was brought out aus a matter
of fact that these advances were, loans,'
but were not carried as such.^ Buckner
testifled that advances were made to
agents sometimes .as inducements |to
leave otHer companies and enter, the em
ploy of the Nevr York Life.
â¢A situation of conflict in Buffalo in 1901
between the Equitable and the New York
Life was brought out. In order , to get
agents of the Equitable away from that
company liberal advances and liberal con
tracts were. made. by the New York Life/
Buckner testifled that, these advanaes to
agents In the Buffalo branch of the New
York Life in 1902 alone exceeded by $48,
000 the amount really earned by these
agents. ; Later Buckner j acknowledged
that this was most extravagant and said
that In 1903 the' amount was cut down by
half, and by half the remaining amount
in 1904. ,
A copy of a contract ana a confidential
letter to David H. Desbecker of Buffalo,
one of the agents in question, showed
the inducements held out for. him to: en
ter* the employ of the New . York i Life.
The confidential letter or supplementary
contract reads as followsi s '\u25a0
(Confidential) ;

FRIDAY .......SEPTEMBER 29, 1905
T-^ARLY in our experiences that began in the Spanish war Ad
r-< mirai Dewey said that the Filipinos were better qualified for
â¢*â^ self-government than the Cubans. But Cuba took on self
government. The administration *of President Palma, contrary to
our expectations, lias been wise and upbuilding. The island is
enjoying a greater prosperity than was ever before known in all the.
history of the West Indies. It is a general and not a partial pros
perity. It is, shared by all of the people. The taxes are paid and
lire" public revenues, honestly managed, have put a surplus of $isr
000,000 in the national treasury.
'Public sanitation, instituted by the United States during our
{tentative ocupancy, has been continued until the island is as health
ful as Massachusetts, and Havana is as safe a city as Boston. The.
devastation left by years of war and revolution has disappeared
and jeft no sigh. Yet some of the Cubans are not happy. Palma
profited by his long novitiate in the United States. He appreciates
ihe value of law, order and peace, as factors in the happiness of the
people. Looked- at from this distance there appears every reason
why his administration, or its methods, should be continued as the
permanent policy of the country. If this be done Cuba promises
to become the richest country in the world. The natural resources
are beyond computation. They easily surrender to human labor
that is not hard, and the markets of the globe are eager for their
converted forms of produce.
The contrast between Cuba, independent and self-governing,
and Porto Rico as ah integral part of the United States, is so great
'as to suggest that the smaller island, also rich in natural resources,
should be relinquished and made independent, 'in the hope that it
. will follow in the footsteps of its neighbor. Yet there are things
Jn the Cuban situation that countervail this view. The old distem
per in the Latin blood is fermenting in Cuba. Palma is a candidate
for re-election to the Presidency. From the standpoint of natural
politics it would seem that assent to this should be as general as
was the indorsement of the election and re-election of Washington
in the first years of our constitutional history. If Cuba desire peace
and prosperity, which are supposed to be the best gifts of govern
ment to any people, another term for Palma seems so natural that
.opposition to it is a hideous mistake.
But there is opposition of the most tempestuous and sinister
character. Perhaps Cuba has too many generals. One of these,
Jose Miguel Gomez, Governor of the Province of Santa Clara, as
pired to the Presidency. The first political move in the campaign,
under .the constitution of the republic, is the choice by ballot of the
election boards. These seem to stand somewhat in the relation
to the. final result that our electoral colleges do to the election of a
President of the .United States. Anyway, their control of the final
result :is such that the candidate for the Presidency who gets a
majority .of- them is sure of election. General Gomez entered the
â¢ campaign, for the selection of these boards, and it soon degenerated
into the usual reckless Spanish-American fight for power, with
the $15,000,000 surplus in the treasury as the prize of victory. There
wÂ«re .Hots, assassinations, slaughter by the police and national
troops, and all of the violent incidents that are familiar, in such
struggles in the Latin-American countries, % where changes in the
executive are effected by revolution.
: . Palma wo.n, carrying all of the election boards. Gomez, seeing
theihopelessness of his fight, relinquishes his candidacy, but does
..it ill characteristic, fashion. Instead of willing acquiescence in the
result* for the good of his country, he withdraws, surly and snarling,
'andVtries to leave behind him the embers of further trouble. In his
, peppery manifesto he- says: "One other road is open, that followed
.by other nations in analogous circumstances, namely, the right of
% re-volution. \u25a0 But . Cuba stands in. a peculiar position, as an armed
conflict/ would inevitably bring foreign intervention. Therefore, I,
\u25a0who had the courage to rebel against Spain, which was one thou
sand times stronger than Palma's Government, decline to accept the
; responsibility of plunging the country into war."
; This is saying to other swashbuckling revolutionaries that
Palma's government is nefarious, and deserves no better than Spain
'did, and any one sufficiently reckless has the right to rebel against
it. It is typical .Latin- American politics. Gomez surrenders not
as .a patriot, with the interests of his country at heart, but to the
superior gpwer of the United States, and does it making faces at
his. ovrn government.
The incident show r s the wisdom of the reservation by this
country of the right to intervene in civil disturbance in the island.
Had that been left in doubt, war would be on now. It is a case of
too niuch prosperity for the uneasy politicians. The treasury sur
plus is a bait to their cupidity. They want to, lay hands on it, and
would" do so but for fear of the United States.
; Palma wilf succeed himself, but the situation bodes no good
r to Jjis second term. The spirit shown by Gomez, if propagated
among- a ' considerable number of the people, will mean ceaseless
agitation of issues for the next Presidential campaign, when he
cannot hope to be a candidate. The crisis will come in the election
of his", successor. If it be Gomez or one inspired by him, popular
institutions in. the island will be subjected to a great strain.
A FRENCH STUDY OF THE UNEMPLOYED.
S~*> ONSUL COVERT of Lyon 'has sent to the Department of
C Commerce and Labor a translation from the French Congres
sional Record, of some of the chief points of a report on the
relief of unemployed workingmen made by Engerand in the name
of a house committee of which he is chairman. - As we occasionally
*in this country have periods of industrial depression in which the
question of, what to-do about the unemployed becomes a very serious
'one to economists and philanthropists, the data of similar; but; niuch
worse conditions in foreign countries and the conclusions drawn
from them by experts may be useful to us, and help us to maintain
our more fortunate. state and prevent our problem of enforced idle
ness'from ever becoming so widespread and chronic as it is. in
Europe..
Engerand confessedly finds the task of trying to solve the'prob
lem of the unemplbyed a very difficult one; and it seems especially;
so in France. In that country the financial" condition is such that
it is practically impossible to. try any new experiments that involve
expense. Some of the*. laws already made on this employment sub
ject cannot be put in operation for lack of funds. The French rate
pf taxation has reached the highest endurable limit. The; second
ejnpire tried the remedy of carrying on great public improvements ;
it is impossible to rqsort to that now.
"Out of the mass of Engerand's investigations and deductions
one feature may be selected as of most value to Caiifornians. It is
also the central interest of his whole paper as an economic study .
He does not believe in* schemes for the relief of the unemployed,
but wishes to plan for. the removal of the cause of- enforced idleness.
He traces the evil back from the city's overcrowding to the lack of
profitable and permanent rural employment; :To secure this per
manent rural employment industrial education is needed. The oc
cupations of tending the land should be complemented by other
industries so distributed that men could live in their rural homes
and they and their families add to their, incomes by thus having
profitable work all the year round.
Two sentences which show how conveniently California might
develop this safeguard -against, poverty andlackVof employment are
these : "Very interesting r efforts" have been made., to; develop work
in the family and to revive home work by making use ; *of; water
power and transporting electric powder. Who can say that we have
not here the initiative .of an economic revolutionâ that electricity
will' not render to the country that life which has been suspended
by machinery concentrating work in and around factories?.'', '

The Supreme Right of Woman
DOROTHY FENIMORE.
WHAT is woman's greatest right?
Why, to be loved. It Is only the
disappointed woman who will
tell you otherwise. It Is this which
gives one sympathy toward women who
have forsaken their natural sphere for
vain ambitions, trading, their birthright
for a mess of pottage.'
No woman sighs for fame or covets"
independence if she enjoys a satisfying
love. . v
It is strange that It is. through; love,
which is in itself so restless, that; a
woman's heart' should lose l its restless
ness, provided she loves happily. She
"settles down" .without complaint, con
tent with quiet duties and simple tasks
if only she can become thereby a help
mate {0 the man she loves. ;,"'
The happiest women, I believe, are
those whose histories are never writ
ten except in the lives of those: about
them and in the recording angel's book.
They' are the ones who have learned
in time that greatness fori.a- woman
consists in loving greatly *â¢ and *' have
been blessed with the strength put
this knowledge which haÂ» come to
them into self -forgetful deeds of love.
The ability* to love greatly is part of
the peculiar genius. of ;the s-sx. It has
been claimed against 'many, men of
genius that they were incapable of lov
ing truly with a self-absorbing pas
sion. This is easily explained If 4my
premise is true that masculine genius
is primarily of the mind, while woman
ly genius is essentially, of the heart.
You will find if " you /-< study the
biographies of ; famous 5 , women , that,
plainly, in the majority .of cases," they
were heart-starved at the time their
natures were unfolding.: that the , fame
which they-won was not merely the dif
ficult fruit of effort, > but "as ;t; t well the
painful product of disappointed dreams.
For Illustration let me .take the ; case
of Margaret-Fuller,, whose ; intellectual
success , was ; and left A its

eloquent than any epigram she ever
wrote or spoke was that cry of her
longing soul, when all those about her
were envying, the shining glory of her
unusual success: VI shall always reign
through the intellect, but this, the life!
My God! shall that never be sweet?" :
When has woman ever, written sadder
words than these: "There comes a cdn
sclousness that I have no real hold on
life, no real permanent connection with
any soul. All life that has : been, or
could be natural; to me, has been de
nied." And where shall we find the in
fluence of love upon a woman's nature
epitomized more' eloquently than in
these words which this talented woman
wrote after love had come to her late
in life and she- had found in mother
hood the perfect joy: "In earlier days I
dreamed of doing and being much,' but
am now content, with the Magdalen,- to
rest my plea hereon, ''she has loved
much.' " . 'V.-;; ! " .

Many Dangers
of Living.
HAS It ever struck you' that every
day in^ your lifeâ be it" ever so
, humdrum â youl_-pass. ; unscathed,
through as many dangers as the sol
dier on the battlefield?
â¢ Take, for instance, the innocent
looking lemonade bottle. The carbonic
acid gas within is compressed to such
anl; extent that afew^extra shakes, la
flawjn the bottle, or an extra warm at
mosphere, would cause It to burst. Uke
a bomb and seriously injure every one
within range, says Pearson's .Weekly.
Most, of us have at times visited the

linder full pf lausrhlne: gus. with an
outward pressure of goodness knows
how, many pounds to the square inch>
If he were to drop that cylinder you
would get the biggest lift In the world
you'd ever, ; experienced; he would
draw no more teeth, and the house
would ba a wreck. .\u25a0â¢; r '\* .-'
Then there is the sportive orange
and frisky banana peel. As you are
dashing across the street under tha
horse's neck, just one. square Inch of
peel unnoticed would be enough to
call .in your Insurance money, and
you'd neve.r know what had hit you.
A ride on the stodgy, lumbering old
omnibus , seems I fafe ; enough, but ro
member that the wheels are only kept
on by linchpins, and the sudden break
ing of one of those useful little things
would probably have the effect of
shooting you off before you knev%
where you were.
Perhaps, however, the greatest temp
tation we offer to providence is; In .the
use of the bicycle. When you think of
the score of little things which may
go wrong with your machine and let
you down badly, it Is surprising that
you -have survived go long.
A weak brake on a steep hill, faulty
brazing of the frame, a weak crown,
a jumping chain, side-slip, and a host
of other possibilities, are always on the
cards. Yet bicycle accidents are re
markably few.
We are wont to place "the most Im
plicit confidence in our chemist when
he makes tin a prescription for us, and
It is lucky for the community at large
that that confidence is not often mis
placed. Yet so many drugs look alike,
smell alike, and are stored in similar
bottles, that it would be the easiest
thing in the world for your dispenser
to give you an elegant rat poison In
mistake for cough mixture or some
thing like that.
While on the subject of chemists we
naturally think of diseases. Microbes
of all kinds of diseases are continually
floating around on the atmosphere: we
breathe millions of them, billions of
them can roost on the tip of your nose,
and they are on your food thicker than'
pepper shaken from the pepper-box.

Your mushrooms may be toadstools, the
oysters contain typhoid bacilli, mussels

the commonest, which will, no doubt,
add a piquancy to 'your life: Collapsing

ways; poisonous stings from Insects;

NEW WATER SUPPLY
To th,e Editor of The Call:
I note that there Is considerable inter
est In San. Francisco about a new water
supply. Where can a larger supply o.r
purer be found than on the south fork
of the American River at Lotus? Build
a dam 150 or 200 feet high at Dutch Bar,
the lower end of the Coloma Valley, and
make a lake ten miles ' long and six or
more wide of the finest water to be found
anywhere.^ Above Coloma the supply .of
water is .too limited for such a project
as is on foot, but at this point below
Lotus it is right. The land could be pur
chased at a reasonable price. Such a sup
ply of water would, be large enough to
furnish San Francisco. Oakland, Sacra
mento and other cities. If you are going
to do something, do it on a Callfornlan
scale. A NON-RESIDENT. "

A NOTABLE OPENING.
Elegance of Appointment Uneqnaled in
San Francisco.
To-day marks the opening of Mr. Ike
Deutch's new bar and merchants' lunch
at 413-415 Market street. For a number
of weeks artisans have been effecting a
complete transformation of the prem
ises and have achieved one of the hand
somest and most elegantly appointed
lunch places in the city. The dining
room is 250 square yards In area, is well
lighted and ventilated and will accom
modate twenty-flve tables that provide
a seating capacity for 100 guests amid
an atmosphere of comfort and cheerful
ness. Eleven oil paintings that con
tributed much entertainment to the for
mer patrons of the Crystal Palace,
which for six and a half years was con
ducted by Mr. Deutch, will provide keen
delight to the artistic sensibilities of
his guests.
The barroom shows distinct modern
treatment, being constructed of Peru
vian walnut, a natural wood of South
America that is new to purposes of in
terior decoration on the coast; while
nearly as bard as mahogany and sus
ceptible to an equal polish, it is of
lighter color and more open grain that
is free from the sombreness of mahog
any. At one side of the room is a se
ries of conversation booths, richly fitted
in walnut and leather that furnish a de
gree of seclusion to business men who
wish a few minutes of quiet conversa
tion apart from the crowd. Over all is
an ornamental beam ceiling of plaster
relief work, while antique brass fittings
and Uolophane pendant electric lan
terns provide brilliant illumination.
The kitchen is furnished with all
modern equipment that economizes time
and facilitates quick service.
A notable feature is the patent plas
ter flooring called X-olith, a scientific
sanitary preparation that is fireproof
and will stand a temperature of 2200
degrees before crumbling. While this
material is new in this country it has
been in use in Germany for more than
forty years, but is gaining great popu
larity here on account of its- durability
and sanitary qualities. It is used for
flooring and wainscoting, and where the
two Join there is formed a cove-corner
that prevents an accumulation of grease
and dirt. It Is readily cleaned and Is
particularly adapted to kitchens, bath
rooms, hospitals, etc. It is in use in the
St Francis Hospital and in all the de
pots and hospitals of the 8. P. Railway.
It is made by the X-olith Mfg. Co., 153

Mr. Deutch starts in business under

THE SAN FRANCISCO : CALL, -FRIDAY;. SEPTEMBER ,23- 11905/
judge: seaweli. upholds
contention of taxpayer
Decides In Favor of A. Cbesebrongh In
Suit Brought Against City and
County.
In the case of A. Chesebrough and
the executors of the will of the late
Charles Hanson against the City, and
County of San Francisco. Judge Sea
well handed down an opinion yester
day In which he holds that the taxation
of a part of the property of a corpora
tion and also of the shares of its stock
at their full cash value would be," to
the extent of the tax upon, the property,
a double taxation and hence illegal.
The facts Involved in the case â¢ are
these: â¢ \u25a0\u25a0â¢v/ I \V< \u25a0
The Inventory and appraisement of
the estate. of Hanson disclosed the fact
that it was the owner of 9998 shares of
stock in the Tacoma Mill Company, a
corporation organized under the laws
of California. This stock' was assessed
at 1 350,000. For - the fiscal year^ end-
Ing June 30, 1908, "taxes on- the I stock
to the amount of $6473 were paid lender
protest. Property represented;) by "the
stock, located in Washington, "was also
assessed for J27.000. In maklngythe
protest the plaintiffs claimed \that to
the extent of the assessment on the
stock to the amount of the value of the
property described It had in fact been
twice assessed. Judge Seaweli :upholds
this contention, saying:
The Legislature has not provided fc>r a case
such as thla, where only a part of the prop
erty of a domestic corporation Is assessable
In this Btate, and under the constitution the
Legislature alone has power to make such
provision. It Is true, as contended by de
fendant's counsel, that the Legislature has
no power to exempt shares of stock from taxa
tion. The difficulty here, however, is not that
the Legislature has attempted to exempt from
taxation shares of stock ' situated as these are,
but has made no provision for their assessment.

RAGAN REPORTS ON FISH.

a Â» tbe State Board of Health be Informed

the board can protect the Inhabitants of other

ter class .In cutting, ; eviscerating and serving
the fish upon dirty boards in their wagons

CUSTOM-HOUSE
SOON TO FALL
Plans for "New building
Denounced for Not Giving
Sufficient Boom for Work
LIKENED TO A BREAVEEY
Cdmplaint That Space Will
Be One-Third Less Than
Present Cramped Quarters
: Customs officials were daflnitely; notified
yesterday, that the new Quarters .on the
third "floor 'of 'the Appraisera'r. building
would '- be ready 'on J October 15 and ! that
the, work ' of .- removal '/ should -be ; begun
on that date.' Within a few days there
after the work of tearing down the old
building .will begin, -the contract having
been let for |12,000, the contractor to keep
the material. The i time allowed for the
building of- the new. Custom-house upon
the site \u25a0of \u25a0 the old - has ; been fixed * at
two Jyears/r but ;*it--'isi more than 'likely
that i this time will be" extended. - -
'_'\u25a0 The temporary new quarters in the
Appraisers', building "are : much g more
commodious than ' the ones ' to be moved
into, and customs officials and .brokers
say that they are \ much . more commodi
ous than ':.. the quarters planned 'in the
proposed .-, new : building. ; In fact they
positively' declare that' the plans for the
new building accepted by : the 1 Treasury
Department give them â¢ one-third .-- less
space " than \u25a0;- they have . In ; their : - present
crowded 'auarters. .not "to "speak of the
additional space that will be required by
the 7 time the building shall have been
finished. ". ;;-,;; J. :.
In connection with this matter an In
teresting story is told. It is to the effect
ihat prior to the drawing or acceptance
of the plans for the new . Custom-house
several \ customs officials * for the enlight
enment of the department made estimates
as to the floor, space that would be ab
solutely lndespensable for each . depart
ment They also grouped the various
offices with a view to the expedition of
business and the convenience of brokers
and the public, generally. For Instance,
in the 'ordinary course of business a
broker must take I his papers first to a
certain ofQce, then to another, and so on,
following a certain routine. Now, If these
offices are placed side by side or In the
same part of the building time and trou
ble will; be saved for all. Then again
certain officials must consult with certain
other officials or interchange j documents,
and' each official, for the same reason,
should be placed within reach of one
another. , It may easily be understood
that if officials must^. be going upstairs
or downstairs on such business the time
thus consumed unnecessarily will be
wasted and the business of thÂ« Custom
house will be I impaired to that 'extent.
With these considerations in mind the
offices were co-ordinated in the plan sent
to the Treasury Department. Then the
officials : and brokers awaited results.
They came like the impact of a club
upon the nape of the neck. In the words
of a gentleman noted for picturesque
ness, vigor ; and originality of language,
the architect planned the Custom-house
as ' if he , were drawing the designs for a
steem beer brewery.
And all the others are crying "Amen!"

BATTLE IS OVER
ERE BELL TAPS
Kaufmann .Earns Victory With
a Right Hook to Jaw.
SPE CIA TORS ARE SURPRISED
Surely no other candidate for heavy
weight pugilistic honors was launched on
h!s way to fame In such an impressive
and a sensational manner, as was big
Al Kajjfmann last night at Woodward's
pavilion. - He landed but one blow to
Karry Foley'e jaw. but that lone blow
carried with It enough steam to send
the seasoned and clever boxer down for
the count. â¢
The fight lasted precisely one minute
and twenty-five seconds. The finish came
so rapidly and was attended by such
startling circumstances that the specta
tors did not realize what had happened
until Kaufmann had been motioned to
his corner by .Referee Jack Welch.
Foley does not know yet what struck
him, but those at the ringside can assure
the vanQUished gladiator he was assailed
to the point of the Jaw with as pretty a
right hook as a boxer ever started.
Foley met his Waterloo tn his own cor
ner. He was smilingly dancing around
there, sidestepping the young Olympian,
when suddenly the latter sent a light
left to the body. Foley turned bis head
to one side and as he made this motion,
Kaufmann hooked over his right. It
went true to the point and Foley
dropped to the floor like the proverbial
log.
HAHBYFOLEY IS GROGGY.
He was groggy and lingered on the
mat about seven seconds. Then he arose
to his knees and clutched at the ropes.
Again he sank to the canvas and again
he came up. In the meantime the time
keeper was fast tolling off those fatal
tea seconds. In fact, he tolled off eleven
ere Foley rose to his feet, groggy and
dazed and as helpless as a babe.
Referee Jack Welch placed his hand on
Kaufmann's shoulder and proclaimed
him the victor. Foley wanted to fight
again and his seconds claimed he was
not knocked out. Every, one In the vi
cinity of the ring plainly heard the time
keeper say eleven, and that was all.
Even If be was not yet out, Foley could
never have withstood another wallop, for
the big Olympian stood over him, ready
to finish him for keeps.
The* end jcame so suddenly that no- one
had a' chance to get a line on the ex
pride of the winged *'O." Never In his
career as a" boxer has Kaufmann gone
more than a round with any man. He
finishes his opponent with one wallop,
ahd laet nisht did not waver from his
usual course of proceedings.
?io one can tell from his 6howing last
night .whether Kaufmann'S' .veins are
coursed by championship blood. Every
one who saw that punch will admit that
Al has a wallop in that right hand that
will bring him home- the money, in any
ring if he can land it. Some may say the
Olympian started with a lucky wallop.
That may be. but he took advantage of
tne first opening that presented Itself,
and as an amateur he should be given
due credit for this. Foley left an open
ing and Kaufmann was quick to see It.
That briefly is the story of the remark
able battle. No boxer ever made a more
sensational . debut as a professional.
When the gong sounded the men fiddled
around anfl sparred for an opening. Their
tactics were not at all to the liking of\the
gallery gods, who soon began to sug
gest that they tell their mothers to start
something or get out of the ring. Kauf
mann was the first to lead, shooting out
his left. It was a bit short and soon aft
er they came to a clinch. That was all
till Al whipped in the final blow.
Kaufmann shaped- up In the ring in
magnificent condition. He seemed to
tower several Inches over his opponent
and had the advantage of reach, height
and weight. Kaufmann was as brown
as a berry and looked in the pink of con
dition for a long fight. Foley also shaped
up well, though he appeared a bit thin
and weak-looking alongside his vigorous
young opponent. ,
There was a broad smile on the face
cÂ£ Veteran Billy Delaney as be walked
out into the middle of the ring to greet
his latest discovery- It could be plainly
seen thatl the king of all trainers was
agreeably Eurprised to see his boy bring
home the money in guch record time. He
admitted lie was astounded, but added he
felt perfectly sure Al was going to bring
the punch "over soon.
From his showing . last night. Kauf
mann Is certainly entitled to- meet any
of the big heavyweights, barring Jef
fries.- now before the public. If- dope
counts for anything it will have to be,
a good man who can manage to last
more than a round with him. Many
liave already tried It, but it has always
been the same old story.

thing that made it appear bad in any
way. For the last few days all the wise
ones were offering to wager 10 against
6 that Kaufmann would bring home the
coin. Yesterday the price dropped to" 2
to 1, with no Foley takers, and at the
ringside some of the talent were wager
ing 10 to 3 and 4. \u25a0 -
It~is a well-known fact that . Harry
Foley never was able to take a punch
to the Jaw. That portion of his anatomy
has always been his veak point and any
good man who was able to hit him
there invariably put him away. Last
night was no exception to â¢ the rule, for
as soon as Foley was - struck he wilted
and withered and his legs began to
tremble under him before he sank to the
carpet a beaten man. He thought Kauf
mann could not hit him, but he knows
better this morning.
The preliminary between Charley Dunn
and Bob Cairns, the well-known light
weights, was a fast affair. It was award
ed to the former after ten rounds of
fierce milling. Cairns did the most work,
but Dunn jj proved a veritable Battling
Nelson, boring in and taking a beating
from the outset. Cairns was not at all
careful in the matter of covering up and
Dunn shot in several ugly lefts and
rights to the \u25a0 head and body that shook
his man up. >
A small crowd saw the contests. The
upper " gallery was . fairly filled, but the
balcony and the main floor 1 presented an
almost dismal aspect. Those In attend
ance came prepared to witness a long
struggle and therefore the disappoint
ment that prevailed when the punch was
landed by Kaufmann can easily be
imagined.
JOHNSON TAKES
THE OFFENSIVE
Scores Continental Building
and Loan Association and
Officers of the Society
SACRAMENTO, Sept. 2S.â Up to the
last hour of the Emmons trial to-day
the testimony was confined to the recital
of character by witnesses summoned by
the defense in the effort to Impeach
George N. Tichenor and Henry Hartling.
Then Grove L.. Johnson, attorney . for
Emmons, precipitated his lpng . expected
attempt to exploit the affairs of the Con
tinental Building and Loan Association.
W. J. Palethorpe, an expert accountant,
armed with the facts and figures secured
as a stockholder, was placed on . the
stand, but the defense had asked but a
single vital question when vigorous ob
jection was made by the prosecution.
The argument that followed included
some vigorous attacks by Johnson upon
the Continental, Gavin McNab and Wil
liam Corbin. The admlssibllity of fne
evidence was not decided by Judge Hart,
but was left until to-morrow morning.
Palethorpe was asked If he had made
an examination of the affairs of the Con
tinental Association. Objection was made
and Johnson was asked to explain the
purpose of this testimony. In reply
Johnson said:
We expect to show by this wltneei the con
dition of the Continental Bulldlnff and Loan
Association at the time the Legislature con
vened and during- December, 1904, and Janu
ary, 1905. We expect to demonstrate the
necessity for investigation and to show that
the action of the committee was proper. We
expect to show that the Continental Buildinr
and Loan Association was insolvent when the
committee started.
We expect to show the motives of Gavin
McNab and William Corbin; that their action
was not for. any honest purpose, but to pre
vent exposure. We expect to show that Gavin
McNab knew the condition of the Continental
and knew it through the report of this expert,
accountant, which revealed the fact that th^
company was ini<olve<it, but had nevertheless
raised and doubled the salary of the president
Dr. Washington Dodge; the secretary. William
Corbin. and the attorney, Gavin McNab
We expect to show that Corbin had over
drawn over 521J.000. and that the whole prose
cution has. beeÂ£ suggested In pursuance of a
plot and was fotten up by the Continental to
besmirch the reputations of men who would
have investigated its affairs. â¢Â«>"u
Seymour objected to the Introduction of
this testimony. Johnson then safd:
We deny that any money was ever mkhi
by Jordan to the defendant and wo nr^fiÂ«
that the defendant will go on the stand n 2
swear that he did not this money
WÂ« are prepared to show that the mone/^as
never passed and that the testimony to That

for this undertaking, ta hta "waL^hitS?"'
The witness was withdrawn and thÂ«
court took the question and objection
under advisement for decision to-morrow
morning. '\ w f ow
A. M. Seymour, District Attorney of
Sacramento County, was called as a wit
ness for the defense by. Johnson. Reply
ing to questions Seymour swore that he
had taken no advice from McNab ;In re
gard to his actions in this case. He said
he objected to the accused Senators be
ing sworn as witnesses at the Senate In
vestigation, because he believed that If
that had taken Place .they would* have
been no longer liable to prosecution. He
denied that he was Iri/luenced by any
building and loan association to \u25a0do so
and said. he was guided by his sense of
duty. He might have told McNab he was
going to object, but he did not take ad
vice from McNab.'

The benders which Charley Baum
produced at Recreation Park yesterday
were breaking and twisting around
; that plate In suoh a bewildering 'man-
S ncr that the Seals never had a chance
to grab any runs. Inning after Inning
passed and still the- Seals could not
make good. In the meantime tho An
gela copped two, enough to carry them
through safely. :
Outside of the fourth spasm Hitt was
equally as clever as Baum, but the
Angels managed to bunch a- flock of
scratchy hits on him then and/there
and won out. Bernard bingled out
to the center-and stole. Smith chased
him to third with a liner to left and
Brashear dumped a bunt which 'Hitt
was too slow in fielding at the pan.
Cravath managed to put a dinkey little
bouncer outside of Mohler's reach and
Smith raced to the pan in time to beat
\u25a0 the return throw." ' j
Both teams handled the leather In* a
fast and snappy manner around the in
field. The Angels pulled Baum out of
several bad holes T>y fast, clean work.
Baum got away with seven chances
and figured in two double plays, all of
which helped him in the' run for vic
tory. The score:

SPOKANE, Sept. 28.â Emerson kept
the Oakland men guessing which 3 way
the ball would bend, : only two of the
Commuters making a guess that netted
a hit. He had good control and refused
to give passes when harmful. Add ) to
this the sharp fielding by the Tigers
and Oakland's failure to reach third
base Is explained. A broken jaw keeps

J. B. Haggin Orders Dis
persal of World's Most
Famous Breeding, Farm
AUCTION ES T DECEMBER
Golden Garter, Watercress,
Star JRuby and Others to
Go Under the Hammer
LEXINGTON'. Sept 23.â The world-fa
mous breeding establishment. Rancho del
Paso, near Sacramento. Cal., la to^-i^
discontinued as a breeding stud for thor
oughbred h,orses. TWa announcement
was made to-night by C. H. Berryman.
manager of J. B. Haggin'a Elmendorf
stud In this county, on Instructions from
Mr. Haggln In New â¢ York. Tha horses
are to be sold at public auction, during
the first week of December. Thera arÂ«
about 706 head. Including thirty-five stal
lions, among them Star Ruby, 'Water
cress, St. Galien, Goldfinch, Golden Gar
ter. Imp Toddlngton and others. Rancho
del Paso consists of 44.000 acres, 6000 of
which are used for thÂ» breedta* of thor
oughbreds.
ThÂ« passing of Rancho del Paso la the
most tremendous happening possibly la
all the history of thoroughbred racing.
From Its paddocks since ISS7. when Its
first crop of yearlings were offered at
public auction, have come some of tha
most famous horses on the American
turf. No other two men In the world
ever bred thoroughbred horses on the
scale successfully carried out by ilr.
Haggin.
While the horses have always been
sold under hla name or raced â¢ under his
colors, he had a silent partner. Lloyd
Tevls In his lifetime, and his heirs elnco
then, have always had a half Interest
In all the property standing In his name
In California.
Thus when Salvator. Flrenze and other
turf stars were setting- the Eastern turf
world aflame in the early 90"s In the
famous Haggin colors of blue with
orange sleeves, they were as much thf
property of Mr. Tevls as they wera oK.
Mr. Haggin. r^
The betting operations of Mr. Haggin
and of his son. Ben All. finally reached
such proportions that ilr. Tevls called
a halt. He said he would ask for. an
accounting and a dissolution of partner
ship if another horse -went to the post
with, the Haggin colors up. The racing
stable was disbanded. Hj^ifHf
In recent years Mr. Haggin has aa â¢ a
matter of sentiment raced Waterboy and
a few other horses he bred on his "own
establishment at Elmendorf. Ky.
The decision to breed no more horses at
Rancho del Paso was probably caused
by the unsatisfactory condition of the
thoroughbred horse market. The pro
hibition of racing In the Middle - West
by the authorities has closed a wide field
to the horses. . ..'..,
With the passing of Rancho del Paso
will go Superintendent. John Mackey,
himself as widely known as the 'famons
farm. He^ has traveled the world over
buying- horses for Mr. Haggin and has
entertained the principal buyers of the
world at Sacramento.

KHIRON HALED
BEFORE MOGAN
Man of Many Aliases Is Ar
raigiied in Court on a
Charge of Graiid Larceny
STILL SEEKING VICTIMS
Cunning Fortune-TellefWKo
Duped Robert Gibson Is
Not Feazed by His Arrest
"-;, Herbert Khiron, alias Corbin, alias
Del Mar, - alias Burt, palmist," seer- and
trance > medium, was arraigned } before
Judge Mogan yesterday on a charge of
grand 1 larceny, by triclt and device. J.
D. Lee . and; BrucÂ« \u25a0 Kimmis, ;f .:. both 'of
whom were mixed up " in similar deals
before Khiron duped : Robert* Gibson,
a car conductor,; from ;; whom : ha -"ob
tained : $80," and they : are "wanted, '\u25a0 but
have \ escaped. 'â¢â¢ â¢\u25a0 '. â¢'.
-Since Ane news of Khiron's brazen
methods came* out \u25a0in The Call, - Gibson
has; received letters from othtr""vic
tims. * George Prince, whom "Khiron
â¢swindled out of $40, wrote to Gibson
from Willits that he would v help ; bear
the - expenses of prosecuting: the faker.
Gibson deolares that he will do all in
his power to land Khiron behind the
bars. '::-y :.-:- '\u25a0â¢\u25a0.\u25a0 '.' .\u25a0'\u25a0:\u25a0." 'â¢ v: .' : -v^ -â¢\u25a0_
.With ; -the effrontery of hlÂ« class.
Khiron has opened another office at 114
Geary street. Here he has been tracked
by Gibson;fwho declares that more vio
tims are; being relieved of- their dol
lars. He'has an'office sign bearing the
name Del 'Mar and calling himself a
psyoh'V medium, etc. He lives in style
BX^lB Geary street. His home Is fur
nished luxuriantly.
The game by which he duped Gibson
is. a ve.ry simple j one. Gibson believed
the claim that the medium could bring
fortune in business. The victim had
$800 and let Khiron into the secret.
'. The ; seer closed his eyes ; and '-, looked
into the future. All that he could see
was Cygnet oil stock.'. Gibson was du
bious, but the cunning fortune teller
convinced him that it would be a good
investment.. Khiron took the victim "to
J. D. Lee and Bruce Kimmis, his con
federates., ii'uii
In 'the offlce of the mythical Cygnet
Oil I Stock Company.; the trio'!unloaded
some shares on Gibson and ; took the
$800.' ; Khiron contrived â¢to look into
the future for 'Gibson and. saw the oil
stock going up all the time.
Finally Gibson became suspicious and
investigated. He learned': that there
was no such corporation as the Cygnet
Oil Company. The victim demanded
the return of his money. Driven to.a
corner, the fortune teller returned J2OO
arid gave notes for the rest. He has
not made any further restitution. .
Though trapped completely and with
a charge against his name, Khiron is
still waxing fat: on the dollars of the
Ignorant -in v his new office; at >114 Geary
street under his latest alias, r ."
Judge Mogan set his ball at $600 cash
and ordered him to appear for prelimi-
nary hearing on October G.
BIJESTING OF WATER
MAIN STOPS WORK
Engine Raising Sand at
New Butler Euilding
Caves In.
The excavations I for the new Butler
building, now in course of construction
at 'the corner: of Geary : and \u25a0 Stockton
streets, came to -a sudden stop yesterday
afternoon. : This was , occasioned by the
bursting of the water main, which was
located under the donkey engine, which
is used to help Moist up the sandfrom the
deep - excavations now. going on there.
The great amount of- earth which has
been . hauled away for the foundations of
the building had weakened the. asphalt
pavement on Stockton street and , caused
it to , crack and sink toward . the place
where the excavations were going on.
The result was that yesterday afternoon
the strain burst: the water -main, and
water commenced to gush up to the
street. Little by little the sand under
the . street began . to flow away and ";\u25a0 run
down into ~ the excavated ;. lot. J Finally
the , asphaltum of the, street giveaway,
and the donkey engine fell in with a
crash. J. M. Simmons; the foreman for
the American-Hawaiian \ Engineering and
Contracting Company ,\who \u25a0 has the con
tract for putting; up the building, blames
the Spring Valley Water Works for; the
sinking of the- engine and the loss of
time to his * company. He says * he ; noti
fied the engineer : of ; the water -company
at 2:30 p. \u25a0 m; that the 'main had" burst
and asked him to shut off the * water.
He says : he \u25a0 did not bo % until ; 4:20,
which was nearly two ; hours [afterward.
In the meantime the water poured down
Stockton ! street and ran down . O* Farrell
street in torrents until It* reached \u25a0 Grant
avenue, where - It ' ran into the , sewer."
What water did; not ; run [down the
streets poured . down '; into the "\u25a0'\u25a0 deep ex
cavations *of the ! Butler $ lot, . and * for . a
time threatened *to undermine the build
ings adjoining.:.. '

Clasli Cher Handwriting
iii the New Davis Codicil
MA^T SPRING StJBPBISE
It -Is Thought the Defense
' Has Letter of Late Capital
ist 'Mentioning Document
The submission of samples of hand
writing of the late capitalist. Samuel
Davis, was brought to an end yester
day l af terno Â°n in the courtroom of
Judge Kerrigan with the entry of "the
three hundred and seventh-exhibit by
the /counsel for the .contestants. : The^
exemplars consist of specimens of the
handwriting in letters, notes, legal
documents, figures and checks; and" will
be - used by the contestants in ! an J effort
to show ; that 1 the codicil 7 : is . a forgery. .
Next Monday morning' will begin the
actual battle of Mary G. Stone and the
Mercantile Trust Company as executors
of the ] estate of '. Henry Davis for the
possession- of the Davis millions un
der the original will. Already the lo^
\u25a0cal handwriting experts, according to
the;'- contestants'. , counsel, have -pro
nounced the codicil a forgery, and they
will be called to , the \u25a0 stand to demon
.strata their opinion.. The> proponents
have *ent East for experts, and a great
fight is expected.;
â¢ i.The circumstances. ; surrounding the
discovery of .the- codicil have .such ~'j a
peculiar aspect that they are blamed as
the cause of the contest. . The attorneys
for ; the proponents, however, : maintain
that' these very circumstances will go
to prove the genuineness of the codi
ciL
When a petition to admit the orig
inal f will ; of . Samuel Davis .'to probate
was made the attorneys of the grand
nieces and .grandnephews: who. were
excluded from sharing "the estate ob
tained a stay, to enable them to make
a search of the effects of the Kate capi
talist. A' stay was granted, | and mean
while the attorneys for those :who are
now the proponents began to gather in;
San Francisco/ â¢ . ;
A. search lasting several weeks but
conducted 1 only a few : hours at- a time
by William 8.-Reis and Robert Day
brought to, light the . contested codi
cil. * This document, while remembering
the present contestants, cuts their
share almost in half by reducing ; the
original value of the estate by be
quests, and increasing the number of
those sharing the estate.
The principal Incident that gave rise
to the contest, however, was. the failure
to file the' codicil immediately upon its
discovery. This was not done until the
sixth day thereafter and gave rise to
suspicions. The codicil was taken to
local ; handwriting experts, and their
verdict increased the contestants' sus
picions. The document was pronounced
a forgery owing to the shakiness of
the handwriting, but the defense in
tends to show, by later evidence, that
the last writings of Davis, who was ill
and feeble, show -the same peculiarity.
That the defense \u25a0 has a big card up
its sleeve in the possession of a letter
written by Davis referring to the codi
cil and his intentions \ as to how ,ne
would distribute his wealth is not de-.
nied, and it remains^for the, contest
ants to prove .-that that letter is also
a. forgery. -\u25a0' \ \u25a0-'. \u25a0"-:\u25a0 \u25a0
INdUIRKS INTO NECESSITY
FOR A GREEK INTERPRETER

alders tbe Application.Â©* N. Val
lanos for the Position.
.' The Supervisors' Finance Committee
yestferday examined f the five inter
preters of the Police > and Superior
courts, with a view to determining the
extent of their duties: and the necessity
of hiring extra interpreters. The in
quiry resulted from a bill of $90 being
presented by N. - .Vilianos, who is not
regularly employed, for services tas
Greek interpreter. 'â-1
Interpreters Locke, C. H. Geffeney, A.
Glover, V. Demartini and R. M. Aguirre
Informed the committee of their abil
ity to interpret the several j languages
In which they are proficient, saying
they are subject to the call' of seven
criminal courts, the District Attorney
and I the Police Department. . . in
terpreters-were cut, from $125 to $100
when the charter' went into effect.
\u25a0Aguirre said x there ;is no necessity for
a Greek' interpreter; and he urged that
a room be provided for the interpreters
in the Hall of Justice.
Villanos, who has applied for the po
sition of Greek interpreter, said the
Greek colony is, rapidly: increasing and
the number X of. cases comingup war
ranted the employment of \u25a0 a competent
man.; The committee took ithe matter
under" advisement, but is disinclined ; to
employ ; another \ interpreter, as^ th^re
are no funds for the purpose. -The Po
lice Judges will be asked for their
opinion as to the necessity for the ap
pointment. , â¢ '_. -.

Oregon Crop Bulletin.
The report Â» of tdward A. Beais. section
director. United States Weather Bureau, for
the Oregon crop bulletin, week ended Septem
ber 26, iÂ« as fol!oV.-s:
TÂ»-.e i>ast week was warm and dry. except
that a few small showers occurred in ins
northwest portion oÂ£ the State. These Ehow
. ers \u25a0â¢Â«:>- very benencial to pastures and late
crops, such as corn, potatoes, cabbages, to
matoes, tunjips and carrcts. In the <lry Â£ec
tio&s o: the btate pasturage is very short and
rante stock is losing flesh and getting in bad
condition -to meet a ritorous winter should
oae occur. - Hops- and prunes have nearly all
been gathered.. The hop crop turned out much
better tiian expected,- both as to quality and
i <Â£isntity. \u25a0 Prunes it is estimated., yielded
a.*bout half of a full crop with the sizes larger
tÂ£Â»a usual. Potato digging lÂ» general. -The
crop is :ree Trom blight, but in consequence
of the . dry cummer it is expected that the
yieids will, n&t be so heavy as usual. Apple*
ln-weli-ker>t orchards "will yield -froai fair to
good returns; ia other orchards the crop is.
poor. The coil is etill too hard for fall piow
inÂ£ ar.d teeding ard but little of this work
ha* t*-en cone.
Good reins set in after most of the re-
PGru on which this bulletin Is based had
bee& called. * These rains will greatly lm
prcre pasturage and late crops in the drier
sections of the State, acd also soften the
rrour.d so as to permit a Urge amount of
f*U plowing and seeding to be done provided
the weather afterward Is favorable.

which 1* lower than the reserve has stood, for
many years The action of the bank is thus
made clear after allowance' is made for the

whtch is "ear-marked" for the Indian" Govern

in the tterilng rate at ParU also indicated the
Â«fL>c: en theâParis money market. The effect

improvement of funds frcm that center to the
s.gr ! cultural districts, and thp New York rate
cf exchange at Chicago receded to 20 per cent
dlneouct as a result of transferring tho pres

T^eir Hard Struggle Made Easierâ lnteresting State-
ments by a Young Lady in Boston
and One in Nashville, Term.
(w!iÂ»fhankie Qrser nPi*MsiPear/4 eker *S?)
AU women work; some in their'
homes, somo in church, and some in
the whirl of society. And in stores,
mills and shops tens of thousands are
on the never-ceasing treadmill, earning
their daily bread.
All are subject to the same physical
laws: all suffer alike from the same
physical disturbance, and the nature of
their duties, in many cases, quickly
drifts them into the horrors of all
kinds of female complaints, ovarian
troubles, ulceration, falling and dis-
placements of the womb, leucorrhosa,
or perhaps irregularity or suppression
of "'monthly periods," causing .back-
ache, nervousness, irritability and
lassitude.
Women who stand on their feet all
dar are more susceptible to these
troubles than others.
They especially require an invigorat-
ing, sustaining medicine which will
strengthen the female organism and]
enable them to bear easily the fatigues
of the day. to sleep well s.t night, and
to rise refreshed and oheerful.
How distressing to see a woman
gtrag-glincr to earn a livelihood or per-
form her household duties when her
back and head are aching, she is so
tired she can hardly drag about or
stand up. and every movement causes
pain, the origin of which is due to
some derangement of the female or-
ganise;. â

Dear Mrs. Pinkham: â - " â¢
" I suffered misery for several yÂ«ars with
irregular menstruation. Mr back ached; I
had Dearing down pains, and frequent head-
aches: I could not sleep and could hardly
dra? around. I consulted two physicians
without relief, and as a last resort, I tried
Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Compound, and
to my surprise, every ache and pain left me.
I gained ten pounds and am in perfect health. "
Miss Pearl Ackers of 327 North Sum-
mer Street, Nashville. Term., write*: ,
Dear Mrs . Pinkham :â
"I suffered with painful periods, severe
backache, bearing-down pains, pains across
the abdomen ; was very nervous and irrita-
; ble, and my trouble grew worse every month,
"My physician failed to help me and I
decided to try Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable
Compound. I soon found it was doing me
good. All my pains and aches disappeared,
and I no longer fear my monthly periods."
Lydia E. Pankham's Vegetable Com-
! pound is the unfailing cure for all these
troubles. It strengthens the proper
muscles, and displacement \u25a0with all its
horrors will no more crush you.
Backache, dizziness, fainting, bear-

HUSBAND IS PENITENT,
WIFE RESOLUTE.
HE BEGS. : FOR MERGY
With Reluctance She Finally Agrees to Give
Him Another Chance to Show Manhood.
JAMES C. CRAWFORD.
Mrs. Hannah Adamson. of 6 Har
rison avenue was not . easy â¢ to : convince
that six months' Imprisonment had chas
tened the j tyrannical | spirit of her; spouse,'
and' it was with some, difficulty \', that Po
lice Judge I Mogan", persuaded j her to : con
sent , to his j : dismissal on probation in
stead of his reconsignment to prison for
another half-year I term.
â¢ " 'E's a bad 'un," MeclarediMrs. Adam
son, , "an* ye cawn't* maike .me believe
that 'c's sorry for- wot 'c did an' means
to dodifferent if I taike Mm 'ome with
me."
"Naow, 'Annah, ye knaows better than
that," pleaded the apparently penitent
Mr. Adamson. "Give me another
chawnce, cawn't ye?" he almost whined.
"No, Handrew, I daon't knaow better'n
that," 'she responded, mimicking his tone.
"I does knaow mat ye' ve been a brute
all yer life, an" that ye cawn't be made
a hangel In six months â naow, nor in
six years niyetherâ that's wat I knows."
The Judge directed the woman's atten
tion to the physical evidence of the man's
soul-dejection and reminded her that it
spoke more eloquently than aid his oral
professions of repentance and reform.
From a sturdy fellow Mr. AMamson'had
been transformed by prison fare and
confinement into an animated clothes
rack, and his once round and ruddy face
was both pinched and sallow.
"Another six months in jail would
qualify him to pose as a living skeleton,"
remarked - the Judge.
"'E does look run : daown, an' ; that's
a fact," . said the wife; "but while 'c's
been a-losing flesh â¢ th* children an' me
'aye been a-gainin' it. We gets along
better without 'avin'. '!m at 'ome,' an'
ye may put 'im away again for all as I
cares."
" 'Aye pity, 'Annah; "aye pity,',' im
plored the unhappy defendant.
"Wat pity did ye 'aye on me an' th'
kiddles w'en ye spent yer watges for
drink an' beat us w'en ye came 'ome?"
was the unyielding response.
. The Judge finally prevailed upon the
woman to relax her determination, the
condition being that during suspension of
sentence the husband is- to report ; once
a week to the court and contribute a -fair,
proportion of his. earnings, as soon as he
obtains employment at his trade of car
penter, to the support of his family.
â¢" 'E can come 'ome an'- try. it again,"
said the lady, "but if 'c fails to keep 'is
word, I shan't be hastonished." ,
'Mr. Adamson was -arrested one day
last April on his wife's complaint, and
Judge Mogan pronounced him guilty of
battery and peace disturbance and gave
him . six months' imprisonment on the
former charge, reserving sentence on the
latter until the six months expired. The
man was then both - strong of body and
defiant of demeanor, but his jail experi
ence reduced his avoirdupois and weak
ened his spirit, while the woman's im
munity from his 'brutal .treatment evi
dently fortified her both physically l and
mentally in corresponding , degree.
" Seventeen-year-old . Robert McNeil had
been employed but -a few hours' in the
dry-goods store of Julius Gloch,' 738 Mis
sion street, when! he pilfered "an ermine
neckwrap worth $25, pleaded -toothache
and went and disposed^ of. his plunder.
When he returned to the store some tell
tale hairs on . his collar betrayed- hfs of
fense, and now "Judge Mogan is going to
sentence him for petty larceny.
Bernard Gafi'ney advertised in the
newspapers about six months ago that
he would not be responsible for the debt 3
contracted by his wife, 1 Amilda, because,
as he naively , explained, she 'was :so
reckless In thf> : matter of incurring pe
cuniary obligations that his earnings as
a steamftttor atrthe-gas works were
inadequate to meet them.';. Soon,after
ward,' '.however, .a reconciliation : ; was
apparently. . effected, ; , and the : couple
dwelt in seeming amity until last Wed
nesday* even ing. ;wheri Bernard was ar
rested " for. battering Amilda and biting:
an arm â¢of i: her^ seventeen-year-old son.
Then it : was disclosed;. that r peace :had
never, been;: fully 'restored to'the :Gaff
ney household at 66 Brosnan street. â¢
Mr. Gaffney alleges \ that; Amilda, i her
brother, and her son attempted to ; oust
him from the domicile."^ the 'purchase
price of which; he is: paying In*- monthly
installments,' and ;that '. In the struggle
he may have accidentally ' struck : the
woman,. but :lp positive he did not bite
the "boy. 1 Amilda, ?; on I the .other hand,
avers that both Y the t battery \u25a0_ and 'the
mayhem Were deliberately committed. ',\:
' Judge ' Conlan '\u25a0 will hear .- more ; details

Judge \u25a0 Fritz , was to have handed- down
a decision in the case of ,W.F. Hopkins,
accused .of j having attempted ! to murder
JarAes McGinley by. stabi-.ng him> with a
knife, but at the designated time, 12:30

grapher enlisted Judge Mogan to formally
continue the case another week on motion

day evening -Mrs. JonaÂ« ' visited: Â« him
there for the alleged purpose of getting
money with which to â¢ purchase food,
she having nothing eatable in the house
with the exception of bread. Mr. Jonas,
however, accused her of being prompted
by groundless Jealousy, to hound him.
and a 'brisk exchange of compliments
ensued. I after, which the" : lady.' returned
homeward, escorted, by Charlie-(surn

lie and, then blackened one of her eyes.
. Not only â¢ did ' MrJ Jonas pronounce , his
better half's accusation absolutely untrue,
but hÂ« informed ; the : court , that she* had
permitted his " unjust suspicion 'i of it- his
marital unfaithfulness 'to . unbalance her

These, " together with : the terrible pic
