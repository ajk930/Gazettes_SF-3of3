CHIEF WITTMAN SUSPENDED ON CHARGE OF INCOMPETENCY
A S a sequel to the trial of Sergeant Ellis, who was found guilty last night of neglect of duty for failing to sup
-l** press gambling in Chinatown, the Police Commissioners preferred charges of neglect of duty and incompe
tency against Chief Wittman. He, too, must share responsibility for the failure of the "squad" to stamp out fantan.
The Chief was suspended pending his trial and Captain John Spillane will serve in his place temporarily.

Special ' IHspatch to The CaJL
CALL BUREAU, POST BUILDING,
WASHINGTON. Feb. Without a
single dissenting vote or voice the
House to-day adODted the most drastic
anti-trust resolution yet considered in
Congress. It provides for an investiga
tion of the Standard Oil Company from
top to bottom by the Department of
Commerce and Labor.
The resolution was introduced by
Representative Campbell of Kansas,
â¢with the special object of investigating
the oil situation in that State, but it is
much broader in ' scope, 'and requires
the Secretary of Commerce and Labor
to Investigate the whole . organization,
capitalization, profits and management
of the business.
This resolution is even more sweeping
than that presented by Martin of South
Dakota, which was th. basis of Com
missioner Garfield's investigation of the
beef trust. The fact- that it was adopt
ed -by the. House unanimously, without
even reference to committee, is - most
elgniflcant of the disposition iof the
popular branch of Congress in regard ,
to anti-trust measures. . '.*
Campbell "will consult with President j
Roosevelt to-morrow. At a conference |
â with Commissioner Garfleld yesterday
he made a personal request for. an in

ACCUSATION FOLLOWS
JUDGMENT OF GUILTY
IN THE ELLIS CASE
Head of Department
Held to Share Re
sponsibility.
SPILLANE HAS CHARGE
George W. Wittman, Chief of Police
of San Francisco, was charged ta^t
night by the commission with neglect
of duty and incompetency and at once
suspended from duty pending disposi
tion of the case.
The sensational action of the Police
Board came as the denouement of thf
trial of Sergeant Thomas P. Ellis, and
the accusation against the Chief is
based on testimony that was developed
at; to the -tre vaJenca of gambling in
Chinatown and the failure of the de
partment to stamp it out.
Kllis was found guilty, but sentence |
was deferred one week. Then Commis- :
sioner Ragan began making- the mo
tions that brought Wittman down from !
his high station, and the wind-up was \
the promotion of the senior captain of |
the force. Captain John Spillane. who
commands the Southern district, to bÂ«
temporary head of the department.
li was made plain why the Commis- i
sioners have been so Searching and J
their inquiries so far-reaching in the
hearing of the charges against Ellis.
The attempt was made again last night
to gain from the grand jurors what the
sergeant confessed to them of bribery
and corruption in Chinatown. Wit
nesses innumerable had been called in
an effort to establish that fantan ran
riot. At every opportulty the fact was
emphasized that a diligent sergeant
like Cook at the head of the squad now
has all the suppressed.
SOUGHT CAfiE AGAINST CHIEF.
It looked very much throughout the
protracted hearings as if the board was
straining itself beyond necessity to
make out a case against Ellis. It went
into things that seemed entirely irrele
vant to the giiarges against him. But
the glare was turned on last night, and
clear as holy script was it that the
Commissioners had been chiefly en
gaged in gathering evidence on which
to found charges against Chief Witt
man.
Hew far thp commissfnn was justified
in its course remains to be determined.
The Chief must have an opportunity
for a fair trial and he will avail him
self of it with vigor. Some say that
the move was deliberate to oust him
and that >t is programmed that San
Francisco shall have a new head for
the Police Department, others explain
that the members of the board were
provoked to the step because of pique
engendered by the Grand Jury's re
port.
But it cannot be gainsaid that there
was a stealthiness in the manner of
the board in approaching their move
that had an unpleasant savor. Under
the guise of trying Sergeant Ellis be
cause he neglected his duty in allow
ing the fantan games to run. there was
energetic reaching out for evidence to
condemn Wittman. In the light of the
Grand Jury report that Ellis had ac
cepted bribes to the amount of $2000
there needed not have been much dilly
dallying with him. But the scheme
was deep, well hidden, and the oppor
tunity excellent for digging trut an ac
cusation against Wittman.
That the case of the sergearft was
much overshadowed was forcibly dem
onstrated in the wide difference in the
courses pursued in regard to him and
â  the Chief. Wittman was suspended di
| rectly the charges were made. Ellis
has been on duty every day since the
accusation was filed against him, and
he is still on duty notwithstanding that
he has been found guilty or neglect of
duty in failing to stop fantan.
DID NOT STOP GAMBLING.
The burden of the charges against
Chief Wittman is that he is account
able for the failure of the various
squads that have taken their turns in
Chinatown duty to prevent gambling.
Thp commission holds him directly
responsible. It has arways been the
purpose of the board to place the re
sponsibility of this work on the shoul
ders of the Chief. To this end thÂ»
sergeant in command of the squad
has reported directly to the Chief and
not to his captain, as is the usual
course.
That the fantan and lottery games
I were never cleared out thoroughly
was unquestionably proved during thÂ«
Ellis hearings. But there is a grave
question, say those dispose*} to defend
the police, whether it is possible to do
so. It looks as if the case can be
made out against Wittman. however,
if there is a plan afoot to have a new
Chief of Police. It cannot be denied
that the department has never been

able to cope successfully with the
problem of downing the strong trnit
of the wily Chinese to play at eh
S> rgeant Cook has things very well
under control at the present time. But
the fact remains that he must mak^
raids every day almost, and that
games do start up despite his vig
ilance. Cook himself, when be'ore th^
board some time ago. shook his head
when asked if he thought it possible
to stamp out gambling among the
Chinese and said he doubted very
much if it < '.ul<l be >i<>ne permanently.
WITTMAN SURPRISED.
"I am under charges and suspend
f ed from the department, and it would
not be proper tor me to make a
statement at., this time." said Chief
Wittman in his office immediately af
| ter the adjournment of the Commis
sioners. "The action of the board
was altogether a surprise to me. I
was not looking for it. I will pre
sent my defense at the proper time.
This* is the first time that a Chief of
Police has been charged and sus
pended in the history of San Francis
co's department.
* "We have done our best to suppress
gambling in Chinatown, and it is not
an easy thing to do. I don't see how
I can be held accountable for the
acts of every man under my com
mand. Because a sergeant does not
do his duty or any policeman prove*
faithless, it is rather hard to hold
me responsible for his shortcomings,
I think. All I wish to say to the pub
lic at this time is that I will defend
myself, and, I feel assured, success
fully, when the charges come up for
hearing.
"I don't know of any plot to
me from th>- office of Chief of p
to make way for another, and I don't
believe there Is any."
It was after the case of Sergeant
Ellis was closed that the Commis>
ers retired to deliberate on the un
pect^d step against the Chi^f. They
came back in a very nervous state,
and Attorney Mni^n for the accused
sergeant had difficulty to sret calm
consideration of his formal motion
for dismissal of proceedings against
his client.
Reagan made the motions. El ha
was found guilty of the two charges
against him unanimously. By
other motion passing of sentence was
postponed a week.
REAGAN NKRVOrS AVD PAJLE.
Then Commissioner Reagan became
fidgety and pale. He didn't appear to
like the job before him.
"I move you now," he proceeded in
halting voice, "that in vie-w of the de
velopments during these proceedings
as to the failure of the department to
suppress gambling in Chinatown that
the secretary be instructed to prepare
charges against the Chief of Police for
negligence of duty and incompetence."
Commissioner Drinkhouse promptly
seconded the motion and with dis
patch it was carried by a unanimous
vote.
"Move we adjourn." said RÂ»agan.
The motion was carried hurriedly and
then the left his chair on half a run for
the door. "Don't want to talk to you,"'
he waved to the newspaper men.
Poheim and Drinkhouse remained in
their seats for a while, but they had
: no word for Wittman, who sat silent
1 and somewhat crestfallen. He then
! gathered up his papers quietly, and.
i without speaking a word to any one.
proceeded to hla offlc*. There he was
found to be not so broken In apirlt
a3 he had looked a few minutes be
fore. He was perfectly calm, almost
unperturbed it apo^ar^d. and seemed
fortified by the experiences in the
many storms that have raged about
him during his career in the depart
] ment.
NO PLOT ON FOOT.
"There is absolutely no truth in the
Statements that it has been the purpose
of the Commissioners for some time tÂ«>
get Wittman out of the office of Chief
of the department." declared Drink

Reagan thinks that the Grand Jury in

RAILROAD BILL CAUSES DEBATE
JOKER IS FOUND
IN MEASURE THAT
WALSH PRESENTS
Assemblyman Wey
and Declares It Is
Vicious.
Bp*cia! Dispatch to The Call
SACRAMENTO. Feb. 15.â Producing
ttlegrams that denounced the measure
as being inimical to the progress of
hi* part of the State, Assemblyman
Wryand this afternoon moved to re
consider the vote by which Walsh's
bill relating to railroad grade crossings
was passed last night. A debate that
i^anks as the warmest this session "of
th<* lower House has known followed.
"Walsh at once tried to make a motion
to lay on the table, but Weyand held
the floor and said:
This bill la far-reaching in its effects. It
practically s-huts out n*w railroads, particu
larly electric lines that have to run near

farther on. A new line may to-day cross on
the level and six -months later the road it
nouses may say it must go underneath. The
bill <s a vicious one.
"This bill has been on file in this
house some time.' said Walsh, "and 1
thought all the members had familiar
ized themselves with it. It has been
amended so that the railroad making
Kuch crossing may do so on the grade
level by putting in an interlocking sys
tem with suitable signals. In our
counts there is need of such a law.
The Santa Fe has built over the South
?rn Pacific In Oakland and the Realty
Syndicate in constructing its road has
built underneath."
"I am not convinced that this is a
vicious bill," said Drew of Fresno.
"It has some very good points. I have
received telegrams from half a dozen
business men in my county asking me
lÂ«> oppose it on the ground that it is a
bad bill."
Cromwell of Sonoma read several
telegrams from constituents, one say-
Ing: "The eyes of the people are on
your vote on this bill." and another:
"It will kn<*rk out competition and in
|ur<- Sonoma."
Speaker Prescott showed a great in
terest in th" measure by taking the
floor in its behalf. . He urged its pas
sage at once. The ground he stood on
was that of humanity. Many lives ,
would be Saved if overhead or under- I
neath crossings were established, he
said.
"Under this measure," said Weyand,
in closing, "existing roads can say to
new ones. 'You shall enter this State
as I dictate or not at aIL All pro
posed roads will remain paper roads If
this bill becomes a law."
Th. motion to reconsider was lost
by a vote of 40 to 30. last night's
strength of 41 votes remaining practi
cally unbroken.

In every respect, he said.
Burke of Alsmeda spoke against the
passage of th*Â» bill. "All through the
State there is a howl of a shortage of
funds,"' he said. "We don't know
where to get the money to keep up the
State prisons and reformatories. If

people carry it an expense of hundreds

"McKenney said he knew. from ex

BY NEW SYSTEM
School Fund Appor
tionment to Be
. Changed.
*
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO, Feb. 15.â Senator
Rowell's amended bill providing for
the reapportionment of the State
school fund on a basis of $250 per
annum for each teacher, the balance
of the fund to be apportioned on the
daily average attendance, will pass the
Legislature and, without doubt, receive
the signature of the Governor. Sena
tor Wolfe made a determined but un
successful attempt to-day to kill the
bill for the session. His failure means
a great loss to San Francisco for the
next few years, but, a? school Director
Roncovieri remarked to-night, it may
prove a blessing in disguise.
When the San Francisco Senate de
legation canvassed the vote and saw
the probability of the bill passing, it
sought a compromise, but the only
amendments it could get were a re
duction from $300 to $250 per teacher
and the change of the date for the bill
to go into effect to September 1.
When the bill came up in the Senate
this afternoon for amendment by the
author. Senator Rowell, Wolfe asked
that consideration of the measure be
Indefinitely postponed. In support of
his argument he presented a protest
which, he said, had been handed to
him by his constituents who \ are
directly interested in the measure.
This protest is in part as follows:
The Governor and the Superintendent of
Public Instruction, with the intention of Im
proving educational conditions In the sparsely
populated districts, have proposed a new
method of distributing the State, school fund,
based on the presumption that the State is in
duty bound to provide equal educational facil
ities for all its pupils, and, therefore, that
some mode of distribution must be adopted
that will compel the center* of wealth to come
to the apslFtance of the poor rural districts.
San Francisco last year not only supplied to
the State school fund the amount she after
ward drew out of it. but $248,000 more to go
to the help of the poor counties. The most
that any other county contributed in this way
was a little over $11,000, and yet San Fran
cisco would have acreed to a measure pro
posed which would have called upon her to
add nearly $100,000 more to her contribution
01 last year. We think she cannot fairly be
charged with unwillingness to do her share.
Under Senate bill 236 the following counties
would lose:
Alameda $43,290. Los Angeles $26,775. Marln
$261. Orange $15*47. San Bernardino $1797,- San
Francisco $215,495. San Mateo $443 and Santa
Clara $12,311.
The plan of distributing the greater portion
of the State fund in proportion to average
daily attendance, Instead of the total attend
ance. Is clearly a blow aimed at the counties
that have or in future may have their, schools
open for long annual terms.
Everything roes to show that the change*
In distribution proposed by Senate bill 23S
have not been well thought out, and are likely
to work great Injustice. ' ;'t
Wolfe's plan to Indefinitely postpone
was successfully' opposed by. Senator
Rowell, who said that the question had
been discussed from every phase for
the last several years and that none
better could be devised than that con
tained in the bill under discussion.
"I have Just been assured by School
Director Roncovieri of San Francisco,"
he said in conclusion, "that opposition
to the bill has been withdrawn by the
San Franciscans that came here to
oppose it." The bill was then amended
to conform with the later plans of the
author.
The bill will come up for final pas
sage before the end of the week.
The school fund apportionment bill
introduced by Assemblyman Slaven
was called up for second reading in the
Assembly this afternoon by its author.
Thompson of Ix>s Angeles offered an
amendment making the rate of ap
portionment of funds $250 per teacher
instead of $300. McGowan of San Fran
cisco introduced another providing that
the measure, if passed, shall go
into effect September 1, instead of July
1. Both were accepted by Slaven, the
final passage of the bill was made a
special order for next Wednesday and
the incident was closed for to-day.
Wednesday being a holiday the bill
will probably come up Thursday. Mc-
Gowan's amendment does not end the
efforts of the San Francisco delegation
against the bill as it stands. By ex
tending the time for the measure to
become operative, the metropolis will
be saved $80,000 ihis year of the $215,
000 it is doomed to lose each year if
the bill become a law, as the appor
tionment for this year will be made
before the date fixed by the amend
ment.
LEW WALLACE
RESPONDS TO
DEATH'S CALL
_4- â â
CRAWFORDSVILLE, Ind.. Feb. 16.â
General Lew Wallace, author of "Ben
Hur," one-time Minister to Turkey and
a veteran of the Mexican and Civil
wars, died at his home in this city to
day.- He was 78 years of age.
The health of General Wallace had
been waning for several years, and for
months, despite the efforts of the fam
ily to keen the public in ignorance of
his true condition, it has been gener
ally known that his vigorous constitu
tion cd\ild not much longer withstand
the ravages of a wasting disease. For
more than a year he had been unable
to properly assimilate food. At no time
has he ever confessed his belief that
the end was near, and his rugged con
stitution and remarkable vitality have
responsible for prolonging his life
several months.
The deathbed scene was one of calm
ntps. Besides his physician only his.
v. iff. his son and Henry Watkin of In
dianapolis were present. Two children
were in the house but were not admit
ted in the room. When told by his phy
sician that he was dying General Wal
lace was perfectly calm, and his last
words were expressions of cheer to his
grief-stricken family. Bidding them
farewell he said, "I am ready to meet
my Maker." He then lapsed into un
consciouÃness, from which he did not
recover.
No definite arrangements have been
made for the funeral.
Lewis Wallace was born in Brook
ville, Ind. on April 10. 1827. His father,
David Wallace, was elected Governor
of Indiana ten years later. His mother
was a daughter of Jude Test, a man
who played an important part in the
early judicial history of Indiana.

straints of KhooL His father was wont
to say that he had paid the lad's tuition

Prison Director Felton explained
that at San Quentin there are 1500
prisoners, with only 625 cells" to hold
them, while Folsom has 1000 prison
ers, with only 372 cells; in other words
that there are something under 1000
cells to hold 2500 prisoners.
The bills providing for the improve- J
ments needed, he said, contemplated
an appropriation of $218,000 for Fol
som and $360,000 for San Quentin, but j
under recent estimates the board was
confident that these sums could be re-
Auced at least $100,000 by the pur
chase of modern stone-cutting ma- ;
chinery. He said that in his opinion it
would take at least five years to com
plete the work and the appropriations
could be so arranged as to extend over
this period and work no great hard
ship on the people.

Ing which might have made of him an

In those days a white oilcloth cap, and

faithful likenesses of the clergyman

APPEALS TO

Hints at the Possibility
of War With Europe

CALL BUREAU, POST BUILDING,
WASHINGTON, Feb. 15.â President
Rcrosevelt this afternoon put the re
sponsibility for a war between the
United States and one or more Euro
pean powers, in the defense of the
Monroe doctrine, squarely upon the
Senate. He does not desire to be held
accountable for such complications as
may cause fighting to prevent acqui
sition of territory by foreign nations
on the western hemisphere or the
abandonment of the principles of the
Monroe doctrine.
In transmitting to the Senate the
treaty negotiated between Minister
Dawson and Premier Sanchez for
guaranteeing the integrity of Santo
Domingo and supervising that repifb
lic's finances, the President, In a spe
cial message, fully set forth his rea
sons for having engaged in this un
usual undertaking. He called the at
tention of the Senate to the conditions
prevailing in the South and Central
American republics. These Govern
ments, he said, had contracted indebt
edness abroad far beyond their means i
to repay. In view of the Monroe doc
trine, European nations had requested
the United States to assist them jn col
lecting the sums due, or to permit
them to compel payment in their own
way.
CRISIS IS APPROACHING.
The President believed the time was
rapidly approaching when the money
borrowed from" European brokers must
be repaid or the Governments whose â 
citizens had advanced it would take
steps to compel reimbursement. The
question of defending or abandoning the
Monroe doctrine would then arise, and
it should be decided now. He believed '
that in the immediate future, unless ;
the United States exercised general su- !
pervision over some of the South and j
Central American republics, foreign I
nations would become so impatient
that they would begin the collection of
their claims in their own way, and if
they could not get money they would ,
seize territory.
The President pointed out as to Santo :
Domingo that claims <">f many years'
standing remained unadjusted, and no :
effort was being made to liquidate
them. It was apparent that nothing
would be done in that direction without i
supervision by the United States, be- ;
cause continual revolutions lmpover- j
ished the country and made the accum- j
ulation of to pay debts lmpossi- !
ble. He called attention to the further j
fact that the United States was espe- j
cially interested in the caae of Santo '
Domingo, as an American firm had a j
claim of $4,500,000 awaiting setlement.
SCOPE OF THE PROTOCOL.
The purpose of the present treaty, he !
said, was to supervise the affairs of
Santo Domingo for a limited period and !
then turn them over to the Government ;
of the republic, with a warning not to !
again become Involved with foreign na
tions.
The treaty accompanying the letter
from the President provides that the
integrity of Santo Domingo shall be
maintained by the United States. This !
Government shall assume control of the
custom-houses and collect the reve
nues. Four ports of entry on the north
ern side of the island are to be devoted i
to paying the claim of the Santo Do- j
mlngo Improvement Company under;
the arbitral agreement already in ef- |
feet. The ports of entry on the south :
side of the island will be set aside for
the payment of foreign creditors. A !
certain percentage of the revenues col- j
lected will be turned over to the Gov- â 
ernment of Santo Domingo for its j
maintenance, and the remaining per
centage will be distributed pro rata
among the creditors. It is estimated j
that twenty-five years will be required i
to complete the liquidation of the vari- j
ous claims. It is stipulated that before j
becoming operative the treaty must be i
ratified by the United States Senate ,
and the Dominican Congress.
The special message of the President )
transmitting the treaty to the Senate |
was received with rather scant courtesy.

WANT COLLEGE FARM.
Senate Passes Bill Providing $150,000
for Agricultural Studies.
SACRAMENTO, Feb. 15.â Diggs' bill
providing for the appropriation of $150,
000 for the purchase of a farm for the
use of the college of agriculture of the
University of California passed the
Senate this morning. Carter spoke
against the measure, saying he be
lieved several smaller farms should be
purchased in different parts of the
State, that comprehensive investiga
tion of the 'different soils and varied
crops of different sections might be
made. Senator Ward differed from
Carter, however, and said he favored
the purchase of the farm and was posi
tive there is no crop grown in the
State that couldn't be experimented
with and benefited at a farm located
somewhere in the center of the State.
Senator Anderson said that though
he favored the bill he would not vote
for it unless favorable action was as
sured- upon an Assembly bill appropri
ating $50,000 for the purchase of an ex
perimental station in the southern por
tion of the State. Senator Shortridge
I called Anderson's attention to the fact
' that a provision in the Penal Code for
bids an effort to force a trade

i for the vote on his bill was then made

Self-praise won't get you a job.
George C. Sargent, in behalf of the
town of cars, explained that it is a
community of home-loving people and
that those who have gone their for
quiet abodes would have their ex
pectations defeated If saloons were al
lowed to find place freely.
"I understand that there were only
six people present at your meeting
when you adopted the resolutions cen
suring us for granting Dahl's license."
said President Poheim. Sargent
had not been present, but Secretary
Morchus of the Ocean Boulevard Im
provement Club announced that there
were over sixty people at the meeting.
About twenty of them came before the
commission as a committee.
In the course of his remarks Mor
chus said that beautiful Carville would
soon become "another Barbary Coast"
if saloon licenses were freely allowed,
the beach being a favorite resort for
debauches.
"Through an oversight, owing to a
change in the office of secretary." ex

time the saloons are improperly con
ducted and you prove to ua that thÂ«y

Two of the women from Carville in
one breath asserted that all the saloons
were nuisances. They said disgraceful
scenes had been enacted within view
of their homes and there was serious
misgiving on their part for their chil
dren, from whom the disgraceful
sights could not bÂ«> screened.
But the delegation parted with thÂ«
commission with some degree of satis
faction, for the assurance was given
that the saloons would Â«ot be per
mitted to annoy the home-builders of
Carville or cause depreciation of prop
erty values.
Applications for renewal of licenses
were received from 147 saloons, 2

Special DiÃpatcb to The Call.
AUBURN. Feb. 15.â Adolph Weber,
accused of the murder of his mother,
Mary Weber, took the witness stand
t M-day in nis own defense. His man
ner during the direct examination by
.vttorney Johnson was mild and calm,
and his answers to the questions put
.<=â  attorney were given in an easy
ner. His attitude. however,
changed when the cross-examination
by Attorney General Webb began.
< General Webb conducted the cross-ex
amination'in a quiet and able man
ner. He put the question? to Adolph
In a voice that could be distinctly
h*ard throughout the big courtroom,
but the replies of the defendant were
jriven in an extremely low voice, at
times scarcely audible. Adolph's de
meanor and manner toward the At
torney General was at times aggres
often defiant. Weber was called
to the stand to-day for tie purpose of
refuting the statement made by Pawn
broker Carr of San Francisco, who
<1 aimed that he sold to Adolph the
j-tvo!ver found in the Weber barn.
Adolph declared that he had never
seen Henry Carr; had never been in
his shop in San Francisco and had
i>ever bought a revolver, blackjack or
trass knuckles from him.
When it became known that Adolph

dreds of persons rushed to the court
room. The place was packed to suf
focation. During the giving of the de
fendant's testimony a deathlike silence
pervaded the courtroom. Every ear
â¢ as strained to hear what Weber had
'.o cay.
Young Weber was called to the stand
at 120. The first question asksd by
Attorney Johnson was:
IÂ»id you ever see Henry Carr in San
Francisco?"
"1 did not." emphatically replied
Weber.
"Were you ever In his place of busi

Earl ? Did you set fire to your home
en the evening of November 10?"
"No, no, sir," answered Weber.
"Were they all alive when you left
the house?"
"They were."
"Did you rescue Earl from the
piano room?"
"I did."
The defendant then went on to say
that after he had milked the cow he
started out to take'a run for exercise,
going through the gate by the brewery
and from there across the little bridge,
up by Christopher Henney's house,
then up by the college, where for a
few moments he sat on the steps
at the entrance to the grounds. He
; then continued his course down
through College lane, by the James
heme, through the Courthouse yard,
down to Main street, and from there to
Cohen's store.
In reply to a query from Johnson,
j Weber declared he had not gone into
the American Hotel washroom before
the alarm of fire was sounded.
"Guy Lukens," said Weber, "met me
; on the street and told me my home
was ablaze. I ran up Brewery lane
and up the hill to the house. Adrian
Wills was the first person 1 saw there.
I went around the rear of the house,
and. after smashing the window in the
: dining-room, crawled into the room. I !
I irhaied a lot of smoke and I jumped
j out the way I had come in and rushed
around to the front porch. I don't
remember whom I saw there. I went
in through the front window. I took j
my brother to the window. I don't re- !
member who took him from me. I j
' was dazed. I don't know exactly what j
I did after that. I think I came down I
I the steps."
XEVER HAD WEAPON.
"What kind of overcoats did you |
i wear in San Francisco?" asked John
pon. "I wore a black one and a blue
one." said the defendant.
"Did you ever have a gray over
! coat?" "No." was the reply.
"Did you ever have a pistol, and do :
you know how the pistol found in the i
Weber barn got here?" "I do not," ;
answered Weber.
"Did you have anything to do with i
the murder of your family or the burn- j
ing of your home?' "No," said Weber ;
in a positive manner.
The defendant stated that his physi- ;
I cal condition was good, but that he
. v as nervous.
Here Attorney General Webb took !
up the crocs-examination. "Before I !
brgin the cross-examination I want to :
ask you if you have made all the state- j
ments you desire to make regarding i

i had made to the Sheriff the day after j
th<> fire, and also to the testimony he '
had given before the Coroner's jury. I
To the questions concerning these

defendant answered promptly and cm- j
phatically. On other matters, however. !
his memory was not aa good, "I don't I
j remember" or "I don't know" being
' quite frequently his response.
He said in reply to a question by
General Webb that after he had milked
the cow the evening of the fire he went '
back to the house. He could not tell
what the members of his family were
doinp when he arrived. He went up
stairs and lay down a short time, and
thrn started out for a walk. He could I
not tell General Webb what he had 1

done with the milk: he could not re
member how long he had laid upon the
bed. In reply to queries by General
Webb regarding what he did when he
got up from the bed and what time ho
came down to the kitchen Weber inva
riably answered, "I don't remember."
The defendant said he saw his father
when he came downstairs. He did not
speak to any member, of his family
after coming from milking.
"Where did you intend, to go when
you left the kitchen, when you were
going on the walk?" asked Webb.
"Anywhere I wanted to go," Mas the
flippant answer.
"Where were you going that even
ing?"
"Outside," snapped the witness.
"After leaving the house how soon
did you make up your mind which way
you wanted to go?
"When I got -up to the college steps I
thought I would go down town," said
Weber.
DESCRIBES JOURNEY.
The defendant described how, as he
was going- through the gate at the
brewery, he tripped and fell on the fire
plug, just outside the gate. He said the
fire plug had been there as lone as he
could remember.

"Where. did you hit the fire plug?"
"I tripped and fell on top of the fire

"How did you happen to fall?"
The defendant replied. "I was look

looking to see where the ; old fence
would strike the new one."
"Will you kindly stand up and show

Old Woman Is Believed to
Have Large Account in a

, NEW YORK, Feb. 15 âMary Ward,
"a little old woman known along the
j East River water | front for the * last
j thirty years as "Apple Mary" was ar
rested to-day on a charge of begging
with a basket of fruit on her ~ arm.
Search by the police. matron revealed
more than ,5100 in coins â¢ hidden in
some "small parcels in her clothing.
! Here : are some of the things found:
I $19 50 in pennies, $25 50 in nickels,
j $15 in ten cent pieces, $13 in quarters
; and $8 in bills so dirty that it took a
' long-time to decipher . their denomi

When the search began it was no
ticed : that Mary talked I with' an .im-
I pediment and when Captain Hodgkins
i questioned her closely she took several
! bills out of her mouth.
!Mary is believed to have; a large
I account-in a savings; bank. , She was
; held on a charge of vagrancy. -,
r Mary has been occupying a room on
! the top floor of a house in a squalid
j district. Every day, rain or \ shine,
j she is to "be seen" along ; the water
i front, selling her little store of fruit,
j which, the police say, is a subterfuge
i for begging pennies from sailors.
and well, and as you have stated,. when
you left the house to go for your
: walk, and you knew that they were
â¢ not in the habit of sittipg In the dining
room. You have just told us that your
sister Bertha was playing the piano
j in the piano room at the time; that
I your father was in the kitchen and
I that your mother was up stairs putting
â  your little brother to bed, and yet you
i went to the dining room window where
j you say there waB no fire and got into
i that room. Why did you do this?"
I "Because I wanted to get into the
i house," answered Weljer. "You did
I not expect to rind them in the dining
j room, did you'.'" "No," was the reply.
I "I went into the # dining room to
j rescue the family, but the smoke drove
1 me out."
"Where did you cut your hand?"
was Webb's next question.
"I don't remember," replied the wit
ness in a low voice. "When you were
coming up the front steps did you see
! a body coming out of the front win-
! dow? '
"Yes, I did" was the answer. "I
thought it was my mother's, but after
ward found out it was my sister's."
"You say you went in through the
windowâ where was your sister lying
I at the time you went in through the
window?" "She was lying on the porch
under the window when I went in."
"Did you step over or around her
body?" "I don't know."
"Do you pretend to tell me," said
Webb, dramatically raising his voice,
"that you could step over- the body of
j your dead sister and not know it?" "I
i don't know," came from Weber's lips.
The defendant said that he entered
the piano room for the purpose of
bringing out his brother and that he
brought him through the room to the
' window. He could not say what he
did after that up to the time he waa
: found sitting under the magnolia tree.
I He could not say who carried his little
! brother down the steps, but he knew he
i was alive when he picked him up in
the piano room and brought him to the
window.
ONLY SAW BROTHER.
"Did you go to your mother's side
[ and did you kneel down by your moth
' er's side and did you say to her,
| 'Mother, speak to me? No."
"Did you approach any of your fam-
I ily after they were brought from the
I house that night?" "I went up to my
brother in the yard."
General Webb then asked the de
fendant if he had not managed his trip
! from College Lane into the town proper
1 in such a manner as to make his testi
j mony conform with that of Walter
Crosby and Clarence Geear, whom he
met in front of Crosby's stable. "No,
I didn't," was the reply.
Attorney Johnson then took up the
defendant in redirect examination. He
confined himself to an effort to show
that the witness had no hand in the
death of his family or the burning of
the Weber home.
The principal witness at the morning
session was J. M. Francis. He stated
I that on the night of the tragedy he saw
I Mrs. Weber carried from the burning
home and laid on the grass. As he
looked at her he thought he saw her
lower lip quiver. He knelt down and
took her right hand, while Henry
; Bernhard rubbed her left hand. Fran
i cis said he placed his hand upon her
i head and, finding it still warm, called
for a doctor. He testified that now,
however, he was positive Mrs. Weber
was dead at that time and that the ap
parent quiver of her lips was but a
| shadow ca3t by the trees near by. Dur-
I ing Francis' recital Mrs. Snowden and
i Mrs. Hess, sisters of the murdered wo-
I man, burst into tears and sobbed con
| vulsively.
Attorney Johnson tried to introduce
a document signed by George Boyne,
secretary of the Board of Police Com
missioners of San Francisco, showing
that the license of Pawnbroker Carr
had been revoked April 19, 1904, and
| that Carr was, now selling goods with
out a license. It was not admitted.
Other witnesses examined to-day
were Elmer Coddington, Miss Theo
dora Wills, Miss Nellie Wills, Miss
Margaret Wills, W. F. Lanief, Mose J.
Predom and John Fulton.
The last witness called was H. E.
Kiessig, a gunsmith from Sacramento..
His evidence was introduced by the
defense to prove that bullets fired from
a pistol could not be recognized by the
[ marks on them. This evidence was
l Introduced to disprove the testimony
of Howard Carr. the San Francisco ex
} pert called by the prosecution. Kiessig
said he had fired ffour bullets through
the weapon found in the Weber barn
into a bunch of cotton. "I believe it
to be impossible," he said, "to deter
mine what kind of a gun the bullets
found in the Weber barn were fired
from."
Kiessig will go on the witness stand
again at 9 o'clock to-morrow morning,
when he will be cross-examined by the
prosecution.
There is a possibility that the wit
nesses for the defense may conclude
their testimony to-morrow night.

ST. PETERSBURG, Feb. 16. â Re
ports received here announce that
Vladivostok is being closely blockaded
by Admiral Uriu's fleet.
The departure of Admiral Neboga
toff's division of four battleships, one
cruiser and two auxiliary cruisers
from Libau yesterday to reinforce
Vice Admiral Rojestvensky's squadron
in the Far P^ast is a source of* grati
fication to the Admiralty, in view of
the difficulties caused by the strike.
The point of rendezvous with Rojest
vensky is not stated, but it is under
stood that it is beyond the Indian
Ocean, Vice Admiral Rojestvensky
being under instructions not to delay
into the monsoon period the resump
tion of his cruise.
Along the Hun River the booming
of heavy guns is sounding the over
tures of hostilities that are likely to
be opened within a short time. Press
dispatches Indicate that the cannon
ading is increasing in intensity.
Special dispatches from Mukden re
port the annihilation of an entire de
tachment of Japanese cavalry which
had destroyed a railway bridge be
tween Mukden and Harbin. Russian
cavalry overtook the raiders, who are
said to have refused quarter and
fought until the last man was killed.
Lieutenant General Sakharoff. Gen
eral Kuropatkin's chief of staff, tele
graphs that the Russian artillery on
February 13 destroyed the buildings
and walls of Nangazi, from which the
Japanese had been bombarding the
Russian trenches. The Japanese were
driven out.
In view of the continued attacks up
on and criticism of General Kuropat
kln, which are prejudicial to the Rus
sian arms, the Novoe Vremya, in an
extended defense of the tactics of the
commander-in-chief, proposes that a
commission composed of retired officers
be appointed to pass judgment upon
him.
MUKDEN, Feb. 15.â The Japanese
began heavy cannonading on Tuesday
afternoon on the Russian right flank
and the firing continued all through
to-day. It is believed the Japanese are
preparing for a general attack. The
Russian guns are replying.
FEUD OF RUSSIAN OFFICERS.
Late Defenders of Port Arthur De-
nounce One Another.
PARIS, Feb. 15.â French special cor
respondents sent to meet the French
steamship Australian, having on board
General Stoessel and others of the sur
vivors of Port Arthur, forwarded de
tailed accounts of discord among the
Russian officers. The army officers art
particularly hostile to the fleet, habitu
ally calling it the "frightened fleet."
Admiral Locklnsky, who was com
mander of the torpedo defenses at Port
Arthur,* is lengthily quoted as making
bitter criticism of General Stoessel, Ad
miral Alexieff and others. The Matin
quotes Lockinsky as characterizing
Vice Admiral Stark and Rear Admiral
Withoeft as "bedchamber admirals, not
acquainted with their duties and sea
sick whenever afloat."
The admiral added that Vice Admiral
Skrydloff prudently established himself
ashore at Vladivostok, notwithstanding
his opportunity to break the ineffective
blockade of Port Arthur. Lockinsky
declared he would denounce Stoessel,
Skrydloff and Alexieff before the court
martial.
The Petit Parisien quoted General
Stoessel as having sarcastically said:
"Rojestvensky had better not estab
lish a too secure base along the route,
or, like the naval officers at Port Ar
thur, it will be impossible to let them
venture seaward." The correspondent
of the Petit Parisien adds: "General
Stoessel cannot pardon the navy's fail
ure to succor him. while the navy fully
returns his hatred."

Whatever grounds may exist for the
charges that the Russians are violating
Chinese neutrality, it is certain that
bodies of Japanese troops and Chinese
bandits acting under Field Marshal
Oyama's orders are operating in Mon
golia, usually heavy detachments of
several hundred men. It was one of
such bodies which recently destroyed a
railroad bridge between Mukden and
Harbin.

committee in procuring the necessary
data to be embodied in the report that
will be submitted to the Historical So
ciety at its meeting to be held late in
the spring. Concerning the important
work that has been undertaken by the
organization Dr. Thompson said:
It Is not the object of the committee to
ascertain and criticize the methods used in
teaching, history, but to investigate how it is
taught, when and where) it is taught how
much of it is taught, the time devoted to its
study and the number of students in whose
'â r.urse of education It is included. Our field
of investigation will embrace Washington,
Oregon. California. Nevada. Arizona and Utah.
Wherever It is convenient members of our
committee will visit the larger cities .and ob
tain the required data from the school depart

the smaller towns and country schools and
vhen we have obtained all the information
desired we shall compile our report." Thfre
will be no recommendation made in the flrpt
report. We shall lay the facts before the

CAPITALIST LAWRENCE
STAYS IN CITY JAIL
OAKLAND, Feb. 15. â George E.
Lawrence, the Piedmont capitalist,
who was arrested last night after
stabbing his wife, it is charged, in the
face while he was intoxicated, appear
ed this morning in the Police Court to
answer to a charge" of drunkenness.
Lawrence pleaded guilty and was given
the usual sentence by Police Judge
George Samuels of '*$6 or three days."
Lawrence preferred to return to his
cell than to pay the fine. Mrs. Law
rence has not made a move toward
i prosecution of her husband. He has
been in the limelight because of much
domestic discord almost constantly for
months. Mrs. Lawrence caused his ar-
I rest several months ago for battery.
She followed that by suing for a di
vorce. That difficulty was adjusted,
but a second RUit was commenced by
the wife last week.
The colice have been advised that
Mrs. Lawrence will swear to a com
plaint against her husband as soon as
. she recovers from her injuries, which
are severe, but not necessarily fatal.
It is feared that the scars will mar
the wife's appearance the rest of her
life. Lawrence denies cutting his wife,
dfclaring she hit her face against the
telephone box during a family disturb
ance.
SUGGESTS NEW LAWS.
SACRAMENTO, Feb. 15.â The Wood
ward committee that is looking into
building and loan association methods
held another session to-night that
lasted until midnight. William Klinger
was before it as a complainant, saying
he had lost money with a company that
was insolvent when Secretary Fields
told him it was not so.
Clarence Grange of the Phoenix made
some more suggestions to the commit
tee. He declared against fining mem
bers. All associations of the larger
sort should be formed with a capital
of not less than JIOO,OOO, he said. In
smaller cities the capital could be
smaller like that of savings banks.
Grange said there should be two
building and loan commissioners and
that their salaries should be raised to
$3600 a year each and that of the sec
retary to $2400. If they did their duty
three men could devote all their time
to the work and find plenty to do.
C. J. Wade, secretary and manager
of the State Mutual Butlding and Loan
Asociation of Los Angeles, was called.
He represented the locals and while he
agreed generally with the statements
of Grange, he differed with him In some
particulars. He beileved in penalties
for stockholders.

BAND OF YAQUIS
Special Dispatch to The Call.
TUCSON, Ariz., Feb. 15.âAccord
ing to advices received to-night Gen
eral Torres and the four hundred men
of his command returned to La Col
orado Tuesday with 166 Yaqui war
riors, taken prisoners in a series of
fights with the savagea, which took
place on Sunday and Monday. The
Indians lost thirty killed and w^re
utterly routed. ,Less than a hundred
of the entire band of 359 braves es
caped. The Mexicans lost only two
killed, although their sick and wounded
will reach a large number.
The Yaquis were surrounded in the
hills between La Colorado and Ures, |
-where they remained inactive for al
most two weeks, but were finally com
pelled to give battle, forced into a
fight by hunge- and thirst. Almost
the entire band directed its efforts
toward breaking the Mexican lines at
a point guardec" by Captain Luis Bar
ron and a force wb^rh they far out- ;
numbered. They weft mowed down by
the rapid fire guns in the hands of the
Mexicans and finally forced to sur
render.
General Torres withdrew his force
from the hills to La Colorado, where \
tho prisoners were rounded up and
eight of the leaders executed. The i
Mexican force will be divided into
small garrfsons for the towns and
ranches and a detachment will pursue
the few surviving savages, but Torres
himself will no ' r take the field
in person.

READY TO HUNT
FOR NEW COACH
Varsity Men Decide Finally
Question of Director for
Their Football Team
TO HIRE PROFESSIONAL
Students' Executive Commit
tee Ratifies Agreement
Made With Kival College
Berkeley Office San Francisco Call,
214S Center Street, Feb. 15.
The question of professional coach
ing for the University of California's
football team is settled, so far as the
California institution is concerned, the
executive committee of the Associated
Students having ratified the action of
Its representatives, who conferred with
Stanford men recently regarding the
matter. The committee's action was
taken last night, following an exhaust
ive discussion of the questions at issue.
Colonel George C. Edwards, chairman
of the faculty committee on athletics,
continued to the last in opposition to
the professional coach idea, casting
his vote against ratifying the commit
tee's representatives' action when
working with the Stanford men.
Prominent among those who appear
ed at the meeting to argue in favor of
a professional coach was James A.
Force, captain of the varsity team.
Force urged the committee to ratify
the agreement, and do It at once, be
fore the available supply of Eastern
coaches is exhausted. Heitmuller and
Moffitt. members of the committee,
were absent. Their votes, however,
were not needed to insure ratification,
as the majority in tavor of such action
was decisive.
Work will be begun at once by Grad
uate Manager Decoto, acting for the
executive committee, to secure a coach
from the East. The names of Smith
of Columbia, Folsom of Dartmouth and
one or two others have been mentioned,
but there is no preponderance of favor
exhibited for any of thes*.
There will be an attempt made to
get ay. ay from the old Princeton style
of playing, however, and no coach who
represents Frineetonian methods is
likely to be considered. This feeling
is due to the belief that the university
has fallen into a rut by pursuing the
ideas which Garry Cochran inculcated
years ago, when those ideas represent
ed Princeton and were also up-to-date
ideas. The football game has changed,
however, and Cochran's game is ob
solete, say the gridiron sharps. Be
cause of this the university players
and football experts propose to take
a sharp turn in the opposite direction
and get a man who stands for some
thing in football coaching savoring of
other than Princetonian ideas.
The executive committee last night
set "Slarch 7 as the date when the
students shall vote on the proposed
plan for an undergraduate students'
affairs committee and a system of
pledges during: examinations.
The proposal from Utah for a
Thanksgiving game of football was re
jected.
The committee authorized a sub
oenffnittee to engage the Alhambra
Theater in San Francisco for April 15
for the intercollegiate debate with
Stanford.
GOOD SPEECHES
AND GOOD MEAL
Good cheer, good wine, good music
and good speeches were the features
of the Ad Club's banquet to the San
Francisco retailers at the St. Francis
last night. In the comfortable red
and gold banquet rooms of the hotel
the full quota of members of the club
and their invited guests were seated
around handsomely decorated tables
laden with choice viands. After the
repast many clever speeches apropos
of the occasion were made.
The toastmaster of this first social
meeting of "ad" man and retailer was
J. A. Johnston, vice president of the
club, and near him were seated the
speakers of the evening and Vice
President S. P. Johnston, Treasurer C.
H. House and Secretary S. M. Barrus.
Vice President E. M. Swasey sent a
telegram of congratulation and regret
for his inability to attend.
Following the introduction of Toast
mastor Johnston came the first speaker
of the evening, F. W. Dohrmann. He
spoke in happy terms of the purpose
oi the dinner and dwelt upon the value
of "confidence" â the confidence of the
public to insure success and then con
fidence in employes to obtain best re
sults. He compared the old conditions
of trade with the modern, and closed
by appealing to all to U9e fairness,
flrmr.ess and hindnets in their busi
ness dealings.
S. P. Johnston, the next speaker,
chose for his subject "Quality vs.
Price." in which he. insisted that the
best trade came to the firms who in
sisted in selling the best quality rather
than in cutting the price on cheap
goods.
R. C. Ayres followed with a clever
description of the kind of advertising
that interests men. He spoke of th-e
necessity of education in advertising
and the necessity for the advertiser to
appeal to the mind through word and
pen pictures.
The other speakers were: Homer
Boushey. on the kind of advertising
that interests women; Henry G. Long
hurst, on '"How to Interest the Entire
Family"; George Chase, on 'Store Ser
vice and Advertising"; Benjamin
Weed, on "Results From Small Appro
priations"; J. Francis Smith, on "Suc
cess Through Advertising"; Max Som
mers, on "Shoe Advertising"; R. E.
Miller. "Aggressive Advertising"; C.
H. House, on "Advertising as Seen by
tne Newspaper," and F. J. Cooper, on
"Profitable Advertising."
WOULD STOP NEPOTISM.
SACRAMENTO, Feb. 15.â Two bills,

wife, brother, sister, son or daughter
to office under him.

WOMEN VICTIMS
OF MISCREANT
A "Joker," whose identity the United
States mail authorities are eagerly try
ing to establish, found Valentine's day
an excellent opportunity to exhibit his
malicious tendencies, and as a result a
guest of the Grand Hotel and several
ladies of the Palace are now slowly re
covering from an unpleasant experi
ence, and one that might have proved
quite serious had the victims not re
ceived prompt attention.
On Tuesday there was received at the
Palace Hotel in its regular big bunch
of mail a letter addressed to Mrs. E. L.
Gray of Illinois, who happens to be
staying at the Grand Hotel. In segre
gating the mail Clerk Gately of the
Palace noticed a strong odor attached
to the envelop bearing Mrs. Gray's
address, but supposed that the missive
had contracted the obnoxious odor by
contact with some foreign matter, and
without further investigation he for
warded It to the Grand Hotel. When
Mrs. Gray received the letter in her
room and opened it the envelope emit
ted an awful stench, that nearly suf
focated the lady. The room rapidly
filled with gas. and it was with consid
erable difficulty that Mrs. Gray was
able to reach the door of her apartment
and summon assistance before she col
lapsed.
The management of the Grand was
immediately notified^ and proceeded to
subject Mrs. Gray's apartment to a
thorough fumigation, while its weak
and nauseated occupant was being
cared for by the hotel attendants.
A little later Mrs. J. W. Neill and
Miss Virginia Neill, two recent arrivols
from Tonopah, met witl> an experience
similar to that of Mrs. Gray in their
rooms at the Palace. Fortunately the
ladies threw the odoriferous letters out
of a window before the sickening gas
that their mysterious contents devel
oped had time to permeate the atmos
phere of the room.
Yesterday the postoffice inspectors
were notified by the hotel managers of
the dastardly work of the unknown
miscreant, and an investigation is now
in progress with a view of tracing the
letters to their sender and causing his
arÂ«est. Should the culprit be found he
will be made to realize that his sup
posed joke is a serious offense and is
likely to land him in the State prison.
Nearly all of the mail of the two hotels
that Included the letters addressed to
the *omen mentioned contracted the
odor and had to be destroyed by the re
cipients.

Cardinal Speaks of Lasting
Victories Won by Apostles
Without Sword or Cannon
I CINCINNATI, Feb. With the
simple and impressive service of the
j Roman Catholic church, the full pow
ers of an Archbishop were conferred to
! day on Henry Moeller. a native of Cmi
i cinnati, who for over ten years was
I coadjutor for this archdiocese. Car
dinal Gibbons, Archbishop Glennon of
| St. Louis and a number of Bishops were
i in attendance. The sermon was
preached by Cardinal Gibbons. He said
| in part:
What a â¢ contrast presents Â» Itself to our
minds between the peaceful . conquests of thÂ»
apostles and their successors on the one hand
and the bloody victories achieved by the great
generals of antiquity en thÂ« other. . whether
we consider the weapons - with which -they
fought, the battles they won or th- duration
of their victories. Alexander the Great* who
may be considered one of the greatest generals
of ancient â¢ times, subdued nation* by wading
1 through . the blood of â  his fellow, beings. By
the- sword he- 'conquered and by the sword he
kept his subjects in bondage. B. scarcely
was he â  consigned to his grave when his em
pire was dismembered ana his subjects shook
off the yoke which had been imposed on them.
' The , apostles conquered kingdoms for "their
Divine Master not by force, but by persuasion ;
not by the â  material sword. - but by the sword
of the spirit. - which is the word of God; not
by shedding < the blood of others, but by thÂ»
voluntary shedding of their own blood; not
by enslaving the .bodies of, men, but by res
cuing their souls >â¢ from the - bondage" of , sin.
And the spiritual republic - which they, founded
exists unto this day, la constantly* extending
Us lines and Is kept together not by frown-
Ing fortifications and standing armies, but by
the divine influence of religious and;' moral
sanctions. ' '
What does this prove? It prove* that thÂ«
pen and the voice are mightier tban the sword :
it proves that "peace hath her victories no less
renowned than war." aye, victories more sub
stantial and enduring. It proves that all
schemes conceived In passion and fomented
by â¢ lawless ambition are doomed, like the
mountain torrent, to carry terror before them
and â¢to leave ruin and ' deasolatlen after them,
while i the actions iof men laboring under the
inspiration of heaven are destined, like the
gentle dew of heaven, to shed silent blessing*
around them and to bring forth abundant
fruit in due season.

KN HIM I>AST EVENING AT THE UNION LEAGUE CLUB.
United States Senator-elect Frank I
P. Flint was the guest of honor at
the Union League Club last evening
and gained much commendation for his
sensible utterances and genial, digni
lied bearing.
Shortly before 9 o'clock he was es
corted from the Palace Hotel to the
club by a committee consisting of Sam
uel J. Hendy, Joseph Spear and Edgar
Peixctto. When he entered the beau
tifully lighted and cozily furnished re

*vas welcomed by rounds of cordial
applause from the* large throng of rep
resentative men there assembled.
The ceremony of introduction was
happily performed by Colonel George
'i. Pippy. president of the league, who
pro Acted that the new Senator would
ably represent California in the Sen
ate of the United States.
In response the Senator-elect ex
pressed his gratitude for the warmth
â¢>' the reception given to him. He
of the greatness and grandeur
Â»>f San Francisco, observing that he
ii'.ver visited the city without noting
pome new element of prosperity and
greatness. What caused the greatest
surprise was the fact that the citizens
of San Francisco themselves seldom
spoke of the marvelous growth and
Â«lev<?lopment of the city. On this theme
he said:
You jolly v'u ' .of th* south for booming Los

PROID OF CALIFORNIA.
Colonel Pippy spoke of his recent
visit to Washington. D. C, and men
tioned Incidentally that the President
was proud of California. In view
of the recent tremendous majority
which California gave to the Repub
lican cause Colonel Pippy deemed it
consistent to 'introduce as the next
speaker Colonel George Stone, chair
man of the Republican State Commit
tee.
When the applause subsided Colonel
Stone spoke of the able representa
of California in the United
States Senate from the time of Fre
mont and Gwin until the days of
Perkins and Flint. He believed the
State had reason to be proud of all of
tiie twenty-two Senators. He con
gratulated the Republican party and
the peoole of the State on the choice
of a man from the south for Senator,
and noted that the retiring Senator
Map from the south. He thought it
fitting and proper in view of the di
versified interests of California and
the long stretch of seaboard that one
of the Senators should hail frohi
Southern California. He was con
vinced, however, that both Senators
and the Representatives in thÂ°e other
House of Congress would work for
the common advancement of the
whole State without regard to sec
tional lines or geographical limits.
He closed by wishing Senator Flint
every measure of success in his high
station.
Congressman-elect Julius Kahn of
the Fourth District was the next
speaker* introduced. He remarked
that every one that served In Con
gress was impressed by the spirit of
absolute fairness in both houses. The
word of a member is accepted as
truth. If a man makes a misstate
ment good-by to his influence. On
this topic he said:
Th* State of California, is one of the sec
tions to conjure with. Members are senerally
Â»il!lng to accede to our demands. Many Con
gressmen have vlelted this State and others
hope to come. Personal Inspection. I have
noted, la more effective than verbal argument.
I am cure that our delegation will work in
harmony for the advancement of our true
interests. Let me express the hope that our
win follow the example of Eastern
and retain in the Senate men of proved
ability.
DUNCAN E. McKINLAY.
Duncan E. McKinlay, Congressman
eW t. Second District, was the next
speaker and the reception accorded to
him, like that given to Mr. Kahn, was
exceedingly cordial. Mr. McKinlay
deemed himself especially fortunate
that he had been for several days the
associate <>f the new Senator in visit
inc the prrat valley of the Sacramento
and on fjps t<j Mare Island navy yard
ami Oakland harbor. McKinlay spoke
stly and intelligently on subjects
relating to reclamation of submerged
land? of the great valley. He insisted
that reclamation was the great prob
lem of California . and should engage
the consideration o-f the tax-paying
citizTi.s of the State. He mentioned
that property to the value of ten mil
lion dollars had been destroyed by the
Edward? break in the Sacramento
levee. Engineers of eminence, experts
in their profession, had presented a
plan of reclamation, but the complete
execution of the system would require
an expenditure of $24,000,000. It was
designed that the State should shoul
der $8,000,000 of the expense, the owners
of reclaimed lands $8,000,000 and the
United States Government $8,000,000.
The plan when carried out would add
the value of 100,000,000 acres of land to
the taxable wealth of the State. He
said:
Merchants may cay, "We are opposed to
higher taxation." but they should count the
loeses which come by floods sweeping over
the valley. ThÂ« reclamation of the Sacra
mento River will be a potential agency in
lifting up Ean Francisco. ThÂ« problem la on*
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 16, 1905.
that demands earnest consideration of every i
member Of Congress and every citizen of Cal- j
Ifornia. The ivork now advanced should be 'â 
pressed forward.
Mr. McKinlay also spoke of the i
necessity of appropriations for Mare i
Island and the need of money to deepen '
the channels leading to San Rafael,
Petaluma and Napa.
SHORTR^DGE EMBARRASSED.
The speechmaking closed v. - ith a few
polished sentences from Samuel M.
Shortridge. He pleaded a little embar
rassment in the presence of so many
statesmen, but overcame his bashful
ness as he progressed with his re
marks. He spoke of Senator-elect
Flint as a man clean of hand, clean of
heart and high of purpose, who realized
the gTeat responsibility placed upon
him. He predicted that the new Sen
ator would reflect honor on himself
and confer distinction on the State.
Handshaking' followed the speech
making. Among those who greeted the
new Senator were:

battleship Ohio. Paymaster Karr. TT. S. N\:

BEALL OPPOSES
NAVAL INCREASE
Texan Declares the Country
Has Gone Mad Over the
Spirit of Militarism
WASHINGTON, Feb. 10.-The ques
tion of what the policy of the Govern
ment should bo with respect to the
upbuilding of the navy was again
threshed out in the House to-day dur
ing the consideration of the naval ap
propriation bill, the debate developing
much opposition to the proposed addi
tion of two battleships to the naval
establishment.
Beall of Texas, in opposing large ap
propriations for the army and navy,
declared that the United States had
gone mad over the spirit of militarism,
which was sapping the substance of
the people. The Government was pay
ing as much attention to "ceremonies,
pomp and power" as any Government
on earth, and he said it was the most
extravagant Government in the world.
He compared the heavy army and
navy expenditures of this country
with those of other nations, and, in re
ferring to Russia, said that she spent
more, "but Russia is a despot, a Gov
ernment hated by its own people and
despised by the people of the world,"
and that she maintained her existence
by the power of her arms.
Beall referred to the President's
speech in New York on Monday night,
in which it was maintained that while
the United States should at all times
cultivate friendly relations with other
people and talk pleasantly to them,
the upbuilding of the navy must go on.
There was never a nation that played
the bully among other nations of the
world, Beall remarked in that connec
tion, that there was not some other na
lion ready to engage in a death strug
gle with it, -and he predicted "history
would repeat itself with us."

WARRING HOUSEWIVES ENTERTAIN
COURT OF JUDGE CABANISS
ONE OF THEM SHOCKS
PROFANELY REGRETS OLD AGE
OF THE COMPLAINING MATRON
JAMES C. CRAWFORD
There was nothing in the testimony
to indicate just when and why the
friendship between Mrs. Delia Kane
and Mrs. Stephen Sweetman gave way
to mutual dfsesteem. All that Police
Judge Cabaniss learned or attempted to
ascertain concerning the severance of
their neighborly relationship consisted
in the disclosure that one day they
abruptly ceased borrowing household
necessaries from each other and there f
after were as far apart in thought and
deed as they formerly had been close
together. As they and their respective
families jointly occupied the flat at 1614
Twentieth street it was absolutely im
possible for them to avoid meeting In
the hallway, but on such occasions it
was the effort of each to appear utterly
oblivious of the other's being. By tacit
understanding the common corridor
was divided by an imaginary line,
which both ladies respected until the
eventful day when Mrs. Sweetman had
Mrs. Kane arrested on the charge of
having disturbed the peace.
From the statements of principals
and witnesses It appeared that Mrs.
Kane was scrubbing: her section of the
hallway when, either willfully or inad
vertently, she trespassed upon the en
emy's territory and was sharply repri
manded by Mrs. Sweetman. From that
point the testimony was apparently
prompted by the predilection of the de
ponent. Mrs. Kane's witnesses swore
that the unprintable language was
monopolized by Mrs. Sweetman, while
Mrs. Sweetman's w itnesses as positive
ly averred that all the foul utterances
were delivered by Mrs. Kane. The
Kane contingent alleged that Mrs.
Sweetman cast aspersions upon the
Celtic race in general and Mrs. Kane
in particular, and the Sweetman ad
herents asseverated that the manner ln
which Mrs. Kane traduced the Fader
land, of which Mrs. Sweetman is a
daughter, was frightful to hear.
"From which it can only be inferred,"
remarked the Judge when the te^- ;
mony was all in. ""that each lady gave I
as much as she received in the way of
oral castigation." ' r-A'
"I don't know what you mean by
! that,", said Mrs. Kane, "but if she
hadn't ha' been so old I'd ha* broken
her â d neck."
"Tut, tut!" exclaimed the court, pal
pably shocked. "Remember where you
â¢ are, . madam, and modify your adjec
tives." ; . , *â 
I "I wish you had a matron here," was
Mrs. Kane's irrelevant response.
"Why?" Inquired his Honor.
"So that I could, show her and she
could tell you what that little -Dutch
woman did to me with an ax." . . .
"I'll forego the pain of receiving such
enlightenment and continue this case
thirty days," said the Judge.
. * > â¢ *
. J. J. Beauregard denied the charge
of Patrolman Louis Nye that he sold
bee*r for consumption on' his premises,
Greenwich street. within the pro
scribed territory' contiguous to the
Presidio, inasmuch as the beer which
Ihe sold was â¢â¢ in a } can, commonly
i called a v "growler," and was carried
from his premises to an adjoining lot,
where it was drunk by various sol
diers and civilians, the latter being
carpenters employed in the construc
tion of a ; residence on ' said lot. V The
policeman, : however, contended . that
the scene of guzzling was attached .to
Mr. Beauregard's place of business
and therefore technically a portion of
his '- premises. To which the defense
retorted that the Farallones might as
reasonably be designated a portion of
the â  Beauregard premises, because Mr.
Beauregard '. had , Just as : much title :to
those islands as , to the waste y place
whereon the beer was consumed.
Judge Mogan and several lawyers
have called for ; maps and property,
records and i other things to aid them
in deciding whether Mr. Beauregard
or his accuser is in the right.

ing to overhear something that he
might utilize as a medium of levying

bin also expressed opinion that Mr.
Betts, whom they had arrested and
booked for vagrancy, was a '"Peeping
Tom" and Judge Mogan gave them
until next Tuesday to find out more
about the defendant's past.
"It's 'ard, sir, cruel 'ard," said Wil
liam Robb, late of London, when
Judge Mogan sentenced him to twen
ty-four hours' imprisonment for hav
ing obtained $1 50 by false pretense
from a philanthropic transplanted
Briton.
It might be worse," his Honor ob
served.
â¢'So it might, sir. so it might," Mr.
Robb agreed, "an' I hain't cornplainin'
abeout wot you've 'anded me. Wot I
means ter saiy, sir. is that it's bloo*m
in' 'ard ter be wrongfully accused."
"You would better get away from,
this country, for you seem incapable
ot thriving in it," the Judge remarked.
"Never fear, sir, never fear. Just
as soon as I've done this little bit in
the jug I'll 'asten to Haustralia."
"May you find society over there
more to your liking," said the court.
"Thanky, sir; thanky 'eartily," Mr.
Robb responded.
Seventeen-year-old Joe Tobin Indig
nantly denied he was a vagrant and
conclusively proved that his arrest and
befoking for vagrancy was a blunder,
inasmuch as he dwelt with his parents
and worked every day for his liveli
hood. So he was dismissed by Judge
Mogan, who remarked that the little
chap's indignation was justifiable.
Joe was returning from a theater to
his home last Tuesday evening and
while awaiting a car at Ninth and Bry
ant streets he reclined in an empty
wagon and fell asleep. That was where
Patrolman J. Moran found him.
Attorney Percy E. Towne disclaims
obligation to the court official who,
either unintentionally or mischievously,
had his baptismal name published as
that of J: E. Towne, a bartender, who
was robbed and brutally beaten by
Robert Coronel on the Barbary Coast,
for which crime Mr. Coronel is held for
trial in the Superior Court.
J. Sigota, accused of smiting Peter
Mosteriga's head with a cribbage board,
a chair and several other impromptu
weapons, avers there was money at
stake in the card game in which the
row originated, but the proprietor of
the saloon at Pacific and Stockton
streets, in which the game was played,
flatly contradicts Signor Sigota's aver
ment, and declares the honor of win
ning was all that the players contended
for. Signor Sigota. however, obstinately
maintains that not only was United
State^*currency the bone of contention,
but that the upsetting of the table
dumped the coins upon the floor, where
they were scrambled for, obtained and
kept by persons who were not at all
entitled to possess them.
Signor Mosteriga corroborates the sa
loonist's allegation anent the absence of
cash and- pride of conquest being the
only prize attainable. Cribbage was
the game. Signor Mosteriga says, and
he and Signor Sigota were rivals for
the Latin quarter championship, the
latter gentleman being intrusted with
the task of tallying the points made by
both. In the course of marking Signor
Sigota pave Signor Mosteriga only
15-2-15-4. whereas Signor Mosteriga had
scored and was entitled to be credited
with 15-2-15-6. A mild remonstrance
from Signor Mosteriga provoked Signor
Sicnta to commit battery with the
marking board, and subsequently with
taliated In kind further than to attempt
self-defense.
Judge Mogan has set next Saturday
morning as the time for hearing further
testimony.
Richard and Mary L.ance, who gave
their residence as the Grand Hotel,
were arrested for drunkenness Tuesday
afternoon on Hayes street, and when
they failed to appear for trial before
Judge Mogan he forfeited their bail
and ordered a bench warrant issued
for their production in court to-morrow.

TRAVELS FAR
TO WED LOVER
English Maid Pawns Her
Jewels and Gives Up Her
Home for Man of Choice
Special Dispatch to Th* Call.
FRESNO, Feb. 15.â The love of Miss
Bertha Burman was true for eight, long
years. To prove It she pawned her
jewels and traveled from Sheffield,
England, to Fresno to wed her old
sweetheart, Richard Gardiner, a plum
ber. '
Gardiner left England to reap a har
vest in this country, for Papa Burman
would not intrust his daughter to a
man without means. Bertha tired of
waiting and as they had some money
in the bank she did not think the
wealth of her father worth waiting for.
She did not even wait for Gardiner to
send money for a ticket, but pawned
her jewelry and crossed the ocean. She
arrived yesterday and now they are
happily settled in a cozy home.
DIMOXD FILES BRIEF

WASHINGTON, Feb. 15.â A brief
in behalf of Henry P. Dimond of Cal
ifornia in his habeas corpus case
against United States Marshal Shine
of that State was filed in the Supreme
Court of the United States to-day.
Dimond is one of the men indicted for
conspiracy to defraud the Government
in connection with the land frauds.
Judge de Haven of San Francisco
issued, a warrant for his removal to
this city and denied a petition for a
writ of habeas corpus. Dimond sets
up in his brief that Judge Lacombe
of New York granted a writ to John
A. Benson under precisely similar cir
cumstances and also contends that
the Washington court is without juris
diction.

GETS REPRIEVE
Murderess and Her Compan

To-Day, as Was Planned
STILL HOPE FOR LIFFI
Cases of the Woman and the
Negro Will Again Come
l : p in Pennsylvania Court
HARRISBURG. Pa.. Feb. 15.â 0n the
recommendation of the Board of Par
dons to-day, Governor Pennypacker
withdrew the death warrants in the
cases of Mrs. Kate Edwards, the white
woman, and SamuÂ«l Greason. the
negro, who were under sentence to
hang; together at Reading to-morrow
for the murder of Mrs. Edwards' hus
band in 1901. The case of Greason will
once again be taken to the Pennsyl
vania Supreme Court and it that
tribunal refuses to reopen the *case,
the attorneys for Mrs. Edwards and
Greason will have to appear before the
Board of Pardons next month.
The reason for the board's action was
read by the Attorney General. It is as
follows:
In view of tbe dissent on thÂ» part of throa
Justices of th* Supreme Court from thÂ» opin
ion of the court in refusing the peti'
Samuel Greason for an order authorizing a
new trial, and in view of the statement of
counsel for Greason that there arÂ» foi,
nesses never before examined whose deposi
tions they desire to take and present to tIM
Supreme Court for its consideration, '-
plication for a continuance in the Edwards
i ase 13 granted, and the application for t
rehearing in the Greaaon case is granted.
READING, Pa.. Feb. 15.â When the
news of the rehearing in the Greason
case and a continuance for Mrs. Ed
wards was sent to the jail Mrs. Ed
wards was lying on her cot, moaning
and sobbing.
It was explaine . â¢> her that she nail
at lea3t been granted a new lease of
life. It was a long time before she
could be made to realize that sho
would not have to hang to-morrou
She said that it appeared to her that
her life was only spared to prolong her
misery. She apparently realizes that
shÂ£ was only saved from the gallon*
to enable her to testify in favor â !
Greason.
After she had become more comoosed
M"<. Edwards said: "Thank God. you
| could not have brought me better new^.
I know that I've done a great wrong,
but I'm not- such a bad woman at
rwart. I thank God again and I thank
all my friend 3."
Greason when told otf the board's de
cision, said: "I knew it could not be
otherwise."

Johnny Schorr's useful four-year-old
Ananias, shouldering 110 pounds and
ridden by Birkcnruth, defeated the
crack mare Honiton for the $1000 mile
nd one-hundred yard handicap yes
terday at OalUand. At the same time
the chestnut horse chopped off a second
from the track record of 3-4,
which he hung up only a few weeks
ago.
Honiton took a handicap on Tuesday
in easy fashion and, though asked to
pick up 122 pounds yesterday, "Packy"
liyan thought her equal to the task.
Coupled with San Nicholas, the odds
against the pair were shied from 6 10
Â£ to 4 to 5.
San Nicholas was sent out to kill off
Ananias and the black led the Schorr
horse to the far urn, where he ran
out of ammunition. Ananias then
assumed command. Minder astride,
Honiton after him with a wet sail. A
furlong from the stand it looked as if
the mare might win. but she hung, and,
drawing away, Ananias won ridden
cut by a couple of lengths in 1:44 3-4.
The light weighted Nigrette ran a good
third. W. R. Condon pulled up lame,
and Bragg was outclassed.
The card wore a fetching look and
drew a large attendance. Mountebank
was the only favorite to come through.
In such high esteem was the Jen
nings duo. Ruby and Princess Wheeler,
held In the speculating on the opening
live and a half furlong run that 2 to
5 was the closing price. Ruby tried to
run out on the turns and when Knapp
began taking liberties with her at the
end got nabbed a nose on the wire by
Maid of Fermoy, a 30 to 1 shot. Merin
gue, a 40 to 1 chance, downed Princess
Wheeler for the show.
Wright followed this up by landing
fcterling. Towers tirst for the Futurity
ooune eprint, following. The mare's
odds fell from threes to 13 to 5, and in
a drive she received a neck decision
over the 2 to 1 favorite Toupee, piloted
by Larsen. Harry Michaels finished
third on Urbano. a lightly backed out
eider. Prince Magnet, a 100 to 1 shot,
led the field into the stretch.
A carload of coin was dumped into
the ring on Mountebank to win the
t-even-*furlong selling affair, which the
Keating gelding did. If Michaels had
devoted one-half as much energy on
his mount. Suburban Queen, as he did
to taking care of Bab, the result might
have been different.
Jakie Jones rode the latter mare, and
in the form he is exhibiting in the sad
dle could get Hermis beaten for the
Yakima Derby. Minder went out in the
lead with Mountebank, and in a so
called drive disposed of Suburban
<jueen by less than a length. The odds
about Bab went from 3 to 5, and after
a refreshing going over she dropped in
third.
So frenzied was the state of the mar
ket during business hours on the mile
celling event that it was difficult to dis
tinguish the favorite, at post time.
Whoa Bill probably had the rail,
though not because of support tendered.
Mindanao opened up the choice, but
\\ hen the Ebony and Hugh McGowan
money floated to the surface the price
about Bob Smith's horse went soaring
to 3*s. The three horses named reached
ihe wire heads apart, Larsen astride
Mindanao receiving the verdict over
Kbony through outriding Bell. Hugh
McGowan looked a winner at the
paddock.
Billy Cabin's colt Tada captured the
final mile purse for three-year-olds. Al
though Ara was installed favorite, the
Fmart money went in on Yada, and he
won easily from Fisher Boy, a 60 to 1
outsider. Jakie Jones on Ara lost the
rtow to True Wing.

has done me in a case of Contagious Blood
Poison. Among other symptoms I was se-
verely afflicted with Rheumatism, and got
almost past going. The disease got a firm
hold upon my system; my blood was thor-
oughly poisoned with the virus. I lost in
weight, was run down, had sore throat,
eruptions, splotches and other evidences
of the disease. I was truly in a bad shape
when I began the use of S. S. S., but the
persistent use of it brought me out of my
trouble safe and sound, and I have the
courage to publicly testify to the virtues of
your great blood remedy, S. S. S., and to
recommend it to all blood-poison suffer-
ers, sincerely believing if it is taken ac-
cording to directions, and given a fair
trial, it will thoroughly eliminate every
particle of the virus. James Curraxt,

OARSMEN SEEK
A NEW COURSE
Stanford Declines to Row
on the Estuary Owing
to Roughness of the Water
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Feb. 15.
Tlie interoollepiate regatta between
Stanford, the University of California
and the University of Washington will
nut be held on the Oakland estuary
this year. This is the decision of those
who have the interests of Stanford in
charge. The Stanford crews are com
pelled to practice on comparatively
smooth water, and they maintain that
to row the great race on the rough
â water of the Oakland estuary will put
them under too great a disadvantage.
A: a result of this decision a new
course is being looked for. The most
desirable waterway seems to be at
Stockton, where there is a long, wide
plough, filled with comparatively
smooth water. There is also a road
nionÂ« the slough, which would enable
sightseers in vehicles to view the race
from start to finish. The course is wide
enough to permit the use of launches
tot judges, college rooters and spec
tators. The only difliculty with the
Stockton proposal Js that it is so far
from the two universities that it would
be impossible for many students to
witness the regatta.
While at Stockton investigating the
\\at<-r courses Manager Barrett of Stan
ford examined two four-oared boats
with a view to purchasing them. There
are at present more than fifty men
who are trying for the cardinal crew,
and the two practice boats on hand
are not sufficient to accommodate all
the men. With four practice barges
and the new racing shell which recent
ly arrived from Cornell University, the
Stanford rowing candidates will have
ample means for becoming expert oars
men.

J. hn Uwson. l. McCreery!
Both ponies and players are in great
form at present, having taken part in
six games during the week they spent
at Del Monte. This game is expected
to furnish a line as to the relative
strength of the visitors and the Bur
lingame men for the big match with
which the season is closed annually.
In this game Mr. Mackey will replace
Mr. Lawson on the English team.
The public is always made welcome
at these games, stands being placed at
the disposal of spectators, from which
they can note every move of the horse
men in the exciting play. The electric
cars of the San Mateo line pass the
farm, which Is also accessible by the
railroad. The game will be called at
3 o'clock on Sunday.

IX A RACIAL CONFLICT
Being an Account of How one Teuton
Is Alleged to Have Whipped
Seven Sons of Hrin.
NEW YORK, Feb. 14.â "though he is
a little fellow, John J. Reister, a Ger
man, bested seven Irishmen on a Third
avenue down town car this mornfnjr.
Reister was going down town with his
crippled brother, Julius. When he at
tempted to stop the car so the brother
could alight, the conductor started in
to beat Reister. A bystander named
Roch interfered and called the crippled
brother a vile name. The motorman,
Michael Callahan, took sides with the
conductor.
Reister, fighting for the honor of his
brother, sailed through all who offered
resistance. The number against' him
was seven, all sons of Erin. Reister
and Roch were arrested.
NELSON STILL
HIGH IN FLESH
Dane Finds It Difficult
to Get Below 140
Pounds at This Time
DATE FINALLY NAMED
Rival Lightweights Will
Don the Gloves on the
Last Day. of the Month
The date of the Corbett-Nelson fight
has finally been selected by the officials
of the Hayes Valley Athletic Club.
The two lightweights will meet In
Woodward's Pavalion on the last day
of this month. Nelson is still over
weight, but once the flesh commences
to come off it will not take long for
him to reach the 130-pound mark.
He is working like a beaver at
Smiling Metzner's tavern. Larkspur.
The Dane has conditioned himself at
Larkspur for his last four fights, and
he thinks Marin County is the only
place to train. Heretofore he has had
an easy time, but on this occasion he
seems to stick at the 140-pound mark.
Much hard road work has ' been in
dulged in, but the surplus flesh is slow
in disappearing. \ â  "
The question of making 130 pounds
does not seem to worry Bat, however,
and ho promises to be under the notch
when he ' mounts the scales on the
28th.
He is the picture of health, but looks
rather heavy. He is still a glutton for
work and hardly rests a minute. Yes
terday morning he hit the road for
twelve miles and after a brisk rub
down took a walk in Baltimore canyon.
In the afternoon more than an hour
was spent In the gymnasium. He did
his usual stunts, wrestled with Raw
hide Kelly and boxed five fast rounds
each with Fred Landers and Bill Ben
ner. A large crowd was on hand to
watch him perform. \ â¢
Young Corbett is gradually rounding
Into form at Billy Shannon's villa
under the watchful eyes of Trainer
Frank McDonald."
The little fellow has been steadily
grinding for nearly two months, and
his present condition is a just reward
for his hard labor. Plenty of road
work, boxing, plain food and regular
hours have seemingly brought back
the Young Corbett of old. He has clear
eyes, a healthy glow of the skin and a
strong desire to work. Corbett, like
Frankie Neil, is continually on the g >.
and Frank McDonald has lost weight
worrying for fear some accident may
befall his protege.
Since Joe Gans* arrival at the camp
Corbet! has been kept busy in the
gymnasium, as the dusky champion
loves to don the mits.
Joe is taller than Corbett and has a
longer reach,' but the little fellow
wades in and the pair box many hard
rounds. . /
Corbett changed his programme yes
terday. ' indulging only in road work.
Ten miles over the hills constituted his
day's work. To-day boxing will be re
newed. Corbett is said to weigh about
131 pounds. He expects to touch 128
pounds some time during his training .
CASEY EXPECTS TO WIX.
After Pofeatiin? Sam Berjrcr He As
pires to Meet Johnson.
Some time ago Jim Casey. wh'> fight 9
Sam Berser at Woodward's Pavilion
to-morrow night, vas acting as spar
ring partner for Bob Fitzsimmons. At
that time thf bis: frfnhman'ii knowledge
nf the same was limited to wild swing-
Ing and an awkward style of footwork.
Fitz is a keen judge of lighting ma
terial, and though Casey was raw as a
farmer OM Bob predicted a bright
future fÂ«>r him. "Keep your eyes on
that Irishman. " Fitz remarked. "He's
quick to learn, and mark my words,
he'll be at the top some day."
How well Bob's prophecy will come
true the sports will learn to-morrow
evening. There is no gainsaying th<?
fact Casey has developed from an awk.

City Attorney to Advise if
Supervisors Have Power to
Grant Santa Fe Petition
PEOTESTS AEE HEARD
Property Owners Want Com
pany to Kemunerate Them
for Damages to Interests
The Supervisors 1 Street Committee
yesterday considered the protests of
Annie Toomey, the Lehrcke Company.
P. J. Tiernan and others against the
proposed grant of a franchise to the
Santa Fe Railway Company for a
right of way along Sixteenth, Mari
posa. Indiana and other streets to
connect with its main system. The
ordinance granting the franchise waa
passed to print, but the opposition has
blocked its final passage.
The roint was raised that as the !
Board of Supervisors had already j
granted in 1901 a franchise to the cor- ;
poration to enter this city it has no ;
legal right to grant a second fran- j
chise of a similar character. Cap- >
tain A. H. Payson submitted a pri- |
vate legal opinion to the effect that !
the board has the power to grant the
privilege for what he termed an "In
dustrial" track to connect the main
system with the various industries in
the Potrero. The protestants claimed j
that the opinion of the City Attor
ney was the only one of legal value.
Payson admitted this, but said h}s
company would be willing to defend
the franchise in the courts if it were J
granted.
Tiernan's attorney said his client's
property on Eighteenth street would
be damaged to the extent of $4000,
but no offer of a settlement had ever
been made by the railroad company.
M. Mellin said his cHent's prop
erty would be damaged by $2000, but
the company had offered but $400,
and he would contest the right of the
board to grant the franchise if his
client's claim is not settled. The
committee ended the discussion by re- |
questing the City Attorney for an |
opinion as to whether the board has j
the power to grant the franchise. In ;
the mr-antime the opposing interests j
will attempt to have the claims ar
bitrated.
The City Attorney was asked for j
an opinion as to whether the city is
required to pave Point Lobos avenue.
The committee reported in favor
of reducing the sidewalk widths of
California street from First avenue to
Thirty-third from nineteen to fifteen |
feet.
WOMAN ADMITS TIIAT SHE
STABBED HENRY RAFFIN
Mrs. Xellie Geary Makes Excuse She
Was Under the Influence
of Linuor.
Mrs. Nellie Geary, alias Raffln, who
was arrested early yesterday morning
for stabbing Henry Raffin in the abdo
men with a knife, was questioned by
Captain Burnett yesterday. She ad
mitted committing the deed, but
paid that she scarcely knew what she
was doing, as she was under the in
fluence of liquor at the time.
Raffin, who is in a critical condi
tion at the Central Emergency Hos
pital, made an ante-mortem statement
to Assistant Bond and Warrant Clerk
Ward yesterday. He said he had been
living with the woman for about six
years. She came home shortly before
1 o'clock in a drunken condition and
raised a disturbance. He told her to
keep quiet and she went to a closet
where she kept her knives. He tried
to grab hold of her hand, but she was
too quick for him and stabbed him.

Thomas Mag-ec, representing: the
Adornment Association and the prop
erty interests of Market street, ap
peared before the Board of Works
to urge the repaying of Market street,
from Second to Valencia, and other
adjacent streets, such as Mason, Turk.
Eddy and Ellis, for which provision
has been made in the bond issue.
The committee wanted an assurance
from the board that it would sanc
tion the improvement and agreed to
insure the -purchase of municipal
bonds for street improvements to the
amount of $143,000 in addition to the
5475,000 to be purchased for the
paving and sewering of Mission street
from Ninth to East, and Fourth street
from Howard to Berry.
Law said it was thought advisable
to have a pavement on Market street
similar to that on Third street, but
the character of the pavement wouia
be left to the board, he said. The
board gave the committee unanimous
assurance that the work would be
recommended to the Board of Su<>
pervisors forthwith, and ordered a
resolution to that effect prepared.'
Law informed the board that he
thought he could secure bids on the
bonds to the extent ot $250,000, the
difference above $143,000 to be
taken in hospital bonds.
The same committee appeared be
fore the SuDervisors' Street Commit
tee and received: a similar assurance
that the Improvements described
would be ordered.
The board referred to the City At
torney for an opinion regarding the
respective claims of the City Engineer
and the attorneys for the Henry Cow
ell estate relative to the correct lines
of Clay and Merchant streets. The
estate is about to erect a building on
the north side of Clay street on a
line with the other buildings on the
block and running along Sansome
street to Merchant. The City En
pineer says the building so construct
ed on Clay street will encroach eigh
teen Inches on the street, but that
the estate would be entitled to eigh
teen inches additional on Merchant
street. The attorneys for the estate
take a contrary view and have ad
vised their clients to build flush with
the other buildings on Clay street.
The board also adopted a resolu
tion ordering bids to be invited for
the repair of bituminous pavements
on the following streets in addition to
those already published:
Valencia street, from Market to
Eighteenth : Polk, from Sutter to
Jackson; Grant avenue, from Market
street to Bush; Pine, from Sansome
to Battery; O'Farrell, from Powell
to Stockton; Jessie, from Second to
New Montgomery; Stevenson, from
Annie to Third; New Montgomery,
from Market to Mission.
The Health Board was requested to
investigate the dangerous condition of
a building at 449 Chestnut street.
Frank McSheehy was the lowest
bidder on the contract to build a fire
engine house on Twenty-sixth aye-Â»
nue for $10,576, ahd Spargo A Casey
the lowest bidder to build a safety
station at Market, Eddy and Powell
streets, for $1950, but the awards
went over one week.
Flinn & Treacy secured the contract
to repair certain bituminous streets
north of Market street for $640, and
the City Street Improvement for
some streets south of Market for $657.
Jessup Fund Cases Nonsuited.
Judge Seawell yesterday granted a
nonsuit in the two cases involving the
aileged misappropriation of the $3000
fund left by Hannah Jessup in 1892
for the care of her son, Louis B. Jes
sup, an inmate of the California Home
for the Care and Training of Feeble
minded Children. TlÂ»e actions were
brought by the present directors of the
institution against the directors who
expended the fund and Dr. W. M.
Lawlor, superintendent of the institu
tion.

THURSDAY FEBRUARY 16, 1905
THE ARMY CANTEEN.
NO one disputes the general value of the prohibition movement
â ^ â  counterbalance to the tendency toward excess. Its per
mce proves that it has a place in the moral scheme, and as
such it is entitled to respect. But. like all such movements, its zeal
â  n antagonizes discretion. By opposing all license laws it has
prevented the adoption of a general system of license, which would
greatly safeguard the habits of the people and entirely minimize
he abuse of what most thinkers regard as a natural appetite. Per
haps these excesses of zeal are natural to such a movement, and if so,
hey must be treated with patience and philosophy. It will* be well
f they are recognized as excesses, and the general prohibition idea
be held in respect notwithstanding. One of these excesses seems to
'.a\e been the antagonism of the army canteen by all the prohibi
. ionists of the United States.
Army officers are not so entirely separated from the civilian
community as to have no interest in its movement or its needs. But
.hey are specially qualified to observe and know what makes for the.
moral welfare of the enlisted men. who are in their charge. An
army officer is not the type of soldier described by Moore in Lalla
Rookh. He xas sensitive to what concerns human welfare as if he
had never worn a sword or served in battle. The canteen was
adopted by a consensus of opinion among army officers, who knÂ»*\v
the needs of the enlisted men and desired to go on in line with
human nature rather than cross and curb and oppose it.
Their policy was one of guidance rather than antagonism. They
believed that there was in every enlisted man the germ of good, which
might be extinguished by throwing, him persistently into evil com
panionship, or which might be cultivated and enlarged by using his
appetites to control his vices. To this end the army canteen was
established, as the club of the enlisted men. In it the use of beer i
and lijrht wine was permitted; and also that of the foods and relishes
which are part of the sociability among men. The profits of the
canteen went into a post library and to the maintenance, of corn
able reading rooms, and rooms where games and reasonable
amusements could be enjoyed.
The }*ood efTect was immediate. The enlisted men so preferred
eir own cfub. its comforts, books, newspapers ancV amusements.
*hat the fringe of deadfalls around every army post disappeared
through lack of patronage. The degradation and disease generated
in those dives were purged out of the army. Discipline was benefited
and the enlisted men took pride in their appearance and in their
part in making their command a credit to the flag it followed. But |
the prohibition element of the country, with the best of intentions, >
found itself appalled to see the Government of the United States
â¢ie liquor traffic, as its zeal moved it to describe the canteen.
It besieged Congress, and that susceptible body abolished the
canteen. In this the prohibitionists found themselves in alliance
with the liquor dealers, who found their profits abridged by the en
listed men's clubs, and desired a return to the old system. The corn
able club, the post library which it maintained, and all of the
iforts which it supported disappeared. We all saw this process
in San Francisco. The line of deadfalls reappeared. Sophisticated
liquors and evil associations moved up within tempting distance of the
enlisted men, and demoralization ensued. The health of the men
lias been worsted. Discipline has suffered and debauchery has taken
the place of the elevating influences of the library, reading and rea- j
-hie indulgences, permitted by the canteen.
These results have brought the question up again. The officers '
of the army, with fair unanimity, desire the canteen restored. They I
want the habits and morals of the enlisted men again brought un
<ler reasonable control. In this they are supported by their wives and
families, who have to live at the army posts and are concerned as
lie morals and habits of the enlisted men. They know more about
the matter, practically, than the excellent ladies of the \V. C. T. U.
can possibly know, and Congress can well afford to respect their
â¢pinions. Secretary Taft obviously favors the canteen, and has
takea measures to secure the independent and unbiased opinions of
army officers.
It would seem reasonable to heed the wishes of these officers and
ladies, who are in contact with the matter, rather than entirely give
â  ay to theorists, who are far removed from the subject upon which
they have heretofore dictated to Congress. The issue is. the canteen
against the deadfall ; the club against the dive ; the library against
-lebauchery. The morals and habits of the young men who enlist in
the army cannot be treated by the country with indifference.
GOVERNMENT SHIPPING COMPETITION.
IX the report of Representative Gallinger of the recently dissolved
â¦Merchant Marine Commission attention is called to the anomaly
presented by the competition of the Government transport service
with the shipping lines of the Pacific. Commissioner Gallinger
hat both at Puget Sound and San Francisco earnest demand
was made for the abandonment of the Government carrying business
{ The findings of the commission both at this port and at the
northern cities disclose the fact that not only is the Federal transport
service carried on with more expense to the Government than would
be incurred from the use of private shipping lines, but that the per
manence of the transport service in the field of freight traffic would
effect a direct and powerful influence against the already hard
messed ascendency which American ships hold in the Oriental trade.
The rate of profit which appears to be gained to the Government by
the utilization of its own steamers in preference to those of the com
panies does not remain a tenable argument in favor of the continu
ance of this branch of the army service, as the commission is free to
admit, because of the fact that the Government neither insures nor
pays taxes on its ships or cargoes. With these factors eliminated the
Government transport service ai\d private shipping lines stand on
common ground of efficacy and economy.
It is the opinion of the commission that the Government should
no longer remain a competitor in the Pacific trade, when already the
subsidized competitors of other nations have a leverage over Ameri
can lines. The military power of the United States," says Com
missioner Gallinger, "will be not the loser but the gainer by an en
lightened policy tending to increase the number of modern American
steamships available for use and to strengthen our commerce with
the Orient."
A DEMOCRATIC FIGHT.
THE Hearst-Sullivan incident in the House closed with the
honors awarded to Mr. Sullivan, and Hearst decidedly worsted.
His system of attacking men in his own party by assaults on
their private character was given a racking setback by the House,
\ hen Republicans and Democrats joined in an ovation to Sullivan
after his frank narrative of the unfortunate incident used by Hearst
to back up the charge that his fellow-Democrat was a murderer. Mr.
Sullivan exhibited self-control, restraint and ability in his statement
to his colleagues. The impression left upon the House was that in
stead of being attacked and abused he was entitled to the highest
credit for overcoming the handicap, and by natural talent and not
inherited wealth reaching a position of high honor in the country,
and enjoying the confidence of his fellow men.
The attack on him was almost the only speech made by Hearst
in the House, and it will probably be his last. The fearlessness of the
Massachusetts man has broken the spell and nerved others to re
taliate when defamed and abused, and Mr. Hearst's record is so rich
in material that he will do well not to provoke its use. His San
Francisco paper devoted fifteen columns to the affair, as if it were
the one topic of absorbing public interest, but Sullivan's answer
made vanity of that display of type.'
They say "Sir Tommy" Upton will build three Shamrocks in the endeavor
to gft one fast enough. But it is the four-leaved shamrock that has the
repute of bringing luck. â New York World. ' â 
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL", THURSDAY, FEBRUARY lfi. 1905,
MISCONSTRUED
CHARLES H. CHAMBERLIN
"Margaret, your mother has
asked me to perform a very
difficult task."
JOHN CARROLL sat tipped back
in his office chair, his feet
perched comfortably on the
desk in front of him. The cllck
, click of a typewriter, mingled with
: the murmur of voices, came to him
indistinctly through the closed door,
the curtain of which was drawn â sig
nal to his office force that he was busy
and must on no accoupt be disturbed.
Leaning over, Carroll took a letter
from the desk and carefully reread it.
It ran as follows:
"LONDON. England.
"Dear Mr. Carroll â Mother is writ
ing to friends at home and has asked
me to let you know that we are sail
ing for New York Wednesday (to
day's Monday) on the Brichtland. It
is a slow boat and brings us to port a
â week from Saturday. Please come
and meet us. We shall be utterly
helpless in that roar and bustle after
the two years spent in this slow-going
hemisphere.
"I wonder if mother's 'legal ad
viser' has changed and if we will rec
ognize him at the pier. As for me,
foreign capitals have added three
inches to my height, besides the dig
nity of a presentation at court.
"Until the coming Saturday, faith
fully,
" MARGARET CLEARWATER."
Thal^ signature meant so much and
so little!
Another letter, in finer hand, read:
"Dear John â Margaret is writing
for your help on our arrival, but I
need your help right away. A young
fellow from Pittsburg, named Rich
ards, met Margaret at a country house
in Devonshire six months ago and has
been devoted to her ever since. How
devoted I did not dream until she told
me yesterday that Jhe had proposed.
In spite of my protests because of their
youth, Margaret has promised him an
ariSwer in two months. For thÂ« iast
year I have been trying to persuade
her to accept an Englishman, who has
Â» tidy brewing business in Yorkshire
and who has been her constant
'shadow,' but she says she will marry
an American or die a bachelor girl.
"Now, John, pelase look this fel
! low up financially. I am not yet per
suaded that he is not after Margaret's
money. And when we get home, do
'â  use your influence with her to post
pone the whole business until she
comes of age.
"How good it will seem to be within
easy reach of your sound advice once
mere! Sincerely,
"EVELYN CLEARWATER."

ANSWERS TO QUERIES.
A DATE â Subscriber, City. The
last Thursday in June, 1867, fell on
the 27th.
RECORDING â A. S., City. If you
own a piece of property and wish to
have the same recorded it must be
so recorded in the county in which
the property is situated.
CONVICTION â G. D. M.. Verona,
Cal. In the State of California an
individual convicted of a felony and
sentenced to imprisonment in a pen
itentiary of the State loses his civil
rights, and the right of suffrage is one
of these. Such are not restored ex
cept by a full pardon.
ACKNOWLEDGMENT â E. 8.,
Oakland, Cal. The receipt of a court
esy, be it in the form of tickets to an
entertainment or anything, should al
ways fee acknowledged, unless the
party extending the courtesy should
notify the recipient that an ac
knowledgment is not necessary.
FRENCH REPUBLICâ A. S., City.
The third or present republic of
France became such in 1871. On Au
gust 31 of that year Louis Adolphe
Thiers, who was appointed chief of
the executive power February 17, was
appointed President of the republic
and held the office until May 24, 1873,
when he resigned.
A CITIZEN'S RIGHTâ G. D., City.
An alien who came to this country,
became a citizen and desires to re
turn to the land of his birth, is at
liberty to do so and may remain in
such country as long as he pleases.
If. however, he, at the time he left
his native land, owed the country mil
itary duty he would be liable to be
placed in the army to perform that
duty. In Germany persons of that
class, by courtesy to the United
States, are permitted to remain for a
period of four months and if they
leave before the expiration of that
time they are not called upon to en
ter the military service.
Carroll had joined Stephen Clearwater
as his private secretary. For five years
he and Margaret (Clearwater's only
child) had been very good chums.
She always levied her tribute of candy
on him whenever he appeared at her
house and usually managed to accom
pany him on his drives when over
seeing her father's real estate inter
ests.
Then! he had started his own busi
ness, she had gone away to school and
they had not met until her home
coming" for her father's funeral, short
ly after which she and her mother had
, sailed for Europe. As Carroll revlew
[ er] his life for the past ten years he
i acknowledged to himself that he could
not tell just when It was that he had
fallen in love with Margaret. Certain
it was, she had never discovered his
affection, much less reciproated it.
He had let her go to Europe without
making any sign, thinking that there
would be plenty of time after her re
turn. And now she was returning
practically engaged to another man,
and the castles he had been building
for the past two years had suddenly
tumbled about his ears.
It flashed upon him that her ship
was due in a couple of days and that
it devolved upon him to look up this
young Richards in the meantime.
Saturday found Carroll at the pier.
Emerging from the rush of passengers
Mrs. Clearwater greeted him with the
warmth and affection of a mother.
Margaret offered her hand in a formal
way and turned to bid adieu to ac
quaintances of the voyage. Customs of
ficials dispensed with, Carroll saw the
mother and daughter safely ensconced
in a cab and left them, to rejoin Mrs.
Clearwater at their hotel after dinner.
"Well, John," Mrs. Cloarwater said as |
he entered the room that night, "I've
sent Margaret off to her room so we
can have a talk alone. You can see her
later, but I must retire early and sleep
off the rolling: of the ship. First, I want
to know what you learned about young
Richards. He's all right socially, but
I'm not perfectly sure he's not after
Margaret's money."
"I've made inquiries among my
friends," replied Carroll in a dry voice,
"and find his family fortunes consider
ably more than double Margaret's in
heritance."
Mrs. Clearwater smiled.
"Truthfully, John, I don't believe the
girl really loves him, though when I
try to talk her out of her determina
tion to give him a final answer in two
months she insists she will accept him.
The^dea that you were to be consulted
made her furious."
"I feel she is wholly right about It.
Mrs. Clearwater," interrupted Carroll.
"She knows she is responsible to you
alone, and I am sure that whatever I
might say would not only fail to con
vince but would' sacrifice her friend
ship, a thing which I am very anxious
to retain."
Margaret's entrance cut short further
conversation. Mrs. Clearwater excused
herself, and Carroll found himself alone
with the girl.
"Margaret, your mother has asked
me to perform a very difficult task,"
he began, "but â "
She looked ur> at him and there was
steel in her eyes.
"I have declined her request. Instead,
I must tell you what has been in my
heart for a long time. I love you,
Margaret, have loved you â for how
many years I do not know."'

take care of you â In a different way.
And now, Miss Hardheart, how long
have you loved me without giving any

"Stupid!" she replied with a gleam
of mischief in her eye. "When I told
you that you would have to take care
of me I meant it in the way you
thought I didn't mean it."â (Copyright,

President's Widow
Gets $20,000
a Year for Child
MRS. MARY L. HARRISON.
GIVEN an annual income of $20,
000 a year for a six-year-old girl
it is doubtful If many American
mothers would make as good a
showing' as has Mrs. Mary Lord
Harrison, widow of the late President,
in her guardianship of her daughter,
Elizabeth Harrison, says the Chicago
Chronicle. In her report recently
filed with the courts Mrs. Harrison, in
her own handwriting; gives an item
ized account of the smallest expenses
connected with the care of her little
daughter. The report shows that out
of the interest and principal from her
father's estate little Elizabeth received
$42,732 94 for the period from No
vember 15, 1902, to November 8, 1904,
of which $1416 was spent by her care
ful mother. Included in this amount
was a trip to Europe and the salary
and care of a maid. During the two
yearn Miss Elizabeth has had four
different maids, and the amount paid
to each one is given in the itemized
account. It does not, however, state
the reasons for the frequent changes.
Little Miss Harrison is a very pretty
child and bids fair to grow ud with
her mother's accomplishments ajid
graces. Just at present she is busy
learning how to read and write.
WHEN A WOMAN RUNS.
Professor Masbn of Washington says
that woman is not built for running,
adding that "she may walk like a god
dess, but she runs like a hen." There is
good ground for the outspoken Pro
fessor Mason's remark, as contempor
ary observation discloses, but one can
not justly attribute it to any more deep
seated reason than skirts. Diana, who
would hardly "give unto the flying hart
space to breathe, how short soeven,"
was not incumbered with flapping pet
ticoats, nor did Atalanta outdistance her
pantingâ if pantslessâ suitors under
the handicap of even a rainy-day skirt.
Nor, if magazine illustrations are to be
believed, do the young Amazons of the
girls' colleges run 100 yards in eleven
seconds or thereabout in the garb they
wear at a dance. The. "winning wave
deserving note in the tempestuous pet
ticoat" has nothing to do with winning
foot races, and Professor Mason should
attribute woman's (alleged) hen-like
gait to the fashion of her clothes rather
than to the fashion of her making.
Even under this handicap some wom
en can run more like hares than hens.
Detective Hawley could inform the
Washington educator on this point. Al
though not exactly built to rival a
Duffy, Hawley can catch up with most
of the truant boys he has to arrest, but
Julia Shea, a 16-year-old girl, ran rings
around him and finally disappeared un
der a bridge. Anyway, some hens can
run faster than others. â Portland Ore

SMALL COIN DEMAND.
That the demand for small change to
supply the retail trade is rapidly in
creasing is shown by a statement is
sued by Superintendent Landis of the
United States Mint. This, demand is
generally taken as a criterion of the
prosperous condition of the United
States and is considered one of the
most accurate gauges. The following
figures represent the smaller coinage at
the Mint since President Roosevelt be
came President: $5,540,000 in half-dol
lars, $7,800,000 in quarter-dollars, $5,
800,000 in dimes, $4,500,000 in nickels and
$2,600,000 in cents. This makes a total
of $26,000,000 in subsidiary silver and
minor coins during the three years. The
nickel coinage during the three years
mentioned represents about one-fifth
of the entire nickel coinage of the coun
try, and the cent coinage represents
about one-seventh of the entire cent
coinage since the organization of
the Federal Government. â Philadelphia

MORGAN S START.
The foundation ot the great wealth
of J. P. Morgan waa laid by the great
fire which swept New York City in
1835. At that time Mr. Morgan's
father was a youth of 15 years and a
dry goods clerk in Hartford and his
grandfather was a modest innkeeper.
He was the proprietor of the City Ho
tel in Hartford. When the flames
swept New York in 1835 one of the nre
insurance companies of Hartford was
known to be a heavy loser. It had not
then become so great a financial insti
tution that it could face such a los>3
without misgivings. Many stockholders
became alarmed and offered shares at
a great sacrifice.
As usual, such topics were discussed
in the hotel corridors and :.lr. Morgan
waa offered much stock nearly as a
grift. John Warburton, who was then
one of the wealthiest men in the coun
try, advised him to take all he could
get at these prices and advanced the
money to him. The innkeeper began
buying and soon had bought a major
ity of the stock at prices ranging from
2^ to 10 cents on the dollar. Six lead
ing men of Hartford then signed a note
for $100,000, discounted it at the Hart
ford Bank and placed the proceeds at
the disposal of the insurance company.
The company met all of its loses and
wrote a large amount of new business.
The result was a great boom for the
company and Mr. Morgan found him
self worth $150,000 when the tangles
were straightened out.
Mr. Morgans first thought waa for
his son, who was working as a dry
goods clerk. He decided that his son.
Junius S. Morgan, should become a
merchant. An interest was bought for
him in a large mercantile bouse in
Boston. The firm prospered and in a
few years young Morgan sold his In
terest for $500,000. He continued in the
mercantile business for several yemrs
longer, however, and increased his for
tune to the extent of $400,000. Junius
S. Morgan then determined to go to
London, where he became a. partner of
George Peabody. the American banker.
There he adhered to- the same strict in
tegrity which had made him successful
in his native country, and he began to
train his son. J. Pierpont Morgan, in
the same way. J. P. Morgan worked
for years In the foreign exchange de
partment of his father's banking
house, until he was recognized as one
of the leading foreign experts in thÂ»
world. He then returned to the United
States. To-day J. Pierpont Morgan is
believed to be worth more than $100,
000,000.âPhiladelphia Inquirer.

rJJKPAKKFOUMEMOBIAL
Hundredth Anniversary of
Schiller's Death Is to Be
Fittingly Commemorated.
The German American societies of
the State have now under consideration
two project* of great importance â the
erection of a German building in this
city and the commemoration of the one
hundredth anniversary of Schiller's
death on May D.
The rroject of the building has been
under consideration for some time, but
nu active etcDs were taken toward its
realization until a few weeks ago. Then
Eureka Lod^e of the order of Her
mann's Sons laid the matter before the
main order. The organization recom
mended to the German-American
League, which embraces all Teutonic
societies in the State, that a committee
be appointed to forward the project.
The officers of the league received the
recommendation enthusiastically, and a
committee composed of the most prom
inent Germans in the State' will be
named to act in the matter. One of the
most fervent advocates of the idea Is
Professor H. K. Schilling, president of
the leagu*.
The need of a building to be used as
a nome for the German societies has
been realized by the members of every
verein and club In the State. But while
there has been much talk there has not
been any evidence of action or concert
ed determination until recently. Fur
ther steps will be taken when the
league meets next Monday.
In regard to the celebration of the
Schiller anniversary the German-Amer
ican League has decided to begin early.
It is determined to make the affair one
of the most memorable of its kind.
Every German society will work to
ward that end.
The following committee has been
named to forward the memorial project,
and from the list will probably be se

of the building:

MUSCOVITE
CLEVER ACTRESS WHO IS MAK
ING HIT IN "MOTHER GOOSE"
AT THE GRAND.
Government Not
Liked, Neither
Is Jap.
Neva Aymar, who has made such a
hit as Jill in the Klaw & Erlanger ex
travaganza, "Mother, Goose," at the
Grand Opera-house, is one of the most
charming comediennes on the stage.
She Is dainty and chic, full of spark
ling vivacity and sings and dances
with grace and ability. Miss Aymar
is a native of Russia. Her father was
a celebrated musician, and, unfortun
ately, one of his compositions became
so popular with the Socialists as to
incur for him the displeasure of the
Russian Government.
Orders were given for Aymar's ar
rest, but a friendly warning enabled
him to escape to this country, bringing
with him his wife and baby child. Al
though Miss Aymar has a strong dis
like for the Russian Government her
sympathies are with her country in its
present conflict with Japan. An excel
lent and true story illustrating this fact
is told of her. About two months ago
an admirer sent her as a present a val
uable tiny Japanese pug. Completely
ignorant of its breed, she patriotically
named it "Kuropatkin." The laughter
of the company, however, revealed to
her her mistake, and In disgust she be
stowed the dog on the stage doorkeep
er, who lost no time in converting his
valuable present into cash.
BAEHR NOT READY TO
ANSWER MAYOR'S DEMAND
Auditor Looks Up Points of Law on
Payment of Grand Jury
Expenses.
Auditor Baehr did not frame a re
ply yesterday to the letter from Mayor
Schmitz making formal demand upon
him to reimburse the city for audited
demands for Grand Jupy expenses al
leged to have been Illegally incurred.
Baehr was busy looking up points of
law raised by the Mayor to show that
the expenditures were not in conson
ance with the charter and the State
law. Baehr Is looking up counter au
thorities in defense of his action in
auditing demands accompanied by
court orders. He expects to have his
reply completed some time to-day,
when it will be forwarded to the
Mayor.
Baehr seems to be placed in an
awkward position. On one hand the
Superior Court orders the demands
paid and should he refuse to audit
them he will incur the displeasure of
the court and probable punishment for
contempt. On the other hand the
charter vests the Mayor with certain
powers and the refusal of Baehr to
comply with the Mayor's request may
result unpleasantly.
The Grand Jury will take no notice
of the attitude of the Mayor toward
its expense bills. The matter was
considered yesterday and the decision
reached to ignore the complaints of
the chief executive altogether.
"We do not think the Mayor is act
ing wisely," said E. J. Bowes, chair
man of the police committee, which
incurred the greatest share of the bills
that Mayor Schmitz says Auditor
Baehr has allowed illegally. "We have
deemed it best to pay no attention to
criticisms of the administration of
ficials."
ITALIAN GRAND OPERA
HERE ANOTHER WEEK
Theatrical Maladjustments in Havana
Permits of Company Extending
the Season.
The announcement that the grand
opera season at the Tivoli will be ex
tended another week will be hailed
with great satisfaction by music-loving
San Francisco. This unexpected ar
rangement was only entered into late
yesterday afternon and was rendered
possible by the receipt of a cablegram
from the director of the Grand Opera
house, Havana, which stated that a
postponement of a week in the open
ing of the grand opera season in that
city was absolutely necessary owing
to a complication with a dramatic
company playing there.
The new arrangement will cause the
grand opera season at the Tivoli to
close Sunday night, February 26, when
a special farewell programme will be
presented. To-night Tetrazzini will
sing Violetta in "Traviata." To-mor
rcw night Berlindi will be heard in
"Tosca." Saturday matinee "Rigo
letto" will be given, with Tetrazzini,
and Saturday night '"La Boheme."
with Berlindi. Sunday night Tetras
zini willing "Lucia." The repertoire
for the first three performances 6f
next week is as follows: Tuesday, "The
Pearl Fishers," with Tetrazzini;
Wednesday, "Mignon," with Berlindi,
and Thursday, "Dinorah," with Tetraz
zini.
Next Sunday afternoon at 2 o'clock
a grand symphony concert will be
given at the Tivoli by an orchestra of
seventy-five, under the direction of
Signor Polacco. Tetrazzini will be the
soloist and a magnificent programme
will be presented.

steady tread to the festal board, where i
were seated a few guests of honor, in
cluding Archbishop Montgomery.
The hall was tastefully decorated in
honor of the occasion and an orchestra j
dispensed strains of sweet music as the j
feast progressed. His Grace, Arch- '

a proud man, surrounded by the boys

great cause of temperance.
Besides the Archbishop there were

greeted with the hearty cheers of the
boys when he arose. His remarks well
fitted the occasion and though brief
were full of feeling and inspiration.
His Grace told of the duty each mem
ber of the regiment owed the church
and told of the progress, trials and
struggles of Catholicism. The remarks
of the Archbishop were received with
enthusiastic applause.
Mr. Phelan responded to Toastmaster
Colonel Powers' toast "Our Country."
He was followed by Luke Carroll, who
spoke of the "League of the Cross,"

MANY CHECKS ARE READ
IN YOELL WILL CONTEST
Son of Santa Clara Pioneer Says His
Father Acted Boyishly In a
Courtroom.
Much of the hearing of the Yoell
will contest in Judge Kerrigan's court
yesterday was devoted to the reading
of checks produced by Attorney Del
mas. They dated back as far as 1884,
and many were evidently part of the
h<Jbsehold expenses of the Yoell fanu
iry.
John H. Yoell was on the stand in
the morning and testified as to his
father's demeanor at certain times.
On one occasion in Judge Seawell's
court the witness described his
father's manner as being silly. "The
look on his face would not have been
expected from a man In sound
mind," declared the witness. "His
answers were intelligent enough, but I
can best describe his manner by say
ing that it was boyish."
Yoell declared that on another oc
casion his father called him a dog
and declared that he ought to be in
San Quentin.
The reading of a complaint against
Mrs. Yoell, alleging that she had tried
to borrow money on false pretenses,
drew the indignation of the counsel
for the contestants. "It is not true,"
asserted the counsel.
The case will be resumed st 10:30
tc-day.
California Council Entertains.
California Council, National Union,
held a rousing open meeting In Pio
neer Hall last night, there being near
ly 250 persons present to enjoy the
very entertaining programme that
had been arranged by Speaker E. C.
Ker. After an address of welcome by
President Burns the California qilar
tet rendered a number of vocal selec
tions, after which theite were solos by
Messrs. Purdy, Kilmer and Smith.
General Deputy Joseph A. Wilson had
â¢something to say for the good of the
order and why those who are not
under fraternal protection should
join the National Union. J. O. Ir
vine entertarned with a bone solo,
Charles Morrell gave banjo selections,
members of the San Francisco Turn
Verein gave an exhibition of wand
exercise, fencing and boxing, songs by'
M. Foster of Berkeley Council and a
monologue by M. K. Hill. During the
evening the council served refresh
ments and cigars.

HYDE'S SCALP SOUGHT
Jacob Schiff Drawn Into the
Disturbance and Has a
Clash With the President
NEW YORK. Feb. 15. â The move
ment to take the control of the Equit
able Life Assurance Company from
the stockholders and place it with the
policy holders Is to be taken up by
the board of managers to-morrow. At
that meeting: two petitions will be pre
sented to the board, each signed by
thirty-nine officers of the society, in
cluding the president and two of the
four vice presidents, one petition ask
ing that the control of the society be
taken from the stockholders and given
to the policy holders, and the other
declaring it to be the opinion of the
signers that the re-election of James
H- Hyde, who is thÂ© owner of 51 per
cent of the stock, as first vice presi
dent would be prejudicial to the In
terests of the society.
It was disclosed to-day that at the
meeting of the directors on Wednes
day last, when the petition was pre
sented demanding the retirement of
Hyde and the "mutualization" of the
Equitable, there ensued a vigorous
discussion of the subject.
A motion was made by Jacob Schlff
for a committee to Investigate and re
port on the questions Involved. Tar
bell moved to lay this motion on the
table and to substitute a committee to
be nominated by the president. Alex
ander is said to have left the chair
and taken the floor and to have stat
ed that he thought that Schlff's mo
tion was an Insult to him as president
of the company and was an intimation
by Schiff that he would not appoint an
Impartial committee. He then ap
pealed to the members of the board
present to sustain him in this position.
â¢A spirited discussion followed, but
Tarbell's motion was voted down and
Schiff's resolution prevailed.
Schiff to-day authorized the follow
ing statement:
He (Schiff) first learned some twelve days
ago of the trouble which was brewing, when
he was called upon by counsel for Mr. Alex
ander, who advised him of Mr. Alexander's
determination to oust Mr. Hyde from, the coÂ»
trol of the company through a movement to
transfer the control to the policy holders.
Mr. Rchlff from the outset declared himself
as unqualifiedly In favor of participation . by
the policy holders In the control of the socletj.
insisting, however, that It should and muÂ«t
be brought about In a dignified, orderly and
just manner; further, that the board of trus
tees should become directly responsible to
the policy holders for the management of the
company rather than that the control should
pass to the executive officers through the
obtatnme-nt In their own names of the proxies
of the policy holders.

But symptoms of relaxation in thÂ« foreign

SOON TO TALK
WITH PANAMA
Agents Are Preparing to
Effect Wireless Communi
cation With the Isthmus
STATION AT THE PALACE
Abraham White Is Planning
to Connect AVith Hawaii,
Philippines and Orient
San Francisco will soon be in direct
communication with the Philippines,
the Orient and the Hawaiian Islands
by means of wireless telegraph. Before
this innovation is enjoyed, however,
the city will have a similar means of
communication with Panama by a di
rect coast route and by way of the East
via Denver, Kansas City. Chicago, New
York. Key "West, Porto Rico and Cuba.
It is for the purpose of perfecting
these systems of communication that
Abraham 'White, president of the
American De Forest Wireless Tele
pruph Company, now registered at the
Palace Hotel, has come to the coast.
He arrived here two days ago and at
once leased a portion of a store on the
New Montgomery street side of the big
hostelry, where the company's first in
-6truments are to be installed and oper
ated through the medium of temporary
citations on the roof of the Palace. The
tirf tests of the machines will be made
at short ranees between Point Reyes
and Mare Island and this city.
For severaJ months engineers of the
company have been here looking for
6UitAble" sites for five big stations,
â which President White says will soon
be erected in San Francisco and its
vicinity, for the purpose of receiving
end sending messages to Hawaii, the
Philippines and other points in the
Orient. Just where these stations will
be placed he is not yet prepared to
state, giving as a reason that leases for
the cites have not been secured. In dis
cussing his plans yesterday White said:
We raT t to have our instruments In the
Palace Hotel operating for short range com
munication in about five weeks. The man
asrjiwnt of the hotel he* grained us permis
eion to make our preparatory tiests with the
eid ot the flap masts on top of the hostelry,
By Monday we hope to have communication
between the hotel and Point Reyes and Mare
Island as a test for our Instruments. Fifty
six s-tations are now working perfectly on the
Atlantic seaboard and another series of sta
tions has been Installed between Chicago and
Kansas City. \Ve have recently established
a email station in Denver that will shortly
b* replaced with a larger one. through which
rnir.munlca.tion will be extended westward from
Kar.s-us City and finally to the Pacific sea
board.
During: the coming week President
White- wBI open negotiations with the
managements â < the ocean steamship
aniee vith a view to having sev
â¢ lytec between here
and 0 â  and the Antipodes fitted
out with â wireless tHfpraph instru
ments, the purpose being to extend the
modern method of communication,
which wi!l be rapidly perfected, as it
tke Atlantic Ocean. With
â¢ '.rk accomplished a passenger on
â¢ s-f>amer. should he so de
â â '. ill be able to communicate with
eter aboard an Oriental or Aus
tralian steamer. Continuing his diseus
oo wireless telegraphy. President
White said:
The value of the new method of telegraphy
haÂ« already been thoroughly exploited and the
Greatest amount of mental energy is now be
ing employed to perfect the service. Our
company is preparing to establish tor the Gov
ernment a circuitous service to Panama by
way of the Eastern seaboard, with stations
at Guantanamo (Cuba), Key West, Pensacola
and Porto Rico, which will be in touch with
the ptations in New Tork, through which the
iFthmus will communicate with the New Eng
land States, Boston. Washington. Philadelphia,
Prov-li^nc, New Haven, Springfield, Mass.,
and Bridgeport. Conn. Additional stations are
now rearing completion in Buffalo, along the
Or*Â»t Lakes at points like Chicago and Port
Huron ar.d ft. Louis. The establishing of a
coast servie* to Panama will be hurried to
completion and by. the time the Western slope
has bees placed in communication with the
East we hope to have extended the service to"
navaJ bases In foreign countries.

THE VALUE OF CHARCOAL. i
Few People Know How Useful It Is In 1
Preserving Health and Beanty. i
Nearly everybody knows that char- I
coal is the safest and most efficient]
disinfectant r.nd purifier in nature, but â¢
few realize its value when taken into j
the human system for the same cleans-
ing purpose.
Charcoal is a remedy that the more
you take of it the better; It is not a
drug at all, but simply absorbs the
gases and impurities always present in
the stomach and intestines and carries
them out of the system.. â¢ i
Charcoal sweetens the breath after
smoking, drinking or after eating
onions and other odorous vegetables. '
Charcoal effectually clears and Im- j
proves the complexion, it whitens the
teeth and further acts as a natural
and eminently safe cathartic. \
It absorbs the injurious gases which
collect in the stomach and bowels; it
disinfects the mouth and throat from
the poison of catarrh.
All druggists sell charcoal in one
form or another, but probably the best
charcoal and the most for the money
is In Stuart's Charcoal Lozenges; they
are composed of the finest powdered
Willow charcoal and other harmless
antiseptics in tablet form, or rather In
the form of large, pleasant tasting
lozenges, the charcoal being mixed
with honey.
The daily use of these lozenges will
soon tell in a much improved condi-
tion of the general health, better com-
plexion, sweeter breath and purer
bicod, and the beauty of it is that no
possible harm can result from their
continued use, but, on the contrary,
great benefit.
. A Buffalo physician, In speaking of
the benefits of charcoal, says: "I ad-
vise Stuart's Charcpal Lozenges to all
patients suffering: from gas in stomach
and bowels, and to clear the complex-
Jon and purify the breath, mouth and
throat; I also believe the liver la great-
ly benefited by the daily, use of them;
they cost but twenty-live cents a box at
drug stores, and. although In Borne
sense a patent preparation, yet I be-
lieve I get more and better charcoal in
etuart's Charcoal Lozenges , than .: in
any of the ordinary charcoal' tablets."
VAUDEVILLE PERFORMANCE

Abounds as the Favorites Dance and Sing Fetchinglu.
TWO INTERESTING MAIDS OF THE SMART SET WHO CHARMED THE IMMENSE AUDIENCE AT THE ALHAMBRA THEA
TER LAST NIGHT BY THEIR CLEVER ACTING, AND A PATRONESS OF THE AUXILIARY OF THE CHILDREN'S
HOSPITAL. UNDER WHOSE AUSPICES THE AFFAIR WAS HELD.
MONACHE LANDS
ARE IN DISPUTE
Petition by Executor for
Permission to Seli Is
< Opposed by Lumberman
An opposition to the application of
W. H Metsan as administrator for
permission to sell the half interest be-
I'nping to the estate of Patrick Reddy
in the so-called Monache lands in the
Sierra forest reserve was filed yester
day by Thnmas B. Walker, a Minne
apolis lumberman and capitalist, who
<laims to own the lieu land "scrip" for
1960 acre? of thf lands in question. The
property, scattered throughout the re
serve, consists of about 9500 acres, half
hirh under Reddy 's will becomes
the property of his widow, Emily
Reddy. and his brother, Edward A.
Reddy. The other half was owned by
Mollie Conklin.
All the persons concerned were will
ing to sell and an order of court was
obtained in September, 1900, permitting
the transfer of the lands to the- United
States Government and granting the
right to sell the land subsequently se
lected In lieu thereof.
Walker alleges that the Reddys and
Mollie Conklin surrendered the forest
reserve lands to the Government and
received in lieu thereof the right to
select other public lands outside the
reserves. This surrender was made
through John A- Benson, who was in
the public land business, and the lieu
land "scrip" was turned over to him
as agent with authority to locate or
sell the same for his principals or to
sell the land thus located. Benson, is
now under indictment at Washington
for frauds in acquiring forest reserve
lands, but the Reddy lands are not
involved in this prosecution.
Between December, 1900, and March.
1901, says Walker, he purchased from
Benson the right to locate 1960 acres,
paying him $7105, and he believes that
a great part of the amount has been
paid into the estate. Walker has used
his rights to locate the acres, but has
not yet received a patent from the
Government. He declares that all the
required formalities for the transfer
were observed and he is entitled to the
distribution of 1960 acres before the
order of sale is made. He also denies
the statements in the petition of Met
son that the sale of the Monache lands
is necessary to pay the obligations of
the estate.
Nurse Surprises Burglar.
A burglar was surprised by Mrs.
Greyson, night nurse at the St.
Thomas Hospital, 300 Page street,
early yesterday morning. The nurse
came upon the scene suddenly and the
intruder jumped through a nearby
window. When the nurse saw him he
was busily engaged sorting the conÂ»
tents of the office desk. An exatni4i
tion revealed that the fellow had gone
through every drawer of the desk in
search of plunder. There were many
valuable articles and a quantity of
rash in the office, but the thief did not
have a chance to continue his search.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 16, 1905.
SALLY SHARP
Ap I sit me down to tell about that
vaudeville "stunt" at the Alhambrn
last nightâ "did" by society in the
name of sweet charity â the front rows
of my mind are filled with visions of
dashing Ethel Hager's pink frou-frous
and fripperies. Had I been a man, I
dare say they would have filled the
orchestra and the parquet of it. Urn'
Clever? Yes. admittedly clever from
start to finish. And many a time have
we paid our commercial money at the
r>rpheum for a tenth of the show we
saw last nisht by "amateurs."
"Amateur" is assuming a new mean
ing in this little Western town of ours,
and let the "talent" look to Its laurels,
for twice this week has the smart set
demonstrated what It can do in tho
line of entertaining behind the foot
lights.
The programme opened with a pot
pourri of types of beauty â miniatures,
the programmes said. And they were
pretty, very pretty. Likewise were
there no two types alike, and in that
alone was there cleverness. Those who
posed so alluringly were Miss Gene
vfeve King as A Poster, Mrs. Willard
Drown as Princess de Lamballe, Miss
Edith Berry as The Broken Pitcher,
Mrs. George Martin as Portrait of Mrs.
Robinson (Romney), Miss Anita Har
vey as A Lady of the Empire, Miss Vir
ginia Jolliffe as The Duchess D'Or
leans. Miss Gertrude Josselyn as Coun
tess Spencer, Miss Ethel Dean as Lady
Hamilton, Miss ' Mary Wilcox as A Lit
tle Maid of Holland, Miss Ysabel Brew
(!â  as A Gipsy Girl.
Then I came Mrs. John D. Spreckels
Jr., a dimpled little country lass, arch
and so in krve with the stage, who sang
"Little Mary Brown" â one of the fetch
ingest numbers of the bill. Flowers
enough to swamp her were passed over
the footlights, and she deserved every
posy she received.
"Johnny, I'll Take You," in Miss
Ethel Hager's hands â or voice and toes
â was a plum in the pudding. With
the most exquisite grace did the love
lorn maiden woo her new lover â lucky
Billy Smith! And how gracefully she
can kick! Assisting her were, besides
Mr. Smith, Thomas Eastland, Courtney
Ford, A. B. Brown, C. Baker, Vail
Bakewell, all in fascinating evening
togs, and pretty chappies they were.
The duet between Mrs. C. Frederick
Kohl and Ware Little, "Tell Me,
Dusky Maiden," was an interesting
number, Mrs. Kohl's voice surprising
many of her friends.
Ah! but her jewels! I doubt if there
was a woman in the house that didn't
fall to wondering how it would feel to
own a tenth of them.
"A Palp of Lunatics," a skit by
Courtney Ford, was presented by C.
K. Bonestell and Mrs. Fred. N.
McNear, evolving an intricate mental
and physical tangle, raising thereby
many a laugh, and from discrimating
lipe. be It known.
Camille d'Arville Crellin, in "Sing:
Me to Sleep," was as fascinating as
ever.
The scene from "Toyland," with Miss
Constance de Young leading, sup
ported by Miss Gertrude Josselyn, Mrs.
Will Gerstle, Courtney Ford and A. B.
Brown, was a famous hit, resulting in
half a score of encores.
Percy Kahn's clever imitations of
famous actors, and "My Little Canoe,"

SANDS' ABSENCE
IS UNEXPLAINED
Manufacturing Chemist Who
Fired Shot at Bartender
Disappears Mysteriously
Friends of Oliver Sands are puzzled
over his mysterious disappearance.
Sands is a manufacturing chemist and
was arrested last Friday morning on a
charge of assault to murder for firing
two shots at Max Dunrow, a bartender
in the Press saloon, 15 Third street. He
was released on $1000 cash bail, which
he took from a. safe deposit vault.
When the case was called in Police
Judge Fritz's court next morning
Sands was present with his attorney,
Frank Kelly. The case was continued
till yesterday and Sands promised to
call at his attorney's office that after
noon. He failed to make his appear
ance, and when the case was called
yesterday morning it was explained to
the Judge jthat Sands could not be
found. His bail was not forfeited, but
a bench warrant was issued for his ar
rest and the case continued till to-mor
row.
Detective Ryan has been detailed to
find Sanda. He ascertained that the
last time he was seen was at the safe
deposit vaults on Saturday afternoon.
He lives at the Graystone Hotel, on
Geary street, but he had not been seen
there since Saturday morning. His
valuable overcoat, pipes and tobacco
and other personal effects are in his
room, showing that he had intended
to return soon.
The police think that he may have
taken more money out of the safe de
posit box on Saturday afternoon and
spent some of it on liquor, making him
;a prey to some evilly disposed person.
| Either that, c-r he has left the city, be
' ing afraid that he might be convicted
,on the, charge of assault to murder and
sent to the State's prison.

MISTAKES MADE
BY SECRETARY
Hermann Schussler Explains
Errors in Estimates of
Value of the Waterworks
ACCOUNTS ABE 3IIXED
Pipe in the Eight Place
Entered in Wrong Column
for Engineer to Straighten
Yesterday was a season of explana
tions by Hermann Schussler '-â  of the
Spring Valley Water Works in re
sponse to cross-examination probings
by: Assistant ." City : and County Attor
ney John S. Partridge. The whole of
the day's session in United States Com
missioner Heacock's . court was â  taken
up in that way.
Mr. Schussler said that on February
24, 1904, he made a valuation of the
water company's property, including
reservoirs, reservoir sites, water sheds,
water â¢ rights, rights of way, artesian
lands, filter beds, etc., inclusive of its
value as: a going concern having an
established business, coupled with the
value of its franchises, at $29,919,400.
He estimated the construction work,
coupled with the properties in and
near San Francisco, {inclusive: of Lake
Merced, at $23,045,300; making a total
valuation of $52,964,700. Mr. Schus
sler continued: r .
In 1001*1 estimated the total value of the
property at $40,231, 750, and ' thereafter I said
that this total does not - Include the assessed
value of the franchise, which is nearly $5,400.
000 on which the company paid taxes. This
would bring up the total to f 400,000. M
The examination then ran thus:
In your statement, made In 1901 to the Su
pervisors,- you . estimated the com of the upper
Crystal Springs dam at $265,000; now, you
'say, it coat $365,000. How do you account for
that? !â -.:â¢-â 
â  I estimate it Inclusive of ten per cent for
incidentals. â¢ â â ,' â 
Partridgeâ call your attention to the fact
that In 1901 you stated the cost of the Crystal
Springs lower dam as $2,242,000, and that you
now state cost was $2,192,000. Please ex
plain the discrepancy. v ' â¢ . .
Mr. Schussler replied that he called
on Secretary Ames a year ago and told
the secretary that he thought that the
charge for the lowej- dam was exces
sive. On making an investigation into
the matter that some of the land pur
chased had been included in estimate
of $2,242,000, the witness continued:
Subsequently when I went to make up the
total estimate for 1903-04 I think I discovered
certain things that should have been charged
to the upper dam, and consequently the back
account of the upper Crystal Springs dam ap
peared smaller than â¢It should. The waste
weir, of the upper dam was probably charged
to the construction of the lower dam. In my
estimate for 1903-04 the labor . for the waste
weir has been charred "to the ; upper dam.
There is a difference of $50,000 between the
secretary's resort; and my estimate. . ,"
Mr. " Schussler " was â¢ asked as to the
discrepancy' between : his estimate of
$1,347,000 in 1901 for. the Crystal
Springs pipe line and J his estimate of
$1,095,600 in ; the present case for the
same property. , He replied: v
That was the figure furnished to me at the
time. Later ; I investigated It, and I believe
In' that estimate- is contained a large = portion
Of . the â  44, 47. '33 and 30 inch pipe. . Then -..1
asked Mr. â "<. Ames to give me the cost of the
plpo line from Crystal Springs to the city res
ervoir and he gave me. this. item of $1,347,000.
"Then," asked Mr. Partridge, "there
must have been a double charge given
to the Board of Supervisors?" .
lln reply, \ the \ englner said:
That is not my fault. Those were the- fig
ures given me by Mr. â¢ Ames â that there was
included in the -Crystal Springs pipe line a
large amount of pipe that . was ; laid in this
city. â¢ â¢ â¦ When â¢ this rase came up I
made up my mind that I would go to the bot
tom of every one of these Items of charges.
Anybody is liable â¢to make . a , mistake. If I
go. .as engineer, to the secretary who has
charge of the financial accounts and ask him
for a list of figures I can't very well -see, un
less . I positively - know j then and there that
there . Is an overcharge or a misstatement. I
have 'always .^corrected such In my estimate
made later to the Supervisor*. Cher my own
signature before the Supervisors I corrected a
mistake that was made by - the secretary in
1001. thereby amending it in my estimate.

ALICE SKAE'S
TRUST VALID
Judge Coffey, in Written
Opinion, Upholds Provi
sions of Attacked Will
Alice Warren Skae of New York
must be content for the remainder
of her'life with the income of the San
Francisco estate left by her mother,
Alice Skae. If she marries, her hus
band will receive $50,000 when he be
comes a widower. If children should
survive her, property now worth
$230,000 will be divided among them,
but if there is neither husband nor is
sue the estate will be distributed to
six persons residing in New York State
and Canada after a payment of $10.
000 has been made to the Children's
Hospital of this city and $10,000 to
the San Francisco Museum of Art for
the purchase of paintings.
The daughter, whose inheritance is
subject to these peculiar provisions,
sought to break her mother's will un
der the guise of a petition for a par
tial distribution of the estate to her.
wherein she attacked the validity of
the various trusts created by the will.
Her application was opposed by the
Mercantile Trust Company, trustee
under the will, and yesterday in a
long written opinion. Judge Coffey de
nied her petition and upheld the trust.
The property involved consists of
about $30,000 in money and the block
at the corner of Larkin and Fulton
streets, valued at $200,000. In her
original will Mrs. Skae directed the
demolition of the vault in the Oakland
Cemetery wherein were the remains
of her husband and two children, and
she ordered the construction of a new
vault to cost $20,000, but this provi
sion was later revoked by codicil and,
after the payment of certain expenses
and fees, the entire estate goes into
the life trust. Next week the court
will probably order the distribution
of all the property to the trust com
pany.
Judge Coffey's Interesting opinion
deals with the doctrine of "equitable
conversion." The basis of the daugh
ter's attack upon the will was in the
contention that the provision "to dis
tribute to the children" after her
death was a trust to convey real prop
erty and therefore void because ssuch
conveyance is inhibited by the law.
The three points made by the trus
tees were that the court should sus
tain the will rather than overthrow it;
that there was no trust to convey in
the will, and that authority was given
to the trustees to sell the realty, and
that the other provisions that the
property should be distributed aa per
sonal property rather than real estate
were sufficient to create an equitable
conversion.
Mrs. Skae's will authorized the trus
tees to sell or lease the realty and re
invest the proceeds, but there was no
direct command to do so. Because
the provision was not mandatory the
daughter contended that the benefi
ciaries under the will could elect to
take the land before any sale was
made. The court was of the opinion
that the use of the words "pay" and
"paid" in the will involved the idea of
liquidating the bequests in money or
its equivalent and it would be Impos
sible to carry out these terms of the
will without a sale of the property.
The duty to convert, therefore, results
from the duty of the trustee to carry
out the provisions of the will, and
this duty existing renders the discre
tion of making a sale imperative.
Upon this reasoning it is held that
the necessity of conversion to accom
plish the purposes of the will is equiv
alent to imperative direction to con
vert.
The Judge says: "Can this court,
without distorting her diction, destroy
her will and produce intestacy where
she clearly intended to dispose of
every particle of her property in pur
suance of an intelligent design in a
well wrought out scheme?"
Speculations of Fischer.
The cumulative evidence of Jacob
A. Fischer's speculative proclivities, j
; advanced by his sisters, Hannah and',
Augusta Samter, in support of their
demand that he and his brother be
required to give bonds for the faithful
administration of their mother's
estate, was added to yesterday by the
affidavit of Marks Samter. their
nephew, in which the young man de
clares that his uncle has made many
disastrous speculations. Judge Coffey
heard the affidavit, bu^ temporarily re
moved the matter of the petition for a
bond from the calendar pending the
promised fllinar by the administrator*
of a statement of the funda of the
estate.
